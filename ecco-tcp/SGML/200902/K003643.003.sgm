<HEAD>LECTURE XXXIV. MEANS OF IMPROVING IN ELOQUENCE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now treated fully of the different kinds of Public Speaking, of the Compo|&s;ition, and of the Delivery of a Di&s;cour&s;e. Be|fore fini&s;hing this &s;ubject, it may be of u&s;e, that I &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome things concerning the pro|pere&s;t means of Improvement in the Art of Public Speaking, and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tudies for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To be an Eloquent Speaker, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, is far from being either a common or an ea&s;y attainment. Indeed, to compo&s;e a florid harangue on &s;ome popular topic, and to deliver it &s;o as to amu&s;e an Au|dience, is a matter not very difficult. But though &s;ome prai&s;e be due to this, yet the idea, which I have endeavoured to give of Eloquence, is much higher. It is a great ex|ertion of the human powers. It is the Art of
<PB N="2" REF="5">
being per&s;ua&s;ive and commanding; the Art, not of plea&s;ing the fancy merely, but of &s;peak|ing both to the under&s;tanding, and to the heart; of intere&s;ting the hearers in &s;uch a degree, as to &s;eize and carry them along with us; and to leave them with a deep and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of what they have heard. How many talents, natural and acquired, mu&s;t con|cur for carrying this to perfection? A &s;trong, lively, and warm imagination; quick &s;en&s;ibi|lity of heart, joined with &s;olid judgment, good &s;en&s;e, and pre&s;ence of mind; all im|proved by great and long attention to Style and Compo&s;ition; and &s;upported al&s;o by the exterior, yet important qualifications of a graceful manner, a pre&s;ence not ungainly, and a full and tuneable voice. How little rea&s;on to wonder, that a perfect and accom|pli&s;hed Orator, &s;hould be one of the cha|racters that is mo&s;t rarely to be found?</P>
<P>LET us not de&s;pair however. Between mediocrity and perfection, there is a very wide interval. There are many intermedi|ate &s;paces, which may be filled up with honour; and the more rare and difficult that complete perfection is, the greater is the ho|nour of approaching to it, though we do not fully attain it. The number of Orators who &s;tand in the highe&s;t cla&s;s is, perhaps, &s;maller than the number of Poets who are foremo&s;t in poetic fame; but the &s;tudy of Oratory has this advantage above that of Poetry,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
that, in Poetry, one mu&s;t be an eminently good Performer, or he is not &s;upportable:
<Q><L>&mdash;Mediocribus e&s;&s;e Po&euml;tis</L>
<L>Non homines, non Di, non conce&s;&s;&ecirc;re columnae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q><L>For God and Man, and lettered po&s;t denies,</L>
<L>That Poets ever are of middling &s;ize.</L><BIBL>FRANCIS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</L></Q>
In Eloquence this does not hold. There, one may po&s;&s;e&s;s a moderate &s;tation with dignity. Eloquence admits of a great many different forms; plain and &s;imple, as well as high and pathetic; and a Genius that cannot reach the latter, may &s;hine with much reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s in the former.</P>
<P>WHETHER Nature or Art contribute mo&s;t to form an Orator, is a trifling enquiry. In all attainments whatever, Nature mu&s;t be the prime agent. She mu&s;t be&s;tow the ori|ginal talents. She mu&s;t &s;ow the &s;eeds; but culture is requi&s;ite for bringing tho&s;e &s;eeds to perfection. Nature mu&s;t always have done &s;omewhat; but a great deal will always be left to be done by Art. This is certain, that &s;tudy and di&s;cipline are more nece&s;&s;ary for the improvement of natural genius, in Oratory, than they are in Poetry. What I mean is, that though Poetry be capable of receiving a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Critical Art, yet a Poet, with|out any aid from Art, by the force of genius alone, can ri&s;e higher than a Public Speaker
<PB N="4" REF="7">
can do, who has never given attention to the rules of Style, Compo&s;ition, and Delivery. Homer formed him&s;elf; Demo&s;thenes and Cicero were formed by the help of much la|bour, and of many a&s;&s;i&s;tances derived from the labour of others. After the&s;e preliminary ob&s;ervations, let us proceed to the main de|&s;ign of this Lecture; to con&s;ider of the means to be u&s;ed for Improvement in Elo|quence.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, What &s;tands highe&s;t in the order of means, is per&s;onal character and di&s;po&s;ition. In order to be a truly eloquent or per&s;ua&s;ive Speaker, nothing is more ne|ce&s;&s;ary than to be a virtuous man. This was a favourite po&s;ition among the ancient Rhe|toricians: <Q REND="inline">"Non po&s;&s;e Oratorem e&s;&s;e ni&s;i virum bonum."</Q> To find any &s;uch connec|tion between virtue and one of the highe&s;t liberal arts, mu&s;t give plea&s;ure; and it can, I think, be clearly &s;hown, that this is not a mere topic of declamation, but that the con|nection here alleged, is undoubtedly founded in truth and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>FOR, con&s;ider fir&s;t, Whether any thing be more e&s;&s;ential to per&s;ua&s;ion, than the opinion which we entertain of the probity, di&s;inter|e&s;tedne&s;s, candour, and other good moral qualities of the per&s;on who endeavours to per&s;uade? The&s;e give weight and force to every thing which he utters; nay, they add a beauty to it; they di&s;po&s;e us to li&s;ten with
<PB N="5" REF="8">
attention and plea&s;ure; and create a &s;ecret partiality in favour of that &s;ide which he e&s;pou&s;es. Whereas, if we entertain a &s;u&s;|picion of craft and di&s;ingenuity, of a corrupt, or a ba&s;e mind, in the Speaker, his Eloquence lo&s;es all its real effect. It may entertain and amu&s;e; but it is viewed as artifice, as trick, as the play only of &s;peech; and, viewed in this light, Whom can it per&s;uade? We even read a book with more plea&s;ure, when we think favourably of its Author; but when we have the living Speaker before our eyes, addre&s;&s;ing us per&s;onally on &s;ome &s;ubject of importance, the opinion we entertain of his character mu&s;t have a much more powerful effect.</P>
<P>BUT, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;aid, that this relates only to the character of Virtue, which one may maintain, without being at bottom a truly worthy man, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve farther, that, be&s;ides the weight which it adds to Cha|racter, real Virtue operates al&s;o, in other ways, to the advantage of Eloquence.</P>
<P>FIRST, Nothing is &s;o favourable as Virtue to the pro&s;ecution of honourable &s;tudies. It prompts a generous emulation to excel; it inures to indu&s;try; it leaves the mind vacant and free, ma&s;ter of it&s;elf, di&s;encumbered of tho&s;e bad pa&s;&s;ions, and di&s;engaged from tho&s;e mean pur&s;uits, which have ever been found the greate&s;t enemies to true proficiency. Quinctilian has touched this con&s;ideration
<PB N="6" REF="9">
very properly: <Q REND="inline">"Quod &s;i agrorum nimia cura, et &s;ollicitior rei familiaris diligentia, et venandi voluptas, &amp; dati &s;pectaculis dies, multum &s;tudiis auferunt, quid putamus fac|turas cupiditatem, avaritiam, invidiam? Nihil enim e&s;t tam occupatum, tam multi|forme, tot ac tam variis affectibus conci&s;um, atque laceratum, quam mala ac improba mens. Quis inter haec, literis, aut ulli bonae arti, locus? Non hercle magis quam frugibus, in terra &s;entibus ac rubis occu|pata<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"If the management of an e&s;tate, if anxious attention to dome&s;tic oeconomy, a pa&s;&s;ion for hunting, or whole days given up to public places and amu&s;ements, con&s;ume &s;o much time that is due to &s;tudy, how much greater wa&s;te mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by licentious de&s;ires, avarice, or envy? Nothing is &s;o much hurried and agitated, &s;o con|tradictory to it&s;elf, or &s;o violently torn and &s;hattered by conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, as a bad heart. Amid&s;t the di&s;trac|tions which it produces, what room is left for the culti|vation of letters, or the pur&s;uit of any honourable art? No more, a&s;&s;uredly, than there is for the growth of corn in a field that is overrun with thorns and brambles."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, there is another of &s;till higher importance, though I am not &s;ure of its being attended to as much as it de&s;erves; namely, that from the foun|tain of real and genuine virtue, are drawn tho&s;e &s;entiments which will ever be mo&s;t powerful in affecting the hearts of others. Bad as the world is, nothing has &s;o great and univer&s;al a command over the minds of men as virtue. No kind of Language is &s;o gene|rally under&s;tood, and &s;o powerfully felt, as
<PB N="7" REF="10">
the native Language of worthy and virtuous feelings. He only, therefore, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e full and &s;trong, can &s;peak properly, and in its own language, to the heart. On all great &s;ubjects and occa&s;ions, there is a dig|nity, there is an energy in noble &s;entiments, which is overcoming and irre&s;i&s;tible. They give an ardour and a flame to one's Di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;eldom fails to kindle a like flame in tho&s;e who hear; and which, more than any other cau&s;e, be&s;tows on Eloquence that pow|er, for which it is famed, of &s;eizing and tran&s;porting an Audience. Here, Art and Imitation will not avail. An a&s;&s;umed cha|racter conveys nothing of this powerful warmth. It is only a native and unaffected glow of feeling, which can tran&s;mit the emo|tion to others. Hence, the mo&s;t renowned Orators, &s;uch as Cicero and Demo&s;thenes, were no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;ome of the high virtues, as Public Spirit and zeal for their country, than for Eloquence. Beyond doubt, to the&s;e virtues their Eloquence owed much of its effect; and tho&s;e Orations of theirs, in which there breathes mo&s;t of the virtuous and magnanimous &s;pirit, are tho&s;e which have mo&s;t attracted the admiration of ages.</P>
<P>NOTHING, therefore, is more nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who would excel in any of the higher kinds of Oratory, than to cultivate habits of the &s;everal virtues, and to refine and improve all their moral feelings. Whenever the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="11">
become dead, or callous, they may be a&s;&s;ured, that, on every great occa&s;ion, they will &s;peak with le&s;s power, and le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;itions, particularly re|qui&s;ite for them to cultivate, are the follow|ing: The love of ju&s;tice and order, and in|dignation at in&s;olence and oppre&s;&s;ion; the love of hone&s;ty and truth, and dete&s;tation of fraud, meanne&s;s, and corruption; magnani|mity of &s;pirit; the love of liberty, of their country and the public; zeal for all great and noble de&s;igns, and reverence for all wor|thy and heroic characters. A cold and &s;cep|tical turn of mind is extremely adver&s;e to Eloquence; and no le&s;s &s;o, is that cavilling di&s;po&s;ition which takes plea&s;ure in depreciat|ing what is great, and ridiculing what is generally admired. Such a di&s;po&s;ition be|&s;peaks one not very likely to excel in any thing; but lea&s;t of all in Oratory. A true Orator &s;hould be a per&s;on of generous &s;enti|ments, of warm feelings, and of a mind turned towards the admiration of all tho&s;e great and high objects, which mankind are naturally formed to admire. Joined with the manly virtues, he &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;trong and tender &s;en&s;iblity to all the injuries, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;orrows of his fellow-creatures; a heart that can ea&s;ily re|lent; that can readily enter into the circum|&s;tances of others, and can make their ca&s;e his own. A proper mixture of courage, and of mode&s;ty, mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;tudied by every Public Speaker. Mode&s;ty is e&s;&s;ential; it is
<PB N="9" REF="12">
always, and ju&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;ed, to be a con|comitant of merit; and every appearance of it is winning and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. But mo|de&s;ty ought not to run into exce&s;&s;ive timidity. Every Public Speaker &s;hould be able to re&s;t &s;omewhat on him&s;elf; and to a&s;&s;ume that air, not of &s;elf-complacency, but of firmne&s;s, which be&s;peaks a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his being thoroughly per&s;uaded of the truth, or ju&s;tice, of what he delivers; a circum&s;tance of no &s;mall con&s;equence for making impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who hear.</P>
<P>NEXT to moral qualifications, what, in the &s;econd place, is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to an Ora|tor, is a fund of knowledge. Much is this inculcated by Cicero and Quinctilian: <Q REND="inline">"Quod omnibus di&s;ciplinis et artibus debet e&s;&s;e in|&s;tructus Orator."</Q> By which they mean, that he ought to have what we call, a Liberal Education; and to be formed by a regular &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and the polite arts. We mu&s;t never forget that,
<Q><L>Scribendi recte, &s;apere e&s;t &amp; principium &amp; &s;ons.</L></Q>
Good &s;en&s;e and knowledge, are the founda|tion of all good &s;peaking. There is no art that can teach one to be eloquent, in any &s;phere, without a &s;ufficient acquaintance with what belongs to that &s;phere; or if there were an Art that made &s;uch preten&s;ions, it would be mere quackery, like the preten&s;i|ons of the Sophi&s;ts of old, to teach their di&s;|ciples
<PB N="10" REF="13">
to &s;peak for and again&s;t every &s;ubject; and would be de&s;ervedly exploded by all wi&s;e men. Attention to Style, to Compo&s;ition, and all the Arts of Speech, can only a&s;&s;i&s;t an Orator in &s;etting off, to advantage, the &s;tock of materials which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; but the &s;tock, the materials them&s;elves, mu&s;t be brought from other quarters than from Rhe|toric. He who is to plead at the Bar, mu&s;t make him&s;elf thoroughly ma&s;ter of the know|ledge of the Law; of all the learning and experience that can be u&s;eful in his profe&s;|&s;ion, for &s;upporting a cau&s;e, or convincing a Judge. He who is to &s;peak from the Pulpit, mu&s;t apply him&s;elf clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of di|vinity, of practical religion, of morals, of human nature; that he may be rich in all the topics, both of in&s;truction and of per&s;ua|&s;ion. He who would fit him&s;elf for being a Member of the Supreme Council of the Na|tion, or of any Public A&s;&s;embly, mu&s;t be thoroughly acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s that belongs to &s;uch A&s;&s;embly; he mu&s;t &s;tudy the forms of Court, the cour&s;e of procedure; and mu&s;t attend minutely to all the facts that may be the &s;ubject of que&s;tion or deli|beration.</P>
<P>BESIDES the knowledge that properly be|longs to that profe&s;&s;ion to which he addicts him&s;elf, a Public Speaker, if ever he expects to be eminent, mu&s;t make him&s;elf acquainted, as far as his nece&s;&s;ary occupations allow, with the general circle of polite literature.
<PB N="11" REF="14">
The &s;tudy of Poetry may be u&s;eful to him, on many occa&s;ions, for embelli&s;hing his Style, for &s;ugge&s;ting lively images, or agreeable al|lu&s;ions. The &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory may be &s;till more u&s;eful to him; as the knowledge of facts, of eminent characters, and of the cour&s;e of human affairs, finds place on many occa|&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"Imprimis ver&ograve;, abundare debet Orator exemplorum copia, cum veterum, tum etiam novorum; adeo ut non modo quae con&s;cripta &s;unt hi&s;toriis, aut Sermonibus velut per manus tradita, quaeque quotidie aguntur, debeat n&ocirc;&s;&s;e; ver&ugrave;m ne ea quidem quae a clarioribus po&euml;tis &s;unt ficta negligere." <BIBL>QUINCT. L. xii. Cap. 4.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. There are few great occa&s;ions of Public Speaking, in which one will not de|rive a&s;&s;i&s;tance from cultivated ta&s;te, and ex|ten&s;ive knowledge. They will often yield him materials for proper ornament; &s;ome|times, for argument and real u&s;e. A defici|ency of knowledge, even in &s;ubjects that belong not directly to his own profe&s;&s;ion, will expo&s;e him to many di&s;advantages, and give better qualified rivals a great &s;uperiority over him.</P>
<P>ALLOW me to recommend, in the third place, not only the attainment of u&s;eful know|ledge, but a habit of application and indu&s;try. Without this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to excel in any thing. We mu&s;t not imagine, that it is by a &s;ort of mu&s;hroom growth, that one can ri&s;e to be a di&s;tingui&s;hed Pleader, or Preacher, or Speaker in any A&s;&s;embly. It is not by &s;tarts of application, or by a few years preparation
<PB N="12" REF="15">
of &s;tudy afterwards di&s;continued, that emi|nence can be attained. No; it can be attain|ed only by means of regular indu&s;try, grown up into a habit, and ready to be exerted on every occa&s;ion that calls for indu&s;try. This is the fixed law of our nature; and he mu&s;t have a very high opinion of his own genius indeed, that can believe him&s;elf an exception to it. A very wi&s;e law of our nature it is; for indu&s;try is, in truth, the great <Q REND="inline">"Condimen|tum,"</Q> the &s;ea&s;oning of every plea&s;ure; with|out which life is doomed to langui&s;h. No|thing is &s;o great an enemy both to honourable attainments, and to the real, to the bri&s;k, and &s;pirited enjoyment of life, as that relaxed &s;tate of mind which ari&s;es from indolence and di&s;&s;i|pation. One that is de&s;tined to excel in any art, e&s;pecially in the arts of Speaking and Writing, will be known by this more than by any other mark whatever, an enthu&s;ia&s;m for that art; an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, firing his mind with the object he has in view, will di&s;po&s;e him to reli&s;h every labour which the means require. It was this, that characteri&s;ed the great men of antiquity; it is this, which mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the Moderns who would tread in their &s;teps. This honourable enthu|&s;ia&s;m, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch as are &s;tudying Oratory to cultivate. If youth wants it, manhood will flag mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, attention to the be&s;t models will contribute greatly towards im|provement. Every one who &s;peaks, or
<PB N="13" REF="16">
writes, &s;hould, indeed, endeavour to have &s;omewhat that is his own, that is peculiar to him&s;elf, and that characteri&s;es his Compo&s;ition and Style. Slavi&s;h Imitation depre&s;&s;es Genius, or rather betrays the want of it. But withal, there is no Genius &s;o original, but may be profited and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the aid of proper ex|amples, in Style, Compo&s;ition, and Delivery. They always open &s;ome new ideas; they &s;erve to enlarge and correct our own. They quicken the current of thought, and excite emula|tion.</P>
<P>MUCH, indeed, will depend upon the right choice of models which we purpo&s;e to imitate; and &s;uppo&s;ing them rightly cho&s;en, a farther care is requi&s;ite, of not being &s;educed by a blind univer&s;al admiration. For, <Q REND="inline">"decipit exemplar, vitiis imitabile."</Q> Even in the mo&s;t fini&s;hed models we can &s;elect, it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that there are always &s;ome things improper for imitation. We &s;hould &s;tudy to acquire a ju&s;t conception of the pecu|liar characteri&s;tic beauties of any Writer, or Public Speaker, and imitate the&s;e only. One ought never to attach him&s;elf too clo&s;ely to any &s;ingle model; for he who does &s;o, is almo&s;t &s;ure of being &s;educed into a faulty and affected imitation. His bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be, to draw from &s;everal the proper ideas of perfec|tion. Living examples of Public Speaking, in any kind, it will not be expected that I &s;hould here point out. As to the Writers antient and modern, from whom benefit may
<PB N="14" REF="17">
be derived in forming Compo&s;ition and Style, I have &s;poken &s;o much of them in former Lectures, that it is needle&s;s to repeat what I have &s;aid of their virtues and defects. I own, it is to be regretted, that the Engli&s;h Lan|guage, in which there is much good writing, furni&s;hes us, however, with but very few re|corded examples of eloquent public Speaking. Among the French there are more. Saurin, Bourdaloue, Flechier, Ma&s;&s;illon, particularly the la&s;t, are eminent for the Eloquence of the Pulpit. But the mo&s;t nervous and &s;ublime of all their Orators is Bo&s;&s;uet, the famous Bi&s;hop of Meaux; in who&s;e <HI>Orai&s;ons Funebres,</HI> there is a very high &s;pirit of Oratory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The critici&s;m which Mr. Crevier, Author of Rheto|rique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e, pa&s;&s;es upon the&s;e Writers whom I have abovenamed, is: <Q REND="inline">"Bo&s;&s;uet e&s;t grande, mais in&eacute;gal; Flechier e&s;t plus &eacute;gal, mais moins elev&eacute;, &amp; &s;ouvent trop fleuri: Bourdaloue e&s;t &s;olide &amp; judicieux, mais il neglige les graces leg&egrave;res: Ma&s;&s;illon e&s;t plus riche en images, mais moins fort en rai&s;onnement.

Some of Fontenelle's Harangues to the French Acade|my, are elegant and agreeable. And at the Bar, the printed Pleadings of Cochin and D'Ague&s;&s;eau, are highly extolled by the late French Critics.</P>
<P>THERE is one ob&s;ervation which it is of importance to make, concerning Imitation of the Style of any favourite Author, when we would carry his Style into Public Speaking.
<PB N="15" REF="18">
We mu&s;t attend to a very material di&s;tinction, between written and &s;poken Language. The&s;e are, in truth, two different manners of com|municating ideas. A Book that is to be read, requires one &s;ort of Style; a man that is to &s;peak, mu&s;t u&s;e another. In books, we look for correctne&s;s, preci&s;ion, all redundan|cies pruned, all repetitions avoided, Language completely poli&s;hed. Speaking admits a more ea&s;y copious Style, and le&s;s fettered by rule; repetitions may often be nece&s;&s;ary, pa|renthe&s;es may &s;ometimes be graceful, the &s;ame thought mu&s;t often be placed in diffe|rent views; as the hearers can catch it only from the mouth of the Speaker, and have not the advantage, as in reading a book, of turning back again, and of dwelling on what they do not fully comprehend. Hence the Style of many good authors, would appear &s;tiff, affected, and even ob&s;cure, if, by too clo&s;e an imitation, we &s;hould transfer it to a Popular Oration. How awkward, for ex|ample, would Lord Shaft&s;bury's Sentences &s;ound in the mouth of a Public Speaker? Some kinds of Public Di&s;cour&s;e, it is true, &s;uch as that of the Pulpit, where more exact preparation, and more &s;tudied Style are ad|mitted, would bear &s;uch a manner better than others, which are expected to approach more to extemporaneous &s;peaking. But &s;till there is, in general, &s;o much difference be|tween Speaking, and Compo&s;ition de&s;igned only to be read, as &s;hould guard us again&s;t a clo&s;e and injudicious imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">
SOME Authors there are, who&s;e manner of writing approaches nearer to the Style of Speaking than others; and who, therefore, can be imitated with more &s;afety. In this cla&s;s, among the Engli&s;h authors, are Dean Swift, and Lord Bolingbroke. The Dean, throughout all his writings, in the mid&s;t of much correctne&s;s, maintains the ea&s;y natural manner of an unaffected Speaker; and this is one of his chief excellencies. Lord Bo|lingbroke's Style is more &s;plendid, and more declamatory than Dean Swift's; but &s;till it is the Style of one who &s;peaks or rather who harangues. Indeed, all his Political Writings (for it is to them only, and not to his Philo|&s;ophical ones, that this ob&s;ervation can be applied) carry much more the appearance of one declaiming with warmth in a great A&s;&s;embly, than of one writing in a clo&s;et, in order to be read by others. They have all the copiou&s;ne&s;s, the fervour, the inculcating method that is allowable, and graceful in an Orator; perhaps too much of it for a Writer: and it is to be regretted, as I have formerly ob&s;erved, that the matter contained in them, &s;hould have been &s;o trivial or &s;o fal&s;e; for, from the manner and &s;tyle, con&s;iderable ad|vantage might be reaped.</P>
<P>IN the fifth place, be&s;ides attention to the be&s;t models, frequent exerci&s;e both in com|po&s;ing and &s;peaking, will be admitted to be a nece&s;&s;ary mean of improvement. That &s;ort of Compo&s;ition is, doubtle&s;s, mo&s;t u&s;eful,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
which relates to the profe&s;&s;ion, or kind of Public Speaking, to which per&s;ons addict them&s;elves. This, they &s;hould keep ever in their eye, and be gradually inuring them&s;elves to it. But let me al&s;o advi&s;e them, not to allow them&s;elves in negligent Compo&s;ition of any kind. He who has it for his aim to write, or to &s;peak correctly, &s;hould, in the mo&s;t trivial kind of Compo&s;ition, in Writing a Letter, nay, even in common Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;tudy to acquit him&s;elf with propriety. I do not at all mean, that he is never to write, or to &s;peak a word, but in elaborate and arti|ficial Language. This would form him to a &s;tiffne&s;s and affectation, wor&s;e, by ten thou|&s;and degrees, than the greate&s;t negligence. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that there is, in every thing, a manner which is becoming, and has propriety; and oppo&s;ite to it, there is a clum&s;y and faulty performance of the &s;ame thing. The becoming manner is very often the mo&s;t light, and &s;eemingly carele&s;s manner; but it requires ta&s;te and attention to &s;eize the ju&s;t idea of it. That idea, when acquired, we &s;hould keep in our eye, and form upon it whatever we write or &s;ay.</P>
<P>EXERCISES of &s;peaking have always been recommended to Students, in order that they may prepare them&s;elves for &s;peaking in pub|lic, and on real bu&s;ine&s;s. The meetings, or Societies, into which they &s;ometimes form them&s;elves for this purpo&s;e, are laudable in|&s;titutions; and, under proper conduct, may
<PB N="18" REF="21">
&s;erve many valuable purpo&s;es. They are fa|vourable to knowledge and &s;tudy, by giving occa&s;ion to enquiries, concerning tho&s;e &s;ub|jects which are made the ground of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. They produce emulation; and gradually inure tho&s;e who are concerned in them, to &s;omewhat that re&s;embles a Public A&s;&s;embly. They accu&s;tom them to know their own powers, and, to acquire a command of them|&s;elves in &s;peaking; and what is, perhaps, the greate&s;t advantage of all, they give them a facility and fluency of expre&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in procuring that <Q REND="inline">"Copia verborum,"</Q> which can be acquired by no other means but frequent exerci&s;e in &s;peaking.</P>
<P>BUT the meetings which I have now in my eye, are to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e acade|mical a&s;&s;ociations, where a moderate number of young Gentlemen, who are carrying on their &s;tudies, and are connected by &s;ome af|finity in the future pur&s;uits which they have in view, a&s;&s;emble privately, in order to im|prove one another, and to prepare them&s;elves for tho&s;e public exhibitions which may after|wards fall to their lot. As for tho&s;e public and promi&s;cuous Societies, in which multi|tudes are brought together, who are often of low &s;tations and occupations, who are joined by no common bond of union, except an ab|&s;urd rage for Public Speaking, and have no other object in view, but to make a &s;how of their &s;uppo&s;ed talents, they are in&s;titutions not merely of an u&s;ele&s;s, but of an hurtful
<PB N="19" REF="22">
nature. They are in great hazard of proving &s;eminaries of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, petulance, fac|tion, and folly. They mi&s;lead tho&s;e who, in their own callings, might be u&s;eful mem|bers of &s;ociety, into fanta&s;tic plans of mak|ing a figure on &s;ubjects, which divert their attention from their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and are widely remote from their &s;phere in life.</P>
<P>EVEN the allowable meetings into which Students of Oratory form them&s;elves, &s;tand in need of direction in order to render them u&s;eful. If their &s;ubjects of Di&s;cour&s;e be im|properly cho&s;en; if they maintain extrava|gant or indecent topics; if they indulge them|&s;elves in loo&s;e and flim&s;y declamation, which has no foundation in good &s;en&s;e; or accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;peak pertly on all &s;ubjects without due preparation, they may improve one another in petulance, but in no other thing; and will infallibly form them&s;elves to a very faulty and vicious ta&s;te in &s;peaking. I would, therefore, advi&s;e all who are Mem|bers of &s;uch Societies, in the fir&s;t place, to attend to the choice of their &s;ubjects; that they be u&s;eful and manly, either formed on the cour&s;e of their &s;tudies, or on &s;omething that has relation to morals and ta&s;te, to action and life. In the &s;econd place, I would advi&s;e them to be temperate in the practice of Speaking; not to &s;peak too often, nor on &s;ubjects where they are ignorant or unripe; but only, when they have proper materials for a Di&s;cour&s;e, and have dige&s;ted and
<PB N="20" REF="23">
thought of the &s;ubject before-hand. In the third place, When they do &s;peak, they &s;hould &s;tudy always to keep good &s;en&s;e and per|&s;ua&s;ion in view, rather than an o&s;tentation of Eloquence; and for this end, I would, in the fourth place, repeat the advice which I gave in a former Lecture, that they &s;hould always choo&s;e that &s;ide of the que&s;tion to which, in their own judgment, they are mo&s;t inclined, as the right and the true &s;ide; and defend it by &s;uch arguments as &s;eem to them mo&s;t &s;olid. By the&s;e means, they will take the be&s;t method of forming them&s;elves gra|dually to a manly, correct, and per&s;ua&s;ive manner of Speaking.</P>
<P>IT now only remains to enquire, of what u&s;e may the &s;tudy of Critical and Rhetorical Writers be, for improving one in the practice of Eloquence? The&s;e are certainly not to be neglected; and yet, I dare not &s;ay that much is to be expected from them. For profe&s;&s;ed Writers on Public Speaking, we mu&s;t look chiefly among&s;t the antients. In modern times, for rea&s;ons which were before given, Popular Eloquence, as an Art, has never been very much the object of &s;tudy; it has not the &s;ame powerful effects now that it had in more democratical &s;tates; and there|fore has not been cultivated with the &s;ame care. Among the Moderns, though there has been a great deal of good critici&s;m on the different kinds of writing, yet much has not been attempted on the &s;ubject of Eloquence,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
or Public Di&s;cour&s;e; and what has been given us of that kind, has been drawn mo&s;tly from the Antients. Such a writer as Joannes Gerardus Vo&s;&s;ius, who has gathered into one heap of ponderous lumber, all the trifling, as well as the u&s;eful things, that are to be found in the Greek and Roman Writers, is enough to di&s;gu&s;t one with the &s;tudy of Elo|quence. Among the French, there has been more attempted, on this &s;ubject, than among the Engli&s;h. The Bi&s;hop of Cambray's Writings on Eloquence, I before mentioned with honour. Rollin, Batteaux, Crevier, Gibert, and &s;everal other French Critics, have al&s;o written on Oratory; but though &s;ome of them may be u&s;eful, none of them are &s;o con&s;iderable as to de&s;erve particular re|commendation.</P>
<P>IT is to the original Antient Writers that we mu&s;t chiefly have recour&s;e; and it is a reproach to any one, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion calls him to &s;peak in public, to be unacquainted with them. In all the Antient Rhetorical Writers, there is, indeed, this defect, that they are too &s;y&s;tematical, as I formerly &s;howed; they aim at doing too much; at re|ducing Rhetoric to a complete and perfect Art, which may even &s;upply invention with materials on every &s;ubject; in&s;omuch, that one would imagine they expected to form an Orator by rule, in as mechanical a manner as one would form a Carpenter. Whereas, all that can, in truth, be done, is to give open|ings
<PB N="22" REF="25">
for a&s;&s;i&s;ting and enlightening Ta&s;te, and for pointing out to Genius the cour&s;e it ought to hold.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE laid the foundation for all that was afterwards written on the &s;ubject. That amazing and comprehen&s;ive Genius, which does honour to human nature, and which gave light into &s;o many different Sci|ences, has inve&s;tigated the principles of Rhe|toric with great penetration. Ari&s;totle ap|pears to have been the fir&s;t who took Rheto|ric out of the hands of the Sophi&s;ts, and in|troduced rea&s;oning and good &s;en&s;e into the Art. Some of the profounde&s;t things which have been written on the pa&s;&s;ions and man|ners of men, are to be found in his Treati&s;e on Rhetoric; though in this, as in all his writings, his great brevity often renders him ob&s;cure. Succeeding Greek Rhetoricians, mo&s;t of whom are now lo&s;t, improved on the foundation which Ari&s;totle had laid. Two of them &s;till remain, Demetrius Phalereus, and Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us; both write on the Con&s;truction of Sentences, and de|&s;erve to be peru&s;ed; e&s;pecially Diony&s;ius, who is a very accurate and judicious Critic.</P>
<P>I NEED &s;carcely recommend the rhetorical writings of Cicero. Whatever, on the &s;ubject of Eloquence, comes from &s;o great an Orator, mu&s;t be worthy of attention. His mo&s;t con|&s;iderable work on this &s;ubject is that <HI>De Ora|tore,</HI> in three books. None of Cicero's writ|ings
<PB N="23" REF="26">
are more highly fini&s;hed than this Treati&s;e. The dialogue is polite; the cha|racters are well &s;upported, and the conduct of the whole is beautiful and agreeable. It is, indeed, full of digre&s;&s;ions, and his rules and ob&s;ervations may be thought &s;ometimes too vague and general. U&s;eful things, however, may be learned from it; and it is no &s;mall benefit to be made acquainted with Cicero's own idea of Eloquence. The "Orator ad M. Brutum," is al&s;o a con&s;iderable Trea|ti&s;e; and, in general, throughout all Cicero's rhetorical works there run tho&s;e high and &s;ublime ideas of Eloquence, which are fitted both for forming a ju&s;t ta&s;te, and for creating that enthu&s;ia&s;m for the Art, which is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence for excelling in it.</P>
<P>BUT, of all the Antient Writers on the &s;ubject of Oratory, the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, and mo&s;t u&s;eful, is Quinctilian. I know few books which abound more with good &s;en&s;e, and di&s;cover a greater degree of ju&s;t and accurate ta&s;te, than Quinctilian's In|&s;titutions. Almo&s;t all the principles of good Critici&s;m are to be found in them. He has dige&s;ted into excellent order all the antient ideas concerning Rhetoric, and is, at the &s;ame time, him&s;elf an eloquent Wri|ter. Though &s;ome parts of his work con|tain too much of the technical and artifi|cial &s;y&s;tem then in vogue, and for that rea|&s;on may be thought dry and tedious, yet I
<PB N="24" REF="27">
would not advi&s;e the omitting to read any part of his In&s;titutions. To Pleaders at the Bar, even the&s;e technical parts may prove of &s;ome u&s;e. Seldom has any per&s;on, of more &s;ound and di&s;tinct judgment than Quinctilian, applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Art of Ora|tory.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXV. COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE ANCI|ENTS AND THE MODERNS&mdash;HISTORI|CAL WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed that part of the Cour&s;e which re&s;pected Oratory, or Pub|lic Speaking, and which, as far as the &s;ubject allowed, I have endeavoured to form into &s;ome &s;ort of &s;y&s;tem. It remains, that I enter on the con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed kinds of Compo&s;ition both in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, and point out the principles of Critici&s;m relat|ing to them. This part of the work might ea&s;ily be drawn out to a great length; but I am &s;en&s;ible, that critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, when they are pur&s;ued too far, become both trifling and tedious. I &s;hall &s;tudy, therefore, to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary prolixity; and hope, at the &s;ame time, to omit nothing that is very material under the &s;everal heads.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">
I SHALL follow the &s;ame method here which I have all along pur&s;ued, and without which, the&s;e Lectures could not be entitled to any attention; that is, I &s;hall freely deli|ver my own opinion on every &s;ubject; re|garding authority no farther, than as it ap|pears to me founded on good &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on. In former Lectures, as I have often quoted &s;everal of the antient cla&s;&s;ics for their beau|ties, &s;o I have al&s;o, &s;ometimes, pointed out their defects. Hereafter, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to do the &s;ame, when treating of their writ|ings under more general heads. It may be fit, therefore, that, before proceeding farther, I make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the comparative merit of the Antients and the Moderns: in or|der that we may be able to a&s;certain rationally, upon what foundation that deference re&s;ts, which has &s;o generally been paid to the An|tients. The&s;e ob&s;ervations are the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as this &s;ubject has given ri&s;e to no &s;mall controver&s;y in the Republic of Letters; and they may, with propriety, be made now, as they will &s;erve to throw light on &s;ome things I have afterwards to deliver, concern|ing different kinds of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT is a remarkable phaenomenon, and one which has often employed the &s;peculations of curious men, that writers and arti&s;ts, mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their parts and Genius, have generally appeared in con&s;iderable numbers at a time. Some ages have been remarkably
<PB N="27" REF="30">
barren in them; while, at other periods, na|ture &s;eems to have exerted her&s;elf with a more than ordinary effort, and to have poured them forth with a profu&s;e fertility. Various rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned for this. Some of the moral cau&s;es lie obvious; &s;uch as favourable circum&s;tances of government and of manners; encouragement from great men; emulation excited among the men of Genius. But as the&s;e have been thought inadequate to the whole effect, phy&s;ical cau&s;es have been al&s;o a&s;&s;igned; and the Abb&eacute; du Bos, in his Re|flections on Poetry and Painting, has collected a great many ob&s;ervations on the influence which the air, the climate, and other &s;uch natural cau&s;es, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have upon genius. But whatever the cau&s;es be, the fact is certain, that there have been certain peri|ods or ages of the world much more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed than others, for the extraordinary productions of genius.</P>
<P>LEARNED men have marked out four of the&s;e happy Ages. The fir&s;t is the Grecian Age, which commenced near the time of the Peloponne&s;ian war, and extended till the time of Alexander the Great; within which period, we have Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Socrates, Plato, Ari&s;totle, De|mo&s;thenes, Ae&s;chines, Ly&s;ias, I&s;ocrates, Pin|dar, Ae&s;chylus, Euripides, Sophocles, Ari&s;to|phanes, Menander, Anacreon, Theocritus, Ly&s;ippus, Apelles, Phidias, Praxiteles. The &s;econd, is the Roman Age, included nearly within the days of Julius Cae&s;ar and Augu&s;|tus;
<PB N="28" REF="31">
affording us Catullus, Lucretius, Te|rence, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Phaedrus, Cae&s;ar, Cicero, Livy, Sallu&s;t, Varro, and Vitruvius. The third Age is, that of the re&s;toration of Learning, under the Popes Julius II. and Leo X.; when flouri&s;hed Ario&s;to, Ta&s;&s;o, Sannazarius, Vida, Machiavel, Guic|ciardini, Davila, Era&s;mus, Paul Jovius, Mi|chael Angelo, Raphael, Titian. The fourth, comprehends the Age of Louis the XIV. and Queen Anne, when flouri&s;hed in France, Cor|neille, Racine, De Retz, Moliere, Boileau, Fontaine, Bapti&s;te, Rou&s;&s;eau, Bo&s;&s;uet, Fe|nelon, Bourdaloue, Pa&s;call, Malebranche, Ma&s;&s;illon, Bruyere, Bayle, Fontenelle, Ver|tot; and in England, Dryden, Pope, Addi|&s;on, Prior, Swift, Parnell, Congreve, Otway, Young, Rowe, Atterbury, Shaft&s;bury, Bo|lingbroke, Tillot&s;on, Temple, Boyle, Locke, Newton, Clark.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;peak comparatively of the An|cients and the Moderns, we generally mean by the Ancients, &s;uch as lived in the two fir&s;t of the&s;e periods, including al&s;o one or two who lived more early, as Homer in par|ticular; and by the Moderns, tho&s;e who flou|ri&s;hed in the two la&s;t of the&s;e ages, including al&s;o the eminent Writers down to our own times. Any compari&s;on between the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of Writers, cannot be other than vague and loo&s;e, as they comprehend &s;o many, and of &s;uch different kinds and degrees of genius. But the compari&s;on is generally made to turn,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
by tho&s;e who are fond of making it, upon two or three of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in each cla&s;s. With much heat it was agitated in France, between Boileau and Mad. Dacier, on the one hand, for the Ancients, and Per|rault and La Motte, on the other, for the Moderns; and it was carried to extremes on both &s;ides. To this day, among men of ta&s;te and letters, we find a learning to one or other &s;ide. A few reflections may throw light up|on the &s;ubject, and enable us to di&s;cern upon what grounds we are to re&s;t our judgment in this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IF any one, at this day, in the eighteenth century, takes upon him to decry the ancient cla&s;&s;ics; if he pretends to have di&s;covered that Homer and Virgil are Poets of incon&s;i|derable merit, and that Demo&s;thenes and Ci|cero are not great Orators, we may boldly venture to tell &s;uch a man, that he is come too late with his di&s;covery. The reputa|tion of &s;uch Writers is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a foundation too &s;olid, to be now &s;haken by any arguments whatever; for it is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the almo&s;t univer&s;al ta&s;te of mankind, proved and tried throughout the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;o many ages. Imperfections in their works he may indeed point out; pa&s;&s;ages that are faulty he may &s;hew; for where is the human work that is perfect? But, if he attempts to di&s;credit their works in general, or to prove that the reputation which they have gained is, on the whole, unju&s;t, there is an
<PB N="30" REF="33">
argument again&s;t him, which is equal to full demon&s;tration. He mu&s;t be in the wrong; for human nature is again&s;t him. In matters of ta&s;te, &s;uch as Poetry and Oratory, to whom does the appeal lie? where is the &s;tandard? and where the authority of the la&s;t deci&s;ion? where is it to be looked for, but, as I formerly &s;hewed, in tho&s;e feelings and &s;entiments that are found, on the mo&s;t exten&s;ive examina|tion, to be the common &s;entiments and feel|ings of men? The&s;e have been fully con|&s;ulted on this head. The Public, the unpre|judiced Public, has been tried and appealed to for many centuries, and throughout al|mo&s;t all civilized nations. It has pronounced its verdict; it has given its &s;anction to tho&s;e writers; and from this Tribunal there lies no farther appeal.</P>
<P>IN matters of mere rea&s;oning, the world may be long in an error; and may be con|vinced of the error by &s;tronger rea&s;onings, when produced. Po&s;itions that depend upon &s;cience, upon knowledge, and matters of fact, may be overturned according as &s;cience and knowledge are enlarged, and new mat|ters of fact are brought to light. For this rea&s;on, a &s;y&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy receives no &s;ufficient &s;anction from its antiquity, or long currency. The world, as it grows older, may be ju&s;tly expected to become, if not wi&s;er, at lea&s;t more knowing; and &s;uppo&s;ing it doubtful whether Ari&s;totle, or Newton, were the greater genius, yet Newton's Phi|lo&s;ophy
<PB N="31" REF="34">
may prevail over Ari&s;totle's, by means of later di&s;coveries, to which Ari&s;totle was a &s;tranger. But nothing of this kind holds as to matters of ta&s;te; which depend not on the progre&s;s of knowledge and &s;cience, but upon &s;entiment and feeling. It is in vain to think of undeceiving mankind, with re|&s;pect to errors committed here, as in Phi|lo&s;ophy. For the univer&s;al feeling of man|kind is the natural feeling; and becau&s;e it is the natural, it is, for that rea&s;on, the right feeling. The reputation of the Iliad and the Aeneid mu&s;t therefore &s;tand upon &s;ure ground, becau&s;e it has &s;tood &s;o long; though that of the Ari&s;totelian or Platonic philo&s;o|phy, every one is at liberty to call in que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>IT is in vain al&s;o to allege, that the repu|tation of the Ancient Poets, and Orators, is owing to authority, to pedantry, and to the prejudices of education, tran&s;mitted from age to age. The&s;e, it is true, are the Au|thors put into our hands at &s;chools and col|leges, and by that means we have now an early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in their favour; but how came they to gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of colleges and &s;chools? Plainly, by the high fame which the&s;e Authors had among their own cotemporaries. For the Greek and Latin were not always dead languages. There was a time, when Homer, and Virgil, and Ho|race, were viewed in the &s;ame light as we now view Dryden, Pope, and Addi&s;on. It
<PB N="32" REF="35">
is not to commentators and univer&s;ities, that the cla&s;&s;ics are indebted for their fame. They became cla&s;&s;ics and &s;chool-books, in con&s;equence of the high admiration which was paid them by the be&s;t judges in their own country and nation. As early as the days of Juvenal, who wrote under the reign of Domitian, we find Virgil and Horace be|come the &s;tandard books in the education of youth.<Q><L>Quot &s;tabant pueri, cum totus decolor e&s;&s;et</L>

<P>FROM this general principle, then, of the reputation of great ancient Cla&s;&s;ics being &s;o early, &s;o la&s;ting, &s;o univer&s;al, among all the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations, we may ju&s;tly and boldly infer that their reputation cannot be wholly unju&s;t, but mu&s;t have a &s;olid founda|tion in the merit of their writings.</P>
<P>LET us guard, however, again&s;t a blind and implicit veneration for the Ancients, in every thing. I have opened the general prin|ciple, which mu&s;t go far in in&s;tituting a fair compari&s;on between them and the Moderns. Whatever &s;uperiority the Ancients may have
<PB N="33" REF="36">
had in point of genius, yet in all arts, where the natural progre&s;s of knowledge has had room to produce any con&s;iderable effects, the Moderns cannot but have &s;ome advantage. The world may, in certain re&s;pects, be con|&s;idered as a per&s;on, who mu&s;t needs gain &s;omewhat by advancing in years. Its im|provements have not, I confe&s;s, been always in proportion to the centuries that have pa&s;&s;ed over it; for, during the cour&s;e of &s;ome ages, it has &s;unk as into a total lethargy. Yet, when rou&s;ed from that lethargy, it has ge|nerally been able to avail it&s;elf, more or le&s;s, of former di&s;coveries. At intervals, there aro&s;e &s;ome happy genius, who could both improve on what had gone before, and in|vent &s;omething new. With the advantage of a proper &s;tock of materials, an inferior genius can make greater progre&s;s, than a much &s;uperior one, to whom the&s;e materials are wanting.</P>
<P>HENCE, in Natural Philo&s;ophy, A&s;tro|nomy, Chemi&s;try, and other Sciences that de|pend on an exten&s;ive knowledge and ob&s;er|vation of facts, Modern Philo&s;ophers have an unque&s;tionable &s;uperiority over the An|cient. I am inclined al&s;o to think, that in matters of pure rea&s;oning, there is more pre|ci&s;ion among the Moderns, than in &s;ome in|&s;tances there was among the Ancients; ow|ing perhaps to a more exten&s;ive literary in|tercour&s;e, which has improved and &s;harpened the faculties of men. In &s;ome &s;tudies too,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
that relate to ta&s;te and fine writing, which is our object, the progre&s;s of Society mu&s;t, in equity, be admitted to have given us &s;ome advantages. For in&s;tance, in Hi&s;tory; there is certainly more political knowledge in &s;eve|ral European nations at pre&s;ent, than there was in ancient Greece and Rome. We are better acquainted with the nature of govern|ment, becau&s;e we have &s;een it under a greater variety of forms and revolutions. The world is more laid open than it was in former times; commerce is greatly enlarged; more countries are civilized; po&s;ts are every where e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; intercour&s;e is become more ea&s;y; and the knowledge of facts, by con&s;equence, more attainable. All the&s;e are great advan|tages to Hi&s;torians; of which, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, as I &s;hall afterward &s;hew, they have availed them&s;elves. In the more complex kinds of Poetry, likewi&s;e, we may have gained &s;omewhat, perhaps, in point of regu|larity and accuracy. In Dramatic Performan|ces, having the advantage of the ancient models, we may be allowed to have made &s;ome improvements, in the variety of the characters, the conduct of the plot, atten|tions to probability, and to decorums.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eem to me the chief points of &s;u|periority we can plead above the Ancients. Neither do they extend as far, as might be imagined at fir&s;t view. For if the &s;trength of genius be on one &s;ide, it will go far, in works of ta&s;te at lea&s;t, to counterbalance all
<PB N="35" REF="38">
the artificial improvements which can be made by greater knowledge and correctne&s;s. To return to our compari&s;on of the age of the world with that of a man; it may be &s;aid, not altogether without rea&s;on, that if the ad|vancing age of the world bring along with it more &s;cience and more refinement, there be|long, however, to its earlier periods, more vigour, more fire, more enthu&s;ia&s;m of genius. This appears indeed to form the characteri&s;|tical difference between the Ancient Poets, Orators, and Hi&s;torians, compared with the Modern. Among the Ancients, we find higher conceptions, greater &s;implicity, more original fancy. Among the moderns, &s;ome|times more art and correctne&s;s, but feebler exertions of genius. But, though this be in general a mark of di&s;tinction between the Ancients and Moderns, yet, like all general ob&s;ervations, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood with &s;ome exceptions; for in point of poetical fire and original genius, Milton and Shake&s;peare are inferior to no Poets in any age.</P>
<P>IT is proper to ob&s;erve, that there were &s;ome circum&s;tances in ancient times, very fa|vourable to tho&s;e uncommon efforts of genius which were then exerted. Learning was a much more rare and &s;ingular attainment in the earlier ages, than it is at pre&s;ent. It was not to &s;chools and univer&s;ities that the per&s;ons applied, who &s;ought to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves. They had not this ea&s;y recour&s;e. They travelled for their improvement into
<PB N="36" REF="39">
di&s;tant countries, to Egypt, and to the Ea&s;t. They enquired after all the monuments of learning there. They conver&s;ed with Prie&s;ts, Philo&s;ophers, Poets, with all who had ac|quired any di&s;tingui&s;hed fame. They return|ed to their own country full of the di&s;coveries which they had made, and fired by the new and uncommon objects which they had &s;een. Their knowledge and improvements co&s;t them more labour, rai&s;ed in them more enthu&s;ia&s;m, were attended with higher rewards and ho|nours, than in modern days. Fewer had the means and opportunities of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, than now; but &s;uch as did di&s;|tinqui&s;h them&s;elves, were &s;ure of acquiring that fame, and even veneration, which is, of all other rewards, the greate&s;t incentive to genius. Herodotus read his hi&s;tory to all Greece a&s;&s;embled at the Olympic games, and was publicly crowned. In the Peloponne&s;ian war, when the Athenian army was defeated in Sicily, and the pri&s;oners were ordered to be put to death, &s;uch of them as could repeat any ver&s;es of Euripides were &s;aved, from honour to that Poet, who was a citizen of Athens. The&s;e were te&s;timonies of public regard, far beyond what modern manners confer upon genius.</P>
<P>IN our times, good writing is con&s;idered as an attainment, neither &s;o difficult, nor &s;o high and meritorious.
<Q><PB N="37" REF="40">
<L>Scribimus indocti, doctique, Po&euml;mata pa&s;&s;im<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q><L>"Now every de&s;perate blockhead dares to write;</L>

We write much more &s;upinely, and at our ea&s;e, than the Ancients. To excel, is become a much le&s;s con&s;iderable object. Le&s;s effort, le&s;s exertion is required, becau&s;e we have many more in&s;tances than they. Printing has rendered all books common, and ea&s;y to be had. Education for any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions can be carried on without much trouble. Hence a mediocrity of genius is &s;pread over all. But to ri&s;e beyond that, and to overtop the crowd, is given to few. The multitude of a&s;&s;i&s;tances which we have for all kinds of compo&s;ition, in the opinion of Sir William Temple, a very competent judge, rather depre&s;&s;es, than favours, the exertions of native genius. <Q REND="inline">"It is very po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;ays that ingenious Author, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Ancients and Moderns, <Q REND="inline">"that men may lo&s;e rather than gain by the&s;e; may le&s;&s;en the force of their own genius, by forming it upon that of others; may have le&s;s know|ledge of their own, for contenting them|&s;elves with that of tho&s;e before them. So a man that only tran&s;lates, &s;hall never be a Poet; &s;o people that tru&s;t to others charity, rather than their own indu&s;try, will be always poor. Who can tell,"</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline">"whether learning may not even weaken
<PB N="38" REF="41">
invention, in a man that has great advan|tages from nature? Whether the weight and number of &s;o many other men's thoughts and notions may not &s;uppre&s;s his own; as heaping on wood &s;ometimes &s;up|pre&s;&s;es a little &s;park, that would otherwi&s;e have grown into a flame? The &s;trength of mind, as well as of body, grows more from the warmth of exerci&s;e, than of clothes; nay, too much of this foreign heat, rather makes men faint, and their con&s;titutions weaker than they would be without them."</Q></P>
<P>FROM whatever cau&s;e it happens, &s;o it is, that among &s;ome of the Ancient Writers, we mu&s;t look for the highe&s;t models in mo&s;t of the kinds of elegant Compo&s;ition. For accu|rate thinking and enlarged ideas, in &s;everal parts of Philo&s;ophy, to the Moderns we ought chiefly to have recour&s;e. Of correct and fini&s;hed writing in &s;ome works of ta&s;te, they may afford u&s;eful patterns; but for all that belongs to original genius, to &s;pirited, ma&s;terly, and high execution, our be&s;t and mo&s;t happy ideas are, generally &s;peaking, drawn from the Antients. In Epic Poetry, for in&s;tance, Homer and Virgil, to this day, &s;tand not within many degrees of any rival. Orators, &s;uch as Cicero and Demo&s;thenes, we have none. In hi&s;tory, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome defects, which I am afterwards to mention in the Ancient Hi&s;torical Plans, it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that we have no &s;uch hi&s;torical nar|ration,
<PB N="39" REF="42">
&s;o elegant, &s;o picture&s;que, &s;o animat|ed, and intere&s;ting as that of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Livy, Tacitus, and Sallu&s;t. Although the conduct of the drama may be admitted to have received &s;ome im|provements, yet for Poetry and Sentiment we have nothing to equal Sophocles and Euripi|des; nor any dialogue in Comedy, that comes up to the correct, graceful, and elegant &s;im|plicity of Terence. We have no &s;uch Love Elegies as tho&s;e of Tibullus; no &s;uch Pa&s;to|rals as &s;ome of Theocritus's: and for Lyric Poetry, Horace &s;tands quite unrivalled. The name of Horace cannot be mentioned without a particular encomium. That <Q REND="inline">"Curio&s;a Fe|licitas,"</Q> which Petronius has remarked in his expre&s;&s;ion; the &s;weetne&s;s, elegance, and &s;pi|rit of many of his Odes, the thorough know|ledge of the world, the excellent &s;entiments, and natural ea&s;y manner which di&s;tingui&s;h his Satyres and Epi&s;tles, all contribute to render him one of tho&s;e very few Authors whom one never tires of reading; and from whom alone, were every other monument de&s;troyed, we would be led to form a very high idea of the ta&s;te and genius of the Au|gu&s;tan Age.</P>
<P>TO all &s;uch then, as wi&s;h to form their ta&s;te, and nouri&s;h their genius, let me warm|ly recommend the a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy of the An|cient Cla&s;&s;ics, both Greek and Roman.
<Q><PB N="40" REF="43">

Without a con&s;iderable acquaintance with them, no man can be reckoned a polite &s;cho|lar; and he will want many a&s;&s;i&s;tances for writing and &s;peaking well, which the know|ledge of &s;uch Authors would afford him. Any one has great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect his own ta&s;te, who receives little or no plea&s;ure from the peru&s;al of writings, which &s;o many ages and nations have con&s;ented in holding up as ob|jects of admiration. And I am per&s;uaded, it will be found, that in proportion as the An|cients are generally &s;tudied and admired, or are unknown and di&s;regarded in any country, good ta&s;te and good compo&s;ition will flouri&s;h, or decline. They are commonly none but the ignorant or &s;uperficial, who underva|lue them.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, a ju&s;t and high regard for the prime writers of antiquity is to be always di&s;tingui&s;hed, from that contempt of every thing that is Modern, and that blind veneration for all that has been written in Greek or Latin, which belongs only to pe|dants. Among the Greek and Roman Au|thors, &s;ome a&s;&s;uredly de&s;erve much higher regard than others; nay, &s;ome are of no great value. Even the be&s;t of them lie open occa|&s;ionally to ju&s;t cen&s;ure; for to no human
<PB N="41" REF="44">
performance is it given, to be ab&s;olutely per|fect. We may, we ought therefore to read them with a di&s;tingui&s;hing eye, &s;o as to pro|po&s;e for imitation their beauties only; and it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;t and candid critici&s;m, to find fault with parts, while, at the &s;ame time, it admires the whole.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e reflections on the Ancients and Moderns, I proceed to a critical exami|nation of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed kinds of Compo&s;ition, and the Characters of tho&s;e Writers who have excelled in them, whether Modern or Ancient.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t general divi&s;ion of the different kinds of Compo&s;ition is, into tho&s;e written in Pro&s;e, and tho&s;e written in Ver&s;e; which certainly require to be &s;eparately con&s;idered, becau&s;e &s;ubject to &s;eparate laws. I begin, as is mo&s;t natural, with Writings in Pro&s;e. Of Orations, or Public Di&s;cour&s;es of all kinds, I have already treated fully. The remaining &s;pecies of Pro&s;e Compo&s;itions, which a&s;&s;ume any &s;uch regular form, as to fall under the cognizance of Critici&s;m, &s;eem to be chiefly the&s;e: Hi&s;torical Writing, Philo&s;ophical Wri|ting, Epi&s;tolary Writing, and Fictitious Hi&s;|tory. Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition &s;hall be fir&s;t con&s;idered; and, as it is an object of dignity, I purpo&s;e to treat of it at &s;ome length.</P>
<P>AS it is the office of an Orator to per&s;uade, it is that of an Hi&s;torian to record truth for the
<PB N="42" REF="45">
in&s;truction of mankind. This is the proper object and end of hi&s;tory, from which may be deduced many of the laws relating to it; and if this object were always kept in view, it would prevent many of the errors into which per&s;ons are apt to fall, concerning this &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition. As the primary end of Hi&s;tory is to record Truth, Impartiality, Fidelity, and Accuracy, are the fundamental qualities of an Hi&s;torian. He mu&s;t neither be a Panegyri&s;t, nor a Satyri&s;t. He mu&s;t not enter into faction, nor give &s;cope to affection: but, contemplating pa&s;t events and characters with a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate eye, mu&s;t pre|&s;ent to his Readers a faithful copy of human nature.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, it is not every record of facts, however true, that is entitled to the name of Hi&s;tory; but &s;uch a record as ena|bles us to apply the tran&s;actions of former ages for our own in&s;truction. The facts ought to be momentous and important; re|pre&s;ented in connection with their cau&s;es; traced to their effects; and unfolded in clear and di&s;tinct order. For wi&s;dom is the great end of hi&s;tory. It is de&s;igned to &s;upply the want of experience. Though it enforce not its in&s;tructions with the &s;ame authority, yet it furni&s;hes us with a greater variety of in&s;truc|tions, than it is po&s;&s;ible for experience to afford, in the cour&s;e of the longe&s;t life. Its object is, to enlarge our views of the human character, and to give full exerci&s;e to our
<PB N="43" REF="46">
judgment on human affairs. It mu&s;t not there|fore be a tale, calculated to plea&s;e only, and addre&s;&s;ed to the fancy. Gravity and dignity are e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tics of Hi&s;tory; no light ornaments are to be employed, no flip|pancy of &s;tyle, no quaintne&s;s of wit. But the writer mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain the character of a wi&s;e man, writing for the in&s;truction of po&s;|terity; one who has &s;tudied to inform him|&s;elf well, who has pondered his &s;ubject with care, and addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to our judgment, rather than to our imagination. Not that this is incon&s;i&s;tent with ornamented and &s;pi|rited narration. Hi&s;tory admits of much high ornament and elegance; but the ornaments mu&s;t be always con&s;i&s;tent with dignity; they &s;hould not appear to be &s;ought after; but to ri&s;e naturally from a mind animated by the events which it records.</P>
<P>HISTORICAL Compo&s;ition is under&s;tood to comprehend under it, Annals, Memoirs, Lives. But the&s;e are its inferior &s;ubordinate &s;pecies; on which I &s;hall hereafter make &s;ome reflections, when I &s;hall have fir&s;t con&s;idered what belongs to a regular and legitimate work of Hi&s;tory. Such a work is chiefly of two kinds. Either the entire hi&s;tory of &s;ome &s;tate or kingdom through its different revolutions, &s;uch as Livy's Roman Hi&s;tory; or the Hi&s;|tory of &s;ome one great event, or &s;ome por|tion or period of time which may be con&s;i|dered as making a whole by it&s;elf; &s;uch as, Thucydides's Hi&s;tory of the Peloponne&s;ian
<PB N="44" REF="47">
war, Davila's Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars of France, or Clarendon's of tho&s;e of Eng|land.</P>
<P>IN the conduct and management of his &s;ubject, the fir&s;t attention requi&s;ite in an Hi&s;|torian, is to give it as much unity as po&s;&s;ible; that is, his hi&s;tory &s;hould not con&s;i&s;t of &s;epa|rate unconnected parts merely, but &s;hould be bound together by &s;ome connecting principle, which &s;hall make the impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of &s;omething that is one, whole and entire. It is inconceivable how great effect this, when happily executed, has upon a Reader, and it is &s;urprizing that &s;ome able Writers of Hi&s;|tory have not attended to it more. Whether plea&s;ure or in&s;truction be the end &s;ought by the &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory, either of them is en|joyed to much greater advantage, when the mind has always before it the progre&s;s of &s;ome one great plan or &s;y&s;tem of actions; when there is &s;ome point or centre, to which we can refer the various facts related by the Hi&s;|torian.</P>
<P>IN general Hi&s;tories, which record the af|fairs of a whole nation or empire throughout &s;everal ages, this unity, I confe&s;s, mu&s;t be more imperfect. Yet even there, &s;ome de|gree of it can be pre&s;erved by a &s;kilful Writer. For though the whole, taken together, be very complex, yet the great con&s;tituent parts of it, form &s;o many &s;ubordinate wholes, when taken by them&s;elves; each of which
<PB N="45" REF="48">
can be treated both as complete within it&s;elf, and as connected with what goes before and follows. In the Hi&s;tory of a Monarchy, for in&s;tance, every reign &s;hould have its own unity; a beginning, a middle, and an end to the &s;y&s;tem of affairs; while, at the &s;ame time, we are taught to di&s;cern how that &s;y&s;|tem of affairs ro&s;e from the preceding, and how it is in&s;erted into what follows after. We &s;hould be able to trace all the &s;ecret links of the chain, which binds together remote, and &s;eemingly unconnected events. In &s;ome kingdoms of Europe, it was the plan of many &s;ucceeding princes to reduce the power of their nobles; and during &s;everal reigns, mo&s;t of the leading actions had a reference to this end. In other &s;tates, the ri&s;ing power of the Commons, influenced for a tract of time the cour&s;e and connection of public affairs. Among the Romans, the leading principle was a gradual extention of conque&s;t, and the attainment of univer&s;al empire. The conti|nual increa&s;e of their power, advancing to|wards this end from &s;mall beginnings, and by &s;ort of regular progre&s;&s;ive plan, furni&s;hed to Livy a happy &s;ubject for hi&s;torical unity, in the mid&s;t of a great variety of tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>OF all the ancient general Hi&s;torians, the one who had the mo&s;t exact idea of this quality of Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition, though, in other re&s;pects, not an elegant Writer, is Polybius. This appears from the account he gives of his own plan in the beginning of his Third Book;
<PB N="46" REF="49">
ob&s;erving that the &s;ubject of which he had undertaken to write, is, throughout the whole of it, one action, one great &s;pectacle; how, and by what cau&s;es, all the parts of the habi|table world became &s;ubject to the Roman Empire. <Q REND="inline">"This action,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"is di&s;tinct in its beginning, determined in its duration, and clear in its final accompli&s;hment; therefore, I think it of u&s;e, to give a gene|ral view beforehand, of the chief con&s;titu|ent parts which make up this whole."</Q> In another place, he congratulates him&s;elf on his good fortune, in having a &s;ubject for Hi&s;tory, which allowed &s;uch variety of parts to be united under one view; remarking, that be|fore this period, the affairs of the world were &s;cattered, and without connection; whereas, in the times of which he writes, all the great tran&s;actions of the world tended and verged to one point, and were capable of being con|&s;idered as parts of one &s;y&s;tem. Whereupon he adds &s;everal very judicious ob&s;ervations, concerning the u&s;efulne&s;s of writing Hi&s;tory upon &s;uch a comprehen&s;ive and connected plan; comparing the imperfect degree of knowledge, which is afforded by particular facts without general views, to the imperfect idea which one would entertain of an animal, who had beheld its &s;eparate parts only, with|out having ever &s;een its entire form and &s;tructure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">

SUCH as write the hi&s;tory of &s;ome particu|lar great tran&s;action, as confine them&s;elves to one aera, or one portion of the hi&s;tory of a nation, have &s;o great advantages for pre&s;erv|ing hi&s;torical unity, that they are inexcu&s;a|ble if they fail in it. Sallu&s;t's Hi&s;tories of the the Catilinarian and Jugurthine wars, Xeno|phon's Cyropoedia, and his Retreat of the Ten Thou&s;and, are in&s;tances of particular Hi&s;tories, where the unity of hi&s;torical object is perfectly well maintained.

THE Hi&s;torian mu&s;t not indeed neglect chronological order, with a view to render his narration agreeable. He mu&s;t give a di&s;|tinct account of the dates, and of the coin|cidence of facts. But he is not under the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking off always in the mid|dle of tran&s;actions, in order to inform us of what was happening el&s;ewhere at the &s;ame time. He di&s;covers no art, if he cannot form &s;ome connection among the affairs which he relates, &s;o as to introduce them in a proper train.

<P>THOUGH the hi&s;tory of Herodotus be of greater compa&s;s than that of Thucydides, and comprehend a much greater variety of di&s;&s;i|milar parts, he has been more fortunate in joining them together; and dige&s;ting them into order.

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXVI. HISTORICAL WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER making &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the controver&s;y which has been often carried on concerning the comparative merit of the Ancients and the Moderns, I entered, in the la&s;t Lecture, on the con&s;ideration of Hi&s;torical Writing. The general idea of Hi&s;tory is, a record of truth for the in&s;truc|tion of mankind. Hence ari&s;e the primary qualities required in a good Hi&s;torian, im|partiality, fidelity, gravity, and dignity. What I principally con&s;idered, was the unity which belongs to this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition; the na|ture of which I have endeavoured to explain.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next to ob&s;erve, that in order to fulfil the end of Hi&s;tory, the Author mu&s;t &s;tudy to trace to their &s;prings the actions and events which he records. Two things are e&s;|pecially nece&s;&s;ary for his doing this &s;ucce&s;s|fully;
<PB N="52" REF="55">
a thorough acquaintance with human nature, and political knowledge, or acquaint|ance with government. The former is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to account for the conduct of indivi|duals, and to give ju&s;t views of their cha|racter; the latter, to account for the revolu|tions of government, and the operation of political cau&s;es on public affairs. Both mu&s;t concur, in order to form a completely in&s;truc|tive Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the latter article, Politi|cal Knowledge, the Ancient Writers wanted &s;ome advantages which the Moderns enjoy; from whom, upon that account, we have a title to expect more accurate and preci&s;e in|formation. The world, as I formerly hinted, was more &s;hut up in ancient times, than it is now; there was then le&s;s communication among neighbouring &s;tates, and by con&s;e|quence le&s;s knowledge, of one another's af|fairs; no intercour&s;e by e&s;tabli&s;hed po&s;ts, or by Amba&s;&s;adors re&s;ident at di&s;tant courts. The knowledge, and materials of the Ancient Hi&s;torians, were thereby more limited and circum&s;cribed; and it is to be ob&s;erved too, that they wrote for their own countrymen only; they had no idea of writing for the in|&s;truction of foreigners, whom they de&s;pi&s;ed, or of the world in general; and hence, they are le&s;s attentive to convey all that know|ledge with regard to dome&s;tic policy, which we, in di&s;tant times, would de&s;ire to have learned from them. Perhaps al&s;o, though in
<PB N="53" REF="56">
ancient ages men were abundantly animated with the love of liberty, yet the full extent of the influence of government, and of po|litical cau&s;es, was not then &s;o thoroughly &s;crutinized, as it has been in modern times; when a longer experience of all the different modes of government has rendered men more enlightened and intelligent, with re&s;pect to public affairs.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e rea&s;ons it is owing, that though the Ancient Hi&s;torians &s;et before us the par|ticular facts which they relate, in a very di&s;|tinct and beautiful manner, yet &s;ometimes they do not give us a clear view of all the political cau&s;es, which affected the &s;ituation of affairs of which they treat. From the Greek Hi&s;torians, we are able to form but an imperfect notion, of the &s;trength, the wealth, and the revenues of the different Grecian &s;tates; of the cau&s;es of &s;everal of tho&s;e revolu|tions that happened in their government; or of their &s;eparate connections and interfering intere&s;ts. In writing the Hi&s;tory of the Ro|mans, Livy had &s;urely the mo&s;t ample field for di&s;playing political knowledge, concerning the ri&s;e of their greatne&s;s, and the advan|tages or defects of their government. Yet the in&s;truction in the&s;e important articles, which he affords, is not con&s;iderable. An elegant Writer he is, and a beautiful relater of facts, if ever there was one; but by no means di&s;tingui&s;hed for profoundne&s;s or pe|netration. Sallu&s;t, when writing the hi&s;tory
<PB N="54" REF="57">
of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government, which ought to have been altogether a Poli|tical Hi&s;tory, has evidently attended more to the elegance of narration, and the painting of characters, than to the unfolding of &s;ecret cau&s;es and &s;prings. In&s;tead of that complete information, which we would naturally have expected from him of the &s;tate of parties in Rome, and of that particular conjuncture of affairs, which enabled &s;o de&s;perate a profli|gate as Catiline to become &s;o formidable to government, he has given us little more than a general declamatory account of the luxury and corruption of manners in that age, com|pared with the &s;implicity of former times.</P>
<P>I BY no means, however, mean to cen&s;ure all the Ancient Hi&s;torians as defective in po|litical information. No Hi&s;torians can be more in&s;tructive than Thucydides, Polybius, and Tacitus. Thucydides is grave, intel|ligent, and judicious; always attentive to give very exact information concerning every operation which he relates; and to &s;hew the advantages or di&s;advantages of every plan that was propo&s;ed, and every mea&s;ure that was pur&s;ued. Polybius excels in comprehen|&s;ive political views, in penetration into great &s;y&s;tems, and in his profound and di&s;|tinct knowledge of all military affairs. Ta|citus is eminent for his knowledge of the hu|man heart; is &s;entimental and refined in a high degree; conveys much in&s;truction with
<PB N="55" REF="58">
re&s;pect to political matters, but more with re&s;pect to human nature.</P>
<P>BUT when we demand from the Hi&s;torian profound and in&s;tructive views of his &s;ubject, it is not meant that he &s;hould be frequently interrupting the cour&s;e of his Hi&s;tory, with his own reflections and &s;peculations. He &s;hould give us all the information that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our fully under&s;tanding the affairs which he records. He &s;hould make us ac|quainted with the political con&s;titution, the force, the revenues, the internal &s;tate of the country of which he writes; and with its intere&s;ts and connections in re&s;pect of neigh|bouring countries. He &s;hould place us, as on an elevated &s;tation, whence we may have an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of all the cau&s;es that co|operate in bringing forward the events which are related. But having put into our hands all the proper materials for judgment, he &s;hould not be too prodigal of his own opi|nions and rea&s;onings. When an Hi&s;torian is much given to di&s;&s;ertation, and is ready to philo&s;ophi&s;e and &s;peculate on all that he re|cords, a &s;u&s;picion naturally ari&s;es, that he will be in hazard of adapting his narrative of facts to favour &s;ome &s;y&s;tem which he has formed to him&s;elf. It is rather by fair and judicious narration that hi&s;tory &s;hould in&s;truct us, than by delivering in&s;truction in an avowed and direct manner. On &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions, when doubtful points require to be &s;crutinized, or when &s;ome great event is in
<PB N="56" REF="59">
agitation, concerning the cau&s;es or circum|&s;tances of which mankind have been much divided, the narrative may be allowed to &s;tand &s;till for a little; the Hi&s;torian may ap|pear, and may with propriety enter into &s;ome weighty di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But he mu&s;t take care not to cloy his Readers with &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, by repeating them too often.</P>
<P>WHEN ob&s;ervations are to be made concern|ing human nature in general, or the peculiari|ties of certain characters, if the Hi&s;torian can artfully incorporate &s;uch ob&s;ervations with his narrative, they will have a better effect than when they are delivered as formal detached reflections. For in&s;tance; in the life of Agri|cola, Tacitus, &s;peaking of Domitian's treat|ment of Agricola, makes this ob&s;ervation: <Q REND="inline">"Proprium humani ingenii e&s;t, odi&s;&s;e quem lae&s;eris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"It belongs to human nature, to hate the man whom you have injured."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t and well applied; but the form in which it &s;tands, is ab&s;tract and philo&s;ophical. A thought of the &s;ame kind has a finer effect el&s;ewhere in the &s;ame Hi&s;torian, when &s;peaking of the jealou&s;ies which Germanicus knew to be en|tertained again&s;t him by Livia and Tiberius: <Q REND="inline">"Anxius,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"occultis in &s;e patrui aviaeque odiis, quorum cau&s;ae acriores quia iniquae<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"Unea&s;y in his mind, on account of the concealed ha|tred entertained again&s;t him by his uncle and grandmo|ther, which was the more bitter, becau&s;e the cau&s;e of it was unju&s;t."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Here a profound moral ob&s;er|vation
<PB N="57" REF="60">
is made; but it is made, without ap|pearing to make it in form; it is introduced as a part of the narration, in a&s;&s;igning a rea|&s;on for the anxiety of Germanicus. We have another in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind, in the account which he gives of a mutiny rai&s;ed again&s;t Rufus, who was a <Q REND="inline">"Praefectus Ca&s;|trorum,"</Q> on account of the &s;evere labour which he impo&s;ed on the &s;oldiers. <Q REND="inline">"Quippe Rufus, diu manipularis, dein centurio, mox ca&s;tris praefectus, antiquam duramque mili|tiam revocabat, vetus operis &amp; laboris, et eo immitior quia toleraverat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"For Rufus, who had long been a common &s;oldier, afterwards a Centurion, and at length a general officer, re&s;tored the &s;evere military di&s;cipline of ancient times. Grown old amid&s;t toils and labours, he was the more rigid in impo&s;ing them, becau&s;e he had been accu&s;tomed to bear them."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> There was room for turning this into a general ob&s;erva|tion, that they who have been educated and hardened in toils, are commonly found to be the mo&s;t &s;evere in requiring the like toils from others. But the manner in which Tacitus introduces this &s;entiment, as a &s;troke in the character of Rufus, gives it much more life and &s;pirit. This Hi&s;torian has a particular talent of intermixing after this manner with the cour&s;e of his narrative, many &s;triking &s;entiments and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>LET us next proceed to con&s;ider the proper qualities of Hi&s;torical Narration. It is ob|vious, that on the manner of narration much
<PB N="58" REF="61">
mu&s;t depend, as the fir&s;t notion of Hi&s;tory is the recital of pa&s;t facts; and how much one mode of recital may be preferable to another we &s;hall &s;oon be convinced, by thinking of the different effects, which the &s;ame &s;tory, when told by two different per&s;ons, is found to produce.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t virtue of Hi&s;torical Narration, is Clearne&s;s, Order, and due Connection. To attain this, the Hi&s;torian mu&s;t be completely ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject; he mu&s;t &s;ee the whole as at one view; and comprehend the chain and dependence of all its parts, that he may introduce every thing in its proper place; that he may lead us &s;moothly along the track of affairs which are recorded, and may always give us the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing how one event ari&s;es out of another. Without this, there can be neither plea&s;ure nor in&s;truction, in reading Hi&s;tory. Much for this end will depend on the ob&s;ervance of that unity in the general plan and conduct, which, in the preceding Lecture, I recommended. Much too will depend on the proper management of tran&s;itions, which forms one of the chief ornaments of this kind of writing, and is one of the mo&s;t difficult in execution. No|thing tries an Hi&s;torian's abilities more, than &s;o to lay his train beforehand, as to make us pa&s;s naturally and agreeably from one part of his &s;ubject to another; to employ no clum|&s;y and awkward junctures; and to contrive ways and means of forming &s;ome union
<PB N="59" REF="62">
among tran&s;actions, which &s;eem to be mo&s;t widely &s;eparated from one another.</P>
<P>IN the next place, as Hi&s;tory is a very dignified &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition, gravity mu&s;t always be maintained in the narration. There mu&s;t be no meanne&s;s nor vulgarity in the &s;tyle; no quaint, nor colloquial phra&s;es; no affectation of pertne&s;s, or of wit. The &s;mart, or the &s;neering manner of telling a &s;tory, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the hi&s;torical cha|racter. I do not &s;ay, that an Hi&s;torian is never to let him&s;elf down. He may &s;ome|times do it with propriety, in order to diver|&s;ify the &s;train of his narration, which, if it be perfectly uniform, is apt to become tire|&s;ome. But he &s;hould be careful never to de|&s;cend too far; and, on occa&s;ions where a light or ludicrous anecdote is proper to be recorded, it is generally better to throw it into a note, than to hazard becoming too fa|miliar, by introducing it into the body of the work.</P>
<P>BUT an Hi&s;torian may po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e qua|lities of being per&s;picuous, di&s;tinct, and grave, and may notwith&s;tanding be a dull Writer; in which ca&s;e, we &s;hall reap little benefit from his labours. We will read him without plea&s;ure; or, mo&s;t probably, we &s;hall &s;oon give over to read him at all. He mu&s;t therefore &s;tudy to render his narration intere&s;ting; which is the quality that chief|ly
<PB N="60" REF="63">
di&s;tingui&s;hes a Writer of genius and elo|quence.</P>
<P>Two things are e&s;pecially conducive to this; the fir&s;t is, a ju&s;t medium in the con|duct of narration, between a rapid or crowd|ed recital of facts, and a prolix detail. The former embarra&s;&s;es, and the latter tires us. An Hi&s;torian that would intere&s;t us, mu&s;t know when to be conci&s;e, and where he ought to enlarge; pa&s;&s;ing conci&s;ely over &s;light and unimportant events but dwelling on &s;uch as are &s;triking and con&s;iderable in their na|ture, or pregnant with con&s;equences; pre|paring beforehand our attention to them, and bringing them forth into the mo&s;t full and con&s;picuous light. The next thing he mu&s;t attend to, is a proper &s;election of the circum|&s;tances belonging to tho&s;e events, which he choo&s;es to relate fully. General facts make a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. It is by means of circum&s;tances and particulars pro|perly cho&s;en, that a narration becomes in|tere&s;ting and affecting to the Reader. The&s;e give life, body, and colouring to the recital of facts, and enable us to behold them as pre&s;ent, and pa&s;&s;ing before our eyes. It is this employment of circum&s;tances, in Nar|ration, that is properly termed Hi&s;torical Painting.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e virtues of Narration, particu|larly in this la&s;t, of picture&s;que de&s;criptive Narration, &s;everal of the Antient Hi&s;torians
<PB N="61" REF="64">
eminently excel. Hence, the plea&s;ure that is found in reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Livy, Sallu&s;t, and Tacitus. They are all con&s;picuous for the Art of Narration. Herodotus is, at all times, an agreeable Writer, and relates every thing with that <HI>na&iuml;|vet&eacute;</HI> and &s;implicity of manner, which never fails to intere&s;t the Reader. Though the manner of Thucydides be more dry and har&s;h, yet, on great occa&s;ions, as when he is giving an account of the Plague of Athens, the Siege of Plataea, the Sedition in Corcyra, the Defeat of the Athenians in Sicily, he di&s;|plays a very &s;trong and ma&s;terly power of de&s;cription. Xenophon's Cyropaedia, and his Anaba&s;is, or retreat of the Ten Thou|&s;and, are extremely beautiful. The circum|&s;tances are finely &s;elected, and the Narration is ea&s;y and engaging; but his Hellenics, or Continuation of the Hi&s;tory of Thucydides, is a much inferior work. Sallu&s;t's Art of Hi&s;|torical Painting in his Catilinarian, but, more e&s;pecially, in his Jugurthine War, is well known; though his Style is liable to cen&s;ure, as too &s;tudied and affected.</P>
<P>LIVY is more unexceptionable in his man|ner; and is excelled by no Hi&s;torian whatever in the Art of Narration: &s;everal remarkable ex|amples might be given from him. His ac|count, for in&s;tance, of the famous defeat of the Roman army by the Samnites, at the Furcae Caudinae, in the beginning of the
<PB N="62" REF="65">
ninth book, affords one of the mo&s;t beautiful exemplifications of Hi&s;torical Painting, that is any where to be met with. We have fir&s;t, an exact de&s;cription of the narrow pa&s;s be|tween two mountains, into which the enemy had decoyed the Romans. When they find them&s;elves caught, and no hope of e&s;cape left, we are made to &s;ee, fir&s;t, their a&s;toni&s;h|ment, next, their indignation, and then, their dejection, painted in the mo&s;t lively manner, by &s;uch circum&s;tances and actions as were natural to per&s;ons in their &s;ituation. The re&s;tle&s;s and unquiet manner in which they pa&s;s the night; the con&s;ultations of the Sam|nites; the various mea&s;ures propo&s;ed to be taken; the me&s;&s;ages between the two armies, all heighten the &s;cene. At length, in the morning, the Con&s;uls return to the camp, and inform them that they could receive no other terms but that of &s;urrendering their arms, and pa&s;&s;ing under the yoke, which was con&s;idered as the la&s;t mark of ignominy for a conquered army. Part of what then follows, I &s;hall give in the Author's own words. <Q REND="inline">"Redintegravit luctum in ca&s;tris con&s;ulum adventus; ut vix ab iis ab&s;tinerent manus, quorum temeritate in eum locum deducti e&s;&s;ent.

They began to look on one another; to ca&s;t a melancholy eye on their arms, which were now to be &s;urrendered, and on their right hands, which were to become defencele&s;s.

TACITUS is another Author eminent for Hi&s;torical Painting, though in a manner alto|gether different from that of Livy. Livy's de&s;criptions are more full, more plain, and natural; tho&s;e of Tacitus con&s;i&s;t in a few bold &s;trokes. He &s;elects one or two remark|able circum&s;tances, and &s;ets them before us in a &s;trong, and, generally, in a new and uncommon light. Such is the following picture of the &s;ituation of Rome, and of the Emperor Galba, when Otho was advancing again&s;t him: <Q REND="inline">"Agebatur huc illuc Galba, vario turbae fluctuantis impul&s;u, completis undique ba&s;ilicis et templis, lugubri pro&s;|pectu. Neque populi aut plebis ulla vox; &s;ed attoniti vultus, et conver&s;ae ad omnia aures.

The temples and public buildings were filled with crowds, of a di&s;mal appearance. No clamours were heard, either from the citizens, or from the rabble. Their countenances were filled with con&s;ternation; their ears were employed in li&s;tening with anxiety. It was not a tumult; it was not quietne&s;s; it was the &s;ilence of terror, and of wrath."</Q></NOTE>".</Q> No image, in any Poet, is more &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive than this la&s;t &s;troke of the de&s;cription: <Q REND="inline">"Non tumultus, non quies, &s;ed quale," &amp;c.</Q> This is a conception of the &s;ublime kind, and di&s;covers high genius. In|deed, throughout all his work, Tacitus &s;hows the hand of a ma&s;ter. As he is profound in reflexion, &s;o he is &s;triking in de&s;cription, and
<PB N="66" REF="69">
pathetic in &s;entiment. The Philo&s;opher, the Poet, and the Hi&s;torian, all meet in him. Though the period of which he writes may be reckoned unfortunate for a Hi&s;torian, he has made it afford us many intere&s;ting ex|hibitions of human nature. The relations which he gives of the deaths of &s;everal emi|nent per&s;onages, are as affecting as the deepe&s;t tragedies. He paints with a glowing pencil; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, beyond all Writers, the talent of painting, not to the imagination merely, but to the heart. With many of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed beauties, he is, at the &s;ame time, not a perfect model for Hi&s;tory, and &s;uch as have formed them&s;elves upon him, have &s;el|dom been &s;ucce&s;sful. He is to be admired, rather than imitated. In his reflexions, he is too refined; in his &s;tyle, too conci&s;e, &s;ome|times quaint and affected, often abrupt and ob&s;cure. Hi&s;tory &s;eems to require a more natural, flowing, and popular manner.</P>
<P>THE Antients employed one embelli&s;h|ment of Hi&s;tory which the Moderns have laid a&s;ide, I mean Orations, which, on weighty occa&s;ions, they put into the mouths of &s;ome of their chief per&s;onages. By means of the&s;e, they diver&s;ified their hi&s;tory; they conveyed both moral and political in&s;truction; and, by the oppo&s;ite arguments which were employed, they gave us a view of the &s;enti|ments of different parties. Thucydides was the fir&s;t who introduced this method. The Orations with which his hi&s;tory abounds, and
<PB N="67" REF="70">
tho&s;e too of &s;ome other Greek and Latin Hi&s;torians, are among the mo&s;t valuable re|mains which we have of Antient Eloquence. How beautiful &s;oever they are, it may be much que&s;tioned, I think, whether they find a proper place in Hi&s;tory. I rather incline to think, that they are un&s;uitable to it. For they form a mixture which is unnatural in Hi&s;tory, of fixion with truth. We know, that the&s;e Orations are entirely of the Author's own compo&s;ition, and that he has introduced &s;ome celebrated per&s;on haranguing in a public place, purely that he might have an opportu|nity of &s;howing his own eloquence, or deli|vering his own &s;entiments, under the name of that per&s;on. This is a &s;ort of poetical liberty which does not &s;uit the gravity of Hi&s;tory, throughout which, an air of the &s;tricte&s;t truth &s;hould always reign. Orations may be an embelli&s;hment to Hi&s;tory; &s;uch might al&s;o Poetical Compo&s;itions be, introduced under the name of &s;ome of the per&s;onages mention|ed in the Narration, who were known to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed poetical talents. But neither the one, nor the other, find a proper place in Hi&s;tory. In&s;tead of in&s;erting formal Orations, the method adopted by later Writers, &s;eems better and more natural; that of the Hi&s;to|rian, on &s;ome great occa&s;ion, delivering, in his own per&s;on, the &s;entiments and rea&s;on|ings of the oppo&s;ite parties, or the &s;ub&s;tance of what was under&s;tood to be &s;poken in &s;ome Public A&s;&s;embly; which he may do without the liberty of fiction.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">
THE drawing of characters is one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid, and, at the &s;ame time, one of the mo&s;t difficult ornaments of Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition. For characters are generally con&s;idered, as profe&s;&s;ed exhibitions of fine writing; and an Hi&s;torian, who &s;eeks to &s;hine in them, is frequently in danger of carrying refinement to exce&s;s, from a de&s;ire of appear|ing very profound and penetrating. He brings together &s;o many contra&s;ts, and &s;ubtile oppo|&s;itions of qualities, that we are rather dazzled with &s;parkling expre&s;&s;ions, than entertained with any clear conception of a human charac|ter. A Writer who would characteri&s;e in an in&s;tructive and ma&s;terly manner, &s;hould be &s;imple in his &s;tyle, and &s;hould avoid all quaintne&s;s and affectation; at the &s;ame time, not contenting him&s;elf with giving us general outlines only, but de&s;cending into tho&s;e pe|culiarities which mark a character, in its mo&s;t &s;trong and di&s;tinctive features. The Greek Hi&s;torians &s;ometimes give elogiums, but rarely draw full and profe&s;&s;ed characters. The two Antient Authors who have laboured this part of Hi&s;torical compo&s;ition mo&s;t, are Sallu&s;t and Tacitus.</P>
<P>As Hi&s;tory is a &s;pecies of Writing de&s;igned for the in&s;truction of mankind, &s;ound mora|lity &s;hould always reign in it. Both in de|&s;cribing characters, and in relating tran&s;acti|ons, the Author &s;hould always &s;how him&s;elf to be on the &s;ide of virtue. To deliver moral in&s;truction in a formal manner, falls not
<PB N="69" REF="72">
within his province; but both as a good man, and as a good Writer, we expect, that he &s;hould di&s;cover &s;entiments of re&s;pect for virtue, and of indignation at flagrant vice. To appear neutral and indifferent with re|&s;pect to good and bad characters, and to affect a crafty and political, rather than a moral turn of thought, will, be&s;ides other bad effects, derogate greatly from the weight of Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition, and will render the &s;train of it much more cold and uninte|re&s;ting. We are always mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the tran&s;actions which are going on, when our &s;ympathy is awakened by the &s;tory, and when we become engaged in the fate of the actors. But this effect can never be pro|duced by a Writer, who is deficient in &s;en&s;i|bility and moral feeling.</P>
<P>As the ob&s;ervations which I have hitherto made, have mo&s;tly re&s;pected the Antient Hi&s;torians, it may naturally be expected, that I &s;hould al&s;o take &s;ome notice of the Moderns who have excelled in this kind of Writing.</P>
<P>THE country in Europe, where the Hi&s;tori|cal Genius has, in latter ages, &s;hone forth with mo&s;t lu&s;tre, beyond doubt is Italy. The national character of the Italians &s;eems favourable to it. They were always di&s;tingui&s;hed as an acute, penetrating, reflecting people, remarkable for political &s;agacity and wi&s;dom, and who early addicted them&s;elves to the arts of Writing. Accordingly, &s;oon after the re&s;toration of
<PB N="70" REF="73">
letters, Machiavel, Guicciardin, Davila, Ben|tivoglio, Father Paul, became highly con&s;pi|cuous for hi&s;torical merit. They all appear to have conceived very ju&s;t ideas of Hi&s;tory; and are agreeable, in&s;tructive, and intere&s;ting Writers. In their manner of narration, they are much formed upon the Ancients; &s;ome of them, as Bentivoglio and Guicciardin, have, in imitation of them, introduced Orations into their Hi&s;tory. In the profoundne&s;s and di&s;tinctne&s;s of their political views, they may, perhaps, be e&s;teemed to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Antients. Critics have, at the &s;ame time, ob&s;erved &s;ome imperfections in each of them. Machiavel, in his Hi&s;tory of Florence, is not altogether &s;o intere&s;ting as one would expect an Author of his abilities to be; either through his own defect, or through &s;ome unhappine&s;s in his &s;ubject, which led him into a very minute detail of the intrigues of one city. Guicciardin, at all times &s;en&s;ible and pro|found, is taxed for dwelling &s;o long on the Tu&s;can affairs as to be &s;ometimes tedious; a defect which is al&s;o imputed, occa&s;ionally to the judicious Father Paul. Bentivoglio, in his excellent Hi&s;tory of the wars of Flan|ders, is accu&s;ed of approaching to the florid and pompous manner: and Davila, though one of the mo&s;t agreeable and entertaining Relaters, has manife&s;tly this defect of &s;pread|ing a &s;ort of uniformity over all his charac|ters, by repre&s;enting them as guided too re|gularly by political intere&s;t. But, although &s;ome &s;uch objections may be made to the&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="74">
Authors, they de&s;erve, upon the whole, to be placed in the fir&s;t rank of Modern Hi&s;|torical Writers. The wars of Flanders, written in Latin by Famianus Strada, is a book of &s;ome note; but is not entitled to the &s;ame reputation as the works of the other Hi&s;torians I have named. Strada is too vio|lently partial to the Spani&s;h cau&s;e; and too open a Panegyri&s;t of the Prince of Parma. He is florid, diffu&s;e, and an affected imitator of the manner and &s;tyle of Livy.</P>
<P>AMONG the French, as there has been much good Writing in many kinds, &s;o al&s;o in the Hi&s;torical. That ingenious nation, who have done &s;o much honour to Modern Literature, po&s;&s;e&s;s, in an eminent degree, the talent of Narration. Many of their later Hi&s;torical Writers are &s;pirited, lively, and agreeable; and &s;ome of them not deficient in profoundne&s;s and penetration. They have not, however, produced any &s;uch capital Hi&s;torians as the Italians, whom I mentioned above.</P>
<P>OUR I&s;land, till within the&s;e few years, was not eminent for its hi&s;torical produc|tions. Early, indeed, Scotland made &s;ome figure by means of the celebrated Buchanan. He is an elegant Writer, cla&s;&s;ical in his La|tinity, and agreeable both in narration and de&s;cription. But one cannot but &s;u&s;pect him to be more attentive to elegance than to ac|curacy. Accu&s;tomed to form his political
<PB N="72" REF="75">
notions wholly upon the plans of ancient governments, the feudal &s;y&s;tem &s;eems never to have entered into his thoughts; and as this was the ba&s;is of the Scotti&s;h con&s;titution, his political views are, of cour&s;e, inaccurate and imperfect. When he comes to the tran&s;|actions of his own time, there is &s;uch a change in his manner of writing, and &s;uch an a&s;perity in his &s;tyle, that, on what &s;ide &s;oever the truth lies with regard to tho&s;e du|bious and long controverted facts which make the &s;ubject of that part of his work, it is impo&s;&s;ible to clear him from being deeply tinctured with the &s;pirit of party.</P>
<P>AMONG the older Engli&s;h Hi&s;torians, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is Lord Clarendon. Though he writes as the profe&s;&s;ed apologi&s;t of one &s;ide, yet there appears more impartiality in his relation of facts, than might at fir&s;t be ex|pected. A great &s;pirit of virtue and probity runs through his work. He maintains all the dignity of an Hi&s;torian. His &s;entences, indeed, are often too long, and his general manner is prolix; but his &s;tyle, on the whole, is manly; and his merit, as a Hi&s;torian, is much beyond mediocrity. Bi&s;hop Burnet is lively and per&s;picuous; but he has hardly any other hi&s;torical merit. His &s;tyle is too carele&s;s and familiar for Hi&s;tory; his characters are, in|deed marked with a bold and &s;trong hand; but they are generally light and &s;atyrical; and he abounds &s;o much in little &s;tories con|cerning him&s;elf, that he re&s;embles more a
<PB N="73" REF="76">
Writer of Memoirs than of Hi&s;tory. During a long period, Engli&s;h Hi&s;torical Authors were little more than dull Compilers; till of late the di&s;tingui&s;hed names of Hume, Ro|bert&s;on, and Gibbon, have rai&s;ed the Briti&s;h character, in this &s;pecies of Writing, to high reputation and dignity.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED, in the preceding Lecture, that Annals, Memoirs, and Lives, are the inferior kinds of Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition. It will be proper, before di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject, to make a few ob&s;ervations upon them. An|nals are commonly under&s;tood to &s;ignify a collection of facts, dige&s;ted according to chro|nological order; rather &s;erving for the mate|rials of Hi&s;tory, than a&s;piring to the name of Hi&s;tory them&s;elves. All that is required, therefore, in a Writer of &s;uch Annals, is to be faithful, di&s;tinct, and complete.</P>
<P>MEMOIRS denote a &s;ort of Compo&s;ition, in which an Author does not pretend to give full information of all the facts re&s;pecting the period of which he writes, but only to relate what he him&s;elf had acce&s;s to know, or what he was concerned in, or what illu&s;trates the conduct of &s;ome per&s;on, or the circum&s;tances of &s;ome tran&s;action, which he choo&s;es for his &s;ubject. From a Writer of Memoirs, there|fore, is not exacted the &s;ame profound re|&s;earch, or enlarged information, as from a Writer of Hi&s;tory. He is not &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws of unvarying dignity and gravity.
<PB N="74" REF="77">
He may talk freely of him&s;elf; he may de|&s;cend into the mo&s;t familiar anecdotes. What is chiefly required of him is, that he be &s;prightly and intere&s;ting; and e&s;pecially, that he inform us of things that are u&s;eful and curious; that he convey to us &s;ome &s;ort of knowledge worth the acquiring. This is a &s;pecies of Writing very bewitching to &s;uch as love to write concerning them&s;elves, and con|ceive every tran&s;action, in which they had a &s;hare, to be of &s;ingular importance. There is no wonder, therefore, that a nation &s;o &s;prightly as the French, &s;hould, for two cen|turies pa&s;t, have been pouring forth a whole flood of Memoirs; the greate&s;t part of which are little more than agreeable trifles.</P>
<P>SOME, however, mu&s;t be excepted from this general character; two in particular; the Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz, and tho&s;e of the Duke of Sully. From Retz's Me|moirs, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure of agreeable and lively narration, we may derive al&s;o much in&s;truction, and much knowledge of human nature. Though his politics be often too fine &s;pun, yet the Memoirs of a profe&s;&s;ed factious leader, &s;uch as the Cardinal was, wherein he draws both his own character, and that of &s;everal great per&s;onages of his time, &s;o fully, cannot be read by any per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e without benefit. The Memoirs of the Duke of Sully, in the &s;tate in which they are now given to the Public, have great merit, and de&s;erve to be mentioned with par|ticular
<PB N="75" REF="78">
prai&s;e. No Memoirs approach more near to the u&s;efulne&s;s, and the dignity of a full legitimate Hi&s;tory. They have this pe|culiar advantage, of giving us a beautiful di&s;play of two of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious charac|ters which hi&s;tory pre&s;ents; Sully him&s;elf, one of the able&s;t, and mo&s;t incorrupt mini&s;ters, and Henry IV. one of the grea|te&s;t and mo&s;t amiable princes of modern times. I know few books more full of virtue, and of good &s;en&s;e, than Sully's Me|moirs; few, therefore, more proper to form both the heads and the hearts of &s;uch as are de&s;igned for public bu&s;ine&s;s, and action in the world.</P>
<P>BIOGRAPHY, or the Writing of Lives, is a very u&s;eful kind of Compo&s;ition; le&s;s for|mal and &s;tately than Hi&s;tory; but to the bulk of Readers, perhaps, no le&s;s in&s;tructive; as it affords them the opportunity of &s;eeing the characters and tempers, the virtues and fail|ings of eminent men fully di&s;played; and admits them into a more thorough and inti|mate acquaintance with &s;uch per&s;ons, than Hi&s;tory generally allows. For a Writer of Lives may de&s;cend, with propriety, to minute circum&s;tances, and familiar incidents. It is expected of him, that he is to give the pri|vate, as well as the public life, of the per&s;on who&s;e actions he records; nay, it is from private life, from familiar, dome&s;tic, and &s;eemingly trivial occurrences, that we often receive mo&s;t light into the real character. In
<PB N="76" REF="79">
this &s;pecies of Writing, Plutarch has no &s;mall merit; and to him we &s;tand indebted for much of the knowledge that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, con|cerning &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;o|nages of antiquity. His matter is, indeed, better than his manner; as he cannot lay claim to any peculiar beauty or elegance. His judgment too, and his accuracy, have &s;ome|times been taxed; but whatever defects of this kind he may be liable to, his Lives of Eminent Men will always be con&s;idered as a valuable trea&s;ure of in&s;truction. He is re|markable for being one of the mo&s;t humane Writers of all antiquity; le&s;s dazzled than many of them are, with the exploits of valour and ambition; and fond of di&s;playing his great men to us, in the more gentle lights of retirement and private life.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude the &s;ubject of Hi&s;tory, without taking notice of a very great improve|ment which has, of late years, begun to be introduced into Hi&s;torical Compo&s;ition; I mean, a more particular attention than was formerly given to laws, cu&s;toms, commerce, religion, literature, and every other thing that tends to &s;how the &s;pirit and genius of nations. It is now under&s;tood to be the bu&s;ine&s;s of an able Hi&s;torian to exhibit manners, as well as facts and events; and a&s;&s;uredly, whatever di&s;plays the &s;tate and life of mankind, in dif|ferent periods, and illu&s;trates the progre&s;s of the human mind, is more u&s;eful and intere&s;t|ing than the detail of &s;ieges and battles. The
<PB N="77" REF="80">
per&s;on, to whom we are mo&s;t indebted for the introduction of this improvement into Hi&s;tory, is the celebrated M. Voltaire, who&s;e genius has &s;hone with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing lu&s;tre, in &s;o many different parts of literature. His Age of Louis XIV. was one of the fir&s;t great pro|ductions in this ta&s;te; and &s;oon drew, through|out all Europe, that general attention, and received that high approbation, which &s;o in|genious and eloquent a production merited. His E&s;&s;ay on the general Hi&s;tory of Europe, &s;ince the days of Charlemagne, is not to be con&s;idered either as a Hi&s;tory, or the proper Plan of an Hi&s;torical Work; but only as a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations on the chief events that have happened throughout &s;everal centuries, and on the changes that &s;ucce&s;&s;ively took place in the &s;pirit and manners of different nations. Though, in &s;ome dates and facts it may, perhaps, be inaccurate, and is tinged with tho&s;e particularities which unhappily di&s;tingui&s;hed Voltaire's manner of thinking on religious &s;ubjects, yet it contains &s;o many enlarged and in&s;tructive views, as ju&s;tly to merit the attention of all who either read or write the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ages.</P>

<P>AS Hi&s;tory is both a very dignified &s;pe|cies of Compo&s;ition, and, by the regu|lar form which it a&s;&s;umes, falls directly under the laws of Critici&s;m, I di&s;cour&s;ed of it fully in the two preceding Lectures.

<P>PHILOSOPHICAL Writing, for in&s;tance, will not lead us into any long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. As the profe&s;&s;ed object of Philo&s;ophy is to con|vey in&s;truction, and as they who &s;tudy it are &s;uppo&s;ed to do &s;o for in&s;truction, not for en|tertainment, the Style, the form, and dre&s;s, of &s;uch Writings, are le&s;s material objects. They are objects, however, that mu&s;t not be

wholly neglected. He who attempts to in|&s;truct mankind, without &s;tudying, at the &s;ame time, to engage their attention, and to intere&s;t them in his &s;ubject by his manner of exhibiting it, is not likely to prove &s;ucce&s;s|ful. The &s;ame truths, and rea&s;onings, deli|vered in a dry and cold manner, or with a proper mea&s;ure of elegance and beauty, will make very different impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of men.</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, that every Philo&s;ophical Writer mu&s;t &s;tudy the utmo&s;t per&s;picuity: and, by reflecting on what was formerly de|livered on the &s;ubject of Per&s;picuity, with re&s;pect both to &s;ingle words, and the con|&s;truction of Sentences, we may be convinced that this is a &s;tudy which demands con&s;idera|ble attention to the rules of Style and good Writing. Beyond mere per&s;picuity, &s;trict accuracy and preci&s;ion are required in a Phi|lo&s;ophical Writer. He mu&s;t employ no words of uncertain meaning, no loo&s;e nor indeterminate expre&s;&s;ions; and &s;hould avoid u&s;ing words which are &s;eemingly &s;ynony|mous, without carefully attending to the va|riation which they make upon the idea.</P>
<P>TO be clear then and preci&s;e, is one re|qui&s;ite which we have a title to demand from every Philo&s;ophical Writer. He may po&s;&s;e&s;s this quality, and be at the &s;ame time a very dry Writer. He &s;hould therefore &s;tudy &s;ome degree of embelli&s;hment, in order to render

his Compo&s;ition plea&s;ing and graceful. One of the mo&s;t agreeable, and one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful embelli&s;hments which a Philo&s;opher can employ, con&s;i&s;ts in illu&s;trations taken from hi&s;torical facts, and the characters of men. All moral and political &s;ubjects natu|rally afford &s;cope for the&s;e; and wherever there is room for employing them, they &s;el|dom fail of producing a happy effect. They diver&s;ify the Compo&s;ition; they relieve the mind from the fatigue of mere rea&s;oning, and at the &s;ame time rai&s;e more full conviction than any rea&s;onings produce: for they take Philo&s;ophy out of the ab&s;tract, and give weight to Speculation, by &s;hewing its con|nection with real life, and the actions of mankind.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHICAL Writing admits be&s;ides of a poli&s;hed, a neat, and elegant Style. It ad|mits of metaphors, Compari&s;ons, and all the calm Figures of Speech, by which an Author may convey his &s;en&s;e to the under&s;tanding with clearne&s;s and force, at the &s;ame time that he entertains the imagination. He mu&s;t take great care, however, that all his orna|ments be of the cha&s;te&s;t kind, never partak|ing of the florid or the tumid; which is &s;o unpardonable in a profe&s;&s;ed Philo&s;opher, that it is much better for him to err on the &s;ide of naked &s;implicity, than on that of too much ornament. Some of the Antients, as Plato and Cicero, have left us Philo&s;ophical Trea|ti&s;es compo&s;ed with much elegance and beau|ty.
<PB N="81" REF="84">
Seneca has been long and ju&s;tly cen&s;ured for the affectation that appears in his Style. He is too fond of a certain brilliant and &s;park|ling manner; of antithe&s;es and quaint &s;en|tences. It cannot be denied, at the &s;ame time, that he often expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with much liveline&s;s and force; though his Style, upon the whole, is far from de&s;erving imita|tion. In Engli&s;h, Mr. Locke's celebrated Treati&s;e on Human Under&s;tanding, may be pointed out as a model, on the one hand, of the greate&s;t clearne&s;s and di&s;tinctne&s;s of Phi|lo&s;ophical Style, with very little approach to ornament: Lord Shaft&s;bury's Writings, on the other hand, exhibit Philo&s;ophy dre&s;&s;ed up with all the ornament which it can admit; perhaps with more than is perfectly &s;uited to it.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHICAL Compo&s;ition &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umes a form, under which it mingles more with works of ta&s;te, when carried on in the way of Dialogue and Conver&s;ation. Under this form the Ancients have given us &s;ome of their chief Philo&s;ophical Works; and &s;everal of the Moderns have endeavoured to imitate them. Dialogue Writing may be executed in two ways, either as direct Conver&s;ation, where none but the Speakers appear, which is the method that Plato u&s;es; or as the re|cital of a Conver&s;ation, where the Author him&s;elf appears, and gives an account of what pa&s;&s;ed in di&s;cour&s;e; which is the method that Cicero generally follows. But though tho&s;e
<PB N="82" REF="85">
different methods make &s;ome variation in the form, yet the nature of the Compo&s;ition is at bottom the &s;ame in both, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws.</P>
<P>A DIALOGUE, in one or other of the&s;e forms, on &s;ome philo&s;ophical, moral, or cri|tical &s;ubject, when it is well conducted, &s;tands in a high rank among the works of ta&s;te; but is much more difficult in the execution than is commonly imagined. For it requires more, than merely the introduction of different per|&s;ons &s;peaking in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It ought to be a natural and &s;pirited repre&s;entation of real conver&s;ation; exhibiting the character, and manners of the &s;everal Speakers, and &s;uiting to the character of each, that peculiarity of thought and expre&s;&s;ion which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from another. A Dialogue, thus con|ducted, gives the Reader a very agreeable en|tertainment; as by means of the debate going on among the per&s;onages, he receives a fair and full view of both &s;ides of the argument; and is, at the &s;ame time, amu&s;ed with polite conver&s;ation, and with a di&s;play of con&s;i&s;tent and well &s;upported characters. An Author, therefore, who has genius for executing &s;uch a Compo&s;ition after this manner, has it in his power both to in&s;truct and to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the greate&s;t part of Modern Dialogue Writers have no idea of any Compo&s;ition of this &s;ort; and bating the outward forms of conver&s;ation, and that one &s;peaks, and ano|ther
<PB N="83" REF="86">
an&s;wers, it is quite the &s;ame as if the Author &s;poke in per&s;on throughout the whole. He &s;ets up a Philotheos perhaps, and a Phi|latheos, or an A and a B; who, after mutual compliments, and after admiring the finene&s;s of the morning or evening, and the beauty of the pro&s;pects around them, enter into confe|rence concerning &s;ome grave matter; and all that we know farther of them is, that the one per&s;onates the Author, a man of learning, no doubt, and of good principles; and the other is a man of &s;traw, &s;et up to propo&s;e &s;ome trivial objections; over which the fir&s;t gains a mo&s;t entire triumph; and leaves his &s;cepti|cal antagoni&s;t at the end much humbled, and generally, convinced of his error. This is a very frigid and in&s;ipid manner of writing; the more &s;o, as it is an attempt toward &s;ome|thing, which we &s;ee the Author cannot &s;up|port. It is the form, without the &s;pirit of conver&s;ation. The Dialogue &s;erves no pur|po&s;e, but to make aukward interruptions; and we would with more patience hear the Author continuing always to rea&s;on him&s;elf, and to remove the objections that are made to his principles, than be troubled with the unmeaning appearance of two per&s;ons, whom we &s;ee to be in reality no more than one.</P>
<P>AMONG the Ancients, Plato is eminent for the beauty of his Dialogues. The &s;cenery, and the circum&s;tances of many of them, are beautifully painted. The characters of the Sophi&s;ts, with whom Socrates di&s;puted, are
<PB N="84" REF="87">
well drawn; a variety of per&s;onages are exhi|bited to us; we are introduced into a real conver&s;ation, often &s;upported with much life and &s;pirit, after the Socratic manner. For richne&s;s and beauty of imagination, no Phi|lo&s;ophic Writer, Ancient or Modern, is com|parable to Plato. The only fault of his imagination is, &s;uch an exce&s;s of ferti|lity as allows it &s;ometimes to ob&s;cure his judgment. It frequently carries him into Allegory, Fiction, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the airy regions of My&s;tical Theology. The Philo&s;o|pher is, at times, lo&s;t in the Poet. But whether we be edified with the matter or not (and much edification he often affords), we are always entertained with the manner; and left with a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ublimity of the Author's genius.</P>
<P>CICERO'S Dialogues, or tho&s;e recitals of conver&s;ation, which he has introduced into &s;everal of his Philo&s;ophical and Critical Works, are not &s;o &s;pirited, nor &s;o characte|ri&s;tical, as tho&s;e of Plato. Yet &s;ome, as that "De Oratore" e&s;pecially, are agreeable and well &s;upported. They &s;how us conver&s;ation carried on among &s;ome of the principal per|&s;ons of antient Rome, with freedom, good breeding, and dignity. The Author of the elegant Dialogue, "De Cau&s;is Corruptae Eloquentiae," which is annexed &s;ometimes to the works of Quinctilian, and &s;ometimes to tho&s;e of Tacitus, has happily imitated, perhaps has excelled Cicero, in this manner of writing.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88">
LUCIAN is a Dialogue Writer of much eminence; though his &s;ubjects are &s;eldom &s;uch as can entitle him to be ranked among Philo&s;ophical Authors. He has given the model of the light and humorous Dialogue, and has carried it to great perfection. A character of levity, and at the &s;ame time of wit and penetration, di&s;tingui&s;h all his writ|ings. His great object was, to expo&s;e the follies of &s;uper&s;tition, and the pedantry of Philo&s;ophy, which prevailed in his age; and he could not have taken any more &s;ucce&s;sful method for this end, than what he has em|ployed in his Dialogues, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the Gods and of the Dead, which are full of plea&s;antry and &s;atire. In this invention of Dialogues of the Dead, he has been followed by &s;everal Modern Authors. Fontenelle, in particular, has given us Dialogues of this &s;ort, which are &s;prightly and agreeable; but as for characters, whoever his per&s;onages be, they all become Frenchmen in his hands. Indeed few things in Compo&s;ition are more difficult, than in the cour&s;e of a Moral Dia|logue to exhibit characters properly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; as calm conver&s;ation furni&s;hes none of tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances for bringing characters into light, which the active &s;cenes, and in|tere&s;ting &s;ituations of the Drama, afford. Hence few Authors are eminent for Charac|teri&s;tical Dialogue on grave &s;ubjects. One of the mo&s;t remarkable in the Engli&s;h language, is a Writer of the la&s;t age, Dr. Henry More, in his Divine Dialogues, relating to the foun|dations
<PB N="86" REF="89">
of Natural Religion. Though his Style be now in &s;ome mea&s;ure ob&s;olete, and his Speakers be marked with the academic &s;tiffne&s;s of tho&s;e times, yet the Dialogue is animated by a variety of Character and a &s;prightline&s;s of Conver&s;ation, beyond what are commonly met with in Writings of this kind. Bi&s;hop Berkeley's Dialogues concern|ing the exi&s;tence of matter, do not attempt any di&s;play of Characters; but furni&s;h an in&s;tance of a very ab&s;tract &s;ubject, rendered clear and intelligible by means of Conver|&s;ation properly managed.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next to make &s;ome ob&s;ervati|ons on Epi&s;tolary Writing; which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a kind of middle place between the &s;erious and amu&s;ing &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition. Epi&s;|tolary Writing appears, at fir&s;t view, to &s;tretch into a very wide field. For there is no &s;ub|ject whatever, on which one may not convey his thoughts to the Public, in the form of a Letter. Lord Shaft&s;bury, for in&s;tance, Mr. Harris, and &s;everal other Writers, have cho|&s;en to give this form to philo&s;ophical treati&s;es. But this is not &s;ufficient to cla&s;s &s;uch treati&s;es under the head of Epi&s;tolary Compo&s;ition. Though they bear, in the title page, a Letter to a Friend, after the fir&s;t addre&s;s, the friend di&s;appears, and we &s;ee, that it is, in truth, the Public with whom the Author corre|&s;ponds. Seneca's Epi&s;tles are of this &s;ort. There is no probability that they ever pa&s;&s;ed in corre&s;pondence, as real letters. They are
<PB N="87" REF="90">
no other than mi&s;cellaneous di&s;&s;ertations on moral &s;ubjects; which the Author, for his convenience, cho&s;e to put into the epi&s;tolary form. Even where one writes a real letter on &s;ome formal topic, as of moral or religious con&s;olation to a per&s;on under di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as Sir William Temple has written to the Coun|te&s;s of E&s;&s;ex on the death of her daughter, he is at liberty, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to write wholly as a Divine or as a Philo&s;opher, and to a&s;&s;ume the &s;tyle and manner of one, with|out reprehen&s;ion. We con&s;ider the Author not as writing a letter, but as compo&s;ing a Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uited particularly to the circum|&s;tances of &s;ome one per&s;on.</P>
<P>EPISTOLARY Writing becomes a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition, &s;ubject to the cogni|zance of Critici&s;m, only or chiefly, when it is of the ea&s;y and familiar kind; when it is conver&s;ation carried on upon paper, be|tween two friends at a di&s;tance. Such an intercour&s;e, when well conducted, may be rendered very agreeable to readers of ta&s;te. If the &s;ubject of the Letters be important, they will be the more valuable. Even though there &s;hould be nothing very con&s;iderable in the &s;ubject, yet if the &s;pirit and turn of the corre&s;pondence be agreeable; if they be written in a &s;prightly manner, and with na|tive grace and ea&s;e, they may &s;till be enter|taining; more e&s;pecially if there be any thing to intere&s;t us, in the characters of tho&s;e who write them. Hence the curio&s;ity which the Public has always di&s;covered, concerning
<PB N="88" REF="91">
the letters of eminent per&s;ons. We expect in them to di&s;cover &s;omewhat of their real character. It is childi&s;h indeed to expect, that in Letters we are to find the whole heart of the Author unveiled. Concealment and di&s;gui&s;e take place, more or le&s;s, in all hu|man intercour&s;e. But &s;till, as Letters from one friend to another make the neare&s;t ap|proach to conver&s;ation, we may expect to &s;ee more of a character di&s;played in the&s;e than in other productions, which are &s;tudied for public view. We plea&s;e our&s;elves with be|holding the Writer in a &s;ituation which allows him to be at his ea&s;e, and to give vent occa&s;ionally to the overflowings of his heart.</P>
<P>MUCH, therefore, of the merit, and the agreeablene&s;s of Epi&s;tolary Writing, will de|pend on its introducing us into &s;ome ac|quaintance with the Writer. There, if any where, we look for the man, not for the Author. Its fir&s;t and fundamental requi&s;ite is, to be natural and &s;imple; for a &s;tiff and laboured manner is as bad in a letter, as it is in conver&s;ation. This does not bani&s;h &s;pright|line&s;s and wit. The&s;e are graceful in Let|ters, ju&s;t as they are in conver&s;ation; when they flow ea&s;ily, and without being &s;tudied; when employed &s;o as to &s;ea&s;on, not to cloy. One who, either in Conver&s;ation or in Let|ters, affects to &s;hine and to &s;parkle always, will not plea&s;e long. The &s;tyle of Letters &s;hould not be too highly poli&s;hed. It ought
<PB N="89" REF="92">
to be neat and correct, but no more. All nicety about words, betrays &s;tudy; and hence mu&s;ical periods, and appearances of number and harmony in arrangement, &s;hould be care|fully avoided in letters. The be&s;t letters are commonly &s;uch as the Authors have written with mo&s;t facility. What the heart or the imagination dictate, always flows readily; but where there is no &s;ubject to warm or intere&s;t the&s;e, con&s;traint appears; and hence, tho&s;e Lettersof mere compliment, congratulation, or affected condolance, which have co&s;t the Authors mo&s;t labour in compo&s;ing, and which, for that rea&s;on, they perhaps con&s;ider as their ma&s;ter-pieces, never fail of being the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable and in&s;ipid to the Readers.</P>
<P>IT ought at the &s;ame time to be remem|bered, that the ea&s;e and &s;implicity which I have recommended in Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pond|ence, is not to be under&s;tood as importing entire carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. In writing to the mo&s;t intimate friend, a certain degree of attention, both to the &s;ubject and the &s;tyle, is requi&s;ite and becoming. It is no more, than what we owe both to our&s;elves, and to the friend with whom we corre&s;pond. A &s;lovenly and ne|glected manner of Writing, is a di&s;obliging mark of want of re&s;pect. The liberty, be|&s;ides, of writing Letters with too carele&s;s a hand, is apt to betray per&s;ons into impru|dence in what they write. The fir&s;t requi|&s;ite, both in conver&s;ation and corre&s;pondence,
<PB N="90" REF="93">
is to attend to all the proper decorums which our own character, and that of others, de|mand. An imprudent expre&s;&s;ion in conver|&s;ation may be forgotten and pa&s;s away; but when we take the pen into our hand, we mu&s;t remember, that <Q REND="inline">"Litera &s;cripta manet."</Q></P>
<P>PLINY'S Letters are one of the mo&s;t cele|brated collections which the Ancients have given us, in the epi&s;tolary way. They are elegant and polite; and exhibit a very plea&s;|ing and amiable view of the Author. But, according to the vulgar phra&s;e, they &s;mell too much of the lamp. They are too ele|gant and fine; and it is not ea&s;y to avoid thinking, that the Author is ca&s;ting an eye towards the Public, when he is appearing to write only for his friends. Nothing indeed is more difficult, than for an Author, who publi&s;hes his own letters, to dive&s;t him&s;elf altogether of attention to the opinion of the world in what he &s;ays; by which means, he becomes much le&s;s agreeable than a man of parts would be, if, without any con&s;traint of this &s;ort, he were writing to his intimate friend.</P>
<P>CICERO'S Epi&s;tles, though not &s;o &s;howy as tho&s;e of Pliny, are, on &s;everal accounts, a far more valuable collection; indeed, the mo&s;t valuable collection of Letters extant in any language. They are letters of real bu|&s;ine&s;s, written to the greate&s;t men of the age, compo&s;ed with purity and elegance, but with|out
<PB N="91" REF="94">
the lea&s;t affectation; and, what adds greatly to their merit, written without any intention of being publi&s;hed to the world. For it appears, that Cicero never kept copies of his own letters; and we are wholly in|debted to the care of his freed-man Tyro, for the large collection that was made, after his death, of tho&s;e which are now extant, a|mounting to near a thou&s;and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his Letter to Atticus, which was written a year or two before his death, in which he tells him, in an&s;wer to &s;ome enquiries concerning his Epi&s;tles, that he had no collection of them, and that Tyro had only about &s;eventy of them.
<BIBL>Ad ATT. 16. 5.</BIBL></NOTE>. They contain the mo&s;t authentic materials of the hi&s;tory of that age; and are the la&s;t monuments which remain of Rome in its free &s;tate; the greate&s;t part of them being written during that im|portant cri&s;is, when the Republic was on the point of ruin; the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ituation, perhaps, which is to be found in the affairs of mankind. To his intimate friends, e&s;pe|cially to Atticus, Cicero lays open him&s;elf and his heart, with entire freedom. In the cour&s;e of his corre&s;pondence with others, we are introduced into acquaintance with &s;everal of the principal per&s;onages of Rome; and it is remarkable that mo&s;t of Cicero's corre|&s;pondents, as well as him&s;elf, are elegant and polite Writers; which &s;erves to heighten our idea of the ta&s;te and manners of that age.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed collection of Let|ters in the Engli&s;h Language, is that of Mr.
<PB N="92" REF="95">
Pope, Dean Swift, and their friends; partly publi&s;hed in Mr. Pope's Works, and partly in tho&s;e of Dean Swift. This Collection is, on the whole, an entertaining and agreeable one; and contains much wit and ingenuity. It is not, however, altogether free of the fault which I imputed to Pliny's Epi&s;tles, of too much &s;tudy and refinement. In the variety of Letters from different per&s;ons, contained in that Collection, we find many that are writ|ten with ea&s;e, and a beautiful &s;implicity. Tho&s;e of Dr. Arbuthnot, in particular, al|ways de&s;erve that prai&s;e. Dean Swift's al&s;o are unaffected; and as a proof of their being &s;o, they exhibit his character fully, with all its defects; though it were to be wi&s;hed, for the honour of his memory, that his Epi&s;tola|ry Corre&s;pondence had not been drained to the dregs, by &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive publications, as have been given to the world. Several of Lord Bolingbroke's, and of Bi&s;hop Atterbu|ry's Letters, are ma&s;terly. The cen&s;ure of writing Letters in too artificial a manner, falls heavie&s;t on Mr. Pope him&s;elf. There is vi&s;i|bly more &s;tudy, and le&s;s of nature and the heart in his Letters, than in tho&s;e of &s;ome of his corre&s;pondents. He had formed him&s;elf on the manner of Voiture, and is too fond of writing like a wit. His Letters to Ladies are full of affectation. Even in writing to his friends, how forced an Introduction is the fol|lowing of a Letter to Mr. Addi&s;on: <Q REND="inline">"I am more joyed at your return, than I &s;hould be at that of the Sun, as much as I wi&s;h for
<PB N="93" REF="96">
him in this melancholy wet &s;ea&s;on; but it is his fate too, like yours, to be di&s;plea&s;ing to owls and ob&s;cene animals, who cannot bear his lu&s;tre."</Q> How &s;tiff a compliment is it, which he pays to Bi&s;hop Atterbury? <Q REND="inline">"Though the noi&s;e and daily bu&s;tle for the Public be now over, I dare &s;ay, you are &s;till tendering its welfare; as the Sun in winter, when &s;eeming to retire from the world, is preparing warmth and benedicti|ons for a better &s;ea&s;on."</Q> This &s;entence might be tolerated in a harangue; but is very un|&s;uitable to the Style of one friend corre&s;pond|ing with another.</P>
<P>THE gaiety and vivacity of the French genius appear to much advantage in their Letters, and have given birth to &s;everal agree|able publications. In the la&s;t age, Balzac and Voiture were the two mo&s;t celebrated Epi&s;to|lary Writers. Balzac's reputation indeed &s;oon declined, on account of his &s;welling periods and pompous Style. But Voiture continued long a favourite Author. His Compo&s;ition is extremely &s;parkling; he &s;hows a great deal of wit, and can trifle in the mo&s;t entertaining manner. His only fault is, that he is too open and profe&s;&s;ed a wit, to be thoroughly agreeable as a Letter Writer. The Letters of Madam de Sevign&egrave;, are now e&s;teemed the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed model of a familiar corre|&s;pondence. They turn indeed very much upon trifles, the incidents of the day and the news of the town; and they are overloaded
<PB N="94" REF="97">
with extravagant compliments, and expre&s;&s;i|ons of fondne&s;s, to her favourite daughter; but withal, they &s;how &s;uch perpetual &s;pright|line&s;s, they contain &s;uch ea&s;y and varied nar|ration, and &s;o many &s;trokes of the mo&s;t lively and beautiful painting, perfectly free from any affectation, that they are ju&s;tly intitled to high prai&s;e. The Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague are not unworthy of be|ing named after tho&s;e of Mad. de Sevign&egrave;. They have much of the French ea&s;e and vivacity; and retain more the character of agreeable Epi&s;tolary Style, than perhaps any Letters which have appeared in the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P>THERE remains to be treated of, another &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition in pro&s;e, which com|prehends a very numerous, though, in gene|ral, a very in&s;ignificant cla&s;s of Writings, known by the name of Romances and Novels. The&s;e may, at fir&s;t view, &s;eem too in&s;ignifi|cant, to de&s;erve that any particular notice &s;hould be taken of them. But I cannot be of this opinion. Mr. Fletcher of Salton, in one of his Tracts, quotes it as the &s;aying of a wi&s;e man, that give him the making of all the ballads of a nation, he would allow any one that plea&s;ed to make their laws. The &s;aying was founded on reflection and good &s;en&s;e, and applies to the &s;ubject now before us. For any kind of Writing, how trifling &s;oever in appearance, that obtains a general currency, and e&s;pecially that early preoccupies
<PB N="95" REF="98">
the imagination of the youth of both &s;exes, mu&s;t demand particular attention. Its influ|ence is likely to be con&s;iderable, both on the morals, and ta&s;te of a nation.</P>
<P>IN fact, fictitious hi&s;tories might be employ|ed for very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. They furni&s;h one of the be&s;t channels for conveying in&s;truc|tion, for painting human life and manners, for &s;howing the errors into which we are be|trayed by our pa&s;&s;ions, for rendering virtue amiable and vice odious. The effect of well contrived &s;tories, towards accompli&s;hing the&s;e purpo&s;es, is &s;tronger than any effect that can be produced by &s;imple and naked in&s;truction; and hence we find, that the wi&s;e&s;t men in all ages, have more or le&s;s employed fables and fictions, as the vehicles of knowledge. The&s;e have ever been the ba&s;is of both Epic and Dramatic Poetry. It is not, therefore, the nature of this &s;ort of Writing con&s;idered in it&s;elf, but the faulty manner of its execution, that can expo&s;e it to any contempt. Lord Bacon takes notice of our ta&s;te for fictitious hi&s;tory, as a proof of the greatne&s;s and digni|ty of the human mind. He ob&s;erves very ingeniou&s;ly, that the objects of this world, and the common traits of affairs which we behold going on in it, do not fill the mind, nor give it entire &s;atisfaction. We &s;eek for &s;omething that &s;hall expand the mind in a greater degree: we &s;eek for more heroic and illu&s;trious deeds, for more diver&s;ified and &s;ur|pri&s;ing events, for a more &s;plendid order of

<P>IN all countries we find its origin very an|cient. The genius of the Ea&s;tern nations, in particular, was from the earlie&s;t times much turned towards invention, and the love of fiction. Their Divinity, their Phi|lo&s;ophy, and their Politics, were cloathed in fables and parables. The Indians, the Per|&s;ians, and Arabians, were all famous for their tales. The "Arabian Night's Enter|tainments" are the production of a roman|tic invention, but of a rich and amu&s;ing imagination; exhibiting a &s;ingular and curi|ous di&s;play of manners and characters, and beautified with a very humane morality.
<PB N="97" REF="100">
Among the ancient Greeks, we hear of the Ionian and Mile&s;ian Tales; but they are now peri&s;hed, and, from any account that we have of them, appear to have been of the loo&s;e and wanton kind. Some fictitious hi&s;|tories yet remain, that were compo&s;ed during the decline of the Roman Empire, by Apu|leius, Achilles Tatius, and Heliodorus, bi&s;hop of Trica, in the 4th century; but none of them are con&s;iderable enough to merit par|ticular critici&s;m.</P>
<P>DURING the dark ages, this &s;ort of writ|ing a&s;&s;umed a new and very &s;ingular form, and for a long while made a great figure in the world. The martial &s;pirit of tho&s;e na|tions, among whom the feudal government prevailed; the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ingle com|bat, as an allowed method of deciding cau&s;es both of ju&s;tice and honour; the appointment of champions in the cau&s;e of women, who could not maintain their own rights by the &s;word; together with the in&s;titution of mili|tary tournaments, in which different king|doms vied with one another, gave ri&s;e, in tho&s;e times, to that marvellous &s;y&s;tem of chi|valry, which is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular ap|pearances in the hi&s;tory of mankind. Upon this were founded tho&s;e romances of knight|errantry, which carried an ideal chivalry, to a &s;till more extravagant height than it had ri&s;en in fact. There was di&s;played in them a new and very wonderful &s;ort of world, hardly bearing any re&s;emblance to the world in
<PB N="98" REF="101">
which we dwell. Not only knights &s;etting forth to redre&s;s all manner of wrongs, but in every page magicians, dragons, and giants, invulnerable men, winged hor&s;es, enchanted armour, and enchanted ca&s;tles; adventures ab|&s;olutely incredible, yet &s;uited to the gro&s;s igno|rance of the&s;e ages, and to the legends, and &s;u|per&s;titious notions concerning magic and necro|mancy, which then prevailed. This merit they had, of being writings of the highly moral and heroic kind. Their knights were patterns, not of courage merely, but of religion, genero&s;ity, courte&s;y, and fidelity; and the heroines were no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for mode&s;ty, delicacy, and the utmo&s;t dignity of manners.</P>
<P>THESE were the fir&s;t compo&s;itions that re|ceived the name of Romances. The origin of this name is traced, by Mr. Huet the learned bi&s;hop of Avranche, to the proven&ccedil;al Troubadoures, a &s;ort of &s;tory-tellers and bards in the county of Proven&ccedil;e, where there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ome remains of literature and poetry. The language that prevailed in that country was a mixture of Latin and Gallic, called the Roman or Romance Language; and their &s;tories being written in that lan|guage, hence it is &s;aid the name of Romance, which we now apply to all fictitious Com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE earlie&s;t of tho&s;e Romances is that which goes under the name of Turpin, the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, written in the 11th
<PB N="99" REF="102">
century. The &s;ubject is, the Atchievements of Charlemagne and his peers, or Paladins, in driving the Saracens out of France and part of Spain; the &s;ame &s;ubject which Ari|o&s;to has taken for his celebrated poem of Orlando Furio&s;o, which is truly a Chivalry Romance, as extravagant as any of the re&s;t, but partly heroic, and partly comic, embel|li&s;hed with the highe&s;t graces of poetry. The Romance of Turpin was followed by Amadis de Gaul, and many more of the &s;ame &s;tamp. The Cru&s;ades both furni&s;hed new matter, and increa&s;ed the &s;pirit for &s;uch Writings; the Chri&s;tians again&s;t the Saracens made the common ground-work of them; and from the 11th to the 16th century, they continued to bewitch all Europe. In Spain, where the ta&s;te for this &s;ort of writing had been mo&s;t greedily caught, the ingenious Cervantes, in the beginning of the la&s;t century, contri|buted greatly to explode it; and the aboli|tion of tournaments, the prohibition of &s;in|gle combat, the di&s;belief of magic and en|chantments, and the change in general of manners throughout Europe, began to give a new turn to fictitious Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THEN appeared the A&s;traea of D'urfe, the Grand Cyrus, the Clelia and Cleopatra of Mad. Scuderi, the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sid|ney, and other grave and &s;tately Compo&s;iti|ons in the &s;ame &s;tyle. The&s;e may be con&s;i|dered as forming the &s;econd &s;tage of Romance Writing. The heroi&s;m and the gallantry,
<PB N="100" REF="103">
the moral and virtuous turn of the chivalry romance, were &s;till pre&s;erved; but the dra|gons, the necromancers, and the enchanted ca&s;tles, were bani&s;hed, and &s;ome &s;mall re|&s;emblance to human nature was introduced. Still, however, there was too much of the marvellous in them to plea&s;e an age which now a&s;pired to refinement. The characters were di&s;cerned to be &s;trained; the &s;tyle to be &s;woln; the adventures incredible: the books them&s;elves were voluminous and tedious.</P>
<P>HENCE, this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition &s;oon a&s;|&s;umed a third form, and from magnificent Heroic Romance, dwindled down to the Fa|miliar Novel. The&s;e Novels, both in France and England, during the age of Lewis XIV. and King Charles II. were in general of a trifling nature, without the appearance of moral tendency, or u&s;eful in&s;truction. Since that time, however, &s;omewhat better has been attempted, and a degree of reformation introduced into the &s;pirit of Novel Writing. Imitations of life and character have been made their principal object. Relations have been profe&s;&s;ed to be given of the behaviour of per&s;ons in particular intere&s;ting &s;ituations, &s;uch as may actually occur in life; by means of which, what is laudable or defective in character and in conduct, may be pointed out, and placed in a u&s;eful light. Upon this plan, the French have produced &s;ome compo|&s;itions of con&s;iderable merit. Gil Blas, by Le Sage, is a book full of good &s;en&s;e, and in&s;tructive knowledge of the world. The
<PB N="101" REF="104">
works of Marivaux, e&s;pecially his Marianne, di&s;cover great refinement of thought, great penetration into human nature, and paint, with a very delicate pencil, &s;ome of the nice&s;t &s;hades and features in the di&s;tinction of cha|racters. The Nouvelle Heloi&s;e of Rou&s;&s;eau is a production of a very &s;ingular kind; in many of the events which are related, impro|bable and unnatural; in &s;ome of the details tedious, and for &s;ome of the &s;cenes which are de&s;cribed ju&s;tly blameable; but withal, for the power of eloquence, for tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment, for ardour of pa&s;&s;ion, entitled to rank among the highe&s;t productions of Ficti|tious Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IN this kind of Writing we are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in Great Britain, inferior to the French We neither relate &s;o agreeably, nor draw characters with &s;o much delicacy; yet we are not without &s;ome performances which di&s;cover the &s;trength of the Briti&s;h genius. No fiction, in any language, was ever better &s;upported than the Adventures of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe. While it is carried on with that ap|pearance of truth and &s;implicity, which takes a &s;trong hold of the imagination of all Rea|ders, it &s;ugge&s;ts, at the &s;ame time, very u&s;eful in&s;truction; by &s;howing how much the native powers of man may be exerted for &s;urmount|ing the difficulties of any external &s;ituation. Mr. Fielding's Novels are highly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for their humour; a humour which, if not of the mo&s;t refined and delicate kind, is origi|nal,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
and peculiar to him&s;elf. The characters which he draws are lively and natural, and marked with the &s;trokes of a bold pencil. The general &s;cope of his &s;tories is favourable to humanity and goodne&s;s of heart; and in Tom Jones, his greate&s;t work, the artful con|duct of the fable, and the &s;ub&s;erviency of all the incidents to the winding up of the whole, de&s;erve much prai&s;e. The mo&s;t moral of all our novel Writers is Richard&s;on, the Author of Clari&s;&s;a, a Writer of excellent intentions, and of very con&s;iderable capacity and genius; did he not po&s;&s;e&s;s the unfortunate talent of &s;pinning out pieces of amu&s;ement into an im|men&s;urable length. The trivial performances which daily appear in public under the title of Lives, Adventures, and Hi&s;tories, by ano|nymous Authors, if they be often innocent, yet are mo&s;t commonly in&s;ipid; and, though in the general it ought to be admitted that Characteri&s;tical Novels, formed upon Nature and upon Life, without extravagance, and without licentiou&s;ne&s;s, might furni&s;h an agree|able and u&s;eful entertainment to the mind; yet according as the&s;e Writings have been, for the mo&s;t part, conducted, it mu&s;t al&s;o be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that they oftner tend to di&s;&s;ipation and idlene&s;s, than to any good purpo&s;e. Let us now therefore make our retreat from the&s;e regions of fiction.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXVIII. NATURE OF POETRY&mdash;ITS ORIGIN AND PROGRESS&mdash;VERSIFICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my ob&s;ervations on the different kinds of Writing in Pro&s;e. What remains is, to treat of Poetical Com|po&s;ition. Before entering on the con&s;iderati|on of any of its particular kinds, I de&s;ign this Lecture as an Introduction to the &s;ubject of Poetry in general; wherein I &s;hall treat of its nature, give an account of its ri&s;e and origin, and make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on Ver&s;i|fication, or Poetical Numbers.</P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t enquiry mu&s;t be, what is Poetry? and wherein does it differ from Pro&s;e? The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion is not &s;o ea&s;y as might at fir&s;t be imagined; and Critics have differed and di&s;puted much, concerning the proper definition of Poetry. Some have made its
<PB N="104" REF="107">
e&s;&s;ence to con&s;i&s;t in fiction, and &s;upport their opinion by the authority of Ari&s;to|tle and Plato. But this is certainly too li|mited a definition; for though fiction may have a great &s;hare in many Poetical Compo|&s;itions, yet many &s;ubjects of Poetry may not be feigned; as where the Poet de&s;cribes ob|jects which actually exi&s;t, or pours forth the real &s;entiments of his own heart. Others have made the characteri&s;tic of Poetry to lie in Imitation. But this is altogether loo&s;e; for &s;everal other arts imitate as well as Poetry; and an imitation of human manners and characters, may be carried on in the humble&s;t Pro&s;e, no le&s;s than in the mo&s;t lof|ty Poetic &s;train.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t ju&s;t and comprehen&s;ive defini|tion which, I think, can be given of Poetry, is, <Q REND="inline">"That it is the language of pa&s;&s;ion, or of enlivened imagination, formed, mo&s;t com|monly, into regular numbers."</Q> The Hi&s;|torian, the Orator, the Philo&s;opher, addre&s;s them&s;elves, for the mo&s;t part, primarily to the under&s;tanding: their direct aim is to in|form, to per&s;uade, or to in&s;truct. But the primary aim of a Poet is to plea&s;e, and to move; and, therefore, it is to the Imaginati|on, and the Pa&s;&s;ions, that he &s;peaks. He may, and he ought to have it in his view, to in&s;truct, and to reform; but it is indirectly, and by plea&s;ing and moving, that he accom|pli&s;hes this end. His mind is &s;uppo&s;ed to be animated by &s;ome intere&s;ting object which
<PB N="105" REF="108">
fires his Imagination, or engages his Pa&s;&s;ions; and which, of cour&s;e, communicates to his Style a peculiar elevation &s;uited to his ideas; very different from that mode of expre&s;&s;ion, which is natural to the mind in its calm, or|dinary &s;tate. I have added to my definition, that this language of Pa&s;&s;ion, or Imagination, is formed, <HI>mo&s;t commonly,</HI> into regular num|bers; becau&s;e, though Ver&s;ification be, in general, the exterior di&s;tinction of Poetry, yet there are &s;ome forms of Ver&s;e &s;o loo&s;e and familiar, as to be hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable from Pro&s;e; &s;uch as the Ver&s;e of Terence's Comedies; and there is al&s;o a &s;pecies of Pro&s;e, &s;o mea&s;ured in its cadence, and &s;o much rai&s;ed in its tone, as to approach very near to Poetical Numbers; &s;uch as the Telemachus of Fenelon; and the Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation of O&s;&s;ian. The truth is, Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, run into one another, like light and &s;hade. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to de|termine the exact limit where Eloquence ends, and Poetry begins; nor is there any occa&s;ion for being very preci&s;e about the boundaries, as long as the nature of each is under&s;tood. The&s;e are the minutiae of Critici&s;m, concern|ing which, frivolous Writers are always di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;quabble; but which de&s;erve not any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The truth and ju&s;tne&s;s of the definition, which I have given of Poetry, will appear more fully from the account which I am now to give of its origin; and which will tend to throw light on much
<PB N="106" REF="109">
of what I am afterwards to deliver, concern|ing its various kinds.</P>
<P>THE Greeks, ever fond of attributing to their own nation the invention of all &s;ciences and arts, have a&s;cribed the origin of Poetry to Orpheus, Linus, and Mu&s;aeus. There were, perhaps, &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e, who were the fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Bards in the Gre|cian countries. But long before &s;uch names were heard of, and among nations where they were never known, Poetry exi&s;ted. It is a great error to imagine, that Poetry and Mu&s;ic are Arts which belong only to poli&s;hed nati|ons. They have their foundation in the nature of man, and belong to all nations, and to all ages; though, like other Arts founded in nature, they have been more cultivated, and, from a concurrence of favourable circum|&s;tances, carried to greater perfection in &s;ome countries, than in others. In order to ex|plore the ri&s;e of Poetry, we mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to the de&s;erts and the wilds; we mu&s;t go back to the age of hunters and of &s;hep|herds; to the highe&s;t antiquity; and to the &s;imple&s;t form of manners among mankind.</P>
<P>IT has been often &s;aid, and the concurring voice of all antiquity affirms, that Poetry is older than Pro&s;e. But in what &s;en&s;e this &s;eemingly &s;trange paradox holds true, has not always been well under&s;tood. There never, certainly, was any period of &s;ociety, in which men conver&s;ed together in Poetical
<PB N="107" REF="110">
Numbers. It was in very humble and &s;canty Pro&s;e, as we may ea&s;ily believe, that the fir&s;t tribes carried on intercour&s;e among them&s;elves, relating to the wants and nece&s;&s;ities of life. But from the very beginning of Society, there were occa&s;ions on which they met toge|ther for fea&s;ts, &s;acrifices, and Public A&s;&s;em|blies; and on all &s;uch occa&s;ions, it is well known, that mu&s;ic, &s;ong, and dance, made their principal entertainment. It is chiefly in America, that we have had the opportunity of being made acquainted with men in their &s;avage &s;tate. We learn from the particular and concurring accounts of Travellers, that, among all the nations of that va&s;t continent, e&s;pecially among the Northern Tribes, with whom we have had mo&s;t intercour&s;e, mu&s;ic and &s;ong are, at all their meetings, carried on with an incredible degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; that the Chiefs of the Tribe are tho&s;e who &s;igna|lize them&s;elves mo&s;t on &s;uch occa&s;ions; that it is in Songs they celebrate their religious rites; that, by the&s;e they lament their public and private calamities, the death of friends, or the lo&s;s of warriors; expre&s;s their joy on their victories; celebrate the great actions of their nation, and their heroes; excite each other to perform brave exploits in war, or to &s;uffer death and torments with un&s;haken con|&s;tancy.</P>
<P>HERE then we &s;ee the fir&s;t beginnings of Poetic Compo&s;ition, in tho&s;e rude effu&s;ions, which the enthu&s;ia&s;m of fancy or pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="108" REF="111">
&s;ugge&s;ted to untaught men, when rou&s;ed by intere&s;ting events, and by their meeting to|gether in Public a&s;&s;emblies. Two particulars would early di&s;tingui&s;h this language of &s;ong, from that in which they conver&s;ed on the common occurrences of life; namely, an un|u&s;ual arrangement of words, and the employ|ment of bold figures of &s;peech. It would invert words, or change them from that or|der in which they are commonly placed, to that which mo&s;t &s;uited the train in which they ro&s;e in the Speaker's imagination; or which was mo&s;t accommodated to the ca|dence of the pa&s;&s;ion by which he was moved. Under the influence too of any &s;trong emo|tion, objects do not appear to us &s;uch as they really are, but &s;uch as pa&s;&s;ion makes us &s;ee them. We magnify and exaggerate; we &s;eek to intere&s;t all others in what cau&s;es our emotion; we compare the lea&s;t things to the greate&s;t; we call upon the ab&s;ent as well as the pre&s;ent, and even addre&s;s our&s;elves to things inanimate. Hence, in congruity with tho&s;e various movements of the mind, ari&s;e tho&s;e turns of expre&s;&s;ion, which we now di&s;tingui&s;h by the learned names of Hyper|bole, Pro&s;opopoeia, Simile, &amp;c. but which are no other than the native original lan|guage of Poetry, among the mo&s;t barbarous nations.</P>
<P>MAN is both a Poet, and a Mu&s;ician, by nature. The &s;ame impul&s;e which prompted the enthu&s;ia&s;tic Poetic Style, prompted a cer|tain
<PB N="109" REF="112">
melody, or modulation of &s;ound, &s;uited to the emotions of Joy or Grief, of Admiration, Love, or Anger. There is a power in &s;ound, which, partly from nature, partly from habit and a&s;&s;ociation, makes &s;uch pathetic impre&s;&s;ions on the fancy, as delight even the mo&s;t wild bar|barians Mu&s;ic and Poetry, therefore, had the &s;ame ri&s;e; they were prompted by the &s;ame occa&s;ions; they were united in &s;ong; and, as long as they continued united, they tended without doubt, mutually to heighten and ex|alt each other's power. The fir&s;t Poets &s;ung their own ver&s;es; and hence the beginning of what we call, Ver&s;ification, or words ar|ranged in a more artful order than Pro&s;e, &s;o as to be &s;uited to &s;ome tune or melody. The liberty of tran&s;po&s;ition, or inver&s;ion, which the Poetic Style, as I ob&s;erved, would natu|rally a&s;&s;ume, made it ea&s;ier to form the words into &s;ome &s;ort of numbers that fell in with the mu&s;ic of the &s;ong. Very har&s;h and un|couth, we may ea&s;ily believe, the&s;e numbers would be at fir&s;t. But the plea&s;ure was felt; it was &s;tudied; and Ver&s;ification, by degrees, pa&s;&s;ed into an Art.</P>
<P>IT appears from what has been &s;aid, that the fir&s;t Compo&s;itions, which were either re|corded by writing, or tran&s;mitted by Tra|dition, could be no other than Poetical Com|po&s;itions. No other but the&s;e, could draw the attention of men in their rude uncivil|ized &s;tate. Indeed, they knew no other. Cool rea&s;oning, and plain di&s;cour&s;e, had no
<PB N="110" REF="113">
power to attract &s;avage Tribes, addicted only to hunting and war. There was nothing that could either rou&s;e the Speaker to pour him&s;elf forth, or draw the croud to li&s;ten, but the high powers of Pa&s;&s;ion, of Mu&s;ic, and of Song. This vehicle, therefore, and no other, could be employed by Chiefs and Legi&s;lators, when they meant to in&s;truct, or to animate their Tribes. There is likewi&s;e, a farther rea&s;on why &s;uch Compo&s;itions only could be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity; becau&s;e, before Writing was invented, Songs only could la&s;t, and be remembered. The ear gave a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the memory, by the help of Numbers; fathers repeated and &s;ung them to their chil|dren; and by this oral tradition of national Ballads, was conveyed all the hi&s;torical knowledge, and all the in&s;truction, of the fir&s;t ages.</P>
<P>THE earlie&s;t accounts which Hi&s;tory gives us concerning all nations, bear te&s;timony to the&s;e facts. In the fir&s;t ages of Greece, Prie&s;ts, Philo&s;ophers, and State&s;men, all delivered their in&s;tructions in Poetry. Apollo, Or|pheus, and Amphion, their mo&s;t ancient Bards, are repre&s;ented as the fir&s;t tamers of mankind, the fir&s;t founders of law and ci|vili&s;ation. Minos and Thales, &s;ung to the Lyre the laws which they compo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Strabo, l. 10.</NOTE>; and till the age immediately preceding that of
<PB N="111" REF="114">
Herodotus, Hi&s;tory had appeared in no other form than that of Poetical Tales.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner, among all other na|tions, Poets and Songs are the fir&s;t objects that make their appearance. Among the Scythian or Gothic nations, many of their kings and leaders were Scalders, or Poets; and it is from their Runic Songs, that the mo&s;t early Writers of their Hi&s;tory, &s;uch as Saxo-Grammaticus, acknowledge, that they had derived their chief information. Among the Celtic Tribes, in Gaul, Britain, and Ire|land, we know, in what admiration their Bards were held, and how great influence they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over the people. They were both Poets and Mu&s;icians, as all the fir&s;t Poets, in every country, were. They were always near the per&s;on of the chief or &s;ove|reign; they recorded all his great exploits; they were employed as the amba&s;&s;adors be|tween contending tribes, and their per&s;ons were held &s;acred.</P>
<P>FROM this deduction it follows, that as we have rea&s;on to look for Poems and Songs among the antiquities of all countries, &s;o we may expect, that in the &s;train of the&s;e there will be a remarkable re&s;emblance, during the primitive periods of every country. The oc|ca&s;ions of their being compo&s;ed, are every where nearly the &s;ame. The prai&s;es of Gods and heroes, the celebration of famed ance&s;|tors, the recital of martial deeds, &s;ongs of
<PB N="112" REF="115">
victory, and &s;ongs of lamentation over the the misfortunes and death of their country|men, occur among all nations; and the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m and fire, the &s;ame wild and irre|gular, but animated Compo&s;ition, conci&s;e and glowing Style, bold and extravagant Figures of Speech, are the general di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characters of all the mo&s;t antient original Poetry. That &s;trong hyperbolical manner which we have been long accu&s;tomed to call the Oriental manner of poetry (becau&s;e &s;ome of the earlie&s;t poetical productions came to us from the Ea&s;t), is in truth no more Ori|ental than Occidental; it is characteri&s;tical of an age rather than of a country; and belongs, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to all nations at that period which fir&s;t gives ri&s;e to Mu&s;ic and to Song. Mankind never re&s;emble each other, &s;o much as they do in the beginnings of &s;ociety. Its &s;ub&s;equent revolutions, give birth to the principal di&s;tinctions of character among na|tions, and divert into channels widely &s;epa|rated, that current of human genius and manners, which de&s;cends originally from one &s;pring.</P>
<P>DIVERSITY of climate, and of manner of living, will, however, occa&s;ion &s;ome diver|&s;ity in the &s;train of the fir&s;t Poetry of na|tions; chiefly according as tho&s;e nations are of a more ferocious, or of a more gentle &s;pi|rit; and according as they advance fa&s;ter or &s;lower, in the arts of civilization.

Poetry remarkable fierce, and breathing no|thing but &s;laughter and blood; while the Peruvian and the Chine&s;e &s;ongs turned, from the earlie&s;t times, upon milder &s;ubjects. The Celtic poetry in the days of O&s;&s;ian, though chiefly of the martial kind, yet had attained a con&s;iderable mixture of tenderne&s;s and re|finement; in con&s;equence of the long culti|vation of Poetry among the Celtae, by means of a &s;eries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bards which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed for ages.

<P>AMONG the Grecian nations, their early Poetry appears to have &s;oon received a phi|lo&s;ophical ca&s;t, from what we are informed concerning the &s;ubjects of Orpheus, Linus, and Mu&s;aeus, who treated of Creation and of Chaos, of the Generation of the World, and of the Ri&s;e of Things; and we know that the Greeks advanced &s;ooner to philo&s;o|phy, and proceeded with a quicker pace in all the arts of refinement than mo&s;t other nations.</P>

THE Arabians and the Per&s;ians have al|ways been the greate&s;t Poets of the Ea&s;t; and among them, as among other nations, Poetry was the earlie&s;t vehicle of all their learning and in&s;truction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vid. Voyages de Chardin, chap. de la Po&euml;&s;ie des Per&s;ans.</NOTE>. The antient Arabs, we are informed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Vid. Preliminary Di&s;cour&s;e to Sale's Tran&s;lation of the Koran.</NOTE>, valued them&s;elves much on their metrical Compo&s;itions, which were of two &s;orts; the one they compared to loo&s;e pearls, and the other to pearls &s;trung. In the for|mer, the &s;entences or ver&s;es were without connection; and their beauty aro&s;e from the elegance of the expre&s;&s;ion, and the acutene&s;s of the &s;entiment. The moral doctrines of the Per&s;ians were generally comprehended in &s;uch independent proverbial apothegms, form|ed into ver&s;e. In this re&s;pect they bear a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance to the Proverbs of Solomon; a great part of which book con&s;i&s;ts of unconnected Poetry, like the loo&s;e pearls of the Arabians. The &s;ame form of Compo|&s;ition appears al&s;o in the Book of Job. The Greeks &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t who intro|duced a more regular &s;tructure, and clo&s;er connection of parts, into their Poetical Writings.</P>
<P>DURING the infancy of Poetry, all the different kinds of it lay confu&s;ed, and were mingled in the &s;ame compo&s;ition, according as inclination, enthu&s;ia&s;m, or ca&s;ual inci|dents,
<PB N="115" REF="118">
directed the Poet's &s;train. In the progre&s;s of Society and Arts, they began to a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e different regular forms, and to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e different names un|der which we now know them. But in the fir&s;t rude &s;tate of Poetical Effu&s;ions, we can ea&s;ily di&s;cern the &s;eeds and beginnings of all the kinds of regular Poetry. Odes and hymns of every &s;ort, would naturally be among the fir&s;t compo&s;itions; according as the Bards were moved by religious feelings, by ex|ultation, re&s;entment, love, or any other warm &s;entiment, to pour them&s;elves forth in Song. Plaintive or Elegiac Poetry, would as natu|rally ari&s;e from lamentations over their de|cea&s;ed friends. The recital of the atchieve|ments of their heroes, and their ance&s;tors, gave birth to what we now call Epic Poetry; and as not content with &s;imply reciting the&s;e, they would infallibly be led, at &s;ome of their public meetings, to repre&s;ent them, by intro|ducing different Bards &s;peaking in the charac|ter of their heroes, and an&s;wering each other, we find in this the fir&s;t outlines of Tragedy, or Dramatic Writing.</P>
<P>NONE of the&s;e kinds of Poetry, however, were in the fir&s;t ages of Society properly di&s;|tingui&s;hed or &s;eparated, as they are now, from each other. Indeed, not only were the dif|ferent kinds of Poetry then mixed together, but all that we now call Letters, or Compo|&s;ition of any kind, was then blended in one ma&s;s. At fir&s;t, Hi&s;tory, Eloquence, and Poe|try,
<PB N="116" REF="119">
were all the &s;ame. Whoever wanted to move or to per&s;uade, to inform or to enter|tain his countrymen and neighbours, what|ever was the &s;ubject, accompanied his &s;enti|ments and tales with the melody of Song. This was the ca&s;e in that period of Society, when the character and occupations of the hu&s;bandman and the builder, the warrior and the &s;tate&s;man, were united in one per&s;on. When the progre&s;s of Society brought on a &s;eparation of the different Arts and Profe&s;&s;i|ons of Civil Life, it led al&s;o by degrees to a &s;eparation of the different literary provinces from each other.</P>
<P>THE Art of Writing was in proce&s;s of time invented; records of pa&s;t tran&s;actions began to be kept; men, occupied with the &s;ubjects of policy and u&s;eful arts, wi&s;hed now to be in&s;tructed and informed, as well as moved. They rea&s;oned and reflected upon the affairs of life; and were intere&s;ted by what was real, not fabulous, in pa&s;t tran&s;actions. The Hi&s;torian, therefore, now laid a&s;ide the bu&s;|kins of Poetry; he wrote in Pro&s;e, and at|tempted to give a faithful and judicious rela|tion of former events. The Philo&s;opher ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly to the under&s;tanding. The Orator &s;tudied to per&s;uade by rea&s;oning, and retained more or le&s;s of the antient pa&s;|&s;ionate, and glowing Style, according as it was conducive to his purpo&s;e. Poetry be|came now a &s;eparate art, calculated chiefly to plea&s;e, and confined generally to &s;uch &s;ub|jects
<PB N="117" REF="120">
as related to the imagination and pa&s;&s;ions. Even its earlie&s;t companion, Mu&s;ic, was in a great mea&s;ure divided from it.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eparations brought all the literary arts into a more regular form, and contributed to the exact and accurate cultivation of each. Poetry; however, in its antient original con|dition, was perhaps more vigorous than it is in its modern &s;tate. It included then, the whole bur&s;t of the human mind; the whole exertion of its imaginative faculties. It &s;poke then the language of pa&s;&s;ion, and no other; for to pa&s;&s;ion, it owed its birth. Prompted and in&s;pired by objects, which to him &s;eemed great, by events which intere&s;ted his country or his friends, the early Bard aro&s;e and &s;ung. He &s;ung indeed in wild and di&s;orderly &s;trains; but they were the native effu&s;ions of his heart; they were the ardent conceptions of admirati|on or re&s;entment, of &s;orrow or friend&s;hip, which he poured forth. It is no wonder, therefore, that in the rude and artle&s;s &s;train of the fir&s;t Poetry of all nations, we &s;hould often find &s;omewhat that captivates and tran|&s;ports the mind. In after ages, when Poetry became a regular art, &s;tudied for reputation and for gain, Authors began to affect what they did not feel. Compo&s;ing coolly in their clo&s;ets, they endeavoured to imitate pa&s;&s;ion, rather than to expre&s;s it; they tried to force their imagination into raptures, or to &s;upply the defect of native warmth, by tho&s;e artificial ornaments which might give Compo&s;ition a &s;plendid appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">
THE &s;eparation of Mu&s;ic from Poetry, produced con&s;equences not favourable in &s;ome re&s;pects to Poetry, and in many re&s;pects hurtful to Mu&s;ic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Dr. Brown's Di&s;&s;ertation on the <HI>Ri&s;e, Union, and Separation of Poetry and Mu&s;ic.</HI></NOTE>. As long as they remained united, Mu&s;ic enlivened and animated Poe|try, and Poetry gave force and expre&s;&s;ion to mu&s;ical &s;ound. The Mu&s;ic of that early period was beyond doubt, extremely &s;imple; and mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of &s;uch pa|thetic notes, as the voice could adapt to the words of the Song. Mu&s;ical in&s;truments, &s;uch as flutes, and pipes, and a lyre with a very few &s;trings, appear to have been early invented among &s;ome nations; but no more was intended by the&s;e in&s;truments, than &s;im|ply to accompany the voice, and to heighten the melody of Song. The Poet's &s;train was always heard; and, from many circum|&s;tances, it appears that among the antient Greeks, as well as among other nations, the Bard &s;ung his ver&s;es, and played upon his harp or lyre at the &s;ame time. In this &s;tate, the art of Mu&s;ic was, when it produced all tho&s;e great effects, of which we read &s;o much in an ancient &s;tory. And certain it is, that from &s;imple Mu&s;ic only, and from Mu&s;ic ac|companied with Ver&s;e or Song, we are to look for &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion, and powerful in|fluence over the human mind. When in&s;tru|mental Mu&s;ic came to be &s;tudied as a &s;epa|rate art, dive&s;ted of the Poet's Song, and
<PB N="119" REF="122">
formed into the artificial and intricate combi|nations of harmony, it lo&s;t all its ancient power of inflaming the hearers with &s;trong emotions; and &s;unk into an art of mere amu&s;ement, among poli&s;hed and luxurious nations.</P>
<P>STILL, however, Poetry pre&s;erves, in all countries, &s;ome remains of its fir&s;t and ori|ginal connection with Mu&s;ic. By being uttered in Song, it was formed into numbers, or into an artificial arrangement of words and &s;yllables, very different in different coun|tries; but &s;uch, as to the inhabitants of each, &s;eemed mo&s;t melodious and agreeable in &s;ound. Whence ari&s;es that great characte|ri&s;tic of Poetry which we now call Ver&s;e; a &s;ubject which comes next to be treated of.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;ubject of a curious nature; but as I am &s;en&s;ible, that were I to pur&s;ue it as far as my inclination leads, it would give ri&s;e to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which the greater part of Readers would con&s;ider as minute, I &s;hall confine my|&s;elf to a few ob&s;ervations upon Engli&s;h Ver|&s;ification.</P>
<P>NATIONS, who&s;e language and pronun|ciation were of a mu&s;ical kind, re&s;ted their Ver&s;ification chiefly upon the quantities, that is, the length or &s;hortne&s;s of their &s;yllables. Others, who did not make the quantities of their &s;yllables be &s;o di&s;tinctly perceived in pronouncing them, re&s;ted the melody of their
<PB N="120" REF="123">
Ver&s;e upon the number of &s;yllables it con|tained, upon the proper di&s;po&s;ition of ac|cents and pau&s;es in it, and frequently upon that return of corre&s;ponding &s;ounds, which we call Rhyme. The former was the ca&s;e with the Greeks and Romans; the latter is the ca&s;e with us, and with mo&s;t modern na|tions. Among the Greeks and Romans, every &s;yllable, or the far greate&s;t number at lea&s;t, was known to have a fixed and deter|mined quantity; and their manner of pro|nouncing rendered this &s;o &s;en&s;ible to the ear, that a long &s;yllable was counted preci&s;ely equal in time to two &s;hort ones. Upon this principle, the number of &s;yllables contained in their hexameter ver&s;e was allowed to vary. It may extend to 17; it can contain, when regular, no fewer than 13: but the mu&s;ical time was, notwith&s;tanding, preci&s;ely the &s;ame in every hexameter ver&s;e, and was always equal to that of 12 long &s;yllables. In order to a&s;certain the regular time of every ver&s;e, and the proper mixture and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yllables which ought to compo&s;e it, were invented, what the Gram|marians call Metrical Feet, Dactyles, Spon|dees, Iambus, &amp;c. By the&s;e mea&s;ures was tried the accuracy of Compo&s;ition in every line, and whether is was &s;o con&s;tructed as to fulfil its proper melody. It was requi&s;ite, for in&s;tance, that the hexameter ver&s;e &s;hould have the quantity of its &s;yllables &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that it could be &s;canned or mea&s;ured by &s;ix metrical feet, which might be either Dactyles
<PB N="121" REF="124">
or Spondees (as the mu&s;ical time of both the&s;e is the &s;ame), with this re&s;triction only, that the fifth foot was regularly to be a Dactyle, and the la&s;t a &s;pondee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Some writers imagine, that the feet in Latin Ver&s;e were intended to corre&s;pond to bars in Mu&s;ic, and to form mu&s;ical intervals or di&s;tinctions, &s;en&s;ible to the ear in the pronunciation of the line. Had this been the ca&s;e, every kind of Ver&s;e mu&s;t have had a peculiar order of feet appro|priated to it. But the common pro&s;odies &s;how, that there are &s;everal forms of Latin Ver&s;e which are capable of being mea&s;ured indifferently, by a &s;eries of feet of very different kinds. For in&s;tance, what is called the A&s;clepedoean Ver&s;e (in which the fir&s;t Ode of Horace is written) may be &s;canned either by a Spondeus, two Choriambus's, and a Pyrrichius; or by a Spondeus, a Dactylus &s;ucceeded by a Cae&s;ura, and two Dactylus's. The common Pentameter, and &s;ome other forms of Ver&s;e, admit the like varieties; and yet the melody of the Ver&s;e remains always the &s;ame, though it be &s;canned by different feet. This proves, that the metrical feet were not &s;en&s;ible in the pronunciation of the line, but were intended only to regulate its con&s;tructi|on; or applied as mea&s;ures, to try whether the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long and &s;hort &s;yllables was &s;uch as &s;uited the melody of the Ver&s;e: and as feet of different kinds could &s;ometimes be applied for this purpo&s;e, hence it happened, that &s;ome forms of Ver&s;e were capable of being &s;canned in different ways. For mea&s;uring the hexameter line, no other feet were found &s;o proper as Dactyles and Spondees, and therefore by the&s;e it is uniformly &s;canned. But no ear is &s;en&s;ible of the termi|nation of each foot, in reading an hexameter line. From a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of this matter, I apprehend that confu&s;ion has &s;ometimes ari&s;en among Writers, in treating of the pro|&s;ody both of Latin, and of Engli&s;h Ver&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE introduction of the&s;e feet into Eng|li&s;h Ver&s;e, would be altogether out of place; for the genius of our language corre&s;ponds not in this re&s;pect to the Greek or Latin. I &s;ay not, that we have no regard to quantity, or to long and &s;hort, in pronouncing. Many
<PB N="122" REF="125">
words we have, e&s;pecially our words con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;yllables, where the quan|tity, or the long and &s;hort &s;yllables, are inva|riably fixed; but great numbers we have al&s;o, where the quantity is left altogether loo&s;e. This is the ca&s;e with a great part of our words con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;yllables, and with almo&s;t all our mono&s;yllables. In gene|ral, the difference made between long and &s;hort &s;yllables, in our manner of pronoun|cing them is &s;o very incon&s;iderable, and &s;o much liberty is left us for making them either long or &s;hort at plea&s;ure, that mere quantity is of very little effect in Engli&s;h Ver&s;ification. The only perceptible differ|ence among our &s;yllables, ari&s;es from &s;ome of them being uttered with that &s;tronger per|cu&s;&s;ion of voice, which we call Accent. This Accent, does not always make the &s;yllable longer, but gives it more force of &s;ound only: and it is upon a certain order and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of accented and unaccented &s;yllables, infi|nitely more than upon their being long or &s;hort, that the melody of our Ver&s;e depends. If we take any of Mr. Pope's lines, and in reciting them alter the quantity of the &s;yl|lables, as far as our quantities are &s;en&s;ible, the Mu&s;ic of the Ver&s;e will not be much in|jured: whereas, if we do not accent the &s;yl|lables according as the ver&s;e dictates, its me|lody will be totally de&s;troyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See this well illu&s;trated in Lord Monboddo's Treati&s;e of <HI>the Origin and Progre&s;s of Language,</HI> Vol. II. under the head of the Pro&s;ody of language. He &s;hows that this is not only the con&s;titution of our own Ver&s;e, but that by our manner of reading Latin Ver&s;e, we make its Mu&s;ic nearly the &s;ame. For we certainly do not pronounce it according to the ancient quantities, &s;o as to make the mu&s;ical time of one long &s;yllable equal to two &s;hort ones; but according to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of accented and unaccented &s;yllables, only mixed in a ratio different from that of our own Ver&s;e. No Ro|man could po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand our pronunciation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="126">
OUR Engli&s;h Heroic Ver&s;e is of what may be called an Iambic &s;tructure; that is, com|po&s;ed of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion nearly alternate of &s;ylla|bles, not &s;hort and long, but unaccented and accented. With regard to the place of the&s;e accents, however, &s;ome liberty is admitted, for the &s;ake of variety. Very often, though not always, the line begins with an unaccent|ed &s;yllable; and &s;ometimes, in the cour&s;e of it, two unaccented &s;yllables follow each other. But, in general, there are either five, or four, accented &s;yllables in each line. The number of &s;yllables is ten, unle&s;s where an Alexan|drian Ver&s;e is occa&s;ionally admitted. In Ver&s;es not Alexandrian, in&s;tances occur where the line appears to have more than the limit|ed number. But in &s;uch in&s;tances, I appre|hend it will be found, that &s;ome of the liquid &s;yllables are &s;o &s;lurred in pronouncing, as to bring the Ver&s;e, with re&s;pect to its effect upon the ear, within the u&s;ual bounds.</P>
<P>ANOTHER e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance in the con&s;titution of our Ver&s;e, is the cae&s;ural pau&s;e, which falls towards the middle of each line.
<PB N="124" REF="127">
Some pau&s;e of this kind, dictated by the me|lody, is found in the Ver&s;e of mo&s;t nations. It is found, as might be &s;hown, in the Latin hexameter. In the French heroic Ver&s;e, it is very &s;en&s;ible. That is a ver&s;e of twelve &s;yl|lables, and in every line, ju&s;t after the &s;ixth &s;yllable, there falls regularly and indi&s;pen&s;a|bly, a cae&s;ural pau&s;e, dividing the line into two equal hemi&s;tichs. For example, in the fir&s;t lines of Boileau's Epi&s;tle to the King:<Q><L>Jeune &amp; vaillant heros &verbar; dont la haute &s;age&s;&s;e</L>
<L>N'e&s;t point le fruit tardif &verbar; d'une lente vieile&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>Qui &s;eul &s;ans Mini&s;tre &verbar; &agrave; l'example des Dieux</L>
<L>Soutiens tout par toi-m&ecirc;me &verbar; &amp; vois tous par &s;es yeux.</L></Q> In this train all their Ver&s;es proceed; the one half of the line always an&s;wering to the other, and the &s;ame chime returning ince&s;|&s;antly on the ear without intermi&s;&s;ion or change; which is certainly a defect in their Ver&s;e, and unfits it &s;o very much for the freedom and dignity of Heroic Poetry. On the other hand, it is a di&s;tingui&s;hing advan|tage of our Engli&s;h Ver&s;e, that it allows the pau&s;e to be varied through four different &s;yl|lables in the line. The pau&s;e may fall after the 4th, the 5th, the 6th, or the 7th &s;yllable; and according as the pau&s;e is placed after one or other of the&s;e &s;yllables, the melody of the Ver&s;e is much changed, its air and cadence are diver&s;ified. By this means, uncommon richne&s;s and variety are added to Engli&s;h Ver|&s;ification.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128">
WHEN the pau&s;e falls earlie&s;t, that is, af|ter the 4th &s;yllable, the bri&s;ke&s;t melody is thereby formed, and the mo&s;t &s;pirited air given to the line. In the following lines of the Rape of the Lock, Mr. Pope has, with exqui&s;ite propriety, &s;uited the con&s;truction of the Ver&s;e to the &s;ubject.<Q><L>On her white brea&s;t &verbar; a &s;parkling cro&s;s &s;he wore,</L>

<L>Favours to none &verbar; to all &s;he &s;miles extends,</L>
<L>Oft &s;he rejects &verbar; but never once offends.</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEN the pau&s;e falls after the 5th &s;yllable, which divides the line into two equal porti|ons, the melody is &s;en&s;ibly altered. The Ver&s;e lo&s;es that bri&s;k and &s;prightly air, which it had with the former pau&s;e, and becomes more &s;mooth, gentle and flowing.
<Q><L>Eternal &s;un&s;hine &verbar; of the &s;potle&s;s mind,</L>
<L>Each prayer accepted &verbar; and each wi&s;h re&s;ign'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEN the pau&s;e proceeds to follow the 6th &s;yllable, the tenor of the Mu&s;ic becomes &s;olemn and grave. The ver&s;e marches now with a more &s;low and mea&s;ured pace, than in any of the two former ca&s;es.
<Q><L>The wrath of Peleus' &s;on &verbar; the direful &s;pring</L>
<L>Of all the Grecian woes &verbar; O Godde&s;s &s;ing!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">
BUT the grave, &s;olemn cadence becomes &s;till more &s;en&s;ible, when the pau&s;e falls after the 7th &s;yllable, which is the neare&s;t place to the end of the line that it can occupy. This kind of Ver&s;e occurs the &s;eldome&s;t, but has a happy effect in diver&s;ifying the melody. It produces that &s;low Alexandrian air, which is finely &s;uited to a clo&s;e; and for this rea&s;on, &s;uch lines almo&s;t never occur together, but are u&s;ed in fini&s;hing the couplet.

<P>I HAVE taken my examples from Ver&s;es in rhyme; becau&s;e in the&s;e, our Ver&s;ification is &s;ubjected to the &s;tricte&s;t law. As Blank Ver&s;e is of a freer kind, and naturally is read with le&s;s cadence or tone, the pau&s;es in it, and the effect of them, are not always &s;o &s;en&s;ible to the ear. It is con&s;tructed, how|ever, entirely upon the &s;ame principles, with re&s;pect to the place of the pau&s;e. There are &s;ome, who, in order to exalt the variety and the power of our Heroic Ver&s;e, have main|tained that it admits of mu&s;ical pau&s;es, not only after tho&s;e four &s;yllables, where I a&s;&s;ign|ed their place, but after any one &s;yllable in the Ver&s;e indifferently, where the &s;en&s;e directs it to be placed. This, in my opinion, is the &s;ame thing as to maintain that there is no pau&s;e at all belonging to the natural melody of the Ver&s;e; &s;ince, according to this notion, the pau&s;e is formed entirely by the meaning,

Marmontel, in his Po&euml;tique Fran|&ccedil;oi&s;e, Vol. I. p. 269, takes notice, that this con&s;truction of Ver&s;e is common to the Italians and the Engli&s;h; and de|fends the uniformity of the French cae&s;ural pau&s;e upon this ground, that the alteration of ma&s;culine and feminine rhymes, furni&s;hes &s;ufficient variety to the French Poetry; whereas the change of movement, occa&s;ioned by the four different pau&s;es in Engli&s;h and Italian Ver&s;e, produces, ac|cording to him, too great diver&s;ity.

<P>OUR Blank Ver&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great advanta|ges, and is indeed a noble, bold, and di&s;en|cumbered &s;pecies of Ver&s;ification. The prin|cipal defect in rhyme, is the full clo&s;e which it forces upon the ear, at the end of every
<PB N="128" REF="131">
couplet. Blank Ver&s;e is freed from this; and allows the lines to run into each other with as great liberty as the Latin hexameter per|mits, perhaps with greater. Hence it is par|ticularly &s;uited to &s;ubjects of dignity and force, which demand more free and manly numbers than rhyme. The con&s;traint and &s;trict regularity of rhyme are unfavourable to the &s;ublime, or to the highly pathetic &s;train. An Epic Poem, or a Tragedy, would be fet|tered and degraded by it. It is be&s;t adapted to compo&s;itions of a temperate &s;train, where no particular vehemence is required in the &s;entiments, nor great &s;ublimity in the Style; &s;uch as Pa&s;torals, Elegies, Epi&s;tles, Satyres, &amp;c. To the&s;e, it communicates that degree of elevation which is proper for them; and without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ufficiently di&s;|tingui&s;hes the Style from Pro&s;e. He who &s;hould write &s;uch Poems in Blank Ver&s;e, would render his work har&s;h and unplea&s;ing. In order to &s;upport a poetical Style, he would be obliged to affect a pomp of language un|&s;uitable to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THOUGH I join in opinion with tho&s;e, who think that Rhyme finds its proper place in the middle, but not in the higher regions of Poetry, I can by no means join in the in|vectives which &s;ome have poured out again&s;t it, as if it were a mere barbarous gingling of &s;ounds, fit only for children, and owing to nothing but the corruption of ta&s;te in the monki&s;h ages. Rhyme might indeed be bar|barous
<PB N="129" REF="132">
in Latin or Greek Ver&s;e, becau&s;e the&s;e languages, by the &s;onorou&s;ne&s;s of their words, by their liberty of tran&s;po&s;ition and inver&s;ion, by their fixed quantities and mu&s;i|cal pronunciation, could carry on the melody of Ver&s;e without its aid. But it does not follow, that therefore it mu&s;t be barbarous in the Engli&s;h language, which is de&s;titute of the&s;e advantages. Every language has powers and graces, and mu&s;ic peculiar to it&s;elf; and what is becoming in one, would be ridicu|lous in another. Rhyme was barbarous in Latin; and an attempt to con&s;truct Engli&s;h Ver&s;es, after the form of hexameters, and pentameters, and Sapphics, is as barbarous among us. It is not true, that rhyme is merely a monki&s;h invention. On the con|trary, it has obtained under different forms, in the Ver&s;ification of mo&s;t known nations. It is found in the Ancient Poetry of the nor|thern nations of Europe; it is &s;aid to be found among the Arabs, the Per&s;ians, the Indians, and the Americans. This &s;hows that there is &s;omething in the return of &s;imi|lar &s;ounds, which is grateful to the ears of mo&s;t part of mankind. And if any one, after reading Mr. Pope's Rape of the Lock, or Eloi&s;a to Abelard, &s;hall not admit our rhyme, with all its varieties of pau&s;es, to carry both elegance, and &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ound, his ear mu&s;t be pronounced to be of a very peculiar kind.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133">
THE pre&s;ent form of our Engli&s;h heroic rhyme in couplets, is a modern &s;pecies of Ver&s;ification. The mea&s;ure generally u&s;ed in the days of Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles I. was the &s;tanza of eight lines, &s;uch as Spencer employs, borrowed from the Italian; a mea&s;ure very con&s;trained and artificial. Waller was the fir&s;t who brought couplets into vogue; and Dryden afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed the u&s;age. Waller fir&s;t &s;moothed our Ver&s;e; Dryden perfected it. Mr. Pope's Ver&s;ification has a peculiar charac|ter. It is flowing and &s;mooth, in the highe&s;t degree; far more laboured and correct than that of any who went before him. He in|troduced one con&s;iderable change into Heroic Ver&s;e, by totally throwing a&s;ide the triplets, or three lines rhyming together, in which Mr. Dryden abounded. Dryden's Ver&s;ification, however, has very great merit; and, like all his productions, has much &s;pirit, mixed with carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. If not &s;o &s;mooth and correct as Pope's, it is however more varied and ea&s;y. He &s;ubjects him&s;elf le&s;s to the rule of clo&s;ing the &s;en&s;e with the couplet; and frequently takes the liberty of making his couplets run into one another, with &s;omewhat of the free|dom of Blank Ver&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XXXIX. PASTORAL POETRY&mdash;LYRIC POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t Lecture, I gave an account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Poetry, and made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the nature of Engli&s;h Ver&s;ification. I now proceed to treat of the chief kinds of Poetical Compo&s;ition; and of the critical rules that relate to them. I &s;hall follow that order, which is mo&s;t &s;imple and natural; beginning with the le&s;&s;er forms of Poetry, and a&s;cending from them to the Epic and Dramatic, as the mo&s;t dignified. This Lecture &s;hall be employed on Pa&s;toral, and Lyric Poetry.</P>
<P>THOUGH I begin with the con&s;ideration of Pa&s;toral Poetry, it is not becau&s;e I con&s;ider it as one of the earlie&s;t forms of Poetical Compo&s;ition. On the contrary, I am of opinion that it was not cultivated as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, or &s;ubject of Writing, until Society
<PB N="132" REF="135">
had advanced in refinement. Mo&s;t Authors have indeed indulged the fancy, that becau&s;e the life which mankind at fir&s;t led was rural, therefore, their fir&s;t Poetry was Pa&s;toral, or employed in the celebration of rural &s;cenes and objects. I make no doubt, that it would borrow many of its images and allu&s;ions, from tho&s;e natural objects with which men were be&s;t acquainted; but I make as little doubt, that the calm and tranquil &s;cenes of rural fe|licity were not, by any means, the fir&s;t objects which in&s;pired that &s;train of Compo&s;ition, which we now call Poetry. It was in&s;pired, in the fir&s;t periods of every nation, by events and objects which rou&s;ed men's pa&s;&s;ions; or, at lea&s;t, awakened their wonder and admira|tion. The actions of their Gods and Heroes, their own exploits in war, the &s;ucce&s;&s;es or misfortunes of their countrymen and friends, furni&s;hed the fir&s;t Themes to the Bards of every country. What was of a Pa&s;toral kind in their Compo&s;itions, was incidental only. They did not think of choo&s;ing for their Theme, the tranquillity and the plea&s;ures of the country, as long as the&s;e were daily and familiar objects to them. It was not till men had begun to be a&s;&s;embled in great cities, after the di&s;tinctions of rank and &s;tation were formed, and the bu&s;tle of Courts and large Societies was known, that Pa&s;toral Poetry a&s;&s;umed its pre&s;ent form. Men then began to look back upon the more &s;imple and inno|cent life, which their forefathers led, or which, at lea&s;t, they fancied them to have led: they
<PB N="133" REF="136">
looked back upon it with plea&s;ure; and in tho&s;e rural &s;cenes, and pa&s;toral occupations, ima|gining a degree of felicity to take place, &s;upe|rior to what they now enjoyed, conceived the idea of celebrating it in Poetry. It was in the court of King Ptolomy, that Theocritus wrote the fir&s;t Pa&s;torals with which we are ac|quainted; and, in the court of Augu&s;tus, he was imitated by Virgil.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may have been the origin of Pa&s;toral Poetry, it is, undoubtedly, a natural, and very agreeable form of Poetical Compo|&s;ition. It recalls to our imagination, tho&s;e gay &s;cenes, and plea&s;ing views of nature, which commonly are the delight of our child|hood and youth; and to which, in more ad|vanced years, the greate&s;t part of men recur with plea&s;ure. It exhibits to us a life, with which we are accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ociate the ideas of peace, of lei&s;ure, and of innocence; and, therefore, we readily &s;et open our heart to &s;uch repre&s;entations as promi&s;e to bani&s;h from our thoughts the cares of the world, and to tran&s;port us into calm Ely&s;ian regions. At the &s;ame time, no &s;ubject bids fairer for being favourable to Poetry. Amid&s;t rural objects, nature pre&s;ents, on all hands, the fine&s;t field for de&s;cription; and nothing appears to flow more, of its own accord, into Poetical Num|bers, than rivers and mountains, meadows and hills, flocks and trees, and &s;hepherds void of care. Hence, this &s;pecies of Poetry has, at all times, allured many Readers, and ex|cited
<PB N="134" REF="137">
many Writers. But, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e advantages it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it will appear, from what I have farther to ob&s;erve upon it, that there is hardly any &s;pecies of Poetry which is more difficult to be carried to perfec|tion, or in which few Writers have excelled.</P>
<P>PASTORAL life may be con&s;idered in three different views; either &s;uch as it now actual|ly is; when the &s;tate of Shepherds is reduced to be a mean, &s;ervile, and laborious &s;tate; when their employments are become di&s;agree|able, and their ideas gro&s;s and low: or &s;uch as we may &s;uppo&s;e it once to have been, in the more early and &s;imple ages, when it was a life of ea&s;e and abundance; when the wealth of men con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in flocks and herds, and the Shepherd, though unrefined in his manners, was re&s;pectable in his &s;tate: or, la&s;tly, &s;uch as it never was, and never can in reality be, when, to the ea&s;e, innocence, and &s;implicity of the early ages, we attempt to add the poli&s;hed ta&s;te, and cultivated manners, of modern times. Of the&s;e three &s;tates, the fir&s;t is too gro&s;s and mean, the la&s;t too refined and unnatural, to be made the ground-work of Pa&s;toral Poetry. Either of the&s;e extremes is a rock upon which the Poet will &s;plit, if he approach too near it. We &s;hall be di&s;gu&s;ted if he give us too much of the &s;ervile employments, and low ideas of actual pea&s;ants, as Theocritus is cen&s;ured for having &s;ometimes done; and if, like &s;ome of the French and Italian Writers
<PB N="135" REF="138">
of Pa&s;torals, he makes his Shepherds di&s;|cour&s;e as if they were courtiers and &s;cholars, he then retains the name only, but wants the &s;pirit of Pa&s;toral Poetry.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t, therefore, keep in the middle &s;tation between the&s;e. He mu&s;t form to him|&s;elf the idea of a rural &s;tate, &s;uch as in certain periods of Society may have actually taken place, where there was ea&s;e, equality, and innocence; where Shepherds were gay and agreeable, without being learned or refined; and plain and artle&s;s, without being gro&s;s and wretched. The great charm of Pa&s;toral Poe|try ari&s;es, from the view which it exhibits of the tranquillity and happine&s;s of a rural life. This plea&s;ing illu&s;ion, therefore, the Poet mu&s;t carefully maintain. He mu&s;t di&s;play, to us, all that is agreeable in that &s;tate, but hide whatever is di&s;plea&s;ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the following beautiful lines of the Fir&s;t Ecologue, Virgil has, in the true &s;pirit of a Pa&s;toral Poet, brought to|gether as agreeable an a&s;&s;emblage of images of rural plea|&s;ure as can any where be found.

&s;implicity and innocence to the full; but cover its rudene&s;s and mi&s;ery. Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in|deed, and anxieties he may attribute to it; for it would be perfectly unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e any condition of human life to be without them; but they mu&s;t be of &s;uch a nature, as not to &s;hock the fancy with any thing peculi|arly di&s;gu&s;ting in the pa&s;toral life. The Shepherd may well be afflicted for the di&s;|plea&s;ure of his mi&s;tre&s;s, or for the lo&s;s of a favourite lamb. It is a &s;ufficient recommen|dation of any &s;tate, to have only &s;uch evils as the&s;e to deplore. In &s;hort, it is the pa&s;toral life &s;omewhat embelli&s;hed and beautified, at lea&s;t, &s;een on its faire&s;t &s;ide only, that the Poet ought to pre&s;ent to us. But let him take care, that, in embelli&s;hing nature, he does not altogether di&s;gui&s;e her; or pretend to join with rural &s;implicity and happine&s;s, &s;uch improvements as are unnatural and foreign to it. If it be not exactly real life which he pre&s;ents to us, it mu&s;t, however, be &s;ome|what that re&s;embles it. This, in my opinion, is the general idea of Pa&s;toral Poetry. But, in order to examine it more particularly, let us con&s;ider, fir&s;t, the &s;cenery; next, the cha|racters; and la&s;tly, the &s;ubjects and actions, which this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition &s;hould ex|hibit.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="140">
As to the Scene, it is clear, that it mu&s;t always be laid in the country, and much of the Poet's merit depends on de&s;cribing it beautifully. Virgil is, in this re&s;pect, excell|ed by Theocritus, who&s;e de&s;criptions of na|tural beauties are richer, and more picture&s;que than tho&s;e of the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">What rural &s;cenery, for in&s;tance, can be painted in more lively colours, than the following de&s;cription exhibits?

a &s;cene, or rural pro&s;pect, &s;hould be di&s;tinct|ly drawn, and &s;et before us. It is not enough, that we have tho&s;e unmeaning groupes of violets and ro&s;es, of birds, and brooks, and breezes, which our common Pa&s;toral-mongers throw together, and which are perpetually recurring upon us without variation.

It is al&s;o incumbent on him, to &s;uit the &s;cenery to the &s;ubject of the Pa&s;toral; and, according as it is of a gay or a melancholy kind, to exhibit nature under &s;uch forms as may corre&s;pond with the emotions or &s;enti|ments which he de&s;cribes.

<P>WITH regard to the characters, or per&s;ons, which are proper to be introduced into Pa&s;|torals, it is not enough that they be per&s;ons re&s;iding in the country. The adventures, or the di&s;cour&s;es of courtiers, or citizens, in the country, are not what we look for in &s;uch Writings; we expect to be entertained by Shepherds, or per&s;ons wholly engaged in ru|ral occupations; who&s;e innocence and free|dom from the cares of the world may, in
<PB N="140" REF="143">
our imagination, form an agreeable contra&s;t, with the manners and characters of tho&s;e who are engaged in the bu&s;tle of life.</P>
<P>ONE of the principal difficulties which here occurs has been already hinted; that of keeping the exact medium between too much ru&s;ticity on the one hand, and too much re|&s;inement on the other. The Shepherd, a&s;&s;uredly, mu&s;t be plain and unaffected in his manner of thinking, on all &s;ubjects. An amiable &s;implicity mu&s;t be the ground-work of his character. At the &s;ame time, there is no nece&s;&s;ity for his being dull and in&s;ipid. He may have good &s;en&s;e and reflection; he may have &s;prightline&s;s and vivacity; he may have very tender and delicate feelings; &s;ince the&s;e are, more or le&s;s, the portion of men in all ranks of life; and &s;ince, undoubtedly, there was much genius in the world, before there were learning, or arts to refine it. But then he mu&s;t not &s;ubtili&s;e; he mu&s;t not deal in general reflections, and ab&s;tract rea&s;oning; and &s;till le&s;s in the points and conceits of an affected gallantry, which &s;urely belong not to his character and &s;ituation. Some of the&s;e conceits are the chief blemi&s;hes of the Italian Pa&s;torals, which are otherwi&s;e beautiful. When Aminta, in Ta&s;&s;o, is di&s;entangling his mi&s;tre&s;s's hair from a tree to which a Savage had bound it, he is repre&s;ented as &s;aying: <Q REND="inline">"Cruel tree! how could&s;t thou injure that lovely hair which did thee &s;o much ho|nour? thy rugged trunk was not worthy

This is <HI>naive,</HI> as the French expre&s;s it, and perfectly &s;uited to Pa&s;toral Manners. Mr. Pope wanted to imitate this pa&s;&s;age, and, as he thought, to improve upon it. He does it thus:<Q><L>The &s;prightly Sylvia trips along the green,</L>
<L>She runs; but hopes &s;he does not run un&s;een;</L>
<L>While a kind glance at her pur&s;uer &s;lies,</L>

<P>SUPPOSING the Poet to have formed cor|rect ideas concerning his Pa&s;toral characters and per&s;onages; the next enquiry is, about what is he to employ them? and what are to be the &s;ubjects of his Eclogues? For it is not enough, that he gives us Shepherds di&s;cour&s;|ing together. Every good Poem, of every kind, ought to have a &s;ubject which would, in &s;ome way, intere&s;t us. Now, here, I ap|prehend, lies the chief difficulty of Pa&s;toral
<PB N="143" REF="146">
Writing. The active &s;cenes of country life either are, or to mo&s;t de&s;cribers appear to be, too barren of incidents. The &s;tate of a Shep|herd, or a per&s;on occupied in rural employ|ments only, is expo&s;ed to few of tho&s;e acci|dents and revolutions which render his &s;itua|tion intere&s;ting, or produce curio&s;ity or &s;ur|pri&s;e. The tenor of his life is uniform. His ambition is conceived to be without policy, and his love without intrigue. Hence it is, that, of all Poems, the mo&s;t meagre com|monly in the &s;ubject, and the lea&s;t diver&s;ified in the &s;train, is the Pa&s;toral. From the fir&s;t lines, we can, generally, gue&s;s at all that is to follow. It is either a Shepherd who &s;its down &s;olitary by a brook, to lament the ab|&s;ence, or cruelty of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and to tell us how the trees wither, and the flowers droop, now that &s;he is gone; or we have two &s;hepherds who challenge one another to &s;ing, rehear&s;ing alternate ver&s;es, which have little either of meaning or &s;ubject, till the Judge rewards one with a &s;tudded crook, and another with a beechen bowl. To the fre|quent repetition of common-place topics, of this &s;ort, which have been thrummed over by all Eclogue Writers &s;ince the days of The|ocritus and Virgil, is owing much of that in&s;ipidity which prevails in Pa&s;toral Compo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>I MUCH que&s;tion, however, whether this in&s;ipidity be not owing to the fault of the Poets, and to their barren and &s;lavi&s;h imita|tion
<PB N="144" REF="147">
of the ancient pa&s;toral topics, rather than to the confined nature of the &s;ubject. For why may not Pa&s;toral Poetry take a wider range? Human nature, and human pa&s;&s;ions, are much the &s;ame in every rank of life; and wherever the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions operate on objects that are within the rural &s;phere, there may be a proper &s;ubject for pa&s;toral. One would indeed choo&s;e to remove from this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition the operations of violent and direful pa&s;&s;ions, and to pre&s;ent &s;uch only as are con&s;i&s;tent with innocence, &s;implicity, and virtue. But under this limitation, there will &s;till be abundant &s;cope for a careful ob|&s;erver of nature to exert his genius. The various adventures which give occa&s;ion to tho&s;e engaged in country life to di&s;play their di&s;po&s;ition and temper; the &s;cenes of dome&s;|tic felicity or di&s;quiet; the attachment of friends and of brothers; the rival&s;hip and competitions of lovers; the unexpected &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es or misfortunes of families, might give occa&s;ion to many a plea&s;ing and tender in|cident; and were more of the narrative and &s;entimental intermixed with the de&s;criptive in this kind of Poetry, it would become much more intere&s;ting than it now generally is, to the bulk of readers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The above ob&s;ervations on the barrenne&s;s of the com|mon Eclogues, were written before any tran&s;lation from the German had made us acquainted in this country with Ge&s;|ner's Idylls, in which the ideas that had occurred to me for the improvement of Pa&s;toral Poetry, are fully realized.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148">
THE two great fathers of Pa&s;toral Poetry are, Theocritus, and Virgil. Theocritus was a Sicilian; and as he has laid the &s;cenes of his Eclogues in his own country, Sicily be|came ever afterwards a &s;ort of con&s;ecrated ground for Pa&s;toral Poetry. His Idyllia, as he has entitled them, are not all of equal merit; nor indeed are they all pa&s;torals; but &s;ome of them poems of a quite different na|ture. In &s;uch, however, as are properly pa&s;|torals, there are many and great beauties. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed for the &s;implicity of his &s;enti|ments; for the great &s;weetne&s;s and harmony of his numbers, and for the richne&s;s of his &s;cenery and de&s;cription. He is the original, of which Virgil is the imitator. For mo&s;t of Virgil's highe&s;t beauties in his Eclogues are copied from Theocritus; in many places he has done nothing more than tran&s;late him. He mu&s;t be allowed, however, to have imi|tated him with great judgment, and in &s;ome re&s;pects to have improved upon him. For Theocritus, it cannot be denied, de&s;cends &s;ometimes into ideas that are gro&s;s and mean, and makes his &s;hepherds abu&s;ive and immo|de&s;t; whereas Virgil is free from offen&s;ive ru&s;ticity, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erves the character of pa&s;toral &s;implicity. The &s;ame di&s;tinction obtains between Theocritus and Virgil, as between many other of the Greek and Roman Writers. The Greek led the way, followed nature more clo&s;ely, and &s;hewed more original genius. The Roman di&s;covered more of the poli&s;h, and correctne&s;s
<PB N="146" REF="149">
of art. We have a few remains of other two Greek Poets in the Pa&s;toral Style, Mo&s;|chus and Bion, which have very con&s;iderable merit; and if they want the &s;implicity of Theocritus, excel him in tenderne&s;s and delicacy.</P>
<P>THE Modern Writers of Pa&s;torals have, generally contented them&s;elves with copying, or imitating, the de&s;criptions and &s;entiments of the ancient Poets. Sannazarius, indeed, a famous Latin Poet, in the age of Leo X. attempted a bold innovation. He compo&s;ed Pi&s;catory Eclogues; changing the &s;cene from Woods to the Sea, and from the life of Shep|herds to that of Fi&s;hermen. But the innova|tion was &s;o unhappy, that he has gained no followers. For the life of Fi&s;hermen is, ob|viou&s;ly, much more hard and toil&s;ome than that of Shepherds, and pre&s;ents to the fancy much le&s;s agreeable images. Flocks, and trees, and flowers, are objects of greater beauty, and more generally reli&s;hed by men, than fi&s;hes and marine productions. Of all the Moderns, M. Ge&s;ner, a Poet, of Swit|zerland, has been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in his Pa&s;toral Compo&s;itions. He has introduced into his Idylls (as he entitles them) many new ideas. His rural &s;cenery is often &s;trik|ing, and his de&s;criptions are lively. He pre|&s;ents pa&s;toral life to us, with all the embel|li&s;hments of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible; but without any exce&s;s of refinement. What forms the chief merit of this Poet, is, that
<PB N="147" REF="150">
he writes to the heart; and has enriched the &s;ubjects of his Idylls with incidents, which give ri&s;e to much tender &s;entiment. Scenes of dome&s;tic felicity are beautifully painted. The mutual affection of hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as well as of lovers, are di&s;played in a plea&s;ing and touching manner. From not under&s;tand|ing the language in which M. Ge&s;ner writes, I can be no judge of the Poetry of his Style: but, in the &s;ubject and conduct of his Pa&s;|torals, he appears to me, to have outdone all the Moderns.</P>
<P>NEITHER Mr. Pope's nor Mr. Philips's Pa&s;|torals, do any great honour to the Engli&s;h Poe|try. Mr. Pope's were compo&s;ed in his youth; which may be an apology for other faults, but cannot well excu&s;e the barrenne&s;s that appears in them. They are written in re|markably &s;mooth and flowing numbers: and this is their chief merit; for there is &s;carcely any thought in them which can be called his own; &s;carcely any de&s;cription, or any image of nature, which has the marks of being ori|ginal, or copied from nature her&s;elf; but a repetition of the common images that are to be found in Virgil, and in all Poets who write of rural themes. Philips attempted to be more &s;imple and natural than Pope; but he wanted genius to &s;upport his attempt, or to write agreeably. He, too, runs on the common and beaten topics; and endeavour|ing to be &s;imple, he becomes flat and in&s;ipid.
<PB N="148" REF="151">
There was no &s;mall competition between the&s;e two Authors, at the time when their Pa&s;torals were publi&s;hed. In &s;ome papers of the <HI>Guardian,</HI> great partiality was &s;hown, to Philips, and high prai&s;e be&s;towed upon him. Mr. Pope, re&s;enting this preference, under a feigned name procured a Paper to be in&s;erted in the <HI>Guardian,</HI> wherein he &s;eemingly car|ries on the plan of extolling Philips; but in reality &s;atiri&s;es him mo&s;t &s;everely with ironical prai&s;es; and in an artful covered manner, gives the palm to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Guardian, No. 40.</NOTE>. About the &s;ame time, Mr. Gay publi&s;hed his Shepherd's Week, in Six Pa&s;torals, which are de&s;igned to ridicule that &s;ort of &s;implicity which Philips and his partizans extolled, and are, indeed, an ingenious burle&s;que of Pa&s;toral Writing, when it ri&s;es no higher than the manners of modern clowns and ru&s;tics. Mr. Shen&s;tone's Pa&s;toral Ballad, in four parts, may ju&s;tly be reckoned, I think, one of the mo&s;t elegant Poems of this kind, which we have in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet mentioned one form in which Pa&s;toral Writing has appeared in latter ages, that is, when extended into a Play, or regular Drama, where plot, characters, and pa&s;&s;ions, are joined with the &s;implicity and innocence of rural manners. This is the chief improvement which the Moderns have made
<PB N="149" REF="152">
on this &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition; and of this nature, we have two Italian Pieces which are much celebrated, Guarini's Pa&s;tor Fido, and Ta&s;&s;o's Aminta. Both of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s great beauties, and are entitled to the reputation they have gained. To the latter, the prefe|rence &s;eems due, as being le&s;s intricate in the plot and conduct, and le&s;s &s;trained and affect|ed in the &s;entiments; and though not wholly free of Italian refinement (of which I already gave one in&s;tance, the wor&s;t, indeed, that occurs in all the Poem), it is, on the whole, a performance of high merit. The &s;train of the Poetry is gentle and plea&s;ing; and the Italian Language contributes to add much of that &s;oftne&s;s, which is peculiarly &s;uited to Pa&s;toral<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><P>It may be proper to take notice here, that the charge again&s;t Ta&s;&s;o for his points and conceits, has &s;ometimes been carried too far. Mr. Addi&s;on, for in&s;tance, in a Paper of the Guardian, cen&s;uring his Aminta, gives this example, <Q REND="inline">"That Sylvia enters adorned with a garland of flowers, and after viewing her&s;elf in a fountain, breaks out in a &s;peech to the flowers on her head, and tells them, that &s;he did not wear them to adorn her&s;elf, but to make them a&s;ham|ed."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Whoever can bear this,"</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline">"may be a&s;&s;ured, that he has no ta&s;te for Pa&s;toral." <BIBL>Guard. No. 38.</BIBL></Q> But Ta&s;&s;o's Sylvia, in truth, makes no &s;uch ridiculous figure, and we are obliged to &s;u&s;pect that Mr. Addi&s;on had not read the Aminta. Daphne, a companion of Sylvia, appears in conver&s;ation with Thyr&s;is, the confidant of Aminta, Sylvia's lover, and in order to &s;hew him, that Sylvia was not &s;o &s;im|ple, or in&s;en&s;ible to her own charms, as &s;he affected to be, gives him this in&s;tance; that &s;he had caught her one day adju&s;ting her dre&s;s by a fountain, and applying now one flower, and now another to her neck; and after comparing their colours with her own, &s;he broke into a &s;mile, as if &s;he had &s;eemed to &s;ay, I will wear you, not for my ornaments, but to &s;hew how much you yield to me: and when caught thus admiring her&s;elf, &s;he threw away her flowers, and blu&s;hed for &s;hame.&mdash;This de&s;cription of the vanity of a rural coquette, is no more than what is natural, and very different from what the Author of the Guardian repre&s;ents it.</P>
<P>This cen&s;ure on Ta&s;&s;o was not originally Mr. Addi&s;on's. Bouhours, in his <HI>Mani&egrave;re de bien pen&s;er dans les ouvrages d'e&s;prit,</HI> appears to have been the fir&s;t who gave this mi&s;re|pre&s;entation of Sylvia's Speech, and founded a critici&s;m on it. Fontenelle, in his Di&s;cour&s;e on Pa&s;toral Poetry, fol|lowed him in this critici&s;m. Mr. Addi&s;on, or whoever was the Author of that Paper in the Guardian, copied from them both. Mr. Warton, in the Prefatory Di&s;cour&s;e to his Tran&s;lation of Virgil's Eclogues, repeats the ob&s;ervation. Sylvia's Speech to the flowers, with which &s;he was adorned, is always quoted as the flagrant in&s;tance of the fal&s;e ta&s;te of the Italian Poets. Whereas, Ta&s;&s;o gives us no &s;uch Speech of Sylvia's, but only informs us of what her companion &s;up|po&s;ed her to be thinking, or &s;aying to her&s;elf, when &s;he was privately admiring her own beauty. After charging &s;o many eminent Critics, for having fallen into this &s;trange inaccura|cy, from copying one another, without looking into the Author whom they cen&s;ure, it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to in&s;ert the pa&s;&s;age which has occa&s;ioned this remark. Daphne &s;peas thus to Thyr&s;is:<Q><L>Hora per dirti il ver, non mi re&s;olvo</L>

I MUST not omit the mention of another Pa&s;toral Drama, which will bear being brought into compari&s;on with any Compo&s;ition of this kind, in any language; that is, Allan Ram|&s;ay's Gentle Shepherd. It is a great di&s;ad|vantage to this beautiful Poem, that it is written in the old ru&s;tic dialect of Scotland, which, in a &s;hort time, will probably be en|tirely ob&s;olete, and not intelligible; and it is a farther di&s;advantage, that it is &s;o entirely formed on the rural manners of Scotland, that none but a native of that country can thoroughly under&s;tand, or reli&s;h it. But, though &s;ubject to tho&s;e local di&s;advantages, which confine its reputation within narrow
<PB N="151" REF="154">
limits, it is full of &s;o much natural de&s;cription, and tender &s;entiment, as would do honour to any Poet. The characters are well drawn, the incidents affecting, the &s;cenery and man|ners lively and ju&s;t. It affords a &s;trong proof, both of the power which nature and &s;implici|ty po&s;&s;e&s;s, to reach the heart in every &s;ort of
<PB N="152" REF="155">
Writing; and of the variety of plea&s;ing cha|racters and &s;ubjects, with which Pa&s;toral Poetry, when properly managed, is capable of being enlivened.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next, to treat of Lyric Poetry, or the Ode; a &s;pecies of Poetical Compo&s;ition which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es much dignity, and in which many Writers have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, in every age. Its peculiar character is, that it is intended to be &s;ung, or accompanied with mu&s;ic. Its de&s;ignation implies this. Ode is, in Greek, the &s;ame with Song or Hymn; and Lyric Poetry imports, that the Ver&s;es are accompanied with a lyre, or mu&s;i|cal in&s;trument. This di&s;tinction was not, at the fir&s;t, peculiar to any one &s;pecies of Poetry. For, as I ob&s;erved in the la&s;t Lecture, Mu&s;ic and Poetry were coeval, and were, originally, always joined together. But after their &s;epa|ration took place, after Bards had begun to make Ver&s;e Compo&s;itions, which were to be recited or read, not to be &s;ung, &s;uch Poems as were de&s;igned to be &s;till joined with Mu&s;ic or Song, were, by way of di&s;tinction, called Odes.</P>
<P>IN the Ode, therefore, Poetry retains its fir&s;t and mo&s;t antient form; that form, under which the original Bards poured forth their enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;trains, prai&s;ed their Gods and their Heroes, celebrated their victories, and lamented their misfortunes. It is from this circum&s;tance, of the Ode's being &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="153" REF="156">
retain its original union with Mu&s;ic, that we are to deduce the proper idea, and the pecu|liar qualities of this kind of Poetry. It is not di&s;tingui&s;hed from other kinds, by the &s;ub|jects on which it is employed; for the&s;e may be extremely various. I know no di&s;tinction of &s;ubject that belongs to it, except that other Poems are often employed in the recital of actions, whereas &s;entiments, of one kind or other, form, almo&s;t always, the &s;ubject of the Ode. But it is chiefly the &s;pirit, the manner of its execution, that marks and characteri&s;es it. Mu&s;ic and Song naturally add to the warmth of Poetry. They tend to tran&s;port, in a higher degree, both the per&s;on who &s;ings, and the per&s;ons who hear. They ju&s;tify, therefore, a bolder and more pa&s;&s;ionate &s;train, than can be &s;upported in &s;imple recitation. On this is formed the peculiar character of the Ode. Hence, the enthu&s;ia&s;m that belongs to it, and the liberties it is allowed to take, be|yond any other &s;pecies of Poetry. Hence, that neglect of regularity, tho&s;e digre&s;&s;ions, and that di&s;order which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to ad|mit; and which, indeed, mo&s;t Lyric Poets have not failed &s;ufficiently to exemplify in their practice.</P>
<P>THE effects of Mu&s;ic upon the mind are chiefly two; to rai&s;e it above its ordinary &s;tate, and fill it with high enthu&s;ia&s;tic emoti|ons; or to &s;oothe, and melt it into the gentle plea&s;urable feelings. Hence, the Ode may either a&s;pire to the former character of the
<PB N="154" REF="157">
&s;ublime and noble, or it may de&s;cend to the latter of the plea&s;ant and the gay; and be|tween the&s;e, there is, al&s;o, a middle region, of the mild and temperate emotions, which the Ode may often occupy to advantage.</P>
<P>ALL Odes may be compri&s;ed under four denominations. Fir&s;t, Sacred Odes; Hymns addre&s;&s;ed to God, or compo&s;ed on religious &s;ubjects. Of this nature are the P&s;alms of David, which exhibit to us this &s;pecies of Lyric Poetry, in its highe&s;t degree of per|fection. Secondly, Heroic Odes, which are employed in the prai&s;e of heroes, and in the celebration of martial exploits and great actions. Of this kind are all Pindar's Odes, and &s;ome few of Horace's. The&s;e two kinds ought to have &s;ublimity and elevation, for their reigning character. Thirdly, moral and philo&s;ophical Odes, where the &s;entiments are chiefly in&s;pired by virtue, friend&s;hip, and humanity. Of this kind, are many of Ho|race's Odes, and &s;everal of our be&s;t modern Lyric productions; and here the Ode po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es that middle region, which, as I ob&s;er|ved, it &s;ometimes occupies. Fourthly, Fe&s;|tive and Amorous Odes, calculated merely for plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement. Of this nature, are all Anacreon's; &s;ome of Horace's; and a great number of &s;ongs and modern produc|tions, that claim to be of the Lyric &s;pecies. The reigning character of the&s;e, ought to be elegance &s;moothne&s;s, and gaiety.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">
ONE of the chief difficulties in compo&s;ing Odes, ari&s;es from that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is under&s;tood to be a characteri&s;tic of Lyric Poetry. A profe&s;&s;ed Ode, even of the mo|ral kind, but more e&s;pecially if it attempt the &s;ublime, is expected to be enlivened and ani|mated, in an uncommon degree. Full of this idea, the Poet, when he begins to write an Ode, if he has any real warmth of genius, is apt to deliver him&s;elf up to it, without controul or re&s;traint; if he has it not, he &s;trains after it, and thinks him&s;elf bound to a&s;&s;ume the appearance, of being all fervour, and all flame. In either ca&s;e, he is in great hazard of becoming extravagant. The li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of writing without order, me|thod, or connection, has infected the Ode more than any other &s;pecies of Poetry. Hence, in the cla&s;s of Heroic Odes, we find &s;o few that one can read with plea&s;ure. The Poet is out of &s;ight, in a moment. He gets up into the clouds; becomes &s;o abrupt in his tran&s;itions; &s;o eccentric and irregular in his motions, and of cour&s;e &s;o ob&s;cure, that we e&s;&s;ay in vain to follow him, or to partake of his raptures. I do not require, that an Ode &s;hould be as regular in the &s;tructure of its parts, as a didactic, or an Epic Poem. But &s;till, in every Compo&s;ition, there ought to be a &s;ubject; there ought to be parts which make up a whole; there &s;hould be a connec|tion of tho&s;e parts with one another. The tran&s;itions from thought to thought may be light and delicate, &s;uch as are prompted by a
<PB N="156" REF="159">
lively fancy; but &s;till they &s;hould be &s;uch as pre&s;erve the connection of ideas, and &s;how the Author to be one who thinks, and not one who raves. Whatever authority may be pleaded for the incoherence and di&s;order of Lyric Poetry, nothing can be more certain, than that any compo&s;ition which is &s;o irregu|lar in its method, as to become ob&s;cure to the bulk of Readers, is &s;o much wor&s;e upon that account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"La plupart des ceux qui parlent de l'enthou&s;ia&s;me de l'ode, en parlent comme s'ils &eacute;toient eux-m&ecirc;mes dans le trouble qu'ils veulent definir.

<P>THE extravagant liberty which &s;everal of the modern Lyric Writers a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves
<PB N="157" REF="160">
in their Ver&s;ification, increa&s;es the di&s;|order of this &s;pecies of Poetry. They pro|long their periods to &s;uch a degree, they wander through &s;o many different mea&s;ures, and employ &s;uch a variety of long and &s;hort lines, corre&s;ponding in rhyme at &s;o great a di&s;tance from each other, that all &s;en&s;e of melody is utterly lo&s;t. Whereas Lyric Com|po&s;ition ought, beyond every other &s;pecies of Poetry, to pay attention to melody and beau|ty of &s;ound; and the Ver&s;ification of tho&s;e Odes may be ju&s;tly accounted the be&s;t, which renders the harmony of the mea&s;ure mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to every common ear.</P>
<P>PINDAR, the great Father of Lyric Poetry, has been the occa&s;ion of leading his imitators into &s;ome of the defects I have now menti|oned. His genius was &s;ublime; his expre&s;&s;i|ons are beautiful and happy; his de&s;criptions, picture&s;que. But finding it a very barren &s;ubject to &s;ing the prai&s;es of tho&s;e who had gained the prize in the public games, he is perpetually digre&s;&s;ive, and fills up his Poems with Fables of the Gods and Heroes, that have little connection either with his &s;ubject, or with one another. The Ancients admired him greatly; but as many of the hi&s;tories of particular families and cities, to which he al|ludes, are now unknown to us, he is &s;o ob|&s;cure, partly from his &s;ubjects, and partly from his rapid, abrupt manner of treating them, that, notwith&s;tanding the beauty of his expre&s;&s;ion, our plea&s;ure in reading him is
<PB N="158" REF="161">
much dimini&s;hed. One would imagine, that many of his modern imitators thought the be&s;t way to catch his &s;pirit, was to imitate his di&s;order and ob&s;curity. In &s;everal of the choru&s;es of Euripides and Sophocles, we have the &s;ame kind of Lyric Poetry as in Pindar, carried on with more clearne&s;s and connec|tion, and at the &s;ame time with much &s;ub|limity.</P>
<P>OF all the writers of Odes, Ancient or Modern, there is none, that, in point of cor|rectne&s;s, harmony, and happy expre&s;&s;ion, can view with Horace. He has de&s;cended from the Pindaric rapture to a more moderate de|gree of elevation; and joins connected thought, and good &s;en&s;e, with the highe&s;t beauties of Poetry. He does not often a&s;pire beyond that middle region, which I men|tioned as belonging to the Ode; and tho&s;e Odes, in which he attempts the &s;ublime, are perhaps not always his be&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There is no Ode whatever of Horace's, without great beauties. But though I may be &s;ingular in my opinion, I cannot help thinking that in &s;ome of tho&s;e Odes which have been much admired for &s;ublimity (&s;uch as Ode iv. Lib. 4. "Qualem mini&s;trum fulminis alitem, &amp;c.) there appears &s;omewhat of a &s;trained and forced effort to be lofty. The genius of this amiable Poet &s;hows it&s;elf, according to my judgment, to greater advantage, in themes of a more tem|perate kind.</NOTE>. The peculiar character, in which he excels, is grace and elegance; and in this Style of Compo&s;ition, no Poet has ever attained to a greater perfec|tion than Horace. No Poet &s;upports a mo|ral
<PB N="159" REF="162">
&s;entiment with more dignity, touches a gay one more happily, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the art of trifling more agreeably, when he chu&s;es to trifle. His language is &s;o fortunate, that with a &s;ingle word or epithet, he often con|veys a whole de&s;cription to the fancy. Hence he ever has been, and ever will continue to be, a favourite Author with all per&s;ons of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>AMONG the Latin Poets of later ages, there have been many imitators of Horace. One of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed is Ca&s;imir, a Poli&s;h Poet of the la&s;t century, who wrote four books of Odes. In graceful ea&s;e of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, he is far inferior to the Roman. He oftner affects the &s;ublime; and in the at|tempt, like other Lyric writers, frequently becomes har&s;h and unnatural. But, on &s;e|veral occa&s;ions, he di&s;covers a con&s;iderable degree of original genius, and poetical fire. Buchanan, in &s;ome of his Lyric Compo&s;iti|ons, is very elegant and cla&s;&s;ical.</P>
<P>AMONG the French, the Odes of Jean Bapti&s;te Rou&s;&s;eau, have been much, and ju&s;tly, celebrated. They po&s;&s;e&s;s great beau|ty, both of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion. They are animated, without being rhap&s;odical; and are not inferior to any poetical producti|ons in the French language.</P>
<P>IN our own Language, we have &s;everal Lyric Compo&s;itions of con&s;iderable merit.
<PB N="160" REF="163">
Dryden's Ode on St. Cecilia, is well known. Mr. Gray is di&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;ome of his Odes, both for tenderne&s;s and &s;ublimity; and in Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellanies, &s;everal very beau|tiful Lyric Poems are to be found. As to profe&s;&s;ed Pindaric Odes, they are, with a few exceptions, &s;o incoherent, as &s;eldom to be intelligible. Cowley, at all times har&s;h, is doubly &s;o in his Pindaric Compo&s;itions. In his Anacreontic Odes, he is much happier. They are &s;mooth and elegant; and, indeed, the mo&s;t agreeable, and the mo&s;t perfect, in their kind, of all Mr. Cowley's Poems.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XL. DIDACTIC POETRY&mdash;DESCRIPTIVE POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated of Pa&s;toral and Lyric Poetry, I proceed next to Didactic Poe|try; under which is included a numerous Cla&s;s of Writings. The ultimate end of all Poetry, indeed, of every compo&s;ition, &s;hould be to make &s;ome u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. This u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t com|monly made in Poetry, by indirect methods; as by fable, by narration, by repre&s;entation of characters; but Didactic Poetry openly profe&s;&s;es its intention of conveying know|ledge and in&s;truction. It differs, therefore, in the form only, not in the &s;cope and &s;ub|&s;tance, from a philo&s;ophical, a moral, or a critical treati&s;e in Pro&s;e. At the &s;ame time, by means of its form, it has &s;everal advan|tages over Pro&s;e In&s;truction. By the charm
<PB N="162" REF="165">
of Ver&s;ification and numbers, it renders in|&s;truction more agreeable; by the de&s;criptions, epi&s;odes, and other embelli&s;hments, which it may interweave, it detains, and engages the fancy; it fixes al&s;o u&s;eful circum&s;tances more deeply in the memory. Hence, it is a field, wherein a Poet may gain great honour, may di&s;play both much genius, and much know|ledge and judgment.</P>
<P>IT may be executed in different manners. The Poet may choo&s;e &s;ome in&s;tructive &s;ub|ject, and he may treat it regularly, and in+form; or, without intending a great or regu|lar work, he may only inveigh again&s;t particu|lar vices, or make &s;ome moral ob&s;ervations on human life and characters, as is commonly done in &s;atires and epi&s;tles. All the&s;e come under the denomination of Didactic Poetry.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t &s;pecies of it, is a regular treati&s;e on &s;ome philo&s;ophical, grave, or u&s;e|ful &s;ubject. Of this nature we have &s;everal, both ancient and modern, of great merit and character: &s;uch as Lucretius's &s;ix books De Rerum Natura, Virgil's Georgics, Pope's E&s;|&s;ay on Critici&s;m, Aken&s;ide's Plea&s;ures of the Imagination, Arm&s;trong on Health, Horace's, Vida's, and Boileau's Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>IN all &s;uch works, as in&s;truction is the pro|fe&s;&s;ed object, the fundamental merit con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ound thought, ju&s;t principles, clear and apt illu&s;trations. The Poet mu&s;t in&s;truct;
<PB N="163" REF="166">
but he mu&s;t &s;tudy, at the &s;ame time, to en|liven his in&s;tructions, by the introduction of &s;uch figures, and &s;uch circum&s;tances, as may amu&s;e the imagination, may conceal the dry|ne&s;s of his &s;ubject, and embelli&s;h it with poetical painting. Virgil, in his Georgics, pre&s;ents us here with a perfect model. He has the art of rai&s;ing and beautifying the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tances in rural life. When he is going to &s;ay, that the labour of the country mu&s;t be in &s;pring, he expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf thus:<Q><L>Ver&egrave; novo, gelidus canis cum montibus humor</L>

<P>IN all Didactic Works, method and order is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite; not &s;o &s;trict and for|mal as in a pro&s;e treati&s;e; yet &s;uch as may exhibit clearly to the Reader a connected train of in&s;truction. Of the Didactic Poets, whom I before mentioned, Horace in his Art of Poetry, is the one mo&s;t cen&s;ured for want of method. Indeed, if Horace be deficient in any thing throughout many of his Writings, it is in this, of not being &s;ufficiently atten|tive to juncture and connection of parts. He writes always with ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s; often in a manner &s;omewhat loo&s;e and ram|bling. There is, however, in that work much good &s;en&s;e, and excellent critici&s;m; and, if it be con&s;idered as intended for the regulation of the Roman drama, which &s;eems to have been the Author's chief purpo&s;e, it will be found to be a more complete and re|gular
<PB N="165" REF="168">
treati&s;e, than under the common notion, of its being a Sy&s;tem of the whole Poetical Art.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Epi&s;odes and Embelli&s;h|ments, great liberty is allowed to Writers of Didactic Poetry. We &s;oon tire of a conti|nued &s;eries of in&s;tructions, e&s;pecially in a poetical work, where we look for entertain|ment. The great art of rendering a Didac|tic Poem intere&s;ting, is to relieve and amu&s;e the Reader, by connecting &s;ome agreeable Epi&s;odes with the principal &s;ubject. The&s;e are always the parts of the work which are be&s;t known, and which contribute mo&s;t to &s;upport the reputation of the Poet. The principal beauties of Virgil's Georgics lie in digre&s;&s;ions of this kind, in which the Author has exerted all the force of his genius; &s;uch as the prodigies that attended the death of Julius Cae&s;ar, the Prai&s;es of Italy, the Hap|pine&s;s of a Country Life, the Fable of Ari&s;|teus, and the moving Tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. So al&s;o the favourite pa&s;&s;ages in Lucretius's work, and which alone could render &s;uch a dry and ab&s;tract &s;ubject tolera|ble in Poetry, are the digre&s;&s;ions on the Evils of Super&s;tition, the Prai&s;e of Epicurus and his philo&s;ophy, the De&s;cription of the Plague, and &s;everal other incident illu&s;tra|tions, which are remarkably elegant, and adorned with a &s;weetne&s;s and harmony of Ver&s;ification peculiar to that Poet. There is indeed nothing in Poetry, &s;o entertaining or
<PB N="166" REF="169">
de&s;criptive, but what a Didactic Writer of genius may be allowed to introduce in &s;ome part of his work; provided always, that &s;uch Epi&s;odes ari&s;e naturally from the main &s;ub|ject; that they be not di&s;proportioned in length to it; and that the Author know how to de&s;cend with propriety to the plain, as well as how to ri&s;e to the bold and figured Style.</P>
<P>MUCH art may be &s;hewn by a Didactic Poet, in connecting his Epi&s;odes happily with his &s;ubject. Virgil is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for his addre&s;s in this point. After &s;eeming to have left his hu&s;bandmen, he again returns to them very naturally by laying hold of &s;ome rural circum&s;tance, to terminate his di|gre&s;&s;ion. Thus, having &s;poken of the battle of Phar&s;alia, he &s;ubjoins immediately, with much art:<Q><L>Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis,</L>
<L>Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro,</L>

<L>And mighty relics of gigantic bones.</L>

<P><PB N="167" REF="170">
IN Engli&s;h, Dr. Aken&s;ide has attempted the mo&s;t rich and poetical form of Didactic Wri|ing in his Plea&s;ures of the Imagination; and though, in the execution of the whole, he is not equal, he has, in &s;everal parts, &s;ucceed|ed happily, and di&s;played much genius. Dr. Arm&s;trong, in his Art of Pre&s;erving Health, has not aimed at &s;o high a &s;train as the other. But he is more equal; and maintains throughout a cha&s;te, and correct elegance.</P>
<P>SATIRES and Epi&s;tles naturally run into a more familiar Style, than &s;olemn Philo&s;o|phical Poetry. As the manners and charac|ters, which occur in ordinary life, are their &s;ubject, they require being treated with &s;ome|what of the ea&s;e and freedom of conver&s;a|tion, and hence it is commonly the <Q REND="inline">"mu&s;a pede&s;tris,"</Q> which reigns in &s;uch Compo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>SATIRE, in its fir&s;t &s;tate among the Romans, had a form different from what it afterwards a&s;&s;umed. Its origin is ob&s;cure, and has given occa&s;ion to altercation among Critics. It &s;eems to have been at fir&s;t a relic of the Ancient Co|medy, written partly in Pro&s;e, partly in Ver&s;e, and abounding with &s;currility. Ennius and Lucilius corrected its gro&s;&s;ne&s;s; and at la&s;t, Horace brought it into that form, which now gives the denomination to Satirical Writing. Reformation of manners, is the end which it profe&s;&s;es to have in view; and in order to this end, it a&s;&s;umes the liberty of boldly cen&s;uring vice, and vicious characters.
<PB N="168" REF="171">
It has been carried on in three different man|ners, by the three great Ancient Satiri&s;ts, Horace, Juvenal, and Per&s;ius. Horace's Style has not much elevation. He entitled his Satires, "Sermones," and &s;eems not to have intended ri&s;ing much higher than Pro&s;e put into numbers. His manner is ea&s;y and grace|ful. They are rather the follies and weak|ne&s;&s;es of mankind, than their enormous vices, which he chu&s;es for the object of his Satire. He reproves with a &s;miling a&s;pect; and while he moralizes like a &s;ound Philo&s;opher, di&s;|covers, at the &s;ame time, the politene&s;s of a courtier. Juvenal is much more &s;erious and declamatory. He has more &s;trength and fire, and more elevation of Style, than Horace; but is greatly inferior to him in gracefulne&s;s and ea&s;e. His Satire is more zealous, more &s;harp and pointed, as being generally directed again&s;t more flagitious characters. As Scali|ger &s;ays of him, <Q REND="inline">"ardet, in&s;tat, jugulat;"</Q> whereas Horace's character is, <Q REND="inline">"admi&s;&s;us circum praecordia ludit."</Q> Per&s;ius has a greater re&s;emblance of the force and fire of Juvenal, than of the politene&s;s of Horace. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;entiments of noble and &s;ublime morality. He is a nervous and lively writer; but withal, often har&s;h and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>POETICAL Epi&s;tles, when employed on moral or critical &s;ubjects, &s;eldom ri&s;e into a higher &s;train of Poetry than Satires. In the form of an Epi&s;tle, indeed, many other &s;ub|jects
<PB N="169" REF="172">
may be handled, and either Love Poetry, or Elegiac, may be carried on; as in Ovid's Epi&s;tolae Heroidum, and his Epi&s;tolae de I onto. Such works as the&s;e are de&s;igned to be merely &s;entimental; and as their merit con&s;i&s;ts in being proper expre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;i|on or &s;entiment which forms the &s;ubject, they may a&s;&s;ume any tone of Poetry that is &s;uited to it. But Didactic Epi&s;tles, of which I now &s;peak, &s;eldom admit of much elevation. They are commonly intended as ob&s;ervations on Authors, or on Life and Characters; in delivering which, the Poet does not purpo&s;e to compo&s;e a formal treati&s;e, or to confine him&s;elf &s;trictly to regular method; but gives &s;cope to his genius on &s;ome particular theme, which, at the time, has prompted him to write. In all Didactic Poetry of this kind, it is an important rule <Q REND="inline">"quicquid precipies, e&s;to brevis."</Q> Much of the grace, both of Sati|rical and Epi&s;tolary Writing, con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;pirited conci&s;ene&s;s. This gives to &s;uch com|po&s;ition an edge and a liveline&s;s, which &s;trike the fancy, and keep attention awake. Much of their merit depends al&s;o on ju&s;t and happy repre&s;entations of characters. As they are not &s;upported by tho&s;e high beauties of de|&s;criptive and poetical language which adorn other compo&s;itions, we expect, in return, to be entertained with lively paintings of men and manners, which are always plea&s;ing; and in the&s;e, a certain &s;prightline&s;s and turn of wit finds its proper place. The higher &s;pecies
<PB N="170" REF="173">
of Poetry &s;eldom admit it; but here it is &s;ea|&s;onable and beautiful.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e re&s;pects, Mr. Pope's Ethical Epi&s;tles de&s;erve to be mentioned with &s;ignal honour, as a model, next to perfect, of this kind of Poetry. Here, perhaps, the &s;trength of his genius appeared. In the more &s;ublime parts of Poetry, he is not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed. In the enthu&s;ia&s;m, the fire, the force and co|piou&s;ne&s;s of poetic genius, Dryden, though a much le&s;s correct Writer, appears to have been &s;uperior to him. One can &s;carce think that he was capable of Epic or Tragic Poetry; but within a certain limited region, he has been outdone by no Poet. His tran&s;lation of the Iliad will remain a la&s;ting monument to his honour, as the mo&s;t elegant and highly fini&s;hed tran&s;lation, that, perhaps, ever was given of any poetical work. That he was not incapable of tender Poetry, appears from the epi&s;tle of Eloi&s;a to Abelard, and from the ver&s;es to the memory of an unfortunate Lady, which are almo&s;t his only &s;entimental pro|ductions; and which indeed are excellent in their kind. But the qualities for which he is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed are, judgment and wit, with a conci&s;e and happy expre&s;&s;ion, and a melodious ver&s;ification. Few Poets ever had more wit, and at the &s;ame time more judg|ment, to direct the proper employment of that wit.

and in his &s;erious works, &s;uch as his E&s;&s;ay on Man, and his Ethic Epi&s;tles, his wit ju&s;t di&s;|covers it&s;elf as much, as to give a proper &s;ea&s;oning to grave reflexions. His imitations of Horace are &s;o peculiarly happy, that one is at a lo&s;s, whether mo&s;t to admire the origi|nal or the copy; and they are among the few imitations extant, that have all the grace and ea&s;e of an original. His paintings of charac|ters are natural and lively in a high degree; and never was any Writer &s;o happy in that conci&s;e &s;pirited Style, which gives animation to Satyres and Epi&s;tles. We are never &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the good effects of rhyme in Eng|li&s;h ver&s;e, as in reading the&s;e parts of his works. We &s;ee it adding to the Style, and elevation which otherwi&s;e it could not have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; while at the &s;ame time he manages it &s;o artfully, that it never appears in the lea&s;t to encumber him; but, on the contrary, &s;erves to increa&s;e the liveline&s;s of his manner. He tells us him&s;elf, that he could expre&s;s moral ob&s;ervations more conci&s;ely, and there|fore more forcibly, in rhyme, than he could do in pro&s;e.</P>
<P>AMONG moral and Didactic Poets, Dr. Young is of too great eminence, to be pa&s;&s;ed over without notice. In all his works, the marks of &s;trong genius appear. His Univer|&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the full merit of that animated conci&s;ene&s;s of Style, and lively de|&s;cription of characters, which I mentioned as particularly requi&s;ite in Satirical and Didactic
<PB N="172" REF="175">
Compo&s;itions. Though his wit may often be thought too &s;parkling, and his &s;entences too pointed, yet the vivacity of his fancy is &s;o great, as to entertain every Reader. In his Night Thoughts, there is much energy of ex|pre&s;&s;ion; in the three fir&s;t, there are &s;everal pathetic pa&s;&s;ages; and &s;cattered through them all, happy images and illu&s;ions, as well as pious reflections, occur. But the &s;entiments are frequently over-&s;trained, and turgid; and the Style is too har&s;h and ob&s;cure to be plea&s;|ing. Among French Authors, Boileau has undoubtedly much merit in Didactic Poetry. Their later Critics are unwilling to allow him any great &s;hare of original genius, or poetic fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vid. Po&euml;tique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e de Marmontel.</NOTE>. But his Art of Poetry, his Satires and Epi&s;tles, mu&s;t ever be e&s;teemed eminent, not only for &s;olid and judicious thought, but for correct and elegant poetical expre&s;&s;ion, and fortunate imitation of the Ancients.</P>
<P>FROM Didactic, I proceed next to treat of De&s;criptive Poetry, where the highe&s;t exerti|ons of genius may be di&s;played. By De|&s;criptive Poetry, I do not mean any one par|ticular &s;pecies or form of Compo&s;ition. There are few Compo&s;itions of any length, that can be called purely de&s;criptive, or wherein the Poet propo&s;es to him&s;elf no other object, but merely to de&s;cribe, without employing narration, action, or moral &s;enti|ment,
<PB N="173" REF="176">
as the ground-work of his Piece. De|&s;cription is generally introduced as an embel|li&s;hment, rather than made the &s;ubject, of a regular work. But though it &s;eldom form a &s;eparate &s;pecies of writing, yet into every &s;pecies of Poetical Compo&s;ition, Pa&s;toral, Lyric, Didactic, Epic, and Dramatic, it both enters, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in each of them a very con&s;iderable place; &s;o that in treating of Poetry, it demands no &s;mall attention.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTION is the great te&s;t of a Poet's imagination; and always di&s;tingui&s;hes an original from a &s;econd-rate Genius. To a Writer of the inferior cla&s;s, nature, when at any time he attempts to de&s;cribe it, appears exhau&s;ted by tho&s;e who have gone before him in the &s;ame tract. He &s;ees nothing new, or peculiar, in the object which he would paint; his conceptions of it are loo&s;e and vague; and his expre&s;&s;ions, of cour&s;e, feeble and general. He gives us words rather than ideas; we meet with the language indeed of poetical de&s;crip|tion, but we apprehend the object de&s;cribed very indi&s;tinctly. Whereas, a true Poet makes us imagine that we &s;ee it before our eyes; he catches the di&s;tingui&s;hing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality; he places it in &s;uch a light, that a Painter could copy after him. This happy talent is chiefly owing to a &s;trong imagination, which fir&s;t receives a lively impre&s;&s;ion of the object; and then, by employing a proper &s;election of circum&s;tances
<PB N="174" REF="177">
in de&s;cribing it, tran&s;mits that impre&s;&s;ion in its full force to the imagination of others.</P>
<P>IN this &s;election of circum&s;tances, lies the great art of Picture&s;que De&s;cription. In the fir&s;t place, they ought not to be vulgar, and common ones, &s;uch as are apt to pa&s;s by without remark; but, as much as po&s;&s;ible, new and original, which may catch the fancy, and draw attention. In the next place, they ought to be &s;uch as particularize the object de&s;cribed, and mark it &s;trongly. No de&s;crip|tion, that re&s;ts in Generals, can be good. For we can conceive nothing clearly in the ab|&s;tract; all di&s;tinct ideas are formed upon particulars. In the third place, all the cir|cum&s;tances employed ought to be uniform, and of a piece; that is, when de&s;cribing a great object, every circum&s;tance brought into view &s;hould tend to aggrandize; or, when de|&s;cribing a gay and plea&s;ant one, &s;hould tend to beautify, that by this means, the impre&s;&s;i|on may re&s;t upon the imagination complete and entire: and la&s;tly, the circum&s;tances in de&s;cription &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed with conci&s;e|ne&s;s, and with &s;implicity; for, when either too much exaggerated, or too long dwelt upon and extended, they never fail to enfeeble the impre&s;&s;ion that is de&s;igned to be made. Bre|vity, almo&s;t always, contributes to vivacity. The&s;e general rules will be be&s;t under&s;tood by illu&s;trations, founded on particular in|&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">
OF all profe&s;&s;ed De&s;criptive Compo&s;itions, the large&s;t and fulle&s;t that I am acquainted with, in any language, is Mr. Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons; a work which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es very un|common merit. The Style, in the mid&s;t of much &s;plendour and &s;trength, is &s;ometimes har&s;h, and may be cen&s;ured as deficient in ea&s;e and di&s;tinctne&s;s. But, notwith&s;tanding this defect, Thom&s;on is a &s;trong and a beau|tiful De&s;criber; for he had a feeling heart, and a warm imagination. He had &s;tudied, and copied nature with care. Enamoured of her beauties, he not only de&s;cribed them pro|perly, but felt their impre&s;&s;ion with &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility. The impre&s;&s;ion which he felt, he tran&s;mits to his Readers; and no per&s;on of ta&s;te can peru&s;e any one of his Sea&s;ons, without having the ideas and feelings which belonged to that &s;ea&s;on, recalled, and rendered pre&s;ent to his mind. Several in&s;tances of mo&s;t beautiful de&s;cription might be given from him; &s;uch as, the &s;hower in Spring, the morning in Summer, and the man pe|ri&s;hing in &s;now in Winter. But, at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall produce a pa&s;&s;age of another kind, to &s;hew the power of a &s;ingle well cho&s;en cir|cum&s;tance, to heighten a de&s;cription. In his Summer, relating to the effects of heat in the torrid zone, he is led to take notice of the pe&s;tilence that de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h fleet, at Carthagena, under Admiral Vernon; when he has the following lines:<Q><PB N="176" REF="179">
<L>&mdash;you, gallant Vernon, &s;aw</L>
<L>The mi&s;erable &s;cene; you pitying &s;aw</L>

<L>Saw the deep racking pang; the gha&s;tly form;</L>

<P>ALL the circum&s;tances here are properly cho&s;en, for &s;etting this di&s;mal &s;cene in a &s;trong light before our eyes. But what is mo&s;t &s;triking in the picture, is, the la&s;t image. We are conducted through all the &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, till we come to the morta|lity prevailing in the fleet, which a vulgar Poet would have de&s;cribed by exaggerated expre&s;&s;ions, concerning the multiplied tro|phies and victories of death. But, how much more is the imagination impre&s;&s;ed, by this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, of dead bodies thrown overboard every night; of the con&s;tant &s;ound of their falling into the waters; and of the Admiral li&s;tening to this melancholy &s;ound, &s;o often &s;triking his ear?<Q><L>Heard nightly plunged, amid the &s;ullen waves,</L>
<L>The frequent cor&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The elogium which Dr. John&s;on, in his Lives of the Poets, gives of Thom&s;on, is high, and, in my opinion, very ju&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"As a Writer, he is entitled to one prai&s;e of the highe&s;t kind; his mode of thinking, and of expre&s;&s;ing his thoughts, is original. His Blank Ver&s;e is no more the Blank Ver&s;e of Milton, or of any other Poet, than the Rhymes of Prior are the Rhymes of Cowley. His numbers, his pau&s;es, his diction, are of his own growth, without tran&s;cription, without imitation. He thinks in a peculiar train, and he thinks always as a man of genius. He looks round on nature and life, with the eye which nature be&s;tows only on a Poet; the eye that di&s;tingui&s;hes in every thing pre&s;ented to its view, whatever there is on which imagination can delight to be detained; and with a mind, that at once comprehends the va&s;t, and attends to the minute. The Reader of the Sea&s;ons wonders that he never &s;aw before what Thom&s;on &s;hews him, and that he never yet has felt what Thom&s;on impre&s;&s;es.&mdash;His de|&s;criptions of extended &s;cenes, and general effects, bring before us the whole magnificence of nature, whether plea&s;ing or dreadful. The gaiety of Spring, the &s;plen|dour of Summer, the tranquillity of Autumn, and the horror of Winter, take, in their turn, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind.

MR. PARNELL'S Tale of the Hermit, is con&s;picuous, throughout the whole of it, for beautiful De&s;criptive Narration. The man|ner of the Hermit's &s;etting forth to vi&s;it the world; his meeting with a companion, and the hou&s;es in which they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively en|tertained, of the vain man, the covetous man, and the good man, are pieces of very fine painting, touched with a light and deli|cate pencil, overcharged with no &s;uperfluous colouring, and conveying to us a lively idea of the objects. But, of all the Engli&s;h Poems in the De&s;criptive Style, the riche&s;t
<PB N="178" REF="181">
and mo&s;t remarkable are, Milton's Allegro and Pen&s;ero&s;o. The collection of gay images on the one hand, and of melancholy ones on the other, exhibited in the&s;e two &s;mall, but inimitably fine Poems, are as exqui&s;ite as can be conceived. They are, indeed, the &s;tore|hou&s;e whence many &s;ucceeding Poets have enriched their de&s;criptions of &s;imilar &s;ubjects; and they alone are &s;ufficient for illu&s;trating the ob&s;ervations which I made, concerning the proper &s;election of circum&s;tances in De|&s;criptive Writing. Take, for in&s;tance, the following pa&s;&s;age from the Pen&s;ero&s;o:<Q><L>&mdash;I walk un&s;een</L>
<L>On the dry, &s;mooth-&s;haven green,</L>
<L>To behold the wandering moon,</L>
<L>Riding near her highe&s;t noon;</L>
<L>And oft, as if her head &s;he bow'd,</L>
<L>Stooping through a fleecy cloud.</L>
<L>Oft, on a plat of ri&s;ing ground,</L>
<L>I hear the far off curfew &s;ound,</L>
<L>Over &s;ome wide watered &s;hore,</L>
<L>Swinging &s;low with &s;olemn roar:</L>
<L>Or, if the air will not permit,</L>
<L>Some &s;till removed place will fit,</L>
<L>Where glowing embers through the room</L>
<L>Teach light to counterfeit a gloom;</L>
<L>Far from all re&s;ort of mirth,</L>
<L>Save the cricket on the hearth,</L>
<L>Or the belman's drow&s;y charm,</L>
<L>To ble&s;s the doors from nightly harm;</L>
<L>Or let my lamp, at midnight hour,</L>

<P>HERE, there are no unmeaning general expre&s;&s;ions; all is particular; all is Pictu|re&s;que; nothing forced or exaggerated; but a &s;imple Style, and a collection of &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ive images, which are all of one cla&s;s, and recall a number of &s;imilar ideas of the melancholy kind: particularly, the walk by moon-light; the &s;ound of the curfew bell heard di&s;tant; the dying embers in the cham|ber; the Bellman's call; and the lamp &s;een at midnight, in the high lonely tower. We may ob&s;erve, too, the conci&s;ene&s;s of the Poet's manner. He does not re&s;t long on one circum&s;tance, or employ a great many words to de&s;cribe it; which always makes the im|pre&s;&s;ion faint and languid; but placing it in one &s;trong point of view, full and clear be|fore the Reader, he there leaves it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"FROM his &s;hield and his helmet,"</Q> &s;ays Homer, de&s;cribing one of his heroes in bat|tle, <Q REND="inline">"From his &s;hield and helmet, there &s;parkled an ince&s;&s;ant blaze; like the au|tumnal &s;tar, when it appears in its bright|ne&s;s from the waters of the ocean."</Q> This is &s;hort and lively; but when it comes into Mr. Pope's hand, it evaporates in three pom|pous
<PB N="180" REF="183">
lines, each of which repeats the &s;ame image in different words:<Q><L>High on his helm cele&s;tial lightnings play,</L>
<L>His beamy &s;hield emits a living ray;</L>
<L>Th' unwearied blaze ince&s;&s;ant &s;treams &s;upplies,</L>
<L>Like the red &s;tar that fires th' autumnal &s;kies.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, in general, that, in de&s;cribing &s;olemn or great objects, the con|ci&s;e manner is, almo&s;t always, proper. De|&s;criptions of gay and &s;miling &s;cenes can bear to be more amplified and prolonged; as &s;trength is not the predominant quality ex|pected in the&s;e. But where a &s;ublime, or a pathetic impre&s;&s;ion is intended to be made, energy is above all things required. The ima|gination ought then to be &s;eized at once; and it is far more deeply impre&s;&s;ed by one &s;trong and ardent image, than by the anxious minutene&s;s of laboured illu&s;tration.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"His face was without form, and dark,"</Q> &s;ays O&s;&s;ian, de&s;cribing a gho&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;tars dim twinkled through his form; thrice he &s;ighed over the hero; and thrice the winds of the night roared around."</Q></P>
<P>IT de&s;erves attention too, that in de&s;cribing inanimate natural objects, the Poet, in order to enliven his de&s;cription, ought always to mix living beings with them. The &s;cenes of dead and &s;till life are apt to pall upon us, if the Poet do not &s;ugge&s;t &s;entiments, and in|troduce
<PB N="181" REF="184">
life and action into his de&s;cription. This is well known to every Painter who is a ma&s;ter in his art. Seldom has any beauti|ful land&s;cape been drawn, without &s;ome human being repre&s;ented on the canvas, as beholding it, or on &s;ome account concerned in it:

<P>THE touching part of the&s;e fine lines of Virgil's, is the la&s;t, which &s;ets before us the intere&s;t of two lovers in this rural &s;cene.

<P>EVERY thing, as I before &s;aid, in de&s;crip|tion, &s;hould be as marked and particular as po&s;&s;ible, in order to imprint on the mind a di&s;tinct and complete image. A hill, a river, or a lake, ri&s;e up more con&s;picuous to the

fancy, when &s;ome particular lake, or river, or hill, is &s;pecified, than when the terms are left general. Mo&s;t of the Ancient Writers have been &s;en&s;ible of the advantage which this gives to de&s;cription. Thus, in that beau|tiful Pa&s;toral Compo&s;ition, the Song of Solo|mon, the images are commonly particulari&s;ed by the objects to which they allude. <Q>"It is the Ro&s;e of Sharon; the lily of the vallies; the flock which feeds on Mount Gilead; the &s;tream which comes from Mount Le|banon.

<P>BOTH Homer and Virgil are remarkable for the talent of Poetical De&s;cription. In Virgil's &s;econd Aeneid, where he de&s;cribes
<PB N="183" REF="186">
the burning and &s;acking of Troy, the par|ticulars are &s;o well &s;elected and repre&s;ented, that the Reader finds him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of that &s;cene of horror. The death of Priam, e&s;pecially, may be &s;ingled out as a ma&s;ter|piece of de&s;cription. All the circum&s;tances of the aged monarch arraying him&s;elf in Ar|mour, when he finds the enemy making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city; his meeting with his family, who are taking &s;helter at an altar in the court of the palace, and their placing him in the mid&s;t of them; his indig|nation when he beholds Pyrrhus &s;laughtering one of his &s;ons; the feeble dart which he throws; with Pyrrhus's brutal behaviour, and his manner of putting the old man to death, are painted in the mo&s;t affecting man|ner, and with a ma&s;terly hand. All Homer's battles, and Milton's account, both of Para|di&s;e, and of the Infernal Regions, furni&s;h many beautiful in&s;tances of Poetical De&s;crip|tion. O&s;&s;ian too, paints in &s;trong and lively colours, though he employs few circum&s;tan|ces; and his chief excellency lies in painting to the heart. One of his fulle&s;t De&s;criptions is the following of the ruins of Balclutha:
<PB N="184" REF="187">
<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een the walls of Balclutha, but they were de&s;olate. The fire had re&s;ound|ed within the halls; and the voice of the people is now heard no more. The &s;tream of Clutha was removed from its place, by the fall of the walls; the thi&s;tle &s;hook there its lonely head; the mo&s;s whi&s;tled to the wind. The fox looked out of the window; the rank gra&s;s waved round his head. De&s;olate is the dwelling of Moina. Silence is in the hou&s;e of her fathers."</Q> Shake&s;peare cannot be omitted on this occa&s;i|on, as &s;ingularly eminent for painting with the pencil of nature. Though it be in man|ners and characters, that his chief excellency lies, yet his &s;cenery al&s;o is often exqui&s;ite, and happily de&s;cribed by a &s;ingle &s;troke; as in that fine line of the "Merchant of Venice," which conveys to the fancy as natural and beautiful an image, as can po&s;&s;ibly be exhi|bited in &s;o few words:
<Q><L>How &s;weet the moon-light &s;leeps upon this bank!</L>
<L>Here will we &s;it, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>MUCH of the beauty of De&s;criptive Poetry depends on a right choice of Epithets. Many Poets, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are too carele&s;s in this particular. Epithets are frequently brought in, merely to complete the ver&s;e, or make the rhyme an&s;wer; and hence they are &s;o unmeaning and redundant; expletive words only, which, in place of adding anything
<PB N="185" REF="188">
to the de&s;cription, clog and enervate it. Virgil's "Liquidi fontes," and Horace's "Prata canis albicant pruinis," mu&s;t, I am afraid, be a&s;&s;igned to this cla&s;s: for, to de|note by an epithet that water is liquid, or that &s;now is white, is no better than mere tautology. Every Epithet &s;hould either add a new idea to the word which it qualifies, or at lea&s;t &s;erve to rai&s;e and heighten its known &s;ignification. So in Milton,<Q><L>&mdash;Who &s;hall tempt with wand'ring feet</L>
<L>The dark, unbottom'd, infinite aby&s;s,</L>
<L>And through the palpable ob&s;cure, find out</L>
<L>His uncouth way? or &s;pread his airy flight,</L>
<L>Upborn with indefatigable wings,</L>
<L>Over the va&s;t abrupt?</L>
<BIBL>B.

But there are a &s;ort of general epi|thets, which, though they appear to rai&s;e the &s;ignification of the word to which they are joined, yet leave it &s;o undetermined, and are now become &s;o trite and beaten in poetical language, as to be perfectly in&s;ipid. Of this kind are <Q REND="inline">"barbarous di&s;cord&mdash;hateful envy&mdash;mighty chiefs&mdash;bloody war&mdash;gloomy &s;hades

<PB N="186" REF="189">
&mdash;direful &s;cenes,"</Q> and a thou&s;and more of the &s;ame kind which we meet with occa&s;ionally in good Poets; but with which, Poets of in|ferior genius abound every where, as the great props of their affected &s;ublimity. They give a &s;ort of &s;well to the language, and rai&s;e it above the tone of Pro&s;e; but they &s;erve not in the lea&s;t to illu&s;trate the object de&s;crib|ed; on the contrary, they load the Style with a languid verbo&s;ity.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES it is in the power of a Poet of genius, by one well-cho&s;en epithet, to accom|pli&s;h a de&s;cription, and by means of a &s;ingle word, to paint a whole &s;cene to the fancy. We may remark this effect of an epithet in the following fine lines of Milton's Lycidas:<Q><L>Where were ye, nymphs, when the remor&s;ele&s;s deep</L>
<L>Clos'd o'er the head of your lov'd Lycidas?</L>
<L>For neither were ye playing on the &s;teep,</L>

<L>Nor on the &s;haggy top of Mona high,</L>

<P>AMONG the&s;e wild &s;cenes, <Q REND="inline">"Deva's wizard &s;tream"</Q> is admirably imagined; by this one word, pre&s;enting to the fancy all the romantic ideas, of a river flowing through a de&s;olate country, with banks haunted by wizards and enchanters. Akin to this is an epithet which Horace gives to the river Hyda&s;pes. A good man, &s;ays he, &s;tands in need of no arms,<Q><PB N="187" REF="190">

<P>VIRGIL has employed an epithet with great beauty and propriety, when account|ing for Daedalus not having engraved the fortune of his &s;on Icarus:

THESE in&s;tances, and ob&s;ervations, may give &s;ome ju&s;t idea of true poetical de&s;crip|tion.

<HEAD>LECTURE XLI. THE POETRY OF THE HEBREWS.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various kinds of Poetry, which we are, at pre&s;ent, employed in examining, the Antient Hebrew Poetry, or that of the Scriptures, ju&s;tly de&s;erves a place. Viewing tho&s;e &s;acred books in no higher light, than as they pre&s;ent to us the mo&s;t antient monuments of Poetry extant, at this day, in the world, they afford a curious object of Critici&s;m. They di&s;play the ta&s;te of a remote age and country. They exhibit a &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition, very different from any other with which we are acquainted, and, at the &s;ame time, beautiful. Con&s;idered as In&s;pired Writings, they give ri&s;e to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of ano|ther kind. But it is our bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to con&s;ider them not in a theological, but in a critical view: and it mu&s;t needs give plea|&s;ure, if we &s;hall find the beauty and dignity of the Compo&s;ition, adequate to the weight
<PB N="190" REF="193">
and importance of the matter. Dr. Lowth's learned Treati&s;e, "De Sacra Po&euml;&s;i Hebraeo|rum," ought to be peru&s;ed by all who de|&s;ire to become thoroughly acquainted with this &s;ubject. It is a work exceedingly valua|ble, both for the elegance of its Compo&s;ition and for the ju&s;tne&s;s of the critici&s;m which it contains. In this Lecture, as I cannot illu&s;|trate the &s;ubject with more benefit to the Reader, than by following the track of that ingenious Author, I &s;hall make much u&s;e of his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I NEED not &s;pend many words in &s;how|ing, that among the books of the Old Te&s;ta|ment there is &s;uch an apparent diver&s;ity in Style, as &s;ufficiently di&s;covers, which of them are to be con&s;idered as poetical, and which, as pro&s;e compo&s;itions. While the hi&s;torical books, and legi&s;lative writings of Mo&s;es, are evidently pro&s;aic in the compo&s;ition, the Book of Job, the P&s;alms of David, the Song of Solomon, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, a great part of the Prophetical Writings, and &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages &s;cattered occa&s;ionally through the hi&s;torical books, carry the mo&s;t plain and di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of Poetical Writing.</P>
<P>THERE is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on for doubt|ing, that originally the&s;e were written in ver&s;e, or &s;ome kind of mea&s;ured numbers; though as the antient pronunciation of the Hebrew Language is now lo&s;t, we are not able to a&s;certain the nature of the Hebrew
<PB N="191" REF="194">
ver&s;e, or at mo&s;t can a&s;certain it but imper|fectly. Concerning this point there have been great controver&s;ies among learned men, which it is immaterial to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s. Taking the Old Te&s;tament in our own tran&s;lation, which is extremely lite|ral, we find plain marks of many parts of the original being written in a mea&s;ured Style; and the <Q REND="inline">"disjecti membra po&euml;tae,"</Q> often &s;how them&s;elves. Let any per&s;on read the Hi&s;to|rical Introduction to the book of Job, con|tained in the fir&s;t and &s;econd chapters, and then go on to Job's &s;peech in the beginning of the third chapter, and he cannot avoid being &s;en&s;ible, that he pa&s;&s;es all at once from the region of Pro&s;e, to that of Poetry. Not only the poetical &s;entiments, and the figured Style, warn him of the change; but the ca|dence of the &s;entence, and the arrangement of the words are &s;en&s;ibly altered; the change is as great as when he pa&s;&s;es from reading Cae&s;ar's Commentaries, to read Virgil's Aeneid. This is &s;ufficient to &s;how that the &s;acred Scriptures contain, what mu&s;t be called Poe|try in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of that word; and I &s;hall afterwards &s;how, that they contain in|&s;tances of mo&s;t of the different forms of Poetical Writing. It may be proper to re|mark, in pa&s;&s;ing, that hence ari&s;es a mo&s;t invincible argument in honour of Poetry. No per&s;on can imagine that to be a frivolous and contemptible art, which has been em|ployed by Writers under divine in&s;piration; and has been cho&s;en as a proper channel,
<PB N="192" REF="195">
for conveying to the world the knowledge of divine truth.</P>
<P>FROM the earlie&s;t times, Mu&s;ic and Poe|try were cultivated among the Hebrews. In the days of the Judges, mention is made of the Schools or Colleges of the Prophets; where one part of the employment of the per&s;ons trained in &s;uch &s;chools was, to &s;ing the prai&s;es of God, accompanied with various in&s;truments. In the fir&s;t Book of Samuel, (chap. x. 7.) we find on a public occa&s;ion, a company of tho&s;e Prophets coming down from the hill where the &s;chool was, <Q REND="inline">"pro|phe&s;ying,"</Q> it is &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"with the p&s;altery, tabret, and harp before them."</Q> But in the days of King David, Mu&s;ic and Poetry were carried to their greate&s;t height. For the &s;ervice of the Tabernacle, he appointed four thou&s;and Levites, divided into twenty-four cour&s;es, and mar&s;halled under &s;everal leaders, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;ing Hymns, and to perform the in&s;trumental mu&s;ic in the public wor&s;hip. A&s;aph, Heman, and Jedu|thun, were the chief directors of the mu&s;ic; and, from the titles of &s;ome P&s;alms, it would appear that they were al&s;o eminent compo|&s;ers of Hymns or &s;acred Poems. In chapter xxv. of the fir&s;t Book of Chronicles, an ac|count is given of David's in&s;titutions, relating to the &s;acred Mu&s;ic and Poetry; which were certainly more co&s;tly, more &s;plendid and mag|nificent, than ever obtained in the public &s;er|vice of any other nation.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="196">
THE general con&s;truction of the Hebrew Poetry is of a &s;ingular nature, and peculiar to it&s;elf. It con&s;i&s;ts in dividing every period into corre&s;pondent, for the mo&s;t part into equal members, which an&s;wer to one ano|ther, both in &s;en&s;e and &s;ound. In the fir&s;t member of the period a &s;entiment is expre&s;|&s;ed; and in the &s;econd member, the &s;ame &s;entiment is amplified, or is repeated in dif|ferent terms, or &s;ometimes contra&s;ted with its oppo&s;ite; but in &s;uch a manner that the &s;ame &s;tructure, and nearly the &s;ame number of words is pre&s;erved. This, is the general &s;train of all the Hebrew Poetry. In&s;tances of it occur every where on opening the Old Te&s;tament. Thus, in P&s;alm xcvi. <Q REND="inline">"Sing unto the Lord a new &s;ong&mdash;Sing unto the Lord all the earth. Sing unto the Lord and ble&s;s his name&mdash;&s;hew forth his &s;alvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the heathen&mdash;his wonders among all the people. For the Lord is great and greatly to be prai&s;ed&mdash;He is to be feared above all the gods. Honour and maje&s;ty are before him&mdash;Strength and beauty are in his &s;anctuary."</Q> It is owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to this form of Compo|&s;ition, that our ver&s;ion, though in Pro&s;e, re|tains &s;o much of a Poetical ca&s;t. For the ver|&s;ion being &s;trictly word for word after the ori|ginal, the form and order of the original &s;en|tence is pre&s;erved; which, by this artificial &s;tructure, this regular alternation and corre&s;|pondence of parts, makes the ear &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="194" REF="197">
a departure from the common Style and tone of Pro&s;e.</P>
<P>THE origin of this form of Poetical Com|po&s;ition among the Hebrews, is clearly to be deduced from the manner in which their Sa|cred Hymns were wont to be &s;ung. They were accompanied with mu&s;ic, and they were performed by choirs or bands of &s;ingers and mu&s;icians, who an&s;wered alternately to each other. When, for in&s;tance, one band began the Hymn thus: <Q REND="inline">"The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice";</Q> the chorus, or &s;emi|chorus, took up the corre&s;ponding ver&s;icle: <Q REND="inline">"Let the multitudes of the i&s;les be glad thereof."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him,"</Q> &s;ung the one; the other replied, <Q REND="inline">"Judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s are the habitation of his throne."</Q> And in this manner their Poetry, when &s;et to mu&s;ic, naturally divided it&s;elf into a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;trophes and anti&s;trophes corre&s;pondent to each other; whence, it is probable, the ori|gin of the Antiphon, or Re&s;pon&s;ory, in the public religious &s;ervice of &s;o many Chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>WE are expre&s;sly told, in the Book of Ezra, that the Levites &s;ung in this manner; <Q REND="inline">"Alternatim,"</Q> or by cour&s;e (Ezra iii. 11.) and &s;ome of David's P&s;alms bear plain marks of their being compo&s;ed in order to be thus performed. The 24th P&s;alm, in particular, which is thought to have been compo&s;ed on
<PB N="195" REF="198">
the great and &s;olemn occa&s;ion of the Ark of the Covenant being brought back to Mount Zion, mu&s;t have had a noble effect when performed after this manner, as Dr. Lowth has illu&s;trated it. The whole people are &s;uppo&s;ed to be attending the proce&s;&s;ion. The Levites and Singers, divided into their &s;everal cour&s;es, and accompanied with all their mu&s;ical in&s;truments, lead the way. After the Introduction to the P&s;alm, in the two fir&s;t ver&s;es, when the proce&s;&s;ion begins to a&s;cend the &s;acred Mount, the que&s;tion is put, as by a &s;emichorus, <Q REND="inline">"Who &s;hall a&s;cend unto the hill of the Lord, and who &s;hall &s;tand in his holy place?"</Q> The re&s;pon&s;e is made by the full chorus with the greate&s;t dignity; <Q REND="inline">"He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his &s;oul to vanity, nor &s;worn deceitfully."</Q> As the proce&s;&s;ion approaches to the doors of the Tabernacle, the chorus, with all their in&s;tru|ments, join in this exclamation: <Q REND="inline">"Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everla&s;ting doors, and the King of Glory &s;hall come in."</Q> Here the &s;emichorus plainly break in, as with a lower voice, <Q REND="inline">"Who is this King of Glory?"</Q> and at the moment when the Ark is introduced into the Tabernacle, the re&s;pon&s;e is made by the bur&s;t of the whole chorus: <Q REND="inline">"The Lord, &s;trong and mighty; the Lord, mighty in battle."</Q> I take notice of this in&s;tance the rather, as it &s;erves to &s;how how much of the grace and magnificence of the &s;acred Poems, as indeed
<PB N="196" REF="199">
of all Poems, depend upon our knowing the particular occa&s;ions for which they were com|po&s;ed, and the particular circum&s;tances to which they were adapted; and how much of this beauty mu&s;t now be lo&s;t to us, through our imperfect acquaintance with many particulars of the Hebrew hi&s;tory, and Hebrew rites.</P>
<P>THE method of Compo&s;ition which has been explained, by corre&s;pondent ver&s;icles, being univer&s;ally introduced into the Hymns or mu&s;ical Poetry of the Jews, ea&s;ily &s;pread it&s;elf through their other Poetical Writings, which were not de&s;igned to be &s;ung in alter|nate portions, and which therefore did not &s;o much require this mode of Compo&s;ition. But the mode became familiar to their ears, and carried with it a certain &s;olemn maje&s;ty of Style, particularly &s;uited to &s;acred &s;ubjects. Hence, throughout the Prophetical Writings, we find it prevailing as much as in the P&s;alms of David; as, for in&s;tance, in the Prophet I&s;aiah (chap. lx. 1.) <Q REND="inline">"Ari&s;e, &s;hine, for thy light is come&mdash;and the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon thee; For lo! darkne&s;s &s;hall cover the earth,&mdash;and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the people. But the Lord &s;hall ri&s;e upon thee&mdash;and his glory &s;hall be &s;een upon thee, and the Gentiles &s;hall come to thy light&mdash;and kings to the brightne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing."</Q> This form of writing is one of the great characteri&s;tics of the antient Hebrew
<PB N="197" REF="200">
Poetry; very different from, and even oppo|&s;ite to, the Style of the Greek and Roman Poets.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENT of this peculiar mode of con&s;truction, the &s;acred Poetry is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the highe&s;t beauties of &s;trong, conci&s;e, bold, and figurative expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>CONCISENESS and &s;trength, are two of its mo&s;t remarkable characters. One might indeed at fir&s;t imagine, that the practice of the Hebrew Poets, of always amplifying the &s;ame thought, by repetition or contra&s;t, might tend to enfeeble their Style. But they conduct them&s;elves &s;o, as not to produce this effect. Their Sentences are always &s;hort. Few &s;uperfluous words are u&s;ed. The &s;ame thought is never dwelt upon long. To their conci&s;ene&s;s and &s;obriety of expre&s;&s;ion, their Poetry is indebted for much of its &s;ublimity; and all Writers who attempt the Sublime, might profit much, by imitating, in this re&s;|pect, the Style of the Old Te&s;tament. For as I have formerly had occa&s;ion to &s;how, nothing is &s;o great an enemy to the Sublime, as prolixity or diffu&s;ene&s;s. The mind is ne|ver &s;o much affected by any great idea that is pre&s;ented to it, as when it is &s;truck all at once; by attempting to prolong the impre&s;&s;i|on, we at the &s;ame time weaken it. Mo&s;t of the antient original Poets of all nations, are &s;imple and conci&s;e. The &s;uperfluities and excre&s;cencies of Style, were the re&s;ult of
<PB N="198" REF="201">
imitation in after times; when Compo&s;i|tion pa&s;&s;ed into inferior hands, and flowed from art and &s;tudy, more than from native genius.</P>
<P>NO Writings whatever abound &s;o much with the mo&s;t bold and animated figures, as the Sacred Books. It is proper to dwell a little upon this article; as through our early familiarity with the&s;e books, a familiarity too often with the &s;ound of the words, rather than with their &s;en&s;e and meaning, beauties of Style e&s;cape us in the Scripture, which, in any other book, would draw particular attention. Metaphors, Compari&s;ons, Alle|gories, and Per&s;onifications, are there parti|cularly frequent. In order to do ju&s;tice to the&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we tran&s;port our|&s;elves as much as we can into the land of Judaea; and place before our eyes that &s;ce|nery, and tho&s;e objects, with which the He|brew Writers were conver&s;ant. Some atten|tion of this kind is requi&s;ite, in order to re|li&s;h the writings of any Poet of a foreign country, and a different age. For the imagery of every good Poet is copied from nature, and real life; if it were not &s;o, it could not be lively; and therefore, in order to enter into the propriety of his images, we mu&s;t endeavour to place our&s;elves in his &s;ituation. Now we &s;hall find, that the Metaphors and Compari&s;ons of the Hebrew Poets, pre&s;ent to us a very beautiful view of the natural
<PB N="199" REF="202">
objects of their own country, and of the arts and employments of their common life.</P>
<P>NATURAL objects are in &s;ome mea&s;ure common to them with Poets of all ages and countries. Light and darkne&s;s, trees and flowers, the fore&s;t and the cultivated field, &s;ugge&s;t to them many beautiful figures. But, in order to reli&s;h their figures of this kind, we mu&s;t take notice, that &s;everal of them ari&s;e from the particular circum&s;tances of the land of Judaea. During the &s;ummer months, little or no rain falls throughout all that re|gion. While the heats continued, the coun|try was intolerably parched; want of water was a great di&s;tre&s;s; and a plentiful &s;hower falling, or a rivulet breaking forth, altered the whole face of nature, and introduced much higher ideas of refre&s;hment and plea|&s;ure, than the like cau&s;es can &s;ugge&s;t to us. Hence, to repre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch frequent allu&s;ions among&s;t them, <Q REND="inline">"to a dry and thir&s;ty land where no water is;"</Q> and hence to de&s;cribe a change from di&s;tre&s;s to pro&s;pe|rity, their metaphors are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded on the fall|ing of &s;howers, and the bur&s;ting out of &s;prings in the de&s;ert. Thus in I&s;aiah, <Q REND="inline">"The wil|derne&s;s and the &s;olitary place &s;hall be glad, and the de&s;art &s;hall rejoice and blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e. For in the wilderne&s;s &s;hall wa|ters break out, and &s;treams in the de&s;art; and the parched ground &s;hall become a pool; and the thir&s;ty land, &s;prings of wa|ter; in the habitation of dragons there
<PB N="200" REF="203">
&s;hall be gra&s;s, with ru&s;hes and reeds."</Q> Chap. xxxv. i. 6, 7. Images of this nature are very familiar to I&s;aiah, and occur in many parts of his Book.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as Judaea was a hilly country, it was, during the rainy months, expo&s;ed to frequent inundations by the ru&s;hing of tor|rents, which came down &s;uddenly from the mountains, and carried every thing before them; and Jordan, their only great river, annually overflowed its banks. Hence the frequent allu&s;ions to <Q REND="inline">"the noi&s;e, and to the ru&s;hings of many waters";</Q> and hence great calamities &s;o often compared to the over|flowing torrent, which, in &s;uch a country, mu&s;t have been images particularly &s;triking: <Q REND="inline">"Deep calleth unto deep at the noi&s;e of thy water-&s;pouts; all thy waves, and thy bil|lows, are gone over me." <BIBL>P&s;alm xlii. 7.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE two mo&s;t remarkable mountains of the country, were Lebanon and Carmel: the former noted for its height, and the woods of lofty cedars that covered it; the latter for its beauty and fertility, the richne&s;s of its vines and olives. Hence, with the greate&s;t propriety, Lebanon is employed as an image of whatever is great, &s;trong, or magnificent; Carmel, of what is &s;miling and beautiful. <Q REND="inline">"The glory of Lebanon,"</Q> &s;ays I&s;aiah, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall be given to it, and the excel|lency of Carmel." <BIBL>(xxxv. 2.)</BIBL></Q> Lebanon is often put metaphorically for the whole &s;tate
<PB N="201" REF="204">
or people of I&s;rael, for the temple, for the king of A&s;&s;yria; Carmel, for the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and pro&s;perity. <Q REND="inline">"His countenance is as Lebanon,"</Q> &s;ays Solomon, &s;peaking of the dignity of a man's appearance; but when he de&s;cribes female beauty, <Q REND="inline">"Thine head is like mount Carmel." <BIBL>Song, v. 15. and vii. 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>IT is farther to be remarked under this head, that in the images of the awful and terrible kind, with which the Sacred Poets abound, they plainly draw their de&s;criptions from that violence of the elements, and tho&s;e concu&s;&s;ions of nature, with which their cli|mate rendered them acquainted. Earth|quakes were not unfrequent; and the tem|pe&s;ts of hail, thunder, and lightning in Judaea and Arabia, accompanied with whirlwinds and darkne&s;s, far exceed any thing of that &s;ort which happens in more temperate regi|ons. I&s;aiah de&s;cribes, with great maje&s;ty, the earth <Q REND="inline">"reeling to and fro like a drunkard, and removed like a cottage." <BIBL>(xxiv. 20.)</BIBL></Q> And in tho&s;e circum&s;tances of terror, with which an appearance of the Almighty is de|&s;cribed in the 18th P&s;alm, when his <Q REND="inline">"pavi|lion round about him was darkne&s;s; when hail&s;tones and coals of fire were his voice; and when, at his rebuke, the channels of the waters are &s;aid to be &s;een, and the foundations of the hills di&s;covered;"</Q> though there may be &s;ome reference, as Dr. Lowth thinks, to the hi&s;tory of God's de&s;cent upon Mount
<PB N="202" REF="205">
Sinai, yet it &s;eems more probable, that the figures were taken directly from tho&s;e com|motions of nature with which the Author was acquainted, and which &s;ugge&s;ted &s;tronger and nobler images than what now occurs to us.</P>
<P>BESIDES the natural objects of their own country, we find the rites of their religion, and the arts and employments of their com|mon life, frequently employed as grounds of imagery among the Hebrews. They were a people chiefly occupied with agriculture and pa&s;turage. The&s;e were arts held in high ho|nour among them; not di&s;dained by their pa|triarchs, kings, and prophets. Little addicted to commerce; &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world by their laws and their religion; they were, during the better days of their &s;tate, &s;trangers in a great mea&s;ure to the refine|ments of luxury. Hence flowed, of cour&s;e, the many allu&s;ions to pa&s;toral life, to the <Q REND="inline">"green pa&s;tures and the &s;till waters,"</Q> and to the care and watchfulne&s;s of a &s;hepherd over his flock, which carry to this day &s;o much beauty and tenderne&s;s in them, in the 23d P&s;alm, and in many other pa&s;&s;ages of the Poetical Writings of Scripture. Hence, all the images founded upon rural employ|ments, upon the wine pre&s;s, the thre&s;hing floor, the &s;tubble and the chaff. To di&s;re|li&s;h all &s;uch images, is the effect of fal&s;e de|licacy. Homer is at lea&s;t as frequent, and much more minute and particular, in his
<PB N="203" REF="206">
&s;imilies, founded on what we now call low life; but, in his management of them, far inferior to the Sacred Writers, who generally mix with their compari&s;ons of this kind &s;omewhat of dignity and grandeur, to ennoble them. What inexpre&s;&s;ible grandeur does the following rural image in I&s;aiah, for in&s;tance, receive from the intervention of the Deity: <Q REND="inline">"The nations &s;hall ru&s;h like the ru&s;hings of many waters; but God &s;hall rebuke them, and they &s;hall fly far off; and they &s;hall be cha&s;ed as the chaff of the mountain before the wind, and like the down of the thi&s;tle before the whirlwind."</Q></P>
<P>FIGURATIVE allu&s;ions too, we frequently find, to the rites and ceremonies of their religion; to the legal di&s;tinctions of things clean and unclean; to the mode of their Temple Service; to the dre&s;s of their Prie&s;ts; and to the mo&s;t noted incidents recorded in their Sacred Hi&s;tory; as to the de&s;truction of Sodom, the de&s;cent of God upon Mount Sinai, and the miraculous pa&s;&s;age of the I&s;raelites through the Red Sea. The religion of the Hebrews included the whole of their laws, and civil con&s;titution. It was full of &s;plendid external rites, that occupied their &s;en&s;es; it was connected with every part of their national hi&s;tory and e&s;tabli&s;hment; and and hence, all ideas founded on religion, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in this nation a dignity and importance peculiar to them&s;elves, and were uncommon|ly fitted to impre&s;s the imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207">
FROM all this it re&s;ults, that the imagery of the Sacred Poets is, in a high degree, ex|pre&s;&s;ive and natural; it is copied directly from real objects, that were before their eyes; it has this advantage, of being more complete within it&s;elf, more entirely founded on na|tional ideas and manners, than that of mo&s;t other Poets. In reading their works, we find our&s;elves continually in the land of Judaea. The palm-trees, and the cedars of Lebanon, are ever ri&s;ing in our view. The face of their territory, the circum&s;tance of their climate, the manners of the people, and the augu&s;t ceremonies of their religion, con&s;tantly pa&s;s under different forms before us.</P>
<P>THE compari&s;ons employed by the Sacred Poets are generally &s;hort, touching on one point only of re&s;emblance, rather than branch|ing out into little Epi&s;odes. In this re&s;pect, they have perhaps an advantage over the Greek and Roman Authors; who&s;e compari|&s;ons, by the length to which they are extend|ed, &s;ometimes interrupt the narration too much, and carry too vi&s;ible marks of &s;tudy and labour. Whereas, in the Hebrew Poets, they appear more like the glowings of a lively fancy, ju&s;t glancing a&s;ide to &s;ome re&s;embling object, and pre&s;ently returning to its tract. Such is the following fine compari&s;on, intro|duced to de&s;cribe the happy influence of good government upon a people, in what are called the la&s;t words of David, recorded in the 2d Book of Samuel (xxiii. 3.): <Q REND="inline">"He that ruleth
<PB N="205" REF="208">
over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; and he &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth; even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth, by clear &s;hining after rain."</Q> This is one of the mo&s;t regu|lar and formal compari&s;ons in the Sacred Books.</P>
<P>ALLEGORY, likewi&s;e, is a figure frequent|ly found in them. When formerly treating of this figure, I gave, for an in&s;tance of it, that remarkably fine and well &s;upported Al|legory, which occurs in the 80th P&s;alm, wherein the People of I&s;rael are compared to a vine. Of Parables, which form a &s;pecies of Allegory, the Prophetical Writings are full: and if to us they &s;ometimes appear ob|&s;cure, we mu&s;t remember, that in the&s;e early times, it was univer&s;ally the mode throughout all the ea&s;tern nations, to convey &s;acred truths under my&s;terious figures and repre&s;en|tations.</P>
<P>BUT the Poetical Figure, which, beyond all others, elevates the Style of Scripture, and gives it a peculiar boldne&s;s and &s;ublimity, is Pro&s;o|popoeia or Per&s;onification. No Per&s;onifications employed by any Poets, are &s;o magnificent and &s;triking as tho&s;e of the In&s;pired Writers. On great occa&s;ions, they animate every part of na|ture; e&s;pecially, when any appearance or opera|tion of the Almighty is concerned. <Q REND="inline">"Before him went the pe&s;tilence&mdash;the waters &s;aw thee,
<PB N="206" REF="209">
O God, and were afraid&mdash;the mountains &s;aw thee, and they trembled.&mdash;The over|flowing of the water pa&s;&s;ed by;&mdash;the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands high."</Q> When enquiry is made about the place of wi&s;dom, Job introduces the <Q REND="inline">"Deep, &s;aying, it is not in me; and the &s;ea &s;aith, it is not in me. De&s;truction and death &s;ay, we have heard the fame thereof with our ears."</Q> That noted &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age in the Book of I&s;aiah, which de&s;cribes the fall of the King of A&s;&s;yria, is full of per&s;onified ob|jects; the fir-trees and cedars of Lebanon breaking forth into exultation on the fall of the tyrant; Hell from beneath, &s;tirring up all the dead to meet him at his coming; and the dead Kings introduced as &s;peaking, and join|ing in the triumph. In the &s;ame &s;train, are the&s;e many lively and pa&s;&s;ionate apo&s;trophes to cities and countries, to per&s;ons and things, with which the Prophetical Writings every where abound. <Q REND="inline">"O thou &s;word of the Lord! how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put thy&s;elf up into the &s;cabbard, re&s;t and be &s;till. How can it be quiet,"</Q> (as the reply is in&s;tantly made) <Q REND="inline">"&s;eeing the Lord hath given it a charge again&s;t A&s;kelon, and the &s;ea-&s;hore? there hath he appointed it." <BIBL>Jerem. xlvii. 6.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>IN general, for it would carry us too far to enlarge upon all the in&s;tances, the Style of the Poetical Books of the Old Te&s;tament is, beyond the Style of all other Poetical Works,
<PB N="207" REF="210">
fervid, bold, and animated. It is extremely different from that regular correct expre&s;&s;ion, to which our ears are accu&s;tomed in Modern Poetry. It is the bur&s;t of In&s;piration. The &s;cenes are not coolly de&s;cribed, but repre&s;ent|ed as pa&s;&s;ing before our eyes. Every object, and every per&s;on, is addre&s;&s;ed and &s;poken to, as if pre&s;ent. The tran&s;ition is often abrupt; the connection often ob&s;cure; the per&s;ons are often changed; figures crowded, and heaped upon one another. Bold &s;ublimity, not cor|rect elegance, is its character. We &s;ee the &s;pirit of the Writer rai&s;ed beyond him&s;elf, and labouring to find vent for ideas too mighty for his utterance.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e remarks on the Poetry of the Scriptures in general, I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;&s;ertation, with a &s;hort account of the dif|ferent kinds of Poetical Compo&s;ition in the Sacred Books; and of the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racters of &s;ome of the chief Writers.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal kinds of Poetical Compo&s;ition which we find in Scripture, are chiefly the Didactic, Elegiac, Pa&s;toral, and Lyric. Of the Didactic &s;pecies of Poetry, the Book of Proverbs is the principal in&s;tance. The nine fir&s;t Chapters of that Book are highly poetical, adorned with many di&s;tingui&s;hed graces, and figures of expre&s;&s;ion. At the 10th Chapter, the Style is &s;en&s;ibly altered, and de&s;cends into a lower &s;train, which is continued to the end; retaining however that &s;ententious, pointed
<PB N="208" REF="211">
manner, and that artful con&s;truction of period, which di&s;tingui&s;hes all the Hebrew Poetry. The Book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes comes likewi&s;e un|der this head; and &s;ome of the P&s;alms, as the 119th in particular.</P>
<P>OF Elegiac Poetry, many very beautiful &s;pecimens occur in Scripture; &s;uch as the La|mentation of David over his friend Jonathan; &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the Prophetical Books; and &s;everal of David's P&s;alms, compo&s;ed on occa&s;ions of di&s;tre&s;s and mourning. The 42d P&s;alm, in particular, is, in the highe&s;t degree, tender and plaintive. But the mo&s;t regular and perfect Elegiac Compo&s;ition in the Scrip|ture, perhaps in the whole world, is the Book, entitled the Lamentations of Jeremiah. As the Prophet mourns in that book over the de&s;truction of the Temple, and the Holy City, and the overthrow of the whole State, he a&s;&s;embles all the affecting images which a &s;ubject &s;o melancholy could &s;ugge&s;t. The Compo&s;ition is uncommonly artificial. By turns the Prophet, and the City of Jeru&s;alem, are introduced, as pouring forth their &s;orrows; and, in the end, a chorus of the people &s;end up the mo&s;t earne&s;t and plaintive &s;upplicati|ons to God. The lines of the original too, as may, in part, appear from our tran&s;lation, are longer than is u&s;ual in the other kinds of Hebrew Poetry; and the melody is rendered thereby more flowing, and better adapted to the querimonious &s;train of Elegy.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="212">
THE Song of Solomon affords us a high exemplification of Pa&s;toral Poetry. Con&s;i|dered with re&s;pect to its &s;piritual meaning, it is undoubtedly a my&s;tical Allegory; in its form, it is a Dramatic Pa&s;toral, or a perpe|tual Dialogue between per&s;onages in the cha|racter of Shepherds; and, &s;uitably to that form, it is full of rural and pa&s;toral images, from beginning to end.</P>
<P>OF Lyric Poetry, or that which is intend|ed to be accompanied with Mu&s;ic, the Old Te&s;tament is full. Be&s;ides a great number of Hymns and Songs, which we find &s;cattered in the Hi&s;torical and Prophetical Books, &s;uch as the Song of Mo&s;es, the Song of Deborah, and many others of like nature, the whole Book of P&s;alms is to be con&s;idered as a col|lection of Sacred Odes. In the&s;e, we find the Ode exhibited in all the varieties of its form, and &s;upported with the highe&s;t &s;pirit of Lyric Poetry; &s;ometimes &s;prightly, cheerful, and tri|umphant; &s;ometimes &s;olemn and magnificent; &s;ometimes tender and &s;oft. From the&s;e in|&s;tances, it clearly appears, that there are contained in the Holy Scriptures, full exem|plifications of &s;everal of the chief kinds of Poetical Writing.</P>
<P>AMONG the different Compo&s;ers of the Sacred Books, there is an evident diver&s;ity of &s;tyle and manner; and to trace their different characters in this view, will contribute not a little towards our reading their Writings with
<PB N="210" REF="213">
greater advantage. The mo&s;t eminent of the Sacred Poets are, the Author of the Book of Job, David, and I&s;aiah. As the Compo&s;itions of David are of the Lyric kind, there is a greater variety of &s;tyle and manner in his works, than in tho&s;e of the other two. The manner in which, con&s;idered merely as a Poet, David chiefly excels, is the plea&s;ing, the &s;oft, and the tender. In his P&s;alms, there are many lofty and &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ages; but, in &s;trength of de&s;cription, he yields to Job; in &s;ublimi|ty, he yields to I&s;aiah. It is a &s;ort of tempe|rate grandeur, for which David is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed; and to this he always &s;oon re|turns, when, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, he ri&s;es above it. The P&s;alms in which he touches us mo&s;t, are tho&s;e in which he de&s;cribes the happine&s;s of the righteous, or the goodne&s;s of God; expre&s;&s;es the tender breathings of a devout mind, or &s;ends up moving and affec|tionate &s;upplications to Heaven. I&s;aiah is, without exception, the mo&s;t &s;ublime of all Poets. This is abundantly vi&s;ible in our Tran&s;lation; and what is a material circum|&s;tance, none of the Books of Scripture appear to have been more happily tran&s;lated than the Writings of this Prophet. Maje&s;ty is his reigning character; a Maje&s;ty more com|manding, and more uniformly &s;upported, than is to be found among the re&s;t of the Old Te&s;tament Poets. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, indeed, a dignity and grandeur, both in his concepti|ons and expre&s;&s;ions, which is altogether un|paralleled, and peculiar to him&s;elf. There is
<PB N="211" REF="214">
more clearne&s;s and order too, and a more vi&s;ible di&s;tribution of parts, in his Book, than in any other of the Prophetical Writ|ings.</P>
<P>WHEN we compare him with the re&s;t of the Poetical Prophets, we immediately &s;ee in Jeremiah, a very different genius. I&s;aiah em|ploys him&s;elf generally on magnificent &s;ubjects. Jeremiah has little turn for the &s;ublime, and inclines always to the tender and elegiac. Ezechiel, in poetical grace and elegance, is much inferior to them both; but he is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a character of uncommon force and ardour. To u&s;e the elegant expre&s;&s;ions of Bi&s;hop Lowth, with regard to this Pro|phet: <Q REND="inline">"E&s;t atrox, vehemens, tragicus; in &s;en&s;ibus, fervidus, acerbus, indignabundus; in imaginibus fecundus, truculentus, et nonnunquam pen&egrave; deformis; in dictione grandiloquus, gravis, au&s;terus, et interdum incultus; frequens in repetitionibus, non decoris aut gratiae cau&s;a, &s;ed ex indigna|tione et violentia. Quicquid &s;u&s;ceperit tractandum id &s;edul&ograve; per&s;equitur; in eo unic&egrave; haeret defixus; a propo&s;ito raro de|flectens. In caeteris, a pleri&s;que vatibus forta&s;&s;e &s;uperatus; &s;ed in eo genere, ad quod videtur a natura unice comparatus, nimirum, vi, pondere, impetu, granditate, nemo unquam eum &s;uperavit."</Q> The &s;ame learned Writer compares I&s;aiah to Homer, Jeremiah to Simonides, and Ezechiel to Ae&s;chylus. Mo&s;t of the Book of I&s;aiah is
<PB N="212" REF="215">
&s;trictly poetical; of Jeremiah and Ezechiel, not above one half can be held to belong to Poetry. Among the Minor Prophets, Ho&s;ea, Joel, Michah, Habakkuk, and e&s;pecially Nahum, are di&s;tingui&s;hed for poetical &s;pirit. In the Prophecies of Daniel and Jonah, there is no Poetry.</P>
<P>IT only now remains to &s;peak of the Book of Job, with which I &s;hall conclude. It is known to be extremely ancient; generally reputed the mo&s;t ancient of all the Poetical Books; the Author uncertain. It is remark|able, that this book has no connection with the affairs, or manners of the Jews, or He|brews. The &s;cene is laid in the land of Uz, or Idumaea, which is a part of Arabia; and the imagery employed is generally of a diffe|rent kind, from what I before &s;howed to be peculiar to the Hebrew Poets. We meet with no allu&s;ions to the great events of Sacred Hi&s;tory, to the religious rites of the Jews, to Lebanon or to Carmel, or any of the peculia|rities of the climate of Judaea. We find few compari&s;ons founded on rivers or torrents; the&s;e were not familiar objects in Arabia. But the longe&s;t compari&s;on that occurs in the Book, is to an object frequent and well known in that region, a brook that fails in the &s;ea&s;on of heat, and di&s;appoints the ex|pectation of the traveller.</P>
<P>THE Poetry, however, of the Book of Job, is not only equal to that of any other of
<PB N="213" REF="216">
the Sacred Writings, but is &s;uperior to them all, except tho&s;e of I&s;aiah alone. As I&s;aiah is the mo&s;t &s;ublime, David the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and tender, &s;o Job is the mo&s;t de&s;criptive, of all the In&s;pired Poets. A peculiar glow of fancy, and &s;trength of de&s;cription, characte|ri&s;e the Author. No Writer whatever abounds &s;o much in Metaphors. He may be &s;aid, not to de&s;cribe, but to render vi&s;ible, whatever he treats of. A variety of in&s;tan|ces might be given. Let us remark only tho&s;e &s;trong and lively colours, with which, in the following pa&s;&s;ages, taken from the 18th and 20th Chapters of his Book, he paints the condition of the wicked; ob&s;erve how rapidly his figures ri&s;e before us; and what a deep impre&s;&s;ion, at the &s;ame time, they leave on the imagination. <Q REND="inline">"Knowe&s;t thou not this of old, &s;ince man was placed upon the earth, that the triumphing of the wicked is &s;hort, and the joy of the hypocrite, but for a moment? Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach the clouds, yet he &s;hall peri&s;h for ever. He &s;hall flie away as a dream, and &s;hall not be found; yea, he &s;hall be cha&s;ed away, as a vi&s;ion of the night. The eye al&s;o which &s;aw him, &s;hall &s;ee him no more; they which have &s;een him, &s;hall &s;ay, where is he?&mdash;He &s;hall &s;uck the poi&s;on of a&s;ps; the viper's tongue &s;hall &s;lay him. In the fulne&s;s of his &s;ufficiency, he &s;hall be in &s;traits; every hand &s;hall come upon him.
<PB N="214" REF="217">
He &s;hall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of &s;teel &s;hall &s;trike him through. All darkne&s;s &s;hall be hid in his &s;ecret places. A fire not blown &s;hall con&s;ume him. The Heaven &s;hall reveal his iniquity, and the Earth &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t him. The In|crea&s;e of his hou&s;e &s;hall depart. His goods &s;hall flow away in the day of wrath. The light of the wicked &s;hall be put out; the light &s;hall be dark in his tabernacle. The &s;teps of his &s;trength &s;hall be &s;traitened, and his own coun&s;el &s;hall ca&s;t him down. For he is ca&s;t into a net, by his own feet. He walketh upon a &s;nare. Terrors &s;hall make him afraid on every &s;ide; and the robber &s;hall prevail again&s;t him. Brim|&s;tone &s;hall be &s;cattered upon his habitation. His remembrance &s;hall peri&s;h from the earth, and he &s;hall have no name in the &s;treet. He &s;hall be driven from light into darkne&s;s.

<HEAD>LECTURE XLII. EPIC POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>IT now remains to treat of the two highe&s;t kinds of Poetical Writing, the Epic and the Dramatic. I begin with the Epic. This Lecture &s;hall be employed upon the general principles of that Species of Compo&s;ition: after which, I &s;hall take a view of the cha|racter and genius of the mo&s;t celebrated Epic Poets.</P>
<P>THE Epic Poem is univer&s;ally allowed to be, of all poetical works, the mo&s;t dignified, and, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t difficult in execution. To contrive a &s;tory which &s;hall plea&s;e and intere&s;t all Readers, by being at once entertaining, important, and in&s;truc|tive; to fill it with &s;uitable incidents; to en|liven it with a variety of characters, and of de&s;criptions; and, throughout a long work,
<PB N="216" REF="219">
to maintain that propriety of &s;entiment, and that elevation of Style, which the Epic Cha|racter requires, is unque&s;tionably the highe&s;t effort of Poetical Genius. Hence &s;o very few have &s;ucceeded in the attempt, that &s;trict Critics will hardly allow any other Poems to bear the name of Epic except the Iliad, and the Aeneid.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, on which Critics have di&s;played more pedan|try, than on this. By tedious Di&s;qui&s;itions, founded on a &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority, they have given &s;uch an air of my&s;tery to a plain &s;ubject, as to render it difficult for an ordinary Reader to conceive, what an Epic Poem is. By Bo&s;&s;u's definition, it is a Di&s;|cour&s;e invented by art, purely to form the manners of men, by means of in&s;tructions di&s;gui&s;ed under the allegory of &s;ome impor|tant action, which is related in Ver&s;e. This definition would &s;uit &s;everal of Ae&s;op's Fa|bles, if they were &s;omewhat extended, and put into Ver&s;e: and, accordingly, to illu&s;trate his definition, the Critic draws a parallel, in form, between the con&s;truction of one of Ae&s;op's Fables, and the plan of Homer's Iliad. The fir&s;t thing, &s;ays he, which either a Writer of Fables, or of Heroic Poems, does, is, to choo&s;e &s;ome maxim or point of morality; to inculcate which, is to be the de&s;ign of his work. Next, he invents a ge|neral &s;tory, or a &s;eries of facts, without any names, &s;uch as he judges will be mo&s;t proper
<PB N="217" REF="220">
for illu&s;trating his intended Moral. La&s;tly, he particulari&s;es his &s;tory; that is, if he be a Fabuli&s;t, he introduces his dog, his &s;heep, and his wolf; or if he be an Epic Poet, he looks out in Antient Hi&s;tory for &s;ome proper names of heroes to give to his actors; and then his plan is completed.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t frigid, and ab&s;urd ideas, that ever entered into the mind of a Critic. Homer, he &s;ays, &s;aw the Grecians divided into a great number of independent States; but very often obliged to unite into one body again&s;t their common enemies. The mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;truction which he could give them in this &s;ituation, was, that a mi&s;|under&s;tanding between princes is the ruin of the common cau&s;e. In order to enforce this in&s;truction, he contrived, in his own mind, &s;uch a general &s;tory as this. Several princes join in a confederacy again&s;t their enemy. The prince, who was cho&s;en as the leader of the re&s;t, affronts one of the mo&s;t valiant of the confederates, who thereupon withdraws him&s;elf, and refu&s;es to take part in the com|mon enterprize. Great misfortunes are the con&s;equence of this divi&s;ion; till, at length, both parties having &s;uffered by the quarrel, the offended prince forgets his di&s;plea&s;ure, and is reconciled to the leader; and union being once re&s;tored, there en&s;ues complete victory over their enemies. Upon this gene|ral plan of his Fable, adds Bo&s;&s;u, it was of no great con&s;equence, whether, in filling it
<PB N="218" REF="221">
up, Homer had employed the names of bea&s;ts, like Ae&s;op, or of men. He would have been equally in&s;tructive, either way. But as he rather fancied to write of heroes, he pitched upon the war of Troy for the &s;cene of his Fable; he feigned &s;uch an action to happen there; he gave the name of Agamemnon, to the common leader; that of Achilles, to the offended prince; and &s;o the Iliad aro&s;e.</P>
<P>HE that can believe Homer to have pro|ceeded in this manner, may believe any thing. One may pronounce, with great cer|tainty, that an Author who &s;hould compo&s;e according to &s;uch a plan; who &s;hould arrange all the &s;ubject, in his own mind, with a view to the moral, before he had ever thought of the per&s;onages who were to be his Actors, might write, perhaps, u&s;eful Fables for chil|dren; but as to an Epic Poem, if he adven|tured to think of one, it would be &s;uch as would find few Readers. No per&s;on of any ta&s;te can entertain a doubt, that the fir&s;t ob|jects which &s;trike an Epic Poet are, the Hero whom he is to celebrate, and the Action, or Story, which is to be the ground-work of his Poem. He does not &s;it down, like a Philo|&s;opher, to form the plan of a Treati&s;e of Mo|rality. His genius is fired by &s;ome great en|terprize, which, to him, appears noble and intere&s;ting; and which, therefore, he pitches upon, as worthy of being celebrated in the highe&s;t &s;train of Poetry. There is no &s;ubject of this kind, but will always afford &s;ome ge|neral
<PB N="219" REF="222">
moral in&s;truction, ari&s;ing from it natu|rally. The in&s;truction which Bo&s;&s;u points out, is certainly &s;ugge&s;ted by the Iliad; and there is another which ari&s;es as naturally, and may ju&s;t as well be a&s;&s;igned for the moral of that Poem; namely, that Providence avenges tho&s;e who have &s;uffered inju&s;tice; but that when they allow their re&s;entment to carry them too far, it brings misfortunes upon them&s;elves. The &s;ubject of the Poem is the wrath of Achilles, cau&s;ed by the inju&s;tice of Agamemnon. Jupiter avenges Achilles by giving &s;ucce&s;s to the Trojans again&s;t Aga|memnon; but by continuing ob&s;tinate in his re&s;entment, Achilles lo&s;es his beloved friend Patroclus.</P>
<P>THE plain account of the nature of an Epic Poem is, the recital of &s;ome illu&s;trious enter|pri&s;e in a Poetical Form. This is as exact a definition, as there is any occa&s;ion for on this &s;ubject. It comprehends &s;everal other Poems be&s;ides the Iliad of Homer, the Aeneid of Virgil, and the Jeru&s;alem of Ta&s;&s;o; which are, perhaps, the three mo&s;t regular and com|plete Epic Works that ever were compo&s;ed. But to exclude all Poems from the Epic Cla&s;s, which are not formed exactly upon the &s;ame model as the&s;e, is the pedantry of Critici&s;m. We can give exact definitions, and de&s;cripti|ons of minerals, plants, and animals; and can arrange them with preci&s;ion, under the different cla&s;&s;es to which they belong, becau&s;e Nature affords a vi&s;ible unvarying &s;tandard,
<PB N="220" REF="223">
to which we refer them. But with regard to works of ta&s;te and imagination, where Na|ture has fixed no &s;tandard, but leaves &s;cope for beauties of many different kinds, it is ab|&s;urd to attempt defining, and limiting them, with the &s;ame preci&s;ion. Critici&s;m, when employed in &s;uch attempts, degenerates into trifling que&s;tions about words and names only. I therefore have no &s;cruple to cla&s;s &s;uch Po|ems, as Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, Lucan's Phar&s;alia, Statius's Thebaid, O&s;&s;ian's Fingal and Temora, Camoen's Lu&s;iad, Voltaire's Henriade, Cambray's Telemachus, Glover's Leonidas, Wilkie's Epigoniad, under the &s;ame &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition with the Iliad and the Aeneid; though &s;ome of them ap|proach much nearer than others, to the perfection of the&s;e celebrated Works. They are, undoubtedly, all Epic; that is, poetical recitals of great adventures; which is all that is meant by this denomination of Poetry.</P>
<P>THOUGH I cannot, by any means, allow, that it is the e&s;&s;ence of an Epic Poem to be wholly an Allegory, or a Fable contrived to il|lu&s;trate &s;ome moral truth, yet it is certain, that no Poetry is of a more moral nature than this. Its effect in promoting virtue, is not to be mea&s;ured by any one maxim, or in&s;truction, which re&s;ults from the whole &s;tory, like the moral of one of Ae&s;op's Fables. This is a poor and trivial view of the advantage to be derived from peru&s;ing a long Epic Work,
<PB N="221" REF="224">
that, at the end, we &s;hall be able to gather from it &s;ome common-place morality. Its ef|fect ari&s;es, from the impre&s;&s;ion which the parts of the Poem &s;eparately, as well as the whole taken together, make upon the mind of the Reader; from the great examples which it &s;ets before us, and the high &s;enti|ments with which it warms our hearts. The end which it propo&s;es, is to extend our ideas of human perfection; or, in other words, to excite admiration. Now this can be accom+pli&s;hed only, by proper repre&s;entations of heroic deeds, and virtuous characters. For high virtue is the object, which all mankind are formed to admire; and, therefore, Epic Poems are, and mu&s;t be, favourable to the cau&s;e of virtue. Valour, Truth, Ju&s;tice, Fi|delity, Friend&s;hip, Piety, Magnanimity, are the objects which, in the cour&s;e of &s;uch Com|po&s; tions, are pre&s;ented to our minds, under the mo&s;t &s;plendid and honourable colours. In behalf of virtuous per&s;onages, our affec|tions are engaged; in their de&s;igns, and their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, we are intere&s;ted; the generous and public affections are awakened; the mind is purified from &s;en&s;ual and mean pur|&s;uits, and accu&s;tomed to take part in great, heroic enterpri&s;es. It is, indeed, no &s;mall te&s;timony in honour of virtue, that &s;everal of the mo&s;t refined and elegant entertain|ments of mankind, &s;uch as that &s;pecies of Poetical Compo&s;ition which we now con&s;i|der, mu&s;t be grounded on moral &s;entiments and impre&s;&s;ions. This is a te&s;timony of &s;uch
<PB N="222" REF="225">
weight, that, were it in the power of &s;cepti|cal Philo&s;ophers, to weaken the force of tho&s;e rea&s;onings which e&s;tabli&s;h the e&s;&s;ential di&s;|tinction between Vice and Virtue, the writ|ings of Epic Poets alone were &s;ufficient to refute their fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy; &s;howing, by that appeal which they con&s;tantly make to the feelings of mankind in favour of virtue, that the foundations of it are laid, deep and &s;trong, in human nature.</P>
<P>THE general &s;train and &s;pirit of Epic Com|po&s;ition, &s;ufficiently mark its di&s;tinction from the other kinds of Poetry. In Pa&s;toral Writing, the reigning idea is, innocence and tranquillity. Compa&s;&s;ion, is the great ob|ject of Tragedy; Ridicule, the province of Comedy. The predominant character of the Epic, is admiration excited by heroic actions. It is &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from Hi&s;tory, both by its poetical form, and the liberty of fiction which it a&s;&s;umes. It is a more calm compo&s;ition than Tragedy. It admits, nay requires, the pathetic and the violent, on particular occa&s;ions; but the pathetic is not expected to be its general character. It re|quires, more than any other &s;pecies of Poe|try, a grave, equal, and &s;upported dignity. It takes in a greater compa&s;s of time and ac|tion, than Dramatic writing admits; and thereby allows a more full di&s;play of charac|ters. Dramatic Writing, di&s;plays charac|ters chiefly by means of &s;entiments and pa&s;|&s;ions; Epic Poetry, chiefly by means of ac|tions. The emotions, therefore, which it
<PB N="223" REF="226">
rai&s;es, are not &s;o violent, but they are more prolonged.&mdash;The&s;e are the general charac|teri&s;tics of this &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition. But, in order to give a more particular and cri|tical view of it, let us con&s;ider the Epic Poem under three heads; fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to the Subject, or Action; &s;econdly, with re&s;pect to the Actors, or Characters; and la&s;tly, with re&s;pect to the Narration of the Poet.</P>
<P>THE Action, or Subject of the Epic Poem, mu&s;t have three properties; it mu&s;t be one; it mu&s;t be great; it mu&s;t be intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>FIRST, It mu&s;t be one Action, or Enter|pri&s;e, which the Poet choo&s;es for his &s;ubject. I have frequently had occa&s;ion to remark the importance of unity, in many kinds of Com|po&s;ition, in order to make a full and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind. With the high|e&s;t rea&s;on, Ari&s;totle in&s;i&s;ts upon this, as e&s;|&s;ential to Epic Poetry; and it is, indeed, the mo&s;t material of all his rules re&s;pecting it. For it is certain, that, in the recital of heroic adventures, &s;everal &s;cattered and independent facts can never affect a Reader &s;o deeply, nor engage his attention &s;o &s;trongly, as a tale that is one and connected, where the &s;everal incidents hang upon one another, and are all made to con&s;pire for the accompli&s;h|ment of one end. In a regular Epic, the more that this unity is rendered &s;en&s;ible to the imagination, the effect will be the better:
<PB N="224" REF="227">
and for this rea&s;on, as Ari&s;totle has ob&s;erved, it is not &s;ufficient for the Poet to confine him&s;elf to the actions of one man, or to tho&s;e which happened during a certain period of time; but the unity mu&s;t lie in the &s;ubject it&s;elf; and ari&s;e from all the parts combining into one whole.</P>
<P>IN all the great Epic Poems, unity of action is &s;ufficiently apparent. Virgil, for in&s;tance, has cho&s;en, for his &s;ubject, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Aeneas in Italy, From the beginning to the end of the Poem, this object is ever in our view, and links all the parts of it toge|ther with full connection. The unity of the Ody&s;&s;ey is of the &s;ame nature; the return and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Uly&s;&s;es in his own country. The &s;ubject of Ta&s;&s;o, is the reco|very of Jeru&s;alem from the Infidels; that of Milton, the expul&s;ion of our fir&s;t parents from Paradi&s;e; and both of them are unex|ceptionable in the unity of the Story. The profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubject of the Iliad, is the anger of Achilles, with the con&s;equences which it produced. The Greeks carry on many un|&s;ucce&s;sful engagements again&s;t the Trojans, as long as they are deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Achilles. Upon his being appea&s;ed and reconciled to Agamemnon, victory follows, and the Poem clo&s;es. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that the unity, or connecting prin|ciple, is not quite &s;o &s;en&s;ible to the imagi|nation here, as in the Aeneid. For, through|out many books of the Iliad, Achilles is out
<PB N="225" REF="228">
of &s;ight; he is lo&s;t in inaction, and the fancy terminates on no other object, than the &s;ucce&s;s of the two armies whom we &s;ee contending in war.</P>
<P>THE unity of the Epic Action is not to be &s;o &s;trictly interpreted, as if it excluded all Epi&s;odes, or &s;ubordinate actions. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that the term Epi&s;ode is employed by Ari&s;totle, in a different &s;en&s;e from what we now give to it. It was a term originally applied to Dramatic Poetry, and thence transferred to Epic; and by Epi&s;odes, in an Epic Poem, it would &s;eem that Ari&s;to|tle under&s;tood the exten&s;ion of the general Fable, or plan of the Poem, into all its cir|cum&s;tances. What his meaning was, is in|deed not very clear; and this ob&s;curity has occa&s;ioned much altercation among Critical Writers. Bo&s;&s;u, in particular, is &s;o perplexed upon this &s;ubject, as to be unintelligible. But, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;o fruitle&s;s a controver&s;y, what we now under&s;tand by Epi&s;odes, are certain actions, or incidents, introduced into the narration, connected with the principal action, yet not &s;o e&s;&s;ential to it, as to de|&s;troy, if they had been omitted, the mean &s;ubject of the Poem. Of this nature are the interview of Hector with Andro|mache, in the Iliad; the &s;tory of Cacus, and that of Ni&s;us and Euryalus, in the Aeneid; the adventures of Tancred with Erminia and Clorinda, in the Jeru&s;alem; and the pro&s;pect
<PB N="226" REF="229">
of his de&s;cendants exhibited to Adam, in the la&s;t books of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</P>
<P>SUCH Epi&s;odes as the&s;e, are not only per|mitted to an Epic Poet; but provided they be properly executed, are great ornaments to his work. The rules regarding them are the following:</P>
<P>FIRST, They mu&s;t be naturally intro|duced; they mu&s;t have a &s;ufficient connec|tion with the &s;ubject of the Poem; they mu&s;t &s;eem inferior parts that belong to it; not mere appendages &s;tuck to it. The Epi|&s;ode of Olindo and Sophronia, in the &s;econd book of Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem, is faulty, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this rule. It is too detached from the re&s;t of the work; and being intro|duced &s;o near the opening of the Poem, mi&s;leads the Reader into an expectation, that it is to be of &s;ome future con&s;equence; whereas, it proves to be connected with no|thing that follows. In proportion as any Epi&s;ode is &s;lightly related to the mean &s;ub|ject, it &s;hould always be the &s;horter. The pa&s;&s;ion of Dido in the Aeneid, and the &s;nares of Armida in the Jeru&s;alem, which are ex|panded &s;o fully in the&s;e Poems, cannot, with propriety, be called Epi&s;odes. They are con&s;tituent parts of the work, and form a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the intrigue of the Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="230">
IN the next place, Epi&s;odes ought to pre|&s;ent to us, objects of a different kind, from tho&s;e which go before, and tho&s;e which fol|low, in the cour&s;e of the Poem. For, it is principally for the &s;ake of variety, that Epi|&s;odes are introduced into an Epic Compo&s;i|tion. In &s;o long a work, they tend to diver|&s;ify the &s;ubject, and to relieve the Reader, by &s;hifting the &s;cene. In the mid&s;t of com|bats, therefore, and Epi&s;ode of the martial kind would be out of place; whereas, Hec|tor's vi&s;it to Andromache in the Iliad, and Erminia's adventure with the Shepherd in the &s;eventh book of the Jeru&s;alem, afford us a well-judged and plea&s;ing retreat from camps and battles.</P>
<P>LASTLY, As an Epi&s;ode is a profe&s;&s;ed embelli&s;hment, it ought to be particularly elegant and well fini&s;hed; and, accordingly, it is, for the mo&s;t part, in pieces of this kind, that Poets put forth their &s;trength. The Epi&s;odes of Teribazus and Ariana, in Leonidas, and of the death of Hercules, in the Epigoniad, are the two greate&s;t beauties in the&s;e Poems.</P>
<P>THE unity of the Epic Action nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that the action be entire and com|plete; that is, as Ari&s;totle well expre&s;&s;es it, that it have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Either by relating the whole, in his own per&s;on, or by introducing &s;ome of his Actors to relate what had pa&s;&s;ed before the
<PB N="228" REF="231">
opening of the Poem, the Author mu&s;t al|ways contrive to give us full information of every thing that belongs to his &s;ubject; he mu&s;t not leave our curio&s;ity, in any article, ungratified; he mu&s;t bring us preci&s;ely to the accompli&s;hment of his plan; and then conclude.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd property of the Epic Action, is, that it be great; that it have &s;ufficient &s;plendour and importance, both to fix our attention, and to ju&s;tify the magnificent ap|paratus which the Poet be&s;tows upon it. This is &s;o evidently requi&s;ite as not to re|quire illu&s;tration; and, indeed, hardly any who have attempted Epic Poetry, have failed in choo&s;ing &s;ome &s;ubject &s;ufficiently impor|tant, either by the nature of the action, or by the fame of the per&s;onages concerned in it.</P>
<P>IT contributes to the grandeur of the Epic Subject, that it be not of a modern date, nor fall within any period of hi&s;tory with which we are intimately acquainted. Both Lucan and Voltaire have, in the choice of their &s;ub|jects, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed this rule, and they have, upon that account, &s;ucceeded wor&s;e. Anti|quity is favourable to tho&s;e high and augu&s;t ideas, which Epic Poetry is de&s;igned to rai&s;e. It tends to aggrandi&s;e, in our imagination, both per&s;ons and events; and what is &s;till more material, it allows the Poet the liberty of adorning his &s;ubject by means of fiction. Whereas, as &s;oon as he comes within the verge of real and authenticated hi&s;tory, this
<PB N="229" REF="232">
liberty is abridged. He mu&s;t either confine him&s;elf wholly, as Lucan has done, to &s;trict hi&s;torical truth, at the expence of rendering his &s;tory jejune; or if he goes beyond it, like Voltaire in his Henriade, this di&s;advantage follows, that, in well-known events, the true and the fictitious parts of the plan do not na|turally mingle, and incorporate with each other. The&s;e ob&s;ervations cannot be ap|plied to Dramatic Writing; where the per|&s;onages are exhibited to us, not &s;o much that we may admire, as that we may love or pity them. Such pa&s;&s;ions are much more con|&s;i&s;tent with the familiar hi&s;torical knowledge of the per&s;ons who are to be the objects of them; and even require them to be di&s;played in the light, and with the failings, of ordinary men. Modern, and well-known hi&s;tory, therefore, may furni&s;h very proper materials for tragedy. But for Epic Poetry, where Heroi&s;m is the ground-work, and where the object in view, is to excite admiration, an|cient or traditionary hi&s;tory is a&s;&s;uredly the &s;afe&s;t region. There, the Author may lay hold on names and characters, and events, not wholly unknown, on which to build his Story, while, at the &s;ame time, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance of the period, or of the remote|ne&s;s of the &s;cene, &s;ufficient licence is left him for fiction and invention.</P>
<P>THE third property required in the Epic Poem, is, that it be intere&s;ting. It is not &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e that it be great.
<PB N="230" REF="233">
For deeds of mere valour, how heroic &s;oever, may prove cold and tire&s;ome. Much will depend on the happy choice of &s;ome &s;ubject, which &s;hall, by its nature, intere&s;t the Public; as when the Poet &s;elects for his Hero, one who is the founder, or the deliverer, or the favourite of his nation; or when he writes of atchievements that have been highly cele|brated, or have been connected with with important con&s;equences to any public cau&s;e. Mo&s;t of the great Epic Poems are abundantly fortunate in this re&s;pect, and mu&s;t have been very intere&s;ting to tho&s;e ages and countries in which they were compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT the chief circum&s;tance which renders an Epic Poem intere&s;ting, and which tends to intere&s;t, not one age or country alone, but all Readers, is the &s;kilful conduct of the Au|thor in the management of his &s;ubject. He mu&s;t &s;o contrive his plan, as that it &s;hall comprehend many affecting incidents, He mu&s;t not dazzle us perpetually with valiant atchievements; for all Readers tire of con|&s;tant fighting and battles; but he mu&s;t &s;tudy to touch our hearts. He may &s;ometimes be awful and augu&s;t; he mu&s;t often be tender and pathetic; he mu&s;t give us gentle and plea&s;ing &s;cenes of love, friend&s;hip, and af|fection. The more that an Epic Poem a|bound with &s;ituations which awaken the feelings of humanity, it is the more intere&s;t|ing; and the&s;e form, always, the favourite pa&s;&s;ages of the work. I know no Epic
<PB N="231" REF="234">
Poets &s;o happy in this re&s;pect, as Virgil and Ta&s;&s;o.</P>
<P>MUCH, too, depends on the characters of the Heroes, for rendering the Poem intere&s;t|ing; that they be &s;uch, as &s;hall &s;trongly at|tach the Readers, and make them take part in the dangers which the Heroes encounter. The&s;e dangers, or ob&s;tacles, form what is called the Nodus, or the intrigue of the Epic Poem; in the judicious conduct of which, con&s;i&s;ts much of the Poet's art. He mu&s;t rou&s;e our attention, by a pro&s;pect of the dif|ficulties which &s;eem to threaten di&s;appointment to the enterprize of his favourite per&s;onages; he mu&s;t make the&s;e difficulties grow and thicken upon us by degrees; till, after having kept us, for &s;ome time, in a &s;tate of agitati|on and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he paves the way, by a pro|per preparation of incidents, for the winding up of the plot in a natural and probable manner. It is plain, that every tale which is de&s;igned to engage attention, mu&s;t be con|ducted on a plan of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>A QUESTION has been moved, whether the nature of the Epic Poem does not require that it &s;hould always end &s;ucce&s;sfully? Mo&s;t Critics incline to think, that a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue is the mo&s;t proper; and they appear to have rea&s;on on their &s;ide. An unhappy conclu|&s;ion depre&s;&s;es the mind, and is oppo&s;ite to the elevating emotions which belong to this &s;pecies of Poetry. Terror and compa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="232" REF="235">
are the proper &s;ubjects of tragedy; but as the Epic Poem is of larger compa&s;s and ex|tent, it were too much, if, after the difficul|ties and troubles which commonly abound in the progre&s;s of the Poem, the Author &s;hould bring them all at la&s;t to an unfortunate i&s;&s;ue. Accordingly, the general practice of Epic Poets is on the &s;ide of a pro&s;perous conclu|&s;ion; not, however, without &s;ome excepti|ons. For two Authors of great name, Lucan and Milton, have held a contrary cour&s;e; the one concluding with the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Roman Liberty; the other, with the expul|&s;ion of man from paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the time or duration of the Epic action, no preci&s;e boundaries can be a&s;certained. A con&s;iderable extent is always allowed to it, as it does not nece&s;&s;arily de|pend on tho&s;e violent pa&s;&s;ions which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have only a &s;hort continuance. The Iliad, which is formed upon the anger of Achilles, has, with propriety, the &s;horte&s;t duration of any of the great Epic Poems. Ac|cording to Bo&s;&s;u, the action la&s;ts no longer than forty-&s;even days. The action of the Ody&s;&s;ey, computed from the taking of Troy to the peace of Ithaca, extends to eight years and a half; and the action of the Aeneid, computed in the &s;ame way, from the taking of Troy to the death of Turnus, includes about &s;ix years. But if we mea&s;ure the pe|riod only of the Poet's own narration, or compute from the time in which the Hero
<PB N="233" REF="236">
makes his fir&s;t appearance, till the conclu&s;i|on, the duration of both the&s;e la&s;t Poems is brought within a much &s;maller compa&s;s. The Ody&s;&s;ey beginning with Uly&s;&s;es in the i&s;land of Calyp&s;o, comprehends fifty-eight days only; and the Aeneid, beginning with the &s;torm, which throws Aeneas upon the coa&s;t of Africa, is reckoned to include, at the mo&s;t, a year and &s;ome months.</P>
<P>HAVING thus treated of the Epic Action, or the &s;ubject of the Poem, I proceed next to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the Actors or Per&s;onages.</P>
<P>As it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an Epic Poet to copy after nature, and to form a probable in|tere&s;ting tale, he mu&s;t &s;tudy to give all his Per&s;onages proper and well-&s;upported cha|racters, &s;uch as di&s;play the features of human nature. This is what Ari&s;totle calls, giving manners to the Poem. It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, that all his actors be morally good; imperfect, nay, vicious characters may find a proper place; though the nature of Epic Poetry &s;eems to require, that the principal figures exhibited &s;hould be &s;uch as to tend to rai&s;e admiration and love, rather than hatred or contempt. But whatever the character be which a Poet gives to any of his actors, he mu&s;t take care to pre&s;erve it uniform, and con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. Every thing which that per&s;on &s;ays, or does, mu&s;t be &s;uited to
<PB N="234" REF="237">
it, and mu&s;t &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h him from any other.</P>
<P>POETIC characters may be divided into two kinds, general and particular. General characters are, &s;uch as wi&s;e, brave, virtuous, without any farther di&s;tinction. Particular characters expre&s;s the &s;pecies of bravery, of wi&s;dom, of virtue, for which any one is emi|nent. They exhibit the peculiar features which di&s;tingui&s;h one individual from ano|ther, which mark the difference of the &s;ame moral quality in different men, according as it is combined with other di&s;po&s;itions in their temper. In drawing &s;uch particular charac|ters, genius is chiefly exerted. How far each of the three great Epic Poets have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in this part of Compo&s;i|tion, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion afterwards to &s;how, when I come to make remarks upon their works. It is &s;ufficient now to mention, that it is in this part Homer has principally excell|ed; Ta&s;&s;o has come the neare&s;t to Homer; and Virgil has been the mo&s;t deficient.</P>
<P>IT has been the practice of all Epic Poets, to &s;elect &s;ome one per&s;onage, whom they di&s;|tingui&s;h above all the re&s;t, and make the hero of the tale. This is con&s;idered as e&s;&s;en|tial to Epic Compo&s;ition, and is attended with &s;everal advantages. It renders the uni|ty of the &s;ubject more &s;en&s;ible, when there is one principal figure, to which, as to a centre, all the re&s;t refer. It tends to intere&s;t us more
<PB N="235" REF="238">
in the enterprize which is carried on; and it gives the Poet an opportunity of exerting his talents for adorning, and di&s;playing one cha|racter, with peculiar &s;plendor. It has been a&s;ked, Who then is the hero of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t? The Devil, it has been an&s;wered by &s;ome Critics; and, in con&s;equence of this idea, much ridicule and cen&s;ure has been thrown upon Milton. But they have mi&s;|taken that Author's intention, by proceeding upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in the conclu&s;ion of the Poem, the hero mu&s;t needs be trium|phant. Whereas Milton followed a different plan, and has given a tragic conclu&s;ion to a Poem, otherwi&s;e Epic in its form. For Adam is undoubtedly his hero; that is, the capital and mo&s;t intere&s;ting figure in his Poem.</P>
<P>BESIDES human actors, there are per&s;o|nages of another kind, that u&s;ually occupy no &s;mall place in Epic Poetry, I mean the gods, or &s;upernatural beings. This brings us to the con&s;ideration of what is called the Machine|ry of the Epic Poem; the mo&s;t nice and dif|ficult part of the &s;ubject. Critics appear to me to have gone to extremes, on both &s;ides. Almo&s;t all the French Critics decide in favour of Machinery, as e&s;&s;ential to the con&s;titution of an Epic Poem. They quote that &s;entence of Petronius Arbiter, as if it were an oracle, <Q REND="inline">"per ambages, Deorumque mini&s;teria, pre|cipitandus e&s;t liber &s;piritus,"</Q> and hold, that though a Poem had every other requi&s;ite that
<PB N="236" REF="239">
could be demanded, yet it could not be rank|ed in the Epic cla&s;s, unle&s;s the main action was carried on by the intervention of the gods. This deci&s;ion &s;eems to be founded on no principle or rea&s;on whatever, unle&s;s a &s;u|per&s;titious reverence for the practice of Ho|mer and Virgil. The&s;e Poets very properly embelli&s;hed their &s;tory by the traditional tales and popular legends of their own country; according to which, all the great tran&s;actions of the heroic times were intermixed with the fables of their deities. But does it thence follow, that in other countries, and other ages, where there is not the like advantage of current &s;uper&s;tition, and popular creduli|ty, Epic Poetry mu&s;t be wholly confined to antiquated fictions, and fairy tales? Lucan has compo&s;ed a very &s;pirited Poem, certainly of the Epic kind, where neither gods nor &s;u|pernatural beings are at all employed. The Author of Leonidas has made an attempt of the &s;ame kind, not without &s;ucce&s;s; and be|yond doubt, wherever a Poet gives us a re|gular heroic &s;tory, well connected in its parts, adorned with characters, and &s;upported with proper dignity and elevation, though his agents be every one of them human, he has fulfilled the chief requi&s;ites of this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition, and has a ju&s;t title to be cla&s;&s;ed with Epic Writers.</P>
<P>BUT though I cannot admit that Machi|nery is nece&s;&s;ary or e&s;&s;ential to the Epic plan, neither can I agree with &s;ome late Critics of

<PB N="237" REF="240">
con&s;iderable name, who are for excluding it totally, as incon&s;i&s;tent with that probability and impre&s;&s;ion of reality, which, they think, &s;hould reign in this kind of Writing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Elm. of Critici&s;m, ch. 22.</NOTE>. Mankind do not con&s;ider Poetical Writings with &s;o philo&s;ophical an eye. They &s;eek en|tertainment from them; and for the bulk of Readers, indeed for almo&s;t all men, the mar|vellous has a great charm. It gratifies and fills the imagination; and gives room for many a &s;triking and &s;ublime de&s;cription. In Epic Poetry, in particular, where admiration and lofty ideas are &s;uppo&s;ed to reign, the marvel|lous and &s;upernatural find, if any where, their proper place. They both enable the Poet to aggrandize his &s;ubject, by means of tho&s;e augu&s;t and &s;olemn objects which Reli|gion introduces into it; and they allow him to enlarge and diver&s;ify his plan, by com|prehending within it heaven, and earth, and hell, men and invi&s;ible beings, and the whole circle of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, in the u&s;e of this &s;u|pernatural Machinery, it becomes a Poet to be temperate and prudent. He is not at li|berty to invent what &s;y&s;tem of the marvel|lous he plea&s;es. It mu&s;t always have &s;ome foundation in popular belief. He mu&s;t avail him&s;elf in a decent manner, either of the religious faith, or the &s;uper&s;titious credulity of the country wherein he lives, or of which
<PB N="238" REF="241">
he writes, &s;o as to give an air of probability to events which are mo&s;t contrary to the common cour&s;e of nature. Whatever Machinery he employs, he mu&s;t take care not to over|load us with it; not to withdraw human actions and manners too much from view, nor to ob&s;cure them under a cloud of incre|dible fictions. He mu&s;t always remember, that his chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to relate to men, the actions and exploits of men; that it is, by the&s;e principally he is to intere&s;t us, and to touch our hearts; and that if probability be altogether bani&s;hed from his work, it can never make a deep or a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion. Indeed, I know nothing more difficult in Epic Poetry, than to adju&s;t properly the mix|ture of the marvellous with the probable; &s;o as to gratify and amu&s;e us with the one, without &s;acrificing the other. I need hardly ob&s;erve, that the&s;e ob&s;ervations affect not the conduct of Milton's work; who&s;e plan being altogether theological, his &s;upernatural beings form not the machinery, but are the princi|pal actors in the Poem.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Allegorical Per&s;onages, Fame, Di&s;cord, Love, and the like, it may be &s;afely pronounced, that they form the wor&s;t machinery of any. In de&s;cription they are &s;ometimes allowable, and may &s;erve for embelli&s;hment; but they &s;hould never be permitted to bear any &s;hare in the action of the Poem. For being plain and declared fictions, mere names of general ideas, to
<PB N="239" REF="242">
which even fancy cannot attribute any ex|i&s;tence as per&s;ons, if they are introduced as mingling with human actors, an intolerable confu&s;ion of &s;hadows and realities ari&s;es, and all con&s;i&s;tency of action is utterly de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>IN the narration of the Poet, which is the la&s;t head that remains to be con&s;idered, it is not material, whether he relate the whole &s;tory in his own character, or introduce &s;ome of his per&s;onages to relate any part of the action that had pa&s;&s;ed before the Poem opens. Homer follows the one method in his Iliad, and the other in his Ody&s;&s;ey. Virgil has, in this re&s;pect, imitated the conduct of the Ody&s;&s;ey; Ta&s;&s;o that of the Iliad. The chief advantage which ari&s;es from any of the Actors being employed to relate part of the &s;tory, is, that it allows the Poet, if he choo&s;es it, to open with &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;ituation of affairs, informing us afterwards of what had pa&s;&s;ed before that period; and gives him the greater liberty of &s;preading out &s;uch parts of the &s;ubject as he inclines to dwell upon in per&s;on, and of comprehending the re&s;t within a &s;hort recital. Where the &s;ubject is of great extent, and comprehends the tran&s;actions of &s;everal years, as in the Ody&s;&s;ey and the Aeneid, this method therefore &s;eems prefera|ble. When the &s;ubject is of a &s;maller com|pa&s;s, and &s;horter duration, as in the Iliad and the Jeru&s;alem, the Poet may, without di&s;advantage, relate the whole in his own
<PB N="240" REF="243">
per&s;on, according as is done in both the&s;e Poems.</P>
<P>IN the propo&s;ition of the &s;ubject, the in|vocation of the Mu&s;e, and other ceremonies of the introduction, Poets may vary at their plea&s;ure. It is perfectly trifling to make the&s;e little formalities the object of preci&s;e rule, any farther, than that the &s;ubject of the work &s;hould always be clearly propo&s;ed, and without affected or un&s;uitable pomp. For, according to Horace's noted rule, no Introduction &s;hould ever &s;et out too high, or promi&s;e too much, le&s;t the Author &s;hould not fulfil the expectations he has rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHAT is of mo&s;t importance in the tenor of the narration is, that it be per&s;picuous, animated, and enriched with all the beauties of Poetry. No &s;ort of Compo&s;ition requires more &s;trength, dignity, and fire, than the Epic Poem. It is the region within which we look for every thing that is &s;ublime in de&s;cription, tender in &s;entiment, and bold and lively in expre&s;&s;ion; and therefore, though an Author's plan &s;hould be faultle&s;s, and his &s;tory ever &s;o well conducted, yet if he be feeble, or Flat in Style, de&s;titute of affecting &s;cenes, and deficient in poetical colouring, he can have no &s;ucce&s;s. The ornaments which Epic Poetry admits, mu&s;t all be of the grave and cha&s;te kind. Nothing that is loo&s;e, lu|dicrous, or affected, finds any place there.
<PB N="241" REF="244">
All the objects which it pre&s;ents ought to be either great, or tender, or plea&s;ing. De&s;crip|tions of di&s;gu&s;ting or &s;hocking objects, &s;hould as much as po&s;&s;ible be avoided; and there|fore the fable of the Harpies, in the third book of the Aeneid, and the allegory of Sin and Death, in the &s;econd book of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, had been better omitted in the&s;e cele|brated Poems.</P>

<P>AS the Epic Poem is univer&s;ally allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t rank among Poe|tical Works, it merits a particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Having treated of the nature of this Compo|&s;ition, and the principal rules relating to it, I proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Epic Poems. Ancient and Modern.</P>
<P>HOMER claims, on every account, our fir&s;t attention, as the father not only of Epic, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of Poetry in general. Whoever &s;its down to read Homer, mu&s;t con&s;ider that he is going to read the mo&s;t an|cient book in the World, next to the Bible. Without making this reflection, he cannot enter into the &s;pirit, nor reli&s;h the Compo&s;i|tion
<PB N="243" REF="246">
of the Author. He is not to look for the correctne&s;s, and elegance, of the Augu&s;|tan Age. He mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of our modern ideas of dignity and refinement; and tran&s;port his imagination almo&s;t three thou|&s;and years back in the hi&s;tory of mankind. What he is to expect, is a picture of the an|cient world. He mu&s;t reckon upon finding characters and manners, that retain a con&s;i|derable tincture of the &s;avage &s;tate; moral ideas, as yet imperfectly formed; and the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions of men brought under none of tho&s;e re&s;traints, to which, in a more advanced State of Society, they are accu&s;|tomed. But bodily &s;trength, prized as one of the chief heroic endowments; the prepar|ing of a meal, and the appea&s;ing of hunger, de&s;cribed as very intere&s;ting objects; and the heroes boa&s;ting of them&s;elves openly, &s;cold|ing one another outrageou&s;ly, and glorying, as we would now think very indecently, over their fallen enemies.</P>
<P>THE opening of the Iliad, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es none of that &s;ort of dignity, which a modern looks for in a great Epic Poem. It turns on no higher &s;ubject, than the quarrel of two Chief|tans about a female &s;lave. The prie&s;t of Apollo be&s;eeches Agamemnon to re&s;tore his daughter, who, in the plunder of a city, had fallen to Agamemnon's &s;hare of booty. He refu&s;es. Apollo, at the prayer of his Prie&s;t, &s;ends a plague into the Grecian camp. The Augur, when con&s;ulted, declares, that there
<PB N="244" REF="247">
is no way of appea&s;ing Apollo, but by re|&s;toring the daughter of his Prie&s;t. Agamem|non is enraged at the Augur; profe&s;&s;es that he likes his &s;lave better than his wife Cly|temne&s;tra; but &s;ince he mu&s;t re&s;tore her in order to &s;ave the army, in&s;i&s;ts to have ano|ther in her place; and pitches upon Bri&s;eis, the &s;lave of Achilles. Achilles, as was to be expected, kindles into rage at this de|mand; reproaches him for his rapacity and in&s;olence, and, after giving him many hard names, &s;olemnly &s;wears, that, if he is to be thus treated by the General, he will with|draw his troops, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Grecians no more again&s;t the Trojans. He withdraws accordingly. His Mother, the Godde&s;s The|tis, intere&s;ts Jupiter in his cau&s;e; who, to revenge the wrong which Achilles had &s;uf|fered, takes part again&s;t the Greeks, and &s;uffers them to fall into great and long di&s;tre&s;s; until Achilles is pacified, and reconciliation brought about between him and Agamemnon.</P>
<P>SUCH is the ba&s;is of the whole action of the Iliad. Hence ri&s;e all tho&s;e <Q REND="inline">"&s;pecio&s;a miracula,"</Q> as Horace terms them, which fill that extraordinary Poem; and which have had the power of intere&s;ting almo&s;t all the nations of Europe, during every age, &s;ince the days of Homer. The general ad|miration commanded by a Poetical plan, &s;o very different from what any one would have formed in our times, ought not, upon reflec|tion, to be matter of &s;urpri&s;e. For, be&s;ides
<PB N="245" REF="248">
that a fertile genius can enrich and beautify any &s;ubject on which it is employed, it is to be ob&s;erved, that ancient manners, how much &s;oever they contradict our pre&s;ent notions of dignity and refinement, afford, neverthele&s;s, materials for Poetry, &s;uperior, in &s;ome re|&s;pects, to tho&s;e which are furni&s;hed by a more poli&s;hed &s;tate of Society. They di&s;co|ver human nature more open and undi&s;gui&s;ed, without any of tho&s;e &s;tudied forms of beha|viour which now conceal men from one ano|ther. They give free &s;cope to the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t impetuous emotions of the mind, which make a better figure in de&s;cription, than calm and temperate feelings. They &s;how us our native prejudices, appetites, and de&s;ires, exerting them&s;elves without controul. From this &s;tate of manners, joined with the advantages of that &s;trong and expre&s;&s;ive Style, which, as I formerly ob&s;erved, com|monly di&s;tingui&s;hes the Compo&s;itions of early ages, we have ground to look for more of the boldne&s;s, ea&s;e and freedom of native genius, in compo&s;itions of &s;uch a period, than in tho&s;e of more civilized times. And, accordingly, the two great characters of the Homeric Poetry are, Fire and Simplicity. Let us now proceed to make &s;ome more par|ticular ob&s;ervations on the Iliad, under the three heads of the &s;ubject and Action, the Characters, and Narration of the Poet.</P>
<P>THE Subject of the Iliad mu&s;t unque&s;|tionably be admitted to be, in the main, hap|pily
<PB N="246" REF="249">
cho&s;en. In the days of Homer, no ob|ject could be more &s;plendid and dignified than the Trojan war. So great a confederacy of the Grecian States, under one leader; and the ten years &s;iege which they carried on again&s;t Troy, mu&s;t have &s;pread far abroad the renown of many military exploits, and intere&s;ted all Greece in the traditions con|cerning the Heroes who had mo&s;t eminently &s;ignalized them&s;elves. Upon the&s;e traditi|ons, Homer grounded his Poem; and though he lived, as is generally believed, only two or three centuries after the Trojan war, yet, through the want of written records, tradi|tion mu&s;t, by this time, have fallen into the degree of ob&s;curity mo&s;t proper for Poetry; and have left him at full liberty to mix as much fable as he plea&s;ed, with the remains of true hi&s;tory. He has not cho&s;en, for his &s;ubject, the whole Trojan war; but, with great judgment, he has &s;elected one part of it, the quarrel betwixt Achilles and Agamem|non, and the events to which that quarrel gave ri&s;e; which, though they take up forty|&s;even days only, yet include the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting, and mo&s;t critical period of the war. By this management, he has given greater unity to what would have otherwi&s;e been an unconnected hi&s;tory of battles. He has gained one Hero, or principal character, Achilles, who reigns throughout the work; and he has &s;hown the pernicious effect of di&s;cord among confederated princes. At the &s;ame time, I admit that Homer is le&s;s fortunate in his
<PB N="247" REF="250">
&s;ubject than Virgil. The plan of the Aeneid includes a greater compa&s;s, and a more agree|able diver&s;ity of events; whereas the Iliad is almo&s;t entirely filled with battles.</P>
<P>THE prai&s;e of high invention has in every age been given to Homer, with the greate&s;t rea&s;on. The prodigious number of incidents, of &s;peeches, of characters divine and human, with which he abounds; the &s;urpri&s;ing vari|ety with which he has diver&s;ified his battles, in the wounds and deaths, and little hi&s;tory pieces of almo&s;t all the per&s;ons &s;lain, di&s;cover an invention next to boundle&s;s. But the prai&s;e of judgment is, in my opinion, no le&s;s due to Homer, than that of invention. His &s;tory is all along conducted with great art. He ri&s;es upon us gradually; his Heroes are brought out, one after another, to be objects of our attention. The di&s;tre&s;s thickens, as the Poem advances; and every thing is &s;o contrived as to aggrandize Achilles, and to render him, as the Poet intended he &s;hould be, the capital figure.</P>
<P>BUT that wherein Homer excels all Wri|ters, is the characteri&s;tical part. Here, he is without a rival. His lively and &s;pirited exhibition of characters, is, in a great mea|&s;ure, owing to his being &s;o dramatic a Wri|ter, abounding every where with dialogue and conver&s;ation. There is much more dialogue in Homer than in Virgil; or, indeed, than in any other Poet. What Virgil informs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of by two words of Narration, Homer bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="248" REF="251">
about by a Speech. We may ob&s;erve here, that this method of Writing is more ancient than the narrative manner. Of this we have a clear proof in the Books of the Old Te&s;|tament, which, in&s;tead of Narration, abound with &s;peeches, with an&s;wers and replies, upon the mo&s;t familiar &s;ubjects. Thus, in the Book of Gene&s;is: <Q REND="inline">"Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto his brethren, whence come ye? and they an|&s;wered, From the land of Canaan we come to buy food. And Jo&s;eph &s;aid, Ye are &s;pies; to &s;ee the nakedne&s;s of the land are ye come. And they &s;aid unto him, Nay, my Lord, but to buy food are thy &s;ervants come; we are all one man's &s;ons, we are true men, thy &s;ervants are no &s;pies. And he &s;aid unto them, Nay, but to &s;ee the nakedne&s;s of the land ye are come. And they &s;aid, Thy &s;ervants are twelve brethren, the &s;ons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold the younge&s;t is this day with our father; and one is not. And Jo&s;eph &s;aid unto them, this it is that I &s;pake unto you, &s;aying ye are &s;pies. Here|by ye &s;hall be proved; by the life of Pha|roah, ye &s;hall not go forth, except your younge&s;t brother come hither, &amp;c." <BIBL>Gene|&s;is xlii. 7-15.</BIBL></Q> Such a Style as this, is the mo&s;t &s;imple and artle&s;s form of Writing; and mu&s;t, therefore, undoubtedly have been the mo&s;t ancient. It is copying directly from nature; giving a plain rehear&s;al of what pa&s;&s;ed, or was &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s, in conver|&s;ation between the per&s;ons of whom the Au|thor
<PB N="249" REF="252">
treats. In progre&s;s of time, when the Art of Writing was more &s;tudied, it was thought more elegant to compre&s;s the &s;ub|&s;tance of conver&s;ation into &s;hort di&s;tinct nar|rative, made by the Poet or Hi&s;torian in his own per&s;on; and to re&s;erve direct &s;peeches for &s;olemn occa&s;ions only.</P>
<P>THE Ancient Dramatic method which Homer practi&s;ed, has &s;ome advantages, ba|lanced with &s;ome defects. It renders Com|po&s;ition more natural and animated, and more expre&s;&s;ive of manners and characters; but withal le&s;s grave and maje&s;tic, and &s;ome|times tire&s;ome. Homer, it mu&s;t be admitted, has carried his propen&s;ity to the making of Speeches too far; and if he be tedious any where, it is in the&s;e; &s;ome of them trifling, and &s;ome of them plainly un&s;ea&s;onable. Together with the Greek vivacity, he leaves upon our minds, &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion of the Greek loquacity al&s;o. His Speeches, how|ever, are upon the whole characteri&s;tic and lively; and to them we owe, in a great mea&s;ure, that admirable di&s;play which he has given of human nature. Every one who reads him, becomes familiarly and intimately acquainted with his heroes. We &s;eem to have lived among them, and to have conver|&s;ed with them. Not only has he pur&s;ued the &s;ingle virtue of courage, through all its dif|ferent forms and features, in his different warriors; but &s;ome more delicate characters, into which courage either enters not at all,
<PB N="250" REF="253">
or but for an incon&s;iderable part, he has drawn with &s;ingular art.</P>
<P>HOW finely, for in&s;tance, has he painted the character of Helen, &s;o as, notwith&s;tand|ing her frailty and her crimes, to prevent her from being an odious object! The admiration with which the old generals behold her, in the Third Book, when &s;he is coming towards them, pre&s;ents her to us with much dignity. Her veiling her&s;elf and &s;hedding tears, her confu&s;ion in the pre&s;ence of Priam, her grief and &s;elf-accu&s;ations at the &s;ight of Menelaus, her upbraiding of Paris for his cowardice, and, at the &s;ame time, her returning fond|ne&s;s for him, exhibit the mo&s;t &s;triking fea|tures of that mixed female character, which we partly condemn, and partly pity. Homer never introduces her, without making her &s;ay &s;omething to move our compa&s;&s;ion; while, at the &s;ame time, he takes care to contra&s;t her character with that of a virtuous matron, in the cha&s;te and tender Andro|mache.</P>
<P>PARIS him&s;elf, the Author of all the mi&s;|chief, is characteri&s;ed with the utmo&s;t pro|priety. He is, as we would expect him, a mixture of gallantry and effeminacy. He retreats from Menelaus, on his fir&s;t appear|ance; but immediately afterwards, enters into &s;ingle combat with him. He is a great ma&s;ter of civility, remarkably courteous in his &s;peeches; and receives all the reproofs of
<PB N="251" REF="254">
his brother Hector with mode&s;ty and defer|ence. He is de&s;cribed as a per&s;on of ele|gance and ta&s;te. He was the Architect of his own Palace. He is, in the Sixth Book, found by Hector, burni&s;hing and dre&s;&s;ing up his armour; and i&s;&s;ues forth to battle with a peculiar gaiety and o&s;tentation of appearance, which is illu&s;trated by one of the fine&s;t com|pari&s;ons in all the Iliad, that of the hor&s;e prancing to the river.</P>
<P>HOMER has been blamed for making his hero Achilles of too brutal and inamiable a character. But I am inclined to think, that inju&s;tice is commonly done to Achilles, upon the credit of two lines of Horace, who has certainly overloaded his character.<Q><L>Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,</L>
<L>Jura negat &s;ibi nata; nihil non arrogat armis.</L></Q></P>
<P>ACHILLES is pa&s;&s;ionate indeed, to a great degree; but he is far from being a contemner of laws and ju&s;tice. In the conte&s;t with Agamemnon, though he carries it on with too much heat, yet he has rea&s;on on his &s;ide. He was notoriou&s;ly wronged; but he &s;ub|mits; and re&s;igns Bri&s;eis peaceably, when the heralds come to demand her; only, he will fight no longer under the command of a leader who had affronted him. Be&s;ides his wonderful bravery and contempt of death, he has &s;everal other qualities of a Hero. He is open and &s;incere. He loves his &s;ubjects,

and re&s;pects the Gods. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;trong friend&s;hips and attachments; he is, throughout, high &s;pirited, gallant, and ho|nourable; and allowing for a degree of fero|city which belonged to the times, and enters into the characters of mo&s;t of Homer's He|roes, he is, upon the whole, abundantly fitted to rai&s;e high admiration, though not pure e&s;teem.</P>
<P>UNDER the head of Characters, Homer's Gods or his Machinery, according to the cri|tical term, come under con&s;ideration. The Gods make a great figure in the Iliad; much greater indeed than they do in the Aeneid, or in any other Epic Poem; and hence Homer has become the &s;tandard of Poetic Theology. Concerning Machinery in general, I deliver|ed my &s;entiments in the former Lecture. Concerning Homer's Machinery, in particu|lar, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it was not his own invention. Like every other good Poet, he unque&s;tionably followed the traditions of his country. The age of the Trojan war ap|proached to the age of the Gods, and Demi|gods, in Greece. Several of the Heroes con|cerned in that war, were reputed to be the children of tho&s;e Gods. Of cour&s;e, the tra|ditionary tales relating to them, and to the exploits of that age, were blended with the Fables of the Deities. The&s;e popular le|gends, Homer very properly adopted; though it is perfectly ab&s;urd to infer from this, that therefore Poets ari&s;ing in &s;ucceeding ages,
<PB N="253" REF="256">
and writing on quite different &s;ubjects, are obliged to follow the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of Machi|nery.</P>
<P>IN the hands of Homer, it produces, on the whole, a noble effect; it is always gay and amu&s;ing; often, lofty and magnificent. It introduces into his Poem a great number of per&s;onages, almo&s;t as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by characters as his human actors. It diver|&s;ifies his battles greatly, by the intervention of the Gods; and by frequently &s;hifting the &s;cene from earth to heaven, it gives an agree|able relief to the mind, in the mid&s;t of &s;o much blood and &s;laughter. Homer's Gods, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, though they be always lively and animated figures, yet &s;ometimes want dignity. The conjugal contentions between Juno and Jupiter, with which he entertains us, and the indecent &s;quabbles he de&s;cribes among the inferior Deities, accord|ing as they take different &s;ides with the con|tending parties, would be very unlucky mo|dels for any modern Poet to imitate. In apology for Homer, however, it mu&s;t be re|membered, that according to the Fables of tho&s;e days, the Gods are but one remove above the condition of men. They have all the human pa&s;&s;ions. They drink and fea&s;t, and are vulnerable like men; they have chil|dren, and kin&s;men, in the oppo&s;ite armies; and bating that they are immortal, that they have hou&s;es on the top of Olympus, and winged chariots, in which they are often fly|ing down to earth, and then re-a&s;cending, in
<PB N="254" REF="257">
order to fea&s;t on Nectar and Ambro&s;ia; they are in truth no higher beings than the hu|man Heroes, and therefore very fit to take part in their contentions. At the &s;ame time, though Homer &s;o frequently degrades his di|vinities, yet he knows how to make them appear in &s;ome conjunctures, with the mo&s;t awful Maje&s;ty. Jupiter, the Father of Gods and Men, is, for the mo&s;t part, introduced with great dignity; and &s;everal of the mo&s;t &s;ublime conceptions in the Iliad, are founded on the appearances of Neptune, Minerva, and Apollo, on great occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Homer's Style and man|ner of Writing, it is ea&s;y, natural, and, in the highe&s;t degree, animated. It will be ad|mired by &s;uch only as reli&s;h ancient &s;impli|city, and can make allowance for certain ne|gligencies and repetitions, which greater re|finement in the Art of Writing has taught &s;ucceeding, though far inferior, Poets to avoid. For Homer is the mo&s;t &s;imple in his Style of all the great Poets, and re&s;embles mo&s;t the Style of the poetical parts of the Old Te&s;tament. They can have no concep|tion of his manner, who are acquainted with him in Mr. Pope's Tran&s;lation only. An excellent poetical performance that Tran&s;la|tion is, and faithful in the main to the Ori|ginal. In &s;ome places, it may be thought to have even improved Homer. It has cer|tainly &s;oftened &s;ome of his rudene&s;&s;es, and added delicacy and grace to &s;ome of his &s;en|timents.
<PB N="255" REF="258">
But withal, it is no other than Homer moderni&s;ed. In the mid&s;t of the ele|gance and luxuriancy of Mr. Pope's language, we lo&s;e &s;ight of the old Bard's &s;implicity. I know indeed no Author, to whom it is more difficult to do ju&s;tice in a Tran&s;lation, than Homer. As the plainne&s;s of his diction, were it literally rendered, would often appear flat in any modern language; &s;o, in the mid&s;t of that plainne&s;s, and not a little heightened by it, there are every where breaking forth upon us fla&s;hes of native fire, of &s;ublimity and beauty, which hardly any language, ex|cept his own, could pre&s;erve. His Ver&s;ifica|tion has been univer&s;ally acknowledged to be uncommonly melodious; and to carry, be|yond that of any Poet, a re&s;emblance in the &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e and meaning.</P>
<P>IN Narration, Homer is, at all times, re|markably conci&s;e, which renders him lively and agreeable; though in his &s;peeches, as I have before admitted, &s;ometimes tedious. He is every where de&s;criptive; and de&s;criptive by means of tho&s;e well cho&s;en particulars, which form the excellency of de&s;cription. Virgil gives us the nod of Jupiter with great magni|ficence.<Q><L>Annuit; et totum nutu tremefecit Olympum.</L></Q></P>
<P>BUT Homer, in de&s;cribing the &s;ame thing, gives us the &s;able eye-brows of Jupiter bent, and his ambro&s;ial curls &s;haken, at the mo|ment when he gives the nod; and thereby
<PB N="256" REF="259">
renders the figure more natural and lively. Whenever he &s;eeks to draw our attention to &s;ome intere&s;ting object, he particulari&s;es it &s;o happily, as to paint it in a manner to our &s;ight. The &s;hot of Pandarus' arrow, which broke the truce between the two armies, as related in the Fourth Book, may be given for an in&s;tance; and above all, the admirable inter|view of Hector with Andromache, in the Sixth Book; where all the circum&s;tances of conjugal and parental tenderne&s;s, the child affrighted with the view of his Father's Hel|met and Chre&s;t, and clinging to the nur&s;e; Hector putting off his Helmet, taking the child into his arms, and offering up a prayer for him to the Gods; Andromache receiving back the child with a &s;mile of plea&s;ure, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, bur&s;ting into tears, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, as it is finely expre&s;&s;ed in the original, form the mo&s;t natural and affecting picture that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined.</P>
<P>IN the de&s;cription of Battles, Homer par|ticularly excels. He works up the hurry, the terror, and confu&s;ion of them in &s;o ma&s;|terly a manner, as to place the Reader in the very mid&s;t of the engagement. It is here, that the fire of his genius is mo&s;t highly di&s;|played; in&s;omuch, that Virgil's Battles, and indeed tho&s;e of mo&s;t other Poets, are cold and inanimated in compari&s;on of Homer's.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Similies, no Poet abounds &s;o much with them. Several of them are
<PB N="257" REF="260">
beyond doubt extremely beautiful: &s;uch as tho&s;e, of the fires in the Trojan camp com|pared to the Moon and Stars by night; Paris going &s;orth to Battle, to the war-hor&s;e pran|cing to the river; and Euphorbus &s;lain, to the flowering &s;hrub cut down by a &s;udden bla&s;t: all which are among the fine&s;t poetical pa&s;&s;ages that are any where to be found. I am not, however, of opinion, that Homer's Compari&s;ons, taken in general, are his great|e&s;t beauties. They come too thick upon us; and often interrupt the train of his narration or de&s;cription. The re&s;emblance on which they are founded, is &s;ometimes not clear; and the objects whence they are taken, are too uniform. His Lions, Bulls, Eagles, and herds of &s;heep, recur too frequently; and the allu&s;ions in &s;ome of his Similies, even after the allowances that are to be made for ancient manners, mu&s;t be admitted to be deba&s;ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The &s;evere&s;t critic upon Homer in modern times, M. la Motte, admits all that his admirers urge for the &s;uperio|rity of his genius and talents as a Poet: <Q REND="inline">"C'&eacute;toit un g&eacute;|nie naturellement Po&euml;tique, ami des Fables &amp; des merveil|leux, et port&eacute; en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave; l'imitation, &s;oit des objets de la nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oit des &s;entimens et des actions des hommes.

But his principal objec|tions turn on the deba&s;ing ideas which are there given of the Gods, the gro&s;s characters and manners of the Heroes, and the imperfect morality of the &s;entiments: which, as Voltaire ob&s;erves, is like accu&s;ing a painter for having drawn his figures in the dre&s;s of the times. Homer painted his Gods, &s;uch as popular tradition then repre&s;ented them; and de&s;cribed &s;uch characters and &s;entiments, as he found among tho&s;e with whom he lived.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="261">
MY ob&s;ervations, hitherto, have been made upon the Iliad only. It is nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of the Ody&s;&s;ey al&s;o. Lon|ginus's critici&s;m upon it is not without foun|dation, that Homer may in this Poem be compared to the &s;etting &s;un, who&s;e gran|deur &s;till remains, without the heat of his meridian beams. It wants the vigour and fublimity of the Iliad; yet, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many beauties, as to be ju&s;tly en|titled to high prai&s;e. It is a very amu&s;ing Poem, and has much greater variety than the Iliad; it contains many intere&s;ting &s;tories, and beautiful de&s;criptions. We &s;ee every where the &s;ame de&s;criptive and dramatic ge|nius, and the &s;ame fertility of invention that appears in the other work. It de&s;cends in|deed from the dignity of Gods, and Heroes, and warlike atchievements; but in recom|pence, we have more plea&s;ing pictures of an|cient manners. In&s;tead of that ferocity which reigns in the Iliad, the Ody&s;&s;ey pre&s;ents us
<PB N="259" REF="262">
with the mo&s;t amiable images of ho&s;pitality and humanity; entertains us with many a wonderful adventure, and many a land&s;cape of nature; and in&s;tructs us by a con&s;tant vein of morality and virtue, which runs through the Poem.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, there are &s;ome defects which mu&s;t be acknowledged in the Ody&s;&s;ey. Many &s;cenes in it, fall below the Maje&s;ty which we naturally expect in an Epic Poem. The la&s;t Twelve Books, after Uly&s;&s;es is landed in Ithaca, are, in &s;everal parts, tedi|ous and languid; and though the di&s;covery which Uly&s;&s;es makes of him&s;elf to his Nur&s;e, Euryclea, and his interview with Penelope before &s;he knows him, in the Nineteenth Book, are tender and affecting, yet the Poet does not &s;eem happy in the great anagnori&s;is, or the di&s;covery of Uly&s;&s;es to Penelope. She is too cautious and di&s;tru&s;tful, and we are di&s;appointed of the &s;urpri&s;e of joy, which we expected on that high occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AFTER having &s;aid &s;o much of the Father of Epic Poetry, it is now time to proceed to Virgil, who has a very marked character, quite di&s;tinct from that of Homer. As the di&s;tingui&s;hing excellencies of the Iliad are, Simplicity and Fire; tho&s;e of the Aeneid are, Elegance and Tenderne&s;s. Virgil is, beyond doubt, le&s;s animated and le&s;s &s;ublime than Homer; but to counterbalance this, he has fewer negligencies, greater variety, and &s;up|ports
<PB N="260" REF="263">
more of a correct and regular dignity, throughout his work.</P>
<P>WHEN we begin to read the Iliad, we find our&s;elves in the region of the mo&s;t remote, and even unrefined antiquity. When we open the Aeneid, we di&s;cover all the correct|ne&s;s, and the improvements of the Augu&s;tan age. We meet with no contentions of heroes about a female &s;lave; no violent &s;colding, nor abu&s;ive language; but the Poem opens with the utmo&s;t magnificence; with Juno, forming de&s;igns for preventing Aeneas's e&s;|tabli&s;hment in Italy, and Aeneas him&s;elf, pre&s;ented to us with all his fleet, in the mid|dle of a &s;torm, which is de&s;cribed in the highe&s;t Style of Poetry.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of the Aeneid is extremely happy; &s;till more &s;o, in my opinion, than either of Homer's Poems. As nothing could be more noble, nor carry more of Epic dig|nity, &s;o nothing could be more flattering and intere&s;ting to the Roman people, than Virgil's deriving the origin of their &s;tate from &s;o famous a hero as Aeneas. The object was &s;plendid in it&s;elf; it gave the Poet a theme, taken from the ancient traditionary hi&s;tory of his own country; it allowed him to connect his &s;ubject with Homer's &s;tories, and to adopt all his mythology; it afforded him the op|portunity of frequently glancing at all the future great exploits of the Romans, and of de&s;cribing Italy, and the very territory of
<PB N="261" REF="264">
Rome, in its antient and fabulous &s;tate. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Aeneas con&s;tantly traver&s;ed by Juno, leads to a great diver&s;ity of events, of voyages, and wars; and furni&s;hes a pro|per intermixture of the incidents of peace with martial exploits. Upon the whole, I believe, there is no where to be found &s;o complete a model of an Epic Fable, or Story, as Virgil's Aeneid. I &s;ee no foundation for the opinion, entertained by &s;ome Critics, that the Aeneid is to be con&s;idered as an Al|legorical Poem, which carries a con&s;tant reference to the character and reign of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar; or, that Virgil's main de|&s;ign in compo&s;ing the Aeneid, was to recon|cile the Romans to the government of that Prince, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;hadowed out under the character of Aeneas. Virgil, in|deed, like the other Poets of that age, takes every opportunity which his &s;ubject affords him, of paying court to Augu&s;tus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As particularly in that noted pa&s;&s;age of the 6th book, l. 791.<Q><L>Hic vir, hic e&s;t, tibi quem promitti &s;aepius audis, &amp;c.</L></Q></NOTE>. But, to imagine that he carried a political plan in his view, through the whole Poem, appears to me, no more than a fanciful refinement. He had &s;ufficient motives, as a Poet, to de|termine him to the choice of his &s;ubject, from its being, in it&s;elf, both great and plea&s;|ing; from its being &s;uited to his genius, and its being attended with the peculiar advan|tages,
<PB N="262" REF="265">
which I mentioned above, for the full di&s;play of poetical talents.</P>
<P>UNITY of action is perfectly pre&s;erved; as, from beginning to end, one main object is always kept in view, the &s;ettlement of Aeneas, in Italy, by order of the Gods. As the &s;tory comprehends the tran&s;actions of &s;everal years, part of the tran&s;actions are very properly thrown into a recital made by the Hero. The Epi&s;odes are linked with &s;ufficient connection to the main &s;ubject; and the Nodus, or Intrigue of the Poem, is, according to the plan of ancient machinery, happily formed. The wrath of Juno, who oppo&s;es her&s;elf to the Trojan &s;ettlement in Italy, gives ri&s;e to all the difficulties which ob&s;truct Aeneas's undertaking, and connects the human with the cele&s;tial operations, throughout the whole work. Hence ari&s;e the tempe&s;t which throws Aeneas upon the &s;hore of Africa; the pa&s;&s;ion of Dido, who endeavours to detain him at Carthage; and the efforts of Turnus, who oppo&s;es him in war. Till, at la&s;t, upon a compo&s;ition made with Jupiter, that the Trojan name &s;hall be for ever &s;unk in the Latin, Juno fore|goes her re&s;entment, and the Hero becomes victorious.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e main points, Virgil has conducted his work with great propriety, and &s;hewn his art and judgment. But the admiration
<PB N="263" REF="266">
due to &s;o eminent a Poet, mu&s;t not prevent us from remarking &s;ome other particulars in which he has failed. Fir&s;t, there are almo&s;t no characters at all marked in the Aeneid. In this re&s;pect, it is in&s;ipid, when compared to the Iliad, which is full of characters and life. Achates, and Cloanthes, and Gyas, and the re&s;t of the Trojan heroes, who accom|panied Aeneas into Italy, are &s;o many un|di&s;tingui&s;hed figures, who are in no way made known to us, either by any &s;entiments which they utter, or any memorable exploits which they perform. Even Aeneas him&s;elf is not a very intere&s;ting Hero. He is de|&s;cribed, indeed, as pious and brave; but his character is not marked with any of tho&s;e &s;trokes that touch the heart; it is a &s;ort of cold and tame character; and throughout his behaviour to Dido, in the fourth book, e&s;pe|cially in the &s;peech which he makes after &s;he &s;u&s;pected his intention of leaving her, there appears a certain hardne&s;s, and want of re|lenting, which is far from rendering him amiable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q><L>Num fletu ingemuit no&s;tro? Num lumina flexit?</L>
<L>Num lacrymas victus dedit? Aut mi&s;eratus amantem e&s;t?</L>
<BIBL>AEN. iv. 368.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Dido's own character is by much the be&s;t &s;upported, in the whole Aeneid. The warmth of her pa&s;&s;ions, the keenne&s;s of her indignation and re&s;entment, and the vio|lence of her whole character, exhibit a figure greatly more animated than any other which Virgil has drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="267">
BESIDES this defect of character in the Aeneid, the di&s;tribution and management of the &s;ubject is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, exception|able. The Aeneid, it is true, mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered with the indulgence due to a work not thoroughly completed. The &s;ix la&s;t books, are &s;aid not to have received the fini&s;hing hand of the Author; and for this rea&s;on, he or|dered, by his will, the Aeneid to be commit|ted to the flames. But though this may ac|count for incorrectne&s;s of execution, it does not apologize for a falling off in the &s;ubject, which &s;eems to take place in the latter part of the work. The wars with the Latins are in|ferior, in point of dignity, to the more in|tere&s;ting objects which had before been pre|&s;ented to us, in the de&s;truction of Troy, the intrigue with Dido, and the de&s;cent into Hell. And into tho&s;e Italian wars, there is, perhaps, a more material fault &s;till, in the conduct of the &s;tory. The Reader, as Voltaire has ob&s;erved, is tempted to take part with Turnus again&s;t Aeneas. Turnus, a brave young prince, in love with Lavinia, his near relation, is de&s;tined for her by general con|&s;ent, and highly favoured by her mother. Lavinia her&s;elf di&s;covers no reluctance to the match: when there arrives a &s;tranger, a fu|gitive from a di&s;tant region, who had never &s;een her, and who founding a claim to an e&s;tabli&s;hment in Italy upon oracles and pro|phecies, embroils the country in war, kills the lover of Lavinia, and proves the occa&s;ion of her mother's death. Such a plan is not
<PB N="265" REF="268">
fortunately laid, for di&s;po&s;ing us to be fa|vourable to the Hero of the Poem; and the defect might have been ea&s;ily remedied, by the Poet's making Aeneas, in&s;tead of di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing Lavinia, deliver her from the per&s;ecution of &s;ome rival who was odious to her, and to the whole country.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e defects, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to remark, Virgil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es beauties which have ju&s;tly drawn the admi|ration of ages, and which, to this day, hold the balance in equilibrium between his fame, and that of Homer. The principal and di&s;|tingui&s;hing excellency of Virgil, and which, in my opinion, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es beyond all Poets, is Tenderne&s;s. Nature had endowed him with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility; he felt every af|fecting circum&s;tance in the &s;cenes he de|&s;cribes; and, by a &s;ingle &s;troke, he knows how to reach the heart. This, in an Epic Poem, is the merit next to &s;ublimity; and puts it in an Author's power to render his Compo&s;ition extremely intere&s;ting to all Readers.</P>
<P>THE chief beauty, of this kind, in the Iliad, is, the interview of Hector with An|dromache. But, in the Aeneid, there are many &s;uch. The &s;econd book is one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter-pieces that ever was executed by any hand; and Virgil &s;eems to have put forth there the whole &s;trength of his genius, as the &s;ubject afforded a variety of &s;cenes,
<PB N="266" REF="269">
both of the awful and tender kind. The images of horror, pre&s;ented by a city burned and &s;acked in the night, are finely mixed with pathetic and affecting incidents. Nothing, in any Poet, is more beautifully de&s;cribed than the death of old Priam; and the family-pieces of Aeneas, Anchi&s;es, and Creu&s;a, are as ten|der as can be conceived. In many pa&s;&s;ages of the Aeneid, the &s;ame pathetic &s;pirit &s;hines; and they have been always the favourite pa&s;|&s;ages in that work. The fourth book, for in|&s;tance, relating the unhappy pa&s;&s;ion and death of Dido, has been always mo&s;t ju&s;tly admi|red, and abounds with beauties of the highe&s;t kind. The interview of Aeneas with An|dromache and Helenus, in the third book; the Epi&s;odes of Pallas and Evander, of Ni&s;us and Euryalus, of Lau&s;us and Mezentius, in the Italian wars, are all &s;triking in&s;tances of the Poet's power of rai&s;ing the tender emo|tions. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that though the Aeneid be an unequal Poem, and, in &s;ome places, languid, yet there are beauties &s;cattered through it all; and not a few, even in the la&s;t &s;ix books. The be&s;t and mo&s;t fini&s;hed books, upon the whole, are the fir&s;t, the &s;econd, the fourth, the &s;ixth, the &s;e|venth, the eighth, and the twelfth.</P>
<P>VIRGIL's battles are far inferior to Ho|mer's, in point of fire and &s;ublimity: but there is one important Epi&s;ode, the de&s;cent into Hell, in which he has outdone Homer in the Ody&s;&s;ey, by many degrees. There is no|thing
<PB N="267" REF="270">
in all antiquity equal, in its kind, to the &s;ixth book of the Aeneid. The &s;cenery, and the objects are great and &s;triking; and fill the mind with that &s;olemn awe, which was to be expected from a view of the invi|&s;ible world. There runs through the whole de&s;cription, a certain philo&s;ophical &s;ublime; which Virgil's Platonic Genius, and the en|larged ideas of the Augu&s;tan Age, enabled him to &s;upport with a degree of maje&s;ty, far beyond what the rude ideas of Homer's age &s;uffered him to attain. With regard to the &s;weetne&s;s and beauty of Virgil's num|bers, throughout his whole works, they are &s;o well known, that it were needle&s;s to en|large in the prai&s;e of them.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, as to the comparative merit of the&s;e two great princes of Epic Poetry, Homer and Virgil; the former mu&s;t, undoubtedly, be admitted to be the greater Genius; the latter, to be the more correct Writer. Homer was an original in his art, and di&s;covers both the beauties, and the de|fects, which are to be expected in an original Author, compared with tho&s;e who &s;ucceed him; more boldne&s;s, more nature and ea&s;e, more &s;ublimity and force; but greater irre|gularities and negligencies in Compo&s;ition. Virgil has, all along, kept his eye upon Ho|mer; in many places, he has not &s;o much imitated, as he has literally tran&s;lated him. The de&s;cription of the Storm, for in&s;tance, in the fir&s;t Aeneid, and Aeneas's Speech upon
<PB N="268" REF="271">
that occa&s;ion, are tran&s;lations from the fifth book of the Ody&s;&s;ey; not to mention almo&s;t all the &s;imilies of Virgil, which are no other than copies of tho&s;e of Homer. The pre|eminence in invention, therefore, mu&s;t, be|yond doubt, be a&s;cribed to Homer. As to the pre-eminence in judgment, though many Critics incline to give it to Virgil, yet, in my opinion, it hangs doubtful. In Homer, we di&s;cern all the Greek vivacity; in Virgil, all the Roman &s;tateline&s;s. Homer's imagination is by much the mo&s;t rich and copious; Vir|gil's the mo&s;t cha&s;te and correct. The &s;trength of the former lies, in his power of warming the fancy; that of the latter, in his power of touching the heart. Homer's &s;tyle more &s;imple and animated; Virgil's more elegant and uniform. The fir&s;t has, on many occa&s;ions, a &s;ublimity to which the lat|ter never attains; but the latter, in return, never &s;inks below a certain degree of Epic dignity, which cannot &s;o clearly be pronoun|ced of the former. Not, however, to detract from the admiration due to both the&s;e great Poets, mo&s;t of Homer's defects may rea&s;ona|bly be imputed, not to his genius, but to the manners of the age in which he lived; and for the feeble pa&s;&s;ages of the Aeneid, this ex|cu&s;e ought to be admitted, that the Aeneid was left an unfini&s;hed work.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XLIV. LUCAN's PHARSALIA&mdash;TASSO's JERUSA|LEM&mdash;CAMOEN's LUSIAD&mdash;FENELON's TELEMACHUS&mdash;VOLTAIRE's HENRI|ADE&mdash;MILTON's PARADISE LOST.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Homer and Virgil, the next great Epic Poet of antient times, who pre&s;ents him&s;elf, is Lucan. He is a Poet who de&s;erves our attention, on account of a very peculiar mixture of great beauties, with great faults. Though his Phar&s;alia di&s;cover too little invention, and be conducted in too hi&s;torical a manner, to be accounted a per|fectly regular Epic Poem, yet it were the mere &s;queami&s;hne&s;s of Critici&s;m, to exclude it from the Epic Cla&s;s. The boundaries, as I formerly remarked, are far from being a&s;cer|tained by any &s;uch preci&s;e limit, that we mu&s;t refu&s;e the Epic name to a Poem, which treats of great and heroic adventures, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="270" REF="273">
it is not exactly conformable to the plans of Homer and Virgil. The &s;ubject of the Phar&s;alia carries, undoubtedly, all the Epic Grandeur and Dignity; neither does it want unity of object, viz. the Triumph of Cae&s;ar over the Roman Liberty. As it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, it is, indeed, brought to no proper clo&s;e. But either time has depriv|ed us of the la&s;t books, or it has been left by the Author an incomplete work.</P>
<P>THOUGH Lucan's &s;ubject be abundantly heroic, yet I cannot reckon him happy in the choice of it. It has two defects. The one is, that civil wars, e&s;pecially when as fierce and cruel as tho&s;e of the Romans, pre&s;ent too many &s;hocking objects to be fit for Epic Poetry, and give odious and di&s;gu&s;ting views of human nature. Gallant and honourable atchievements, furni&s;h a more proper theme for the Epic Mu&s;e. But Lucan's Genius, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;eems to delight in &s;avage &s;cenes; he dwells upon them too much; and not content with tho&s;e which his &s;ubject na|turally furni&s;hed, he goes out of his way to introduce a long Epi&s;ode of Marius and Sylla's pro&s;criptions, which abounds with all the forms of atrocious cruelty.</P>
<P>THE other defect of Lucan's &s;ubject is, its being too near the times in which he lived. This is a circum&s;tance, as I ob&s;erved in a former Lecture, always unlucky for a Poet; as it deprives him of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="271" REF="274">
fiction and machinery; and thereby renders his work le&s;s &s;plendid and amu&s;ing. Lucan has &s;ubmitted to this di&s;advantage of his &s;ub|ject; and in doing &s;o, has acted with more propriety, than if he had made an un&s;ea&s;on|able attempt to embelli&s;h it with machinery; for the fables of the Gods, would have made a very unnatural mixture with the exploits of Cae&s;ar and Pompey; and in&s;tead of rai&s;ing, would have dimini&s;hed the dignity of &s;uch recent, and well-known facts.</P>
<P>WITH regard to characters, Lucan draws them with &s;pirit, and with force. But, though Pompey be his profe&s;&s;ed Hero, he does not &s;ucceed in intere&s;ting us much in his favour. Pompey is not made to po&s;&s;e&s;s any high di&s;tinction, either for magnanimity in &s;entiment, or bravery in action; but, on the contrary, is always eclip&s;ed by the &s;uperior abilities of Cae&s;ar. Cato, is in truth, Lu|can's favourite character; and wherever he introduces him, he appears to ri&s;e above him|&s;elf. Some of the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous pa&s;&s;ages in the work, are &s;uch as relate to Cato; either &s;peeches put into his mouth, or de&s;criptions of his behaviour. His &s;peech, in particular, to Labienus, who urged him to enquire at the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon, concerning the i&s;&s;ue of the war [book ix. 564] de&s;erves to be remarked, as equal, for Moral Sublimity, to any thing that is to be found in all antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="275">
IN the conduct of the &s;tory, our Author has attached him&s;elf too much to chronolo|gical order. This renders the thread of his narration broken and interrupted, and makes him hurry us too often from place to place. He is too digre&s;&s;ive al&s;o; frequently turning a&s;ide from his &s;ubject, to give us, &s;ometimes, geographical de&s;criptions of a country; &s;ome|times philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions concerning natural objects; as, concerning the African Serpents in the ninth book, and the &s;ources of the Nile in the tenth.</P>
<P>THERE are, in the Phar&s;alia, &s;everal very poetical, and &s;pirited de&s;criptions. But the Author's chief &s;trength does not lie, either in Narration or De&s;cription. His Narration is often dry and har&s;h; his De&s;criptions are often over-wrought, and employed too upon di&s;agreeable objects. His principal merit con&s;i&s;ts in his &s;entiments, which are gene|rally noble and &s;triking, and expre&s;&s;ed in that glowing and ardent manner, which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes him. Lucan is the mo&s;t philo|&s;ophical, and the mo&s;t public-&s;pirited Poet, of all antiquity. He was the nephew of the famous Seneca, the Philo&s;opher; was him|&s;elf a Stoick; and the &s;pirit of that Philo&s;o|phy breathes throughout his Poem. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve too, that he is the only ancient Epic Poet whom the &s;ubject of his Poem really and deeply intere&s;ted. Lucan recounted no fiction. He was a Roman and had felt all the direful effects of the Roman civil wars,
<PB N="273" REF="276">
and of that &s;evere de&s;poti&s;m which &s;ucceeded the lo&s;s of Liberty. His high and bold &s;pirit made him enter deeply into this &s;ubject, and kindle on many occa&s;ions, into the mo&s;t real warmth. Hence, he abounds in exclamati|ons and apo&s;trophes, which are, almo&s;t always, well-timed, and &s;upported with a vivacity and fire that do him no &s;mall ho|nour.</P>
<P>BUT it is the fate of this Poet, that his beauties can never be mentioned, without their &s;ugge&s;ting his blemi&s;hes al&s;o. As his principal excellency is a lively and glowing genius, which appears, &s;ometimes, in his de&s;criptions, and very often in his &s;entiments, his great defect in both is, want of modera|tion. He carries every thing to an extreme. He knows not where to &s;top. From an ef|fort to aggrandi&s;e his objects, he becomes tumid and unnatural: and it frequently hap|pens, that where the &s;econd line of one of his de&s;criptions is &s;ublime, the third, in which he meant to ri&s;e &s;till higher, is per|fectly bomba&s;t. Lucan lived in an age, when the Schools of the Declaimers had be|gun to corrupt the Eloquence, and Ta&s;te of Rome. He was not free from the infection; and too often, in&s;tead of &s;howing the genius of the Poet, betrays the &s;pirit of the De|claimer.</P>
<P>ON the whole, however, he is an Author of lively and original genius. His &s;entiments
<PB N="274" REF="277">
are &s;o high, and his fire, on occa&s;ions, &s;o great, as to atone for many of his defects; and pa&s;&s;ages can be produced from him, which are inferior to none in any Poet what|ever. The characters, for in&s;tance, which he draws of Pompey and Cae&s;ar in the fir&s;t Book, are ma&s;terly; and the compari&s;on of Pompey to the aged decaying oak is highly poetical:<Q><L>&mdash;totus popularibus auris</L>

BUT when we con&s;ider the whole execu|tion of his Poem, we are obliged to pro|nounce, that his Poetical fire was not under the government of either &s;ound judgment, or correct ta&s;te. His genius had &s;trength, but not tenderne&s;s; nothing of what may be called amoenity, or &s;weetne&s;s. In his Style, there is abundance of force; but a mixture of har&s;hne&s;s, and frequently of ob&s;curity, oc|ca&s;ioned by his de&s;ire of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in a pointed and unu&s;ual manner. Compared with Virgil, he may be allowed to have more fine and higher &s;entiments, but in every thing el&s;e, falls infinitely below him, particularly in purity, elegance, and tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="279">
AS Statius and Silius Italicus, though they be Poets of the Epic Cla&s;s, are too incon&s;i|derable for particular critici&s;m, I proceed next to Ta&s;&s;o, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Epic Poet in Modern Ages.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Jeru&s;alem Delivered,</HI> was publi&s;hed in the year 1574. It is a Poem regularly and &s;trictly Epic, in its whole con&s;truction; and adorned with all the beauties that belong to that &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition. The &s;ubject is, the Recovery of Jeru&s;alem from the Infidels, by the united powers of Chri&s;tendom; which, in it&s;elf, and more e&s;pecially according to the ideas of Ta&s;&s;o's age, was a &s;plendid, venera|ble, and heroic enterpri&s;e. The oppo&s;ition of the Chri&s;tians to the Saracens, forms an in|tere&s;ting contra&s;t. The &s;ubject produces none of tho&s;e fierce and &s;hocking &s;cenes of civil di&s;cord, which hurt the mind in Lucan, but exhibits the efforts of zeal and bravery, in&s;pired by an honourable object. The &s;hare which religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the enterprize, both tends to render it more augu&s;t, and opens a natural field for machinery, and &s;ub|lime de&s;cription. The action too lies in a country, and at a period of time, &s;ufficiently remote to allow an intermixture of fabulous tradition and fiction with true Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IN the conduct of the &s;tory, Ta&s;&s;o has &s;hown a rich and fertile invention, which, in a Poet, is a capital quality. He is full of events; and tho&s;e too abundantly various,
<PB N="277" REF="280">
and diver&s;ified in their kind. He never al|lows us to be tired by mere war and fighting. He frequently &s;hifts the &s;cene; and, from camps and battles, tran&s;ports us to more plea&s;ing objects. Sometimes the &s;olemnities of religion; &s;ometimes the intrigues of love; at other times, the adventures of a journey, or even the incidents of pa&s;toral life, relieve and entertain the Reader. At the &s;ame time, the whole work is artfully connected, and while there is much variety in the parts, there is perfect unity in the plan. The recovery of Jeru&s;alem is the object kept in view through the whole, and with it the Poem clo&s;es. All the Epi&s;odes, if we except that of Olindo and Sophronia, in the &s;econd Book, on which I formerly pa&s;&s;ed a cen&s;ure, are &s;ufficiently related to the main &s;ubject of the Poem.</P>
<P>THE Poem is enlivened with a variety of characters, and tho&s;e too both clearly marked and well &s;upported. Godfrey, the leader of the enterpri&s;e, prudent, moderate, brave; Tancred, amorous, generous, and gallant, and well contra&s;ted with the fierce and brutal Argantes; Rinaldo, (who is properly the Hero of the Poem, and is in part copied after Homer's Achilles) pa&s;&s;ionate and re&s;entful, &s;educed by the allurements of Armida; but a per&s;onage, on the whole, of much zeal, ho|nour, and heroi&s;m. The brave and high|minded Solyman, the tender Erminia, the artful and violent Armida, the ma&s;culine Clo|rinda;
<PB N="278" REF="281">
are all of them well drawn and ani|mated figures. In the characteri&s;tical part, Ta&s;&s;o is indeed remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed; he is, in this re&s;pect, &s;uperior to Virgil; and yields to no Poet, except to Homer.</P>
<P>HE abounds very much with machinery; and in this part of the work his merit is more dubious. Wherever caele&s;tial beings are made to interpo&s;e, his machinery is noble. God looking down upon the ho&s;ts, and, on different occa&s;ions, &s;ending an Angel to check the Pagans, and to rebuke the evil &s;pirits, produces a &s;ublime effect. The de&s;cription of Hell too, with the appearance and Speech of Satan, in the beginning of the 4th book, is extremely &s;triking; and plainly has been imitated by Milton, though he mu&s;t be al|lowed to have improved upon it. But the devils, the enchanters, and the conjurers, act too great a part throughout Ta&s;&s;o's Poem; and form a &s;ort of dark and gloomy machi|nery, not plea&s;ing to the imagination. The enchanted wood, on which the Nodus, or Intrigue of the Poem, is made in a great mea&s;ure to depend; the me&s;&s;engers &s;ent in que&s;t of Rinaldo, in order that he may break the charm; their being conducted by a Her|mit to a cave in the centre of the earth; the wonderful voyage which they make to the fortunate i&s;lands; and their recovering Rinaldo from the charms of Armida and vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s; are &s;cenes which, though very amu&s;ing, and de&s;cribed with the highe&s;t
<PB N="279" REF="282">
beauty of Poetry, yet mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to carry the marvellous to a degree of extra|vagance.</P>
<P>IN general, that for which Ta&s;&s;o is mo&s;t liable to cen&s;ure, is a certain romantic vein, which runs through many of the adventures and incidents of his Poem. The objects which he pre&s;ents to us, are always great; but &s;ometimes, too remote from probability. He retains &s;omewhat of the ta&s;te of his age, which was not reclaimed from an extra va|gant admiration of the &s;tories of Knight er|rantry; &s;tories, which the wild, but rich and agreeable imagination of Ario&s;to, had rai&s;ed into fre&s;h reputation. In apology, however, for Ta&s;&s;o, it may be &s;aid, that he is not more marvellous and romantic than either Homer, or Virgil. All the difference is, that in the one we find the Romance of Pagani&s;m, in the other, that of Chivalry.</P>
<P>WITH all the beauties of de&s;cription, and of Poetical Style, Ta&s;&s;o remarkably abounds. Both his de&s;criptions, and his Style, are much diver&s;ified, and well &s;uited to each other. In de&s;cribing magnificent objects, his Style is firm and maje&s;tic; when he de&s;cends to gay and plea&s;ing ones, &s;uch as Erminia's Pa&s;toral Retreat in the Seventh Book, and the Arts and Beauty of Armida in the Fourth Book, it is &s;oft and in&s;inuating. Both tho&s;e de&s;criptions, which I have mentioned, are exqui&s;ite in their kind. His battles are animated, and very properly
<PB N="280" REF="283">
varied in the incidents; inferior however to Homer's in point of &s;pirit and fire.</P>
<P>IN his &s;entiments, Ta&s;&s;o is not &s;o happy as in his de&s;criptions. It is indeed rather by actions, characters, and de&s;criptions, that he intere&s;ts us, than by the &s;entimental part of the work. He is far inferior to Virgil in ten|derne&s;s. When he aims at being pathetic and &s;entimental in his &s;peeches, he is apt to become artificial and &s;trained.</P>
<P>WITH regard to points and conceits, with which he has often been reproached, the cen&s;ure has been carried too far. Affectation is by no means the general character of Ta&s;|&s;o's manner, which, upon the whole, is ma&s;|culine, &s;trong, and correct. On &s;ome occa|&s;ions, indeed, e&s;pecially as I ju&s;t now ob|&s;erved, when he &s;eeks to be tender, he de|generates into forced and unnatural ideas; but the&s;e are far from being &s;o frequent or common as has been &s;uppo&s;ed. Three&s;core or four&s;core lines retrenched from the Poem, would fully clear it, I am per&s;uaded, of all &s;uch exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>WITH Boileau, Dacier, and the other French Critics of the la&s;t age, the humour prevailed of decrying Ta&s;&s;o; and pa&s;&s;ed from them to &s;ome of the Engli&s;h Writers. But one would be apt to imagine, they were not much acquainted with Ta&s;&s;o; or at lea&s;t
<PB N="281" REF="284">
they mu&s;t have read him, under the influence of &s;trong prejudices. For to me it appears clear, that the Jeru&s;alem is, in rank and dig|nity, the third regular Epic Poem in the World; and comes next to the Iliad and Aeneid. Ta&s;&s;o may be ju&s;tly held inferior to Homer, in &s;implicity and in fire; to Virgil, in tenderne&s;s; to Milton, in daring &s;ublimity of genius; but to no other he yields in any poetical talents; and for fertility of inven|tion, variety of incidents, expre&s;&s;ion of cha|racters, richne&s;s of de&s;cription, and beauty of Style, I know no Poet, except the three ju&s;t named, that can be compared to him.</P>
<P>ARIOSTO, the great rival of Ta&s;&s;o, in Ita|lian Poetry, cannot with any propriety, be cla&s;&s;ed among the Epic Writers. The fun|damental rule of Epic Compo&s;ition is, to re|count a heroic enterpri&s;e, and to form it into a regular &s;tory. Though there is a &s;ort of unity and connection in the plan of Orlando Furio&s;o, yet, in&s;tead of rendering this appa|rent to the Reader, it &s;eems to have been the Author's intention to keep it out of view, by the de&s;ultory manner in which the Poem is carried on, and the perpetual interruptions of the &s;everal &s;tories before they are fini&s;hed. Ario&s;to appears to have de&s;pi&s;ed all regula|rity of plan, and to have cho&s;en to give loo&s;e reins to a copious and rich, but extravagant fancy. At the &s;ame time, there is &s;o much Epic matter in the Orlando Furio&s;o, that it would be improper to pa&s;s it by without &s;ome
<PB N="282" REF="285">
notice. It unites indeed all &s;orts of Poetry; &s;ometimes Comic and Satiric; &s;ometimes light and licentious; at other times highly heroic, de&s;criptive, and tender. Whatever &s;train the Poet a&s;&s;umes, he excels in it. He is always ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject; &s;eems to play him&s;elf with it; and leaves us &s;ome|times at a lo&s;s to know whether he be &s;eri|ous, or in je&s;t. He is &s;eldom dramatic; &s;ometimes, but not often, &s;entimental; but in narration and de&s;cription, perhaps no Poet ever went beyond him. He makes every &s;cene which he de&s;cribes, and every event which he relates, pa&s;s before our eyes; and in his &s;election of circum&s;tances, is eminently picture&s;que. His Style is much varied, al|ways &s;uited to the &s;ubject, and adorned with a remarkably &s;mooth and melodious Ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>As the Italians make their boa&s;t of Ta&s;&s;o, &s;o do the Portugue&s;e of Camoens; who was nearly cotemporary with Ta&s;&s;o, but who&s;e Poem was publi&s;hed before the Jeru&s;alem. The &s;ubject of it, is the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the Ea&s;t Indies by Va&s;co de Gama; an enter|pri&s;e &s;plendid in its nature, and extremely intere&s;ting to the countrymen of Camoens, as it laid the foundation of their future wealth and con&s;ideration in Europe. The Poem opens with Va&s;co and his fleet appearing on the ocean, between the i&s;land Madaga&s;car, and the coa&s;t of Aethiopia. After various attempts to land on that coa&s;t, they are at
<PB N="283" REF="286">
la&s;t ho&s;pitably received in the kingdom of Melinda. Va&s;co, at the de&s;ire of the King, gives him an account of Europe, recites a poetical hi&s;tory of Portugal, and relates all the adventures of the voyage, which had preceded the opening of the Poem. This recital takes up three Cantos, or Books. It is well imagined; contains a great many poe|tical beauties; and has no defect, except that Va&s;co makes an un&s;ea&s;onable di&s;play of learning to the African Prince, in frequent allu&s;ions to the Greek and Roman hi&s;tories. Va&s;co and his countrymen afterward &s;et forth to pur&s;ue their voyage. The &s;torms and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which they encounter; their arrival at Calecut on the Malabar coa&s;t; their recep|tion and adventures in that country, and at la&s;t their return homewards, fill up the re&s;t of the Poem.</P>
<P>THE whole work is conducted according to the Epic Plan. Both the &s;ubject and the incidents are magnificent; and, joined with &s;ome wildne&s;s and irregularity, there appears in the execution much poetic &s;pirit, &s;trong fancy, and bold de&s;cription; as far as I can judge from tran&s;lations, without any knowledge of the original. There is no attempt towards painting characters in the Poem; Va&s;co is the hero, and the only per&s;onage indeed that makes any figure.</P>
<P>THE machinery of the Lu&s;iad is perfectly extravagant; not only is it formed of a &s;in|gular
<PB N="284" REF="287">
mixture of Chri&s;tian ideas, and Pagan mythology; but it is &s;o conducted, that the Pagan Gods appear to be the true Deities, and Chri&s;t and the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, to be &s;ubordi|nate agents. One great &s;cope of the Portu|gue&s;e expedition, our Author informs us, is to propagate the Chri&s;tian faith, and to extir|pate Mahometani&s;m. In this religious under|taking, the great protector of the Portugue&s;e is Venus, and their great adver&s;ary is Bacchus, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure is excited, by Va&s;co's at|tempting to rival his fame in the Indies. Councils of the Gods are held, in which Ju|piter is introduced, as foretelling the downfal of Mahometani&s;m, and the propagation of the Go&s;pel. Va&s;co, in great di&s;tre&s;s from a &s;trom, prays mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to God; implores the aid of Chri&s;t and the Virgin, and begs for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as was given to the I&s;raelites, when they were pa&s;&s;ing through the Red Sea, and to the Apo&s;tle Paul, when he was in hazard of &s;hipwreck. In return to this prayer, Venus appears, who di&s;cerning the &s;torm to be the work of Bacchus, complains to Jupi|ter, and procures the winds to be calmed. Such &s;trange and prepo&s;terous machinery, &s;hows how much Authors have been mi&s;led by the ab&s;urd opinion, that there could be no Epic Poetry without the Gods of Homer. Towards the end of the work, indeed, the Author gives us an aukward &s;alvo for his whole Mythology; making the Godde&s;s The|tis inform Va&s;co, that &s;he, and the re&s;t of the

<PB N="285" REF="288">
Heathen Deities, are no more than names to de&s;cribe the operations of Providence.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, &s;ome fine machinery, of a different kind, in the Lu&s;iad. The genius of the river Ganges appearing to Ema|nuel, King of Portugal, in a dream, inviting that Prince to di&s;cover his &s;ecret &s;prings, and acquainting him, that he was the de&s;tined monarch for whom the trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t were re&s;erved, is a happy idea. But the noble&s;t conception of this &s;ort, is in the Fifth Canto, where Va&s;co is recounting to the King of Melinda, all the wonders which he met with in his navigation. He tells him, that when the fleet arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, which never before had been doubled by any navigator, there appeared to them, on a &s;udden, a huge and mon&s;trous fantom ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, in the mid&s;t of tempe&s;ts and thunders, with a head that reached the clouds, and a countenance that filled them with terror. This was the genius, or guardian, of that hitherto unknown ocean. It &s;poke to them with a voice like thunder; menaced them, for invading tho&s;e &s;eas which he had &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed undi&s;turbed; and for daring to explore tho&s;e &s;ecrets of the deep, which never had been revealed to the eye of mortals; required them to proceed no farther; if they &s;hould proceed, foretold all the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive calamities that were to befal them; and then, with a mighty noi&s;e, di&s;appeared. This is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;triking
<PB N="286" REF="289">
pieces of machinery that ever was employed; and is &s;ufficient to &s;how that Camoens is a Poet, though of an irregular, yet of a bold and lofty imagination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I have made no mention of the Araucana, an Epic Poem, in Spani&s;h, compo&s;ed by Alonzo d'Ercilla, becau&s;e I am unacquainted with the original language, and have not &s;een any tran&s;lation of it. A full account of it is given by Mr. Hayley, in the Notes upon his E&s;&s;ay on Epic Poetry.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN reviewing the Epic Poets, it were unju&s;t to make no mention of the amiable Author of the Adventures of Telemachus. His work, though not compo&s;ed in ver&s;e, is ju&s;tly enti|tled to be held a Poem. The mea&s;ured poeti|cal Pro&s;e, in which it was written, is remark|ably harmonious; and gives the Style nearly as much elevation as the French language is capable of &s;upporting, even in regular Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>THE plan of the work is, in general, well contrived; and is deficient neither in Epic grandeur, nor unity of object. The Author has entered with much felicity into the &s;pirit and ideas of the Ancient Poets, particularly into the Ancient Mythology, which retains more dignity, and makes a better figure in his hands, than in tho&s;e of any other Modern Poet. His de&s;criptions are rich and beauti|ful; e&s;pecially of the &s;ofter and calmer &s;cenes, for which the genius of Fenelon was be&s;t &s;uited; &s;uch as the incidents of pa&s;toral life,
<PB N="287" REF="290">
the plea&s;ures of virtue, or a country flouri&s;h|ing in peace. There is an inimitable &s;weet|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s in &s;everal of the pictures of this kind, which he has given.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t executed part of the work, is the fir&s;t Six Books, in which Telemachus recounts his adventures to Calyp&s;o. The narration, throughout them, is lively and intere&s;ting. Afterwards, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t Twelve Books, it becomes more tedious and languid; and in the warlike adventures which are at|tempted, there is a great defect of vigour. The chief objection again&s;t this work being cla&s;&s;ed with Epic Poems, ari&s;es from the mi|nute detail of virtuous policy, into which the Author in &s;ome places enters; and from the di&s;cour&s;es and in&s;tructions of Mentor, which recur upon us too often, and too much in the &s;train of common-place morality. Though the&s;e were well &s;uited to the main de&s;ign of the Author, which was to form the mind of a young Prince, yet they &s;eem not congruous to the nature of Epic Poetry; the object of which is to improve us by means of actions, characters, and &s;entiments, rather than by delivering profe&s;&s;ed and formal in&s;truction.</P>
<P>SEVERAL of the Epic Poets have de&s;cribed a de&s;cent into Hell; and in the pro&s;pects they have given us of the invi&s;ible world, we may ob&s;erve the gradual refinement of men's noti|ons, concerning a &s;tate of future rewards and puni&s;hments. The de&s;cent of Uly&s;&s;es into
<PB N="288" REF="291">
Hell, in Homer's Ody&s;&s;ey, pre&s;ents to us a very indi&s;tinct and dreary &s;ort of object. The &s;cene is laid in the country of the Cimmerians, which is always covered with clouds and darkne&s;s, at the extremity, of the ocean. When the &s;pirits of the dead begin to appear, we &s;carcely know whether Uly&s;&s;es is above ground, or below it. None of the gho&s;ts, even of the heroes, appear &s;atisfied with their condition in the other world; and when Uly&s;&s;es endeavours to comfort Achilles, by reminding him of the illu&s;trious figure which he mu&s;t make in tho&s;e regions, Achilles roundly tells him, that all &s;uch &s;peeches are idle; for he would rather be a day-labourer on earth, than have the command of all the dead.</P>
<P>IN the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, we di&s;|cern a much greater refinement of ideas, corre&s;ponding to the progre&s;s which the world had then made in philo&s;ophy. The objects there delineated, are both more clear and di&s;|tinct and more grand and awful. The &s;eparate man&s;ions of good and of bad &s;pirits, with the puni&s;hments of the one, and the em|ployments and happine&s;s of the other, are finely de&s;cribed; and in con&s;i&s;tency with the mo&s;t pure morality. But the vi&s;it which Fenelon makes Telemachus pay to the &s;hades, is much more philo&s;ophical &s;till than Virgil's. He employs the &s;ame fables and the &s;ame mythology; but we find the ancient mytho|logy refined by the knowledge of the true
<PB N="289" REF="292">
religion, and adorned with that beautiful en|thu&s;ia&s;m, for which Fenelon was &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. His account of the happine&s;s of the ju&s;t is an excellent de&s;cription in the my&s;tic &s;train; and very expre&s;&s;ive of the genius and &s;pirit of the Author.</P>
<P>VOLTAIRE has given us in his Henriade, a regular Epic Poem, in French ver&s;e. In every performance of that celebrated Writer, we may expect to find marks of genius; and, accordingly, that work di&s;covers, in &s;everal places, that boldne&s;s in the conceptions, and that liveline&s;s and felicity in the expre&s;&s;ion, for which the Author is &s;o remarkably di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. Several of the compari&s;ons, in par|ticular, which occur in it, are both new and happy. But con&s;idered upon the whole, I cannot e&s;teem it one of his chief productions; and am of opinion, that he has &s;ucceeded infinitely better in Tragic, than in Epic Com|po&s;ition. French Ver&s;ification &s;eems ill adap|ted to Epic Poetry. Be&s;ides it being always fettered by rhyme, the language never a&s;&s;umes a &s;ufficient degree of elevation or maje&s;ty; and appears to be more capable of expre&s;&s;ing the tender in Tragedy, than of &s;upporting the &s;ublime in Epic. Hence a feeblene&s;s, and &s;ometimes a pro&s;aic flatne&s;s, in the Style of the Henriade; and whether from this, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, the Poem often lan|gui&s;hes. It does not &s;eize the imagination; nor intere&s;t and carry the Reader along, with
<PB N="290" REF="293">
that ardour which ought to be in&s;pired by a &s;ublime and &s;pirited Epic Poem.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of the Henriade, is the triumph of Henry the Fourth over the Arms of the League. The action of the Poem, properly includes only the Siege of Paris. It is in action perfectly Epic in its nature; great, intere&s;ting, and conducted with a &s;ufficient regard to unity and all the other critical rules. But it is liable to both the defects which I before remarked in Lucan's Phar&s;alia. It is founded wholly on civil wars; and pre&s;ents to us tho&s;e odious and dete&s;table objects of ma&s;&s;acres and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, which throw a gloom over the Poem. It is al&s;o, like Lucan's of too recent a date, and comes too much within the bounds of well known hi&s;tory. To remedy this la&s;t defect, and to remove the appearance of being a mere hi&s;torian, Voltaire has cho&s;en to mix fiction with truth. The Poem, for in&s;tance, opens with a voy|age of Henry's to England, and an inter|view between him and Queen Elizabeth; though every one knows that Henry never was in England, and that the&s;e two illu&s;tri|ous per&s;onages never met. In facts of &s;uch public notoriety, a fiction like this &s;hocks the Reader, and forms an unnatural and ill-&s;orted mixture with hi&s;torical truth. The Epi&s;ode was contrived, in order to give Henry an opportunity of recounting the former tran&s;ac|tions of the civil wars, in imitation of the recital which Aeneas makes to Dido in the
<PB N="291" REF="294">
Aeneid. But the imitation was injudicious. Aeneas might, with propriety, relate to Dido, tran&s;actions of which &s;he was either entirely ignorant, or had acquired only an imperfect knowledge by flying reports. But Queen Elizabeth could not but be &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfectly appri&s;ed of all the facts, which the Poet makes Henry recite to her.</P>
<P>IN order to embelli&s;h his &s;ubject, Voltaire has cho&s;en to employ a great deal of machi|nery. But here al&s;o, I am obliged to cen&s;ure his conduct; for the machinery which he chiefly employs, is of the wor&s;t kind, and the lea&s;t &s;uited to an Epic Poem, that of al|legorical beings. Di&s;cord, Cunning, and Love, appear as per&s;onages, mix with the human actors, and make a con&s;iderable figure in the intrigue of the Poem. This is contrary to every rule of rational critici&s;m. Gho&s;ts, An|gels, and Devils have popular belief on their &s;ide, and can be conceived as exi&s;ting. But every one knows, that allegorical beings are no more than repre&s;entations of human di&s;po&s;itions and pa&s;&s;ions. They may be em|ployed like other Per&s;onifications and Figures of Speech; or in a Poem, that is wholly al|legorical, they may occupy the chief place. They are there in their native and proper re|gion; but in a Poem which relates to human tran&s;actions, as I had occa&s;ion before to re|mark, when &s;uch beings are de&s;cribed as acting along with men, the imagination is
<PB N="292" REF="295">
confounded; it is divided between phanta&s;ms and realities, and knows not on what to re&s;t.</P>
<P>IN ju&s;tice, however, to our Author, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the machinery of St. Louis, which he al&s;o employs, is of a better kind, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es real dignity. The fine&s;t pa&s;|&s;age in the Henriade, indeed one of the fine&s;t that occurs in any Poem, is the pro&s;pect of the invi&s;ible world, which St. Louis gives to Henry in a dream, in the Seventh Canto. Death bringing the &s;ouls of the departed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before God; their a&s;toni&s;hment when arriving from all different countries and religious &s;ects, they are brought into the Divine Pre&s;ence; when they find their &s;uper|&s;titions to be fal&s;e, and have the truth un|veiled to them; the palace of the De&s;tinies opened to Henry, and the pro&s;pect of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors which is there given him; are &s;triking and magnificent objects, and do ho|nour to the genius of Voltaire.</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;ome of the Epi&s;odes in this Poem are properly extended, yet the narra|tion is, on the whole, too general; the events are too much crowded, and &s;uperficially re|lated; which is, doubtle&s;s, one cau&s;e of the Poem making a faint impre&s;&s;ion. The &s;train of &s;entiment which runs through it, is high and noble. Religion appears, on every oc|ca&s;ion, with great and proper lu&s;tre; and the Author breathes that &s;pirit of humanity
<PB N="293" REF="296">
and toleration, which is con&s;picuous in all his works.</P>
<P>MILTON, of whom it remains now to &s;peak, has chalked out for him&s;elf a new, and very extraordinary road, in Poetry. As &s;oon as we open his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, we find our&s;elves introduced all at once into an invi|&s;ible world, and &s;urrounded with cele&s;tial and infernal beings. Angels and Devils, are not the machinery, but principal Actors, in the Poem; and what, in any other compo&s;i|tion, would be the marvellous, is here only the natural cour&s;e of events. A &s;ubject &s;o remote from the affairs of this world, may furni&s;h ground to tho&s;e who think &s;uch di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions material, to bring it into doubt, whether Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t can properly be cla&s;&s;ed among Epic Poems. By whatever name it is to be called, it is, undoubtedly, one of the highe&s;t efforts of poetical genius; and in one great characteri&s;tic of the Epic Poem, Maje&s;ty and Sublimity, it is fully equal to any that bear that name.</P>
<P>HOW far the Author was altogether happy in the choice of his &s;ubject, may be que&s;|tioned. It has led him into very difficult ground. Had he taken a &s;ubject that was more human, and le&s;s theological; that was more connected with the occurrences of life, and afforded a greater di&s;play of the charac|ters and pa&s;&s;ions of men, his Poem would, perhaps, have to the bulk of Readers, been
<PB N="294" REF="297">
more plea&s;ing and attractive. But the &s;ub|ject which he has cho&s;en, &s;uited the daring &s;ublimity of his genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"He &s;eems to have been well acquainted with his own genius, and to know what it was that nature had be|&s;towed upon him more bountifully than upon others; the power of di&s;playing the va&s;t, illuminating the &s;plendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy, and aggra|vating the dreadful. He therefore cho&s;e a &s;ubject, on which too much could not be &s;aid; on which he might tire his fancy, without the cen&s;ure of extravagance." <BIBL>DR. JOHNSON'S Life of Milton.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. It is a &s;ubject for which Milton alone was fitted; and in the conduct of it, he has &s;hewn a &s;tretch both of imagination and invention, which is perfectly wonderful. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how, from the few hints given us in the Sacred Scriptures, he was able to rai&s;e &s;o complete and regular a &s;tructure; and to fill his Poem with &s;uch a variety of incidents. Dry and har&s;h pa&s;|&s;ages &s;ometimes occur. The Author ap|pears, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, a Metaphy&s;ician and a Divine, rather than a Poet. But the general tenor of his work is intere&s;ting; he &s;eizes and fixes the imagination; engages, elevates, and affects us as we proceed; which is always a &s;ure te&s;t of merit in an Epic Com|po&s;ition. The artful change of his objects; the &s;cene laid now in Earth, now in Hell, and now in Heaven, affords a &s;ufficient di|ver&s;ity; while unity of plan is, at the &s;ame time perfectly &s;upported. We have &s;till life, and calm &s;cenes, in the employments of Adam and Eve in Paradi&s;e; and we have
<PB N="295" REF="298">
bu&s;y &s;cenes and great actions, in the enter|pri&s;e of Satan, and the wars of the Angels. The innocence, purity, and amiablene&s;s of our fir&s;t parents, oppo&s;ed to the pride and ambition of Satan, furni&s;hes a happy con|tra&s;t, that reigns throughout the whole Poem; only the conclu&s;ion, as I before ob&s;erved, is too tragic for Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>THE nature of the &s;ubject did not admit any great di&s;play of characters; but &s;uch as could be introduced, are &s;upported with much propriety. Satan, in particular, makes a &s;triking figure, and is, indeed, the be&s;t drawn character in the Poem. Milton has not de&s;cribed him, &s;uch as we &s;uppo&s;e an in|fernal &s;pirit to be. He has, more &s;uitably to his own purpo&s;e, given him a human, that is, a mixed character, not altogether void of &s;ome good qualities. He is brave and faith|ful to his troops. In the mid&s;t of his im|piety, he is not without remor&s;e. He is even touched with pity for our fir&s;t parents; and ju&s;tifies him&s;elf in his de&s;ign again&s;t them, from the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation. He is actuated by ambition and re&s;entment, rather than by pure malice. In &s;hort, Mil|ton's Satan is no wor&s;e than many a con&s;pi|rator or factious chief, that makes a figure in hi&s;tory. The different characters of Beel|zebub, Moloch, Belial, are exceedingly well painted in tho&s;e eloquent &s;peeches which they make, in the Second Book. The good Angels, though always de&s;cribed with digni|ty
<PB N="296" REF="299">
and propriety, have more uniformity than the infernal Spirits in their appearance; though among them, too, the mild con|de&s;cen&s;ion of Raphael, and the tried fidelity of Abdiel, form proper characteri&s;tical di&s;|tinctions. The attempt to de&s;cribe God Almighty him&s;elf, and to recount dialogues between the Father and the Son, was too bold and arduous, and is that wherein our Poet, as was to have been expected, has been mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful. With regard to his human characters; the innocence of our fir&s;t parents, and their love, are finely and delicately painted. In &s;ome of his &s;peeches to Raphael and to Eve, Adam is, perhaps, too knowing and refined for his &s;ituation. Eve is more di&s;tinctly characteri&s;ed. Her gentlene&s;s, mo|de&s;ty, and frailty, mark very expre&s;&s;ively a female character.</P>
<P>MILTON'S great and di&s;tingui&s;hing excel|lence, is, his &s;ublimity. In this, perhaps, he excels Homer; as there is no doubt of his leaving Virgil, and every other Poet, far be|hind him. Almo&s;t the whole of the Fir&s;t and Second books of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, are continued in&s;tances of the highe&s;t &s;ublime. The pro&s;pect of Hell and of the fallen Ho&s;t, the appearance and behaviour of Satan, the con&s;ultation of the infernal Chiefs, and Satan's flight through Chaos to the borders of this world, di&s;cover the mo&s;t lofty ideas that ever entered into the conception of any Poet. In the Sixth Book al&s;o, there is much gran|deur,
<PB N="297" REF="300">
particularly in the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah; though &s;ome parts of that book are cen&s;urable; and the wittici&s;ms of the Devils upon the effect of their artillery, form an intolerable blemi&s;h. Milton's &s;ublimity is of a different kind from that of Homer. Ho|mer's is generally accompanied with fire and impetuo&s;ity; Milton's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more of a calm and amazing grandeur. Homer warms and hurries us along; Milton fixes us in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;hment and elevation. Homer's &s;ublimity appears mo&s;t in the de&s;cription of actions; Milton's, in that of wonderful and &s;tupendous objects.</P>
<P>BUT though Milton is mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;ublimity, yet there is al&s;o much of the beautiful, the tender, and the plea&s;ing, in many parts of his work. When the &s;cene is laid in Paradi&s;e, the imagery is always of the mo&s;t gay and &s;miling kind. His de&s;crip|tions &s;how an uncommonly fertile imaginati|on; and in his &s;imilies, he is, for the mo&s;t part, remarkably happy. They are &s;eldom improperly introduced; &s;eldom either low, or trite. They generally pre&s;ent to us images taken from the &s;ublime or the beautiful cla&s;s of objects; if they have any faults, it is their alluding too frequently to matters of learning, and to fables of antiquity. In the latter part of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, there mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;|ed to be a falling off. With the fall of our fir&s;t parents, Milton's genius &s;eems to decline. Beauties, however, there are, in the con|cluding
<PB N="298" REF="301">
Books, of the tragic kind. The re|mor&s;e and contrition of the guilty pair, and their lamentations over Paradi&s;e, when they are obliged to leave it, are very moving. The la&s;t Epi&s;ode of the Angel's &s;howing Adam the fate of his po&s;terity, is happily imagined; but, in many places, the execution is languid.</P>
<P>MILTON'S language and ver&s;ification have high merit. His &s;tyle is full of maje&s;ty, and wonderfully adapted to his &s;ubject. His blank ver&s;e is harmonious and diver&s;ified, and affords the mo&s;t complete example of the elevation, which our language is capable of attaining by the force of numbers. It does not flow like the French ver&s;e, in tame, re|gular, uniform melody, which &s;oon tires the ear; but is &s;ometimes &s;mooth and flowing, &s;ometimes rough; varied in its cadence, and intermixed with di&s;cords, &s;o as to &s;uit the &s;trength and freedom of Epic Compo&s;ition. Neglected and pro&s;aic lines, indeed, we &s;ometimes meet with; but, in a work &s;o long, and in the main &s;o harmonious, the&s;e may be forgiven.</P>
<P>ON the whole; Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is a Poem that abounds with beauties of every kind, and that ju&s;tly entitles its Author to a degree of fame not inferior to any Poet; though it mu&s;t be al&s;o admitted to have many in|equalities. It is the lot of almo&s;t every high and daring genius, not to be uniform and
<PB N="299" REF="302">
correct. Milton is too frequently theological and metaphy&s;ical; &s;ometimes har&s;h in his language; often too technical in his words, and affectedly o&s;tentatious of his learn+ing. Many of his faults mu&s;t be attributed to the pedantry of the age in which he lived. He di&s;covers a vigour, a gra&s;p of genius equal to every thing that is great; &s;ometimes he ri&s;es above every Poet, at other times he falls much below him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XLV. DRAMATIC POETRY&mdash;TRAGEDY.</HEAD>
<P>DRAMATIC Poetry has, among all civilized nations, been con&s;idered as a rational and u&s;eful entertainment, and judged worthy of careful and &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Ac|cording as it is employed upon the light and the gay, or upon the grave and affecting in|cidents of human life, it divides it&s;elf into the two forms, of Comedy or Tragedy. But as great and &s;erious objects command more attention than little and ludicrous ones; as the fall of a Hero intere&s;ts the public more than the marriage of a private per&s;on; Tra|gedy has been always held a more dignified entertainment than Comedy. The one re&s;ts upon the high pa&s;&s;ions, the virtues, crimes, and &s;ufferings of mankind. The other on their humours, follies, and plea&s;ures. Terror
<PB N="301" REF="304">
and pity are the great in&s;truments of the former; ridicule is the &s;ole in&s;trument of the latter. Tragedy &s;hall therefore be the object of our fulle&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. This and the fol|lowing Lecture &s;hall be employed on it; after which I &s;hall treat of what is peculiar to Comedy.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, con&s;idered as an exhibition of the characters and behaviour of men, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t trying and critical &s;ituations of life, is a noble idea of Poetry. It is a direct imitation of human manners and actions. For it does not, like the Epic Poem, exhibit characters by the narration and de&s;cription of the Poet; but the Poet di&s;appears; and the per&s;onages them&s;elves are &s;et before us, acting and &s;peaking what is &s;uitable to their cha|racters. Hence, no kind of writing is &s;o great a trial of the Author's profound know|ledge of the human heart. No kind of writing has &s;o much power, when happily executed, to rai&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t emotions. It is, or ought to be, a mirror in which we be|hold our&s;elves, and the evils to which we are expo&s;ed; a faithful copy of the human pa&s;&s;ions, with all their direful effects, when they are &s;uffered to become extravagant.</P>
<P>AS Tragedy is a high and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;pecies of Compo&s;ition, &s;o al&s;o, in its general &s;train and &s;pirit, it is favourable to virtue. Such power hath virtue happily over the hu|man mind, by the wi&s;e and gracious con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="302" REF="305">
of our nature, that as admiration cannot be rai&s;ed in Epic Poetry, &s;o neither in Tragic Poetry can our pa&s;&s;ions be &s;trongly moved, unle&s;s virtuous emotions be awaken|ed within us. Every Poet finds, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to intere&s;t us in any character, without repre&s;enting that character as worthy and honourable, though it may not be per|fect; and that the great great &s;ecret for rai&s;ing indignation, is to paint the per&s;on who is to be the object of it, in the colours of vice and depravity. He may, indeed, nay, he mu&s;t, repre&s;ent the virtuous as &s;ometimes unfortunate, becau&s;e this is often the ca&s;e in real life; but he will always &s;tudy to engage our hearts in their behalf; and though they may be de&s;cribed as unpro&s;perous, yet there is no in&s;tance of a Tragic Poet repre&s;enting vice as fully triumphant, and happy, in the cata&s;trophe of the Piece. Even when bad men &s;ucceed in their de&s;igns, puni&s;hment is made always to attend them; and mi&s;ery of one kind or other, is &s;hown to be unavoid|ably connected with guilt. Love and admi|ration of virtuous characters, compa&s;&s;ion for the injured and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and indignation again&s;t the Authors of their &s;ufferings, are the &s;entiments mo&s;t generally excited by Tragedy. And, therefore, though Dramatic Writers may &s;ometimes, like other Writers, be guilty of improprieties, though they may fail of placing virtue preci&s;ely in the due point of light, yet no rea&s;onable per&s;on can refu&s;e Tragedy to be a moral &s;pecies of compo&s;ition.
<PB N="303" REF="306">
Taking Tragedies complexly, I am fully per&s;uaded, that the impre&s;&s;ions left by them upon the mind, are, on the whole, favour|able to virtue and good di&s;po&s;itions. And, therefore, the zeal which &s;ome pious men have &s;hown again&s;t the entertainments of the Theatre, mu&s;t re&s;t only upon the abu&s;e of Comedy; which, indeed, has frequently been &s;o great as to ju&s;tify very &s;evere cen&s;ures again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE account which Ari&s;totle gives of the de&s;ign of Tragedy, is, that it is intended to purge our pa&s;&s;ions by means of pity and ter|ror. This is &s;omewhat ob&s;cure. Various &s;en&s;es have been put upon his words, and much altercation has followed among his commentators. Without entering into any controver&s;y upon this head, the intention of Tragedy may, I think, be more &s;hortly and clearly defined, To improve our virtuous &s;en|&s;ibility. If an Author intere&s;ts us in behalf of virtue, forms us to compa&s;&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in&s;pires us with proper &s;entiments, on beholding the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, and, by means of the concern which he rai&s;es for the misfortunes of others, leads us to guard again&s;t errors in our own conduct, he accompli&s;hes all the moral purpo&s;es of Tragedy.</P>
<P>IN order to this end, the fir&s;t requi&s;ite is, that he pitch upon &s;ome moving and intere&s;t|ing &s;tory, and that he conduct it in a natural and probable manner. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
<PB N="304" REF="307">
that the natural and the probable mu&s;t always be the ba&s;is of Tragedy; and are infinitely more e&s;&s;ential there, than in Epic Poetry. The object of the Epic Poet, is to excite our admiration by the recital of heroic adven|tures; and a much &s;lighter degree of proba|bility is required when admiration is con|cerned, than when the tender pa&s;&s;ions are intended to be moved. The imagination, in the former ca&s;e, is exalted, accommodates it&s;elf to the Poet's idea, and can admit the marvellous, without being &s;hocked. But Tragedy demands a &s;tricter imitation of the life and actions of men. For the end which it pur&s;ues is, not &s;o much to elevate the imagination, as to affect the heart; and the heart always judges more nicely than the imagination, of what is probable. Pa&s;&s;ion can be rai&s;ed, only by making the impre&s;&s;ions of nature, and of truth, upon the mind. By introducing, therefore, any wild or romantic circum&s;tances into his Story, the Poet never fails to check pa&s;&s;ion in its growth, and of cour&s;e, di&s;appoints the main effect of Tra|gedy.</P>
<P>THIS principle, which is founded on the cleare&s;t rea&s;on, excludes from Tragedy all machinery, or fabulous intervention of the Gods. Gho&s;ts have, indeed, maintained their place; as being &s;trongly founded on popular belief, and peculiarly &s;uited to heighten the terror of Tragic Scenes. But all unravellings of the Plot, which turn
<PB N="305" REF="308">
upon the interpo&s;ition of Deities, &s;uch as Euripides employs in &s;everal of his plays, are much to be condemned; both as clum&s;y and inartificial, and as de&s;troying the proba|bility of the Story. This mixture of machi|nery, with the Tragic Action, is undoubtedly a blemi&s;h in the Ancient Theatre.</P>
<P>IN order to promote that impre&s;&s;ion of pro|bability which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of Tragedy, &s;ome Critics have required, that the &s;ubject &s;hould never be a pure fiction invented by the Poet, but built on real hi&s;|tory or known facts. Such, indeed, were generally, if not always, the &s;ubjects of the Greek Tragedians. But I cannot hold this to be a matter of any great con&s;equence. It is proved by experience, that a fictitious tale, if properly conducted, will melt the heart as much as any real hi&s;tory. In order to our being moved, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the events related did actually happen, provided they be &s;uch, as might ea&s;ily have happened in the ordinary cour&s;e of nature. Even when Tragedy borrows its materials from Hi&s;tory, it mixes many a fictitious circum&s;tance. The greate&s;t part of Readers neither know, nor en|quire, what is fabulous or what is hi&s;torical, in the &s;ubject. They attend only to what is pro|bable, and are touched by events which re|&s;emble nature. Accordingly, &s;ome of the mo&s;t pathetic Tragedies are entirely fictitious in the &s;ubject; &s;uch as Voltaire's Zaire and Alzire, the Orphan, Douglas, the Fair Penitent, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="309">
WHETHER the &s;ubject be of the real or feigned kind, that on which mo&s;t depends for rendering the incidents in a Tragedy pro|bable, and, by means of their probability affecting, is the conduct, or management of the Story, and the connection of its &s;everal parts. To regulate this conduct. Critics have laid down the famous rule of the three Uni|ties; the importance of which, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s. But, in order to do this with more advantage, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, that we fir&s;t look backwards, and trace the ri&s;e and origin of Tragedy, which will give light to &s;everal things relating to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, like other arts, was, in its beginning&s;, rude and imperfect. Among the Greeks, from whom our Dramatic Enter|tainments are derived, the origin of Tragedy was no other than the Song which was wont to be &s;ung at the fe&s;tival of Bacchus. A goat was the &s;acrifice offered to that God; after the &s;acrifice, the prie&s;ts, with the company that joined them, &s;ung hymns in honour of Bacchus; and from the name of the victim, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a Goat, joined with <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a Song, un|doubtedly aro&s;e the word, Tragedy.</P>
<P>THESE Hymns, or Lyric Poems, were &s;ung &s;ometimes by the whole company, &s;ome|times by &s;eparate bands, an&s;wering alternately to each other; making what we call a Cho|rus, with its Strophes and Anti&s;trophes. In order to throw &s;ome variety into this enter|tainment, and to relieve the Singers, it was
<PB N="307" REF="310">
thought proper to introduce a per&s;on who, between the &s;ongs, &s;hould make a recitation in Ver&s;e. The&s;pis, who lived about 536 years before the Chri&s;tian aera, made this in|novation; and, as it was reli&s;hed, Ae&s;chylus, who came 50 years after him, and who is properly the father of Tragedy, went a &s;tep farther, introduced a Dialogue between two per&s;ons, or actors, in which he contrived to interweave &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;tory, and brought his actors on a Stage, adorned with proper &s;cenery and decorations. All that the&s;e ac|tors recited, was called Epi&s;ode, or additional Song; and the Songs of the Chorus were made to relate no longer to Bacchus, their original &s;ubject, but to the Story in which the Actors were concerned. This began to give the Drama a regular form, which was &s;oon after brought to perfection, by Sophocles and Eu|ripides. It is remarkable, in how &s;hort a &s;pace of time Tragedy grew up among the Greeks, from the rude&s;t beginnings to its mo&s;t perfect &s;tate. For Sophocles, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t correct of all the Tragic Poets, flouri&s;hed only 22 years after Ae&s;chylus, and was little more than 70 years po&s;terior to The&s;pis.</P>
<P>FROM the account which I have now given, it appears, that the Chorus was the ba&s;is or foundation of the ancient Tragedy. It was not an ornament added to it; or a contri|vance de&s;igned to render it more perfect; but, in truth, the Dramatic Dialogue was an
<PB N="308" REF="311">
addition to the Chorus, which was the origi|nal entertainment. In proce&s;s of time, the Chorus, from being the principal, became only the acce&s;&s;ary in Tragedy; till at la&s;t, in Modern Tragedy, it has di&s;appeared altogether; which forms the chief di&s;tinc|tion between the Ancient and the Modern Stage.</P>
<P>THIS has given ri&s;e to a que&s;tion, much agitated between the partizans of the An|cients and the Moderns, whether the Drama has gained, or has &s;uffered, by the abolition of the Chorus. It mu&s;t be admitted, that the Chorus tended to render Tragedy both more magnificent, and more in&s;tructive and moral. It was always the mo&s;t Sublime and Poetical part of the Work; and being carried on by &s;inging, and accompanied with Mu&s;ic, it mu&s;t, no doubt, have diver&s;ified the Enter|tainment greatly, and added to its &s;plendour. The Chorus, at the &s;ame time, conveyed con&s;tant le&s;&s;ons of Virtue. It was compo&s;ed of &s;uch per&s;ons as might mo&s;t naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion; inhabitants of the place where the &s;cene was laid, often the companions of &s;ome of the principal ac|tors, and, therefore, in &s;ome degree intere&s;ted in the i&s;&s;ue of the action. This company, which, in the days of Sophocles, was re|&s;tricted to the number of fifteen per&s;ons, was con&s;tantly on the Stage, during the whole performance, mingled in di&s;cour&s;e with the actors, entered into their concerns, &s;ugge&s;ted

coun&s;el and advice to them, morali&s;ed on all the incidents that were going on, and, during the intervals of the action, &s;ung their Odes, or Songs, in which they addre&s;&s;ed the Gods, prayed for &s;ucce&s;s to the virtuous, lamented their misfortunes, and delivered many reli|gious and moral &s;entiments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The office of the Chorus is thus de&s;cribed by Horace:

<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding the advantages which were obtained by means of the Chorus, the inconveniencies on the other &s;ide are &s;o great, as to render the modern practice of excluding the Chorus, far more eligible upon the whole.
<PB N="310" REF="313">
For if a natural and probable imitation of human actions be the chief end of the Drama, no other per&s;ons ought to be brought on the Stage, than tho&s;e who are nece&s;&s;ary to the Dramatic action. The introduction of an adventitious company of per&s;ons, who have but a &s;light concern in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the play, is unnatural in it&s;elf, embarra&s;&s;ing to the Poet, and, though it may render the &s;pectacle &s;plendid, tends, undoubtedly, to render it more cold and unintere&s;ting, becau&s;e more unlike a real tran&s;action. The mixture of Mu&s;ic, or Song, on the part of the Cho|rus, with the Dialogue carried on by the Actors, is another unnatural circum&s;tance, removing the repre&s;entation &s;till farther from the re&s;emblance of life. The Poet, be&s;ides, is &s;ubjected to innumerable difficulties, in &s;o contriving his plan, that the pre&s;ence of the Chorus, during all the incidents of the Play, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t with any probability. The &s;cene mu&s;t be con&s;tantly, and often ab&s;urdly, laid in &s;ome public place, that the Chorus may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have free acce&s;s to it. To many things that ought to be tran&s;acted in private, the Chorus mu&s;t ever be witne&s;&s;es; they mu&s;t be the confederates of both par|ties, who come &s;ucce&s;&s;ively upon the Stage, and who are, perhaps, con&s;piring again&s;t each other. In &s;hort, the management of a Chorus is an unnatural confinement to a Poet; it requires too great a &s;acrifice of pro|bability in the conduct of the action; it has too much the air of a theatrical decoration,
<PB N="311" REF="314">
to be con&s;i&s;tent with that appearance of rea|lity, which a Poet mu&s;t ever pre&s;erve in in order to move our pa&s;&s;ions. The origin of Tragedy, among the Greeks, we have &s;een, was a choral Song, or Hymn, to the Gods. There is no wonder, therefore, that on the Greek Stage it &s;o long maintained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But it may confidently, I think, be a&s;&s;erted, that if, in&s;tead of the Dramatic Dialogue having been &s;uperadded to the Cho|rus, the Dialogue it&s;elf had been the fir&s;t in|vention, the Chorus would, in that ca&s;e, never have been thought of.</P>
<P>ONE u&s;e, I am of opinion, might &s;till be made of the Ancient Chorus, and would be a con&s;iderable improvement of the Modern Theatre; if, in&s;tead of that unmeaning, and often improperly cho&s;en Mu&s;ic, with which the Audience is entertained in the intervals between the acts, a Chorus were then to be introduced, who&s;e Mu&s;ic and Songs, though forming no part of the Play, &s;hould have a relation to the incidents of the preceding act, and to the di&s;po&s;itions which tho&s;e inci|dents are pre&s;umed to have awakened in the Spectators. By this means, the tone of pa&s;|&s;ion would be kept up without interruption; and all the good effects of the antient Chorus might be pre&s;erved, for in&s;piring proper &s;en|timents, and for increa&s;ing the morality of the performance, without tho&s;e inconvenien|ces which aro&s;e from the Chorus forming a con&s;tituent part of the Play, and mingling
<PB N="312" REF="315">
un&s;ea&s;onably, and unnaturally, with the per|&s;onages of the Drama.</P>
<P>AFTER the view which we have taken of the ri&s;e of Tragedy, and of the nature of the Ancient Chorus, with the advantages and inconveniences attending it, our way is clear|ed for examining, with more advantage, the three Unities of Action, Place, and Time, which have generally been con&s;idered as e&s;|&s;ential to the proper conduct of the Dramatic Fable.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e three, the fir&s;t, Unity of Action, is, beyond doubt, far the mo&s;t important. In treating of Epic Poetry, I have already explained the nature of it; as con&s;i&s;ting in a relation which all the incidents introduced bear to &s;ome de&s;ign or effect, &s;o as to com|bine naturally into one whole. This unity of &s;ubject is &s;till more e&s;&s;ential to Tragedy, than it is to Epic Poetry. For a multiplicity of Plots, or Actions, crowded into &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace as Tragedy allows, mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, di&s;tract the attention, and prevent pa&s;&s;ion from rai&s;ing to any height. Nothing there|fore, is wor&s;e conduct in a Tragic Poet, than to carry on two independent actions in the &s;ame Play; the effect of which, is, that the mind being &s;u&s;pended and divided between them, cannot give it&s;elf up entirely either to the one, or the other. There may, indeed, be under-plots; that is, the per&s;ons introdu|ced, may have different pur&s;uits and de&s;igns;
<PB N="313" REF="316">
but the Poet's art mu&s;t be &s;hown in manag|ing the&s;e, &s;o as to render them &s;ub&s;ervient to the main action. They ought to be con|nected with the cata&s;trophe of the Play, and to con&s;pire in bringing it forward. If there be any intrigue which &s;tands &s;eparate and in|dependent, and which may be left out with|out affecting the unravelling of the Plot, we may always conclude this to be a faulty viola|tion of Unity. Such Epi&s;odes are not per|mitted here, as in Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>WE have a clear example of this defect in Mr. Addi&s;on's Cato. The &s;ubject of this Tra|gedy is, the death of Cato; and a very noble per&s;onage Cato is, and &s;upported by the Au|thor with much dignity. But all the love &s;cenes in the Play; the pa&s;&s;ion of Cato's two &s;ons for Lucia, and that of Juba for Cato's daughter, are mere Epi&s;odes; have no connection with the principal action, and no effect upon it. The Author thought his &s;ub|ject too barren in incidents, and in order to diver&s;ify it, he has given us, as it were, by the bye, a hi&s;tory of the amours that were going on in Cato's family; by which he hath both broken the Unity of his &s;ubject, and formed a very un&s;ea&s;onable junction of gal|lantry, with the high &s;entiments, and public &s;pirited pa&s;&s;ions which predominate in other parts, and which the Play was chiefly de&s;ign|ed to di&s;play.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="317">
WE mu&s;t take care not to confound the Unity of the Action with the Simplicity of the Plot. Unity and Simplicity, import dif|ferent things in Dramatic Compo&s;ition. The Plot is &s;aid to be Simple, when a &s;mall num|ber of incidents are introduced into it. But it may be implex, as the Critics term it, that is, it may include a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons and events, and yet not be deficient in Unity; provided all the incidents be made to tend towards the principal object of the Play, and be properly connected with it. All the Greek Tragedies not only maintain Unity in the Action, but are remarkably Simple in the Plot; to &s;uch a degree, indeed, as &s;ometimes to appear to us too naked, and de&s;titute of intere&s;ting events. In the OEdi|pus Coloneus, for in&s;tance, of Sophocles, the whole &s;ubject is no more than this: OEdipus, blind and mi&s;erable, wanders to Athens, and wi&s;hes to dye there; Creon, and his &s;on Polynices, arrive at the &s;ame time, and en|deavour, &s;eparately, to per&s;uade the old man to return to Thebes, each with a view to his own intere&s;t; he will not go; The&s;eus, the king of Athens, protects him; and the play ends with his death. In the Philoctetes of the &s;ame Author, the Plot, or Fable, is no|thing more than Uly&s;&s;es, and the &s;on of Achilles, &s;tudying to per&s;uade the di&s;ea&s;ed Philoctetes to leave his uninhabited i&s;land, and go with them to Troy; which he refu&s;es to do, till Hercules, who&s;e arrows he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed, de&s;cends from Heaven and commands
<PB N="315" REF="318">
him. Yet the&s;e &s;imple, and &s;eemingly bar|ren &s;ubjects, are wrought up with &s;o much art by Sophocles, as to become very tender and affecting.</P>
<P>AMONG the Moderns, much greater va|riety of events has been admitted into Tra|gedy. It has become more the theatre of pa&s;&s;ion than it was among the Ancients. A greater di&s;play of characters is attempted; more intrigue and action are carried on; our curio&s;ity is more awakened, and more inte|re&s;ting &s;ituations ari&s;e. This variety is, upon the whole, an improvement on Tragedy; it renders the entertainment both more animat|ed, and more in&s;tructive; and when kept within due bounds, may be perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent with unity of &s;ubject. But the Poet mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, beware of not deviat|ing too far from Simplicity, in the con&s;tructi|on of his Fable. For if he over-charges it with Action and Intrigue, it becomes perplex|ed and embarra&s;&s;ed; and, by con&s;equence, lo&s;es much of its effect. Congreve's "Mourn|ing Bride," a Tragedy, otherwi&s;e far from being void of merit, fails in this re&s;pect; and may be given as an in&s;tance of one &s;tand|ing in perfect oppo&s;ition to the &s;implicity of the ancient Plots. The incidents &s;ucceed one another too rapidly. The Play is too full of bu&s;ine&s;s. It is difficult for the mind to fol|low and comprehend the whole &s;eries of events; and, what is the greate&s;t fault of all, the cata&s;trophe, which ought always to be
<PB N="316" REF="319">
plain and &s;imple, is brought about in a man|ner too artificial and intricate.</P>
<P>UNITY of Action mu&s;t not only be &s;tu|died in the general con&s;truction of the Fable, or Plot, but mu&s;t regulate the &s;everal acts and &s;cenes, into which the Play is divided.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion of every Play, into Five Acts, has no other foundation than common prac|tice, and the authority of Horace:
<Q><L>Neve minor, neu &s;it quinto productior actu</L>
<L>Fabula.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>DE ARTE POET.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q><L>If you would have your Play de&s;erve &s;ucce&s;s,</L>

It is a divi&s;ion purely arbitrary. There is nothing in the nature of the Compo&s;ition which fixes this number rather than any other; and it had been much better if no &s;uch number had been a&s;certained, but every Play had been allowed to divide it&s;elf into as many parts, or intervals, as the &s;ubject na|turally pointed out. On the Greek Stage, whatever may have been the ca&s;e on the Ro|man, the divi&s;ion by Acts was totally un|known. The word, Act, never once occurs in Ari&s;totle's Poetics, in which he defines ex|actly every part of the Drama, and divides it into the beginning, the middle, and the end; or, in his own words, into the Pro|logue, the Epi&s;ode, and the Exode. The
<PB N="317" REF="320">
Greek Tragedy was, indeed, one continued repre&s;entation, from beginning to end. The Stage was never empty, nor the curtain let fall. But, at certain intervals, when the Actors retired, the Chorus continued and &s;ung. Neither do the&s;e Songs of the Cho|rus divide the Greek Tragedies into five portions, &s;imiliar to our acts; though &s;ome of the Commentators have endeavoured to force them into this office. But it is plain, that the intervals at which the Chorus &s;ung, are extremely unequal and irregular, &s;uited to the occa&s;ion and the &s;ubject; and would divide the Play &s;ometimes into three, &s;ome|times into &s;even or eight acts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the Di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to Franklin's Tran&s;lation of Sophocles.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS practice has now e&s;tabli&s;hed a different plan on the Modern Stage, has divided every Play into Five Acts, and made a total pau&s;e in the repre&s;entation at the end of each Act, the Poet mu&s;t be careful that this Pau&s;e &s;hall fall in a proper place; where there is a natu|ral pau&s;e in the Action; and where, if the imagination has any thing to &s;upply, that is not repre&s;ented on the Stage, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed to have been tran&s;acted during the in|terval.</P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t Act ought to contain a clear ex|po&s;ition of the &s;ubject. It ought to be &s;o managed as to awaken the curio&s;ity of the

It &s;hould make them acquainted with the per&s;onages who are to appear, with their &s;everal views and intere&s;t, and with the &s;itu|ation of affairs at the time when the Play commences. A &s;triking introduction, &s;uch as the fir&s;t &s;peech of Almeria, in the Mourn|ing Bride, and that of Lady Randolph, in Douglas, produces a happy effect; but this is what the &s;ubject will not always admit. In the ruder times of Dramatic Writing, the ex|po&s;ition of the &s;ubject was wont to be made by a Prologue, or by a &s;ingle Actor appear|ing, and giving full and direct information to the Spectators. Some of Ae&s;chylus's and Euripides's Plays are opened inthis manner. But &s;uch an introduction is extremely in|artificial, and, therefore, is now totally abo|li&s;hed, and the &s;ubject made to open it&s;elf by conver&s;ation, among the fir&s;t Actors who are brought upon the Stage.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of the Drama, in the Second, Third, and Fourth Acts, the Plot &s;hould gradually thick. The great object which the Poet ought here to have in view, is, by intere&s;ting us in his Story, to keep our pa&s;&s;ions always awake. As &s;oon as he allows us to langui&s;h, there is no more Tragic merit. He &s;hould, therefore, in|troduce no per&s;onages but &s;uch as are nece&s;|&s;ary for carrying on the action. He &s;hould
<PB N="319" REF="322">
contrive to place tho&s;e, whom he finds it proper to introduce, in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ituations. He &s;hould have no &s;cenes of idle conver&s;ation, or mere declamation. The ac|tion of the Play ought to be always advancing; and as it advances, the &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and the concern of the Spectators, to be rai&s;ed more and more. This is the great excellency of Shake&s;peare, that his &s;cenes are full of &s;enti|ment and Action, never of mere di&s;cour&s;e; whereas, it is often a fault of the be&s;t French Tragedians, that they allow the Action to langui&s;h, for the &s;ake of a long and artful Dialogue. Sentiment, Pa&s;&s;ion, Pity, and Terror, &s;hould reign throughout a Tragedy. Every thing &s;hould be full of movements. An u&s;ele&s;s incident, or an unnece&s;&s;ary con|ver&s;ation, weaken the intere&s;t which we take in the Action, and render us cold and inat|tentive.</P>
<P>THE Fifth Act is, the &s;eat of the cata&s;tro|phe, or the unravelling of the Plot, in which we always expect the art and genius of the Poet to be mo&s;t fully di&s;played. The fir&s;t Rule concerning it, is, that it be brought about by probable and natural means. Hence all unravellings which turn upon di&s;gui&s;ed habits, rencounters by night, mi&s;takes of one per&s;on for another, and other &s;uch Theatrical and Romantic circum&s;tances, are to be con|demned as faulty. In the next place, the Cata&s;trophe ought always to be &s;imple; to
<PB N="320" REF="323">
depend on few events, and to include but few per&s;ons. Pa&s;&s;ion never ri&s;es &s;o high when it is divided among many objects, as when it is directed towards one, or a few. And it is &s;till more checked, if the incidents be &s;o complex and intricate, that the under|&s;tanding is put on the &s;tretch to trace them, when the heart &s;hould be wholly delivered up to emotion. The cata&s;trophe of the Mourn|ing Bride, as I formerly hinted, offends again&s;t both the&s;e rules. In the la&s;t place, the ca|ta&s;trophe of a Tragedy ought to be the reign of pure &s;entiment and pa&s;&s;ion. In proportion as it approaches, every thing &s;hould warm and glow. No long di&s;cour&s;es; no cold rea|&s;onings; no parade of genius, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e &s;olemn and awful events, that clo&s;e &s;ome of the great Revolutions of human for|tune. There, if any where, the Poet mu&s;t be &s;imple, &s;erious, pathetic; and &s;peak no language but that of nature.</P>
<P>THE Ancients were fond of unravellings, which turned upon what is called, an <Q REND="inline">"Anagnori&s;is,"</Q> or, a di&s;covery of &s;ome per|&s;on to be different from what he was taken to be. When &s;uch di&s;coveries are artfully conducted, and produced in critical &s;ituations, they are extremely &s;triking; &s;uch as that fa|mous one in Sophocles, which makes the whole &s;ubject of his OEdipus Tyrannus, and which is, undoubtedly, the fulle&s;t of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, agitation, and terror, that ever was exhibited
<PB N="321" REF="324">
on any Stage. Among the Moderns, two of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Anagnori&s;es, are tho&s;e contained in Voltaire's Merope, and Mr. Home's Douglas: both of which, are great ma&s;ter-pieces of the kind.</P>
<P>IT is not e&s;&s;ential to the Cata&s;trophe of a Tragedy, that it &s;hould end unhappily. In the cour&s;e of the Play, there may be &s;uffici|ent agitation and di&s;tre&s;s, and many tender emotions rai&s;ed by the &s;ufferings and dangers of the virtuous, though, in the end, good men are rendered &s;ucce&s;sful. The Tragic Spirit, therefore, does not want &s;cope upon this &s;y&s;tem; and, accordingly, the Athalie of Racine, and &s;ome of Voltaire's fine&s;t Plays, &s;uch as Abzire, Merope, and the Orphan of China, with &s;ome few Engli&s;h Tragedies likewi&s;e, have a fortunate conclu&s;ion. But, in general, the &s;pirit of Tragedy, e&s;pecially of Engli&s;h Tragedy, leans more to the &s;ide of leaving the impre&s;&s;ion of virtuous &s;orrow full and &s;trong upon the heart.</P>
<P>A QUESTION, intimately connected with this &s;ubject, and which has employed the &s;peculations of &s;everal Philo&s;ophical Critics, naturally occurs here; How it comes to pa&s;s that tho&s;e emotions of &s;orrow which Tragedy excites, afford any gratification to the mind? For, is not &s;orrow, in its nature, a painful pa&s;&s;ion? Is not real di&s;tre&s;s often occa&s;ioned to the Spectators, by the Dramatic repre&s;en|tations at which they a&s;&s;i&s;t? Do we not &s;ee
<PB N="322" REF="325">
their tears flow? and yet, while the impre&s;&s;ion of what they have &s;uffered remains upon their minds, they again a&s;&s;emble in crowds, to renew the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The que&s;tion is not without difficulty, and various &s;olutions of it have been propo&s;ed by ingenious men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Dr. Campbell's Philo&s;ophy of Rhetorie, Book I. ch. xi. where an account is given of the hypothe&s;es of dif|ferent Critics on this &s;ubject; and where one is propo&s;ed, with which, in the main, I agree.&mdash;See al&s;o Lord Kaimes's E&s;&s;ays on the Principles of Morality. E&s;&s;ay I. And Mr. David Hume's E&s;&s;ay on Tragedy.</NOTE>. The mo&s;t plain and &s;atisfactory account of the matter, appears to me to be the following. By the wife and gracious con&s;titution of our nature, the exerci&s;e of all the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions is attended with plea&s;ure. Nothing is more plea&s;ing and grateful, than love and friend|&s;hip. Wherever man takes a &s;trong intere&s;t in the concerns of his fellow-creatures, an internal &s;atisfaction is made to accompany the feeling. Pity, or compa&s;&s;ion, in parti|cular, is, for wi&s;e ends, appointed to be one of the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tincts of our frame, and is attended with a peculiar attractive power. It is an affection which cannot but be produc|tive of &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, on account of the &s;ym|pathy with the &s;ufferers, which it nece&s;&s;arily involves. But, as it includes benevolence and friend&s;hip, it partakes, at the &s;ame time, of the agreeable and plea&s;ing nature of tho&s;e affections. The heart is warmed by kindne&s;s and humanity, at the &s;ame moment at which it is afflicted by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e with
<PB N="323" REF="326">
whom it &s;ympathi&s;es: and the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from tho&s;e kind emotions, prevails &s;o much in the mixture, and &s;o far counterbalances the pain, as to render the &s;tate of the mind, upon the whole, agreeable. At the &s;ame time, the immediate plea&s;ure, which always goes along with the operation of the benevolent and &s;ympathetic affections, derives an addition from the approbation of our own minds. We are plea&s;ed with our&s;elves, for feeling as we ought, and for entering, with proper &s;orrow, into the concerns of the afflicted. In Trage|dy, be&s;ides, other adventitious circum&s;tances concur to dimini&s;h the painful part of Sym|pathy, and to increa&s;e the &s;atisfaction attend|ing it. We are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relieved, by thinking that the cau&s;e of our di&s;tre&s;s is feigned, not real; and we are al&s;o gratified by the charms of Poetry, the propriety of Sentiment and Language, and the beauty of Action. From the concurrence of the&s;e cau&s;es, the plea&s;ure which we receive from Tragedy, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tre&s;s it occa|&s;ions, &s;eems to me to be accounted for, in a &s;atisfactory manner. At the &s;ame time, it is to be ob&s;erved, that, as there is always a mixture of pain in the plea&s;ure, that pain is capable of being &s;o much heightened, by the repre&s;entation of incidents extremely direful, as to &s;hock our feelings, and to render us aver&s;e, either to the reading of &s;uch Trage|dies, or to the beholding of them upon the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="327">
HAVING now &s;poken of the conduct of the &s;ubject throughout the Acts, it is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of the conduct of the &s;everal &s;cenes which make up the Acts of a Play.</P>
<P>THE entrance of a new per&s;onage upon the Stage, forms, what is called, a New Scene. The&s;e &s;cenes, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conver&s;a|tions, &s;hould be clo&s;ely linked and connected with each other; and much of the Art of Dramatic Compo&s;ition is &s;hown in maintain|ing this connection. Two rules are nece&s;|&s;ary to be ob&s;erved for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that, during the cour&s;e of one Act, the Stage &s;hould never be left vacant, though but for a &s;ingle moment; that is, all the per&s;ons who have appeared in one &s;cene, or conver&s;ation, &s;hould never go off together, and be &s;ucceeded by a new &s;et of per&s;ons ap|pearing in the next Scene, independent of the former. This makes a gap, or total interrupti|on in the repre&s;entation, which, in effect puts an end to that Act. For, wherever the Stage is evacuated, the Act is clo&s;ed. This rule is, very generally, ob&s;erved by the French Tragedians; but the Engli&s;h Writers, both of Comedy and Tragedy, &s;eldom pay any regard to it. Their Per&s;onages &s;ucceed one another upon the Stage with &s;o little connection; the union of their Scenes is &s;o much broken, that, with equal propriety, their Plays might be divided into ten or twelve Acts, as into five.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="328">
THE &s;econd rule, which the Engli&s;h Wri|ters al&s;o ob&s;erve little better than the former, is, that no per&s;on &s;hould come upon the Stage, or leave it, without a rea&s;on appear|ing to us, both for the one and the other. Nothing is more aukward, and contrary to art, than for an Actor to enter, without our &s;eeing any cau&s;e for his appearing in that Scene, except that it was for the Poet's pur|po&s;e he &s;hould enter preci&s;ely at &s;uch a mo|ment; or for an Actor to go away, without any rea&s;on for his retiring, farther than that the Poet had no more &s;peeches to put into his his mouth. This is managing the Per&s;onae Dramatis exactly like &s;o many puppets, who are moved by wires, to an&s;wer the call of the ma&s;ter of the &s;how. Whereas the perfection of Dramatic Writing requires that every thing &s;hould be conducted in imitation, as near as po&s;&s;ible, of &s;ome real tran&s;action; where we are let into the &s;ecret of all that is pa&s;&s;ing, where we behold per&s;ons before us always bu&s;y; &s;ee them coming and going; and know perfectly whence they come, and whither they go, and about what they are employed.</P>
<P>ALL that I have hitherto &s;aid, relates to the Unity of the Dramatic Action. In order to render the Unity of Action more complete, Critics have added the other two unities of Time and Place. The &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the&s;e is more difficult, and, perhaps, not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. The Unity of Place requires, that
<PB N="326" REF="329">
the Scene &s;hould never be &s;hifted; but that the Action of the Play &s;hould be continued to the end, in the &s;ame place where it is &s;up|po&s;ed to begin. The Unity of Time, &s;trictly taken, requires, that the time of the Action be no longer than the time that is allowed for the Repre&s;entation of the play; though Ari&s;totle &s;eems to have given the Poet a little more liberty, and permitted the Ac|tion to comprehend the whole time of one day.</P>
<P>THE intention of both the&s;e rules is, to overcharge as little as po&s;&s;ible, the imagi|nation of the Spectators with improbable circum&s;tances in the acting of the Play, and to bring the imitation more clo&s;e to reality. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the nature of Dra|matic Exhibitions upon the Greek Stage, &s;ubjected the Ancient Tragedians to a more &s;trict ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e Unities than is nece&s;&s;ary in Modern Theatres. I &s;howed, that a Greek Tragedy was one uninter|rupted repre&s;entation, from beginning to end. There was no divi&s;ion of Acts; no pau&s;es or interval between them; but the Stage was continually full; occupied either by the Actors, or the Chorus. Hence, no room was left for the imagination to go be|yond the preci&s;e time and place of the repre&s;entation; any more than is allowed during the continuance of one Act, on the Modern Theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="330">
BUT the practi&s;e of &s;u&s;pending the &s;pec|tacle totally for &s;ome little time between the Acts, has made a great and material change; gives more latitude to the imagination, and renders the ancient &s;trict confinement to time and place le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. While the acting of the Play is interrupted, the Spectator can, without any great or violent effort, &s;uppo&s;e a few hours to pa&s;s between every Act; or can &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf moved from one apart|ment of a palace, or one part of a city to another; and, therefore, too &s;trict an ob&s;er|vance of the&s;e Unities, ought not to be pre|ferred to higher beauties of execution, nor to the introduction of more pathetic &s;ituati|ons, which &s;ometimes cannot be accompli&s;hed in any other way, than by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e rules.</P>
<P>ON the Ancient Stage, we plainly &s;ee the Poets &s;truggling with many an inconveni|ence, in order to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Unities which were then &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. As the Scene could never be &s;hifted, they were obliged to make it always lie in &s;ome court of a palace, or &s;ome public area, to which all the per&s;ons concerned in the action might have equal ac|ce&s;s. This led to frequent improbabilities, by repre&s;enting things as tran&s;acted there, which naturally ought to have been tran&s;acted before few witne&s;&s;es, and in private apart|ments. The like improbabilities aro&s;e, from limiting them&s;elves &s;o much in point of time. Incidents were unnaturally crowded; and it
<PB N="328" REF="331">
is ea&s;y to point out &s;everal in&s;tances in the Greek Tragedies, where events are &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s during a Song of the Chorus, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have employed many hours.</P>
<P>BUT though it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et Mo|dern Poets free from a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the&s;e Dramatic Unities, yet we mu&s;t remem|ber, there are certain bounds to this liberty. Frequent and wild changes of time and place; hurrying the Spectator from one di&s;|tant city, or country, to another; or making &s;everal days or weeks, to pa&s;s during the cour&s;e of the Repre&s;entation, are liberties which &s;hock the imagination, which give to the performance a romantic and unnatural appearance, and, therefore, cannot be al|lowed in any Dramatic Writer who a&s;pires to correctne&s;s. In particular, we mu&s;t re|member, that it is only between the Acts, that any liberty can be given for going be|yond the Unities of Time and Place. During the cour&s;e of each Act, they ought to be &s;trictly ob&s;erved; that is, during each Act the Scene &s;hould continue the &s;ame, and no more time &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s, than is employed in the repre&s;entation of that Act. This is a rule which the French Tragedians regularly ob&s;erve. To violate this rule, as is too often done by the Engli&s;h; to change the place, and &s;hift the Scene in the mid&s;t of one Act, &s;hews great incorrectne&s;s, and de|&s;troys the whole intention of the divi&s;ion of a Play into Acts. Mr. Addi&s;on's Cato, is
<PB N="329" REF="332">
remarkable beyond mo&s;t Engli&s;h Tragedies, for regularity of conduct. The author has limited him&s;elf, in time, to a &s;ingle day; and in place, has maintained the mo&s;t ri|gorous unity. The Scene is never changed; and the whole action pa&s;&s;es in the hall of Cato's hou&s;e, at Utica.</P>
<P>IN general, the nearer that a Poet can bring the Dramatic Repre&s;entation, in all its circum&s;tances, to an imitation of nature and real life, the impre&s;&s;ion which he makes on us will always be the more perfect. Proba|bility, as I ob&s;erved at the beginning of the Lecture, is highly e&s;&s;ential to the conduct of the Tragic Action, and we are always hurt by the want of it. It is this that makes the ob&s;ervance of the Dramatic Unities to be of con&s;equence, as far as they can be ob&s;erved, without &s;acrificing more material beauties. It is not, as has been &s;ometimes &s;aid, that, by the pre&s;ervation of the Unities of Time and Place, Spectators, when they a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Theatre, are deceived into a belief of the reality of the objects which are there &s;et before them; and that, when tho&s;e Unities are violated, the charm is broken, and they di&s;cover the whole to be a fiction. No &s;uch deception as this can ever be accompli&s;hed. No one ever imagines him&s;elf to be at Athens, or Rome, when a Greek or Roman &s;ubject is pre&s;ented on the Stage. He knows the whole to be an imitation only; but he requires that
<PB N="330" REF="333">
imitation to be conducted, with &s;kill and veri&s;imilitude. His plea&s;ure, the entertain|ment which he expects, the intere&s;t which he is to take in the Story, all depend on its being &s;o conducted. His imagination, there|fore, &s;eeks to aid the imitation, and to re&s;t on the probability; and the Poet, who &s;hocks him by improbable circum&s;tances, and by awkward, un&s;kilful imitation, deprives him of his plea&s;ure, and leaves him hurt and di&s;|plea&s;ed. This is the whole my&s;tery of the theatrical illu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XLVI. TRAGEDY&mdash;GREEK&mdash;FRENCH&mdash;ENGLISH TRAGEDY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated of the Dramatic Action in Tragedy, I proceed next to treat of the Characters mo&s;t proper to be exhibited. It has been thought, by &s;everal Critics, that the nature of Tragedy requires the principal per&s;onages to be always of illu&s;trious charac|ter, and of high, or princely rank; who&s;e misfortunes and &s;ufferings, it is &s;aid, take fa&s;ter hold of the imagination, and impre&s;s the heart more forcibly, than &s;imilar events happening to per&s;ons in private life. But this is more &s;pecious, than &s;olid. It is re|futed by facts. For the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of De&s;da|mona, Monimia, and Belvidera, intere&s;t us as deeply as if they had been prince&s;&s;es or queens. The dignity of Tragedy does, in|deed, require, that there &s;hould be nothing
<PB N="332" REF="335">
degrading, or mean, in the circum&s;tances of the per&s;ons which it exhibits; but it requires nothing more. Their high rank may render the &s;pectacle more &s;plendid, and the &s;ubject &s;eemingly of more importance, but conduce very little to its being intere&s;ting or pathetic; which depends entirely on the nature of the Tale, on the art of the Poet in conducting it, and on the &s;entiments to which it gives occa&s;ion. In every rank of life, the rela|tions of Father, Hu&s;band, Son, Brother, Lover, or Friend, lay the foundation of tho&s;e affecting &s;ituations, which make man's heart feel for man.</P>
<P>THE moral characters of the per&s;ons re|pre&s;ented, are of much greater con&s;equence than the external circum&s;tances in which the Poet places them. Nothing, indeed, in the conduct of Tragedy, demands a Poet's atten|tion more, than &s;o to de&s;cribe his per&s;onages, and &s;o to order the incidents which relate to them, as &s;hall leave upon the Spectators, im|pre&s;&s;ions favourable to virtue, and to the ad|mini&s;tration of Providence. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for this end, that poetical ju&s;tice, as it is called, &s;hould be ob&s;erved in the ca|ta&s;trophe of the Piece. This has been long exploded from Tragedy; the end of which is, to affect us with pity for the virtuous in di&s;tre&s;s, and to afford a probable repre&s;enta|tion of the &s;tate of human life, where cala|mities often befal the be&s;t, and a mixed por|tion of good and evil is appointed for all.
<PB N="333" REF="336">
But, withal, the Author mu&s;t beware of &s;hocking our minds with &s;uch repre&s;entations of life as tend to rai&s;e horror, or to render virtue an object of aver&s;ion. Though inno|cent per&s;ons &s;uffer, their &s;ufferings ought to be attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as &s;hall make virtue appear amiable and venerable; and &s;hall render their condition, on the whole, preferable to that of bad men, who have prevailed again&s;t them. The &s;tings, and the remor&s;e of guilt, mu&s;t ever be repre|&s;ented as productive of greater mi&s;eries, than any that the bad can bring upon the good.</P>
<P>ARISTOTLE'S ob&s;ervations on the charac|ters proper for Tragedy, are very judicious. He is of opinion, that perfect unmixed characters, either of good or ill men, are not the fitte&s;t to be introduced. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the one being wholly unmerited, hurt and &s;hock us; and the &s;ufferings of the other, occa&s;ion no pity. Mixed characters, &s;uch as in fact we meet with in the world, afford the mo&s;t proper field for di&s;playing, without any bad effect on morals, the vici&s;&s;itudes of life; and they intere&s;t us the more deeply, as they di&s;play emotions and pa&s;&s;ions which we have all been con&s;cious of. When &s;uch per&s;ons fall into di&s;tre&s;s through the vices of others, the &s;ubject may be very pathetic; but it is always more in&s;tructive, when a per&s;on has been him&s;elf the cau&s;e of his misfortune, and when his misfortune is occa&s;ioned by the
<PB N="334" REF="337">
violence of Pa&s;&s;ion, or by &s;ome weakne&s;s in|cident to human nature. Such &s;ubjects both di&s;po&s;e us to the deepe&s;t &s;ympathy, and ad|mini&s;ter u&s;eful warnings to us for our own conduct.</P>
<P>UPON the&amp;;se principles, if &s;urpri&s;es me that the &s;tory of OEdipus &s;hould have been &s;o much celebrated by all Critics, as one of the fittest for Tragedy; and &s;o often brought upon the Stage, not by Sophocles only, but by Corneille al&s;o, and Voltaire. An innocent per&s;on, one, in the main, of a virtuous character, through no crime of his own, nay not by the vices of others, but through mere fatality an dblind chance, is in|volved in the greate&s;t of all human mi&s;eries. In a ca&s;ual recounter, he kills his father, without knowing him; he afterwards is mar|ried to his own mother; and, di&s;covering him&s;elf in the end to have committed both parricide and ince&s;t, he becomes frantic, and dies in the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery. Such a &s;ubject excites horror rather than pity. As it is con|ducted by Sophocles, it is indeed extremely affecting; but it conveys no in&s;truction, it awakens in the mind no tender &s;ympathy; it leaves no impre&s;&s;ion favourable to virtue or humanity.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowedged, that the &s;ubjects of the ancient Greek Tragedies were too often founded on mere de&s;tiny, and inevita|ble misfortunes. They were too much mixed
<PB N="335" REF="338">
with their tales about oracles, and the ven|geance of th eGods, which led to many an incident &s;ufficiently melancholy and tragical; but rather purely tragical, than u&s;eful or moral. Hence both the OEdipus's of Sophocles, the Iphigenia in Aulis, the Hecuba of Europides, and &s;everal of the like kind. In the cour&s;e of the drama, many moral &s;entiments occur|red. But the in&s;truction, which the Fable of the Play conveyed, &s;eldom was any more, than that reverence was owing to th eGods, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to the decrees of De&s;tiny. Modern Tragedy has aimed at a higher ob|ject, by becoming more the theatre of pa&s;&s;ion; pointing out to men the con&s;equences of their own mi&s;conduct; &s;hewing th direful effects which ambition, jealou&s;y, love, re&s;entment, and other &s;uch &s;trong emotions, when mi&s;|guided, or left unre&s;trained, produce upon human life. An Othello, hurried by jealou&s;y to murder his innocent wife; a Jaffier, en|&s;nared by re&s;entment an dwant, to engage in a con&s;piracy, and then &s;tung with remor&s;e, and involved in ruin; a Siffredi, through the deceit which he employs for public-&s;pirited ends, bringing de&s;truction on all whom he loved; a Cali&s;ta, &s;educed into a criminal in|trigue, which overwhelms her&s;elf, her father, and all her friends in mi&s;ery: the&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the examples which Tragedy now di&s;plays to public view; and by means of which, it inculcatges on men the proper government of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="339">
OF all the pa&s;&s;ions which furni&s;h matter to Tragedy, that which has mo&s;t occupied the Modern Stage, is Love. To the Ancient Theatre, it was in a manner wholly un|known. In few of their Tragedies is it ever mentioned; and I remember no more than one which turns upon it, the Hippolitus of Euripides. This was owing to the national manners of the Greeks, and to that greater &s;eparation of the two &s;exes from one another, than has taken place in modern times; aided too, perhaps, by this circum&s;tance, that no female actors ever appeared on the Ancient Stage. But though no rea&s;on appears for the total exclu&s;ion of Love from the Theatre, yet with what ju&s;tice or propriety it has u&s;urped &s;o much place, as to be in a manner the &s;ole hinge of Modern Tragedy, may be much que&s;tioned. Voltaire, who is no le&s;s eminent as a Critic than as a Poet, declares loudly and &s;trongly again&s;t this predominancy of love, as both degrading the Maje&s;ty, and confining the natural limits of Tragedy. And a&s;&s;uredly, the mixing of it perpetually with all the great and &s;olemn revolutions of human fortune which belong to the Tragic Stage, tends to give Tragedy too much the air of gallantry, and juvenile entertainment. The Athalie of Racine, the Merop&eacute; of Voltaire, the Douglas of Mr. Home, are &s;uf|ficient proofs, that without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Love, the Drama is capable of produ|cing its highe&s;t effects upon the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="340">
THIS &s;eems to be clear, that wherever Love is introduced into Tragedy, it ought to reign in it, and to give ri&s;e to the principal action. It ought to be that &s;ort of Love which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the force and maje&s;ty of pa&s;|&s;ion; and which occa&s;ions great and impor|tant con&s;equences. For nothing can have a wor&s;e effect, or be more deba&s;ing to Tra|gedy, than, together with the manly and heroic pa&s;&s;ions, to mingle a trifling Love intrigue, as a &s;ort of &s;ea&s;oning to the Play. The bad effects of this, are &s;ufficiently con|&s;picuous both in the Cato of Mr. Addi&s;on, as I had occa&s;ion before to remark, and in the Iphiginie of Racine.</P>
<P>AFTER a Tragic Poet has arranged his &s;ubject, and cho&s;en his per&s;onages, the next thing he mu&s;t attend to, is the propriety of &s;entiments; that they may be perfectly &s;uited to the characters of tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom they are attributed, and to the &s;ituations in which they are placed. The nece&s;&s;ity of ob|&s;erving this general rule is &s;o obvious, that I need not in&s;i&s;t upon it. It is principally in the pathetic parts, that both the difficulty and the importance of it are the greate&s;t. Tragedy is the region of pa&s;&s;ion. We come to it, expecting to be moved; and let the Poet be ever &s;o judicious in his conduct, mo|ral in his intentions, and elegant in his Style, yet if he fails in the pathetic, he has no tragic merit; we return cold and di&s;appointed from
<PB N="338" REF="341">
the performance; and never de&s;ire to meet with it more.</P>
<P>TO paint Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o truly and ju&s;tly as to &s;trike the hearts of the Hearers with full &s;ym|pathy, is a prerogative of genius given to few. It requires &s;trong and ardent &s;en&s;ibility of mind. It requires the Author to have the power of entering deeply into the characters which he draws; of becoming for a moment the very per&s;on whom he exhibits, and of a&s;&s;uming all his feelings. For as I have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;peaking properly the language of any pa&s;&s;ion, without feeling it; and it is to the ab&s;ence or deadne&s;s of real emotion, that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the want of &s;ucce&s;s in &s;o many Tragic Writers, when they attempt being pathetic.</P>
<P>NO man, for in&s;tance, when he is under the &s;trong agitations of anger, or grief, or any &s;uch violent pa&s;&s;ion, ever thinks of de|&s;cribing to another what his feelings at that time are; or of telling them what he re&s;em|bles. This never was, and never will be, the language of any per&s;on, when he is deep|ly moved. It is the language of one who de&s;cribes coolly the condition of that per&s;on to another; or it is the language of the pa&s;|&s;ionate per&s;on him&s;elf, after his emotion has &s;ub&s;ided, relating what his &s;ituation was in the moments of pa&s;&s;ion. Yet this &s;ort of &s;econdary de&s;cription, is what Tragic Poets
<PB N="339" REF="342">
too often give us, in&s;tead of the native and primary language of pa&s;&s;ion. Thus, in Mr. Addi&s;on's Cato, when Lucia confe&s;&s;es to Portius her love for him, but, at the &s;ame time, &s;wears with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, that in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of their country &s;he will never marry him; Portius receives this unexpected &s;entence with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ment and grief; at lea&s;t the Poet wants to make us believe that he &s;o received it. How does he expre&s;s the&s;e feelings?<Q><L>Fix'd in a&s;toni&s;hment, I gaze upon thee,</L>
<L>Like one ju&s;t bla&s;ted by a &s;troke from Heav'n,</L>
<L>Who pants for breath, and &s;tiffens yet alive</L>
<L>In dreadful looks; a monument of wrath.</L></Q> This makes his whole reply to Lucia. Now did any per&s;on, who was of a &s;udden a&s;to|ni&s;hed and overwhelmed with &s;orrow, ever, &s;ince the creation of the world, expre&s;s him|&s;elf in this manner? This is indeed an excel|lent de&s;cription to be given us by another, of a per&s;on who was in &s;uch a &s;ituation. No|thing would have been more proper for a by&s;tander, recounting this conference, than to have &s;aid,<Q><L>Fix'd in a&s;toni&s;hment, he gazed upon her,</L>
<L>Like one ju&s;t bla&s;ted by a &s;troke from heaven,</L>
<L>Who pants for breath, &amp;c.</L></Q> But the per&s;on, who is him&s;elf concerned, &s;peaks on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, in a very differ|ent manner. He gives vent to his feelings;
<PB N="340" REF="343">
he pleads for pity; he dwells upon the cau&s;e of his grief and a&s;toni&s;hment; but never thinks of de&s;cribing his own per&s;on and looks, and &s;howing us, by a &s;imile, what he re&s;embles. Such repre&s;entations of pa&s;&s;ions are no better in Poetry, than it would be in painting, to make a label i&s;&s;ue from the mouth of a figure, bidding us remark, that this figure repre&s;ents an a&s;toni&s;hed, or a grieved per&s;on.</P>
<P>ON &s;ome other occa&s;ions, when Poets do not employ this &s;ort of de&s;criptive language in pa&s;&s;ion, they are too apt to run into forced and unnatural thoughts, in order to exag|gerate the feelings of per&s;ons, whom they would paint as very &s;trongly moved. When O&s;myn, in the Mourning Bride, after part|ing with Almeria, regrets, in a long &s;olilo|quy, that his eyes only &s;ee objects that are pre&s;ent, and cannot &s;ee Almeria after &s;he is gone; when Jane &s;hore, in Mr. Rowe's Tra|gedy, on meeting with her hu&s;band in her extreme di&s;tre&s;s, and finding that he had for|given her, calls on the rains to give her their drops, and the &s;prings to give her their &s;treams, that &s;he may never want a &s;upply of tears; in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, we &s;ee very plainly, that it is neither O&s;myn, nor Jane Shore, that &s;peak; but the Poet him&s;elf in his own per|&s;on, who, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;uming the feelings of tho&s;e whom he means to exhibit, and &s;peak|ing as they would have done in &s;uch &s;itua|tions, is &s;training his fancy, and &s;purring up
<PB N="541" REF="344">
his genius, to &s;ay &s;omething that &s;hall be un|commonly &s;trong and lively.</P>
<P>IF we attend to the language that is &s;poken by per&s;ons under the influence of real pa&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall find it always plain and &s;imple; abounding indeed with tho&s;e figures which expre&s;s a di&s;turbed and impetuous &s;tate of mind, &s;uch as interrogations, excla|mations, and apo&s;trophes; but never em|ploying tho&s;e which belong to the mere em|belli&s;hment and parade of Speech. We ne|ver meet with any &s;ubtilty or refinement, in the &s;entiments of real pa&s;&s;ion. The thoughts which pa&s;&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ts, are always plain and obvious ones, ari&s;ing directly from its object. Pa&s;&s;ion never rea&s;ons nor &s;peculates, till its ardour begins to cool. It never leads to long di&s;cour&s;e or declamation. On the contrary, it expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf mo&s;t commonly in &s;hort, broken, and interrupted Speeches; corre&s;|ponding to the violent and de&s;ultory emotions of the mind.</P>
<P>WHEN we examine the French Tragedi|ans by the&s;e principles, which &s;eem clearly founded in nature, we find them often defi|cient. Though in many parts of Tragic Compo&s;ition, they have great merit; though in exciting &s;oft and tender emotions, &s;ome of them are very &s;ucce&s;sful; yet in the high and &s;trong pathetic, they generally fail. Their pa&s;&s;ionate Speeches too often run into long declamation. There is too much rea&s;oning
<PB N="342" REF="345">
and refinement; too much pomp and &s;tudied beauty in them. They rather convey a fee|ble impre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion, than awaken any &s;trong &s;ympathy in the Reader's mind.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES and Euripides are much more &s;ucce&s;sful in this part of Compo&s;ition. In their pathetic &s;cenes, we find no unnatural re|finement; no exaggerated thoughts. They &s;et before us the plain and direct feelings of na|ture, in &s;imple expre&s;&s;ive language; and therefore, on great occa&s;ions, they &s;eldom fail of touching the heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Nothing, for in&s;tance, can be more touching and pa|thetic than the addre&s;s which Medea, in Euripides, makes to her children, when &s;he had formed the re&s;olution of put|ting them to death; and nothing more natural, than the conflict which is de&s;cribed, as &s;uffering within her&s;elf on that occa&s;ion:

This too is Shake&s;peare's great excellency; and to this it is principally owing, that his dramatic produc|tions, notwith&s;tanding their many imperfec|tions, have been &s;o long the favourites of the Public. He is more faithful to the true lan|guage of Nature, in the mid&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, than any Writer. He gives us this language, un|adulterated by art; and more in&s;tances of it can be quoted from him, than from all other Tragic Poets put together. I &s;hall refer only
<PB N="343" REF="346">
to that admirable &s;cene in Macbeth, where Macduff receives the account of his wife, and all his children being &s;laughtered in his ab&s;ence. The emotions, fir&s;t of grief, and then of the mo&s;t fierce re&s;entment ri&s;ing again&s;t Macbeth, are painted in &s;uch a man|ner, that there is no heart but mu&s;t feel them, and no fancy can conceive any thing more expre&s;&s;ive of Nature.</P>
<P>WITH regard to moral &s;entiments and re|flections in Tragedies, it is clear that they mu&s;t not recur too often. They lo&s;e their effect, when un&s;ea&s;onably crowded. They render the play pedantic and declamatory. This is remarkably the ca&s;e with tho&s;e Latin Tragedies which go under the name of Se|neca, which are little more than a collec|tion of declamations and moral &s;entiments, wrought up with a quaint brilliancy, which &s;uited the prevalling ta&s;te of that age.</P>
<P>I AM not, however, of opinion, that mo|ral reflections ought to be altogether omitted in Tragedies. When properly introduced, they give dignity to the Compo&s;ition, and, on many occa&s;ions they are extremely natu|ral. When per&s;ons are under any uncommon di&s;tre&s;s, when they are beholding in others, or experiencing in them&s;elves, the vici&s;&s;itudes of human fortune; indeed, when they are placed in any of the great and trying &s;itu|ations of life, &s;erious and moral reflections naturally occur in them, whether they be
<PB N="344" REF="347">
per&s;ons of much virtue or not. Hardly is there any per&s;on, but who, on &s;uch occa&s;i|ons, is di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;erious. It is then the natural tone of the mind; and therefore no Tragic Poet &s;hould omit &s;uch proper oppor|tunities, when they occur, for favouring the the intere&s;ts of virtue. Cardinal Wol&s;ey's &s;oliloquy upon his fall, for in&s;tance, in Shake|&s;peare, when he bids a long farewell to all his greatne&s;s, and the advices which he after|wards gives to Cromwell, are, in his &s;itua|tion, extremely natural; touch and plea&s;e all Readers; and are at once in&s;tructive and af|fecting. Much of the merit of Mr. Ad|di&s;on's Cato depends upon that moral turn of thought which di&s;tingui&s;hes it. I have had occa&s;ion, both in this Lecture and in the preceding one, to take notice of &s;ome of its defects; and certainly neither for warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, nor proper conduct of the plot, is it at all eminent. It does not, however, follow, that it is de&s;titute of merit. For, by the purity and beauty of the language, by the dignity of Cato's Character, by that ar|dour of public &s;pirit, and tho&s;e virtuous &s;entiments of which it is full, it has always commanded high regard; and has, both in our own country and among foreigners, ac|quired no &s;mall reputation.</P>
<P>THE Style and Ver&s;ification of Tragedy, ought to be free, ea&s;y, and varied. Our blank ver&s;e is happily &s;uited to this purpo&s;e. It has &s;ufficient maje&s;ty for rai&s;ing the Style;
<PB N="345" REF="348">
it can de&s;cend to the &s;imple and familiar; it is &s;u&s;ceptible of great variety of cadence; and is quite free from the con&s;traint and mo|notony of rhyme. For monotony is, above all things, to be avoided by a Tragic Poet. If he maintains every where the &s;ame &s;tate|line&s;s of Style, if he uniformly keeps up the &s;ame run of mea&s;ure and harmony in his Ver&s;e, he cannot fail of becoming in&s;ipid. He &s;hould not indeed &s;ink into flat and care|le&s;s lines; his Style &s;hould always have force and dignity, but not the uniform dignity of Epic Poetry. It &s;hould a&s;&s;ume that bri&s;kne&s;s and ea&s;e, which is &s;uited to the freedom of dialogue, and the fluctuations of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t misfortunes of the French Tragedy is, its being always written in rhyme. The nature of the French lan|guage, indeed, requires this, in order to di&s;|tingui&s;h the Style from mere pro&s;e. But it fetters the freedom of the Tragic Dialogue, fills it with a languid monotony, and is, in a manner fatal to the high &s;trength and power of pa&s;&s;ion. Voltaire maintains, that the dif|ficulty of compo&s;ing in French Rhyme, is one great cau&s;e of the plea&s;ure which the Audience receives from the Compo&s;ition. Tragedy would be ruined, &s;ays he, if we were to write it in Blank Ver&s;e; take away the difficulty, and you take away the whole merit. A &s;trange idea! as if the entertain|ment of the Audience aro&s;e, not from the emotions which the Poet is &s;ucce&s;sful in
<PB N="346" REF="349">
awakening, but from a reflection on the toil which he endured in his clo&s;et, from a&s;&s;ort|ing male and female Rhymes. With regard to tho&s;e &s;plendid compari&s;ons in Rhyme, and &s;trings of couplets, with which it was, &s;ome time ago, fa&s;hionable for our Engli&s;h Poets to conclude, not only every act of a Tra|gedy, but &s;ometimes al&s;o the mo&s;t intere&s;ting Scenes, nothing need be &s;aid, but that they were the mo&s;t perfect barbari&s;ms; childi&s;h ornaments, introduced to plea&s;e a fal&s;e ta&s;te in the Audience; and now univer&s;ally laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>HAVING thus treated of all the different parts of Tragedy, I &s;hall conclude the &s;ubject, with a &s;hort view of the Greek, the French, and the Engli&s;h Stage, and with ob&s;ervations on the principal Writers.</P>
<P>MOST of the di&s;tingui&s;hed characters of the Greek Tragedy have been already occa|&s;ionally mentioned. It was embelli&s;hed with the Lyric Poetry of the Chorus, of the origin of which, and of the advantages and di&s;|advantages attending it, I treated fully in the preceding Lecture. The Plot was always exceedingly &s;imple. It admitted of few in|cidents. It was conducted for mo&s;t part, with a very exact regard to the unities of action, time, and place. Machinery, or the intervention of the Gods, was employed; and, which is very faulty, the final unravel|ling &s;ometimes made to turn upon it. Love,
<PB N="347" REF="350">
except in one or two in&s;tances, was never admitted into the Greek Tragedy. Their &s;ubjects were often founded on de&s;tiny, or inevitable misfortunes. A vein of religious and moral &s;entiment always runs through them; but they made le&s;s u&s;e than the Mo|derns of the combat of the pa&s;&s;ions, and of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which our pa&s;&s;ions bring upon us. Their plots were all taken from the an|cient traditionary &s;tories of their own nation. Hercules furni&s;hes matter for two Tragedies. The hi&s;tory of Oedipus, king of Thebes, and his unfortunate family, for &s;ix. The war of Troy, with its con&s;equences, for no fewer than &s;eventeen. There is only one, of later date than this; which is the Per&s;ae, or expedition of Xerxes, by Ae&s;chylus.</P>
<P>AESCHYLUS, is the Father of Greek Tra|gedy, and exhibits both the beauties, and the defects, of an early original Writer. He is bold, nervous, and animated; but very ob|&s;cure and difficult to be under&s;tood; partly by rea&s;on of the incorrect &s;tate in which we have his works (they having &s;uffered more by time, than any of the Ancient Tragedians), and partly, on account of the nature of his Style, which is crowded with metaphors, often har&s;h and tumid. He abounds with martial ideas and de&s;criptions. He has much fire and elevation; le&s;s of tenderne&s;s, than of force. He delights in the marvellous. The Gho&s;t of Darius in the Per&s;ae, the In|&s;piration of Ca&s;&s;andra in Agamemnon, and
<PB N="348" REF="351">
the Songs of the Furies in the Eumenides, are beautiful in their kind, and &s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his genius.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES is the mo&s;t ma&s;terly of the three Greek Tragedians; the mo&s;t correct in the conduct of his &s;ubjects; the mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;ublime in his &s;entiments. He is emi|nent for his de&s;criptive talent. The relation of the death of OEdipus, in his OEdipus Coloneus, and of the death of Haemon and Antigone, in his Antigone, are perfect pat|terns of de&s;cription to Tragic Poets. Euri|pides is e&s;teemed more tender than Sophocles; and he is fuller of moral &s;entiments. But, in the conduct of his plays, he is more incor|rect and negligent; his expo&s;itions, or open|ings of the &s;ubject, are made in a le&s;s artful manner; and the Songs of his Chorus, tho' remarkably poetical, have, commonly, le&s;s connection with the main action, than tho&s;e of Sophocles. Both Euripides and Sophocles, however, have very high merit as Tragic Poets. They are elegant and beautiful in their Style; ju&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, in their thoughts; they &s;peak with the voice of na|ture; and making allowance for the diffe|rence of ancient and modern ideas, in the mid&s;t of all their &s;implicity, they are touching and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of theatrical repre&s;en|tation on the &s;tages of Greece and Rome, were, in &s;everal re&s;pects, very &s;ingular, and
<PB N="349" REF="352">
widely different from what obtains among us. Not only were the Songs of the Chorus ac|companied with in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, but the Abb&eacute; de Bos, in his Reflections on Poetry and Painting, has proved, with much curious erudition, that the dialogue part had al&s;o a modulation of its own, which was capable of being &s;et to notes; that it was carried on in a &s;ort of recitative between the actors, and was &s;upported by in&s;truments. He has farther attempted to prove, but the proof &s;eems more dubious, that, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, on the Roman &s;tage, the pronouncing and ge&s;ticulating parts were divided; that one actor &s;poke, and another performed the ge&s;|tures and motions corre&s;ponding to what the fir&s;t &s;aid. The actors in Tragedy wore a long robe, called Smyrna, which flowed upon the Stage. They were rai&s;ed upon Cothurni, which rendered their &s;tature uncommonly high; and they always played in ma&s;ques. The&s;e ma&s;ques were like helmets, which covered the whole head; they mouths of them were &s;o contrived, as to give an artifi|cial &s;ound to the voice, in order to make it be heard over their va&s;t theatres; and the vi&s;age was &s;o formed and painted, as to &s;uit the age, characters, or di&s;po&s;itions of the per|&s;ons repre&s;ented. When, during the cour&s;e of one Scene, different emotions were to ap|pear in the &s;ame per&s;on, the ma&s;que is &s;aid to have been &s;o painted, that the Actor, by turning one or other profile of his face to the Spectators, expre&s;&s;ed the change of the &s;itua|ation.
<PB N="350" REF="353">
This, however, was a contrivance attended with many di&s;advantages. The ma&s;que mu&s;t have deprived the Spectators of all the plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from the natural animated expre&s;&s;ion of the eye and the coun|tenance; and, joined with the other circum|&s;tances which I have mentioned, is apt to give us but an unfavourable idea of the dra|matic repre&s;entations of the Ancients. In defence of them, it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be remembered, that their theatres were va&s;tly more exten&s;ive in the area than ours, and filled with immen&s;e crowds. They were always uncovered, and expo&s;ed to the open air. The actors were beheld at a much greater di&s;tance, and of cour&s;e much more imperfectly by the bulk of the Spectators, which both rendered their looks of le&s;s con|&s;equence, and might make it in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;ary that their features &s;hould be exag|gerated, the &s;ound of their voices enlarged, and their whole appearance magnified beyond the life, in order to make the &s;tronger im|pre&s;&s;ion. It is certain, that, as dramatic &s;pectacles were the favourite entertainments of the Greeks and Romans, the attention given to their proper exhibition, and the magnificence of the apparatus be&s;towed on their theatres, far exceeded any thing that has been attempted in modern ages.</P>
<P>IN the Compo&s;itions of &s;ome of the French Dramatic Writers, particularly Corneille, Ra|cine, and Voltaire, Tragedy has appeared
<PB N="351" REF="354">
with much lu&s;tre, and dignity. They mu&s;t be allowed to have improved upon the An|cients, in introducing more incidents, a greater variety of pa&s;&s;ions, a fuller di&s;play of characters, and in rendering the &s;ubject there|by more intere&s;ting. They have &s;tudied to imitate the ancient models in regularity of conduct. They are attentive to all the uni|ties, and to all the decorums of &s;entiment and morality; and their Style is, generally, very poetical and elegant. What an Engli&s;h ta&s;te is mo&s;t apt to cen&s;ure in them, is the want of fervour, &s;trength, and the natural lan|guage of pa&s;&s;ion. There is often too much conver&s;ation in their pieces, in&s;tead of action. They are too declamatory, as was before ob|&s;erved, when they &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ionate; too refined, when they &s;hould be &s;imple. Vol|taire freely acknowledges tho&s;e defects of the French Theatre. He admits, that their be&s;t Tragedies make not a deep enough impre&s;&s;i|on the heart; that the gallantry which reigns in them, and the long fine &s;pun dialogue with which they over-abound, frequently &s;pread a languor over them; that the Au|thors &s;eemed to be afraid of being too tragic; and very candidly gives it as his judgment, that an union of the vehemence and the action, which characteri&s;e the Engli&s;h The|atre, with the correctne&s;s and decorum of the French, Theatre, would be nece&s;&s;ary to form a perfect Tragedy.</P>

CORNEILLE, who is properly the Father of French Tragedy, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the maje&s;ty and grandeur of his &s;entiments, and the fruitfulne&s;s of his imagination. His ge|nius was unque&s;tionably very rich, but &s;eem|ed more turned towards the Epic than the Tragic vein; for, in general, he is magni|ficent and &s;plendid, rather than tender and touching. He is the mo&s;t declamatory of all the French Tragedians. He united the co|piou&s;ne&s;s of Dryden with the fire of Lucan, and he re&s;embles them al&s;o in their faults; in their extravagance and impetuo&s;ity. He has compo&s;ed a great number of Tragedies, very unequal in their merit. His be&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;teemed pieces, are the Cid, Horace, Polyeucte, and Cinna.</P>
<P>RACINE, as a Tragic Poet, is much &s;upe|rior to Corneille. He wanted the copiou&s;ne&s;s and grandeur of Corneille's imagination; but is free of his bomba&s;t, and excels him greatly in tenderne&s;s. Few Poets indeed, are more tender and moving than Racine. His Phae|dra, his Andromaque, his Athalie, and his Mithridate, are excellent dramatic performan|ces, and do no &s;mall honour to the French Stage. His language and ver&s;ification are uncommonly beautiful. Of all the French Authors, he appears to me to have mo&s;t ex|celled in Poetical Style; to have managed their Rhyme with the greate&s;t advantage and facility, and to have given it the mo&s;t com|plete harmony. Voltaire has, again and
<PB N="353" REF="356">
again, pronounced Racine's Athalie to be the <Q REND="inline">"Chief d'Oeuvre"</Q> of the French Stage. It is altogether a &s;acred drama, and owes much of its elevation to the Maje&s;ty of Religion; but it is le&s;s tender and intere&s;ting than An|dromaque. Racine has formed two of his plays upon plans of Euripides. In the Phae|dra he is extremely &s;ucce&s;sful, but not &s;o, in my opinion, in the Iphigenie; where he has degraded the ancient characters, by un&s;ea|&s;onable gallantry. Achilles is a French Lo|ver; and Eriphile, a modern Lady<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The characters of Corneille and Racine are happily contra&s;ted with one another, in the following beautiful lines of a French Poet, which will gratify &s;everal readers.

VOLTAIRE, in &s;everal of his Tragedies, is inferior to none of his predece&s;&s;ors.

He is not, in|deed, exempt from the defects of the other French Tragedians, of wanting force, and of being &s;ometimes too long and declamatory in his &s;peeches; but his characters are drawn with &s;pirit, his events are &s;triking, and in his &s;entiments there is much elevation. His Zaire, Alzire, Merop&eacute;, and Orphan of China, are four capital Tragedies, and de|&s;erve the highe&s;t prai&s;e.

THOUGH the mu&s;ical Dramas of Meta&s;ta|&s;io fulfil not the character of ju&s;t and regular Tragedies, they approach however &s;o near to it, and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much merit, that it would be unju&s;t to pa&s;s them over without notice. For the elegance of Style, the charms of Lyric Poetry, and the beauties of &s;entiment, they are eminent. They abound in well|contrived and intere&s;ting &s;ituations. The dialogue, by its clo&s;ene&s;s and rapidity, carries a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance to that of the Ancient Greek Tragedies; and is both more animated and more natural, than the long declamation of the French theatre. But the &s;hortne&s;s of the &s;everal Dramas, and the in|termixture of &s;o much Lyric Poetry as be|longs to this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition, often occa&s;ions the cour&s;e of the incidents to be hurried on too quickly, and prevents that con&s;i&s;tent di&s;play of characters, and that full preparation of events, which are nece&s;&s;ary to give a proper veri&s;imilitude to Tragedy.</P>
<P>IT only now remains to &s;peak of the &s;tate of Tragedy in Great Britain; the general character of which is, that it is more animat|ed and pa&s;&s;ionate than French Tragedy, but more irregular and incorrect, and le&s;s atten|tive to decorum and to elegance. The pa|thetic, it mu&s;t always be remembered, is the &s;oul of Tragedy.

<P>THE fir&s;t object which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us on the Engli&s;h Theatre, is the great Shake|&s;peare. Great he may be ju&s;tly called, as the extent and force of his natural genius, both for Tragedy and Comedy, is altogether un|rivalled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The character which Dryden has drawn of Shake&s;peare is not only ju&s;t, but uncommonly elegant and happy. <Q REND="inline">"He was the man, who of all modern, and perhaps ancient Poets, had the large&s;t and mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;oul.

They who accu&s;e him of wanting learning, give him the greate&s;t commendation. He was naturally learned. He needed not the Spectacles of Books to read Nature. He looked inward, and found her there. I cannot &s;ay he is every where alike. Were he &s;o, I &s;hould do him injury, to compare him to the greate&s;t of mankind. He is many times flat and in&s;ipid; his comic wit degenerating into clenches; his &s;erious &s;welling into bomba&s;t.

But, at the &s;ame time, it is ge|nius &s;hooting wild; deficient in ju&s;t ta&s;te, and altogether una&s;&s;i&s;ted by knowledge or art. Long has he been idoli&s;ed by the Briti&s;h na|tion; much has been &s;aid, and much has been written concerning him; Critici&s;m has been drawn to the very dregs, in commenta|ries upon his words and wittici&s;ms; and yet it remains, to this day, in doubt, whether his beauties, or his faults, be greate&s;t. Ad|mirable &s;cenes, and pa&s;&s;ages, without num|ber, there are in his Plays; pa&s;&s;ages beyond
<PB N="357" REF="360">
what are to be found in any other Dramatic Writer; but there is hardly any one of his Plays which can be called altogether a good one, or which can be read with uninterrupt|ed plea&s;ure from beginning to end. Be&s;ides extreme irregularities in conduct, and gro|te&s;que mixtures of &s;erious and comic in one piece, we are every now and then interrupt|ed by unnatural thoughts, har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, a certain ob&s;cure bomba&s;t, and a play upon words, which he is fond of pur&s;uing: and the&s;e interruptions to our plea&s;ure too fre|quently occur, on occa&s;ions, when we would lea&s;t wi&s;h to meet with them. All tho&s;e faults, however, Shake&s;peare redeems, by two of the greate&s;t excellencies which any Tragic Poet can po&s;&s;e&s;s; his lively and diver|&s;ified paintings of character; his &s;trong and natural expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are his two chief virtues; on the&s;e his merit re&s;ts. Notwith&s;tanding his many ab&s;urdities, all the while we are reading his plays, we find our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of our fellows; we meet with men, vulgar perhaps in their man|ners, coar&s;e or har&s;h in their &s;entiments, but &s;till they are men; they &s;peak with human voices, and are actuated by human pa&s;&s;ions; we are intere&s;ted in what they &s;ay or do, be|cau&s;e we feel that they are of the &s;ame na|ture with our&s;elves. It is therefore no mat|ter of wonder, that from the more poli&s;hed and regular, but more cold and artificial per|formances of other Poets, the Public &s;hould return with plea&s;ure to &s;uch warm and ge|nuine

repre&s;entations of human nature. Shake&s;peare po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es likewi&s;e the merit of having created, for him&s;elf, a &s;ort of world of praeternatural beings. His witches, gho&s;ts, fairies, and &s;pirits of all kinds, are de&s;cribed with &s;uch circum&s;tances of awful and my&s;terious &s;olemnity, and &s;peak a lan|guage &s;o peculiar to them&s;elves, as &s;trongly to affect the imagination. His two ma&s;ter|pieces, and in which, in my opinion, the &s;trength of his genius chiefly appears, are, Othello and Mackbeth. With regard to his hi&s;torical plays, they are, properly &s;peak|ing, neither Tragedies nor Comedies; but a peculiar &s;pecies of Dramatic Entertainment, calculated to de&s;cribe the manners of the times of which he treats, to exhibit the prin|cipal characters, and to fix our imagination on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting events and revolutions of our own country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See an excellent defence of Shake&s;peare's Hi&s;torical Plays, and &s;everal ju&s;t ob&s;ervations on his peculiar excellen|cies as a Tragic Poet, in Mr. Montague's E&s;&s;ay on the Wri|tings and Genius of Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the age of Shake&s;peare, we can produce in the Engli&s;h language &s;everal de|tached Tragedies of con&s;iderable merit. But we have not many Dramatic Writers, who&s;e whole works are entitled either to particular critici&s;m, or very high prai&s;e. In the Tra|gedies of Dryden and Lee, there is much fire, but mixed with much fu&s;tian and rant. Lee's Theodo&s;ius, or the "Force of Love," is the

be&s;t of his pieces, and, in &s;ome of the &s;cenes, does not want tenderne&s;s and warmth; though romantic in the plan and extravagant in the &s;entiments. Otway was endowed with a high portion of the Tragic &s;pirit; which ap|pears to great advantage in his two principal Tragedies, "the Orphan," and Venice Pre|&s;erved." In the&s;e, he is perhaps too Tragic; the di&s;tre&s;&s;es being &s;o deep, as to tear and overwhelm the mind. He is a Writer, doubt|le&s;s, of genious and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion; but at, the &s;ame time, exceedingly gro&s;s and inde|licate. No Tragedies are le&s;s moral than tho&s;e of Otway. There are no generous or noble &s;entiments in them; but a licentious &s;pirit often di&s;covers it&s;elf. He is the very oppo&s;ite of the French decorum; and has contrived to introduce ob&s;cenity and inde|cent allu&s;ions, into the mid&s;t of deep Tra|gedy.</P>
<P>ROWE'S Tragedies make a contra&s;t to tho&s;e of Otway. He is full of elevated and moral &s;entiments. The Poetry is often good, and the language always pure and elegant: but, in mo&s;t of his Plays, he is too cold and un|intere&s;ting; and flowery rather than tragic. Two, however, he has produced, which de|&s;erve to be exempted from this cen&s;ure, Jane Shore and the Fair Penitent; in both of which, there are &s;o many tender and truly pathetic &s;cenes, as to render them ju&s;tly fa|vourites of the Public.</P>

DR. YOUNGE'S Revenge, is a play which di&s;covers genius and fire; but wants tender|ne&s;s, and turns too much upon the &s;hocking and direful pa&s;&s;ions. In Congreve's Mourn|ing Bride, there are &s;ome fine &s;ituations, and much good Poetry. The two fir&s;t Acts are admirable. The meeting of Almeria with her hu&s;band O&s;myn, in the tomb of An|&s;elmo, is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;trik|ing &s;ituations to be found in any Tragedy. The defects in the cata&s;trophe, I pointed out in the la&s;t Lecture. Mr. Thom&s;on's Trage|dies are too full of a &s;tiff morality, which renders them dull and formal.

<P>UPON the whole; reviewing the Tragic Compo&s;itions of different nations, the fol|lowing conclu&s;ions ari&s;e. A Greek Tragedy is the relation of any di&s;tre&s;sful or melan|choly incident; &s;ometimes the effect of pa&s;|&s;ion or crime, oftner of the decree of the Gods, &s;imply expo&s;ed; without much variety of parts or events, but naturally and beautifully &s;et before us; heightened by the Poetry of the Chorus. A French Tragedy, is a &s;eries of artful and refined conver&s;ations, founded upon a variety of tragical and intere&s;ting &s;ituations; carried on with little action and
<PB N="361" REF="364">
vehemence; but with much poetical beauty, and high propriety and decorum. An Eng|li&s;h Tragedy is the combat of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, &s;et before us in all their violence; producing deep di&s;a&s;ters; often irregularly conducted; abounding in action; and filling the Spec|tators with grief. The Ancient Tragedies were more natural and &s;imple; the Moderns are more artful and complex. Among the French, there is more correctne&s;s; among the Engli&s;h, more fire. Andromaque and Zayre, &s;often; Othello and Venice Pre&s;erved, rend the heart. It de&s;erves remark, that three of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter-pieces of the French Tragic Theatre, turn wholly upon religious &s;ubjects: the Athalie of Racine, the Polyeucte of Corneille, and the Zayre of Voltaire. The fir&s;t is founded upon a hi&s;|torical pa&s;&s;age of the Old Te&s;tament; in the other two, the di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;es from the zeal and attachment of the principal per&s;onages to the Chri&s;tian faith; and in all the three, the Authors have, with much propriety, availed them&s;elves of the Maje&s;ty which may be de|rived from religious ideas.</P>

<HEAD>LECTURE XLVII. COMEDY&mdash;GREEK AND ROMAN&mdash;FRENCH&mdash;ENGLISH COMEDY.</HEAD>
<P>COMEDY is &s;ufficiently di&s;criminated from Tragedy, by its general &s;pirit and &s;train. While pity and terror, and the other &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions form the province of the lat|ter, the chief or rather &s;ole in&s;trument of the former, is ridicule. Comedy propo&s;es for its object, neither the great &s;ufferings nor the great crimes of men; but their follies and &s;lighter vices, tho&s;e parts of their character, which rai&s;e in beholders a &s;en&s;e of impropri|ety, which expo&s;e them to be cen&s;ured, and laughed at by others, or which render them trouble&s;ome in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="366">
THIS general idea of Comedy, as a &s;ati|rical exhibition of the improprieties and fol|lies of mankind, is an idea very moral and u&s;eful. There is nothing in the nature, or general plan of this kind of Compo&s;ition, that renders it liable to cen&s;ure. To poli&s;h the manners of men, to promote attention to the proper decorums of &s;ocial behaviour, and above all, to render vice ridiculous, is doing a real &s;ervice to the world. Many vi|ces might be more &s;ucce&s;sfully exploded, by employing ridicule again&s;t them, than by &s;e|rious attacks and arguments. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that ridicule is an in&s;trument of &s;uch a nature, that when managed by un&s;kilful, or improper hands, there is hazard of its doing mi&s;chief, in&s;tead of good, to &s;ociety. For ridicule is far from being, as &s;ome have maintained it to be, a proper te&s;t of truth. On the contrary, it is apt to mi&s;lead, and &s;educe, by the colours which it throws upon its objects; and it is often more difficult to judge, whether the&s;e colours be natural and proper, than it is to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;imple truth and error. Licentious Writers, therefore, of the Comic cla&s;s, have too often have it in their power to ca&s;t a ridicule upon characters and objects which did not de&s;erve it. But this is a fault, not owing to the nature of Comedy, but to the genius and turn of the Writers of it. In the hands of a loo&s;e immoral Author, Come|dy will mi&s;lead and corrupt; while, in tho&s;e of a virtuous and well-intentioned one, it
<PB N="364" REF="367">
will be not only a gay and innocent, but a laudable and u&s;eful entertainment. French Comedy is an excellent &s;chool of manners; while Engli&s;h Comedy has been too often the &s;chool of vice.</P>
<P>THE rules re&s;pecting the Dramatic Action, which I delivered in the fir&s;t Lecture upon Tragedy, belong equally to Comedy; and hence, of cour&s;e, our di&s;qui&s;itions concerning it are &s;hortened. It is equally nece&s;&s;ary to both the&s;e forms of Dramatic Compo&s;ition, that there be a proper unity of action and &s;ubject: that the unities of time and place be, as much as po&s;&s;ible, pre&s;erved; that is, that the time of the action be brought within rea&s;on|able bounds; and the place of the action ne|ver changed, at lea&s;t, not during the cour&s;e of each Act; that the &s;everal Scenes or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive conver&s;ations be properly linked toge|ther; that the Stage be never totally evacu|ated till the Act clo&s;es; and that the rea&s;on &s;hould appear to us, why the per&s;onages, who fill up the different Scenes, enter and go off the Stage, at the time when they are made to do &s;o. The &s;cope of all the&s;e rules, I &s;howed, was to bring the imitation as near as po&s;&s;ible to probability; which is always nece&s;&s;ary, in order to any imitation giving us plea&s;ure. This rea&s;on requires, perhaps, a &s;tricter ob&s;ervance of the dramatic rules in Comedy, than in Tragedy. For the action of Comedy being more familiar to us than that of Tragedy, more like what we are accu&s;tomed
<PB N="365" REF="368">
to &s;ee in common life, we judge more ea&s;ily of what is probable, and are more hurt by the want of it. The probable and the natu|ral, both in the conduct of the &s;tory, and in the characters and &s;entiments of the per&s;ons who are introduced, are the great foundation, it mu&s;t always be remembered, of the whole beauty of Comedy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of Tragedy are not limit|ed to any country, or to any age. The Tra|gic Poet may lay his Scene, in whatever region he plea&s;es. He may form his &s;ubject upon the hi&s;tory, either of his own, or of a foreign country; and he may take it from any period that is agreeable to him, however remote in time. The rever&s;e of this holds in Comedy, for a clear and obvious rea&s;on. In the great vices, great virtues, and high pa&s;|&s;ions, men of all countries and ages re&s;emble one another; and are therefore equally &s;ub|jects for the Tragic Mu&s;e. But tho&s;e deco|rums of behaviour, tho&s;e le&s;&s;er di&s;criminati|ons of character, which afford &s;ubject for Comedy, change with the differences of countries and times; and can never be &s;o well under&s;tood by foreigners, as by natives. We weep for the heroes of Greece and Rome, as freely as we do for tho&s;e of our own country: but we are touched with the ridicule of &s;uch manners and &s;uch characters only, as we &s;ee and know; and therefore the &s;cene and &s;ubject of Comedy, &s;hould always be laid in our own country, and in our own
<PB N="366" REF="369">
times. The Comic Poet, who aims at cor|recting improprieties and follies of behaviour, &s;hould &s;tudy <Q REND="inline">"to catch the manners living as they ri&s;e."</Q> It is not his bu&s;ine&s;s to amu&s;e us with a tale of the la&s;t age, or with a Spani&s;h or a French intrigue; but to give us pictures taken from among our&s;elves; to &s;atirize reigning and pre&s;ent vices; to exhibit to the age a faithful copy of it&s;elf, with its humours, its follies, and its extravagancies. It is only by laying his plan in this manner, that he can add weight and dignity to the entertain|ment which he gives us. Plautus, it is true, and Terence, did not follow this rule. They laid the &s;cene of their Comedies in Greece, and adopted the Greek laws and cu&s;toms. But it mu&s;t be remembered, that Comedy was, in their age, but a new entertainment in Rome; and that then they contented them&s;elves with imitating, often with tran&s;|lating merely, the Comedies of Menander, and other Greek Writers. In after times, it is known that the Romans had the "Comoe|dia Togata," or what was founded on their own manners, as well as the "Comoedia Pal|liata," or what was taken from the Greeks.</P>
<P>COMEDY may be divided into two kinds; Comedy of Character, and Comedy of In|trigue. In the latter, the plot, or the action of the Play, is made the principal object. In the former, the di&s;play of &s;ome peculiar cha|racter is chiefly aimed at; the action is con|trived altogether with a view to this end,
<PB N="367" REF="370">
and is treated as &s;ubordinate to it. The French abound mo&s;t in Comedies of Cha|racter. All Moliere's capital Pieces are of this &s;ort; his Avare, for in&s;tance, Mi&s;an|thrope, Tartuffe; and &s;uch are De&s;touches's al&s;o, and tho&s;e of the other chief French Comedians. The Engli&s;h have inclined more to Comedies of Intrigue. In the Plays of Congreve, and, in general, in all our Come|dies, there is much more &s;tory, more bu&s;tle and action, than on the French Theatre.</P>
<P>IN order to give this &s;ort of Compo&s;ition its proper advantage, the&s;e two kinds &s;hould be properly mixed together. Without &s;ome intere&s;ting and well-conducted &s;tory, mere conver&s;ation is apt to become in&s;ipid. There &s;hould be always as much intrigue, as to give us &s;omething to wi&s;h, and &s;omething to fear. The incidents &s;hould &s;o &s;ucceed one another, as to produce &s;triking &s;ituations, and to fix our attention; while they afford at the &s;ame time a proper field for the exhibition of character. For the Poet mu&s;t never forget, that to exhibit characters and manners, is his principal object. The action in Comedy, though it demands his care, in order to render it animated and natural, is a le&s;s &s;ignificant and important part of the performance, than the action in Tragedy: as in Comedy, it is what men &s;ay, and how they behave, that draws our attention, rather than what they perform, or what they &s;uffer. Hence it is a great fault to overcharge it with too much
<PB N="368" REF="371">
intrigue; and tho&s;e intricate Spani&s;h plots that were fa&s;hionable for a-while, carried on by perplexed apartments, dark entries, and di&s;gui&s;ed habits, are now ju&s;tly condemned and laid a&s;ide: for by &s;uch conduct, the main u&s;e of Comedy was lo&s;t. The attention of the Spectators, in&s;tead of being directed to|wards any di&s;play of characters, was fixed upon the &s;urpri&s;ing turns and revolutions of the intrigue; and Comedy was changed into a mere Novel.</P>
<P>IN the management of Characters, one of the mo&s;t common faults of Comic Writers, is the carrying of them too far beyond life. Wherever ridicule is concerned, it is indeed extremely difficult to hit the preci&s;e point where true wit ends, and buffoonery begins. When the Mi&s;er, for in&s;tance, in Plautus, &s;earching the per&s;on whom he &s;u&s;pects for having &s;tolen his ca&s;ket, after examining fir&s;t his right hand, and then his left, cries out, <Q REND="inline">"o&s;tende etiam tertiam,"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"&s;hew me your third hand,"</Q> (a &s;troke too which Moliere has copied from him) there is no one but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the extravagance. Cer|tain degrees of exaggeration are allowed to the Comedian; but there are limits &s;et to it by nature and good ta&s;te; and &s;uppo&s;ing the Mi&s;er to be ever &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by his jealou&s;y and his &s;u&s;picions, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any man in his wits &s;u&s;pecting ano|ther of having more than two hands.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="372">
CHARACTERS in Comedy ought to be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another; but the artificial contra&s;ting of Characters, and the introducing them always in pairs, and by oppo&s;ites, gives too theatrical and affected an air to the Piece. This is become too com|mon a re&s;ource of Comic Writers, in order to heighten their Characters, and di&s;play them to more advantage. As &s;oon as the violent and impatient per&s;on arrives upon the Stage, the Spectator knows that, in the next &s;cene, he is to be contra&s;ted with the mild and good|natured man; or if one of the lovers intro|duced be remarkably gay and airy, we are &s;ure that his companion is to be a grave and &s;erious lover; like Frankly and Bellamy, Clarinda and Jacintha, in Dr. Hoadly's Su&s;|picious Hu&s;band. Such productions of Cha|racters by pairs, is like the employment of the Antithe&s;is in di&s;cour&s;e, which, as I for|merly ob&s;erved, gives brilliancy indeed upon occa&s;ions, but is too apparently a rhetorical artifice. In every &s;ort of Compo&s;ition, the perfection of art is to conceal art. A ma&s;terly Writer will therefore give us his characters, di&s;tingui&s;hed rather by &s;uch &s;hades of diver&s;ity as are commonly found in Society, than marked with &s;uch &s;trong oppo&s;itions, as are rarely brought into actual contra&s;t, in any of the circum&s;tances of life.</P>
<P>THE Style of Comedy ought to be pure, elegant, and lively, very &s;eldom ri&s;ing higher than the ordinary tone of polite conver&s;ation;
<PB N="370" REF="373">
and, upon no occa&s;ion, de&s;cending into vul|gar, mean, and gro&s;s expre&s;&s;ions. Here the French rhyme, which in many of their Co|medies they have pre&s;erved, occurs as an un|natural bondage. Certainly, if Pro&s;e belongs to any compo&s;ition whatever, it is to that which imitates the conver&s;ation of men in ordinary life. One of the mo&s;t difficult cir|cum&s;tances in writing Comedy, and one too, upon which the &s;ucce&s;s of it very much de|pends, is to maintain, throughout, a current of ea&s;y, genteel unaffected dialogue, with|out pertne&s;s and flippancy; without too much &s;tudied and un&s;ea&s;onable wit; without dul|ne&s;s and formality. Too few of our Engli&s;h Comedies are di&s;tingui&s;hed for this happy turn of conver&s;ation; mo&s;t of them are lia|ble to one or other of the exceptions I have mentioned. The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band, and, perhaps, we may add the Provoked Hu&s;|band, and the Su&s;picious Hu&s;band, &s;eem to have more merit than mo&s;t of them, for ea&s;y and natural dialogue.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief ob&s;ervations that oc|cur to me, concerning the general principles of this &s;pecies of Dramatic Writing, as di&s;|tingui&s;hed from Tragedy. But its nature and &s;pirit will be &s;till better under&s;tood, by a &s;hort hi&s;tory of its progre&s;s; and a view of the manner in which it has been carried on by Authors of different nations.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="374">
TRAGEDY is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been more ancient among the Greeks than Comedy. We have fewer lights concerning the origin and progre&s;s of the latter. What is mo&s;t probable, is, that, like the other, it took its ri&s;e accidentally from the diver&s;ions peculiar to the fea&s;t of Bacchus, and from The&s;pis and his Cart; till, by degrees, it di|verged into an entertainment of a quite dif+ferent nature from &s;olemn and Heroic Tra+gedy. Critics di&s;tingui&s;h three &s;tages of Comedy among the Greeks; which they call, the Ancient, the Middle, and the New.</P>
<P>THE Ancient Comedy con&s;i&s;ted in direct and avowed &s;atire again&s;t particular known per&s;ons, who were brought upon the Stage by name. Of this nature are the Plays of Ari&s;tophanes, eleven of which are &s;till ex|tant; Plays of a very &s;ingular nature, and wholly different from all Compo&s;itions which have, &s;ince that age born the name of Co|medy. They &s;hew what a turbulent and licentious Republic that of Athens was, and what unre&s;trained &s;cope the Athenians gave to ridicule, when they could &s;uffer the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;onages of their &s;tate, their ge|nerals, and their magi&s;trates, Cleon, Lama|chus, Nicias, Alcibiades, not to mention Socrates the Philo&s;opher, and Euripides the Poet, to be publicly made the &s;ubject of Co|medy. Several of Ari&s;tophanes's Plays are wholly political &s;atires, upon public manage|ment, and the conduct of generals and &s;tate&s;|men,
<PB N="372" REF="375">
during the Peleponne&s;ian war. They are &s;o full of political allegories and allu&s;ions, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand them without a con&s;iderable knowledge of the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times. They abound too with Parodies of the great Tragic Poets, particularly of Eu|ripides; to whom the Author was a great enemy, and has written two Comedies, al|mo&s;t wholly in order to ridicule him.</P>
<P>VIVACITY, Satire, and Buffoonry, are the characteri&s;tics of Ari&s;tophanes. Genius and force he di&s;plays upon many occa&s;ions; but his performances, upon the whole, are not calculated to give us any high opinion of the Attic ta&s;te of wit, in this age. They &s;eem, in|deed, to have been compo&s;ed for the mob. The Ridicule employed in them is extravagant; the wit for the mo&s;t part, buffooni&s;h and far|cical; the per&s;onal raillery, biting and cruel; and the ob&s;cenity that reigns in them, is gro&s;s and intolerable. The treatment given by this Comedian, to Socrates the Philo&s;opher, in his Play of "The Clouds," is well known; but however it might tend to di&s;parage So|crates in the public e&s;teem, P. Brumoy, in his Theatre Grec, makes it appear, that it could not have been, as is commonly &s;up|po&s;ed the cau&s;e of decreeing the death of that philo&s;opher, which did not happen till twenty-three years after the repre&s;entation of Ari&s;tophanes's Clouds. There is a Chorus in Ari&s;tophanes's Plays; but altogether of an irregular kind. It is partly &s;erious, partly
<PB N="373" REF="376">
comic; &s;ometimes mingles in the Action, &s;ometimes addre&s;&s;es the Spectators, defends the Author, and attacks his enemies.</P>
<P>SOON after the days of Ari&s;tophanes, the liberty of attacking per&s;ons on the Stage by name, being found of dangerous con&s;equence to the public peace was prohibited by law. The Chorus al&s;o, was at this period, bani&s;hed from the Comic Theatre, as having been an in&s;trument of too much licence and abu&s;e. Then, what is called the Middle Comedy, took ri&s;e; which was no other than an elu|&s;ion of the law. Fictitious names, indeed, were employed; but living per&s;ons were &s;till attacked; and de&s;cribed in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;ufficiently known. Of the&s;e Comic Pieces, we have no remains. To them &s;uc|ceeded the New Comedy; when the Stage being obliged to de&s;i&s;t wholly from per&s;onal ridicule, became, what it is now, the pic|ture of manners and characters, but not of particular per&s;ons. Menander was the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Author, of this kind, among the Greeks; and both from the imitations of him by Terence, and the account given of him by Plutarch, we have much rea&s;on to regret that his writings have peri&s;hed; as he appears to have reformed, in a very high degree, the public ta&s;te, and to have &s;et the model of correct, elegant, and moral Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="377">
THE only remains which we now have of the New Comedy, among the Ancients, are the Plays of Plautus and Terence; both of whom were formed upon the Greek Writers. Plautus is di&s;tingui&s;hed for very expre&s;&s;ive language, and a great degree of the Vis Co|mica. As he wrote in an early period, he bears &s;everal marks of the rudene&s;s of the Dramatic Art, among the Romans, in his time. He opens his Plays with Prologues, which &s;ometimes preoccupy the &s;ubject of the whole Piece. The repre&s;entation too, and the action of the Comedy, are &s;ometimes confounded; the Actor departing from his character, and addre&s;&s;ing the Audience. There is too much low wit and &s;currility in Plautus; too much of quaint conceit, and play upon words. But withal, he di&s;plays more variety, and more force than Terence. His charac|ters are always &s;trongly marked, though &s;ometimes coar&s;ely. His Amphytrion has been copied both by Moliere and by Dryden; and his Mi&s;er al&s;o (in the Aulularia), is the foundation of a capital Play of Moliere's, which has been once and again imitated on the Engli&s;h Stage. Than Terence, nothing can be more delicate, more poli&s;hed and ele|gant. His Style is a model of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t graceful Latinity. His dialogue is al|ways decent and correct; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, beyond mo&s;t Writers, the art of relating with that beautiful picture&s;que &s;implicity, which never fails to plea&s;e. His morality is, in ge|neral
<PB N="375" REF="378">
unexceptionable. The &s;ituations which he introduces, are often tender and intere&s;t|ing; and many of his &s;entiments touch the heart. Hence, he may be con&s;idered as the founder of that &s;erious Comedy, which has, of late years been revived, and of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion afterwards to &s;peak. If he fails in any thing, it is in &s;prightline&s;s and &s;trength. Both in his Characters, and in his Plots, there is too much &s;amene&s;s and uniformity throughout all his plays; he co|pied Menander, and is &s;aid not to have equalled him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Julius Caefar has given us his opinion of Terence, in the following lines, which are pre&s;erved in the life of Terence, a&s;cribed to Suetonius:
<Q><L>Tu quoque, tu in &s;ummis, &ocirc; dimidiate Menander,</L>
<L>Poneris, et merito, puri &s;ermonis amator;</L>
<L>Lenibus atque utinam &s;criptis adjuncta foret vis</L>
<L>Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore</L>
<L>Cum Graecis, neque in hac de&s;pectus parte jaceres;</L>
<L>Unum hoc macerer, et doleo tibi dee&s;&s;e, Terenti.</L></Q></NOTE>. In order to form a perfect Comic Author, an union would be requi&s;ite of the &s;pirit and fire of Plautus, with the grace and correctne&s;s of Terence.</P>
<P>WHEN we enter on the view of Modern Comedy, one of the fir&s;t objects which pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, is, the Spani&s;h Theatre, which has been remarkably fertile in Dramatic Pro|ductions Lopez de Vega, Guillin, and Cal|deron, are the chief Spani&s;h Comedians. Lopez de Vega, who is by much the mo&s;t famous of them, is &s;aid to have written above
<PB N="376" REF="379">
a thou&s;and Plays; and our &s;urpri&s;e at the number of his Productions will be dimini&s;h|ed, by being informed of their nature. From the account which M. Perron de Ca&s;tera, a French Writer, gives of them, it would &s;eem, that our Shake&s;peare is perfectly a regular and methodical Author, in compari&s;on of Lopez. He throws a&s;ide all regard to the Three Unities, or to any of the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of Dramatic Writing. One Play often includes many years, nay, the whole life of a man. The Scene, during the fir&s;t Act, is laid in Spain, the next in Italy, and the third in Africa. His Plays are mo&s;tly of the hi&s;to|rical kind, founded on the annals of the country; and they are, generally, a &s;ort of Tragi-comedies; or a mixture of Heroic Speeches, Serious Incidents, War and Slaugh|ter, with much Ridicule and Buffoonry. Angels and Gods, Virtues and Vices, Chri&s;|tian Religion and Pagan Mythology, are all frequently jumbled together. In &s;hort, they are Plays like no other Dramatic Compo&s;iti|ons; full of the romantic and extravagant. At the &s;ame time, it is generally admitted, that in the works of Lopez de Vega, there are frequent marks of genius, and much force of imagination; many well drawn characters, many happy &s;ituations; many &s;triking and intere&s;ting &s;urpri&s;es; and, from the &s;ource of his rich invention, the Dramatic Writers of other countries are &s;aid to have frequently drawn their materials. He him&s;elf apologi|&s;es for the extreme irregularity of his Com|po&s;ition,
<PB N="377" REF="380">
from the prevailing ta&s;te of his countrymen, who delighted in a variety of events, in &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing adventures, and a labyrinth of intrigues, much more than in a natural and regularly conducted Story.</P>
<P>THE general characters of the French Comic Theatre are, that it is correct, cha&s;te, and decent. Several Writers of con&s;iderable note it has produced, &s;uch as Regnard, Du|fre&s;ny, Dancourt, and Marivaux; but the Dramatic Author, in whom the French glory mo&s;t, and whom they ju&s;tly place at the head of all their Comedians, is, the famous Mo|liere. There is, indeed, no Author, in all the fruitful and di&s;tingui&s;hed age of Louis XIV. who has attained a higher reputation than Moliere; or who has more nearly reached the &s;ummit of perfection in his own art, according to the judgment of all the French Critics. Voltaire boldly pronounces him to be the mo&s;t eminent Comic Poet, of any age or country; nor, perhaps, is this the deci&s;ion of mere partiality; for taking him, upon the whole, I know none who de&s;erves to be preferred to him. Moliere, is always the Satiri&s;t only of vice or folly. He has &s;e|lected a great variety of ridiculous characters peculiar to the times in which he lived, and he has generally placed the ridicule ju&s;tly. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trong Comic powers; he is full of mirth and plea&s;antry; and his plea&s;antry is always innocent. His Comedies in Ver&s;e, &s;uch as the Mi&s;anthrope and Tartuffe, are a
<PB N="378" REF="381">
kind of dignified Comedy, in which vice is expo&s;ed, in the &s;tyle of elegant and polite Satire. In his Pro&s;e Comedies, though there is abundance of ridicule, yet there is never any thing found to offend a mode&s;t ear, or to throw contempt on &s;obriety and virtue. To|gether with tho&s;e high qualities, Moliere has al&s;o &s;ome defects which Voltaire, though his profe&s;&s;ed Panegyri&s;t, candidly admits. He is acknowledged not to be happy in the unra|velling of his Plots. Attentive more to the &s;trong exhibition of characters, than to the conduct of the intrigue, his unravelling is frequently brought on with too little prepa|ration, and in an improbable manner. In his Ver&s;e Comedies, he is &s;ometimes not &s;uf|ficiently intere&s;ting, and too full of long &s;peeches; and in his more ri&s;ible pieces in Pro&s;e, he is cen&s;ured for being too farcical. Few Writers, however, if any, ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed the &s;pirit, or attained the true end of Comedy, &s;o perfectly, upon the whole, as Moliere. His <HI>Tartuffe,</HI> in the &s;tyle of Grave Comedy, and his <HI>Avare,</HI> in the Gay, are ac|counted his two capital productions.</P>
<P>FROM the Engli&s;h Theatre, we are natu|rally led to expect a great variety of original characters in Comedy, and bolder &s;trokes of wit and humour, than are to be found on any other Modern Stage. Humour is, in a great mea&s;ure, the peculiar province of the Engli&s;h nation. The nature of &s;uch a free Govern|ment as ours; and that unre&s;trained liberty
<PB N="379" REF="382">
which our manners allow to every man, of living entirely after his own ta&s;te, afford full &s;cope to the di&s;play of &s;ingularity of charac|ter, and to the indulgence of humour in all its forms. Whereas, in France, the influence of a de&s;potic court, the more e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ubordination of ranks, and the univer&s;al ob&s;ervance of the forms of politene&s;s and decorum, &s;pread a much greater uniformity over the outward behaviour and characters of men. Hence Comedy has a more ample field, and can flow with a much freer vein in Britain, than in France. But it is extremely unfortunate, that, together with the freedom and boldne&s;s of the Comic &s;pirit in Britain, there &s;hould have been joined &s;uch a &s;pirit of indecency and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as has di&s;graced Engli&s;h Comedy beyond that of any nation, &s;ince the days of Ari&s;tophanes.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t age, however, of Engli&s;h Come|dy, was not infected by this &s;pirit. Neither the Plays of Shake&s;peare, nor tho&s;e of Ben. John&s;on, can be accu&s;ed of immoral tenden|cy. Shake&s;peare's general character, which I gave in the la&s;t Lecture, appears with as great advantage in his Comedies, as in his Tragedies; a &s;trong, fertile, and creative ge|nius, irregular in conduct, employed too often in amu&s;ing the mob, but &s;ingularly rich and happy in the de&s;cription of characters and manners. John&s;on is more regular in the conduct of his pieces, but &s;tiff and pedantic; though not de&s;titute of Dramatic Genius. In
<PB N="380" REF="383">
the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, much fancy and invention appear, and &s;everal beautiful pa&s;&s;ages may be found. But, in general, they abound with romantic and im|probable incidents, with overcharged and unnatural characters, and with coar&s;e and gro&s;s allu&s;ions. Tho&s;e Comedies of the la&s;t age, by the change of public manners, and of the turn of conver&s;ation, &s;ince their time, are now become too ob&s;olete to be very agree|able. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Comedy depending much on the prevailing modes of external behaviour, becomes &s;ooner antiquat|ed than any other &s;pecies of Writing; and, when antiquated, it &s;eems har&s;h to us, and lo&s;es its power of plea&s;ing. This is e&s;peci|ally the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the Comedies of our own country, where the change of man|ners is more &s;en&s;ible and &s;triking, than in any foreign production. In our country, the pre&s;ent mode of behaviour is always the &s;tandard of politene&s;s; and whatever departs from it appears uncouth; whereas, in the Writings of foreigners, we are le&s;s acquainted with any &s;tandard of this kind, and of cour&s;e, are le&s;s hurt by the want of it. Plautus appeared more antiquated to the Romans, in the age of Augu&s;tus, than he does now to us. It is a high proof of Shake&s;peare's un|common genius, that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, his character of Fal&s;taff is to this day admired, and his "Merry Wives of Wind&s;or," read with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="384">
IT was not till the aera of the Re&s;toration of King Charles II. that the licentiou&s;ne&s;s which was ob&s;erved, at that period, to infect the court, and the nation in general, &s;eized, in a peculiar manner, upon Comedy as its province, and, for almo&s;t a whole century, retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. It was then fir&s;t, that the Rake became the predominant cha|racter, and, with &s;ome exceptions, the Hero of every Comedy. The ridicule was thrown, not upon vice and folly, but much more commonly upon cha&s;tity and &s;obriety. At the end of the Play, indeed, the Rake is commonly, in appearance, reformed, and profe&s;&s;es that he is to become a &s;ober man; but throughout the play, he is &s;et up as the model of a fine gentleman; and the agreeable impre&s;&s;ion made by a &s;ort of &s;prightly licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, is left upon the imagination, as a picture of the plea&s;urable enjoyment of life; while the reformation pa&s;&s;es &s;lightly away, as a matter of form merely. To what &s;ort of moral conduct &s;uch public entertainments as the&s;e tend to form the youth of both &s;exes, may be ea&s;ily imagined. Yet this has been the &s;pirit which has prevailed upon the Comic Stage of Great Britain, not only during the reign of Charles II. but throughout the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, and down to the days of King George II.</P>
<P>DRYDEN was the fir&s;t con&s;iderable Dra|matic Writer after the Re&s;toration; in who&s;e Comedies, as in all his works, there are found

many &s;trokes of genius, mixed with great carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and vi&s;ible marks of ha&s;ty com|po&s;ition. As he &s;ought to plea&s;e only, he went along with the manners of the times; and has carried through all his Comedies that vein of di&s;&s;olute licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which was then fa&s;hionable. In &s;ome of them, the in|decency was &s;o gro&s;s as to occa&s;ion, even in that age, a prohibition of being brought upon the Stage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"The mirth which he excites in Comedy will, per|haps, be found not &s;o much to ari&s;e from any original humour, or peculiarity of character, nicely di&s;tingui&s;hed, and diligently pur&s;ued, as from incidents and circum|&s;tances, artifices and &s;urpri&s;es, from je&s;ts of action, rather than &s;entiment.

<P>SINCE his time, the Writers of Comedy, of greate&s;t note, have been Cibber, Van|burgh, Farquhar, and Congreve. Cibber has written a great many Comedies; and though, in &s;everal of them, there be much &s;prightli|ne&s;s, and a certain pert vivacity peculiar to him, yet they are &s;o forced and unnatural in the incidents, as to have generally &s;unk into ob&s;curity, except two, which have always continued in high favour with the Public, "The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band," and "The Pro|voked Hu&s;band." The former is remark|able for the polite and ea&s;y turn of the dialogue; and, with the exception of one
<PB N="383" REF="386">
indelicate Scene, is tolerably moral too in the conduct, and in the tendency. The latter, the "Provoked Hu&s;band," (which was the joint production of Vanburgh and Cibber), is, perhaps, on the whole, the be&s;t Comedy in the Engli&s;h Language. It is liable, in|deed, to one critical objection of having a double Plot; as the incidents of the Wrong|head family, and tho&s;e of Lord Townly's, are &s;eparate, and independent of each other. But this irregularity is compen&s;ated by the natural characters, the fine painting, and happy &s;trokes of humour with which it abounds. We are, indeed, &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;o unexceptionable a Comedy proceeding from two &s;uch loo&s;e Authors; for, in its general &s;train, it is calculated to expo&s;e li|centiou&s;ne&s;s and folly; and would do honour to any Stage.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN VANBURGH has &s;pirit, wit, and ea&s;e; but he is, to the la&s;t degree, gro&s;s and indelicate. He is one of the mo&s;t im|moral of all our Comedians. His "Provok'd Wife," is full of &s;uch indecent &s;entiments and allu&s;ions, as ought to explode it out of all reputable &s;ociety. His "Relap&s;e," is equally cen&s;urable; and the&s;e are his only two con&s;iderable Pieces. Congreve is, unque&s;tionably, a Writer of genius. He is lively, witty, and &s;parkling; full of character; and full of action. His chief fault as a Comic Writer, is, that he over|flows with wit. It is often introduced un|&s;ea&s;onably;

Farquhar is a light and gay Writer; le&s;s correct, and le&s;s &s;parkling than Congreve; but he has more ea&s;e; and, perhaps, fully as great a &s;hare of the Vis Comica. The two be&s;t, and lea&s;t exceptionable of his Plays, are the "Recruit|ing Officer," and the "Beaux Stratagem." I &s;ay the lea&s;t exceptionable; for, in general, the tendency of both Congreve and Farquhar's Plays is immoral. Throughout them all, the Rake, the loo&s;e intrigue, and the life of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, are the objects continually held up to view; as if the a&s;&s;emblies of a great and poli&s;hed nation could be amu&s;ed with none but vitious objects. The indelicacy of the&s;e Writers, in the female characters which they introduce, is particularly remarkable. Nothing can be more awkward than their re|pre&s;entations of a woman of virtue and ho|nour. Indeed, there are hardly any female characters in their Plays except two; women of loo&s;e principles, or women of affected manners, when they attempt to draw a cha|racter of virtue.</P>

being over&s;trained or &s;evere. Accu&s;tomed to the indelicacy of our own Comedy, and amu&s;ed with the wit and humour of it, its immo|rality too ea&s;ily e&s;capes our ob&s;ervation. But all foreigners, the French e&s;pecially, who are accu&s;tomed to a better regulated, and more decent Stage, &s;peak of it with &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment. Voltaire, who is, a&s;&s;ured|ly, none of the mo&s;t au&s;tere morali&s;ts, plumes him&s;elf not a little upon the &s;uperior <HI>bien|&s;eance</HI> of the French Theatre; and &s;ays, that the language of Engli&s;h Comedy is the lan|guage of debauchery, not of politene&s;s. M. Moralt, in his Letters upon the French and Engli&s;h Nations, a&s;cribes the corruption of manners in London to Comedy as its chief cau&s;e. Their Comedy, he &s;ays, is like that of no other country; it is the &s;chool in which the youth of both &s;exes familiari&s;e them&s;elves with vice, which is never repre&s;ented there as vice, but as mere gaiety. As for Come|dies, &s;ays the ingenious M. Diderot, in his ob&s;ervations upon Dramatic Poetry, the Eng|li&s;h have none; they have, in their place, &s;atires, full, indeed, of gaiety and force, but without morals, and without ta&s;te; <HI>&s;ans moeurs et &s;ans gout.</HI> There is no wonder, therefore, that Lord Kaims, in his Elements of Critici&s;m, &s;hould have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, upon this &s;ubject, of the indelicacy of Eng|li&s;h Comedy, in terms much &s;tronger than any that I have u&s;ed; concluding his invec|tive again&s;t it in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"How odious ought tho&s;e Writers to be, who thus &s;pread

infection through their native country; employing the talents which they have received from their Maker mo&s;t traiterou&s;ly again&s;t him&s;elf, by endeavouring to cor|rupt and disfigure his creatures. If the Comedies of Congreve did not rack him with remor&s;e, in his la&s;t moments, he mu&s;t have been lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue." <BIBL>Vol. II. 479.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I AM happy, however, to have it in my power to ob&s;erve, that of late years, a &s;en|&s;ible reformation has begun to take place in Engli&s;h Comedy. We have, at la&s;t, become a&s;hamed of making our public entertainments re&s;t wholly upon profligate characters and &s;cenes; and our later Comedies, of any repu|tation, are much purified from the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of former times. If they have not the &s;pirit, the ea&s;e, and the wit of Congreve and Farquhar, in which re&s;pect they mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;omewhat deficient; this prai&s;e, however, they ju&s;tly merit, of being innocent and moral.</P>
<P>FOR this reformation, we are que&s;tionle&s;s, much indebted to the French Theatre, which has not only been, at all times, more cha&s;te and inoffen&s;ive than ours, but has, within the&s;e few years, produced a &s;pecies of Come|dy, of &s;till a graver turn than any that I have yet mentioned. This which is called the Serious, or Tender Comedy, and was termed by its Oppo&s;ers, <HI>La Comedie Larmoyante,</HI> is
<PB N="387" REF="390">
not altogether a modern invention. Several of Terence's Plays, as the Andria, in par|ticular, partake of this character, and as we know that Terence copied Menander, we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe that his Comedies, al&s;o, were of the &s;ame kind. The nature of this Compo&s;ition, does not by any means exclude gaiety and ridicule; but it lays the chief &s;tre&s;s upon tender and intere&s;t|ing &s;ituations; it aims at being &s;entimental, and touching the heart by means of the capi|tal incidents; it makes our plea&s;ure ari&s;e, not &s;o much from the laughter which it excites, as from the tears of affection and joy which it draws forth.</P>
<P>IN Engli&s;h, Steele's Con&s;cious Lovers, is a Comedy which approaches to this character, and it has always been favourably received by the Public. In French, there are &s;everal Dramatic Compo&s;itions of this kind, which po&s;&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable merit and reputation; &s;uch as the "Melanide," and "Prejug&eacute; &agrave; la Mode," of La Chau&s;&s;&eacute;e; the "P&egrave;re de Famille," of Diderot; the "C&eacute;nie" of Mad. Graffigny; and the "Nanine," and "L'En|fant Prodigue," of Voltaire.</P>
<P>WHEN this form of Comedy fir&s;t appeared in France, it excited a great controver&s;y among the Critics. It was objected to, as a dangerous and unju&s;tifiable innovation in Compo&s;ition. It is not Comedy, &s;aid they, for it is not founded on laughter and ridicule.
<PB N="388" REF="391">
It is not Tragedy, for it does not involve us in &s;orrow. By what name then can it be called? or what preten&s;ions hath it to be comprehended under Dramatic Writing? But this was trifling, in the mo&s;t egregious man|ner, with critical names and di&s;tinctions, as if the&s;e had invariably fixed the e&s;&s;ence, and a&s;certained the limits, of every &s;ort of Com|po&s;ition. A&s;&s;uredly it is not nece&s;&s;ary that all Comedies &s;hould be formed on one preci&s;e model. Some may be entirely light and gay; others may incline more to the &s;erious; &s;ome may partake of both; and all of them, pro|perly executed, may furni&s;h agreeable and u&s;eful entertainment to the Public, by &s;uiting the different ta&s;tes of men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline">"Il y a beaucoup de tr&egrave;s bonnes pi&egrave;ces, o&ugrave; il ne regne que de la gayet&eacute;; d'autres toutes &s;eri&egrave;u&s;es; d'autres melang&eacute;es; d'autres, o&ugrave; l'attendri&s;&s;ement va ju&s;q'aux larmes. Il ne faut donner exclu&s;ion &agrave; aucune genre; &amp; &s;i l'on me demandoit, quel genre e&s;t le meilleur? Je re|pondrois, celui qui e&s;t le mieux traite." <BIBL>VOLTAIRE.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Serious and tender Comedy has no title to claim to it&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, to the exclu&s;ion of ridicule and gaiety. But when it retains only its proper place, without u&s;urping the pro|vince of any other; when it is carried on with re&s;emblance to real life, and without introducing romantic and unnatural &s;ituati|ons, it may certainly prove both an intere&s;ting and an agreeable &s;pecies of Dramatic Writ|ing. If it become in&s;ipid and drawling, this mu&s;t be imputed to the fault of the Author, not to the nature of the Compo&s;ition, which may admit much liveline&s;s and vivacity.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="392">
IN general, whatever form Comedy a&s;|&s;umes, whether gay or &s;erious, it may always be e&s;teemed a mark of Society advancing in true politene&s;s, when tho&s;e theatrical exhi|bitions, which are de&s;igned for public amu&s;e|ment, are cleared from indelicate &s;entiment, or immoral tendency. Though the licenti|ous buffoonery of Ari&s;tophanes amu&s;ed the Greeks for a while, they advanced, by de|grees, to a cha&s;ter and ju&s;ter ta&s;te; and the like progre&s;s of refinement may be concluded to take place among us, when the Public receive with favour, Dramatic Compo&s;itions of &s;uch a &s;train and &s;pirit, as entertained the Greeks and Romans, in the days of Menan|der and Terence.</P>
