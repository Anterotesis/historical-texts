<HEAD>BLACK GILES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK my readers got &s;o well acquainted la&s;t month with Black Giles the Poacher, that they will not expect, this month, to hear any great good, either of Giles him&s;elf, his wife Rachel, of any of their family. I am &s;orry to expo&s;e their tricks, but it is their fault, not mine. If I pretend to &s;peak about people at all, I mu&s;t tell the truth. I am &s;ure, if folks would but turn about and mend, it would be a thou&s;and times plea&s;anter to me to write their hi&s;|tories; for it is no comfort to tell of any body's faults. If the world would but grow good, I &s;hould be glad enough to tell of it; but till it really be|comes &s;o, I mu&s;t go on de&s;cribing it as it is; other|wi&s;e, I &s;hould only mi&s;lead my readers, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing them.</P>
<P>As to Giles and his boys, I am &s;ure old Widow Brown has good rea&s;on to remember their dexterity. Poor Woman! &s;he had a fine little bed of onions, in her neat and well-kept garden; &s;he was very fond of her onions, and many a rheumati&s;m has &s;he caught by kneeling down to weed them in a damp day, not|with&s;tanding the little flannel cloak and the bit of an old mat which Madam Wil&s;on gave her, becau&s;e the old woman would needs weed in wet weather. Her onions &s;he always carefully trea&s;ured up for her Winter's &s;tore; for an onion makes a little broth very reli&s;hing, and is indeed the only &s;avoury thing poor people are u&s;ed to get. She had al&s;o a &s;mall orchard, containing about a dozen apple trees, with which in a good year &s;he has been known to make a cou|ple of barrels of cider, which &s;he &s;old to her land|lord towards paying her rent, be&s;ides having a little
<PB N="3" REF="3">
keg which &s;he was able to keep back for her own drinking. Well! would you believe it, Giles and his boys marked both onions and apples for their own; indeed, a man who &s;tole &s;o many rabbits from the warren, was likely enough to &s;teal onions for &s;auce. One day, when the widow was abroad on a little bu&s;ine&s;s, Giles and his boys made a clear riddance of the onion bed; and when they had pulled up every &s;ingle onion, they then turned a couple of pigs into the garden, who, allured by the &s;mell, tore up the bed in &s;uch a manner, that the widow, when &s;he came home, had not the lea&s;t doubt but the pigs had been the thieves. To confirm this opinion, they took care to leave the little hatch half open at one end of the garden, and to break down a bit of a fence at the other end.</P>
<P>I wonder how any body can find in his heart not to pity and re&s;pect poor old widows! There is &s;omething &s;o forlorn and helple&s;s in their condition, that methinks it is a call on every body, men, women, and children, to do them all the kind &s;ervices that fall in their way. Surely their having no one to take their part, is an additional rea&s;on for kind|hearted people not to hurt and oppre&s;s them. But it was this very rea&s;on which led Giles to do this woman an hurt.</P>
<P>It happened unluckily for this poor widow that her cottage &s;tood quite alone. On &s;everal morn|ings together (for roguery gets up much earlier than indu&s;try) Giles and his boys &s;tole regularly into her orchard, followed by their Jack-a&s;&s;es. She was &s;o deaf that &s;he could not hear the a&s;&s;es if they had brayed ever &s;o loud, and to this Giles tru&s;t|ed; &s;o he was very cautious in his rogueries; &s;ince he could not otherwi&s;e have contrived to keep out of pri&s;on; for though he was almo&s;t always &s;u&s;pected
<PB N="4" REF="4">
he had &s;eldom been taken up, and never convicted. The boys u&s;ed to fill their bags, load their a&s;&s;es, and then march off; and if in their way to the town, where the apples were to be &s;old, they chanced to pa&s;s by one of their neighbours who might be likely to &s;u&s;pect them, they then all at once began to &s;cream out, "buy my coal!&mdash;buy my &s;and!"</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the trees in her orchard, poor Widow Brown had in her &s;mall garden one Apple-tree par|ticularly fine; it was a Red&s;treak, &s;o tempting and &s;o lovely, that Giles's family had watched it with long|ing eyes, till at la&s;t they re&s;olved on a plan for car|rying off all this fine fruit in their bags. But it was a nice point to manage. The Tree &s;tood directly un|der her chamber-window, &s;o that there was &s;ome danger that &s;he might &s;py them at the work. They therefore determined to wait till the next Sunday morning, when they knew &s;he would not fail to be at church. Sunday came, and during &s;ervice Giles attended. It was a lone hou&s;e, as I &s;aid before, and the re&s;t of the pari&s;h were &s;afe at church. In a trice the tree was cleared, the bags were filled, the a&s;&s;es were whipt, the thieves were off, the coa&s;t was clear, and all was &s;afe and quiet by the time the &s;ermon was over.</P>
<P>Unluckily, however, it happened, that this tree was &s;o beautiful, and the fruit &s;o fine, that the people, as they u&s;ed to pa&s;s to and from church, were very apt to &s;top and admire Widow Brown's Red&s;treak; and &s;ome of the farmers rather envied her that in that &s;carce &s;ea&s;on, when <HI>they</HI> hardly ex|pected to make a pye out of a large orchard, &s;he was likely to make cider from a &s;ingle tree. I am afraid indeed, if I mu&s;t &s;peak out, &s;he her&s;elf rather
<PB N="5" REF="5">
&s;et her heart too much upon this tree, and had folt as much pride as gratitude to a good providence for it; but this failing of her's was no excu&s;e for Giles. The covetou&s;ne&s;s of this thief had for once got the better of his caution; the tree was too com|pletely &s;tripped, though the younge&s;t boy Dick did beg hard that his father would leave the poor old woman enough for a few dumplings, and when Giles ordered Dick in his turn to &s;hake the tree, the boy did it &s;o gently that hardly any apples fell, for which he got a good &s;hake of the &s;tick with which the old man was beating down the apples.</P>
<P>The neighbours on their return from church &s;topped as u&s;ual, but it was&mdash;not, alas! to ad|mire the apples, for apples there were none left, but to lament the robbery, and con&s;ole the widow: mean time the Red&s;treaks were &s;afely lodged in Giles's hovel under a few bundles of hay which he had contrived to pull from the farmers mow the night before, for the u&s;e of his jack a&s;&s;es. Such a &s;tir, however, began to be made about the widow's apple-tree, that Giles, who knew how much his character laid him open to &s;u&s;picion, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the people &s;afe in church again in the afternoon, ordered his boys to carry each a hatful of the apples and thru&s;t them in at a little ca&s;ement window which happened to be open in the hou&s;e of Samuel Price, a very hone&s;t carpenter in that pari&s;h, who was at church with his whole family. Giles's plan, by this contrivance, was to lay the the&s;t on Price's &s;ons in ca&s;e the thing &s;hould come to be further enquired into. Here Dick put in a word, and begged and prayed his father not to force them to carry the apples to Price's. But all that he by his begging was
<PB N="6" REF="6">
&s;uch a knock as had nearly laid him on the earth. "What, you cowardly ra&s;cal," &s;aid Giles, "you will go and peach I &s;uppo&s;e, and get your father &s;ent to goal."</P>
<P>Poor widow Brown, though her trouble had made her &s;till weaker than &s;he was, went to church again in the afternoon; indeed &s;he rightly thought that trouble was a new rea&s;on why &s;he ought to go. During the &s;ervice &s;he tried with all her might not to think of her Red&s;treaks, and whenever they would come into her head &s;he took up her prayer book directly, and &s;o &s;he forgot them a little, and indeed &s;he found her&s;elf much ea&s;ier when &s;he came out of the church than when &s;he went in. Now it happened oddly enough, that on that Sunday, of all the Sundays in the year, &s;he &s;hould call in to re&s;t a little at Samuel Price's, to tell over again the lamentable &s;tory of the apples, and to con&s;ult with him how the thief might be brought to ju&s;|tice. But, O reader! gue&s;s if you can, for I am &s;ure I cannot tell you, what was her &s;urpri&s;e, when on going into Samuel Price's kitchen &s;he &s;aw her own Red&s;treaks lying in the window! The apples were of a &s;ort too remarkable for colour, &s;hape, and &s;ize to be mi&s;taken. There was not &s;uch ano|ther tree in the pari&s;h. Widow Brown immedia|tely &s;creamed out, "'la&s;s-a-day! as &s;ure as can be here are my Red&s;treaks; I could &s;wear to them in any court." Samuel Price, who believed his &s;ons to be as hone&s;t as him&s;elf, was &s;hocked and trou|bled at the &s;ight. He knew he had no Red&s;treaks of his own; he knew there were no apples in the window when he went to church. He did verily believe them to be the widow's. But how they came there he could not po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s. He called
<PB N="7" REF="7">
for Tom, the only one his &s;ons who now lived at home. Tom was at the Sunday &s;chool, which he had never once mi&s;&s;ed &s;ince Mr. Wil&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mini&s;ter had &s;et up one in the pari&s;h. Was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> boy likely to do &s;uch a deed?</P>
<P>A crowd was by this time got about Price <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> among which was Giles and his bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, who had already taken care to &s;pread the news that Tom Price was the thief. Mo&s;t people were unwilling to believe it. His character was very good, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> appearances were &s;trongly again&s;t him. Mr. Wil|&s;on, who had &s;taid to chri&s;ten a child, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in. He was much concerned that Tom Price, the be&s;t boy in his &s;chool, &s;hould &s;tand accu&s;ed of &s;uch a crime. He &s;ent for the boy, examined, and cro&s;s examined him. No marks of guilt appeared. But &s;till though he pleaded <HI>not guilty,</HI> there lay the Red&s;treaks in his father's window. All the idle fellows in the place, who were likely to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|mitted &s;uch a theft them&s;elves, fell with great ven|geance on poor Tom. The wicked &s;eldom give any quarter. "This is one of your &s;anctified ones!" cried they. "This was all the good that Sunday &s;chools did! For their parts they never &s;aw any good come by religion. Sunday was the only day for a little pa&s;time, and if poor boys mu&s;t be &s;hut up with their godly books when they ought to be out taking a little plea&s;ure, it was no won|der they made, them&s;elves amends by &s;uch tricks." Another &s;aid, he &s;hould like to &s;ee par&s;on Wil&s;on's righteous one well whipped. A third hoped he would be clapped in the &s;tocks for a young hypo|crite as he was, while old Giles, who thought to avoid &s;u&s;picion by being more violent than the re&s;t, declared, "that he hoped, the young dog would be tran&s;ported for life."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
Mr. Wil&s;on was too wi&s;e and too ju&s;t to proceed again&s;t Tom without full proof. He declared the crime was a very heavy one, and he feared that heavy mu&s;t be the puni&s;hment. Tom, who knew his own innocence, earne&s;tly prayed to GOD that it might be made to appear as dear as the noon-day, and very &s;ervent were his &s;ecret devotions on that night.</P>
<P>Black Giles pa&s;&s;ed his night in a very different manner. He &s;et off as &s;oon as it was dark with his &s;ons and their jack-a&s;&s;es laden with their &s;tolen goods. As &s;uch a cry was rai&s;ed about the apples he did not think it &s;afe to keep them longer at home, but re&s;olved to go and &s;ell them at the next town; borrowing without leave a lame colt out of the moor to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying off his booty.</P>
<P>Giles and his elde&s;t &s;ons had rare &s;port all the way in thinking, that while they were enjoying the profit of their plunder, Tom Price would be whip|ped round the market place at lea&s;t, if not &s;ent be|yond &s;ea. But the younger boy Dick, who had naturally a tender heart, though hardened by his long familiarity with &s;in, could not help crying when he thought that Tom Price might perhaps be tran&s;ported for a crime which he him&s;elf had help|ed to commit. He had had no compunction about the robbery, for he had not been in&s;tructed in the great principles of truth and ju&s;tice. Nor would he therefore, perhaps, have had much remor&s;e about accu&s;ing an innocent boy. But though ut|terly devoid of principle he had &s;ome remains of natural feeling and of gratitude. Tom Price had often given him a bit of his own bread and chee&s;e; and once, when Dick was like to be drowned, Tom had jumped into the pond with his cloaths on and &s;aved his life when he was ju&s;t &s;inking: the
<PB N="9" REF="9">
remembrance of all this made his heart heavy. He &s;aid nothing: as he trotted bare foot after the a&s;&s;es he heard his father and brothers laugh at having outwitted the godly ones; and he grieved to think how poor Tom would &s;uffer for his wickedne&s;s, yet &s;ear kept him &s;ilent; they called him &s;ulky dog, and la&s;hed the a&s;&s;es till they bled.</P>
<P>In the mean time Tom Price kept up his &s;pirits as well as he could. He worked hard all day, and prayed heartily night and morning. "It is true," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I am not guilty of this &s;in; but let this accu&s;ation &s;et me on examining my|&s;elf, and truly repenting of all my other &s;ins, for I find enough to repent of, though I thank God I did not &s;teal tho&s;e apples."</P>
<P>At length Sunday came. Tom went to &s;chool as u&s;ual. As &s;oon as he walked in there was a deal of whi&s;pering and laughing among the wor&s;t of the boys; and he over heard them &s;ay, "Who would have thought it? This is ma&s;ter's favourite! This is Par&s;on Wil&s;on's &s;ober Tommy! We &s;han't have Tommy thrown in our teeth again if we go to get a bird's ne&s;t, or gather a few nuts of a Sunday." "Your demure ones are always hypo|crites," &s;ays another. "The &s;till &s;ow &s;ucks all the milk," &s;ays a third.</P>
<P>Giles's family had always kept clear of the &s;chool. Dick indeed had &s;ometimes wi&s;hed to go, not that he had much &s;en&s;e of &s;in, or de&s;ire af|ter goodne&s;s, but he thought if he could once read, he might ri&s;e in the world, and not be forced to drive a&s;&s;es all his life. Through this whole Saturday night he could not &s;leep. He longed to know what would be done to Tom. He began to wi&s;h to go to &s;chool, but he had not courage; &s;in is very
<PB N="10" REF="10">
cowardly; &s;o on the Sunday morning he went and &s;at him&s;elf down under the church wall. Mr. Wil&s;on pa&s;&s;ed by. It was not his way to reject the mo&s;t wicked, till he had tried every means to bring them over, and even then he pitied and prayed for them. He had indeed long left off talking to Giles's, &s;ons; but &s;eeing Dick &s;itting by him&s;elf he once more &s;poke to him, de&s;ired him to leave off his vagabond life, and go with him into the &s;chool. The boy hung down his head, but made no an&s;wer. He did not however either ri&s;e up and run away, or look &s;ulky, as he u&s;ed to do. The Mini&s;ter de&s;ired him once more. "Sir," &s;aid the boy, "I can't go; I am &s;o big I am a&s;ham|ed." "The bigger you are the le&s;s time you have to lo&s;e." "But, Sir, I can't read." "Then it is high time you &s;hould learn." "I &s;hould be a|&s;hamed to begin to learn my letters." "The &s;hame is not in beginning to learn them, but in be|ing contented never to know them." "But, Sir, I am &s;o ragged!" God looks at the heart and not at the coat. "But, Sir, I have no &s;hoes and &s;tockings." "So much the wor&s;e. I remember who gave you both," (here Dick coloured.) "It is bad to want &s;hoes and &s;tockings, but &s;till if you can drive your a&s;&s;es a dozen miles without them, you may certainly walk to &s;chool without them." "But, Sir, the good boys will hate me, and won't &s;peak to me." "Good boys hate nobody, and as to not &s;peaking to you, to be &s;ure they will not keep you company while you go on in your pre|&s;ent evil cour&s;es; but as &s;oon as they &s;ee you wi&s;h to reform, they will help you, and pity you, and teach you, and &s;o come along." Here Mr. Wil&s;on took this dirty boy by the hand, and gently pulled him forward, kindly talking to him all the way.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">
How the whole &s;chool &s;tared to &s;ee Dick Giles come in! No one however dared to &s;ay what he thought. The bu&s;ine&s;s went on, and Dick &s;lunk into a corner, partly to hide his rags and partly to hide his &s;in, for la&s;t Sunday's tran&s;action &s;at heavy at his heart, not becau&s;e be had &s;tolen the apples, but becau&s;e Tom Price had been accu&s;ed. This I &s;ay, made him &s;link behind. Poor boy! he little thought there was ONE &s;aw him who &s;ees all things, and from whole eye no hole nor corner can hide the &s;inner.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom in that &s;chool for the ma&s;ter, who was a good and wi&s;e man, to mark down in his pocket book all the events of the week, that he might turn them to &s;ome account in his Sunday evening in&s;tructions, &s;uch as any u&s;eful &s;tory in the new&s;paper, any account of boys being drowned as they were out in a plea&s;ure-boat on Sundays; any &s;udden death in the pari&s;h, or any other remark|able vi&s;itation of Providence, in&s;omuch, that many young people in the place, who did not belong to the &s;chool, and many parents al&s;o, u&s;ed to drop in for an hour on a Sunday evening, when they were &s;ure to hear &s;omething profitable. The Mi|ni&s;ter greatly approved this practice, and often cal|led in him&s;elf, which was a great &s;upport to the ma&s;ter, and encouragement to the people.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter had taken a deep concern in the &s;tory of widow Brown's apple-tree. He could not believe Tom Price was guilty, nor dared he pro|nounce him innocent; but he re&s;olved to turn the in&s;tructions of the pre&s;ent evening to this &s;ubject. He began thus: "My dear boys, however light &s;ome of you may make of robbing an orchard, yet I have often told you there is no &s;uch thing as
<PB N="12" REF="12">
a <HI>little</HI> &s;in, if it be wilful or habitual. I wi&s;h now to explain to you al&s;o that there is hardly &s;uch a thing as a <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> &s;olitary &s;in. You know I teach you not merely to repeat the command|ments as an exerci&s;e for your memory, but as a rule for your conduct. If you were to come here only to learn to read and &s;pell on a Sunday, I &s;hould think that was not employing. God's day for God's work; but I teach you to read that you may by this means come &s;o to under&s;tand the Bi|ble and the Catechi&s;m, as to make every text in the one, and every que&s;tion and an&s;wer in the other, to be &s;o fixed in your hearts, that they may bring forth the fruits of good living.</P>

<P>This was the only part of the ca&s;e in which poor Dick Giles's heart did not &s;inite him; for he knew that he had di&s;obeyed no father; for his father, alas! was &s;till wickeder than him&s;elf, and had brought him to commit the &s;in. But what a wretched comfort was this! The ma&s;ter went on.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;e this boy earne&s;tly coveted this fruit, though it belonged to another per&s;on, would that be right?</P>

<P>No, ma&s;ter; for the tenth commandment &s;ays. <HI>Thou &s;halt not covet.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. Here are four of God's
<PB N="14" REF="14">
po&s;itive commands already broken. Now do you think thieves ever &s;cruple to u&s;e wicked words?</P>

<P>I am afraid not, ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>Here Dick Giles was not &s;o hardened but that he remembered how many cur&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and his father while they were filling the bags, and he was afraid to look up. The ma&s;ter went on.</P>
<P>"I will now go one &s;tep further. If the thief, to all his other &s;ins has added that of accu&s;ing the innocent to &s;ave him&s;elf, if he &s;hould break the ninth commandment, by <HI>bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t a harmle&s;s neighbour,</HI> SIX COMMANDMENTS ARE BROKEN FOR AN APPLE! But if it be otherwi&s;e, if Tom Price &s;hould be found guilty, 'tis not his good character &s;hall &s;ave him. I &s;hall &s;hed tears over him, but puni&s;h him I mu&s;t"&mdash;"No, that you &s;han't," roared out Dick Giles, who &s;prung from his hiding place, fell on his knees, and bur&s;t out a crying, "Tom Price is as good a boy as ever lived; it was fa|ther and I &s;tole the apples!"</P>
<P>It would have done your heart good to have &s;een the joy of the ma&s;ter, the mode&s;t blu&s;hes of Tom Price, and the &s;atisfaction of every hone&s;t boy in the &s;chool. All &s;hook hands with Tom, and even Dick got &s;ome portion of pity. I wi&s;h I had room to give my readers the moving exhortation which the ma&s;ter gave. But while Mr. Wil&s;on left the guilty boy to the management of the ma&s;ter, he thought it became him, as a Mini&s;ter and a Magi&s;|trate, to go to the extent of the law in puni&s;hing the father. Early on the Monday morning he &s;ent to apprehend Giles; in the mean time Mr. Wil&s;on was &s;ent for to a gardener's hou&s;e two miles di&s;tant, to attend a man who was dying. This was a duty to
<PB N="15" REF="15">
which all others gave way in his mind. He &s;et out directly, but what was his &s;urpri&s;e on his arrival to &s;ee, on a littlebed on the floor, poaching Giles lying in all the agonies of death! Jack We&s;ton, the &s;ame poor young man again&s;t whom Giles had informed for killing a hare, was kneeling by him, offering him &s;ome broth, and talking to him in the kinde&s;t man|ner, Mr. Wil&s;on begged to know the meaning of all this, and Jack We&s;ton &s;poke as follow.</P>
<P>"At four this morning, as I was going out to now, pa&s;&s;ing under the high wall of this garden I heard a mo&s;t di&s;mal moaning. The nearer I came the more di&s;mal it grew. At la&s;t, who &s;hould I &s;ee but poor Giles groaning, and &s;truggling under a quantity of bricks and &s;tones, but not able to &s;tir. The day before he had marked a fine large net on this old wall, and re&s;olved to &s;teal it, for he thought it might do as well to catch partridges as to pre&s;erve cherries; &s;o, Sir, &s;tanding on the very top of this wall, and tugging with all his might to loo&s;en the net from the hooks which fa&s;tened it, down came Giles, net, wall and all, for the wall was gone to de|cay. It was very high indeed, and poor Giles not only broke his thigh, but has got a terrible blow on his brain, and is brui&s;ed all over like a mummy. On &s;eeing me, Sir, poor Giles cried out, 'oh Jack! I did try to ruin thee by lodging that information, and now thou wilt be revenged by letting me lie here and peri&s;h. God forbid, Gil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cried I: thou &s;halt &s;ee what &s;ort of revenge a Chri&s;tian takes. So, Sir, I &s;ent off the gardener's boy to fetch a &s;urgeon, while I &s;campered home, and brought on my back this bit of a hammock, which is indeed my own bed, and put Giles upon it, we then lifted him up, bed and all, as tenderly as if he had been a gentleman, and brought him in here. My wife has ju&s;t brought
<PB N="16" REF="16">
him a drop of nice broth, and now, Sir, as I have done what I could for his poor peri&s;hing body. It was I who took the liberty to &s;end to you to come to try to help his poor &s;oul, for the Doctor &s;ays he can't live."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on could not help &s;aying to him&s;elf, "Such an action as this is worth a whole volume of comments on that precept of our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;|ter, 'Do good to them that hate you." Giles's dying groans confirmed the &s;ad account We&s;ton had ju&s;t given. The poor wretch could neither pray him&s;elf, nor attend to the Mini&s;ter. He could only cry out, "Oh, Sir, what will become of me? I don't know how to repent. Oh my poor wicked children! Sir, I have bred them all up in &s;in and ignorance. Have mercy on them, Sir; let me not meet than in the place of torment to which I am going." He langui&s;hed a few days, and died in great mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Except the Mini&s;ter and Jack We&s;ton, no one came to &s;ee poor Giles, be&s;ides Tommy Price, who had been &s;o &s;adly wronged by him. Tom often brought him his own rice milk or apple dumpling, and Giles, ignorant and depraved as he was, often cried out, that he thought now there mu&s;t be &s;ome truth in religion, &s;ince it taught even a boy to <HI>deny him&s;elf,</HI> and to <HI>forgive an injury.</HI>&mdash;Mr. Wil&s;on the next Sunday made a moving di&s;cour&s;e on the dan|ger of what are called "petty offences." This together with the awful death of Giles, produced &s;uch an effect, that no Poacher has been able to &s;hew his head in that pari&s;h ever &s;ince.</P>
