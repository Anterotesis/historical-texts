<P>IT is particularly reque&s;ted that the follow|ing Addre&s;s to the Public, may not be read till after a peru&s;al of the work it&s;elf; for, though it is not intended as a key, no &s;uch thing being nece&s;&s;ary, it is &s;o far a &s;ort of elucidation, that a previous knowledge of it might &s;erve, by anticipating &s;ome of the circum&s;tances, to take off the edge of the reader's curio&s;ity; which, be it as keen as it may, will often be whetted in the cour&s;e of his acquaintance with Hannah Hewit.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Readers of Hannah Hewit, having been reque&s;ted to &s;uppo&s;e that her life was written by her&s;elf, are now en|treated to go on and &s;uppo&s;e a little more; and fir&s;t, that her brother, Captain Higgins, to whom Hewit's che&s;t was given in care, was &s;hipwrecked and lo&s;t, in his pa&s;&s;age home, on one of the Scilly I&s;lands; and that the cargo and different effects of the Dane, and of cour&s;e Hewit's che&s;t, fell a prey to the fi&s;hermen, &s;mugglers, and other uncivilized boors who inhabit tho&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Let me then intrude for a further &s;uppo&s;ition that Hewit's che&s;t, having been thrown among &s;ome lumber in a cellar, was di&s;covered, eight years afterwards, by a Grub-&s;treet Poet; who, tired out by a long &s;eries of li|terary di&s;appointments, turned mi&s;anthrope, and went to re&s;ide in that ob&s;cure part of the world.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ed, permit me to make intere&s;t for one more &s;uppo&s;ition, that by &s;ome circuitous route, no mat|ter what, the whole of the&s;e materials came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that I found them a large, loo&s;e, indige&s;ted
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
ma&s;s; that I &s;eperated, methodized, and regulated them, and that they are now given to the public in that form which I thought would be mo&s;t acceptable.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, let me tell the reader, are not ami&s;s: Fir&s;t, if Captain Higgins, notwith&s;tanding his boa&s;ted &s;ecurity and implicit reliance on the wind, was ca&s;t away, what cau&s;e would there be to admire the pre|&s;cience of Hannah Hewit, who warned him again&s;t taking the voyage, and actually prevailed on &s;even other per&s;ons to &s;tay with her, thereby &s;aving their lives.</P>
<P>Next, the &s;uppo&s;ition that Hewit's che&s;t, filled with manu&s;cripts, &s;hould be thrown about like lumber among a &s;et of people who could not read, is really neat enough; and, again, it is not only ingenious to &s;ay an author &s;hould be the fir&s;t to re&s;cue them from oblivion, but it is fairly in point, being poor, that he &s;hould wi&s;h to get &s;omething by them. The only wonder is, that he did not pa&s;s them for his own; except, indeed, we believe that they are his invention, and that, as lady writing is now very fa&s;hiona|ble, he thought it his intere&s;t to foi&s;t them upon Hannah, but this la&s;t will not do, for it knocks up the other &s;up|po&s;itions.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, that this work, by &s;ome means or other, came into my hands, is not to be &s;o ea&s;ily cleared;
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
for, account for it how I may, it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould every where gain credit. My readers, therefore, for I hope there will be a great many, and I am &s;ure they will all be candid and kind, having &s;o hand&s;omely indulged me with &s;everal &s;uppo&s;itions for my accommo|dation, are re&s;pectfully reque&s;ted, on this &s;ubject, to add a &s;uppo&s;ition for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the mean time I &s;hall &s;peak of this work as if I ex|pected implicit belief that it was found in Hewit's che&s;t, not that I mean to &s;ay, I ever &s;aw Hewit's che&s;t, for that would be as times go, rather too tickli&s;h an a&s;&s;ertion. No, no, I only &s;peak of the manu&s;cripts. The che&s;t was left as a memento on the Scilly I&s;land; which undoubted fact, if this hi&s;tory were of con&s;equence enough to make &s;uch a &s;tir about it, I could procure to be authenticated by the &s;ignatures of the par&s;on, and churchwardens, and the marks of the over&s;eers, and half the inhabitants.</P>
<P>But I am afraid I am wrong; and by appearing &s;o an|xious to e&s;tabli&s;h this fact, like the old woman who &s;wept the du&s;t about the hou&s;e till &s;he lo&s;t it, it will be &s;u&s;pected of being no fact at all. I &s;hall, therefore, take bolder ground and &s;ay, that &s;o far from not being po&s;&s;ible, the thing is very likely.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="7">
Don't we know that Don Quixote, in&s;tead of being written by Cervantes, was found, and I believe in a che&s;t, among the writings of Cid Hamet Benanjulo? Were not, to our certain knowledge, the entire works of Ari&s;totle, as I had occa&s;ion largely to illu&s;trate in the Preface to my other Novel, buried in the earth for two hundred and &s;eventy years, and afterwards known to be genuine?</P>
<P>Will any body, after this, tell me that I need make my&s;elf unea&s;y, that &s;uch a trifling work &s;hould have been found in a che&s;t only eight years after it was depo&s;ited there? And in what che&s;t too? A &s;eaman's che&s;t. What is a &s;eaman without his che&s;t? What &s;o likely to be found after a &s;hipwreck? Where is it more probable that a &s;hip &s;hould be wrecked than on the Scilly I&s;lands? For my part I think it would be impertinence to offer another proof.</P>
<P>Let it, however, be remembered, that the pains I have taken have been &s;olely on my own account. I have no wi&s;h in this bu&s;ine&s;s to get into any public controver&s;y: 'Let every tub,' or rather che&s;t, '&s;tand upon its own bot|tom.' I cannot help, however, confe&s;&s;ing that it will be an un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction to me to find that in elu|cidating the truth of my own argument, I &s;hall have been
<PB N="v" REF="8">
fortunate enough to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm the world's be|lief of any &s;imilar fact; or, which expre&s;&s;ion is, I believe, more fa&s;hionable&mdash;Fac &s;imile.</P>
<P>Having now &s;o po&s;itively proved how this hi&s;tory was found, I &s;hall go on to &s;hew, fir&s;t, the probability of its having been written by Hannah Hewit, and, &s;econdly, how far as to its circum&s;tances it is entitled to implicit credit from the public.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t con&s;ideration&mdash;If Hannah Hewit did not write this book, will the reader have the kindne&s;s to tell me who did? This, I think, is unan&s;werable. Indeed, who but &s;he could have given &s;o minute and particular an account of all that happened, both before and during the time &s;he was &s;ecluded from the world. Who could have broached her opinions, explained her re&s;ources, or entered, as it were, into the rece&s;&s;es of her heart, but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is a vein all the way through, I will not &s;ay of egoti&s;m, for Hannah was above being tainted with vanity, but of that laudable ambition, which all men and women too entertain, to &s;et up in their own example, a model for the world's imitation: and which cannot be given in co|lours
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
&s;o glowing from the pen of any other as the per&s;on by whom it is felt.</P>
<P>I believe it will be given me, that this propen&s;ity pre|vails throughout human nature; and that there is no re|gular &s;y&s;tem, be it cock fighting, love, eating, reform, &s;wearing, dre&s;&s;ing, bamming, &s;impering, lounging, back|biting, or whatever el&s;e may happen to be the reigning plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s of the moment, but &s;ome &s;on or daughter of creation is emulous to hold out as a worthy example to his or her fellow creatures.</P>
<P>If Hannah could have had a foible, I think it would have been this: Her intellects were &s;trong, her invention prompt, and her conclu&s;ions found and ju&s;t. Added to exqui&s;ite feminine &s;u&s;eeptibility, &s;he had a male mind. In &s;hort, &s;he had tho&s;e requi&s;ites without which no female can be ab&s;olutely a writer; and if the&s;e deceived her into an opinion that a moral application would be made of her work, and that under the idea of doing good for evil, &s;he &s;hould do a great deal to plea&s;e a world that had done a great deal to vex her, the error will, of cour&s;e, be pardoned in favour of the intention.</P>
<P>Having as completely proved that Hannah wrote her
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
own life, as that it was found in Hewit's che&s;t, I &s;hall go into the probability of its being authentic; and, then, after a few conclu&s;ive remarks, take my leave of the reader.</P>
<P>As to the authenticity of this work for my own part, were I not &s;o &s;ituated as to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking to it in &s;ome degree, I &s;hould be wholly &s;ilent; for whenever I take up a book, &s;o the matter is entertain|ing, and the &s;entiments are ju&s;t, it is perfectly indifferent to me whether they are conveyed through the medium of fact or fiction; and as to the pre&s;ent &s;ubejct, having never, to the be&s;t of my recollection, &s;een any more of Mrs. Hewit than of her hu&s;band's che&s;t, it would not only be propo&s;terous folly, but an in&s;ult to the public, which no Hannah Hewit &s;hall ever catch me at, were I to pledge my&s;elf to the literal truth of a &s;ingle iota throughout the whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am, neverthele&s;s, &s;trongly inclined to believe that this hi&s;tory is, at lea&s;t, e&s;&s;entially true: for there are many of the circum&s;tances, the &s;imilarity of which I recognize correctly, and I &s;hould be very apt to pin an implicit faith upon the whole exactly as it is here &s;et down, were it not that the&s;e per&s;ons, and the&s;e circum&s;tances, are cut out now and then and fitted &s;o as to an&s;wer a judicious pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="viii" REF="11">
in&s;tead of being &s;uffered to &s;tand in their original character and form.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, I once knew a man &s;o extremely like Sourby, that I defy Hannah Hewit to bring forward any plan of dome&s;tic ruin her Sourby ever meditated, but I'll match with one fabricated by mine. Indeed I &s;hould fancy them one and the &s;ame per&s;on, if it was not that her Sourby was &s;wallowed by a &s;hark, whereas I met mine the other day lolling in his chariot,</P>
<P>The conduct of every nefarious lawyer is &s;o alike, that it is not wonderful, having, as Walme&s;ley would have &s;aid, &s;een &s;ome de&s;perate &s;ervice, that I &s;hould know the exact repre&s;entative of Lawyer Higgins. The fact is, one trifling difference excepted, I could point at the man, which difference is only this, that Hannah's lawyer was hanged at Tyburn, whereas mine is not hanged yet.</P>
<P>By circum&s;tances like the&s;e I am now and then given to believe that in the fulne&s;s of her zeal, Hannah &s;ome|times bounced, that is to &s;ay, poetically, and &s;he was right; for, if it be true, which it is, and a lamentable con&s;ideration into the bargain, that vice is &s;eldomer pu|ni&s;hed than moral ju&s;tice requires, it is fairly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the poet, occa&s;ionally, to call in a &s;hark, or a halter,
<PB N="ix" REF="12">
that a literary work may go in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o the world not only to encourage the virtues of the good, but to gnaw and choke the con&s;ciences of the bad.</P>
<P>But to continue my examination. I knew the man and have a good rea&s;on to remember him, who under the title of Captain Higgins, performed that exploit in the Britannia, and afterwards commanded the Eagle: all which, as well as the Vigo bu&s;ine&s;s, his being cheated by his merchants, his going to the Fleet, and afterwards to India, and many other things are to my knowledge li|terally true.</P>
<P>If it were nece&s;&s;ary; I might next go into the good na|tured thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of Walme&s;ley, the weakne&s;s that perpetually betrayed Hewit into indi&s;cretion, the un|affected manline&s;s of Binns, and the fine mind of young Hewit, and &s;ay that I virtually knew every one of them; for though I have been pretty roughly treated in the world as well as Hanah, I have &s;till a plea&s;ure and a willingne&s;s to confe&s;s that &s;uch characters are to be found. The misfortune is, that being, in the garden of life, though a very beautiful, yet a very humble plant, they are &s;o choked up, and trampled upon, that it requires both &s;ound judgment and keen penetration to di&s;cover them; and, even then, they are &s;o warped and di&s;torted, that
<PB N="x" REF="13">
they &s;eldom di&s;play their native &s;weetne&s;s and beauty, except when nurtured in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations may &s;erve to convince the reader that the characters are drawn in the &s;pirit of truth. It will be only nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to &s;ee whether the in|cidents in this hi&s;tory are brought about by probable means, which I &s;hall certainly not &s;hrink from; but it mu&s;t appear rea&s;onable to any one that I ought here to have a large latitude. If circum&s;tances ari&s;e from others which, though they are in their nature improbable, we ac|tually know may and do occa&s;ionally happen, the ground of tho&s;e circum&s;tances being &s;trong, the circum&s;tances will be &s;trong al&s;o.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, when a &s;hip is underweigh, upon ever &s;o long, or ever &s;o hazardous a voyage, how infinite the odds are that &s;he is not ca&s;t away, therefore a &s;hipwreck is a very improbable thing; but we know that &s;hips have been ca&s;t away, and that the Gro&s;venor Ea&s;t India|man was one of them; and we al&s;o know that the crew and pa&s;&s;engers &s;uffered unheard of hard&s;hips. This is one of the &s;trong con&s;equences I allude to, which, though not prima facie, a probability, is both as probable and as, natural a con&s;equence as the commone&s;t deduction from the commone&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="14">
It is upon this principle that I would guard the rea|der from fancying, that though upon the fir&s;t blu&s;h there may appear &s;omething of the extravaganza in this work, there is nothing of the marvellous; and though I &s;hall take but little time in doing &s;o, I don't de&s;pair of bringing home to the conviction of the reader a broad and liberal probability, even to the &s;ame degree that I believe it my|&s;elf, that the work, as I &s;aid before, is e&s;&s;entially true.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that I adverti&s;ed this work as the hi&s;tory of a woman of uncommon, mental and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments. The latter the reader has a better right to credit than ever reader had to credit the beauty of any heroine yet recorded; for, though a woman, and writing her own hi&s;tory, &s;he does not at any one time tell you whe|ther &s;he was tall, or &s;hort, or fair, or brown, whether her favourite mode of doing execution was by an ogle, a &s;mile, a &s;igh, a li&s;p, a pat, a loll, a leer, or a trip, but leaves for proof the force of her charms to the impre&s;&s;ion they made on her various admirers, from Sourby to the monkies. The word uncommon is, therefore, the mo&s;t proper epithet I could have cho&s;en.</P>
<P>But if Hannah is &s;ilent on her per&s;onal accompli&s;h|ments, &s;he pays it off by de&s;cribing tho&s;e of her mind, even to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nutie; not, however, that &s;he would have done this
<PB N="xii" REF="15">
had it not been po&s;itively nece&s;&s;ary, for let an indifferent per&s;on take up the meane&s;t article made by the meane&s;t artiza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, and, but that it is cu&s;tomary to &s;ee &s;uch articles con&s;tantly before his eyes, he would think it was per|formed by miracle. Her difficulty, therefore, was to prove that one per&s;on could do &s;o much, but I can, in my mind, very ea&s;ily get over this.</P>
<P>The principle of every thing is almo&s;t exactly alike, and the comprehen&s;ion that can clearly and correctly ad|mit this in one in&s;tance, will, by per&s;everence, find little difficulty to admit it in every in&s;tance. Thus the principle learnt, an active mind has nothing to do but to fa&s;hion and vary it, and every thing in time may be accompli&s;hed, e&s;|pecially with tho&s;e who have &s;trength of conception enough to teach them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I will illu&s;trate this, for I cannot make out my po&s;i|tion too forcibly, by a very extraordinary in&s;tance. When I was in Beverly, in York&s;hire, I enquired for a per&s;on to tune a piano forte, I was told that the organi&s;t was out of town, but they could &s;end for Quiz. Being the fir&s;t time I ever heard the word, and I would not lay a wager that it was not its origin, I was curious to know who they meant by Quiz, when I learnt that the per&s;on in que&s;tion was a journeyman taylor, of the name of Oliver,
<PB N="xiii" REF="16">
who had occa&s;ionally worked at every &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s, till at la&s;t having been captivated by mu&s;ic, like the man who was determined to learn Boyer's dictionary by heart, by way of teaching him&s;elf French, he thought he &s;hould get at the whole &s;cience of mu&s;ic through the medium of tuning piano fortes.</P>
<P>I found Quiz a much more extraordinary creature than he was de&s;cribed, for I was curious, and he was commu|nicative; without knowing any thing &s;y&s;tematically, it is a&s;toni&s;hing what conclu&s;ions he had formed by going over again and again the different di&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary for tuning an in&s;trument; and then every thing he u&s;ed he had made him&s;elf. Not having money enough to buy a tuning hammer, he actually took the &s;tand of his goo&s;e to a black&s;mith's &s;hop and &s;haped one out of it, which I &s;aw, and it an&s;wered the purpo&s;e even better than tuning hammers in general.</P>
<P>But this is nothing. Two or three patents had been procured for inventions of his &s;ugge&s;tion. One was for clothing of death-head buttons, a machine for the perfor|mance of which having &s;een that cloathed four buttons at a time, he made the man a model for one that would cloath forty, who took this friendly advantage of the poor fellow's ingenuity. In &s;hort, there is nothing in
<PB N="xiv" REF="17">
mechanics that he could not have undertaken with &s;uc|ce&s;s; and had he been in the &s;ituation of Hannah Hewit, I have no doubt but he could have accompli&s;hed every thing &s;he accompli&s;hed, and yet he was in every other re&s;pect illiterate and uninformed, what wonder then that &s;he &s;hould do all &s;he tells us, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many &s;u|perior advantages.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hing ingenuity of Hannah Hewit being completely got over, I &s;hall now examine the incidents in her hi&s;tory, and, fir&s;t, I believe, it will be allowed me that there is nothing in the three fir&s;t books that bears the &s;lighte&s;t hue of improbability. I &s;hall, however, men|tion the bu&s;ine&s;s of her predicting the fate of France, becau&s;e it will be &s;aid by tho&s;e who, let me take what pains I may will &s;till believe this book to be my inven|tion, 'that it is ea&s;y to prophecy a thing after it has happened.' To all &s;uch I an&s;wer, that if I could my&s;elf have predicted the fate of France nineteen years ago, why could not Hannah Hewit? Nay, I did predict it. So, no doubt, did the Duke of Dor&s;et, &s;o did Count Dillon, who&s;e reputations were &s;tained by the in&s;idious whi&s;pers of that mon&s;ter D'Orieans.</P>
<P>So I am &s;ure did the Emper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r. He would never have refu&s;ed to marry a woman who in her death proved her&s;elf an honour to her &s;ex, and to human nature, had
<PB N="xv" REF="18">
he not feared that by a clo&s;er alliance with France, he &s;hould intail mi&s;ery on his own &s;ubjects. While they went no further, than wearing cloaths the colour of the Queen's hair, he con&s;idered it as gallantry and a compliment to his amiable &s;i&s;ter, but when they wore the Emperor's eyes, he began to look about him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he came determined to know the character of the French thoroughly; for this he came incog, for this he mixed with every order of the people, and by this he &s;o completely di&s;covered a &s;pirit of revolt, hid like a &s;mothered &s;park, throughout the kingdom, that as an in&s;tance of it, when he was at Nanci, in Lorraine, had he hinted &s;uch a wi&s;h, they would once more have cut off that province from France, and hailed him its Prince.</P>
<P>Every thing, after the Gro&s;venor was ca&s;t away, will of cour&s;e be found of that extraordinary kind, which ex|traordinary exigencies &s;eem to ju&s;tify. Hannah's hard|&s;hips, which like Camomile, or Anteus, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted in proportion as &s;he was oppre&s;&s;ed, will ea&s;ily be admitted. Even the &s;hark, though I treated it with plea&s;antry, by no means outrages probability; and as to the lion, to tho&s;e, who&s;e convictions have not yielded to the many in|&s;tances Hannah her&s;elf has adduced, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that there is at this moment in the Tower, a tyger, a
<PB N="xvi" REF="19">
creature of a much more ferocious nature than the lion, that was the playfellow of a mid&s;hipman all the way from India.</P>
<P>Hannah's e&s;cape from the lione&s;s is al&s;o reconcileable enough; and, though many &s;imilar in&s;tances may not have occured, there are not wanting &s;ome to bear us out. Father Philip Dechau&s;&s;e, a carmelite, relates a cir|cum&s;tance &s;till more extraordinary: A Portuge&s;e &s;ailing in the Bauge, an Oriental-river, went a&s;hore to enjoy the beauty of the place. He had &s;carcely walked many paces when a frightful crocodile appeared ready to de|vour him. He in&s;tantly recoiled and mea&s;ured his way back again as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and, ju&s;t as he &s;eemed in &s;afety from the jaws of the crocodile, a fami&s;hed tyger made a &s;pring at him, when avoiding him by a providen|tial inclination of his body, the tyger pa&s;&s;ed over the traveller with &s;uch force that he fell into the jaws of the crocodile, and became its prey.</P>
<P>But I am got into &s;uch length that I cannot now &s;top at trifles. I &s;hall, therefore, leaving every thing el&s;e to the candour of the reader, go to Hannah's wind|ing up the whole, which I beg once more to be pardoned for calling her living apotheo&s;is, and yet I cannot &s;ee how I could have u&s;ed a weaker term. I dare &s;ay every one of her hearers, felt her words like the in&s;piration

<P>Thus I have troubled the reader with &s;uch a clue as I flatter my&s;elf will &s;erve to &s;hew how this book was found, by whom it was written, and that the circum|&s;tances it contains are within the &s;cope of probability; and I would not have any one fancy, upon the faith of my having omitted any thing, that I have not enough to &s;ay, if ever the probability of the circum&s;tance &s;hould be attacked. Mo&s;t of the difficult things I know to be prac|ticable, and have no doubt but I can prove it by time, place, and per&s;on; therefore, before any caviler thinks proper to indulge a different opinion, I would have him look to the validity of his own experience, and not pro|nounce a thing impo&s;&s;ible, merely becau&s;e his ability is not equal to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>And now, if this work &s;hould become popular, and the per&s;ons concerned in it attract public curio&s;ity; as it is ten years &s;ince Captain Higgins left the i&s;land, and, therefore, the probability, I like the word, is that there are, by this time, plenty of young Hewits, Hig|ginses, and Walme&s;leys.

<P>All this, however, I leave to the public, a&s;&s;uring them, that if any more of Hannah's writings &s;hould be di&s;covered, and depo&s;ited with me, I &s;hall lend my helping hand to u&s;her them into the world, with the &s;ame fidelity which I have made my ground of conduct in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. IN WHICH, AFTER A MODEST APOLOGY, THE SUB|JECT OF THESE ADVENTURES RELATES A TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THREW HER EARLY UPON THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>HEAVEN only knows whether the&s;e par|ticulars will ever be made public; but, as they contain the hi&s;tory of a harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive individual, who&s;e life has been chequered by a train of extraordinary events; as they &s;hew the firmne&s;s, and vi|gour,

with which providence vouch&s;afes to endow the human mind in proportion to its various trials; and, above all, as it proves in every line the indulgent, and be|nevolent care with which our all merciful Creator is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to watch and protect the meane&s;t of his creatures; &s;o I think it my duty to tru&s;t the&s;e &s;heets to chance, in hopes, through one of tho&s;e un|fore&s;een accidents, by which men are per|mitted to wonder and admire, many a fair eye, and many a manly heart, may pay a tribute of &s;ympathy to the memory of Hannah Hewit.</P>
<P>I was born May 10, 1744, in one of tho&s;e cottages, which are &s;cattered through that well known &s;pot called Coalbrook Dale. My father, who&s;e name was Hig|gins, worked occa&s;ionally in the coal|mines, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in burning coke, extracting iron from ore, and poli&s;hing cylinders; he was an hone&s;t man, and contrived, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my mother, who &s;pun
<PB N="3" REF="24">
wor&s;ted, and knit &s;tockings, to keep &s;ix children, a bed-rid aunt, and my mother's brother, who had been three years deaf and blind in con&s;equence of an explo&s;ion in a coal-mine: at which time &s;everal per&s;ons were cru&s;hed to death; and, among the re&s;t, my brother Peter, who was three years older than I.</P>
<P>Never was a family &s;o marked by mi&s;|fortune as mine. When I was only five years old I lo&s;t my father, my mother, and brother, and &s;i&s;ter, in the following extra|ordinary manner. My father had killed a a large bacon hog, and was preparing to &s;inge it, at which ceremony my mother, and &s;uch of the children as were able, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted. Indeed it was a fea&s;t to us, hogs puddings, and chitterlings, being danties we could not get every day. While we were thus bu&s;ily employed, we ob&s;erved an uncommon light in the little hovel that &s;erved us for a habitation. It was occa|&s;ioned by my little brother, who had put
<PB N="4" REF="25">
&s;traw under his &s;i&s;ter's cradle, a child of &s;ix months old, and &s;et it on fire to &s;inge her in imitation of my father, who was &s;inging the hog. My father, who divined the cau&s;e, flew like lightning into the hou&s;e, and being exa&s;perated at my brother, who was dancing round the cradle all in flames, &s;truck at him, as he thought, with his hand, but it unfortunately contained the fatal knife with which he had killed the hog. The moment he di&s;covered what he had done, he raved and &s;creamed out&mdash;'That he had killed his child!' Then, full of de&s;traction, ran to throw him&s;elf into the Severn. My mother, now rou&s;ed from that &s;tupefaction into which &s;he had been thrown, followed him with &s;uch ex|pedition, that &s;he caught hold of him as he reached the margin of the river. Nei|ther force, nor entreaty could prevail on him to abandon his de&s;perate re&s;olution. She &s;truggled with him, but in vain; 'till, at length, his &s;trength being &s;uperior to her's, as &s;he would not let go her hold, they both fell in and were drowned.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="26">
Young as I was, I &s;hall never forget the impre&s;&s;ion this awful &s;cene made on my tender mind; and, as if providence, who&s;e daughter I am, and who&s;e care I have always been, had determined to arm me with proper fortitude for my alarm|ing &s;ituation, and vigour to &s;upport through life the various misfortunes I was born to encounter, my reflections became firm, and deci&s;ive, and I was no longer a child from that moment.</P>
<P>The unhappy condition of tho&s;e of my family that remained, excited the pity of my father's employer, and we were, by his intere&s;t, admitted into the workhou&s;e. I had learnt to &s;pin long before this; but, here, I learnt to read, and write; which &s;o employed my mind, that I was never &s;o happy as when I was improving my&s;elf. This extraordinary indu&s;try and applica|tion attracted the notice of the vicar, a venerable and mo&s;t amiable man, of whom I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to &s;peak.
<PB N="6" REF="27">
I owe to him tho&s;e &s;entiments that have been the comfort, and con&s;olation of my life. His name was Williams; and, if he be alive, and &s;hould read this, he will have fre&s;h occa&s;ion to commend me for ob&s;erv|ing his le&s;&s;ons which, though my life has been unfortunate, has kept it irreproach|able.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had perfected my&s;elf in one thing, I learnt another, and there was no trade practi&s;ed in the workhou&s;e that I had not &s;ome notion of. Reading and writing, however, were, at that time, the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of my life; and to tho&s;e employments I devoted all my lei&s;ure hours; but what begat in me the greate&s;t emulation was reading tho&s;e works written by my own &s;ex; who, I confe&s;s, I &s;ecretly envied, and devoutly wi&s;hed that, in time, I might a&s;pire to the enviable di&s;tinction of being con&s;idered as a female writer, little divining &s;o fatal a propen&s;ity would only be gratified by recording, upon the
<PB N="7" REF="28">
leaves of a tree, in an uninhabited i&s;land, the &s;ad vici&s;&s;itudes of my unfortunate life.</P>
<P>This de&s;ire was con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed by the &s;ucce&s;s that attended Mr. Williams's daughter, a young lady of uncommon ta|lents, and a prodigy of learning. Her poems were read with admiration, and &s;he was con&s;idered as the be&s;t lady writer &s;ince Sapho. To be &s;ure &s;he wrote a play, which did not &s;ucceed, but this was attributed to its having been written with &s;trict decency, a circum&s;tance often neglected I mu&s;t confe&s;s; but, I hope, for the honour of my &s;ex, that when their writings verge towards ob&s;cenity, 'tis not becau&s;e that &s;tyle is natural, or habitual to them, but becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to write indelicately to plea&s;e an indelicate age.</P>
<P>In this, however, Mi&s;s Williams, who&s;e chri&s;tian name was Margery, con&s;idered le&s;s her fame, than her honour; and, I flatter my&s;elf, I have &s;o well profitted by
<PB N="8" REF="29">
her example, that though I may have, in the cour&s;e of this work, many &s;trong cir|cum&s;tances to relate, no one will be able to accu&s;e me of &s;uffu&s;ing the check of mo|de&s;ty with a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>In addition to the &s;mattering of litera|ture I picked up at over hours, which I employed in whatever indu&s;try I was &s;et about at the Vicar's, I &s;tudied, &s;uperfici|ally, all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which Mi&s;s Williams po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o perfect a degree; &s;o that, what between the workhou&s;e and the Vicar's, before I was ten years old, I could &s;pin, knit, knot, &s;ew, &s;titch, darn, make gloves, mend &s;hoes, do ru&s;h, &s;traw, and cane work; write, draw, point a hob|nail, and play upon the guitar.</P>
<P>But now a much larger field for the exerci&s;e of my talents was opened to me. A con&s;iderable manufacturer, at Wolver|hampton, having dined at the Vicar's, and taken notice not only of the adroitne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="30">
with which I had, under the tuition of Mi&s;s Margery Williams, &s;et about painting a fire&s;kreen, but the improvements I had &s;ugge&s;ted to the carpenter, as to the prin|ciple on which he had mounted it, de|clared, from what he &s;aw, I &s;hould be of infinite &s;ervice in the japanning line, into which employ it is very common to take girls from the workhou&s;e.</P>
<P>My benefactor caught at this &s;ug|ge&s;tion, and to be brief, for this is a part of my hi&s;tory that I ought to compre&s;s into as narrow a compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks I was bound apprentice to Mr. Smallbrook, who every body mu&s;t remember as an eminent manufacturer in the japan line at Wolverhampton.</P>
<P>My employ was to paint birds, bea&s;ts, butterflies, fruit, and land&s;capes, upon urns, tea boards, bread ba&s;kets, and toilette boxes; and I have no doubt but many of my fair readers may be induced, from this
<PB N="10" REF="31">
pa&s;&s;age, to wi&s;h that &s;ome commode, pin|ca&s;e, or patch-box, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, may be of my painting. Certainly, if &s;uch a fact could be a&s;certained, many a trifle that has pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e hands might, from the &s;ingular circum&s;tances of my &s;trange for|tune, be con&s;idered in as curious and va|luable a light as the mould of a queen Elizabeth's farthing, or the feathers upon the wing of the hunch-back beetle.</P>
<P>To &s;uch as are de&s;irous of knowing whether they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any ve&s;t|ige of tho&s;e toys, and uten&s;ils, which, from 1757, to 1764, were principally &s;ugge&s;ted by me, and which have rendered &s;o cele|brated the manufactory of Pontipool; I &s;hall hold out a clue to di&s;cover the truth. If the &s;ubject be a &s;hepherde&s;s getting over a &s;tyle, and uncon&s;ciou&s;ly betraying the &s;ymetry of a well turned leg to a con|cealed &s;hepherd, or, as its companion, a Strephon plunging into a tran&s;parent brook, and buffetting a&s;ide the yielding
<PB N="11" REF="32">
waves with his &s;inewy limbs, while his en|amoured Daphne, her lamb by her &s;ide, &s;tands facinated as &s;he peeps through the umbrage of a clo&s;e enwovened wood, the de&s;ign is &s;ure to be mine, and, perhaps, the execution.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;ubject, even at this di&s;tance of time, forces tears into my eyes, for it brings to my recollection that fatal day I fell in love with John Hewit, the author of all my pains and plea&s;ures; the only difference in the &s;ituation of the picture is, that I was varni&s;hing a plate warmer in the garret, with a cat upon my &s;houlder, and he was tinning a &s;aucepan in the &s;mithy.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance of the cat is ex|tremely well worth attending to, and I am particularly plea&s;ed, that my noticing it here gives me an opportunity of recol|lecting that I mu&s;t have had an extraordi|nary con&s;ideration and re&s;pect for the un|fortunate at my time of life; for I per|fectly
<PB N="12" REF="33">
well remember, that my partiality to cats aro&s;e from their being an animal that all the world per&s;ecuted: I will con|fe&s;s that, being a female, and fond of eru|dition, I had &s;ome unea&s;y moments le&s;t my predelection for tabbies might be the means of my becoming an old maid; but, having &s;een John Hewit, I grew perfectly ea&s;y on that head.</P>
<P>I need not apologize, in this place, to the intelligent reader, who knows that the minute&s;t circum&s;tances are of con&s;equence in an extraordinary and complicate hi&s;tory like mine; and I may, perhaps, have, hereafter, rea&s;on to remark that providence permitted this very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ingular and almo&s;t ludicrous as it was, to in&s;pire me with a de&s;ire of &s;oliciting a protection to which I at this moment owe the pre&s;er|vation of my life and my honour&mdash;but of that in its place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. SOME REMARKS ON THE FORCE OF DESTINY, AND AN ACCOUNT OF JOHN HEWIT, AND HIS TWO MALE FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE variety of occupations followed at Wolverhampton, coming in contact with a mind thir&s;ting after improvement, and fertile in invention, like mine, no wonder if my progre&s;s, as an arti&s;t and a mechanic, was remarkable. No ingenious device, elegant form, or ta&s;ty invention, was put into hand 'till I was con&s;ulted. At length my judgment and opinion became &s;o ce|lebrated, that, before I was fifteen, my abilities were con&s;idered as equal to a fortune, and I might have made my choice among the mo&s;t opulent at Wol|verhampton.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="35">
De&s;tiny, however, which all mu&s;t obey, an ob&s;ervation that never was more truly verified than in my wayward fortune, or|dained otherwi&s;e. John Hewit, though a man of indifferent character, bad connec|tions, low conver&s;ation, and only an ap|pretice to a tinman; why, or wherefore, I did not know, won my heart in &s;pight of me; and, for him, I rejected with di&s;dain the mo&s;t eligible offers.</P>
<P>Were I to avail my&s;elf of my privi|lege as a writer, I might defend my con|duct upon various principles; but, as I am writing a life, and not a controver&s;y, I &s;hall only &s;peak of my&s;elf as a woman, and &s;ay that, though my conduct was mad|ne&s;s, I could not have courage to argue with the impul&s;e I felt; and, therefore, yielded to what I knew would make me mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>To account for my partiality to the ob|ject of my affections, his exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="15" REF="36">
of my heart, to the di&s;comfiture of &s;o many plate-harne&s;s, button, buckle, and thimble-makers, for the rancour, &s;candal, and &s;lander of all the Wolverhampton fe|males; and, in &s;hort, for that di&s;content to others, and mi&s;ery to my&s;elf, which I cau&s;ed in my implicit obedience to my de&s;tiny; I &s;hall only &s;ay, that whatever he might be in other re&s;pects, John Hewit was the hand&s;ome&s;t man eyes ever be|held.</P>
<P>That I may not, however, lay under the imputation of &s;en&s;uality, I had many other motives for this conduct. In the fir&s;t place, he had a vile character; and with what plea&s;ure did I contemplate the glory I &s;hould reap in reclaiming him.&mdash;Then he was illiterate, uninformed, and brutal; and how could I employ the in|formation I had picked up better than in in&s;tructing, poli&s;hing, and civilizing him? Could I have a properer opportunity to put into active practice that beneficence and
<PB N="16" REF="37">
philanthropy I had learnt from the Vicar and his daughter? To oblige any fellow-creature, is a &s;atisfaction to a heart like mine, but to oblige a hand&s;ome man, and one whom fate de&s;tined for her hu&s;band, is &s;urely the mo&s;t brilliant trait that ever complimented the di&s;ernment and mind of a female.</P>
<P>John Hewit was the &s;on of a cow-driver, near Shefnal. His father had the misfortune to be tried and convicted of a highway robbery; but as every body knew he was not guilty of the theft, which, be|yond a doubt, was committed by the &s;on of a rich grazier in the neighbourhood, the jury, and, in particular, the father of the thief, who was one of them, recom|mended him to mercy, in con&s;equence of which he was only tran&s;ported for life.</P>
<P>The family of old Hewit, con&s;i&s;ting of a wife and three children, of whom John was the elde&s;t, were now obliged to &s;hift
<PB N="17" REF="38">
for them&s;elves; and John, being admired for his beauty by the wife of a farrier, who, be&s;ides, had a regard for his mother; he was employed, being thirteen years old, to hold the hor&s;es, and to do whatever el&s;e he could to render him&s;elf u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Though this farrier was very like Vul|can, being lame, brutal, and a black&s;mith; I cannot &s;ay his good dame, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, bore a re&s;emblance to Venus, ex|cept in her pa&s;&s;ion for Adonis, who&s;e per|fect re&s;emblance, as far as de&s;cription goes, &s;he certainly had in her hou&s;e, and Fame does them both inju&s;tice, or the re|&s;emblance of their amour was al&s;o realized, for the farrier, before John was fifteen, be|came &s;uch a nay-word that he turned him away, but not 'till he had purloined a ring and a watch, which circum&s;tance the good lady did not think proper to impart to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>After this he rambled about with &s;ome
<PB N="18" REF="39">
gip&s;ies, and took one &s;hort trip to &s;ea. At la&s;t good Par&s;on Williams, who was the con&s;tant friend of di&s;tre&s;s, and who, indeed, had been in&s;trumental in &s;aving the life of John's father, undertook, out of pity to his mother, to put him out ap|prentice.</P>
<P>Being heartily tired of his rambles, he took to his bu&s;ine&s;s pretty well; and for two years his ma&s;ter was perfectly &s;atisfied with him; but, as folly is a combu&s;tible in which the &s;malle&s;t &s;park will ea&s;ily cau&s;e an explo&s;ion, &s;o the notice that was taken of him, for being now upwards of &s;eventeen, he went by the name of the hand&s;ome Tinman, puffed up his vanity to &s;uch a degree, that he began to be fully convinced he &s;hould make his for|tune by means of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>In this prepo&s;terous idea he was en|couraged by his companions, with whom he was perpetually in the company of
<PB N="19" REF="40">
loo&s;e women. Among the&s;e companions was one called Thomas Sourby, a name I have rea&s;on enough to cur&s;e. This man had ruined the principles of many young men, and young women too, in the neigh|bourhood, a matter of no great difficulty in a manufacturing place, where &s;o many males and females of all ages and com|plexions promi&s;cuou&s;ly work together.</P>
<P>He had &s;uch con&s;ummate art, and &s;uch a perfect knowledge of mankind, that he made them &s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ures and convenience, under an idea of teach|ing them how to go through the world: and was &s;o adroit in his bu&s;ine&s;s, that whenever he did ami&s;s, &s;omebody el&s;e was &s;u&s;pected; and whenever others did what was prai&s;e worthy, he was &s;ure to arrogate all the credit. If any one was protected from a thief, or their goods &s;aved out of a fire, though he came, perhaps, after the danger was over, he &s;o managed it that he was con&s;idered as the &s;ole in&s;trument
<PB N="20" REF="41">
of their pre&s;ervation; and, on the con|trary, if he wired twenty hares, the &s;u&s;pi|cion lay upon &s;omebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, however, that nothing could be &s;o obvious as his real character, and yet nobody &s;aw it. He had no em|ploy, no fortune, no means, yet he was al|ways flu&s;h of money. He was arrogant, ignorant, and pre&s;uming, yet every body li&s;tened to his advice. Every body di&s;|pi&s;ed him, every body feared him, and every body courted him.</P>
<P>I divined him, to my misforrune, in a moment. His whole conduct con&s;i&s;ted but of three qualities, which qualities, whoever, has the unmerciful courage to practi&s;e, however de&s;picable they may ap|pear in the eyes of men of intrin&s;ic merit, will, with the generalty of the world, be loaded with care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e qualities were, penetration to
<PB N="21" REF="42">
di&s;cover the follies of others, impudence to defend your own, and want of feeling to take advantage of both. No man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e diabolical qualities in a &s;tronger degree than Thomas Sourby; and, of cour&s;e, no man could be more cal|culated to wind round his finger &s;uch an ea&s;y, vain, credulous creature as John Hewit.</P>
<P>There was another young man at Wolverhampton, who&s;e name was Wil|liam Binns. He was exactly the rever&s;e of Sourby, his heart being as good as the other's was wicked; and, indeed, they were not only marked by contrary &s;enti|ments, but contrary fortunes: Sourby liv|ing at random, nobody knew how, and Binns being e&s;tabli&s;hed as an active part|ner with Mr. Gregory, his half uncle, a re&s;pectable and flouri&s;hing manufacturer.</P>
<P>This partner&s;hip aro&s;e from the follow|ing circum&s;tance:</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="43">
Mr. Gregory had a brother, who was many years his partner upon mutual &s;hares; this brother died, and left his pro|portion of the concern to his widow, who&s;e maiden name was Binns. She had an idle brother, who, after lavi&s;hing away what his parents could afford him, and lo&s;ing many good opportunities of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing him&s;elf, at la&s;t forfeited the good opinion of his relations, was di&s;|carded, and, rather than &s;tarve, got an employment, &s;omething &s;imilar to that of my father, in Coalbrook Dale.</P>
<P>There he married a poor but indu&s;|trious woman, who brought him &s;everal children, and behaved &s;o well to him, that he grew more &s;ober, and di&s;creet. This in|duced his &s;i&s;ter, the widow, to con&s;ider him again as her brother; but as low com|pany was his delight, and, indeed, he was not by nature calculated for any liberal, or ingenious pur&s;uit, &s;he contented her&s;elf with eking out his pittance with a &s;mall
<PB N="23" REF="44">
annuity; and, in other re&s;pects, contri|buting at times to his comfort and conve|nience. She was, al&s;o, often heard to de|clare, &s;he &s;hould remember his children in her will, and when he &s;hould have a boy grown to a proper age, &s;he would take care of his education, and bring him up in the bu&s;ine&s;s in which &s;he yet retained her &s;hare, as &s;he was very anxious to keep up the name of Binns.</P>
<P>The unhappy wife of this man fell a victim among others, to that explo&s;ion of a coal-mine, in which, as I have already mentioned, my uncle was &s;o materially hurt, and my poor little brother killed. After her lo&s;s the hu&s;band relap&s;ed into his former irregularities.

<P>Binns, who was acquainted with Hewit, took a great deal of trouble to &s;hew him the ab&s;urdity of his conduct, and, of cour&s;e, got affronted for his pains. This, however, did not check him.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. AN ACCOUNT OF JOHN HEWIT'S TWO FEMALE FRIENDS, AND A MOST POWERFUL INSTANCE OF THE DREADFUL EFFECTS OF INDISCRETION.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time an affair happened that became a town talk. One Jenny Rhodes, a &s;orry hu&s;&s;ey who worked in a large but|ton manufactory, proved with child; and though her connections with the young men in the place were certainly very pro|mi&s;cuous, &s;he determined to &s;wear the child to John Hewit, not becau&s;e there was a greater probability of his being the father than &s;everal others, but becau&s;e he had &s;lighted her for one Su&s;an Win|grove, another Wolverhampton girl, who al&s;o bore a bad character.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="47">
This la&s;t mentioned girl convinced that, if the other had not taken a fal&s;e oath, &s;he had at lea&s;t &s;worn very hard, le|velled a whole volley of abu&s;e at her as &s;he came from her examination before the ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>She reiterated the names of all tho&s;e to whom Jenny Rhodes had &s;hewn her fa|vours, and pointed out plainly, by cir|cum&s;tances, to the &s;atisfaction of a &s;ur|rounding mob, who were wonderfully en|tertained at this curious &s;cene, the great improbability of John's being the father of the child.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that there is nothing which a di&s;appointed woman will not meditate, and &s;o it happened in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; for being thus expo&s;ed and laughed at, this wretch conceived the mo&s;t horrid de&s;ign that ever entered a &s;ub|tle head, or was conceived by a vile heart. She knew that John Hewit was to meet
<PB N="27" REF="48">
this Su&s;an Wingrove that evening, in a walk, about a mile from the town, called Love-lane. There &s;he concealed her&s;elf; and watching an opportunity, favourable for her purpo&s;e, that is to &s;ay, at the very moment John was cro&s;&s;ing over a &s;tyle, and could not &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed in the lane, &s;he ru&s;hed upon this poor wretch, plunged a knife into her bo&s;om, and in&s;tantly e&s;|caped.</P>
<P>When Hewit came to the &s;pot where he was to meet this girl, he found her weltering in her blood. She &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;igns of life, but could not &s;peak. While he &s;tood in a &s;tate of di&s;|traction, wi&s;hing to admin&s;ter relief to her, and not knowing in what manner, he &s;aw Sourby at a di&s;tance, who, &s;ummoned by a loud hollow, came up and &s;eemed ex|tremely &s;hocked at the dreadful &s;pectacle before him. He &s;hrugged, and called it a &s;trange bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;aid, that it was proper, neverthele&s;s, out of charity, to
<PB N="28" REF="49">
convey the poor creature to &s;ome place where &s;he might be taken care of.</P>
<P>She was received into a neighbouring cottage, and a &s;urgeon &s;ent for. In the mean time a thou&s;and enquiries went for|ward, as to how this murder came about. John told very artle&s;sly, but with great contradiction and embarra&s;&s;ment, all he knew; and, upon the whole, &s;o &s;atisfied his hearers, that, except a few doubts, which took their birth from his perplexity, it was univer&s;ally believed to be &s;elf-mur|der, which, Sourby, taking Hewit by the hand, &s;aid, 'he &s;incerely believed, for he had &s;o good an opinion of his friend, that he was &s;ure he was incapable of perpetrat|ing &s;o attrocious an act.'</P>
<P>In the mean time, by &s;ome means or other, &s;he whole town had rung with the news, that John Hewit had killed Su&s;an Wingrove; and the &s;urgeon had &s;carcely &s;earched her wound, and pronounced that it was mortal, and &s;he mu&s;t infallibly die,
<PB N="29" REF="50">
when Binns, who from circum&s;tances, per|haps, had &s;een more of the real truth than any other did, or cho&s;e to &s;ee, pulled him a&s;ide, and told him to lo&s;e no time in mak|ing his e&s;cape, for that there was a warrant again&s;t him for murder.</P>
<P>Hewit ever tainted with that cowardice that attends weak minds, took his friends advice and &s;lipt away; and now, fir&s;t ar|rived the mi&s;tre&s;s of the cottage, who &s;aid the poor creature could &s;peak, and the only word &s;he had uttered was 'Hewit.' Next it was di&s;covered, that Hewit had run away, for which they blamed one an|other all round, and la&s;t, arrived the con|&s;tables to take him up.</P>
<P>Let every young man, who reads this pa&s;&s;age, take warning by it, and &s;hun bad women as he would &s;hun inevitable de&s;|truction, for it is a road to perdition, in which, tread as cautiou&s;ly as he will, he is in danger of peri&s;hing at every &s;tep. As
<PB N="30" REF="51">
&s;oon as the poor wretch could &s;peak, &s;he did, indeed, pronounce the name of Hewit, as the good woman of the cottage had informed her neighbours; but had &s;he &s;taid five minutes longer in the room, &s;he would have heard her acquit him of the crime, and accu&s;e Jenny Rhodes.</P>
<P>A hue and cry was now made after Jenny Rhodes, but the con&s;tables, who are not remarkable for vigilance either at Wolverhamton, or el&s;ewhere, were again at fault; for when they arrived at her ha|bitation, &s;he had al&s;o made her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The public conver&s;ation turned va|riou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject. Some would have it that Hewit was the murderer, and that the girl, out of affection to her lover, and hatred to her rival, had accu&s;ed her, and acquitted him. Others in&s;i&s;ted that it mu&s;t have been Jenny Rhodes, who was known to be a wicked hu&s;&s;ey, adding, that it was very unlikely the poor dying young
<PB N="31" REF="52">
creature would tell a lie with her la&s;t breath; and others, again, very &s;agaciou&s;ly remarked, that they mu&s;t both have had a hand in it, for that both had ran away. Tho&s;e words, however, were not her la&s;t, nor was the &s;urgeon's judgment &s;o infalli|ble as he had pronounced it, for &s;he &s;oon grew better, and in &s;ix weeks got perfectly well.</P>
<P>Jenny Rhodes, as &s;oon as &s;he heard that Su&s;an Wingrove was out of danger, returned; and as &s;he could not be tried for murder, made no &s;cruple to declare that &s;he had given the wound to get rid of them both, for that Hewit was the only man &s;he ever loved, and finding her&s;elf &s;lighted, &s;he re&s;olved to do one or other, or both, a mi&s;chief the fir&s;t opportunity. In the bu&s;ine&s;s of the child, &s;he al&s;o acknow|ledged, &s;he was actuated by revenge, for that Hewit could not po&s;&s;ibly be the father.</P>
<P>As John was, in every re&s;pect, inno|cent,
<PB N="32" REF="53">
he now became an object of univer|&s;al compa&s;&s;ion, and every po&s;&s;ible &s;tep was taken to induce him to return, but in vain. His ma&s;ter adverti&s;ed him as a runaway apprentice, which adverti&s;ement appeared in the Daily Adverti&s;er of the 18th of September, 1760, hand bills were di&s;tri|buted; no John returned. At la&s;t at Chri&s;tmas time, in the year 1763, I am &s;ure I have rea&s;on enough to remember the circum&s;tance, he was pa&s;&s;ed to his pari&s;h from the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable and emaciated &s;tate as a va|grant.</P>
<P>Thus the wicked wretch, who had been the cau&s;e of all this mi&s;chief, &s;tayed upon the &s;pot, brazening out every thing, and glorying in her infamy; while he, who&s;e crime amounted, at mo&s;t, to im|prudence, bore all the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But the decree was ju&s;t. Bold guilt will ever, in the end, find its reward. The
<PB N="33" REF="54">
law will overtake it, and &s;o it did here, for Jenny Rhodes was hanged at Warwick two years afterwards, &s;or the murder of this very child &s;he fal&s;ely &s;wore to Hewit; but imprudence carries with it its own puni&s;hment: It is a coward in vice, and trembles at &s;care-crow con&s;equences, in|vented by fear. Had John Hewit felt him&s;elf fully con&s;cious that his conduct had been completely irreproachable, he would have braved an inve&s;tigation; but as he knew he had a&s;&s;ociated with wretches who were capable of &s;wearing his life away, innocence it&s;elf was no &s;hield for him; and, out of de&s;pair, he left his home to become a wanderer and to &s;uffer, as the reader &s;hall &s;ee, puni&s;hment enough. Let not young men, therefore, be imprudent. The torture cannot puni&s;h innocence; the mind can &s;mile at it: Whereas &s;elf re|proaching imprudence will goad the mind until it find a torture for it&s;elf; which, in|deed, is its only e&s;cape from infamy, for
<PB N="34" REF="55">
I'll venture to &s;ay, that any young man, who has been repeatedly imprudent, and has not reproached him&s;elf, has gone a great way, indeed, towards villany.</P>
<P>But if it be difficult for a young man to retreat from imprudence&mdash;what mu&s;t it be for a young woman? The world are very little inclined to &s;often imprudence with the mild name of misfortune; and it is generally impo&s;&s;ible, and always very difficult for the poor wretch hert&s;elf, how|&s;oever well &s;he may be inclined, to over|come the contumely and &s;corn that is con&s;tantly thrown upon her. Thus one crime follows another, and unhappy wretches of this de&s;cription, are lo&s;t, fir&s;t to them&s;elves, and afterwards to &s;ociety, except when &s;ome extraordinary circum|&s;tance points out to the world a mode of reconciliation, they, them&s;elves, have not the courage to adopt. Both the&s;e con|&s;equences happened in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.
<PB N="35" REF="56">
Jenny Rhodes was hanged, and Su&s;an Wingrove, having lei&s;ure to repent of her pa&s;t life upon a &s;ick bed, became, af|terwards, by the good offices of Par&s;on Williams, a &s;incere penitent, and was treated as an unfortunate woman, en|titled to the countenance of her &s;ex, and the con&s;ideration of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. TOUCHES UPON SAGACITY AND PRUDENCE, AND INFORMS THE READER OF SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO HANNAH'S ELDEST BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN HEWIT had &s;carcely left the coun|try when I got a complete in&s;ight into the bu&s;ine&s;s that had terminated &s;o unfor|tunately for him. I found that he and the two women had been dupes to Sourby, who contrived the whole with the diabolical in|tention of getting rid of them all; and the&s;e were his rea&s;ons: He was tired of a connec|tion with Jenny Rhodes, by whom he had that child, which &s;he fal&s;ely &s;wore to Hewit; he loved Su&s;an Wingrove, of whom he was determined to be revenged, becau&s;e &s;he preferred Hewit to him; and he de|te&s;ted
<PB N="37" REF="58">
Hewit for perpetually &s;tepping be|fore him in the favour of women, notwith|&s;tanding all his own arts; and, be&s;ides all this, he had a more powerful motive: a &s;ecret de&s;ign again&s;t me: in which, he thought, he &s;tood no chance of &s;ucce&s;s unle&s;s he could put Hewit out of the way.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that I thoroughly knew the heart and principles of this man; this knowledge with which one would think I was in&s;pired, &s;eemed to guard me again&s;t all his practices, and it was re|tentively keeping to my&s;elf how com|pletely I had in my mind developed his character, that gave me opportunity, not only of fru&s;trating all his de&s;igns, but of coming at their motives.</P>
<P>Hewit had hardly turned his back when Sourby unma&s;ked, and gave me clearly to under&s;tand that he wi&s;hed me to con&s;ider him as a lover. Timed as this declaration
<PB N="38" REF="59">
was, I could not but &s;ee, in a moment, into the whole my&s;tery. I concealed, however, my &s;u&s;picions; and turning his own arts again&s;t him&s;elf, I contrived, by leading que&s;tions, in different conver&s;a|tions, to come, in parcels, at the whole of what I have ju&s;t related; nor even young and inexperienced as I was, is there any thing extraordinary in this? He was too vain of his influence over others to believe he could po&s;&s;ibly be vulnerable him&s;elf; be&s;ides he had conquered and deceived experienced and artful women; what need then of much caution with one &s;o artle&s;s as I was? This foible I played upon. I pretended to li&s;ten to him with plea&s;ure, till I had wormed out of him enough for my purpo&s;e; I then unma&s;ked in my turn, and &s;hewed him he was in my power; but, like Tamerline, bid him keep his own wicked &s;ecret and be &s;afe, upon con|dition, he never troubled me again with his nau&s;eous love.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="60">
It is &s;o eafy for women, completely virtuous, to penetrate the arts of de&s;ign|ing lovers, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed they ever fall into a &s;nare. The confident and bru|tal manner in which Clari&s;&s;a confe&s;&s;es Lovelace eyed her in the coach from Hamp&s;tead, would have been enough for me; and, however, through the medium of exaggeration, &s;uch circum&s;tances upon paper, may &s;erve as a warning, I'll ven|ture to &s;ay, the woman, in real life, who notices and feels the force of &s;uch a look from a profligate lover, and is afterwards betrayed, lends a helping hand to her own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf I had long made my de|termination to have John Hewit, or re|main &s;ingle; otherwi&s;e, as I have before noticed, I could have had my choice of hu&s;bands; and among the re&s;t, who, like Edwin, &s;ighed, but never &s;poke of love, was that hone&s;t creature Binns.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="61">
That part of my life which pa&s;t during the ab&s;ence of Hewit, was certainly little more than a cha&s;m in an active hi&s;tory like mine; I, therfore, as if I felt a pre|&s;entiment of all that was to befal me, was con&s;tantly employed in qualifying my&s;elf in every thing that could counteract the evils of life, and, above all, in &s;toring my mind with every gift and ingredient ne|ce&s;&s;ary to become the be&s;t wife in the world.</P>
<P>So much was my mind occupied in this manner, that nothing was more common than to hear people &s;ay, that if Hannah Hewit were to be thrown de&s;titute upon an uninhabited i&s;land, &s;he would find &s;o many re&s;ources in her own ingenuity as to give her little rea&s;on to regret her &s;epera|tion from &s;ociety, which remarks I never heard but I &s;huddered; though at that time, nothing could be farther from my thoughts, than that I &s;hould have &s;uch
<PB N="41" REF="62">
deplorable cau&s;e to call that ingenuity into action.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s, in the interval, before Hewit's return, at which time this hi&s;tory will become more active, to give &s;ome account of what became of my own family. The reader will remember the untimely fate of my father and mother, and my little brother and &s;i&s;ter; and that after that unfortunate circum&s;tance, there remained only my uncle and aunt, and my two brothers. My uncle and aunt died in the workhou&s;e. My elde&s;t bro|brother, who was nine years older than I, and of a wild di&s;po&s;ition, ran away and entered on board of &s;hip; and my other brother, who was not &s;o old by four years, having learnt to write a fine hand, was taken into the hou&s;e of an attorney; and, at la&s;t, became &s;o u&s;eful to him, that he articled him as a clerk.</P>
<P>Wild as my elde&s;t brother was, his
<PB N="42" REF="63">
mind was noble, and he had an enterpri|&s;ing &s;pirit. I knew him to be incapable of any thing vile, or unworthy; and, therefore, had not the lea&s;t doubt but that he would honourably make his way through the world. It was not long be|fore I was convinced of this, for as he had a great affection for me, and had faith|fully kept up a corre&s;pondence with me, as often as his precarious way of life gave him opportunity, I not only became acquainted with all that he did, but had it in my power, by means of an&s;wers to his letters, to give him a little &s;i&s;terly advice; which, though in his light way, he com|mented on with great humour, he certainly took in good part, and never failed kindly to thank me for.</P>
<P>My brother, when a private man, was cho&s;en by the admiral as his cock&s;wain. He was afterwards placed upon the quar|ter deck; and, in proce&s;s of time, pa&s;&s;ed as a lieutenant; but as promotion in the
<PB N="43" REF="64">
navy was &s;low, and many young men of gallantry had, at that time, a thir&s;t for privateering, though he had not intere&s;t to procure a command for him&s;elf, he got to be fir&s;t lieutenant of a very fine pri|vateer out of Bri&s;tol, of twenty-eight guns, called the Britannia.</P>
<P>This was about &s;ix months after John Hewit left Wolverhampton; and my bro|ther being at that time crui&s;ing in the channel, and, of cour&s;e, frequently in and out of port, I heard from him often; which, indeed, was almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary, for the new&s;papers were perpetually &s;peak|ing of his valour and conduct; and though only &s;econd in command in a privateer, his character, as a naval officer, &s;tood very high.</P>
<P>About this time he was concerned in an adventure that made a great noi&s;e, the particulars of which he imparted to
<PB N="44" REF="65">
me in a letter, and I cannot do better than lay it before my readers. I have certainly no copy of it, but am able to tran&s;cribe it from my memory with great fidelity. It will &s;erve to give an excellent trait of his character.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR HANNAH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;truck a &s;troke that has made my fortune. If I had failed, I &s;hould have been hanged. What I did was mu|tiny; I have &s;ucceeded, and the world, and e&s;pecially the merchants of Bri&s;tol, will call it magnanimity. But this is the nature of mankind.</P>
<P>Not to keep you in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, we fell in, four days ago, with a loggerheaded St. Domingo man, richly laden with cot|ton and indigo, but almo&s;t double our
<PB N="46" REF="67">
force. We called a coun&s;el of the offi|cers, and the captain was again&s;t fighting her, and by all the laws of prudence he was right. Being, however, a kind of now or never bu&s;ine&s;s for me, I took advan|tage of the anxiety of the fine fellows who longed to have a bru&s;h at her, and u&s;ed every argument in my power to ob|tain his con&s;ent, but in vain&mdash;cur&s;edly mortifying! to lo&s;e &s;uch a prize, &s;uch a regale to &s;o many jolly dogs and their fa|milies. I took another touch at per&s;uad|ing him, it would not do, he repre&s;ented the ri&s;k we ran, and the almo&s;t utter im|po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding being taken; he appealed particularly to me, whether I did not know him for a man of courage, and &s;aid this was not courage, it was mad|ne&s;s. Lord I knew every word he uttered to be truth; but what then, had we not a fine &s;tupid looking hull in &s;ight, lined with bales of cotton. Ah Hannah! if you had but &s;een how we were &s;tanding up to her when we received po&s;itive orders to put

about &s;hip and run away, damme you would have done as I did. Come my lads, &s;aid I, we'll fight her. The wicked rogues, what dye think they did? They gave me three cheers. 'Very well,' &s;aid the captain, 're|member I have no hand in this, this is mutiny.' Dye hear that, my boys, &s;aid I, the captain orders all hands to quarters. So on I went, you &s;ee, as my brother the lawyer &s;ays, <HI>&s;ecundem artem;</HI> &s;anctioning all my orders with the captain's name, while he was cur&s;ing away in the cabin, and &s;wearing he would bring me to a court martial. Well, what would you have? We knocked her about gloriou&s;ly! It would have done your heart good to have been with us. At la&s;t, running long &s;ide of her, captain, &s;aid I, I am going by your orders to board the St. Domingo man: No &s;ooner &s;aid than done; whip I was aboard her in the poi&s;ing of a cap&s;tern bar. Struck her colours with my own hand, you jade, got her papers, battened every thing right and tight. Well, what dye ye think
<PB N="48" REF="69">

I don't know how it is, but you never knew a fellow in your life that was in half &s;o good a cue for making love as when he had ju&s;t been a fighting; and then I had been out of &s;ight of &s;hore &s;o long. I bru&s;hed up to them both&mdash;what do you think hap|pened? Turning my eyes towards the &s;tate room, a poor unfortunate woman lay at her length; the poor &s;oul had received her commi&s;&s;ion for the next world; but looking further, a helple&s;s little infant&mdash;The little toad has, at this moment, got hold of my finger, Hannah&mdash;Let me write you little &s;lut do! Well &s;he was to all ap|pearance dead. She had fallen, it &s;eems, with her mother, and lain for more than a quarter of an hour weltering in blood, 'till &s;he had &s;creamed her&s;elf hoar&s;e, and lo&s;t her &s;trength. This, you &s;ee, I learnt from my two enamoratas, who had &s;een all this, and had given the poor little &s;oul no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I was devili&s;hly in love
<PB N="49" REF="70">
with them now to be &s;ure. You never heard &s;uch fine love language in your life. I cur&s;ed them for two infernal hell-cats, and bid them be&s;tir them&s;elves and a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor little creature, or I'd put them in irons. Well, away I went to work, brought her to, got a fire; but the be&s;t of it was, our people not hearing any thing of me, thought I was murdered, &s;o aboard they came in a &s;hoal. What dye think I was about? Making pap for little Britannia. I mean to call her Britannia Hannah. I have taken good care of her ever &s;ince. Whenever I can &s;pare time, &s;he is upon my knee, and then, by way of mortifying the jezabels, who would have let her die without help, I make them turn out watch, and watch to nur&s;e her. But, Hannah, you are to under&s;tand the&s;e are not En|gli&s;h women, they are a &s;ort of Spani&s;h mulattos. No, no, I have &s;een a pretty many countries, but either for beauty, or goodne&s;s, there are no women in the world like the Engli&s;h. The mother of my little

charge was an American. Her features are very beautiful; and &s;o after a bit of a &s;nivel, for you know I am a woman in the&s;e matters, I had her treated with all decency, and then committed her to Davy Jones's locker; and for want of a chap|lain, I &s;aid the burial &s;ervice my&s;elf, and, perhaps, with as much &s;incerity, as his re|verence. And &s;o you &s;ee the love I was in &s;uch a cur&s;ed hurry to entertain for the dingy ladies, I transferred to the mother of my little &s;miling companion.

No, no; that is my pride; a true &s;ailor never thinksof &s;kin deep plea|&s;ures whenever any thing comes acro&s;s him that intere&s;ts the heart.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t be brief, as the Gho&s;t &s;ays in Hamlet, 'The prize is going to leave

I have put on board the &s;econd lieu|tenant, as prize-ma&s;ter, Jack Ringbolt, Dick Daw&s;on, Joe Mu&s;grove, and the clevere&s;t fellow, of an ordinary &s;eaman, I ever met with, one Charles Walm&s;ley, I entered him my&s;elf at Bri&s;tol, he is a de|vili&s;h &s;ightly &s;ellow, and &s;ings a good &s;ong, but what's better, as we boarded the St. Domingo man, he &s;ent a Spani&s;h ra&s;cal to Abraham's bo&s;om ju&s;t as he was aiming a a pole ax at my head.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. THE SEQUEL OF CAPTAIN HIGGINS'S INFORMATION&mdash;A LETTER FROM CHARLES WAMLESLEY&mdash;AND SOME ACCOUNT OF HANNAH'S SECOND BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>THE event turned out as my brother had predicted. He was carried round Bri&s;tol on the &s;ailor's &s;houlders, the owners im|mediately &s;ub&s;cribed to build a privateer of thity-&s;ix guns, the large&s;t that ever &s;ailed out of that port; and the poor cap|tain was advi&s;ed to &s;tay at home with his family, and looked upon as a very peacea|ble, worthy member of &s;ociety, but as one not fit to command a fighting &s;hip; nay, he could never after get an employ in the merchant's &s;ervice; for, of cour&s;e, he
<PB N="54" REF="75">
who would not not attack an enemy, could not defend him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do my brother the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he was indefatigable in defending the reputation of his captain; but all his efforts were con&s;idered as hand&s;ome in|&s;tances of his own forbearance and di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, and only &s;erved, while they the better confirmed him in the good opinion of his employers to load the poor unfor|tunate captain with additional obliquy.</P>
<P>At length the ve&s;&s;el was ready, and never was there greater parade upon any &s;imilar occa&s;ion. She was launched with as much form and ceremony as a fir&s;t rate. A ball was given to the ladies, favours were worn, gla&s;&s;es were blown with the names of the &s;hip and commander, cut on their rims, Fan mounts carried her portrait; in &s;hort, expectation was never more a tip toe, nor was it ever better gra|tified. His &s;ucce&s;s was a&s;toni&s;hing, and
<PB N="55" REF="76">
he found him&s;elf pre&s;ently worth &s;even|teen thou&s;and pounds, his &s;hare of the prize money ari&s;ing from his different captures.</P>
<P>For my own part I grew as rich as a Jew, and as happy as a queen; for he was continually &s;ending me pre&s;ents, and would have had me come and live with him at Bri&s;tol, where, &s;ailor like, he had a hou&s;e open to all comers; but I was bound both by inclination and duty to &s;tay where I was; for, I own, I could not give over the hope I had of, once more, &s;eeing John Hewit; and then again, ex|changing a life of indu&s;try for a life of idlene&s;s, was little &s;uited to my ta&s;te; be|&s;ides I was an apprentice in a worthy fa|mily, and had my points of honour to con&s;ider as well as my brother had his.</P>
<P>This trade continued for a year and a half. At length, nothing was heard of my brother, nor his &s;hip, and the con|jectures
<PB N="56" REF="77">
of all his friends were that he was either lo&s;t, or taken. After I had been about three months in this &s;tate of uncertainty, I received, by the po&s;t, the following letter,</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MRS. HANNAH HIGGINS, LIVING AT MR. SMALLBROOK'S, MANUFACTURER, WOLVERHAMPTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MRS. HANNAH, MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;abled of the u&s;e of my right arm by rea&s;on of a wound from a &s;plinter in running under the fort of Vigo, I write by the hand of the gentleman, next in command, I being, by your brother's goodne&s;s, fir&s;t lieutenant, to let you know that I am very much afraid your brother's hanged; but don't be alarmed, let them hang him at their peril; if they do, I'll run up the two Spaniards at the yard arm, and &s;o I have &s;ent them word.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="78">
The thing is, your brother has been conquered by treachery, fair fighting would never have done it. La&s;t Satur|day was a fortnight, at two o'clock, P. M. we put into Vigo for water. Captain Higgins was invited a&s;hore by the go|vernor, in a very hand&s;ome manner, that I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, but let a Spaniard alone. They had, it &s;eems, declared war again&s;t England, and we being at &s;ea, never heard of it.</P>
<P>So after giving my captain a good dinner, he got a very pretty piece of news for his de&s;ert. They told him he was a pri&s;oner, and de&s;ired he would &s;end in|&s;tructions to me, his fir&s;t lieutenant, to de|liver up the &s;hip and cargo to two &s;warthy ra&s;cals of Spaniards that they &s;ent aboard of us. Captain Higgins, who always va|lued his owners' intere&s;t above his own, wrote on the margin, in a figure hand, that nobody under&s;tood but he and I, the&s;e words, 'Walme&s;ley don't regard what I
<PB N="58" REF="79">
have written above, but &s;lip your cable and out to &s;ea. Whatever becomes of me &s;hew your u&s;ual readine&s;s to oblige me by obeying my orders.'</P>
<P>I &s;cratched my head and looked like a fool. There was not a moment to lo&s;e. At la&s;t it came into my mind, that by keeping the two Spaniards we might &s;ave our captain. So I got them below, gave them &s;ome liqoeurs, notified my orders, and we were under a flowing top&s;ail in the &s;triking of a jack. As &s;oon as the Spaniards di&s;covered what we were after, they &s;aid I had better go back for that we &s;hould &s;ee captain Higgins hanging on the town walls. Well, &s;aid I, my lads, give a good look out, and if it be &s;o, run up the&s;e good gentlemen; that will be &s;ome revenge at any rate: two to one will be odds.</P>
<P>But now we had &s;omething el&s;e to think of, we were running under the fort,
<PB N="59" REF="80">
and gloriou&s;ly pepper us they did! But never mind that, I have brought the ve&s;&s;el &s;afely to Li&s;bon, Spaniards and all, and have applied to the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul, and he &s;ays he'll do what he can for us; and as I knew nothing would give your bro|ther &s;o much &s;atisfaction as relieving you from any unea&s;ine&s;s you might be under, upon his account, I have troubled you with the&s;e few lines, being all at pre&s;ent from,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your humble &s;ervant, CHARLES WALMESLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter gave me con&s;iderable un|ea&s;ine&s;s. The uncertainty of my brother's fate was a dreadful reflection to me, and there was little probability that I &s;hould be very &s;oon relieved from my &s;u&s;pen&s;e. But there were other circum&s;tances which cau&s;ed me many unplea&s;ant thoughts. This Charles Walme&s;ley my brother had in his letters repre&s;ented to me as a hand|&s;ome man, and a worthy character; and,
<PB N="60" REF="81">
indeed, in his plain, but &s;trongly affecti|onate manner, had reque&s;ted I would think of him as a hu&s;band, declaring that, if on their return I &s;hould like him, he would &s;hare his la&s;t &s;ixpence with us.</P>
<P>I certainly had a proper &s;en&s;e of his kindne&s;s, and turned the matter in my mind very frequently, but tho&s;e, who know any thing of love, will confe&s;s with me, that oppo&s;ition confirms his reign, and ob&s;tacles &s;erve only to &s;timulate his exertions. My brother's idea of a hand|&s;ome man might not be to my ta&s;te, and then all the world could not have bribed me to marry a &s;ailor; again, how to give up the flattering expectation of reforming poor Hewit, who was a hand&s;ome man to my ta&s;te. The&s;e and other reflections created a conflict in my mind between my wi&s;hes and tho&s;e of my brother. My excu&s;es to him, however, had been nothing more than that it was a &s;trange thing, even upon his recommendation, to fall in love with a
<PB N="61" REF="82">
man I had never &s;een, I might not think on the &s;ubject like him; that an agreeable companion to him on board &s;hip, might be ill calculated to make him&s;elf agreea|ble to me a&s;hore; and that it did not fol|low, becau&s;e he was a good &s;eaman, and an honourable character, he would make &s;uch a hu&s;band as I &s;hould approve of.</P>
<P>The&s;e excu&s;es were always combated with &s;uch &s;ort of an&s;wers, as &s;eemed as if he had &s;ome per&s;on who was a &s;py upon my actions, 'He knew my rea&s;ons&mdash;I did not like worth and honour; I liked profli|gacy, and a vagrant.' In &s;hort, he, at length, pofitively gave me to under&s;tand that he was perfectly acquainted with my partiality for Hewit; but a&s;&s;ured me, if ever I expected to receive any coun|tenance from him, I mu&s;t think of no other per&s;on than Walme&s;ley.</P>
<P>It came into my mind immediately, that Sourby was the cau&s;e of all this;
<PB N="62" REF="83">
for as every body had heard of my bro|ther, and even the new&s;papers in&s;tructed any body how to addre&s;s him, nothing could be ea&s;ier than for Sourby to give this information relative to me, which I had no doubt his malignant mind would induce him to repre&s;ent in every po&s;&s;ible way to my di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>It was at the time I was preparing to combat this treachery, which I had &s;o &s;aga|ciou&s;ly di&s;covered, that I received the let|ter from Walme&s;ley, which, I own, had a mo&s;t extraordinary effect on my mind. It was &s;o full of gratitude to my brother, &s;o per&s;onally brave, &s;o &s;en&s;ible as to conduct, and then, the poor fellow, with his arm in a &s;ling, to think of &s;ending me word of my brother's misfortune, not, apparently, out of &s;olicitude on my account, but becau&s;e he thought it would give his benefactor plea&s;ure, and all this without a word of love. If he had &s;een and known me ever &s;o, he could not have taken &s;o complete
<PB N="63" REF="84">
a method of intere&s;ting me in his favour. I own I felt this mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly; and &s;o little does human rea&s;on take reflection with it, that I wi&s;hed for a moment there was no &s;uch per&s;on in the world as John Hewit.</P>
<P>As I was con&s;trained to wait till my patience was fairly worne out before this matter was elucidated, I cannot do better than employ that tedious interval in &s;peak|ing of my other brother, who was as great a di&s;grace and reproach to me, as my elder brother was an honour, and a credit.</P>
<P>He was, as I have &s;aid already, ar|ticled to an attorney; but in&s;tead of bend|ing his mind to make his profe&s;&s;ion an in|&s;trument of comfort and convenience to his fellow creatures, his uniform &s;tudy was to harra&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s them. If he was &s;ent to &s;erve a writ, or levy an execution, it was not &s;ufficient to in&s;ult the poor wretch its &s;acrifice; he enjoyed with a de|te&s;tible plea&s;ure, the mi&s;ery of the wife,
<PB N="64" REF="85">
and the terror of the children; and with the mo&s;t ingenious cruelty, magnified their apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>His idea &s;eemed to be, that hardne&s;s of heart and &s;ubtilty were the only character|i&s;tic requi&s;ites in the practice of an attorney. But how he could acquire all this is a&s;to|ni&s;hing; for really Mr. Cleverly, with whom he lived, was a quiet worthy character, who had gone through life with great cre|dit and re&s;pectability, and then living at &s;o remote a part of the world! But I don't know how it is, there &s;eems to be an inherent &s;park of mental virus in our na|tures, that like the leaven in our con&s;ti|tutions, which is &s;aid to generate the &s;mall pox, when it comes in contact with that contagious malady, &s;tamps our minds beautiful, or deformed, according to its degree of &s;trength and influence. If we are but &s;lightly affected with it, our feel|ings reach no further than &s;olly, but if &s;everely, vice, and all its hideous train,
<PB N="65" REF="86">
mark every feature of the mind; and this was never more truly exemplified than in my brother, who, from an infant, be the game or play what it might, was &s;ure to get his companions into &s;ome litigation; till, at la&s;t, finding the country no place for &s;uch a&s;piring talents, he ran away from his ma&s;ter, who was glad enough to get rid of him, and arrived in London, the true &s;cene of action for genius like his.</P>
<P>From circum&s;tances that afterwards came to my knowledge, I am enabled to re|late the following particulars of him. When he fir&s;t arrived in town, his brother lawyers were &s;hy of him, fearing he might have been tainted in the country with fooli&s;h prejudices, or &s;cruples, but in a &s;hort time they became &s;o well convinced to the contrary, that he got a great deal of prac|tice as an agent; and it was very &s;oon re|marked, as a great feather in his cap, that he could &s;wear to a &s;ervice, puzzle a de|claration,
<PB N="66" REF="87">
in&s;truct a willing evidence, or &s;mooth an hone&s;t one, with any practitioner of his age belonging to the courts.</P>
<P>At length he began to figure away upon his own account; and, thanks to the vindictive &s;pirit of mankind, became flu&s;h of money. He turned his hand to every thing. He would parade the rece&s;&s;es of a pri&s;on, and drain the pur&s;es of the poor wretches immer&s;ed there, by advi&s;ing them to i&s;&s;ue &s;uper&s;edea&s;es, bring habeas cor|pu&s;es, or &s;ue for groats. He would court the alliance of Jews in Duke's Place, to be in&s;trumental in obtaining po&s;t obits, and purcha&s;ing annuities. He would be hou&s;e-advi&s;er to a bailiff the better to &s;queeze, and perplex the affairs of the debtors whom that bailiff might chance to have in his cu&s;tody. He would manufacture bankruptcies. He would connive at &s;windling, in &s;hort, there cannot be a nefarious villany which tho&s;e pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, pettifogging attornies
<PB N="67" REF="88">
perpetually practice, but he would, occa|&s;ionally, engage in, &s;o he could make it turn to account.</P>
<P>Having now prodigious practice, he married a woman he knew to have been kept by a man of fa&s;hion, who, he hoped, would pay her attention afterwards; that thus he might be able to hamper him in an action of <HI>crim. con.</HI> and either hu&s;h the matter up, by a hand&s;ome compo&s;ition, or recover large damages, &s;hould it be brought to trial; in which latter ca&s;e, he would be enabled to get rid of the woman, and marry another from the &s;ame views. He was, however, deceived in this, for &s;he made an hone&s;t wife in &s;pight of his teeth, which &s;o irritated him, that he beat her for not pro&s;ti|tuting her&s;elf; but upon her making a heavy complaint again&s;t him, he was obliged to con&s;ent to a &s;eparate main|tenance.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="89">
This circum&s;tance gave him not a little unea&s;ine&s;s, for &s;he was unavoidably in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of his &s;ecret practices. To get rid, therefore, of every ill con&s;e|quence that might ari&s;e from her di&s;cover|ing him, he connived at a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him&s;elf for a perjury, before &s;he could be ripe for any &s;uch attack, and thus, by properly preparing the evidence, he avoided all po&s;&s;ible danger, becau&s;e no man can be tried for the &s;ame offence a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>Of this crime every one believed him guilty; but &s;ince the law did not find him &s;o, mere opinions were to him of very little con&s;equence. In Newgate he was vi&s;ited by people of fa&s;hion; when he was acquitted, a hired rabble gave a &s;hout of applau&s;e, and he &s;pent that even|ing at one of the fir&s;t gaming hou&s;es in town, and though he was kicked out for want of money, he returned in a &s;hort
<PB N="69" REF="90">
time with his pockets well lined, and, afterwards reigned ma&s;ter of a Pharoah Bank, from whence he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he had &s;een men ri&s;e nabobs at night who had been beggars in the morning, and others beggars who in the morning had been nabobs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. TWO ATTEMPTS AT A RAPE UPON POOR HANNAH, ONE BY SOURBY, AND THE OTHER BY NOBODY KNOWS WHO, TOGETHER WITH THE HEROISM OF BINNS, AND THE ARRIVAL OF A STRANGER.</HEAD>
<P>MATTERS were in this &s;tate, my elder brother I knew not where, and my other brother I cared not where, when a very extraordinary circum&s;tance happened.&mdash;Sourby had, notwith&s;tanding his frequent repul&s;es, pe&s;tered me at times with his ful|&s;ome love; and, one day, made an at|tempt to violate my honour, when Binns re&s;cued me from his power, and gave him a &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement; after which, upon my threatening, at Mr. Smallbrook's de|&s;ire, to pro&s;ecute him for attempting to
<PB N="71" REF="92">
commit a rape, he left Wolverhampton, and we had not heard of him for a con&s;i|derable time.</P>
<P>Binns, who was rejoiced at his rival's ab&s;ence, paid me, after this, more parti|cular attention, and ventured, now and then, to hint, that if Hewit did not return, his a&s;&s;iduity might, probably, in the end, conquer my indifference.</P>
<P>Something I &s;aw plainly he was me|ditating; and one day, upon my treating him with more than ordinary civility, I thought I di&s;erned in his eyes a peculiar kind of &s;elf &s;atisfaction, like that which I have &s;poken of before to have been no|ticed by Clari&s;&s;a in the eyes of Lovelace. He being, however, a lover of a very different &s;tamp, I had no apprehen&s;ions upon this account; and having received, on his leaving me, a very di&s;agreeable piece of news, my mind was &s;o totally
<PB N="72" REF="93">
ab&s;orbed in it, that Binns, and the whole conver&s;ation went out of my head.</P>
<P>The intelligence I received was, that one Mrs. Crow, a poor old &s;oul, who had been Mi&s;s Williams's nur&s;e, and whom, on that account, as well as her being a mo&s;t pious and good woman, I treated, as far as my circum&s;tances could permit me, with every attention and kindne&s;s in my power, was taken dangerou&s;ly ill and re|que&s;ted to &s;ee me. This was in the after|noon, and as it was winter time, and Mrs. Crow lived two miles out of town, it was nearly dark before I reached her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To my very great a&s;toni&s;hment I found her in perfect health; at which I was &s;o delighted, that I had chatted away &s;ome time before I con&s;idered this falfe intelligence mu&s;t have been &s;ent me with &s;ome bad de&s;ign. Mrs. Crow joined me in this opinion, and we determined that I
<PB N="73" REF="94">
&s;hould &s;tay there all night, for it was now quite dark, when who &s;hould come in but the very man who had brought me the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We both began que&s;tioning him, and were informed that Binns had &s;ent him; and as I had paid him hand&s;omely, for he was a kind of errand man, and, occa&s;ion|ally, a porter in the town, he &s;aid, he had come him&s;elf to &s;ee how poor Mrs. Crow did, and to know if he could render her any further &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o ingenuous in this confe&s;&s;ion, that, without he&s;itation, I agreed that he &s;hould be my guide home, for, after all, there was &s;ome work to be given out early in the morning, which no|body could fit but my&s;elf, and, however, &s;atisfied I might be as to Mr. Smallbrook's con&s;ideratene&s;s, I made it a rule never to neglect his bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s upon any pre&s;&s;|ing occa&s;ion; as this would have been,
<PB N="74" REF="95">
had it not been cleared up, in which ca&s;e he would have blamed me for &s;tanding upon &s;o much ceremony.</P>
<P>As to Binns, I own, I never was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed in my life as at what I had heard, but I did not &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ingular as his conduct was, I had any thing to appre hend from it, becau&s;e he had always ap|peared to me to be a man of &s;trict honour; be&s;ides I was well guarded, and I felt a peculiar impul&s;e, which never in my life has deceived me, that I &s;hould come to no harm.</P>
<P>It was uncommonly dark, and if my guide had not been furni&s;hed with a lan|tern by Mrs. Crow, we &s;hould &s;carcely been able to &s;ind our way. For a good di&s;tance we went on pretty well, but there was &s;omething, at la&s;t, in the bu&s;ine&s;s I did not like. The fellow was every mi|nute crying out hu&s;h, don't you hear a noi&s;e? And this when there was no cau&s;e
<PB N="75" REF="96">
for apprehen&s;ion; and, therefore, it mu&s;t have been to frighten me, By and bye, when we came exactly to that part of Love-lane, where Jenny Rhodes &s;tabbed Su&s;an Wingrove, he cried out&mdash;'Lord have mercy upon us,' fell down, and ex|tingui&s;hed the light.</P>
<P>Full of vexation, and, indeed, &s;u&s;pi|cion, I groped about, and called to the man, but received no an&s;wer. I had very little time to deliberate, when a man caught me in his arms and began to grow very rude. I &s;creamed out&mdash;'Hu&s;h,' cried he, in a whi&s;per, 'don't you know me? I am Binns&mdash;I can no longer re&s;i&s;t my pa&s;&s;ion for you, and this moment &s;hall witne&s;s my happine&s;s.'</P>
<P>He &s;poke not another word, but began to treat me with &s;uch violent rudene&s;s, that in &s;pight of all my re&s;i&s;tance, I began to entertain the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions.
<PB N="76" REF="97">
I entreated, prayed, &s;creamed, &s;truggled; till at length my &s;trength became totally exhau&s;ted, and I fainted away.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this &s;ituation when the voice of Binns, for he &s;poke loud enough now, reiterated in my ears. He &s;eemed &s;o rejoiced at my returning to life, that I thought the man would have gone mad with plea&s;ure. As I was per|fectly convinced my honour was &s;afe, I took this for repentance, and &s;everely lectured him for his &s;trange and violent conduct. He called Heaven to witne&s;s he had u&s;ed no &s;uch conduct towards me, but on the contrary, had been &s;o fortunate as to re&s;cue me, once more, from the hands of a ravi&s;her.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was glad of any thing that had induced him to repent of his brutality, but that what he uttered was fal&s;e, for it was plain he had not only &s;ent the &s;ham
<PB N="77" REF="98">
me&s;&s;age, but had tutored the man, who brought it, how to betray me into his power.</P>
<P>He declared, by all that was &s;acred, he did not comprehend me, and was going on when a man, with a lantern in his hand, came running up to us; and having held the light fir&s;t to Binns's face, and then to mine, cried, 'I have not &s;trength to &s;up|port my&s;elf!' and fell down.</P>
<P>We now left off our altercation, and began to inquire into the &s;ituation of the poor fallen man, but we had not pur&s;ued our good offices a moment, when &s;eeing a number of people come towards us with lights, Binns cried out, ''Tis he, Hannah, as &s;ure as you are born, 'tis John Hewit!'</P>

<P>A po&s;&s;ee now came up. They con|&s;i&s;ted of pari&s;h officers, con&s;tables, and a number of idle people, who were col|lected together out of curio&s;ity. We learnt that they were conveying &s;ome paupers to the workhou&s;e, which was &s;ituate about a quarter of a mile further, one of the&s;e was John Hewit, who had been &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex; and upon telling his name and pari&s;h, had been pa&s;&s;ed home as a vagrant. They added, that on hearing &s;ome per&s;on at a di&s;tance &s;cream violently, they were com|ing up as expediciou&s;ly as they could, but not fa&s;t enough for Hewit's impatience; who, weak as he was, &s;natched a lantern out of the con&s;table's hand, and ran to|wards
<PB N="79" REF="100">
us with &s;uch &s;peed, that the effort overcame him in the manner before de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Binns &s;aid he had been told of this circum&s;tance, and was going to the work|hou&s;e to u&s;e his be&s;t intere&s;t for Hewit's accommodation, when he al&s;o heard a &s;creaming; and, being con&s;iderably nearer, was fortunate enough to lend me the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I &s;tood in need of.</P>
<P>I gave Binns's declaration what degree of credit I thought proper; but chu&s;ing, at pre&s;ent, to agree to this interpretation of his conduct, I an&s;wered the various en|quiries that were made in &s;uch a way as induced the by &s;tanders to believe that I had been &s;et upon by &s;ome robber, and re&s;cued by the gallantry of Binns, who &s;eemed, in their opinion, to be born for my champion, for there was no per&s;on pre&s;ent who had not heard of his pre&s;erv|ing
<PB N="80" REF="101">
my honour from the rude attempts of Sourby.</P>
<P>A number of &s;agacious ob&s;ervations were now made, &s;ome of them not very good natured; one &s;aid that, "Love-lane was a very good place for people to meet in the dark." Another &s;aid, "Some peo|ple &s;queaked out when nobody was a hurting them." One talked &s;omething about mock mode&s;ty; another, "What a fine thing it was to be a favourite of the ladies." To all which Binns made very &s;uitable an&s;wers. As to my&s;elf, I was in|volved in &s;uch a train of thinking that I had neither &s;pirits, nor ability to make any reply, and if I had wi&s;hed to do &s;o, perhaps, my contempt would have with|held me; and as for poor Hewit, who &s;eemed very ill, he appeared to li&s;ten to the whole in &s;ullen &s;ilence.</P>
<P>As this &s;trange &s;cene wore more and
<PB N="81" REF="102">
more a very &s;erious complexion, I ha&s;tened to put a &s;top to it; and de&s;iring Binns to accompany me home, I parted from this motley tribe, fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring Hewit that I would mention his ca&s;e that very evening to Mr. Smallbrook, who I had no doubt would do every thing in his power to &s;erve him. He &s;eemed &s;carcely to thank me, and we parted.</P>
<P>Going home I in&s;i&s;ted upon an ex|planation from Binns, of all his &s;trange conduct; telling him, as circum&s;tances I &s;uppo&s;ed he mu&s;t have known, of every thing I knew relative to the fal&s;e me&s;&s;age, and Benjamin Dark the me&s;&s;enger's com|ing to Mrs. Crow's, which had occa&s;ioned all that had happened in Love-lane.</P>
<P>He declared, mo&s;t &s;olemnly, that what he had before told me was the literal truth. He &s;aid he had heard in the morn|ing, from the ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e, that Hewit and &s;ome other paupers, who
<PB N="82" REF="103">
had been examined at the Quarter Se&s;&s;ions for the county, were that day expected; that it had immediately &s;truck him he cer|tainly, now, could have no chance of gaining my affection, and, therefore, the utmo&s;t he &s;hould expect would be my friend&s;hip, which, he &s;aid, he was deter|mined to de&s;erve by every means in his power; that to effect this, he was re&s;olved to do every thing he could to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t Hewit, that he was even delighted with his project, which, he declared, had given him more &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure than ever he had felt in his life, and it was this very plea&s;ure that infu&s;ed into his countenance the confident &s;atisfaction, of which the reader may remember I had taken &s;uch particular notice in the morn|ing; &s;o that, for that time, my &s;agacity was fallible.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he would have returned to the workhou&s;e after &s;eeing me home; but from the temper Hewit &s;eemed then to be
<PB N="83" REF="104">
in, it was better let alone; be&s;ides, the ma&s;ter was his particular friend, and would be &s;ure to pay Hewit every po&s;&s;ible atten|tion; and, after all, one night was &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed, and in the morning there could be no doubt but matters would be cleared to the &s;atisfaction of every body.</P>
<P>Admitting all this to be truth, it &s;hould appear that this Benjamin Dark was the ruffian who had &s;et upon me. In which ca&s;e he mu&s;t have made u&s;e of Binns's name, as the mo&s;t likely per&s;on I would, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, have relied upon; and it now &s;truck me, that as the fellow came at different times on bu&s;ine&s;s to our hou&s;e, he u&s;ed to venture at &s;ome awkward com|pliments, and pa&s;s &s;ome rough jokes that &s;eemed, then, to have nothing particular in them, but which appeared, now, to mean, &s;uppo&s;ing Binns to have told the truth, a good deal.</P>
<P>The morning, however, was to eluci|date
<PB N="84" REF="105">
every thing, to that the di&s;pute was referred. Binns a&s;&s;ured me he would find Dark and confront him face to face, and de&s;ired I would form no favourable opinion of his conduct but in proportion as it &s;hould appear unobjectionable from an impartial inve&s;tigation of it.</P>
<P>This was &s;o fair, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to object to it. I wi&s;hed him a good night, and retired to bed with a more per|turbed mind than I had ever before ex|perienced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. THE MYSTERY OF THE RAPE LEADS TO ANOTHER MYSTERY OF A MORE COMPLEX KIND; WHICH NOT ONLY POSES THE SAGACITY OF HANNAH, BUT OF ALL WOLVERHAMPTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT will very ea&s;ily be credited that I &s;carcely clo&s;ed my eyes the whole night. A variety of conflicting ideas agitated my mind, and I very plainly &s;aw I was in &s;uch a &s;ituation that I had need of a protector. My talents were &s;uch an ob|ject of envy, and my conduct was &s;o ex|emplary, that I had no doubt, if I con|tinued long in a &s;ingle &s;tate, but the vul|gar malignity of the wretches, who had too little principle to imitate me, would, one day or other, induce them to fabricate
<PB N="86" REF="107">
&s;ome lie, with &s;uch artful circum&s;tances, as might gain general credit; and then all my towering pro&s;pects of &s;uperiority would vani&s;h into air.</P>
<P>From all tho&s;e combatting con&s;idera|tions, I thought it incumbent on me to form an immediate re&s;olution. John Hewit was now come back; on him I had &s;et my heart: What then? I could not make the fir&s;t declaration; and though he would find plenty of informers, of whom he would learn that my name, on his ac|count, had been finely bandied about in his ab&s;ence; yet, it did not follow, that this would appear a matter of any moment to him; his &s;trange conduct, the night be|fore, had given me no expectation that it would; and after all he might be married him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I determined, therefore, whatever might have been my former thoughts, that if there was any un&s;urmountable bar to my
<PB N="87" REF="108">
union with Hewit, it &s;till &s;hould not hinder me, qualified as I was, from &s;ettling in life. The next object, therefore, that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf was Walme&s;ley; whom, yet why, or wherefore, I did not know, I could not get out of my head. A match with him would gratify my brother; and then he appeared to be &s;uch a worthy, good crea|ture! but then, where was he? and again, if he were to return, how could I bear to think of marrying a &s;ailor; And it was very little likely that he would give up his profe&s;&s;ion on my account.</P>
<P>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Walme&s;ley from my mind, I was naturally led to think of Binns, who I certainly had a mo&s;t &s;incere friend&s;hip for; and who, if he made out the &s;tory of Love-lane in his favour, had really many and various calls upon my gratitude; but I don't know how it was, I never thought of him as a hu&s;band without &s;hud|dering. He was a very well looking young man; and people would &s;ay, by
<PB N="88" REF="109">
way of low wit, that after all, Hewit &s;tood no chance; for any body might &s;ee Binns and Hannah Higgins would be man and wife, they were &s;o alike each other.</P>
<P>Thus I went on tormenting my&s;elf, and putting this que&s;tion into every po&s;&s;ible point of view; my poor heart, like the faith|ful needle, reverting perpetually to John Hewit, the only point that had any at|traction for it.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely breakfa&s;ted when Binns came to inform me, that Benjamin Dark had made his e&s;cape in the night, and had taken with him &s;everal letters and notes, with which he had been, as was very cu&s;to|mery, entru&s;ted to deliver to the po&s;t|office; and, added, that as his hone&s;ty had never been before impeached, and it was impo&s;&s;ible he could have addre&s;s enough to pa&s;s the&s;e notes, the gen|tleman, who had &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s, con|jectured that he was only an in&s;trument in
<PB N="89" REF="110">
the hands of &s;ome more artful per&s;on, and they were, therefore, drawing up a proper hand bill to circulate all over the country, &s;o that whoever &s;hould be concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s might be detected.</P>
<P>Binns &s;aid, that he hoped the alacrity he &s;hould &s;hew in forwarding this detec|tion, would &s;erve to acquit him, in my opinion, of any improper intention as to his conduct of the evening before; and, added, that as Hewit was come back, and there could be no chance of obtaining my heart, he would with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure exert his utmo&s;t endeavours to bring about our union; in effecting which, though he &s;hould, of cour&s;e, lo&s;e all pro&s;pect of be|ing my lover, he hoped he &s;hould merit, by his a&s;&s;iduity, &s;o far my e&s;teem that I might con&s;ider him as a brother.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o truly noble in the whole of this declaration, that I thanked him in the hand&s;ome&s;t terms for
<PB N="90" REF="111">
his uncommon kindne&s;s, and &s;incere friend|&s;hip; and a&s;&s;ured him, that whoever po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed my love, I &s;hould ever con&s;ider him, in the highe&s;t degree, entitled to my gra|titude.</P>
<P>He now undertook to vi&s;it Hewit, and completely to overcome, in his mind, whatever prejudices he might have im|bibed from what he had &s;een and heard in Love-lane; which, no doubt, had been &s;ufficiently exaggerated &s;ince. This con|ver&s;ation, he &s;aid, he would manage with the propere&s;t delicacy towards me, which would &s;pare me a great deal of awkward embarra&s;&s;ment, and he would afterwards take care to inform me of the &s;tate of Hewit's mind, that I might make up my own &s;o as to act according to circum|&s;tances,</P>
<P>The beneficence, mingled in this friend&s;hip, brought tears into my eyes. Whoever I marry, &s;aid I, God &s;end,
<PB N="91" REF="112">
for the &s;ake of my &s;u&s;ceptible heart, that he may have a mind like yours; and yet, &s;aid I, 'Mr. Binns, &s;o capricious is hu|man nature, though I highly value you for your noble &s;entiments, and count your friend&s;hip as the highe&s;t compliment that was ever paid from exalted worth, to un|protected honour, if there was not another man upon the face of the earth, I don't know how it is, but pray be not offended at my frankne&s;s, I could not think of you as a hu&s;band.'</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had long &s;een it, and &s;o far from being offended at my frankne&s;s, he admired it. He then took leave of me to go to Hewit; and in the afternoon, when he called upon me again, informed me that he could not tell what to make of his emba&s;&s;y; Hewit had &s;aid, that it was his intention to return to his ma&s;ter, who, he had no doubt, when all the hard&s;hips he had undergone were con&s;idered, would not be aver&s;e to receiving him, as it was
<PB N="92" REF="113">
now very much his wi&s;h to &s;tick to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and make up for lo&s;t time; but that he did not chu&s;e to owe this favour, or any other, to any per&s;on's &s;olicitation whatever.</P>
<P>Binns &s;aid he had but an awkard account to give of his love negociation, which he had determined to enter upon collaterally, collecting what he had to ga|ther from Hewit, by introducing a con|ver&s;ation on the adventures of the night before. Hewit did not &s;eem to place an implicit faith in what Binns advanced; on the contrary, gave hints, according to his idea, not much to my advantage, &s;ay|ing, 'he had heard a little of the young lady's conduct, for he had &s;ailed in her brother's &s;hip, and had there learnt that &s;he was promi&s;ed to one Walme&s;ley, her brother's fir&s;t lieutenant.'</P>
<P>How Hewit came aboard the &s;hip, I could not po&s;&s;ibly conceive, but this ap|peared
<PB N="93" REF="114">
to unravel the &s;trange circum|&s;tance of that intelligence which my bro|ther had got relative to my &s;entiments. I no longer blamed Sourby; for the blame, if any, was clearly imputable to Hewit him&s;elf, who, very naturally, did what he could to combat Walme&s;ley's preten&s;ions, the better to e&s;tabli&s;h his own; and, I confe&s;s, I felt my&s;elf flattered at the cir|cum&s;tance, for it proved, whatever might be his &s;ullenne&s;s at pre&s;ent, that his thoughts had been occupied on me; and, again, the adroit means he mu&s;t have u&s;ed to manage this, &s;o as not to di&s;cover he was the very Hewit, had not only the fer|vour, but the ingenuity of love; and, therefore, proved that his &s;entiments of me were as favourable as I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I told Binns that my brother had cer|tainly made me a propo&s;al to marry Walme&s;ley, who had done his duty no|bly and honourably, but as he was a per|&s;on I had never &s;een, I had no doubt but,
<PB N="94" REF="115">
upon a proper repre&s;entation of the mat|ter, he would be ea&s;ily induced to forego his inten&s;ion in favour of Hewit, who, in this in&s;tance, of happening to be on board his &s;hip, might, perhaps, have done his du|ty too. More conver&s;ation, of this kind, pa&s;&s;ed, and Binns reiterated his promi&s;es of friend&s;hip and &s;ervices with great warmth, and after making &s;ome arrange|ment, as to the mode of managing matters concerning Hewit, we parted.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I heard the next morn|ing was, that Binns had gone unexpectedly to London the night before. I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at this extraordinary intelli|gence, that I begged Mr. Smallbrook would enquire of his uncle, with whom I before mentioned he was in partner&s;hip, what could po&s;&s;ibly have cau&s;ed &s;o unex|pected an event; the uncle &s;aid, for an|&s;wer, that it had originated from a very &s;ingular mi&s;take. He had received in|formation that a con&s;iderable hou&s;e, with
<PB N="95" REF="116">
which he was connected in town, was on the eve of failing; and that by a &s;peedy application for a &s;ettlement of accounts, perhaps, their concerns would e&s;cape the general wreck.</P>
<P>The uncle &s;aid, that, upon this news, his nephew had &s;eemed very anxious to make the application in per&s;on, becau&s;e, being a party, he could more immediately act as nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould point out, than if the matter was conducted by an agent. He thought, he &s;aid, that there was a par|ticular earne&s;tne&s;s in this zeal, which he greatly commended him for, and he imme|diately con&s;ented to his &s;etting out; but, he added, that the precaution was from fir&s;t to la&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary; for he had that morning not only received remittances, which &s;et him perfectly at ea&s;e, as to the &s;olvency of the concern, but large orders on their own account, as well as from other re&s;pectable hou&s;es through their re|commendation.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="117">
He &s;aid, whence this curious bu&s;ine&s;s could originate, he was at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s, but his nephew would, in a minute di&s;co|ver the fraud, and of cour&s;e take coach and come back again. This prediction, however, was not verified, for he did not return, nor have I &s;et eyes on him but once, and that but for a moment, and by a mere accident, from that time to this.</P>
<P>The fal&s;e intelligence, in the cour&s;e of a few days, was attributed to Binns him|&s;elf; &s;o was the fal&s;e me&s;&s;age I had re|ceived through Benjamin Dark; and, in|deed, now was the embezzlement of the notes; for, otherwi&s;e, how could it have been worth his while to have, left a repu|table bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he had a hand&s;ome concern, for he did not appear to have taken any con&s;iderable property, or &s;um of money of his own.</P>
<P>And, indeed, this involved the bu&s;i|ne&s;s in complete my&s;tery. His character
<PB N="97" REF="118">
had been the faire&s;t that ever was known. His uncle had a great value for him, and intended, when he had once &s;ettled, to have retired and left him and his &s;i&s;ter the whole concern, fir&s;t drawing a hand&s;ome income out of it for his own &s;upport.</P>
<P>Having, perhaps, more charity than my neighbours, I was, on the&s;e accounts, the la&s;t that yielded to what every day's ob&s;ervation &s;eemed to confirm, for which I was not a little reflected on. It was &s;aid I mu&s;t be out of my &s;en&s;es. If he had not embezzled the notes, who had? If he had not made Benjamin Dark the in|&s;trument of his intention to ruin me, who had? In &s;hort, I could not help, at la&s;t, inclining towards the general opinion; and as the mo&s;t natural excu&s;e I could make for him, I attributed all his conduct to his love for me, which had induced him to contrive a plan for my ruin, he had not the heart to accompli&s;h, to take, after|wards, the &s;upererogate, and romantic re|&s;olution
<PB N="98" REF="119">
of bringing about my union with Hewit; and in &s;hort, of forming all tho&s;e &s;trange and non&s;en&s;ical re&s;olutions, which could enter the head of no man out of Bedlam, except a man in love.</P>
<P>Yet to take leave of his principles as well as his friends, was a thing beyond my comprehen&s;ion; no young man upon earth ever went &s;o far into life with a more unblemi&s;hed character. He was quoted as an example for all the men, and admired and e&s;teemed among the worthy part of the women; nay, he was the la&s;t in the world to profit by the folly he had com|mitted, for he knew nothing of trick, or deceit, and all tho&s;e who valued him, who were not a few, in Wolverhampton, na|turally expected that he would manage the accompli&s;hment of his fraud &s;o awk|wardly, that they &s;hould hear of his being detected and brought back.</P>
<P>Nothing of this, however, happened.
<PB N="99" REF="120">
The intelligence we got of Binns was that he was &s;et down &s;afely in the Borough; and &s;hortly afterwards left the inn to go, as he &s;aid, into the city, but that he never returned; and, in the mean time, as the money for &s;everal of the notes had been received before proper intelligence could be &s;ent to &s;top their payment, the mo&s;t probable conjecture was, that he had gone abroad. All this appeared &s;o fea&s;ible to the uncle, that though he was under no obligation &s;o to do, he declared, that if his nephew did not return in a twelve-month and a day, and if in the mean time the gentlemen who were lo&s;ers upon this account, did not receive &s;ome &s;atisfactory rea&s;on to render it unnece&s;&s;ary, he would, rather than throw a &s;lur upon his family, reimbur&s;e their lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This hand&s;ome conduct &s;o operated, that the hand bill was not publi&s;hed, le&s;t Binns might be apprehended, and &s;uffer an ignominious death. I own none of the&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="121">
circum&s;tances plea&s;ed me, I could not from my &s;oul fully believe him guilty; and though it &s;o happened that this fraud was committed exactly at the time when his incon&s;iderate love for me induced him to leave his friends, there was &s;uch in|herent goodne&s;s in his compo&s;ition, that I could not reconcile to my&s;elf how one and the &s;ame man could be a valuable member of &s;ociety and a vile cheat.</P>
<P>I knew, however, that my feeble voice, had I exerted it, would have had but little weight again&s;t a whole town, who were every day hearing, or forging &s;ome fre&s;h proof of his guilt, a circum&s;tance to me, of all others, a&s;toni&s;hing; but it never, in any in&s;tance, proved to be otherwi&s;e, for circulate a &s;tory to a man's advantage, &s;ee, if credited at all, with what reluctance it is credited; and then he has done no more than he ought; whereas, accu&s;e the be&s;t man in the world of a nefarious act, and the very &s;u&s;picion &s;hall hunt him to his

grave. Some 'thought it would come to that,' others 'had &s;u&s;pected it a good while before;' in &s;hort, a thou&s;and undand&s;ome and unfeeling hints and &s;neers are in|&s;inuated about; and though the unfortu|nate wretch may have done many po&s;itive acts to merit e&s;teem and admiration, yet this one implied crime is a blot large enough to eclip&s;e all his virtues, and, in the mid&s;t of friends, he may die for want of an advocate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. HANNAH RECEIVES A VISIT FROM MISS BINNS, WHO PERPLEXES MATTERS A LITTLE MORE. THIS NAIL IS CLINCHED BY A LETTER FROM DARK.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS tormented with the&s;e cogitations when my &s;weet friend, Mi&s;s Binns, called on me, and &s;aid, &s;he had &s;omething very particular to communicate to me; before, however, I inform the reader what the na|ture of her bu&s;ine&s;s was, I &s;hall go into &s;ome particulars relative to that young lady, with whom I had uncea&s;ingly con|tinued on a footing of intimacy, though other matters of more immediate import|ance to this hi&s;tory, have hitherto pre|vented me from noticing it.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="124">
I have already mentioned that the wi|dow Gregory took Binns and his &s;i&s;ter un|der her protection, as well to keep their manners from being tainted by the influ|ence of tho&s;e bad examples before their eyes in the conduct of their profligate fa|ther, as to re&s;cue her maiden name of Binns from oblivion; for the old lady be|ing of Welch extraction, was not a little proud of her ance&s;tors, though her genea|logical tree had a very uncertain root, and was now &s;o blighted that it boa&s;ted but one branch, and that a very rotten one. Seeing the young &s;cion, Binns, however, &s;hoot from it &s;trong, hand&s;ome, and full of vigour, &s;he was determined to tran&s;plant it into her own nur&s;ery, where, by her fo&s;|tering care, it might improve and flouri&s;h, and, at length, re&s;tore the tree to its pri&s;|tine luxuriance.</P>
<P>This was the widow's darling contem|plation; and though &s;he was a very good woman, 'tis more than probable, had there
<PB N="104" REF="125">
been no &s;on in the ca&s;e, her brother's chil|dren would not have been removed from Coalbrook Dale to Wolverhampton.&mdash;Thus Binns's fortune was her peculiar care; but finding in his &s;i&s;ter every thing &s;he could wi&s;h for that was amiable, and dutiful, &s;he, at her death, made no di&s;|tinction between them.</P>
<P>The affection of Mi&s;s Binns for her brother, was of &s;o tender a nature, that it bordered upon the romantic. She was jealous of every one, to whom he paid par|ticular attention, and refu&s;ed, for his &s;ake, every offer made to her. She certainly had a warm and &s;incere friend&s;hip for me, but I am convinced it aro&s;e from my uni|form and immoveable determination, not to con&s;ider Binns in the light of a lover; otherwi&s;e, I have no doubt, but I &s;hould have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very little of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The unlimited confidence between us frequently gave me opportunity of ex|po&s;tulating

I repre&s;ented to her that it was very natural, and very laudable to love a brother; but it was the duty of a &s;i&s;ter to wi&s;h that a brother &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in the world, and that the good of &s;ociety called upon her to do the &s;ame; be&s;ides, if her brother did not marry, what would become of the Welch pedigree.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wer was, &s;he loved goodne&s;s and honour, and, therefore, &s;he loved her brother; that &s;he did not think any woman could de&s;erve him; that, as to her&s;elf, it would be time enough to think of a hu&s;band when he had got a wife; and as to her aunt's projects, as &s;he had not lived to &s;ee them fulfilled, it was no great matter, in her opinion, even if they never were to be fulfilled at all.</P>
<P>This was the character of Mi&s;s Binns, who now came to me to make an important di&s;covery. She told me, that from &s;ome my&s;terious circum&s;tances, &s;he had lately be|come
<PB N="106" REF="127">
acquainted with, there appeared very little doubt of her brother's guilt; but even were he guilty to the utmo&s;t extent of what had been &s;u&s;pected, there was &s;till &s;omething amiable in the motive, though egregiou&s;ly weak and unpardonable in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>She gave me to under&s;tand that her brother had become a &s;acrifice to filial duty. She had known, over and above the money her father received through Mr. Williams, which her aunt had en|joined them both never to augment, that Binns had privately &s;upplied him with &s;ums at different times and had al&s;o paid &s;everal debts. This &s;he did not blame; for, in fact, &s;he had winked at it; but &s;he began at la&s;t to be &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y, for he had not only had many interviews with his father, at a di&s;tance from town, but had encouraged him to come clande&s;tinely to his uncle's, where they were perpetually clo&s;eted, as if concerting &s;ome &s;cheme. Nay, the very night before he went to London, &s;he &s;aw him let him out through
<PB N="107" REF="128">
a back garden, and heard him &s;ay, "Be faithful to me, and this bu&s;ine&s;s will make your fortune."</P>
<P>Upon a further enquiry &s;he had learnt that the father was gone off as well as the &s;on. She had, therefore, very &s;trong rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he had been enthralled by the artful machinations of a parent to commit a crime which, though the tran&s;ac|tion ba&s;&s;led common &s;en&s;e, and &s;et pro|bability at defiance, appeared, neverthe|le&s;s, to be true; fir&s;t, by his flight, then by his father's; and, again, becau&s;e there was no trace of a di&s;covery by which it could attach to any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>She &s;aid that &s;he came to me as the true&s;t friend &s;he had, to confide in me her &s;u&s;picions, and the cau&s;e of them, and to a&s;k my advice, as to whether it was proper to acquaint her uncle Gregory with them; I &s;aid, that after his generous conduct, I &s;hould con&s;ider it a very blameable thing, indeed, if &s;he concealed from him a &s;ingle
<PB N="108" REF="129">
&s;yllable. She, at length, agreed with me, and after laying together every thing we could devi&s;e to excu&s;e Binns, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of &s;ucce&s;s, we promi&s;ed to continue kind friends to each other, and parted.</P>
<P>About a week afterwards I received the following letter, which I &s;hall give to the reader exactly as it was written.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF JOHN HEWIT&mdash;A HINT, OR TWO, CONCERNING SUNDAY SCHOOLS&mdash;AND SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO CAPTAIN HIG|GINS AND CHARLES WALMESLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now &s;peak of Hewit, who two days after he came to Wolverhampton, was taken extremely ill at his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, where he had received a mo&s;t cordial wel|come.
<PB N="112" REF="132">
I could not, with any propriety, vi&s;it him my&s;elf, but I prevailed on Mrs. Crow, to &s;ee him, and do every thing in her power to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This tru&s;t I knew &s;he would di&s;charge, in every re&s;pect, to my &s;atisfaction, for &s;he was ac|quainted with my intentions relative to Hewit, and approved of them; and hav|ing this opportunity of being near him, &s;he did not &s;ail to avail her&s;elf of it.</P>
<P>Her excu&s;e for calling on him was, that as he had formerly been taken by the hand by Par&s;on Williams, &s;he was &s;ure it would give the good Vicar plea&s;ure to hear of his determination to leave off wandering, and become a &s;ober man.&mdash;From this &s;he would take occa&s;ion to ad|vert to the good that gentleman had done in the neighbourhood, and how many thoughtle&s;s young people would have been thrown away if he had not intere&s;ted him|&s;elf in their favour. This gave her an op|portunity of noticing what a credit I had
<PB N="113" REF="133">
been to his recommendation, and how much I was the admiration of the whole place, with the exception, indeed, of a few worthle&s;s people, who&s;e good, or ill word, it was not worth my while to concern my|&s;elf about.</P>
<P>He replied very little to all this at fir&s;t, but as he grew better, he became very curious about me. He had heard, as I &s;aid before, many &s;tories he did not like, told with an invidious intention; and, in particular, he could not &s;tomach the la&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in Love-lane; but the good old lady &s;et him right in every re&s;pect; and, at la&s;t, he profe&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee me, adding, he had &s;omething very particular, indeed, to &s;ay to me concerning my bro|ther.</P>
<P>I had been told, as the reader knows, of Hewit's being on board my brother's &s;hip, and had made my own remarks on his conduct in relation to Walme&s;ley; but it
<PB N="114" REF="134">
now &s;truck me that he had told Binns my brother was determined I &s;hould marry Walme&s;ley, and I imagined he wanted to &s;ee how my &s;entiments were on that &s;ub|ject. I, therefore, longed for an inter|view with him, be&s;ides, I thought it po&s;&s;i|ble that he might give me &s;ome account of my brother, who I much wi&s;hed to hear of.</P>
<P>As he was now able to walk out, I agreed to meet him at Mrs. Crow's hou&s;e, where, every Sunday, it was my cu&s;tom to in&s;truct poor children in their &s;piritual and temporal duty. It had always been my idea, that if the labouring people had &s;ome rational mode of employing the Sun|day, they would be le&s;s inclined to fre|quent alehou&s;es, and get into debauchery, particularly in manufacturing towns. I u&s;ed, therefore, by way of an example for others, better enabled, both as to abili|ties and means, than my&s;elf, to teach as many children as appeared de&s;irous of improving them&s;elves in reading, writing,
<PB N="115" REF="135">
arithmetic, and in &s;hort, whatever might be nece&s;&s;ary for the common purpo&s;es of life; and that it might not be all labour, I added, by way of amu&s;ement, a little mu&s;ic, &s;uch as hymns, anthems, and ora|torios; I believe, through me, Wolver|hampton was the fir&s;t place where the works of the immortal Handel were in|troduced, which are now &s;o well known, and under&s;tood in country towns.</P>
<P>It had often occurred to me, that all minds ought to be enlightened; that hu|man creatures were all made of the &s;ame materials; and that nature, in her general endowments, paid no regard to rank and di&s;tinction, but that &s;he often gifted with &s;trong intellects the mean and lowly, and branded with gro&s;s ignorance the high and dignified; that great talents, and brilliant genius, were as unconfined as the heavenly e&s;&s;ence that in&s;pired them, and that the genial &s;un delights to &s;hine as re&s;plend|antly on a cottage as on a palace.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="136">
I had no doubt but this philanthropic &s;cheme of mine would, one day or other, be univer&s;ally adopted; and, indeed, be|fore the fatal day I left my native coun|try, I had the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it, in an infant &s;tate, carried into effect. If it &s;hould have generally ob|tained at the time I am now writing, I have no doubt but it has operated to the honour of morality, the promotion of in|du&s;try, and the advantage of order and good government. There were certainly, however, &s;ome who did not &s;pare to &s;ay, but envy will always be cavilling, that were this the ca&s;e, it would become a &s;e|rious and an alarming evil; for as there are never wanting malignant &s;pirits, who hatch infernal de&s;igns to &s;ap the foundation of dome&s;tic quiet, and make men &s;werve from their different duties of hu&s;band, fa|ther, friend, and &s;ubject; &s;o, if ever any &s;uch wretch, to gratify his own helli&s;h purpo&s;es, &s;hould wi&s;h to unhinge order, and introduce anarchy, he had nothing to
<PB N="117" REF="137">
do but &s;peciou&s;ly to appeal without truth, without argument, without common &s;en&s;e, to the bewildered imaginations of the mul|titude, through the medium of that very &s;uperficial and ineffectual information with which I had a&s;toni&s;hed, but not convinced their minds.</P>
<P>But this futile ob&s;ervation refutes it|&s;elf; and though it is impo&s;&s;ible that I, in this de&s;olate place, can &s;peak to what pa&s;&s;es in my own country, yet, I'll ven|ture to &s;ay, it is in no &s;imilar danger, for the purity of true Engli&s;h blood will al|ways prove an antidote to the poi&s;on of any &s;uch viper.</P>
<P>After my &s;chool hours were over, I had, as I before mentioned, appointed John Hewit to meet me at Mrs. Crow's; and, indeed, my de&s;ign on him was to beg his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my philanthropic plan, which I had no doubt would greatly con|tribute
<PB N="118" REF="138">
to &s;often his manners, and fit him for the purpo&s;es of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As he had told Mrs. Crow, that what he had to &s;ay to me was very material; &s;o, indeed, I found it; for, after a proper preparation, I learnt that my brother had been &s;hipwrecked with him, and very pro|bably drowned, for that none of the crew, as far as his knowledge went, e&s;caped, ex|cept him&s;elf, and Walme&s;ley.</P>
<P>I was extremely &s;hocked at this intel|ligence, as the reader may well &s;uppo&s;e; but as it was never my inclination to make my particular misfortunes an inconve|nience to my friends, I made an effort to recover my&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and begged he would relate all that had hap|pened to him &s;ince he had left Wolver|hampton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. JOHN HEWIT's STORY.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN HEWIT now began to relate his adventures; and as one judges better of a man's feelings by his own language, than by any &s;ub&s;titute for it, I &s;hall here en|deavour to &s;et his &s;tory down in the very words he told it:</P>
<P>"I can only &s;ay," &s;aid John, in an&s;wer to my noticing that he had enough to tell me; "that you have hit it; there is enough, indeed, if it was but of the right &s;ort. When I left Wolverhampton, with the five guineas Binns would force upon me, all's one for that, I may pay him one day
<PB N="120" REF="140">
or other may hap, I &s;teered for Worce&s;ter, being determined to pu&s;h for Bri&s;tol, and to go to &s;ea. Well, the fir&s;t thing that happened was, they took me up for a de|&s;erter, &s;tole my money, and marched me to their head quarters at Birmingham; and there, after keeping me in a dungeon for four days, and bringing me to a court martial, I was ordered, by the name of Robert Grig&s;by, to receive three hundred la&s;hes, as it was my fir&s;t offence; God knows it was an offence I had not com|mitted, but I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I could give but a poor account of my&s;elf, and &s;o I was had out and tied up to the halbert.</P>
<P>"I had received about &s;ixty, or &s;e|venty la&s;hes, when a party came and en|quired what was doing? They were an|&s;wered, 'No great matter, only flogging a de&s;erter, one Robert Grig&s;by.' 'Why, damme, that's impo&s;&s;ible,' &s;aid the other, 'here's Robert Grig&s;by hand&s;omely hand|cuffed; we took him this morning.' 'Oh!
<PB N="121" REF="141">
that's another thing,' &s;aid the &s;erjeant, 'leave off drummer, &s;ome little mi&s;take here, I find.' "So I was untied, and e&s;corted back to the inn.</P>
<P>"The hand bill that adverti&s;ed a re|ward for the apprehen&s;ion of Grig&s;by, cer|tainly de&s;cribed a per&s;on exactly my &s;ize and complexion; but when we came face to face, we were not like at all; but as they had no power to di&s;charge me, with|out their officer, who was gone upon a party of plea&s;ure, with &s;ome milliner's ap|prentices, to &s;ee the Lea&s;owes and Hagley, and other places about the country, I was crammed into the dungeon for two days more, and then brought up for re-exami|nation. The officer, who was the left|handed &s;on of a demi-rep of di&s;tinction by a trooper in the guards, &s;aid it was all owing to my own &s;ulkine&s;s; for if I had given a proper account of my&s;elf, I might have come off well enough;" 'but come,' &s;aid he, 'my lad, you have had a ta&s;te of
<PB N="122" REF="142">
our life, and &s;o what &s;ay you, &s;uppo&s;e you enli&s;t?'</P>
<P>"I told him the ta&s;te I had had would &s;erve me for a meal, and only begged that I might have what belonged to me, and be permitted to go. He a&s;ked me what I meant? I &s;aid they had taken five guineas from me, and &s;ome &s;ilver. They all &s;wore mo&s;t righteou&s;ly that I lied, and &s;aid I mu&s;t be a hardened villain, indeed, to ac|cu&s;e poor harmle&s;s fellows of &s;uch a crime, when they were only doing the King's duty; yes, &s;aid I, and you were doing the King's duty, I &s;uppo&s;e, when you appre|hended me for another. Here the officer interpo&s;ed, who, certainly, had not done his duty in not &s;u&s;pending all proceedings again&s;t me 'till the party had returned, who alone knew Grig&s;by. He &s;aid I might thank my &s;tars I had come off &s;o well; that it was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ecute the mili|tary law with rigour, and that there was not &s;o fine a code of ethics in the world as
<PB N="123" REF="143">
the articles of war;" 'for,' &s;aid he, 'if any one &s;trikes his commanding officer, he &s;hall be inflicted upon with death, or wor&s;e puni&s;hment.'</P>
<P>"That, &s;aid I is what you want to in|flict upon me, for it is wor&s;e than death for a poor innocent fellow to &s;tarve in a dun|geon, and be &s;logged for a crime he is not guilty of, while his friends are wondering what is become of him." 'Ay!' &s;aid he, 'and where now, Mr. Conundrum, are your friends waiting for you?' "I had now got a &s;tory by heart, and &s;aid, at Bri&s;tol." 'Well, that we &s;hall &s;ee,' &s;aid he, 'I &s;hall give you over to the civil power; and if Mr. Ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied that you are <HI>compos,</HI> you may go to your friends whenever you will, &s;o no animo&s;ity my friend, the&s;e little broolies will hap|pen, and it is all fortune <HI>de queer.'</HI></P>
<P>"Queer enough, thought I. So I was had before the Ju&s;tice, as a &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="124" REF="144">
per&s;on, that could not give any account of him&s;elf. They fir&s;t &s;ent me to Bridewell 'till the examining day, where every body that had been robbed, was de&s;ired to at|tend.</P>
<P>"When the day came, I was examined like an hor&s;e at a fair. One &s;aid, 'that if I had been a little &s;horter, he could have almo&s;t &s;worn I was the man that cheated him by dropping a ring one day at market.' Another &s;aid, 'he had a good mind to &s;wear I had &s;tolen his hor&s;e; for though he was fifty miles off at the time, every body told him it was ju&s;t &s;uch another ill looking fellow.' One man &s;aid, 'he could not exactly &s;ay who I was, but he recol|lected, perfectly, that he had often &s;een me with a &s;traw in my &s;hoe, at the a&s;&s;ize hall at Warwick;' and another 'remem|bered, as if it had been but ye&s;terday, that I had been arraigned at the Old Baily by the name of Sligo, alias hard favoured Jack.'</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="145">
"Why all the&s;e people &s;hould be &s;o de&s;irous of my being hanged, who had never done them an injury, I could not imagine; nor, indeed, did I much care. My only fear was that the real murder would come out, and that the wretch, who had committed it, would &s;wear my life away. However, it did not, and I was di&s;charged, after making out a pretty good &s;tory, by &s;aying I was a &s;ailor, and that I belonged to the Brittannia Privateer which the new&s;papers informed me was mu&s;ter|ing her compliment of hands, and on board which &s;hip I knew your brother was fir&s;t lieutenant.</P>
<P>"It was in vain to &s;ay any thing about my money, &s;o I &s;et off without it, and a thought came acro&s;s me, that as it was Stourbitch fair, I might, by holding hor&s;es, or doing any job that was wanted, pick up a few &s;hillings. My only fear was, that in &s;uch a public place, I &s;hould be known; &s;o I put a black patch upon my eye,
<PB N="126" REF="146">
&s;tained my &s;kin with wallnut &s;hells, and cut my hair clo&s;e to my head.</P>
<P>"When I got to the fair, I found them all alive; but the fir&s;t thing I took notice of was a company of players, who were very bu&s;y preparing a booth. As I &s;tood looking on, one of them a&s;ked me, by the name of Blinky, to lend them a hand; and finding I went readily to work, they gave me &s;ome bread and chee&s;e, and &s;ome beer, to encourage me. At la&s;t they found me &s;o u&s;eful, that I was chief cook and pilot with them, and at night, when we were at &s;upper, all of us hey fellow well met, ladies and gentlemen, kings, coblers, and harlequins; they &s;wore I was &s;uch a comical dog, that they would take me in upon a &s;hare. Indeed, with|out vanity, I was as good a one for their purpo&s;e as any in the company, for I could play upon the fiddle, &s;ing a &s;ong, and dance a hornpipe, as you know Mrs. Hannah.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="147">
"When they found this, I was no man to be trifled with. Bu&s;ine&s;s was chalked out for me, and the part of Jack in Di&s;tre&s;s was adverti&s;ed, with a &s;ong and a hornpipe, in character, by a real &s;ailor, who had the misfortune to lo&s;e one of his eyes in the field of battle.</P>
<P>"To have &s;een the &s;hifts we were all put to, and our comical di&s;tre&s;s, while we prepared for action, you would have laughed at, and pitied us; paper handker|chiefs were made for the ladies, the gen|tlemens' legs were chalked to make &s;tock|ings, and gilt leather hilts were tacked to wooden &s;words. But the &s;carce&s;t article was &s;hirts. I &s;hall never forget the di&s;tre&s;s of one of the actors, and how he enjoyed it. He had &s;ent his be&s;t &s;hirt, he had but an|other, to be wa&s;hed, and the wa&s;herwo|man had returned it by her little girl, who &s;aid, 'her mammy could not wa&s;h that &s;hirt, for if &s;he did, it was &s;o rotten, &s;he &s;hould rub it all to pieces,' with all the
<PB N="128" REF="148">
good humour in the world. 'My &s;weet little cherub of the wa&s;h-hou&s;e,' &s;aid he, 'tell that empre&s;s of &s;oap &s;uds, your ma|ma, if &s;he is afraid of rubbing the &s;hirt to pieces, to pin it up again&s;t the wall and throw a pail of water at it.'</P>
<P>"Indeed, for the little time I was with them, I never &s;aw people &s;o mi&s;era|ble, and &s;o merry. At la&s;t the night came when I was to make my appearance. I had got through the &s;ong a &s;econd time, for it was encored, and was in the middle of the hornpipe, when who &s;hould I &s;ee, &s;taring me full in the face, but Joe Taylor, our Bridewell keeper here at Wolver|hampton.</P>
<P>"Convinced he was come with a war|rant to &s;eize me, e&s;pecially as he mu&s;t have known my voice again, I could not make another &s;tep; but &s;huffled, and &s;huffled about, in confu&s;&s;ion, 'till, at la&s;t, I darted behind the &s;cenes, ran out of the
<PB N="129" REF="149">
booth, cleared the fair, and was two miles off before I ventured to look round; nor was I then &s;atisfied that I was out of dan|ger, for nothing could get it out of my head but that I was &s;till pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>"I, neverthele&s;s, went a little &s;lower, and this convinced me my fears were not groundle&s;s, for I not only heard foot&s;teps, but, pre&s;ently, a voice. Li&s;tening, how|ever, with more attention, &s;omebody called out, in a tone that I knew per|fectly well. 'Blinky,' and then, 'what fa&s;ter &s;till? Nay, and thou'lt run, I'll trot as well as thee:' and other &s;peeches from plays, in imitation of different actors, by which I, at la&s;t, found that it was one Charles Walme&s;ley, a mimic, and fearing no danger from him, I halted till he came.</P>
<P>"He informed me that Joe Taylor had not come for me, but for him; that one of the actors had learnt this from the
<PB N="130" REF="150">
man who &s;old beer at the next booth, and had advi&s;ed him to e&s;cape. This happening ju&s;t as I ran out of the booth, he followed me as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, under an idea that I might be making my e&s;cape from the &s;ame per&s;on; for, in my cups, one night, I was fooli&s;h enough to hint that I was afraid of the Phili&s;tines, as they called the officers of ju&s;tice.</P>

A butcher wanted to have him baited. I &s;aid I did not dare bait him, for that at Coventry, where, by the bye, we had never been, he hugged &s;o many dogs to death, that the mayor would not &s;ign my travelling licence, which I pre|tended, though no &s;uch thing can be granted, to have in form, without I gave &s;ecurity never to bait him again; the mayor very ju&s;tly ob&s;erving, that bear dancing was a funny recreative amu&s;e|ment, but bear baiting was cruel and not tolerated by act of parliament. 'And he was right,' &s;aid a lawyer, 'bear baiting, or baiting bears, is exploded, and nulled, and voided, by <HI>anno &s;ecundUS, liber &s;e|cunDO Guliemus &s;ecundUM.</HI>'</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. CONCLUSION OF JOHN HEWIT'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>"WE were now &s;afe out of danger, and, yet, how it happened I don't know, for if the country people had not been a &s;et of &s;tupid louts, we &s;hould have been twenty times found out; though, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, what with the gla&s;s eyes, a fal&s;e tongue upon wires, and a &s;tring that pulled the ears up and down, all which were managed very dexteriou&s;ly, Walme&s;ley made a devili&s;h good bear; and then I took care to keep the people at a di&s;tance, under a notion that he would bite them, I can't help laughing to think how many fools we made.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="167">
"Well, as I &s;aid, being out of danger, we &s;at our&s;elves down to &s;upper, and Wal|me&s;ley told me all his adventures, and from that moment&mdash;but, however, that's no matter; I had better tell you my own &s;tory, and let him, if ever he &s;hould come to make love to you, tell his.</P>
<P>"Well, being come to Bri&s;tol, I &s;oon found out your brother's rendezvous, and Walme&s;ley and Hewet were entered aboard the Brittannia, at the &s;ame time. We went to &s;ea, and though your brother is a dear good &s;oul for encouraging every body, yet poor Hewit was entirely lo&s;t, and Walme&s;ley was all and all. To be &s;ure he did all he could to make him&s;elf beloved, and he &s;ucceeded; and I will &s;ay this, there is &s;omething in your bro|ther &s;o taking, and &s;o noble, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to know him and not fight through fire and water for him; and now I'll let you into a &s;ecret, Mrs Hannah; I had all my life thought that people could not live
<PB N="148" REF="168">
free without being profligates; but your brother convinced me to the contrary; for though he drinks and &s;wears, and loves a pretty girl as well as any fine fellow that ever lived, I don't think there's a bi&s;hop in the kingdom has more good|ne&s;s, no, damme, nor more religion nei|ther."</P>
<P>I &s;miled at this and thought I began to &s;ee that one rake had made a convert of another. What he uttered of my brother I knew to be truth; and, indeed, &s;o does the reader know it. His letter &s;ufficiently proves he was all heart and could di&s;|gui&s;e nothing, but expre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e ideas that were con&s;onant to goodne&s;s and &s;u&s;|ceptibility ju&s;t as they were conceived; and through life this is the faire&s;t criterion of &s;incerity. No man can &s;tudy to be good, it mu&s;t be in his nature; Why then &s;tudy to explain goodne&s;s? Let the ebu|lition take its cour&s;e; and as nothing is &s;o chearful as innocence, let the eyes gli&s;ten
<PB N="149" REF="169">
with plea&s;ure till they are dimmed by &s;en|&s;ibility. A tear, the re&s;ult of a &s;mile, is a tribute to humanity; a &s;mile, the re&s;ult of a tear, is a &s;acrifice to hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>"Well," continued Hewit, "you know mo&s;t of what pa&s;t till after the Vigo bu&s;ine&s;s. Walme&s;ley was &s;oon made an officer, and when your brother commanded the Eagle, he was his fir&s;t lieutenant. To be &s;ure, in the Vigo affair, he did behave well. I &s;tood by and &s;aw that letter he bid the &s;econd lieutenant write to you, and, to &s;ay the truth, twas I that fir&s;t thought of it.</P>
<P>"Now you &s;ee I am going to tell you what pa&s;&s;ed after that time. When we had brought home the Eagle &s;afe to Bri&s;tol, our next care was to &s;ee what could be done for Captain Higgins. The owners did not chu&s;e to have any thing to do with it, for fear of endangering the &s;afety of the &s;hip, for &s;he certainly was very
<PB N="150" REF="170">
fairly captured at Vigo; and though they were truly &s;en&s;ible of your brother's gal|lantry and good conduct, they would not let their money &s;tand idle; &s;o, to make &s;ure of the thing, they fitted her out, gave a lubberly fellow the command of her, and the next news was, that &s;he was taken by a French frigate and carried into Bour|deaux.</P>
<P>"They now did not chu&s;e to know any thing more about your brother than if they had never &s;een him; &s;o that he might rot in a dungeon and welcome, for any thing they cared. A choice &s;et of us went aboard a Portugue&s;e and &s;ailed for Li&s;bon; where, to our great &s;atisfaction, we found your brother &s;afe and &s;ound. Walme&s;ley had left the two Spani&s;h ho&s;tages under the care of the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul, who had given them their parole, fir&s;t pledging his word of honour to Walme&s;ley, that they &s;hould not have their entire liberty till the Governor of Vigo had relea&s;ed Captain
<PB N="151" REF="171">
Higgins; which, upon his repre&s;entation, they did, re&s;erving a right to demand of the owners of the Eagle, the value of the &s;hip. How they will get out of the &s;crape I can't &s;ay; for my part, I hope they will be fairly trounced, if it be only for &s;erving your brother &s;uch a ra&s;cally trick.</P>
<P>"Well, now Mrs. Hannah, there is but little more to tell you, but that little is bad enough. We had no bu&s;ine&s;s to be kicking our heels at Li&s;bon, and &s;o we got aboard a Portugue&s;e to come home; and &s;o making the channel, we were prettily knocked about for four days, and, at la&s;t, &s;tranded upon the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee, &s;he &s;truck upon a &s;and bank, with the tide at ebb; &s;o we did all we could to clear her by the flood; but it would not do, we found &s;he would not float; &s;o, at la&s;t, finding &s;he filled fa&s;t, we took to the boats, with a &s;tiff gale from
<PB N="152" REF="172">
the land, and the devil of a &s;urf. We tugged, and tugged; by and bye, we lo&s;t &s;ight of the other boat, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he &s;unk. You &s;ee, your brother and I happened to be in different boats, I &s;hould have liked to have had a birth with the Captain, even if I had gone down with him, but the&s;e things can't always be as we wi&s;h; &s;o after we had been at this pretty work, I &s;uppo&s;e, two hours, a &s;ud|den &s;quall cap&s;ized the boat.</P>
<P>"It happened that I had a clum&s;y oar in my haud, &s;o I laid it acro&s;s my brea&s;t, and made it &s;erve me for a pair of corks; and by that time I was hand&s;omely tired, I began to find that I could touch ground. This gave me heart, and I trudged lu&s;tily on till I was &s;afely landed. So telling them at the next town that my name was John Hewit, and this was my pari&s;h, they pa&s;&s;ed me here as a vagrant.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="173">
'You are not certain,' &s;aid I, 'that the boat my brother was in &s;unk? "Not certain," &s;aid Hewit, "but I fear it &s;unk. To be &s;ure, as the wind blew &s;o &s;trong off the land, they might have been driven to &s;ea; but that would have been wor&s;e! for how could &s;uch a nut&s;hell live in a rough &s;ea in the channel, where the wind and tide were quarreling like the bubbling of a pot?"</P>
<P>'And what became of walme&s;ley?' &s;aid I, "God knows," &s;aid John, "whe|ther he is alive or dead. Walme&s;ley and Hewit parted when the boat went down. I will, however, &s;ay this of him; that whe|ther dead or alive, Walme&s;ley was a wor|thy fellow; and, however, he may be my rival, I have a great value for him, and &s;o I have often told your brother.</P>
<P>"He has a droll way of doing things, to be &s;ure, but his heart en't the wor&s;e.
<PB N="154" REF="174">
If he tells you he has been guttling and drinking away all his money, and that he had great enjoyment in it, he means that he has done &s;o by the mouths of others; for the eating and drinking, to his mind, is the feeding tho&s;e who want a dinner, and his greate&s;t enjoyment is to relieve a fellow creature in di&s;tre&s;s. If ever you &s;ee him, you'll hear him talk of his <HI>menu plai&s;irs,</HI> and he'll give it a turn, as if it meant youthful irregularity; and faith, in one &s;en&s;e, &s;o it is, for there are very few young men who regularly pity misfortune, or receive plea|&s;ure by giving comfort to the afflicted.</P>
<P>"But come Mrs. Hannah," &s;aid he, whether your brother be &s;aved, or not; "whatever may be gone with Walme&s;ley; I &s;hould be glad if you would con&s;ider me as a friend. I am not the &s;ame John Hewit I was when I left this place; I have &s;marted for my folly; and I mean now to &s;tick to my trade, that I may always have

<P>I was very much penetrated with this hand&s;ome character he had given of his rival, and could not help telling him &s;o. He made a &s;uitable reply, and we parted at Mr. Smallbrook's door, for he &s;aw me home, in very good humour with each other. As, in our way, we were nece&s;&s;arily obliged to pa&s;s through Love-lane, I could not refrain from mentioning the circum&s;tance of Jenny Rhodes, and Su&s;an Wingrove, and all the con&s;equences of that bu&s;ine&s;s; this brought up Sourby, and Binns; the fir&s;t of whom, he &s;aid, "he was now too well convinced was an infa|mous wretch; and the latter he was as willing as I was to think well of;" indeed, he concluded with me, that villainy had

been played off again&s;t him, in which, he &s;aid, "he &s;hould not be &s;urprized, if my brother, the lawyer, had &s;ome concern." In &s;hort, he &s;aid, "he had yet a very long hi&s;tory to tell me, of one &s;ort, or other, but that he &s;hould defer it till we become certain whether my brother was alive, or dead, becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "it would come more properly from his mouth than mine."</P>

He, as well as Walme&s;ley, had done his utmo&s;t to gain my brother's e&s;teem, and yet Walme&s;ley &s;eemed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it all. I very much feared that there were &s;omething to come out, if ever I &s;hould &s;ee my brother, that would not tell much to Hewit's credit. One thing was certain, however, that he now
<PB N="158" REF="178">
&s;eemed heartily contrite, and I yet hoped, even though Walme&s;ley were to return, that I might manage matters &s;o as honour|ably to think of Hewit with my brother's con&s;ent.</P>
<P>As there was a good deal of prize money due to Hewit at Bri&s;tol, his ma&s;|ter and Mr. Smallbrook advi&s;ed him to go there and enquire after it, in which ad|vice I heartily joined them, in hopes it might be the means of learning what was become of my brother.</P>
<P>He had not been gone but two days, when, as I was copying a portrait of him in enamel, which I had taken before he went, a per&s;on enquired for me, who &s;aid his name was Walme&s;ley. I was all in a flutter at this news, when, to my a&s;toni&s;h|ment and &s;atisfaction, he entered and de|livered me a letter from my brother.</P>
<P>Delighted as I was to hear that my bro|ther
<PB N="159" REF="179">
lived, and anxious to read his letter, I could not help eying this Walme&s;ley from head to foot; and, I think, I never conceived &s;o hearty an aver&s;on for any body at fir&s;t &s;ight in my life. He &s;eemed, an in&s;ignificant, whiffling coxcomb; but as I am always ju&s;t, and as I knew that my brother would not have had a predelection for any per&s;on, who was not, in &s;ome de|gree, worthy his partiality, I &s;u&s;pended my judgment; and de&s;iring him to &s;it down, read the letter, which contained what follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>This letter will be handed to you by Charles Walme&s;ley, who will have enough to tell you till I &s;ee you my&s;elf, which, I hope, will be in a day or two, if my crazy timbers will let me proceed, &s;or they have been cur&s;edly &s;hattered by this la&s;t &s;quall. You mu&s;t know we were all &s;tranded on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex; and
<PB N="160" REF="180">
taking to the boat, we were blown out to &s;ea, where, by good luck, we were taken up by a mackeral hoy; I call 'em cats, they'll live any how.</P>
<P>Well, after kicking about pretty merrily for three days, we made the land; and, as I generally find &s;omebody or other I know, I pick up an old &s;hipmate, the commander of a trader, who I &s;aved from going to pri&s;on, by retaking him from the French. He is now a pilot, and I have a notion, a bit of a &s;muggler, but that's no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. He gave us all a hearty welcome, and furni&s;hed me with quintibles enough to make your port, where I &s;hall expect you properly to rig me out, for my wardrobe's gone to Davy Jones's locker. After that, I &s;hall go and call tho&s;e ra&s;cals, at Bri&s;tol, to account; they have u&s;ed me very ill Hannah; but I'll tell you more when I &s;ee you, in the mean time take good care of Walme&s;ley,
<PB N="161" REF="181">
I dare &s;ay you'll like him, he is a droll dog, does a dancing bear to a nicety, &s;o, till I join company, adieu.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate brother, THOMAS HIGGINS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I under&s;tood, from Walme&s;ley, that in his way to me, my brother had been taken ill on the road; but impatient to let me know he was living, he had di&s;patched his friend with this letter. I a&s;ked a thou|&s;and que&s;tions, to which I received very &s;ingular, but not very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. In &s;hort, I found Mr. Walme&s;ley, though a harmle&s;s character, a very conceited, &s;elf-&s;ufficient &s;ort of a gentleman; and though he began to a&s;&s;ume the lover, and availed him&s;elf of my brother's promi&s;es in his favour, I had very little doubt, when we &s;hould all come face to face, but John Hewit's preten&s;ions would ap|pear to have a more &s;olid foundation than Walme&s;ley's.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="182">
In the mean time I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with his excentricities, and plainly &s;aw he was the very man, in a convivial mo|ment, to win my brother; and, as Mr. Smallbrook in&s;i&s;ted on his being in the hou&s;e, I mu&s;t &s;ay we found him a very entertaining companion. He was full of anecdote and plea&s;antry, and an&s;wered fairly to the character that Hewit had given of him.</P>
<P>The next day after Walme&s;ley arrived, I wrote to Hewit, to tell him that my bro|ther was alive, and coming to Wolver|hampton, and, therefore, he had better re|turn and con&s;ult with him on the means of obtaining what was due to him at Bri&s;tol. I al&s;o told him, by way of accelerating his journey, that Mr. Walme&s;ley had brought a letter from my brother, and was at that time &s;oliciting my hand and heart. To this letter I received an an&s;wer, which convinced me he was a good deal picqued.
<PB N="163" REF="183">
However, he &s;aid, he would &s;et out the next day, and had no doubt but he &s;hould give a good account of the gentleman when he arrived; and that, after all, if my brother per&s;i&s;ted on my marrying Walme&s;ley, and I &s;hould con&s;ent, it would be his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ubmit with patience.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation &s;eemed now to be a very critical one. I had a lover who very warmly be&s;ieged me, a brother, who I ex|pected every hour to &s;econd the preten|&s;ions of that lover, which brother I ten|derly loved, and who was trebly welcome from having e&s;caped a mo&s;t dreadful fate, and in the mean time was nearly lo&s;ing, from a point of fal&s;e delicacy, the man who really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my affections, and who truly gave me his.</P>
<P>In two days my brother arrived, and the next day after, arrived Hewit. My plea&s;ure at &s;eeing my brother, will be
<PB N="164" REF="184">
ea&s;ier conceived than expre&s;&s;ed. He in|formed me of all tho&s;e particulars which the reader knows relative to the Vigo bu|&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ome others, to which I was a &s;tranger my&s;elf; and, among the re&s;t, that my brother, the lawyer, and Sourby had been carrying on a nefarious trade, relative to taking up goods and di&s;counting bills; that they lived away in a great &s;tyle in London, kept their chariots, and mixed in the fir&s;t company; and that their plan was, to prevent detection, by &s;acrificing &s;ome innocent per&s;on, on whom, by a train of circum&s;tances, they contrived &s;u&s;picion &s;hould fall to exonerate them&s;elves. He added, that he had gathered all this infor|mation from a clerk of my brother's, who had run away and entered on board a &s;hip, for fear of being indicted for perjury, for you know &s;aid he, the old &s;aying, Hannah, "the &s;ea and the gallows," hey!</P>
<P>At a proper opportunity I came to a
<PB N="165" REF="185">
round explanation with my brother upon the &s;ubject of Walme&s;ley and Hewit. He li&s;tened to me with more attention than I expected; and, at la&s;t, &s;aid, he only wi&s;hed that Walme&s;ley &s;hould have fair play. "Let him," &s;aid he, "hone&s;tly tell his &s;tory, and what his preten&s;ions are to your partiality; and, when he has fini&s;hed, if it &s;hould appear that Hewit has a &s;uperior title, in God's name marry Hewit. Hewit is a good fellow to my knowledge."</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was very willing to put it upon that i&s;&s;ue. Walme&s;ley's preten&s;ions were at be&s;t collateral. A man, who had, in &s;o many ways, been e&s;&s;entially &s;erviceable in my brother's pre&s;ervation, certainly, had every claim upon my gratitude; but he had never &s;een me till within a few days, or I him; and, therefore, love was out of the que&s;tion. He acknowledged the ju&s;tice of my rea&s;oning, but begged I would hear Walme&s;ley out, after which
<PB N="166" REF="186">
he would leave me at full liberty to de|cide as I &s;hould think proper. This, of cour&s;e, I agreed to, and that very day, after dinner, Walme&s;ley began, in form, to relate his life and adventures.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. WALMESLEY's STORY.</HEAD>
<P>"YOU have heard," &s;aid Walme&s;ley, "of one Billy Shake&s;pear, a nice fellow Billy was, and how he &s;aid, &s;ays he, 'All the the world's a &s;tage, and all the men and women in it merely players;' and never was there a truer thing &s;aid.</P>
<P>"Why, now I&mdash;I ought to know &s;omething, for I was born in the dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;uckled in the flies, educated in the lobby, and brought up in the property-room; and yet, Sir, &s;hall the verie&s;t hind,
<PB N="168" REF="188">
the &s;tupide&s;t lout, the dulle&s;t clod, over|top me in my profe&s;&s;ion; there is &s;ome|thing more than natural in this, if philo&s;o|phy could find it out.</P>
<P>"So much for exordium. Now for my hi&s;tory. My father&mdash;methinks I &s;ee my father&mdash;you under&s;tand me, in my mind's eye, for I never &s;aw him any where el&s;e, to my knowledge; but to the pur|po&s;e. My father, that is to &s;ay, my mo|ther's hu&s;band, who, for a debt of her con|tracting, had been confined at the time of my birth, a twelvemonth in the Fleet, where, I am well informed, &s;he never paid him a &s;ingle vi&s;it, was&mdash;I love a long paren|the&s;is&mdash;&s;haver to the hou&s;e. He was a man, for a few ounces of phlebotomy, the extirpation of a &s;tump, the frothing of a lather, or the fancy of a caxen&mdash;I &s;hall not look upon his like again.</P>
<P>"So much for my reputed father; who my real father was, I could never
<PB N="169" REF="189">
trace. As I was cradled in the thunder trunk, I have been &s;ometimes tempted, in imitation of Alexander, to believe I &s;prung from Jupiter; but, being more be|hind the &s;cences than Alexander was, and knowing better than he did, that gods, godde&s;&s;es, and heroes, are not only meer, but queer mortals when they are undre&s;&s;ed, I corrected my towering hopes, and con|tented my&s;elf with reducing the matter to the mo&s;t probable conjecture I could form; which was, that the contention lay between Mercury, Bajazet, Caliban, and a &s;cene &s;hifter.</P>
<P>"But this &s;ecret, like many others, relative to the origin of great men, wo|men, and children, mu&s;t re&s;t for ever in oblivion. Whether my mother ever in|tended to di&s;cover it, or whether &s;he could have di&s;covered it, if &s;he had intended it, I cannot &s;ay; the my&s;tery certainly never came out; for having taken a fancy to wire dancing, and embarked for Ireland,
<PB N="170" REF="190">
in company with the notorious Maddox, and the no le&s;s notorious The Cibber; &s;he was &s;ent to tell the fi&s;hes that I was the queen's &s;on Cloten.</P>
<P>"Little Walme&s;ley, however, finding me apt, brought me up, and treated me as much like a &s;on as if I had been ever &s;o hone&s;t madam's i&s;&s;ue, nor did I ill repay his tender care; for I &s;oon went on in proce&s;&s;ions, held up trains, per&s;onated de|vils and cupids; and, at length, arrived at the envied di&s;tinction of repre&s;enting the little Duke of York, and being &s;mothered in the Tower.</P>
<P>"Were I all my tale to unfold, even from my boyi&s;h days to the very moment you bid me tell it, you would hear of nothing but battles, breaches, and hair breadth e&s;capes; but the battles would be with foils, the breaches would be of arti|cles, and the hair breadth e&s;capes would be from the bailiffs. All this to hear,
<PB N="171" REF="191">
would you, my dear Mi&s;s Hewit, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly incline, you would love me for the dangers I had pa&s;t, and I &s;hould love you that you did pity them.</P>
<P>"Therefore as brevity is the &s;oul of wit, and tediou&s;ne&s;s its outward limbs, and flouri&s;hes, I will be brief. I was &s;oon noticed in the threatre; nay, not to &s;peak it profanely, I was a bit of a &s;avourite in every part of the hou&s;e. I would let puns in the green-room, drink crank in the mu&s;ic-room, or hold a candle in the dre&s;&s;ing-room, with any body of my in|ches on the boards.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;hining qualities &s;oon brought me into great repute with the twenty-&s;hil|ling actors; who were obliged, like other &s;ubalterns, to live like gentlemen, after deducting three-fourths of their pay to find them&s;elves in &s;tage nece&s;&s;aries. There was, however, a collateral con&s;ideration in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Five &s;hillings in full weeks,
<PB N="172" REF="192" MS="y">
and three and &s;ixpence in Lent, not being an appointment &s;ufficiently &s;plendid to keep up heroic dignity; they were now and then under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to little Walme&s;ley; who having an infi|nity of bu&s;ine&s;s in the caxen way, and be|&s;ides, having al&s;o, ju&s;t before my mo|ther's departure, compounded a <HI>crim. con.</HI> affair with a celebrated actor, who was afraid of his wife, though &s;he, by the way, had about nine gallants, the rogue had be|come a little Crae&s;us.</P>
<P>"To him, therefore, they had re|cource; and he, on the moderate terms of a crown in the pound, would advance, perhaps, a few pieces for a month; to which the rogues would &s;eriou&s;ly incline and think there was much kindne&s;s in the Jew.</P>
<P>"It &s;ometimes, however, happened, for lack of means, owing to the importu|nity of &s;ome wa&s;herwoman, the rapacity of &s;ome hu&s;&s;ey, or the brutality of &s;ome
<PB N="173" REF="193">
landlord, they were not quite &s;o punctual in their payments as they ought to have been. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions they never failed to entreat my good offices, which were not always admini&s;tered without ef|fect; that is to &s;ay, upon the advance of the premium. Many a re&s;pite from cap|tivity, have I obtained for caged Bajazets, and dugeoned Lu&s;ignans; Sam&s;ons have been &s;aved from the Phili&s;tines by my eloquence; nay, like another The&s;eus, have I re&s;cued virgins from the devour|ing jaws of that minotaur, a bailiff.</P>
<P>"I became now of great u&s;e to little Walme&s;ley. I had reading and writing, which, as Dogberry &s;ays, come by nature, at my fingers' ends; whereas, the Ton&s;or could only make his mark. This being &s;o, as &s;o it &s;eems to be, he kept his ac|counts, rather lamely, indeed, in no other way than by marking with a piece of chalk on the in&s;ide of an old &s;crutoire, exactly
<PB N="174" REF="194">
in the manner of a &s;core at an ale-hou&s;e, the different monies he had advanced to the actors. Thus frequent mi&s;takes hap|pened, to which I gave a helping hand by, now and then, when he was drunk, and had left his bureau open, rubbing out a round O with a cro&s;s, which &s;ignified half a crown, and putting the half crown in my pocket for my own proper &s;pending.</P>
<P>"If two men ride upon a hor&s;e, one mu&s;t ride behind. The little latherer thinking no more than the man that was going to be hanged, did of his dying day, of the tricks I had played him; which, by the bye, I con&s;idered as a fair reim|bur&s;ement of that money I had earned in my profe&s;&s;ion, after repeated trials of my hone&s;ty, &s;uch as leaving &s;ix penny worth of halfpence upon the chimney piece, which I mu&s;t have been a great fool to have touched, well knowing why it was placed there; he began to let me into all
<PB N="175" REF="195">
his u&s;urious my&s;teries; and, but that I was forbid to tell the &s;ecrets of my pri&s;on-hou&s;e, I could a tale unfold&mdash;</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, you will be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that this muck-worm, be&s;ides notes, bonds, undertakings, and cognovits, had ama&s;&s;ed together, partly in money, and partly in valuables, eleven hundred pounds. Nay, if I tell you a lie, &s;pit in my face, and call me a hor&s;e, I &s;ay eleven hundred pounds; and then there was &s;carcely a de|po&s;it that did not tell &s;ome curious hi&s;tory. Here lay a diamond hoop, that &s;ome old enamorato had &s;tolen from the finger of his cara &s;po&s;a, as &s;he lay a&s;leep, to pur|cha&s;e the virtue of a theatrical ve&s;tal, who had three hu&s;bands alive and merry. There a pair of pa&s;te buckles, which &s;ome old love &s;tricken devotee had purcha&s;ed with her hu&s;band's ca&s;h, in her way from the Tabernacle, to win an hour's dalliance with her angel of an actor, who had ju&s;t been per&s;onating a devil; nay, there
<PB N="176" REF="196">
were more of the&s;e things than I have thoughts to give them &s;cope, or time to tell them in.</P>
<P>"But the mo&s;t curious hi&s;tory that came to our knowledge was this; One of the bona robas, who&s;e hu&s;band winked at her intrigues, had a very elegant &s;et of jewels given her by a nobleman. She had be&s;ides, an affair of galantry with a figure dancer, and it was known that &s;he lavi&s;hed large &s;ums of money on him, which &s;he had received from the &s;ame quarter. Not that &s;he was ungrateful to her hu&s;band, for he, now and then, &s;hared her genero&s;ity too.</P>
<P>"After a time, the hu&s;band being in want of ca&s;h, for money's a good &s;oldier and will on, he took an opportunity, when &s;he was theatrically indi&s;po&s;ed, and could not &s;port her jewels, of carrying them to a jeweller. His reque&s;t was that the jewels might be imitated, for he that is robbed,
<PB N="177" REF="197">
not knowing what is &s;tolen, let him not know it, he is not robbed at all, told the jeweller, that over and above the expence, he would make him a liberal amends.</P>
<P>"The jeweller being an hone&s;t man, ay hone&s;t! for, to be hone&s;t as the world goes! begged to be excu&s;ed. In &s;hort, it came out that the jewels had been imitated at the de&s;ire of the wife, that the figure dancer had received the major part of the money, and that the real diamonds had been repurcha&s;ed by a man of fa&s;hion, and given as a <HI>tour de gallantrie,</HI> to the lady of the nobleman who had originally given them to the actre&s;s.</P>
<P>"But were I as tedious as a prince, I could wa&s;te it all upon your wor&s;hip. Well, my papa, the barber, and I &s;haved the people pretty clo&s;e. There was one thing, to be &s;ure, I could not bear. It was almo&s;t always our practice to &s;end in a bill and a bailiff. Now, really, that hurt
<PB N="178" REF="198">
me. To &s;ee a hero, or a devil, or a gho&s;t, after he had &s;trutted, and fretted his hour upon the &s;tage, and had &s;tuck his fork into a &s;moaking mutton chop, at the Blue-po&s;ts, torne away in &s;ight of Heaven, Oh it was pityful! 'twas wonderous pityful!</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, it was &s;o pityful, that I expo&s;tulated with old Shylock;-and, when he an&s;wered me with &s;ome &s;anctified &s;peech, told him that the devil could quote &s;crip|ture for his purpo&s;e. What do you think happened? He gave me &s;ome little civil hint about kicking me out of the hou&s;e, a &s;ort of a &s;piritual &s;hove; and becau&s;e I had made free, now and then, with our common &s;tock, for no other purpo&s;e in the world, than for the innocent amu&s;e|ment of keeping a girl and a gig, he talked of robbery and &s;ending to Newgate.</P>
<P>"I determined, from that moment, to be up with him; but, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, re|member Hermolaus and be hu&s;hed. Fal&s;e
<PB N="179" REF="199">
face mu&s;t hide what the foul heart doth know. I promi&s;ed to mend my manners, and try, if po&s;&s;ible, to be as great a ra&s;cal as him&s;elf. In the mean time, I was like a mole working under ground; I tampered with my con&s;pirators, met them over a jorum of the righteous, at the very witching time of night; and, when I found them ripe for revolt, I told them that I wore a dagger, and I could wi&s;h it&mdash;</P>
<P>"They under&s;tood me in a moment, and &s;wore to live and die with Bedamer. To de&s;cend from my &s;tilts.&mdash;To three of tho&s;e actors who had been very much fleeced; neat fellows, lads of &s;punk, though they had arrived no farther in their profe&s;&s;ion than, 'Sir, the coach waits;' or, 'Ma'am your muff and tippet &s;tops the way,' Did I broch my intention. I ad|vi&s;ed them to bring actions again&s;t Wal|me&s;ley for u&s;ury, in which ca&s;e they would, each of them, recover three times the money that had been advanced. They
<PB N="180" REF="200">
were tickled with the propo&s;al, and pro|mi&s;ed to fulfil the conditions, which were the&s;e:</P>
<P>"As they could never recover, with|out my helping hand, and as I mu&s;t give up the little razor &s;tropper, if I lent them a helping hand, I in&s;i&s;ted upon a po&s;itive agreement, that my name &s;hould not be mentioned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, till I &s;hould give permi&s;&s;ion; and that whatever money might be recovered, &s;hould be ve&s;ted in my hands, for the purpo&s;e of taking a town, and opening a country theatre, of which theatre I &s;hould be &s;ole and ex|clu&s;ive manager. Oh glorious thought! By Heaven I will indulge it, though but in fancy!</P>
<P>"Mortified as they were at their ill treatment in town, where, they &s;aid, &s;uch fellows as Garrick and Barry, ran away with all the applau&s;e, they looked for|ward with delight to the time when we

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. CONTINUATION OF WALMESLEY'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>"THEY &s;wore to obey me in every thing, and we &s;et our engines to work. The ac|tions were commenced, and as the no&s;e tweaker had advanced, at different times, twenty-&s;even pounds to one, thirty-three to another, and fifty to the third, the gro&s;s &s;um of three hundred and thirty pounds, was expected to come into the common &s;tock.</P>
<P>"He laughed at all this, and told me, not &s;u&s;pecting I was in the &s;ecret, that he would threaten to do 'em up with the ma|nager;
<PB N="183" REF="203">
and as to ma&s;ter Wiggins, the pet|tifogging attorney, who had brought the actions, he'd &s;care him with the gho&s;t of his la&s;t perjury, 'be&s;ides,' &s;aid he, Char|ley, nothing can be done without thee in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and it would be hard, indeed, if father and &s;on could not be true to each other.' So &s;aying, he put five guineas into my hand, I an&s;wered, I &s;hould in all my be&s;t obey him, and he rejoined, that it was a loving and fair reply.</P>
<P>"In the mean time Term came on, and matters had gone as far as a notice of trial. The actors had counteracted every one of his precautions, which he looked upon as the cunning of old Wiggins, who knew all his practices, and how to guard again&s;t them; whereas, had I not prompted my actors, old Wiggins would have thrown them upon their backs, for he had inwardly chuckled at being em|ployed, expecting, in the end, to &s;erve
<PB N="184" REF="204">
his friend Walme&s;ley, with whom he had had a quarrel.</P>
<P>"Wiggins neither expected the actors would have been equal to the in&s;tructions they had given him, nor did Walme&s;ley think Wiggins would have acted &s;o vindic|tively, if there had not been &s;ome colla|teral rea&s;on. In &s;hort, the&s;e two worthy gentlemen, knew &s;o much of each others' tricks, that they were mutually afraid of coming into court; and, therefore, were both determined to have a private inter|view, which was very ea&s;ily effected, for though they had not &s;poke together for &s;everal months, they often met at &s;ome alehou&s;e, or other, near Clifford's, or Ser|jeant's Inn, where the Jew, my father, often went, either to &s;wear to a debt, or to attend as a hired bail.</P>
<P>"Upon comparing notes they began to &s;u&s;pect me, but this con&s;equence I fore|&s;aw,
<PB N="185" REF="205">
and was prepared for it, or any other that might follow. They might fret me, but they could not play upon me. The old hair-roa&s;ter gave me to under&s;tand, by a &s;trange alteration in his manner, what was going forward in his mind. After a great deal of humming, and haing, he a&s;ked, 'if matters &s;hould come to a trial, what &s;ort of evidence I &s;hould give?'</P>
<P>"I an&s;wered the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Why, what the devil, &s;aid I, would you have me lay perjury to my &s;oul! No; not for Venice. In &s;hort, &s;aid I, if you a&s;k me what I think of the matter, you are damned all of one &s;ide like an ill roa&s;ted egg.</P>
<P>'Well, well; but,' &s;aid he, 'you know the&s;e young fellows; don't you think that matters can be accommodated?' Accom|modated, &s;aid I, why ay, that's a good word. It comes from <HI>accomodo;</HI> accom|modated
<PB N="186" REF="206">
is a good word; it is as much as to &s;ay, that when a man is accommodated, he is&mdash;accommodated.</P>
<P>'Pooh, pooh, non&s;en&s;e,' &s;aid old pinching irons, 'will you &s;erve me in it?' To &s;erve my&s;elf, good cou&s;in; for, look you, when you have &s;ettled it, I'll claim of you that bracelet, the rings and other of tho&s;e moveables of which our good cou&s;ins, the cozened actre&s;&s;es, once &s;tood po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t, we came to a right under|&s;tanding, and I was to have fifty pounds, if I could &s;ettle the matter at any price, &s;hort of bringing it into court. My award, as arbitrator, was, that ma&s;ter bar|ber &s;hould refund the original &s;ums, allow three months intere&s;t upon them, and pay all co&s;ts; which terms, with great reluct|ance, were fulfilled; after this I told old pull-tail, that he was queered, bam|boozled,
<PB N="187" REF="207">
and jockeyed, for that I was go|ing with lads fit to &s;eize the world, and rule it when 'twas wilde&s;t.</P>
<P>"Being let into the &s;ecret, nothing could exceed his fury. He &s;aw into the whole plan, and &s;wore he would indite us for a con&s;piracy. I laughed at his folly, and whi&s;pered two or three things in his ear that brought him into better temper. He could not &s;o far rule him&s;elf, how|ever, but that he &s;wore I &s;hould &s;tarve. Hang, &s;aid I, &s;tarve or drown, 'twill be in a better cau&s;e. At la&s;t, I told him to make him&s;elf ea&s;y as to me; and for him, when the trade of u&s;ury failed, if he be|haved him&s;elf well, I would make him barber to the company.</P>
<P>"Now were our brows bound with vic|torious wreaths. The new&s;papers teemed with adverti&s;ements for young actors, and actre&s;&s;es, the manager to be &s;een at the Black Lyon; valet de chambres, and
<PB N="188" REF="208">
ladies' maids, were applied to for cloaths to furni&s;h our wardrobe; I coaxed away the colour-grinder to the hou&s;e, who had taken umbrage, becau&s;e the manager would not permit him to invent and exe|cute a pantomime with his own hands; got hold of a devili&s;h good tumbler, a fine fellow, a little too bold, had like to have broken his neck once, by attempting to imitate the Fall of Niagara; got the co|pies of all the new pieces, by bribing the un|der-prompter; and now, being every way &s;tocked with materials, money, and merit; we da&s;hed off and took the town of Stock-bridge, in Hamp&s;hire; where, by beat of drum, we proclaimed the play of The Su&s;picious Hu&s;band.</P>
<Q>The part of Ranger by<LB>MR. WALMESLEY.<LB>With the Country Dance after the manner of<LB>MR. GARRICK.<LB></Q>
<P>"Stockbridge was a horrid place; and if it had not been for the officers of two troops of dragoons, who treated the far|mers'
<PB N="189" REF="209">
daughters, and invited us, to mum a little, at their public treats, we &s;hould have made a queer thing of it; but what was this to lads of fire like us? Did not the millener's 'prentice, the pretty landlady at the Ro&s;e, and the daughter of farmer Fu&s;&s;ocks, call me the gallant, gay Lo|thario? In &s;hort, though we left Stock-bridge about fifty pounds poorer than we had come into it, 'twas &s;o much plea&s;ure for &s;o much money, care killed a cat, up tail's all, and a fig for the hangman, and &s;o we laughed it off.</P>
<P>"After this; Oh! we had &s;uch march|ings, and counter marchings, from Rum|&s;ey to Alton, from Alton to Reading, from Reading to Hungerford, from Hun|gerford to Land&s;down fair; drums beat|ing, trumpets braying, but the cur&s;e of it was, we got poorer and poorer; I did pity an unfortunate Frenchman, who we took as a dancer at Reading.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="210">
"The Frenchman was to have a &s;hare and a benefit. I explained to him that the &s;hare would be no great matter; it might be three and &s;ixpence, or, perhaps, only fourpence, and three pieces of can|dle; but that the benefit&mdash;'Ah dat is very well, &s;aid Mon&s;ieur, 'mon benefice! dat is good to have benefice.'</P>
<P>"When the benefit night came, the receipt of the hou&s;e turned out to be &s;ix pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings. Next morn|ing the Frenchman called upon me to receive the profits of his benefit; I'll &s;ettle it with you directly, Sir, &s;aid I. The expence of the hou&s;e is eight pounds, and the receipt of the hou&s;e, la&s;t night, was &s;ix pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings; &s;o that, if you will pay me one pound, three &s;hillings, the bu&s;ine&s;s will be &s;ettled. 'Settle! &s;ettle de devil; you mu&s;t pay me my benefice!' Benefit, why don't I tell you that you mu&s;t pay me one pound
<PB N="191" REF="211">
three &s;hillings! 'Pay you? Cot tam, vere it is then my benefice?' Good God, &s;aid I, you don't under&s;tand. 'I under&s;tand extremely well&mdash;you make your charge a eight pone, you make come &s;ix pone, &s;e|venteen &s;hellang i de ho&s;&s;e, &s;o I mo&s;t pay vom pone e tre &s;hellang. Fell den, code &s;one, vere is my benefice?</P>
<P>"It was in vain that I attempted to convince him, by numberle&s;s examples, that nothing was &s;o common as for per|formers to lo&s;e money at their benefits. He could not reconcile &s;uch a contra|diction as that a benefit might be a lo&s;s, and all I could get from him was, 'Sare, you are not hone&s;t man, you promi&s;e benefice, I beg you tell me <HI>ou e&s;t que mon benefice.</HI>'</P>
<P>"After a good deal of altercation, as I did not like to part with him, I told him he &s;hould make his own terms, when
<PB N="192" REF="212">
he &s;aid, 'that &s;ince benefice, was <HI>mala|fice,</HI> he would have two chare, and no be|nefice.' I told him he might be caught at that, and &s;o it turned out, for, at the next town, we &s;hared nothing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. CONCLUSION OF WALMESLEY'S STORY.</HEAD>
<P>"THUS we actors live," continued Wal|me&s;ley, "we live! Zounds, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to tell how we live. One cur&s;ed circum|&s;tance was, that we were always lighting the candle at both ends; always &s;pending as much again as we got; &s;o that, upon a fair calculation, the more we gained the wor&s;e we were off. Why, Sir, in le&s;s than a twelvemonth there was not a devil of us but was in debt in five different towns; but &s;till we were as jovial as beggars upon &s;traw; for, except a black eye or &s;o, in con&s;equence of a quarrel about &s;ome
<PB N="194" REF="214">
dulcinea, who was con&s;tant to us all round, I mu&s;t do the company the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, there never was a &s;et of more amiable officers.</P>
<P>"But the fun we took mo&s;t delight in was, what we call bamming; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, this was my peculiar forte. Whenever we took a town, we were &s;ure to find &s;ome green-horn, or other, whom we pre&s;ently infected with the &s;pouting mania. The&s;e &s;oft &s;irs we u&s;ed to teach a &s;ong, or a &s;peech; till they have &s;o ranted, and &s;o bellowed, that you would have thought nature's journey|men had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity &s;o abomi|nably.</P>
<P>"I made one excellent benefit at Nottingham, and another at Birmingham, by manoeuvres of this kind. At Notting|ham I got hold of the mayor's &s;on, a pre|cious lank haired bit of a noodle; I told
<PB N="195" REF="215">
him he was the young youth in the world to repre&s;ent great per&s;onages; for, &s;aid I, &s;ome are born great, &s;ome atchieve great|ne&s;s, and others have greatne&s;s thru&s;t upon 'em. Icod, Sir, he invited me to drink tea with his mamma. This did the bu&s;ine&s;s. I talked, Oh gods! how I did talk! The mayor was quelling a riot among the &s;tocking weavers, &s;o, you &s;ee, the mamma being, at home, not only the mare but the grey mare, it was agreed that Mrs. Mayore&s;s &s;hould be&s;peak King Richard the Third, and that little Zackery &s;hould perform the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>"To clinch the bu&s;ine&s;s, the mayor|e&s;s invited all Nottingham, except the la|dies in check aprons, to a hop, and circu|lated my tickets round the room. I had a glorious hou&s;e, performed Richard my|&s;elf, every thing went off nobly, the young Prince was applauded to the very echo that did applaud again; for, though he had a gait like a dab chick, a voice
<PB N="196" REF="216">
like an ungrea&s;ed wheel, and a dialect as querulous as three hammers upon an an|vil, yet every one there, being &s;ubject to the &s;ame infirmities, like the hunched backed man, who thought the camel the mo&s;t beautiful object in exi&s;tence, found out a fre&s;h perfection in every &s;peech he uttered; and thus he never came out with 'Niow you my Loord,' or the like; but we were &s;tunned with the applau&s;e.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t give you one in&s;tance. In the &s;cene where the young Prince is &s;hocked at the idea of being lodged at the Tower, Tre&s;&s;el &s;ays, 'I hope all will be well;' this was my hero's an&s;wer, 'I do whuope zo too, but coom to the Tiower, zin it mun be zo.'</P>
<P>"Shall I tell you the Birmingham bu&s;ine&s;s? Come I &s;ee you wi&s;h to know it. My flat there was a fine thick headed black&s;mith, with lungs like a Stentor. I taught him the Early Horn, and made him
<PB N="197" REF="217">
&s;ing it &s;o loud, that one day he broke a pane of gla&s;s in the tap-room we fre|quented, with his cadence. At la&s;t I coaxed him to &s;ing it for my benefit; de|vili&s;h warm fellow, put off, by agree|ment, three hundred tickets.</P>
<P>"When he came on the &s;tage, before the band &s;truck up, he had a mind to pitch his voice, &s;o he began, 'Ti, too, tum, taw!' 'Damn your ti, too, tum, taw,' cried a man in the gallery. My friend eying the fellow with ineffable di&s;dain, cried out, 'Why then damn you! Damn me if I &s;ing any more.' So off he went, and this was all the audience heard of him or the Early Horn.</P>
<P>"But I &s;hould have told ye, that long before this I had cea&s;ed to be a manager, occa&s;ioned, Sir, by jealou&s;y, that green eyed mon&s;ter. To be &s;ure I did keep all the good parts to my&s;elf; but what is
<PB N="198" REF="218">
there that a manager will not attempt? They told me, one day, that as our agree|ment was when we found it a lo&s;ing game, to cut, and part the property; &s;o it was now high time to take that &s;tep while there was any property to part.</P>
<P>"I expo&s;tulated, threatened, and en|treated, to no purpo&s;e, my authority was all gone, Othello's occupation was no more. They &s;aid it was every one now for him&s;elf, and God for us all. That they had worked long enough for me, I might now work for my&s;elf. In &s;hort, I &s;aw it was all over with me. I knew well enough their power. I certainly had an idle, thoughtle&s;s way of involving the concern, by way of &s;ecurity, whenever they would &s;upply me with a little loo&s;e ca&s;h for my <HI>menu plai&s;irs,</HI> and thus I had mortgaged over one day, perhaps, a thun|der trunk, and a &s;hower of rain; another, half a dozen ermine coronation robes,
<PB N="199" REF="219">
made out of &s;lannel, or el&s;e a collection of wor&s;ted wigs; till, in fact, the &s;tock was virtually their own.</P>
<P>"But never count the terms; once and a million. All my rethoric was thrown away. I might as well have bid the lamb preach to the pityle&s;s wolf! They conti|nued firm to their purpo&s;e; and, finding me determined not to abdicate my throne, beckoned to a gentleman, &s;tanding hard by, who, touching me on the &s;houlder, informed me I was his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>"Is it even &s;o? Said I; then I defy you &s;tars! Sir, &s;aid I to the bailiff, you &s;hould be a gentleman; keep off the rab|ble, that I may entertain my fate with de|cency. 'Will you,' &s;aid one, 'a&s;k favour of the Senate?' Cur&s;ed be your Senate! &s;aid I, that Jemmy Twitcher &s;hould peach me, I own, &s;urprizes me; but 'tis a plain proof that the world is all alike, and that
<PB N="200" REF="220">
even our gang can no more tru&s;t one an|other than other people.</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;aid I, take example by this ye managers. Let not the li&s;p, the &s;mile, nor the ru&s;tlings of &s;ilks betray your poor heart to women; let not your trea&s;urers accept drafts for you; your wardrobe-keeper run you up with the trade&s;men; borrow not your performers' money, nor mortgage your property above four times over; le&s;t your men grow in&s;olent, your women indi&s;po&s;ed, le&s;t, in&s;tead of your managing the company, the company &s;hould manage you; and in the fury of your remor&s;e, you take away what was not yours to give&mdash;'Have you done,' &s;aid one; 'Nay,' &s;aid another, 'if you have not, to it again, we'll wait your lei&s;ure.'</P>
<P>"My pretty geniu&s;es fini&s;hed, by telling me that they had agreed to &s;ell my quondam property, now made over to
<PB N="201" REF="221">
them, to the notorious Mr. Linnet, who was in treaty with the mayor of Win|che&s;ter, for that ancient and learned city. That he had promi&s;ed to engage them all on hand&s;ome &s;hares, and would include me, provided I were inclined to embark in the &s;cheme; but that I mu&s;t not expect to perform capital parts, as they had Gibbs, Gawdry, and other actors of that de&s;crip|tion in the company.</P>
<P>"Cromwell, &s;aid I to little Dick Douce, a mon&s;trous good fellow, you re|member him, Hewit, at Stourbitch, I did not think, in all my mi&s;eries, to have &s;hed a tear! but lead me in, take an inventory of all I have to the la&s;t penny, it is the company's.</P>
<P>"To make &s;hort of my &s;tory; after the accounts had been drawn out, and the expences fairly paid, I found my&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gro&s;s &s;um of &s;even pounds, five &s;hillings and fourpence, half|penny,
<PB N="202" REF="222">
one coat, two &s;hirts, a pair of &s;tock|ings, and &s;even wigs. At &s;uch a time to &s;hut me out! I did regret parting from poor Douce. I a&s;ked him to corre&s;pond with me; 'I can't,' &s;aid he; How dye mean can't? You can write letters; 'I don't think I can,' &s;aid the poor fellow, 'I have written nothing but orders and promi&s;ory notes for the&s;e fifteen years.'</P>
<P>"The next freak I took into my head was to be in love. I got an engagement at Stilton, and was fortunate enough to play the principals; Romeo, Old Philpot, and the like. A great brewer's daughter &s;ent me a billet doux; attended the ap|pointment; &s;aw her at the window la|menting her hard fortune to the hard ap|ples and pears in the orchard; &s;ettled the plan of elopement; &s;wore to her beauty, Helen and Hero were but hildings and harlots. Got one of her father's dray hor&s;es; this, Roan, &s;aid I, &s;hall be my throne! mounted the chay cart; bear

<P>"Shall I go on, or have I &s;aid enough? After we had got about three miles in two hours and a half, &s;pouting Romeo and Juliet all the way, like two intriguing ducks in a mill-pond, I heard the tread of hor&s;emen; and, pre&s;ently, re|ceived, my beaver being up, a blow over the pericranium that felled me to the earth. Oh, &s;aid I, thou cutte&s;t my head off with a golden ax, and &s;mile&s;t upon the &s;troke that murders me!</P>
<P>'Ah dom thee!' &s;aid the old father, for it was him and his myrmidons, 'I'll murder thee with the devil to thee.' Thus we went on. I'll read you the &s;cene.</P>

<P>I thank you, &s;aid I, for your affection, though I could have &s;pared you the trouble of a trial that has intruded on me many di&s;agreeable moments; but any thing to convince my brother, that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hall never prove unworthy of him; and now pray, clear as Mr. Walme&s;ley has made this hi&s;tory, I &s;hould be glad to have it a little better elucidated.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="231">
'The bu&s;ine&s;s,' &s;aid my brother, 'is no more than this: Hewit and Walme&s;ley finding, or rather fancying, them&s;elves in danger of being pur&s;ued, agreed to a&s;&s;ume each other's name; &s;o that from the mo|ment they parted, Hewit became Wal|me&s;ley, and Walme&s;ley Hewit; and the trick was this: If Hewit &s;hould be caught by the name of Walme&s;ley, he might ea&s;ily prove he was not the man, and &s;o of the other.'</P>
<P>What then, &s;aid I to Walme&s;ley, you did not go to &s;ea? 'Oh yes, I did,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley, 'can none remember? Yes, I know all mu&s;t&mdash;<Q><L>"When glory, like a dazzling eagle, &s;tood</L>
<L>"Perched on my beaver in the grannic flood."</L></Q></P>
<P>Why, ma'am, as we were riding in latitude ninety-two, gallopping away upon the back of the I&s;le of Wight, ju&s;t as the mizen peak was furled to the cat head, your brother, amid-&s;hips, running out a
<PB N="212" REF="232">
flying jib-boom, and I &s;tanding abaft the taffarel&mdash;</P>
<P>'I wi&s;h you had been with us,' &s;aid my brother, 'with all my &s;oul, we &s;hould have had ten times more fun than we had; but the fact is, having taken a liking to John Hewit, who I entered aboard by the name of Walme&s;ley; he generou&s;ly told me every particular of his love for you, and &s;aid, he had certainly rendered him&s;elf very unworthy of you; but that it &s;hould be his &s;tudy, in future, to merit your good opinion.</P>
<P>'This added to the &s;ervice he did me, for you know, Hannah, I love a gallant fellow, induced me to promote him; but &s;till continued him under the name of Walme&s;ley, both to try your heart, and to avoid any unplea&s;ant explanation with the &s;hip's company.'</P>
<P>And pray, &s;aid I to Hewit, was your
<PB N="213" REF="233">
arm in a &s;ling, Mr. Walme&s;ley, by rea&s;on of a wound you received under the Fort of Vigo, when you &s;ent that letter? 'It certainly was,' &s;aid John, 'but if it had not, I &s;hould have got &s;omebody el&s;e to have written that expre&s;s; for, other|wi&s;e, you would have known my hand writing.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid I, I certainly have been very completely deceived; but there is one thing more: What became of the real Mr. Walme&s;ley, under the fal&s;e name of Hewit, ever &s;ince the bear-baiting bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and how came he to bring that letter, and where did you find him? I am an|xious to know all this; for now I have no fear of him as a lover, I am extremely plea&s;ed with him as an acquaintance.</P>
<P>'Why,' &s;aid my brother, 'as I was journeying on to find you here, devili&s;h ill to be &s;ure I was; and among the re&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="234">
of my plagues, I had, as Shake&s;pear calls it, a raging tooth; this was at Saxmund|ham, and a&s;king the landlord whether they had in the neighbourhood an opera|tor that could un&s;hip it without carrying away any of my upper works, he told me there was one Doctor Hewit in the town, who performed miracles in that way. That he did eyes, cataracts, palates, and hair lips, cut corns, gave &s;hocks, fu|migated, and &s;omentated; that he was the &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on, that there was not &s;uch a dab, within a hundred miles, at a bur&s;ten-child, or a hollow tooth; and that his Turlington, and Daffey, had done wonders; but then, added the landlord, he is mighty &s;oft in other re&s;pects; all he gets, the fooli&s;h man gives away to the poor.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with the name, and &s;till more with the character, on which, though he has &s;aid nothing of it, Hewit u&s;ed very
<PB N="215" REF="235">
much to enlarge. I recollected, that when he &s;eparated from Hewit, he determined to &s;et up in this way, in con&s;equence of having been &s;upplied with proper in&s;truc|tions by the Quack Doctor, to whom he was Merry Andrew at Wellingborough. Nothing, therefore, could get it out of my head but that it was Walme&s;ley him&s;elf. I begged he might be &s;ent for. Lord we knew one another in two minutes, like a couple of free-ma&s;ons. The word, &s;aid I, 'Sweet Marjorum,' &s;aid the Doctor, 'Pa&s;s,' an&s;wered I. 'Why now, upon my &s;oul,' &s;aid he, 'that is very extraordinary, there never was but one man in the world that I &s;ettled that with.' I know it, &s;aid I, a name&s;ake of yours; his name was John Hewit. He has betrayed you. You re|member the circum&s;tance of &s;tealing the hor&s;e at Stilton! Now you &s;ee that hor&s;e has turned out to be a mare&mdash;<Q><L>"And, &s;ays Sir John, the &s;tatutes all declare,</L>
<L>"That man mu&s;t needs be hanged that &s;teals a mare."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="236">
'Come, come,' &s;aid he, 'you are a good fellow, this will do, landlord, bring &s;ome punch. How is he? I love him, the fellow fa&s;cinated me, put powder in my drink; I was planet &s;truck. Why, Sir, I had almo&s;t con&s;ented to face the &s;alt &s;ea and hear the deep mouth cannon, Jove's thunder's counterfeit. Oh!' added he, 'that villainous &s;alt petre &s;hould be dug from the harmle&s;s bowels of the earth, that &s;o many brave fellows have laid low.</P>
<P>'Well, but &s;tay, how is John? I wi&s;h this damned fellow would come with the punch. Here, landlord! Oh, he is as te|dious as a tired hor&s;e! Come, come, we have got it at la&s;t. If you plea&s;e, Sir, we'll drink his health. Here he goes; the &s;tupide&s;t fellow for a head, and the fine&s;t fellow for a heart in the world; "Here's may &s;ucce&s;s attend his plot, and Hannah Higgins be his denonement."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="237">
'Higgins!' continued he, 'What the devil have we got here! Let me twig your buttons&mdash;"Succe&s;s to the Eagle Galley, Thomas Higgins, commander." Have we not Hiren here? He then told me that he had, that morning, &s;een my friend the pilot, who had gone upon a little bu&s;ine&s;s to Saxmundham, from whom he learnt, not only my &s;tory, but that Hewit was &s;afe, and had been pa&s;&s;ed as a pauper to Wolverhampton, which latter intelligence was news to me.</P>
<P>'Seeing di&s;gui&s;e was totally unne|ce&s;&s;ary, we fairly unbent; and as I was taken with a violent fever that very night, and unable to proceed, I &s;ent Walme&s;ley forward with proper in&s;tructions. I knew perfectly well that Hewit had not betrayed me, and that the pre&s;ence of Walme&s;ley would properly entangle the plot of our comedy, till I &s;hould arrive to manage the denouement, and wind up the cata&s;tro|phe.
<PB N="218" REF="238">
This is now done, and you have no|thing to do, by way of perfecting the re|&s;emblance of a drama, but to give your hand to the hero of the piece.'</P>
<P>'And what am I to do,' &s;aid Wal|me&s;ley; I &s;hould have lo&s;t my &s;heep, &s;aid I, an&s;wering him in his own way, if it had not bleated. 'Thy fortune &s;hall be my care,' cried my brother; 'and while I have a guinea you &s;hall freely command a part of it? 'Why then my golden dream is out,' &s;aid Walme&s;ley; 'and it &s;hall be realized,' &s;aid my brother, and I wi&s;h my fortune was ample enough to indulge you in your <HI>menu plai&s;irs,</HI> as you call them.' 'No more of that if thou love&s;t me Hall,' an&s;wered Walme&s;ley.</P>
<P>Having now the &s;anction of my bro|ther's con&s;ent to a marriage with the man I loved, though, I hope, that neither in this in&s;tance, nor in any other, I have ever
<PB N="219" REF="239">
lo&s;t &s;ight of proper feminine delicacy, I will not affect to deny, that I guaranteed my brother's propo&s;al by giving Hewit my hand freely, and without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>On the following Sunday we became man and wife. Good Par&s;on Williams performed the ceremony, my brother gave me away, Mi&s;s Binns and Mi&s;s Williams were the bridemaids, the latter of whom wrote an elegant little poem on the occa|&s;ion, by way of epithalamium, which Wal|me&s;ley repeated, after dinner, with good empha&s;is, and good di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Mr. Smallbrook, and Mr. Gregory, were of the party, and poor Mrs. Crow &s;uperintended the kitchen. The little children I had taught on a Sunday, were all fea&s;ted; the manufacturers through|out the place, either at my in&s;tance, or at the in&s;tance of their employers, who had all a re&s;pect for me, made a jovial day of it; and, except a &s;igh to the memory of
<PB N="220" REF="240">
Binns, who&s;e health we drank after dinner, which both his &s;i&s;ter and I accompanied with a tear, I truly believe that no occa&s;ion, be it ever &s;o popular, or &s;o intere&s;ting, could have diffu&s;ed more general joy among all degrees of per&s;ons, than did, at Wolverhampton, the union of John Hewit and Hannah Higgins.</P>
