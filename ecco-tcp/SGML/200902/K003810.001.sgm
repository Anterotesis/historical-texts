<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM not going to a&s;cribe to you a miracle. I renounce enthu&s;ia&s;m, and think too highly of your under&s;tanding to in&s;ult it by flattery. But, &s;o far as <HI>&s;econd</HI> cau&s;es may be nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil the fiat of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> in the govern|ment of human affairs, I do, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, believe, you were the means of &s;aving me, in the la&s;t &s;ummer, from death.</P>

Not that I laid any &s;tre&s;s on my <HI>own</HI> effort towards it, but becau&s;e the facts were pre-eminently beau|tiful in <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> and courted every addition of fancy, with every embelli&s;hment of the heart.

<P><HI>The tear of Sen&s;ibility</HI> is at once the &s;ofte&s;t and be&s;t evidence of the prai&s;e which it is my ambition to merit on this occa&s;ion: and if it be my lot to enjoy this honour, you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been con|ferred. Notwith&s;tanding this,

<P>YOUR promi&s;es are fair, and the language in which they are ex|pre&s;&s;ed, is proper to your age, and &s;uitable to your character. I ha&s;ten to give you the opportunity you in|vite.&mdash;Re&s;ign your commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash; <HI>that</HI> commi&s;&s;ion which, again&s;t all di&s;&s;ua&s;ive hints, you have &s;olicited and procured. Transfer your &s;word, or el&s;e draw it in the cau&s;e of liberty and heaven. Your &s;chool-fellow, Edward, has, as you know, fallen a victim to the&s;e ho&s;tilities. My dar|ling &s;on is no more. He was plenti|fully provided for in the colonies.&mdash; The &s;pot which he occupied was di&s;|fore&s;ted
<PB N="5" REF="11">
fore&s;ted by his ance&s;tors, who, at the co&s;t of infinite toil, turned to a &s;mi|ling domain, what they found a wil|derne&s;s, inau&s;picious to every purpo&s;e of &s;ociety. It de&s;cended to this un|happy youth ju&s;t as tyranny began to forge chains for freedom; and he traver&s;ed the &s;ea to defend his pro|perty. He would not &s;uffer the le|gacy of his uncle to be ravi&s;hed from him by the &s;poiler, while a hand re|mained to prevent the plunder. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, which before was under the &s;uperintendance of an agent. You know how &s;oon he was invaded,&mdash; how &s;oon his little territory was laid wa&s;te,&mdash; his hou&s;e &s;et fire to&mdash; and how, when the enemy advanced to his door, he was hurried
<PB N="6" REF="12">
into arms. He became a &s;oldier on nece&s;&s;ity. He fought&mdash;He fell!&mdash;</P>
<P>The blow which killed a &s;on had well nigh killed a father al&s;o.&mdash;Yet, in pre&s;ence of Emma and you, I ex|erted my utmo&s;t fortitude. But the wound is not healed; it is &s;till bleed|ing at my heart. To men's eyes it &s;eems well. I have tyed about it a political bandage, yet I &s;ecretly dete&s;t every principle which <HI>begun,</HI> and every motive which <HI>continues,</HI> this <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of America.</HI> Long I have kept the angui&s;h of the&s;e &s;entiments to my&s;elf. It makes no part of my conver&s;ation &mdash;but now, finding your ardour, O my dear Harry, likely to take a wrong direction, it is time to &s;peak&mdash;it is
<PB N="7" REF="13">
time to tell you, what will <HI>lo&s;e</HI> and. what <HI>gain</HI> me for <HI>ever.</HI> Hammond, you are about to engage in a cruel, cau&s;e&mdash;a cau&s;e to which I object both as patriot and as parent. The vigour with which you have &s;ought to ob|tain an authority to go forth <HI>amongst</HI> your countrymen, <HI>again&s;t</HI> your coun|trymen, bears in it &s;omething &s;hock|ing to my nature. Whom I thought tender, I find bloody. Do you de&s;ire to be a hero? the means are ready. Change the po&s;ition of the attack, and <HI>that</HI> will, in it&s;elf, be heroi&s;m. Or, which is &s;till <HI>better,</HI> if you could cultivate the embelli&s;hing arts of peace, and the Mu&s;es who love you, apologize to your patron the Earl, for the trouble you have given&mdash;take
<PB N="8" REF="14">
the hand of Emma Corbett, and, with her, &s;hare the fortunes of her father.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments declare my opi|nion of your honour; and my e&s;teem for your per&s;on is expre&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ents I tender. Perceiving how ob&s;tinately you were bent to aid this fallacious plot again&s;t the rights of nature and mankind, I thought to let you go blindly on to blacken yet more the catalogue of Briti&s;h oppre&s;|&s;ors. But I well knew the &s;ource and progre&s;s of that &s;entiment which unites you to my only &s;urviving child.

<P>No greater time is nece&s;&s;ary to determine, than that which will be taken up in penning the determi|nation. I <HI>do</HI> venerate your tru&s;t. My principles make &s;acred every man's private opinion; but the very &s;ame principles compel me to forfeit even <HI>your</HI> affection, &s;ir, if it is to be pre&s;erved at the price of my duty.

points of view, and yet be friends? Both may act from feeling, and both on principle. You imagine America is aggrieved, while I look upon <HI>her</HI> as the aggre&s;&s;or. What of that? do we interfere with the opinions of each other? I was not acce&s;&s;ary to the death of your &s;on; and had it been my fate to meet him in the field, I can conceive the point on which nature would have in&s;i&s;ted. She would gracefully have led us both, a little from the line of duty, and &s;pared one in &s;ympathy to the other. Nay, more. Had I &s;een the &s;word tremble at his bo&s;om, my own &s;hould for that mo|ment have been as a &s;hield, and you know not <HI>how</HI> far I would have ven|tured for the brother of Emma. But

how the &s;oft emotions agitate the heart at the command of your affecting pen!

Every varying &s;en&s;ation took its turn to reign: at one moment I was &s;oothed, at another chilled. What feeling of the &s;oul did not alternately a&s;&s;ert its dominion?

Ah, that Emma were an all|accompli&s;hed judge, who&s;e plaudits might reflect all the honour which, my hero de&s;erves to receive! This being impo&s;&s;ible, let it &s;uffice, that you have, in the&s;e tender effu&s;ions, furni&s;hed your Emma with new proofs of tenderne&s;s, though none were ne|ce&s;&s;ary

<P>Yet mu&s;t I not, and ought I not, to tremble while I prai&s;e? O, this Ame|rica, my Henry! The&s;e chances of war! A theatre of mi&s;chief already fatal to the lover of Loui&s;a&mdash;I faint under the thought! The time &s;teals on, even while I am talking of its

<P>ALAS! what is to be done with this bleeding tenderne&s;s of yours? For Heaven's &s;ake, temper your &s;en|&s;ibility with a little di&s;cretion, my be|loved Emma. Your elegant and af|fecting pages penetrate me to the &s;oul. Thetears of angui&s;h mingle with tho&s;e of admiration as I read them.

The <HI>future</HI> is a wide &s;pace, and may contain within its circle a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings. Struggle then again&s;t the &s;torm bravely. Your in|ferences are too gloomy: various op|portunities will offer, doubt not, to &s;peed our generous intercour&s;e. The wide world of &s;entiment and &s;en&s;a|tion
<PB N="52" REF="58">
&s;till opens upon us. By aid of this little friendly in&s;trument, we may range through tho&s;e paths which ocean &s;eems to &s;eparate.

Look, Emma, at the paltry pa&s;&s;ions, and vul|gar gratifications of common life&mdash;of common lovers. Look attentively at the&s;e, and then examine your own heart&mdash;examine mine. Con&s;ider the pure nature of the affection that unites them&mdash;Does not the &s;uperi|ority
<PB N="53" REF="59">
of our attachment make you generou&s;ly proud? O, Emma! you ought not to be wretched. We have both rea&s;on to be content.</P>
<P>Does Emma &s;till weep? Let her rather gratefully acknowledge, that though this pure &s;ource of &s;acred amity is occa&s;ionally embittered, as is, more or le&s;s, <HI>every</HI> affection of the virtuous heart&mdash;there are moments in which happine&s;s breaks forth with a lu&s;tre that makes amends for every intervening vexation. Such was the period, when I wrote tho&s;e ha&s;ty lines which you have honoured with mo&s;t dear prai&s;e. In &s;triking the balance then, let us not complain, my friend; but, when fretting at di&s;appointment,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
or drooping under the languors of di&s;tre&s;s, let us &s;upport our&s;elves with the a&s;&s;urance, that the rich current will return after all ob&s;tructions, and flow &s;weetly and &s;moothly along its pro|per channels. Its &s;ource, my dear Emma, can never be exhau&s;ted. It is as the chry&s;tal fountain of living wa|ter, which &s;treams for ever, and &s;uf|fers no impurity to remain upon its &s;urface.</P>
<P>Ah! what is there &s;o likely to melt the &s;pirit of a &s;oldier into cowardice, as the tears of Emma? She will not then give <HI>way</HI> to the tender torrent. She will court the balmy ble&s;&s;ings of ea&s;e and hope. She will check the&s;e convul&s;ive tran&s;ports of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o
<PB N="55" REF="61">
de&s;tructive to my honour, and her own health. She will buffet the wild waves of adver&s;ity, nor thus &s;uffer them to overwhelm her. Con&s;ider of the&s;e things, O my beloved Emma! Come then, my friend, be &s;till your|&s;elf; repo&s;e with perfect confidence upon that faithful pillow which my affection prepares for you; &s;eek to amu&s;e and to &s;olace; cea&s;e to mur|mur and repine.</P>
<P>Do the&s;e things, and all your ge|nerous wi&s;hes &s;hall be rewarded&mdash;Do the&s;e things, and all &s;hall be well. Peace &s;hall revi&s;it your gentle bo&s;om, and &s;pread her white&s;t plumes about your pillow.</P>

<P>IT may not be, my brother. I can|not &s;ee you in the la&s;t hours of your &s;tay in England: I love you too dearly to &s;upport it. It is not even now, without pain, I hold the pen. My tenderne&s;s is too &s;trong, and my con&s;titution too weak, to bear &s;uch an interview&mdash;to bear the tears of Emma, the embraces of my brother, and my own di&s;tre&s;s. Excu&s;e me, therefore. It is true affection that per&s;uades me to retire. I will not unman you, nor add to the weight of Emma's &s;ympa|thy.

<P>THE appointment is made, and I &s;hall, by a lucky arrangement, be able to pa&s;s with you &s;ome hours of elegant di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>YOU have found then, it &s;eems, Loui&s;a's billet, making the offer of her hou&s;e this evening to Emma and to Henry. By what chance the note dropt I am ignorant. The hand of agitation is not, indeed, &s;teady; nor can the agonized heart guard again&s;t common chances. I am not &s;orry that the paper, by whatever means, has got into <HI>your</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, oh, my dear father! It takes &s;ome part of the load from my bo&s;om; for I am hurt to appear plotting that, which will &s;o thoroughly bear explanation. You
<PB N="71" REF="77">
de&s;ire Mr. Hammond to vi&s;it me no more. He obeys. You reque&s;t that I would, without enquiring into rea|&s;ons, forbear to &s;peak of him to you. I am obedient. You de&s;ired that my utmo&s;t intere&s;t might be tried, to keep him from America. O, you can con|jecture how <HI>readily,</HI> and, as you know Henry's darling pa&s;&s;ion, you may gue&s;s how <HI>vainly,</HI> I undertook this. The double plea&s;ure of obliging you, my father, and of gratifying my own fond heart, prevailed with me to urge this point, till I had well nigh turned his affection to di&s;gu&s;t. You bid me cea&s;e to love, and with the utmo&s;t in|genuou&s;ne&s;s I tell you it impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible, my dear father, becau&s;e repugnant to every principle by which
<PB N="72" REF="78">
all the actions of my life have been governed.</P>
<P>My regard&mdash;O! that is too cold a word&mdash;my <HI>love,</HI> for Henry, is not, you know, the &s;tart of a moment, the ro|mantic &s;ally of a warm temper, nor the effect of that &s;illy admiration, which pays down the tribute of folly to the charms of a red coat. I &s;e|cretly grieve that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms &s;hould have been cho&s;en: I have &s;hed too many tears to the memory of my <HI>brother,</HI> to be in love with re|gimentals: but my tenderne&s;s was antecedent to all the&s;e misfortunes; nor will it be in the power of any misfortune to dimini&s;h what your judgment, and the eloquence of my
<PB N="73" REF="79">
own heart, have &s;o long approved. Your pre&s;ent avowed di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Mr. Hammond is &s;udden; but &s;ettled affection cannot readily ac|commodate it&s;elf to &s;uch revolutions. What is rooted in nature cannot, without much labour, be eradicated by art. As it di&s;plea&s;es you, &s;ir, I am concerned at this. But &s;hall I deceive, in order to make my peace? Shall I be <HI>unnatural,</HI> in order to be <HI>filial?</HI> Shall I propen&s;ely, &s;et one great duty again&s;t another, and &s;o de&s;troy the excellence of both? No. You would hate me for it, and I &s;hould hate my|&s;elf. That I am, in this bitter pe|riod, when I am about to lo&s;e what, you your&s;elf &s;o lately thought mo&s;t precious, able to write with &s;o much
<PB N="74" REF="80">
argumentative compo&s;ure, is, alas! no &s;ign of my indifference, but an in|&s;tance&mdash;perhaps the &s;tronge&s;t that could be given&mdash;of that &s;teady attach|ment, which, born of honour, is nou|ri&s;hed by virtue. To be <HI>attached,</HI> is the dictate of nature. To be attached to a man of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>morals,</HI> is the dictate of delicacy; and the &s;ymptom, I conceive, of a good di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;Such, my mo&s;t honoured father, were the elementary rules I caught from you. Would you controvert your own maxims? Or, while the merit of the object increa&s;es, is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love, which na|ture and common &s;en&s;e &s;eem to &s;ay &s;hould increa&s;e in proportion?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81">But you depend, I find, on the le|nitives of ab&s;ence, and the oblivions of time. I will not an&s;wer for the vi|gour of my own mind, for I know the frailty of our nature. If it is &s;ooth|ing to my father to count upon what the&s;e things <HI>may</HI> do, let me not de|&s;troy his &s;ource of expectation. I am not, thanks to <HI>his</HI> correcter culture, enough the giddy girl to bur&s;t forth into a&s;&s;everations of <HI>con&s;tancy ever|la&s;ting,</HI> merely to vex a parent by <HI>&s;etting my heart</HI> again&s;t his wi&s;hes: I would de&s;ire rather to di&s;tru&s;t my own temper; and, laying my affecti|ons open to his view, beg him to form his judgment upon a &s;urvey of them. But I dare not mi&s;lead one who hath &s;o entire a right to be treated frankly.
<PB N="76" REF="82">
I make no vows; yet, in proportion as an attachment is deliberate, is it not &s;tationary? and this being my fir&s;t and only affection, (having be&s;ides a man of unblemi&s;hed character and conge|nial manners for its object) have I not a right &s;trongly to &s;u&s;pect&mdash;but enjoy the opinion you &s;o &s;trongly adopt. Ble&s;s you, my father, for the gentlene&s;s of your inhibitions. You do not threaten&mdash;You do not rave. The&s;e might have augmented my di&s;|tre&s;s, but could not have abated my affection. A circum&s;tance of which parents &s;eem &s;o uncon&s;cious, they de&s;troy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it. They confu&s;e, but do not convince: terrify, but do not conciliate; and al|mo&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="83">
ju&s;tify di&s;obedience, by their manner of enforcing duty.</P>
<P>Oh heaven! the clock is &s;triking&mdash; the hour is come&mdash;the minute&mdash;the moment, is approaching. I will ring for a &s;ervant to take this into the par|lour. My feet will &s;carcely carry me down &s;tairs. An ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity, &s;ir&mdash;will you refu&s;e? Oh, my father, my father, my &s;pirits have done their utmo&s;t, ere the trial is begun.

<P>THE wind is &s;till in&s;ufficient, and the little which &s;tirs is adver&s;e, which has given me an opportunity to receive the only part of your per&s;on that could, con&s;i&s;tently, attend me on the ocean. Do you know that this dear locket has made me poetical. You mu&s;t allow for ver&s;es written upon the waves. Yet I hate apology. They have &s;oothed a pen&s;ive hour for me, and may do the &s;ame for you.</P>

<P>THE pro&s;pect, Corbett, is not clear, I find; but &s;omething im|pels me to try whether it may not be improved. I &s;u&s;pect, however, that a youth of twenty-five in &s;carlet will leave an impre&s;&s;ion &s;carce to be era&s;ed by a middle-aged man in a &s;uit of &s;nuff-colour, with &s;la&s;h &s;leeves, after the manner of our ance&s;tors: and it is too late now, Charles, to throw off a cu&s;tom that has hung on my back for more than twenty years. Yet I will come; for I <HI>want</HI> the &s;tability of dome&s;tic comfort after all my mi|grations.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">Your daughter &s;trikes me as the very woman, and has, in my eye, no other fault than that of being too <HI>young,</HI> which I quarrel with chiefly becau&s;e I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect &s;he will think me too <HI>old.</HI> No matter, I will put the be&s;t foot forward, and be with you in a day or two.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO HENRY HAMMOND, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a return have you made for the trifle I &s;ent you, O, mo&s;t dear and ingenious friend! ever directing the current of that rich &s;tream (which knows no diminu|tion, but &s;catters fertility and fra|grance as it flows) to comfort, to amu&s;e, or to in&s;truct me. How I re|joice, that the bagatelle plea&s;ed you. It was my fir&s;t intention to have the hair di&s;po&s;ed into an ornament for the &s;hirt, but I con&s;idered the nature of that delicate &s;entiment you feel for Emma. I reflected that it was <HI>retired,</HI> that it &s;hunned every thing obtru&s;ive, that it could ill brook the idle, and
<PB N="101" REF="107">
perhaps, the wanton curio&s;ity of tho&s;e cockaded heroes, who imagine ten|derne&s;s incompatible with bravery. On the&s;e accounts, therefore, I cho&s;e to &s;uit my locket to <HI>that</HI> &s;ituation only in which your delicate partiality would be mo&s;t likely to place it.</P>
<P>Round your neck, my dear Henry, let it ever hang, impervious to every eye but that of the proprietor&mdash;A &s;acred tali&s;man may it prove&mdash;a &s;oft &s;hield thrown over your bo&s;om by the trembling hand of a friend!&mdash;O, that I could breathe upon it all the virtues that were &s;uppo&s;ed to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t benevolent ge|nii&mdash;that it had &s;trength of charm &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve you as &s;ecurely
<PB N="102" REF="108">
from &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow, and mi&s;chance, &mdash;from the bullet and the &s;word,&mdash; as I do firmly believe the &s;ight and touch of it will arm your heart again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of every error, and the practice of every irregularity.</P>
<P>Your letter, with its fair and tuneful inclo&s;ure, found me upon my pillow, from which I ha&s;tened with a rapidity which is the &s;pontaneous impul&s;e of unaffected tenderne&s;s. Like a much wi&s;hed-for and much wanted cordial it found me in an affecting moment. I read and recovered, wept and was well. Oh, wondrous power of virtu|ous affection! Yes, thou admirable and honourable friend, the die is ca&s;t, your invaluable love &s;hall be the &s;u&s;|taining
<PB N="103" REF="109">
taining &s;olace of my future exi&s;tence. Ah! may no jarring word or di&s;cor|dant thought ever ri&s;e up to di&s;turb an amity &s;o &s;acred and &s;o pure! The fine &s;pirit of our e&s;teem, my Henry, &s;hall extend its delicate influence over all the rougher pa&s;&s;ages, on a &s;ea far more &s;tormy than that who&s;e bo&s;om is now pre&s;&s;ed by your ve&s;&s;el&mdash;Over every troubled moment our affection &s;hall &s;oftly diffu&s;e it&s;elf,</P>
<Q><L>Like the &s;weet breezes of the South,</L>
<L>Stealing and giving odour.</L></Q>
<P>Oh, Henry, my heart dilates as I write, and the &s;oft drops de&s;cend in a pathetic and &s;weet a&s;&s;urance of our future felicity; but do not be unea&s;y that I weep,&mdash; &s;uch tears will not hurt
<PB N="104" REF="110">
me. They are precious drops that invigorate virtue, and fre&s;hen as they fall. Oh! tho&s;e &s;acred hours we have pa&s;&s;ed together, in friend&s;hip, in con|ver&s;e, in books; no divided atten|tion, thought &s;aluting thought, the mutual tear, every thing, or dear or elegant, included in every moment. Carry the remembrance of &s;uch inter|cour&s;e over the world of waters. Call to mind the time when our lengthened attention to the moral page, in&s;tead of relaxing, grew &s;tronger and more fixed; when our understandings and our hearts &s;eemed equally to refine and to expand!</P>
<P>Yes, Henry, I will try to adopt that gentle &s;pirit of prophecy, which
<PB N="105" REF="111">
breathes &s;o beautiful an ardour over your con&s;olatory pages. I do not <HI>ex|pect</HI> to gather the bloom of the ro&s;e, without feeling the puncture of the &s;urrounding thorn. I gratefully take it with all its little wounding appen|dages&mdash;I place it in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>&mdash;I have promi&s;ed not to repine: yet if a gentle murmur &s;ometimes e&s;|capes, let me, I prithee, find indul|gence for it, and do not chide me; oh, how often have I wi&s;hed &s;ince your departure, to be the companion of your voyage and all its con&s;equences, however multiplied, however mena|cing! And after all, Henry, your &s;itu|ation is more tolerable than mine: the travelling friend has the advantage of
<PB N="106" REF="112">
tho&s;e who are left, in &s;olitude, behind. The very velocity of the motion is favourable: in pa&s;&s;ing rapidly along, the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, and the change of objects, engage and divert the mind in&s;en&s;ibly; while the poor forlorn one, that remains fixed to the former re|&s;idence, has only to mark the pre&s;ent period, to look in vain around for what is lo&s;t, to ca&s;t a "longing, lin|gering eye" upon the pa&s;t, and, in the torture of reflection to confe&s;s that &s;uch things <HI>were,</HI> but <HI>are</HI> alas! no more.</P>
<P>It was my fortune to pa&s;s through the &s;treet where you re&s;ided, more than once &s;ince your departure. O, think with what emotions I viewed
<PB N="107" REF="113">
tho&s;e windows which belonged to an apartment &s;o lately yours! The &s;ight of your <HI>grave</HI> could &s;carcely have produced any thing more affecting: and yet I feel that I &s;hall like to pa&s;s often by them. I do not pretend to <HI>account</HI> for the&s;e little touches, I only &s;imply <HI>relate</HI> them. Will not your feeling nature ea&s;ily explain them?</P>
<P>And now confe&s;s, Hammond, that I have arrived at the due degree of heroi&s;m: confe&s;s, that I am &s;uffici|ently <HI>&s;oldier'd;</HI> for I can hold the pen, and impre&s;s the quiet-&s;eeming &s;enti|ment, with my eyes full of tears, and my heart full of &s;orrow. What more can you expect from female philo&s;o|phy? What more can you expect
<PB N="108" REF="114">
from a friend who has been u&s;ed to regret the ab&s;ence of an hour as a misfortune?</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end off this, on the &s;light chance of its reaching you. If it &s;hould not&mdash;what then?&mdash;what will be its fate?&mdash;I care not. Gro&s;s as is the world, were every &s;entiment of my &s;oul laid open to its view, I could &s;upport the &s;crutiny. I &s;till could <HI>"boa&s;t</HI> the graceful weakne&s;s," if in|deed it be a weakne&s;s of my heart. The <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of your receiving my letter is worth the hazard of di&s;patch|ing it; and as every moment is now at the caprice of the wind, I will no longer delay &s;ealing. Adieu!</P>

<P>My brother and <HI>your</HI> friend, then is gone! how fares it with you, my dear Emma? Are the conflicting pangs of a parting &s;o poignant &s;ome|what &s;ub&s;ided, the tender &s;pirits &s;ome|what compo&s;ed, the fluttered, agita|ted heart more &s;till? I a&s;k you the&s;e que&s;tions in the bo&s;om of my retreat. I date from my &s;anctuary, where my widowed heart (for <HI>that</HI> has been long wedded) is retired to mu&s;e upon the dead. Of the living, you, one other per&s;on, and Henry, are the only ob|jects of my care. For your welfare and for your di&s;tre&s;s I can yet feel, and while you remain in it, the
<PB N="113" REF="119">
world will have &s;omething that ties me to it&mdash;the re&s;t is Edward's.</P>
<P>Fifteen months of de&s;peration are gone by, my friend, and five more have followed tho&s;e, le&s;s clamorous, but more deep. The frenzy of my &s;oul is &s;ucceeded by the &s;till &s;mall &s;igh, and &s;ilent tear of &s;ettled &s;orrow. It is not now the <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> but the <HI>prin|ciple</HI> of grief.

<P>&mdash;Amid&s;t the mode&s;t &s;hadings of the evening, I behold her cele&s;tial form de&s;eending on a moon-beam.

<P>The retreat is tender: the weather is fair. Clo&s;e upon my cot, Simpli|city &s;eems to have fixed her &s;eat of "deare&s;t re&s;idence." She has &s;eque&s;|tered her&s;elf in a bower of &s;hrubs, at who&s;e roots rambles the fertilizing rill. My &s;hades are formed to receive and to embrace the gentle &s;pirit of acquie&s;cence. Repo&s;ed in the thick|e&s;t foliage, the &s;aintly form of Melan|choly al&s;o is there, li&s;tening to the plaint of the &s;tock dove, and to the &s;oft gradations of the water-fall. Is not this an a&s;ylum for the <HI>heart</HI> of

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I SAID I would tell you how we de|ceive our&s;elves. I will. The <HI>&s;lender circum&s;tances,</HI> and even the <HI>great misfortunes</HI> of a lover, are no kind of objection in the eyes of a <HI>&s;entimental mi&s;tre&s;s;</HI> embara&s;&s;ments of the world call forth the <HI>finer</HI> &s;entiments, and tho&s;e excite &s;ympathy. Now <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> Frederick, is, in the female brea&s;t, a very tender &s;en&s;ation. It is a &s;trange thing, but a true, that this &s;ame ado|rable SENTIMENT has ever had (with indeed very few exceptions) a mo&s;t &s;ore quarrel with &s;olid &s;ilver and gold; and with the coin current of a coun|try. In the account of young <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="138">
women (who are the greate&s;t wor|&s;hippers of the fair idol) it really cir|culates as mo&s;t <HI>&s;terling;</HI> and the pre|vailing charms of a pathetic, poetical poverty is a more welcome draft to them, than any which mere <HI>matter-of-fact wealth</HI> could draw upon his banker. Thus it is, that fathers &s;a|crifice to Plutus, and children (e&s;pe|cially daughters) to a beggarly Deity, whom Plutus laughs to &s;corn: and hence the &s;ource of ten-thou&s;and fa|mily feuds&mdash;hence the ri&s;e of &s;epa|rate maintenance; and the fall of dome&s;tic confidence. Sentimental Love is torn almo&s;t to tatters in his way to the altar; and when, in this effort, his robe is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ragged, <HI>then</HI> is his glory the <HI>mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed;</HI> for,

thus beggarly as he is, he &s;hall laugh at the labours of a <HI>rich</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, and as. he pa&s;&s;es, poverty-&s;truck (as it &s;hould &s;eem) through files of females, he will flaunt his famine in your face, and <HI>&s;entimentally</HI> tell you, it is his <HI>letter of recommendation.</HI> And all this, Frederick, while plain affection (in a &s;nuff-coloured coat for in&s;tance) throws in <HI>vain</HI> the ma&s;&s;y money bag acro&s;s his &s;houlders, and &s;eeks Hy|men's temple by the path that is ob|vious and unentangled, Now-a-days, the broad highway is de&s;erted; and the women rather <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to &s;tick tho&s;e ro&s;es in the bo&s;om that are en|compa&s;&s;ed by <HI>thorns,</HI> than accept the riche&s;t <HI>boquet</HI> in the garden that lies open to the view, ready to the hand,

and that may be collected without any difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Difficulty!</HI> there it is again. That is <HI>another</HI> cur&s;ed thing which enters into the &s;pirit of a modern attach|ment! It is the fir&s;t cou&s;in of &s;enti|ment, or, as I have heard, its parent. A &s;ly old neighbour of mine, who has looked &s;hrewdly and &s;ilently at human nature, and whom I, &s;ometimes, u&s;ed to con&s;ult on that &s;ubject, tells me, that <HI>difficulty</HI> is the happie&s;t thing in the world to &s;entimental lovers. I hinted to my friend in reply to this, that I then might con&s;ider my age, my dark complexion, my wig, and my fair round body, as &s;o many points in my <HI>favour,</HI> &s;ince they would, no

<P>It is on this account, Frederick, that I regret having &s;een the fair Emma Corbett. My partiality is not, I find, &s;uch a one as I can accommo|date to my old habit of quaint jocu|larity.

It is a little hard, that you have got me into &s;uch an exigence as to make it im|po&s;&s;ible for me, with any credit, to keep the great &s;ecret of my life.</P>
<P>Henry Hammond is, again&s;t all advice, and per&s;ua&s;ion, violently at|tached to tho&s;e cruel <HI>&s;poilers,</HI> who have gone &s;word in hand into the bowels of a country, where my dear &s;on has fallen a victim&mdash;a country which is mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly butchered, and to who&s;e welfare I am bound by ties the mo&s;t tender and intere&s;ting.

<P>YOU a&s;toni&s;h me. I imagined <HI>you</HI> were, like <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> a citizen of the earth, and of no particular party. For my <HI>own</HI> part, I have <HI>travelled</HI> away all enthu&s;ia&s;m of the &s;ort you mention.

happy to contemplate the &s;cenes of England than tho&s;e of India&mdash;that I rate more highly my <HI>own</HI> than I do a <HI>foreign</HI> language&mdash;that I look with fonde&s;t partiality at the &s;pot (which is marked in everla&s;ting traces on the memory) devoted to the pa&s;times of my infancy, and that I continue &s;ome &s;ort of grateful tenderne&s;s for the very <HI>trees,</HI> who&s;e &s;hades &s;o often &s;oothed me in the &s;ummer of my childhood. My predilection for my native country, friend Corbett, 'hath this extent&mdash;no more'. It has been my fate to travel&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid&mdash;wherever Euro|peans are di&s;per&s;ed. I have travelled too, where civil &s;ociety hath yet made no progre&s;s, but I have <HI>never</HI> travel|led (and oh <HI>may</HI> I never) where the
<PB N="167" REF="173">
"human face divine" did not meet my eye. However varied by colour, by tint, and by feature, I &s;aw enough to di&s;cover my <HI>kind,</HI> and to acknow|ledge it. I di&s;puted not about the white or black, the tawny, or the yellow; nor about the different mix|ture, &s;hade, or di&s;tinction of the&s;e&mdash; I &s;aw beings of the &s;ame erect form&mdash;I &s;aw MY SPECIES; and in this very &s;e|rious moment I declare to you, that I felt attachment to the general figures of men and women, wherever I be|held them, even before I knew any thing of their particular di&s;po&s;itions. In looking more clo&s;e, I beheld among&s;t every people, whether &s;avage or civilized, many things to like, and many to di&s;like: but not <HI>one</HI> to cut
<PB N="168" REF="174">
them wholly from my tenderne&s;s. Foremo&s;t of tho&s;e points, Corbett, which <HI>hurt</HI> me, were the bickerings that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between one &s;tate and another. In pa&s;&s;ing through a vari|ety of countries, and &s;eeing them <HI>all,</HI> either <HI>engaging, preparing</HI> to engage, or healing the wounds of an engage|ment <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> I began to think the pa&s;&s;ion for honourable death (i.e. cutting throats and lopping limbs for &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence or for glory, for pride or pique) was univer&s;ally peculiar to the&s;e ages of iron and &s;teel; till, devoting a cool hour to examine the map of the world, and perceiving that, from the creation (or very &s;oon after) even unto this day, to &s;hed blood in this manner has been the <HI>con&s;tant practice,</HI> I gave up
<PB N="169" REF="175">
the idea of calling my fellow-creatures cruel or &s;anguinary upon this account, and <HI>deplored</HI> a cu&s;tom which I could not <HI>approve.</HI> Yet, in every army are characters to be loved; and the hu|man affections &s;pread them&s;elves, more or le&s;s, over every clime. In con&s;i|dering the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of wars, between different proportions of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies, (of whom numbers without num|ber have been &s;lain) I have found them &s;o wretchedly inadequate to the horrible <HI>effects,</HI> that I have often melted into tears, but never have been inflamed with anger. Tens of thou|&s;ands, my friend, have been &s;acrificed to the frown of a favourite, the whim of a prince, or the &s;mile of a pro&s;ti|tute. The <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> are contemptible,
<PB N="170" REF="176">
but the <HI>event</HI> is murder. What can a good-natured man do, but commi&s;e|rate the abu&s;e of power, and the mad|ne&s;s of ambition? In point of <HI>pro|priety</HI> there is &s;eldom a pin to choo&s;e on either &s;ide; and even when it is Ju&s;tice her&s;elf that draws the &s;word, and heads the phalanx, the blood of many an innocent is &s;hed in the con|te&s;t; and in the warme&s;t moment of &s;ucce&s;s, while victory is enjoying her jubilee,&mdash; if all the milk of human kindne&s;s were not drained out of the hero's bo&s;om&mdash;there is as much cau&s;e for him to &s;orrow, as to rejoice. Oh Mr. Corbett, were he to retire <HI>after</HI> the &s;hout of acclamation to &s;ome quiet &s;olitude, and there think on the means by which the conque&s;t has been
<PB N="171" REF="177">
gained&mdash;were he to con&s;ider, that heaps of his <HI>countrymen</HI> as well as of the <HI>enemy (all</HI> of whom were human beings) lie cut to pieces upon the plain&mdash;while <HI>another</HI> heap, yet more to be regretted, are groaning in ho&s;|pitals&mdash;would not the laurel wither on his brow? would not the &s;en&s;e of rapture be checked, &s;ympathy &s;tream from his eye, and recoiling horror freeze up the blood about his heart? Such are my opinions. I caught them, my friend, from the fountain|head of a mo&s;t touching <HI>experience.</HI> They flowed immediately from the <HI>wounds</HI> of my fellow creatures. Ap|pointed to the office of &s;urgeon, at a period of <HI>war,</HI> in the earlier part of my life, it was the fortune of our &s;hip
<PB N="172" REF="178">
more than once to feel the &s;hocks of public ho&s;tility. I had &s;o much bu&s;i|ne&s;s upon my <HI>hands</HI> that it was almo&s;t too much for my <HI>heart.</HI> At the con|clu&s;ion of the voyage, an opportunity offered to quit my cruel &s;tation, and I readily embraced it. Since that time I have kept my&s;elf unengaged from &s;cenes for which nature did not form me: and I am not of any party. I dete&s;t war, and the <HI>thoughts</HI> of war, but I &s;incerely wi&s;h well to every hu|man creature. That England is at variance with her colonies is unhappy. In both countries I have friends who are dear to me. In both I have pro|perty.
