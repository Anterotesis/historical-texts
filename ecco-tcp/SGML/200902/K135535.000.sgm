<P>THE reputation of the following <HI>POEMS</HI> is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it would be u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay more of them at pre&s;ent, than what may be nece&s;&s;ary to gratify future curio&s;ity. It is there|fore &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that through the medium of a <HI>DAILY PRINT,</HI> they were fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the Public, and obtained that general notice, to which they are &s;o eminently, and &s;o ju&s;tly en|titled.</P>
<P>It ought, however, to be recorded, of the cele|brated corre&s;pondence between <HI>DELLA CRUSCA</HI> and <HI>ANNA MATILDA,</HI> that <HI>its genuine enthu|&s;ia&s;m</HI> aro&s;e entirely from poetical Sympathy; for till immediately before the publication of The <HI>In|terview,</HI> they were totally unacquainted with each other, and reciprocally unknown.</P>
