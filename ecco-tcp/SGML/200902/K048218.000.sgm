<L>REASON, (a dame not often in the wrong)</L>
<L>Bethought, (for much to think is Rea&s;on giv'n)</L>
<L>On what is ill, and what is left undone,</L>
<L>And how di&s;pos'd of all the gifts of Heav'n.</L>

<L>Perceiving Fortune off could fling her hood,</L>

<L>Within a &s;acred grove (to peace con&s;ign'd)</L>
<L>A branch by Fortune from the Laurel torn,</L>

<L>She &s;aid&mdash;"by Victory let this be worn!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Victory the &s;culptur'd arch was rais'd</L>
<L>High o'er the &s;moaking ruins of a town!</L>
<L>And bells rang loud, and every window blaz'd,</L>

<L>In glittering letters great of beaming gold,</L>
<L>Fair Honor's fount &s;he &s;eem'd to have imbib'd,</L>
<L>In &s;ooth, her form was gracious to behold.</L>

</LG>

<L>In proud cathedrals why Te Deum rai&s;e?</L>
<L>Say, why to Victory the choral joy?</L>
<L>Such &s;ongs, indeed, were pure immortal prai&s;e,</L>
