<P><HI>_THE De&s;cription of Three Hun|dred Animals,</HI> the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay of this kind, for the u&s;e of young People, having been favourably received; encouraged me to make this Second Collection of <HI>Animals,</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> which, I hope, will prove as &s;ucce&s;sful as the former: I have &s;ome rea&s;on to expect it; be|cau&s;e every Invention and Improvement, that tends to delight and plea&s;e young Per&s;ons, (that this does &s;o, is already manife&s;ted by Experi|ence) will undoubtedly be a fre&s;h Motive to engage their Attention.</P>
<P>The Minds of Youth, like their bodily Ap|petites, require to be fed with &s;ome &s;uitable Entertainment; the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Things be|ing wont to cloy by long and frequent U&s;e. Na|tural Hi&s;tory is an inexhau&s;tible Subject, which will furni&s;h them with a boundle&s;s Variety of Things, fit to exerci&s;e their inqui&s;itive Minds. And I cannot help thinking, that to encou|rage Youth in reading this Subject, mu&s;t be of real Benefit, both now and hereafter. It will introduce them into a habit of Read|ing, from their natural Propen&s;ity to view the Pictures, read the Names, and Hi&s;tory of the Creatures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which all &s;eem delighted with. But the great and chief Service it will be to them hereafter, is bringing them acquainted with the <HI>GREAT CREA|TOR</HI> of all the&s;e Things, by contemplating his &s;tupendious Works: It will afford a delightful Satisfaction, to &s;earch into Nature, to trace
<PB REF="4">her Foot&s;teps, and the various Methods &s;he takes to bring her Works to Perfection. In|deed, it cannot be expected, that Children can under&s;tand the&s;e Things, or be able to make a right U&s;e of them: But by tuition, Per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t Capacity may be made to know, <HI>That the Lord made the earth by his pow|er, e&s;tabli&s;hed the world by his wi&s;dom, and &s;tretched out the heaven by his under|&s;tanding,</HI> Jer. <HI>li. 15.</HI> And that he hath re|pleni&s;hed the Earth whereon we dwell, with variety of Plants, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ome for U&s;e, &s;ome for Ornament, and &s;ome for Delight; which give daily demon&s;tration of the Wi&s;dom, Power, and Goodne&s;s of the Maker and Sup|porter of all the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>A new Study &s;eems at fir&s;t to &s;ome Per&s;ons hard, intricate, and difficult; but after a little re&s;olution and progre&s;s; after they be|come a little acquainted with it, their Under|&s;tandings are wonderfully cleared up and en|larged, the Difficulties vani&s;h, and the Thing grows ea&s;y, familiar, and plea&s;ant. And &s;ure I am; &s;uch &s;tudies as the&s;e are va&s;tly &s;uperior to the Tales, Fables, and Stories of Love, u&s;ed in Schools, and de&s;erve the regard of Parents and Teachers; as conducing more to the Honour of God, and the real Benefit of Youth. And for our Encouragement in this Study, ob&s;erve what the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith; <HI>The works of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all them that have plea&s;ure therein,</HI> P&s;al. <HI>cxi. 2.</HI> Which though it is principally &s;poken of the Works of Providence, yet may as well he verified of the Works of the Creation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>BOOK the Fir&s;t.</HI> Of Four-footed BEASTS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 1. _IS a kind of WILD GOAT bred in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which is call'd, in <HI>Latin, Capricerva;</HI> becau&s;e they partake of the Deer and Goat. The Inhabitants other|wi&s;e call them BEZOAR, from whence the Name of <HI>Bezoar</HI> ari&s;es. This Animal is very nimble, &s;o that he will skip from Rock to Rock. and is dangerous to the Hunter; for he will defend him&s;elf, and &s;ome|times kills the <HI>Indians</HI> that pur&s;ue him. The Head of this Creature re&s;embles that of the He-goat. The Horns are very black; and are bended almo&s;t to his Back. The Body is covered with an a&s;h-colour'd Hair, inclining to red, much &s;horter than that of the Goat, and neare&s;t to the Deer's. The Tail is &s;hort, and turns up again: The Legs are pretty thick; and the Feet are cleft, like tho&s;e of the Goat. <HI>Bezoar</HI> is a Stone, produced in &s;everal Parts of the Belly of this Goat. It is taken, likewi&s;e, out of the Bellies of cer|tain other Animals in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> It is found in Balls of different &s;izes and &s;hapes; for &s;ome are as big
<PB N="2" REF="7">as a Wall-nut; others as a Hazel-nut, (this &s;ort, they &s;ay, is taken from a kind of <HI>Ape,</HI> that is found parti|cularly in a certain I&s;land of <HI>America</HI>) and &s;ome as a large Pea. Some are round, others oval, flat, or bunch|ed. The Superfices of all the &s;orts are &s;mooth, poli&s;h'd, &s;hining, of an olive or grey Colour; and is made u&s;e of in Medicine.</P>
<P><HI>Fig. 2.</HI> The MUSK-GOAT is of the &s;hape and colour of a Hind, only it has a longer Body: It is pro|duced in the Kingdoms of <HI>Boutan, Tunquin,</HI> and &s;e|veral other Parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It frequents the Woods and Fore&s;ts, where they hunt it; and when it is kill'd, they cut out the Bladder, or Pouch, as big as a Hen's Egg, which is found under the Belly; then they &s;eparate the coagulated Blood, which they dry in the Sun, and reduce to a kind of light Mo&s;s, almo&s;t powder'd, of a dark reddi&s;h Colour. This acquires a &s;trong di&s;agreeable &s;mell. They then wrap it up in Bladders for Tran&s;portation. And this is the Musk we u&s;e. There are a prodigious number of Animals that yield Musk, chiefly in the Kingdom of <HI>Boutan.</HI> They catch them u&s;ually at Spring-time, or in the be|ginning of Summer: For after they have been almo&s;t &s;tarv'd, during the Winter, becau&s;e of the Snows, that fall in tho&s;e Countries ten or twelve foot deep, they come to &s;eek for Food; their Blood being then in a great heat, and violent fermentation. The Musk then taken is likewi&s;e &s;trong and &s;pirituous, which is the rea&s;on they do not expo&s;e it for &s;ome time to dry in the Air, le&s;t it &s;hould quite de&s;troy the &s;mell. They cannot take a great deal of Musk from any one of the&s;e, Animals, becau&s;e they have but one Cod a piece, which does not yield above three Drams of Musk dry'd. They &s;ay, that the Bag, during the rutting of this Creature, has an Ab&s;ee&s;s form'd in it; which when fully ripe, it makes the Bea&s;t itch, and rub him&s;elf again&s;t Stones, Rocks, and Stumps of Trees, till he breaks it; and it is this Corruption, that when it is &s;pilt and dry'd in the Sun, becomes Musk. There is no impo&s;&s;ibility in this Story; but yet it is not to be thought, that all she Musk we have, is taken from the&s;e Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es. For,

<PB N="3" REF="10">is it likely, that they can follow the tract of the&s;e wild Bea&s;ts, through the Woods and Fore&s;ts, to gather up this matter; which they have thrown &s;ometimes into Places inacce&s;&s;ible, into Mire and Sands? If we had no other Musk but that, it would be much &s;carcer and dearer than it is.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 3. The SHAMOY, or ROCK-GOAT, is a wild Goat no bigger than the common Kind, which frequents the Rocks and high Hills; as the <HI>Alps, Py|renees,</HI> &amp;c. The Horns of this Animal are odly turn'd, for they ri&s;e upright fir&s;t, and then wind forward like a Hook: It feeds upon the Plants that grows on the Sands, and tops of the Rocks. 'Tis a very &s;hy and timorous Creature: It is coated like a Faun, having a &s;treak running all along the Back. There is a great Trade carried on with the&s;e <HI>Shamoy</HI> Skins; by which they convey Oil, Wine, and other Liquids, out of the mountainous Countries; and of which they make &s;everal other U&s;es: for the&s;e <HI>Shamoy</HI> Skins, be|ing dre&s;&s;ed, are converted into Gloves, Breeches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Becau&s;e they may be wa&s;hed as Linnen is, and likewi&s;e be dyed into what curious Colour you plea&s;e. Some|times in the Bladder of the&s;e Creatures is found a Stone, which is call'd <HI>German Bezoar,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Germans</HI> e|&s;teem this not inferior in Virtue to the Oriental <HI>Be|zoar.</HI> The volatile Salt and Oil, of which the&s;e Crea|tures, both Male and Female, afford abundance; are e&s;teem'd of very excellent U&s;e in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 4. The SHAGREEN is a Bea&s;t (as repre|&s;ented by Mr. <HI>Pomet</HI>) very much like an Hor&s;e or Mule; and is very common in <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> make u&s;e of to carry their Baggage, as in other parts they do Mules, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When this Animal is dead, they take the hinder part of his Skin, and hang it in the Air, after having &s;trew|ed it, when raw, with Mu&s;tard-Seed. They leave 'em thus expo&s;ed to the Weather &s;everal Days, then take them in and tan 'em; and when they are dre&s;&s;ed, export them. This Skin is very hard when dry, and &s;oft when &s;teep'd in Water. It is &s;aid, that what makes
<PB N="4" REF="11">this Skin &s;o hard, is becau&s;e the Animal &s;its down, and re&s;ts very much on his Buttocks. They bring two Sorts of Shagreen from <HI>Turkey, viz.</HI> the grey, or a&s;h-colour'd, which is the be&s;t; and the white, or &s;alted Shagreen. The U&s;e of this Shagreen is very univer&s;al for all &s;orts of Pocket Uten&s;ils, Watch Ca&s;es, Toys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They may dye the&s;e Skins what Colour they plea&s;e; but the mo&s;t common are black, green, and red. The mo&s;t beautiful and deare&s;t, is the red Co|lour, becau&s;e of the Vermilion and Carmine with which it is dyed. Shagreen Skin is often counter|feited in Work.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 5. The ANTELOPE is &s;hap'd very much like a Deer; and about the &s;ame bigne&s;s; of a che&s;nut Co|lour, and white under the Belly. His Horns are al|mo&s;t &s;traight from his Head up, tapering gradually, with Rings like a Screw, till within an Inch and an half of the top. It has fine large black Eyes; a long and &s;lender Neck, Feet, and Legs. There are many of the&s;e Creatures in an Herd; when at the &s;ame time they have Scouts, who by running give them Notice of an approaching Foe. They are taken by &s;hot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being too &s;wift for a Greyhound. The Antelope in &s;hape and beauty excels mo&s;t of the four-footed Race. This Creature is de&s;cribed in the <HI>Book of Three Hun|dred Animals;</HI> but the Figure there being very faulty, nothing like the Antelope; and having &s;ince an Op|portunity of a true Draught taken from the Creature it&s;elf; I hope giving it double will be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 6. The SEA-SKINK is a &s;mall amphi|bious Animal, living both on Land, and in Wa|ter. It is pretty much like a &s;mall Lizard. Many of the&s;e little Creatures are to be found about the Ri|ver <HI>Nile</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> They are about half a Foot long, and an Inch diameter, having a &s;harp No&s;e, cover'd with Scales. It has two little piercing Eyes. The Mouth is divided, reaching to the place where the Ears &s;hould be &s;eated, had this Creature any. It has a great many little white and red Teeth: It goes upon four Feet, little more than an Inch long, which

It is of a greyi&s;h Colour, inclining to brown upon the Back, and of a &s;ilver grey under the Belly. The Fle&s;h of this Crea|ture is u&s;ed in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 7. The MAN-TIGER is bred in <HI>Africa;</HI> &amp;c. It is of the bigne&s;s of a large Ape or Baboon; of a brown Colour on the Back and Sides; the Belly, Neck, and Throat, of a whiti&s;h Colour; the But|tocks and Face of a light blue: It has a bunch of Hair &s;tanding up on the top of the Head; and ano|ther, re&s;embling a Beard, hanging under the Chin: The Vent of this Animal is placed very high on the hinder part of its Back. It is a Bea&s;t that parti|cipates much of the &s;ubtle and mi&s;chievous Na|ture of Apes and Baboons; but much more bold and fierce. Some Writers have confidently a&s;&s;erted, that &s;ome of the&s;e Creatures have had the boldne&s;s to attack the Cha&s;tity of Women. Mr. <HI>Bradley</HI> men|tions one &s;ort of Ape brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> that is very vicious; and he knew one that had more than once attempted to force a Servant of the Hou&s;e where he was kept. The <HI>Man-Tiger</HI> is thought to approach the neare&s;t the Human Species, both in Form and Sen&s;e, of all the Brute Creation.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 8. Is a MAN-TIGER brought from <HI>Africa;</HI> which differs &s;omething from the former. It is co|pied from the Figure Mr. <HI>Bradley</HI> exhibits, in the <HI>Works of Nature. Fig.</HI> 7. is from a Painting by a good Hand, from the Creature it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15"><HI>Fig.</HI> 9. This little Creature is found at <HI>Surinam.

It is of a yellowi&s;h brown Colour, but its under part is of a whiti&s;h Colour. When &s;he goes out to &s;eek for Food, her young Ones run about her; which, when they are full, or in danger, or for wearine&s;s, immediately mount upon their Mother's Back, and twi&s;t their Tails round the Tail of the old one, who forthwith carries them into her Hole.</P>

Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail, was fourteen Inches; breadth, when the Wings were expanded, twenty one Inches; its weight nine Ounces: Its Bill was three Inches long, &s;lender, black, flat or depre&s;&s;ed, reflected up|wards, which is peculiar to this Bird, ending in a very thin, &s;lender, weak point; the Tongue is &s;hort, not cloven; the Head of a mean &s;ize, round like a Ball, and black above the Eyes; the Colour of the whole under Side of the Body was white, and the upper &s;ide partly white and partly black, or dark brown; its Legs are very long, of a lovely blue Co|lour, bare above the Knees, and the Claws black and little; it hath a back Toe, but a very &s;mall one. Mr. <HI>Albin</HI> &s;ays, he had this Bird from <HI>Newgate-Market;</HI> it was brought to that Place with other Wild-fowl.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="19"><HI>Fig.</HI> 2. The BEARD-MANICA, or BEARDED-TITMOUSE, is in length from the tip of the Bill, to the end of the Tail, about &s;ix Inches and an half; in breadth, when the Wings are extended, ten Inches and a half; in weight nine Drams and a half: The Bill is &s;hort, thick, and of a yellowi&s;h Colour, (in the Hen dusky.) The Head is of a dark a&s;h Colour; from the Eyes a Tuft of black Feathers hangs down, end|ing in a point, repre&s;enting a picked Beard, from which Mark it has the Name of <HI>Beard-manica.</HI> The Back, upper part of the Wings, and lower part of the Belly, and Tail, are brown; under the Chin white; the Brea&s;t, Belly, and Thighs, of a pale yellowi&s;h white, with a tincture of brown; the Legs and Feet black. This Bird is very &s;ingular in the care and love which he &s;hews to the Hen; when at Roo&s;t, he covers her all Night with his Wing. The Hen is &s;omething &s;mal|ler than the Cock, and of a more beautiful yel|lowi&s;h brown; the Wings and Legs of the &s;ame Co|lour with tho&s;e of the Cock: The Hen is without the Beard, and more pale on the Brea&s;t.&mdash;They are found in the Salt-Mar&s;hes in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and likewi&s;e in the Fens in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>

The JACOBINE-PIGEON, or as it is vul|garly call'd for &s;hortne&s;s, the JACK, is, if true, the &s;malle&s;t of all Pigeons, and the &s;maller &s;till the better: It has a range of Feathers inverted quite over the hin|der part of the Head, and reaching down on each &s;ide of the Neck to the Shoulders of the Wings, which forms a kind of a Fryar's Hood: From hence this Pi|geon has its name <HI>Jacobine,</HI> becau&s;e the Fathers of that Order all wear Hoods to cover their bald crowns; hence the upper part of this range of Feathers is call'd the Hood: and the more compact the&s;e Feathers are, and the clo&s;er to the Head, &s;o much the more this Bird is e&s;teem'd.

As for their Colour, there are reds, yellows, blues, blacks, and mottles; but be the Colour of the Feathers what they will, they ought to have a clean white Head, white Feet, and white Tail. Of the&s;e Pigeons, &s;ome are fea|ther-legg'd and footed, others are not, and both &s;orts are equally e&s;teem'd, according to the various Incli|nation of different Fancies.</P>
<P><HI>Fig.</HI> 4. The FRIGAT Bird, which the <HI>Indians</HI> call &s;o, becau&s;e of the &s;wiftne&s;s of its flight; has a Body no bigger than a Pullet's, but its Stomach is ve|ry fle&s;hy: The Males are as black as Ravens. The Neck is pretty long, the Head &s;mall, with two great black Eyes, and the Sight more piercing than the Eagle's; The Bill is likewi&s;e pretty thick, and entire|ly black, about &s;ix or &s;even Inches long; the upper Beak is crook'd like a Hook: The Claws are very &s;hort, and divided as the Vulture's. The Wings of this Bird are very large, and not without a provident de&s;ign of Nature, &s;ince his Wings are &s;ometimes em|ploy'd to carry him above a hundred Leagues from Land. It is with a great deal of Trouble, that this Bird can rai&s;e him&s;elf upon the Branches, becau&s;e of the extraordinary length of his Wings; but when he has once taken his flight, he keeps his Wings ex|tended almo&s;t without any Motion or Fatigue. If &s;ometimes the weight of the Rain, or the violence of the Winds, force him, he mounts above the Clouds, beyond Sight, in the middle Region of the Air; and when he is at the highe&s;t, he does not forget where-about he is, but remembers the place where the <HI>Do|rado,</HI> or gold Fi&s;h, gives chace to the flying Fi&s;h, and then he throws him&s;elf down like Lightning; not &s;o as to &s;trike upon the Water, for then it would be difficult for him to ri&s;e again; but when he comes within twelve or fourteen Paces, he makes a large turn, and lowering him&s;elf, as it were in&s;en&s;ibly, till he comes to skim the Waters where the Chace is given; in pa&s;&s;ing, he takes up the little Fi&s;h, either with his Bill, or his Talons, and &s;ometimes both to|gether.
<PB N="10" REF="23">He has a great red Comb, like that of the Cock, not upon his Head, but under the Throat; and this Comb does not appear but in the old ones; The Females have none; the Feathers are whiter than tho&s;e of the Males, e&s;pecially under the Belly. The&s;e Birds, for a long time, made a little I&s;land their Ha|bitation; in like manner, as the Rooks have a Rooke|ry, where all of that Species thereabout, come to roo&s;t at Nights, and build their Ne&s;t in the proper Sea|&s;on. This little I&s;land was called the <HI>I&s;le of Frigats,</HI> and bears the Name to this Day, tho' the Birds have left the Place; for in the Year 1643, and the follow|ing Year, &s;everal People chas'd them &s;o &s;everely, that they were forc'd to for&s;ake the I&s;le.

They &s;urpriz'd the old ones upon the Branches of the Trees, or in the Ne&s;ts; and as they ri&s;e with a great deal of Difficulty to take Wing, it was an ea&s;y matter to beat them down with long Sticks.

It is two Years before this Bird arrives to its perfect Co|lour; at which time it is entirely red, except the prime Feathers of the Wings, which are black when it is at its full bigne&s;s: its weight is about two Pounds and a half; its Legs are long, and of a red Colour, bare of Feathers a good way above the Knees; the Toes webb'd together; the Claws black. The&s;e Birds make their Ne&s;ts on Hillocks, in &s;hallow Wa|ter, on which they &s;it with their Legs extended down|wards. They breed on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cuba</HI> and the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, and frequent the &s;alt Water; a Man by concealing him&s;elf from their &s;ight, may kill great Numbers of them, for they will not ri&s;e at the Report of a Gun; neither is the &s;ight of tho&s;e killed clo&s;e by them, &s;ufficient to terrify the re&s;t, and warn them of

When they feed (which is always in &s;hallow Water) by bending their Neck, they lay the upper part of their Bill next the Ground, their Feet being in conti|nual Motion up and down in the Mud; by which they rai&s;e a &s;mall round &s;ort of Seed or Grain, re&s;em|bling Millet, which they receive into their Bill; and as there is a nece&s;&s;ity of admitting into their Mouths &s;ome Mud, Nature has provided the edges of their Bill with fine Teeth like tho&s;e of a Comb, with which they retain the Food, and reject the Mud that is taken in with it.

The outer edges all round the Cre&s;t was black; the lower part of the Cre&s;t next the Head, and part of the Neck, was of a lead Colour; all the re&s;t of the Bird, a fine red, only the Wings and Tail &s;omewhat darker than the Body; and the Legs and Feet black.</P>

The GANSER may be cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e of the Goo&s;e-kind, the Bill and Feet being like theirs; the top and back part of the Head, Brea&s;t, Belly, and Thighs were of a pale yellowi&s;h buff-colour, with a light tincture of reddi&s;h brown, here and there in Spots, excepting a large Spot of reddi&s;h brown on the middle of the Brea&s;t: The Bill was red, flat, and toothed like that of the Goo&s;e: The fore-part of the Head round the Eyes reddi&s;h brown, with a ring of the &s;ame Colour round the upper part of the Neck,

It was web-footed, its Legs very long, and bare above Knee, both Legs and Feet of a red Colour. Its Food was the &s;ame with that of Gee&s;e, eating Gra&s;s and Corn. The Difference be|tween the Cock and Hen could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed, either by the Colours or Shape, but only by the Cock's running to the Hen with open Wings, cla&s;ping or embracing her round with them.</P>

The LONG-TAIL HUMMING-BIRD is the lea&s;t of all the Species of this Kind of Birds, of which Naturali&s;ts reckon nine different &s;orts, and the lea&s;t that we know of found upon our Globe. Its length from the beginning of the Head, or In&s;ertion of the Bill, to the ri&s;e of the Tail, is two Inches and a half; that is, the Neck one Inch, and the Body an Inch and a half long: the Head &s;mall; the Bill a little more than an Inch long, black, round, &s;harp and almo&s;t &s;traight. The Legs and Feet like tho&s;e of the re&s;t; the Feathers al&s;o of the Body and Wings are alike di&s;po&s;ed, but differently coloured: It hath a Tail lon|ger than any of the re&s;t, &s;omewhat more than three Inches, con&s;i&s;ting of Feathers, of which that which is nearer to its ri&s;e is &s;horter, the &s;econd always longer. The Tail is forked, and the Bird in flying &s;preads it
<PB N="20" REF="43">into two large Horns, &s;o that the tips of the Horns are an Inch and an half di&s;tant from each other. The whole Head and Neck of this Bird is of a &s;hining &s;ilken black Colour, inclining to or interchanging with blue, as in the Necks of Mallards; the whole Back and Brea&s;t are green, &s;hining interchangeably with golden and &s;ea-green, as in the &s;econd kind of the&s;e Birds. The Wings are of a liver-colour; the Tail of of a blacki&s;h blue, &s;hining like poli&s;hed Steel blued over. There are &s;o great a variety of beautiful Co|lours, in the Feathers of all the Kinds of the&s;e Birds; and &s;o wonderfully re&s;plendent, that they cannot be well repre&s;ented by any Painter: The <HI>Indians</HI> make of the&s;e Feathers the Repre&s;entations of Saints, and other things, &s;o dextrou&s;ly and artificially, to the Life, that one would think they were drawn with a Pencil in Colours.

They par|take of the Bird kind in having only two Legs, be&s;ides the Hooks at the pinions of their Wings; they have al&s;o the Power of flying.

<PB N="54" REF="111">the other. <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was the only Place which the <HI>Euro|peans</HI> frequented, for the &s;ake of their Silk: and it is certain that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> took care, for many hundred Years, to keep their Silk-Manufactures to them&s;elves, not permitting the <HI>Silk-Worms</HI> to be carried out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or any Per&s;ons to pa&s;s from thence into the We&s;t, who were skilled in managing them. <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> looking on it as a great Hard&s;hip, that the Subjects of his Empire &s;hould buy this Manufacture of the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> at &s;o dear a Rate, in order to put an end to this Impo&s;ition, &s;ent two Monks into <HI>India,</HI> (under|&s;tanding that there was plenty of Silk in tho&s;e Parts) to learn there how the &s;ilken Trade was managed; and on their Return to bring with them (if it was po&s;&s;ible to be procured) &s;ome of the Species, whether Vege|table or Animal, from which the Silk was produced; that &s;o he might &s;et up the Manufacture in his own Dominions. The&s;e Monks, when they returned, told the Emperor, That the Silk was produced by a living Creature, a Worm, which could not be brought &s;o long a Journey alive. But under&s;tanding from them that its Eggs might be brought; from which the Creatures might be propagated; He &s;ent them back a &s;econd time, to bring him of tho&s;e Eggs: Who hav|ing effected what they went about, brought to <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> great Quantities, which they pre&s;ented to the Emperor in great State on Hor&s;eback, (accom|pany'd by many of his Nobles, Senators and Magi&s;|trates) enclos'd in a Roll or Horn of Paper, with In|&s;tructions how to breed, nouri&s;h, and draw Silk from the &s;aid Creatures: which was received with great Applau&s;e and Admiration; and from tho&s;e Eggs have been propagated all the <HI>Silk-Worms,</HI> and their Silk in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

When the Worms have fed their full time, and are ready to &s;pin their Silk, roll up white Paper like a Wafer, the&s;e pin up again&s;t the Hangings of a Room, or to Lines tied cro&s;s the Room; in the&s;e Papers put every &s;ingle Worm, as you perceive it wants to &s;pin, which it will begin to do generally as &s;oon as it is put into the Paper. When the Worm has fini&s;hed its Ca&s;e, and changed into an <HI>Aurelia,</HI> which is known by hearing it rattle, when it is &s;haken at the Ear. Then proceed to wind off the Silk, never &s;uffering the Moth-Fly to eat its way out of the Ca&s;e, not even of tho&s;e that are de&s;igned to
<PB N="56" REF="113">propagate Seed for the next Year. A Gentleman very curious in his Ob&s;ervations and Experiments upon the <HI>Silk-Worm,</HI> his Method in winding off the Silk is, as &s;oon as the Worms have fini&s;hed their Bottoms, and changed into <HI>Aurelias,</HI> to put the Bottoms into warm Water, with &s;ome Spirit of Wine in it, which he &s;ays facilitates the winding off the Silk very much; the Ends he finds more readily, and winds them on a Card in his Hand, without any Reel or Machine at all: And as the Silk-Bottoms are wound off, he takes the <HI>Aurelia</HI> of each, and places them in one of tho&s;e clean Paper-Pans, erect upon the piqued end; and when its time is accompli&s;hed, to enter upon its la&s;t Transformation of a Moth-Fly, it will a&s;&s;ume its new State, as well as if it had continued the whole time in its Silk-Ca&s;e; and this Method is practi&s;ed by divers other Per&s;ons, who wind off the Silk after the &s;ame manner. When the Silk-Moths are come out of their Ca&s;es, being per|fectly transformed, and are put into &s;uch Paper Drip|ping-Pans, or Troughs, as they are bred in, there they will couple and lay their Eggs: When that is over, the Papers with the Eggs upon them (never attempt to take the Eggs off) are to be put into a Che&s;t or Trunk one upon another, among wollen Cloths; and without any other Art or Means, there let them re|main till the next Spring. Some Ladies who keep <HI>Silk-Worms,</HI> be&s;ides the Plea&s;ure they take in feeding and ob&s;erving the&s;e wonderful Creatures, make u&s;e of the Silk-Ca&s;e, which they cut (after the outer Sleave or Down is off) into artificial Flowers to wear in their Heads, which they them&s;elves paint and colour, to imitate Nature.</P>

I have beheld them in&s;tructing their young ones how to hunt, which they would &s;ometimes di&s;cipline for not well ob&s;erving; but when any of the old ones did mi&s;s a Leap, they would run out of the Field, and hide them&s;elves in their Crannies, as a&s;ham'd, and not be &s;een abroad for four or five Hours after: for &s;o long have I watched the Nature of of this &s;trange In&s;ect, the Contemplation of who&s;e &s;o wonderful Sagacity and Addre&s;s has amaz'd me; nor do I find in any Cha&s;e what&s;oever, more Cunning and Stratagem ob&s;erv'd. I have found &s;ome of the&s;e Spiders in my Gar|den, when the Weather towards the Spring is very hot, but they are nothing &s;o eager of Hunting as they are in <HI>Italy.</HI></Q></P>

The <HI>Carter,</HI> or <HI>Long-legg'd Spider,</HI> for two Particularities has very few Creatures like it; the fir&s;t, which is di&s;coverable only by the Micro&s;cope, is the curious Contrivance of his Eyes, of which he has only two, and tho&s;e placed upon the top of a &s;mall Pillar or Hillock, ri&s;ing out of the middle of the top of its Back, or rather the Crown of its Head; for they were fixed on the very top of this Pillar, placed back to back, with the tran&s;parent Parts, or Pupils, look|ing towards either &s;ide, but &s;omewhat more forward than backwards. The&s;e Eyes, to appearance, &s;eem'd to be of the very &s;ame Structure with that of larger two-ey'd Creatures, &s;eeming to have a very &s;mooth and very protuberant Cornea, and in the mid&s;t of it to have a very black Puple, incompa&s;&s;ed about with a kind of grey <HI>Iris.</HI> Whether it were able to move the&s;e Eyes to and fro, I have not ob&s;erv'd; but 'tis not very likely he &s;hould, the Pillar or Neck &s;eeming
<PB N="68" REF="134">to be cover'd and &s;tiffen'd with a cru&s;ty Shell; but Nature, in all probability, has &s;upply'd that Defect, by making the Cornea &s;o very protuberant, and &s;etting it &s;o clear above the &s;hadowing or ob&s;tructing of its Pro&s;pect by the Body, that 'tis likely each Eye may perceive, though not &s;ee di&s;tinctly, almo&s;t an Hemi|&s;phere; whence having &s;o &s;mall and round a Body, placed upon &s;uch long Legs, it is quickly able &s;o to wind, and turn it, as to &s;ee any thing di&s;tinct. This Creature, as do all other <HI>Spiders,</HI> differs very much from mo&s;t In&s;ects in the Figure of its Eyes; for the be&s;t Micro&s;cope does not di&s;cover its Eyes to be any ways knobb'd or pearl'd, like tho&s;e of other Infects. The &s;econd Peculiarity which is obvious to the Eye, is al&s;o very remarkable, and that is the prodigious length of its Legs, in proportion to its &s;mall round Body, and which are jointed, ju&s;t like tho&s;e of a Crab, but every of the Parts are &s;pun out prodigiou&s;ly lon|ger in proportion; each of the&s;e Legs are terminated in a &s;mall Ca&s;e or Shell, &s;hap'd almo&s;t like that of a Mu&s;cle-&s;hell, fa&s;ten'd to the Body in &s;o ad|mirable a manner, as does not a little manife&s;t the Wi&s;dom of Nature in the Contrivance; for the&s;e long Leavers (as I may &s;o call them) of the Legs, having not the advantage of a long end on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Hypomochlion,</HI> or Centers, on which part of the Legs move, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require a va&s;t Strength to move them, and keep the Body balanc'd and &s;u&s;|pended, in&s;omuch, that if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a Man's Body &s;u&s;pended by &s;uch a Contrivance, an hundred and fifty times the &s;trength of a Man would not keep the Body from falling on the Brea&s;t. To &s;upply there|fore each of the&s;e Legs with its proper &s;trength, Na|ture has allow'd to each a large Che&s;t or Cell, in
<PB N="69" REF="135">which is included a very large and &s;trong Mu&s;cle; and thereby this little Animal is not only able to &s;u&s;|pend its Body upon le&s;s than the&s;e eight, but to move it very &s;wiftly over the tops of Gra&s;s and Leaves. This Creature &s;eems to throw its Body upon the Prey, not unlike a Jumping-Spider. The whole Fa|brick, when view'd by the Micro&s;cope, appear'd a very pretty one; and could it have been di&s;&s;ected, as many Singularities might have been found within it as without; perhaps, for the mo&s;t part, not unlike the Parts of a Crab, which this little Creature does in many things very much re&s;emble. I omit the De|&s;cription of the Horns, of the Mouth which &s;eem'd like that of a Crabs; the Speckledne&s;s of his Shell, which proceeded from a kind of Feathers, or Hairs, and the hairine&s;s of his Legs, his large Thorax and little Belly, and the like, and &s;hall only take notice, that the three Parts of the Body, namely the Head, Brea&s;t and Belly, are in this Creature &s;trangely confus'd, &s;o that 'tis difficult to determine which is which, as they are al&s;o in a Crab; and indeed, this &s;eems to be nothing el&s;e but an <HI>Air-Crab,</HI> being made more light and nimble, proportionable to the Medium wherein it re&s;ides; and as Air &s;eems to have but one thou&s;andth part of the Body of Water, &s;o does this Spider &s;eem not to be a thou&s;andth part of the Bulk of a Crab.</P>
<P>All kinds of <HI>Spiders</HI> &s;eem to be Creatures of Prey, and to feed on other &s;mall Infects; but their ways of catching them are very different: The <HI>Shepherd Spi|der</HI> by running on his Prey; the <HI>Jumping Spider</HI> by leaping on it, other &s;orts weave Nets, or Cobwebs, whereby they in&s;nare them; Nature having both fit|ted them with Materials and Tools, and taught them
<PB N="70" REF="136">how to work and weave their Nets, and lie perdue, and to watch diligently to run on a Fly as &s;oon as en|tangled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Foot of a Spider</HI> is of an admirable and won|derful Mechani&s;m, whereby he is able to &s;pin, weave, and climb, or run on his curious tran&s;parent Clue.

<PB N="71" REF="138">a hundred or more; and the&s;e are hatched partly by the Heat of the Mother, partly by that of the Sun, in about twenty or thirty Days time. In the Summer Months, e&s;pecially when the Heats are greate&s;t, as in the Dog-days, the <HI>Tarantula</HI> creeping among the Corn in the Fields, bites the Mowers and Pa&s;&s;engers. In the Winter it lurks in Holes, and is &s;carcely &s;een; and if it does bite then, it is not veno|mous, neither does it induce any ill Symptoms. But in the hot Weather, altho' the Pain of its Bite is at fir&s;t no greater than what is cau&s;ed by the Sting of a Bee, yet the Part quickly after is di&s;coloured with a livid, black, or yellowi&s;h Circle, and rai&s;ed to an inflam'd Swelling; the Patient within a few Hours is &s;eized with a violent Sickne&s;s, Difficulty of Breath|ing, univer&s;al Faintne&s;s, and &s;ometimes Trembling, with a Weakne&s;s of the Head; being asked what the Ail is, makes no Reply, or with a querulous Voice and melancholy Look, points to his Brea&s;t, as if the Heart was mo&s;t affected.</P>
<P>During this mournful Scene, all the u&s;ual Medicines apply'd to venomous Bites, and Cordials, are of no &s;ervice; for, notwith&s;tanding their repeated u&s;e, the Patient growing by degrees more melancholy, &s;tupid, and &s;trangely timorous, in a &s;hort time expires; unle&s;s Mu&s;ick be called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which alone, with|out the help of Medicine, performs the Cure. For, at the fir&s;t Sound of the Mu&s;ical In&s;trument, altho' the Sick lie, as it were, in an Apoplectick Fit, they begin by degrees to move their Hands and Feet, till at la&s;t they get up, and fall to dancing with won|derful Vigour, at fir&s;t for three or four Hours; then they are put to Bed, refre&s;hed from their Sweating, for a &s;hort time, and repeat the Exerci&s;e with the
<PB N="72" REF="139">&s;ame Vehemence, perceiving no Wearine&s;s or Weak|ne&s;s from it, but profe&s;&s;ing they grow &s;tronger and nimbler the more they dance.</P>
<P>At this &s;port they u&s;ually &s;pend twelve Hours a Day, and it continues three or four Days; by which time they are generally freed from all their Symp|toms, which do neverthele&s;s attack 'em again about the &s;ame time the next Year; and if they do not take care to prevent this Relap&s;e by Mu&s;ick, they fall into a Jaundice, want of Appetite, univer&s;al Weakne&s;s, and &s;uch like Di&s;ea&s;es; which are every Year increa&s;|ed, if Dancing be neglected, till at la&s;t they prove incurable. As Mu&s;ick is the common Cure, &s;o they who are bitten are pleas'd, &s;ome with one &s;ort of it, &s;ome with another; one is rais'd with a Pipe, ano|ther with a Timbrel; one with a Harp, another with a Fiddle; &s;o that the Mu&s;icians make &s;ometimes &s;eve|ral E&s;&s;ays before they can accommodate their Art to the Venom; but this is con&s;tant and certain, notwith|&s;tanding this Variety, that they all require the quick|e&s;t and briske&s;t Tunes, and are never moved by a &s;low, dull Harmony.</P>
<P>While the Per&s;ons affected are Dancing, they lo&s;e in a manner the u&s;e of all their Sen&s;es; like &s;o many Drunkards, do many ridiculous and fooli&s;h Tricks; talk and act ob&s;cenely and rudely; take great Plea|&s;ure in playing with Vine-Leaves, with naked Swords, and red Cloths, and the like; and on the other hand can't bear the &s;ight of any thing black; &s;o that if any By-&s;tander happen to appear in that Colour, he mu&s;t immediately withdraw, or otherwi&s;e they Re|lap&s;e into their Symptoms with as much Violence as ever.</P>

The <HI>Ant, &s;ays he,</HI> is of a dark brown, or reddi&s;h Colour, with long Legs, on the hinder of which it would &s;tand up, and rai&s;e its Head as high as it could above the Ground, that it might &s;tare the further about it, ju&s;t after the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Hunting-Spider</HI> is ob|&s;erv'd to do: and putting my Finger towards them,
<PB N="74" REF="142">they have at fir&s;t all run towards it, till almo&s;t at it; and then they would &s;tand round about it, at a cer|tain di&s;tance, and &s;mell, as it were, and con&s;ider whether they &s;hould any of them venture any fur|ther; till one more bold than the re&s;t venturing to climb it, all the re&s;t, if I would have &s;uffered them, would have immediately followed: Many &s;uch other &s;eemingly rational Actions I have ob&s;erv'd in this little Vermin, with much Plea&s;ure. I have ob&s;erv'd a very large Kind, that inhabited under the Roots of a Tree, from whence they would &s;ally out in great Parties, and make mo&s;t grievous Havock of the Flowers and Fruits, in the ambient Garden, and re|turn back again very expertly, by the &s;ame Ways and Paths they went. It has a large Head, at the upper end of which were two protuberant Eyes, pear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d like tho&s;e of a Fly, but &s;maller: Out of the No&s;e, or foremo&s;t Part, i&s;&s;ued two Horns, differing from tho&s;e of a blue Fly, though indeed they &s;eem to be both the &s;ame kind of Organ, and to &s;erve for a kind of Smelling: Beyond the&s;e were two indented Jaws, which he open'd &s;ideways, and was able to gape them a&s;under very wide; and the ends of them being arm|ed with Teeth, which meeting went between each other, it was able to gra&s;p and hold an heavy Body, three or four times the Bulk and Weight of its own Body. It has only &s;ix Legs, &s;hap'd like tho&s;e of a Fly, which is an Argument that it is a winged In|fect; and though I could not perceive any &s;ign of them in the middle part of its Body, which &s;eem'd to con&s;i&s;t of three Joints or Pieces; yet 'tis known that there are of them that have long Wings, and fly up and down in the Air. The whole Body was cas'd over with a very &s;trong Armour, and the Bel|ly
<PB N="75" REF="143">was covered likewi&s;e with Multitudes of &s;mall white &s;hining Bri&s;tles; the Legs, Horns, Head, and middle Parts of its Body were be&s;tuck with Hairs al&s;o, but &s;maller and darker. In <HI>America,</HI> as <HI>Merian</HI> writes, there are very large <HI>Ants</HI> or <HI>Pi&s;mires,</HI> which will in one Night &s;trip whole Trees of their Leaves. They have two crooked Teeth, cutting one upon another, like a Pair of Pincers; by means of the&s;e, they cut the Leaves of the Trees &s;o that they fall to the Ground, and the Tree looks bare and naked; ju&s;t as it looks in the Winter in <HI>Europe:</HI> Thou&s;ands of <HI>Ants</HI> wai&s;ing for this Booty, catch up the Leaf as it falls on the Earth, to carry to their Homes; not &s;o much for their own Food as their young ones, as yet but little Worms. This whole Proceeding &s;eems, as if it were, done by a mutual Agreement among&s;t them&s;elves; that one Party &s;hould go up in the Tree to cut the Leaves, whil&s;t the other bears an equal &s;hare of the Labour in carrying them to their Cells. The&s;e <HI>Ants,</HI> when they are arriv'd to their full Growth, &s;hed their Coats, or Skins, in like manner as do &s;ome other of the In&s;ect Kind; and become winged: In this &s;tate they lay their Eggs ju&s;t as the Gnats do; which are afterwards hatch'd into little Worms, or Mites; and for the Pre&s;ervation of this their Offspring it is, that the provident <HI>Ants</HI> are &s;o eager and vigilant to feed and nouri&s;h them: So great is their Concern in this particular, as appears by their indefatigable Toil, that they may very ju&s;t|ly be e&s;teem'd as great Patterns of Tenderne&s;s and Care of their Young, as they are for Indu&s;try and good Economy. The&s;e indu&s;trious little Creatures make Caverns in the Earth of a great Depth, &s;o ar|tificially contriv'd, that one would affirm it to be a

It is a Creature active and nimble, &s;o as there are very few Creatures like it, whether bigger or &s;maller, in&s;omuch that it will &s;cape and avoid a &s;mall Body, tho' coming on it exceeding &s;wiftly; and if it &s;ees any thing approaching it which it fears, it pre&s;ently &s;quats down, as it were, that it may be the more ready for its ri&s;e. Nor is it le&s;s hardy in the Winter, than active in the Summer, en|during all the Fro&s;ts, and &s;urviving till the next Sum|mer, notwith&s;tanding the bitter cold of our Climate. One of the&s;e put in Spirit of Wine, was very quick|ly &s;eemingly kill'd, and both its Eyes and Mouth be|gan to look very red; but upon the taking it out, and &s;uffering it to lie three or four Hours, and heat|ing it with the Sun beams ca&s;t through a Burning|gla&s;s, it again reviv'd, &s;eeming, as it were, to have been all the intermediate time dead Drunk, and af|ter certain Hours to grow fre&s;h again and &s;ober. The Eyes of a Fly are placed in two Clu&s;ters; and

As among greater Animals there are many that are &s;caled, both for Ornament and Defence, &s;o are there not wanting &s;uch al&s;o among the le&s;&s;er Bodies of In&s;ects, whereof this little Crea|ture gives us an In&s;tance. It is a &s;mall white &s;ilver|&s;hining Worm or Moth, found much conver&s;ant among Books and Papers; and is &s;uppos'd to be that which corrodes and eats Holes through the Leaves and Covers: It appears to the naked Eya, a &s;mall glittering Pearl-colour'd Moth, which upon the re|moving of Books and Papers in the Summer, is of|ten ob&s;erv'd to &s;cud, and pack away to &s;ome lurking Cranney, where it may the better protect it&s;elf from any appearing Dangers. Its Head appears big and blunt, and its Body tapers from it towards the Tail, &s;maller and &s;maller, being &s;hap'd almo&s;t like a Car|rot. The Body is divided into fourteen &s;everal Par|titions, being the appearance of &s;o many &s;everal Shells, or Shields that cover the whole Body; every of the&s;e Shells are again covered or tiled over with a multi|tude of thin tran&s;parent Scales, which, from the multiplicity of their reflecting Surfaces, make the whole Animal appear of a perfect Pearl-colour. This In&s;ect was furni&s;h'd on either &s;ide of its Head with a Clu&s;ter of Eyes; and each of the&s;e Clu&s;ters were be&s;et with a row of &s;mall Bri&s;tles, much like the <HI>Ci|lia</HI> or Hairs on the Eye-lids; and, perhaps, they &s;erv'd for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. It had two long Horns; curiou&s;ly ring'd or knobb'd, having at each knob &s;mall Hairs, or Bri&s;tles, here and there di&s;pers'd among them: be&s;ides the&s;e, it had two &s;horter
<PB N="80" REF="150">Horns, or Feelers, which were knotted and fring'd, ju&s;t as the former. It had three Tails, in every par|ticular re&s;embling the two longer Horns that grow out of the Head. The Legs of it were &s;cal'd and hair'd ju&s;t like the re&s;t, but are not expre&s;s'd in this Figure, the Creature being intangled all in Glue, and &s;o the Legs of this appear'd not through the Gla&s;s, which looked perpendicularly upon the Back. The Body is be&s;et with &s;harp-pointed Bri&s;tles, like Spears. Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;ays, This Animal probably &s;eeds upon the Paper and Covers of Books, and perforates in them &s;everal &s;mall round Holes. Mr. <HI>Albin</HI> calls it the <HI>Cloth Worm,</HI> or Moth, and &s;ays it is the very Creature that eats the woollen Cloth; and that it is produced from a &s;mall grey &s;peckled Moth that flies a-nights, and creeps in among woollen Cloths, and there lays her Eggs, which are hatch'd in their Sea|&s;on by the natural Heat of the Woollen; upon which the&s;e little Creatures feed, till they change into a fly|ing In&s;ect like their Animal Parent. To prevent the Havock that this little Creature (which is one of the Teeth of Time) is wont to make among woollen Cloths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They &s;hould &s;ometimes be air'd and bru&s;h'd, before the warm Sea&s;on comes on for the Eggs to hatch, which will ab&s;olutely de&s;troy the Eggs, and pre&s;erve the Garments.</P>

Its natural bigne&s;s was about the &s;ize of a large Mite, or &s;omewhat longer; it had ten Legs, eight of which were topt with very &s;harp Claws, and were tho&s;e upon which he walk'd, &s;eeming &s;hap'd much like tho&s;e of a Crab, which in many other things al&s;o this little Creature re&s;embled; for the two other Claws, which were the foremo&s;t of all the ten, were exactly form'd in the manner of Crabs or Lob&s;ters Claws; which this little Animal did open and &s;hut at plea&s;ure: It &s;eem'd to make u&s;e of tho&s;e two Claws both for Feelers and Hold|ers; for in its motion it carried the&s;e aloft extended before, moving them to and fro, ju&s;t as a man blind|folded would do his Hands, when he is fearful of running again&s;t a Wall; and if I put an Hair to it, it would readily take hold of it with the&s;e Claws, and &s;eem to hold it fa&s;t.

I could not certainly find, whe|ther it had under the&s;e la&s;t Shells any Wings, but I &s;u&s;pect the contrary; for I have not found any wing'd Infect with eight Legs, two of tho&s;e Legs being

<P>_COFFEE is the Fruit of a Tree which grows in <HI>Arabia Fleix,</HI> and is brough to us from <HI>Mocha.</HI> The Flower of this Tree is like the white Je&s;famine Flower, and the Leaf like the Bay-leaf: The <HI>Coffee</HI> Tree is propagated by Seeds, which &s;hou'd be &s;own &s;oon af|ter they are gather'd from the Tree; for if they are kept but a &s;hort time out of the Ground, they will not grow; which is the chief Rea&s;on that this Tree has not been &s;pread into more different Countries: for the Seeds will not keep good long enough to be &s;ent to any di&s;tant Place: So that in order to culti|vate this Plant in any Part of the World, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to have it carried thither growing. But as this Difficulty is now overcome, by the quan|tity
<PB N="86" REF="160">of the&s;e Trees there are now growing both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> &s;o we may expect to be furni&s;h|ed with them from many different Parts, but e&s;pe|cially from the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands, where the Trees are found to &s;ucceed as well as in their native Soil; but whether the <HI>Coffee</HI> produced in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> will prove as good as that brought from <HI>Mocha,</HI> Time will di&s;cover. The Berries of this Plant are commonly ripe with us in <HI>April. Coffee</HI> is of an excellent dry|ing Quality; it comforts the Brain, ea&s;es Pains of the Head, &s;uppre&s;&s;es Vapours, dries up Crudities in the Stomach; prevents Sleepine&s;s after eating, and gives Life and Gaiety to the Spritis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>TEA is the Leaf of a &s;mall Shrub, which grows plentifully in &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> It is brought over dry'd from <HI>China, Japan,</HI> and <HI>Siam.</HI> The&s;e Leaves they gather in the Spring, at which time they are little and tender, and of the &s;hape of the Figure in the Plate. It bears a Flower compo&s;ed of five white Leaves, form'd like a Ro&s;e, and &s;ome <HI>Stamina;</HI> which, when gone, is &s;ucceeded by a thick Cod, like a Hazel-nut, of a Che&s;nut-colour, in which is found two or three Nuts or Berries, which con|tain in each a little lu&s;cious Almond, of an ill Ta&s;te. The Root is fibrous, and &s;preads upon the Surface of the Earth. This Shrub flouri&s;hes equally in rich or poor Ground. The <HI>Tea</HI> which the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. bring over in curl'd or twi&s;ted Leaves, is thus prepar'd by the Natives of the Country; who, after they have gather'd it, dry it gently before the Fire, and the Leaves in drying curl up, ju&s;t as we have them brought over. In buying <HI>Tea,</HI> choo&s;e that which is greene&s;t, the be&s;t &s;cented, and which is as little broke into Du&s;t or &s;mall Powder as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>The COCAO Tree, that bears the <HI>Chocolate</HI> Nut, much re&s;embles our <HI>Heart-Cherry</HI> Tree; but at its full Growth &s;preads to a greater breadth in com|pa&s;s, and is &s;omething loftier: 'Tis well &s;upplied with Leaves, that re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Orange Tree; but are longer, and more &s;harp-pointed: It is always flouri&s;hing, e&s;pecially towards the two Sol&s;tices; for as the Leaves only fall off &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and as others grow again; this Tree never appears naked. The Blo&s;&s;oms are regular, and like a Ro&s;e, but very &s;mall and without Smell: Every Blo&s;&s;om is joined to the Tree by a &s;lender Stalk, and leaves in falling off long &s;tringly Filaments, which are green, from which a yellow pointed Fruit is form'd, of the &s;ize of our Melons; which adhere to the thick Boughs or Branches, not admitting of any Intermedium, or Stem, as Ap|ples do. Each Fruit contains from fifteen to twenty-five little Nuts, or Almonds; they are each of them cover'd with a yellowi&s;h thin Skin; which being &s;eparated, a tender Sub&s;tance appears, which is di|vided into &s;everal unequal Particles, that are olly, of good Nouri&s;hment, and leave a certain &s;harpne&s;s up|on the Palate. The&s;e Trees grow in all the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c. They commonly bear Fruit within &s;even Years &s;pace, or le&s;s, after their fir&s;t Plantation; tho' in the Interim they are &s;ome|times twice or thrice removed, and great Care is ta|ken to &s;ecure them with Shades, that they may not be injured by the over-powerful Heat of the &s;corch|ing Sun, of which they are not in danger, when
<PB N="88" REF="164">they once become great; for being planted in Ranks and regular Walks, &s;hady Plantane Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are rang'd with them; and one &s;helters the other, both from the parching Sun and boi&s;terous Wind. As it is a Tree of &s;ingular Beauty, having large, broad, ablong green Leaves, which fall back, and hang like &s;o ma|ny Shields, to pre&s;erve and defend the tender Fruit; &s;o is it likewi&s;e a Tree of great Profit to the Own|er, ari&s;ing from its mo&s;t de&s;irable Fruit, which grows after an admirable manner in Cods; &s;tudded, as it were in the very Body of the Tree, from the Earth up|wards, as well as the Arms and large Boughs: But the Fruit never grows at the Ends of the &s;mall Branches. And herein we may ea&s;ily apprehend, that if Nature had plac'd &s;uch bulky Fruit at the ends of the Branches, their great weight mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily break them; and the Fruit would fall before it come to Maturity. The Nuts, they &s;ay, among the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> go for current Money, even in tho&s;e Countries where Gold and Silver are naturally produc'd; being to them Food and Raiment, Riches and Delight, all at once. It &s;eems almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to tell the Reader, that the U&s;e of the&s;e Nuts is to make that well-known Liquor call'd <HI>Chocolate,</HI> every one being acquainted with it.</P>
<P>The SUGAR-CANE grows plentifully in many Parts of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands, as <HI>Barbadoes, Jamaica, Nevis,</HI> &amp;c.

The&s;e <HI>Canes</HI> are not hollow; but the Stalk is &s;tuffed with a porous Sub&s;tance, moi&s;t and &s;weet in ta&s;te. When they come to Maturity, which the Planters know by &s;everal Signs, as well as we know when our Harve&s;t is ready; they cut the <HI>Canes</HI> down at or above the fir&s;t Joint from the Ground; laying them in Heaps, as we u&s;ually lay our Corn in Harve&s;t time: then they clear them from their Leaves, and bind the Stalks in Bundles.

<P>CINNAMON is a thin Bark, taken from a Tree about the height of our Willow, which bears a Leaf &s;haped like the <HI>Indian</HI> Leaf called <HI>Malabathrum.</HI> The Flowers grow in little Cups of a light blue Colour, and odoriferous, &s;ucceeded by a Fruit of the &s;hape and &s;ize of a &s;mall Olive, green at fir&s;t, but growing black as it ripens.

If the Bark be fre&s;h taken off, that Juice which remains in the Tree hath a bitteri&s;h Ta&s;te, not unlike that of Cloves: On the contrary, if you ta&s;te the inner Membrane of the Bark when fre&s;h ta|ken off, you'll find it mo&s;t exqui&s;itely &s;weet, and ex|treamly agreeable to the Ta&s;le; whereas the outer part of the Bark differs but very little in Ta&s;te from that of the common Trees; which &s;hews plainly that all the Sweetne&s;s of it is owing only to the inner Membrane. But when the Bark is laid in the Sun in order to its being dried and wound up, this oily and agreeable Sweetne&s;s of the inner Membrane diffu&s;es it&s;elf throughout the whole outward part of it, (which however hath been fir&s;t &s;tripped while yet upon the Tree of its outermo&s;t greeni&s;h Coat) and imbues it &s;o &s;trongly, that for the fragrancy of its Smell and the &s;weetne&s;s of its Ta&s;te it is coveted all the World over.

The Flower is large, of a beautiful red, inclining to purple, compos'd of &s;everal Leaves, like a Ro&s;e in the hollow of a Cup, repre&s;enting a little Basket of Flowers; the Cup is oblong, hard, purpli&s;h, large at the top, having in &s;ome mea&s;ure the figure of a Bell. At the bottom comes a Fruit, after the Flower is gone, which grows into a large round Apple, having a thick, &s;mooth, brittle Rind, adorn'd with a Crown, form'd by the top of the Cup, of a purple Hue, dark without, and yellow within: this Apple is call'd <HI>the Pomegranate.</HI> The in&s;ide is divided into &s;everal Cells or Partitions full of Seed, heap'd one upon another, being fle&s;hy, of a fine red Colour, abounding with a very plea&s;ant Juice; and each contains in the mid|dle of them, an oblong Grain, of a yellow Colour, and &s;ometimes very irregularly form'd. The <HI>Wild Pomegranate</HI> is a Shrub like the former, but more rough and thorny: They gather the Flowers when in their prime; the&s;e are dry'd to keep, which are brought to us from the <HI>Levant.</HI> The <HI>Wild Pome|granate</HI> grows only in the hot Countries.

<PB N="98" REF="183">other Corn: The Leaves are long like the Reed, and fle&s;hy; the Flowers blow on the top like Barley; but the Seed, which follows, is di&s;pos'd in Clu&s;ters, each of which is enclos'd in a yellow Husk, ending in a &s;piral Thread, and of an oblong, or rather oval Figure.

After the <HI>Tobacco</HI> is thus planted, they will require no farther Care, but only from time to time to keep them clear from Weeds, until the Plants be|gin to &s;hew their Flower-Stems; at which time they cut off the tops of them, that their leaves may be the better nouri&s;h'd, become larger, and of a thicker Sub&s;tance; and likewi&s;e pulling off con&s;tantly the Leaves underneath, that hang on the Ground, &s;o that they leave about ten or twelve Leaves upon a Stalk, by which means they increa&s;e prodigiou&s;ly, and be|come much thicker. When the <HI>Tobacco</HI> is ripe, they cut and &s;pread it upon the Ground; after which they &s;tring it upon certain Cords, in little Knots, &s;o that the Plants may not touch one another; then they

<P>COTTON is the Product of a Plant which bears a Stalk about two Foot high, cover'd with a reddi&s;h hairy Bark, divided into &s;everal &s;hort Branches: The Leaves are a little le&s;s than the Sycamore Leaves, &s;hap'd almo&s;t like tho&s;e of the Vine, hanging to long Stalks, adorn'd with a kind of Nap, or Hair: The Flowers are numerous, fine and large, having the &s;hape or form of a Bell, &s;lit or cut into five or &s;ix Divi|&s;ions to the bottom, of a yellow Colour, mix'd with red or purple: When the Flower is fallen, 'tis &s;ucceed|ed by a Fruit the bigne&s;s of a Filbert; which being ripe opens into three or four Partitions, from whence appears a: Flake of <HI>Cotton,</HI> white as Snow, which &s;wells up or tume&s;ies by Heat, to the &s;ize of a little Apple. It contains in it many gro&s;s Seeds, like &s;mall Peas, ob|long and cottony; each having in it a little oily Ker|nel, &s;weet to the Ta&s;te. There is another &s;ort of <HI>Cotton</HI> Tree that differs from the former in bigne&s;s, for this grows to the height of four or five Feet: The Leaves indented deep into three Parts, without Nap or Down: The Flowers and Fruit are like tho&s;e of the other Kind. Both the&s;e &s;orts of <HI>Cotton</HI> grow in <HI>Egypt, Syria, Cyprus, Candia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI> In <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes,</HI> and other Places in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> the <HI>Cotton</HI> Tree u&s;ually grows to a rea&s;onable height, &s;preading &s;orth its Branches on all &s;ides; with &s;mall, green, pointed Leaves; and beareth a Flower in form almo&s;t like the Sweet-Briar Ro&s;e, but of a yellowi&s;h Colour: After the Blo&s;&s;oms are fallen, there followeth a kind of greeni&s;h round Button, or Knob almo&s;t as big as a Tennis Ball, having a thin cru&s;ty Shell; which when full rice is of a dark brown or blacki&s;h Colour: In the&s;e round Buttons is inclo&s;ed the <HI>Cotton,</HI> which open when ripe in &s;everal Parti|tions like the former, out of which the <HI>Cotton</HI> falleth, if not timely gather'd: it contains likewi&s;e a great number of &s;mall blacki&s;h Seeds, that grow inclo&s;ed in

<P>The MANDRAKE Plant is di&s;tingui&s;h'd by two Species; <HI>viz.</HI> the Common with a round Fruit, cal|led the <HI>Male Mandrake,</HI> and that with the purpli&s;h blue Flower, called the <HI>Female Mandrake.</HI> The Leaves of the former ri&s;e directly from the Root, above a Foot long, broader than a Man's Hand in the mid|dle, and narrow at both Ends, &s;mooth, of a deep green Colour, and a di&s;agreeable Smell. The Flow|ers of both the&s;e Plants are of the &s;hape of a Bell, divided at the tops into &s;everal Parts, which after|wards becomes a globular &s;oft Fruit, in which is con|rain'd many kidney-&s;hap'd Seeds. The Root, as &s;ome &s;ay, repre&s;ents, when it is whole, the lower Parts of a Man, from whence it is called <HI>Anthropomorpha,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Figure of a Man. But as to this feigned re&s;emblance of an human Form, which the Root of this Plant is &s;aid to carry, 'tis all Impo&s;ture, owing to the Cunning of Quacks and de&s;igning Knaves, who deceive the Ignorant with fictitious Images &s;hap'd from the fre&s;h Roots of <HI>Briony</HI> and other Plants: And what is reported as to the manner of rooting up this Plant, by tying a Dog thereto, to prevent the cer|tain Death of the Per&s;on who &s;hould dare to attempt it, and the Groans it emits upon the Force offer'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is all a ful&s;ome Fable: for &s;everal large Roots of this Plant have been taken up; &s;ome of which have been tran&s;planted into other Places, without ob&s;erving any particular difference in this from any other deep|rooting Plant. Some Per&s;ons worthy of Credit, have deliver'd as a Truth, that one of the&s;e Roots will re|main &s;ound above fifty Years, and be as vigorous as a young Plant; but they &s;hould never be remov'd af|ter their Roots have arriv'd to any con&s;iderable &s;ize, which would break their lower Fibres, and &s;o &s;tint the Plants, as that they will not recover their for|mer &s;trength in two or three Years.

<PB N="103" REF="192">Mandrake</HI> with the blui&s;h purple Flower; differs from the former, in that its Leaves are &s;maller, nar|rower, more folded, blacker, trailing on the Ground, of a &s;trong &s;tinking Smell; and the Fruit le&s;s and paler, not form'd like a Pear, as &s;ome Authors will have it; but round, &s;cented, full of Juice, and con|taining very &s;mall black Seeds. The Root is about a Foot long, divided into two Branches, brown with|out, white within, and furni&s;h'd with &s;ome Fibres, but nothing like the Male Plant. Both &s;orts grow in hot Countries, in the Plains or mountainous Places; but the la&s;t much rarer. The&s;e Plants are propagat|ed in Gardens from Seeds, which &s;hou'd be &s;own upon a Bed of light Earth &s;oon after they are ripe; where they &s;hould remain till the latter end of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> (ob&s;erving always to keep them clear from Weeds) at which time they &s;hould be taken up very carefully, and tran&s;planted into the Places where they are to re|main, which &s;hould be a light deep Soil, for their Roots do always run downwards very deep; and if the Plants are not di&s;turb'd, they will grow to a large &s;ize in a few Years, and will produce great quantities of Flowers and Fruit, and they will abide a great many Years. There are <HI>Mandrakes</HI> mention'd in the 30th Chap. of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> which <HI>Reuben</HI> is &s;aid to have found in the Field, in the time of Wheat Harve&s;t; and with which his Mother <HI>Leah</HI> purchas'd from her Si&s;ter <HI>Rachel</HI> no le&s;s a Favour than the Enjoyment of her Husband. What tho&s;e <HI>Mandrakes</HI> &s;hould be that were &s;o de&s;irable to <HI>Rachel;</HI> whether &s;he coveted them for their delectable Ta&s;te, their fragrant Smell, or their beautiful Colour, does not appear: And as our learned Commentators differ in their Opinions about it, I &s;hall not venture to give my own; but only ob&s;erve, that in the <HI>Canticles</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>The Man|drakes give a &s;mell, and at our gates are all manner of plea&s;ant fruits:</HI> Which &s;eems to intimate, as if the <HI>Mandrakes</HI> were a Fruit of a plea&s;ant Ta&s;te, a fragrant Smell, and delightful to the Eye: for when <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Mandrakes give a &s;mell;</HI> &s;ure he mu&s;t mean a grateful Smell, or methinks he would hardly have introduc'd them to adorn a Pa&s;toral Song: and as he
<PB N="104" REF="193">immediately adds, <HI>at our gates are all manner of plea|&s;ant fruits;</HI> it &s;eems to imply, that the <HI>Mandrake</HI> was likewi&s;e a plea&s;ant Fruit, which perhaps, was &s;o both to the Eye and Palate: But be that as it will, this we may venture to affirm, that the <HI>Mandrake</HI> Plants known to us now, whether wild or cultivated; have no &s;uch de&s;irable qualities, as to render them &s;o va|luable to the good Women of our days, to give in exchange their Husbands for them: For the&s;e, con|trary to what is mention'd in Scripture, have a di&s;|agreeable Smell.</P>
<P>BALM <HI>of Gilead</HI> is a liquid white Bal&s;am, that flows of it&s;elf (tho' &s;ometimes they make Inci&s;ions, when the Liquor flows not freely) during Summer, from the Trunk of a Plant, called <HI>Bal&s;amum Syria|cum folio Rutae;</HI> that bears Leaves like Rue; and white Flowers &s;hap'd like Stars; in the middle of which ri&s;e little Berries, that are &s;harp at the end, in which is a &s;mall Kernel: It &s;ticks to the Branches by means of a very &s;mall Stalk; is green at fir&s;t, and grows brown as it ripens. When the <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> fir&s;t runs, it is of the con&s;i&s;tence of Oil of &s;weet Almonds, but by Age becomes like Turpentine, lo&s;es much of its Smell, and grows &s;ometimes blacki&s;h. When fre&s;h, it is of a very agreeable aromatick Smell, and of a Ta&s;te like Citron Peel. <HI>Jerico</HI> was once the only Place in the World where this true <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> was to be found; but &s;ince the <HI>Turks</HI> were Ma&s;ters of the Holy Land, they have tran&s;planted the&s;e Shrubs into their Gardens at <HI>Grand Cairc,</HI> &amp;c. where they are guarded by <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> or Soldiers, during the time the <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> flows; at which time it is very difficult for a Chri&s;tian to get a Sight of the&s;e Plants, which are de&s;ended with very high Walls, as well as Sol|diers, again&s;t their entering. And as to the <HI>Bal&s;am,</HI> it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to get any upon the Place, un|le&s;s it be by means of &s;ome Amba&s;&s;ador, to whom the Grand Seignior has made a Pre&s;ent of it, or by The Soldiers who watch this precious Liquor; by which we may under&s;tand, that what &s;everal Per&s;ons pretend to &s;ell for true <HI>Bal&s;am,</HI> is nothing but white

<P>The CEDAR <HI>of Libanus</HI> is a very large, thick, &s;traight Tree: Its Leaves &s;mall and &s;lender; being much narrower than tho&s;e of the Pine-Tree, di&s;po&s;ed in Clu&s;ters along the Branches; and the Fruit like our Pine-Apples; but grows upon the upper part of the Branches, and &s;tands erect, having a &s;trong woody central Style, by which it is firmly annex'd to the Branch, &s;o as with difficulty to be taken off: which central Style remains upon the Branches, after the Cone is fallen to pieces; &s;o that they never drop off whole as the Pine-Apples do. It is &s;aid, that from the Trunk, and the large Branches of this Tree, there flows, during the great Heats, without any Inci|&s;ion, a &s;ort of white Re&s;in, very clear, and of a grateful Odour; which they call <HI>Cedar-Gum,</HI> of which the large&s;t Trees yield not le&s;s than &s;ix Ounces a day. The <HI>Cones</HI> of the <HI>Cedar</HI> are brought from the <HI>Le|vant,</HI> which, if pre&s;erv'd intire, will continue their Seeds for &s;everal Years: The time of their ripening is commonly in the Spring, and are near one Year old before we receive them; for which they are not the wor&s;e, but rather the better. To get the Seeds out of the Cone, they &s;plit it, by driving a &s;harp piece of Iron through the Centre lengthways, and &s;o pull the Seeds out with their Fingers; which Seeds are fa&s;ten'd to a thin leafy Sub&s;tance, as are tho&s;e of the Firr-Tree. For the ordering the <HI>Cedar</HI> Plant, &s;ee <HI>Miller</HI>'s Directions in his <HI>Gardener's Dictionary.</HI> What we find mention'd in Scripture of the <HI>lofty Cedars,</HI> can be no ways applicable to the Stature of this Tree; &s;ince, from the Experience we have of tho&s;e now growing in <HI>England,</HI> as al&s;o from the Te&s;timony of &s;everal who have vi&s;ited tho&s;e few remaining Trees on <HI>Mount Libanus,</HI> they are not inclin'd to grow very lo&s;ty, but, on the contrary, extend their Branches
<PB N="106" REF="196">very far: To which the Allu&s;ion made by the <HI>P&s;alm|i&s;t</HI> agrees very well, when he is de&s;cribing the flou|ri&s;hing State of a People, and &s;ays, <HI>They &s;hall &s;pread their Branches like the Cedar Tree.</HI> Mr. <HI>Maundrel,</HI> in his <HI>Travels,</HI> &s;ays, when he vi&s;ited <HI>Mount Libanus,</HI> there were but &s;ixteen large Trees remaining; &s;ome of which were of a prodigious Bulk, but that there were many more young Trees of a &s;maller &s;ize; he mea&s;ur'd one of the large&s;t, and found it to be twelve Yards &s;ix Inches in girt, and yet &s;ound, and thirty &s;even Yards in the &s;pread of its Boughs. At about five or &s;ix Yards from the Ground, it was divided into five Limbs, each of which was equal to a great Tree. The Wood of this famous Tree is accounted Proof again&s;t all Putrefaction of Animal Bodies: The Saw-du&s;t of it is thought to be one of the Secrets u&s;ed by tho&s;e Mountebanks who pretend to have the embalming My&s;tery.

<P>The ANANAS is a kind of Pine-Apple: adorn|ed on the top with a little Crown, and a Bunch of red Leaves like Fire: It has a &s;caly Rind or Shell, like the Pine-Apple; and the Fruit like the Cones of the Pine, in the Form of a Sugar-Loaf: The in&s;ide appears like that of the Melon; the Fle&s;h is fibrous, but di&s;&s;olves in the Mouth, having the delicious Ta&s;te of the Peach, the Quince, and the Mu&s;cadine Grape all together.

The fir&s;t Per&s;on who &s;ucceeded in this Affair, was Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Cour</HI> at <HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> who, after a great many Trials with little or no &s;uc|ce&s;s, did at la&s;t hit upon a proper degree of Heat and Management, &s;o as to produce Fruit equally as good (tho' not &s;o large) as tho&s;e which are produc'd in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> as hath been often affirm'd by Per|&s;ons who have lived many Years there; and 'tis to this worthy Cultivator of Gardening, who did not &s;pare any Pains or Expence to accompli&s;h it, that all the Lovers thereof are oblig'd for introducing this King of Fruits among&s;t them; and it was from him that our Gardens in <HI>England</HI> were fir&s;t &s;upplied, tho' we have &s;ince had large quantities brought from <HI>America.</HI> From the Juice of this Fruit is made a Wine, almo&s;t equal to Malm&s;ey Sack, and will intoxicate as &s;oon as the &s;tronge&s;t Wine.</P>
<P>The ALOE is a Plant who&s;e Leaves are thick and &s;ucculent, and for the mo&s;t part be&s;et with Spines on the Edges: The Flower con&s;i&s;ts of one Leaf, is tubulous, and cut into &s;ix Segments at the top, like the Hyacinth: The Fruit is oblong and cylindrical; which is divided into three Cells, in which are confin'd flat, and for the mo&s;t part &s;emi|circular Seeds. There are a great variety of the&s;e Plants in the curious Gardens of Botany in <HI>England,</HI> near forty different &s;orts, which are Natives both of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> but the mo&s;t curious &s;orts are brought from the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> Mo&s;t of the <HI>African</HI> &s;orts of <HI>Aloes</HI> do produce Flowers with us Annually, when grown to a &s;ufficient &s;ize, which is often the &s;econd, and &s;eldom more than the third
<PB N="108" REF="200">or fourth Year, after planting from Off-&s;ets; but the <HI>American Aloes</HI> (which do, for the mo&s;t part, produce their Flower-&s;tems immediately from the Center of the Plant) &s;eldom flower till they are of a con&s;iderable Age, and this but once during the Life of the Plant; for when the Flower-&s;tem begins to &s;hoot from the middle of the Plant (which, for the mo&s;t part, is of a large &s;ize, and grows to a great height) it draws all the Nouri&s;hment from the Leaves; &s;o that, as that advances, the Leaves de|cay: and when the Flowers are fully blown, &s;carce any of the Leaves remain alive; but whenever this happens, the old Root &s;ends forth a numerous quan|tity of Off-&s;ets for increa&s;e: And it is not till this time, that &s;ome of the&s;e &s;orts can be increa&s;ed. There is a vulgar Error or two relating to the large <HI>Ameri|can Aloe,</HI> which is, that it never flowers until it is an Hundred Years old: this is a Mi&s;take; &s;ince we have had &s;everal of them flower in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome of which were known not to exceed fifty Years old; and others, that flower'd many Years ago, cannot be &s;uppos'd to have been in <HI>England</HI> &s;o long as to arrive at that Age, &s;ince they were thought too tender for our Climate at that time, when Green|hou&s;es were not known. Another common Error is, that when the Flower opens, it makes a Report like that of firing a Gun: This is &s;ufficiently confuted by all tho&s;e, who have been where the&s;e Plants have flower'd: But probably the ri&s;e of this Story might proceed from &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;aying, when one of the&s;e Plants flower'd, it made a great Noi&s;e; meaning thereby, that whenever one of them flower'd in <HI>England,</HI> it was &s;pread abroad as an uncommon thing, and occa&s;ion'd a great Noi&s;e among the neighbouring Inhabitants; mo&s;t of whom u&s;ually repair to &s;ee it, as a thing that rarely happens, and as a great Curio&s;ity.

<P>The Contexture of the SENSIBLE PLANT is very &s;urpri&s;ing; for, upon touching any of the Sprigs with Leaves on, all the Leaves on that Sprig contracting them&s;elves by Pairs, joined their upper Superfices clo&s;e together. Upon the dropping a Drop of <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> on the Sprig betwixt the Leaves, all the Leaves above &s;hut pre&s;ently, tho&s;e below by Pairs &s;ucce&s;&s;ively after, by and by the lower Leaves of the other Branches, and &s;o every Pair &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, with &s;ome little di&s;tance of time betwixt, to the top of each Sprig, and &s;o they continued &s;hut for &s;ome time: But returning to the Garden the next Day, and &s;everal Days after, found all the Leaves dilated again on two of the Sprigs; but where the <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> had dropped, upwards, dead and withered; but tho&s;e below on the &s;ame Sprig, green, and clo&s;|ing upon the Touch as before, and continu'd &s;o.

Upon cut|ting off one of the harder Branches, there came out a Liquor, without pre&s;&s;ure; very clear, and of a bright greeni&s;h Colour, ta&s;ting at fir&s;t a little bitter|i&s;h, but after leaving a liquorice like Ta&s;te behind:
<PB N="110" REF="203">which probably, the Motion of this Plant upon touching might proceed from this; that there being a con&s;tant Intercour&s;e betwixt every Part of this Plant and its Root, either by a Circulation of this Liquor, or a con&s;tant pre&s;&s;ing of the &s;ubtiler Parts of it to every Extremity of the Plant.

<P>An Attempt therefore to prove the contrary, and that the <HI>Light</HI> called by this Name proceeds from &s;ome nocturnal <HI>Flying-In&s;ect,</HI> will perhaps be deemed vain and ra&s;h. However, I &s;hall take the Liberty to a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;ons which induce me to believe it, and my Objections to its being a Vapour; which I &s;ub|mit to the Judgment of the Curious, till time and experience &s;hall demon&s;trate the real Truth.</P>
<P>If in my Pur&s;uit of the Wanderer I &s;hould chance to be mi&s;led, it will be in common with all that have followed the Chace, with this advantage, that
<PB N="114" REF="207">I can &s;u&s;tain no Injuries from it. And the Attempt may invite others, who may be more &s;ucce&s;sful in their Endeavours. The Conjecture mu&s;t be agree|able, and the Probability will be of &s;ome u&s;e, if it helps to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s fearful Country People of their &s;u|per&s;titious Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Hint of my Opinion I received from <HI>Meriana</HI>'s Account of the famous <HI>Indian</HI> LANT|HORN FLY, publi&s;h'd among&s;t her In&s;ects of <HI>Su|rinam;</HI> which Account, being not in the lea&s;t foreign to the Subject, nor perhaps unplea&s;ant to the Reader, I &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lanthorn Fly</HI> is a Nocturnal In&s;ect, that has an Hood, or Bladder on its Head, which gives a Light like a Lanthorn in the Night, but by Day|light is clear and tran&s;parent, very curiou&s;ly adorned with Stripes of a red and green Colour. Such a &s;hining came forth from this Bladder in the Night, that it was po&s;&s;ible by the Light of it to have read Writing of tolerable large Characters. She &s;ays, that when once upon a time, the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;he &s;ent to &s;eek for In&s;ects, brought her of the&s;e <HI>Lanthorn Flies</HI> in great abundance, &s;he &s;hut them up in a large Che&s;t, not knowing as yet that they &s;hone by Night; but being awak'd and frighten'd in the Night out of her Sleep by an unu&s;ual Noi&s;e; jumping out of Bed, or|der'd a Light to be brought; not knowing what that uncommon Di&s;turbance which &s;he heard in her Hou&s;e &s;hould be: It immediately appear'd that the Noi&s;e came from the Che&s;t; upon which, with &s;ome di&s;|order of Mind they open'd it; but &s;till more fright|en'd, they &s;uddenly clapp'd the Lid down again; becau&s;e in the opening, there came as it were a Flame of Fire, as often as a new In&s;ect flew out: which
<PB N="115" REF="208">at length being ob&s;erv'd, and coming to them&s;elves again, they gather'd the little Creatures together once more; admiring that &s;o con&s;iderable a Light &s;hould proceed from them.</P>
<P>The Wings and whole Body of this In&s;ect are ele|gantly adorned with a Mixture of beautiful Colours; as red, green, yellow, &amp;c. It's &s;aid, the Creature can contract or dilate the Hood or Bladder over its Head at plea&s;ure: and that they hide all their Light when taken, but when at liberty afford it plentifully. Accordingly, tho&s;e which <HI>Meriana</HI> inclos'd having the Liberty of a large dark Che&s;t, di&s;play'd their Light, and it being their proper time to fly, endea|vour'd to e&s;cape as &s;oon as the Lid was open.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider'd this wonderful Account, the &s;tronger it inclin'd me to believe the <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> of our own Country, was likewi&s;e no other than the &s;hining of &s;ome night-flying In&s;ect. And indeed I was too well pleas'd with the Di&s;covery I thought I had made, vainly imagining my Opinion to be &s;ingular; nor knowing that any Per&s;on had formed the Conjecture before my &s;elf; till, looking into the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> I was agreeably &s;urprized, to find that two learned and eminent Per|&s;ons, the late Mr. <HI>Fr. Willughby,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> were both of the &s;ame Opinion. The late learned and ingenious Dr. <HI>Derham</HI> indeed, who publi&s;h'd that Account, was of a contrary Opinion: believing tho&s;e Appearances to be fired Vapours. But with due Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Judgment of &s;o great a Man, the Ac|count he has given of this Phaenomenon, &s;eems in every Circum&s;tance to agree much better with that of a living Creature, than an inflammable Vapour.
<PB N="116" REF="209">Which Account of the <HI>Ignes Fatui,</HI> I &s;hall tran&s;cribe from the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,</HI> for the &s;ake of &s;uch of my Readers as are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e Books.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall fir&s;t give the Rea&s;ons which incline me to believe the&s;e Appearances only the &s;hining of &s;ome Nocturnal Flies; becau&s;e they are the Re&s;ult of &s;uch Thoughts as occurr'd from con&s;idering the Subject it&s;elf, before I knew the Sentiments of tho&s;e emi|nent Per&s;ons abovemention'd.</P>
<P>I apprehend then that the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> mu&s;t be ra|ther a flying In&s;ect than a Vapour, becau&s;e the Pro|perties attributed to it, &s;uch as its Motion, directing it&s;elf which way it plea&s;es, &s;hunning whatever Ob|&s;truction happens in its Pa&s;&s;age, and the like, in which almo&s;t all Accounts agree, corre&s;pond much bet|ter to that of an In&s;ect flying, or the Actions of &s;ome|thing guided by Sen&s;e; than to that of a fired Va|pour, which mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely carried with the Wind, let it blow which way it will: And may we not very naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that if it was only a Va|pour driven by the Wind, it would &s;ome time or other have been blown exactly to the Spot where &s;ome Per&s;ons were pa&s;&s;ing, that might have di&s;cover'd what it was; or directly to &s;ome Hou&s;e, Village, Town? &amp;<HI>c.</HI> I cannot imagine how a mere Vapour could &s;hun any of the&s;e Ob&s;tructions. And would a fired Vapour, if once extinct, (as the&s;e Appearances are frequently ob&s;erved to be &s;uddenly dark, and im|mediately to &s;hine again) be enkindled in a Body any more?</P>
<P>Methinks, if <HI>Igues Fatui</HI> were only Vapours, they would &s;ometimes be rai&s;ed higher in the Air than the&s;e Lights are ob&s;erved to be, which &s;eldom ex|ceeds
<PB N="117" REF="210">&s;ix Feet above the Ground; unle&s;s it be to mount over a Hedge, or &s;ome &s;uch thing. But their pa&s;&s;ing along a few Feet above the Ground, or &s;ur|face of the Water, very much agrees with that of &s;ome In&s;ects in que&s;t of their Prey; and does not their &s;ettling of a &s;udden, and ri&s;ing again immedi|ately, an&s;wer likewi&s;e? It looks very much as if they had found &s;omething which they were in &s;earch af|ter. From hence there appears great Rea&s;on to be|lieve it nothing el&s;e but a Night-flying Infect; and that the Light it carries is given either to &s;eek its Food with, or woo its Female, or perhaps both.</P>
<P>All Accounts agree, that the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> is never &s;een but in a dark Night, which is &s;till a &s;tronger Argu|ment of its being a living Creature; for a Vapour might be exhalld when it was not &s;o dark, as well as when it was, and be vi&s;ible too. But &s;uppo&s;ing it a Creature that flies by Night, it may either not &s;ally out in light Nights, or its Organs of Sight be &s;o adapted, as to &s;ee at &s;uch a time without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of this extraordinary Light, and not expend its &s;hining Matter when its natural Eyes will &s;erve; but u&s;e this Lamp or Lanthorn in dark Nights only, when Nece&s;&s;ity obliges it: For perhaps, the Mate|rials that this &s;hining Matter is compos'd of, may co&s;t the Creature &s;ome Labour to gather, tho' Nature may fit it for U&s;e afterwards. And 'tis not unlikely that the &s;uppos'd little Animal may have a Receptacle to pre&s;erve its &s;hining Matter in, which it lets out when occa|&s;ion requires; for this Light is no real Fire, but the Appearance only.</P>
<P>But altho' we are not able to give a &s;atisfactory Account of what this Light con&s;i&s;ts of, this carries no real Objection to its being a Night-&s;hining Fly:
<PB N="118" REF="211">becau&s;e we are well a&s;&s;ured, that there are flying In|&s;ects peculiar to &s;everal Countries that actually do &s;hine in dark Nights, and yield Lights, not much different from tho&s;e of our <HI>Ignes Fatui.</HI></P>
<P>To me it &s;eems not altogether improbable, that this &s;uppos'd In&s;ect may be furni&s;h'd with a kind of na|tural Pho&s;phorus, perhaps in quality not unlike the great Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Noctilucal Matter, or Night-&s;hin|ing Stuff; which when reduced to a Powder, and put into a Phial, gently heated at the Fire, and then &s;hook; whereby the &s;mall Particles of this &s;hining Matter being put into Motion, would in a dark Room yield a Light very vivid. [<HI>See</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Experiments and Ob&s;ervations made upon the <HI>Icy,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Noctiluca.</HI>] That the like Agitation may be perform|ed by the&s;e &s;hining Flies naturally, without any diffi|culty, either by Re&s;piration, or by the Motion of its Wings or Legs, &s;eems not at all improbable.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this is what Mr. <HI>Templer</HI> ob&s;erv'd of the Glo-worm. Putting, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Glo-worm into a &s;mall thin Box, (&s;uch as Pills are u&s;ually &s;ent in) <HI>May</HI> 27. between Eleven and Twelve at Night, I &s;aw her &s;hine thro' the Box very clearly on one &s;ide, the Box &s;hut; putting white Paper into the Box, and the Worm into the Paper, it &s;hined through the Paper and Box both. The next Morning, about Eight of the Clock, &s;he &s;eemed dead, and holding her in a very dark Place, I could perceive very lit|tle Light, and that only when &s;he was turned on her Back, and by con&s;equence put into &s;ome little voluntary Motion. After Sun-&s;et that Night, &s;he walked briskly up and down in her Box, &s;hining clearly as the Night before. The 29th in the Morn|ing &s;he &s;eemed dead again, at Night recovered her
<PB N="119" REF="212">&s;elf, and &s;hined as well as ever in the Box. I ne|ver, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;aw her &s;hine without &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Mo|tion either in her Body or Legs. In her clear&s;t &s;hining &s;he extended her Body a third part beyond its u&s;ual length. The Glo-worm having contracted her Body into a bending Po&s;ture, &s;hined little, the Light &s;carcely &s;o big as a great Pin's head; upon touching of her &s;he extended her &s;elf, walked in her Box, and at fir&s;t Extent &s;hined as gloriou&s;ly as ever. <HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act.</HI> N^o. 72.</P>
<P>The U&s;e that I would make of the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the Glo-worm, is to &s;trengthen the Probability that the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> Fly, and other &s;hining Flies, as well as the Glo-worm, emit their Light, by putting the &s;mall Particles of &s;hin|ing Matter into motion, from &s;ome voluntary Mo|tion in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It has been objected, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that the&s;e Lights were too large for any In&s;ect whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> That they were always carried along with the Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> That they were never &s;een but in Salt-Mar&s;hes, or other Boggy Grounds.</P>
<P>And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> which &s;eems to be the &s;tronge&s;t of all the Objections; if this Light proceeds from a flying In&s;ect, how comes it that the Creature has never yet been di&s;cover'd? or how was it po&s;&s;ible to have e&s;cap|ed the narrow Searches of &s;o many curious Per&s;ons, as have with indefatigable labour collected all the In&s;ects po&s;&s;ible to be procur'd, both of our own Country, and likewi&s;e from Abroad; and have with &s;o great Care examin'd the Contexture of mo&s;t In|&s;ects, as well as larger Animals, and as it were ana|tomi&s;ed their di&s;tinct Parts; have been able to render
<PB N="120" REF="213">a con&s;i&s;tent and rational Account of the various U&s;e tho&s;e Parts &s;eem'd to be de&s;igned for; and yet it &s;hould never enter into any of their Heads, that &s;uch a Creature was a nocturnal Luminous In&s;ect, and probably the <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> that had &s;o. long amu&s;ed and puzzled Mankind to account for?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Objection urges the Impo&s;&s;ibility of an In&s;ect carrying a Light &s;o large as the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> appears to be.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Accounts agree, that the&s;e Lights commonly appear of the bigne&s;s of that of a middling Candle, and &s;ometimes they have been &s;een much &s;maller; tho' &s;ome indeed have &s;aid, they have &s;een in other Countries the&s;e Appearances equal to that of a Torch. Every one knows that Light magnifies in the Night, the darker the Night, the bigger the Light &s;eems to be; and what appear'd &s;o luminous at a di&s;tance, the nearer you approach it the le&s;s it grows. The &s;ame has been ob&s;erv'd of the <HI>Ignis Fatuus;</HI> which, as before &s;aid, is no real Fire, but the Appearance only. It is well known, the <HI>Lanthorn Fly</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> when at Liberty, &s;ometimes emits a Light not far &s;hort of what is reported of the bigge&s;t of our <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn:</HI> and this Light being contain'd in the Bladder on its Head, the Creature, as is &s;aid, can either contract, or dilate at Plea&s;ure. The Glo-worm can encrea&s;e or dimini&s;h its &s;hining; and very pro|bably the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> Fly can do the &s;ame; or its Light appearing bigger or le&s;s, may be in proportion to the Size or Perfection of the Creature that emits it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Objection is, That this Light was al|ways carried along with the Wind. If that were true, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for it to &s;hun any kind
<PB N="121" REF="214">of Ob&s;truction in its way, whether Man, Bea&s;t, Bank, Hedge, Hou&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but would unavoidably &s;ome|times have been driven again&s;t &s;ome or other of them; which I never heard it was; but on the contrary &s;hunn'd them as carefully as if guided by Sen&s;e. Be&s;ides, it can be proved by undeniable Te&s;timony, that this Light moves any way it plea&s;es, ju&s;t as a flying In&s;ect would do, bu&s;ied in &s;eeking its Food, &s;porting it&s;elf, or &s;ome other Employment. It mu&s;t be own'd, indeed, that a flying In&s;ect is generally carry'd with the Wind, not caring, or not able (e&s;pecially when it blows any thing hard) to beat again&s;t it; unle&s;s it be &s;uch who have Homes, and young Offsprings to take care of, and who&s;e Bodies are fitly balanc'd to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch Winds. Thus far the Motion of an In&s;ect, will agree with that of a Vapour carried by the Wind.</P>
<P>The third Objection, that the <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> are ne|ver &s;een but in Salt-Mar&s;hes, or other Boggy Places; is a great Mi&s;take. I can produce Per&s;ons of Vera|city, that have &s;een the&s;e Lights flying over Fields, Heaths, and other dry Places. A few Days &s;ince a grave Gentleman, a Per&s;on of exceeding good Know|ledge, told me, that in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> about eleven a Clock in a dark Night, he &s;aw one of the&s;e Lights flying over a fallow piece of Ground: being within three or four Fields of his Habitation, he was per|fectly acquainted with the Ground thereabouts, and well a&s;&s;ured there was no hazard of being led into Bogs, Rivers, or other dangerous Places; his Curio|&s;ity led him to follow it, re&s;olving, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover what it was, (for though he had heard it was only a Vapour exhal'd from the Earth, he had
<PB N="122" REF="215">&s;till &s;ome Doubt about it.) It led him over a plow'd Field, flying and twi&s;ting about from place to place; &s;ometimes it would &s;uddenly di&s;appear, and as &s;ud|denly appear again: &s;ometimes it would drop down, and pre&s;ently ri&s;e again. Once it made directly to a Hedge but a &s;mall di&s;tance from him, which, as &s;oon as it came pretty near, it mounted over; and he lo&s;t &s;ight of it, after he had follow'd it a full Hour without the lea&s;t Satisfaction. He then turn'd about to make the be&s;t of his way home, when pre|&s;ently he &s;pied it again: but finding it next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to approach near enough to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity about it, and being pretty well tired; gave over the Pur&s;uit, and would follow it no further. The &s;ame Per&s;on &s;ays, That in <HI>Surry</HI> he has &s;een in a dark Night &s;ix or &s;even of the&s;e Lights at one time, flying over a boggy Common. And that he has &s;een the&s;e Appearances flying over Lands where there has been neither Ponds nor Bogs.</P>
<P>If the Objection to its being an In&s;ect, becau&s;e &s;een only in Boggy Places, would hold good; it would infallibly de&s;troy the la&s;t Objection of its being always carried along with the Wind. For as the&s;e Lights frequently hold collected in a Body, for an Hour or more, as has been oftentimes ob&s;erv'd, they might, nay certainly would (&s;ometimes in half that time) be driven over Fields, and other dry Places, according to the &s;trength of the Wind. But it will admit of a Doubt, whether an inflammable Vapour, would con|tinue collected in a Body many Minutes, expos'd to &s;o much Wind as would be &s;ufficient to carry it along, without being very &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="216">I don't deny that the&s;e Appearances are more fre|quently &s;een in Boggy, and Mar&s;hy Grounds: The Creature may very probably feed on watry In&s;ects; and as all Animals are naturally endued with the Sen&s;e of knowing the &s;ure Places where to find their Food, &s;o may the <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> Fly likewi&s;e frequent watry Places for that very end; at which Places, as the mo&s;t likely, the Males may meet and woo their Females al&s;o; the flying State being the Perfection, and la&s;t State of all the winged Tribes of In&s;ects; in which they generate, lay their Eggs, and after which few kinds of them long &s;urvive.</P>
<P>This Light being often ob&s;erv'd to &s;tand &s;till as well as move, and &s;ometimes &s;eeming fixed on the Surface of the Water; we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e at &s;uch a time it &s;ettles upon the Ground, Gra&s;s, or Weeds, as other In&s;ects do; and may perhaps either have found, and be devouring its Prey, or watching to catch it; which it could not do without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of this extraordinary Light.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t Objection; If an <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> were only the &s;hining of &s;ome In&s;ect, how comes it that the Creature never yet was di&s;cover'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I reply, That the &s;uppos'd <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> Fly's not being yet di&s;cover'd, may in a great mea&s;ure be accounted for. All Night-Animals in general have Places of Retreat, where they hide them&s;elves in the Day-time: to the&s;e Places of Retirement, they &s;eem as naturally to be|take them&s;elves, as other Animals to Re&s;t and Sleep. Some find a proper convenient Receptacle under the Earth in Holes; &s;ome in Timber, Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> others lying on the Ground, among&s;t Weeds, or in Hedges, hollow Trees, or under the Bark, or in the Wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="217">It would be endle&s;s to recount the various Methods Nature has taught the&s;e little Creatures to &s;ecure them&s;elves from Dangers.</P>
<P>We all know that &s;uch Animals as fly a Nights, are &s;luggi&s;h and heavy in the Day-time, not caring to &s;tir, and with difficulty are put on the Wing; hardly any thing le&s;s than their Pre&s;ervation will force them to it; as the Bat, Owl, Beetle, Chafer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Creatures fly only for about an Hour in the Dusk of the Evening; and &s;o do not &s;tand in need of that extraordinary Light as the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Jack in the Lant|horn</HI> Fly, which is always ob&s;erv'd to &s;ally out in very dark Nights. And if tho&s;e Animals are &s;o &s;lug|gi&s;h, that fly in the Evening only; what may we &s;uppo&s;e of the <HI>Will with a Whi&s;p,</HI> which flies chiefly when late at Night.</P>
<P>The Glo-worm, as Mr. <HI>Templer</HI> ob&s;erv'd, always &s;eem'd as if dead in the Day-time; yet con&s;tantly at Night would be brisk, and &s;hine as vivid as ever.</P>
<P>If by chance in the Day-time any Per&s;on &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e the &s;luggi&s;h <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> Fly, in its Place of Shelter or Retreat, (which perhaps may have often happen'd, both in its creeping, and fly|ing State likewi&s;e) very likely they would de&s;troy it, as common People do mo&s;t In&s;ects as noxious Crea|tures; e&s;pecially when large and uncommon: But if they &s;hould happen not to kill it, not one in ten thou&s;and but would leave it where they found it, without regarding it at all.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, it is not only difficult to di&s;cover this In&s;ect in the Day-time; but if a thou&s;and had been found, it would be next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to know they were &s;hining Flies; becau&s;e the Part that
<PB N="125" REF="218">contains the luminous Matter, like that of the <HI>Indian</HI> Lanthorn Flies, appears by Day-light only clear and pellucid, without any &s;hining at all. Be&s;ides, it may perhaps be an In&s;ect not of the multiparous kind, con&s;equently the &s;eldomer to be met with.</P>
<P>The Difficulty of catching this &s;uppo&s;ed In&s;ect by Night, has been as great hitherto, as that of know|ing it by Day. For <HI>Ignes Fatui,</HI> as all agree, appear only in dark Nights, and commonly when late; at which time the benighted Traveller wants to be at Home, or perhaps the Stories he has heard of the <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI>'s leading &s;uch as follow it into Rivers, and other dangerous Places, deterr him from going after it. But if it happen'd he was neither in ha&s;te, nor afraid; it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to follow it in a dark Night, among&s;t Bogs, Lakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where this In&s;ect is u&s;ually &s;porting and frisking over the Waters. Should we not conclude the Per&s;on, that would perhaps ri&s;que his Life in attempting to catch what he thinks a Vapour, more infatuated than the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> he is in pur&s;uit after.</P>
<P>It was never yet known that any Per&s;on approach'd &s;o near this Light, as to di&s;cover certainly what it was. But as &s;ome Per&s;ons have attempted to draw near it for that intent (when by chance they have &s;een it in a Place ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, tho' not one in a thou|&s;and have had the Courage to venture) the cunning Vapour, as if &s;en&s;ible of their De&s;ign, and for its own Security, withdraws its Light, as it were a dark Lanthorn, and takes that opportunity to e&s;cape; leaving the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> Hunter in the dark among&s;t Bogs and Fens, to find his way out again; whil&s;t <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn</HI> appears again, two or three
<PB N="126" REF="219">hundred Yards off, &s;porting over the Brooks and Meadows, exerci&s;ed in its beloved Employment.</P>
<P>It appears upon the whole, that the various Pro|perties ob&s;ervable in the&s;e Lights carry evident Marks of Sen&s;e; to attribute them therefore to fired Va|pours moving without any Direction, is an Explica|tion that renders the Subject but more unintelligible.</P>
<P>The late ingenious <HI>R. Bradley,</HI> F. R. S. his Opi|nion of the&s;e Appearances was as follows. The <HI>Ig|nis Fatuus,</HI> &s;ays he, or <HI>Jack in the Lanthorn,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e to be no more than a Group of &s;mall enlight|ned In&s;ects, rather than &s;uppo&s;e it an inflammable Vapour, as &s;ome have taken it to be; for if it con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch Effluvia or Corpu&s;cula as ri&s;e from the Earth or Waters, that were inflammable, and by &s;ome Cau&s;e or other had taken Fire, they could not be of &s;o long la&s;ting or duration as we find them to be; and be&s;ides, we might as rea&s;onably expect, that all the Effluvia ari&s;ing at the &s;ame time from the &s;ame Body of Water, &s;hould equally be inflammable as the&s;e; and &s;o the whole Surface of the Pond, Lake, or River, appear all in a Flame at one time. The &s;udden motion of this Light from Place to Place, ve|ry much agrees with the Motion ob&s;ervable in Groups of Gnats, which move in a Body, &s;ometimes very &s;lowly, and at other times drive together with great &s;wiftne&s;s. Happening, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to di&s;cour&s;e upon this Subject with the ingenious Mr. <HI>Godfrey</HI> the Chy|mi&s;t, that Gentleman told me, that he had often ob|&s;erv'd this enlightned Body in &s;ome Places abroad, and had caught &s;ome of the In&s;ects which help'd to compo&s;e it. But allowing it to be as I &s;ay, the occa&s;ion of the Light in &s;uch In&s;ects remains yet to be di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="220">Of all the Accounts that I have had from Variety of People that have &s;een the&s;e Lights, and with which I could have fill'd a large Volume, I find no material difference in their &s;everal Relations; only that &s;ome, and indeed the mo&s;t, have &s;een them in watry and boggy Places, others have &s;een them in dry Grounds; to &s;ome the&s;e Lights appear'd of the bigne&s;s of that of a middling Candle (which mo&s;t agree in) to others bigger, and to &s;ome &s;maller. I &s;hall therefore add no other Relations but what follows, from the <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Meteor call'd the <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> from Ob|&s;ervations made in <HI>England</HI> by the Rev. Mr. <HI>W. Der|ham,</HI> F.R.S. and others in <HI>Italy,</HI> communicated by Sir <HI>Tho. Dereham,</HI> Bart. F.R.S. N^o. 411. p. 204. <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;act.</HI></P>
<P>It being the Opinion of divers skilful Naturali&s;ts (particularly Mr. <HI>Fran. Willughby</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ray</HI>) that the <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> are only the &s;hining of a great Num|ber of the Male Glo-worms in <HI>England,</HI> or of the <HI>Pyrau&s;tae</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> flying together: I was minded to con&s;ult my curious and ingenious Friend Sir <HI>Thomas Dereham</HI> about the Phaenomenon, being informed, that tho&s;e <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> are common in all the <HI>Italian</HI> Parts. But of the <HI>Pyrau&s;tae,</HI> or Fire-Flies, he &s;aith, he never ob&s;erved any &s;uch Effects, altho' there is an immen&s;e Number of them in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> He &s;aith moreover, that the&s;e <HI>Pyrau&s;tae</HI> are called <HI>Luccio|lae, i.e.</HI> &s;mall Lights; and that they are not the Far-falls (as Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> thought) which are Butterflies. But I have good rea&s;on to think, that In&s;ects are not concerned in the <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> from the following Ob&s;ervations; the fir&s;t of which I made my &s;elf,
<PB N="128" REF="221">and the others I received from <HI>Italy,</HI> by the Favour of Sir <HI>Tho. Dereham.</HI></P>
<P>My own Ob&s;ervations I made at a Place that lay in a Valley between rocky Hills, which I &s;u&s;pect might contain Minerals, in &s;ome boggy Ground near the bottom of tho&s;e Hills. Where &s;eeing one in a calm dark Night, with gentle Approaches I got up by degrees within two or three Yards of it, and viewed it with all the Care I po&s;&s;ibly could. I found it frisking about a dead Thi&s;tle growing in the Field, until a &s;mall Motion of the Air (even &s;uch as was cau&s;ed only by the Approximation of my &s;elf) made it skip to another place, and thence to another, and another.</P>
<P>It is now about fifty five Years &s;ince I &s;aw this Phaenomenon; but I have as fre&s;h and perfect an Idea of it, as if it was but a few Days. And as I took it then, &s;o I am of the &s;ame Opinion now, that it was a fired Vapour.</P>
<P>The Male Glo-worms I know emit their &s;hining Light as they fly; by which means they di&s;cover and woo their Females: but I never ob&s;erved them to fly together in &s;o great Numbers, as to make a Light equal to an <HI>Ignis Fatuus.</HI> And I was &s;o near, that had it been the &s;hining of Glo-worms, I mu&s;t have &s;een it in little di&s;tinct Spots of Light: but it was one continuous Body of Light.</P>
<P>Thus far the Doctor has related his own Ob&s;er|vation of an <HI>Ignis Fatuus.</HI> Before I mention the Ob&s;ervations which Sir <HI>Tho. Dereham</HI> procured for him in <HI>Italy;</HI> I cannot help remarking, that in the above Account the Dr. has given of an <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> there appears a much &s;tronger Argument of its be|ing
<PB N="129" REF="222">a living Creature, than a Vapour: For when with gentle Approaches he got up by degrees within two or three Yards of it, he found it frisking about a dead Thi&s;tle growing in the Field, until a &s;mall Motion of the Air (even &s;uch as was cau&s;ed only by his continual gentle approach) made it skip to ano|ther Place, and &s;o to another, and another. Its frisk|ing and playing about a Thi&s;tle, agrees much better with that of an In&s;ect, exerci&s;ed in &s;eeking its Food, or &s;ome other delightful Employment; as does its skipping from place to place likewi&s;e. For I can hardly think it po&s;&s;ible that the Air agitated only by his Body, con&s;idering how gently he approach'd the Light, could have been &s;ufficient &s;o to affect it, at two or three Yards di&s;tance, as to have driven it from him; but if this was really the Cau&s;e of its fir&s;t remove, its &s;econd, third, and after removes from place to place, mu&s;t be owing to &s;omething el&s;e: And as it was a calm Night, we cannot attribute its flight to the Wind; nor does the Doctor in the lea&s;t a&s;|&s;ign that as the Cau&s;e, any further than what pro|ceeded from his own &s;low ea&s;y Motion, which was to my thinking in&s;ufficient to effect it: Be&s;ides, if the Motion of the Air was the only Cau&s;e of this Light's moving from place to place; it could not be carried along in one continuous Body of Light, but would at lea&s;t be &s;pread, if not &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated: But an In&s;ect bu&s;ied in &s;eeking its Food, or &s;ome other Employment, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that as &s;oon as ever it perceived it&s;elf di&s;cover'd (which it might do by the help of its Light) it wou'd move off, in order to &s;ecure it&s;elf from any appearing danger: And this Solution of the Motion of the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> &s;eems
<PB N="130" REF="223">to me more agreeable to Truth than that of a Va|pour. And as to the Light's exceeding that which the Male Glo-worm emits flying; and that he never ob&s;erv'd them to fly together in &s;o great Numbers, as to make a Light equal to an <HI>Ignis Fatuus;</HI> there &s;eems good rea&s;on to believe, that all &s;hining Flies can at plea&s;ure add or dimini&s;h their Light, or per|haps the Light's being more or le&s;s, may be owing to the Size or Perfection of the Creature. But I be|lieve it is not a collective Body of &s;mall In&s;ects that compo&s;es the <HI>Ignis Fatuus;</HI> but rather one &s;ingle Animal, which of what Tribe it belongeth to, re|mains yet to be di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lanthorn-Fly</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;eems to be of the Papilionaceous kind; tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ay it is pro|duced from the In&s;ect <HI>Fig.</HI> 3. pag. 52. which agrees better with the Chafer or Beetle kind, than that of the Butter-fly. But whether the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> be of the Papilionaceous, Libella, Beetle-kind, or any other, in mu&s;t remain a Doubt, till time di&s;covers it: And all that is intended in this Attempt, is only to &s;how the probability of its being a living Animal, rather than a Vapour; becau&s;e many of the Circum&s;tances agree well with the former, and hardly one with the latter.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervations which Sir <HI>Tho. Dereham</HI> procur|ed for the Doctor in <HI>Italy</HI> agreeing in the general with mo&s;t other Relations, and the whole being too long to in&s;ert, I &s;hall only extract the Heads of what that Gentleman has deliver'd; and then leave the Argu|ment to &s;ome abler Hand, who&s;e Time and Abilities are better &s;uited to examine the Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="224">In <HI>Italy</HI> there are of the&s;e Lights both on the Mountains, and in the Plains; and are pretty com|mon in all the Territory of <HI>Bologna.</HI> To begin with the Plains: They are frequently ob&s;erved there; the Country People call them <HI>Cular&s;i;</HI> perhaps from &s;ome fancied Similitude to tho&s;e Birds, and becau&s;e they look upon them as Birds, the Belly and other Parts of which are re&s;plendent like our &s;hining Flies. They are mo&s;t frequent in watry and mora&s;&s;e Ground, and there are &s;ome &s;uch Places, where one may be almo&s;t &s;ure of &s;eeing them every Night, if it be dark. In the Fields near the Bridge <HI>Della Calcarata,</HI> in a Com|mon belonging to a Pari&s;h of S. <HI>Maria in dono,</HI> North of <HI>Bologna,</HI> one of the&s;e fiery Appearances is very often ob&s;erved to move acro&s;s the Fields, com|ing from another Bridge. There is another of them in the Fields of <HI>Bagnara,</HI> almo&s;t Ea&s;t of <HI>Bologna,</HI> which &s;carce ever fails to appear in dark Nights; particularly when it rains, or &s;nows, as al&s;o in cold and fro&s;ty Weather: Both the&s;e Lights are very large; that at <HI>Bagnara</HI> appeared to a Gentleman, as he was travelling that way; it kept him Company for a Mile or better; con&s;tantly moving before him, and ca&s;t|ing a &s;tronger Light on the Road than the Link he had with him.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;er ones there appear a good many, &s;ome of them giving as much Light as a lighted Torch, and &s;ome there are no bigger than the Flame of a com|mon Candle. All of them have the &s;ame Property, in re&s;embling both in Colour and Light, a Flame &s;trong enough to reflect a Lu&s;tre upon neighbouring Objects all around. They are continually in Motion, but this Motion is various and uncertain. Some|times they ri&s;e up, at others they &s;ink: &s;ometimes
<PB N="132" REF="225">they di&s;appear of a &s;udden, and appear again in an in&s;tant in &s;ome other Place. Commonly they keep hovering about &s;ix Feet from the Ground. As they differ in largene&s;s, &s;o they do in figure, &s;preading &s;ometimes pretty wide, and then again contracting them&s;elves: &s;ometimes breaking to all Appearance in two, and a very little while after meeting again into one Body; &s;ometimes floating like Waves, and letting drop &s;ome Parts like Sparks out of a Fire. I have been a&s;&s;ured, that there is no dark Night all the Year round when they do not appear. And in the very middle of the Winter, when the Weather is very cold, and the Ground cover'd with Snow, they are ob&s;erv|ed more frequently than in the hotte&s;t Summer. Nor doth Rain or Snow in any wi&s;e prevent or hinder their Appearance; on the contrary, they are more frequent|ly ob&s;erved, and ca&s;t a &s;tronger Light in rainy and wet Weather. Neither doth the Wind much hurt them, tho' one &s;hould think, that if it was a burning Sub&s;tance, like common Fire, it &s;hould either be di&s;|&s;ipated in windy Weather, or extingui&s;hed by Rain; (and the &s;ame we might expect if it was a Vapour.) But &s;ince they do not receive any damage from wet Weather, and &s;ince on the other hand it hath never been ob&s;erved, that any thing was thereby &s;et on Fire, tho' they mu&s;t needs in moving to and fro meet with a good many combu&s;tible Sub&s;tances; it may from thence be very rea&s;onably inferred, that they have &s;ome re&s;emblance to that &s;ort of Pho&s;phorus which doth indeed &s;hine in the dark, but doth not burn any thing, as common Fire doth. As to the appearance of this Phaenomenon in mountainous Parts, by what I have hitherto been able to learn, they differ in no|thing
<PB N="133" REF="226">el&s;e but in largene&s;s; and all tho&s;e I conver&s;ed with, that &s;aw them in the Mountains, agree in that they never ob&s;erved any larger than the Flame of an ordinary Candle. Nor do tho&s;e that live in the Moun|tains call them <HI>Cular&s;i,</HI> which Name is perhaps u&s;ed only by the Country People in the Plains, for tho&s;e large ones above de&s;cribed. One thing I will beg leave to add, that according to the be&s;t Informations I have been able to procure, the&s;e Lights are great Friends to Brooks and Rivers, being frequently ob|&s;erved along the Banks of them, perhaps becau&s;e the Air carries them thither more ea&s;ily than any where el&s;e. In all other particulars, as in their Motion, the manner of their Appearance, their di&s;appearing &s;ome|times very &s;uddenly, their Light, the Height they ri&s;e to, and their not being affected either by rainy or cold Weather, they are the very &s;ame with the <HI>Cular&s;i</HI> above de&s;cribed, or the large <HI>Will with a Whi&s;p,</HI> as ob&s;erved in the Plains.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman, a very accurate and knowing Ob&s;erver of Natural Appearances, travelling &s;ome time in the Month of <HI>March</HI> between eight and nine in the Evening, in a mountainous Road not far from our Lady <HI>Del &s;ar&s;o,</HI> about ten Miles South of <HI>Bolog|na,</HI> as he approach'd a certain River called <HI>Rioverde,</HI> he perceived a Light, which &s;hone very &s;trongly up|on &s;ome Stones that lay upon the Banks. It &s;eemed to be about two Feet above the Stones, and not far from the Water of the River: In figure and largene&s;s it had the Appearance of a Parallelopepid, &s;omewhat above a <HI>Bologne&s;e</HI> Foot in length, and about half a Foot high, its longe&s;t &s;ide lying parallel to the Ho|rizon: Its Light was very &s;trong, in&s;omuch that he could very plainly di&s;tingui&s;h by it part of a neighbour|ing Hedge, and the Water in the River; only in
<PB N="134" REF="227">the Ea&s;t corner of it the Light was pretty faint, and the &s;quare Figure le&s;s perfect, as if cut off, or dar|ken'd by the Segment of a Circle: The Gentleman's Curio&s;ity tempted him to examine it a little nearer; in order to which he advanced gently towards the Place, but was &s;urprized to find, that in&s;en&s;ibly it changed from a bright red to a yellowi&s;h, and then to a pale Colour, in proportion as he drew nearer; and that when he came to the Place it&s;elf, it was quite vani&s;hed. Upon this he &s;tepped back, and not only &s;aw it again, but &s;ound the farther he went from it, the &s;tronger and brighter it grew; nor could he upon narrowly viewing the Place where this fiery Appearance was, perceive the lea&s;t blackne&s;s, or &s;mell, or any Mark of an actual Fire. The &s;ame Ob&s;erva|tion was confirmed to me by another Gentleman who frequently travels that way, and who a&s;&s;ured me, that he had &s;een the very &s;ame Light five or fix different times, in Spring and Autumn, and that he had always ob&s;erved it in the very &s;ame Shape and the &s;ame Place; which to me &s;eems very difficult to be accounted for. He told me farther, that once he took particular notice of its coming out of a neigh|bouring Place, and then &s;ettling it&s;elf into the Figure above de&s;cribed. How it comes to pa&s;s, that the nearer one approaches to the&s;e, or the like fiery Ap|pearances, the fainter they grow, till at la&s;t they di&s;|appear totally, I freely own my &s;elf at a lo&s;s. This is the Sub&s;tance of what I have been able to gather from &s;everal Accounts relating to the <HI>Ignes Fatui;</HI> but as to the Cau&s;es of them I will not pretend to a&s;&s;ign any: I will only add, that all that ever &s;aw any of the&s;e fiery Appearances agree, and you may a&s;&s;ure Mr. <HI>Derham</HI> of it, that they ca&s;t a Light quite different from that of the &s;hining Flies; and if you
<PB N="135" REF="228">plea&s;e to reflect on the &s;everal Circum&s;tances above related, I believe you will find, that they are not ea|&s;ily, if at all, to be &s;olved by that Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Conclu&s;ion of Sir <HI>Tho. Dere|ham's,</HI> from the Circum&s;tances of his Relation, I am more &s;trongly inclin'd to believe the Light proceeds from a living Animal than I was before. For let any Per&s;on but examine the particulars of the Account Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> has given of the <HI>Ignes Fatui;</HI> and try how far he can reconcile them to the Appearance, or No|tion of a mere Vapour.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> he &s;ays, there are ob&s;erv'd two kinds of the&s;e Lights, one on the Mountains, the other in the Plains; tho&s;e in the Plains are the large&s;t. The Country People call them <HI>Calar&s;i,</HI> becau&s;e they look upon them as Birds, the Belly and other Parts of which are re&s;plendent like their &s;hining Flies; that is, their <HI>Pyrau&s;tae,</HI> or Fire-Flies, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>One of the&s;e fiery Appearances was often ob&s;erv'd to move acro&s;s the Fields, coming from one Bridge to a Spot of Ground near the other. Would a fired Vapour, think ye, be &s;o often rai&s;ed at the &s;ame Place, of the &s;ame &s;ize, and &s;o con&s;tantly go to the &s;ame Spot, and there fix it &s;elf? Can &s;uch an Ac|tion be reconcil'd to the Notion of a Vapour? Is it not more agreeable to that of Sen&s;e? It rather looks as as if &s;ome &s;hining Animal &s;allied out at &s;uch a time from its lurking Hole, or Place of retreat.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e larger Lights appear'd to a Gen|tleman as he was travelling, and kept him Company for a Mile or more, con&s;tantly moving before him. How a Vapour could do this, is beyond my Com|prehen&s;ion, or I believe any one's el&s;e. As to the different Magnitudes of this Light, that is undoubt|edly owing to the different Creatures that emit it,
<PB N="136" REF="229">or perhaps to the &s;ize or perfection of the In&s;ect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> appearing in a dark Night in any Weather, as Rain, Snow, and the like; at which times they are ob&s;erv'd to ca&s;t a &s;tronger Light; agree|eth much better with an Animal than a Vapour; be|cau&s;e the &s;hining Matter in an In&s;ect being enclos'd, can receive no damage from any kind of Weather: whereas a Vapour would either not be exhaled, or would &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated by the weight of the Rain, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But an In&s;ect at &s;uch a time &s;tands in need of more Light, and therefore di&s;plays its utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> that appear'd to the young Gentleman, in figure and &s;ize of a Parallelopepid, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> which Ob&s;ervation was confirmed by another Gen|tleman, who frequently travelled that way, that he had &s;een the very &s;ame Light five or &s;ix different times, in Spring and Autumn; and that he had al|ways ob&s;erved it in the very &s;ame &s;hape, and the &s;ame place; and that once he took particular Notice of its coming out of a neighbouring Place, and then &s;ettling it&s;elf into the figure above de&s;cribed; let any Per&s;on but duly con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances above re|lated, and (as I &s;aid before) try if they can be re|conciled to the Exi&s;tence and motion of a Vapour. Sir <HI>Tho. Dereham</HI> freely owns him&s;elf at a lo&s;s to account for this; as well he might in &s;uppo&s;ing it a meer fired Vapour. Mi&s;taken Notions, by skilful Advocates, are often made to appear like Truth; but Truth it&s;elf, though defended by far meaner Parts, generally carries a &s;tronger Conviction.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Account of an <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> I had from an intimate Friend, an Apothecary in <HI>London,</HI> &s;ince the foregoing Di&s;&s;ertation on this Sub|ject
<PB N="137" REF="230">was &s;ent to the Pre&s;s: Its confirming in a great mea&s;ure &s;ome things that I deliver'd as Conjectures on|ly, made me the more willing to in&s;ert it.</P>
<P>Him&s;elf, in company with two other Per&s;ons, &s;aw one of the&s;e Appearances in a Garden about nine of the Clock in a dark Night: They at fir&s;t imagin'd it &s;ome Country Fellow with a Lanthorn, till approaching within about &s;ix Yards, it &s;uddenly di&s;appeared; and in a &s;mall &s;pace of time appear'd in a dry Field, about thirty of forty Yards off. It di&s;appear'd as &s;uddenly a &s;econd time, and was &s;een again near an hundred Yards off; from thence it removed to a further di&s;|tance, and &s;o to a further; till at length they &s;pied it in another Field, parted from the fir&s;t by a thick Hedge, and &s;o from Field to Field. Whether it went over, or through the Hedge, could not be ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e it pa&s;&s;ed from one Field to the other whil&s;t dark.</P>
<P>This Gentleman told me he had &s;een this Light di|vers times afterwards; it always appeared the &s;ame, without any di&s;cernable difference either in bigne&s;s or figure, and that &s;everal other Per&s;ons had &s;een it like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Once he &s;aw this Appearance in a dry Field, fixed, without Motion; the &s;ame two Per&s;ons being with him that &s;aw it in the Garden the fir&s;t time, agreed to try how near they could get to it; and having ap|proach'd within ten or twelve Yards, one of the Per|&s;ons was for running to catch it; which ha&s;ty Pro|ceeding made it immediately vani&s;h: It appear'd again at little di&s;tances as before, but &s;eem'd to pack away as it were in a Fright.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;ervations were made at <HI>A&s;tley,</HI> &s;even Miles from <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI></P>
