<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD NORTH, <HI>&amp;c., &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Calcutta, <DATE>17th Sept. 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I TAKE it for granted that, whenever it &s;hall be thought advi&s;eable to form a new arrangement for the future govern|ment of Bengal, and for the general &s;e|curity of our acqui&s;itions and e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in India, on &s;ome determinate prin|ciple, and under an united authority, the &s;ub&s;tance of our public letters to the Court
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of Directors, and of the &s;everal minutes &s;igned by Sir John Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, as far as they may appear to relate to tho&s;e objects, will be duly con&s;idered. We &s;pared no pains to procure u&s;eful information, nor neglected any opportunity of communicating it to the Company and to Government; not confining our reflections to the particular &s;ubject before us, but extending them generally to the political intere&s;ts and in|ternal admini&s;tration of the country, as far as the occa&s;ion would permit; and I tru&s;t that, however our efforts, in other re&s;pects, may have been di&s;appointed of their immediate aim, the inquiries we made, and the knowledge obtained by them, will not be found u&s;ele&s;s to our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. To execute this part of the duty of our appointment as completely as I can, and to enable Government to take &s;uch mea&s;ures hereafter, for a final arrangement of India affairs, as may in|clude every ca&s;e fit to be provided for, and not be defeated in the execution, I beg leave to &s;ubmit to your Lord&s;hip &s;ome
<PB N="3" REF="5">
important que&s;tions, on which we have had no proper opportunity of delivering our opinion, and which, I pre&s;ume, cannot be left undecided at home, with|out great inconvenience to the public &s;er|vice here. Many of the&s;e que&s;tions are obvious, and will, without doubt, have already occurred to your Lord&s;hip. I think it nece&s;&s;ary, neverthele&s;s, not to pa&s;s by any point whatever, on which your Lord&s;hip might po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire an opinion or expect information from me.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t que&s;tion, in the &s;olution of which that of many others will be in|cluded, is of &s;o much importance, and united with political con&s;iderations &s;o re|mote from the immediate intere&s;ts of Bengal, that I do not pre&s;ume to &s;tate it in any other &s;hape, than &s;imply as a que&s;|tion; viz. <Q REND="inline">"To what extent and in what form the actual &s;overeignty of Great Britain over the&s;e provinces &s;hall be avowed?"</Q> A higher judgment than mine mu&s;t determine, whether any plan of mea&s;ures for the internal Government
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of Bengal can be perfectly regular, &s;y&s;te|matical, or &s;ecure, which does not &s;up|po&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h a unity of dominion. The operations of that power, de&s;cending from a &s;ingle &s;ource, would flow with regularity in their natural channels, and never cla&s;h with each other.</P>
<P N="3">3. In this ob&s;ervation, the object is con&s;idered as it &s;tands; a country, in which the principal branches of the &s;ove|reign power are exerci&s;ed by the Ea&s;t-India Company, where ju&s;tice is admi|ni&s;tered partly under the authority of the Subadar, and partly under that of the King of Great Britain, and where the na|tives in general acknowledge no King but the Mogul, who&s;e rights as Sovereign are admitted by all Indo&s;tan, under who&s;e authority the revenues are collected, and in who&s;e name the current money of Bengal is coined. The wi&s;dom of His Maje&s;ty's Council will determine, in what manner the&s;e &s;everal rights and powers can now be reconciled or adju&s;ted; or whether the actual condition of the object
<PB N="5" REF="7">
will admit of any in&s;titutions compleatly free from exception.</P>
<P N="4">4. If mea&s;ures, already taken, and the effects they have produced, had no influence on tho&s;e, which mu&s;t be pur|&s;ued hereafter, the &s;afe&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;im|ple, and the lea&s;t invidious principle, on which this territory could be held, would have been that of a fixed tribute from the native Prince of the country, an armed force &s;ufficient to in&s;ure his dependence, and one &s;trong po&s;t for &s;ecurity or retreat. On this principle, an interference in the internal Government would have defeated our own plan, and deprived us of the be|nefit of it. Acts of power, not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of the dominion, are mo&s;t felt by the conquered people, who, once &s;ubmitting to the dominion it&s;elf, will not repine at mea&s;ures indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve it. Such mea&s;ures do not invade the laws, religion, man|ners, or prejudices of the people. Obe|dience is their &s;ole object; and that Go|vernment will be be&s;t obeyed, under
<PB N="6" REF="8">
which the people are limited the lea&s;t in the enjoyment of their private rights. A wi&s;e Prince, who had made &s;uch a conque&s;t as Bengal, would probably have endeavoured to make this u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. By bringing this policy into view, I do not mean to propo&s;e it for pre&s;ent practi&s;e. Facts, not to be re&s;i&s;ted, oblige me to bani&s;h that idea. But, though the in&s;titution alluded to be in it&s;elf unattain|able, it does not follow that &s;ome of it's component principles may not be &s;elected and pre&s;erved in rai&s;ing another edifice.</P>
<P N="6">6. Circum&s;tances, in&s;eparable perhaps from the Con&s;titution of the Ea&s;t India Company, di&s;qualified them in every &s;en&s;e for the duty and office, which the acqui&s;ition of a territory in India impo&s;ed upon them. A body of merchants had intere&s;ts to provide for, be&s;ides tho&s;e, which belonged to them in their a&s;&s;umed character of Sovereign. Profit, being the only object of a trading company, became the &s;ole object of Government, when the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
two characters were united. Commercial principles of the wor&s;t quality, as derived from the Con&s;titution of an exclu&s;ive company, were all the principles, which the India Company brought with them into the Government of a great kingdom, and it has been governed accordingly. After rai&s;ing the revenues as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to the level of the rents, for the &s;upport of their <HI>Government,</HI> they mono|polized the produce and labour of the country for the &s;upport of their <HI>trade.</HI> To obtain the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible revenue from the land, they were obliged to avow or countenance a principle &s;ubver&s;ive of all national pro&s;perity, and not le&s;s fal&s;e in fact, than ab&s;urd in theory and dan|gerous in practice; <Q REND="inline">"that the ruling power was proprietor of the &s;oil."</Q> On this principle, they univer&s;ally di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the hereditary and lawful owners, and farmed the country to &s;trangers. In a few in&s;tances, where the proprietors were employed, it was not in their true cha|racter, but as farmers of Government. There is no example, I believe, of &s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="10">
an act of power in the Hi&s;tory of In|do&s;tan.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Company's &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have no view but the advantage of the body corporate, mu&s;t have ruined Bengal, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their &s;ervants, though not in &s;o &s;hort a pe|riod. <Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu:</NOTE>Of all de&s;potic governments, there is none which oppre&s;&s;es it&s;elf more than where the prince declares him&s;elf proprietor of the &s;oil, and heir of all his &s;ubjects. It always follows, that the cultivation of the earth is abandoned; but if, be&s;ides this, the prince is a merchant, every &s;pecies of indu&s;try is ruined."</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. The internal juri&s;dictions of the country fell with the rights of the Ze|mindars, who were naturally, and by in|&s;titution, the magi&s;trates of the people in the ordinary detail of ju&s;tice, and an|&s;werable for the peace of their re&s;pective
<PB N="9" REF="11">
Zemindaries. Great ca&s;es were re&s;erved for the deci&s;ion of the prince.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is true that no attempt has been made to interrupt the natives in the ex|erci&s;e of their religion, much le&s;s to give them an idea of a better. The &s;pi|rit of per&s;ecution or conver&s;ion is foreign from the Engli&s;h character; nor could any additional profit have been derived from it. But the decline of the Zemin|dars has, in a great mea&s;ure, deprived the lower cla&s;&s;es of one of their princi|pal enjoyments&mdash;the &s;hews, proce&s;&s;ions, and pageantry of a ceremonious &s;uper|&s;tition; at the &s;ame time that the &s;ources, out of which many charitable and reli|gious in&s;titutions were &s;upported, have been reduced or annihilated.</P>
<P N="10">10. Your Lord&s;hip will &s;oon perceive how much it is the general object of this repre&s;entation to e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion, that, to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bengal beneficial and permanent, we &s;hould re|vert to the ancient in&s;titutions of the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
country, as far as we are acquainted with them, and pre&s;ent circum&s;tances will permit. If it were not for the expe|rience of &s;ome years pa&s;t, it might be &s;uperfluous to &s;ay, that we provide for our <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> when we con&s;ult the happi|ne&s;s and pro&s;perity of the people, who labour for us.</P>
<P N="11">11. It appears to have been the Com|pany's original policy, or that of Lord Clive, to govern the&s;e provinces through the medium of the Subadar, and the be&s;t they could adopt, &s;uppo&s;ing them to in|terpo&s;e in any &s;hape in the internal go|vernment. This &s;y&s;tem was &s;oon vio|lated in fact, and not long afterwards avowedly renounced. The predominant power of the Council at Calcutta nece&s;|&s;arily reduced the Subadar to a cypher, and left him and his &s;ubjects, as it always will do, a prey to individuals. Forms and appearances were, however, in &s;ome degree, pre&s;erved till the death of Syef-ul-Dowla in 1770. From that period we &s;ee nothing in the admini&s;tration of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
public affairs but enormous abu&s;es on one &s;ide, and an ab&s;olute want of power or per&s;everance to correct them on the other. But the&s;e are topics, on which I need not enlarge. Occa&s;ional acts of vigour, on the part of the Court of Directors, were little felt or regarded in Bengal, and neither did nor could pro|duce any la&s;ting improvement in the conduct of their repre&s;entatives. Abu&s;es, which belong to the nature of the thing, and ri&s;e directly out of it, are not to be corrected by regulations, even if the profe&s;&s;ed intentions of the Court of Di|rectors had been con&s;tantly and &s;incerely &s;upported. The Company's government was founded on a falfe and cla&s;hing principle, and would, at all events, have produced the effects it has done, though perhaps by &s;lower gradations. A fortu|nate choice of men, and a firm admini|&s;tration, might have checked the rapid growth of abu&s;es, and delayed the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of an entire change of &s;y&s;tem to a remoter period. Under the Company's government, even this ca&s;ual re&s;ource was
<PB N="12" REF="14">
not to be expected. Their &s;ervants could not ri&s;e to high &s;ituations without hav|ing &s;pent their youth in the &s;ervice. Their minds, in general, unprepared by education, and &s;oftened by the climate, were open to the impre&s;&s;ions of example. The extraordinary temptations, to which almo&s;t every degree of power in this country is expo&s;ed, has too direct a ten|dency to corrupt the hand, to which it is intru&s;ted. But temptation is converted into nece&s;&s;ity, or may plau&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame colours, when high &s;tations are not united with avowed emoluments pro|portioned to them. Among other maxims, which belonged to the Company's com|mercial in&s;titutions, and which they transferred to their political government, one was, not to allow their &s;ervants directly even a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. On this principle they treated mini&s;ters of &s;tate and rulers of provinces as they had done clerks and factors. They were them|&s;elves too powerful to be ju&s;t, and neither did nor could rea&s;onably expect that their &s;ervants would not follow their
<PB N="13" REF="15">
example. It was in vain, therefore, that they &s;ometimes endeavoured or pretended to reconcile regularity and ju&s;tice, in the detail of their admini&s;tration, with inju&s;tice in its fundamental principle&mdash;I mean that of uniting the character of Sovereign and merchant, and exerci&s;ing the power of the fir&s;t for the benefit of the &s;econd.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu 5, 14.</NOTE>A government cannot be unju&s;t without having hands to exerci&s;e its inju&s;tice. Now it is im|po&s;&s;ible but the&s;e hands will be gra&s;p|ing for them&s;elves. Peculation, there|fore, is natural in de&s;potic &s;tates."</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. The Subadar's authority, &s;ince the Company's acceptance of the Dewanny, has been gradually reduced under three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nabobs, and is now merely titular in the per&s;on of Mobarek-ul-Dowla. The admini&s;tration of criminal ju&s;tice is, however, &s;till exerci&s;ed, in his name, by the Naib Suba, Mahomed
<PB N="14" REF="16">
Riza Cawn; and we &s;ometimes avail our&s;elves of the pretence of his authority in our differences with the foreign fac|tories. Dive&s;ted of all power, and wholly dependent on the Company's plea&s;ure, he has neverthele&s;s &s;uch rights and claims to plead as may embarra&s;s any new arrangement, in which the office of Subadar is not included. His &s;ituation, and the difficulties likely to ari&s;e out of it, de&s;erve to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="13">13. By the treaty concluded between him and the Company, in March, 1770, they engage to &s;ecure the Subahdarry to him, and to &s;upport him in it, again&s;t all his enemies. They al&s;o engage to pay him an annual &s;tipend of thirty-two lacks out of the revenues. The admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in his name, is an acknowledgement of his authority as repre&s;entative of the Sovereign. The Company approved of pre&s;erving the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the family of Meer Jaffier, but ordered his &s;tipend to be reduced to
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;ixteen lacks a year <HI>during his minority</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">10th April, 1771.</NOTE>. It is not determined at what period the minority is to end, nor by what autho|rity the Company could reduce the &s;tipend fixed by the treaty. The Nabob has been marriageable &s;ome years, and has &s;everal children. His age admits of no pretence to con&s;ider him as a minor; nor, if it did, would the Company, in their a&s;&s;umed quality of guardian, be the le&s;s accountable to him for the &s;avings created by the reduction of his &s;tipend. We have yet received no in&s;tructions what&s;oever on this &s;ubject. The Nabob does not &s;ubmit, without reluctance, to the re&s;traints laid upon him. I have rea&s;on to believe that he has made private applications to the Governor, and may repeat them to the Board, for the remo|val of Mahomed Riza Cawn, and to be allowed the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of whatever rights are left him. He may then demand the full amount and arrears of his pen&s;ion; and it is not unlikely
<PB N="16" REF="18">
that, failing of relief from Government, he may be advi&s;ed to in&s;titute a &s;uit again&s;t the Company in the Supreme Court of Judicature. If the deci&s;ion &s;hould be favourable to him, the Com|pany, I take it for granted, will throw the burden on the territorial revenues, notwith&s;tanding they have appropriated the &s;avings, already made by the reduc|tion of his &s;tipend, to the provi&s;ion of their inve&s;tment.</P>
<P N="14">14. With re&s;pect to the Nabob, the principal points to be determined are, Fir&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"Whether the office of Subahdar &s;hall be continued, and on what foot|ing?"</Q> Secondly, <Q REND="inline">"At what period the Nabob's minority is to end?"</Q> Thirdly, <Q REND="inline">"What mea&s;ures are to be taken in the ca&s;e of his death?"</Q>&mdash;Mahomed Riza Cawn's conduct, in his &s;tation of Naib Subah, has been hitherto unexceptionable; but it is not to be ex|pected that he &s;hould act with freedom, or be able to render us any e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice, while the terror of the Governor's
<PB N="17" REF="19">
actual power and of a cla&s;hing juri&s;dic|tion with the Supreme Court is hanging over him.</P>
<P N="15">15. In &s;ixing the future e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Subahdar and Naib Subah, it mu&s;t be taken into con&s;ideration that the circulation of their pen&s;ions is beneficial to the country; that they &s;upport a number of Mu&s;&s;ulman families of di&s;|tinction, which would be reduced to beggary if the pen&s;ions were withdrawn; and that the Fouzdarry Courts, now under Mahomed Reza Cawn, compre|hend almo&s;t all the offices, in which Mu&s;|&s;ulmen can be employed.</P>
<P N="16">16. The &s;overeignty a&s;&s;umed might authori&s;e His Maje&s;ty to remove the Subahdar; but I know not on what prin|ciple the Mogul Shaw Allum can be di|ve&s;ted of his &s;overeign rights, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;atisfactory compromi&s;e can be made with him. The Company hold the De|wanny by his grant. The treaty con|cluded by Lord Clive in Augu&s;t, 1765,
<PB N="18" REF="20">
not only acknowledges him as King of Bengal, but <HI>&s;ecures to him the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Korah and Illahabad as a royal deme&s;ne for the &s;upport of his dignity and expences;</HI> and by a particular agreement between him and the Company, of the &s;ame date, they engage them&s;elves to be &s;ecurity for the payment of twenty-&s;ix lacks a year, out of the territorial revenues, <HI>in con&s;ideration of</HI> His Maje&s;ty's having been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant them the Dewanny of Bengal. Your Lord&s;hip knows how little the&s;e treaties have been regarded: his tribute was &s;topt, and his country (though avowedly entru&s;ted to our good faith, and accepted as a depo&s;it) &s;old to Sujah Dowla.</P>
<P N="17">17. It was invariably the opinion of Sir John Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, that the honour of the na|tion required that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done to the Mogul in &s;ome &s;hape or other, and that it might be made conducive to our intere&s;t to &s;upport him. Con&s;idering his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, it would not per|haps
<PB N="19" REF="21">
be very difficult to form a plan, in which his &s;atisfaction, and the general tranquillity of the empire, might be equally con&s;ulted.</P>
<P N="18">18. After the internal &s;ettlement of our own territories, the next object &s;hould be to lay the foundation of a general peace thro' Indo&s;tan, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to give or re&s;tore an active con|&s;titution to the empire. Bengal cannot flouri&s;h while the neighbouring &s;tates are perpetually in arms again&s;t each other. Returns of wealth are not to be obtained from nations, which have no in|du&s;try of their own, or that langui&s;h under the dominion of the &s;word. As the fir&s;t &s;tep to peace, the authority of the Emperor &s;hould be in a con&s;iderable degree re&s;tored, and means given him to &s;upport it. In return for an acquittance of his claims upon the Company, a re&s;pec|table deme&s;ne might be found for him out of the countries lying north-we&s;t of Oude, of which Delhy might be the center. This &s;tep might lead to and fa|cilitate
<PB N="20" REF="22">
a general pacification, in which the rights of every &s;ubordinate power might be determined, and to which they &s;hould all be invited to accede. The predominant power of the Engli&s;h &s;hould be employed to cut through difficulties, and to guarantee the ob&s;ervance of the treaty. As far at lea&s;t as the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch a plan may be attainable by nego|ciation, it certainly de&s;erves to be en|couraged from home, and recommended to the Admini&s;tration here.</P>
<P N="19">19. The Briti&s;h power is now un|que&s;tionably the fir&s;t in India; at lea&s;t for defence. To make it re&s;pectable in it|&s;elf and beneficial to mankind, it mu&s;t be guided by &s;olid, judicious principles of policy, and they mu&s;t be &s;teadily pur&s;ued. Enough has been done to e&s;tabli&s;h the reputation of our arms. If we mean to keep what we have acquired, &s;ome care mu&s;t be taken to e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion of our &s;teadine&s;s and ju&s;tice. A continued divi&s;ion in this council, be|&s;ides many other dangerous effects, pro|duces
<PB N="21" REF="23">
one which, I conceive, would have had great weight at home, if it had been fore&s;een and con&s;idered. It expo&s;es the mea&s;ures of Government, which, at lea&s;t in every fundamental point, ought to be fixed and uniform, to perpetual altera|tions, as the actual power may acciden|tally fluctuate from one &s;ide to the other. The death of Colonel Mon&s;on produced not only a change of Admini&s;tration, but a total change of &s;y&s;tem. The death of Mr. Ha&s;tings or Mr. Barwell might have re&s;tored the cour&s;e of public mea&s;ures to their former channel. Other ca&s;es may now be fore&s;een, in which a future ma|jority may neither revert deci&s;ively to <HI>our</HI> principles, nor completely execute the re&s;olutions of their immediate prede|ce&s;&s;ors. The event will depend on the temper, character, and views of the men who compo&s;e it, and the new difficulties they may have to contend with. Dimi|nution of dignity is not to be &s;eparated from a fluctuation of councils; but changes of &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hake the foundation, are never accompli&s;hed with|out
<PB N="22" REF="24">
extraordinary difficulty and hazard; nor is it always open to the wi&s;e&s;t men to do perfectly right after much wrong has been done. A new po&s;ition of things creates a new que&s;tion, in which facts, as well as principles, mu&s;t govern the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P N="20">20. The pre&s;ent condition of the Na|bob of Oude, and the &s;tate of his do|minions, is the principal in&s;tance to which this rea&s;oning is meant to be ap|plied. Your Lord&s;hip will &s;oon &s;ee what an important &s;hare belongs to it in the political intere&s;ts of Bengal.</P>
<P N="21">21. On the death of the late Sujah Dowla, Mr. Ha&s;tings delivered a formal opinion to the Council, and afterwards to the Court of Directors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;ultations, 14th September, 1775.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"that we could not with ju&s;tice make any fur|ther demands upon his &s;ucce&s;&s;or."</Q> He admitted, <Q REND="inline">"that the treaty concluded by Mr. Bri&s;tow was <HI>very advantageous</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25">
to the Company,"</Q> but he recom|mended <Q REND="inline">"that their orders might be &s;uch as might tend to conciliate the mind of the Nabob, and to remove the apprehen&s;ion of any future in|croachments on his dominions."</Q></P>
<P N="22">22. The arguments, which prevailed with a majority of the Board again&s;t the fir&s;t opinion of Mr. Ha&s;tings, appear at large on our proceedings. We re&s;olved, that the engagements which had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between Sujah Dowla and the Company were per&s;onal, and expired with him. On this principle, denied by Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Barwell, and &s;ince di&s;avowed by the Company, (who have availed them&s;elves of the con&s;equences derived from it,) the treaty of Fyzabad with the pre&s;ent Nabob of Oude was concluded in May 1775. The terms of it were as favourable to us as our real intere&s;t demanded, and more &s;o than could have been obtained in other cir|cum&s;tances. In return for the ce&s;&s;ion of Ghazipore we granted him nothing but
<PB N="24" REF="26">
a guarantee of the dominions originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his father, with an expre&s;s exclu&s;ion of his late conque&s;ts. For the defence of the&s;e dominions, we agreed to continue a brigade in his &s;ervice, but obliged him to make a con&s;iderable ad|dition to the former &s;ub&s;idy. His own undi&s;ciplined troops were, however, a greater burthen to him, and drained all his re&s;ources without the po&s;&s;ibility of doing him any &s;ervice. To leave his army on this footing was, in effect, to expo&s;e him and his country to de&s;truc|tion; and he was &s;en&s;ible of it. The re&s;olution to &s;upply him with a moderate number of Briti&s;h officers was &s;ub&s;e|quent to the treaty. A corps of thirteen battalions of &s;epoys, and three regiments of cavalry, was formed out of his di&s;|orderly troops, and put under the com|mand of the&s;e officers; but it was &s;till <HI>his</HI> army. A con&s;iderable number of the re&s;t were reduced. This was the utmo&s;t extent of the interpo&s;ition of our Govern|ment in the Nabob's affairs; and at this point we were determined to &s;top. The
<PB N="25" REF="27">
internal admini&s;tration of his country might be expo&s;ed to abu&s;es, but we were perfectly &s;ure that they would never be corrected by our taking charge of it.</P>
<P N="23">23. Since the power of this Council devolved to Mr. Ha&s;tings, other ideas have prevailed. The recall of Mr. Bri&s;|tow and the appointment of Mr. Mid|dleton were the fir&s;t &s;teps to the new &s;y&s;tem. An entire change of conduct towards the Nabob was talked of very &s;oon after colonel Mon&s;on's death. I know not by what &s;ecret motives Mr. Ha&s;tings has been guided, nor how far the anxiety of his mind and the delicacy of his &s;ituation may have influenced his con|duct, at points of time when apparently it was too late to deliberate. The noto|rious fact is, that in all his late arrange|ments of the Nabob's government, he has re&s;olved ha&s;tily and executed &s;lowly. The re&s;olution to transfer the Nabob's troops under Briti&s;h officers to the Com|pany's e&s;tabli&s;hment, did not appear till May la&s;t, though it was publicly known
<PB N="26" REF="28">
&s;everal months before; and near three months more have been &s;uffered to elap&s;e before the new officers were appointed. General Clavering's remon&s;trances and mine again&s;t the mea&s;ure were &s;carcely li&s;tened to, though accompanied with urgent and repeated repre&s;entations to Mr. Ha&s;tings, not to neglect the defence of Bengal, while he was providing for that of Rohilcund and other di&s;tant coun|tries, in which the Company had no concern. In a few days after, the Go|vernor re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t on the Nabob's di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome per&s;ons in his &s;ervice who were obnoxious to us, and on his committing the internal admini&s;tration, without re&s;erve, to a Mini&s;ter named by the Board. The next &s;tep was, to offer the Company's protection to Sadut Ally, the Nabob's brother, who had fled from his court, and was the immediate object of his jealou&s;y, and to invite him to re|&s;ide within the&s;e provinces. By the late&s;t letters from Mr. Middleton it appears, that, under pretence of &s;ecuring the Company's debt, he has taken the col|lection
<PB N="27" REF="29">
of the greate&s;t part of the re|venues into his own hands.</P>
<P N="24">24. The re&s;ult is, that the Nabob is reduced to a cypher, that all power is ve&s;ted in Mr. Middleton, that the coun|try, delivered up to aliens, who neither under&s;tand its intere&s;ts nor have any con|cern for its pro&s;perity, is falling into ir|retrievable ruin, that the revenues have long been unequal to the expences, and that nothing is collected but by military execution. On this footing it cannot la&s;t long. The per&s;onal character of the Nabob offers no re&s;ource again&s;t the con|tinuance of &s;uch mi&s;chiefs. I fear he has neither virtue nor capacity to make a proper u&s;e of power, if power was re|&s;tored to him; certainly not, in circum|&s;tances which demand an extraordinary proportion of both. Such is the &s;ituation we &s;tand in at pre&s;ent. On the 4th of Augu&s;t, when Mr. Ha&s;tings recom|mended the appointment of the new of|ficers, he was plea&s;ed to declare, that <Q REND="inline">"if the admini&s;tration of the Company's
<PB N="28" REF="30">
affairs &s;hould finally re&s;t in other hands, what he now did would be of little con&s;equence, as it would be undone of cour&s;e, and the whole &s;y&s;|tem, of which it was but a part, an|nulled on the principles on which it was oppo&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P N="25">25. Without admitting the nece&s;&s;ity of this conclu&s;ion from any act or decla|ration of ours, and deeming it highly unju&s;tifiable to carry mea&s;ures of &s;uch importance into execution under any ex|pectation of their being &s;peedily rever&s;ed, I am compelled to confe&s;s, that the whole &s;tate of facts taken together con|&s;titutes a que&s;tion beyond the reach of any degree of wi&s;dom exi&s;ting in Bengal. We &s;hall probably be governed by events for a &s;hort period, and, I fear, obliged to abandon the country at the end of it.</P>
<P N="26">26. Before your attention is drawn di|rectly to Bengal, permit me to &s;tate to your Lord&s;hip one que&s;tion more, in which the general &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="29" REF="31">
empire in India is concerned. The con|trolling power, ve&s;ted by Parliament in this Government over the other Pre&s;i|dencies, is either not exten&s;ive enough, or not defined with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es intended by it. We have not only met with &s;light and di&s;obedience, in the exerci&s;e of our au|thority in India, but I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that the Court of Directors them&s;elves &s;eem to view it with jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t. Your Lord&s;hip cannot but be apprized of the &s;upport they have given to the Pre|&s;idency of Bombay, in oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved on here, for concluding a peace with the Mahrat|tas. In their letter of the 24th of De|cember la&s;t, paragraph 45, they charge us with exceeding our lawful authority, when we prohibited the Pre&s;idency of Madras from &s;ending troops out of their own di&s;tricts to aid the &s;ettlement of Bom|bay, and they di&s;approve our interference in that ca&s;e. I apprehend that the power of declaring and making war includes that of determining in what quarter it
<PB N="30" REF="32">
&s;hall be conducted with the greate&s;t ge|neral advantage, and pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But every arrangement of ours may be defeated, if the other Pre&s;idencies are permitted to alter the di&s;po&s;ition of their re&s;pective forces, without our con&s;ent, and of cour&s;e without regard to any ge|neral plan of operations. Whether this ob&s;ervation be well or ill founded, it is plain that the Court of Directors &s;ought for an occa&s;ion to limit our authority, and to di&s;countenance us in the eyes of the other Pre&s;idencies. The fact in que&s;|tion was of too old a date, and of too little moment in it&s;elf, to be revived for any other purpo&s;e. In their letter of the 5th February la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paragraphs 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</NOTE>, they cen&s;ure us for relinqui&s;hing &s;ome of the ce&s;&s;ions made by Ragoba in his treaty with the Pre&s;i|dency of Bombay, concluded (&s;everal months after our arrival in Bengal) not only without our con&s;ent and approba|tion, but without our knowledge. They al&s;o in&s;truct us to take advantage of any
<PB N="31" REF="33">
failure, on the part of the Mahratta Go|vernment, in the execution of the late treaty with them, and to renew the al|liance with Ragoba, on the &s;ame terms which the Pre&s;idency of Bombay had ob|tained from him. It is but too probable that, with &s;o much encouragement from home, the Governor and Council of Bombay may &s;oon find pretences for re|&s;uming their favourite projects, and in|volve us in a general war with the Mah|rattas. Whether that con&s;equence fol|lows or not, your Lord&s;hip will judge, from the&s;e in&s;tances, how ineffectual and hazardous any endeavours of ours mu&s;t be to pre&s;erve the peace of India, as long as the determination of peace and war is &s;ubjected to a cla&s;hing juri&s;diction. If it was the original intention of the Legi&s;la|ture, that the whole force of the Briti&s;h empire in India &s;hould be united under one direction, and move together, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit my opinion to your Lord&s;hip, that other provi&s;ions, more &s;trict and deci&s;ive than any that exi&s;t at pre&s;ent, are indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to carry that intention
<PB N="32" REF="34">
into effect. The latitude &s;till left with the other Pre&s;idencies, to make peace and war, <HI>where they &s;hall have received &s;pecial orders from the Company,</HI> without any communication with us, or control on our part, defeats the general view of uniting the political mea&s;ures of the three Governments under one &s;y&s;tem and au|thority; becau&s;e the exception mu&s;t al|ways be too powerful for the rule.</P>
<P N="27">27. I have already, in my repre&s;enta|tions to the Company, declared my opi|nion &s;o fully on many of the mo&s;t im|portant branches of the internal Admini|&s;tration of Bengal, that very little remains for me to &s;ay on this &s;ubject. With re|&s;pect to the amount and collection of the revenues, the Court of Directors and Government are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the lights and materials, I have been able to collect; and the&s;e, I hope, will enable them to determine, on what footing the land tax of the country &s;hall be &s;ettled hereafter. The principal que&s;tions are, whether the lands &s;hall be re&s;tored to the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
hereditary owners. Whether the reve|nue, payable to Government, &s;hall be fixed immutably at a certain &s;um, and by what rule or &s;tandard that &s;um &s;hall be a&s;certained. To the two fir&s;t que&s;tions I have invariably given an affirmative an&s;wer, founded on rea&s;ons, which I deem incontrovertible. The third mu&s;t be determined by the capacity of the country, e&s;timated from an average of the actual collections, and combined with the indi&s;pen&s;ible demands of Govern|ment.</P>
<P N="28">28. The farming &s;y&s;tem was adopted as the act of a proprietor, with a profe&s;&s;ed view of di&s;covering the ultimate value of the e&s;tate, or the utmo&s;t that could be obtained from it. Your Lord&s;hip will judge, how far the end, &s;uppo&s;ing it at|tainable, could ju&s;tify the means. To General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, it always appeared an arbi|trary, unexampled act of power, with|out a &s;hadow of right to &s;upport it. The principle, on which it went, annihilated
<PB N="34" REF="36">
every idea of private property, while in fact it has been ruinous to the country, for the &s;ole benefit of the Company's &s;er|vants, and their banians. But, even if the farms had, in every in&s;tance, been fairly allotted to the highe&s;t bidders, the mea&s;ure could have produced no other con&s;equence, than that of forcibly alienat|ing the whole landed property of the country, in favour of indigent &s;trangers and adventurers, equally ignorant of the value and circum&s;tances of the farm, and carele&s;s how much they offered for immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The la&s;t &s;ettle|ment, made by the Committee of Circuit, promi&s;ed an immoderate increa&s;e of reve|nue, at a time, when the famine had &s;wept away one third of the inhabitants, and when the country was repre&s;ented to be in a general &s;tate of decay. Extraor|dinary merit was pleaded with the Com|pany for this imaginary addition to their re&s;ources. What the real object of the mea&s;ure was, may be collected from the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The balances and remi&s;|&s;ions, on the &s;ettlements of the la&s;t five
<PB N="35" REF="37">
years, amount to the enormous &s;um of two hundred and thirty lacks of Sicca ru|pees. The plain truth is, that overrate|ment and remi&s;&s;ion play into each other's hands. If the country be exorbitantly taxed, the Governor and Council <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be tru&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power to make remi&s;&s;ions. This latitude once given or a&s;&s;umed, it may be impo&s;&s;ible to determine in what manner it is applied, or where the remi&s;&s;ions center at la&s;t; &s;ince the di&s;tribution may be &s;o formed, as to intere&s;t all parties in concealing it. If we had no facts or experience to guide our conjectures, it is apparent that a country, expo&s;ed to arbitrary variations in the annual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, at the di&s;cre|tion of a Council of State, e&s;pecially at this immen&s;e di&s;tance from the &s;eat of empire, offers temptations to the Mem|bers of &s;uch a Council, which will not be always re&s;i&s;ted. Improvements, in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, are not to be ex|pected; for who will employ his money or his labour in the cultivation of a &s;oil, that does not belong to him, or when he
<PB N="36" REF="38">
has no &s;ecurity that the whole produce may not be extorted from him by a new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment? The wealth of Bengal was &s;o great, that the &s;evere&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion has not yet been &s;ufficient to beggar it intirely. But the riche&s;t mines may be exhau&s;ted; and I am mo&s;t deliberately of opinion that if private property be not once for all &s;e|cured on a permanent footing, the public revenue will &s;ink rapidly with the general produce of the country. The &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of taxation, which annihilates the pro|perty, attacks the indu&s;try of the &s;ubject, invades the &s;ources of production, and in the end obliges Government to depend for it's revenue on the fidelity of farmers and agents, who have no intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the object, or on the preca|rious, peri&s;hable re&s;ources of direct vio|lence and extortion.</P>
<P N="29">29. The la&s;t orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General letter, 5th Feb. 1777, par. 15.</NOTE> of the Court of Directors are favourable to the Zemindars, and other hereditary proprietors of the

In a ca&s;e, deter|minable by fixed general rules, it is equally un&s;afe and unnece&s;&s;ary to rely on accidental motives of action, &s;uch as the firmne&s;s, ability, or integrity of the per|&s;ons intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration. What <HI>real</HI> appeal have the natives of Bengal to the directing Power in Eng|land, again&s;t acts &s;uppo&s;ed to be beneficial to that Power, and adorned with flatter|ing repre&s;entations, in which ju&s;tice and
<PB N="38" REF="40">
profit are apparently united? Your Lord|&s;hip will judge by what &s;ort of tenure the natives hold their property, while the <HI>convenience</HI> of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany, and the di&s;cretion of the rulers here, are to regulate the &s;tandard by which it is to be taxed. The conclu&s;ion, to which this argument leads, is too ob|vious to be mi&s;taken. If I am not greatly deceived, the truths I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h are &s;elf-evident, and proved the moment they are &s;tated.</P>
<P N="30">30. The annual demand of revenue, once fixed on a rea&s;onable and permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, would operate to the be|nefit of the country in other &s;en&s;es, be|&s;ides that of immediate relief, &s;ecurity, and improvement. It would &s;top one of the principal &s;ources of litigation, and facilitate the admini&s;tration of civil ju&s;tice by the country Courts. The weight of the revenue pre&s;&s;es &s;o heavily on almo&s;t all ranks of people, that it becomes every man's &s;tudy how to &s;hift the burden from him&s;elf, and of cour&s;e to hara&s;s his neigh|bour.
<PB N="39" REF="41">
Let the cau&s;e of action be what it may, it &s;eldom happens that the public revenue is not, &s;ome way or other, con|cerned in the origin of the &s;uit, or liable to be affected by the i&s;&s;ue. On the other hand, the introduction of a my&s;terious &s;cience, under the title of the Farming Sy&s;tem, with its endle&s;s train of princi|pal farmers, nominal farmers, &s;ecurities, counter &s;ecurities, agents, and cutkin|nadars, has not only perplexed the bu&s;i|&s;ine&s;s of the collections, but increa&s;ed the number of &s;uits in the Dewanny Courts, and the difficulty of deciding them. This difficulty is &s;o great, and the cau&s;es de|termined are &s;o few, in compari&s;on with the multitude that remain unheard, that, in reality, it amounts to a general denial of ju&s;tice. The little that is done, per|haps, is too often mixed with motives of influence or favour. If the revenue were once fixed on a moderate footing, and the people made tolerably ea&s;y in their cir|cum&s;tances, the &s;pirit of litigation mu&s;t gradually &s;ub&s;ide. At the &s;ame time, the di&s;putes between Government and the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
proprietors of the lands, and of the latter with their under-tenants and ryots, would either vani&s;h entirely, or admit of an ea&s;y and &s;ummary deci&s;ion. The amount of the rents being unalterably &s;ettled, would reduce the pre&s;ent intricate accounts of demands, receipts, and balances, to a &s;imple account current, the balance of which might be authenticated beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a di&s;pute. It mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood, however, that proper mea&s;ures are taken by Government to extend the plan of fixing the rents, to every cla&s;s of people concerned in paying them. In other words, that the &s;ame &s;ecurity, which Government gives to the tenant in chief, &s;hould, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, de&s;cend to the under-tenants in their &s;everal grada|tions, &s;o that every rank of &s;ociety, and every member of it, may have &s;omething to call his own. A great part of this bu|&s;ine&s;s, which &s;eems difficult and perplex|ed in the detail, will gradually execute it&s;elf, when once it is perceived, that a wi&s;e and &s;olid &s;y&s;tem is adopted at the Fountain-Head, and &s;teadily adhered to.

This Court &s;hould be placed under the &s;uperintendance of an Engli&s;h gentleman, properly quali|fied, with &s;ufficient appointments, under an oath to act faithfully, and not remov|able during his good behaviour. He &s;hould have Judges of the Hindoo and Mahomedan laws to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and his deci&s;ions, under a certain amount, &s;hould be final.

I mean only to trace the out|lines of a clear and &s;imple plan for the benefit of the natives, not re&s;ident in Calcutta, and would recommend that the execution or improvement of it &s;hould be referred to the Governor and Council here, with power to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch in&s;ti|tutions as they may deem advi&s;eable, and to put them in force, until farther orders can be received from England. But, in whatever hands it may be thought fit to place the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, I am clearly and immoveably of opinion, that the con&s;titution and manners of the natives, fixed as they are to the &s;oil which gave them birth, and never to be remov|ed from it without the &s;evere&s;t oppre&s;|&s;ion, do indi&s;pen&s;ibly require that ju&s;tice &s;hould be carried home to their doors. My wi&s;h is to revert, as nearly as po&s;|&s;ible, to the ancient in&s;titutions of the country, which, however perverted by the occa&s;ional violence of an arbitrary Government, or corrupted by abu&s;es, will, I believe, be found judicious in them|&s;elves, and better accommodated to the
<PB N="44" REF="46">
genius of the people, than any &s;y&s;tem forcibly introduced from the other &s;ide of the globe. Whatever grievance they might have &s;uffered, by an abu&s;e of their own in&s;titutions, it could not be greater than tho&s;e, which belong to an admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice &s;uppo&s;ed to be guided by other principles, and pretending to be gratuitous. It is not in England at lea&s;t, that ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered without delay or vexation, or perhaps ever obtained without exorbitant expences. Inconve|niences of this nature, if felt in We&s;t|min&s;ter Hall, mu&s;t unavoidably be ag|gravated on the natives of this country, who, from their ignorance of our lan|guage, laws, and cu&s;toms, and of the forms of the Court, are left intirely at the mercy of their interpreters, advocates, and attornies.</P>

Suppo&s;ing the &s;everal articles al|ready touched upon to be now in &s;ome degree explained and under&s;tood, I may a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that there &s;till remains a number of abu&s;es to be cor|rected, which, though of le&s;s compara|tive importance, are &s;ufficient to di&s;tre&s;s and perplex any government, and to harra&s;s the people &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The mode of keeping public accounts here, be&s;ides that they are kept in a barbarous unknown language, &s;ome in Per&s;ian, and others in the Bengal dia|lect, is involved in ob&s;curity by a con|fu&s;ed reference to different aeras, and to different &s;y&s;tems of dividing the year. Few per&s;ons can fairly find their way through &s;uch a labyrinth; but every man, concerned either in paying or re|ceiving the revenues, may &s;ome way or other find his account in the confu&s;ion that ari&s;es from it.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51">
Secondly, The barbarous terms affect|edly made u&s;e of in all our records con|&s;titute a &s;eparate &s;cience, which, tho' not difficult to learn upon the &s;pot, tends to make our letters unintelligible in England. This practice might ea&s;ily be corrected. The be&s;t remedy, per|haps, for the confu&s;ion in the accounts and mode of reckoning, would be to in|troduce the Chri&s;tian aera at once into Bengal, &s;o that the ruling power and their &s;ubjects might compute by one and the &s;ame mea&s;ure of time.

<P N="40">40. The return of a permanent tri|bute to Great Britain, whether it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;pecie or manufactures, and whether exported on the Company's account or that of individuals, is an evil attached to the political &s;ituation of Bengal, under which, I fear, it will &s;ink at la&s;t. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the internal re&s;ources of any country &s;hould an&s;wer a con&s;tant demand on one &s;ide, without a propor|tionate &s;upply from other quarters. The fact is again&s;t Bengal, in both in&s;tances. Even oeconomy and good government, if &s;uch things exi&s;ted, would not alone be &s;ufficient to avert the con&s;equence. A country, that gives, mu&s;t receive, or its power of giving mu&s;t &s;oon be at an end. But our principal India markets are lo&s;t in the ruin of Per&s;ia and Indo&s;|tan, and Europe returns nothing. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into a detail of the di&s;advantages, under which the in|ternal traffic and indu&s;try of this coun|try

labour. The &s;ame principle of go|vernment, if it de&s;erves that name, which unites the Sovereign and the mer|chant in the &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;on of the Company, naturally extends thro' every branch of their commercial admi|ni&s;tration, and communicates &s;ome por|tion of their own arbitrary power to the lowe&s;t agent or factor in their &s;ervice. The abu&s;es that follow are minute in their operation, and &s;pare nothing. They reach to per&s;ons and property, which no other &s;y&s;tem of power could de&s;cend to, but which cannot e&s;cape the penetrating eyes of men acquainted with all the little channels, thro' which the lowe&s;t order of manufacturers de|rive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. To this unpro|tected cla&s;s of men no money has been &s;hewn: nor could it be otherwi&s;e in a country where the Sovereign has views and intere&s;ts incompatible with that cha|racter, and profe&s;&s;es them;&mdash;where the &s;ame power, or they who admini&s;ter it, take the rents of the lands as proprietor,&mdash;engro&s;s all the merchantable produce

The &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, united with the increa&s;e of taxes, could produce no other con|&s;equences but tho&s;e, which the Com|pany them&s;elves have felt and com|plained of,&mdash;the ruin of the manufac|turers, a con&s;iderable deba&s;ement in the quality of the goods, and an equal ad|vance upon the price.

<P N="42">42. I apprehend that the decline of Bengal takes its origin too high to be recovered by any vigour of Admini&s;tra|tion, or even by a correction of abu&s;es. A new principle mu&s;t be a&s;&s;umed for the government of the country, or it mu&s;t fall. Mea&s;ures, of any other quality, may perhaps delay the cri&s;is, but cannot prevent it.

<P>Your Lord&s;hip has &s;een an e&s;timate &s;ent home by me in January 1776, in which ninety-three lacks of current ru|pees are allotted to the inve&s;tment and all commercial charges, and twenty lacks to the other &s;ettlements. That e&s;timate, compared with accounts &s;ent home in former times, is moderate in &s;tating the re&s;ources of the country. The di&s;tribu|tion of them mu&s;t be confirmed or cor|rected
<PB N="58" REF="60">
by a higher authority than mine. Your Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve, however, that the Court of Directors, in their let|ter of the 24th of December, 1776<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Par. 70.</NOTE>, though very well &s;atisfied with the above appropriation of 113 lacks to their &s;er|vice, &s;eem inclined to re&s;erve &s;ome of the articles on the credit &s;ide of the e&s;ti|mate, under pretence that &s;uch deduc|tions fall upon the unappropriated &s;ur|plus, but &s;till leave part of it after all e&s;tabli&s;hments and &s;ervices are provided for. Among the articles &s;o intended to be re&s;erved by the Company, are the produce of the Europe cargoes here, and the amount of the bills which they have allowed their &s;ervants to draw upon them, and which the e&s;timate &s;uppo&s;es will be continued, equal in all to twenty-five lacks of current rupees. But I &s;ub|mit it to your Lord&s;hip, that they have not treated the e&s;timate fairly. A con|&s;iderable re&s;erve again&s;t unfore&s;een emer|gencies is as nece&s;&s;ary to be provided for
<PB N="59" REF="61">
as any article of e&s;tabli&s;hed expence, and more &s;o in this country than any other. On the lea&s;t alarm of an inva&s;ion, it is morally certain that every rupee in the hands of the natives would in&s;tantly di&s;|appear. Without an unappropriated &s;ur|plus of thirty lacks, no prudent man would undertake to an&s;wer for the &s;afety of the Government; much le&s;s to in&s;ure an inve&s;tment of ninety-three lacks again&s;t all accidents. If therefore the Company do not think fit to throw the amount of the articles above mentioned into the general fund, it will be indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary that an equal &s;um &s;hould be dedicated from the allotment made to them out of the revenues. The annual &s;upply of twenty lacks to Madras and Bombay is a ruinous drain to Bengal, and ought to be the fir&s;t article of re|trenchment; the remainder mu&s;t fall upon the inve&s;tment.</P>
<P N="43">43. If the Company &s;hould re&s;olve not to allow their &s;ervants to draw upon them to the u&s;ual amount of one hun|dred
<PB N="60" REF="62">
and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds, &s;ome con&s;ideration mu&s;t be had of the con&s;equences, and of the difficulties, to which individuals may be driven. Tho&s;e difficulties will, in the end, be &s;ur|mounted; and po&s;&s;ibly by means equally prejudicial to Bengal, to them&s;elves, and to the Company; that is, by loans to the foreign factories, or by the direct extraction of &s;pecie. A remittance in Bengal manufactures is &s;o di&s;advanta|geous, (owing to the advanced price here, and the &s;tate of the Europe markets) that no private per&s;ons could afford to remit their fortunes by that channel if they were openly at liberty to do &s;o. The Company at pre&s;ent are not &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain between the co&s;t and &s;ale of their inve&s;tment, becau&s;e the whole is given them by Bengal. Your Lord&s;hip will judge from the decline and poverty of the country on one &s;ide, and the wealth of individuals on the other, how far it may be probable that the enormous &s;um charged upon the re|venues on account of the inve&s;tment has
<PB N="61" REF="63">
been fairly laid out. The Commercial Board have now above a million &s;terling annually at their di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P N="44">44. The &s;econd que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"In what manner the inve&s;tment &s;hall be pro|vided,"</Q> will depend on the influence re&s;erved to the Company over the inter|nal government of the country. In what|ever degree &s;uch influence is continued, it will a&s;&s;uredly be employed, as it has been hitherto, in promoting the views of individuals, under the formidable name of the Company's commercial rights and intere&s;ts, and forcing the mea&s;ures of Government to bend to that &s;ingle con&s;ideration. If the Company are no longer to govern directly, it will be no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary that their right to engro&s;s the indu&s;try of the manufactu|rers, or to provide an inve&s;tment by force, &s;hould not &s;urvive their political power. Their pre&s;ent &s;ervants, I fear, have been too long in the lucrative ha|bits of monopoly and command to &s;ub|mit to any terms of equality between
<PB N="62" REF="64">
the manufacturers and them&s;elves. They follow the path of their predece&s;&s;ors, and inherit their ideas. But, my Lord, this is not a time to con&s;ult the pa&s;&s;ions, or prejudices, or intere&s;ts of individuals; the plain and &s;imple remedy, and indeed the only one, for abu&s;es of power, in a ca&s;e where power, however exerci&s;ed, is it&s;elf a violation of right, is to oblige the Company to revert to their original principles, to renounce the unnatural character in which they have lately act|ed, and, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to become mer|chants again.</P>
<P N="45">45. Before the Company obtained a political influence in the country, their inve&s;tment was provided at Calcutta and Dacca by contract with native merchants called <HI>Dadneys.</HI> Pre&s;ent circum&s;tances may require that &s;uch contracts &s;hould be open to merchants of all denomina|tions. The Company will benefit by the competition of &s;ellers at Calcutta, as the manufacturers would do by the com|petition of purcha&s;ers at the Aurungs.
<PB N="63" REF="65">
In a few years even contracts would be unnece&s;&s;ary. No tolerable rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for not reverting to a practice apparently &s;afe and oeconomical to the Company, and equally beneficial to the country. It may not an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e of their &s;ervants. It does not ad|mit of expen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments in the di&s;tricts, where chiefs, &s;uperintendants, and banians, detached from the Pre&s;i|dency, and armed with de&s;potic power to &s;upport the pretended commercial in|tere&s;ts of the Company, have taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the markets, excluded all com|petition, en&s;laved the manufacturers, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, obliged private merchants to purcha&s;e from them&s;elves, at an immoderate advance of price, the &s;ame goods which they had &s;eized and &s;et the Company's &s;eal upon in the loom, under pretence that they were wanted for the public inve&s;tment.</P>
<P N="46">46. I do not mean to intimate that practices of this nature have been carried on with equal violence in all the di&s;|tricts;
<PB N="64" REF="66">
but I am well a&s;&s;ured that, more or le&s;s, they have generally prevailed, and have not been confined to the Com|pany's &s;ervants. Adventurers of the lowe&s;t order have frequently found their way into the di&s;tricts, a&s;&s;uming a law|le&s;s dominion over the people, who have lo&s;t the protection of their native Prince, and, in fact, have no other to appeal to. If it be &s;eriou&s;ly meant to re&s;tore the trade of the country, the manufacturers mu&s;t be relieved from this oppre&s;&s;ion, and left at liberty to work for whom|&s;oever they think proper. Regulations, pretending to check the mi&s;conduct of individuals, will have no effect. In my judgment, there is but one cour&s;e to be pur&s;ued. The inve&s;tment mu&s;t be pro|vided by contract, as it was heretofore, until the general increa&s;e and improve|ment of the manufactures will admit of its being provided by ready-money pur|cha&s;es. The employment of Europeans in the di&s;tricts, whether with or without authority, or even Goma&s;tas with autho|rity, mu&s;t be &s;topped at all events; and
<PB N="65" REF="67">
this, in my opinion, is a mea&s;ure of in|di&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, that will admit of no qualification. I do not affirm that no difficulties or inconveniences will attend it at the out&s;et; but, if it be &s;eriou&s;ly meant to prefer the Company's true and permanent intere&s;ts to tho&s;e of indivi|duals, the Court of Directors will li&s;ten with re&s;erve and &s;u&s;picion to any repre|&s;entations they may receive from their &s;ervants on this &s;ubject. If the mea&s;ure &s;hould be adopted, the burthen and odi|um of it mu&s;t not be impo&s;ed on the Admini&s;tration here, much le&s;s mu&s;t we be loaded with an exclu&s;ive re&s;pon&s;ibility for the event. A &s;imple approbation or permi&s;&s;ion will not arm us with power &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t and defeat the general combination that would be formed again&s;t us. The orders from home mu&s;t be po|&s;itive, and binding on all parties. It is a gro&s;s and daring fallacy to a&s;&s;ert, that the manufacturers would not have &s;old their goods as readily to the Company as to any other merchant, provided they had been paid for them. If the Com|pany's
<PB N="66" REF="68">
&s;ervants had been compelled to do equal ju&s;tice to the natives and to their employers, it is not po&s;&s;ible that power or privilege &s;hould have been wanted to in&s;ure to the Company every commercial advantage they ought to aim at. The &s;uperior weight of their pur&s;e would naturally have &s;ecured to them, or to the per&s;ons who contracted with them, a preference in every market, and defeated any competition for the articles which compo&s;e their inve&s;tment. The free vent and exportation of the remain|ing produce of the country cannot be too liberally encouraged. I &s;ubmit my opinion to higher judgement, that the cu&s;tom hou&s;es &s;hould be new modelled, if not aboli&s;hed. They check the ope|rations of foreign trade in a country which properly <HI>&s;ells</HI> to all the world, and <HI>buys</HI> nothing, except &s;ome raw ma|terials of manufacture, and nece&s;&s;aries from England for the con&s;umption of Europeans. The inland cu&s;toms fetter the indu&s;try of the natives in all its mi|nute&s;t branches. The revenue, collected
<PB N="67" REF="69">
by the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, is either not worth the attention of Government, e&s;|pecially at the expence of oppre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubject and of many embarra&s;&s;ments to the export trade; or, &s;uppo&s;ing it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, the amount might be levied, with le&s;s inconvenience, directly from the land.</P>
<P N="47">47. When the&s;e capital di&s;courage|ments are removed, the productions of indu&s;try will increa&s;e, their quality will improve. The country, then, having &s;omething to <HI>&s;ell</HI> to other nations, will have &s;omething to <HI>give</HI> to England; and tho' a time <HI>mu&s;t</HI> come, when the nominal revenue can no longer be realized, when the inve&s;tment mu&s;t be retrenched, and every e&s;tabli&s;hment contracted; in other words, when a great and wealthy &s;tate, which ought to flouri&s;h by its expences, can only exi&s;t by its oeconomy, &s;till it is not a point of little moment to protract that event, if po&s;&s;ible, to a di&s;tant, un|certain period. The actual choice lies between a di&s;ea&s;e, which threatens im|mediate
<PB N="68" REF="70">
di&s;&s;olution, and a remedy, which at lea&s;t gives time for deliberation. We know not what favourable turns may appear during an interval of repo&s;e; but, at any rate, we &s;hould not ha&s;ten a cri&s;is, at which neither prudence nor fortune can &s;ave the object.</P>
<P N="48">48. The annual &s;upplies of the other Pre&s;idencies, in time of peace, amount to about twenty lacks of current rupees. I have &s;ubmitted my opinion to the Com|pany, that Bengal, in its pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, is not able to bear the continu|ance of &s;o great a drain of its re&s;ources. The future amount of this &s;upply will, I pre&s;ume, be con&s;idered in the allow|ance re&s;erved for the inve&s;tment out of the territorial revenues, and determined by it. The revenue acquired on the Malabar coa&s;t, by the late treaty with the Marattas, if faithfully applied to the &s;upport of the Company's e&s;tabli&s;hments at Bombay, ought, in a great mea&s;ure, to relieve Bengal from any further de|mand for that &s;ervice.

May, 1774, we have remitted to Bom|bay alone the &s;um of current rupees 81, 20, 777. I will not pronounce deci|&s;ively on the u&s;es of maintaining that &s;ettlement at &s;o exorbitant an expence; but the que&s;tion de&s;erves an attentive con&s;ideration. Notwith&s;tanding this great &s;upply from hence, they have incurred a debt of thirty lacks, (chiefly in the above period) which carries an intere&s;t of nine per cent.</P>
<P N="49">49. Fort St. George, in time of peace, ought to &s;upport it&s;elf. China will be &s;ufficiently &s;upplied by individuals here, without an extraction of &s;ilver from Eng|land, if the Company think proper to open their trea&s;ury at Canton, and grant bills at a rea&s;onable rate. If not, the mo|ney they refu&s;e will be lent to the French, Danes, and Swedes, who&s;e imports from China &s;tand in immediate competition with the Company, even for the con|&s;umption of the Briti&s;h dominions. The &s;upplies &s;ent from hence to Fort Marl|borough,
<PB N="70" REF="72">
and St. Helena, are not worth notice.</P>
<P N="50">50. The fourth and la&s;t que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline">"Whether the Company &s;hall monopo|lize any of the productions or manu|factures of the country?"</Q> would, perhaps, be more properly &s;tated, and better under&s;tood, if it were expre&s;&s;ed in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">"Is Bengal inca|pable of a greater produce, than the Company's inve&s;tment requires; or &s;hall it be prohibited from producing more than will &s;upply that demand?"</Q> This &s;tate of the que&s;tion is, in effect, the true one, and includes the an&s;wer. No man will affirm, that the Company's inve&s;tment is equal to the actual produce of the country, much le&s;s to what it is capable of producing; and if it were, Bengal, having no &s;urplus to <HI>&s;ell,</HI> would, in a very &s;hort period, have nothing to <HI>give.</HI> It is not even true, that the por|tion of the revenues, appropriated to the purcha&s;e of the inve&s;tment, returns un|dimini&s;hed into the provincial circulation,
<PB N="71" REF="73">
from which it was taken. In the ex|penditure of an immen&s;e capital, agency will pay it&s;elf, and every man will make &s;omething. Whatever this annual defal|cation may amount to, whether a fifth or a &s;ixth of the net &s;um allotted to the inve&s;tment, it is the wor&s;t of all taxes, becau&s;e it is taken directly from the &s;ources of production. But if this evil be no more avoidable than the obvious con&s;equences of it, the wi&s;dom of Go|vernment is &s;o much the more power|fully called upon, to qualify abu&s;es by improvements, and to balance a weight, which no policy can remove.</P>
<P N="51">51. I have &s;uppo&s;ed the merchant to be no longer Sovereign, nor charged with the general protection of the people:&mdash;Shall he retain the power of oppre&s;&s;ing them in detail? My Lord, I am &s;irm in my opinion, that the very monopolies, which the Company have appropriated to the &s;upply of their inve&s;tment, or to the increa&s;e of their revenues, and which they were ready enough to condemn in
<PB N="72" REF="74">
the hands of individuals, would ere long defeat the purpo&s;es they were intended to promote. They are now in exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or think they are, of the raw &s;ilk, &s;altpetre, opium, and &s;alt, manu|factured in Bengal. At the &s;ame time, the produce of the loom is apparently at their command. If the practice had been &s;trictly and entirely conformable to the principle, the re&s;ources of Bengal, in|&s;tead of declining by any gradations, mu&s;t have &s;unk precipitately. A partial re|medy, or palliation of &s;ome of the evils, attending the Government in&s;tituted or exerci&s;ed by the Company's &s;ervants, has been derived from its exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity and inju&s;tice. When po&s;itive laws are oppo&s;ed to every dictate of natural ju&s;tice, humanity, and right rea&s;on, it is not ea&s;y to carry them, by any degree of power, into complete execution. Even private frauds, which, con&s;idering their quality and extent, denote a want of vi|gour and fidelity in the admini&s;tration, have in &s;ome degree defended the coun|try again&s;t public in&s;titutions. This, I
<PB N="73" REF="75">
conceive, is the la&s;t &s;tate of mi&s;rule into which a nation can fall, while any forms what&s;oever are pre&s;erved,&mdash;Fundamen|tal errors of in&s;titution counteracted, but not removed by abu&s;es of Admini&s;tration, by deviations from principle, and by unit|ing all ranks of men in a regular con|nected &s;y&s;tem of fraud again&s;t Govern|ment.</P>
<P N="52">52. I have already taken notice of the orders received in December 1775, <Q REND="inline">"for prohibiting all per&s;ons under the Com|pany's protection from trading in any of the articles, which compo&s;e their inve&s;tment, until it was completed,"</Q> which never could happen, as the inve&s;t|ment proceeds the whole year round, with little relaxation. The&s;e orders have &s;ince been qualified, in con&s;equence of &s;trong repre&s;entations from hence; but under &s;uch limitations, and with condi|tions &s;o hazardous to the per&s;ons, whom the Court of Directors &s;uppo&s;ed to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government, that, even if the change they expected had taken
<PB N="74" REF="76">
place, their la&s;t in&s;tructions could have produced no effect. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General letter, 24th Dec. 1776, par. 70.</NOTE>They empower the Governor General and Council <Q REND="inline">"to &s;u&s;pend the execution of &s;uch part of their orders, as impo&s;e re&s;trictions on the commerce of individuals, provided we are <HI>ab&s;olutely certain</HI> it may be done, con&s;i&s;tent with the due provi&s;ion of an ample and well-cho&s;en inve&s;tment for the Company, and without ri&s;king the timely provi&s;ion of their inve&s;t|ment, the amount whereof <HI>mu&s;t on no account be hazarded, even for a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P N="53">53. Under conditions of this nature, their mo&s;t favoured Admini&s;tration could not have acted with &s;afety. But when they add, that, <Q REND="inline">"to indulge their com|mercial &s;ervants in every branch of trade, not prohibited by law, is a mea&s;ure, which nothing but the greate&s;t fidelity in their &s;ervants can render con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of the
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Company,"</Q> I apprehend they at once mi&s;take the fact, and preclude the re|medy. Their &s;ervants derive too many advantages from the Company's mono|poly, to wi&s;h for an avowed and general freedom of trade, in which others might participate; and what a&s;&s;urance have the Company, that the tru&s;t, repo&s;ed in their &s;ervants, is not as much abu&s;ed under apparent re&s;trictions, and as effectually for their own intere&s;ts, as it could be, if all re&s;trictions were aboli&s;hed? The fir&s;t prohibitory orders, dated the 3d of March, 1775, &s;till remain in force, without any attempt whatever to correct them by the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="54">54. The que&s;tion of the &s;alt trade has been &s;ufficiently canva&s;&s;ed in England, and ought to be thoroughly under&s;tood. The Company, it &s;eems, have received new lights on this &s;ubject. Your Lord|&s;hip knows how long, and with what ve|hemence, the monopoly of &s;alt had been reprobated by them. In May 1766, they thought it <Q REND="inline">"neither con&s;i&s;tent with their
<PB N="76" REF="78">
honour nor their dignity, to promote &s;uch an exclu&s;ive trade; they could not &s;uffer them&s;elves to indulge a thought towards the continuance of it <HI>on any conditions what&s;oever;</HI> and that no regulations could be effectual to pre|vent the like con&s;equences, which they had &s;een.&mdash;They con&s;idered it too as di&s;graceful, and below the dignity of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to allow of &s;uch a monopoly, and that, were they to allow of it, under any re&s;trictions, they &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves as a&s;&s;enting and &s;ub&s;cribing to all the mi&s;chiefs, which Bengal had pre&s;ented to them for the four years pa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P N="55">55. In their letter of the 24th of De|cember la&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paragraph 76.</NOTE>, they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that the mo|nopoly, on its pre&s;ent footing, can be no grievance to the country, and they direct that, for the pre&s;ent, the plan adopted by their late Pre&s;ident and Council be continued."</Q> This plan is
<PB N="77" REF="79">
a rigorous monopoly, for the &s;uppo&s;ed exclu&s;ive profit of the Company. In the fir&s;t two years of the contract, it rai&s;ed the price above fifty per cent to the con|&s;umer, and produced an immoderate im|portation of foreign &s;alt, by which the Company has been con&s;tantly under&s;old, in one of the &s;taple commodities of Ben|gal, at their own markets. In con&s;e|quence of this importation, frauds in the management, &s;muggling, &amp;c., the Com|pany have gained nothing by their con|tracts in the third and fourth years, and now they have an enormous quantity upon their hands, which can only be &s;old at a long credit, and never without a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The&s;e notorious facts have determined Mr. Ha&s;tings him|&s;elf to renounce the monopoly, even again&s;t the Company's in&s;tructions.</P>
<P N="56">56. With re&s;pect to &s;alpetre, the Company's monopoly, or rather that ex|erci&s;ed by their &s;ervants, has produced the effect, which it always mu&s;t do, of dimini&s;hing the produce, until they at
<PB N="78" REF="80">
la&s;t find it difficult to procure even the trifling quantity wanted for their inve&s;t|ment. The &s;carcity perhaps is exagge|rated for private purpo&s;es. But &s;altpetre ought naturally to be one of the mo&s;t cheap and plentiful productions of the &s;oil, and would be &s;o, if the natives were allowed the free u&s;e of their own lands, and the free di&s;po&s;al of their own in|du&s;try.</P>
<P N="57">57. The opium of Bahar has been for many years monopolized, formerly by the favourites of the country Govern|ment, with &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice and lenity to the riots; and, in later times, by the Company's &s;ervants, out of who&s;e hands it was taken by Mr. Ha&s;tings in the year 1773, and engro&s;&s;ed for the benefit of the Company. It was not likely that any abu&s;es in the former practice, or any of the u&s;ual effects of a monopoly, &s;hould be corrected by this alteration. The &s;er|vants of Government might po&s;&s;ibly have been re&s;trained by checks, which cannot be impo&s;ed on Government it&s;elf.
<PB N="79" REF="81">
A doubt whether, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, the trade could be really and ef|fectually laid open, and whether it would not revert, in fact, to the gentlemen in &s;tation at Patna, produced an early diffe|rence of opinion between Sir John Cla|vering and my&s;elf, on the expediency of continuing the opium contract, but by no means touched the general principles, on which we invariably concurred in con|demning monopolies. We agreed, that whenever there was a Government &s;uffi|ciently firm and independent to execute its own re&s;olutions, and to enforce obe|dience to them, the monopoly of opium &s;hould be aboli&s;hed. The deplorable &s;tate of Bahar makes it nece&s;&s;ary, that this &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t mea&s;ures of &s;uch a Government. The Company have lately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General letter, 24th Dec. 1776, par. 77.</NOTE> authorized us to give up this commodity as an article of commerce; but the contract was already di&s;po&s;ed of for the three en&s;uing years, before the receipt of their orders.</P>
<P N="58"><PB N="80" REF="82">
58. Raw &s;ilk is not &s;ubject to a de|clared monopoly at pre&s;ent. The quan|tity of this article is greatly increa&s;ed. The &s;tate of the India markets throws it chiefly into the Company's hands, with|out competition. The demand &s;eems to increa&s;e in Europe.</P>
<P N="59">59. One general objection occurs, in this country, to monopolies exerci&s;ed by Government, which does not perhaps exi&s;t in any other. The commodity to be engro&s;&s;ed is always provided by ad|vances of money out of the public trea|&s;ury. A proportion of the&s;e advances mu&s;t be paid at an early period, before the &s;eed is &s;own, as in the ca&s;e of opium, or before the work is under|taken, and mu&s;t be continued as the bu&s;ine&s;s proceeds. The ri&s;que of the capital advanced, which is not incon&s;ide|rable, and the value of the intere&s;t, ought to be calculated, and deducted from the ultimate profits of the mono|poly. A number of accidents may oc|ca&s;ion partial lo&s;&s;es on the money ad|vanced.
<PB N="81" REF="83">
An inva&s;ion or any general calamity would be the lo&s;s of the whole. The Company have experienced the truth of this opinion in another part of their practice. Their out&s;tanding de|&s;perate balances, ari&s;ing on advances made to the weavers, amount to a very con&s;i|derable &s;um. On the other hand, it makes a wide difference to the country whether advances, to be repaid out of future production, are made by Govern|ment, or by individuals. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, a multitude of per&s;ons are pre|cluded from engaging in the bu&s;ine&s;s engro&s;&s;ed by Government, and from em|ploying to advantage whatever means and credit they have left. The circulation of &s;o much private property is lo&s;t, and the proprietor compelled to live with par&s;imony on his capital. At the &s;ame time, the &s;ums, i&s;&s;uing from the trea|&s;ury to the contractor, flow in one large &s;tream, under the direction of a de&s;potic monopoli&s;t, who&s;e ea&s;e and convenience lead him to contract with as few people, and to confine his advances to as few
<PB N="82" REF="84">
places, as po&s;&s;ible. This is the funda|mental principle of monopoly. On the contrary, a free trade invites numbers to engage in it, who, in the face of a general competition, could never &s;ucceed but by fair dealing and &s;uperior in|du&s;try; and who&s;e fortune, circulating in a variety of little channels, might extend to the remote&s;t corners of the country, and act directly on the indu&s;|try of the lowe&s;t orders of men.</P>
<P N="60">60. It is not for me to attempt to lead your Lord&s;hip's opinion, on the general que&s;tion of monopolies, by any other information than that of the facts before me. In this country, the exerci&s;e of them, under the direct authority and for the &s;uppo&s;ed benefit of a de&s;potic go|vernment, has manife&s;tly united an in|tere&s;t and a power, which ought never to have met in the &s;ame hands. Such a union, in the ca&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, whe|ther real or pretended, con&s;titutes the plaintiffs parties again&s;t Government, and leaves no indifferent tribunal to ad|mini&s;ter
<PB N="83" REF="85">
ju&s;tice to them. I &s;ubmit to judgement, whether it ought to be abo|li&s;hed or continued.</P>
<P N="61">61. I will not, my Lord, add a u&s;e|le&s;s apology to the trouble I have already given you. If the contents of this let|ter &s;hould not ju&s;tify the length of it, I have nothing to plead, but the &s;ame error of judgement which has uniformly governed my conduct, and from which no man has hitherto &s;uffered any thing but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have no per&s;onal intere&s;t, immediate or remote, in the &s;ucce&s;s of this repre|&s;entation. Before it can produce any effect in Bengal, the period of my ap|pointment will probably be expired.</P>

<HEAD>FINALLY,</HEAD>
<P>To compare the whole of the pre&s;ent expences of the Government of Fort William with the whole of their pre&s;ent re&s;ources; and each of the&s;e re&s;pectively with that of former periods.</P>
<P>When the Secret Committee &s;hall have carried their inve&s;tigation thus far, one general que&s;tion, perhaps the mo&s;t im|portant of all, will remain to be con&s;i|dered, and may properly conclude their inquiries.</P>
<P>Whereas the Legi&s;lature have ve&s;ted the whole civil and military power of the Pre&s;idency of Fort William, and in effect the Government of Bengal, in the Governor General and Council, who are directed and required to pay due obedi|ence to all &s;uch orders as they &s;hall re|ceive from the Court of Directors, with whom alone they are directed to corre&s;|pond; it follows that the authority of the Court of Directors is the only me|dium,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
by which that of Great Britain over Bengal is held; and if their autho|rity be &s;lighted or defied, it follows that the dependance of that di&s;tant dominion on this country is &s;o far forth weakened, and its connection with it loo&s;ened, if not di&s;&s;olved. It &s;eems then to be a point that de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention of Parliament to inquire and a&s;|certain, in what degree the authority of the Court of Directors has been in fact binding on the Governor General and Council; in what in&s;tances it has been re&s;i&s;ted, and in general what mea&s;ures have been adopted and pur&s;ued by the Court of Directors to maintain it, and to inforce obedience to their orders. And it is to be pre&s;umed that Parliament will expect an opinion from the Secret Com|mittee of the effects that have already taken place, the con&s;equences that may en&s;ue, and whether the dominion of Great Britain over Bengal is &s;ecure, if the powers ve&s;ted in the Court of Di|rectors by Parliament be found to have had no operation; whether owing to <HI>their</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="104">
neglect or inattention to their duty, or to any other cau&s;es prevailing on this &s;ide; or to a &s;pirit of independance, contumacy, and di&s;obedience in their repre&s;entatives abroad, which the Court of Directors have &s;trongly condemned, but have not &s;ufficient power to correct.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
In &s;upport of the propriety of continu|ing the territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions under the Government of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany, it was &s;trenuou&s;ly urged in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the natives had eminently pro&s;pered under that Government; that it would wound their feelings to be made &s;ubject to any other, and perhaps might occa&s;ion a convul&s;ion among them, which might prove fatal to the Briti&s;h intere&s;ts in India.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Earl Cornwallis to the Court of Directors of the Ea&s;t-India Company, dated the 2d of Augu&s;t, 1789.</HEAD>
<P>INDEPENDENT of all other con&s;ide|rations, I can a&s;&s;ure you that it will be of the utmo&s;t importance, for pro|moting the &s;olid intere&s;ts of the Com|pany,
<PB N="105" REF="106">
that the principal landholders and traders in the interior parts of the country &s;hould be <HI>re&s;tored</HI> to &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as to enable them to &s;up|port their families with decency, and to give a liberal education to their children, according to the cu&s;toms of their re&s;pective ca&s;ts and religions, that a regular gradation of ranks may be &s;upported, which is no where more nece&s;&s;ary than in this country for pre|&s;erving order in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to be obliged to &s;ay that agriculture and internal commerce has for many years been gradually declin|ing; and that at pre&s;ent, excepting the cla&s;s of Shroffs and Banians, who re&s;ide almo&s;t entirely in great towns, the inhabitants of the&s;e provinces <HI>were advancing ha&s;tily to a general &s;tate of po|verty and wretchedne&s;s.</HI> In this de&s;crip|tion I mu&s;t even include almo&s;t every Zemindar in the Company's territo|ries; which, though it may have been partly occa&s;ioned by their own indo|lence
<PB N="106" REF="107" MS="y">
and extravagance, I am afraid mu&s;t al&s;o be, in a great mea&s;ure, at|tributed to the defects of our former &s;y&s;tem of management.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">
The nature of the Zemindary tenure cannot be more accurately de&s;cribed than it has been by Mr. Ha&s;tings, in his Defence before the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, page 32, viz.</P>
<P><Q>HAD Bulwant&s;ing been are al and hereditary Zemindar, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would have gone to him <HI>of cour&s;e,</HI> there being in India no &s;uch cu&s;tom as di&s;in|heritance.
