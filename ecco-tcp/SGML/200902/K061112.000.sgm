<HEAD>TO THE REV. &mdash; BALL, OF WINFRITH, NEAR WEYMOUTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I rambled into Dor&s;et&s;hire in the &s;ummer of 1791, my only introduction to your acquaintance was your own frank affability, and my &s;ole recommendation to your ho&s;pitable roof, that I was a &s;tranger. By your good-natured politene&s;s, my mind was cheered in the &s;olitudes of Lulworth, and by your many friendly and kind offices I was furni&s;hed with informa|tion in a place where all was novelty,
<PB REF="4">though my fir&s;t charm there was the certainty of what I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be common in England, a pious and be|nevolent clergyman; and though I could, previous to my vi&s;its at Win|frith, boa&s;t the honour of having &s;tood before the great gates of a bi&s;hop's palace; yet, for the comforts I there enjoyed in the little parlour of a country par&s;onage-hou&s;e, accept this trifling te&s;timony of well-remembered goodne&s;s to,</P>

<L>He had his learning in a laughing&mdash;&s;chool.</L>
<L>Order, and ancient laws, he dares neglect;</L>

<L>Nay, &s;pite of all grave cla&s;&s;ical communities,</L>
<L>Wou'd &s;ooner make you laugh than keep the unities.</L>
<L>Mirth is his aim&mdash;and critics! we implore you,</L>
<L>Relax, while our light &s;cenes we lay before you!</L>
<L>Good-humour to the countenance adds graces,</L>
<L>Unbend the iron mu&s;cles of your faces!</L>

<L><HI>We</HI> catch the godde&s;s while &s;he's cutting capers.</L>
<L>To prove that we have caught her in the act,</L>
<L>Our Hermitage is built upon <HI>a fact.</HI></L>
<L>If, then, the drama's frolic pencil draws</L>
<L>A frolic fact&mdash;away with critic laws!</L>
<L>And grant the &s;ketcher's fancy your applau&s;e!</L>
<L>Oft has he drawn before&mdash;this &s;hop is full</L>
<L>With touches from his hand; and none thought dull;</L>
<L>Should this, to-night, &s;eem vapid to your eyes,</L>
