<P>Colonel Epaulette, let me entreat you to leave off attempting the blunt hone&s;ty of the Engli&s;h. It only transforms your countrymen into brutes. The attempt is as ridiculous as for the rough Engli&s;h to ape the cu&s;toms and manners of the French, where we ever mi&s;s the mark, and poli&s;h into puppies.</P>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Sir Shenkin, if you don't imme|diately pay me the five thou&s;and you laid me, and give your con&s;ent to my marrying your &s;i&s;ter, I'll refer your conduct to the jockey club; and 'tis &s;o notorious, that you'll not only be excluded the turf here, but at every race in England.</P>

<P>Why, my little Welchman, I am afraid you'll be po&s;ted at Tatter&s;all's.</P>

<P>I'm nick'd, &s;ous'd and &s;lamm'd. Here, take my &s;i&s;ter Celia. I'll back him again&s;t the field; for he has tricked me that have nicked hundreds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Shenkin, this is the fir&s;t good I ever knew derived from gaming. For what &s;en&s;ation mu&s;t that man be capable of, that builds upon the mi&s;ery of others; and rai&s;es a fortune on the ruin and bank|ruptcy of his fellow-creatures!</P>

<P>It may be &s;o; but as I &s;et out a young pigeon, I'm re&s;olved to die an old rook.</P>

<P>Bravo! my boy. Give me your hand. And at dinner time you &s;hall never want a nail in my parlour to hang your hat on. You &s;hall po&s;t my ledger, and drive a gig.</P>

<P>With all my heart. But, &s;ir, I'll have no illiberal prejudices in my family. National reflections are unworthy the brea&s;t of an Engli&s;hman; and how|ever in war each may vindicate his country's honour. in peace let us not know a di&s;tance but the &s;treights of Dover.</P>
