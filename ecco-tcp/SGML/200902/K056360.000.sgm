<P>THE Earl of Warwick, A TRAGEDY, As it is perform'd at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement. To the PUBLIC,</HEAD>
<P>THE author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his obli|gation to the public, for their favourable reception of THE EARL OF WARWICK. He flatters him&s;elf, that the li|cen&s;e &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his plan, which he has taken in common with other writers, in deviating from hi&s;torical truth, e&s;pe|cially in a period &s;o di&s;tant and ob&s;cure, will meet with in|dulgence.</P>
<P>For the many faults <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of this piece, he can only plead that title to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> is generally extended in favour of a fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> that the &s;ame candour which approv'd on the &s;tage, will accompany it to the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>He cannot, without the mo&s;t manife&s;t inju&s;tice, forbear to add, that the more than ordinary exertion of dramatic powers, di&s;play'd by the principal actors concerned in it, contributed in a great mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of the performance.</P>

<L>SEVERE each poet's lot; but &s;ure mo&s;t hard</L>
<L>Is the condition of the playhou&s;e bard:</L>
<L>Doom'd to hear all that wou'd-be critics talk,</L>
<L>And in the go-cart of dull rules to walk!</L>
<L>"Yet authors multiply," you &s;ay. 'Tis true.</L>
<L>But what a numerous crop of critics too!</L>
<L>Scholars alone of old dur&s;t judge and write;</L>
<L>But now each journali&s;t turns Stagyrite.</L>
<L>Quintilians in each coffee-hou&s;e you meet,</L>
<L>And many a Longinus walks the &s;treet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Shake&s;pear's days, when his advent'rous mu&s;e,</L>
<L>A mu&s;e of fire! dur&s;t each bold licence u&s;e,</L>
<L>Her noble ardour met no critic's phlegm,</L>
<L>To check wild fancy, or her flights condemn:</L>
<L>Ariels and Calibans unblam'd &s;he drew,</L>
<L>Or goblins, gho&s;ts, and witches, brought to view.</L>
<L>If to hi&s;toric truth &s;he &s;hap'd her ver&s;e,</L>
<L>A nation's annals freely &s;he'd rehear&s;e;</L>
<L>Bring Rome's or England's &s;tory on the &s;tage,</L>
<L>And run, in three &s;hort hours, thro' half an age.</L>
<L>Our bard, all terror-&s;truck, and fill'd with dread,</L>
<L>In Shake&s;pear's awful foot&s;teps dares not tread;</L>
<L>Thro' the wide field of hi&s;t'ry fears to &s;tray,</L>
<L>And builds upon one narrow &s;pot his play;</L>
<L>Steps not from realm to realm, whole feas between,</L>
<L>But barely changes twice or thrice his &s;cene:</L>
<L>While Shake&s;pear vaults on the poetic wire,</L>
<L>And pleas'd &s;pectators fearfully admire,</L>
<L>Our bard, a critic pole between his hands,</L>
<L>On the tight-rope, &s;carce balanc'd, trembling &s;tands;</L>
<L>Slowly and cautiou&s;ly his way he makes,</L>
<L>And fears to fall at ev'ry &s;tep he takes:</L>
<L>While then fierce Warwick he before you brings,</L>
<L>That &s;etter-up and puller-down of kings,</L>
<L>With Briti&s;h candour di&s;&s;ipate his &s;ear!</L>
<L>An Engli&s;h &s;tory fits an Engli&s;h ear.</L>
<L>Tho' har&s;h and crude you deem his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay,</L>
<L>A &s;econd may your favours well repay;</L>
<L>Applau&s;e may nerve his ver&s;e, and chear his heart,</L>
<L>And teach the practice of this dangerous art.</L>
