<HEAD>THREE SHORT LETTERS TO THE <HI>People of England,</HI> PROVING THE PUBLIC GRIEVANCES COMPLAINED OF TO BE <HI>IDEAL.</HI></HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother Citizens, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent di&s;turbed &s;tate of the people, who&s;e minds may have been mi&s;led by mi&s;repre&s;entation and fal&s;e argument, permit me to interfere and explain matters in their true and pro|per light.</P>
<P>Our eyes have for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been turned towards the French na|tion. They certainly had long been ruled by a rod of iron, and there is no wonder that they groaned under it. Their monarchy was de&s;potic, the King and his Mini&s;ters could levy taxes without the con&s;ent of the peo|ple, they could impri&s;on at plea&s;ure;
<PB N="2" REF="2">even without trial, and the privi|leges of their nobility were &s;o great that they were almo&s;t as de&s;potic as their monarch. As all men are up|on an equality by birth-right, that is to &s;ay, as all men by nature have a claim to the &s;ame natural privileges, tho&s;e who enjoy the&s;e privileges, as I &s;hall &s;hew we do, could not but exult at the &s;pirit of the French, in throwing of the yoke they laboured under; and in new modelling their con&s;titution, they have in general adopted that of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>Ours is a mild monarchical go|vernment, we dread not the tyranny or evils of de&s;poti&s;m. We have a Magna Charta, that prevents fines being exce&s;&s;ive or more than we are able to pay, &s;o that no man need ever fear perpetual impri&s;onment; a habeas corpus act, which judges are obliged to attend to, to bring us be|fore a court, and make us acquainted with the rea&s;ons of our impri&s;onment; our Judges are appointed for life, that they may be independant of ad|mini&s;tration; and we are tried for our offences, by a jury of our own coun|trymen. The life and property of every individual is &s;ecured by law, nor is there an injury, man can &s;u&s;|tain either in his per&s;on, or his ef|fects, that he cannot meet with re|dre&s;s in: I will allow that redre&s;s in &s;ome ca&s;es is expen&s;ive, and happy for us that it is &s;o, or the litigious would always be at law. Our mo|ney is not taken from us but with our own con&s;ent, and we give our concurrence to every act of Parlia|ment that pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the ble&s;&s;ings of our own government, what motive can we have to change it? It is idle to think of <HI>any</HI> change except for the better, and what &s;ecurity have we, if this government was a republican to|morrow, that we &s;hould have fewer placemen or le&s;s venality in Parlia|ment? The bu&s;ine&s;s of admini&s;tra|tion mu&s;t go on, and if there is an evil, it is in the people them&s;elves who put the members to &s;uch an ex|pence for a &s;eat in parliament, and chu&s;e &s;uch mercenary repre&s;entatives that as Sir Robert Walpole u&s;ed to &s;ay, they will not vote even accord|ing to their con&s;ciences without a re|ward. We have had patriot mini&s;|ters, in the whig intere&s;t, who though on their coming into office &s;et their faces again&s;t corruption found nothing was to be done with out it, and of cour&s;e were in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obliged to follow the &s;tep of their predece&s;&s;ors. It is not my de&s;ign here to point out where the re|medy lies; it certainly does not lie in a change of our con&s;titution. For whether there is a King or not, me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in high office may have it in their power to u&s;e the public money im|properly. I will now enquire into the nature of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we complain of.</P>
<P>Is our Government in general op|pre&s;&s;ive?&mdash;No. Has not the experience of the la&s;t hundred years taught us, that our government has been mild, and that admini&s;tration has been con|tinually &s;truggling for the intere&s;t of the people at large? Does not every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament produce fre&s;h &s;a|lutary laws, not laws of oppre&s;&s;ion, but laws to &s;ecure the ea&s;e and pro|perty of the &s;ubject, to encourage in|ventions, prevent &s;carcity and pro|mote trade?</P>
<P>Has not all our commercial trea|ties had for their object, the good of this country?</P>
<P>Has not our wars, our interfer|ence with foreign &s;tates tended to the &s;ame end, namely to the peace of Europe and ultimately to our own peace?</P>
<P>If foreign wars and foreign connexi|ons have increa&s;ed the national debt; is it a debt that overloads us? Are
<PB N="3" REF="3">we not able to bear this debt?&mdash;Does not our &s;tocks ri&s;e under it? And are we not, notwith&s;tanding, in the high|e&s;t credit both at home and abroad?</P>
<P>Is the national debt then a griev|ance?&mdash;No&mdash;I will admit it is owing to this, that we are taxed &s;o high, in order to pay the intere&s;t of that debt, but it does not follow, that &s;uch taxes are a grievance. But for &s;uch taxes, every article of life would be cheaper. What then? If a la|bouring man who cannot live now for le&s;s than 20l. a year, could main|tain him&s;elf for ten pounds, in&s;tead of receiving eighteen-pence a day for his labour, his employer would pay him but half the money: he would not be a &s;hilling the richer. When the quartern loaf was &s;old for four-pence, a day labourer in the country had only ten-pence a day; now it is &s;old for 7d. he has &s;ixteen-pence; He therefore &s;uffers not by the dear|ne&s;s of provi&s;ions. Forty years ago, when the articles of life were forty per cent cheaper, the wages of a wo|man &s;ervant was three or four pounds, that of a man &s;ervant five or &s;ix pounds; now they are treble the &s;um. Every thing is advanced in equal pro|portion. Land, let at 5s. an acre at the time I &s;peak of, is now let at 15s. and a load of wheat that then &s;old for 5l. wil now fetch 10l. or 12l; and was, I &s;ay, the national debt paid off, and the nation required only a revenue of three millions in&s;tead of 15 millions, the con&s;equence to the public would be wor&s;e than at pre&s;ent. Every thing would fall in its price, and the only benefit, if it can be &s;o called, that the people would derive from it, would be a little more ea&s;e. The pre&s;ent dearne&s;s of things is a &s;pur to indu&s;try and invention, and this I tru&s;t will be allowed to conduce to the health, the happine&s;s and the wealth of indi|viduals. Look at Spain, the exi|gencies of that government are drawn from their mines in America: when money is wanted, they do not levy taxes on the people; and what is the con&s;equence? Articles of living are cheap, the people are idle, but they have little or no trade.</P>
<P>But &s;urely idlene&s;s, which is the pa|rent of evil and ill health can never be deemed a happine&s;s. I need only appeal here to the bu&s;y and indu&s;tri|ous, and a&s;k them whether they are ever more unhappy than when time hangs heavy on their hands, and they have nothing to do?</P>
<P>The national debt, large as it is then, is no grievance; le&s;&s;ening it indeed might be attended with &s;ome advan|tage to the lower cla&s;s of people, as it may enable the mini&s;ters to take off &s;ome of tho&s;e taxes that more imme|diately affect that cla&s;s. This our pre&s;ent mini&s;ter with great credit to him&s;elf has been &s;tudying to do, and has done for &s;ome years pa&s;t; but was the whole debt paid off, it would be an injury to this country in&s;tead of a benefit&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, it would, as I have ob&s;erved, by lowering the prices of the articles of living, tend to make the people idle, le&s;&s;en our wealth and con&s;equence, and make us le&s;s re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world. In the next place, if it requires ten millions of money to pay the intere&s;t of the debt, let us con&s;ider how many millions of people it tends to &s;upport, not only commi&s;&s;ioners, tax-gather|ers, clerks, &amp;c. but tho&s;e who have money in the funds. There is &s;carce a poor man but has &s;ome friend who has money there lodged. If the nation at large did not want to bor|row money; how would tho&s;e who have money to &s;pare employ it? They might lend it to others on mortgage, who would often cheat them. Land they would not be able to purcha&s;e, for land-holders would live &s;o much cheaper than they do now, that they would have no occa&s;ion to &s;ell; in
<PB N="4" REF="4">&s;hort, the con&s;equence would be, that the people, as I have &s;aid, would not be &s;o indu&s;trious; the le&s;s money they wanted, the le&s;s they would work, and of cour&s;e would not be &s;o rich as they are.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, the million of money annually allotted for the &s;upport of the Crown is no grievance; that money is &s;pent in the country, for money cannot legally be carried out of it. Whatever property is &s;ent out of the country, is &s;ent in manu|factures, for which the inhabitants have been paid, and of cour&s;e have enjoyed the fruits of.</P>
<P>So again, though I am no advocate for &s;quandering, &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome money is idly or profu&s;ely expended by the &s;tate. This may be the ca&s;e in the opinion of &s;ome, perhaps not &s;o in that of others; but admit it&mdash;What then? All this money &s;o &s;pent reverts to the people again, in a thou&s;and ways, it being &s;pent in the country; and thus encourages arts, &s;ciences, trade, manufactures and commerce. Be&s;ides, let this be ever &s;uch a grie|vance, it is not an object of that mag|nitude, as to make a change of con&s;ti|tution nece&s;&s;ary to remedy it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>Let me now a&s;k, What are the great oppre&s;&s;ions we complain of? Is it a &s;tanding army? We &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of this. Its great and fir&s;t u&s;e is to keep other nations in awe of us, who would otherwi&s;e overrun us, as did the Saxons and Danes formerly, and as the French have done Savoy and Brab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt; its &s;econd u&s;e is to keep the violent and ungovernable in order, to enforce the laws made by our|&s;elves for our own &s;afety and &s;ecurity, and &s;uffer the well di&s;po&s;ed to enjoy their ca&s;e and property unmole&s;ted. We have &s;een this u&s;e of the army in the plots in London in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and in the riots la&s;t year at Birming|ham, where the mi&s;chief done fell upon the towns at large.</P>
<P>Quartering of &s;oldiers on public-hou&s;es has been con&s;idered as oppre&s;|&s;ive; but as the profe&s;&s;ion of a publi|can is a continued bu&s;tle, a military inmate or two is &s;carce noticed among the crowd, and the expence the publi|can is put to, is paid by his cu&s;to|mers; for whil&s;t another trade&s;man is contented with 40 per cent. profit, the publican charges 80 per cent. and often more; &s;o that the quartered &s;ol|dier is fed by the gue&s;ts that frequent that hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In large, manufacturing towns, &s;uch as Birmingham, Coventry, &amp;c quartering of &s;oldiers on public-hou&s;es has been found for many political rea&s;ons improper. Admini&s;tration, who&s;e eyes are always open to the intere&s;ts of the people, &s;eeing this, have ordered barracks to be erected in &s;uch towns.</P>
<P>Are Tithes an oppre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No. A tenth part of the produce of labour and cultivation, has been appropriat|ed from the earlie&s;t ages of the world for the maintenance of the clergy, and where the farmer has not with|held this tenth, there has been no di&s;pute between the Farmer and the Par&s;on. Our Saviour enjoined his di&s;ciples to contribute to their &s;up|port; if then they are to be paid by the Farmer, why not pay it in kind as well as in money? It &s;aves the farmer the trouble of converting that kind into money. But the fact is, that it is not the farmer who pays the tithe, but his Landlord. When a farmer enters into treaty for a farm, he con&s;iders, or at lea&s;t he ought to con&s;ider, not only the nature of the &s;oil, what it will produce, what di&s;|tance he has to carry it to market, but what tithe, what taxes he has to pay, what &s;ervices his landlord re|quires of him, what re&s;trictions he binds him to, what mi&s;chief he &s;hall
<PB N="5" REF="5">&s;u&s;tain by hunters, and what injuries are done him by the game and game laws. All the&s;e things he adds to the expence of cultivation, and the rent required; and then by calculating the produce of the land, he judges whe|ther he &s;hall be able to pay that rent and maintain him&s;elf and family; if not, he either gives a reduced rent or declines the farm. So that in fact it is his landlord, that pays both tithes, taxes and every other outgoing; for land that is tithe-free lets for more than land equally good that is not &s;o.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning, every tax is paid ultimately by the monied men of this kingdom. Tho&s;e who have no &s;ettled income mu&s;t live. The&s;e live by their labour or their indu&s;try. If they are employed, as &s;ervants in mere manual labour, their wages are proportioned to the dearne&s;s or cheapne&s;s of the &s;everal articles of life, as I have before &s;hewn: in this ca&s;e, the taxes on &s;uch arti|cles are paid by their employers. If a man lives by manufacturing goods, he, like the farmer, con&s;iders every expence he pays in &s;uch manufactur|ing, and puts a price upon the articles accordingly, &s;o a to yield him &s;ufficient profit to maintain him&s;elf: here al&s;o again the taxes are paid by the con|&s;umer, the monied man; &s;o it is in hou&s;e-rent. A hou&s;e with 40l. a year with the taxes paid by the tenant, would fetch 60l. a year, if the taxes were paid by the landlord. It is the landlord then that pays the taxes; not the tenant.&mdash;Now if the monied men and men of landed property in this kingdom do not complain; why &s;hould the lower cla&s;s, who are in no ca&s;e the &s;ufferers?</P>
<P>The &s;ame arguments will hold good with re&s;pect to the game, which has idly been con&s;idered as an oppre&s;&s;ion. Who, &s;ay they, has as good a right to the game upon a farm, as the farmer who feeds it? I have &s;hewn that the farmer does not feed it, but at the ex|pence of his landlord; for if a country was as much overrun with foxes as it may be with partridges and hares, &s;o that a farmer could not keep gee&s;e or poultry; if he thought proper to take a farm in &s;uch a country, he would pay a rent in proportion, and thus throw the grievance on his land|lord. A landlord re&s;erves the game to him&s;elf, as he does the timber; and every farmer knows that the headlands of a field abounding with timber, produce &s;maller crops than the more open parts of the &s;ame field, and why? Becau&s;e &s;uch timber over|&s;hadows the land beneath and draws it, and their roots &s;preading out into the headlands draw their nouri&s;h|ment and are fed from &s;uch headlands. The farmer then feeds the timber on his farm, in the &s;ame manner as he does the game, and yet never pre|&s;umes to have any claim upon the timber, when re&s;erved to his land|lord; nor yet makes complaint of any injury he &s;u&s;tains, when &s;uch timber is felled. The &s;ame rea&s;oning is applicable to the game. The laws have re&s;erved it for the benefit and diver&s;ion of the landholder and his friends. The poorer cla&s;s of men are re&s;trained from &s;porting, as labourers are from playing &s;kittles and other games at public-hou&s;es, that nothing &s;hall draw them off from their em|ploys, to the detriment of their ma&s;|ters, their families and the &s;tate. The injury done by lords of manors, and their keepers on &s;own lands and in the de&s;truction of fences, in the end falls on the owner of the &s;oil, as he gets a le&s;s rent for it, in propor|tion to the mi&s;chief he does.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould the rich, &s;ay the en|vious poor, be allowed more recreati|on than us?&mdash;Becau&s;e they can afford to wa&s;te part of their time, which the poor cannot. Why has one man more &s;en&s;e, more abilities than ano|ther?
<PB N="6" REF="6">It is a gift and di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence. Some are born to rule, &s;ome to &s;erve. Was all mankind up|on an equality, the order of things would be overthrown, and life could not go on. Our Creator has ordain|ed that there &s;hall be different ranks and degrees of men. It has been &s;o from the beginning of time, and will continue to the end of it. It is not that a poor man is le&s;s re&s;pectable in <HI>his</HI> eyes than a rich man, if he ac|quits him&s;elf well in the &s;tate in which it has plea&s;ed God to place him; and a poor man never lo&s;es his con&s;equence in &s;ociety, but when he is di&s;orderly and does not fulfil the office a&s;&s;igned him. A poor man is equally re&s;pectable in &s;ociety al&s;o, if he is a u&s;eful member of it; and his equality with the rich is &s;hewn and &s;een by his u&s;efulne&s;s. As the &s;ervant cannot do without a ma&s;ter; &s;o the ma&s;ter cannot do without a &s;ervant; a good &s;ervant is always as valuable to a ma&s;ter, as a good ma|&s;ter is to a &s;ervant. They are equal in point of utility, as members of the &s;ame &s;ociety, and &s;ubjects of the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>I cannot &s;uppo&s;e any man of com|mon under&s;tanding can object to cer|tain di&s;tinctions of rank: if titles plea&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them, why not indulge them in their fancies, when they tend not to the injury of &s;ociety? They &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h old families, and when titles and honours are con|ferred for &s;ervices to the &s;tate, they become rewards and encouragements to &s;imilar &s;ervices. There might be political rea&s;ons for abol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hing titles in France: the nobility there were, as I have ob&s;erved, by their great privileges, exempt from certain laws that bound the re&s;t of the people, and were almo&s;t as de&s;potic as their monarch. Exalted then, and blown up by their rank, they not only looked down on the common people with contempt, but often treated them contemptuou&s;ly: in de&s;troy|ing therefore their privileges, it was thought prudent and politic to abo|li&s;h their rank al&s;o, to put them on an equality with their fellow-citi|zens, and thus prevent any future attempts in them to exalt them&s;elves again. With us, the ca&s;e is differ|ent, our nobility are amenable to the &s;ame laws as the poore&s;t man among us; they a&s;&s;ociate and inter-marry with commoners, and look up to commercial men with re&s;pect. Abo|li&s;hing titles then or rank is an object of no moment, much le&s;s of that magnitude as to &s;acrifice our con&s;ti|tution to acquire it.</P>
<P>Are Manors and manerial rights oppre&s;&s;ive? No. There are advan|tages in copyhold e&s;tates &s;uperior to freehold; if a man is di&s;po&s;ed to lend a &s;um of money on &s;uch an e&s;tate; he can, by examining the court roll, &s;ee if it is free from incumbrances, as he can in the ca&s;e of freeholds, in re|gi&s;tered counties. If a copyholder pays a heriot at his death, and a fine on alienation, that fine by law, can|not exceed the cu&s;tom of the manor, or two years rent of the e&s;tate, and in con&s;equence of the&s;e exactions, he who buys a copyhold e&s;tate pays le&s;s for the purcha&s;e, than if the e&s;tate was free. But if a copyholder is di&s;po&s;ed to pay the lord as much money as the e&s;tate would &s;ell for more, if free; there are few lords of manors but would free &s;uch e&s;tates, and the copyholder might be a freeholder when he plea&s;es. This con&s;idered, he has no more right to complain at not having a vote for the county, than the man who has no e&s;tate at all.</P>
<P>Is the Inequality of the land-tax an oppre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No. He who purcha&s;ed land where four &s;hillings in the pound is paid, boug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it at a le&s;s price than
<PB N="7" REF="7">he who purcha&s;ed where &s;ix-pence only is paid. Every thing fetches its real value; of cour&s;e there is no cau&s;e of complaint here.</P>
<P>Is the Inequality of repre&s;entation an oppre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No. There are large manufacturing towns, as Birming|ham, Sheffield, &amp;c. that &s;end no members to Parliament, nor have they a wi&s;h to do it under the pre|&s;ent mode of election, as it would create great confu&s;ion and di&s;turb|ance in &s;uch towns. They conceive them&s;elves &s;afe in the choice of their country men, and will leave their property under the guardian&s;hip of the Parliament cho&s;en by other peo|ple.</P>
<P>It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here to enter into the venality and corruption of Parliaments, or to &s;ay how far a more equal repre&s;entation, a more frequent choice of members, a more &s;ummary mode of election, or other reforms may be conducive to the greater happine&s;s of the people. Such have been long wi&s;hed for, and &s;uch a reform has been thought nece&s;&s;ary even by the pre&s;ent admi|ni&s;tration. But there is a time for all things; the time to enter into this is certainly not the pre&s;ent, when the minds of the people are di&s;turbed and when we are &s;urrounded by tu|mult. When &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;et about, quietne&s;s &s;hould reign among us, and the matter &s;hould be coolly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and ad|ju&s;ted. Was it to be entered into now, there is no knowing where things would end; it might end in the overthrow of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Is the Hou&s;e of Lords an oppre&s;|&s;ion?&mdash;No. "In the multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety." The Up|per Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of men of great landed property in this kingdom, who have a great deal to lo&s;e, and of cour&s;e a great deal to guard; men high in honour and under&s;tanding; of men well ver&s;ed by education in the laws of this country, and of men equally &s;o in the doctrines of chri&s;|tianity; and &s;urely &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly of men is proper to revi&s;e the acts of the people at large, pa&s;&s;ed in the lower hou&s;e of Parliament, that are to enact laws to &s;ecure our property and our religion. By our con&s;titution they cannot make laws them&s;elves, but they can either ratify or reject, and &s;urely we may tru&s;t to them who are equally intere&s;ted with us, and who have abundantly more at &s;take. If the&s;e men &s;ee no danger in the pre|&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, we &s;urely have no rea&s;on to be alarmed. They may &s;ay, as do the &s;ailors on board a &s;hip in a &s;torm, to the pa&s;&s;engers; Don't be afraid, look up to us&mdash;there is no occa&s;ion to be alarmed, till you &s;ee <HI>us</HI> &s;o."</P>
<P>Is the In&s;olence of tax-gatherers, or the &s;ervants of government an op|pre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;No. This, when it oc|curs, may be remedied by complaints made to their &s;uperiors in office; and any grievance an individual may la|bour under, by illegal &s;eizure of his property, if unrea&s;onable or unfair, is remedied by appeal.</P>
<P>I have now gone through every kind of complaint that the people have to urge, &s;hewn the ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e complaints, and that there is no &s;hadow of a plea for a change in our con&s;titution. Every thing can|not be done in a moment. Let us leave the remedies we wi&s;h to time, and the abilities of our repre&s;entatives. Con&s;ider what would be the con&s;e|quence of a commotion,&mdash;not only a great deal of blood&s;hed, but a great deal of dome&s;tic wretchedne&s;s in every family; di&s;tre&s;s would over&s;pread the land, and &s;laughter cloathe the whole country in <HI>black.</HI> Ca&s;t your eyes on the French nation&mdash;the people there are become warriors&mdash;there are few, if any, left to cultivate the land, and
<PB N="8" REF="8">if their importation of provi&s;ions and the nece&s;&s;aries of life was interrupted and &s;topped by foreign powers, as in all likelihood it may, they mu&s;t be &s;tarved into compliance. Look to their manufacturing towns; we are told that at Lyons there are 30,000 manufacturers, infirm men, women and children, who cannot carry arms, &s;tarving for want of employ; &s;o it will be with us.&mdash;There is not a man in trade, but &s;hould an in&s;urrection take place, would immediately feel a lo&s;s, and of cour&s;e his family would feel a want; and as to the men of property, tho&s;e who have mo&s;t to lo&s;e would be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. If then, my fellow-countrymen, you value your own ea&s;e and comfort; if your wives and children are dear to you, do not &s;acrifice the whole in &s;earch of a phantom you never can gra&s;p. Li&s;ten not to the mi&s;guided opinions of tho&s;e who&s;e ignorance is the be&s;t excu&s;e for their conduct. Things have gone on very well &s;ince we have lived in the world, and there is little doubt but that they will do the &s;ame whil&s;t we continue in it. The quieter a man pa&s;&s;es thro' life, the happier he is.</P>
