<SP>
<L>WHEN invalids po&s;&s;e&s;s both faith and wealth,</L>
<L>They'll find a no&s;trum to re&s;tore their health;</L>
<L>A <HI>panacea</HI> advertis'd to cure</L>
<L>Each ill the human body can endure.</L>
<L>But our bold Author claims a nobler art,</L>
<L>And adverti&s;es to relieve&mdash;the heart.</L>
<L>So many patients he expects to &s;ee,</L>
<L>That I'm appointed as his deputy.</L>
<L>Now, then, your mental maladies explain,</L>
<L>And I'll remove or mitigate the pain.</L>
<L>Does love or jealou&s;y your peace mole&s;t,</L>
<L>Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your brea&s;t?</L>
<L>For jealou&s;y, a &s;overeign balm behold,&mdash;</L>
<L>The hu&s;band's certain cure, a pill of gold;</L>
<L>This do&s;e, admini&s;ter'd with prudent care,</L>
<L>Di&s;pels at once the frailties of the fair;</L>
<L>Deprives the proctor of his <HI>crim. con.</HI> fee,</L>
<L>And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.</L>
<L>Should love torment &s;ome Romeo's heated brain,</L>
<L>Or agonize a Juliet's brea&s;t with pain,</L>
<L>Let them my potent remedy apply,&mdash;</L>
<L>The maid &s;hall cea&s;e to pine, the youth to &s;igh;</L>
<L>Gold &s;hall re&s;tore each drooping lover's health,</L>
<L>And pa&s;&s;ion &s;ind a &s;ub&s;titute in wealth.</L>
<L>But let not ill-tim'd ridicule degrade</L>
<L>What Heav'n, when well applied, a ble&s;&s;ing made.</L>
<L>To fo&s;ter merit, where&s;oever found,</L>
<L>And with improvement cheer a country round;</L>
<L>To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,</L>
<L>And &s;end the beggar happy from the door;</L>
<L>To mitigate the horrors of de&s;pair,</L>
<L>And make the family of want our care;</L>
<L>To &s;uccour genius, drooping in di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Making the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives to ble&s;s.</L>
<L>When the rich man can &s;uch employment find,</L>
<L>We wi&s;h his pur&s;e as ample as his mind.</L>
<L>For one poor patient I've an anxious fear;</L>
<L>And you mu&s;t be his kind phy&s;ician here.</L>
<L>Our Author has to night &s;o much at &s;take,</L>
<L>He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache!</L>
<L>But &s;hould his play a lib'ral audience plea&s;e,</L>
<L>Your warm applau&s;e will &s;et his heart at ea&s;e.</L>

<P>Now, good Frank, ea&s;e my tortur'd mind.&mdash;What of my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, your honour, Mr. Bronze came laughing out of dining-room, and &s;ays, "Daame, how the old Baronet has been roa&s;ted." So, fur, I not knowing what they could mean by roa&s;ting a Chri&s;tian, axed. "Why," &s;ays he, grinning. "they voted, that it was a pity the dignity of the bloody hand interfer'd, or the old beggar might &s;et up a &s;hop."</P>

<P>I heed not that.&mdash;But, when I forgive a father's wrongs&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;ays I, Domme, if young '&s;quire had been among them, he would have knocked all their heads together. Now wouldn't you, fur, have knock'd their heads together? Then they all laugh'd at me: which &s;omehow made all the blood in my body come into my knuckles. So &s;ays I, "Mr. Bronze, &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e me young '&s;quire Stanley&mdash;now, &s;ay that again about his ho|nour'd father."&mdash;So he did; and I lent him &s;uch a drive o'the feace&mdash;and I was knocking all their heads together pretty tighti&s;h&mdash;till the cook laid me flat wi' the poker: then they all fell upon me; and when I could &s;ight no longer, I fell a crying, and run to tell your honour.</P>

<L>SHAKESPEARE, a &s;hrewd old quiz, in his dull age,</L>

<L>He'd rather own that <HI>"all the world's a &s;hop."</HI></L>
<L>"And what's the trade?" exclaim the critic railers</L>
<L>Why, "Men and women all are merely taylors."</L>
<L>Nay, frown not, Beaux; and Ladies, do not pout</L>
