<P>THE following Appeal is not addre&s;&s;ed to the Pa&s;&s;ions, or to the People. Local expre&s;&s;ions, and even a technical manner, that may perplex and revolt a common Reader, have been unavoidable in a com|po&s;ition of this kind. It is a NARRATIVE OF FACTS, pre&s;ented to the Under&s;tand|ings and the Con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t concerned and be&s;t qualified to con|&s;ider them. It exhibits one great Example of that USURPATION of the Company's Servants, of that SPIRIT of DISOBEDIENCE, I had almo&s;t &s;aid REBELLION, which, while it threatens our Affairs in India with in&s;tant Ruin, holds forth a Soleci&s;m in Politics that is a Mockery of every Idea of Government and legal authority. Nor does this Ca&s;e &s;tand &s;ingle or unconnected; it was engen|dered by much Mi&s;chief that went before, and was pregnant with more that followed; a full Account of which &s;hall be &s;ubmitted, in due time, to the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;la|ture, and the impartial judgment of the Public.</P>

<P>WHEN Gen. Clavering, Col. Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis, arrived in Bengal, they found the Nabob Mahomed Reza Cawn, who had for many years filled the fir&s;t offices of the &s;tate, in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and living in a &s;mall mi&s;erable hou&s;e near Calcutta, a pri|&s;oner at large. He had been dive&s;ted of his employments, and brought down a pri&s;oner to Calcutta, in a manner the mo&s;t di&s;graceful to a per&s;on of his high rank, &s;oon after Mr. Ha&s;t|ings's acce&s;&s;ion to the Government in May 1772. Various charges were then brought again&s;t him of embezzlement, mal-admini&s;tration, &amp;c. and
<PB N="2" REF="6">
particularly of being concerned in monopolies, which contributed to the famine. On the&s;e charges he was publicly tried by the Pre&s;ident and Council: And notwith&s;tanding the known and avowed di&s;po&s;ition of the Court of Direc|tors (as con&s;tituted at that time) to accompli&s;h his ruin; and in &s;pite of the influence of the Government in Bengal, he was honourably ac|quitted, but not rein&s;tated. His accu&s;ers, and their abettors, irritated at their defeat, left this great and good man, (for &s;uch he is, if ever a native of India de&s;erved that character) over|whelmed with debts, and ruined by his long at|tendance in Calcutta, to peri&s;h in mi&s;ery and oblivion; that is, to &s;uffer all the penalties, except lo&s;s of honour, which could have been inflicted upon him, if his innocence had not been e&s;tabli&s;hed as clear as the Sun.</P>
<P>In this condition he remained until the Com|pany's orders of the 3d of March, 1775, were received by the Governor General and Council. In their letter of that date they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that they are well plea&s;ed in finding him able to excul|pate him&s;elf from all the charges brought again&s;t him, to the &s;atisfaction of their &s;er|vants."</Q> They &s;ay they can have no objection to his total enlargement; and, in the end, they direct, that <Q REND="inline">"if he can, with propriety, accept of the office of Roy Royan, he &s;hould be forthwith appointed thereto."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
On the 18th of October, 1775, the Gover|nor General and Council con&s;idering the general intent of the preceding orders, and ob&s;erving that the Court of Directors had fallen into a mi&s;take with re&s;pect to the office of Roy Royan, which could not be held by a Mu&s;&s;ulman, de|termined to recommend Mahomed Reza Cawn to that of Naib Subadar, on the &s;ame principles which the Company them&s;elves had adopted, and preci&s;ely on the plan which they had po|&s;itively ordered to be pur&s;ued, in their letter of the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1771, for the admini&s;|&s;tration of the affairs of the country govern|ment. The re&s;olution of the Board was oppo&s;ed by Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Barwell, but highly approved of by the Court of Directors. In their letter of the 24th of December, 1776, they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"That his abilities have been &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted; that official experience qualifies him for &s;o high a &s;tation, in a more eminent degree than any other native with whom the Company has been connected: That, as no proofs of mal-admini&s;tration have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed again&s;t him, during the &s;trict inve&s;ti|gation of his conduct, or &s;ince his retire|ment, they cannot but approve of the Board's recommendation of him to the Nabob, to con|&s;titute him his Naib: That they are well plea&s;ed at his having received that appoint|ment; and that they authorize the Board to a&s;&s;ure him of their favour."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">
On the 23d of February, 1778, a letter, in the name of the young Nabob, Mobarick ul Dowla, notoriou&s;ly fabricated at Calcutta, was produced at the Board. In this letter he is made to a&s;&s;ert, that he is arrived at years of maturity, and to demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the offices held by Mahomed Reza Cawn. The 2d of March was appointed, by agreement, for taking it into con&s;ideration. On that day it was re&s;olved, by a majority of the members pre&s;ent, that the Nabob's letter &s;hould be re|ferred to the Court of Directors for their deter|mination.</P>
<P>On the 5th of March, the preceding re&s;olu|tion was rever&s;ed by the ca&s;ting voice of Mr. Ha&s;tings, united with that of Mr. Barwell, who attended; and all the Nabob's requi&s;itions com|plied with.</P>
<P>On the 4th of May, the Nabob wrote to the Governor to inform him, that he had ap|pointed Sudder ul Hoc Cawn (a poor &s;uper|annuated dependant of Mr. Ha&s;tings) to be his Naib, and Raja Gourdas (the &s;on of Nun|comar) to the office of the Nizamut. He al&s;o de&s;ired that the &s;alary allotted by the Company to the &s;upport of a Mini&s;ter of the Government, and lately enjoyed by Mahomed Reza Cawn, might be di&s;tributed in the following manner:</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>To his mother-in-law, Munny Begum,</CELL>
<CELL>72,000,0</CELL>

<ROW>
<CELL>Sicca Rupees,</CELL>
<CELL>2,58,000,0</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that this &s;um exceeds the amount of Mahomed Reza Cawn's &s;alary by 18,000 rupees, which the Nabob de|&s;ires may be given by the Board, in order that his own revenues may &s;uffer no diminution.</P>
<P>On the 11th of May, 1778, all the&s;e reque&s;ts were complied with by the majority. The Company's orders, on the parts of this tran&s;ac|tion which had come to their knowledge, were received at Calcutta the 13th of November, 1779. The following extracts from their letter of the 4th of February, 1779, contain an exact copy of them.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of Company's General Letter to Bengal, dated <DATE>the 4th February, 1779.</DATE> No. I.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 8.</HEAD>
<P>We by no means approve your late proceed|ings on the application of the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah for the removal of the Naib Soubah|dah. The requi&s;ition of Mobareck ul Dowlah was improper and unfriendly, becau&s;e he mu&s;t have known, that the late appointment of Mohamed Reza Kawn to the office of Naib Subahdah [Mini&s;|ter] had been marked with the Company's &s;pe|cial approbation, and that the Court of Direc|tors had a&s;&s;ured him of their favour, &s;o long as a firm attachment to the Company's intere&s;t, and a proper di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation, would render him worthy of their protection. We therefore repeat our declaration, that to re|quire the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a prime mini&s;ter thus circum&s;tanced, without producing the &s;malle&s;t proof of his infidelity to the Company, or ven|turing to charge him with one in&s;tance of mal-admini&s;tration in the di&s;charge of his public duty, was improper and incon&s;i&s;tent with the friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Nabob of Ben|gal and the Company.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 9.</HEAD>
<P>Admitting the Nabob's complaint, that Ma|homet Reza Kawn is not connected with him by
<PB N="7" REF="11">
relative ties, to be well founded, it by no means follows that he has been deficient in duty or &s;in|cere attachment to him, or that his power is op|pre&s;&s;ive and di&s;honourable to the Nabob and his family; nor can a&s;&s;ertions of this nature, unat|tended by proof, have any weight with us.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 10.</HEAD>
<P>In regard to the Nabob's claim, to take charge of his own affairs merely becau&s;e he is of age and thinks him&s;elf capable of conducting them, we find it declared by one of your mem|bers and not contradicted, that he knew with certainty, that the Nabob is in his own per&s;on utterly incapable of executing any of tho&s;e of|fices which were deemed of e&s;&s;ential importance to the welfare of the country; and we are &s;orry to find that neither this declaration, nor the Pro|te&s;ts of two Members of the Council, &s;eem to have been thought worthy of an an&s;wer by the majority of the Board.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 11.</HEAD>
<P>The Nabob hopes from your favour and ju&s;|tice, to be delivered from the authority of Ma|homet Reza Khan. He ventures to declare the Company &s;olely indebted to the warm &s;upport of his ance&s;tors for their pre&s;ent greatne&s;s and advantages. He claims the management and admini&s;tration of the Soubahdarrie as his right, and &s;ays it will be highly inequitable in the Com|pany to refu&s;e their approbation to his reque&s;t.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="paragraph">
<PB N="8" REF="12">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 12.</HEAD>
<P>We pa&s;s over the&s;e extraordinary &s;ugge&s;tions of the Nabob without reply; only ob&s;erving, that in ju&s;tice to him and our&s;elves, we mu&s;t take the be&s;t care in our power of the peace and internal good government of the country; and we are not di&s;po&s;ed to hazard the effects which might be occa&s;ioned by committing the entire management thereof to his inexperience, without enjoining him to accept &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to employ &s;uch mini&s;ters about his per&s;on, as may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary on the part of the India Company.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 13.</HEAD>
<P>The 23d of February we find the Nabob's letter and a que&s;tion thereon was circulated to the different members of the Board for their opi|nions to be taken at the next meeting of Coun|cil, which meeting happened on the 2d March; but one of the members being indi&s;po&s;ed, did not attend at that Board.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="14" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 14.</HEAD>
<P>We have carefully noticed your debates upon the &s;ubject. The re&s;olution of Council of that day, that the Nabob's letter &s;hould be referred to the Court of Directors, for their deci&s;ion, and that no re&s;olution &s;hould be taken in Ben|gal on his requi&s;itions without our &s;pecial orders and in&s;tructions, appears to us very proper:
<PB N="9" REF="13">
we mu&s;t therefore expre&s;s our di&s;approbation on finding the &s;aid re&s;olution re&s;cinded, on the frivolous pleas urged by the majority of the Board three days afterwards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="15" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 15.</HEAD>
<P>If the ab&s;ence of a member of Council were &s;ufficient to preclude the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of any &s;ub|ject which might have been referred for con|&s;ideration by a former Board, or to invalidate re&s;olutions taken during &s;uch ab&s;ence, it would be in the power of any member effectually to defeat the ends propo&s;ed by the in&s;titution of a Council, and to put a total &s;top to public bu&s;i|ne&s;s. We &s;hall not wa&s;te time in refuting claims of privilege advanced on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e they appear to us unworthy of con&s;ideration, and beneath all argument.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="16" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 16.</HEAD>
<P>The Nabob having intimated that he had re|peatedly &s;tated the trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s which he had &s;uffered from the Naib&s;hip of the Niza|mut being ve&s;ted in Mahomed Reza Khan, we ob&s;erve one of the members of your Board de|&s;ired the Nabob's repeated letters on the &s;ubject might be read; but this rea&s;onable reque&s;t was over-ruled, on a plea of &s;aving the Board's time, which we can by no means admit as a &s;ufficient objection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="17" TYPE="paragraph">
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 17.</HEAD>
<P>The Nabob's letters of the 25th and 30th of Augu&s;t, of the 3d of September and 17th of November, leave us no doubt of the true de|&s;ign of this extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s being to bring forward the Munny Begum, and again to inve&s;t her with improper power and influence, not|with&s;tanding our former declarations, that &s;o great a part of the Nabob's allowance had been embezzled or mi&s;applied under her &s;uperinten|dance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="18" TYPE="paragraph">
<HEAD>PARAGRAPH 18.</HEAD>
<P>In&s;tead of your declaring that the Nabob's demands were grounded on po&s;itive rights, which will not admit of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; that the Nizamut is his inheritance; that the dependants of the Nizamut, Adawlet, and Phou&s;darry ap|pertain to that inheritance; that as he is plea&s;ed to demand and a&s;&s;ert the po&s;itive rights of his office as Nizam of the provinces, there is no ground for denying his reque&s;t; and that a re|ference to the Company would be an eva&s;ion unbecoming the honour of government, the Nabob might have been reminded that a Naib Subahdar was appointed, and the office conti|nued without interruption or objection during the government of his ance&s;tors, who mu&s;t have been &s;uppo&s;ed more capable of governing the provinces than a youth of twenty years of age.</P>

<DIV3 N="19" TYPE="paragraph">

<P>You have reque&s;ted this unexperienced young man to permit all the pre&s;ent Judges and Of|ficers of the Nizamut and Foujedarry, Adawlets, or courts of criminal ju&s;tice; and al&s;o all the Foujedars or officers appointed to guard the peace of the country to continue in office until he, the Nabob, &s;hall have formed a plan for a new arrangement of tho&s;e officers; and it is with equal &s;urprize and concern that we ob&s;erve this reque&s;t introduced, and the Nabob's o&s;ten&s;ible rights &s;o &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted at this period by our Governor General, becau&s;e, on a late occa&s;ion, to &s;erve a very different purpo&s;e, he has not &s;crupled to declare it as vi&s;ible as the light of the &s;un, that the Nabob is a mere pageant, and without even the &s;hadow of authority. No circum&s;tance has happened &s;ince that declaration was made to render the Nabob more inde|pendent, nor to give him any degree of power or con&s;equence; you mu&s;t therefore have been well apprized that your late conce&s;&s;ions to Mobareck ul Dowlah were unnece&s;&s;ary, and as &s;uch unwarrantable.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> I move that the Company's orders, for the immediate rein&s;tatement of Ma|homed Reza Cawn in the offices he held in January 1778, be carried into execution, and that a copy of the la&s;t paragraph of the Com|pany's letter of the 4th of February 1779, toge|ther with an exact Per&s;ian tran&s;lation thereof, be tran&s;mitted to the Nabob Mobarruck ul Dowla, and to Mahomed Reza Cawn, with a requi&s;i|tion on the part of the Governor General and Council to the Nabob, to conform to the in|junctions of the Court of Directors expre&s;&s;ed in that paragraph. This motion of cour&s;e &s;up|po&s;es that the Governor General &s;hall be re|que&s;ted to &s;ignify the re&s;olution of the Board on this &s;ubject, in the u&s;ual manner, by Letter to the Nabob.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18"><HI>Mr. Wheeler.</HI> I agree to the motion.</P>
<P><HI>Governor General.</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave to decline an immediate an&s;wer to the motion, which I will deliver at our next meeting, which it has been agreed &s;hall be held to-morrow morning.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> I mu&s;t beg that a formal re&s;o|&s;olution on the motion may be taken now. It could not be unexpected, and the more &s;o, as I particularly reque&s;ted Mr. Barwell to &s;tay. I cannot therefore be &s;u&s;pected of want of can|dor in pre&s;&s;ing for the re&s;olution now. I came determined to propo&s;e it.</P>
<P><HI>Governor General.</HI> Since Mr. Francis, taking an advantage of the ab&s;ence of one of the mem|bers, has in&s;i&s;ted on an immediate deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion, I am compelled to give my affir|mative or negative to it. I have declared that I am not come prepared to deliver my opinion upon a &s;ubject of &s;o much delicacy, and in|volving &s;o many con&s;equences. I &s;hould have been glad to have been allowed &s;ome time to con&s;ider the nature and tendency of the order, and to have accommodated the execution of it to all the circum&s;tances which ought to be taken into con&s;ideration in the determination upon it: the time that I have required is but the &s;hort interval between this hour of three in the after|noon, and the hour of ten to-morrow morning;
<PB N="15" REF="19">
however, as this privilege is now denied me, I &s;hall in this place, and at this time, &s;imply content my&s;elf with delivering my negative to the motion in the terms in which it is made.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> I could have no idea of avail|ing my&s;elf of Mr. Barwell's ab&s;ence. Every Gentleman at the Board I believe heard me &s;olicit him to &s;tay; much le&s;s could I have a view of &s;urprizing the Governor General on a &s;ubject on which he might be unprepared. The Company's Letter was received on Saturday the 13th in&s;tant, though it has happened that I my|&s;elf did not &s;ee it till Friday la&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>The Governor General.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary that this form &s;hould be ob&s;erved in every in&s;tance. It is always &s;uppo&s;ed, when the Members of the Board tacitly agree to the omi&s;&s;ion of it, the for|mular preface of every con&s;ultation being &s;uffi|cient to imply it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wheler.</HI> The minutes of every Board or Public A&s;&s;embly that I have had the honour to attend, are con&s;tantly read at a &s;ub&s;equent meet|ing of &s;uch Board or A&s;&s;embly, in order that
<PB N="18" REF="22">
every member may be fully &s;atisfied that what he has &s;aid or entered upon the records is faith|fully repre&s;ented or tran&s;cribed. But I know not a &s;ingle in&s;tance when the minutes of any Board or A&s;&s;embly have been read at a &s;ub&s;e|quent meeting with a view to over&s;et the re&s;olu|tions of a former meeting; if that was admitted in numerous a&s;&s;emblies, no que&s;tion could ever be finally decided. The objection, in my opi|nion, if it is &s;o meant, holds equally &s;trong, and I am convinced will be treated with equal di&s;gu&s;t by our &s;uperiors, as they have already treated an act not very di&s;&s;imilar to this.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> The re&s;olution taken ye&s;terday was legal and compleat; it wants no confirmation, though it may be rever&s;ed. The official form ob&s;erved in the proceedings of a former Go|vernment, and continued under ours, is merely a form; and &s;o little is it ever regarded, that the orders of one Council are con&s;tantly executed, if the time permits, before the meeting of the next.</P>
<P>Mr. Wheler has a&s;&s;igned the true and only rea&s;on for the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch a form: what|ever u&s;e or convenience there may be in continu|ing to ob&s;erve it, it cannot operate again&s;t a po&s;itive provi&s;ion of an act of Parliament, made &s;ince the form in que&s;tion was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and
<PB N="19" REF="23">
which, of cour&s;e, &s;uper&s;edes it, if in reality it had ever had the effect and operation which the Governor General now attributes to it.&mdash;The law &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, wherein any difference of opinion &s;hall ari&s;e upon any que&s;tion propo&s;ed in any con&s;ulta|tion, the Governor General and Council &s;hall be bound and concluded by the opinion and deci&s;ion of the major part of tho&s;e pre|&s;ent."</Q>&mdash;The conclu&s;ion, by which the Council is bound, is in&s;tant and ab&s;olute; there is no reference to the confirmation of a &s;ub|&s;equent meeting. I am &s;orry the Governor General &s;hould repeat an objection, already, as I think, compleatly an&s;wered. I am not to blame if Mr. Barwell, notwith&s;tanding my ur|gent reque&s;t to the contrary, left the Board ye&s;|terday at an early hour. I &s;hould have been much better plea&s;ed if he had &s;taid, becau&s;e I &s;hould then have had the labour of one debate only, in&s;tead of two. On this &s;ubject I need &s;ay nothing more, &s;ince the Court of Directors them&s;elves have taken it up in a &s;imilar in&s;tance, and given their opinion decidedly upon it, in the 15th paragraph of the letter now before us.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Barwell.</HI> Had the re&s;olution &s;imply gone to the execution of the Company's orders, from the &s;entiments delivered by the Governor General at the la&s;t meeting, the pre&s;ent que&s;tion would not have been agitated. His objection
<PB N="20" REF="24">
to Mr. Francis's motion &s;trikes me as confined to the mode that motion pre&s;cribes for carrying tho&s;e orders into execution. Mr. Francis's mo|tion, in my opinion, conveys &s;uch &s;entiments as are not authorized by the Company's letter. In the body of the motion I find the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"with a requi&s;ition of the Governor General and Council to the Nabob, to conform to the injunctions of the Court of Directors."</Q> I know of no injunctions that the Court have laid on the Nabob, and I imagine the u&s;e of any offen|&s;ive terms or improper management on a &s;ubject of &s;o delicate a nature, would be highly repre|hen&s;ible. I therefore vote for re&s;cinding the re&s;olution of the la&s;t Council, &s;o far as regards the mode of executing the orders of the Coun|cil, but no farther. I agree to the motion, that the order be executed, but am for leaving the manner of doing it to the di&s;cretion of the Go|vernor General. From nothing that the Go|vernor General has urged in the cour&s;e of the debate of ye&s;terday, do I perceive the lea&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition in him to decline the in&s;tructions which the Court of Directors have been plea&s;ed to give relative to a Naib Soubah.</P>
<P><HI>Governor General.</HI> With all the re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which I owe and feel for the autho|rity of the Court of Directors, I mu&s;t declare, that I &s;hall not yield, even to that authority, in any in&s;tance, in which it &s;hall require my con|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="21" REF="25">
of the rights which I hold under an act of Parliament. Tho&s;e rights are formal obli|gations, with which I am not permitted to di&s;|pen&s;e; neither can I optionally relinqui&s;h my own claim to a practice which was followed by Mr. Francis him&s;elf, when he formed one of the majority of the Council, and which receives the approbation of the Court of Directors them|&s;elves. I acknowledge the obligation I owe to Mr. Francis for the trouble he has taken in helping me to one in&s;tance in con&s;ultations 14th September 1775, in which a re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed at the preceding con&s;ultations, which was contrary to the &s;en&s;e and general tenor of the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by the ruling members of the Board, was re&s;cinded by a following motion, for|mally introduced and made by my&s;elf. If this mode is illegal or irregular, it was equally &s;o as at that time; but Mr. Francis then made no objection to it, but, in the opinion deli|vered upon my motion, &s;imply &s;aid, He thought the order &s;hould be repeated. I recollect al&s;o, that in a &s;imilar in&s;tance motions were made, either by Mr. Francis or by the other members of the majority in concert with him, for read|ing and confirming the proceedings held by them during the ab&s;ence of Mr. Barwell and my|&s;elf, both in this and in the revenue department. I will not take up the time of the Board in look|ing out for the in&s;tances, but &s;hall de&s;ire the
<PB N="22" REF="26">
&s;ecretary to annex them to this minute. The evident intent of the&s;e motions was to authen|ticate all the acts which were con&s;idered by the members of the majority as the legal acts of the Board, but were di&s;puted and di&s;avowed by Mr. Barwell and my&s;elf; and, by obtaining &s;uch a formal approbation of them, to remove the ob|jections which had been made, or which might lie again&s;t their validity. Re&s;pecting the que|&s;tion now before the Board, I di&s;approve of the Re&s;olution, as not being warranted by the Or|ders of the Court of Directors; and I think it would be di&s;ingenuous and unju&s;t in this Board to exceed the po&s;itive orders of the Company, in annulling a conce&s;&s;ion made by them to the Nabob, and acknowledged as his due.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> The Governor General has very fully proved a propo&s;ition which has never been di&s;puted; that a re&s;olution taken at one Board may be rever&s;ed at the next. I mu&s;t have lo&s;t my memory and my &s;en&s;es if I had denied it. I do not make profe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch extraordinary candour, as to furni&s;h an opponent with argu|ments again&s;t my&s;elf. In pointing out to the Governor General the con&s;ultation of the 15th September 1775, I meant to give him an in|&s;tance in point, which I thought e&s;tabli&s;hed a conclu&s;ion directly the rever&s;e of that which he has drawn from it. The Court of Directors will find, in the proceedings of that day, that I entered a Di&s;&s;ent and Prote&s;t again&s;t a Re&s;olution
<PB N="23" REF="27">
taken at the preceding Council, but that I nei|ther di&s;puted its validity, nor propo&s;ed to re|ver&s;e, or even to recon&s;ider it. The propo&s;ition for that purpo&s;e came from the Governor Gene|ral him&s;elf, and was &s;trictly regular and legal. It would have been in point had he proved that, in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, I in&s;i&s;ted that the re&s;olu|tion of the preceding day wanted the confirma|tion of the next, and that on that ground I had propo&s;ed to recon&s;ider it. With re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, the in&s;tance proves nothing. In the other examples quoted by the Governor General, and which I perfectly remember, the fact was this: The legality of the &s;eparate meet|ings held by General Clavering, Colonel Mon|&s;on, and my&s;elf was expre&s;sly and formally de|nied. That rea&s;on alone, I pre&s;ume, induced General Clavering to propo&s;e, and Colonel Mon|&s;on and my&s;elf to agree, that the re&s;olutions taken in &s;uch &s;eparate meetings &s;hould be con|firmed at the next full meeting of the Board. Whether &s;uch confirmation was nece&s;&s;ary or not, the example does not &s;upport the Governor Ge|neral's argument. The que&s;tion now is, Whe|ther acts done at a meeting of the Board confe&s;|&s;edly regular and legal, require any &s;ub&s;equent confirmation; not, Whether &s;uch meeting was or was not in it&s;elf legal. But, &s;etting a&s;ide this &s;ort of argument; precedents prove nothing again&s;t a po&s;itive right, e&s;pecially where that
<PB N="24" REF="28">
right it&s;elf is not in i&s;&s;ue. We may go on for any length of time, by negligence or agreement, in following forms which nobody regards. The que&s;tion is not fairly in i&s;&s;ue, until they are for|mally in&s;i&s;ted upon and denied, and &s;ome im|portant u&s;e attempted to be made of them. If the motion I made ye&s;terday did not corre&s;pond with the Governor General's idea of the &s;en&s;e of the Company's orders, I &s;hould have held my&s;elf indebted to him for any amendment he might have thought fit to propo&s;e; and a&s;&s;uredly I &s;hould have given it the mo&s;t re&s;pectful atten|tion. The profound &s;ilence he ob&s;erved made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to judge whether his objec|tion went to the whole of the motion, or to any part of it, or merely to the form propo&s;ed of car|rying the Company's orders into execution.</P>
<P><HI>Governor General.</HI> Whatever doubts were en|tertained of the legality of the acts done by a part of the Board, after my declaration of the di&s;&s;olution of the actual meeting, the&s;e doubts were not entertained by Mr. Francis, who de|clared the acts to be legal; therefore, with re&s;pect to him, the &s;ub&s;equent motion and order, to read and approve their proceedings, could not be con&s;trued as intended to give them that le|gality which they wanted, though they might be covertly intended &s;o, by the application of an ancient con&s;titutional form to that effect. But
<PB N="25" REF="29">
I will here clo&s;e my part of the argument, &s;ince I perceive that we di&s;pute only on words, Mr. Francis admitting that a re&s;olution taken at one Board may be rever&s;ed at the next. I offer to his option that motion which I have already made, or the motion which I now make, That the former re&s;olution be rever&s;ed. And I hereby declare my opinion for rever&s;ing the former re&s;olution. Mr. Barwell has already done it in terms. I confe&s;s that in this pro|po&s;al I am irregular, but I had rather incur that imputation than &s;uffer the time of the Board to be any longer wa&s;ted by a fruitle&s;s and a verbal di&s;pute.</P>
<P>In this place I &s;hall beg leave to contra&s;t my own conduct with Mr. Francis's; that, &s;ince I have been a member of this or any other go|vernment, I have never, in one &s;ingle in&s;tance, if I may tru&s;t to my own memory, and the fulle&s;t conviction of what I a&s;&s;ert, de&s;cended to a practice which I &s;hould have held unworthy of my own principles, of which I have had too frequent occa&s;ion to complain in Mr. Francis, by taking the advantage of an occa&s;ional and accidental majority to carry any mea&s;ure con|trary to the &s;en&s;e of the ruling members. Even in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which I have quoted, I introduced a que&s;tion, for the &s;ake of giving con&s;i&s;tency to the orders of the Board, although it was productive, and &s;o intended, of the repeal
<PB N="26" REF="30">
of a re&s;olution of the Board, which had received my concurrence at the former meeting of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> I object to both the motions, though for different rea&s;ons. I object to rever|&s;ing the re&s;olution of the la&s;t Board, becau&s;e I deem it a mo&s;t unwarrantable exerci&s;e of a power, the exi&s;tence of which I am obliged to admit. No &s;pecific rea&s;on is yet a&s;&s;igned for it. To the latter part of the Governor General's la&s;t minute I &s;hall only &s;ay, that I hope I &s;hall not always &s;uffer in a compari&s;on between his prin|ciples of action and mine. If he has had <HI>too frequent</HI> occa&s;ion to complain of my taking ad|vantage of accidental majorities, the word <HI>fre|quent</HI> mu&s;t refer to more in&s;tances than two. It will re&s;t with him to produce more in&s;tances, if there are any. I my&s;elf know of none, in which he has lo&s;t any que&s;tion by Mr. Barwell's ab&s;ence, but that of the one before us, and the former one of the 2d of March 1778, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. The re&s;olution which the Go|vernor General propo&s;ed to have recon&s;idered on the 14th of Sept. 1775, interrupted a &s;eries of mea&s;ures formed on a different principle. I think he did right in propo&s;ing to recon&s;ider it. This is a &s;ingle act, which has no connection with any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the re&s;olution of ye&s;terday be rever&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="31">
<HI>The Governor General</HI> moves, <Q REND="inline">"That the plea|&s;ure of the Court of Directors, &s;ignified in the 20th Paragraph of the general letter of the 4th February la&s;t, and the a&s;&s;urance therein directed to be given to Mahomed Reza Cawn, be communicated to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah in the words of the general letter."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> I have no objection to the mo|tion as far as it goes; but, if the communica|tion of the Company's intentions be not accom|panied by a formal requi&s;ition from this govern|ment, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that they may be de|feated. I therefore move the following addition to the motion, <Q REND="inline">"That the Governor General be reque&s;ted to &s;ignify to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah, in the u&s;ual form, the requi&s;ition of the Governor General and Council, for his immediate compliance with the plea&s;ure of the Court of Directors."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wheeler.</HI> I agree to the motion, and like|wi&s;e to the amendment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Barwell.</HI> I agree to the motion. I can|not be a judge of the terms that Mr. Francis would have u&s;ed in the letter propo&s;ed to be written by the Governor General to the Nabob from the general terms in which his amendment is expre&s;&s;ed. The Governor General can have
<PB N="28" REF="32">
no objection to &s;ubmit the terms, in which he makes the communication of the Company's &s;entiments to the Nabob and Mahomed Reza Cawn, to the Board before the letters &s;hall be &s;ent. If tho&s;e are at all defective, &s;uch addi|tions may be propo&s;ed to them, as, in the judg|ment of any of the members, may appear nece&s;|&s;ary. I think Mr. Francis is premature in fol|lowing the Governor General's motion with another. It &s;eems to &s;peak &s;ome preknowledge of the difficulties to which our government is &s;ubjected, and that no &s;mall degree of coercion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;upport the recommendations of the Company. I give my vote &s;imply for the Governor General's motion, re&s;erving my opinion for any amendments that may be offered to the letters propo&s;ed to be written, when &s;uch are offered in preci&s;e terms, as e&s;&s;ential to an&s;wer the intentions of the Company, and con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e intentions.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> The motion is confined to a bare communication of the Company's orders; how it may operate I do not know; but, as this government is the medium through which all the Company's orders are carried into execu|tion, it &s;eems to me unu&s;ual at lea&s;t, to leave them, in this &s;ingle in&s;tance, to execute them|&s;elves. As for the re&s;t, I have no di&s;tru&s;t of the Nabob, and hope he will comply with them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"><HI>Governor General.</HI> I agree to the que&s;tion. I object to the amendment. My rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned in the preceding minutes; I will not therefore repeat them.</P>

The authority of the Court of Direc|tors over the government of the&s;e provinces (which in effect is that of the nation over a de|pendent dominion) does not act directly and immediately on the things or per&s;ons &s;ubject to it in India, but always through the medium of their local repre&s;entatives.

<P>My Patron! When the afore&s;aid Nabob was fir&s;t appointed to the Naib Subah&s;hip, it was en|tirely on this account, that by rea&s;on of my tender age I could not tran&s;act my own affairs in per&s;on, but required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Naib. When I became of age there was no further oc|ca&s;ion for a Naib, and I accordingly wrote you on the &s;ubject, and informed you that I would
<PB N="32" REF="36">
take on my&s;elf the management of my own affairs, and had no further u&s;e for a Naib; and as this was perfectly rea&s;onable, you, in council, gave your &s;anction thereto, and favoured me with a letter, authorizing me to take the admi|ni&s;tration on my&s;elf, and to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;aid Na|bob, which was accordingly done; and from that time to the pre&s;ent, the affairs of the Ni|zamut, Foujedaree, and Adaulet dependant on the Nizamut have been conducted on that plan by my authority. The letter lately received from the Court of Directors, &s;ignifying their plea&s;ure that the &s;aid Nabob be re&s;tored to the Naib Subah&s;hip, fills me with the greate&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hment, nor can I penetrate the motive of it. Perhaps the circum&s;tance of my having arrived at years of maturity has not yet reached the ears of the Court of Directors in Europe; and not|with&s;tanding the number of children and de|pendents which I have, they &s;till reckon me an infant; otherwi&s;e would they have determined to place my family under the authority of ano|ther, and written you for that purpo&s;e? In a word, it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould inform you of my &s;ituation, which I formerly did; and it depended on you to tran&s;mit &s;uch information to the Court of Directors.</P>
<P>It is notorious that the meane&s;t of the people will not admit of the authority of a &s;tranger in their families, how can it then be expected of
<PB N="33" REF="37">
me? In a word, I admini&s;ter the affairs of the Nizamut, which are in fact the affairs of my own family, by my own authority, and &s;hall do &s;o; and I can never, on any account, agree to the appointment of the &s;aid Nabob to the Naib Subah&s;hip, which would bring the greate&s;t di&s;|honour, di&s;grace, and contempt on me. I will never, of my own con&s;ent, admit the &s;aid Nabob to any authority in the affairs of the Nizamut, Foujedaree, and Adawlet, dependant on the Nizamut; and from motives of ju&s;tice I expect, that regarding the rights which my late father is allowed to have had on the Company, you will never con&s;ent that any compul&s;ion be put in practice again&s;t me on account of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and that you will u&s;e every means for the pre&s;ervation of my credit, honour, and dignity.</P>

<P>On the 7th of March 1773, a letter from the Governor informs the Nabob, that <Q REND="inline">"it had been agreed, that his Excellency being now arrived at years of maturity, the control of his own hou&s;ehold, and of the Courts dependent on the Nizamut and Phouzdarry, &s;hould be placed in his hands, and Mahomed Reza Khan was directed at the &s;ame time to re&s;ign his autho|rity to the Nabob."</Q></P>

<P>Sudder ul Hoc Khan, in a letter received 30th September, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Yatibar Ally Cawn, Munny Begum's chief Eunuch, from the amount of the &s;alaries of the officers of the Adawlet and Phouz|darry, which before my arrival he had received for two months from the Sircar, made di&s;|bur&s;ements according to his own plea&s;ure.

I mention this for your information."</Q></P>
<P>The Governor General's letter to the Nabob, dated the 10th of October 1778, contains a re|pre&s;entation &s;o pointed, and &s;o very ju&s;t, of the fatal effects which had attended the Nabob's in|terfering in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, that I &s;hall in&s;ert it intire, but without any comment; in fact it &s;peaks too plainly to require one.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="42"><Q REND="inline"><P>"At your Excellency's reque&s;t, I &s;ent Sud|der ul Hoc Khan to take on him the admini&s;tra|tion of the affairs of the Adawlet and Phouz|darry, and hoped by that means not only to have given &s;atisfaction to your Excellency, but that, through his abilities and experience, the&s;e affairs would have been conducted in &s;uch a manner as to have &s;ecured the peace of the coun|try, and the happine&s;s of the people; and it is with the greate&s;t concern I learn, that this mea|&s;ure is &s;o far from being attended with the expect|ed advantages, that the affairs both of the Phouz|darry and Adawlet are in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable, and daily robberies and murders are perpetrated throughout the country.</P>
<P>This is evidently owing to the want of a pro|per authority in the per&s;on appointed to &s;uper|intend them. I therefore addre&s;&s;ed your Excel|lency on the importance and delicacy of the affairs in que&s;tion, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of lodging full power in the hands of the per&s;on cho&s;en to admini&s;ter them. In reply to which, your Ex|cellency expre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments coincident with mine; notwith&s;tanding which, your dependents and people, actuated by &s;elfi&s;h and avaritious views, have, by their interference, &s;o impeded the bu&s;ine&s;s, as to throw the whole country into a &s;tate of confu&s;ion, from which nothing can re|trieve it but an unlimited power lodged in the hands of the &s;uperintendant. I therefore reque&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="43">
that your Excellency will give the &s;tricte&s;t in|junctions to all your dependents not to interfere in any manner with any matter relative to the affairs of the Adawlet and Phouzdarry; and that you will your&s;elf relinqui&s;h all interference therein, and leave them intirely to the manage|ment of Sudder ul Hoc Khan. This is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the country to a &s;tate of tranquillity: and if your Excellency has any plan to propo&s;e for the management of the affairs in future, be plea&s;ed to communicate it to me, and every attention &s;hall be paid to give your Excellency &s;atisfaction. In the mean time, I have given directions to Sudder ul Hoc Khan to take the &s;ole management of them into his own hands, and to apply a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to the re&s;to|ration of tranquillity and good order in the coun|try: and I mu&s;t reque&s;t that your Excellency will confirm them by &s;imilar orders to him, otherwi&s;e a mea&s;ure which I adopted at your Excellen|cy's reque&s;t, and with a view to your &s;ati&s;|faction and the benefit of the country, will be attended with quite contrary effects, and bring di&s;credit on me."</P></Q></P>
<P>From the preceding corre&s;pondence, I think it appears beyond di&s;pute, that the Nabob him|&s;elf has hitherto been a mere cypher through the whole tran&s;action, or rather an in&s;trument, in the hands of Munny Begum and others, employed by them, and for their purpo&s;es only,
<PB N="40" REF="44">
to accompli&s;h the removal of Mahomed Reza Khan: That the&s;e people have made a mo&s;t dan|gerous and iniquitous u&s;e of the Nabob's name and authority, while they had both at their di&s;|po&s;al: And that the Governor General him&s;elf was convinced that the interference of the Na|bob, or of tho&s;e who acted for him in the affairs of the Nizamut, had been attended with the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences, which he accord|ingly endeavoured to obviate, by directing him not to concern him&s;elf in any &s;hape in the con|duct of the bu&s;ine&s;s intru&s;ted to the Naib Subadar.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Nabob, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that his letters involve him in a very di&s;|graceful dilemma. If I could believe it po&s;&s;ible that, freely, and of his own mere motion, he could recommend, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That Munny Begum &s;hould take on her&s;elf the management of the affairs of the Nizamut, without the interference of any other per&s;on;</HI></Q> that he &s;hould in one letter de&s;ire to conduct the affairs of the Nizamut him&s;elf, and in the next, that a Naib &s;hould be appointed to conduct them for him, I &s;hould give little credit to the a&s;&s;ertion with which the&s;e reque&s;ts are accompanied, viz. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that he is not devoid of under&s;tanding.</HI>"</Q> He may arrive at years of maturity; but if, at the age of twenty-one, he does not perceive the folly and ab&s;urdity of &s;uch propo&s;itions, and &s;uch
<PB N="41" REF="45">
contradictions, I &s;hould de&s;pair of his ever arriving at years of di&s;cretion. On the other hand, if the&s;e letters are written for him, which I am thoroughly &s;atisfied is the ca&s;e; if he has no will of his own, and if the rights and autho|rities demanded in his name are in reality to de|volve to Munny Begum, to her chief eunuch, and to the other per&s;ons of who&s;e mi&s;conduct the late Naib Subadar made &s;o many complaints to the Governor, what opinion are we to enter|tain of his Excellency's under&s;tanding and vera|city; or on what ground can we commit the management of &s;uch important affairs to a young man &s;o dependant on Munny Begum, and evi|dently &s;o incapable of judging or acting for him&s;elf?</P>
<P>I now proceed to the la&s;t orders from the Court of Directors: they con&s;ider the whole &s;ubject in the &s;ame light that I do: they ac|knowledge no right of inheritance in the Na|bob: they under&s;tand every o&s;ten&s;ible acce&s;&s;ion to his power as a real one to that of Munny Begum: they deem it for the welfare of the country that the office of Naib Subadar &s;hould be continued; and they po&s;itively direct us forthwith to &s;ignify to the Nabob their plea&s;ure, that Mahomed Reza Khan be immediately re&s;tored to it.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding they had a thorough knowledge of the facts, and were perfectly
<PB N="42" REF="46">
acquainted with all the characters, they cer|tainly were not aware of the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a ca&s;e as now exi&s;ts, or they would have pro|vided again&s;t it. They did not fore&s;ee that their po&s;itive orders would not be inforced by this government, or that &s;uch orders would be di&s;obeyed. When they read the Nabob's late letters, the fal&s;e and frivolous pretences on which he ventures to counteract and defeat an arrange|ment which the Company have deemed nece&s;|&s;ary for the welfare of the country will a&s;toni&s;h them no le&s;s than our acquie&s;cence in &s;uch pre|tences.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"that he had formerly writ|ten to the Governor that he had no farther occa&s;ion for a Naib, and would him&s;elf conduct his own affairs:"</Q> And he a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ince the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Mahomed Reza Khan to the pre&s;ent time, the bu&s;ine&s;s had been con|ducted under his own immediate direction. Is it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould forget, that in con&s;equence of Sudder ul Hoc Khan's appointment, the Go|vernor had expre&s;sly required him not to inter|fere, and that the Nabob had thereupon relin|qui&s;hed all concern with the affairs of the Fouz|darry and Adawlet, and left the entire manage|ment of them in the hands of the Naib. In his next letter he talks of the rights of his de|cea&s;ed father, as well as his own, as if the office of Nazim were hereditary. He talks of his
<PB N="43" REF="47">
claims on the Company, as if he held by &s;ome other title than their friend&s;hip and protection; or, as if either he or his father had any right in the Subadary beyond what they derived from the voluntary acts of the Company, or of their repre&s;entatives. He &s;ays, he never will admit Mahomed Reza Khan to po&s;&s;e&s;s any degree of authority in his family; and that as Sudder ul Hoc Khan is dead, he &s;hall take on him&s;elf the management of the bu&s;ine&s;s. In his la&s;t let|ter he ob&s;erves, that Mahomed Reza Khan was at fir&s;t appointed on account of his, the Nabob's, tender age, which required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Naib; forgetting not only that a Naib Subadar was appointed, and the office executed without objection during the government of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors, but that he him&s;elf had &s;ubmitted, about a year ago, to the appointment of Sudder ul Hoc Khan; and that the latter continued to execute his &s;everal offices till his death, with powers totally and avowedly independent of the Nabob: he forgets, or perhaps he does not know, that the treaty of March, 1770, by which alone his rights, whatever they may be, were created, provides for the appointment of a Naib of the provinces, to be inve&s;ted with the manage|ment of affairs; and that this Naib was ap|pointed at the in&s;tance of the Governor and Gentlemen of the Council. In the &s;ame letter the Nabob declares, that he admini&s;ters the affairs of the Nizamut <HI>by his own authority, and</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="48">
<HI>&s;hall do &s;o;</HI> and that he never can, on any ac|count, agree to the appointment of Mahomed Reza Khan to the Naib Souba&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Governor General's letter of the 10th of October, 1778, will &s;hew the Company not only in what manner this important bu&s;ine&s;s is likely to be conducted, and what opinion the Governor General him&s;elf entertains of the Na|bob's capacity, but that neither were his &s;up|po&s;ed rights and the maturity of his age attended to at that time, nor his per&s;onal incli|nations con&s;ulted. Notwith&s;tanding all his claims to the Phouzdarry and Adawlet, the Go|vernor's plea&s;ure dive&s;ted him of both, and left him without an option. The&s;e, however, are not the fir&s;t and immediate objects of con|&s;ideration. A new and unexpected que&s;tion is now before us. The Company's orders are di&s;|obeyed on pretended principles, which &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of an authority in the&s;e provinces independent of the authority of Great Britain over them. That of the Court of Directors is the only medium by which the &s;ubjection of Bengal to Great Britain is held and &s;ecured. In oppo|&s;ition to it the Nabob declares, that <HI>he acts by his own authority, and &s;hall continue to do &s;o.</HI> I do not know what name the law will give to di&s;|obedience of the Company's lawful orders by this Board; or whether &s;uch di&s;obedience, di|rectly avowed by our&s;elves, would not be le&s;s
<PB N="45" REF="49">
criminal, and in its con&s;equences le&s;s dangerous, than under the form which it now a&s;&s;umes: but every man mu&s;t &s;ee which way the pre&s;ent example leads, and what u&s;e may be made of it. If &s;ome vigorous mea&s;ure be not immediately taken by the Company to di&s;arm the Nabob of all means of re&s;i&s;tance, or at lea&s;t to deter him from attempting it again, their dominion over Bengal is not &s;ecure. I am &s;orry this inexperi|enced young man &s;hould have been &s;o unhappily advi&s;ed. He does not know on what dangerous ground he treads. He forgets him&s;elf too gro&s;sly when he di&s;obeys the Company's po&s;i|tive orders, and in the &s;ame breath tells the Governor General, <Q REND="inline">"You are the ma&s;ter and my patron, and I can take no mea&s;ure without fir&s;t communicating it to you."</Q></P>
<P>The Company will con&s;ider whether this avowed di&s;tinction between them and their local repre&s;entative be not &s;omething more than di&s;|re&s;pectful; or whether their injunctions would have been &s;lighted if they had been accompa|nied by the u&s;ual and proper requi&s;ition on the part of the Governor General and Council, which I repeatedly recommended without &s;uc|ce&s;s. Other and more alarming reflections will naturally &s;ucceed. The o&s;ten&s;ible &s;hadow of the Nabob's authority may in time find a &s;ub&s;tance to &s;upport it. If the &s;pirit of party and faction, which prevails through every de|partment
<PB N="46" REF="50">
of government, and through every other rank of life, &s;hould reach to the Seapoys, it would be a painful, but not a difficult, ta&s;k, to count the few remaining &s;teps which lead inevitably from that &s;tate of things to final di&s;&s;olution. At whatever di&s;tance that danger may appear to be, yet, if the cour&s;e we are in points directly to it, I tru&s;t that the wi&s;dom of the Company will not deem it unworthy of their in&s;tant con&s;ideration. The &s;ame mea&s;ures by which a great and imminent mi&s;chief might have been prevented will not be &s;ufficient to correct or retrieve it.</P>
<P>I now move that it may be re&s;olved, That the preceding letter from the Nabob is highly di&s;&s;ati&s;|factory to the Board; and that the Governor General be reque&s;ted to &s;ignify the &s;ame to him, and to demand in our name his immediate compliance with the orders of the Company.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wheler.</HI> I agree to the motion.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Barwell.</HI> If any advantage was &s;tated to derive to the Company by controuling the will of the Nabob, it might be a que&s;tion with me how far the occa&s;ion would vindicate the com|pul&s;ion propo&s;ed; but when no national bene|fit can accrue, nor is &s;tated, I cannot give my a&s;&s;ent to a very exceptionable mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Governor General.</HI> I &s;hall take another occa|&s;ion to declare my &s;entiments at large on the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="47" REF="51">
of this motion. For the pre&s;ent I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with declaring, that I have gone to the utmo&s;t lengths pre&s;cribed to me by the Com|pany's orders, and by my &s;en&s;e of my duty, and that I will not go beyond them.</P>
<P>The motion re&s;olved in the negative.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> Since it is re&s;olved that the Board will not in&s;i&s;t on the Nabob's compliance with the Company's orders, nothing is left for me but to move, as I now do, that the &s;alary allotted by the Company out of their revenue for the &s;up|port of the office of Naib Souba, amounting to three lack of &s;icca rupees per annum, or &s;o much of it as was divided between Munny Begum, Baboo Begum, Raja Gourda&s;s, and Sudder ul Hoc Cawn may cea&s;e, and be made a &s;aving in the Company's trea&s;ury from the day when Sudder ul Hoc Khan died.</P>
<P>It is the Company's property, and if it be not employed in the manner they direct, it &s;hould not at lea&s;t be applied to any other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Wheler.</HI> I agree to the motion.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Barwell.</HI> I mu&s;t de&s;ire that the fund from which this payment is made to the mini&s;|ters of the Nabob be &s;tated by the Accomptant General before I give my opinion on the motion.</P>

<P>Con&s;idered the motion made by Mr. Francis at the la&s;t con&s;ultation, viz.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That the &s;alary allotted by the Company out of their revenues, for the &s;upport of the office of Naib Soubah, amounting to three lacks of &s;icca rupees per annum, or &s;o much of it as was divided between Munny Begum, Baboo Begum, Raja Gourda&s;s, and Sudder ul Hoc Khan may cea&s;e, and be made a &s;aving in the Company's trea&s;ury from the day when Sudder ul Hoc Khan died."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Barwell.</HI> By the letter received by Mr. Croftes, the charge of the Nizamut allowances appears to be defrayed by the Company. There was, I find, a certain fund, under the name of the Sinking Fund, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the orders of the Company, limiting the per&s;onal charges of the Nabob to the &s;um of &s;ixteen lacks, and re&s;erving &s;icca rupees 15,81,860 per annum; and to this fund was charged certain demands again&s;t the Mogul government, which have &s;ince been totally liquidated, as will appear more par|ticularly by a &s;tate of the fund which I have ju&s;t now received from Mr. Croftes. If it was incumbent on the Nabob to di&s;charge, out of the allowances made to him by our government, the different claims which appear to be &s;tated in this account, I do not &s;ee any rea&s;on why the
<PB N="49" REF="53">
Company &s;hould continue burthened with cer|tain expences, which ari&s;e &s;olely on the &s;core of his government, while tho&s;e means which he has of providing for the whole from his e&s;ta|bli&s;hed allowances remain unapplied. By the pre&s;ent method it appears to me that the &s;avings &s;tated in the Sinking Fund are made totally at the expence of the Company, becau&s;e the charges of the Nizamut, or country government depen|dant on the Soubah, in&s;tead of being di&s;bur&s;ed from the &s;um allotted for the Soubah's govern|ment, are di&s;bur&s;ed from the Company's means, and the claim on the &s;core of the allowances fixed for the charges of the Soubah's govern|ment &s;uffered to accumulate to the exorbitant &s;um of rupees, 90,04,188,7,4, as a debt due from the Company. This being the ca&s;e, there appears to me an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to correct an error, which has led Mr. Francis into the idea that the di&s;bur&s;ements which are made by the Com|pany are made by them out of their revenues, for the &s;upport of the office of Naib Soubah, amounting to three lacks of rupees per annum. While the Company hold this fund of 15,81,860 rupees per annum, of the &s;um of 31,81,860, which by treaty they expre&s;sly &s;tipulate to pay for the &s;upport of the Soubah's government, it is not ju&s;t that they &s;hould be charged with any expence to be di&s;bur&s;ed on that account. I therefore MOVE, <Q REND="inline">"That all expences that have been incurred, or &s;hall in future be incurred,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
on account of the Nizamut, or country go|vernment department, or the Soubah, be &s;et off again&s;t the claims of the Soubah, for &s;uch part of the &s;tipend or &s;alary allotted for the &s;upport of his government as has been re|tained by government for this and other ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;es directed by the Company."</Q>&mdash;I under&s;tand the motion made by Mr. Francis to have for its object the compelling the Nabob to accept of Mahomed Reza Khan for his mini|&s;ter, or to re&s;erve the &s;um which is allotted as the due of Mahomed Reza Khan, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the orders of the Company. This motion being made on the pre&s;umption that the Niza|mut officers are the officers of the Company, and in the pay of the Company, can only be &s;up|ported upon that principle. I am therefore again&s;t the motion.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis's motion carried in the negative.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis.</HI> If I under&s;tand the preceding minute, the &s;avings from which the Sinking Fund therein mentioned was con&s;tituted, viz. 15,81,860 &s;icca rupees per annum (accruing &s;ince the time when the pen&s;ion of the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah, as &s;ettled by a treaty highly di&s;approved of by the Company, was re|duced to 16 lacks by their po&s;itive orders) do not belong to the Company, and that &s;omething will be gained by charging that fund with the amount of the &s;alary allotted by the Company,
<PB N="51" REF="55">
out of their own revenues, for the &s;upport of the Naib Subadar. It is indifferent to me, and I believe perfectly immaterial to the Company, in what way the account is &s;tated. The charge, if di&s;bur&s;ed, comes out of the Company's trea|&s;ury; it is immediately paid out of the collec|tions of the divi&s;ion of Moor&s;hedebad, as the Company will &s;ee by referring to our Letter to Mr. Martin, of the 11th of May, 1778. Am I to under&s;tand that Mr. Barwell means to make the Company debtor to the Nabob Mobareck ul Dowlah for the amount of the above &s;avings? if he does, I wi&s;h it to be declared &s;o in plain terms: they would by this time amount, as I believe, to 112 lacks of &s;icca rupees: If he does not, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover the meaning or application of his motion. As for my&s;elf, I deny the fact, and all con&s;equences pretended to be derived from it. On the remainder of Mr. Barwell's minute there is but little to be &s;aid, &s;uppo&s;ing it true that a <HI>real</HI> effective country go|vernment now exi&s;ted, and that the affairs of the Nizamut did of right fall under the imme|diate admini&s;tration of Mobareck ul Dowlah (all which is &s;o manife&s;tly contrary to the fact, that it will not bear an argument) &s;till it would not follow that my la&s;t motion ought to be rejected. The &s;um which I propo&s;e to be re&s;erved is not divided among the officers of the Nizamut: Mr. Barwell &s;urely did not con&s;ider in what manner it is actually di&s;tributed; neither do I admit that my la&s;t motion had for its object <HI>the compel|ling</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="56">
<HI>the Nabob to accept of Mahomed Reza Khan for his mini&s;ter.</HI> It could not po&s;&s;ibly have that effect; the point was already decided by a pre|ceding re&s;olution; and if, as I conclude, the &s;ole object of the Nabob be to keep the amount of Mahomed Reza Khan's &s;alary, and to di&s;tri|bute it among his family and dependents, our taking the money from him will not tend to compel him to rein&s;tate Mahomed Reza Khan, by which he would equally lo&s;e it. If that were the only alternative propo&s;ed to him, he would certainly prefer the mea&s;ure which freed him from the check of Mahomed Reza Khan's au|thority, and left every thing in his own hands.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid the mode of &s;tating the account propo&s;ed by Mr. Barwell is a matter of indif|ference in it&s;elf; but as it implies a conclu&s;ion in which I do not concur, I am again&s;t the mo|tion.</P>
