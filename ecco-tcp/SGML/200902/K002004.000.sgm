<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Caprices d' Amour ou Ninette a la Cour,</HI> written by Mr. Favart, is the ground work of the following little piece. But I believe whoever &s;hall examine both Operas, will find that I have been perhaps too wanton in my imitation, and departed too widely from the original. They may probably wi&s;h that I had pil|fered more and written le&s;s. What I have added, what I have omitted, or what
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
I have alter'd, tho&s;e who can compare one piece with the other, will ea&s;ily perceive, and to tho&s;e who cannot make the com|pari&s;on, any explanation on that head is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When Mr. Favart's comedy was fir&s;t put into my hands, I could not but be much plea&s;ed with the life and &s;implicity he had thrown into his performance, with|out de&s;cending to that &s;pecies of humour, which the Engli&s;h have very little reli&s;h of, gro&s;s Italian buffoonry. This I have chiefly endeavoured to pre&s;erve in the following Opera, with what &s;ucce&s;s the Public will determine.</P>

<P>Yes <HI>Fabian,</HI> I do ob&s;erve, nay pity her un|ea&s;ine&s;s. The &s;en&s;ibility of the prince&s;s alarms me; I know her virtues, and am convinced of her affection for me.

<P>Your highne&s;s' orders have already done it, for what you promi&s;ed <HI>Phoebe,</HI> will be a proof, which <HI>Emily</HI> cannot &s;u&s;pect, that this amour has nothing real in it.

<P>It is the &s;eat of wonders. Every thing changes character here, the men are quite different.

upon him, here he was bowing and &s;craping and cringing. Why are they &s;o complai&s;ant here, the&s;e great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country?
