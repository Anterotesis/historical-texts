<STAGE><HI>Scene, the Hou&s;e of</HI> Sir JOHN MILLAMOUR.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Sir JOHN, <HI>and</HI> BYGROVE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY then I'd marry again, and di&s;inherit him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Bygrove, you think too &s;everely in the&s;e matters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Severely, Sir John? If I had a mind that my &s;on &s;hould marry, why &s;hould he not do as I would have him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Allowance mu&s;t be made for inclina|tion. The &s;ucce&s;s of our children depends upon the manner, in which we &s;et them out in the world. They are like bowls which, if deliver'd out of hand with a due regard to their bias, our aim is an&s;wer'd, if otherwi&s;e, they are &s;hort or wide of the mark in view, or perhaps ru&s;h wildly out of the green.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYGROVE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well argued, truly! he that &s;hould obey is to judge for him&s;elf, and you that are his go|vernor, are to be directed by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he is chiefly intere&s;ted in the end, and the choice of the means may be fairly left to him|&s;elf. I can't but be tender of George; a plant of my own rearing, and the tree will hereafter be known by its fruit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a tree that will bear nothing without grafting; and if I could not inoculate what will make it thrive and flouri&s;h, it &s;hould not incumber a foot of my land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;y&s;tem and mine differ widely, Brother Bygrove. My &s;on is of a large and liberal under&s;tanding, and I a father of mild authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Authority!&mdash;your &s;on's word is a law to you. Now there is my young gracele&s;s; he is in the army, and why? Becau&s;e I cho&s;e it. I had a mind he &s;hould &s;erve; and &s;o he went to be &s;hot at. No arguing with me. If I &s;ee any thing wrong, I acco&s;t him directly: Look ye, Sir, do you think to go on in this fa&s;hion? Not during my life, I pro|mi&s;e you: I will acknowledge you no longer than you prove worthy; and if you can't di&s;cern what is befitting you, I at lea&s;t will judge what is proper on my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, George and I have lived together as friends. From a boy, I endeavoured to &s;ubject him rather to his rea&s;on, than his fears. If any little irregularity happened, he was no &s;ooner &s;en&s;ible of it, than his cheek coloured, and the blu&s;h of youth not only looked decent, but expre&s;&s;ed an ingenuous and well-di&s;po&s;ed mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the con&s;equence of all this? Has he a &s;ettled opinion? a fixed principle for a moment? He is grown up in caprice; his judgment has not vi|gour to be deci&s;ive upon the mere&s;t trifle; he is de|&s;tracted by little things, and of cour&s;e is peri&s;hing by little and little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no; all from a good cau&s;e; his knowledge of life occa&s;ions quick reflection: quick reflection &s;hews things in a variety of lights. I am not angry. He will &s;ettle in the world; you will &s;ee him married before long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what a variety of lights his wife will ap|pear to him.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="9">
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon for a moment. I &s;ee per&s;on there. Charles, Charles, this way.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CHARLES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Charles, what is he about?</P>

<P>Very bu&s;y, Sir, a thou&s;and things in hand.</P>

<P>And all at the &s;ame time, I'll warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a deal to employ us, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you &s;ounded him in regard to what I mentioned la&s;t night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I wanted to tell your Ho|nour. La&s;t night, Sir, as he was going to bed, I touch'd upon the &s;ubject; dropt a hint or two, that it is now time to think of rai&s;ing heirs to him&s;elf; en|larged upon the comforts of matrimony, and I think with no &s;mall degree of eloquence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fellow is laughing at you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how? What effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very vi&s;ible effect, Sir. This morn|ing early, my ma&s;ter rings his bell. Charles, &s;ays he, I have been con&s;idering what you &s;aid la&s;t night: I &s;hall pay a vi&s;it to the young ladies, and, I believe, I &s;hall marry one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Mr. Bygrove; I am for ever ob|liged to you, Charles. Well, go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fly immediately to get him his things to dre&s;s, and return in an in&s;tant. Charles, &s;ays he, then to&s;&s;ed him&s;elf back in his chair, beat the ground with his heel, and fell a reading. Won't your Honour get ready to vi&s;it the young ladies?&mdash;The ladies? what ladies, you blockhead?&mdash;Lady Bell, and Lady Jane, your Honour, Mrs. Bromley's hand&s;ome nieces. Po! you're a num&s;kull, &s;ays he, with an oblique kind of a &s;mile; &s;tretched his arms, yawned, talked to him&s;elf, and bade me go about my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew it would end &s;o. There is not a crane-neck carriage in town can give a &s;hort turn with
<PB N="4" REF="10">him. He will continue going on from one thing to another, and end in nothing at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is provoking. Any body with him this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has had a power of people with him, Sir&mdash;A commi&s;&s;ion-broker, to &s;ell him a com|pany in a marching regiment; the Mayor of a bo|rough, about a &s;eat in parliament. And there are &s;everal with him now, Sir. There is Sir Harry Love|wit, and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! Sir Harry! I am glad he is of age, and that I am no longer his guardian. He has not had a new idea in his head &s;ince he was five years old, and yet the blockhead affects to be lively. He runs after wits, who do nothing but laugh at him. He repeats &s;craps and &s;entences; all memory and no under&s;tanding; a mere retailer of what falls from other people, and with that &s;tock he &s;ets up for a wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is with my ma&s;ter, Sir; and there is Mr. Malvil, and Mr. Da&s;hwould, and&mdash;<HI>(bell rings)</HI> &mdash;He rings, Sir: you will pardon me; I mu&s;t be gone, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that fellow, Da&s;hwould; he is the ruin of your &s;on, and of poor Sir Harry into the bargain. He is the Merry Andrew of the town: honour has no re&s;traint upon him; truth he &s;ets at nought, and friend&s;hip he is ever ready to &s;acrifice to a joke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Po! mere innocent plea&s;antry. Da&s;h|would has no harm in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>No harm in him? I grant you the fellow has a quick &s;en&s;e of the ridiculous, and draws a charac|ter with a lucky hit. But every thing is di&s;torted by him. He has wit to ridicule you; invention to frame a &s;tory of you; humour to help it about, and when he has &s;et the town a laughing, he puts on a familiar air, and &s;hakes you by the hand.</P>

<SPEAKER>BYG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the ea&s;e of an executioner. He puts all to death without remor&s;e. He laughs at every thing, as if Heaven intended to make its own work ridicu|lous.

<P>Ob&s;erve old Bygrove. He pronounces with rigour upon the conduct of others, and hopes his own follies lie concealed. His whole &s;truggle is to e&s;cape detection, He hoodwinks him&s;elf, and thinks he blinds you. Po&s;itive and dogmatical in his opinions, yet a dupe to the de&s;igns of others; and flattering him&s;elf that a peevi&s;h and cen&s;orious &s;pirit hides every defect, he gives you the full ridi|cule of his character.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Neville is the be&s;t of them. Mrs. Bromley has taken her into her hou&s;e, as a poor re|lation, whom &s;he pities; and her pity is no more than the cruel art of tormenting an unhappy de|pendant upon her genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>You are in the oppo&s;ite extreme: he thinks too much and never decides. You never think at

Take the advice of your friends before you come here to play the antic tricks of love; to kneel, cringe, fawn, flatter, and make your&s;elf ridiculous. Do you know enough of the world to judge for your&s;elf? Can you tell what they are all doing in the gay &s;phere of life? The young are all bred up under the veterans of vice and folly. The &s;ee their mothers with autumnal faces, playing the agreeable, and for|geting that they are no longer young. The men are advanced beyond all former bounds, and the wo|men pre&s;s clo&s;e a&s;ter them. A club for the ladies! intrepidity is now the female charm: to compleat their career, there is nothing left but to build a turf Coterie, at Newmarket, and ride their own matches, over the four mile cour&s;e.</P>

His little follies, his whims, and caprices one does not mind: He may walk in Da&s;hwould's train as long as he plea&s;es; that only makes him ridiculous. But it grieves me to hear that perfidy &s;tains his character, and, as I am told, the wor&s;t of perfidy: the ruin of beauty and innocence is his ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I don't like anonymous letters. In general they aim at mi&s;chief, but this perhaps, is meant as a caution to you: it mu&s;t be a friend that &s;ent it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nor I; I never-charge any body; but upon recollection, the letter in the news-paper is imputed to him. Mrs. Bromley, I know, has no opinion of Sir Harry. His de&s;igns, with regard to you, &s;he does not think honourable. My heart in|tere&s;ts me for you. You know I am all heart. The plan which Mrs. Bromley has propo&s;ed&mdash;Hark!

When Mi&s;s Ne|ville is heartily tormented by Mrs. Bromley, afflic|tion &s;oftens the mind, and I may then decoy her away, and &s;tand upon terms with the family. But Da&s;hwould's wit will fly about. No matter: he is a &s;ad &s;coundrel, and does not mind how he murders reputations. So! here comes Millamour.

<P>But he does not act from his under&s;tand|ing. Fits and &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion govern him.

<P>Jack Invoice! He never was intended for any thing but to be laughed at. Upon the death of a rich uncle in the city, he comes to the we&s;t end of the town, with a plumb in his pocket, and not an idea in his head; marries a fanta&s;tical woman of rank, and with a &s;overeign contempt of all his former ac|quaintance, mixes with lords and people of quality,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DASH.</SPEAKER>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion, Mr. Millamour, that runs headlong without cau&s;e, and will not hearken to rea|&s;on, is a greater pe&s;t of &s;ociety, than all the little with that has been in the world. What does all this mean, Sir? What is it about?</P>

<P>I don't know by what fatality it happens, but that generally comes la&s;t, which ought to be mentioned fir&s;t. I repeated nothing to Sir John: who did? Do you a&s;k that que&s;tion? Malvil, Sir, with his u&s;ual duplicity.</P>

<P>Then this bu&s;ine&s;s may &s;ober you. What was your whi&s;per to me about that gentleman?</P>

<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he treated with wanton plea&s;antry what I thought a &s;erious matter. I may mi&s;take the means, but the end of my actions I can always an|&s;wer for. Sir John might hear of the affair from another quarter, and &s;o to &s;often his re&s;entment&mdash;</P>

<P>I did not addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MIL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you have the grimace of character. Mr. Malvil, arm'd at all points with plau&s;ible maxims. But which of your maxims can ju&s;tify the treachery of betraying the &s;ecret of a friend? Who does it, is a de&s;toryer of all confidence; and when he attempts to varni&s;h his conduct, with the &s;pecious name of friend&s;hip, the malignity &s;trikes the deeper: artful, &s;miling malignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;erve all this. Friend&s;hip in exce&s;s is a fault. There are bounds and limits even to virtue. It would be well if a man could always hit the exact point. There is however &s;omething voluptuous in meaning well.</P>
