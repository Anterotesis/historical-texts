<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO MRS. MONTAGUE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I can boa&s;t no acquaintance with Mrs. MONTAGUE, but that intellectual one, which the world of ta&s;te in general claims with her; I tru&s;t &s;he will pardon the liberty of prefixing her name to a comedy, the writer of which feels an admiration equal to her own for Shake&s;peare. When re&s;earch and critici&s;m &s;eemed exhau&s;ted in throwing lights on the works of this great fountain of Engli&s;h dramatic genius, you, Madam, as if a &s;pirit more congenial to his own, ap|proach &s;till nearer to the Immortal Poet, di&s;pel the la&s;t mi&s;t which time had &s;hed

The &s;mall tribute of re&s;pect I have pre&s;umed to pay your talents in the cour&s;e of my comedy, Madam, was, believe me, the &s;pontaneous incen&s;e of my heart; and I have the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that no reader will &s;u&s;pect me of flattery in this declaration, but one who is a &s;tranger to your &s;ame, and to your virtues.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very great &s;ucce&s;s which has at|tended the performance of the following Comedy, induces the author to &s;tate a cir|cum&s;tance which, on the fir&s;t blu&s;h of the bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t appear rather &s;ingular. <HI>He would be a Soldier</HI> was pre&s;ented to Mr. Col|man in the cour&s;e of la&s;t Summer, and re|turned&mdash;becau&s;e <HI>that gentleman did not like a line of it;</HI> and left this comfortable intelli|gence were not &s;ufficient to wound the feel|ings of the writer, Mr. Colman added, he did not know <HI>what could be done with it, or in what &s;hape it could be produced, &s;o as to contri|bute to the entertainment of the public.</HI></P>
<P>The Author declares, that he then enter|tained &s;uch notions of Mr. Colman's <HI>judge|ment, ta&s;te,</HI> and high <HI>&s;en&s;e of honour,</HI> that his opinion was final with him; he laid by his performance in de&s;pair of ever acquiring pro|fit or &s;ame by it:&mdash;fortunately an intimate friend one day advi&s;ed him to &s;how the piece to Mr. Harris; imagining even <HI>Mr. Colman might be mi&s;taken,</HI> or influenced by <HI>motives, the</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
<HI>writer of this addre&s;s</HI> never-&s;u&s;pected any man harboured, till bitter experience convinced him of the contrary. Mr. Harris, to the very great &s;urpri&s;e, and, no doubt, very <HI>great plea&s;ure</HI> of the author, happened to be totally of a different way of thinking from Mr. Col|man; and what is more, he heard the latter gentleman's opinion of the Comedy, but <HI>had too &s;trong, and too good a mind to be bia&s;&s;ed by it.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s which has attended the piece makes all farther comment on this &s;hort hi&s;tory of it unnece&s;&s;ary; and with the live|lie&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude for the marked atten|tion, kindne&s;s, and liberality of Mr. Harris, the author &s;ubmits his production to the pe|ru&s;al of the world.</P>

<L>PROLOGUES were fir&s;t plain, &s;imple bills of fare;</L>
<L>You ju&s;t were told your entertainment there.</L>
<L>Without, parade, or aim at brilliant hit,</L>
<L>Genius was thrifty then, as rich in wit.</L>
<L>Our modern bards a diff'rent plan pur&s;ue,</L>

<L>With point and je&s;t the prologue &s;till mu&s;t play.</L>
<L>And &s;trike each in&s;ect folly of the day.</L>
<L>But folly now un&s;tricken, wild may fly,</L>
<L>For the mu&s;e wa&s;ts a fav'rite to the &s;ky:</L>
<L>Can little objects charm or fill the mind,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I was not, Sir: but I have often heard of Col. Talbot; he's an Oxford&s;hire gen|tleman; his family, I hear, was the makings of Wilkins. Lord! he has been a long time in the Indies, and, I'm told, has made a power of mo|ney. But is he come home, Sir?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is; and &s;ince, his return has been down in Oxford&s;hire, in &s;earch of Wilkins, where he thought he &s;till lived; and would have come here him&s;elf now, only he's very much indi&s;|po&s;ed.</P>

<P>Ble&s;s your heart! Jacob Wilkins has been in town, and kept the George inn the&s;e ten years.</P>

<SPEAKER>John&s;.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has made a very ungrateful return to his benefactor, Col. Talbot. My ma&s;ter thought him dead, not having heard from him &s;o many years: a conduct that was unpardonable, con&s;i|dering his obligations to the Colonel, and the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>

<P>You a&s;toni&s;h me! But how came &s;o great a man's &s;on to be left in your care?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you mu&s;t know that Colonel Tal|bot, previous to his going abroad, was privately married to a beautiful girl who waited on his mo|ther: he had a &s;on by this girl; and as the child came into the world ju&s;t as he was obliged to em|bark with the army for Portugal, the war before la&s;t, he left him in my care, de&s;iring me to let him pa&s;s for my own till his return; and in ca&s;e he was kill'd, to continue the deception till the death of his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has the Colonel never been in England &s;ince?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what manner did you lo&s;e him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be certain: but, as he was a boy of great &s;pirit, and ever prattling of being a &s;ol|dier, I &s;u&s;pect he was inveigled off by a recruiting
<PB N="6" REF="13">
party, which at that time was beating up for men in the village.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't you acquaint his mother im|mediately with what had happen'd?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrote to the Colonel, to be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There I was to blame. I cou'dn't &s;um|mon up re&s;olution &s;ufficient. I thought he wou'd have attributed the child's leaving me, to neglect, or cruel treatment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The be&s;t advice I can give you is, to tell Colonel Talbot his &s;on is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how &s;hall I produce a certificate of that? Should he examine the pari&s;h regi&s;ter, and no record of &s;uch a child's death be found, I &s;hou'd be taken up, and tried on a &s;u&s;picion of murder.</P>
</SP>

<P>Then tell him the truth at once.</P>

it gives me the greate&s;t hopes of his reformation. The &s;ociety of an accompli&s;h'd and beautiful wo|man &s;oftens and refines the roughe&s;t nature; &s;he imparts, by a &s;ecret magic, her elegances and her graces; and to conver&s;e with her, is a kind of &s;tudy that in&s;en&s;ibly poli&s;hes her admirer.&mdash;But what rea&s;on have you to &s;uppo&s;e he is inclin'd to gallantry?</P>

<P>He has imparted all his amours to me; but one in particular, which very much diverted me, indeed:&mdash;After having been &s;ucce&s;sful with bar maids, young milleners, and taylors' daugh|ters, out of number, Cupid &s;hot him from a chee&s;e-cake battery, and he fell in love with a pa&s;trycook's daughter; which, oh, terrible! was the cau&s;e of his having an affair of honor with an attorney's clerk, in which both parties were bound over: but in painting this Helen, who bred the contention, how &s;hall I do him ju&s;tice at &s;econd hand?

His father, old Cre|velt, was no more than a &s;erjeant, and &s;erv'd in Germany under Lord Granby; he brought this young man with him to India, whil&s;t yet a boy; the fir&s;t day he ever was in action, he &s;aw his father fall; and he was found after the battle among&s;t the &s;lain, clo&s;e to his body, apparently lifele&s;s with lo&s;s of blood, as if he had died in the pious office of defending a parent.</P>

<P>I &s;o much admire it, Madam, that I would give the world this moment for the pencil of its immortal writer, to paint one of our &s;ex in the &s;ame &s;tate of uncomplaining de&s;pondency.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that &s;trange, Sir, when I come with Shake&s;peare in my hand; a ma&s;ter who teaches the whole hi&s;tory of the pa&s;&s;ions? His keen and ardent eye in a fine frenzy rolling, pierced into the &s;ecret chambers of the heart where the pa&s;&s;ions &s;lumber; and woke them, as he &s;wept his lyre divine to all their changeful moods of pain and joy, till kindled up to madne&s;s, or to ec&s;ta&s;y; but, when he touches upon love, though the fla&s;h be momentary, it re&s;embles lightning, &s;uddenly rift|ing the &s;urface of the earth, and di&s;clo&s;ing the ra|diant portal of a diamond quarry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I to wi&s;h another laurel on the grave of Shake&s;peare, it &s;hould be planted by the hand of &s;o charming a commentator.</P>

<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, there is a laurel already planted on his grave by one of our &s;ex, which will flouri&s;h till the &s;pirit of his genius, and his writings are no more remembered&mdash;but to the point&mdash;I have pronoune'd you in love; now let me know who your mi&s;tre&s;s is?</P>

<P>Madam, I dare not.</P>

<P>Dare not! Is that a &s;oldier's phra&s;e? Courage, man; there is nothing impo&s;&s;ible to &s;pirit and per&s;everance: be&s;ides, the more diffi|culties lay in the road to your mi&s;tre&s;s, the better &s;he'll like you for &s;urmounting them.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even pre&s;uming that were the ca&s;e, which I have by no means rea&s;on to imagine, I cannot think of her without condemning my&s;elf.</P>

<P><STAGE>(A&s;ide.)</STAGE> Then I'm undone; &s;he loves the man for whom &s;he is intended; and the a&s;&s;ur|ance of that I have now received from her own lips, was meant as a reproach to a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he has di&s;covered, in &s;pite of all my efforts to conceal it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Crev.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain from the &s;arca&s;m of that reply, that &s;he under&s;tands me&mdash;but I am ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for my apo&s;tacy to honour, in daring to think of her.</P>

<P>Confound tho&s;e mono&s;yllables! Char|lotte, let me have no more of them; the laconic &s;tyle does not become you: I wonder from whom you take it; for my part I'm fond of the figure of amplification in di&s;cour&s;e; and I'm &s;ure your mother deals in an eloquence copious at times, even to redundancy.</P>

<P>Sir, I have not &s;pirits for conver&s;ation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed at that, when you have every thing your own way: you won't marry this body, nor you won't marry t'other; and I, like

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir O.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if I do change my mind often, isn't it for your good? As one project &s;tarts up in my mind better than another, in order to take ad|vantage of that, I mu&s;t naturally contradict my&s;elf. The Spani&s;h proverb &s;ays, a wi&s;e man often changes his mind, a fool never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>According to that proverb you &s;hould be a &s;econd Solomon: who you intend for me next I cannot po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s; but as I never will marry without your con&s;ent, I tru&s;t it will not be deem|ed undutiful, if I always retain a negative to my|&s;elf, in a matter which &s;o nearly concerns my hap|pine&s;s as the choice of a hu&s;band.</P>

<L>NOW critic Jove the &s;cale aloft &s;u&s;pends;</L>
<L>On who&s;e dread beam the poet's fate depends:</L>
<L>Ye gods above, high arbiters of wit,</L>
<L>Who on your &s;hilling thrones in council &s;it;</L>
<L>You I implore, for our poor bard afraid,</L>
<L>To grant cele&s;tial, upper-gall'ry aid;</L>
<L>If you approve, with Cato I &s;hall cry</L>
<L>The gods take care of poets in the &s;ky!</L>
<L>As for the ladies&mdash;they'll &s;ure hear my pray'r,</L>
<L>New charms good-nature lends the faire&s;t fair;</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, I hardly think they can be foes,</L>
<L>To a fond maid who a brave &s;oldier cho&s;e.</L>
<L>Who like a &s;oldier charms the fair one's eyes,</L>
<L>The queen of beauty was a &s;oldier's prize?</L>
<L>In love as war, the brave man be&s;t &s;ucceeds,</L>
<L>Our &s;ex reveres that valour which it needs.</L>
<L>Ye beaux, &s;o finely wai&s;ted now-a-days,</L>
<L>That one wou'd almo&s;t &s;wear you put on &s;tays;</L>
<L>You, I confe&s;s, create no great alarm,</L>
<L>You hav'nt &s;pirit to do good, or harm.</L>
<L>But yonder I e&s;py &s;ome dangerous faces;</L>
<L>Good critics, I entreat your favouring graces:</L>
<L>All I reque&s;t is, when a fault's &s;et down,</L>
<L>Its neighbouring beauty may be told the town;</L>
<L>But after this, if you attempt to growl,</L>
<L>I'll excommunicate you, every &s;oul!</L>
<L>In my lawn &s;leeves and &s;hirt, I'll come &s;o big,</L>
<L>In every thing a bi&s;hop, but his wig:</L>
<L>Nay, if you doubt, an army I will bring</L>
<L>Of bi&s;hops, who may crown the greate&s;t king:</L>
<L>Their &s;leeves of lawn, the down-wings of the dove;</L>
<L>Their &s;a&s;h, the ce&s;tus of the queen of love:</L>
<L>With aid like this, and aid you'll own divine,</L>
<L>Who wou'd not think &s;ucce&s;s were &s;urely mine?</L>
<L>In anxious hope I wait the dread decree,</L>
<L>That mu&s;t be final both to bard and me.</L>
