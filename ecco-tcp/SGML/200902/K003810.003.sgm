<P>O RAYMOND, Raymond! my olde&s;t friend, my true&s;t com|panion, pity, ah pity the angui&s;h of a father&mdash;pity a parent who&s;e per&s;ecu|tions have driven away his child! Emma hath eloped. Heaven knows where &s;he has wandered. Under pretence of vi&s;iting a friend near town, &s;he went in one of the public &s;tages, with intent, as &s;he &s;aid, to re|turn in the evening. The friend whom &s;he <HI>pretended</HI> to vi&s;it was Mrs. Arnold of Richmond, on whom &s;he had often called in a neigh|bourly way. I remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight. A

tempe&s;t of thunder and lightening happening about nine o'clock, I &s;ent over a &s;ervant to Mrs. Arnold's, ima|gining &s;he might be afraid to come through it alone. The &s;ervant re|turned from Mrs. Arnold with news that Emma called there for a few mi|nutes by way of morning ride, but went away in a great hurry. It was near midnight before I received the&s;e horrid tidings, and then I ordered my hor&s;es to be harne&s;&s;ed, and went at full &s;peed to every hou&s;e where the &s;tages &s;et up.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CLAIM the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a man whom I know to be generous, who honours me with his e&s;teem, and whom I venerate for the anci|ent friend&s;hip that has long uni|ted our families. By the powerful force of <HI>all</HI> the&s;e feelings I conjure you, on the receipt of this letter, to vi&s;it my father. A&s;&s;ure him that his dear, dear image lives unimpaired in my heart. Tell him that my ab&s;ent|ing my&s;elf in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent, but proceeds
<PB N="21" REF="19">
from a motive mo&s;t virtuous, mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table, mo&s;t con&s;cientious&mdash;from a duty that appeals to my heart, my &s;en&s;es, and my &s;oul. O let him not think that I <HI>glory</HI> in the nece&s;&s;ity which takes me one moment from <HI>him.</HI> I lament, I weep, I mourn over it. I could wi&s;h that each duty went hand in hand, and that &s;ome of their objects did not lie &s;o wide apart from others. Superior to every deceit, I would have con&s;ul|ted my father even on the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, but he will recollect the terror into which his late conver&s;ations threw me, and will then be convinced how impo&s;&s;ible it was to ri&s;que &s;uch an ecclairci&s;&s;ment. Yet even now I will forbear to ju&s;tify my departure,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
becau&s;e I would &s;uffer &s;ome reproach my&s;elf, rather than try to e&s;tabli&s;h an irregular example. But the power who is giving me &s;trength to &s;u&s;tain the great bu&s;ine&s;s I am about to un|dertake, has placed in my bo&s;om &s;omething which reconciles me to the enterprize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be performed&mdash;at lea&s;t attempted. Nature, rea&s;on, ho|nour, and faith the mo&s;t hallowed, all &s;tir within me; nay, God him&s;elf, at the marking of who&s;e awful name, I bow, &s;eems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approba|tion. I may &s;eem to be romantic, when I mean only to &s;hew my&s;elf &s;incere. All &s;ort of re&s;earch will be vain. I would not have yielded to
<PB N="23" REF="21">
the lea&s;t &s;emblance of a &s;cheme, which is mo&s;t terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain &s;entiments, and do me ju&s;tice in his own dear bo&s;om on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever de&s;ired to be uniform, and to reconcile the di&s;tinct parts of my conduct with the whole. Yet I will bear up again&s;t the charge of impropriety in this one in&s;tance for the &s;ake of &mdash;but further explanation is unnece&s;|&s;ary. Go then, oh amiable medi|ator betwixt parent and child&mdash;go, and plead my cau&s;e in all the elo|quence of friend&s;hip. Obtain for me
<PB N="24" REF="22">
the paternal pardon&mdash;&s;u&s;tain his heart, and do not leave him a prey to &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e my forbearing to give you my addre&s;s. Pity the concealments which are thus impo&s;ed. Be it &s;uffi|cient that I will continue to &s;end you accounts of my&s;elf at every oppor|tunity.</P>

<P>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful inclo&s;ure came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are &s;treaming in penitence for the phrenzy which has bani&s;hed my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treated the mo&s;t dutiful of children with unwonted har&s;hne&s;s, and in the patriot I extingui&s;hed the parent. I expected that a &s;oul like Emma's &s;hould circum&s;cribe it&s;elf within the pale of politics. Cur&s;e on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyranies of war! Ah what are cau&s;es, countries,

worlds, to the lo&s;s of one dear child adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett! Blind, doating zeal! what ha&s;t thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the &s;acred &s;ea&s;on of the &s;ilver hair? Is mine an age to engage in the&s;e tumultuous &s;ubjects? No. I &s;hould have taken my darling daughter to my bo&s;om, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fer|vently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <HI>That</HI> would have been true patrioti&s;m and true philan|thropy. In&s;tead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed giddine&s;s in the affray. I in|tere&s;ted my&s;elf in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence; and, while I

talked of ju&s;tice, I was encouraging &s;laughter; wholly forgetting, or too blood-thir&s;ty to remember, that either army is compo&s;ed of kindred and of countrymen. Behold Raymond, how I am puni&s;hed! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No addre&s;s!

<HEAD>SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR ROBERT RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>CORBETT, the &s;eal of Providence is &s;urely upon my enterprize! Oh happy chance! I have at once &s;aved and re&s;cued your daughter. It plea&s;ed God to carry me into the &s;ame place of confinement, where I found her mingled with the multitude of our unhappy countrymen. A violent &s;hriek upon my entrance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes &s;o familiar with her voice and her features. She fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners were too much in|volved in the &s;ullen gloom of their
<PB N="67" REF="65">
own melancholy to regard the di&s;tre&s;s of another. The paper which I in|clo&s;e, &s;potted, as you &s;ee, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her bo&s;om. By the time &s;he recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.&mdash;She looked at him a moment (it being the fir&s;t time &s;he had &s;een him &s;ince he came in) and then &s;unk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh merciful Heaven!&mdash;Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is&mdash;it is&mdash;it mu&s;t be Emma&mdash;it mu&s;t be my SISTER!</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="66">Pre&s;ently, Emma and Edward Cor|bett (for it was your &s;on my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</P>
<P>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the pri&s;on. I was permitted to attend. Edward Cor|bett in his own arms conveyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of ab&s;ence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nur&s;e of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, <HI>I</HI> was not idle.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hington happened to be quar|tered at the &s;ame town, preparing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is ea&s;y of acce&s;s; and being at liberty on
<PB N="69" REF="67">
a parole of honour I gained an inter|view.</P>
<P>Ah, can you not gue&s;s its motive? what <HI>could</HI> it be but the <HI>freedom</HI> of the captive Emma? The General heard the &s;tory of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own for|mer folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The &s;oldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</P>
<P>Sacred, &s;aid he, be the rights of ho&s;pitality: I am not at war with the <HI>affections.</HI> Ever priviledged be <HI>their</HI> emotions. I feel them all. The
<PB N="70" REF="68">
beauteous pri&s;oner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where &s;he plea&s;es.

<P>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time ac|quainted him with her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your &s;on was pronuncing or rather <HI>attempting</HI> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Loui&s;a and his little Edward. And have I then the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, (cried he) and is

my father <HI>yet</HI> in ignorance what claims, what doubly-tender claims, Loui&s;a Corbett hath upon him? He then pre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter in his arms, and they wept together.</P>
<P>Surprizes came too fa&s;t upon the haple&s;s youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for awhile the fiercene&s;s of the &s;oldier, and acted as a man&mdash;as the child of nature&mdash;as the hu&s;band of Loui&s;a, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, your ca|reer is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I ri&s;e above all the prejudices of party. Alas, my &s;i&s;ter, I know too well the

<P>Oh &s;acred force of &s;overeign ten|derne&s;s! Emma has tidings of her Henry. Our enquiries have at length terminated in &s;ucce&s;s. He is now with his regiment off John's-Town. Thither we are bending our cour&s;e with the utmo&s;t expedition. I &s;end you not the minutiae of intervening adventures. They yield to enterprizes of greater moment. We are within one days journey of the place.</P>
<P>By heavens Corbett, the ro&s;es are &s;uddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and &s;icke&s;s and lo&s;s of blood, (which has not been incon&s;iderable) all give way
<PB N="80" REF="78">
to the joyful expectation of &s;eeing her Henry.</P>
<P>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappointments to amiable account. To conquer affec|tion is not, I feel, always po&s;&s;ible; but to direct it from one worthy path into another, when the former is unfit or unju&s;t, is a&s;&s;uredly in our power. Henry him&s;elf cannot adore Emma more &s;incerely than my&s;elf. My whole heart is hers; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of e&s;teem or the object of aver&s;ion is before me. Oh I would not forfeit the partial &s;entiment which my conduct has lodged in the brea&s;t of Emma, for any other earthly enjoy|ment.
<PB N="81" REF="79">
She owns me for her friend, her <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of friends. She talks to me without re&s;erve.&mdash;She looks at me &s;ometimes till the heart's &s;oft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran|deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it &s;tream over my &s;en&s;es. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;ympathy! Pure ef|fu&s;ion! Generous, glorious Emma!</P>
<P>I am penciling the&s;e informations of our route, &s;ometimes in the vehicle and &s;ometimes in a room.</P>
<P>Emma has this moment de&s;ired the driver to &s;top. The door of the chai&s;e is open; &s;he jumps out, &s;ay|ing

<P>In pa&s;&s;ing along, &s;he took note of &s;ome bu&s;hes which were covered thickly with a dun-coloured berry that clu&s;tered in the hedge-rows. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in gathering the&s;e without daring to a&s;k for information as to cau&s;es. She hath an air of intreaty which cuts &s;hort all curio&s;ity about motive, and leaves us no other &s;oli|citude
<PB N="83" REF="81">
than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience.</P>
<P>I knew not the de&s;ign of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <HI>then</HI> &s;he explained to me their u&s;e.</P>
<P>Now for an <HI>experiment,</HI> dear Sir Robert, &s;aid &s;he, taking up the bun|dle, and going into her chamber at a publick-hou&s;e where we baited at twilight.</P>
<P>In about an hour &s;he re-entered&mdash;&s;he <HI>re-entered,</HI> Corbett; but oh how different from that Emma who had &s;o recently retired! You know the clear and lucid white that mixes with the

eloquent bloom in her countenance&mdash;you know that rich tint of tenderne&s;s and ardour, of pathetic &s;oftne&s;s and graceful pa&s;&s;ion, which forms her com|plexion. Imagine my a&s;toni&s;hment at beholding the&s;e di&s;coloured in the darke&s;t &s;hade of that peculiar di&s;gui&s;e which the juice of the berries we had collected ca&s;t over the &s;kin. The &s;tain was deep, &s;trong, and apparently fixed. It re&s;embled almo&s;t exactly the hue of &s;ome of the &s;avages whom we had ob&s;erved to be wounded in a town through which we pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

A party of the Engli&s;h were burning

a village after a &s;udden attack. Ed|ward drew his unavailing &s;word to defend him&s;elf and the inhabitants, who were flying different ways in ter|ror and de&s;pair.&mdash;And there my friend it was your &s;on received his wound&mdash;his wound of death.</P>
<P>The conquerors drove off the cat|tle, loaded them&s;elves with the &s;poils of conque&s;t, then &s;uffered the pea|&s;ants to e&s;cape, and returned to the troops from whence they had been detached.</P>
<P>Edward bled fa&s;t; but having tra|ced our route, he gave directions to the two &s;oldiers who accompanied him and pre&s;&s;ed onward. He was re&s;olved
<PB N="89" REF="87">
once more, he &s;aid, to behold his &s;i&s;|ter. The men, who were indeed of tho&s;e under his command, obeyed his orders; &s;upported him on each &s;ide as he &s;at in the chai&s;e, till, poor young man!&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;You know the re&s;t. He &s;unk upon one of their &s;houlders, and with his dying breath in&s;i&s;ted on their taking his corp&s;e to Emma, of whom he had received tydings by the guide who had la&s;t left us, and whom he met on his return.</P>
<P>The poor fellows came on di&s;con|&s;olate with their dead ma&s;ter. They reached the town where we &s;topped, and were pa&s;&s;ing the window of our

<P>The po&s;tilion got from his hor&s;e; the two &s;oldiers (who had taken the precaution to alter their dre&s;s as Ame|ricans) leaped from the carriage, and joined the multitude that thronged the &s;treets.</P>
<P>The body of Edward was deferred. Emma, (who had then ju&s;t fini&s;hed her remarks on her di&s;gui&s;e) &s;eeing a man lie motionle&s;s, approached the chai&s;e door, and there &s;he beheld&mdash;</P>

No language can de&s;cribe her agonies, but they were attended to by none but my&s;elf: for the whole town was in con&s;ternation at the news of the engagement. Every hou&s;e was emp|tied. The two armies had marched all night, and di&s;tributed their forces. We heard of the large&s;t parties being engaged off John's-Town, and in that place was quartered the regiment of Henry. What was to be done? Ed|ward lay dead before us. Emma was folding his clay-cold body in her arms. She &s;eemed to be lo&s;t in a &s;tupor of irremediable grief. She forgot for awhile her Henry.

Old men were moving their decrepid limbs from door to door in de&s;pair of e&s;cape, and mothers with their children went wailing by us.</P>
<P>With pious ha&s;te, the&s;e hands, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by my heart, (which is devoted to every connexion of Emma) prepa|red an ha&s;ty grave for the reliques of your &s;on.&mdash;Emma touched at the ce|remony bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and exerting her&s;elf beyond what is re|ported

<P>The <HI>hand-writing</HI> of the per&s;on now dictating, would too much di&s;compo&s;e you. He makes u&s;e, therefore, of an amanuen&s;is to prepare the way to cir+cum&s;tances of uncommon joy; and to give them to you in the &s;ecurity of more progre&s;&s;ive explanation.</P>

<P>From the point of death your Emma has recovered. The interpo|&s;ing hand of heaven was <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> ex|tended.</P>
<P>Ten days after the departure of Sir Robert's pacquet, &s;he was in a &s;itua|tion to leave her bed. To what <HI>pur|po&s;e</HI> did &s;he leave it? Re&s;olution, oh how &s;acred is thy force when anima|ted by the breath of love!</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107">If Henry be dead, &s;aid &s;he, it is &s;till the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which &s;he has paid to Edward.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted on &s;earching for the corp&s;e of the man who had cau&s;ed all her misfortunes.</P>
<P>The generous Sir Robert Ray|mond was at that time him&s;elf confi|ned by &s;ickne&s;s which threatened his life: when he was out of danger, Emma gave him in tendere&s;t charge, and &s;et out, alone, towards tho&s;e woods where &s;ome late &s;kirmi&s;hes had pa&s;&s;ed. On her way &s;he had the precaution to u&s;e again tho&s;e berries which tinge the &s;kin: to the&s;e &s;he
<PB N="110" REF="108">
added a certain bark that had been mentioned to her in the cour&s;e of her various enquiries.</P>
<P>Behold, oh Mr. Corbett, behold the dear and delicate Emma, wandering, unprotected, in the woods of Ameri|ca.&mdash;Behold her bearing over her tender &s;houlder the mere nece&s;&s;aries of decent covering.&mdash;Behold the mo&s;t gentle, and mo&s;t female form expo|&s;ed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country&mdash;picking her food from the hedges&mdash;&s;traying &s;he knew not whither&mdash;in di&s;gui&s;e&mdash;in di&s;order &mdash;in de&s;pair!</P>
<P>Incredible were the toils of her re|&s;earch&mdash;incredible her fatigue. The
<PB N="111" REF="109">
fore&s;ts are here, you know, of great extent: the wilds imme&s;urable.</P>
<P>After &s;everal days travelling, du|ring which time &s;he had not encoun|tered any pa&s;&s;enger who could give her the lea&s;t intelligence, &s;he &s;at her|&s;elf down as u&s;ual, about the noon, and wept over her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Scarce had &s;he re&s;ted a moment, ere the clamour of human voices, &s;houting at a &s;mall di&s;tance, caught her attention. She pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily forward through the foliage, and ob|&s;erved, at a little aperture in the fore&s;t, a party of &s;oldiers engaging with a tribe of Indians; but while &s;he was eagerly examining the per&s;ons of the
<PB N="112" REF="110">
<HI>former,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> were put to flight, and retreated with the utmo&s;t prerci|pitation: the &s;oldiers pur&s;ued, and both were out of &s;ight ere Emma had time to approach nearer to them.</P>
<P>She &s;aw enough, however, to con|vince her that the regimentals were Briti&s;h, and the uniform of the off|icers &s;uch as belonged to the regiment of Henry, you will gue&s;s her de&s;pair when &s;he did not perceive Henry among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The bodies of &s;everal Engli&s;h &s;ol|diers were &s;een in different parts of the fore&s;t, but the corp&s;e of Ham|mond could, by no diligence, be found.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="111">Still indefatigable, &s;he went on, though by this time reduced almo&s;t to the la&s;t exigencies of nature, and every thing &s;ubdued but tender re&s;o|lution, and the love which in&s;pired it.</P>
<P>At length, Providence relented to her wi&s;hes, and directed her &s;teps to a broad common path-way, acro&s;s which was extended a human figure, lying as dead, with an arrow &s;ticking in his bo&s;om. You already perceive that it was no other than <HI>Henry him|&s;elf.</HI> This, you <HI>may</HI> perceive, but no tongue can give you the fainte&s;t idea of that unparalleled heroi&s;m and fide|lity, which now in&s;pired the &s;oul of Emma! She found the body yet warm, the pul&s;e &s;lowly moving, and
<PB N="114" REF="112">
the heart languidly beating with life. She extracted the arrow, and &s;ucked the wound&mdash;&s;he had heard of the In|dians u&s;ing &s;hafts who&s;e points were envenomed: and rightly concluding <HI>this</HI> to be one of them, applied to it her lovely lips without he&s;itation.&mdash;This addi|tional danger, was an addi|tional motive to the deed. Oh Mr. Corbett, whatan angel is Emma!</P>
<P>Signs of exi&s;tence increa&s;ed. With &s;carce a covering from the &s;ky, the af|fectionate Emma &s;heltered her unfor|tunate charge for many days. Ere his &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he thickened her di&s;gui&s;e by all the arts in her power. Oh can any thing le&s;s eloquent than the great Author of Nature de&s;cribe
<PB N="115" REF="113">
to you the tran&s;port of this wondrous creature when &s;he fir&s;t beheld the long-clo&s;ed eye of Henry open on the light &mdash;and open on her&s;elf?</P>
<P>Think Mr. Corbett, how difficult <HI>concealment</HI> mu&s;t have been at this extatic moment; then, con&s;ider what pre&s;ence of mind was nece&s;&s;ary, to repre&s;s the dear and dangerous effu|&s;ion. The &s;ilver tones of the &s;ofte&s;t voice in the world were &s;o artfully changed, as to corre&s;pond with the re&s;t of her appearance. She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunting among&s;t the fruits of the fo|re&s;t afforded. He could not move. No &s;oldiers returned. Men drop in a &s;kirmi&s;h, and are &s;ought for no more.
<PB N="116" REF="114">
No hou&s;e was near: no hut: and &s;he dared not &s;tray too far from the place where he lay, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;pot. But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate. Fruits and vegetables, collected by chance, as they grew obvious, and within the beat of Emma's journeyings, were too un&s;ub&s;tantial. It &s;eemed as if famine would compleat what poi&s;on had be|gun. For lack of proper nutriment after fatigues &s;o imminent, he was re|duced to an extreme of languor even wor&s;e than that of Emma; whom ten|derne&s;s &s;eemed to have rendered &s;upe|rior to every thing that could befall her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="115">In the&s;e moments it was that Henry yielded to de&s;pair&mdash;in the&s;e moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector&mdash;</P>

<P>A team now pa&s;t within &s;ight of this di&s;con&s;olate pair. They were laden with provi&s;ions and apparel drawn in &s;ledges, and &s;mall waggons, and were on their way to three detachments of &s;oldiers, (who had applied to the Ge|neral for the&s;e accommodations) that were &s;tationed on the north &s;ide of the fore&s;t. Among&s;t this groupe were al&s;o &s;ome cattle, of which &s;ome were

It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay what u&s;e the unwearied Emma made of the&s;e: her winning addre&s;s, and the moving &s;implicity of her grief, joined to the wretched &s;ituation of an En|gli&s;h officer who appeared to be almo&s;t at the point of death, gained &s;o en|tirely upon the &s;oldiers and people who attended the &s;ledges and wag|gons, that they admin&s;tered whatever could promote the wi&s;h of Emma, and even furni&s;hed her with a &s;ledge, a mule, and a guide, to carry Captain Hammond to John's-Town.</P>
<P>Thus providentially &s;aved from death a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time, I &s;hall not trouble you with other difficulties in the pa&s;|&s;age, or in the progre&s;s of Henry's re|covery,

<P>To her a&s;&s;iduous cares were now &s;uperadded tho&s;e of this excellent man, and Henry became in a &s;hort time the nur&s;eling of both. He could walk, conver&s;e, and his wound was healing.

The human heart loves as it li&s;teth&mdash;it &s;ees its bias, and trembles towards it: but &s;ociety, religion, and the laws, are all to be re&s;pected, and he who pre&s;umes to overleap the&s;e, renders him&s;elf contemptible.

<HEAD>TO C. CORBETT, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE brought my pul&s;es to be almo&s;t as obedient as I wi&s;h them. Rea&s;on is not &s;o weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps, mi&s;under&s;tood, my friend. It is not tyranny, but a mild and <HI>genial</HI> authority, which &s;he &s;hould exerci&s;e. The &s;ubjects of her &s;way are the pa&s;|&s;ions; tho&s;e of the <HI>tender</HI> kind are with the mo&s;t difficulty governed.</P>
<P>I have applied to this our intellec|tual &s;overeign on a different principle. I implored her, not to in&s;pire me with that <HI>indifference</HI> which is the u&s;ual prayer of the di&s;appointed. The ob|ject
<PB N="155" REF="153">
of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almo&s;t unparalleled hazards. I &s;aw every hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became almo&s;t de&s;perate. I indulged the pa&s;&s;ion even till the in|di&s;&s;oluble bonds were tied again&s;t me. I &s;aw the madne&s;s of my pur&s;uit, and retired&mdash;retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge again&s;t a happy rival, but to manage my own wretch|edne&s;s, and to <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;erious appeal from the pa&s;&s;ions to the judgment is &s;eldom made in vain. We mi&s;carry, chiefly becau&s;e we are <HI>not</HI> &s;erious, but only <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> our&s;elves &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="154">I &s;elected a quiet hour, and laid the &s;imple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (thus I argued) is now hap|pily married. She is generous enough to pity and re&s;pect me for mi&s;ery that &s;he hath very unwillingly occa&s;ioned. Accidents have confirmed what Cor|bett at fir&s;t betrayed. I have too much contributed to her pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s for her to treat me untenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will in|crea&s;e her di&s;tre&s;s, even if it does not &s;pread it&s;elf in time to her hu&s;band. How bitterly does &s;he pay for my for|mer &s;ervices! What hinders her, now that &s;he is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my pa&s;&s;ion as in|&s;ulting and impious? Tho&s;e very
<PB N="157" REF="155">
&s;ervices. Do I then pre&s;ume, and per&s;ecute her upon the&s;e? Oh in|delicacy! oh folly!</P>
<P>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not po&s;&s;ible; it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary. To <HI>extingui&s;h bad</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, and to <HI>regulate good</HI> ones, are the two great points within the compa&s;s of rea&s;on. To covet any longer the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of Emma would be infamous. It is an inhibition of law, of religion, and of God. But, are the merely &s;en|&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions then at my age &s;o very gro&s;s, that by no exertion, no intere&s;t, I can &s;ubdue them? What will be the con&s;equence of my per&s;i&s;ting?

Henry, who&s;e heart melts in grati|tude towards me, and my own con|&s;cious upbraiding. Can I <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI> the&s;e, or is an ob&s;tinate attachment to the only point which rea&s;on refu&s;es me (and which, after all, is hopele&s;s,) &s;trong enough to &s;upport me? But <HI>what</HI> then am I to do? Does rea&s;on bring with her no compen&s;ations&mdash;no equipoi&s;e of rewards for puni&s;hments &s;o &s;evere? She does, and MANY.

<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the re&s;olution to exert them. We are afraid to <HI>begin.</HI> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the &s;teep, and are di&s;mayed. But every difficulty of &s;oul and body dimini&s;hes by earne&s;t per&s;everance. However cragged the mountain, or &s;lippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the &s;ummit; the &s;econd &s;tep is ea&s;ier than the fir&s;t, the third is &s;moother than the &s;econd. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the motive is <HI>&s;o great</HI> as to concern the happine&s;s of
<PB N="160" REF="158">
others, and our own duty is included, &s;urely we &s;hould &s;truggle to a&s;cend. <HI>I,</HI> Corbett, <HI>have</HI> &s;truggled&mdash;I cannot &s;ay how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the &s;incerity of my &s;oul, that though I am not, nor perhaps &s;hall EVER be again a <HI>happy</HI> man, I do not wi&s;h either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can &s;upport the pre&s;ence of both, when &s;oftne&s;s and wedded love &s;its <HI>faire&s;t</HI> upon their features. And, tho' many a ri&s;ing tear warns me that it is time to retire, no &s;entiment of irre|gular de&s;ire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friend&s;hip with kinde&s;t care; I do not impute to him, his <HI>happine&s;s</HI> as his <HI>fault.</HI> I recede not from his embrace, though I &s;eldom
<PB N="161" REF="159">
make advances to conver&s;ation that relates to Emma: and yet Emma is his perpetual &s;ubject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is &s;uch as corre&s;ponds with every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting &s;ituation than &s;he has to perform whenever I am pre&s;ent. It is indeed too much for a nature &s;o gentle, and &s;o ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cau&s;e. Humanity &s;hould not <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to be perfect. I have carried a con|que&s;t as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired &s;trength by an exami|nation of weakne&s;s. Let me not &s;ink into captivity by fool-hardine&s;s. I have done much. In attempting more, I may lo&s;e all the laurels I have

won. Involuntary thoughts will tre&s;|pa&s;s on the firme&s;t mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend. Hea|ven continue her &s;o, while earth hath a feeling to make life de&s;irable. But the familiar intercour&s;e of a private family is &s;omewhat too much for me at pre&s;ent.

<P>THE inclo&s;ed rough draft of let|ters will enable you, O, my friend, to trace the ve&s;tiges of &s;ome unhappy human beings &s;ince their departure from London to their return.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="189">At pre&s;ent, fortune &s;eems to con|tinue our wretchedne&s;s by means the mo&s;t complicate and inventive.</P>
<P>Two hours ago we arrived at the hou&s;e of the unfortunate Corbett. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty his daughter reached town.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that &s;truck her was a HEARSE &s;tanding clo&s;e be&s;ide her father's door. In the pa&s;&s;age &s;he be|held the undertakers bearing a coffin down &s;tairs. The woe-worn Corbett was &s;upported between two &s;ervants, to take his la&s;t mournful leave of the friend who&s;e remains were about to be depo&s;ited. He could not move. He had not received my letter from Port&s;|mouth,
<PB N="190" REF="190">
di&s;patched three days before. It had been mi&s;s-&s;ent. The letter did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival. He was not PREPARED to receive us.</P>
<P>Our chai&s;e drew up &s;till clo&s;er. Emma ru&s;hed out.&mdash;The poor old man&mdash;the daughter.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;We are not provided with a language to expre&s;s the&s;e horrors.&mdash;</P>
<P>Almo&s;t an hour the child and parent remained &s;peechle&s;s&mdash;it was &s;urpri&s;e and agony, at once dumb and dreadful.</P>
<P>The hear&s;e waited. The coffin was placed in it, and &s;hut up.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="191">The bell is at this in&s;tant tolling for POOR LOUISA: The &s;exton is come to tell the attendants that the clergy|man is waiting. Wretched wife of Edward! She died di&s;tracted. The hear&s;e is driving off.</P>
<P>What a hou&s;e is here! Alas, it has long and truly been the hou&s;e of mourning!</P>
<P>Corbett and Emma are &s;till toge|ther in the next room to that in which I write. The &s;ervants look amaze|ment and di&s;may.</P>

<P>In the expiring moment &s;he called me to her&mdash;"'Tis Emma's infant&punc; take it, &s;aid &s;he: it is a parting gift&mdash;I <HI>can</HI> no more&mdash;my father&mdash;my poor father!"&mdash;</P>

<P>WE are removed to Ca&s;tleberry. Oh, it was a gloomy and mournful greeting that I paid it!&mdash;Every tree, every book, every chair, figured before me as the <HI>&s;pectre of a buried joy. Emma</HI> enters the bo&s;om, and touches at a thou&s;and points.&mdash;Yet even in <HI>this</HI> woe, there is a mixt|ure of &s;weetne&s;s. I would not be without it. The mad metropolis, I am told, is ju&s;t illuminated for &s;uc|ce&s;s in battle .The hou&s;e of Corbett is an example of the rea&s;ons <HI>either</HI> party have to rejoice on this, or on any &s;imilar occa&s;ion. It is not an enemy that hath done this great mi&s;|chief
<PB N="208" REF="208">
&mdash;it is, we may truly &s;ay, our late familiar friend.</P>
<P>I enter the metropolis no more. A few years only can be mine. They &s;hall be engaged in reconciling my poor dear Corbett to life, on heaven's own terms, and preparing for infancy an ea&s;y cradle&mdash;for age a &s;mooth and peaceful pillow. Berkley, congratu|late me! My children are both well. The bounty of the Almighty is &s;till upon me.</P>
<P>Oh friend, receive my cordial ble&s;|&s;ing: let your heart be kind, your life be pure, and&mdash;</P>
<CLOSER>Farewell. <SIGNED>ROBERT RAYMOND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of our corre&s;pondence on this &s;ubject, receive the tri|bute of a tender, tearful moment&mdash;receive an epitaph for Emma's mar|ble. The <HI>little</HI> Emma will, I fondly fancy, re&s;emble her cherub mother: at lea&s;t, I am hourly &s;haping her lovely features into imaginary &s;imili|tude; and when affection is looking for a likene&s;s, &s;he either finds or forms it. But whatever be the <HI>exterior</HI> of this dear, <HI>dear</HI> legacy, oh may her <HI>mind</HI> take its colour from the parent; and Emma, who is in heaven, again give lu&s;tre to earth in the virtues of her child.</P>
