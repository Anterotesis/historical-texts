<P>WHAT's the matter, Tom? Why do&s;t look &s;o di&s;mal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Di&s;mal indeed! Well enough I may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the old mare dead? or work &s;carce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, work's plenty enough, if a man had but the heart to go to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What book art reading? Why do&s;t look &s;o like a hang dog?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(looking on his book.)</STAGE> Cau&s;e enough. Why I find here that I'm very unhappy, and very mi|&s;erable; which I &s;hould never have known if I had not had the good luck to meet with this book. O 'tis a precious book!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good &s;ign tho'; that you can't find out you're unhappy without looking into a book for it. What is the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matter? Why I want liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Liberty! What has any one fetched a warrant for thee? Come man, cheer up, I'll be bound for thee.&mdash;Thou art an hone&s;t fellow in the main, tho' thou do&s;t tipple and prate a little too much at the Ro&s;e and Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I want a new Con&s;titution.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Why I thought thou had&s;t been a de&s;perate healthy fellow. Send for the doctor then.</P>

<P>I'm not &s;ick; I want Liberty and Equa|lity, and the Rights of Man.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>O now I under&s;tand thee. What thou art a leveller and a republican I warrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm a friend to the people. I want a re|form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the &s;horte&s;t way is to mend thy|&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I want a <HI>general reform.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let every one mend one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! I want freedom and happine&s;s, the &s;ame as they have got in France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Tom, we imitate them? We fol|low the French! Why they only begun all this mischief at fir&s;t, in order to be ju&s;t what <HI>we</HI> are already. Why I'd &s;ooner go to the Negers to get learning, or to the Turks to get religion, than to the French for freedom and happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that? ar'n't the French free?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Free, Tom! aye, free with a witne&s;s. They are all &s;o free, that there's nobody &s;afe. They make free to rob whom they will, and kill whom they will. If they don't like a man's looks, they make free to hang him without judge or jury, and the next lamp-po&s;t does for the gal|lows; &s;o then they call them&s;elves free, becau&s;e you &s;ee they have no king to take them up and hang them for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, but Jack, didn't their KING formerly hang people for nothing too? and be&s;ides, wer'n't they all papi&s;ts before the Revolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, true enough, they had but a poor &s;ort of religion, but bad is better than none, Tom. And &s;o was the government bad enough too, for they could clap an innocent man into pri&s;on, and keep him there too as long as they would, and never &s;ay with your leave or by your leave, Gentlemen of the Jury. But what's all that to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>To us! Why don't our governors put many of our poor folks in pri&s;on again&s;t their will? What are all the jails for? Down with the jails, I &s;ay; all men &s;hould be free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harkee, Tom, a few rogues in pri&s;on keep the re&s;t in order, and then hone&s;t men go about their bu&s;ine&s;s, afraid of nobody; that's the way to be free. And let me tell thee, Tom, thou and I are tried by our peers as much as a lord is. Why the <HI>king</HI> can't &s;end me to pri&s;on if I do no harm, and if I do, there's rea&s;on good why I &s;hould go there. I may go to law with Sir John, at the great ca&s;tle yonder, and he no more dares lift his little finger again&s;t me than if I were his equal. A lord is hanged for hang|ing matter, as thou or I &s;hould be; and if it will be any comfort to thee, I my&s;elf remember a Peer of the Realm being hanged for killing his man, ju&s;t the &s;ame as the man wou'd have been for killing <HI>him.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Ferrers was hanged in 1760, for killing his Steward.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is &s;ome comfort.&mdash;But have you read the Rights of Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I. I had rather by half read the <HI>Whole Duty of Man.</HI> I have but little time for reading, and &s;uch as I &s;hould therefore only read a bit of the be&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me of tho&s;e old fa&s;hioned no|tions. Why &s;hould not we have the &s;ame fine things they have got in France? I'm for a <HI>Con&s;ti|tution,</HI> and <HI>Organization,</HI> and <HI>Equalization.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do be quiet. Now, Tom, only &s;uppo&s;e this non&s;en&s;ical equality was to take place, why it wou'd not la&s;t while one cou'd &s;ay Jack Robin&s;on; or &s;uppo&s;e it cou'd&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e, in the general divi&s;ion, our new rulers were to give us half an acre of ground a-piece; we cou'd to
<PB N="6" REF="5">be &s;ure rai&s;e potatoes on it for the u&s;e of our fa|milies; but as every other man would be equally bu&s;y in rai&s;ing potatoes for <HI>his</HI> family, why then you &s;ee if thou wa&s;t to break thy &s;pade, I &s;hould not be able to mend it. Neighbour Snip wou'd have no time to make us a &s;uit of cloaths, nor the clothier to weave the cloth, for all the world would be gone a digging. And as to boots and &s;hoes, the want of &s;ome one to make them for us, wou'd be a greater grievance than the tax on leather. If we &s;hou'd be &s;ick, there wou'd be no doctor's &s;tuff for us; for doctors woud be dig|ging too. We cou'd not get a chimney &s;wept, or a load of coal from pit, for love or money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;till I &s;hou'd have no one over my head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a mi&s;take: I'm &s;tronger than thou: and Standi&s;h, the exci&s;eman, is a better &s;cholar; &s;o we &s;hould not remain equal a minute. I &s;hou'd out-<HI>fight</HI> thee, and he'd out-<HI>wit</HI> thee, And if &s;uch a &s;turdy fellow as I am, was to come and break down thy hedge for a little firing, or to take away the crop from thy ground, I'm not &s;o &s;ure that the&s;e new-fangled laws wou'd &s;ee thee righted. I tell thee, Tom, we have a fine con|&s;titution already, and our fore-fathers thought &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were a pack of fools, and had never read the Rights of Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell thee a &s;tory. When &s;ir John mar|ried, my Lady, who is a little fanta&s;tical, and likes to do every thing like the French, begged him to pull down yonder &s;ine old ca&s;tle, and build it up in her frippery way. No, &s;ays Sir John; what &s;hall I pull down this noble build|ing, rai&s;ed by the wi&s;dom of my brave ance&s;tors; which out&s;tood the civil wars, and only under|went a little needful repair at the Revolution;
<PB N="7" REF="6">and which all my neighbours come to take a pat|tern by&mdash;&s;hall I pull it all down, I &s;ay, only be|cau&s;e there may be a dark clo&s;et or an inconve|nient room or two in it? My lady mumpt and grumbled; but the ca&s;tle was let &s;tand, and a glorious building it is, though there may be a trifling fault or two, and tho' a few decays may want &s;topping; &s;o now and then they mend a lit|tle thing, and they'll go on mending, I dare &s;ay, as they have lei&s;ure, to the end of the chapter, if they are let alone. But no pull-me-down works. What is it you are crying out for, Tom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why for a perfect government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might as well cry for the moon. There's nothing perfect in this world, take my word for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;ee why we are to work like &s;laves, while others roll about in their coaches, feed on the fat of the land, and do nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>My little maid brought home a &s;tory|book from the Charity-School t'other day in which was a bit of a fable about the Belly and the Limbs. The hands &s;aid, I won't work any longer to feed this lazy belly, who &s;its in &s;tate like a lord, and does nothing. Said the feet, I won't walk and tire my&s;elf to carry him about; let him &s;hift for him&s;elf; &s;o &s;aid all the members; ju&s;t as your levellers and republicans do now. And what was the con&s;equence? Why the belly was pinched to be &s;ure; but the hands and the feet, and the re&s;t of the members &s;uffered &s;o much for want of their old nouri&s;hment, that they fell &s;ick, pined away, and would have died, if they had not come to their &s;en&s;es ju&s;t in time to &s;ave their lives, as I hope all you will do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the times&mdash;but the taxes, Jack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things are dear, to be &s;ure: but riot and
<PB N="8" REF="7">murder is not the way to make them cheap. And taxes are high; but I'm told there's a deal of old &s;cores paying off, and by them who did not con|tract the debt neither, Tom. Be&s;ides things are mending, I hope and what little is done, is for us poor people; our candles are &s;omewhat cheaper, and I dare &s;ay, if the hone&s;t gentleman is not di&s;turbed by you levellers, things will mend every day. But bear one thing in mind: the more we riot, the more we &s;hall have to pay. Mind ano|ther thing too, that in France the poor paid all the taxes, as I have heard 'em &s;ay, and the quality paid nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I know what's what, as well as another; and I'm as fit to govern&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Tom, no. You are indeed as good as another man, &s;eeing you have hands to work, and a &s;oul to be &s;aved. But are all men fit for all kinds of things? Solomon &s;ays, "How can he be wi&s;e who&s;e talk is of oxen?" Every one in his way. I am a better judge of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe than Sir John; but he has a deal better notion of &s;tate affairs than I; and I can no more do without him than he can do without me. And few are &s;o poor but they may get a vote for a parliament-man, and &s;o you &s;ee the poor have as much &s;hare in the government as they well know how to manage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I &s;ay all men are equal. Why &s;hould one be above another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that's thy talk, Tom, thou do&s;t quarrel with Providence and not with government. For the woman is below her hu&s;band, and the children are below their mother, and the &s;ervant is below his ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the &s;ubject is not below the king: all kings are "crowned ruffians:" and all governments are wicked. For my part, I'm re&s;olved I'll pay no more taxes to any of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tom, Tom, this is thy non&s;en&s;e; if thou did&s;t go oftner to church, thou would&s;t know where it is &s;aid, "Render unto Ce&s;ar the things that are Ce&s;ar's;" and al&s;o, "Fear God, honour the king." Your book tells you that we need obey no government but that of the people, and that we may fa&s;hion and alter the government according to our whim&s;ies; but mine tells me, "Let every one be &s;ubject to the higher powers, for all power is of God, the powers that be are ordained of God; who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God." Thou &s;aye&s;t, thou will pay no taxes to any of them. Do&s;t thou know who it was that work'd a miracle, that he might have money to pay tribute with, rather than &s;et you and me an example of di&s;obedience to go|vernment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay we &s;hall never be happy, till we do as the French have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>The French and we contending for liber|ty, Tom, is ju&s;t as if thou and I were to pretend to run a race; thou to &s;et out from the &s;tarting po&s;t, when I am in already: why we've got it man; we've no race to run. We're there already. Our con&s;titution is no more like what the French one was, than a mug of our Taunton beer is like a platter of their &s;oup-maigre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know we &s;hall be undone, if we don't get a new <HI>con&s;titution</HI>&mdash;that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack</SPEAKER>
<P>And I know we &s;hall be undone if we do. I don't know much about politics, but I can &s;ee by a little, what a great deal means. Now only to &s;hew thee the &s;tate of public credit, as I think Tim Standi&s;h calls it. There's Farmer Furrow: a few years ago he had an odd 50l by him; &s;o to keep it out of harm's way, he put it out to u&s;e, on government &s;ecurity I think he calls it. Well;
<PB N="10" REF="9">t'other day he married one of his daughters, &s;o he thought he'd give her that 50l for a bit of a portion. Tom, as I'm a living man, when he went to take it out, if his fifty pounds was not grown almo&s;t to an hundred! and would have been a full hundred, they &s;ay, by this time, if the gentleman had been let alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, &s;till, as the old &s;aying is&mdash;I &s;hould like to do as they do in France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;hould'&s;t like to be murdered with as little ceremony as Hackabout, the butcher, knocks down a calf? Then for every little bit of tiff, a man gets rid of his wife. And as to liberty of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> which they brag &s;o much about, why they have driven away their par&s;ons, (aye and murdered many of 'em) becau&s;e they would not &s;wear as they would have them. And then they talk of liberty of the pre&s;s; why, Tom, only t'other day they hanged a man for printing a book again&s;t this pretty government of theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you &s;aid your&s;elf it was &s;ad times in France before they pull'd down the old govern|ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and &s;uppo&s;e the French were as much in the right as I know them to be in the wrong; what does that argue for <HI>us?</HI> Becau&s;e neighbour Furrow t'other day pulled down a cra|zy, old barn, is that a rea&s;on why I mu&s;t &s;et fire to my tight cottage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;ee why one man is to ride in his coach and &s;ix, while another mends the highway for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't &s;ee why the man in the coach is to <HI>drive over</HI> the man on foot, or hurt a hair of his head. And as to our great folks, that you level|lers have &s;uch a &s;pite again&s;t; I don't pretend to &s;ay they are a bit better than they &s;hould be; but
<PB N="11" REF="10">that's no affair of mine; let them look to that; they'll an&s;wer for that in another place. To be &s;ure, I wi&s;h they'd &s;et us a better example, about going to church, and tho&s;e things; but &s;till <HI>hoard|ing's</HI> not the &s;in of the age; they don't lock up their <HI>money</HI>&mdash;away it goes, and every body's the better for it. They do &s;pend too much, to be &s;ure, in fea&s;tings and fandangoes, and if I was a par&s;on I'd go to work with 'em in another kind of a way; but as I am only a poor trade&s;man, why 'tis but bringing more gri&s;t to my mill. It all comes among the people&mdash;Their coaches and their furniture, and their buildings, and their planting, employ a power of trade&s;-people and labourers.&mdash;Now in this village; what &s;hould we do without the ca&s;tle? Though my Lady is too rantipoli&s;h. and flies about all &s;ummer to hot water and cold water, and fre&s;h water and &s;alt water, when &s;he ought to &s;tay at home with Sir John; yet when &s;he does come down, &s;he brings &s;uch a deal of gentry that I have more hor&s;es than I can &s;hoe, and my wife more linen than &s;he can wa&s;h. Then all our grown children are &s;ervants in the family, and rare wages they have got. Our little boys get &s;omething every day by weeding their gardens, and the girls learn to &s;ew and knit at Sir John's expence; who &s;ends them all to &s;chool on a Sunday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but there's not Sir John's in every village.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more's the pity. But there's other help. 'Twas but la&s;t year you broke your leg, and was nine weeks in the Bri&s;tol Infirmary, where you was taken as much care of as a lord, and your family was maintained all the while by the pari&s;h. No poor-rates in France, Tom; and here there's a matter of two million and a halt
<PB N="12" REF="11">paid for them, if t'was but a little better managed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two million and a half!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, indeed. Not tran&s;lated into ten|pences, as your French millions are, but twenty good &s;hillings to the pound. But, when this le|velling comes about, there will be no Infirmaries, no ho&s;pitals, no charity-&s;chools, no &s;unday-&s;chools, where &s;o many hundred thou&s;and poor &s;ouls learn to read the word of God for nothing. For who is to pay for them? <HI>equality</HI> can't afford it; and tho&s;e that may be willing won't be able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we &s;hall be one as good as another, for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and bad will be the be&s;t. But we mu&s;t work as we do now, and with this difference, that no one will be able to pay us. Tom! I have got the u&s;e of my limbs, of my liberty, of the laws, and of my bible. The two fir&s;t, I take to be my <HI>natural</HI> rights; the two la&s;t my <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious;</HI> the&s;e, I take it, are the <HI>true Rights of Man,</HI> and all the re&s;t is nothing but non&s;en&s;e and madne&s;s and wickedne&s;s. My cottage is my ca&s;tle; I &s;it down in it at night in peace and thankfulne&s;s, and <Q>no man maketh me afraid.</Q> In&s;tead of indulging di&s;content, becau&s;e another is richer than I in this world, (for envy is at the bottom of your equality works,) I read my bible, go to church, and think of a trea&s;ure in heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but the French have got it in this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis all a lie, Tom. Sir John's butler &s;ays his ma&s;ter gets letters which &s;ay 'tis all a lie. 'Tis all murder, and nakedne&s;s, and hunger; many of the poor &s;oldiers fight without victuals, and march without clothes. The&s;e are your <HI>De|mocrats!</HI> Tom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, do&s;t think all the men on our &s;idewicked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;not &s;o neither&mdash;they've made fools of the mo&s;t of you, as I believe. I judge no man, Tom; I hate no man. Even republicans and le|vellers, I hope, will always enjoy the protection of our laws; though I hope they will never be our law-makers. There's many true di&s;&s;enters, and there's hollow churchmen; and a good man is a good man, whether his church has got a &s;teeple to it or not. The new fa&s;hioned way of proving one's religion is to hate &s;omebody. Now, though &s;ome folks pretend that a man's hating a Papi&s;t, or a Pre&s;byterian, proves him to be a good <HI>Church|man,</HI> it don't prove him to be a good <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> Tom. As much as I hate republican works, I'd &s;corn to <HI>live</HI> in a country where there's not liberty of con&s;cience; and where every man might not wor&s;hip God his own way. Now that they had not in France: the Bible was &s;hut up in an un|known heatheni&s;h tongue. While here, thou and I can make as free u&s;e of our's as a bi&s;hop; can no more be &s;ent to pri&s;on unju&s;tly than a judge; and are as much taken care of by the laws as the parliament man who makes them. And this levelling makes people &s;o di&s;mal. The&s;e poor French fellows u&s;ed to be the merrie&s;t dogs in the world; but &s;ince equality came in, I don't believe a Frenchman has ever laughed.</P>

<P>I'll tell thee how we are ruined. We have a king &s;o loving, that he woud'd not hurt the people if he cou'd; and &s;o kept in, that he cou'd not hurt the people if he wou'd. We have as much liberty as can make us happy, and more trade and riches than allows us to be good. We have the be&s;t laws in the world, if they were more &s;trictly enforced; and the be&s;t religion in the world, if it was but better followed. While Old England is &s;afe, I'll glory in her and pray for her, and when &s;he is in danger, I'll fight for her and die for her.</P>
