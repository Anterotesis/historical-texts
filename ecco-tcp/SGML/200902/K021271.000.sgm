<P>THE following little piece meeting with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, after having been withdrawn from the &s;tage, it may be expected that the author will &s;ay &s;ome|thing by way of apology for the &s;cene, which in its former &s;tate was deemed ex|ceptionable; it was almo&s;t a literal tran&s;|lation from the Poulet, a dramatic pro|verb, and pronounced by men of unque&s;|tionable judgement an excellent &s;ituation; but nothing is &s;o difficult to decide on with certainty, as the effect any incident will have in repre&s;entation. Much as was thought of the Poulet in the clo&s;et, it was much di&s;liked on the &s;tage, and the piece con&s;equently withdrawn for alteration. Fortunately for the author, he has &s;uc|ceeded in his &s;econd attempt to plea&s;e, and the farce is once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage.</P>

<SP>
<STAGE><HI>and &s;poken by</HI> Mr. LEE LEWES.</STAGE>
<L>STATESMEN and Poets, oft', one for|tune find;</L>
<L>This Court being di&s;content, our Bard re&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>That is to &s;ay, re&s;ign'd as Courtiers mean,</L>
<L>He was turn'd out, but would come in again.</L>
<L>On one good point he's bent, a reformation,</L>
<L>And bade me tell this grand A&s;&s;ociation,</L>
<L>He now has made a total alteration.</L>
<L>M1&s;takingly, he built on Gallic ground,</L>
<L>But prov'd French wit was, like French faith, un&s;ound;</L>
<L>Hence wi&s;er grown, he's cautious in his views,</L>
<L>And makes no foreign compacts for his Mu&s;e.</L>
<L>On foreign aid 'tis hazardous reliance,</L>
<L>But certain ruin's in a French alliance.</L>
<L>By Gar, Mon&s;ieur will &s;ay, you m1&s;take quite,</L>
<L><HI>Mon Pais,</HI> my country, be <HI>toujours</HI> right;</L>
<L><HI>Il faut vous allor,</HI> you mu&s;t go to France,</L>
<L>If you would learn to make <HI>bon alliance;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Par l'alliance Bourbon,</HI> we long trick you;</L>
<L><HI>Par l'alliance Amerique,</HI> trick dem too;</L>
<L><HI>Voila Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;taing,</HI> has he not play'd,</L>
<L>One pretty trick, in taking <HI>de Grenade?</HI></L>
<L>Is he not grand, invincible Hero?</L>
<L>Arrah, replies Teague, ask General Prevo&s;t!</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="5">So much with &s;hot he bother'd him, they &s;ay,</L>
<L>He play'd an old French trick, and ran away,</L>
<L>Now home to France he's gone with broken thigh,</L>
<L>His leg being wounded, kays he came too nigh;</L>
<L>And, by St. Patrick, he de&s;erv'd his fate,</L>
<L>Who wou'd not give the women a retraat;</L>
<L>Had but the Iri&s;h brigade been there,</L>
<L>They'd given their hearts before they'd hurt the fair.</L>
<L>But talk no more of Heroes&mdash;name me one,</L>
<L>Like the brave tar, who met the Spani&s;h Don</L>
<L>Without a &s;word, and gave him up his own.</L>
<L>Oh! &s;uch a trick, with all your ga&s;conade,</L>
<L>No French Mon&s;ieur, or Spaniard, ever play'd.</L>
<L>But, whil&s;t for valour's crown great nations &s;ight,</L>
<L>And wild Ambition takes the name of Right;</L>
<L>Ambiguous &s;tates, each diff'rent power to fleece,</L>
<L>Equal &s;u&s;pend the &s;cale of war and peace;</L>
<L>Abjure all principle, but that they've lent,</L>
<L>And know no intere&s;t, but cent. per cent;</L>
<L>But, rouz'd by wrongs, the Genius of this land,</L>
<L>In &s;elf-collected might, more firm &s;hall &s;tand;</L>
<L>Hibernia's cau&s;e, and Britain's, now made one,</L>
<L>We boa&s;t a fam'ly compact of our own;</L>
<L>Defies the treach'rous compact of Bourbon.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Ju&s;tice, as a flaming AEgis, throws</L>
<L>Confu&s;ion and di&s;may on England's foes;</L>
<L>Her thunder to the world &s;hall &s;peak again,</L>
