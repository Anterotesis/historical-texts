<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE De&s;ign of the following Pages, is to &s;hew the Relati|on the <HI>COLLECTS, EPI|STLES,</HI> and <HI>GOSPELS,</HI> from the fir&s;t Sunday in <HI>Ad|vent,</HI> till <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> have to their Re&s;pective Times and Sea&s;ons; and what Connection and Agreement every <HI>COL|LECT, EPISTLE,</HI> and <HI>GOSPEL</HI> for the Sundays after <HI>Trinity</HI> till <HI>Advent,</HI> have among them&s;elves. And this, I hope, may be of &s;ome Service, not only as it is exceedingly delightful to the Mind, to con&s;ider the Order, and Fitne&s;s, and Har|mony of the&s;e Offices, but as it will make them have that E&s;teem and Regard paid them, they ju&s;tly de&s;erve; as it will &s;peak clearly the Wi&s;dom of the Church in &s;o compiling them; as it will in&s;truct in a
<PB N="vi" REF="5">due Knowledge of Times and Sea&s;ons; and make them be a more <HI>Rea&s;onable Service,</HI> than they u&s;ually are with the mo&s;t of People.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop <HI>Sparrow,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wheatley,</HI> in their excellent Treati&s;es of the <HI>Common-|Prayer,</HI> have both of them treated of this in the Sundays before <HI>Trinity.</HI> But then what they have wrote on this Subject, is lodged in a Book which is not ea&s;ily got by tho&s;e, who will reap the greate&s;t Bene|fit from a Work of this Nature. I have therefore con&s;idered, in as narrow a Com|pa&s;s as I conveniently could, both the <HI>Of|fices</HI> before and after <HI>Trinity,</HI> in the Manner above mentioned. And this I have done not only from &s;uch Hints and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Moderns, (particularly the two great Men above-mentioned) as give any but al&s;o from the ancient <HI>RI|TUALISTS.</HI></P>
<P>I hope it will be no Fault, that it comes after &s;o many much more valuable and learned Treati&s;es on the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> as it aims at nothing more than the In|&s;truction of the Ignorant in this Part of it, which as far as I know has not hi|therto been &s;o publi&s;hed, as to be of Ser|vice to them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> ADVENT.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Word <HI>Advent</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Com|ing,</HI> and is appropriated to the Time preceeding <HI>Chri&s;t|ma&s;s</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hug. a San. Vict. Lib. <HI>3.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> to commemorate that Time, in which the Me&s;&s;iah was &s;o much ex|pected; and al&s;o to prepare us for his Coming in the Fle&s;h; For this Sea&s;on is to <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s-Day,</HI> what <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was to our Lord, <HI>a Fore-runner, and Preparer of the Way.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the Church in celebra|ting the mo&s;t remarkable Hi&s;tories of our Sa|viour's Life and Death, hath followed the Order they were done in, and plac'd them an&s;werable to their re&s;pective Times. Thus &s;he comme|morates his Nativity before his Death, and his Death before his Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion. And this is the Rea&s;on why the Office of our Lord's Advent, precedes the other Offices of the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e his Coming in the Fle&s;h was prior to all the Tran&s;actions the other Offi|ces were compil'd of. And as by the <HI>Advent</HI> of our Lord, there was a Renovation of Things, agreeable to that of St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Be|hold I make all Things new,</HI> &s;o the Church, in Honour of his <HI>Advent,</HI> begins her Year of Offices at the Time of Reno|vation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">THIS <HI>Advent</HI> lies in four Weeks, tho' as the Rituali&s;ts tell us, the&s;e four Weeks are ne|ver held intire. <Q>The Church, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> hath &s;et the&s;e apart, to denote and point out the <HI>Fourfold Coming</HI> of Chri&s;t, and that the la&s;t is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Chri&s;tma&s;s-Eve, they &s;ay, is no Part of <HI>Advent,</HI> and therefore the la&s;t Week is never com|pleat.</NOTE> incompleat, becau&s;e when he makes his la&s;t Appear|ance, the Glory of his Saints &s;hall have no End.

<P>THUS the Church delineates the&s;e four Comings of our Saviour, in her &s;etting apart the four Weeks of the&s;e Sea&s;ons: Tho' it is ob&s;erva|ble in her Offices appointed for them, &s;he only commemorates two of them, <HI>viz.</HI> his Coming in
<PB N="3" REF="8">the Fle&s;h and his Coming to Judgment; for his Coming in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> and his Coming into the <HI>Hearts of good Men,</HI> are in Effect but one Com|ing, as are al&s;o his Coming at <HI>the Hour of Death, and in the Day of Judgment.</HI></P>

<P>THE Collects are mo&s;t of them of great Antiquity, as is evident from many Autho|rities. They are &s;o called, either<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Microl. c. <HI>3.</HI></NOTE> becau&s;e the Prie&s;t that officiated collected into them the Devotions of the People, or, as being u&s;ed upon the People's being collected, or gathered together, or, as others think, and with greater Probability, be|cau&s;e of their being chiefly collected from the Epi&s;tles and Go&s;pels. But however this be, they are the Breathings of the Holie&s;t Times, and have been u&s;ed by the be&s;t of Men, and mu&s;t therefore be acknowledged of great Bene|fit and Advantage.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> are of equal Anti|quity with the Collects, and are ranged in an admirable Order, following each other in a natural Series of Things, and expre&s;&s;ing the Hi|&s;tory of the Sea&s;on they relate to. They are divided, as the Year is, into two Parts; the one beginning at <HI>Advent,</HI> and ending at <HI>Trinity Sun|day;</HI> the other then beginning, and ending at <HI>Advent.</HI> The Former &s;hews us the Example of our Lord, the Latter in&s;tructs us how to follow his Example.</P>

<HEAD>The fir&s;t Sunday in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Collect for this Day, is taken out of the <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and has a two-fold View, the one to remind us of his Coming in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> the other of his Coming to <HI>Judgment.</HI> It therefore im|plores the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, that now, in our Sa|viour's fir&s;t <HI>Advent,</HI> when he came to vi&s;it us, as <HI>the Prophet</HI> intimates in the <HI>Go&s;pel, in great Humility,</HI> we <HI>may &s;o ca&s;t off the Works of Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> that at his &s;e|cond Coming we may ri&s;e to the Life of Light and Glory.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE is an Exhortation to Love, which is in Effect the Fulfilling of the whole Law. And this it al&s;o excites us to, from the pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration of Things; <HI>That now it is high Time to awake out of Sleep. The Night is far &s;pent, the Day is at Hand:</HI> Which tho' fir&s;t of all wrote by the Apo&s;tle to the Chri&s;tian Converts, to &s;hake off their Sleep and Drow|&s;ine&s;s, and excite them to Vigilancy and Activity in the chri&s;tian Life: And tho' the <HI>Night</HI> here will undoubtedly &s;ignifie the Time of Life, in which we grope about, and wander in
<PB N="5" REF="10">Darkne&s;s, in Compari&s;on of that Day we &s;hall afterwards behold<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor.</HI> i. 13.</NOTE> when the Vail &s;hall be taken away, and <HI>we &s;hall</HI> no longer <HI>&s;ee through a Gla&s;s darkly;</HI> yet it al&s;o mu&s;t remind us of the Circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on, and bring into our Minds, that Night which hung upon the World before our Saviour's Coming, and how it was di&s;pelled and driven a|way, by the <HI>Day-&s;pring from on high.</HI> When then the&s;e Words are read, <HI>the Night is far &s;pent,</HI> &amp;c. Our Hearts &s;hould be filled with Joy and Comfort. For they &s;hould repre&s;ent to us the World's long lying in Darkne&s;s, that now the Shadows are fleeing away, and that the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;&s; is approaching; That the Na|tivity of the Me&s;&s;iah, the Saviour of the World is near.</P>
<P>The GOSPEL of our Saviour's Riding to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> has been the Peculiar of this fir&s;t Sun|day in Advent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Microl. de Eccle&s;. Ob&s;. c. <HI>31.</HI></NOTE> from ancient Times. It &s;eems, indeed, rather proper for <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> which was the Day he made this Journey on to his Pa&s;&s;i|on, and is accordingly u&s;ed by &s;ome Churches; But yet when we con&s;ider the Words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Ho&s;an|na in the highe&s;t, i. e.</HI> ble&s;&s;ed be his Coming in the Fle&s;h, for which is due the greate&s;t Ho&s;an|nahs, we may &s;ee mani&s;e&s;tly its Harmony to the Sea&s;on, in the<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">Bi&s;h.

<HEAD>The &s;econd SUNDAY in <HI>Advent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Collect is taken out of the Epi&s;tle, which mentions, that <HI>whatever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scrip|tures, might have hope:</HI> And therefore it &s;ays, a little after, <HI>as it is written,</HI> and &s;o mentions &s;ome Prophecies relating to our Saviour's fir&s;t Coming into the World. The Collect there|fore will appear very &s;uitable for the Time, if it be con&s;ider'd as a Petition to God, that we may receive all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coll.</NOTE> <HI>his holy World,</HI> and at this Sea&s;on that Part of it in par|ticular, which Prophe&s;ies of our Lord's fir&s;t Coming into the World, that <HI>me may be</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Fpi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>comforted by it, and ever hold fa&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Hope of everla&s;ting Life.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE treats of our Lord's fir&s;t Advent, and in a particular Manner how he came to &s;ave us of the <HI>Gentile</HI> World; and men|tions &s;ome Prophecies relating to us, that we may be <HI>comforted</HI> by them, and<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>glorifie God for his Mercy:</HI> As fir&s;t that in the 18th <HI>P&s;alm, For this Cau&s;e I will con|fe&s;s to the among the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and &s;ing Prai&s;es unto thy Name:</HI> And that in <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> the xxxii, <HI>Rejoyce ye</HI> Gentiles <HI>with his People.</HI> And again <HI>P&s;alm</HI> the cxvii, <HI>Prai&s;e him all ye</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and laud him all ye People:</HI> And la&s;tly <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in his xi Chapter &s;ays, <HI>There &s;hall be a Root of</HI> Je&s;&s;e, <HI>and he that &s;hall ri&s;e to reign over the</HI> Gen|tiles, <HI>in him &s;hall the</HI> Gentiles <HI>tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">The GOSPEL treats of our Lord's &s;econd Coming to judge the World, as the Epi&s;tle did of his fir&s;t Coming into it: Which may teach us, That tho&s;e Men, who will not receive the Fir&s;t Coming of their Saviour, will be compell'd to acknowledge Him at his Second.

<P>Thus the Church in this Day's Office, prepares us for the fir&s;t Coming of our Lord, by threat|ening us with the Terrors of his Second; by a&s;&s;uring us, we mu&s;t bear the Troubles of that <HI>Evil-Day,</HI> if we an&s;wer not the End and De|&s;ign of our Saviour's fir&s;t Coming, by leading holy and religious Lives.</P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="13">THE Collect is taken out of the Epi&s;tle and Go&s;pel, and is a Petition to our Lord, that<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>the Mini&s;ters and Stewards of his My&s;teries,</HI> may in like Manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Go&s;p.</NOTE> <HI>pre|pare his Way</HI> again&s;t his Coming to Judgment, as<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Go&s;p.</NOTE> <HI>his Me&s;&s;enger at his fir&s;t Coming prepar'd it before him.</HI></P>

<P>The GOSPEL treats of our Saviour's fir&s;t Coming, and gives us the Hi&s;tory of <HI>John</HI>'s Sen|ding two of his Di&s;ciples to him, who were to learn from him&s;elf, <HI>Whether it was he that &s;hould come, or they were to look for another.</HI> This the Bapti&s;t did, not to &s;atisfy any Doubt of his own, for he was perfectly convinc'd of the Truth of our Saviour's Mi&s;&s;ion; but that as he was &s;hort|ly to leave the World, his Di&s;ciples, who were not as yet fully &s;atisfied, might be convinc'd and become his Di&s;ciples.</P>

<P>The EPISTLE does as it were point out the Coming of our Lord, not as at a Di&s;tance, but in ha&s;t and immediately: <HI>The Lord is at Hand.</HI> How &s;ea&s;onably therefore does it advi&s;e us, <HI>to Rejoyce in the Lord?</HI> As it were exhorting us to be chearful, becau&s;e of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s near and &s;peedy Coming into the World.</P>
<P>As the GOSPEL of the la&s;t Sunday told us of the Me&s;&s;enger who &s;hould prepare the Way before our Lord's Coming; &s;o the pre&s;ent Go&s;pel &s;hews us this Me&s;&s;enger, in the Exerci&s;e of his Errand, in an actual Preparation for Chri&s;t's Coming, and <HI>making &s;traight the Way of the Lord,</HI> And the&s;e Words, <HI>There &s;tandeth One among you, whom ye know not, he it is who coming,</HI> &amp;c. are very agreeable to the Sea&s;on: They do all but bring the Me&s;&s;iah.

<P>THE Collect mentions him as born at this Time, and prays that we may be regenerated and made the Children of God by Adoption and Grace, and be daily renewed by the Holy Spirit, which are the Benefits of Chri&s;t's Birth.</P>

<P>THE Collect acknowledging <HI>with the Mar|tyr of the Day,</HI> the Divinity of our Lord, prays to him, in Imitation of the Martyr, that in <HI>all our Sufferings here for the Te&s;timony of the Truth,</HI> we may with him, <HI>look up &s;tedfa&s;tly, into Hea|ven, and by Faith behold the Glory which &s;hall be revealed; And being filled with the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as he was, <HI>we may learn,</HI> from him, to pray for our Per&s;ecutors to our Lord, <HI>who &s;tandeth at the Right Hand of God,</HI> as he &s;aw him, to Succour tho&s;e who &s;uffer for him.</P>

<P>The EPISTLE mentions <HI>the Doctrine of this holy Apo&s;tle and Evangeli&s;t,</HI> which the Col|lect prays the Church may be enlightened by, <HI>viz.</HI> the Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity, which he &s;o &s;ublimely treats of in his Go&s;pel, beginning it in the &s;ame Manner, he begins the pre&s;ent E|pi&s;tle.

<HEAD>The SUNDAY after <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was u&s;ual in the primitive Times, for &s;ome Part of the Offices of great Fe&s;tivals, to be repeated every Day, 'till the Octave, or eighth Day after, which was the la&s;t Day of its being repeated, and the End of the Fe&s;tival. The
<PB N="15" REF="20">Church therefore in Imitation of this ancient Cu|&s;tom, has the Collect of Chri&s;tma&s;s-Day, for this Day al&s;o, which generally falls within the Octave of Chri&s;tma&s;s. Bi&s;hop <HI>Sparrow</HI> tells us, the Ob|&s;ervation of Octaves is done out of Honour to the Fea&s;t, and that greater Solemnities have &s;ome Days after them, to continue the Memory of them.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of their being lengthen'd to eight Days, is taken from the <HI>Jews,</HI> who ob&s;erv'd &s;ome of their higher Fe&s;tivals, for the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Amar. Gor.

<P>BUT according to others there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rupert, de Divin. Offic. Lib. <HI>8.</HI> c. <HI>5.</HI> b. Juon. Carnot. Serm. de Cir|cum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> is a my&s;tical Meaning in the Ob&s;er|vation of Octaves, and that is, that the Octave is an Emblem of the My&s;tical eight Day, which is the Day of the Re&s;urrection. For as on that Day we &s;hall return to our former Inno|cence, &s;o the Church, as an Emblem of it, re|peats on the Octave, and the Days between the Fe&s;tival and it, &s;ome of the fir&s;t Days Office; thereby teaching us, that if we continue in the Wor&s;hip of God, after being regenerated by Bapti&s;m, we &s;hall on the Octave of the Re&s;ur|rection, after the &s;even Days of our Life have pa&s;&s;ed away, return to our fir&s;t Purity and Ho|line&s;s.</P>
<P>The EPITLE treats of our Saviour's Birth, and mentions the Advantages accruing to us from thence: That whereas before, the Church of
<PB N="16" REF="21">God, <HI>like an Heir under Age, differed nothing from a Servant,</HI> being burthened with Ceremo|nies, and the Ob&s;ervations of the Law; it was now by the Coming of his Son, arriv'd at Ma|turity, and freed from tho&s;e Incumbrances, &s;o that its Members <HI>are</HI> no more <HI>Servants;</HI> But Sons and Heirs of God, through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Church &s;eems to have cho&s;en this E|PISTLE with a View to our Saviour's Infan|cy: <HI>For the Heir under Age, differing nothing from a Servant, tho' he be Lord of all;</HI> is no ob|&s;cure or mean Remembrancer of our Saviour's Condition at this time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Heb. <HI>i.</HI></NOTE> who was appointed Heir of all Things; and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>yet took upon him the Form of a Ser|vant,</HI> tho' he<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> x. 36.</NOTE> <HI>was Lord of all.</HI></P>

<P>THE Collect is a Petition to God, that <HI>as he made his own Son to be circumci&s;ed,</HI> &s;o he would grant us the <HI>Circumci&s;ion of the Spirit,</HI> which is, <HI>the Cutting off from our Hearts and Members all worldly Lu&s;ts;</HI> That as our Lord by the Circum|ci&s;ion of the Fle&s;h was obedient to the Law, &s;o we by <HI>the Circumci&s;ion of the Spirit, may be obe|dient to his Will.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE al&s;o is very &s;uitable to the Fe&s;tival, as it &s;hews who they are that are the Ble&s;|&s;ed of God; whether tho&s;e of the Circumci&s;ion or tho&s;e of the Uncircumci&s;ion; That tho&s;e who follow the Faith of our <HI>Father Abraham, which he had, yet being uncircumci&s;ed,</HI> will have Right|eou&s;ne&s;s imputed unto them, as he had, and be numbered among the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> tho' they are not of the Circumci&s;ion.</P>

<P>The EPISTLE an&s;wers the Nature of the Sea|&s;on, and tells us, <HI>that the Gentiles &s;hould be fel|low Heirs, and of the &s;ame Body, and Partakers of his Promi&s;e in Chri&s;t by the Go&s;pel, and that St.</HI> Paul <HI>preach'd among the Gentiles, the un&s;earch|ble Riches of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Fa&s;t is of &s;uch great Antiquity, that is &s;eems to have been u&s;ed from the Days of the Apo&s;tles.

<P>THE Rea&s;on of its continuing forty Days is becau&s;e that forty Days were of old, the al|lowed and &s;tated Times of great Fa&s;ts; Witne&s;s the Fa&s;ts of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias;</HI> But the chief Rea|&s;on with us, is, that our Saviour Fa&s;ted forty Days.</P>

The&s;e intro|duced them into the Church, where the Bi|&s;hop all in Tears, and the Re&s;t of the Clergy, repeated the &s;even Penitential P&s;alms; Then ri&s;ing from Prayers, they threw A&s;hes upon them, and covered their Heads with Sackcloth, and then with mournful Sighs declar'd to them, that as <HI>Adam</HI> was thrown out of Pa|radi&s;e, &s;o they mu&s;t be thrown out of the Church. Then the Bi&s;hop commanded the Officers to turn them out of the Church Doors, and all the Clergy followed after, repeating that Cur&s;e upon <HI>Adam, In the Sweat of thy Brows thou &s;halt eat thy Bread.</HI></Q></P>

<P>THE Rea&s;on of this Exerci&s;e at this Time, is that our Hearts and Minds may be the better prepared to <HI>A&s;cend with Chri&s;t</HI> the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> fol|lowing, and that the Fruits of the Earth, which at this Time are young and tender, may avoid being hurt; that God would avert his Judg|ments

<P>THE Collect ob&s;erving in the Go&s;pel, that <HI>What&s;oever we ask the Father in Chri&s;t's Name we &s;hall receive,</HI> acknowledges that <HI>it is God from whom all good Things</HI> come; and then prays that he would &s;end his Holy Gho&s;t into our Hearts, that by <HI>his Holy In&s;piration</HI> we may be puri|fied with good Thoughts, and obtain Strength and Power to bring them to good Effect.</P>
<P>The EPISTLE teaches us how we may obtain the <HI>Comforter</HI> the Collect prays for, <HI>viz. by being Doers of the World and not Hearers</HI> only. For they who hear the Word only, are like the <HI>Seed</HI> which fell upon the <HI>Way-&s;ide,</HI> on the Rock, and among the <HI>Thorns,</HI> which were <HI>trodden down, withered away</HI> and <HI>choaked; But</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>the Doers of the</HI> Word, <HI>are</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sexag. <HI>Sun.</HI></NOTE> <HI>they which hear the Word of God and keep it,</HI> are the <HI>Seed</HI> which fell on good Ground, which brings <HI>forth Fruit with Patience.</HI> And therefore <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>not a forgetful Hearer, but a Doer of the Work, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his Deed,</HI> or &s;hall obtain the promi&s;ed Comfor|ter.</P>

<HEAD>ASCENSION-DAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Church having celebrated the Re&s;ur|rection of her Saviour, doth in a regular Cour&s;e of Things come to his A&s;cen&s;ion.

<P>THE Collect prays that God would &s;end us Grace to imitate, as much as we are able, the A&s;cen&s;ion of our Saviour; that as he really a&s;|cended in his Humane Nature, &s;o we may al&s;o a&s;cend in our Hearts and Minds, and dwell con|tinually with him there.</P>

<P>THE Collect is very &s;uitable to the Sea&s;on, and in Imitation of the Condition the Apo&s;tles were in at this Time, prays, as the Apo&s;tles may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have done, that God <HI>would not leave us comfortle&s;s;</HI> but &s;end to us <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t to comfort us, and exalt us into the &s;ame Place, whither our Saviour Chri&s;t is gone before.</HI></P>
<P>The EPISTLE (con&s;idering what the Col|lect prays for, <HI>viz.</HI> that we may obtain the <HI>Com|forter and be exalted into the Heavens</HI>) &s;hews us the Way of obtaining both the one and the other. <HI>If we be &s;ober, and watch unto Prayer,</HI> as it advi&s;es us, following the Examples of the A|po&s;tles

<P>The GOSPEL is the Promi&s;e of the Com|forter, which the Epi&s;tle exhorts to pray for, and which therefore our Church does pray for, in this Day's Collect. It is &s;uitable to this Time, as it is the Promi&s;e of the <HI>Comforter</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> were now <HI>expecting.</HI></P>

<P>It has the Name of Penteco&s;t, becau&s;e there are Fifty Days between <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Whit&s;unday,</HI> as it was Fifty Days between the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> and the Jewi&s;h Penteco&s;t.

<P><PB N="57" REF="62">The la&s;t Sunday the Church, being as it were in <HI>Expectation</HI> of the Coming of the Comforter, prayed in the <HI>Collect</HI> that God would &s;end him; but now the Comforter being come, &s;he prays in this Day's Collect, that God would &s;end <HI>her a true Judgment in all Things, and everla&s;ting Joy in the Comfort of that Holy Spirit.</HI></P>

<P>The EPISTLE mentions the De&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> was prea|ching to them, and at the Clo&s;e it mentions Bap|ti&s;m, telling us how the Gentiles were <HI>Baptized in the Name</HI> of the Lord.

<P>THE Epi&s;tle, &s;uitable to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Bap|tizing</HI> at this Sea&s;on, and of <HI>Confirming</HI> which was al&s;o now u&s;ed, is concerning Bapti&s;m
<PB N="59" REF="64">and Confirmation; and is al&s;o very proper for the Practice of the Church, at the latter Part of the Week, the Time of fa&s;ting and praying for an holy and regular Mini&s;try.

We may &s;ee therefore how agreeable this is to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Ordaining</HI> at this Time; For it teaches us, that there is a Difference of Orders, becau&s;e there is a Difference of Power: <HI>Philip</HI> could <HI>baptize,</HI> but he could not <HI>confirm;</HI> which &s;hews, that the Power of <HI>Ordaining</HI> (being at lea&s;t equally great with that of <HI>Confirming</HI>) can be lodged no where but in the Bi&s;hop, or the highe&s;t Order.
