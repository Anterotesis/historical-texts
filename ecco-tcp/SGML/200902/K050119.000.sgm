<L>THE &s;tage &s;hould be, to life, a faithful gla&s;s,</L>

<L>If the&s;e extravagant appear to you,</L>
<L>Blame not the drama,&mdash;the reflection's true&mdash;</L>
<L>Our Author makes of virtue no parade,</L>
<L>And only ridicules the <HI>vice</HI> of trade;</L>
<L>Expo&s;es Folly in its native tint,</L>
<L>And leaves, mankind to profit by the hint.</L>
<L>The modern buck,&mdash;how diff'rent from the beau</L>

<L>The city coxcomb then was &s;eldom &s;een,</L>

<L>Or, like a &s;hadow, pa&s;s'd unheeded by:</L>
<L>Trade&s;man and rake were then remov'd as far</L>
<L>As gay St James's is from Temple-bar.</L>
<L>But now the cit mu&s;t breathe a purer air,</L>
<L>The 'Change he <HI>vi&s;its</HI>&mdash;lives in Badford-&s;quare&mdash;</L>

<L>The man of fa&s;hion with the man of trade.</L>
<L>Vain to a&s;&s;ociate with &s;uperior rank,</L>

<L>This empty air-blown bubble breaks at la&s;t!</L>
<L>Tho' trade may give &s;uch up&s;tart mu&s;hrooms birth,</L>

<L>To rai&s;e dejected mis'ry from the ground.</L>
<L>While commerce, with a lib'ral heart be&s;tows</L>
<L>Her wealth, to mitigate the poor man's woes;</L>
<L>Seeks out the wretch, his gloomy pri&s;on cheers,</L>

tears out the vitals exi&s;tence; it &s;hivers the ada|mantine bands of &s;ociety; it makes curds and whey of the milk of human kindne&s;s; it convul&s;es and confu&s;es, and di&s;turbs and di&s;torts&mdash;Oh! whatever you do, never libel an attorney.</P>

<P>She has indeed&mdash;and I beg pardon of her &s;ex, to whom &s;he this given this le&s;&s;on&mdash;that the affection and duty of a daughter is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for happi|ne&s;s in a wife; and that filial affection and feminine diffidence is THE WAY TO GET MARRIED.

<P>Sir, I've bade adieu to all my air-drawn fan|cies, except the wool&s;ack, in which whim I will once more indulge, in the trembling hope, that our endea|vours this night to plea&s;e, have been crowned with your candid approbation. As many as are content &s;ay "Aye." &mdash; non-contents, "No." We flatter our&s;elves the contents have it.</P>

<L>THE dubious title of our Play this night</L>
<L>Might fill mama with joy, or mi&s;s with fright.</L>
<L>"The Way to get a Hu&s;band," and what not;&mdash;</L>
<L>But are they worth the getting when they're got?</L>
<L>"Yes," cries bold mi&s;s,&mdash;whom mother's kind rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></L>
<L>Has led, at young fourteen, to cock her card,</L>
<L>"Yes," cries bold mi&s;s, "whate'er the formals &s;ay,</L>
<L>They are worth getting, and I know the way.</L>
<L>&mdash;The way's up Bond-&s;treet! where we daily range,</L>
<L>Where &s;auntering bloods crowd Fa&s;hion's full exchange!</L>
<L>There (charming &s;cene!) as undi&s;may'd we &s;trut&mdash;</L>
<L>Dogs, mi&s;&s;es, dukes, and draymen, meet full butt!</L>
<L>There, lounging arm in arm, half-booted crops,</L>
<L>With heads &s;o dark, you'd &s;wear they were&mdash;black mops!</L>
<L>There, mu&s;lin petticoats with mud &s;o lac'd&punc;</L>

<L>So &s;carlet all, my rouge they &s;eem to &s;coff,</L>
<L>And look like lob&s;ters with their tails cut off!</L>
<L>Here for a hu&s;band is the &s;cene to da&s;h,</L>
<L>Here for a town-bred mi&s;s to&mdash;make a &s;pla&s;h.</L>
<L>The plump, bri&s;k widow takes a different road,</L>
<L>She cannot walk down Bond-&s;treet:&mdash;&s;he's a load!</L>
<L>Good &s;ixteen &s;tone to carry&mdash;but yet &s;trong:</L>
<L>She rolls a wool-pack Venus,&mdash;broad as long!</L>
<L>Yet &s;he's a tender pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;tage!</L>
<L>With her, dear <HI>private acting</HI> is the rage.</L>
