<STAGE>(<HI>Martha &s;tanding by a table cutting two &s;lices of bread and butter.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>AFTER having laboured &s;o hard during the be&s;t part of our lives, thus at la&s;t to fall into poverty! To what pur|po&s;e is it, that we have never cea&s;ed our cares and pains for a &s;ingle moment, in or|der to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be &s;omething! My dear chil|dren, it is not for my&s;elf, it is for you that I &s;hed tears; in lo&s;ing our cattle we have lo&s;t our all. What remains is far from be|ing &s;ufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? If my good hu&s;band did not &s;upport my &s;inking courage, I &s;hould
<PB N="2" REF="6">die with grief. But how worthy a cha|racter he is! What a man! How tranquil in the mid&s;t of our misfortunes! Were I not &s;ure that affection makes him conceal the greate&s;t part of his troubles from the fear of afflicting me, I &s;hould believe he were in|&s;en&s;ible to them. "Why do&s;t thou weep, Martha?" he often &s;ays, when I can no longer re&s;train my tears: "We have had a lo&s;s, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in &s;tore for us? I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas! though never rich him&s;elf, he was always a friend to the unfortunate! How many fa|milies in this village has he &s;aved from mi|&s;ery by his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance! There is not a better man on earth; and I &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s what many women want in the mid&s;t of riches, a worthy hu&s;band, and children who&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions fill our hearts with joy. Whil&s;t I think on the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to con&s;ole thee in thy affliction.

<P>Nay, now you increa&s;e my curio|&s;ity, and I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely know the bottom of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, &s;ince you command it, I will tell you all: ye&s;terday evening we overheard my father &s;ay to you, &s;ince we have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of our cattle, we mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the will of Heaven, and try to turn this misfortune into a ble&s;&s;ing; we mu&s;t be the more diligent and indu&s;trious, and &s;trive with all po&s;&s;ible oeconomy to &s;upport our family. You replied, with an embrace, that you would be the fir&s;t to &s;et the example. I made a &s;ign to my &s;i&s;ter to retire; we em|braced each other al&s;o; whatever you had engaged to do for us, we agreed together in return to do for you.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear children, you take too large a &s;hare in our troubles, they are not &s;uited to your age; fear nothing, Heaven will have care of you. Oh, my child, you have made me feel the happine&s;s of being a mother. What earthly good can equal the joy which this in&s;tance of your tender duty has given me! but be comforted. I have re|&s;erved the remainder of this for you, and you may, at lea&s;t to-day, eat your bread as u&s;ual; it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould get &s;trength, in order to earn &s;omething for us when you grow older. Will you not be glad to labour for your father and mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, glad indeed! that I &s;hall; but we can begin now: our hands, it is true, are &s;mall, but we will work the longer for that, and all that we earn we will give to my father to purcha&s;e more cattle. Then we will rear poultry and &s;ell our eggs; and this money, all this money, we will gladly bring to you, dear mother. <STAGE>(Seeing the tears in her mother's eyes.)</STAGE> Oh, do not weep, I be&s;eech you; you make my heart &s;ink.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be &s;atisfied; if I weep it is for joy; but it is time that thou &s;hould'&s;t breakfa&s;t. There are many things to do in the hou&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="10">and I would have thy father find every thing in order at his return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he gone into the field with my brothers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he took a walk down to the hall; he wanted to &s;peak with our land|lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, &s;o much the better. My fa|ther always came home in good &s;pirits from him. That Mr. Parks is an excellent man, is he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, hitherto he has been very good to us; pray Heaven he may con|tinue to be &s;o now we have occa&s;ion for it. But &s;ince our great lo&s;&s;es, we are no longer in a condition to pay our rent; and often tho&s;e who have &s;hewn us the greate&s;t kind|ne&s;s, whil&s;t we owed them nothing, look upon us with a very different eye when they think they are in danger of lo&s;ing by us.</P>

<P>But there will be no occa&s;ion for any more expence on that account. Does not my brother Valentine read as fluently as our &s;choolma&s;ter at his de&s;k?

Si&s;ter, &s;aid he, you know that I am allowed half an hour's re&s;t after dinner be|fore I return to work; well then, if you will, during that time, begin a le&s;&s;on with me, I will fini&s;h it when I come home in the evening.

I come al&s;o to offer you all that I have left in the world: it is a great trouble to me that I have not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy you; but I promi&s;e, on the word of an hone&s;t man, to labour night and day till I can do &s;o.

Ah! if you had &s;uch children as I have; if you loved them with all your &s;oul, and were beloved by them as I am!&mdash;In &s;aying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I &s;aw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned towards his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other.

You mu&s;t know, ju&s;t before the di&s;order appeared, we had made a joint purcha&s;e of twelve cows at a neigh|bouring fair. It is true, I advanced two|thirds of the money; but upon his con&s;ent|ing to graze them for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him in point of money, as we &s;et|tled it) I told him that whatever of the herd &s;hould e&s;cape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no rea&s;on to think that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I &s;hould be far from taking advantage of it if it regarded my&s;elf alone; but I am no longer ma&s;ter of my own. I am obliged to give up all my remain|ing

<P>Are you mad, Thorowgood? why you have the law on your &s;ide; till your grain is made over to your landlord, by &s;ome &s;e|curity, it belongs to you, and you may do what you plea&s;e with it. Come, come, you have lo&s;t too much already; a&s;k Martha what &s;he thinks of the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think that we ought, in the fir&s;t place, to pay our debts, at any rate; if we have lo&s;t our cattle, our landlord has not gained by it; the lo&s;s, therefore, is our affair, not his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But you mu&s;t not carry this &s;o far as to deprive your&s;elf of bread. You ought to keep &s;omething in re&s;erve to be above want.</P>

<P>Come, come, do not be &s;o &s;tiff; take my advice; it depends all on the man|ner in which we &s;ee things.

<P>I do not de&s;ire it, indeed; there is little to be got by this way of rea&s;oning.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know as well as my&s;elf, Sir, that I had drained the mar&s;hes in order to make them fit for pa&s;ture, and they were in a thriving way. All the money that we had remaining la&s;t year, we laid out in cattle, in order to fatten them for &s;ale. Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune, which promi&s;ed fair to pay our rent, by &s;ending a few of them off to market. A drought came on; there was &s;carcely a blade of gra&s;s in my fields: I fed my cattle with the &s;traw of my bed, the thatch of my barn, and &s;ome|times with the vegetables that were for my family's u&s;e. When I wanted to get rid of them, I could find no purcha&s;er, owing to the &s;carcity of fodder. A murrain got among&s;t them, and I lo&s;t them all: I owe nothing, however, to any body but to you, Sir. Come and look at your grounds, you will &s;ee whether I have neglected to culti|vate them; you will &s;ee if my own labour, with that of my wife and children, may not enable me one day to pay all my debts: I can, however, give you no other &s;ecurity
<PB N="61" REF="65">than my own word; but as I have always been punctual, till now, in my engagements with you, I &s;hould hope that you would have &s;ome reliance on my promi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friends, I do know you. Why &s;hould I not be content with the promi&s;e of &s;uch hone&s;t, worthy people as you are?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give you thanks, Sir; your kind words are &s;till more plea&s;ing than your good|ne&s;s it&s;elf. How &s;eldom will a creditor give the character of an hone&s;t man to the debtor by whom he has lo&s;t?</P>

<P>No, Sir, begging your pardon; the latter are &s;till more &s;o; the former are knaves, but the others are mon&s;ters.

<PB N="93" REF="97">that in ca&s;e the old tree &s;hould peri&s;h, my mother might &s;till have &s;ome good ap|ples; had we left the farm, it would have been a &s;ad thing; &s;omebody el&s;e would have come into it, and in time have eaten of the fruit which we had engrafted.</P>

<P>It is a melancholy &s;tory:&mdash;We then lived in the north of England; I rented a farm there on the banks of a river; it was an excellent &s;ituation, and the land yielded abundantly;&mdash;no thanks to the care of the former tenant though&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;s over the&s;e circum&s;tances, pray, and only tell me all that relates to Va|lentine; that alone inflames my curio&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once; you mu&s;t know, that one night we were rou&s;ed from our &s;leep by the water's ru&s;hing into our hou&s;e on all &s;ides: we had hardly time to get upon the roof to wait for relief there: in the morning a boat came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of hou&s;es and furniture, carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lamented the lo&s;s of our cottage, but &s;till more that of her &s;on,
<PB N="98" REF="102">who was &s;tifled in the water before he awoke; in the mean time, I &s;uddenly per|ceived a cradle, to&s;&s;ed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to &s;wallow it up. I could not bear the &s;ight; I threw off my clothes, and, regardle&s;s of danger, I plunged into the river, &s;wimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back &s;everal times, and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap|proached, in&s;pired me with fre&s;h &s;pirits and vigour: in &s;hort, after much difficulty and danger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank a good way lower down. My wife followed me creeping, more dead than alive, along the &s;ide of the river. I pre&s;ented the infant to her, which continued crying until &s;he gave it the brea&s;t. Poor Martha fancied that &s;he had recovered her lo&s;t child. We then made all po&s;&s;ible inquiries to &s;ee if we could di&s;cover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length cea&s;ed; we continued to look upon him as our own &s;on. I have related the whole &s;tory to the boy him&s;elf a hundred times: I concealed it indeed from my own children, to let them enjoy the plea&s;ure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all
<PB N="99" REF="103">occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y. I have had him in|&s;tructed like the re&s;t: he does his work as well as I can my&s;elf: he talks as if he were reading out of a book: and he can read and write as well as our &s;choolma&s;ter.</P>

Come, Martha, to divert you a little, &s;eat the chil|dren, and bring us &s;ome gla&s;&s;es. <STAGE>(Whil&s;t Martha is engaged, he turns to Mr. Parks,)</STAGE> I told you, Sir, ju&s;t now, that virtue never failed of a reward; here you &s;ee a proof of it. You had &s;carcely performed a good ac|tion before you were in&s;tantly recompen&s;ed for it. You gave us property that was no longer ours, and we have given you an only &s;on, whom you had con&s;idered as lo&s;t. <STAGE>(He gets up, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to George, Jenny, and Lucy, who, during this whole &s;cene remain &s;ilent, with their eyes continually fixed on Mr. Parks or Valentine.)</STAGE> And you, my children,
<PB N="117" REF="111">hence learn never to de&s;pair of heaven or your&s;elves. When a flood, fifteen years ago, &s;wept away my cottage, Providence gave me, at the &s;ame time, the means of requit|ing one day the man who was de&s;tined to be my benefactor. This day, when the effects of an unfavourable &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed to threaten me with hopele&s;s de&s;truction, it has, on the contrary, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed my little fortune. God makes u&s;e of every thing to reward tho&s;e who do their duty. It is from two of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;courges that we have de|rived our good fortune: let this be a le&s;&s;on to you all your lives! When a man acts right, though misfortune &s;hould per&s;ecute him, though the lightning &s;hould fla&s;h round his head, and thunder &s;hake every thing about him, &s;o long as he has no reproach to make to him&s;elf, he remains firm as a rock, <STAGE>(&s;trik|ing the table)</STAGE> or if he falls for a moment, he ri&s;es up again with new vigour&mdash;a gla&s;s of wine, Sir. <STAGE>(He takes up the bottle and fills round.)</STAGE> It is, that we may all drink your health.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t willingly, my friend, as the recital can no longer di&s;tre&s;s me: I had been married a year when a war broke out, and I received orders to proceed with my re|giment to the We&s;t-Indies: my wife, not|with&s;tanding all entreaties, would accom|pany me in that long and dangerous voyage, after giving birth to this dear boy, the only
<PB N="109" REF="113">one that we have left. I had an uncle, a dig|nitary of the church, who lived near Dur|ham; the infant was con&s;igned to a nur&s;e in his neighbourhood, that he might have an eye to him, and give us information about him. I received no account the three fir&s;t years of my ab&s;ence. Unea&s;y at &s;o long a &s;ilence, I wrote to &s;ome friends in London: the mo&s;t zealous of them vi&s;ited the place, whence he acquainted me, that &s;oon after my departure, a &s;udden inundation had ravaged the coun|try, that my uncle had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions on that calamitous occa|&s;ion; that the hou&s;e of the nur&s;e had been &s;wept away by the flood, and that my &s;on peri&s;hed with her; this dreadful news op|pre&s;&s;ed me with &s;orrow, and almo&s;t broke my wife's heart. At my return to England, I was re&s;trained from making any re&s;earches, which appeared u&s;ele&s;s, le&s;t my ill &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould revive tho&s;e bitter &s;orrows which time had &s;omewhat alleviated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, for &s;ix years that I have been your tenant, and might have put an end to your grief! I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf for having &s;uffered you to pine &s;o long. I often told you of my happine&s;s, why did you ne|ver mention your &s;orrows to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I have thought that
<PB N="110" REF="114">you alone were capable of terminating them! And be&s;ides, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I endea|voured all in my power to bani&s;h the&s;e &s;ad reflections from my mind. I was particu|larly fearful of reviving them in the com|pany of my wife. This very morning, when you wanted to talk about your children, don't you recollect how cautiou&s;ly I endeavoured to turn the conver&s;ation to other &s;ubjects?</P>

<P>Do not flatter your&s;elf with that ex|pectation, Sir; he will make you &s;hed tears as long as you live, but they will be tears of joy only.

<SP>

<P>It is to your in&s;tructions, my worthy friends, that I am indebted for his merit; it was under you he learned to reli&s;h &s;entiments of honour and virtue. I have the

<P>Reward us! Oh, that he has done a long time &s;ince; Valentine him&s;elf has taken care of that: night and day he has laboured all inches power for our benefit. Do you imagine that without his care and toil our fields would have pro&s;pered as they have done?</P>

<P>No, father it is but right to tell you of what they, perhaps, would conceal, le&s;t they might again intere&s;t your genero&s;ity of heart; all my efforts were due to them for their care and tenderne&s;s to me in my infant years, and I had no merit in working for them; but as indu&s;trious as they are, my hands were nece&s;&s;ary to them: if they lo&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is my duty to make them a compen&s;ation&mdash;there is but one method: luckily it depends on the fir&s;t favour I have to &s;olicit at your hands, and you will not &s;urely refu&s;e me in this joyful and happy moment; will you, father?</P>

Then the air is not very cold at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, and for one night he will not die with hunger.

Then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpo&s;e, after which he drives the creature out into the &s;treet, and off he &s;ets that in&s;tant, &s;o that the poor perri|wig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud, before its owner can lay hold of it again.</P>

<P>And yet this is nothing to the &s;tories that I could tell you. Why, he lames or brui&s;es all the dogs and cats that
<PB N="152" REF="156">come within his reach. Nor is it long ago, when one of his relations broke a leg, by &s;lipping down upon the &s;tairs where Roberts had been &s;cattering peas on purpo&s;e. Ay, it is &s;o; or el&s;e our name is not Danby. And for the &s;ervants, I am &s;ure, his father would not get one to attend him, if he did not pay extraordinary wages.</P>

<P>Shall I tell you now? I long to &s;ee him. I like boys a little merry.</P>

<P>Nothing is more natural: but Roberts's mirth is not like other chil|dren's. You, I know, love laughing in your heart; but would not, for the world, hurt any one; whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and brui&s;es.</P>

<P>On the contrary, he thinks me his be&s;t friend. I have &s;eemed willing to go &s;hares with him in a trick that he means to put upon the little ones above; but it is him|&s;elf that he will trick, and never wi&s;h to come here a third time.</P>

<P>You are in the right, Danby. One is nothing but politene&s;s, and the other quite a &s;avage.</P>

<P>What a piece of &s;ervice Frank would do us, could he clear the hou&s;e of &s;uch a fellow! We &s;hall have no plea&s;ure all the evening if he &s;tays among us.</P>

<P>I am afraid, however, Frank will proceed too far, and think him&s;elf permitted to do any thing again&s;t this Roberts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elder Danby.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can never do enough; and though his &s;cheme &s;hould be a little hard on Roberts, there will be in&s;truction in it: it is the greate&s;t &s;ervice that one can do him: and his father, I am per&s;uaded, will be plea&s;|ed with Frank, when he hears what pains he has taken to in&s;truct his &s;on. Alas! he would part with half his fortune to have Ro|berts like him.</P>

<P>So, Lucy, do not you go about to thwart your brother's good intentions.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, my dear Mi&s;s Alice, I am in a tickli&s;h &s;ituation: I am now in&s;tead of my

<P>No, ladies, that is not nece&s;&s;ary. There is a little violence, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, in my plot, and therefore I will not make you parties. I have been &s;ettling every thing with Ralph in the &s;table. He conceives my meaning clearly, and will &s;econd it with great dexterity.</P>

<P>This is all of the contrivance that you need know. We will go to Blind-man's Buff, that Roberts may &s;u&s;pect no harm on his return.
