<HEAD>HYMN TO THE NAIADS.</HEAD>

<ARGUMENT>
<PB REF="4">
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Nymphs who pre&s;ide over &s;prings and rivulets are ad|dre&s;&s;ed at day-break in honour of their &s;everal functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the fir&s;t allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the gene|ration of the Gods and the ri&s;e of things. They are then &s;ucce&s;&s;ively con&s;idered, as giving motion to the air and ex|citing &s;ummer-breezes; as nouri&s;hing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulne&s;s of na|vigable rivers, and con&s;equently to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means, to the maritime part of mi|litary power. Next is repre&s;ented their favourable in|fluence upon health, when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by rural exerci&s;e: which introduces their connection with the art of phy&s;ic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal &s;prings. La&s;tly, they are celebrated for the friend&s;hip which the Mu&s;es bear them, and for the true in&s;piration which temperance only can receive: in oppo&s;ition to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the more licentious poets.</P>

<L>There hardly was room left to thru&s;t in your &s;kull.</L>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Whereupon the bold Sutton fir&s;t mounted the &s;tage,</L>
<L>Made his honours as u&s;ual, and yearn'd to engage;</L>
<L>Then Figg, with a vi&s;age &s;o fierce, yet &s;edate,</L>
<L>Came, and enter'd the li&s;ts, with his fre&s;h-&s;haven pate;</L>
<L>Their arms were encircled with armigers too,</L>
<L>With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue.</L>
<L>Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt &s;houlder, and elbow,</L>
<L>Shook hands, and went to 't, and the word it was Bilboe.</L>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Sure &s;uch a concern in the eyes of &s;pectators,</L>
<L>Was never yet &s;een in our amphi-theatres.</L>
<L>Our commons and peers from their &s;everal places,</L>
<L>To half an inch di&s;tance all pointed their faces;</L>
<L>Wnile the rays of old Phoebus, that &s;hot thro' the &s;ky-light,</L>
<L>Seem'd to make on the &s;tage a new kind of twilight;</L>
<L><PB N="288" REF="290">And the Gods without doubt, if one cou'd but have &s;een 'em,</L>

<L>Figg &s;truck the fir&s;t &s;troke, and with &s;uch a va&s;t fury,</L>
<L>That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I a&s;&s;ure you;</L>
<L>And if his brave rival this blow had not warded,</L>
<L>His head from his &s;houlders had quite been di&s;carded.</L>
<L>Figg arm'd him again, and they took t' other tilt,</L>
<L>And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt;</L>
<L>The weapons were frighted, but as for the men,</L>
<L>In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonder</L>
<L>Every &s;troke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em a&s;under.</L>
<L>Yet &s;o great was their courage, &s;o equal their &s;kill,</L>
<L>That they both &s;eem'd as &s;afe as a thief in a mill;</L>
<L>While in doubtful attention dame Victory &s;tood,</L>
<L>And which &s;ide to take cou'd not tell for her blood,</L>
<L>But remain'd like the a&s;s, 'twixt the bundles of hay,</L>
<L>Without ever &s;tirring an inch either way.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Till Jove to the Gods &s;ignified his intention</L>
<L>In a &s;peech that he made 'em too tedious to mention;</L>
<L>But the up&s;hot on 't was, that at that very bout,</L>
<L>From a wound in Figg's &s;ide the hot blood &s;pouted out;</L>
<L>Her lady&s;hip then &s;eem'd to think the ca&s;e plain,</L>
<L>But Figg &s;tepping forth with a &s;ullen di&s;dain,</L>
<L>Shew'd the ga&s;h, and appeal'd to the company round,</L>
<L>If his own broken &s;word had not given him the wound.</L>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>That brui&s;es, and wounds a man's &s;pirit &s;hou'd touch,</L>
<L>With danger &s;o little, with honour &s;o much!</L>
<L>Well, they both took a dram, and return'd to the battle,</L>
<L>And with a fre&s;h fury they made the &s;words rattle;</L>
<L>While Sutton's right arm was ob&s;erved to bleed,</L>
<L>By a touch from his rival; &s;o Jove had decreed;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t enough for to &s;hew that his blood was not icor,</L>
<L>But made up, like Figg's, of the common red-liquor.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Again they both ru&s;h'd with as equal a fire on,</L>
<L>'Till the company cry'd, hold, enough of cold iron,</L>
<L>To the quarter-&s;taff now, lads. So fir&s;t having dram'd it,</L>
<L>They took to their woods, and i' faith never &s;ham'd it.</L>
<L>The fir&s;t bout they had was &s;o fair, and &s;o hand&s;ome,</L>
<L>That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ran&s;om;</L>
<L>And Sutton &s;uch bangs on his neighbour imparted,</L>
<L>Wou'd have made any fibres but Figg's to have &s;marted.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Then after that bout they went on to another&mdash;</L>
<L>But the matter mu&s;t end on &s;ome fa&s;hion, or other;</L>
<L>So Jove told the Gods he hath made a decree,</L>
<L>That Figg &s;hou'd hit Sutton a &s;troke on the knee.</L>
<L>Tho' Sutton di&s;abled as &s;oon as he hit him</L>
<L>Wou'd &s;till have fought on, but Jove wou'd not permit him;</L>
<L>'Twas his fate, not his fault, that con&s;train'd him to yield,</L>
<L>And thus the great Figg became lord of the field.</L>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now, by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friends, brought this Collection of POEMS to a com|petent &s;ize, it has been thought proper that the farther pro|gre&s;s of its growth &s;hould here be &s;top'd. From the loo&s;e and fugitive pieces, &s;ome printed, others in manu&s;cript, which for forty or fifty years pa&s;t have been thrown into the world, and carele&s;sly left to peri&s;h; I have here, according to the mo&s;t judicious opinions I could obtain in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing their merits, endeavour'd to &s;elect and pre&s;erve the be&s;t. The favourable reception which the former volumes have met with, demands my warme&s;t acknowledgments, and calls for all my care in compleating the Collection; and in this re&s;pect, if it appear that I have not been altogether negligent, I &s;hall hope to be allow'd the merit, which is all I claim, of having furni&s;h'd to the Public an elegant and polite Amu&s;ement. Little more need be added, than to return my thanks to &s;everal ingenious friends, who have obligingly contributed to this Entertainment. If the reader &s;hould happen to find, what I hope he &s;eldom will, any pieces which he may think unworthy of having been in&s;erted; as it would ill become me to attribute his di&s;like of them to his own want of Ta&s;te, &s;o I am too con&s;cious of my own deficiencies not to allow him to impute the in|&s;ertion of them to mine.</P>
