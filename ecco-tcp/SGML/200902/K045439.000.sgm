<HEAD>THE SUNDAY SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed, in the Cottage Cook, to give &s;ome account of the manner in which Mrs. Jones &s;et up her &s;chool. She did not much fear being able to rai&s;e the money, but money is of little u&s;e, un|le&s;s &s;ome per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and piety can be found to direct the&s;e in&s;titutions. Not that I would di&s;|courage tho&s;e who &s;et them up even in the mo&s;t ordinary manner, or from mere views of worldly policy. It is &s;omething gained to re&s;cue children from idling away their Sabbath in the fields or the &s;treets. It is no &s;mall thing to keep them from tho&s;e tricks to which a day of lei&s;ure tempts the idle and the ignorant. It is &s;omething for them to be taught to read; it is much to be taught to read the Bible, and much indeed to be carried regu|larly to church. But all this is not enough. To bring the&s;e in&s;titutions to an&s;wer their highe&s;t end can only be effected by God's ble&s;&s;ing on the fol|lowing means, the choice of able teachers, and a diligent attention in &s;ome pious gentry to vi&s;it and in&s;pect the &s;chools.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On RECOMMENDATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones had one talent that eminently quali|fied her to do good, namely judgment; this even in the gay part of her life had kept her from many mi&s;takes, but though &s;he had &s;ometimes been de|ceived her&s;elf, &s;he was very careful not to deceive others, in recommending people to fill any office either through &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or fal&s;e kindne&s;s. She u&s;ed to &s;ay, "there is always &s;ome one appropriate quality which every per&s;on mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, in order
<PB N="4" REF="3">to fit them for any particular employment. Even in this quality," &s;aid &s;he to Mr. Simp&s;on the Clergy|man, "I do not expect perfection; but if they are de&s;titute of this, whatever good qualities they may po&s;&s;e&s;s be&s;ides, though they may do for &s;ome other employment, they will not do for this. If I want a pair of &s;hoes, I go to a &s;hoemaker; I do not go to a man of another trade however ingenious he may be, to a&s;k him if he cannot <HI>contrive</HI> to make me a pair of &s;hoes. When I lived in London I learnt to be much on my guard as to recommenda|tions. I found people often wanted to impo&s;e on me &s;ome one who was a burthen to them&s;elves. Once I remember when I undertook to get a ma|tron for an ho&s;pital, half my acquaintance had &s;ome one to offer me. Mrs. Gib&s;on &s;ent me an old cook whom &s;he her&s;elf had di&s;charged for wa&s;ting her own provi&s;ions, yet &s;he had the con&s;cience to re|commend this woman to take care of the provi|&s;ions of a large community. Mrs. Grey &s;ent me a di&s;carded hou&s;ekeeper who&s;e con&s;titution had been ruined by &s;itting up with Mrs. Grey's gouty hu&s;band, but who &s;he yet thought might do well enough to undergo the fatigue of taking care of an hundred poor &s;ick people. A third friend &s;ent me a woman who had no merit but that of being very poor, and it would be charity to provide for her. The truth is, the lady was obliged to allow her a &s;mall pen&s;ion till &s;he could get her off her own hands by turning her on tho&s;e of others."</P>
<P>"It is very true, Madam," &s;aid Mr. Simp&s;on, "the right way is always to prefer the good of the many to the good of one; if indeed it can be cal|led doing good to any one to place them in a &s;ta|tion in which they mu&s;t feel unhappy, by not know|ing
<PB N="5" REF="4">how to di&s;charge the duties of it. I will tell you how I manage. If the per&s;ons recommended are objects of charity, I privately &s;ub&s;cribe to their wants; I pity and help them, but I never promote them to a &s;tation for which they are unfit, and thus hurt a whole community to help a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed individual."</P>
<P>Thus Mrs. Jones re&s;olved, that the fir&s;t &s;tep to|wards &s;etting up her &s;chool &s;hould be to provide a &s;uitable mi&s;tre&s;s. The ve&s;try were &s;o earne&s;t in recommending one woman that &s;he thought it worth looking into. On enquiry, &s;he found it was a &s;cheme to take a large family off the pari&s;h; they never con&s;idered that a very ignorant woman, with a family of young children, was not fit for a &s;chool, all they con&s;idered was that the profits of the &s;chool might enable her to live without pari&s;h pay. Mrs. Jones refu&s;ed another, though &s;he could read well and was decent in her conduct, becau&s;e &s;he u&s;ed to &s;end her children to the &s;hop on Sundays. And &s;he objected to a third, a very &s;en&s;ible woman, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of making an outward profe&s;&s;ion of religion a cloak for immoral conduct. Mrs. Jones knew &s;he mu&s;t not be too nice neither, &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t put up with many faults at la&s;t. "I know," &s;aid &s;he to Mr. Simp&s;on, "the imper|fection of every thing that is human. As the mi&s;tre&s;s will have much to bear with from the chil|dren, &s;o I expect to have &s;omething to bear with in the mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to our re&s;pective trials, by thinking how much God has to bear with in us all. But there are three things which a mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t not be without, <HI>good &s;en&s;e, activity,</HI> and <HI>piety.</HI> Without the fir&s;t &s;he will mi&s;|lead others, without the &s;econd &s;he will neglect
<PB N="6" REF="5">them, and without the third, though &s;he may civi|lize, yet &s;he will never chri&s;tianize them."</P>
<P>Mr. Simp&s;on &s;aid, "he really knew but of one per&s;on in the pari&s;h who was fully likely to an&s;wer her purpo&s;e: this" continued he "is no other than my hou&s;e keeper, Mrs. Betty Crew. It will indeed be a great lo&s;s to me to part from her; and to her it will be a far more fatiguing life than &s;he at pre|&s;ent leads. But ought I to put my own per&s;onal comfort, or ought Betty to put her own ea&s;e and quiet, in competition with the good of above an hundred children? This will appear &s;till more im|portant if we con&s;ider the good done, not as <HI>fruit</HI> but <HI>&s;eed;</HI> if we take into the account how many yet unborn may become chri&s;tians, in con&s;equence of our making the&s;e children chri&s;tians. For how can we calculate the number which may be here|after trained for heaven, by tho&s;e very children we are going to teach, when they them&s;elves &s;hall become parents, and you and I are dead and for|gotten? To be &s;ure, by parting from Betty my pea&s;e-&s;oup will not be quite &s;o well flavoured, nor my linen &s;o neatly got up; but the day is fa&s;t ap|proaching when all this will &s;ignify but little; but it will not &s;ignify a little whether one hundred im|mortal &s;ouls were the better from my making this petty &s;acrifice. Betty Crew is a real chri&s;tian, has excellent &s;en&s;e, and had a good education from my mother. She has al&s;o had a little &s;ort of training; for when the poor children come to the par&s;onage for the broth on a Saturday evening, Betty is u&s;ed to appoint them all to come at the &s;ame time, and after &s;he has filled their pitchers &s;he ranges them round her in the garden, and exa|mines them in their catechi&s;m. She is ju&s;t and fair
<PB N="7" REF="6">in dealing out the broth and beef, not making my favour to the parents depend on the &s;kill of their children. But her own old caps, and ribbons, and ca&s;t off cloaths, are be&s;towed as little rewards on the be&s;t &s;cholars. So that taking the time &s;he &s;pends in working for them, and the things &s;he gives them, there is many a lady who does not ex|ceed Betty in acts of charity; this I mention to confirm your notion, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be rich in order to do good; a religious upper &s;ervant has great opportunities of this &s;ort."</P>
<P>My readers I tru&s;t need not be informed, that this is that very Mrs. Betty Crew who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mrs. Jones in teaching poor women to cut out linen and cook cheap di&s;hes, as related in the Cottage Cook. Mrs. Jones in the following week got to|gether as many of the mothers as &s;he could; and &s;poke to them as follows.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. <HI>JONES's EXHORTATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"My good women, on Sunday next I pro|po&s;e to open a &s;chool for the in&s;truction of your children. Tho&s;e among you who know what it is to be able to read your Bible will, I doubt not, rejoice that the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing is held out to your children. You who are <HI>not</HI> able your&s;elves to read what your Saviour has done and &s;uffered for you, ought to be doubly anxious that your children &s;hould reap a ble&s;&s;ing which you have lo&s;t. Would not that mother be thought an unnatural mon&s;ter who &s;hould &s;tand by and &s;natch out of her child's mouth the bread which a kind friend had ju&s;t put into it? But &s;uch a mother would be merciful com|pared with her who &s;hould rob her children of the opportunity of learning to read the word of God when it is held out to them. Remember, that if
<PB N="8" REF="7">you &s;light the pre&s;ent offer, or if after having &s;ent your children a few times you &s;hould afterwards keep them at home under vain pretences, you will have to an&s;wer for it at the day of judgment. Let not your poor children <HI>then</HI> have cau&s;e to &s;ay "my fond mother was my wor&s;t enemy. I might have been bred up in the fear of the Lord and &s;he op|po&s;ed it for the &s;ake of a little paltry plea&s;ure, for an idle holiday, I am now brought to the gates of hell." My dear women, which of you could bear to &s;ee your darling child condemned to ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction? which of you could bear to hear him accu&s;e you as the cau&s;e of it? Is there any mother here pre&s;ent who will venture to &s;ay, 'I will doom the child I bore to &s;in and hell, ra|ther than put them or my&s;elf to a little pre&s;ent pain by curtailing their evil inclinations, I will let them &s;pend the Sabbath in ignorance and idlene&s;s in&s;tead of &s;ending them to &s;chool!' Let that mother, who values her child's plea&s;ure more than his &s;oul, now walk away, and I will &s;et down the names of all tho&s;e who wi&s;h to bring their young ones up in the way that leads to eternal life, in&s;tead of indulg|ing them in the plea&s;ures of &s;in which are but for a moment."</P>
<P>When Mrs. Jones had done &s;peaking, mo&s;t of the women thanked her for her good advice, and hoped that God would give them grace to follow it; promi&s;ing to &s;end their children con&s;tantly. Others, who were not &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed were yet afraid to refu&s;e, after the &s;in of &s;o doing had been &s;o plainly &s;et before them. The wor&s;t of the wo|men had kept away from this meeting, re&s;olving to &s;et their faces again&s;t the &s;chool. Mo&s;t of them who were pre&s;ent, as &s;oon as they got home &s;et
<PB N="9" REF="8">about providing their children with what little de|cent apparel they could rai&s;e. Many a willing mother lent her tall daughter her hat, be&s;t cap, and white handkerchief, and many a grateful father &s;pared his linen wai&s;tcoat and bettermo&s;t hat to induce his grown up &s;on to attend; for it was a rule with which Mrs. Jones began, that &s;he would not receive the younger children out of any fa|mily who did not &s;end their elder ones. Too many made excu&s;es that their &s;hoes were old, or their hat worn out. But Mrs. Jones told them not to bring any excu&s;es to her which they could not bring to the day of judgment; and among tho&s;e excu&s;es &s;he would hardly admit any except accidents, &s;ick|ne&s;s, or attendance on &s;ick parents, or young children.</P>

<HEAD>SUBSCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones was very de&s;irous of getting the help and countenance of the farmers and trade&s;people, who&s;e duty &s;he thought it was to &s;upport a plan, calculated to improve the virtue and happine&s;s of the pari&s;h. Mo&s;t of them &s;ub&s;cribed, and pro|mi&s;ed to &s;ee that their workmen &s;ent their children. She met with little oppo&s;ition till &s;he called on farmer Ho&s;kins. She told him, as he was the riche&s;t farmer in the pari&s;h, &s;he came to him for a hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;cription. "Sub&s;cription!" &s;aid he, "it is nothing but &s;ub&s;criptions I think; a man had need be made of money." "Farmer," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "God has ble&s;&s;ed you with abun|dant pro&s;perity, and he expects you &s;hould be li|beral in proportion to your great ability." "I do not know what you mean by ble&s;&s;ing," &s;aid he; "I have been up early and late, lived hard while I had little, and now when I thought I had got for|ward
<PB N="10" REF="9">in the world, what with tythes and &s;ub&s;crip|tions it all goes I think." "Mr. Ho&s;kins," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "this is but an ungrateful return for all your ble&s;&s;ings." "You are again at your ble&s;|&s;ings," &s;aid the Farmer, "but let every one work as hard as I have done and I dare &s;ay he will do as well. It is to my own indu&s;try I owe what I have. My crops have been good, becau&s;e I minded my ploughing and &s;owing." "O farmer!" cried Mrs. Jones, "you forget who&s;e &s;uns and &s;howers make your crops to grow; but I do not come here to preach but to beg." "Well madam, what is it now? Flannel or French? or weavers, or a new church, or large bread, or cheap rice? or what other new whim-wham for getting the money out of ones pocket?" "I am going to e&s;tabli&s;h a Sunday &s;chool farmer, and I come to you as one of the principal inhabitants, hoping your example will &s;pur on the re&s;t to give." "Why then," &s;aid the farmer, "as one of the principal inhabitants I will give nothing, hoping it will &s;pur on the re&s;t to refu&s;e. Of all the fooli&s;h inventions, and new-fangled devices to ruin the country, that of teaching the poor to read is the very wor&s;t." "And I, farmer, think that to teach good principles to the lower cla&s;&s;es is the mo&s;t likely way to &s;ave the country. Now in order to this we mu&s;t teach them to read." "Not with my con&s;ent nor my money," &s;aid the farmer, "for I know it always does more harm than good." "So it may," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "if you only teach them to read and then turn them adri&s;t to find out books for them&s;elves. There is a pronene&s;s in the heart to evil which it is our duty to counteract, and which I &s;ee you are promoting. Only look round your own kitchen, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee it hung round
<PB N="11" REF="10">with loo&s;e &s;ongs and ballads. I grant indeed it would be better for your men and maids, and even your daughters, not to be able to read at all then to read &s;uch &s;tuff as this. But if when they a&s;k for bread you will give them a &s;tone, nay wor&s;e, a &s;erpent, your's is the blame." Then taking up a pen|ny book which had a very loo&s;e title, &s;he went on, "I do not wonder if you who read &s;uch books as the&s;e think it &s;afer that people &s;hould not read at all." The farmer grinned, and &s;aid it is hard if a man of my &s;ub&s;tance may not divert my&s;elf; when a bit of fun co&s;ts only a penny, and a man can &s;pare that penny, there is no harm done. When it is very hot or very wet, and I come in to re&s;t and have drank my mug of cider, I like to take up a bit of a je&s;t book or a comical &s;tory, to make me laugh. "O Mr. Ho&s;kins," replied Mrs. Jones, "when you come in to re&s;t from a burning &s;un or &s;hower, do you never think of him who&s;e &s;un it is that is ripening your corn? or who&s;e &s;hower is filling the ear or cau&s;ing the gra&s;s to grow? I could tell you of &s;ome books which would &s;trengthen &s;uch thoughts, whereas &s;uch as you read only &s;erve to put them out of your head." Mrs. Jones having taken pains to let Mr. Ho&s;kins know, that all the genteel and wealthy people had &s;ub&s;cribed, he at la&s;t &s;aid, "Why, as to the matter of that I do not value a crown; only I think it might be better be|&s;towed, and I am afraid my own workmen will fly in my face if once they are made &s;cholars, and that they will think them&s;elves too good to work." "Now you talk &s;oberly and give your rea&s;ons," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "weak as they are, they de&s;erve an an&s;wer. Do you think that either man, woman, or child ever did his duty the wor&s;e, only becau&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="11">he knew it the better?" "No, perhaps not." "Now the whole extent of learning which we intend to give the poor, is only to enable them to read the Bible, a book in which every duty is explained, every doctrine brought into practice, and the brighte&s;t truths made level to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding. The knowledge of that book and its practical influence on the heart is the be&s;t &s;ecurity you can have, both for the indu&s;try and obedience of your &s;ervants. Now can you think any man will be the wor&s;e &s;ervant for being a good chri&s;|tian?" "Perhaps not," "are not the duties of children, of &s;ervants, and the poor expre&s;sly &s;et forth in the Bible?" "Yes." "Do you think any duties are likely to be &s;o well performed from any human motives, &s;uch as fear or prudence, as from the&s;e religious motives which are backed with the &s;anctions of rewards and puni&s;hments, of heaven or hell? Even upon your own principles of worldly policy, do you think a poor man is not le&s;s likely to &s;teal a &s;heep or a hor&s;e, who was taught when a boy, that it was a &s;in to rob a hen-roo&s;t or an or|chard? Will your property be &s;ecured &s;o effec|tually by the &s;tocks on the green, as by teaching the boys in the &s;chool, that <HI>for all the&s;e things God will bring them into judgment?</HI> Is a poor fellow who can read his Bible &s;o likely to &s;leep or to drink away his few hours of lei&s;ure as one who <HI>cannot</HI> read? He may, and he often does make a bad u&s;e of his reading, but I doubt he would have been as bad without it. And the hours &s;pent in learning to read will always have been among the mo&s;t harmle&s;s ones of his life."</P>
<P>"Well madam," &s;aid the farmer, "if you do not think that religion will &s;poil my young &s;ervants,
<PB N="13" REF="12">I do not care if you do put me down for half a guinea. What has farmer Dob&s;on given?" "Half a guinea," &s;aid Mrs. Jones. "Well," cried the far|mer, "it &s;hall never be &s;aid I did not give more than he, who is only a renter. Dob&s;on give half a guinea? Why, he wears his coat as thread bare as a labourer. "Perhaps," replied Mrs. Jones, "that is one rea&s;on why he gives &s;o much." Well, put me down a guinea," cried the farmer. "As &s;carce as guineas are ju&s;t now, I'll never be put upon the &s;ame footing with Dob&s;on neither." "Yes, and you mu&s;t exert your&s;elf be&s;ides in in&s;i&s;ting that your workmen &s;end their children, and often look into the &s;chool your&s;elf to &s;ee if they are there, and reward or di&s;courage them accordingly," added Mrs. Jones as &s;he took her leave. The farmer in|&s;i&s;ted in waiting on her to the door. When they got into the yard, they &s;pied Mr. Simp&s;on, who was &s;tanding near a little group of females, con&s;i&s;ting of the farmer's two young daughters, and a couple of ro&s;y dairy maids, an old blind fiddler, and a wo|man who led him. The woman had laid a ba&s;ket on the ground, out of which &s;he was dealing &s;ome &s;ongs to the girls who were kneeling round it, and eagerly picking out &s;uch who&s;e titles &s;uited their ta&s;tes. On &s;eeing the clergyman come up, the fiddler's companion (for I am &s;orry to &s;ay &s;he was not his wife) pu&s;hed &s;ome of the &s;ongs to the bottom of the ba&s;ket, turned round to the com|pany, and in a whining tone, a&s;ked "if they would plea&s;e to buy a godly book." Mr. Simp&s;on &s;aw through the hypocri&s;y at once, and in&s;tead of mak|ing any an&s;wer, took out of one of the girl's hands, a &s;ong which the woman had not been able to &s;natch away. He was &s;hocked and grieved to &s;ee that
<PB N="14" REF="13">the&s;e young girls were about to read, to &s;ing, and to learn by heart &s;uch ribaldry, as he was a&s;hamed even to ca&s;t his eyes on. He turned about to the girl and gravely, but mildly &s;aid, "young woman, what do you think &s;hould be done to a per&s;on who &s;hould be found carrying a box of poi&s;on round the country, and leaving a little at every hou&s;e?" The girls all agreed that &s;uch a per&s;on ought to be hanged;" "that he &s;hould," &s;aid the farmer, "if I was upon the jury." The fiddler and his woman were of the &s;ame opinion, declaring <HI>they</HI> would not do &s;uch a wicked thing for the world, for if they were poor they were hone&s;t. Mr. Simp&s;on turning to the other girl, &s;aid, "which is of mo&s;t value the &s;oul or the body?" "The &s;oul &s;ir," &s;aid the girl. "Why &s;o?" &s;aid he, "becau&s;e &s;ir, I have heard you &s;ay in the pulpit the &s;oul is to la&s;t for ever." Then cried Mr. Simp&s;on in a &s;tern voice, turning to the fiddler's woman, "are not you a&s;hamed to &s;ell poi&s;on for that part which is to la&s;t for ever? poi&s;on for the &s;oul?" "Poi&s;on!" &s;aid the terrified girl throwing down the book, and &s;huddering as people do who are afraid they have touched &s;ome|thing infectious. "Poi&s;on!" echoed the farmer's daughters, recollecting with horror the rat&s;bane which Lion the old hou&s;e dog had got at the day before, and after eating which &s;he had &s;een him drop down dead in convul&s;ions. "Yes," &s;aid Mr. Simp&s;on to the woman, "I do again repeat, the &s;ouls of the&s;e innocent girls will be poi&s;oned and may be eternally ruined by this vile tra&s;h which you carry about."</P>
<P>"I now &s;ee," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, to the farmer, "the rea&s;on why you think learning to read does more harm than good. It is indeed far better that
<PB N="15" REF="14">they &s;hould never know how to tell a letter, unle&s;s you keep &s;uch tra&s;h as this out of their way, and provide them with what is good or what is harm|le&s;s. Still this is not the fault of reading, but the abu&s;e of it. Wine is &s;till a good cordial, though it is too often abu&s;ed to the purpo&s;e of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The farmer &s;aid that neither of his maids could read their horn book, though he owned he often heard them &s;inging that &s;ong which the par&s;on had thought &s;o bad, but for his part it made him as merry as a nightingale.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "as a proof that it is not merely being able to read which does the mi&s;chief, I have often heard as I have been cro&s;&s;ing a hay|field, young girls &s;inging &s;uch indecent ribaldry as has driven me out of the field, though I well knew they could not read a line of what they were &s;ing|ing, but had caught it from others. So you &s;ee you may as well &s;ay the memory is a wicked talent becau&s;e &s;ome people mi&s;apply it, as to &s;ay that read|ing is dangerous, becau&s;e &s;ome folks abu&s;e it."</P>
<P>While they were talking, the fiddler and his wo|man were trying to &s;teal away, but Mr. Simp&s;on &s;topped them and &s;aid, "woman I &s;hall have &s;ome farther talk with you. I am a magi&s;trate as well as a mini&s;ter, and if I know it, I will no more al|low a wicked book to be &s;old in my pari&s;h than a do&s;e of poi&s;on." The girls threw away all their &s;ongs, thanked Mr. Wil&s;on, begged Mrs. Jones would take them into her &s;chool after they had done milking in the evenings, that they might learn to read only what was proper. They promi&s;ed they would never more deal with any but &s;ober hone&s;t hawkers, &s;uch as &s;ell good little books, Chri&s;tmas carrols, and harmle&s;s &s;ongs, and de&s;ired the fiddler's woman never to call there again.</P>

This little incident afterwards confirmed Mrs. Jones in a plan &s;he had before &s;ome thoughts of putting in practice. This was, after her &s;chool had been e&s;tabli&s;hed a few months, to invite all the well-di&s;po&s;ed grown-up youth of the pari&s;h to meet her at the &s;chool an hour or two on a Sunday even|ing, after the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the dairy and of &s;erving the cattle was over. Both Mrs. Jones and her agent had the talent of making this time pa&s;s &s;o agreeably by their manner of explaining &s;crip|ture, and of impre&s;&s;ing the heart by &s;erious and affectionate di&s;cour&s;e, that in a &s;hort time the even|ing &s;chool was nearly filled with a &s;econd company after the younger ones were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. In time, not only the &s;ervants, but the &s;ons and daughters of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial people in the pari&s;h attended. At length many of the parents, plea&s;ed with the im|provement &s;o vi&s;ible in the young people, got a habit of dropping in, that they might learn how to in&s;truct their own families. And it was ob&s;erved that as the &s;chool filled, not only the fives-court and public-hou&s;e were thinned, but even Sunday go&s;&s;iping and tea-vi&s;iting declined. Even Farmer Ho&s;kins, who was at fir&s;t angry with his maids for learning of tho&s;e <HI>merry</HI> &s;ongs (as he called them) was &s;o plea&s;ed by the manner in which the p&s;alms were &s;ung at the &s;chool, that he promi&s;ed Mrs. Jones to make her a pre&s;ent of half a &s;heep towards her fir&s;t May-day fea&s;t. Of this fea&s;t &s;ome account &s;hall be given hereafter, and the reader may expect &s;ome further account of the Sunday School next month in the Hi&s;tory of He&s;ter Wilmot.</P>
