<P>What, <HI>Ned Gilbert,</HI> up and garter'd before Eleven! Why, what in the name of the Lark, makes you &s;uch an early Ri&s;er? Perhaps bad Wine and wor&s;e Company had Charms &s;ufficient to rival your Pillow, and keep you up all Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gilb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o, upon my Honour. I went &s;oberly to Re&s;t at Twelve; but my Pillow and I never agreed wor&s;e: There was no Part of it cou'd plea&s;e me. But, when I account for our Quarrel, you will cer|tainly indulge in a hearty Laugh.

<P>Never was Man &s;o chang'd. I drew <HI>Townly</HI> a&s;ide, made a &s;hort Inquiry into her Family and Character; and, finding both unexceptionable, I made a formal Declaration of an honourable Pa&s;&s;ion; which the dear Girl receiv'd in a mo&s;t ea&s;y, open, becoming Manner.</P>

<P>Well, this is as &s;trange a Metamorpho&s;is as any in <HI>Ovid!</HI> but I believe it is only the Fore-runner of another. A Month's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;ired Ob|ject, will convince him, however ea&s;ily trapp'd, he is not long to be caged. Love, quotha! he has been as often in love, as he calls it, as I have been at &s;hort Commons; and has changed his Mind much oftener, than I my Livery. I thought &s;omething was gathering in the Wind when I let him in la&s;t Night. He was very eager to get to Bed too, which is never the Ca&s;e, but when his Heart's full or his Pur&s;e empty. I fore&s;ee a World of Difficulty in this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. So much the better&mdash;for, as he has but few Friends in Town, I mu&s;t needs be a Party in the Plot&mdash;and when once I am deeply engag'd in the Secret&mdash;if I don't get well paid for keeping it, why then&mdash;But hold!

<P>My Father's Bu&s;ine&s;s was as important as di&s;a|greeable.
