<HEAD>AN IMPOSSIBLE THING. A <HI>TALE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_TO thee, Dear <HI>Dick,</HI> this Tale I &s;end,</L>
<L>Both as a Critick and a Friend.</L>
<L>I tell it with &s;ome Variation</L>
<L>(Not altogether a Tran&s;lation)</L>
<L>From <HI>La Fontaine;</HI> an Author, <HI>Dick,</HI></L>
<L>Who&s;e Mu&s;e would touch thee to the quick.</L>
<L>The Subject is of that &s;ame kind</L>
<L>To which thy Heart &s;eems mo&s;t inclin'd:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">
How Ver&s;e may alter it, God knows,</L>
<L>Thou lov'&s;t it well, I'm &s;ure, in Pro&s;e,</L>
<L>So, without Preface, or Pretence,</L>
<L>To hold thee longer in Su&s;pence,</L>
<L>I &s;hall proceed, as I am able,</L>
<L>To the Recital of my Fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A <HI>Goblin</HI> of the merry Kind,</L>
<L>More black of Hue, than cur&s;t of Mind,</L>
<L>To help a Lover in Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Contriv'd a Charm with &s;uch Succe&s;s;</L>
<L>That in &s;hort Space the cruel Dame</L>
<L>Relented, and return'd his Flame.</L>
<L>The Dargain made betwixt 'em both,</L>
<L>Was bound by Honour and by Oath:</L>
<L>The Lover laid down his Salvation,</L>
<L>And <HI>Satan</HI> &s;tak'd his Reputation.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">
The Latter promis'd on his Part</L>
<L>(To &s;erve his Friend and &s;hew his Art,)</L>
<L>That Madam &s;hou'd by twelve a Clock,</L>
<L>Tho' hitherto as hard as Rock,</L>
<L>Become as gentle as a Glove,</L>
<L>And ki&s;s and coo like any Dove.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, the Woman &s;hould be his,</L>
<L>That is, upon Condition&mdash;<HI>Viz;</HI></L>
<L>That He, the Lover, after ta&s;ting</L>
<L>What one wou'd wi&s;h were everla&s;ting;</L>
<L>Should, in Return for &s;uch Enjoyment,</L>
<L>Supply the Fiend with fre&s;h Employment:</L>
<L>That's all, quoth <HI>Pug;</HI> my poor Reque&s;t</L>
<L>Is, only never to have Re&s;t;</L>
<L>You thought, 'tis like, with Rea&s;on too,</L>
<L>That I &s;hould have been &s;erv'd, not You:</L>
<L>But what? upon my Friend impo&s;e!</L>
<L>No&mdash;tho' a Devil, none of tho&s;e.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">
Your Bu&s;ine&s;s then, pray under&s;tand me,</L>
<L>Is nothing more but to Command me.</L>
<L>Of one thing only let me warn ye,</L>
<L>Which &s;omewhat nearly may concern ye:</L>
<L>As &s;oon as e'er one Work is done,</L>
<L>Strait name a new one; and &s;o on;</L>
<L>Let each to other quick &s;ucceed,</L>
<L>Or el&s;e&mdash;you know how 'tis agreed&mdash;</L>
<L>For if thro' any Hums or Haws</L>
<L>There haps an intervening Pau&s;e,</L>
<L>In which, for Want of fre&s;h Commands,</L>
<L>Your Slave ob&s;equious, Idle &s;tands,</L>
<L>Nor Soul nor Body ever more</L>
<L>Shall &s;erve the Nymph whom you adore;</L>
<L>But both be laid at <HI>Satan</HI>'s Feet,</L>
<L>To be di&s;pos'd as he thinks meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At once the Lover all approves:</L>
<L>For who can he&s;itate that loves?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">
And thus he argues in his Thought:</L>
<L>Why, after all, I venture nought;</L>
<L>What My&s;tery is in Commanding?</L>
<L>Does that require Much Under&s;tanding?</L>
<L>Indeed, wer't my Part to Obey,</L>
<L>He'd go the better of the Lay:</L>
<L>But he mu&s;t do what I think fit&mdash;</L>
<L>P&s;haw, p&s;haw, young <HI>Belzebub</HI> is bit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus pleas'd in Mind, he calls a Chair;</L>
<L>Adju&s;ts, and combs, and courts the Fair:</L>
<L>The Spell takes Place, and all goes right,</L>
<L>And happy he, employs the Night</L>
<L>In &s;weet Embraces, balmy Ki&s;&s;es;</L>
<L>And riots in the Bli&s;s of Bli&s;&s;es.</L>
<L>O Joy, cry'd he, that ha&s;t no Equal!</L>
<L>But hold&mdash;no Raptures&mdash;mark the Sequel.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">
For now, when near the Morning's Dawn,</L>
<L>The Youth began as 'twere to yawn;</L>
<L>His Eyes a &s;ilky Slumber &s;eiz'd,</L>
<L>Or would have done, if <HI>Pug</HI> had pleas'd:</L>
<L>But that officious <HI>Demon,</HI> near,</L>
<L>Now buzz'd for Bu&s;ine&s;s in his <HI>Ear;</HI></L>
<L>In Ha&s;te, he names a thou&s;and Things:</L>
<L>The <HI>Goblin</HI> plys his wicker Wings,</L>
<L>And in a Trice returns to ask</L>
<L>Another and another Task.</L>
<L>Now, Palaces are built and Tow'rs,</L>
<L>The Work of Ages in few Hours.</L>
<L>Then, Storms are in an In&s;tant rais'd,</L>
<L>Which the next Moment are appeas'd.</L>
<L>Now Show'rs of Gold and Gems are rain'd,</L>
<L>As if each <HI>India</HI> had been drain'd:</L>
<L>And He, in one a&s;toni&s;h'd View,</L>
<L>Sees both <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">
The&s;e Things, and &s;tranger Things than the&s;e,</L>
<L>Were done with equal Speed and Ea&s;e.</L>
<L>And now to <HI>Rome</HI> poor <HI>Pug</HI> he'll &s;end:</L>
<L>And <HI>Pug</HI> &s;oon reach'd his Journey's End.</L>
<L>And &s;oon return'd with &s;uch a Pack</L>
<L>Of Bulls and Pardons at his Back,</L>
<L>That now, the Squire (who had &s;ome Hope</L>
<L>In holy Water and the Pope,)</L>
<L>Was out of Heart, and at a Stand</L>
<L>What next to wi&s;h, and what command;</L>
<L>Invention flags, his Brain grows muddy,</L>
<L>And black De&s;pair &s;ucceeds brown Study.</L>
<L>In this Di&s;tre&s;s the woful Youth</L>
<L>Acquaints the Nymph with all the Truth,</L>
<L>Begging her Coun&s;el, for who&s;e Sake</L>
<L>Both Soul and Body were at Stake.</L>
<L>And is this all? replys the Fair;</L>
<L>Let me alone to cure this Care.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10">
When next your <HI>Demon</HI> &s;hall appear,</L>
<L>Pray give him&mdash;look, what I hold here.</L>
<L>And bid him labour, &s;oon or late,</L>
<L>To lay the&s;e Ringlets lank and &s;trait.</L>
<L>Then, &s;omething &s;carcely to be &s;een,</L>
<L>Her Finger and her Thumb between</L>
<L>She held, and &s;weetly &s;miling, cry'd,</L>
<L>Your <HI>Goblin</HI>'s Skill &s;hall now be try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She &s;aid; and gave&mdash;what &s;hall I call</L>
<L>That Thing &s;o &s;hining, cri&s;p and &s;mall,</L>
<L>Which round his Finger &s;trove to twine?</L>
<L>A Tendril of the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Vine?</L>
<L>Or Sprig from <HI>Cytherea</HI>'s Grove;</L>
<L>Shade of the Labyrinth of Love!</L>
<L>With Awe, he now takes from her Hand</L>
<L>That Fleece-like Flow'r of fairy Land:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11">
Le&s;s precious, whilom, was the Fleece</L>
<L>Which drew the <HI>Argonauts</HI> from <HI>Greece;</HI></L>
<L>Or that, which modern Ages &s;ee</L>
<L>The Spur and Prize of Chivalry,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Curls of kindred Texture, grace</L>
<L>Heroes and Kings of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Spark prepar'd, and <HI>Pug</HI> at Hand,</L>
<L>He i&s;&s;ues, thus, his &s;trict Command.</L>
<L>This Line, thus Curve and thus Orbicular,</L>
<L>Render direct, and perpendicular;</L>
<L>But &s;o direct, that in no &s;ort</L>
<L>It ever may in Rings retort.</L>
<L>See me no more 'till this be done:</L>
<L>Hence, to thy Task&mdash;avaunt, be gone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away the Fiend like Lightning flys,</L>
<L>And all his Wit to Work applys:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12">
Anvils and Pre&s;&s;es he employs,</L>
<L>And dins whole Hell with hamm'ring Noi&s;e.</L>
<L>In vain: he to no Terms can bring</L>
<L>One Twire of that reluctant Thing;</L>
<L>Th' ela&s;tic Fibre mocks his Pains,</L>
<L>And it's fir&s;t &s;piral Form retains.</L>
<L>New Stratagems the Sprite co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ves,</L>
<L>And down the Depths of Sea he dives:</L>
<L>This Sprunt its Pertne&s;s &s;ure will lo&s;e</L>
<L>When laid (&s;aid he) to &s;oak in Ooze.</L>
<L>Poor fooli&s;h Fiend! he little knew</L>
<L>Whence <HI>Venus</HI> and her Garden grew.</L>
<L>Old Ocean, with paternal Waves</L>
<L>The Child of his own Bed receives;</L>
<L>Which oft as dipt new Force exerts,</L>
<L>And in more vig'rous Curls reverts.</L>
<L>So, when to Earth, <HI>Alcides</HI> flung</L>
<L>The huge <HI>Ant&euml;us,</HI> whence he &s;prung,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13">
From ev'ry Fall fre&s;h Strength he gain'd,</L>
<L>And with new Life the Fight maintain'd.</L>

<L>The bafled <HI>Go&s;lin</HI> grows perplex'd,</L>
<L>Nor knows what Sleight to practi&s;e next:</L>
<L>The more he trys, the more he fails;</L>
<L>Nor Charm, nor Art, nor Force avails.</L>
<L>But all concur his Shame to &s;how,</L>
<L>And more exa&s;perate the Foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now he pen&s;ive turns and &s;ad,</L>
<L>And looks like melancholick mad.</L>
<L>He rolls his Eyes now off, now on</L>
<L>That wonderful <HI>Phenomenon.</HI></L>
<L>Sometimes he twi&s;ts and twirls it round,</L>
<L>Then, pau&s;ing, meditates profound:</L>
<L>No End he &s;ees of his Surprize,</L>
<L>Nor what it &s;hould be can devi&s;e:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="14">
For never yet was Wooll or Feather,</L>

<L>'Tis &s;aid, he blu&s;h'd; 'tis &s;ure, he &s;wore</L>
<L>Not all the Wiles that Hell could hatch</L>
<L>Could conquer that SUPERB MUSTACH.</L>
<L>Defeated thus, thus di&s;content,</L>
<L>Back to the Man the <HI>Demon</HI> went:</L>
<L>I grant, quoth he, our Contract null,</L>
<L>And give you a Di&s;charge in full.</L>
