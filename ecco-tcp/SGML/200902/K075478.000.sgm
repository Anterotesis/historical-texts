<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PRINCIPLES of religion and le&s;&s;ons of morality, are the fir&s;t maxims that &s;hould be in&s;tilled into the minds of youth; but the&s;e truths being naturally dry and un|entertaining to playful minds, very much in|di&s;po&s;e them for their reception. This con&s;i|deration occa&s;ioned writers to introduce mo|rality under a ma&s;k, and teach it in the form of fables and a variety of entertaining &s;to|ries; others have laboured to communicate this knowledge, by le&s;&s;ons drawn from life, or living characters; but it needs an age to acquire &s;uch knowledge, and a man will be going out of the world before he becomes ac|quainted with it. To remedy this defect, pictures of human life have been introduced upon the &s;tage, and he, who has made any ob&s;ervation, mu&s;t admit, that, &s;ince our the|atres have been morally &s;upported, and ex|tended to almo&s;t every town, our ideas have been opened, and our manners very much improved; they having held up Virtue in
<PB N="vi" REF="6">e&s;teem, and laughed Vice almo&s;t out of coun|tenance.</P>
<P>The Vignette in the title-page, expre&s;&s;es this fully. Wi&s;dom holding up a mirror to Folly, and &s;hewing him to him&s;elf&mdash;<HI>Know thy&s;elf</HI> is a le&s;&s;on of the fir&s;t importance, and ought to be imprinted on the mind of every one; for he who knows him&s;elf, will be careful to correct his failings, and im|prove his virtues.</P>
<P>Having, &s;ome years &s;ince, de&s;canted on the work of Mr. <HI>Hogarth,</HI> and moralized his pieces, and finding them in the hands of a variety of young per&s;on, who would not otherwi&s;e have taken up a book of improve|ment, I was led to think, that, as every le&s;&s;on of religious and worldly knowledge is to be met with in our collection of Engli&s;h Proverbs, to exemplify the&s;e Proverbs, would almo&s;t an&s;wer a &s;imilar purpo&s;e; and having met with an arti&s;t, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. John Bewick.</NOTE> who knew how to illu&s;trate the follies and vices of mankind, better than mo&s;t men, I have pro|fited by his abilities; and flatter my&s;elf the Proverbs thus introduced to the notice of young minds, will have a much better ef|fect, and make a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="vii" REF="7">than any dull reading, or &s;chola&s;tic admo|nition whatever. Every eye is able to col|lect the meaning of a picture, and the idea &s;ugge&s;ted by it, is caught at a glance; but, to receive impre&s;&s;ions from books, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary to read, but to reflect; and I very much doubt, whether the &s;ermons of a <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> ever preached &s;o effectually, as the paintings of a <HI>Hogarth.</HI> The art of painting, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Knox,</HI> in his improving E&s;&s;ays, is one of tho&s;e innocent and delightful means of plea&s;ure, which Providence has kindly af|forded, to brighten the pro&s;pects of human life. Under due re&s;trictions and with proper direction, it may be rendered &s;omething more than an elegant mode of plea&s;ing the eye and the imagination: it may become a very powerful auxiliary to virtue.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e I have u&s;ed it; I have made the attempt with a few of our Proverbs, and mean to follow them with more; and, as I wi&s;h them to &s;ucceed the u&s;e of fables, have written them, though in an ea&s;y &s;tile, in language, that, whil&s;t I mend the heart, I may improve the mind. To bring youth for|ward, after then years of age, children &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed as grown per&s;ons; for, treating
<PB N="viii" REF="8">them as children, tends only to di&s;courage them. If they are, at any time, at a lo&s;s; their little, inqui&s;itive minds will make them a&s;k an explanation, and &s;uch explanation will be a new and plea&s;ing di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on the&s;e Proverbs, I have endeavoured to be explicit, yet conci&s;e; that, though anxious to inform, I may not tire; and as the illu&s;tration of one Proverb, will be continued under its relative, or a &s;imilar one, every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;ubject will be &s;aid; but apparently under a new head, and &s;ome new intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>The prints, though cut in wood, are &s;o well de&s;igned, and the characters &s;o well drawn, that per&s;ons of ta&s;te may examine them with plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>A good Beginning makes a good End.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THIS Proverb is not &s;o general, in its views, as &s;ome, being rather limited in its meaning. It does not imply, that a piece of work, well be|gun, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be well fini&s;hed; though the likelie&s;t me|thod of completing it to your wi&s;h, is to begin it &s;o; and a good beginning is a favourable index of a good end; but the maxim has a moral ten|dency, directing its views to mankind who rarely,
<PB N="2" REF="10">in fact, practi&s;e in manhood the principles they in|bibe in their youth. <HI>Ju&s;t as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.</HI> The youth, educated, and brought up in the paths of virtue, &s;eldom &s;trays. It begets a love and veneration for tho&s;e paths, which ma|ture years &s;erve only to increa&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>Children, like tender oziers, take the bow,</L>
<L>And as they fir&s;t are fa&s;hion'd, always grow.</L></Q>
<P>If, therefore, the &s;eeds of religion and honor are &s;own in youth, they will bring forth the fruits of temporal happine&s;s in riper life.&mdash; "Train up a child," &s;ays Solomon, "in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not de|part from it."&mdash;Thus will <HI>a good Beginning make a good End.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, in the &s;cene before us, the calmne&s;s and &s;erenity with which the good man meets his end. Death approaches him at his window; &s;hews him that his gla&s;s is run, and calls him to futurity. Far from &s;hrinking at the awful &s;ummons&mdash;far from &s;huddering at that call, which thou&s;ands dread, he receives the notice with open arms; not merely re|joicing to be relea&s;ed from the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, but eager to meet his Redeemer, which the holy &s;crip|tures have taught him to expect, and with an anxi|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="11">to be with Chri&s;t; which, in the hour of death, can only flow from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a well-&s;pent life. He had been well educated&mdash;his <HI>begin|ning</HI> was good&mdash;&s;o was his <HI>end.</HI> Death is armed with no terrors for him. He boldly throws a&s;ide the curtain, and &s;tretches forth his arms to em|brace him. Thus doth the evening of life crown the day.</P>
<P>By the pious precepts, and the virtuous exam|ple of an indulgent parent, the fair Laura profits. See her, on her knees, offering her prayers to the throne of Heaven, and be&s;eeching the gracious Au|thor of her being to enable her to live as has her father, and that "her latter end may be like his." His care had thrown within her tender mind a light upon the go&s;pel, of which the bible before her, and the burning taper are types, and rai&s;es her eyes to her Redeemer on the cro&s;s, not as to an idol, but as a <HI>memento</HI> that he died for all. Methinks I hear the good man thus addre&s;&s;ing her: "See," &s;ays he, laying his &s;pectacles near the &s;criptures be&s;ide him. "See, my Laura, whence I have derived the happine&s;s I now enjoy,&mdash;The &s;acred truths in this book have in&s;pired me with a love for virtue. A well-&s;pent life is the be&s;t com|fort of old age.&mdash;It di&s;arms death of all its terrors, and enables us to meet it without reluctance.&mdash;This
<PB N="4" REF="12">is the bock that tells us "we &s;hall never die"; but that, if our Beginning is good, and we &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue early, our End will be good al&s;o, and, after this life, we &s;hall reap the fruit of eter|nal happine&s;s in the next. We &s;hall be able, on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, to welcome Death, with extend|ed arms, to view with compo&s;ure the la&s;t of our &s;and running, and exclaim with the good man be|fore us&mdash;"O Death! <HI>where</HI> is thy &s;ting?"</P>
<P>On the contrary&mdash;If, in early life, we a&s;&s;ociate with bad company; if we indulge our wi&s;hes, gra|tify our pa&s;&s;ions, and run heedle&s;s and headlong into every vice, we may enjoy a tran&s;itory happi|ne&s;s, a little plea&s;ure for awhile; but when Death &s;hall come, as, &s;ooner or later, it is &s;ure to do, we &s;hall tremble at its approach, &s;hudder at its gha&s;t|ly vi&s;age, draw the curtain round us, &s;hriek at the &s;ight of it's dart, and call upon "the mountains to fall on us and to cover us."</P>
<P>If then we would meet Death without horror, let us lead a good life: if our con&s;cience does not condemn us, we &s;hall have nothing to dread; for, as a bad Beginning makes a bad End, &s;o <HI>"A good Beginning makes a good End."</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Worth of a Thing is be&s;t known by its Want.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THE French have a Proverb &s;imilar to this. "The cow knows not what her tail is worth till &s;he hath lo&s;t it," as it &s;erves to whi&s;k the flies from her; teaching us not to di&s;regard a thing, becau&s;e we have no pre&s;ent u&s;e for it, be it, in it's own nature, ever &s;o in&s;ignificant. All things are equally important in their way; and there is no
<PB N="6" REF="14">trifle, be it of what kind it will, but may, at times, be converted to &s;ome good purpo&s;e. A prudent man, therefore, will never make wa&s;te of any thing he has, but u&s;e it di&s;creetly, and ble&s;s Providence for all it's gifts. The painter has &s;hewn us the force of this truth in the want of water. A hot, &s;corching &s;ea&s;on has dried up a well, who&s;e water, not being the &s;weete&s;t in the neighbourhood, was di&s;regarded; but, at the &s;ame time was never known to dry away. When every other &s;pring had &s;ailed, the people flocked to this, &s;aying, "Bad water was better than none," and they mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the &s;tinking well at la&s;t. Here then they flocked, in a &s;ultry, parching day, both men and animals; but how great was their di&s;ap|pointment at finding this dry al&s;o, and how mani|fe&s;t is their chagrin painted in their countenances! Even &s;tinking water would have now been accepta|ble; but the&s;e thoughtle&s;s people are made to feel the want of it.</P>
<P>Learn then, ye incon&s;iderate of the age, from the moral of this &s;tory, not to &s;purn at the good offices of tho&s;e below you; nor become thankle&s;s in the hour of pro&s;perity. It may happen that your re&s;ources may be dried up, and that you may be in want of tho&s;e very &s;ervices you now de&s;pi&s;e. Friends are not ea&s;ily acquired; when a man,
<PB N="7" REF="15">therefore, fortunately <HI>has</HI> friends, let him "&s;hew him&s;elf friendly;" and endeavour to keep them. There is no friend &s;o poor, but may have it in his power to be of u&s;e to us in the cour&s;e of life, and his &s;ervices, therefore, &s;hould never be contemned.</P>
<P>This Proverb may al&s;o be a le&s;&s;on to us, not to wa&s;te the good things of this life, which Heaven has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s us with, under an idea that we may never want them. If we have more than we want, we &s;hould be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who have le&s;s. Here we may lay it up in &s;tore; for "what we give to the poor, we lend to the Lord," and &s;hall afterwards find in our own che&s;t. We are not, however, to be lavi&s;h in our charity, but act with wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion; laying &s;omething by again&s;t an evil day. Many are the turns and ebbs in a man's fortune; and, though he is rich to-day, he may be poor to-morrow. And as he that wa&s;tes will want, let us be careful not to bring our&s;elves into &s;uch a &s;ituation; for, though the rich have many friends, the poor have &s;eldom any: but the&s;e friends of the rich are little el&s;e than butter-flies, that flutter round a man's good fortune, as a moth round the flame of a candle, but who will de|&s;ert him when di&s;tre&s;s comes upon him, and fall from him like withered leaves at the approach of winter.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">We are here taught likewi&s;e, in another &s;en&s;e, to hu&s;band our time, and never put off that till to|morrow which can be done to-day. For that to|morrow may never come; we may be taken out of the world when we lea&s;t expect it; and, what we propo&s;e to do, may thus never be accompli&s;hed. If we are, then, to make provi&s;ion for our fami|lies, let us do it, whil&s;t we have it in our power; and, if we are to make provi&s;ion for our&s;elves, let us not defer it till it is too late. By provi&s;ion for our&s;elves, I mean making our peace with Hea|ven, and laying up riches, "where neither moth nor ru&s;t doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and &s;teal." There is no man &s;o virtuous, but &s;tands in need of repentance; and, if he is wi&s;e, he will repent of his &s;ins whil&s;t he is enabled to do it; and not wa&s;te tho&s;e precious hours in a life of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation, which he can employ to more nobler purpo&s;es. The time he now thinks &s;o little of, he may one day want, and then what would he give to live it over again? be wi&s;e then, and circum&s;pect; make the mo&s;t of your pre&s;ent hours; be thankful for every thing you have; place your reliance on God, who&s;e &s;prings are never dry; turn every thing within your reach to the be&s;t advantage; don't con&s;ider even the &s;malle&s;t thing as below your notice; for be a&s;&s;ured its <HI>Worth is be&s;t known by its Want.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Experience is the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Fools.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THERE are many per&s;ons in the world who de&s;pi&s;e admonition, and cannot be brought to believe things wrong, till they have found them &s;o by experience; and often buy this experience at a dear rate. This makes even fools wi&s;e; and hence the Proverb <HI>Experience is the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Fools.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18">In vain did the inventor of gun-powder perceive its &s;trength in blowing up large pieces of rock. He doubted it's power, until he had placed him|&s;elf upon a large &s;tone over &s;ome: but his experi|ence was fatal to him, having lo&s;t his life upon the occa&s;ion. Po&s;terity, however, have been benefited by this ra&s;h act; and fools have, by that experi|ment been made wi&s;e. It would be well for us all, if, as Lillo &s;ays, "we learnt to be wi&s;e by others harm!"</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any &s;ituation, any circum&s;tance in life, but, if we look round upon it, we may profit by the experience of others. 'Tis this which the Proverb alludes to; not to wait for con|viction, till we are taught it by experience; fools can do no more, and &s;uch a le&s;&s;on may be attended with bad con&s;equences. This was the ca&s;e with the inventor of gun-powder we have mentioned.

<P>In vain did his parents advi&s;e him to de&s;i&s;t; in vain did they point out the danger of engaging ra&s;hly with a hive of bees: experience has now made him wi&s;e; and the &s;mart he feels, will tell him the next time he approaches a bee-hive, to be more upon his guard. The hive is a &s;ignificant emblem of indu&s;try, it being the &s;tore-hou&s;e, where the bees lay up their provi&s;ion for the winter; and the props, under the hive, are meant to &s;hew that indu&s;try will never want &s;upport: nor is even the &s;tick without it's moral; pointing &s;traight to the boy that is running off, it tells us, that Indu&s;try is the &s;traight line to retirement, for <HI>the di|ligent man maketh rich.</HI>&mdash;Prudent lad, he has benefited by the experience of his compa|nion, and has e&s;caped the harm: knowing now that he <HI>cannot gather ro&s;es without thorns,</HI> or honey without the ri&s;k of being &s;tung&mdash;"I will pro|vide my&s;elf," cries he, "as well as I can, again&s;t the danger, and then I'll try."</P>

<P>THE Devil is the Enemy of mankind, and the Parent of Vice; and whatever is done by his in&s;tigation, cannot thrive; for God pro&s;pers not the evil doer. Money, hone&s;tly earned, and procured with honour, will do a man credit, and be the means of his getting more; but ill-gotten wealth never does the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or any good. When
<PB N="14" REF="22">men know the difficulty of getting money, they are naturally careful of it, and are &s;eldom &s;een to lavi&s;h it away; but tho&s;e who get it by fraud, by oppre&s;&s;ion, or extortion, &s;eldom put any value on it, and wa&s;te it in the &s;ame vicious way in which they got it,&mdash;<HI>Light come, light go.</HI>&mdash;The puni&s;hment inflicted by Heaven on ill-gotten wealth, is that natural wa&s;te of it which gave ri&s;e to this Proverb; and per&s;ons have lived to &s;ee, that fortunes, ama&s;&s;ed by unfair dealing, by cards, by gambling, by op|pre&s;&s;ion, and extortion, when left to the next heir, have been di&s;&s;ipated in riot and debauchery: where|as tho&s;e which are hone&s;tly and honourably acquired, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a family for many generations. God has been plea&s;ed to pro&s;per the undertakings of &s;uch a hou&s;e, and they have been the pride of their relations, and the country round them.</P>
<P>Riches are, undoubtedly, enviable; but they cannot be enjoyed with comfort, and certainly lo&s;e that ze&s;t, that naturally attends them, when they are acquired with credit.&mdash;<HI>Sweet is the bread we earn.</HI>&mdash;And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e we eat it in a &s;pirit of independence; con&s;cious that we have hone&s;tly ob|tained it, are beholden only to our own indu&s;try for it; and that we have not procured it by oppre&s;&s;ing the unfortunate, or extorting it from the igno|rant; by grinding the face of the poor; or ac|quiring
<PB N="15" REF="23">it at the expence of a family's happine&s;s.&mdash; A man had better be poor, than rich by unfair means.&mdash;Poverty is no way di&s;honourable, if the poor man is at the &s;ame time virtuous; for virtu|ous poverty is, in the e&s;timation of all wi&s;e and good men, far more re&s;pectable than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ill-gotten wealth. As a competency, or &s;uf|ficiency of money to procure the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life is, however, what all men are ju&s;|tifiable in looking for, let us do it by our own in|du&s;try, and rendering our&s;elves &s;erviceable to man|kind; for, "the Diligent hand God maketh rich." Let that indu&s;try be hone&s;t and prai&s;e-worthy, &s;uch as will bear an enquiry into; and, depend on it, wealth &s;o acquired, will always be found the mo&s;t la&s;ting: for the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, "I have been young, and now am old, yet &s;aw I never the righteous for|&s;aken, or his &s;eed begging their bread." What &s;atisfaction can a man have in &s;uch property as he knows he has cheated his neighbour of?&mdash;His con|&s;cience will be ever flinging his iniquity in his face; be the wor&s;t of upbraiders, and deprive him of that real comfort and enjoyment, which the ho|nourable acqui&s;ition of wealth brings with it.</P>
<P>Look at the &s;cene before us&mdash;a young gentle|man di&s;&s;ipating his fortune in company with bad women and gamblers; where he is plundered, as the painter &s;uppo&s;es, of that fortune his ance&s;tor
<PB N="16" REF="24">acquired by fraud. As the Devil was the in&s;tiga|tion of &s;uch an acqui&s;ition, he is here &s;hewn to be the cau&s;e of its di&s;&s;ipation; for nothing but the De|vil, the parent of wickedne&s;s, could induce a wo|man, the lovelie&s;t of the human race, &s;o far to di&s;|honour her&s;elf, as to a&s;&s;ociate with the abandoned, and become their partners in vice.</P>
<P>Rogues, they &s;ay, are generally true to each other; but it does not appear to be the ca&s;e here, for &s;he is picking the pocket of one of her a&s;&s;o|ciates. It is folly indeed to expect any degree of hone&s;ty in tho&s;e who have not the principle; for nature will &s;hew it&s;elf; and tho&s;e who are bred up in vice, &s;eldom depart from it.</P>
<P>The further effects of Gambling are here depict|ed. From the countenance of him with the empty pur&s;e, we learn the di&s;traction of his mind.&mdash;Eager to win, and happening to lo&s;e, he lo&s;es his temper and his patience, and with the&s;e his happine&s;s.&mdash; For, when a man lo&s;es more money than he can afford, it is &s;ure to make him wretched.&mdash;The win|ner may &s;mile, but the lo&s;er is mi&s;erable.&mdash;Why then pur&s;ue &s;uch means, as &s;tand a chance to di&s;tre&s;s os?&mdash;It mu&s;t be infatuation.

<P>OF all kinds of vice, I don't know any thing that de&s;erves greater reprobation than Hypo|cri&s;y; and yet nothing is more general in the world. The hypocrite, who carries two faces, be|trays you under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, and is le&s;s to be forgiven than a highway robber.

<P>The world is, in general, &s;o deceitful, and &s;o fuli of di&s;&s;imulation, that the incautious are ea&s;ily taken in, and naturally &s;uppo&s;e them to be their friends, who, in reality, are their enemies. The Flatterer is of this &s;tamp, though not of &s;o gro&s;s a complexion; and it behoves us to be as much upon our guard again&s;t a man of this de&s;cription, as a lurking enemy. The misfortune is, that &s;elf-love leads a per&s;on to court prai&s;e, and be fond of flat|terers; and &s;uch as are expert in this art, will do it in &s;o &s;ly and in&s;inuating a manner, as to make us believe, that what they &s;ay is the real &s;entiments of their hearts. The cu&s;tomary compliments in life are plea&s;ing, ingratiating, and denote good-breed|ing; but when they degenerate into flattery, to a &s;en&s;ible man, they are ful&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>

<P>Great familiarity and intimacy is highly impro|per on &s;light acquaintance; it is &s;carcely prudent even between tho&s;e who have long known each other; for he who unbo&s;oms him&s;elf to every one he meets, &s;tands a chance of having a dagger plunged in his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed, the integrity of mankind is &s;o little to be relied on, that a wi&s;e man will be cautious in all his words, and never &s;ay that to his mo&s;t intimate friend, that he would not &s;ay to his bittere&s;t enemy; for a future di&s;agreement may alienate the friend|&s;hip of &s;uch a man, and you may be &s;orry for hav|ing placed a confidence in him.

<P>THIS Proverb requires no interpretation, conveying its moral literally:&mdash;but pride, however here alluded to, by no means implies that commendable pride, which dignifies, and is e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good man; but that lordly o&s;tentation, that haughty demeanor in af|fluence, which &s;purns at, and contemns an inferior in birth, fortune or &s;ituation; and engro&s;&s;es our

<P>The up&s;tart, in our print, nur&s;ed in the lap of ea&s;e, who&s;e father's death put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fortune, having launched into all the fa&s;hionable follies of the age, embarked in a life of vice and voluptuous plea&s;ure, has here &s;uffered an incon&s;ide|rate pride to lead him to the brink of a dreadful precipice. See his reception of the wretched pau|per his father's bounty had often fed&mdash;he ca&s;ts on him a &s;cornful look&mdash;the &s;neer of contempt&mdash;and that too at a moment when one &s;tep more mu&s;t &s;o fatally &s;hew him his pa&s;t errors.

<PB N="23" REF="31">that the &s;ame cau&s;e (affluence) may produce the &s;ame effect&mdash;(benevolence),&mdash;No;&mdash;deaf to every thing but the impul&s;es of his own vain mind, he gives not a &s;ingle mite to the fami&s;hed wretch, who regrets, that with the means, we do not always inherit an inclination, to do good. Age, however, which has furrowed his brow with wrinkles, leaves him the plea&s;ing comfort of a peaceful con&s;cience; and though in the mid&s;t of poverty, he enjoys a placid &s;erenity, being under the immediate eye of Providence, who turneth all things to our good: whil&s;t the other, wrapt up in fancied greatne&s;s, looks not a &s;tep before him, but falls down the precipice his pride had led him to. What are then the con&s;equences? By this precipice we are to under&s;tand the downfal of Pride, when Di&s;&s;ipation &s;hall have &s;tripped him of all the gay feathers with which he plumed him&s;elf; when his wealth has taken wing to a new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; when his mind &s;hall be filled with remor&s;e and horror, and he be left naked and de&s;titute. This is often the fate of the haughty, and the end of the proud man. Then, like the Prodigal Son, he &s;hall be feeding with &s;wine, and covet the &s;ituation of the hireling and the &s;lave: but, even in this hopele&s;s &s;tate, there is a chance of redemption. Misfortunes, if we con&s;true them right, are me&s;&s;engers, never &s;ent without an errand.
<PB N="24" REF="32">They either come to remind us of pa&s;t &s;ollies; to correct the pre&s;ent, or prevent the future. Altho' then it is truly commendable to act with becoming &s;pirit; with &s;uch a pride, as is con&s;i&s;tent with our &s;ituations in life; yet to exceed this, is but to in|dulge a di&s;po&s;ition of malevolence, which can com|municate no real &s;atisfaction. If it plea&s;es Provi|dence to ble&s;s us, and rai&s;e us above the common level of mankind, we &s;hould not pre&s;ume on this, but act our part accordingly.

<P>THIS Proverb is generally, though errone|ou&s;ly, u&s;ed as a plea by tho&s;e who &s;tudy to gratify revenge for any trivial injury they may conceive they have &s;u&s;tained; but this is by no means the moral we &s;hould draw from it; or that conclu&s;ion which calm reflection will ju&s;tify.&mdash;When, to indulge a vicious inclination, we wound the ea&s;e of a neighbour, either by defaming his

<P>There is a very material difference between ju&s;t re&s;entment and unlawful revenge. It is certainly the part of an hone&s;t and upright mind, to &s;hew a proper contempt, a con&s;i&s;tent re&s;entment at what|ever arraigns the honor or integrity of our principles, and to turn (tho' in adver&s;ity) when thus trod upon, by even the &s;plendid &s;ons of affluence: to endea|vour, as far as our &s;ituation and circum&s;tances will admit, to avoid a renewal, or continuance of &s;uch injuries, as may convert a proper re&s;entment into incon&s;iderate revenge.&mdash;"Love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you," was an injunction of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; and, however dif|ficult its practice may &s;eem, it certainly is within every one's power, if not to do good, at lea&s;t to do no harm to his enemy. Having &s;aid thus much on the mi&s;application of this Proverb, and the per|ver&s;ion of the &s;entiment it contains, let us examine its real tendency, and what it is meant to inculcate. It is meant then to teach us, that how trifling, how abject, how in&s;ignificant &s;oever per&s;ons may appear to us, at the moment we tread upon them, a change
<PB N="27" REF="35">of fortune, and a poignant recollection of injuries, may render their turning on us &s;erious indeed!&mdash; Let us look round us, and we &s;hall find many who have, either by the long pur&s;uits of hone&s;t indu&s;|try, the death of others, &s;uperior abilities, or un|expected cau&s;es, ri&s;en from the vale of indigence to the height of competence, if not to the pinnacle of affluence.&mdash;Then it is they will turn&mdash;then will they with-hold tho&s;e offices of friend&s;hip they would otherwi&s;e have done us, and of which we may &s;tand in need; then it is they will recollect, that we had not done by them, when in our power, as we would then be done by.</P>
<P>The hoary veteran, in our print, con&s;trained by penury and want, implores charity, under the walls of that very citadel, his earlier days &s;aw him bravely defending.&mdash;A golden chain, or a wooden leg, were the extremes of his hope and fear.&mdash; Poor fellow!&mdash;he has got the latter.&mdash;An imperi|ous Turk, enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of a peace, which the other's toils and &s;ervices have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ecure, &s;wings; fearle&s;s and undi&s;turbed, in all the pomp of ea&s;tern magnificence, and indulges every wi&s;h a &s;plendid affluence can create. He pa&s;&s;es the &s;up|plicating &s;oldier without attention, without be&s;tow|ing the &s;lighte&s;t token of commi&s;eration; and with|out thinking, that tho' he does no good, he may do

<P>Even the &s;lave, who follows him, is infected with his ma&s;ter's pride; and, by the &s;neer upon his countenance, illu&s;trates the Proverb, <HI>Trim Tram&mdash; Like Ma&s;ter, like Man.</HI>&mdash; Ae&s;op tells us of the &s;ucce&s;sful efforts made by the grateful mou&s;e to re&s;|cue the embarra&s;&s;ed lion; of the bee's effecting the dove's e&s;cape from the fowler&mdash;both from the re|collection of former &s;ervices.

<P>THIS Proverb has been generally mi&s;under|&s;tood and mi&s;applied.

We here &s;ee an in&s;tance of it. A hungry pauper has ju&s;t received a me&s;s of pottage from the hands of bene|volence; and two or three poor wretches, as hun|gry
<PB N="30" REF="38">as him&s;elf, are craving part of it; but he is deaf to their &s;olicitations, and &s;teels his heart again&s;t their wants. It is not that a man is expected to give away what he is going to eat, to any vagrant that may a&s;k him; but there is a method of re|fu&s;ing an alms, that reflects no di&s;credit on the re|fu&s;er. Self-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of nature; and we are ju&s;tifiable in providing food for our|&s;elves and families; but that being done, a good chri&s;tian, and one who can feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of another, will naturally be&s;tow a little of what he can &s;pare, to tho&s;e to whom Fortune has not been &s;o bountiful as to him&s;elf. He who is poore&s;t has al|ways &s;omething to &s;pare; and a cup of cold water, given in the &s;pirit of charity, will mark the di&s;po|&s;ition of the giver. To take care of our&s;elves and families, and provide again&s;t an evil day, is cer|tainly the duty of every man. In this &s;en&s;e cha|rity may be &s;aid to <HI>begin at home.</HI> As a man &s;hould be ju&s;t before he is generous, &s;o &s;hould he be prudent before he is charitable: that is to &s;ay, there is no more room for a per&s;on in debt to be generous, than there is for him to be charitable, whil&s;t his family is unprovided for. But, if charity, in this &s;en&s;e, &s;hould <HI>begin</HI> at home, it is not nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould <HI>end</HI> there al&s;o. The provi&s;ion we are to
<PB N="31" REF="39">make for our&s;elves is not to be boundle&s;s. When we enjoy fully the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and &s;ome of its comforts, we &s;hould be willing to contribute to the nece&s;&s;ities of others; impart tho&s;e comforts where we can, and not &s;uffer our unlimited wants to be an excu&s;e for uncharitablene&s;s.</P>
<P>God is bountiful to <HI>us,</HI> and we &s;hould be &s;o to our <HI>fellow-creatures.</HI> Was a man to live for him&s;elf alone, he would be the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h of all animals. Charity is the characteri&s;tic or di&s;tinctive mark of a chri&s;tian. St. Paul &s;ays, that void of Charity, we are nothing but "as &s;ounding bra&s;s and a tinkling cymbal;" alluding to tho&s;e who are all words, make great profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, and perform not a &s;ingle act of benevolence. Charity is, in fact, &s;o godlike a virtue, that our religion teaches us "it &s;hall cover a multitude of &s;ins." But charity, in this &s;en&s;e, is not limited to giving away part of our &s;ub&s;tance, but to that love of our fellow-creature as would lead us to &s;tudy his intere&s;t. "Charity," &s;ays St. Paul, "&s;uffereth long, and is kind; is not given to revenge. Charity envieth not; covets no man's property. Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf; is not puffed up;" that is, boa&s;ts not of its merits, but is humble and meek, and "behaveth not it&s;elf un&s;eemly." In &s;hort, it is tender-hearted; feels
<PB N="32" REF="40">for the calamities of the unfortunate; and relieves them where it can; does it from a conviction of the natural weakne&s;s of mankind; acts from what it feels it&s;elf; rea&s;ons from its own wants, and, in the true &s;en&s;e of the Proverb, originates in its own nature, and <HI>begins at Home.</HI></P>

<P>THIS is addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who de&s;pond, in or|der to teach them philo&s;ophy, and &s;hew them that whatever is, is be&s;t: there is no event in life, but what tends to &s;ome good purpo&s;e; and that even misfortunes are not without their u&s;es. There is a &s;uperintending Providence, who overlooks our actions, who&s;e ways are higher than <HI>our</HI> ways, and
<PB N="34" REF="42"><HI>his</HI> thoughts than <HI>our</HI> thoughts; and who frequently &s;uffers evil to happen, that good may ari&s;e. Often are the righteous afflicted, that their patience may be tried, as was the ca&s;e with Job; and often are calamities &s;ent into the world to alarm mankind, and bring them back from the paths of &s;in and folly into tho&s;e of virtue.</P>
<Q><L>The ways of Heav'n are dark and intricate,</L>
<L>Puzzl'd with mazes, and perplex'd with errors;</L>
<L>Our under&s;tanding traces them in vain,</L>
<L>(Lo&s;t and bewilder'd in the fruitle&s;s &s;earch)</L>
<L>Nor knows with how much art the windings run,</L>
<L>Nor where the regular confu&s;ion ends.</L>
<BIBL>ADDISON'S CATO.</BIBL></Q>
<P>This Proverb then teaches men patience and re|&s;ignation under the wor&s;t of circum&s;tances, and enables them to &s;tem that tide of &s;orrow, that would otherwi&s;e too often overpower them.</P>
<P>In common events all tend to &s;ome good. If too much rain floods the low lands, it enriches the high ones; and if too much drowth burns up the high grounds, it drys, and does a great deal of good to the low ones. A flood that &s;hall be be|neficial to the farmer, &s;hall be injurious to the
<PB N="35" REF="43">miller; &s;o that if any thing &s;hall occur that may be detrimental in one ca&s;e, we are not to repine, if it proves beneficial in another; but we are bound to wait the&s;e events without murmuring at the di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence, who does good to all men, in turn; but reconcile our&s;elves to any &s;eem|ing misfortune; and, from an opinion that it is an act of Heaven, who has &s;omething in view above our capacities to di&s;cern, ki&s;s the rod that cha&s;ti&s;es us, and prai&s;e the hand that holds it.</P>
<P>The painter has rather taken an unfavourable view of this truth; he has exhibited here a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, and a number of wretches profiting by it. A high wind has thrown a &s;hip upon a rock, and it becomes a wreck. Part of the cargo has floated a&s;hore, and the inhuman inhabitants are eager to enjoy the plunder. Whil&s;t &s;ome are carry|ing off part, others are running to take away more. Cruel as &s;uch conduct is, it is too common on the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and he has de&s;cribed the unfeeling di&s;|po&s;ition of the plunderers, by the joy he has paint|ed in their countenances. If there is any degree of cruelty greater than another, it is this, of rob|bing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and taking plea&s;ure in the ca|lamity of others. I will clo&s;e this &s;ubject with an epigram &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>THIS &s;trongly &s;hews the force of all example, and the evil tendency of bad ones. If we take a glance round us, we &s;hall in general find, that though, as Gay &s;ays,
<Q>Learning was ne'er entailed from &s;on to &s;on;</Q>
yet Vice is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, hereditary. We &s;hall &s;ee the children of the mo&s;t abandoned treading,
<PB N="38" REF="46">through prevalence of example, and for want of good advice, in the foot&s;teps of their parents, and becoming, literally, <HI>Chips of the old Block.</HI> Let us not, however, witne&s;s this &s;ad truth, without being our&s;elves imitative&mdash;not of the bad, but of the good qualities of our relatives and a&s;&s;ociates. It is in our younger years that we attract tho&s;e habits, that either &s;weeten or embitter our future lives. Our minds, when young, are like tinder&mdash; they will catch any &s;park, whether emitted by Virtue or by Vice; and it is to be lamented, that the latter emits them more than the former.</P>
<Q><L>With early Virtue plant the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;pecious arts of Vice dete&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>The worthy youth, who carefully &s;huns the com|pany of the wicked and the irreligious; who con|templates, with &s;erious attention, the many ble&s;|&s;ings his friends enjoy from the practices of vir|tue, will not be contaminated. Example will not, to &s;uch a mind, render vice familiar; but, if he avoids the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who will in|culcate in him virtuous principles, and a&s;&s;oci|ates with tho&s;e who will engraft ignoble ones, he will in&s;en&s;ibly contract a habit, that he may afterwards wi&s;h to abandon, but in vain; and find,
<PB N="39" REF="47">when too late, that&mdash;<HI>What's bred in the bone, will never out of the fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Our painter has illu&s;trated this truth forcibly.&mdash; The man in the &s;tocks at once &s;hews the cau&s;e, and its effects. Cards and dice, the forerunners of greater vices, have brought him there.&mdash;Lo&s;s pro|duced quarrels, quarrels puni&s;hment, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring him. Happy would it be, &s;hould this be the wor&s;t con&s;equence of a de&s;tructive at|tachment!&mdash;No; his cards, box and dice, be&s;ide him, tell us, that his pre&s;ent ignominy will not in|duce him to abandon them. His father was a gambler too; and, to &s;upply his lo&s;&s;es, invaded the property of others, for which he forfeited his life to the laws of his country. See him hanging on a gibbet on the hill behind. This &s;on was then an infant. His mother, poor creature, the partner of his father's &s;orrows, though not of his guilt, the law being &s;atisfied, and &s;he a widow,</P>
<Q><L>Bent o'er her babe, her eyes di&s;&s;olv'd in dew;</L>

<L>Gave the &s;ad pre&s;age of his future years.</L>
<L>The Child of Mi&s;ery, &s;he baptiz'd in tears.</L></Q>
<P>Grief overcame her&mdash;&s;he died, leaving her orphan to the protection of an uncle, who inherited his bro|ther's vices. See him ju&s;t quitting the public-hou&s;e,
<PB N="40" REF="48">not from inclination, but nece&s;&s;ity, to di&s;gorge the quantity of liquor he had there &s;wallowed, and to return "as a dog to his vomit." Nor will he probably leave it, till, flu&s;hed with liquor, he &s;hall &s;ally forth to commit &s;ome de&s;perate deed. Can we notice his &s;hocking &s;u&s;pen&s;ions of rea&s;on, and not believe it po&s;&s;ible that this man's end will be like his bro|ther's; not credit the a&s;&s;ertion, that the &s;on will, in time, follow both the uncle and the father?</P>
<P>Our painter has further illu&s;trated the Proverb, by the brood of ducks, which have been hatched by a hen, and who, for&s;aking her wing, and fol|lowing the bent of nature, have taken to the water, amid all the fright and anxiety of the mother for their &s;afety. The fighting cocks a&s;&s;ixed as a &s;ign under the grapes, whi&s;per al&s;o, that immoderate drinking often &s;ets the be&s;t friends and relations at variance, for <HI>When the Wine's in, the Wit's out.</HI>&mdash; It behoves us therefore to avoid it, and, by a&s;&s;o|ciating with none but good and virtuous men, con|tract no unworthy habit: but &s;eeing the progre&s;&s;ion from drunkenne&s;s to ignominious death, and the dreadful effects of bad examples, endeavour to avoid them; for the Proverb &s;ays, and the young ducks and game-combatants declare the &s;ame, that <HI>What's bred in the bone will never out of the fle&s;h.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Set a Beggar on Hor&s;eback, and he will ride to the Devil.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THIS Proverb has an affinity with the la&s;t, &s;hewing its meaning in another &s;en&s;e; but has rather a worldly, than a moral tendency. It implies, that put a man out of his natural &s;phere, and he will act like a fool. We &s;eldom, if ever, &s;ee a proper con&s;i&s;tency pre&s;erved by men that have been &s;uddenly and greatly rai&s;ed in life. Their
<PB N="42" REF="50">actions corre&s;pond with their ideas, which &s;eldom, if ever alter. Let a man be low-bred, and his ideas will be groveling. Take a woman from her kitchen, marry her to a Duke, and &s;he will ever &s;avour of the grea&s;e-pot. In &s;hort&mdash;<HI>What's bred in the bone, will never out of the fle&s;h&mdash;It is impo&s;|&s;ible to make a &s;ilk pur&s;e of a &s;ow's ear.</HI>&mdash;For, as So|lomon &s;ays of a &s;inner&mdash;A vulgar fellow will "return like a dog to his vomit, or a &s;ow to her wallowing in the mire."</P>
<P>The painter, in the &s;cene he has repre&s;ented, &s;eems to allude to the moral &s;en&s;e of this Proverb; that a man, bred up in vice, will gradually make greater &s;trides till he brings de&s;truction on his head. Beggars have no idea of riding, but that of gallop|ing as fa&s;t they can go. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have the care of a gentleman's hor&s;e for a few minutes, with orders, as he was warm, to walk him up and down, that he might not take cold. In&s;tead of this, he mounts him, flogs the poor animal into full &s;peed, and, regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences, if he is not going to the Devil him&s;elf, is in a fair way of &s;ending a poor old woman there, with all her &s;ins upon her head, having rode over her.</P>
<P>Under this &s;en&s;e of the Proverb, we are taught never to employ immoral, or improper per&s;ons, in any of our affairs; the former will be likely to in|jure
<PB N="43" REF="51">us, and the latter to di&s;grace us: for, in|dependent of any injury we may &s;u&s;tain, whatever wrong they do, the blame will be &s;ure to fall upon us. It is under this rea&s;oning that the law makes the ma&s;ter re&s;pon&s;ible for the conduct of his &s;er|vant, when that &s;ervant acts by his ma&s;ter's orders.</P>
<P>It is the height of folly for a man to undertake an office he is not capable of; but, if he is pre&s;um|ing enough to do it, the fault is in his employer, who ought to make him&s;elf acquainted with the in|tegrity and abilities of tho&s;e he employs.</P>
<P>Fortune, in her wanton moments, has been often favourable to low-bred men, and rai&s;ed them from a &s;tate of poverty to a degree of affluence, that has an&s;wered no other purpo&s;e than to turn their brain. Far from carrying their &s;ucce&s;s in life with diffidence and mode&s;ty, they become arrogant and a&s;&s;uming; and, in&s;tead of gaining friends, create a number of enemies, who not only de&s;pi&s;e them, but laugh at them.</P>
<P>How often have we &s;een the children of poor parents, whom Fortune has &s;miled on, when they have grown rich, de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e parents becau&s;e they were poor; and, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in their advanced years, and letting them &s;hare the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy them&s;elves, have de&s;erted them, and
<PB N="44" REF="52">looked down on their humble &s;tate with contempt? What do &s;uch children de&s;erve?&mdash;Not only the dete&s;tation of all good men, but the vengeance of the Almighty: and be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ooner or later, vengeance will overtake them; for, <HI>Set a Beggar on Hor&s;eback, and he will ride to the Devil.</HI></P>

<P>BY the laws, both of God and man, we are bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t our fellow-creatures to the ut|mo&s;t of our power, particularly when they need our a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and if we are not enabled by for|tune to do them all the good we wi&s;h, there are times, when a little aid will do a man a great deal of good; and the&s;e are the times we &s;hould &s;tudy to render our&s;elves of &s;ervice. Humanity is a god|like
<PB N="46" REF="54">principle. Our Creator is always planning the good of mankind, and we &s;hould imitate him, as far as our abilities enable us. Indeed, if we ex|pect his favour, we mu&s;t be friendly to tho&s;e about us. If the uncharitable man did but once expe|rience the heart-felt plea&s;ure which the humane man feels within him&s;elf, when he has relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and &s;oothed the de&s;ponding mind, he would never mi&s;s an opportunity of doing a good action, where &s;uch an action was in his reach to perform. To receive the grateful thanks and ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e we relieve, is, to a &s;en&s;ible mind, a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for any trouble we may take, or any money we may expend in doing them a kind office. What is the u&s;e of money, if it be not to gratify and plea&s;e our&s;elves?&mdash;and &s;urely there is no plea&s;ure equal to that of being a friend to the unfortunate. There are few per&s;ons but what &s;pend &s;ome idle money; and that which they throw away, would gladden many a poor man's heart. If we time our charity, a &s;mall &s;um, given on certain occa&s;ions, will do far greater &s;ervice, than double the &s;um at others.</P>
<P>We have here an in&s;tance of a humane man vi&s;it|ing the hou&s;e of Poverty. An old man, in the decline of life, lying on a &s;ick bed, &s;upported by
<PB N="47" REF="55">the labour of a widowed daughter; and who, hav|ing children of her own, the little &s;he earns, di|vided among them, is &s;carce &s;ufficient to keep life together. The &s;canty meal her indu&s;try is capable to procure, &s;hared among the whole, is not &s;uffi|cient to &s;atisfy the hunger even of a &s;ick man. Her love for a blind and aged father, and an infant-family, makes her inability to afford them nece&s;&s;a|ries, a heart-breaking affliction. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s, God &s;ends a benevolent young gentle|man to their ragged cottage. The natural huma|nity and fellow-feeling of this &s;tranger, whom chance brought to their door, led him to enquire the &s;tate of this poor family; and we &s;ee him at that moment when her father and children were crying for food, without being able to procure it, giving them money, and relieving them in this hour of nece&s;&s;ity. The gratitude of this poor fa|mily is evident in their countenances, it affects the heart of their benefactor, draws tears from his eyes, and is a proof of the Proverb, that <HI>A Friend in</HI> Need, <HI>is a Friend</HI> indeed!</P>
<P>Imitate, then, this young gentleman&mdash;do all the good offices you can&mdash;&s;tudy for opportunities to do good.&mdash;Remember that he who is poore&s;t has always &s;omething to &s;pare&punc; and &s;omething that
<PB N="48" REF="56">another wants; and if you be&s;tow that &s;omething with a willing heart, you will not only have a re|ward in Heaven, but the good word of all your ac|quaintance, and the ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e you relieve.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e this &s;ubject with the following bon|mot.&mdash;A man told an acquaintance he had been to vi&s;it a poor friend in pri&s;on.&mdash;"Then he mu&s;t be a valuable one," replied the latter, for a <HI>Friend in</HI> Need, <HI>is a</HI> Friend <HI>indeed.</HI></P>

We are cer|tainly ju&s;tifiable in &s;tudying to avoid misfortunes, and to extricate our&s;elves from tho&s;e we may chance to be involved in; but a religious man will, at the &s;ame time, turn his thoughts within his own brea&s;t; con&s;ider how far he has de&s;erved the correction, ki&s;s the rod that cha&s;ti&s;es him, be grateful to Provi|dence that he has left a way to e&s;cape, and, act like the philo&s;opher, who, having broke his leg, thank|ed God it was not his neck.</P>

<P>The painter has here given us a good idea of noi&s;e without profit; the &s;hrieking of the Devils, the &s;queaking of the hogs, the ru&s;tling and whi&s;t|ling of the &s;torm, and the clattering of the magpie.</P>
<P>It is related of the late Duke of Newca&s;tle, who was prime min&s;ter, that no man was freer of his promi&s;es, and le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to perform them. A Major, whom the Duke thought proper to receive, returned, in the time of war, from his regiment, with the lo&s;s of his leg; on his waiting on the Duke, the Duke flew to embrace him, with&mdash;"My dear Major, I hope I &s;ee you well."&mdash;"Indeed, my Lord," replied he, "you don't, for I am out of &s;pirits&mdash;I have lo&s;t my&mdash;" "Say no more, my dear Major," &s;aid the Duke, &s;topping his mouth with his hand, and conceiving it to be &s;ome promo|tion he had mi&s;&s;ed, "Say no more, I will give you a better."&mdash;"That's impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord," returns the Major, "for I have lo&s;t my leg."</P>
<P>A man who values his word, and wi&s;hes for the confidence of his friends, is very cautious in his pro|mi&s;es; but, when he does promi&s;e, endeavours all he can to fulfil them. It is this integrity that makes men re&s;pectable, and gives them weight and con&s;e|quence with tho&s;e who know them; but tho&s;e who
<PB N="55" REF="63">are profu&s;e in profe&s;&s;ions of &s;ervices, be a&s;&s;ured never mean to perform them.</P>
<P>So again, many a man will tell you, with a &s;queeze of the hand, he has only to lament that it is not in his power to &s;erve you: when, if he had it in his power, he would be the la&s;t that would do it.</P>
<P>This Proverb alludes al&s;o to tho&s;e vain boa&s;ters, who arrogate to them&s;elves a merit they are no ways entitled to. Such men, con&s;cious of their defects, and a&s;hamed that the world &s;hould &s;ee them, endea|vour to conceal tho&s;e defects, by boa&s;ting of an oppo&s;ite virtue. A liar will tell you, that he could not form his tongue to a lie, though it was to &s;ave his life; when at the &s;ame time he is telling a number.&mdash;So an uncharitable man will often boa&s;t of doing &s;ome trifling act of good, and preface it with&mdash;"I believe I was made with different feel|ings from other men, for I can't pa&s;s by an object of compa&s;&s;ion without relieving him; not if it was the la&s;t penny I had."</P>
<P>All this is ridiculous.&mdash;Truth and &s;incerity are the be&s;t &s;tamps of a good character; and a little knowledge of the world is &s;ufficient to di&s;cern the true from the counterfeit.</P>

<P>THE character of a man is of &s;uch importance to his well-being in the world, that to rob him of it, is, perhaps, more cruel than to take away his life. By murdering a man, we deprive him, indeed, of exi&s;tence, but our malevolence there finds an end: he is then beyond the reach of ma|lice, and, perhaps, becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;tate of

To rob a man of his character, therefore, is turning him, unarmed, amid&s;t a number of enemies, an act more cruel than murder; and its wantonne&s;s is equal to its barbarity: for whil&s;t the &s;landerer is mangling the reputation of another, he is doing him&s;elf di&s;&s;ervice.

<P>TO &s;peak in di&s;paragement of coin, or money, would look only like envying the good for|tune of others; for as the rich can command &s;ome enjoyments out of the reach of the poor, money has always been con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing; and to ac|quire money has been the con&s;tant &s;tudy of mankind. But, when we call money a ble&s;&s;ing, it is nece&s;&s;ary to draw the line; for though riches bring com|forts,
<PB N="62" REF="70">they likewi&s;e bring cares; and there is no real enjoyment in any wealth, that is not properly made u&s;e of. We are taught by our religion, that the goods of this life are entru&s;ted to us by our Creator, for the purpo&s;e of doing good. Was all mankind equally rich, it would interrupt the order of &s;ociety, and prevent men from being u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to each other. God, therefore, has e&s;tabli&s;hed the poor to be of u&s;e to &s;ociety; but, having done this, he has made &s;ome men rich, in order to return tho&s;e &s;ervices by protection and good offices; and if a man u&s;es his wealth to any other purpo&s;e, he be|trays the tru&s;t that Providence has repo&s;ed in him, and counteracts the will of Heaven.</P>
<P>"Learn to be content," &s;ays St. Paul, "in that &s;tate of life in which it has plea&s;ed God to place you;" and be a&s;&s;ured, that whether you are poor or rich, you are equally re&s;pectable in God's eyes, provided you act uprightly in the &s;tation of life you are in. Competence is the only wealth a man &s;hould covet; that is, a &s;ufficient income to &s;upport him in the rank of life in which he &s;tands, and afford him the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts attendant on that rank. All beyond this, is trouble and anxiety; and if his heart is &s;et upon further wi&s;hes, they are only a torment to him. The painter has &s;et this forth in the &s;cene before us. We &s;ee here pictured a man
<PB N="63" REF="71">&s;hut up in his clo&s;et, counting his money, conceived, by the &s;hip above him, to be acquired by mer|chandize. We will &s;uppo&s;e it hone&s;tly gained; but, as his heart &s;eems centered in his gold, it robs him of his enjoyment. It is not a lock, or &s;trong box that can &s;et his mind at ea&s;e.&mdash;He dreads not only &s;hipwrecks and thieves, but is alarmed at every &s;tep he hears. Even the entrance of his old, tru&s;ty valet, with a letter, alarms him, and all his fear is painted on his countenance. This man has not a peaceful moment; independent of the anxiety ari&s;ing from lo&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hipwrecks, and the like, he is in con&s;tant dread of lo&s;ing part of what he has; and this dread is a continual tor|ment, and likely to end only with his life. But Death, which frees a man from all cares, is here &s;een at the window, lifting up the &s;a&s;h, and taking from him the whole. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, how much happier would this man have been, had he cultivated in his brea&s;t a &s;pirit of benevolence, and could have brought him&s;elf to di&s;tribute that &s;uperfluous trea|&s;ure he is here &s;uppo&s;ed to have hoarded, among &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects, as mu&s;t have fallen within his knowledge! By relieving the&s;e, he would have &s;tood in no want either of bolts or boxes, but would have "laid up a trea&s;ure in heaven, where thieves do not break through nor &s;teal."</P>

<P>This Proverb has a reference al&s;o to our actions; teaching us circum&s;pection in what we do; and reminding us, t we are open to the eyes of a di&s;cerning and ill-natured world, who perhaps will not put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;tructions on them. It is a difficult thing, I allow, always to &s;peak and act, &s;o as to avoid cen&s;ure; but it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary not to indulge our&s;elves in &s;uch acts as will not bear the te&s;t of day-light, under an idea that we are in the dark, and no eye can &s;ee us.

And, as his future happine&s;s depends on the integrity of his heart, if he has any regard for him&s;elf, he will conduct him&s;elf &s;o as to &s;tand ju&s;tified in the eye of Heaven; and &s;o doing, if he makes his heart and his tongue &s;peak the &s;ame language, he will go the &s;ure&s;t way to avoid the ill-natured remarks of a cen&s;orious world.</P>

<P>THIS Proverb is de&s;igned to &s;hew the preva|lence of Habit, whether in good actions or bad. Children, &s;ays a philo&s;opher, are like blank paper, we may write on them what we plea&s;e; and, according to what we write, that is, accord|ing to the education or in&s;truction we give them, &s;o &s;hall we form their di&s;po&s;itions.&mdash;"Train up a child," &s;ays Solomon. "in the way wherein he
<PB N="82" REF="92">&s;hould go, and when he is old-he will not depart from it."&mdash;What we are accu&s;tomed to in youth, becomes familiar to us in more advanced life, and will then be, as it were, natural to us.</P>
<P>The painter has drawn his illu&s;tration of this truth from a winter-&s;cene in the country, that of &s;cating on the ice; and has &s;hewn us, that whil&s;t tho&s;e in years, who have been u&s;ed to &s;helter them&s;elves from the inclemency of the weather, &s;hall &s;hake with cold in the open air, tho' wrapt up in furs; and whil&s;t one young man &s;hall be blowing his fingers and &s;hrinking from the cold, another, who has accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to the for&s;t, &s;hall be chearfully &s;cating, regardle&s;s of the pinching &s;ea&s;on. He teaches us al&s;o by the contra&s;ted appearance of the beggar-boy &s;liding even with fear, whil&s;t the young gentleman, next him, is &s;cating away with courage, that this exerci&s;e does not depend only on being able to endure the cold, for one is as able to do that as the other, but that the art of &s;cating, difficult as it may be, is to be acquired only by practice and habit. One &s;tands firm, and makes his way on an edge, le&s;s than half an inch in thickne&s;s, whil&s;t the other can &s;carce keep his footing on a much broader ba&s;is. This is the effect al&s;o of Cu&s;tom; having practi&s;ed it long, it is become natural to the former, and he bears the
<PB N="83" REF="93">cold, and travels on the ice with as much, or more &s;ecurity than the latter can, even on the ground.&mdash;So is it in life; whatever we are accu&s;tomed to, becomes, as it were our nature, and we can do it with the greate&s;t facility. One man &s;hall &s;wim as well as a duck, to whom water is a natural ele|ment, whil&s;t another cannot keep him&s;elf from drowning: &s;o will a bricklayer, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to roof hou&s;es, run &s;afe and unconcerned along the ridge of a roof, whil&s;t another, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch practices, &s;hall not be able to keep his feet.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the force of Cu&s;tom, we &s;ee how nece&s;|&s;&s;ary it is to train up youth properly, before improper habits have taken hold of them; for &s;uch is the misfortune, that <HI>Habit is &s;econd Nature;</HI> and when once we have acquired a bad one, it is not readily got the better of. Every little, ungain, aukward trick a man &s;hall acquire in his youth, he will carry to the grave with him.&mdash;Con&s;idering this Pro|verb, then, in a moral &s;en&s;e, it is, above all things, requi&s;ite, that good principles &s;hould be early in|&s;tilled, le&s;t the natural pronene&s;s of mankind to evil &s;hould take root in him, and, in the cour&s;e of years, be &s;o blended with his nature, as not to be conquered.&mdash;<HI>What's bred in the Bone will never out of the Fle&s;h,</HI> is a maxim &s;imilar in allu&s;ion to the one before us, and confirms the doctrine we have
<PB N="84" REF="94">laid down, that Cu&s;toms, rooted in us by Habit, will continue with us through life.</P>
<P>Whatever we do, therefore, let us be careful not to acquire bad habits, under an idea of drop|ping them when we plea&s;e. They are not &s;o rea|dily dropped as we imagine; for the human frame is a machine that will often act involuntarily, and pur&s;ue a bias to which it has been accu&s;tomed, be that bias as injurious to its nature as it may.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;trength of this le&s;&s;on al&s;o, let us take courage, and never be di&s;mayed at the diffi|culties we meet with. Such things, as at fir&s;t ap|pear in&s;urmountable, by practice, are often over|come, and rendered ea&s;y, for <HI>Patience and Per&s;e|verance overcometh all things.</HI>&mdash;"E&s;chew evil, then, and do good;" and remember the words of Scripture, that, "He who holdeth out to the la&s;t, &s;hall be &s;aved."&mdash;That is to &s;ay, Shun every evil way, pur&s;ue the good, and, my life for it, in the end, you will have occa&s;ion to rejoice. The good habits you acquire, will in&s;ure you a re&s;pectable character through life, and a peaceful con&s;cience in your la&s;t moments; and be a&s;&s;ured, every evil is to be &s;ubdued by a per&s;everance in well-doing, for <HI>Cu&s;tom is &s;econd Nature.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Creditors have better Memories than Debtors.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THERE is a great deal of knowledge couch|ed under the&s;e words, and the Proverb may be taken in more &s;en&s;es than one. In the literal &s;en&s;e it implies, that Creditors are the more im|portunate, as they find tho&s;e who are in their debt unwilling to pay what they owe. Indeed, &s;uch is the misfortune of trade, that, unle&s;s a man will give credit, he will have few cu&s;tomers: and &s;uch
<PB N="86" REF="96">the di&s;po&s;ition of the world, that as things are e&s;timated by appearances, and men are re|&s;pected, in proportion to the figure they make in life, they are naturally covetous of re&s;pect, make the be&s;t appearance they can, live to the very out|&s;ide of their fortunes, and willing as they may be, to pay what they owe, they often find them&s;elves unable. This di&s;tre&s;&s;es the trade&s;man who gives them credit, makes him importunate in his appli|cations; and the debtor, rather than acknowledge him&s;elf poor, affects not to remember the debt he owes. Of cour&s;e, it being the intere&s;t of the one to remind, and that of the other to forget, <HI>Credi|tors,</HI> in pur&s;uing their intere&s;t, are &s;aid to <HI>have better memories than Debtors,</HI> who wi&s;h to forget the obligation. This is bad policy, but &s;uch is the fact. It would be far better, and more ho|nourable for a debtor to aknowledge what he owes, and throw him&s;elf on the lenity of his creditor, than to trifle with his character, anger his appli|cant, and induce him to take ho&s;tile mea&s;ures again&s;t him,</P>
<P>The engraver, in the print before us, has taken up the Proverb in this &s;en&s;e. A man who&s;e cre|dulous mind and ea&s;y temper has led him to give long credit, to the impoveri&s;hment of him&s;elf: and whil&s;t he has been admini&s;tering to the comfort
<PB N="87" REF="97">of others, his own circum&s;tances have grown out at elbows, and he is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of wearing a threadbare coat. In this &s;tate we &s;ee him humbly applying for payment, to one who is in his debt; and this man, unthinking and merci|le&s;s, forgets, or affects to forget, that he owes him any thing; and to carry on the farce, and ap|pear ab&s;orbed in thought, &s;uffers the dog to water again&s;t his leg, as it were, unnoticed. He is here pictured as apart from his company, con&s;cious that an application of this kind would di&s;grace him, and let him down in the eyes of his acquaintance, with whom he has pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as a man of for|tune.</P>
<P>In a figurative &s;en&s;e, the Proverb teaches that <HI>none are &s;o deaf as tho&s;e that</HI> won't <HI>hear.</HI> Intere&s;t is the greate&s;t per&s;wa&s;ive to all worldly act, and where intere&s;t leads the man to forget, be a&s;&s;ured he will not remember. But when a man is thus artfully deaf, and forgetful to all that is ju&s;t and honourable, let him remember that there are loud calls which he will be obliged to hear, the calls of Law and the calls of Heaven, and he will be &s;orry at having &s;hut his ears to the whi&s;pers of rea&s;on and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o &s;hewn, in another &s;en&s;e, the eager|ne&s;s of men to &s;hut their ears to the applications
<PB N="88" REF="98">of their fellow-creatures, to the plaintive woes of the poor, the cravings of nece&s;&s;ity, and the cries of the wretched: and &s;urely, he that can turn a deaf ear to &s;uch complainants mu&s;t have a mer|cile&s;s di&s;po&s;ition and an unfeeling heart. The poor are ordained by Providence to be the credi|tors of the rich, they have a natural demand on their liberality and charity; and they who are deaf to &s;uch demands, or affect not to remember the obligation, are a di&s;grace humanity, and unde&s;erving of the name of man.</P>
<P>In a further &s;en&s;e, the Proverb teaches us the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the calls of con&s;cience, that great Creditor, who, if its demands are not &s;atisfied in this life, will bring a long account again&s;t us in the next; an account which we &s;hall then be unable to di&s;charge; for then it will be too late. The debts of life are to be paid whil&s;t we live. If we do this con&s;cientiou&s;ly, we &s;hall quit the world un&s;hackled, and having paid the great debt of nature, may hope to live in future bli&s;s, free and unincumbered as the heavenly ho&s;t. Pur&s;uing this conduct, we &s;hall have nothing to fear, though <HI>Creditors have better memories than Debtors.</HI></P>

<P>AND why? Becau&s;e it heaps coals of fire on our enemy's head. This is the worldly meaning of the Proverb, the religious one I &s;hall mention hereafter. Revenge only irritates a-fre&s;h; but "a &s;oft an&s;wer" (&s;ays Solomon) <Q>turneth away wrath:</Q> it di&s;arms the angry man, and tickles him into temper. It is, according to the
<PB N="102" REF="112">vulgar adage, cutting his throat with a feather, and wounding him in a part where he is mo&s;t &s;u&s;|ceptible, I mean his mind. To return <Q>evil for evil, and rai&s;ing for rai&s;ing,</Q> is only making the breach wider, and &s;topping up every avenue to a reconciliation; whereas, to return <Q>good for evil,</Q> is not only chri&s;tian-like, but re|flects the javelin that was thrown at us, and plunges it in the heart of him that threw it. It fills him with &s;hame, to think his enemy &s;hould be &s;o much his &s;uperior, and in cen&s;uring his anta|goni&s;t, he condemns him&s;elf; a wi&s;e man, then, will endeavour to forget a wrong, ju&s;tly conclud|ing that,
<Q><L>Good-nature and good &s;en&s;e &s;hould always join:</L>
<L>To err is human; to forgive, divine.</L></Q></P>
<P>Convinced of the propriety of this doctrine, the painter has repre&s;ented an old warrior, who&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ion is ho&s;tile, entering a citadel with a re|vengeful di&s;po&s;ition, preceded by a hi&s;&s;ing &s;nake, the harbinger of venom: his &s;word is in his hand, and implacability in his countenance. Whatever may have been the offence given, he &s;eems here determined to revenge it; and perhaps, fire and &s;laughter would be the re&s;ult of &s;uch a ra&s;h deter|mination;
<PB N="103" REF="113">but meek-eyed peace arre&s;ts him in his progre&s;s, and with gentle accents, &s;ooths his rage. A conte&s;t en&s;ues between his anger and his pity.&mdash;He grows warm at the offence, but he makes allowance for the offender,&mdash;rankles at the affront, but pities the affronter,&mdash;re&s;ents the in|dignity, but labours to &s;tifle it: and, though me|ditating revenge, he wi&s;hes to forgive it, and Peace whi&s;pering in his ear, <HI>To forget a wrong is the be&s;t revenge;</HI>&mdash;he concedes to the heavenly truth, drops his enmity, and &s;eems truly great, not only in his own eyes, but in the eyes of the world. The city, that a moment before was threatened with de&s;truction, is now &s;ecure from ho&s;tilities. A dove, the emblem of peace and innocence, is bearing an olive-branch; and this man has the honour, not only of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to an enemy, but of tri|umphing over him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed, the revengeful mind is never at ea&s;e: it is not only unhappy, whil&s;t premeditating injury to tho&s;e who have wronged us; but when we have completed our wi&s;hes, and gratified our revenge, it mu&s;t embitter our life, to reflect, that an inhu|man principle has &s;o far led us a&s;tray, as to de&s;troy the happine&s;s, the enjoyments, or perhaps, the life, of a fellow-creature. In mercy, therefore, to our|&s;elves, <HI>to Forget a wrong is the be&s;t revenge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="114">It is far more &s;o, in a religious view. "Ven|geance is mine, &s;aith the Lord, I will repay it." One of the &s;even &s;upplications to Heaven, in our daily prayer, enforces the nece&s;&s;ity of conforming to this admonition, "Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive tho&s;e that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us." If the degree, then, of forgivene&s;s extended to us, be in proportion to that we extend to others, de&s;pe|rate indeed mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of the malicious and revengeful man! When this, therefore, is con&s;i|dered, and more particularly that the Lord will avenge the cau&s;e of the righteous; to forgive and <HI>Forget a wrong,</HI> &s;urely <HI>mu&s;t be the be&s;t revenge.</HI></P>

<P>FROM the de&s;perate &s;ituation of a poor fi&s;h, thrown alive into the water, to be boiled, and jumping in that water for life, and its having no alternative in e&s;caping, but falling in|to the fire, this Proverb would teach us, not to give up one &s;ituation for another, let the fir&s;t be ever &s;o di&s;agreeable, if the &s;econd be not a bet|ter. We are too apt to think our own &s;ituation
<PB N="110" REF="120">of life wor&s;e than that of others, and of cour&s;e to be di&s;contented and di&s;&s;atisfied. But this betrays ignorance and want of rea&s;oning. Be a&s;&s;ured, there is no &s;tate of life without its troubles and in|conveniences; and were we to change it for ano|ther, that other would be not le&s;s burthen&s;ome, though in a different re&s;pect. From habit and cu&s;tom, we are better acquainted with, and feel the troubles attendant on our &s;ituation, more than others can do, who are not &s;o well acquainted with them; and the &s;ame rea&s;oning will tell us, that the burdens and troubles which others feel, we have no idea of; of cour&s;e, a wi&s;h to change one &s;tate for another, unle&s;s we are &s;ure to profit by the change, is only getting <HI>out of the frying-pan into the fire.</HI> "Learn then" (&s;ays St. Paul) <Q>in what&s;oever &s;tate you are, therewith to be content.</Q></P>
<P>We are al&s;o taught here, <HI>of two evils to choo&s;e the lea&s;t;</HI> to do all the good we can, and to do as little wrong as po&s;&s;ible. No man is perfect; we are as naturally prone to &s;in, as the &s;parks fly up|ward; but rea&s;on is given us to &s;ubdue the&s;e na|tural inclinations, and curb the impetuo&s;ity of our tempers. If we mu&s;t commit a &s;in, let it be as little as can be helped. In a worldly &s;en&s;e, by choo&s;ing the lea&s;t of two evils, is under&s;tood, con|&s;idering
<PB N="111" REF="121">well before we determine, and of two &s;ituations in life, to make choice of the better, and of two evils, venture on the lea&s;t. If one man is to put confidence in another, it is better to confide in an hone&s;t man than a rogue; and if a man is to cro&s;s a river, it is &s;afer to pa&s;s it on a bridge, than in a boat. But the fear of danger will naturally point out conduct in &s;uch kind of evils. Man requires only caution in tho&s;e that are more concealed; and the be&s;t advice he can have, is to act, on all occa|&s;ions, with circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>Indeed, there are &s;ituations in life, where duty obliges a man to counter-act his own inclinations; ca&s;es wherein <HI>nece&s;&s;ity having no law,</HI> he is com|pelled to take mea&s;ures which his heart di&s;ap|proves. Such is the &s;ituation of a parent who is frequently obliged to correct the object of his love; and that of a magi&s;trate who, often, for the good of the public, is obliged to take away the life of a fellow-creature. This, indeed, is the particular &s;en&s;e of the Proverb, to which the painter alludes, <HI>Needs mu&s;t when the devil drives.</HI></P>
<P>This Proverb will al&s;o bear another interpreta|tion, namely, that our vicious inclinations, when they get a-head, are a kind of temptation that leads us into &s;in, which requires more than common re|&s;olution to with&s;tand; and like the devil, the pa|rent
<PB N="112" REF="122">of vice, goads us on to do that which our na|ture would otherwi&s;e recoil at. But, it is incumbent on chri&s;tians to re&s;i&s;t the devil, and fly from him, and pray to God for tho&s;e &s;piritual aids, that will enable us to oppo&s;e this tempter and &s;et him at de|fiance: it is what God expects of us, and what, as good men, we are bound to do, that in flying from one &s;in, we &s;hould be careful not to plunge into another. In &s;hunning prodigality, we &s;hould not become covetous; and in avoiding covetou&s;ne&s;s, we &s;hould beware of prodigality. So again, in &s;triving to be humble, we &s;hould not be mean; and in &s;tudying to pre&s;erve a proper dignity, we &s;hould not be proud.

<P>THE object of this maxim is to teach circum|&s;pection, and to <HI>do nothing ra&s;hly.</HI> Indeed, as few things, when done, can be undone, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider well before we do them, as afterwards it may be too late to remedy them. This holds good in every &s;tep in life, but the
<PB N="114" REF="124">painter has thought proper to point it out more particularly in that mo&s;t important of all &s;teps, matrimony. Without circum&s;pection here, the remainder of our lives mu&s;t be embittered, and we &s;hall have rea&s;on to repent our ra&s;hne&s;s, as long as we live.</P>
<P>There are a number of requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the happine&s;s of a married &s;tate, and &s;o much is it the intere&s;t of either man or woman, to conceal, from the objects of their choice, their tempers and &s;ituation in life, if they will not bear examination, that it is wonderful there are not more unhappy marriages than there are. It is truly a leap in the dark, and a mere matter of chance, whether they leap &s;afely or not. The pa&s;&s;ions of youth are too ungovernable to give way to en|quiry; and attachments once formed, are often too &s;trong to be broke through. It would be wi&s;e therefore, if young folks, (&s;hould their inclina|tions lead them to &s;eek a partner for life) would advi&s;e with their parents, or neare&s;t relations, in a concern &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s. Love is an idle term; it is merely the fever of the mind, and, if encouraged, is apt to rage; but, if di&s;couraged, may be overcome: di&s;tre&s;s will &s;oon cool it, for, when <HI>Poverty comes in at the door, Love will fly
<PB N="115" REF="125">out at the window.</HI> In &s;hort, as there can be no true happine&s;s without a competence, this is the fir&s;t con&s;ideration; and, as an enquiry of this kind, is generally beyond the reach of young minds, who &s;o proper to con&s;ult as our parents, or be&s;t friends, who can have no view in the advice they give, but the welfare of tho&s;e they advi&s;e? Per|&s;ons conver&s;ant in life, and acquainted with the world, are certainly be&s;t able to judge in matters of this kind; and if we are wi&s;e, we &s;hall abide by their determinations. If the character, tem|per, and &s;ituation of the object is found, upon a &s;trict enquiry, to be &s;uch as to make an alliance with for life, prudent, pur&s;ue your inclination; but if they turn out the rever&s;e, &s;hun the con|nexion as you would a pe&s;tilence, and, not like a &s;illy moth, flutter round the flame of a candle, till you burn your wings.

<P>Let us, however, not only be circum&s;pect in this, but in every undertaking in which we em|bark. The man who thinks before he acts, is mo&s;t likely to act with di&s;cretion, and have no future cau&s;e to repent of his conduct; but he who acts blindly, without any fore&s;ight, will probably

Where can be their pride, when they are liable to be dragged from their coach, as in the next print, by the hands of a bailiff, and locked up in a jail? And where can be their feel|ing, when perhaps they owe their finery and their indulgences to the labour of tho&s;e who are poorer than them&s;elves; when they are beholden to a taylor and a &s;hoe-maker for their dre&s;s, and to the butcher and baker for their daily food? Surely a man in &s;uch a &s;ituation has little to boa&s;t of; much le&s;s to enable him to rai&s;e his head above tho&s;e trade&s;men, who perhaps are abundantly richer than him&s;elf, far more independent, and of cour&s;e, more re&s;pectable characters.</P>
<P>If a man would confine his wants and wi&s;hes to the bounds of his income, and never think of pur|cha&s;ing a thing till he has the money to pay for it; his money would go much farther, and he might walk abroad and enjoy liberty, without the fear of in&s;ult, or the danger of being taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>I will further ob&s;erve upon this &s;ubject, that to the di&s;grace of the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, there are a number of what are called petty-fogging attornies, or unprincipled profe&s;&s;ors of it, that, when they

<P>THE painter has continued on his la&s;t &s;cene and given us a &s;ketch of the con&s;equences of being in debt. Here now is your gentleman, that man of rank and di&s;tinction, who exalts him&s;elf above his fellow-citizens; and, becau&s;e he can have a little more credit, has more impudence; holds his head up, and looks down on the common
<PB N="126" REF="136">cla&s;s of mankind with contempt! He rides in his coach, is dre&s;&s;ed in velvet, and con&s;iders him|&s;elf as an ennobled being, forgetting at the &s;ame time, that he owes the&s;e appendages of his greatne&s;s, perhaps, to the good-nature and credulity of his coach-maker and his taylor. <Q>How are the mighty fallen!</Q> The time of payment comes round, he has it not to pay, the laws of his country are put in force again&s;t him, a ruffian officer is employed to enforce the&s;e laws, he is dragged by the collar from his coach to repent his indi&s;cretion within the walls of a pri&s;on and iron bars, and his poor coachman left to repent his ma&s;ter's mi&s;|fortune, the downfal of pride, and the lo&s;s of his place.</P>
<P>Let the di&s;&s;ipated man of fa&s;hion view this pic|ture, and &s;ay, in what his fancied dignity con&s;i&s;ts. If there is any human di&s;grace, if there is any contemptible &s;ituation, it is this; and every man who will pre&s;ume to run in debt, and has not the money to pay that debt, when called on, is liable to this indignity: his coachman is in a far happier &s;ituation, and much more re&s;pectable in life, being in no danger of &s;uch an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>But this is only a &s;equel of the la&s;t Proverb, <HI>Out of Debt out, of Danger;</HI> the proverbial expre&s;&s;ion before us, <HI>All is not Gold that Glitters,</HI> has a dif|ferent
<PB N="127" REF="137">allu&s;ion, and the painter is happy in de|&s;cribing both in the &s;ame &s;cene. Appearances are deceitful, we cannot tru&s;t to them; many an ach|ing heart has been concealed under a laced gar|ment, and many a troubled mind has rolled in a gilded chariot. Before we &s;urvey the &s;ituation of tho&s;e apparently above us, let us con&s;ider the ap|pearance well, and &s;ee whether there is any thing in it truly enviable. I will take upon me to &s;ay that he who enjoys the nece&s;&s;aries of life, with &s;ome few of its comforts, in a &s;tate of independency, is a far happier man than he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every luxury, at the expence of his peace of mind.</P>
<P>When any man is di&s;contented with his &s;ituation in life, let him compare it with that of others; let him con&s;ider whether tho&s;e riches, that rank and power which many enjoy, do not carry more tor|ments with them, than real happine&s;s; and let us al&s;o look into the &s;ituation of tho&s;e below us, and &s;ee, whether we are not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many com|forts which others want; others, perhaps, who have had better expectations in life, and are more de|&s;erving than our&s;elves. This &s;hould &s;urely prevent us from repining at our own misfortunes, and make us thankful to Providence for the ble&s;&s;ings he has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us. True happine&s;s
<PB N="128" REF="138">is &s;eated in the mind, and within every one's reach If our fortune is not adequate to our wi&s;hes, let us confine our wi&s;hes to our fortune. Let us make the be&s;t of our &s;ituation, and not lo&s;e the enjoyments of the pre&s;ent moment, in looking forward to the future; that future may never arrive, and if it does, it will bring with it an equal &s;hare of bitter|ne&s;s. Let us learn then, as St. Paul teaches us, <Q>in whatever &s;tate we are, therewith to be con|tent;</Q> and let us remember, that however envi|able a more exalted &s;tate of life may appear, there is no &s;tate but what has its attendant ca&s;es, and that <HI>All is not Gold that Glitters.</HI></P>

<P>Look abroad in life, and you will ob&s;erve a &s;et of weak, young men, who are always talking of them&s;elves and their own unimportant affairs.

<P>But the chief end of this Proverb, and which the painter particularly alludes to, is vain boa&s;ting. Under this interpretation of it, we are taught not to make our&s;elves a laughing-&s;tock, by boa&s;ting of virtues we never practi&s;e, of courage we never

If a man boa&s;ts of virtues, believe him a ra&s;cal; if he vaunts of abilities, be a&s;&s;ured he had none; and if he brags of courage, my life for it, he is a coward. See the vain boa&s;ter be|fore us. This Quixote has cloathed him&s;elf in armour, in order to perform wonderful atchieve|ments; he blu&s;ters and makes a great noi&s;e, and all to what purpo&s;e? Merely to wage war with the pigs; and who, like him, will &s;queak before they are hurt. To &s;hew us the natural di&s;po&s;ition of this &s;waggerer, the de&s;igner has introduced a drum, the &s;ymbol of empty noi&s;e, and has made Folly, on a lamp-po&s;t, &s;taying his up-lifted &s;word, with a pair of taylor's &s;heers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taylors are ludicrou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to have le&s;s courage than other men; not de&s;ervedly &s;o, but, we apprehend, from their feminine profe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whatever our preten&s;ions are, if we are mo|de&s;t and &s;ilent on the matter, we &s;hall &s;tand in more credit with our acquaintance. The mode&s;t and diffident, that is, he who withdraws him|&s;elf from public notice, ri&s;es in e&s;teem on the

<P>In a word, if we wi&s;h to &s;tand well with our friends, to enjoy their confidence, and merit their e&s;teem, we have only to &s;hew our worth by our actions.

<P>Do we not, in almo&s;t all the occurrences of life, find, that <HI>when the Child is Chri&s;tened we may have God-fathers enough?</HI>&mdash;For when our nece&s;&s;ities are relieved&mdash;when we no longer require aid&mdash;we &s;hall have many offers; but, if like Gay's Hare in the fable, we apply to our acquaintance in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our of need, we &s;hall find them, like her many

<Q>From who&s;e bourne no traveller returns.</Q>

A few days only before, the &s;olicitous parent, anxious to be&s;tow the fir&s;t token of chri&s;tianity on his darling infant, a&s;ked his fal&s;e friends to become its &s;pon&s;ors. No; like the per&s;ons, in the parable, invited to the fea&s;t, they made various excu&s;es; but no &s;ooner do they &s;ee the bu&s;ine&s;s done, and their &s;ervices not required, than they come forth voluntarily, and tender what they till then refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are other little emblems in this picture. By the trees, in full leaf, adjoining the church, the painter would tell us, that the doctrines of religion are wide expanded to afford us &s;helter; that much
<PB N="136" REF="146">depends upon our&s;elves; and that if we cultivate our under&s;tandings, and bring them to that full perfection the trees are arrived at, we &s;hall have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our moral and religious duties; and they will bring forth that fruit that will &s;ecure, not only our temporal, but our eternal, happine&s;s. The infant in the left arm of its mother, and next the mini&s;ter, the delegate of Heaven, emphatically &s;peaks, and &s;ays that our hearts &s;hould ever turn to God; it tells us too, that the child &s;hould never turn its face again&s;t its parent. The hone&s;t con|tempt the father &s;hews, for offers un&s;olicited, for &s;ervices he does not need, teaches us not to credit the &s;incerity of tho&s;e, who, in the time of our pro&s;perity, &s;hall tender kindne&s;&s;es they at other times refu&s;e; or conceive every one to be our friend who &s;peaks to us fairly, or makes us pro|mi&s;es.

<P>THE de&s;ign of this Proverb is to condemn every kind of hurry; expedition is nece&s;&s;ary upon all occa&s;ions, for "delays are dangerous," but, ha&s;te or hurry is not the way to be expeditious. The painter, in the de&s;ign before us, &s;hews us evidently, that he who goes &s;oftly, goes &s;ure, and
<PB N="138" REF="148">al&s;o far; but he that &s;purs on too fa&s;t, at fir&s;t &s;etting out, either falls by the way, or tires before he comes to his journey's end. The old man here trotting to market, is mo&s;t likely to reach it &s;ooner than he who &s;ets out on a gallop. As the French &s;ay, He who walks too ha&s;tily, often &s;tumbles in a plain way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui trop &s;e-ha&s;te en cheminent, en beau chemin &s;e tour voye &s;ouvent.</NOTE>; &s;o he who rides as fa&s;t as his hor&s;e can go, is more likely to fall than one who goes gently on: for "a whet is no let," &s;ay the mowers, in giving a fre&s;h edge to their &s;cythes.</P>
<P>But, this Proverb may be otherwi&s;e con&s;trued. By the age of the hor&s;e and its rider, it appears that they have jogged on together through life, in an even, gentle way, and have, of cour&s;e, been free from tho&s;e accidents that attend the wild and im|petuous. Nothing &s;hould be done ha&s;tily, &s;ays another Proverb, but killing of fleas; for if we make the lea&s;t delay here, they e&s;cape us.</P>
<P>He who does things in a hurry, never thinks; and without thought, it cannot be well done; for accord|ing to the Italians, Ha&s;tily and well never meet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;to et bene non &s;i conviene.</NOTE>. A man of &s;en&s;e may be expeditious, but is never in
<PB N="139" REF="149">a hurry; convinced that hurry is the &s;ure&s;t way to make him do, what he undertakes, ill: he may do it wrong, and have it to begin a-fre&s;h; which a little con&s;ideration might have prevented. To be in a hurry is a proof that the bu&s;ine&s;s we embark in, is too great for us; of cour&s;e, it is the mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when they &s;hould be &s;low and deliberate; wi&s;hing to do every thing at once, they are able to do nothing. <Q>Tarry a little, that we may make an end the &s;ooner,</Q> was a &s;aying of Sir Amias Paulet; and <HI>Fe&s;tina lente,</HI> or On &s;low, is the motto of the On&s;low arms.</P>
<P>Let us be &s;teady then in all things we under|take; con&s;ider the bu&s;ine&s;s well, before we begin, and remember, that we had better do half of them well, and leave the re&s;t undone, than do the whole indifferently.

Wa&s;te, Want and Strife. Wa&s;te is the father of many evils; Want is the mother of many more; and Strife, their offspring, engen|ders

If then you would guard again&s;t the effect, remove the cau&s;e. Remember, that great rivers proceed from &s;mall &s;prings, and great vices often originate in little errors. Think before you act.

Hence aro&s;e the Proverb, <HI>"Tell me what company you keep, and I will tell you who you are."</HI></P>
<P>As men covet the e&s;teem of each other; it is incumbent on all, to be careful, not to give man|kind a bad impre&s;&s;ion of us; for a good character is &s;ooner lo&s;t than gained. The world is apt to judge of us from the company we keep; if then we would be thought well off, let us pick that company, and never be &s;een to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who are de&s;pi&s;ed. I have &s;een religious men &s;o &s;crupulous in this point, that they would not be &s;een even &s;peaking to a wicked man, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed they approved of his evil actions. In|deed, if men were nicer in this re&s;pect than they are, it would go a great way towards reforming the world; for, if bad men were not admitted into the &s;ociety of the virtuous, it would be a greater puni&s;hment than any penalties enacted by law.</P>
<P>The allu&s;ion of this Proverb might be carried &s;till further; as a man who is often &s;een in low company, will find an acce&s;s to better very diffi|cult; &s;uch as are ambitious of keeping good com|pany, &s;hould never mix with any below them:
<PB N="143" REF="153">when I &s;ay <HI>never,</HI> I do not ay, on no occa&s;ion whatever, this perhaps our connections in life may render almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, but I mean, that to be well received in the be&s;t of company, a man mu&s;t not <HI>a&s;&s;ociate</HI> with the lower. By low company, I mean low in birth, low in rank, low in parts, and low in manners; that company, who in&s;ignificant and con|temptible in them&s;elves, are proud of being &s;een with <HI>you,</HI> and who will flatter your very vices, in order to keep in with you.</P>
<P>The vanity of being reckoned the fir&s;t per&s;on in company, has led many a young gentleman to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e per&s;ons who have degraded him, and even prevented his being received into better a&s;&s;emblies. Every one &s;hould be ambitious of im|proving his mind, and getting forward in life; and this is not to be done, by mixing with people be|low our&s;elves. Depend upon it, a man &s;inks or ri&s;es, according to the level of the company he keeps.</P>
<P>What is the &s;cene before us but riot, revelry, and drunkenne&s;s? Such per&s;ons who&s;e minds are ill|di&s;po&s;ed to thought and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;eek relief from them&s;elves in mu&s;ic, cards, and riot; and whil&s;t they thus think to &s;pend their idle hours agreeably, they involve them&s;elves in penury and wretchedne&s;s, and bring on &s;ickne&s;s and ill health; and once inured to
<PB N="144" REF="154">this way of life, they enjoy no other, but return like a dog to his vomit. The painter has given us to under&s;tand, that &s;uch a life is a departure from virtue, and brought about by the Enemy of mankind, by &s;hewing us, that though the&s;e men have &s;at up late, burnt out their light, and drank more than they can contain, he is &s;purring them on to a farther exce&s;s of bea&s;tline&s;s, and putting the bell into the hand of the drunkard, to ring for more liquor; thus filling up the mea&s;ure of their iniquity.</P>
<P>Beware then of bad company; &s;hun them as you would a pe&s;tilence; and remember, that if you would avoid evil, a&s;&s;ociate not with evil doers. A good character is &s;ooner lo&s;t than gained. Be your principles what they will, they are liable to be infected; and if you would not be thought vicious, keep no vicious company; for the cen&s;ure of the world will be &s;ure to fall on you if you do, from an opinion that you mu&s;t be of the &s;ame &s;tamp with the company you keep, as <HI>Birds of a Feather, Flock together.</HI></P>

By his repre&s;enting the centinel a&s;leep, he would teach us the con&s;equence likely to re&s;ult from his drow&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;what ills may ari&s;e from inattention to tho&s;e duties with which we are entru&s;ted. By his negligence, the means given to di&s;charge his office, are rendered u&s;ele&s;s. The key which &s;ecured the pri&s;oners, is wre&s;ted from him, and lies at his feet, and he &s;leeps upon the loaded mu&s;quet and fixed bayonet,
<PB N="147" REF="157">weapons put into his hands, to guard again&s;t tho&s;e very &s;teps his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s has &s;uffered to be com|mitted.</P>
<P>The ill-judged doubts which the inattentive have of this Proverb, is repre&s;ented in the coun|tenance of the pri&s;oners, who &s;eem to he&s;itate whether they &s;hall make hay, although the &s;un &s;hines, or e&s;cape, though the centinel &s;leeps; though the birds on flight direct their way, and contra&s;t the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and free air, with <Q>durance vile, and &s;ad contagion,</Q> and though if they avail not them&s;elves of the pre&s;ent opportunity, another may never offer, and they may repent they mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>We learn from this Proverb al&s;o, a piece of worldly policy, to find out the moments of in&s;inu|ation, the <HI>mollia t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra fandi,</HI> the &s;oft hours of per&s;wa&s;ion, when we are be&s;t likely to &s;ucceed with tho&s;e to whom we apply. If we wi&s;h to &s;peak with efficacy, and make an impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e we &s;peak to, we &s;hould &s;elect tho&s;e moments when they are be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to us, and when what we &s;ay, is mo&s;t likely to be attended to. Our application then will probably not be fruitle&s;s, and we &s;hall profit by the wi&s;dom. Upon this prin|ciple, we &s;hould not talk of patience to enraged men, or religion to a drunken man; but wait till
<PB N="148" REF="158">favourable opportunities offer, and embrace tho&s;e opportunities when they do.</P>
<P>In a religious &s;en&s;e, this Proverb teaches not to defer our repentance. Man is naturally a &s;inner, prone to &s;in, as the &s;parks fly upwards; and as &s;inners cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven, without repentance; repentance is nece&s;&s;ary to our future happine&s;s. Young per&s;ons, unwilling to mor|tify them&s;elves, and break off from habits they find a plea&s;ure in, po&s;tpone their repentance to a future day, and idly think, it will be time enough to re|form when they grow old in life. This perhaps might do, if they were certain of living to be old. But what if they are cut off the next year, the next month, or the next day?&mdash;What becomes of their repentance then?&mdash;They die with all their &s;ins upon their heads, and ru&s;h into futurity, to meet the vengeance of an angry God.&mdash;How unwi&s;e this!&mdash;Repent then in time. Attend to the voice of Heaven: <Q>To <HI>day,</HI> if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</Q> A good life is equally plea&s;ant as a bad one, and is the be&s;t of comforts when we come to die. Lo&s;e not then the pre&s;ent opportunity; avail your&s;elf of the hours now in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Catch the moments as they fly. Be not regardle&s;s of the indulgence of Providence, and <HI>Make Hay whil&s;t the Sun &s;hines.</HI></P>

And although Canute la&s;hed the waves for wetting his feet, not all their power could rever&s;e the cour&s;e of nature. The&s;e mighty kings are now crumbled with the du&s;t.

<P>Know then, that each revolving &s;un brings us hearer to our end; and as on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and in the la&s;t extremity of expiring nature, we cannot &s;tay the hand of Death, or prolong the time of our exi&s;tence; and as the hours we lo&s;e are pa&s;t recall, how much does it behove us, e'er our gla&s;s is run, to employ our hours well; that when Time &s;hall cut us down, and the tide roll its waters over

<P>CHILDREN, becau&s;e from their tender age they &s;tudy nothing but to promote their little plea&s;ures; and fools, becau&s;e their ignorance puts them beyond the reach of rational enjoyments, are merry at trifles, and &s;trangers to reflection.</P>
<P>The Proverb means to &s;ay, that fools, though of full age, are little wi&s;er than children, who for want
<PB N="154" REF="164">of thought and rea&s;on, never look forward, but enjoy the pre&s;ent moment; labouring to bani&s;h re|flection by low mirth, and excite laughter from tho&s;e as ignorant as them&s;elves. Children then, thus compared to fools, mu&s;t &s;ee the folly of their conduct. Though they may bur&s;t into roars of laughter, at ten or twelve years of age, at the low buffooneries of a droll;&mdash;though they may lead very merry lives before the &s;en&s;e of care breaks in upon them, yet when they come to years of di&s;cre|tion, and &s;ee things in a different light, they &s;hould act quite otherwi&s;e. St. Paul &s;ays, <Q>When I was a child, I thought as a child, I &s;pake as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h things.</Q></P>
<P>The concerns and anxieties of life will naturally intrude upon our plea&s;ures, and checquer our hap|pine&s;s with a degree of pain. And it is wi&s;e and allowable, to enjoy the moments as they pa&s;s, and not &s;uffer the pro&s;pect of a <HI>future</HI> plea&s;ure, to rob us of the <HI>pre&s;ent;</HI> for that future pro&s;pect may never be realized.</P>
<P><Q>The thing that hath <HI>been,</HI> it is that which &s;hall <HI>be;</HI> and that which <HI>is</HI> done, is that which <HI>&s;hall</HI> be done; for there is nothing <HI>new</HI> under the &s;un.</Q> None but fools then will mi&s;s the enjoyment in their

As real and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s de|pends upon peace of mind, and as there can be no &s;uch peace, where there is no plea&s;ing reflection; children, as their rea&s;on opens, and as reflection offers it&s;elf, &s;hould lay that foundation of future happine&s;s in their own brea&s;ts, as will &s;ecure them comfort and a tranquil old age; that is, they &s;hould attend to the in&s;tructions they receive from their parents and teachers, per&s;ons who know better than them&s;elves; and not by a fooli&s;h indifference to every thing &s;erious, and an idle attachment to folly and mirth, create temporary joy, at the expence of la&s;ting comfort, and all that is prai&s;e-worthy. We &s;hould con&s;ider that our days roll on, that every additional year brings with it its cares; that we may be thrown on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, even in early life; that our &s;pirits will flag at repetitions of in|con&s;iderate and immoderate plea&s;ures; and of cour&s;e, that we &s;hould conduct our&s;elves &s;o, whil&s;t we have the power of doing it, that reflection may not wound us, when that power is no more. The gra&s;shopper, in the fable, on the approach of win|ter, begged the Ant to lend her a few grains of corn, "What," a&s;ked the provident ant, <Q>did you do all the &s;ummer, that you are without food now?</Q> "Sung," replied the gra&s;shopper, <Q>well

<P>IT is the di&s;grace of the inhabitants of this country, that of all others, they are mo&s;t ad|dicted to intemperance: I mean not exce&s;s in drinking, but exce&s;s in eating; &s;o that it is almo&s;t grown into a Proverb, that Engli&s;hmen dig their graves with their teeth. I have had occa&s;ion to
<PB N="158" REF="168">&s;hew the folly and wickedne&s;s of drunkenne&s;s, which is intemperance in drinking, and to &s;ay &s;omething of gluttony, which is exce&s;s in eating; but this Proverb bears another complexion, and points out to us that gluttony not only brings on di&s;ea&s;e, but that he who &s;tudies his palate, &s;hortens his days. Nature is &s;oon &s;atisfied; and we &s;ee in ru&s;tic life, that where men feed upon homely food, and are obliged, from their poverty, to put up with &s;canty fare; they are generally in better health and &s;pirits, and, in reality, more happy than tho&s;e, who&s;e wealth enables them to indulge their appetites, at the expence of their con&s;titution; for &s;urfeiting and di&s;ea&s;es often attend full tables.</P>
<P>The painter, &s;en&s;ible of this, has given us a view of the con&s;equence of intemperance. A wealthy citizen blown up with corpulency, choaked for want of breath, and racked with the excruci|ating pains of the gout, not only in his feet, but in his &s;tomach. The agony he feels is painted in his countenance: he is become unweildy through want of exerci&s;e; and to gratify a greedy appetite, has lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs; of cour&s;e, confined to the melancholy reflection of having been his own tormentor. We are taught, by the picture above, repre&s;enting a man eager in weighing his
<PB N="159" REF="169">money, that he has been anxious in the accumula|tion of that, which he has converted to very bad purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I am convinced that exce&s;s in eating has done as much harm, if not more, in &s;ociety, than exce&s;s in drinking. A cheerful gla&s;s of wine, if not taken to intoxication, that is, if it does not make a man drunk, and deprive him of the command of his rea&s;on, often exhilerates the &s;pirits and comforts the con&s;titution; and under this conception, phy|&s;icians have frequently pre&s;cribed the cheerful u&s;e of wine, or to drink occa&s;ionally a little more than we have been u&s;ed to; but they never thought of advi&s;ing a &s;ick man to over-eat him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If loading the appetite dulls the under&s;tanding, makes a man heavy, &s;leepy, and inactive, and unfits him for the purpo&s;es of &s;ociety, it incapacitates him for bu&s;ine&s;s, and indi&s;po&s;es him for exerci&s;e. Want of exerci&s;e brings on corpulency, with all the inconveniences of repletion and foulne&s;s, and the con&s;equence is a complication of di&s;ea&s;es, tor|ture of body, and an untimely death. Be a&s;&s;ured, if a man finds him&s;elf unwell, that temperance is his be&s;t phy&s;ician, and exerci&s;e his be&s;t nur&s;e. Let him keep regular hours, never feed but when he is hungry, eat &s;paringly, drink moderately, and u&s;e
<PB N="160" REF="170">proper exerci&s;e, and he may throw phy&s;ic to the dogs. But if he makes u&s;e of his money to pam|per his appetite, he not only puni&s;hes him&s;elf in this world, but runs the ri&s;k of being puni&s;hed in the next; for gluttons and drunkards are included in that li&s;t of &s;inners, who, without repentance, will be &s;hut out from Heaven.</P>
<P>Di&s;orders brought on by our&s;elves, are unpitied; a great eater is con&s;idered as little better than a mon&s;ter, and he who ran&s;acks the creation to gra|tify his palate, is not only the deri&s;ion of all who know him, but becomes his own executioner; is a &s;elf-murderer in the eye of Heaven, and falls un|pitied and unlamented. In a word, if a man un|well mu&s;t con&s;ult phy&s;icians, I beg leave to recom|mend Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet, and Dr. Merryman, <HI>Haec tria, mens laeta, requies, moderata diaeta</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e three, a happy mind, quiet, and moderate diet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the three be&s;t phy&s;icians in the world; for intemperance only brings on di&s;ca&s;e, and <HI>much Meat, much Maladies.</HI></P>

<P>THIS is one of tho&s;e Proverbs which they who make allowances and undertake to account for the depravity of mankind, u&s;e in their behalf, attributing the di&s;hone&s;ty of men to the truly hone&s;t man will avail him&s;elf of no oppor|tunity
<PB N="162" REF="172">to do an improper act. Convinced he is under the eye of Heaven, he will act, as if the eyes of Mankind were upon him, and be afraid to com|mit him&s;elf, or do by another, what he would be unwilling any one &s;hould do by him.</P>
<P>The painter, however, has fallen in with the humour of the world, and has &s;hewn us that oppor|tunity here has made a thief; for whil&s;t a gentleman is &s;leeping in his garden, a ra&s;cal has turned his pockets in&s;ide out, robbed him of his money, and is carrying off his hat and wig, his &s;word and his cane.</P>
<P>If the di&s;hone&s;ty of men can ever be attributed to opportunity, it mu&s;t be opportunity accompa|nied with nece&s;&s;ity. We can ea&s;ily make allow|ances for the frailty of human nature, when nece&s;|&s;ity pu&s;hes hard; and if a poor, fami&s;hed wretch pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, &s;hould &s;ee a piece of bread lie in his way, and an opportunity offer to take it, unob&s;erved, where he knew it would not be given him, on a&s;king for it, I &s;ay, it would require, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, more than human exertion, to with|&s;tand the temptation, and a feeling man would pardon the infirmity; but it does not follow that &s;uch an act is ju&s;tifiable. The laws of this country have pointed out where &s;uch a man may &s;eek re|lief,
<PB N="163" REF="173">and, of cour&s;e, will always puni&s;h the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>A prudent man, however, will be careful not to lay temptation in the way of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;itua|tions in life, might urge them to fall in with them; that is to &s;ay, ma&s;ters, &s;uperiors, and hou&s;ekeepers &s;hould &s;ecure their money and move|able goods under lock and key, that their &s;ervants may have no temptation to &s;teal. <HI>Safe Bind, &s;afe Find.</HI> He who &s;ecures his property, is in little dan|ger of lo&s;ing it; but he who leaves it at the mercy of others, mu&s;t not always expect to find it undi|mini&s;hed.</P>
<P>But this Proverb may, in its allu&s;ions, be carried further: we may from hence learn the dangers of opportunity, in other ca&s;es than that of theft. Wherever opportunities hold forth temptation, we &s;hould always avoid them: we &s;hould &s;hun the company of bad men, and bad women, le&s;t the opportunities this may afford, &s;hould induce us to follow their example. Opportunities of drinking and revelling may make a drunkard of a &s;ober man; and opportunities of debauchery, may make a libertine of a mode&s;t one.&mdash;Our pa&s;&s;ions natu|rally incline us to evil; and as few men can tho|roughly
<PB N="164" REF="174">&s;ubdue their pa&s;&s;ion and inclinations, it is advi&s;eable to avoid the temptation.</P>
<P>On this con&s;ideration, it is incumbent on all who have the care of youth, never to &s;lip an opportunity to amend their morals: they &s;hould never give them an opportunity to corrupt them, but keep them out of harm's way; and young folks &s;hould reflect, that when parents and guar|dians abridge them of what they call plea&s;ures, it is done with a view to their welfare, which their infant-under&s;tandings will not enable them to &s;ee into. For occa&s;ions of temptation tend as much to corrupt the morals, as <HI>Opportunity</HI> does to <HI>make the Thief.</HI></P>

<P>THE de&s;ign of this Proverb, is to teach men moderation, and &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of co|veting more than they want. When hunger is &s;a|tisfied, even the &s;ight of meat is di&s;gu&s;ting. <HI>Little difference between a Fea&s;t and a Belly-full;</HI> and when our inclinations are gratified, what more can we need? "Take no thought," &s;ays our Sa|viour,
<PB N="170" REF="180">"for to-morrow, what you &s;hall eat, or what you &s;hall drink, or wherewithal you &s;hall be cloathed; for the morrow &s;hall take thought for the things of it&s;elf." This advice of our Lord, &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, with the Proverb, to contradict that carefull provi&s;ion which every prudent man &s;hould make for him&s;elf and his family, in laying by &s;ome|thing again&s;t an evil day, &s;o as to protect him and his from future want; but his meaning is merely to condemn that carking care which &s;ome fearful men are continually troubled with, and which pre|vents their pre&s;ent enjoyments. By the <HI>enough</HI> of the worldly man is under&s;tood a little more than he has; but the <HI>enough</HI> here alluded to, implies that provi&s;ion &s;ufficient, with hone&s;t indu&s;try, to enable a man to &s;upport him&s;elf and his family; not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at avaritious &s;craping together that knows no bounds, and that renders us churli&s;h and unfeeling to the wants of others. Ambition is like a ladder, where, a man having got upon one round, is di&s;|contented till he reaches the top, and, is then un|happy that he can go no higher.</P>
<P>The painter has here given us a picture of a &s;hepherd family, who, having &s;atisfied their own hunger, are giving the remainder to a pauper at their door, convinced that what they have to di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="181">of is lent to the Lord, and will be returned them in time of need.</P>
<P>Could the unfeeling wretch, who withholds a good office from a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed object, when he has it in his power to perform one; I &s;ay, could he but be &s;en&s;ible of the heart-felt plea&s;ure, the beneficent man enjoys within him&s;elf, at having fed the hun|gry, cloathed the naked, and made the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy, he would wonder at his want of nature, repine at his inhumanity, and would truly abhor him&s;elf. There is certainly a greater plea&s;ure in giving than receiving; but, indepen|dant of this plea&s;ure, it is the duty of all men to do good where they can, and be&s;tow a part of their income in charitable acts. Let no one &s;uppo&s;e, that what he gives to the poor is thrown away; for God will ble&s;s his acts of beneficence, and, for every guinea he thus be&s;tows, will give him two in return. It is to the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence that we owe what we have, and he who gave us that can give us more; that is to &s;ay, he will pro&s;per our labours, di&s;po&s;e the minds of men in our fa|vour, and put us in a &s;ituation to improve our for|tune.</P>
<P>But the great doctrine of the Proverb is to teach us, with St. Paul, "to be contented in that &s;tate
<PB N="172" REF="182">in which Providence has placed us," to enjoy tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings God has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on us, and not covet tho&s;e out of our reach; and, like the dog and the &s;hadow, lo&s;e a pre&s;ent comfort, in &s;earching for a future one.

It is idle and boyi&s;h: our life is very &s;hort, and pa&s;&s;es away very imperceptibly; and the only true happine&s;s, is a quiet mind, and the peaceable enjoyment of the pre&s;ent moment. Riches bring with them, trouble and care; and in coveting more than we want, we wi&s;h for anxieties, that would load and oppre&s;s us.

<P>THIS Proverb figuratively implies, that cou|rage and per&s;everance are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to effect any end we may have in view, and is, by no means, confined to the literal &s;en&s;e; for, as <HI>a faint heart never won fair lady,</HI> &s;o cowardice and &s;upinene&s;s, will infallibly produce a failure in the accompli&s;hment of any other purpo&s;e we may aim

If it is not likely to produce this good effect, we &s;hould give up the attempt; but if, on the contrary, we find it may prove in&s;trumental to either of them, let us pu&s;h forward with an hone&s;t zeal, with a &s;pirited re&s;olution, remembering that, <HI>nothing Venture, nothing Have.</HI></P>
<P>The proverb teaches us, al&s;o, never to de&s;pair, never to relax in our endeavours to perform a good action,&mdash;never to have a faint heart in laudable pur&s;uits;&mdash;for, though per&s;everance, even in a good cau&s;e, is not always victorious,&mdash;though we can|not <HI>command</HI> &s;ucce&s;s, we may do more&mdash;we may &s;tudy to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it. Virtue has a &s;ure reward, though it may be a late one. The practice of vir|tue will ever afford a &s;erene pro&s;pect, a la&s;ting happine&s;s, far beyond the glittering per&s;pectives, the momentary tran&s;ports of delu&s;ive vice. It is &s;urely natural for an hone&s;t man to pur&s;ue, with an anxious alacrity, tho&s;e purpo&s;es that are worthy of him; to pre&s;erve, throughout, a con&s;i&s;tent per&s;e|verence; not to be frightened by ideal ob&s;tacles, or, "make mountains of mole-hills."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="185">But to apply the Proverb&mdash;Perhaps it will be difficult to find a more &s;ignificant allu&s;ion, than the one here adopted.

Mo&s;t other de&s;ires have their ri&s;e from the prejudice of education; but this derives its birth from nature. Though the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of mankind is a thir&s;t for gain, yet this often leads to the perver&s;ion of honour, virtue, and goodne&s;s; whereas, the one we are &s;peaking of confirms them all.</P>
<P>Let us under&s;tand, then, that the per&s;everance recommended, is only in tho&s;e pur&s;uits, which, when overtaken, will repay our labour with placid &s;atisfaction; and will afford us plea&s;ure on con|templation.

<PB N="178" REF="188">with impunity. We have a &s;ignal in&s;tance of this in the &s;tory to which our print alludes.</P>
<P>A traveller, who &s;trolled into a church-yard, to pa&s;s the time, whil&s;t his dinner was preparing at the inn, took notice of a human &s;kull, which a grave-digger had thrown out with the earth, in digging a grave. Whil&s;t his eye was upon it, it moved, a toad having crawled under it. This cir|cum&s;tance called his attention farther, and he per|ceived the remains of a ru&s;ty nail, &s;ticking fa&s;t in one of the temples. He took up the &s;kull, ex|amined it, and was then led to conceive, that this nail had occa&s;ioned the death of the man to whom it once belonged. He a&s;ked the grave-digger, who had long been employed in that office, and grown old in his profe&s;&s;ion, whether he knew who&s;e &s;kull that was, or who had been buried in that grave. The old man, who&s;e knowledge of the pari&s;h reached but to all its inhabitants, and who could tell from father to &s;on, where this man lay, and that man was buried, informed the tra|veller, that he had not opened this grave for ma|ny years, and that he believed the &s;kull he had now thrown out belonged to a man who, on a journey, about twenty years ago, died at the adjoining Inn. He died &s;uddenly, continued the old man;
<PB N="179" REF="189">and from a variety of circum&s;tances, before and after, the ill-natured world charged the landlord with murdering him. Some enquiry was made, but it ended in nothing. God forbid any thing, I may &s;ay, &s;hould hurt his character!&mdash;The man may be innocent.&mdash;The &s;u&s;picion is blown over and he is now re&s;pected.</P>
<P>This &s;tory dwelt with our traveller. He was now more convinced than before, that the nail in the &s;kull occa&s;ioned the man's death, and that he could be no other than murdered. He flew to the Inn, clo&s;etted the landlord, told him what he had &s;een and heard, and charged him with the fact. The man, who&s;e con&s;cience became in&s;tantly his upbraider, and "who&s;e crime," like Cain's, "was more than he was able to bear," with trem|bling and with faultering tongue, confe&s;&s;ed the fact, became his own accu&s;er, and thus &s;uffered for the murder he had committed twenty years before. This inn-keeper having found his gue&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great property, not only robbed him of that pro|perty, but al&s;o his life, by driving a &s;lender nail into his &s;kull within the hair, whil&s;t he was a&s;leep, hoping, by this, that he never &s;hould be di&s;cover|ed: but &s;ooner or later, <HI>Murder will Out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="190">In a le&s;s criminal &s;en&s;e, this Proverb teaches us, not to do wrong through the hopes of its never be|ing di&s;covered.

It is not in the power of any man to cut down a large tree, at one &s;troke of an axe; but let him repeat tho&s;e &s;trokes, and he will accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e.

<P>What more hard than &s;tone, and what le&s;s ea&s;y to be cut? Stone can be &s;awn through by degrees, and chizelled into any form we plea&s;e.

The harde&s;t &s;tone has been hollowed out by drops of water continually falling on it.</P>
<P>Plutarch tells a &s;tory of Sertorius, to this pur|po&s;e. To per&s;uade his &s;oldiers, that under&s;tanding was more available than &s;trength, he cau&s;ed two hor&s;es, with long tails, to be brought out; the one
<PB N="183" REF="193">poor and lean, the other lu&s;ty and &s;trong. To the weak hor&s;e, he &s;ets a &s;tout, &s;trong, young man, and to the &s;trong hor&s;e, a little, weak fellow; each was to pull off his hor&s;e's tail. The young man, catch|ing all the tail at once in his hands, began to tug with all his &s;trength, labouring and &s;weating to little purpo&s;e, till at la&s;t, being tired, he gave it up: whereas, the weak man, with more under|&s;tanding, pulled his hor&s;e's tail, hair by hair, and thus, by per&s;everance, in a little time, got off the whole tail, without much labour; for, according to the Italian proverb, <HI>Feather by Feather, the Goo&s;e is plucked.</HI> In &s;hort, the meaning of the Proverb is, that a&s;&s;iduity overcomes all difficulty.</P>
<P>In another &s;en&s;e, it teaches us, that <HI>Light Gains make a Heavy Pur&s;e;</HI> that is, tho&s;e who &s;ell for &s;mall profit, vend more commodities, and make quicker returns of their money, than tho&s;e who are covetous of gain, and &s;ell their goods at a dearer rate. Indeed, tho&s;e who &s;ell dear, are likely to be lo&s;ers in another way; their goods remain long on hand, and frequently &s;poil and grow out of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Under this &s;en&s;e of the Proverb, we are taught, likewi&s;e, to &s;ave our money, for, as <HI>Little and o&s;ten fills the Pur&s;e,</HI> he who begins to &s;ave, will

<P>In a religious &s;en&s;e, we learn from the &s;cene before us, that per&s;everance in well-doing, is the way to be &s;aved.

<P>In a word, whatever object we may have in view, let us keep our eyes fixed upon it, make u&s;e of the means that are in our power to obtain it, per&s;evere in tho&s;e means, never be di&s;couraged, or give the point up, and we &s;hall gradually accom|pli&s;h our aim.&mdash;Few difficulties are &s;o great as not to be overcome; for <HI>Little &s;trokes fell Great oaks.</HI></P>

<P>Happy is it for &s;uch men, that there is a God above, who often takes compa&s;&s;ion on their weak|ne&s;s, and exerts him&s;elf to bring them back from the error of their ways! He awakens them from

<P>A regular attendance at divine wor&s;hip, is a duty we owe not only to God, but to our&s;elves.

Enjoy, with pru|dence, the comforts and plea&s;ures which your &s;ituation affords; and lo&s;e not &s;ight of pre&s;ent happine&s;s, in hunting after that which is to come.</P>
<P>True happine&s;s is within every one's reach: it does not con&s;i&s;t in wealth and honours, but in a contented mind. If a man has but a competency, he has no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied; for there are thou&s;ands in the world who are not &s;o ble&s;&s;ed, and yet may boa&s;t of equal merit. A great fortune falls not to every man's lot, and yet almo&s;t every man may be rich; for he who has fewe&s;t wants is riche&s;t. And man who has a hundred pounds a-year, and &s;pends but ninety, has ten pounds to &s;pare, and, of cour&s;e, is a rich man; whereas, he who has five thou&s;and pounds a-year, and &s;pends &s;ix thou&s;and, mu&s;t be poor, and embarra&s;&s;ed for money.</P>
<P>Let a man's fortune be ever &s;o &s;mall, if he acts his part in life well, he will be always re&s;pectable. Strive, therefore, to be contented with what you
<PB N="192" REF="202">have, and envy the wealth of no man. Improve your income, if you can, but do it with honour and liberality; and remember the old adage&mdash;<HI>All covet all lo&s;e</HI>&mdash;and the fable of the dog&mdash;<HI>Gra&s;p all Lo&s;e all.</HI></P>
<P>&rindx; See <HI>Enough is as good as a fea&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>WE are here taught to pay a proper regard to our own actions, as every one mu&s;t an|&s;wer for him&s;elf, and "bear his own burden." the French have a Proberb to this effect, "Every one mu&s;t go to the will his own &s;ack; that is, carry his own load him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="204">Whether a man con&s;iders him&s;elf as a member of &s;ociety, or as a Chri&s;tian, he is re&s;pon&s;ible for his own conduct. Human laws will call him to an account in this life, and divine laws in the next.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of this truth, the painter has given us a view of the la&s;t Judgment, when all men will ri&s;e from their graves, and be &s;ummoned before the Almighty, to give an account of them&s;elves; when tho&s;e who have lived a good life on earth, will be rewarded with everla&s;ting happine&s;s; and tho&s;e who have led a wicked life on earth, will be puni&s;hed with eternal mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome ca&s;es, where a man will be obliged to an&s;wer for the conduct of others, but there are none in which he will not be re&s;pon&s;ible for his own. If a man advi&s;es his neighbour to do wrong; if he a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in doing it; if he &s;ees him going to do it, can prevent in and does not; he is not only equally guilty with him who does the wrong, and liable to be puni&s;hed in this life, but will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be called to an account in the next, not only for his own &s;oul, but for that of his neighbour. <HI>The receiver,</HI> &s;ay our laws, <HI>is as bad as the thief;</HI> that is, he who receives &s;tolen goods, knowing them to be &s;tolen, and does not divulge it, is equally liable to be puni&s;hed with
<PB N="195" REF="205">the thief. If &s;uch then be the ca&s;e of things, a man &s;hould be very careful how be commits &s;in, or gives occa&s;ion to others doing it.</P>
<P>But, though he will thus be obliged to an&s;wer for the mi&s;conduct of others, let no one &s;uppo&s;e, that if he is urged to do wrong, the per&s;on urging him will be the only one blamed: it is his duty to avoid the wrong, and not to li&s;ten to ill-advi&s;ers; for, <HI>Every Herring mu&s;t hang by his own Gill,</HI> and every one will be puni&s;hed for his own faults.</P>
<P>Future puni&s;hment is a &s;erious piece of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and, was a man aware of the con&s;equences of a bad life, he would not dare to commit a &s;in. A few years on earth is nothing to the endle&s;s ages of eternity; and he who, to gratify an idle pa&s;&s;ion, or a wicked inclination for a &s;hort time, would ri&s;k the chance of being mi&s;erably wretched for a long futurity, can be no other than a mad|man. On that day of trial, when all men will be called before God and his holy angels, to give an account of their conduct whil&s;t on earth, ex|cu&s;es will &s;tand them in little &s;tead: having been led into &s;in, by con&s;titution, by unruly pa&s;&s;ions, by ill advi&s;ers, by example, by fa&s;hion, by inte|re&s;t or any wordly motive, will be poor and in|effectual pleas. If a man has done well, our Sa|viour,
<PB N="196" REF="206">the judge of all the earth, will welcome him, with a <Q>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</Q> If he has done ill, he will re|ceive the dreadful &s;entence, <Q>Go ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;</Q> for every one will be puni&s;hed or re|warded hereafter, according to his actions here, and <HI>Every Tub mu&s;t &s;tand upon its own Bottom.</HI></P>
