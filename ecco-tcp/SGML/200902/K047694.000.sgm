<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT were an Impo&s;ition on the Town, and an In|ju&s;tice to the Memory of the inimitable <HI>BEN JOHNSON;</HI> &s;hould I publi&s;h this Play, without acknowledging that mo&s;t part of the Plot, &s;ome of the Scenes, and many of the Speeches, are almo&s;t literally copied from a dramatic Work of his, with the &s;ame Title. An Attempt at altering a Piece of his, is, I believe, unprecedented, and indeed bold, for one who never before, either burthen'd the Pre&s;s with his Labours, or dar'd the Critic's Cen&s;ure. I was allur'd to the Ta&s;k, by a Number of very noble Sentiments, which are &s;cattered through the Original in many Lines, neither har&s;h or unmu&s;ical; wherein there &s;eems to breath the true in&s;pir'd Spirit of Poetry; and fancy plays within her proper Sphere, under the Re&s;traint of a well temper'd critical Judgment; but much more by the &s;trong Contra&s;t of virtuous and vi|cious Characters, with which I found it adorn'd; which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful, laudable, and con&s;equently the funda|mental Part of the <HI>DRAMA.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
To reduce the Multiplicity of Characters, the Train of Incidents, to make the Parts of <HI>LIVIA,</HI> and <HI>AGRIP|PINA,</HI> &s;omewhat intere&s;ting, which in <HI>JOHNSON</HI> are very near de&s;picable; to &s;elect his Beauties, and by pro|per Means to bring about the Cata&s;trophe; &s;eem'd, at fir&s;t, an Enterprize as difficult, as toiling for Wealth in a Mine; and almo&s;t &s;tartled me from my De&s;ign; But however, as I had begun, I determined to pro|ceed; and of my Succe&s;s, the Peru&s;al of the Piece will make you a Judge.</P>
<P><HI>JOHNSON</HI>'s &s;trict Adherence to Hi&s;tory, in his two Plays of <HI>SEJANUS</HI> and <HI>Catiline,</HI> would have been highly commendable, had it not been manife&s;tly preju|dicial to him; &s;ince he has been &s;o &s;chola&s;tically nice, as &s;carcely to omit a &s;ingle Per&s;on or Incident, mention'd in the Lives of the&s;e <HI>great wicked</HI> Men; nay he has even tran&s;lated literally, in his <HI>SEJANUS,</HI> &s;everal Lines from <HI>CORNELIUS TACITUS:</HI> By this Means his Tragedies became rather dramatic Hi&s;tories, than Entertainments &s;uited to a modern Theatre. From this I have ventur'd to deviate; I have kept <HI>CAESAR</HI> at <HI>ROME,</HI> to pre&s;ide at the Conviction of <HI>SEJANUS;</HI> as I think it adds much Spirit, to the clo&s;ing the Ca|ta&s;trophe; I have drawn him of a Di&s;po&s;ition much milder than he was in Reality. The pious Re&s;olution of repealing the Oppre&s;&s;ions, and healing the con&s;titutional Wounds made by <HI>SEJANUS,</HI> which I have put into his Mouth, in the la&s;t Speech of the Play, I thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
to pre&s;erve <HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice;</HI> to which I think Hi&s;tory &s;hould give Way; for the real U&s;e of dramatic Performances is, to in&s;til Virtue, and rai&s;e an Ab|horrence of Vice. Example is a &s;trong Argument; nothing conduces &s;o much to our Reformation, as pu|ni&s;hing the Wicked and rewarding the Virtuous, 'tis then that the Moral is truly &s;trong, indeed the Guilt|le&s;s mu&s;t &s;ometimes fall, to heighten the Di&s;tre&s;s, and impre&s;s us with a ju&s;t Pity.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Liberties &s;hould to the Critics appear Er|rors, I hone&s;tly confe&s;s them Errors of my Judgment; and for my Confe&s;&s;ion expect to be mildly treated. By the Critics, I would be under&s;tood to mean only the judici|ous, not &s;uch teizing In&s;ects, &s;uch buzzing Drones of Society, as tho&s;e at pre&s;ent di&s;tingui&s;h'd by that Name.</P>
<Q><L>Who fret and &s;trut their Hour upon the Stage,</L>
<L>And then are heard no more.</L>

<Q><L>Each Wight who reads not, and but &s;cans and &s;pell,</L>
<L>Each Word-catcher that lives on Syllables.</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>From &s;uch I neither wi&s;h or expect Indulgence, let them be ridiculous at my Expence, if they plea&s;e; my Pity they may move, but not my Anger. From the Penetration of the Judicious, I &s;hall be glad to meet Correction, their Clemency I doubt not, for &s;till like the Brave, they chu&s;e rather to &s;pare than de&s;troy. My
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
a&s;&s;erting that I had a <HI>national Advantage in View,</HI> in this Subject may be thought chimerical, at fir&s;t, but when the following Ab&s;tract from Hi&s;tory, of the Life of <HI>SEJANUS,</HI> is con&s;idered, what I have advanced may perhaps be allowed.</P>
<P><HI>AELIUS SEJANUS</HI> the Son of <HI>SEIUS STRABO</HI> was born in <HI>TUSCANY.</HI> He &s;erved, when young, with &s;ome Reputation, under <HI>CAIUS CAESAR,</HI> Nephew to <HI>AUGUSTUS,</HI> and afterwards in the <HI>Praetorian Band</HI> under the Command of <HI>TIBERIUS;</HI> to the various Turns of who&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition by conforming, he gradually crept into his clo&s;e&s;t Secrets, and was the fir&s;t in his E&s;teem. When <HI>TIBERIUS</HI> mounted the Imperial Throne, he allowed this his favourite, &s;uch an Extent of Power, as rendered him the Terror of hone&s;t Men, and the Idol of Sycophants. The taking off <HI>GERMA|NICUS,</HI> Hu&s;band to the <HI>AGRIPPINA,</HI> who is intro|duced in this Play, and Nephew to the Emperor, a Prince remarkable for the greate&s;t Virtues, though the Odium of it was artfully flung on <HI>GNEIUS PISO, GERMANICUS</HI>'s Lieutenant, was generally and ju&s;tly attributed to him: This was his fir&s;t clo&s;e Attack upon the <HI>LIBERTY</HI> of <HI>ROME,</HI> and procured him the Hatred of the People. After this by the Means of <HI>LIVIA,</HI> Wife to <HI>DRUSUS, EUDEMUS</HI> her Phy&s;ician, and <HI>Lygdus</HI> an Eunuch, who was <HI>SEJANUS</HI>'s <HI>CATAMITE,</HI> he contrived and effected the Death of <HI>DRUSUS,</HI> Son to <HI>TIBERIUS,</HI> and Heir apparent to the Empire. The
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for his Hatred, was a Blow which <HI>DRUSUS</HI> one Day gave him; but his future Proceed|ings &s;hewed, Ambition, not Revenge, was the Motive which urg'd to the Deed; for he had determin'd to remove every Bar, which lay between him and the Throne. This was but a Prelude to his future Vil|lainies. <HI>AGRIPPINA,</HI> her Sons, and all who were Friends to the <HI>Family</HI> of the dead <HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> were next to be di&s;po&s;ed of. This was effected by re|pre&s;enting them to <HI>CAESAR,</HI> who was naturally of a <HI>jealous</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition, as a&s;piring and ambitious, and con&s;equently dangerous. <HI>CAIUS SILIUS</HI> was fir&s;t mark'd out for Sacrifice; who being, before the Se|nate, criminated by <HI>VARRO</HI> the Con&s;ul, and finding his Death had been premeditately re&s;olved on; by a voluntary Wound anticipated a public Execution.</P>
<P><HI>SABINUS,</HI> another Adherent to the Family of <HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> was next taken off, by the Means of <HI>LATIARIS,</HI> his Relation and profe&s;s'd Friend: who having often, with much &s;eeming Sincerity, rail'd at the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Tyranny of <HI>SEJANUS,</HI> and thus, by touching him,
<Q><L>Ev'n on the tend're&s;t Point, the Ma&s;ter String</L>
<L>Which <HI>made</HI> mo&s;t Harmony, or Di&s;cord in him.</L>
<BIBL>ROWE.</BIBL></Q>
Having wrought him up to join in his Invectives, He fix'd two <HI>Senators,</HI> who were <HI>Creatures</HI> to
<PB N="x" REF="9">
<HI>SEJANUS,</HI> in a &s;ecret Place, whence they might overhear the Di&s;cour&s;e between <HI>SABINUS</HI> and him; who, on his too freely cen&s;uring the Conduct of <HI>CAESAR,</HI> ru&s;h'd from their Ambu&s;h, accu&s;ed him of Trea&s;on, and after a formal Proce&s;s, he was, by Death, ea&s;ed of the Pains which he endured, for the Sufferings of his Country.</P>
<P><HI>SEJANUS</HI> next, with the Concurrence of <HI>TIBERIUS,</HI> removed <HI>AGRIPPINA</HI> and her <HI>Sons,</HI> &s;o that he had none now left to oppo&s;e his Intere&s;t with <HI>CAESAR,</HI> or De&s;igns upon the <HI>Throne.</HI> Her he had bani&s;h'd to <HI>PANDATERIA</HI> an <HI>I&s;land</HI> in the <HI>TYRRHENE</HI> Sea, <HI>NERO</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>PONTIA</HI> near <HI>NAPLES,</HI> and <HI>DRUSUS</HI> confined in the mo&s;t abject Part of the Palace.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;ucce&s;sful in all his Schemes, what he aimed at became more and more apparent. To faci|litate his De&s;igns on the <HI>EMPEROR,</HI> he endeavoured to demean him in the Opinion of the People, by ridi|culing his Defects and Imperfections on the <HI>public Theatre.</HI> This fir&s;t induced <HI>CAESAR</HI> to examine more nearly into his Conduct; and he &s;oon found it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his own Safety, to hurl this <HI>COLOSSUS</HI> of the <HI>ROMAN STATE,</HI> &s;uddenly down the Steep of Fate. To effect this appeared &s;carcely practicable, &s;ince he feared the Fall of this &s;tupendous Pile, would drag down with it contiguous Ruin, in which he him&s;elf might be involved. However he at
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
la&s;t compa&s;&s;ed this coveted end, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>MACRO,</HI> and a Shew of encrea&s;ing Friend&s;hip and Tru&s;t, which rendered <HI>SEJANUS</HI> &s;till more &s;ecure, when his Glory was on the Verge of expiring: He was, when even &s;uch an Attempt mu&s;t have &s;eem'd impo&s;|&s;ible, accu&s;ed by a Letter from <HI>TIBERIUS</HI> then in <HI>CAPREA,</HI> &s;upported by Proofs in full <HI>Senate,</HI> of the mo&s;t flagitious Crimes; condemned with Ignominy, and to the unexpected Joy and Surprize of every <HI>hone&s;t Roman,</HI> precipitated from the topmo&s;t Height of <HI>For|tune</HI> to the lowe&s;t Depth of <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> and a &s;hameful Death. It is generally and ju&s;tly remarked, that the <HI>Sun&s;hine</HI> of Pro&s;perity animates a Number of buzzing Flies, who di&s;appear with its <HI>Decline.</HI> The Truth of this Ob&s;ervation was never more apparent than in the Ca&s;e of <HI>SEJANUS,</HI> for not one of the Number of <HI>Syco|phants</HI> and <HI>Dependants,</HI> who had been the In&s;truments of his villanies, and who held large Fortunes and Titles from his Bounty, offered to defend him at his Fall, or even wore the Face of Concern; nay &s;o far from it, they were his mo&s;t &s;anguine Enemies, and hurried him onward to his Fate.</P>
<P><HI>SEJANUS</HI> &s;eemed to have been mark'd out by Pro|vidence as an Example to Futurity, of that Ju&s;tice which will at one Time or other overtake the <HI>Great bad Man</HI> who u&s;es his Power to oppre&s;s, or to curtail the <HI>Liberties</HI> of his <HI>Country.</HI> And were this his Hi&s;tory
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
to be performed either publicly or privately for <HI>mini|&s;terial Amu&s;ement,</HI> an excellent and per&s;ua&s;ive In|&s;truction mu&s;t en&s;ue from it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Soil which was ble&s;&s;ed with a <HI>BRUTUS,</HI> a <HI>CATO</HI> and a <HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> was cur&s;ed with a <HI>SE|JANUS: BRITAIN</HI> who feels her&s;elf happy in an <HI>ORRERY,</HI> a <HI>CHESTERFIELD,</HI> and had in the Per&s;on of her late generally and ju&s;tly lamented <HI>PRINCE</HI> of <HI>WALES,</HI> all that <HI>ROME</HI> boa&s;ted in her <HI>GERMANICUS,</HI> knows not what <HI>SEJANUS</HI> may ri&s;e in future Times to wound her Peace.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s detaining me in the Country, I reque&s;ted my Friend Mr. <HI>DERRICK</HI> to pre&s;ent this Play to Mr. <HI>GARRICK,</HI> which he accordingly did, and was pro|mi&s;ed by him an An&s;wer in four or five Days. Mr. <HI>DERRICK</HI> waited on him again about that Time, when with a <HI>Punctuality,</HI> which is not at all an&s;wer|able to the Character generally given of <HI>theatrical Managers,</HI> he returned the Piece with &s;ome Compli|ments as to its Merits, alledging, that it had too much Declamation in it, to &s;ucceed on the <HI>Stage;</HI> and I am induced to believe, that though this <HI>Play</HI> was not in|troduced to Mr. <HI>GARRICK</HI> under any <HI>particular pre|vailing Influence,</HI> he took the Trouble to peru&s;e it, and on that alone founded his An&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12">
However I &s;uppo&s;e you expect to find me &s;evere on the Manager, for pre&s;uming to repul&s;e my Offspring; but you are mi&s;taken; I am ever ready to <HI>receive,</HI> and thankful <HI>for</HI> In&s;truction.
