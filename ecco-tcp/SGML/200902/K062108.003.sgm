<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;till in this delightful &s;oli|tude; Mrs. Montague, on account of a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition of the governor, could make me but a &s;hort vi&s;it: but finding my health &s;o much mended &s;ince I have been here, &s;he very obligingly pre&s;&s;ed me to continue a week longer; and left me the key of a clo&s;et which contains her books, among which &s;he &s;aid I might po&s;&s;ibly find &s;ome that would plea&s;e me. They are indeed generally well cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">New York.</P>
<P>HERE I am, again, in the mid&s;t of balls, concerts, long dinners, late &s;up|pers, and a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;its. Mi&s;s Bellenden declares it is a charm|ing place: &s;he is univer&s;ally admired, but has not made one conque&s;t&mdash;a cir|cum&s;tance that often attends mere beauty.</P>
<P>IN three days, however, we are to &s;et out for Albany. Mi&s;s Bellenden hangs her fair head at this intelligence. That town is remarkable for nothing but the great trade it carries on with the In|dians. The inhabitants are chiefly Dutch, and keep up the cu&s;toms and manners of their ance&s;tors&mdash;the ancient &s;ettlers. The officers and their fami|lies mu&s;t furni&s;h all the gay &s;ociety &s;he is likely to find there. It is true, her pride will be &s;oothed. Her father is commandant there, and fir&s;t commi&s;|&s;ioner
<PB N="3" REF="5">
likewi&s;e in civil affairs. He will live in great &s;tate; but &s;he will not be happy. However the Colonel, at his lady's reque&s;t, has taken a hou&s;e in this city, which he propo&s;es to vi&s;it once a year; and Mi&s;s Bellenden is a little com|forted by this arrangement.</P>
<P>WE are to perform this long voyage, of a hundred and fifty miles, on Hud|&s;on's river, in one of tho&s;e little yachts, great numbers of which are continually &s;ailing between New-York and Albany with the Indian trade. We went on board one of them this morning, in or|der to examine the accommodations we are likely to meet with; for calms, or contrary winds, &s;ometimes lengthen this pa&s;&s;age to a week or ten days. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are made extremely con|venient for pa&s;&s;engers. &mdash;There are two cabins in each, de&s;tined for their u&s;e, one has &s;ix beds, three on each &s;ide; the &s;pace in the middle, contains a large table, chairs, and other conveniences;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the furniture of the beds, chairs, and windows is of delicate figured calico. Nothing can exceed the neatne&s;s which reigns in every part of the&s;e little ve&s;|&s;els; the boards, even on the deck, are as nice as tho&s;e of a lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the Colonel has &s;ent mo&s;t of his &s;ervants already to Albany, yet our company is &s;till large enough to re|quire three of the&s;e yachts to convey us. It is &s;ettled, that Mrs. Bellenden, the three young ladies, my&s;elf, and Mrs. Bellenden's woman, are to go in one &s;loop; Mrs. Ben&s;on, with Fanny and &s;ome female &s;ervants, will occupy the cabin in another; the Colonel, with Mr. Neville, and &s;ome officers from New-York, who, out of re&s;pect, attend him to Albany, will lead the van. To|morrow will be devoted to farewel vi|&s;its; and the next day we &s;hall em|bark.</P>

<P>NOT one line have I been able to write to my dear Maria for the&s;e ten days pa&s;t. Our voyage la&s;ted eight days, becau&s;e we would have it &s;o. &mdash; I will explain this circum&s;tance to you in due time. And now being tolera|bly well &s;ettled, and having full lei&s;ure for the &s;weete&s;t employment of my life, conver&s;ing (&s;o I will call it) with you &mdash;I will go on with my u&s;ual prolixity.</P>
<P>AFTER a tedious day &s;pent in the ceremonial of leave-taking, we retired early to re&s;t, hoping to go on board quietly in the morning, without any further parade; but in this we were mi&s;taken. &mdash;All the officers, and many of the principal gentlemen in the place, came to wait upon the Colonel, and at|tend him to the water &s;ide: &s;ome ladies al&s;o paid the &s;ame compliment to Mrs.
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Bellenden; in a word, we had a nume|rous train.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Wilmot brought my &s;weet Edmund to take leave of me again. I thought I &s;hould never get loo&s;e from his arms; he hung about me in tears, even &s;obbing with the violence of his emotions; the Captain, at la&s;t, forced him away.</P>
<P>THE cannon from the battery &s;aluted the Colonel's yacht as it pa&s;&s;ed; and the ladies of the fort family (for that is the phra&s;e here), did us the honour to come out, and waved their handker|chiefs to us. We had little wind, but that favourable; and we &s;ailed &s;lowly along upon the mo&s;t delightful river imaginable, the &s;hores on each &s;ide ex|hibiting a pro&s;pect, &s;ometimes all beau|tifully wild and romantic, &s;ometimes rich with flouri&s;hing plantations, and elegant man&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">WHEN dinner-time approached, the &s;kipper (for that is the title given to the Dutch commander of the&s;e little ve&s;&s;els) told us, that if we cho&s;e to dine on &s;hore, he would come to an anchor near any &s;pot we liked be&s;t; that the trees would afford us &s;hade, and the mo&s;&s;y banks a table and &s;eats. We all approved of this hint; Clara e&s;peci|ally, who is a little romantic.</P>
<P>WE pitched upon a very pa&s;toral &s;cene, and the boat carried us on &s;hore; we &s;ent it immediately to fetch Mrs. Ben&s;on; and &s;oon afterwards the Co|lonel, who from his yacht had ob|&s;erved what was doing, joined us with his company. We had a very elegant cold collation; for our good friends at New-York had, unknown to us, &s;ent a profu&s;ion of delicacies to increa&s;e our &s;tores.</P>
<P>WE did not part till the evening, when, a fre&s;h breeze &s;pringing up, we
<PB N="8" REF="10">
ha&s;tened on board our &s;eparate ve&s;&s;els, and made a great deal of way in the night; but in the morning we were again becalmed, and as we moved &s;lowly along the liquid plain, which was as &s;mooth as gla&s;s, we were at lei&s;ure to admire the magnificent &s;cene that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to our eyes. &mdash;The river here being very narrow, running be|tween a ridge of mountains on each &s;ide, who&s;e tops, covered with groves of lofty trees, &s;eemed to hide their heads in the clouds, while their &s;loping &s;ides were adorned with the mo&s;t beautiful ver|dure, and trees of many &s;pecies un|known to us. The awful gloom from the &s;urrounding &s;hades, the &s;olemn &s;till|ne&s;s, in&s;pired a &s;oft and plea&s;ing melan|choly, which we enjoyed in &s;ilence, be|ing, as the poet &s;ays, "rapt in pen&s;ive mu&s;ing"</P>
<P>MISS Bellenden, mean time, diverted her&s;elf with a&s;king our &s;kipper a thou|&s;and &s;illy que&s;tions; and he, in the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, informed her, that even among the&s;e wilds &s;ome inhabitants were to be found, who lived there &s;ecluded from all conver&s;e with their &s;pecies, except, &s;ometimes, a &s;trag|gling Indian or two would &s;tumble, by chance, upon their dwellings in the la|byrinth of the woods. They &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, he &s;aid, upon the milk of their cows, &s;ome game, when they were able to catch it, and the &s;pontaneous fruits of the earth.</P>
<P>OUR curio&s;ity was &s;trongly excited by this account; we were impatient to &s;ee the&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e manners, we &s;up|po&s;ed, mu&s;t be as &s;avage as their way of life.</P>
<P>THE &s;kipper attended us on &s;hore. &mdash; And Mrs. Bellenden, as lively and en|terpri&s;ing as the younge&s;t of us, walked the wild, fearle&s;s and untired; but no human creature could we &s;ee; and, after traver&s;ing many a rugged path, and
<PB N="10" REF="12">
climbing up many a &s;teep a&s;cent, we were upon the point of giving over our fruitle&s;s &s;earch, when we heard the tinkling of a bell; we followed the found, and pre&s;ently di&s;covered a cow, paceing &s;lowly along a winding path in the woods, which, we &s;uppo&s;ed, led to &s;ome habitation.</P>
<P>WE pur&s;ued her tract, and in a few moments came to a delightful &s;pot, en|tirely cleared of under-wood, &s;haded with trees of a mo&s;t beautiful foliage, with flowering &s;hrubs between, and a luxurious growth of honey&s;uckles twin|ing round their trunks. A &s;pring of the cleare&s;t water ran meandering among&s;t their roots, and meeting with a hol|low, which &s;eemed to have been a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, formed a ba&s;on that &s;up|plied the nece&s;&s;ities of the family.</P>
<P>AT a &s;mall di&s;tance &s;tood an oven built of clay; a large platter, formed of the &s;ame materials, hardened in the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;un, &s;tood upon the top, full of wild pigeons, of which, in this &s;ea&s;on of the year, it &s;eems there is great plenty; they had been baked in the oven, which was preparing a &s;econd di&s;h to furni&s;h out the repa&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of peaches, which grow wild in &s;uch plenty, that they feed their hogs with them all over this country.</P>
<P>WE now ventured to enter the cot|tage; the &s;ides of which were of clay, &s;upported on the out-&s;ide by thick branches of trees &s;trongly fa&s;tened to|gether, the roof thatched very firmly, and the chimney very well contrived, and formed of bricks, which &s;eemed to have been the work of the &s;ame archi|tect.</P>
<P>I TOOK notice, that the fire-place was of an enormous &s;ize; the &s;kipper &s;aid, not larger than was needful. The winters here are inten&s;ely cold, it &s;eems; and the inhabitants of this cottage can,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
with very little labour, &s;upply them&s;elves with plenty of fuel.</P>
<P>IN one corner was their bed, com|po&s;ed of dry leaves and bear &s;kins. On &s;ome rudely fa&s;hioned &s;helves, we &s;aw &s;everal large clay ve&s;&s;els full of milk, which had thrown up a very rich cream. We were very de&s;irous of taking &s;ome away with us for our tea, but was at a lo&s;s what to put it in. &mdash;Mi&s;s Clara, &s;earching about, found &s;ome cocoa-nut &s;hells, which had been &s;awed in two, and were ranged like tea-cups on a &s;helf; we filled one of the&s;e with cream, which we &s;kimmed with a wooden &s;poon we &s;aw there; and having depo&s;ited &s;ome half-crowns and &s;hillings, as payment for what we had taken, were preparing to depart, when the Dutchman, looking at us with a mixture of contempt and &s;ur|pri&s;e in his countenance, exclaimed&mdash; 'No, no, this mu&s;t not be' and was &s;weeping all the money, except one &s;hil|ling, into his hat, when Mrs. Bellen|den
<PB N="13" REF="15">
ob&s;erving what he was about, or|dered him, in a peremptory tone, to put it back; which he did, with a &s;or|rowful look, &s;hrugging up his &s;houl|ders, and &s;haking his head at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>WE now heard a coar&s;e voice, which, however, &s;eemed to be that of a woman, calling aloud; at which we were a little frightened; but the &s;kipper told us, it was the mi&s;tre&s;s of the cottage calling her cow by name; we went out to meet her; but the poor creature was in &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hment and terror at our ap|pearance, that &s;he &s;eemed ready to fall to the ground.</P>
<P>A CHILD about two years old, which &s;he held in her arms, &s;eeing us approach, almo&s;t &s;tunned us with its &s;creams; and even the cow, who, obedient to the call of its mi&s;tre&s;s, was ha&s;tening to her, no &s;ooner &s;aw us, than, as if &s;truck with a
<PB N="14" REF="16">
panic likewi&s;e, it turned about, and trotted back into the woods.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible to help laugh|ing at the general con&s;ternation our appearance had occa&s;ioned. We would fain have entered into &s;ome conver&s;ation with the good woman, but, be&s;ides that &s;he did not under&s;tand a word of Engli&s;h, and we could not talk Dutch, when we offered to go near her, &s;he would draw back a few paces in evident terror.</P>
<P>OUR conductor having &s;poke to her a few minutes in Dutch, &s;he &s;eemed better reconciled to us, and paid her re&s;pects often, in &s;omewhat between a bow and a curt&s;ey. We &s;hewed her the cream we had taken, and pointed to the money we had left in return for it; to which we added &s;omething more; and ob&s;erving that the poor woman was wretchedly clothed, and that the in|fant
<PB N="15" REF="17">
was more than half naked, we col|lected our cambrick pocket-handker|chiefs together, and even added our aprons, and gave her.</P>
<P>SHE received our gifts with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, and accom|panied us part of our way to the boat, often calling on her hu&s;band, who, how|ever, did not appear, and who was pro|bably not within hearing.</P>
<P>THE condition of the&s;e poor people &s;eems to be bad; and I do not find that they receive much relief from the wealthy owners of the rich plantati|ons, which are in the neighbourhood of the&s;e high lands. The many that need, and the many that deny pity, make up the bulk of mankind.</P>

<P>OUR navigation down this delightful river la&s;ted eight days; it is true, we
<PB N="16" REF="18">
protracted it to this time, by the fre|quent excur&s;ions we made on &s;hore. &mdash; Some of the&s;e I have given you an ac|count of, which, I am afraid, will ap|pear rather tedious; for it is no ea&s;y matter to entertain eyes that are not accu&s;tomed to fix upon vulgar objects, and to admini&s;ter plea&s;ure to a mind that is actuated only by lawful pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE Colonel was received here with much ceremony: the cannon from the fort was fired; the &s;oldiers, headed by their officers, were drawn up on the beach; the mayor, with the principal citizens, attended his landing, and con|ducted him to the fort, where the com|manding officer always re&s;ides.</P>
<P>THIS is a regular fortification, &s;ituated upon a &s;teep hill, which, overlooks the town, and has within it a large and ele|gant hou&s;e for the commander, and convenient barracks for the &s;oldiers, with a guard-room, and a hand&s;ome
<PB N="17" REF="19">
apartment for the lieutenant upon duty.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden had rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the care and diligence of her &s;ervants; who had been &s;ent &s;ome weeks before with the baggage. &mdash;She found her apartments in very good or|der; and I left her and the young ladies in high &s;pirits, delighted with the new and &s;trange objects around them, and retired to a ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e in the town, which Mr. Neville had taken care to have provided for me.</P>
<P>THIS town is wor&s;e built than New-York; few of the hou&s;es have an elegant appearance on the out-&s;ide, but an ex|ce&s;&s;ive neatne&s;s reigns within. The language, the manners, the dre&s;s, all Dutch.</P>
<P>DURING the whole time of my re&s;i|dence in New-York, I had never &s;een any of the &s;avages; but they are often to
<PB N="18" REF="20">
be met with here. The Indian trade is very con&s;iderable, and has enriched many of the inhabitants of Albany; who at pre&s;ent, however, do not make the enormous profits they did formerly. The indians, under &s;uch excellent ma&s;|ters of traffic as the Dutch, have ac|quired a knowledge of the &s;ucce&s;sful artifices of trade, and are &s;ometimes a match even for them in knavery.</P>
<P>THEY take great liberties with the town's people, entering their hou&s;es freely, if they find the doors open, and &s;eating them&s;elves wherever they like be&s;t, remain &s;everal hours together without being di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>I HAD as yet &s;een an Indian only from my window. When going one day into my kitchen, to give &s;ome orders to my cook, I was extremely alarmed to &s;ee one of the&s;e &s;avages &s;eated by the fire, &s;moking his pipe very compo&s;edly. His appearance had driven away all my &s;er|vants,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
but a black woman, employed in the drudgery of the kitchen; and, in|deed, that appearance was &s;hocking enough to ju&s;tify their fears.</P>
<P>HE had a fierce and menacing look; his copper-coloured face was painted in round &s;pots of red, yellow, and black; his hair &s;trewed with &s;ome kind of powder of a deep red, which looked like blood &s;treaming from different wounds in his head; his ears were &s;tretched to an enormous length by the weight of the &s;trange ornaments he wore in them, pieces of tin, gla&s;s, &s;trings of &s;hells, bra&s;s rings, and even &s;lips of woollen cloth of &s;everal colours, which hung down to his &s;houlders.</P>
<P>HIS dre&s;s was a &s;hirt made of O&s;na|burgh linen, a &s;hort petticoat of the &s;ame, which reached to his knees, in the manner of the Scotch highlanders, and, over all, a mantle of coar&s;e flannel, which, being a beau, was adorned with
<PB N="20" REF="22">
&s;everal narrow borders of &s;carlet li&s;t&mdash; He had a large knife hanging at a kind of girdle, un&s;heathed, ready for mi&s;|chief, as I thought.</P>
<P>THIS tremenduous object continued to &s;moke his pipe, without taking any notice of me, while I &s;tood motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e and fear. When the black girl came up clo&s;e to me, whi&s;pering, in her gibberi&s;h, <Q>You mu&s;t be no fraid of Indian, my lady,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>if Indian &s;ee you fraid of him, he be quite mad.</Q></P>
<P>THIS hint made me endeavour to recollect my&s;elf; and, all trembling as I was, I ventured to approach him, and very humbly dropt him a curt&s;ey, which he returned with a nod, crying, <Q>Hoh, hoh!</Q> in a voice, however, le&s;s terrible than his looks.</P>
<P>I THEN ordered &s;ome cold meat and bread to be &s;et before him, at which he
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed; and making him another curt&s;ey, with trembling knees, for I was &s;till dreadfully fright|ened, I went to find Mrs. Ben&s;on, and related my adventure; &s;he, not at all di&s;mayed, was eager to take a view of my &s;avage gue&s;t; her courage embold|ened Fanny and the cook. The Indian, without minding them, eat like a wolf, and when he was &s;atisfied, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>WE knew not how to get him away; when, fortunately, Mr. Neville came in. We told him in what perplexity we were; and he immediately marched into the kitchen, making, on purpo&s;e, a great noi&s;e on his entrance, which rou&s;ed the Indian, who, &s;eeing him dre&s;&s;ed in regimentals, for he was ju&s;t come off guard, &s;tarted up, &s;hook hands with him very cordially, and went away.</P>
<P>THEY pay great re&s;pect to the mili|tary, and never pre&s;ume to come unin|vited
<PB N="22" REF="24">
into their hou&s;es; a circum&s;tance I was extremely glad to hear; for &s;uch intru&s;ion, if frequent, would have made me very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>THIS city, as I have already ob&s;erved, carries on a great trade wirh the Indians, who barter furrs for blankets, O&s;naburgh &s;hirts, guns, hatchets, knives, kettles, powder and &s;hot, and many other arti|cles. Here the treaties, and other tran&s;actions, between us and the Iro|quois Indians are negociated. And every third year, the governor of New|York comes here to meet them, and re|new the alliance.</P>
<P>THIS nation, or rather combination of five nations, united by an ancient and inviolable league among them&s;elves, are the olde&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;teady, and mo&s;t effectual ally we have found among the Indians. By their unanimity, firmne&s;s, military &s;kill, and policy, they have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to be the mo&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="25">
formidable power in all America. They have reduced a great number of other nations under their dominion; and a territory twice as large as the kingdom of France.</P>
<P>THE five nations of the Iroquois compo&s;e the mo&s;t celebrated common|wealth of Indians in America.</P>
<P>THE nations of America are at a great di&s;tance from each other, with a va&s;t de&s;ert frontier, and hid in the bo&s;om of hideous, and almo&s;t boundle&s;s fore&s;ts. The Mohawks, a tribe of the Iroquois, who dwell neare&s;t our &s;ettlements, are converted to chri&s;tianity, and con&s;e|quently, in &s;ome degree, civilized. The government pays a clergyman, who officiates in their chapel, which was built for them by Queen Anne, who likewi&s;e pre&s;ented them with a fine &s;et of alter|plate, and other decorations for it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">There is a fort here, called by the name of a former governor, in which there is a &s;mall garri&s;on, commanded by a lieutenant, who may be relieved every year; but the pre&s;ent officer, Mr. Butler, either becau&s;e he is fond of command, or the emoluments ari&s;ing from it, pe|titioned to be continued in it, and has actually lived there ten years. The In|dians love him, and have pre&s;ented him with lands to a con&s;iderable value. &mdash; They have been equally generous to their &s;piritual pa&s;tor, who is likewi&s;e a great favorite with them.</P>
<P>IT is the&s;e Mohawks who come among&s;t us &s;o frequently at Albany. Though converts to our faith, they pre|&s;erve mo&s;t of their ancient cu&s;toms. &mdash; Religion &s;eems to have but little in|fluence upon their conduct and manners. Their virtues are their own; their vices often copied from their enlightened allies.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">THE Indians are tall, their limbs &s;trait and well proportioned, their bodies are &s;trong, but of a &s;pecies of &s;trength, it is &s;aid, rather fitted for much hard|&s;hip, than to continue long at any &s;er|vile work, by which they are quickly con&s;umed. Their heads are flattened by art, their features are regular, but their countenance fierce; they have long black lank hair, no beards, their &s;kins a reddi&s;h brown, a colour admired among them, and improved by the con&s;tant u&s;e of bear's-grea&s;e and paint.</P>
<P>THE whole fa&s;hion of their lives is of a piece, hardy, poor, and &s;qualid; and their education, from their infancy, is &s;olely directed to fit their bodies for this mode of life, and to form their minds to a capacity of enduring and in|flicting the greate&s;t evils.</P>
<P>THEIR only occupations are war and hunting; agriculture is left to the wo|men;

for merchandize they have the greate&s;t contempt. When their hunt|ing &s;ea&s;on is pa&s;t, the fatigues of which they &s;uffer with much patience, and in which they exert great ingenuity, they pa&s;s the re&s;t of their time in an entire indolence&mdash;&s;leep half the day in their huts, and ob&s;erve no bounds in eating. Drinking they were not addicted to, having no &s;pirituous liquors among them; but &s;ince they have acquired this ta&s;te, it has given a &s;pur to their indu&s;|try, and enjoyment to their repo&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS is the principal end of all their treaties with us; and from this they &s;uf|fer inexpre&s;&s;ible calamities; for having once begun to drink, they ob&s;erve no mea&s;ure, but continue a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of drunkenne&s;s as long as the means of procuring liquor la&s;ts. &mdash;Even the Mo|hawk chri&s;tians are guilty of this exce&s;s; and, when intoxicated, are capable of committing the greate&s;t cruelties.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">THEY are grave even to &s;adne&s;s in their deportment, upon any &s;erious oc|ca&s;ion; ob&s;ervant of tho&s;e in company, and re&s;pectful to the old.

They expre&s;s great con|tempt for the vivacity of the Europeans, who interrupt each other, and fre|quently &s;peak all together. The tone of their voice is &s;oft and agreeable; that of the women, I am told, is won|derfully &s;weet and harmonious.</P>
<P>ALL I have told you of the Indians, and much more that I have yet to tell you, you mu&s;t not imagine is the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervations, for which I have had but few opportunities yet; but the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;ome conver&s;ations with a very &s;en&s;ible man, whom Mr. Neville met with at the Colonel's, and intro|duced to my acquaintance. He came
<PB N="28" REF="30">
to America merely to gratify a curio&s;ity, which has carried him over half the world, I believe, and is but lately re|turned from O&s;wego, a factory on the lake Ontario, which is at a great di&s;|tance from hence. We have a fort there, by which mo&s;t of the Indians pa&s;s in their way to Montreal.</P>
<P>IN this wild region, inhabited only by &s;avages, did Mr. Eu&s;ton pa&s;s a whole year. The officer who commanded the detachment &s;ent thither to relieve the &s;mall garri&s;on being his friend, he ac|companied him in his tedious march; and came back with him when he al&s;o was relieved in his turn.</P>
<P>IT &s;eemed to me &s;urpri&s;ing that a man, formed by nature, and enabled by fortune, to enjoy all the elegances of life, could voluntary wa&s;te &s;o great a part of his time among a race of beings, in appearance &s;o truly wretched. He &s;miled at the compa&s;&s;ion, mixed with
<PB N="29" REF="31">
horror, which I te&s;tified for their condition; and combated my notions in a manner &s;o new and amu&s;ing, that I cannot forbear giving you a &s;pecimen of &s;ome of his arguments, which, he told me, were all drawn from the cele|brated Abb&eacute; Reynal. <Q>It is in the nature of man, &s;ays that &s;en&s;ible and elegant writer,</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q>that we mu&s;t look for his means of happine&s;s. What does he want to be as happy as he can be? &mdash;pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and if he thinks of futurity&mdash;the hopes, and certainty of enjoying that ble&s;&s;ing. The &s;avage who has not been driven into, nor confined within the frigid zones by civilized &s;ocieties, is not in want of this fir&s;t of nece&s;&s;aries; if he lays in no &s;tores, it is becau&s;e the earth and the &s;eas are re&s;ervoirs, always open to &s;upply his wants&mdash;fi&s;h and game are to be had all the year, and will &s;upply the want of fertility in the dead &s;ea&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"><Q>THE &s;avage indeed, &s;ays the ele|gant writer who&s;e words I quote, has no hou&s;e well &s;ecured from the acce&s;s of external air, or commodious fire|places; but his furrs an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of the roof, the garment, and the &s;tove. He works but for his own occa&s;ions; &s;leeps when he is weary, and is a &s;tranger to watchings and re&s;tle&s;s nights. War is a matter of choice to him; danger, like labour, is a con|dition of his nature, not a profe&s;&s;ion annexed to his birth&mdash;a national duty, not a dome&s;tic &s;ervitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE &s;avage is &s;erious, but not me|lancholy; his countenance &s;eldom bears the impre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;orders, that leave &s;uch &s;hocking and fatal traits on ours. He cannot &s;eel the want of what he does not de|&s;ire; nor can he de&s;ire what he is ignorant of. Mo&s;t of the convenlences of life are remedies for evils he does
<PB N="31" REF="33">
not feel. He &s;eldom experiences any of that wearine&s;s that ari&s;es from un&s;a|tisfied de&s;ires; or that emptine&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, that is the offspring of prejudice and vanity. In a word, the &s;avage is &s;ubject to none but na|tural evils.</Q></P>
<P>My philo&s;opher, ob&s;erving I li&s;tened to him with plea&s;ure, went on with his quotations. <Q>What greater happine&s;s than this, &s;ays the Abb&eacute;, does the civil|ized man enjoy? His food is more whole&s;ome and delicate than that of the &s;avage; he has &s;ofter clothes, and a habitation better &s;ecured again&s;t the inclemencies of the weather. But &s;hould he live under a government, where ty|ranny mu&s;t be endured under the name of authority&mdash;to what outrages is not the civilized man expo&s;ed! If he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any property, he knows not how far he may call it his own; when he mu&s;t, divide the produce between the courtier, who may attack
<PB N="32" REF="34">
his e&s;tate; the lawyer, who mu&s;t be paid for teaching him how to pre&s;erve it; the &s;oldier, who may lay it wa&s;te; and the collector, who comes to levy unlimited taxes.</Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, this picture, though a little overcharged, is not ill drawn. Mr. Neville li&s;tens with great plea&s;ure to this gentleman's account of the cu&s;toms and manners of the American nations. He is &s;o fond of change of &s;cene, and of varying his modes of life, that I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find him envying Mr. Butler's &s;ituation, and &s;oliciting to have his turn in that command, in order to enjoy the new and untried plea&s;ures of an abode on the lake Ontario.</P>
<P>THE ladies of the fort have had full employment, for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t, in receiving the vi&s;its of all the Dutch families who have preten&s;ions to the honour of being received there. Their
<PB N="33" REF="35">
manners, their dre&s;s, their conver&s;ation, are &s;o &s;trange, &s;o uncouth, &s;o rudely fa|miliar, that I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the di&s;gu&s;t they create. Mrs. Bellenden, who is perfectly well bred, and who ranks politene&s;s, I believe, among&s;t the cardinal virtues, conceals, with the ut|mo&s;t caution, her di&s;like of the&s;e &s;trange vi&s;itants; and the le&s;s they &s;eem intitled to her delicate attentions, &s;he is the more a&s;&s;iduous in practi&s;ing them, as if &s;he hoped to civilize them by example. &mdash;Meantime they &s;tare, and are con|founded when &s;he addre&s;&s;es them, and either do not an&s;wer at all, or in a man|ner &s;o rude and &s;trange, that &s;he blu&s;hes, is confu&s;ed, and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>MISS Bellenden &s;eldom &s;peaks, but her looks expre&s;s a contempt of her company, which her mother often checks by a &s;ignificant glance. As for Clara, &s;he continues to be extremely bu&s;y with her knotting, apparently to prevent the ludicrous ideas, that are ex|cited
<PB N="34" REF="36">
in her mind, from appearing in her countenance; but the archne&s;s of her &s;tolen glances do not e&s;cape the notice of her mamma, who &s;eems ex|tremely apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t the young ladies &s;hould fail in any article of polite|ne&s;s to her unpoli&s;hed gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on under&s;tands the Dutch language &s;ufficiently to enable her to keep up a little conver&s;ation with the&s;e ladies, which is a great relief to Mrs. Bellenden, and equal plea&s;ure to them; who, although they can all &s;peak Engli&s;h, yet are very &s;hy in conver&s;ing in that language, &s;o that they di&s;cour&s;ed chiefly with each other.</P>
<P>My rank not giving me the privilege of being as &s;low in returning their vi&s;its as Mrs. Bellenden, Mrs. Ben&s;on and I have already paid our re&s;pects to &s;everal of the chief families here. We were entertained in a very ho&s;pitable manner, which, it &s;eems, is the cu&s;tom of the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
place; for immediately after the tea equipage was removed, a large table was brought out, and covered with a dama&s;k table cloth, exqui&s;itely white and fine; upon this table were placed &s;everal &s;orts of cakes, and tea-bread, with pats of the mo&s;t delicate butter, plates of hung-beef and ham, &s;haved ex|tremely fine, wet and dry &s;weetmeats, every kind of fruit in &s;ea&s;on, pi&s;tacchio and other nuts, all ready cracked with an in&s;trument for that purpo&s;e; the liquors were cyder, mead, and Madeira wine. &mdash; All the&s;e things were &s;erved in the fine&s;t china and gla&s;s; and if we did not eat heartily, it was not for want of example, for our good ho&s;ts &s;hewed as keen an appetite for this, their third meal &s;ince the morning, as if they had not till then broke their fa&s;t.</P>
<P>OUR thin European regale of a di&s;h of tea, and a &s;lice of cake, mu&s;t have appeared very par&s;imonious to per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to &s;uch plentiful afternoon
<PB N="36" REF="38">
collations; and I re&s;olved, when I was vi&s;ited next by my new friends, I would endeavour to treat them in their own way. But Mrs. Bellenden was to|tally again&s;t complying with this cu&s;tom; not from an over-attention to oeconomy, for &s;he is ho&s;pitable in the highe&s;t de|gree, but becau&s;e it &s;eemed a great of|fence to delicacy, and again&s;t every rule of decorum, to turn a vi&s;it into a coar&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial meal.</P>
<P>THIS lady is indeed not only ho&s;pita|ble, but has a ta&s;te for expence, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, defeats the purpo&s;e for which the Colonel, her hu&s;band, left his native country, at an age &s;omewhat advanced, to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in America, that he might &s;ave fortunes for his children.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tingui&s;hed rank the Colonel holds in this province, obliges him to ob&s;erve certain forms, which indeed in|clude a con&s;iderable expence, but which
<PB N="37" REF="39">
is made much more con&s;iderable by the high notions Mrs. Bellenden entertains of what his &s;tation requires of him. On all public days, it is u&s;ual for the mayor, the aldermen, and the principal inha|bitants of the city, to appear at the fort in their be&s;t dre&s;s to compliment the commandant; on the&s;e occa&s;ions, not only cake and wine are, by Mrs. Bellenden's orders, handed about in great plenty, but there is always a ball at night, and an elegant &s;upper for a &s;elect party. Be&s;ides this, her table is open to all &s;trangers of any fa&s;hion, who vi&s;it Albany; and there is now a greater, re&s;ort than ever, drawn by the beauty of the young ladies, and the ho&s;|pitable and elegant manners of the com|mandant and his lady.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly of &s;uch &s;trangers that the a&s;&s;embly, Mrs. Bellenden holds every fortnight, is compo&s;ed; for ex|cept the officers and their wives, and two or three of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed per|&s;ons
<PB N="38" REF="40">
&s;ons in the place, none of the inhabit|ants are either qualified, or indeed de&s;irous, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the&s;e entertain|ments.</P>
<P>THE Colonel, always keeping his laudable purpo&s;e in view, would wil|lingly draw his expences within a nar|rower circle, that is, &s;uch as he thinks merely o&s;tentatious; but whatever his rank really requires, he willingly a&s;&s;ents to; and to the calls of genero&s;ity and benevolence he attends with unre&s;|trained liberality.</P>
<P>ONE in&s;tance I mu&s;t give you, my dear Maria, of this worthy man's hu|manity and greatne&s;s of &s;oul.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival here, his fir&s;t lieutenant, who held the command during his ab&s;ence, pre&s;ented him a li&s;t of men in his own company, who being, on account of their age and in|firmities, judged wholly unfit for the
<PB N="39" REF="41">
ea&s;ie&s;t duty, were ordered home to be re|ceived into Chel&s;ea ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>THE Colonel, hearing that &s;ome of the&s;e &s;oldiers were near an hundred years of age, de&s;ired to &s;ee them particularly; accordingly they were all pre&s;ented to him in the great hall, where the ladies of the fort, my&s;elf, and &s;ome other com|pany, were a&s;&s;embled to view them.</P>
<P>OF this venerable group, the younge&s;t was eighty-two years old; &s;everal were an hundred, and one was an hundred and ten. Here was a &s;trong proof of the goodne&s;s of the climate; and it is &s;aid, and experience has proved it true, that the Europeans who come hither young generally live to a very great age.</P>
<P>THESE old men looked &s;urpri&s;ingly healthy; but they &s;eemed di&s;contented, and even &s;ad. The Colonel, after con|ver&s;ing with each of them a few mo|ments, at length ob&s;erved the melan|choly
<PB N="40" REF="42">
air of their countenances, and a&s;ked them the cau&s;e. &mdash;One of the olde&s;t then came forward, and making a low reverence,</P>
<P>'SIR,' &s;aid he, <Q>my companions and I are in great trouble, and if your Honour will be plea&s;ed to li&s;ten to our grievances, we &s;hall be bound to pray for your Honour.</Q></P>
<P>'LISTEN to your grievances!' inter|rupted the Colonel, with an affectionate tone, <Q>Aye, my good friends, and re|dre&s;s them too, if in my power.</Q></P>
<P>'OH, SIR,' replied the old man, <Q>we have all heard, before you came, that you are a noble gentleman. &mdash;God ble&s;s you for your kind &s;peech. This, plea&s;e your Honour, is our very hard ca&s;e&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>I AND my companions here, Sir, were young fellows when we left Old England; and yet we have &s;een &s;ome
<PB N="41" REF="43">
&s;arvice too&mdash;and we have been upon hard &s;arvice in our time here too, and fought wich French and Indians, and &s;pilt our blood for Old England and this here America, which is all one as our native land to us now. We married wives here, and have children and grand-children, and great-grand|children; and all we love is here, and we are u&s;ed to the climate; &s;o that it is a great hard&s;hip to be &s;ent to die from our friends.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SOME years ago, plea&s;e your Honour, &s;eventeen of our comrades were &s;ent over, very old men they were, and eleven of them died on board the &s;hip, and never &s;et foot on land; and the other &s;ix did not live many weeks after they came on &s;hore. And it is likely it will be the &s;ame with us, for we are very old; and if we &s;hould be &s;trong enough to bear the voyage, and the change of climate, we &s;hall break our hearts at leaving our children and friends.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44">THE poor old &s;oldier ended his &s;im|ple and affecting oration with another low reverence, and retired backward to his rank. We could perceive a tear or two drop on his &s;ilver beard. His com|panions di&s;covered great emotion all the time he was &s;peaking; and they all waited the Colonel's an&s;wer with ap|parent anxiety.</P>
<P>THE Colonel, approaching them with an air of ineffable &s;weetne&s;e and bene|volence, bid them not be unea&s;iy; he would con&s;ider their ca&s;e, and they &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>THEY were beginning to expre&s;s their joy and gratitude, in prai&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings on their commander, when the lieute|nant I mentioned before, who&s;e name is Blood, a name well &s;uited to his nature I believe, went ha&s;tily up to the Colo|nel; the old men, ob&s;erving this mo|tion, became &s;ilent on a &s;udden, and
<PB N="43" REF="45">
beheld him with looks, in which fear and aver&s;ion were &s;trongly marked.</P>
<P>'SIR,' &s;aid Mr. Blood to the Colonel, <Q>permit me the liberty of repre&s;enting to you the con&s;equence of the&s;e men's petition. &mdash;They have been on the &s;u|perannuated li&s;t for &s;everal months, ex|cu&s;ed from duty, and are con&s;igned to Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital. Their names are &s;truck out of the mu&s;ter-roll, and their places &s;upplied by &s;ix effective men who have been enli&s;ted in their &s;tead, &s;o that your company is com|plete; and if the&s;e men are not &s;ent to England, their pay mu&s;t, for the future, come out of your own pocket.</Q></P>
<P>THE Colonel with a &s;mile, not wholly free from contempt, made no reply, but turned from him; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the anxious veterans&mdash;</P>
<P>'MY friends,' &s;aid he, <Q>this matter depends wholly upon me I find; there|'fore
<PB N="44" REF="46">
I am not willing to leave you a moment in &s;u&s;pence. None of you &s;hall be &s;ent to England; you &s;hall &s;tay here among your friends, and end your days in ea&s;e and quiet. Your pay &s;hall run on as u&s;ual; and now you may withdraw, and drink the King's health.</Q> Saying this, he or|dered a &s;ervant to conduct them to the butler's pantry, and directed that they &s;hould have a plentiful repa&s;t, and a proper quantity of liquor.</P>
<P>THE gratitude of the&s;e old men was now too great for words; but their em|phatic &s;ilence, accompanied with tears, and eyes and hands li&s;ted up to Heaven in mental prayer for their benefactor, af|fected us all extremely. Every eye was fixed on the Colonel, with an expre&s;&s;ion of admiration and delight; every tongue congratulated him upon the heart|felt &s;atisfaction he had, by this noble act, both given and received. But Mr. Blood, &s;ullenly &s;ilent, &s;cowled &s;corn
<PB N="45" REF="47">
and anger from his black-beetle brows, and bowing more carele&s;sly than became him, withdrew.</P>
<P>MR. Neville tells me, this officer is univer&s;ally hated by the &s;oldiers, for his pride, rapaciou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;everity. He has lived here many years, and being the olde&s;t lieutenant in the &s;ervice, when the commandant dies the command of the garri&s;on, and all the forces here, de|volves upon him, till another is ap|pointed by the King, and arrives here.</P>
<P>HE has had the good luck to &s;urvive four of his commanders, and, during each interval of another appointment, has enjoyed all the power and emolu|ments of their po&s;t. Hence he &s;eems to claim a pre&s;criptive right to po&s;&s;e&s;s this dignity, and has been heard to boa&s;t, that Colonel Bellenden, who does not &s;eem built for duration, he &s;ays, will not long keep him out of it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">HEAVEN grant he may be mi&s;taken! What a pity that the life of a man, who is an honour to human nature, &s;hould be &s;hort. Yet &s;urely, he who may compute his exi&s;tence, not by the num|ber of his years, but his good actions, may be truly &s;aid to live long; for good actions are the &s;eeds of immorta|lity.</P>
<P>I AM tran&s;ported with joy, my dear Maria! I have a letter from you this moment; it was brought in the Colo|nel's packet. Oh! how generous, how kind, to be thus diligent in writing to me. I have locked my&s;elf up, and am vi&s;ible to no eye, that I may enjoy un|interrupted the dear luxury of conver|&s;ing with you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. MISS HARLEY TO MRS. NEVILLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EUPHEMIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now five months &s;ince you left England: time has not le&s;&s;ened my regrets for our &s;eparation, nor weaken|ed the ardor of my unavailing wi&s;hes for the ble&s;&s;ing of your &s;ociety. I re|member all the arguments your good &s;en&s;e employed to comfort me; I ap|prove them all, but I can apply none of them yet. My uncle rallies, reproaches, and even threatens me for the ob&s;tinacy of my grief for your lo&s;s. He tells me it will have a dangerous effect upon Mr. Harley, who has rea|&s;on
<PB N="48" REF="50">
to be jealous of a friend&s;hip that leaves him but the &s;econd place in my affection. But, without &s;ettling the ar|ticle of precedence in this ca&s;e, I referred him to what Mr. Harley &s;aid a few days after your departure, as it was repeated to me by Mr. Greville.</P>
<P><Q>MISS Harley's &s;en&s;ibility on this oc|ca&s;ion,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is the foundation of all my hopes. From a heart &s;o capable of a &s;incere attachment, the man who is &s;o happy as to be her choice, may expect all the refinements of a delicate pa&s;&s;ion, with all the perma|nence of a generous friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>THIS young man has, by his amiable qualities, &s;o endeared him&s;elf to my uncle, that he is unea&s;y when he is ab|&s;ent, even for a day; but to the claims of a mother, neither his gratitude nor his love can render him in the &s;malle&s;t degree inattentive. Sir John has obli|ged him to fix his re&s;idence at the Hall;
<PB N="49" REF="51">
but he never fails to vi&s;it Mrs. Harley three or four times a week, and often &s;tays a night at her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE been twice to wait on her, and was received with a profu&s;ion of kindne&s;s. She affected to call me daughter, and the young ladies care&s;&s;ed me like a &s;i&s;ter. With their care&s;&s;es indeed I was much plea&s;ed, and re|turned them very affectionately; but, whether I was prejudiced again&s;t Mrs. Harley's &s;incerity by the ac|count I had received of the early part of her conduct, or that the profe&s;&s;ions &s;he made me wanted that ingenuous and cordial air which carries them directly to the heart, I received them with fewer marks of gratitude than were due to them, if &s;incere; but I made up in re&s;pect what I wanted in tenderne&s;s, and my acknowledgments, &s;uch as they were, pa&s;&s;ed current with a heart which &s;eemed too little intere&s;ted in them to take the trouble of di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween appearances and reality.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">This lady, my dear Euphemia, has been very beautiful; the has one of tho&s;e mi&s;chief-making faces which have produced much di&s;order in the world, and which, but too often, make an effectual apology for the faults of the head and heart. I took notice that &s;he blu&s;hed when I delivered her a compli|ment from my uncle, which at that time I thought I could ea&s;ily account for, but which I have &s;ince better un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>WHEN we returned from this vi&s;it, Sir John was very particular in his en|quiries concerning the brothers and &s;i&s;ters of Mrs. Harley; but in what re|garded Mr. Harley he appeared ex|tremely cold and indifferent. She &s;oon after, at my de&s;ire, received an invitation to &s;pend &s;ome days at the Hall with her young family.</P>
<P>MR. Harley &s;et out in my uncle's coach to conduct her, and Mr. Gre|ville
<PB N="51" REF="53">
drove me in the phaeton as far as &mdash; to meet them. During our ride, he-was very urgent with me to give him my opinion of Mrs. Harley&punc; but in this ca&s;e I kept within a re|&s;erve, which I thought due to the cha|racter in which I was &s;hortly to regard this lady.</P>
<P>'COME, come,' &s;aid he, <Q>I know you have too much &s;incerity to deceive the world, and too much under&s;tand|ing to be deceived your&s;elf. You will never be a favourite with your mother|in-law that is to be&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible to be virtuous with the approbation of tho&s;e who are not &s;o them&s;elves; but you may be very ea&s;y with her, pro|vided you can be contented with ap|pearances.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All commerce with the world in general,</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q>is merely amu&s;e|ment, and tends to make one believe that people only meet together to im|po&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="54">
upon each other: the rea&s;onable &s;ew are friends, and &s;ee each other as they are; the re&s;t are only ac|quaintances, and make up one great ma&s;querade.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville having gone thus far, which was plainly with an intention to put me upon my guard again&s;t tho&s;e natural impul&s;es of affection and confi|dence, which young and innocent minds are apt too freely to indulge towards per&s;ons with whom they are newly connected, and which, when not re|turned with equal &s;incerity, produce di&s;content, complaints, and &s;ometimes indecent quarrels and reproaches; chang|ed the di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ubjects more agree|able, till the coach, with our expected gue&s;ts, appeared in view.</P>
<P>MR. Harley, who rode on hor&s;eback, no &s;ooner perceived the phaeton, than he galloped up to us with a &s;peed and impetuo&s;ity, which made Mr, Greville
<PB N="53" REF="55">
look at me, and &s;mile. The carriages met, and &s;topped: after a few compli|ments had pa&s;&s;ed, I de&s;ired Mrs. Har|ley to permit me to accompany her in the coach the re&s;t of the way. She ap|peared to take this as I wi&s;hed, an in|&s;tance of re&s;pect; for which Mr. Harley, in gratitude, I &s;uppo&s;e, thought fit to ki&s;s my hand with a mo&s;t lover-like ardour, as he helped me into the coach.</P>
<P>THE children were rejoiced to &s;ee me; and Mrs. Harley &s;aid a great many obliging things, and was in high &s;pirits. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at her deportment; the occa&s;ion indeed &s;eemed to call for for|titude, which &s;he doubtle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an uncommon degree. She was &s;oon to &s;ee a man whom &s;he had deceived, in|jured, and for&s;aken, yet to who&s;e gene|ro&s;ity &s;he mu&s;t owe her future &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her children. The&s;e circum&s;tances did not appear to excite any unea&s;y reflexions,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
or produce the lea&s;t perplexity in her behaviour.</P>
<P>I WATCHED her looks when the coach drove up the avenue; they were per|fectly &s;erene. My uncle very politely, but not without &s;ome little di&s;compo|&s;ure, came to help her out of the coach. With an unaltered cheek, and an air perfectly ea&s;y, &s;he gave him her hand; and as he led her up the &s;tairs, addre&s;&s;|ed &s;ome indifferent conver&s;ation to him, which he an&s;wered with great gravity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we entered the room, &s;he pre&s;ented her two daughters and her little boy to him. The girls are pretty and genteel. He gave them an oblig|ing reception, and care&s;&s;ed the boy, who is extremely like his brother.</P>
<P>DURING this ceremony Mr. Greville remained &s;ilent, ob&s;erving all that pa&s;&s;ed with a fixed attention. Mr. Harley had
<PB N="55" REF="57">
drawn me to a window, to li&s;ten to &s;ome tender trifles, which, I con&s;e&s;s, intere&s;ted me much le&s;s than the &s;cene between Mrs. Harley and my uncle.</P>
<P>SHE had not neglected her dre&s;s, which, being &s;econd mourning, admit|ed &s;ome elegances very advantageous to her per&s;on; and &s;he &s;eemed &s;till con|&s;cious of its attractions, and to think they had not yet lo&s;t all their force upon a heart which was once en&s;laved by them.</P>
<P>SIR John, taken up with the chil|dren, had not yet met her looks, which, armed with all their fa&s;cinating powers, were level led full at him, as he now, for the fir&s;t time, railed his eyes to her &s;ace; but he &s;tood the &s;hock with &s;uch unaffected compo&s;ure and indif|ference, as &s;eemed to mortify her a little; however, &s;he &s;oon recovered her|&s;elf, and the conver&s;ation becoming ge|neral
<PB N="56" REF="58">
my uncle mixed in it with his u&s;ual good humour and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>At night, when I left her in her apartment, &s;he embraced me with great tenderne&s;s, and &s;eemed perfectly &s;ati&s;|fied with the progre&s;s &s;he had made that day in her de&s;ign of plea&s;ing; for va|nity is ea&s;ily fed, and the many little engaging arts &s;he practi&s;ed, to draw my uncle's notice upon her, &s;ometimes pro|duced their effect, and gave to tho&s;e attentions, which politene&s;s demanded of him, a certain gallant air, which &s;he explained as &s;he plea&s;ed;.</P>
<P>SHE had continued a fortnight at the Hall, without giving the lea&s;t intima|tion when &s;he meant to put an end to her vi&s;it. Her de&s;ign upon my uncle's heart &s;eemed apparent; Mr. Greville looked grave upon it.&mdash;And one day, after heedfully ob&s;erving her manner, he drew me a&s;ide to a window.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">'WHAT can this woman mean,' &s;aid he, <Q>by the airs &s;he gives her&s;elf? Har|ley had need to look about him; or he may have the &s;ingular good fortune to be cut out of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the &s;elfi&s;h views of a mother.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was carrying his &s;u&s;picions very far. I combated them for the honour of my &s;ex. But reflecting upon Mrs. Harley's ungenerous conduct in the early part of her life, the thing did not &s;eem improbable.</P>
<P>MR. Greville protracted his vi&s;it to an uncon&s;cionable length, as he him&s;elf ob&s;erved, that he might not leave his friend expo&s;ed without &s;uccour to &s;uch a dangerous attack. I could perceive that his pre&s;ence often checked Mrs. Harley in her career of coquetry, and that &s;he wi&s;hed his ab&s;cence mo&s;t de|voutly; for he watched her motions &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, that &s;he could, never, gain
<PB N="58" REF="60">
an opportunity of being with Sir John alone.</P>
<P>HE was boa&s;ting of his dexterous ma|nagement, on this occa&s;ion, one day as he was &s;tanding with me at one of the windows of my dre&s;&s;ing-room, which overlooked the terrace, when I pointed out to him Mrs. Harley and my uncle walking together, engaged, as it &s;eemed, in a very &s;erious conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>'How could this happen?' &s;aid he, with &s;ome emotion. <Q>I left Sir John in his library; and Mrs. Harley, you &s;aid, complained of &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition this morning. Well, I am re&s;olved to interrupt them, however.</Q> He took his hat immediately, and cro&s;&s;ing the terrace, as if he meant to go into one of the alleys, my uncle called to him, and he joined them, not greatly to the &s;atisfaction of Mrs. Harley, as he told me afterwards, which appeared too plainly by her looks.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">THESE t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te airings became, at length very frequent; and Mr. Har|ley, charmed with the good intelligence that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between his mother and Sir John, implored me to con&s;ent to his making u&s;e of her growing intere&s;t with him, to pre&s;s the conclu&s;ion of our marriage; a &s;ubject he could not take the liberty to enter upon him&s;elf. This, for obvious rea&s;ons, I would not con&s;ent to; &s;o that there were &s;ome di&s;contented faces among us. I could not approve of Mrs. Harley's behaviour; Mr. Gre|ville was enraged at it; and her &s;on &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive of delays, without knowing why.</P>
<P>THINGS were in this &s;tate, when one day, after a long conver&s;ation with Mrs. Harley in private, my uncle &s;ent for me into his library, and immediately afterwards, de&s;ired a &s;ervant to tell Mr. Greville he wanted to &s;peak with him. Upon his entrance, my uncle &s;hutting the door after him, took his hand, and
<PB N="60" REF="62">
leading him up to the window where I &s;tood, wondering what this preparation was to end in.</P>
<P>'I WISHED to con&s;ult you both,' &s;aid he, <Q>upon a matter which pre&s;&s;es my thoughts very much. I know not whether what I have re&s;olved on will meet with your approbation; but I am &s;ure I mean well; and the world&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>'PRITHEE, my good friend,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, interrupting him impa|tiently, <Q>tell us the matter without any further preface. If you have re&s;olved, why let the world talk. &mdash;It is not the fir&s;t time it has talked, you know.</Q></P>
<P>'OF what?' replied my uncle, a lit|tle &s;urpri&s;ed. <Q>The world knows no|thing of my intentions in this ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>'OH, no,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, &s;miling, <Q>but the world is very good at gue&s;&s;ing &s;ometimes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">'You are part of this world,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>tell me what hae you gue&s;&s;ed, that I may know whether I have an&s;wered, or fallen &s;hort of your expectations.</Q></P>
<P>'I GUESS then,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>that in this bu&s;ine&s;s, you have followed your inclinations; and in that re|&s;pect, I am &s;ure, you have not fallen &s;hort of my expectations.</Q></P>
<P>My uncle did not perceive that the&s;e words were &s;poken rather peevi&s;hly; he took them in a very favourable &s;en&s;e; and with a &s;mile of complacency, re|plied&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>IT would be a very &s;en&s;ible mortifi|cation to me to be condemned by a judgment, which it would lie heavy on my con&s;cience not to &s;ub&s;cribe to. My dear Edward, I am afraid, mur|murs in &s;ecret, that I have delayed his happine&s;s &s;o long.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">'IT is a maxim with me,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>never to be long in doing that which can be done but once. But I can an&s;wer for your Edward, that, with all the impatience of a lover, he has all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reverence of a &s;on. However, I hope he will never be more than your nephew.</Q></P>
<P>'How is that?' &s;aid my uncle, ha&s;tily, <Q>I prote&s;t, I do not under&s;tand what you drive at, Greville. But if, as Edward's friend, you are chagrined at my delaying his marriage, hear my rea&s;ons. &mdash;I was willing, before this event took place, to &s;et him entirely at ea&s;e with regard to the &s;ituation of his mother and his family; and by mak|ing them independent, to prevent any further claims upon him, which, per|haps, might not be regulated by rea&s;on on one &s;ide, nor prudence on the other.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65"><Q>FOR this purpo&s;e, I have &s;ought op|portunities of engaging Mrs. Harley's attention on this &s;ubject; but it is hard to gue&s;s at this woman's meaning. An affair of &s;uch importance to her &s;he treats with the mo&s;t childi&s;h carle&s;&s;|ne&s;s, and turns the di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ubjects which have not the lea&s;t con|nexion with it, and tri&s;les in &s;o egre|gious a manner, that I was almo&s;t out of patience with her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS morning, however, I de|manded her attention, in a deci&s;ive tone, to what I had to &s;ay to her, on &s;ubjects of importance to her&s;elf and her family. I began with telling her, my re&s;olution to complete the marriage between my niece and her &s;on (her worthy &s;on I ju&s;tly called him) in a few weeks.</Q></P>
<P>'BY the way, Maria,' pur&s;ued my uncle, looking at me (which this la&s;t hint had, as you may imagine, thrown me
<PB N="64" REF="66">
into a little confu&s;ion) <Q>I believe you are not &s;o great a favourite with her as you might rea&s;onably expect, for &s;he received this plain declaration of my intentions, with a cold civility that &s;urpri&s;ed me.</Q></P>
<P>I SMILED, and was &s;ilent; but Mr. Greville &s;aid, <Q>Aye, aye, this is natural enough; it is our&s;elves that we gene|rally love in others; but where there is no re&s;emblance, there is no founda|tion for partiality.</Q></P>
<P>'I BELIEVE you are right,' replied my uncle. <Q>However, I pa&s;&s;ed over this circum&s;tance, and proceeded to tell her, that I had re&s;olved to &s;ettle two thou&s;and pounds on each of her daughters, and, if &s;he had no objec|tion, would place them at the &s;ame boarding-&s;chool where my niece was brought up, and take the expence of their education upon my&s;elf. As for little Charles, who is really a promi&s;ing
<PB N="65" REF="67">
boy, Greville, I told her, it was my intention to breed him up a &s;cholar; that he &s;hould be educated in my own hou&s;e, under the tuition of my chap|lain, till he was fit for the univer&s;ity; and as I de&s;igned him, with her con|currence, for the church, I would keep the living of&mdash;, which his father had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, vacant for him; and for future preferment, he would have all his brother's intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>'To all this,' pur&s;ued my uncle, <Q>Mrs. Harley made no other an&s;wer than to bow her head; which appeared a &s;acrifice to politene&s;s, rather than an expre&s;&s;ion of approbation; &s;o that being a little embarra&s;&s;ed by her be|haviour, I entered rather abruptly in|to an explanation of my intentions with regard to her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>'YOUR income, Madam,' &s;aid I, <Q>I propo&s;e to increa&s;e, by a &s;ettlement of two hundred pounds a year, which I
<PB N="66" REF="68">
hope you will think adequate to your occa&s;ions; and now, the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary preliminaries being &s;ettled, we have nothing to do but to make preparations for the marriage of our children.</Q></P>
<P>WHILE my uncle was &s;peaking, &s;e|veral &s;elf-accu&s;ing glances pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Mr. Greville and me; although we had never explicitly declared to each other the &s;u&s;picions the&s;e long and pri|vate conver&s;ations with Mrs. Harley had &s;ugge&s;ted; yet, con&s;cious that we had really entertained &s;uch injuriousthoughts of him, our hearts upbraided us with inju&s;tice; and my emotions impelled me to ca&s;t my&s;elf at his feet, to implore his pardon for my offence.</P>
<P>I CHECKED this involuntary tran&s;port, however; but was delighted to &s;ee Mr. Greville give way to his &s;en&s;ibility; he embraced my uncle eagerly, crying, <Q>You have acted like your&s;elf, wi&s;ely, nobly, greatly!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">'OH! mighty well,' &s;aid my uncle, <Q>I am glad you are plea&s;ed. But what think you was the lady's an&s;wer? Why truly, &s;he pau&s;ed a little, dropt me a formal curt&s;ey, and &s;aid, &s;he would con&s;ider of what I had been &s;aying.</Q></P>
<P>'WHY truly,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, <Q>it required &s;ome time to deliberate, whe|ther &s;he would accept a genteel portion for her daughters; a plentiful income for her&s;elf; and a certain provi&s;ion for her little &s;on. &mdash;The matter was &s;ome|thing difficult.</Q></P>
<P>'WELL, I have done my part,' in|terrupted my uncle. <Q>And now, my dear Greville, find out Edward, and bring him to me; and as for you, niece, I &s;hall leave it to your lover to prevail upon you to fix an early day for his, and, I hope, your happine&s;s.</Q> &mdash;I curt&s;ied in &s;ilence, and left the room.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">RETIRING to my own apartment, I &s;aw Mr. Harley cro&s;&s;ing the gallery to go into his mother's chamber. He did not &s;ee me, and I took no notice of him, being unwilling to interrupt a conver&s;ation that was likely to lead to a di&s;covery of his mother's &s;entiments, which appeared to me to be very mi&s;|terious. I &s;at alone till the hour of tea approached; when I went into the drawing-room, where I found Mr. Har|ley alone, leaning on the back of a chair, his arms folded and lo&s;t in thought. On my entrance, he &s;tarted up, and running to me, took my hand, which he ki&s;&s;ed with great emotion.</P>
<P>'HAVE you heard, my Maria,' &s;aid he, <Q>how your generous, your noble uncle, means to provide for my mo|ther and her family?</Q> 'I have,' &s;aid I, <Q>and I hope Mrs. Harley is quite &s;a|tisfied with his plan.</Q> He ca&s;t his eyes down in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and was
<PB N="69" REF="71">
&s;ilent a moment; then dropping my hand with an air of de&s;pondency&mdash;</P>
<P>'HOW will it be po&s;&s;ible for me,' ex|claimed he, <Q>to bear her an&s;wer to Sir John! &mdash;Would you think it, my dear Maria, my mother, brought up in the principles of the Roman Catholic religion, is &s;o bigoted to her mode of faith, that, rather than not carry her point, &s;he will ri&s;k the di&s;plea&s;ure of her benefactor, and the lo&s;s of her children's hopes; and is unkind enough to in&s;i&s;t upon my acquainting Sir John with her intentidns.</Q></P>
<P>'And what are the&s;e intentions?' &s;aid I.</P>
<P>'To retire to France,' replied he, <Q>with my brother and &s;i&s;ters; and take upon her&s;elf the care of their education.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72"><Q>AND &s;o &s;he means to make your &s;i&s;ters nuns, and your brother a friar,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Greville, who had &s;tolen upon us unob&s;erved, and heard Mr. Harley's la&s;t words. 'But come,' pur&s;ued he, <Q>I have been looking for you, Sir John expects you in the library; he has or|dered coffee there, &s;o we &s;hall not at|tend your tea-table this afternoon, young lady,</Q> &s;aid he to me.</P>
<P>THEY went away together; and I &s;ent to let Mrs. Harley know I waited tea for her; &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf on account of &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition; but her daugh|ters, and her little &s;on came to me.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ages of the day gave my thoughts &s;uch full employment, that I was but a dull companion for my little vi&s;it|ors; &s;o I went with them into the gar|den, and leaving them to &s;troll about as they plea&s;ed, retired to an alcove to indulge my meditations. I had not
<PB N="71" REF="73">
been here more than half an hour, when I &s;aw Mr. Harley, joy &s;parkling in his eyes, advancing ha&s;tily towards me; I ro&s;e to meet him at the entrance of the alcove; but he prevented my going out; and taking my hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, with equal tenderne&s;s and re|&s;pect, led me back to my &s;eat, at the &s;ame in&s;tant throwing him&s;elf at my feet. I de&s;ired him to ri&s;e, with a &s;mile, which he well under&s;tood.</P>
<P><Q>OH! pardon the tran&s;ports of a lover,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>who finding him&s;elf authori&s;ed to pre&s;s you to conclude his happine&s;s, can think no po&s;ture too humble for &s;uch a reque&s;t. Do not, my adored Maria, be le&s;s favour|able to my ardent wi&s;hes than your uncle. &mdash;He bids me bring him your con&s;ent for an early day, to conclude our marriage. Can you, will you not an&s;wer his generous intentions?</Q> <Q>Me|thinks,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>Mrs. Harley ought to decide in this matter&mdash;I will be
<PB N="72" REF="74">
directed by her.</Q> <Q>Say rather by your uncle,</Q> interrupted he, <Q>your more than father, my glorious friend and benefactor, &s;ay by him.</Q> 'Well then,' re&s;umed I, <Q>let my uncle determine for me.</Q></P>
<P>THIS conce&s;&s;ion produced new tran&s;|ports; which I checked, by a&s;king him, how Sir John had received Mrs. Harley's propo&s;als?</P>
<P>'Mr. Greville,' &s;aid he, <Q>took upon him to acquaint Sir John with my mother's fatal in&s;atuation.</Q> &mdash;<Q>And how,</Q> &s;aid I eagerly, <Q>how has he de|termined in con&s;equence of it?</Q></P>
<P>'LIKE him&s;elf,' replied he, <Q>with equal dignity and ju&s;tice. &mdash;He con|&s;ents to my &s;i&s;ters going to France with my mother, &s;ince &s;he will have it &s;o; but in&s;i&s;ts upon her leaving my brother to my care, as my father with his la&s;t breath directed.</Q> I fore&s;ee,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
&s;aid he, &s;ighing, <Q>that this will produce &s;ome conte&s;t between my mother and me. Having always been u&s;ed to pay her the utmo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect, it will be a painful ta&s;k to contradict her.</Q></P>
<P>'But &s;urely,' replied I, <Q>the con|&s;ideration of her own intere&s;t, and that of the child, will have &s;ome weight with her, be&s;ides the will of her late hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P>'AH! again&s;t that,' interrupted Mr. Harley, <Q>&s;he pleads the will of Heaven. Her church allows no &s;alvation out of its own pale; and &s;he thinks it would be a le&s;s misfortune to &s;ee her child poor and dependent, than a heretic.</Q></P>
<P>'SHE is to be pitied,' &s;aid I, <Q>&s;ince her error is founded upon principle.</Q> He pre&s;&s;ed my hand with ardour, upon my &s;aying this.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">'HOW excellently good are you,' &s;aid he, <Q>to view in &s;o favourable a light my mother's conduct on this occa&s;ion. I never was &s;o happy as to enjoy an equal portion of her affection with any of her other children&mdash;but I love her mo&s;t tenderly; and mu&s;t re|gret a &s;eparation, which being her choice, proves her indifference to|wards me.</Q></P>
<P>I WAS greatly moved with the affecti|onate manner in which, he &s;poke the&s;e words, heightened by a look of extreme &s;en&s;ibility. This cloud, however, was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed by the &s;un&s;hine, as he called it, of his pre&s;ent fortune; and, till we joined our little companions, he breathed nothing but the warme&s;t e&s;&s;u|&s;ions of gratitude, love, and joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, in the mean time, had paid a vi&s;it to Mrs. Harley, in her own apartment; and had di&s;po&s;ed her, by arguments which he well knew how to
<PB N="75" REF="77">
enforce, to an aquie&s;cence with my uncle's intentions with regard to her little &s;on; it was a &s;ullen acquie&s;cence, however; for &s;he appeared at &s;upper with looks &s;o cold and re&s;erved, as dis|concerted us all.</P>
<P>SIR John, in a formal accent, and a look compo&s;ed to great gravity, told her, that if &s;he had no objection, he had fixed upon this day fortnight for the celebration of our marriage. Cer|tainly, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he could have no ob|jection; and turning to me, made me &s;ome common-place compliments, but delivered with &s;urpri&s;ing coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>MY uncle added, that he intended the ceremony &s;hould pa&s;s with great privacy; and that all our parade &s;hould be re&s;erved for our appearance in town, the en&s;uing winter, whither he propo&s;ed to accompany us.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">DEAR generous man! My heart overflowed with gratitude; which was &s;ufficiently apparent in my looks, I be|lieve; for he &s;everal times &s;miled upon me with great complacency. Mr. Har|ley's acknowledgments were expre&s;&s;ed with a fervor which &s;eemed to move him much, and were an&s;wered by a mo&s;t affectionate embrace.</P>
<P>MY uncle &s;ettles upon Mr. Harley twelve hundred pounds a year. &mdash;We are to live with him at the Hall; and it is in our own choice to &s;pend the whole, or part, of every winter in London; a permi&s;&s;ion I &s;hall &s;eldom make u&s;e of; becau&s;e the air of that crowded city does not agree with his health; and it is equally my inclination, and my duty, to be ab&s;ent from him as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>WHILE all the&s;e arrangements were making, Mrs. Harley appeared to take
<PB N="77" REF="79">
very little intere&s;t in them, and kept a profound &s;ilence. Her &s;on could with difficulty conceal his confu&s;ion at this behaviour; he often turned his expre&s;|&s;ive eyes upon her, full of re&s;pectful expo&s;tulation; which &s;he did not, or would nor, under&s;tand. When we &s;e|parated for the night, &s;he told Sir John, that as her &s;on's marriage was to be ce|lebrated <HI>&s;o &s;oon,</HI> it would be nece&s;&s;ary for her to go home for a few days, in order to make &s;ome preparations for her own and her daughters appearance; and that &s;he propo&s;ed to &s;et out early in the morning. My uncle made no op|po&s;ition to this de&s;ign, &s;o &s;uddenly taken up, but gave orders for the coach to attend her at what hour &s;he plea&s;ed, together with Martin and two of the footmen. She thanked him with a cold politene&s;s; and when I waited on her to her chamber, told me, with a forced &s;mile, that &s;he hoped I would have no objection to her &s;on's accompanying her, at lea&s;t part of the way.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">I BLUSHED, and an&s;wered with &s;ome confu&s;ion, <Q>Surely, Madam, I can have no objection to Mr. Harley's do|ing what his affection and his duty require of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>OH! you are very obliging, my dear Mi&s;s,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, and curt&s;eying very ceremoniou&s;ly, wi&s;hed me a good. night.</P>
<P>I DESIRED to know, at what hour &s;he intended to &s;et out in the morning, that I might attend her at breakfa&s;t. She &s;aid, &s;he would &s;end to me as &s;oon as &s;he was ri&s;en; and we parted.</P>
<P>I ROSE earlier than u&s;ual the next morning, but &s;till not time enough to &s;ee Mrs. Harley; for my maid informed me, &s;he had been gone half an hour; for as &s;oon as I had left her at night, &s;he &s;ent for her &s;on, and de&s;ired him to give directions for the coach to be ready at five o'clock. He had acquainted my
<PB N="79" REF="81">
uncle with his intentions, of conducting his mother as far, as &mdash; in her way home, and promi&s;ed to return by dinner time. Mrs. Harley's behaviour had been &s;o extraordinary, that I ex|pected my uncle would have taken &s;ome notice of it to me; but, whatever his thoughts were, he kept them to him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. Greville told me, that he was convinced, her &s;ullenne&s;s was occa&s;i|oned by the di&s;appointment of her de|&s;igns upon Sir John. <Q>Her confidence in her own charms,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is pro|digiou&s;ly great; and the power they once had over the heart of my friend, per&s;uaded her, that it would be no difficult matter to revive a pa&s;&s;ion, which the re&s;entment he had pre&s;erved again&s;t her hu&s;band, for &s;upplanting him, by continuing his whole life, proved that it had never been quite extingui&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82"><Q>SELFISH and intere&s;ted, to the la&s;t degree, a title had allurements &s;uffi|cient to make her in&s;en&s;ible to the in|jury &s;he was preparing for the mo&s;t amiable and mo&s;t de&s;erving of &s;ons, by cutting him, perhaps, out of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and, perhaps, the pro|&s;pect, in ca&s;e &s;he had &s;ucceeded, of a long minority, had its weight with her. I know,</Q> pur&s;ued he, <Q>Sir John views her conduct in the &s;ame light that I do; but he has too much delicacy to explain him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>IT was painful to me to feel, for the mother of Mr. Harley, tho&s;e emotions of contempt and di&s;like, which &s;uch a conduct naturally in&s;pired. I could not conceal my a&s;toni&s;hment at it.</P>
<P>'THIS woman,' &s;aid he, <Q>never had any &s;en&s;ibility. They who blu&s;h not at their faults, but add confidence to their guilt, have no motive left to re|&s;tore them to the practice of virtue.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">MR. Harley did not return to dinner; at which we were not much &s;urpri&s;ed; as it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that in con|ducting his mother on her way, he might exceed the limits he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf. But when night came, and he did not appear, my uncle became un|ea&s;y; and I, I own it, was gretly alarmed. I retired to my chamber, to conceal emotions it was not in my power to &s;uppre&s;s. Either he neglects me, thought I, or &s;ome fatal accident has happened to him.</P>
<P>I PASSED a con&s;iderable time in this &s;tate of anxiety, when one of the foot|men came back, and related, that Mr. Harley had been &s;ddenly taken ill at an inn, where they &s;topped for &s;ome re|fre&s;hment; and that his mother had thought proper to take him home to her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As not a &s;ingle line came from Mr. Harley on this occa&s;ion, we concluded
<PB N="82" REF="84">
he mu&s;t certainly be in a very danger|ous way. The &s;ervant either could not, or would not, give us any certain ac|count, &s;o that we all pa&s;&s;ed an unea&s;y night.</P>
<P>THE next day, ju&s;t as my uncle was going to &s;end one of the grooms to Mrs. Harley's, we &s;aw Martin arrive. My uncle and Mr. Greville had not pa|tience to wait till he entered the hou&s;e, but ha&s;tened to meet him. I remained in the room where they had left me in great anxiety, and trembling for the event.</P>
<P>MR. Greville returned in a minute&mdash; 'Do not be alarmed,' &s;aid he, ha&s;tily, <Q>our friend is in no danger; though he is indi&s;po&s;ed&mdash;I flew to tell you this, which is all. I have yet heard.</Q> He left me in&s;tantly, to go to my uncle; who had ordered Martin to follow him to his library, where he was giving him an account of what had happened.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">THE few words he had uttered, &s;eemed to have removed a mountain from my brea&s;t, I began to breathe again; and for a few minutes enjoyed &s;ome little compo&s;ure; but doubts and fears re|turned, and I was beginning to relap&s;e into all my former inquietude, when Mr. Greville again entered; and draw|ing a chair clo&s;e to me&mdash; 'Now,' &s;aid he, <Q>you &s;hall know all that has pa&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>'AH!' &s;aid I, with an emotion which I was not aware of, <Q>you have deceived me&mdash;What is become of Mr. Harley? What fatal accident has happened?</Q> &mdash; He &s;miled. That &s;mile relieved my fears; but awakened me to a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, at the tran&s;port to which I had &s;o indi&s;creetly given way.</P>
<P>'NOTHING,' &s;aid Mr. Greville, gravely, ob&s;erving my confu&s;ion, <Q>that we &s;uffer, is &s;o bad as what we fear. Mr. Har|ley is not well enough to be with us
<PB N="84" REF="86">
to-day, but we &s;hall certainly &s;ee him to-morrow. Martin tells us, that his di&s;order was occa&s;ioned by a conte&s;t he was obliged to &s;u&s;tain with his mother, who&s;e violent temper is well known. She obliged him, after they had travelled a few miles, to di&s;|mount, and come into the coach to her. &mdash;There an altercation en&s;ued, &s;o very lively, as to be heard di&s;tinctly by the &s;ervants, and particularly by Martin, who rode &s;ometimes very near the coach. The &s;ubject was, Sir John's ungenerous u&s;e of the power her dependent &s;ituation gave him over her, in taking her younge&s;t &s;on out of her hands. She &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to conte&s;t this point with him: and upon Mr. Harley mode&s;tly, yet &s;teadily, in&s;i&s;ting upon his fulfilling the la&s;t in|junctions of his father, with regard to this child, his mother &s;et no bounds to her rage, but loaded him with the &s;evere&s;t reproaches.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"><Q>MR. Harley finding all his expo&s;tu|lations, intreaties, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, were employed in vain to bring her to a better temper, reminded her of his promi&s;e to return to the Hall to dinner; and &s;topping the coach, or|dered the &s;ervant, who led his hor&s;e, to come up.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A VERY good inn being in &s;ight; Mrs. Harley peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon his dining with her on the road; which he complied with, in hopes, as it &s;hould &s;eem, of leaving her more compo&s;ed. But after dinner, the &s;torm began with more violence than before. She ordered him, with an imprious air, to accompany her home. He pleaded his promi&s;e to Sir John; and a&s;&s;ured her, if &s;he would permit him to leave her then, he would re|turn to her the next day. This me|dium &s;he refu&s;ed; and continuing to rail, in the mo&s;t indecent terms, again&s;t all he mo&s;t loved and revered
<PB N="86" REF="88">
in the world, a thou&s;and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to rend his heart; his tongue maintained a re&s;pectful &s;ilence, but his inward agitations were apparently very violent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>MRS. Harley now ordered the hor&s;es to be put to the coach, and with an imperious air bid her &s;on, as he handed her into it, to come in like|wi&s;e; he begged to be excu&s;ed; and mounting his hor&s;e, rode on before, &s;o &s;wiftly, that he was pre&s;ently out of &s;ight. A heavy &s;hower of rain now fell, and continued &s;o long, and with &s;uch violence, that it was appre|hended Mr. Harley would &s;uffer greatly, unle&s;s he found &s;helter &s;ome|where, which was not likely, as there was no inn upon the road, from thence to the par&s;onage hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE coachman drove furio&s;ly, in order to overtake him; and accord|ingly they came up with him; but he
<PB N="87" REF="89">
had alighted, tied his hor&s;e to a tree, under which he &s;tood him&s;elf, drenched through with the rain. In this wet condition, he was prevailed upon to come into the coach; and after an hour's ride they reached the par&s;onage hou&s;e. Mr. Harley, who had not ut|tered a &s;ingle word all the time he was in the coach, de&s;ired a bed to be pre|pared for him; and bowing low to his mother, retired; apparently &s;o ill, that &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for the apothecary of the village, who, after vi&s;iting him, pronounced him to be feveri&s;h, and ordered him &s;ome medicines. Martin, however, rode to the next town to get a phy&s;ician; who thought his &s;ever rather high, but did not apprehend any dangerous con|&s;equences from it. He had a tolerable night, it &s;eems; and the next morn|ing calling Martin to his bed-&s;ide, directed him what account he was to give to Sir John concerning the ac|cident that detained him. Accord|ingly
<PB N="88" REF="90">
Sir John is but half-informed of the truth, added Mr. Greville, and what I have told you, the hone&s;t and dis;creet old man imparted to me in private.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Greville accounts very naturally for this violent conduct in Mrs. Harley. &mdash;Her pride, mortified by the indiffer|ence of Sir John; her ambitious views di&s;appointed, &s;he propo&s;ed to her&s;elf a malicious plea&s;ure in interrupting that happine&s;s which &s;he could not participate.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help agreeing with Mr. Greville, that a woman &s;o ra&s;h, fo &s;elfi&s;h, and imprudent, is not fit to have the guidance of any of her children. But &s;he will never yield to per&s;ua&s;ions. <Q>It is &s;uperfluous to employ rea&s;on with tho&s;e that have none,</Q> &s;ays he; <Q>&s;he mu&s;t be forced to comply. Extremes are always dangerous; but they be|come wi&s;e means, when they are ne|ce&s;&s;ary.
<PB N="89" REF="91">
It is true, indeed, they never work by halves, but will decide the matter one way or other.</Q></P>
<P>My uncle could not be &s;atisfied with the favourable account Martin brought of Mr. Harley's pre&s;ent condition; he &s;eemed determined to go and &s;ee him, and to carry his own phy&s;ician with him; but Mr. Greville, apprehen&s;ive that Mrs. Harley might give him &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, prevailed upon him to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of this journey him|&s;elf, and con&s;ent to his going with the doctor; who was immediately &s;ent to; and they both went away early in the morning.</P>
<P>This was a melancholy interval. Fear is a great magnifier of evils, &mdash;My uncle rea&s;oned &s;o long upon the pro|bable con&s;equences of what had hap|pened to Mr. Harley, that he almo&s;t reduced me to de&s;pair. The doctor's return re&s;tored us to &s;ome degree of
<PB N="90" REF="92">
tranquillity; he affured us, that Mr. Harley was in no degree of danger, and that we might expecl to &s;ee him the next day, Mr. Greville &s;taying to ac|company him. His arrival was impa|tiently expected by my uncle, who obliged me to walk with him &s;everal times down the avenue, in hopes of meeting the carriage.</P>
<P>ALAS! it came not that day, nor the next; but the &s;ervants, who were di&s;|patched each day to the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, always brought us favourable accounts from Mr. Greyille, which, however, contributed but little to the relief of our anxiety; and my uncle, now determined to &s;et out him&s;elf, which I no longer oppo&s;ed. While his po&s;t-chai&s;e was getting ready, we took our u&s;ual melan|choly walk, and, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, the carriage appeared in &s;ight. &mdash; My uncle left me, and, forgetting his gout, actually ran towards it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">MR. Harley got out, and threw him|&s;elf into his arms. When I came up to them, I was amazed at the alteration I perceived in his countenance. Joy, at the &s;ight of me, over&s;pread his face with a faint blu&s;h, which in&s;tantly gave place to an a&s;hy palene&s;s. &mdash;His eyes had lo&s;t their &s;parkling vivacity; but they &s;till retained that melting &s;oftne&s;s with which his partiality always beheld me.</P>
<P>THE &s;ight of him, thus altered, af|fected me &s;o much, that I could have, wept like an infant, had not &s;hame re|&s;trained me. My uncle would needs &s;upport him as he walked to the hou&s;e. Mr. Greville, as we followed them, took an opportunity to tell me, that Mrs. Harley was much altered in her behaviour; that &s;he was perfectly com|plai&s;ant, docile, and obliging; and ready to approve of every arrangement, in her own and her children's affairs, which Sir John &s;hould think fit to pro|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">'WEAK per&s;ons,' he ob&s;erved, <Q>never yield at the time they ought to do. It was not po&s;&s;ible for her to recover the ground &s;he had lo&s;t by her former violence; but as her pre&s;ent conduct &s;eemed to promi&s;e no farther oppo&s;i|tion, we had rea&s;on to be contended.</Q></P>
<P>SIR John took not the lea&s;t notice of her behaviour to Mr. Harley, but em|ployed all his attention in forwarding his recovery; and, indeed, he mends &s;o fa&s;t, that we have rea&s;on to hope, his health will &s;oon be perfectly re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>My dear Euphemia, good fortune, as well as evil accidents, &s;eldom come alone. I have this moment your dear, your welcome packet. Sir John's agent in London took care to forward it to me by one of his clerks, who is to take back what letters I have ready.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="95">A SHIP for New-York, he tells me, being to &s;ail immediately, I have but ju&s;t time to run it over; and, to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, I find you have had an agreeable voyage, are well, and not unhappy. What a fea&s;t do you pre|pare for me, by writing thus to the mo|ment, and making me pre&s;ent to all the occurrences of your life. &mdash;All, all are of con&s;equence to me! Heaven grant, that you may never &s;end me le&s;s plea&s;ing news! You cannot complain, nor be unhappy, by your&s;elf alone; I partake of all your good or evil fortune; and feel &s;o lively a reflexion of any unea&s;i|ne&s;s you &s;uffer, that there needs but one blow to give two wounds.</P>
<P>My uncle interrupts me, to tell me, the me&s;&s;enger waits for my packet. &mdash;He &s;ends a thou&s;and kind remem|brances to you. You know what a favourite you are with Mr. Greville; he forgot, that it is not decent for a wi&s;e man to be tran&s;ported with joy
<PB N="94" REF="96">
or grief, on any occa&s;ion whatever, but the news of your health, and &s;afe arrival at your de&s;tined port, threw him &s;o much off his guard, that he di&s;covered little le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. Harley would fain have me believe, that he admires and loves you as much as I do; but that is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e, he does not know you as well. &mdash;But he begs me to tell you, that he joins with me, in every fond and tender wi&s;h for your health and happine&s;s. &mdash;Adieu, my ever loved and valued friend&mdash;Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it po&s;&s;ible for me to be le&s;s intere&s;ted than 1 am in all your concerns, yet your agreeable narrative would have acted very powerfully upon my hopes and fears. When I reflect upon &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages you have related, I cannot help&s;miling at the blunders which di&s;tance produces. At the very mo|ment when I had rea&s;on to fear that fortune was preparing &s;ome ob&s;tacles to your happine&s;s, that happine&s;s was al|ready &s;ecured; and I hope and believe, that you were then the wife of that no|ble and generous youth who only could de&s;erve you.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">I shall be very glad to hear that Mrs. Harley pur&s;ues her intention of retiring to France; a mother-in-law of her complexion will be be&s;t conciliated at a di&s;tance. Ceremony between per|&s;ons &s;o nearly connected, but ill &s;upplies the place of cordiality and friend&s;hip, and leaves a craving void in the heart, which will &s;ometimes be filled with peevi&s;hne&s;s and di&s;content; and a for|mal civility is all that can &s;ub&s;i&s;t between characters &s;o oppo&s;ite as yours and hers.</P>
<P>IN Mrs. Bellenden, this acquired qua|lity of politene&s;s is almo&s;t a virtue; and indeed it has the &s;emblance of many&mdash; it makes her patient with ab&s;urdity, gen|tle with impertinence, forgiving with rudene&s;s, and ea&s;y with all per&s;ons and on all occa&s;ions. You would admire her plea&s;ing behaviour, and the grace with which &s;he accommodates her&s;elf to the boori&s;h manners of the men, and the awkward ignorance of the women of
<PB N="98" REF="100">
this place. She has actually taken a great deal of pains to acquire as much knowledge of the Dutch language as to enable her to addre&s;s &s;ome trifling con|ver&s;ation to the&s;e uncouth vi&s;itants, with whom the young ladies are &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted, that they have contriv|ed to keep them out of the a&s;&s;embly Mrs. Bellenden holds every fortnight, which is now pretty numerous, from the re&s;ort of many &s;trangers of fa&s;hion to this city.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e Mr. Eu&s;ton holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank; elegant in his per|&s;on, polite in his manners, and engag|ing in his addre&s;s: he throws off the philo&s;opher in the charming circle form|ed by the Colonel's daughters. Mi&s;s Bellenden has thought him worthy of her chains, and calls forth all her attrac|tions to en&s;lave him. The dignified Loui&s;a looks as if his adorations might be <HI>endured;</HI> and Clara, without &s;eem|ing to have the lea&s;t de&s;ign upon his
<PB N="99" REF="101">
heart, aims only at improving her un|der&s;tanding, by li&s;tening with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention to all he &s;ays, when any opportunity offers to engage him in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Two nights ago Mrs. Bellenden gave a ball and &s;upper, on occa&s;ion of the arrival of a young gentleman, &s;on to the late governor of New-York, who is ap|pointed third lieutenant to the Colonel. We had &s;ome mu&s;ic; all the young la|dies &s;ing and play, and Mrs. Bellenden does both excellently.</P>
<P>MR. Neville and my&s;elf were among the performers; but nobody thought of a&s;king the philo&s;ophic Mr. Eu&s;ton to make one. Mrs. Bellenden, however, heedfully ob&s;erving him during the per|formance of Dryden's Ode on St. Ceci|lia's Day, exclaimed&mdash; <Q>I am &s;ure Mr. Eu&s;ton under&s;tands mu&s;ic!</Q> &mdash; He &s;miled.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102">'Ah! I thought &s;o,' pur&s;ued &s;he; <Q>come, Sir, I in&s;i&s;t upon your joining us.</Q> Mi&s;s Bellenden ro&s;e immedi|ately from the harp&s;ichord, and offered her place; and Mr. Neville pre&s;ented his German flute. Mr. Eu&s;ton cho&s;e the harp&s;ichord; and &s;itting down, &s;ung that beautiful little &s;ong of Ben John|&s;on's in the Silent Woman, which you know I admire &s;o much.</P>
<Q><L>Still to be fine, &s;till to be dre&s;t,</L>
<L>As you were going to a fea&s;t:</L>
<L>Still to be powdered, &s;till perfum'd,</L>
<L>Lady, it is to be pre&s;um'd,</L>
<L>Tho' art's hid cau&s;es are not found,</L>
<L>All is not <HI>genuine,</HI> all not &s;ound:</L>
<L>Give me a look, give me a face</L>
<L>That makes &s;implicity a grace;</L>
<L>Robes loo&s;ely flowing, hair as free,</L>
<L>Such &s;weet neglect more taketh me,</L>
<L>Than all th' adulteries of art&mdash;</L>
<L>They &s;trike mine eyes, but not my heart.</L></Q>
<P>THE company were &s;o delighted with the long and the performance, that we
<PB N="101" REF="103">
encored it three times. This little in|cident unravelled a my&s;tery which had hitherto puzzled us all. Mr. Eu&s;ton's long &s;tay at Albany, and his a&s;&s;iduous attendance at the Fort, created &s;ome|thing more than a &s;u&s;picion, that his heart had been &s;urpri&s;ed by the charms of one of the young ladies; but he was &s;o much upon his guard, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s which was the di&s;|tingui&s;hed fair one.</P>
<P>HE &s;ung the la&s;t &s;tanza with &s;o much feeling, &s;uch pointed expre&s;&s;ion in his eyes, and &s;uch particular application to Clara, that his preference of her was no longer a &s;ecret. The elegant &s;impli|city of her dre&s;s brought her exactly within the poet's de&s;cription; a white lute&s;tring robe, &s;o fitted to her &s;hape, as to di&s;gui&s;e nothing of its admirable &s;ymmetry; the graceful folds, not di&s;|torted by the Gothic invention of a hoop, &s;wept the ground, but with no
<PB N="102" REF="104">
enormous train, like that of a tragedy queen. A girdle of black velvet, bor|dered with &s;mall pearls, circled her &s;lender wai&s;t; her hair was loo&s;ely tied up behind with a knot of pale pink rib|bon, and &s;ome &s;trings of pearls, of the &s;ame &s;ize with tho&s;e bound round her girdle, confined its &s;hining ringlets from fall|ing too low over her forehead and temples.</P>
<P>THIS dre&s;s, in which nothing &s;eemed de&s;igned for ornament, but all for u&s;e, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t with that of Mi&s;s Bellenden's, where flowers, fea|thers, fringes, &s;treamers, flounces, trimmings, formed an a&s;&s;emblage of gay colours and figures, on which, as Young ob&s;erves,</P>
<Q>"The dazzled eyes could find no re&s;t."</Q>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">MISS Loui&s;a was dre&s;&s;ed with more propriety, but &s;he was fine; and her deportment, like her dre&s;s, &s;tately.</P>
<P>MR. Eu&s;ton's manner was too parti|cular to e&s;cape notice&mdash;Mi&s;s Bellenden reddened&mdash;Clara &s;eemed wholly uncon|cerned.</P>
<P><Q>WHAT an odious old-fa&s;hioned &s;ong,</Q> &s;aid the mortified beauty, <Q>was that the preaching gentleman gave us; and the mu&s;ic was as bad as the words.</Q> I defended both. &mdash;Clara was &s;ilent; but her eyes, which are great talkers, &s;poke &s;ufficiently plain.</P>
<P><Q>I DO not doubt but Clara thinks &s;he has made a conque&s;t,</Q> &s;aid Mi&s;s Bellenden, &s;pitefully; <Q>but I am &s;ure nobody will envy her.</Q></P>
<P>'Ah! why,' repeated Clara, look|ing earne&s;tly at her &s;i&s;ter,
<Q><L>"Will Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart;</L>
<L>"Nor claim the triumph of a letter'd heart?"</L></Q></P>
<P>'A LETTER'D heart!' exclaimed Mi&s;s Bellenden, laughing aloud. <Q>For
<PB N="104" REF="106">
Heaven's &s;ake! what is a letter'd heart? I prote&s;t I will a&s;k Mr. Eu&s;ton him&s;elf; he is &s;o wi&s;e, he knows every thing&mdash;he &s;hall tell me what a letter'd heart is.</Q></P>
<P>CLARA, anxious that her &s;i&s;ter &s;hould not expo&s;e her ignorance, yet not daring to contradict her, gave me a be&s;eeching look.</P>
<P>'No, no,' &s;aid I, holding her, <Q>he will laugh at us.</Q></P>
<P>'AH!' replied Mi&s;s Bellenden, <Q>I thought it was non&s;en&s;e. But pray, dear Clara, let us have no more of your rhimes; indeed they make you appear very &s;illy; and you know my mamma cannot endure your reading tho&s;e books &s;o much.</Q></P>
<P>IT is true, that Clara is fond of quot|ing her beloved poets; but &s;he does it &s;o aptly, her voice is &s;o harmonious,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
and her expre&s;&s;ion &s;o ju&s;t and beautiful, yet without the lea&s;t affectation, or even con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her powers of charming in this way, that every one, except her mother and &s;i&s;ter, are de|lighted, when &s;he either reads or re|peats.</P>
<P>MR. Eu&s;ton, though not a declared lover, has the marks &s;trongly on him. &mdash;He &s;carce ever lo&s;es &s;ight of his young charmer. &mdash;The ladies are &s;ure to meet him wherever they go; this hap|pens by chance, to be &s;ure, as he would have it appear. &mdash;And chance was very favourable to us on an occa&s;ion, which I am going to acquaint you with. For, &s;ince I mu&s;t always be writing to you, and the &s;imple tenor of my life affords no great and &s;triking events to intere&s;t your curio&s;ity, you mu&s;t give me leave to entertain you, by &s;electing from tho&s;e little occurrences, which every day pro|duces, &s;uch as are more worthy your attention.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">You mu&s;t know, then, that among the many contrivances we form, to vary our amu&s;ements in this place, Clara, who is a little romantic, propo&s;ed one, which met with general approbation: &mdash; This was, to make an excur&s;ion into the woods, which we beheld &s;o beauti|ful in pro&s;pect, from the ramparts of the Fort, and to pa&s;s an afternoon amid&s;t their &s;hades.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden not oppo&s;ing our &s;cheme, we &s;et out early after dinner; the young ladies, Mrs. Ben&s;on, and my&s;elf, attended by Mi&s;s Bellenden's maid, and two men-&s;ervants, who car|ried a large ba&s;ket, filled with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for tea. Clara &s;oon found out a proper place. &mdash;It was a lit|tle valley, &s;urrounded with lo&s;ty trees. The &s;ervants filled the tea-kettle at a &s;pring of delicate water, with which the&s;e woods abound; and lighted a fire at a convenient di&s;tance, while we &s;eated
<PB N="107" REF="109">
our&s;elves, as well as we could, and be|gan our different employments.</P>
<P>MISS Bellenden produced her net|ting, Loui&s;a her flower-piece, Mrs. Ben&s;on and I our plain-work, and Clara her book. This was a novel, newly publi&s;hed in your world; and becau&s;e it has uncommon merit, I &s;uppo&s;e you have read it. Mr. Eu&s;ton pre&s;ented it to Clara; and told us, that Cecilia is the performance of a young lady, who&s;e elegant genius is generally admired.</P>
<P>MANY of the incidents in this very &s;en&s;ible novel are extremely affecting, and made me weep like a child. I am not a&s;hamed to own, that I have been much moved by &s;uch agreeable fictions; and that it was not for real evils 1 &s;hed tears, but the ingenious fancies of an|other per&s;on, that excited the&s;e &s;trong emotions. This has been called a ty|rannical power, which the &s;en&s;es u&s;urp over rea&s;on; and proves, that the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
neighbourhood of the imagination is extremely contagious to the intellectual part.</P>
<P>CLARA was permitted by Mi&s;s Bel|lenden to read to us, while our tea was preparing.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of this plea&s;ing entertain|ment, we were alarmed with a hideous noi&s;e, which, to our terrified imagina|tion &s;eemed like the howling of wild bea&s;ts. Mi&s;s Bellenden &s;creamed aloud, her &s;i&s;ters echoed her cries, and clung round Mrs. Ben&s;on and me, hiding their faces in our bo&s;oms. We were half dead with fear our&s;elves, yet en|deavoured to comfort the young ladies.</P>
<P>'THESE are Indians, Madam,' &s;aid one of the men-&s;ervants to me; <Q>and by their &s;houting I imagine they are drunk. They will be upon us, pre|&s;ently, I &s;uppo&s;e. For Heaven's &s;ake! do not di&s;cover any &s;igns of fear; you will enrage them if you do.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">I HAD been told this before; and therefore earne&s;tly recommended it to our young friends, to appear as com|po&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THEY had ju&s;t rai&s;ed their heads, and dried their eyes, when three &s;avages bolted out of the wood, and pre&s;ented their hideous figures to our eyes. As &s;oon as they perceived us, they &s;et up a frightful yell, and &s;tood &s;till, gaz|ing on us with fixed attention.</P>
<P>LOUISA and Clara, not with standing all their efforts to appear calm, even &s;obbed with the violence of their emo|tions. Mi&s;s Bellenden, though pale and trembling, adju&s;ted her hair, and drew her&s;elf up, with an air that &s;hewed her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her charms. Such is the force of habit, that even in this moment of terror, her thoughts were not wholly diverted from their u&s;ual cour&s;e, and the de&s;ire of charming was always uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">THE two men-&s;ervants took no notice of the &s;avage intruders, but appeared to be very bu&s;y about the tea; and Mrs. Ben&s;on, very complai&s;antly, pre&s;ented them with &s;ome cakes, which they ac|cepted with a kind of &s;urly &s;atisfaction. She then offered them &s;ome tea; they ta&s;ted it, and returned the cups, &s;haking their heads; and made &s;igns which we did not under&s;tand; but one of the foot|men told us they wanted rum.</P>
<P>I BID him make them comprehend, that we had not any; at which they looked di&s;plea&s;ed, and talked to each other. It appeared to us, that they &s;uppo&s;ed we had &s;ome of this darling liquor, and would not part with any to them; and this thought encrea&s;ed our apprehen&s;ions; be&s;ides, we heard one of our &s;ervants &s;ay, in a whi&s;per to his companion, <Q>They are deadly drunk, I am afraid they will be mi&s;chie|vous.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">WE knew not what to do&mdash;to &s;tay was dreadful&mdash;and if we offered to go, it was probable they would hinder us. However, Mrs. Ben&s;on, in order to &s;ound their intentions, bid the &s;ervants put up the tea equipage in the ba&s;|ket.</P>
<P>THE Indians looked angry at this mo|tion; and one of them, moving from the place where they had both, till now, &s;tood like &s;tatues, kicked the ba&s;|ket with his foot, and threw it down, &s;eeming mightily plea&s;ed with the cra&s;h of the china.</P>
<P>THE young ladies, no longer able to re&s;train their fears, &s;creamed aloud. The Indians looked at them with a fierce and menacing air, and moved towards us&mdash;We gave our&s;elves over for lo&s;t.&mdash; When, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, Mr. Eu&s;ton appeared, brought thither by Mi&s;s Bellenden's maid, whom we had
<PB N="112" REF="114">
not mi&s;&s;ed; and who, upon the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the Indians, left us; and ran towards the Fort, in order to pro|cure &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>MR. Eu&s;ton, whom the &s;creams he had heard very much alarmed, ap|proached us with great anxiety in his looks. He addre&s;&s;ed his enquiries in general, but his eyes were almo&s;t always turned upon Clara. Finding, by our an&s;wers, that the &s;avages had behaved peaceably enough, he entered into &s;ome conver&s;ation with them, in their own language; after which he informed us that the&s;e Indians were &s;tragglers from a large party of their friends, a tribe of the Iroquois Indians, who had come down the river to celebrate one of their fe&s;tivals, in the neighbourhood of Al|bany. He told us, we had nothing to fear, tho&s;e nations being our good al|lies; that when they were intoxicated with liquor, they were apt to be trouble|&s;ome;
<PB N="113" REF="115">
but if they had known who we were, they would have behaved with more civility.</P>
<P>WE &s;oon found, by their altered looks and manners, that Mr. Eu&s;ton had given them &s;ome information con|cerning us. They gathered up the fragments of the china they had broke, and gazed on them with wi&s;hing eyes; but did not offer to take any, till Mrs. Ben&s;on made &s;igns to them, that they might have them; this pre&s;ent &s;eemed very acceptable; and finding that we were preparing to go, they marched before us, officiou&s;ly clearing our path from the underwood and broken boughs that ob&s;tructed our walk. They accom|panied us to the gates of the Fort, and then took leave of us, with many tokens of reverence and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WE had now &s;o effectually overcome our fears, that when Mr. Eu&s;ton pro|po&s;ed our going the next day to vi&s;it
<PB N="114" REF="116">
the Indians little camp, we eagerly ac|cepted it. The Colonel, however, cho&s;e to be of the party; this drew in Mrs. Bellenden, and Mr. Neville, and all the officers that were not upon duty, attended us; which, with &s;ome &s;er|vants, made up a large train.</P>
<P>THE Indians were a&s;&s;embled in a little plain; a great number of huts might be &s;een among the trees. The&s;e huts con&s;i&s;ted of three poles, covered on the top with the bark of trees, and lined with their branches, to keep out the &s;un. The women and children &s;at at the entrance of the huts. &mdash; Their hu&s;|bands and fathers lay indolently along within, &s;moaking or drinking.</P>
<P>THE young men were differently em|ployed; &s;ome in dancing, others in &s;hooting at a mark with their arrows, and not a few bu&s;y in preparing the fea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">SEVERAL large kettles, full of veni|&s;on, were &s;u&s;pended by a rope, fa&s;tened to two trees at a convenient di&s;tance, between which a large fire was kindled. As &s;oon as our company appeared, they in&s;tantly quitted their &s;ports and em|ployments, and crouding together, formed a circle, and continued gazing on us in a profound &s;ilence.</P>
<P>MR. Eu&s;ton approached them, and pointing to Colonel Bellenden, told them who he was. The Indians, con|&s;idering this vi&s;it from the great chief, as they called him, as a high honour, prepared, in token of re&s;pect, to enter|tain him with a dance. They kindled a large fire in the mid&s;t of the plain, threw their mantles over their &s;houlders, each holding up a large knife in one hand, they danced round the fire in a ring, their feet keeping time to a &s;low and barbarous &s;train, and their eyes fixed on the ground. This ceremony, which we thought very frightful, but
<PB N="116" REF="118">
with which we affected to appear ex|tremely plea&s;ed, la&s;ted half an hour.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Indians had fini&s;hed their dance, they re&s;umed their former &s;ports, and we mixed among the wo|men, &s;ome of whom were tolerably hand&s;ome. We took notice of the children; and were delighted to hear the women &s;peak, though we could not under&s;tand them, the tone of their voices was &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;weet and har|monious.</P>
<P>WHILE we were ranging from hut to hut, Mi&s;s Bellenden ob&s;erved two young Indians at a di&s;tance, leaning again&s;t a tree with a di&s;contented air. &mdash; Their figures were plea&s;ing, and their dre&s;s mighty &s;mart; their heads were adorned with feathers; their ears loaded with &s;trings of wampum, and their mantles trimmed with &s;everal rows of tin&s;el lace. The&s;e young men had neither joined the dance, nor mixed in any of
<PB N="117" REF="119">
the &s;ports. Curious to know the cau&s;e of their exclu&s;ion, we went up to them; and Mr. Eu&s;ton a&s;ked them, Why they continued apart from the re&s;t?</P>
<P>WITHOUT changing their po&s;ture, and &s;carce rai&s;ing their eyes to look on us, they told him, that not being of the party, they had no right to eat, and therefore had no inclination to dance.</P>
<P>WE now &s;earched our pockets for &s;ome trifles, to pre&s;ent to the&s;e poor ne|glected young &s;avages. One of us pro|duced a &s;mall pen-knife, another a lit|tle &s;nuff-box, Mi&s;s Bellenden made an offering of her pocket-gla&s;s, and Loui&s;a gave a knot of ribbons; Clara blu&s;hed, becau&s;e &s;he could find nothing in her pocket but her Pa&s;tor Fido, which, as &s;he was now &s;tudying Italian with great application, &s;he always carried about her; not willing, however, to appear le&s;s liberal than the re&s;t of the com|pany,
<PB N="118" REF="120">
&s;he pre&s;ented her cambric pocket handkerchief with a ba&s;hful air, which the Indian who received it immediately tore in two, tying a piece round each arm. We le&s;t them extremely de|lighted with our civility, and returned to the Fort. Adieu, my dear Maria, I mu&s;t clo&s;e my letter here &mdash; A &s;loop is this in&s;tant going off for New-York, and will take my packet.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. MRS. BENSON TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT &s;hall never be laid to my charge that you &s;peak of me favourably, and that I hear of it without gratitude; a good opinion lays one under an obli|gation from whom&s;oever it comes; but when judgment like yours com|mends, not to be vain would be to be above human frailty. He who &s;aid Socrates was prouder of one word &s;poke by the oracle in his favour, than of all the prai&s;es the worlds be&s;towed upon him, &s;peaks my &s;entiments. In return for your making me vain, Ma|dam,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
which, the cau&s;e con&s;idered, I can &s;carce allow to be a fault, I will make you happy by informing you, that your valued and amiable friend is a mother, and has given us a lovely boy, who is called after a young gentleman, whom we hope has been for &s;ome time the happie&s;t man in the world.</P>
<P>I WRITE this by Mrs. Neville's bed|&s;ide, who is, with &s;ome little alteration of the old phra&s;e on this occa&s;ion, bet|ter than could be expected.</P>
<P>To explain this I mu&s;t tell you, that when the affair was all over, the lady in bed, and in a &s;weet &s;leep, I retired to take &s;ome re&s;t, having been up the whole night; but was &s;oon waked by a loud and confu&s;ed noi&s;e of many tongues &s;peaking all at once. Among the&s;e I di&s;tingui&s;hed Mr. Neville's, who by the oaths he threw out in quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, I under&s;tood to be in a violent rage.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">ALARMED and confounded at a cla|mour &s;o prepo&s;terous at &s;uch a time, I flew down &s;tairs: at the entrance of Mrs. Neville's chamber I met Mr. Ne|ville, who &s;eizing my arm with a dreadful gripe, exclaimed&mdash; <Q>Oh! Ma|dam, come in, &s;ee what the&s;e Dutch devils have done, &mdash;they have killed my wife!</Q></P>
<P>I ENTERED the room, trembling, and &s;aw one part of it newly &s;coured, and &s;treams of water running over the other, which i&s;&s;ued from a large pail that had been overturned.</P>
<P>While Mr. Neville continued cur&s;|ing and raving at the nur&s;e, who, being entitled by her age and her wealth to wear a forehead cloth, a di&s;tinction which the matrons here are extremely fond of, con&s;idered her&s;elf as highly af|fronted by his behaviour. I enquired of Fanny, who &s;tood by in great agi|tation,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the meaning of the &s;trange ap|pearances I beheld.</P>
<P>SHE told me the nur&s;e, as &s;oon as I was retired, had called up the hou&s;e|maid, and ordered the room to be &s;coured. <Q>I remon&s;trated again&s;t it in vain,</Q> pur&s;ued Fanny, weeping, <Q>and &s;aid it would kill my lady&mdash;that it was not the cu&s;tom in our country. But finding that I could not prevail, I called my ma&s;ter, who was &s;o &s;hocked at their having wetted the room, which he &s;aid would kill his wife with cold, that he kicked down the pail in a rage, and &s;et it all afloat as you &s;ee.</Q></P>
<P>I ORDERED a large fire to be made in the room; and, collecting all the carpets in the hou&s;e, laid them one upon another on the floor. Mrs. Ne|ville was anxious only for her child. I oppo&s;ed very bad arguments to her rea|&s;onable fears, but it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="123" REF="125">
to quiet her mind; as for Mr. Neville, he continued to rail and &s;wear.</P>
<P><Q>DID you ever hear of &s;uch a &s;avage cu&s;tom?</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>what! &s;cour the chamber of a lying-in woman!</Q></P>
<P>'THE greate&s;t mi&s;chief,' I replied, <Q>is likely to happen from the pail of water that was thrown down.</Q></P>
<P>'AYE,' &s;aid he, <Q>that was unfortu|nate, to be &s;ure; but it was very na|tural for me to be in, a pa&s;&s;ion you know, when my wife's life was endan|gered by that old Dutch woman's ab|&s;urdity.</Q></P>
<P>To per&s;uade Mr. Neville that he can ever be wrong is a talk no human un|der&s;tanding is equal to. I &s;uffered him therefore to march off in triumph, at having &s;ilenced me with &s;o complete a defence, and took care to prevent any
<PB N="124" REF="126">
future blunders of the nur&s;e, who only followed the cu&s;tom of her country, to which we were &s;trangers, and therefore could not guard again&s;t.</P>
<P>MRS. Neville and the child are per|fectly well. She makes an admirable nur&s;e, and lo&s;es none of her delicacy by doing the duty of a mother. This little &s;tranger has been received with great joy by the father, who having now an heir to his uncle's e&s;tate, is not appre|hen&s;ive of its going out of his line.</P>
<P>MRS. Neville has given you an ac|count, Madam, of our adventure in the woods with the two drunken &s;avages; her &s;ituation made me tremble for the con&s;equences of the fright &s;he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have been in, which, however, &s;he concealed &s;o well, as to make me tolerably ea&s;y; but our little boy bears under his left brea&s;t the di&s;tinct mark of a bow and arrow, the arms born by one
<PB N="125" REF="127">
of the&s;e &s;avages. This power of the imagination has been denied with &s;uch force of argument by &s;ome learned writers, that nothing but the evidence of my own eyes could force my a&s;&s;ent to the po&s;&s;ibility of it.</P>
<P>A TROUBLESOME affair has fallen out within the&s;e few days, which I have been fortunate enough to conceal from my friend, who&s;e keenne&s;s of ob&s;erva|tion it is difficult to elude.</P>
<P>MR. Neville and Lieutenant Blood had a di&s;pute about &s;ome trifle, which was managed with &s;uch heat on both &s;ides as to produce a quarrel; and a challenge en&s;ued on the part of Mr. Neville. The day, the hour, and the place of meeting were all &s;ettled, but happily the colonel was informed of the de&s;ign time enough to prevent it, and put them both under an arre&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">THE only difficulty now was to recon|cile them, that nothing of the kind might be apprehended for the future. The colonel undertook Mr. Blood, who on &s;uch occa&s;ions, being endowed with that docility with which the valiant re|proach the wife, was prevailed upon by his commander's arguments, enforced by his authority, to lay a&s;ide his wrath. I had more trouble with Mr. Neville, who is pa&s;&s;ionate and ob&s;tinate, but I carried my point at la&s;t, by rea&s;ons partly &s;erious, partly je&s;ting.</P>
<P>'IF Heaven,' &s;aid I, <Q>had given you three or four lives, you might at any time venture one, and &s;ometimes, in a fit of valour, let one go, knowing you have another in &s;tore; but to be pro|digal in poverty, and to be carele&s;s of the only head you have, when no art can make you a new one, is unrea&s;on|able to the la&s;t degree.</Q> Mr. Neville at length agreed to let the Colonel &s;et|tle
<PB N="127" REF="129">
the difference; and all was made up over a bottle of wine at the Fort.</P>
<P>I HAVE now, Madam, acquainted you with every thing that has pa&s;&s;ed here worthy your notice; and have nothing to add, but that I am with the greate&s;t e&s;teem and re&s;pect, your obedient &s;er|vant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX. MRS. NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I REMEMBER I once told you, my dear Maria, that I was re&s;olved to turn philo&s;opher, and &s;o be revenged on Fortune for all her cruelties to me. I am now called to a new trial, which yet is not &s;o &s;evere as &s;ome I have al|ready &s;u&s;tained; but you, who on all occa&s;ions feel for me, perhaps, more than I do for my&s;elf, will think it &s;uffi|ciently mortifying.</P>
<P>I HAD ju&s;t began to ta&s;te &s;omething like happine&s;s. &mdash;My dear little boy re|pays my care, with every advantage a fond mother can de&s;ire, &mdash; health, beauty, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and early rea&s;on;
<PB N="129" REF="131">
a wi&s;e and faithful friend at home; &s;ome agreeable companions abroad; and a growing ta&s;te for the climate, and the wild yet not unplea&s;ing &s;cenes around me.</P>
<P>HOW truly has it been &s;aid, that the limits of our joy is but the ab&s;ence of &s;ome degree of &s;orrow. Within the&s;e few days Mr. Neville has informed me, that he has obtained a promi&s;e of Colonel Bellenden, to be appointed to the com|mand of a fort in Schonectady.</P>
<P>THIS is a little town, di&s;tant about thirty miles from Albany, inhabited only by &s;ome Dutch traders. Seldom vi&s;ited by any &s;trangers, but Indians, who &s;traggle hither, not only from the five nations of the Iroquois, our allies, but the &s;avages of Canada, and other barbarous nations.</P>
<P>WHETHER impelled by that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of temper, which makes every change,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
even for the wor&s;e, de&s;ireable; or the &s;trange pride, of being greate&s;t where all is little, I know not, but Mr. Ne|ville is fixed in his re&s;olution; and when he acquainted me with the approaching change in my &s;ituation, it was not to hear my opinion, to a&s;k my advice, or to &s;ooth me into a con&s;ent, but barely to &s;ignify his will to me; to which I offered no oppo&s;ition, well knowing that it would produce no other effect, but ill humour, and unju&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. Neville left me, after this unwelcome communication, Mrs. Ben|&s;on, alarmed at the fullenne&s;s of his a&s;|pect as he pa&s;&s;ed by her, came eagerly to my chamber, to enquire the cau&s;e of his apparent di&s;&s;atisfaction; when I told her what had pa&s;&s;ed, the pau&s;ed for a few moments, ca&s;ting on me now and then a &s;oft and &s;ympathi&s;ing look &mdash; then recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he took my hand, which &s;he tenderly pre&s;t&mdash;</P>

<P><Q>DOUBT not but I will follow you to this &s;avage &s;olitude; and we &s;hall be able to &s;trike out amu&s;ements, which, as they will depend entirely upon our|&s;elves, will always be within our reach. &mdash;We have books, we have mu&s;ic, and ideas I hope, to furni&s;h out an agreeable and profitable conver&s;ation. Your little boy will &s;oon be of an age to exerci&s;e you in higher cares than tho&s;e of a tender and diligent nur&s;e.

<P>IT was thus that this worthy woman rea&s;oned with me, &s;oothed me, and re|conciled my will to a di&s;pen&s;ation, which my heart murmured at before; &s;o that when Mrs. Bellenden came to condole with me, upon a &s;eparation &s;o un|expected, and offered, if I would con&s;ent to it, to manage matters &s;o with the Colonel as to prevent this wild &s;cheme, (as &s;he called it,) of my hu&s;band's, taking place, I earne&s;tly intreated her to form no ob&s;tacle to his de&s;igns, declaring my voluntary acquie&s;cence to them.</P>
<P>THIS lady is too good a wife to di&s;|approve of my conduct on this occa&s;ion. She promi&s;ed me to make my bani&s;h|ment as tolerable as po&s;&s;ible, by a fre|quent intercour&s;e of vi&s;its. I &s;miled, and pointing to the now dreary pro&s;pect around us, for winter, which in this
<PB N="134" REF="136">
country &s;ets in with a &s;udden tran&s;ition from extreme heat to inten&s;e cold, had already covered the ground with &s;now, at lea&s;t three feet deep. &mdash;One pure ex|pance of white meets the dazzled eye, as far as its &s;ight can reach; the branches of the trees, loaded with &s;now, look like enormous plumes of feathers &s;pangled with gems, formed by the fro&s;t. That beautiful river, where we u&s;ed to &s;ee innumerable elegant little hoops, failing to and from New-York, is now become an icy plain, and bears on its frozen bo&s;om deep loaded car|riages, called &s;ledges, drawn by hor&s;es, which &s;eem to fly over the gla&s;&s;y &s;ur|face.</P>
<P>'SEE, Madam,' &s;aid I, <Q>what a &s;tern appearance Nature has put on; can friend&s;hip find a way through tho&s;e pathle&s;s woods, to vi&s;it the poor exile at Schonectady?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137"><Q>NEVER doubt it, my dear Mrs. Ne|ville,</Q> replied the good lady, <Q>tho&s;e pathle&s;s woods &s;hall yet afford us a pa&s;&s;age to you, when we need it, but happily that will not be till &s;pring; for Lieutenant G&mdash; is not to be relieved till then.</Q> This was plea&s;ing news to all, but Mr. Neville, who is impatient to enter upon his new com|mand.</P>
<P>ALAS! my dear Maria, you can have no conception of the rigor of a North American winter. We have had a fall of &s;now, which continued three days, which now lies upon the ground, to the depth of five feet, and is frozen &s;o hard that it feels like the &s;olid earth. We are, it &s;eems, to expect no abatement of this extreme rigor the&s;e five months; but the con&s;tant &s;erenity of a cloudle&s;s &s;ky, and the enlivening rays of the &s;un, increa&s;e that cheerfulne&s;s which we owe to our now well-braced nerves: but it is cold, inten&s;ely cold; I can &s;carce

keep my&s;elf tolerably warm, though I &s;it by a fire, where half the fore&s;t is blazing.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on looks over my &s;houlder as I am writing, and tells me, laughing, that metaphor is carried very high&mdash;But &s;eriou&s;ly, although my &s;tandi&s;h is placed upon the &s;teel hearth, it is with diffi|culty the ink is kept from freezing, and &s;lakes of black ice frequently fall out of my pen upon the paper. &mdash; This will ac|count for &s;ome of the many blots you meet with.</P>
<P>I WAS interrupted by a vi&s;it from Mr. Eu&s;ton. He is much altered&mdash;Clara's attractions have proved too powerful for his philo&s;ophy. He rea&s;ons le&s;s, though he talks more than he u&s;ed to do; but all his di&s;cour&s;e bears &s;ome analogy to the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of his heart; and, whatever be the &s;ubject, it leads him in&s;en&s;ibly to the object that fills his thoughts. Hitherto he has declared
<PB N="137" REF="139">
him&s;elf no otherwi&s;e, than by a&s;&s;idui|ties, and the &s;ilent rhetoric of looks and &s;ighs. But he has a rival, whom he mu&s;t either &s;upplant, or yield to; and this circum&s;tance will decide the mat|ter.</P>
<P>WITH this rival I would fain make you acquainted; if I knew how to de&s;|cribe a creature, to whom no di&s;tinction can belong for more than ten minutes together. He is every thing and no|thing. &mdash;Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;ays, he is more fool than wi&s;e, and more a wag than fool. At the very moment, when he has been talking &s;o much to the pur|po&s;e that you would. pronounce him a &s;en&s;ible young fellow, he throws out &s;omething &s;o wretchedly &s;illy, as to de|&s;erve the appellation of a fool. One while the &s;tupid &s;olemnity of his coun|tenance excites a laugh, at another, the archne&s;s of his look and &s;atirical &s;miles, make one afraid of him.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">HE is &s;on to the late Governor, and nephew to the Earl of H &mdash;, by who&s;e intere&s;t he was appointed, third lieutenant to Colonel Bellenden; and came from England to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new po&s;t. He has a fine face, and a figure remarkably elegant; his man|ners are often polite, and often clowni&s;h; his addre&s;s &s;ometimes courtly, and &s;ome|times aukward; in a word, he is a per|fect contradiction. But you will be better able to form an idea of him, from a few traits, which my memory furni&s;hes me with for your informa|tion.</P>
<P>A FEW days after his arrival, being at the Fort, where a large company was a&s;&s;embled, and where the beauty of his per&s;on, the elegance of his dre&s;s, and the politenes of his behaviour, engaged every ones attention, Mi&s;s Bellenden happened to drop her glove; he took it up, and pre&s;ented it to her with a grace that was infinitely plea&s;ing, entreating
<PB N="139" REF="141">
her at the &s;ame time to permit him the honour of drawing it on; &s;he &s;miled and held out her arm, on which, white as it is, a few freckles appeared.</P>
<P>Mr. C&mdash; looked earne&s;tly on it for a minute, then exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>HEAVENS! why you are &s;potted like a toad.</Q> She blu&s;hed, and frowned. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who were near enough to hear what he &s;aid, expre&s;&s;ed in their looks the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>CLARA, who &s;at next him, laughed; upon which Mr. C&mdash;, finding Mi&s;s Bellenden &s;at &s;ullen and &s;ilent, and would not even look at him, turned to her &s;i&s;ter, and with the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t gallant air imaginable, entered into a conver&s;ation with her full of &s;prightline&s;s, and of turns, which, if they could not be called witty, were at lea&s;t very like wit. Clara took occa&s;ion to rally him upon the coar&s;e &s;peech he had made to
<PB N="140" REF="142">
her &s;i&s;ter, but he defended him&s;elf with &s;uch an arch &s;implicity, as quite con|founded her.</P>
<P>COLONEL Bellenden knows not how to treat him; re&s;pectable on account of his birth and connexions, he has a cer|tain air of grandeur diffu&s;ed over his whole per&s;on, that keeps contempt at a di&s;tance, in &s;pite of all his ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>ON the day that he was to be pre|&s;ented to the troops, who were drawn up upon the parade, headed by their officers, with colours flying, drums beating, and all the <HI>pomp and circum|&s;tance</HI> of military ceremonial, he ap|peared, in&s;tead of regimentals, in white and &s;ilver, and a plume of feathers in his hat without a cockade. The Colonel perceived him before he came to the gates, and ha&s;tily ran to prevent his entering, and expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the deri&s;ion of the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143"><Q>WHAT is the meaning or your ap|pearing in this dre&s;s, Sir,</Q> &s;aid he, with an indignant frown; <Q>Do you not know what is to be done to-day?</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE are to have a ball, Sir; are we not?</Q> replied Mr.C&mdash;, with an air highly re&s;pectful, but not in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted. The Colonel was ab&s;o|lutely taken in by the &s;teady compo&s;ure of his looks, and the &s;eeming &s;implicity of his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>'WHAT &s;trange mi&s;apprehen&s;ion,' &s;aid he, <Q>is this! Go, Sir, put on your regimentals, and appear in your pro|per character.</Q> He then de&s;ired Mr. Neville to accompany him, and inform him what was to be done.</P>
<P>Mr. C&mdash; retired, making a low obei&s;ance; and in a &s;hort time after|wards returned, dre&s;&s;ed <HI>en militaire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">NOTHING could exceed the elegance and dignity of his figure in this dre&s;s&mdash; there was &s;omething &s;o noble in his air, &s;o intere&s;ting in his countenance, that every eye beheld him with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE deep re&s;pect with which he re|ceived his pike from the colonel was accompanied with equal dignity; and the grace that appeared in his motions and attitude, when he took his po&s;t, drew a kind look of approbation from his benevolent commander. But what was his confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment when this young man, forgetting his duty and his &s;tation, faint with heat, and fatigued as it &s;hould &s;eem with holding his pike, gave it into the hand of a &s;erjeant, who &s;tood neare&s;t him, and quitting his rank, ran towards the ladies, &s;natched a fan out of Mi&s;s Bel|lenden's hand, and began to fan him|&s;elf with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, amid&s;t the general a&s;toni&s;hment his extravagant action occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">AT fir&s;t all eyes were fixed on him with &s;ilent wonder; then an ill &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed laugh ran through the ranks; the officers caught the contagion, but quickly recovered them&s;elves, attentive to the motions of the colonel, who for a moment &s;tood gazing on the &s;trange youth with a &s;evere and &s;teady eye; then advancing towards him&mdash;</P>
<P>'Boy,' whi&s;pered he to him, <Q>a fool's cap and bells would better become you than this re&s;pectable dre&s;s and manly profe&s;&s;ion.</Q> Then calling Mr. Neville, he &s;poke to him in a low voice; and turning again to Mr. C&mdash;, who by this time had given Mi&s;s Bellenden her fan with his u&s;ual graceful manner&mdash;</P>
<P>'Go, Sir,' &s;aid he, <Q>follow this of|ficer, and learn how ill the behaviour of a buffoon &s;its upon a gentleman and a &s;oldier.</Q></P>
<P>Mr.C&mdash; either was, or affected an ex|treme &s;urpri&s;e in his looks at this repri|mand
<PB N="144" REF="146">
but, &s;ilent and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, he bowed profoundly low to the colonel, then to the ladies, and went off the pa|rade with Mr. Neville.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, concluding thus ridiculou&s;ly, afforded us &s;ufficient matter for di&s;cour&s;e. Mr. Neville placed a centinel at the door of Mr. C.'s lodgings, and informed him he was put under an arre&s;t. After &s;ome ridiculous enquiries concerning the nature of his offence, and the duration of his confine|ment, he &s;ent his re&s;pectful compliments to the commandant; and ordering his &s;ervant to bring his flute, Mr. Neville left him entertaining him&s;elf very agree|ably.</P>
<P>COLONEL Bellenden &s;ent for him the next day, and they had a private confe|rence, that la&s;ted near two hours. I &s;up|po&s;e he &s;oftened the colonel by his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; for he appeared to be received
<PB N="145" REF="147">
into &s;ome degree of favour. The &s;ol|diers, to a man, are loud in his prai&s;e, for he ordered a noble large&s;s to be di&s;tributed among them; and they can &s;ee no faults in an officer who is &s;o liberal.</P>
<P>HE met with &s;ome mortifications, however, in Mrs. Bellenden's circle that evening. She looked grave upon him; Mi&s;s Bellenden treated him with con|tempt &mdash; Loui&s;a &s;hunned him &mdash; Clara, moved by the natural &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, took pity on him, and &s;uf|fered him to engro&s;s her conver&s;ation the whole night. This kindne&s;s com|pleted the conque&s;t of his heart; he is become &s;eriou&s;ly in love with her, and much le&s;s extravagant in his behaviour than u&s;ual. I can perceive that Mr. Eu&s;ton is unea&s;y, notwith&s;tanding his endeavours to conceal it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148">'OUR new Cymon,' &s;aid he to me one day with a forced laugh, <Q>improves daily.</Q> &mdash; 'Not &s;o much,' replied I, <Q>as to give him hopes of obtaining his Iphigenia.</Q></P>
<P>'WHY not,' &s;aid he, <Q>the miracle would not be new, though he were to become a wi&s;e man. Love, which has &s;ometimes made a philo&s;opher a fool, may make a fool a philo&s;opher.</Q></P>
<P>THE people of this country have be|gun their winter amu&s;ements. Nothing is to be &s;een on the river but &s;ledges full of happy parties:&mdash;the&s;e are the only carriages in u&s;e in this &s;evere &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THERE is an odd cu&s;tom among the younger and meaner &s;ort, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile with good order and decency.</P>
<P>A COMPANY of a dozen young Dutch|men, and as many girls, agree to go
<PB N="147" REF="149">
out upon a <HI>froolick</HI> as they call it. The&s;e are di&s;tributed into &s;ix &s;ledges, two couples in a &s;ledge: as they go at a pro|digious rate, they &s;ometimes travel forty and fifty miles in a day, to the differ|ent farm-hou&s;es they propo&s;e to vi&s;it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they appear, all hands are &s;et to work, to provide an entertain|ment for them; and great is the &s;laughter among the poultry and pigs to furni&s;h out the fea&s;t. They &s;it long at table, and conclude the evening with dancing, for they always carry a fidler along with them.</P>
<P>WHEN they are di&s;po&s;ed to go to re&s;t, the large&s;t room in the hou&s;e is pre|pared for their reception. They &s;pread before an enormous fire a quantity of mats and carpets, over which they lay feather beds and coverlets. The company lie down in their clothes, and &s;leep as well as they can, till morning,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
when a plentiful breakfa&s;t of tea, cream, hot cakes, and hung beef, is provided for them; after which they drive away to their next &s;tage, which is generally at a great di&s;tance, where they meet with the &s;ame welcome and, equal hos|pitality.</P>
<P>IN this manner they traver&s;e the country, &s;pending &s;ometimes a week, &s;ometimes a fortnight, in the&s;e excur|&s;ions; the farmers, wherever they, chu&s;e to &s;top, being, by an ancient cu&s;tom, obliged to receive them, and treat them well.</P>
<P>I WENT out ye&s;terday for the fir&s;t time in our new winter carriage. Mrs. Ben&s;on, Mi&s;s Clara, and Mr. Eu&s;ton, made up my party, for Mr. Neville was upon guard. We were well wrapped up in furrs, and our feet defended from the piercing cold by &s;everal bear-&s;kins, that were laid at the bottom of the &s;ledge.
<PB N="149" REF="151">
Happy was it for us that Mr. Eu&s;ton was with us, for an accident happened that might have had the mo&s;t danger|ous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>OUR road lay through the woods: as we flew along, (for &s;o the motion of the&s;e vehicles over the frozen &s;now may be called) &s;uddenly I perceived the two fore paws of an animal upon the lower part of the &s;ledge, on that &s;ide where I &s;at. The driver that in&s;tant la&s;hing his hor&s;es, the creature by this increa&s;ed velocity lo&s;t his hold: Mr. Eu&s;ton, at the &s;ame moment, &s;eized a loaded hor&s;e-pi&s;tol, which was carried by the &s;ervant who &s;at behind the carriage, and jumped out. We then perceived our danger. The furious bear, for a bear it was, had followed the &s;ledge, and was come almo&s;t near enough to &s;pring upon us, when our gallant friend, oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to its a&s;&s;ault, levelled his piece,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
and took &s;o &s;ure an aim, as laid the fierce creature weltering in its blood at his feet.</P>
<P>THE explo&s;ion of the gun, repeated by a thou&s;and echoes, the hideous howl|ing of the dying animal, mixed with our &s;creams, filled the wild &s;olitude around us with &s;ounds more dreadful than imagination can conceive. We were by this time at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; for our driver did not &s;lacken his pace; and had not the &s;ledge been overturned, pa&s;&s;ing over the body of a large tree, that lay acro&s;s the road, which in his terror he did not ob&s;erve, we &s;hould have been out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>NONE of us received the lea&s;t hurt by this accident; for the overturning of a &s;ledge is &s;eldom attended with any dan|ger, being open on each &s;ide, and hav|ing no top.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153">MR. Eu&s;ton now came up to us, and anxiou&s;ly enquired if we were &s;afe. We congratulated him upon his victory; and with the mo&s;t heart-felt gratitude thanked him for our pre&s;ervation. Clara &s;aid little; but that little was accompa|nied with a look &s;o expre&s;&s;ive, as &s;eem|ed to have a powerful effect upon her lover's heart, for he gazed on her for a moment with extreme tenderne&s;s, and heard not one word that Mrs. Ben|&s;on and I &s;aid to him about his combat.</P>
<P>AT length he helped us into our car|riage; and, as he was &s;tepping into it him&s;elf, Clara gra&s;ped my hand eagerly and whi&s;pered&mdash;'Ah! Madam, he bleeds.'</P>
<P>'He does indeed,' &s;aid I, greatly alarmed, perceiving then, for the fir&s;t time, that one of his legs was covered with blood. &mdash; 'You are hurt, Sir,' &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154">'I HAVE got a &s;cratch,' replied he, &s;miling; <Q>the creature made an at|tack upon my leg, but my fire had the good fortune to take place before I received much damage.</Q></P>
<P>'YOU mu&s;t give us leave, however,' &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, <Q>to bind up your wound with what linen we can col|lect.</Q> We all contributed; Clara, who till then had looked pale as death, now blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively as &s;he offered her help. Mr. Eu&s;ton &s;uffered us to do as we plea&s;ed&mdash; his whole at|tention was fixed upon my amiable young friend. We ordered the driver to make what ha&s;te he could back to the Fort, where his wound was dre&s;&s;ed by the &s;urgeon of the garri&s;on, who ea&s;ed us of our fears by declaring that it was not in the lea&s;t dangerous.</P>
<P>THE colonel and his lady were full of acknowledgments to this gentleman
<PB N="153" REF="155">
for his gallant defence of us; and in|deed we had all rea&s;on to be grateful; for had he not by &s;pringing out of the &s;ledge expo&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ingly to the a&s;&s;ault of the ferocious animal, it is uncertain which of us might have been &s;eized upon.</P>
<P>SUCH accidents as this, however, are very rare &s;o near any of the &s;ettlements, and in the day too. But love, Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;ays, laughing, was determin|ed to favour &s;o re&s;pectable a votary, by affording him an opportunity of &s;hewing how well he de&s;erved the pre|ference which Clara, notwith&s;tanding all her ba&s;hfulne&s;s and re&s;erve, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to give him over his young rival. But this rival is countenanced by Mrs. Bellenden, who, &s;educed by the &s;plendour of his family, and the large fortune he is likely to inherit, is willing to overlook all his extravagan|cies. The colonel, I believe, if left to his own judgment, would favour Mr.
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Eu&s;ton, and prefer an ea&s;y indepen|dence for his daughter, with a man of his character, to the &s;uperior advantages of birth and fortune, clogged with the ab&s;urdities of Mr. C&mdash;.</P>
<P>I HEARD him &s;peak highly in his prai&s;e one day to Mrs. Bellenden, who does not &s;eem to reli&s;h his conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><Q>WHAT was formerly &s;aid of a great man,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>to whom I had the honour to be known, may be very well applied to Mr. Eu&s;ton. As nature has given him the good qua|lities that cannot be acquired by &s;tudy, &s;o his own &s;tudy hath procured him all the good qualities that are not the gifts of nature.</Q> &mdash; This was a fine eulogium, my dear Maria; and I took care the worthy man &s;hould not be ignorant of it.</P>

Already we behold a large town ri&s;ing in a plain, behind the fort, con&s;i&s;ting of hou&s;es made of branches of trees, interwoven with each other, and fa&s;tened to a number of &s;takes. The&s;e people &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the produce of hunting, fi&s;hing, and &s;ome &s;ponta|neous fruits. We &s;ometimes vi&s;it the women and children in their huts, and make them little pre&s;ents; but we never go but in large companies, and well at|tended;
<PB N="159" REF="161">

<P>MRS. Ben&s;on and I are in great, af|fliction &mdash;Mr. Eu&s;ton has left Albany, and will &s;oon leave the whole province, as he propo&s;es to return to England this &s;ummer. It is no difficult matter to perceive, that he has left his heart be|hind him; and although he pleaded pre&s;&s;ing affairs, which demanded his pre&s;ence at home, yet it is certain, that the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion for Clara, is the true cau&s;e of his &s;udden departure.</P>
<P>I LEARN, from my young friend, that he had, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner imaginable, &s;olicited Mrs. Bellenden to favour his &s;uit, and procure the Colo|nel's con&s;ent; giving &s;uch an account of his family, his fortune, and character, which, as they knew to be true, by the
<PB N="160" REF="162">
te&s;timony of the fir&s;t per&s;ons in the pro|vince, they could form no rea&s;onable objection to.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden, however, received his propo&s;als with great coldne&s;s, though with her u&s;ual politene&s;s; and being pre&s;&s;ed for a deci&s;ive an&s;wer, frankly owned, &s;he had other views for Mi&s;s Clara, and begged he would de&s;i&s;t from all future preten&s;ions to her. He bowed, was &s;ilent, and from that mo|ment avoided all occa&s;ions of entertain|ing the young lady particularly.</P>
<P>THE evening before he left Albany he &s;pent with me; and notwith&s;tanding an apparent depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, his conver&s;ation was &s;o agreeable and in|&s;tructive, as to fill me with the deepe&s;t regret for the lo&s;s of it.</P>
<P>I WAS at the fort the next morning, when he came to take leave of the fa|mily.
<PB N="161" REF="163">
Mi&s;s Bellenden, when &s;he &s;aw him enter the room, whi&s;pered me ex|ultingly&mdash;</P>
<P>'THANK Heaven! the Preacher, (&s;o &s;he always calls him) <Q>is going to leave us.</Q></P>
<P>THE Colonel pre&s;&s;ed his hand affec|tionately, and expre&s;&s;ed much concern at his leaving Albany; Mrs. Bellenden &s;aid the civili&s;t things in the world upon the occa&s;ion. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Bellenden and Loui&s;a, with an ea&s;y po|lite air; but his compliment to Clara was confu&s;ed, inarticulate, and accom|panied with evident emotion.</P>
<P>SHE curt&s;ied low, with an air of deep re&s;pect, without once rai&s;ing her eyes, or uttering a word. As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he withdrew, and was followed by a &s;arca&s;tic laugh from her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who is very angry that her triumphs are le&s;&s;ened, by the con|que&s;ts
<PB N="162" REF="164">
made by this little girl, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of plea&s;ing in a higher degree than any one I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>MR. C&mdash; is more pert than ever &s;ince the departure of Mr. Eu&s;ton, in who&s;e company he had &s;en&s;ibility enough to appear awed and aba&s;hed. Mrs. Bellenden is continually giving him le&s;|&s;ons of decorum, and he promi&s;es to practice them all, in hopes of plea&s;ing Mi&s;s Clara, who&s;e coldne&s;s and re&s;erve to him are increa&s;ed &s;ince the ab&s;ence of his rival. He has made a formal ap|plication to the Colonel for his con&s;ent to addre&s;s his younge&s;t daughter; and was told, that he mu&s;t fir&s;t procure the appro|bation of his friends. This he immedi|ately &s;et about, by writing to the Go|vernor, under who&s;e direction he is placed, intreating him to propo&s;e the affair to his mother, and the Earl of H&mdash;, his uncle.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">THE Governor has taken no other notice of his reque&s;t, than to &s;end or|ders for his leaving Albany immediately, and returning to New-York.</P>
<P>IN his Excellency's letter to the Co|lonel, upon this occa&s;ion, he hints at the rea&s;on of his &s;udden order. The Colo|nel an&s;wered with that noble frankne&s;s which marks his character; and gave him an account of the young man's ap|plication, and the an&s;wer he had thought proper to give him; treating the mat|ter, however, in &s;o carele&s;s a manner, as gave him to under&s;tand, that he had &s;carce con&s;idered it as meriting any &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden charges the Gover|nor with unpolitene&s;s on this occa&s;ion, and want of due re&s;pect to her hu&s;band; who&s;e birth, &s;he hints, is equal if not &s;uperior to that of the Governor; al|though he holds but the &s;econd rank in the province.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">IT is certain, that the immediate or|der he &s;ent for the young man's leaving Albany, &s;eemed &s;ugge&s;ted by a very unnece&s;&s;ary caution, if we con&s;ider the noble principles which influence all the actions, of Colonel Bellenden. His ge|nerous character could not be unknown to the Governor; and Mrs. Bellenden is, po&s;&s;ibly, not much in the wrong, when &s;he in&s;inuates, that his extreme caution was the re&s;ult of a thorough ac|quaintance with his own heart, which would not &s;uffer him to be &s;crupulous, if an advantageous offer for one of <HI>his</HI> daughters was made him.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. C&mdash; received the Governor's letter, he flew to the Fort, and entered Mrs. Bellenden's apartment with it open in his hand. She was be|ginning to condole with the di&s;appointed lover, when he interrupted her by ex|claiming, <Q>Was there ever any thing &s;o mortifying, Madam? here am I commanded to return to New-York;
<PB N="165" REF="167">
and &s;o I &s;hall lo&s;e the fine &s;ight you will have here &s;oon. This meeting with the Indians mu&s;t needs be very enter|taining, and would have afforded me &s;omething to talk of, when I returned to England. I never will forgive the Governor for playing me this trick.</Q></P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden, amazed and con|founded at this new ab&s;urdity, looked at him for a moment with great con|tempt.</P>
<P>'I KNOW not,' &s;aid &s;he, at la&s;t, <Q>whe|ther you will have any thing to talk of when you return to England, but I am &s;ure, whoever has &s;een and con|ver&s;ed with you, will have &s;omething to talk of as long as they live.</Q></P>
<P>HE bowed with the mo&s;t &s;atisfied air imaginable; then begged permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon Mi&s;s Clara.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168"><Q>WHY, what have you to &s;ay to her, Sir?</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Bellenden.</P>
<P>'SAY to her, Madam!' replied he, <Q>why &s;he has heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I am ordered back to New-York.</Q></P>
<P>'AND what then?' &s;aid Mrs. Bel|lenden.</P>
<P>'WHAT then, Madam!' repeated he, &s;taring at her with &s;igns of &s;urpri&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>'THIS order does not affect her,' re|&s;umed the lady, <Q><HI>&s;he</HI> will not lo&s;e the fine &s;ight.</Q>&mdash;She &s;miled.&mdash;The youth looked a little di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>'To be plain with you, Mr. C&mdash;,' pur&s;ued &s;he, <Q>Clara has received orders from her father, to &s;ee you no more. When your relations think proper to make any propo&s;als to Mr. Bellenden, it will then be time enough to con&s;i|der
<PB N="167" REF="169">
whether we will accept them or not.</Q></P>
<P>SOME company coming in, prevented any further di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject. Mr. C&mdash; being to &s;et out that af|ternoon, Mrs. Bellenden invited him to dinner; and as I was taking leave of her, &s;he followed me to the door of her apartment, and, in a whi&s;per, de&s;ired me to take Clara home with me, and to tell her, &s;he was permitted to pa&s;s the day at my hou&s;e. This offer was highly acceptable, both to the young lady and my&s;elf. The ridiculous character of her lover afforded us great diver&s;ion; and I could perceive &s;he was in tran&s;ports at being thus freed from his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden has &s;ince told me, that Mr. C&mdash; had not the lea&s;t ap|pearance of a de&s;pairing lover all dinner time, where he eat very heartily, and talked a great deal of nothing, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">THIS young man's volubility is really &s;urpri&s;ing. The rea&s;on Hudibras gives, why tho&s;e who talk on trifles &s;peak with the greate&s;t fluency, is, that the tongue is like a race-hor&s;e, which runs the fa&s;|ter the le&s;s weight it carries; and Mr. C&mdash; never fails to di&s;tance all his opponents.</P>
<P>BUT &s;carce was the cloth removed, and the &s;ervants retired, when &s;uddenly &s;tarting up, he, with a melancholy ear|ne&s;tne&s;s in his looks, begged the Colo|nel to give him audience for a few mo|ments in his clo&s;et&mdash;the Colonel com|plied. As &s;oon as they were entered, he &s;hut the door, and falling down upon his knees, with his hands cla&s;ped, and tears in his eyes, he implored the Colo|nel to give his con&s;ent, that the chap|lain might marry hirn to Mi&s;s Clara, be|fore he went away. The Colonel en|deavoured to rai&s;e him, and &s;miling, &s;aid, he a&s;ked a thing which his honour would not permit him to grant. But
<PB N="169" REF="171">
to get rid of his importunities, told him, that if my Lord H&mdash; would write to him, and give his free con&s;ent to his marriage with his daughter, he &s;hould have liberty to &s;ee her; but as <HI>her</HI> free con&s;ent was no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, he mu&s;t next endeavour to gain that.</P>
<P>THE young man, as if all difficulties were now removed, ro&s;e up in a tran&s;|port, ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and returning to the room where he had left Mrs. Bel|lenden and her two daughters, took leave of them very politely; the Colo|nel accompanying him to the water|&s;ide, where he &s;taid till he &s;aw him em|bark, on board the &s;loop that waited for him.</P>
<P>YESTERDAY the arrival of the Gover|nor was announced, by the firing of the cannon of the Fort. The river was covered with the &s;loops that carried his train, which was increa&s;ed by a crowd of per&s;ons, whom curio&s;ity induced to
<PB N="170" REF="172">
join them. Mrs. Bellenden took me in her coach to the water-&s;ide, to &s;ee the manner of his reception. His Excel|lency had rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with Co|lonel Bellenden's attention on this oc|ca&s;ion; he had never been welcomed, it was &s;aid, with equal di&s;tinction. I was &s;truck with this circum&s;tance, &s;o much to the honour of our commandant. Mrs. Bellenden and her daughters were in raptures, when the Colonel, at the head of the troops, &s;aluted the Governor as he pa&s;&s;ed. This ceremony, which is in it&s;elf very graceful, was performed by the Colonel with peculiar elegance, to which the dignity of his per&s;on and air greatly contributed.</P>
<P>THE Governor was attended by an immen&s;e crowd, to the hou&s;e that had been provided for him; for he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept of an apartment in the Fort, for fear of incommoding the fa|mily. He took notice to tho&s;e about him, of the particularly honourable re|ception,
<PB N="171" REF="173">
Colonel Bellenden had given him. And that he might not be out|done in genero&s;ity, took the very extra|ordinary re&s;olution of paying him a vi&s;it that &s;ame evening; accordingly, he &s;lipped away from the ob&s;equious crowd, and attended only by five or &s;ix gentlemen of his train, took his way on foot to the Fort.</P>
<P>I WAS walking with the ladies upon the ramparts, and the Colonel had ju&s;t joined us, when the centinels at the gate, &s;ent to inform him, that the Go|vernor was coming up the Fort-hill.</P>
<P>THE Colonel immediately ordered the guard to turn out to receive him; but Mr. Blood, the lieutenant who mounted guard that day, was not to be found.</P>
<P>COLONEL Bellenden, who without con&s;i|dering his rank, thought only of paying the Governor the accu&s;tomed honours,
<PB N="172" REF="174">
performed the duty of a lieutenant upon guard, headed the men him&s;elf, and &s;aluted the Governor as he entered the gates.</P>
<P>MR. Mountague, &s;urpri&s;ed, ran up to him with &s;ome precipitation; and laying hold of his pike, which he him|&s;elf gave into the hands of a &s;oldier, em|braced him with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;i|ons of kindne&s;s and re&s;pect, and arm in arm they walked together into the hou&s;e; where the Colonel introduced him to his wife and family.</P>
<P>THE Governor, who is a very well bred man, &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, by the po|litene&s;s of his compliments, the cloud upon Mrs. Bellenden's brow, who re|tained &s;ome re&s;entment in her heart again&s;t him, for the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;light they had received on Mr. C&mdash;'s account. His Excellency looked earne&s;tly at Clara, and &s;ingling her out, entered into &s;ome conver&s;ation with her. He
<PB N="173" REF="175">
afterwards &s;aid, to a gentleman in his company, who repeated it to Mr. Ne|ville, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed C&mdash;, who was a blockhead, had ta&s;te enough to fall in love with her.</P>
<P>HE was willing, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to prove that he did not condemn his ta&s;te; for when Mr. Blood, by the Colonel's orders, went to receive the watch-word from the Governor, the gallant old gen|tleman gave this young lady's name for the word; and, by his directions, the lieutenant repeated it aloud to the Colo|nel, before all the company, &s;aying&mdash;</P>
<P>'SIR, the word is&mdash;<HI>Clara.</HI>'</P>
<P>THIS piece of gallantry produced different effects on the company; Mrs. Bellenden looked plea&s;ed, Mi&s;s Bellen|den bit her lips almo&s;t through with &s;pite, Clara blu&s;hed, all were &s;urpri&s;ed, but Mr. Blood thought proper to a&s;|&s;ume a di&s;approving &s;neer.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176">'YOUR Excellency,' &s;aid the Colo|nel, <Q>has paid a dangerous compliment to the ladies; remember, it was a woman that betrayed the capitol.</Q></P>
<P>'AYE,' replied Mr. Mountague, wiih a &s;ide glance at Mr. Blood, who&s;e impertinent looks had not e&s;caped his notice, <Q>but it was a goo&s;e that &s;aved it&mdash;You may depend upon your lieu|tenant, I &s;uppo&s;e, Colonel?</Q></P>
<P>MR. Blood left the room, with fury in his countenance; and afterwards de|clared to Mr. Neville, that if Mr. Montague had not been commander in chief, he would have challenged him, for calling him, by implication, a goo&s;e. He continues violently out of humour, blu&s;ters, and talks big.</P>
<P>MRS. Ben&s;on diverts her&s;elf, and every one el&s;e, with the &s;ingularities of this doughty lieutenant. <Q>The whole man,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>as a wit once ob|&s;erved
<PB N="175" REF="177">
of &s;uch another Drawcan&s;ir, con|&s;i&s;ts only of a pair of black menacing brows, and two fierce mu&s;tachios; and, therefore, utterly to defeat him, there needs only three or four clips of a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. It is not po&s;&s;ible to be afraid of him in earne&s;t, for all his big looks.</Q> She thinks he hath choler enough, but does not believe he has any heart. She reckons him in the number of bea&s;ts that are &s;kitti&s;h and ru&s;ty, but not furi|ous and dangerous. The Colonel told her, he had been often in the field. <Q>I believe it,</Q> &s;he replied, <Q>but then it has been rather to feed than to fight.</Q></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>I WAS pre&s;ent to-day at the fir&s;t meeting between the Governor and the chiefs of the Indian tribes. The a&s;&s;em|bly was held in a large hall. &mdash;The Go|vernor &s;at in &s;tate, attended by all the officers and the gentlemen of his train; our commandant &s;at on his right hand;
<PB N="176" REF="178">
the mayor, and the other magi&s;trates, on his left. The Indian chiefs, who were placed oppo&s;ite to him, were vener|able old men; they &s;poke in turn by their interpreter, and delivered them|&s;elves gracefully enough. I regretted that I did not uhder&s;tand their language; I am told it is highly figurative. Their tone of voice is &s;oft and agreeable; and their pa&s;&s;ions, as it &s;hould &s;eem, very obe|dient; for although many matters were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, which included complaints, reproaches, and even threats, yet all was uttered with great gravity and com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE next day, the Governor gave them his an&s;wer. All was amicably &s;ettled; and on the third day, the go|vernment's pre&s;ents, to the amount of five hundred pounds, were di&s;tributed among the tribes. The ceremony con|cluded with one of their war dances, at which none of us women cho&s;e to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">THEY are now preparing to return home; a circum&s;tance which no one regrets. The rum, which was given them in large quantities, I think, very injudiciou&s;ly, produces a great many di&s;orders among them, and made them very di&s;agreeable neighbours.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>ALBANY is now quite de&s;erted. &mdash; The Governor is gone, and has carried away with him all our gaiety. We have lived for the&s;e ten days pa&s;t, in a conti|nual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of balls, entertainments, and parties of plea&s;ure; but they are over, and have left a melancholy void, which cannot be filled up with our u&s;ual &s;imple amu&s;ements. Mi&s;s Bellenden is fretful, Loui&s;a &s;olemn, and Clara &s;ilent and pen&s;ive.</P>
<P>MY departure from this place, is fixed for next month. &mdash;A new &s;ource of di&s;quiet among our little &s;ociety, in
<PB N="178" REF="180">
which the ab&s;ence of Mrs. Ben&s;on and my&s;elf, will be very &s;en&s;ibly felt, be|cau&s;e there are none to fill our places. However, Mi&s;s Bellenden will be ea&s;ily comforted, for &s;he has obtained leave of the Colonel and her mother, to &s;pend three months at New-York: Mi&s;s Loui&s;a goes with her. They are to be under the care of the wife of one of the prin|cipal merchants there, who is very de|&s;erving of &s;uch a tru&s;t.</P>
<P>CLARA thinks her&s;elf happy, in being indulged in her reque&s;t of remaining at home; &s;he has lo&s;t much of her u&s;ual &s;prightline&s;s; a &s;oft and gentle melan|choly appears in her looks, and runs through all her conver&s;ation. It is the opinion of her family, and her friends, that her heart has received a deep, im|pre&s;&s;ion in favour of Mr. Eu&s;ton; but this circum&s;tance, which her mode&s;ty and re&s;erve have concealed from her&s;elf; no one would be indelicate enough to hint to her. His acknowledged merit,
<PB N="179" REF="181">
and the re&s;pectful pa&s;&s;ion he expre&s;&s;ed for her, might well produce this effect. I believe Mrs. Bellenden now thinks, &s;he was rather too precipitate in rejecting his propo&s;als, &s;ince her favourite &s;cheme has not taken place.</P>
<P>MR. Eu&s;ton is actually gone to Eng|land; Clara was pre&s;ent when the Co|lonel mentioned it, as a piece of news he had ju&s;t heard; every one carefully avoided looking at her. As I &s;at clo&s;e to her, I could hear her hem away a &s;igh; &s;he left the room on &s;ome pretence &s;oon af|terwards, and when &s;he returned, no other alteration appeared in her counte|nance, than that her &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s was a little encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden, with a view to divert her daughter, as well as to oblige me, has given her leave to be of my party to Schonectady. Mr. Neville propo&s;ed this little excur&s;ion, in order to take a view of the fort he is to command there, and
<PB N="180" REF="182">
to acquire &s;ome knowledge of the place, and the inhabitants among whom we are &s;oon to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>FROM thence we are to go to Fort-Hunter; where we &s;hall have an oppor|tunity of becoming acquainted with the Mohawks, a tribe of the Iroquois, who are converted to Chri&s;tianity, and have their village, or ca&s;tle, as they call it, in the neighbourhood of that fort. We reckon upon being ab&s;ent a week upon this excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>MRS. Bellenden in&s;i&s;ts upon having my little boy with her, till my return; he will be attended by Fanny, of whom he is exce&s;&s;ively fond, and who&s;e care and tenderne&s;s I can depend upon; &s;o that I have nothing to make me unea&s;y, but a &s;eparation, which, however, will be but for a &s;hort time. I &s;hall now clo&s;e this packet, and leave it with the Colonel, that if any opportunity offers, while I am away, of &s;ending it to New-York

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. MRS. NEVILLE TO MRS. HARLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Schonectady.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEVER go far from home without carrying with me materials for writ|ing, that I may &s;eize every opportunity of conver&s;ing with you in idea, at lea&s;t; an employment which con&s;titutes one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of my life.</P>
<P>WE arrived here, after a very plea|&s;ant journey, early in the evening. Lieutenant Granger came out to meet us, and conducted us to his little for|tre&s;s, which we found a very &s;imple &s;ructure. The town, or rather village,
<PB N="183" REF="185">
(for &s;o it is in appearance) con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall number of hou&s;es, built in the Dutch ta&s;te, and inhabited only by per|&s;ons who carry on a trade with our In|dian allies. &mdash;No language but Dutch is &s;poke here. There are &s;ome planta|tions plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and the country about is romantic and picture&s;que.</P>
<P>MRS. Granger is a Dutch woman, a little more poli&s;hed than her neigh|bours; an advantage which &s;he owes to the conver&s;ation and in&s;tructions of her hu&s;band, who is a civil well bred man. She talks Engli&s;h tolerably well, and gave me all the information I could ex|pect concerning the place, the people, and the manner of living here.</P>
<P>OBSERVING that I &s;ighed two or three times during her di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he told me, that to be &s;ure, it was not &s;o <HI>fine</HI> a place as Albany, and the people were not &s;o rich, nor lived &s;o grand, but that my hu&s;band might &s;ave a great
<PB N="184" REF="186">
deal of money here, and that you know, &s;aid &s;he, is the chief thing to be con|&s;idered in this world.</P>
<P>I COULD not help &s;miling at this re|mark, which &s;he took for a &s;ign that I under&s;tood the force of her argument perfectly well.</P>
<P>I DO not find that I &s;hall be tempted to make any acquaintance here, unle&s;s it is with an old lady, of whom &s;he gave me this account; that &s;he is an Engli&s;h woman, the widow of an officer who once commanded here, and whom &s;he has &s;urvived near twenty years.</P>
<P>'WHEN her hu&s;band died,' &s;aid Mrs. Granger, <Q>&s;he re&s;olved never to leave the place, but to die here her&s;elf, that &s;he might be buried with him; &s;o &s;he built her&s;elf a pretty little hou&s;e near the &s;kirts of the town, and lives upon her pen&s;ion and the profits of her negroes work: &s;he has four of them, and they

<P><Q>SHE has other odd fancies too; for when &s;he &s;tands godmother to a child, as &s;oon as it is three years old, &s;he takes it, whether boy or girl, and breeds it up till it is ten years old, teaching it Engli&s;h and French, and writing and accompts, for &s;he is very learned.

<P>MRS. Ben&s;on and Mr. Neville are very bu&s;y in projecting alterations and improvements in the hou&s;e and garden.

<P>WE have been here two days. Our ho&s;pitable ho&s;t is very unwilling to part with us, and pre&s;&s;ed us much to vi&s;it the Falls of Cohas in his company. Accordingly, we &s;et out the next morn|ing in a kind of covered waggon, in which our whole party was very well accommo|dated. We had clear uninterrupted

&s;un&s;hine, not a cloud appearing above the horizon, and very little wind at all. However, when we came near the Fall, there was a continual drizzling rain, occa&s;ioned by the vapours which ro&s;e from the water during its fall, and was carried about by the wind, &s;o that our clothes were wetted as if there had been a &s;hower of rain. This cataract, which is in the river Mohawk before it falls into Hud&s;on's river, is &s;aid to be very remarkable. Both above and below are &s;olid rocks; the rock there, Mr. Granger told us, is three hundred yards broad. At the fall there is a rock cro&s;&s;ways in the river, running every where equally high, and cro&s;&s;ing in a &s;traight line with that &s;ide that forms the fall: it repre&s;ents, as it were, a wall towards the other &s;ide, which is not quite perpendicular. The heighth of this rock over which the water rolls, ap|pears to be about four-and-twenty yards. We carried a cold collation with us, and dined very comfortably in

<P>WE reached this place early in the afternoon. The river, which is navi|gable for &s;everal miles beyond it, af|forded us a mo&s;t delightful pa&s;&s;age, though in a canoe which was rowed with paddles by four careful Dutchmen, who ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence all the time. We were often willing to interrupt it, by a&s;king &s;everal que&s;tions which curio&s;ity &s;ugge&s;ted, but to no purpo&s;e, for they were not di&s;po&s;ed to be in the lea&s;t communicative.</P>
<P>THIS frail and &s;imple ve&s;&s;el, which was nothing more than a large tree hol|lowed, at the bottom of which we &s;at upon mats and bear &s;kins, carried us &s;wiftly up the &s;tream, while on each &s;ide our eyes wandered over the wild but

charming &s;cenes of the romantic &s;hores, detatched woods, adding beauty to the tops of the verdant mountains, ca&s;t a &s;weet yet dreadful gloom on either hand; and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the gentle da&s;hing of the little oars, di&s;po&s;ed the mind to no unplea&s;ing melancholy.</P>
<P>CLARA, lo&s;t in thought, was only rou&s;ed from her reverie by the &s;houts of a number of Indians, who were ranged along the &s;hore near, the place where we were to land. Several of them jump|ed officiou&s;ly into the river, and drew the canoe on &s;hore. Mr. Butler, who loves parade it &s;eems, received the daughter of the commandant with great ceremony. The flag was di&s;played on the ba&s;tion; and the guard drawn up; a great croud of Indians followed us to the gates, and &s;ome of the chiefs were permitted to enter, one of whom, in a &s;et &s;peech of &s;everal minutes, addre&s;&s;ed to Clara, invited us, as we were told by Mr. Butler, to their ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">TO-DAY, being Sunday, we heard di|vine &s;ervice in the Mohawk chapel, which is a pretty neat building. A great deal of finery is di&s;played on the pulpit and the altar, and there is &s;ome fine wrought plate for the communion table.</P>
<P>THE chaplain preached in Dutch. Every &s;entence of the &s;ermon was re|peated to the Mohawks in their own language by an interpreter. The com|mon-prayer and the P&s;alms are tran&s;lat|ed into the Mohawk tongue, and I ob|&s;erved that many of the Indians had their books in their hands.</P>
<P>I NEVER heard the P&s;alms &s;ung more delightfully. The voices of the men are &s;trong and clear; tho&s;e of the wo|men exqui&s;itely melodious. We walk often on the ramparts, from whence we have a fine view of the country and the Indian plantations, where all the work is done by the women, the &s;ole

<P>THESE poor females work in the fields with one or more infants at their backs; and thus encumbered, bring home heavy burdens, their hu&s;bands being too lazy and too in&s;olent to partake their labours.</P>
<P>We went to vi&s;it the Indian town to|day, well accompanied; for Captain Butler ordered &s;ome of the &s;oldiers to attend us, in appearance to do us ho|nour, but in reality to quiet our weak apprehen&s;ions, which he had in vain endeavoured to convince us was very ill founded. But it was not po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade us we were &s;afe without a

<P>Wa were obliged, in order to avoid giving offence by an appearance of pre|ference, to enter the hou&s;es or <HI>wig|wams,</HI> as the Indians call them, of all who invited us. Mo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>wigwams</HI> were large enough to accommodate &s;everal families, each of which occu|pied no more than a &s;quare of eight or ten feet, that contained their bed, and a few other nece&s;&s;aries. The fire-place, which is in the middle of the hut, and is common to all, had a large opening in the roof to let out the &s;moke, of which however &s;ufficient remained to blind us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;quaus,</HI> &s;o the Indian women are called, were extremely plea&s;ed with the notice we took of their children; and, in return for the pre&s;ents we made them,
<PB N="193" REF="195">
gave us garters compo&s;ed of wampom, &s;trung in figures, and dyed of the mo&s;t beautiful colours imaginable.</P>
<P>THE principal chief of this nation has a hou&s;e built and furni&s;hed in the Eu|ropean ta&s;te, for he is fond of imitating our manners; and here we actually drank tea; the <HI>&s;quau,</HI> his lady, being ambitious to entertain us.</P>
<P>THIS Indian chief thought proper to confer the honour of adoption upon Mi&s;s Clara, as his brother did upon me. This is con&s;idered as a high mark of re&s;pect among them, which conferred upon us all the rights and claims of a Mo|hawk by birth. We each of us receiv|ed an Indian name upon this occa&s;ion. Their names always bear a relation to &s;ome real or imputed quality of body or mind. Clara's &s;ignified the morning &s;tar, and mine an ear of Indian wheat, denoting fruitfulne&s;s, for my pre&s;ent &s;ituation was not unnoticed by them.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">THE ceremony concluded with one of their terrific dances, which we be|held from the ramparts of the Fort.

<P>YOUR reproaches for our long &s;i|lence would be ju&s;t, had any thing but the &s;evere&s;t of all calamities, pro|duced this &s;eeming neglect. Your ami|able, and now unhappy friend, Madam, concluded her la&s;t letter to you in a &s;train, not only of content, but joy. &mdash; Her will wholly re&s;igned to her pre&s;ent fortune, her heart glowing with the mo&s;t delightful hopes of the future, &s;he was eager to communicate, to her be|loved friend, part of the tran&s;ports that filled her brea&s;t. Ah! what a rever&s;e, in the &s;pace of a few months, did &s;he
<PB N="200" REF="202">
experience! But take the melancholy tale in order, &s;ince I have now acquired compo&s;ure enough to give you all the circum&s;tances of it.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of Mr. Neville's, whom &s;ome private affairs had brought to New-York, accepted his invitation to &s;tay a few days with us at Schonectady. Mr. Neville carried him to every place wor|thy his notice; the Falls of Cohas he had not yet &s;een, and a day was fixed upon for this little excur&s;ion. Mrs. Neville would willingly have avoided being of the party, the little Maria not being yet weaned; but Mr. Neville having re&s;olved to take his &s;on with him, the tender anxious mother would not &s;tay behind.</P>
<P>ALL our party were in high &s;pirits, except Mrs. Neville; her heart &s;eemed to labour with &s;ome unknown oppre&s;|&s;ion, her &s;peech was often interrupted with &s;ighs, an air of melancholy over|&s;pread her face. I a&s;ked her &s;everal
<PB N="201" REF="203">
times, if &s;he was well: &s;he a&s;&s;ured me &s;he felt no other di&s;order, but a &s;trange tremor on her &s;pirits, for which &s;he could not account.</P>
<P>OBSERVING Mr. Neville to appear di&s;&s;atisfied, at her being le&s;s chearful than u&s;ual, &s;he endeavoured to di&s;pel the gloom that hung upon her, and met his contracted brow with her wonted &s;mile of complacency.</P>
<P>I MARKED the painful effort&mdash;I &s;aw the &s;tarting tears that gli&s;tened in tho&s;e eyes, which &s;he turned upon him with an a&s;&s;umed chearfulne&s;s. Unea&s;y and apprehen&s;ive, I whi&s;pered, <Q>My dear Euphemia, you are not well.</Q> <Q>I am well, indeed I am,</Q> &s;he replied; <Q>but my &s;pirits are uncommonly low to|day, that is all.</Q></P>
<P>OUR gue&s;t having &s;ufficiently &s;atis|fied his curio&s;ity with the view of the cataract, our &s;ervants &s;pread a cloth
<PB N="202" REF="204">
upon the ru&s;tic table, in the hut where we had dined before; and a cold col|lation being provided, we all &s;at down to it. But the keenne&s;s of that appetite, which I had borrowed from the air, and unu&s;ual exerci&s;e, was in&s;tantly checked, when I perceived that Mrs. Neville could not eat, but trifled with her knife and fork, in order to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen drank their wine pretty freely; meantime, my dear Eu|phemia, heavy from fatigue, and yet more with the unu&s;ual weight that op|pre&s;&s;ed her mind, gave the &s;miling in|fant, that hong upon her brea&s;t, into Fanny's arms, who &s;at next her; and reclining her head upon a mo&s;&s;y pillow, fell into a profound &s;leep.</P>
<P>MR. Neville now ro&s;e up, and pro|po&s;ed to his friend to walk into the woods, till the &s;ervants had dined, and the carriages were ready for our depar|ture.
<PB N="203" REF="205">
They took little Edward with them, that his innocent prattle might not interrupt his mother's repo&s;e; and, attended only by Mr. Neville's own &s;er|vant, they &s;et out upon their walk.</P>
<P>MRS. Neville &s;lept &s;ound and ea&s;y; I was happy in the hope, that this &s;alu|tary re&s;t would re&s;tore her &s;trength and &s;pirits. When Fanny &s;aid, &s;oftly, <Q>Are you not &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam, that Mr. Neville &s;tays &s;o long?</Q> I had never thought of this circum&s;tance; I looked at my watch, and was a&s;toni&s;hed to find it &s;o late.</P>
<P>THAT in&s;tant Mr. Neville entered the hut; with wild impatience in his look and accent, he enquired if Edward was with us.</P>
<P>'WITH us!' &s;aid I, trembling, <Q>did he not go with you?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">'OH! Sutton,' &s;aid Mr. Neville to his friend, who had followed him, <Q>my boy is not here!</Q></P>
<P>THIS exclamation was uttered &s;o loud, that it awoke Mrs. Neville; her hu&s;|band &s;eeing her open her eyes, ru&s;hed out of the hut, and was followed by his friend. Fanny and I remained mo|tionle&s;s; fear and amazement &s;trongly pictured in her face, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, in mine; for Mrs. Neville, &s;urpri&s;ed at her hu&s;band's abrupt departure, turned towards us to a&s;k the rea&s;on; but at the fir&s;t glance, &s;he uttered a piercing &s;hriek.</P>
<P>'AH! I under&s;tand tho&s;e looks,' &s;aid &s;he, turning her eyes alternately upon Fanny and me; <Q>&s;ome dreadful acci|dent has happened&mdash;My dear boy! my Edward! is he dead? Oh! tell me, I conjure you,</Q> pur&s;ued &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands together, <Q>tell me the truth&mdash; is my child dead?</Q> Her &s;upplicating
<PB N="205" REF="207">
look and action, pierced my heart. 'Heaven forbid!' was all I could &s;ay. 'Then he is not dead,' &s;aid &s;he; <Q>Heaven by prai&s;ed! I breathe again; from what agonizing pangs am I re|lieved! Oh! if you knew what I felt in that dreadful moment of &s;u&s;pence, which realized all the &s;trange forebod|ings that have tortured my imagina|tion this day.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Neville's &s;ervant that moment appeared at the door, and rolling his eager enquiring eyes about the place, exclaimed&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>OH! he is not here! he is lo&s;t! I &s;hall go mad!</Q></P>
<P>MRS. Neville &s;tarting up, cried, <Q>who is lo&s;t? &mdash;My child! tell me&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>'OH! detain me not, Madam,' &s;aid he, for &s;he held him by the arm; <Q>let me go in &s;earch of him, I will find
<PB N="206" REF="208">
him, or never return.</Q> He broke from her loo&s;ened hold; &s;he ru&s;hed out after him, with a di&s;tracted pace. Un|able to follow her, I received the &s;leep|ing infant out of Fanny's arms, who flew after her mi&s;erable mi&s;tre&s;s, and both were in an in&s;tant concealed from my &s;ight by the impervious woods.</P>
<P>THUS de&s;olate, alone, my heart torn with angui&s;h, expecting every moment to hear of &s;ome new calamity, no crea|ture of whom I could make any inqui|ries, for all our people had di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves about the fore&s;t in &s;earch of the dear lo&s;t boy; trembling le&s;t the baby &s;hould awake, and pre&s;t by wants I had no means of &s;upplying, rent my afflicted heart with its tender wailings, I abandoned my&s;elf, I own it, I aban|doned my&s;elf, for a few moments, to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>REFLECTION at length returned, and brought with it &s;ober councils.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209">'Is this,' &s;aid I to my&s;elf, <Q>the part of a Chri&s;tian, to &s;hrink thus meanly in the hour of trial? where is that confidence in the goodne&s;s, that re&s;ignation to the will of God, which, till I was called upon to exert, I thought I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? Alas! in health and happy days, it is ea&s;y to talk of put|ting our tru&s;t in God; we readily tru&s;t him for life when we have health, for nece&s;&s;aries when we have compe|tence, and for deliverance when we have e&s;caped from any danger; but when dangers a&s;&s;ault, when calamities op|pre&s;s us, we forget that he is powerful to &s;ave, and compa&s;&s;ionate to relieve.</Q></P>
<P>I PURSUED this train of thought; and every moment, as a pious re&s;ignation gained upon my &s;oul, I ble&s;&s;ed, I adored the &s;acred power of religion, that could thus produce good out of evil, and make my pre&s;ent affliction the means of attaining eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="210">THE calm uninterrupted &s;leep of the infant, afforded in my altered mind, matter for gratitude and prai&s;e; for how could I have &s;tilled its cries, or procure proper food for it in this de&s;ert, unu&s;ed, as it had hitherto been, to any nouri&s;h|ment but its fond mother's milk. &mdash;It &s;lept, while I wept over it with tender|ne&s;s, and prayed with &s;ervor.</P>
<P>AT length I heard the &s;ound of &s;teps; I turned my eager eyes, my beloved Eu|phemia appeared, Mr. Sutton and her faithful Fanny &s;upporting her. Now quick, now &s;low, was her flaultering pace; her countenance pale as death; her eyes, one in&s;tant rai&s;ed to Heaven with &s;upplicating tears, the next in wild de&s;pondence fixed on the ground; her clo&s;ed hands wringing each other as if &s;he would bur&s;t their &s;inews.</P>
<P>SHE threw her&s;elf on the bank be&s;ide me, without uttering a word; one ten|der glance &s;he ca&s;t upon her &s;leeping in|&s;ant
<PB N="209" REF="211">
in my arms, then bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>MR. Sutton begged her to compo&s;e her&s;elf if po&s;&s;ible, &s;aying, he would go again into the woods, and never give over his &s;earch, till he could bring her &s;ome news of her &s;on. He went away in&s;tantly; and I took occa&s;ion from his la&s;t word, to draw &s;ome motives of con|&s;olation for her.</P>
<P><Q>OH! do not amu&s;e me with fal&s;e hopes,</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q>I &s;hall never more &s;ee my child. He is, doubt it not, he is a prey to &s;avage bea&s;ts, or &s;avage men, &s;till wor&s;e than bea&s;ts. Oh! thou delight of my heart and eyes, was this the fate to which thou wert born? &mdash;Mangled&mdash;torn&mdash;devoured&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>AT this &s;ad thought &s;he &s;hrieked aloud, and &s;unk lifele&s;s into Fanny's arms. With difficulty we recovered
<PB N="210" REF="212">
her; but it was but for a moment; &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fainting fits made us tremble for her life.</P>
<P>STILL I indulged &s;ome gleams of hope, that the &s;weet boy might yet be found. But when Mr. Neville returned, his frantic looks proclaimed the irremida|ble calamity.</P>
<P>'HE is lo&s;t!' groaned he out, <Q>he is gone! &mdash;for ever gone!</Q></P>
<P>'AH!' cried I, '&s;ee here,' pointing to his wife, who lay pale and motionle&s;s on Fanny's knees. &mdash;He gazed on her for a moment&mdash;</P>
<P>'WHAT is to be done?' &s;aid he; <Q>tell me, advi&s;e me.</Q></P>
<P>'BY all means,' &s;aid Mr. Sutton, <Q>let Mrs. Neville be carried home; place her in the carriage, thus in&s;en&s;i|ble
<PB N="211" REF="213">
as &s;he is; believe it, when &s;he re|covers &s;en&s;e and thought, it will be difficult to get her from hence.</Q></P>
<P>THIS, in the &s;ad extremity to which we were reduced, was the be&s;t thing that could be done. Fanny got into the coach, and received her, &s;till faint|ing, in her arms; I placed my&s;elf op|po&s;ite to them with the child, who&s;e &s;leep &s;eemed, by Providence, to be pro|longed for our comfort.</P>
<P>MR. Neville declared he would not leave the place, but continue his &s;earch till he found his &s;on dead or alive. His friend &s;taid with him, and the unhappy &s;ervant to who&s;e care the child had been entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>THIS man, in his looks and beha|viour, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t poignant re|mor&s;e and agonizing grief; accu&s;ing him|&s;elf, with floods of tears, as being the cau&s;e of what had happened. It &s;eems the

Overcome with the heat, and lulled by the da&s;hing &s;ound of the cataract, which may be heard at a great di&s;tance, they fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>THE man awakening, mi&s;&s;ed the child; and not yet much alarmed, &s;up|po&s;ing he had only &s;trayed a few paces from him, called him &s;everal times aloud, and ran about in &s;earch of him. Not finding him, his fears increa&s;ed; he wandered through the woods, &s;till call|ing him in vain: then fondly hoping, that he &s;hould meet him, perhaps, in the place where he had &s;o unfortunately fallen a&s;leep, he returned thither; but in&s;tead of the child, &s;aw Mr. Sutton and his ma&s;ter, who were looking for them.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">MR. Neville &s;eeing him alone, ex|claimed, with an eager look and tone, 'Where is Edward?' The man, con|founded, terrified, amazed, an&s;wered not a word. Mr. Neville, in a tran&s;port of fear and rage, &s;eized him by the col|lar, and giving him a violent &s;hake, 'Ra&s;cal,' &s;aid he, <Q>have you lo&s;t my &s;on?</Q></P>
<P>'OH! Sir,' cried the trembling wretch, <Q>the child, tired with walking, fell a&s;leep upon my knees; unhappily, I dropt a&s;leep likewi&s;e, and when I waked, he was gone; I have been in &s;earch of him ever &s;ince.</Q></P>
<P>MR. Neville, now worked up almo&s;t to a delirium of fury, drew his &s;word, and had not Mr. Sutton held his arm, the poor fellow had fallen a victim to the tempe&s;t that raged within his &s;oul.</P>
<P>'LET us go in &s;earch of your child,' &s;aid his friend to him; <Q>let us take dif|ferent ways.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"><Q>WHAT, hope of finding him &s;afe in the&s;e wild woods!</Q> &s;aid the &s;ighing fa|ther: <Q>Ere this he is become a prey to &s;ome furious animal, or &s;ome human &s;avage. &mdash;My fears di&s;tract me.</Q></P>
<P>WITH a furious pace he ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the woods, calling his &s;on. Mr. Sutton took a different path; as did the weeping &s;ervant. Alas! all were un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE motion of the carriage, aided by &s;ome drops that Fanny applied, at length brought Mrs. Neville out of her faint|ing fit. With her &s;en&s;es, recollection &mdash;dreaful recollection! returned. She appeared not to con&s;ider where &s;he was, or whither &s;he was going, but groaned as if in the agonies of death. I begged her not to bani&s;h hope; that there was at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility the child might be &s;afe; that Mr. Neville and his friend were &s;till in &s;earch of him; that en|quiries would be made at every farm|hou&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="217">
for many miles around, and that &s;o many per&s;ons would be employed in &s;eeking him; that we were &s;ure of hav|ing &s;ome intelligence.</P>
<P>'COULD you think it po&s;&s;ible,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>that I &s;hould ever be &s;o tran&s;|cendently mi&s;erable as to wi&s;h I may hear my boy is dead by a fall, by a &s;udden fit, or that he is drowned; but, oh! to have him torn in pieces by wild bea&s;ts, or mangled by tho&s;e &s;avage hunters of men, who, when hunger pre&s;&s;es, devour their &s;pecies. &mdash;Can I think that this is his fate, and not be mad? Talk not to me of hope. &mdash;Oh! when I think what my child has &s;uffered, and is, perhaps, &s;uffering now!</Q> &mdash;Again her &s;pirits, her &s;en&s;es for&s;ook her. Scarce did it &s;eem charity to u&s;e any efforts to recover her from this &s;tate of in&s;en|&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218">IN the&s;e temporary deaths, from which our cares re&s;cued her only to fall into them again, was this melancholy journey pa&s;&s;ed. At length we reached the Fort; we carried her up to her chamber, we put her to bed; a violent fever &s;eized her; her ravings &s;hewed the horrid images that filled her imagi|nation.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw her &s;on in the paws of a wild bea&s;t; &s;ome|times &s;prawling upon the lance of &s;ome ferocious Indian, writhing in the ago|nies of death. Her cries, her heart|rending complaints, filled all who heard her with the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. Mrs. Law&s;on &s;hared in all my &s;orrows and all my fatigue on this &s;ad event.</P>
<P>FROM the Bellenden family we experienced every effort of tender &s;ym|pathizing friend&s;hip. A very &s;kilful phy|&s;ician was, by their means, brought
<PB N="217" REF="219">
from New-York. He gave us little hope, and her death was hourly ex|pected.</P>
<P>MR. Neville returned, after an ab|&s;ence of eight days, which he had &s;pent in ince&s;&s;ant wanderings, with beating heart. We crouded round him as &s;oon. as he appeared:-''Tis all over,' &s;aid he; <Q>there is no more room for hope or fear&mdash;my boy is dead.</Q></P>
<P>'THE manner,' cried I, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with terror&mdash; <Q>tell us the man|ner of his death.</Q></P>
<P>'HEAVEN be prai&s;ed!' &s;aid he, <Q>that was not &s;o horrid as I feared &mdash; he was drowned&mdash;he had &s;trayed too near the river, he fell in. A countryman, (for William has not been heard of &s;ince) &s;aw the lifele&s;s cor&s;e of the dear in|nocent carried away by the &s;tream.</Q> &mdash; A bur&s;t of grief here &s;topped his &s;peech for a moment; then recovering&mdash; <Q>Tell
<PB N="218" REF="220">
me <HI>your</HI> tale of horror now,</Q> &s;aid he; 'my wife, where is &s;he?'</P>
<P>MRS. Law&s;on with &s;ome caution in|formed him of her condition, and would have prevented him from going into her chamber, but the phy&s;ician was of opi|nion that the &s;ight of him might have an effect very contrary to what we fear|ed. She had known none of us for &s;e|veral days, and &s;till continued to rave, and paint tho&s;e horrid &s;cenes that filled her tortured imagination.</P>
<P>MR. Neville ju&s;t &s;hewed him&s;elf. She &s;tarted&mdash;&s;he &s;creamed&mdash;he retired. She ro&s;e up in her bed, and eagerly drew back the curtain.</P>
<P>'WHERE is he?' &s;aid &s;he; <Q>did I not &s;ee him?</Q></P>
<P>'WHO, my dear Euphemia,' &s;aid I, 'who did you &s;ee?'</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">'MY hu&s;band,' &s;he replied; <Q>where is he gone? why will you not let him come to me?</Q></P>
<P>TRANSPORTED at this in&s;tance of her returning rea&s;on, I called to him to ap|proach. She &s;eized his hand with an eager pre&s;&s;ure&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>HAVE you found his mangled limbs?</Q> &s;aid &s;he: <Q>have you buried him? Was he, Oh! tell me, was he not devoured?</Q></P>
<P>MR. Neville was &s;ilent, not knowing what to &s;ay to her, when the phy&s;ician interpo&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>'TELL her the truth,' &s;aid he; <Q>the truth will be le&s;s dreadful than the horrid ideas that po&s;&s;e&s;s her fancy.</Q></P>
<P>'MY dear Euphemia,' &s;aid Mr. Ne|ville, <Q>be patient, be re&s;igned &mdash; our child was drowned.</Q> &mdash; She pau&s;ed a
<PB N="220" REF="222">
moment; then looking earne&s;tly at him &mdash;</P>
<P>'You &s;ay he was drowned,' &s;aid &s;he; 'are you &s;ure of it?' The phy&s;ician whi&s;pered&mdash; 'Say you &s;aw him dead.'</P>
<P>'ALAS!' &s;aid he, <Q>I am too &s;ure of it.</Q></P>
<P>'Now then I may weep,' &s;aid &s;he, after a pau&s;e of a moment&mdash; <Q>now I may grieve; it is &s;orrow now, before it was di&s;traction. Oh! my dear boy, you are dead, I &s;hall never &s;ee you more; but you was not devoured.</Q> She threw her arms about my neck as I was leaning over her; and hiding her face in my bo&s;om, bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>OH! how I ble&s;t the &s;alutary &s;hower; and, although I felt that the &s;trong agony of &s;orrow &s;hook her whole frame as I held her in my arms, yet, while her tears bedewed my bo&s;om, I was chear|ed
<PB N="221" REF="223">
with the hope of a favourable change in her di&s;temper.</P>
<P>FATIGUED at length, and almo&s;t fainting, her head &s;unk upon her pil|low, &s;he clo&s;ed her eyes, and but for the frequent &s;ighs that forced their way, we &s;hould have thought, her dead.</P>
<P>THE phy&s;ician, who had cau&s;ed a compo&s;ing medicine to be prepared for her, now gave it her him&s;elf. She &s;wallowed it without uttering a word or opening her eyes, and &s;oon afterwards fell into a profound &s;leep, that la&s;ted &s;everal hours.</P>
<P>THIS fir&s;t &s;ymptom of her amend|ment was followed by others that con|firmed our hopes. When &s;he awoke &s;he knew us all; de&s;ired to &s;ee the little Maria, who had been con&s;igned to Fanny's care, and was perfectly well. She ki&s;&s;ed and ble&s;&s;ed her; &s;poke with great tenderne&s;s to her hu&s;band, and
<PB N="222" REF="224">
thanked Mrs. Law&s;on for her friendly attention. To me &s;he &s;poke not, but held my hand fa&s;t cla&s;ped in hers, and &s;ometimes pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips. She often &s;ighed, and I could ob&s;erve tears &s;teal down her cheeks continually.</P>
<P>IN this calm &s;ilent &s;orrow &s;he remain|ed &s;everal days; meantime her fever abated fa&s;t; the phy&s;ician pronounced her out of danger; and all we had now to do, he &s;aid, was to endeavour to recruit her &s;trength and &s;pirits. Mrs. Bellen|den came her&s;elf to fetch her to Al|bany; and it &s;eemed to be the chief bu|&s;ine&s;s of the whole family to &s;oothe, to comfort, and amu&s;e her.</P>
<P>PATIENT now as &s;uffering infancy, and full of devout re&s;ignation, her grief is calm, &s;edate, and &s;ilent; but &s;till &s;he grieves. She has lo&s;t her u&s;ual chear|fulne&s;s, but the &s;en&s;iblity of her heart is increa&s;ed; always tender and com|pa&s;&s;ionate, &s;he is now more &s;o than
<PB N="223" REF="225">
ever, and feels for the woes of others as if &s;he had none of her own to lament.</P>
<P>I LOVE, I admire her if po&s;&s;ible more than ever. Well has it been &s;aid, that adver&s;ity is the &s;hining time of the wi&s;e and good. None are more mi&s;erable than tho&s;e who never experienced cala|mity; how can it be known whether they be good or bad? Such virtues as are only faculties and di&s;po&s;itions, de|&s;erve little prai&s;e; but every <HI>act</HI> of vir|tue has in it&s;elf the principles of its own reward.</P>
<P>SUCH arguments as the&s;e I pre&s;&s;ed upon my dear Euphemia, when I apprehend|ed her grief for the lo&s;s of her &s;on would exceed the bounds her good &s;en&s;e and piety &s;eemed to pre&s;cribe to it. I put her in mind of the noble &s;tand &s;he made again&s;t immoderate &s;orrow, when &s;he lo&s;t her excellent mother; a lo&s;s that was followed by many cruel di&s;appoint|ments and mortifications.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226">'ALAS!' &s;he replied, <Q>it is but an accidental fortitude we can boa&s;t, when we bear misfortunes &s;o unequally. I know&mdash;I feel my weakne&s;s, but I am not able to overcome it.</Q> The &s;ighs and tears that accompanied this con|fe&s;&s;ion, proved its truth.'</P>
<P>'No affliction, my child,' &s;aid I, <Q>is greater than de&s;pair; it turns a natural evil into an intolerable one, and con|&s;titutes the puni&s;hment to which the wicked are condemned.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I found a calm and &s;teady re|&s;ignation take the place of that poignant angui&s;h which had &s;o long filled her heart: When I &s;aw her return to her u&s;ual employments, if not with equal vicacity, yet with an air &s;erene and com|po&s;ed: When I &s;aw her cares for the little Maria give full employment for her maternal tenderne&s;s, without any of tho&s;e &s;ad retro&s;pective thoughts which u&s;ed to ca&s;t a damp upon the plea&s;ure
<PB N="225" REF="227">
&s;he received from the innocent care&s;&s;es of this lovely child: then my hopes of her returning peace were confirm|ed. I congratulated her upon a change, &s;o ardently de&s;ired by her friends, &s;o &s;alutary for her&s;elf. Never &s;hall I forget her look and accent when &s;he thus an&s;wered me: &mdash;</P>
<P><Q>MY dear Mrs. Ben&s;on; tho&s;e who will not &s;uffer their portion of mi&s;ery here, de&s;erve to be &s;omething le&s;s than human, but nothing better.</Q></P>
<P>THUS, Madam, have I fulfilled the &s;ad ta&s;k my &s;ituation impo&s;ed upon me, of giving you this &s;ad narrative. You will weep&mdash;you will mourn for the &s;ufferings of your amiable friend; but when you have paid that tender tribute to her misfortunes, remember, that &s;he is no longer in the fir&s;t paroxi&s;ms of her grief; that while your imagination repre|&s;ents her &s;inking beneath their weight, rea&s;on and religion have produced that
<PB N="226" REF="228" MS="y">
re&s;ignation, which philo&s;ophy teaches, but which true piety alone can reach.</P>
<P>THAT heaven may pre&s;erve you from &s;uch &s;evere trials, is my fir&s;t and ardent wi&s;h; that your fortitude and patience may be equal to her's, my next. I am, with great truth, Madam, your faithful humble &s;ervant,</P>
