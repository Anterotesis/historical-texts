<P>LE DESERTEUR, is well known to have been the&s;e five years the mo&s;t fa|vourite Mu&s;ical Piece on the French &s;tage: &s;o great indeed has been its &s;ucce&s;s, that in this &s;hort time it has been tran&s;lated into three languages; one of which tran&s;lations we have lately &s;een at the King's Theatre in the Hay-market, under the title of <HI>Il De&s;er|tore.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, when you once admit the circum|&s;tance of Henry's con&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a de|&s;erter, nothing can be more truly intere&s;ting than &s;ome of the incidents; but yet they were brought about in a way peculiarly cal|culated for the French &s;tage: the re&s;olution of Henry was too &s;udden, too unprepared, as well as the circum&s;tance of the mock-wedding that precedes it; and throughout the piece there were a number of cold inani|mating occurrences, that had very little, if any, relation to the main de&s;ign; and, add to this, it was never intended for an Opera, for the author him&s;elf calls it a Comedy, in|ter&s;per&s;ed with Songs.</P>
<P>It was thought, therefore, that if the un|nece&s;&s;ary incidents were expunged, and tho&s;e retained were rendered more probable; if,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
by making an uniform partition between the dialogue and the &s;ongs, it could be brought more to wear the complexion of an Opera, <HI>The De&s;erter</HI> might be entitled to a favour|able reception on the Engli&s;h &s;tage: how far the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions were rea&s;onable, the public (who are the be&s;t judges, and by who&s;e arbitration I &s;hall always be proud to abide) will determine.</P>
<P>With regard to the Mu&s;ic, as I found it a work of great invention, I &s;hould have kept it in its original &s;tate, had it been po&s;|&s;ible; but be&s;ides the exce&s;&s;ive length of the &s;ongs, the continual breaks into recitative, the frequent &s;udden alterations of the &s;tile, and above all, that &s;amene&s;s which &s;o parti|cularly characterizes the French Mu&s;ic, I found it much too grave to &s;tand the lea&s;t chance of &s;ucce&s;s in an after-piece: I, there|fore, &s;elected what I thought the beauties; and what I could not effect by having re|cour&s;e to the original, I have endeavoured to &s;upply my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the French compo&s;er, I think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to declare, that the &s;ongs, beginning "<HI>One conduct's for both love and war;</HI>" "<HI>The nymph who in my bo&s;om reigns;</HI>" "<HI>Mr. Simkin, I'd have you to know;</HI>" and "<HI>The whims of folks in love;</HI>" are wholly my own; and that the fir&s;t air in the piece, and that beginning, "<HI>My life's three parts</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<HI>dimini&s;h'd,</HI>" are by Philidor, a name of no incon&s;iderable note in the mu&s;ical world.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add but that I take this opportunity of making my acknowledgments to the performers for the &s;upport they were of to this piece; I would, indeed, but that I de&s;pair of finding words worthy the occa&s;i|on, expre&s;s my gratitude to the public for their favourable reception of it.</P>
