<HEAD>TO Sir ROGER MOSTYN, Bart. OF MOSTYN, FLINTSHIRE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Gentleman well known to the political world in the begin|ning of the pre&s;ent century made the tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> and before he reached <HI>Abbeville</HI> di&s;covered that in order to &s;ee a country to be&s;t advantage it was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night.</P>
<P>I cannot help making this appli|cable to my&s;elf, who, after publi&s;h|ing three volumes of the <HI>Zoology</HI> of GREAT BRITAIN, found out that to
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
be able to &s;peak with more preci&s;ion of the &s;ubjects I treated of, it was far more prudent to vi&s;it the whole than part of my country: &s;truck therefore with the reflection of hav|ing never &s;een SCOTLAND, I in&s;tantly ordered my baggage to be got ready, and in a rea&s;onable time found my|&s;elf on the banks of the <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I communicated to you my re&s;olution, with your accu&s;tomed friend&s;hip you wi&s;hed to hear from me: I could give but a partial per|formance of my promi&s;e, the atten|tion of a traveller being &s;o much taken up as to leave very little room for the di&s;charge of epi&s;tolary duties; and I flatter my&s;elf you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more &s;atisfactory than the ha&s;ty ac|counts I could &s;end you on my road: but this is far from being the &s;ole motive of this addre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
I have irre&s;i&s;table inducements of public and of a private nature: to you I owe a mo&s;t free enjoyment of the little territories Providence had be&s;towed on me; for by a liberal and equal ce&s;&s;ion of fields, and meads and woods, you connected all the divided parts, and gave a full &s;cope to all my improvements. Every view I take from my window reminds me of my debt, and forbids my &s;ilence, cau&s;ing the plea&s;ing glow of gratitude to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the whole frame, in&s;tead of forcing up the imbittering &s;igh of <HI>Oh! &s;i angulus ille!</HI> Now every &s;cene I enjoy receives new charms, for I mingle with the vi&s;ible beauties, the more plea&s;ing idea of owing them to you, the worthy neighbor and firm friend, who are happy in the calm and dome&s;tic paths of life with abilities &s;uperior to oftentation, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
goodne&s;s content with its own re|ward: with a &s;ound judgement and hone&s;t heart you worthily di&s;charge the &s;enatorial tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, who&s;e unprejudiced vote aids to &s;till the madne&s;s of the People, or aims to check the pre&s;umption of the Mini&s;ter. My happine&s;s in being from your earlie&s;t life your neighbor, makes me confident in my ob&s;erva|tion; your increa&s;ing and di&s;cerning band of friends di&s;covers and con|firms the ju&s;tice of it: may the rea&s;ons that attract and bind us to you ever remain, is the mo&s;t grate|full wi&s;h that can be thought of, by</P>

<HEAD>A TOUR IN SCOTLAND. MDCCLXIX.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th of JUNE take my depar|ture from CHESTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHESTER.</NOTE> a city without parallel for the &s;ingular &s;tructure of the four princi|pal, &s;treets, which are as if excavated out of the earth, and &s;unk many feet beneath the &s;urface; the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens, on a line with ranges of &s;hops, over which on each &s;ide of the &s;treets pa&s;&s;engers walk from end to end, in covered galleries, &s;ecure from wet or heat. The back courts of all the&s;e hou&s;es are level with the ground, but to go into any of the&s;e four &s;treets it is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cend a flight of &s;everal &s;teps.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cathedral</HI> is an antient &s;tructure, very ragged on the out&s;ide, from the nature of the red friable &s;tone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saxum arenarium friabile rubrum <HI>Da Co&s;ta fo&s;&s;ils.</HI> I. 139.</NOTE> with which it is built: the tabernacle work in the choir is very neat; but the beauty, and elegant &s;implicity of a very antique gothic chapter-hou&s;e, is what merits a vi&s;it from every traveller.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hypocau&s;t</HI> near the <HI>Feathers</HI> Inn, is one of the remains of the <HI>Romans</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">This city was the <HI>Deva</HI> and <HI>Devana</HI> of <HI>Antonine,</HI> and the &s;ta|tion of the <HI>Legia vice&s;&s;ima victrix.</HI></NOTE>, it being well known that this place was a principal &s;tation. Among
<PB N="2" REF="9">
many antiquities found here, none is more &s;ingular than the rude &s;culpture of the <HI>Dea Armigera Miner|va,</HI> with her bird and her altar on the face of a rock in a &s;mall field near the <HI>Welch</HI> end of the bridge.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle is a decaying pile. The walk of the city, the only complete &s;pecimens of antient for|tifications, are kept in excellent order, being the principal walk of the inhabitants; the views from the &s;everal parts are very fine; the mountains of <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> the hills of <HI>Broxton,</HI> and the in&s;ulated rock of <HI>Bee&s;ton,</HI> form the ruder part of the &s;cenery; a rich flat forms the &s;ofter view, and the pro&s;pect up the river towards <HI>Boughton,</HI> recalls in &s;ome de|gree the idea of the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> hill.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Tarvin,</HI> a &s;mall village; in the church-yard is an epitaph in memory of Mr. <HI>John Thoma&s;en,</HI> an excellent penman, but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the <HI>Greek</HI> character.</P>
<P><HI>Delamere,</HI> which <HI>Leland</HI> calls a faire and large fore&s;t, with plenty of redde deer and falow, is now a black and dreary wa&s;te; it feeds a few rabbets, and a few black <HI>Terns</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Br. Zool.</HI> II. 430.</NOTE> &s;kim over the &s;pla&s;hes that water &s;ome part of it.</P>
<P>A few miles from this heath lies <HI>Northwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</NOTE> a &s;mall town, long famous for its rock &s;alt, and brine pits; &s;ome years ago I vi&s;ited one of the mines; the &s;tratum of &s;alt lies about forty yards thick; that which I &s;aw was hollowed into the form of a temple; I de&s;cended thro' a dome, and found the roof &s;upported by rows of pillars, about two
<PB N="3" REF="10">
yards thick, and &s;everal in height; the whole was illuminated with numbers of candles, and made a mo&s;t magnificent and glittering appearance. Above the &s;alt is a bed of whiti&s;h clay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Argilla caerula-cinerea <HI>Da Co&s;ta fo&s;&s;ils.</HI> I. 48.</NOTE>, u&s;ed in making the <HI>Liverpool</HI> earthen-ware; and in the &s;ame place is al&s;o dug a good deal of the <HI>Gyp&s;um,</HI> or plai&s;ter &s;tone. The fo&s;&s;il &s;alt is generally yellow, and &s;emi|pellucid, &s;ometimes deba&s;ed with a dull greeni&s;h earth, and is often found, but in &s;mall quantities, quite clear and color-le&s;s.</P>
<P>The road from this place to <HI>Macclesfield</HI> is thro' a flat, rich, but unplea&s;ant country. That town is in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great manufacture of mohair and twi&s;t buttons; has be|tween twenty and thirty &s;ilk mills, and a very con|&s;iderable copper &s;melting hou&s;e, and bra&s;s work.</P>
<P>After leaving this place the country almo&s;t in|&s;tantly changes and becomes very mountanous and barren, at left on the &s;urface; but the bowels com|pen&s;ate for the external &s;terility, by yielding &s;uffi|cient quantity of coal for the u&s;e of the neighboring parts of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and for the burning of lime; va&s;t quantity is made near <HI>Buxton,</HI> and being car|ried to all parts for the purpo&s;es of agriculture, is become a con&s;iderable article of commerce.</P>
<P>The celebrated warm bath of BUXTON <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Romans,</HI> who were remarkably fond of warm baths, did not over-look the&s;e agreeable waters; they had a bath, inclo&s;ed with a brick wall, adjacent to the pre&s;ent St. <HI>Anne</HI>'s well, which Dr. <HI>Short</HI> in his e&s;&s;ay on mineral waters, &s;ays was razed in 1709.</NOTE> is &s;eated in a bottom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUXTON.</NOTE> amid&s;t the&s;e hills, in a mo&s;t chearle&s;s &s;pot, and would be little frequented, did not <HI>Hygeia</HI> often re&s;ide here, and di&s;pen&s;e to her
<PB N="4" REF="11">
votaries the chief ble&s;&s;ings of life, ea&s;e and health with joy and gratitude I this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of the waters; I recollect with rapture the return of &s;pirits, the flight of pain, and re-animation of my long, long crippled rheumatic limbs. But how unfortunate is it, that what Pro|vidence de&s;igned for the general good, &s;hould be rendered only a partial one, and denied to all, ex|cept the opulent or I may &s;ay to the (compara|tively) few that can get admittance into the hou&s;e where the&s;e waters are impri&s;oned. There are other &s;prings (<HI>Cambden</HI> &s;ays nine) very near that in the <HI>Hall,</HI> and in all probability of equal virtue. I was informed that the late Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> not long before his death, had ordered &s;ome of the&s;e to be inclo&s;ed and formed into baths. It is to be hoped that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or will not fail adopting &s;o u&s;efull and humane a plan; that he will form it on the mo&s;t enlarged &s;y&s;tem, that they may open not &s;olely to the&s;e whom mi&s;u&s;ed wealth hath rendered invalids, but to the poor cripple, whom hone&s;t labor hath made a burden to him&s;elf and his country; and to the &s;oldier and &s;ailor, who by hard &s;ervice have lo&s;t the u&s;e ot tho&s;e very limbs which once were active in our defence. The honor re&s;ulting from &s;uch a foundation would be as great, as the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;o benevolent a work would be un&s;peakable; the charms of di&s;&s;ipation would then lo&s;e their force, and dull and ta&s;tele&s;s would every human luxury appear to him who had it in his power thus to lay open the&s;e fountains of health, and to be able to exult in &s;uch pathetic and comfortable &s;trains as the&s;e: <HI>When the ear heard me,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<HI>then it ble&s;&s;ed me, and when the eye &s;aw me it gave witne&s;s to me;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Becau&s;e I delivered the poor that cried, and the fa|therle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon me, and I cau&s;ed the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</HI></P>
<P>After leaving <HI>Buxton,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Middleton</HI> dale, a deep narrow cha&s;m between two va&s;t cliffs, which extend on each &s;ide near a mile in length: this road is very &s;ingular, but the rocks in general are too naked to be beautifull. At the end is the &s;mall village of <HI>Stoney Middleton;</HI> here the pro&s;pect opens, and at <HI>Bar&s;ly Bridge</HI> exhibits a pretty view of a &s;mall but fertile vale, watered by the <HI>Derwent,</HI> and terminated by <HI>Chat&s;worth,</HI> and its plantations. Arrived and lay at</P>
<P><HI>Che&s;terfield;</HI> an ugly town. There is here a great manufacture of wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and another of a brown earthen-ware, much of which is &s;ent into <HI>Holland;</HI> the clay is found near the town, over the ba&s;s or cherry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or flinty.</NOTE> &s;tratum, above, the coal. The &s;teeple of <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> church is a &s;pire, covered with lead, but by a violent wind &s;trangely bent, in which &s;tate it remains.</P>
<P>In the road &s;ide, about three miles from the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">JUNE 27.</NOTE> are &s;everal pits of iron &s;tone, about nine or ten feet deep. The &s;tratum lies above the coal, and is two feet thick. I was informed that the adventurers pay ten pounds per annum to the Lord of the Soil, for liberty of rai&s;ing it; that the la|borers
<PB N="6" REF="13">
borers have &s;ix &s;hillings per load for getting it; each load is about twenty &s;trikes or bu&s;hels, which yields a tun of metal. Coal, in the&s;e parts, is very cheap, a tun and a half being &s;old for five &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Changed hor&s;es at <HI>Work&s;op</HI> and <HI>Tuxford;</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Trent</HI> at <HI>Dunham-Ferry,</HI> where it is broad but &s;hallow; the &s;pring tides flow here, and ri&s;e about two feet, but the common tides never reach this place. Pa&s;s along the <HI>Fo&s;s-Dyke,</HI> or the canal opened by <HI>Henry</HI> I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dugdale</HI> on embanking, 167.</NOTE> to form a communication be|tween the <HI>Trent</HI> and the <HI>Witham;</HI> it was opened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I make u&s;e of this word, as Doctor <HI>Stukely</HI> conjectures this canal to have been originally a <HI>Roman</HI> work; and that another of the &s;ame kind (called the <HI>Cardike</HI>) communicated with it, by means of the <HI>Withan,</HI> which began a little below <HI>Wa&s;henbro',</HI> three miles from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and was continued thro' the fens as far as <HI>Peterborough.</HI> The gentlemen who favored me with the account of the <HI>Cardike,</HI> referred me to <HI>Stukely</HI>'s <HI>Cerau&s;ius,</HI> and his life of <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Ciren|ce&s;ter,</HI> books I have not at pre&s;ent before me.</NOTE> the year 1121, and extends from <HI>Lincoln</HI> to <HI>Tor|ke&s;ey;</HI> its length is eleven miles three quarters, the breadth between dike and dike at the top is about &s;ixty feet, at bottom twenty-two; ve&s;&s;els from fif|teen to thirty-five tuns navigate this canal, and by its means a con&s;iderable trade in coals, timber, corn and wool is carried on. In former times, the per&s;ons who had landed property on either &s;ide were obliged to &s;cower it whenever it was choaked up, and accordingly we find pre&s;entments were made by juries in &s;everal &s;ucceeding reigns for that purpo&s;e. Reach</P>
<P>LINCON, an antient but ill-built city, much fallen away from its former extent. It lies partly on a plain, partly on a very &s;teep hill, on who&s;e &s;ummit are the cathedral and the ruins of the ca&s;tle. The fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="14">
is a va&s;t pile of gothic architecture; has nothing remarkable on the out&s;ide, but within is of match|le&s;s beauty and magnificence: the ornaments are exce&s;&s;ively rich, and in the fine&s;t gothic ta&s;te; the pillars light, the centre lo&s;ty, and of a &s;urpri&s;ing grandeur. The windows at the N. and S. ends very antient, but very elegant; one repre&s;ents a leaf with its fibres, the other con&s;i&s;ts of a number of &s;mall circles. There are two other antient win|dows on each &s;ide the great i&s;le: the others, as I recollect, are modern. This church was, till of late years, much out of repair, but has ju&s;t been re&s;tored in a manner that does credit to the Chapter. There is indeed a &s;ort of arch near the W. end, that &s;eems placed there (for the &s;ame end as <HI>Bayes</HI> tells us he wrote one of his &s;cenes) meerly to &s;et off the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from this eminence is very exten|&s;ive, but very barren of objects, a va&s;t flat as far as the eye can reach, con&s;i&s;ting of plains not the mo&s;t fertile, or of fens <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fens, naked as they now appear, were once well wooded; oaks have been found buried in them, which were &s;ixteen yards long, and five in circumference; fir trees from thirty to thirty-five yards long, and a foot or eighteen inches &s;quare. The&s;e trees had not the mark of the ax, but appeared as if burnt down by fire ap|plied to their lower parts. Acorns and &s;mall nuts have al&s;o been found in great quantities in the &s;ame places. <HI>Dugdale</HI> on embank|ing, 141.</NOTE> and moors: the la&s;t are far le&s;s exten&s;ive than they were, many being drained, and will &s;oon become the be&s;t land in the country. But &s;till much remains to be done; the fens near <HI>Reve&s;by-Abby,</HI> eight miles beyond <HI>Horn|ca&s;tle,</HI> are of va&s;t extent; but &s;erve for little other purpo&s;e than the rearing great numbers of gee&s;e, which are the wealth of the fenmen.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">
During the breeding &s;ea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gee&s;e.</NOTE> the&s;e birds are lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;es with the inhabitants, and even in their very bed-chambers: in every appart|ment are three rows of coar&s;e wicker pens placed one above another; each bird has its &s;eparate lodge divided from the other, which it keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of during the time of &s;itting.

<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t Fen</HI> is quite in a &s;tate of nature, and gives a &s;pecimen of the country before the intro|duction of drainage: it is a va&s;t tract of mora&s;s, intermixed with numbers of lakes, from half a mile to two or three miles in circuit, communicating with each other by narrow reedy &s;traits: they are very &s;hallow, none are above four or five feet in depth; but abound with fi&s;h, &s;uch as Pike, Pearch, Ruff, Bream, Tench, Rud, Dace, Roach, Bur|bolt, Sticklebacks and Eels. The fen is covered with reeds, the harve&s;t of the neighboring inhabi|tants, who mow them annually; for they prove a much better thatch than &s;traw, and not only cot|tages but many very good hou&s;es are covered with them. Stares, which during winter re&s;ort in my|riads to roo&s;t in the reeds, are very de&s;tructive, by breaking them down by the va&s;t numbers that perch on them. The people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive them away, and are at great expence in powder to free them&s;elves from the&s;e trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts.

<P><HI>Scarborough</HI> is &s;ituated at the bottom of a bay, formed by <HI>Whitby</HI> rock on the North, and <HI>Flambo|rough</HI>-head on the South; the town is &s;eated directly oppo&s;ite to the centre of the W. end of the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank; which end, (according to <HI>Hammond</HI>'s chart of the North Sea) lies S. and by W. and N. and by E. but by a line drawn from <HI>Tinmouth</HI> ca&s;tle, would lead about N. W. and S. E. Tho' the <HI>Dog|ger</HI> bank is therefore but 12 leagues from <HI>Flambo|rough</HI>-head, yet it is 16 and a half from <HI>Scarborough,</HI> 23 from <HI>Whitby,</HI> and 36 from <HI>Tinmouth</HI> ca&s;tle. The N. &s;ide of the bank &s;tretches off E. N. E. between 30 and 40 leagues, untill it almo&s;t joins to the <HI>Long-Bank,</HI> and <HI>Jutt</HI>'s Riff.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, that the fi&s;hermen &s;eldom find any Cod, Ling, or other round fi&s;h upon the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank it&s;elf, but on the &s;loping edges and hollows contiguous to it. The top of the bank is covered with a barren &s;hifting &s;and, which affords them no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the water on it, from its &s;hallowne&s;s, is continually &s;o agitated and broken, as to allow them no time to re&s;t. The flat fi&s;h do not &s;uffer the &s;ame inconvenience there; for when di&s;turbed by the motion of the &s;ea, they &s;helter them&s;elves in the &s;and, and find variety of &s;uitable food. It is true, the <HI>Dutch</HI> fi&s;h upon the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank, but it is al&s;o true they take little except Soles, Skates, Thornbacks, Plai&s;e, &amp;c. It is in the hol|lows
<PB N="19" REF="26">
between the <HI>Dogger</HI> and the <HI>Well-Bank,</HI> that the Cod are taken, which &s;upply <HI>London</HI> market.</P>
<P>The &s;hore, except at the entrance of <HI>Scarbo|rough</HI> pier, and &s;ome few other places, is com|po&s;ed of covered rocks, which abound with Lob&s;ters and Crabs, and many other &s;hell fi&s;h, (no Oy&s;ters) thence, after a &s;pace covered with clean &s;and, extending in different places from one to five or &s;ix miles. The bottom, all the way to the edge of the <HI>Dogger</HI> banks, is a &s;car; in &s;ome places very rugged, rocky, and cavernous; in others &s;mooth, and overgrown with variety of &s;ubmarine plants, Mo&s;&s;es, Corallines, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I met with on the &s;hores near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> &s;mall fragments of the true red coral.</NOTE> &s;ome parts again are &s;pread with &s;and and &s;hells; others, for many leagues in length, with &s;oft mud and ooze, furni&s;hed by the di&s;charge of the <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>Upon an attentive review of the whole, it may be clearly inferred, that the &s;hore along the coa&s;t on the one hand, with the edges of the <HI>Dogger</HI> bank on the other, like the &s;ides of a decoy, give a direction towards our fi&s;hing grounds to the mighty &s;hoals of Cod, and other fi&s;h, which are well known to come annually from the Northern ocean into our &s;eas; and &s;econdly, that the great variety of fi&s;hing grounds near <HI>Scarborough,</HI> extending upwards of 16 leagues from the &s;hore, afford &s;ecure retreats and plenty of proper food for all the various kinds of fi&s;h, and al&s;o &s;uitable places for each kind to de|po&s;it their &s;pawn in.</P>

It is then thrown into pits and &s;teeped in water, to ex|tract all the &s;aline particles. The liquor is then run into other pits, where the vitriolic &s;alts are precipitated, by the addition of a &s;olution of the <HI>&s;al &s;ode,</HI> prepared from kelp; or by the volatile <HI>alkali</HI> of &s;tale urine. The &s;uperfluous water being then evaporated duely by boiling in large furnaces, the liquor is &s;et to cool; and la&s;tly, is poured into large ca&s;ks, to cry&s;tallize.</P>
<P>The alum works of this county are of &s;ome an|tiquity; they were fir&s;t di&s;covered by Sir <HI>Thomas Chaloner,</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who ob&s;erving the trees tinged, with an unu&s;ual color, made him &s;u&s;picious of its being owing to &s;ome mineral in the neighborhood. He found out that the &s;trata abounded with an aluminous &s;alt.</P>
<P>At that time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being &s;trangers to the method of managing it, there is a tradition that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was obliged to &s;educe &s;ome workmen from the <HI>Pope</HI>'s alum-works near <HI>Rome,</HI> then the greate&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI> If one may judge from the cur&s;e which his Holine&s;s thundered out again&s;t Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="29">
the &s;ugitives, he certainly was not a little enraged; for he cur&s;ed by the very form that <HI>Ernulphus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy.</HI></NOTE> has left us, and not varied a tittle from that mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ive of imprecations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t pits were near <HI>Gi&s;borough,</HI> the &s;eat of the <HI>Chaloners,</HI> who &s;till flouri&s;h there, notwith&s;tand|ing his Holine&s;s's <HI>anathema.</HI> The works were &s;o valuable as to be deemed a royal mine. Sir <HI>Paul Pindar,</HI> who rented them, payed annually to the King 12,500l. to the Earl of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> 1,640l. to Sir <HI>William Pennyman</HI> 600l. kept 800 workmen in pay, and &s;old his alum at 26l. per tun. But this monopoly was de&s;troyed on the death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. and the right re&s;tored to the proprietors.</P>
<P>In the&s;e alum rocks are frequently found <HI>cornua ammonis,</HI> and other fo&s;&s;ils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jet.</NOTE> lodged in a &s;tony nodule.

<P>WHITBY, called by the <HI>Saxons, Streane&s;halch,</HI> or bay of the light-hou&s;e, a large town, oddly &s;ituated between two hills, with a narrow channel running through the middle, extending about a mile farther up the vale, where it widens, and forms a bay. The two parts of the town are joined by a good draw-bridge, for the conveniency of letting the &s;hipping pa&s;s. From this bridge are often taken the viviparous Blenny, who&s;e back-bone is as green as that of the Sea Needle. The river that forms this harbor is the <HI>E&s;k,</HI> but its waters are very incon&s;iderable when the tide is out. Here is a pretty bri&s;k trade in &s;hip-building; but except that, a &s;mall manufacture of &s;ail-cloth, and the hiring out of &s;hips as at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> like that town it has &s;carce any commerce. It is computed there are about 270 &s;hips belonging to this place. Of late, an attempt has been made to have a &s;hare in the <HI>Greenland</HI> fi&s;hery; four &s;hips were &s;ent out, and had very good &s;ucce&s;s. There are very good dry

<P>On the hill above the S. &s;ide of the town is a fine ruin of St. <HI>Hilda</HI>'s church.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Hilda</HI>'s church.</NOTE> The &s;ite was given to that &s;aint by <HI>O&s;wy,</HI> king of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> about A.

St. <HI>Hilda</HI> founded a convent here for men and wo|men, dedicated it to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and put it under the direction of an abbe&s;s.

<P>Went about two miles along the &s;hore, then turned up into the country, a black and barren moor; ob&s;erved on the right a va&s;t artificial mount, or <HI>Tumulus,</HI> called <HI>Freeburgh</HI> Hill, a monument, in all probability, the work of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who&s;e cu&s;tom it was to fling up &s;uch <HI>Tumuli</HI> over the graves of their kings or leaders; or, in memory of the flain in general, upon the &s;pot where they had obtained any great victory. It is po&s;&s;ible that this mount owed its ri&s;e to the victory gained by <HI>Ivar,</HI> a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> prince, over <HI>Ella,</HI> king of <HI>Bernicia,</HI> who was on his way from the North to &s;uccour <HI>O&s;bert;</HI> for we are told that <HI>Ivar,</HI> after defeating the la&s;t, went from <HI>York</HI> to meet <HI>Ella,</HI> and fought and flew him on his march.</P>

At the end of this moor, about three miles from <HI>Gi&s;borough,</HI> is a beautifull view over the remaining part of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> towards <HI>Durham, Hartlepool,</HI> and the mouth of the <HI>Tees,</HI> which maeanders through a very rich tract. The country in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umes a new face; the road lies between mo&s;t delightfull hills finely wooded, and the little vales between them very fertile: on &s;ome of the hills are the marks of the fir&s;t alum works, which were di&s;covered by Sir <HI>Thomas Chaloner.</HI></P>
<P>GISBOROUGH, a &s;mall town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a vale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GISBOROUGH.</NOTE> &s;urrounded at &s;ome di&s;tance by hills, and open on the ea&s;t to the &s;ea, which is about five miles di&s;tant. It is certainly a delightfull &s;pot, but I cannot &s;ee the rea&s;on why <HI>Cambden</HI> compares it to <HI>Puteoli.</HI> Here was once a priory of the canons of the order of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> founded by <HI>Robert de Brus,</HI> 1129, after the di&s;&s;olution granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to the <HI>Chaloners:</HI> a very beautifull ea&s;t window of the church is &s;till remaining. The town has at pre&s;ent a good manu|facture of &s;ail cloth.</P>
<P>The country continues very fine quite to the banks of the <HI>Tees,</HI> a con&s;iderable river, which di|vides <HI>York&s;hire</HI> from the bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI> After travelling 109 miles in a &s;trait line through the fir&s;t, enter <HI>Durham,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing the river on a very hand&s;ome bridge of arches, the battlements neatly panneled with &s;tone; and reach</P>
<P>STOCKTON, lying on the <HI>Tees</HI> in form of a cre&s;|cent. A hand&s;ome town; the principal &s;treet is remarkably fine, being 165 feet broad; and &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;treets run into it at right angles. In the mid|dle of the great &s;treet are neat &s;hambles, a town|hou&s;e,
<PB N="26" REF="33">
and large a&s;&s;embly-room. There is be&s;ides a large &s;quare. About a century ago, according to <HI>Ander&s;on,</HI> it had &s;carce a hou&s;e that was not made of clay and thatch; but is now a flouri&s;hing place. Its manufacture is &s;ail cloth; and great quantities of corn, and lead, (from the mineral parts of the county) are &s;ent off from hence by commi&s;&s;ion. As the river does not admit of large ve&s;&s;els &s;o high as the town, tho&s;e commodities are &s;ent down to be &s;hipped.</P>
<P>The &s;almon fi&s;hery here is neglected, for none are taken beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the country. Smelts come up the river in the winter time. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the town &s;tood the ca&s;tle; what remained of it is at pre&s;ent converted into a barn. The country from hence to <HI>Durham</HI> is flat, very fertile, and much inclo&s;ed. Towards the we&s;t is a fine view of the highlands of the country: tho&s;e hills are part of that va&s;t ridge which commence in the north and deeply divide this portion of the kingdom; and on that account are called by <HI>Camb|den</HI> the <HI>Appennines</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The approach to DURHAM is romantic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">DURHAM.</NOTE> through a deep hollow, cloathed on each &s;ide with wood. The city is pretty large, but the buildings old. Part are on a plain, part on the &s;ide of a hill. The abby, or cathedral, and the ca&s;tle, where the Bi&s;hop lives when he re&s;ides here, are on the &s;ummit of a cliff, who&s;e foot is wa&s;hed on two &s;ides by the river <HI>Were.</HI> The walks on rhe oppo&s;ite banks are very beautifull, flagged in the middle and paved on the &s;ides, and are well kept. They are cut through
<PB N="27" REF="34">
the wood, impend over the river, and receive a venerable improvement from the ca&s;tle and antient cathedral which &s;oar above.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is very old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Begun in 1093, by Bi&s;hop <HI>William de Carilepho.</HI></NOTE>; plain without, and &s;up|ported within by ma&s;&s;y pillars, deeply engraved with lozenge-like figures, and zigzag furrows: others are plain; and each forms a clu&s;ter of pillars. The &s;kreen to the choir is wood covered with a coar&s;e carving. The choir neat, but without or|nament.</P>
<P>The chapter-hou&s;e &s;eems very antient, and is in the form of a theatre. The cloi&s;ters large and hand&s;ome. All the monuments are defaced, ex|cept that of Bi&s;hop <HI>Hatfield.</HI> The Prebendal hou&s;es are very plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and have a fine view backwards.</P>
<P>There are two hand&s;ome bridges over the <HI>Were</HI> to the walks; and a third covered with hou&s;es, which join the two parts of the town. This river produces Salmon, Trout, Roach, Dace, Minow, Loche, Bullhead, Sticklebacks, Lamprey, the le&s;&s;er Lamprey, Eels, Smelts and Samlet, which are called here <HI>Rack-riders,</HI> becau&s;e they appear in winter, or bad weather; <HI>Rack,</HI> in the northern dia|lect, &s;ignifying the driving of the clouds by tem|pe&s;ts. It is ob&s;erved here, that before they go off to &s;pawn, tho&s;e fi&s;h are covered with a white &s;lime.</P>
<P>There is no incon&s;iderable manufacture, at <HI>Dur|ham,</HI> of &s;halloons, tammies, &s;tripes and callaman|coes. I had heard on my road many complaints of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government this county is &s;ubject

<P>Saw <HI>Coker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 12.</NOTE> the &s;eat of Mr. <HI>Car;</HI> a mo&s;t romantic &s;ituation, layed out with great judgment; the walks are very exten&s;ive, principally along the &s;ides or at the bottom of deep dells, bounded with va&s;t preci|pices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines, which I was told bore well, but late. The river <HI>Were</HI> winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches at the place where you enter the&s;e walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a &s;olid rock. The view towards the ruins of <HI>Finchal</HI>-Abby is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent &s;olemnity, a fit retreat for its mona&s;tic inhabitants. This was once called the De&s;ert, and was the rude &s;cene of the au&s;terities of St. <HI>Godric,</HI> who carried them to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s extravagance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Godric</HI> was born at <HI>Walpole</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and being an itine|rant merchant got acquainted with St. <HI>Cuthbtert</HI> at <HI>Farn I&s;land.</HI> He made three pilgrimages to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> at length, was warned by a vi&s;ion to &s;ettle in the de&s;ert of <HI>Finchal.</HI> He lived a hermetical life there during 63 years, and practi&s;ed unheard of au&s;terities: he wore an iron &s;hirt next his &s;kin, day and night, and wore out three: he mingled a&s;hes with the flower he made his bread of; and, lea&s;t it &s;hould then be too good, kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it. In winter, as well as &s;ummer, he pa&s;&s;ed whole nights, up to his chin in water, at his devotions. Like St. <HI>Antony,</HI> he was often haunted by fiends in various &s;hapes; &s;ometimes in form of beautifull dam&s;els, &s;o was vi&s;ited with evil concupi&s;cence, which he cured by rolling naked among thorns and briars: his body grew ulcerated; but, to encrea&s;e his pain, he poured &s;alt into the wounds.

<P>Pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Che&s;ter-le-Street,</HI> a &s;mall town, near which is <HI>Lumly-Ca&s;tle,</HI> the &s;eat of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough;</HI> a place, as I was told, very well worth &s;eeing; but unfortunately it proved a public day, and I lo&s;t &s;ight of it. The country, from <HI>Durham</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> was very beautifull; the ri&s;ings gentle, and prettily wooded, and the views agreeable; that on the borders remarkably fine, there being, from an eminence not far from the capital of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> an exten&s;ive view of a rich country, watered by the coaly <HI>Tyne.</HI> Reach</P>
<P>NEWCASTLE, a large, di&s;agreeable, and dirty town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEWCASTLE.</NOTE> divided in two unequal parts by the river, and both &s;ides very &s;teep. The lower parts are inhabited by Keelmen and their families, a muti|nous race; for which rea&s;on this town is always garri&s;oned.</P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of the place is the coal trade. The collieries lie at different di&s;tances, from five to eighteen miles from the river; and the coal is brought down in waggons along rail roads, and di&s;charged from covered buildings at the edge of the water into the keels or boats that are to convey it on &s;hipboard. The&s;e boats are &s;trong, clum&s;y and round, will carry about 25 tuns each; &s;ometimes are navigated with a &s;quare &s;ail, but generally are pu&s;hed along with large poles. No &s;hips of large burthen can come up as high as <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> but are obliged to lie at <HI>Shields,</HI> a few miles down the river, where &s;tage coaches go thrice every day for the conveniency of pa&s;&s;engers. This country is mo&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="37">
remarkably populous; <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> alone contains near 40,000 inhabitants; and there are at le&s;t 400 &s;ail of &s;hips belonging to that town and its port. The effect of the va&s;t commerce of this place is very apparent for many miles round; the country is finely cultivated, and bears a mo&s;t thriving and opulent a&s;pect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">JULY 13.</NOTE>Left <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> the country in general flat; pa&s;&s;ed by a large &s;tone column with three dials on the capital, with &s;everal &s;cripture texts on the &s;ides, called here <HI>Pigg</HI>'s Folly, from the founder.</P>
<P>A few miles further is <HI>Stannington</HI> Bridge, a plea|&s;ant village. <HI>Morpeth,</HI> a &s;mall town with a neat town-hou&s;e, and a tower for the bell near it. The ca&s;tle was on a &s;mall eminence, but the remains are now very incon&s;iderable. Some attempt was made a few years ago to introduce the <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> manu|facture, but without &s;ucce&s;s. There is a remarkable &s;tory of this place, that the inhabitants reduced their own town to a&s;hes, on the approach of King <HI>John,</HI> A. D. 1215, out of pure hatred to their mo|narch, in order that he might not find any &s;helter there.</P>
<P>This place gave birth to <HI>William Turner,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, an excellent <HI>Latini&s;t, Graecian, Oratour,</HI> and <HI>Poet;</HI> he might have added polemic divine, champion and &s;ufferer in the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, phy&s;ician and naturali&s;t.

<P>At <HI>Alnwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alnwick</HI> Ca&s;tle.</NOTE></HI> a &s;mall town, the traveller is di&s;ap|pointed with the &s;ituation and environs of the ca&s;tle, the re&s;idence of the <HI>Percies,</HI> the antient Earls of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> You look in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feudal age; for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowe&s;s and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and haberks, or with the &s;poils of the chace; for exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, and venerable oaks. You look in vain for the <HI>helmet</HI> on the tower, the antient &s;ignal of ho&s;pitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train, who&s;e coun|tenances gave welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and in&s;tead of the di&s;intere&s;ted u&s;her of the old times, he is attended by a <HI>valet</HI> eager to receive the fees of admittance.</P>
<P>There is va&s;t grandeur in the appearance of the out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle; the towers magnificent, but injured by the numbers of rude &s;tatues crouded on the battlements. The appartments are large, and lately fini&s;hed in the gothic &s;tyle with a mo&s;t incom|patible elegance. The gardens are equally incon|&s;i&s;tent, trim to the highe&s;t degree, and more adapted
<PB N="32" REF="39">
to a <HI>villa</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> than the antient &s;eat of a great Baron. In a word, nothing, except the num|bers of unindu&s;trious poor that &s;warm at the gate, excites any one idea of its former circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A &s;tage further is <HI>Belford,</HI> the &s;eat of <HI>Abraham Dixon,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a modern hou&s;e; the front has a mo&s;t beautifull &s;implicity in it.

<P>On an eminence on the &s;ea coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bamborough</HI> Ca&s;tle.</NOTE> about four miles from <HI>Belford,</HI> is the very antient ca&s;tle of <HI>Bamborough,</HI> built by <HI>Ida,</HI> fir&s;t king of the <HI>Nor|thumbrians,</HI> A.

The ruins are &s;till con&s;iderable; the remains of a great hall are very &s;ingular; it had been warmed by two fire-places of a va&s;t &s;ize, and from the top of every window ran a flue, like that of a chimney, which reached the &s;ummits of the battlements. Many of the ruins are now filled with &s;and, caught up by the winds that rage here with great impe|tuo&s;ity, and carried to very di&s;tant places.</P>

Three of the&s;e Tru&s;tees are a majority: one of them makes this place his re&s;idence, and ble&s;&s;es the coa&s;t by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's generous beque&s;t. He has repaired and rendered habitable the great &s;quare tower: the part re&s;erved for him&s;elf and family is a large hall and a few &s;maller apartments; but the re&s;t of the &s;pacious edifice is allotted for purpo&s;es which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of. The upper part is an ample grainary; from whence corn is di&s;penced to the poor without di&s;tinction, even in the deare&s;t time, at the rate of four &s;hillings a bu&s;hel; and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for many miles round, often experience the conveniency of this benefaction.</P>
<P>Other apartments are fitted up for the reception of &s;hipwrecked &s;ailors; and bedding is provided for about thirty, &s;hould &s;uch a number happen to be ca&s;t on &s;hore at the &s;ame time. A con&s;tant pa|trole is kept every &s;tormy night along this tem|pe&s;tuous coa&s;t, for above eight miles, the length of the manour, by which means numbers of lives have been pre&s;erved. Many poor wretches are often found on the &s;hore in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; but by timely relief, are &s;oon brought to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It often happens, that &s;hips &s;trike in &s;uch a man|ner on the rocks as to be capable of relief, in ca&s;e numbers of people could be &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled: for that purpo&s;e a cannon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Once belonging to a <HI>Dutch</HI> frigate of 40 guns; which, with all the crew, was lo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the ca&s;tle, about &s;ixty years ago.</NOTE> is fixed on the top of

<P>The flouri&s;hing &s;tate of <HI>Perth</HI> is owing to two accidents: the fir&s;t, that of numbers of <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s wounded officers and &s;oldiers chu&s;ing to re&s;ide here, after he left the kingdom, who introduced a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among the people: the other cau&s;e was the long continuance of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s army here in 1715, which occa&s;ioned va&s;t &s;ums of money being &s;pent in the place: but this town, as well as all <HI>Scotland,</HI> dates its pro&s;perity from the year 1745, the government of this part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> having never been &s;ettled till a little after that time.

<P>From the little traditions, pre&s;erved in the palace, it &s;eems as if <HI>Gowrie</HI> had not the left intent of mur|thering the King: on the day his Maje&s;ty came to <HI>Perth,</HI> the Earl was engaged to a wedding-dinner with the Dean of Guild: when the account of the king's de&s;ign reached him he changed color, on being taken &s;o unprovided; but the Dean forced him to accept the nuptial fea&s;t, which was &s;ent over to the Earl's hou&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Gowrie</HI> was a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed gentleman: after he had fini&s;hed his &s;tudies he held the Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy's chair for two years, in one of the <HI>Italian</HI> univer&s;ities.</P>

<P>The country is good, full of barley, oats, and flax in abundance; but after a few miles travelling, is &s;ucceeded by a black heath: ride through a beau|tifull plantation of pines, and after de&s;cending an ea&s;y &s;lope the plain beneath &s;uddenly contracts it|&s;elf into a narrow glen: the pro&s;pect before me &s;trongly marked the entrance into the <HI>Highlands,</HI> the hills that bounded it on each &s;ide being lofty and rude.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Birnam</HI> Wood.</NOTE> On the left was <HI>Birnam</HI> Wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dun&s;inane</HI></NOTE> which &s;eems never to have recovered the march its an|ce&s;tors made to <HI>Dun&s;inane:</HI> I was &s;hewn at a great di&s;tance a high ridge of hills, where &s;ome remains of that famous fortre&s;s * (<HI>Macbeth</HI>'s ca&s;tle) are &s;aid yet to exi&s;t.</P>

<P>The north &s;ide of <HI>Loch-Tay</HI> is very populous; for in &s;ixteen &s;quare miles are &s;eventeen hundred and eighty-&s;ix &s;ouls: on the other &s;ide, about twelve hundred.

<P>After a &s;mall interval arrive on the banks of <HI>Lough-Lochy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lough-Lochy.</HI></NOTE> a fine piece of water, fourteen miles long, and from one to two broad.

By his influence he prevented the Rebels from committing &s;everal ex|ce&s;&s;es, and even &s;aved the city of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> from being plundered, when their army returned out of <HI>England,</HI> irritated with their di&s;appointment, and enraged at the loyalty that city had &s;hewn.

The&s;e publick works were at fir&s;t very di&s;agreeable to the old Chieftains: it le&s;&s;ened their influence greatly; for by admitting &s;trangers among them their clans were taught that the Lairds were not the fir&s;t of men. But they had another rea&s;on much more &s;olid: <HI>Lochaber</HI> had been a den of thieves; and as long as they had their waters, their torrents and their bogs, in a &s;tate of nature, they made their excur&s;ions, could plunder and retreat with their booty in full &s;ecurity. So weak were the laws in many parts of <HI>North Britain,</HI> till after the late rebellion, that no &s;top could be put to this infamous practice. A contribution, called the <HI>black meal,</HI> was rai&s;ed by &s;everal of the&s;e plundering chieftains over a va&s;t extent of country: whoever payed it had their cattle en&s;ured, but tho&s;e. who dared to refu&s;e were &s;ure to &s;uffer. Many of the&s;e free-booters were wont to in&s;ert an article, by which they were to be relea&s;ed from their agree|ment, in ca&s;e of any civil commotion: thus, at the breaking out of the la&s;t rebellion, a <HI>M'Gregor,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Graham.</HI></NOTE> who had with the &s;tricte&s;t honor (till that event) pre&s;erved his friends cattle, immediately &s;ent them word, that from that time they were out of his protection, and mu&s;t now take care of them&s;elves. <HI>Barri&s;dale</HI> was another of this cla&s;s, chief of a band of robbers, who &s;pread terror over the whole coun|try: but the Highlanders at that time e&s;teemed the open theft of cattle, or the making a <HI>&s;preith</HI> (as

boats, with four men in each, are employed. A chain of nets is u&s;ed (for &s;everal are united) of a hundred fathoms in length.

<P>The courts e&s;tabli&s;hed by law are the four following, <HI>viz.</HI> Church Se&s;|&s;ions, Pre&s;byteries, Provincial Synods, and above all a National or General A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A Church Se&s;&s;ion is compo&s;ed of the Mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h and certain di&s;creet Laymen, who are cho&s;en and ordained for the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline, and are called Elders. The number of the&s;e Elders varies according to the extent of the pari&s;h. Two of them, together with the Mini&s;ter, are nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their holding a legal meeting. The Mini&s;ter always pre&s;ides in the&s;e meetings, and is called Moderator; but has no other authority but what belongs to the <HI>Prae&s;es</HI> of any other court. The
<PB N="224" REF="243">
Church Se&s;&s;ion is appointed for in|&s;pecting the morals of the pari&s;hioners, and managing the funds that are ap|propriated for the maintainance of the poor within their bounds. When a per&s;on is convided of any in&s;tance of immoral conduct, or of what is in|con&s;i&s;tent with his chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, the Church Se&s;&s;ion inflicts &s;ome eccle|&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure, &s;uch as giving him an admonition or rebuke: or if the crime be of a gro&s;s and publick na|ture, they appoint him to profe&s;s his repentance in face of the whole con|gregation, in order to make &s;atisfac|tion for the publick offence. The highe&s;t church cen&s;ure is excommu|nication, which is &s;eldom inflicted but for contumacy, or for &s;ome very atrocious crime ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in. In former times there were cer|tain civil pains and penalties which followed upon a &s;entence of excom|munication,
<PB N="225" REF="244">
but by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;tatute the&s;e are happily aboli&s;hed. The church of <HI>Scotland</HI> addre&s;&s;es its cen|&s;ures only to the con&s;ciences of men; and if they cannot by the methods of per&s;ua&s;ion reclaim offenders, they think it incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of true religion, to have recour&s;e to compul&s;ive methods, &s;uch as tempo|ral pains and penalties.</P>
<P>If the per&s;on thinks him&s;elf ag|grieved by the Church Se&s;&s;ion, it is competent for him to &s;eek redre&s;s, by entering an appeal to the Pre&s;bytery, which is the next &s;uperiour court. In like manner he may appeal from the Pre&s;bytery to the Provincial Synod, and from the Synod to the A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e &s;entence is final in all ecele|&s;ia&s;tical matters.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="245">
A Pre&s;bytery con&s;i&s;ts of the, Mini|&s;ters within a certain di&s;trict, and al&s;o of one ruling Elder from each Church Se&s;&s;ion within the di&s;trict. In &s;ettling the boundaries of a Pre&s;bytery, a re|gard was paid to the &s;ituation of the country. Where the country is po|pulous and champaign, there are in|&s;tances of thirty Mini&s;ters and as many Elders being joined in one Pre&s;|bytery. In mountainous countries where travelling is more difficult, there are only &s;even or eight Mini&s;ters, in &s;ome places fewer, in a Pre&s;bytery. The number of Pre&s;byteries is com|puted to he about &s;eventy. Pre&s;by|teries review the procedure of Church Se&s;&s;ions, and judge in references and appeals that are brought before them. They take trials of candidates for the mini&s;try: and if upon &s;uch trial they had them duly qualified, they licen&s;e
<PB N="227" REF="246">
them to preach, but not to di&s;pen&s;e the &s;acraments. Such licentiates are called Probationers. It is not com|mon for the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to or|dain or confer holy orders on &s;uch li|centiates till they be pre&s;ented to &s;ome vacant kirk, and thereby acquire a right to a benefice.</P>
<P>It is the privilege of Pre&s;byteries to judge their own members, at lea&s;t in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. They may be judged for herefy, that is, for preach|ing or publi&s;hing doctrines that are contrary to the publick &s;tandard im|po&s;ed by Act of Parliament and A&s;|&s;embly; or for any in&s;tance of im|moral conduct, pro&s;ecutions for here&s;y were formerly more frequent than they are at pre&s;ent; but happily a more liberal &s;pirit has gained ground among the Clergy of <HI>Scotland.</HI> They think more freely than they did of
<PB N="228" REF="247">
old, and con&s;equently a &s;pirit of in|quiry and moderation &s;eems to be on the growing hand; &s;o that pro&s;ecu|tions for herefy are become more rare, and are generally looked upon as in|vidious. Some &s;en&s;ible men among the clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> look upon &s;ub|&s;criptions to certain articles and creeds of human compo&s;ition as a grievance, from which they would willingly be delivered.</P>
<P>Pre&s;byteries are more &s;evere in their cen&s;ures upon their own members for any in&s;tance of immoral conduct. If the per&s;on be convicted, they &s;u&s;pend him from the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;te|rial office for a limited time: but if the crime be of a heinous nature, they depo&s;e or deprive him of his cle|rical character; &s;o that he is no lon|ger a mini&s;ter of the church of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> but forfeits his title to his bene|fice,
<PB N="229" REF="248">
and other privileges of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church. However, if the per|&s;on thinks him&s;elf injured by the &s;entence of the Pre&s;bytery, it is law|ful for him to appeal to the Provin|cial Synod, within who&s;e bounds his Pre&s;bytery lies: and from the Synod he may appeal to the National A&s;&s;em|bly. Pre&s;byteries hold their meetings generally every month, except in re|mote countries, and have a power of adjourning them&s;elves to whatever time or place within their di&s;trict they &s;hall think proper. They chu&s;e their own <HI>Prae&s;es</HI> or Moderator, who mu&s;t be a Mini&s;ter of their own Pre&s;bytery. The ruling Elders who &s;it in Pre&s;byteries mu&s;t be changed every half-year, or el&s;e cho&s;en again by their re&s;pective Church Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Provincial Synods are the next &s;upe|riour courts to Pre&s;byteries, and are
<PB N="230" REF="249">
compo&s;ed of the &s;everal Pre&s;byteries within the province and of a ruling Elder from each Church Se&s;&s;ion. The ancient dioce&s;es of the Bi&s;hops are for the mo&s;t part the boundaries of a Synod. Mo&s;t of the Synods in <HI>Scot|land</HI> meet twice every year, in the months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> and at every meeting they chu&s;e their Prae&s;es or Moderator, who mu&s;t be a clergy|man of their own number. They review the procedure of Pre&s;byteries, and judge in appeals, references and complaints, that are brought before them from the inferiour courts. And if a Pre&s;bytery &s;hall be found negli|gent in executing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws again&s;t any of their members, or any other per&s;on within their juri&s;|diction, the Synod can call them to account, and cen&s;ure them as they &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="250">
The General A&s;&s;embly is the &s;u|preme court in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, and from which there lies no appeal. As they have a power of making Jaws and canons, concerning the di&s;cipline and government of the church, and the publick &s;ervice of religion, the King &s;ends always a commi&s;&s;ioner to repre&s;ent his royal per&s;on, that no|thing may be enacted incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of the &s;tate. The per&s;on who repre&s;ents the King is gene|rally &s;ome <HI>Scots</HI> nobleman, whom his Maje&s;ty nominates annually &s;ome time before the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, and is allowed a &s;uitable &s;alary for de|fraying the expence of this honourable office. He is pre&s;ent at all the meet|ings of the a&s;&s;embly, and at all their debates and deliberations. After the a&s;&s;embly is con&s;tituted, he pre&s;ents his commi&s;&s;ion and delivers a &s;peech;
<PB N="232" REF="251">
and when they have fini&s;hed their bu|&s;ine&s;s, which they commonly do in twelve days, he adjourns the a&s;&s;embly, and appoints the time and place of their next annual meeting, which is generally at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly is compo&s;ed of Mini&s;ters and ruling Elders cho&s;en an|nually from each Pre&s;bytery in <HI>Scot|land.</HI> As the number of Mini&s;ters and Elders in a Pre&s;bytery varies, &s;o the number of their repre&s;entatives mu&s;t hold a proportion to the number of Mini&s;ters and Elders that are in the Pre&s;bytery. The proportion is fixed by laws and regulations for that pur|po&s;e. Each Royal Burgh and Uni|ver&s;ity in <HI>Scotland</HI> has likewi&s;e the privilege of chu&s;ing a ruling Elder to the A&s;&s;embly. All elections mu&s;t at lea&s;t be made forty days before the
<PB N="233" REF="252">
meeting of the A&s;&s;embly. Their ju|ri&s;diction is either con&s;titutive or ju|dicial. By the fir&s;t they have autho|rity to make laws in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters: by the other they judge in references and appeals brought be|fore them from the &s;ubordinate courts, and their &s;entences are deci&s;ive and final. One point which greatly employs their attention is the &s;ettle|ment of vacant pari&s;hes. The com|mon people of <HI>Scotland</HI> are greatly prejudiced again&s;t the law of pa|tronage. Hence when a patron pre|&s;ents a candidate to a vacant pari&s;h, the pari&s;hioners frequently make great oppo&s;ition to the &s;ettlement of the pre&s;entee, and appeal from the infe|riour courts to the A&s;&s;embly. The A&s;&s;embly now-a-days are not di&s;po&s;ed to indulge the pari&s;hioners in unrea|&s;onable oppo&s;ition to pre&s;entees. On the other hand, they are unwilling to
<PB N="234" REF="253">
&s;ettle the pre&s;entee in oppo&s;ition to the whole people, who refu&s;e to &s;ub|mit to his mini&s;try, becau&s;e in this ca&s;e his mini&s;trations among them mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s and without effect. The A&s;&s;embly therefore for the mo&s;t part delay giving &s;entence in &s;uch ca&s;es, till once they have u&s;ed their endea|vours to reconcile the pari&s;hioners to the pre&s;entee. But if their attempts this way prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, they pro|ceed to &s;ettle the pre&s;entee in obe|dience to the act of parliament con|cerning patronages. Upon the whole it appears that in the indicatories of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> there is an equal repre&s;entation of the Laity as of the Clergy, which is a great &s;ecu|rity to the Laity again&s;t the u&s;urpa|tions of the Clergy.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of every Mini&s;ter in a pari&s;h is to perform religious wor&s;hip,
<PB N="235" REF="254">
and to preach in the language of the country to his congregation every <HI>Sunday,</HI> and likewi&s;e on other extra|ordinary occa&s;ions appointed by the laws and regulations of the church. The tendency of their preaching is to in&s;truct their hearers in the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of natural and revealed re|ligion, and improve the&s;e in&s;tructions in order to promote the practice of piety and &s;ocial virtue. Of old, it was cu&s;tomary to preach upon con|troverted and my&s;terious points of divinity, but it is now hoped that the generality of the Clergy confine the &s;ubject of their preaching to what has a tendency to promote virtue and good morals, and to make the people peaceable and u&s;eful members of &s;o|ciety.</P>

the&s;e vi&s;itations the Mini&s;ter incul|cates the practice of the relative and &s;ocial duties, and in&s;i&s;ts upon the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the practice of them. And if there happen to be any quarrels among neighbours, the Mini&s;ter en|deavours by the power of per&s;ua&s;ion to bring about a reconciliation.

<P>To this &s;en&s;ible account of the Church of <HI>North Britain,</HI> I beg leave to add another, which may be con&s;i|dered as a &s;ort of &s;upplement, and may &s;erve to &s;ling light on &s;ome points untouched in the preceding: it is the extract from an an&s;wer to &s;ome que|ries I &s;ent a worthy corre&s;pondent in
<PB N="238" REF="257">
the Highlands, to whom I am in|debted for many &s;en&s;ible communi|cations:</P>
<P><Q>To apprehend well the pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>our</HI> church patronage and mode of &s;ettlement, we mu&s;t briefly view this matter from the Reformation. At <HI>that</HI> remarkable period the whole temporalities of the church were re&s;umed by the Crown and Parliament; and &s;oon after a new maintenance was &s;ettled for Mini&s;ters in about 960 pari&s;hes. The patrons of the old, &s;plendid Popi&s;h livings, &s;till claimed a pa|tronage in the new-modelled poor &s;tipends for pari&s;h mini&s;ters. The Lords, or Gentlemen, who got from the Crown, grants of the &s;uperiorities and lands of old <HI>abbies,</HI> claimed al&s;o the patronage of all the churches which were in the gift of tho&s;e
<PB N="239" REF="258">
<HI>abbies</HI> during popery. The <HI>King</HI> too claimed the old patronage of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and tho&s;e of any <HI>ec|cle&s;ia&s;lic corporations</HI> not granted away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lay-patronages were reckoned always a great grievance by the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and accord|ingly from the beginning of the reformation the Church declared again&s;t lay-patronage and pre&s;en|tations. The eccle&s;ia&s;tic laws, of acts of a&s;&s;embly, confirmed at la&s;t by parliament, required, in order to the &s;ettlement of a Mini&s;ter, &s;ome concurrence of the congre|gation, of the gentlemen who had property within the cure, and of the elders of the pari&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Elders, or <HI>Kirk</HI>-Se&s;&s;ion, are a number of per&s;ons, who, for their
<PB N="240" REF="259">
wi&s;dom, piety and knowledge, are elected from the body of the people in every pari&s;h, and continue for life, <HI>&s;e&s;e bene gerentibus,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pari&s;h Mini&s;ter in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing immoralities and regulating the af|fairs of the pari&s;h. Three of the&s;e men and a Mini&s;ter make a quo|rum, and form the lowe&s;t of our church courts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus matters continued to the year 1649, when by act of parlia|ment patronages were <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> en|tirely, and the election or nomina|tion of Mini&s;ters was committed to the <HI>Kirk</HI>-Se&s;&s;ion or Elders; who, in tho&s;e days of univer&s;al &s;obriety and outward appearance at lea&s;t of religion among the Pre&s;byteriaris, were generally the gentlemen of il be&s;t condition in the pari&s;h who were in communion with the
<PB N="241" REF="260">
church. After the <HI>re&s;toration</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. along with epi&s;|copacy patronages returned, yet under the old laws; and all de|bates were finally determinate by the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> which even under epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland</HI> was the &s;upreme eccle&s;ia&s;tic court. Thus they continued till the Re|volution, when the Pre&s;byterian model was re&s;tored by act of par|liament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The people cho&s;e their own mi|ni&s;ters, and matters continued in this form till the year 1711, when Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s mini&s;try intending to defeat the <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;on, took all methods to hara&s;s &s;uch as were firmly attached to it, which the Pre&s;byterian Gentry and Clergy ever were, both from principle and inte|re&s;t. An act therefore was obtained,
<PB N="242" REF="261">
and which is &s;till in force, re&s;toring patrons to their power of electing mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By this act the King is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the patronage of above 500 churches out of 950, having not only the old rights of the crown, but many patronages ac|quired at the reformation not yet alienated; all the patronages of the 14 <HI>Scots</HI> Bi&s;hops, and all the patronages of the Lords and Gen|tlemen for&s;eited in the years 1715 and 1745. Lords, gentlemen and magi&s;trates of burroughs, are the patrons of the remaining churches. A patron mu&s;t pre&s;ent a qualified per&s;on to a charge within &s;ix months of the la&s;t incumbent's re|moval or death, otherwi&s;e his right falls to the Pre&s;bytery.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="262">
<Q>A Pre&s;bytery con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Mini&s;ters and Elders, All pari&s;hes are annexed to &s;ome Pre&s;bytery. The Pre&s;bytery is the &s;econd church court, and they revi&s;e the the acts of the <HI>Kirk</HI>-Se&s;&s;ion, which is the lowe&s;t. Above the Pre&s;by|tery is the Synod, which is a court con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Pre&s;byteries. And from all the&s;e there lies an appeal to the General A&s;&s;embly, which is the &s;upreme church court in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This &s;upreme court con&s;i&s;ts of the King repre&s;ented by his Commi&s;&s;ioner, Mini&s;ters from the different Pre&s;byteries, and ruling Elders.

Appeal indeed lies, as I &s;aid before, from the deci&s;ion of the inferior to the &s;upreme court.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Great care is taken in preparing young men for the mini&s;try.

Hebrew, and Rhetoric cla&s;&s;es; and before ever they are admitted to tryals for the mini&s;try before a Pre&s;|bytery, they mu&s;t lay te&s;timonials from the different profe&s;&s;ors of their mortis, their attendance, their pro|gre&s;s, before them: and if upon tryal they are found unqualified, they are either &s;et a&s;ide as unfit for the office, or enjoined to apply to their &s;tudies a year or two more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our livings are in general from 60 to 120l. &s;terling. Some few livings are richer, and a few poorer.

<P>Some time after her fever her jaws fell, her eye-lids clo&s;ed, and &s;he lo&s;t her appetite. Her parents declare that for the &s;pace of a year and three-quarters they could not &s;ay that any meat or liquid went down her throat.

throat. Being interrogated on this point, they own'd they very fre|quently put &s;omething into her mouth. But they concluded that nothing went down her throat, becau&s;e &s;he had no evacuation; and when they forced open her jaws at one time, and kept them open for &s;ome time by putting in a &s;tick between her teeth, and pulled forward her tongue, and forced &s;omething down her throat, me coughed and &s;trained, as if in danger to be choaked. One thing during the time &s;he eat and drank nothing is remarkable, that her jaws were unlocked, and &s;he recovered her &s;peech, and retained it for &s;everal days, without any apparent cau&s;e for the &s;ame; &s;he was quite &s;en&s;ible, re|peated &s;everal que&s;tions of the &s;horter catechi&s;ms; told them that it was to no purpo&s;e to put any thing into her mouth, for that nothing went down

her throat; as al&s;o that &s;ometimes &s;he under&s;tood them when they &s;poke to her. By degrees her jaws thereafter fell, and &s;he lo&s;t her &s;peech.</P>
<P>Some time before I few her &s;he re|ceived &s;ome &s;u&s;tenance, whey, water|gruel, &amp;c. but threw it up, at lea&s;t for the mo&s;t part, immediately. When they put the &s;tick between her teeth, mentioned above, two or three of her teeth were broken. It was at this breach they put in any thing into her mouth. I cau&s;ed them to bring her out of bed, and give her &s;omething to drink. They gave her whey. Her neck was contraded, her chin fixed on her brea&s;t, nor could by any force be pulled back: &s;he put her chin and mouth into the di&s;h with the whey, and I perceived &s;he &s;ucked it at the above-mentioned breach as a child would &s;uck the brea&s;t, and imme|diately

threw it up again, as her pa|rents told me &s;he u&s;ed to do, and &s;he endeavoured with her hand to dry her mouth and chin. Her forehead was contracted and wrinkled; her cheeks full, red, and blooming. Her parents told me that &s;he &s;lept a great deal and &s;oundly, per&s;pired &s;ometimes, and now and then emitted pretty large quantities of blood at her mouth.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER III. Parallel Roads in <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the de&s;cription that can be given of the Parallel Roads, or Terra&s;&s;es, is, that the Glen of it&s;elf is extremely narrow, and the hills on each &s;ide very high, and generally not rocky. In the face of the&s;e hills, both &s;ides of the glen, there are three roads at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, and directly oppo&s;ite on each &s;ide. The&s;e roads have been mea|&s;ured in the compleate&s;t parts of them, and found to be 26 paces of a man five feet ten inches high. The two highe&s;t are pretty near each other, about 50 yards, and the lowe&s;t double that di&s;tance from the neare&s;t to it. They are carried along the &s;ides of the glen with the utmo&s;t regularity,
<PB N="254" REF="273">
nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compa&s;s.</P>
<P>Where deep burns or gullies of wa|ter cro&s;s the&s;e roads, they avoid both the de&s;cent and a&s;cent in a very cu|rious manner; &s;o that on the &s;ide where the road enters tho&s;e hollows, they rather a&s;cend along the &s;lope, and de&s;cend the oppo&s;ite &s;ide until they come to the level, without the traveller being &s;en&s;ible of a&s;cent or de&s;cent. There are other &s;maller glens falling into this <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI> The parallel roads &s;urround all the&s;e &s;maller ones; but where <HI>Glen-Roy</HI> ends in the open country there are not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tiges of them to be &s;een. The length of the&s;e roads in <HI>Glen-Roy</HI> are about &s;even miles. There are other two glens in that neighbour|hood where the&s;e roads are equally vi&s;ible, called <HI>Glen-Gluy</HI> and <HI>Glen-Spean,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="274">
the former running north-we&s;t and the latter &s;outh from <HI>Glen-Roy,</HI> Both the&s;e roads are much about the &s;ame length as <HI>Glen-Roy.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the&s;e roads are not cau&s;eway, but levelled out of the earth. There are &s;ome &s;mall rocks, though few, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e roads. People have examined in what manner they made this pa&s;&s;age through the rocks, and find no ve&s;tige of roads in the rock; but they begin on each &s;ide, and keep the regular line as formerly. So far I am indebted to Mr. <HI>Trapaud,</HI> Governor of <HI>Fort Au|gu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot learn to what nation the inhabitants of the country attribute the&s;e roads: I was informed that they were inacce&s;&s;ible at the ea&s;t end, open at the we&s;t, or that neare&s;t to the &s;ea,
<PB N="256" REF="275">
and that there were no traces of build|ings, or <HI>druidical</HI> remains, in any part, that could lead us to &s;u&s;pect that they were de&s;igned for oeconomi|cal or religious purpo&s;es. The coun|try people think they were de&s;igned for the chace, and that the&s;e terra&s;&s;es were made after the &s;pots were cleared in lines from wood, in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed, in order that they might come within reach of the bow|men, who might conceal them&s;elves in the woods above and below. Ridings for the &s;port&s;men are &s;till common in all great fore&s;ts in <HI>France,</HI> and other countries on the continent, either that they might pur&s;ue the game without interruption of trees, or &s;hoot at it in its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> p. 114, of his Itine|rary, mentions &s;uch terra&s;&s;es, to the
<PB N="257" REF="276">
number of &s;eventeen or eighteen, rai&s;ed one above the other in the mo&s;t regu|lar manner, for the &s;pace of a mile, on the &s;ide of a hill, in the county of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> near a village called <HI>Romana,</HI> and al&s;o near two &s;mall <HI>Roman</HI> camps. They are from fifteen to twenty feet broad, and appear at four or five miles di&s;tance not unlike a great am|phitheatre. The &s;ame gentleman al&s;o has ob&s;erved &s;imilar terra&s;&s;es near other camps of the &s;ame nation, from whence he &s;u&s;pects them to be works of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to have been thrown up by their armies for itinerary en|campments. Such may have been their u&s;e in tho&s;e places: but what could have been the object of the contrivers of the terra&s;&s;es of <HI>Glen-Roy,</HI> where it is more than probable tho&s;e conquerors never came, remains a my&s;tery, except the conjecture above given &s;hould prove &s;atisfactory.</P>

The fir&s;t is certainly a mo&s;t authentic repre&s;entation of them; the la&s;t varies in many particulars from the form they now appear in: in that
<PB N="268" REF="287">
the columns are drawn entirely &s;quare from top to bottom, whereas the lower part of the pillars now extant are rounded. There is no fret-work on the old drawing of the&s;e columns, but in&s;tead are two &s;mall rude figures of human heads. The thin &s;emicircular &s;tones are deeply and regularly in|dented on their edges, which appear of an equal thickne&s;s throughout; whereas the others are very &s;harp, or ridged at one extremity, and dilate gradually till they arrive at a con&s;i|derable thickne&s;s at the other. The figures in the old &s;ketch are of a boar, and perhaps a bear. The upper ends of the&s;e pillars &s;eem faithfully to &s;up|ply what has been de&s;troyed, a cro&s;s and a capital.</P>

not appear that there ever were any others in the place. Time has obli|terated the figures of the animals but whether any workman had chiz|zled the whole &s;hafts of the pillars to their pre&s;ent form, is, I think, &s;carcely to be conjectured; they bear all the appearance of antiquity.

Notwith&s;tanding my doubts about the entire fidelity of the old drawing, (which was done about the year 1690) I cau&s;e it to be engraven as a com|panion to the other, in hopes that &s;ome antiquarian of the country will oblige the Publick by clearing up the point.</P>
