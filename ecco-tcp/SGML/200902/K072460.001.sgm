<HEAD>PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR,</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Ta&s;k of writing to improve the Minds of Children may be le&s;s productive of literary Fame than many other Studies, yet in its real Importance and Utility, it yields to none, even of the &s;ublime&s;t Speculations. To impre&s;s the Infant Mind with a Love of Decency and Virtue, to fortify it again&s;t the Influence of Prejudice and Corruption, and at once to gratify the Curio&s;ity and improve the Rea&s;on, is an Undertaking which would not di&s;grace the mo&s;t enlightened Under&s;tanding. If the Eye of the Philo&s;opher can be gratified in merely tracing the Progre&s;s of organized Bodies, from their earlie&s;t Pe|riods of Exi&s;tence, to perfect Maturity, how much greater mu&s;t be the Plea&s;ure of con&s;idering the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Development of the noble&s;t Work of Provi|dence, the human Mind! A common Eye, indeed, may view with Indifference the Sports and Agitations of Children; their Joys, their Griefs, their Pa&s;&s;ions and their Hopes, may appear too trivial to engage its Attention; not &s;o the Man who&s;e Feeling renders him alive to all the Intere&s;ts of the Species, who&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="5">Penetration enables him to fore&s;ee the mighty Revolu|tions which may be produced by the Virtues or Vices of an Individual. It was thus the philo&s;ophic Eye remarked in the youthful Alexander that va&s;t Ambition which was to ravage the Globe, and change the Fate of Nations; it was thus that Popedius Silo di&s;covered in the Infant Cato that &s;tubborn and inflexible Virtue, which &s;o long oppo&s;ed the Tide of Cae&s;ar's Fortune, and &s;upported the dying Liberties of Rome.</P>
<P>But if the &s;imple Con&s;ideration of future Greatne&s;s or di&s;tingui&s;hed Virtue be thus agreeable to a cultiva|ted Mind, how much more intere&s;ting mu&s;t be the Spectacle, when we con&s;ider our&s;elves as con&s;tituting no trifling Part of the future Drama. In this Light may every Man ju&s;tly con&s;ider him&s;elf, who devotes his Talents and his A&s;&s;iduity to the Service of the ri&s;ing generation. How truly noble are tho&s;e Exer|tions which are thus directed to the Service of human Nature, in the Di&s;charge of the mo&s;t important, though la&s;t attractive Duties; and which neglecting Fame, can offer up Ambition it&s;elf, a voluntary Sa|crifice to the Intere&s;t of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Author of the pre&s;ent Work may de&s;ervedly rank among the foremo&s;t of this de&s;erving Cla&s;s. His Merit as a Writer is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Con|tinent, and even in our own Country, that it is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to &s;ay any Thing upon the Subject. His ea&s;y and elegant Pen &s;eems to be particularly adapted to de&s;cribe Nature in its mo&s;t beautiful Forms. The lively Pa&s;&s;ions, the volatile Ta&s;tes, the glowing Co|lours, and the &s;portive Graces of blooming Infancy,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">are all at his Command. But here, for once, the Copy may be allowed to exceed the Original. His elegant Pencil &s;eems to have given a Con&s;i&s;tency and Perma|nency which Nature had denied. Under &s;uch a Ma&s;ter nothing is cold or inanimate; the very Caprices and Levities of Infancy become intere&s;ting Scenes, which gradually warm the Heart, and captivate the Attention. The lighter and more &s;portive Parts of his Work, ex|hibit all the opening Graces of the young Thalia; while Melpomene her&s;elf blu&s;hes with A&s;toni&s;hment to find the variable Pa&s;&s;ions and &s;hort-lived Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of an Infant Theatre &s;o nearly re&s;emble her own.</P>
<P>We flatter our&s;elves, therefore, that we &s;hall offer to unacceptable Pre&s;ent to the Public, in giving a com|plete Tran&s;lation of all the Works of the admired M. BERQUIN. As to the Accuracy of the Tran&s;lation, it becomes us to be &s;ilent; nor do we pretend to any higher Merit than that of being faithful Imitators of a great Original. It will be a &s;ufficient Reward for all our Labours, if they tend to naturalize &s;o excellent a Work in our own Country; and if we can flatter our&s;elves with having thus contributed to form the Hearts, and improve the Under&s;tandings, of the ri&s;ing Generation.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Work has a double Object in view, to amu&s;e Children, and at the &s;ame Time to incline them naturally to Virtue, by always pre&s;enting it to them under the mo&s;t amiable Form. In&s;tead of tho&s;e extravagant Fictions, tho&s;e romantic and marvellous Tales, which have &s;o long contributed to lead the Imaginations of Children a&s;tray, we here exhibit to them only &s;uch Adventures as they may be Witne&s;&s;es to in private Life every Day. The Senti|ments with which the Author endeavours to in&s;pire them are not above their Capacities, and he repre&s;ents them accompanied only by their Equals, their Parents, their Play-fellows, the Servants who are always about them, and the Animals familiar to their View. They expre&s;s them&s;elves in their own native Simplicity of Language, and in Proportion as they are affected by the Incidents de&s;cribed, they indulge the free Move|ment of their little Pa&s;&s;ions. Their Puni&s;hments are made the Con&s;equences of their own proper Faults, and their Rewards con&s;i&s;t in the Plea&s;ure which they derive from their good Actions. Every Thing here di&s;po&s;es
<PB N="viii" REF="8">them to love Virtue for the Sake of their own Happi|ne&s;s, and to deter them from Vice as from a Source of Sorrows and Mortification.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, needle&s;s to remark, that this Work is equally calculated for Children of either Sex. The Difference of their Ta&s;tes and Characters is not yet at their Age &s;ufficiently &s;trong to require to be differently delineated. Be&s;ides, Care has been taken to bring Children of both Sexes together as often as po&s;&s;ible, in order to produce that Union and Intimacy which we are &s;o plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Brothers and Si&s;|ters.</P>
<P>The Author has endeavoured to introduce a Variety in the different Pieces which compo&s;e each Volume. There is not one of them, the Effect of which has not previou&s;ly been tried on Children more or le&s;s advanced in Age and Under&s;tanding, and every Thing has been retrenched that did not &s;eem &s;ufficiently to intere&s;t their Feelings. Each Volume of this Work will contain little Dramas, in which Children, are the principal Characters, in order that they may early learn to acquire a free unembarra&s;&s;ed Countenance, a Gracefulne&s;s of Attitude and Deportment, and an ea&s;y Manner of de|livering them&s;elves before Company. Be&s;ides, the Performance of the&s;e Dramas will be a dome&s;tic Recre|ation and Amu&s;ement. The Parents having always &s;ome Part to perform in them, will ta&s;te the plea&s;ing Delight of partaking in the Diver&s;ions of their young Family; and from the Gratitude of the latter, and the Satisfaction of the Parent, both will be mutually
<PB N="ix" REF="9">attached to each other by a Bond of additional Tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Independent of the moral Utility of this Work, with Re&s;pect to Children, it is obvious that there cannot be a more proper one to in&s;truct them early in delivering their native Language with Ea&s;e and Propriety. The greater Part of tho&s;e Books which are fir&s;t put into their Hands, are either above their Comprehen&s;ion, or totally remote from their Ideas and Sentiments. All the Objects, on the contrary, here held up to their View, being of a Nature &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to excite their Curio&s;ity, they will of cour&s;e take Plea&s;ure in the ea&s;y Study of a Work, which may render them familiar to the innocent Turn of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion adapted to their Age, and applied to de&s;cribe their Amu&s;ements, their Pur&s;uits, and their Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>

<HEAD>THE LITTLE BROTHER.</HEAD>
<P>FANNY aro&s;e one morning very early, intending to go and gather &s;ome flowers in the garden, and to make a no&s;egay of them to carry to her mama, who was then in bed. As &s;he was ju&s;t preparing to go down &s;tairs, Mr. Gla&s;sford her father entered her chamber &s;miling, and took her up in his arms, &s;aying, "Good morning, my dear Fanny! come along with me directly; I am going to &s;hew you &s;omething which you will cer|tainly be very glad to &s;ee." Fanny eagerly a&s;ked, "What is it, papa?" "God has given you a little brother la&s;t night," an&s;wered he. "A little brother? Ah! where is he? Let me &s;ee him! Pray carry me to him directly!" Her father opened the door of the chamber in which her mother lay. There was be&s;ide the bed a &s;trange woman whom Fanny had never before &s;een in the hou&s;e, and who was wrapping up the new-born infant in its &s;wathes. Fanny a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions, to which her father an&s;wered as well as he was able; and thought he had &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity in every thing, when &s;he &s;aid to him, "Papa, who is that old woman? how &s;he binds my little brother up! Are not you afraid that &s;he will hurt him?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no; never fear. It is an hone&s;t woman that I have &s;ent for to take care of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he belongs to mama. Has &s;he &s;een him yet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(drawing back the curtain of her bed.)</STAGE> Yes, Fanny, I have &s;een him. Tell me, are not you glad to &s;ee him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, indeed I am, mama. You have given me a very pretty young companion! what a cunning little face he has! and all red, as if he had ju&s;t been running. Papa, will you let him play with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not po&s;&s;ible, my dear, he cannot &s;tand upon his little legs. You &s;ee how weak they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear! the little legs! I &s;ee it will be a long time before we &s;hall run about together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>All in good time. He mu&s;t fir&s;t learn to walk; and then you will &s;oon be able to play and jump together in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we? O my poor little fellow! I mu&s;t give you &s;omething to make you fond of me. Hold; I have a little picture in my pocket. There, take that. What is the matter, papa? the little monkey will not have it. He holds his little fi&s;ts &s;hut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does not know how to u&s;e them yet. We mu&s;t wait a few months.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that the ca&s;e? aha! my little man, I will give you all my play-things. Well! are you glad of that? an&s;wer me. He &s;eems to &s;mile. Call me Fanny! What, wont you &s;peak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not be able to &s;peak the&s;e two years. But Fanny, take care that you do not di&s;turb your mama with too much talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, look there, his face is quite changed; &s;ee, he cries; certainly it is becau&s;e he is hungry. Be quiet then, my little man, and I will go get you &s;omething nice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not trouble your&s;elf, my dear, about his victuals. He has no teeth yet. How &s;hould he be able to eat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot he eat? What will he live upon then? Mu&s;t he die?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my child. God has given me milk in my brea&s;t for the nouri&s;hment of thy little brother. He is very weak as yet; but after &s;ome time you &s;hall &s;ee how he will tumble about on the floor, like a little lamb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>How I long to &s;ee that! But only look what a pretty tiny head! I dare not touch it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may touch it; but very gently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! quite gently. Oh dear! how &s;oft it is! like a ball of cotton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every little child has &s;uch a head as your bro|ther.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was to fall he would break it all to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. But we will take good care to hold him, &s;o that he &s;hall not fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know, Fanny, that five years ago you were as little as he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>As little as he! Oh, papa, you are joking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear; nothing is more true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I do not remember it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I believe. Do you remember when I had this carpet put on the floor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it has always been as it is now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. I had this carpet laid down at the very time when you were as little as your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! then I never took notice of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Little babies never take notice of what pa&s;&s;es where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are. When your brother &s;hall be as old as you, a&s;k him if he remembers that you tried this day to make him learn to pronounce your name. You will then &s;ee if he recollects it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and did I &s;uck at mama's brea&s;t too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. If you knew all the pains that &s;he has taken for you! In the fir&s;t place you were &s;o weak that you could &s;carce take any nouri&s;hment. We were afraid every moment that you would die before our faces. Your mother u&s;ed to &s;ay, My poor infant! if &s;he &s;hould fall into a fit! and believe me &s;he took infinite pains to get you to &s;uck a few drops of milk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, dear mama! it was you then that taught me to feed my&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my child. Then after your mother had &s;ucceeded in making you take to the brea&s;t of your&s;elf, you grew fat and good-humoured. Such were her cares for near two years, every day and every hour of the day. Sometimes, when your mother was fallen a&s;leep merely through fatigue, you would di&s;turb her re&s;t by your cries. Then would &s;he be obliged to ri&s;e and run to your cradle. My dear Fanny, would &s;he &s;ay, while &s;he endeavoured to
<PB N="4" REF="15">quiet you, &s;urely thou mu&s;t be thir&s;ty, and then &s;he would take you to her brea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was my head at that time as &s;oft as my brother's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;t the &s;ame, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mine! that is &s;o hard now? Oh dear, I mu&s;t have broken it a thou&s;and times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! child; we took &s;o much care of you. Your mother for a time renounced every plea&s;ure, and kept from all company, on purpo&s;e not to lo&s;e you a mo|ment from her &s;ight. As often as bu&s;ine&s;s, that was ab&s;o|lutely indi&s;pen&s;able, obliged her to go out, &s;he was in con|tinual apprehen&s;ion for you. My dear Grace, &s;he would &s;ay to your nur&s;e, I give Fanny into your care, to look to her as if it were your own child; and &s;he was continually making the good woman pre&s;ents, to induce her to take more particular care of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear good mama!&mdash;But was there ever a time, papa, when I could not run? I that can run &s;o well now. See; in three or four &s;teps I am acro&s;s the room. Who was it that taught me this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy mother and I. We put a bandage of vel|vet well &s;tuffed about your head, that if you happened to fall you might not hurt your&s;elf. We then held you by leading-&s;trings to a&s;&s;i&s;t your fir&s;t attempts in walking, and every day we went into the garden upon the gra&s;s-plat, where placing our&s;elves oppo&s;ite to each other, at a little di&s;tance, we &s;et you down betwixt us, &s;tanding all alone, and held out our arms to invite you to come &s;ometimes to one, &s;ometimes to the other. Your &s;lighte&s;t &s;tumble would make our blood run cold. It was by often repeat|ing the&s;e trials that we taught you to walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could never have thought that I gave you &s;o much trouble. Was it you too that taught me to &s;peak?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for that again you are indebted to us. I u&s;ed to take you upon my knees, and repeat to you the words papa and mama, until you were able to li&s;p them to me again. Every word that you can &s;peak this day we taught you in the &s;ame manner. I dare &s;ay you can re|collect that it was we al&s;o who &s;hewed you how to read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>AH! if it would always continue to be winter! &s;aid young Florio, who was ju&s;t returned from &s;liding, and was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in the garden with making men of &s;now. Mr. Gardener his father, hearing the&s;e words, &s;aid to him, My dear, thou wilt do me a plea&s;ure to write down that wi&s;h on my tablets. Florio complied, and wrote while his hand trembled with cold. The win|ter pa&s;&s;ed away, and &s;pring &s;ucceeded. Florio was walk|ing
<PB N="6" REF="17">along with his father be&s;ide a border in the garden, where the hyacinth, auricula and narci&s;&s;us were in perfect bloom. He felt the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ure in breathing their perfume, and admiring their fre&s;h and vivid colours. The&s;e are the productions of Spring, &s;aid Mr. Gardener to him. They are beautiful, but of very &s;hort duration. Oh! replied Florio, that it were always Spring! Be &s;o good as to write that wi&s;h in my tablets. Florio obeyed while his heart beat with joy. The Spring very &s;oon made room for Summer. Florio, one fine day, went out to take a walk with his parents and &s;ome of his young acquaintance to a neighbouring village. Their walk afforded them a pro&s;pect &s;ometimes of green corn fields, waving &s;moothly like a calm &s;ea lightly agitated by the breeze; and &s;ometimes of meadows enamelled with a thou&s;and flowers. On every &s;ide they beheld young lambs at play, and the high &s;pirited colts and fillies &s;porting round their dams. They eat cherries, &s;trawberries, and other fruits of the &s;ea&s;on, and pa&s;&s;ed the whole day in amu&s;ing them&s;elves in the fields. Do not you think, Florio, &s;aid Mr. Gardener as they were returning to town, that the Summer too hath its plea&s;ures! Oh! replied he, I wi&s;h it would la&s;t all the year; and at the reque&s;t of his father he wrote down this wi&s;h too on his tablets. At length the Autumn arrived. All the family went to &s;pend a day in the country, at harve&s;t time. The weather was not quite &s;o hot as in Summer; the air was mild, and the &s;ky clear. The gardens and orchards were loaded with fruits. The round plump melons from their rich beds diffu&s;ed a delicious odour; and the branches of the pear|trees bent under the weight of the fine&s;t pears. This was a day of fea&s;ting for Florio, who loved nothing &s;o much as grapes, melons and peaches; and he had the additional plea&s;ure of gathering them him&s;elf. This fine &s;ea&s;on, &s;aid his father to him, will &s;oon pa&s;s away. Winter is advancing towards us very fa&s;t, to deprive us of the Autumn.

<HEAD>THE SNOW.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER many deceitful promi&s;es of its return, Spring at length arrived. A gentle breeze warmed the air. The &s;now was &s;een to melt, the fields to re&s;ume their ver|dure, and the flowers to bud forth. The &s;inging of birds was heard on every &s;ide. Little Loui&s;a was already gone
<PB N="8" REF="19">out to the country with her father. She had heard the fir&s;t &s;ongs of the blackbird and the linnet, and &s;he had gathered &s;ome of the earlie&s;t violets. But the weather changed once more. There aro&s;e &s;uddenly a violent north|wind, that whi&s;tled through the groves, and covered the roads with &s;now. Little Loui&s;a went to bed that night &s;hivering with cold, and ble&s;&s;ed God for having given her &s;o comfortable a &s;helter from the inclemency of the air. Ah! what a &s;ight when &s;he aro&s;e the next morning! Every thing was perfectly white. There had fallen du|ring the night &s;o great a quantity of &s;now, that it was knee-deep in the roads. This made Loui&s;a quite dull. The little birds appeared &s;till more &s;o. The ground being every where covered to a great depth, they were not able to find the lea&s;t grain or worm to appea&s;e their hunger. All the feathered inhabitants of the grove took refuge in the towns and villages, to &s;eek the relief of man. Nu|merous flights of &s;parrows, linnets, chaffinches and larks, alighted in the &s;treets and court-yards of hou&s;es, and &s;craped with their claws and bills into every heap of rub|bi&s;h, to find if po&s;&s;ible &s;ome nouri&s;hment. There came near fifty of the&s;e gue&s;ts into the yard of the hou&s;e where Loui&s;a was. She &s;aw them, and returned quite afflicted into her father's chamber. What is the matter, my dear? &s;aid he. Ah! papa, an&s;wered &s;he, there they are, all in the yard. The poor little birds that &s;ung &s;o chearfully only two days ago. They &s;eem to be quite &s;tarved with cold, and to a&s;k for &s;omething to eat. Will you let me give them a little corn? With the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, &s;aid her father. The barn was on the other &s;ide of the way: thither &s;he ran, accompanied by her governe&s;s, to get a few handfuls of corn and hemp-&s;eed, and came imme|diately back to &s;catter it in the yard. The little birds approached, fluttering about her in great numbers, and picking up every grain. Loui&s;a amu&s;ed her&s;elf in look|ing at them, and was quite delighted with the &s;ight. She went to a&s;k her papa and mama to come and view them al&s;o, and to partake of her &s;atisfaction. But the&s;e hand|fuls of grain were &s;oon picked up. The birds then flew up to the hou&s;e-top, and &s;eemed to eye Loui&s;a wi&s;tfully, as if they would have &s;aid, "Ha&s;t thou nothing more to give us?" Loui&s;a under&s;tood their language. She flies like lightning to &s;eek more grain. In cro&s;&s;ing the way
<PB N="9" REF="20">&s;he met a little boy, who had not a heart quite &s;o compa&s;|&s;ionate as hers. He was carrying in his hand a cage full of birds, and was &s;haking it &s;o carele&s;sly that the poor little creatures were thrown every moment with their heads again&s;t the wires. This &s;ight gave Loui&s;a pain. What are you going to do with tho&s;e birds? &s;aid &s;he to the little boy. I do not know yet, an&s;wered he. I am trying to &s;ell them, and if nobody will buy them I &s;hall fea&s;t my cat upon them at home. Your cat! replied Loui&s;a: Your cat? Oh! what an ill-natured boy! As to that, they would not be the fir&s;t that &s;he has munched alive. So, dangling his cage as before, he was &s;etting off at a great pace, when Loui&s;a called him back, and a&s;ked how much he would have for his birds? I will &s;ell them, &s;aid he, three for a penny, and there are eighteen of them. Well then, &s;aid Loui&s;a, they are mine. So bidding the little boy to follow her, &s;he ran to her papa, and a&s;ked his permi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e tho&s;e birds. Her father granted it with plea|&s;ure, and even gave his daughter an empty room for the reception of her little gue&s;ts. Jack (that was the name of the ill-natured boy) went away very well &s;atisfied with his bargain, and told all his companions that he knew a little mi&s;s who would buy birds. In a few hours there came &s;o many little country boys to Loui&s;a's door that one would have thought it the entrance to a market. They all crouded round her, climbing upon each other, and holding up their cages with both hands, each hoping to obtain the preference for his birds. Loui&s;a purcha&s;ed all that were brought before her, and had them carried into the chamber where the fir&s;t were. Night came. It was a long time &s;ince Loui&s;a had gone to bed &s;o well plea&s;ed in her mind. Am not I very happy, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, in being able to &s;ave the lives of &s;o many inno|cent creatures, and to give them food? When Summer comes, I will go into the fields and groves, and all my little gue&s;ts will &s;ing their &s;weete&s;t &s;ongs to thank me for the care that I have taken of them. With this reflexion &s;he went to &s;leep, and dreamed that &s;he was in a grove of trees of the fine&s;t verdure, which were all covered with birds chirping as they fluttered from bough to bough, or engaged in &s;eeding their young ones. The happy Loui&s;a &s;miled in her &s;leep. She ro&s;e very early to go and feed her little friends in the aviary and in the yard: but &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="21">was not now &s;o happy as &s;he had been the day before. She knew how much money &s;he had put into her pur&s;e, and that there could not remain much of it by this time. If this &s;nowy weather &s;hould la&s;t &s;ome few days longer, &s;aid &s;he, what will become of the other birds? The wicked little boys will give them alive, as they are, to their cats! and for want of a &s;mall &s;um of money I &s;hall not be able to &s;ave them. Full of the&s;e &s;orrowful ideas &s;he draws her pur&s;e out &s;lowly in order to count her little trea|&s;ure once more; but how great is her a&s;toni&s;hment to feel her pur&s;e heavy! She opens it and finds it full of pieces of coin, of every &s;ort indi&s;criminately, up to the very &s;trings. She runs immediately to her father, and relates the incident to him with tran&s;ports of plea&s;ure and &s;ur|pri&s;e. Her father took her to his bo&s;om, ki&s;&s;ed her, and &s;hed tears of joy upon the cheeks of Loui&s;a. My dear child, &s;aid he, thou ha&s;t never made me &s;o happy as in this moment. Continue to relieve the little creatures that thou &s;halt &s;ee in di&s;tre&s;s, and in proportion as thy pur&s;e is dimini&s;hed, thou &s;halt find it filled again. What joy|ful news for Loui&s;a! She ran immediately to her aviary, with her apron-full of hemp-&s;eed and corn. All the birds came fluttering round her, and looked with eager eyes for their breakfa&s;t. After feeding them, &s;he next went down into the yard, and be&s;towed a plentiful meal upon the fami&s;hed birds that were there. She &s;aw her&s;elf now en|gaged in the &s;upport of almo&s;t an hundred dependents. This afforded her &s;uch a plea&s;ure! Her dolls and play|things never had given her half &s;o much. In the after|noon, as &s;he put her hand into the bag of hemp-&s;eed, &s;he found a note with the&s;e words: <HI>The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee, O Lord! and thou give&s;t them their food; thou opene&s;t thy hand, and fille&s;t all things living with plen|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Her father had followed her. She turned to him, and &s;aid, I am now therefore like God. The in|habitants of the air fly towards me, and when I open my hand, I fill them with plenteou&s;ne&s;s. Yes, my dear, &s;aid her father, every time that thou doe&s;t good to any crea|ture, thou art like God. When grown up thou &s;halt a&s;&s;i&s;t thy fellow-creatures as thou now do&s;t the birds, and thou &s;halt then re&s;emble God much more. Ah, what happine&s;s for a mortal to be able to act like God! Du|ring a week, Loui&s;a continued to extend her bounty, and
<PB N="11" REF="22">feed every thing that was hungry about her. At length the &s;now melted, the fields re&s;umed their verdure, and the birds, which before had not dared to quit the neigh|bourhood of the hou&s;es, now turned their flight toward the grove. But tho&s;e that had been put into the aviary remained there confined: they &s;aw the &s;un, flew up again&s;t the window, pecked at the gla&s;s, but in vain; their pri|&s;on was too &s;trong for them. Loui&s;a could not as yet imagine what made them &s;o unea&s;y. One day, as &s;he was taking them their food, her father entered a few moments after her. She was very happy to &s;ee that he was de&s;irous of being witne&s;s to her plea&s;ure. My dear Loui&s;a, &s;aid he, why do the&s;e birds &s;eem &s;o unea&s;y? I &s;hould imagine that they want &s;omething. May not they, perhaps, have left in the fields companions whom they would now be glad to &s;ee again? You are right, papa; they &s;eem to be dull ever &s;ince the return of the fine weather. I will go and open the window, and let them fly away. I think thou woulde&s;t not do ami&s;s, replied her father. Thou wilt diffu&s;e joy through all the country. The&s;e little pri&s;oners will go to find their friends once more, and will fly to meet them, as thou do&s;t to meet me when I have been ab&s;ent &s;ome time from home. Before he had fini&s;hed &s;peaking, the windows were all thrown up: the birds perceived it, and in two minutes there did not remain a &s;ingle one of them in the room. Some were &s;een to &s;kim along the ground; others to &s;oar up into the air; &s;ome to perch upon the neighbouring trees, and others to fly backwards and forwards before the windows with chirpings of joy. Loui&s;a went every day to walk in the fields. She &s;aw and heard numbers of birds on every &s;ide. At one time a lark would ri&s;e up before her feet, and &s;ing its &s;prightly &s;train while it mounted to the clouds. At another time a linnet, perched upon the highe&s;t branches of a tree, chirped forth its &s;ong. And whenever &s;he ob&s;erved any one to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf by the &s;weetne&s;s of its mu&s;ic, Loui&s;a would &s;ay, There is one of my little gue&s;ts: one may know by its voice that it has been well fed la&s;t Winter.</P>

<P>A Poor labourer, of the name of Bernard, had &s;ix young children, and found him&s;elf much at a lo&s;s to main|tain them. As an addition to his misfortune, the &s;ea&s;on happened to be unfavorable, and con&s;equently bread much dearer than the year before. Bernard worked day and night, yet in &s;pite of his labours could not po&s;&s;ibly earn money enough to provide food (even of the mo&s;t indifferent &s;ort) for &s;ix hungry children. He was reduced to extremity. Calling therefore one day his little family together, with tears in his eyes he &s;aid to them, My dear children, bread is ri&s;en &s;o dear that with all my labour I am not able to earn &s;ufficient for your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. You &s;ee how I am circum&s;tanced. This piece of bread in my hand mu&s;t be paid for with the wages of my whole day's labour, and therefore you mu&s;t be content to &s;hare with me the little that I have been able to earn. There certainly will not be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy you all; but at lea&s;t there will be enough to prevent your peri&s;hing with hunger. The poor man could &s;ay no more: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and wept. His children wept al&s;o, and each one &s;aid within him&s;elf, O Lord, come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unfortunate infants that we are! Help our dear father, and &s;uffer us not to peri&s;h for want! Bernard divided the bread into &s;even equal &s;hares: he kept one for him&s;elf, and di&s;tributed the re&s;t among&s;t his children. But one of them, named Arthur, refu&s;ed to take his por|tion, and &s;aid, I cannot eat any thing, father; I find my&s;elf &s;ick. Do you take my part, or divide it among&s;t the re&s;t. My poor child! what is the matter with thee? &s;aid Bernard, taking him up in his arms. I am &s;ick, an&s;wered Arthur; very &s;ick. I would go to bed.

He made them all &s;it down at table, and eat heartily, until they were &s;atisfied. It was a de|lightful &s;ight for the good phy&s;ician, to behold the joy of tho&s;e innocent creatures.

Other charitable per&s;ons al&s;o, to whom he related the circum&s;tance, imitated his genero&s;ity. Some &s;ent them provi&s;ions, &s;ome money, and others clothes and linen, in&s;omuch that very few days pa&s;&s;ed before this little family had more of every thing than was &s;ufficient for their wants.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Bernard's landlord was informed of what the generous little Arthur had &s;uffered for his father and his brothers, filled with admiration at &s;uch noblene&s;s of &s;oul, he &s;ent for Bernard, and addre&s;&s;ed him thus: You have an admirable &s;on; permit me to be his father al&s;o. I will allow you an annuity out of my own pocket, and Arthur, with all your other children, &s;hall be maintained at my expence, in whatever profe&s;&s;ions they &s;hall chu&s;e. If they make u&s;e of this e&s;tabli&s;hment to their own advantage, I will charge my&s;elf with the care of their fortunes.</P>
<P>Bernard returned to his hou&s;e tran&s;ported with joy, and throwing him&s;elf on his knees, ble&s;&s;ed God for having given him &s;o worthy a child.</P>

<P>MRS. P&mdash;, a young married lady, as much di&s;|tingui&s;hed for the elegant charms of her wit, as for the delicacy of her &s;entiments, and the re&s;pectability of her character, was one day reproving Pamela, her elde&s;t daughter, for a &s;light fault very pardonable at her age. Pamela, touched with the tender manner in which her mother delivered the reproof, &s;hed tears of &s;orrow and affection. Caroline, who was then but three years old, &s;eeing her &s;i&s;ter weep, climbs up the &s;teps of her chair, in order to reach her; with one hand &s;he takes her handker|chief, and wipes her &s;i&s;ter's eyes, and with the other &s;lips into her mouth a piece of &s;weetmeat from her own. I think, an able painter might make a charming picture on this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>THE CANARY-BIRD.</HEAD>
<P>CANARY-BIRDS to &s;ell! Who'll buy my Canary|birds? Fine Canary-birds! Thus cried a man pa&s;&s;ing by the hou&s;e of little Je&s;&s;y. Je&s;&s;y heard him: &s;he ran to the window, and looking into the &s;treet, &s;aw that it was a bird-&s;eller who carried upon his head a large cage full of Canary-birds. They jumped &s;o nimbly from perch to perch, and chirped &s;o &s;weetly, that Je&s;&s;y, in the eagerne&s;s of her curio&s;ity, was near falling out of the window, while &s;he endeavoured to have a nearer view of them. Will you buy a Canary-bird, mi&s;s? &s;aid the birdman to her. Perhaps I may, an&s;wered Je&s;&s;y; but that does not depend on me entirely. Stop a little; I will go and a&s;k my papa's leave. The man promi&s;ed to &s;top, and &s;eeing a bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, laid down his cage the&s;e and &s;tood by the &s;ide of it.

<P>I let him die of hunger or thir&s;t? Oh! no, cer|tainly I &s;ha'nt. Nay, I will never touch my own break|fa&s;t, before my bird has had his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Gower.</SPEAKER>
<P>Je&s;&s;y! Je&s;&s;y! you know you are very giddy! and then you have only to neglect him one day.</P>
<P>Je&s;&s;y promi&s;ed her father &s;o fairly; &s;he coaxed him &s;o much, and pulled his coat-&s;kirt &s;o often, that Mr. Gower con&s;ented at la&s;t to his daughter's reque&s;t. He cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet, leading her by the hand; and when they came up to the cage, they cho&s;e the prettie&s;t Canary-bird in it; a male, of the mo&s;t lively yellow, with a little black tuft upon his head. Who was ever &s;o happy as Je&s;&s;y then? She held her pur&s;e to her father, that he might pay for the bird. Mr. Gower then took money out of his own, to buy a hand&s;ome cage with drawers, and a water-cup of cry&s;tal. Je&s;&s;y had no &s;ooner given the Canary-bird po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its little palace, than &s;he ran to every part of the hou&s;e, calling her mama, her &s;i&s;ters and all the &s;ervants, and &s;hewing them the bird which her father had been &s;o good as to buy her. When any of her little friends came to &s;ee her, the fir&s;t words were, do you know I have the prettie&s;t Canary Bird in the world? he is as yellow as gold, and has a little black cre&s;t like the plumes of mama's hat. Come, I will &s;hew him to you; his name is Cherry. Cherry was quite happy under
<PB N="36" REF="47">Je&s;&s;y's care. The fir&s;t thing that &s;he thought of in the morning was to give him fre&s;h grain and the cleare&s;t wa|ter. Whenever there was any cake at table, Cherry had his part of it fir&s;t. She had always &s;ome bits of &s;ugar in &s;tore for him, and his cage was garni&s;hed with fre&s;h greens of one &s;ort or another. Cherry was not ungrateful to all the&s;e attentions. He &s;oon learned to di&s;tingui&s;h Je&s;&s;y; and the moment he heard her &s;tep in the room, what flut|tering of his wings! what ince&s;&s;ant chirpings! Je&s;&s;y al|mo&s;t devoured him with ki&s;&s;es. At the end of a week he began to &s;ing, and produced the mo&s;t delightful mu&s;ic. Sometimes he &s;welled his little notes to &s;uch a length, that one would have thought he mu&s;t expire from fatigue; then, after pau&s;ing a moment, he would begin again &s;weeter than ever, with a tone &s;o clear and brilliant that he could be heard all over the hou&s;e. Je&s;&s;y pa&s;&s;ed whole hours in li&s;tening to him as &s;he &s;at by his cage. She &s;ome|times would let her work fall out of her hands to gaze at him, and, after he had entertained her with a &s;weet &s;ong, &s;he regaled him in her turn with a tune upon the bird|organ which he would endeavour to imitate. The&s;e plea|&s;ures, however, became familiar to Je&s;&s;y. Her father, one day, made her a pre&s;ent of a book of prints. She was &s;o agreeably taken up with it that Cherry was &s;omething the le&s;s minded. He would chirp the moment that he &s;aw Je&s;&s;y, though ever &s;o far off; but Je&s;&s;y heard him not. Almo&s;t a week had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he had either had fre&s;h greens or bi&s;cuit. He repeated the &s;weete&s;t airs that Je&s;&s;y had taught him, and compo&s;ed new for her, but in vain. The truth was, Je&s;&s;y's thoughts were otherwi&s;e engaged. Her birth-day came on, when her godfather gave her a great jointed doll. This doll, which &s;he called Colum|bine, completely bani&s;hed all thoughts of Cherry. From morning till night &s;he was bu&s;ied with nothing but dre&s;|&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Columbine a hundred times, talking to her, and carrying her up and down the room. The poor bird was very happy to get &s;ome food towards evening. Sometimes it happened that he was obliged to wait for it till the next day. At length, one day when Mr. Gower was at table, and ca&s;t his eye accidentally upon the cage, he &s;aw the Canary-bird lying upon its brea&s;t and panting for breath. Its feathers were ruffled, and it &s;eemed contracted all of a lump. Mr. Gower
<PB N="37" REF="48">went clo&s;e up to it; but no more fond chirpings! The poor little creature had &s;carce &s;trength enough left to breathe. Je&s;&s;y, cried Mr. Gower, what is the matter with your Canary-bird? Je&s;&s;y blu&s;hed. Why, papa, I &mdash; &s;omehow, I forgot;&mdash;and all in a tremble &s;he ran to fetch the box of &s;eed. Mr. Gower took down the cage, and examined the drawer and the water-cup. Alas! Cherry had not a &s;ingle grain, nor a drop of water. Ah! poor bird! cried Mr. Gower; thou art fallen into cruel hands! If I had fore&s;een this, I &s;hould never have bought thee. All the company ro&s;e from table, holding up their hands, and crying, The poor bird! Mr. Gower put &s;ome &s;eed into the drawer, and filled the cup with fre&s;h water, but had much difficulty in bringing Cherry back to life. Je&s;&s;y left the table, and went up into her cham|ber, crying, and made her handkerchief quite wet with her tears. The next day Mr. Gower ordered the bird to be carried out of the hou&s;e, and given as a pre&s;ent to the &s;on of Mr. Mercer, his neighbour, who was counted a very careful boy, and would pay more attention to him than Je&s;&s;y had done. But, to hear the little girl's com|plaints and expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow! Ah! my dear bird! my poor Cherry! Indeed I promi&s;e you faithfully, papa, that I will never forget him a &s;ingle moment as long as I live. Only leave him with me this once. Mr. Gower &s;uffered him&s;elf at length to be touched with Je&s;&s;y's en|treaties, and gave her back the Canary-bird, but not without a &s;evere reprimand for her negligence, and the &s;tricte&s;t injunction as to the future. This poor little crea|ture, &s;ays he, is &s;hut up, and therefore not able to pro|vide for its own wants. Whenever you want any thing, you can a&s;k for it; but Cherry cannot make people un|der&s;tand his language. If ever you let him &s;uffer hunger or thir&s;t again&mdash; At the&s;e words Je&s;&s;y &s;hed a flood of tears. She took her papa's hand and ki&s;&s;ed it, but her grief was &s;o full that &s;he could not utter a word. Now Je&s;&s;y was once more mi&s;tre&s;s of Cherry, and Cherry was &s;incerely reconciled with Je&s;&s;y. About a month after, Mr. Gower was obliged to go into the country for a few days with his lady. Je&s;&s;y, Je&s;&s;y, &s;aid he, in parting with his daughter, I earne&s;tly recommend poor Cherry to your care. Her parents were &s;carcely got into the carriage, when Je&s;&s;y ran to the cage, and carefully provided the
<PB N="38" REF="49">bird with every thing nece&s;&s;ary. In a few hours after, her time began to hang heavy. She &s;ent for &s;ome of her little acquaintance, and &s;oon recovered her chearfulne&s;s. They went out to walk together, and at their return &s;pent part of the evening in playing at blind-man's buff and four corners. After that they danced. In fine, the little company broke up very late, and Je&s;&s;y went to bed quite fatigued. The next morning &s;he awoke by break of day, and began thinking on the amu&s;ements of the evening before. If her governe&s;s had let her, &s;he would have run as &s;oon as &s;he got up, to &s;ee the Mi&s;s Mar&s;halls, but was obliged to wait till after dinner. However, &s;he had &s;carcely fini&s;hed it, before &s;he de&s;ired to be conducted to their hou&s;e: and Cherry!&mdash;he was obliged to &s;tay at home alone, and to fa&s;t. The following day was al&s;o &s;pent in amu&s;ements: and Cherry!&mdash;he was forgotten again. It was the &s;ame the third day: and Cherry!&mdash;who could think of him in the mid&s;t of &s;uch diver&s;ions? The fourth day, Mr. and Mrs. Gower returned from the country. Je&s;&s;y had thought very little about their return. Her father had &s;carce ki&s;&s;ed her and enquired after her health, before he a&s;ked, How is Cherry? Very well, cried Je&s;&s;y, a little confu&s;ed; and &s;he ran towards the cage to carry him &s;ome water. Alas! the poor little creature was no more. He was laid upon his back, with his wings &s;pread and his bill open. Je&s;&s;y &s;creamed out and wrung her hands. Every one in the hou&s;e ran up, and was eye-witne&s;s of the di&s;a&s;ter. Ah! poor bird! cried Mr. Gower; how painful has thy death been! If I had wrung thy head off the day that I went to the country, thou woulde&s;t have had but the pain of a mo|ment, whereas now thou ha&s;t endured for &s;everal days the pangs of hunger and thir&s;t, and ha&s;t died in a long and cruel agony. However, thou art &s;till happy in being delivered from the hands of &s;o pitile&s;s a guardian. Je&s;&s;y would have hid her&s;elf in the bowels of the earth: &s;he would have given all her play-things, and all her pocket|money, to purcha&s;e the life of Cherry; but it was then too late. Mr. Gower took the bird, and had its &s;kin &s;tuffed and hung up from the ceiling. Je&s;&s;y did not dare to look at it: her eyes were filled with tears whenever &s;he chanced to perceive it, and every day &s;he entreated her father to remove it from her &s;ight. Mr. Gower did not

<P>Ju&s;t as you like!</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53">A third fit of pouting, more &s;ullen and peevi&s;h than before. Camillus goes for his whip: Julia takes up her doll. But the whip refu&s;es to crack: the doll's dre&s;&s;ing goes all wrong. Camillus &s;ighs, Julia weeps. This in|terval brought on dinner-hour; and Mr. Orpin came to a&s;k them, if they cho&s;e to have it &s;erved up. But what is the matter with you? &s;aid he, &s;eeing them both quite dull. Nothing, papa, an&s;wered the children, and wiping their eyes, followed their father into the dining|room. The dinner this day con&s;i&s;ted of a number of di&s;hes, and a bottle of wine was opened for each of the children. My dear children, &s;aid Mr. Orpin, if I had &s;till my former authority over you, I would forbid you to ta&s;te all the&s;e di&s;hes, and particularly to drink wine. At lea&s;t, I would de&s;ire you to be very &s;paring of them, be|cau&s;e I know how dangerous wine and high-fea&s;oned food are to children. But ye are now your own ma&s;ters, and may eat and drink whatever ye fancy. The children did not wait to be told this twice. The one &s;wallowed great bits of meat without bread; the other took &s;auce in whole &s;poonfuls: and they drank full bumpers of wine, without remembering to mix water with it. My dear, whi&s;pered Mrs. Orpin to her hu&s;band, they will make them&s;elves &s;ick. I fear they will, my dear, an&s;wered Mr. Orpin; but I would rather that they &s;hould learn for once at their own expence how much one may &s;uffer from ignorance, than by a premature attention deprive them of the fruits of &s;o important a le&s;&s;on. Mrs. Orpin &s;aw her hu&s;band's intention, and therefore &s;uffered our thoughtle&s;s little couple to indulge their greedine&s;s. The cloth was now removed. The children had &s;tuffed as long as they were able, and their little heads began to be heated. Come with me, Julia, cried Camillus, and took his &s;i&s;ter with him into the garden. Mr. Orpin thought proper to follow them unob&s;erved. There was a little pond in the garden, and at the edge of the pond a &s;mall boat. Camillus had a mind to go into it Julia &s;topped him. You know, &s;aid &s;he, that we mu&s;t not go there. Mu&s;t not? an&s;wered Camillus. Do you forget that we are our own ma&s;ters? Oh! that is true, &s;aid Julia: &s;o, giving her hand to her brother, they both went into the boat. Mr. Orphin drew nearer to them, but did not chu&s;e to di&s;cover him&s;elf yet. He knew that
<PB N="43" REF="54">the pond was not deep. Even if they fall in, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, I &s;hall not have much trouble in getting them out. The two children wi&s;hed to di&s;engage the boat from the bank, and pu&s;h it out towards the middle of the pond; but they were not able to untie the knots of the rope which held it fa&s;t. Since we cannot fail, &s;aid the giddy Camillus, we may at lea&s;t balance our&s;elves. So, &s;triding acro&s;s the boat, he began to pre&s;s it down, fir&s;t on one &s;ide, then on the other. Their heads being a little dizzy, it was not long before their legs failed them. They laid hold of each other to &s;upport them&s;elves, and fell both <HI>plump</HI> upon the &s;ide of the boat, and from thence into the water. Mr. Orpin flew like lightning from the place where he had been hid. He threw him&s;elf into the water, &s;eized his ra&s;h children one in each hand, and brought them back into the hou&s;e, half dead with terror. They felt them&s;elves violently &s;ick while they were un|dre&s;&s;ing and rubbing with cloths. At length they were put each in a warm bed: they fell alternately into a &s;tupor and convul&s;ions: they complained of a dreadful head-ach and pains in the bowels, were &s;eized with frequent faint|ing fits, and in the intervals with &s;hudderings, &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach, and difficulty of breathing. In this deplora|ble condition they pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day: they &s;obbed and wept, till at length they fell fa&s;t a&s;leep through wea|rine&s;s. Early the next morning their father entered their chamber, and a&s;ked how they had pa&s;&s;ed the night. Very ill, an&s;wered both in a feeble voice: we could not lie ea&s;y in bed, and feel a &s;ickne&s;s yet in the head and &s;tomach. Poor children, how I pity you! But, added he a moment after, what will ye do with your liberty to-day? Ye remember that ye enjoy it &s;till. Oh! no, no, an&s;wered both eagerly. And why, my little friends? Ye &s;aid, the other day, that it was &s;o di&s;agreeable to be &s;ubject to the direction of others. We have been well puni&s;hed for our folly, replied Camillus. And &s;hall take warning for a long time, added Julia.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye will not be your own ma&s;ters then, any longer?</P>

<P>It will be much better for us both.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, papa; we are ready to do whatever you &s;hall think proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Orpin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I have here a yellow powder, called rhubarb. It has an unplea&s;ing ta&s;te, but is excellent for tho&s;e who have hurt their &s;tomachs by exce&s;s. Since ye con&s;ent to follow my orders, I command you in&s;tantly to take this powder. Let me &s;ee you obey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, yes, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would take it, though it were as bitter as &s;oot.</P>
<P>Mr. Orpin gave them the medicine, and the children, without making, as formerly, any grimaces, endeavoured each to excel the other in taking it with a chearful coun|tenance. This remedy happily had its effect, and they both recovered very &s;oon. After that, whenever their parents would terrify them with threats of puni&s;hment, they would &s;ay, We &s;hall let you be your own ma&s;ters! and the children &s;elt more terror from this threat than many others to whom one &s;hould &s;ay, I will put you in pri&s;on!</P>

<HEAD>THE BUSHES.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine evening in the month of May, Mr. Ogilby was &s;itting with Algernon, his &s;on, upon the &s;ide of a &s;mall hill, from whence he pointed out to him the beau|ties of nature as they lay before him. The &s;etting &s;un, in taking his la&s;t adieu, &s;eemed to have clothed every thing in a robe of purple. They were rou&s;ed from this plea&s;ing meditation by the chearful &s;ong of a &s;hepherd who was driving back his bleating flock from a neigh|bouring field. On each &s;ide of his road there grew up thorn-bu&s;hes which no &s;heep approached without leaving upon them &s;ome part of her fleece. Little Algernon grew quite angry at tho&s;e robbers. Do you &s;ee, papa, cried he, tho&s;e bu&s;hes, how they rob the &s;heep of their wool? Why did God make tho&s;e ill-natured brambles? or why do not all men join with one accord to de&s;troy them? If the poor &s;heep come back this &s;ame way again, they will leave the
<PB N="45" REF="56">re&s;t of their clothing upon them. But, no; I will ri&s;e to-morrow at break of day, and come with my bill-hook, and &s;nip-&s;nap, cut all tho&s;e briars down to the ground. You &s;hall come with me, papa, and bring a little axe, and the whole &s;hall be fini&s;hed before breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>We will think of your project, an&s;wered Mr. Ogilby. But in the mean time do not be unju&s;tly angry with tho&s;e bu&s;hes. Remember what we do about Lammas.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do we do then? papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not you &s;een the &s;hepherds arm them|&s;elves with great &s;hears, and rob the trembling &s;heep not of a few locks of wool only, but of their whole fleece?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, papa, becau&s;e they want it to make them&s;elves clothes; but tho&s;e bu&s;hes rob them out of mere &s;pite, and without having the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know what purpo&s;e the&s;e bits of wool may &s;erve to them; but &s;uppo&s;ing that they &s;erved none, has a per&s;on any right to appropriate a thing to him&s;elf, merely becau&s;e he wants it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have heard you &s;ay, papa, that &s;heep na|turally lo&s;e their fleeces about that time of the year; then it is much better to take it for our u&s;e, than to &s;uffer it to fall off quite u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your remark is ju&s;t. Nature hath given all bea&s;ts a clothing, and we are obliged from them to borrow ours, unle&s;s we chu&s;e to go quite naked and re|main expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the Winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alger.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a bu&s;h has no occa&s;ion for clothing. So you &s;ee, papa, we mu&s;t not give up our de&s;ign. I &s;hall certainly cut all the&s;e thorns down to-morrow. You will come along with me, won't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ogilby.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. Come then, now for to-morrow morning by break of day.</P>
<P>Algernon, who thought him&s;elf already an hero, merely from the thought of de&s;troying with his little arm this legion of robbers, could hardly &s;leep, taken up as he was with his victories of the next day. Scarce had the chear|ful &s;inging of the birds that perched on the trees near his windows announced the return of the dawn, before he ha&s;ted to awake his father. Mr. Ogilby, on the other hand, though indifferent as to the fate of the thorn-bu&s;hes, yet, plea&s;ed with the opportunity of &s;hewing to his &s;on the beauties of the opening day, was no le&s;s eager to quit
<PB N="46" REF="57">his bed. They dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves ha&s;tily, took their in|&s;truments, and &s;et forward on the expedition. Algernon went before with an air of triumph, and Mr. Ogilby had &s;ome difficulty to keep up with him. As they approached the bu&s;hes, they &s;aw a number of little birds flying back|wards and forwards among&s;t them, and fluttering about the branches. Softly! &s;aid Mr. Ogilby to his &s;on. Let us &s;u&s;pend our vengeance for a moment, for fear of di&s;|turbing tho&s;e innocent creatures. Let us go up again to that part of the hill where we &s;at ye&s;terday evening, and examine what it is that tho&s;e birds &s;eem to &s;eek &s;o bu&s;ily. They went up the hill, &s;eated them&s;elves, and looked on. They &s;aw that the birds were employed in carrying away tho&s;e bits of wool in their beaks, which the bu&s;hes had torn from the &s;heep the evening before. There came multitudes of yellow-hammers, chaffinches, linnets and nightingales, who loaded them&s;elves with this plunder. What is the meaning of that? cried Algernon, quite a&s;to|ni&s;hed. It means, replied his father, that Providence takes care of the &s;malle&s;t creatures, and furni&s;hes them with every expedient for their happine&s;s and pre&s;ervation. You &s;ee, the poor birds find here a lining for the habi|tation which they prepare for their young. They make ready, you &s;ee, a very comfortable bed for them&s;elves and their little family. Thus the hone&s;t thorn-bu&s;h, again&s;t which you were &s;o ea&s;ily provoked ye&s;terday, unites the inhabitants of the air with tho&s;e of the earth. He takes from the rich his &s;uperfluities, to &s;atisfy the wants of the poor. Will you come now, and cut him down? Heaven forbid, cried Algernon. Thou art right, my &s;on, replied Mr. Ogilby. Let him flouri&s;h in peace, &s;ince he makes &s;o generous a u&s;e of his conque&s;ts.</P>

<P>THERE lived once in Bri&s;tol a crazy per&s;on who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph. He never went out without having five or &s;ix wigs on his head at once, and as many muffs upon each of his arms. Though his &s;en&s;es were di&s;ordered, he was not mi&s;chievous, and mu&s;t be teazed a long time to be put in a pa&s;&s;ion. Whenever he walked
<PB N="47" REF="58">the &s;treets, a number of trouble&s;ome little boys would come out of the hou&s;es and follow him, crying, Jo&s;eph! Jo&s;eph! how do you &s;ell your wigs and your muffs?

<P>If you had known this man at the very time when he was &s;tript of his e&s;tate, and if he had &s;aid to you, My dear Henry, I am unfortunate; I have ju&s;t lo&s;t an inheritance which I long enjoyed peaceably; all my property is gone to &s;upport the expence of a law-&s;uit; I have now neither town-hou&s;e nor country-hou&s;e; in &s;hort, nothing upon earth left. Would you have laughed at him then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid! who could be &s;o wicked as to laugh at a man in his misfortunes! I &s;hould much rather have endeavoured to comfort him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, is he happier now, when he has lo&s;t his rea&s;on be&s;ides?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the contrary, he is much more to be pi|tied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this day you in&s;ult and throw &s;tones at an unfortunate man, whom you would have en|deavoured to comfort when he was le&s;s an object of pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, I have done wrong; forgive me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="59">
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pardon you willingly, if you are &s;orry for your fault. But my pardon is not &s;ufficient. There is another who&s;e forgivene&s;s you have &s;till to a&s;k.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I offended him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Jo&s;eph had retained his &s;en&s;es, it would certainly be his pardon that you &s;hould demand; but as he is not able to under&s;tand what is meant by pardon, it were u&s;ele&s;s to addre&s;s your&s;elf to him. Yet you think that every one &s;hould a&s;k pardon of tho&s;e whom he has offended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you have taught me, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know who it is that has commanded us to have compa&s;&s;ion upon the unfortunate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Denham.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you have not &s;hewn compa&s;&s;ion to poor Jo&s;eph: on the contrary, you have aggravated his mi&s;ery by your in&s;ults. Do you think that &s;uch conduct does not offend God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I acknowledge it, and will a&s;k forgivene&s;s of him to-night in my prayers.</P>
</SP>
<P>Henry kept his word; he repented of his fault, and at night a&s;ked pardon of God from the bottom of his heart. And he not only cea&s;ed to trouble Jo&s;eph for &s;everal weeks him&s;elf, but he hindered al&s;o others of his comrades from in&s;ulting him. In &s;pite of his fair re&s;olu|tions, however, he happened one day to mix in the rabble of boys who were following him. 'Tis true, it was purely out of curio&s;ity, and only to &s;ee the tricks that they played upon this poor man. Now and then he could not refrain from hallooing like the re&s;t, Jo&s;eph! Jo&s;eph! and by degrees came to be the foremo&s;t in the mob. At length Jo&s;eph's patience being tired by the &s;houts that pur&s;ued him, he turned &s;hort about, and taking up a large &s;tone, threw it at him with &s;uch violence that it grazed his cheek, and almo&s;t cut off part of his ear. Henry returned home all over blood, and roaring heartily. It is a ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment on you from God, &s;aid Mr. Denham, But, replied Henry, Why have I alone been hurt, while my compa|nions, who u&s;ed him much wor&s;e than I did, have not been puni&s;hed? The rea&s;on is, an&s;wered his father, that you knew better than the others, what a fault you were
<PB N="49" REF="60">committing, and con&s;equently your offence was more criminal. It is very ju&s;t that a child who knows the commands of God, and of his father, &s;hould be doubly puni&s;hed, whenever he has &s;uch a di&s;regard of his duty as to violate them.</P>

<P>Oh dear! you terrify me with your &s;wearing. But only hear me. I went to glean down in yonder field, and there was a good-natured old man who &s;aw me at work.

<P>With plea&s;ure, my dear. When I fixed him in his employment, I gave him in charge to rid my grounds of vagrants, and to carry all &s;uch, when found upon them, before a ju&s;tice.

<P>Very right, my dear boy! for circum|&s;tances alter things exceedingly. For in&s;tance, you did not &s;hew &s;ufficient reflexion in your di&s;pute with him.

<P>It &s;ufficed to maintain me for a few years in Dor&s;et&s;hire, during which time I continued to flatter my&s;elf with the expectation of obtaining a &s;mall jointure. But at length &s;eeing all my hopes fru&s;trated, I took the re&s;olution of returning to London to my former benefac|tre&s;s. On my arrival, I learned that &s;he had died a &s;hort time before. Having then no other re&s;ource than to fell what remained of my clothes and jewels, and to work with my own hands for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I retired to Rich|mond, to live private and unknown. And there I met &s;ome time ago a woman whom I had formerly known, and who lives in this village.</P>

<P>To your hu&s;band I owe my life. How happy am I then in being able to repay that kindne&s;s to his wife and his child! I &s;erved under him la&s;t war. In a

<P>Some days after, I was &s;ent with a detachment upon a very dangerous expedition. We were &s;urrounded and forced to yield after a long re&s;i&s;tance. My baggage had been plundered, &s;o that I was &s;tript of both clothes and money. Colonel Jennings being informed of my &s;ituation procured me a recommendation to the enemy's general. Through his exertions I obtained every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance requi&s;ite whil&s;t under cure for a deep wound that I received. I was more than two years in recovering; and when we were ordered home, had barely time to pay him a vi&s;it of acknowledgment before I was obliged to go on board immediately for the We&s;t-Indies. I married there to my advantage; and in con&s;equence of that cir|cum&s;tance, returned to England about &s;ix years ago. I was preparing to fly to him, when I heard that he was no more.

<HEAD>CECILIA AND MARIAN.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the &s;un had ri&s;en above the horizon to en|liven with his &s;plendor one of the fine&s;t mornings of the &s;pring, young Cecilia went down into her father's garden to ta&s;te with more appetite, as &s;he roved through its walks, the &s;weetne&s;s of a little cake of which &s;he in|tended to make her breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Every thing that could add to the beauties of the ri&s;ing day united to charm her. The pure breath of zephyr, while it diffu&s;ed a calm around, refre&s;hed every &s;en&s;e. Her palate was fea&s;ted with &s;weets; her eye with the lively fre&s;hne&s;s of the &s;pringing verdure; her &s;mell with the balmy perfume of a thou&s;and flowers; and that her ear alone might not be without its &s;hare of delight, two nightingales perching near her on the top of a green ar|bour, charmed her with their morning &s;ong. Cecilia was &s;o tran&s;ported with all the&s;e delicious &s;en&s;ations that her fine eyes were bedewed with a moi&s;ture which, however, re&s;ted on her eye-lids without dropping in tears. Her heart felt a &s;oft emotion and was impre&s;&s;ed with feelings of tenderne&s;s and benevolence. All at once this agree|able calm was interrupted by the &s;ound of &s;teps, and a little girl came forward towards the &s;ame walk, eating with great appetite a piece of coar&s;e brown bread. As &s;he, too, came into the garden for amu&s;ement, her eyes wandered from one object to another, without being fixed on any; &s;o that &s;he came clo&s;e up to Cecilia before &s;he per|ceived her. On &s;eeing who it was, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort a moment, and looked down; then like a young deer that is frightened, and almo&s;t as &s;wift as one, &s;he ran back again with all her &s;peed. Stop, &s;top, cried Cecilia, wait for me; why do you run away? But the&s;e words made the little wild creature fly &s;till fa&s;ter. Cecilia pur|&s;ued;
<PB N="68" REF="79">but, as &s;he was le&s;s u&s;ed to running, could not po&s;|&s;ibly come up with her. Luckily the little &s;tranger had turned up another walk; and that in which Cecilia was led directly to the garden gate. Cecilia, as &s;en&s;ible as &s;he was pretty, &s;lipped &s;oftly along by a clo&s;e hedge that bordered the walk, and reached the end of it ju&s;t as the little girl was going to pa&s;s by. She caught hold of her unawares, crying, Ah! now you are my pri&s;oner. Oh! I have you fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you cannot e&s;cape now. The little girl &s;truggled to get out of her hands. Do not be ill-natured, &s;aid Ceci|lia to her; if you knew how well I mean to u&s;e you, I am &s;ure you would not be &s;o &s;hy. Come, my good child, come along with me for a moment. The&s;e friendly words, and &s;till more, the gentle tone of voice with which they were pronounced, encouraged the little &s;tran|ger, and &s;he followed Cecilia into a &s;ummer-hou&s;e that was near.</P>

<P>Yes, if I was his only child; but there are five of us, and we all eat heartily; and then one wants a frock, and another a jacket, and that makes my father quite at a le&s;s what to do.

<P>Next morning Marian &s;lipped into the garden again. Cecilia gave her &s;ome gingerbread that &s;he had bought for her. Marian did not fail to come every day, and Cecilia thought of nothing but new dainties to give her. When her pocket-money was out, &s;he begged her mama to order her &s;omething out of the pantry, and her mother con&s;ented with plea&s;ure. It happened however, one day, that Cecilia received an an&s;wer which grieved her.

<P>I know that you never tell &s;tories, but I con|fe&s;s that I can hardly believe what you &s;ay now. I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the wry faces that my Cecilia would make in eating her bread quite dry, without butter or &s;weet|meats.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, mama, do not be angry, but ye&s;terday I had a mind to try. Being all alone in the garden, I took off my &s;hoes and &s;tockings to walk barefoot. I felt my feet &s;adly hurt, but &s;till I walked on. At la&s;t I &s;truck again&s;t a &s;tone. Oh! that did &s;o pain me, that I went back as &s;oftly as I could, and put on my &s;hoes and
<PB N="73" REF="84">&s;tockings, and I promi&s;ed fairly never to walk barefoot again. My poor Marian! yet &s;he is &s;o all the &s;ummer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how comes it, then, that you cannot eat dry bread, nor walk barefoot as &s;he does?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cec.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thing is, perhaps, that I am not u&s;ed to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, if &s;he u&s;es her&s;elf, like you, to eat &s;weet things, and to wear &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and af|terwards if the brown bread &s;hould go again&s;t her, and &s;he &s;hould not be able to walk barefoot, do you think that you would have done her any great &s;ervice?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, I know many others be&s;ide. There are two, e&s;pecially, ju&s;t by in the village, that have neither father nor mother.</P>

<P>But if you give Marian every thing, if you feed her with bi&s;cuits and &s;weetmeats, while you let the re&s;t die with hunger, will there be much ju&s;tice and hu|manity in that management?</P>

<P>Yes, I am convinced of that. But then would &s;he fall into indigence again, and perhaps be obliged to do &s;ome di&s;graceful action, in order to live well and dre&s;s well as before. Who would then have the blame of her ruin?</P>

<P>Oh! every body would point at her. How &s;hall we do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. A.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were in your place, I would be &s;paring in my amu&s;ements for &s;ome time, and when I had &s;aved a little money, would lay it out in buying whatever was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for her. The &s;tuff that poor children wear, is not very expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Cecilia followed her mother's advice. Marian came feldomer indeed to &s;ee her about breakfa&s;t time, but Ce|cilia made her other pre&s;ents that were more u&s;eful. At one time &s;he would give her an apron, another time a petti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;he paid the &s;choolma&s;ter of the village &s;o much a month for her &s;chooling, that &s;he might im|prove her&s;elf perfectly in reading. Marian was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the&s;e kindne&s;&s;es that &s;he grew every day more tenderly attached to Cecilia. She came frequently to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and would &s;ay to her, Have you any commands for me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Is there any work that I can do for you? And when|ever Cecilia gave her an opportunity of doing any &s;light &s;ervice, it was plea&s;ing to &s;ee with what joy Marian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erted her&s;elf to oblige her. One day &s;he came to the garden gate to wait for Cecilia's coming down, but Ce|cilia did not come. Marian came back again, but could not &s;ee Cecilia. She returned two days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but no Cecilia appeared. Poor Marian was di&s;con&s;olate, not finding her benefactre&s;s. Ah! &s;aid &s;he, can it be that &s;he does not love me? I have perhaps vexed her without meaning it. I am &s;ure, if I knew in what, I would a&s;k her pardon, for I could not live without loving her. Ju&s;t then Mrs. Allen's maid came out. Marian &s;topped her. Where is Mi&s;s Cecilia? a&s;ked &s;he. Mi&s;s Cecilia? re|plied the woman. She has, perhaps, not long to live. I am afraid that &s;he is in her la&s;t moments. She has the &s;mall-pox. O dear heart! cried Marian, I won't let her die: and running to the &s;tairs, &s;he flies up into Mrs. Allen's chamber. Madam, &s;aid &s;he, for God's &s;ake tell
<PB N="75" REF="86">me where is Mi&s;s Cecilia? I mu&s;t &s;ee her. Mrs. Allen would have &s;topped Marian, but the door being half open, &s;he had a &s;ight of Cecilia's bed, and was alrea|dy by her &s;ide. Cecilia was in a violent fever, alone, and very low in &s;pirits; for all her little acquaintances had for&s;aken her. Marian, drowned in tears, took her hand, &s;queezed it in hers, and ki&s;&s;ed it; &s;aying, Ah! is it thus I find you! Do not die, I pray you; what would become of me, were I to lo&s;e you? I will &s;tay with you night and day. I will watch over you, and &s;erve you; will you allow me? Cecilia, &s;queezing her hand, &s;ignified to her that &s;he would do her a plea&s;ure in &s;taying con|&s;tantly with her. Marian was now become, with the con&s;ent of Mrs. Allen, Cecilia's nur&s;e; and performed this part to admiration. She had a &s;mall bed made up for her clo&s;e be&s;ide her little &s;ick friend, and never left her a moment. On the &s;lighte&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of pain from Cecilia, Marian ro&s;e immediately to know what &s;he wanted. She gave her, with her own hands, the medi|cines ordered her by the phy&s;icians. Sometimes &s;he would go and gather bulru&s;hes, to amu&s;e her by making hand&s;ome little ru&s;h ba&s;kets while &s;he looked on. Some|times &s;he would tumble all Mrs. Allen's library over, to find pictures for her in the books. She exerted her ima|gination in &s;earch of every thing that was capable of diverting Cecilia from the &s;en&s;e of her illne&s;s. Cecilia had her eyes clo&s;ed by the di&s;order for near a week. This time appeared to her very tedious! but Marian told her &s;tories of what happened in the village; and as &s;he had profited well by her le&s;&s;ons at &s;chool, read to her what|ever &s;he thought would give her plea&s;ure. Now and then, too, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible con&s;o|lations. With a little patience &s;he would &s;ay, God al|mighty will have pity upon you, as you have had pity on me. At the&s;e words &s;he would weep, then quickly drying her eyes, Will you let me &s;ing you a pretty &s;ong to divert you! Cecilia had only to make a &s;ign, and Ma|rian would &s;ing her all the &s;ongs that &s;he had learned from the young country maids round about. Thus the time pa&s;&s;ed over, without hanging heavy on Cecilia. At length by degrees her health was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed: &s;he could open her eyes again: her lowne&s;s of &s;pirits left her: the pock dried up, and her appetite returned. Her face was
<PB N="76" REF="87">&s;till covered with red &s;pots. Marian &s;eemed to look at her with more plea&s;ure than ever, while &s;he thought how narrowly &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed lo&s;ing her. Cecilia on the other hand regarded her with equal tenderne&s;s. How &s;hall I be able to pay you, &s;he would &s;ay, to my &s;atisfaction, for all that you have done for me? She a&s;ked her mama in what manner &s;he might recompen&s;e her tender and faithful nur&s;e. Mrs. Allen, who was almo&s;t be&s;ide her&s;elf with joy to &s;ee her dear child re&s;tored to health after &s;o dan|gerous an illne&s;s, an&s;wered her, Leave it to me. I &s;hall take the charge of acquitting both your obligations and mine to her. She gave private orders to have a complete &s;uit of clothes made for Marian, and Cecilia undertook to try it on her the fir&s;t day that &s;he &s;hould be allowed to go down into the garden. It was a day of rejoicing through the whole hou&s;e. Mrs. Allen and all her family were tran&s;ported with gladne&s;s at the recovery of Cecilia. Cecilia was delighted that &s;he had it in her power to re|compen&s;e Marian: and Marian was out of her wits with joy to behold Cecilia once more in the &s;ame &s;pot where their acquaintance had commenced, and be&s;ides, to find her&s;elf new clad from head to foot.</P>

<P>MR. Churchill was returning home one day on hor&s;e|back, after taking a ride about his own e&s;tate. As he pa&s;&s;ed by the wall of a burying-ground belonging to a &s;mall village, he heard the groans of a per&s;on on the other &s;ide. This worthy gentleman had a heart too full of compa&s;&s;ion to he&s;itate in flying to the relief of the unfortunate per&s;on whom he heard groan. He alighted, and giving his hor&s;e to the &s;ervant who followed him, &s;prung over the enclo&s;ure of the burying-ground. He &s;tood on tiptoe, and looking all round, at length per|ceived in a corner, at the farthe&s;t end, a grave covered with earth that was &s;till quite fre&s;h. Upon this grave lay, at his full length, a child about five years old, who was weeping. Mr. Churchill approached him with looks
<PB N="77" REF="88">of kindne&s;s, and &s;aid to him, What do&s;t thou do there, my little friend?</P>

She was &s;o well the other day, when &s;he le&s;t me with old Su&s;an our neighbour; &s;he told me &s;he was to come back, but &s;he does not come. My father is gone away too, and my little brother, and now the other little boys of the town won't have me.</P>

<P>I do not know; but when I want to go along with them, they drive me away and leave me by my&s;elf. And they &s;ay naughty things, too, about my father and mother. That is what vexes me mo&s;t of all. O mammy get up, get up!</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill's eyes filled with tears. You &s;ay that your father is gone away, and your brother too; where are they gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know where my father is; and my lit|tle brother went away ye&s;terday to another town. There came a gentleman all in black, ju&s;t like our par&s;on, and took him away.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where do you live now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>With our neighbour Su&s;an. I am to be there until my mother comes back, as &s;he promi&s;ed me. I love my other mammy Su&s;an very well; but
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the grave</HI>)</STAGE> I love my mammy that is here a great deal better. O mother, mother! why do you lie &s;o long? when will you get up?</P>

<P>Well then, I will lie down here, and &s;leep by her. Ah! I &s;aw her when they put her into a great che&s;t to carry her away. Oh! how white &s;he was! and how cold! I will lie down here and &s;leep by her.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill could no longer refrain from tears. He &s;tooped down, took the child up in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing him tenderly, &s;aid, What is your name, my poor little fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>They call me Jackey when I am good, and when I am a bad boy they call me you Jack.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89">Mr. Churchill, though in tears, &s;miled at this an&s;wer. Will you take me to Su&s;an? Oh yes, yes, Sir, an&s;wered the child; and running before Mr. Churchill as fa&s;t as his little legs could go, conducted him to Su&s;an's door. Su&s;an was not a little &s;urprized on &s;eeing a gentleman enter her cottage with little Jack, who pointing to her, and running to hide his face in her lap, &s;aid, That is &s;he; that is my other mammy. She knew not what to think of &s;o extraordinary a vi&s;it. Mr. Churchill, how|ever, did not leave her long in &s;u&s;pence. He expre&s;&s;ed to her the &s;ituation in which he had found the child, and the compa&s;&s;ion that he felt for him; and at the &s;ame time reque&s;ted her to favour him with every information con|cerning the parents of little Jack. Su&s;an bade him be &s;eated, and placing her&s;elf clo&s;e by him, began thus. The father of this child is a &s;hoe-maker, who&s;e hou&s;e joins mine. He is an hone&s;t, &s;ober, laborious man, un|der thirty, and a comely per&s;on. His wife was a hand|&s;ome woman, but did not get her health well. Withal &s;he was very careful, and a good hou&s;ewi&s;e. They were married about &s;even years ago, lived va&s;tly well together, and would have made the happie&s;t couple in the world, if they had been a little better in their affairs. John had nothing but his trade, and Margaret being left an orphan, brought her hu&s;band only a little money that &s;he had &s;av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the &s;ervice of a worthy clergyman, the curate of the next pari&s;h. This little &s;um was laid out in buying a bed, and a few other articles of hou&s;hold furniture, with a &s;mall &s;tock of leather for his work. In &s;pite of their poverty, they contrived to maintain them&s;elves during the fir&s;t years of their marriage, by dint of labour and good management. But children came on, and then be|gan their difficulties. Yet &s;till they might have made it out by doubling their indu&s;try, if misfortunes had not happened to them. Poor Margaret who had worked in the fields every day during the hay time, to bring home &s;ome money at night to her hu&s;band, fell &s;ick of fatigue, and continued &s;o all the harve&s;t and all winter. Phy|&s;ick is very expen&s;ive, and then be&s;ides, the work did not go on &s;o well, becau&s;e John's cu&s;tomers left him one by one, as they were afraid of being ill &s;erved in a hou&s;e where there was a &s;ick wife. At la&s;t Margaret grew bet|ter, but her hu&s;band's bu&s;ine&s;s declined. He was obliged
<PB N="79" REF="90">to borrow money to pay the apothecary; and having lo&s;t all his cu&s;tomers, he was now quite out of work. At the &s;ame time Margaret could earn nothing; her &s;trength was &s;o much reduced that nobody would give her em|ployment. Be&s;ides, the rent of their hou&s;e, and the in|tere&s;t of the money that they had borrowed, came heavily upon them. They were obliged more than once to &s;uffer hunger, and thought them&s;elves very happy when they had a mor&s;el of bread to give to their children. At the&s;e words little Jack withdrew into a corner, and began to &s;ob. With all this it happened that their hard-hearted landlord, &s;eeing them not able to pay the rent of the two winter quarters, threatened John to put him in ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> They begged hard of him to have patience until the hay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> making came on, becau&s;e then they could earn &s;ome|thing by working in the fields; but neither their entr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor their tears could &s;often him, though he is the riche&s;t man in the place. It was with much ado that he al|lowed them a month's delay; but he &s;wore that if at the end of that time he was not paid the whole, he would &s;ell their furniture and put John in pri&s;on. Their hou&s;e was now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cture of melancholy and patient di&s;tre&s;s, capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oftening a heart of &s;tone. You may believe me, Sir; I have often been grieved to the &s;oul on hear|ing the complaints of the&s;e good neighbours, and not being able to relieve them. I went once my&s;elf to their landlord, and prayed him to have compa&s;&s;ion on their extremity. I offered to pawn to him all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the world. But it was to no purpo&s;e. You are no better than they are, an&s;wered he; this it is to have &s;uch tra&s;h of tenants as you are all together. Ah! Sir,
<STAGE>(<HI>here the tears trickled down Su&s;an's checks</HI>)</STAGE> I bore this reproach patiently, that I might not provoke him &s;till more; but oh! how I &s;uffered in being no more than a poor widow, and in not being able to afford the lea&s;t comfort to tho&s;e worthy people! How much good the rich might do if they had the &s;ame inclination as the poor! But to return to our unfortunate neighbours; I advi&s;ed Margaret to make known her di&s;tre&s;&s;es to the clergyman with whom &s;he had lived &s;ome years as an hone&s;t and worthy &s;er|vant, and to beg of him to advance her &s;ome money. She an&s;wered me, that &s;he would &s;peak about it to her hu&s;band, but that &s;he could hardly think of doing &s;o,
<PB N="80" REF="91">becau&s;e the carate might imagine that they were reduced to want through their own bad management. Three days ago &s;he brought me her two children as &s;he u&s;ed to do, and begged me to take care of them till the evening. She intended to go to a neighbouring village, and try if &s;he could have &s;ome hemp from the weaver to &s;pin, in order to clear her debt. She could never bring her&s;elf to go before the clergyman her old ma&s;ter; but her hu&s;band was to go in her &s;tead, and he had &s;et off the &s;ame day. I took charge of the children with plea&s;ure, for I loved them very well, having been at the birth of them. Mar|garet, as &s;he was going, cla&s;ped them to her brea&s;t and ki&s;&s;ed them, as if it were the la&s;t time that eyer &s;he &s;hould &s;ee them. Her eyes were &s;wimming in tears, and &s;he &s;aid to the elde&s;t, Jackey, I am to be back very &s;oon, and then I'll come and &s;etch you. She took me by the hand, thanked me for being &s;o good as to look after her chil|dren, ki&s;&s;ed them once more, and departed. A little time after, I heard an odd &s;ort of noi&s;e in her hou&s;e, that went thump, as it were; but imagining that &s;he was gone out, I &s;uppo&s;ed it might be only the inner door clapping to, and &s;o did not think any more about it. Well, the evening came on, it grew dark night, and I &s;aw nothing or my neighbour. I thought I would go to her hou&s;e, and &s;ee it &s;he was gone in to lay her hemp down before &s;he came to fetch the children. I found the door open, and went in. But O heavens! how was I &s;truck on behold|ing Margaret &s;tretched at her length, &s;tone dead, at the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the &s;tairs. As for me, I &s;tood motionle&s;s, and as cold as a &s;tone. I did not know what to do. At length after trying in vain to recover her, I ran to the &s;urgeon who came, and feeling her pul&s;e, &s;hook his head and &s;ent directly for the coroner. They held an inque&s;t, the &s;urgeon being pre&s;ent, to examine how &s;he came by her death; and they brought it in that &s;he mu&s;t have died &s;uddenly, or that having fallen into a fit, and not being able to call for help, &s;he expired in that condition. I can ea&s;ily imagine how it happened. She had returned into her own hou&s;e to go up to the lo&s;t for the bag that was to hold her hemp, and as her eyes were &s;till dimmed with tears, &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed her &s;tep in coming down, and fallen from the top of the &s;tairs, with her head foremo&s;t, on the ground. The bag that was be&s;ide her &s;hewed it
<PB N="81" REF="92">plainly. Yet for all that, the coroner thought otherwi&s;e. So the body was ordered to be buried the next morning before day-light in a corner of the church-yard, and an enquiry to be made after John, to know what was be|come of him. I propo&s;ed to the pari&s;h officers to keep the two children my&s;elf; for though I find it hard enough to live, yet, thought I, the bounteous God knows that I am a helple&s;s widow; and if the&s;e two children come to my charge, will &s;urely a&s;&s;i&s;t me to feed them. The younger brother to this did not &s;tay long with me. Ye&s;terday of all days, and even not long after Margaret had been buried, did the worthy curate her old ma&s;ter come by chance to &s;ee her. He knocked for &s;ome time at her door, and as nobody opened, he came to my win|dow and a&s;ked me what was become of John John&s;on the &s;hoemaker that lived in the next hou&s;e. I told him that if he would give him&s;elf the trouble to &s;tep in a mo|ment, I had many things to tell him. He came in, and &s;at down there, ju&s;t where you are. I told him all that had happened, which made him &s;hed tears. Afterwards I told him that John had &s;ome thoughts of applying to him in his di&s;tre&s;s. He &s;eemed &s;urprized, and a&s;&s;ured me po&s;itively that he had not &s;een John. The two children came up to him, and he fondled them a good deal. Little Jack a&s;ked him if he could not awake his mother, who had been a long time a&s;leep. The tears came into the good curate's eyes when he heard the child talk &s;o; and he &s;aid to me, Good woman, I will &s;end to-morrow for the&s;e two little boys, and I will keep them at home with me. If their father returns, and &s;hould be able to bring them up, I &s;hall re&s;tore them to him whenever he requires it. In the mean time I will take charge of their educa|tion. All this was not very agreeable to me; for I love the&s;e little innocents as if I were their mother, and it would have given me &s;ome pain to &s;ee them &s;natched from me &s;o &s;oon. Doctor, &s;aid I to him, I cannot con&s;ent to part with the&s;e children. I am u&s;ed to them, and they are u&s;ed to me.&mdash;Well then, my good woman, you mu&s;t give me one of them, and I will leave you the other, &s;ince he is likely to be &s;o happy with you; and from time to time I &s;hall &s;end you &s;omething towards his maintenance. I could not refu&s;e the good par&s;on this. He a&s;ked little Jack if he &s;hould not like to go with him. What, there
<PB N="82" REF="93">where my mother is? &s;aid Jack; oh yes, with all my heart.&mdash;No, my little man, I do not mean there! but to my hand&s;ome hou&s;e, and my hand&s;ome garden.&mdash;No, no, let me &s;tay here with Su&s;an. I'll go every day to where my mother is. I would rather go there than to your hand&s;ome garden. The good gentleman did not chu&s;e to trouble the child more, who had gone to hide him&s;elf be|hind the curtains of my bed. He told me that he would &s;end his man for the younge&s;t, who would give me more trouble than the other; and at his going, left me &s;ome money for this child. This, Sir, is all that I have to in|form you of the parents of little Jack. What doubles my unea&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent is, that John does not return, and that a report goes in the pari&s;h, that he is gone to join a gang of &s;mugglers, and that his wife killed her&s;elf for grief. The&s;e &s;tories have gained &s;uch ground in the village, that there is not one, even to the children, but talks of them; and whenever my poor Jack would go among&s;t the other boys, they drive him away, and are ready to beat him. The poor child is quite dull, and never &s;tirs out now, unle&s;s to go to his mother's grave.</P>
<P>Mr. Churchill had li&s;tened in &s;ilence to Su&s;an's account, and was deeply affected by it. Little Jack was come again clo&s;e up to her. He looked at her with fondne&s;s, and called her &s;everal times his mother. At length Mr. Charchill &s;aid to Su&s;an, My worthy woman, you have conducted your&s;elf very generou&s;ly towards this unfortu|nate family: God will not fail to reward you for it.</P>

Ah! if I could have done more than I did!

<P>In the fir&s;t place, I am fond of the &s;pot where I was born, and have lived &s;o long; then again, I could not &s;uit my&s;elf to the bu&s;tle of a great hou&s;e, nor to the &s;ight of &s;o many folks in a family; neither am I u&s;ed to ea&s;e or nice living.

<P>Well then, be it &s;o. I do not wi&s;h that what I mean well &s;hould make you unhappy. I will leave little Jack with you, &s;ince you are &s;o well together.

I &s;hall &s;end you every month what may be &s;ufficient for your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I will come fre|quently to &s;ee you; and my vi&s;it &s;hall be as much on your account as his.</P>
<P>Su&s;an lifted up her eyes to heaven, and implored its favours on Mr. Churchill. She then &s;aid to the child, Come hither, Jackey, and a&s;k this gentleman's ble&s;&s;ing; he will be your father now. The little boy did &s;o; but &s;aid pre&s;ently to Su&s;an, How can he be my daddy? he wears no apron. Mr. Churchill &s;miled at this innocent que&s;tion of little Jack, and throwing his pur&s;e on the table, Farewel, &s;aid he, generous Su&s;an! farewel my little friend! it &s;hall not be long before you &s;ee me again. He then left them, and mounting his hor&s;e, took the road that led to the pari&s;h where the Curate lived who had taken home the younger orphan. He found the Cu|rate reading a letter, on which he now and then &s;hed tears. After the fir&s;t civilities, Mr. Churchill explained the &s;ubject of his vi&s;it to the worthy divine, and a&s;ked him if he knew what was become of the father of tho&s;e two unfortunate children. Sir, an&s;wered the Curate, it is not a quarter of an hour &s;ince I received this letter, written by him to his wi&s;e. It was enclo&s;ed in one to me, and con|rains a &s;mall draft for the u&s;e of his wife: he reque&s;ts me to deliver it to her, and to con&s;ole her for his ab&s;ence. As &s;he is dead, I have opened the letter: here it is; be &s;o kind as to read it. Mr. Churchill eagerly took the letter, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear wife,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I cannot think without unea&s;ine&s;s on the trouble that my ab&s;ence mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned you. But let me inform you of what has happened to me. Being on my way to
<PB N="85" REF="96">the clergyman's hou&s;e, I began to think in this manner: Of what u&s;e will it be to me to go begging thus? I &s;hall only get rid of one debt by contracting another, and &s;hall gain nothing but the unea&s;ine&s;s of thinking how to pay it. I that am yet young, and can work, to go and a&s;k &s;o much money? I &s;hall be taken either for an idle fellow, or a drinker. The par&s;on to be &s;ure married us, and loves us as his children; but if he were to take a di&s;like, and refu&s;e me! or on the other hand, if he were not able to relieve us! And then &s;uppo&s;ing that he advanced me the &s;um for a year, &s;hould I be &s;ure to have it in my power to pay him? and if I did not, &s;hould not I be as bad as a thief? It would be defrauding him. Thus I rea&s;oned, my dear Margaret, and began afterwards to think how I might extricate our affairs by acting in a ju&s;ter manner. I often &s;ighed and put up my prayers to heaven. At la&s;t it came into my head all at once, thought I, you are &s;till a young man, you are &s;tout and able bo|died, what harm would there be if you went on board of a man of war for a few years? You can read and write, and ca&s;t accounts pretty well. You may &s;till make a for|tune for your wife and children; at lea&s;t you may clear all your debts. Con&s;ider that if you have good &s;ucce&s;s, and happen on &s;ome prize money, it will be the making of your wife. For above half an hour the&s;e were my thoughts, when at la&s;t I &s;aw part of a pre&s;s-gang at a di&s;|tance behind me. They &s;oon came up with me, and a&s;ked me whence I came, where I was bound, and whether I would go as a volunteer? I &s;eemed at fir&s;t not to like the &s;ea, but they que&s;tioned me again, and promi&s;ed me a bounty of five pounds. I told them that for &s;o much I would &s;erve during the war. Done, &s;aid they. Come along with us, my lad, and the affair &s;hall be &s;ettled pre|&s;ently. They brought me before the lieutenant who a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions; and I an&s;wered them &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction that he advanced my bounty immediately. And thus, my dear Margaret, I have entered the king's &s;ervice to clear my affairs. I &s;end you a draft for the five pounds. I would not keep a penny of it. Pay the forty &s;hillings that we owe, and what&s;oever el&s;e may be due. With the remainder do the be&s;t you can to keep hou&s;e. Live well, that you may recover your &s;trength. Clothe our children, and &s;end them &s;oon to &s;chool. I
<PB N="86" REF="97">know that although you are handy and careful, you will not be able to make this &s;um la&s;t very long. But pa|tience! my wages are 17s. 6d. <HI>per</HI> month; I will try if I cannot find a way to forward part of them to you at the end of a few months; and whenever we arrive in har|bour, I &s;hall a&s;k leave to go on &s;hore on purpo&s;e to &s;ee you. My dear Margaret, do not grieve; tru&s;t in God. We may &s;oon have a peace. I will then return to you, and we &s;hall begin hou&s;ekeeping together once more. My lieutenant has promi&s;ed me to write to our church|wardens, that the pari&s;h may not be unea&s;y on my ac|count. Bring up our children carefully; make them &s;tick to home, and be fond of work. Pray with them every day, and teach them their duty, that they may grow up to be hone&s;t men; for you are very capable of in&s;tructing them well. Live in the fear of the Lord, pray to him for me, and I will pray to him in your be|half. An&s;wer me &s;oon. You have only to give your letter to the doctor, he knows be&s;t how to direct it. Re|member me to the two boys. Tell Jack that if he is a good lad, I will bring him home &s;omething at my return. God be prai&s;ed for all things. Continue &s;till to love me, who remain</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever faithful hu&s;band,
JOHN JOHNSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Churchill's eyes were filled with tears while he read this letter. When he had fini&s;hed it, This man, cried he, may truly be called a good hu&s;band, a good father, and an hone&s;t man! Sir, there is a real plea&s;ure in contributing to the happine&s;s of &s;uch excellent people. As to John's debts, I will pay them and will enable him be&s;ides to take up his trade again decently. Let this money remain for the children who have co&s;t their father dear; and let it be divided between them as &s;oon as they are capable of doing for them&s;elves. Till then keep it in your hands, and &s;peak to them at times of it as of the &s;tronge&s;t proof of a father's affection. I will pay you intere&s;t for it, to be joined with the capital; for I wi&s;h to have &s;ome part in this &s;acred depo&s;it. The worthy curate was too much affected to be able to an&s;wer Mr. Churchill. The latter under&s;tood the force of his &s;ilence, and &s;queezing him by the hand, took his leave.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="98">All his de&s;igns in favour of John have been executed. John, being &s;afe returned, enjoys an ea&s;ine&s;s of cir|cum&s;tances which he never experienced before, and would be the happie&s;t of men, but for his grief for the lo&s;s of Margaret. He finds no other comfort, than in talking of her con&s;tantly with Su&s;an. This worthy wo|man looks upon her&s;elf as his &s;i&s;ter, and as a mother to his children. Little Jack never lets a &s;ingle day pa&s;s without going to his mother's grave. He has made &s;o good a u&s;e of Mr. Churchill's genero&s;ity, in improving him&s;elf, that this excellent gentleman has it in view to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the mo&s;t advantageous manner. He has taken the &s;ame care of John's younger &s;on, and he never mounts his hor&s;e without recalling to mind this affecting incident. Whenever he meets any &s;ubject of chagrin, he goes to &s;ee the per&s;ons whom he has made happy, and always returns home relieved of every unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation.</P>

<HEAD>THE MASONS ON THE LADDER.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Dormer was walking one day with little Archibald his &s;on, in one of the public &s;quares, they &s;topped before a hou&s;e that was building, and which was rai&s;ed as high as the &s;econd &s;tory. Archibald re|marked a number of workmen placed one above another upon the rounds of a ladder, who were moving their arms up and down &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. This appearance excited his curio&s;ity. Papa, cried he, what game are tho&s;e men playing? Let us go a little nearer to the foot of the ladder.</P>
<P>They placed them&s;elves in a &s;pot where there was no danger, and ob&s;erved a man go and take a large &s;tone from a heap, and carry it to another man placed on the fir&s;t round of the ladder; and he, rai&s;ing his arms above his head, handed the &s;tone to a third who was placed above him, who, by the &s;ame operation, pa&s;&s;ed it up to a fourth; and thus, from one hand to another, the &s;tone very &s;oon reached the &s;caffold, where the ma&s;ons were ready to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="99">What do you think of this &s;ight? &s;aid Mr. Dormer to his &s;on. Why are &s;o many per&s;ons employed in building this hou&s;e? Would it not be better that one man &s;ingly &s;hould work at it, and that the re&s;t &s;hould go, and each build for him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Very true, indeed, papa, an&s;wered Archibald! there would then be many more hou&s;es than there are.</P>
<P>Do you con&s;ider well, &s;aid Mr. Dormer, what you now &s;ay? Do you know how many arts and trades are con|cerned in forming &s;uch a hou&s;e as this?

<PB N="101" REF="112">Mrs. Carey, were lavi&s;hed on him alone; and the &s;er|vants, to gain the favour of their mi&s;tre&s;s, were &s;tudious to flatter him in all his fancies. Pri&s;cilla, on the con|trary, from her mother's coldne&s;s, found her&s;elf the more &s;lighted by the re&s;t of the family. Far from anticipating her wi&s;hes, they even neglected her real wants. She would &s;hed floods of tears, when &s;he found her&s;elf alone and for&s;aken by every body, but never &s;uffered the &s;lighte&s;t complaint or mark of di&s;content to e&s;cape her in the pre&s;ence of others. In vain did &s;he endeavour, by a con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of her duty, by her mildne&s;s and her attentions, to make amends in her mother's opinion for the deficiency of her beauty: the qualities of her mind were unnoticed by eyes accu&s;tomed only to look on out|ward advantages. Mrs. Carey, not much affected by the marks of tenderne&s;s which Pri&s;cilla &s;hewed her, &s;eemed, particularly &s;ince her hu&s;band's death, to view her with a kind of di&s;gu&s;t. She was continually chiding her, and required perfections in her which could not even be ex|pected from an under&s;tanding far more advanced.</P>
<P>This unju&s;t mother fell &s;ick. Marcus appeared &s;trongly touched at her &s;ufferings; but Pri&s;cilla, who, in the &s;oftened looks and languid countenance of her mother, thought &s;he perceived an abatement of her accu&s;tomed &s;everity, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her brother in her care and vigi|lance. Attentive to her mother's &s;lighte&s;t wants, &s;he exerted all her penetration to di&s;cover them, that &s;he might &s;pare her even the trouble of expre&s;&s;ing them. While her mother's illne&s;s had the lea&s;t appearance of danger, &s;he never quitted her pillow. Entreaties, or even commands, could not prevail upon her to take a moment's repo&s;e. At length Mrs. Carey recovered. This happy circum&s;tance di&s;&s;ipated the apprehen&s;ions of Pri&s;cilla; but her &s;orrows began afre&s;h, when &s;he &s;aw her mama rea&s;&s;ume her u&s;ual &s;everity towards her.</P>
<P>One day, when Mrs. Carey was di&s;cour&s;ing with her children of the pains that &s;he had &s;uffered during her ill|ne&s;s, and was thanking them for the tender and earne&s;t affection which their cares for her had te&s;tified, "My dear children, added &s;he, you may both a&s;k of me whatever will give you mo&s;t plea&s;ure. I promi&s;e to grant it to you, if your de&s;ires are within the extent of my fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="113">What do you wi&s;h, Marcus? &s;aid &s;he fir&s;t to her &s;on.&mdash; A watch and a cane, mama, replied he.&mdash;You &s;hall have them to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>And you, Pri&s;cilla?&mdash;Me, mama? me? an&s;wered &s;he, trembling, I have nothing to wi&s;h for, if you love me.</P>
<P>That is not an an&s;wer. You &s;hall have your recom|pen&s;e too, mi&s;s. What would you wi&s;h? Speak.</P>
<P>Though Pri&s;cilla had been accu&s;tomed to this tone of &s;everity, yet &s;he felt it more &s;en&s;ibly on this occa&s;ion than ever &s;he had done before. She threw her&s;elf at her mo|ther's feet, looked up to her with eyes all drowned in tears, and &s;uddenly hiding her face with both her hands, li&s;ped out the&s;e words, "Give me only two ki&s;&s;es, &s;uch as you give my brother."</P>
<P>Mrs. Carey's heart melted at the&s;e words, and &s;he felt tho&s;e &s;entiments of affection to her daughter now revive which &s;he had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Taking her up in her arms, &s;he cla&s;ped her to her brea&s;t and loaded her with ki&s;&s;es. Pri&s;cilla, who for the fir&s;t time received her mother's care&s;&s;es, gave a loo&s;e to the effu&s;ions of her joy and love. She ki&s;&s;ed her cheeks, her eyes, her brea&s;t, her hands: and Marcus, who could not help loving his &s;i&s;ter, mixed his embraces with her's. They all enjoyed a happine&s;s which was not confined to the pre&s;ent mo|ment. Mrs. Carey repaid with intere&s;t to Pri&s;cilla that affection which &s;he had before withheld from her, and Pri&s;cilla returned it with new marks of tenderne&s;s. Nor was Marcus in the lea&s;t jealous on this account, but re|joiced in his &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s. He &s;oon reaped the re|ward of &s;o generous a behaviour. The natural goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition having been a little injured by the weakne&s;s and doating fondne&s;s of his mother, he gave way in youth to many little indi&s;cretions which would have lo&s;t him her heart, but Pri&s;cilla always found means to excu&s;e him to her. The &s;en&s;ible advice too which &s;he gave him completed the reform of his manners; and they all three experienced that there is no true happine&s;s in a family without the mo&s;t cerdial union between bro|thers and &s;i&s;ters and the mo&s;t lively and equal affection between parents and children.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAMB.</HEAD>
<P>LITTLE Flora, the daughter of a poor countryman, was &s;eated one morning by the &s;ide of the road, holding on her lap a porringer of milk for her breakfa&s;t, in which &s;he &s;opped a few &s;lices of coar&s;e black bread. Ju&s;t then a farmer was pa&s;&s;ing the road, who had in his cart about a &s;core of lambs that he was going to &s;ell at the market. The&s;e poor creatures, crowded one upon the other, with their feet tied together and their heads hang|ing down, filled the air with plaintive bleatings, which pierced the heart of Flora, but were heard by the farmer with an ear of unconcern.</P>
<P>When he was come up oppo&s;ite to the little country girl he threw down before her a lamb which he was carrying acro&s;s his &s;houlder. "There, my girl, &s;aid he, is a good-for-nothing bea&s;t that has ju&s;t died, and made me five &s;hillings the poorer. Take it, if you will, and make a &s;tew of it."</P>
<P>Flora quitted her breakfa&s;t, laid down her porringer and her bread, and taking up the lamb, began to examine it with looks of compa&s;&s;ion. "But, &s;aid &s;he immediately, why &s;hould I pity you? To-day or to-morrow they would have run a great knife through your throat, while now you have nothing more to fear." While &s;he was &s;peak|ing thus, the lamb revived by the warmth of her arms, opened its eyes a little, made a &s;light motion, and cried <HI>baa</HI> faintly, as if it was calling its mother. It would be difficult to expre&s;s the little girl's joy. She covers the lamb with her apron, and over that with her &s;tuff petti|coat, bends her brea&s;t down towards her lap to warm it &s;till more, and blows with all her force into its no&s;trils and mouth. She felt the poor animal &s;tir by degrees, and at each of its motions &s;he felt her own heart throb. Encouraged by this fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he crumbles &s;ome &s;oft bread into her porringer, and taking it up in her fingers, with &s;ome difficulty forced it between its teeth which were &s;hut fa&s;t. The lamb, which was dying only through hunger, felt it&s;elf a little &s;trengthened by this nouri&s;h|ment. It began now to &s;tretch its limbs, to &s;hake its head, to wag its tail, and to prick up its ears. It had &s;oon &s;trength enough to &s;upport it&s;elf upon its legs, and
<PB N="104" REF="115">then went of its own accord to Flora's porringer, who &s;miled to &s;ee it drink up her breakfa&s;t. In &s;hort, before a quarter of an hour was pa&s;t, it had already played a thou&s;and little gambols.</P>
<P>Flora, tran&s;ported with joy, took it up in her arms, and running to the cottage, &s;hewed it to her mother. Baba (&s;o &s;he named it) became from that moment the object of all her cares. She &s;hared with it the little bread which was given her for her meals, and would not have exchanged it &s;ingly for the large&s;t flock in the neighbour|hood. Baba was &s;o gratefully &s;en&s;ible of her fondne&s;s, that &s;he never quitted Flora a &s;ingle &s;tep: &s;he would come to eat out of her hand, would fri&s;k round her, and when|ever &s;he was obliged to go out without her, would bleat mo&s;t pitifully.</P>
<P>This was not the only recompence with which Heaven repaid Flora's compa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s. Baba brought forth young lambs, and the&s;e others in their turn: &s;o that in a few years after, Flora had a pretty flock that nouri&s;h|ed all her family with their milk, and furni&s;hed them comfortable clothing from their wool.</P>

He then called a &s;ervant and de&s;ired him to &s;weep up the dirt that Martin had left on the floor-cloth with his nailed &s;hoes. Arthur, mean time, held his|&s;ides, laughing at his brother's impertinences.</P>
<P>It was not the &s;ame with Sophia their &s;i&s;ter. In&s;tead of imitating the rudene&s;s of her brothers, &s;he reproved them for it, endeavoured to excu&s;e them to the farmer, and approaching him with looks of good-nature, offered him wine to refre&s;h him&s;elf, made him &s;it down, and took his hat and &s;tick her&s;elf and laid them by. In the mean time Sir John came out of his &s;tudy, and approach|ing farmer Martin in a friendly manner, took him by the hand, a&s;ked how his wife and children were, and what had brought him to town. "Sir, an&s;wered the farmer, I come to pay you my half-year's rent:" and at the &s;ame time he drew out of his pocket a leathern bag full of
<PB N="108" REF="119">money. "You will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, continued he, that I have been &s;omething beyond my time: our roads were &s;o flooded, that I could not carry my corn to market &s;ooner."</P>
<P>"I am not at all di&s;plea&s;ed with you, replied Sir John: I know that you are an hone&s;t man and have no occa&s;ion to be put in mind of your engagements." At the &s;ame time he had a table laid before the farmer, to count the money on. Robert &s;tared at the &s;ight of farmer Martin's guineas, and &s;eemed to look at him with a little more re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When Sir John had counted the farmer's money and found it right, the latter drew out of his great-coat pocket a &s;mall jar of candied fruits. "I have brought &s;omething &s;aid he, for the young folks. Won't you be &s;o good, Sir John, as to let them come out one of the&s;e days, and take a mouthful of the country air with us. I'd try to enter|tain and amu&s;e them too, as well as I could. I have two good &s;tout nags, and would come for them my&s;elf, and take them down in my four-wheeled chai&s;e."</P>
<P>Sir John premi&s;ed to go and &s;ee him, and would have kept him to dinner; but Mr. Martin thanked him for his kind invitation, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf for not being able to accept it, as he had many bargains to make in town, and was in a hurry to return home. Sir John filled his pockets with cakes for his children, thanked him for the pre&s;ent that he had made to his, and having wi&s;hed him good health, as well to &s;upport his fatigues as on his fa|mily's account, &s;aw him down &s;tairs and took his leave.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Sophia, before her brothers, informed her father of the rude reception which they had given to the hone&s;t farmer. Sir John expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;|plea&s;ure at Robert and Arthur, and at the &s;ame time commended Sophia for her conduct. "I &s;ee, &s;aid he ki&s;&s;ing her, that my little Sophia knows how to behave her&s;elf to hone&s;t people."</P>
<P>As it was about breakfa&s;t hour, he opened the farmer's jar of fruits and eat &s;ome of them with his daughter, and they both thought them excellent. Robert and Arthur were at table too, but were not invited to ta&s;te the fruits. They devoured them with their eyes, but Sir John did not &s;eem to ob&s;erve their longings. He re&s;umed his com|mendations of Sophia, and exhorted her never to de&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="120">a per&s;on for the plainne&s;s of his dre&s;s. "For, &s;aid he, if we were to behave politely only to tho&s;e who are well clad, we &s;hould &s;eem to direct our civilities to the dre&s;s, not to the per&s;on who wears it. People in the mo&s;t homely clothing are often the mo&s;t hone&s;t; we have an in&s;tance of it in farmer Martin. He not only by his labour &s;up|ports him&s;elf, his wife and children, but during the&s;e &s;ix years that he is my tenant, he pays his rents &s;o punctually that I have never had the &s;malle&s;t fault to find with him in that re&s;pect. Yes, my dear Sophia, if this man was not &s;o hone&s;t, I could not &s;upply the expence of main|taining you and your brothers. It is he who clothes you and procures you a good education; for it is in clothing you and paying the expences of your in&s;truction that I di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ums which he pays me every half-year."</P>
<P>After the breakfa&s;t was fini&s;hed, he ordered the re|mainder to be locked up in the beau&s;et. Robert and Arthur followed it with de&s;iring eyes and &s;aw plainly that it was not kept for them. In this their father &s;oon confirmed them. "Do not expect, &s;aid he, to ta&s;te the&s;e fruits, either to-day, or any other time. When the farmer who brought them &s;hall have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with you, he will not fail to &s;end you &s;ome."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, is it my fault, if he did not &s;mell well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did he &s;mell, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the dung-heap, in&s;ufferably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence could he have contracted that &s;mell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>From his loading carts with it every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;hould he do then, to get rid of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;hould&mdash;he &s;hould&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;hould, perhaps, not put dung upon his grounds at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is only that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he did not enrich his land, how could he draw a plentiful crop from it? And if he had always bad crops, how could he manage to pay me the rent of his farm?</P>
<P>Robert would have replied, but his father gave him a look in which Arthur and he plainly read his di&s;plea&s;ure. &mdash;The next Sunday, very early, the good farmer was at Sir John Downton's door. He &s;ent up his compliments, and kindly invited him to come and take an excur&s;ion to
<PB N="110" REF="121">his farm. Sir John, plea&s;ed with his hearty obliging manner, would not mortify him by a refu&s;al. Robert and Arthur earne&s;tly entreated their father to make them of the party, and promi&s;ed to behave them&s;elves more civilly. Sir John yielding to their &s;olicitations, they mounted the four-wheeled chai&s;e with joyful looks, and as the farmer had a pair of excellent hor&s;es and drove well, they were at his hou&s;e before they had any &s;u&s;picion of it. Who can de&s;cribe their &s;atisfaction when the chai&s;e &s;topped? Cicely, wife to farmer Martin, appeared with a &s;miling countenance at the wicket, which &s;he opened, and &s;aluted her gue&s;ts; and taking the children in her arms to help them down, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed them, and led them into the yard. All her own children were there in their be&s;t clothes, who welcomed the young gentlemen, &s;a|luting them with great re&s;pect. Sir John would willingly have &s;topped a moment to talk with the little ones and care&s;s them, but Mrs. Martin pre&s;&s;ed him to go in, le&s;t the coffee &s;hould grow cold. It was already poured out, at a table which was covered with a napkin as white as &s;now. The coffee-pot was not of &s;ilver, nor the cups of china, yet every thing was in the neate&s;t order. Robert and Arthur, however, looked at each other &s;lily and would have bur&s;t out in a laugh if they had not feared to offend their father. But Cicely, gue&s;&s;ing their thoughts by the looks which they exchanged, made an apology for their fare, which &s;he confe&s;&s;ed was not &s;o fine as they would have had at their own hou&s;e; however &s;he hoped that they would be &s;atisfied with the cheerful en|tertainment of poor people. With the coffee they had muffins of a delicious ta&s;te. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that Mrs. Martin had u&s;ed all her art in kneading and baking them.</P>
<P>After break&s;a&s;t, the farmer a&s;ked Sir John to look at his orchard and grounds, to which he con&s;ented. Cicely took all the pains imaginable to make this walk agreeable to the children. She &s;hewed them all her flocks which covered the fields, and gave them the prettie&s;t lambs to play with. She then led them to her pigeon-hou&s;e: every thing there was clean and whole&s;ome: there were on the ground two young pigeons which had ju&s;t quitted their ne&s;t, but did not dare as yet to tru&s;t their callow wings. Some of the mothers were &s;itting over their eggs, and
<PB N="111" REF="122">others bu&s;ied in giving nouri&s;hment to their young which had ju&s;t broken the &s;hell. From the pigeon-hou&s;e they went to the bee-hives: Cicely took care that they &s;hould not go too near them, but however &s;he gave them a view of the bees at work.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ights were new to the children, they &s;eemed very much delighted with them: they were even going to take a &s;econd review of them, if farmer Martin's younge&s;t &s;on Tom had not come to inform them that dinner waited. They were &s;erved on pewter and drank out of Delft ware: but Robert and Arthur were &s;till &s;o full of the plea&s;ure of their morning's walk that they were a&s;hamed to indulge their &s;atirical humour; they thought every thing excellent. It is true, Cicely had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in preparing them the be&s;t cheer.</P>
<P>After dinner, Sir John perceived two fiddles hung up again&s;t the wall. What per&s;on here plays tho&s;e in&s;tru|ments? &s;aid he.</P>
<P>My elde&s;t &s;on and I, an&s;wered the farmer; and with|out &s;aying any more, he made a &s;ign to Luke, his &s;on, to take down the fiddles. They played by turns &s;ome old tunes on the fiddles, both &s;prightly and pathetic, of which Sir John expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction in the mo&s;t flattering manner.</P>
<P>As they were going to hang up the in&s;truments again, "Come Robert and Arthur, &s;aid Sir John, it is now your turns. Play us &s;ome of your be&s;t tunes:" and at the &s;ame time he put the fiddles into their hands. But they did not know even how to hold the bow, and their con|fu&s;ion rai&s;ed a general laugh.</P>
<P>Sir John then reque&s;ted the farmer to put the hor&s;es to, that they might return to town. Martin pre&s;&s;ed him &s;trongly to pa&s;s the night with him, but at length yielded to Sir John's excu&s;es.&mdash;"Well, Robert, &s;aid that gen|tleman to his &s;on, as they returned, how do you find your&s;elf after your little journey?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, papa. Tho&s;e good people have done their utmo&s;t to give us every &s;atisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir J. Downton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy to &s;ee you &s;atisfied. But if farmer Martin had not taken &s;o much pains in doing the honours of his hou&s;e, if he had not offered you the &s;malle&s;t refre&s;hment, would you have been as well plea&s;ed with him as you now &s;eem to be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="112" REF="123">
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have thought of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he was an unmannerly clown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Robert, Robert, this hone&s;t man came to our hou&s;e, and far from offering him any refre&s;hment, you made game of him. Which then is the be&s;t bred, you or the farmer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert,</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>blu&s;hing.</HI>)</STAGE> But it is his duty to receive us well. He gains by our lands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call gaining?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean, that he finds it his advantage to gather in the crops of our corn-fields, and the hay of our meadows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right. A farmer has occa&s;ion for all that; but what does he do with the grain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He maintains with it, him&s;elf, his wife and his children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with the hay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He gives it to his hor&s;es to eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he do with his hor&s;es?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>He u&s;es them in plowing the ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, that one part of what he gains from the earth returns to it. But do you believe, that he con&s;umes the remainder with his family and his hor&s;es!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cows have their part of it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arthur.</SPEAKER>
<P>And his &s;heep too, and his pigeons, and his poultry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But are his whole crops con|&s;umed upon his own ground?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I remember to have heard him &s;ay that he took part of them to market, to &s;ell for money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he do with this money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw, la&s;t week, that he brought you a leathern bag full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now &s;ee who draws the greate&s;t profit from my lands, the farmer or I. It is true, he feeds his hor&s;es with hay from the meadows, but his hor&s;es &s;erve to plow the fields which, without the&s;e plowings, would be exhau&s;ted by weeds. He feeds his &s;heep too, and his cows, with the hay; but their dung contributes to make the fallow grounds fruitful. His wife and his children are &s;ed with the corn of the harve&s;ts, but in return they pa&s;s the &s;ummer in weeding the crops, and afterwards, &s;ome in reaping them, &s;ome in thre&s;hing; and the&s;e labours
<PB N="113" REF="124">again turn to my advantage. The re&s;t of his corn and hay he takes to market to &s;ell them, but it is in order to give me the money that he receives. Suppo&s;e that there remains &s;ome part for him&s;elf, is it not fair that he &s;hould have a recompence for his labours? Now therefore, once more tell me, which of us two draws the greate&s;t profits from my lands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now plainly &s;ee that you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without this tenant, &s;hould I have that profit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! there are many tenants to be had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right; but not one more hone&s;t than this. I had formerly let this farm to another who impo|veri&s;hed the land, cut down the trees, and let the out|hou&s;es run to ruin. At quarter-day, he never had any money for me; and when I would expo&s;tulate with him, he &s;hewed me clearly that his whole &s;tock was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer my demand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! the knave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this man were of the &s;ame kind, &s;hould I receive much profit from my e&s;tate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom then am I obliged for what I do receive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee that you owe it to this hone&s;t farmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not therefore our duty to receive a man well who renders us &s;o great &s;ervices?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, you make me &s;ee very plainly that I was wrong.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes a deep &s;ilence en&s;ued. Sir John then re&s;umed the di&s;cour&s;e thus; Robert, why did not you play upon the fiddle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, papa, that I have never learned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then farmer Martin's &s;on knows &s;omething that you do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true. But then, does he under&s;tand Latin as I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you know how to plow? can you drive a team? can you &s;ow wheat, barley, oats, and other grain, or rear a crop of them? Would you know how &s;o much as to fix a hop-pole, or prune a tree, &s;o as to have good fruit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no occa&s;ion to know all that: I am no farmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="114" REF="125">
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if all the people in the world knew no|thing el&s;e but Latin, how would things go then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very ill; we &s;hould have no bread, no vege|tables.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could the world do very well, even though nobody knew Latin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember then all your life what you have ju&s;t &s;een and heard. This farmer &s;o coar&s;ely clad, who &s;aluted and addre&s;&s;ed you in &s;o ru&s;tick a manner; this man is better bred than you, knows much more than you, and things of much greater u&s;e. Therefore you &s;ee how unju&s;t it is to de&s;pi&s;e any one for the plainne&s;s of his dre&s;s or the ungracefulne&s;s of his manner.</P>

<P>I did not tell it to you while we were hid, becau&s;e they would have heard us. But here is the affair: The dear friend Thomas made a pre&s;ent of the &s;quirrel to the dear friend Alicia. The dear friend Alicia received this ugly little bea&s;t with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that &s;he calls it her dear friend Tommy. But I have managed &s;o, that &s;he has not had much amu&s;ement with it.</P>

<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con&s;tantine.</SPEAKER>
<P>They put the &s;quirrel's little hou&s;e on the &s;ummer-hou&s;e bench. I &s;lipped in there, whil&s;t they were taking a tender farewel. I opened the little door,
<PB N="126" REF="137">took the &s;quirrel out, and let him loo&s;e among&s;t the trees. I &s;aw him &s;oon climb up into a tree, and jump from branch to branch. They will be pretty cunning if they ever catch him again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Crumpton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, &s;ir, you have done a very ra&s;|cally action. Did not I forbid you to mole&s;t tho&s;e poor children? and you knew very well the trouble that you were going to cau&s;e to your &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>Was Thomas informed of my intentions when he brought the &s;quirrel?</P>

<P>At lea&s;t Alicia knew them, and was not that di&s;obeying you?</P>

<P>It belonged to me to determine that. She certainly would have &s;hewed me the pre&s;ent that &s;he received; and if I thought it proper, I &s;hould order her to return it. Again I &s;ay, run and let this &s;quirrel be found again, or you &s;hall an&s;wer to me for it.</P>

<P>MAMA, will you give me leave to go and &s;ee my cou&s;in Henry this evening?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do not chu&s;e it, Amelia.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, mama, why &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no occa&s;ion, I &s;uppo&s;e, to tell you my rea&s;ons. A little mi&s;s ought always to obey her parents, without allowing her&s;elf to a&s;k them que&s;tions. However, to &s;atisfy you that I have always a rea&s;onable motive, whenever I order or forbid you any thing, I &s;hall tell you. Your cou&s;in Henry can only &s;et you an indifferent ex|ample; and I &s;hould fear, if you &s;aw him too often, that you would imitate his levity and indi&s;cretion.</P>

<SP>

<P>But, mama&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No reply, I reque&s;t. You know that my orders mu&s;t be followed punctually.</P>
<P>Amelia retired a little to hide her tears; and &s;oon after, her mother being gone out, &s;he &s;at down in a corner, and gave her grief full vent. Ju&s;t then Nanny, who was lately come into Mrs. Barlow's &s;ervice, entered the room. "How, Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Amelia, &s;aid &s;he, are you crying?

</SP>

<P>Leave me, Nanny. You cannot comfort me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, why not? There was Mi&s;s Sophy, at my la&s;t &s;ervice, always name to me whenever any thing ailed her, "My dear Nanny, &s;he would &s;ay, you &s;ee what has happened to me; tell me, what mu&s;t I do?" And I had always good advice to give her.</P>

<P>Give me leave, at lea&s;t, to go for your mama. She will, perhaps, be better able to comfort you. I do not like to &s;ee &s;o pretty a mi&s;s as you in trouble.</P>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could never have thought it. I &s;hould always &s;uppo&s;e you &s;o rea&s;onable, that your mama could not refute you any reque&s;t. Ah! if I had a child &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed as you &s;he &s;hould be her own mi&s;tre&s;s. But your mama loves to command, and for a whim would oppo&s;e your mo&s;t innocent wi&s;hes.

<P>I dare not mention mine to you.</P>

<P>How was that?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would tell her that you were in the garden: or, if it was a little late, I would tell her that you were gone to bed, and fa&s;t a&s;leep; and immediately I would run to find you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if I thought that my mama would know nothing of it&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tru&s;t me for that: &s;he will never &s;u&s;pect it. Will you take my advice? Go and pa&s;s the evening with your little cou&s;in. Never trouble your&s;elf about the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>

<P>I have a mind to try it for once. But you pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi&s;e me at lea&s;t that mama&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go! never fear!</P>
<P>Amelia in effect did go to &s;ee her cou&s;in. Her mama came home a &s;hort time after, and a&s;ked where &s;he was. Nanny an&s;wered, that &s;he had been tired of &s;itting all alone, &s;o had eaten a good &s;upper, and was gone to bed.</P>
<P>In this manner Amelia deceived her un&s;u&s;pecting mama &s;everal times. Ah! much more did &s;he deceive her&s;elf in acting thus. Before, &s;he was always cheerful, and took plea&s;ure in being near her mama, and would run with joy to meet her, whenever &s;he had been ab&s;ent a moment. But now, what was become of her chearful|ne&s;s? She was ever &s;aying to her&s;elf, "O dear! if mama knew where I have been!" and &s;he trembled whenever &s;he heard her voice. If at any time &s;he &s;aw her look a little &s;erious, "I am undone! &s;he would cry. Mama has di&s;covered that I have di&s;obeyed her." But this was not all that made her unhappy. Nanny would often cunningly tell her how generous Mi&s;s Sophy had been to her; how often &s;he had given her &s;ugar and tea; and how freely &s;he had tru&s;ted her with the keys of the cellar and beaufet. Amelia took pride in de&s;erving from Nanny the &s;ame prai&s;es for con&s;idence and genero&s;ity. She &s;tole &s;ugar and tea from her mama for Nanny, and found means to procure her the keys of the cellar and
<PB N="138" REF="149">beau&s;et. Neverthele&s;s, &s;ometimes &s;he felt the reproaches of her con&s;cience. "I am doing wrong, &s;he would &s;ay to her&s;elf, and my tricks will be found out &s;ooner or later. I &s;hall lo&s;e the friend&s;hip of mama." She then went to Nanny, and prote&s;ted that &s;he would never give her any thing again. "Ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, mi&s;s, an&s;wered Nanny; but take care; you may perhaps, have rea&s;on to repent it! Stay till your mama comes home, I will tell her how obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iently you have followed her orders." Amelia cried and did every thing that Nanny de&s;ired her. Be|fore, it was Nanny that obeyed Amelia; but now it was Amelia that obeyed Nanny. She &s;uffered every &s;ort of rudene&s;s from her, and had nobody to whom &s;he could complain. The wicked girl came to her one day and &s;aid, "You mu&s;t know, I have a fancy to ta&s;te the pie that was looked up in the beau&s;et ye&s;terday; be&s;ides that, I want a bottle of wine. You mu&s;t go and look for the keys of your mama's drawers."</P>

<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Nanny!</P>

<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not talking about dear Nanny! Do you mind what I a&s;k of you?</P>

<SP>

<P>Why, mama will &s;ee us; or if &s;he does not &s;ee us, God Almighty will &s;ee us and puni&s;h us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;aw you all the times that you went to your cou&s;in, yet I never ob&s;erved that he has puni&s;hed you.</P>
<P>Amelia had received good in&s;tructions in religion from her mother. She was &s;trongly per&s;uaded that God has always an eye upon us; that he rewards our good actions, and has only forbidden us what is evil, becau&s;e it is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt|ful to us. It was through mere thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s that &s;he went to &s;ee her cou&s;in, contrary to her mama's orders. But it always happens that, from yielding to one error, one fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls immediately into another. She &s;aw her&s;elf obliged to do every wrong thing that her &s;ervant ordered her, for fear of being betrayed by her.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be imagined how much &s;he &s;uffered in this &s;ituation. She one day withdrew to her chamber, in order to weep at her ea&s;e. "Oh! cried &s;he, how much is one to be pitied who is di&s;obedient! Unhappy child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that I am! Slave to my own &s;ervant! I can no longer do what is my duty, but am forced to do what a wicked maid orders me. I mu&s;t be a liar, a thief and a hypocrite! Lord have mercy on me!" Saying thus, &s;he held up
<PB N="139" REF="150">both hands to hide her face which was drowned in tears, and began to reflect what &s;teps &s;he &s;hould take. At length, &s;he ro&s;e all at once, crying, "I am re&s;olved: and though my mama were not to let me come near her for a month; though &s;he were to&mdash;But no, &s;he will be reconciled to me; &s;he will call me once more her Amelia. I depend on her fondne&s;s. But how dear it will co&s;t me! How &s;hall I bear her looks and reproaches! No matter; I will confe&s;s the whole to her." She then immediately &s;prung out of her chamber, and &s;eeing her mama walking all alone in the garden, &s;he flew towards her, and embracing her clo&s;ely, covered her cheeks and her bo&s;om with her tears. Grief and confu&s;ion &s;topped her &s;peech.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! unhappy child! you will be &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barlow, at the&s;e words, left Amelia quite di&s;con|&s;olate, &s;eated on a gra&s;&s;y turf, and went to &s;eek Mr. Bar|low, and they concerted together the means of &s;aving their child from her ruin.</P>
<P>Nanny was called up. Mr. Barlow, after loading her with the &s;evere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> repreaches, ordered her to quit his hou&s;e immediately. It was in vain that &s;he wept and pleaded for a le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gorous &s;entence. In vain &s;he promi&s;ed that nothing of the &s;ame &s;ort &s;hould ever happen again. Mr. Barlow was inexorable. You know, an&s;wered he, how mildly I have treated you, and what indulgence I have &s;hewn to your faults. I thought that my kindne&s;s might induce you to &s;econd my wi&s;hes as to my child's education, and it is you that have led her into di&s;obedience and theft. You are a mon&s;ter in my &s;ight! Leave my pre&s;ence, and be careful to reform, unle&s;s you wi&s;h to fall into the hands of a more terrible judge.</P>
<P>It was next Amelia's turn. She appeared before her parents in a &s;ituation worthy of pity. Her eyes were &s;woln with crying; all the features of her face were changed; a frightful palene&s;s covered her cheeks, and her whole body &s;huddered as if in the convul&s;ions of an ague. Unable to utter a word, &s;he awaited in mournful &s;ilence the judgment of her father. "You have, &s;aid he in a &s;evere voice, you have deceived, you have offended your parents. What could incline you to follow the ad|vice of a wicked &s;ervant, rather than of your own mother, who loves you &s;o tenderly, and de&s;ires nothing in the world &s;o much as to make you happy? If I puni&s;hed you with the indignation that your behaviour in&s;pires; if I bani&s;hed you from my &s;ight for ever, as I have the com|panion of your faults, who could accu&s;e me of inju&s;tice?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! papa, you can never be unju&s;t towards me. Puni&s;h me with all the &s;everity that you &s;hall judge nece&s;|&s;ary, I will bear the whole: but begin with taking me once more in your arms; call me once more your Amelia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot embrace you &s;o &s;oon. I am wil|ling not to cha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e you, on account of the confe&s;&s;ion that you have made; but I &s;hall not call you my Amelia, until you have de&s;erved it by a long repentance. Pay great
<PB N="141" REF="152">attention to your conduct. Puni&s;hments always follow faults, and it is you that will puni&s;h your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Amelia did not as yet fully under&s;tand what her father meant by the&s;e la&s;t words. She did not expect &s;o mild a treatment: &s;he went therefore up to her parents with a heavy heart, and curt&s;ying to them, repeated afre&s;h her promi&s;es of the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In effect, &s;he kept her worn: but alas! her puni&s;hment followed very &s;oon, as her father had told her. The wicked Nanny &s;pread the mo&s;t infamous &s;tories concerning her. She told all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Amelia, and added a thou&s;and horrid lies be&s;ides. She &s;aid that Amelia, by the humble&s;t entreaties, and by the force of pre&s;ents which &s;he had &s;tolen from her parents, had laboured &s;o long to corrupt her, that at length the &s;uffered her&s;elf to be per&s;uaded to procure her &s;ecret meetings with her cou&s;in Henry; that they &s;aw each other every evening, unknown to their parents; and that Amelia came often home very late. The&s;e things &s;he related with circum&s;tances &s;o odious, that every one con|ceived the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous ideas of Amelia. She was obliged to &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel mortifications on this &s;ubject. Whenever &s;he entered among&s;t a party of her little friends, &s;he &s;aw them all whi&s;per each other, and look at her with an air of contempt, and an in&s;ulting &s;mile. If ever &s;he &s;taid &s;omewhat late in a company, they would &s;ay, "It is plain, &s;he waits here until the hour of her appointment." Had &s;he a fa&s;hionable rib|band, or an elegant dre&s;s, they would &s;ay, "Whenever one can get one's mama's keys, one may buy what one plea&s;es." In &s;hort, upon the lea&s;t difference between her and any of her companions, "Do not talk, mi&s;s! they would &s;ay. Thinking of your cou&s;in Henry confu&s;es your ideas." The&s;e reproaches were &s;o many &s;tabs to the heart of Amelia. Often, when &s;he was quite overwhelmed with grief, &s;he would throw her&s;elf into her mother's arms, and &s;eek for comfort there. Her mother generally an&s;wered her, "Suffer with patience, my dear child, what your imprudence has brought on you. Pray to God to forget your fault, and to &s;horten the time of your mor|tifications. The&s;e proofs will be of &s;ervice to you all your life, if you can profit by them. God has &s;aid to chil|dren, <HI>Honour your father and your mother, and &s;ubmit in all things to their will.</HI> This commandment is meant for
<PB N="142" REF="153">their happine&s;s. Poor children! ye know not the world yet. Ye cannot fore&s;ee the con&s;equences that your actions may draw after them. God has committed the care of guiding you to your parents who love you as them&s;elves, and who have more experience and reflection to ward off every danger from you. This you did not chu&s;e to be|lieve; but you now experience how wi&s;ely God requires of children &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their parents, &s;ince you have &s;uffered &s;o much by your di&s;obedience. My dear Amelia, let your misfortune &s;erve for your in&s;truction! It is the &s;ame with all the commandments. God pre&s;cribes to us only what is advantageous: He forbids only what is per|nicious to us. We act therefore to our own hurt, when|ever we do what is wrong. You will often find your&s;elf in circum&s;tances, when it will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to fore|&s;ee how much vice may injure you, or how much virtue may profit you. Recollect then what you have &s;uffered by one &s;ingle fault, and regulate all the actions of your life upon this unerring principle: <HI>Every action which is contrary to Virtue, is contrary to our own happine&s;s."</HI></P>
<P>Amelia punctually obeyed the wi&s;e advice of her mo|ther. The more &s;he was afterwards obliged to &s;uffer the con&s;equences of her imprudence, the more re&s;erved &s;he became and attentive to her own behaviour. She pro|fited &s;o well by this di&s;grace that, through the prudence of her conduct, &s;he &s;topped the mouths of all who would &s;peak ill of her, and obtained the name of the <HI>irreproach|able Amelia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PLEASURES AND ADVANTAGES OF A SOCIABLE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>FERDINAND was by nature of a thoughtful and ob&s;erving turn. In his walks with his uncle, nothing that &s;truck his view was lo&s;t to his reflexions. His cou&s;ins complained that, while he appeared to enjoy &s;o much
<PB N="146" REF="157">him&s;elf, he &s;ought &s;o little to contribute to the general amu&s;ement of the family. They thought at fir&s;t of re|que&s;ting their father not to take him with them any more, but a more gentle method of correcting him &s;oon occurred. They agreed together to hold the &s;ame conduct with him, for &s;ome days, that he maintained towards them. One went to &s;ee We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey; another the regalia and armoury at the Tower; a third the exhibition at Somer&s;et|hou&s;e; but when they came home, the accounts which they generally gave to each other of what they remarked were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. In&s;tead of that mutual communication of the plea&s;ures of the day which made their evenings pa&s;s &s;o delightfully before, a grave re&s;erve and a tire&s;ome &s;ilence took place among&s;t them. Ferdinand remarked this change with as much &s;urprize as mortification. He felt the want of tho&s;e effu&s;ions of communicative chear|fulne&s;s which, indeed, rarely originated from him, but in which he never failed to intere&s;t him&s;elf. Accu&s;tomed as he was to reflexion, he ea&s;ily perceived the inju&s;tice of his own behaviour, and &s;oon became as free as he had before been re&s;erved. When he yielded to this amiable principle which is implanted in men by nature, in or|der to connect and unite them by &s;entiment, his heart ta&s;ted the plea&s;ures of benevolence and friend&s;hip; and his ardent de&s;ire of knowledge found new means of grati|fication from the lights which he collected from others, at the &s;ame time that he imparted his information to them.</P>

He de&s;erves that affectionate name now.&mdash; "Our dear Frederick goes on very indifferently. He &s;old his watch &s;ome days ago, and what is &s;till wor&s;e, the greate&s;t part of his &s;chool books and books of devotion. I will tell you how I came to know it. At a &s;tanding of &s;econd-hand books, I a&s;ked the other day by chance for the Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Duty of Man; for as I had worn mine out by dint of reading it, I thought I could not do better than to buy another. The book&s;eller &s;hewed me one which I knew immediately to be Frederick's. I was po&s;itive of it, as his name was upon the title page. I bought it for &s;ix|pence, but did not &s;ay a word about it, for fear of pre|judicing our &s;chool-fellows again&s;t him. I contented my&s;elf with &s;hewing it to the head ma&s;ter who &s;ent for the book&s;eller, and a&s;ked him from whom he had that book. The book&s;eller confe&s;&s;ed that he had bought it from my cou&s;in, and Frederick could not deny it, but &s;aid, that he had &s;old it becau&s;e he wanted money; and that meantime, until he &s;hould be able to buy another, he had borrowed one from a friend who had two. The head ma&s;ter would know what he had done with this money, and Frederick told him, though I &s;u&s;pect his account to be all a fib. Oh! thought I to my&s;elf, we mu&s;t find if he has not parted with &s;ome of his nece&s;&s;aries too. I thought fir&s;t of the watch that you gave him for his new-year's gift, to let him &s;ee how his time went, which was a matter that he minded very little, as you may remember. I a&s;ked him what o'clock it was. He &s;eemed confu&s;ed and told me that his watch was at the watch-maker's. I went thither that moment, in order to be certain. There was not a word of truth in it. I ex|po&s;tulated with him, as an affectionate cou&s;in ought; but he an&s;wered me that it was no concern of mine, and that his watch was much better as he had di&s;po&s;ed of it than in his &s;ob, as he had no longer occa&s;ion to know the hour, for his bu&s;ine&s;s. Who knows what he may have done wor&s;e? for one cannot gue&s;s the whole."&mdash;Well what do you &s;ay to this, Dorothy?</P>

<STAGE>(<HI>reads.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>"Only hear what he has done &s;ince. The day before ye&s;terday he went out in the afternoon without leave. Evening came on; he did not return. Supper bell rang: he was not to be found. In &s;hort, he &s;taid out the whole night, and did not come in until the next morning. You may imagine how he was received. They a&s;ked him where he had been; but he had invented all his &s;tories before-hand. And indeed though every thing that he &s;aid were true&mdash;however, he is to appear this evening before all the ma&s;ters; and if they do him ju&s;tice he will be ex|pelled &s;hamefully, or at lea&s;t &s;ent home. What afflicts me mo&s;t is his ingratitude for all your kindne&s;&s;es, the di&s;grace that he brings on us, and the irregular way of life that he follows. I cannot believe that he told truth, in &s;peaking of the place where he &s;pent the night." And, why do not you mention it? "But I wi&s;h that he may. It would be &s;till wor&s;e, and he would only be the more worthy of your re&s;entment. He threatens now, to run away, and go home." Yes, yes, let him come! let him only put his foot upon my thre&s;hold; he will &s;ee the con|&s;equence. Let him go where he &s;pends his nights. As for you, Dorothea, I de&s;ire you never to &s;peak a word to me in his favour. They may put him in pri&s;on, &s;end him home, expel him ignominiou&s;ly; it is all equal to me. I &s;hall never concern my&s;elf about him. He may go to &s;ome &s;ea-port and &s;hip him&s;elf as cabin-boy for the We&s;t|Indies. I have u&s;ed him as my &s;on too long.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done it with plea&s;ure, and take no merit to my&s;elf for it. Your mother, while I was abroad on my travels, did the &s;ame for my children. So it became my duty, and I never to this day declined it: but&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorothea.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! if my brother has forgot him&s;elf for a moment, it is owing only to his impetuous temper. You have had him long under your eye. Whenever he had

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Vaughan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how many indi&s;cretions have I pardoned him? When he burned his eye-brows and hair with his fire-works; when he threw a &s;tone through one of our neighbour's windows, and broke a large looking|gla&s;s; when he fell into the mire, and &s;poiled a new &s;uit of clothes; when he overturned the hand&s;ome&s;t carriage that I ever had; did not I forgive him all this? I attri|buted the&s;e mi&s;chievous freaks to a petulance that did not however as yet &s;hew a bad di&s;po&s;ition: but to &s;ell his watch and his books, to leave his &s;chool a-nights and lye out, to fly again&s;t his ma&s;ters, and &s;till to have the face to think of coming home to me!</P>

<P>Ah! Mi&s;e, it is not here as in London. In the poor little villages about here, people want their corn more for them&s;elves than for their hor&s;es. I worked at daily labour in the fields, my wife &s;pun, and my children went about a&s;king charity. But we all together made &s;o little, that we were not able at the week's end to pay the rent of a poor garret.

At la&s;t, as there were a number of people about us, he told me to lead him to a place where we might be by our&s;elves, and I took him to a barn, where I had already be&s;poke my bed for the night.</P>

I &s;hould beg for you, cried he, as I am the cau&s;e of your misfortunes; but I will not &s;leep without relieving them. Here, Peter, &s;aid he, feeling in his pockets, take what money I have about me. I was not for taking it; that made him angry. I told him that it was money given him for his amu&s;ement, and that as for me, I was u&s;ed to hard&s;hip.

That is not right, &s;aid he. They would never learn any thing by that trade but idlene&s;s and profligacy. You &s;hould make your boy learn a trade, and put the girl out to a decent &s;ervice.</P>

<P>How, Percival? That is a very bad rea|&s;on for being tired of a good &s;ervant. You call him an old fellow! Child, you ought to blu&s;h for it! It is in my &s;ervice that he is grown old; and perhaps the cares which he took of your infancy and the &s;orrow that he felt for your fits of illne&s;s have ha&s;tened old age on him. You &s;ee then, how ungrateful and unrea&s;onable it would be to take an aver&s;ion to him on account of his age. And do you think your&s;elf any better founded in &s;aying that a young &s;ervant would an&s;wer our purpo&s;e?

At the &s;ame time, you know, he takes care of every thing in the hou&s;e; he has of him&s;elf undertaken the trouble of in&s;pecting the other &s;ervants, and has often &s;aved me great expences. He does all this through good-will, without any particular order; becau&s;e I gained his grati|tude by occa&s;ional pre&s;ents. When your years will allow you to mix in the world, you will hear nothing in every family but complaints of the negligence and ingratitude of &s;ervants.

<P>I take plea&s;ure in making you this return for acknowledging your fault, and for your genero&s;ity to hone&s;t Colin. "Captain Flood, a brave officer, who had retired from the &s;ervice, lived upon his e&s;tate, with his wife, an amiable lady, and five children worthy of &s;uch excellent parents. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t re&s;pect for them, and this family all together formed the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ight imaginable. The &s;weetne&s;s of Mr. Flood's di&s;po&s;ition, and the excellent order that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in his hou&s;e, gained him the good-will and admiration of all tho&s;e who had the happine&s;s of knowing him. The young people in tho&s;e parts were eager to be in his &s;ervice; and whenever a place was vacant in his family by a &s;ervant's dying or going away, it was &s;ought as a de&s;irable &s;ituation. Content appeared in the faces of all his people. To &s;ee them, one would have taken them for dutiful children round their father. His orders were &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o moderate, that not one of them ever had a thought of di&s;obeying him. Harmony reigned among&s;t them as among&s;t brothers. If ever they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|puted, it was which had mo&s;t zeal in the &s;ervice of their ma&s;ter, and mo&s;t attachment to his intere&s;ts. Mr. Ful|mer, who was formerly an intimate of Captain Flood's,
<PB N="172" REF="183">and had like him retired to his e&s;tate in another county, &s;topped one day at his hou&s;e, in pa&s;&s;ing that way on his road to London. After a variety of di&s;cour&s;e, the con|ver&s;ation fell at la&s;t upon the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances frequently attending the care of a family. Mr. Fulmer complained of the fatiguing employment of watching over &s;ervants; that he had never found any but &s;uch as were in&s;olent, idle, or inattentive to their ma&s;ter's bu&s;i|ne&s;s. As to that, &s;aid Mr. Flood, I cannot complain of mine. For the&s;e ten years I have had to weighty &s;ubject of di&s;plea&s;ure. I am very well &s;atisfied with them, and they are the &s;ame with me. That is a happine&s;s not very common, &s;aid Mr. Fulmer. You mu&s;t have &s;ome parti|cular &s;ecret for making good &s;ervants, and for keeping them in that perfection. The &s;ecret is very &s;imple, an|&s;wered Mr. Flood; and here it is, continued he, pointing to a &s;mall de&s;k. I do not under&s;tand you, &s;aid Mr. Ful|mer; but Mr. Flood, without making any reply, opened the de&s;k. It contained &s;ix drawers, with the&s;e titles:&mdash; <HI>Extraordinary expences.&mdash;For my&s;elf.&mdash;For my wife.&mdash;For my children.&mdash;Servants wages.&mdash;Gratuities to them.</HI>&mdash;As I have always by me, re&s;umed Mr. Flood, a year's rent of my e&s;tate beforehand, I make &s;ix portions of it at the beginning of every year. In the fir&s;t drawer I put a certain &s;um, which is inviolably re&s;erved for unfore&s;een occa&s;ions. In the &s;econd what I intend for my own expences. The third contains the money nece&s;&s;ary for the dome&s;tic charges of the family, and my wife's pin-money. The fourth &s;ufficient for the proper education of my children. The wages of my &s;ervants are in the fifth; and in the &s;ixth are the gratuities that I be&s;tow them. It is to this la&s;t drawer that I owe the happine&s;s of having never had bad &s;ervants. Their wages are for what their duty requires of them: but the pre&s;ents that I di&s;tribute to them occa&s;ionally, are for the performance of what is not &s;trictly comprized within their duty, for &s;ervices in which their affection to me out|&s;trips my orders and my wi&s;hes."</P>

O brother! what have you done? &s;aid Dorinda, taking up the flower which was broken off from the &s;talk. She was holding it &s;till in her hand, when her father, who had fini&s;hed dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, entered the parlour. How, Dorinda, &s;aid Mr. Vernon in an angry tone, do you pluck a flower that you have &s;een me take &s;o much pains to rear in order to have &s;eed from it? Dear papa, an&s;wered Dorinda, trembling, pray do not be angry! I am not angry, replied Mr. Vernon, growing more calm; but as you may take a fancy to pluck flowers too in the garden that I am going to &s;ee, and which does not belong to me, you will not take it ami&s;s that I leave you at home.</P>
<P>Dorinda looked down, and held her tongue. Alfred could not keep &s;ilence any longer. He approached his father with tears in his eyes, and &s;aid, It was not my &s;i&s;ter, papa; it was I that plucked off the flower: &s;o it is I that mu&s;t &s;tay at home. Take my &s;i&s;ter along with you.</P>
<P>Mr. Vernon, touched with the ingenuous behaviour of his children, and their affection for each other, ki&s;&s;ed them, and &s;aid, You are both dear to me alike, and you &s;hall both come with me.</P>
<P>Alfred and Dorinda leaped for joy. They went there|fore to walk in the garden, where they &s;aw plants of the mo&s;t curious &s;orts. Mr. Vernon with plea&s;ure ob&s;erved Dorinda pre&s;s her cloaths on each &s;ide, and Alfred take up the &s;kirts of his coat under his arms, for fear of doing any damage as they walked among the flowers. The flower that he had lo&s;t would, without doubt, have given

If any one, by mi&s;take, touched her play-things, &s;he would give that per&s;on a &s;ide|look, and grumble between her teeth for a quarter of an hour.

It is true, &s;he &s;ometimes repented of her faults; nay, &s;he often &s;hed tears in private, on &s;eeing her&s;elf become the aver&s;ion of every body, even to her parents. But habit &s;oon got the better of her, and her temper became more cro&s;s every day. One evening (it was New-Year's Eve) &s;he &s;aw her mother go towards her room with a &s;mall ba&s;ket under her cloak. Ro&s;alind would have followed her, but Mrs. Fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ner ordered her to go back to the parlour.

What was her &s;urprize, on &s;eeing the room lighted up with twenty candles, and the table covered with the mo&s;t elegant toys. She could not utter a word, tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;|perted as &s;he was with joy and admiration. Come hither, Ro&s;alind, &s;aid her mother, and read on this paper for
<PB N="175" REF="186">whom the&s;e things are intended. Ro&s;alind went to the table, and &s;aw among&s;t the toys a &s;lip of paper, on which &s;he read the following words written in large l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tters:&mdash; <HI>For an amiable little girl, in return for her good behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>She looked down, and did not &s;ay a word. Well, Ro&s;alind, &s;aid her mother, for whom is this intended?</P>
<P>Not for me, &s;aid Ro&s;alind, with the tears in her eyes.</P>
<P>Here is another paper, &s;aid Mrs. Faulkener; &s;ee if this does not concern you.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alind took it, and read, <HI>For a froward little girl, who is &s;en&s;ible of her faults, and in beginning a new year will take pains to amend them.</HI> Oh! that is I, that is I! &s;aid &s;he, throwing her&s;elf into her mother's arms, and crying bitterly. Mrs. Faulkener al&s;o dropped tears, partly of &s;orrow for her daughter's faults, and partly of joy for the repentance that &s;he &s;hewed. Come, &s;aid &s;he, after a moment's &s;ilence, take what is intended for you, and may God, who has heard your re&s;olution, give you force to execute it!</P>
<P>No, mama, an&s;wered Ro&s;alind, the whole belongs to the per&s;on meant in the fir&s;t paper. Keep it for me, until I am like her: you can tell me when I am &s;o. This an&s;wer gave Mrs. Faulkener much plea&s;ure; &s;he therefore imme|diately put all the toys into a drawer, and giving the key to Ro&s;alind, &s;aid, There, my dear child, you &s;hall open the drawer when you your&s;elf &s;hall think it the proper time.</P>
<P>Near &s;ix weeks pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t in&s;tance of ill|humour from Ro&s;alind. She threw her arms round her mother's neck, and &s;obbing, a&s;ked, May I open the drawer, mama? Yes, my dear, you may, an&s;wered Mrs. Faulkener, cla&s;ping her tenderly in her arms. But pray tell me how you have managed to get the better of your temper &s;o? I &s;tudied it continually, replied Ro&s;a|lind; it co&s;t me &s;ome trouble, but every morning and evening, and a hundred times in the day, I prayed to God to keep up my courage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Faulkener &s;hed the mo&s;t delicious tears; and Ro|&s;alind became mi&s;tre&s;s of the toys, and &s;oon after, of the affections of all her friends.</P>
<P>Her mother related this happy change in pre&s;ence of a little mi&s;s who had the &s;ame fault; and &s;he was &s;o &s;truck with it that &s;he immediately formed the re&s;olution of imitating Ro&s;alind, in order to become amiable like her.
<PB N="176" REF="187">This attempt had the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s: and thus Ro&s;alind was not only more happy her&s;elf, but rendered tho&s;e al&s;o happy who cho&s;e to profit by her example. What child of &s;pirit would not wi&s;h to enjoy the &s;ame honour and the &s;ame happine&s;s?</P>

<HEAD>THE USEFUL DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ONE fine morning, in the month of June, Ambro&s;e prepared to &s;et out with his father on a party of plea&s;ure, which for a fortnight before had taken up all his thoughts. He had ri&s;en, contrary to his cu&s;tom, very early, in order to ha&s;ten the preparations for his jaunt. However, ju&s;t as he thought that he had reached the object of his wi&s;hes, the &s;ky darkened all at once, the clouds grew thick, and a violent wind bent down the trees and rai&s;ed up a tempe&s;t of du&s;t. Ambro&s;e went down every moment into the garden, to ob&s;erve how the &s;ky looked: he then &s;kipped up the &s;tairs three at a time, to examine the baro|meter; but the &s;ky and the barometer were both again&s;t him. For all this, he did not &s;cruple to give his father good hopes, and to a&s;&s;ure him that the&s;e unfavourable appearances would di&s;per&s;e in a moment; that pre&s;ently it would be the fine&s;t weather in the world; and he con|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uded, that they ought to &s;et out directly, to have the benefit of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Powell, who did not repo&s;e a blind confidence in his &s;on's progno&s;tics, thought it more prudent to wait a little. Ju&s;t then the clouds bur&s;t, and di&s;charged a heavy &s;hower of rain. Ambro&s;e, who was doubly di&s;appointed, began to cry, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to be comforted. The rain continued until three o'clock in the afternoon. At length the clouds di&s;per&s;ed, the &s;un re&s;umed his lu&s;tre, the &s;ky its clearne&s;s, and all nature breathed the fre&s;hne&s;s of the Spring. Ambro&s;e recovered his good humour by degrees, in proportion as the &s;ky brightened. His father took him out a little way, and the calmne&s;s of the air, the &s;inging of the birds, the fre&s;h green of the fields, and the &s;weet perfume that breathed all round him, re&s;tored peace and &s;atisfaction completely to his heart. Do not
<PB N="177" REF="188">you remark, &s;aid his father to him, the agreeable change ju&s;t now produced all round you? Recollect how dull every thing ye&s;terday appeared to us; the ground parched up by a long drought, the flowers without colour and hanging their languid heads, and in &s;hort, all vegetation &s;eeming to be at a &s;tand. What mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e to have &s;o &s;uddenly made nature appear young again? The rain that has fallen to-day, &s;aid Ambro&s;e.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice of his complaints, and the folly of his be|haviour, &s;truck him &s;en&s;ibly as he pronounced the&s;e words. He blu&s;hed, and his father judged that his own thoughts would be &s;ufficient to teach him another time to &s;acrifice, without reluctance, a &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ure to the general advan|tage of mankind.</P>

<STAGE>(<HI>reeds</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>"My dear &s;on. The difficulty that you find in writ|ing, has not, I &s;ee, hindered your complying with my re|que&s;t;
<PB N="183" REF="194">and your letter is even longer than I could expect. This willingne&s;s in you convinces me that you love me. I am &s;en&s;ible of it, and thank you &s;incerely for it. You tell me that you have been introduced to the prince; that he has been &s;o good as to approve of you; that he is the be&s;t and milde&s;t of ma&s;ters, and that you love him very much already."
<STAGE>(<HI>He looks at the page.</HI>)</STAGE> What, my friend, you have written &s;o to your mother? I only do my duty, then, in making you a return, and in &s;eeking to give you proofs of my friend&s;hip. "You have rea&s;on to love him, my dear child; for without his generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, what would be your lot in this world? You have lo&s;t your father; and although your mother be &s;till living, you are not the le&s;s to be pitied. Fortune has put it out of her power to fulfil her duty to you; that is my greate&s;t grief, and the mo&s;t cruel of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es. While I had only to think of my&s;elf, misfortunes could never affect me; but when your image offers it&s;elf to my thoughts, my heart is ready to bur&s;t, and my tears never cea&s;e." Much tenderne&s;s, much &s;en&s;ibility appears here; and if &s;he be as excellent a woman as &s;he is a tender mother&mdash;And why &s;hould &s;he not? She is, I have not a doubt of it. "I cannot, my dear, lead you my&s;elf in the road to fortune, as I could wi&s;h; I am obliged to remain here in &s;olitude and retirement; but I &s;hall never cea&s;e to give you my advice with all the earne&s;tne&s;s of affection; and while my voice can reach you, it &s;hall con&s;tantly entreat you to follow the paths of honour and virtue. As a fre&s;h proof of that obedience which you have hitherto &s;hewn to me, I reque&s;t you always to carry this letter about you."
<STAGE>(<HI>Looks at the page.</HI>)</STAGE> Well, he has been obedient. "If ever you &s;hould be in danger of failing in your duty, or neglecting the advice that I gave you when I ki&s;&s;ed you at parting, and bedewed you with my tears, then my dear &s;on remember this letter; open it; think of your mother, your unfortunate mother, who is only &s;upported in her &s;olitude by the hopes that &s;he builds on you." What has he not a brother? "Think that &s;he would die with grief were you to behave ami&s;s, and that you your&s;elf would &s;tab the heart that loves you above all things upon earth." She &s;ees his danger. She is right, for he is much expo&s;ed here. Ought the to have &s;ent him hither? "It is not &s;u&s;picion or di&s;tru&s;t that make
<PB N="184" REF="195">me &s;peak thus. Your behaviour never gave me cau&s;e for them. No, my dear child; but your brother has made my tears flow; you, I hope, will &s;pare the feelings of your mother more than he has done." So then, the elde&s;t?&mdash;the en&s;ign?&mdash;I mu&s;t inform my&s;elf more of this. "You have always behaved with duty and re&s;pect; I own it with tears of joy. Go on, my dear child; be|come an hone&s;t man, and your mother, be &s;he ever &s;o poor, ever &s;o unhappy, will &s;oon forget her misfortunes and di&s;tre&s;s." Very well. I like this woman; misfor|tune exalts her &s;entiments, in&s;tead of depre&s;&s;ing them. "You tell me at the end of your letter, that all your companions have watches. I know that you &s;hould have one too; however, you break off there, and do not ex|pre&s;s even a wi&s;h for one. This re&s;erve plea&s;es me, and I am unhappy in not being able to reward it. You know, my dear, that I cannot, and therefore you will pardon me. Bu&s;ine&s;s of importance calls me to the capital; I am going thither, and this journey will take from me what little money I have left. It is a nece&s;&s;ary expence, and I cannot avoid it. But be a&s;&s;ured that in the end I &s;hall do every thing in my power to &s;atisfy your wi&s;h. And &s;hould I even &s;tint my&s;elf of nece&s;&s;aries, I will never &s;uffer my heart's be&s;t beloved to want an encouragement to virtue. I hope &s;oon to &s;ee you again, and am."&mdash; This woman is worthy of a better lot. I will keep this letter, and &s;hew it to my wife. But no, it is this child's trea&s;ure; why deprive him of it?
<STAGE>(<HI>He puts the letter into the page's pocket again.</HI>)</STAGE> With what tranquility he &s;leeps &s;till! Heaven, they &s;ay, prepares the happine&s;s of its children while they &s;leep.
