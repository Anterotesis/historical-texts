<P>THOSE who con&s;ult the map of this portion of the globe, will in&s;tantly perceive the effect of the rapid di&s;|charge of the waters after the de&s;truction of the old world by the deluge, aided by volcanic fury. Volcanoes, or ve&s;|tiges of volcanoes, are to be &s;een in mo&s;t parts to this day; amazing caverns, mountains piled upon mountains, with all the te&s;timonies of the mighty confu&s;ion; we know not the ante|cedent form, but it was evidently &s;hattered by that great event. From the top of the bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> to the very pole, it &s;wept every thing before it, and left a va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean, uninter|rupted by any land, except the diminutive &s;pots of <HI>Kerguelin</HI> i&s;lands, or the le&s;&s;er &s;peck of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>St. Paulo.</HI></P>
<P>FROM Cape <HI>Negrais,</HI> the &s;outhern point of <HI>Pegu,</HI> the waters &s;eem to have been impelled towards the va&s;t <HI>Pacific Ocean.</HI> The i&s;les of <HI>Andaman</HI> and <HI>Nicobar</HI> fir&s;t &s;hew that tendency in a &s;light degree; all the penin&s;ula of <HI>Malacca</HI> was affected in a higher. The i&s;land of <HI>Sumatra</HI> follows the curvature of that part of the continent. At <HI>Java</HI> it begins to &s;hew the &s;ury of the
<PB N="2" REF="10">attracted cour&s;e of the waters towards the ea&s;t. <HI>Java, Cumbava, Timor,</HI> the <HI>Molucca</HI> i&s;lands, and <HI>New Guinea</HI> were formed by their influence. At <HI>New Guinea</HI> the torrent took a &s;outherly direction, and rent into fragments all that part of the primitive world, even to the remote&s;t of the <HI>Society</HI> i&s;lands, which, like the train of a comet, &s;hew the innumerable remnants of land, mo&s;t evident witne&s;&s;es of its cour&s;e. The amazing i&s;land of <HI>New Holland</HI> re&s;i&s;ted the force, and continues, more worthy of the name of a continent. <HI>New Zealand</HI> remains divided from all the re&s;t; to the ea&s;t is &s;ea as far as <HI>America,</HI> and remote as the pole it&s;elf on the &s;outh. The north part of the va&s;t <HI>Pacific</HI> is contracted by the ap|proximation of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> The cre&s;cent of i&s;lands from <HI>Ala&s;chka</HI> to <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> mark the antient union of the pre&s;ent continents. The flood formed from the &s;outh of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> the <HI>Kuril</HI> i&s;les, <HI>Matmay,</HI> and <HI>Japan, Liqueo</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Philippine</HI> i&s;lands, the great <HI>Borneo,</HI> and all the groups &s;cattered over the ocean to the north-ea&s;t, &s;uch as the <HI>Pelew,</HI> the <HI>La|drones,</HI> and the <HI>Carolinas,</HI> and the range named after Lord <HI>Mul|grave.</HI> Such is the hypothetical view of this face of the globe.</P>
<P><HI>Sumatra,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SUMATRA.</NOTE> the fir&s;t i&s;land which &s;trikes our eye, bounds the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treights of <HI>Malacca.</HI> The equator cro&s;&s;es it in the middle, and divides it into almo&s;t two equal parts. <HI>Acheen</HI> head lies in Lat. 5&deg; 33&prime; north, and <HI>Hogs</HI> point in 5&deg; 5&prime; &s;outh. The length is about eight hundred miles, and the greate&s;t breadth a hundred and thirty. All the we&s;tern &s;ide is very low, and in|ter&s;ected with &s;wamps, in&s;ulating certain patches &s;lightly ele|vated. A range of mountains runs through the whole i&s;land, much nearer to the we&s;tern than the ea&s;tern coa&s;t. In &s;ome
<PB N="3" REF="11">places they are double and treble, with beautiful vallies between each chain; but, excepting where cleared, both valley and mountain are clothed with &s;hady fore&s;ts. The&s;e chains approxi|mate to the coa&s;t on the whole of the we&s;tern &s;ide. At their foot is low, and often &s;wampy land.</P>
<P>SOME of the mountains are of a va&s;t height; <HI>Ophir,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MOUNT OPHIR.</NOTE> &s;ituated immediately under the line, is 13,842 feet high, or two miles one thou&s;and and ninety-four yards. No &s;now is ever &s;een on it, yet the inhabitants of all the chains are, like tho&s;e of other alpine regions, &s;ubject to mon&s;trous wens or <HI>goitres:</HI> this malady owes its origin to the water, or the thick, cold, and foggy vapors which univer&s;ally ari&s;e from the vallies. The&s;e people are not infe&s;ted with any particular di&s;ea&s;e, the re&s;ult of the tumors; they enjoy the &s;ame health as others;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BAD CLIMATE.</NOTE> but the climate of <HI>Sumatra</HI> near to the &s;ea, or amid&s;t the &s;wamps, is dreadful. "Near <HI>Indrapour,</HI>" &s;ays <HI>Lind</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Di&s;ea&s;es, p. 79.</NOTE>,
<Q>is a place where no <HI>European</HI> can venture to &s;leep one night on &s;hore during the rainy &s;ea&s;on without running the hazard of his life, or at lea&s;t of a dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s; and at <HI>Podang,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ettlement on the &s;ame i&s;land, the air has been found &s;o bad, that it is commonly called the <HI>Plague Coa&s;t.</HI> Here a thick pe&s;tilential vapor or fog ari&s;es after the rains, from the mar&s;hes, which de&s;troys all the white inha|bitants.</Q></P>
<P>IN all the&s;e chains are numbers of volcanoes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">VOLCANOES.</NOTE> which are called by the <HI>Malayes, Goonong Appee;</HI> they generally &s;moke, but &s;el|dom emit flames or <HI>lava</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mar&s;den</HI>'s <HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>. I believe no accurate ob&s;ervations have been yet made on their nature, being at a con&s;iderable
<PB N="4" REF="12">di&s;tance inland, and the approach impeded by deep and almo&s;t impenetrable fore&s;ts. Sulphur may be collected in any quantity about their &s;ides.</P>
<P>THE i&s;land abounds with minerals.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MINERALS.</NOTE> It has been long famous for its gold;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> &s;ome is dug out of the earth; but by rea&s;on of the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the climate, no <HI>Europeans</HI> dare attempt to work, and the natives are too lazy to go to any depth. The greate&s;t part is taken out of the rivers, and wa&s;hed from the &s;and and gravel. The amount brought annually to the we&s;tern parts of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> does not exceed ten thou&s;and ounces. <HI>Menanga|cabow,</HI> a central and principal kingdom, has the greate&s;t quan|tity, the riche&s;t mines lying within its territory. The <HI>Malayes</HI> are mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;ts in works of fillagree, in both gold and &s;ilver. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;den</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 141.</NOTE> gives an ample account of the manufac|ture, which, with the coar&s;e&s;t of in&s;truments, is carried on to the mo&s;t amazing degree of elegance and perfection. On mention of that gentleman, let me own my obligation to his admirable hi&s;|tory of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> for mo&s;t of the articles on the &s;ubject of that i&s;land.</P>
<P>I FIND no mention of any &s;ilver being found here;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COPPER.</NOTE> but it produces abundance of copper, of the riche&s;t kind.</P>
<P>TIN is met with in va&s;t plenty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TIN.</NOTE> chiefly near <HI>Palambang,</HI> on the ea&s;t coa&s;t, and on the i&s;le of <HI>Banka;</HI> it is a con&s;iderable ar|ticle of trade, and, &s;melted into &s;mall pieces, is exported in great quantities to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>IRON is found in <HI>Menangacabow,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">IRON.</NOTE> where it is fu&s;ed for u&s;e.</P>
<P>COAL is a production of <HI>Sumatra.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COAL.</NOTE> <HI>Naptha,</HI> or earth oil, is
<PB N="5" REF="13">another, and is principally u&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t the ravages of the <HI>termes,</HI> or white ants.</P>
<P>SALTPETRE is procured in abundance out of the va&s;t caverns with which the i&s;land is hollowed, and is extracted out of the dung of the &s;wallows called <HI>Layang Layang,</HI> which build by thou&s;ands in the roofs. The&s;e &s;eem to be the kind which make the e&s;cu|lent ne&s;ts. The dung extends often twenty feet in breadth, and is from four to &s;ix feet in depth.</P>
<P><HI>Napal,</HI> or the Steatites earth, forms the ba&s;is of the cliffs, and often the beds of the rivers.</P>
<P>I SHALL now pur&s;ue the other parts of the natural hi&s;tory, begin with the zoology, and treat of it on the authority of Mr. <HI>Mar&s;den,</HI> flinging it into a &s;y&s;tematic form.</P>
<P>THE Hor&s;es are &s;mall and hardy;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HORSES, COWS, SHEEP.</NOTE> the cows and &s;heep are al&s;o &s;mall; the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the <HI>Bengal</HI> breed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>buffalo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BUFFALO.</NOTE> or <HI>carbow,</HI> the mo&s;t u&s;eful animal of the i&s;land, is the bea&s;t of draught, and &s;upplies the inhabitants with milk and butter. There are none at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>DOMESTIC <HI>goats</HI> are common, and are called <HI>Cambing.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOATS.</NOTE> As to the <HI>Cambing Ootan,</HI> or goat of the woods, of Mr. <HI>Mar&s;den,</HI> his de&s;cription is not &s;ufficient for me to a&s;certain the <HI>&s;pecies:</HI> "One," &s;ays he
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumatra,</HI> p. 93.</NOTE>,
<Q>which I &s;aw, was three feet in height, and four feet in the length of the body. It had &s;omething of the <HI>gazelle</HI> in its appearance; and, excepting the horns, which were about &s;ix inches long, and turned back with an arch, it did not much re&s;emble the common goat. The hinder parts were &s;haped like tho&s;e of a bear, the rump &s;loping round off
<PB N="6" REF="14">from the back. The tail was very &s;mall, and ended in a point. The legs clum&s;y. The hair along the ridge of the back ri&s;ing coar&s;e and &s;trong, almo&s;t like bri&s;tles. No beard. Over the &s;houlder was a large &s;preading tuft of greyi&s;h hair; the re&s;t of the hair black throughout. The <HI>Scrotum</HI> globular.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIR JAMES LANCASTER.</NOTE> afterwards Sir <HI>James,</HI> was &s;ent there, and &s;ailed from <HI>Torbay</HI> on April 2d, 1601. He commanded the <HI>Dragon</HI> of &s;ix hundred tons, and had with him the <HI>Hector</HI> of three hundred, the <HI>A&s;cen|&s;ion</HI> of two hundred and &s;ixty, and one more. Her Highne&s;s furni&s;hed her general, as he was called, with letters to divers of the ea&s;tern potentates, among others, one to the king of <HI>Acheen,</HI> the chief and fir&s;t object of the voyage. He did not arrive at <HI>Su|matra</HI> till May 2d, 1602. The fame of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s victories over the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had reached the king's ears, and in con&s;equence <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> was mo&s;t favorably received; he pre&s;ented gifts of great value on the part of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and received others in return. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> did all in their power to prevent a good under|&s;tanding between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the king, but to no purpo&s;e. <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> even made a &s;hort crui&s;e, and took a rich &s;hip from <HI>Saint Thome</HI> on the <HI>Coromandel</HI> coa&s;t, belonging to the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> which was deemed a lawful prize, that kingdom being then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our great enemy <HI>Philip</HI> II. Our general got in part of his lading of pepper in this i&s;land; the re&s;t in <HI>Ma|lacca;</HI> and after obtaining many valuable privileges from the king of <HI>Acheen,</HI> returned with a mo&s;t friendly letter from the <HI>Sumatran</HI> prince. He met with a dreadful &s;torm off <HI>Mada|ga&s;car;</HI> in the mid&s;t of the confu&s;ion, he thought of the &s;ervices he might render to his country by this remarkable notice:
<Q>The pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> lies in 62 degrees 30 minutes, by the
<PB N="18" REF="26">north-we&s;t on the <HI>American</HI> &s;ide.</Q> After encountering many difficulties, he anchored &s;afe in the <HI>Downs</HI> on September 11th 1603. Sir <HI>James</HI> acquired great wealth and reputation by this voyage, which he lived thirty years after to enjoy, as he well de&s;erved.</P>
<P>WE followed the advantages of this enterprize. The <HI>Dutch</HI> who had &s;ettled them&s;elves in the i&s;land, entertained the highe&s;t jealou&s;y of our ri&s;ing commerce, and gave all po&s;&s;ible oppo|&s;ition; they even once expelled us from <HI>Bantam,</HI> where we had a factory. We then turned our thoughts towards <HI>Acheen,</HI> and met there &s;ome of the i&s;land chieftains in the year 1685, who invited us to &s;ettle on their lands; this, gave ri&s;e to our e&s;ta|bli&s;hment at <HI>Bencoolen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BENCOOLEN.</NOTE> which became the &s;upreme factory. The fort called fort <HI>Marlborough</HI> was founded; we are now the prin|cipal traders in the i&s;land, and export from thence annually twelve hundred tons of pepper, the greate&s;t part to <HI>Europe,</HI> the re&s;t to <HI>China.</HI> This &s;ettlement is unwhole&s;ome, the air full of malignant vapors; the mountains continually cloathed with thick heavy clouds, which break out in lightning, thunder, rain, and &s;hort-lived &s;torms; the fort is tolerably healthy during the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, and to that place the merchants &s;hould make their retreat.</P>
<P>IN the year 1760, the <HI>French</HI> admiral <HI>D'E&s;taign</HI> de&s;troyed this fort, and all our other &s;ettlements on the i&s;land, in order to drive us from the lucrative pepper trade; but they were &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;ecured to us in 1763 by the treaty of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

The fi&s;h weighs often thirty pounds, and is excellent when &s;tewed.</P>
<P><HI>Sumatra</HI> is divided into numerous little kingdoms,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ACHEEN.</NOTE> but that of <HI>Acheen</HI> is the mo&s;t powerful. It once had a &s;trong and nume|rous fleet, with which it conte&s;ted the &s;uperiority of the &s;ea with the adjacent princes. <HI>Acheen</HI> was the great <HI>emporium</HI> of the i&s;land, and the re&s;ort of the <HI>Arabs</HI> for the gold, camphor, ben|zoin, pepper, and all the commercial productions of the country. The government is entirely feudal, being founded on the <HI>Ma|layan</HI> plan. As to the genuine <HI>Sumatrans</HI> they are called <HI>Orang Ooloo,</HI> or countrymen, from their re&s;idence in villages. The <HI>Sultan</HI> of the empire of <HI>Menangecabow,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EMPIRE OF MENANGECA|BOW.</NOTE> for a long time reigned lord paramount over all the other princes, who owned their au|thority to be derived from him: at pre&s;ent his real power is not &s;uperior to that of a common Rajah; yet &s;till a &s;uper&s;titious re|gard is paid to his per&s;on; he is &s;overeign pontiff; the opinion of his &s;anctity is &s;upported by the <HI>Mahometan</HI> prie&s;ts, and an
<PB N="20" REF="28">air of my&s;tery &s;urrounds his court; he i&s;&s;ues out dictatorial edicts, which are received with re&s;pect; but attended to no far|ther than is con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;ts or plea&s;ure of them to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed. All the <HI>Sumatrans</HI> are originally de|rived from the <HI>Malayes,</HI> or inhabitants of the penin&s;ula of <HI>Ma|lacca;</HI> when &s;poken of in this i&s;land, the word <HI>Malaye</HI> implies the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who chiefly inhabit the coa&s;ts. <HI>Mahometani&s;m</HI> is the religion of all the <HI>Malaye</HI> governments; all ob&s;erve the feudal &s;y&s;tem,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FEUDAL CUSTOM.</NOTE> and commute the puni&s;hment of crimes for money, which have their price as cu&s;tomary among the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and <HI>Britons.</HI> Murder, as well as other crimes, having its price; this cu&s;tom is a dreadful encouragement, particularly &s;ince the <HI>Daltoos</HI> or magi&s;trates receive the ran&s;om. Our factory was de&s;irous of putting a &s;top to the frequent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, but was told by the <HI>Daltoo</HI> that he &s;hould be a lo&s;er, as he got twenty dollars a head when the families pro&s;ecuted. Some of the&s;e governments are very antient, being formed &s;oon after the fir&s;t population of the i&s;land. <HI>Menangecabow</HI> is one which received the <HI>Mahometan</HI> faith in later times from the <HI>Malayes</HI> of <HI>Ma|lacca,</HI> who had made a conque&s;t of their antecedent brethren.</P>
<P>IN p. 33 of the preceding volume, I have given the general de|&s;cription of the per&s;ons of the <HI>Malayes.</HI> I cannot help thinking that tho&s;e of <HI>Malacca</HI> were a di&s;tinct people, who drove the an|tient inhabitants of the penin&s;ula to take refuge in <HI>Sumatra,</HI> where they retain their language and alphabet, and that the <HI>Malayes</HI> in future times re-conquered the de&s;cendants of the&s;e refugees, and each &s;till retain their peculiar language and writing.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29">I SHALL not attempt to give an account of the various na|tions into which this i&s;land is divided:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES OF THE BATTAS.</NOTE> That of the <HI>Battas</HI> is too remarkable to be overlooked; they are of &s;maller &s;tature than the re&s;t of the <HI>Sumatrans,</HI> and their complexions fairer; their religion is pagani&s;m, yet from very antient cu&s;tom they hold in re&s;pect the &s;ultan of <HI>Menangecabow,</HI> in all probability from the period in which both were of the &s;ame religion. We have our &s;ettlement on their coa&s;t, which enabled two of our factory, Mr. <HI>Charles Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Holloway,</HI> to undertake a journey into the interior parts of the country. I refer my reader for the par|ticular account to the lxviiith volume of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions. From this expedition is verified the circum&s;tance of the natives being <HI>anthropophagi,</HI> and eat the fle&s;h of pri&s;oners of war, or of offenders condemned for capital crimes. As &s;oon as the man is put to death, they ru&s;h on the body, cut pieces of the yet tremulous limbs, dip it in lemon juice and &s;alt, and eat it with exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure. Mr. <HI>Miller</HI> &s;ays, they &s;pake in raptures of the &s;oles of the feet, and palms of the hands, as pe|culiar dainties. <HI>Marco Polo</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron, p. 134.</NOTE> tells us, that in the kingdom of <HI>Dragoiam</HI> they eat the bodies of their relations and be&s;t friends who chance to die, thinking it a peculiar re&s;pect to the decea&s;ed. They then bury the bones in the caverns of the mountains. <HI>Polo</HI> mentions this horrid cu&s;tom in other i&s;lands, &s;o that it cer|tainly had &s;pread far more exten&s;ively than is imagined. The opinion was generally exploded, till the voyages in our days fur|ni&s;hed us with &s;everal examples; &s;ome mo&s;t dreadful, in which many <HI>Europeans</HI> fell victims to the cannibal appetite: Even the

He found the men from five feet eight to five feet ten inches high, of a red color, with black &s;trait hair cut &s;hort; that of the women long, and rolled into a neat curl on the top of the head. The men went quite naked; the women had no more than a plantain leaf to hide their nakedne&s;s; the arms of the men were lances headed with the bone of fi&s;h, their canoes made of two boards &s;ewed together, and the &s;eam filled with pitch. Their hou&s;es were circular, &s;up|ported on &s;takes of iron-wood; they had no &s;ort of fowl, cattle, or rice; they lived on cocoa nuts, &s;ugar canes, and &s;weet po|tatoes, or fi&s;h dried in the &s;moke. The fi&s;h they caught with their lances, or in nets very neatly manufactured by them&s;elves. Their behavior was ho&s;pitable, nor did they give any &s;ort of um|brage, till &s;ome imprudent conduct on our &s;ide excited an alarm.

<P>THE tree,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">STRANGE ACCOUNT OF.</NOTE> &s;o long famed in many of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> i&s;lands for the wonderful, and almo&s;t incredible effects of its poi&s;onous juice, has hitherto eluded the prying eye of the naturali&s;t; and, con|&s;equently, its cla&s;s in the botanical &s;y&s;tem has never yet been a&s;certained, notwith&s;tanding the indefatigable re&s;earches of <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> to obtain full information upon &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject; all we know for certain of the tree it&s;elf is, the figure of its leaf, and fruit, which the learned and accurate <HI>Rumphius</HI> has exhi|bited in the <HI>Herbarium Amboinen&s;e.</HI> After much entreaty, and per&s;evering application to the <HI>Dutch</HI> governors of <HI>Celebes</HI> (the mo&s;t noted of all the i&s;lands of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> for the production of this tree), <HI>Rumphius</HI> was favored by <HI>De Cops,</HI> governor of <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ar,</HI> with a branch of it, and a &s;pecimen of its poi&s;onous juice. An en&s;ign of the army was deputed in form to be the me&s;&s;enger of &s;o rare a pre&s;ent. Of &s;uch a penetrating and malignant na|ture
<PB N="43" REF="51">was this found to be, that the very touching with the hand the <HI>Bamboo</HI> in which it was inclo&s;ed, occa&s;ioned a tingling and numbne&s;s like that felt in a limb that had been expo&s;ed to in|ten&s;e cold, and &s;uddenly brought to the fire.</P>
<P>NATURE has wi&s;ely ordained that this baneful tree &s;hould be extremely rare, and its &s;ituation the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered from the bu&s;y haunts of men, amid&s;t mountains of difficult acce&s;s, and inhabited by the mo&s;t barbarous tribes; they alone are ac|quainted with the effects that this &s;ubtile poi&s;on has upon the circumambient air, and &s;uch animals as approach its tremendous &s;hade. The atmo&s;phere is here &s;aid to be &s;o infected by the de|leterious quality of the effluvia of this pe&s;tilential tree, that birds which accidentally perch upon its boughs are &s;eized with torpor, and drop down dead. No man dares approach it without his hands, feet, and head being well &s;hrouded with linen cloths; were this precaution neglected, he would become benumbed, and pre&s;ently lo&s;e the u&s;e of his limbs. The dripping of rain water from the tree upon the body, cau&s;es it to &s;well; and &s;hould it fall upon the bare head, the lo&s;s of all the hair would en&s;ue. No other tree can exi&s;t in its vicinity, and the earth be|neath it is parched and withered; &s;o that Death &s;eems emi|nently to have fixed his &s;tation here.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder that the love of the marvellous, natural to mankind, has added &s;omewhat to the truly a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes that the environs of this tree exhibit. Hence the rude nations of this mountanous tract have made it the habitation of a &s;er|pent, who&s;e eyes glare like fire in the night, and remind us of
<PB N="44" REF="52">the fabled gardens of the <HI>He&s;perides</HI> in cla&s;&s;ic lore, who&s;e &s;ta|tionary centinel was a watchful dragon.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> call this tree <HI>Maca&s;&s;erne Gift-boom,</HI> or <HI>Spatten|boom;</HI> and in the <HI>Malaye</HI> language it is termed <HI>Caju-Upas,</HI> that is to &s;ay poi&s;on-tree, and the fruit &s;imply <HI>Upas.</HI> By the people of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> and throughout <HI>Celebes,</HI> both the tree and its poi&s;on are called <HI>Ipo.</HI></P>
<P>THE darts to which the natives apply this poi&s;on, are a foot or eighteen inches in length, very &s;lender, made of reed, or light wood, and armed with the tooth of the <HI>Lamia</HI> &s;hark &s;meared with poi&s;on. The&s;e are fixed in a tube five or &s;ix feet long, and blown by the breath of the a&s;&s;ailant with great force to the di&s;tance of pi&s;tol &s;hot: upon reaching the de&s;tined ob|ject, the barbed tooth adheres, and the wood only can be ex|tracted, or &s;ometimes detaches it&s;elf, and falls to the ground. The effect of the poi&s;on is to produce a &s;en&s;ation of heat in all parts of the body, and oppre&s;&s;ive Vertigo in the head, which is pre&s;ently &s;ucceeded by a total debility, and death within the &s;pace of half an hour is the certain con&s;equence. Nay &s;o rapid are its effects in &s;ome in&s;tances, as to prove fatal in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour. And farther, &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly does its virus pervade the whole human frame, that by experiments made upon malefactors, it has been proved, that if the thumb or the foot only be wounded by the poi&s;onous dart, and am|putation immediately performed upon the affected member, a&s;toni&s;hing to relate! death infallibly en&s;ues.</P>
<P>AFTER a long intercour&s;e, and many bloody conte&s;ts with the
<PB N="45" REF="53">natives of <HI>Celebes,</HI> which may be &s;tiled the <HI>Colchos</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> being an i&s;land noted for many other &s;orts of poi&s;on, the <HI>Dutch</HI> acquired the knowlege of &s;ome &s;pecifics among the in|digenous plants, which di&s;armed this tremendous weapon of much of its terrors. Here are &s;aid to be two &s;pecies of the <HI>Ipo,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of male and female, and that the poi&s;on of the latter is much le&s;s efficacious than that of the for|mer, and u&s;ed chiefly for the de&s;truction of game. The juice is extracted from the tree by piercing the bark of the trunk, and in&s;erting therein long bamboos &s;harpened at the point. Four or five of the&s;e are fixed to one tree, and remain three or four days, that the &s;ap may lei&s;urely di&s;til into them, and when filled they are removed for u&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>N. P. Foer&s;ch,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;urgeon &s;tationed at <HI>Batavia</HI> in 1774, gives the following account of the &s;ituation of the tree, and the manner of collecting the poi&s;on. The reader is left to form a judgment of the writer's authority, and how far his cre|dulity is to be cen&s;ured. "It is," &s;ays he,
<Q>&s;eated about twenty|&s;even leagues from <HI>Soura,</HI> the &s;eat of the emperor, encircled by high hills and mountains, and the country around, to the di&s;tance of ten or twelve miles, has neither tree nor &s;hrub, or even the lea&s;t plant or gra&s;s. I have made the tour all around this dangerous &s;pot, at about eighteen miles di&s;tant from the centre, and I found the a&s;pect of the country on all &s;ides equally dreary. The ea&s;ie&s;t a&s;cent of the hills is from that part where the old eccle&s;ia&s;tic dwells. I had procured a re|commendation from an old <HI>Malayan</HI> prie&s;t, to another prie&s;t who lives on the neare&s;t inhabitable &s;pot to the tree, which is
<PB N="46" REF="54">about fifteen or &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant. The letter proved of great &s;ervice to me in my undertaking, as that prie&s;t is ap|pointed by the emperor to re&s;ide there, to prepare for eternity the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who for different crimes are &s;entenced to approach the tree, and to procure the poi&s;on. From his hou&s;e the criminals are &s;ent for the poi&s;on, into which the points of all warlike in&s;truments are dipped. It is of high value, and produces a con&s;iderable revenue to the emperor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE poi&s;on which is procured from this tree, is a gum that i&s;&s;ues out between the bark and the tree it&s;elf, like the cam|phor. Malefactors, who for their crimes are &s;entenced to die, are the only per&s;ons who fetch the poi&s;on; and this is the only chance they have of &s;aving their lives. After &s;entence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are a&s;ked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they will go to the <HI>Upas</HI> tree for a box of poi&s;on. They commonly prefer the latter propo&s;al, as there is not only &s;ome chance of pre&s;erving their lives, but al&s;o a certainty, in ca&s;e of their &s;afe return, that a provi&s;ion will be made for them in future by the emperor. They are al&s;o permitted to a&s;k a favor from the emperor, which is generally of a trifling nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a &s;ilver or tortoi&s;e&s;hell box, in which they are to put the poi&s;onous gum, and are properly in&s;tructed how to pro|ceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other particulars, they are always told to attend to the direc|tion of the winds; as they are to go towards the tree before the wind, &s;o that the effluvia from the tree are always blown
<PB N="47" REF="55">from them. They are told likewi&s;e to travel with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, as that is the only method of in&s;uring a &s;afe return. They are afterwards &s;ent to the hou&s;e of the old prie&s;t, to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here they generally remain &s;ome days, in expec|tation of a favorable breeze. During that time, the eccle|&s;ia&s;tic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and ad|monitions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHEN the hour of their departure arrives, the prie&s;t puts them on a long leather cap, with two gla&s;&s;es before their eyes, which comes down as far as their brea&s;t; and al&s;o pro|vides them with a pair of leather gloves. They are then conducted by the prie&s;t, and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the prie&s;t repeats his in|&s;tructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He &s;hews them a hill, which they are told to a&s;cend, and that on the other &s;ide they will find a rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the <HI>Upas.</HI> They now take leave of each other; and, amid&s;t prayers for their &s;ucce&s;s, the delinquents ha&s;ten away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE worthy old eccle&s;ia&s;tic has a&s;&s;ured me that during his re&s;idence there for upwards of thirty years, he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed above &s;even hundred criminals in the manner which I have de&s;cribed; and that &s;carcely two out of twenty have returned. He &s;hewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy &s;ufferers, with the date of their departure from his hou&s;e annexed, and a li&s;t of the offences for which they had been condemned; to which was added, a li&s;t of tho&s;e who had returned in &s;afety. I after|wards
<PB N="48" REF="56">&s;aw another li&s;t of the&s;e culprits, at the jail-keeper's at <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> and found that they perfectly corre&s;ponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards obtained.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I WAS pre&s;ent at &s;ome of the&s;e melancholy ceremonies, and de&s;ired different delinquents to bring with them &s;ome pieces of the wood, or a &s;mall branch, or &s;ome leaves of this wonderful tree. I have al&s;o given them &s;ilk cords, de&s;iring them to mea&s;ure its thickne&s;s. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return; and all I could learn from him concerning the tree it&s;elf, was that it &s;tood on the border of a rivulet, as de|&s;cribed by the old prie&s;t; that it was of a middling &s;ize; that five or &s;ix young trees of the &s;ame kind &s;tood clo&s;e by it; but that no other &s;hrub or plant could be &s;een near it; and that the ground was of a browni&s;h &s;and, full of &s;tones, almo&s;t im|practicable for travelling, and covered with dead bodies. After many conver&s;ations with the old <HI>Malayan</HI> prie&s;t, I que&s;|tioned him about the fir&s;t di&s;covery, and a&s;ked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he gave me the following an&s;wer:</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE are told in our new Alcoran, that above an hundred years ago, the country around the tree was inhabited by a people &s;trongly addicted to the &s;ins of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha;</HI> when the great prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> determined not to &s;uffer them to lead &s;uch dete&s;table lives any longer, he applied to <HI>God</HI> to puni&s;h them; upon which <HI>God</HI> cau&s;ed this tree to grow
<PB N="49" REF="57">out of the earth, which de&s;troyed them all, and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SUCH was the <HI>Malayan</HI> opinion. I &s;hall not attempt a com|ment; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve that all the <HI>Malayans</HI> con&s;idered this tree as an holy in&s;trument of the great prophet to puni&s;h the &s;ins of mankind; and therefore to die of the poi&s;on of the <HI>Upas</HI> is generally con&s;idered among them as an honorable death. For that rea&s;on I al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the delinquents who were going to the tree, were generally dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t ap|parel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exi&s;t, but that, in that &s;pace of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been di&s;covered. I have al&s;o been a&s;&s;ured by &s;everal per&s;ons of veracity that there are no fi&s;h in the waters, nor has any rat, mou&s;e, or any other vermin been &s;een there; and when any birds fly &s;o near this tree that the effluvia reaches them, they fall a &s;acrifice to the effects of the poi&s;on. This circum&s;tance has been a&s;certained by different delinquents, who, in their return, have &s;een the birds drop down, and have picked them up dead, and brought them to the old eccle&s;ia&s;tic.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Foer&s;ch</HI> gives us an account of the fatal effects in the fol|lowing melancholy narration.
<Q>In the year 1776, in the month of <HI>February,</HI> I was pre&s;ent at the execution of thirteen of the emperors concubines, at <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> who were convicted of infidelity to the emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair criminals were led into an open &s;pace within the walls of the emperor's palace. There the
<PB N="50" REF="58">judge pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon them, by which they are doomed to &s;uffer death by a lancet poi&s;oned with <HI>Upas.</HI> After this the Alcoran was pre&s;ented to them, and they were, according to the law of their great prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to acknowlege, and to affirm by oath, that the charges brought again&s;t them, together with the &s;entence and their puni&s;hment, were fair and equitable. This they did by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran, their left hands upon their brea&s;ts, and their eyes lifted towards heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they ki&s;&s;ed it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THESE ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his bu&s;ine&s;s in the following manner:&mdash;Thirteen po&s;ts, each about five feet high, had been previou&s;ly erected, to the&s;e the de|linquents were fa&s;tened, and their brea&s;ts &s;tripped naked. In this &s;ituation they remained a &s;hort time in continual prayers, attended by &s;everal prie&s;ts, until a &s;ignal was given by the judge to the executioner, on which the latter produced an in|&s;trument, much like the &s;pring lancet u&s;ed by farriers for bleeding hor&s;es. With this in&s;trument, it being poi&s;oned with the gum of the <HI>Upas,</HI> the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their brea&s;ts, and the operation was performed upon them all in le&s;s than two minutes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>MY a&s;toni&s;hment was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t degree, when I beheld the &s;udden effects of that poi&s;on, for in about five mi|nutes after they were lanced, they were taken with a tremor, attended with a <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> after which they died in the greate&s;t agonies, crying out to GOD and <HI>Mahomet</HI> for mercy. In &s;ixteen minutes by my watch, which I held in my hand, all the criminals were no more; &s;ome hours after
<PB N="51" REF="59">their death, I ob&s;erved their bodies full of livid &s;pots, much like tho&s;e of the <HI>Petechioe,</HI> their faces &s;welled, their color changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the recent information obtained in the cour&s;e of Lord <HI>Macartneys</HI> emba&s;&s;y to <HI>China,</HI> vol. i. p. 272, totally invalidates the authority of <HI>Foer&s;ch,</HI> yet it appears evident that trees of a mo&s;t deleterious nature, and productive of the mo&s;t active poi&s;ons, really exi&s;t in <HI>Java.</HI> Such al&s;o was the opinion of the author of this work, who&s;e depth of judgment placed him far remote from the imputation of credulity; I have therefore ventured, as in other in&s;tances, to publi&s;h a faithful copy of the original manu&s;cript.

<P>IN re&s;pect to the other trees and plants of <HI>Java,</HI> I can only &s;ay that they agree with tho&s;e of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and other i&s;lands of the great <HI>Archipelago.</HI> Mo&s;t will be found in my <HI>Flora Indica.</HI> Let me only remark, that the earlie&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> navigators have
<PB N="52" REF="60">given tolerable de&s;criptions of &s;everal, in the often cited old book publi&s;hed by <HI>Nicholas,</HI> from p. 39 to p. 42, accompanied with plates as expre&s;&s;ive as could be cut on wood.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t i&s;land of <HI>Borneo</HI> is divided from the northern coa&s;t of <HI>Java</HI> by a &s;ound between two and three hundred leagues in breadth.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BORNEO.</NOTE> According to M. <HI>D'Anville</HI>'s &s;cale, the i&s;land is in length from &s;outh to north near three hundred leagues, and its greate&s;t breadth two hundred; the circumference is e&s;timated at two thou&s;and miles; &s;o that it may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t i&s;land in the world. It is of a pyriform &s;hape; its &s;hores rude, with projecting promontories, and is divided by the equator into two unequal portions. The far greater part of <HI>Borneo</HI> next to the &s;ea, e&s;pecially the northern, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;wamps, co|vered with fore&s;ts of trees of numberle&s;s &s;pecies and great &s;izes, which penetrate for &s;cores of miles towards the centre of the i&s;land. The&s;e un&s;table muddy flats are divided by rivers, which branch into multitudes of canals, and are the only roads into the interior parts. Lofty mountains are &s;aid to ri&s;e in the middle of the i&s;land; many are volcanic, and often occa&s;ion tremendous earthquakes.</P>
<P>THIS great i&s;land is little known, except merely on the coa&s;ts, and even tho&s;e remain yet &s;o imperfectly explored, that le&s;s can be &s;aid of it than of many &s;maller tracts. So un&s;table are the &s;wampy out-&s;kirts, that in the attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h factories, the <HI>Europeans</HI> have been obliged to build them on piles driven into the ground; or, after the manner of the country, to erect in the rivers their hou&s;es on po&s;ts, fixed to floats formed of bodies of great trees, and tho&s;e moored by rattans to tho&s;e growing on &s;hore, to prevent their being carried away by the floods. In
<PB N="53" REF="61">&s;uch a manner are many of the towns of <HI>Borneo</HI> con&s;tructed; they ri&s;e and fall with the tide, which here flows but once in the twenty-four hours, and that only in the day. At &s;pring tide, the&s;e towns on the <HI>Banjar</HI> river experience the ri&s;e and fall of twelve feet.</P>
<P>THE whole coa&s;ts are in the hands of <HI>Malayans, Moors,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">INHABITANTS.</NOTE> <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ars,</HI> and even <HI>Japane&s;e,</HI> who have perhaps for centuries driven the antient inhabitants into the interior parts. The aborigines are of a black complexion, a middle &s;tature, with long and black hair, and generally better featured than the <HI>Guinea Negroes,</HI> feeble in their bodies, and very indolent and inactive. The women &s;mall, hand&s;ome, and of a better color than the men. Their general religion is of a mongrel kind of <HI>Mahometani&s;m.</HI> The&s;e maintain a feudal government under chieftains, mi&s;|called by our &s;ailors, kings. The &s;eat of the principal is at <HI>Tatas,</HI> near to <HI>Bandar Ma&s;&s;een,</HI> &s;ome miles up the country on the northern &s;ide, and &s;eated on a great river, which for many miles is twice as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and bounded by trees of mo&s;t &s;tupendous height. It is navigable far beyond <HI>Bandar Ma&s;&s;een</HI> for the large&s;t &s;hips, and is greatly frequented by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> jonks; the river is called <HI>China</HI> for that rea&s;on. We are not acquainted with the length of its navi|gation; but it ri&s;es in the very middle of the i&s;land, and runs all the way due &s;outh. On this river we attempted to form a &s;ettle|ment under the Mr. <HI>Cunningham</HI> we have before mentioned; but by &s;ome imprudencies gave offence to the inhabitants, and the greater part of our people were ma&s;&s;acred. The &s;ame fate has attended other factories of different <HI>European</HI> nations who
<PB N="54" REF="62">have endeavored to form &s;ettlements at <HI>Succadana, Samba,</HI> and many other places. <HI>Tatas</HI> has its &s;ultan. The&s;e &s;overeigns com|mand the trade of the i&s;land, and furni&s;h the <HI>European</HI> &s;hips, who happen to arrive, with cargoes of pepper, the &s;taple of the country; that article is brought down from the interior parts, and &s;old to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or to the commercial <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> nations.</P>
<P>IT is to Captain <HI>Daniel Beeckman</HI> that we owe the be&s;t ac|count of <HI>Borneo;</HI> he vi&s;ited it in the beginning of this cen|tury, and publi&s;hed his account in the year 1718. At p. 36 he gives the following li&s;t of the productions of the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCTIONS OF.</NOTE> which abounds with pepper, the be&s;t dragon's blood, bezoar, mo&s;t ex|cellent camphor, pine apples, citrons, oranges, lemons, water melons, mu&s;k melons, plantains, banana, coco nuts, and all &s;orts of fruit that are generally found in any part of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies;</HI> the mountains yield diamonds, gold, tin and iron; the fore&s;ts, honey, cotton, deer, goats, buffaloes, wild oxen, wild hogs, &s;mall hor&s;es, bears, tigers, elephants, and a multitude of monkies.</P>
<P>THE pepper grows far up the country,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPER.</NOTE> and is collected by the very poore&s;t people only; they have all the different &s;orts, black, white, and long.</P>
<P><HI>Sanguis Draconis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANGUIS DRACONIS.</NOTE> or dragon's blood, is a gum, the exudation of certain trees, of a bloody color. There is a conjecture that this is the <HI>Cinnaberis</HI> of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> lib. v. c. 69. <HI>Pliny,</HI> lib. xxxiii. c. 7, &s;ays that the name is <HI>Indian;</HI> and then fables, that it is the <HI>Sanies</HI> of the dragon oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of an ele|phant expiring with the bite, and that the <HI>Cinnaberis</HI> is the mixed blood of each animal. The antients procured under this notion the real drug, and u&s;ed it in medicine. It was often adul|terated
<PB N="55" REF="63">with the blood of goats; the genuine kind was &s;old at a great rate.</P>
<P>THE trees or &s;hrubs which we know to produce this medi|cine in our di&s;pen&s;atory are the <HI>Dracaena Draco,</HI> of which <HI>Van|delli</HI> has given a good figure in his monograph on the &s;ubject. According to <HI>Kaempfer, Amoen. Exot.</HI> 554, another of the ve|getables it is extracted from is a <HI>Palmapinus Rottani D&s;ierenang,</HI> one of the <HI>Rotangs</HI> de&s;cribed by <HI>Rumphius</HI> under the name of <HI>Palmijuncus Draco,</HI> v. p. 115 tab. 58. fig. 1. This grows in the thick and almo&s;t impervious fore&s;ts of <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER kind is the produce of the <HI>Santalum Rubrum,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SANDAL WOOD.</NOTE> or <HI>Red Sanders;</HI> and again, from the <HI>Dracoena Terminalis</HI> of <HI>Lin|naeus, Rumph.</HI> iv. p. 18. tab. 34, called in <HI>Ternate, Nga&s;&s;i,</HI> or <HI>Ha&s;&s;i.</HI> This &s;pecies grows in <HI>Borneo,</HI> and bears a fruit, &s;ays <HI>Beeckman,</HI> as red as a cherry; the juice, the be&s;t in the world, is extracted from the tree, and the color tried by rubbing it on paper. The natives bring it in drops, wrapped in leaves; but are &s;o apt to adulterate it, that we do not chu&s;e to purcha&s;e without previous examination.</P>
<P>ANOTHER kind is procured from the <HI>Gladiolus Odoratus In|dicus, Rumph.</HI> v. p. 185. tab. 73. For further accounts I mu&s;t re|fer to that <HI>Pliny</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> in the places cited, to vol. ii. p. 252.; and to <HI>Kaempfer,</HI> 551 to 557. The drug, from what&s;o|ever tree or plant it be gotten, maintains its place in our di&s;|pen&s;atory.</P>
<P>AT times a con&s;iderable quantity of gold has been brought here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> which is found in the mines in the interior parts of the country. Some is melted into bars, and u&s;ually adulterated by a
<PB N="56" REF="64">cover of ba&s;e metal. The natives have a very ju&s;t notion of the lord of the <HI>irritamenta malorum,</HI> for they &s;ay, that the devil is &s;ole ma&s;ter of the gold and diamond mines.</P>
<P>DIAMONDS form another article of commerce,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">DIAMONDS.</NOTE> but they are far le&s;s valuable than tho&s;e of <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>BEES-WAX,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEES-WAX.</NOTE> in cakes of about thirty-four pounds, is common at <HI>Sambas,</HI> which being the common money of that part of the i&s;land, was wont to be bartered with the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> for various ne|ce&s;&s;aries. Pearls of con&s;iderable beauty are &s;aid to be another article of exchange in the &s;ame country.</P>
<P>THE bezoar found in the monkies has a mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious value,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BEZOAR.</NOTE> and is &s;old for four or five times its weight in &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THE unrefined camphor of <HI>Borneo,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAMPHOR.</NOTE> is reckoned &s;uperior to any in the world. We are not acquainted with the tree which produces that valuable drug.</P>
<P>THE edible (&s;wallows) ne&s;ts are found in va&s;t abundance;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">EDIBLE NESTS.</NOTE> and the <HI>Bambu</HI> walking canes, form two other articles of trade.</P>

<P>THE aborigines of <HI>Borneo</HI> are called <HI>Byajos;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BYAJOS.</NOTE> they inhabit the interior parts, live under chieftains, and are an independent people, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their proper language and religion; the la&s;t is called <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> yet they pay no re&s;pect to idols; but offer &s;a|crifices of &s;weet &s;cented wood to one &s;upreme beneficent Deity, who in other worlds rewards the ju&s;t and puni&s;hes the wicked. They marry only one wife, are &s;trictly faithful to their nuptial vows, and have the character of general hone&s;ty. Mr. <HI>Beeckman</HI> makes a different report, but fairly confe&s;&s;es that he received it from the <HI>Banjareens,</HI> who will not &s;uffer the <HI>Europeans</HI> to have any intercour&s;e with the natives, and tell many frightful tales of their barbarity. The <HI>Byajos</HI> often come down the river to the port of <HI>Ma&s;&s;een,</HI> in ill &s;haped praws, with gold du&s;t, diamonds, rattans, bezoar, and other articles of commerce, of which the <HI>Banjareens</HI> are &s;ole factors, and con&s;equently highly intere&s;ted in keeping the pretended &s;avages from our knowlege.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Byajos</HI> are taller and &s;tronger than the other inhabitants; they go naked, excepting a &s;mall wrapper about their loins;
<PB N="58" REF="66">they &s;tain their bodies with blue, and by weights affixed to their ears when young, &s;tretch them till they fall on their &s;houlders. The chieftains pull out their fore teeth, and &s;ub&s;titute others of gold, and by way of ornament fling &s;trings of tigers teeth round their necks and bodies. Their arms are lances and poi&s;oned arrows; &s;ome of them lead a piratical life in the great rivers, and are mo&s;t formidable enemies.</P>

<P>IN the mountanous parts of the i&s;lands are remnants of the original inhabitants,

<P>THESE men are &s;trongly made,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CURLED HEADED INDIANS.</NOTE> of haggard countenances, black,
<PB N="67" REF="75">with curled hair like the negroes, and called by the <HI>Spaniards, Negrillos.</HI> They certainly are of the &s;ame race as the <HI>Papuans</HI> or people of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> who might originally have &s;pread them&s;elves over this tract.

<P>THERE are other <HI>Indians</HI> that profe&s;s a &s;ort of dependency on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and have an <HI>Alcayde</HI> among them; yet their manners are barbarous; they are brave, but ferocious; and ap|pear to have been de&s;cended from the <HI>Malayans,</HI> &s;ettled here in very early times.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATURAL HISTORY.</NOTE> It is not to be wondered that in one &s;o abundant in volcanoes, there &s;hould be found &s;prings of hot water. The mo&s;t noted is that which appears two leagues from

The natives &s;old it to them in plenty, for which rea&s;on they made it the general name of the i&s;lands.</P>
<P><HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Grafton</HI> i&s;les are very lofty,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SINGULAR VILLAGES.</NOTE> with a nume|rous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of precipices one above another. On the&s;e the natives build their villages, which affords the &s;ingular pro&s;pect
<PB N="69" REF="77">of three or four rows of &s;mall hou&s;es, erected on po&s;ts, and wattled with boughs. They have no other way of getting to their habitations but by a ladder, which is pulled up after them, if they mean to a&s;cend to the upper villages, or to &s;ecure them|&s;elves from an a&s;&s;ault. The&s;e two i&s;lands are the mo&s;t populous, as they have more of the&s;e precipices. <HI>Ba&s;hee</HI> i&s;land has but one precipice, and in con&s;equence only one town. <HI>Orange</HI> is lofty, yet &s;o plain as to furni&s;h no &s;pot &s;itted for the &s;ite of their villages, and is therefore uninhabited.</P>
<P>THE produce of the&s;e i&s;lands are a few of the tropical fruits,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRODUCE.</NOTE> pine apples, &s;ugar canes, plantains, bananas, calaba&s;hes, yams, and potatoes. The&s;e are planted in the vallies, which are well watered with &s;mall &s;treams; they are al&s;o well wooded, but the trees do not grow to any large &s;ize.

<P>THE natives are &s;hort and &s;quat, round vi&s;aged,

<P>THEIR government is quite patriarchal;

<P>IN general the men went naked, excepting the u&s;ual wrapper about their loins; &s;ome had jackets of plantain leaves; the rude&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Dampier,</HI> of all clothing. The women had a &s;trong thick &s;hort petticoat of cotton, made of the le&s;&s;er cotton plant, the pro|duct of their own i&s;les.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOLD.</NOTE> like the paler gold, it faded with time, but the natives re|&s;tored it to its original brightne&s;s, by &s;mearing it over with a red earth, and flinging it into a fire till it was red hot. Our na|vigator had no means of proving whether it was gold.</P>
<P>To the women was left the care of the plantations.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOATS.</NOTE> The men were engaged in fi&s;hing; they built with much &s;kill their &s;mall boats, which re&s;embled the <HI>Deal</HI> yawls, formed of very narrow planks, fa&s;tened with pins and nails.

<P>THE <HI>White Turtle, Sonnerat,</HI> Voy. <HI>N. Guinea,</HI> tab. 20, is of a mo&s;t glo&s;&s;y whitene&s;s, with a blood-red &s;pot on the brea&s;t, as if it had received a &s;tab in that part.

<P>THE <HI>Shrike,</HI> tab. 25, flies &s;wiftly in the air, and can balance it&s;elf like a &s;wallow; is an inveterate enemy to the raven, which it never fails to attack, and in the end to put to flight.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Antique Shrike,</HI> tab. 114, is &s;ingular for the great hook of its upper mandible hanging far over the lower.</P>
<P><HI>Parrots</HI> are very numerous, and of various &s;pecies; they en|liven the woods with their brilliant colors, and deafen people by their cries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jacana,</HI> tab. 45, is mo&s;t remarkable, not only by the va&s;t length of toes and claws, characters of the genus, but by the

<P>THE bird called by M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> p. 86. tab. 49, <HI>Le Paon Sau|vage de l'i&s;le de Lucon,</HI> is evidently a plover; the bill is long, a little thicker near the point; on the head is a very long cre&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing horizontal far beyond the hind part of the head, and ending in a point; things naked far above the knee; it has only three toes, and tho&s;e are nearly &s;emi-palmated; cre&s;t, head, neck, and brea&s;t, bright grey, barred with black; the top of the cre&s;t quite black; belly white; back, wings, and tail plain brown; length from the tip of the tail to the end three feet.

<P>THE above, and two &s;pecies hereafter to be mentioned, are natives of the&s;e i&s;lands and of the <HI>Moluccas;</HI> their food is fruit; they inhabit the highe&s;t trees, and are the grote&s;que birds of the <HI>Indian</HI> archipelagos.</P>

<P>THE celebrated <HI>bread fruit</HI>

<P><HI>Dampier,</HI> i. 296, fir&s;t di&s;covered it in <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>La|drone</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="88">i&s;lands, and gives a very faithful de&s;cription of the fruit and its u&s;es; Lord <HI>An&s;on,</HI> and his great follower <HI>Cook,</HI> are full of its prai&s;es. Of late years we caught the benevolent idea of tran&s;|porting this tree of life to our own i&s;lands; captain <HI>Bligh</HI> had the honor of being the per&s;on deputed to convey this manna to our wretched negroes. A Satan counteracted (under the feigned form and name of the mo&s;t beneficent of &s;ects) this great benefit to our hard-fated brethren; like his great prototype he &s;ucceeded in the on&s;et, but the adventure is re&s;umed under the au&s;pices of the &s;ame faithful leader, and I hope that I do not make a fal&s;e prophecy if I pre&s;age &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS fruit is the bread of the i&s;lands on which it has been be|&s;towed; it grows on a tree of the &s;ize of a middling oak, and to the bulk of a child's head, and even to the diameter of twelve inches. <HI>Rumphius</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes the varieties into <HI>Grano&s;us, Lano|&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Socco&s;us;</HI> the fir&s;t is the parent tree, and has in it &s;eeds. <HI>John Reinhold For&s;ter,</HI> plate 51. a. gives us an idea of the whole fruit, with the rind hexagonally reticulated; the majority have no &s;eeds, as we find is often the ca&s;e with the <HI>Barberry,</HI> and a few other fruits; the&s;e, therefore, are incapable of propagation, ex|cept by &s;uckers. In the generality of the i&s;lands, the &s;eeded &s;ort is quite lo&s;t, the other kind cultivated in orchards. The account of the fruit as given by <HI>Dampier, abnormis &s;apiens,</HI> is worthy the reader's attention;
<Q>When it is ripe it is yellow and &s;oft, and the ta&s;te is &s;weet and plea&s;ant; the natives of this i&s;land u&s;e it for bread: they gather it when full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in an oven, which &s;corcheth the rind, and makes it black, but they &s;crape off the out&s;ide black cru&s;t,
<PB N="81" REF="89">and there remains a tender thin cru&s;t, and the in&s;ide of it &s;oft, tender, and white, like the crumbs of a penny loaf. There is neither &s;eed nor &s;tone in the in&s;ide, but all is of a pure &s;ub|&s;tance like bread; it mu&s;t be eaten new, for if it is kept above twenty-four hours, it becomes dry, and eats har&s;h and choaky, but it is very plea&s;ant before it is too &s;tale. This fruit la&s;ts in &s;ea&s;on eight months in the year, during which time the na|tives eat no other &s;ort of food of bread kind.</Q></P>
<P>THE fruit which M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> p. 99, calls <HI>Le Rima, ou fruit a pain,</HI> and which he has engaven in tab. 57. 58. 59. and 60, is the perfect fruit, or <HI>&s;occus grano&s;us.</HI> Ju&s;t beneath the rind is a &s;eries of large almond-like kernels, adhering to a central placenta, and of a farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance, which when roa&s;ted eat like che&s;|nuts. The fruit it&s;elf is large and &s;pherical; the natives of the <HI>Philippines</HI> cut it into &s;lices, dry and eat it like bread; it will keep two years. This is the variety Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> calls the <HI>Ducdu,</HI> and &s;eems to make it a &s;eparate &s;pecies.</P>
<P>A MINUTE orange, tab. 63,

<P>BETWEEN the &s;outh end of <HI>Mindanao,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SOOLO ISLES.</NOTE> and the north-ea&s;t point of <HI>Borneo,</HI> is a chain of &s;mall i&s;les, extending about two hundred miles in length, called the <HI>Soolo,</HI> from the name of the chief i&s;land. The principal was about the middle of this cen|tury governed by a &s;ultan, according to M. <HI>Sonnerat,</HI> the very counterpart of <HI>Peter</HI> the Great; endowed with the &s;ame abilities, the &s;ame thir&s;t after knowlege, and the &s;ame ambition of ap|plying it to the improvement of his &s;ubjects. Like <HI>Peter,</HI> he quitted his throne, and took to travelling during &s;everal years. He went afterwards to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where he concealed his name and quality, and a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the common &s;ailors to learn their bu&s;ine&s;s. He next changed his company for that of the carpenters, to be in&s;tructed in their art. He bought tools of all &s;orts, and in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, and then returned to his throne. Still he wi&s;hed for more intellectual improvement; &s;ailed for <HI>Mecca</HI> to learn the law of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the <HI>Arabic</HI> tongue, brought home the u&s;e of let|ters, and introduced money, the fir&s;t ever known in the i&s;lands.</P>
<P>THIS monarch obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by conque&s;t of a &s;mall part of <HI>Borneo</HI> next to his dominions, which involved him in a quar|rel with &s;ome <HI>Dutch,</HI> who pretended they were allies to the <HI>Bornoe&s;e.</HI> Our prince found he never could be a match for the&s;e people without the u&s;e of fire-arms. He fitted out a few &s;hips, loaded them with articles of commerce, and &s;ailed to <HI>Manilla,</HI> in
<PB N="83" REF="91">order to &s;upply his wants. The rapacious governor &s;eized on the monarch and all his trea&s;ure, under pretence that he intended the conque&s;t of the i&s;land. The &s;ultan remon&s;trated in vain, he endured a long captivity; his &s;ubjects, enraged at the treatment their prince had met with, made horrible ravages on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Luconia.</HI> The governor did not dare to complain, as he knew his court would not approve his conduct. He &s;tipulated with the prince that he would re&s;tore him to liberty, provided he would con&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h in his dominions a mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;uits. He refu&s;ed to comply; the Je&s;uits, determined on revenge and con|que&s;t, obtained an armament, and taking the <HI>Soolo</HI> monarch, &s;ailed for <HI>Sambouange,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Soolo,</HI> where they landed, and laid &s;iege to the only fort on the i&s;land. The warriors of <HI>Soolo</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed them, and drove them with di&s;grace to their &s;hips. At <HI>Sambouange</HI> he found means to e&s;cape on board an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ve&s;&s;el, which conveyed him to <HI>Soolo;</HI> his &s;ubjects crowded to him, and he remounted his throne, to the great joy of his people; he ceded a &s;mall i&s;land to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and declared his ports open to all piratical adventurers, to encourage them to re|venge his cau&s;e on the treacherous <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Mr. <HI>Forre&s;t</HI> vi|&s;ited this i&s;land, and found there an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> factor; it was then governed by <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;on of the captive &s;ultan, who had received his education at <HI>Manilla.</HI></P>

<PB N="84" REF="92">&s;cientifically, I am at a lo&s;s to define the kinds, except|ing the <HI>Mytilus Margaritiferus;</HI> every one of the&s;e &s;hells have in them two &s;mall lob&s;ters, to which the <HI>Indians</HI> attribute the formation of the pearls.

It abounds with rivers, which &s;pring high in the mountains, and precipitate down va&s;t rocks, among a &s;ylvan &s;cene of lofty and &s;ingular trees. The lakes, and more &s;till parts of the rivers, give &s;ecurity to numberle&s;s water fowl of the larger and more clum&s;y kinds, which retire there by fear of the crocodiles, which haunt the lower and mar&s;hy parts. Tho&s;e are not de&s;erted by the le&s;&s;er palmated birds, &s;uch as ducks and teal, which being quick &s;ighted and nimble, ea&s;ily evade the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS i&s;land was di&s;covered in 1525, by <HI>Antonio de Britto</HI> and <HI>Garcias Henriguez,</HI> who at that time commanded in the <HI>Moluc|cas. Celebes</HI> was reckoned one of the greate&s;t of tho&s;e i&s;lands. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves here, and whether their conduct was more moderate than in other places I know not, but they gained the good opinion of the inhabitants, who pre|&s;erved towards them the mo&s;t inviolable fidelity. They kept their ground here till the year 1660, when the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with a &s;trong
<PB N="87" REF="95">&s;quadron, landed and defeated them, and their faithful ally the king of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> a potent prince on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and near the &s;outhern end. Here the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had their colony. The <HI>Dutch</HI> expelled them, ra&s;ed their churches to the ground, and &s;eized all the effects of the Je&s;uits, whom they ju&s;tly con|&s;idered as their greate&s;t enemies. The king made one more at|tempt to expel the&s;e invaders; but was un&s;ucce&s;sful, and obliged to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Batavian</HI> yoke. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had al&s;o for a long time great intercour&s;e with this i&s;land, for the &s;ake of the rich productions of the <HI>Spicy i&s;les,</HI> till at length the &s;ubtile <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ucceeded in preventing all commerce with <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> have now the monarch of this i&s;land, and all its other princes, at their command, &s;o they may more truly be &s;aid to be the governors of the country. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are the only people who are per|mitted to trade here to &s;upply the wants of the i&s;landers. The <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars</HI> have a great commercial fi&s;hery around their i&s;land; they go in fleets of more than a hundred &s;ail, which con&s;i&s;t of proas from twelve to twenty tons burden, and carry from &s;ixteen to twenty men; they go out with one mon&s;oon, and come in with another, and &s;end their fi&s;h to the <HI>China</HI> market; the produce of its own &s;eas not being equal to the demand of that over&s;tocked empire. It is remarkable that all the&s;e proas carry <HI>Dutch</HI> colors.

Mr. <HI>Carte|ret,</HI> by amazing re&s;olution, at length got leave to anchor and procure refre&s;hments in <HI>Bonthain</HI> bay, about thirty miles from the capital.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> There can be no doubt but our appearance was very ho&s;tile; they were diffident of us to the highe&s;t degree, declined all intercour&s;e, and refu&s;ed all our pre&s;ents: our navigators certainly did not u&s;e the arts of con|ciliating their affections. After frequently treating them with a volley of &s;mall &s;hots on their legs, or more mu&s;cular parts, we are not to wonder at their di&s;like to the &s;trangers who had vi&s;ited their coa&s;ts. Their wants, by rea&s;on of the happine&s;s of the climate, did not demand cloathing, and their minds were &s;u|perior to the accepting of gew-gaws; but they were frequently pre&s;&s;ed by hunger.</P>

<PB N="107" REF="114">the gra&s;s that &s;urrounded our tents: they were brave to a degree of temerity; two have been known to oppo&s;e the landing of forty of our people: their offen&s;ive weapons were &s;words made of &s;ome hard wood, and darts or lances, armed at the end with fi&s;hes bones, or the &s;pine of the &s;ting rays; their defen&s;ive arms a round buckler. They were painted like the people of <HI>Van Diemen</HI>'s land, and as an additional ornament, had a great bone of &s;ome bird &s;tuck through their no&s;es, and another through each car.

<P>THESE people, &s;avage as they may &s;eem, are not ignorant of the rudiments of drawing; Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. to Botany Bay, p. 106.</NOTE> ob&s;erved on many of the rocks figures of animals, &s;hields, weapons, and even men; and one in particular of a man beginning to dance, and this in rather a &s;uperior &s;tyle: &s;urely it mu&s;t be admitted that people thus tinctured with a liberal art, are capable of civilization under proper treatment.</P>

<P>THEIR food are fi&s;h, &s;hell fi&s;h, or any thing they can collect on the &s;hores. They have a mo&s;t artle&s;s &s;pecies of canoe, made of bark, &s;tretched on a frame, and tied together at each
<PB N="108" REF="115">end; two, &s;ometimes more, will venture in one of them; they keep along the &s;hoals to &s;trike the fi&s;h, which appears to be their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; they al&s;o eat the fowls, or the few quadrupeds they can contrive to take. On many of the tall trees were cut notches in the &s;tems to facilitate their a&s;cent. They &s;eemed to conceal them&s;elves on the top, and by that means &s;urpri&s;e the birds as they alight, or catch them at roo&s;t; or from this &s;ituation, kill with their lances any bea&s;t that chances to pa&s;s beneath. As to their cookery, they content them&s;elves with eating their meat raw, or at be&s;t with giving it a &s;light broiling over their fires.</P>
<P>THE country is hilly, but not mountanous; part covered with tall trees, quite clear from underwood; in &s;ome parts near the &s;hores, were exten&s;ive tracts hid by bru&s;hwood; and in many places &s;wamps full of the <HI>Mangrove,</HI> or <HI>Rhizophora mangle</HI>

The trees were filled with birds of mo&s;t beautiful colors, particularly tho&s;e of the parrot tribe. The country abounded with plants, and from that circum&s;tance the harbor was called <HI>Botany Bay.</HI> All this coa&s;t was named <HI>New South Wales,</HI> from the extreme &s;outh to the extreme north; a denomination given near two centuries ago to part of the territories adjacent to <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s bay.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">GOVERNOR PHILLIP.</NOTE> and for &s;ome time was engaged in the &s;ervice of <HI>Portugal,</HI> during part of which he with great good conduct and humanity per|formed a duty &s;imilar to that his country now committed to him; for he was employed once, if not oftener, in conveying the criminals of that nation to its colonies of the <HI>Brazils.</HI></P>
<P>THE governor &s;ailed from <HI>Spithead</HI> on <HI>May</HI> 13th, 1787. On <HI>June</HI> 3d he and his fleet reached <HI>Teneriff;</HI> on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5th an|chored off <HI>Rio de Janeiro;</HI> on <HI>October</HI> 13th in <HI>Table Bay,</HI> at the cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> which he left on <HI>November</HI> 12th in the <HI>Supply;</HI> reached <HI>Botany Bay</HI> on <HI>January</HI> 3d, 1788, having per|formed, in a bad &s;ailer, a voyage of &s;even thou&s;and miles in fifty|one days; the <HI>Syrius</HI> and the whole convoy anchored safely in the bay on the 19th and 20th of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>IT is a popular opinion that the expence of tran&s;portation of the convicts amounted to three hundred pounds a man, including the provi&s;ion made for their cloathing and &s;upport for &s;ome &s;mall time after their landing. I was in hopes that two pamphlets, publi&s;hed by <HI>Debrett</HI> in 1791, 1792, under authority of govern|ment,
<PB N="110" REF="117">would have confirmed or refuted the report, e&s;pecially as one of them pretended to give an account of the expences; but the detail is &s;o very imperfect, that I am not able to &s;atisfy either my own or the reader's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Phillip</HI> had previou&s;ly taken a mo&s;t exact &s;urvey of every part of the propo&s;ed place of &s;ettlement; he found it bad as a port, and from the wet nature of the environs, &s;u&s;|pected that the air would affect the health of the new co|loni&s;ts. He ob&s;erved that Captain <HI>Cook</HI> mentioned a bay, in Lat. 33&deg; 5&prime; &s;outh, very little di&s;tant from the other, which he had named <HI>Port Jack&s;on,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT JACK|SON.</NOTE> and where he thought there was good anchorage. Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> lo&s;t no time, but made a thorough ex|amination of that al&s;o; he found it equal at lea&s;t to our celebrated harbor, <HI>Milford Haven,</HI> in old <HI>South Wales.</HI> It opens with an ample mouth, and after &s;ome &s;pace, divides into two mo&s;t exten|&s;ive meandering branches, with numbers of other &s;mall bays, creeks, or coves, pointing again to the right and to the left, &s;o as to form the fine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecure harbor in the world, capable of containing the navies of <HI>Europe</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>HERE Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> determined to e&s;tabli&s;h his colony;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SYDNEY COVE.</NOTE> and fixing on a place which he named <HI>Sydney Cove,</HI> began immedi|ately to trace the outlines of the fir&s;t &s;treet of his intended town. The officers live in huts, but hou&s;es are building of brick and &s;tone; the governor is very moderate in that de&s;igned for him|&s;elf, which contains only &s;ix rooms. The land allotted for cul|tivation has been found to be very good, and to return on the fir&s;t trial two hundred bu&s;hels of wheat, and &s;ixty of

There are al&s;o vegetables in plenty, from &s;eeds brought from <HI>England.</HI> I cannot enter into the account of the whole proceed|ings; by the detail given in the two pamphlets publi&s;hed by <HI>J. Debrett,</HI> imperfect as they are, may be &s;een the humanity of government in providing every nece&s;&s;ary for the u&s;e of the con|victs, yet I fear it has been di&s;appointed in its hopes. The im|men&s;e expence we have been at in &s;ending provi&s;ions from hence, from the cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and from <HI>China</HI> (notwith&s;tanding the glo&s;&s;ing over &s;everal particulars) gives rea&s;on to imagine that our colony has been at the point of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Kangaroo,</HI> and others of the Opo&s;&s;um tribe, may be eaten, but tho&s;e animals, which never were numerous, will &s;oon become extinct in the neighborhood of the colony, and we dare
<PB N="112" REF="119">not, for fear of the natives, tre&s;pa&s;s beyond our bounds; the <HI>New Hollanders</HI> &s;till continue very ho&s;tile. Fi&s;h is found in plenty, but the turtle, on which we &s;eemed to have &s;ome dependence, is a very precarious article.</P>
<P>THE colony looks up for &s;upport to a little &s;pot called <HI>Norfolk I&s;land,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NORFOLK ISLAND.</NOTE> in Lat. 29&deg; &s;outh, Long. 168&deg; ea&s;t. It contains from twelve to thirteen thou&s;and acres, and does not exceed in circumference &s;ixteen miles, is very mountanous, and covered with a thick wood, choaked up with underwood; it is &s;urrounded with cliffs forty fathoms high, and quite perpendicular, excepting at a few creeks, dignified with the name of bays, to which often a raging &s;urf denies all approach.</P>
<P>THE i&s;land is happy in many &s;treams of fine water, &s;ome co|pious enough to turn a mill. The mold, in places freed by our people from trees, is the riche&s;t and deepe&s;t in the world; abun|dance of pumice-&s;tones and porous red <HI>lava</HI> is &s;cattered over its &s;urface, and even mixed with the &s;oil, giving &s;trong rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it to have been of volcanic origin.</P>
<P>A SMALL colony was detached,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">COLONIZED.</NOTE> on <HI>February</HI> 14th, 1788, from <HI>Jack&s;on Port</HI> to this i&s;land, in hopes of its contributing in time to the &s;upport of the parent &s;tate. It con&s;i&s;ted only of a &s;u|baltern officer, a &s;urgeon, two men who under&s;tood the cultiva|tion and dre&s;&s;ing of flax, nine male and &s;ix female convicts; and over them was appointed Lieutenant <HI>King,</HI> of the navy, &s;ole go|vernor of this &s;ea-girt reign. With his little colony he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ingular interval of above two years, till he received, on <HI>March</HI> 6th, 1790, a mighty reinforcement of two companies of marines, five men and three women from the civil department,
<PB N="113" REF="120">and a hundred and &s;ixteen male and &s;ixty-&s;even female convicts. This detachment &s;owed wheat and barley from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and got in their harve&s;t in <HI>December,</HI> which produced twenty|five fold. Mayz &s;ucceeds well; the &s;ugar-cane, vines, and oranges thrive exceedingly; and potatoes produce two crops in a year. All kinds of garden plants come to good perfection. The rat (its only quadruped) was at fir&s;t a pe&s;t to the colony. If this i&s;le proves the nur&s;ing mother to our e&s;tabli&s;hment at <HI>Port Jack&s;on,</HI> as the i&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> or <HI>M&ocirc;n mam Cymru,</HI> is &s;aid to have been to <HI>Wales,</HI> I &s;hall think it the prodigy of the age.</P>

<P>THESE are the only plants which the &s;paring communications of our philo&s;ophical travellers will permit us to mention. The la&s;t is of the greate&s;t importance to the natives, and may hereafter become &s;o to every nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it produces the be&s;t and mo&s;t tenacious hemp in the world. I &s;hall deliver the de&s;crip|tion and hi&s;tory of it, borrowed from vol. iii. p. 39. of Captain <HI>Cook</HI>'s Fir&s;t Voyage: "There is," &s;ays our great navigator,
<Q>however, a plant that &s;erves the inhabitants in&s;tead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the &s;ame purpo&s;es in the world. Of this plant there are two &s;orts; the leaves of both re&s;emble tho&s;e of flags, but their flowers are &s;maller and their clu&s;ters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of the&s;e plants, with very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of the&s;e they al&s;o make their &s;trings, lines, and cordage for every purpo&s;e, which are &s;o much &s;tronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a compa|ri&s;on.
<PB N="117" REF="124">From the &s;ame plant, by another preparation, they draw long &s;lender fibres, which &s;hine like &s;ilk, and are as white as &s;now; of the&s;e, which are al&s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;trong, the finer cloths are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than &s;plitting them into proper breadths and tying the &s;trips together, they make their fi&s;hing nets; &s;ome of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enor|mous &s;ize.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Norfolk I&s;land</HI> is peculiarly happy in its climate:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CLIMATE.</NOTE> the air is pure, &s;alubrious, and delicious, freed from exce&s;&s;ive heat by the con&s;tant breezes from the &s;ea; and of &s;o mild a temperature throughout the winter, that there is a perpetual vegetation; crop &s;ucceeds crop, and the refre&s;hing &s;howers maintain a con|&s;tant verdure: &s;ometimes there are great droughts. From <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> to <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> may be called the rainy &s;ea&s;on; not that it is regular, for there is &s;ometimes fine weather for a fortnight to|gether, but when the rain does fall, it is in torrents.</P>

<P>RAYS are very numerous, and of &s;everal kinds, in all the &s;hal|lows of this coa&s;t; &s;ome weigh near three hundred pounds. A &s;pecies of &s;ting-ray is very common, and furni&s;hes, with its &s;pines, the head of one of the mo&s;t dreaded weapons of the natives.</P>

<P>THE yellow gum plant of <HI>Phillip,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">YELLOW GUM TREE.</NOTE> p. 60. tab. 3, grows in form of a <HI>yucca;</HI> has a &s;tem of con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, &s;caled regu|larly; the leaves are very long, out of their middle ri&s;es the fructification, on a &s;lender &s;tem, twelve or fourteen feet high; of this the natives &s;ometimes make &s;pears.

<P>THE <HI>Peppermint Tree,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PEPPERMINT TREE.</NOTE> the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Eucaliptus obliqua</HI> of <HI>L'Heretier, Sert. Angl.</HI> p. 18, grows to the height of a hundred feet, and thirty in girth

The oil extracted from the leaves is &s;o like that which is drawn from our peppermint, that Mr. <HI>White</HI> called the tree by that name.

<P>THE <HI>Tea Tree</HI> of the &s;ame author, p. 229. tab. 24,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TEA TREE.</NOTE> is of the genus of <HI>Melaleuca.</HI> Mr. <HI>White</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it to be the &s;ame with the <HI>Camunium</HI> of <HI>Rumph. Amboin.</HI> v. p. 29. tab. 18, which grows in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Amboina.</HI></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">RED GUM TREE.</NOTE> p. 231. tab. 25; grows to the &s;ize of our large &s;toaks; the wood is brittle, and good for nothing but fuel; it contains a va&s;t quantity of red gum, like the gum <HI>Kino.</HI> Some of our voyagers compare it to gum dragon. A &s;ingle tree, on inci&s;ion, will yield &s;ixty gallons. It di&s;&s;olves almo&s;t entirely in &s;pirits of wine, and gives them a red color. In dy&s;enteries (which our convicts were much af|flicted with) it was found full as efficacious as the gum <HI>Kino.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hawk&s;worth,</HI> iii. p. 569, has favored us with the &s;ecret,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">HIBISCUS BILIACEUS.</NOTE> that the <HI>Hibi&s;cus Biliaceus</HI> grows here. It is the <HI>Mohoe,</HI> or bark tree of the <HI>We&s;t Indies; Sloane, Jam.</HI> i. p. 215. tab. 134. fig. 4;
<PB N="136" REF="143">and the <HI>Novella</HI> and <HI>Daun Baru</HI> of <HI>Amboina;</HI> &s;ee <HI>Rumph.</HI> ii. p. 218. tab. 73. This might be a tree of va&s;t &s;ervice to this country, were its u&s;es known to the poor natives. Tho&s;e of the South Sea i&s;lands make all their cordage, excellent fi&s;hing nets, and packthread, of the bark. It is al&s;o of great u&s;e in cloathing, and may be divided into pieces of any thickne&s;s. Specimens, brought over as curio&s;ities, &s;hew the fibrous texture &s;o fine, as to look like an elegant lace.

<P>MR. <HI>Hawk&s;worth</HI> al&s;o tells us, that the only &s;ort of fruit here is one re&s;embling a cherry, but of a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;te; it is of the kind called by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies, Pyn Appel Boomen.</HI> A wild plantane, very &s;mall, full of &s;tones, and well ta&s;ted, perhaps the <HI>Mu&s;a troglodytarum</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;&s;angbatu</HI> of <HI>Rumph. Amboin.</HI> v. p. 132, and the <HI>Mu&s;a granulo&s;a</HI> of <HI>G. For&s;ter, Pl. E&s;c.</HI> p. 31, may be added.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Hawk&s;worth</HI> be&s;ides informs us, that there was a fruit they called, from the color, a plum, &s;mall, and &s;haped like a flatted chee&s;e; and a third like a purple apple. Let me add the fruit of the <HI>Anacardium Orientale, Rumph. Amboin.</HI> i. 177. tab. 69, the tree of which, &s;ay the voyagers, was never &s;een by the <HI>European</HI> botani&s;t. And this is the &s;um of the knowledge of botany imparted to us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Arum Coloca&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Cocco Root</HI> of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> is found here; (&s;ee <HI>Hawk&s;worth,</HI> iii. 564. 590.) <HI>Rumphius</HI> has en|graven it in vol. v. p. 313. tab. 109. It is an eatable root in the <HI>Antilles,</HI> but does not appear in u&s;e in this country. It is al&s;o found in <HI>Egypt</HI> and the <HI>Moluccas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="144">SOME &s;orts of <HI>Palm Trees</HI> grow here; the <HI>Cabbage, Areca Oleracea?</HI> perhaps the <HI>Areca Sapida,</HI> and the <HI>Umbrella Palm,</HI> or <HI>Corypha Umbraculifera.</HI></P>
<P>A POOR kind of <HI>Fig,</HI> probably the <HI>Ficus Granatum</HI> of <HI>George For&s;ter, Pl. E&s;c.</HI> 36; and <HI>Sydney Parkin&s;on</HI> &s;peaks, (p. 144.) of a <HI>Cycas Circinalis,</HI> or Sago Tree, and a <HI>Glycine Ro&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Cabbage Tree,</HI> or <HI>Areca Sapida,</HI> ju&s;t mentioned (which may be cut through with a &s;ingle &s;troke of the axe) is the only tree of any u&s;e in building. Mi&s;erable con&s;ideration! The very large&s;t trees, lofty and &s;pacious as they appear, are, when &s;awed, &s;o brittle that they fall to pieces. There are, &s;ays Mr. <HI>White,</HI> (p. 179.) only three kinds of timber trees, none of which will float on water. In a word, there &s;eems to be none that can be applied to any purpo&s;e but for fuel.</P>
<P>THE attention that <HI>Dampier</HI> &s;hewed to almo&s;t every thing which came in his way,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLANTS OBSERVED BY DAMPIER.</NOTE> is evident by his bringing home from <HI>New Holland</HI> &s;everal &s;pecimens of plants. He communicated tho&s;e to &s;ome friend who certainly had much botanical know|ledge, and who de&s;cribed and drew, or cau&s;ed them to be drawn for him. The de&s;criptions and figures are in the third volume of his voyage, p. 109, &amp;c.

<P>ANOTHER river was di&s;covered,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NEPEAN RIVER.</NOTE> which Mr. <HI>Phillip</HI> named the <HI>Nepean,</HI> from three to four hundred feet broad, which al&s;o over|flows its banks in hard rains, to the &s;ame height as the former, into which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to fall.

A cataract at the foot of <HI>Richmond</HI> hill prevented the party from proceeding any further in boats. That hill is the termination of a chain of mountains, which runs northward, and probably joins tho&s;e that range nearly parallel to the coa&s;t from fifty to &s;ixty miles inland. The difficulty of reaching the&s;e hills is very great; for after the fir&s;t day's journey, is &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of ravines, many with &s;ides inacce&s;&s;ible, that our people could not proceed above fifteen miles in five days.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE BEDFORD AND CAPE FLATTERY.</NOTE> off them is a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;les, and mo&s;t numerous reefs. Let me here acquaint the reader of the very perilous &s;ituation of our illu&s;trious &s;eaman, during his three months navigation. He &s;ailed all that time in a channel bounded by the land on one &s;ide, and to the &s;eaward by a reef of rocks, or coral banks, not le&s;s tremendous, extending the length of three hundred and &s;ixty leagues. Within this reef he was obliged to anchor at night, with the thunder of the &s;urge foam|ing over it; expecting inevitable de&s;truction from the breaking of the cables, or from the driving of the &s;hip, which &s;he often did to a certain degree. The man at the chains was perpetu|ally heaving out the lead, without omitting it a moment; and under &s;uch circum&s;tances did our navigator e&s;cape. It was na|tural for him to wi&s;h to enjoy the open &s;ea; &s;oon after he left <HI>Endeavour</HI> river, by a&s;cending a lofty i&s;le, he &s;aw the opening in the reef in Lat. 14&deg; 8&prime;, which with con&s;ummate abilities and courage he attempted, and with &s;ucce&s;s. The in&s;tant he got beyond the breakers, he met with a rolling &s;ea, and no ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line; a certainty he had obtained his wi&s;h. The i&s;land from which he had made his ob&s;ervation, was one of the three called the i&s;lands of <HI>Direction,</HI> that &s;trangers in future might find the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152">NEW dangers now awaited him; a va&s;t &s;ea came rolling from the ea&s;t, and brought him nearer and nearer the perils he &s;ought to &s;hun. The &s;ame billow which had wa&s;hed the &s;ide of the &s;hip, broke to a tremendous height upon the adjacent rocks, leaving beneath an unfathomable watery valley, no broader than the ba&s;e of that &s;ingle wave. Two light breezes &s;aved them from the jaws of death. After the mo&s;t arduous ef|forts, they got through another favorable opening in the reef, through which the &s;hip was carried by a current of amazing rapidity. They now exulted in recovering that very &s;ituation they had &s;o long labored to extricate them&s;elves from. The opening was not more than a quarter of a mile wide; yet the force of the torrent carried the &s;hip exactly in the mid-way. Here it was impo&s;&s;ible not to be grateful to Heaven. Captain <HI>Cook</HI> called this &s;alutary gap <HI>Providential Inlet,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROVIDENTIAL INLET.</NOTE> and this proof of piety remains both in the book, and in the chart. The impiety of expunging it would have been too glaring.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">CORAL REEFS.</NOTE> they ri&s;e like a wall almo&s;t perpendicularly out of the unfathom|able deep, and at low water are dry in many places; here the enormous waves of the va&s;t &s;outhern ocean, meeting with &s;o abrupt a re&s;i&s;tance, break with inconceivable violence, in a &s;urf which no rocks or &s;torms in the northern hemi&s;phere can pro|duce.</P>

<P>THE long celebrated <HI>Manucodialae,</HI>

The learned <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> with his u&s;ual depth of judgment, hath collected every thing relating to that ideal bird,
<PB N="149" REF="156">in his <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>German</HI> tran&s;lation of the <HI>Indian Zoology,</HI> and effectually di&s;proved that the invention originated from any one of this <HI>genus.</HI> I refer the reader to his di&s;&s;eration, and barely mention, that the antient de&s;cribers of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> give it the form and &s;ize of an eagle, with an exqui&s;ite richne&s;s of coloring; they &s;ay that it lived Dclx years, and at the completion of that period, formed its ne&s;t with the twigs of the mo&s;t odoriferous trees, and died upon them. A young one &s;prung from its re|mains, and conveyed them to <HI>Panchaia,</HI> the city of the &s;un, per|formed the funeral rites, and placed them on the altar. <HI>Pliny,</HI> from whom this relation was taken, adds, that it was reported one had been brought to <HI>Rome,</HI> but, with his u&s;ual good &s;en&s;e, &s;tamps on it the charge of fiction.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the remotene&s;s of the native country of this whole genus, I cannot ab&s;olutely affirm the impo&s;&s;ibility of the antients being acquainted with &s;ome of the &s;pecies.

The quantity of &s;pices &s;eized by the&s;e barbarians will &s;erve to give an idea of the extent of our commerce: they found in our magazines twenty-three thou&s;and pounds of mace, and a hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds of nutmegs.

<P>WHEN the <HI>Dutch</HI> fir&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands, they met with &s;ome difficulties.

<P>THE white inhabitants, or rather <HI>Creoles,</HI> and chiefly the out|ca&s;ts of the world, or refugees of the mo&s;t abandoned princi|ples, often &s;ent here by their relations, &s;o that <HI>Banda</HI> it&s;elf is called the hou&s;e of correction. The&s;e are the coloni&s;ts who re|peopled the i&s;land, and who get &s;laves from the neighboring places to cultivate the land.

A fooli&s;h que&s;|tion a&s;ked by an <HI>Indian</HI> &s;oldier, as to the &s;trength of the place,

Our countrymen, and the eleven foreign &s;oldiers underwent the &s;ame horrid torments, which were continued at intervals during eight days. The means are too dreadful for the humane pen to recite, or the humane ear to bear. The con&s;tancy of the poor &s;ufferers was often overcome; they made &s;uch an&s;wers as they thought would &s;oone&s;t free them from the rack, and which they recanted as &s;oon as the torture cea&s;ed.

<P><Q>THE &s;ago or libby tree, has, like the cocoa-nut tree, no di&s;|tinct bark that peels off, and may be defined a long tube of hard wood, about two inches thick, containing a pulp or pith, mixed with many longitudinal fibres. The tree being felled, it is cut into lengths of about five or &s;ix feet; a part of the hard wood is then &s;liced off, and the workman coming to the pith, cuts acro&s;s (generally with an adze made of hard wood called a neebong) the longitudinal fibres, and the pith to|gether, leaving a part at each end uncut, &s;o that, when it is excavated, there remains a trough, into which the pulp is again put, mixed with water, and beat with a piece of wood; then the fibres, &s;eparated from the pulp, float at top, and the flour &s;ub&s;ides. After being cleared in this manner by &s;everal waters, the pulp is put into cylindrical ba&s;kets, made of the leaves of the tree; and if it is to be kept &s;ome time, tho&s;e ba&s;kets are generally &s;unk in fre&s;h water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ONE tree will produce from two to four hundred weight of flour; no wonder then if agriculture be neglected, in a country, where the labour of five men, in felling &s;ago trees, beating the flour, and in&s;tantly baking the bread, will main|tain a hundred. I have often found large &s;pecies of the &s;ago tree on the &s;ea-&s;hore, drifts from other countries. The &s;ago, thus &s;teeped in the &s;alt water, had always a four di&s;agreeable &s;mell; and in this &s;tate, I dare &s;ay the wild hogs would not ta&s;te it. The leaf of the &s;ago tree makes the be&s;t covering for hou&s;es of all the palm kind; it will la&s;t &s;even years.
<PB N="196" REF="203">Coverings of the <HI>Nipa</HI> or common <HI>Attop,</HI> &s;uch as they u&s;e on the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> will not la&s;t half the time. When &s;ago trees are cut down, fre&s;h ones &s;prout up from the roots; the wild hogs frequent the places where &s;ago trees have lately been cut down, and the flour or pith has been taken out; they there fea&s;t and fatten on the remains.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WE &s;eldom or never &s;ee &s;ago in <HI>Europe</HI> but in a granulated &s;tate.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">SAGO OVEN.</NOTE> it is generally nine inches &s;quare, and about four deep; it is divided into two equal parts by a partition parallel to its &s;ides; each of tho&s;e parts is &s;ubdivided into eight or nine, about an inch broad (tab. 27.); &s;o the whole contains two rows of cells, about eight or nine in a row. The &s;ago bread, fre&s;h from the oven, eats ju&s;t like hot rolls. Bread thus baked will keep, I am told, &s;everal years; I have kept it twelve months, nor did vermin de&s;troy it in that time.</Q></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">PORT MONTAGU.</NOTE> The country was mountanous, wooded, full of rich vallies and plea&s;ant &s;treams of fre&s;h water.

<P>BEYOND the&s;e was a group of &s;mall i&s;les Mr. <HI>Carteret</HI> named the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> in Lat. 2&deg; 18&prime; &s;outh, Long. 146&deg; 44&prime; ea&s;t. By the views of them they appear le&s;s elevated than <HI>Hanover</HI> i&s;le, and we may collect, from the multitudes of canoes that &s;allied out to attack our commander, that they mu&s;t be very populous; they were manned with people nearly black, with woolly heads. The natives were very ho&s;tile,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> and flung with great force lances headed with flint; they chewed betel, went quite naked, but their bodies were ornamented with &s;hells, their faces &s;treaked with white, and their heads as finely powdered with white powder as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beau ready for a <HI>Bal par&egrave;.</HI> One of their canoes, apparently the lea&s;t, was taken, yet it mea|&s;ured full fifty feet in length. In it were &s;pecimens of their arts, &s;uch as earthen pots, in which they dre&s;&s;ed their victuals, and a quantity of matting which &s;erved for &s;ails and awnings; there were be&s;ides cocoa nuts, and other fruits unknown to our people.</P>
<P>SOME of the canoes of <HI>New Ireland</HI> were ninety feet long,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CANOES.</NOTE> formed out of a &s;ingle tree; a proof of the vigorous growth of timber in this country; they were manned by three and thirty men, black and woolly headed, but they had not the thick lip or flat no&s;e; in ornaments and powdering they re&s;embled the for|mer; &s;ome had cock's feathers in their heads, a proof that they did not want poultry. They had lances by way of arms, and cord|age and fi&s;hing nets very &s;kilfully manufactured; all this coun|try
<PB N="228" REF="235">is probably well inhabited, and very fertile in trees and fruits; the &s;ea abounding in turtle and fi&s;h. The very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> and his crew, is the &s;ad but true apo|logy for our wanting, from his able pen, a fuller account of this intere&s;ting i&s;land.</P>
<P>ON <HI>July</HI> 5th 1768, M. <HI>Bougainville</HI> anchored in the &s;ame bay as Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> did, and named it <HI>Port Pra&s;lin.</HI> He ob&s;erved here the pepper plant, and found wild hogs, numbers of birds, and among others the great crowned pigeon; variety of &s;nakes, &s;corpions, and the &s;ingular in&s;ect the walking leaf.</P>
<P>AMONG the &s;erpents was the &s;ea &s;nake, of that &s;pecies which, at p. 131, is &s;u&s;pected to have been poi&s;onous; this was verified here. A &s;ailor was bitten as he was hawling the <HI>Seine,</HI> he was very &s;oon affected with violent pains all over his body; his &s;ide (the part on which he received the wound) became livid, and &s;welled greatly, the blood taken from him appeared di&s;&s;olved: he &s;uffered much for five or &s;ix hours; at length, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Venice</HI> treacle, or <HI>Theriaca Andromachi,</HI> with <HI>flower de luce</HI> water, he fell into a violent per&s;piration, and was quite cured

<P><HI>Dampier</HI> coa&s;ted the whole northern &s;ide. Captain <HI>Carteret,</HI> in his approach to the ea&s;tern end, fell in with a group of little i&s;les, to which he gave the name of the <HI>nine i&s;les.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed between two larger, the more &s;outhern he called Lord <HI>An&s;on</HI>'s; the more northern, Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI>'s, in Lat. 4&deg; 50&prime; &s;outh, was flat, verdant, and appeared well inhabited.

<PB N="229" REF="236">It is nine or ten leagues round, ri&s;es into high hummocks full of lofty trees, with plantations and groves near the &s;hores, and &s;eemingly very populous. We now fall in with <HI>Dampier,</HI> with cape St. <HI>Mary's,</HI> in Lat. 5&deg; 2&prime; &s;outh. The country was mounta|nous, high, and wooded, with many points of land running into the &s;ea, forming between them as many fine bays. Here a man of large &s;ize approached the &s;hip, and &s;poke a language different from tho&s;e <HI>Dampier</HI> had before &s;een. Proceeding north-we&s;t|ward, the whole extent of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> or the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to St. <HI>George</HI>'s channel (afterwards traced by Captain <HI>Carteret</HI>) ap|pears before us. At &s;ome di&s;tance from it is a chain of i&s;les, of which St. <HI>John</HI>'s may be deemed one. They had been all named by the <HI>Dutch. Antony Cave</HI>'s is lofty.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">GERARD DENNIS's.</NOTE> <HI>Gerard Dennis</HI>'s is the next, fourteen or fifteen leagues in circumference; high, wooded, and mountanous, thick &s;et with plantations, and full of cocoa trees. The &s;hape was irregular, full of points, forming &s;andy bays; the ground cleared for plantations, and the &s;oil of a browni&s;h red color. The next i&s;land, named <HI>Wi&s;hart</HI>'s,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">WISHART'S.</NOTE> re&s;embled the preceding. <HI>Dampier</HI> al&s;o di&s;covered two other i&s;lands &s;ome|what farther to the we&s;t: One, ten leagues long, he named <HI>Ma|thias;</HI> like many others, mountanous and woody, mixed with <HI>Savannas,</HI> and cleared land; and near that a low and plain i&s;land, cloathed with tall and large trees, as clo&s;e to each other as they could &s;tand. This he called the <HI>&s;qually,</HI> from the violent gales he met with off the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>IN re&s;pect to the north &s;hore of <HI>New Ireland,</HI> I find that our navigator attempted to touch at only one place, which he named <HI>Slinger</HI>'s bay. This country &s;eems prodigiou&s;ly populous;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">SLINGER'S BAY.</NOTE> his
<PB N="230" REF="237">&s;hip was &s;urrounded with prows filled with men, who a&s;&s;aulted him with &s;tones flung out of engines; and the &s;hores were lined with the natives from end to end.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">NATIVES.</NOTE> All the inhabitants of this, and the adjacent i&s;les, were a warlike race, ho&s;tile to &s;trangers, and very &s;u&s;picious. They were tall, even above the &s;ize of the common race of men, &s;trong, and well made, had curled &s;hort hair, often &s;haved in different forms, and &s;tained with white, red, and yellow; their heads were round faces broad; they had great bottle no&s;es, and &s;ub&s;tances &s;tuck through the gri&s;tle, pa&s;&s;ing from cheek to cheek. Their weapons were lances, &s;words, &s;lings, and bows and arrows; their &s;peech clear and di&s;|tinct. All the&s;e are the &s;ame kind of people, from the remote&s;t of the <HI>Papuan</HI> i&s;les to this i&s;land; varying a little in the dre&s;&s;ing of their hair, and other trifling matters.</P>
<P>THEIR prows were very neatly built,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PROWS.</NOTE> with out-riggers on one &s;ide; the head and &s;tern elevated, and mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly carved with figures of fi&s;h, fowl, and on one was a man's head, done mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ingly well, con&s;idering the rude in|&s;truments of &s;tone they had to work with; for they &s;eemed ignorant of the u&s;es of iron; their paddles were very neat; and they made their way with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s through the water.</P>
<P>A VERY legendary tale is told, in <HI>L'Hi&s;toire de Navigations aux Terres Au&s;trales</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 434.</NOTE>, re&s;pecting the origin of the <HI>Negro</HI> race in the&s;e <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> i&s;les, which is fir&s;t met with in &s;ome of the <HI>Manillas,</HI> continued through the <HI>Papuan</HI> i&s;les and <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and even through <HI>New Holland.</HI> I have mentioned them before in my

<P>I NOW return from cape <HI>Biron,</HI> or <HI>Soloma&s;war,</HI> taking a cour&s;e due &s;outh, along the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of the i&s;les of <HI>New Britain.</HI> Near the extreme we&s;tern part of the farthe&s;t is an headland, called by <HI>Dampier, Cape Glouce&s;ter.</HI> At a &s;mall di&s;tance to the we&s;t is a little i&s;land, which at the time our navigator pa&s;&s;ed it, was a raging volcano. It flung up columns of flame twenty or thirty yards high, attended with a noi&s;e like thunder, followed by an overflowing of red-hot lava, which ran down the &s;ides of the mountain till it reached the &s;ea. This continued two days and nights, or as long as this tremendous phaeno|menon continued in &s;ight.</P>
<P>I NOW repa&s;s <HI>Dampier</HI>'s &s;treights ea&s;tward, and turn to the &s;outh. In Mr. <HI>Arrow&s;mith</HI>'s excellent map of the world, <HI>New Guinea</HI> is continued by dotted lines, farther to the ea&s;t; and on the &s;outh &s;ide, near the extremity of that line, the uncertainty is taken away by a tract of land di&s;covered by M. <HI>de Bougainville</HI> in 1768, which he named <HI>La Loui&s;iade,</HI> and the extreme ea&s;tern point <HI>Le Cap de la Deliverance,</HI> in memory of his narrow e&s;cape from a violent tempe&s;t. The great bay which he calls <HI>Le Golfe de la Loui&s;iade</HI> is ju&s;t to the &s;outh of the cape. Such a confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by the fears and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the great <HI>French</HI> navigator, is &s;o apparent in this part of his voyage, that nothing more can be collected re&s;pecting this portion of <HI>New Guinea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">WE mu&s;t therefore &s;teer along another dotted line till we arrive at <HI>Prince of Wales</HI>'s i&s;lands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLES.</NOTE> Lat. 10&deg; 33&prime; &s;outh, Long. 142&deg; ea&s;t. The large&s;t is long and narrow, and lies parallel with the coa&s;t. This part of the &s;ea between <HI>New Guinea</HI> and <HI>New Hol|land</HI> is called <HI>Torres</HI>'s &s;treights,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">TORRES'S STREIGHTS.</NOTE> for having been pa&s;&s;ed in 1606 by <HI>Don Baes de Torres,</HI> admiral under <HI>Fernandez Quiros;</HI> corre|&s;pondent to them, beyond another &s;et of i&s;lands, named al&s;o the <HI>Prince of Wales</HI>'s, is the <HI>Endeavour</HI> &s;treight, pa&s;&s;ed, as I have before mentioned, by our boa&s;ted <HI>Cook.</HI></P>
<P>IN proceeding along the coa&s;ts, I find names of places, but nothing more. Captain <HI>Cook,</HI> on his quitting the coa&s;t of <HI>New Holland,</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the intervening water, and touched in Lat. 6&deg; 15&prime; at a place on this &s;ide of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> to which he has neither left a name, nor yet even the mark of landing in his chart. We are told that it lay &s;ixty-five leagues to the north-ea&s;t of <HI>Waelche</HI> cape. The country was low, but covered with &s;uch a luxuriancy of wood and herbage as &s;carcely can be conceived; and among them &s;uch numbers of aromatic trees, as perfumed the air even at a di&s;tance from &s;hore. The natives were ho&s;tile, went quite naked, and had much the appearance of the <HI>New Hollanders.</HI> They &s;houted defiance, and from a &s;hort &s;tick or hollow cane they &s;wung in their hands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">FIRE-ARMS.</NOTE> was emitted fla&s;hes of fire, exactly like the effect of gunpowder; the&s;e explo&s;ions were innocent, nor could our navigators ever learn the cau&s;e. After each explo|&s;ion, which was done by a &s;ingle man, his companions flung their bearded darts. All that we learn farther of this country is, that it produced &s;ine cocoa-nuts, plantanes, and bread fruit.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="240">CAPE <HI>Waelche</HI> or <HI>Wal&s;h,</HI> the mo&s;t we&s;tern point of this coa&s;t,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">CAPE WAELCHE.</NOTE> lies in Lat. 8&deg; 32&prime; &s;outh, Long. 137&deg; ea&s;t. From hence the land runs &s;trait, inclining to the north-ea&s;t, when it takes another turn towards the north-we&s;t. The &s;pace between the trendings is occupied by the tract, marked in Mr. <HI>Arrow&s;mith</HI>'s map as pervious by two &s;treights. The <HI>Arrou</HI> i&s;les lie tran&s;|ver&s;e, at &s;ome di&s;tance from this part of <HI>New Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER to the north-we&s;t, nearly parallel to the end of <HI>Ceram,</HI> is <HI>Fre&s;hwater</HI> bay, in Lat. 1&deg; 33&prime; &s;outh. This was vi&s;ited by <HI>Dampier</HI> in 1699. The country was wooded and mounta|nous, like the other parts of <HI>New Guinea,</HI> and the trees of great &s;ize; here his people killed one of tho&s;e magnificent pigeons called the <HI>crowned.</HI> The bay received its name from the plenty of fre&s;h water; and another, a little farther north, was called <HI>Mackerel</HI> bay, from the great quantity of that fi&s;h,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">MACKEREL BAY.</NOTE> or one re&s;em|bling it, which was taken there.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to this bay, in Lat. 2&deg; 43&prime; &s;outh, is <HI>Pulo Sabuda,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PULO SABUDA.</NOTE> a lofty i&s;land, about three leagues long and two broad, not far from the coa&s;t of <HI>New Guinea;</HI> it is in general rocky, but &s;o mixed with rich yellow and black &s;oil, as to be productive of many of the tropical fruits and trees. The &s;ago tree and the <HI>Jacca</HI> are found there. The natives gave <HI>Dampier</HI> two or three nutmegs, &s;eemingly fre&s;h gathered; but he could not tell whe|ther they were the produce of the i&s;le or of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> The inhabitants do not &s;eem to be aboriginal. They are tawny, have long black hair, and differ little from the <HI>Mindanayans,</HI> and the people of the other ea&s;tern i&s;les; the women wear a callico co|vering;
<PB N="234" REF="241">the men go almo&s;t naked, and are very &s;kilful in &s;triking fi&s;h; they have great boats in which they often vi&s;it <HI>New Guinea,</HI> where they procure &s;laves, beautiful parrots, &amp;c. which they carry to <HI>Goram,</HI> and exchange for callicoes. They keep many of the poor <HI>Papuans</HI> for their own u&s;e to do the laborious work. This i&s;land has the &s;ame birds as the main land, and bats of an enormous &s;ize.</P>
<P>I CANNOT quit this part of the coa&s;t without mentioning a &s;ingular communication made to Captain <HI>Forre&s;t</HI> (p. 149.) by the natives of <HI>E&s;&s;-be</HI> in the i&s;land of <HI>Mixoal,</HI> that on the coa&s;t of <HI>New Guinca,</HI> not far from a gulph about a day's &s;ail from <HI>Wanim</HI> or <HI>Onin,</HI> a place about twenty leagues from the north|ea&s;t of the i&s;le of <HI>Goram,</HI> was a &s;et of people who wore large turbans. He imagines them to have been the po&s;terity of a colony of <HI>Arabs.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">ARABS.</NOTE> If this is true, their di&s;covery will be ju&s;t as important to the world as that of the race of <HI>Owen Gwynedd,</HI> long lo&s;t to the <HI>Britons,</HI> till it has been lately credited that they &s;till exi&s;t in <HI>America,</HI> under the title of <HI>Padoucas</HI> or <HI>Wel&s;h In|dians.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the we&s;tern &s;ide of <HI>New Guinea</HI> (probably all parts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">PLENTY OF NUTMEGS.</NOTE> if properly examined) abound with nutmeg trees, is very certain. A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;hip, which was forced by a &s;torm from its anchor|age at <HI>Timor,</HI> was driven to this coa&s;t, and there anchored in order to repair the damage &s;he had received. The captain, during the interval, procured a &s;ufficient loading of nutmegs, with which he &s;ailed directly to <HI>Macao,</HI> and &s;old them, without ever return|ing to his former place of de&s;tination.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242">FROM <HI>Mackerel</HI> bay, the coa&s;t trends to the north-we&s;t as far as the &s;treights of <HI>Galowa</HI> and <HI>Salwatty</HI> i&s;land.

<Q>This &s;pecies grows in the warmer parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and is much u&s;ed for walking &s;ticks and fi&s;hing rods. This is a fragile &s;taff, and the only cane in u&s;e that has that property. Upon an accidental brui&s;e it will break in &s;hivers. It is the Kaneh of the Hebrews; and from its brittle quality we &s;ee the propriety of Rab&s;hakah's allu&s;ion, 2 Kings, xviii. 21. <Q>Now behold thou tru&s;te&s;t upon the &s;taff of this brui&s;ed reed (kaneh), even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it; &s;o is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that tru&s;t on him.</Q> The Hebrew word having been introduced not only into the Greek and Latin, but mo&s;t of the modern languages of Europe. The Spaniards call it Cannas, and the Italians Canna. It gave the name of Cane to all the &s;ticks which re&s;embled it, when they were fir&s;t imported by the Dutch, &amp;c. from the Ea&s;t Indies.</Q></ITEM>
