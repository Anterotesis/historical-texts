<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO THOMAS HARRIS, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR treatment to me has been &s;o &s;ingularly kind and liberal, that it would be inflicting the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ment on my pride, to oblige me to con|ceal it from the world. I had been taught to believe, that without a patron among&s;t the great, or an e&s;tabli&s;hed li|terary &s;ame, it was next to an impo&s;&s;i|bility to get a piece introduced on the &s;tage: but you, Sir, have proved to me, that this complaint is groundle&s;s: tho' unknown and unprotected, your beha|viour to me has been &s;uch as the mo&s;t delicate mind could &s;ugge&s;t, or the mo&s;t powerful influence have procured me. If then you countenance thus warmly &s;o humble a tribute as mine at the &s;hrine of the mu&s;es, how much &s;uperior at|tention mu&s;t you be&s;tow on the more elevated and &s;ublime efforts of the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
mind, when Thalia comes arrayed by the hand of Genius with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s graces, or her weeping &s;i&s;ter, in native fables with all the conflicting pa&s;&s;ions in her train. The encouragement you give to every dawn of talents, whil&s;t it wins you the re&s;pect and e&s;teem of the pub|lic, mu&s;t prove of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice to the cau&s;e of letters. Patronage and &s;ucce&s;s often lend a degree of force and brilliancy to moderate abilities; but ripen a truly fine genius into immedi|ate perfection. I have the honour to remain,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PUBLIC ta&s;te has run &s;o much of late on the French <HI>petite comedie</HI> of two <HI>acts,</HI> that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething in ju&s;tification of <HI>farce,</HI> to prevent its being tried by the too rigid rules of critici&s;m. In this refined age, <HI>low</HI> and <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> are terms of re|proach heard to echo from the benches of the upper gallery; &s;o that whoever attempts to rai&s;e a laugh by downright <HI>farce,</HI> mu&s;t ex|pect critics in all quarters of the hou&s;e ready to damn him for attempting to put them in good humour.</P>
<P><HI>Farce</HI> has ever been con&s;idered &s;o e&s;&s;entially different from <HI>comedy,</HI> that any incident in the latter bordering upon the <HI>extravagant,</HI> has been termed <HI>farcical</HI> or <HI>outr&eacute;</HI> by way of di&s;|crimination. This &s;pecies of entertainment is certainly more a <HI>caricature</HI> than a <HI>faithful picture of nature</HI>&mdash;the outline is pre&s;erved but extended, and every tint of the colouring con&s;iderably heightened. For in&s;tance&mdash;can any thing be more improbable and extrava|gant, than the plot and incidents of the Mock Doctor? yet this has been the production of two of the fir&s;t comic geniu&s;&s;es this or any other country ever produced. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Moliere and Fielding were ig|norant of the rules of the drama; neverthele&s;s, in their be&s;t farces they totally lo&s;t fight of them, appearing to have nothing in view but whim&s;ical characters and laughable &s;ituations.
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
The humour and characters of <HI>the Inva&s;ion</HI> in &s;ome places have been cen&s;ured as low, but &s;urely the &s;ame charge holds good again&s;t the the mo&s;t celebrated writers. Smollett, Field|ing, Gay, Cervantes, all de&s;cended to the hum|ble walk of life in &s;earch of Humour, and never rejected her for the homeline&s;s of her garb. It is true, that if painting low life be a fault, tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed wits were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of beauties &s;ufficient to eclip&s;e little &s;pots in their reputa|tion. The writer of <HI>the Inva&s;ion</HI> feels but too &s;en&s;ibly the humiliating di&s;tance he is thrown from them, and, that whatever his faults are, he has nothing to depend upon for hiding them except the candour of his readers. The following little entertainment he meant merely as a <HI>farce,</HI> and as &s;uch <HI>only</HI> he hopes it will be con&s;idered and judged of.</P>
<P>He cannot conclude without returning his warme&s;t acknowledgments to Mr. Garrick for a&s;&s;i&s;tances in the Inva&s;ion, which have contributed more than the merit of the author to its &s;ucce&s;s with the public.</P>
<P>The performers in general acquitted them|&s;elves with the greate&s;t &s;pirit and propriety; particularly Mr. Lee Lewes, who, by his &s;peaking the prologue and his acting Came|leon, proved that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e various and ver&s;atile powers which con&s;titute the truly capital comedian.</P>

<L>Where play-bills &s;pread, &s;eem like a centinel,</L>

<L>"What the&s;e folks mean by their Inva&s;ion &s;hew:</L>

<P>I have not &s;een Emily this month: as he knows &s;he has a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds in|dependent of him, he keeps her a clo&s;e pri&s;oner; and to &s;uch an exce&s;s does this military mania hur|ry him, that, I believe in my con&s;cience he would prefer a &s;erjeant of invalids, or a Chel&s;ea pen&s;ioner, to your di&s;carded friend, for a &s;on-in-law.</P>

ridicule, as a lawyer, I mu&s;t incur, by going into the army. He continued inflexible; a&s;&s;erted Old England was in danger daily of an inva&s;ion, and that every man who had a regard for her laws and con&s;titution, &s;hould now fight for them.</P>

<P>Then, Sir, it &s;eems he is in great dread of an inva&s;ion.</P>

<P>Why, faith, no&mdash;very few know any thing about him. Brighthelm&s;tone, during the &s;ea|&s;on, is too much engaged with &s;candal and gallantry&mdash;then his hou&s;e &s;tanding &s;o far out of the town&mdash;</P>

<P>'Sdeath! if, in&s;tead of bani&s;hing me for faults he was guilty of him&s;elf at my age, he had clapped a &s;word into my hand, and bade me fight for my country, he'd have acted like an Engli&s;hman and a good father: but an old fellow of &s;ixty, trou|bled three or four times a year with the gout, to think of going into the army!&mdash;he may as well think of a wife.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard that your old aunt, Lady Catherine Rouge, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;ummer, for the fir&s;t time, at his hou&s;e. She, Sir, is my mo&s;t formidable enemy. Would you believe it, Charles? The old lady actually made love to me; and becau&s;e I did not return her overtures with all the warmth &s;he expected, like a true woman, &s;he mo&s;t cordially hates me.</P>

<P>She does?&mdash;More &s;hame for you, Sir, to put it in her power.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to your grandmother her&s;elf, provided that was the only method you had left to obtain the real mi&s;tre&s;s of your heart. Now, had I been in your &s;ituation, and &s;he had been as withered as a mummy, without a tooth in her head, or a hair of any colour to boa&s;t of, I'd have been at her feet from morning till night, &s;wore that &s;he had a Cupid in every wrinkle, that I loved her more than Antony did Cleopatra, and that if the Godde&s;s of Di&s;cord threw another golden apple upon earth, to be given to the faire&s;t, and appointed me judge, her Lady&s;hip, without having a tooth to eat it, &s;hould have had the pippin before to-morrow morning.</P>

<P>It is no matter what I am, Sir, I wi&s;h to &s;erve my ma&s;ter, and &s;erve you too, Sir; and I think I can do it, provided my ma&s;ter is not altogether &s;o &s;queami&s;h as his friend.</P>

<P>What are you driving at, Cameleon?</P>

<P>I only hope, Sir, that you are not &s;o refined in your notions of beauty as Mr. Beaufort; and that, provided it is your intere&s;t, you can mi&s;take the &s;now upon an old &s;aple&s;s trunk, for blo&s;&s;oms and green leaves, and &s;wear you feel the heat of the Dog-days in the month of December. But to wave metaphor, I hope, Sir, you will think that Lady Catherine has &s;till &s;ome charms left.</P>

<P>Why, you ra&s;cal, have you forgot &s;he is my aunt?</P>

<P>Not &s;ince I was eight years old, when, I re|member, &s;he has often taken me on her knee, pat|ted

my cheek, played with my ringlets, and called me her little Adonis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, you mu&s;t now return the com|pliment, you mu&s;t take her upon your knee, pat her cheeks, play with her ringlets, and call her your full-grown Venus.</P>

<P>P&s;ha! fool! this will never take. A wo|man that has lived in the &s;phere &s;he has&mdash;</P>

<P>Will believe any hand&s;ome young fellow, who tells her he is love with her. The &s;phere &s;he has lived in! 'Sdeath, Sir, do you &s;uppo&s;e women of quality live in the &s;phere of Dian, or are all born under Virgo? It might have been &s;o formerly, but the pre&s;ent race are certainly under the influ|ence of warmer planets. A woman of quality ex|pects lovers to the la&s;t moment of her life; and as the kings of France, from exce&s;s of re&s;pect, are &s;up|po&s;ed never to die, &s;o a woman of fa&s;hion, from ex|ce&s;s of gallantry, is &s;uppo&s;ed never to cea&s;e to be beautiful.

<P>But, lord Sir, a love letter is &s;uch a dif|ferent kind of letter from all other letters, that without great practice, there is no &s;uch thing as writing one, e&s;pecially to an elderly lady&mdash;for after a certain period, the ta&s;te becomes &s;o callous, it reli&s;hes nothing that is not &s;ea&s;oned very high&mdash;Have you put darts and flames enough into it?</P>
