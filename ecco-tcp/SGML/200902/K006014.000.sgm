<L>The dame and pedlar both aro&s;e,</L>

<L>She for her work of folding cloaths,</L>

<L>Ho&s;te&s;s, quoth He, before I go,</L>

But if you'll take this piece of Stuff&mdash;</L>

<LG>
<L>Thank you, &s;he &s;aid, and &s;hut the door,</L>
<L>Turn'd to her work, and thought no more.</L>
<L>And now the napkin, which was &s;pread</L>
<L>To treat her gue&s;t with good brown bread,</L>
<L>She folded up with nice&s;t care;</L>
<L>When lo! another napkin there!</L>
<L>And every folding did beget</L>
<L>Another and another yet.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13">
She folds a &s;hift&mdash;by &s;trange encrea&s;e,</L>

<L>Her Caps, her Laces, all the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Till &s;uch a quantity of Linen,</L>
<L>From &s;uch a very &s;mall beginning,</L>
<L>Flow'd in at once upon the Dame,</L>

<L>That with the drap'ry &s;he had got</L>
<L>Within her little &s;habby cot,</L>
<L>She might for all the town provide</L>
<L>And break both York-&s;treet and Cheap&s;ide.</L>

<L>It happen'd that th' attorney's wife,</L>
<L>Who, to be &s;ure, took much upon her,</L>
<L>As being one in higher Life,</L>
<L>Who did the Pari&s;h mighty honour,</L>

<L>Would take a job of charing work,</L>

<L>She could not come, not &s;he indeed!</L>
<L>She thank'd her much, but had no need.</L>

<L>Good news will fly as well as bad,</L>
<L>So out this wond'rous &s;tory came,</L>

<L>And drop her curt&s;ie at the door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now all was racket, noi&s;e and pother,</L>

<L>Upon my word, it &s;hocks me much,</L>
