<HEAD>ESSAY XXI. INSTITUTES of MOSES.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND IF A MAN CAUSE A BLEMISH IN HIS NEIGHBOUR; AS HE HATH DONE, SO SHALL IT BE DONE UNTO HIM.</Q>
<P>THE laws of Mo&s;es are, in part, very properly aboli&s;hed, be|ing, indeed, only in&s;tituted for local occa&s;ions, and adapted to the temper of the times. But there are others which, with little or no alteration, are, and de&s;erve to be, of eternal force. In the two ver&s;es
<PB N="2" REF="7">directly preceding this pa&s;&s;age, there is a very excellent di&s;tinction made in point of puni&s;hments and offences. <Q>He that killeth a man &s;hall &s;urely be put to death: and he that killeth a bea&s;t, &s;hall &s;ure|ly make it good.</Q> Thus the hu|man per&s;on is rendered &s;acred, and the animal, which is private pro|perty, is made &s;ecure to the pro|prietor. Methinks the following ver&s;e may be con&s;idered as one of the great and original foundations of &s;ocial pre&s;ervation: <Q>Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.</Q> It is at this very day the true recriminating prin|ciple, not, indeed, quite literally,
<PB N="3" REF="8">but eventually: and who can call the rectitude of it in que&s;tion? In reading the&s;e ancient records, how|ever, we find &s;everal crimes pe|nable, which are now, though highly attrocious, &s;carce within the letter of the law. The bla&s;|phemer, and &s;abbath-breaker, for in&s;tance, was <HI>&s;toned;</HI> and now the price of an oath is, at wor&s;t, but a &s;hilling: and the other matter, for the mo&s;t part, is no object of attention. There are many mi|nute articles in the code of Mo&s;es &s;till in being among&s;t us: thus, an hired hor&s;e, dying upon its journey, is, to this day, as it was formerly; being an hired thing,
<PB N="4" REF="9">it came for his hire. The mat|ter and cu&s;tom of <HI>gleaning</HI> was, cer|tainly, fir&s;t derived from the fol|lowing command:</P>
<Q>When thou cutte&s;t down thine harve&s;t in the field, and ha&s;t for|got a &s;heaf in the field, thou &s;halt not go again to fetch it; it &s;hall be for the &s;tranger, for the fatherle&s;s, and for the wi|dow; that the Lord thy God may ble&s;s thee in all the work of thy hands.</Q>
<P>The term of an <HI>apprenti&s;hip</HI> &s;eems to originate from the follow|ing in&s;titute: <Q>If thou buy an
<PB N="5" REF="10">Hebrew &s;ervant, &s;ix years he &s;hall &s;erve, and at the end of the &s;eventh he &s;hall go out free: and if a man fell his daughter for a maid-&s;ervant, &s;he &s;hall not <HI>go out,</HI> as the men &s;ervants do.</Q> There is, I think, no doubt, but this is the foundation of the rule of allotting the harder labour of the fields to the male, and the ea&s;ier cares of the hou&s;e to the female. The&s;e are, indeed, curious and &s;mall; but &s;urely, no man will think them <HI>unintere&s;ting</HI> remarks. Now I am upon the &s;ubject of the &s;tatutes of Mo&s;es, I cannot neglect mention of various humane and &s;ocial in&s;titutions,
<PB N="6" REF="11">&s;ome of which are very improperly abrogated.</P>
<Q>If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or a&s;s, going a&s;tray, thou &s;halt &s;urely bring it back to him again: if thou &s;ee the a&s;s of him that hateth thee, lying under his burthen, thou &s;halt &s;urely help him.</Q>
<P>It is much to be feared, the enemies of the pre&s;ent day will &s;carce forbear <HI>&s;miling</HI> at this in|junction, &s;o far from obeying it.</P>
<Q>Thou &s;halt not countenance a poor man in his cau&s;e.</Q>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">
In one &s;en&s;e, this is mo&s;t rigid|ly ob&s;erved in all the courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<Q>And if thou &s;ell ought of thy neighbour, or buy ought of thy neighbour, ye &s;hall not op|pre&s;s one another.</Q>
<P>The <HI>modern</HI> maxim of &s;triking a bargain, is, perhaps, &s;omething different from this.</P>
<Q>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then, thou &s;halt relieve him, &s;o that he may live with thee.</Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">
It is really painful to comment, and draw parallels betwixt ancient and modern times, when we are compelled to cen&s;ure the latter in &s;o many ca&s;es:&mdash;let us, therefore, clo&s;e the &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XXII. STORY of BALAAM and his Ass.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE ASS, AND SHE SAID UNTO BALAAM, WHAT HAVE I DONE UNTO THEE, THAT THOU HAST SMITTEN ME THESE THREE TIMES?</Q>
<P>IN whatever light this matter is viewed, whether as an opera|tion of the Deity (which we have no right to di&s;pute, &s;ince the &s;ame power which can command water from the rock, can as ea&s;ily in&s;pire
<PB N="10" REF="15">the animal with argument) or whether we con&s;ider it in the light merely of a moral fable, it is won|derfully beautiful and pathetic. I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate it both &s;cripturally and hi&s;torically.</P>
<P><Q>Now Balaam was riding upon his a&s;s, and his two &s;ervants were with him.</Q> In the very &s;etting out of the journey, it was a thing di&s;plea&s;ing to the Deity, and the fir&s;t hints of his di&s;plea&s;ure were very remarkably di&s;played. <Q>And the a&s;s &s;aw the angel of the Lord &s;tanding in the way, and his &s;word drawn in his hand.</Q> Upon this, the poor creature, very
<PB N="11" REF="16">naturally a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a &s;pec|table, turned a&s;ide out of the way, and went into the field; <Q>And Balaam &s;mote the a&s;s to turn her into the way.</Q> In oppo&s;iti|on however to blows, the animal awhile went on, till the &s;ame an|gelic appearance, &s;tanding in a path of the vineyards, made her fly in terror towards the wall, a|gain&s;t which &s;he unfortunately cru&s;hed the foot of her ma&s;ter: and for this &s;econd offence he &s;mote her again. But &s;till the cele&s;tial vi&s;itant re&s;olved, as it were, to ob&s;truct, or at lea&s;t to de|lay the journey, &s;tood at la&s;t in &s;o narrow a place, that there was no
<PB N="12" REF="17">po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing either to the right hand, or to the left; and when the a&s;s found her&s;elf thus be&s;et, and thus thwarted in all her endeavours&mdash;what could &s;he do? She had re&s;pect to the commands of her lord, but &s;he was unable to obey them; po&s;&s;ibly too, &s;he was more than affrighted&mdash;&s;he might be <HI>awed</HI> by the figure be|fore her&mdash;&s;he, therefore, fell down; and Balaam, con&s;idering this third tre&s;pa&s;s as a &s;till greater aggrava|tion of ob&s;tinacy, &s;mote the a&s;s with his &s;taff. Then it was that the Power, who knew the innocence of the poor thing, took pity upon her &s;ufferings, and, to put at once
<PB N="13" REF="18">an end to the hard u&s;age, her mouth was opened, that &s;he might plead her own cau&s;e with the man, and enter into a pathetic remon|&s;trance with him upon the &s;ubject of his barbarity. <Q>And &s;he &s;aid unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou ha&s;t &s;mitten me the&s;e three times?</Q> But Balaam was now too violently angry to attend even to miracles, and, without regarding the cir|cum&s;tance, as being preternatural, he replied to it merely as an ordi|nary que&s;tion, by wi&s;hing, in the vehemence of his heart, a &s;word was in his hand, that he might kill the offender upon the &s;pot. And
<PB N="14" REF="19">now &s;ucceeds an an&s;wer which might melt the harde&s;t heart, and &s;often the compa&s;&s;ionate into tears. <Q>Am not I thine a&s;s upon which thou ha&s;t ridden ever &s;ince I was thine, unto this day? Was I ever wont to do &s;o unto thee?</Q> Imagination here unavoidably ex|tends the commentary. How, Balaam, can&s;t thou thus ill entreat thy &s;ervant? Have I at any time, &s;ave now, re&s;i&s;ted thy de&s;igns, and have not thy &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;hes been to me in the nature of injunctions? Thrice ha&s;t thou lifted up thine arm in anger again&s;t me, and thrice have I borne the angui&s;h without complaining. Ah, un|gentle
<PB N="15" REF="20">ma&s;ter&mdash;coulde&s;t thou not conceive that &s;ome peculiar occa|&s;ion prevented my obedience? if haply nothing &s;truck <HI>thine</HI> eye as an ob&s;tacle, &s;urely, thou mighte&s;t have relied upon one, who&s;e fide|lity, both by day and by night, thou ha&s;t &s;o often experienced. Am I not the old &s;lave of your plea&s;ure, contented with whatever food it is convenient for you to allot me&mdash;nothing loath to per|form the labours to which I was born, and to earn the herb of the field before I ate it! To this ex|po&s;tulation, which one would think might have force enough to re|&s;train the iron hand of inhumani|ty
<PB N="16" REF="21">it&s;elf, Balaam replied, by confe&s;|&s;ing that her arguments were true: <Q>Was I ever <HI>wont</HI> to do &s;o unto thee?</Q> <HI>Nay,</HI> an&s;wered Balaam.</P>
<P>Soon after this dialogue, the angel convinced Balaam of his fault, and he then bowed his face to the earth&mdash;&s;truck, probably, with a &s;en&s;e of double impro|priety&mdash;Why ha&s;t thou &s;mitten thine a&s;s?&mdash;If a man was to be fairly a&s;ked this que&s;tion in the courts of moral equity, tho&s;e courts where Con&s;cience &s;its as judge, how would he be able to an&s;wer it? There is no need to run this fine narrative into the perplexities
<PB N="17" REF="22">of &s;ubtle and latent meaning, it is &s;ufficiently admirable as an addre&s;s to the human heart, And, in|deed, the &s;criptures are not more earne&s;t and per&s;ua&s;ive in the cau&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion, than in the cau&s;e of &s;alvation. There is &s;carce a chapter in which pity, that &s;weet emanation of Heaven, is not en|joined; and that the reader might not be fatigued with &s;amene&s;s of &s;entiment, or tired with likene&s;s of language, the &s;tyle of the &s;ubject is varied, almo&s;t a thou&s;and times: &s;ometimes the lovely quality of mercy is recommended to us, (as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) by a ten|der and attracting narrative&mdash;&s;ome|times
<PB N="18" REF="23">by a beautiful allegory, or parable; and very often by a con|ci&s;e moral &s;entence, expre&s;&s;ed in a way &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;triking, that we are led to the practice of the virtue, not only by a veneration for its intrin&s;ic charms, but by the additional graces which it re|ceives from compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Even the &s;ore&s;t <HI>cur&s;es</HI> in the &s;criptures are, for the mo&s;t part, again&s;t <HI>cruelty,</HI> and to recommend kindne&s;s: and in the <HI>beginning</HI> of the 22d chapter of Deuteronomy, i. e. from ver&s;e the fir&s;t to ver&s;e the &s;eventh, there are &s;entiments of the mo&s;t humane and affec|tionate
<PB N="19" REF="24">tendency that ever were read, conceived, in&s;pired, or prac|ti&s;ed. Let every man who has a heart, peru&s;e them&mdash;I will not add&mdash;<HI>attentively</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e, to pe|ru&s;e them <HI>negligently,</HI> where any degree of <HI>feeling</HI> is be&s;towed, is utterly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t have been the &s;en|&s;ations of Balaam when he under|&s;tood from the lip of a Divinity, that unle&s;s the a&s;s had turned in the very manner he did, the ma&s;ter would have been &s;lain, and the &s;ervant pre&s;erved alive? How ex|treme &s;hould be the caution, and how palpable the error before pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="20" REF="25">is inflicted; for &s;uch is the infirmity of man, he may thrice &s;mite his pre&s;erver for tho&s;e very actions, which, ultimately, produce the mo&s;t de&s;irable and eminent ble&s;&s;ings; and when once &s;uch a mi&s;take happens, and the indig|nity is given, where is the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient effrontery to meet the eye of his benefactor? Every &s;troke we have given re|turns invigorated upon our&s;elves, and we feel the blows &s;hamefully burning upon our cheeks.</P>

<P>AND WHEN THOU HAST SEEN IT, THOU ALSO, SHALT BE GATHERED UNTO THY PEOPLE.</P></Q>
<P>HOW few are there at this day in the world, whom &s;uch a command would not terrify? It is plainly a&s;certaining the mo&s;t awe|ful
<PB N="22" REF="27">moment of mortality: yet the excellent per&s;on to whom it was &s;poken, appears to have received it without the lea&s;t alarming emo|tion; and that, not becau&s;e he was in&s;en&s;ible, but becau&s;e he had talked with his maker as with a friend, and becau&s;e he was a&s;&s;ur|ed. Being informed of his own death, indeed, he was anxious to fill up the vacancy which he &s;hould leave, properly, and therefore for the &s;ake of po&s;terity, petitioned for a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In the&s;e times, &s;uch intelligence, even though it were communicated in a dream, would di&s;order all the felicity of the day, and the very be&s;t of us,
<PB N="23" REF="28">would dread the advances of the night, le&s;t the horrid images &s;hould again appear: but if, as in this place, the tidings were conveyed by the voice of God him&s;elf, al|though the event was not to hap|pen for fifty years, the whole &s;cheme of life (however delight|fully our imaginations had before coloured it, however bright our expectation, or &s;plendid our cir|cum&s;tances) would be in&s;tantly de&s;troyed: The radiance of the morning enwrapt &s;uddenly amid&s;t the gloom of midnight, gives us but a faint &s;imile to expre&s;s the a&s;toni&s;hment and the angui&s;h, that would, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, &s;eize
<PB N="24" REF="29">the &s;oul: In&s;tead of attending to our &s;ecular affairs, we &s;hould be incapable either of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure; even intere&s;t would want its u&s;ual &s;timulus, the verie&s;t Nig|gard would forget his unvi&s;ited hoard, and at la&s;t, when the blow was ju&s;t de&s;cending, with a fear|ful voice, and trembling hand, he would <HI>appoint a &s;ucce&s;&s;or;</HI> or what is full as probable, his ap|prehen&s;ions would predominate over all ideas of natural ju&s;tice, or el&s;e the &s;trange &s;ugge&s;tions of at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility, that de&s;tiny might delay to di&s;charge its pro|mi&s;e, would induce him to die amid&s;t the deceits of hope, and
<PB N="25" REF="30">leave his un&s;ecured property to the rapacity of law, and the con|te&s;t of various claimants. Mo&s;es, however, is repre&s;ented as going on, immediately after this, in the great affairs which were allotted to him. Undi&s;turbed by the common terrors of ordinary men, we &s;till find him tran&s;mitting the laws of life and eternity, from God to man: He continued, as before, to &s;ettle with the &s;ame &s;agacity, the moral, civil and religious &s;y&s;tem: He was the amanuen&s;is of Providence; and after he had done all the appointed &s;ervice to &s;ociety, he died at the age of one hundred and twenty years, in the fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of

<HEAD>ESSAY XXIV. STORY of CALEB and OTHNIEL.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND CALEB SAID, HE THAT SMITETH KIRJATH-SEPHER, AND TAKETH IT TO HIM WILL I GIVE ACHSAH MY DAUGH|TER TO WIFE.</Q>
<P>IN the &s;hort, but very plea&s;ing narratives of Caleb and Oth|niel, bravery and piety are pow|fully recommended and rewarded. Caleb's &s;tory is related by him&s;elf in the 14th chapter of Jo&s;hua,
<PB N="28" REF="33">from whence we ea&s;ily &s;ee into his character. Enamoured of glory him&s;elf, he naturally loved it in others; and being called to battle in a righteous cau&s;e, he propo&s;ed, by way of encouragement to the youthful heroes of his day, the mo&s;t precious prize in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion&mdash;even Ach&s;ah, his daughter. This propo&s;al fired the bo&s;om and, animated the exertions of the youth Othniel, who took it, and received the beautiful reward. With this fair pre&s;ent, it &s;hould &s;eem, he led a life of honour and virtue, ever warmly devoted to his God, and his country: for, after the death of Jo&s;hua, when the children of
<PB N="29" REF="34">I&s;rael again relap&s;ed into di&s;obedi|ence, and ingratitude, and the Almighty &s;old them to the king of Me&s;opotamia, as a puni&s;hment, Othniel was the per&s;on who, upon their repentance, was ordained to deliver them from the chains of captivity: and &s;uch was the wi&s;|dom of this hero's <HI>mind,</HI> that after he had re&s;cued them from &s;lavery by the valour of his arm, he kept the land in the compo&s;ure of peace forty years. All that time the place had re&s;t; nor do we hear of any farther flagrant in&s;tances of tre&s;pa&s;s, or violation, till after his death; upon which, that di&s;|obedient
<PB N="30" REF="35">people once more began to revolt, and degenerate.</P>
<P>The union of magnamity and moral goodne&s;s well de&s;erve the highe&s;t trea&s;ures of reward; and it were to be wi&s;hed, that the cou|rage of Othniel was con&s;tantly en|riched by the principles of Othniel. War, in <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> is certainly only a more legal butchery than private murder, but when the &s;word is drawn in a cau&s;e like this, where integrity was blended with intre|pidity, every bo&s;om is officious to &s;hare the honours, and every hand ready to be&s;tow the laurel. The father-in-law of Othniel was, him|&s;elf

How beautifully has be contrived to rehear&s;e his own &s;ucce&s;&s;es, without vain-glory, or o&s;tentation! And he &s;peaks of the &s;ervices he has done, and is &s;till able to do the &s;tate, without incurring from delicacy it&s;elf the character of a boa&s;ter. <Q>Forty years old was I, (&s;ays he) when Mo&s;es, the &s;ervant of the Lord &s;ent me from Kade&s;h-barnea to e&s;py out the land; and I brought him word again, as it was in mine heart. And Mo&s;es &s;ware on that day, &s;aying, &s;urely the
<PB N="32" REF="37">land whereon thy feet have trod|den, &s;hall be thine inheritance, and thy childrens' for ever; be|cau&s;e thou ha&s;t wholly followed the Lord thy God.

<PB N="33" REF="38">and to come in. Now, there|fore, give me this mountain, &amp;c. if &s;o be the Lord be with me then I &s;hall be able to drive them out.</Q></P>
<P>His plea was irre&s;i&s;tible. The whole &s;peech was &s;u&s;tained by a manly firmne&s;s, and a di&s;dain of all that nau&s;eous incen&s;e which is too frequently lavi&s;hed by the &s;er|vile petitioner. In con&s;equence of this oration, Jo&s;hua ble&s;&s;ed him, and willingly gave that which was reque&s;ted. His own con|que&s;ts thus paid, he was re&s;olved to do ju&s;tice to congenial merit: and, as an in&s;tance of his love of
<PB N="34" REF="39">glory, and an example to others, he gave his child to him who &s;hould mo&s;t de&s;erve her. Othniel had no &s;ooner obtained her, than the noble parent &s;ettled upon their i&s;&s;ue a fre&s;h inheritance of fields and &s;prings. Here it is not ea&s;y to glance at a deficiency of modern times&mdash;a deficiency long deplored, and &s;till remaining to be &s;o. Where is the adequate meed for the pre&s;ent race of con|querors?

<HEAD>ESSAY XXV. STORY of NAOMI and RUTH.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND RUTH SAID, INTREAT ME NOT TO LEAVE THEE, OR TO RETURN FROM FOLLOWING AFTER THEE; FOR WHI|THER THOU GOEST, I WILL GO; AND WHERE THOU LODGEST, I WILL LODGE: THY PEOPLE, SHALL BE MY PEOPLE; AND THY GOD, MY GOD.</Q>
<P>THERE never was any thing more happily conceived, or more &s;weetly told than the book of Ruth. It &s;eems chiefly de|&s;igned to exhibit to us a lively and
<PB N="38" REF="42">high-coloured picture of the force of female friend&s;hip on the one hand, and the weakne&s;s of re&s;olu|tion, when oppo&s;ed by cu&s;tom, on the other. The general circum|&s;tances of the &s;tory being un|commonly fine, will &s;peak be&s;t for them&s;elves, and afford proper comments in the progre&s;s of re|citing them.</P>
<P>When the famine raged with much &s;everity in her native land, Naomi, and her hu&s;band Elime|lech, and their two &s;ons, went to &s;ojourn in the country of Moab; but Elimelech died, and Naomi, the widow, was left with her chil|dren:
<PB N="39" REF="43">&s;oon after this, tho&s;e chil|dren <Q>took them wives of the wo|men of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the other Ruth.</Q> It came to pa&s;s that the young men, their hu&s;bands, died al&s;o, both of them, and now the poor widow was bereaved of her &s;ons and her hu&s;band. Unable, therefore, to bear any longer a place in which every &s;cene pre|&s;ented &s;ome image of lo&s;t endear|ment, or revived &s;ome di&s;tracting idea of conjugal or maternal ten|derne&s;s, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;olace from her &s;orrow, by change of re&s;idence. So &s;he aro&s;e with her daughters-in-law Orpah and Ruth,
<PB N="40" REF="44">that &s;he might return from the country of Moab. It pre&s;ently occured to the poor woman, as &s;he was journeying on her way, that if &s;he was her&s;elf unhappy, it was no te&s;timony of her affection to involve her &s;ons' wives in equal calamities; and judging the re|ception &s;he would be likely to meet in the land of Judah, enter|ing it de&s;olate, unfriended, and unadorned, &s;he pau&s;ed a moment, and thus pathetically addre&s;&s;ed the young widows: <Q>Go, my chil|dren, each of you return to your mother's hou&s;e; the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
<PB N="41" REF="45">The Lord grant that ye may find re&s;t, each of you, in the hou&s;e of your dear decea&s;ed hu&s;band.</Q>&mdash; Having uttered this &s;hort prayer for their happine&s;s, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed them, and prepared to depart alone. How true to nature was their reply! They did not pour forth unmeaning compliments of condolance&mdash;They did not inter|change any idle civilities of &s;or|row, for their angui&s;h was too &s;in|cere for ceremony&mdash;Neither did they enter into the parade of pro|mi&s;ing future interviews&mdash;for they &s;poke not at all. The extreme of grief has, at the fir&s;t &s;urprize, lit|tle to do with language&mdash;at the
<PB N="42" REF="46">mo&s;t, it bur&s;ts into &s;hort exclama|tions, as if it would &s;hew the im|po&s;&s;ibility of proceeding: for our alleviation, therefore, in the&s;e ca&s;es, that power, who to every wound hath provided &s;omething where|with to heal it, gave the comfort of tears, &s;o that the fullne&s;s of the &s;ad heart is, in part, di&s;charged by that kindly effu&s;ion which Provi|dence has intended as a fountain to relieve the exce&s;&s;es of nature; either in the &s;urplus of mi&s;ery, or tran&s;|port. <Q>They lift up their voice and wept</Q>&mdash;A folio could not &s;o well di&s;play their condition&mdash;After &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed in this kind of &s;ignificant &s;ilence, they &s;aid unto
<PB N="43" REF="47">her: <Q>Surely, we will return with thee unto thy people.</Q> Here again genuine grief di&s;covers it&s;elf: one tender &s;entence, and one only, ex|pre&s;&s;es their de&s;igns and wi&s;hes to attend her. In &s;uch ca&s;es, conci&s;e|ne&s;s is nature, and circumlocution, mere art and affectation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>pathetic,</HI> as well as the <HI>grand,</HI> &s;ays the mo&s;t elegant tran&s;lator of Longinus, is di&s;played as &s;trongly by &s;ilence, or a bare word, as in a number of periods. I will venture to &s;ay <HI>much more &s;trongly,</HI> by a &s;entence than a volume, in <HI>many</HI> ca&s;es, and in <HI>&s;ome</HI> (as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) total <HI>&s;ilence</HI> is more expre&s;&s;ive and characteri&s;tic than the mo&s;t feeling or forcible &s;entence.
<Q><L>There is a kind of mournful <HI>eloquence</HI></L>
<L>In a dumb grief, which &s;hames all clam'rous</L>
<L>Sorrow.</L></Q>
<P>Or, as a bard who better under&s;tood the operations of the human heart, more poetically has it,
<Q><L>My grief lies all within;</L>
<L>And tho&s;e external manners of laments</L>
<L>Are merely &s;hadows to the <HI>un&s;een</HI> grief</L>
<L>That &s;wells with <HI>&s;ilence</HI> in the tortur'd &s;oul.</L>
<L>There lies the &s;ub&s;tance.</L></Q> When words are too weak, &s;ays the critic, or co|lours too faint to pre&s;ent a <HI>pathos,</HI> as the poet will be &s;ilent, &s;o the painter will hide what he cannot &s;hew:&mdash;Mr. Smith hath offered a very fine example of this, wherein the &s;kill of Timanthes, the pain|ter, is &s;hewn in marking the gradations of &s;orrow in a groupe of characters, till he had exhau&s;ted the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ilence became nece&s;&s;ary to the la&s;t figure in the di&s;tre&s;ful climax; but nothing can furni&s;h a finer illu&s;tration than Orpah and Ruth.</P>
<P>Lord Kames, however, in his chapter upon the Language of Pa&s;&s;ion, after having ob&s;erved, that immoderate grief is mute, becau&s;e complaining is &s;truggling for con&s;olation, hath illu&s;trated that re|mark by &s;o apt a &s;tory from the 3d book of Hero|dotus, that I am &s;ure the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;|ed with me for &s;etting it down among&s;t the notes for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P><Q>Camby&s;es, when he conquered Egypt, took P&s;ammenitus the king pri&s;oner; and for trying his con&s;tancy, ordered his daughter to be dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a &s;lave, and to be employed in bringing water from the river; his &s;on al&s;o was led to execution with a halter about his neck. The Egyptians vented their &s;orrow in tears and lamentations; P&s;ammenitus only, with a down|ca&s;t eye, remained &s;ilent. Afterward meeting one of his companions, a man advanced in years, who, being plundered of all, was begging alms, he wept bitterly, calling him by his name. Cam|by&s;es, &s;truck with wonder, demanded an an&s;wer to the following que&s;tion:" 'P&s;ammenitus, thy ma&s;ter Camby&s;es is de&s;irous to know, why, after thou had&s;t &s;een thy daughter &s;o ignominiou&s;ly treated, and thy &s;on led to execution, without exclaiming or weeping, thou &s;hould&s;t be &s;o highly concerned for a poor man, no way related to thee?" "P&s;ammenitus returned the following an&s;wer:" 'Son of Cyrus, the calamities of my family are too great to leave me the power of weeping; but the misfortunes of a companion, reduced in his old age to want of bread, is a fit &s;ubject for lamentation.</Q></P></NOTE>. Per|ceiving the de&s;ign of the daughters,
<PB N="44" REF="48">the widow-woman Naomi again began to di&s;&s;uade them, and to
<PB N="45" REF="49">pre&s;s their &s;peedy return. She painted the various di&s;a&s;ters they
<PB N="46" REF="50">would be liable to, in her com|pany&mdash;told them &s;he had no more &s;ons to give them for hu&s;bands&mdash; nor even a hut, however uncheary, and forlorn, to accommodate them with in her own country&mdash;and furthermore, that &s;he had not wherewithal to repo&s;e her own head upon, if, after the fatigues of tra|vel, &s;he &s;hould haply arrive &s;afe. And, now &s;he once more pre&s;&s;ed the women in a farewel embrace, whil&s;t &s;he clo&s;ed her arguments with ano|ther ble&s;&s;ing, more melting even than the fir&s;t. <Q>Nay&mdash;my daugh|ters&mdash;weep not I intreat you. It grieveth me more for your &s;akes than my own, that the hand of the
<PB N="47" REF="51">Lord hath gone out again&s;t me.</Q> This was the touch&s;tone: &s;he had now fairly di&s;covered all the hor|rors of her &s;ituation, and &s;hewed her&s;elf a woman without accom|modation&mdash;a traveller without hope of re&s;t at the end of her journey, and a widow, without one to take her by the hand, and &s;ay unto her, Welcome unfortunate &mdash;welcome again to thine own coun|try. The picture was too darkly &s;haded for Orpah. The dread of poverty, and all its &s;able catalogue of terrors, &s;truck her at once: &s;he &s;hed the tribute of a few more tears&mdash;&s;acrificed a few more &s;ighs, and went her way. Not &s;o the
<PB N="48" REF="52">affectionate Ruth. How excel|lently marked, and that, by a &s;in|gle word, is the conduct of each. <Q>Orpah <HI>ki&s;&s;ed</HI> her mother-in-law; but Ruth <HI>clave</HI> unto her.</Q> The &s;entence, though thus compre&s;&s;ed, is emphatically copious in point of meaning: but, indeed, the <HI>multum in parvo,</HI> &s;hould be one characteri&s;tic of the &s;acred writ|ings. <Q>Orpah <HI>ki&s;&s;ed</HI> her mother-in|law,</Q> i. e. &s;he gave her a farewel embrace, wept a woman's &s;orrow, and left her mother to wander over the world. <Q>But Ruth <HI>clave</HI> unto her.</Q> Struck to the heart at the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing her friend and parent no more, and &s;till calling
<PB N="49" REF="53">to mind the thou&s;and endearments which had formerly made precious her &s;ociety, and even feeling &s;ome additional &s;ympathy from being involved in a calamity, which aro&s;e from the mi&s;chances of one hou&s;e, and one family, &s;he endured not the idea of her departure: &s;o far otherwi&s;e, indeed, that &s;he <Q><HI>clave</HI> unto her,</Q> i.e. clung round her neck&mdash;ki&s;&s;ed her with an ardour, as if &s;he de&s;igned to leave the &s;eal of her very &s;oul impre&s;&s;ed on her lips for ever. In vain did the no|ble-minded Naomi exhibit to her the various mi&s;eries which were at hand, and again&s;t which, there was no comfortable provi&s;ion&mdash;
<PB N="50" REF="54">In vain did &s;he point to the ex|ample, the politic and prudent ex|ample of Orpah, her &s;i&s;ter&mdash;In &s;corn of &s;uch conduct, and to clo&s;e at once all future di&s;&s;ua&s;ions, &s;he thus deelared, to the eternal ho|nour of her &s;ex, the glowing re&s;o|lutions of her &s;oul. <Q>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee, for whither thou goe&s;t, I will go; and where thou lodge&s;t, I will lodge: thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God my God.</Q> The whole beauty and force of this pa&s;&s;age is not &s;een at once: it is a very fine climax, and there is amazing elegance in the grada|tions.
<PB N="51" REF="55">The full &s;en&s;e implied, &s;eems to branch out in this man|ner. She begins with de&s;iring Naomi to urge the &s;ubject of &s;epa|ration no longer, &s;ince &s;he has completely made up her mind up|on it. This is the fir&s;t and <HI>&s;lighte&s;t</HI> part. In the next place, &s;he un|folds her fir&s;t de&s;ign to follow her fortunes in whatever part of the habitable globe &s;he thinks proper to pur&s;ue them: but not thinking this &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of her affection, &s;he re&s;olves to take up her abode in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her&mdash;to lodge under the &s;ame roof, however poor, and to &s;hare the &s;ame bed, however inelegant.&mdash;
<PB N="52" REF="56">After this, &s;he re&s;olves to know no other people, than &s;uch as are equally the common friends of both&mdash;to enter into no attach|ments, but tho&s;e which are united by the &s;ame tender ties to her dear Naomi; and to form no connec|tions whatever, that can, in the lea&s;t, derogate from the love &s;he bore her. But &s;he is not contented with having delivered the&s;e a&s;&s;ur|ances, for &s;he goes on, declaring that her very religion &s;hall be the religion of her friend&mdash;that one faith, and one hope, &s;hall animate their devotion, and that the God of one, &s;hall be the God of the other. Even this does not &s;atisfy
<PB N="53" REF="57">her: for, &s;he next determines not only to go with her the pilgrimage of life, but attend her <HI>beyond</HI> the gate of death&mdash;to die <HI>with</HI> her Naomi, &s;hould it be her Naomi's lot to fall fir&s;t, and to be buried at la&s;t in the &s;ame grave: and this &s;he confirmed by an immediate oath of the utmo&s;t importance and &s;anctity among&s;t the daughters of Judah: <Q>The Lord God do &s;o to me, aud more al&s;o, if ought but death</Q>&mdash;&s;he might have &s;aid&mdash;<HI>if</HI> death it&s;elf, part thee and me.</P>
<P><Q>When Naomi &s;aw that &s;he was &s;teadfa&s;tly minded to go, &s;he left
<PB N="54" REF="58">off per&s;uading her; &s;o they went until they came to Beth-lehem; and when they arrived, it came to pa&s;s, that all the city were mov|ed about them, and they &s;aid, Is this Naomi?</Q> Here are fre&s;h morals and fre&s;h elegancies opened upon us: the di&s;con&s;olate Naomi had no &s;ooner &s;et her foot upon her own land, than all tho&s;e little pa&s;&s;ions which lie lurking in the bo&s;oms of the illiberal and the in|ho&s;pitable, were in&s;tantly awaken|ed. Curio&s;ity &s;urveyed the tatters which &s;he had not the &s;oul to re|pair.&mdash;Ill-nature was, we may be &s;ure, officious enough to throw in her bitter &s;arca&s;m. Pride was
<PB N="55" REF="59">ready with her in&s;ulting offer of pity&mdash;Avarice lamented his inca|pacity to an&s;wer the good wi&s;hes of his heart; and in &s;hort, every arrogant, every paltry propen&s;ity was in arms again&s;t our defence|le&s;s travellers. But as Naomi ori|ginally lived in &s;ome degree of comfort and credit in her own country, and was now reduced, <HI>&s;he,</HI> of cour&s;e, more particularly was the mark of their obloquy and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Upon entering the city, there|fore, the mob flocked about her, to indulge the vulgar and villainous joy, of adding a fre&s;h load to the
<PB N="56" REF="60">heart which was already groaning under its burthen; for it is, but too generally the horrid maxim, to a&s;&s;i&s;t where a&s;&s;i&s;tance is unne|ce&s;&s;ary, and to <HI>deny</HI> &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance where it may be the means of continuing life, or of promoting happine&s;s. And they &s;aid one to another&mdash;mea&s;uring no doubt the poor wretch from top to toe; and noteing with cruel critici&s;m, every unfortunate particular&mdash;<Q>Is this Naomi?</Q> God of Heaven, as much as to &s;ay&mdash;is this the woman &mdash;the wife of Elimelech, who lived in &s;uch plenty&mdash;this poor ragged wretch&mdash;this &s;hadow of her&s;elf&mdash; "Is this Naomi?" Mercy upon us
<PB N="57" REF="61">&mdash;who would have thought it? Having exhau&s;ted all the unfeeling and hardened remarks, cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions, all their com|pa&s;&s;ion, and all their cruelty, ended exactly in the old way:&mdash;in leav|ing her the lo&s;s of &s;ome &s;ighs and tears&mdash;poorer than they found her. She &s;oon found, that to rely upon the kindne&s;s of old friends, was but a precarious mercy: for it is not bearing too hard I fear upon human nature to &s;uppo&s;e, that her very next-door neighbour, the very companion of all her girli&s;h &s;ports, would give with an ill grace, if &s;he gave at all, that pil|low, or that bread, of which, after
<PB N="58" REF="62">&s;o weary&s;ome a journey &s;he cer|tainly &s;tood much in need. Ill|u&s;ed by the world therefore, &s;he began to lo&s;e the hope of &s;uch re|&s;ources&mdash;the benevolence of di&s;|tant relations, in who&s;e memory &s;he might be able to revive the images of tenderne&s;s, was likewi&s;e a fond idea, that was born and buried almo&s;t in the &s;ame in&s;tant. Nothing of comfort &s;eemed to re|main in re&s;erve, till the excellent Ruth, the faithful partner of her &s;ufferings, &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient. And &s;he &s;aid unto her friend, I perceive, oh my dear Naomi, that our conveniencies mu&s;t depend upon our&s;elves, and that we mu&s;t
<PB N="59" REF="63">owe our daily bread, to our daily labour: as it is now the beginning of the harve&s;t, behold the oppor|tunity of exerting our&s;elves is at hand. Thou, indeed, art too much afflicted to toil: but for my part &mdash;much and tenderly as I &s;ympa|thize with thee, I am in the prime of my youth, and able to gather &s;omething from the field: <Q>Let me now therefore go and glean ears of corn after him in who&s;e &s;ight I may find grace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now it was &s;o, that Naomi had a kin&s;man of her hu&s;band's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his
<PB N="60" REF="64">name was Boaz:</Q> and it hap|pened as Ruth was gleaning af|ter the reapers, &s;he was &s;ituate on a part of the field belong|ing to Boaz. This circum|&s;tance occa&s;ioned a turn of fortune perfectly dramatic. For, Boaz, coming to take a view of his reapers, perceiving the &s;tranger, &s;aid unto the &s;ervant who was &s;et over the reapers, <Q>Who&s;e dam&s;el is this?</Q> The &s;ervant's an&s;wer is penned with the mo&s;t natural &s;implicity. <Q>It is the Moabiti&s;h dam&s;el, that came back with Naomi, out of the country of Moab: and &s;he &s;aid, I pray you let me glean, and gather
<PB N="61" REF="65">after the reapers among the &s;heaves: &s;o &s;he came and hath continued among&s;t us even from the morning until now, that &s;he tarried a little in the hou&s;e.</Q> Something there was either in this account, or in the appearance of the object, which won much upon the favour of the landlord: for it is &s;urely a &s;ofter voice, even than the voice of ho&s;|pitality, that &s;peaks in the &s;equel. <Q>Heare&s;t thou not my daughter? go not I charge you to glean in any other field, neither go from hence, but abide here fa&s;t by <HI>my</HI> maidens.</Q> I have given par|ticular injunctions to <Q>the <HI>young
<PB N="62" REF="66">men</HI> that they &s;hall not touch thee. And when thou art a|thir&s;t, go to the ve&s;&s;els, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</Q> Here, be|gan the fir&s;t fruits of her fidelity; and the partiality of Boaz made a very rapid progre&s;s, for in his &s;econd addre&s;s he was more bene|volent than in the fir&s;t: He in|vited her to con&s;ider her&s;elf, as one of his own people, to <Q>eat of the bread, to dip her welcome mor&s;el in the vinegar</Q> at meal times, and to &s;it chearfully be&s;ide the reap|ers. Nay more, with his own hand&mdash;&s;urely the heart extended it&mdash;<Q>he reached her <HI>parched</HI> corn,
<PB N="63" REF="67">and &s;he did eat, and was &s;uffi|ced and left.</Q> <HI>Now</HI> it was that Boaz began to di&s;cover more evidently, that, the &s;pring of this generous current lay very near the heart: When &s;he was ri&s;en up to glean after her repa&s;t, he com|manded the young men to &s;hew her all po&s;&s;ible marks of courte&s;y and di&s;tinction. His &s;trict orders were, not to &s;uffer her to gather the &s;canty pittance, ear by ear, af|ter the cautious rake had gone over the ground, but to let <HI>her</HI> glean unque&s;tioned, even <HI>among&s;t the &s;heaves.</HI> Nay more, they were to let &s;ome handfulls fall on <HI>pur|po&s;e</HI> for her, and leave them for
<PB N="64" REF="68">her particular gleaning: And in|deed, &s;uch was the &s;ucce&s;sful con|&s;equence of the&s;e indulgences, that after &s;he had beat out what &s;he had been permitted to glean in one &s;ingle day, <Q>it was about an ephah of barley.</Q> This, the kind creature carried with all the expe|dition of affection to her friend: and when Naomi &s;aw it&mdash;when the &s;oul of the &s;orrowful widow &s;ang for joy; then Ruth related to her the whole hi&s;tory of her good fortune, and concluding that the name of the ho&s;pitable owner of the land was Boaz. This in|telligence revived her &s;pirits like a cordial, and &s;he exclaims with the
<PB N="65" REF="69">mo&s;t animated tran&s;port: <Q>the man is near a-kin to us,</Q> my beloved Ruth&mdash;<Q>one of our <HI>next</HI> kin&s;men.</Q> Often, and with equal &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he went after this into the field, and continued there to earn a very comfortable living for her&s;elf and her friend, even to the clo&s;e of the harve&s;t. In the mean time, the pa&s;&s;ion of Boaz had made a very pathetic progre&s;s, and the re|&s;ult of it was, that he became the honourable lover of our fair glean|er, and renewed his acquaintance with his relation Naomi, to whom he made, we are told, various pre|&s;ents. Boaz and Ruth were &s;oon united, and, as a convincing in|&s;tance
<PB N="66" REF="70">of the harmony in which the family lived together, we find, highly to the gratification of every elegant heart, that when Ruth pre&s;ented to Boaz a child&mdash;her fir&s;t-born&mdash;Naomi,&mdash;after all the perils of her pa&s;t life,&mdash;re-enjoyed the &s;weets of privacy and peace: <Q>for &s;he took the babe, and laid it in her bo&s;om, and became nur&s;e unto it:</Q> And I mu&s;t not forget to add, that this very child, who&s;e name was Obed, was the grandfather of the famous David, to who&s;e pen, the P&s;alms are at|tributed; which, both as pieces of &s;cripture and of writing, are to|tally unrivalled in point of energy
<PB N="67" REF="71">and &s;ublimity, by any compo&s;ition that hath yet been, or that pro|bably ever will be, produced in human language.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly our Engli&s;h Vir|gil, the author of the Sea&s;ons, took from this &s;tory the hint of his epi&s;ode of Palemon and La|vinia: but, beautiful as that epi|&s;ode may be, I by no means think he hath improved the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject. Indeed, it is not <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to improve any of the &s;acred narra|tives, nor was Mr. Thom&s;on a poet of &s;implicity. He hath, however, followed the original pretty clo&s;ely, e&s;pecially in the
<PB N="68" REF="72">principal incidents: yet Palemon is a poor copy of Boaz, and La|vinia is le&s;s captivating than Ruth.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall quote Mr. Thom|&s;on's poetical paraphra&s;e&mdash;for it is little more&mdash;that the reader may compare it with the original.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XV. GOLIAH of GATH.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND DAVID SAID UNTO SAUL, LET NO MAN'S HEART FAIL BECAUSE OF HIM: THY SERVANT WILL GO AND FIGHT WITH THIS PHILISTINE.</Q>
<P>IT is very remarkable, that all tho&s;e per&s;onages of &s;acred me|mory, who&s;e tran&s;actions are re|corded in the biographical parts of the Bible, have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for per&s;onal bravery in the mo&s;t early periods of life.
<PB N="80" REF="83">Thus, Mo&s;es, yet a child, &s;mote the Egyptian in defence of his brother; and, in the ca&s;e before us, the youth David, who was, even <HI>before</HI> this time, &s;o enchanting a mu&s;ician, as to vanqui&s;h an evil &s;pirit by the melody of his harp, commences an illu&s;trious and war|like character all at once, by &s;ub|duing the man, of whom, whole armies were afraid, in &s;ingle com|bat. This hi&s;tory, is, likewi&s;e, fruitful of very fine things, and favourable to the remark of a com|mentator. There is a &s;kill ob|&s;ervable in the <HI>conduct</HI> of the &s;a|cred narratives rarely, if ever, &s;een in other writings: and it &s;hall he
<PB N="81" REF="84">the bu&s;ine&s;s of this illu&s;tration to &s;hew, that the chain of <HI>real</HI> cir|cum&s;tances relating to the duel betwixt David and Goliah, is, from the beginning to the end, from the fir&s;t &s;yllable to the la&s;t, a match for any compo&s;ition what|ever&mdash;&s;etting a&s;ide the matter of <HI>&s;cripture</HI>&mdash;even in point of what the dramati&s;ts call <HI>fable.</HI> And I am thus particularly earne&s;t to di&s;|play, in this work, the <HI>literary</HI> excellence of the Holy Bible, be|cau&s;e I have rea&s;on to apprehend it is too frequently laid by, under a notion of its being a dull, dry, and unentertaining &s;y&s;tem; whereas the fact is quite otherwi&s;e: it con|tains
<PB N="82" REF="85">all that can be <HI>wi&s;hed,</HI> by the true&s;t intellectual ta&s;te; it enters more &s;agaciou&s;ly, and more deep|ly, into human nature; it deve|lopes character, delineates man|ner, charms the imagination, and warms the heart more effectually than any other book extant: and if once a man would take it into his hand, without that &s;trange prejudicing idea of its flatne&s;s, and be willing to be plea&s;ed, I am morally certain he would find all his favourite authors dwindle in the compari&s;on, and conclude, that he was not only reading the mo&s;t religious, but the mo&s;t <HI>entertain|ing</HI> book in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">
It is my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, there|fore, to di&s;play the &s;tory now un|der con&s;ideration, as a perform|ance, written with the greate&s;t art, and managed with the mo&s;t ma&s;|terly judgment. This will be&s;t be done, by &s;electing, from the whole matter, particular pa&s;&s;ages, and making a few comments thereupon.</P>
<P>The very exordium of the &s;tory pre&s;ents us with an image, that prepares us for &s;omething extra|ordinary.</P>
<P><Q>Saul and the men of I&s;rael were gathered together, and
<PB N="84" REF="87">pitched by the valley of Elah, and &s;et the battle in array, a|gain&s;t the Phili&s;tines. And the Phili&s;tines &s;tood on a mountain on the one &s;ide, and I&s;rael &s;tood on a mountain on the other, and there was a valley <HI>between</HI> them.</Q> Fancy her&s;elf could not have imagined any thing more picture&s;que; nor could any mar|tial &s;kill have made a more aweful arrangement. The next circum|&s;tance is as intere&s;ting as unex|pected: <Q>And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Phili&s;tines, named Goliah of Gath.</Q> The de&s;cription of this man is every way &s;uited to
<PB N="85" REF="88">alarm; and I will be bold to &s;ay, far tran&s;cends in equipment the heroes of Homer him&s;elf. I &s;ub|mit it to all the poetical enthu&s;i|a&s;ts. <Q>His height was &s;ix cubits and a &s;pan: he had an helment of bra&s;s upon his head, and was armed with a coat of mail; and the <HI>weight of the coat</HI> was five thou&s;and &s;hekles of bra&s;s.</Q> I mu&s;t here interrupt the narrative, to ob&s;erve, with what &s;kill we are told of the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of Goliah. It is not mentioned in the ordinary way, by a recital of his former atchievements, but it is implied by the prodigious burthen he was able to bear upon his back; for, be&s;ides
<PB N="86" REF="89">that, <Q>the head of his &s;pear weigh|ed <HI>&s;ix hundred</HI> &s;hekles of <HI>iron,</HI></Q> the <Q>weight of his coat was <HI>five thou&s;and</HI> &s;hekles of <HI>bra&s;s.</HI></Q> But to go on.</P>
<P><Q>And he had greaves of bra&s;s upon his legs, and a target of bra&s;s between his &s;houlders: and the &s;taff of his &s;pear was like a weaver's beam; and his &s;pear's head weighed &s;ix hun|dred &s;hekles of iron; and one, bearing a &s;hield, went before him.</Q> The terror and con&s;ter|nation with which this gigantic appearance mu&s;t &s;trike the &s;pecta|tors, is much ea&s;ier conceived than it can be de&s;cribed. All mu&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="90">have been &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and &s;ilent agi|tation&mdash;the I&s;raelites mu&s;t look at the man of Gath, with di&s;may; and the Phili&s;tines mu&s;t have view|ed their warrior as the tremendous tower of their &s;trength. His ad|dre&s;s to the armies of the adver&s;e party, could only &s;erve to heighten their apprehen&s;ions, for he defied the whole force of I&s;rael, and thir&s;ted for war, as if it were an appetite in him: <Q>Give me a man (&s;aid he), give me a man, that we may fight together.</Q> What a &s;anguinary &s;entence! it &s;macks of blood and of di&s;patch: it &s;hews at once, an eagerne&s;s to de&s;troy, and to &s;eize a &s;econd victim. Even
<PB N="88" REF="91">Saul was daunted at the challenge, and in all the tribes of embattled I&s;|rael (among&s;t which were the bro|thers of David) there could not be found a man to accept it. The unri|valled Phili&s;tine, in all the arro|gance of &s;uperiority and triumph, repeated the challenge, morning and evening, for forty days.&mdash; About this time, young David was di&s;patched by his father Je&s;&s;e to carry provi&s;ions to his brethren in the camp; for this office he was called up from the pa&s;toral em|ployment of tendence on the flocks. The&s;e, he left to the care of another keeper, and went, as he had been commanded; <Q>And
<PB N="89" REF="92">he came to the trench as the armies of the ho&s;t were go|ing forth to the fight, and were &s;houting for the battle: for I&s;rael and the Phili&s;tines had put the battle in array, army again&s;t army.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;tripling could not have ar|rived in a more critical time, nor at any more likely to awake in him the &s;parks of glory, e&s;pecially as his brethren were all engaged in the cau&s;e. He had &s;carce fini&s;hed the fir&s;t &s;alutations with his brethren, before another matter fell out won|derfully well calculated to kindle the flame of honour; for, while
<PB N="90" REF="93">he was conver&s;ing with his breth|ren, there came up the Phili&s;tine of Gath again, and, with addi|tional in&s;olence, announced his defiance. The I&s;raelites were &s;ore afraid, and ingloriou&s;ly fled. David's brethren, then, related to him, the <HI>former</HI> menaces of Goliah, and the promi&s;es of reward which the king offered to any man who &s;hould kill him&mdash;that the hou&s;e of the conqueror's father was to be free, and the victor him&s;elf, to have great riches, and the hand of the king's daughter. How finely is the nature of envy and warlike ambition touched in the conduct of David's brother, when the lad
<PB N="91" REF="94">fir&s;t &s;hewed the dawnings of his &s;pirit: and this is carried &s;till higher, when Saul him&s;elf ex|pre&s;&s;es, afterwards, the jealou&s;y of his heart, at his being called only the Slayer of Thou&s;ands, while to David's arm the women a&s;cribed victory over <HI>Tens</HI> of Thou&s;ands. But of this in its place. Some &s;trokes of emulation there were in David's di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;oon reached the ear of the general, and which procured him an im|mediate interview. Courage is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: the young man is repre&s;ented as &s;peaking to Saul, with even more intrepidity than he &s;pake to his brethren. In
<PB N="92" REF="95">the fir&s;t part of his conver&s;ation he addre&s;&s;es him upon the &s;ubject, with all the ardour of a glowing and inde|pendent &s;pirit. He &s;aid: <Q>Let no man's heart fail him, becau&s;e of this Goliah; thy <HI>&s;ervant,</HI> will go, and fight with the Phili&s;tine.</Q> Mode&s;t, but glorious: thy <HI>&s;ervant</HI> will, at lea&s;t, go and <HI>fight</HI> with this pre&s;umptuous boa&s;ter. It was na|tural for Saul to treat this offer at fir&s;t, as a &s;ally of juvenile &s;pi|rit, laudable enough, but nothing effectual; and his reply to it mu&s;t have been delivered &s;milingly. Thou, child! Thou art not able to go again&s;t this Phili&s;tine, to fight with him: for thou art but
<PB N="93" REF="96">a youth, though a brave one; <Q>and he a man of war from his youth</Q> &mdash;from his very infancy, trained to the knowledge and exerci&s;e of arms. The mode&s;ty, brevity, and conci&s;ene&s;s with which our young hero a&s;&s;erts his preten&s;ions to &s;uc|ce&s;s from this engagement, is in|conceivably pretty, and attracting.</P>
<P><Q>Thy &s;ervant kept his fa|ther's &s;heep, and there came a lion and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</Q></P>
<P><Q>And <HI>I</HI> went out after him, and &s;mote him, and delivered the lamb out of his mouth, and
<PB N="94" REF="97">when he aro&s;e again, I caught him by his beard, and &s;mote him, and flew him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thy &s;ervant &s;lew both, the lion and the bear: and this un|circumci&s;ed Phili&s;tine &s;hall be one of them, &s;eeing he hath de|fied the armies of the living God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me al&s;o out of the hand of this Phili&s;tine
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This gallant and mode&s;t addre&s;s, attended as it is with every prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance, bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to the &s;tory of young Norval in the Tragedy of Douglas, when he di&s;plays his heroic &s;pirit, and is fir&s;t admitted into the pre&s;ence of Lord and Lady Randolph. Perhaps, the author really had the bravery of the conqueror of Goliak in his eye, which is the more likely, as an inti|timate acquaintance with the &s;criptures, and, no doubt, a veneration for them, was in the way of Mr. Hume's profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudies.

<L>Whom, with a troop of fifty cho&s;en men,</L>
<L>I met advancing. The pur&s;uit I led,</L>
<L>Till we o'ertook the &s;poil-encumber'd foe.</L>
<L>We fought and conquer'd. Ere a &s;word was drawn,</L>
<L>An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,</L>
<L>Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.</L>
<L>Retiring home in triumph, I di&s;dain'd</L>
<L>The &s;hepherd's &s;lothful life; and having heard</L>
<L>That our good king hard &s;ummon'd his bold peers</L>
<L>To lead their warriors to the Carron &s;ide,</L>
<L>I left my father's hou&s;e, and took with me</L>
<L>A cho&s;en &s;ervant to conduct my &s;teps:&mdash;</L>
<L>Yon trembling coward who for&s;ook his ma&s;ter.</L>
<L>Journeying with this intent, I pa&s;t the&s;e towers,</L>

<L>The happy deed that gilds my humble name.</L></Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98">
Saul was &s;o charmed with his bravery and herioc &s;entiments,
<PB N="96" REF="99">that he began already to hope &s;omething from his efforts, in&s;o|much, that he &s;aid: <Q>Go, my lad, and the Lord go with thee.</Q> But the preparatory ceremony,
<PB N="97" REF="100">which &s;ucceeded this commi&s;&s;ion, is mo&s;t beautiful, indeed! De|lighted with his generous ambi|tion, Saul, with his own hand and acoutrements, equipped David for the battle; he put an helmet of bra&s;s upon his head, and defended his body with a coat of mail; then, girding his &s;word upon his armour, he a&s;&s;ayed to go&mdash;but&mdash; touched by &s;ome &s;ecret in&s;piration &mdash;he again dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the armour, and putting only five &s;mooth &s;tones out of the brook, he took his &s;taff, his &s;crip, and his &s;ling, and thus, like a &s;hepherd, drew near to the Phili&s;tine. There
<PB N="98" REF="101">is great imagery in the following ver&s;es.</P>
<P><Q>And the Phili&s;tine came on, and the man that bare the &s;hield went before him; and when the Phili&s;tine looked about and &s;aw David, he <HI>di&s;dained</HI> him.</Q> <HI>Di&s;dained</HI> is, perhaps, the only word in this language that could have been u&s;ed properly on this occa&s;ion. There was &s;o palpable a difference between the combatants, and the &s;uperiority and &s;trength evidently lay &s;o much on the &s;ide of Goliah, that he <HI>di&s;dained</HI> to fight with him, very naturally thinking him no object of <HI>his</HI> &s;pear: for David had
<PB N="99" REF="102">every per&s;onal advantage, being a lad of a ruddy and fair counte|nance.</P>
<P>It never entered into the imagi|nation of the Phili&s;tine that the battle was not always to the &s;trong, nor the race to the &s;wift. The ideas of a more powerful Provi|dence were &s;wallowed up in the vanity of his own vigour; and yet that vanity was &s;omewhat piqued, when he beheld our daring youth meet him only with a &s;tick, and a &s;tring. <Q>Am I a dog, that thou come&s;t to me with &s;taves?</Q> This &s;oon exa&s;perated him, and he cur&s;ed David by <HI>his own gods.</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="103">Whoever examines the &s;criptures, will find the nice&s;t pre&s;ervation of character, each delicately de&s;crimi|nated, and &s;o admirably con|tra&s;ted, that nothing which marks one, is given heterogenou&s;ly, to another. This has al&s;o been con|&s;idered among the fir&s;t excellencies of compo&s;ition: its beauty is ma|nife&s;ted in Shake&s;pear much, but in the Bible more. An in&s;tance of this is before us. We never once lo&s;e &s;ight of the &s;avage auda|city of Goliah, from his fir&s;t me|nace to his death&mdash;he &s;peaks but little, but every word &s;eems to fall from the lip of a giant. When David per&s;i&s;ts in his re&s;olution to
<PB N="101" REF="104">fight, he &s;aid, <Q>Come to me, and I will give thy fle&s;h unto the fowls of the air, and to the bea&s;ts of the field.</Q> The dependence of Da|vid was upon his God, and in &s;uch confidence he returned the threat of Goliah with additional fury. <Q>This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I will &s;mite thee, and take thine head from thee, that all the earth may know there is a <HI>God</HI> in I&s;|rael: and all this a&s;&s;embly &s;hall know that the Lord &s;aveth not with the <HI>&s;word and &s;pear;</HI> for the battle <HI>is the Lord's,</HI> and <HI>he</HI> will give you into our hands.</Q> They engaged, and the prophe&s;y
<PB N="102" REF="105">of the young warrior was fulfilled. The power of the Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance which can make all human &s;trength more feeble than the &s;inews of the new-born babe, is nobly il|lu&s;trated in the death of Goliah, which, notwith&s;tanding all appear|ances, was effected by a &s;tone ejected by a very boy, from a &s;ling. But the account it&s;elf is well worth reciting.</P>
<P><Q>And it came to pa&s;s, when the Phili&s;tine aro&s;e, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David ha&s;ted, and ran to|ward the army to meet the Phi|li&s;tine. And David put his
<PB N="103" REF="106">hand in his bag, and took thence a &s;tone and &s;lang it, and &s;mote the Phili&s;tine in his forehead, that the &s;tone <HI>&s;unk</HI> into his fore|head; and he fell upon his face unto the earth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then he ran and &s;tood upon the Phili&s;tine, and took the &s;word of Goliah, and drew it out of the &s;heath, and &s;lew him and cut off his head therewith: and when the Phili&s;tines &s;aw their champion was dead, they fled.</Q></P>
<P>By &s;uch means was the victory completed, and thus fell that ter|ror
<PB N="104" REF="107">to the I&s;raeliti&s;h bands, Go|liah of Gath.</P>
<P>Having gone through the mo&s;t important parts of this intere&s;ting duel, we have lei&s;ure for a few &s;upplemental reflections, in the way of literary critici&s;m. This Goliah of Gath reminds one of Homer's Ajax; and, indeed, the proce&s;s of the engagement between the giant and David, is, in many particulars, like the ceremony of the &s;ingle combat of Telamon and Hector. The above de&s;cription of Goliah's per&s;on, and warlike preparations, are more military and formidable than the hero of
<PB N="105" REF="108">Homer. Let the foregoing cha|racter of the Giant of Gath be com|pared with what follows:
<Q><L>Now Ajax brac'd his dazzling armour on,</L>
<L>Sheath'd in bright &s;teel, the giant warrior &s;hone:</L>
<L>He moves to combat with maje&s;tic pace;</L>
<L>So &s;talks in arms, the grizly god of Thrace.</L>
<L>Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god:</L>
<L>Grimly he &s;mil'd; earth trembled as he &s;trode;</L>
<L>His ma&s;&s;ey javelin, quiv'ring in his hand,</L>
<L>He &s;tood the bulwark of the Grecian band.</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry Argive heart new tran&s;port ran;</L>
<L>All Troy &s;tood trembling at the mighty man;</L>
<L>Ev'n Hector paus'd; and with new doubt oppre&s;s'd;</L>
<L>Felt his great heart &s;u&s;pended in his brea&s;t.</L></Q> Scarce any part of this de&s;cription,
<PB N="106" REF="109">nor of its original, will bear bring|ing near that of the <Q>giant war|rior</Q> of the &s;cripture. His mov|ing with maje&s;tic pace to combat, is le&s;s terrific than Goliah's trium|phant march in the full view of the a&s;toni&s;hed Phili&s;tines. There &s;eems al&s;o le&s;s propriety in Hec|tor's <HI>pau&s;e of fear,</HI> than in the in|apprehen&s;ive and intrepid conduct of David, who, though not prac|ti&s;ed like Hector,
<Q><L>From right to left the dextrous lance to wield,</L>
<L>And bear thick battle on his &s;ounding &s;hield;</L></Q> was, neverthele&s;s, uniformly brave and heroic to the very heart,
<PB N="107" REF="110">without ever finding that heroi&s;m &s;u&s;pended, even at the pre&s;ence of Goliah. "All <HI>Troy</HI>" might, in|deed, be &s;uppo&s;ed to tremble at the mighty &s;on of Telamon, in the &s;ame manner as Saul and the tribes of embattled I&s;rael, trem|bled before the arrogant Phili&s;tine: but for Hector's heart to fail him, though but for a moment, was, &s;urely, &s;uch a falling off from the idea we wi&s;h to entertain of that celebrated hero, that one is almo&s;t angry with Homer for doing our favourite &s;o palpable an injury in the tendere&s;t and brighte&s;t part of his character. It may be urged, indeed, that David had confidence in
<PB N="108" REF="111">his God, and that his bravery ema|nated from in&s;piration. An ar|gument, very &s;imilar, may be brought in favour of the Trojan hero, who, as we are to believe, certainly tru&s;ted as much in the virtue of <HI>his</HI> cau&s;e, and the good|ne&s;s of <HI>his</HI> god, as the other; nor did the poet ever &s;uffer him to go to the battle till tho&s;e deities were fir&s;t &s;upplicated. Witne&s;s the addre&s;s offered up, on the very occa&s;ion of the conte&s;t with Ajax.</P>
<Q><L>Oh, Father of mankind, &s;uperior lord,</L>
<L>On lofty Ida's holy hill ador'd:</L>
<L>Who in the highe&s;t Heav'n has fix'd thy throne,</L>
<L>Supreme of gods, unbounded, and alone:</L>
<L>Grant thou, &amp;c.</L></Q>

The &s;hield of Ajax is, however, more particularly de&s;cribed than the &s;hield of Goliah.

<L>Huge was its orb, with &s;even thick folds o'erca&s;t,</L>
<L>Of tough bull-hides, of &s;olid bra&s;s, the la&s;t.</L></Q> But the circum&s;tantial account of the giant's &s;pear, the weight of its head, his greaves of bra&s;s, and his target; his coat of mail, and his ma&s;&s;ey helmet, are all &s;uch evi|dences of his a&s;toni&s;hing STRENGTH, and, apparently, invincible vigour, that, without any parade or &s;uper|fluity of words, they give us the ex|act
<PB N="110" REF="113">image of the &s;avage, who called out, in an exclamation, worthy of him, <Q>Give me a man, give me a man, that we may fight together.</Q></P>
<P>But if, indeed, we expect in any performance to find a character delineated with parallel force&mdash;if we wi&s;h to read any de&s;cription like Goliah of Gath, we mu&s;t &s;earch for it in the writings of one, who&s;e in&s;piration was chiefly drawn from the &s;ources of &s;acred compo|&s;ition.

<HEAD>ESSAY XXVI. STORY of ELIJAH and the Widow of ZAREPHATH.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND SHE SAID, AS THE LORD THY GOD LIVETH, I HAVE NOT A CAKE, BUT A HANDFUL OF MEAL IN A BARREL, AND A LITTLE OIL IN A CRUSE.</Q>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age is pregnant with plea&s;ing illu&s;trations, being taken from a &s;tory inferior to few, if any, in &s;acred compo&s;ition: for it not only abounds with mo&s;t agreeable incidents, but furni&s;hes
<PB N="114" REF="117">a &s;triking and con&s;picuous moral: the virtue of Gratitude is very emphatically illu&s;trated on the one hand, and the duty of Ho&s;pitali|ty, on the other. Nor has it e&s;caped, indeed, the remark of &s;everal writers; but the &s;criptures, as I have before had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, are trea&s;uries affording inexhau&s;ted novelty to their ad|mirers.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons particularly con|cerned in this &s;acred drama, are, Elijah the prophet, and a poor widow-woman, who lived, by very hard and con&s;tant labour; <HI>&s;o</HI> hard indeed, that &s;he was obliged to
<PB N="115" REF="118">pick her faggot to light her fire, before &s;he could bake the bread, which that labour had gleaned. At the time of her fir&s;t meeting with Elijah, &s;he was more than <HI>u&s;ually</HI> &s;traightened; for her whole &s;tock con&s;i&s;ted of a handful of meal, and a little oil; and &s;he was then &s;tooping, in &s;earch of a few &s;ticks, to dre&s;s this &s;canty modi|cum, to pre&s;erve from death, her|&s;elf and her &s;on. Yet this was the critical period&mdash;even while &s;he was thus <HI>affectionately</HI> employed&mdash; this was the moment marked out by Providence, to try the &s;trength of her &s;ympathy: it was alas! no time to be&s;tow, while her bounty
<PB N="116" REF="119">was thus circum&s;cribed: nor was it a fit &s;ea&s;on to &s;hew the <HI>natural</HI> courte&s;y of her temper, when &s;he was exerting her la&s;t efforts in re|lief of her child, and wanted, in the &s;ore&s;t degree, the ordinary ac|commodations of life her&s;elf. Un|der this pre&s;&s;ure of her circum|&s;tances, it is worth while to &s;ee how &s;he conducted her&s;elf. When Elijah the prophet (who figures &s;o &s;plendidly in &s;acred hi&s;tory) foretold, that a divine puni&s;hment &s;hould alight upon Ahab (a man, who is repre&s;ented as wicked and ill-di&s;po&s;ed above all that were before him) then, to e&s;cape that re&s;entment, which his prophecy
<PB N="117" REF="120">had kindled again&s;t him in the brea&s;t of Ahab, he hid him&s;elf by the brook Cherith, where the <HI>ravens</HI> were commanded to cater for his &s;upport, while the brook &s;upplied him with drink. The re&s;ource of the &s;tream however &s;oon failing, he again &s;ought &s;hel|ter el&s;ewhere, and removed to Zarephath, where he no &s;ooner arrived, than he beheld this widow|woman engaged, as before de&s;crib|ed, in gathering &s;ticks; and he im|mediately called to her, and re|que&s;ted her to fetch him a little water in a ve&s;&s;el. This was not unrea&s;onable; but did not he ren|der it &s;omewhat &s;o, when he again
<PB N="118" REF="121">called her back as &s;he was ha&s;ten|ing to oblige him, to de&s;ire &s;he would bring a mor&s;el of <HI>bread</HI> likewi&s;e in her hand? A <HI>mor&s;el</HI> of bread, and a <HI>little</HI> water, was, to be &s;ure, a&s;king the favour in as de|cent language as could be; but in this poor woman's particular &s;ituation, it mu&s;t have had a very important &s;ound: there is a mo&s;t beautiful di&s;play of her charitable heart, in her an&s;wer.&mdash;<Q>As the Lord thy God liveth, I have <HI>not a cake,</HI> but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cru&s;e: and behold, I am gathering <HI>two</HI> &s;ticks that I may go in and dre&s;s it for me and my &s;on, that we
<PB N="119" REF="122">may eat it <HI>and die:</HI></Q> as if &s;he had &s;aid, you &s;ee my &s;tock, &s;tranger&mdash; it is my very la&s;t meal&mdash;I am picking <HI>two</HI> &s;ticks that I may lay my poor meal acro&s;s, and then&mdash; (as all further re&s;ources fail)&mdash;my child and I will die in the arms of one another. Then it was, that Eli|jah bid her not fear, for that <Q>the barrel of meal &s;hould not <HI>wa&s;te,</HI> nor the cru&s;e of oil <HI>fail</HI> unto the day that the Lord &s;endeth rain upon the face of the earth;</Q> and this he a&s;&s;ured her, was the &s;enti|ment of God him&s;elf. Now, had this woman been inclined to &s;ave her meal and oil to her&s;elf&mdash;had &s;he been &s;wayed, or indeed <HI>ought</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="123">influenced by that powerful &s;elf|love which has &s;o general an a&s;|cendency in the human brea&s;t; or had &s;he even yielded to the force of tho&s;e <HI>prudent</HI> maxims which teach, that, charity begins at <HI>home,</HI> and that &s;elf-pre&s;ervation is <HI>nature's fir&s;t law,</HI> how ea&s;ily might &s;he have evaded this reque&s;t? nay, what a &s;warm of right, &s;ound apo|logies pre&s;ented them&s;elves for a fair denial! To the rea&s;ons al|ready urged &s;he might (had &s;he been a woman of the world) have added many others: &s;uch as the expecting condition in which &s;he left her half-fami&s;hed <HI>child</HI>&mdash;her <HI>own</HI> extreme hunger, and the <HI>piety</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="124">of pre&s;erving her&s;elf and her lit|tle one, as long as &s;he could po&s;|&s;ibly find the &s;malle&s;t means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. That to die, while yet a meal remained, would be a kind of <HI>&s;uicide;</HI> and to give a mor&s;el from any part of her own family, when a mor&s;el was all that was left for the &s;upport of <HI>two,</HI> would be a prodigality for which &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to &s;uffer the poverty that mu&s;t inevitably re&s;ult from it. As to its being, as he &s;aid, the com|mand of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> &s;he might rea&s;onably offer a doubt as to the <HI>truth</HI> of that particular. Is there not&mdash;&s;he might reply&mdash;is there not, &s;omething of incon&s;i&s;tency,
<PB N="122" REF="125">good &s;tranger, in this part of your &s;tory? That we &s;hould <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t one another,</HI> is, I know a &s;ocial and a religious duty; but this mu&s;t be where plenty, or at lea&s;t compe|tence, pre&s;ents us with the de|lightful <HI>power.</HI>&mdash;It is not indeed &s;urprizing that I, (being the fir&s;t per&s;on you have &s;een) &s;hould be the fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, be|cau&s;e I know hunger catches at the &s;lighte&s;t and neare&s;t po&s;&s;ibili|ties: but excu&s;e me, if I think the matter of the promi&s;ed <HI>mira|cles</HI> not a little problematical. Would God have directed your application to a poor <HI>defencele&s;s</HI> widow-woman, who has a father|le&s;s
<PB N="123" REF="126">child to toil for, and is now labouring in the la&s;t exigency.&mdash; Would he have &s;aid&mdash;let her di|vide her all with you? Would <HI>He,</HI> who knows human nature &s;o intimately, and who never expects us to injure <HI>our&s;elves on any &s;core whatever.</HI>&mdash;Would <HI>He</HI> have me li&s;ten to that which &s;ounds &s;o like the trick of a needy traveller, and &s;hall I credulou&s;ly give my &s;taff from my hand in expectation of another dropping down from Hea|ven?&mdash;No&mdash;friend&mdash;I under&s;tand &s;omething of this world; and though I admire to <HI>do good,</HI> I mu&s;t not expo&s;e my&s;elf to <HI>ridicule</HI>&mdash;for if I was to comply with your re|que&s;t,
<PB N="124" REF="127">tell me hone&s;tly would&s;t thou not laugh at my weakne&s;s? Farwell then, and be a&s;&s;ured, I lament my inability as much as thou lamente&s;t thy nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn what a very cautious woman <HI>might</HI> have &s;aid: let us now &s;ee what <HI>was</HI> really the &s;entiment of the occa&s;ion. There is no other an&s;wer recorded than that &s;he <HI>did</HI> according to the de&s;ire of Elijah. She did not even &s;tay to expatiate upon her <HI>own genero&s;ity</HI> &mdash;nor tell him, that if his pro|phecy &s;hould be <HI>unfulfilled,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t only &s;tarve &s;o much the &s;ooner for her good nature; but,
<PB N="125" REF="128">&s;he relied &s;o implicity on his &s;in|cerity, and obeyed &s;o willingly the in&s;pired impul&s;e of benevo|lence, that &s;he ha&s;ted to make a little cake for Elijah <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and then attended to the wants of her little one and her&s;elf. But this courte&s;y and confidence was pre|ternaturally rewarded: for &s;he and he, <HI>and her hou&s;e,</HI> eat many days; <Q>and the barrel of meal wa&s;ted not, nor did the cru&s;e of oil fail.</Q></P>
<P>Elijah now became a lodger in the widow's hou&s;e, and was con&s;i|dered as a part of her family, till a &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tance fell out,
<PB N="126" REF="129">which gave her at fir&s;t but too much rea&s;on to alter her opinion of him. Soon after this friend|&s;hip was formed between them, the &s;on of the ho&s;te&s;s fell &s;ick, and his &s;ickne&s;s was of &s;o &s;ore a nature, that it pre&s;ently terminat|ed in his death. The unhappy mother attributed it to &s;ome &s;ecret exertion of cruel power in Elijah; for as he could divine <HI>one</HI> miracle in her favour, &s;o &s;he apprehended he might be able to effect <HI>ano|ther</HI> to her prejudice: However, certain it is, &s;he entertained ideas exceedingly to his di&s;credit, and indeed, e&s;teemed the thing &s;o very ungrateful a return for her fair
<PB N="127" REF="130">conduct and demeanour, that we find her reproaching him with all the &s;everity of an ill-intreated friend, and all the di&s;traction of an injured parent. <Q>What have I do with thee&mdash;thou man of God! art thou come unto me, to call my &s;in to my remembrance, and to &s;lay my &s;on?</Q> This appears to have been &s;poken with the utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s of <HI>irony,</HI> as if &s;he had &s;aid:&mdash;Thou man, who pretend|ed&s;t to have been directed hi|ther by the expre&s;s orders of God: &mdash;Thou me&s;&s;enger from the Lord of Heaven&mdash;what have I done unto thee, that thou &s;houlde&s;t thus requite me?&mdash;Do&s;t thou do this

Her mi&s;ery too, had its &s;ource &s;o near the &s;oul, that he could not attempt either to check or to chide it; ad|vice would have been rejected, and pity impertinent: he troubled her with neither; but taking the baby corp&s;e out of the mother's bo&s;om, where (though it was dead) &s;he was &s;till care&s;&s;ing and &s;till crad|ling

<P>And now being at liberty to ad|dre&s;s the God who had &s;o often, and &s;o miraculou&s;ly befriended and indulged, and honoured him, he broke out into the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;upplication. <Q>Oh Lord my God, my God, ha&s;t thou brought evil upon the widow with whom I &s;ojourn, by &s;lay|ing her &s;on?

Were words ever calculated to ex|pre&s;s &s;uch a &s;troke of tran&s;port? it mu&s;t have been a bli&s;s which trod hard upon the very heels of agony. Parents may, perhaps, paint it to them&s;elves: they may &s;ee (through the mirror of a &s;ympa|thetic fancy) the poor widow re|ceiving her child from the healing

The prophet, indeed, &s;aid lit|tle; for language was unnece&s;&s;ary; the thing &s;poke for it&s;elf, the lovely eye was again gently opened on the light, the dimple re&s;umed its re&s;idence, and all its little &s;en|&s;ibilities were fully re&s;tored.

<P>PASSAGE.</P>
<Q>AND JUDAH AND ISRAEL DWELT SAFELY, EVERY MAN, UNDER HIS VINE, AND UN|DER HIS FIG-TREE, FROM DAN, EVEN TO BEER-SHEBA, ALL THE DAYS OF SOLOMON.</Q>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, as much moral &s;en&s;e, and literary beau|ty, compri&s;ed in this pa&s;&s;age, as ever was conveyed to the human under&s;tanding, by the hand of tra|dition. What a paradi&s;aical pic|ture does it give us of the reign

<P>The very fir&s;t in&s;tance of his wi&s;|dom, gave to mankind the mo&s;t delightful earne&s;t of what might be expected from him. I &s;peak of his judgment betwixt the two harlots. How finely did he di&s;|tingui&s;h the &s;implicity of natural &s;orrow, from the whineing com|plaint of adventitious woe: he &s;aw the real parent, in her fears, her wi&s;hes, and her tears; and he de|tected
<PB N="137" REF="140">the impo&s;ture, by every ac|tion. The beginning of the reign exhibits this illu&s;trious heir of the noble David in all the glory of &s;ublunary greatne&s;s; <Q>For he had dominion over all the region, on this &s;ide the river, from Tiph&s;hah, even to Azzah, over all the kings on this &s;ide the river:</Q> and in the mid&s;t of &s;o exten&s;ive an authority, he main|tained peace on all &s;ides around him: <Q>Every man dwelt &s;afely under his vine, and under his fig-tree,</Q> from one end of his realms to the other, <Q>from Dan even to Beer-&s;heba.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141">
What a pro&s;pect was here for the people! What a joyful pro|mi&s;e for the public heart! But with what energy&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid&mdash;enchantment&mdash;is the di&s;po|&s;ition of this prince characterized in the &s;ub&s;equent ver&s;e?</P>
<P><Q>And God gave Solomon wi&s;|dom and under&s;tanding, ex|ceeding much, and <HI>largene&s;s of heart,</HI> even as the &s;and that is on the &s;ea-&s;hore.</Q></P>
<P>He had, it &s;eems, not only the greate&s;t wealth, but the nice&s;t judg|ment, and the noble&s;t inclination, to di&s;tribute that wealth, to make
<PB N="139" REF="142">it conducive to general felicity. He equalled his father in his poe|tical capacity, and even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him as a morali&s;t: his &s;ongs are marked by an enthu&s;ia&s;m, a ten|derne&s;s, and a pathos, in which all the trea&s;ures of the warme&s;t, gaye&s;t, and &s;ublime&s;t imagination, appear to have been exhau&s;ted. Image and metaphor were equally at his command; and a genius, &s;o etherial, is &s;ometimes di&s;covered in the&s;e &s;allies of his pen, that his conception takes a flight too lofty for the <HI>eye</HI> to <HI>reach</HI> him. But, how|ever amazing the powers of his <HI>fancy,</HI> they were, at lea&s;t, equalled by the graver abilities of his <HI>judg|ment.</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="143">He, by no means, figured le&s;s as a moral writer: for, his Proverbs are a collection of con|ci&s;e maxims, which &s;tand, altoge|ther unrivalled; and are the foun|dation of all tho&s;e &s;hort, multitu|dinous remarks, which have been i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s, &s;ince his time: but tho&s;e of Solomon will, indeed, be ever &s;eparated from all others. Such knowledge of life, &s;uch va|rious beauty in the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash; &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing ter&s;ene&s;s in the &s;tyle&mdash;&s;uch poignancy in the &s;a|tire&mdash;&s;uch purity in the phra&s;e, and &s;uch &s;olidity in the &s;en&s;e, <HI>en|titled</HI> their author to the immorta|lity
<PB N="141" REF="144">which he claims, and which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to have been a epocha in his genius: his compo|&s;itions pre&s;ent us with a climax. From the Poet, he ri&s;es to the Mo|rali&s;t, and from the Morali&s;t he &s;oars to the Divine. The book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, is one of the fine&s;t &s;y&s;tems, or bodies of divinity. Every &s;entence is &s;ound and ortho|dox. His ob&s;ervations are accu|rate and devotional; and the whole book well becomes the preacher and the pulpit. In a word, Solo|mon was the greate&s;t and mo&s;t ge|neral literary character that ever
<PB N="142" REF="145">wrote. As a prince, he was amia|ble, beloved, and popular; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to give a more plea&s;|ing a&s;&s;urance of it, than the paci|fic and tranquil idea &s;ugge&s;ted by the text: <Q>Every man dwelt in &s;afety under his own vine and fig-tree, even <HI>all</HI> the days of Solomon.</Q> It is &s;omewhat painful to view him in a religious light. Ah, Solomon, thou wi&s;e&s;t of the wi&s;e&mdash;how could&s;t thou, at any time, forget the power who had dealt by thee in &s;o liberal a manner? eminent alike, in intel|lect, and in magnificence, how could&s;t thou &s;o &s;tain thy annals, as to turn a&s;ide from the author of
<PB N="143" REF="146">all thy greatne&s;s? How could&s;t thou &s;o di&s;grace&mdash;&s;o pro&s;titute the &s;plendour of that temple which thou had&s;t reared and dedicated to the true God, to the dreams and weakne&s;&s;es of idolatry? What, alas, could the vi&s;ionary godde&s;s of the Zidonians do for thee? What could Molech, or A&s;htoreth, that de&s;erved thy devotion, or &s;acri|fices? Could they in&s;pire thee with intelligence above all others, and &s;tore thy mind with all the or|naments of ta&s;te and &s;cience, and elegance and joy?</P>
<P>One apology, however, not a little mitigating, pre&s;ents it&s;elf.
<PB N="144" REF="147">He did not yield to this infatua|tion till he was in the decline of life&mdash;po&s;&s;ibly, when his faculties were &s;omewhat impaired&mdash;and when the ill advice of tho&s;e who were about him, e&s;pecially his eoncubines, teazed him into er|ror. The power of a bad woman, who has any hold upon the heart, is unlimited, and will generally render pliable to its purpo&s;es, not only the fine&s;t head, but the fine&s;t heart: and it mu&s;t be al&s;o remem|bered, that the &s;trength of the ten|der pa&s;&s;ions is always in proportion to the &s;trength of the genius; &s;o that Soloman might be led, as it were, captive, in the bonds of
<PB N="145" REF="148">love, and &s;acrifice to Chemo&s;h, not becau&s;e he venerated that ima|ginary deity, but to avoid the per|&s;ecution of the female party, which was formed again&s;t his religious in|tegrity. At all events, let us not be too rigid, to degrade &s;o great a character. It is well known, that the wi&s;e&s;t men, are the mo&s;t fre|quently &s;educed into the <HI>weake&s;t tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> With all his &s;agacity, Solomon was a human creature.

<HEAD>On SCRIPTURAL SUBLIMITY, and BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>PASSAGE.</P>

<P>THE elegant Mr. Burke

But I cannot agree with him in thinking <HI>that</HI> &s;ublimity ari&s;es from a profu&s;ion of tho&s;e images in which the mind is &s;o dazzled as to make it impo&s;&s;ible to attend to that exact coherence and agree|ment of the allu&s;ions, which we &s;hould require on every other oc|ca&s;ion. With due deference to
<PB N="149" REF="151">Mr. Burke, I will venture to &s;ay, that, <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the allu&s;ions <HI>are</HI> exact, and coherent. The proof is be|fore us. Read the whole de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P><Q>How was he honoured in the mid&s;t of the people, in his com|ing out of the &s;anctuary! He was as the morning &s;tar in the mid&s;t of a cloud, and as the moon at the full: as the &s;un &s;hining upon the temple of the Mo&s;t High, and as the rain|bow giveth light in the bright clouds: and as the flower of ro&s;es in the &s;pring of the year: as lilies by the rivers of waters,
<PB N="150" REF="152">and as the frankincen&s;e-tree in &s;ummer; as fire and incen&s;e in the cen&s;er; and as a ve&s;&s;el of gold &s;et with precious &s;tones; as a fair olive-tree budding forth fruit; and as a cypre&s;s which groweth up to the clouds.&mdash; When he put on the robe of honour, and was cloathed with the perfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made the garment of holine&s;s honourable. He him&s;elf &s;tood by the hearth of the altar com|pa&s;&s;ed with his brethren round about, as a young cedar in Li|banus, and as palm-trees com|pa&s;&s;ed they him about. So
<PB N="151" REF="153">were all the &s;ons of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>It was the intention of the &s;on of Sirach, in the&s;e &s;entences, to &s;et forth his object with all the ad|vantages of language. Poetry and oratory were equally &s;olicited to animate and to adorn the portrait of the prie&s;t: in con&s;equence of which, he is attended from the &s;anctuary to the altar, by all the images and in&s;truments of the Sub|lime and Beautiful. Behold him thus &s;urrounded&mdash;examine the whole &s;cene as it pa&s;&s;es before your eye, and you will pronounce it
<PB N="152" REF="154">uniformly admirable. He is de|&s;cribed as coming out of the &s;anc|tuary amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. The word <HI>honoured,</HI> is a mo&s;t dignified addition to the greatne&s;s of his character&mdash;Let us, for a moment, leave out this &s;in|gle word, and &s;ee how the idea dimini&s;hes: <Q>He was in the mid&s;t of the people in his coming out of the &s;anctuary.</Q> How poor! Re&s;tore to the &s;entence its full compliment, and the de&s;ign of the writer, as well as the excellence of the object, is complete. <Q>He was <HI>honoured</HI> in the very mid&s;t of the people.</Q> The next allu|&s;ion carries him higher &s;till. <Q>He
<PB N="153" REF="155">was as the morning &s;tar in the mid&s;t of a cloud.</Q> No &s;ooner was he out of the &s;anctuary, than his noble and maje&s;tic figure was di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t of the multitude, <Q>as the morning &s;tar in the mid&s;t of a cloud.</Q> The allu&s;ion to the <HI>cloud,</HI> hath al&s;o the advantage of a double <HI>propriety,</HI> being, in a metaphorical &s;en&s;e, aptly de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the thickne&s;s, and du&s;ky appearance of the admiring multitude. Some of the &s;ucceeding allu&s;ions were admitted to give the high prie&s;t the qualities of <HI>amiablene&s;s,</HI> as well as <HI>grandeur.</HI> <Q>He was as the <HI>flower</HI> of ro&s;es in the <HI>&s;pring</HI> of

Not &s;o the &s;on of Sirach. He painted the &s;on of Onias with more exqui|&s;ite colouring&mdash;he drew him with
<PB N="155" REF="157">a more ma&s;terly pencil. The ro&s;es to which he was compared, were the ro&s;es of the <HI>&s;pring,</HI> a &s;ea&s;on of the year when tho&s;e flowers are more particularly &s;weet and cap|tivating&mdash;the lilies, which, in a fugurative &s;en&s;e, re&s;embled him, were tho&s;e which derived more ele|gance from their &s;ituation by the <HI>rivers of waters,</HI> and, whatever perfumes belong to the frankin|cen&s;e-tree, our poet pre&s;ented it to us, in the pride of <HI>&s;ummer,</HI> when its beauties would naturally be in blo&s;&s;om. Be&s;ides this, there ap|pears a coherence in the&s;e allu|&s;ions, which may e&s;cape us at fir&s;t. They &s;eem to aim at the di&s;play
<PB N="156" REF="158">of the <HI>moral</HI> character of the high prie&s;t. "A good name," &s;ays the &s;cripture, "&s;melleth <HI>&s;weet.</HI>" How proper, therefore, is Simon com|pared to the fragrance of ro&s;es, and other odoriferous &s;hrubs. Li|lies have ever been emblematic of innocence, and purity. The <HI>agree|ment</HI> of the allu&s;ion is, therefore, exact here al&s;o. Thus might I proceed to ob&s;erve the moral as well as de&s;criptive propriety of comparing him with the re&s;t. But it is wholly unnece&s;&s;ary.

<P><Q>O Lord my God thou art very great, thou art cloathed with honour and maje&s;ty: who covere&s;t thy&s;elf with light as with a garment: who &s;tretche&s;t out the Heavens like a curtain: who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Thou covered&s;t it with the deep as with a gar|ment: the waters &s;tood above
<PB N="164" REF="166">the mountains&mdash;at thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they ha&s;ted away.</Q>&mdash; What inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ublimity in every one of the&s;e thoughts, and with how much accuracy the dic|tion is adapted to di&s;play them! What ideas can exceed tho&s;e of the Deity's covering him&s;elf in a mantle of light, mounting his cloudy chariot, and walking on the wings of the wind?</P>
<P>The <HI>a&s;cending &s;eries,</HI> is in this pa&s;&s;age, very judiciou&s;ly pre&s;erv|ed; the whole &s;entiment is a glo|rious gradation from <HI>great,</HI> to greater, and from that to the la&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="167">po&s;itive degree of the climax. I beg the reader to mark the ri&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ions as he repeats them. There is al&s;o a parti|cular beauty here, in the &s;udden tran&s;ition from one per&s;on to ano|ther&mdash;<Q><HI>Who</HI> walketh upon the wings of the wind;</Q> and then in&s;tantly altering the addre&s;s to&mdash;<Q><HI>Thou</HI> covered&s;t it with a deep as with a garment.</Q></P>
<P>But a &s;econd example courts our admiration, and that of &s;o high and exalted a nature, that a reader of true ta&s;te, and a real &s;en&s;e of religion, will hardly bear to engage his time in looking at
<PB N="166" REF="168">minor or modern authors; while <HI>&s;ome,</HI> probably, who have been prejudiced again&s;t the Bible, will be &s;urprized to find &s;uch admira|ble, and unequalled writing in a book, which they have been taught to con&s;ider as a dull, unintere&s;ting code of maxims, proverbs, and ordinary &s;entiments.</P>
<P><Q>Whither &s;hall I go from thy &s;pirit? Or whither &s;hall I flee from thy pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Hell, be|hold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermo&s;t parts of
<PB N="167" REF="169">the &s;ea: even there &s;hall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand &s;hall hold me. If I &s;ay, &s;urely the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover me, even the night &s;hall be light about me. Yea, the darkne&s;s hideth not from thee; but the night &s;hineth as the day: the darkne&s;s and the light are both alike to thee.</Q> In &s;hort, this, and various other portions of the &s;a|cred books, as infinitely exceed Homer, as Homer &s;urpa&s;&s;es Black|more. There is a ver&s;e or two u&s;ed in the burial of the dead (than which there never was a &s;ublimer, more &s;erious, or more &s;uitable ceremony). O&s;&s;ian hath
<PB N="168" REF="170">al&s;o touched the &s;ame &s;ubject, but the &s;acred writer hath ten times the &s;implicity, and is abundantly more correct in the metaphors; be&s;ides that, the allu&s;ions are truer to nature and familiar life.</P>
<P><Q>A thou&s;and years in thy fight, O Lord, are but as ye&s;terday: &s;eeing that is pa&s;t as a watch in the night. As &s;oon as thou &s;cattere&s;t them, they are even as a &s;leep, and fade away &s;uddenly, like the gra&s;s. In the morn|ing it is green and groweth up; but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171">
Were we to run the parallel be|tween this pa&s;&s;age and that quoted from O&s;&s;ian, the inferiority of the latter would, perhaps, not be very agreeable to the admirers of that picture&s;que bard. To &s;peak im|partially, it is &s;carcely giving any profane writers, however popular, fair play, in comparing them with tho&s;e Sublime, Beautiful, and Pa|thetic compo&s;itions, which are the objects of the pre&s;ent volumes: on the other hand, tho&s;e compo&s;itions them&s;elves, have &s;o &s;eldom fair play &s;hewn to <HI>them,</HI> while many flim&s;y, frivolous, or bomba&s;tic per|formances, run away with the huzza of the multitude, that hav|ing
<PB N="170" REF="172">had the la&s;h of ju&s;tice in hand, it was but right to u&s;e it a little; e&s;pecially as it formed an impor|tant part of my &s;ubject, to vindi|cate the Scriptures from negli|gence, and to hold them up as the patterns of purity, per&s;picuity, and all the &s;ources of the <HI>true Sub|lime.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ources branch out, ac|cording to Longinus, into the fol|lowing divi&s;ions:</P>
<Q><P N="1">I. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t excel|lent of the&s;e is a boldne&s;s and grandeur in the <HI>thoughts.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="171" REF="173">
II. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> is called the <HI>Pathetic,</HI> or the power of rai&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions to a violent and even enthu&s;ia&s;tic degree; and the&s;e two being genuine con|&s;tituents of the <HI>Sublime,</HI> are the gifts of nature, whereas the other &s;orts depend in &s;ome mea|&s;ure upon art.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>third</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;kilful application of <HI>figures,</HI> which are twofold, of &s;entiment and language.</P>
<P>IV. The <HI>fourth</HI> is a noble and graceful manner of <HI>expre&s;|&s;ion,</HI> which is not only to choo&s;e
<PB N="172" REF="174">out &s;ignificant and elegant words, but al&s;o to adorn and embelli&s;h the &s;tyle, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>tropes.</HI></P>
<P N="4">V. The <HI>fifth</HI> &s;ource of the <HI>Sublime,</HI> which completes all the preceding, is the <HI>&s;tructure</HI> or compo&s;ition of all the pe|riods, in all po&s;&s;ible dignity and grandeur.</P></Q>
<P>It hath been my endeavour in this work, to <HI>try</HI> certain pa&s;&s;ages in the SACRED WRITINGS, by the te&s;t of Longinus's principles. I &s;hall account my&s;elf &s;ingularly for|tunate if &s;uch endeavours have, in
<PB N="173" REF="175">any degree, done a &s;ervice to com|po&s;itions, which are &s;o able to &s;up|port the trial; but who&s;e beau|ties and &s;ublimities, though thickly &s;cattered through almo&s;t every page, are &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, or mi&s;under&s;tood, merely, it is feared, becau&s;e they are of a devo|tional, as well as of a poetical na|ture.</P>
