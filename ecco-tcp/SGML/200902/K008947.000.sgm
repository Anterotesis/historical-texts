<L>A peal of prai&s;e has thunder'd all around,</L>
<L>And every hand employ'd its utmo&s;t pains,</L>
<L>To clap the mighty merit of the chains.</L>
</LG>

<L>WHEN things, like the&s;e, for ever give offence,</L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y">
When men throw nature negligently by,</L>
<L>And judge not from the feelings, but the eye;</L>

<L>From the warm &s;cene may &s;candalou&s;ly run,</L>

<L>With pitying warmth intuitively &s;tole,</L>

Therefore, unlike &s;ome brothers of the pen,</L>
<L>Who judg'd of actors as they judg'd of men,</L>

<L>LONG in the annals of theatric fame,</L>

<L>Either in mirth to laugh us to exce&s;s,</L>
<L>Or, where he weeps, to load us with di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;</L>
<L>Nor is it &s;trange, that e'en in partial days,</L>
<L>He gains &s;o high an eminence of prai&s;e;</L>

<L>Than ever centred in one mind before:</L>
<L>Say, if we &s;earch, minutely, from the age</L>
<L>In which old THESPIS fir&s;t began the &s;tage,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7">
And range thro' all the celebrated climes,</L>
<L>In which it flouri&s;h'd, to the pre&s;ent times,</L>
<L>Where &s;hall we find an actor who has pre&s;t,</L>

<L>Unmatch'd, alike, in laughter or in tears?</L>

<L>Whom fame extoll'd as prodigies of power,</L>
<L>Have yet to &s;canty limits been confin'd,</L>
<L>And &s;hewn but one dull tendency of mind;</L>

YET, tho' thus warm I freely pour my thoughts,</L>

<L><PB N="8" REF="9">
But when, even Shake&s;pear never cou'd po&s;&s;e&s;s</L>

<L>A nice affected drawlingne&s;s of phra&s;e,</L>
<L>A wire-drawn tone in every thing he plays;</L>
<L>With which, too oft, mo&s;t execrably fine,</L>
<L>He racks a word, and tortures out a line;</L>

<L>THE greate&s;t charge our little judges lay</L>
<L>When HOLLAND'S worth they critically weigh,</L>
<L>Is, that in all the characters he tries,</L>

<L>That meanly &s;ervile in his walk of parts,</L>

<L>And lick the foot that tramples it in du&s;t.</L>
<L>Yet, &s;ure, if GARRICK hitherto has ran</L>

<L>On that exalted principle of art,</L>
<L>Which knocks with truth's bold hand again&s;t the heart;</L>

<L>The genuine form of nature he conveys,</L>

<L>When HOLLAND &s;eeks his ve&s;tiges to tread,</L>
