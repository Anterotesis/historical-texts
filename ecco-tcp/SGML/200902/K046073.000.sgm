<HEAD>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE veneration I bear to the memory of Doctor Gold&s;mith, has drawn me into the pre&s;ent publication; and the &s;entiments of affection to be found in his Dedication of the DESERTED VILLAGE, have induced me to in&s;cribe <HI>this</HI> Elegy to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds; who will naturally receive with kindne&s;s whatever is de&s;igned, as a te&s;timony of ju&s;tice, to a Friend that is no more.</P>
<P>In contemplating the death of this excellent man, and admirable poet, I have been led to contemplate likewi&s;e the fate of others; for within a very few years our literary lo&s;&s;es have been fatally multiplied, and many of the mo&s;t valuable members have been &s;uddenly lopped off from &s;cience and &s;ociety. In pur&s;uit of this undertaking, where the &s;ame pathetic &s;ubject was to be considered to the end, I re&s;olved to &s;et out upon an irregular principle, that without enchaining my&s;elf to any critical uniformity, I might have &s;cope and latitude for whatever varieties of ver&s;i|fication &s;hould fall in my way.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">As I was to deplore the lo&s;s of different writers, each of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very &s;trongly a marking origi|nality, I thought it be&s;t to write a &s;ort of Epitaph upon each: accordingly, the following Ver&s;es are intended as &s;o many &s;eparate Imitations of the &s;tyle and manner of the Authors which they comme|morate.</P>
<P>That the occa&s;ion which produced the Elegy, might not lo&s;e the &s;trength of the impre&s;&s;ion, by delay&mdash;for alas, the traces of &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of the learned, are &s;oon worn out by the tumults of life&mdash;I hurried the compo&s;ition to the pre&s;s, the moment I could withdraw my hand from the manu&s;cript; the whole of which was begun and fini&s;hed within a few hours after the news reached me, that Dr. Gold&s;mith was dead.</P>
<P>But I beg, Sir, you will excu&s;e the length of this Addre&s;s, and believe me to be</P>

<Q>Nor, in lamenting the havock, which Death hath triumphantly made (continued GENIUS) in the letter'd generation, can HAWKESWORTH, be forgotten: A name which is particularly endear'd to me, by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to &s;cience.
<PB N="31" REF="29">
Every &s;troke of his pen, corre&s;ponding with every idea of his mind, however playful, or however pa|thetic, always terminated in the mo&s;t u&s;eful know|ledge: that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life, or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration. The ardour which uniformly animated his endeavours, gave con&s;tant vigour to his thought, activity to his powers, and dignity to his &s;entiment: Nor did his excellence ari&s;e &s;o much from the ambition which panted after fame, and aim'd at popularity&mdash;which appeal'd to the acclamations of the mob, or &s;ought the di&s;tinctions of this world; as from the hearty hope of contributing, in whatever degree, to the inve&s;tigation of truth, the amendment of man|ners, and the rectitude of the mind. Of tho&s;e who have acquir'd a literary immortality, there are few who could di&s;pute with my HAWKESWORTH, &s;trength of &s;en&s;e, or elevation of expre&s;&s;ion; and &s;till fewer have given to the world &s;o valuable, or &s;o copious a fund of virtuous entertainment. Amid&s;t all the efforts of his intellect, whether his in&s;tructions were prepared in the dre&s;s of hi&s;tory &mdash; or convey'd in the vehicle of fabulous narration&mdash;whether they a&s;&s;um'd the graver &s;tyle of argumentative profundity, or whether they adopted the &s;till deeper re&s;earches of philo&s;ophical raciocination; &mdash;their con&s;tant greatne&s;s of de&s;ign was equally appa|rent,

and the promotion of virtue was always &s;trongly mark'd in the language of the writer. My dear, my re|gretted HAWKESWORTH, was indeed never long &s;educ'd by any temptations, or ab&s;tracted by any &s;cientific allurements, from tho&s;e views which are alone of in|trin&s;ic importance, and which he well knew, would retain that importance, when all, that now flutters to the fancy, plays upon the pa&s;&s;ions, and fa&s;cinates the heart, &s;hall confe&s;s their in&s;ignificance, and fly like the atom, that is driven before the tempe&s;t.</Q>

<L>The peering morn&mdash;the dun-di&s;colour'd clouds,</L>
