<P>_IT has for a long Time been an Objection to the Writer of Periodical E&s;&s;ays, that every Subject is pre-occupied, that the <HI>Spectator,</HI> the <HI>Tatler,</HI> and the <HI>Guardian</HI> have culti|vated every Field of Reflection, and that there remains nothing at pre&s;ent to be gleaned by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Adven|turers. Though I have all the Re&s;pect due to the Me|mory of the excellent Writers of the Performances ju&s;t mentioned, I am far from paying them a blind Adora|tion; on the contrary, amid&s;t all that &s;urprizing Ema|nation of Genius, Wit, and Humour, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes many of their Writings, I can &s;ometimes de&s;cry a Subject carele&s;ly treated, without any of their u&s;ual Turns of Sentiment, or Beauties of Diction. I
<PB N="2" REF="5">have now and then gone through a Series of important Trifles, and I have occa&s;ionally found them vague upon Subjects of Critici&s;m, indeterminate in their Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and loo&s;e in their Definitions. If this hap|pens to be the Ca&s;e, would it not be an erroneous Pro|ceeding to &s;uppre&s;s every other Attempt, becau&s;e Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> planned &s;o many Years before? Nay, even if they were free from any of tho&s;e Blemi&s;hes, which ari&s;e either from Inadvertence or the Imbecillity of hu|man Nature, would it not be ab&s;urd to extingui&s;h the Seeds of laudable Emulation? Had the Rigour of this Sentence been carried into Execution, the World would never have been favoured with the admirable Perfor|mances of the Author of the <HI>Rambler.</HI> That the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Language has received from this Writer many ad|ditional Ornaments, it is, I believe, univer&s;ally felt by all Men of Ta&s;te. Every Topic is by him treated with great Erudition and &s;trong Sen&s;e, enlivened with all the glowing Colourings of a warm Imagination, and the whole carried on with a nervous, clear, and har|monious Stile. If the Performance in general has not the Variety of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> it is becau&s;e Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> wrote &s;ingly and alone, whereas the former was &s;upported by &s;everal of eminent Abilities, and there|fore, in the pre&s;ent Age there &s;eems nothing want|ing but a Coalition of Men of Parts to equal our Predece&s;&s;ors in all Manner of Periodical Writings.</P>
<P>Certain it is, there are many Topics in every branch of Science and in all the liberal Arts, which may &s;till receive new Lights, and conduce both to the Enter|tainment and In&s;truction of the Public. Since Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Time, a <HI>Du Bos</HI> has &s;hone forth in <HI>France,</HI> and a <HI>Spence</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and the late ingenious Editor of a Tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil</HI> is a convincing Proof that Rules for fine Writing, and Precepts of critical Knowledge may be &s;till enforced with great Elegance and Pro|priety, though the E&s;&s;ays on <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="6">on the <HI>Plea&s;ures of Imagination,</HI> mu&s;t be allowed to have all the ma&s;terly Strokes, that can re&s;ult from a delicate and refined Ta&s;te. The Regions of Reflection are like a Champain Country, in which different Objects pre&s;ent them&s;elves in various Attitudes to the Eye, and the Imagination is frequently caught by Parts of the Pro&s;pect, which have e&s;caped another's Ob&s;ervation, each Per&s;on receiving different Sen&s;ations, according as the Fancy is di&s;po&s;ed for the Sublime, the Wonderful, or the Beautiful in the natural World.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; the continual Fluctuation of Fa&s;hions, Cu&s;|toms and Manners mu&s;t always afford fre&s;h Matter for the Satyri&s;t of Wit and Humour. The Tree of Folly is like the Tree mentioned by the Author of my Motto; though many have plucked a Branch from it, it is always quickly replaced by another, and the new Growth &s;hoots into Day-light with undimini&s;hed Fertility.</P>
<P>Are there tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed to indulge a delicate Vein of Raillery on the Foibles and Piccadillos of the Fair? Never was there more ample room to di&s;play a Turn of Wit, in this Way, than what the pre&s;ent Times are &s;o happy as to afford. The Hoop has of late &s;welled to a wider Circumference than ever, and by the Help of a few formidable Rows of Steel, threatens Mi&s;chief to the whole Circle of Beaux, who cannot now approach the Ladies in their Entrenchments, with|out manife&s;t Danger of fracturing a Shin-bone, hurting the Pan of the Knee, or &s;ome &s;uch Di&s;a&s;ter While this Fa&s;hion prevails, the Ladies may be charged with carrying concealed Arms, and making U&s;e of ma&s;ked Barteries; for which, by the Way, they have no manner of Occa&s;ion as they &s;eem at pre&s;ent to be in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more Courage than any <HI>Amazon</HI> mentioned in Hi|&s;tory. For whereas tho&s;e Viragos u&s;ed to encounter with ONLY ONE BREAST EXERTED, the modern La|dies are not afraid of meeting the Men with both quite naked and di&s;played to View. The Head is al&s;o
<PB N="4" REF="7">built up many Stories higher than it u&s;ed to be, and the Art of Painting is now arrived to &s;uch Perfection, that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to know a female Ac|quaintance for any length of Time, each lovely Fair having as many Faces and Complexions, as Gloves, Fans or Tippets. Add to this, that you may meet a Lady To-day with an elegant Shape, fine by Degrees and delicately le&s;s, and To-morrow &s;he will appear as big round the Wai&s;t, as if within a few Days of her Time. Be&s;ides this, <HI>Cribbidge</HI> has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Reign of Love, and <HI>Cupid</HI> minds nothing now but cogging the Dice, or procuring a Pair-Royal at Brag; and in|deed the pre&s;ent happy Di&s;po&s;ition for Luxury, and every Vice, Folly, Whim, Foible, Humour and Ex|travagance &s;eems to promi&s;e a very plentiful Crop every Year, &s;o that after a Survey of this Metropolis, we may &s;ay with Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> in his Prologue to the tender Hu&s;|band, <Q>Here's &s;till Encouragement for tho&s;e that write.</Q></P>
<P>On this Account, though I have now felt the Anxiety of a Writer for twelve Months pa&s;t, I have re&s;olved with my&s;elf not to lay down my Pen, until I am warned to do it by the La&s;&s;itude of an Author, or, what is wor&s;e, the La&s;&s;itude of the Reader. At pre&s;ent however I do not find any Symptoms of this Sort in my own Brea&s;t, nor can I learn that my Paper declines with my Readers. In my Rambles &s;ince la&s;t <HI>Saturday,</HI> I did not meet with any Thing that made again&s;t me. At <HI>Sam</HI>'s Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> informed me, that, his Cu&s;tomers hope I am not going to leave off Trade. A Stationer at the <HI>Chapter</HI> Coffee|hou&s;e in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Church-yard,</HI> call'd with &s;ome Earne&s;t|ne&s;s for the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> and having Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it, he moi&s;tened a Corner of it with the Tip of his Tongue, and then holding it up to the Light "really, &s;ays he, its <HI>a very good Paper."</HI> At mo&s;t Places in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet, Joe Clare</HI> with a Pinch of Snuff between his Fingers and the u&s;ual Flouri&s;h of his Arm
<PB N="5" REF="8">declared highly in my Favour. At the <HI>Bedford</HI> I could gue&s;s from &s;ome Whi&s;pers, which I ca&s;ually overheard, that I am as &s;triking a Character as ever. <Q>Hu&s;h&mdash;that's he&mdash;that's <HI>Ranger</HI></Q>&mdash;"was you ever in Company with him!"&mdash;<Q>No,&mdash;I &s;hould like to &s;pend an Evening with him</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;In the &s;ofter Climate of St. <HI>James</HI>'s Air, I was told, that my Bays are likely to flouri&s;h, and I was particularly a&s;&s;ured, by a Gentleman who frequents the <HI>Cocoa tree</HI> in <HI>Pallmall,</HI> that <HI>Ranger</HI> has gained Ad|mittance there notwith&s;tanding their Attachment to the ADVENTORER.</P>
<P>Things &s;tanding thus, I am determined to per&s;evere in my Undertaking, and I therefore take this Opportu|nity to renew my Application to all the Gentlemen, Clergy, and Freeholders of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In my fir&s;t Number I declared my&s;elf a Candidate for their Fa|vour, and I beg a Continuance of their Votes and In|tere&s;t, until cogent Rea&s;o is &s;hall incline me to with|draw my&s;elf from their Service &mdash;</P>

<P>IT is with great Plea&s;ure, that I begin to &s;cent the Winter Air, as I am informed by a very &s;en&s;ible Book&s;eller that an <HI>R,</HI> in the Month is not only good for Oy&s;ters, but al&s;o Writers of all Denominations. The Sea&s;on is now opening, when all the Vices and Follies of this Metropolis will be carried on with fre&s;h Alacrity, which will undoubtedly afford Variety of In|telligence from all Quarters, to collect which I &s;hall not &s;pare either Trouble or Expence, though it mu&s;t be al|lowed that a One-Hor&s;e Chai&s;e during the Summer-Sea&s;on, and Two-pence to be paid at the Bar of every Coffee-hou&s;e mu&s;t in the End amount to a con&s;ider|able Sum.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_I Have in a former Paper delivered my Sen|timents concerning the notable Art of Humbugging; I &s;hall this Day throw to|gether &s;ome cur&s;ory Reflections upon the Practice of Raillery, which, in my Opinion, it is the Intere&s;t of Society to explode from every Company.</P>
<P>I am induced into this Way of thinking from an Ob|&s;ervation, that few People are properly qualified to exerci&s;e this Talent, there being hardly any Thing which requires &s;o fine an Under&s;tanding, together with &s;o much Delicacy in the Exertion of it. But as Matters are generally managed, there is nothing &s;o coar&s;e as the Attempts of tho&s;e, who are ambitious of &s;hining in Conver&s;ation, and are therefore determined to banter Mankind into an exalted Opinion of their Accompli&s;h|ments. The utmo&s;t that can be allowed to the&s;e Gen|tlemen, is to join in the general Laugh; and, if Mirth &s;hould be going forward, they may very properly be admitted to partake of the frolic Fe&s;tivity, without vain|ly pretending to take the Lead, or to engro&s;s the Con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="8" REF="11">into their own Hands; in like Manner as the uninformed Country Squire &s;hould not be &s;uffered by the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies in a polite A&s;&s;embly, to come forward in a Minuet, where the Graces of Move|ment are required, though he may be tolerated to romp in a Country Dance, and di&s;play all the Gambols of his unfa&s;hioned Agility.
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; Nec cum &s;is caetera fo&s;&s;or</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tres tantum ad numeros Satyri moveare Bathylli.</HI></L></Q> Were I to define Raillery, I &s;hould call it a delicate Exertion of Plea&s;antry upon the Foibles or the &s;light Inadvertences, which di&s;clo&s;e them&s;elves in the Actions of Men. From this View of Matters, it will appear, that no Tincture of Ill-nature mu&s;t be &s;uffered to disfigure the Surface; that only &s;light Errors mu&s;t be the Ground on which the Colouring is laid, and that good Manners mu&s;t give a Poli&s;h to the Whole. No Man has any Degree of Right to invade another's inward Peace, and therefore a well turned Mind will always decline any Thing that comes home to the Bo&s;om of any Per&s;on, with whom he is willing to enter into Society. What|ever may tend to create Di&s;-e&s;teem in the Circle of our Acquaintance, or to throw a ridiculous Light upon a Character; whatever may excite unea&s;y Sen&s;ations by touching upon Circum&s;tances, about which it is po&s;&s;ible a Per&s;on may have a tender Feeling, though in their own Nature, they are not of any material Importance; in &s;hort, all Topics, but &s;uch, as we are convinced the the Object of our Merriment will give up, are care|fully to be avoided; and it will be always highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;o to glide gently over the affected Part, that the Wound may appear to be probed by a &s;kilful Hand. I have &s;omewhere read a Story of <HI>Jack Ketch</HI>'s Wife, which I think throws a Light on this Matter. Any Body, &s;ays that elegant Lady, can tuck a Man up, and &s;top his Breath, but to do it with Dexterity, and make
<PB N="9" REF="12">the Culprit die an ea&s;y plea&s;ant Death, is only the gen|teel Qualification of my Hu&s;band. Thus it requires no very &s;hining Abilities to inform our Neighbour of his Oddities, and point out to him his &s;light Indi&s;cre|tions; but to open his Eyes, and let in the Light with|out rendering it painful to him; to give a Sen&s;e of the Foible without di&s;turbing the natural Complacence, with which every one is willing to behold him&s;elf, is a Ta&s;k which requires more Elegance and Refinement than hap|pens to fall to the Share of every Individual. And yet there is no going any where without meeting Preten|ders in this Way; every Quarter of the Town abounds with Men of Raillery, and to all the&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to render an Account of our Actions, our Friends, our Attachments, our Cloaths, our Walk, and what not? To all the&s;e notable Per&s;onages I would beg leave to recommend the following Story. A Gentleman was one Day &s;having him&s;elf in his Parlour to the great Ad|miration of <HI>Otho,</HI> his Monkey, who &s;tood by him won|derfully plea&s;ed with the Turn of his Wri&s;t, and the Dexterity of every Stroke. The Operation being fini&s;h|ed, and the Gentleman gone out without laying up his Uten&s;ils, <HI>Otho</HI> mounts the Table, fixes him&s;elf before the Gla&s;s and flouri&s;hes the Razor with mimic Skill, till unfortunately he cut his Jaw acro&s;s, and then too late found the Danger of playing with Edge Tools:</P>
<P>I have drawn up an allegorical Account of the Birth and Parentage of <HI>Raillery,</HI> which, I think, may &s;erve to lay before the Reader its &s;everal efficient Qualities.</P>
<P>GOOD-SENSE and RIDICULE were joined in Wed|lock; the Offspring of their Marriage was HUMOUR, who for a long Time roved about <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> placing the Follies and Whims of Mankind in &s;uch a Light, as never failed to excite Mirth in the Synod of <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es. At length happening to wander out of Bounds, HUMOUR met, upon the Borders of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us,</HI> ju&s;t upon the Verge of worldly Commerce, a
<PB N="10" REF="13">certain Lady known by the Name of ILL-NATURE. Drawn in by fal&s;e Allurements and a glavering Smile, which ILL-NATURE always wore upon her Countenance, HUMOUR offered Propo&s;als of Marriage, which were carried without Delay into Execution, and in nine Months Time RAILING was u&s;hered into the World. With a &s;mall Mixture in his Compo&s;ition of his Father's Qualities &s;trongly blended with the complexional Habits of his Mother, RAILING grew up in the Practice of ex|po&s;ing the infirmities of all who came in his Way. With|out Re&s;traint he took unbecoming Liberties with private Families, &s;owed the Seeds of Di&s;content in every Brea&s;t, and in Time began to di&s;turb the Harmony of the &s;acred Nine. Whereupon <HI>Thalia,</HI> conceived an Aver&s;ion to him, and in order to mend the Breed preferred a Pe|tition to <HI>Apollo</HI> to divorce HUMOUR from his Wife ILL|NATURE.</P>
<P>After a full hearing of the Cau&s;e. <HI>Apollo</HI> i&s;&s;ued out his Edict of Separation. HUMOUR could not live &s;ingle, and in a &s;hort Time made another Match, which, as good Luck would have it, turned out better than the former. His &s;econd Wife's Name was WIT, a Lady of great Vivacity, and abounding in &s;urprizing Turns in all her Conver&s;ation. She hardly could &s;ee any Thing, but her Way was in&s;tantly to compare it to &s;ome other Object in Nature, and &s;he frequently would make her Auditors laugh by pointing out a latent Re&s;emblance in Things, which &s;eemed in their own Natures ab&s;o|lutely repugnant to each other. Her principal Atten|tion was to &s;et off her Hu&s;band, and though &s;he was fond of great Variety in her Dre&s;s, &s;he would upon many Occa&s;ions lend her be&s;t Apparel to HUMOUR, who never failed to look mo&s;t engaging, when WIT contributed her Ornaments. HUMOUR, in his Turn, gave &s;upernumerary Embelli&s;hments to his Wife, and they both reflected a reciprocal Lu&s;tre upon each other. They continued in a State of mutual Fondne&s;s, and
<PB N="11" REF="14">their faithful Love was in Time rewarded with a tender Daughter, who was immediately called, with the ge|neral Con&s;ent, by the Name of RAILERY. The MUSES cheri&s;hed her in their Bo&s;oms, and as &s;he grew up &s;he di&s;covered a Propen&s;ity to her Father's Way of thinking, but with a con&s;iderable Abatement of his Se|verity. The Mother's Delicacy &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed entire, and whenever &s;he touched upon any Thing, like her, &s;he endeavoured to give it an agreeable Colouring. In this Habit &s;he was further confirmed by POLITENE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">S, a collateral Relation by the Mother's Side, who took upon her the Care of her Manners, and in&s;tructed her perfectly in all the &s;econdary Qualities or le&s;&s;er Morals, which are commonly known by the Name of Good-breeding. Being confirmed in the&s;e Principles RAIL|LERY was, at a mature Age, tru&s;ted abroad into the World, where &s;he had not been long before &s;he was ca|re&s;&s;ed by the courtly <HI>Horace,</HI> who took her Home to his own Hou&s;e, introduced her to <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> and found her of &s;ingular Service in all his Writings. At the Demi&s;e of that Bard, RAILLERY wandered a Vagrant up and down, till at length &s;he took it into her Head to vi&s;it <HI>Boileau</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> from whence &s;he came over to <HI>England</HI> and re&s;ided for many Years at <HI>Twickenham</HI> with the late Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> from who&s;e Retreat &s;he would now and then make an Excur&s;ion to pa&s;s &s;ome Hours with Doctor <HI>Young</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI> At pre&s;ent, it is &s;aid, that &s;he is taken into Keeping by a certain noble Earl, of whom &s;he is &s;o enamoured, that it is confidently reported, &s;he will not quit his Company, though he is now in Danger of becoming deaf; and it is further &s;aid, that &s;he will &s;tick by him to his la&s;t Breath; but, at that unhappy Juncture what will become of her, no Body can pretend to de|termine.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>Exerci&s;e of the Fan</HI> was propo&s;ed in the Days of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> as a Study highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Scheme, offered to their Con&s;ideration, included all the requi|&s;ite Perfections in the Management of that pretty ver|&s;atile Machine. Though I mu&s;t allow that Directions of this Nature were greatly conducive to a proper Di&s;play of many female Charms, there is &s;till a more u&s;eful Sy&s;tem of Rules for the playing off Love's Ar|tillery, which I beg Leave, through the Channel of your Paper, to convey to the Notice of my beautiful Countrywomen. The Sy&s;tem of Rules which I here intend, is the <HI>Exerci&s;e of the Lips,</HI> and, after mature Con&s;ideration, I think the whole Secret may be com|prized under the following Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="14" REF="17">
<ITEM><HI>Moi&s;ten your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Bite your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Open your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Clo&s;e your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pout your Lips,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Re&s;t your Lips.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Mouth being a leading Feature in the Counte|nance, and the Seat of the Graces, where all the winning Loves and each amiable Smile have planted their Al|lurements, there cannot be too much Care employed by the Ladies to acquire a Pair of well di&s;ciplined Lips, readily obedient to each of the Rules above e&s;tabli&s;hed, and capable with Quickne&s;s and Ea&s;e to perform every Branch of this delectable Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>With Regard to the fir&s;t Word of Command; a due Degree of Moi&s;ture gives a &s;parkling Lu&s;tre to the na|tural Vermillion of the Skin, like Ro&s;es fre&s;h be|&s;prinkled with the Morning-Dew; it contributes like|wi&s;e to hinder them from appearing dry and rough, as is generally the Ca&s;e with old Maids; the lea&s;t Su&s;|picion of which the Ladies &s;eem willing to avoid, by the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te of extending the Shape beyond its ju&s;t Proportion, by a fa&s;hionable Enormity of the Stays.</P>
<P><HI>Biting the Lips</HI> is attended with more Difficulty than the premi&s;ed Rule, becau&s;e it is more complicated in its Nature and includes the Operation of the Pa&s;&s;ions. There are always many Topics in Conver&s;ation, upon which this Practice, if well managed, has a very expre&s;|&s;ive Significance. When, for In&s;tance, di&s;agreeable Thoughts obtrude, it &s;erves to excite new Ideas in the Fancy; it likewi&s;e prevents the un&s;ea&s;onable Eruption of a con&s;cious Laugh, when the Libertine Wit of <HI>Con|greve</HI> or <HI>Vanbrugh,</HI> provokes a betraying Simper; not to mention that it helps to heighten the natural Redne&s;s of the Lip, and rai&s;es a Degree of Anxiety in the Men, for Fear the Delicacy of the Skin &s;hould &s;uffer too much from too violent a Pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">I do not doubt, but it may &s;eem perfectly ea&s;y to open the Lips, but this al&s;o I take to be a Matter of no &s;mall Difficulty. Very few, it is ob&s;ervable, open their Lips to any Purpo&s;e; be&s;ides it &s;hould never be done with too great a Precipitance, but always gradually and by due Degrees. Should there happen to be drawn up, within, an elegant Row of beautiful white Teeth, it will be &s;ure to add greatly to the natural Bloom, by exhibiting an agreeable Contra&s;t; like Ivory &s;tained with a ju&s;t Arrangement of crim&s;on Colours. On this Head it may not be improper to caution my pretty Rea|ders again&s;t an indolent Cu&s;tom of relaxing into a Yawn, which di&s;tends the Mouth beyond its proper Size, and generally occa&s;ions the witty Saying, <Q><HI>Thank you for not &s;wallowing me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Before the Lips are clo&s;ed, it is eligible to confer up|pon them a new Refre&s;hment of Moi&s;ture, and, to en|liven the Colour: If they were to undergo the Opera|tion of Biting, I &s;hould not think it ami&s;s. Shutting the Lips I have often remarked, is extremely becom|ing in mo&s;t Ladies, and, I think, cannot be too much practi&s;ed by old Maids, Wives, and indeed the Gene|rality of Women. In clo&s;ing them, however, there are different Degrees of Pre&s;&s;ure to be ob&s;erved, becau&s;e in this al&s;o the Pa&s;&s;ions are concerned. When they gently touch each other, it gives a Variety to the Air of the Face, by giving it an unu&s;ual Degree of Length; but in this, tho&s;e, who have naturally a long Vi&s;age, are to be particularly cautious. When &s;omewhat com|pre&s;&s;ed, the Dimples in the Cheeks are di&s;played to Advantage, and the whole Face is enlivened with a plea&s;ing Serenity. If &s;queezed clo&s;e together, it throws a beautiful Pen&s;ivene&s;s into the Looks, which is &s;eldom acquired to any Degree of Perfection by the Generality of the Sex; but when properly attained, it carries with it an elegant Kind of dumb Eloquence, which the
<PB N="16" REF="19">Critics have ob&s;erved, is often a great Beauty in Poe|try, and certainly has its Portion of Grace among the fair Sex. I know a Gentleman who can read the Thoughts of any Lady whatever by ob&s;erving the Ad|ju&s;tment of the Lips. He tells me, he has ob&s;erved a Pair of Lips &s;peak, without any Motion for an Hour together, and he has a Li&s;t of Lips, which he &s;ays, are ab&s;olute Prudes; others that are Rakes; &s;ome that are amorous, and &s;ome that are &s;welled with Pride, and from a long Cour&s;e of Enquiry he finds that they have more Electricity than any other Sub&s;tance in Nature.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Remarks belong more immediately to the following Head of <HI>Pouting the Lips,</HI> which is more diffi|cult than any Rule advanced as yet. In doing this, it will be always found expedient to moi&s;ten and bite them fir&s;t, that, when prominent, the Under-lip may look as if pregnant with Delight. The Pa&s;&s;ions of Scorn, Indignation, Contempt, and the whole Family of Pride, are finely marked by this Po&s;ition. I have known a pouted Lip to look down upon a Rival Beauty during an entire Tragedy, and I have &s;een a Lady, without uttering a &s;ingle Word, tell a Man, that &s;he thought him an unmannered Coxcomb, by a forcible Exertion of this expre&s;&s;ive Feature. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this Practice becomes hand&s;ome Faces only; to &s;uch it gives an Air of Elevation, or a pretty Sullenne&s;s, which throws a kind of amiable Severity over the whole Coun|tenance. Ugly Women &s;eldom have this Art in any Perfection.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Rule is to <HI>Re&s;t your Lips,</HI> and is the mo&s;t neglected of any, though highly e&s;&s;ential in this beau|tiful Language. Young Girls can never be brought to pay the lea&s;t Attention to this Precept; but were they &s;en&s;ible, that when the Features are le&s;t to di&s;play their own native Graces without Art, their Charms are irre|&s;i&s;tible, I am convinced this Word of Direction would be better ob&s;erved. This Rule is more exten&s;ive than
<PB N="17" REF="20">the foregoing, becau&s;e it is proper for all Ladies in ge|neral, whereas the former &s;hould never be practi&s;ed but by &s;uch of the Fair, as are ble&s;&s;ed with a blooming Com|plexion and a Delicacy of Features.</P>
<P>The Bounds of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Paper will not permit me to expatiate further; I &s;hall therefore, at Maturity, publi&s;h by Sub&s;cription an entire Book, called the <HI>Oeconomy of the Lips;</HI> in which I &s;hall explain at large the Doctrine here delivered, and I &s;hall adapt each Article to the Make of the Countenance. The whole &s;hall be concluded with <HI>an E&s;&s;ay on the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Fe|male Lips,</HI> and to the Honour of this Part of the Face, I &s;hall prove, that in the&s;e Days of <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> all Reli|gion is centered with them, as what few Prayers are &s;aid at pre&s;ent, come from the Lips only, without the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>Heart</HI> being at all concerned in the Matter. I have the Honour to be,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AMIDST all the frolic Excur&s;ions of Fancy to which you have occa&s;ionally given vent in your <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Compo&s;itions, I have ob|&s;erved that there is not one of them but has &s;ome Degree of Tendency to the In&s;truction, as well as Entertainment of your Readers. On this Account, I hope you will not refu&s;e a Place in your Paper to a Corre&s;pondent, who means to &s;hew the Futility of a Maxim, which has gained Credit with mo&s;t People, though extremely ill-grounded, as, I think, I can fairly evince, from an experimental Knowledge of Mankind.</P>
<P>You undoubtedly recollect that <HI>Ovid</HI> has in one of his Elegies the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tempora &s;i fuerint nubila, &s;olus eris.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, it is &s;o far from being true, that a Man is &s;urrounded with Friends in Pro&s;perity, and is left de&s;ti|tute under his Misfortunes, that I will undertake to prove the very Rever&s;e; in doing this I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of Virtue, and vindicate the Dignity of human Nature.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that I came to this Town, a few Years &s;ince, with Intent to read the Law, having ju&s;t Fortune enough to &s;upport me in my Studies, until I might fix my&s;elf in a tolerable Road of Bu&s;ine&s;s. For this Purpo&s;e I lodged in one of the Inns of Court, and
<PB N="21" REF="24">the Oeconomy, which I was obliged to ob&s;erve, ren|dering it impo&s;&s;ible for me to go much into Company, I &s;oon found out that I led a very muzzy Sort of a Life. I therefore &s;hifted the Scene, and though, in a &s;hort Time, I found means to run out my little Fortune, I cannot &s;ay, that I was relinqui&s;hed by the World on this Account. It is true that &s;ome of my Acquaintance totally de&s;erted me, but it was the Occa&s;ion, at the &s;ame Time, that others were more earne&s;tly attached than they would otherwi&s;e have been. I remember the la&s;t Word my Aunt in the Country &s;aid to me, was <Q><HI>Bob, wherever you go, be &s;ure to make Friends for your|&s;elf,</HI></Q> this Advice, I will venture to &s;ay, I have had the Addre&s;s to conform to with great Succe&s;s, as will appear from the Sequel.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Friend&s;hips of the World are Leagues in Debauchery and Intemperance, made in the drawing of a Cork, and often ended in the &s;ame Manner. <HI>Out of Sight out of Mind</HI> is certainly true, with Regard to the Generality of Connections, but the Impre&s;&s;ions I have made upon the Minds of my Friends are not &s;o ea&s;ily effaced. On the contrary, when it happens that I am &s;eldom &s;een by them, they are known to be in very great Solicitude about me, are con&s;tantly very earne&s;t in, their Enquiries after me, and the Di&s;cour&s;e they u&s;ually have with each other is, <Q>Have you &s;een our old Friend lately&mdash;I can't think what's become of him&mdash;I hope he is not gone out of Town&mdash;I have not &s;een him for a long Time,&mdash;faith, I'm very unea&s;y about him&mdash;I wi&s;h to God he would &s;ee and &s;ettle his Affairs&mdash;He's a very carele&s;s young Fellow&mdash;a great deal too wild &mdash; throws away his Money like Dirt&mdash;I have call|ed upon him Morning after Morning, but all to no Purpo&s;e&mdash;I'd give a Bottle of Wine I could meet with him&mdash;I'd rather that than my Dinner&mdash;I never long'd &s;o much to &s;ee any body.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the general Expre&s;&s;ions of Anxiety which my Friends expre&s;s on my Account, and there are
<PB N="22" REF="25">&s;ome of them who are not content to re&s;t here; Words co&s;t nothing; they carry the Thing to &s;uch a Length as to employ a Couple of Fellows, who are daily in all Quarters of the Town hunting and prying about for me. As there are few In&s;tances of &s;uch earne&s;t Friend&s;hip in the World, I am &s;en&s;ible what I have &s;aid, may have a romantic Appearance, and Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> may &s;ugge&s;t to him&s;elf, that I am entertaining him all this Time with a Novel; but, Sir, I mu&s;t take Leave to a&s;&s;ure you that every Word is literally true, and what may perhaps rai&s;e your Idea &s;till higher, is, not one of all the&s;e People has ever got a Shilling by me; and I verily believe few of them ever will. Having &s;aid thus much in the Prai&s;e of the&s;e my Well-wi&s;hers, it will naturally be de&s;ired of me, to inform the World who and what they are, who are in &s;uch Concern about a Stranger. Not to keep you any longer in Su&s;pence I will now tell you, that I have experienced all this Genero&s;ity from my CREDITORS.</P>
<P>By this it will appear that the Plea&s;ure of being in Debt, though very common in Life, is very little un|der&s;tood by the Generality of tho&s;e, who addict them|&s;elves to this Gratification. The Art in all the&s;e Ca&s;es is to refine upon the Occurrences and Di&s;appointments, to which our State is liable; and, for my Part, the Plea&s;ure ju&s;t mentioned is one of the mo&s;t valuable Enjoyments of my Life. My Morning <HI>Levee</HI> is as great as any Nobleman's, whereas in the Days that that I could &s;ay I was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Competence, I never had any Vi&s;itor whatever, except a Laundre&s;s to make my Bed in the <HI>Temple.</HI> But now the Ca&s;e is perfectly altered; there is a con&s;tant Crowd of Attend|ants about my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oors, and to tho&s;e, that are admitted, I have the Plea&s;ure of making as many Promi&s;es, as a Mini&s;ter of State, be&s;ides a lofty Pride in keeping them much after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion. Upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions it will now and then happen, that they who be&s;t know
<PB N="23" REF="26">how to make their Court, and have the Art of taking a pliant Hour, &s;ometimes prevail upon me to appoint a Day for the Completion of their Wi&s;hes. As Things of Con&s;equence cannot be done in a violent Hurry, the Day, agreed upon is generally very di&s;tant, may be from &s;ix to nine or twelve Months, during which Space of Time, it is ob&s;ervable that their Good-nature never &s;uffers the lea&s;t Abatement, but they remain as &s;olicitous as ever, frequently expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t ten|der Regard for my Welfare. <Q>My dear Sir, do, take a little Care of your&s;elf&mdash;It goes to my very Heart to hear you cough &s;o hard&mdash;Why you'll not live three Months at this Rate&mdash;Be advi&s;ed by me, and put a Stocking about your Neck To-night, and take &s;omething to &s;weat you a little and ea&s;e your Che&s;t&mdash;You &s;hould not drink &s;o much&mdash;Con&s;ider, it impairs both Con&s;titution and Pur&s;e&mdash;You know it's for your Good I &s;peak&mdash;You'd be a great Lo&s;s to your Friends&mdash;Take up a little, Fle&s;h and Blood can't hold it always.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> am I beloved, and that for no other Rea&s;on, but my Addre&s;s in making Friends for my&s;elf, and I am &s;o clo&s;ely watched by the&s;e generous Creatures, that it is totally out of my Power to take any wrong Step, that might be detrimental to my Affairs. Of this I had a convincing Proof about a Year ago, when the Interpo&s;ition of my Taylor hindered me from committing a very incon&s;iderate Action. I was going with a Friend to take a Trip to <HI>Paris,</HI> by which Ex|pedition I mu&s;t certainly have been drained of all my ready Money; but the Vigilance of my Friend contrived to have me &s;topped as I was ju&s;t &s;tepping into the Po&s;t-Chai&s;e, and I was thence conducted to a generous Bai|liff's Hou&s;e in <HI>Gray's-Inn Lane,</HI> for the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds. Here I remained confined till my Pa&s;|&s;ion for Travel was perfectly cooled, and when I was at length re&s;tored to my Liberty, my abovementioned
<PB N="24" REF="27">Friends, took particular Care not to leave me a &s;ingle Shilling, for Fear I &s;hould have the &s;ame unhappy Turn a &s;econd Time.</P>
<P>While I thus enjoy the A&s;&s;iduity and Benevolence of &s;uch a Number, who are kind enough to intere&s;t them|&s;elves in my Affairs, I mu&s;t own there is a Species of Creditors, who are an Exception to the general Rule; for though all tho&s;e of whom I have hitherto been &s;peaking, are upon every Occa&s;ion highly plea&s;ed to meet me, this la&s;t Cla&s;s dete&s;t the very Sight of me. As I am not con&s;cious that I have ever done any Thing to incur their Di&s;plea&s;ure to &s;o great a Degree, their Aver&s;ion &s;hocks me the more; and notwith&s;tanding all the Pains I have taken to &s;often them by Politene&s;s they &s;till remain inexorable. Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them, I endeavour to put them off with the hand&s;ome&s;t Apology in my Power; but all to no Purpo&s;e; I have run too far in Arrears, and they are not by any Means to be &s;atisfied. As I &s;hould be glad if you would give them a Word of Advice I will ju&s;t hint to you that the Per&s;onages, whom I mean, are no other than GENTLEMEN'S SERVANTS. The Cry among them all is, What can a poor Serving-Man do, if he is robb'd of his ju&s;t Vails by &s;uch Scoundrels? They are all very unwilling to let me run further in their Debt, and therefore it is I can hardly get any Thing out of their Hands. If I call for Beer at Table, they are &s;ure not to hear me, till their Ma&s;ter orders them to &s;erve the Gentleman; then I receive the Leavings of the Tankard ju&s;t out of the Hands of the mo&s;t ca|pacious Swallow in the Company. In &s;hort, the Pee|vi&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e my Creditors is a great Di&s;count upon my Happine&s;s, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s there is no kind of Plea&s;ure in being in Debt to them. However I mu&s;t endeavour to bear this Inconvenience, and if you will be plea&s;ed to in&s;ert this Letter in the <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn Journal</HI> I &s;hall be proud to get into your Books, and &s;hall have
<PB N="25" REF="28">the further Plea&s;ure of being indebted to Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> for this Act of Civility which will always oblige me to be,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_A WRITER of periodical E&s;&s;ays is like one, who goes coa&s;ting from Place to Place, with Intent to lay down a Chart of the Cour&s;e of the Country, the Extent of the &s;everal Parts, the Bearings, Limits and Connections. As the latter fails along, every minute Object furni&s;hes him with Matter of Contemplation, and not a Hill lifts its Head, whether cloathed with Verdure and imbower|ed with over-hanging Wood, or wild, barren and crag|gy, but he in&s;tantly trea&s;ures it in the Storehou&s;e of Imagination. Each Rece&s;s of the Land, each Creek, Rock and Harbour demand a particular Notice, and he is frequently induced to pau&s;e in the&s;e Reflections, heedle&s;s of the unbounded Pro&s;pect which the Ocean pre&s;ents him. In like Manner, the Per&s;on who is en|gaged in a Cour&s;e of Lucubrations to be publi&s;hed on a &s;tated Day, is con&s;tantly traver&s;ing about, in order to delineate a ju&s;t Repre&s;entation of the different Scenes of Life, and to gratify his Readers with particular Charts, which may either &s;erve to plea&s;e the Fancy, or contribute to the Purpo&s;es of Improvement and Utility. In his Intercour&s;e with Men and Manners every Occur|rence attracts his Eye; and in his Conver&s;e with Books, he often meets with Pa&s;&s;ages, which de&s;erve to be minutely &s;et down in the Account of his Voyage through this Sea of Troubles, and they may &s;erve as Lights or Landmarks to tho&s;e who are bound upon the &s;ame Adventure.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">It is thus the be&s;t E&s;&s;ays are &s;ugge&s;ted, and I mu&s;t own, I never yet, peru&s;ed a good Author, but I thence deduced &s;ome Hint, which afterwards unfolded &s;everal latent Reflections, that might otherwi&s;e e&s;cape me. The Cla&s;&s;ics are particularly u&s;eful in this Way; They di&s;play, upon all Occa&s;ions, &s;uch bright Traces of a manly Way of Thinking, and abound with &s;o many excellent and clo&s;e Remarks, artfully interwoven with the Thread of their Poem or Narration, that a Man conver&s;ant with their Productions will be always able to draw very amply from their Stores.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing, a few Nights &s;ince, <HI>Florus</HI>'s <HI>Compendium</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, I was greatly &s;truck with an Ob|&s;ervation, in the Character of <HI>Tarquin,</HI> which that Wri|ter, though no extraordinary Ma&s;ter of the Graces and Elegancies of Compo&s;ition, has found Means to in|&s;ert with his u&s;ual Clo&s;ene&s;s. <Q><HI>Tarquin</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Florus</HI>) in&s;ulted all Mankind with an overbearing Pride, which, to an ingenuous Mind, is wor&s;e than Cruelty.</Q> This &s;hort Ob&s;ervation mo&s;t certainly carries with it a great Deal of Truth, and de&s;erves to be enforced with all the Strength of Rea&s;on and Eloquence.</P>
<P>A witty Satiri&s;t has called Pride the univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion, and indeed its Influence on Mankind is &s;o manife&s;t, that there is too much Rea&s;on to believe the Maxim well founded. The general Prevalence of Politene&s;s &s;uppre&s;&s;es in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the Appearance of it among the <HI>French,</HI> but any one, who has been at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> may remember, that after all the Attention and De|ference of the embroidered Gentleman, who undertakes the Office of &s;hewing the Curio&s;ities of the Place, the Ceremony is always concluded with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their national Superiority, which breaks out in a bri&s;k Que&s;tion with a Shrug of the Shoulder. <Q><HI>Eh bien! Mon&s;ieur, avez vous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e pareille magnificence &agrave; Londres.</HI> Well, Sir, have you any Thing equal to this in
<PB N="35" REF="38"><HI>London.</HI></Q> In <HI>Italy, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> their Haughti|ne&s;s is manife&s;ted by the frequent U&s;e of the Stilleto upon every trivial Occa&s;ion; Pride is there di&s;played by killing others, and the People of <HI>England</HI> di&s;cover it by murdering them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Notion of Independance with which a free-born <HI>Briton</HI> is inflamed, renders him untractable and re|fractory to all Laws; <HI>Religion</HI> he makes a Joke of, and he wonders at the Impertinence of the Parliament in attempting to re&s;train his unque&s;tionable Right to di&s;po&s;e of his Per&s;on as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> imputes the Variety of Od|dities, which prevail in this Country, to the general Infection of the Scurvy; but if he had charged it upon our national Sturdine&s;s, I am inclinable to think, he would have a&s;&s;igned a truer Cau&s;e, though, perhaps, at the &s;ame Time, black and &s;izy Blood may not a little contribute to aggravate the Di&s;temper. To &s;peak with Preci&s;ion, Pride is to the Soul what the Scurvy is to the Body, each in their &s;eparate Channels the Source of ill Humours, Maladies and Di&s;orders. The fatal Ef|fects of the corporal Indi&s;po&s;ition, ju&s;t mentioned, have been &s;o &s;everely felt for a long Time pa&s;t, that our common News-Papers are filled with Adverti&s;ements of Chymical Drops, to eradicate it entirely out of the Blood. This certainly would have been a great Benefit to Society, but, I apprehend, he would de&s;erve &s;till more who &s;hould devi&s;e a Cure for the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Mind. On this Account I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee a Paragraph in the Papers to the following Effect.</P>
<Q><P>To Per&s;ons of either Sex, afflicted with any Species of <HI>PRIDE.</HI></P>
<P>NEVER were <HI>Pride, Arrogance,</HI> and <HI>Haughtine&s;s</HI> &s;o frequent as of late Years; nor has any Re|medy been found adequate to this pernicious Habit, which occa&s;ioned a Phy&s;ician of the Soul, who em|ployed
<PB N="36" REF="39">his Thoughts much concerning them, to adapt a Medicine, or Moral Elixir, which is a &s;overeign Re|medy again&s;t PRIDE and all the Variety of Symp|toms, by which it mimics, by Turns, almo&s;t all the Vices poor Mortals are afflicted with, and have their Ri&s;e from a depraved Selfi&s;hne&s;s of Thinking, vicious Fer|ments of Ill-nature, and the Want of Self-knowledge; whence proceed the &s;upercilious Brow, and &s;urly Mo|ro&s;ene&s;s in the Men, and Coquetry, Airs, Fidgets, Tehees and Titters in the Women, which totally de&s;troy their Beauty and their Features, and by a Con&s;ent of Parts affect their Heads, and produce direful Views and terrible Apprehen&s;ions; at other Times, Fits, flu&s;hing Heats, Lowne&s;s and Sinking of the Spirits, Palpitation of the Heart, Twitchings of the Limbs, with many convul&s;ive Di&s;orders, which affect Numbers of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The above Elixir is a wonderful Alterative, oc|ca&s;ions laudable Humility, and as &s;oon as taken, makes the Patient good-humoured, chearful, and affable to Admiration, and is good for all Sorts of People to pre&s;erve, as well as procure, an even Temper of Mind.</P></Q>
<P>Whenever I meet with a proud Man, I &s;hould be glad to know what he takes him&s;elf for; and I have often imagined that if his inward State of Mind were detected to the Eye of the World, it would afford a ridiculous Contra&s;t between his &s;everal Foibles and his fancied Elevation above the re&s;t of his Species. For my Part, it never fails to divert me in a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Manner, when I ob&s;erve a Man &s;it like his Grand&s;ire cut in Alaba&s;ter, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has it, in order to receive the Compliments of every one, without any real Merit to de&s;erve them, and without that reciprocal Compla|cence, which is always &s;ure to procure E&s;teem. I would have &s;uch a one made Emperor of the Moon or re|moved to &s;ome other Sphere fitted for his Reception,
<PB N="37" REF="40">where Cruelty may pa&s;s for Courage, O&s;tentation for Merit, and Pride for Dignity.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;o &s;urely demon&s;trate a narrow Mind, as an Attempt to degrade our Fellow-Creatures by an haughty Arrogance of Carriage. <HI>Hamlet</HI> reckons the <HI>In&s;olence of Office</HI> and the <HI>proud Man</HI>'s <HI>Contumely</HI> among tho&s;e In&s;tigations which might prompt injured Merit to a Deed of extreme De&s;pair, and this further enforces the Severity, which is felt by him, who is obliged to &s;ub|mit to it, and the Cruelty of that human Brute who can think of putting it in Practice.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this Paper without ob&s;erving that there is a right Species of Pride to which every Man is entitled, and that is a Spirit above Dependance, above Flattery, above an abject Deportment, and above every Thing poor, &s;ordid, and little. There is a Pride, which may &s;erve to invigorate Honour, to embolden Truth, and to carry Virtue to an higher Pitch of Improvement, than it might attain una&s;&s;i&s;ted by this &s;econdary Mo|tive. The Plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from this Principle are manly and noble. To enjoy the inward Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Honor and Hone&s;ty, and to exult in the Conviction of a Per&s;on's own Integrity, Probity and upright Inten|tions, is ju&s;t and laudable. Thus much of Pride every one has a Right to, and I know no external Circum|&s;tance, that can rea&s;onably entitle any Man alive to more.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN a former E&s;&s;ay, I threw together a few Thoughts upon the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of an ACTOR; as a Sequel to that Piece, I &s;hall this Day offer &s;ome loo&s;e Hints upon the <HI>Art;</HI> and though this Subject may not be intere&s;ting to every Reader, I yet per&s;uade my&s;elf, as the Drama is the mo&s;t polite and rational of our Diver&s;ions, that an Attempt to throw &s;ome Light upon the Matter, will be received with Candour.</P>
<P>The Precept, which the judicious Author of my Motto has laid down for the good Writer, is likewi&s;e the be&s;t Rule for an Actor; for as both are Profe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="39" REF="42">of imitative Arts, the &s;ame Rule is applicable to each. "I would recommend," &s;ays <HI>Horace,</HI> <Q>to the &s;kilful Imitator a clo&s;e and &s;teady Ob&s;ervance of Men and Manners, and from that Source, I would have him draw an exact Re&s;emblance, and the true Language of Nature.</Q> This Advice, &s;hort and &s;imple as it is, contains the whole Secret of &s;ucceeding with the Pub|lic; and whoever artfully conforms to it, will be &s;ure of acquiring Applau&s;e from crowded Theatres. The Actor, in every Situation on the Stage, is a Copyi&s;t from hu|man Life; the ea&s;y and genteel Deportment of Gen|tlemen, is to be attained by an Intercour&s;e and free Communication with People of that Cla&s;s; the Draw|ing-Room mu&s;t be vi&s;ited for a Knowledge of the Ea&s;e and Dignity of Men of Rank; and by this Habitude, the Performer will fa&s;hion him&s;elf into a Kind of men|tal Elegance, which will not &s;ail to inform his whole Per|&s;on, and &s;et off every Action, with a graceful Facility, at the &s;ame Time that it will enable him to be upon all Occa&s;ions, a more perfect Imitator.</P>
<P>To the&s;e external Circum&s;tances mu&s;t be joined, a clo&s;e and intimate Knowledge of the human Heart; its mo&s;t &s;ecret Movements mu&s;t be unfolded, and the Actor mu&s;t be thoroughly acquainted with their minute&s;t Effects upon the human Body, in what Proportion they agitate the Nerves and Mu&s;cles; how they impre&s;s the Features with their re&s;pective Signatures, elevate or con|tract the Brow, brace or relax the Sinews, and com|mand the Attitude and Di&s;po&s;ition of the whole Per&s;on. There is not a Pa&s;&s;ion, in the whole Train of tho&s;e Feel|ings, to which our Nature is &s;ubject, but what has its own peculiar Adjuncts, its own Air, its own Look, and its own proper Tone. Sorrow unnerves the whole Sy&s;tem, &s;inks the Spirits, and depre&s;&s;es the Voice into a plaintive Melancholy; Anger, on the other Hand, con|tracts each Sinew, &s;ends the Spirits in a Blaze to the Eye, and vents it&s;elf in precipitate and vehement Ac|cents.
<PB N="40" REF="43">In like Manner, every Emotion of the Soul has a &s;ympathetic Influence on the Structure of the Body, and it is the immediate Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Performer, who would a&s;pire to Excellence in the Art, to form to him|&s;elf an exact Definition of each Pa&s;&s;ion, with all its Characteri&s;tics; otherwi&s;e it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him to mark the Progre&s;s and Workings of the Mind, awakened and excited by the Vehemence of their Im|pul&s;e, or to &s;eparate the tender De&s;ire of a <HI>Romeo</HI> from the conjugal Affection of <HI>Jaffier.</HI></P>
<P>After having thus di&s;tingui&s;hed the Nature and Boun|daries of each Affection, the next Step to be taken, is, to watch the various Shiftings and Veerings of the Soul, and to ob&s;erve how the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e and fall, in quick Vici&s;&s;itude. The Mind of Man cannot dwell for any con&s;iderable Time upon one Object; from whence it re&s;ults, that, Love and Re&s;entment, Grief and Joy, De&s;pair and Hope, Rage and Tenderne&s;s, are perpetually taking their Turns in the Brea&s;t. To per|ceive minutely the very Point where the fir&s;t cea&s;es, and the &s;ucceeding one begins to ri&s;e, requires a nice Di&s;|cernment; as in the well wrought Piece of &s;ome emi|nent Hand, the Colours run &s;o artfully into one another, that their gradual Evane&s;cence from the Sight, and their growing by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees into a full Glow, is only to be di&s;covered by the curious Eye. If I do not mi&s;take, the Touch, which &s;o &s;kilfully blends different Colours in this delicate Confederacy, is called by the Painters the <HI>Demi-tint;</HI> &s;hould not &s;omething like this be pre&s;erved, in the Performances of a good Actor, in order to render each Tran&s;ition graceful and natural, to melt the Audience by regular E&s;&s;ays into Tenderne&s;s, or induce any other Impre&s;&s;ion with Ju&s;tne&s;s and Pro|priety? Whatever Pa&s;&s;ion has at any Time taken Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart, mu&s;t abate by Degrees, and the Traces of it mu&s;t be almo&s;t effaced, before a contrary Affection can gain Admittance; and whoever is careful
<PB N="41" REF="44">to mark with Feeling, the Ebbing out of the one, and Flowing in of the other, will be always &s;ure to have an irre&s;i&s;tible Command over his Audience.</P>
<P>But the Matter does not re&s;t here; the Performer, who is ambitious of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf for ma&s;terly Touches in Scenes of Vehemence, will find another la|tent Secret, in the intellectual Sy&s;tem, which mu&s;t ne|ver e&s;cape his Notice. It mu&s;t be remembered, that there are frequent Occa&s;ions, in which the Brea&s;t is di&s;tracted by two different Pa&s;&s;ions at once, both working the Heart-&s;trings in one mixed Emotion. The&s;e com|plicated Agitations of the Mind are often imperceptible to all but the &s;kilful Ob&s;erver; and, therefore, as the Actor's chief Difficulty lies in this Point, a feeling Expre&s;|&s;ion of it will always be a Proof of his Excellence, and Strokes of this Nature, well executed, will impre&s;s on every Brea&s;t the livelie&s;t Sen&s;ations.</P>
<P>It often happens in mere de&s;criptive Poetry, that the Writer ob&s;erving &s;ome &s;urprizing Agreement between Things, which in their Natures &s;eem totally incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, from thence takes occa&s;ion to re|concile Contrarieties in &s;uch an agreeable A&s;&s;emblage, that the ta&s;teful Reader is entertained with a Picture, which at once amu&s;es his Fancy and &s;atisfies his Judg|ment. <HI>Virgil</HI> has many delicate Touches of this Na|ture, and <HI>Horace,</HI> who had Art enough for every poe|tic Embelli&s;hment, has heightened his Odes with &s;e|veral Beauties of this Sort. In this Cla&s;s of Elegan|cies may be reckoned the following Pa&s;&s;ages;
<Q><L><HI>Urit grata Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ervitas;&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pignu&s;que direptum lacertis</HI></L>

<P><HI>Milton</HI> al&s;o, who has every &s;ofter Delicacy in minute De&s;criptions, as well as every lofty Image in the &s;ublime,
<PB N="42" REF="45">has in&s;erted many beautiful Colourings of this Species in his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>grinned horrible a gha&s;tly Smile,</HI> is an admirable In&s;tance. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has given to Thoughts of this Nature the Title of <HI>thwarting Ideas;</HI> and he adds, that they are &s;ome of the fine&s;t Strokes in the whole Compa&s;s of Poetry. If I might be allowed to carry this Hint further, I &s;hould call all Strokes of this Kind, where the Mind is worked into a Ferment, by the Name of <HI>thwarting Pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> and I will venture to &s;ay, that they will be univer&s;ally acknowledged much more beautiful than that mere Cla&s;h of Ideas, which the eminent Critic ju&s;t mentioned has &s;o much in&s;ided upon; becau&s;e they not only &s;urprize with a &s;eeming Contra&s;t, but al&s;o intere&s;t the Heart; which is the Perfection of Poetry. The <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, and indeed the fine Writers among the Moderns, are full of the&s;e pathetic Repre&s;entations of human Nature; but among them all, I do not remember a finer In|&s;tance, than a Pa&s;&s;age in Mr. <HI>Whitehead</HI>'s <HI>Roman Father,</HI> when that Hero is reflecting on the Combat, which is to decide the Fate of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;Had I a thou&s;and Sons in &s;uch a Cau&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I could behold 'em bleeding at my Feet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And thank the Gods with Tears.&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>To expre&s;s the&s;e complicated Sen&s;ations, where &s;e|veral Pa&s;&s;ions at once agitate the Soul, requires &s;uch a Command of Countenance and Voice, that it is cer|tainly the greate&s;t Perfection of an Actor, and with a Kind of magic Power it always leads us into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>If the Bounds of my Paper would admit it, I &s;hould here indulge my&s;elf in examining our pre&s;ent Per|formers, with Regard to the three Divi&s;ions of the Pa&s;|&s;ions above e&s;tabli&s;hed. To one, I &s;hould, perhaps, a&s;cribe the Merit of expre&s;&s;ing with proper Enforce|ment
<PB N="43" REF="46">the Sentiments of haughty Anger and tyrannic Cruelty; in another I &s;hould chiefly admire the grace|ful Tran&s;ition from Rage to Tenderne&s;s, and probably I &s;hould not he&s;itate to &s;ay, of a third, that he is excellent in all Vici&s;&s;itudes of the Mind, and that in mixed Sen&s;a|tions he penetrates to the very Soul of his Hearers; and, were I to add, that, in many Situations, I have expe|rienced the &s;ame from Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> it would be but barely doing her that Ju&s;tice, which her excellent Art de&s;erves.</P>
<P>From what has been premi&s;ed, it will appear, that to expre&s;s the Emotions of the human Heart is the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Actor, and no Account is ever to be made of Figure, Voice, or any other external Circum|&s;tances, unle&s;s it be when they combine with the Per|former's Feelings to make deeper Impre&s;&s;ions on an Au|dience. I have known an Actor lengthen out the Tone of his Voice, and if it &s;ounded clearly, imagine his Bu&s;ine&s;s finely executed, when Nature and the Pa&s;&s;ions required that he &s;hould &s;peak in another Key, and in broken, &s;hort, and vehement Accents. <HI>Quinctilian</HI> has a ju&s;t Remark on this Head "as Poets," &s;ays he, <Q>profe&s;s to &s;ing their Works, Ver&s;e &s;hould be repeated in a Manner &s;omewhat elevated above common Di&s;|cour&s;e, with a Sweetne&s;s properly tempered by Di&s;|cretion, and not thrilling into a wanton Luxuriance of Sound, as if the Throat had been gargled for the Purpo&s;e.</Q> I &s;hall only add, a lively Imagination is the Talent, which an Actor &s;hould principally culti|vate, as it is that, which excites tho&s;e pathetic Feel|ings, without which no Man will ever &s;ucceed on the Stage, and with which it is hardly po&s;&s;ible totally to fail.</P>

<P>_HOW vain and fanta&s;tic are all human Pur|&s;uits? How un&s;ettled and incon&s;tant are our Tempers; one Day pining for the At|tainment of &s;ome imaginary Good, and, the next, hating our&s;elves for all that Perplexity of Thought which our whim&s;ical De&s;ires occa&s;ioned in our Brea&s;ts? How often are the &s;obere&s;t Under&s;tandings di&s;turb'd by Agitations of Spirit about Things in them&s;elves of no Kind of Moment or Importance, and when once the Tumult has &s;ub&s;ided, how contemptible do we appear to our&s;elves, for having been &s;o weak as to yield to the Impre&s;&s;ion? Every Period of Life is marked with this Incon&s;tancy; the Child has Perplexities which the Boy laughs at; and ripened by a further Acce&s;&s;ion of Years into Manhood, our previous Occupations become ri|diculous, 'till at length old Age thinks the whole a
<PB N="46" REF="49">Series of Follies, in&s;en&s;ible to its own Infirmities, and lit|tle aware that the Pa&s;&s;ions operate at that Juncture with le&s;s Celerity, not becau&s;e Rea&s;on is grown &s;trong, but on Account of the enfeebled Tone of all the mental Powers; like a Weather Cock, which being grown ru&s;ty, is not moved with every Breath of Wind, but &s;lowly veers from Point to Point. I am inclined to think that the human Soul will be always in this Progre&s;&s;ion, con&s;tantly making each Moment a Critic on the la&s;t, and and that as &s;oon as the Spirit &s;hall be unbodied, it will in&s;tantly &s;mile at our wi&s;e&s;t Employments in this World, our deepe&s;t Reflections, and our mo&s;t &s;erious Specu|lations. I was engaged in this Train of Thought the other Night, and having an Imagination, which does not very &s;oon detach it&s;elf from the Objects that have once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, the &s;ame Scenes of Reflection di&s;|clo&s;ed them&s;elves to me in Sleep, and formed a Pro|&s;pect, not unentertaining to my Fancy.</P>
<P>I thought the Hemi&s;phere on a &s;udden brightened with more than common Lu&s;tre, a Flood of Glory diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through all Creation, and from an Opening of the Heavens appeared, high exalted on a Throne, THE GE|NIUS OF HUMAN KIND. After a Trumpet had &s;ounded three Times, the following Sounds were awfully pro|nounced. <Q>Let all tho&s;e fleeting Spirits, which for|merly animated corporal Tenements, forthwith ap|pear from their &s;everal Man&s;ions of Retribution, and let tho&s;e who now &s;upport a feveri&s;h Exi&s;tence upon Earth, in&s;tantly repair hither, dive&s;ted of their bodily Incumbrance, and account before our dread Pre&s;ence, for the U&s;e they have made of their Time, during their State of Probation.</Q></P>
<P>The Edict was immediately obeyed, and I fancied that I had no &s;ooner emerged from my Tenement of Clay, than every Thing wore another Appearance, and new Faculties of Perception were a&s;&s;igned me. Vani&s;hed were the original Colours, concerning which
<PB N="47" REF="50">&s;o many Volumes have been written; Wit, Ta&s;te, Learning, Philo&s;ophy, Mathematics, and even Money it&s;elf appeared an ab&s;olute Chimaera; and &s;everal Per|&s;onages beginning to addre&s;s the Throne, I was further confirm'd in my Opinion that all was Idlene&s;s, Vanity, and unavailing Vexation.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> declared his whole Poem to be the Rhap&s;ody of an ever-weening Imagination: He owned his ce|le&s;tial Councils and his Battle of the Gods, to be a Jumble of Ab&s;urdities; his bolde&s;t Flights of Fancy appeared quite contemptible, and he wondered how he could ever employ his Faculties in &s;tringing together &s;uch wild enthu&s;ia&s;tic Reveries.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> owned that he knew nothing of the fir&s;t <HI>Good,</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Perfect,</HI> and fir&s;t <HI>Fair;</HI> and Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury</HI> wi&s;hed that, in&s;tead of being guided by that Pagan Philo&s;opher, he had made u&s;e of the Light of Revelation, which might have afforded him &s;ome faint dawning Ideas of that Truth of which he is now perfectly convinced. He added, that he did not know what he was about when he wrote his Rhap&s;ody and many other Parts of his Performance, and that he now looked back at them with Contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> declared his Sy&s;tem of Logic to be nothing but an idle Scheme of laboured Perplexities, calculated to puzzle and bewilder Mankind. <HI>Pindar</HI> &s;mil'd at his Olympics, and did not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that he really believed he was mad when he wrote them; and old <HI>Euclid,</HI> who, I believe never once laughed on Earth, bur&s;t into a loud Expre&s;&s;ion of Mirth, when he re|flected upon his Endeavours to &s;quare the Circle, and his &s;everal Triangles and Quadrangles, which he owned do not contribute in any Degree to the Advancement of Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> frankly confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Child for weep|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more Worlds. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> declared he would as contentedly be the la&s;t in a Village, as the fir&s;t in <HI>Rome;</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="51">and <HI>Pompey</HI> had no longer an Aver&s;ion to an Equal; <HI>Cicero,</HI> without elaborating a Period of a Mile, con|demned his Pur&s;uit of Fame as no more than the cha|&s;ing an empty Bubble; and he added, that he never thought him&s;elf properly employed but when expatia|ting again&s;t the minute Philo&s;ophers. <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted that his whole <HI>Aeneid</HI> &s;hould be burned. <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> both laughed at the Duration of their Works which in their Days of Nature they flattered them&s;elves would be indelible Monuments of their Fame.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, among all the celebrated Per&s;onages of Antiquity, every one accu&s;ed him&s;elf of Mi&s;application, and even <HI>Titus</HI> complained that he had lo&s;t many Days.</P>
<P>There were tho&s;e who acknowledged that they ne|ver knew Unea&s;ine&s;s in Life, but what was occa&s;ioned by the Succe&s;s of others, and that they were always completely happy, or completely mi&s;erable by Com|pari&s;on. <HI>Poets</HI> laugh'd at all their Pains to tag a Rhyme and their Solicitude for Works which now appeared to them in a proper Light; and <HI>Criticks</HI> acknowledged that they took too much unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble to de&s;troy Productions of &s;o peri&s;hable a Nature. The Mi&s;er rail|ed at <HI>in&s;olvent Gold,</HI> as it is finely called by the witty Doctor <HI>Young,</HI> and his Heart expanded with Genero&s;ity and &s;ocial Affection.</P>
<P>The &s;ofter Sex pre&s;ented them&s;elves among the Re&s;t on this Occa&s;ion; but the Simper of Self-Admiration no longer di&s;played it&s;elf. They were not anxious a|about the Glo&s;s of their Skin, the Arrangement of a Curl, or the Di&s;po&s;ition of a Patch. The &s;nowy Brea&s;t cea&s;ed to heave with &s;tudied Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the Shape was not tortured a thou&s;and Ways, in order to look at|tractive in the Eye of Man. The Labours of the Toilet were now de&s;pi&s;ed, and each Fair-one wondered how Dre&s;s could make &s;o great a Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life; and how they could ever take &s;o much Pride in peri&s;h|able Clay, however neatly moulded, and however tinc|tured with a plea&s;ing Hue. They were now per|&s;waded
<PB N="49" REF="52">that true Beauty dwells in the Mind; Drums, Routs and Cards were held in Contempt, and as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has it, They viewed with Scorn two Pages and a Chair. They were all a&s;hamed of the Fal&s;ehoold of their Friend&s;hips, their Tehees and Titters at a ruined Character, their &s;everal Turns of Coquetry, Di&s;&s;imulation, and all the Variety of female Artifice. In &s;hort, Mankind in general owned them&s;elves di&s;tract|ed with Cares beneath a rational Creature; and Envy, Pride, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Perfidy and Ambition &s;well'd the va&s;t Account.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Di&s;turbers of our Happine&s;s I was re|joyced to &s;ee my Fellow Creatures relieved; and to perceive Love, Joy, and Benevolence effacing gra|dually all Traces of former Guilt, gave me an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Delight. But I &s;oon found I was not in Reality launched into Eternity, and therefore my Joy, like all Things &s;ubject to Time and mortal Chance, &s;oon came to an End. The Fumes of Sleep were di&s;&s;ipated, and I awaked from my Dream. Loo&s;e as it is, the Reader may derive this Moral from it, that there is nothing in human Life worth the Anxiety it creates, and that it &s;hould be our Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre|&s;ent to fix tho&s;e Propen&s;ities and Habits in our Souls, which we &s;hall not have Occa&s;ion hereafter to wi&s;h totally effaced, and which it is probable we &s;hall be carrying to an higher Degree of Purity in tho&s;e Man|&s;ions, which are prepared for our future Exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>_I PAID a Vi&s;it, a few Days &s;ince, to a Lady, for whom I always entertained a very high E&s;teem, on Account of a plea&s;ing Turn of Conver&s;ation, and many other good and agreeable Qualities, which &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Millefont</HI> (for that is her Name) was never known to have the lea&s;t Propen&s;ity to Scandal or De|traction: She does not concern her&s;elf with the imper|tinent Knowledge of, who and who were together at the Ma&s;querade, who were &s;een to interchange a few fond Regards at the Theatre, or who has lately had an
<PB N="51" REF="54">Ill run at Play. Politene&s;s, Good-nature and Affability are her characteri&s;tic Perfections, and &s;he is ready to allow Wit and Beauty in others, as well as in her own Daughters; though in my Opinion, it is a rare Thing to &s;ee them equalled by any of their Sex. Both the young Ladies are tall and graceful; elegant in Shape and delicate in their Features; extremely like each other in the Turn of the Face, and &s;till each of them forming, if I may be allowed to u&s;e the Phra&s;e, a different School of Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet,</HI> being two Years elder, is rather more formed and higher in Bloom than her Si&s;ter, but &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible of the approaching Eclip&s;e which her Beauty mu&s;t &s;uffer very &s;hortly, when all the Charms, which are at pre&s;ent budding forth in the Per&s;on of <HI>Charlot,</HI> have attained their full Perfection. Tho' <HI>Harriet</HI> is &s;en&s;ible of this, &s;he yet perceives it without any Pronene&s;s to Envy. On the contrary &s;he rallies her&s;elf with great Vivacity, and will fairly own that &s;he is upon the Look|out for a Man for her&s;elf, before <HI>Charlot</HI> becomes &s;o mi&s;|chievous a Beauty, as to engro&s;s the Attention of every Beholder; and then, &s;ays &s;he, <Q>I &s;hall lo&s;e all my Ad|mirers, and &s;o I'm re&s;olved to get married out of the Way.</Q></P>
<P>On this Account &s;he at pre&s;ent throws the Dart like a Tyrant, as the Poet phra&s;es it, though I am convinced when &s;he re&s;igns her Per&s;on, her good Sen&s;e will then lead her to imitate the Gentlene&s;s and amiable Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Charlot</HI> who does not aim at being &s;o fierce a Beauty as <HI>Harriet,</HI> but is chiefly de&s;irous to be Mi&s;tre&s;s of wil|ling Hearts. She does not endeavour to kindle her Eyes into that Glare of Fire, for which many others are re|markable, but unambitiou&s;ly &s;he lets them &s;hine in their own native Mildne&s;s; and if the captivates every Heart it is without any premeditated De&s;ign. In &s;hort, the Difference between the&s;e two young Ladies is this;
<PB N="52" REF="55"><HI>Charlot</HI>'s Charms have a con&s;tant Emanation, and <HI>Harriet</HI>'s Beauties are in a perpetual Exertion.</P>
<P>I &s;pent an Hour in the mo&s;t agreeable Manner with this Family, when <HI>Harriet</HI> in her giddy Manner gave a new Turn to the Conver&s;ation by a&s;king me, <Q>Pray, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> can you tell me &s;omething about <HI>Mack|lin</HI>'s new Scheme; pray what is the Man about?</Q> &mdash;To this I replied, that I really was not &s;ufficiently in the Secret; that he has built two magnificent Rooms, and intends to furni&s;h them in an elegant Manner; the Apartment on the Ground-Floor to be a public Cof|fee-Room, and the other for the Reception of Gen|tlemen of Rank and Education; but that, however, I was afraid he would &s;hare the common Fate of Pro|jectors.</P>
<P><Q>Well, I vow and prote&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Harriet,</HI> it's a vexa|tious Thing to &s;ee how the&s;e Men are always contri|ving Places for their own Accommodation, without Troubling their Heads about the Women. The odious Things are always herding with one another, and the Ladies are &s;eque&s;tred from all the Joys of the&s;e convenient Meetings. Does not one hear them eternally &s;aying with an Air of Indifference, Ma'am I mu&s;t go the Coffee hou&s;e, and &s;o &s;aunter away with that janty carele&s;s Air, that never fails to provoke me? &mdash; Well, I wi&s;h the Women would agree to have a Coffee-hou&s;e of their own, to be revenged of the Fellows&mdash;Lord, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> it would do charm|ingly; don't you think &s;o Si&s;ter?&mdash;It would &s;o tan|talize the Creatures, to &s;ee us going into a Place, where none of them can gain Admittance&mdash;they would be &s;o proud to wait at the Door to hand us to our Chairs; and it would be &s;uch a Plea&s;ure to go and meet one's Acquaintance without going con|&s;tantly in a &s;tiff Dre&s;s to Routs and Drums; dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> you mu&s;t give us an helping Hand; you mu&s;t give us an E&s;&s;ay upon it, you wild Devil.</Q> With this &s;he
<PB N="53" REF="56">tapped me on the Shoulder, in her lively agreeable Man|ner, and in&s;i&s;ted with all the Rhetoric of a Romp, that I &s;hould propo&s;e her Scheme to the Public, which I a&s;&s;ured her I &s;hould take the fir&s;t Opportunity to perform.</P>
<P>I have ever been of Opinion, that, in the general, Coffee-hou&s;es, are not of &s;uch Advantage as is gene|rally imagined, mo&s;t of the&s;e Places being frequented entirely by Bucks, Bloods, and Rakes, of all Denomi|nations, from whom there is nothing to be acquired ex|cept a Swagger in the Gait, a drunken Totter, a noi&s;y riotous Deportment, a Volley of Oaths and a total Want of what is called Good Breeding. Perhaps this Opportunity of detaching them&s;elves from the Ladies in Coffee-hou&s;e Clubs is the Cau&s;e of that Aukward|ne&s;s, which is frequently remarkable in Per&s;ons, who from their Fortunes and Situation in Life &s;hould be better accompli&s;hed, and on this Account I am ap|prehen&s;ive, that a Rendezvous of this Nature might have &s;ome ill Effect upon the Deportment of the Fair; but &s;hould this Scheme be carried into Execution, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that it will in many Re&s;pects &s;et the Ladies upon a <HI>Par</HI> with the Men, and the Conve|nience of meeting People of Fa&s;hion, without the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Parade of going to their Hou&s;es, will certainly be very great; al&s;o Appointments with each other may be fixed with Ea&s;e by the Means of this In&s;titution; and a Memorandum Book, placed at the Bar, as at the <HI>Bedford</HI> and other Places, may &s;erve for the following Purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>BY Letters from a Corre&s;pondent abroad, we are in|formed, that when Mon&s;ieur <HI>Voltaire</HI> was arre&s;ted by order of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> there were found, among his Papers, &s;everal Tran&s;lations of different Pa&s;|&s;ages in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> done &s;o extremely ill, that it is conjectured, he purpo&s;ely made u&s;e of a frigid Languor of Expre&s;&s;ion, in order to le&s;&s;en the Poet's Reputation abroad, in hopes that then him&s;elf might be &s;et down as the greate&s;t dramatic Poet in the World. But to quiet this re&s;tle&s;s Ambition, we mu&s;t inform him that <HI>Apollo</HI> has long &s;ince i&s;&s;ued out his Prohibition, &s;o that he may &s;well, like the Frog in the Fable, without ever coming near him. <HI>Non &s;i te ruperis, inquit, par eris.</HI> The &s;ame Advices mention, that, there were al&s;o &s;e|veral abu&s;ive Paragraphs on the &s;ame immortal Bard, very improper from the Pen of a Scholar and a Gentle|man.

<P>_IT was the An&s;wer of a certain eminent <HI>Jew,</HI> when a&s;ked by what Means he accu|mulated the very large Fortune, which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, that he had more Difficulty in acquiring the fir&s;t Three Thou&s;and Pounds, than all the Re&s;t of his immoderate Wealth. This Apothegm may be &s;aid to comprize the whole Arcanum of ri&s;ing in the World, but as not one of the
<PB N="57" REF="60">Adepts in the Science has thought proper to di&s;cover the &s;ecret Art of putting this Rule in Practice, it is to be apprehended, the Indigent will find as many Diffi|culties as ever to retard their Progre&s;s, and hinder them from emerging out of their Embarra&s;&s;ments. The Au|thor of my Motto has ob&s;erved, many Ages &s;ince, that the mo&s;t exalted Virtues, and the rare&s;t Accompli&s;h|ments do not find it ea&s;y to extricate them&s;elves out of Difficulties; and the Cour&s;e of human Contingencies has proved the Maxim true to this Day.</P>
<P>There is perhaps hardly any Man, but can point out in the Circle of his Acquaintance certain Per&s;onages of very exten&s;ive Capacities, &s;trong and quick Parts, and a delicate Sen&s;e of Honour, who are not however able to rai&s;e them&s;elves to any con&s;picuous Point of Emi|nence, merely becau&s;e their Talents have not been called forth by Opportunity, or animated by Succe&s;s. Genius wherever it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, mu&s;t be warmed and che|ri&s;hed, otherwi&s;e it is apt to langui&s;h and decay; the fine Sen&s;ations, which are attendant on an enlightened Under&s;tanding, occa&s;ion a certain Delicacy in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or's Way of thinking, which renders him liable to a Dejection of Spirits upon many Occa&s;ions in Life. Refined Parts &s;hould be tenderly pre&s;erved, or they are liable to be chilled by the Bla&s;ts of Adver&s;ity; like tho&s;e Fruits, which would wither unripened in our cold northern Clime, were they not carefully a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their Vegetation by the adventitious U&s;e of hot Beds.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tance, which in my Opinion reflects the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre upon the Character of Lord <HI>Sommers,</HI> is the Encouragement he afforded to &s;uch a Genius as Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who might have remained in a le&s;s con|&s;picuous Point of View without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a Patron. His Vein of Humour, which is now the gen|teele&s;t in the World, might have taken a Tincture from low Life; his delicate Raillery might have &s;ub|&s;ided into coar&s;e and vulgar Railing; His Ta&s;te, which
<PB N="58" REF="61">was fini&s;hed by Travel and every other Advantage, might have grown quite callous and indelicate: for his Sentiments of Morality might have been &s;ub&s;tituted a Strain of Ribaldry, to awaken the Blum of Confu&s;ion in that female Face, which, as Matters happened, he took &s;o much Pains to &s;et off in the Smiles of native Innocence and unaffected Beauty; and that Pen, which entertained the Town with &s;ome of the mo&s;t elegant Productions of human Wit, might have been employed in Politics, per&s;onal Invective, and Party-rage. But the kindly Protection of the Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> hindered him from &s;inking into Ob&s;curity, and from being compelled by Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ully that fair Fame, which is now the Reward of his excellent Performances. The A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of &s;o eminent a Per&s;on was a Kind of Demand upon him, for all that elaborate Elegance, which now di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf in his Writings.</P>

<P>It has been the Fate of many, endowed perhaps with Parts not very inferior to <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> to droop in Indi|gence, their poetic Fires totally extingui&s;hed, and I make no Manner of Doubt, but in the pre&s;ent Age, there are tho&s;e who might become &s;hining Ornaments of the Republic of Letters, were there any Incitement to &s;pur the Mu&s;es Steed. But a Treati&s;e on <HI>Cribbidge,</HI> or a Calculation of the Chances at Whi&s;t, is &s;ure of being better received at pre&s;ent, than the Odes of a <HI>Collins,</HI> or any Performance of di&s;tingui&s;hed Genius. While a <HI>Smart</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among us, I cannot help thinking it an indelible Reproach to the Age, that he has not any where &s;ound a <HI>Mecaenas,</HI> and that he is &s;uffered to draw his Pen in the Prai&s;es of his Maker, without receiving any other Reward, than a &s;mall Premium at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and that Portion of Fame, which, in Spight of Malice and Envy, he will be always &s;ure to enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">Wit is generally con&s;idered as an Object of Ridicule rather than an Accompli&s;hment de&s;erving Encourage|ment and E&s;teem, and the Narrowne&s;s of Fortune, in which mo&s;t of the literary Tribe are &s;ituated, is a &s;tanding Topic of Plea&s;antry, and to call a Man a Poet, is, in mo&s;t Companies, a &s;troke of irre&s;i&s;tible Hu|mour. The witty Doctor <HI>Young</HI> has ridiculed this with his u&s;ual Delicacy.</P>

<P>There is hardly any Thing more affecting to a Man of real Merit, than to find him&s;elf &s;corned by the In&s;o|lence of Pur&s;e-pride. People of Affluence &s;hould con|&s;ider when they attempt to depreciate Men of &s;u|perior Parts, that they betray an unmanly Triumph over tho&s;e, who have &s;till their Fortune to make. But, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> finely ob&s;erves, the World in general is apt to form an Idea of a Man, at the Time he is lea&s;t able to make a proper Judgment for him&s;elf; and from thence it re&s;ults, that we find many utterly ruined by &s;light Errors, trivial Indi&s;cretions, and petty Inadver|tencies, while others owe their Elevation to Vices, to head&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, and a Series of &s;elfi&s;h Views, which are, for the greater Part, more &s;ucce&s;sful, than Mode&s;ty, a &s;ober Under&s;tanding, and a Spirit above abject Flat|tery and mean Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They who &s;it &s;miling at the Goal of Fortune, while others are running the hardy Cour&s;e, &s;hould reflect, that it is po&s;&s;ible for Per&s;everance and unremitted Ap|plication, to reach the very Point, in which they take &s;o much Pride; and then it is evident on which Side the Superiority will be found. A well turned Spirit, with the Advantages of a genteel Education and a compe|tent Knowledge of the World, mu&s;t certainly receive
<PB N="60" REF="63">additional Lu&s;tre from an Acce&s;&s;ion of Wealth, and the Accompli&s;hments of &s;uch a one, will, in their Turn, adorn and embelli&s;h Affluence. On this Account, <HI>Ju|venal</HI>'s Maxim is without Di&s;pute, highly ju&s;t; a great Re&s;pect, &s;ays he, is due to Youth. The Practice of this Ob&s;ervation I would recommend to all Parents, Uncles, Guardians, and all Ranks of People, who have any Concern in the Education of the ri&s;ing Generation; as it is to be apprehended that they frequently, by too much Precipitance in their Conduct, drive them to Ex|tremes, which a little Indulgence might prevent, and by which they might become valuable Members of Society.</P>

<P>_THERE is not, in my Opinion, a more exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure in the Power of Man, than what ari&s;es from an internal View of his own mental Con&s;titution. To ob&s;erve the various A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas, combined with a Ra|pidity, which &s;carcely leaves a Trace behind it, to watch the &s;ubtile Movements of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and thence to deduce the &s;ecret Source of many of our Sen|&s;ations, which are in Appearance extremely compli|cated and &s;urprizing, is a Ta&s;k requiring the fine&s;t Per|ception in the Re&s;earch, and al&s;o productive of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Knowledge we can boa&s;t, and the highe&s;t Delight our Faculties are &s;u&s;ceptible of.</P>
<P>The Solution of a mathematical Problem may be agreeable to that Curio&s;ity, which is implanted in us.;
<PB N="62" REF="65">and the <HI>Newtonian Philo&s;ophy</HI> may expand the Imagina|tion with &s;tupendous Ideas of the Di&s;tances of heavenly Bodies; but in the&s;e Occupations, like <HI>Swift</HI>'s Taylor, it is po&s;&s;ible, we may mi&s;take one Figure, and then all our ingenious Labour evaporates into Air; whereas in the Pur&s;uit of Self-knowledge our Rea&s;onings are from Feeling, and all our Di&s;coveries, be&s;ides the Ad|vantage of being as &s;urprizing as in any other Science, carry with them a further Acce&s;&s;ion of Plea&s;ure, as we are our&s;elves more immediately concerned in them. In travelling through an open champain Country the Pro&s;pect on every Side may admini&s;ter to the Plea&s;ures of Imagination; but a Man will certainly feel more lively Sen&s;at ons when riding upon Land belonging to him&s;elf; the Land&s;kip of his own E&s;tate will look more beautiful to the Eye, the Lawn &s;hall &s;pread a more plea&s;ing Verdure, and the Di&s;covery of a Mine, or the &s;ecret Spring of a little Rill running through his Mea|dows, aford him a Delight not to be equalled by the gaye&s;t Scenes that can be pre&s;ented to him.</P>
<P>The Study of the human Mind is, therefore, the mo&s;t rational and plea&s;ing Employment we are capable of; for my Part I am always highly delighted when any accidental Circum&s;tance throws me into this Tract of thinking, and whether reading <HI>Rabelais</HI>'s frolic Rav|ings, or the &s;ublime Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Homer,</HI> I am &s;ure ever and anon to lay a&s;ide the Volume, in order to trace the Plea&s;ure, which I have received, to its hid|den Source, and to account for the Appearance upon &s;ome Principle in our Con&s;titution. An Opportunity of gratifying this Turn occurred to me the other Day, when ca&s;ually turning over &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful Pa&s;&s;ages in epic Poetry, I could not help taking notice, that I peru&s;ed the De&s;cription of Thou&s;ands &s;tretched upon the Field of Battle, weltring in Blood, agonizing with their Wounds, and trampled under Hor&s;es Hoofs, without feeling any of tho&s;e Propen&s;ities to Compa&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="63" REF="66">which were frequently awakened in me by the Death of a &s;ingle Per&s;on. I could read with the greate&s;t Compo&s;ure and Serenity, Lines, which mention dying Groans of Numbers falling in one promi&s;cuous Carnage, broken Limbs of Warriors, Men and Hor&s;es, all mixed in one general Scene of De&s;truction.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Tum vero gemitus morientum, &amp; &s;anguine in alto</HI></L>
<L><HI>Armaque Corporaque &amp; permi&s;ti caede Virorum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Semianimes volvuntur Equi&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>A Mu&s;ter-Roll of Heroes, who in one Line em|braced their Fate, did not move me to the lea&s;t t&eacute;nder Sen&s;ation.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Chloreaque, Sybarimque, Daretaque, Ther&s;ilocumque.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alcandrumque, Haliumque, No&euml;monaque, Prytanimque.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Mind is totally impa&s;&s;ive in all the&s;e general Ac|counts of the Calamities of War; but, when the Poet thinks proper to di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;ingle Per&s;on from the Throng, we melt in Pity of his Fate, heedle&s;s of the general Deva&s;tation, which is &s;pread around him. That this is the Ca&s;e every Body that has read the <HI>Aeneid</HI> will be ready to acknowledge; and yet it might be imagined that our Hearts &s;hould be more inten&s;ely agitated, when De&s;olation &s;weeps whole Ranks of our Fellow-Creatures from the Face of the Earth, than when we read the Fate of an Individual; but &s;uch is our Di&s;|po&s;ition, that we can go through all the&s;e Narratives without Emotion, and when the epic Writer throws out but a &s;hort Reflection upon the Fall of one Man, we are in&s;tantly fixed in Attention, and our Hearts throb with Compa&s;&s;ion for his untimely End.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this I take to be, that in the former Ca&s;e, we are only told, that &s;o many embraced their Fate in Battle, in which Circum&s;tance there is nothing to excite Commi&s;eration in a rea&s;onable Being. Death is one of the Conditions of human Life, and we all
<PB N="64" REF="67">hold our Exi&s;tence in this World upon the &s;ame preca|rious Tenure. We therefore con&s;ider the De&s;criptions of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> as no more than a mere Bill of Mortality, and when they inform us that &s;uch a Num|ber peri&s;hed upon the Spot, we peru&s;e it with as much Calmne&s;s as the Paragraph which tells us, <Q>Encrea&s;ed in the Burials this Week five hundred.</Q> And further, when they tell us, that, one receives an Arrow in the jugular Vein; another has a Spear run through his Shoulder, and is rivetted with his Body double to the Ground; a third is wounded in the Mouth and has his Head &s;plit in two, it may &s;erve, as the Critics ob&s;erve, to give Variety to the Battle, but in Fact, amounts to no more than what we read in a common News paper, <Q>Ye&s;terday a Labourer fell from the Top of an Hou&s;e, by which Accident he broke his Collar bone and in|&s;tantly expired.</Q> An Account of bodily Pain has but a very &s;light Influence upon our Pa&s;&s;ions; it is men|tal Di&s;tre&s;s that principally operates upon our Hearts, and our Pity ri&s;es in Proportion to the Agitations of Mind, which we perceive in the Per&s;on afflicted. Be|&s;ides this, the Poet frequently finds collateral Avenues to our Souls, by a Mention of Family-Connections, and to heighten our Sorrow, he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the moral Sen&s;e of his Reader, and intere&s;ts him &s;till more in the Fate of his Hero, by repre&s;enting his amiable Qualities, and the elegant Accompli&s;hments, which would have rendered him a de&s;erving Member of So|ciety. By the&s;e Mears our tendere&s;t Feelings are awakened, and the Effect is not unlike what a Man may experience in a Church-yard, where he &s;ees a Multitude of different Graves in which, the good, the bad, the old and young lie in promi&s;cuous Silence, and he therefore beholds the Scene without Emotion; but as &s;oon as the Tomb &s;tone pre&s;ents a Character of one di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Re&s;t, he then laments the generous Friend, the tender Hu&s;band, the indulgent
<PB N="65" REF="68">Father, and mourns for him who acted agreeably to the Relations in which he &s;tood to his Fellow Crea|tures. Thus when we read of a dying Per&s;on, that he was a Friend of the Mu&s;es, and that Harmony was the Delight of his Soul, we con&s;ider him in a different Light from tho&s;e, who as Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, are celebrated for nothing but being knocked in the Head.
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;Amicum Cretea Mu&s;is,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cretea Mu&s;arum Comitem, cui Carmina &s;emper</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et Citharae Cordi, numero&s;que intendere Nervis.</HI></L></Q> When we are told of another, that his Death was la|mented by his Friends in &s;undry Parts of his Country, we cannot help joining in the general Grief.
<Q><L><HI>Te Nemus Agnitiae, vitre&acirc; te Fucinus und&acirc;,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Te liquidi flevere Lacus.&mdash;</HI></L></Q> The Number of Sufferers is encrea&s;ed, and our Pa&s;|&s;ions encrea&s;e in Proportion to the Knowledge conveyed to us of their Affections, their tender Friend&s;hips, and their Schemes for future Happine&s;s. One falls in the Mid&s;t of his half-fini&s;hed Projects; him his blooming Mi&s;tre&s;s mourns with frantic Sorrow, and all his Re|lations bewail his Lo&s;s. Another receives his mortal Wound through the very Garment which his Mother worked for him with her own Hands.
<Q><L><HI>Trar&s;iit &amp; Parmam Mucro, levia Arma minacis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et Tunicam, molli mater quam neveral Auro,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Implevitque &s;inum &s;anguis&mdash;</HI></L></Q> Be&s;ides the&s;e little Touches which the epic Writer oc|ca&s;ionally makes u&s;e of to awaken and engage the Pa&s;|&s;ions, they are further obliged to diver&s;ify their Battles with Epi&s;odes, or &s;hort Accounts of particular Adven|tures, in order to &s;ecure our Attention, and relieve us from that general Scene of Slaughter, which, they are con&s;cious we peru&s;e without any of tho&s;e Sen&s;ations, which it is the primary Excellence of Poetry to excite.

<P>_MY Readers will ob&s;erve, that I frequently &s;elect Mottos, for my Papers, from the Author, who&s;e Name I have prefixed to this Day's E&s;&s;ay; the Rea&s;on of it is, his Sen&s;e is &s;o refined, and the Turn of his Expre&s;|&s;ion &s;o peculiarly delicate, that his Remarks are inter|mixed with my own ordinary Ideas, in &s;uch a Manner, that they recur to me, upon almo&s;t every Occa&s;ion. <HI>Horace</HI> is &s;o &s;en&s;ibly and elegantly &s;ententious, not only in his Epi&s;tles and Satires, which are profe&s;&s;edly moral Di&s;cour&s;es, but al&s;o in his lighter Odes, and his gaye&s;t Excur&s;ions of Fancy, that I have often thought, an ex|cellent Sy&s;tem of Morality, might be extracted out of his. Writings; I have even carried this Hint &s;o far, as to think &s;eriou&s;ly of publi&s;hing a Tran&s;lation of all his excellent ethic Ob&s;ervations, which would, in my Opinion, be the be&s;t Collection of Thoughts on various Subjects, that has ever been offered to the Public.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age, which I have placed at the Head of this Paper contains a very beautiful Moral. <Q>Who is there,</Q> &s;ays the Bard, <Q>that can de&s;ire an Acce&s;|&s;ion of fal&s;e Honour, who is not &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome in|herent Defect? and who can be alarmed at the Bla&s;ts of Calumny and Detraction, who bears in his own Heart a Regard to Truth?</Q>&mdash;This Sentence con|tains
<PB N="69" REF="72">&s;uch indelible Marks of a virtuous Di&s;po&s;ition, that it &s;hould be written in Letters of Gold, and im|pre&s;&s;ed in deep Characters on the Heart of every Man, who would pa&s;s through Life with an hone&s;t and fair Fame, as it &s;ugge&s;ts a ju&s;t Contempt for all ill-grounded Applau&s;e, and furni&s;hes the Man of upright Heart with the proper Weapons of a noble Di&s;regard for the mean De&s;igns of Slander and Malevolence.</P>
<P>Hypocri&s;y is con&s;idered, by all Morali&s;ts, as the mo&s;t de&s;picable and infamous Di&s;ea&s;e of the Soul; it di&s;covers a Sen&s;e of the Grace and Beauty of a fair Character, but generally carries with it a total Ab&s;ence of all good Qualities. It aims at E&s;teem, by artfully concealing the latent Imperfections, and exhibiting to the public Eye a glo&s;&s;y Appearance of &s;omething amiable and hone&s;t. But unle&s;s the Mind is thoroughly weeded, in &s;pight of every artful Di&s;gui&s;e, the lurk|ing Mi&s;chief will, one Time or other, break out, and as <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, like a wild <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> force its Way through the very Liver;

<P><PB N="70" REF="73">Certain it is, that for the Formation of a ju&s;t Cha|racter, it is requi&s;ite to have a perfect Knowledge of Right and Wrong &s;ettled in the Mind, Virtue &s;hould be ledged in the Soul, and the Heart &s;hould glow with generous Truth; but as the World now goes, there is more Art to acquire the popular Opinion than Merit to de&s;erve it; and the general Method, by which People gra&s;p at Fame, con&s;i&s;ts in depreciating &s;ome Neighbour's Character. Thus the female Beauty aims at being a general Toa&s;t, by detracting from &s;ome other Fair-one. The Merchant endeavours to extend his own Credit and Corre&s;pondence by an artful Pro|pagation of Su&s;picions to another's Di&s;advantage, and the Quack, after &s;etting forth the unerring Efficacy of his No&s;trum, clo&s;es his Adverti&s;ement with, <Q>Beware of Counterfeits, for &s;uch are abroad.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> ob&s;erves, that for one Man to detract from another, and to think of aggrandizing him&s;elf at the Expence of his Neighbour, is more again&s;t Nature, than Death, than Grief, or any other Calamity incident to human Life.

<P>A Reputation otherwi&s;e obtained mu&s;t certainly af|ford very little Satisfaction, and it will &s;till admini&s;ter le&s;s, when we con&s;ider, that it is only, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> calls it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> HONOUR, gained from the ignorant, from the &s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">re&s;ted, the mean, and the contemp|tible,; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">word &s;ua munera c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;ays a Writer already quoted; let the Underlings of Mankind keep their Commendations to them&s;elves; for the Prai&s;e of &s;uch is beneath the Ambition of an hone&s;t Man, and by Parity of Rea&s;on, their Cen&s;ure, their Di&s;approbation,

<P>_AT the la&s;t Meeting of our Club, my Friend, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> informed us, that he had lately &s;een the Character of King <HI>Lear</HI> admirably performed by Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> and that he had &s;ince thrown together &s;ome Remarks upon that excel|lent Tragedy, which he de&s;ired I would this Day com|municate to the Readers of the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Journal.</HI></P>
<P>To be able to critici&s;e a Poet with any Degree of Per&s;picuity, it is requi&s;ite to con&s;ider the Nature of his Fable; and the moral U&s;e of the Work. This being &s;ketched, we may then proceed to ob&s;erve how he lays on his Colouring, the Di&s;po&s;ition of each Per&s;on|age, the Expre&s;&s;ion of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and which is the capital Figure in the Piece. <HI>Lear</HI> being examined in this Manner, it will appear that the Author intended to exhibit, in the mo&s;t &s;triking Colours, the horrid Crime of Filial Ingratitude. To enforce this he repre&s;ents an old Monarch tired with the Cares of State, and wil|ling to di&s;tribute his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions among his Daughters, in Proportion to their Affections towards his Per&s;on. Accordingly, the two that flatter him obtain all, the third Si&s;ter being di&s;inherited for her Sincerity, and the King is at length driven by the Ingratitude of his two elde&s;t Daughters, to an extreme of Madne&s;s, which produces the fine&s;t Tragic Di&s;tre&s;s ever &s;een on any Stage.</P>
<P>As this is the Ground-work of the Play, I am &s;ur|prized that any Critic &s;hould impute the Madne&s;s of <HI>Lear</HI> to the Lo&s;s of Royalty. The Behaviour of his
<PB N="74" REF="77">Children is always uppermo&s;t in his Thoughts, and we perceive it working upon his Pa&s;&s;ions, till at Length his Mind &s;ettles into a fixed Attention to that &s;ingle Ob|ject. This, I think, will appear in a critical Exami|nation of the Play.</P>
<P><HI>Lear,</HI> in his fir&s;t Scene, &s;hews him&s;elf &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t violent Emotions. The Poet has drawn him impetuous to the greate&s;t Degree, proud, haughty, re|vengeful, and tender-hearted. In &s;uch a Mind it is not to be wondered that Ill-treatment &s;hould excite the mo&s;t unea&s;y Sen&s;ations. He takes fire at an imaginary Ap|pearance of Di&s;affection in <HI>Cordelia.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>But goes thy Heart with this?</HI></L>
<L><HI>So young and &s;o untender!</HI></L></Q>
<P>He is &s;oon after alarmed with Su&s;picions of Di&s;re|&s;pect from <HI>Gonerill,</HI> "I will look further into't."&mdash;He then is convinced of her contemptuous Di&s;regard, and the Effect it has upon him, indicates a Mind, impotent and liable to the wor&s;t Perturbations.
<Q><L><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> Lear <HI>walk thus? &s;peak thus? where are his Eyes?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Either his Notion weakens, his Di&s;cernings</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are lethargy'd.&mdash;</HI></L></Q> His Reflections after this &s;hew what is neare&s;t to his Heart.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Ingratitude! thou marble-hearted Fiend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>More Lideous, when thou &s;hew'&s;t thee in a Child,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than the Sea-Mon&s;ter.&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>He ob&s;erves that <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s Fault was &s;mall; and when even that made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on him, what are we to expect from his fiery Di&s;po&s;ition, when rejected by tho&s;e to whom he had given all? His Imprecation, though big with Horror, is the natural Re&s;ult of his Indignation; and the Tenderne&s;s and Overflowings of Softne&s;s, which melt him in the mid&s;t of his Vehe|mence, produce a fine Conflict of Pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>There have been many Poets who were acquainted in general with the Pa&s;&s;ions of human Nature, and ac|cordingly we find them con&s;tantly de&s;cribing their Ef|fects; but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Art &s;hows their Impul&s;e and their Workings, without the Aid of Definition or flowery De|&s;cription. Be&s;ides the general Survey of the Heart, he was more intimately ver&s;ed in the various Tempers of Mankind than any Poet whatever. We always find that he makes the Pa&s;&s;ions of each Per&s;onage in his Drama operate according to his peculiar Habit and Frame of Mind; and, in the Tragedy in Que&s;tion, there are &s;o many Strokes of this Nature, that in my Opinion, it is his Ma&s;ter-Piece. In every Speech in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mouth, there is &s;uch an artful Mixture of thwarting Pa&s;&s;ions, that the Heart-&s;trings of an Audience are torn on every
<PB N="76" REF="79">Side. The frequent Tran&s;ition and Shifting of Emo|tions is natural to every Brea&s;t, but in <HI>Lear</HI> they are cha|racteri&s;tical Marks of his Temper.</P>
<Q><L><HI>I pr'ythee, Daughter, do not make me mad.</HI></L>
<L><HI>I will not trouble thee my Child. Farewel.</HI></L>
<L><HI>We'll meet no more&mdash;no more &s;ee one another.</HI></L>

<P>In this Speech every Ma&s;ter-pa&s;&s;ion in his Temper ri&s;es in Conflict, his Pride, his Revenge, his quick Re|&s;entment, and his Tenderne&s;s. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has beauti|fully repeated In&s;tances of this Nature, in almo&s;t every Line, and the following Pa&s;&s;age has &s;ome of the fine&s;t Turns in the World.</P>

<P>Here the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Monarch leaves his Daughter's Roof, and the next Time we &s;ee him, he is on a wild Heath in a violent Storm, where all his Reflections take a Tincture from the gloomy Colour of a Mind di&s;ea&s;ed with Angui&s;h, and we &s;oon &s;ee what is the principal Object of his Attention.
<PB N="77" REF="80">

<Q><L><HI>O! that Way Madne&s;s lies&mdash;let me &s;hun that&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No more of that&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>As yet the Perturbation of his Mind does not &s;eem fixed to a Point; he begins to moralize, but &s;till with a View to his own Afflictions, until <HI>Edgar</HI> enters di&s;|gui&s;ed like a Madman. <HI>Lear</HI>'s fir&s;t Que&s;tion is, <Q>have his Daughters brought him to this Pa&s;s? could&s;t thou &s;ave nothing? did&s;t thou give them all?</Q>&mdash;And this I take to be the fir&s;t Touch of fixed Madne&s;s in the Play, and might point out to any Man the Cau&s;e of his De&s;traction, without thinking of the Re&s;ignation of his Sceptre, or the mere Lo&s;s of regal Power.</P>
<P>As our Hero is now out of his Sen&s;es, a new Field opens it&s;elf to the Poet. He had before di&s;play'd every Movement of the Heart, and the human Under&s;tanding now becomes his Province, in which, we &s;hall find, he acquits him&s;elf with the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Skill. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>Madmen do not &s;eem to have lo&s;t the Faculty of Rea&s;oning; but having joined together &s;ome Ideas very wrongly, they mi&s;take them for Truths; and they err as Men do that argue right from wrong Principles. For by the Vio|lence of their Imaginations, having mi&s;taken their Fancies for Realities, they make right Deductions from them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">Agreeably to this Account, <HI>Lear,</HI> upon the Appear|ance of a Madman, takes it for granted that it is owing to his Daughters ill-treatment, and when contradicted, he replies, <Q>Death! Traitor! nothing could have &s;ub|dued Nature to &s;uch a Lowne&s;s but his unkind Daugh|ters</Q>&mdash;He next takes him for a Philo&s;opher, and agreeably to that Notion enquires <Q>what is the Cau&s;e of Thunder?</Q></P>
<P>In his next Scene a De&s;ire of revenging his Grievances actuates his Mind;
<Q><L><HI>To have a thou&s;and with red burning Spits</HI></L>
<L><HI>Come hizzing in upon 'em!</HI></L></Q> He then proceeds to arraign his Daughters in a Court of Ju&s;tice. <Q>Arraign her fir&s;t, 'tis <HI>Gonerill.</HI> I here take Oath before this honourable A&s;&s;embly&mdash;&s;he kicked the poor King her Father&mdash;Here is another too who&s;e warpt Looks proclaim what Store her Heart is made of.</Q>&mdash;He &s;till continues to dwell in Imagination upon the Crime of Ingratitude, which appears to him &s;o &s;hocking that he exclaims, <Q>Let them anatomize <HI>Regan;</HI>&mdash;&s;ee what breeds about her Heart&mdash;Is there any Cau&s;e in Nature for the&s;e hard Hearts?</Q> This la&s;t Stroke cannot fail to draw Tears from every Eye. The Reader will plea&s;e to ob|&s;erve, that all this Time there is not a Word &s;aid of his Royalty, on the contrary, he &s;ays to <HI>Edgar,</HI> <Q>You, Sir, I entertain for one of my Hundred; only I do not like the Fa&s;hion of your Garment,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which hundred, was appointed after his Abdication.</P>
<P>After this how was <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to repre&s;ent <HI>Lear</HI> again &s;o as to keep up the Pa&s;&s;ions, and heighten the Di&s;tre&s;s? By taking Advantage of every Circum&s;tance in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Temper. He had &s;aid that he would rea&s;&s;ume the Shape, he had ca&s;t off: This then remained untouched, and accordingly in the next Scene we perceive him ac|tually putting it in Execution, and his Fancy &s;ugge&s;ts to him, that he is a King; from which he rea&s;ons as
<PB N="79" REF="82">from every other Principle, and always with an Eye to his Children. "No," they cannot touch me for "coining; I am the King him&s;elf." <Q>There's my Gauntlet&mdash;I'll prove it on a Giant.</Q> From this, his Imagination wanders. <Q>Bring up the brown Bills&mdash; O well flown Barb! i'th' Clout! i'th' Clout&mdash; Hewgh, give the Word.</Q>&mdash;From this Rambling he &s;oon returns, and the habitual Ideas again take Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of him. <Q>Ha <HI>Regan! Gonerill!</HI> they flattered me like a Dog,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this, <HI>Glo'&s;ter</HI> enquiring if it is not the King, he catches at the Word and an&s;wers, "Ay, every Inch a King." And then he draws &s;ome more Inferences from that Notion, till he reflects that <HI>Glo'&s;ter</HI>'s Ba&s;tard Son was kinder to his Fa|ther than his own Daughters, got in lawful Sheets. From this he digre&s;&s;es into an Invective again&s;t Wo|men, and continues raving, till at length his Spirit of Revenge returns upon him. <Q>And when I've &s;tolen upon the&s;e SONS-IN-LAW, then kill, kill, kill, kill.</Q></P>
<P>It was <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Art to re&s;erve his being crowned with Straw for the la&s;t Scene of his Madne&s;s, as it is a Repre&s;entation of human Nature reduced to the lowe&s;t Ebb. Had he lo&s;t his Rea&s;on on Account of his abdicated Throne, the Emotions of Pity would not be &s;o inten&s;e, as they now are when we &s;ee him drove to that Extreme by the Cruelty of his own Children. Every Topic of parental Di&s;tre&s;s being exhau&s;ted, and all the King's Ma&s;ter-Pa&s;&s;ions di&s;played in his Mad|ne&s;s, the Poet judiciou&s;ly &s;hews him gradually coming to him&s;elf in the next Scene; and we &s;ee the Ideas dawning &s;lowly on his Soul.
<Q><HI>Where have I been?&mdash;where am I?&mdash;fair Day-light!</HI></Q> In this Recollection of his Rea&s;on, he never once men|tions the Lo&s;s of Royalty, but again touches upon the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;tre&s;s in his Speech to <HI>Cordelia.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="83">
<Q><L><HI>I know you do not love me; for your Si&s;ters</HI></L>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO addre&s;s a Letter to you under the Character of of Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> I am per&s;uaded needs little Apo|logy; e&s;pecially when it goes from one, who, though a Stranger to you, has a real Regard to your Reputation as an Author, and having often received great Plea&s;ure from your Weekly E&s;&s;ays, takes this Liberty of throw|ing out his Thoughts to you on a Piece of Critici&s;m in which he differs with you is Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">Your Paper of la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> an Examen of King <HI>Lear,</HI> and you think many Critics have mi&s;taken the principal Idea in the old King's Mind during his State of Madne&s;s: After citing <HI>Lear's</HI> Exclamation on the Ingratitude of his Daughters you add, <Q>This might lead any Man to the Cau&s;e of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madne&s;s, without thinking of the Re&s;ignation of his Sceptre.</Q> But certainly, whoever con&s;iders <HI>Lear</HI>'s Character with Attention, will from the very Pa&s;&s;age you quote, be&s;ide an hundred others, think there is much to be &s;aid on the other Side of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I have read with great Plea&s;ure &s;everal of the Remarks you make on the Speeches in <HI>Lear,</HI> which are &s;uch as can ari&s;e only in the Mind of a Reader of Ta&s;te; but I cannot agree, that <Q><HI>He mu&s;t be unfeeling to the great Art of our Poet, who can look for any other Cau&s;e of Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI></Q> in the Madne&s;s of the King, than the In|gratitude of his Daughters.</P>
<P>I know not in what Manner you may treat the Re|marks I am about to make, but I can &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you, they are only intended as Hints to your&s;elf, on a Subject which I think of &s;ome Con&s;equence to the Ad|mirers of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>The Critic in the <HI>Adventurer</HI> was &s;omewhat wanting in Ju&s;tice to the Poet, by mentioning the Lo&s;s of Royal|ty as the &s;ole Cau&s;e of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madne&s;s, without taking Notice at the &s;ame Time of the forcible Idea he mu&s;t have of the Ingratitude of his two Daughters; and I think Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> al&s;o wrong, in excluding intirely his Opinion. What I purpo&s;e here is, to point out <HI>both the Ideas</HI> working &s;trongly in his Mind, and what the Author intended as conducive to the Moral of his Play.</P>
<P>No Critic on <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> can better explain the Cha|racters he draws, than the Poet him&s;elf does in every Speech; we not only &s;ee what his Per&s;ons are during the Scene repre&s;ented, but we are al&s;o made acquainted by &s;ome nice Touches in each Play, with their former Mode of thinking and acting; and as no Poet ever un|der&s;tood.
<PB N="84" REF="87">Nature better in the Operation of the Pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;o he always makes them &s;peak and act in the highe&s;t Conformity to their Characters: In this Re&s;pect his Genius and Judgment is every where equal to <HI>Horace</HI>'s Precept,
<Q><HI>Aetatis cuju&s;que notandi &s;unt tibi Mores.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Lear</HI>'s Deportment and Sentiments in regard to his Daughters in the fir&s;t Act, and what <HI>Gonerill</HI> &s;ays of him to <HI>Regan,</HI> mark very plainly his Character; which is, that of <HI>a haughty, pa&s;&s;ionate, incon&s;tant, weak old Man.</HI> He does not re&s;ign his Authority to his Daughters &s;o much out of Love to them, as to rid him&s;elf of the Cares of Government&mdash;He retains the Name of King with a &s;uitable Train of Attendants&mdash;He &s;till commands with his former Impetuo&s;ity of Temper, and is jealous even of Trifles. This the ill natured Character of the Daughters will not &s;uffer, and they are in Con&s;ultation in the mo&s;t undutiful and unbecoming Manner to de|prive him of his remaining Shew of Power: Their Be|haviour and Ingratitude &s;oon appear in the mo&s;t glaring In&s;tances, and make the old King &s;orely &s;en&s;ible, that he had <HI>given them</HI> ALL.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nature was <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Guide, he de&s;cribes the Imagination affected by concurring Cau&s;es to pave the Way for a Scene of the highe&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;<HI>Lear,</HI> as a King and Father feels with great Sen&s;ibility the Shocks, of his Daughters Ingratitude and unnatural Treatment, and exhibits a moving Picture of the Feelings of the Heart, and the various Conflicts of Pa&s;&s;ions very expre&s;|&s;ive of his Character and Circum&s;tances; if the Poet had nothing more in view, he might have been well con|tent with the ma&s;terly Picture he has drawn of his Di|&s;tre&s;s, Grief, and Rage in every Scene before the Lo&s;s of his Sen&s;es; but he has crowned the Di&s;tre&s;s by making him at la&s;t fix his Imagination on his own Ra&s;hne&s;s and Folly in giving away his ALL, and putting it out of his
<PB N="85" REF="88">Power to avenge him&s;elf. And 'tis this Reflection chief|ly drives him to Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The je&s;ting of his Fool wholly turns upon his <HI>unking|ing him&s;elf</HI> and retaining <HI>nothing,</HI> which <HI>Lear</HI> minutely attends to, and &s;ays, "A bitter Fool!&mdash;After <HI>Go|nerill</HI>'s Propo&s;al to reduce his Train, he breaks out, <HI>"Woe! that too late repents."</HI>&mdash;Then the Ingratitude of his Daughters and his own Folly deeply &s;trike him.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;O Lear, Lear, Lear!</L>
<L><HI>Beat at this Gate that let thy Folly in,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And thy dear Judgment out.</HI></L>
<L>Afterwards he &s;ays to <HI>Gonerill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thou &s;halt find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That I'll re&s;ume the Shape which thou di&s;t think</HI></L>
<L><HI>I have ca&s;t off for ever.</HI> Gon. <HI>do you mark that?</HI></L>
<L>In the next Scene, wrapt up in Thought, he &s;ays,</L>
<L>To TAKE 'T AGAIN PERFORCE!&mdash;<HI>Mon&s;ter Ingratitude!</HI></L></Q>
<P>In this Line the two Ideas are &s;trongly blended, and the <HI>Lo&s;s of Power</HI> foremo&s;t, for &s;urely that was the obvious Rea&s;on of the In&s;ults he had received; if he had &s;till been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they would have continued to &s;prinkle him with <HI>Court Holy-water:</HI> The Fool, who&s;e Phra&s;e the la&s;t is, &s;ays,
<Q><L><HI>Fathers that wear Rags,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Do make their Children blind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Fathers that bear Bags,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall &s;ee their Children kind,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here take Notice of the different Colouring u&s;ed by our Poet, and all good Writers, in di&s;tingui&s;hing the Characters of Men &s;eemingly agitated by the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Lear</HI>'s Idea of his Folly, in dive&s;ting him&s;elf of his Authority, is nicely and artfully di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> from that Kind of Regret, which an im|perious Man of a different Character would feel from the Deprivation of Power.&mdash;He is full of the Lo&s;s of his Dignity, only as it was the Occa&s;ion of the ill Treat|ment he met with, and not from a Thir&s;t of Rule.&mdash;
<PB N="86" REF="89">This Idea and that of the Ingratitude of his Daughters, which he feels as the Con&s;equence of it, I cannot help thinking, are as clo&s;ely united in his Madne&s;s, as two Twigs twi&s;ted together, and growing out of the &s;ame Stem.</P>
<P>When he exclaims and reproaches his Daughters in that heart-piercing Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s on the Heath, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>O Regan! O Gonerill!</L>
<L><HI>Your old kind Father! who&s;e frank Heart</HI> gave all&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>O that Way Madne&s;s lies&mdash;Let me &s;hun</HI> THAT&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>No more of</HI> THAT&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>On his Recollection that he <HI>gave all,</HI> he breaks &s;hort and immediately &s;ubjoins, "O that Way Madne&s;s lies; let me &s;hun <HI>that;</HI> no more of <HI>that;&mdash;i. e.</HI> Let me not think that I have been guilty of &s;o much Folly, as to have given <HI>all</HI> to &s;uch ungrateful Wretches&mdash;the Reflection will make me mad.</P>
<P>I know it may be in&s;i&s;ted on by you, and perhaps by many others, that <HI>Lear</HI> makes u&s;e of the Sentiment of <HI>giving all,</HI> only to tax the Ingratitude of his Daughters in a higher Degree; but, tis po&s;&s;ible, you may be of a contrary Opinion, if you can allow, that the Moral of this Play, does not expo&s;e the Ingratitude of Children, more than the Folly of Parents. <HI>This &s;ame Folly of Parents</HI> is al&s;o touched with great Judgment in the Under-plot of <HI>Glo'&s;ter;</HI> and the Characters of <HI>Lear</HI>'s two Daughters are finely contra&s;ted with tho&s;e of <HI>Cordelia</HI> and <HI>Edgar;</HI> and the Poet's De&s;ign in marking out &s;o &s;trongly the Folly and ill-judged Partiality of Parents is confirmed by the Behaviour of <HI>Edmund</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>When <HI>Lear</HI> &s;ees the Wretchedne&s;s of <HI>Edgar,</HI> he pur&s;ues the &s;ame Train of Rea&s;oning which before po&s;|&s;e&s;t him, and a&s;ks, <Q><HI>Did&s;t thou</HI> GIVE ALL <HI>to thy Daugh|ters!&mdash;And art thou to come to this?</HI></Q> And immediately after,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
<Q><L><HI>What! Have his Daughters brought him to this Pa&s;s?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Could'&s;t thou</HI> &s;ave nothing?&mdash;<HI>did'&s;t thou</HI> give them all?</L></Q></P>
<P>This is agreeable to his Character&mdash;And from all that we hear in common Life (for there are many Stories) of old weak Parents, who have acted much in the Man|ner of <HI>Lear,</HI> and to the Reproach of human Nature, have met with Ingratitude and Di&s;obedience; the&s;e, I &s;ay, in their Feeling-hours of Di&s;tre&s;s, are reported to have re|proached them&s;elves with their Folly in GIVING ALL, as well as exclaimed again&s;t the Ingratitude of their Children.</P>
<P>There are many Characters, I doubt not, now in the World, who retain a Heap of Trea&s;ure, u&s;ele&s;s to them|&s;elves, from their Children, on no better Motives, than to in&s;ure their Duty and Attention; and &s;ome who carry the Moral of this Play to a ridiculous Height, by deny|ing their Children an Independance, merely on the &s;ame Parity of Rea&s;oning, without con&s;idering the Difference between the Prudence of Parents and their Folly.</P>
<P>I FORBEAR making any Quotations from <HI>Lear</HI>'s Speeches in his Madne&s;s. I think the Whole obvious enough, and that our immortal Poet, who had a perfect Knowledge of the Workings of the human Mind, has drawn <HI>both the Ideas</HI> in <HI>Lear</HI>'s Madne&s;s, agreeable to the Repre&s;entation he has made of him in the fir&s;t Act.</P>
<P>What I have hitherto &s;aid, is entirely confined to the different Opinions of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> and the <HI>Adventurer;</HI> nor do I expect that you &s;hall alter your's in Conformity to my Judgment.&mdash;Let a diligent Examination of the Play determine you in the future Critici&s;ms you intend to give the Public on this Subject.</P>
<P>WHAT has often occurr'd to me, in reading over the &s;everal Editions of our Poet, and what has been &s;aid by you, and many great Geniu&s;&s;es, only &s;erve to convince me of the Difficulty of any one Man's &s;ucceeding in a perfect Critici&s;m on <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> at lea&s;t, I have Rea&s;on
<PB N="88" REF="91">to think &s;o, from what I have &s;een of the &s;everal At|tempts that have been made by different Commentators from the Time of Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI> to the mutilated Condition our Poet was thrown into by &s;ub&s;equent Editors.</P>
<P>Several Per&s;ons have &s;ucceeded in illu&s;trating many of the Characters he draws, and have pointed out to public Notice, many of his latent Beauties; but, I be|lieve, <Q><HI>there is &s;carce one Man alive</HI> (to &s;peak in the Stile of a very extraordinary Addre&s;s to a great Man, in la&s;t <HI>Saturday's In&s;pector) who is even capable of call|ing all his Beauties by their proper Names,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>exhibiting them all with Advantage to the Public;</HI> who&s;e Property <HI>they now are, if they will acquire a Ta&s;te to enjoy 'em.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I can't forbear mentioning the Obligation which the Public has to the Genius of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> who has ex|hibited with great Lu&s;tre many of the mo&s;t &s;hining Strokes of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s amazing Art; and may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled (as he was once called by you) his be&s;t Commen|tator: For 'tis certain, he has done our Poet more Ju&s;tice by his Manner of playing his principal Characters, than any Editor has yet done by a Publication.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with the &s;ame Freedom as I began, by de&s;iring you will con&s;ider my Manner of treating this Subject, as the mere Hints of a friendly Letter, and not as an E&s;&s;ay on the Subject in Di&s;pute.</P>

<P>_THOUGH I have in my two la&s;t Papers entirely confined the Attention of my Rea|ders to critical Enquiries, I &s;hall make no Apology for offering another E&s;&s;ay this Day upon a Subject nearly connected with tho&s;e Mat|ters, the more e&s;pecially as the Honour of our Coun|try is in &s;ome Sort concerned in the pre&s;ent Lucubration again&s;t a <HI>French</HI> Writer, upon whom I have formerly animadverted, and who has taken in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of his Works, unbecoming Liberties with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion.</P>
<P>Prefixed to <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s <HI>Merope,</HI> we find a Letter to <HI>Maffei</HI> (the Author of an <HI>Italian</HI> Tragedy on the &s;ame Subject) in which that Writer, after mentioning a faulty Piece which was performed on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage; de|livers him&s;elf in the following Words. <HI>Elle fut &s;ans doute mal reque; mais n'e&s;t il pas bien etrange qu'on l'ait repre&s;entie? N'e&s;t ce pas une preuve que le Teatre</HI> Angloi&s;e <HI>n'e&s;t pas encore epur&eacute;? Il &s;emble que la m&eacute;me cau&s;e qui prive les</HI> Angloi&s;e <HI>du Genie de la Painture &amp; de la Mu&s;ique, leur &oacute;te au&s;&s;i celui de la Tragedie. Cette I&s;le, qui a produit les plus grand Philo&s;ophes de la Terre, n'e&s;t pas au&s;&s;i fertile pour les beaux Arts; &amp; &s;i les</HI> Anglois <HI>ne s'appliquent &s;erien&s;ement a &s;uivre les Preceptes de leurs excellens Citoyens</HI> Addi&s;on &amp; Pope, <HI>ils n'approcherent pas des autres Peuples en fait de Gout &amp; de Literature.</HI> <Q>The <HI>Engli&s;h Merope,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Voltaire,</HI>) acted in the Year 1731, was not well
<PB N="91" REF="94">received; but is it not &s;urpri&s;ing that it was exhibited at all? May we not infer from thence, that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Stage has not as yet attained a due Degree of Re|finement? It looks as if the &s;ame Cau&s;e, which has deprived the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of a Genius for Painting and Mu&s;ic, has al&s;o withheld from them the Spirit of Dra|matic Poetry. That I&s;land which has produced the greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers in the World, is not &s;o happy with Regard to the polite Arts, and unle&s;s they &s;e|riou&s;ly attach them&s;elves to the Precepts of their ex|cellent Countrymen, <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and <HI>Pope,</HI> they will be thrown at a Di&s;tance by other Nations in Point of Li|terature and Productions of Ta&s;te.</Q></P>
<P>Becau&s;e the Managers of a Theatre &s;uffered a bad Piece to be repre&s;ented, is it not unfair to derive from thence a Charge of Indelicacy upon a whole Nation, more particularly when the Reception this Piece met with from the Public is rather an Indication of a correct and ju&s;t Ta&s;te?&mdash;</P>
<P>What the Cau&s;e is, which has deprived the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of a Genius for Painting and Mu&s;ic, I am at a Lo&s;s to de|termine. Certain it is, tho&s;e Arts flouri&s;hed for a long Time in <HI>Italy,</HI> before they came over the <HI>Alps</HI> to our northern Regions; and it is certain that a Ta&s;te for them has prevailed many Years &s;ince in this Kingdom. They have been cultivated here with the greate&s;t Delicacy by &s;everal eminent Ma&s;ters, though we cannot boa&s;t as many exalted Geniu&s;&s;es as have adorned the &s;ofter Clime of <HI>Italy.</HI> The Transfiguration by <HI>Raphael,</HI> the Nativity by <HI>Corregio,</HI> and the la&s;t Judgment by <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> will perhaps never be matched any where el&s;e; but it is un|fair to deduce a Conclu&s;ion from thence, that we have no Genius for this excellent imitative Art in <HI>England.</HI> Portrait-Painting has been in as great a Degree of Per|fection in this Country as in any other Part of the World. Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI> found &s;o much Ta&s;te among us, that he made this his own Country; and here&mdash;
<PB N="92" REF="95">
<Q><L>Lely <HI>on animated Canvas &s;tole</HI></L>
<L><HI>The &s;leepy Eye, which &s;poke the melting Soul.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>But not to &s;neak from living worth to dead,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> finely expre&s;&s;es it, whoever, has ob&s;erved with Attention the Performances of <HI>Hayman,</HI> mu&s;t be con|vinced that <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s Charge of a Want of Ta&s;te is perfectly groundle&s;s. Every Thing is put out of Hand by this excellent Arti&s;t with the utmo&s;t Grace and Delicacy, and his Hi&s;tory-Pieces have, be&s;ides their beautiful Colouring, the mo&s;t lively Expre&s;&s;ion of Cha|racter. <HI>Hut&s;on</HI>'s Rooms teem with mimic Life; and <HI>Hogarth,</HI> like a true Genius, has formed a new School of Painting for him&s;elf. He may be truly &s;tiled the <HI>Cervantes</HI> of his Art, as he has exhibited the ridiculous Follies of human Nature with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Hu|mour, and he may be &s;aid to be the fir&s;t, who has wrote Comedy with his Pencil. His <HI>Harlot's Progre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Marriage A-la mode</HI> are, in my Opinion, as well drawn as any Thing in <HI>Moliere,</HI> and the Unity of Character, which is the Perfection of Dramatic Poetry, is &s;o &s;kilfully pre&s;erved, that we are &s;urprized to &s;ee the &s;ame Per&s;onage thinking agreeably to his complexional Ha|bits in the many different Situations, in which we after|wards perceive him. The Frible, the Bully, the Poli|tician, the Lawyer, the Mi&s;er, and in &s;hort all the &s;trik|ing Characters in Life are, by this Gentleman, &s;o ad|mirably depicted upon Canvas, that I am convinced <HI>Voltaire</HI> would be at a Lo&s;s to &s;hew where he has been equalled by any of his Countrymen.&mdash;</P>
<P>We may al&s;o boa&s;t an equal Excellence in Mu&s;ic; for though Mr. <HI>Handell</HI> is not an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> it is however a convincing Proof of our national Ta&s;te, that we have made it worth his while to fix his Re&s;idence among us, and that we have &s;hewn a due Sen&s;ibility to manly Me|lody, where the Sound is expre&s;&s;ive of the Sen&s;e, and where no unnatural Divi&s;ions, nor idle in&s;ignificant
<PB N="93" REF="96">Quirks mi&s;lead the Ear in a thrilling Maze of wild and and random Notes. It is owing to the Encouragement we have afforded this Gentleman, that we can now boa&s;t the noble&s;t and mo&s;t rational Mu&s;ic in the World. Be|&s;ides, &s;uch a Genius as Doctor <HI>Boyce</HI> will be always &s;uf|ficient to vindicate us from <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s national Oppro|brium, and the Admirers of <HI>Arne</HI> have con&s;tantly cele|brated him for his peculiar Talent, at finding the mo&s;t emphatic Expre&s;&s;ion in a Compo&s;ition, and di&s;covering where the Pa&s;&s;ions are placed in every Piece of Poetry. To the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages he never fails to give their full Energy, and like a ravi&s;hing Commentator he brings new Beauties into Light with &s;uch a Sweetne&s;s of Harmony, that every Brea&s;t yields irre&s;i&s;tibly to the melting Impre&s;&s;ion. I am proud to have an Opportunity of &s;aying that we are likely to have an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Opera &s;et to Mu&s;ic by the la&s;t mentioned Gentleman, which, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, will do Honour to him and his Country.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Time, when the above E&s;&s;ay was wrote, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> a Pupil of Mr. <HI>Handell</HI>'s, has di&s;played a noble Genius for mu&s;ical Compo&s;ition, and the Succe&s;s, which his Opera, called the <HI>Fairies,</HI> met with on <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Stage, at once gives lu&s;tre to his Merit, and is a Proof of the public Ta&s;te.</NOTE></P>
<P>With Regard to Dramatic Poetry, our Advantage over every Nation in the known World is, I think, very apparent. The be&s;t Critics have laid it down as a Rule that a Performance is to be judged by its Number of &s;triking Beauties, and not by &s;ome Inaccuracies, and the In&s;tances of occa&s;ional Conformity to the vicious Ta&s;te of the Times. If <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is viewed in this light he will certainly appear to any unprejudiced Rea|der infinitely &s;uperior to <HI>Corneille, Racine,</HI> and all the poli&s;hed Writers of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> I remember a Pa&s;|&s;age in <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s Writings, where he is at infinite Pains to bring together a String of Quotations from the be&s;t <HI>French</HI> Tragedies to evince their great Talents for the &s;ublime; in all he makes up about twenty or thirty at
<PB N="94" REF="97">mo&s;t; and the Beauties of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> have of late been publi&s;hed in &s;everal Volumes. Be&s;ides, <HI>Otway</HI> has found Acce&s;s to the Heart better than any <HI>French Writer</HI> what|ever, and the dome&s;tic Pa&s;&s;ions are touched by him with the greate&s;t Elegance and Simplicity. It is very common on the <HI>French</HI> Stage to hear a Per&s;onage of the Drama, exclaiming perpetually <HI>Helas,</HI> and <HI>mon Dicu!</HI> and then formally acquainting the Audience that he feels &s;uch and &s;uch Sen&s;ations; but our great Ma&s;ters of the Pa&s;&s;ions make their Hearers feel by Sympathy the Agitations of their Hero's Brea&s;t, without running into cold languid Declamation.</P>
<P>The Dramatic Poetry of this Country is like our Con|&s;titution, built upon the bold Ea&s;is of Liberty; and though the latter has brought our King to the Block, and the former admits Blood to be &s;hed on the Stage; the&s;e are Corruptions which have intruded, and are, as the Poets &s;ays,
<Q><HI>Effects unhappy from a noble Cau&s;e.</HI></Q> Upon the whole, we may apply, what <HI>Horace</HI> has &s;aid to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation,
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;Spirat Tragicum &s;atis, &amp; feliciter audet</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sed turpem putat in Chartis metuitque lituram.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Our Poets are &s;ufficiently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Spirit of Tragedy, but they are not attentive to the minute Rules of correct Ta&s;te, and the Trouble of blotting. It may be added, that they have more real Fire, &s;ublimer Sen|timents, and Characters better marked than any Nation whatever; and with regard to Painting and Mu&s;ic, we can boa&s;t &s;o many Ma&s;ters in both as might have pre|vented the <HI>French</HI> Author from charging us with a Want of Genius, and Ta&s;te for the fine Arts.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this Paper, without ob&s;erving, that it is a very particular Plea&s;ure to me, to find the Subject, on which I have been hitherto offering &s;ome &s;cattered Reflections, touched upon with great Spirit by a Writer of acknowledged Genius.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Gathric.</HI></NOTE> In a Preface to
<PB N="93" REF="98">a Novel called the FRIENDS, he has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with great Warmth, and a noble national Jealou&s;y. After mentioning that <HI>Voltaire</HI> calls his Countrymen, THE ABSOLUTE LEGISLATORS OF ALL THE FINE ARTS IN EUROPE, "how &s;hamele&s;s," &s;ays he, <Q>is this A&s;&s;er|tion in the Face of a Country, that gave Bread to <HI>Holben,</HI> Dignities to <HI>Reubens,</HI> and Encouragement to <HI>Vandike;</HI> and that for Years before (even by this Writer's own Acknowledgment) the national Ta&s;te of <HI>France</HI> was formed! While that Ta&s;te was barbarous, <HI>John&s;on</HI> enriched his native Tongue with Comedies, wrought up to more than <HI>Terentian</HI> Regularity and Propriety, in point of Conduct; and while <HI>France</HI> was ignorant of almo&s;t every Order of Architecture, <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> was rearing Hou&s;es, and projecting Palaces which all the boa&s;ted Improve|ments of <HI>France,</HI> in that Art, have not yet equalled. I &s;hall forbear to urge the Examples of <HI>Spencer</HI> or <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> becau&s;e I am firmly and &s;eriou&s;ly of Opi|nion, that no <HI>Frenchman</HI> ever yet was able (&s;uppo&s;ing him to under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> equally as <HI>French</HI>) to ta&s;te the Beauties of either of the&s;e Poets. For the Truth of this, I appeal to every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s Sen&s;e, who has had the Misfortune to read the unwilling, &s;canty, &s;tarved and mi&s;taken Encomiums, that <HI>Voltaire</HI> has be&s;towed on <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Is it not rather too charitable in the Author of the foregoing Pa&s;&s;age to &s;uppo&s;e Mon&s;ieur <HI>Voltaire</HI>'s re&s;erved Prai&s;es of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> could ari&s;e only from an Inability of reli&s;hing his Beauties? For my Part, I mu&s;t avow it, the <HI>French</HI> Writer appears to me capable of feeling every Stroke of our great Poet, but Envy, and a vain Ambition of erecting him&s;elf into an imagined Superiority, have rendered him open and explicit in his Abu&s;es, and he|&s;itating and frigid in his Commendations. But to con|clude; what <HI>Virgil</HI> has given away from his Country|men, we claim for ours. None better &s;hall inform the
<PB N="96" REF="99">breathing Bra&s;s, or &s;often Marble into mimic Features; none &s;hall better plead, or with equal Sagacity de&s;cribe the Motions of the planetary Sy&s;tem, and the Laws of Nature; and be&s;ides, it &s;hall be our further Prai&s;e to &s;pare a vanqui&s;hed Foe, and to check the Encroachments of an intriguing, faithle&s;s, perfidious Enemy, ever re&s;t|le&s;s and aiming at an univer&s;al Monarchy, which, it is to be hoped, the Councils and Arms of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will for ever hold from them.</P>

<P>THE Tragedy of <HI>Richard the Third</HI> was performed here lately, and as there were many Circum&s;tances in the Battle, which was fought in the fifth Act, quite un|known to the Audience, it may not be improper to give &s;ome Account of that Engagement. The Theatrical Cock had done Salutation to the Morn, and <HI>Richard</HI> had ani|mated the Soldiery, when the Attack was begun on the Left-Wing, under the Command of the Lord High <HI>Con|&s;table Grey.</HI> This Impre&s;&s;ion was received by General <HI>Raf|tor,</HI> who ordered the Woods to be &s;cowered, but the Enemy &s;etting up the War-hoop, he was repul&s;ed into the Green-Room, where he rallied his Spirits and his Forces, and again returned to the Charge. Upon this the Fight was renewed with great Alacrity, and continued very ob|&s;tinate, until a general De&s;olation &s;tretched the greate&s;t Part of the Combatants upon the Scene of Action. Upon this occa&s;ion General <HI>Raftor</HI> fell greatly lamented, and (if we may be allowed to imitate <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI>) the &s;ame Ab&s;ence of Pa&s;&s;ion, for which he was remarkable while living, was legible in his Countenance. Lord High Con&s;table <HI>Grey</HI> was overpowered by Numbers, and his Body was taken up, far from his Friends, among fallen Heaps of the Enemy, &s;till breathing &s;hort, and clinching his Staff with the &s;ame Eagerne&s;s he had done all his
<PB N="97" REF="100">Life. Lieutenant General <HI>Mar</HI> fell much lamented. We cannot at pre&s;ent furni&s;h an exact Account of the Lo&s;s on either Side, but the Mu&s;ter-Roll, which has been handed to us, &s;tands as follows,

<P>_I LATELY met with a Fable, in a <HI>French</HI> Writer, which I thought, carried with it a great Deal of Propriety, and, though it was rather eked out, as is &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e among the livelie&s;t Geniu&s;&s;es of that Country, beyond the ju&s;t Limits pre&s;cribed by the Matter con|tained in it, it was however conducted with &s;uch a Pret|tine&s;s of Fancy and Expre&s;&s;ion, that I was very much entertained with the Peru&s;al of it. Poetry, (&s;ays my Author) is the Son of the God of <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> and the God|de&s;s of <HI>Meditation.</HI> He bears in his Appearance &s;uch a &s;trong Re&s;emblance to the&s;e his Parents, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible, to mi&s;take the Marks of his Legitimacy, and
<PB N="98" REF="101">therefore, whenever the&s;e Proofs of his Birth are de|ficient, we may with Rea&s;on conclude him to be of a &s;purious Breed.</P>
<P>From his Father, he derives his apparent Indolence, his Serenity, his graceful Elocution, and his unlaboured Turn of Thought, together with his elegant Feli|city in all his Compo&s;itions; a remarkable Neglect of the ordinary U&s;es of Life, a Di&s;regard for Riches, and a total Ab&s;ence of all worldly Ambition, &s;ave what is in&s;pired by Virtue and hone&s;t Fame, are his di|&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;tics. From his Mother, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es his Mode&s;ty, which makes him not very fond of obtruding him&s;elf into Company; his pen&s;ive Air, which inclines him to be always enforcing &s;ome Precept of Morality, or &s;ome Topic which may be &s;ub&s;ervient to the U&s;e or Enjoyment of Life; his Love of Solitude, which induces him to &s;hun Crowds and great Cities, and leads him into rural Scenes, where he may give free Scope to his Imagi|nation undi&s;turbed by the Cares and Anxieties of Life. The &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition in his Temper renders him not very fond of being known by the Bulk of Mankind, that he may prevent the Inconveniencies attendant on him when his Affairs require that he &s;hould make his Appearance in Public. If he puts any thing abroad into the World, and thinks proper to publi&s;h the Re|&s;ult of his contemplative Moments, he does not like to be pointed at by the Multitude, but chu&s;es to receive the Tribute of Applau&s;e, obtained by his Writings, without being liable to the Sarca&s;ms, the Taunts, and malevolent Je&s;ts, which are always the &s;ure Concomi|tants of Prai&s;e, and which are generally a very great Di&s;count upon his Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Motives he is enamoured with Retirement, and he is further confirmed in his &s;eque&s;tred State by a Con&s;ideration, that the more he keeps him&s;elf at a
<PB N="99" REF="102">Di&s;tance from the Re&s;t of Mankind, the more Beau|ties they are willing to de&s;cry in his Productions; in like Manner as the Hills, and the remote Parts of a Pro&s;pect pre&s;ent a more vivid Green, than when our Advances to them have brought the Scene more clo&s;e to our In&s;pection, and the Heath, the craggy Rock, and ploughed Land, are familiari&s;ed to the naked Eye.</P>
<P>This is the Sub&s;tance of the Fable; the Meaning that it inculcates is certainly very ju&s;t and obvious. The be&s;t Writers in all Ages have &s;ub&s;cribed to it, and the mo&s;t applauded of the antient Poets are con&s;tantly offering warm Pictures of rural Imagery to our Ima|ginations; they &s;eem to be &s;tifled with Du&s;t and Smoke, when they mention a City-Life, and we frequently &s;ind them expatiating with Rapture upon the Plea&s;ures of a Country-Life, which they look upon to be the Nur&s;e of Thought, and the only Sphere in which their Studies can be pro&s;ecuted with any Degree of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation will hold good with Regard to all Kinds of Writing, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e excellent Productions of the Pre&s;s which make their Appearance under the various Shapes of <HI>Newgate</HI>-Memoirs, New's-Papers, and political Pamphlets. In Works that call for a long Train of Rea&s;oning, &s;ubtile Di&s;qui&s;itions, and unwearied Application, undoubtedly the proper Place to accompli&s;h them, is in tho&s;e Regions, where Riot and Debauchery are Strangers; where Gaming, Drinking, and idle Amu&s;ements of all Sorts are un|known, and where, above all, Health and Cheerfulne&s;s add new Lu&s;tre to the Face of Things.</P>
<P>It may perhaps &s;eem a Paradox, if I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that, among all the Gentlemen of the Quill, there is not one, to whom Solitude and Ea&s;e are more nece&s;&s;ary than the periodical Writer; but though his Compo|&s;itions are generally comprized in a narrow Com|pa&s;s, and though he does not, for the mo&s;t Part,
<PB N="100" REF="103">pretend to &s;earch every Subject to the Bottom; though it is not expected of him to lay before the Reader deep, philo&s;ophical Speculations, ab&s;tracted Rea&s;onings, and new Sy&s;tems of Morality and Religion; yet, in my Apprehen&s;ion, it will be found, upon an attentive Survey of his Situation, that it is particularly incumbent on the Adventurer in this Way, to withdraw him&s;elf from the Bu&s;tle of Mankind, and to appear, as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible in little Circles at Coffee-hou&s;es, convivial Clubs at Taverns, and the long Train of public Places, which &s;erve no other Purpo&s;e in this Metropolis than merely to kill Time, as the Phra&s;e is, and to hurry a Per&s;on into a Cour&s;e of Vanity and Di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>There is a Pa&s;&s;age in Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> which I have ever peru&s;ed with Admiration, becau&s;e it &s;hews him to have been a Man of the mo&s;t prudent Under&s;tanding, as well as the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Poet; Two Adjuncts which are &s;eldom found to coexi&s;t.</P>
<Q><L><HI>I ne'er with Wits, and Witlings pa&s;s'd my Days,</HI></L>

<P>Perhaps too great a Tincture of Pride runs through the&s;e Lines, for any one el&s;e to make Application of them to him&s;elf. <HI>Pope</HI> had Talents &s;uperior to al|mo&s;t all Mankind, but if a more humble Writer can|not withdraw him&s;elf from our pre&s;ent Town-Smarts and Critics, like an Ea&s;tern Monarch, he may at lea&s;t accompli&s;h it, like <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Friend in his third Satire,

<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, my Readers may think the&s;e Tenets incon&s;i&s;tent with the Character of <HI>Ranger;</HI> but airy and gay as <HI>Ranger</HI> may appear, he is now perfectly aver&s;e to the wild Sallies of his Name&s;ake in the Play: He would not chu&s;e to &s;tagger home from a Box and Dice in the Morning, nor to get through a Window into an hone&s;t Gentleman's Hou&s;e at Night; he can|not run after every white Apron he &s;ees, nor keep Company with a Set of Fellows whom he de&s;pi&s;es. And yet there are Di&s;&s;ipations to which a Re&s;ident in Town is for ever liable; add to the&s;e, the Danger attendant on a Writer's making him&s;elf known in too many Quarters of the Town. Prejudices are ever apt to ari&s;e again&s;t an Author, who does not take care to conceal him&s;elf. The Tran&s;ition is &s;o quick from the Performance to the Per&s;on who produced it, that from the Moment a Man begins to publi&s;h, he is enli&s;ted into a State of Warfare with almo&s;t all the Critics and <HI>Malevoli</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>Some Readers have no Criterion, by which to judge of a Production, except the Rules of Phy&s;iognomy; and if an Author appears younger than them&s;elves, they hold it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to receive any In&s;truction from him. It is, by the Way, &s;omewhat &s;trange that this experienced Cla&s;s will not allow a Man to be &s;it to entertain them, until his Imagination begins to flag, his Invention to clo&s;e, like Flowers at the Setting of the Sun, his Memory to decay, and his Wit, if he have any Share of it, to become &s;low and tardy. This however, is what is de&s;ired by the Man who would look an Author in the Teeth to know his Age, and from thence make an E&s;timate of his Merit.</P>

<P>_AS the late Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s Works have come abroad into the World with all the Pomp of a &s;uperb Edition, and as Part of them, by being addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> may be thought to co-incide with his religious Tenets, I have jugded it not improper to lay before my Readers, &s;ome Particulars relating to this Matter, which I lately met with in a Volume of the ingenious <HI>Racine.</HI> That excellent <HI>French</HI> Author had, it &s;eems, given vent to &s;ome Animadver&s;ions on Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> and the Con&s;equence was, that our great Poet, unea&s;y at the Reflection, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert his Sy&s;tem, in a Letter to the <HI>French</HI> Writer, which he inclo&s;ed to the celebrated Chevalier <HI>Ram&s;ay.</HI> This Corre&s;pondence will throw a Light on <HI>Pope</HI>'s Way of Thinking in re|ligious Matters, and will evidently &s;hew that he was far from embracing <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s Principles.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS highly plea&s;ed, and do not doubt but you will be plea&s;ed al&s;o, at the Receipt of a Letter which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has &s;ent me to be forwarded to you. You will perceive by the Contents, that it was not with|out ju&s;t Grounds, I undertook, in a former Letter, to ju&s;tify the Principles of my illu&s;trious Countryman. My Vindication of him might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;u&s;pected to have its Source in Friend&s;hip; and therefore lo&s;e great|ly of its Strength. But here, Sir, he pleads his own Defence; his Letter will demon&s;trate to you his Zeal for Religion, and it is to be hoped, will &s;ilence his Ac|cu&s;ers. You will find it accompanied by a Defence of his Sy&s;tem, written by Mr. <HI>Warburton,</HI> a celebrated Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> by di&s;tributing this Performance among&s;t his Friends, adopts the Doctrine, approves the Sentiments, and thereby gives to the whole an additional Value.</P>
<P>The Opinion, which you conceived of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> is on your Side very excu&s;able. You received the Im|pre&s;&s;ion from the Mi&s;repre&s;entations of his Enemies, for many Enemies he has. <HI>Urit enim fulgero &s;uo,</HI> &amp;c. His &s;uperior Talents have excited a great deal of Envy towards his Per&s;on, and his Connections with &s;everal eminent Per&s;onages, all engaged in oppo&s;ite Intere&s;ts, or attached to the Court, have further &s;erved to inflame the Minds of Men again&s;t him. But there are many evincing Proofs of his Probity, and the Incorruptibility of his Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110">I have been informed, that he was in Intimacy with &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Mini&s;ters, and often with many at the &s;ame Time. Thus circum&s;tanced, it would have been ea&s;y for him to create a large Fortune, had he availed him&s;elf of the Di&s;grace of one Party, in order to recommend him&s;elf to the other. But he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a Soul &s;uperior to &s;uch mean Artifices.</P>
<P>My Intelligence adds further, that the Queen, who was an Admirer of his Genius, expre&s;&s;ed an Inclination to employ him, without requiring any Thing further of him than a di&s;&s;embled Conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of his Country, promi&s;ing, at the &s;ame Time, to di&s;pen&s;e with the Strictne&s;s of the Oath u&s;ually ad|mini&s;tered upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions But Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was in|acce&s;&s;ible to Temptation, which may &s;erve to prove he was directed by other Principles than tho&s;e of a Sceptic or a Dei&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that I am not induced to this Ta&s;k by &s;upererogatory Friend&s;hip to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> nor am I willing to offer him the Incen&s;e of Adulation. I mean &s;olely to &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Truth and Ju&s;tice, and am,</P>

<P>THE Expectation, in which I have been for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, of receiving the Pre&s;ent you have honoured me with, was the Occa&s;ion of my delaying &s;o long to an&s;wer your Letter.

My Uneafine&s;s met &s;ome Alleviation, from a Pa&s;&s;age in
<PB N="108" REF="111">your Preface, where you declare your Inability, from a Want of Knowledge of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, to give your own Judgment on the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man;</HI> you add, that you do not controvert my Tenets, but the evil Con&s;equences deducible from them, and the Drift of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in my Poem, which Per&s;ons of notable Sagacity imagine they have di&s;covered. This Decla|ration is a &s;hining Proof of your Candor, your Di&s;cre|tion and your Charity. I mu&s;t take Leave to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that your Unacquaintance with the Original has not proved more fatal to me, than the imperfect Con|ceptions of my Tran&s;lators, who have not &s;ufficiently informed them&s;elves of my real Sentiments. Though the many additional Embelli&s;hments, which my Piece has received from the elegant Ver&s;ion of <HI>M. D.

The&s;e Mi&s;takes you will perceive are totally refuted in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Piece, which I have tran&s;mitted to you.

<P>In the mean Time I &s;hall not he&s;itate to declare my|&s;elf very cordially in Regard to &s;ome Particulars, about which you have de&s;ired an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t avow then openly and &s;incerely, that my Principles are diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Sentiments of <HI>Spinoza</HI> and <HI>Leibuitz;</HI> they are perfectly coincident with the Tenets of <HI>M.

<P>THE Mildne&s;s and Humility, with which you ju&s;tify your&s;elf, is a convincing Proof of your Religion; the more &s;o, as you have done it to one, on whom it is incumbent to make his own Apology for his ra&s;h Attack upon your Character. Your Manner of pardoning me is the more delicate, as it is done without any Mixture of Reproach; but though you acquit me with &s;o much Politene&s;s, I &s;hall not &s;o ea&s;ily forgive my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Certain it is, a Precipitance of Zeal hurried me away. As I had often heard Po&s;itions &s;aid to be yours, or at lea&s;t Con&s;equences re&s;ulting from your E&s;&s;ay, cited again&s;t certain Truths (which I now find you re&s;pect as much as my&s;elf) I thought, I had a Right to enter the Li&s;ts with you. The Pa&s;&s;age, in my Preface, was extorted from me by a Degree of Remor&s;e, which I felt in writing again&s;t you. This Remor&s;e, Sir, was awakened in me by the Con&s;ideration, that the greate&s;t Men are always the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of the Truths of Revelation. I was really grieved to think that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould oppo&s;e a Religion, who&s;e Enemies have ever been contemptible, and it appeared &s;trange, that in a Work which points out the Road to Happine&s;s, you &s;hould furni&s;h Arms to tho&s;e, who are indu&s;trious to mi&s;guide us in the Re&s;earch.</P>
<P>Your Letter, at the &s;ame Time that it does Honour to your Character, mu&s;t bring a Blu&s;h in my Face, for having entertained unju&s;t Su&s;picions; but, notwith|&s;tanding this, I think my&s;elf obliged to make it public; the Injury which I have done you, was &s;o, the Repa|ration

<P>Whatever may be urged in your Favour in the Commentary you have &s;ent me, it is now rendered un|nece&s;&s;ary by your own Declaration. The Re&s;pect, which you avow for Religion, is a &s;ufficient Vindica|tion of your Doctrine; I will add, that for the Future, tho&s;e among us, who &s;hall feel the laudable Ambition of making their Poetry &s;ub&s;ervient to Re|ligion, ought to take you for their Model, and it &s;hould ever be remembred, that the greate&s;t Poet, in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> is one of the humble&s;t Sons of the Church.

<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t, the Audience here was agreeably &s;urprized with the Appearance of a new Actre&s;s, in the Character of <HI>Hermione,</HI> and after the Play, it was un|animou&s;ly agreed, that it was a mo&s;t admirable fir&s;t At|tempt. Mrs. <HI>Gregory,</HI> who performed the Part, came on without any of tho&s;e previous Notices, commonly called <HI>Puffs,</HI> to prejudice the Town in her Favour, tho' it &s;oon was manife&s;t, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Materials of a great Actre&s;s. She is happy in a graceful Dignity of Deportment, natural and &s;en&s;ible Elocution, and in &s;hort, the Character was &s;o well &s;u&s;tained, throughout the Play, that &s;he was allowed the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Figure in every Scene, tho' performing with experienced Players; which is certainly &s;uch a Degree of Merit, as cannot fail to render her a &s;hining Ornament of the Stage.</P>

<P>_I WAS &s;urprized the other Day to receive a Letter, which, by the Po&s;t-mark it bore, appeared to come from the Height of a <HI>Caledonian</HI> Mountain. I could not con|ceive who &s;hould addre&s;s me from that Part of the World; but upon opening it, I found it &s;ub&s;cribed by my Friend the <HI>Second Sighted Scotchman,</HI> who formerly entertained my Readers with his <HI>News for one Hundred Years hence.</HI> I received his Epi&s;tle with that Plea&s;ure, which I always feel in hearing from an hone&s;t Man, and, as I am in Hopes that the Contents of his Packet will not be found di&s;agreeable, I &s;hall lay the whole, without any further Preface, before my Readers, taking only the Liberty to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Parts of his Letter, as &s;eem rather a Compliment to my&s;elf, than in any Way relative to the Public.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>Extract of a Letter from a</HI> Second Sighted Scotchman, <HI>dated</HI> December 15, 1753.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we have had a Share, by our joint En|deavours, in obtaining a Repeal of the <HI>Jew-Bill,</HI> affords me muckle Content, but notwith&s;tanding this Suc|ce&s;s, there is &s;till another Matter that has purturbed my Spirits for &s;ome Time pa&s;t. I believe, I need nottell one of Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s quick Penetration, that I mean the <HI>Mar|riage-Act,</HI> which, I make no Doubt, was de&s;igned for very good and laudable Purpo&s;es, but will mo&s;t certainly, in its Con&s;equences, prove of the utmo&s;t Detriment to this
<PB N="113" REF="116">Nation, and be the final Ruin of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility. I already &s;ee them dwindling by Degrees into an emaciated, puny, &s;ickly Race; and let me tell you, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> it cannot be otherwi&s;e, if, for the fu|ture, they are only to marry among one another, without any po&s;&s;ible Means of improving the Breed by a Mix|ture of whole&s;ome Fle&s;h and Blood. To what a wretched State <HI>England</HI> may be reduced, I have lately had an Opportunity of ob&s;erving in &s;ome Scenes that were really very affecting. As I was &s;ojourning upon the Height of a <HI>Caledonian</HI> Mountain, the Air was &s;uddenly rarified to a greater Degree of Purity than u&s;ual, and &s;uch Openings of Futurity were di&s;clo&s;ed to me, that I am even now &s;hocked at the Reflection. As I was formerly taught the Rudiments of Humanity, and in&s;tructed to indite a Letter, by my Friend Mr. <HI>M'Gregor,</HI> a worthy <HI>Philomath</HI> of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> I re&s;olved to lo&s;e no Time, but to &s;end the Particulars of my Vi&s;ion to my Friend <HI>Ranger;</HI> and this too I have done, as I did upon the former Occa&s;ion, in the Form of a New's-Paper, which I am &s;ure will be the Stile of the Times.</P>

<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t arrived in Town, being returned from his Travels, the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Pentweazle,</HI> of rare Accompli&s;hments, and very pro|mi&s;ing Genius.

<P>Ye&s;terday came on, at the Sittings in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Hall,</HI> a very remarkable Hearing, in a Cau&s;e mentioned in our la&s;t, upon a Petition from <HI>George Beverly,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Minor who is not to be of Age until his Twenty-fifth
<PB N="114" REF="117">Year, complaining, that his Guardians have hindered him from performing a Contract of Marriage with Mi&s;s <HI>Maria Healthy,</HI> a beautiful young Lady of a moderate Fortune.

<P>By the la&s;t Mail from <HI>Ireland,</HI> we have Advice, that as &s;oon as his Grace the Duke of <HI>Slender-Shanks,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, landed on <HI>George</HI>'s Key, the Croud, that was gathered on the Occa&s;ion, all bur&s;t into a loud Fit of Laughter, crying out, <HI>"Arrah, but "is that he.</HI></P>
<P>We can a&s;&s;ure our Readers, that the Managers of both Play-hou&s;es have re&s;olved to fit up the Boxes with Stoves, to prevent the Complaint of their being too cold for People of Quality, who have &s;uffered great Inconve|niencies for Want of this Accommodation of late Years.</P>
<P>La&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night, as the Lords <HI>Scrophulous</HI> and <HI>Spindle</HI> were returning home from the <HI>Burletta</HI> in a <HI>Vis-a-vis</HI> Sedan-Chair, the Chair-men, walking in a violent Hurry, gave &s;uch a violent Motion to the Car|riage, that the two young Lords were both thrown out of their Seats, and both their Heads were unfortunate|ly knocked together.

<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t was reviewed upon <HI>Putney-Common</HI> the Fir&s;t Regiment of Guards, by the Honourable Sir <HI>Robert Lungs,</HI> who, was hand&s;omely mounted upon an ea&s;y Pad, &s;ent to him as a Pre&s;ent from the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert</HI> was in great Spirits, and wore a white Hand|kerchief about his Neck.</P>

<P>THE Company were entertained, Ye&s;terday Evening, by a Di&s;pute between the Doctors OPIUM and SNAKEROOT, upon the Que&s;tion whether Preaching or Playing is of the greate&s;t Service to a Chri&s;tian Community. Doctor SNAKEROOT thought pro|per to declare that though he had not &s;een the In&s;ide of a Church any Time the&s;e fifteen Years pa&s;t, yet, unle&s;s the Method of exhibiting was different from what it u&s;ed to be, when he was taken to tho&s;e Places by his Grand|mother, he could not po&s;&s;ibly conceive what could be the Advantage of frequenting them. Doctor OPIUM, not a little picqued at this Declaration, thought pro|per on his Part to mention that he knew as little of what pa&s;&s;ed within the Walls of the Church as the
<PB N="117" REF="120">other; but out of Re&s;pect to many reverend Digni|taries, who were his extreme good Patients, he could not help thinking, that tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, under proper Management, might be rendered a tolerable in&s;tructive Amu&s;ement. <Q>I grant you, (replied <HI>Snakeroot)</HI> if the Managers would pay &s;ome little Deference to the public Ta&s;te; and in the&s;e Ca&s;es it ought to be con&s;ulted, for it appears to me that Preaching and Playing had originally a pretty clo&s;e Affinity. Indeed I know nothing that can give a better Idea of the Simplicity of the antient Drama, which, without any Di&s;tinction of Scenes was divided into <HI>three Acts,</HI> reci|ted by one Per&s;on, and each of them clo&s;ed by a <HI>Chorus;</HI> and they were generally pre&s;ented upon &s;ome Fe&s;tival, in&s;tituted in Honour of the Deities; and as a further Proof, you know, Sir, (continued he) that in their Churches they &s;till retain the Word. <HI>Pulpit,</HI> which the <HI>Greek</HI> Writers made u&s;e of to &s;ignify a Stage.</Q> Doctor OPIUM was going to reply when his Di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by the Appearance of Mr. HARTSHORN, the Apothecary, who ha&s;tily came up and for about five Minutes buried his No&s;e in the Periwig of the &s;aid Doctor. A Con&s;ultation was then held by the &s;aid Doctor OPIUM, the &s;aid Mr. HARTSHORN, and the &s;aid Doctor OPIUM'S Cane; when they all three withdrew together, and left Doctor SNAKEROOT in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Argument.</P>

<P>_THE Chambers over my Apartment in <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI> having been unoccupied for a con&s;iderable Time pa&s;t, I was enabled to pur&s;ue my Lu|cubrations with the greater Ea&s;e and Tran|quillity, being free from tho&s;e &s;udden Alarms of Noi&s;e, which are otherwi&s;e inevitable in any of the Inns of Court. But my Repo&s;e has met with an Interruption of &s;o plea&s;ant a Kind, that I have determined to acquaint my Readers with all the Particulars of the Incident.</P>
<P>About ten Days &s;ince, a Gentleman entered upon the Premi&s;es, and ever &s;ince I have been frequently di&s;turbed, when at my Studies, by &s;uch quick and unexpected Shocks, that it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to pur|&s;ue the &s;ame Train of Thought with any Degree of At|tention. As I was Ye&s;terday-Morning peru&s;ing Mr. <HI>Hawkins Brown</HI>'s excellent Poem upon the Immortality of the Soul, in which he has artfully combined in their full Force all the Arguments in Support of that impor|tant Article of our Belief, &s;uddenly I heard a violent Bounce over my Head; the Cieling &s;hook as if ready to come down, and a Convul&s;ion &s;hook the whole Hou&s;e. Deep Contemplation &s;ometimes unbraces the Nerves to &s;uch a Degree, that an unexpected Noi&s;e &s;tartles the whole Frame of the Body, and throws the Spirits out of that placid State, which is requi&s;ite in order to think with Calmne&s;s and Per&s;picuity. This Di&s;compo&s;ure I experienced upon &s;o many Occa&s;ions, and &s;ometimes in
<PB N="119" REF="122">&s;uch quick Succe&s;&s;ion, that I judged it proper to &s;tep up Stairs to the Gentleman, to inform him of the Incon|veniencies, which I lay under, and to beg of him to manage his Affairs for the future with le&s;s Turbulence.</P>
<P>I knocked two or three Times at his Door, but re|ceiving no An&s;wer, and hearing him run about with great Violence of Exertion, I made bold to walk in unbid. You go into the Dining-Room through a Gla&s;s-Folding-Door, which was at this Time &s;hut, but the Curtains undrawn. Through the Window, I &s;aw the Gentleman pulling off his Cloaths with the utmo&s;t Vehemence, and in an In&s;tant he appeared in the Ha|bit and Air, of an old Woman delivering Doctor <HI>Rock</HI>'s Bills upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill.</HI> Surprized at this Change, I &s;topt &s;hort to ob&s;erve the Actions of this extraordinary Per&s;onage, and very &s;hortly I was entertained with ano|ther Vici&s;&s;itude of Appearance; for, quick as Lighten|ing, he &s;hifted Cloaths, and walked about the Room with a Ba&s;ket, and with an audible Voice pronounced, <Q>Muf|fins for Coffee and Tea, Gentlemen and Ladies.</Q> This appeared extremely whim&s;ical; he then varied his Dre&s;s, and with a Silver Pipe cried out <HI>London-Evening Po&s;t:</HI> After which he threw away his Bundle of Papers, fall down upon his Knees, laid his Hand on his Heart, looked up with a great Expre&s;&s;ion of Joy, and then ri&s;ing, indulged him&s;elf in all the whim&s;ical Vagaries of a Man frantic with Sen&s;ations too exqui&s;ite to endure. In this Way he continued for &s;ome Time, and at length threw him&s;elf into an Attitude of Surprize; after which, he ran wild about the Room, like one almo&s;t di&s;tracted with De&s;pair, looking up in vain to Heaven for Relief, when to my great Amazement, he unexpectedly mu&s;tered up his Spirits, and with great Alacrity leaped through a &s;mall Aperture into the Coal-Hole. After ab&s;conding there for a &s;hort Space of Time, he came forth with a Sack of Coals upon his Shoulders, which he emptied in the Middle of the Room, calling with &s;ome Earne&s;t|ne&s;s,
<PB N="120" REF="123"><HI>"Below."</HI> He had no &s;ooner done this, but he directed his Eyes &s;parkling with Joy to &s;ome imaginary Object with which his Fancy &s;eemed to be highly plea&s;ed; He then came forward, and knocked at the Door, where I had taken my Station, which I then took an Opportunity to open, and as I was advancing towards him, he &s;eized me by the Shoulder, and twin|ing me round with all his Strength &s;ent me reeling into a Corner of his Room. Upon this, he walked into the outward Apartment, &s;lapping the Door after him, and immediately opened a &s;mall Ca&s;ement Window, which was over the Door of his Bed-Chamber. From thence he &s;tretched out his Neck, and looking me full in the Face, bur&s;t out into a loud Fit of Laughter; then pro|ducing a Squirt, he began to let fly at me in &s;uch a Manner, that I was &s;oon pretty well watered from Head to Foot. The Exclamations, which I vented upon this Occa&s;ion, rung &s;uch a Peal in the Gentleman's Ears, that he was brought to a Recollection of him&s;elf. He came down very lei&s;urely from his Po&s;t, and with a mode&s;t Air and genteel Addre&s;s he politely a&s;ked my Pardon, and told me that he was &s;o intent upon his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that he really did not perceive that he was offer|ing Indignities to a Stranger.&mdash;</P>
<P>Imagining that I was in the Hands of a Madman, I was willing to acquie&s;ce with his Apology, but to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, I took the Liberty to enquire of him, the Nature of his Bu&s;ine&s;s and what might be his Vocation. <Q>Sir, &s;aid the Gentleman, won't you plea&s;e to be &s;eated, With regard to my Bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, I am a Pantomime Poet&mdash;a Pantomime Poet!</Q>&mdash;<Q>Pray, Sir, what is a Pantomime Poet?</Q>&mdash;To this Que&s;tion my Friend an&s;wered with a Smile, <Q>a Writer of Pantomime, Sir. &mdash;It is a Plan which I have determined to apply my|&s;elf to, having Rea&s;on to think that it is the only Way of &s;ucceeding in the pre&s;ent Age. I was bred at <HI>Eton</HI> School, from whence at a proper Time I was re|moved
<PB N="121" REF="124">to the Univer&s;ity; at both which Places I laid in a &s;ufficient Store of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and always feeling a particular Turn for the Drama I applied my Genius principally to Tragedy and Comedy. In each Species of Writing I have given the fini&s;hing Hand to &s;ome Pieces which have received the Approbation of a few Gentlemen of known Ta&s;te and perfectly ver&s;ed in critical Matters. Encouraged by their Opinion I came to Town, and after a long tedious Application I find it impo&s;&s;ible to get any of my Performances ex|hibited. Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> has already, like a provident General, laid his Plan of Operations, and Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> is determined to bring on no new Pieces, until we have &s;uch a Genius as <HI>Tom Durfey</HI></Q> <HI>I wi&s;h Mr.&mdash;, &s;ays he, we had &s;uch another Writer now.</HI> <Q>On this Ac|count I have taken a Re&s;olution to cultivate a Species of the Drama, which cannot fail of being profitable to all Parties, and, being agreeable to the public Ta&s;te, will be brought on without Difficulty as &s;oon as offered.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Here I broke in upon the Thread of his Di&s;cour&s;e, by a&s;king if he was determined to become Harlequin him&s;elf? To this he an&s;wered me in the Negative; but as it is a Rule in Writing to place your&s;elf in the Situa|tion of the Character for which you are to find &s;uit|able Dialogue, he had judged it not improper to con|form to this Precept, and therefore, in order the better to concert the &s;udden E&s;capes and Changes of Dre&s;s, which have &s;o plea&s;ing an effect in this kind of Poetry, he was practi&s;ing over every &s;triking Attitude, and every unexpected Situation of the Harlequin, that he might be the better able to form an Opinion of the Plot and the &s;everal Incidents of the Marvellous, which he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce. He proceeded to inform me, that he purpo&s;ed calling his fir&s;t Piece HARLEQUIN TRIUMPHANT, or POETRY IN THE SUDS. In this Performance the whole Race of Authors are to be ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="125">to the Deri&s;ion of the Public, and Harlequin is to crack a very great Number of facetious Jokes upon their shoulders with his wooden Sword. A Poet is to be placed at a Table with a Beef-&s;take laid before him, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, when in an In&s;tant, by &s;ome cu|rious Stroke of Art, the &s;olid Sub&s;tance is to be changed into a modern Tragedy, and <HI>Calvert</HI>'s <HI>Entire Butt</HI> wafted away from his longing Eyes. The Bard after this is to be ducked in a Well, and then to&s;&s;ed dry in a Blanket, while Mother <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> enjoys the &s;prightly Vein of Mirth, happy to &s;ee her Orders &s;o faithfully executed. In &s;hort, the unhappy Poets are to undergo every Indig|nity that human Wit can invent; and in Contra&s;t to this, Harlequin is to riot in Luxury; the Spring is to pour fourth her fre&s;he&s;t Verdure to charm his Eye, Summer to ripen the various Fruits upon the loaded Boughs, in order to regale his Palate; Autumn mu&s;t admini&s;ter the circling Gla&s;s, and Winter expand the frozen Surface of the Waters for him to &s;kate with all his Dignity, in Sight of the a&s;toni&s;hed Audience.</P>
<P>Though this Plan appeared highly romantic to me at fir&s;t Sight, I could not help telling the Gentleman, that I made no doubt but he would find his Account in it. I told him, that the &s;ure&s;t Way to ri&s;e in the World was to gratify the Follies of the People, and therefore com|mended this Scheme, which I am convinced cannot fail of Succe&s;s. I ju&s;t then hinted, that if he could contrive to be le&s;s violent in his Studies, I &s;hould take it as a Fa|vour, and after a&s;&s;uring him of my &s;incere Wi&s;hes for all the Encouragement his Project de&s;erves, I took my leave, and am at pre&s;ent tolerably quiet in my Study, not hav|ing above two or three Alarms in a Day, which mu&s;t be now and then expected from &s;o vigorous and warm an Imagination.</P>

<P>_THE Sixth Book of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> has always been a Favourite with me, for the noble Sen|timents of Morality, and the inimitable Strain of Poetry which run through it. I frequently read it with the mo&s;t tran&s;porting Plea&s;ure, and, after fini&s;hing it, I cannot but look down very much upon the degenerate State of Poetry among the Moderns. For the &s;trong nervous Thought and natural Expre&s;&s;ion, they have &s;ub&s;tituted pretty Conceit, quaint Phra&s;es, Turns, Strokes, and I know not what, tending to a general De|pravity of Ta&s;te among us. Filled with the&s;e Thoughts, I lately retired to re&s;t, when <HI>Queen Mab</HI> immediately ap|peared to me, and from the Mixture of Ideas fluctuating in my Mind, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed up the following Scene to my Imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="128">I thought &s;he informed me, that the intellectual Re|gions are divided into Di&s;tricts &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Nether-world, &s;o admirably de&s;cribed by the Poet; I then fan&s;ied that &s;he commanded me to &s;et out on a Journey through the Head of a modern Writer, which, I in&s;tantly agreed to, and the Godde&s;s accordingly took me in her Chariot. In a &s;hort Time, we arrived at the Apartment, where the Bard &s;at, <HI>&s;icklied o'er with the pale Ca&s;t of Thought.</HI> At my fir&s;t Approach towards the intellectual Regions, a terrible Effluvium "proceeding," as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has it, "from the Heat-oppre&s;&s;ed Brain," &s;truck my Sen&s;es; but I was &s;oon diverted from that unea&s;y Sen&s;ation by a Per&s;onage, who offered to be my Guide. From a con&s;cious Simper, a carele&s;s Di&s;po&s;i|tion of his Per&s;on, and the Tenor of his Di&s;cour&s;e, I knew him to be VANITY, and accepted the Compli|ment. Our Way was through a thick Skull, of which we at once took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and plunged into the Aby&s;s.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t Entrance, a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e a&s;&s;ailed our Ears, and we were in&s;tantly be&s;et by a Number of Phan|toms placed around the Portal. The God <HI>Somnus</HI> lay &s;tretched at full Length, diffu&s;ing round him lethargic Vapours and &s;tupid In&s;en&s;ibility; a Group of wild <HI>Dreams</HI> and <HI>Reveries</HI> hovered over him, and at a &s;mall Di&s;tance flowed the River of <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> dull, &s;low, and lazy. Numbers were gathered round the Banks begging a Pa&s;&s;age into this gloomy World, but the <HI>Charon</HI> of the Place, a torpid, decrepid Fellow, known there by the Name of PERCEPTION, gave a few of them a tardy Admittance, and to the greater Part he was entirely deaf. Among tho&s;e, whom he rejected, I perceived a Train, which I took for the nine <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> but was in|formed they never had attempted to pa&s;s that Way, and upon a nearer View I found they were the amiable Band of <HI>moral Virtues,</HI> who were highly de&s;irous of gaining Admittance, which was refu&s;ed them, with the
<PB N="126" REF="129">Addition of as much In&s;olence in the Denial, as if they had been &s;uing at a great Man's Door. They gave me to under&s;tand, that it is now become fa&s;hionable to di&s;card them every where, at which I could not help expre&s;&s;ing great Unea&s;ine&s;s; and I then advanced to|wards the Boatman, PERCEPTION, who, with the Help of his Spectacles, at Length de&s;cried me, and received me into his Care.</P>
<P>The River had a great many Turnings and Windings (for <HI>ductile Dullne&s;s new Maeanders takes</HI>) but, after &s;ome Trouble, we at Length reached the oppo&s;ite Bank. An uncultivated Tract lay before us, dreary, dark and gloomy; no Ray of Light to break through the Mi&s;t; impenetrable Ob&s;curity involved the Scene, and Va|pours rolling over Vapours made every Thing an univer|&s;al Blot. I pur&s;ued my Journey with all po&s;&s;ible Expe|dition, and arrived at the <HI>Repo&s;itory of Ideas,</HI> as it is here called, the Key of which was kept by MEMORY. As I &s;uppo&s;ed this to be a Store-hou&s;e of univer&s;al Know|ledge, I begged to be favoured with a View of the &s;e|veral Acqui&s;itions he had made. I de&s;ired he would produce &s;ome <HI>occult Qualities,</HI> of which I had no Manner of Notion; and I called for &s;everal of the <HI>metaphy&s;ical Train</HI> too tedious to enumerate; in <HI>Divinity</HI> I remem|bered &s;everal Things, of which I never could attain a clear Conception, and I have not Arithmetic enough to recount the Multitude of the <HI>Mathematical</HI> Species which I wanted; the Debates, which I have heard in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> gave me occa&s;ion to enquire for many of the legal Band, and I was curious after an infinite Multitude of the <HI>Parna&s;&s;ian Tribe,</HI> mentioned in a pompous Stile in &s;everal modern Poets. I longed to &s;ee an <HI>en|venomed Shaft, taking its fatal Aim, wind wafting Pray|ers on ro&s;y Wings to Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. I begged a Sight of <HI>Colley Cibber</HI>'s old Friend BATTLE ARRAY, and the many other Poetic Beings, which he and others of his
<PB N="127" REF="130">Brethren of the Quill, had created; but all to no Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Place we came to was the <HI>Lugentes Campi,</HI> or the mournful Fields, &s;acred to <HI>Venus.</HI> I met with nothing here but <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Darts, con&s;uming Fires, and all the modern Train of Love's Artillery. As I was &s;ufficiently acquainted with the&s;e, from a con&s;tant and unwearied Peru&s;al of our modern Tragedies and other poetical Productions, I ha&s;tened to the Seat, where JUDGMENT pre&s;ided.</P>
<P>Judgment &s;eldom made any Deci&s;ions of his own, but was bia&s;&s;ed in all his Decrees by &s;everal that &s;urrounded him, with &s;o much Authority, that I &s;uppo&s;ed they were in the Commi&s;&s;ion. The Chief of the&s;e was PRIDE, with a lofty Air and &s;upercilious Brow, which called to my Mind the excellent Remark in the E&s;&s;ay on Cri|tici&s;m;
<Q><L>Of all the Cau&s;es which con&s;pire to blind</L>
<L>Man's erring Judgment, and mi&s;guide his Mind,</L>
<L>Which the weak Head with &s;ure&s;t Bia&s;s rules,</L>
<L>Is <HI>Pride,</HI> the never-failing Vice of Fools.</L>
<BIBL><HI>POPE.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Next in Place was ILL-NATURE, callous and hardened to every gentle Sen&s;ation of Humanity, and quite a Stranger to that Delicacy of elegant Minds, which be|holds the Merit of another with Plea&s;ure; but on the contrary, every Thing &s;hining with the &s;malle&s;t Degree of Lu&s;tre is the Object of his Aver&s;ion, and he is never plea&s;ed but with the Misfortunes of his Neighbours. PREJUDICE al&s;o &s;eemed to have no &s;mall Influence with the Court, and VENALITY, with itching Palm, fre|quently gave a new Turn to every Thing, being ready to engage on either Side in Politicks, to abu&s;e a worthy Character in Satire, or exalt a ba&s;e one in dedicatory Panegyric.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Principles I could ea&s;ily imagine to my&s;elf what Kind of Opinions were likely to ari&s;e, and there|fore
<PB N="128" REF="131">ha&s;tened towards <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI> In my Way, I perceived a de&s;olate Tract, which may be called the Region of Tortures. Here I &s;aw <HI>Grief, De&s;pair, Envy, Revenge,</HI> and all the agonizing Cares, that made this Place wor&s;e, than what the Poets fable of their <HI>Tartarus.</HI> In one Part was to be &s;een <HI>Ambition</HI> falling back, like the Stone of <HI>Si&s;yphus;</HI> in another Place, <HI>Hunger</HI> was tantalized with the Hopes of a Supper, but the wor&s;t of Fiends, cruel <HI>Want</HI> forbids the Touch. Here &s;tood a Pillory, with <HI>Defamation</HI> nailed to it by the Ears, there a Blanket &s;tretched out, and a Bard going to be to&s;&s;ed in it.&mdash; Here a tumultuous Play-hou&s;e at the Damnation of a Virgin Mu&s;e; the &s;neering Beaux in the Boxes di&s;play their fal&s;e Teeth; the Pit ri&s;es enraged, the Gallery open-its rude Throats, and nothing is to be heard but <Q>throw him over&mdash;won't y' ha' &s;ome Orange Chips &mdash;won't y' ha' &s;ome Nonpareils&mdash;off the Stage, off,</Q> till at Length the Catcal Whizzes, and the poor Poet in the mean Time is ready to expire, and Pangs as bad as Hell t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rment him.</P>
<P>Had I all the Pens of all the Scriblers of the Age, I &s;hould not be able to relate every Occurrence in my Adventures, and I was by this Time admoni&s;hed by my Guide, that we were arrived at the Seat of Happine&s;s. Here we found <HI>Invention</HI> happy in a Review of all his airy Beings, that were fluttering round him in a va|riegated Dre&s;s, pre&s;&s;ing and crowding upon each other, as if to force a Pa&s;&s;age into open Day. I &s;tood for a Time wondering at this mighty Bu&s;tle, and then en|quired what might be the Cau&s;e of it. To which IN|VENTION, <Q>that bright Band which you behold &s;o eagerly gathering about the Gates of Life, are the cho&s;en Few, to whom <HI>Apollo</HI> has appointed a new Birth into the World, and they are now impatiently waiting till proper Bodies are prepared for them by tho&s;e <HI>poetical Midwives,</HI> commonly called <HI>Book&s;ellers.</HI> They were all in the Beginning wa&s;ted over by PERCEPTION,
<PB N="129" REF="132">whom you have &s;een, and were thence conveyed to the Repo&s;itory of Ideas, in the Care of MEMORY, till in the various Cour&s;e of human Contingencies, they are again called forth, and by my Skill, arranged in proper Order for their Appearance among the Sons of Men.</Q></P>
<P>Thus having &s;aid, he led me round the whole Extent of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> gave me a compleat View of all his intellec|tual Train, and at Length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me through the Ivory Gate to breath the vital Air, to which I was highly plea&s;ed to find my&s;elf re&s;tored, and the Joy occa&s;ioned by this Reflection operated &s;o &s;trongly on my Spirits, that I felt my&s;elf in &s;ome Agitation, and was in&s;tantly wakened out of my Dream.</P>

<P><HI>Jack Oak&s;tick</HI> was indicted for that he, on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night the 16th of <HI>February,</HI> went into the Middle Gal|lery
<PB N="132" REF="135">at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-hou&s;e, and from thence one Apple, Value a Farthing, on the Stage did fling to the great Annoyance of the Actors, and Di&s;turbance of the Com|pany. The Fact was proved by two undeniable Evi|dences, who, being interrogated whether they had not the Freedom of the Hou&s;e, &s;everally an&s;wered, that they had not, and added, that they did not even go in with an Order, and that their only Motive for appearing on the Occa&s;ion was, to bring to condign Puni&s;hment an Offender again&s;t the Re&s;pect and good Manners due to a public A&s;&s;embly. Whereupon the Pri&s;oner, being a&s;ked by the Court what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, made An&s;wer that he was drunk, and, as he hoped to be &s;aved, it was nothing but an innocent Frolick. GUILTY; upon which he was ordered to wait upon the Managers of the abovementioned Theatre to a&s;k their Pardon for his Mi&s;behaviour, and he was &s;entenced to drink but a Pint of Wine after his Dinner for the future. &mdash;</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Peter Je&s;&s;amy</HI> was indicted for &s;tanding between the Scenes in &s;uch a Manner as to hurt the mo&s;t pathetic Situations of the Drama. GUILTY; but it appearing to the Court, that it was not done with Malice prepen&s;e, but only with intent to di&s;play his Cloaths to the Ladies, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without any other Puni&s;hment than a &s;evere Reprimand, and an Order, that he &s;hould not be admitted behind the Scenes again without giving Se|curity for his good Behaviour, of which Mr. <HI>Varney</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crudge</HI> are to take proper Notice.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Wife of <HI>John Gayle&s;s,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was in|dicted, for that &s;he, not having the Love of her Hu&s;band before her Eyes, hath, for the Space of three Years pa&s;t, ob&s;tinately, willfully, and urged on by the In&s;tigation of a certain Fury called GAMING, addicted all her At|tention to Cards, to the great pecuniary Detriment of her Hu&s;band, and the utter Extinction of all dome&s;tic Happine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">The Cau&s;e was opened by Coun&s;ellor <HI>Manly,</HI> who urged in a long Harangue, that it is an ab&s;olute Apo&s;tacy from all that can be counted elegant in the fair Sex, to &s;pend a Life over a Pack of Cards; that &s;uch a Conduct can only &s;erve to &s;poil their Complexions, di&s;turb their Tempers, &s;uppre&s;s the natural Affections, which alone can create conjugal Felicity; that it mu&s;t inevitably put to flight the <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> which would otherwi&s;e hover round them, and in their &s;tead, &s;urround them with a Band of <HI>Harpies,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Su&s;picion, Mi&s;tru&s;t, Vex|ation, Di&s;appointment,</HI> &amp;c. and that, in &s;hort, it mu&s;t at la&s;t bring on &s;uch an In&s;en&s;ibility, as to render a Wo|man capable of venturing a Daughter's Portion upon the turning up of a Die, and oblige her to &s;urrender her lovely Per&s;on, in Ca&s;e of Non-payment, upon an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> from the Court of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>After this, <HI>Betty Minnikin,</HI> Chambermaid to the Pri|&s;oner, was examined, and &s;he depo&s;ed, as how her Mi&s;tre&s;s never went to Bed till Four or Five in the Morn|ing, and that &s;he had often heard her &s;ay, &s;he actually thought the King of Clubs a much hand&s;omer Man than her Hu&s;band.</P>

<P><HI>James Ditto, Mercer,</HI> was &s;worn and depo&s;ed, that he had &s;erved the Lady ever &s;ince her Marriage, and that he knew no more of the Colour of her Money, than of the real Colour of her Face, though he was informed by her Hu&s;band, and he verily believed the &s;ame to be true, that &s;he had been &s;upplied occa&s;ionally with Money to di&s;charge all her Bills.</P>

<P>May it plea&s;e this Honourable Court, I am a Beau, and in order to &s;upport that Character, I thought it would not be ami&s;s to have a few Treaties of Marriage de|pending, though, at the &s;ame Time, I prote&s;t, I have no Attachment to any one breathing except my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Upon this the Pri&s;oner re&s;ted his Cau&s;e, and the Jury, without retiring, brought in their <HI>Verdict, a Male Jilt,</HI> and the Court adjudged, upon the Statute of <HI>I&s;aac Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> that no Lady whatever &s;hould admit the Addre&s;&s;es of <HI>John Vainlove,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> unle&s;s he could produce a Cha|racter from the Lady he la&s;t &s;erved, te&s;tifying that, <HI>he behaved well in her Service.</HI></P>

<P>_TO endeavour at &s;ome Degree of Self-Know|ledge, was the con&s;tant Advice of the ethic Writers among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> and this Precept we find inculcated by each of them in Terms that come home to every Man's Brea&s;t. Among the Moderns, my Lord <HI>Sha&s;t&s;bury,</HI> has more particularly enforced the Doctrine to the Race of Writers, and has recommended this intuitive Intercour&s;e to every Author, by de&s;iring him frequently to enter into a <HI>Soliloquy</HI> with him&s;elf; by which Means he will probably &s;tand informed, whether he can boa&s;t that in|tellectual Harmony, which is requi&s;ite for the Formation of a ta&s;teful Mind; whether he is &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Progre&s;s of the human Under&s;tanding, the &s;e|cret Movements of the Heart, the Grace of Character, the Beauty of Virtue, and all tho&s;e elegant Refinements of Thinking, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to reach any Degree of Excellence in a Compo&s;ition. We likewi&s;e find that <HI>Boileau,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Satyri&s;t, was aware of the Nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;piritual Retreat (if I may be allowed to call it &s;o) and accordingly he has entered into a Review of him&s;elf in his ninth Satire, which is certainly as plea&s;ant a Piece of Humour and Raillery, as ever was produced by any Writer antient or modern. The Poet addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to his own Mind, by &s;aying,
<PB N="143" REF="146">that he wants to hold a little private Conver&s;ation with that internal Agent, whom he had too long encouraged in Whims and Frolicks, by an indolent Indulgence; and, now that his Patience is provoked to the utmo&s;t, he will, once for all, tell him his own.

The Dialogue was carried on with great Warmth on both Sides, as if there was really an inte&s;tine War within me. As I am willing to di&s;clo&s;e my&s;elf, as well as to di&s;&s;ect any other Character, that occurs to me in my Rambles, for the more effectual Improvement or Entertainment of my Readers, I &s;hall lay the whole <HI>Drama,</HI> before them this Day. The candid, I am con|vinced, will pardon all &s;uch Errors, as ari&s;e from the Imbecillity of human Nature, and the Enemies of the Author (if he has any) will abate from their Inveteracy, when they perceive that timorous Self love cannot pre|vail upon him to conceal his own Infirmities.</P>

<P>_THE Stoic Philo&s;ophy was by many of the Antients e&s;teemed the Height of human Wi&s;dom, the &s;ure Road to Happine&s;s, and the la&s;t Fini&s;hing and Apotheo&s;is of an ex|alted Character. Its Excellence con&s;i&s;ted, not in the due Government of the Pa&s;&s;ions, but in extirpating them totally from the human Heart; by which means the Seat of feeling, and Source of every exqui&s;ite Plea|&s;ure, as well as tender Pain, was rendered quite cal|lous and in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;uffered to move only with the Flux and Reflux of the Blood, without being agitated with any Kind of Sen&s;ation whatever. Our excellent Poet has given us a very picture&s;que De&s;cription of this notable Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<Q><L><HI>In lazy Apathy let Stoics boa&s;t</HI></L>

<L><HI>Contracted all retiring to the Brea&s;t;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Strength of Mind is Exerci&s;e, not Re&s;t.</HI></L></Q>
<P>How an ab&s;olute Repugnance to the Laws of Nature, and the Want of tho&s;e Feelings, which are the be&s;t In|gredients in our Compo&s;ition, can in any Way con&s;ti|tute an exalted Character I am at a lo&s;s to determine. <HI>Vita &s;ecundum Naturam,</HI> a Life conformable to the Laws of Nature, is <HI>Tully</HI>'s Definition of a moral, as well as an happy State. Certain it is, all Elegance of Mind,
<PB N="150" REF="153">and Reli&s;h for Virtue, mu&s;t ari&s;e from tho&s;e Sen|sations, which Nature has implanted in us, as Ex|citements to Action, and Inlets for due Degrees of Plea|&s;ure and Pain. Without the&s;e, our mo&s;t refined Gra|tifications mu&s;t &s;uffer a con&s;iderable Abatement; the plea&s;ing Anxieties of virtuous Friend&s;hip, the grateful Solicitude of Love, the melancholy Luxury of tender Compa&s;&s;ion, and the Delights which we derive from a well-wrought Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s in an affecting Tragedy, mu&s;t all lo&s;e their Influence, and the Mind &s;ink into a dull State of In&s;en&s;ibility. For my Part, I have always had a &s;overeign Contempt for the unfeeling, pedantic Wi&s;dom of tho&s;e unnatural Followers of a brutal Phi|lo&s;ophy; nor could I ever admire their ridiculous O&s;ten|tation of a towering Superiority of Soul. That this is al&s;o the Sen&s;e of the greater Part of Mankind, is very vi&s;ible from that &s;oporific Awe, with which they behold Per&s;onages of this Ca&s;t, when interwoven into the Drama; while Characters of a mixed Nature, in whom the Pa&s;|&s;ions are in a beautiful Struggle between Virtue and Vice, are always &s;ure to &s;eize the Affections of an Au|dience, and intere&s;t every Heart in the Fortunes of the Hero thus repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has tran&s;mitted to us a Picture of the Comple|tion of that Happine&s;s, which was the exalted Boa&s;t of the Stoics: In the Words of my Motto, he tells us, that the Per&s;on, whom he de&s;cribes in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of true Felicity, is never touched with popular E&s;teem, or the dazling Splendor of the regal State; that Difference between Brothers, Con&s;piracies again&s;t his Country, or the Decline of the Con&s;titution, never di&s;turb his Brea&s;t; nor is he ever made unea&s;y by Compa&s;&s;ion for the Indi|gent, or Envy towards the great. This is a Cha|racter totally different from the amiable Sketch, by his Brother Poet, of the Man who con&s;iders the Relations in which he &s;tands to Society, and feels for all Mankind. The negative Enjoyments above de&s;cribed can re&s;ult
<PB N="151" REF="154">from nothing but an ab&s;olute Indifference to our Fellow-Creatures, and is &s;o far from being commendable, that, in my Opinion, it is equalled by every Debauchee in Town. I was lately in Company with one of this Cla&s;s, who appeared to me to be a very great Proficient in the Stoic Philo&s;ophy, and to have carried into his Practice, every Branch of the foregoing Sy&s;tem, and as a further In&s;tance of the Excellence of the Stoic School, I &s;hall here pre&s;ent my Readers with a Character of a modern Stoic Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Wildair</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Fortune, which might enable him to live with Splendor, or to pro&s;ecute any Enterprize in the Service of his Country; he has al&s;o the Advantages of Birth, to render him reputable in the Eye of the World; but like a true Philo&s;opher he never placed any Value upon the&s;e happy Circum&s;tances. With a noble Contempt for Riches, he &s;quanders away his Sub&s;tance in a Manner which &s;hews him to be above the mean Ambition of popular Applau&s;e; and, in&s;tend of being arrogantly elated with the Thoughts of his high Birth, he has been known to a&s;&s;ociate with the lowe&s;t of Mankind, &s;o &s;uperior is he to tho&s;e little Sen|&s;ations of Pride which might be apt to play about the Heart of a Man of worldly Vanity. Contented in his own Mind, he never conde&s;cended to court the Favour of his Countrymen at an Election for Member of Parlia|ment. The <HI>populi Fa&s;ces</HI> have never had any Attrac|tion for <HI>Jack Wildair,</HI> and &s;o little is he touched with the Splendor of Maje&s;ty, that he does not care for any King in <HI>Europe.</HI> While all our Politicians have made the two <HI>Brothers</HI> the con&s;tant Object of their Attention, he is little &s;ollicitous whether there be a Difference be|tween them or not. The Fortifications of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the Depredations of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> upon our Merchantmen, the Election of the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Equipment of <HI>French</HI> Fleets, and all the other Points of Moment, which engro&s;s the Thoughts
<PB N="152" REF="155">of our pre&s;ent Race of Patriots, never once di&s;compo&s;ed the Serenity of his Mind. Liberty and Property are to him unideal Sounds, and if <HI>Magna Charta</HI> were burned by the common Hangman, it would not occa&s;ion the lea&s;t Gloom in our Hero's Soul. He can al&s;o behold the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Indigent, the corroding Anxieties of Poverty, mo&s;t Stoic like, without a &s;ingle Sigh. <HI>Nec doluit mi&s;erans inopem;</HI> and &s;o far from being envious of another's Superiority in Life, while he is ea&s;y him&s;elf, he never was yet known to compare his own Situation with any Man above him, though he has now and then conde&s;cended to ca&s;t a Look beneath him, with no &s;mall Degree of Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor does the Firmne&s;s of <HI>Wildair</HI>'s Mind re&s;t here. He can vi&s;it all the Brothels in this Metropolis, with|out feeling the lea&s;t Degree of Unea&s;ine&s;s. He can be|hold, undi&s;turbed by any of tho&s;e tender Touches, which might agitate weaker Brea&s;ts, an elegant Form, and the mo&s;t beautiful Set of Features falling a Prey to <HI>In&s;amy, Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;titution;</HI> and as the antient Wor|thies thought it a noble Atchievement totally to forget the Man, in order to rai&s;e their philo&s;ophic Fame to an higher Degree of Eminence, &s;o our modern Stoic can fat pre&s;s the natural Affections, and in the Rake he can al&s;o forget the Man. <HI>Jack Wildair</HI> is a very <HI>Roman</HI> in that Point; he is an excellent Practitioner of <HI>Horace</HI>'s golden Rule, to admire nothing; and, if confined to the Ped of Sickne&s;s, to repair the Wa&s;te made by Folly and Intemperance, he is &s;ure to &s;pend his Time in a Series of moral Reflections. He wi&s;ely ob&s;erves, that all Plea|&s;ure is fugitive; that the Rever&s;ion of Pain falls to every Man's Lot; and that the Condition of human Life is frail and uncertain. When his Health returns, he in|dulges in all the Sallies of his wild Imagination, to &s;hew, that, like <HI>Ari&s;tippus,</HI> he can adapt him&s;elf to every Situation. In &s;hort, <HI>Jack Wildair</HI> has upon all Occa|&s;ions a true Philo&s;ophical Turn; and indeed in all Oc|currences
<PB N="153" REF="156">of Life every Thing is &s;ure to &s;ugge&s;t to him tho&s;e Reflections, which are mo&s;t conducive to &s;ecure his own Happine&s;s, to prevent the ruffled State ari&s;ing from conflicting Pa&s;&s;ions, to pre&s;erve the even Tenor of his Thoughts, to reconcile him to him&s;elf, and enable him to po&s;&s;e&s;s his Soul in Ea&s;e, Tranquility, and Chearful|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This Character of a modern Town Philo&s;opher con|tains, in my Opinion, all the Branches of the much boa&s;ted &s;toic Sy&s;tem, and all the leading Principles of Happine&s;s, which it inculcates, are carried by our mo|dern Academic to a much greater Height of Wi&s;dom and Felicity, than they ever were by the mo&s;t rigid Follower of the &s;toic Academy, in &s;o much as the modern Hero grafts his Happine&s;s on the Pa&s;&s;ions, which he plays again&s;t one another, and in that Sen&s;e may be &s;aid to live <HI>&s;ecundum naturam;</HI> whereas the antient Stoic endeavoured to &s;ubvert the very Elements of our being, and among that Sect, he was the mo&s;t exalted Worthy, who was the mo&s;t dive&s;ted of Humanity.</P>

<P>_THE pantomime Poet, from whom I &s;ome Time ago felt a little Interruption in my Studies, has remained in the Chambers o|ver my. Head ever &s;ince; but, the Fervour of his Enthu&s;ia&s;m being a good deal abated, he has proved a very peaceable and quiet Neighbour. For though he cannot entirely refrain from his peripatetic Lucubrations, he is, however, careful to conduct them with a Degree of Temperance, and he now proves a Companion of very &s;ingular and entertaining Oddities. The other Morning he paid me a Vi&s;it, and was con|tented in the Beginning to conver&s;e with me upon com|mon and ordinary Topics, upon which he di&s;cour&s;ed with &s;ufficient Sedatene&s;s. At length he took occa&s;ion to introduce the Subject which was the Cau&s;e of his Vi&s;it, and I ob&s;erved, that the Moment he touched up|on his favourite Scheme of Thinking, he betrayed &s;e|veral whim&s;ical Ge&s;tures, and an extraordinary Manner of Addre&s;s. <Q>Sir, &s;ays he, I have taken the Liberty to intrude upon you this Morning, in order to con&s;ult you in Relation to a Work, which I have had in Hand for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, and which I think cannot fail to be of public Utility, as it is one of the De|&s;iderata in Literature, and a Species of Critici&s;m likely to be productive of &s;ingular Advantages to the learned World. The Thing I mean, Sir, is THE ART OF PANTOMIME, which I propo&s;e to publi&s;h by Sub|&s;cription, not noubting but I &s;hall meet with &s;uitable
<PB N="156" REF="159">Encouragement to pro&s;ecute &s;o arduous a Ta&s;k, and if Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> will be kind enough to favour me with his Recommendation, I &s;hall for the future e|&s;teem him, as a generous Promoter of the polite Arts.</Q></P>
<P>In order to be able to comply with my Friend's Reque&s;t, and to &s;erve him as effectually as my &s;mall Abilities will permit me, I de&s;ired him to explain to me at large the Plan of his Undertaking, and the whole Method, which he had chalked out to him&s;elf for &s;o noble a Work. Upon which I was informed, that he intends to execute his De&s;ign, in Imitation of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> divided into as many Sections, and, as near as the Nature of the Subject will admit, comprized under the &s;ame Heads. His fir&s;t Chapter is to &s;et out with an Account of the imitative Arts, in which Pan|tomime will be proved to be &s;uperior to all the Re&s;t, having the greate&s;t Variety of Ge&s;ticulation, and the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Significance in all its Attitudes and Actions. In the next Section, it will appear what Sort of Per&s;ons and Things are proper for Imitation, and that the Pantomime Poet mu&s;t either attach him&s;elf to the Repre&s;entation of Per&s;onages above the ordinary Race of human Nature, &s;uch as Magicians, Enchanters, Genii, Gods, Imps, and Mon&s;ters, Devils, Furies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to the Exhibition of Characters to be met with in the ordi|nary Occurrences of Life, &s;uch as we find introduced in <HI>Harlequin Ranger.</HI> Then follows a Di&s;&s;ertation upon the proper Manner of imitating, and Enquiry into the Origin of Pantomime, tracing it from the Time of <HI>Herace</HI> down to the glorious Time of Mahomet <HI>Carathra.</HI></P>
<P>After this, our Author proceeds to examine into the Nature of <HI>Farces,</HI> and &s;hows how they differ from the <HI>Pantomime.</HI> He then enters more minutely into the Laws of <HI>Pantomime,</HI> and gives an Account of it's &s;eve|ral Parts. Among the&s;e the Fable is fir&s;t con&s;idered, and it is allowed, it may be either &s;imple or implex. He does
<PB N="157" REF="160">not totally reject the former, but in&s;i&s;ts principally upon the Beauties of the complicated Plot, &s;uch as <HI>Harlequin Sorcerer,</HI> or the Loves of <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;erpine; Harlequin Fortunatus</HI> being of the &s;imple Kind, con&s;i&s;ting of one Action only, impeded or accelerated by &s;everal Inci|dents, all tending in a direct Line to the Completion of the Whole.</P>
<P>The refined Beauties of the Art offer them&s;elves next, and our Author exhau&s;ts all his Erudition, all his Rhe|toric, and all his whole Stock of Critici&s;m, to point out the Advantages ari&s;ing to a Piece from a well conducted <HI>Peripetia,</HI> which he defines in the&s;e Words. <Q>The pan|tomimical <HI>Peripetia</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in &s;udden Changes of For|tune, ari&s;ing from a Concatenation of Incidents high|ly improbable in their Nature.</Q> Then the <HI>Agnitio</HI> is di&s;played at large, and proved to be the livelie&s;t Beauty in this Species of the Drama, it being a &s;udden Recol|lection in the Per&s;onages of the Piece, when, after a long Ab&s;ence, they recognize, and know each other again. As when <HI>Harlequin</HI> finds Acce&s;s to his <HI>Co|lombine</HI> in a di&s;gui&s;ed Appearance, &s;he by &s;ome Token di&s;covers her Lover, and is happy in his Embrace.</P>
<P>After having enforced the&s;e &s;triking Particulars, he de|livers Rules for the Excitement of Terror, Pity, and the Marvellous. The two former he mentions but &s;lightly, not thinking them e&s;&s;ential in the&s;e Compo&s;itions, but in the Marvellous, he ob&s;erves, con&s;i&s;ts the utmo&s;t Effort of human Genius, and then enumerates the various Means by which it is excited, &s;uch as flying Mercurys, Rope-Dancers, Kicking Straws, Children playing on the Flute, Storms of Rain, Thunder and Lightening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Divi&s;ion of the Work, relates to the Man|ners of each Per&s;onage of the Drama, in which he re|commends a &s;erious Attention to Character, in order the more forcibly to unfold Men and Manners, and the Cu&s;toms, the Intrigues, the Flights and De&s;cents of the
<PB N="158" REF="161">Gods, with the whole Hi&s;tory of the Heathen Mytho|logy. In this Part of the Work he expatiates at large upon the U&s;e of Machinery, and I make no Doubt, will greatly excel the celebrated <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> in this Part of the Performance. Having the Intere&s;ts of the Theatre greatly at Heart, our Author proves, that no Play-hou&s;e can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a good Set of Carpenters, an expeditious Band of Scene-Drawers, excellent Candle-Snuffers, Fire-Eaters, Trap-Door-Men, O&s;triches, Monkeys, Serpents, and the whole animal World, be|&s;ides a Race of Beings never &s;een upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>The Sentiment comes into Con&s;ideration in the fol|lowing Chapter. The &s;everal Modes of the Mind are explained in an ample Manner, and Directions given to the Performer to render him&s;elf perfectly acquainted with the Operation of all the Pa&s;&s;ions on the whole Frame of the Body, and it is laid down as a Rule that he mu&s;t be careful to mark the different Actions of Begging Commanding, Threatning, Interrogating, An&s;wering, that he may be able to impre&s;s a lively Idea of each up|on the Minds of his Spectators.</P>
<P>The Sentiment being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Diction claims our next Regard. Under this Head the &s;everal pretty Pieces of Poetry introduced into <HI>Pantomimes</HI> are criti|ci&s;ed, and proper Rules pre&s;cribed for Writing the&s;e Kind of Non&s;en&s;e&mdash;Ver&s;es. To the whole Work is an|nexed a particular Examen of <HI>Harlequin Fortunatus,</HI> in order to give a Specimen of the great Utility and Truth of the foregoing Rules. I &s;hall therefore conclude this Paper with an Ab&s;tract from this Part of the Work.</P>
<P>There cannot, &s;ays my Author, be &s;ound in any Pan|tomime Writer a better imagined Opening for the Drama, than the fir&s;t Incident in this Piece. The Scene di&s;covers a large Wood, in which the poor, forlorn Har|lequin is wandering, in a violent Storm of Rain, Thun|der and Lightening. In a Fit of De&s;peration he throws
<PB N="159" REF="162">him&s;elf on the Ground, and to heighten our Compa&s;|&s;ion poor Madam <HI>Fortune</HI> is introduced bemoaning her Condition in a very pathetic Strain of Poetry. The ami|able Character of <HI>Fortunatus</HI> is &s;een in his Readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the Sequel conveys a fine Moral, <HI>viz.</HI> that Riches, Riot, and Debauchery are the mo&s;t de&s;irable Things in this World, as the Piece ends with Harlequin's being in the full Enjoyment of all his Wi&s;hes. The Farmer's Yard affords a plea&s;ing Image of rural Happine&s;s, and the beautiful Incident of the Dog's biting the Clown conveys this Incident, that a Dog's obeyed in Office, and it &s;erves further to enforce the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Act of Parliament to le&s;&s;en the Number of Dogs, which over-run the Kingdom, to the great Annoyance of his Maje&s;ty's loyal Subjects. The fre|quent Remembrances between <HI>Columbine</HI> and her <HI>Har|lequin</HI> make upon all Occa&s;ions an admirable <HI>Agnitio,</HI> and the &s;udden Changes of their Fortunes form a very beautiful <HI>Peripetia.</HI> Harlequin's E&s;cape into the Oven, his running up the Chimney, and his Leap over the Gateway, when his Enemies are in clo&s;e Pur&s;uit of him, are all Touches of the highe&s;t Elevation and Genius, and upon the whole, we may &s;ay with Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> that this Piece is admirable for its fine Moralities, its Uni|ver&s;ality, and its Integrity.</P>

<P>_I Had the Honour, in one of my former Pa|pers, of introducing my Readers into that celebrated Academy of Arts and Sciences, THE ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY, which con|tinues in as flouri&s;hing a Condition as ever. La&s;t <HI>Mon|day</HI> I was &s;o happy as to attend the Debates of this learned Body, and with Plea&s;ure I reflected, that the Seat of Inve&s;tigation, Knowledge, and Sen&s;e is now likely to be fixed in BUTCHER-ROW. In Imitation of <HI>Spratt</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Royal Society, I have &s;ome Thoughts of collecting together the Annals of this re|&s;pectable A&s;&s;embly, the Members of which have nothing &s;o much at Heart, as the Di&s;covery of Truth, in&s;o|much that it is common to hear a bare-footed Shoemaker &s;ettle a Point in Philo&s;ophy; a Taylor in Rags prove, that a <HI>Remnant of all &s;hall be &s;aved;</HI> an Attorney bring his Writ of Error again&s;t Revelation; a <HI>Philomath</HI> from <HI>Aberdeen</HI> confute the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion and an in|&s;olvent Trade&s;man, chiefly &s;ollicitous about the na|tional Debt. In &s;hort, &s;uch a Spirit of Free Enquiry reigns in this Seminary, that you may &s;ee Journeymen-Barbers, Hackney-Clerks, Porters, Chairmen, Hack|ney-Coachmen, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all actuated with a no|ble Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and by Turns pleading for Rewards and Puni&s;hments, the Exi&s;tence or Non-Exi&s;tence of a Deity, the moral Fitne&s;s of Things, the eternal Rule of Right, and in half an Hour they are <HI>Shaft&s;burians, Hutchen&s;onians, Mandevillians, Muggletonians, Thei&s;ts, A|thei&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. During the Cour&s;e of their Re&s;earches the
<PB N="162" REF="165">Students are frequently ob&s;erved to make &s;uch vigorous Application to certain Pewter Pots lying before them, and to draw from thence &s;uch copious Draughts, that it is by many imagined the Academy has found out, that the Ancients were mi&s;taken, when they &s;uppo&s;ed TRUTH to be in the Bottom of a Well; this coy and retired Godde&s;s, in the Opinion of the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> So|ciety, being to be found at pre&s;ent in the Bottom of a <HI>Pot of Porter.</HI> Be that as it may, certain it is, the noble Sy&s;tem of Free-thinking is here di&s;played in it's genuine Lu&s;tre, as, I fancy, will appear from the following De|bate, with which I &s;hall fill up the Remainder of this Day's Paper.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Manly.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am again&s;t Operas, for this ca|pital Rea&s;on; <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e mo&s;t of them are compo&s;ed by People ignorant of the fir&s;t Principle of Compo&s;i|tion, which is <HI>Counterpoint,</HI> or the Art of placing dif|ferent Notes, &s;ounding together in true harmonic Or|der. Mu&s;ick, Sir, con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Melody</HI> and <HI>Harmony. Me|lody</HI> is the regular Progre&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle Part; and <HI>Har|mony,</HI> of different Parts united. Now the <HI>Melody</HI> of all the Songs in our late <HI>Italian</HI> Operas is extravagant and unnatural, con&s;equently unplea&s;ing, and &s;itter for In&s;truments than Voices. Their Singers are con&s;tantly endeavouring to &s;urprize, by which Means, their Songs are all Quirks and Divi&s;ions, and the Performers are
<PB N="167" REF="170">&s;ometimes &s;queaking like Cats at the Top of a Hou&s;e, and &s;ometimes growling like Dogs in a Cellar. The Energy of the Words is totally neglected, and the Pa&s;|&s;ion is entirely lo&s;t; and therefore I cannot help won|dering, that, while we have <HI>Handel, Arne, Boyce,</HI> and <HI>Smith,</HI> &amp;c. the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will lavi&s;h Sums upon a fal&s;e and depraved Ta&s;te, merely to be thought Judges of what they do not under&s;tand. I &s;hall fini&s;h, Sir, with a&s;&s;erting, that an elegant <HI>Drama,</HI> by a good Au|thor, and the Mu&s;ic compo&s;ed by either of the Ma&s;ters mentioned already, might be a high and rational En|tertainment; it would certainly &s;ave an immen&s;e Sum to the Nation, and would excite &s;ome new Genius's to &s;tudy, and excel all other Nations, in manly, &s;en&s;ible Compo&s;itions, where the Sound would be an Echo to the Sen&s;e, and the Pa&s;&s;ions would be agitated by the joint Power of Poetry and Harmony.</P>

<Q>Mendici, Mimi, Balatrones, hoc Genus omne.
<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THERE is not a Word, in the whole Com|pa&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, more gro&s;ly abu&s;ed than the Term <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> which, at pre&s;ent, means no more than that Men eat together, walk together, game together, und are grave and merry, drunk and &s;ober together, without ever conceiving any real Regard for each others Hap|pine&s;s and Intere&s;t. I believe every Day's Experience will point out many, who are Dupes to this florid Out|&s;ide
<PB N="168" REF="171">of Friend&s;hip. In the Cour&s;e of my Ob&s;ervation I have marked out a particular Character that falls more egregiou&s;ly into this Error, than the re&s;t of Mankind. The Character I mean is that of THE COMICAL FEL|LOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, or THE CURSED HIGH FELLOW, or THE MAN OF INFINITE HU|MOUR, or THE GENIUS, or by whatever Name (for many Names will &s;uit him) you may plea&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h the Per&s;on, whom a cheerful Flow of Spirits, and a quick Circulation of the Ideas, that fall to his Share, con&s;pire to render an entertaining Com|panion.</P>
<P>The COMICAL FELLOW, is in high Reque&s;t among all his Acquaintance; and different Parties at the <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> the <HI>Bedford-Arms,</HI> the <HI>King's-Arms,</HI> &amp;c. are vying with each other to have him the Ma&s;ter of the Joke in their convivial Parties, becau&s;e he is without Doubt the fine&s;t Creature in the World to kill an Hour with, the merry Droll has &s;uch Variety of Chat, and &s;uch a deal of Humour in telling a Story. But while this Son of Gaiety and Wit is thus happy in the Care&s;&s;es of all the Lovers of Mirth, this &s;ecret Misfortune attends him, that he has not any where procured him&s;elf the lea&s;t Degree of E&s;teem, becau&s;e it is too well known, that he has not a &s;ingle Virtue under the Sun, that he would at any Time, according to the common Saying, rather lo&s;e his Friend than his Joke, that no Obligation can bind him, but that indi&s;criminately he la&s;hes all alike, and is con&s;tantly upon the look out for &s;ome Incident, which by a Perver&s;ion of Circum&s;tances, or by a few Touches of Mimickry, or &s;ome other adventitious Aid, may be worked up into a Story for the Entertainment of the next Company he goes into. On this Account THE AGREEABLE DEVIL is held in utter Contempt; but the Vivacity of his Imagination will not afford him Lei&s;ure to attend to this; his Vanity is fully gratified by the general Applau&s;e he meets with, and he is con|&s;tantly
<PB N="169" REF="172">exhau&s;ting his &s;canty Finances in keeping Com|pany with a Set of People, who are good humoured enough to be perpetually entertained with his Jokes.&mdash;</P>
<P>I will venture to affirm, that few Evils are more epi|demic, than this Rage of being an HIGH-FELLOW, and I am apt to think, that many of tho&s;e Bankrupt|cies, which fill the Columns of the <HI>Gazette,</HI> are not en|tirely owing to Lo&s;&s;es in Trade, but to the pitiful Am|bition of di&s;covering a fine Vein of Humour. When once the &s;ober Cit becomes the Ringleader in Wit and frolick Fe&s;tivity, when once he has learned to <HI>elevate and &s;urprize,</HI> his Shop a&s;&s;umes a gloomy A&s;pect; Book|keeping is but a dull Employment, unfit for Men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ner Senfations, and in&s;tantly his fervid Imagination conveys him to the <HI>Gentleman and Porter;</HI> then he cracks each Joke over again, and thrice he enjoys the Laugh, and thrice repeats the Pun. But in a little Time, his Name is in&s;erted in the <HI>Gazette</HI> with a WHEREAS; his former Companions &s;hake their Heads, and are very &s;orry for it; <Q>he was a Wag, a merry Man; a CO|MICAL FELLOW,&mdash;but Bu&s;ine&s;s is a &s;erious Thing.</Q></P>
<P>Poor <HI>Jack Spatter!</HI>&mdash;He is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t re|markable of all THE AGREEABLE DEVILS I have ever known. <HI>Jack</HI> does not want a Share of native Hu|mour, and he dre&s;&s;es up a Story at &s;econd hand with &s;uch additional Touches, that a Man is frequently as much entertained as if he had never heard it before, or if he him&s;elf had not told it to him the very Day be|&s;ore. For it is often the d'verting Rogues Way unwit|tingly to fa&s;ten with <HI>&s;omething cur&s;ea High</HI> upon the very Per&s;on, who at fir&s;t &s;upplied him with the Subject. And then THE GENIUS is &s;uch a Mimick!&mdash;Well to be &s;ure nothing can e&s;cape him. A Cat, a Dog, a Monkey, a Manager, a <HI>Burletta-Girl,</HI> a <HI>Woodward,</HI> a <HI>Garrick,</HI> all mu&s;t undergo the Touches of his humour&oacute;us Imitation, and mean while, the Company, Whores, Waiters and all, do &s;o laugh, and &s;o &s;hake their Side,
<PB N="170" REF="173">that Life is quite flat and in&s;ipid without <HI>Jack Spatter.</HI> But in this World, where, as <HI>Moliere</HI> &s;ays, <HI>on donne rien pour rien,</HI> where every Thing mu&s;t be paid for, it can|not but prove very expen&s;ive to be thus a&s;piring in Company. But <HI>Jack</HI>'s Vanity extends to Expence, as well as Wit and Humour. How many Shifts have I known him to make, that he might di&s;play his Vivacity at the Tavern!&mdash;A Turtle-Fea&s;t was &s;ometime &s;ince fixed at the <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>Arms</HI> in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and <HI>Spatter</HI> was in|vited to make one. "A Turtle Fea&s;t," &s;ays <HI>Jack,</HI> <Q>very well!&mdash;it can't be better&mdash;Citizens laugh hear|tily when their Bellies are full&mdash;I'll certainly go&mdash; but how to pay my Reckoning!&mdash;There's <HI>Title|page,</HI> the Book&s;eller;&mdash;he likes a Touch of my Humour&mdash;he'll tip me two Guineas for an Epi|logue&mdash;I'll write him one&mdash;let me &s;ee what's here?&mdash;<HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Mi&s;cellany!</HI>&mdash;I'll tran&s;cribe one from this.</Q>&mdash;No &s;ooner &s;aid than done, for <HI>Jack</HI> has quick Parts, and away he &s;ets out towards <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> meets his Friend <HI>Humdrum</HI> at <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> reads the Piece to him, to &s;hew what a COMICAL DEVIL he is; <HI>Humdrum</HI> admires it; <HI>Jack</HI> forgets that he &s;tole it, and admires it more, touches Two Guineas from <HI>Title-page,</HI> and who but he at the Turtle-Fea&s;t? A <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> re|quires &s;omewhat a larger Capital. "Egad," &s;ay <HI>Jack,</HI> <Q>I'll write a Pamphlet for that, and touch Five Gui|neas</Q>&mdash;To work he falls, and fini&s;hes his Piece in the Space of one Morning, though it co&s;t the Original Au|thors from whom he compiled it, many nocturnal Vi|gils. A Jant to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the Summer Sea&s;on, with &s;ome Lovers of Wit and Humour could not but be agreeable to Mr. <HI>Spatter;</HI> and &s;o in&s;tantly he &s;ets down and writes a Farce; and becau&s;e <HI>Fielding</HI>'s <HI>Coffec|hou&s;e Politician</HI> is not very likely to be acted again on either of our Stages, what does the merry Wag do, but he takes the Character, gives it a new Name, makes a little Alteration in the Scene, where the
<PB N="171" REF="174"><HI>Politician</HI> reads the News-Papers, and in&s;tantly <HI>Genial Jacob, and a warm third Day,</HI> as the Poet has it, equips the GENIUS for <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> Thus is the CURSED HIGH FELLOW, the AMIABLE FRIPON, perpetually &s;pending the Income of his Brain, and torturing his Invention in Endeavours to live with tho&s;e, who have Fortunes to &s;upply their Expences, and who do not entertain the lea&s;t Symptom of Friend&s;hip towards their merry Com|panion. What will become of him, when he has played all his Tricks, I tremble to think, and, as if his Mis|fortunes were now pre&s;ent, I cannot help crying out, <Q>Alas, poor <HI>Yorick!</HI>&mdash;I knew him, a Fellow of infinite Je&s;t&mdash;where be your Gibes now? Your Fla&s;hes of Merriment, that were wont to &s;et the Table on a roar?&mdash;Quite Chop-fallen!</Q></P>
<P>But my Fancy has pictured this Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s &s;o &s;trongly to me, that I could wi&s;h &s;ome Means could be devi&s;ed to avert the impending Evil. An Ingenious Gentleman, whom I have the Plea&s;ure of knowing, propo&s;ed &s;ome Time &s;ince a Scheme for an HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED POLTS. Suppo&s;e, in Imitation of this laudable De&s;ign, an Ho&s;pital were to be rai&s;ed for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS. For my Part, I cannot but think the Plan &s;hould meet with general Encourage|ment, and I will willingly give the Profits of this Paper, N^o. 79, towards carrying it into Execution. Mr. <HI>Gar|rick</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> will, I dare &s;ay, contribute on their Parts an annual Benefit towards this Charity, the Ob|jects of which may be admitted, as follows.</P>
<P><Q>It being certified to us, that the Bearer&mdash;<HI>A.B.;</HI> was an AGREEABLE DEVIL, and entirely ruined him|&s;elf by endeavouring to keep Company with Men of Fortune, who countenanced him merely as their Je&s;ter, you are hereby directed to admit the &s;aid unhappy plea&s;ant Creature into the Ho&s;pital for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS, <HI>London</HI>&mdash;<HI>Signed by Two Directors.</HI></Q>
<PB N="172" REF="175">
Should this Propo&s;al take Effect, I &s;hall rejoice at being in&s;trumental in the Redemption of &s;o many diverting Creatures from utter Mi&s;ery; for &s;urely it would be melancholy to reflect that he, who often enlivened even the &s;prightly <HI>Champain,</HI> might become mi&s;erably witty in an Ale-hou&s;e, or be a joking <HI>Boot-catcher</HI> at an Inn, and tell your Honour a Story, while he is dive&s;ting your Legs of their leathern Incumbrance. I &s;hall there|fore hope that all true Lovers of Humour will promote the Scheme, ju&s;t hinted, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, who ruin them&s;elves for their Plea&s;ure; and I &s;hall be highly plea&s;ed that there will be a Receptacle for poor <HI>Jack Spatter,</HI> and that the AGREEABLE DEVIL may, in his old Days, find Repo&s;e in the HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS.</P>

<P>THIS Day came on a remarkable Trial in this Court, in which the <HI>Muffin-Man,</HI> the <HI>Watchmen,</HI> &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. were <HI>Plaintiffs,</HI> and&mdash;<HI>Shuter,</HI> Comedian at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Covent-Garden, Defendant,</HI> up|on an Action brought again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Shuter</HI> for Da|mages &s;uffered by the <HI>Plantiffs</HI> at a public Exhibition on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Evening la&s;t, when they were all taken off, as it is called, with &s;uch lively Touches of Mimickery, that the Audience was kept in a con&s;tant Bur&s;t of Laughter, to the very great Unea&s;ine&s;s of the &s;aid <HI>Plain|tiffs.</HI> The Jury being impanelled, Coun&s;eller <HI>Blunder|bu&s;s</HI> opened the Cau&s;e in a very vehement Speech.

<P>The <HI>Muffin-Man,</HI> he in&s;i&s;ted, was &s;o reputable and worthy a Per&s;onage, that nothing but the Height of In|&s;olence could induce a Mimic on the Stage to attempt to hurt him in his Reputation. If the&s;e Things are per|mitted, he could not determine where the Thing would end, and he him&s;elf, he added, might be treated in the &s;ame Sort; he therefore prayed, that the Gentlemen of the Jury would take the Premi&s;es into Con&s;ideration, and award &s;uitable Damages.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Application of Part of our Time to Letters is recommended by the Author of my Motto in &s;uch glowing Colourings, as &s;erve at once elegantly to di&s;play the mani|&s;old Advantages re&s;ulting from Study, and at the &s;ame Time prove an Incentive to every Mind to enlarge its Views, and encrea&s;e its Store of Ideas, by a due At|tention to the Labours of the Learned. "Letters," &s;ays the <HI>Roman</HI> Orator, <Q>cheri&s;h and invigorate the Mind in its greener Years, amu&s;e it in the more advanced Periods of Life, beam a Lu&s;tre on Pro&s;perity, and &s;often the Shocks of Adver&s;ity; they yield Delight in our dome&s;tic Hours, and are no Incumbrance abroad; they protract the Midnight-hour, are our Fellow-Travellers in foreign Parts, and make the be&s;t Part of Equipage in all our rural Excur&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>I am aware, that the Tran&s;lation, which I have here offered, falls many Degrees &s;hort of the Purity and graceful Strength of the Original; but &s;uch as it is, it may, in &s;ome Sort, &s;erve to inculcate the real Utility of a very plea&s;urable Occupation, which is at pre&s;ent too much neglected by People of Condition of both Sexes. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> wonders how Men of Sen&s;e can &s;pend &s;o many Hours together, without receiving any other Ideas than what are &s;ugge&s;ted, by an Arrangement of black
<PB N="176" REF="179">and red Spots. But &s;uch is the prevailing Fa&s;hion of the Times, that the <HI>Book of Four Kings</HI> is the only <HI>Vo|lume</HI> at pre&s;ent peru&s;ed with any Degree of Attention, and, I will venture to affirm, the <HI>Four motley Monarchs,</HI> are better beloved by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Condition than any <HI>real King</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> A Friend of mine, who has a Knock in conforming all his Compo&s;itions to the pre|vailing Ta&s;te of the Town, tells me very &s;eriou&s;ly, that he has often wondered how Men of Di&s;cernment can &s;it down to Performances, which a little Experience Light inform them will never be read; &s;uch as, the <HI>History of England,</HI> the <HI>Life of Harry the Seventh,</HI> the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Charles the Fir&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Lewis the Four|teenth,</HI> &amp;c For his Part, he is determined to avail him|&s;elf of the favourite Pa&s;&s;ions of his Readers, and is now actually employed in <HI>compiling Memoirs</HI> of the KING OF EPADES, the Annals of the KING OF CLUBS, Anec|dotes relating to the KING OF HEARTS, Remarks on the KING OF DIAMONDS, including Battles more me|morable than tho&s;e of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i</HI> and <HI>Poitiers,</HI> fought in the verdant Plains of <HI>Picquet, Cribbidge, Quadrille, Whi&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. in which will be interwoven the private Characters of the <HI>Knaves,</HI> with the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Queens,</HI> their Intrigues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Work to be publi&s;hed in Numbers, Price One Guinea each Weekly Number; in proper Places will be in&s;erted a beautiful Copper-Plate of the <HI>Crowned-Heads and eminent Per&s;onages,</HI> taken from the original Drawings now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Club at White</HI>'s; at the particular De&s;ire of &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, five Thou&s;and Copies will be printed upon Royal Paper; the Sub&s;cribers Names to be annexed with their Places of Abode, and how many Card-Tables each Per&s;on keeps, which may &s;erve to give Po&s;terity &s;ome Idea of the Grandeur of the pre&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>I make no Doubt but this Work, if carried into Exe|cution, will be in great Demand, and, I am &s;en&s;ible, that a Di&s;ina&s;ive from Pur&s;uits of this Nature will be the
<PB N="177" REF="180">Je&s;t of every tittering Card-Table in Town. I mu&s;t, however, beg Leave to inform my pretty Readers, that they are highly mi&s;taken, if they imagine, that, by de|dicating a few Hours to litterary Amu&s;ements, they en|danger their lovely Features, and run a Ri&s;que of dim|ming the &s;parkling Lu&s;tre of the Eye. On the con|trary, a Page or two in a Morning may &s;erve to adju&s;t the Countenance, and the Acqui&s;ition of a new Idea may give a more engaging Ornament to the Head, than a new <HI>Paris</HI> Cap, and the Eye will certainly beam with more Attention, when directed by an active Principle within, than when it &s;wims round the Room in pretty, giddy, vain, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Affectations? How &s;inely has Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> de&s;cribed the Con&s;equences attending a Life &s;pent thus in a Circle of Follic.!

<L><HI>Alive, ridiculous!&mdash;and dead, for got.&mdash;</HI></L></Q> How much more eligible therefore is it to employ &s;ome Portions of our Time in a Way, that will furni&s;h the Mind with Ideas fit to be communicated to rational Crea|tures, and give an Embelli&s;hment to the highe&s;t Sphere of Life. Add to this, that &s;oftening Quality, which Let|ters have in all Ca&s;es of Adver&s;ity. In the Day of Affliction, the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t certain Relief the Mind can receive, will be derived from the Habit of being conver&s;ant with Books. If I remember right. it is Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> that ob&s;erves, in his <HI>Conduct of the Under&s;tanding,</HI> that a Power of transferring our Thoughts from one Object to another, is an E&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite in a well|formed Under&s;tanding. And &s;urely nothing can better help to prevent the Mind from dwelling too long upon any habitual Set of Ideas, which may induce a &s;ettled
<PB N="178" REF="181">Form of Melancholy, than an Attention to the Perfor|mances, which Men of learned Lei&s;ure have &s;ent into the World. In&s;tead of urging any Thing further on this Subject, I &s;hall conclude this Paper with a <HI>Journal for one Week</HI> of an Acquaintance of mine who never reads at all, and a <HI>Journal</HI> of another who devotes Part of his Time to Letters.</P>

<BIBL><HI>HOR.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Nil admirari prop&eacute; res e&s;t &s;ola, Namuci,</L>

<P>_NOT to admire, is the golden Rule, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by <HI>Horace,</HI> for the Acquirement of inward Peace and Happine&s;s, and al&s;o for &s;ecuring the Tenure of them, when once obtained. The &s;ame Precept may al&s;o be enforced as the &s;ure&s;t Method to form a &s;ound Under&s;tanding, and to pre&s;erve the Judgment free and undi&s;tempered. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m,</HI> a Poem, in which good Sen&s;e and Poetry are beautifully combined, has given this Ob&s;ervation the Sanction of a Maxim;
<Q><HI>For Fools</HI> ADMIRE, but Men of Sen&s;e APPROVE.</Q>
<PB N="182" REF="185">In our greener Years indeed, when the young Affections are, to u&s;e the Poet's Phra&s;e, <HI>tremblingly alive all o'er,</HI> when every Object pre&s;ents it&s;elf in &s;ome new and &s;trik|ing Attitude, fond ADIMRATION may be then allowed to gaze, and each Incident in the Scene of Life may call forth the juvenile Expre&s;&s;ions of Wonder and A&s;to|ni&s;hment. But &s;urely, when we become &s;omewhat hackneyed in the Ways of Men, when Habit has coated over that Quickne&s;s of Sen&s;ation, which attends the raw and inexperienced Mind, the elevated Brow of Amazement may be expected to &s;ub&s;ide to the &s;ober Ca&s;t of Reflection and Knowledge. I am at pre&s;ent ac|quainted with a Gentleman, who has made &s;o many &s;en&s;ible Animadver&s;ions on the various Occurrences of Life, that, I am convinced, nothing can arrive to excite in his Brea&s;t any Emotions of Surprize, and I have often heard him &s;ay very humorou&s;ly, <Q>Lord! I have already known &s;o many unexpected Turns and Revolutions of Things, that were I to &s;ee the MONUMENT walk down <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and take out St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church to dance a Minuet, it would make no Manner of Im|pre&s;&s;ion on my Spirits, no more than when I read that it will be High-Water at <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> at half pa&s;t Ten.</Q></P>
<P>But in the general Ma&s;s of Life, there is &s;uch a la|mentable Inanity in the Minds of mo&s;t People, and the Gro&s;s of Mankind are &s;o &s;cantily furni&s;hed with Ideas, that there are but few, who, when taken from their ma|nual Occupations, or their other Bu&s;ine&s;s, do not fall into a &s;luggi&s;h O&s;citancy, for want of a Sufficiency of Matter to employ their intellectual Faculties. Thus by an habitual Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in reviewing the ordinary No|tices of Things, the Power of arranging and comparing our Ideas in their manifold Relations to each other, which we commonly call JUDGMENT, lies indolently dormant, and the Con&s;equence is, that, upon every Emergence, the idle Pa&s;&s;ions of A&s;toni&s;hment take
<PB N="183" REF="186">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Soul. It is ob&s;ervable, that, this Di&s;|ea&s;e is not always confined to the unenlightened Part of Mankind, but we may &s;ometimes perceive this mental Debility among tho&s;e, who, from their Education, and from their Intercour&s;e with the World, might be ex|pected to be &s;omewhat more &s;olid. There are, perhaps, in the Circle of my own Acquaintance, at lea&s;t half a &s;core Per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Talents capable of exten&s;ive Di&s;cernment, and of thinking very ju&s;tly upon any or|dinary Topics of Conver&s;ation, and yet, through an Habit of Inattention, &s;uch a total Relaxation un&s;trings their intellectual Powers, that they in Fact appear to have impotently pinned their Faith on other Mens Sleeves, and to have lo&s;t all Kind of Capacity of judg|ing for them&s;elves. It is among &s;uch People, and &s;uch only, that THE COMICAL FELLOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, whom I have de&s;cribed in a former Paper, ac|quires his prodigious Reputation for Wit and Humour. Sir <HI>Andrew Wonderful</HI> has for &s;ome Time pa&s;t been e&s;teemed a knowing one by his Neighbours in the Ward of <HI>Farringdon without,</HI> and in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, he is accounted a Man of very notable Dexterity; but &s;pend the Evening with Sir <HI>Andrew</HI> at any Tavern on the St. <HI>James</HI>'s Side of <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> and he is all Amazement from the Time he enters the Room, until his old, rumbling Coach conveys him back to the City. If you mention to him the Lie of the Day, that the Lady of a certain noble Lord was caught in Bed with a Lieutenant of the Guards, <Q>Good Law! &s;ays Sir <HI>Andrew,</HI> you dont &s;ay &s;o!</Q>&mdash;It's very true though, and this Morn|ing early a well-dre&s;&s;ed Man walking acro&s;s <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Fields</HI> fell down dead&mdash;<Q>Dear Heart, &s;ays the Knight, you &s;urprize me!</Q>&mdash;Late la&s;t Night a Game at <HI>Whi&s;t</HI> was played at <HI>White</HI>'s Chocolate-hou&s;e, on which upwards of three thou&s;and Pounds depended&mdash;<Q>Three thou&s;and Pounds! I never heard of &s;uch a Thing in
<PB N="184" REF="187">my born Days&mdash;three thou&s;and Pounds!&mdash;Good Law!&mdash;Three thou&s;and Pounds!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Every Man, who is actuated with the laudable Am|bition of being a rational Creature, &s;hould endeavour to fix within him&s;elf &s;uch Habits of thinking, as will keep him collected, and prevent his Thoughts from being &s;cattered into wild Surprize upon every little Emergence that offers. There &s;hould certainly be cheri&s;hed in every Brea&s;t an hone&s;t Pride in pre&s;erving its own free Agency, and maintaining an Independency of Under&s;tanding, &s;elf-impelled, and &s;elf-directed; awakened into think|ing by the Impre&s;&s;ions of its own Ideas, and adopting all its Principles and Maxims from the Sugge&s;tions of its own Judgment. For &s;urely there can not be any Thing more unmanly, than leaving either the Faculties of the Soul, or the Mu&s;cles of the Face to be played upon by the Will and Plea&s;ure of another. To have a Titter ready whenever the COMICAL FELLOW chu&s;es to be facetious, and to hold a Man's Belief at another's Di&s;po&s;al, according as he chu&s;es to decide upon any Subject, mo&s;t inconte&s;tibly indicates a weak and frivo|lous Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I was led into this Tract of Thought by a Reflec|tion on the Manner, in which I &s;pent an Evening, this Week, with three Gentlemen, who had &s;ollicited the Meeting with earne&s;t Importunity. During the la&s;t &s;ix Weeks, I never met any one of them, but he in&s;tantly began, <Q>Well! my dear Boy, when &s;hall we have an Evening&mdash;you know it is what we have long wi&s;hed for?</Q>&mdash;At length the <HI>Rendezvous</HI> was fixed, and at the appointed Hour I met my Friends, not without very high Expectations of a plea&s;ant Evening. A Bottle of <HI>Allen</HI>'s in an In&s;tant appeared on the Table, and circu|lated with uncommon Celerity. I then expected my Friends to open &s;ome Vein of Di&s;cour&s;e, but all con|tinuing in determined Silence, in order to break the Ice, I began with an ordinary Topic, and enquired about
<PB N="185" REF="188"><HI>Elizabeth Canning.</HI> <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, the Govern|ment is re&s;olved to let her &s;ee foreign Parts.</Q>&mdash; That's <HI>Humour,</HI> &s;aid one of the Gentleman to his next Neighbour, and then they all bur&s;t into a loud Laugh. I did not perceive the Joke, but, continued I. <Q>whe|ther &s;he is guilty or not, it will do her no Prejudice to &s;ee the World.</Q>&mdash;"<HI>Humour</HI> again," &s;ays the Gen|tleman who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me; <Q>You're a fine young Fellow,</Q> &s;ays a &s;econd; "This is high," &s;ays the third, and then all three formed a Chorus of Laughter. "The Captain, who carries her abroad," added I, <Q>will have a good Contract of it; for he need give her nothing but Cru&s;ts and Water for &s;ix and twenty Days, and &s;he'll &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon that.</Q> <HI>Another Touch,</HI> &s;ays my Friend over the Way. <HI>Admirable!</HI> cries his Neighbour, and the Gentleman next to me, alarming me with a Slap on the Shoulder, roars out&mdash;"Odzouns," and then <HI>Laughter, holding both his Sides,</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them for the Space of ten Minutes.</P>
<P>Upon this, I perceived, that my Company held more of ADMIRATION, than of JUDGMENT, and I became heartily tired of the Party; though, were I inclined to Self-Approbation, they omitted nothing that could ad|mini&s;ter to my Vanity; the Gentleman oppo&s;ite to me frequently te&s;tifying his Approbation with that's <HI>Hu|mour!</HI> the &s;econd, repeating, <HI>you're a fine young Fellow!</HI> and my next Neighbour thundering in my Ear his rap|turous <HI>Odzouns!</HI> which extraordinary Interjections were ab&s;olutely the Sum total of all the Conver&s;ation, that I heard from the&s;e three notable Blanks in the Creation. I accordingly took occa&s;ion to break up the Meeting as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and upon retiring home to my Chambers could not help drawing up this loo&s;e E&s;&s;ay, which I have ordered my Publi&s;her to &s;end to each of the Gentlemen, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to cure them of their &s;ervile Ad|miration, and inform them, if they de&s;ire to be ranked
<PB N="186" REF="189">among Free-Agents, that their only Title to it con&s;i&s;ts in thinking and judging for them&s;elves.</P>

<P>WERE I not to inform you, you would certainly never be able to gue&s;s at what Hour I have now &s;et down to write to you, It is now almo&s;t Six in the Morning, and I have already &s;pent half an Hour in an agreeable Attention to &s;ome certain dome&s;tic Cares, which have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me &s;ince my Retreat to the Country. I am here a Kind of <HI>Pater-familias</HI> with all my little Brood of Hens and Chickens around me. I look upon my&s;elf to be greatly intere&s;ted in their Wel|fare; their Wants, and their Inconveniencies it is my earne&s;t Care to remove. I am entirely conver&s;ant with their different Tempers, and can tell you the ruling Pa&s;|&s;ions of each of them. I can here &s;hew a <HI>Bantham</HI> Co|quette, and a Prude from the other Side of the Line; among the Males I have a Coxcomb, a Bully, a Coward, and, in &s;hort, almo&s;t all the Characters that offer in hu|man Life.</P>
<P>Since my ri&s;ing from my Pillow, I have interpo&s;ed in two violent Feuds, and in this Manner am I enter|taining my&s;elf, while my Friend <HI>Ranger</HI> is, perhaps, reeling home from &s;ome Tavern; or, it may be, like your admired <HI>Horace,</HI> tumbling and to&s;&s;ing in re&s;tle&s;s Impatience for the Arrival of &s;ome delu&s;ive Fair, who&s;e Per&s;idy has carried her to a Rival's Arm's.

Give me leave here to addre&s;s you in the Words of the excellent Author of the Sea&s;ons.

I dare believe not &s;ince we were together at <HI>Eaton.</HI> But &s;urely, if this Phaenomenon had not very expan&s;ive Beauties, the Poets would never have been &s;o fond of &s;eizing every Opportunity to de&s;cribe it. Since I have mentioned this Circum&s;tance among the Poets, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that our great Dramatic Bard has in two Pa&s;&s;ages excelled all the Writers from the Days of <HI>Homer,</HI> down to the pre&s;ent State of modern Poetry, in their favourite Openings of the Morn. The Saffron|tinctured Fingers of <HI>Aurora,</HI> the Sun ri&s;ing from <HI>Thetis</HI>'s Lap, the Daughter of the Dawn coming from the Bed of <HI>Tithonus,</HI> are, in my Opinion, all poor and ineffectual, when compared with the more natural De&s;cription in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet;</HI>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;Jocund Day</HI></L>
<L><HI>Stands tiptoe on the mi&s;ty Mountain's Top.</HI></L></Q> I have compared this admirable Piece of Imagery, for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Mornings, with the real Object in Na|ture, and I really am at a Lo&s;s which to admire mo&s;t; like the travelling <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> who, when the Reflection of the &s;olar Rays (as happens &s;ometimes in tho&s;e Countries)
<PB N="190" REF="193">have formed in a Cloud another imaginary Sun, gazes at both with reverential Eyes, in doubt with him&s;elf to which he &s;hall offer his Morning Adoration. The &s;e|cond Pa&s;&s;age I mean, is, in the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where after &s;eeing the Gho&s;t of the decea&s;ed King, <HI>Horatio</HI> breaks off with,
<Q><L><HI>But &s;ee the Morn in Ru&s;&s;et-mantle clad.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Walks o'er the Dews of yon high ea&s;tern Hill.</HI></L></Q> You know the Poets are fond of per&s;onalizing both phy&s;ical and moral Qualities, in order to give Anima|tion to their Poetry, and to throw Things as much as po&s;&s;ible into Action; and here, &s;urely, we have that creative Figure in its high Perfection; the whole Pic|ture could not receive finer Colourings from the Hand of <HI>Titian;</HI> the Drapery is beautiful, and the Action in which this poetical Being is repre&s;ented, is admirably de&s;criptive of the fir&s;t Dawnings of the Day.&mdash;</P>
<P>My, Dear <HI>Ranger,</HI> come, and let us critici&s;e upon this Phenomenon; let us enjoy that Delight, which the Mind takes in comparing the Objects of Imitation, with the Fini&s;hings of mimic Art. Let me a&s;&s;ure you, that to &s;ee this gradual Expan&s;ion of the &s;olar Influence on the Face of Nature, will give &s;uch a calm Flow of Spi|rits for the en&s;uing Vocations of the Day, as cannot be experienced in a City Life. You will po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay, you had rather loiter in your Chambers, than endure the in|tolerable Rage of the Sun tending to his meridian Height. In this Ca&s;e, <HI>Richmond-Park</HI> affords its nmbrageous Walks, where the Noontide Ray has no Acce&s;s. How &s;weet here to lo&s;e one&s;elf in plea&s;ing Error, to re|cline under an impervious Shade! and there in lettered Indolence conver&s;e with <HI>Maro, Tully, Pope, Shake&s;pear, Milton, Spencer;</HI> or with <HI>Waller</HI> cry out,
<Q><L><HI>O! how I long my carele&s;s Limbs to lay</HI></L>
<L><HI>Under a plantane Shade, and all the Day</HI></L>
<L><HI>With am'rous Airs my Fancy entertain!</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="191" REF="194">Or, if inclined to diver&s;ify the Scene, and ramble about in gentle Exerci&s;e, what Place &s;o fit as the&s;e very Gar|dens, which afford all the Variety in Nature? Do you delight in trim Hedges, uniform Vi&s;tas, &s;mooth Pa&s;tures, and &s;tudied Regularity? Your Ta&s;te may here find enough to gratify it. Or are you rather like the Per&s;on of a truer Sen&s;e of Things de&s;cribed by <HI>Martial, Rure vero barbaroque laetatur,</HI> one who likes true Country, rude, barbarous, and un&s;poiled by the Elegancies of Art? Here you are &s;uddenly &s;urprized to find your&s;elf upon a barren Heath, lo&s;t to the World, and nothing pre|&s;ents it&s;elf to View, but the withered Shrub, and the bla&s;ted Clump of Trees, and Hares and Rabbits run|ning athwart the dreary Scene. From hence, it may be, you wander into &s;ome Fore&s;t, and hear the Wood|man at his Labour; then i&s;&s;ue out upon the ploughed Land, and behold around you nothing but bu&s;y Tokens of rural Indu&s;try; then, led by the Hand of Contempla|tion, lo&s;e your&s;elf in the Solitude of the Hermitage, or wander into
<Q><L><HI>The Thru&s;h-haunted Coppice, where lightly leaps</HI></L>
<L><HI>The fearful Fawn the ru&s;tling Leaves along.</HI></L></Q> If, at length, you are &s;atisfied with this Retreat, <HI>Rich|mond-Hill</HI> invites your Steps, from whence you may command a boundle&s;s Pro&s;pect of all the Country round. There Villas, &s;tately Buildings, Groves, Meadows, the Woodland, fertile Pa&s;tures, Hills and Vales offer them|&s;elves to the Sight in mixed Variety. The barren Heath, and the Sun-burnt craggy Soil appear with all tho&s;e Sof|tenings to the Eye, which Di&s;tance throws upon a Land|&s;cape; and Nature all around appears with all her &s;tri|king Maje&s;ty and all her &s;ofter Graces.</P>
<P>To crown the Whole, at the Bottom of the Hill <HI>Thames</HI> expands his rural Stream. To pur&s;ue it in its &s;e|veral Windings, fertilizing the Country round, is at once a Refre&s;hment to the Eye, and the con&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="192" REF="195">of new Objects, takes off from that Stillne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e over&s;pread the Whole. Here, my Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> we enjoy that Tranquillity of which <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;peaks &s;o feelingly; here we have Innocence, living Lakes embowering Shades, indolent Repo&s;e be|neath an Arbour, and the Mowing of the Cows; Mu|&s;ick, believe me, far preferable to the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> or a City Concert. Be&s;ides this, let me a&s;&s;ure you, you will find the Mu&s;es more coming Girls here, than in the Noi&s;e, and Smoke of <HI>London.</HI> But, I fear I have length|ened this Letter beyond all Bounds; I can only tell you after an eminent <HI>French</HI> Writer, had I Time enough, I would make it &s;horter; but take it as it is, loo&s;e, ram|bling, and de&s;ultory, and believe me to be,</P>

<P>_AFTER having peru&s;ed the new Tragedy of <HI>Creu&s;a,</HI> with all that Plea&s;ure which re|&s;ults from a well-conducted Story, and in|tere&s;ting Situations of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;o|nae,</HI> I was at length &s;truck in a very particular Manner with the &s;econd Epilogue, which the Author has an|nexed to it. A Parliament of Women &s;ugge&s;ts many Ideas of a plea&s;ant Nature to the Fancy, and there is a Variety in the Turn of Expre&s;&s;ion, for which this little
<PB N="194" REF="197">Piece may very ju&s;tly be called a pretty Compo&s;ition. Having laid a&s;ide the Book, I found that the female Hou&s;e of Commons had taken entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Imagination; I fancied to my&s;elf, to &s;ee my amiable Countrywomen engaged in a deep Debate; the lovely <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> carried on their Party-Divi&s;ions with great Warmth and vehement Elocution; the Words <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> Intere&s;t, <HI>Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, Patrioti&s;m, Virtue, Bribery</HI> and <HI>Corruption, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property, free uninfluenced Election, arbitrary Power,</HI> with a long <HI>Et caetera</HI> of Phra&s;es, were methought banded about by the&s;e beautiful Repre&s;entatives, with as much Zeal and Impetuo&s;ity, as ever they could po&s;&s;ibly have been from the Days of <HI>Hampdex</HI> down to the pre&s;ent happy Period. Their Fans. I imagined, prettily diver&s;ified with va|rious emblematical Figures; and, in&s;tead of love-&s;ick Virgins, Je&s;&s;amine Bowers, Rural Swains playing on the Flute, they di&s;played to View nothing but Scaffold|ings, Executions, Scenes of Broils and Battles, Sea|pieces, embattled Squadrons, the Spirit-&s;tirring Drum, as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has it, the <HI>Ear-piercing Fife,</HI> the <HI>Royal-Banner,</HI> and <HI>every Circum&s;tance of glorious War.</HI> The Patch no longer &s;erved as a mere Embelli&s;hment of Beauty, but carried with it a very expre&s;&s;ive Energy, and denoted the Attachments of the Ladies to the Court or Country-Party. <HI>Blue</HI> and <HI>Yellow</HI> Ribbons adorned the Head-Dre&s;s, and hung out a Kind of Flag of De|fiance to the oppo&s;ite Party. Elections were &s;trongly conte&s;ted all over the Kingdom: The <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Now Intere&s;t</HI> cla&s;hed in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> and ended at la&s;t in a double Return. In <HI>Kent</HI> a Lady of antient and ho|nourable Family was thrown out. The People of <HI>Bri|&s;tol</HI> paid a voluntary Compliment to a Lady of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Genius, who had been in&s;trumental in bring|inging <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Stone-Buckles into Fa&s;hion. After a very
<PB N="195" REF="198">warm Conte&s;t for the City of <HI>London,</HI> upon finally clo|&s;ing the Poll the Numbers &s;tood thus;

<P>Whereupon the four fir&s;t were declared duly elected, and the la&s;t mention'd Lady, it was &s;aid, would be brought in for &s;ome other Place at the Recommendation of an old Dutche&s;s at Court. The Writs being all re|turned. I &s;uppo&s;ed the Parliament a&s;&s;embled, the Ladies in the Upper-Hou&s;e, and the Commoners in the Lower. The Female Commons immediately proceeded to chu&s;e a Speaker, which was a Point of great Difficulty, every one being eager for that Office, upon a Suppo&s;ition, that the Speaker was to have the large&s;t Share of the Debate; but being undeceived in this Point, the Matter was at length adju&s;ted, and they then went upon Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. As &s;everal Occurrences offered them&s;elves to my Thoughts on this Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall throw the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this Part of my waking Dream, into the Form made U&s;e of on the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>In the Days when the Empire of <HI>Bagdad</HI> &s;pread Ter|ror round the Nations, and their conquering Arms added a con&s;tant Acce&s;&s;ion of Honour and Wealth to the Califfs, <HI>Aboulca&s;em,</HI> a Youth of exten&s;ive Parts and boundle&s;s Ambition, had the Addre&s;s to rai&s;e him&s;elf to the fir&s;t Honours of the State, and in Proce&s;s of Time, he arrived to the Dignity of Vizier. In this Office his Conduct was &s;uch as might be expected from a Per&s;on of his exalted Parts. His Renown for Genius and a bright Under&s;tanding di&s;tingui&s;hed him above the Re&s;t of the Mini&s;ters, and the Name of <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> was wafted on the Wings of Fame through all the Regions of the La&s;t.</P>
<P>But amid&s;t all the Effulgence of his Glory, <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> was hurried away by the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ions, which were rapid as the Cataracts of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and vio|lent as the Whirlwinds in the De&s;art. His Soul was apt to kindle into a Blaze at the Sight of Beauty, and in the Height of his national Bu&s;ine&s;s he would
<PB N="201" REF="204">frequently &s;port away his Hours in wanton Dalliance with a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Beauty, with whom he would often betake him&s;elf to the Baths, and there, in amorous Di&s;|&s;ipation, write Letters upon Matters of the utmo&s;t Con|&s;equence to the <HI>Califf,</HI> and the whole Empire of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> and di&s;patch them to his Agents, whom he had &s;ent to other neighbouring Courts. At length, he was &s;u&s;pected to favour the Cau&s;e of the bani&s;hed Prince <HI>Abdallah,</HI> who was then wandering about the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and though no convincing Proofs could be alledged again&s;t him, yet not being able to vindicate him&s;elf from the Imputation, he was obliged to fly his Country.</P>
<P><HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> immediately betook him&s;elf to the Prince <HI>Abdallah,</HI> and finding his Cau&s;e totally ruined, without any Po&s;&s;ibility of re-in&s;tating him, he then exerted all his Indu&s;try to obtain Leave to return home. As Things of this Nature cannot be compa&s;&s;ed in a &s;hort Time, in order to hinder his Mind in the mean Time from falling a Prey to Melancholy, and all the Horrors of di&s;ap|pointed Ambition, he applied him&s;elf to the Labours of the wi&s;e Men in order to relieve his Mind. Here he penned his Thoughts upon Exile, and many other im|portant Points of &s;peculative Morality. He lived like an Hermit in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and there, illu&s;tri|ou&s;ly hid, he carried on his Re&s;earches into the Study of Nature, Hi&s;tory, and all the Branches of human Learning which could adorn and enrich &s;o accompli&s;h|ed a Mind.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;hed with all mental Embelli&s;hments, <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> was in Time permitted to return, but he was not re&s;tored to his Honours. As Ambition is ever un|relenting, he was no &s;ooner fixed in his own Abode, than he in&s;tantly became an implacable Enemy to the Vizier, who had con&s;ented to recal him. He drew from the Stores of Knowledge, which he had formerly trea&s;ured up, &s;ome of the &s;evere&s;t Reflections, which could be made upon the Mini&s;ter's Admini&s;trations, and
<PB N="202" REF="205">this in &s;uch a powerful Strain of nervous Eloquence, that he may very ju&s;tly be &s;aid to have had a great Share in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ownfal. <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> was &s;o happy as to have accompli&s;hed this Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was for a long Time the grand Object of his Intentions; but it was no &s;ooner done, than he perceived him&s;elf as di&s;tant as ever from re-gaining his Prince's Ear. He therefore betook him&s;elf to his Country-Hou&s;e at a &s;mall Di|&s;tance from <HI>Bagdad,</HI> where he employed him&s;elf in reading all the Morali&s;ts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and in &s;hort, all the fine Ea&s;tern Writers. In this Rece&s;s he cultivated an Acquaintance with two of the fir&s;t Geniu&s;es of his Time, <HI>Selim</HI> and <HI>Mirza;</HI> the former was remarkable among the Ea&s;tern Sages for elevated Strains of Poetry, and the latter for tho&s;e Oriental Tales, which are generally called the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> and the Adventures of <HI>Gulli|ver,</HI> the Merchant of <HI>Bagdad.</HI> The&s;e two undertook the Defence of <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI>'s Character, and &s;pared no Pains to blazon his Fame to the World.</P>
<P>Mean Time <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> pur&s;ued his Re&s;earches into all the Branches of human Wi&s;dom; the civil Polity of States was to him a Store-hou&s;e, which di&s;clo&s;ed a con|&s;tant Fund of Supply; he then turned his Eye inwards upon the Texture and Make of his own Mind; he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the Mind was a concealed Repo&s;itory of Riches, and that it behoved every Man to find out the Secrets of it; this accordingly he did; but he did not enjoy the &s;ecret, &s;elfi&s;h Gratification of many, who, when in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Trea&s;ure will never let it be &s;een by human Eyes; on the contrary, he was glad to have every Opportunity of di&s;playing him&s;elf, and this ra|ther to a Degree of O&s;tentation; from this Branch of Study <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> proceeded to examine into Matters of Religion; the various Sy&s;tems of the Ea&s;tern Sages were all to him perfectly well known; he laughed at the <HI>Keran;</HI> the Sy&s;tem of Morality which <HI>Confucius</HI> taught, <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> held in Contempt; <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Paradi&s;e was
<PB N="203" REF="206">to him a mere <HI>Chimaera,</HI> and he declaimed with a pompous Flow of &s;ounding Eloquence again&s;t all the&s;e various Opinions; the <HI>Bramins</HI> were always the Ob|jects of his &s;evere&s;t Contempt; in the Dictates of natural Religion, he would &s;ay, we have no Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Guides, and in the Explanation of e&s;tabli&s;hed Forms, they are highly dangerous; he was an Enemy to all Forms of Wor&s;hip offered in the Temple of the Pro|phet; he endeavoured to &s;ubvert the Principles upon which this Wor&s;hip was founded, and to introduce a new Form of Thinking of his own. Since <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> could have no Share in the Direction of State-Affairs, he was determined to &s;oar above &s;ublunary Things, and to have the Lead in Matters of higher Importance. He was highly dogmatical in his A&s;&s;ertions, and he carried his Extravagance &s;o far, as to advance, that there was no Difference between the human Species and Brutes; and that it was highly probable that Dogs and the re&s;t of the animal Creation were endued with Souls as well as Mankind; and in the general he a&s;&s;erted that all Souls were material.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e Di&s;qui&s;itions, <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> was &s;itting one Night in his Study, his Lamp burning be|fore him, when of a &s;udden, Thunders rolled deep and awful over his Head; the Mountains were &s;haken and they groaned; keen Lightenings fla&s;hed athwart the Hemi&s;phere; the third Heaven was opened, and a Flood of Radiance de&s;cended upon the Earth. The So|lemnity of the Scene appalled the Heart of <HI>Aboulca&s;em;</HI> Trembling &s;eized his Limbs; he fell pro&s;trate and adored the Me&s;&s;enger from God, who now &s;tood before him, and &s;poke in Accents, which chilled the Blood within him, and made him &s;tand convinced of his vain Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Aboulca&s;em,</HI> &s;aid he, receive my Sayings with an Ear of Attention. Know then, that the Eye of him, who is in the third Heaven hath beheld thee; he hath
<PB N="204" REF="207">viewed thy Ways with Compa&s;&s;ion, and he hath made this Vi&s;ion a Vehicle of In&s;truction unto thy Soul, which is at pre&s;ent lo&s;t and bewildered in a Maze of idle and fooli&s;h Philo&s;ophy; for thy Philo|&s;ophy is not calculated to advance true Knowledge, Virtue, and Wi&s;dom, but has its Source in O&s;ten|tation. O&s;tentation and Vain-glory have induced thee to di&s;play thy imagined Superiority of Parts, which pretends to pervade all Sy&s;tems of Religion, and thy Heart's Conceit will approve of none. Thy Studies are ill directed, and their Dri&s;t is only to alienate the Minds of Men from any &s;ettled Form of Wor&s;hip, which you are in the Wrong to di&s;turb, as your own In&s;ufficiency cannot &s;ub&s;titute a better than what is de&s;igned to keep Society in a due Sen&s;e of Re&s;igna|tion to a Supreme Being, and to pre&s;erve the Bands of civil Compact religiou&s;ly unbroken. Ca&s;t but thine Eye upon yonder Vale; behold what is there tran&s;acted. There thou may'&s;t &s;ee Men dive&s;ted of all Forms of Wor&s;hip, and rendered perfectly con|formable to thy vain Notions of Religion. There thou may'&s;t &s;ee what is the State of Man ungoverned by &s;ettled Forms of Devotion; they have &s;haken off all Regard to the Prophet, and behold them immer&s;ed in all Manner of vicious Practices. Uncontrouled they invade each other's Rights; they make War to gratify their Ambition; freely without Re&s;traint they pro&s;cribe whom they plea&s;e; the Bonds of Society are broken, and the Contempt of divine Laws has introduced a Contempt for all human In&s;titutions. To promote this Scene of Confu&s;ion are thy Writings calculated, but know, and dread the Truth I am now to utter, that it will better behove thee to pay Submi&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Forms of Wor&s;hip of thy Country, than to di&s;turb the Peace of the Faithful, and thereby fill their Minds with Doubt, with Jealou&s;y,
<PB N="205" REF="208">Mi&s;tru&s;t, Su&s;picion, and all the Horrors of an over|weening Imagination.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e Words the Radiance, which &s;poke, with|drew from his Eyes, and left <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation; the Impre&s;&s;ion was, however, very &s;oon effaced; for notwith&s;tanding this Admonition, he per|&s;evered in his ill De&s;igns; but the Thread of his Days was cut &s;hort before he could vent them abroad into the World. However, his Intentions were not totally fru|&s;trated, for the Hand of Death had no &s;ooner &s;mote him, than his Compo&s;itions fell into the Hands of <HI>Namahran,</HI> another Ea&s;tern Writer, who &s;old them for a certain Number of Sequins of Gold, and by tho&s;e Means the Writings of <HI>Aboulca&s;em</HI> came into every Body's Hands, and &s;pread their baneful Influence on the Minds of all the Inhabitants of <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Vere magis, quia Vere calor redit o&s;&s;ibus&mdash;
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE gloomy Month of <HI>November</HI> is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by Foreigners, as the Heighth of the Sea&s;on for <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to hang and drown them&s;elves; but from a diligent Ob&s;ervation I can venture to affirm, that the Month of <HI>May</HI> is always attended with a larger Bill of Mortality than any other Part of the Year. It is the Spring-Time of Love, when the Blood has received a Renovation of Warmth, and young Minds are then more ea&s;ily melted down in the amorous Fire. A Book&s;eller, whom I now and then chat with at his <HI>Circulating Library,</HI> informs me, that he can tell when the Poi&s;on of Love begins to rankle in the Brea&s;t, that he can trace it in its Pro|gre&s;s, and knows exactly when it is become quite ge|neral in its Influence. Romances, he &s;ays, in the Be|ginning are more and more call'd for; as it encrea&s;es, Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s Love Letters, the Loves of <HI>Octavia</HI> and <HI>Philander, Abelard</HI> and <HI>Eloi&s;e,</HI> Letters from a <HI>Nun to a Cavalier,</HI> &amp;c. come into Play; and when the Infec|tion is grown Epidemic, then the Tragedies of <HI>Romeo and Juliet, All for Love, or the World well lo&s;t,
<PB N="207" REF="210">Theodo&s;ius or the Force of Love,</HI> &amp;c, cannot be &s;upplied quick enough to an&s;wer the wonderful Demand for them. My ingenious Friend will &s;ometimes take me into his back Room, and "Friend <HI>Ranger,</HI>" &s;ays he, <Q>can't you touch us up &s;ome &s;ecret Memoirs, or a Love-Tale, or &s;omething by Way of Novel&mdash;If green Peas come in fa&s;t&mdash;the Sea&s;on for Peas is always favourable to love-&s;ick Minds&mdash;I can manage to put you off&mdash; let me &s;ee&mdash;ay, about a couple of thou&s;and by Mid|&s;ummer&mdash;yes, thereabouts&mdash;I could get&mdash;if you will put your Name to it,&mdash;a matter of fifteen hundred &s;ub&s;cribed among the Trade&mdash;how will you make it end?&mdash;happy or unhappy?&mdash;for there will be a Difference in that&mdash;but, that mu&s;t be determined by the Chapter of Accidents&mdash;a North-Ea&s;t Wind chills the amorous Heat&mdash;in that Ca&s;e, you had bet|ter make them die&mdash;but, if the &s;outhern Gale con|tinues, they may in the Conclu&s;ion be <HI>conducted by the laughing Loves to the nuptial Bower</HI>&mdash;the Book will &s;oon be in every Body's Hands, at <HI>Tunbridge, Bath, Scarborough, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus is this &s;kilful Per&s;on in his Trade for taking Advantage of that Succe&s;&s;ion of Foibles, which are con&s;tantly ri&s;ing and falling in the mo&s;t whim&s;ical Vi|ci&s;&s;itude in this Metropolis. The Truth of it is the Play-hou&s;es, the Circulating Libraries, the public Gar|dens about Town owe very much of their Succe&s;s to the love-&s;ick Minds of Boys and Girls. It is this uni|ver&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion which rolls &s;o many of the Youth of both Sexes down the &s;oft Declivity in <HI>Greenwich-Park;</HI> it is this which is &s;o fond of taking cold at the Tin Ca&s;cade in <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> Gardens, and it is this which pours forth &s;o many Groupes of Enamoratos along the Fields and Meadows about <HI>London</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the exten&s;ive Influence of this &s;oft Infection, it is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing that among all the Writers, who have endeavoured to de&s;cribe it, very few
<PB N="208" REF="211">of them have &s;ucceeded in any tolerable Degree. What Numbers of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedies have been &s;unk into an in&s;ipid Languor by the ineffectual Whim of Epi&s;odic Love? The Tragedy of <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> excepting now and then &s;ome glittering Conceits, which we may &s;uppo&s;e to be Transfu&s;ions from the <HI>Italian Novelli&s;t,</HI> who furni&s;hed <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> with the Story, affords a beau|tiful Repre&s;entation of two young Minds touched with this tender Sympathy. Many of the Tragedies of <HI>Beau|mont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher,</HI> though they are now too much neg|lected, di&s;play the delicate Sen&s;ations of Love, in all their native genuine Simplicity. I am not clear whe|ther the fine Interchange of Sentiments between <HI>Jaffier</HI> and <HI>Belvidera</HI> &s;hould come within the Precincts of Love; becau&s;e the De&s;ire of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which fires the tender Imagination into a gentle Enthu&s;ia&s;m, has then &s;ub|&s;ided into a &s;ympathetic Friend&s;hip between Man and Wife; and accordingly the mo&s;t pathetic Touches are derived, not from the Lover's fond Hope of mutual Bli&s;s to come, but from a Retro&s;pect to tho&s;e vani&s;hed Hours, when <HI>Jaffier</HI> lay for three whole happy Years in his <HI>Belvidera</HI>'s Arms; and thus the Tran&s;ition from their former Endearments to their pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery, ex|cites tho&s;e inten&s;e Emotions of Pity for their Fate. Perhaps, after the Writers ju&s;t mentioned, the Tragedy of <HI>Tancred</HI> and <HI>Sigi&s;munda,</HI> has the faire&s;t Claim to any Degree of Reputation; in this Piece the Love of the young Prince is manly, and never dwindles into childi&s;h Conceit; the Feelings of <HI>Sigi&s;munda</HI> are delicate and &s;en&s;ible, and through all the Scenes the Softne&s;s of their Pa&s;&s;ion is ennobled by Sentiments of Honour and moral Dignity. But, among all the Books, which the ena|moured of both Sexes are apt to call for at this Sea&s;on of the Year, there is none which can exhibit &s;o lively a Picture of Love, as the Fourth Book of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil,</HI> which I would recommend to my young Readers, not by Way of adding Fuel to the Fire, but to warn them
<PB N="209" REF="212">of the Dangers of the growing Flame; as they will here perceive all the Vici&s;&s;itudes of the Pa&s;&s;ion, till at length it terminates in a melancholy Cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Paper with an Extract from an unpubli&s;hed Pamphlet, written by an ingenious Gentle|man, who has given me Leave to make my own u&s;e of it. It is called the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>'s <HI>Pond for the Month of May,</HI> and, though &s;ome of the Incidents are not the Effects of Love, it will, however, &s;hew many of the Di&s;a&s;ters that attend that &s;weet, but dangerous Sen&s;ation.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Ro&s;amond's Pond for the Month of May.</HEAD>

<P><HI>William Ponderwell,</HI> was in Love with a celebrated Coquette, and after paying an Attendance of &s;everal Months, he was at length quite tired out, and walked very demurely to the Brink of the Pond, where he &s;tood for &s;ome Time fixed in Thought, then changed his Mind and walked home very cooly.</P>
<P><HI>Bob Dare Devil,</HI> having very pa&s;&s;ively received a Kicking from an Officer, threw him&s;elf in the oblivious Lake, that he might not &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of his Honour; he was taken up, and now lights your Honour acro&s;s the Way about <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Play-hou&s;e.</P>

It is with the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure I now let you know, that &s;everal Pre|tenders to Poetry have wrote new Tragedies and Co|medies, and in &s;uch a Manner as will afford the highe&s;t Joy, as they will all mo&s;t infallibly be damned, when|ever they appear.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the City,</HI></P>
<P>Your clapping and hi&s;&s;ing, with implicit Deference to my Judgement, at both Play-hou&s;es, during this la&s;t Winter, &s;hews your Affection for me and my Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>My Friends and Critics,</HI></P>
<P>It is with an un&s;peakable Regret I am now to tell you, that Critici&s;m does not agree with my Con&s;titution, and therefore I mu&s;t retire from tho&s;e weighty Cares, until Providence &s;hall plea&s;e to re&s;tore my hi&s;&s;ing Powers, which are now &s;omewhat impaired. On this Account I mu&s;t now di&s;&s;olve the Parliament of Critici&s;m, and, whenever you are &s;ummoned together again, I hope
<PB N="212" REF="215">will adhere to the noble Principles of <HI>Malevoli&s;m,</HI> which it has ever been my Study to inculcate.</P>
<P><HI>And the Parliament of Critict&s;m was di&s;&s;olved accordingly.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Know the Importance of an Author to him|&s;elf is &s;o very great, that he looks upon it as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the Public &s;hould be informed of every particular Cir|cum&s;tance relating to his Body or Mind; as for In|&s;tance, at what Hour he goes to Bed, on which Side he compo&s;ed him&s;elf to Sleep; whether his Slumbers were interrupted, and above all, the Purport of his Dreams, <HI>for Dreams de&s;cend from Jove.</HI> This Practice I believe, is perfectly ju&s;t; but I hope Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI> will not mono|polize Dreaming, and that he will give an occa&s;ional Writer the Liberty of communicating to the Public, how he pa&s;&s;ed the Night. My Hopes of &s;ucceeding in this Reque&s;t are the more &s;anguine, as the intellectual Scene, of which I mean here to give &s;ome Account, was occa&s;ioned by a Peru&s;al of a Vi&s;ion of your own, in which you de&s;cribe a <HI>Sacrifice to the Graces.</HI></P>
<P>The Images, which that Piece excited in my Fancy, incorporated, if I may &s;o call it, with the Ideas, that have been uppermo&s;t in my waking Thoughts for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, and I imagined in my Sleep that there was a general Election in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> for proper Members to re|pre&s;ent
<PB N="213" REF="216">the Republic of Letters. It &s;eems, <HI>Apollo</HI> was induced by frequent Murmurs and Complaints to di&s;|&s;olve his Parliament; &s;ome Malcontents among the Moderns, being of Opinion, that the Antients had ar|bitrarily voted them&s;elves perpetual Dictators in Wit; whereas, upon a free uninfluenced, Election, they be|lieved them&s;elves capable of returning a larger Number than the &s;aid Antients. The Party for the Moderns was led on by Mon&s;ieur <HI>De la Motte, Perrault</HI> and <HI>Wot|ton;</HI> the two former were vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by <HI>Boi|leau,</HI> Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> and the latter by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> and Doctor <HI>Swift. Swift</HI> ordered a new Edition of his Battle of the Books to be publi&s;hed forthwith, and <HI>Pope</HI> took occa&s;ion to reprint his E&s;&s;ays, and Critici&s;ms upon <HI>Homer.</HI> The <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Intere&s;t</HI> were the Words by which each Party &s;ignified their Attachments, and Reams of <HI>Lampoons, Acro&s;tics,</HI> and <HI>Rebu&s;&s;es</HI> were i&s;&s;ued out by the Moderns, which were all an&s;wered by Epi|grams, Fables, and Burle&s;que Pieces written by the Friends of the Antients.</P>
<P>At length the Writs were i&s;&s;ued out to the proper Officers to chu&s;e Repre&s;entatives for the &s;everal Coun|ties and Borough-Towns in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;ome Places, by poetic Licence, having Leave to return as many Mem|bers, as could fairly prove a Qualification. <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were declared for epic Poetry; <HI>Milton</HI> was &s;et up by the Encouragement of &s;everal Friends, and they were all three accordingly cho&s;en. <HI>Homer</HI> had four and twenty upon the Poll, and <HI>Virgil</HI> twelve; <HI>Milton,</HI> by an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment a little before the Election, created two new Votes, by which he al&s;o reached the Number twelve, and <HI>Virgil</HI> was &s;o mode&s;t that he made no Ob|jection to it. <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore,</HI> were declared Candidates, but the former was proved to have bribed with <HI>clinquant,</HI> and the latter could not make out a Qualification.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="217">In the Regions of Tragedy, <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> joined Intere&s;ts, and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> undertook to canva&s;s for them; but <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> carried it by a great Majo|rity; <HI>Corneille</HI> and <HI>Racine</HI> &s;tood next upon the Li&s;t, but a Scrutiny was demanded in Favour of the <HI>Old In|tere&s;t,</HI> upon a Su&s;picion that &s;everal <HI>Copy-holders</HI> had polled for the Moderns, and the <HI>New-Intere&s;t</HI> employed &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Critics to go through their An&s;wer; it was thought it will at la&s;t end in a double Return; and it was further &s;aid, that <HI>Otway</HI> and <HI>Row</HI> would be de|clared duly elected. <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Lee</HI> joined Intere&s;ts, and though many gay and flighty Per&s;ons were very warm in their Cau&s;e, their Schemes were looked upon by the cool and judicious, as rather too wild and ro|mantic. The <HI>French</HI> Critics threatened, that at &s;ome future Election, they &s;hould be able to make more Members, being re&s;olved to put up <HI>Crebillon</HI> and <HI>Vol|taire</HI> even again&s;t <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> to which end, &s;everal Li|bels again&s;t the la&s;t mentioned Genius were already drawn up by <HI>Voltaire.</HI></P>
<P>In the comic Territories the Antients lo&s;t their Elec|tion by a very great Majority; <HI>Moliere, Ben John&s;on, Congreve</HI> and <HI>Vanburgh,</HI> being declared duly elected. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was made an honourary Member for this Quarter, and was univer&s;ally allowed to be a Repre&s;en|tative of both Places. <HI>Dryden</HI> found Means, by the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Friar, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into this Place, and it was given out, that when <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> ar|rives here, he will be put up as a Per&s;on duly qualified, though it is apprehended that his Quarrel with <HI>Pope</HI> has deprived him of &s;everal Votes.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Intere&s;t</HI> exulted greatly upon their Conque&s;t in the la&s;t Election, and in order to compleat their Triumph, proceed further into the Regions of <HI>Humour</HI> and <HI>Ridicule. Homer</HI> was here again put up by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who urged the <HI>Margites</HI> as a &s;ufficient Claim; but the Writings of that E&s;tate being lo&s;t, he was obliged to
<PB N="215" REF="218">decline the Poll. After this, an Adverti&s;ement was pub|li&s;hed, de&s;iring the Votes and Intere&s;t of all the true Sons of Merriment for <HI>Ari&s;tophanes, Menander, Plautus,</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> who had ju&s;t lo&s;t their Election in another Place; <HI>Lucian</HI> &s;et up upon his own Intere&s;t. The <HI>Moderns</HI> declared <HI>Cervantes, Rablais, Swift</HI> and <HI>Butler</HI> joint Candidates, being all Gentlemen heartily attached to true Wit and Humour. Votes were al&s;o &s;ollicited for &s;everal other Per&s;onages; Mon&s;ieur <HI>la Sage, Scarroon, Marivaux,</HI> and <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> were &s;trongly recommended; but the latter being returned in Conjunction with <HI>Te|rence</HI> and <HI>la Sage</HI> for the Borough of POLITE-MIRTH, Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> appeared on the Hu&s;tings, and with|drew his Friend's Name. <HI>Swift</HI> mixed with the lower Sort of People; joked with the Women about their Dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, and republi&s;hed his Account of the &s;trange Man ju&s;t arrived in Town. <HI>Rablais</HI> contributed a good deal to the general Mirth; <HI>Cervantes</HI> occa&s;ion|ally gave vent to a Vein of low Humour, but <HI>Lucian</HI> could not make him&s;elf univer&s;ally under&s;tood, and many of his Turns did not allude to modern-practi&s;ed Life. <HI>Scarroon</HI> got together a Company of Strollers, and exhibited Entertainments in Booths with great Suc|ce&s;s. <HI>Ward, Concanon,</HI> and <HI>Tom Brown</HI> offered them|&s;elves on this Occa&s;ion, but were rejected with Con|tempt. At length the Books were clo&s;ed, and <HI>Lucian Cervantes, Butler,</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> were declared duly elected. At which the Managers for the <HI>New Intere&s;t</HI> were highly in&s;tamed; they lodged a Petition in Favour of <HI>Rablais,</HI> but &s;uch a Vein of Extravagance run through the Whole, and &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages were worked up into &s;uch a Strain of unintelligible Frolic, that it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed it would be given again&s;t him. However, his Friends were determined to bring him in for an inferior Bo|rough, and <HI>Scarron</HI> and <HI>Marivaux</HI> were al&s;o a&s;&s;ured of their Election. Whenever <HI>Fielding</HI> &s;hall arrive to his
<PB N="216" REF="219">E&s;tate in this Part of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> there is a Borough ready to elect him.</P>
<P>To have &s;o many Moderns cho&s;en for the la&s;t Divi|&s;ion was highly agreeable to the <HI>New Intere&s;t;</HI> they were however a good Deal dejected at the Election for <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> for which the Conte&s;t was ineffectual. <HI>Thyci|dides, Sallu&s;t, Livy,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> being cho&s;en by a great Majority. <HI>Faminianus Strada</HI> endeavoured to hurt the Election of the la&s;t mentioned Writer, in order, as it was thought, to &s;ub&s;titute him&s;elf; but <HI>Peers</HI> being al|lowed to appear at Elections in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> Lord <HI>Boling|broke</HI> gave all his Intere&s;t to <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him that his Works were of infinite U&s;e in all his political Tracts. <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> recommended St. <HI>Real,</HI> an approved <HI>French</HI> Hi&s;torian, to a Borough. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was put up without his Con&s;ent, a literary Fame not being the Object of his Ambition; Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> was for a long Time decried by a Party, but was at la&s;t declared duly elected.</P>
<P><HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> harangued from the Hu&s;tings, and were unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en for <HI>Oratory;</HI> and it was thought that &s;ome who have made a con&s;picuous Figure in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliaments, would be admitted to the Ho|nour of a Seat with tho&s;e immortal Geniu&s;&s;es. A Party of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> endeavoured to make a Stand, upon the Strength of &s;ome certain Funeral Orations, but in a few Hours they found them&s;elves greatly out-polled.</P>
<P><HI>Horace, Boileau, Dryden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> were made the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>Satyr; Juvenal</HI> and <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> ha|ving &s;et up for Places upon their own &s;eparate Intere&s;ts; as &s;oon as the Election was over Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> thanked the Con&s;tituents for the Honour conferred upon him, and &s;ignified his Inclination to take his Seat for <HI>Ethics,</HI> to which he was reeommended by the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Bo|lingbroke,</HI> and the Voters came to a Re&s;olution to fill up the Vacancy by putting up the famous Doctor <HI>Young,</HI> though in his Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220">Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> were returned for real and u&s;eful Philo&s;ophy, at which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was violently curaged. He was, however, &s;omewhat comforted to find him&s;elf the fir&s;t on the Poll for <HI>Critici&s;m; Longinus, Quintilian,</HI> and <HI>Bobours</HI> were al&s;o declared duly elected. There was a great Number of Boroughs in this County, mo&s;t of which were rep&s;e&s;ented by <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> the Chief of whom was the <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bos,</HI> Author of the Reflec|tions upon Poe&s;y and Painting. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was al&s;o returned in this Di&s;trict, but being previou&s;ly cho&s;en, he thanked the Voters in general, and told them they would not be at a Lo&s;s for a proper Repre&s;entative for that Place, whenever the Author of the <HI>Polymetis</HI> &s;hould be willing to &s;tand the Poll.</P>
<P>In the Regions of mi&s;cellaneous Poetry <HI>Dryden</HI> had an Offer from almo&s;t every Place; <HI>Spencer</HI> was elected for a Borough, &s;aid to be over-run with Witches and Fairies; in <HI>Pa&s;toral, Ambro&s;e Phillips</HI> exerted his utmo&s;t Intere&s;t; but it was &s;aid that Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> though he did not chu&s;e to be the Repre&s;entative him&s;elf, had re&s;olved to hinder <HI>Philips</HI> from coming in. <HI>Virgil</HI> thanked the Country People for the Offers made to him&s;elf, expatiated on raral Happine&s;s, and &s;aid he &s;hould always be a Lover of <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Rivers;</HI> but begged Leave to recommend in his room <HI>Vaniere,</HI> Writer of the <HI>Praedium Ru&s;ticum,</HI> and the late Mr. <HI>James Thomp&s;on</HI> Author of the Sea|&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Ae&s;op. Phaedrus, la Fontaine</HI> and <HI>Gay,</HI> were cho&s;en for the fabulous Country, where a new Party was &s;pringing up for the Author of the Fables for the <HI>female Sex,</HI> and, al&s;o for the Fables lately addre&s;&s;ed to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> With the&s;e Proceedings the <HI>New In|tre&s;t</HI> had no Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied, though they were highly di&s;appointed in &s;everal Places.

<P>_MY Friend, Mr. <HI>Candid,</HI> de&s;ires that he may di&s;charge his Promi&s;e to give &s;ome fur|ther Animadver&s;ions on the Tragedy of King <HI>Lear;</HI> as he has run into a long E&s;&s;ay, I &s;hall re&s;ign to him the entire Paper of this Day.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what is ingeniou&s;ly urged by the Gentleman, who obliged me with a Letter upon my former Critici&s;m of King <HI>Lear,</HI> I cannot, after a Review of that Tragedy, find any Rea&s;on to retract my A&s;&s;er|tion, that the aged Monarch's Madne&s;s is occa&s;ioned by the Ingratitude of his Daughters. The Folly of a Pa|rents putting him&s;elf in the Power of his Children, mu&s;t incidentally appear in a Play, founded on &s;uch a Story as that of <HI>Lear;</HI> but, had tho&s;e Children not proved ungrateful, I apprehend there is no Rea&s;on to imagine, the King's Mind would have taken the fatal Turn it did. But the be&s;t Way of knowing, with any Degree of Cer|tainty, the &s;ecret Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Effects, which di&s;clo&s;e them&s;elves in &s;undry Appearances in human Life, is
<PB N="220" REF="223">by gaining an In&s;ight into the private Tempers of Men. <HI>Lean</HI> con&s;idered in this Manner, &s;oon di&s;covers to us the latent Seeds, which are likely to kindle into a Blaze, upon the Revolt of his Daughters. The Impre&s;&s;ion which <HI>Cordelia</HI>'s artle&s;s An&s;wer had upon him is de|&s;cribed by him&s;elf.
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;O mo&s;t &s;mall Fault,</HI></L>
<L><HI>How ugly did&s;t thou in</HI> Cordelia <HI>&s;hew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which, like an Engine, wrench'd my Frame of Nature</HI></L>
<L><HI>From the&s;e a Place; drew from my Heart all Love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And added to the Gail&mdash;</HI></L></Q> This plainly evinces where the old Man's Pa&s;&s;ions were mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible, and how &s;trong the Workings of them were likely to be, when he &s;hould find a total Di&s;affec|tion: No wonder if then his Frame of Nature is wrench'd from the fix'd Place, and indeed, his Ten|dency that Way &s;oon di&s;covers it&s;elf, when he breaks out into the&s;e Words.</P>
<Q><HI>I will forget my Nature;&mdash;&s;o</HI> KIND <HI>a Father!</HI>&mdash;</Q>
<P>Were the Lo&s;s of Royalty upperme&s;t in his Thoughts, his Remarks would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly take their Tincture from thence, and he would rather blame him&s;elf as a WEAK <HI>Father,</HI> who had given all to his Children. But the Circum&s;tance of his having given all, is never men|tioned, unle&s;s it is to aggravate the Ill-u&s;age he has met with, and when he &s;ays to him&s;elf, <HI>To take't again per|force,</HI> it is plain, that it is not merely for the &s;ake of re|gaining lo&s;t Grandeur, but to avenge his Wrongs; and he immediately &s;ubjoins, <HI>Mon&s;ter Ingratitude!</HI>&mdash;and a little after, <HI>let me not be mad; not mad, &s;weet Heaven!</HI> &mdash;The hool, indeed, taunts him with the Folly of his having dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his Power, and put the Rod, as he calls it, in his Childrens Hand. The&s;e Ideas are &s;o obvious, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> knew they would &s;trike even the mo&s;t &s;uperficial Mind; but we find it is no Con&s;i|deration
<PB N="221" REF="224">with the Father, who never dwells upon it, though it is &s;ugge&s;ted to him &s;o frequently. On the other Hand, how acute are his Feelings, whenever he recurs to his Daughters want of filial Piety! He that can read the following Lines, without being &s;oftened into Tears, mu&s;t, as Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has &s;aid upon another Occa&s;ion, have either a very good, or a very bad Head.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Oh!</HI> Regan, <HI>&s;he has tied</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sharp-tooth'd</HI> UNKINDNESS <HI>like a</HI> VULTURE <HI>here</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>&mdash;I &s;carce can &s;peak to thee&mdash;thoul't not believe</HI></L>
<L><HI>With how depraved a Quality&mdash;Oh!</HI> Regan!&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>What a Picture of a Mind have we here?&mdash;The Strugglings with his Sorrows, the Breaks of Pa&s;&s;ion, the Attempt to &s;peak, and the in&s;tant Suppre&s;&s;ion of his Powers, are the mo&s;t natural and pathetic Touches. Can the human Imagination, in all her Trea&s;ury of Lan|guage, find Words to expre&s;s at once the dete&s;table Crime of Di&s;obedience to our Parents, and the exqui|&s;ite Feelings of an injured Father, like the following Pa&s;&s;age?</P>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;She has &s;truck me with her Tongue</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mo&s;t Serpent like upon the very Heart!</HI></L></Q>
<P>Who is there, that does not in&s;tantaneou&s;ly find him&s;elf in a Gu&s;h of Tears on reading the&s;e Lines? And more particularly, when, a little afterwards, he comes to the Speech which clo&s;es with,
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;You think I'll weep;&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No, I'll not weep&mdash;tho' I have full Cau&s;e of weeping&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>&mdash;This Heart &s;hall break into a thou&s;and Flaws</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or e'er I'll weep&mdash;O Fool, I &s;hall go mad&mdash;</HI></L></Q> The la&s;t Touch in this Speech, is the fine&s;t clo&s;e of a Climax of Pa&s;&s;ion that can be conceived; and even then the old Monarch feels that his <HI>Wits begin to turn,</HI> for which melancholy Situation, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> all along

<P>I have dwell'd thus long on the Cau&s;e of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Di&s;traction, becau&s;e the Arguments, offered by my in|genious Corre&s;pondent in the E&s;&s;ay of the 19th of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> carry &s;ome Degree of Plau&s;ibility; but from what has been premi&s;ed, together with what I have urged in my former Paper, there cannot, I think, re|main any Doubt about it. Tho&s;e that are not &s;atisfied with this rea&s;oning are referred to the noble&s;t Com|mentary this, or any Poet ever had; I mean Mr. <HI>Gar|rick</HI>'s Performance of <HI>Lear,</HI> in which there is di&s;played &s;o ju&s;t a Knowledge of the human Mind under a State of Madne&s;s, together with &s;uch exqui&s;ite Feelings of the various Shiftings of the Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o finely at the &s;ame Time en&s;eebled with the Debility of Age, that I be|lieve, whenever this admirable Actor cea&s;es to play this Part, the unhappy Monarch will lo&s;e more than <HI>fifty of his Followers at a Clap.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Though our great Poet pays us very amply for all his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Laws of <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> yet, I have frequently wi&s;hed, that the noble Wildne&s;s of his Genius had not rendered him &s;o unbounded in his Fa|bles. Had this Tragedy been planned with more Art, without an underplot to draw off our Affections from the principal Object, it had been a Piece for all the united Efforts of <HI>Greece</HI> to envy. However, the Epi&s;ode, in which the <HI>Ba&s;tard</HI> is acting the &s;ame unnatural Part as <HI>Lear</HI>'s legitimate Daughters, is not entirely detached from the main Subject; the Misfortunes of the good old <HI>Glo&s;ter,</HI> who endeavours to a&s;&s;i&s;t the forlorn King, mu&s;t touch every Brea&s;t, and the Character of <HI>Edgar</HI> mu&s;t appear amiable in every Eye.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of this Tragedy is full of Terror and Com|mi&s;eration, and our great Foet has here given us a Death, which is not often to be found in the Play|hou&s;e
<PB N="223" REF="226">Bill of Mortality, <HI>viz.</HI> the Death of <HI>Lear</HI> with|out the Dagger, or the Bowl. But, perhaps, af|ter all the Heart-piercing Sen&s;ations, which we have before endured through the whole Piece, it would be too much to &s;ee this actually performed on the Stage; from the Actor whom I have already named, I am &s;ure it would; though, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the Experiment made, convinced at the &s;ame Time that the Play, as it is altered, will always be mo&s;t agreeable to an Audience, as the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Re&s;toration, and the virtuous <HI>Edgar</HI>'s Alliance with the amiable <HI>Cordelia,</HI> mu&s;t always call forth tho&s;e gu&s;hing Tears, which are &s;welled and enobled by a virtuous Joy. The Alteration is ju&s;tified by another Rea|&s;on, which is, that <HI>Lear</HI> was really re&s;tored to his Crown, if we may believe <HI>Spencer,</HI> who gives the following re|markable Narrative, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e this Paper, making no Doubt, but it will afford great Entertainment to the Reader who has not before amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the Compari&s;on, to &s;ee <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Story related by &s;o great a Poet as <HI>Spencer,</HI> in his tenth Canto of the <HI>Fairy-Queen.</HI></P>

<P>_WHEN <HI>Turnus,</HI> in the tenth <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is bu&s;ied in Fields of Slaughter and Deva&s;tation, an interpo&s;ing Godde&s;s &s;hadows forth an illu|&s;ive Appearance of the adver&s;e Warrior, arms the Phantom with an air-drawn Javelin, gives an imaginary Shield and Cre&s;t, adds a mimic Voice, and Sounds innocent of Thought, and then makes the un|real Mockery &s;ly before the Ranks, in order to divert the real Combatant, and engage him in a vain Pur&s;uit. The Impo&s;ition takes Effect, and the General is &s;educed from the Field, when the fugitive Illu&s;ion vani&s;hes into Air, and then too late the Hero perceives, that he had
<PB N="226" REF="229">quitted the Field of Glory, and the nece&s;&s;ary Duties of his Calling, to di&s;tingui&s;h his martial Prowe&s;s again&s;t a fictitious Enemy, where no Honour could be reaped. In the Warfare of the Pen, &s;omething like this very commonly happens, and a Writer is no &s;ooner ob&s;erved to be engaged in a right Cour&s;e, but a counterfeit Ge|nius is in&s;tantly &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to him. Mother <HI>Dullne&s;s,</HI> who is always as careful of her Favourites as any Godde&s;s in epic Poetry, is &s;ure to make &s;omething appear in the Shape of a Writer; &s;he arms him with a Goo&s;e-Quill, furni&s;hes Ink and Paper, &s;upplies him with empty Words, and unideal Sounds, without any thinking Faculty. <HI>Dat inania verba, dat &s;ine mente &s;onum.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I have ever looked upon the warlike Hero, in the former In&s;tance, to be in a very ridiculous Situation, and &s;urely the Author, who can quit the Pur&s;uit of nobler Game, to follow an idle Scribler in the Form of a Pamphlet, a Letter to a Friend, an unmu&s;e-like Poem, or a pointle&s;s Epigram, mu&s;t, in the Eyes of the Judi|cious, appear to act unworthily, and very much beneath him&s;elf. On this Account it is, that <HI>Ranger</HI> has hitherto kept him&s;elf clear of all Di&s;putes with his Brethren of the Quill, and has ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ued his Plan, though there have not been wanting Things, <Q>that would be Poets thought,</Q> who have endeavoured to mole&s;t him in his Career.</P>
<P>But deaf to all &s;uch Avocations, I have attended only to the Pro&s;ecution of the De&s;ign this Paper fir&s;t &s;et out with, <HI>viz</HI> to conduce my utmo&s;t to the Entertain|ment and In&s;truction of my Readers. The former of the&s;e Views, I flatter my&s;elf, has in &s;ome Degree &s;uc|ceeded, and with Regard to the latter, I do not pre|tend to have enlightened the Under&s;tandings of all my Cotemporaries, nor to have brought about a general Reformation of Men and Manners. The Truth of it is, I cannot con&s;ider the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal,</HI> as a general
<PB N="227" REF="230"><HI>Panacea</HI> for the Defects of Mankind, though my Book|&s;eller and many of my other Friends <HI>(i. e.</HI> Enemies) have been plea&s;ed to compliment me on that Score. When I declare thus much, I beg, I may not be &s;up|po&s;ed to envy the Fame of a very elegant and ingenious Brother-Writer, who very plea&s;antly congratulates him|&s;elf on the exten&s;ive Amendment of Mankind &s;ince the Commencement of his Paper, and a&s;&s;ures us, that there is no &s;uch Thing at pre&s;ent as Cards at <HI>White</HI>'s, or naked Shoulders at <HI>Ranelagh;</HI> and from the general Ce&s;&s;ation of Vice, conceives the <HI>Millennium</HI> to be at Hand; at which happy Period he is determined to lay down his Pen.</P>
<P>For my Part, I &s;hall not wait for the <HI>Milennium;</HI> for I mu&s;t own, I have met with very different Succe&s;s in my Di&s;trict, and therefore I am re&s;olved not to cry out, in Imi|tation of <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> to the vanqui&s;hed <HI>Hot&s;pur,</HI> <Q>there lies Vice; an the King will reward me;&mdash;&s;o;&mdash;if not,&mdash;let him write the next Paper him&s;elf.</Q> So far from having any Title to this Boa&s;t, I have at pre&s;ent only one Letter by me, te&s;tifying the &s;urprizing Cure wrought by my Lu|cubrations, which is as follows.</P>

<P>_THE Languages of all Nations have ever been in a State of Fluctuation, and we find this Complaint is con&s;tantly made by the &s;en&s;ible and judicious in every Age. Tho' the Diction of the <HI>Romans</HI> is likely to endure as long as Time &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t; yet we find that <HI>Horace,</HI> in the Words of my Motto, is aware of the Decay of Words and Phra&s;es, which die away, and are con&s;tantly &s;uc|ceeded by a &s;udden Birth of new Terms and Modes of Phra&s;eology. In &s;everal other Pa&s;&s;ages of his Writings, there are &s;hort Reflections upon this literary Phaeno|menon, in which he always delivers him&s;elf with Sor|row and Regret. They fall, &s;ays he, like Leaves, and are replaced by a new Product; like young Per&s;ons, they flouri&s;h for a &s;hort Time, and then tend to Obli|vion. The Compari&s;on is mo&s;t certainly very ju&s;t; and as young Men in their Bloom and Vigour are &s;aid to be <HI>upon Town,</HI> it is the &s;ame with Words; they are al&s;o
<PB N="232" REF="235"><HI>upon Town</HI> for a Time, and then totally peri&s;h. I have often thought, that a <HI>weekly Bill</HI> of Words would not be unentertaining to Men of Letters, and if there was a proper Regi&s;ter Office for the Purpo&s;e, where their &s;e|veral Births and Burials might be recorded with Ac|curacy and Preci&s;ion, I &s;hould imagine it would furni&s;h no di&s;agreeable Hi&s;tory. A Di&s;tinction might be made between a Kind of Sex in Words, according as they are appropriated to Men or Women; as for In&s;tance, <HI>D&mdash;n my Blood</HI> is of male Extraction, and <HI>P&s;haw, Fiddle&s;tick,</HI> I take to be female.

<Q><HI>A</HI> Specimen <HI>of an</HI> Engli&s;h Dictionary.</Q>
<P>CREATURE, A Term to &s;hew our Contempt of any Per&s;on whom we di&s;like, chiefly u&s;ed by the Ladies.</P>
<P>THING, Very often u&s;ed to imply our Di&s;like, but chiefly u&s;ed to &s;ignify our highe&s;t Approbation. Thus it is &s;aid of a fine Lady; "She's the very Thing," or of a young Fellow, "O, Ma'em, he's the very Thing;" and &s;ometimes with Limitation, as, <Q>yes, very well, but not the Thing.</Q></P>
<P>PATRIOT, A Man who &s;peaks again&s;t the Court till he gets a Place or Pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>HONEST, This Term is derived from the <HI>Latin</HI> Word <HI>Hone&s;tum,</HI> which among the <HI>Romans</HI> implied every
<PB N="234" REF="237">Thing that is honourable in a Character. From thence <HI>Pope</HI> was induced to &s;ay,
<Q><HI>An hone&s;t Man's the noble&s;t Work of God.</HI></Q> This is the original Meaning of the Word; in its con|&s;equential Sen&s;e it is &s;trangely altered. <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> now &s;ig|nifies Gaming, Drinking, and Debauchery of every Sort; it being common to &s;ay of a Man who is ad|dicted to all the&s;e fa&s;hionable Vices, that he's an <Q><HI>Ho|ne&s;t Fellow.</HI></Q></P>
<P>GOOD-NATURE, an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word u&s;ed by our Ance&s;tors; it is plain, that it carried with it &s;ome Allu|&s;ion to the Cu&s;toms and Manners of tho&s;e Times, but there is no tracing it to its Source.</P>
<P>RELIGION, an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word for the Wor&s;hip of a Supreme Being, and the Practice of &s;ocial Duties to our Neighbours; probably a Cu&s;tom known to the an|tient Druids.</P>
<P>HUMBUG, A Lye.</P>
<P>WORTH, originally it meant laudable Qualities of the Mind; at pre&s;ent tis &s;olely confined to a Man's For|tune: Thus a Scoundrel of fifty Thou&s;and is a Man of <HI>Worth,</HI> and an hone&s;t Man in Indigence is <HI>worth</HI> no|thing.</P>
<P>PARTY, &s;ormerly &s;ignified Divi&s;ions in the State, at pre&s;ent it means a Jaunt to <HI>Vaux-hall, Bedlam, Church,</HI> or any Place of Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>TRAGEDY, a Name by which <HI>Shake&s;pear, Otway,</HI> and &s;ome others entitled their dramatic Writings; the Mo|derns retain the Word, but have totally lo&s;t the original Sen&s;e of it.</P>
<P>COMEDY, probably a Piece in which our rude An|ce&s;tors repre&s;ented the Follies and Characters of the Age; nothing of this Sort is at pre&s;ent known among&s;t us.</P>
<P>DAMNED, when Prie&s;tcraft prevailed in this Country, the People were frightened with &s;trange Ideas of <HI>Hell,</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="238">or a Place of Torture, where the departed Spirits of bad Men were &s;uppo&s;ed to be confined. At pre&s;ent it &s;ignifies the highe&s;t Prai&s;e we can confer. Thus we &s;ay, <Q>A damned fine Woman; a damned charming Crea|ture; a damned fine Fellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>DRUM, an In&s;trument of warlike Mu&s;ic u&s;ed at the March of an Army, or in Time of Battle to animate the Soldiery: Hence &s;tiled by <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> the <HI>Spirit &s;tirring Drum.</HI> It has not been u&s;ed to any Purpo&s;e by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ince the Days of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> In its metaphorical Sen&s;e it means a Party of Cards, <HI>(Vide Rout.)</HI></P>
<P>FRIENDSHIP, an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word u&s;ed by our An|ce&s;tors to &s;ignify the complex Idea of Affection and E&s;teem between two or more Per&s;ons, founded upon a virtuous Sympathy of Tempers, and congenial Habits of Virtue (<HI>for the Meaning of the Word</HI> VIRTUE, <HI>&s;ee in its re&s;pective Place:)</HI> This Cu&s;tom was totally bani&s;hed in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and few or no Traces of it have been di&s;covered ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>GOD, The antient <HI>Druids,</HI> it is probable from all Hi|&s;torians imagined that a &s;uperior Being &s;uper-intended the Direction of the Univer&s;e, and the Term GOD, it is not unlikely, originally fignified this &s;uperior Being; but &s;ince it has been happily found out, that every Thing was made by <HI>Chance,</HI> or that <HI>Nature, (Vide</HI> Na|ture <HI>in its proper Place)</HI> produced every Thing we be|hold, and &s;ince the Properties of Matter have been &s;ufficiently detected by Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and others, the Term <HI>God</HI> is totally exploded, as merely expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome Chimaera, which has no Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>MODESTY, alludes to &s;ome Cu&s;tom among the an|tient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies.</P>
<P>EARTHQUAKE, a Party at Cards. (Vide <HI>Rout, Drum,</HI> or <HI>Hurricane.</HI>)</P>
<P>FASHION, a polite Term of Excu&s;e for all the Vices that can be thought of.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="239">NATURE, Nothing at all; it is often called <HI>Pla&s;tic Nature, univer&s;al Nature,</HI> &amp;c. but the Idea is always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>ROUT, formerly &s;ignified the Defeat of an Army, and when the Soldiers were all put to flight or to the Sword, they were &s;aid to be routed. The Ladies, in order to pre&s;erve &s;ome Idea of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i, Poitiers, Blenheim,</HI> &amp;c. have agreed to call their A&s;&s;emblies by the Name of <HI>Routs.</HI> This, it is thought, they do with more Propriety, as frequently at the&s;e Meetings whole Families are en|tirely <HI>routed</HI> out of Hou&s;e and Home.</P>
<P>SOUI. It was formerly believed, that in each human Creature there exi&s;ted &s;omething incorruptible, which was not to peri&s;h with the Di&s;&s;olution of our Bodies, but to be removed to &s;ome other Part of the Univer&s;e, and there to enjoy the Reward due to Virtue, or &s;uffer condign Puni&s;hment for all Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, while in this State of Probation. But the happy Di&s;covery of the Properties of Matter has al&s;o bani&s;hed this ab&s;urd Doc|trine, which &s;erves now to embelli&s;h the Fictions of Poets.</P>
<P>IMMENSE, an Epithet of Prai&s;e, thus we &s;ay <Q>an immen&s;e fine Woman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (vide <HI>Damned.</HI></Q>)</P>
<P>VIRTUE, The antient <HI>Druids</HI> made it a Rule to keep all their Pa&s;&s;ions in due Government, by which Mean, they were never known to prejudice their Neigh|bours, or hurt their own Con&s;titutions by Intemperance; and this Practice, it is probable, was &s;ignified by the Word <HI>Virtue.</HI> It is u&s;ed by <HI>Shake&s;pear, Spencer, Milton, Pope,</HI> and other Poets, as a pretty Ornament for their romantic Performances. (Vide <HI>Friend&s;hip.)</HI></P>
<P>PITY, This is al&s;o an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word, the Mean|ing of which cannot be traced; it is now a Word of Cour&s;e, when we do not care a Farthing for a Friend in Affliction.</P>

<P>_OUR Club met a few Nights &s;ince at the <HI>Devil</HI> Tavern, when the Conver&s;ation principally turned upon Topics of Litera|ture, and particularly dramatic Poetry. Many of our be&s;t modern Tragedies were examined, and I ob&s;erved it was frequently &s;aid of Pieces con|fe&s;&s;edly inartificial in the Fable, unforcible in Senti|ment, and de&s;titute of Character, that they contained a very fine Vein of Poetry. Our Profe&s;&s;or of Critici&s;m immediately objected to the Propriety of the Expre&s;&s;ion. He did not under&s;tand how a bad Play could have fine Poetry, and he has formed a Plan for a Set of Papers, which may throw &s;ome Light on this Matter. I &s;hall this Day pre&s;ent my Readers with one, which I think may &s;erve as an Opening to the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>In order to decide upon the Excellence or Imper|fection of any Art, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know the original Intent and Aim of that Art, and al&s;o the &s;everal Means by which it accompli&s;hes its De&s;igns. The bet|ter to inve&s;tigate this, with regard to any Branch of Li|terature, it will be expedient to trace all Manner of Compo&s;ition to its Source, and thence to pur&s;ue the &s;e|veral Rivulets which have &s;treamed from it. This has been done with great Per&s;picuity and Elegance by the Author of the E&s;&s;ays on the Characteri&s;tics, who has very ju&s;tly determined the three primary Branches of Compo&s;ition to be, <HI>Poetry, Eloquence,</HI> and <HI>Argument.</HI> He adds, that a ju&s;t Coalition of the three forms the con|&s;ummate Beauty of fine Writing, and then, continues
<PB N="239" REF="242">he, <Q>it would be perhaps both a new and plea&s;ing Speculation to point out the Writers in their &s;everal Kinds, who have been mo&s;t remarkably excellent, or defective with Regard to the ju&s;t Union of the&s;e three Species of Cempo&s;ition. At pre&s;ent it mu&s;t &s;uffice to have hinted &s;uch a Critici&s;m, which the Reader may ea&s;ily pro&s;ecute.</Q> Such a Critici&s;m might di&s;tingui&s;h the re&s;pective Graces of all Kinds of Writing, and furni&s;h the Criterions by which to judge of the proper Beauties of each different Species. I &s;hall now beg Leave to offer a few cur&s;ory Reflections on this Subject; and, in order to proceed with the greater Per&s;picuity, &s;hall attempt a &s;hort Account of the Ri&s;e of the three Modes of Writing already mentioned.</P>
<P>Man being a &s;ociable Creature, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that certain Signs, univer&s;ally agreed upon, &s;hould be u&s;ed for the reciprocal Conveyance of his Ideas. Sounds, which we call Words, were the quicke&s;t Vehicles, and therefore grew into general U&s;e. According as our Stock of Ideas enIarged it&s;elf, the Demand for Words became more exten&s;ive, and as Societies were framed, and People a&s;&s;embled by civil Policy, Intercour&s;e begot further Acqui&s;itions, and thus, Language was daily en|larged. But it being impo&s;&s;ible that every di&s;tinct Idea &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed by a Term appropriated to it, the Mind naturally had Recour&s;e to the Faculty of Rea&s;on, which compares, di&s;tingui&s;hes, and &s;eparates the Ideas which have pa&s;&s;ed through the Sen&s;es, or have been formed into different Combinations by the Power of Imagination. By the&s;e Means, a Similitude was di&s;|covered between &s;undry various Images, and thence it followed, that Things were expre&s;&s;ed by borrowed Names, on account of a Re&s;emblance exi&s;ting between them. The Term thus transferred was called a <HI>Meta|phor,</HI> and, as it happens in the commercial Intercour&s;e of Mankind, what was at firi&s;t introduced out of Nece&s;|&s;ity, became, in Proce&s;s of Time, an ab&s;olute Luxury.
<PB N="240" REF="243">This the Poets &s;oon perceived; and as it was their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to lead uncultivated Multitudes from their Huts and Dens, by &s;eizing their Imaginations with their Songs and Ballads, the Metaphor &s;oon appeared to them to be an effectual Means of painting Things in warmer Colours to the Fancy, which is ever greatly de|lighted when any new and unfore&s;een A&s;&s;emblage is offered to its View. The Epithet which denotes the Qualities inherent in all Objects, lent its auxiliary Aid, and Poetry, with the&s;e adventitious Ornaments became the Delight of Mankind.</P>
<P>But the Matter did not re&s;t here; as Cities were mul|tiplied, and as States enlarged them&s;elves, artificial Pa&s;&s;ions began to operate; Ambition then began to gra&s;p at Power and Pre-eminence, and <HI>Envy, Jealou&s;y, Revenge</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> &s;owed the Seeds of Di&s;cord, and mutual Di&s;tru&s;t; and thus while they were di&s;tracted with inte&s;tine Commotions, the adjacent States, de&s;irous of extending their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, made Inroads upon them. In the&s;e Emergencies there was not Time for the mea|&s;ured Writer to produce his poetic Compo&s;ition; an immediate Addre&s;s was requi&s;ite to influence the Pa&s;|&s;ions of the Multitude, and therefore Men of Genius came forth, and de&s;titute of Number, addre&s;&s;ed the People in humble Pro&s;e. But here, &s;till the Attention was to be fixed, and therefore they could not dive&s;t them&s;elves of all the Properties of Poetry, but continued to addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Imagination of their Au|ditors, and thus to influence their Pa&s;&s;ions and per&s;wade them to their own Good. As the lea&s;t Appearance of a De&s;ign upon their Under&s;tandings on the&s;e Occa&s;ions would totally defeat it&s;elf, it thence re&s;ulted, that all tho&s;e ambitious Ornaments, and all tho&s;e gaudy Colour|ings, which Poetry &s;preads &s;o lavi&s;hly on every Subject, were here introduced with a more &s;paring Hand, and the Imagination was only addre&s;&s;ed as it affords various Acce&s;&s;es to the Pa&s;&s;ions. In this Manner Eloquence
<PB N="241" REF="244">deduced its being; and was only a le&s;s luxuriant Kind of Poetry, which endeavoured to practi&s;e the Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion, and to win over the Pa&s;&s;ions of the People to its own End and U&s;e.</P>
<P>In Proportion as Mankind became enlightened, as Arts and Manufactures encrea&s;ed, and as Science ex|tended it&s;elf, it was not enough that <HI>Poetry</HI> charmed with its graceful Combinations, and that <HI>Eloquence</HI> awakened and agitated the Pa&s;&s;ions; <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> began then to exert its Influence, to look for Utility and Truth in every Compo&s;ition, and &s;tripping away the Luxuriances of lavi&s;h De&s;cription, it began cooly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to con&s;ider every Thing that was offered. Hence &s;prung the <HI>Didactic,</HI> or the Argumentative; <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> was obliged to proceed by fair Deductions, and as much as po&s;&s;ible to conceal his Art from a People, who were &s;o poli&s;hed, that they would have de&s;pi&s;ed tho&s;e Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion, which <HI>Tully</HI> practi&s;ed with Succe&s;s upon Minds le&s;s artful and le&s;s informed than the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>In this Manner, it appears to me, the&s;e three pri|mary Branches of Compo&s;ition aro&s;e in the World, each being plainly deducible from the very Principles of our Con&s;titution. For as the Imagination is the warme&s;t Faculty of the Soul, <HI>Poetry,</HI> who&s;e principal Intent is to plea&s;e, is particularly addre&s;&s;ed to this Power of Perception. <HI>Eloquence,</HI> though more cha&s;te and re&s;erved in its Embelli&s;hments, &s;trikes chiefly at the Pa&s;&s;ions, and as they are then mo&s;t powerfully excited, when Fancy pictures &s;trong Appearances of Good or Evil. <HI>Eloquence</HI> is obliged to have Recour&s;e to the Regions of Imagination, in order to render its Co|lourings &s;tronger and more glowing; and further, as the Province of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is to compare its Ideas, and to form various Affirmations or Negations relative to them, the <HI>Didactic</HI> is principally confined to this Province. There are not in human Nature any other Inlets of Per|ception, or any other Faculties of Sen&s;ation to which
<PB N="242" REF="245">the Art of a Writer could apply, and therefore the Imagination, the Pa&s;&s;ions, and Rea&s;on are ju&s;tly the three Springs of Compo&s;ition. But Men of Refine|ment and Reflection, perceiving what a powerful Influ|ence any one of the&s;e Branches of Writing has upon the Mind, have thence inferred, that the joint Force of all three united, mu&s;t carry the Power of Genius to &s;till a greater Degree of Perfection, and, therefore, in whatever Way they were engaged, they have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to make Excur&s;ions into their Neighbours Territories, and borrow thence &s;everal Improvements to heighten their Productions. As for In&s;tance, in like Manner, as <HI>Eloquence</HI> has learned from <HI>Poetry</HI> to warm and enliven the Imagination, <HI>Poetry</HI> has marked the Influence of <HI>Eloquence</HI> on the Pa&s;&s;ions, and has en|deavoured to glide to the Heart through the &s;ame In|lets; and both have al&s;o found it nece&s;&s;ary to recom|mend them&s;elves to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and have occa&s;ionally &s;trengthened them&s;elves with In&s;ertions of the <HI>Didactic.</HI> The rea&s;oning Faculty has, in its Turn, perceived, that a mere Train of Deductions would be too dry, and therefore it takes Occa&s;ion to adorn it&s;elf with the Flowers of Imagination, and, in &s;ome Speculations, it even endeavours to awaken the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Hence then it appears, that a Concurrence of the primary Branches of Writing is requi&s;ite in all Works of Genius; but, as there is &s;ome Danger of running Riot, and making too frequent and unju&s;tifiable Pro|gre&s;&s;es into each others Territories, it was nece&s;&s;ary to fix the Boundaries of each Kind, and to determine how far any one of them may indulge it&s;elf in its Approaches towards the others, in order to pre&s;erve the e&s;&s;ential Dif|ference in every Compo&s;ition, to ob&s;erve the proper Qualities, and the ju&s;t Colourings of each; or as <HI>Horace</HI> has it,
<Q><HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">nctas &s;ervare vices operumque colores.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="246">There are in Nature but few original Colours, and it is from the Meltings and Softenings of the&s;e into each other, that all other Appearances to the Eye derive their Origin. It is the fame in Writing; the &s;everal Species of it, which are now practi&s;ed, are Modes of <HI>Poetry, Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> differently blended. How far the Union is ju&s;t, &s;hall be occa&s;ionally exa|mined in a few detached E&s;&s;ays; and by the&s;e Means we &s;hall &s;ee the peculiar Merit of an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> a <HI>Tra|gedy,</HI> a <HI>Comedy,</HI> &amp;c. and the Reader may at his Lei&s;ure carry the Re&s;earch into &s;everal &s;ubordinate Branches of Writing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>To</HI> CHARLES RANGER, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU have long &s;ince li&s;ted your&s;elf in the Service of the Fair; as a Volunteer in the &s;ame Cau&s;e, I now take the Liberty to addre&s;s this Letter to you, which will, be|fore I have done, &s;ufficiently unfold me and my Call|ing. I am induced to it, by an Adverti&s;ement in the common News Papers, calculated merely for the U&s;e of the rougher Sex, without any Regard to the weak, but lovely, Part of the Creation, who &s;tand mo&s;t in need of adventitious Aids, to guide them in an Age of Vice and Folly. The Adverti&s;ement I mean is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen that are inclined for Marriage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have daily fre&s;h deplorable Rea&s;ons to pre&s;s you to fly to me to prepare for that important Statc; if my Advice
<PB N="245" REF="248">only is wanting, you &s;hall have it, without any View of Return, and, let what will be wanting, be a&s;&s;ured the Emclument or Plea&s;ure I &s;hall have from the In&s;titu|tion, will chiefly con&s;i&s;t in that &s;weete&s;t of Sen&s;ations, which the Heart feels in having relieved the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or in|&s;pirited the Languid. I have by hard Study found out Medicines that will give perfect Redre&s;s to any afflicted with the venereal Infection, or Weakne&s;s of Body, from any Injuries, in a &s;hort Time&mdash;from Mr.</HI> J. O. <HI>Ho&s;pital Surgeon, oppo&s;ite the</HI> Auditor's-Office, <HI>in</HI> Upper Scotland-Yard, <HI>near</HI> White-Hall. <HI>N. B. The &s;tricte&s;t Honour may be depended on.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Would not one imagine, upon Peru&s;al of the fir&s;t Part of this Adverti&s;ement, that it is the Effu&s;ion of Benevo|lence in &s;ome Clergyman, prompted by a laudable Zeal to encourage the Ob&s;ervance of the Commandment for the Propagation of the Species, and add his Efforts to &s;trengthen the late Marriage Act. <HI>To prepare for that important State.</HI>&mdash;Does not this Expre&s;&s;ion &s;ugge&s;t Ideas of our awful Religion, and the &s;olemn In&s;titution e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by it?&mdash;And then how di&s;intere&s;ted is the &s;weete&s;t of his Sen&s;ations!&mdash;It does not lie in the Palm of his Hand, but plays around his generous Heart, and is an Indication of a pure and exten&s;ive Charity. On read|ing a little further, it however appears, that Mr. <HI>J. O.</HI> has only a&s;&s;umed the Appearance of a Par&s;on, like Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> in the Play, for a Frolick, and, when you are ju&s;t upon the Point of enquiring if he has any Cure, he cries out very frankly, <HI>"an excellent Cure for a Clap,"</HI> As Surgery is now arrived to a very great Degree of Per|fection, I do not doubt but the la&s;t A&s;&s;ertion may be very true; but as to his Preparations for the important State of Matrimony, we are quite le&s;t in the Dark. But be it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Men to make farther Enquiries about this his boa&s;ted <HI>No&s;trum.</HI> As I do not propo&s;e to con|cern my&s;elf, in the Cour&s;e of my Practice, with the Lords of the Creation, being devoted entirely to the Service of
<PB N="246" REF="249">the Ladies. I &s;hall now proceed to offer my own Adver|ti&s;ement, which, I hope, will be attended with very good Con&s;equence.</P>
<Q><P><HI>To the Ladies inclined to Matrimony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Never were ner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Decays le&s;s frequent than at pre|&s;ent, which has induced me to pre&s;s you to enter into the married Life, as you will not, in the pre&s;ent Glow of Health, be in any Danger of converting your Bed-Cham|ber to Nur&s;eries for your Hu&s;bands, nor have any Oc|ca&s;ion to lie with your Footmen. To prepare you for the important State, I have, with infinite Pains, devi&s;ed a</HI> Recipe, <HI>which cannot fail to procure you good Offers very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and to make the married State compleatly happy.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>I have the Honour of having Mr.</HI> Keith, <HI>late of</HI> May-Fair, <HI>to vouch for my being regularly bred at the</HI> Hand and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, <HI>and always a zealous Promoter of Mar|riage before the late Act. From</HI> Q. D. G. <HI>near</HI> May|hair-Chappel.</P></Q>
<P>I know the World in general is apt to form very di&s;|advantageous Ideas of us adverti&s;ing Doctors; but I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have to a&s;&s;ure Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> that the above is not in the ordinary Way of puffing, but to promote the real benefit of the Community. I have obtained a Patent for the &s;ole vending my Compo&s;ition for the Space of Fourteen Years; and, to convince you of its Efficacy, I will hereby inform the World of the Ingredients, which are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o few, that I am not apprehen&s;ive of having my Bu&s;ine&s;s taken out of my Hands. The component Parts of tho&s;e admirable Powders, with which Heaven has enabled Doctor <HI>James</HI> to pre&s;erve, as it were by Proxy, the Lives and Con&s;titutions of Mil|lions, are all very well known; but it is in the Propor|tion of the Mixture, and the whole Proce&s;s of the Pre|paration, that the Secret lies. In like Manner my Me|dicine will &s;ave me the Trouble of crying out, <Q><HI>Beware of Counterfeits, for &s;uch are abroad.</HI></Q> As it will be im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="247" REF="250">to offer any Mixture to the Public, that will not immediately be liable to Detection, the Ingredients are as follow: <Q><HI>Good-Manners, Good-Humour, an Ab&s;tinence from Politicks, an Aver&s;ion from Cards, mo|de&s;tly to keep the Neck and Shoulders covered, Di&s;like of Scandal, Pride, Levity, Folly, Humility, Di&s;cretion, Scorn of Fools, Re&s;erve, Di&s;&s;imulation, Vanity, Frank|ne&s;s, Truth, Neatne&s;s, Honour, Sobriety and Mirth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Among the&s;e it appears there are &s;ome Poi&s;ons; but the&s;e, properly tempered, and counterballanced by op|po&s;ite Qualities, will, I venture to pronounce it, get a young Lady a Hu&s;band, and en&s;ure mutual Happine&s;s, better than any Thing hitherto devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of producing a large Number of Vouchers for the &s;alutary Effects already felt from my Medicine, I &s;hall clo&s;e my Letter with the Hi&s;tory of two female Reigns; for every Beauty is, for a Time, the Queen of her Admirers. The fir&s;t is that of a beautiful Tyrant, who made a wrong U&s;e of her Power; the &s;econd, of a more di&s;creet Sovereign, who had recour&s;e to the above Recipe.</P>
<P><HI>MARIA</HI> a&s;cended the Throne of Beauty in the eigh|teenth Year of her Age; immediately upon her Acce&s;|&s;ion, &s;he di&s;&s;olved her Parliament, turned out of her Privy-Council every Per&s;on of Sen&s;e and Di&s;cretion, and introduced, in their Room, a <HI>French</HI> Hair-Cutter, two Milliners, a Chambermaid, and many other Per&s;onages of equal Rank and Condition. By the Advice of the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;he reigned with de&s;potic Sway. She heard the Complaints of her Slaves without ever feeling the lea&s;t Propen&s;ity to a Redre&s;s of their Grievances, which occa&s;ioned violent Heart-burnings, and at Length called forth a Shoal of Writers again&s;t her Government, as generally happens in all political States, when the &s;upreme Power is abu&s;ed. A Num|ber of Sonnetteers, Libellers, and Epigrammati&s;ts, who
<PB N="248" REF="251">daily poured forth Trea&s;on again&s;t her Beauty, and pro|nounced her born to en&s;lave Mankind. She had a very particular Plea&s;ure in &s;igning metaphorical Death. War|rants for her Votaries; and &s;he looked upon the whole Race of Mankind formed to flatter her Vanity, and to pay her Adoration. She exacted Tributes of Admi|ration at &s;uch an exorbitant Rate, that at la&s;t an <HI>Hamb|den</HI> aro&s;e, who di&s;puted with her a Contribution of In|cences which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon. This Proceeding open|ed the Eyes of the re&s;t of her Subjects, who all con|&s;pired to dethrone her in the twenty-third Year of her Age; and then fell the Tyrant <HI>Maria,</HI> without one to lament her Fall, after a &s;hort Reign of five Years, in which &s;he conquered with &s;o wild a Rage, as the Poet has it, that, with the univer&s;al Joy, &s;ucceeded to her, the fair <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who&s;e Reign commenced, like a mild Evening after the violent Scorching of a hot Summer's Day.</P>
<P><HI>ELIZABETH</HI> endeavoured to render her&s;elf the Mi&s;tre&s;s of all willing Hearts, and valued her&s;elf more upon the Love of her Subjects, than any idle Flattery &s;he might extort from them. The Poet's De&s;cription was perfectly adapted to her;
<Q><L><HI>Favours to none, to all &s;he Smiles extends;</HI></L>
<L><HI>O&s;t &s;he rejects, but never once offends.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>She had no She-Friends in her Cabinet-Council, but guided her&s;elf entirely by the Directions of Prudence, Virtue, and good Sen&s;e. An <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> at length, in&s;inu|ated him&s;elf more particularly into her good Graces; but &s;he had &s;uch a Command over her Pa&s;&s;ions, that &s;he never di&s;graced him by a Blow, but, in the End, took him as an A&s;&s;ociate into her Empire, which &s;he, in a &s;hort Time, finally re&s;igned, in order to enjoy the calmer Gratifications of a dome&s;tic Life, where &s;he now &s;hines with every amiable Grace, while <HI>Toa&s;ts</HI> and other
<PB N="249" REF="252">ambitious Beauties fatigue their Eyes, and weary every Feature, in vain, to gain them Admirers.</P>

<P>By Advices from &s;undry Parts of the Country we learn, that Blood and Blank-Ver&s;e have had a &s;urpri&s;ing Effect upon the Minds of the Country People, during the Summer-Expedition of the Actors; particularly from a Country-Town, on the Borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> we are in|formed of the following remarkable Incident: A Gen|tleman, arriving at an Inn, after a long Day's Journey, with a Hare, which was given him as a Pre&s;ent on his Way, and with which he intended to regale at Night, ordered it to be roa&s;ted for his Supper; but the Landlord told him, it could not be.

<P>_THE Author of my Motto was one of the be&s;t Crities the World has ever produced, and he has, in the above Lines, compri&s;ed the three principal Qualities of Poetry. Its Aim, &s;ays he, is to afford at once Utility and De|light, to offer what may be agreeable to the Fancy, and al&s;o what may conduce to the Advantages of hu|man Life. He further adds, it is not enough for a Poem to abound in Prettyne&s;&s;es, it mu&s;t al&s;o have a &s;weet Acce&s;s to the Heart, and &s;hould be able to agitate the Soul with what Pa&s;&s;ions it plea&s;es. This De&s;cription involves all the leading Requi&s;ites of Poetry; and, it is
<PB N="251" REF="254">remarkable, includes the three primary Branches of Compo&s;ition, exhibited in a former Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> the Art of addre&s;&s;ing our <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> in order to be u&s;eful, the Imagination, to be agreeable, and the Pa&s;&s;ions, in order to per&s;uade and gain upon our Affections. Here then we have <HI>Poe&s;y, Eloquence,</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> united, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, that Performance will be found the mo&s;t excellent in its Kind, which is the mo&s;t highly fini&s;hed with Regard to the&s;e three E&s;&s;entials.</P>
<P><HI>Epic</HI> Poetry has always had the Pre-eminence, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Rea&s;on of this Determination, is, be|cau&s;e it affords the free&s;t and mo&s;t ample Room for a Di&s;play of the three primary and original Species of Writing, It is by ob&s;erving how the&s;e friendly Colours mix and blend with each other, that we are to deduce a Judgment upon the different Authors, who have proved any Way eminent in the literary World, refer|ing to the fir&s;t Principles, being the only Criterion in every Art. <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> and other Critics have informed us, that the epic Fable mu&s;t involve one entire Action; that this Action mu&s;t have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End; They have told us, that the Poet mu&s;t not take up the Thread of his Narrative too near the Clue; but that he mu&s;t ha&s;ten into the Mid&s;t of Things, and oc|ca&s;ionally give a Retro&s;pect to &s;uch Things as are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be known. They have treated largely of the Machinery, of the Time the Fable &s;hould include, with many other Particulars, which though proper to be explained, do not any Way conduce to the Refine|ment of Ta&s;te, or the Improvement of true Genius. It is mo&s;t certain; by ob&s;erving from what Principles in the human Frame each Art is deducible, that any real or valuable Critici&s;m can be formed.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t then, that the Epic Writer has free Latitude of in&s;erting all the Graces of every Kind of Compo&s;ition. All Nature lies at his Command; where|ever
<PB N="252" REF="255">he ca&s;ts his Eyes, he is Lord of the Manor; he can turn a Road, by poetical Act of Parliament, through Lawns and Groves, and Scenes of Pa&s;turage; the four Sea&s;ons obey his Directions, and he need never be at a Lo&s;s for agreeable Exhibitions of Nature, to plea&s;e the Imagination. The whole Sy&s;tem of Ethics is al&s;o his; he may frequently take occa&s;ion to improve his Read|ers by &s;hort Sentences, and tran&s;ient Reflections on hu|man Life, and by the&s;e Means he may gain upon our Rea&s;on to approve his Performances. The whole Art of Eloquence is likewi&s;e perfectly open to the Epic Au|thor, and from thence he may derive an irre&s;i&s;tible Power over our Pa&s;&s;ions. In this la&s;t mentioned Requi|&s;ite the <HI>Abb&eacute; du Bos</HI> places the con&s;ummate Per&s;ection of fine Poetry. Certain it is, the Mind of Man never feels &s;uch inten&s;e Plea&s;ure from any of the imitative Arts, as when its Pa&s;&s;ions are awakened, and it finds it&s;elf rou&s;ed from an impa&s;&s;ive State, and unexpectedly agitated by the &s;kilful Touches of a Ma&s;ter-poet. The Author ju&s;t quoted a&s;cribes this ideal Appearance to the Satisfaction which the Soul enjoys at the Perception of its own Acti|vity: May we not add to this, what is &s;ugge&s;ted, if I re|member right, by the Author of <HI>The Plea&s;ure of the Ima|ginations?</HI> "Our moral Sen&s;e receives on the Occa&s;ion an additional Delight, to &s;ee that the &s;ocial Affections are in Harmony' and Proportion, and feelingly awake to the due Sen&s;ations of Humanity; and this, in Conjunction with the Gratifications, which we are apt to take in comparing the Ideas, which Reality has &s;ugge&s;ted, with tho&s;e excited by the Art of Imitation, con&s;pire to ren|der a warm and well-executed Pa&s;&s;age in Poetry, &s;o agreeable to all Mankind in general."</P>
<P>Were I to declare in which of the three Powers of the Mind, already mentioned, I think <HI>Homer, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> to be mo&s;t eminently &s;hining; I &s;hould a&s;|cribe
<PB N="253" REF="256">to <HI>Homer</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous Efforts of Imagination, and an amazing Faculty of alarming us with noble and amazing De&s;criptions of all the magni|ficent Objects in Nature. As to our own <HI>Milton,</HI> I &s;hould be inclined to declare him a Rival of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, for a comprehen&s;ive Sublimity of Conception: and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Excellence I &s;hould place in beautiful Touches of poetic Eloquence. His whole fourth Book I take to be a Ma&s;ter-piece in this Way. The various Agita|tions of Mind which <HI>Dido</HI> endures, her Love, her Jea|lou&s;y, her Rage, her Tenderne&s;s, her many mixed Emotions, are perhaps the fine&s;t Strokes in Poetry. In his &s;ixth Book al&s;o there are &s;everal Scenes of the mo&s;t tender Nature; and, in the ninth Book, the Grief of the Mother, after the Death of <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> and <HI>Euryalus,</HI> and the Lamentations of <HI>Evander,</HI> are all to be ranked in the &s;ame Cla&s;s, and, in my Opinion, af|ford a Plea&s;ure, not to be met with in either of the other Poets, even though <HI>Homer</HI> has &s;ucceeded &s;o well in <HI>Hector</HI>'s la&s;t Scene with <HI>Andromache,</HI> and though our great <HI>Mil|ton</HI> has a great Deal of finely impa&s;&s;ionated Dialogue in his ju&s;tly celebrated Poem. <HI>Virgil</HI> more frequently applies him&s;elf to the Pa&s;&s;ions of his Readers than the other two; and, notwith&s;taneing &s;ome pretty &s;trong Improbabilities, he does not &s;o frequently &s;hock our Rea&s;on, as the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet, who certainly, in &s;ome Particulars, is extravagant to the highe&s;t Degree. <HI>Mil|ton</HI> has the Advantage of having founded his Story up|on Traditions, which our Religion has &s;anctified, other|wi&s;e I &s;hould con&s;ider his fallen Angels, and the War waged by them, together with the Invention of Can|non, and many other Circum&s;tances, highly chimerical, even though they expand our Fancy with grand and &s;urprizing Appearances.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take another Opportunity to con&s;ider how far Tragedy may di&s;pute with the Epic for the Preference,
<PB N="254" REF="257">and &s;hall only add at pre&s;ent, that I have ever been of Opinion, that all the Writers of heroic Poe&s;y have, in general, been too fond of the Marvellous. By this I would not be under&s;tood to cen&s;ure the U&s;e of Machinery, which, when introduced with Sobriety and Di&s;cretion, &s;erves to pre&s;ent agreeable Scenery to the Mind; and I could wi&s;h that the Correctne&s;s of Mr. <HI>Glover</HI>'s Judg|ment had not entirely excluded it from his Poem of <HI>Leo|nidas,</HI> which certainly has many Pa&s;&s;ages of warm po|etic Eloquence, many Pieces of beautiful Imagery, and &s;everal Strictures of u&s;eful and improving Morality, artfully interwoven with the Ground-work of his Fable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall beg leave to conclude with an Ob&s;ervation, which is not entirely foreign to the Purpo&s;e. It is re|marked by Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> that <HI>Virgil</HI> has but one Conceit throughout his Poem, and that, &s;ays he, is put into the Mouth of the young <HI>Julus,</HI> when, with a Kind of punning Ambiguity, he ob&s;erves, that they are eating their Tables. But &s;urely the great Critic had forgot the Pa&s;&s;age, where the Poet tells us, that <HI>Aeneas,</HI> in runuing round a Tree after the flying <HI>Turnus,</HI> follows the Man who follows him.&mdash;<HI>Sequiturque &s;equentem.</HI></P>
<P>This, tried by the Rule of <HI>Bohours,</HI> appears to have Truth for its Foundation; but it is &s;o childi&s;h a Truth, that I am &s;orry to find it intermixed with the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Aeneid;</HI> but, perhaps, it is like the Fly on the Picture, which a minute Ob&s;erver was going to bru&s;h away, and then found it was placed there on purpo&s;e by the Hand of the Arti&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>_MIRGEHAN</HI> was a Pea&s;ant in the De|&s;arts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> he frequently begged an Alms of the Travellers in the pa&s;&s;ing Ca|ravan. For along Time he drove the loaded Camel over Mount <HI>Pharan</HI> for a Jeweller of <HI>Cairo,</HI> and having at length by an amazing Par&s;imony, got together a few Sequins of Gold, he followed the Occupation of his Ma&s;ter. Affairs thrived &s;o well with him, that in the Cour&s;e of a few Years <HI>Mirgehan</HI> began to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the Pride of Wealth, and his Countenance, which formerly was humbled by Poverty and a Dejection of Spirits, began to brighten into Gleams of Self-Satisfaction. In order to extend his Intere&s;t, and enlarge his Schemes for the Accumulation of Wealth, <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> now ba&s;king under the Sun|&s;hine of his Fortune, re&s;olved to remove to <HI>Bafra,</HI> where he was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed as the mo&s;t eminent Merchant of the Place. As it is the Nature of Ambition to be ever re&s;tle&s;s and un&s;atisfied, after having, in the Cour&s;e of &s;ix Years Re&s;idence, ama&s;&s;ed a very ample Fortune, he determined with him&s;elf to change his Abode once more, and &s;ettle him&s;elf, with all his im|men&s;e Wealth, at <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mingehan</HI> was no &s;ooner fixed at <HI>Bagdad,</HI> than the Re|putation
<PB N="257" REF="260">of his Affluence &s;pread it&s;elf abroad. In all convivial Meetings among the re&s;t of the Merchants, as &s;oon as his Lips &s;eemed to open, every Tongue was &s;u&s;pended with Silence, every Eye gazed at him with Admiration, and every Ear devoured the Periods of his Story with greedy Earne&s;tne&s;s. His Voice, which naturally was as rough as the Sound occa&s;ioned by a Colli&s;ion of Billows on the Ocean, now &s;eemed as fo&s;t as the fragrant Gale, which pants upon the Leaves of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Trees.</P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Mirgehan</HI>'s Credit was become &s;o exten|&s;ive, that People of all Ranks and Conditions depo&s;ited their Money with him, and he had every Day a very great Number of Servants counting over the Se|quins of Gold, which he was either to receive or pay away for others. In the Mid&s;t of all the&s;e Smiles of Fortune, it happened, that the Relict of a rich Merchant, lately &s;natched away from the Face of the Earth, by the Angel of Death, attracted his Attention. Her Name was <HI>Dardan&egrave;,</HI> born in the City of <HI>Damas,</HI> and now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of very great Wealth. From the Habits, which Education and Time had implanted in her, &s;he was in her Temper of a mo&s;t greedy Avarice, and a powerful Ambition to be counted richer than the re&s;t of her Acquaintance; urged by the&s;e In&s;tigations, &s;he be|&s;towed her lovely Form upon <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> who, in a &s;hort Time, &s;o contrived it, that the Ro&s;es faded on her Cheek, the Lilly appeared of a yellower Hue, and by flow Degrees, her Con&s;titution received &s;uch &s;evere Strokes from his Severity, that &s;he totally pined away, and, in a &s;hort Time, lay breathle&s;s on her Bed.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgehan</HI> was now happy in the Completion of his Wi&s;hes; he had got rid of a Wife, whom, notwith|&s;tanding her exqui&s;ite Beauty, his Soul ever abhorred, and he exulted in the Review of the va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to his Fortune, which, through her Means, he had ob|tained.
<PB N="258" REF="261">His Heatt now began to expand with greater Alacrity, and he re&s;olved to &s;pend the Remainder of his Days in Ea&s;e, in Elegance, in Luxury, and every delicate Enjoyment. The Dainties of the Ea&s;t did not &s;uffice to crown his Board; he would &s;end to the We&s;t for <HI>Turtle,</HI> and every Corner of the Globe admini&s;tred to his Gratifications. Not far from <HI>Bagdad,</HI> he purcha&s;ed a mo&s;t elegant and magnificent Hou&s;e, where he deter|mined to fix his country Retreat. The Rooms eter|nally re&s;ounded with Singers and Min&s;trels; Amber and Aloes contributed their rich Perfumes; and his Tables were covered with Va&s;es of Agate, filled with the mo&s;t delicious Liquors. Painting and Sculpture con|curred to adorn his Apartments. <HI>Mirgehan</HI> was led into all this Profu&s;ion by an irre&s;i&s;tible Vanity, from which he derived many exqui&s;ite Sen&s;ations of Plea&s;ure; when he found his Wealth and his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions admired, he the more readily &s;uffered him&s;elf to be governed by this Turn of Mind, from a Conviction, that all his grand Appearance of Affluence, &s;erved to extend his Reputation, and that, in Con&s;equence of his exten&s;ive Credit, he &s;hould have ample and frequent Opportuni|ties of re-imbur&s;ing him&s;elf, by the U&s;e he knew to make of the pecuniary Confidence, which others re|po&s;ed in him.</P>
<P><HI>Mirgehan</HI> was now happy in all the Enjoyments which Riches could procure him; his Heart danced to per|petual Tunes of Joy, and the Meanne&s;s of his Birth he thought &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated by the Lu&s;tre and Dig|nity of his pre&s;ent Way of Life. And now, to com|pleat his Elevation, and to rai&s;e him&s;elf to that Point of Eminence, from which he imagined, he might look down upon mo&s;t of his Fellow-Creatures, Fortune, who had for a Series of Years &s;miled propitiou&s;ly upon all the Undertakings of <HI>Mirgehan,</HI> at length pre&s;ented an Opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">It happened, that the Emperor of <HI>Bagdad</HI> had Occa|&s;ion, on a particular Emergence in his Affairs, to call together an A&s;&s;embly of the wi&s;e&s;t and able&s;t Heads in his Territories, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Councils, to help him in framing &s;alutary Laws, for the due Regulation of his Subjects, and to point out proper Mea&s;ures for him to levy the Monies nece&s;&s;ary towards defraying the Expences of his Soldiers, and other Contingences in Government. The <HI>Califf</HI> re&s;olved upon this Step, with the Advice of his <HI>Vizir,</HI> and, in a few Days, Mandates were di&s;patched to &s;undry different Parts, commanding the Provinces and Towns to depute to the general Di|van, two Per&s;ons the mo&s;t renowned for Sagacity and Judgment. <HI>Mirgehan</HI> was at his Country-Seat, when he heard this News, and his Pa&s;&s;ions being violent as the eddying Sand during a Tempe&s;t; he in&s;tantly con|ceived a De&s;ire to be enrolled among the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Politicians of <HI>Bagdad.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly he forthwith &s;et out upon this Expedi|tion; but he had not gone far from his own Habitation, when travelling a &s;olitary Road, over a long extended Mountain, the Heat of the Day, together with the Fatigue he had undergone, inclined him to &s;top under a &s;hady Retreat, and refre&s;h his Sen&s;es with a gentle Slumber. From this he was &s;oon awakened by a Strain of Mu&s;ick, which thrilled &s;o melodiou&s;ly in his Ears, that he thought Gleams of Paradi&s;e were opening to his dazled Sight. He looked around, and &s;aw a reverend Form advance towards him; <HI>Mirgehan</HI> aro&s;e from the Arbour, in which he was reclined; and in&s;tantly throw|ing him&s;elf on his Knees, he wor&s;hipped the venerable Appearance which &s;tood before him. This Per&s;onage was an holy Hermit, who long inhabited a &s;mall Man|&s;ion on the Side of a Rock, which terminated the Pro|&s;pect on the left Side of the Mountain. Being endowed with a magic Power, he called forth to his Sight &s;uch
<PB N="260" REF="263">beautiful Scenes, as looked like a new Creation. <HI>Mir|gehan</HI>'s Heart throbbed with holy Rapture. At length the hoary Sage began. <Q><HI>Mirgehan,</HI> I know thy Pur|po&s;e; I am acquainted with thy De&s;ign in this thy Journey. But reflect, O Man! on the Ob&s;curity of thy Birth, and the Meanne&s;s of thy Education. Can&s;t thou confer Light to the Councils of the Wi&s;e? Can&s;t thou di&s;pel the Mi&s;t from before their Eyes, and let in powerful Irradiations of Truth upon their darkling Under&s;tandings? De&s;i&s;t, vain Man, from thy ill-founded Pur&s;uits.</Q> At the&s;e Words the vene|rable Hermit waved his Wand, and &s;uddenly the Scene vani&s;hed like a Morning-Dream from <HI>Mirgehan</HI>'s Eyes. After having again rai&s;ed his Arm; <Q>Now, &s;ays he, let the Objects that are placed before thee in&s;truct thy Soul; there behold how ea&s;ily thou mighte&s;t have &s;quandered away all tho&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which thy Soul delights in for a mere empty Bubble. There &s;ee an Election for two Per&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Debates for the Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s of the Califf, and his People; &s;ee the Blind, the Lame, the Old, the In|firm, the Sick arriving in Caravans, to vote for tho&s;e who pay them highe&s;t. See how they all &s;olemnly vow by the holy Prophet, that Money has no Influ|ence upon them; and yet behold how in private they gra&s;p the Sequins of Gold! Does not thy Heart, which has fixed all its Affections upon thy yellow Dirt, tremble within thee, to think that in this Man|ner all thy Wealth might be &s;quandered away, and thou not be able to render the lea&s;t Service to the Califf, thy Country, or thy Family? That this is the Fate of many, who, like thee, have aro&s;e from mean Beginnings, and have, in their old Days, proved mere Spendthrifts, thou may'&s;t receive ocular Demon&s;tration, by &s;urveying tho&s;e Wretches, who are now de&s;pi&s;ed by their Country, dete&s;ted by their
<PB N="261" REF="264">Relations, and de&s;pi&s;ed by the <HI>Vizier,</HI> in who&s;e Ser|vice they exhau&s;ted all their Trea&s;ures.</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Zemroude</HI> (for that was the Hermit's Name) perceiving the Affections of <HI>Mirgehan</HI> perfectly changed, di&s;per&s;ed into the Air his new Creation, returned with &s;olemn Step to his Cell under the Rock, and <HI>Mirgehan</HI> ordered his Camels to be turned towards <HI>Bagdad,</HI> where he &s;pent the Remainder of his Days in Ea&s;e and Con|tent; and, at his Death, he left tho&s;e Sums of Gold, which he was going to &s;quander in vi&s;ionary Schemes, among his Relations, who now live in Affluence, and the Memory of <HI>Mirgehan</HI> is re&s;pected among them.</P>

<P>_THERE is not a Species of Writing which has not had its particular Admirer, and various Affirmations have been made con|cerning the Excellence of each. The famous Doctor <HI>South</HI> was of Opinion, that a complete Epigram is the Ma&s;ter-piece of Compo&s;ition; and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> calls a <HI>perfect Tragedy the noble&s;t Production of Human Nature.</HI> The Truth of it is, each Per&s;on has delivered his Sentiments agreeably to his own private Temper, and his own peculiar Turn of Thinking. Doctor <HI>South</HI> excelled in lively and &s;urprizing Strokes of Wit; every new Combination, which he formed in the vivacious Sallies of his Imagination, was Epi|gram in it&s;elf, and we find all his Writings &s;own ex|tremely thick with unexpected A&s;&s;emblages; and on
<PB N="263" REF="266">this Account we may &s;uppo&s;e him inclinable to extol his own favourite Talent. In like Manner, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> had employed many of his Hours in planning his Tra|gedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> and after it had received the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate Poli&s;h, which his Skill could be&s;tow upon it, it was to be exhibited as the greate&s;t Production of hu|man Wit. But the A&s;&s;ertions of great Men, when they are un&s;u&s;tained by Argument, are not to be con&s;i|dered as Decrees from which there can be no Appeal: Tragedy mo&s;t certainly can only claim the &s;econd Place, becau&s;e it is manife&s;t, that all the Powers of Genius, <HI>viz. Imagination, Eloquence</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> may be exerted in their full Force in the Epic Compo&s;ition, whereas in Tragedy they frequently &s;uffer great Limi|tation. The &s;ame Thing, which on many Occa&s;ions makes Tragedy the mo&s;t powerful Performance, &s;erves al&s;o to dive&s;t it of tho&s;e Advantages which give great Brilliancy to heroic Poe&s;y, and that is, its coming im|mediately before the Eye. It is ju&s;tly remarked by <HI>Horace,</HI> that what is conveyed to our Notice through our Ears, acts with a more feeble Impul&s;e upon the Mind, than Objects that pa&s;s through the Organs of Sight, tho&s;e faithful Evidences in a mental Court of Judicature.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Segnius irritant animos demi&s;&s;a per Aurem,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quam quae &s;unt Oculis &s;ubjecta fidelibus, &amp; quae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ip&s;e &s;ibi tradit Spectator.&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>For this Rea&s;on many Pa&s;&s;ages, in which the Epic Wrietr warms and expands the Imagination of his Readers with the noble&s;t Exhibitions of poetic Imagery, are entirely excluded from the dramatic Scene; the Eye will not &s;uffer it&s;elf ea&s;ily to be deluded, and all the Amazement of Machinery is al&s;o for the &s;ame Rea&s;on totally &s;uper&s;eded. A God, &s;ays the Critic, &s;hould
<PB N="264" REF="267">not be introduced, unle&s;s the Occa&s;ion &s;hould peremp|torily require a &s;upernatural Agent; he had &s;aid better, if he had ab&s;olutely interdicted the Appearance. We may in reading &s;uffer &s;uch an Incident to be impo&s;ed upon us; but the Eye would be too much &s;hocked with &s;uch Repre&s;entations, and, of Cour&s;e, the Mar|vellous is entirely bani&s;hed. Be&s;ides Tragedy will not admit any extraordinary Di&s;play of <HI>pure Poetry,</HI> or De|&s;cription; the heroic Poet for the mo&s;t Part &s;peaks in his own Per&s;on, and it is expected of him to pay great Court to our Imagination; but the Dialogue of Per&s;o|nages, engaged in a Sphere of Action, intended to intere&s;t the Auditors, will not allow them to take up the Scene with florid Exhibitions of rural Imagery; &s;uch as Brooks, murmuring in &s;canty Rills through peb|bled Channels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The following Lines in the Mouth of <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI> in the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> may be extremely picture&s;que, if con&s;idered as pure De&s;cription, but if con&s;idered with regard to the Situation of Character, they are certainly very inartificial and undramatic.</P>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; my &s;ad Soul</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has form'd a di&s;mal melancholy Scene:</HI></L>
<L><HI>An unfrequented Vale, o'er grown with Trees,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mo&s;&s;y and old, within who&s;e lone&s;ome Shade</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ravens and Birds ill-omen'd only dwell;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Sound to break the Silence, but a Brook</HI></L>
<L><HI>That bubbling winds among the Weeds.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Hence then we find, that in the Regions of Fancy, the <HI>Drama</HI> mu&s;t yield to the Epic, and as this is a very con&s;iderable Part of Poe&s;y, I think it determines the Precedence. In the Art of Eloquence, and in all Applications to our Rea&s;on, Tragedy can boa&s;t full Room for the mo&s;t vigorous Exertion. The <HI>Drama</HI> may be full as &s;entimental as any other Kind of Writ|ings;
<PB N="265" REF="268">nay its Excellence frequently con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;o, and with Regard to the Pa&s;&s;ions, the Mode of Imitation, renders its Influence more forcible, and when we are deceived into a Notion that the Per&s;onages are actually &s;uffering Di&s;tre&s;s before our Eyes, the Performance a&s;|&s;umes a Kind of Reality, and more keen and inten&s;er Sen&s;ations agitate our Brea&s;ts, than in Pieces where the De&s;cription is left to operate upon us without any other Aid than that of lively and impa&s;&s;ioned Expre&s;&s;ions. <HI>Virgil,</HI> I apprehend, was as &s;kilful a Ma&s;ter of the Pa&s;&s;ions as any Writer, ancient or modern; and though the Pa&s;&s;ions of his <HI>Dido</HI> are drawn with as &s;trong and glowing Colourings, as Language can be&s;tow; though their various &s;trugglings are all finely and clo&s;ely marked, though all their Vici&s;&s;itudes, Veerings and Doublings, if I may &s;o call them, are finely touched; yet, I be|lieve, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Lear</HI> and <HI>Othello</HI> have made much more lively and deep Impre&s;&s;ions upon an Audience, than ever the former has done upon his Admirers in the Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The&s;e Advantages, however, are derived to the tragic Queen from &s;upernumerary Embelli&s;hments, and from the Labours of another Art, I mean that of acting, which is in it&s;elf a Mode of Imitation, and &s;erves to render the Touches of the Writer more &s;triking, and more feelingly expre&s;&s;ive. This Superiority the Drama certainly has over the Epic, and in Con&s;equence of all its additional Aids, it can boa&s;t a more powerful Com|mand over the human Heart. It imitates the very Voice of Nature, and &s;peaks the &s;ame &s;imple and af|fecting Language. All that Profu&s;ion of Figures, which mere Poetry admits, is di&s;carded from the Stage. When I mention Figures, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Men of critical Knowledge have ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed between Figures of Speech, and Figures of the Sentiment; the former
<PB N="266" REF="269">including Metaphor and all Tran&s;tations of Phra&s;es, and the latter con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch Breaks and Tran&s;itions in Di&s;cour&s;e, as the Mind is known to make when under the Compunction of warring Pa&s;&s;ions. As for In&s;tance, when the Poet &s;ays of <HI>Dido,</HI> that &s;he is devoured by an inward Flame.
<Q><HI>Et caeco carpitur igne.</HI></Q> He then expre&s;&s;es Love by a &s;igurative Expre&s;&s;ion; but when he &s;ays,
<Q>Igno&s;cenda <HI>quidem, &s;cirent &s;i</HI> igno&s;cere <HI>manes.</HI></Q> The Repetition expre&s;&s;es the natural workings of the Mind, when other Ideas are awakened, and &s;erve to ex|cite a new Conflict of Pa&s;&s;ions. The u&s;e of the&s;e kind of Figures in Tragedy &s;hould be as free and bold as po&s;&s;ible, and with Re&s;pect to Expre&s;&s;ion, no other Re|gard is to be paid to it, than to chu&s;e &s;uch Words as may be mo&s;t &s;ignificantly picture&s;que, in order to have the more lively Effect on the Imagination, the Pa&s;&s;ions being then in a &s;tronger Ferment when lively Images are pre&s;ented to the Fancy.</P>
<P>I believe our <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> is almo&s;t the only Poet who has excelled in a ma&s;terly Power of &s;triking the <HI>Imagi|nation,</HI> the <HI>Heart,</HI> and our <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> all at once; but in him Poetry, Sentiment, and Pa&s;&s;ion are combined in the mo&s;t agreeable A&s;&s;emblage. In his Tragedy of <HI>Macbeth,</HI> there are &s;everal &s;urprizing Strokes of this <HI>Nature.</HI> Amid&s;t a great Variety of In&s;tances, the following Lines are introduced with a Solemnity &s;uitable to the Occa|&s;ion, and they carry with them a plea&s;ing Kind of gloomy Imagery.

<PB N="267" REF="270">The Soliloquy in the Tent-Scene of <HI>Richard the Third</HI> is al&s;o a further In&s;tance of the &s;ame Beauty, though by the Way it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, notwith|&s;tanding we mu&s;t allow that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was in the right to tran&s;plant <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s own Words, that they are not perfectly &s;uitable to the Character of <HI>Richard;</HI> and I believe had our great Poet thought of &s;hewing his Hero in this Situation, he would have &s;hewed <HI>Richard</HI>'s Feel|ings quite otherwi&s;e on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>To conclude: <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was certainly mi&s;taken when he called the Fable the Life and Soul of Tragedy; the Art of con&s;tructing the dramatic Story &s;hould always be &s;ub&s;ervient to the Exhibition of Character, our great <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has breathed another Soul into Tragedy, which has found the Way of &s;triking an Audience with Sentiment and Pa&s;&s;ion at the &s;ame Time.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AMONG all the Writers, who have di&s;|canted on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, I have not met with any one, that &s;eems to be thoroughly acquainted with the Subject. An ingenious Friend of mine, who furni&s;hed me with an E&s;&s;ay &s;ome Time &s;ince, reduces our pre&s;ent Party-Divi&s;ions into <HI>Garrickeans</HI> and <HI>Barryi&s;ts;</HI> but this is not going to the Bottom of Things. The famous <HI>Mon|te&s;quien</HI> has performed, in my humble Apprehen&s;ion, as little towards a Detection of the Root of the Evil, tho' he &s;eems to perceive, with a Kind of prophetic Spirit, the Declen&s;ion of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty. The great <HI>Locke,</HI> who has treated, in a very ma&s;terly Manner of Government, does not any where give us a Clue to guide our Re|&s;earch, and after glowing with <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> through a Number of Pages, we are as much in the Dark as ever. <HI>England</HI> can never be undone but by a Parliament, &s;ays the excellent Author of <HI>the U&s;e and abu&s;e of Parliaments;</HI> but even there, we are again put upon a wrong Scent. The Truth of the Matter is, ENGLAND CAN NEVER BE UNDONE BUT BY THE MOB. I am aware, this may at fir&s;t Sight appear a Paradox; but a Retro&s;pect to the Behaviour of that Body of People, will convince every intelligent Mind of the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The Generality of political Writers have wa&s;ted a great Deal of Paper in &s;ettling the various Forms of Government; one, &s;ay they, is a Monocracy; another is an Ari&s;tocracy; a third is a Democracy, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, they inform us, is of the mixed Spe|cies;
<PB N="270" REF="273">con&s;i&s;ting of a Coalition of all three. But furely a little Ob&s;ervation will point out to us, that they have all pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed another Mode of civil Policy, which cannot be called by a better Name than a <HI>Mobo|cracy,</HI> under which this Country has been for many Years pa&s;t, and in all human Probability will continue &s;o for a long Period &s;till to come; nay, I will be bold to &s;ay, until Monocracy, Ari&s;tocracy, and Democracy are all &s;wallowed up by this alone.</P>
<P>There is hardly ever a Bill brought before the ho|nourable the Hou&s;e of Commons, but the Scope of it is immediately canva&s;&s;ed in an A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Mobo|cracy;</HI> where if it pa&s;&s;es in the Negative, a Deputation is forthwith &s;ent by them to the Parliament-Hou&s;e, where, though their Remon&s;trances are not heard at the Bar, they neverthele&s;s enforce their Arguments with &s;uch a truly <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Eloquence, that they never fail to have a due Degree of Influence upon the Debates within Doors. On the&s;e Occa&s;ions, they generally make u&s;e of a Rule of Logick, which indeed is not mentioned by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> but which is always found of great Efficacy in all Di|&s;putes. The Mode of Rea&s;oning I mean, is the <HI>Argu|mentum Boculinum,</HI> a nervous Exertion of which, ac|companied with all the Force of the mo&s;t vigorous Lungs, has over ruled many an intended Act, when it happens not to plea&s;e in the Councils of the common People. The <HI>Mobecracy</HI> have further the legi&s;lative and executive Part of their Laws in their own Hands, and we find them very frequent in a diligent Attention to them. For In&s;tance, though the common Law of <HI>Eng|land</HI> has provided a proper Puni&s;hment for Pickpockets. The <HI>Mobocracy</HI> has recon&s;idered that Matter, and, after mature Deliberation, have devi&s;ed a Correction, in their Opinion, more adequate to the Offence, and whenever any one is found to incur the Penalty of their Law, they immediately proceed to Execution, without Judge or Jury, which, in their Apprehen&s;ion, &s;erve but to retard
<PB N="271" REF="274">the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and therefore they &s;eize the De|linquent, and, without Delay, duck him in the River, the Canal in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, or the next Pool of Water. On all the&s;e Occa&s;ions, it is ob&s;ervable, that they take infinite Delight in &s;eeing the proper Puni&s;h|ment inflicted, as may be ob&s;erved from the Acclama|tions, the Huzzas &amp;<HI>c.</HI> wherewith their Bur&s;t of Joy rends the Air. In like Manner, the Pillory is &s;ome Times ordained by the Statute Law of <HI>England,</HI> in or|der to expo&s;e &s;uch Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors as de&s;erve to be &s;et up the Marks of public Shame; on every Occurrence of this Nature, Wi&s;dom is &s;ure to cry out in the Streets, and the award of the Judges is determined by a popular Circle to be ju&s;t or unju&s;t. When once they have pro|nounced Sentence, the Per&s;on doomed to make his Ap|pearance is &s;ure either to meet with their Protection, or to call forth the utmo&s;t Indignation of an incen&s;ed Populace. Nay, it has been known that the&s;e perpe|tual Dictators have proceeded &s;o far as to re&s;cue Felons, condemned to &s;uffer Death, from the Hands of the pro|per Officers, and generou&s;ly to have recalled the Death-Warrant. In many Parts of <HI>England</HI> they have an im|placable Aver&s;ion to Turnpikes, and it is &s;aid they will never be at Re&s;t, until they have entirely demoli&s;hed tho&s;e di&s;agreeable Pa&s;&s;ports. I remember to have heard a Story of the&s;e People, which I think may &s;erve to give the Reader a tolerable Idea of their arbitrary Power. Not very long &s;ince three <HI>Indian</HI> Kings came to vi&s;it this Metro|polis, and, after they had &s;een mo&s;t Places of Curio&s;ity, a Play was at length advertized by Command of their <HI>Indian</HI> Maje&s;ties. The <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> who have entirely exploded all Notions of the Right Divine of Kings, and who, in Fact, con&s;ider crowned Heads as no more than common Men, took care to attend at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> in order to &s;urvey the &s;warthy Monarchs. At length the Curtain drew up, but in vain did the Players attempt to begin the Diver&s;ion of
<PB N="272" REF="275">the Night The <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> who had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Upper Gallery, declared that they came to &s;ee the Kings, <Q>and &s;ince we have &s;aid our Money, the Kings we will have.</Q> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> who was then one of the Patentees, came forth and a&s;&s;ured them that the Kings were in the Front-Box; to this the <HI>Mo|bocracy</HI> replied, that they could not &s;ee them there, and defired that they &s;hould be placed in a more con&s;picuous point of View, <Q>otherwi&s;e, by G&mdash;d <HI>Jack,</HI> there &s;hall be no Play.</Q> Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> who was not in his Heart of Mo|bocratical Principles, yet loved his own Intere&s;t &s;o well, that he always knew how to be an occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t, a&s;&s;ured them that he had nothing &s;o much at Heart as their Happine&s;s, and accordingly got three Chairs and placed the Kings on the Stage, to the no &s;mall Satisfaction of the <HI>Mobocracy,</HI> with whom it is a Maxim to have as much as po&s;&s;ible for their Money. From hence it ap|pears that the Power of the Multitude is perfectly Dicta|torial; and, indeed, in all Ages the Managers of Play|hou&s;es have acquie&s;ced under the Gallery-Juri&s;diction. Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> I am credibly informed, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Bows he occa&s;ionally makes them, is not entirely reconciled to their Government, and, it is &s;aid, is very apt to quote certain trea&s;onable Words from <HI>Horace,</HI> implying that the Vulgar have no claim to In|&s;allibility. <HI>Interdum Vulgus Rectum videt, e&s;t ubi peccat.</HI> My Intelligence further adds, that he has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed many Schemes for adding Novelty to the Amu&s;ements of the Public, from a Fear he has conceived of the many-headed Mon&s;ter of the Gallery; nay, he will at Times carry Matters &s;o far as to pronounce their Beha|viour illegal, arbitrary, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and, when they broke all the Windows of his Dwelling-Hou&s;e, &s;o di&s;contented a Spirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, that he would by no Means ac|knowledge the Ju&s;tice of their Proceedings.</P>
<P>Be that as it may; it is certain one di&s;&s;affected Per|&s;on cannot with&s;tand the <HI>Mobocratical</HI> Power, which it
<PB N="273" REF="276">is manife&s;t has gained great Strength of late Years, and, I am per&s;uaded, will continue to flouri&s;h more and more every Day. They have many wi&s;e Maxims by which they govern them&s;elves; &s;uch as, "no wooden Shoes", &mdash;"Liberty and Property and no Exci&s;e"&mdash;<Q>no <HI>French</HI> Dancers</Q>&mdash;"no Moun&s;eers"&mdash;Let every Man toa&s;t his own Chee&s;e, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> &s;uch prudential Axioms, founded on the &s;obere&s;t Sen&s;e, mu&s;t undoubtedly con|tribute to render their Admini&s;tration both wi&s;e and pro&s;perous. It does not appear that they have made any great Progre&s;s in the modern Art of War; on the contrary, there is Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that they all hold it in Contempt; as it is certain that on many Occa&s;ions, when our mixed Form of Government has endeavoured to oppo&s;e them, by &s;ending the Soldiery again&s;t them, they have always laughed at the Military Force, and re|pelled them from the A&s;&s;ault, without their daring to Fire. Their Military Di&s;cipline &s;eems to be derived from the <HI>Romans;</HI> they know no U&s;e of Cannon, Fire-Arms, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> but proceed to Battle with Sticks, Bludgeons, &s;etting up loud Shouts, &s;omewhat like the War-hoop of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and hurling Stones, Brickbats, Bottles, Gla&s;&s;es, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> with tremendous Force on the adver&s;e Party. They are likewi&s;e totally Strangers to all Re|&s;inements of modern Luxury; Bread and Chee&s;e, and Porter being their chief Su&s;tenance; Gin being only u&s;ed by them when they are low-&s;pirited, or are going to be hanged. They do not paint their Bodies with Woad, like the ancient <HI>Britons,</HI> but generally with Kennel-Dirt, which lends them a formidable Air in Battle Thus enured to Danger, it will be no wonder if the <HI>Mobocracy</HI> at length becomes Ma&s;ters of this King|dom, which, as I conceive it, mu&s;t &s;hortly be the Ca&s;e, unle&s;s the Vices of People of Fa&s;hion &s;hould de&s;cend to them, and retard them in their Progre&s;s. Of this, I mu&s;t own I am inclined to cheri&s;h &s;ome Hopes, as I am in|formed, that, in &s;ome Parts of the Town, they drink,
<PB N="274" REF="277">and game and &s;wear, and are full as wicked as the better Sort of People. Particularly in <HI>Hockly the Hole,</HI> I am told, that they have a Place called <HI>White</HI>'s Chocolate|hou&s;e, that <HI>clean Lodgings for Travellers</HI> are dearer than ever, and that you cannot any where <HI>Shave for a Penny,</HI> the Depravity of the Times having rai&s;ed the Prices of every Thing there, as well as at the St. <HI>James</HI>'s End of the Town.</P>

<P>AFTER a Soliloquy, which I have this Morning held with my&s;elf, agreeably to the Advice of Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> the Up&s;hot was, that I determined to in|form the courteous Reader, that the Plan of the <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn Journal</HI> is now drawing towards a Conclu&s;ion, and in the Cour&s;e of a few Papers more, <HI>Ranger</HI> mu&s;t &s;ub|&s;ide into an ab&s;olute Silence. Whether he is then to &s;ink into Ob&s;curity, like many other evane&s;cent Pro|ductions, or whether a new Edition of the&s;e Papers, in &s;mall Volumes, will hinder them from &s;haring the Fate of the <HI>Sybils</HI> Leaves, which are generally &s;cattered away without any Trace of them left behind, Time only can determine. Thus much <HI>Ranger</HI> thinks proper to &s;ay on this Occa&s;ion, that he only begs, that the Gale of In|dulgence, which has hitherto wa&s;ted him through a Sea of Troubles, may not, now he is in Sight of his Har|hour, die away, and-leave him with &s;lackened Cordage and &s;luttering Sails to come in with di&s;graceful Labour, like the baffled Hero in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Ship-Race;

And whatever &s;hall be the Deci&s;ion of the Public on his Genius or Inability, he will &s;tand con|vinced of their Equity, and will not &s;uffer fond Self-love to lodge an Appeal in his own Brea&s;t; he only hopes, that if the Verdict be found again&s;t him, it may be, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Elizabeth Canning,</HI> with this qualifying Circum&s;tance; GUILTY of DULLNESS, but not WIL|FUL and CORRUPT.</P>

<P><HI>_A Ri&s;totle</HI> informs us that <HI>Homer</HI> wrote a Co|mic-Epic Poem entitled <HI>Margites,</HI> which to the no &s;mall Detriment of &s;ucceeding Ages, is unfortunately lo&s;t. To this Spe|cies of Poe&s;y, we may &s;uppo&s;e Comedy has the &s;ame Reference, that the Tragic bears to the Heroic. For my Part, I cannot conceive why a good Comedy has never been &s;tiled by tho&s;e, who are fond of deciding literary Precedence, the greate&s;t Production of human Nature. Certainly its con&s;i&s;ting of known and familiar Ideas, &s;hould not derogate from its Merit, becau&s;e on Account of that very Circum&s;tance, it meets with le&s;s Indulgence; the Bu&s;ine&s;s of it coming more near to every Man's Brea&s;t, and, of Cour&s;e, the very Vulgar being in &s;ome Mea&s;ure Judges of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Imitation; whereas, in Tragedy, frigid Declamation lulls, florid Epithets amu&s;e, lofty Metaphors amaze, and &s;onorous Expre&s;&s;ions elevate and &s;urprize.</P>
<P>As Tragedy aims more particularly at an Excitement of the &s;erious Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o the chief Merit of <HI>Comedy</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in its Effect on the merry Affections of the hu|man Mind; the former principally awakening Sen|&s;ations of Terro, and Pity, and the latter giving Emo|tions of a gay Contempt, as it is elegantly called, or in plainer <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> making us de&s;pi&s;e and laugh at an Ob|ject at the &s;ame Time. To &s;ucceed in this la&s;t men|tioned Mode of Writing, it requires as fine and as lively
<PB N="277" REF="280">an Imagination as any of the other imitative Arts; for as it is manife&s;t, that the Tragic Poet then excites in us the mo&s;t inten&s;e Sen&s;ations, when his Expre&s;&s;ions con|vey the livelie&s;t Images to the Fancy, &s;o the Comic Poet, when he &s;eizes the Imagination with a bright A&s;&s;emblage of ludicrous Ideas, is &s;ure of agitating tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, to which his Art directs him, with an irre|&s;i&s;tible Power. And therefore this Animadver&s;ion is &s;ufficient to put an End to that idle Di&s;pute, which, as we learn from <HI>Horace,</HI> engaged the Learned, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether Comedy might be called Poetry or not.
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;quidam Comoedia necne Poema</HI></L>
<L><HI>E&s;&s;et quae&s;ivere&mdash;</HI></L></Q> It is manife&s;t that it is an imitative Art, and different Pa&s;|&s;ions being the Objects of its Addre&s;s, it only makes u&s;e of Means different from the more elevated Species of Writing; but &s;urely it is full as hard a Ta&s;k to paint or|dinary Things, as Objects of more Importance; and, in my Opinion, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Line which de&s;cribes an old Woman running acro&s;s <HI>Dido</HI>'s Apartment with officious Zeal,
<Q><HI>Illa gradum &s;tudio celerabat anili,</HI></Q> Is as picture&s;que and has as much Merit as the De&s;crip|tion of the ambro&s;ial Locks of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Ambro&s;iaeque comae divinum vertice odorem,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spiravere.&mdash;</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Comic Writer, as well as the Tragedian, mu&s;t derive his Force from the true primary Sources of Com|po&s;ition; that is to &s;ay, he mu&s;t learn to &s;eize our <HI>Ima|ginations,</HI> with &s;triking Pictures of human Life; he mu&s;t in&s;truct our Rea&s;on by in&s;erting &s;en&s;ible Ob&s;erva|tions on worldly Contingencies, and he mu&s;t al&s;o fre|quently apply him&s;elf to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which it is the Merit of his Art to awaken. In this la&s;t mentioned
<PB N="278" REF="281">Particular con&s;i&s;ts the real Merit of a well wrought Comedy; in like Manner as the &s;erious Drama mu&s;t fill us with Ideas proper to excite Terror and Pity. To obtain either Effect, the Poet is to &s;elect &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances in every Object, in every Pa&s;&s;ion, and in every Action, as will be mo&s;t conducive to his peculiar End, and he is con&s;tantly to avail him&s;elf of &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions as will &s;erve to convey the livelie&s;t Images to the Fancy. When this is rightly performed, whether in the &s;olemn or humourous Scene, it is true Poetry, and in either ca&s;e it is by the Means of a Mode of Elo|quence, that the Art produces its de&s;ired Effect. For Ridicule, by which Comedy works, is as much a Mode of Eloquence, as the &s;everal Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion, and the &s;everal Figures, which Rhetoric has reduced into a Sy&s;tem for the Excitement of the more &s;erious Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Di&s;pute that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the Learned for a con&s;iderable Time, and is perhaps not yet determined, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether Ridicule is a Te&s;t of Truth, is, in my humble Opinion, extremely idle and frivolous; the Fa|culty of Rea&s;on, which compares our Ideas, and fu|&s;tains or rejects the various Affirmations concerning them, being the &s;ole Judge of Truth, however com|plicated the Means may be by which it gains its End. I have often wondered, that neither <HI>Ari&s;totle, Tully,</HI> nor <HI>Quintilian,</HI> have given a ju&s;t and adequate De&s;inition of Ridicule. To &s;ay that it con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing our Laugh|ter at &s;ome Turpitude, is a very in&s;ufficient Account of the Matter. Mr. <HI>Fulding,</HI> in his Preface to his <HI>Jo&s;eph Andrews,</HI> has thrown &s;ome Light upon the Matter, but as he places the Source of it in Affectation, he appears to me not to have taken a comprehen&s;ive Survey of his Subject. I apprehend the Ridiculous may be formed, where there is no Affectation at the Bottom, and his Par&s;on <HI>Adams</HI> I take to be an In&s;tance of this A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282">The be&s;t and mo&s;t accurate De&s;inition I have ever met with of the Ridiculous is in a Note of Doctor <HI>Aken|&s;ide</HI>'s to his excellent Poem <HI>on the Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion.</HI> <Q>That, &s;ays he, which makes Objects ridiculous is &s;ome Ground of Admiration or E&s;teem connected with other more general Circum&s;tances, compara|tively worthle&s;s or deformed; or it is &s;ome Circum|&s;tances of Turpitude or Deformity connected with|what is in general excellent or beautiful; the incon|&s;i&s;tent Properties exi&s;ting either in the Objects them|&s;elves, or in the Apprehen&s;ion of the Per&s;on to whom they relate, implying Sentiment or De&s;ign, and exciting no acute or vehement Emotion of the Heart.</Q> The Effect which the Circum&s;tances thus &s;pecified have upon us he thus de&s;ines; <Q>the Sen&s;ation of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Di&s;agreement of Ideas, but a Pa&s;&s;ion or Emotion of the Mind con&s;equential to that Perception.</Q></P>
<P>The Emotions here intended are Laughter and Con|tempt, and the&s;e it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Comedy to excite, by making &s;triking Exhibitions of incon&s;i&s;tent Circum|&s;tances, blended together in &s;uch a thwarting A&s;&s;em|blage, that a gay Contempt irre&s;&s;i&s;tibly &s;hall take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of us. To perform this in all Objects which come before the Comic Mu&s;e, in Men and Manners, in all Actions and Pa&s;&s;ions, requires a very delicate Hand, and it frequently is nece&s;&s;ary to have an almo&s;t micro|&s;copic Eye to perceive the latent Incon&s;i&s;tency in Cir|cum&s;tances &s;eemingly fair and prai&s;e-worthy. <HI>Prion</HI> has expre&s;&s;ed this with his u&s;ual Delicacy;
<Q><L><HI>And tho' the Error may be &s;uch</HI></L>
<L><HI>As</HI> Knaggs <HI>and</HI> Burge&s;s <HI>cannot hit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>It yet may feel the nicer Touch,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of</HI> Wycherly <HI>or</HI> Congreve'<HI>s Wit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In producing Portraits of Mankind it is not enough to di&s;play Foibles and Oddities; a fine Vein of Ridi|cule mu&s;t run through the whole, to urge the Mind to
<PB N="280" REF="283">frequent Emotions of Laughter; otherwi&s;e there will be Danger of exhibiting di&s;agreeable Characters with|out affording the proper Entertainment I think <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> extremely apt to err in this Point; his <HI>Moro&s;e,</HI> is a &s;urly, ill-natured, ab&s;urd Humouri&s;t, whom we can hardly laugh at, and he &s;oon becomes very bad Company. Many of <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s Characters are of the &s;ame Ca&s;t, while in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> the ridiculous Ideas are placed in &s;uch an artful Point of View, that our Merriment can never be re&s;trained, whenever Sir <HI>John</HI> appears. <HI>Congreve</HI> in my Opinion had a great Deal of the &s;ame Talent, and what I have &s;omewhere &s;een objected to him, that many of his Characters are obvious in human Life, is with me a &s;trong Proof of his &s;uperior Genius. An Old <HI>Batchelor,</HI> for In&s;tance, is very common, but he mu&s;t pa&s;s through &s;uch an Imagination as <HI>Congreve</HI>'s to &s;upport &s;everal Scenes in the Drama with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;antry; tho' the Character was not new, yet his Management of it has all the Graces of Novelty, and the Situations in which we &s;ee him are all exqui&s;itely ridiculous. Per&s;onages of this Cla&s;s, unle&s;s artfully conducted, may very &s;oon tire an Audience, but in this excellent Poet's Hands nothing &s;uffers a Diminution. The &s;ame, I think, ap|pears in his Sir <HI>Paul Plyant,</HI> in which Character there is perhaps as much Comic Force as in any one Piece on the Stage. Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI> was al&s;o a perfect Ma&s;ter of his Art in this Re&s;pect, and of this his Sir <HI>John Brute</HI> is a remarkable Proof. The Knight is con&s;tantly di|verting us with an odd whim&s;ical Way of Thinking, which at once &s;erves to di&s;play his own Foibles, and en|tertains his Audience with a Plea&s;antry of which he &s;eems all along totally uncon&s;cious him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is therefore by placing the Humours and Foibles of human Nature in a ridiculous Light, that the true Comic Force is created. The Author of <HI>the Plea&s;ures of Imagination,</HI> whom I have already quoted, has judi|ciou&s;ly
<PB N="281" REF="284">explained each Part of the De&s;inition cited above, and has finely traced the &s;everal Sources from which true Ridicule &s;prings. Whoever chu&s;es to con&s;ider the Matter will find Affectation to be but one Spring, how|ever diffu&s;ive the Streams of it may be. To the Poem it&s;elf I beg leave to refer my Readers, and I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this Paper, with ob&s;erving, that the whole Beauty of the Comic Diction con&s;i&s;ts in the Words and Phra&s;es being &s;o cho&s;en as to give to the Mind the mo&s;t lively Impre&s;&s;ion of known and familiar Images, and at the &s;ame Time the &s;tronge&s;t Marks of Character and each Per&s;on's peculiar Temper.</P>

<P>_HAVING in my la&s;t offered &s;ome cur&s;ory Remarks upon RIDICULE, I &s;hall in this Day's Paper take Notice of a Species of Writing, which on Account of &s;ome Af|finity between them, is often &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame with the Ridiculous; and yet, upon an attentive View of the Matter, it appears to be a Mode of Compo&s;i|tion introduced by Men of Genius in order to fall in with that Propen&s;ity to Laughter, which prevails with all Mankind in general. What I here intend is <HI>Bur|le&s;que;</HI> to mark its Boundaries, its Procedure and Ex|tent, will be no improper Subject among the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, which only pretend now and then to glance &s;o much Light upon Matters of this Nature, as may &s;erve to illu|&s;trate them to the Unlearned.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that as the <HI>Ridiculous</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a Coalition of Circum&s;tances repugnant to each other in their own Natures, but yet whim&s;ically blended to|gether in any Object, any human Action or Pa&s;&s;ion, to call forth this Incon&s;i&s;tency to public View, and to &s;hew the heterogeneous A&s;&s;emblage, in &s;uch a Manner as to provoke the Mind to laugh at it with Contempt, is to exert the rare and excellent talent of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> and as this when well executed is attended with fine con&s;e|quential Effects, the Lovers of <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> will not wait to di&s;cover a real Incongruity, but by the Force of their own Imaginations they create it for them&s;elves, and by
<PB N="284" REF="287">obtruding Circum&s;tances, which perhaps do not belong to the Object, they are frequently very &s;ucce&s;sful in rendering Things apparently ridiculous, which to an attentive Eye may not wear the motly Livery, however it may &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of Mirth to inve&s;t it with it. In order to explain more fully what is here in&s;i&s;ted on, it may not be improper to lay before the Reader a few In&s;tances of the <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> and al&s;o of <HI>Burle&s;que,</HI> which may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;erve to render this Matter &s;till more intelligible and clear.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Par&s;on <HI>Adams</HI> in Di&s;tre&s;s at an Inn, retires very gravely with a <HI>London</HI> Book&s;eller to rai&s;e Money upon &s;ome Manu&s;cript Sermons, I believe the di&s;&s;onant Circum&s;tances in this Ca&s;e &s;trike very forcibly, and our Laughter is &s;till urged with greater Impetuo|&s;ity, when, after having travelled a great many Miles from his own Place of Abode towards <HI>London,</HI> with no other Bu&s;ine&s;s upon Earth, but to di&s;po&s;e of the&s;e Ser|mons, we hear the Par&s;on not being able to find them, very gravely &s;ay, <Q>I prote&s;t I believe I left them be|hind me.</Q> When the &s;ame Per&s;onage a&s;&s;ures us, that he is very rich, and then adds, that he does not &s;ay it by way of boa&s;ting or complying with worldly Vanity, but to &s;hew that he can live well on the Road, and, to confirm this, produces half a Guinea, the Dif|ference between his Opinion and the &s;mall Value of the Piece, and this too from a Clergyman, a Scholar, and in many Things a Man of excellent Under&s;tanding, produces an Emotion of Laughter attended in this In|&s;tance with a Contempt for <HI>Adams</HI>'s Want of Know|ledge of the World. In like manner, when <HI>Don Quixote</HI> very gravely &s;ays, that he has &s;een the Sea, and that it is much larger than the River at <HI>La Mancha,</HI> we can|not help laughing at a Man who has formed his Ideas of Things by what he has &s;een at his own native Place, and to find an in&s;igni&s;icant River compared to the Sea,
<PB N="285" REF="288">pre&s;ents &s;uch a repugnant Conjunction of Images, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily operate upon our ri&s;ible Faculties.</P>
<P>The&s;e In&s;tances, which have fir&s;t, among a Thou&s;and, offered them&s;elves to my Memory, are true In&s;tances of the <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> nothing here being obtruded upon our Imaginations; but in <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> there are many adventi|tious Ideas called up, in order to form a motly Concur|rence of thwarting Images, and &s;o produce the &s;ame Effect with the really <HI>Ridiculous.</HI> As for In&s;tance, if any Object which comes before the <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> Writer, be low in its own Nature, he immediately bethinks him|&s;elf of conferring on it a mock Dignity, in which it begins to look big, like the Champion at a Corona|tion, who boldly challenges all Mankind when he knows no Body will fight him. I have ever been highly plea&s;ed with a Touch of this Kind in a Note to Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>'s <HI>Tom Thumb,</HI> where mentioning &s;omething of the Soul of Man, he gravely tells us, <Q><HI>Plato</HI> is of this Opinion, and &s;o is Mr. <HI>Banks.</HI></Q> The Stroke in the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera</HI> is of the &s;ame Nature &mdash;<Q>There is no|thing &s;o moving as a great Man in Di&s;tre&s;s.</Q> In this Ca&s;e the great Di&s;proportion between the two Objects &s;trikes our Imagination, and our Laughter bur&s;ts out at that which is, without Foundation, &s;et in Competition. In the following Pa&s;&s;age of the Poet, it &s;eems to me, there is a ridiculous Appearance intended by giving a mock Maje&s;ty to an Object in the general Opinion not &s;o highly exalted.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Oh! could I view thro'</HI> London <HI>as I pa&s;s</HI></L>
<L><HI>Some broad Sir</HI> Balaam <HI>in</HI> Corinthian <HI>Bra&s;s!</HI></L>
<L><HI>High on a</HI> Pede&s;tal, <HI>ye Freemen place</HI></L>
<L><HI>His magi&s;terial Paunch and griping Face.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Letter'd and gilt let him</HI> adorn <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And grant the</HI> Trade&s;man, <HI>what a</HI> King's <HI>deny'd.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Thus the ludicrous A&s;&s;emblage is formed by an A&s;&s;o|ciation of Ideas, which we are diverted to &s;ee joined
<PB N="286" REF="289">together. The other Method of <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> is, if an Ob|ject has any Thing re&s;pectable about it, to join it with Images, not only inferior, but in them&s;elves con|temptible. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is very frequent in this Kind of Satyr throughout his <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and <HI>Boileau</HI> is, I think, admirable in both Species of <HI>Burle&s;que,</HI> in his <HI>Lutrin.</HI> Our own <HI>Garth</HI> al&s;o has many beautiful Pa&s;&s;ages in his <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary,</HI> where a Ridicule is thrown upon his Heroes by a&s;&s;ociating with them Images of Things, to which &s;ome Kind of Turpitude is adherent; thus a Set of <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> quarrelling among them&s;elves are finely placed in a ludicrous Light by the following humourous Simile.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Thus often at the</HI> Temple <HI>Stairs we've &s;een</HI></L>
<L><HI>Two</HI> Tritons <HI>of a rough athletic Mien,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sourly di&s;pate &s;ome Quarrel of the Flood,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Knuckles bruis'd, and Face be&s;mear'd with Blood;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But at the fir&s;t Appearance of a Fare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Both quit the Fray, and to their Oars repair.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Another very common Method of <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> is by making frequent Application of grand and &s;ublime Pa&s;&s;ages in our be&s;t Poets to Things unworthy and mean. <HI>Bioleau</HI> is, in my Opinion, the happie&s;t of all modern Poets in this Particular. As Pa&s;&s;ages of this Nature are frequently mi&s;taken for an Intent to <HI>bur|le&s;que</HI> the Author, from whom the Image is borrowed, it may not be improper in this Place to ob&s;erve, that Parody does not always carry with it any Sneer at the Author parodied. The be&s;t Lines in <HI>Virgil</HI> may be aptly applied to other Objects, without his being burle&s;qued, and we find that <HI>Vida</HI> in his elegant and beautiful Poem on the <HI>Game of Che&s;s,</HI> has al|mo&s;t in every Line &s;urprized us with Expre&s;&s;ions from the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> by which means he gives Spi|rit and Life to his Poem, animates his imaginary War|riours with human Pa&s;&s;ions, and fills the Fancy with en|tertaining Ideas of mock heroic Maje&s;ty. The De|&s;cription
<PB N="287" REF="290">of the Havock at a Game of Che&s;s is per|fectly elegant.
<Q><L><HI>Sternitur omne &s;olum buxo atque mi&s;errima caedes</HI></L>
<L><HI>Exoritur; confu&s;a inter &s;e&s;e agmina caedunt,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Implicitaeque ruunt, albae, nigraeque Phalanges;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sternuntur pedites &amp; corpora quadrupedantum.</HI></L></Q> The De&s;cription of the Queen is al&s;o highly beautiful.
<Q><L><HI>At medias inter acies crude&s;cit Amazon.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Candida, plena animis, medii&s;que in millibus ardet.</HI></L></Q> It is plain, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Account of a Game at Cards in the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> has imitated this excel|lent Poet in his Manner of exalting inanimate Things, which can never carry with it any Air of <HI>Burle&s;que,</HI> be|cau&s;e nothing can be ridiculous, but when a free Agency is applied.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Burle&s;que,</HI> as in every other Kind of Writing, Truth &s;hould be the Foundation, otherwi&s;e the Super|&s;tructure mu&s;t fall, like <HI>Ari&s;iophanes</HI>'s Ridicule of <HI>Socrates,</HI> which is now held in Contempt, as will always be the Ca&s;e with every Piece of ill-founded Plea&s;antry; be|cau&s;e the Object thus attacked mu&s;t be always excep|tionable, otherwi&s;e it can never be e&s;&s;entially hurt by a fal&s;e Combination of adventitious Ideas. As there is a &s;trong Propen&s;ity in the Generality of People to this Kind of Humour, Tragic Poets, in particular, &s;hould be cautious how, by any Pa&s;&s;age or Expre&s;&s;ion, they ex|cite ludicrous Images. If once in the mo&s;t &s;erious Scene a wrong A&s;&s;ociation of Ideas be formed, the Mind is apt to attach it&s;elf to the Object of its Mirth, and thus a well-imagined Plece may be ob&s;tructed. A very elegant Critic ob&s;erves, that the following Line of <HI>Dryden.</HI>
<Q><HI>A Star light Morning, and an Ev'ning fair.</HI></Q> Has in it nothing improper, and yet, if any one recol|lects that a <HI>Star-light Morning</HI> is the Language of a
<PB N="288" REF="291">Watchman it may occa&s;ion &s;ome &s;prightly Raillery. On this account, in all the different &s;pecies of Compo|&s;ition the Writer mu&s;t carefully remember to keep with|in his proper Boundaries, becau&s;e the lea&s;t Excur&s;ion too far may be highly prejudicial, and give room to &s;mall Wits either to point incongruous Circum&s;tances, or to obtrude them upon the Reader's Imagination.</P>

<P>_IT is a general Complaint made by my fair Countrywomen, that the Gentlemen, re|gardle&s;s of that Re&s;pect and Attention which are at all Times due to their Charms, &s;hew a great Aver&s;ene&s;s to their Company. I fear this Charge cannot be controverted, and am &s;orry to &s;ee the Truth mani&s;e&s;ted in the con&s;trained Deportment, in ele|gant Addre&s;s, and uncouth Attempts at Politene&s;s, that almo&s;t univer&s;ally characterize the Youth of this I&s;land.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that a frequent, liberal Intercour&s;e with that more refined Part of our Species, which is happily de&s;cribed by the Appellation of the <HI>Beau Sex,</HI> &s;o power|fully influences, not only our Manner and Behaviour, but our Way of thinking, that from thence we acquire a certain Delicacy of Sentiment, which extends it&s;elf even to the mo&s;t minute Circum&s;tances of Life. And from hence it is, that our Neighbours, the <HI>French,</HI> have e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout <HI>Europe</HI> that Character of Polite|ne&s;s, which we do not chu&s;e to be at the Trouble of emulating, as we find it much more ea&s;y to ridicule and laugh at it. My Lord <HI>Anglois,</HI> while the Profu&s;ion, with which he di&s;per&s;es his Guineas, creates A&s;toni&s;hment in the Mechanics of <HI>Paris,</HI> con&s;cious of a De&s;iciency in that Ea&s;e and elegant Freedom, which he ob&s;erves in every Man of Education whom he meets, &s;huns all good Company; and after reluctantly &s;pending three Months between the <HI>H&ocirc;tel</HI> and the &s;everal Places of public Diver&s;ion, returns to his native Soil, &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed

<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI> has no more Idea of a Party of Plea&s;ure, without Ladies, than an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can entertain the lea&s;t Conception of enjoying him&s;elf, until they retreat. From tho&s;e oppo&s;ite Di&s;po&s;itions it ari&s;es, that the fir&s;t introduces him&s;elf with a becoming Unconcern into Company, and Ma&s;ter of that <HI>Bien&s;eance,</HI> which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the Gentleman, and performs all Offices of Life, without the lea&s;t Embara&s;&s;ment: Whereas nothing is more common among us, than to find Gentlemen of Fa|mily and Fortune, who know nothing of the Fair-Sex, but what they have collected from the mo&s;t abandoned Part of it, and can &s;carce reckon a virtuous Family, within the whole Scope of their Acquaintance. It is not unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve one of this Cla&s;s, when Chance or Nece&s;&s;ity has brought him into a Room with Ladies of Reputation. An aukward Re&s;traint hangs a|bout him, and he is almo&s;t afraid to &s;peak, lea&s;t he &s;hould inadvertently bolt out &s;omething, which, tho' extremely &s;uitable to the Dialect of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> would be gro&s;ly offen&s;ive to tho&s;e Females, who had not received their Rudiments of Education in that Seminary. The Gloom that hangs over an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company, while the Ladies remain, and the reciprocal Re&s;traint, that each Sex &s;eems to be upon the other, has been fre|quently a Subject of ludicrous Ob&s;ervations to Foreign|ers; and indeed, the Fair-ones them&s;elves, <HI>tho' Natives, and to the Manner born,</HI> frequently expre&s;s A&s;toni&s;hment, what My&s;teries the Men can have to celebrate, &s;o oppo|&s;ite to tho&s;e of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> that no Female mu&s;t be pre&s;ent at the Ceremony. I am not at Liberty to di|vulge
<PB N="292" REF="295">this important Secret, but will, for the Satisfaction of the Ladies, a&s;&s;ure them, that they are not of a Nature va&s;tly beyond their Apprehen&s;ion; nay, on the contrary, may be ca&s;ily under&s;tood, even by a Mi&s;s in Hanging-Sleeves, provided &s;he has had the Happine&s;s of a Board|ing-School Education.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, that I condemn my Countrymen for &s;eparating them&s;elves from tho&s;e, who have the Art of refining every Joy this World affords, I am &s;orry to be obliged to ob&s;erve, that the Ladies them&s;elves do, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, contribute to this great Evil. The &s;can|dalcus Practice, &s;o prevalent at pre&s;ent, of giving up their whole Thoughts, as well as Time, to Cards, has made the Company of Women, pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion, extremely in&s;ipid to tho&s;e, who would willingly con&s;ider them as rational Creatures, and do not depend upon &s;u|perior Skill in the Game of Whi&s;t for a Sub&s;i&s;tance. Is it to be imagined, that a Man, who&s;e Mind is the lea&s;t rai&s;ed above the Vulgar, will devote that Time, which he may employ in conver&s;ing agreeably either with the Dead or the Living, to tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, where no Ideas enter beyond the re&s;pective Excellencies of <HI>Garrick</HI> and <HI>Barry,</HI> and the &s;everal po&s;&s;ible Ca&s;es, &s;o profoundly calculated by the incomparable Mr. <HI>Hoyle?</HI> Yet from declining the&s;e Places, I know many intimate Friends, who have acquired the odious Character of Women-haters, tho' at the &s;ame Time, they entertain the highe&s;t E&s;teem for that amiable Sex, and &s;incerely regret, that the Tyrant Fa&s;hion has put it out of their Power to enjoy more of their Company, than a bare View of their Per&s;ons, agitated by the various and un|certain Revolutions of Fortune's Wheel.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I have already mentioned, another Ob|&s;tacle, extremely pernicious to Society, proceeds from the exce&s;&s;ive Officiou&s;ne&s;s of the female World in cut|ing out Matches. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has ob&s;erved, that <HI>every Women is at Heart a Rake,</HI> and I believe it is not le&s;s
<PB N="293" REF="296">true, though I fear the A&s;&s;ertion will be much more offen&s;ive to the Virgins of <HI>Britain,</HI> that <HI>every Woman is a Fortune-hunter.</HI> This Character is de&s;ervedly infamous in the male Part of the Creation, and we dete&s;t the Man, <HI>though of an exceeding good Family in</HI> Ireland, who, aided by the Friend&s;hip and Confidence of his Taylor, makes a pompous Di&s;play of the Breadth of his Shoul|ders, and the Firmne&s;s of his Calves; but conceive no Indignation again&s;t the lovely Nymph, who <HI>undre&s;&s;es</HI> her&s;elf, in the &s;ame View, with the mo&s;t &s;educing Art, and generou&s;ly, much too generou&s;ly, for her own In|tere&s;t! exhibits every Charm the happy Man will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, who takes her to his Po&s;om. The Idea of entrapping &s;omebody mixes &s;o intimately with the ge|neral Ca&s;t of Thought in Women, that they can never dive&s;t them&s;elves of it, and if a Gentleman pays that Compliment to their Beauty, which female Pride would never Pardon, if he had omitted, they immediately flatter them&s;elves, that he mu&s;t have a De&s;ign of Mar|riage.

<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal Mi&s;demeanors of the P&s;endo-Critics, who now &s;tand at the Bar of this honourable Court, are of as glaring a Die as ever came under the Cognizance of a Seat of Judicature, intended to be &s;upplemental to the Laws of the Land. It is ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash; Le&s;s dangerous is th'Offence</HI></L>
<L><HI>To tire our Patience, than mi&s;lead our Sen&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Now I appeal to the impartial Opinion of every Rea|der, who has thought it worth his while to turn over the Leaves of the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> whether more malicious, fal&s;e, and ill-grounded Critici&s;ms were ever &s;ent Abroad into the World, &s;ince the Days of <HI>Zoilus,</HI> down to the pre&s;ent <HI>Aera</HI> of the&s;e notable Reviewers? I am per|&s;uaded, Gentlemen of the Jury, that a more gro&s;s Im|po&s;ition was never offer'd to the Republick of Letters, than for a Book&s;eller, who&s;e Sign is ju&s;tly <HI>emblematical</HI> of his Authors, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to take upon him to dictate to the Public in a Work, conducted by ob&s;cure
<PB N="298" REF="301">Hirelings, Country Schoolma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Certain it is that a critical Performance, under the Direction of Gen|tlemen, and Scholars, written with Ta&s;te, Impartiality, and Erudition might be highly &s;erviceable to the Cau&s;e of Literature. A Man, for In&s;tance, who &s;hould give &s;uch an Account of Works of Ta&s;te, as <HI>Pere Brumoy</HI> has of the <HI>Greek</HI> Dramatic Poets, would de&s;erve to be cheri&s;hed by the Public, and the Book&s;eller, who &s;hould publi&s;h &s;uch a Performance would acquire Honour and Reputation in his Bu&s;ine&s;s. But as Matters have been managed by the <HI>Reviewers,</HI> it is manife&s;t that the whole is a mere Job, eternally &s;welled out with dull Extracts from dull Authors, calculated to &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of a few Publi&s;hers, and to mi&s;guide the Public Ta&s;te. The frequent Abu&s;es of the Liturgy, the Arguments for abo|li&s;hing the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Creed, and the &s;candalous Treat|ment of many Clergymen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are &s;trong Indications of the Hand of a Fanatic; and the idle Strictures of natural Hi&s;tory, Fo&s;&s;ils, Minerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are infallible Marks of a certain exploded Herbali&s;t, who has reduced him&s;elf to the lamentable Situation de|&s;cribed by a great Genius, when he &s;ays there is not a more mi&s;erable Figure than a Man who has wrote him&s;elf down. It is therefore &s;ubmitted to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, whether it is not the highe&s;t Pre&s;umption in a Set of Hirelings to impo&s;e on the Judgment of their unfortunate Readers by a gro&s;s Mi&s;repre&s;entation of all Compo&s;itions, according as they are directed by a Spirit of Malevolence or Partiality; to u&s;urp the Seat of Cri|tici&s;m without declaring who and what they are, without producing their Credentials, to &s;hew the World by what Authority they act, and without previou&s;ly giving un|deniable Proofs of their own Ability and Ta&s;te, according to the Statute of Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>

Whereupon the Council again&s;t the Pro&s;ecu|tion, declared, they had nothing further to offer in Fa|vour of their Clients, and the Judge proceeded to give his Charge to the Jury, declaring the <HI>Monthly Review</HI> to be an In&s;ult on the Under&s;tandings of all the good Peo|ple of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> calculated to &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of Book&s;ellers, and gratify the Re&s;entment of <HI>bad Au|thors,</HI> who, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob&s;erves, are generally <HI>bad Men.</HI></P>
<P>He declared the arbitrary Proceeding of the Pri|&s;oners at the Bar to be very like the Declaration of a Per&s;onage in <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Play, called <HI>Les Femmes Scavantes,</HI> who &s;ays, very plea&s;antly, <Q>By our own Laws we will be the &s;ole Judges of Compo&s;ition; by our Laws every Thing in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e &s;hall be &s;ub|mitted to us; no one &s;hall be allowed Wit, except our&s;elves and our Friends; we will make it our Bu&s;ine&s;s to find fault and detract, till at length we &s;hall find our&s;elves the only People capable of fine Writing.</Q>

<P>_THERE is not a more favourite, or a more trite Subject, of Declamation, than the Degeneracy of the Times. Each Indivi|dual of Society, charitably judging him&s;elf excepted from the general Reproach, a&s;&s;umes a Privi|lege to inveigh again&s;t the Vices of the Age, and the total Decline from tho&s;e Virtues, which immortalized the exalted Characters of Antiquity, and enabled the Ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Race of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to deliver down to Po&s;terity a Con&s;titution, which &s;till renders them the Envy of the World.</P>
<P>This &s;plenetic Humour of decrying the Moderns, is become &s;o univer&s;al, that all Ranks and Orders of Men, &s;eem more or le&s;s infected by it. The Divine patheti|cally bewails the &s;hameful Neglect of Religion. The Patriot laments, that Venality and Corruption have irretrievably extingui&s;hed the genuine Spirit of Liberty. The Philo&s;opher &s;ighs, that Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Super&s;ti|tion &s;hould have u&s;urped the Throne of free Enquiry, and deba&s;ed the intellectual Faculties The Fair com|plain, that the di&s;&s;olute Inclinations of the Men compel them to drag out an uncomfortable Life in Celibacy; while the Men, in their Turn, pour out the mo&s;t bitter Invectives again&s;t the Extravagance and Di&s;&s;ipation of the other Sex, which, they would have the World be|lieve, are ri&s;en to &s;uch an Exce&s;s, that the Word Ma|trimony
<PB N="304" REF="307">carries with it the Idea of Bankruptcy and Ruin. Nay &s;o far has the Influence of this Infatuation reached, that it is become very common for even Stock|jobbers to a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that Things are not now, as they have been&mdash;nothing is to be done now&mdash;the Prokerage in and out runs away with all the Profit; whereas, in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, when the Govern|ment was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for Money, and nece&s;&s;itated to give &s;ix <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon a Loan, great Strokes were to be made.</Q></P>
<P>In order, therefore, to &s;hew the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s, as well as Di&s;ingenuity, of this epidemic Di&s;&s;atisfaction with the Age, in which I had the Happine&s;s to be born, I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate, and, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall be able to do it, beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of Doubt, that the now exining Inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;o far from being inferior to their illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;ors, do at this Day &s;urpa&s;s the Ancients in all the admired Virtues and Qualifications, which the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic Idolizer of Antiquity &s;hall be able to point out.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, <HI>Socrates, Plato, Cicero,</HI> and &s;ome few others of remote Antiquity, are frequently cele|brated for that amazing Strength of Mind, which enabled them to detect the Impo&s;tures of the Religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Country where they were born, and empowered them to break through the Impediments, which Super&s;tition and Prie&s;tcra&s;t had placed in the Avenues to Truth. But &s;urely the in&s;ignificant Number of In&s;tances, that ancient Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes, of tho&s;e truly-philo&s;ophic Characters, however, re&s;pectable the Names may be, will little de&s;erve our Attention, when we con&s;ider how infinitely the pre&s;ent Age eclip&s;es their Claim of Superiority, in this Re&s;pect. Is there a Gentleman at this Day, any Way conver&s;ant in polite Life, who does not entertain the greate&s;t Contempt for the Prejudices, or Faith (as it is vulgarly called.) in which he was educated? Are not the Coffee-hou&s;es
<PB N="305" REF="308">about <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> nay, even in the City, &s;o many Seminaries, where our Youth di&s;cu&s;s the mo&s;t important Que&s;tions of Philo&s;ophy, and explode the Errors im|po&s;ed on Mankind for &s;o many Centuries? Nor is this Knowledge, as among the Ancients, the Re&s;ult of te|dious Enquiry and Meditation, but entirely intuitive, being mo&s;t eminent in tho&s;e, who are almo&s;t totally void of the lea&s;t Acqui&s;ition in any Branch of Litera|ture, and indebted to Nature alone for their a&s;toni&s;hing Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>The Advocate for Antiquity will, perhaps, thunder out an Eulogium on the exalted Virtue and Patrioti&s;m of <HI>Cato, Brutus,</HI> and &s;everal other illu&s;trious <HI>Romans,</HI> who, prodigal of Life, di&s;dained to &s;urvive the Liber|ties of their Country. But certainly there can be no room to run a Parallel, the Advantage is &s;o obviou&s;ly on the Side of the Moderns. Tho&s;e ingenious Hi&s;to|rians, the Daily News-Writers, in every Page of their Works afford us Examples of the noble&s;t Di&s;regard of Death. The <HI>Roman</HI> voluntarily quits the World, be|cau&s;e he could not bear to be a Witne&s;s of the Slavery of his Country; but, the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> puts a Period to his Exi&s;tence, becau&s;e the Fogs of <HI>November</HI> depre&s;s his Spirits, and he &s;corns to be compelled to live longer, than Life continues agreeable. How noble is this Spirit of Freedom! which is not confined to People of Birth and Education, but extends it&s;elf to the lowe&s;t Mechanics, in&s;omuch, that my Lord is not more ready to di&s;charge a Pi&s;tol through his Brain, than his Barber. In &s;hort, the Point is &s;o extremely clear, that it would be quite &s;uperfluous to labour at the Proof of it, and I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that no Nation, of which Hi|&s;tory has pre&s;erved the lea&s;t Record, has any Preten|&s;ion, to di&s;pute the Glory of Suicide with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware, that great Stre&s;s may be laid upon the literary Merit of the Ancients, and expect to hear the Names of <HI>Ari&s;totle, Longinus</HI> and <HI>Quintilian</HI> thrown
<PB N="306" REF="309">out, with an exulting Air of Triumph. Far be it from me, to attempt to derogate from the long e&s;tabli&s;hed Fame of tho&s;e great Men. Undoubtedly, they were very good Critics for the Times, in which they lived; but with all due Re&s;pect to tho&s;e celebrated Geniu&s;&s;es, we may take the Liberty to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Art of Critici&s;m mu&s;t be now much better under&s;tood, than it po&s;&s;ibly could be in their Days, as it is much more uni|ver&s;ally &s;tudied. Attorneys Clerks, Mercers 'Appren|tices, and Merchants Book-keepers in this Year 1754, <HI>credite po&s;teri</HI> are thoroughly qualified to pronounce, in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive Manner, upon the Merit of all literary Compo&s;itions, particularly dramatic Poetry, the noble&s;t Province of polite Learning; not to mention, that we have found out the Ab&s;urdity, and &s;hook off the re|&s;traint, of tho&s;e Fetters, which the Stagyrite would rivet on us, and transferred them to our Gallic Neigh|bours, a Nation inured to, and patient of, Slavery.</P>
<P>Should any di&s;contented, or di&s;appointed Politician, after poring over <HI>Livy,</HI> in&s;inuate, that Mankind are not now, as they were in the Times of the <HI>Roman</HI> Re|public, when private Con&s;iderations always gave Way to the publick Good, I would only de&s;ire &s;uch a phleg|matic Murmurer to look through the Kingdom, and ob|&s;erve what a Number of Gentlemen have impaired their E&s;tates, and de&s;troyed the Tranquillity and Happine&s;s of their Families, in order to procure a Seat in the Re|pre&s;entative-A&s;&s;embly of the Nation: undoubtedly with no other View, but that they might be watchful over the Liberties of their Country.</P>
<P>Some mercantile Cynic, di&s;&s;atisfied with an unruly Son, who finds more Charms within the Regions of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> than the Counting-Hou&s;e, will perhaps pay little Regard to what I have hitherto advanced, and exclaim, <Q>that the Spirit of Indu&s;try is quite lo&s;t, and People of this Age regard nothing but Plea&s;ure.</Q>&mdash; But the Injudice of this Cen&s;ure would evidently appear
<PB N="307" REF="310">to this narrow-minded Citizen, if, the next Time he went to the Pit at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> with his Wife and Daugh|ters on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> he would take the Trouble to make Enquiry, concerning the mo&s;t gay and brilliant Per|&s;onages in the Boxes. He could then be informed, that they are Gentlemen, by Way of Eminence, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the Appellation of <HI>Knights of Indu&s;try,</HI> who, without any vi&s;ible Means of Sub&s;i&s;tence, enjoy all the Plea&s;ures of this Metropolis, in the mo&s;t elegant Man|ner, and run into Expences, which few Men of <HI>real</HI> Fortune can &s;upport.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our View to the amiable Sex, and enter into a Compari&s;on between the Females of an|cient Times and the pre&s;ent Ladies of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In what an honourable Light will our Country-Women appear? In vain &s;hall the Pedant, who derives his Knowledge &s;olely from Books, harangue upon the con|jugal Attachment of <HI>Roman</HI> Matrons, while we can mention numberle&s;s <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Wives, who, at this Day, with unexampled Unanimity, go Hand in Hand with their Hu&s;bands, in pur&s;uit of the grand Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life; mean GAMING; which Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his u&s;ual emphatic Manner, calls <HI>the Nation's la&s;t great Trade.</HI> Nor &s;hould the Candor and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of the Vir|gins of this I&s;land want that Encomium, which Ju&s;tice cannot refu&s;e. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in&s;orms us, that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or|dered the <HI>Spartan</HI> Nymphs to appear at the public Exerci&s;es, in Garments, made with artificial Openings, in different Parts, in order that the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Youth might be captivated, by a &s;eemingly accidental Di&s;co|very of their Charms. But our Fair ones, di&s;daining &s;o di&s;ingenuous a Proceeding, and &s;corning to take Advantage of the Illu&s;ion of Imagination, which, in|flamed by a tran&s;ient Glymp&s;e, is apt to form enthu|&s;ia&s;tic Ideas of hidden Beauty, <HI>&s;hew Things as they really are,</HI> and by making a generous Di&s;play of all their Charms, leave no room to their future Hu&s;bands, to
<PB N="308" REF="311">complain, that they were deceived in their Expecta|tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Examples, which I have brought in &s;upport of the Propo&s;ition, I undertook to prove, will &s;ufficiently evince to every impartial Mind, that the pretended Pre|eminence of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> over <HI>Britain,</HI> has no other Foundation, than Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Envy; and all un|prejudiced Readers mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in the Truth of the Ob&s;ervation, made, with great In&s;ight into human Na|ture, by the elegant Hi&s;torian, from whom I have taken the Motto of this Paper&mdash;<HI>We are naturally more ready to do Ju&s;tice to what we hear of than to what we &s;ee; cotemporary Merit excites our Envy, but that of an|cient Times our Veneration: We do not think cur&s;elves eclip&s;ed by the latter, but con&s;ider the former as a re|proachful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ion to us.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Cannot but very much approve that Spirit of Patrioti&s;m, which &s;eems to have in&s;pired the E&s;&s;ay of la&s;t <HI>Saturday.</HI> The Generality of Mankind are &s;lavi&s;hly attached to e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Prejudices, and it mu&s;t be a &s;trong and manly Genius, that will dare to examine received Opinions, and boldly a&s;&s;ert the Truth again&s;t popular Sentiments and vulgar Error. This, Mr. <HI>Ranger,</HI> you have per|formed very eminently in your la&s;t Paper; and as I en|tirely coincide with your Way of thinking, I beg Leave to addre&s;s this Letter to you, as a Supplement to what you have there advanced.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t avow that I entirely agree with you, that the Moderns have in every thing greatly exceeded the ad|mired Ancients. If the latter boa&s;t their <HI>Plato,</HI> we have our Lord <HI>Shaft&s;bury;</HI> and if the Death of <HI>Cato</HI> is ju&s;tly &s;tiled by the Poet, <HI>Catonis nobile Letum,</HI> becau&s;e he would not &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of Liberty, is it not much more heroic in a modern Cobler to di&s;patch him&s;elf, for on other Rea&s;on but that he does not like the Weather, or in a Nobleman to cut his Throat, becau&s;e he has lo&s;t the odd Trick at Whi&s;t? In addition to this, it mu&s;t be con|&s;idered that few In&s;tances of this Sort of Fortitude are ecorded among the <HI>Romans;</HI> whereas I am credibly in|formed
<PB N="311" REF="314">by a very &s;en&s;ible Man, and one of the <HI>Coroner</HI>'s <HI>Inque&s;t,</HI> that there does not pa&s;s by a &s;ingle Day, without his being called to Turvey the glorious Reliques of a &s;elf-devoted Taylor, Shoemaker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame Per&s;on a&s;&s;ures me at the &s;ame Time, that not a tenth Part of tho&s;e exalted Minds have the due Honours paid to their Memory by the public News papers, but are permitted to remove them&s;elves from human Life in the &s;ame Si|lence, as if they had quietly pa&s;s'd through Nature to Eternity, and never dared to fly in the Face of their Maker. But to &s;et this Matter in the cleare&s;t Point of View, I &s;hall here draw up a Catalogue of whatever may &s;eem to give the Ancients a Claim to our Preference, contra&s;ted with a Li&s;t of modern Improvements, upon a fair In&s;pection of which, I flatter my&s;elf, the Laurel, will by every impartial Reader be adjudged to the pre&s;ent Age.</P>

As for in&s;tance, I do not find that they had an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> among them; and &s;urely the Character of an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> mu&s;t in the Eyes of all Men of Sen&s;e, do very great Honour to the pre&s;ent Age, the Tenets of his Phi|lo&s;ophy being entirely new, and &s;uch as were not di&s;co|ver'd by <HI>Plato, Tully, Socrates,</HI> or any of the ancient Philo|&s;ophers: That happy Di&s;covery being re&s;erved for the pre|&s;ent Age, &s;o much enlightened, as a great Genius &s;ays, in all true Philo&s;ophy. Add to this, what has been al|ready urged on a &s;imilar Occa&s;ion, the Ancients were totally ignorant of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and, I believe, it cannot be denied, but the common Law of <HI>England</HI> is by many Degrees preferable to the Laws of <HI>Solon,</HI> or any other Legi&s;lator, as it is founded upon the &s;ure Ba&s;is of common Sen&s;e, intelligible to the meane&s;t Capacity, without much Study, and full as ea&s;y in the Practice as in the Theory. I mu&s;t acknowledge that I have read in <HI>Livy</HI> and <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> &s;ome random Accounts of the Contempt the Candidates had in <HI>Rome</HI> for Money upon all Elections for the Con&s;ul&s;hip, the Tribune&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Proce|dure among them was &s;tiled by the ill-natured by the Name of <HI>Ambitus,</HI> and by the rigid among the Moderns Bribery and Corruption; but, to dive&s;t Things of odi|ous Appellations, the public and benevolent Spirit of our Countrymen at a general Election cannot be parallelled any where in the <HI>Roman</HI> Page. The Ancients occa&s;i|onally
<PB N="313" REF="316">make a Murmur concerning a Matter which they call <HI>nequi&s;&s;ima faenora,</HI> but it will need no Force of Argu|ment to prove, that U&s;ury has attained to a greater De|gree of Profu&s;ion among the Moderns. How many young Heirs are ruined with us before they come to Years of Di&s;cretion? Not to mention that they had not the fainte&s;t Idea of the <HI>Stocks, Jonathan</HI>'s Coffee-Hou&s;e, <HI>Change Alley,</HI> the <HI>South-Sea-Hou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>India-Hou&s;e, Re&s;|counters, Directors, Brokers, &amp;c.</HI> That the <HI>Romans</HI> were a very expon&s;ive People, is very well known to Mr. <HI>Ran|ger,</HI> and every one who has dipped into <HI>Vertot</HI>'s Revolu|tions, or the famous <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI>'s Cau&s;es of the Declen|&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; notwith&s;tanding this, I have the Plea&s;ure to congratulate my Countrymen on our owing &s;o many Millions of Money; and I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, every one of my Readers will allow, that the na|tional Debt gives us a very great Advantage over the Ancients. I am not ignorant that <HI>Sallu&s;t</HI> mentions <HI>pub|lic&egrave; Ege&s;tatem, privatim Opulentiam, public Penury</HI> and <HI>private Opulence.</HI> But, Sir, I appeal to you whether we have not both the&s;e more glaringly than appears any where in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory. Tho' I &s;hould be &s;orry to be guided by a national Partiality in this Matter, yet I cannot but think our <HI>national Debt</HI> is as remarkable a Thing as I ever read of in Hi&s;tory; and as to private Wealth the infinite Sums of Money laid out in arti|ficial Falls of Water, artificial Canals, and indeed in artificial Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mo&s;t evidently evince our Superio|rity. Moreover, I apprehend, the Ancients were en|tire Strangers to Routs and Drums; not to mention two or three Hundred Card-Tables in one Hou&s;e. I do not think that they &s;eem to have the fainte&s;t Idea of an E. O. Table, of <HI>rever&s;ing,</HI> of <HI>forcing,</HI> of <HI>fine&s;&s;ing,</HI> of <HI>&s;ee&s;awing,</HI> and the many elegant Turns in the Game of Whi&s;t. <HI>Picquet, Brag, Backgammon, Cribbidge,</HI> are not even mentioned in the &s;lighte&s;t manner, and, I flatter my|&s;elf I may &s;ay, without the Danger of a Controver&s;y, that
<PB N="314" REF="317">the Di&s;coveries made by Mr. <HI>Hoyle</HI> in the Doctrine of <HI>Chances,</HI> by far exceed their deepe&s;t Re&s;earches in the Mathematicks.</P>
<P>To give the Argument another turn; the Beauty, the Elegance and Manners of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies give a &s;ur|prizing Lu&s;tre to the pre&s;ent Age. <HI>Horace</HI> informs us,
<Q><L><HI>Matronae praeter faciem nil cernere po&s;&s;is,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Caetera, ni Catia e&s;t, demi&s;&s;&acirc; ve&s;te tegentis.</HI></L></Q> A Matron never &s;hews any Part of her Per&s;on except her Face, they being all &s;tudious, unle&s;s it be <HI>Catia,</HI> to cover the re&s;t of their amiable bodies with a Garment. <HI>Catia</HI> it &s;eems then is a &s;ingular In&s;tance; but how different is the Conduct of the Matrons of the modern Times? They have all happily emerged from the Ruff of Queen <HI>Be&s;s,</HI> and their chief Endeavour is to di&s;play all their Charms to full View. Had this Fa&s;hion prevailed a|mong the ancient Ladies, I conceive, a <HI>naked Venus</HI> would not have been &s;o great a Rarity. Indeed in <HI>Eng|land</HI> &s;ome Remains of this fal&s;e Mode&s;ty prevailed not very long &s;ince, in con&s;equence of which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has finely &s;aid,
<Q><L><HI>If</HI> Queen&s;bury <HI>to &s;trip there's no compelling,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis from a Handmaid we mu&s;t take an</HI> Helen.</L></Q> But happily future Painters will not be reduced to &s;uch Difficulties, as the modern Ladies are daily &s;tripping as fa&s;t as they can, and the vi&s;ible Approaches of the amia|ble Sex to a general Nakedne&s;s cannot fail to give a Lu&s;tre to my fair Countrywomen beyond all <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Fame. The Tendency to undre&s;&s;ing is &s;o &s;trong at pre&s;ent, that I make no doubt but the Time will come in a Period not far di&s;tant, when Mi&s;s in her Teens will cry out, <Q>Lard, Mamma, I have been reading the <HI>World</HI> or the <HI>Gray's-Inn Journal,</HI> but they are &s;o full of hard cramp Words, I can't think what to make of 'em&mdash;Pray, Mamma, what can they mean by Stays?</Q> <Q>&mdash;Really Child, &s;ays Mamma, I can't &s;ay for certain,
<PB N="315" REF="318">but if one may conjecture, I &s;hould imagine, that in tho&s;e Days the Women wore &s;omething about their Bo|dies as high from the Wai&s;t up as the Pit of their Sto|mach</Q>.&mdash;<Q>He! he! he! Mamma what a ridiculous Fa&s;hion that mu&s;t be! What has a Woman a fine Skin for but to &s;hew it? or if &s;he has not a fine Skin, what has &s;he Paint for but to make a fine Skin? And then Mamma, what could the Petticoat be?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Why Child, it looks as if in tho&s;e Days they wore a Cover|ing for their Limbs down from the Wai&s;t as low as the Ankle.</Q>&mdash;<Q>He! he! he! &s;ays Mi&s;s, what has a Woman Legs for but to &s;hew 'em? And then Mamma, I &s;up|po&s;e by Crown-whi&s;t that the People in tho&s;e Days were &s;o penurious, and &s;o pitiful, and &s;o careful as only to play for Crowns?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, Child, &s;ays Mamma, that is pretty plain, and keeping <HI>Sundays</HI> was then made a Crime, and three Hundred Card-Tables was then counted a Thing of Con&s;equence</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, Mam|ma, I am as glad as any thing I was not born in tho&s;e grave, formal Times.</Q></P>
<P>This, or &s;omething not unlike it, will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be the Language of the ri&s;ing Generation, and if Improve|ments are made in other Branches, &s;uch as the <HI>national Debt, Athei&s;m, &amp;c.</HI> I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that whatever the Admirers of the Antients may urge at pre&s;ent, our Superiority will then be inconte&s;tible.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the Pro&s;pect of this happy Period, I will here lay down my Pen, and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf Mr. <HI>Ranger</HI>'s</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Lau&s;us Equum domitor.
<BIBL><HI>VIRG.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is ob&s;erved by <HI>Horace,</HI> that in a long Work an Author may very lawfully indulge him|&s;elf with a Nap; on this Account I &s;hall make no Apology for having been occa|&s;ionally caught nodding; on the contrary, I &s;hall make an Account of the various Occurrences, I lately met with in my Sleep, the Subject of this Day's Paper.</P>
<P>I dreamt, that, being on board a Merchantman, upon a Voyage, which indi&s;pen&s;ible Bu&s;ine&s;s obliged me to make, we were drove by Di&s;tre&s;s of Weather far to the Southward in the <HI>Great Pacific</HI> Ocean, and that, in the Night-Time, we were &s;uddenly thrown on the Shore of an I&s;land totally unknown to the Ship's Crew. While
<PB N="318" REF="321">they were, next Morning, all Hands at Work to get off the Ship, I adventured farther up into the Country, and had not journeyed far, when I perceived my&s;elf to be in the Land of the <HI>Houyhnhnms,</HI> mentioned by Capt. <HI>Gul|liver,</HI> in his Travels, and in a little Time me|thought I met with the &s;ame Ma&s;ter <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> with whom that accurate Traveller &s;o long conver&s;ed. As he had before &s;een one of my Species I was freed from the di&s;agreeable Circum&s;tances of being &s;tared at, and &s;hew|ed about, in the Manner we do a tall Man or a &s;hort Woman in <HI>England.</HI> The Ma&s;ter <HI>Houynhnhnm</HI> immedi|ately took me into a private Apartment, and began to que&s;tion me concerning the State of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular. He a&s;ked me whether the &s;ame Vices were &s;till in fa&s;hion among us, and more e&s;pecially whether that Li&s;t of Enormities, which <HI>Gul|liver</HI> had mentioned to him were &s;till continued in Prac|tice; &s;uch as <HI>Robbing, Stealing, Cheating, Pimping, For|&s;wearing, Flattering, Suborning, Forging, Gaming, Lying, Fauning, Hectoring, Voting, Scribbling, Star-gazing, Poi|&s;oning, Whoreing, Canting, Libelling, Freethinking,</HI> and the like. I told him they flouri&s;hed with as much, if not more Vigour, than ever, and that two of them, <HI>viz. Gaming</HI> and <HI>Libelling</HI> encrea&s;ed and gathered Strength every Day; that there are &s;everal in the Metropolis of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> who profe&s;&s;edly live by them; that in order to carry on the former, <HI>viz.</HI> Gaming, with Ala|crity, there are &s;everal Societies formed, where they meet with a De&s;ign upon one another's Pockets, which was introductory of another Crime, not mentioned by <HI>Gulliver,</HI> viz. <HI>Suicide;</HI> this I took &s;ome Pains to ex|plain, and then he fetched a deep Groan at the Pride and Arrogance of human Nature. I added, that the <HI>Female Yahoos</HI> among&s;t us were all turned ab&s;olute Game&s;ters, and kept Routs, Drums, Hurricanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Purpo&s;es of Play. I remember I had a very &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure in calling the fair Game&s;ters by the
<PB N="319" REF="322">Name of <HI>Female Yahoos,</HI> becau&s;e I really think that Term very aptly appropriated to them, when they re|linqui&s;h their native Delicacy, and become a Prey to all the tormenting Pa&s;&s;ions of Gaming. I further informed the Ma&s;ter <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> that Libelling is now in greater Vogue than ever, and that a Society was formed for that Purpo&s;e by a Set of Scribblers, who call them&s;elves <HI>Critical and Monthly Reviewers,</HI> and from their ob&s;cure Haunts attack the Reputation of every Man; whom they di&s;like for no Motive, except that &s;trong Antipathy which Dullne&s;s and Malice always have to Genius and a fair Fame. The worthy <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> here fetched a &s;econd Groan, hurt by a Reflection on the Ba&s;ene&s;s of human Nature: He then enquired about his former Ac|quaintance, Capt. <HI>Gulliver,</HI> and &s;aid he looked upon him to be exempt from all the mean fordid Vices of his Species. Whereupon I informed him, that <HI>Gulliver</HI> was only that celebrated Per&s;on's travelling Name; that in <HI>Europe</HI> he was known by the immortal Name of Doctor <HI>Swift;</HI> as I am particularly fond of the Writings of that great Genius, and never travel without them, I informed the <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> that I had his Works in my Che&s;t, and if he would per|mit me to return to the Ship, I would have the Honour of pre&s;enting them to him. This Propo&s;al was per|fectly agreeable, and in a little Space of Time I came back with that elegant Edition of <HI>Swift</HI>'s Works lately publi&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>Hawk&s;worth.</HI> In a few Days he read over the be&s;t Part of his Works, and was delighted with mo&s;t of them, but more particularly with the faithful Account of the Conver&s;ation he formerly had with him, which, he &s;aid, was &s;et down without the lea&s;t Devia|tion from Truth. He added, that the Account prefixed by Mr. <HI>Hawk&s;worth,</HI> of the Author's Life was an ad|mirable Compo&s;ition. <Q>I ob&s;erve, &s;aid he, that my old Acquaintance <HI>Gulliver,</HI> or <HI>Swift,</HI> was at once an In&s;tance of the Dignity and the Imbecillity of human Nature; and the Writer of his Life, I am per&s;uaded,
<PB N="320" REF="323">mu&s;t have both a clear Head and a good Heart, be|cau&s;e his Stile is properly conci&s;e, and always clear, &s;trong and harmonious, and it is with a very percepti|ble Regret that he &s;peaks of the Infirmities of his Au|thor; he &s;eems tenderly to fling them into Shades, to &s;often away every thing unamiable, and to place his good Qualities in the mo&s;t glaring Light.</Q> Finding the worthy <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> to be very much plea&s;ed with this Performance of Mr. <HI>Hawk&s;worth,</HI> I made him a Pre&s;ent of the <HI>Adventurer</HI> in four Volumes, which he received with a &s;eeming Avidity, and chancing to light upon the Ea&s;tern Story of <HI>Carazan,</HI> the <HI>Merchant of Bagdat,</HI> he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf delighted with the Moral which it in|culcates, and amazed at his Warmth and Sublimity of Imagination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> ob&s;erved, when I pre&s;ented the above Books to him, that I dropt a Paper, and in &s;ome Con|fu&s;ion ha&s;tily &s;natched it up. This Paper was no other than Mr. <HI>Pons</HI>'s Li&s;t of the Hor&s;es that run at <HI>New-mar|ket,</HI> which I was de&s;irous to conceal from him, but be|ing urged to &s;how it, he laughed at the Whim&s;icalne&s;s of the Conceit, as he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be, and he wondered Mr. <HI>Pons</HI> would &s;ay the Thing which was not. I a&s;&s;ur'd him of the Veracity of the Account, and told him, however, incredible it might appear, that <HI>Jockeys</HI> rid Hor&s;es, or <HI>Houyhnhnms,</HI> at full &s;peed for Wagers in many other Places in <HI>England,</HI> and that even the fir&s;t Noble|men would frequently ride their own Hor&s;es, and appear at a great Meeting no better than <HI>Jockeys</HI> and <HI>Grooms.</HI> To convince him further of the great Perfection we have attained in the Management of Hor&s;es, I produced to him <HI>A New Sy&s;tem of Hor&s;eman&s;hip from the</HI> French <HI>of Mon&s;ieur</HI> Bourgela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>By</HI> Richard Berenger, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> He at fir&s;t laughed at the Impracticability of the Scheme, but upon my a&s;&s;ur|ing him, that the whole was &s;ounded on the ju&s;te&s;t Ob|&s;ervation, he immediately &s;ent for another <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> and ordered me to mount him, in order to &s;hew him the
<PB N="321" REF="324">Efficacy of the Rules. In vain I endeavoured to decline it by Apologies for my own Want of Dexterity; to en|courage me he bid the <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> not do me a Mi&s;chief, and I was obliged to vault into the Saddle, where I fixed my&s;elf upon the <HI>Twi&s;t, with a proper Gra&s;p or Hold,</HI> and <HI>that too without employing any Strength, but tru&s;ting entirely to the Balance of my Body. I employed a quick and feeling Hand,</HI> and then made him advance, go back, turn to the right and le&s;t according to my own Will and Plea&s;ure. The Ma&s;ter <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> was &s;urprized to &s;ee me have &s;o ab&s;olute a Command; the <HI>Volte,</HI> the <HI>Demivolte,</HI> the <HI>Gallop,</HI> the &s;everal <HI>Pa&s;&s;ades,</HI> the <HI>Terre-a-Terre,</HI> the <HI>Mezair,</HI> the <HI>Curvet, &amp;c.</HI> were Matters of A&s;toni&s;h|ment to him, and when I alighted the <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> which I rode, declared that &s;everal Times, his Pride being picqued, he attempted to fling me, but that by a quick Turn of the Wri&s;t, he found his Power totally taken away from him. The Ma&s;ter again carried me into his Apart|ment, and after expre&s;&s;ing a due Degree of A&s;toni&s;h|ment, <Q>Surely, &s;aid he, the Per&s;on who can thus, in &s;o elegant and per&s;picuous a Manner, put together a Sy&s;tem of Rules for &s;ubduing the noble Race of <HI>Houy|hnhnms,</HI> mu&s;t make great Attainments, whenever he turns his Thoughts to other Matters.</Q> I an&s;wered, that his Conjecture was perfectly ju&s;t; that the Author had publi&s;hed that Performance becau&s;e Riding is his fa|vourite Excerci&s;e, and that it is to be hoped he will &s;ome Day handle other Topics, with that Ta&s;te and De|licacy with which this Compo&s;ition &s;hews he can treat ordinary Things.&mdash;<Q>No Doubt, &s;ays the <HI>Huyhnhnm,</HI> when he thus touches on what it &s;eems in <HI>England,</HI> is but the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, but he mu&s;t di&s;play great Elegance, when he di&s;cu&s;&s;es Matters of more Re|finement. I own I &s;hould be glad to conver&s;e with him, tho' I con&s;ider him as a kind of Enemy, and I hope he is a &s;eafaring Man, that I may have &s;ome Chance of &s;eeing him here one time or other.</Q> Up|on
<PB N="322" REF="325">hearing the Author was de&s;igned by Birth, Genius, and Education to &s;hine in another Sphere, he de|clar'd him&s;elf &s;orry, and in Compliance with my Re|que&s;t, gave me Leave to return to the Ship, which was by this Time got off the Shore. I therefore ki&s;&s;ed his Hoof, which he rai&s;ed for me, as he formerly did to <HI>Gulliver,</HI> and after de&s;iring his Compliments to the Edi|tor of <HI>Swift</HI>'s <HI>Works,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Sy&s;tem of Hor&s;eman&s;hip,</HI> he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with a &s;erious Admonition to avoid the Meanne&s;&s;es and the &s;everal fordid Vices of hu|man Nature. Whereupon I took my final Leave, and re|turned to my Companions. We &s;ailed with a pro&s;perous Wind, and, meeting but few Accidents in our Voyage, in a &s;hort Time, arrived at <HI>Grave&s;end.</HI> My Joy at finding my&s;elf once more in <HI>Old England</HI> was &s;o great, that I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the Language of the Country I came from, and awakened out of my Sleep crying out HOUYHNHNM.</P>

<PB N="323" REF="326">Time in his <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal</HI> made too free with Cha|racters which had not offended him, to the great Unea|&s;ine&s;s of the Per&s;ons &s;o attacked, and again&s;t the Statute recorded by <HI>Horace, Sublato jure nocendi, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ranger</HI> objected to &s;everal who were &s;ummoned to be on the Jury, offering various Rea&s;ons as Occa&s;ion requir|ed, &s;uch as <HI>Dulne&s;s, Ignorance, Prejudice, &amp;c.</HI> At length this Point being adju&s;ted, the Cau&s;e was opened by Coun&s;ellor <HI>Fe&s;ter,</HI> who &s;pared neither Elocution nor Elo|quence to inflame the Mind of the Court, and the Gen|tlemen impanelled again&s;t the Pri&s;oner at the Bar. Ma|ny In&s;tances, he in&s;i&s;ted, could be pointed out of per&s;onal Re&s;entment, and Malice prepen&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After which, &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Writings were read in Court, and &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es appeared to enforce the Charge exhibited again&s;t him.&mdash;Among the&s;e were <HI>Quinbus Fle&s;trin,</HI> from the <HI>Bedford</HI> Coffee Hou&s;e; <HI>Bob Nankeen, Nat Pigtail, Harry Lappel, Jack Oak&s;tick, Jem|my Scratch,</HI> from the City; Mr. <HI>Mac Gregor,</HI> Mr. <HI>Broad|brim,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shallow, &amp;c.</HI> from the Robinhood Society; Mon&s;. <HI>Bourguignon,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Languedoc,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Bernard;</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Soup meagre; &amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Tom</HI>'s in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s in <HI>St. Martin</HI>'s <HI>Lane; Mo&s;es Aminadab, Selim Levi, Rubens Shylock,</HI> &amp;c. from <HI>Dukes-Place;</HI> and &s;ome others from various Parts of the Town; all the&s;e de|po&s;ed, that the Pri&s;oner had indulged him&s;elf in frequent Strokes of Plea&s;antry upon them, and they therefore hoped the Jury would bring in a Verdict accordingly.</P>
<SP>
<STAGE>Pri&s;oner's Defence.</STAGE>
<P><HI>May it plea&s;e this honourable Court, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</HI></P>
<P>The Imputation of wantonly making free with Characters that had not given any per&s;onal Offence, is a Point I mu&s;t &s;peak a few Words to, be|cau&s;e I think it a very fallacious Argument, and
<PB N="324" REF="327">if it be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry any Weight, it may be &s;uffici|ent to tie up the Hands of every Satyri&s;t. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that a ridiculous Character &s;hould tread upon an Author's Toe, or offend him in &s;ome other Manner; without that, he is free Game for every Sport&s;man of the Qui'l; and that this is Mr. POPE'S Opinion appears from the following Lines;
<Q><L><HI>And mu&s;t no Egg in</HI> Japhet'<HI>s Face be thrown,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Becau&s;e the Deed he forg'd was not my own?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther declare before this honourable Court, that I never &s;aw one of the&s;e Gentlemen, who have appeared again&s;t me, in my Life.&mdash;Their Faces, their Per&s;ons, their Characters, are to me perfectly unknown: and therefore I pre&s;ume, it may be fairly inferred, that I never meant to give the lea&s;t Annoyance to any one in particular&mdash;They were all Per&s;onages of my own Creati|on, and &s;omething like them I imagined might exi&s;t in Nature, and therefore I fan&s;ied I had a Right to la&s;h or banter any Vice or Folly under imaginary Names, with|out intending a per&s;onal Application in any one In&s;tance. Having &s;aid thus much, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary in &s;o plain a Cafe to take up the Time of the Court, to who&s;e equitable Deci&s;ions I implicitly re&s;ign my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Jury withdrew, and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY, to the great Sa|tisfaction of <HI>Ranger</HI> and his Friends, and the Di&s;appoint|ment of the Group of Witne&s;&s;es mentioned above. The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court then broke his Staff, de|clared his Commi&s;&s;ion to be annulled, and the cen&s;orial Court was finally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>_A SPIRIT of Enterprize admini&s;ters to the Heart, in which its Pul&s;ations are felt, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t glowing Plea&s;ures our Con&s;titutions can admit; Doubts and Fears may ari&s;e, but they are &s;oon quenched by &s;anguine Hope; Succe&s;s hovers over the young Schemi&s;t's Head; Fame &s;tands in a Corner of the Picture, which fond Fancy has framed, blowing her immortal Trumpet, and Happine&s;s and gay Serenity dart in &s;prightly Vibrations through his Soul. Happy, were the golden dream ne|ver to evaporate! But Clouds ari&s;e that blot the intel|lectual Radiance, and as &s;oon as the Beams of Imagi|nation are dimini&s;hed, the Pa&s;&s;ions, like Flowers at the Setting Sun, immediately are contracted, the Spirits, that expanded every Nerve, &s;ink in their Channels, &s;ub|&s;ide into Languor, and Satiety takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mind. I remember, to have met with a Story of a prime Mini&s;ter to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who &s;eems to have had a &s;hrewd Turn of Humour. When the King happened, in the full Rapture of Expedition, and his Imagination dilated with Ideas of future Conque&s;t, to expatiate at large upon the various Incidents of his growing Enterprize: <Q>Pray Sir, (&s;ays he) what does all this tend to? Why, cries the Monarch, I &s;hall add the neighbouring Na|tions to my Dominions.&mdash;Well! and what then, pray? Why then I &s;hall declare War again&s;t the adjacent
<PB N="326" REF="329">States.&mdash;And what then, Sir? I &s;hall proceed in my Conque&s;ts, and the next Province &s;hall receive my Yoke.&mdash;And what then, Sir? Why their Neigh|bours &s;hall al&s;o pay Tribute &mdash; This is very well, my Liege, and what next?&mdash;Thus I &s;hall gradually ex|tend my Victories till I become Ma&s;ter of the Globe. &mdash;And what then?&mdash;Then&mdash;why,&mdash;then I'll &s;it down and crack a Bottle with my Friends&mdash; And pray, Sir, why not do &s;o now?</Q> This Pa&s;&s;age has always appeared to me to carry with it a very fine Stroke of Satyr, and I am inclinable to think, that if the greate&s;t Hero of Antiquity, were to make up the Account of his Happine&s;s, he would find it not one Jot more than is here implied.</P>
<P>But among all the various Adventurers who mu&s;t feel this Truth, there is no Set of <HI>Quixotes</HI> who experience it more powerfully than the Race of Authors. What Happine&s;s does not the periodical Writer enjoy in the fir&s;t dawning of a new Plan?&mdash;In Proportion as one Idea awakens a new Train of plea&s;ing Images, and the De&s;ign opens to his View, what Sen&s;ations unfelt be|fore? What Chearfulne&s;s, what Fancy, what luxuriant Wit? And when a Sheet, yet wet, is &s;ent him from the Pre&s;s for his In&s;pection, how his Heart bounds to &s;ee him&s;elf in print!&mdash;the Finene&s;s of the Paper!&mdash; How it plea&s;es him! The Elegance of the Type! &mdash;How its Symmetry &s;trikes the Eye! The Correct|ne&s;s of the Compo&s;itor!&mdash;How ju&s;t and how exact! &mdash;Flu&s;hed with the&s;e Ideas the Imagination expands it&s;elf, and in the Fulne&s;s of Self-Admiration, he ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the Words of <HI>Hamlet</HI>&mdash;"What a Piece of Work is Man! How noble in Rea&s;on! How infinite in Faculties!"&mdash;And yet pa&s;s but a few Hours, and how changed is every Trace of Reflection! The Critics gather round him, and, like the Harpies in the third <HI>Aeneid,</HI> they break in upon his Meal, and like them too, they denounce Penury and Famine. The
<PB N="327" REF="330">Learned meet his work by Chance; they &s;peak of it, but not with &s;ufficient Warmth, becau&s;e Men of Sen&s;e never admire, and only approve. He ther runs up and down among the Pamphlet Shops; in many they have not heard of it; he calls for it in Coffee-Hou&s;es, "Sir, we don't take it in"&mdash;In Places where it is u&s;ed, he &s;ees it twi&s;ted into a thou&s;and different Shapes, the Paper and Print neglected, and the Stile unregarded; the Waiters throw it among the common Lumber, and Gentlemen keep Snuff in it. The&s;e, and many other Indignities ari&s;e to mortify an Author's Pride; and be|&s;ides all this, the Novelty of the Performance will wear off with him, as well as his Readers, and even Fame, &s;uppo&s;ing the good natured World allow him his full Portion, will thrill by degrees with feebler Impul&s;e to his Heart-Strings, and in the Conclu&s;ion, I believe, he will find, that, Hero like, he cannot drink his Bottle with greater Plea&s;ure than when he fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>Add to this, that there is a Concurrence of Circum|&s;tances, which never &s;ail to render the Profe&s;&s;ion of an Author more unea&s;y than any other Station in Life.</P>
<P>The courtly <HI>Roman</HI> Satyri&s;t has attacked, with all the elegant Touches of his delicate Raillery, that prevailing Spirit of Unea&s;ine&s;s, which renders People di&s;contented with their own Situation in Life, and envious of the apparent Felicity of their Neighbours; but in the Lift of Male-Contents, which he has produced, I have of|ten wondered, that he has not thought proper to enrol the Race that write. The Occa&s;ion of this might po&s;|&s;ibly be, that Authors have more &s;olid Rea&s;ons than any other Cla&s;s of Beings, to repine and murmur at their Occupation, and to wi&s;h that Fate had a&s;&s;igned them an Employment, in which they might partake more of the Ea&s;e and the Enjoyments of Life.</P>
<P>And indeed, con&s;idering the great Di&s;proportion of Inten&s;ene&s;s between the Labours of the Mind, and tho&s;e of the Body, I do not know whether <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s Advice
<PB N="328" REF="331">to be an Auctioneer rather than a Poet, is not entirely eligible; for it is certain, that tho&s;e nice Faculties of Perception, of which the literary Enthu&s;ia&s;t is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as they are the Inlets of our mo&s;t refined intellectual Plea&s;ures, &s;o they are al&s;o, from the Quickne&s;s and De|licacy of their Feeling, &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t acute Degrees of Pain, and in the &s;ame Proportion that they admini&s;ter to Happine&s;s, they may al&s;o improve and &s;harpen the Edge of Mi&s;ery; in like Manner as the String, from which the &s;kilful Arti&s;t elicits a de|lightful Strain of Mu&s;ic, is al&s;o capable of returning the di&s;agreeable Sounds of jarring Di&s;cord.</P>
<P>Of this Truth, I believe every Writer is convinced, who is actuated by an hone&s;t Ambition to acquit him&s;elf with Honour in his Calling; for I by no Means intend to &s;peak at pre&s;ent of tho&s;e vain Scribblers, who are for ever happy in their own Self Admiration, and who are intirely Strangers to the Agitations of Mind, attendant on a Genius, &s;tudious of correcting and poli&s;hing his Piece. In fine Writing, there are &s;o many intricate Points, which demand Attention, that it mu&s;t be with the utmo&s;t Solicit de the Ta&s;k is ever accompli&s;hed. Ju&s;tne&s;s of Conception, and Truth in every Turn of Wit are indi&s;pen&s;ible Requi&s;ites; nothing can excu&s;e the Want of Delicacy of Sentiment; the Sallies of Imagi|nation, and the frolic Gambols of Invention mu&s;t be re&s;trained by Severity of Judgment, and all mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed with Per&s;picu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and Strength of Diction. Be&s;ides this, a proper Arrangement of Periods, follow|ing one another with graceful Variety, mu&s;t unite the whole into Harmony, as the Painters expre&s;s them&s;elves, when they give the la&s;t fini&s;hing Hand to their colouring, and throw that general Glow upon their Piece, which at the fir&s;t Glance &s;trikes the intelligent Spectator. But the Truth of it is, the Traces of a Mind, which can think with Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arne&s;s and Vigour upon any Subject, and pur&s;ue a Series of Ideas, one emerging from another,
<PB N="329" REF="332">and tending gradually to form an intire whole, are &s;o &s;eldom di&s;covered, that there is Rea&s;on to think it an Accompli&s;hment unattainable, without the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous Efforts of Study, and many Moments of Care and Anxiety.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t and fair Fame is among the In&s;tigations, which incite an Author to undergo all this mental Fa|tigue; but even that very Inducement is of &s;o un&s;table a Nature, the Acqui&s;ition of it &s;o uncertain, and the Te|nure &s;o precarious, that I believe, what at fir&s;t looked &s;o inviting to the Imagination, becomes at length the Writer's greate&s;t Torment. Add to this, the great Hard&s;hip of plea&s;ing that Multiplicity of Appetites, with which Mankind abound, and the &s;till greater Dif|ficulty, which every Man of Genius experiences, to plea&s;e his own private Ta&s;te. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us, in the general Preface to his Works, that he never wrote up to his own Ideas of Poetry; and <HI>Boileau,</HI> who is &s;econd to no Man for &s;ound Sen&s;e and Judgment, ob&s;erves, that an Author of Elevation in his Conceptions, is conti|nually di&s;contented with his Performances, is plea&s;ing to all the World, except him&s;elf, and, while his Wit is every where admired, that, for his own inward Quiet, he &s;incerely wi&s;hes he had never dipt his Pen in Ink.</P>

<P>I have been led into this Tract of Thought by a Re|view of my own Sen&s;ations, ever &s;ince I undertook the anxious Character of a public Writer, which I have now &s;u&s;tained for the Space of two Years, and ha|ving &s;welled the&s;e E&s;&s;ays to a &s;ufficient Number, I pur|po&s;e next <HI>Saturday</HI> finally to take Leave of my Rea|ders. In doing this, I mu&s;t own, that I perform a kind
<PB N="330" REF="333">of Self-denial, as I &s;hall then break off an habitual In|tercour&s;e with the Public, from which I have occa&s;ionally deduced a very &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure, as I have experienced that the&s;e Papers, &s;uch as they are, have, from Time to Time, conduced to the Entertainment of the Town. On this Account I &s;hall abdicate with Reluctance; but the Line, which I have quoted in my Motto from <HI>Horace,</HI> has for a long Time &s;tared me in the Face. <Q>The Shame does not lie,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>in playing the Fool, but in not di&s;continuing it,</Q> in the Ju&s;tice of which Sentiment I acquie&s;ce, and, as becomes me, conform to the Precept.</P>

<P>_AS I am now arrived to the conclu&s;ive E&s;&s;ay of the <HI>Gray's Inn</HI> Journal, the Ma&s;k mu&s;t be dropped; and the a&s;&s;umed Character of the Gay <HI>Charles Ranger</HI> mu&s;t at length dwindle into that of the real Author, who begs Leave this Day to addre&s;s his Readers in his own Name.</P>
<P>I remember the Introductory Paper to this Undertak|ing embarra&s;&s;ed my Imagination, more than any &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Compo&s;ition; as coming into Company is &s;ometimes attended with unea&s;y Flutterings, which are afterwards effaced by Habit. As I am al&s;o de&s;irous of going off with as good a Grace as po&s;&s;ible, I cannot but be a little &s;olicitous about the Manner of my Exit. In the &s;ocial Intercour&s;e of Life, I know as little Ceremony &s;hould be u&s;ed, as the Nature of all Things will admit; but the periodical Writer, cannot withdraw, without mak|ing his Bow to the Public.</P>
<P>Two different Forms of writing have offered them|&s;elves to me upon this Occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t has been prac|ti&s;ed by &s;everal Gentlemen of the Quill, and con&s;i&s;ts in a declamatory Stile again&s;t that degeneracy of Ta&s;te, which has too fatally prevailed in the pre&s;ent Declen&s;ion of Literature. In Addition to this, I might indulge my&s;elf in a Vein of Invective again&s;t the general Di&s;|po&s;ition to Gaming, and many other unavailing Amu&s;e|ments, which have called off the Attention of the better Sort of People from all literary Productions. I might further expatiate in a Strain of Raillery on the Fair, and might urge, that Woman is very ju&s;tly defined by the
<PB N="333" REF="336"><HI>Greek</HI> Pholo&s;opher, <HI>"An Animal delighting in Finery,"</HI> and that it is not in the Power of the be&s;t Writers of the Age, to attract the Attention of that wandering Sex, who are evermore entertained with the Chit-chat, which i&s;&s;ues from their own pretty red Lips, than with a Peru&s;al of a Compo&s;ition, calculated to retrench their Follies, to regulate their Fancy, to improve their Intel|lectuals, and to encourage them to the Acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e mental Beauties, &s;uch as Sweetne&s;s of Temper, Affability, and good Sen&s;e, which will be always &s;ure to confer upon them the mo&s;t permanent Embelli&s;hments, and will prove the be&s;t Wa&s;h for the Complexion, and an infallible Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Encroachments made upon the Tincture of the Skin, by Envy, Malice, Tea, Scandal, and painful Watchings at a Gaming-Table. After this I might pompou&s;ly declare, that I now decline taking any further Trouble with tho&s;e incorrigible An|gels; that I con&s;ign them entirely to their Hair-Cutters, their Dancing Ma&s;ters, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, to their own ungoverned fanta&s;tic Appetites. But this Form of Compo&s;ition is incon&s;i&s;tent with my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, as I &s;hould be glad to lay down the Pen in the good Graces of all my Readers.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Method of Addre&s;s which occurred to me, was that u&s;ed by the excellent and humorous Author of the <HI>Tale of a Tub.</HI> After his Example, I have been tempt|ed to return Thanks, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, to his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy-Council, to the Lords &s;piritual and temporal, to the honourable the Hou&s;e of Commons, to the Gentlemen of the Royal Society, to the Wor&s;hipful the Board of Aldermen, to the Club at <HI>White</HI>'s, to the Cricies at the <HI>Bedford,</HI> to the Con|no'&s;&s;eurs at <HI>Sam</HI>'s, to the Society of <HI>Grub-&s;trect,</HI> and, in &s;hort, to all Degrees and Ranks of People, for the ju&s;t and favourable Reception they have been plea&s;ed to af|ford to the mo&s;t delectable, humorous, and in&s;tructive Lucubrations, that we have publi&s;h'd in this our <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Inn
<PB N="334" REF="337">Journal,</HI> which has been the Delight of the choice Spirits of the Age, the Terror of all Offenders again&s;t Decency and Good-Manners, and which has a&s;certained to the Author an immortal Reputation;
<Q><L><HI>Jamqu&egrave; opus exegi quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignes,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nec poterit &s;errum, nec edax abolere vetu&s;tas.</HI></L></Q> But having con&s;idered this Matter with &s;ufficient Delibe|ration, I have judged it eligible to decline both the Spe|cies of Writing above exhibited. The Truth of it is, as on the one Hand I am not &s;o &s;elf-&s;ufficient as to arro|gate to my&s;elf any extraordinary Pride from the Degree of Succe&s;s I have met with; &s;o on the other, I do not think I can rea&s;onably find any Fault with the Di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Public to the pre&s;ent Writer. I have all a|long &s;teered between the two Extremes of partial popu|lar Applau&s;e, and a general Neglect; and I have there|fore no colourable Pretence to expre&s;s the lea&s;t Degree of Di&s;content at Parting, nor vain-gloriou&s;ly to exult at the Applau&s;e, which has been occa&s;ionally allowed to me.</P>
<P>I am too &s;en&s;ible, that a &s;mall Portion of Fame can be attributed to the Productions of a young Author, hur|ried down the Stream of Di&s;&s;ipation, interrupted by Avo|cations of a thou&s;and Sorts, &s;eldom enabled to write at Lei&s;ure, frequently obliged to di&s;mi&s;s the uncorrected Sheet to the Pre&s;s, rarely happy enough to have written up even to his own Ta&s;te, and often checked in his Ca|reer by the Timidity of an Adventurer, who was always diffident of his own Abilities, and was &s;en&s;ible how far &s;o young a Writer mu&s;t be from tho&s;e &s;trong Powers of Mind, which, when matured by Age and Application, animate and embolden Genius, give Authority to Criti|ci&s;m, add Strength to Compo&s;itions of a graver Ca&s;t, and in&s;pire an Author with a due Degree of Confidence
<PB N="335" REF="338">in his Deci&s;ions, upon all Occurrences in human Life, as likewi&s;e upon all Topics of Ta&s;te and Erudition.</P>
<P>Though unattended with the&s;e Advantages, it is, however, &s;ome kind of Satisfaction, that I have been able to procure my&s;elf an Audience once a Week for two Years together, from perhaps &s;everal Thou&s;ands in <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> and, on this Occa&s;ion, I cannot help taking to my|&s;elf a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure from the Reflection, that I have given a kind of Weekly Memorial of my Exi&s;tence, and force Sort of Proof, that my Time has not been thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in a Manner totally unavailing. <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> has a very fine Sentiment, which has made a very deep Im|pre&s;&s;ion on me. <HI>Verum enimvero is demum mihi vivere, &amp; frui anim&acirc; videtur, qui aliquo negotio intentus, praeclari &s;acinoris aut artis honae famam quaerit.</HI> <Q>He may be &s;aid to live, &s;ays that excellent Writer, and to enjoy the Functions of his Soul, who, engaged in a laudable Occupation, endeavours to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by &s;ome &s;plendid Action, or by the Acqui&s;ition of Fame in &s;ome liberal Art.</Q> That I have in the la&s;t Way made my&s;elf con&s;picuous, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf in my mo&s;t mo&s;t &s;anguine Moments; but I &s;hall always enjoy the plea&s;ure ea&s;ure of a well meant Endeavour, and, when I look back to the Commencement of this Undertaking, and revieiew the Means, by which I have kept my Paper alive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will not be &s;o prudi&s;h as to conceal a Degree of Self-Approbation.</P>
<P>The Plan, on which I have wrote, however f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble the Execution of it may be, I am inclined to believe is not void of Merit. In the E&s;&s;ay, there was room for all Lands of fine Writing, and in the News, there was am|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> room to entertain the Fancy with Touches of Hu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r upon the various Occurrences of human Life. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this Scheme has not been better cultivated in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> arts, mu&s;t be imputed to my having wrote &s;ingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; and this Con&s;ideration will, I hope, ren|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Inaccuracies more excu&s;able.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="339">When I &s;ay, that I have wrote alone, I do not mean that I never received any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. On the contrary, I think it incumbent on me to acknowledge, that a par|ticular Friend, who mu&s;t be namele&s;s, has furni&s;hed me occa&s;ionally with &s;everal humorous Paragraphs of News, written with a Delicacy of Humour peculiar to him&s;elf; and, I will add, that I never withdrew from his Conver&s;ation, without &s;ome Hint for the Entertain|ment of my Readers. To this Gentleman I am in|debted for a Letter from an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> No. 14; for a Scene at-<HI>Jonathan</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> No. 19; for an E&s;&s;ay on I heatrical Parties, No. 31; for an E&s;&s;ay on the modern Fa&s;hion of vi&s;iting, No. 34; for a &s;econd Scene at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s, No. 57; and for the E&s;&s;ays in 98 and 100. That I have not received more from him, I have often thought it both a Lo&s;s to the <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn Journal</HI> and the Public; as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an elegant Facility on every Subject, I &s;incerely wi&s;h that I had been able to prevail upon him, again&s;t his natural Indolence, to afford me a great deal more of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>A Paper upon what may be called Imitation in Wri|ting, and an E&s;&s;ay towards the fixing the Standard of modern Critici&s;m, together with &s;ome occa&s;ional Strokes of Humour in the true Intelligence, were the Contribu|tions of another ingenious Gentleman, who&s;e Friend|&s;hip, I am convinced, would have inclined him to do &s;omething toward rai&s;ing the E&s;timation of this Paper much higher, had not Avocations of more Con&s;equence to him&s;elf and the Public, demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take this Opportunity to thank the Author of a Letter, occa&s;ioned by my Critici&s;m on King <HI>Lear,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Warmth of Friend&s;hip, and, in my Opi|tion, was written al&s;o in the Warmth of Genius. An ingerious E&s;&s;ay on <HI>Phy&s;iognomy</HI> was al&s;o a Pre&s;ent from the Author of <HI>Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lea;</HI> the Letter, No. 12, upon a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> the Ladies Teeth,</HI> is a <HI>Jeu d'E&s;prit</HI> by a
<PB N="337" REF="340">Gentleman of a very elegant and lively Fancy. And now and then, in the News there are either Articles &s;ent by unknown Hands, or Paragraphs rai&s;ed upon their Hints. But of the&s;e the Number is extremely &s;mall; for every Thing el&s;e <HI>Ranger</HI> him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;tand account|able.</P>
<P>I have now, I think, faithfully mentioned all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I received in the Cour&s;e of this Paper, and upon this Appearance of Matters, I believe, it will be &s;ound very &s;hort of the Advantages enjoyed by &s;ome of my Brother Writers. I have not had the Happine&s;s of being puff'd in any of our common News Papers, or in that entertaining and truly u&s;eful Work, as Mr. <HI>Griffiths</HI> calls the <HI>Monthly Review.</HI> I have never been able to en|tertain the Town with the Writings of People of Fa&s;hion, nor to lay before them an <HI>E&s;&s;ay written by a Per&s;on of Honour;</HI> I could never boa&s;t the Friend&s;hip of the Nobility, nor has any Lord &s;ent me a Paper, and upon Publication bought up a thou&s;and Copies, to &s;hew me how well his own Performances &s;ell. I mu&s;t, how|ever, own, that I have always exerted my utmo&s;t Abilities, and have put every thing out of hand with as much Care as the Nature of periodical Productions, the Author's Spirits, and other Circum&s;tances would permit. I have ever had as great a Re&s;pect for the Public, as <HI>Tully</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;es for a <HI>Roman</HI> A&s;&s;embly, and I agree with him when he &s;ays, <HI>nihil huc ni&s;i perfectum ingenio, elaboratum in|du&s;tri&acirc; afferri opportere.</HI> At the &s;ame Time, I hope, it will be con&s;idered, what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob&s;erves with great Propriety, that the Public &s;hould not expect that an Au|thor's whole Time &s;hould be &s;pent in poli&s;hing and re|touching for their Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, why may not a Per&s;on rather chu&s;e an Air of bold Negligence, than the ob&s;cure Diligence of Pedants, and Writers of affected Phra&s;eology? For my Part, I have always thought an ea&s;y Stile more eligible than a pompous Diction, lifted up by Metaphor, ampli&s;ied
<PB N="338" REF="341">by Epithet, and digni&s;ied by too frequent In&s;ertions of the <HI>Latin</HI> Idiom. I am therefore inclined to flatter my|&s;elf, that my Expre&s;&s;ion has been natural and unambi|tious; and that my Arrangement has been grammatically ju&s;t, unperplexed and clear, and that upon all Occa|&s;ions I have written with &s;ome Degree of Purity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if I cannot boa&s;t of having pro|duced edifying Strains of Morality, Di&s;&s;ertations of uncontrovertible Critici&s;m, and Papers of exqui&s;ite Mirth and Humour, I hope, at lea&s;t the whole Plan has been conducted with a &s;trict Regard to Decency, and without any Offence again&s;t Virtue or good Manners. To this Circum&s;tance, I believe it in a great Mea&s;ure owing, that I have been &s;o &s;avourably received by the Town; but be the Cau&s;e, what it may, I &s;hall always retain a grateful Sen&s;e of their Indulgence, and in what|ever Way, hereafter I may endeavour to entertain them, I &s;hall think they have a Demand upon me for the mo&s;t vigorous Exertion of my Abilities, and, let my Succe&s;s|be as it will, I at lea&s;t hope I &s;hall have Judgment enough not entirely to mi&s;take my Talents.</P>
<P>Having avowed the&s;e Sentiments I &s;hall conclude without any &s;tudied flouri&s;h of Period, and I remain with great Re&s;pect to all my Readers in particular, and to the Public in general,</P>
