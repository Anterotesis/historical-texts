<HEAD>THE GRAND ASSIZES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was in a certain country a great King, who was al&s;o a Judge. He was very merciful, but he was al&s;o very ju&s;t; for he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that ju&s;tice was the foundation of all goodne&s;s. His &s;ubjects were apt enough, in a general way, to ex|tol his merciful temper, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ub|jects who were always committing crimes which made them liable to be puni&s;hed by his ju&s;tice. This la&s;t quality they con&s;tantly kept out of &s;ight, till they had cheated them&s;elves into a notion that he was too good to puni&s;h at all.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">Now it had happened a long time before, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the King's favor, and had al&s;o fallen from a very pro&s;perous &s;tate in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts; but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay&punc; the King's &s;on mo&s;t generou&s;ly took the whole burthen of their debts on him&s;elf; and, in &s;hort&punc; it was propo&s;ed that all their affairs &s;hould be &s;ettled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) pro|vided only they would &s;hew them&s;elves, to be &s;orry for what they had done them&s;elves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I &s;hould however re|mark, that a book was al&s;o given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebellion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the King's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in the time to come; and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after hav|ing lived a certain number of years in a part of the &s;ame King's country, and under his eye and juri&s;|diction, there &s;hould be a Grand A&s;&s;izes, when every one was to be publicly tried for his pa&s;t behaviour, and after this trial was over, certain heavy puni&s;h|ments were to be inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hould have &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be&s;towed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to notice, that this King's Court differed in &s;ome re&s;pects from our Courts of Ju&s;tice, being indeed a &s;ort of Court of Appeal,
<PB N="5" REF="4">to which que&s;tions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the Common Courts. And although with us all criminals are tried, (and very properly in my opinion) by a Jury of their Peers; yet in this King's country the mode was very differ|ent; for &s;ince every one of the people had been in a certain &s;en&s;e criminals, the King did not think it fair to make them judges al&s;o. It would, indeed, have been impo&s;&s;ible to follow in all re&s;pects the cu&s;toms which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are charged in our Courts are mere "overt acts," as the Lawyers call them, that is, acts which regard the outward behavior; &s;uch as the acts of &s;triking, maiming, &s;tealing, and &s;o forth. But in the King's Court it was not merely outward &s;ins, but &s;ins of the heart al&s;o which were to be puni&s;hed. Many a crime therefore, which was never heard of in the Court of King's-bench, or at the Old Baily, was here to be brought to light, and was re&s;erved for this great day. Among the&s;e were Pride, and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Envy, and Malice, and Revenge, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ecret Vanity of Mind, and Evil Thoughts of all &s;orts, and all evil Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires. When Covetou&s;ne&s;s, in|deed, put men on committing Robbery, or when Malice drove them to an act of Murder, then the common Courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for the&s;e Great A&s;&s;izes; neverthe|le&s;s, &s;ince even a Thief and Murderer would now and then e&s;cape in the common Courts, for want of evidence, or through &s;ome fault or other of the Judge or Jury, the e&s;cape was of little moment to the poor criminal, for he was &s;ure to be tried again
<PB N="6" REF="5">by this great King; and even though the man &s;hould have been puni&s;hed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e before, yet he had now a farther puni&s;hment to fear, unle&s;s, indeed he was one of tho&s;e, who had obtained by the means I before &s;poke of) this great King's pardon. The &s;ins of the heart, however, were by far the mo&s;t numerous &s;ort of &s;ins, which were to come before this great Tribunal; and the&s;e were to be judged by this great King in per&s;on, and by none but him|&s;elf; becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a certain power of get|ting at all &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>I once heard of a certain King of Sicily, who built a whi&s;pering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word his rebel|lious &s;ubjects uttered, though &s;poken ever &s;o low. But this &s;ecret of the King of Sicily was nothing to what this great King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for he He had the power of knowing every thought which was con|ceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</P>
<P>Now you may be ready to think, perhaps, that the&s;e people were wor&s;e off than any others, be|cau&s;e they were to be examined &s;o clo&s;ely, and judged &s;o &s;trictly. Far from it: the King was too ju&s;t to expect bricks without giving them &s;traw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of directions, as I before ob&s;erved; and becau&s;e they were naturally &s;hort-&s;ighted, he &s;upplied them with a gla&s;s for reading it, and thus the mo&s;t dim-&s;ighted might &s;ee, if they did not wilfully &s;hut their eyes; but though
<PB N="7" REF="6">the King <HI>invited</HI> them to open their eyes, he did not <HI>compel</HI> them; and many remained &s;tone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, becau&s;e they would not u&s;e the gla&s;s, nor take the proper means for reading and under&s;tanding all that was written for them. The humble and &s;incere learnt in time to &s;ee even that part of the book which was lea&s;t plainly written; and it was ob&s;erved that the ability to under&s;tand it depended more on the heart than the head; an evil di&s;po&s;ition blinded the &s;ight, while humility operated like an eye-&s;alve.</P>
<P>Now it happened that tho&s;e who had been &s;o lucky as to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of the lower Courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good &s;ort of people, and of cour&s;e very &s;afe from any danger at this <HI>Great A&s;&s;ize.</HI> This grand intended trial, indeed, had been talked of &s;o much and put off &s;o long, (for it had &s;eemed long at lea&s;t to the&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted people) that many per|&s;uaded them&s;elves it would never take place at all; and far the greater part were living away there|fore without ever thinking about it; they went on ju&s;t as if nothing at all had been done for their be|nefit; and as if they had no King to plea&s;e, no King's &s;on to be thankful to, no book to guide them&s;elves by, and as if the A&s;&s;izes were never to come about.</P>
<P>But with this King "a thou&s;and years were as one day, for he was not &s;lack concerning his pro|mi&s;es, as &s;ome men count &s;lackne&s;s." So at length the &s;olemn period approached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the &s;olemnity, or
<PB N="8" REF="7">rather, they prepared for it much as &s;ome of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the A&s;&s;ize times; I mean by balls and fea&s;tings, and they &s;aw their own trial come on, with as little concern as is felt by the people in our &s;treets, when they &s;ee the Judge's proce&s;&s;ion enter the town, who indeed comfort them&s;elves that it is only tho&s;e in the pri|&s;ons who are guilty.</P>
<P>But when at la&s;t the day came, and every man found that he was to be judged for him&s;elf, and that &s;ome how or other, all his &s;ecrets were brought out, and that there was now no e&s;cape, things be|gan to take a more &s;erious turn. Some of the wor&s;t of the criminals were got together debating in an outer Court of the Grand Hall, and there they pa&s;&s;ed their time, not in compunction with tears, not in comparing their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing them&s;elves with &s;uch as had been &s;till more notorious offenders.</P>
<P>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and op|pre&s;&s;ion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, in&s;ulted a poor fellow as a thief, be|cau&s;e he had &s;tolen a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was, &s;aid a Citizen to his Ap|prentice, for you drank and &s;wore at the ale-hou&s;e every Sunday night." "Yes," &s;aid the poor fel|low, "but it was your fault that I did &s;o, for you took no care of my &s;oul, but &s;pent all your Sabbaths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach
<PB N="9" REF="8">me; I might have followed a good example, but I &s;aw only bad ones. I &s;inned again&s;t le&s;s light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had &s;pent all his wages on gin, took comfort that he had not &s;pent a great e&s;tate in Bribery at Elections, as the Lord of his Manor had done, while a perjured Elector boa&s;ted that he was no drunkard, like the journeyman.</P>
<P>I have not room to de&s;cribe the awful pomp of the Court, nor the terrible &s;ounding of the trumpet which attended the Judge's entrance, nor the &s;itting of the Judge, nor the opening the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who &s;tood before him. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the multitudes who were tried and con|demned to dungeons and chains, and fire, and to per|petual bani&s;hment from the pre&s;ence of the King, which always &s;eemed to be the &s;adde&s;t part of the &s;entence. I &s;hall only notice further, a few who brought &s;ome plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the King, and even deceived them|&s;elves &s;o far as to think that his own book of laws would be their ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>A thoughtle&s;s Spendthrift advanced without any contrition, and &s;aid, "that he had lived hand&s;omely, and had hated the covetous whom God abhor|reth, and that he tru&s;ted in that pa&s;&s;age of the book, which &s;aid, that 'Covetou&s;ne&s;s was Ido|latry;' and that he therefore hoped for a favorable &s;entence." Now it proved that this man had not only avoided Covetou&s;ne&s;s, but that he had even left his wife and children in want through his exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="10" REF="9">prodigality. The Judge therefore immediately pointed to that place in the Book where it is written, "he that provideth not for his hou&s;ehold, is wor&s;e than an infidel." "He that liveth in plea&s;ure is dead while he liveth; "thou," &s;aid he, "in thy life-time, re|ceived&s;t thy good things, and now thou mu&s;t be tormented."&mdash;Then a Mi&s;er, whom hunger and hoarding had worn to &s;kin and bone, crept forward, and prai&s;ed the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on this extravagant youth, "and &s;urely," &s;aid he, "&s;ince he is condemned, I am the man that may make &s;ome plea to favor&mdash; I was never idle or drunk, I kept my body in &s;ubjection. I have been &s;o &s;elf-denying that I am certainly a Saint: I have loved neither father nor mother, nor wife, nor children to exce&s;s, in all this I have obeyed the book of the law.&mdash;Then the Judge &s;aid, "but where are thy works of mercy and thy labors of love? &s;ee that family which pe|ri&s;hed in thy &s;ight la&s;t hard winter, while thy barns were overflowing; that poor family were my repre|&s;entatives, yet they were hungry, and thou gave&s;t them no meat." "Go to now, thou rich man, weep and howl for the mi&s;eries that are come upon you. Your gold and your &s;ilver is cankered, and the ru&s;t of them &s;hall be a witne&s;s again&s;t you, and &s;hall eat your fle&s;h as it were fire."&mdash;Then came up one with a mo&s;t &s;elf-&s;ufficient air. He walked up boldly, having in one hand the plan of an Ho&s;pital which he had built, and in the other the drawing of a &s;tatue, which was erecting for him in the country that he had ju&s;t left, and on his forehead appeared, in Gold Letters, the Li&s;t of all the Public Charities to which he had &s;ub&s;cribed. He &s;eemed to take
<PB N="11" REF="10">great plea&s;ure in the condemnation of the Mi&s;er, and &s;aid, "Lord, where &s;aw <HI>I</HI> thee hungry and fed thee not, or in pri&s;on and vi&s;ited thee not? I have vi&s;ited the fatherle&s;s and widow in their affliction." &mdash;Here the Judge cut him &s;hort, by &s;aying, "True, thou did&s;t vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s, but did&s;t thou fulfil equally that other part of my command "to keep thy&s;elf un&s;potted from the world." No, thou wert conformed to the world in many of it's &s;inful cu&s;|toms, "thou did&s;t follow a multitude to do evil;" "thou did&s;t love the world and the things of the world;" and the motive to all thy charities was not a regard to me but to thy own credit with thy fel|low men. Thou ha&s;t done every thing for the &s;ake of reputation, and now thou art vainly tru&s;ting in thy works, in&s;tead of putting all thy tru&s;t in my Son, who has offered him&s;elf to be a &s;urety for thee. Where has been that humility and gratitude to him which was required of thee. No, thou wouldk be thine own &s;urety: thou ha&s;t tru&s;ted in thy&s;elf: thou ha&s;t made thy boa&s;t of thine own goodne&s;s; thou ha&s;t &s;ought after and thou ha&s;t en|joyed the prai&s;e of men, and verily I &s;ay unto thee, "thou ha&s;t had thy reward."</P>
<P>A poor di&s;ea&s;ed blind cripple, from the very Ho&s;pital which this great man had built, then fell pro&s;trate on his face, crying out, "Lord be mer|ciful to me a &s;inner!" on which the Judge, to the &s;urprize of all, &s;aid, "Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant." The poor man replied, "Lord, I have done nothing!"&mdash;"But thou ha&s;t <HI>&s;uffered well</HI>" &s;aid the Judge; "thou ha&s;t been an example
<PB N="12" REF="11">of patience and meekne&s;s, and though thou had&s;t but few talents, yet thou ha&s;t well improved tho&s;e few; thou had&s;t time, this thou did&s;t &s;pend in the humble duties of thy &s;tation, and al&s;o in earne&s;t prayer, even for that proud Founder of thine Ho&s;pital, who never prayed for him&s;elf; thou wa&s;t indeed blind and lame, but it is no where &s;aid, my Son give me thy feet, or thine eyes, but <HI>give me thy heart;</HI> and even the faculties I did grant thee, were employed to my glory; with thine ears thou did&s;t li&s;ten to my word, with thy tongue thou did&s;t &s;hew forth my prai&s;e, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."&mdash;There were &s;everal who came forward, and boa&s;ted of &s;ome &s;ingle and particular virtue, in which they had been &s;uppo&s;ed to excel. One talked of his genero&s;ity, another of his courage, and a third of his fortitude; but it proved, on a clo&s;e examination, that &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed virtues were merely the effect of a particular con|&s;titution of body: that others proceeded from a fal&s;e motive, and that not a few of them were ac|tual vices, &s;ince they were carried to exce&s;s; and under the pretence of fulfilling one duty, &s;ome other duty was lo&s;t &s;ight of; in &s;hort, the&s;e partial virtues were none of them done in obedience to the will of the King, but merely to plea&s;e the per&s;on's own humour, and they would not, therefore, &s;tand this day's trial, for "he that had kept the whole law, and yet had wilfully and habitually offended in any one point, was declared guilty of breaking the whole.</P>
<P>At this moment a &s;ort of thick &s;cales fell from the eyes of the multitude. They could now no
<PB N="13" REF="12">longer take comfort by mea&s;uring their neighbours' conduct again&s;t their own. Each at once &s;aw him|&s;elf in his true light, and found, alas! when it was too late, that he &s;hould have made the book which had been given him his rule of practice before, &s;ince it now proved to be the rule by which he was to be judged. Nay, every one now thought him&s;elf even wor&s;e than his neighbour, becau&s;e, while he only <HI>&s;aw</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> of the guilt of others, he <HI>felt</HI> his own in all its aggravated horrors.</P>
<P>To complete their confu&s;ion, they were com|pelled to acknowledge the ju&s;tice of the Judge who condemned them; and al&s;o to approve the favorable &s;entence by which thou&s;ands of other criminals had not only their lives &s;aved, but were made happy and glorious beyond all imagination, and all this was in con&s;equence of their &s;incere repentance, and their humble acceptance of the pardon offered to them by the King's Son. One thing was remarkable, that whil&s;t mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were condemned, never expected condemna|tion, but even claimed a reward for their &s;uppo&s;ed innocence or goodne&s;s, all who were really re|warded and forgiven were &s;en&s;ible that they owed every thing to a mere act of grace, and they cried out with one voice, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the prai&s;e!!!</P>
