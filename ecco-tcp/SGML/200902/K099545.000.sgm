<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing a &s;hort Account of Sir HUM|PHREY's Predece&s;&s;ors, from the fir&s;t BA|RONET of his Family.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH the following Piece is not of a Biographical Nature, the Author thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome &s;hort Account of him&s;elf and his Family, that thereby forming a Kind of Acquaintance with his Readers, they may pur&s;ue their Journey together thro' the LUNAR WORLD with more Cordia|lity and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is well known by tho&s;e who have Skill in Heraldry, that the LUNATICS <HI>have been a con&s;iderable Family, ever &s;ince</HI> ENG|LAND
<PB N="2" REF="7">
WAS ENGLAND; they have occa|&s;ionally been at the Helm of State; they have nodded upon Wooll-Packs in Lawn Sleeves; they have di&s;pen&s;ed Law from under Voluminous Wigs; they have ra|vaged Nations with Armies, and plowed the Deep with Fleets; in &s;hort, they have filled every Station in Life, from Princes to Coblers; from Duche&s;&s;es to Cham|bermaids: To make a complete De|tail of Genealogical Particulars, would be a Work of in&s;ufferable Prolixity and O&s;tentation; wherefore the AUTHOR will only revert to his Great Grandfather, the fir&s;t BARONET of <HI>his</HI> Part of the Fa|mily; and proceed from him in a direct Line, without Regard to &s;everal other di|&s;tingui&s;hed collateral Branches.</P>
<P>WHIMSICAL LUNATIC, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> after|wards Sir WHIMSICAL, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf much by his Zeal in Favour of Royalty, at that Critical Period when the
<PB N="3" REF="8">
REPUBLICAN Party made &s;uch &s;evere At|tacks upon the weak and unfortunate FIRST CHARLES; nor did he, like the mercenary &s;laves of Intere&s;t, attach him|&s;elf, till Rebellion had &s;o far gained the A&s;cendant, that Hope was fluttering on its la&s;t Wing; not PERSIAN like, a Wor|&s;hipper of the ri&s;ing, but a faithful fol|lower of the &s;etting Sun; pur&s;uing his Beams even into the profound Darkne&s;s that en&s;ued, with a Spirit truly heroic he join'd the general Wreck, which depriv'd the Monarch of his Life, and him&s;elf, among many others, of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus reduced, for &s;ome Time he com|forted him&s;elf with the Opinion of CATO; that it is a nece&s;&s;ary Compliment in every good Citizen to join the Ruin of his Country: However, Want of Mo|ney, which generally gives Time for Re|flection, and adds Force to it, &s;oon led him to entertain a different Notion of
<PB N="4" REF="9">
the prevailing Party; through the Op|tics of Nece&s;&s;ity fre&s;h Notions of Free|dom entered his ever active Brain; Non|re&s;i&s;tance and Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, his darling Principles, vani&s;hed like Mi&s;ts before the Sun, and a new Kind of Pa|trioti&s;m &s;o enflamed him, that he com|menced one of tho&s;e public-&s;pirited Ora|tors, &s;ince di&s;graced by the Title of Fa|natic Preachers.</P>
<P>Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great Volubility, Force of Expre&s;&s;ion, and Luxuriance of Fancy, he &s;oon became highly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in his New Capacity; and as Converts are generally mo&s;t zealous again&s;t the Cau&s;e they have for&s;aken, he was e&s;teemed &s;o valuable an Acqui&s;ition, that CROMWELL cau&s;ed his E&s;tate to be re&s;tored, and had him elected a Member of his fir&s;t PARLIAMENT; in which Situ|ation he made a very con&s;iderable Fi|gure: No one in the Debates com|manded
<PB N="5" REF="10" MS="y">
more Attention and Re&s;pect. Hence he might have been eminently advanced in the State; but, like a true LUNATIC, being fond of Oppo&s;ition, and di&s;daining to run with the Stream long, he began to find Fault with the Conduct of Public Affairs; openly de|claring, that the Plan of PLATO'S RE|PUBLIC, with &s;ome Alterations and Amendments of his own, would be the only &s;ure Foundation for National Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>His Objections to almo&s;t every Mea|&s;ure propo&s;ed, rendered him remarkably obnoxious within Doors, but made him popular without; however, as in tho&s;e days the VOX POPULI was not e&s;teemed the VOX DEI, he reaped no other Advan|tage from his hardy and anxious Endea|vours, but &s;ome faint Gales of whi&s;pered Applau&s;e; for public Acclamations in Favour of laborious Patriots, were not
<PB N="6" REF="11">
then &s;o common or &s;o &s;afe as they have been &s;ince.</P>
<P>Plumed up and animated with the Ap|probation of many as di&s;contented as him&s;elf, he gave full Scope to his Zeal, without apparently waking the Dragon Power from his Slumbers, as his Keepers &s;hrewdly fore&s;aw that to lie in Wait for hot-brained Politicians is the &s;ure&s;t Me|thod of circumventing them: And even &s;o it happened with the illu&s;trious Per&s;on|age here &s;poken of, who grew &s;o extremely violent upon the Motion for con&s;tituting CROMWELL LORD PROTECTOR, which he &s;aid was only a &s;ofter Name for TYRANT, that his Fury knew no Bounds, but hur|ried him to &s;uch Lengths of general and per&s;onal Reflection, that he was not only expelled the Hou&s;e as a &s;editious Mem|ber, but was al&s;o put under legal Pro&s;e|cution, and amerced with &s;o heavy a Fine for Defamation, that his E&s;tate could
<PB N="7" REF="12">
&s;tretch little farther than to &s;ave him from a Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus, once again &s;unk into the unho|&s;pitable and chilling Shade of Fortune, he had no Comfort left but the Upright|ne&s;s of his own Heart, and &s;ome di&s;tant Hopes that Matters might yet take a more favourable Turn; which however did not happen till &s;ome &s;hort Time be|fore CROMWELL'S Decea&s;e; when, a rich Relation dying, he obtained a Legacy that redeemed his E&s;tate, and enabled him to appear in public with Re&s;pect; for Re&s;pect u&s;ually follows the Circum|&s;tances, and not the Qualifications of a Man.</P>
<P>At this Period, as if his Life had not been already &s;ufficiently di&s;turbed, he took it into his Head to marry a &s;econd Wife, his own Hou&s;e-keeper; who being rai&s;ed to the Degree of Mi&s;tre&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="8" REF="13">
of Youth without Prudence, and Beauty without Under&s;tanding, made &s;uch large Strides to arbitrary Power, that all her Hu&s;band's REPUBLICAN Principles could not &s;tem the Torrent of her Pride and Extravagance. This do|me&s;tic Concern kept him from meddling any further in Politics, than addre&s;&s;ing his Life and Fortune, among the other good People of ENGLAND, to RICHARD CROMWELL, &s;ome Years Poverty having made him approve of the Office of PRO|TECTOR. However, upon hearing of CHARLES'S Approach, his Heart took &s;uch a Yearning towards the lawful Prince, and indefea&s;ible hereditary Right flowed back upon him in &s;uch a Tide of Loyal|ty, that he was one of the foremo&s;t to transfer Allegiance from RICHARD to CHARLES; in Acknowledgment of which forward Zeal that good-humour'd, liberal Monarch created him a BARONET; inti|mating, at the &s;ame Time, a De&s;ign, when
<PB N="9" REF="14">
Affairs were entirely &s;ettled, of extending his Royal Bounty in a Manner more wor|thy his great De&s;ervings.</P>
<P>But, alas! how vain, tran&s;itory, and de|lu&s;ive are human Expectations? How &s;peedily does the ever-gaping Grave &s;wallow up the air-built Fabrics of Ima|gination? Some few Nights after his new Dignity had been conferred upon him, the BARONET, while his heart was expanding with Joy at his Country's Fe|licity, &s;acrificed &s;o profu&s;ely at the Shrine of BACCHUS, and &s;wallowed &s;o many Bum|pers for the PUBLIC GOOD, that, falling a&s;leep among &s;ome as much intoxicated as him&s;elf, he was, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;tifled, being found dead in his Chair by a Wai|ter. Thus&mdash;oh fatal and irreparable Chance!&mdash;died that great Man, who ex|pired, as he had lived, in the Cau&s;e of old ENGLAND, a real and uniform LUNA|TIC.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">
As Impartiality is the very E&s;&s;ence of Hi&s;tory, it &s;hall be mo&s;t carefully pre&s;er|ved upon this Occa&s;ion; wherefore, tho' Nature may plead to draw a Veil over the Failings of Ance&s;tors, yet our Au|thor cannot help acknowledging that Sir WHIMSICAL'S Succe&s;&s;or deviated con|&s;iderably from the Dignity of his Name and Family; for notwith&s;tanding he had &s;o bright an Example before him, to light him on his Way like another AR|CADIAN STAR, and came to his E&s;tate in a bu&s;tling Time, yet did he meanly be|take him&s;elf to the Retirement of a Coun|try Life, making the Improvement of his Fortune, the comfortable Settlement of his Tenants, a plentiful Hou&s;e, and half a Dozen &s;ociable Neighbours, his chief Plea&s;ure: However, this phlegmatic Cloud, as I may call him, upon the Glory of the LUNATICS, complai&s;antly retired in &s;even or eight Years, and made Way for Sir HUMPHREY, Father of the Author.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">
Here Family-Splendor again began to break forth; the young BARONET fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf eminently upon the famous Bill of Exclu&s;ion &s;o boldly framed again&s;t JAMES Duke of YORK, after|wards King. During the &s;hort Reign of that ob&s;tinate Prince, he alternately &s;up|ported Royal Prerogative and popular Liberty; &s;o, being of both Sides, reaped Advantage from neither. He was not in the A&s;&s;ociation for inviting the Prince of ORANGE, yet joined him &s;oon after his Arrival; notwith&s;tanding which he was always one of the foremo&s;t to cramp that Monarch in the Operations of Govern|ment. The War of Queen ANNE he vehe|mently declared again&s;t; and, when the War was ended, was as vehement again&s;t the Peace of UTRECHT; ju&s;t after which he died, expiring with this Wi&s;h, that the Authors of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Peace might never en|joy <HI>Peace.</HI> In &s;hort, he was deeply con|cerned in the political Occurrences of
<PB N="12" REF="17">
five-and-thirty Years, fully inheriting the glorious Spirit of Oppo&s;ition, and exert|ing it with &s;uch Effect, that he was the main Cau&s;e of removing a Dozen Mini|&s;ters of State, mo&s;t of whom he thought hone&s;t till in Office; but became con|vinced at la&s;t, by repeated Experience, that if at any Time PLACE-HUNTERS do act upon ju&s;t Principles and are uncor|rupt, their Virtue can only be compared to that of tho&s;e Women, who are cha&s;te for want of Temptation or Opportunity.</P>
<P>Our AUTHOR was, at the Time of his Father's Decea&s;e, but twelve Years old; and, by his Will, put under the Guardian|&s;hip of a Per&s;on, who had &s;trict Charge to in&s;pire him with the Love of &s;ome occult Science which might render him famous: Accordingly, his Genius being con&s;ulted, A&s;tronomy was fixed upon, in which he made an a&s;toni&s;hing Progre&s;s; but as he is &s;till alive, and an Actor on this great Stage
<PB N="13" REF="18">
of Life, we &s;hall leave his Character and Portrait to a future Day, that we may not incur the Charge of Flattery or Malice, by pointing out Beauties or Defects.</P>
<P>Be it &s;ufficient then to remark, that the pre&s;ent Sir HUMPHREY, tho' inti|mately acquainted with all Political Con|cerns, tho' a faithful Repre&s;entative of his Con&s;tituents, yet has taken a different Method to the immortalizing his Name, and embalming it for Po&s;terity; viewing terre&s;trial Concerns, where &s;carce any Thing but Self-Love, and its Train of &s;ordid Con&s;equences, prevails, but as &s;e|condary Points of Care to a wi&s;e Man. He has &s;tudiou&s;ly traver&s;ed the whole Planetary Sy&s;tem; and tho' &s;ome worldly Grubs may look on him as a mere Star|gazer, the following Account of his TRIP TO THE MOON will &s;how that he de&s;erves as exalted a Place in the Rolls of FAME, as any LUNATIC that ever
<PB N="14" REF="19">
made a Figure in Life; having this Ad|vantage over his Predece&s;&s;ors of con&s;pi|cuous Memory, that his Fame is, in the humble&s;t View, founded upon innocent, not de&s;tructive Principles; upon univer|&s;al, wondrous Philo&s;ophical Harmony; not violent, de&s;tructive Political Di&s;&s;en|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this Sen&s;e he has con&s;ented to &s;ub|mit him&s;elf and the following Journal to public Opinion; per&s;uaded that however peculiar the Things he is to relate may appear, daily Experience proves they are not le&s;s true for being &s;trange; and he even flatters him&s;elf that they may not be le&s;s entertaining becau&s;e derived from a Country and People &s;eldom mentioned in our World; for it is a Country much to be admired, and a People, in many Points, highly de&s;erving Imitation.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sir HUMPHREY's Tran&s;lation to the MOON; his Reception in the I&s;land of NOIBLA; Ceremony at the NOTLAM; and his En|try into the City of NODNOL.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving always attentively bu&s;ied my|&s;elf in the Contemplation of tho&s;e innumerable and wonderful Bodies, which catching Light from the Sun, when he de&s;cends below our Hemi&s;phere, adorn the Firmament with golden Specks, for &s;uch they &s;eem to una&s;&s;i&s;ted mortal Eyes; and being always extremely curious to examine whatever related to tho&s;e Bo|dies, I form'd great Expectations from a Piece which once fell into my Hands, called BERGERAC'S VOYAGE to the MOON; the Title indeed gave me parti|cular Plea&s;ure, as I hoped to find &s;ome|what very extraordinary in the Con|tents; yet was I va&s;tly deceived, for tho'
<PB N="16" REF="21">
there are &s;trong Marks of Genius in that Production, upon the whole I could di&s;|cover nothing very intere&s;ting; however the Thought of a Journey to the LUNAR WORLD &s;truck very deep, and all my Calculations, all my Wi&s;hes, were ever after a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed on the effect|ing &s;uch a Jaunt; till at la&s;t, without any apparent Merit of mine, it happened in the following Manner.</P>
<P>The latter End of la&s;t MAY, taking a nightly Walk of Contemplation, I a&s;cend|ed a green Hill of con&s;iderable Height, who&s;e Top was &s;haded with Trees, from whence, in awful Silence, broke only by lulling Notes from the plaintive Nightin|gale, I beheld, below me, a &s;pacious Vale, inter&s;ected by the &s;low and &s;tately Stream of a well-known River, &s;kirted by a venerable Grove, who&s;e Branches, as SHAKESPEAR has it, were &s;ilvered by the MOONSHINE'S <HI>watry Beams;</HI> that Planet
<PB N="17" REF="22">
having then filled its Orb with mo&s;t un|u&s;ual Lu&s;tre, wrapped up in plea&s;ing Melancholy, Slumber in&s;en&s;ibly fell up|on me, and from thence I dropp'd into a profound Sleep.</P>
<P>How long this &s;oft Semblance of Death remained upon me I cannot &s;ay; but ima|gine, Reader, if thou can&s;t, my Surprize, and let me add &s;ome Terror al&s;o, when, upon waking, I found my&s;elf &s;eated in a Kind of Triumphal Car, &s;urrounded by a great Number of human Figures, not one of which I had the lea&s;t Idea of; yet all &s;hewing many Marks of Re&s;pect, and murmuring out an extraordinary Kind of Joy. My A&s;toni&s;hment being too vi&s;ible for Di&s;gui&s;e, a Per&s;on of vene|rable A&s;pect addre&s;&s;ed me as follows, mo&s;t profound Attention being given by the &s;urrounding Crowd, who &s;eemed to have much more Plea&s;ure in the Prac|tice

<P>When a Man looks upon a Female, who mu&s;t be at lea&s;t five and not more than ten Years under his Age, he is, when the fir&s;t Opportunity offers, to make his Regard known with plain unadorned Sincerity; he is not, by any Degree of Flattery ever &s;o di&s;tant or de|licate, to warp her Judgment, nor, by any Pre&s;ents, to bribe her Inclination: If &s;he is free from the Sollicitation of any other, &s;he may give him all mode&s;t En|couragement; or, on the contrary, if &s;he happens to be engaged in any previous Treaty, &s;he is, without Re&s;erve, to let him know it, in which Ca&s;e he mu&s;t im|mediately de&s;i&s;t; but if &s;he &s;hould en|deavour to keep him in Su&s;pence, and extend her Conver&s;ation to others at the &s;ame Time, when it comes to be known all the Parties &s;he has encouraged have

<P>This makes Females cautious how they commence Coquettes, and frees di&s;inte|re&s;ted Love from the painful Anxieties of Su&s;pence. On the other Side, if a Man addre&s;&s;es a Female, and afterwards de|clines to marry her, he is bani&s;hed; and any Couple who chance to be convicted of cohabiting before Marriage, are not only rendered incapable of ever marry|ing, but are al&s;o publickly &s;tigmatized, which prevents ill-de&s;igning Men from making, or weak Women from belie|ving, any Promi&s;es tending to the Di&s;|grace of one, and the Ruin of the other.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Manner of &s;ummoning the NOIBLANS to the TEMPLE; Ceremonies preparative to entering the TEMPLE; and the Charge given before Admi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Some Account of the NOIBLAN RELIGION; Ob&s;erva|tions upon Earthly Places of Wor&s;hip; the NAMREDAL's Plan for new modelling the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics in ENGLAND.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOSE Per&s;ons, you hear, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, are SNERRUNETS to the SALMINA, Servitors to the TEMPLE; they are now &s;ummoning the People to the VESPERS, and the Words they U&s;e are NOIGLEVER GENVELA, be <HI>grateful to God.</HI> Every one obeys this Call, and you will immediately have an Opportunity of &s;eeing the NOIBLAN Method of Wor&s;hip. Come, go with me, the Citizens are in waiting to conduct us.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="110">
As the Ceremonies mu&s;t be new and &s;omewhat unintelligible to you, your be&s;t Method will be to follow the Motions of others, do what you &s;ee done, and in your own Heart, after your own Manner and Ideas, pay Adoration to the Supreme Di|rector of all Things; his Prai&s;e and Glory is the ultimate End of all that de&s;erves the Name of Religion. Sincerity of Inten|tion is the fir&s;t and principal Recommen|dation to Divine Acceptance, which it will certainly obtain: It is not the Splendor nor the worldly Value of an Offering, but the Affection and Duty of him who pre|&s;ents it, that can plea&s;e an Omnipotent Receiver.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing thro' a con&s;iderable Number of attending CITIZENS, we went forward to the TEMPLE; in our Way I could not but admire the extremely neat Regularity of the Streets, and the uniform Compactne&s;s of the Hou&s;es, which will be &s;poken of

more at large hereafter. Coming near the Place of Wor&s;hip, I perceived it to be a mo&s;t &s;pacious &s;exagonal Building, ri&s;ing into a magnificent Dome; it &s;tood upon a green Eminence of con&s;iderable Height, over the Sides of which flowed &s;everal &s;portive Rills of Water, &s;o tran&s;|parent, that its Sparkles out-&s;hone the Lu&s;tre of our highe&s;t-poli&s;h'd Diamonds.</P>
<P>The TEMPLE was con&s;tructed of a Stone re&s;embling EMERALD, united with Cement of a Gold Colour; the Dome appeared to be of Chry&s;tal, &s;upported by a va&s;t Number of Pillars of the AME|THIST Hue, with Capitals and Ba&s;is of the pure&s;t White; the Order of Archi|tecture appeared very different from any I had ever &s;een, and exhibited to View &s;omewhat elegantly &s;ingular, pre&s;erving a Cha&s;tne&s;s of Grandeur not to be found in the gro&s;&s;er Materials of terre&s;trial Magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">
Having entered the AREA of the TEM|PLE, the NAMREDAL, and all who at|tended him, went to &s;everal Ba&s;ons of tran&s;parent, Saffron-coloured Stone, dip|ped their Heads into Water, wa&s;hed their Hands, and dried both with Cloths of|fered them by Servants of the Church: I did &s;o likewi&s;e; when &s;traight we entered a mo&s;t beautiful and &s;pacious ISLE, where we were no &s;ooner placed, than in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly &s;uch a thick impenetrable Dark|ne&s;s wrapped us round, that I could by no Means &s;ee tho&s;e Per&s;ons who &s;tood clo&s;e by: At the &s;ame Time, from above, below, and every Side, the mo&s;t di&s;mal Sounds, undulating thro' the Building, &s;truck my a&s;toni&s;hed Ears, and, I may add, intimidated me not a little.

opening, &s;uch a Flood of Light bur&s;t upon us, from many Thou&s;ands of Chry|&s;tal Lamps, that my Eyes could hardly bear &s;o powerful a Contra&s;t: The doleful Howlings were changed into Melody that might almo&s;t be called Cele&s;tial.

<P><PB N="107" REF="114">
Three AVOZENS, habited in graceful and awful Robes, now approached from the inner TEMPLE, at which all the Con|gregation bowed to the Earth; the elder of the three, &s;upported by the other two, &s;poke, as I was informed afterwards, in the following Manner: <Q REND="inline"><P><HI>Children of God, I charge ye in his holy and tremendous Name, (and remember that before him you cannot di&s;&s;emble) if any cor|rupt Thoughts at pre&s;ent taint your Brea&s;ts; if there be any one among you who is not in the mo&s;t unlimited and perfect Peace with all his Fellow-Citizens; if there be any Parents who are not tender of their Children; any Children who fail in Re&s;pect and Duty to their Parents; if there be here a tyrannical Hu&s;band, or abandoned Wife, begone; pre|&s;ume not to defile this holy Place with your unhallowed Steps; but hide your Heads in Darkne&s;s, veil your Eyes with Tears, clothe your Hearts with Mourning, and gird your</HI>

<P>Having thus &s;poke he retired, and the Congregation followed, again pro&s;trating them&s;elves upon entering the inner TEM|PLE. How plea&s;ing would it be, thought I, to &s;ee &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons upon Earth daring to approach their CREATOR, upon the &s;ame Principles, and under the &s;ame Re&s;trictions?

<P>DIVINE SERVICE now began, and con|tinued with &s;triking Solemnity near an Hour, the Congregation &s;ometimes pro|&s;trated, at others kneeling, and then &s;tanding.&mdash;Sitting is not allowed, it be|ing ob&s;erved, that if the NAMREDAL has &s;o much Re&s;pect paid him, as that none pre&s;ume to &s;it in his Pre&s;ence, it mu&s;t be deemed a mo&s;t unbecoming In&s;tance of Impiety to take that Freedom before HIM who is UNIVERSAL LORD and FA|THER of ALL.</P>

<P>The chief Points of it, &s;ays he, are, That they believe a &s;ingle undivided DIVINITY, inde&s;cribable, incomprehen|&s;ible, to who&s;e Appearance they adapt no Form, to who&s;e Attributes they pre|&s;cribe no Bounds: They never con&s;ider him as an angry, vindictive BEING; for That, according to their Notions, would be to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;ubject to Pa&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently imperfect: They &s;ay he be&s;tows from BENEVOLENCE, pardons from MERCY, and corrects from the &s;ame amiable Principles: That as by infinite WISDOM he knows all created Beings to
<PB N="111" REF="118">
be fallible, he will try them according to their Capacities and Opportunities: That he will not puni&s;h the Failings of real Weakne&s;s, nor reward untempted Rec|titude. To de&s;ign well, and to re&s;i&s;t Temptation con&s;titutes VIRTUE, as to act under Self-conviction, and to indulge pernicious Pa&s;&s;ions is of the E&s;&s;ence of VICE.</P>
<P>In this ISLAND it appears a mo&s;t &s;trange and partial Notion to fix one Place of Abode, one Degree of Puni&s;hment, and that eternal, for all Sinners. They be|lieve in and wor&s;hip a NALSINA, or ME|DIATOR, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be form|ed and appointed by GOD for the Sake of erring Creatures; that he is coeval with the Univer&s;e, for which, however, they do not fix an Aera, taking &s;uch a Di&s;qui&s;ition to be both unprofitable and pre&s;umptuous: That he has the Perfec|tions of a DEITY, except that he is liable
<PB N="112" REF="119">
to the Pa&s;&s;ions of Grief and Joy; the one cau&s;ed by ob&s;tinate Sinners, the other by contrite ones. The Rea&s;on they a&s;&s;ign for the Exi&s;tence and Belief of &s;uch a Me|diator is, that the pure undefiled E&s;&s;ence of DIVINITY being incompatible with the corrupt Breath of Sin, this Medium has been formed, that the NALSINA may more particularly &s;uperintend the Actions of Mortals, receive their Petitions, and &s;upplicate for them to the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P>Once each Day at lea&s;t every Per&s;on is obliged to attend public Wor&s;hip, and no &s;chi&s;matical Notions are allowed to be propagated; tho' every Man is at Libery to judge for him&s;elf, if he decently com|plies with e&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;toms; nor do they think that any Variation from thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sy&s;tem, if grounded upon pious Prin|ciples, will injure future Happine&s;s.

who are not naturalized, are indulged in pur&s;uing the Modes they practi&s;ed in their former Exi&s;tence, if it be agreeable to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, continued he, that the Grandeur of our TEMPLE &s;truck you; nor is it &s;urprizing in a Place where every other Building, except the HOUSE of JU|STICE, bears a &s;imple, unadorned, hum|ble Equality; but the NOIBLANS think it &s;erves to create a greater and more awful Re&s;pect to the DIVINITY to whom it is dedicated; it is to influence them&s;elves, not to gratify their GOD; for they are per&s;uaded that Works of Piety are as fra|grant, and of as much E&s;timation from the lowly Cottage as the mo&s;t towering Edi|fice.&mdash;How different is this Principle and Practice of the NOIBLANS from what I re|member to have ob&s;erv'd in <HI>England,</HI> where mo&s;t of the Noblemen's Stables are Build|ings &s;uperior to many of the Churches?</P>

<P><PB N="140" REF="147">
Here I confe&s;&s;ed that we have not at pre&s;ent, nor have had for &s;ome Years, one AUTHOR for the STAGE, that, in any Shape, de&s;erves the Name of POET; the TRAGEDIES are &s;uch cold, elaborate, un|alarming Pieces of Declamation, that no Action can give them Life, no Attention pur&s;ue them thro' five dull Acts: Indeed they boa&s;t of &s;trict critical Unities, and &s;ay that the Flowers of Poetry are de&s;ign|edly rejected, as improper for Dialogue; yet, were it not for &s;uch Pieces as abound in tho&s;e Flowers, and frequently break thro' the Trammels of CRITICISM, from which the THEATRES draw their chief Support, our modern Scribes would not have an Opportunity to crawl thro' nine dull Nights in their Pa&s;&s;age to Oblivion: Nay, I will do them the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, I believe that their &s;trict Attachment to Critici&s;m proceeds from its being better &s;uited to their barren Imaginations, which want Force and Activity to get beyond

its in&s;ipid Limits. In regard of their COMIC Pieces, as the Duke of BUCKING|HAM &s;aid, it was no ea&s;y Matter to pen a Whi&s;per, we find it now a ma&s;terly Point to pen a Blank; be&s;ides, it is made almo&s;t a con&s;tant Rule for one of the Interlocu|tors to begin &s;peaking before the other has done, which I always con&s;idered as a Piece of ill Manners. In &s;hort, there is &s;uch Snip&s;nap, &s;uch Pau&s;es, and He&s;ita|tion, that if Conver&s;ation in private was to take Example from what is exhibited on the STAGE, it would be reduced to a mo&s;t unmeaning, indelicate Stammering; a Labouring, like the Mountain, to bring forth a Mou&s;e.</P>
<P>What, &s;ays ELIZABETH, &s;uch a Depra|vity in a Country where SHAKESPEAR, DRYDEN, OTWAY, and CONGREVE have left &s;uch bright Examples! I am a&s;ham'd of my native Soil, and wi&s;h it had de&s;er|ved

<P>To this I replied, That, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, they had never been more encouraged, nor ever were wor&s;e &s;upported, than at pre&s;ent; the Incomes of Performers are immoderate, the Merit very confined. As to the former; why might not One hundred a-year, be&s;ides the Advantage of a Benefit, genteelly re|ward any Degree of Merit? By &s;uch a Re|gulation, &s;uch Savings might be made as would enable Managers to take more rea&s;onable Prices for &s;o rational and e&s;|&s;ential an Entertainment as the Drama affords: In this I would by no Means le&s;|&s;en the Con&s;equence or Credit of the Stage, for which no Per&s;on can have a greater Regard; but, by bringing it into le&s;s exceptionable Bounds, to guard it from the Envy and too ju&s;t Complaints which are now levelled again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150">
In regard of Performance; I have al|ways thought that the general Cour&s;e of Nature only can be a fit Standard of Ex|ample; every Character in private Life will be an unerring Original to copy for the Stage; only as Water-Colour Painting, which is &s;een at a Di&s;tance, and by artificial Light, requires &s;tronger Strokes than the Oil-&s;often'd Tints; &s;o Action upon the Stage &s;hould enforce and render its Origi|nal more &s;triking.&mdash;But how extremely different is the pre&s;ent Practice; in&s;tead of Nature, ONE eminent Performer, who has certainly a&s;toni&s;hing Abilities for his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, is &s;et up to View, and a &s;ervile, unequal Imitation of him glides thro' the various Degrees.

ever &s;aw, wherein an infinite Number of Flowers, Herbs, Shrubs, and Trees were delightfully variegated; &s;everal Birds, about the Size of our common Hens, were hovering round; their Plumage ap|peared charming beyond De&s;cription; their Heads were covered with a &s;hining Down of Golden Hue; their Wings ex|hibited the brighte&s;t Scarlet; their Necks vied with the Azure of the Firmament, and their Bodies &s;hamed the pure&s;t Snow: The&s;e I afterwards under&s;tood to be call|ed <HI>Do&s;en Alopu, Garden Birds,</HI> and that they are highly reverenced in NOIBLA for two Rea&s;ons; becau&s;e, fir&s;t, they de|&s;troy all the Vermin and In&s;ects that are pernicious to the Fruits of the Earth; and next, becau&s;e they are a Kind of na|tural Phy&s;icians; for when any NOIBLAN is indi&s;po&s;ed, as &s;ometimes is the Ca&s;e &s;lightly, he goes into his Garden, lies down on his Back, when the fir&s;t of the&s;e

<P>About half an Hour might have pa&s;&s;ed away in Ob&s;ervation before I heard any Body come, when the NAMREDAL'S Son approached with &s;ome Water in a Chry|&s;tal Ve&s;&s;el; which pre&s;enting with a fine Cloth, he told me that his Mother at|tended my coming to Breakfa&s;t; this oc|ca&s;ioned me to ha&s;ten; and, having wa&s;h|ed, I followed the Lad, who conducted me whither &s;he was.</P>
<P>She received me with mo&s;t delicate Affability, and kindly enquired whether

<P>Nay, Madam, &s;aid I, my Ta&s;te is ra|ther plain and unpoli&s;hed, any Thing will do for me; but, were I one of the nice&s;t Sort, Novelty would be a &s;trong Recommendation. Oh, how would Per|&s;ons

<P>As to LOVE, it has been well affirm'd by many eminent Authors, that it is the noble&s;t Feeling of the human Heart; noble when properly fix'd, and &s;upport|ed by a delicate Sincerity; dangerous when, at War with Rea&s;on, it captivates all our Intellects, and leads even our Sen&s;es to their own Delu&s;ion. I would endeavour to de&s;cribe the faire&s;t Side, and &s;hew di&s;intere&s;ted Affection in its pure&s;t Colours; but 'tis in vain to attempt a De&s;cription of that which &s;o rarely ex|i&s;ts among&s;t us; to find it in any Rank of People is almo&s;t a Miracle; Marriages indeed are negotiated, becau&s;e Nature and Cu&s;tom prompt the different Sexes to &s;uch Connections; but then they are tran&s;acted like any other Branch of Trade, and Money appears the chief Match-Maker; be&s;ides, as if we had not

<P>No, Madam, &s;ays I, 'tis of very late Date, and, as it did not affect me directly, I had forgot it. And pray, returns &s;he, how came it ever to be thought of? I re|plied that I never heard nor could ima|gine how &s;uch an Abortion was concei|ved;

<P>I told her that it was beyond my Power to account for it; that Beauty was fre|quently
<PB N="162" REF="169">
to be met with, and certainly had much Power; but that, among the polite World, one &s;carce knew what was Beauty, as the Fa&s;hions of Shapes and Features were &s;o often altered; &s;ome|times oval Faces are the Standard, then round ones; &s;ometimes broad Wai&s;ts, &s;ometimes narrow; &s;o that what is Beau|ty at one Time is Deformity at another; and Nature, who is not confined within the narrow Bounds of Rule, &s;uffers fre|quent and unde&s;erved Cen&s;ure from the ignorant Caprice of prevailing Opinion.</P>

<P>We were conducted by four-and-twenty Citizens, &s;ome of whom carried, as among us, the <HI>In&s;ignia</HI> of Authority immediately before the Magi&s;trate; the chief of which was three Figures in one Piece, mo&s;t admirably cut from a brilli|ant Stone or Compo&s;ition; the chief Fi|gure was JUSTICE; on her Right Hand appeared WISDOM &s;upporting her, and on the Left MERCY, (to whom &s;he kindly extends her Hand) kneeling in a &s;uppli|cative Po&s;ture. The Characters were &s;et forth with much the &s;ame Emblems as we &s;ee on Earth.</P>
<P>Having reached the Court, the NAM|REDAL placed me on the Left Hand of his own Seat, which I found to be a Mark of Di&s;tinction in NOIBLA. Two Citizens immediately approached, rai&s;ed

a Canopy over the Magi&s;trate, and then clo&s;ed him in, except on the Side where I &s;at, with &s;omewhat like a Silk Curtain; I wondered what the Meaning of this could be, but was &s;oon relieved from Su&s;pence; for he told me that, as the Eye was a Parent of Prejudice in almo&s;t every Point of View, and the be&s;t Under|&s;tanding or &s;ounde&s;t Judgment might be warped by it, the Cu&s;tom of NOIBLA was to veil the Magi&s;trate from Sight of tho&s;e who came to plead before him, till his Arbitration was determined; it has al&s;o, &s;ays he, the good Effect of keeping At|tention from being di&s;turbed by &s;ur|rounding Objects.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he had ended this Ob&s;ervation, a Citizen, with much emphatic Delibe|ration, repeated thrice the following Words:&mdash;<HI>Bineda, Oh</HI> NAMREDAL, <HI>Twanto Selben Twanta&s;tez.&mdash;Temper, Oh Fa|ther, Ju&s;tice with the Dew of Mercy.</HI> This

<P>Mo&s;t venerable Sir, replies the De|fendant, in whom dwells impartial Ju|&s;tice, to the Charge again&s;t me I plead In|nocence, which I hope to manife&s;t in few Words; TRUTH can never be Slander; our Laws, we all know, point out the Duties of our &s;everal Stations: This Woman, my Neighbour, who knows and is well able to perform all that can be re|quired of her, by an unu&s;ual Influence gained over her pliant Hu&s;band, has for &s;ome Time pa&s;t prevailed on him, toge|ther with his own Charge, to undertake &s;everal Concerns which properly fall un|der her's; by which Means gaining more vacant Time than any other Woman can command, &s;he has made it her Bu&s;ine&s;s to run from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, promoting Idlene&s;s by unprofitable Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="168" REF="175">
and making indu&s;trious Women unea&s;y by &s;neering at their commendable Appli|cation: Rou&s;ed to Re&s;entment by &s;uch Behaviour, I own I have &s;aid that her Hu&s;band &s;hows him&s;elf weak to be &s;o la|vi&s;h of Indulgence, and that &s;he proves her&s;elf highly unworthy of it by &s;uch Mi&s;application. This is the Extent of my Crime, if &s;uch it be, and to your Cle|mency I &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, con|&s;idered both from the Accu&s;ation and Defence, pronounces each Party equally guilty; you the ACCUSER, for &s;hameful|ly withdrawing from the Duties of a <HI>good Wife</HI> under the Shelter of a Hu&s;band's Fondne&s;s; and you, the ACCUSED, for being &s;o very forward to publi&s;h your Judgment upon an Affair which in no Shape came under your Cognizance. By what Authority are you the INSPECTOR of your Neighbours? You &s;hould be the

Friends, the Advi&s;ers, and not the Cen|&s;ors of each other; rather &s;tudious to conceal than forward to expo&s;e Failings of this Nature; but, &s;ince you are come here fraught with the Spirit of Conten|tion, hear your &s;everal Sentences.</P>

Agreement is preferable to Contention; that to correct our own Failings, to mind our own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to interfere with other People's Concerns, is the &s;ure&s;t Road to Quiet and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The Females being removed there ap|peared two Brothers, named EFFILAR and AITROTA; the former addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, &s;aid&mdash;AWFUL SIR, we are Bro|thers and Twins, not more intimately united by our Births than our Inclina|tions; yet as the Death of our Mother, as &s;oon almo&s;t as we were born, has left the Elder&s;hip doubtful, and as, without fix|ing this, we cannot make any legal Set|tlement of our Affairs, we humbly pre|&s;ent our&s;elves before your Wi&s;dom, and &s;upplicate Advice how we may &s;urmount the Difficulty; which is &s;till rendered more di&s;agreeable as we both love the &s;ame Female, but cannot prevail with
<PB N="171" REF="178">
her to declare in Favour of either till the Point in Debate is &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to determine, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, inform me, with the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed Truth, whether you &s;eek my Judgment from any View of Precedence ari&s;ing from Elder&s;hip, and whether to decide in Favour of one will create any Unea&s;ine&s;s in the other? Or whether, united by the tender and natu|ral Tie of brotherly Love, you &s;eek it &s;imply from the Motives you have men|tioned?&mdash;They replied, &s;olely from the Motives they had mentioned.</P>
<P>Well then, continus he, you &s;hall have my Opinion; but &s;ome Space of Con&s;i|deration will be requi&s;ite in &s;o new a Ca&s;e. In the mean Time, I mu&s;t let you know that there is a poor Man, who, by Accident, is rendered incapable of con|tributing his Share to the common Stock,
<PB N="172" REF="179">
wherefore he is in Danger of being re|moved from his Seat in the RUVENAL, the thought of which wounds him deep|ly; he has &s;ollicited Help from &s;everal, but found none; if you, or either of you, can &s;pare Time to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, it will be an Act of great Benevolence.</P>
<P>To this EFFILAR replied, VENERABLE FATHER, I could wi&s;h that I had the Power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, but my Hours are &s;o limited and &s;o fully employed, that the kind Wi&s;hes of Pity are all I can afford him.</P>
<P>Alas, replies AITROTA, when Affliction wounds, Wi&s;hes are but a poor and pain|ful Palliative, my Hours are limited and engaged al&s;o; yet, if to &s;pare one Half of what is allotted for my particular U&s;e can relieve him, I will mo&s;t gladly, Oh Father, let him have it.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">
Aye, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, then you have fully convinced me who is the elder; 'tis not a few Hours or a few Years that &s;hould place one Man before another; he who excells in Humanity, Benevolence, and &s;ocial Duties, de&s;erves the mo&s;t wor|thy Precedence; That, AITROTA, do thou enjoy, and exert thy&s;elf in Pity to thy Bro|ther; to enlarge his Heart, to &s;often his Feelings, and to create in him an Emula|tion of thy Goodne&s;s.&mdash;Here the Twins embraced, and he whom the NAMREDAL had &s;et a&s;ide, &s;eemed as well plea&s;ed as if the Deci&s;ion had been on his Part; only a con&s;cious Blu&s;h glow'd on his Cheek at the ju&s;t and gentle Rebuke of the Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>As they were on the Point of depart|ing, the NAMREDAL &s;aid, Hold, I re|member you told me that one Female had engaged the Affection of both, but that the Doubt of Elder&s;hip prevented her from accepting either: This appears
<PB N="174" REF="181">
to me a Proof that &s;he is unworthy, and that &s;he &s;eeks to gratify Pride more than Love; therefore let me advi&s;e you to bring her before me, and I'll negotiate, if po&s;&s;ible, to your mutual Satisfaction; but take Heed not to mention the Deter|mination I have made. This Propo&s;al was joyfully accepted, and EFFILAR went immediately to bring the Dam&s;el; with whom in a few Moments he return'd, when the NAMREDAL &s;poke thus to her:</P>
<P>Virtuous Maid, here are two Brothers, both, I under&s;tand, Suitors of yours; they have agreed, before me, to abide by your free and unbia&s;&s;ed Choice; &s;ay then, whether you will become the Wife of EFFILAR, now in Court confirmed the Elder, or throw your&s;elf into the Arms of AITROTA, the Younger? (in &s;aying of which he rever&s;ed them) the Girl, with|out any He&s;itation, fixed upon EFFILAR; when the Magi&s;trate, having made her
<PB N="175" REF="182">
repeat the Choice three or four Times, and declare that Love only &s;wayed her, he informed her of the Deceit, and that in Reality &s;he had cho&s;en the younge&s;t; upon which her Colour went thro' a Va|riety of Changes, and &s;he appeared in the mo&s;t painful Confu&s;ion; which the NAM|REDAL perceiving, for now the Curtain was drawn from before him, he cried out, with unu&s;ual Severity,&mdash;Thou Shame to the NOIBLAN Race; thou poor unhappy Slave of Pride, unworthy and ignorant of that pure aethereal Flame which di&s;inte|re&s;ted Love beams into the Heart; how could&s;t thou be &s;o blind to thy own Hap|pine&s;s, and cruel to that of another, as to have thy choice directed by &s;o fal&s;e a Me|teor as Vanity? Fly, begone, worthle&s;s as thou art, from the Comforts and Plea&s;ures of Society, that thou may'&s;t not again have the Opportunity to impo&s;e a worth|le&s;s Heart, through Recommendation of a lovely Form; I bani&s;h thee for five
<PB N="176" REF="183">
RAYAMONS to OMYRCHAL, at the End of which Time thou may'&s;t return, but ne|ver to enter the honourable State of Mar|riage; bring forth, &s;ays he, the Garment and Veil of Mourning, in which that ad|ventitious Merit, on which &s;he prides her&s;elf &s;o much, may be immediately ob|&s;cured.</P>
<P>At this dreadful Sentence the &s;elf-be|tray'd Female fainted away; the Brothers could not avoid a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, nor even &s;hedding Tears; yet, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, Sen|tence once pa&s;&s;ed is irrevocable, and how|ever they might lament her Fate, all al|lowed it to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Mercy deliver us, thought I, what a deal of Bani&s;hment we &s;hould have in ENGLAND if &s;uch a Law was to take Place; whole Swarms of the pretty, &s;prightly, fluttering Animals called CO|QUETTES would be &s;wept away, to the

<P>This Reverie would, in all Probabi|lity, have extended it&s;elf to a con&s;idera|ble Length, but that I was rou&s;ed by a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e ari&s;ing from the Approach of two Di&s;putants, one of whom I recol|lected to be my old Friend BEAU NASH; the other, in Appearance, I knew nothing of.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e you, Sir, I was e&s;teem|ed upon Earth a very con&s;iderable Per&s;onage; 'tis true I am in the MOON at pre&s;ent; but no Matter for that, I was MASTER of the CEREMONIES at a Place called BATH: Indeed they u&s;ed to &s;tile me KING of it; and, tho' I am no CITI|ZEN here, I ruled all the CITIZENS there; nay, &s;colded Ladies, cut Jokes upon Lords, directed Balls, be&s;poke Plays, and did&mdash;in &s;hort I did what I plea&s;ed: The Corporation idolized, the Long-Rooms reverenced, the Coffee-Hou&s;es adored me: I had my STATUE &s;et up in the PUMP-ROOM, not a good Likene&s;s; but no Matter for that,&mdash;I was always a great Enemy to Quarrels, and therefore never &s;uffer'd a Sword to be drawn in my Territories; &s;o not knowing there would
<PB N="179" REF="186">
be any Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Implements in another World, I came hither quite un|provided; which this grim old ROMAN being acquainted with, took the Advan|tage of &s;uperior Strength, and Ye&s;terday pulled me by the No&s;e all round the SALMINA RUVENAL, &s;purring me on every &s;ix or eight Yards with a &s;evere Kick, which I think very Ungentleman|like Treatment, and I hope you will think &s;o too, that he may be corrected for it.</P>
<P>The familiar Nothingne&s;s of this Speech occa&s;ioned a general Smile thro' the Au|dience, and I ob&s;erved that even the NAMREDAL had &s;ome Difficulty to com|mand his Mu&s;cles; however, Rea&s;on and the Dignity of his Office checking other Feelings, he took Occa&s;ion to remark, that neither of the Parties being natura|lized, nor any Law provided in NOIBLA again&s;t &s;uch violent Proceedings, the Ju|&s;tice to be adapted in this Ca&s;e mu&s;t lie en|tirely

upon his Judgment, which he would admini&s;ter with all po&s;&s;ible Impartiality: For this Purpo&s;e he de&s;ired the Defend|ant to offer his Negative, or Palliation.</P>
<P>The Accu&s;ed, who was no le&s;s than the great CATO, delivered him&s;elf to the fol|lowing Effect: SAGE SON OF JUSTICE AND LAW, to be Competitor or Di&s;pu|tant with &s;uch a Thing as now &s;tands be|fore me, is Puni&s;hment equal to the high|e&s;t Crime; yet unworthy, and far beneath my Notice as he is, I &s;hall enter into an Account of my Conduct, which has di&s;|covered no Fault but that of too much Mildne&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;elf-blown Bubble has, in tracing him&s;elf, &s;ufficiently &s;hewn his Emptine&s;s and In&s;ignificance; nor will it avail much to &s;et the paltry Portrait in more glaring Colours than that he &s;pent a Life of Four|&s;core Years in a motley Mixture of Vice,

Idlene&s;s, Foppery, and ridiculous Autho|rity; the Je&s;t of &s;en&s;ible Men, the Com|panion of Sharpers, and Terror of dan|cing Girls; laughed at in Youth, and de|&s;pi&s;ed in Age.</P>
<P>How different from this the Race I run? My early Years employed in the Cultivation of my Mind; tho&s;e of ripen'd Manhood worn, as I may &s;ay, in &s;tem|ming the Torrent of Faction;&mdash;there view a &s;kipping Child of Folly&mdash;here be|hold a di&s;intere&s;ted Son of LIBERTY;&mdash;and &s;hall&mdash;Oh Heavens&mdash;this In&s;ect, not two Degrees above mere In&s;tinct, becau&s;e we are met in a Region where ju&s;t Di|&s;tinctions cea&s;e, dare to mate him&s;elf with CATO uncha&s;ti&s;ed? No, let it not be &s;aid. Rou&s;ed by his biting Taunts, I own I did treat him in the Manner he has &s;et forth; nor can I think unju&s;tly; yet if Fortune, which has pur&s;ued me even hither with her Frowns, continues to torment me, I

cannot avoid her Malice, and therefore mu&s;t endure it.</P>
<P>This Reply being concluded, in which may be di&s;covered as much of Stoical Pride as the other &s;hewed of Foppi&s;h Self-&s;ufficiency, the NAMREDAL di&s;cu&s;&s;ed their Ca&s;e in the following Manner:</P>
<P>It is amazing that, in this Region of Tranquillity, neither Example nor the Fear of Di&s;grace, which is the mo&s;t poignant Sting of all Puni&s;hment, can re|duce Sublunars from that turbulent Spirit &s;o prevalent among&s;t them.&mdash;You, NASH, continues he, who boa&s;t of having been &s;o many Years Conductor of public Man|ners, ought to know better than to break untimely Je&s;ts upon a Man &s;o much more eminent than you ever could pretend to be; notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e who think them&s;elves Wits on Earth may indulge a &s;uppo&s;ed Privilege of ca&s;ting their Darts

Your Accu&s;er &s;ets forth his own Character ju&s;t|ly, without throwing any Sarca&s;ms upon yours; he betrayed Pride, but then it is of the inoffen&s;ive Kind.&mdash;On the con|trary, you have endeavoured to mount your&s;elf on his poor Ruins; you have carefully dimini&s;hed him, and o&s;tenta|tiou&s;ly magnified your&s;elf; tho' a Man of your Reflection mu&s;t know that the great|e&s;t Merit vani&s;hes before Self-prai&s;e, like Chaff before the Wind: Be&s;ides, you have enviou&s;ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed one mo&s;t amiable Part of his Character, an indu&s;trious, un|limited Di&s;po&s;ition to Charity, which mu&s;t have reached your Ears as well as other

Points relating to him.&mdash;You boa&s;t of Philo&s;ophy; how comes it that, &s;o armed, you could not re&s;train your&s;elf from Blows, and &s;uffer his In&s;ignificance to pa&s;s unheeded? But the Pa&s;&s;ion of ungovern|able Pride which intoxicated you on Earth, &s;till vi&s;ibly prevails, tho' you have &s;o often felt its bad Effects; in this Ca&s;e I cannot avoid pa&s;&s;ing upon you the fol|lowing Sentence: That, after NASH has performed his Pennance, you &s;hall be obliged to keep him Company for two RAYAMONS; when, by my Authrity, he may talk as much, as loud, as fa&s;t, and vent as keen a Ridicule as he plea&s;es, being at Liberty once each TOIRTA to claim the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his A&s;&s;ociates CIBBER and RICH.</P>
<P>The&s;e Names made the Stoic &s;hudder; but knowing the Matter was unavoid|able, he collected what Re&s;olution he could to carry off Appearances, and floun|ced

out of COURT with a Look of inef|fable Contempt, while CAESAR and POM|PEY, who had been li&s;tening from a Cor|ner to the whole Tran&s;action, indulged their Mirth very freely on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The next Complaint was a Charge of Ingratitude preferred by one Man again&s;t another, in which the Plaintiff &s;et forth, That he had, upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted the Defendant; that he had been indu&s;trious to oblige him, notwith&s;tand|ing which, continues he, forgetting the Feelings every hone&s;t Man &s;hould have for Favours received, he has taken the fir&s;t Opportunity of &s;hewing him&s;elf my Enemy.</P>
<P>What, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, is it po&s;|&s;ible? Can there in NOIBLA be &s;uch a Wretch? INGRATITUDE, the very Men|tion of a Temper &s;o di&s;graceful to the rea&s;onable Nature, provokes our Indig|nation.

Shall Bea&s;ts of the Field ca&s;t off their Wildne&s;s, and enter into a grateful kind Intimacy with their Keeper?

<P>I have confe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf indebted for Favours received; but how far the Obli|gation was dimini&s;hed by my Benefactor's public boa&s;ting of his Kindne&s;s to me, at &s;everal different Times and Places, I &s;ub|mit, Oh NAMREDAL, to your impartial Determination: Notwith&s;tanding this, my Feelings were not le&s;&s;en'd, nor would I have neglected any proper Te&s;timonies of Thankfulne&s;s.

Mo&s;t certainly, replies the NAMREDAL; are Acts of Friend&s;hip to take the Place of Bribes? Mu&s;t Truth and Ju&s;tice be &s;acrificed to them?

Be&s;ides, continues he, applying to the Plaintiff, thy mean Pro|clamation of thy Bounty not only dimi|ni&s;hes, but even annihilates all Obliga|tion; had&s;t thou exerted it merely to &s;erve thy Friend, the &s;ilent delicate Plea|&s;ure of doing it would have &s;ufficed thee; but O&s;tentation was the Principle, and being de&s;titute of Virtue, it is fit thou &s;hou'd&s;t be de&s;titute of Reward for the&s;e Rea&s;ons; and more particularly for im|peaching the Character of thy Fellow-Citizen, I con&s;ider thee as a Criminal, and &s;hall &s;entence thee to act as his Ser|vant three REAPANS, and once each TOIRTA to make a public Acknowledge|ment of thy Guilt in the RUVENAL, &s;ol|liciting his Forgivene&s;s.</P>

Here the Defendant earne&s;tly implo|red a Remi&s;&s;ion of the Sentence, remark|ing that it would be as painful to him as to the condemn'd Per&s;on; and that he was certain this public Repul&s;e would correct that Impatience of Di&s;po&s;ition which led him into Error.&mdash;Well, &s;ays the NAMREDAL, I yield to thy humane and generous Sollicitation, which, for ma|licious Pro&s;ecution, returns the gentle Balm of Mercy: Depart full of that Sa|tisfaction a generous Heart mu&s;t fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> from alleviating or averting Di&s;tre&s;s; and thou, unworthy Object of this Goodne&s;s, endeavour, by a zealous Reformation, to de&s;erve &s;o valuable a Friend.</P>
<P>The next Subject of Judicial Con&s;ide|ration, which came before the NAMRE|DAL, was an Accu&s;ation again&s;t a young Man for uttering &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in|con&s;i&s;tent with Mode&s;ty before a Com|pany of Females: As he acknowledged

the Circum&s;tances at large, and re&s;ted his Cau&s;e on the Clemency of the Court, nothing more pa&s;&s;ed but the following Remarks made, and Sentence pa&s;&s;ed by the Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou not been taught&mdash;Oh in|con&s;iderate Youth&mdash;that MODESTY &s;hould be held ever &s;acred? That it is the Shield of Virtue, and, if once penetrated by the Stings of Vice, &s;carce admits Re|pair? Like Snow it di&s;covers the &s;malle&s;t Speck that chances to light upon it, and as that watry Con&s;i&s;tence melts away before the Sun, &s;o MODESTY vani&s;hes before the Heat of inordinate Pa&s;&s;ions, or even Words expre&s;&s;ive of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Would&s;t thou pre&s;erve Purity in Feed|ing, and yet defile thy Mouth with im|pure Language? Ha&s;t thou no more Re|gard for Society than to vent &s;uch perni|cious Poi&s;on? Will it plea&s;e thee to breathe Infection that may bla&s;t the Ro&s;es

of Beauty? Art thou endowed with Rea|&s;on to make it an In&s;trument of Good or Evil? If of Good, how can&s;t thou employ it to wound the tender and delicate Ear of VIRTUE? If of Evil, like tho&s;e veno|mous and nau&s;eous Animals, which are equally dangerous and loath&s;ome, thou &s;hould&s;t be &s;hunn'd and excluded from Society.</P>
<P>Thus much I have &s;poke, if Shame be not dead in thee, to rou&s;e it. What re|mains for me is to pa&s;s the Sentence e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by Law for &s;uch Offences; which is, that barefooted, with thy Head un|covered, and the Words, <HI>Retho e&s;ol na it|&s;edom,&mdash;A Foe to Mode&s;ty,</HI>&mdash;on thy Brea&s;t; thou art to be publickly led thro' NOD|NOL &s;ix Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and afterwards in the &s;ame Manner thro' every ARESAL in the whole I&s;land of NOIBLA; during which Space thou art disfranchi&s;ed from all thy Rights and Privileges as a Citizen.</P>

After this a grave Man and a young Female made their Appearance, and the Man &s;poke to this Effect: I am, VENE|RABLE NAMREDAL, Father of this young Woman now brought before you, and in that Relation have always exerted my tendere&s;t Care, as well from natural Af|fection as from the Principle of parental Duty; I have not only &s;tudiou&s;ly culti|vated her Mind, which I have found mo&s;t apt and teachable, but I have al&s;o, upon all Occa&s;ions, allowed her every prudent Indulgence; like a delicate and beauteous Flower &s;he has flouri&s;hed un|der my Care, yet it grieves me to add that, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, &s;he has con|ducted her&s;elf in a Manner very contra|dictory to my Opinion, which I take to ari&s;e from an Intimacy &s;he has contracted with a Female lately arrived from the nether World. By our In&s;titutions all Women are dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Kind of
<PB N="194" REF="201">
Materials, therefore &s;he cannot have Va|riety of Garments, yet has &s;he an infinite Number of what &s;he calls FASHIONS; &s;ometimes long Sleeves, &s;ometimes &s;hort; &s;ometimes Wings as if &s;he was going to fly, then bare as an unfeather'd Pinion; &s;ometimes a Tail &s;weeping the Ground, then &s;o much curtail'd that half her Legs may be &s;een; be&s;ides which, tho' I have often pointed out agreeable Partners for Marriage, &s;he puts me off with &s;aying &s;he cannot give up her Liberty yet; that &s;uch a one is not hand&s;ome enough; that another is not witty; a third has no Spi|rits, and many other &s;uch-like trifling Eva&s;ions; notwith&s;tanding which &s;he is never ea&s;y but when flaunting with Men: This I have often remon&s;trated again&s;t, but to no Purpo&s;e; and of late &s;he has had the Confidence to tell me that Men in Years were no Judges of what was fit for young Women; wherefore, Oh FA|THER
<PB N="195" REF="202">
of NODNOL, I have brought her hither for your Wi&s;dom and Authority to influence.</P>
<P>Aye, replies the NAMREDAL, have we Di&s;obedience and a Contempt of parental Power creeping in among&s;t us? If &s;o, adieu to Order, Peace, Virtue, and &s;o|cial Happine&s;s.&mdash;Pray, young Madam, how have you ventured to depart &s;o far from the Obligations of Nature and the &s;trict Laws of this I&s;land? If you have any Apology, any Plea, make it, and I &s;hall attend.</P>
<P>The poor Girl, covered with extreme Confu&s;ion, had &s;carce Power to utter the following broken Sentences; that &s;he lo|ved her Father very well, and had a great Plea&s;ure in obeying him, but that the COUNTESS of&mdash;, (her Title is omitted in Re&s;pect of &s;ome living) lately arrived from ENGLAND, told her, Fathers were

&s;uch chuff Fellows, who would not wil|lingly allow their Children any Plea&s;ures; that no Girl of Spirit &s;hould mind them; that if &s;he married it would cut of all Ad|mirers; that by keeping Company with different Men &s;he would have a better Choice; and that making Cloaths in va|rious FASHIONS would &s;et her off to more Advantage.</P>
<P>A very hopeful Account, truly, &s;ays the Magi&s;trate, and for all this &s;en&s;ible, kind In&s;truction you are indebted to the COUNTESS. Upon my Word it would be great Pity, and reflect upon us much Di&s;grace, if &s;o public-&s;pirited a Lady, who would reform our Manners, teach us Elegance for Simplicity, and Spirit for Prudence, &s;hould go unrewarded; wherefore, Oh ye Citizens, you who this Day give Force to Law, take Notice that I &s;entence the &s;aid COUNTESS, without Hope of Redemption, to the VALLEY of
<PB N="197" REF="204">
WEEPING; there let her expatiate on Ta&s;te; there let her di&s;play fa&s;hionable Knowledge; there &s;et up the vain Idols of her frantic Brain.</P>
<P>As for you, young Daughter, conti|nued the NAMREDAL, who have been led a&s;tray thro' Inexperience, I &s;hall endea|vour to inform you better, by remarking upon each Particular of what you have &s;aid; this the Duty of the Magi&s;terial Office requires, and my Duty is enforced by tho&s;e tender and &s;ympathetic Feelings which urge us to guard or re&s;cue natural Innocence from artificial Guilt.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, as to the Love of your Fa|ther; I grant it may be affectionate, but it cannot be truly filial or perfect without an unlimited Obedience to his Authority, and an implicit Compliance with his Pre|cepts; which, you may be &s;atisfied, are both exerted to promote your Welfare
<PB N="198" REF="205">
and Happine&s;s. I know that he and you view Things in a very different Light, as Age and Youth ever do; the Vivacity of the latter, like an impatient Cour&s;er, &s;truggles for the full and dangerous Stretch of natural Liberty, while the for|mer is making. U&s;e of the prudential Check-Rein of Re&s;traint.&mdash;Con&s;ider, Age &s;ees Actions and Circum&s;tances in their true Shape, and di&s;cerns what Con|&s;equences they lead on to; while Youth, looking through Pa&s;&s;ion-tainted Optics, views them colour'd according to their Fancy and their Wi&s;h; hence therefore the Opinions and Advice of experienced Elders, of Parents e&s;pecially, &s;hould be allowed all due Influence.</P>
<P>Your Choice in Marriage is, by the Laws of the I&s;land, undoubtedly free, and Rea&s;on &s;anctifies tho&s;e Laws, there|fore in this Point you have no Compul|&s;ion to fear; but Freedom is not in|fringed
<PB N="199" REF="206">
by the cordial Advice of tho&s;e who have your Pro&s;perity at Heart. As to the idle Notion of lo&s;ing Liberty and Admirers by taking a Hu&s;band, nothing can be more ab&s;urd; true Liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in a licentious Indulgence of Follies and Pro&s;titution of Time, but in an uncontrouled, voluntary, prudent Pur|&s;uit of Virtue and dome&s;tic Happine&s;s, to which the very Name of Admirers is a Bane, I mean Admirers of external Charms only; for of tho&s;e who admire the unfading Beauties of the Mind, who can gain more than &s;he who di&s;tingui&s;hes her|&s;elf by the eminent and mo&s;t amiable Title of <HI>A good Wife?</HI> She has number|le&s;s Opportunities of commanding Prai&s;e, which the &s;ingle State affords not; in that Character are comprized &s;uch invincible Charms as brave the Attacks of Sorrow, Pain, Sickne&s;s, and even Death it&s;elf; the Matrimonial Union collects into a Train of uniform, &s;olid, and la&s;ting Enjoyment,
<PB N="200" REF="207">
that Happine&s;s which in Celibacy is dif|fu&s;ed variable and imperfect.</P>
<P>By a&s;&s;ociating with a Variety of Gal|lants you think Power and Choice en|larged; it may be &s;o, but then it becomes dangerous, &s;ince nothing can be more prejudicial to the Character of a young Woman, nothing more repugnant to Prudence; and tho' it be not an ab&s;olute Violation of Virtue, yet is it a great Ble|mi&s;h in her Reputation, for even Appear|ances of what is wrong &s;hould be avoid|ed; in the Eye of Rea&s;on the Pro&s;titution of the Mind, which certainly leads to it, is little le&s;s offen&s;ive than the Pro&s;titution of the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the Variation of Fa&s;hion, which is in it&s;elf childi&s;h, it may po&s;&s;ibly add &s;omewhat to Attraction of Features; nor would there be any great Matter of Of|fence in it, but for the Time it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="201" REF="208">
engro&s;s, and the unprofitable Emulation it mu&s;t create of outvying each other in Trifles, when all our Con|te&s;t &s;hould be to gain an honourable Di|&s;tinction in the Race of public and pri|vate Virtues.&mdash;Dre&s;&s;ing to draw Admirers is one of the poore&s;t Baits of Folly; Neat|ne&s;s is agreeable to Rea&s;on and Nature, and equally e&s;&s;ential to Maid and Wife; more is at be&s;t but idle Superfluity.</P>
<P>Lock up the&s;e Remarks, fair Daugh|ter, in your Heart; think not that, being grave, they are &s;evere; entertain a grate|ful Remembrance of your Father's kind Attention to your Welfare; give Heed to his Advice, Obedience to his Commands, and on &s;uch Conditions I will not only free you from Puni&s;hment, but even from Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, the Father re|verently made Obei&s;ance to him, and the
<PB N="202" REF="209">
Girl returned &s;ilent Thanks in Tears of penitent Joy. So terminated the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Day; when the NAMREDAL, de&s;cending from his Judgment-Seat, con|ducted me, thro' the attending Citizens, to the Dining-Hall; when &s;eated, he a&s;k+ed me how I liked their Court of Judica|ture, which occa&s;ioned me to break out into a rapturous Exclamation: Happy! &s;upremely happy NOIBLANS! among whom Ju&s;tice appears in her own un|adorned, mode&s;t, native Dignity, not ar|ray'd in the Fool's Coat of Tricks and Equivocation: Where the Magi&s;trate is indeed a Parent of the People; where un|incumber'd Rea&s;on takes its free Cour&s;e without pa&s;&s;ing through the Windings and inextricable Confu&s;ion of Sophi&s;try; where Innocence and Guilt are contra&s;ted with judicious Impartiality; where Riches, Rank, or Power, never appear to influ|ence; but where the calm determined Voice of Equity, &s;peaking with the Or|gans
<PB N="203" REF="210">
of Truth, not only impre&s;&s;es Con|viction, but even commands Approba|tion from tho&s;e who receive Cen&s;ure or Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed, replies the NAM|REDAL, that you con&s;ider this Part of the NOIBLAN In&s;titution in the &s;ame Light as I do; other Peculiarities which you have met with &s;ince your Arrival in the&s;e Regi|ons, I know cannot &s;o well &s;uit the active Spirit of a SUBLUNAR Being.&mdash;There is a general and amiable Tranquillity here, but then it is founded upon Principles which entirely re&s;train progre&s;&s;ive Knowledge; all here think them&s;elves &s;ufficiently wi&s;e, &s;ufficiently happy; they &s;eek to know no more than they are already acquainted with, nor to po&s;&s;e&s;s any Thing better than what their Fathers have enjoyed: This will appear to you a mental Lethar|gy, and undoubtedly it is &s;uch; but many
<PB N="204" REF="211">
Advantages accrue from &s;uch a Mode of thinking, which are in them&s;elves &s;o evi|dent that I need not point them out, e&s;pecially as you will next Week have an Opportunity of hearing &s;omewhat more at large upon this Topic, when all the NAMREDALS of the I&s;land come to their annual Conference at NODNOL.</P>
<P>The MOUNT of OBSERVATION, the VALLEY of WEEPING, the ESTRALAM, NEROMA, with other Subjects worthy of Ob&s;ervation, will afford you Matter of very agreeable and not unu&s;eful Speculation.</P>
<P>Here the BELL of NOON gave Warn|ing for Dinner, and interrupted a Con|ver&s;ation which would probably have ex|tended it&s;elf to a con&s;iderable Length. Here al&s;o, kind Readers, after conver&s;ing and travelling &s;o far together, I hope on friendly Terms, you will think it fit that,
<PB N="205" REF="212">
for a while at lea&s;t, we &s;hould part: If you are inclined to accompany me any farther in this extraordinary Progre&s;s, I &s;hall attend your Call, and in the mean Time I bid you heartily farewell.</P>
