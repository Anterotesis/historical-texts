<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all kinds of &s;atire, there is none &s;o entertaining, and univer&s;ally im|proving, as that which is intro|duced, as it were, occa&s;ionally, in the cour&s;e of an intere&s;ting &s;tory, which brings every incident home to life; and by repre&s;enting familiar &s;cenes in an uncommon and amu&s;ing point of view, inve&s;ts them with all the graces of novelty, while nature is appealed to in every particular.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">
The reader gratifies his curio&s;ity, in pur|&s;uing the adventures of a per&s;on in who&s;e favour he is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; he e&s;pou&s;es his cau&s;e, he &s;ympathizes with him in di&s;tre&s;s, his indignation is heated again&s;t the authors of his calamity; the humane pa&s;&s;ions are inflamed; the contra&s;t between dejected virtue, and in&s;ulting vice, appears with greater aggravation, and every impre&s;&s;ion having a double force on the imagination, the memory retains the circum&s;tance, and the heart improves by the example. The attention is not tired with a bare Catalogue of characters, but agreeably diverted with all the variety of invention; and the vici&s;|&s;itudes of life appear in their peculiar cir|cum&s;tances, opening an ample field for wit and humour.</P>
<P>Romance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity and &s;uper&s;tition. In the dark ages of the world, when a man had rendered him&s;elf famous for wi&s;dom or va|lour,
<PB N="v" REF="5">
his family and adherents availed them|&s;elves of his &s;uperior qualities, magnified his virtues, and repre&s;ented his character and per&s;on as &s;acred and &s;upernatural. The vulgar ea&s;ily &s;wallowed the bait, im|plored his protection, and yielded the tribute of homage and prai&s;e even to adoration; his exploits were handed down to po&s;terity with a thou&s;and exaggerations; they were repeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars erected to his memory, for the encouragement of tho&s;e who attempted to imitate his example; and hence aro&s;e the heathen mythology, which is no other than a collection of ex|travagant Romances.&mdash;As learning ad|vanced, and genius received cultivation, the&s;e &s;tories were embelli&s;hed with the graces of poetry, that they might the bet|ter recommend them&s;elves to the attention; they were &s;ung in publick, at fe&s;tivals, for the in&s;truction and delight of the audience; and rehear&s;ed before battle, as incentives to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
epic mu&s;e were born, and, in the progre&s;s of ta&s;te, arrived at perfection.&mdash;It is no wonder, that the ancients could not reli&s;h a fable in pro&s;e, after they had &s;een &s;o many remarkable events celebrated in ver&s;e, by their be&s;t poets; we therefore, find no romance among them, during the aera of their excellence, unle&s;s the Cyropaedia of Zenophon may be &s;o called; and it was not till arts and &s;ciences began to revive, after the irruption of the Barbarians into Europe, that any thing of this kind ap|peared. But when the minds of men were debauched by the impo&s;ition of prie&s;t-craft to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd pitch of credulity; the authors of romance aro&s;e, and lo&s;ing &s;ight of probability, filled their performances with the mo&s;t mon&s;trous hyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius, they were re&s;olved to excel them in fiction, and apply to the wonder rather than the judgment of their readers. Ac|cordingly they brought negromancy to their aid, and in&s;tead of &s;upporting the character
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
of their heroes, by dignity of &s;entiment and practice, di&s;tingui&s;hed them by their bodily &s;trength, activity and extravagance of behaviour. Although nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural than the figures they drew, they did not want pa|trons and admirers, and the world actually began to be infected with the &s;pirit of knight-errantry, when Cervantes, by an in|imitable piece of ridicule, reformed the ta&s;te of mankind, repre&s;enting chivalry in the right point of view, and converting romance to purpo&s;es far more u&s;eful and en|tertaining, by making it a&s;&s;ume the &s;ock, and point out the follies of ordinary life.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method has been practi&s;ed by other Spani&s;h and French authors, and by none more &s;ucce&s;sfully than by Mon&s;ieur Le Sage, who in his adventures of Gil Blas, has de&s;cribed the knavery and foibles of life, with infinite humour and &s;agacity.&mdash;The following &s;heets I have modelled on his plan, taking the liberty, however, to
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
differ from him in the execution, where I thought his particular &s;ituations were un|common, extravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the &s;cene is laid.&mdash;The di&s;graces of Gil Blas, are for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch as rather excite mirth than com|pa&s;&s;ion; he him&s;elf laughs at them; and his tran&s;itions from di&s;tre&s;s to happine&s;s, or at lea&s;t ea&s;e, are &s;o &s;udden, that neither the reader has time to pity him, nor him&s;elf to be acquainted with affliction.&mdash;This con|duct, in my opinion, not only deviates from probability, but prevents that gene|rous indignation, which ought to animate the reader, again&s;t the &s;ordid and vicious di&s;po&s;ition of the world.</P>
<P>I have attempted to repre&s;ent mode&s;t merit &s;truggling with every difficulty to which a friendle&s;s orphan is expo&s;ed, from his own want of experience, as well as from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, malice, and ba&s;e in|difference of mankind.&mdash;To &s;ecure a fa|vourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I have allowed him the advantages of birth and education,
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
which in the &s;eries of his misfortunes, will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warm|ly in his behalf; and though I fore&s;ee, that &s;ome people will be offended at the mean &s;cenes in which he is involved, I per&s;uade my&s;elf the judicious will not only perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;cribing tho&s;e &s;ituations to which he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be confined, in his low e&s;tate; but al&s;o find entertainment in viewing tho&s;e parts of life, where the humours and pa&s;&s;ions are undi&s;gui&s;ed by af|fectation, ceremony, or education; and the whim&s;ical peculiarities of di&s;po&s;ition ap|pear as nature has implanted them.&mdash;But I believe I need not trouble my&s;elf in vindi|cating a practice authorized by the be&s;t writers in this way, &s;ome of whom I have already named.</P>
<P>Every intelligent reader will, at fir&s;t &s;ight, perceive I have not deviated from nature, in the facts, which are all true in the main, although the circum&s;tances are
<PB N="x" REF="10">
altered and di&s;gui&s;ed to avoid per&s;onal &s;a|tire.</P>
<P>It now remains, to give my rea&s;ons for making the chief per&s;onage of this work a North-Briton; which are chiefly the&s;e: I could at a &s;mall expence be&s;tow on him &s;uch education as I thought the dignity of his birth and character required, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be obtained in England, by &s;uch &s;lender means as the nature of my plan would afford. In the next place, I could repre&s;ent &s;implicity of manners in a remote part of the kingdom, with more propriety, than in any place near the capi|tal; and la&s;tly, the di&s;po&s;ition of the Scots, addicted to travelling, ju&s;tifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that coun|try.</P>
<P>That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning oaths which proceed from the mouths of &s;ome per&s;ons in the&s;e memoirs, I beg leave to premi&s;e,
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
that I imagined nothing could more effec|tually expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch mi&s;erable expletives, than a natural and verbal re|pre&s;entation of the di&s;cour&s;e with which they are commonly interlarded.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of my birth and parentage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS born in the northern part of this united kingdom in the hou&s;e of my grandfather, a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune and influ|ence, who had on many occa&s;ions &s;ignalized him|&s;elf in behalf of his country; and was remarka|ble for his abilities in the law, which he exerci&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, in quality of a judge, particu|larly again&s;t beggars, for whom he had a &s;ingu|lar aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>My father, his younge&s;t &s;on, &s;ell in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentle|man, and performed the office of hou&s;e-keeper; whom he privately e&s;pou&s;ed; of which marriage I am the fir&s;t fruit.&mdash;During her pregnancy, a dream di&s;compo&s;ed my mother &s;o much, that my
<PB N="2" REF="24">
father, tired with her importunity, at la&s;t con&s;ulted a &s;eer, who&s;e favourable interpretation he would have &s;ecured before-hand by a bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed, &s;he was de|livered of a tennis-ball, which the devil (who to her great &s;urprize, acted the part of a midwife) &s;truck &s;o forcibly with a racket, that it di&s;ap|peared in an in&s;tant; and &s;he was for &s;ome time incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of her off-&s;pring; when all of a &s;udden, &s;he beheld it return with equal violence, and earth it&s;elf beneath her feet, whence immediately &s;prung up a goodly tree covered with blo&s;&s;oms, the &s;cent of which operated &s;o &s;trongly on her nerves that &s;he awoke.&mdash;The attentive &s;age, after &s;ome deliberation, a&s;&s;ured my parents, that their fir&s;t-born would be a great traveller, that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at la&s;t return to his native land, where he would flouri&s;h with great reputation and happi|ne&s;s.&mdash;How truly this was foretold, will appear in the &s;equel.&mdash;It was not long before &s;ome of|ficious per&s;on informed my grandfather of fami|liarities that pa&s;&s;ed between his &s;on and hou&s;e|keeper, which alarmed him &s;o much, that, a few days after, he told my father it was high time for him to enter into the holy &s;tate of ma|trimony, and that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in ju&s;tice have no ob|jections. My father, finding it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to conceal his &s;ituation much longer, frankly owned what he had done, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf for not having a&s;ked the con&s;ent of his father, by &s;aying, he knew it would be to no purpo&s;e; and that, had his inclination been known, my grandfather might have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have effectually put the gra|tification
<PB N="3" REF="25">
of it out of his power: he added, that no exception could be made to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty, and good &s;en&s;e, and as for for|tune, it was beneath his con&s;ideration.&mdash;The old gentleman, who kept all his pa&s;&s;ions (except one) in excellent order, heard him to an end with great temper; and then calmly asked, how he propo&s;ed to maintain him&s;elf and &s;pou&s;e?&mdash;He replied, he could be in no danger of wanting, while his father's tenderne&s;s remained, which he and his wife would always cheri&s;h with the utmo&s;t veneration; that he was per&s;uaded his allowance would be &s;uitable to the dignity and circum|&s;tances of his family, and the provi&s;ion already made to his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who were hap|pily &s;ettled under his protection.&mdash;Your brothers and &s;i&s;ters, &s;aid my grandfather, did not think it beneath them to con&s;ult me in an affair of &s;uch importance as matrimony; neither (I &s;uppo&s;e) would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not &s;ome &s;ecret fund in re&s;erve, to the com|forts of which I leave you, with a de&s;ire that you will this night, &s;eek out another habitation for your&s;elf and wife, whither in a &s;hort time, I will &s;end you an account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">pence I have been at in your education, with a view of being reimbur&s;ed.&mdash;Sir, you have made the grand tour&mdash;you are a polite gentleman&mdash;a very pretty gen|tleman&mdash;I wi&s;h you a great deal of joy, and am your very humble &s;ervant. So &s;aying, he left my father in a &s;ituation ea&s;ily imagined. However, he did not long he&s;itate; for lbeing perfectly well acquainted with his father's di&s;po&s;ition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him; and as his re&s;olves were invariable like the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, he knew
<PB N="4" REF="26">
it would be to no purpo&s;e to attempt him by prayers and intreaties; &s;o without any farther application, he betook him&s;elf with his di&s;con&s;o|late bedfellow, to a farm-hou&s;e, where an old &s;ervant of his mother dwelt; there they remain|ed &s;ome time in a &s;ituation but ill adapted to the elegance of their de&s;ires and tenderne&s;s of their love; which neverthele&s;s, my father en|dured, rather than &s;upplicate an unnatural and in|flexible parent: but my mother, fore&s;eeing the inconveniencies &s;he would be expo&s;ed to, if &s;he mu&s;t be delivered in this place (and her pregnan|cy was very far advanced) without communicat|ing her de&s;ign to her hu&s;band, went in di&s;gui&s;e to the hou&s;e of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compa&s;|&s;ion, and reconcile him to an event which could not otherwi&s;e be amended&mdash;She found means to deceive the &s;ervants, and was introduced as an unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of &s;ome matrimonial grievances, it being my grand|father's particular province to decide in all ca&s;es of &s;candal. She was accordingly admitted into his pre&s;ence, where di&s;covering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;ell at his &s;eet, and in the mo&s;t affecting manner, im|plored his forgivene&s;s; at the &s;ame time, repre|&s;enting the danger that threatned not only her life, but that of his own grandchild which was about to &s;ee the light.&mdash;He told her, he was &s;orry that the indi&s;cretion of her and his &s;on had compelled him to make a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;That he had already imparted his thoughts on that &s;ub|ject to her hu&s;band, and was &s;urpri&s;ed that they &s;hould di&s;turb his peace with any further importu|nity.&mdash;This &s;aid, he retired.&mdash;The violence of
<PB N="5" REF="27">
my mother's affliction had &s;uch an effect on her con&s;titution, that &s;he was immediately &s;eized with the pains of childbed; and had not an old maid-&s;ervant to whom &s;he was very dear, afford|ed her pity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at the hazard of in|curring my grandfather's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he and the innocent fruit of her womb mu&s;t have fallen mi&s;erable victims to his rigour and inhumanity.&mdash;By the friend&s;hip of this poor woman, &s;he was carried up to a garret, and immediately delivered of a man-child, the &s;tory of who&s;e unfortunate birth, he him&s;elf now relates.&mdash;My father being informed of what had happened, flew to the em|braces of his darling &s;pou&s;e, and while he loaded his off &s;pring with paternal care&s;&s;es, could not forbear &s;hedding a flood of tears, on behold|ing the dear partner of his heart (for who&s;e ea&s;e he would have &s;acrificed the trea&s;ures of the ea&s;t) &s;tretched upon a flock-bed, in a mi&s;erable apart|ment, unable to protect her from the inclemen|cies of the weather.&mdash;It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the old gentleman was ignorant of what pa&s;&s;ed, tho' he affected to know nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much &s;urprized, when the &s;on of his decea&s;ed elde&s;t &s;on, a pert boy, who lived with him as his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined therefore to pre&s;erve no medium, but immediate|ly (on the third day after her delivery) &s;ent her a peremptory order to begone, and turned off the &s;ervant who had pre&s;erved her life. This be|haviour &s;o exa&s;perated my father, that he had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t dreadful imprecations, and on his bare knees implored that heaven would renounce him, if ever he &s;hould forget or for|give the barbarity of his fire.&mdash;The injuries
<PB N="6" REF="28">
which this unhappy mother received from her removal in &s;uch circum&s;tances, and the want of nece&s;&s;aries where &s;he lodged, together with her grief and anxiety of mind, &s;oon threw her into a langui&s;hing di&s;order which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her tenderly, was &s;o affected with her death, that he remained &s;ix weeks deprived of his &s;en&s;es; during which time, the people where he lodged, carried the infant to the old man, who relented &s;o far, on hearing the melancholy &s;tory of his daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable condition of his &s;on, that he &s;ent the child to nur&s;e, and ordered my father to be carried home to his hou&s;e, where he &s;oon re|covered the u&s;e of his rea&s;on.&mdash;Whether this hard-hearted judge felt any remor&s;e for his cruel treatment of his &s;on and daughter; or (which is more probable) was afraid his character would &s;uffer in the neighbourhood; he profe&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow for his conduct to my father, who&s;e de|lirium was &s;ucceeded by a profound melancholy and re&s;erve. At length he di&s;appeared, and not|with&s;tanding all imaginable inquiry, could never be heard of, which confirmed mo&s;t people in the opinion of his having made away with him&s;elf in a fit of de&s;pair.&mdash;How I under&s;tood the parti|culars of my birth, will appear in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>I grew up&mdash;am hated by my relations&mdash;&s;ent to &s;chool&mdash;neglected by my grandfather&mdash;maltreated by my ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;ea&s;oned to ad|ver&s;ity&mdash;form cabals again&s;t the pedant&mdash;debarred acce&s;s to my grandfather&mdash;hunted by his heir&mdash;demoli&s;h the teeth of his tutor.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE were not wanting &s;ome, who &s;u&s;pected my uncles of being concerned in my father's fate, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would all &s;hare in the patrimony de&s;tined for him: and this conjecture &s;eemed &s;upported by reflecting, that in all his calamities they never di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclination to &s;erve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in their power, fed his father's re&s;entment, and &s;trength|ened his re&s;olution of leaving him to mi&s;ery and want.&mdash;But people of judgment treated this in|&s;inuation as an idle chimera; becau&s;e had my re|lations been &s;o wicked as to con&s;ult their intere&s;t by committing &s;uch an attrocious crime. the fate of my father would have extended to me too, who&s;e life was another ob&s;tacle to their expecta|tion.&mdash;Mean while, I grew apace, and as I &s;trongly re&s;embled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I wanted nothing which their indigent circum&s;tances could af|ford: but their favour was a weak re&s;ource again&s;t the jealous enmity of my cou&s;ins; who, the more my infancy promi&s;ed, con|ceived
<PB N="8" REF="30">
the more implacable hatred again&s;t me; and before I was &s;ix years of age, had &s;o effec|tually blockaded my grandfather, that I never &s;aw him but by &s;tealth; when I &s;ometimes made up to his chair as he fat to view his labourers in the field: on which occa&s;ions, he would &s;troak my head, bid me be a good boy, and promi&s;e he would take care of me.&mdash;I was &s;oon after &s;ent to &s;chool at a village hard by, of which he had been dictator time out of mind: but as he neither paid for my board, nor &s;upplied me with clothes, books, and other nece&s;&s;aries I required, my con|dition was very ragged and contemptible, and the &s;choolma&s;ter, who through fear of my grand|father taught me <HI>gratis,</HI> gave him&s;elf no concern about the progre&s;s I made under his in&s;truction.&mdash;In &s;pite of all the&s;e difficulties and di&s;graces, I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue; and as &s;oon as I could write tolerably, pe&s;tered my grandfather with letters to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;ent for my ma&s;ter, and chid him &s;evere|ly for be&s;towing &s;uch pains on my education, tel|ling him, that if ever I &s;hould be brought to the gallows for forgery, which he had taught me to commit, my blood &s;hould lie on his head.&mdash;The pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the di&s;plea&s;ure of his patron, a&s;&s;ured his honour that the boy's ability was more owing to his own ge|nius and application, than to any in&s;truction or encouragement he received; that, although he could not dive&s;t him of the knowledge he had already imbibed, unle&s;s he would impower him to di&s;able his fingers, he &s;hould endeavour, with G&mdash;d's help, to prevent his future improvement. And indeed, he punctually performed what he he had undertaken: for, on pretence that I had
<PB N="9" REF="31">
wrote impertinent letters to my grandfather, he cau&s;ed a board to be made with five holes in it, through which he thru&s;t the fingers and thumb of my right hand, and fa&s;tened it by whip-cord to my wri&s;t, in &s;uch a manner, that I was effec|tually debarr'd the u&s;e of my pen. But this re|&s;traint I was freed from in a few days, by an ac|cident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy, who taking upon him to in&s;ult my poverty, I was &s;o incen&s;ed at this ungene|rous reproach, that with one &s;troke of my ma|chine, I cut him to the skull, to the great terror of my&s;elf and &s;chool-fellows, who left him bleed|ing on the ground, and ran to inform the ma&s;ter of what had happened. I was &s;o &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed for this tre&s;pa&s;s, that, were I to live to the age of Methu&s;alem, the impre&s;&s;ion it made on me would not be effaced; no more than the an|tipathy and horror I conceived for the mercile&s;s tyrant who inflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced, in all who &s;aw me, the continual wants I was expo&s;ed to, and my own haughty di&s;po&s;ition, impatient of affronts, involved me in a thou&s;and trouble&s;ome adventures, by which I was at length enured to adver&s;ity, and emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly &s;courged for crimes I did not commit, becau&s;e having the character of a vagabond in the village, every piece of mi&s;chief who&s;e author lay unknown, was charged upon me.&mdash;I have been found guilty of robbing orchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hurted, of &s;tealing gingerbread I ne|ver touched, and of abu&s;ing old women I never &s;aw.&mdash;Nay, a &s;tammering carpenter had eloquence enough to per&s;uade my ma&s;ter, that I fired a
<PB N="10" REF="32">
pi&s;tol loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, into his window; though my landlady and the whole family bore witne&s;s, that I was a-bed fa&s;t a&s;leep at the time when this outrage was committed.&mdash;I was flogged for having narrowly e&s;caped drowning, by the &s;inking of a ferry-boat in which I was pa&s;&s;enger.&mdash;Another time for having recovered of a brui&s;e occa&s;ioned by a hor&s;e and cart running over me.&mdash;A third time, for being bit by a baker's dog.&mdash;In &s;hort, whether I was guilty or unfortunate, the vengeance and &s;ympathy of this arbitrary pe|dagogue were the &s;ame. Far from being &s;ubdued by this in&s;ernal u&s;age, my indignation triumphed over that &s;lavi&s;h awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and the more my years and knowledge increa&s;ed, the more I perceived the in|ju&s;tice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon genius, and the advice and direction of our u&s;her, who had &s;erved my fa|ther in his travels, I made a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in the cla&s;&s;icks, writing and arithmetick; &s;o that before I was twelve years old, I was confe&s;&s;edly the be&s;t &s;cholar in the &s;chool: This qualification, together with a boldne&s;s of temper, and &s;trength of make, which had &s;ubjected almo&s;t all my cotemporaries, gave me &s;uch influence over them, that I began to form cabals again&s;t my per&s;ecutor; and was in hopes of being able to bid him defiance in a very &s;hort time.&mdash;Being at the head of a faction con&s;i&s;ting of thirty boys, mo&s;t of them of my own age, I was determined to put their mettal to trial, that I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put my grand &s;cheme in execution: with this view we attacked a body of &s;tout apprentices, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part of the ground allotted
<PB N="11" REF="33">
to us, for the &s;cene of our diver&s;ions; and who were then playing at nine-pins on the &s;pot: but I had the mortification to &s;ee my adherents routed in an in&s;tant, and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl, which one of our adver|&s;aries had detached in pur&s;uit of us.&mdash;This di&s;|comfiture did not hinder us from engaging them afterwards, in frequent skirmi&s;hes which we maintained by throwing &s;tones at a di&s;tance, wherein I received many wounds, the &s;ears of which &s;till remain. Our enemies were &s;o hara&s;|&s;ed and interrupted by the&s;e alarms, that they at la&s;t abandoned their conque&s;t, and left us to the peace|able enjoyment of our own territories.&mdash;It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the exploits we performed in the cour&s;e of this con&s;ederacy, which became the terror of the whole village; in&s;omuch, that when different intere&s;ts divided it, one of the parties commonly courted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ro|derick Random (by which name I was known) to ca&s;t the balance, and keep the oppo&s;ite &s;ection in awe.&mdash;Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day, to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before my grandfather, to whom I &s;eldom found acce&s;s, by rea&s;on of his being &s;o clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by a numerous family of his female grandchildren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among them&s;elves, never failed to join again&s;t me, as the common enemy of all. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but fox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing el&s;e, notwith&s;tanding his grandfather's indul|gence, in entertaining a tutor for him at home; who at the &s;ame time performed the office of pari&s;h clerk. This young Acteon, who inherited his grandfather's antipathy to eve|ry
<PB N="12" REF="34">
thing in di&s;tre&s;s, never &s;et eyes on me, without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into &s;ome cottage or other, whither I generally fled for &s;helter. In this chri&s;tian amu&s;ement, he was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took &s;uch opportunities to ingratiate him&s;elf with the ri&s;ing &s;un, ob&s;erving that the old gentleman, ac|cording to cour&s;e of nature, had not long to live, being already on the verge of four&s;core.&mdash;The behaviour of this ra&s;cally &s;ycophant incen&s;ed me &s;o much, that one day, when I was be|leagured by him and his hounds into a farmer's hou&s;e, where I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent mark&s;man) with a large pebble, which &s;truck out four of his fore|teeth, and effectually incapacitated him for doing the office of a clerk ever after.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT this time, my mother's only bro|ther, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war, arrived in his own country; where being informed of my condition, he came to &s;ee me, and out of his &s;lender finances, not only &s;upplied me with what nece&s;&s;aries I wanted for the pre&s;ent, but re&s;olved not to leave the
<PB N="13" REF="35">
country, until he had prevailed on my grandfa|ther to &s;ettle &s;omething hand&s;ome for the future. This was a task to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant not only of the judge's di&s;po&s;ition, but al&s;o unacquainted with the ways of men in general, to which his edu|cation on board had kept him an utter &s;tranger.&mdash;He was a &s;trong built man, &s;omewhat bandy|legged, with a neck like that of a bull, and a face which (you might ea&s;ily perceive) had with|&s;tood the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate a&s;&s;aults of the weather.&mdash;His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;oldier's coat altered for him by the &s;hip's taylor, a &s;tripped flannel jacket, a pair of red breeches japanned with pitch, clean grey wor&s;ted &s;tockings, large &s;ilver buckles that covered three-fourths of his &s;hoes, a &s;ilver|laced hat who&s;e crown over-looked the brims a|bout an inch and a half, a black bob wig in the buckle, a check &s;hirt, a &s;ilk handkerchief, an hanger with a bra&s;s handle girded to his thigh by a tarni&s;hed laced belt, and a good oak plant under his arm.&mdash;Thus equipt, he &s;et out with me (who by his bounty made a very decent ap|pearance) for my grandfather's hou&s;e, where we were &s;aluted by Jowler and Cae&s;ar, whom my cou&s;in, young ma&s;ter, had let loo&s;e at our approach. Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of the&s;e curs, I was about to betake my&s;elf to my heels, when my uncle &s;eizing me with one hand, brandi&s;hed his cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Cae&s;ar &s;prawling on the ground: but finding him&s;elf attacked at the &s;ame time in the rear by Jowler, and fearing Cae&s;ar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheel'd about, and by a lucky &s;troke, &s;evered Jowler's head from his bo|dy.&mdash;By this time, the young fox-hunter and
<PB N="14" REF="36">
three &s;ervants armed with pitch-forks and flails were come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the dogs, whom they found breathle&s;s upon the field. My cou&s;in was &s;o provoked at the death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance, and take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the cur&s;es and reproaches his an|ger could &s;ugge&s;t.&mdash;Upon which my uncle &s;tepped forwards with an undaunted air, at the &s;ight of who&s;e bloody weapon, his antagoni&s;ts fell back with precipitation; when he acco&s;ted their leader thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Look&eacute;e, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what I did was in my own de&s;ence.&mdash;So you had be&s;t be civil, and let us &s;hoot a-head, clear of you."</Q> Whether the young '&s;quire mi&s;interpreted my uncle's de&s;ire of peace, or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his u&s;ual pitch of re|&s;olution, I know not; but he &s;natched a flall from one of his followers, and came up with a &s;hew of a&s;&s;aulting the lieutenant, who putting him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence, proceeded thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Look&eacute;e, you lubberly &s;on of a w&mdash;e, if you come athwart me, 'ware your gingerbread|work.&mdash;I'll be foul of your quarter, d&mdash;n me."</Q> This declaration followed by a &s;louri&s;h of his hanger, &s;eemed to check the progre&s;s of the young gentleman's choler, who, upon turn|ing about, perceived his attendants had &s;lunk in|to the hou&s;e, &s;hut the gate, and left him to de|cide the contention by him&s;elf.&mdash;Here a parley en&s;ued, which was introduced by my cou&s;in's asking, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who the d&mdash;l are you?&mdash;What do you want?&mdash;Some &s;coundrel of a &s;eaman (I &s;up|po&s;e) who has de&s;erted and turned thief.&mdash;But don't think you &s;hall e&s;cape, &s;irrah,&mdash;I'll have

<PB N="21" REF="43">
which was immediately performed to his &s;ati&s;|faction.&mdash;In the mean time, orders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which number I was included: but my uncle would not &s;uffer me to accept of it, until I &s;hould be a&s;|&s;ured whether or no I had rea&s;on to honour his memory &s;o far.&mdash;During this interval, the con|jectures of people, with regard to the old gentle|man's will, were various: as it was well known, he had, be&s;ides his landed e&s;tate, which was worth 700<HI>l. per annum,</HI> &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and pounds at intere&s;t. Some imagined, that the whole real e&s;tate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom he always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally divided between my female cou&s;ins (five in num|ber) and me.&mdash;Others were of opinion, that as the re&s;t of his children had been already provided for, he would only bequeath two or three hun|dred pounds to each of his grand-daughters, and leave the bulk of the &s;um to me, to atone for his unnatural u&s;age towards my father.&mdash;At length the important hour arrived, and the will was produced in the mid&s;t of the expectants, who&s;e looks and ge&s;tures formed a groupe that would have been very entertaining to an uncon|cerned &s;pectator.&mdash;But the reader can &s;carce con|ceive the a&s;toni&s;hment and mortification that ap|peared, when an attorney pronounced aloud, the young '&s;quire &s;ole heir of all his grandfather's e&s;tate per&s;onal and real.&mdash;My uncle, who had li&s;tened with great attention, &s;ucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied the&s;e words of the attorney with a &s;tare, and <HI>whew,</HI> that alarmed the whole a&s;&s;embly. The elde&s;t and perte&s;t of my female competitors, who had been
<PB N="22" REF="44">
always very officious about my grandfather's per|&s;on, enquired with a faultering accent, and vi&s;age as yellow as an orange, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if there were no le|gacies?"</Q> &s;he was an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"none at all."&mdash;</Q>Upon which &s;he fainted away.&mdash;The re&s;t, who&s;e expectations (perhaps) were not &s;o &s;anguine, &s;upported their di&s;appointment with more re&s;olu|tion; though not without giving evident marks of indignation, and grief at lea&s;t as genuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentle|man's death. My conductor, after having kicked with his heel for &s;ome time again&s;t the wain&s;cot, began: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So there's no legacy, friend, ha!&mdash;here's an old Succubus;&mdash;but &s;omebody's &s;oul howls for it, d&mdash;n me!"&mdash;</Q>The par&s;on of the pari&s;h, who was one of the executors, and had acted as gho&s;tly director of the old man, no &s;ooner heard this, than he cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Avaunt, unchri&s;tian reveler! avaunt! wilt thou not al|low the &s;oul of his honour to re&s;t in the grave till the re&s;urrection?"&mdash;</Q>But this zealous pa&s;tor did not find him&s;elf &s;o warmly &s;econded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined my uncle again&s;t him, and accu&s;ed him of hav|ing acted the part of a bu&s;y-body with their grand|papa, who&s;e ears he had mo&s;t certainly abu&s;ed by fal&s;e &s;tories to their prejudice, or el&s;e he would not have neglected them, in &s;uch an unnatural manner.&mdash;The young '&s;quire was much diverted with this &s;cene, and whi&s;pered to my uncle, that if he had not murdered his dogs, he would have &s;hewn him glorious &s;un, by hunting a black bad|ger (&s;o he term'd the clergyman).&mdash;The &s;urly lieutenant, who was not in an humour to reli&s;h this amu&s;ement, replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you and your dogs may be damned.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e you'll find them

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON our way back to the village, my uncle &s;poke not a word during the &s;pace of a whole hour, but whi&s;tled with great vehemence, the tune of, <HI>Why &s;hould we quarrel for riches, &amp;c.</HI> his vi&s;age being contracted all the while into a mo&s;t formidable &s;rown. At length his pace was increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that I was often left behind a con&s;iderable way, which when he per|ceived, he would wait for me; and when I was almo&s;t up with him, call out in a &s;urly tone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bear a hand, damme!&mdash;mu&s;t I bring to every minute for you, you lazy dog."&mdash;</Q>Then laying hold of me by the arm, haul me along, until his good nature (of which he had a good &s;hare) and reflection, getting the better of his pa&s;&s;ion, he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, my boy, don't be ca&s;t down,&mdash;the old ra&s;cal is in hell,&mdash;that's &s;ome &s;atisfaction;&mdash;you &s;hall go to &s;ea with me, my lad.&mdash;<HI>A light heart and a thin pair of breeches, goes thro' the world, brave boys;</HI> as the &s;ong goes&mdash;eh!"&mdash;</Q>Though this propo&s;al did
<PB N="24" REF="46">
not at all &s;uit my inclination, I was afraid of di&s;|covering my aver&s;ion to it, le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;oblige the only friend I had in the world; and he was &s;o much a &s;eaman, that he never dreamt I could have any objection to his de&s;ign; con&s;equently, gave him&s;elf no trouble in con&s;ulting my appro|bation. But this re&s;olution was &s;oon dropt, at the advice of our u&s;her, who a&s;&s;ured Mr. Bowling, it would be a thou&s;and pities to baulk my genius, which would certainly, one day, make my for|tune on &s;hore, provided it received due cultiva|tion.&mdash;Upon which, this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford it) to give me univer|&s;ity education; and accordingly, &s;ettled my board and other expences, at a town not many miles di&s;tant, famous for its colleges, whither we re|paired in a &s;hort time.&mdash;But before the day of our departure, the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who no longer had the fear of my grandfather before his eyes, laid a&s;ide all decency and re&s;traint, and not only abu&s;ed me in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t language his rancour could &s;ugge&s;t, as a wicked profligate, dull, beggarly mi&s;creant, whom he had taught out of charity; but al&s;o inveighed in the mo&s;t bitter manner a|gain&s;t the memory of the judge (who by the bye had procured that &s;ettlement for him) hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentleman's &s;oul was damn'd to all eternity, for his inju&s;tice in neglecting to pay for my learning.&mdash;This brutal behaviour, added to the &s;ufferings I had formerly undergone, made me think it high time to be revenged of this in&s;olent pedagogue. Hav|ing con&s;ulted my adherents, I found them all &s;taunch in their promi&s;es to &s;tand by me; and our &s;cheme was this:&mdash;In the afternoon preceed|ing the day of departure for the univer&s;ity, I
<PB N="25" REF="47">
was to take the advantage of the u&s;her's go|ing out to make water (which he regularly did at four o'clock) and &s;hut the great door, that he might not come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;upe|rior. This being done, the a&s;&s;ault was to be be|gun, by my advancing to the ma&s;ter and &s;pitting in his face. I was to be &s;econded by two of the &s;tronge&s;t boys in the &s;chool, who were devoted to me; their bu&s;ine&s;s was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be lai~d, and his bare po&s;teriors heartily flogged with his own birch, which we propo&s;ed to wre&s;t from him in the &s;truggle; but if we &s;hould find him too many for us all three, we were to demand the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our competitors, who &s;hould be ready to reinforce us, or oppo&s;e any thing that might be undertaken by the re&s;t of the boys for the ma&s;ter's relief. One of my principal a&s;|&s;i&s;tants was called Jeremy Gawky, &s;on and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood; and the name of the other, Hugh Strap, the ca|det of a family which had given &s;hoemakers to the village time out of mind.&mdash;I had once &s;aved Gawky's life, by plunging into a river where he was on the point of being drowned, and by the help of &s;wimming, dragging him a&s;hore; I had often re&s;cued him from the clutches of tho&s;e whom his in&s;ufferable arrogance had provoked, to a re&s;entment he was not able to &s;u&s;tain;&mdash;and I had many times &s;aved his reputation and po&s;teriors, by performing his exerci&s;es at &s;chool; &s;o that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular regard for me and my intere&s;ts. The attachment of Strap, flowed from a voluntary, di&s;intere&s;ted inclination, which had manife&s;ted it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions in my behalf, having once rendered me
<PB N="26" REF="48">
the &s;ame &s;ervice as I had afforded to Gawky, by &s;aving my life at the risk of his own; and often fathered offences I had committed, for which he &s;uffered &s;everely, rather than I &s;hould feel the the weight of the puni&s;hment I de&s;erved.&mdash;The&s;e two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprize, as they intended to leave the &s;chool next day, as well as I; the fir&s;t being or|dered by his father to return into the country, and the other being bound apprentice to a barber, at a market town not far off.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my uncle being informed of my ma&s;ter's behaviour to me, was enraged be|yond all compo&s;ition, and vowed revenge &s;o heartily, that I could not refrain from telling him the &s;cheme I had concerted, which he heard with great &s;atisfaction, at every &s;entence &s;quirting out a mouthful of &s;pittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he con&s;tantly chewed a large quid.&mdash;At la&s;t, pulling up his breeches, he cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, no, Z&mdash;ds! that won't do neither,&mdash;how&s;omever, 'tis a bold undertaking, my lad,&mdash;that I mu&s;t &s;ay, i' faith!&mdash;but look&eacute;e, look&eacute;e, how do&s;t propo&s;e to get clear off?&mdash;won't the enemy give chace, my boy?&mdash;ay, ay, that he will, I warrant&mdash;and alarm the whole coa&s;t&mdash;ah!

were very proud of our a&s;|&s;ociate, who immediately went to work, and pre|pared the in&s;trument of his revenge with great skill and expedition; after which, he ordered our baggage to be packed up and &s;ent off, a day be|fore our attempt, and got hor&s;es ready to be mounted, as &s;oon as the affair &s;hould be over. At length the hour arrived, when our auxiliary, &s;eizing the opportunity of the u&s;her's ab&s;ence, bolted in, &s;ecured the door, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar, who bawled out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Murder!

to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on purpo&s;e, after having fa&s;tened his hands behind his back, pulled down his breeches, and tucked up his garments and &s;hirt, as far as they would go&mdash;In this ludicrous po&s;ture he &s;tood (to the no &s;mall entertainment of the boys, who crowded about him, and &s;houted with great exultation at the novelty of the &s;ight) vent|ing bitter imprecations again&s;t the lieutenant, and reproaching his &s;cholars with treachery and re|bellion: when the u&s;her was admitted, whom my uncle acco&s;ted in this manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hark&eacute;e, Mr. Syntax, I believe you are an hone&s;t man, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;and I have a re&s;pect for you&mdash;but for all that, we mu&s;t for our own &s;ecurity (d'ye &s;ee) belay you for a &s;hort time."&mdash;</Q>With the&s;e words, he pulled out &s;ome fathoms of cord, which the hone&s;t man no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he prote&s;ted with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that he would allow no violence to be offered to him, at the &s;ame time accu&s;ing me of perfidy and ingratitude.

My uncle having unbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me, told him, that he propo&s;ed to give him a little di&s;cipline for the good of his &s;oul: which he immediately put in practice, with great vigour and dexterity. This &s;mart application to the pedant's withered pofte|riors, gave him &s;uch exqui&s;ite pain, that he roared like a mad bull, danced, cur&s;ed, bla&s;phemed, and

acted to the life, the part of a frantick bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now, friend, you'll remember me the longe&s;t day you have to live&mdash;I have given you a le&s;&s;on, that will let you know what flogging is, and teach you to have more &s;ympathy for the future&mdash;&s;hout, boys, &s;hout."&mdash;</Q>This ceremony was no &s;ooner over, than my uncle propo&s;ed they &s;hould quit the &s;chool, and convoy their old comrade Rory to a public hou&s;e, a|bout a mile from the village, where he would treat them all.&mdash;This offer being joyfully em|braced, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr Syntax, and begged him to accompany us, which he refu&s;ed with great di&s;dain, telling my benefactor, that he was not the man he took him to be&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, well, old &s;urly (replied my uncle, &s;haking his hand) thou art an hone&s;t fellow notwith&s;tanding; and if ever I have the command of a &s;hip, thou &s;halt be &s;chool ma&s;ter, i' faith."</Q> So &s;aying, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boys, and locking the door, left the two preceptors to con&s;ole one another; while we moved forwards on our journey, attended by a numerous retinue, whom he treated according to his promi&s;e.&mdash;We parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road, about ten miles &s;hort of the town where I was to re|main, at which we arrived next day, and I found I had no cau&s;e to complain of the accommodations provided for me; being boarded at the hou&s;e of an apothecary, who had married a di&s;tant relation of my mother.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I make great progre&s;s in my &s;tudies&mdash;am care&s;&s;ed by every body&mdash;my female cou&s;ins take notice of me&mdash;I reject their invi|tation&mdash;they are incen&s;ed and con&s;pire again&s;t me&mdash;I am left de&s;titute by a mi&s;|fortune that befals my uncle&mdash;Gawky's treachery&mdash;my revenge.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I was now capable of reflection, I began to con&s;ider my precarious &s;ituation; that I was utterly abandoned by tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to protect me; and that my &s;ole dependance was on the genero&s;ity of one man, who was not only expo&s;ed by his profe&s;&s;ion, to continual dangers, which might one day deprive me of him for ever; but al&s;o (no doubt) &s;ubject to tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of di&s;po&s;ition, which a change of for|tune u&s;ually creates; or, which a better acquaint|ance with the world might produce:&mdash;for I al|ways a&s;cribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind.&mdash;Alarmed at the&s;e con&s;iderations, I re|&s;olved to apply my&s;elf with great care to my &s;tudies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: This I did with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in the &s;pace of three years, I under&s;tood Greek very well, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no &s;tranger to moral and natural philo&s;ophy: logick I made no account of; but above all things, I valued my&s;elf on my ta&s;te in the <HI>Belle Lettre,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="53">
and a talent for poetry, which had already pro|duced &s;ome morceaus, that brought me a great deal of reputation. The&s;e qualifications added to a good face and &s;hape, acquired the e&s;teem and acquaintance of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people in town, and I had the &s;atisfaction to find my&s;elf in &s;ome degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxi|cating piece of good fortune, to one of my a|morous complexion! which I obtained, or at lea&s;t pre&s;erved, by gratifying their propen&s;ity to &s;candal, in lampooning their rivals.&mdash;Two of my female cou&s;ins lived in this place, with their mother, after the death of their father, who left his whole fortune (which was con&s;iderable) equal|ly divided between them; &s;o that if they were not the mo&s;t beautiful, they were at lea&s;t the riche&s;t toa&s;ts in town; and received daily the addre&s;&s;es of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country.&mdash;Although I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the mo&s;t &s;upercilious contempt, which I endeavoured to return by the mo&s;t per|fect neglect, my character now attracted their notice &s;o much, that I was given to under&s;tand, I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if I plea&s;ed.&mdash;The reader will ea&s;ily perceive, that this conde&s;cen&s;ion either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity &s;ub&s;ervient to their malice, or at lea&s;t of &s;creening them&s;elves from the la&s;h of my re&s;entment, which they effectual|ly provoked.&mdash;I enjoyed this triumph with great rapture; and not only rejected their offer with di&s;dain, but, in all my performances, whether &s;a|tire or panegyric, indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided mention|ing their names, even while I celebrated tho&s;e of their intimates, which mortified their pride ex|ceedingly, and incen&s;ed them to &s;uch a degree,
<PB N="32" REF="54">
that they rendered them&s;elves univer&s;ally ridi|culous in &s;atisfying their re&s;entment again&s;t me.&mdash;The fir&s;t &s;troke of their revenge con&s;i&s;ted in their hiring a poor collegian to write ver&s;es a|gain&s;t me, the &s;ubject of which was my own po|verty, and the cata&s;trophe of my unhappy parents; but be&s;ides the badne&s;s of the compo&s;ition (of which they them&s;elves were a&s;hamed) they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me with tho&s;e misfortunes, which they and their relations had intailed upon me; and which con|&s;equently, reflected much more di&s;honour on them|&s;elves, than on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice.&mdash;Finding this plan mi&s;carry, they found means to irritate a young gentleman again&s;t me, by telling him I had lam|pooned his mi&s;tre&s;s; and &s;o effectually &s;ucceeded in the quality of incendiaries, that this enraged lover determined to &s;eize me next night, as I returned to my lodgings from a friend's hou&s;e that I fre|quented; with this view, he waited in the &s;treet, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had imparted his de&s;ign of carrying me down to the river, in which he propo&s;ed to have me hear|tily ducked, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, it being then about the middle of De|cember.&mdash;But this &s;tratagem did not &s;ucceed; for, being appri&s;ed of their ambu&s;h, I got home another way, and by the help of my landlord's apprentice, emptied a clo&s;e &s;tool out of the gar|ret window, which did great execution upon them; and next day, occa&s;ioned &s;o much mirth at their expence, that they found them&s;elves un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the town, until the ad|venture &s;hould be entirely forgotten.&mdash;My cou&s;ins (though twice baffled in their expectation)
<PB N="33" REF="55">
did not however, de&s;i&s;t from per&s;ecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s, by detecting their malice, and preventing its effects: neither would I have found them more humane, had I patiently &s;ubmit|ted to their rancour, and bore without murmuring the rigour of their unrea&s;onable hate; for, I have found by experience, that though &s;mall favours may be acknowledged, and &s;light injuries atoned, there is no wretch &s;o ungrateful as he, whom you have mo&s;t generou&s;ly obliged; and no ene|my &s;o implacable, as tho&s;e who have done you mo&s;t wrong.&mdash;The&s;e good-natured creatures, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;cheme which con|&s;pired with a piece of bad news I &s;oon after re|ceived, to give them all the &s;atisfaction they de|&s;ired: this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident, and prevail on him to betray the tru&s;t I repo&s;ed in him, by imparting to them the particulars of my &s;mall amours, which they publi&s;hed with &s;uch exaggerations, that I &s;uffered very much in the opinion of every body, and was utterly di&s;carded, by the dear creatures who&s;e names had been called in que&s;tion.&mdash;While I was bu&s;ied in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I might not only be re|venged on him, but al&s;o vindicate my character to my friends; I one day, perceived the looks of my landlady &s;o altered, when I went home to dinner, that upon enquiring into the cau&s;e, &s;he &s;crewed up her mouth, and fixing her eyes on the ground, told me her hu&s;band had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclo&s;ed for me&mdash;&s;he was very &s;orry for what had happened, both for my &s;ake, and his own&mdash;People &s;hould be more cautious of their cnoduct&mdash;&s;he

was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into &s;ome misfortune or other.&mdash;As for her part, &s;he would be very ready to befriend me; but &s;he had a &s;mall family of her own to maintain.&mdash;The world would do nothing for her if &s;he &s;hould come to want&mdash;charity begins at home.&mdash;She wi&s;h|ed I had been bound to &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial handicraft, &s;uch as a weaver or &s;hoemaker, rather than loiter away my time in learning fooli&s;h non&s;en&s;e that would never bring me in a penny&mdash;but &s;ome folks are wi&s;e, and &s;ome are otherwi&s;e&mdash;I was li&s;tening to this my&s;terious di&s;cour&s;e, with great amazement, when her hu&s;band entered, and without &s;peaking a &s;yllable, put both the letters into my hand.&mdash;I received them trembling, and read what follows:</P>

Where|upon I recounted the conver&s;ation; and when I repeated the an&s;wer I made to his ungenerous re|mon&s;trance with regard to my leaving his hou&s;e, this pretended friend affected a &s;tare, and ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it po&s;&s;ible you could behave &s;o ill to the man who had treated you &s;o kindly all along?"&mdash;</Q>My &s;urpri&s;e at hearing this, was not at all affected, whatever his might be; and I gave him to under&s;tand, with &s;ome warmth, that I did not imagine he would &s;o unrea&s;onably e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of a &s;coundrel, who ought to be expelled from every &s;ocial community.&mdash;This heat of mine, gave him all the advantage he de|&s;ired over me, and our di&s;cour&s;e (after much al|tercation) concluded in his de&s;iring never to &s;ee me again in that place; to which I yielded my con&s;ent, a&s;&s;uring him, that had I been as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now, he never &s;hould have had an opportunity to make that reque&s;t.&mdash;And thus we parted.</P>

dancing, fencing; and to &s;ee the world. As I had lived with him, &s;ince his arrival, on the foot|ing of our old intimacy, I made no &s;cruple of in|forming him of the lowne&s;s of my circum&s;tances, and asking a &s;mall &s;upply of money, to an&s;wer my pre&s;ent expence; upon which he pulled out an handful of half-pence with a &s;hilling or two among them, and &s;wore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter day; having lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his allowance the night before at billiards. Though this might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at his indif|ference; for he neither di&s;covered any &s;ympathy for my mi&s;hap, nor de&s;ire of alleviating my di&s;|tre&s;s; and accordingly, I left him without utter|ing one word: But when I afterwards under|&s;tood, that he was the per&s;on who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cou&s;ins, to whom likewi&s;e he had carried the tidings of my forlorn &s;ituation, which afforded them great mat|ter of triumph and exultation, I determined with my&s;elf to call him to a &s;evere account; for which purpo&s;e, I borrowed a &s;word, and wrote a challenge, de&s;iring him to meet me at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of puni&s;hing his perfidy, at the expence of his blood.&mdash;He accepted the invitation, and I betook my&s;elf to the field, though not without feeling con&s;iderable repugnance to the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold &s;weats by the way;&mdash;but the de&s;ire of revenge, the &s;hame of retracting, and hope of conque&s;t, con&s;pired to repel the&s;e unmanly &s;ymptoms of fear; and I appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not ill plea&s;ed to find he had no mind to

<P>The ho&s;tler of the inn at which we put up, under&s;tanding I was bound for London, advi&s;ed me to take my pa&s;&s;age in a collier, which would be both cheap and expeditious, and withal much ea&s;ier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads, in the winter time; which he believed I had not &s;trength enough to perform.&mdash;I was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to take his advice, when, one day, &s;tepping into a barber's &s;hop to be &s;haved, the young man, while he la|thered my face, acco&s;ted me thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I pre|&s;ume you are a Scotchman."</Q> To which I an|&s;wered in the affirmative.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray (continued he) of what part of Scotland?"&mdash;</Q>I no &s;ooner told him, than he di&s;covered great emotion, and not confining his operation to my chin and upper lip, be&s;meared my whole face with great agitation.&mdash;At which I was &s;o offended, that &s;tarting up, I a&s;ked him what the d&mdash;I he meant by u&s;ing me &s;o?&mdash;He begged pardon, telling me his joy in meeting with a countryman, had oc|ca&s;ioned &s;ome confu&s;ion in him; and craved my name.&mdash;But when I declared my name was Ran|dom he exclaimed in a rapture, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How!

<P>AFTER having paid our &s;core, and taken leave of our ho&s;te&s;s, who embraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, ble&s;&s;ing our &s;elves that we had come off &s;o well. We had not walked above five miles, when we ob&s;erved a man on hor&s;e-back galloping after us, whom we in a &s;hort time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us &s;o much vexation.&mdash;He &s;topped hard by me, and asked if I knew who he was?&mdash;My a&s;to|ni&s;hment had di&s;concerted me &s;o much, that I did not hear his que&s;tion, which he repeated with a volley of oaths and threats; but I remain|ed as mute as before.&mdash;Strap &s;eeing my di&s;com|po&s;ure, fell upon his knees in the mud, uttering with a lamentable voice, the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For Ch&mdash;&s;t's &s;ake, have mercy upon us, Mr. Rifle, we know you very well."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O ho! cried the thief, you do!&mdash;but by G&mdash;d, you never &s;hall be evidence again&s;t me in this world, you dog!"&mdash;</Q>So &s;aying, he drew a
<PB N="59" REF="81">
pi&s;tol, and fired it at the unfortunate &s;haver, who fell flat upon the ground without &s;peaking one word.&mdash;My comrade's fate, and my own &s;itua|tion, rivetted me to the place where I &s;tood, de|prived of all &s;en&s;e and reflection; &s;o that I did not make the lea&s;t attempt either to run away, or de|precate the wrath of this barbarian, who &s;napped a &s;econd pi&s;tol at me; but before he had time to prime again, perceived a company of hor&s;e-men coming up; whereupon he rode off, and left me &s;tanding motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, in which po&s;ture I was &s;ound by tho&s;e who&s;e appearance had &s;aved my life.&mdash;This company, which con&s;i&s;ted of three men in livery, well armed, was headed by an of|ficer, who (as I afterwards learned) was the per|&s;on from whom Rifle had taken the pocket pi&s;tols the day before; and who, making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road, a&s;&s;uring him, his non-re&s;i&s;tance was altogether owing to his con&s;ideration for the ladies in the coach, procured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Lord&s;hip's &s;ervants to go in que&s;t of the plunderer.&mdash;This holiday captain &s;campered up to me with great addre&s;s, and asked who fired the pi&s;tol which he had heard.&mdash;As I had not yet recovered my rea&s;on, he, before I could an&s;wer, ob&s;erved a body lying on the ground: at which &s;ight, his colour va|ni&s;hed, and he pronounced with a faultering tongue, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gentlemen, here's murder committed I Let us alight."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, no, &s;aid one of his followers, let us rather pur&s;ue the murderer.&mdash;Which way went he, young man?"&mdash;</Q>By this time, I had recollected my&s;elf &s;o far as to tell them he could not be a quarter of a mile be|fore them; and beg one of them to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in conveying the corps of my friend to the next
<PB N="60" REF="82">
hou&s;e, in order to its being interred.&mdash;The captain fore&s;eeing that in ca&s;e he pur&s;ued, he mu&s;t &s;oon come to action, began to curb his hor&s;e, and give him the &s;pur at the &s;ame time, which made the crea|ture rear up and &s;nort in &s;uch a manner, that he called out, his hor&s;e was frightened and would not proceed; at the &s;ame time wheeling him round and round, &s;troaking his neck, whi&s;tling and wheedling him with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sirrah, &s;irrah&mdash;gently, gently, &amp;c."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Z&mdash;ds! (cries one of the &s;ervants) &s;ure my Lord's Sorrel is not re&s;ty!"&mdash;</Q>With the&s;e words, he be&s;towed a la&s;h on his buttocks, and Sorrel di&s;daining the rein, &s;prung forward with the captain at a pace that would have &s;oon brought him up with the robber, had not the girth (happily for him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and two of his attendants continued their pur&s;uit, without minding his &s;ituation in the lea&s;t.&mdash;Mean while one of the three who remained at my de&s;ire, turning the Body of Strap to one &s;ide, in order to &s;ee the wound which had killed him, found him &s;till warm and breathing; whereupon I im|mediately let him blood, and &s;aw him, with in|expre&s;&s;ible joy, recover; having received no o|ther wound than what his &s;ear inflicted.&mdash;Having got him upon his legs, we walked toge|ther to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where Strap being not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time after, the third &s;ervant returned with the captain's hor&s;e and furniture, leaving him&s;elf to crawl after as well as he could. This Gentleman of the &s;word upon his arrival, complained grievou&s;ly of the brui&s;e occa&s;ioned by his fall; and on the recommendation of the &s;er|vant,
<PB N="61" REF="83">
who warranted my ability, I was em|ployed to bleed him, for which he rewarded me with half a crown.</P>
<P>The time between this and dinner, I pa&s;&s;ed in ob&s;erving a game at cards, between two farmers, an exci&s;eman, and a young fellow in a ru&s;ty gown and ca&s;&s;ock, who, as I afterwards under&s;tood, was curate of a neighbouring pari&s;h.&mdash;It was ea&s;y to perceive that the match was not equal; the two farmers being partners, having to do with a couple of &s;harpers, who &s;tript them of all their ca&s;h in a very &s;hort time.&mdash;But what &s;urpri&s;ed me very much, was to hear this clergyman reply to one of the countrymen who &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect foul play, in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;n me, friend, d'ye que&s;tion my honour?"&mdash;</Q>I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being an animal frequent in my own country; but I was &s;candalized at the indecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he &s;wore, and the baudy &s;ongs which he &s;ung.&mdash;At la&s;t, to make amends, in &s;ome &s;ort, for the damage he had done the unwary boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown, and promi&s;ing to treat them with a dinner, began to play mo&s;t melodiou&s;ly, &s;inging all the while in concert.&mdash;This good humour of the par&s;on in&s;pired the company with &s;o much glee, that the farmers &s;oon forgot their lo&s;&s;es, and all hands went to dancing in the yard. While we were agreeably amu&s;ed in this manner, our mu&s;ician &s;pying a hor&s;eman riding towards the inn, &s;topt all of a &s;udden, crying out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gad &s;o! gentlemen, I beg your pardon, there's our dog of a doctor coming into the inn."&mdash;</Q>And immediately concealed his in&s;trument, and ran towards the gate, where he took hold of the
<PB N="62" REF="84">
vicar's bridle, and helped him off, enquiring very cordially into the &s;tate of his health.&mdash;This ro&s;y &s;on of the church (who might be about the age of fifty) having alighted, and entru&s;ted the curate with his hor&s;e, &s;talked with great &s;olemnity into the kitchen, where, &s;itting down by the fire, he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe; &s;carce deign|ing an an&s;wer to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive que&s;tions of &s;ome pre&s;ent who knew him, about the welfare of his family.&mdash;While he indulged him&s;elf in this &s;tate, amid&s;t a profound &s;ilence, the curate approaching him with great reverence, asked if he would not be plea&s;ed to honour us with his company at din|ner? To which he an&s;wered in the negative, &s;aying, he had been to vi&s;it '&s;quire Bumpkin, who had drank him&s;elf into a high fever at the la&s;t a&s;&s;izes; and that he had, on leaving his own hou&s;e, told Betty he &s;hould dine at home.&mdash;Ac|cordingly, when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe, he got up and moved towards the door with the fame dignity as when he entered; where his journeyman &s;tood ready with his nag.&mdash;He had no &s;ooner mounted, than this facetious per&s;on, coming into the kitchen, began in this manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There the old ra&s;cal goes, and the D&mdash;l go with him.&mdash;You &s;ee how the world wags, gentlemen.&mdash;By G&mdash;d, this rogue of a vicar does not de&s;erve to live;&mdash;and yet he has two livings worth 400<HI>l. per annum,</HI> while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach, for what? why truly, for 20<HI>l.</HI> a year.&mdash;I &s;corn to boa&s;t of my own qualifications, but&mdash;compari|&s;ons, you know, are odious.&mdash;I &s;hould be glad to know how this &s;wag-bellied doctor de&s;erves to be more at ea&s;e than me.&mdash;He can loll in his

When our meal was ended, and every man's &s;hare of the reckoning adju&s;ted, the cu|rate went out on pretence of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary oc|ca&s;ion, and mounting his hor&s;e, left the two far|mers to &s;atisfy the ho&s;t in the be&s;t manner they could.&mdash;We were no &s;ooner informed of this piece of fine&s;&s;e, then the exci&s;eman who had been &s;ilent hitherto, began with a malicious grin, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, ay, this is an old trick of Shufle,&mdash;I could not help &s;miling, when he talked of treating.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, this is a very curious fellow.&mdash;He picked up &s;ome &s;craps of learning while he &s;erved young lord Trifle at the univer&s;ity.&mdash;But what he mo&s;t excells in, is pimping.&mdash;No man knows his talents better than I, for I was <HI>valet de chambre</HI> to '&s;quire Tattle, an inti|mate companion of Shuffle's lord.&mdash;He got him&s;elf into a &s;crape, by pawning &s;ome of his lord&s;hip's cloaths, on which account he was turned away; but as he was acquainted with &s;ome particular circum&s;tances of my lord's con|duct, he did not care to exa&s;perate him too much, and &s;o made intere&s;t for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him to the curacy

</ARGUMENT>
<P>STRAP and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a croud on the road, coming towards us, &s;houting and hollowing all the way. As it approached, we could di&s;cern a man on hor&s;e-back in the middle, with his hands tied behind him, whom we &s;oon knew to be Rifle.&mdash;This highwayman not being &s;o well mounted as the two &s;ervants who went in pur&s;uit of him, was &s;oon overtaken, and after having di&s;charged his pi&s;tols, made pri&s;oner without any further oppo&s;ition. They were carrying him in triumph, amid&s;t the acclamations of the country people, to a ju&s;tice of peace in a neighbouring village, but &s;topt at our inn to join their com|panion and take refre&s;hment. When Rifle was di&s;mounted, and placed in the yard, within a cir|cle of pea&s;ants armed with pitch-forks, I was amazed to &s;ee what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours ago,
<PB N="66" REF="88">
filled me with &s;o much terror and confu&s;ion.&mdash;My companion was &s;o much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance, that going up to the thief, he pre&s;ented his clenched fi&s;ts to his no&s;e, and declared, that he would either cudgel or box with the pri&s;oner for a guinea, which he im|mediately produced; and began to &s;trip&mdash;but was di&s;&s;uaded from this adventure by me, who repre&s;ented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was now in the hands of ju&s;tice, which would, no doubt, give us all &s;atisfaction enough.&mdash;But what made me repent of our impertinent curio&s;ity, was our being detained by the captors, as evidence again&s;t him, when we were ju&s;t going to &s;et forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to comply, and accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the &s;ame road that we propo&s;ed.&mdash;About the twilight we arrived at the place of our de&s;tination, but as the ju&s;tice was gone to vi&s;it a gentleman in the country, with whom he would probably &s;tay all night, the rob|ber was confined in an empty garret three &s;tories high, from which it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape: this, neverthele&s;s, was the ca&s;e; for next morning, when they went up &s;tairs, to bring him before the ju&s;tice, the bird was flown, having got out at the window upon the leads, from whence he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoin|ing hou&s;es, and got into another garret window, where he &s;culked, until the family were a&s;leep, at which time he ventured down &s;tairs, and let him&s;elf out by the &s;treet door, which was found open. This event was a great di&s;appointment to tho&s;e that ap|prehended him, who were flu&s;hed with hopes of the reward; but gave me great joy, as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any further mole&s;tation.&mdash;Re&s;olving to make up for the &s;mall
<PB N="67" REF="89">
progre&s;s we had hitherto made, we this day travelled with great vigour, and before night got to a market-town twenty miles from the place from whence we &s;et out in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice.&mdash;Here having taken up our lodging at an inn, I found my&s;elf &s;o fa|tigued, that I began to de&s;pair of performing our journey on foot, and de&s;ired Strap to enquire if there was any waggon, return-hor&s;es, or other cheap carriage in this place, to depart for London to-morrow or next day.&mdash;He was informed, that the waggon from Newca&s;tle for London had halted here two nights ago, and that it would be an ea&s;y matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at farthe&s;t the day after the next.&mdash;This piece of news gave us &s;ome &s;atisfaction, and after making a hearty &s;upper on ha&s;hed mutton, we were &s;hewn to our room, which contained two beds, the one allotted for us, and the other for a very hone&s;t gentleman, who, we were told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well di&s;pen&s;ed with his company, we were glad to &s;ubmit to this di&s;po&s;ition, as there was not another bed empty in the hou&s;e; and accord|ingly went to re&s;t, after having &s;ecured our baggage under the bol&s;ter. About two or three a-clock in the morning, I was waked out of a very profound &s;leep, by a dreadful noi&s;e in the cham|ber, which did not fail to throw me into an a|gony of con&s;ternation, when I heard the&s;e words pronounced with a terrible voice.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Blood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that's next you, and I'll blow the other's brains out pre&s;ently."&mdash;</Q>This dreadful &s;alutation had no &s;ooner reached the ears of Strap, than &s;tarting out of bed, he run again&s;t &s;ome body in the dark,
<PB N="68" REF="90">
and overturned him in an in&s;tant, at the &s;ame time bawling out, <Q>"Fire! murder! fire!</Q> which in a moment alarmed the whole hou&s;e, and fil|led our chamber with a croud of naked people.&mdash;When lights were brought, the occa&s;ion of all this di&s;turbance &s;oon appeared; which was no other than our fellow lodger, whom we found lying on the floor &s;cratching his head, with a look te&s;tifying the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, at the concour&s;e of apparitions that &s;urrounded him.&mdash;This hone&s;t gentleman was, it &s;eems, a recruiting &s;erjeant, who having li&s;ted two country fellows over-night, dreamed they had mutinied, and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along him.&mdash;This made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his imagination, that he got up in his &s;leep, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as above.&mdash;When our ap|prehen&s;ion of danger vani&s;hed, the company be|held one another with great &s;urprize and mirth; but what attracted the notice of every one, was our landlady with nothing on her but her &s;hift and a large pair of buckskin breeches with the back&s;ide before, which &s;he had &s;lipt on in the hurry, and her hu&s;band with her petticoat about his &s;houlders: one had wrapt him&s;elf in a blan|ket, another was covered with a &s;heet, and the drummer who had given his only &s;hirt to be wa&s;hed, appeared in <HI>querpo</HI> with the bol&s;ter rolled about his middle.&mdash;When this affair was di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, every body retired to his own apartment, the &s;erjeant &s;lipt into bed, and my companion and I &s;lept without any further di&s;turbance till the morning, when we got up, went to breakfa&s;t, paid our reckoning, and &s;et forward in expecta|tion of overtaking the waggon; in which, how|ever, we were di&s;appointed that day. As we

exerted our&s;elves more than u&s;ual, I found my&s;elf quite &s;pent with fatigue, when we entered a &s;mall village in the twilight. We enquired for a publick hou&s;e, and were directed to one of a very &s;orry appearance. At our entrance the landlord, who &s;eemed to be a venerable old man, with long grey hair, ro&s;e from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchin, and with a chearful countenance acco&s;ted us in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Salvete Pueri&mdash;ingredimini.</HI>"&mdash;</Q>I was not a lit|tle plea&s;ed to hear our ho&s;t &s;peak Latin, becau&s;e I was in hopes of recommending my&s;elf to him by my knowledge in that language; I therefore an|&s;wered without he&s;itation,&mdash;<HI>Di&s;&s;olve frigus, ligna &s;uper foco.&mdash;large reponens.</HI>&mdash;I had no &s;ooner pro|nounced the&s;e words, than the old gentleman run|ing towards me, &s;hook me by the hand, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&mdash;<HI>Fili mi dilecti&s;&s;ime! unde venis!&mdash;a &s;uperis, ni fallor?</HI>"&mdash;</Q>in &s;hort, finding we were both read in the cla&s;&s;icks, he did not know how to te&s;tify his regard, but ordered his daughter, a jolly ro&s;y|cheeked dam&s;el, who was his &s;ole dome&s;tic, to bring us a bottle of his <HI>quadrimum.</HI>&mdash;repeating from Horace at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Deprome quadrimum &s;abin&acirc;, O thaliarche, merum diot&acirc;.</HI>"</Q> This <HI>quadrimum</HI> was excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told us he had always an <HI>amphora</HI> four years old, for the u&s;e of him&s;elf and friends.&mdash;In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, which was interlarded with &s;craps of Latin, we under&s;tood that this facetious per&s;on was a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who&s;e income being &s;mall, he was fain to keep a gla&s;s of good liquor for the entertainment of pa&s;&s;engers, by which he made &s;hift to make the two ends of the year meet.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am this day, &s;aid he, the happie&s;t old fellow in his maje&s;ty's

<ARGUMENT>
<P>We de&s;cry the waggon&mdash;get into it&mdash;arrive at an inn&mdash;our fellow travellers de&s;cribed&mdash;a mi&s;take is committed by Strap, which produces &s;trange things.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE travelled half a mile without exchanging one word; my thoughts being engro&s;&s;ed by the knavery of the world, to which I mu&s;t be daily expo&s;ed; and the contemplation of my finances, which began &s;en&s;ibly to dimini&s;h.&mdash;At length Strap, who could hold no longer, addre&s;&s;ed me thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, fools and their money are &s;oon parted.&mdash;If my advice had been taken, that old skin-flint &s;hould have been damn'd before he had got more than the third of his demand.&mdash;'Tis a &s;ure &s;ign you came ea&s;i|ly by your money, when you &s;quander it away in this manner.&mdash;Ah! God help you, how many bri&s;ly beards mu&s;t I have mowed before I earned 4 &s;hillings and three pence halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs?&mdash;How many days have I &s;at weaving hair, till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers cramp'd, and my no&s;e as blue as the &s;ign of the peri|wig that hung over the door?&mdash;What the devil was you afraid of? I would have en|gaged to box with any one of tho&s;e fellows who came in, for a guinea.&mdash;I'm &s;ure I have beat &s;touter men than either of them."&mdash;</Q>And indeed, my companion would have fought
<PB N="74" REF="96">
any body, when his life was in no danger; but he had a mortal aver&s;ion to fire arms and all in|&s;truments of death. In order to appea&s;e him, I a&s;&s;ured him, no part of this extraordinary ex|pence &s;hould fall upon his &s;houlders; at which he was affronted, and told me, he would have me to know, that although he was a poor barber's boy, he had a &s;oul to &s;pend his money with the be&s;t '&s;quire of the land.&mdash;Having walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a refre&s;hment, we de&s;cried towards the evening, to our inexpre&s;|&s;ible joy, the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us; and by that time we came up with it, were both of us &s;o weary, that I verily believe it would have been impracticable for us to have walked one mile further.&mdash;We therefore bar|gained with the driver, who&s;e name was Joey, to give us a ca&s;t to the next &s;tage for a &s;hilling; at which place we would meet the ma&s;ter of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the re&s;t of the journey.</P>
<P>Accordingly the convenience &s;topt, and Joey having placed the ladder, Strap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted fir&s;t; but ju&s;t as he was getting in, a tremendous voice a&s;&s;ailed his ears in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God's fury! there &s;hall no pa&s;&s;engers come here."&mdash;</Q>The poor &s;haver was &s;o di&s;concerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant, that he de&s;cended with great velocity, and a countenance as white as paper.&mdash;Joey per|ceiving our a&s;toni&s;hment, called with an arch &s;neer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Waunds, captain! whay woan't yau &s;ooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a pen|ny?&mdash;Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get oop,&mdash;never moind the coptain,&mdash;I'&s;e not
<PB N="75" REF="97">
afear'd of the coptain."&mdash;</Q>This was not encou|ragement &s;ufficient to Strap, who could not be prevailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not without a quaking heart, when I heard the &s;ame voice muttering like di&s;|tant thunder: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By G&mdash;d I won't be u&s;ed &s;o, d&mdash;n&mdash;n &s;eize me if I am!"&mdash;</Q>However I crept in, and by accident got an empty place in the &s;traw, which I immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, without being able to di&s;cern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap following with the knap&s;ack on his back, chanced to take the other &s;ide, and by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the &s;tomach of the captain, who bellowed out in a mo&s;t dreadful manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Blood and thunder! where's my &s;word?"&mdash;</Q>At the&s;e words, my frighted comrade &s;tarted up, and at one &s;pring, bounced again&s;t me with &s;uch force, that I thought the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;on of Anak intended to &s;mother me.&mdash;In the mean time a female voice cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me! what is the matter, my dear?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The matter, replied the captain, damn my blood! my guts are al|mo&s;t &s;queezed out by that Scotchman's hump."</Q> Strap trembling all the while at my back, asked him pardon, and laid the blame of what had hap|pened upon the jolting of the waggon.&mdash;The woman who &s;poke before, went on: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, ay, my dear, it is our own fault&mdash;we may thank our|&s;elves for all the inconveniencies we meet with.&mdash;I thank God, I never travelled &s;o before,&mdash;I'm &s;ure if my lady or Sir John was to know where we are, they would not &s;leep this night for vexation.&mdash;I wi&s;h to God we had writ for the chariot,&mdash;I know we &s;hall never be forgiven."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, come, my dear (replied the captain)
<PB N="76" REF="98">
it don't &s;ignify fretting now,&mdash;we &s;hall laugh it over as a frolick.&mdash;I hope you will not &s;uf|fer in your health.&mdash;I &s;hall make my lord ve|ry merry with our adventures in the <HI>Dili|gence.</HI>"&mdash;</Q>This di&s;cour&s;e gave me &s;uch a high notion of the captain and his lady, that I dur&s;t not venture to join in the conver&s;ation; but im|mediately after, another female voice begins: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Some people give them&s;elves a great many needle&s;s airs&mdash;better folks than any here have travelled in waggons before now.&mdash;Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind them, without making &s;o much fu&s;s about it.&mdash;What then? we are now all upon a footing, there|fore let us be &s;ociable and merry.&mdash;What do you &s;ay, I&s;aac? Is'n't this a good motion, you doting rogue?&mdash;Speak, you old <HI>cent. per cent.</HI> fornicator.&mdash;What de&s;perate debt are you thinking of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, I&s;aac, po&s;itively you &s;hall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf; grow hone&s;t, and live like a gentleman.&mdash;In the mean time, give me a ki&s;s, you old fumbler."&mdash;</Q>The&s;e words, accompanied with a hearty &s;mack, enlivened the per&s;on to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, to &s;uch a degree, that he cried in tran&s;port, tho' with a quavering voice, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah! you wanton baggage&mdash;upon my credit, you are a waggi&s;h girl, he, he, he."&mdash;</Q>This laugh introduced a fit of coughing, which almo&s;t &s;uffocated the poor u&s;urer (&s;uch, we afterwards found, was the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of this our fellow-traveller.)&mdash;About this time, I fell a&s;leep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till &s;uch time as we arrived at the inn where we put up.&mdash;Here, having got out of the waggon
<PB N="77" REF="99">
fir&s;t, I had an opportunity of viewing the pa&s;&s;en|gers in order as they entered.&mdash;The fir&s;t who ap|peared was a brisk airy girl, about twenty years old, with a &s;ilver-laced hat on her head, in&s;tead of a cap, a blue &s;tuff riding &s;uit trimmed with &s;ilver, very much tarni&s;hed, and a whip in her hand.&mdash;After her, came limping, an old man with a wor&s;ted night-cap, buttoned under his chin, and a broad brimmed hat &s;louched over it, an old ru&s;ty blue cloak tied about his neck, under which appeared a brown &s;urtout, that covered a thread|bare coat and wa&s;te-coat, and, as we afterwards di&s;cerned, a dirty flannel jacket.&mdash;His eyes were hollow, bleared and gummy; his face was &s;hri|velled into a thou&s;and wrinkles, his gums were de&s;titute of teeth, his no&s;e &s;harp and droop|ing, his chin peeked and prominent, &s;o that when he mumped or &s;poke, they approached one ano|ther like a pair of nut-crackers; he &s;upported him|&s;elf on an ivory-headed cane, and his whole fi|gure was a ju&s;t emblem of winter, famine and a|varice.&mdash;But how was I &s;urprized, when I beheld the formidable captain leading in his wife; in the &s;hape of a little, thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long, withered vi&s;age, very much re&s;embling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which, two little grey eyes peeped: He wore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump, which immoderate length, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the occa&s;ion of a baldne&s;s that appeared on the crown of his head, when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very much of the &s;ize and cock of Pi&s;tol's.&mdash;Having laid a&s;ide his great coat, I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: He was about five foot and three inches high, &s;ixteen inches of
<PB N="78" REF="100">
which went to his face and long &s;craggy neck; his thighs were about &s;ix inches in length, his legs re&s;embling &s;pindles or drum-&s;ticks, two feet and an half, and his body, which put me in mind of exten&s;ion without &s;ub&s;tance, engro&s;&s;ed the re|mainder;&mdash;&s;o that on the whole, he appeared like a &s;pider or gra&s;hopper erect,&mdash;and was almo&s;t a <HI>vox &amp; preterca nihil.</HI>&mdash;His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in a frock of what is called bear-skin, the skirts of which were about half a foot long, an Hu&s;&s;ar wai&s;tcoat, &s;carlet breeches reaching half way down his thigh, wor&s;ted &s;tockings rolled up al|mo&s;t to his groin, and &s;hoes with wooden heels at lea&s;t two inches high; he carried a &s;word very near as long as him&s;elf in one hand, and in the other conducted his lady, who &s;eemed to be a woman of his own age, and &s;till retained &s;ome remains of an agreeable per&s;on; but &s;o ridicu|lou&s;ly affected, that had I then known as much of the world as I do now, I might have ea&s;ily perceived in her, the deplorable vanity and &s;e|cond-hand airs of a lady's woman.&mdash;We were all a&s;&s;embled in the kitchen, when captain Weazel (for that was his name) de&s;ired a room with a fire for him&s;elf and &s;pou&s;e; and told the landlord, they would &s;up by them&s;elves.&mdash;The inn-keeper replied, that he could not afford them a room by them&s;elves; and as for &s;upping, he had prepared victuals for the pa&s;&s;engers in the waggon without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, but if he could pre|vail on the re&s;t to let him have his choice in a &s;eparate manner, with all his heart: This was no &s;ooner &s;aid, than all of us declared again&s;t the propo&s;al, and mi&s;s Jenny (our other female pa&s;|&s;enger) ob&s;erved, that if captain Weazel and his lady had a mind to &s;up by them&s;elves, they might
<PB N="79" REF="101">
wait until we &s;hould have done.&mdash;At this, the captain put on a martial frown and looked very big, without &s;peaking; while his yoke-fel|low, with a di&s;dainful to&s;s of her no&s;e, muttered &s;omething about <Q REND="inline">"Creature;"&mdash;</Q>which mi&s;s Jen|ny over-hearing, &s;tept up to her, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"None of your names, good Mrs. Abigail;&mdash;creature quotha,&mdash;I'll a&s;&s;ure you,&mdash;No &s;uch creature as you neither&mdash;no ten pound &s;neaker&mdash;no quality coupler."&mdash;</Q>Here the captain inter|po&s;ed with a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Damme, madam, what d'ye mean by that?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Damn you, &s;ir, who are you? (replied mi&s;s Jenny) who made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher-&s;craping, pimp|ing curler?&mdash;'Sdeath! the army is come to a fine pa&s;s, when &s;uch fellows as you get com|mi&s;&s;ions.&mdash;What, I &s;uppo&s;e you think I don't know you?&mdash;By G&mdash;d, you and your help|mate are well met,&mdash;a ca&s;t-off mi&s;tre&s;s, and a bald <HI>valet de chambre</HI> are well yoked together.

Fury and de&s;truction!

<P>NEXT morning, I agreed to give the ma&s;|ter of the waggon ten &s;hillings for my pa&s;&s;age to London, provided Strap &s;hould be al|lowed to take my place when I &s;hould be di&s;|po&s;ed to walk.&mdash;At the &s;ame time I de&s;ired him to appea&s;e the incen&s;ed captain, who by this time had got into the kitchen, with a drawn &s;word in his hand, and threatned with many oaths, to &s;acrifice the villain, who attempted to violate his bed; but it was to no purpo&s;e for the ma&s;ter to explain the mi&s;take, and a&s;&s;ure him of the poor lad's innocence, who &s;tood trembling behind me all the while: the more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that appeared in Strap, the more implacable &s;eemed the re&s;ent|ment of Weazel, who &s;wore he mu&s;t either fight him, or he would in&s;tantly put him to death.&mdash;I was extremely provoked at this in&s;olence, and told him, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the &s;word at his own

While he was in this &s;itua|tion, his wife entered, and &s;eeing her husband in the&s;e dangerous circum&s;tances, uttered a dread|ful &s;cream, and &s;wooned: Upon this, Weazel de|manded a ce&s;&s;ation, which was immediately granted; and after his lady had recovered, was contented with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Strap, who fal|ling on his knees before him, prote&s;ted the inno|cence of his intention, and asked pardon for the mi&s;take he had committed. This affair being ended without blood&s;hed, we went to breakfa&s;t, but mi&s;&s;ed two of our company, to wit, mi&s;s Jenny and the u&s;urer.

<P>Strap and I are terrified by an apparition&mdash;Strap's conjecture&mdash;the my&s;tery explained by Joey&mdash;we arrive at London&mdash;our dre&s;s and appearance de&s;cribed&mdash;we are in|&s;ulted in the &s;treet&mdash;an adventure in the ale-hou&s;e&mdash;we are impo&s;ed upon by a wag|gi&s;h footman&mdash;&s;et to rights by a tobacconi&s;t&mdash;take lodgings&mdash;dive for a dinner&mdash;an ac|cident at our ordinary.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE arrived at our inn, &s;upped and went to bed; but Strap's di&s;temper continuing, he was obliged to get up in the middle of the night, and taking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the purpo&s;e, he went down to the hou&s;e of office; whence in a &s;hort time he returned in a great hurry, with his hair &s;tanding on end, and a look betokening horror and a&s;toni&s;hment. Without &s;peaking a word, he &s;et down the light, and jumped into bed be|hind me, where he lay and trembled with great violence.&mdash;When I a&s;ked him what was the mat|ter? he replied, with a broken accent, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God have mercy on us! I have &s;een the devil."&mdash;</Q>Though my prejudice was not quite &s;o &s;trong as his, I was not a little alarmed at this exclama|tion, and much more &s;o, when I heard the &s;ound of bells approaching our chamber, and felt my bedfellow cling clo&s;e to me, uttering the&s;e words,
<PB N="95" REF="117">
Chri&s;t have mercy upon us! there he comes.&mdash;At that in&s;tant, a mon&s;trous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with bells at its feet, and made directly towards our bed.&mdash;As this creature is reckoned in our country, a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and in a vio|lent fright, &s;hrunk my head under the bed-cloaths.&mdash;This terrible apparition leapt upon the bed, and after giving us &s;everal &s;evere dabbs with its beak through the blankets, hopped away, and vani&s;hed. Strap and I recommended our&s;elves to the pro|tection of heaven with great devotion, and when we no longer heard the noi&s;e, ventured to peep up and take breath.&mdash;But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another appeared, that had well nigh deprived us both of our &s;en&s;es. We perceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that reached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance, that did not &s;avour of this world: and his dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a brown &s;tuff coat, buttoned behind, and at the wri&s;ts, and an odd-fa&s;hioned cap of the &s;ame &s;tuff upon his head.&mdash;I was &s;o amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from &s;uch a gha&s;tly object, but lay motionle&s;s, and &s;aw him come &s;treight up to me: when he got to the bed, he wrung his hands, and cried with a voice that did not &s;eem to be|long to a human creature, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where is Ralph?"</Q> I made no reply; upon which, he repeated in an accent &s;till more preternatural; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where is Ralpho?"&mdash;</Q>He had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than I heard the &s;ound of the bells at a di&s;tance; which the apparition having li&s;tened to, tript away, and left me almo&s;t petrified with
<PB N="96" REF="118">
fear. It was a good while before I could recover my&s;elf &s;o far as to &s;peak: and when at length I turned about to Strap, I found him in a fit, which, however, did not la&s;t long.&mdash;When he came to him&s;elf, I a&s;ked his opinion of what had happened; and he a&s;&s;ured me, that the fir&s;t mu&s;t certainly be the &s;oul of &s;ome per&s;on damned, which appeared by the chains about its legs (for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigne&s;s of a hor&s;e, and the &s;ound of &s;mall morris bells to the clanking of ma&s;&s;y chains)&mdash;As for the old man, he took it to be the &s;pirit of &s;omebody murdered long ago in this place, which had power granted it to torment the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in the &s;hape of a raven, and that Rapho was the name of the &s;aid murderer.&mdash;Although I had not much faith in his interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any &s;leep; and in all my future adventures, never pa&s;&s;ed a night &s;o ill.&mdash;In the morning, Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who after an immoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him that the old man was the landlord's father, who had turned idiot &s;ome years ago, and diverted him&s;elf with a tame ra|ven, which, it &s;eems, had hopped away from his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow it to our chamber, where he had in|quired after it, under the name of Ralpho.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened during the re|maining part of our journey, which continued &s;ix or &s;even days longer: At length we entered the great city, and lodged all night at the inn, where the waggon halted.&mdash;Next morning, all the pa&s;&s;engers parted different ways; while my com|panion and I &s;allied out to enquire for the member of parliament to whom I had a letter of recom|mendation
<PB N="97" REF="119">
from Mr. Crab. As we had di&s;|charged our lodging at the inn, Strap took up our baggage, and marched behind me in the &s;treet with the knap&s;ack on his back, as u&s;ual, &s;o that we made a very whim&s;ical appearance.&mdash;I had dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the greate&s;t advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled &s;hirt, my be&s;t thread &s;tockings, my hair (which was of the deepe&s;t red) hung down upon my &s;houlders, as lank and &s;treight as a pound of candles; and the &s;kirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my wai&s;tcoat and breeches were of the &s;ame piece, and cut in the &s;ame ta&s;te; my hat very much re&s;embled a Barber's ba&s;on in the &s;hallow|ne&s;s of the crown and narrowne&s;s of the brims. Strap was habited in a much le&s;s aukward man|ner than me; but a &s;hort crop eared wig that very much re&s;embled Scrub's in the play, and the knap&s;ack on his back, added to what is called a queer phiz, occa&s;ioned by a long chin, an hook no&s;e, and high cheek bones, rendered him on the whole a very fit &s;ubject of mirth and plea|&s;antry. As we walked along, Strap, at my de|&s;ire, enquired of a carman whom we met, where|abouts Mr. Cringer lived;&mdash;and was an&s;wered by a &s;tare accompanied with the word, <Q REND="inline">"Anan!"</Q> Upon which I came up in order to explain the que&s;tion, but had the misfortune to be unintelli|gible likewi&s;e, the carman damning us for a lou&s;y Scotch guard, and whipping up his hor&s;es with a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gee ho!"</Q> which nettled me to the quick, and rou&s;ed the indignation of Strap &s;o far, that after the fellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a farthing.&mdash;While we were deliberating what was next to be done, an hack|ney coachman driving &s;oftly along, and perceiving
<PB N="98" REF="120">
us &s;tanding by the kennel, came up clo&s;e to us, and calling, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A coach, ma&s;ter!"</Q> by a dexte|rous management of the reins, made his hor&s;es &s;tumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over with mud.&mdash;After which, he drove on, applauding him&s;elf with a hearty laugh, in which &s;everal people joined, to my great mortification; but one more compa&s;&s;ionate than the re&s;t &s;eeing us &s;trangers, advi&s;ed me to go into an ale-hou&s;e, and dry my|&s;elf. I thanked him for his advice, which I im|mediately complied with; and going into the hou&s;e he pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and &s;at down by the fire in a public room, where we cleaned our&s;elves as well as we could&mdash;In the mean time, a wag who &s;at in a box, &s;moaking his pipe, under&s;tanding by our dialect who we were, came up to me, and, with a very grave countenance, a&s;ked me, how long I had been caught? As I did not know the meaning of his que&s;tion, I made no an&s;wer; and he went on, &s;aying, it could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet cut; at the &s;ame time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to the re&s;t of the company, which &s;eemed highly entertained with his wit.&mdash;I was incen&s;ed at this u&s;age, but afraid of re&s;enting it, becau&s;e I happened to be in a &s;trange place, and perceived the per&s;on who &s;poke to me, was a brawny fellow, for whom I was by no means a match. However, Strap ha|ving either more courage or le&s;s caution, could not put up with the in&s;ults that I &s;uffered; but told him with a peremptory tone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was an uncivil fellow, for making &s;o free with his bet|ters."&mdash;</Q>Whereupon, the wit going toward him, a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What he had got in his knap|&s;ack?"</Q> Is it oat-meal or brim&s;tone, Sawney?

(&s;aid he) &s;eizing him by the chin, which he &s;hook to the inexpre&s;&s;ible diver&s;ion of all pre&s;ent.&mdash;My companion feeling him&s;elf a&s;&s;aulted in &s;uch an op|probrious manner, di&s;engaged him&s;elf in a trice, and lent his antagoni&s;t &s;uch a box on the ear, as made him &s;tagger to the other &s;ide of the room; and in a moment, a ring was formed for the combatants.&mdash;Seeing Strap beginning to &s;trip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which bani&s;hed all other thoughts, I undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the skin in an in&s;tant, and declared, that as the affront that occa&s;ioned the quarrel was offered to me, I would fight it out my&s;elf; upon which one or two cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That's a brave Scotch boy; you &s;hall have fair play, by G&mdash;d."</Q> This gave me fre&s;h &s;pirits, and going up to my adver|&s;ary, who by his pale countenance, did not &s;eem much inclined to the battle, I &s;truck him &s;o hard on the &s;tomach that he reeled over a bench, and fell to the ground. Here I attempted to get a-top of him in order to improve my &s;ucce&s;s, ac|cording to the manner of my own country; but was re&s;trained by the &s;pectators, one of whom endeavoured to rai&s;e up my opponent, but in vain; for he prote&s;ted he would not fight, not being quite recovered of a late illne&s;s.&mdash;I was very well plea&s;ed with this excu&s;e, and immediately dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery, as did al&s;o my com|rade Strap, who &s;hook me by the hand and wi&s;hed me joy of the victory.&mdash;After having drank our pot, and dried our cloaths, we enquired of the landlord if he knew Mr. Cringer the member of parliament, and were amazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined, he mu&s;t be
<PB N="100" REF="122">
every bit as con&s;picuous here, as in the borough he repre&s;ented; but he told us we might po&s;&s;ibly hear of him as we pa&s;&s;ed along.&mdash;Whereupon we betook our&s;elves to the &s;treet, where, &s;eeing a footman &s;tanding at a door, we made up to him, and asked if he knew where our patron lived.&mdash;This member of the party-coloured &s;raternity, &s;urveying us both very minutely, &s;aid he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bid us turn down the fir&s;t &s;treet on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the left again, after which we would ob&s;erve a lane, through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s, and at the other end we &s;hould find an alley that leads to another &s;treet, where we &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ign of the thi&s;tle and three pedlars, and there he lodged.&mdash;We thanked him for his information, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this per&s;on to be an hone&s;t friendly man by his countenance, before he opened his mouth; in which opinion I acquie&s;ced, a&s;cribing his good manners to the company he daily &s;aw in the hou&s;e where he &s;erved.&mdash;We followed his di|rections punctually, in turning to the left and to the right, and to the left again; but in&s;tead of &s;eeing a lane before us, we found our&s;elves at the &s;ide of the river, which perplexed us not a little; and my fellow traveller ventured to pro|nounce, that we had certainly mi&s;&s;ed our way.&mdash;By this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I went into a &s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ll &s;nuff-&s;hop hard by, encouraged by the &s;ign of the highlander, where I found, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, the &s;hop-keeper my countryman.&mdash;He was no &s;ooner informed of our peregrination, and the directions we had re|ceived
<PB N="101" REF="123">
from the footman, than he informed us we had been impo&s;ed upon, telling us, that Mr. Cringer lived in the other end of the town; and that it would be to no purpo&s;e for us to go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the Hou&s;e.&mdash;I then asked him if he could recommend us to a lodging, which he readily did, by giving us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler's &s;hop not far from St. Martin's Lane; here we hired a bed-room, up two pair of &s;tairs, at the rate of 2<HI>s. per</HI> week, &s;o very &s;mall, that when the bed was let down, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that be|longed to the apartment, and u&s;e the bed&s;tead by way of chairs.&mdash;About dinner-time, our land|lord asked us how we propo&s;ed to live, to which we an&s;wered, that we would be directed by him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well then (&s;ays he) there are two ways of eating in this town, for people of your con|dition; the one more creditable and expen&s;ive than the other: the fir&s;t, is to dine at an eat|ing-hou&s;e frequented by well dre&s;&s;ed people only, and the other is called diving, practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally."&mdash;</Q>I gave him to under&s;tand that provided the la&s;t was not infamous, it would &s;uit much better with our circum&s;tances than the o|ther.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Infamous (cried he) God forbid, there are many creditable people, and rich people, ay and fine people, that dive every day.&mdash;I have &s;een many a pretty gentleman bedaubed all over with lace, dine in that manner, very comfor|tably for three pence half-penny, and go after|wards to the coffee-hou&s;e, where he made a figure with the be&s;t lord in the land;&mdash;but

While he entertained the company in this manner, with an eloquence peculiar to him&s;elf, the cook got up, and after a hearty cur&s;e on the poor author of this mi&s;chance, who lay under the table &s;cratching his rump with a woful countenance, emptied a &s;alt|&s;eller in her hand, and &s;tripping down the pa|tient's &s;tocking which brought the skin along with it, applied the contents to the &s;ore.&mdash;This poultice was &s;carce laid on, when the drummer, who had
<PB N="103" REF="125">
begun to abate of his exclamation, broke forth into &s;uch a hideous yell, as made the whole com|pany tremble; then &s;eizing a pewter pint-pot that &s;tood by him, &s;queezed the &s;ides of it together, as if it had been made of pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the &s;ame time with a mo&s;t horrible grin. Gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of this violent tran&s;port, I bid the woman wa&s;h off the &s;alt, and bathe the part with oil, which &s;he did, and procured him immediate ea&s;e. But here another difficulty oc|curred, which was no other than the landlady's in&s;i&s;ting on his paying for the pot he had ren|dered u&s;ele&s;s; he &s;wore he would pay for nothing but what he had eat, and bid her be thankful for his moderation, or el&s;e he would pro&s;ecute her for damages.&mdash;Strap fore&s;eeing it would all land at him, promi&s;ed to &s;atisfy the cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer with, which entirely appea&s;ed him, and compo&s;ed all animo&s;ities. After this our landlord and we &s;at down at a board, and dined upon &s;hin of beef mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly; our reckoning amounting to two pence halfpenny each, bread and &s;mall beer included.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the afternoon, my companion propo&s;ed to to call at his friend's hou&s;e, which, we were informed, was in the neighbourhood, whither we accordingly went, and were &s;o lucky as to find him at home. This gentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years ago, kept a &s;chool in town, where he taught the Latin, French and Italian languages; but what he chief|ly profe&s;&s;ed was the pronounciation of the Engli&s;h tongue, after a method more &s;peedy and uncom|mon than any practi&s;ed heretofore; and indeed if his &s;cholars &s;poke like their ma&s;ter, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle; for although I could ea&s;ily under&s;tand every word of what I had heard hitherto &s;ince I entered Eng|land, three parts in four of his dialect were as un|intelligible to me, as if he had &s;poke in Arabick or Iri&s;h.&mdash;He was a middle-&s;ized man, and &s;tooped very much, though not above the age of forty; his face was very much pitted with the &s;mall-pox, his eyes blear'd, and his mouth ex|tended from ear to ear.&mdash;He was dre&s;&s;ed in a
<PB N="105" REF="127">
night-gown of plaid, fa&s;tened about his middle with a &s;erjeant's old &s;a&s;h, and a tie-perriwig with a fore-top three inches high, in the fa&s;hion of king Charles the &s;econd's reign.&mdash;After he had received Strap (who was related to him) very courteou&s;ly, he enquired of him, who I was: and being informed, took me by the hand, telling me, he was at &s;chool with my father.&mdash;When he under&s;tood my &s;ituation, he a&s;&s;ured me that he would do me all the &s;ervice in his power, both by his advice and otherwi&s;e; and while he &s;poke the&s;e words, he eyed me with great attention, walking round me &s;everal times, and muttering, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Ch&mdash;&s;t! O Ch&mdash;&s;t! fat a &s;aight is here?"&mdash;</Q>I &s;oon gue&s;&s;ed the rea&s;on of of his ejaculation, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir, you are not plea&s;ed with my dre&s;s."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dre&s;s, (an&s;wered he) you may caal it fat you plea&s;e, in your country, but I vaw to Gad, 'tis a ma&s;querade here.&mdash;No chri&s;tian will admit &s;uch a figure into his haw&s;e.&mdash;Upon my con|&s;cience! I wonder the dogs did not hunt you.&mdash;Did you pa&s;s through St. James's market?&mdash;God ble&s;s my eye-&s;aight! you look like a cou&s;in-german of Ouran Outang."&mdash;</Q>I began to be a little &s;erious at this di&s;cour&s;e, and asked him, if he thought I &s;hould obtain entrance to|morrow at the hou&s;e Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended, for an introduction into bu&s;i|ne&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Cringer, Mr. Cringer (replied he, &s;cratching his cheek) may be a very hone&s;t gentleman&mdash;I know nothing to the contrary; but is your &s;ole dependance upon him?&mdash;Who recommended you to him?"&mdash;</Q>I pulled out Mr. Crab's letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes; at which he &s;tared at me, and re|peated,
<PB N="106" REF="128">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O Ch&mdash;&s;t!"&mdash;</Q>I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me with his advice; which he pro|mi&s;ed to do very frankly; and as a &s;pecimen, di|rected us to a perriwig ware-hou&s;e, in the neigh|bourhood, in order to be accommodated; laying &s;trong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr. Cringer, till I had parted with the&s;e carroty locks, which (he &s;aid) were &s;ufficient to beget an antipathy again&s;t me, in all mankind.&mdash;And as we were going to pur&s;ue this advice, he called me back, and bid me be &s;ure to deliver my let|ter into Mr. Cringer's own hand.&mdash;As we walked along, Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend, who (it &s;eems) had a&s;&s;ured him, he would in a day or two provide for him, with &s;ome good ma&s;ter; and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"now (&s;ays he) you &s;hall &s;ee how I will fit you with a wig&mdash;There's ne'er a barber in London (and that's a bold word) can palm a rotten caul, or a penny-weight of dead hair upon me."&mdash;</Q>And indeed this zealous adherent did wrangle &s;o long with the merchant, that he was de&s;ired twenty times to leave the &s;hop, and &s;ee if he could get one cheaper el&s;ewhere. At length I made choice of a good hand&s;ome bob, for which I paid fifteen &s;hillings; and returned to our lodging, where Strap, in a moment, rid me of that hair which had given the &s;chool-ma&s;ter &s;o much offence.</P>
<P>We got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave audience by candle-light to all his dependants, he him&s;elf be|ing obliged to attend the levee of my lord Ter|rier, at break of day; becau&s;e his lord&s;hip made one at the mini&s;ter's between eight and nine a|clock.&mdash;When we came to Mr. Cringer's door,

<PB N="114" REF="136">
again&s;t him, who had refu&s;ed me a little money to attempt to retrieve it. I therefore, turned towards him with a &s;tern countenance, and asked him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who he called fool!"</Q> Being altogether unaccu&s;tomed with &s;uch looks from me, he &s;tood &s;till and &s;tared in my face for &s;ome time; then, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, uttered <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fool!&mdash;I called no body fool but my&s;elf;&mdash;I am &s;ure, I am the greate&s;t fool of the two, for being &s;o much concerned at other people's misfortunes;&mdash;but <HI>Nemo omnibus horis &s;apit.</HI>&mdash;that's all&mdash;that's all."&mdash;</Q>Upon which a &s;ilence en&s;ued that brought us to our lodging, where I threw my|&s;elf into the bed in an agony of de&s;pair, re&s;olv|ing to peri&s;h for want, rather than apply to my companion or any other body for relief; but Strap, who knew my temper, and who&s;e heart bled within him at my di&s;tre&s;s, after &s;ome pau&s;e, came to the bed-&s;ide, and putting a leather pur&s;e into my hand, bur&s;t into tears, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know what you think: but I &s;corn your thoughts.&mdash;There's all I have in the world, take it, and I'll perhaps get more for you be|fore that be done&mdash;if not, I'll beg for you, &s;teal for you, go through the wide world with you, and &s;tarve with you, for though I be a poor cobler's &s;on, I am no &s;cout."&mdash;</Q>I was &s;o touched with the generous pa&s;&s;ion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from weeping al&s;o, and we mingled our tears together for &s;ome time.&mdash;Upon examining the pur&s;e, I found in it two half guineas and half a crown, which I would have returned to him, &s;aying, he knew better than I how to manage it; but he ab&s;olute|ly refu&s;ed my propo&s;al, and told me, it was more rea&s;onable and decent that he &s;hould depend upon

me who was a gentleman, than that I &s;hould be controuled by him.</P>
<P>After this friendly conte&s;t was over, and our minds more at ea&s;e, we informed our landlord of what had happened to us, taking care to conceal the extremity to which we were reduced: He no &s;ooner heard the &s;tory, than he a&s;&s;ured us we had been grievou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon by a couple of &s;harpers, who were a&s;&s;ociates; and that this po|lite, hone&s;t, friendly, humane per&s;on, who had treated us &s;o civilly, was no other than a ra&s;cally money-dropper, who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to de|coy &s;trangers in that manner, to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice or two was always waiting to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pillaging the prey they had run down.&mdash;Here the good man recounted a great many &s;tories of people who had been &s;e|duced, cheated, pilfered, beat,&mdash;nay, even murdered by &s;uch villains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedne&s;s of mankind, and Strap li&s;ting up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from &s;cenes of &s;uch iniquity; for &s;urely the devil had &s;et up his throne in London.&mdash;Our landlord being curious to know what reception we had met with at Mr. Cringer's, we acquainted him with the particulars, at which he &s;hook his head, and told us, we had not gone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a m&mdash;b&mdash;r of p&mdash;m&mdash;t without a bribe: that the &s;ervant was commonly infected with the ma&s;ter's di&s;ea&s;e, and expected to be paid for his work, as well as his betters.&mdash;He there|fore advi&s;ed me to give the footman a &s;hilling the next time I de&s;ired admittance to my patron, or el&s;e I &s;hould &s;carce find an opportunity to de|liver my letter. Accordingly, next morning,
<PB N="116" REF="138">
when the door was opened, I &s;lipt a &s;hilling into his hand, and told him I had a letter for his ma&s;ter.&mdash;I found the good effects of my libera|lity; for the fellow let me in immediately, and taking the letter out of my hand, de&s;ired me to wait in a kind of pa&s;&s;age, for an an&s;wer. In this place I continued &s;tanding three quarters of an hour, during which time I &s;aw a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scot|land, pa&s;s and repa&s;s, with an air of familiarity in their way to and from the audience chamber: while I was fain to &s;tand &s;hivering in the cold, and turn my back to them, that they might not perceive the lowne&s;s of my condition.&mdash;At length, Mr. Cringer came out to &s;ee a young gentleman to the door, who was no other than '&s;quire Gawky, dre&s;&s;ed in a very gay &s;uit of cloaths: At parting Mr. Cringer &s;hook him by the hand, and told him he hoped to have the plea&s;ure of his company at dinner. Then turning about towards me, asked what were my commands: when he under&s;tood I was the per&s;on who had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to recollect my name, which however, he pretended he could not do, till he had con&s;ulted the letter again; to &s;ave him that trouble, I told him my name was Random.&mdash;Upon which he went on, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, ay, Random, Random, Random&mdash;I think I remember the name;"</Q> and very well he might, for this very individual Mr. Cringer had many a time rode before my grand|father's cloak-bag, in quality of footman.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, (&s;ays he) you propo&s;e to go on board a man of war, as &s;urgeon's mate."</Q> To which I replied by a low bow. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe it will be a difficult matter (continued he) to procure a

<P>At my return, I was &s;urprized with the agree|able news of Strap's being employed on the re|commendation of his friend the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, by a perriwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> week, be&s;ides bed and board.&mdash;I continued to dance attendance every other morning at the lev&eacute;e of Mr. Cringer, dur|ing a fortnight, in which time I became acquaint|ed with a young fellow of my own country and profe&s;&s;ion, who al&s;o depended on the mem|ber's intere&s;t; but was treated with much more re&s;pect than I, both by the &s;ervants and ma&s;ter, being often admitted into a parlour, where there was a fire, for the convenience of the better &s;ort of tho&s;e who waited for him.&mdash;Thither I was never permitted to penetrate on account of my appearance, which was not at all fa&s;hionable; but was obliged to &s;tand blowing my fingers in a cold lobby, and take the fir&s;t opportunity of Mr. Cringer's going to the door, to &s;peak with him.&mdash;One day, while I enjoyed this occa&s;ion, a per&s;on was introduced, whom Mr. Cringer no

&s;ooner &s;aw, then running towards him, he &s;aluted him with a bow to the very ground, and after|wards &s;haking him by the hand with great hearti|ne&s;s and familiarity, called him his good friend, and asked very kindly how Mrs. Staytape, and the young ladies did; then, after a whi&s;per which continued &s;ome minutes, wherein I over-heard the word <HI>Honour</HI> repeated &s;everal times with great empha&s;is, Mr. Cringer introduced me to this gentleman, as to a per&s;on who&s;e advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance I might depend upon, and having given me his direction, followed me to the door, where he told me, I needed not give my&s;elf the trouble to call at his hou&s;e any more, for Mr. Staytape would do my bu&s;ine&s;s for me. At that in&s;tant my fellow dependant coming out after me, over-heard the di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Cringer, and making up to me in the &s;treet, acco&s;ted me very civilly, which I looked upon as no &s;mall honour, con&s;idering the figure he made; for he was dre&s;&s;ed in a blue frock with a gold button, a green &s;ilk wai&s;tcoat trim|med with gold, black velvet breeches, white &s;ilk &s;tockings, &s;ilver buckles, a gold-laced hat, a &s;pen|cer wig, and a &s;ilver hilted hanger, with a fine clouded cane in his hand.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I perceive (&s;ays he) you are but lately come from Scotland:&mdash;pray what may your bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Cringer be?&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e it is no &s;ecret&mdash;and I may po&s;&s;ibly give you &s;ome advice that will be &s;erviceable; for I have been &s;urgeon's &s;econd mate on board of a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip, and con&s;equently know a good deal of the world."&mdash;</Q>I made no &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e my &s;ituation, which when he had learned, he &s;hook his head, and told me he had been pretty much in the &s;ame circum&s;tances about a year ago; that he had relied on Cringer's pro|mi&s;es

&s;o long, that his money (which was con&s;i|derable) as well as his credit, was quite exhau&s;ted; and when he wrote to his relations for a fre&s;h &s;up|ply, in&s;tead of money, he received nothing but reproaches, and the epithets of idle, debauched fellow: That after he had waited at the Navy-Office many months for a warrant, to no pur|po&s;e, he was fain to pawn &s;ome of his cloaths, which rai&s;ed him a &s;mall &s;um, wherewith he bribed the &s;&mdash;t&mdash;y, who &s;oon procured a warrant for him, notwith&s;tanding he had affirmed the &s;ame day, that there was not one vacancy.&mdash;That he had gone on board, where he remained nine months; at the end of which the &s;hip was put out of commi&s;&s;ion, and the company to be paid off in Broad-&s;treet the very next day.&mdash;That his relations being reconcil'd to him, had charg'd him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who had informed them by letter, that his intere&s;t alone had procured the warrant; in obedience to which command, he came to his levee every morning as I &s;aw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful &s;coundrel&mdash;In conclu&s;ion, he a&s;ked me if I had yet pa&s;&s;ed at Surgeon's-Hall?

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the morning I got up and went to the place of rendezvous, where I waited two hours in vain; and was &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t him for breaking his appointment, that I &s;et out for the city by my&s;elf, in hopes of finding the villain, and being reveng'd on him for his perfidy.&mdash;At length I found my&s;elf at the Navy-Office, which I en|tered, and &s;aw crowds of young fellows walking below; many of whom made no better appear|ance than my&s;elf&mdash;I con&s;ulted the phy&s;iognomy of each, and at la&s;t made up to one who&s;e counte|nance I lik'd; and a&s;k'd, if he could in&s;truct me in the form of the letter which was to be &s;ent to the board, to obtain an order for examination: He an&s;wered me in broad Scotch, that he would &s;hew me the copy of what he had wrote for him|&s;elf,
<PB N="123" REF="145">
by the direction of another who knew the form: And accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my peru&s;al; and told me, that if I was ex|peditious, I might &s;end it in to the board before dinner, for they did no bu&s;ine&s;s in the afternoon. He then went with me to a coffee-hou&s;e hard by, where I wrote the letter, which was imme|diately delivered to the me&s;&s;enger; who told me, I might expect an order to-morrow about the &s;ame time.&mdash;Having tran&s;acted this piece of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, my mind was a good deal compos'd; and as I had met with &s;o much civility from this &s;tranger, I de&s;ired further acquaintance with him, fully re&s;olved however, not to be deceived by him &s;o much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau&mdash;He agreed to dine with me at the cook's &s;hop which I frequented; and on our way thither, carried me to 'Change, where I was in &s;ome hopes of finding Mr. Jack&s;on (for that was the name of the per&s;on who had broke his appoint|ment)&mdash;I &s;ought him there to no purpo&s;e, and on our way to the other end of the town, im|parted to my companion his behaviour towards me: Upon which, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he was no &s;tranger to the name of beau Jack+&s;on (&s;o he was called at the Navy-Office) altho' he did not know him per&s;onally; that he had the character of a good-natur'd carele&s;s fellow, who made no &s;cruple of borrowing from any body that would lend; that mo&s;t people who knew him, believed he had a good enough principle at the bottom; but his extravagance was &s;uch, he would probably never have it in his power to manife&s;t the hone&s;ty of his intention.&mdash;This account made me &s;weat for my five &s;hillings, which I neverthele&s;s did not altogether de&s;pair of recovering, provided
<PB N="124" REF="146">
I could find out the debtor.&mdash;This young man likewi&s;e added another circum&s;tance of 'Squire Jack|&s;on's hi&s;tory, which was, that being de&s;titute of all means to equip him for &s;ea, when he receiv'd his la&s;t warrant, he had been recommended to a per&s;on who lent him a little money, after he had &s;igned a will and power, entitling that per&s;on to lift his wages when they &s;hould become due, as al&s;o to inherit his effects in ca&s;e of his death.&mdash;That he was &s;till under the tutorage and direction of that gentleman, who advanced him &s;mall &s;ums from time to time upon this &s;ecurity, at the rate of 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> But at pre&s;ent his credit was very low, becau&s;e his funds would do little more than pay what he had already receiv'd; this moderate intere&s;t included.&mdash;After the &s;tranger (who&s;e name was Thom&s;on) had entertain'd me with this ac|count of Jack&s;on, he inform'd me, that he him|&s;elf had pa&s;&s;ed for a third mate of a third rate, about four months ago; &s;ince which time, he had con&s;tantly attended at the Navy-Office, in hopes of a warrant, having been a&s;&s;ur'd from the beginning, both by a Scotch member and one of the commi&s;&s;ioners to whom the member recom|mended him, that he &s;hould be put into the fir&s;t vacancy; notwith&s;tanding which promi&s;e, he had had the mortification to &s;ee &s;ix or &s;even appointed in the &s;ame &s;tation almo&s;t every week&mdash;that now being utterly impoveri&s;h'd, his &s;ole hope con&s;i&s;ted in the promi&s;e of a friend lately come to town, to lend him a &s;mall matter, for a pre&s;ent to the &s;&mdash;t&mdash;y; without which he was per&s;uaded he might wait a thou&s;and years to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which (I believe) proceeded from the &s;imilitude of our fortunes: We &s;pent the whole day toge|ther;

and as he lived at Wapping. I de&s;ir'd him to take a &s;hare of my bed.&mdash;Next day we re|turned to the Navy-Office, where, after being called before the board and que&s;tion'd about the place of my nativity and education, they order'd a letter to be made out for me, which, upon pay|ing half a crown to the clerk, I receiv'd, and de|liver'd into the hands of the clerk at Surgeon's-Hall, together with a &s;hilling for his trouble in regi&s;tering my name.&mdash;By this time my whole &s;tock was dimini&s;hed to two &s;hillings, and I &s;aw not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of relief, even for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, much le&s;s to enable me to pay the fees at Surgeon's-Hall for my examination, which was to happen in a fortnight.&mdash;In this &s;tate of perplexity, I con&s;ulted Strap, who a&s;&s;ured me, he would pawn every thing he had in the world, even to his razors, before I &s;hould want: but this I ab&s;olutely rejected, telling him, I would a thou|&s;and times rather li&s;t for a &s;oldier, of which I had &s;ome thoughts, than be any longer a burthen to him.&mdash;At the word &s;oldier, he grew pale as death, and begged on his knees, I would think no more of that &s;cheme. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God pre&s;erve us all in our right wits!

<P>WITH the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this faithful adhe|rent, who gave me almo&s;t all the money he earned, I pre&s;erved my half guinea entire, till the day of examination, when I went with a trembling heart to Surgeon's-hall, in order to undergo that ceremony.&mdash;Among a croud of young fellows who walked in the outward hall. I perceived Mr. Jack&s;on, to whom I immediately went up, and enquiring into the &s;tate of his a|mour, under&s;tood it was &s;till undetermined by rea&s;on of his friend's ab&s;ence, and the delay of the recal at Chatham, which put it out of his power to bring it to a conclu&s;ion.&mdash;I then asked what his bu&s;ine&s;s was in this place; to which he replied, he was re&s;olved to have two-&s;trings to his bow, that in ca&s;e the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">iled he might u&s;e the other; and with this view, he was to pa&s;s that night for a higher qualification.&mdash;At that in&s;tant

a young fellow came out from the place of exa|mination, with a pale countenance, his lip qui|vering, and his looks as wild as if he had &s;een a gho&s;t.&mdash;He no &s;ooner appeared, than we all flocked about him with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s to know what reception he had met with; which (after &s;ome pau&s;e) he de&s;cribed, recounting all the que&s;tions they had asked, with the an&s;wers he made. In this manner, we obliged no le&s;s than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was pa&s;t, they did with plea&s;ure, before it fell to my lot: At length the beadle called my name, with a voice that made me tremble, as much as if it had been the la&s;t trumpet: However, there was no remedy, I was conducted into a large hall, where I &s;aw about a dozen of grim faces &s;itting at a long table. One of whom bid me come forward in &s;uch an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my &s;en&s;es.&mdash;The fir&s;t que&s;tion he put to me was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where was you born?"</Q> To which I an&s;wered, In Scotland.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In Scotland (&s;aid he) I know that very well&mdash;we have &s;carce any other countrymen to examine here&mdash;you Scotch|men have over&s;pread us of late as the locu&s;ts did Egypt:&mdash;I ask you in what part of Scot|land was you born?"&mdash;</Q>I named the place of my nativity, which he had never before heard of: He then proceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I &s;erved my time, with the term of my apprentice&s;hip; and when I had in|formed him that I &s;erved three years only, he fell into a violent pa&s;&s;ion; &s;wore it was a &s;hame and a &s;candal to &s;end &s;uch raw boys into the world as &s;urgeons; that it was great pre&s;umption in me, and an affront upon the Engli&s;h, to pretend to

&mdash;The facetious member, encouraged by the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his la&s;t joke, went on thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Suppo&s;e you was called to a patient of a plethoric ha|bit, who had been brui&s;ed by a fall, what would you do?"</Q> I an&s;wered, I would bleed him immediately. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, (&s;aid he) before you tied up his arm?"&mdash;</Q>But this &s;troke of wit not an&s;wering his expectation, he de&s;ired me to advance to the gentleman who &s;at next him; and who with a pert air, a&s;ked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the inte&s;tines.&mdash;I repeated the method of cure as it is pre&s;cribed by the be&s;t chirurgical writers; which he heard to an end, and then &s;aid with a &s;upercilious &s;mile. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So, you think with &s;uch treatment the patient might recover?"&mdash;</Q>I told him I &s;aw nothing to make me think otherwi&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That may be (re&s;umed he) I won't an&s;wer for your fore&s;ight;&mdash;but did you ever know a ca&s;e of this kind &s;ucceed?"</Q> I acknowledged I did not; and was about to tell him I had never &s;een a wounded inte&s;tine; but he &s;topt me, by &s;aying with &s;ome precipitation, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor never will.&mdash;I affirm, that all wounds of the inte&s;tines, whether great or &s;mall, are mortal."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pardon me, bro|ther (&s;ays the fat gentleman) there is very good authority"&mdash;</Q>Here he was interrupted by the other, with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, excu&s;e me, I de&s;pi&s;e all authority.&mdash;<HI>Nullius in verba.</HI>&mdash;I &s;tand upon my own bottom."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But Sir, Sir, (replied his antagoni&s;t) the rea&s;on of the thing &s;hews"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A fig for rea&s;on (cried this &s;ufficient mem|ber) I laugh at rea&s;on, give me ocular de|mon&s;tration."&mdash;</Q>The corpulent gentleman be|gan to wax warm, and ob&s;erved that no man ac|quainted with the anatomy of the parts, would

In le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, I was called in again, and received my qualifica|tion &s;ealed up, and was ordered to pay five &s;hil|lings.&mdash;I laid down my half-guinea upon the table, and &s;tood &s;ome time, until one of them bid me begone; to this I replied, I will, when I have got my change; upon which another threw me five &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, &s;aying, I would not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was afterwards obliged to give three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence to the beadles, and a &s;hilling to an old woman who &s;wept the hall: This di&s;bur&s;ement &s;unk my finances to thirteen pence half-penny, with which I was &s;neaking off, when Jack&s;on perceiving it, came up to me, and begged I would tarry for him and he would ac|company me to the other end of the town, as &s;oon as his examination &s;hould be over. I could not refu&s;e this to a per&s;on that was &s;o much my friend; but I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the change of his dre&s;s, which was varied in half an hour from what I have already de&s;cribed, to a very grote&s;que fa&s;hion.&mdash;His head was covered with an old &s;moaked tye-wig that did not boa&s;t one crooked hair, and a &s;loutched hat over it, which would have very well become a chimney-&s;weeper or a du&s;t-man;&mdash;his neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which he had twi&s;ted, and

fixed in the button-hole of a &s;habby great coat that wrapped up his whole body; his white &s;ilk &s;tockings were converted into black wor&s;ted ho&s;e; and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a beard of his own painting.&mdash;When I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize at this metamor|pho&s;is, he laughed, and told me, it was done by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend who lived over the way, and would certainly produce &s;ome|thing very much to his advantage; for it gave him the appearance of age, which never fails of attracting re&s;pect. I applauded his &s;agacity, and waited with impatience, for the effects of it. At length he was called in, but whether the od|ne&s;s of his appearance excited a curio&s;ity more than u&s;ual in the board, or his behaviour was not &s;uitable to his figure, I know not, he was di&s;|covered to be an impo&s;tor, and put into the hands of the beadle, in order to be &s;ent to Bridewell. So that in&s;tead of &s;eeing him come out with a chearful countenance, and a &s;urgeon's qualifi|cation in his hand, I perceived him led through the outward hall as a pri&s;oner; and was very much alarmed and anxious to know the occa&s;ion; when he called with a lamentable voice and pite|ous a&s;pect, to me, and &s;ome others who knew him; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For God's &s;ake, gentlemen, bear wit|ne&s;s that I am the &s;ame individual John Jack|&s;on, who &s;erved as &s;urgeon's &s;econd mate on board the Elizabeth, or el&s;e I &s;hall go to Bride|well."&mdash;</Q>It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t au&s;tere hermit that ever lived, to have re|frained from laughing at his appearance and ad|dre&s;s; we therefore indulged our&s;elves a good while at his expence, and afterwards pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o effectually with the beadle, who was

gratified with half a crown, that the pri&s;oner was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and in a few moments re&s;umed his former gaiety;&mdash;&s;wearing, &s;ince the board had refu&s;ed his money, he would &s;pend it every &s;hil|ling before he went to bed in treating his friends; at the &s;ame time inviting us all to favour him with our company.&mdash;It was now ten o' clock at night, and as I had a great way to walk in a town where I was a &s;tranger, I was prevailed upon to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings, which he faithful|ly promi&s;ed.&mdash;He carried us to his friend's hou&s;e, who kept a tavern over the way, where we re|mained drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to our heads, and made us all extremely fro|lick&s;ome: I, in particular was &s;o much elevated, that nothing would &s;erve me but a wench, at which Jack&s;on expre&s;&s;ed much joy, and a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould have my de&s;ire before we parted.&mdash;Accordingly, when he had paid the reckon|ing we &s;allied out, roaring and &s;inging; and were conducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment, where I immediately attached my|&s;elf to a fair one, with whom I propo&s;ed to &s;pend the remaining part of the night; but &s;he not re|li&s;hing my appearance, refu&s;ed to grant my re|que&s;t before I had made her an acknowledgment, which not &s;uiting my circum&s;tances we broke off our corre&s;pondence, to my no &s;mall mortifi|cation and re&s;entment, becau&s;e I thought the mercenary creature had not done ju&s;tice to my merit.&mdash;In the mean time, Mr. Jack&s;on's dre&s;s had attracted the inclinations and a&s;&s;iduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded him with care&s;&s;es, in return for the arrack punch with which he treated them; till at length, notwith|&s;tanding

<PB N="149" REF="171">
at the &s;ame time burning with re&s;entment again&s;t his adver&s;ary, quitted his cloaths to the care of the multitude, and the battle began with great violence on the &s;ide of Strap, who in a few mi|nutes exhau&s;ted his breach and &s;pirits on his pa|tient antagoni&s;t, who &s;u&s;tained the a&s;&s;ault with great coolne&s;s, till finding the barber quite &s;pent, he returned the blows he had lent him, with &s;uch intere&s;t, that Strap, after having received three falls on the hard &s;tones, gave out, and allowed the black&s;mith to be the better man.&mdash;The victory being thus decided, it was propo&s;ed to adjourn to a cellar hard by and drink friends.&mdash;But when my friend began to gather up his cloaths, he per|ceived that &s;ome hone&s;t per&s;on or other had made free with his &s;hirt, neckcloath, hat and wig, which were carried off; and probably his coat and wai&s;tcoat would have met with the &s;ame fate, had they been worth the &s;tealing.&mdash;It was in vain for him to make a noi&s;e, which only yielded mirth to the &s;pectators; he was fain to get off in this manner, which he accompli&s;hed with much dif|ficulty, and appeared before me, all be&s;meared with blood and dirt.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding this mi&s;|fortune, &s;uch was his tran&s;port at finding me &s;afe and &s;ound, that he had almo&s;t &s;tifled and &s;tunk me to death with his embraces.&mdash;After he had cleaned him&s;elf and put on one of my &s;hirts, and a woolen night-cape in&s;tead of hat and wig; I recounted to him the particulars of my night's campaign, which filled him with admiration, and made him repeat with great energy an ob&s;er|vation which was often in his mouth, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"London is the devil's drawing room."&mdash;</Q>As neither of us had dined, he de&s;ired me to get up, and the milk-woman coming round at that in|&s;tant,

he went down &s;tairs and brought up a quart, with a penny brick, on which we made a com|fortable meal. He then &s;hared his money with me, which amounted to eighteen-pence, and left me, with an intention to borrow an old wig and hat of his friend the &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone, than I began to con|&s;ider my &s;ituation with great unea&s;ine&s;s, and revol|ved all the &s;chemes my imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, in order to chu&s;e and pur&s;ue &s;ome one that would procure me bread; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the pangs I felt, when I reflected on the mi&s;erable dependance in which I lived, at the expence of a poor barber's boy.&mdash;My pride took the alarm, and having no hopes of &s;ucceeding at the navy-office, I came to a re&s;olution of enli&s;ting in the foot guards next day, <HI>coute qui coute.</HI>&mdash;This ex|travagant de&s;ign, by flattering my di&s;po&s;ition, gave great &s;atisfaction, and I was charging the enemy at the head of my own regiment, when Strap's return interrupted my reverie.&mdash;The &s;chool-ma&s;ter had made him a pre&s;ent of the tye-wig which he wore when I was introduced to him, together with an old hat, who&s;e brims would have over&s;hadowed a Colo&s;&s;us.&mdash;Though Strap had ventured to wear them in the du&s;k, he did not chu&s;e to entertain the mob by day; there|fore went to work immediately and reduced them both to a moderate &s;ize.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The characters of Mr. Lavement, his wife and daughter&mdash;&s;ome anecdotes of the family&mdash;the mother and daughter rivals&mdash;I am guilty of a mi&s;take that gives me pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction, but is attended with trouble&s;ome con&s;equences.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEXT day, while I was at work in the &s;hop, a bouncing dam&s;el well dre&s;&s;ed came in, on pretence of finding a vial for &s;ome u&s;e or other; and taking an opportunity when &s;he thought I did not mind her, of ob&s;erving me nar|rowly, went away with a &s;ilent look of di&s;dain&mdash;I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed her &s;entiments, and my pride took the re&s;olution of entertaining the &s;ame indif|ference and neglect towards her&mdash;At dinner, the maids with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me to under&s;tand that this was my ma&s;ter's only daughter, who would have a very hand&s;ome for|tune, on account of which, and her beauty, a great many young gentlemen made their addre&s;&s;es to her&mdash;that &s;he had been twice on the brink of marriage, but di&s;appointed by the &s;tingine&s;s of her father, who refu&s;ed to part with a &s;hilling as long as he &s;hould live&mdash;for which rea&s;on the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial ve|neration that might be expected: In particular, &s;he harbour'd the mo&s;t perfect hatred for his coun|trymen, in which di&s;po&s;ition her mother join'd, who was an Engli&s;h woman; and by the hints
<PB N="156" REF="178">
they dropp'd, I learn'd the grey mare was the better hor&s;e&mdash;that &s;he was a matron of a high &s;pi|rit, which was often manife&s;ted at the expence of her dependants: That &s;he lov'd diver&s;ions; and look'd upon mi&s;s as her rival in all parties; which was indeed the true cau&s;e of her di&s;appoint|ments; for had the mother been hearty in her in|tere&s;t, the father would not have ventur'd to re|fu&s;e her demands.&mdash;Over and above this intelli|gence, I of my&s;elf, &s;oon made more di&s;coveries; Mr. Lavement's &s;ignificant grins at his wife, while &s;he look'd another way, convinc'd me that he was not at all content with his lot: And his behaviour in pre&s;ence of the captain, made me believe his chief torment was jealou&s;y.&mdash;As for my own part, I was con&s;ider'd in no other light than that of a menial &s;ervant, and had been already &s;ix days in the hou&s;e without being ho|nour'd with one word from either mother or daughter, the latter (as I under&s;tood from the maids) having at table one day, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize that her papa &s;hould entertain &s;uch an aukward, mean-looking journeyman.&mdash;I was net|tled at this piece of information, and next &s;unday, (it being my turn to take my diver&s;ion) dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in my new cloaths to the greate&s;t advantage, and, vanity apart, made no contemptible figure.&mdash;After having &s;pent mo&s;t part of the day in com|pany with Strap and &s;ome of his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by mi&s;s, who not knowing me, dropt a low cour|te&s;y as I advanced, which I returned with a pro|found bow, and &s;hut the door&mdash;By that time I had turn'd about, &s;he had perceiv'd her mi&s;take, and chang'd colour, but did not withdraw. The pa&s;|&s;age being narrow, I could not get away with|out
<PB N="157" REF="179">
jo&s;tling her; &s;o, I was forc'd to remain where I was, with my eyes fix'd on the ground, and my face glowing with blu&s;hes&mdash;At length her vanity coming to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he went away tittering, and I could hear her pronounce the word <Q REND="inline">"crea|ture:"</Q> From this day forward, &s;he came into the &s;hop fifty times every day, upon various pre|tences, and put in practice &s;o many ridiculous airs, that I could ea&s;ily perceive her opinion of me was chang'd, and that &s;he did not think me alto|gether an unworthy conque&s;t&mdash;But my heart was &s;o &s;teel'd again&s;t her charms by pride and re&s;ent|ment, which were two chief ingredients in my di&s;po&s;ition, that I remain'd in&s;en&s;ible to all her arts; and notwith&s;tanding &s;ome advances &s;he made, could not be prevail'd upon to yield her the lea&s;t attention&mdash;This neglect &s;oon bani&s;h'd all the favourable impre&s;&s;ions &s;he felt for me, and the rage of a &s;lighted woman took place in her heart; which &s;he manife&s;ted not only in all the &s;ugge&s;|tions her malice could invent to my prejudice with her father, but al&s;o in procuring for me &s;uch &s;ervile employments, as &s;he hoped, would &s;ufficiently humble my &s;pirit. One day in parti|cular, &s;he order'd me to bru&s;h my ma&s;ter's coat, but I refu&s;ing, a &s;mart dialogue en&s;ued, which ended in her bur&s;ting into tears of rage; when her mother interpo&s;ing, and examining into the merits of the cau&s;e, determin'd it in my favour; and this good office I ow'd not to any e&s;teem or con&s;ideration &s;he had for me, but &s;olely to the de|&s;ire or mortifying her daughter, who on this oc|ca&s;ion ob&s;erv'd, that let people be never &s;o much in the right, there were &s;ome folks who would never do them ju&s;tice; but to be &s;ure, they had their rea&s;on for it, which &s;ome people were not

ignorant of, although they de&s;pi&s;ed their little arts.&mdash;This in&s;inuation of &s;ome people and &s;ome folks, put me upon ob&s;erving the behavuiour of my mi&s;tre&s;s more narrowly for the future; and it was not long before I had rea&s;on to believe that &s;he look'd upon her daughter as a rival in the af|fections of captain Odonnell, who lodged in the hou&s;e.&mdash;In the mean time my indu&s;try and know|ledge gain'd me the good will of my ma&s;ter, who would often &s;ay in French, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Mardy! c'e&s;t un bon Gar&ccedil;on.</HI>"</Q> He had a great deal of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but as he was mo&s;tly employ'd among his fellow refugees, his profits were &s;mall.&mdash;However, his expence for medicines was not great, he be|ing the mo&s;t expert man at a &s;uccedaneum, of any apothecary in London, &s;o that I have been &s;ometimes amaz'd to &s;ee him without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, make up a phy&s;ician's pre&s;cription, though he had not in his &s;hop one medicine mention'd in it.&mdash;Oy&s;ter-&s;hells he could convert into crab's eyes; common oil into oil of &s;weet almonds; &s;yrup of &s;ugar into bal&s;amic &s;yrup; Thames water into aqua cinnamomi; turpentine into capivi; and a hundred more co&s;tly prepara|tions were produc'd in an in&s;tant, from the cheape&s;t and cour&s;e&s;t drugs of the <HI>materia medica:</HI> And when any common thing was order'd for a patient, he always took care to di&s;gui&s;e it in co|lour or ta&s;te, or both, in &s;uch a manner, as that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be known.&mdash;For which pur|po&s;e, cochineal and oil of cloves were of great &s;ervice among many no&s;trums which he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; there was one for the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, that brought him a good deal of money; and this he conceal'd &s;o artfully from me, that I could never learn its compo&s;ition: But during the eight months I &s;tay'd
<PB N="159" REF="181">
in his &s;ervice, he was &s;o unfortunate in the u&s;e of it, that three parts in four of tho&s;e who took it, were fain to confirm the cure with a &s;alivation under the direction of another doctor.&mdash;This bad &s;ucce&s;s, in all appearance, attach'd him the more to his &s;pecifick; and before I left him, I may venture to &s;ay, he would have &s;ooner renounc'd the Trinity (notwith&s;tanding his being a good Huegonot) than his confidence in the never-&s;ail|ing power of this remedy.&mdash;Mr. Lavement had attempted more than once, to introduce a vege|table diet into his family, by launching out into the prai&s;e of it, and decrying the u&s;e of fle&s;h, both as a Phy&s;ician and Philo&s;opher; but all his rheto|ric could not make one pro&s;elyte to his opinion, and even the wife of his bo&s;om declared again&s;t the propo&s;al.&mdash;Whether it was owing to the little re|gard &s;he paid to her hu&s;band's admonition in this particular, or to the natural warmth of her con|&s;titution, I know not; but this lady's pa&s;&s;ions be|came every day more and more violent, till at la&s;t &s;he look'd upon decency as an unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint; and one afternoon, when her hu&s;band was abroad, and her daughter vi&s;iting, order'd me to call a hackney coach, in which &s;he and the captain drove off towards Covent-Garden.&mdash;Mi&s;s came home in the evening, and &s;upping at her u&s;ual hour, went to bed.&mdash;About eleven a clock my ma&s;ter enter'd, and a&s;k'd if his wife was gone to &s;leep: Upon which I told him, my mi&s;tre&s;s went out in the afternoon, and was not yet re|turn'd.&mdash;This was like a clap of thunder to the poor Apothecary, who &s;tarting back, cried <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Mort de ma vie!</HI> vat you tell a me?&mdash;My wife not, at home!"&mdash;</Q>At that in&s;tant a patient's &s;er|vant arriv'd with a pre&s;cription for a draught,
<PB N="160" REF="182">
which my ma&s;ter taking, went into the &s;hop to make it up him&s;elf.&mdash;While he rubb'd the ingre|dients in a gla&s;s mortar, he enquir'd of me, whe|ther or no his wife went out alone; and no &s;ooner heard that &s;he was in company with the captain, than with one blow he &s;plit the mortar into a thou&s;and pieces, and grinning like the head of a ba&s;s viol, exclaim'd, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah traitre&s;&s;e!"&mdash;</Q>It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have pre|&s;erv'd my gravity a minute longer, when I was happily reliev'd by a rap at the door, which I open'd, and perceiv'd my mi&s;tre&s;s coming out of a coach; &s;he flounc'd immediately into the &s;hop, and addre&s;&s;ed her hu&s;band thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;uppo&s;e you thought I was lo&s;t, my dear&mdash;Captain Odonnell has been &s;o good as to treat me with a play."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Play&mdash;play (replied he) Oho! yes by gar, I believe ver prettie play."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me!

wife."&mdash;</Q>This declaration had &s;uch an effect on the apothecary, that he re&s;um'd all the polite&s;&s;e of a Frenchman; and with the ut|mo&s;t pro&s;tration of compliment, a&s;&s;ur'd the cap|tain that he was perfectly &s;atisfied with the honour he had done his wife.&mdash;Matters being thus com|pos'd, every body went to re&s;t.&mdash;Next day I perceiv'd thro' a gla&s;s door that open'd from the &s;hop into a parlour, the captain talking earne&s;tly to mi&s;s, who heard him with a look that expre&s;&s;ed anger mingled with &s;corn; which however he at la&s;t found means to mollify, and &s;eal'd his re|conciliation with a ki&s;s.&mdash;This &s;oon convinc'd me of the occa&s;ion of the quarrel; but notwith&s;tand|ing all my vigilance, I could never di&s;cover any other commerce between them.&mdash;In the mean while, I had rea&s;on to believe I had in&s;pir'd one of the maids with tender &s;entiments for me; and one night when I thought every other per&s;on in the hou&s;e a&s;leep, I took the opportunity of the other maid's ab&s;ence (for &s;he had got leave to go and vi&s;it her &s;ick father who liv'd at Richmond) to avail my&s;elf of my conque&s;t: Accordingly I got up, and (naked as I was) explor'd my way in the dark, to the garret where &s;he lay.&mdash;I was ra|vi&s;h'd to find the door open, and moved &s;oftly to her bed-&s;ide, tran&s;ported with the hope of com|pleating my wi&s;hes.&mdash;But what horrors of jea|lou&s;y and di&s;appointment did I feel, when I found her a&s;leep, fa&s;t locked in the arms of a man, whom I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed to be no other than the captain's &s;ervant! I was upon the point of doing &s;ome ra&s;h thing, when the noi&s;e of a rat &s;cratch|ing behind the wain&s;coat, put me to flight, and I was fain to get back to my own bed in &s;afety.&mdash;Whether this alarm had di&s;order'd my mind,
<PB N="162" REF="184">
or that I was led a&s;tray by the power of de&s;tiny, I know not; but in&s;tead of turning to the left when I de&s;cended to the &s;econd &s;tory, I per&s;u'd the contrary cour&s;e, and mi&s;took the young lady's bed-chamber for my own. I did not perceive my mi&s;take before I had run again&s;t the bed po&s;ts; and then it was not in my power to retreat undi&s;|cover'd: for the nymph being awake, felt my approach, and with a &s;oft voice, bid me make le&s;s noi&s;e le&s;t the Scotch-booby in the next room &s;hould over-hear us. This hint was &s;ufficient to inform me of the nature of the a&s;&s;ignation; and as my pa&s;&s;ions, at any time high, were then in a &s;tate of exaltation, I was re&s;olved to profit by my good fortune.&mdash;Without any more ceremony therefore, I made bold to &s;lip into bed to this char|mer, who gave me as favourable a reception as I could de&s;ire.&mdash;Our conver&s;ation was very &s;par|ing on my part, but &s;he upbraided the per&s;on whom I repre&s;ented, with his jealou&s;y of me, whom &s;he handled &s;o roughly, that my re&s;ent|ment had well nigh occa&s;ion'd a di&s;covery more than once; but I was con&s;oled for her hatred of me, by under&s;tanding from her own mouth, that it was now high time to &s;alve her reputation by matrimony; for &s;he had rea&s;on to fear &s;he could not much longer conceal the effects of their mu|tual intercour&s;e.&mdash;While I was meditating an an|&s;wer to this propo&s;al, I heard a noi&s;e in my room, like &s;omething heavy falling down upon the floor: Upon which, I &s;tarted up, and creeping to the door of my chamber, ob&s;erv'd by moon-light, the &s;hadow of a man groping his way out; where|upon, I retir'd to one &s;ide to let him pa&s;s, and &s;aw him go down &s;tairs as expeditiou&s;ly as he could.&mdash;It was an ea&s;y matter to divine that this
<PB N="163" REF="185">
was the captain, who having over-&s;lept him&s;elf, had got up at la&s;t to keep his a&s;&s;ignation; and finding my door open, had enter'd into my apartment in&s;tead of that of his mi&s;tre&s;s, where I &s;upplied his place.&mdash;But finding his mi&s;take, by falling over my chair, was afraid the noi&s;e might alarm the family, and for that rea&s;on made off, delay|ing the gratification of his de&s;ire till another op|portunity.&mdash;By this time, I was &s;atisfied; and in&s;tead of returning to the place from whence I came, retreated to my own ca&s;tle, which I for|tified by bolting the door; and in the congratula|tion of my own happine&s;s fell a&s;leep.&mdash;But the truth of this adventure could not be long conceal'd from my young mi&s;tre&s;s, who next day came to an eclairci&s;ement with the captain, upon his la|menting his la&s;t night's di&s;appointment, and beg|ging pardon for the noi&s;e he had made.&mdash;Their mutual chagrin, when they came to the know|ledge of what had happen'd, may be ea&s;ily con|jectur'd, though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other; for &s;he was con&s;cious of having not only betray'd to me the &s;ecrets of her com|merce with him; but al&s;o, of having incen&s;ed me by the freedoms &s;he had taken with my name, beyond a hope of reconciliation.&mdash;On the other hand, his jealou&s;y &s;ugge&s;ted, that her &s;orrow was all artifice; and that I had &s;upplied his place with her own privity and con&s;ent.&mdash;That &s;uch was the &s;ituation of their thoughts, will appear in the &s;equel&mdash;for that very day &s;he came into the &s;hop where I was alone, and fixing her eyes, &s;wimming in tears, upon me, &s;igh'd mo&s;t piteou&s;ly: But I was proof again&s;t her di&s;tre&s;s, by recollecting the epithets with which &s;he had honour'd me the night before; and believing that the good reception I en|joy'd
<PB N="164" REF="186">
was de&s;tin'd for another. I therefore took no notice of her affliction; and &s;he had the mor|tification to find her di&s;dain return'd four-fold.&mdash;However, from thenceforward &s;he thought pro|per to u&s;e me with more complai&s;ance than u&s;ual, knowing that it was in my power at any time to publi&s;h her &s;hame.&mdash;By the&s;e means my life became much more agreeable (though I never could prevail upon my&s;elf to repeat my nocturnal vi&s;it) and as I every day improv'd in my know|ledge of the town, I &s;hook off my aukward air by degrees, and acquir'd the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.</P>

<P>ONE night about twelve a clock, as I return'd from vi&s;iting a patient at Chel&s;ea, I receiv'd a blow on my head from an un&s;een hand, that &s;tretch'd me &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground; and was left for dead, with three &s;tabs of a &s;word in my body.&mdash;The groans I utter'd when I recover'd the u&s;e of my rea&s;on, alarm'd the people of a &s;olitary ale-hou&s;e, that &s;tood near the &s;pot where I lay, and they were humane enough to take me

in, and &s;end for a &s;urgeon who dre&s;&s;ed my wounds, and a&s;&s;ur'd me they were not mortal. One of them penetrated through the &s;kin and mu&s;cles of one &s;ide of my belly, in &s;uch a manner, that (doubtle&s;s) the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in imagin'd he had run me through the entrails.&mdash;The &s;econd &s;lanted along one of my ribs, and the la&s;t, which was intended for the <HI>Coup de Grace,</HI> being directed to my heart, the &s;word &s;napt upon my brea&s;t bone, and the point remain'd &s;ticking in the &s;kin.&mdash;When I re|flected upon this event, I could not per&s;uade my|&s;elf, that I had been a&s;&s;aulted by a common foot|pad; becau&s;e it is not u&s;ual for &s;uch people to murder tho&s;e they rob, e&s;pecially when they meet with no re&s;i&s;tance; and I found my money and every thing el&s;e about me (but my carca&s;e) &s;afe. I concluded therefore, that I mu&s;t either have been mi&s;taken for another, or oblig'd to the private re|&s;entment of &s;ome &s;ecret enemy for what had hap|pened; and as I could remember no-body who had the lea&s;t cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t me, ex|cept captain Odonnell and my ma&s;ter's daughter, my &s;u&s;picion &s;ettled upon them, though I took care to conceal it, that I might the &s;ooner ar|rive at confirmation.&mdash;With this view, I went home in a chair about ten a clock in the morning; and as the chairmen &s;upported me into the hou&s;e, met the captain in the pa&s;&s;age; who no &s;ooner &s;aw me, than he &s;tarted back, and gave evident &s;igns of guilty confu&s;ion, which he would have accounted for from the &s;urprize occa&s;ion'd by &s;eeing me in &s;uch a condition.&mdash;My ma&s;ter hav|ing heard my &s;tory, condoled me with a good deal of &s;ympathy, and when he under&s;tood my wounds were not dangerous, order'd me to be carried up &s;tairs to bed; though not without &s;ome

oppo&s;ition from his wife, who was of opinion, it would be better for me to go to an ho&s;pital, where I &s;hould be more carefully attended.&mdash;My medi|tation was employ'd in concerting with my&s;elf &s;ome method of revenge again&s;t 'Squire Odonnell and his enamorata, whom I looked upon as the authors of my misfortune; when mi&s;s (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber; and &s;aying, &s;he was &s;orry for the accident that had befallen me, a&s;ked me if I &s;u&s;pected any body to be the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: Upon which I fixed my eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly upon her, and an&s;wer'd, <Q REND="inline">"Yes."&mdash;</Q>She di&s;cover'd no &s;ymptom of confu&s;ion; but re|plied ha&s;tily, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If that be the ca&s;e, why don't you take out a warrant to have him appre|hended?&mdash;It will co&s;t but a trifle&mdash;if you have no money, I'll lend you."&mdash;</Q>This frankne&s;s not only cur'd me of my &s;u&s;picion with re&s;pect to her; but even &s;tagger'd my belief in regard to the captain, of who&s;e guilt I re&s;olv'd to have farther proofs, before I enterpriz'd any thing in the way of revenge.&mdash;I thanked her kindly for her generous offer; which however I had no oc|ca&s;ion to accept, being determin'd to do nothing ra&s;hly: For though I could plainly perceive the per&s;on who attacked me, to be a &s;oldier who&s;e face I thought was familiar to me, I could not &s;wear with a &s;afe con&s;cience to any particular man; and granting I could, my pro&s;ecution of him would not much avail.&mdash;This I pretended, le&s;t the captain hearing from her, that I knew the per&s;on who wounded me, might think pro|per to withdraw before I could be in a condition to requite him.&mdash;In two days I was up, and able to do a little bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that Mr. Lavement made &s;hift to carry on his practice, without hiring ano|ther

journeyman in my room.&mdash;The fir&s;t thing I attempted towards a certain di&s;covery of my &s;ecret enemy, was to get into Odonnell's apart|ment, while he was abroad in an undre&s;s, and examine his &s;word, the point of which being broke off, I applied the fragment that was found &s;ticking in my body; and found it an&s;wer'd the fractur'd part exactly.&mdash;There was now no room left for doubt; and all that remain'd, was to fix upon a &s;cheme of revenge, which almo&s;t &s;olely engro&s;&s;ed my thoughts during the &s;pace of eight nights and days.&mdash;Sometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the &s;ame manner as he had prac|ti&s;ed upon me, and kill him outright.&mdash;But this my honour oppos'd, as a piece of barbarous cow|ardice, in which he was not to be imitated.&mdash;At other times, I entertain'd thoughts of de|manding &s;atisfaction in an honourable way; but was diverted from this undertaking, by con&s;idering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature of the injury he had done me, which did not intitle him to &s;uch ea&s;y terms.&mdash;At la&s;t I determin'd to pur|&s;ue a middle cour&s;e; and actually put my de&s;ign in execution after this manner.&mdash;Having &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Strap and two of his acquaintance whom he could depend upon; we provided our|&s;elves in di&s;gui&s;es, and I cau&s;ed the following let|ter to be deliver'd to him by one of our a&s;&s;ociates in livery, one Sunday evening.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter was &s;igned with the name of [an apothecary's wife, who lived in Chel&s;ea, of whom I had heard Odonnell was an admirer.&mdash;Every thing &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;h.&mdash;The amor|ous hero ha&s;tened towards the place of a&s;&s;igna|nation; and was encountered by us in the very place where he had a&s;&s;aulted me.&mdash;We ru&s;hed upon him all at once, &s;ecured his &s;word, &s;tript off his cloaths even to the &s;kin, which we &s;courged with nettles till he was bli&s;tered from head to foot, notwith&s;tanding all the eloquence of his tears and &s;upplications. When I was &s;atisfied with the &s;tripes I had be&s;towed, we carried off his cloaths, which we hid in a hedge near the place, and left him &s;tark naked, to find his way home in the be&s;t manner he could, while I took care to be there before him.&mdash;I afterwards un|der&s;tood that in his way to the lodgings of a friend, who lived in the &s;kirts of the town, he was picked up by the watch, who carried him to the Round-hou&s;e, from whence he &s;ent for cloaths to his lodgings; and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapt up in a blanket he had borrowed; for his body was &s;o &s;ore and &s;welled that he could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparel.&mdash;He was treated with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s by my mi&s;tre&s;s and her daugh|ter,
<PB N="169" REF="191">
who vied one with the other in their care and attendance of him; but Lavement him&s;elf could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing his joy, by &s;everal malicious grins, while he ordered me to prepare an unguent to anoint him with.&mdash;As to my&s;elf, no body can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an opportunity of &s;eeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adver&s;ary, by the &s;ores and ulcers I had been the cau&s;e of; and indeed I not only enjoyed the &s;atisfaction of hav|ing flead him alive, but another al&s;o which I had not fore&s;een.&mdash;The &s;tory of his being attack|ed and &s;tript in &s;uch a place, having been in&s;erted in the news, gave information to tho&s;e who found his cloaths next day, whither to bring them; and accordingly he retrieved every thing he had lo&s;t, except a few letters, among which was that which I had wrote to him in the name of the apothecary's wife.&mdash;This and the others, which (it &s;eems) were all on the &s;ubject of love, (for this Hibernian hero was one of tho&s;e people who are called fortune-hunters) fell into the hands of a certain female author, famous for the &s;candal &s;he has publi&s;hed; who, after having em|belli&s;hed them with &s;ome ornaments of her own invention, gave them to the town in print.&mdash;I was very much &s;hocked on reflecting, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be the occa&s;ion of a whole family's unhappine&s;s, on account of the letter I had writ|ten; but was ea&s;ed of that apprehen&s;ion, when I under&s;tood that the Chel&s;ea apothecary had com|menced a law-&s;uit again&s;t the printer for defama|tion; and looked upon the whole as a piece of for|gery, committed by the author, who had di&s;ap|peared.&mdash;But whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two ladies &s;eemed to entertain a
<PB N="170" REF="192">
different idea of it; for, as &s;oon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive their care of their pa|tient con&s;iderably dimini&s;h, until at la&s;t it ended in total neglect.&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be ignorant of this change, any more than of the occa&s;ion of it; but as he was con&s;cious to him|&s;elf of having de&s;erved wor&s;e than contempt at their hands, he was glad to come off &s;o cheaply, and contented him&s;elf with muttering cur&s;es and threats again&s;t the apothecary, who (as he imagined) having got an inkling of the appoint|ment with his wife, had taken revenge of him in the manner de&s;cribed.&mdash;By that time he had got a new &s;carf &s;kin, his character was become &s;o notorious, that he thought it high time for him to decamp; which he performed one night with|out beat of drum, after having robbed his own &s;ervant of every thing that belonged to him ex|cept the cloaths he had on his back.&mdash;A few days after he di&s;appeared, Mr. Lavement, for his own &s;ecurity, took into cu&s;tody a large old trunk which he had left; and as it was very heavy, made no que&s;tion of the contents being &s;ufficient to indemnify him for what Odonnel owed in lodging.&mdash;But a month being elap&s;ed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer; and my ma&s;ter being impatient to know what the trunk contained; he ordered me to break it open in his pre&s;ence, which I performed with the pe&s;tle of our great mortar, and di&s;covered, to his inexpre&s;|&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment and mortification, a heap of &s;tones.</P>
<P>About this time, my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured me, that whatever advantage he
<PB N="171" REF="193">
might propo&s;e to him&s;elf from this pro&s;pect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me; &s;o much was he attached to my fortune.&mdash;In &s;pite of all the obligations I owed this poor hone&s;t fellow, ingratitude is &s;o natural to the heart of man, that I began to be tired of his ac|quaintance; and now, that I had contracted other friend&s;hips which appeared more creditable, I was even a&s;hamed to &s;ee a journey man barber enquiring after me with the familiarity of a com|panion.&mdash;I therefore, on pretence of con&s;ulting his welfare, in&s;i&s;ted upon his accepting the propo&s;al, which he at la&s;t determined to embrace, with great reluctance, and in a few days took his leave of me, &s;hedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold without emotion.&mdash;I now be|gan to look upon my&s;elf as a gentleman in reality; learned to dance of a Frenchman whom I had cured of a fa&s;hionable di&s;temper; frequented plays during the holidays; became the oracle of an ale-hou&s;e, where every di&s;pute was referred to my deci&s;ion; and at length contracted an acquain|tance with a young lady, who found means to make a conque&s;t of my heart, and upon whom I prevailed, after much attendance and &s;olicitation, to give me a promi&s;e of marriage.&mdash;As this beau|tiful creature pa&s;&s;ed for a rich heire&s;s, I ble&s;&s;ed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crowning all my wi&s;hes, by matrimony; when one morning, I went to her lodgings, and her maid being abroad, took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter her chamber, where to my utter confu&s;ion I found her in bed with a man.&mdash;Heaven gave me patience and pre&s;ence of mind enough to withdraw immediately; and I thanked my &s;tars a thou&s;and times for the happy

di&s;covery, by which I re&s;olved to profit &s;o much, as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE I enjoyed my&s;elf at large in this temper of mind, Mr. Lavement let his fir&s;t floor to my countryman and acquaintance 'Squire Gawky, who by this time had got a lieu|tenancy in the army, and &s;uch a martial ferocity in his appearance, that I was afraid he would re|member what had happened between us in Scot|land, and atone for his breach of appointment then, by his punctuality now; but whether he had actually forgot me, or was willing to make me believe &s;o, he betrayed not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of recognition at &s;ight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehen&s;ion; though I had occa|&s;ion not long after to be convinced, that how&s;o|ever his externals might be altered, he was at
<PB N="173" REF="195">
bottom the &s;ame individual Gawky whom I have already de&s;cribed.&mdash;For coming home late one night from the hou&s;e of a patient, I heard a noi&s;e in the &s;treet, and as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in cu&s;tody of three watchmen. The pri|&s;oners, who &s;eemed to be mi&s;erably disfigured with dirt, complained bitterly of the lo&s;s of their hats and wigs; and one of them, whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman, lamented mo&s;t pi|teou&s;ly, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman refu&s;ed, alledging that one of his companions was wounded grievou&s;ly, and that he mu&s;t &s;tand to the con&s;equence.&mdash;My prejudice in favour of my native country was &s;o &s;trong, that I could not bear to &s;ee any body belonging to it in di&s;tre&s;s, and therefore, with one blow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the per&s;on for whom I was chiefly concerned.&mdash;He no &s;ooner &s;ound him&s;elf di&s;engaged, than he betook him&s;elf to his heels, and left me to maintain the di&s;pute as I &s;hould think proper; and indeed I came off but &s;curvily, for before I could avail my&s;elf of my &s;peed, I received a blow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh deprived me of the u&s;e of that organ; however, I made &s;hift to get home, where I was informed of captain Gawky's being robb'd and abu&s;ed by a company of foot-pads; and was ordered by my ma&s;ter to prepare an emollient gly&s;ter and paregorick draught, in order to allay and compo&s;e the ferment of his &s;pirits, occa&s;ioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone, while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately.&mdash;When I enquired into the particulars of this adventure, and under|&s;tood by the &s;ervant, that he came in ju&s;t before

<P>MY father was an eminent merchant in the city, who having, in the cour&s;e of trade, &s;uf|fered very con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es, retired in his old age with his wife to a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, which he had purcha&s;ed with the remains of his fortune.&mdash;At that time I being but eight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of educa|tion; boarded with an aunt, who was a rigid Pre&s;byterian, and who confined me &s;o clo&s;ely to what &s;he called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of her doctrines, and by de|grees conceived an aver&s;ion for the good books &s;he daily recommended to my peru&s;al. As I in|crea&s;ed in age, and appeared with a per&s;on not di&s;agreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquain|tance among my own &s;ex; one of whom, after having lamented the re&s;traint I was under from the narrowne&s;s of my aunt's &s;entiments, told me, I mu&s;t now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example, and learn to think for my&s;elf;&mdash;for which purpo&s;e &s;he advi&s;ed me to read Locke, Shaft&s;bury, Tin|dal, Hobbs, and all the books that are remarka|ble for their deviation from the old way of think|ing, and by comparing one with another, I would &s;oon be able to form a &s;y&s;tem of my own.&mdash;I followed her advice, and whether it was ow|ing to my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t what I had for|merly

cried with &s;ome emotion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who the devil &s;hould it be, but the pri&s;oner Elizabeth Cary?"</Q> The turnkey replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Eli|zabeth Cary!&mdash;I'll be damned if that's Eliza|beth Cary, more than my grandmother.&mdash;D&mdash;n my blood, I know Bett Cary as well as if I had made her."&mdash;</Q>Here the lady thought fit to interpo&s;e, and tell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at fir&s;t, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf and her a great deal of trouble.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It may be &s;o (an&s;wered he) but by G&mdash;d, I'll have further evidence that you are not the per&s;on before you and I part."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, yes, (&s;aid &s;he) you &s;hall have further evidence to your co&s;t."&mdash;</Q>Upon this we adjourned into the lodge, and called for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to two of her acquaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings, and reque&s;t them to come to her immediately: I found them together at a hou&s;e in Bridges's &s;treet, Drury-lane, and as they were luckily unengaged, they &s;et out with me in a hack|ney-coach without he&s;itation, after I had related the circum&s;tances of the affair, which flattered them with hopes of &s;eeing a bailif trounced; for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailifs, as that &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between mice and cats.&mdash;Accordingly, when they entered the lodge, they embraced the pri&s;oner very affec|tionately by the name of Nancy Williams; and a&s;ked how long &s;he had been nabb'd, and for what?&mdash;On hearing the particulars of her adven|ture repeated, they offered to &s;wear before a ju&s;tice of peace that &s;he was not the per&s;on men|tioned in the writ whom it &s;eems, they all knew; but the bailif, who by this time was convinced of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, told them he would not

Whether it was owing to the want of oppo&s;ition, or to the weakne&s;s of nature, I know not, but on the &s;econd day of my fa&s;t, I found my re|&s;olution con&s;iderably impaired, and the calls of hunger almo&s;t in&s;upportable.&mdash;At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the pri&s;on, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio; &s;he was then on the &s;ame footing as I was, but afterwards quarreling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind, altered her &s;cheme of life, and &s;et up a coffee-hou&s;e among the hundreds of Drury, where &s;he entertained gentlemen with claret, ar|rack and the choice of half a dozen dam&s;els, who lived in her hou&s;e. This &s;erviceable ma|tron, having neglected to gratify a certain j&mdash;ce for the connivance &s;he enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions, in con&s;equence of which her bevy was di&s;per&s;ed and her&s;elf committed to Bridewell.&mdash;She had not been long there, before &s;he learned my di&s;a&s;ter, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolance, enquired into the particulars of my fate: While we were en|gaged in di&s;cour&s;e together, the ma&s;ter coming up, told me that the fellow on who&s;e account I had &s;uffered was taken, that he had confe&s;&s;ed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the af|fair; for which rea&s;on he, the ma&s;ter, had orders to di&s;charge me, and that I was from that mo|ment free. This piece of news &s;oon bani&s;hed all thoughts of death, and had &s;uch an in&s;tan|taneous effect on my countenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then pre&s;ent) hoping to find her account in me, very generou&s;ly offered to furni&s;h me with what nece&s;&s;aries I wanted, and take me into her own hou&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he could

Want of gallants was attended with want of money to &s;atisfy my malicious landlady, who having purpo&s;ely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ again&s;t me, and I was arre&s;ted in her own hou&s;e.&mdash;Though the room was crouded with people, when the bailif

At that in&s;tant a &s;ea lieutenant came in, and &s;eeing my plight, began to enquire into the circum&s;tances of my misfortune, when this wit advi&s;ed him to keep clear of me, for I was a fire-&s;hip.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A fire-&s;hip!

When he had applied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I a&s;ked him if my misfortunes had di&s;qui&s;ed me &s;o much, that he could not recollect my face?

what each received.&mdash;He therefore pre&s;ented my name to him, and de&s;ired I might be entered in his me&s;s; then taking a light in his hand, con|ducted me to the place of his re&s;idence, which was a &s;quare of about &s;ix feet, &s;urrounded with the medicine che&s;t, that of the fir&s;t mate, his own, and a board by way of table fa&s;tened to the mizen-ma&s;t it was al&s;o enclo&s;ed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the &s;hip, to &s;creen us from the cold, as well as the view of the mid|&s;hipmen and quarter-ma&s;ters, who lodged within the cable tiers on each &s;ide of us: In this gloomy man&s;ion, he entertained me with &s;ome cold &s;alt pork, which he brought from a &s;ort of locker, fixed above the table; and calling for the boy of the me&s;s, &s;ent him for a can of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet.&mdash;By this time I began to recover my &s;pirits, which had been exceedingly depre&s;&s;ed with the appear|ance of every thing about me, and could no longer refrain from a&s;king the particulars of Mr. Thom&s;on's fortune, &s;ince I had &s;een him in London.&mdash;He told me, that being di&s;appointed in his expectations of borrowing money to gra|tify the rapacious &s;&mdash;t&mdash;ry at the Navy-office, he found him&s;elf utterly unable to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer in town, and had actually offered his &s;er|vice, in quality of mate, to the &s;urgeon of a merchant's &s;hip bound to Guinea on the &s;laving trade; when one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had &s;ome acquaintance, came to his lodgings, and informed him, that he had &s;een a wa rant made out in his name at the Navy-office, for &s;urgeon's &s;econd mate of a third rate: This unexpected piece of good news he could &s;carcely believe to be true; more e&s;pecially, as he had
<PB N="228" REF="250">
been found qualified at Surgeon's-hall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to him&s;elf, he went thither to be a&s;&s;ured, and actually found it &s;o: Whereupon, demanding his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the oaths admini&s;tred immediately.&mdash;That very afternoon, he went to Grave&s;end in the tilt-boat, from whence he took a place in the tide-coach for Roche&s;ter; next morning got on board the Thunder, for which he was appointed, then ly|ing in the harbour at Chatham; and the &s;ame day was mu&s;tered by the clerk of the checque.&mdash;And well it was for him, that &s;uch expedi|tion was u&s;ed; for in le&s;s then twelve hours after his arrival, another William Thom&s;on came on board, affirming that he was the per&s;on for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impo&s;tor.&mdash;My friend was grievou&s;ly a|larmed at this accident; the more &s;o, as his name&s;ake had very much the advantage over him, both in a&s;&s;urance and dre&s;s.&mdash;However, to acquit him&s;elf of the &s;u&s;picion of impo&s;ture, he pro|duced &s;everal letters written from Scotland to him in that name, and recollecting that his indentures were in his box on board, he brought them up, and convinced all pre&s;ent, that he had not a&s;|&s;umed a name which did not belong to him.&mdash;His competitor enraged, that they &s;hould he&s;itate in doing him ju&s;tice (for to be &s;ure, the warrant had been de&s;igned for him) behaved with &s;o much indecent heat, that the commanding officer, (who was the &s;ame gentleman I had &s;een) and the &s;urgeon, were offended at his pre&s;umption, and making a point of it with their friends in town, in le&s;s than a week got the fir&s;t confirmed in his &s;tation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have been on board (&s;aid he) ever &s;ince, and as

a chri&s;tian!"</Q> Thom&s;on then gave him to under&s;tand, that as I had been brought on board half fami&s;hed, he could do no le&s;s than enter|tain me with what was in the locker; and the rather, as he had bid the &s;teward enter me in the me&s;s.&mdash;Whether this di&s;appointment made Mr. Morgan more peevi&s;h than u&s;ual, or he really thought him&s;elf too little regarded by his fellow|mate, I know not, but after &s;ome pau&s;e, he went on in this manner&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Thom&s;on, per|haps you do not u&s;e me with all the good manners, and complai&s;ance, and re&s;pect (look you) that becomes you, becau&s;e you have not vouch&s;afed to advi&s;e with me in this af|fair.&mdash;I have, in my time (look you) been a man of &s;ome weight, and &s;ub&s;tance, and con&s;ideration, and have kept hou&s;e and home, and paid &s;cot and lot, and the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot.&mdash;And moreover, al&s;o, I am your &s;enior, and your elder, and your petter, Mr. Thom&s;on."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My elder I'll allow you to be, but not my better (cried Thom&s;on, with &s;ome heat.)"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cot is my &s;aviour, and witne&s;s too (&s;aid Mor|gan, with great vehemence) that I am more elder, and therefore more petter by many years than you."&mdash;</Q>Fearing this di&s;pute might be at|tended with &s;ome bad con&s;equence, I interpo&s;ed, and told Mr. Morgan, I was very &s;orry for hav|ing been the occa&s;ion of any difference between him and the &s;econd mate; and that rather than cau&s;e the lea&s;t breach in their good under&s;tanding, I would eat my allowance by my&s;elf, or &s;eek ad|mi&s;&s;ion into &s;ome other company.&mdash;But Thom&s;on, with more &s;pirit than di&s;cretion (as I thought) in&s;i&s;ted upon my remaining where he had ap|pointed

me; and ob&s;erved that no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion, would have any objection to it, con&s;idering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late &s;o unju&s;tly undergone.&mdash;This was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who prote&s;ted with great earne&s;t|ne&s;s, that he had no objection to my being re|ceived in the me&s;s; but only complained, that the ceremony of a&s;king his con&s;ent was not ob|&s;erved. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for a &s;hentleman in di&s;tre&s;s (&s;aid he, &s;haking me by the hand) I lofe him as I lofe my own powels: For Got help me!

<PB N="233" REF="255">
Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linnen, he made me a pre&s;ent of two good ruffled &s;hirts, which with two of check Mr. Thom&s;on gave me, enabled me to appear with decency.&mdash;Mean while the &s;ailor, whom Mr. Morgan had &s;ent to the doctor, brought a pre|&s;cription for his me&s;s-mate, which when Mr. Welchman had read, he got up to prepare it, and a&s;ked if the man was "Tead or alive."&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dead!

<P>While he entertained us with reflections &s;uit|able to this event, we heard the boat&s;wain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging to our me&s;s, run to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden platter, and in a few minutes, returned with it full of boiled peas, crying, <Q REND="inline">"Scaldings,"</Q> all the way as he came.&mdash;The cloath, con&s;i&s;ting of a piece of an old &s;ail, was in&s;tantly laid, covered with three plates, which by the colour, I could with difficulty di&s;cern to be metal, and as many &s;poons of the &s;ame compo&s;i|tion, two of which were curtailed in the handles, and the other in the lip. Mr. Morgan him&s;elf enriched this me&s;s with a lump of &s;alt butter, &s;cooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions &s;horn, with &s;ome pounded pepper.&mdash;I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this di&s;h, of which, neverthele&s;s, my me&s;s-mates eat heartily, advi&s;ing me to follow their example, as it was banyan day, and we could have no meat till next noon.&mdash;But I had already laid in &s;ufficient for the occa&s;ion; and therefore de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed; expre&s;&s;ing a curio&s;ity to know the meaning of banyan day.&mdash;They tole me, that on Mondays, Wedne&s;days and Fridays, the &s;hip's com|pany had no allowance of meat, and that the&s;e meagre days were called banyan days, the rea&s;on of which they did not know; but I have &s;ince learned they take their denomination from a &s;ect of de|votees in &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t Indies, who ne|ver ta&s;te fle&s;h.</P>

<P>After having made an end of our mini&s;try for that time, we de&s;cended to the cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened, with a homely proverb, which I do not chu&s;e to repeat.&mdash;When we had got half way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he &s;aw us, having intelli|gence by his no&s;e, of the approach of &s;omething extraordinary, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cot have mercy upon my &s;en&s;es!

putter.&mdash;I gathered from this conver&s;ation, that if I went into the birth in my pre&s;ent pickle, I &s;hould be no welcome gue&s;t, and therefore de|&s;ired Mr. Thom&s;on to go before, and repre&s;ent my calamity; at which the fir&s;t mate expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way through the cable tire, and by the main hatchway, to avoid encountering with me; de&s;iring me to clean my&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for he intended to regale him&s;elf with a di&s;h of &s;almagundy and a pipe.&mdash;Accordingly, I &s;et about this di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;oon found I had more cau&s;es of complaint than I at fir&s;t imagined: For I perceived &s;ome gue&s;ts had honoured me with their company, who&s;e vi&s;it I did not at all think &s;ea&s;onable; neither did they &s;eem inclined to leave me in a hurry, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my chief quarters, where they fed without re&s;erve at the expence of my blood.&mdash;But con&s;idering it would be much ea&s;ier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their &s;ettlement, than after they &s;hould be multiplied and naturalized to the &s;oil, I took the advice of my friend, who, to prevent &s;uch misfortunes, went always clo&s;s &s;haved, and made the boy of our me&s;s cut off my hair, which had been growing &s;ince I le&s;t the &s;ervice of Lavement. The &s;econd mate lent me an old bob wig to &s;upply the lo&s;s of that covering. This affair being ended, and every thing ad|ju&s;ted in the be&s;t manner my circum&s;tances would permit, the de&s;cendant of Caractacus re|turned, and ordering the boy to bring a piece of &s;alt beef from the brine, cut off a &s;lice and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which &s;ea&s;oning with a moderate proportion of pepper and &s;alt, he brought it into a con&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="240" REF="262">
with oil and vinegar.&mdash;Then ta&s;ting the di&s;h, a&s;&s;ured us, it was the be&s;t &s;almagundie, that ever he made, and recommended it to our palate with &s;uch heartine&s;s, that I could not help doing ho|nour to his preparation. But I had no &s;ooner &s;wallowed a mouthful, than I thought my entrails were &s;corched, and endeavoured with a deluge of &s;mall beer, to allay the heat it occa&s;ioned.&mdash;Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having &s;moaked a couple of pipes, and &s;upplied the moi&s;ture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning began to ad|moni&s;h me, that it was high time to repair by &s;leep the injury I had &s;uffered from want of re&s;t the preceeding night; which being perceived by my companions, who&s;e time of repo&s;e was by this time arrived, they propo&s;ed we &s;hould turn in, or in other words, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another, on the out|&s;ide of our birth, were immediately unla&s;hed, and I beheld each of my me&s;s-mates &s;pring with great agility into his re&s;pective ne&s;t, where they &s;eemed to lie concealed, very much at their ea&s;e.&mdash;But it was &s;ome time before I could pre|vail upon my&s;elf to tru&s;t my carca&s;e at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which, I imagined, I &s;hould be apt, on the lea&s;t motion in my &s;leep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones. I &s;uffered my&s;elf, however, to be per&s;uaded, and taking a leap to get in, threw my&s;elf quite over, with &s;uch vio|lence, that had I not luckily got hold of Thom|&s;on's hammock, I &s;hould have pitched upon my head on the other &s;ide, and in all likelihood fractured my &s;cull.&mdash;After &s;ome fruitle&s;s efforts, I &s;ucceeded at la&s;t; but the apprehen&s;ion of the

jeopardy in which I believed my&s;elf, with&s;tood all the attacks of &s;leep, till towards the morning|watch, when in &s;pite of my fears, I was over-pow|ered with &s;lumber: tho' I did not long enjoy this comfortable &s;ituation; being arrou&s;ed with a noi&s;e &s;o loud and &s;hrill, that I thought the drums of my ears were bur&s;t by it; this was followed by a dreadful &s;ummons pronounced by a hoar&s;e voice, which I could not under&s;tand. While I was de|bating with my&s;elf whether or not I &s;hould wake my companion, and enquire into the occa&s;ion of this di&s;turbance, I was informed by one of the quarter-ma&s;ters, who pa&s;&s;ed by me with a lanthorn in his hand, that the noi&s;e which alarmed me, was occa&s;ioned by the boat&s;wain's mates who cal|led up the larboard watch, and that I mu&s;t lay my account with &s;uch interruption every morning at the &s;ame hour.&mdash;Being now more a&s;&s;ured of of my &s;afety, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf again to re&s;t, and &s;lept till eight a-clock, when getting up, and breakfa&s;ting with my comrades, on bi&s;cuit and brandy, the &s;ick were vi&s;ited and a&s;&s;i&s;ted as be|fore; after which my good friend Thom&s;on ex|plained and performed another piece of duty, to which I was a &s;tranger.&mdash;At a certain hour in the morning, the boy of the me&s;s went round all the decks, ringing a &s;mall hand-bell, and in rhimes compo&s;ed for the occa&s;ion, inviting all tho&s;e who had &s;ores to repair before the ma&s;t, where one of the doctor's mates attended, with applications to dre&s;s them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE I was bu&s;ied with my friend in this practice, the doctor chanced to pa&s;s by the place where we were, and &s;topping to ob|&s;erve me, appeared very well &s;atisfied with my method of application; and afterwards &s;ent for me to his cabbin, where, having examined me touching my &s;kill in &s;urgery, and the particulars of my fortune, intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o far in my be|half, as to promi&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring a warrant for me, &s;eeing I had been already found qualified at Surgeon's hall, for the &s;tation I now filled on board; and this he the more cordially engaged in, when he under&s;tood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowlin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> for whom he expre&s;&s;ed a
<PB N="243" REF="265">
particular regard.&mdash;In the mean time, I could learn from his di&s;cour&s;e, that he did not intend to go to &s;ea again with captain Oakhum, hav|ing, as he thought, been indifferently u&s;ed by him during the la&s;t voyage.</P>
<P>While I lived tollerably ea&s;y, in expectation of preferment, I was not altogether without morti|fications, which I not only &s;uffered from the rude in&s;ults of the &s;ailors, and petty officers, among whom I was known by the name of <HI>Loblolly Boy;</HI> but al&s;o from the di&s;po&s;ition of Morgan, who, though friendly in the main, was often very trouble&s;ome with his pride, which expected a good deal of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from me, and delighted in re|capitulating the favours I had received at his hands.</P>
<P>About &s;ix weeks after my arrival on board, the &s;urgeon bidding me follow him into his cabbin, pre&s;ented a warrant to me, by which I was ap|pointed &s;urgeon's third mate on board the Thun|der.&mdash;This he had procured by his intere&s;t at the Navy-office; as al&s;o another for him&s;elf, by vir|tue of which he was removed into a &s;econd rate. I acknowledged his kindne&s;s in the &s;tronge&s;t terms my gratitude could &s;ugge&s;t, and profe&s;&s;ed my &s;orrow at the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing &s;uch a valu|able friend, to whom I hoped to have recom|mended my&s;elf &s;till further, by my re&s;pectful and diligent behaviour.&mdash;But his genero&s;ity re&s;ted not here;&mdash;for, before he left the &s;hip, he made me a pre&s;ent of a che&s;t and &s;ome cloaths, that en|abled me to &s;upport the rank to which he had rai&s;ed me.&mdash;I found my &s;pirit revive with my good fortune; and now I was an officer, re&s;olved to maintain the dignity of my &s;tation, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition or affronts; nor was it long before I
<PB N="244" REF="266">
had occa&s;ion to exert my re&s;olution; my old ene|my the mid&s;hipman (who&s;e name was Crampley) entertaining an implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t me, for the di&s;grace he had &s;uffered on my account, had &s;ince that time taken all opportunities of re|viling and ridiculing me, when I was not intitled to retort his bad u&s;age.&mdash;And even after I had been rated on the books, and mu&s;tered as &s;urgeon's mate, did not think fit to re&s;train his in&s;olence.&mdash;In particular, being one day pre&s;ent, while I dre&s;&s;ed a wound in a &s;ailor's leg, he began to &s;ing a &s;ong, which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country, and therefore &s;ignified my re&s;entment, by ob&s;erving, that the Scots al|ways laid their account in finding enemies among the ignorant, in&s;ignificant and malicious.&mdash;This unexpected piece of a&s;&s;urance enraged him to &s;uch a degree, that he lent me a blow on the face, which I verily thought had demoli&s;hed my cheek|bone; I was not &s;low in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very &s;erious, when by ac|cident Mr. Morgan, and one of the ma&s;ter's mates, coming that way, interpo&s;ed, and inquiring into the cau&s;e, endeavoured to promote a reconciliation; but finding us both exa&s;perated to the uttermo&s;t, and bent again&s;t accommodation, they advi&s;ed us, either to leave our difference undecided till we &s;hould have an opportunity of terminating it on &s;hore, like gentlemen, or el&s;e chu&s;e a proper place on board, and bring it to an i&s;&s;ue by boxing. This la&s;t expedient was greedily embraced; and being forthwith conducted to the ground propo&s;ed, we &s;tript in a moment, and began a very furious conte&s;t, in which I &s;oon found my&s;elf inferior to my antagoni&s;t, not &s;o much in &s;trength and a|gility, as in &s;kill, which he had acquired in the
<PB N="245" REF="267">
&s;chool at Hockley in the Hole and Tottenham-Court.&mdash;Many cro&s;s-buttocks did I &s;u&s;tain, and pegs on the &s;tomach without number, till at la&s;t, my breath being quite gone, as well as my vigour wa&s;ted, I grew de&s;perate, and collecting all my &s;pirits in one effort, threw in at once head, hands, and feet with &s;uch violence, that I drove my antagoni&s;t three paces backward into the main hatch-way, down which he fell, and pitching upon his head and right &s;houlder, remained without &s;en&s;e and motion.&mdash;Morgan looking down, and &s;eeing him lie in that condition, cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon my con&s;cience, as I am a Chri&s;tian &s;inner (look you) I believe his pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witne&s;s that there was no treachery in the ca&s;e, and that he has &s;uffered by the chance of war."&mdash;</Q>So &s;aying, he de|&s;cended to the deck below, to examine into the &s;ituation of my adver&s;ary; and left me very little plea&s;ed with my victory, as I found my&s;elf not only terribly brui&s;ed, but likewi&s;e in danger of being called to account for the death of Cramp|ley: But this fear vani&s;hed when my fellow-mate, having by bleeding him in the juglar, brought him to him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of the &s;tate of his body, called up to me, to be under no con|cern, for the mid&s;hipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the <HI>os humeri,</HI> as one would de&s;ire to &s;ee on a &s;ummer's day.&mdash;Upon this information, I crawled down to the cockpit, and acquainted Thom&s;on with the affair, who, providing him&s;elf with bandages, &amp;c. ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the occa&s;ion, went up to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the di&s;location.&mdash;When this was &s;ucce&s;sfully performed, they wi&s;hed me joy of the event of the combat; and the
<PB N="246" REF="268">
Welchman, after ob&s;erving, that in all likelihood, the ancient Scots and Britons were the &s;ame peo|ple, bid me <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Prai&s;e Cot for putting mettle in my pelly, and &s;trength in my limbs to &s;upport it."&mdash;</Q>I acquired &s;uch reputation by this recounter (which la&s;ted twenty minutes) that every body became more cautious of his behaviour towards me; though Crampley with his arm in a &s;ling, talked very high, and threatened to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of retrieving on &s;hore, the honour he had lo&s;t by an accident, from which I could ju&s;tly claim no merit.</P>
<P>About this time, captain Oakhum, having re|ceived &s;ailing orders, came on board, and brought along with him a &s;urgeon of his own country, who &s;oon made us &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s we &s;uffered in the departure of doctor Atkins; being gro&s;sly ignorant, and intolerably a&s;&s;uming, fal&s;e, vindic|tive, and unforgiving; a mercile&s;s tyrant to his inferiors, an abject &s;ycophant to tho&s;e above him. In the morning after the captain came on board, our fir&s;t mate, according to cu&s;tom, went to wait on him with a &s;ick li&s;t, which when this grim commander had peru&s;ed, he cried with a &s;tern countenance, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Blood and oons! &s;ixty-one &s;ick people on board of my &s;hip!&mdash;Harkee you, &s;ir, I'll have no &s;ick in my &s;hip, by G&mdash;d."</Q> The Welchman replied, he &s;hould be very glad to find no &s;ick people on board; but while it was otherwi&s;e, he did no more than his duty in pre&s;enting him with a li&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You and your li&s;t may be d&mdash;n'd, (&s;aid the captain, throwing it at him) I &s;ay, there &s;hall be no &s;ick in this &s;hip while I have the command of her."&mdash;</Q>Mr. Morgan being nettled at this treatment, told him, his indignation ought to be directed
<PB N="247" REF="269">
to Got Almighty, who vi&s;ited his people with di&s;tempers, and not to him, who contributed all in his power towards their cure. The Ba&s;haw not being u&s;ed to &s;uch behaviour in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at this &s;atirical in|&s;inuation, and &s;tamping with his foot, called him in&s;olent &s;coundrel, threatning to have him pi|nioned to the deck, if he &s;hould pre&s;ume to ut|ter another &s;yllable. But the blood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated, di&s;dained to be re&s;tricted by &s;uch a command, and began to manife&s;t it&s;elf in, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Captain Oakoum, I am a &s;hentleman of birth and parentage (look you) and peradven|ture, I am moreover&mdash;."</Q> Here his har|rangue was broke off by the captain's &s;teward, who being Morgan's countryman, hurried him out of the cabbin before he had time to exa&s;perate his ma&s;ter to a greater degree, which would certainly have been the ca&s;e; for the in|dignant Welchman, could hardly be hindered by his friend's arguments and intreaties, from re|entering the pre&s;ence chamber, and defying cap|tain Oakhum to his teeth.&mdash;He was, however, ap|pea&s;ed at length, and came down to the birth, where finding Thom&s;on and me at work prepar|ing medicines, he bid us leave off our lapour and go to play, for the captain, by his &s;ole word and power and command, had driven &s;ickne&s;s a pegging to the tevil, and there was no more ma|lady on poard. So &s;aying, he drank off a gill of brandy, &s;ighed grievou&s;ly three times, poured forth an ejaculation of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Got ple&s;s my heart, liver, and lungs!"</Q> and then began to &s;ing a Welch &s;ong with great earne&s;tne&s;s of vi&s;age, voice and ge&s;ture.&mdash;I could not conceive the meaning of this &s;ingular phaenomenon, and &s;aw by the looks of Thom&s;on, who at the &s;ame time, &s;hook his head, that he
<PB N="248" REF="270">
&s;u&s;pected poor Cadwallader's brains were un&s;ettled. He perceiving our amazement, told us, he would explain the my&s;tery; but at the &s;ame time, bid us take notice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man and widower, almo&s;t forty years, and in all that time, there was no man nor mo|ther's &s;on in the whole world, who dur&s;t u&s;e him &s;o ill as captain Oakhum had done. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them, as I have already related it; and had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed this narration, than he re|ceived a me&s;&s;age from the &s;urgeon, to bring the &s;ick-li&s;t to the quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed.&mdash;This inhuman order &s;hocked us extreme|ly, as we knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry &s;ome of them on the deck, without immi|nent danger of their lives; but as we likewi&s;e knew it would be to no purpo&s;e for us to remon|&s;trate again&s;t it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a body, to &s;ee this extraordinary mu&s;ter; Morgan ob&s;erving by the way, that the captain was going to &s;end to the other world, a great many evidences to te&s;tify again&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;When we appeared upon deck, the captain bid the doctor, who &s;tood bowing at his right hand, look at the&s;e lazy, lubberly &s;ons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board, but to eat the king's pro|vi&s;ion, and encourage idlene&s;s in the &s;kulkers.&mdash;The &s;urgeon grinned approbation, and taking the li&s;t, began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed.&mdash;The fir&s;t who came under his cognizance, was a poor fellow ju&s;t freed of a fever, which had weakened him &s;o much, that he could hardly &s;tand.&mdash;Mr. Mack&s;hane (for that was the doctor's name)

having felt his pul&s;e, prote&s;ted he was as well as any man in the world; and the captain delivered him over to the boat&s;wain's mate, with orders that he &s;hould receive a round dozen at the gang|way immediately, for counterfeiting him&s;elf &s;ick when he was not;&mdash;but before the di&s;cipline could be executed, the man dropt down on the deck, and had well nigh peri&s;hed under the hands of the executioner.&mdash;The next patient to be con&s;idered, laboured under a quartan ague, and being then, in his interval of health, di&s;covered no other &s;ymptoms of di&s;temper, than a pale meagre countenance, and emaciated body; upon which, he was declared fit for duty, and turned over to the boat&s;wain;&mdash;but being re&s;olved to di&s;|grace the doctor, died upon the foreca&s;tle next day, during his cold fit.&mdash;The third complained of a pleuretic &s;titch, and &s;pitting of blood, for which doctor Mack&s;hane pre&s;cribed exerci&s;e at the pump to promote expectoration; but whether this was improper for one in his &s;ituation, or that it was u&s;ed to exce&s;s, I know not, but in le&s;s than half an hour, he was &s;uffocated with a de|luge of blood that i&s;&s;ued from his lungs.&mdash;A fourth, with much difficulty climbed to the quar|ter-deck, being loaded with a mon&s;trous a&s;cites or drop&s;y, that invaded his che&s;t &s;o much, he could &s;carce fetch his breath; but his di&s;ea&s;e be|ing interpreted into fat, occa&s;ioned by idlene&s;s and exce&s;s of eating, he was ordered, with a view to promote per&s;piration and enlarge his che&s;t, to go aloft immediately: It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch, to alledge his utter incapacity, the boat&s;wain's driver was commanded to whip him up with a cat and nine tails: The &s;mart of this application made him exert him&s;elf &s;o much, that

he actually arrived at the foot-hook-&s;hrouds, but when the enormous weight of his body had no|thing el&s;e to &s;upport it than his weakened arms, either out of &s;pite or nece&s;&s;ity, he quitted his hold, and plumped into the &s;ea, where he mu&s;t have been drowned, had not a &s;ailor who was in a boat along-&s;ide, &s;aved his life, by keeping him a|float, till he was hoi&s;ted on board by a tackle&mdash;It would be tedious and di&s;agreeable to de&s;cribe the fate of every mi&s;erable object that &s;uffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the captain and &s;urgeon, who &s;o wantonly &s;acrificed the lives of their fellow-creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and rendered delirious by the injuries they &s;uffered in the way.&mdash;Some gave up the gho&s;t in the pre&s;ence of their in&s;pec|tors; and others, who were ordered to their du|ty, langui&s;hed a few days at work, among their fellows, and then departed without any ceremony.&mdash;On the whole, the number of &s;ick was reduced to le&s;s than a dozen; and the authors of this re|duction were applauding them&s;elves for the &s;er|vice they had done to their king and country, when the boat&s;wain's mate informed his honour, that there was a man below la&s;hed to his ham|mock by the direction of the doctor's mate, and that he begged hard to be relea&s;ed; affirming, he had been &s;o maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore to him, and that he was as much in his &s;en&s;es as any man aboard.&mdash;The captain hearing this, darted a &s;evere look at the Welchman, and ordered the man to be brought up immediately: Upon which, Morgan prote&s;ted with great fervency, that the per&s;on in que&s;tion was as mad as a March-hare; and begged for the the love of Got, they would at lea&s;t keep his

arms pinioned during his examination, to prevent him from doing mi&s;chief.&mdash;This reque&s;t the com|mander granted for his own &s;ake, and the patient was produced, who in&s;i&s;ted upon his being in his right wits with &s;uch calmne&s;s and &s;trength of ar|gument, that every body pre&s;ent was inclined to believe him, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no tru&s;ting to appearances; for he him&s;elf had been &s;o much impo&s;ed upon by his behaviour two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters, who declared, he had pulled this patient from the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down and almo&s;t &s;trangled.&mdash;To this the man an&s;wered, that the witne&s;s was a creature of Morgan's, and was &s;uborned to give his te&s;timony again&s;t him by the malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by di&s;covering to the people on board, that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin-&s;hop in Rag-Fair.&mdash;This anecdote produced a laugh at the expence of the Welchman, who &s;haking his head with &s;ome emotion, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, ay, 'tis no matter.&mdash;Got knows, 'tis an arrant fal&s;hood."&mdash;</Q>Captain Oakhum, without any further he&s;itation, ordered the fellow to be unfettered; at the &s;ame time, threatening to make Morgan exchange &s;ituations with him for his &s;pite; but the Briton no &s;ooner heard the deci&s;ion in favour of the madman, than he got up the mizzen-&s;hrouds, crying to Thom|&s;on and me to get out of his reach, for we &s;hould &s;ee him play the tevil with a vengeance.

have &s;atisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the fir&s;t lieutenant remon&s;trated again&s;t it, by ob&s;erving that in all appearance, the fel|low was not mad but de&s;perate; that he had been hired by &s;ome enemy of the captain to a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate him, and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no doubt, would &s;ift the affair to the bot|tom, by which, important di&s;coveries might be made, and then &s;entence the criminal to a death adequate to his demerits.&mdash;This &s;ugge&s;tion, im|probable as it was, had the de&s;ired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the me|ridian of his intellects; more e&s;pecially, as doc|tor Mack&s;hane e&s;pou&s;ed this opinion, in con&s;e|quence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad.&mdash;Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not help di&s;covering by his countenance, the plea&s;ure he enjoyed on this occa&s;ion; and while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation, ventured to a&s;k him, Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board? But he would have been wi&s;er in containing this &s;ally, which his patient careful|ly laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a more fit &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;Mean while we weighed anchor, and on our way to the Downs, the mad|man, who was treated as a pri&s;oner, took an op|portunity, while the centinel attended him at the head, to leap over-board, and fru&s;trate the revenge of the captain.&mdash;We &s;taid not long at the downs, but took the benefit of the fir&s;t ea&s;terly wind to go round to Spithead; where having re|ceived on board provi&s;ions for &s;ix months, we &s;ailed from St. Helens, in the grand fleet bound

effects of the &s;torm? The &s;ea was &s;welled into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our &s;hip &s;ometimes hung, as if it was about to be precipitated to the aby&s;s below! Sometimes we &s;unk between two waves that ro&s;e on each &s;ide higher than our topma&s;t head, and threatned by da&s;hing together, to overwhelm us in a mo|ment! Of all our fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and fifty &s;ail, &s;carce twelve appeared, and the&s;e driving under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tem|pe&s;t. At length the ma&s;ts of one of them gave way, and tumbled over-board with a hideous cra&s;h! Nor was the pro&s;pect in our own &s;hip much more agreeable;&mdash;a number of officers and &s;ailors run backward and forward with di&s;traction in their looks, hollowing to one another, and unknowing what they &s;hould attend to fir&s;t. Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend the &s;ails that were &s;plit into a thou&s;and pieces flapping in the wind; others tried to furl tho&s;e which were yet whole, while the ma&s;ts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they would have &s;hivered into innumerable &s;plinters!&mdash;While I con&s;idered this &s;cene with equal ter|ror and a&s;toni&s;hment, one of the main-braces broke, by the &s;hock whereof two &s;ailors were flung from the yard's arm into the &s;ea, where they peri&s;hed, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck, at the expence of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and found a &s;plinter of the &s;hin-bone thru&s;t by the violence of the fall through the &s;kin: As this was a ca&s;e of too great con&s;equence to be treated without the authority of the doctor, I went down to his cabin, to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up dre&s;&s;ings, which
<PB N="256" REF="278">
we always kept ready prepared.&mdash;I entered his apartment without any ceremony, and by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees, before &s;omething that very much re&s;embled a crucifix; but this I will not in&s;i&s;t upon, that I may not &s;eem too much a &s;lave to common re|port, which indeed a&s;&s;i&s;ted my conjecture on this occa&s;ion, by repre&s;enting doctor Mack&s;hane as a member of the church of Rome.&mdash;Be this as it will, he got up in a &s;ort of confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned (I &s;uppo&s;e) by his being di&s;turbed in his devotion, and in a trice, &s;natched the object of my &s;u&s;picion from my &s;ight.&mdash;After making an apology for my intru&s;ion, I acquainted him with the &s;ituation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to vi&s;it him on deck where he lay; he bid me de&s;ire the boat&s;wain to order &s;ome of the men to carry him down to the cockpit, and in the mean time he would direct Thom&s;on in getting ready the dre&s;&s;ings.&mdash;When I &s;ignified to the boat&s;wain the doctor's de&s;ire, he &s;wore a terrible oath, that he could not &s;pare one man from the deck, becau&s;e he expected the ma&s;ts would go by the board every minute.&mdash;This piece of infor|mation did not at all contribute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Morgan, I &s;upported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Mack&s;hane, after much intreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thom&s;on with a boxful of dre&s;&s;ings, and his own &s;ervant, who carried a whole &s;et of capital in&s;truments.&mdash;He examined the fracture and the wound, and concluding from a livid colour extending it&s;elf upon the limb, that a mortification would en&s;ue, re&s;olved to amputate the leg immediately.&mdash;This was a dreadful &s;en|tence

Morgan, who had a

unattempted towards the completion of his ven|geance again&s;t the Welchman and me. He went among the &s;ick under pretence of enquiring into their grievances, with a view of picking up complaints to our prejudice; but finding him&s;elf fru&s;trated in that expectation, by the good-will we had procured from the patients by our dili|gence and humanity, he took the re&s;olution of li&s;tening to our conver&s;ation, by hiding him&s;elf behind the canvas that &s;urrounded our birth; here too he was detected by the boy of our me&s;s, who acquainted us with this piece of behaviour, and one night, while we were picking a large bone of &s;alt-beef, Morgan di&s;cerned &s;omething &s;tir again&s;t our hangings, which immediately in|terpreting to be the doctor, he tipt me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I could evident|ly perceive &s;ome body &s;tanding; upon which, I &s;natched up the bone, and levelled it with all my force at him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever you are, take that for your curio&s;ity."&mdash;</Q>It had the de&s;ired effect, for we heard the li&s;tener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabbin.&mdash;I ap|plauded my&s;elf much for this feat, which turned out one of the mo&s;t unlucky exploits of my life, Mack&s;hane from that night marking me out for de&s;truction.&mdash;About a week thereafter, as I was going my rounds among the &s;ick, I was taken pri|&s;oner, and carried to the poop by the ma&s;ter at arms, where I was loaded with irons, and &s;tapled to the deck, on pretence that I was a &s;py on board, and had con&s;pired again&s;t the captain's life.&mdash;How ridiculous &s;oever this imputation was, I did not fail to &s;uffer by it all the rigour that could be &s;hewn to the wor&s;t of criminals, being expo&s;ed in this mi&s;erable condition to the &s;corch|ing

heat of the &s;un by day, and the unwhole&s;ome damps by night, during the &s;pace of twelve days, in which time I was neither brought to trial, nor examined touching the probability of my charge.&mdash;I had no &s;ooner recovered the u&s;e of my reflec|tion, which had been quite overthrown by this accident, than I &s;ent for Thom&s;on, who, after condoling with me on the occa&s;ion, hinted to me, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the doctor, who had given in an information again&s;t me to the captain, in con&s;equence of which I was arre&s;ted, and all my papers &s;eized.&mdash;While I was cur&s;ing my capricious fate, I &s;aw Morgan a&s;cend the poop, guarded by two corporals, who made him &s;it down by me, that he might be pinioned in the &s;ame machine.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding my &s;i|tuation, I could &s;carce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow pri&s;oner, who, without &s;peaking one word, allowed his &s;eet to be inclo&s;ed in the rings provided for that purpo&s;e; but when they pretended to fa&s;ten him on his back, he grew outragious, and drawing a large cuteau from his &s;ide-pocket, threatened to rip up the belly of the fir&s;t man who &s;hould approach him, in order to treat him in &s;uch an unworthy manner.&mdash;They were preparing to u&s;e him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the quarter|deck, called up to them to let him remain as he was.&mdash;He then crept towards me, and taking me by the hand, bid me <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"put my tru&s;t in Got."&mdash;</Q>And looking at Thom&s;on, who &s;at by us trembling, with a pale vi&s;age, told him, there were two more rings for his feet, and he &s;hould be glad to find him in &s;uch good company.&mdash;But it was not the intention of our adver&s;ary to include the &s;econd mate in our fate: Him he ex|cepted

<P>While I and my fellow-pri&s;oner comforted each other in our tribulation, the admiral di&s;|covered four &s;ail of &s;hips to leeward, and made &s;ignal for our &s;hip and four more to chace: Here|upon, every thing was cleared for an engagement, and Mack&s;hane fore&s;eeing he would have occa|&s;ion for more a&s;&s;i&s;tants than one, obtained Mor|gan's liberty; while I was left in this deplorable po&s;ture to the chance of battle.&mdash;It was almo&s;t dark when we came up with the &s;ternmo&s;t chace, which we hailed, and enquired who they were; they gave us to under&s;tand they were French men of war, upon which captain Oakhum com|manded them to &s;end their boat on board of him; but they refu&s;ed, telling him, if he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with them, to come on board of their &s;hip: He then threatned to pour in a broad-&s;ide upon them, which they promi&s;ed to return.&mdash;Both &s;ides were as good as their word, and the engagement began with great fury.&mdash;The reader may gue&s;s how I pa&s;&s;ed my time, lying in this helple&s;s &s;ituation, amid&s;t the terrors of a &s;ea-fight; expecting every moment to be cut a&s;under or da&s;hed in pieces by the enemy's &s;hot! I en|deavoured to compo&s;e my&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more expo&s;ed than tho&s;e who were &s;tationed about me; but when I beheld them employed without inter|mi&s;&s;ion, in annoying the foe, and encouraged by the &s;ociety and behaviour of one another, I

could ea&s;ily perceive a wide difference between their condition and mine: However, I concealed my agitation as well as I could, till the head of the officer of Marines, who &s;tood near me, be|ing &s;hot off, bounced from the deck athwart my face, leaving me well-nigh blinded with brains.&mdash;I could contain my&s;elf no longer, but began to bellow with all the &s;trength of my lungs; when a drummer coming towards me, a&s;ked if I was wounded; and before I could an&s;wer, re|ceived a great &s;hot in his belly which tore out his intrails, and he fell flat on my brea&s;t.&mdash;This acci|dent entirely bereft me of all di&s;cretion: I re|doubled my cries, which were drowned in the noi&s;e of the battle; and finding my&s;elf di&s;regard|ed, lo&s;t all patience and became frantick; vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my &s;pirits being quite exhau&s;ted, I remained quiet and in|&s;en&s;ible of the load that oppre&s;&s;ed me.&mdash;The en|gagement la&s;ted till broad day, when captain Oakhum, finding he was like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair, pretended to be undeceived by &s;eeing their colours; and hail|ing the &s;hip with whom he had fought all night, prote&s;ted he believed them Spaniards, and the guns being &s;ilenced on each &s;ide, ordered the barge to be hoi&s;ted out, and went on board of the French commodore.&mdash;Our lo&s;s amounted to ten killed and eighteen wounded, mo&s;t part of whom afterwards died.&mdash;My fellow-mates had no &s;ooner di&s;patched their bu&s;ine&s;s in the cockpit, than full of friendly concern, they came to vi&s;it me.&mdash;Morgan a&s;cending fir&s;t, and &s;eeing my face almo&s;t covered with brains and blood, con|cluded I was no longer a man for this world; and calling to Thom&s;on with great emotion, bid him

to u&s;e &s;ini&s;ter means to accompli&s;h his de&s;truction. That the death of Thom&s;on &s;eemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the &s;tings of remor&s;e, for being engaged in &s;uch a horrid con|federacy, or fearing a di&s;covery, by which he mu&s;t have infallibly &s;uffered an ignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own exi&s;tence.&mdash;But what e&s;tabli&s;hed the truth of the whole, was a book in cypher found among my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his che&s;t, after his di&s;|appearance: This, he ob&s;erved, was a pre&s;ump|tion very near proof po&s;itive, and would deter|mine any jury in chri&s;tendom to find me guilty.&mdash;In my own defence, I alledged that I had been dragged on board at fir&s;t very much again&s;t my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of &s;ome people now in the &s;hip; con&s;equently could have no de&s;ign of becoming &s;py at that time; and ever &s;ince had been entirely out of the reach of any corre&s;pondence that could ju&s;tly intail that &s;u&s;picion upon me;&mdash;and as for con&s;piring a|gain&s;t my captain's life, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that any man in his right wits would harbour the lea&s;t thought of &s;uch an undertaking, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly perform without certain infamy and ruin to him&s;elf, even if he had all the incli|nation in the world.&mdash;That allowing the boy's evidence to be true (which I affirmed was fal&s;e and malicious) nothing conclu&s;ive could be gathered from a few incoherent words: Neither was the fate of Mr. Thom&s;on a circum&s;tance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket, a letter which too well explained that my&s;tery, in a very different manner from that which was &s;up|po&s;ed: With the&s;e words I produced the follow|ing letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the

<P>This letter was no &s;ooner read, than Mack|&s;hane, in a tran&s;port of rage, &s;natched it out of the clerk's hands, and tore it into a thou&s;and pieces, &s;aying, it was a villainous forgery, con|trived and executed by my&s;elf.&mdash;The captain and clerk declared them&s;elves of the &s;ame opinion,
<PB N="274" REF="296">
notwith&s;tanding I in&s;i&s;ted on having the remains of it compared to other writings of Thom&s;on, which they had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I was ordered to an&s;wer the la&s;t article of my accu&s;ation, name|ly, the book of cyphers found among my papers.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That is ea&s;ily done (&s;aid I.)

The captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal-book into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he could neither read nor write; the other acknowledged the &s;ame degree of ignorance, but pretended to &s;peak the Greek lingo with any man on board; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, pronounced &s;ome &s;entences of a barbarous corrupted language, which I did not under&s;tand.&mdash;I a&s;&s;erted that the modern Greek was as different from that &s;poke and written by the ancients, as the Engli&s;h u&s;ed now from the old Saxon &s;poke in the time of Hengi&s;t; and as I had only learned the true original tongue, in

which Homer, Pindar, the evangeli&s;ts and other Great men of antiquity wrote, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that I &s;hould know any thing of an imperfect Gothic dialect that ro&s;e on the ruins of the former, and &s;carce retained any traces of the old expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But if doctor Mack&s;hane, who pretended to be ma&s;ter of the Greek language, could maintain a conver&s;ation with the&s;e &s;eamen, I would retract what I had &s;aid, and be content to &s;uffer any puni&s;hment he &s;hould think proper to inflict.&mdash;I had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e words, than the &s;urgeon knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman, acco&s;ted him in Iri&s;h, and was an&s;wered in the &s;ame brogue; then a dialogue en&s;ued between them, which they affirmed to be Greek, after having &s;ecured the &s;e|crecy of the other tar, who had his cue in the language of the Morea from his companion, be|fore they would venture to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch an intrepid fal&s;hood.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I thought (&s;aid Oakhum) we &s;hould di&s;cover the impo&s;ture at la&s;t,&mdash;Let the ra&s;cal be carried back to his confinement.&mdash;I find he mu&s;t dangle."&mdash;</Q>Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf, before a court &s;o preju|diced with &s;pite, and fortified with ignorance again&s;t truth, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be recon|ducted peaceably to my fellow-pri&s;oner, who hearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven, and uttered a dreadful groan; and not daring to di&s;burthen his thoughts to me by &s;peech, le&s;t he might be overheard by the centinel, bur&s;t forth into a Welch &s;ong, which he accompanied with a thou&s;and contor|tions of face and violent ge&s;tures of body.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I di&s;cover a &s;ubornation again&s;t me, by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences; in con&s;equence of which, I am &s;et at liber|ty, and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the &s;ame terms&mdash;Mack|&s;hane's malice&mdash;we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a &s;hort time we beat up to Hi&s;paniola, in conjunction with the We&s;t-Indian &s;quadron&mdash;we take in water, &s;ail again, and arrive at Carthagena&mdash;reflections on our conduct there.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MEAN while, a quarrel happening be|tween the two modern Greeks, the one to be revenged of the other, came and di&s;covered to us the my&s;tery of Mack&s;hane's dia|logue, as I have explained it above. This detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who was &s;en&s;ible that (now we were in &s;ight of Ja|maica) we &s;hould have an opportunity of clear|ing our&s;elves before a court-martial, and at the &s;ame time, of making his malice and ignorance con&s;picuous, he interceeded for us with the cap|tain &s;o effectually, that in a few hours we were &s;et at liberty, and ordered to return to our duty.&mdash;This was a happy event for me, my whole body being bli&s;tered by the &s;un, and my limbs benumbed for want of motion: But I could not per&s;uade the Welchman to accept of this in|dulgence,

he per&s;i&s;ting in his ob&s;tinacy to remain in irons until he &s;hould be di&s;charged by a court|martial, which he believed would al&s;o do him ju&s;tice on his enemies; at length, I repre&s;ented to him the precarious i&s;&s;ue of a trial, the power and intere&s;t of his adver&s;aries, and flattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his re&s;ent|ment with his own hands upon Mack&s;hane after our return to England: This la&s;t argument had more weight with him than all the re&s;t, and pre|vailed upon him to repair with me to the cock|pit, which I no &s;ooner entered, than the idea of my departed friend pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my re|membrance, and filled my eyes with tears.&mdash;We di&s;charged from our me&s;s the boy who had acted &s;o perfidiou&s;ly, notwith&s;tanding his tears, in|treaties, and profe&s;&s;ions of penitence for what he had done; but not before he had confe&s;&s;ed that the &s;urgeon had bribed him to give evidence a|gain&s;t us, with a pair of &s;tockings and a couple of old check &s;hirts, which his &s;ervant had &s;ince plundered him of.</P>
<P>The keys of our che&s;ts and lockers being &s;ent to us by the doctor, we detained the me&s;&s;enger until we had examined the contents; and my fellow-mate finding all his Che&s;hire chee&s;e con|&s;umed to a cru&s;t, his brandy exhau&s;ted, and his onions gone, was &s;eized with a fit of choler, which he di&s;charged on Mack&s;hane's man in oaths and execrations, threatning to pro&s;ecute him as a thief.&mdash;The fellow &s;wore in his turn that he never had the keys in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till that time, when he received them from his ma&s;ter, with orders to deliver them to us.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As Got is my judge (cried Morgan) and my &s;alfation, and my witne&s;s, who&s;oever has pilfered my provi&s;ions,

Our fleet having joined another that waited for us, lay at anchor about a month in the harbour of Port-Royal in Jamaica, during which time &s;omething of con&s;equence was certainly tran&s;acted, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;inuations of &s;ome who af|firmed we had no bu&s;ine&s;s at all in that place&mdash;that in order to take the advantage of the &s;ea&s;on proper for our enterprize, the We&s;t-Indian &s;qua|dron, which had previous notice of our coming, ought to have joined us at the we&s;t end of Hi|&s;paniola with nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores and refre&s;hments, from whence we could have &s;ailed directly to Carthagena, before the enemy could put them|&s;elves in a good po&s;ture of defence, or indeed have an inkling of our de&s;ign.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our land forces being di&s;embarked, erect a fa&s;chine battery&mdash;our &s;hip is ordered with four more, to batter the fort of Bocca Chica&mdash;Mack&s;hane's cowardice&mdash;the chap|lain's phrenzy&mdash;hone&s;t Rattlin la&s;es one hand&mdash;his heroi&s;m and reflections on the battle&mdash;Crampley's behaviour to me dur|ing the heat of the fight.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR forces being landed and &s;tationed as I have already mentioned, &s;et about erecting a fa&s;chine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy, and in &s;omething more than three weeks, it was ready to open. That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as po&s;&s;ible, it was determined in a council of war, that five of our large&s;t &s;hips &s;hould attack the fort on one &s;ide, while the battery plyed it on the other, &s;trength|ened with two mortars, and twenty-four co|horns.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the &s;ignal for our &s;hip to engage, among others, was hoi&s;ted, we being adverti&s;ed the night before, to make every thing clear for that purpo&s;e: and in &s;o doing, a difference hap|pened between captain Oakhum and his well-be|loved cou&s;in and coun&s;ellor Mack&s;hane, which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture.&mdash;The doctor, who had imagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy's &s;hot in the
<PB N="283" REF="305">
cockpit than in the center of the earth, was lately informed that a &s;urgeon's mate had been killed in that place, by a cannon-ball from two &s;mall forts, that were de&s;troyed before the di&s;embarkation of our &s;oldiers; and therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon having a platform rai&s;ed for the convenience of the &s;ick and wounded, in the after-hold, where he deemed him&s;elf more &s;ecure than on the deck above.&mdash;The captain, offended at this extraordinary propo&s;al, accu&s;ed him of pu&s;ilanimity, and told him there was no room in the hold for &s;uch an occa&s;ion; or if there was, he could not expect to be in|dulged more than the re&s;t of the &s;urgeons of the navy, who u&s;ed the cockpit for that purpo&s;e: Fear rendering Mack&s;hane ob&s;tinate, he per&s;i&s;ted in his demand, and &s;hewed his in&s;tructions, by which it was authori&s;ed: The captain &s;wore the&s;e in&s;tructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at &s;ea; but was obliged to comply, and &s;ent for the carpenter to give him orders about it: But before any &s;uch mea&s;ure could be taken, our &s;ignal was thrown out, and the doctor compelled to tru&s;t his carca&s;e in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were bu&s;y in put|ting our in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings in order.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip, with the others de&s;tined for this &s;er|vice, immediately weighed, and in le&s;s than half an hour came to an anchor before the ca&s;tle of Bocca Chica, with a &s;pring upon our cable.&mdash;The cannonading (which indeed was terrible!) began. The &s;urgeon, after having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and pur&s;er, who were &s;tationed with us, in quality of a&s;|&s;i&s;tants, followed his example, while the Welch|man and I &s;at upon a che&s;t looking at one ano|ther with great di&s;compo&s;ure, &s;carce able to re|frain

from the like pro&s;tration.&mdash;And that the rea|der may know, it was not a common occa&s;ion that alarmed us thus, I mu&s;t inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that a&s;toni&s;hed us. The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from Bocca Chica mount|ing eighty-four great guns, be&s;ide a mortar and &s;mall arms; from fort St. Jo&s;eph, mounting thirty-&s;ix; from two fa&s;chine batteries, mounting twenty; and from four men of war, mounting &s;ixty-four guns each.&mdash;This was an&s;wered by us, from our land battery, mounting twenty-one cannon; our bomb battery, mounting two mor|tars, and twenty-four cohorns, and five men of war, two of eighty, and three of &s;eventy guns, which fired without intermi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;We had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the &s;ailors brought another on his back to the cockpit, where he to&s;&s;ed him down like a bag of oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth, without &s;peaking a word; Morgan immediately examined the condition of the wounded man, and cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As I &s;hall an|&s;wer now, the man is as tead as my great|grandfather."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dead (&s;aid his comrade) he may be dead now, for ought I know, but I'll be d&mdash;mn'd if he was not alive when I took him up."&mdash;</Q>So &s;aying, he was about to return to his quarters, when I bid him carry the body a|long with him and throw it over-board.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"D&mdash;n the body!

there was &s;carce any body on board, who un|der&s;tood the pointing of a gun.&mdash;Ah! God help us!

Jack Rattlin, &s;candalized at this deport|ment, endeavoured to allay his tran&s;ports with rea|&s;on; but finding all he &s;aid ineffectual, and great confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by his frolicks, he knocked him down with his right hand, and by threats kept him quiet in that &s;tate of humiliation.&mdash;But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the pur&s;er, who &s;at on the floor wringing his hands, and cur&s;ing the hour in which he left his peaceable profe&s;&s;ion of a brewer in Roche&s;ter, to engage in

&s;uch a life of terror and di&s;quiet.&mdash;While we di|verted our&s;elves at the expence of this poor devil, a &s;hot happened to take us between wind and water, and its cour&s;e being through the pur&s;er's &s;tore-room, made a terrible havock and noi&s;e a|mong the jars and bottles in its way, and di&s;con|certed Mack&s;hane &s;o much, that he dropt his &s;calpel, and falling down on his knees, pronounced his <HI>Pater-no&s;ter</HI> aloud; the pur&s;er fell backward and lay without &s;en&s;e or motion; and the chaplain grew &s;o outrageous, that Rattlin with one hand, could not keep him under; &s;o that we were o|bliged to confine him in the &s;urgeon's cabbin, where he was no doubt guilty of a thou&s;and ex|travagancies.&mdash;Much about this time, my old an|tagoni&s;t Crampley came down, with expre&s;s or|ders (as he &s;aid) to bring me up to the quarter|deck, to dre&s;s a &s;light wound the captain had re|ceived by a &s;plinter. His rea&s;on for honouring me in particular with this piece of &s;ervice, being that in ca&s;e I &s;hould be killed or di&s;abled by the way, my death or mutilation would be of le&s;s con&s;equence to the &s;hip's company, than that of the doctor or his fir&s;t mate.&mdash;At another time, perhaps, I might have di&s;puted this order, to which I was not bound to pay the lea&s;t regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance, I was re&s;olved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than he, to ex|po&s;e my&s;elf to danger.&mdash;With this view, I pro|vided my&s;elf with dre&s;&s;ings, and followed him immediately to the quarter-deck, through a mo&s;t infernal &s;cene of &s;laughter, fire, &s;moak, and up|roar!

and my hands dyed with blood, than he &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure by a frown, and a&s;ked why the doctor him&s;elf did not come? I told him Crampley had &s;ingled me out, as if by his expre&s;s command; at which he &s;eemed &s;urprized, and threatened to puni&s;h the mid&s;hipman for his pre&s;umption, after the engagement: In the mean time, I was &s;ent back to my &s;tation, and ordered to tell Mack&s;hane, that the captain expected him immediately.&mdash;I got &s;afe back and delivered up my commi&s;&s;ion to the doctor, who flatly refu&s;ed to quit the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned to him by his in&s;tructions. Hereupon, Morgan, who (I believe) was jealous of my reputation for courage, undertook the affair, and a&s;cended with great intrepidity.&mdash;The captain finding the &s;urgeon ob&s;tinate, &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;wore he would confine Mack&s;hane as &s;oon as that &s;ervice &s;hould be over.</P>

<P>HAVING cannonaded the fort, during the &s;pace of four hours, we were all ordered to &s;lip our cables, and &s;heer off; but next day the engagement was renewed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when the ene|my's fire from Bocca Chica &s;lackened, and to|wards evening was quite &s;ilenced.&mdash;A breach be|ing made on the other &s;ide, by our land-battery, large enough to admit a middle &s;ized baboon,
<PB N="290" REF="312">
provided he could find means to climb up to it; our general propo&s;ed to give the a&s;&s;ault that very night, and actually ordered a detachment on that duty: Providence &s;tood our friend upon this occa&s;ion, and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been maintained by re&s;olute men, to the day of judgment again&s;t all the force we could exert in the attack.&mdash;And while our &s;oldiers took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy's ram|parts, without re&s;i&s;tance, the &s;ame good luck at|tended a body of &s;ailors, who made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of fort St. Jo&s;eph, the fa&s;chine batteries, and one Spani&s;h man of war; the other three being burnt or &s;unk by the foe, that they might not fall into our hands.&mdash;The taking of the&s;e forts, in the &s;trength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided, made us ma&s;ters of the outward harbour, and occa&s;ioned great joy among us; as we laid our accounts with finding little or no op|po&s;ition from the town: And indeed, if a few great &s;hips had &s;ailed up immediately, before they had recovered from the confu&s;ion and de&s;pair that our unexpected &s;ucce&s;s had produced among them, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that we might have fini&s;hed the affair to our &s;atisfaction, without any more blood-&s;hed: but this our Heroes di&s;dained, as a barbarous in&s;ult over the enemy's di&s;tre&s;s; and gave them all the re&s;pite they could de&s;ire, in order to recollect them&s;elves.&mdash;In the mean time, Mack&s;hane taking the advantage of this general exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded his own cau&s;e &s;o effectually, that he was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in his good graces; and as for Crampley, there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me, during the action.&mdash;But of all the
<PB N="291" REF="313">
con&s;equences of the victory, none was more grateful than plenty of fre&s;h water, after we had langui&s;hed five weeks on the allowance of a pur|&s;er's quart <HI>per diem</HI> for each man, in the Torrid Zone, where the &s;un was vertical, and the ex|pence of bodily fluid &s;o great, that a gallon of liquor could &s;carce &s;upply the wa&s;te of twenty|four hours; e&s;pecially, as our provi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of putrid &s;alt beef, to which the &s;ailors gave the name of Iri&s;h hor&s;e; &s;alt pork of New England, which though neither fi&s;h nor fle&s;h, &s;avoured of both; bread from the &s;ame country, every bi&s;cuit whereof, like a piece of clock work, moved by its own internal impul&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the my|riads of in&s;ects that dwelt within it; and butter &s;erved out by the gill, that ta&s;ted like train-oil thickened with &s;alt. In&s;tead of &s;mall-beer, each man was allowed three half quarterns of brandy or rum, which was di&s;tributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of his water, without either &s;ugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which rea&s;on this compo&s;ition, was by the &s;ailors not unaptly &s;tiled <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> Nor was this limitation of &s;imple element owing to a &s;carcity of it on board, there being at this time water enough in the &s;hip for a voyage of &s;ix months, at the rate of half a gallon <HI>per</HI> day to each man: But this fa&s;t mu&s;t (I &s;uppo&s;e) have been injoined by way of pennance on the &s;hip's company for their &s;ins; or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life, that they might thereby become more re&s;olute and regard|le&s;s of danger. How &s;imply then do tho&s;e peo|ple argue, who a&s;cribe the great mortality among us, to our bad provi&s;ion and want of water;

and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been &s;aved, if the u&s;ele&s;s tran&s;ports had been employed in fetching fre&s;h &s;tock, turtle, fruit, and other refre&s;hments, from Jamaica and other adjacent i&s;lands, for the u&s;e of the army and fleet! &s;eeing, it is to be hoped, that tho&s;e who died went to a better place, and tho&s;e who &s;ur|vived were the more ea&s;ily maintained.&mdash;After all, a &s;ufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like their own country ma&s;tifs, which &s;hut their eyes, run into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads cru&s;hed for their valour.</P>
<P>But to return to my narration: After having put garri&s;ons into the forts we had taken, and re-imbarked our &s;oldiers and artillery, which de|tained us more than a week, we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one &s;ide, and a &s;mall re|doubt on the other, both of which were de&s;erted before our approach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by &s;everal old galleons that the enemy had &s;unk in the channel.&mdash;We made &s;hift, however, to open a pa&s;&s;age for &s;ome &s;hips of war, that favoured the &s;econd landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from the town, where, after a faint re&s;i&s;tance from a body of Spaniards, who oppo&s;ed their di&s;embarka|tion, they encamped with a de&s;ign of be&s;ieging the ca&s;tle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and commanded the city: Whether our renowned general had no body in his army who knew how to approach it in form, or that he tru&s;ted in|tirely to the fame of his arms, I &s;hall not deter|mine; but certain it is, a re&s;olution was taken in
<PB N="293" REF="315">
a council of war, to attack the place with mu&s;|quetry only, which was put in execution, and &s;ucceeded accordingly; the enemy giving them &s;uch an hearty reception, that the greate&s;t part of the detachment took up their everla&s;ting re|&s;idence on the &s;pot.&mdash;Our chief not reli&s;hing this kind of complai&s;ance in the Spaniards, was wi&s;e enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army, which, from eight thou&s;and able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for &s;ervice.&mdash;The &s;ick and wounded were &s;queezed into certain ve&s;&s;els, which thence obtained the name of ho&s;|pital &s;hips, though methinks they &s;carce de&s;erved &s;uch a creditable title, &s;eeing none of them could boa&s;t of either &s;urgeon, nur&s;e or cook; and the &s;pace between decks was &s;o confined, that the mi&s;erable patients had not room to &s;it upright in their beds. Their wounds and &s;tumps being ne|glected, contracted filth and putrefaction, and millions of maggots were hatched amid the cor|ruption of their &s;ores.

<P>A day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the admiral ordered one of the Spani&s;h men of war we had taken, to be mounted with &s;ixteen guns, and manned with detachments from our great &s;hips, in order to batter the town; accord|ingly, &s;he was towed into the inner harbour in the night-time, and moored within half a mile of the walls, again&s;t which &s;he began to fire at day|break; and continued about four hours expo&s;ed to the oppo&s;ition of at lea&s;t forty pieces of can|non, which at length obliged our men to &s;et her on fire, and get off as well as they could, in their boats.&mdash;This piece of conduct afforded mat|ter of &s;peculation to all the wits, either in the army or the navy, who were at la&s;t fain to ac|knowledge it a &s;troke of policy above their com|prehen&s;ion.&mdash;Some entertained &s;uch an irreve|rent

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE change of the atmo&s;phere, occa&s;ioned by this phoenomenon, con&s;pired with the &s;tench that &s;urrounded us, the heat of the climate, our own con&s;titutions impoveri&s;hed by bad pro|vi&s;ion, and our de&s;pair, to introduce the bilious fever among us, which raged with &s;uch violence that three fourths of tho&s;e whom it invaded, died in a deplorable manner; the colour of their &s;kin, being by the extreme putrefaction of their juices, changed into that of &s;oot.</P>
<P>Our conductors finding things in this &s;ituation, perceived it was high time to relinqui&s;h our con|que&s;ts, which we did, after having rendered their
<PB N="298" REF="320">
artillery u&s;ele&s;s and blown up their walls with gun-powder.&mdash;Ju&s;t as we &s;ailed from Bocca Chica on our return to Jamaica, I found my&s;elf threa|tened with the &s;ymptoms of this terrible di&s;temper; and knowing very well that I &s;tood no chance for my life, if I &s;hould be obliged to lie in the cockpit, which by this time, was grown intolerable even to people in health, by rea&s;on of the heat and unwhol&s;ome &s;mell of decayed provi&s;ion; I wrote a petition to the captain repre&s;enting my ca&s;e, and humbly imploring his permi&s;&s;ion to lie among the &s;oldiers in the middle-deck, for the benefit of the air: But I might have &s;pared my&s;elf the trouble; for this humane commander refu&s;ed my reque&s;t, and ordered me to continue in the place allotted for the &s;urgeon's mates, or el&s;e be contented to lie in the ho&s;pital, which, by the bye, was three degrees more offen&s;ive and more &s;uffocating than our own birth below.&mdash;Another in my condition, perhaps, would have &s;ubmitted to his fate, and died in a pet; but I could not brook the thought of peri&s;hing &s;o pitifully, after I had weathered &s;o many gales of hard for|tune: I therefore, without minding Oakhum's injunction, prevailed upon the &s;oldiers (who&s;e good-will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among them; and actually congratulated my&s;elf upon my comfortable &s;ituation, which Crampley no &s;ooner under&s;tood, than he &s;ignified to the captain, my contempt of his orders; and was inve&s;ted with power to turn me down again into my proper habitation.&mdash;This barbarous piece of revenge, incen&s;ed me &s;o much again&s;t the author, that I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call him to a &s;evere account, if ever it &s;hould be in
<PB N="299" REF="321">
my power; and the agitation of my &s;pirits in|crea&s;ed my fever to a violent degree.&mdash;While I lay ga&s;ping for breath in this infernal abode, I was vi&s;ited by a &s;erjeant, the bones of who&s;e no&s;e I had reduced and &s;et to rights, after they had been demoli&s;hed by a &s;plinter during our la&s;t en|gagement: He being informed of my condition, offered me the u&s;e of his birth in the middle|deck, which was inclo&s;ed with canvas and well|aired by a port-hole that remained open within it.&mdash;I embraced this propo&s;al with joy, and was immediately conducted to the place, where I was treated, while my illne&s;s la&s;ted, with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and care by this grateful halberdier, who had no other bed for him&s;elf than a hen|coop, during the whole pa&s;&s;age&mdash;Here I lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwith&s;tanding of which, my malady gained ground, and at length my life was de&s;paired of, though I never lo&s;t hopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to &s;ee, from my cabbin window, &s;ix or &s;even thrown over-board every day, who died of the &s;ame di&s;|temper. This confidence, I am per&s;uaded, con|duced a good deal to the pre&s;ervation of my life, e&s;pecially, when joined to another re&s;olution I took at the beginning, namely, to refu&s;e all medicine, which I could not help thinking co-operated with the di&s;ea&s;e, and in&s;tead of re&s;i&s;ting putrefaction, pro|moted a total degeneracy of the vital fluid.&mdash;When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought his diaphore|tic bolu&s;es, I put them in my mouth, 'tis true, but without any intention of &s;wallowing them; and when he went away, &s;pit them out, and wa&s;hed my mouth with water-gruel: I &s;eemingly com|plied in this manner, that I might not affront the
<PB N="300" REF="322">
blood of Caractacus, by a refu&s;al which might have intimated a diffidence of his phy&s;ical capa|city; for he acted as my phy&s;ician; doctor Mac|&s;hane never once enquiring about me, or even knowing where I was.&mdash;When my di&s;temper was at the height, Morgan thought my ca&s;e de&s;|perate, and after having applied a bli&s;ter to the nape of my neck, &s;queezed my hand, bidding me, with a woful countenance, recommend my|&s;elf to Got and my reteemer; then taking his leave, de&s;ired the chaplain to come and admini|&s;ter &s;ome &s;piritual con&s;olation to me; but before he arrived, I had made &s;hift to rid my&s;elf of the trouble&s;ome application the Welchman had be|&s;towed on my back.&mdash;The par&s;on having felt my pul&s;e, enquired into the nature of my complaints, hemmed a little, and began thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Ran|dom, God out of his infinite mercy hath been plea&s;ed to vi&s;it you with a dreadful di&s;temper, the i&s;&s;ue of which no man knows.&mdash;You may be permitted to recover, and live many days on the face of the earth: and, which is more probable, you may be taken away and cut off in the flower of your youth: It is incumbent on you, there|fore, to prepare for the great change, by repent|ing &s;incerely of your &s;ins; of this there cannot be a greater &s;ign, than an ingen'ous confe&s;&s;ion, which I conjure you to make, without he&s;ita|ton or mental re&s;ervation; and when I am convinced of your &s;incerity, I will then give you &s;uch comfort as the &s;ituation of your &s;oul will admit of.

re&s;erve, the particulars of each, e&s;pecially of the la&s;t, that I may be acquainted with the true &s;tate of your con&s;cience: For no phy&s;ician will pre&s;cribe for his patient until he knows the circum&s;tances of his di&s;ea&s;e."</Q> As I was not under any apprehen&s;ions of death, I could not help &s;miling at the doctor's inqui&s;itive remon|&s;trance, which I told him &s;avoured more of the Roman than of the Prote&s;tant church, in recom|mending auricular confe&s;&s;ion, a thing, in my opi|nion, not at all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, and which, for that rea&s;on, I declined.&mdash;This reply di&s;con|certed him a little; however, he explained away his meaning, in making learned di&s;tinctions be|tween what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and what was only convenient; then proceeded to a&s;k what religion I profe&s;&s;ed: I an&s;wered, that I had not as yet con&s;idered the difference of religions, con|&s;equently had not fixed on any one in particular, but that I was bred a Pre&s;byterian.&mdash;At this word the chaplain di&s;covered great a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;aid, he could not comprehend how a Pre&s;|byterian was entitled to any po&s;t under the En|gli&s;h government.&mdash;Then he a&s;ked if I had ever received the Sacrament, or taken the oaths; to which I replying in the negative, he held up his hands, a&s;&s;ured me he could do me no &s;ervice, wi&s;hed I might not be in a &s;tate of reprobation; and returned to his me&s;s-mates, who were mak|ing merry in the ward-room, round a table well &s;tored with bumbo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bumbo is a liquor compo&s;ed of rum, &s;ugar, wa|ter and nutmeg.</NOTE> and wine.&mdash;This in&s;inua|tion, terrible as it was, had not &s;uch an effect upon me, as the fever, which, &s;oon after he had
<PB N="302" REF="324">
left me, grew outragious; I began to &s;ee &s;trange chimeras, and concluded my&s;elf on the point of becoming delirious: But before that happened, was in great danger of &s;uffocation, upon which I &s;tarted up in a kind of frantic fit, with an in|tention to plunge my&s;elf into the &s;ea, and as my friend the &s;erjeant was not pre&s;ent, would certain|ly have cooled my&s;elf to &s;ome purpo&s;e, had I not perceived a moi&s;ture upon my thigh, as I endea|voured to get out of my hammock: The ap|pearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and re&s;olution enough to take the advantage of this favourable &s;ymptom, by tearing the &s;hirt from my body and the &s;heets from my bed, and wrapping my&s;elf in a thick blanket, in which inclo&s;ure, for about a quarter of an hour, I felt the pains of hell; but it was not long before I was recompen&s;ed for my &s;uffering by a profu&s;e &s;weat, that bur&s;ting from the whole &s;urface of my &s;kin, in le&s;s than two hours, re|lieved me from all my complaints, except that of weakne&s;s; and left me as hungry as a kite.&mdash;I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling my&s;elf with the agreeable reverie of my fu|ture happine&s;s, when I heard Morgan, on the out&s;ide of the curtain, a&s;k the &s;erjeant, if I was &s;till alive? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alive! (cried the other) God forbid he &s;hould be otherwi&s;e! he has lain quiet the&s;e five hours, and I do not chu&s;e to di&s;turb him, for &s;leep will do him great &s;ervice."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, (&s;aid my fellow-mate) he &s;leeps &s;o &s;ound, (look you) that he will never waken till the great trump plows.&mdash;Got be merciful to his &s;oul.&mdash;He has paid his debt, like an hone&s;t man.&mdash;Ay, and moreover, he is at re&s;t from all per&s;ecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of

which, Got knows, and I know, he had his own &s;hare.&mdash;Ochree!

I &s;hould not have been able to contain my&s;elf much longer, when he began to perform the la&s;t duty of a friend, in clo&s;ing my eyes and my mouth; upon which, I &s;udden|ly &s;napped at his fingers, and di&s;compo&s;ed him &s;o much, that he &s;tarted back, turned pale as a&s;hes, and &s;tared like the picture of horror! Although I could not help laughing at his appearance, I was concerned for his &s;ituation, and &s;tretched out my hand, telling him, I hoped to live and eat &s;ome &s;almagundy of his making in England.&mdash;It was &s;ome time before he could recollect him&s;elf &s;o far as to feel my pul&s;e, and enquire into the par|ticulars of my di&s;ea&s;e: But when he found I had enjoyed a favourable cri&s;is, he congratulated me upon my good fortune; not failing to a&s;cribe it, under Got, to the bli&s;ter he had applied to my back, at his la&s;t vi&s;it; which, by the bye, &s;aid
<PB N="304" REF="326">
he, mu&s;t now be removed and dre&s;&s;ed: He was actually going to fetch dre&s;&s;ings, when I feign|ing a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ble&s;s me! &s;ure you never applied a bli&s;ter to me&mdash;there is nothing on my back, I a&s;&s;ure you."&mdash;</Q>Of this he could not be convinced till he had examined, and then endeavoured to conceal his confu&s;ion, by expre&s;|&s;ing his &s;urprize in finding the &s;kin untouched, and the plai&s;ter mi&s;&s;ing.&mdash;In order to excu&s;e my|&s;elf for paying &s;o little regard to his pre&s;cription, I pretended to have been in&s;en&s;ible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards, in a fit of delirium. This apology &s;atisfied my friend, who on this occa&s;ion abated a good deal of his &s;tiffne&s;s in regard to punctilios; and as we were now &s;afely arrived at Jamaica, where I had the benefit of fre&s;h provi&s;ion, and other refre&s;h|ments, I recovered &s;trength every day, and in a &s;hort time, my health and vigour were perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;When I got up at fir&s;t, and was ju&s;t able to crawl about the deck, with a &s;taff in my hand, I met doctor Mack&s;hane, who pa&s;&s;ed by me with a di&s;dainful look, and did not vouch&s;afe to honour me with one word: After him came Crampley, who &s;trutting up to me, with a fierce countenance, pronounced, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here's fine di&s;cipline on board, when &s;uch lazy &s;culk|ing &s;ons of b&mdash;ches as you, are allowed, on pretence of &s;ickne&s;s, to lollop at your ea&s;e, while your betters are kept to hard duty!"&mdash;</Q>The &s;ight and behaviour of this malicious &s;coun|drel, enraged me &s;o much, that I could &s;carce re|frain from laying my cudgel acro&s;s his pate; but when I con&s;idered my pre&s;ent feeblene&s;s, and the enemies I had in the &s;hip, who wanted only

a pretence to ruin me, I re&s;trained my pa&s;&s;ion, and contented my&s;elf with telling him, I had not forgot his in&s;olence and malice, and that I hoped we &s;hould meet one day on &s;hore.&mdash;At this he grinned, &s;hook his fi&s;t at me, and &s;wore he longed for nothing more than &s;uch an opportunity.</P>
<P>Mean while, our &s;hip was ordered to be heaved down, victualled and watered, for her return to England; and our captain, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, not thinking it convenient for him to re|vi&s;it his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman, who on the other hand, wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much, as to be &s;afe without the tropick; all his care and tenderne&s;s of him&s;elf, being in&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve his complexion from the injuries of the &s;un and weather.</P>
<P>Our tyrant having left the &s;hip, and carried his favourite Mack&s;hane along with him, to my in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction; our new commander came on board, in a ten-oar'd barge, over&s;hadowed with a va&s;t umbrella, and appeared in every thing quite the rever&s;e of Oakhum, being a tall, thin, young man, dre&s;&s;ed in this manner; a white hat garni&s;hed with a red feather, adorned his head, from whence his hair flowed down upon his &s;houlders, in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon.&mdash;His coat, con&s;i&s;ting of pink-coloured &s;ilk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut retired backward, as it were, to di&s;cover a white &s;attin wai&s;tcoat embroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part, to di&s;play a broch &s;et with gar|nets, that glittered in the brea&s;t of his &s;hirt, which was of the fine&s;t cambrick, edged with right mechlin: The knees of his crim&s;on velvet breeches &s;carce de&s;cended &s;o low as to meet his

<P>HE was going on, with an elogium upon the captain, when I received a me&s;&s;age to clean my&s;elf, and go up to the great cabbin, which I immediately performed, &s;weetening my&s;elf with ro&s;e-water from the medicine-che&s;t. When I entered the room, I was ordered to &s;tand by
<PB N="310" REF="332">
the door, until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred me at a di&s;tance, with a &s;py-gla&s;s, who having con&s;ulted one &s;en&s;e in this manner, bid me ad|vance gradually, that his no&s;e might have intelli|gence, before it could be much offended: I there|fore approached with great caution and &s;ucce&s;s, and he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ay, this creature is tolerable."&mdash;</Q>I found him lolling on his couch with a langui&s;hing air, his head &s;upported by his <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> who from time to time applied a &s;melling-bottle to his no&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vergette, (&s;aid he, in a &s;queaking tone) do&s;t thou think this wretch (meaning me) will do me no injury? may I venture to &s;ubmit my arm to him?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pon my vord, (replied the valet) I do tink dat dere be great occa&s;ion for your honour lo&s;ing one &s;mall quantite of blodt; and the yong mun ave qulque cho&s;e of de bonne mine.&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well then (&s;aid his ma&s;ter) I think I mu&s;t venture."&mdash;</Q>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ha&s;t thou ever blooded any body but brutes?&mdash;But I need not a&s;k thee, for thou wilt tell me a mo&s;t damnable lie."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Brutes, Sir, (an&s;wered I, pulling down his glove in order to feel his pul&s;e) I never meddle with brutes."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What the devil art thou about?

What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board with|out my own &s;urgeon, Mr. Simper."&mdash;</Q>I craved pardon for having handled him &s;o roughly, and with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s tied up his arm with a fillet of &s;ilk. While I was &s;eeling
<PB N="311" REF="333">
for the vein, he de&s;ired to know how much blood I intended to take from him, and when I an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not above twelve ounces;"</Q> &s;tarted up with a look full of horror, and bid me begone, &s;wearing I had a de&s;ign upon his life.&mdash;Vergette appea&s;ed him with &s;ome difficulty, and opening a bureau, took out a pair of &s;cales, in one of which was placed a &s;mall cup; and putting them into my hand, told me, the captain never lo&s;t a|bove an ounce and three drachms at one time.&mdash;While I prepared for this important evacua|tion, there came into the cabbin, a young man, gayly dre&s;&s;ed, of a very delicate complexion, with a kind of languid &s;mile on his face, which &s;eemed to have been rendered habitual, by a long cour&s;e of affectation.&mdash;The captain no &s;ooner perceived him, than ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, he flew into his arms, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O! my dear Simper! I am exce&s;&s;ive|ly di&s;ordered! I have been betrayed, frigh|ted, murdered by the negligence of my &s;er|vants, who &s;uffered a bea&s;t, a mule, a bear to &s;urprize me, and &s;tink me into convul&s;ions with the fumes of tobacco."&mdash;</Q>Simper, who by this time, I found, was obliged to art for the clearne&s;s of his complexion, a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;ympathy, and lamented with many tender expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, the &s;ad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then feeling his patient's pul&s;e on the out&s;ide of his glove, gave it as his opinion, that his di&s;order was entirely ner|vous, and that &s;ome drops of tincture of ca&s;tor and liquid laudanum, would be of more &s;ervice to him than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate &s;allies of his &s;pirits, and compo&s;ing the fermenta|tion of his bile proceeding therefrom.&mdash;I was
<PB N="312" REF="334">
therefore &s;ent to prepare this pre&s;cription, which was admini&s;tred in a gla&s;s of &s;ack-po&s;&s;et, after the captain had been put to bed, and orders &s;ent to the officers on the quarter-deck, to let no body walk on that &s;ide under which he lay.</P>
<P>While the captain enjoyed his repo&s;e, the doc|tor watched over him, and indeed became &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that a cabin was made for him contigu|ous to the &s;tate-room, where Whiffle &s;lept; that he might be at hand in ca&s;e of accidents in the night.&mdash;Next day, our commander being hap|pily recovered, gave orders, that none of the lieu|tenants &s;hould appear upon deck, without a wig, &s;word, and ruffles; nor any mid&s;hipman, or o|ther petty officer, be &s;een with a check &s;hirt or dirty linen.&mdash;He al&s;o prohibited any per&s;on what|ever, except Simper and his own &s;ervants, from coming into the great cabbin, without fir&s;t &s;end|ing in to obtain leave.&mdash;The&s;e &s;ingular regulations did not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;hip's company in his fa|vour; but on the contrary, gave &s;candal an op|portunity to be very bu&s;y with his character, and accu&s;e him of maintaining a corre&s;pondence with his &s;urgeon, not fit to be named.</P>
<P>In a few weeks, our &s;hip was under &s;ailing orders, and I was in hopes of re-vi&s;iting my na|tive country in a very &s;hort time, when the ad|miral's &s;urgeon came on board, and &s;ending for Morgan and me to the quarter-deck, gave me to under&s;tand, there was a great &s;carcity of &s;urgeons in the We&s;t-Indies, that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great &s;hip that was bound for England; and de&s;ired us to agree among our&s;elves, before the next day at that hour, which of us &s;hould &s;tay behind.&mdash;We
<PB N="313" REF="335">
were thunder-&s;truck at this propo&s;al, and &s;tared at one another &s;ome time, without &s;peaking; at length the Welchman broke &s;ilence, and offered to remain in the We&s;t-Indies, provided the ad|miral would give him a &s;urgeon's warrant imme|diately: But he was told there was no want of chief &s;urgeons, and that he mu&s;t be contented with the &s;tation of mate, till he &s;hould be further provided for in due cour&s;e: Whereupon Morgan flatly refu&s;ed to quit the &s;hip for which the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the navy had appointed him; and the other told him as plainly, that if we could not determine the affair by our&s;elves before to|morrow morning, he mu&s;t ca&s;t lots, and abide by his chance.&mdash;When I recalled to my remem|brance the mi&s;eries I had undergone in England, where I had not one friend to promote my inte|re&s;t, or favour my advancement in the navy, and at the &s;ame time, reflected on the pre&s;ent dearth of &s;urgeons in the We&s;t-Indies, and the un|healthine&s;s of the climate, which every day, al|mo&s;t, reduced the number, I could not help thinking my &s;ucce&s;s would be much more cer|tain and expeditious, by &s;taying where I was, than by returning to Europe.&mdash;I therefore re|&s;olved to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw dice, told Morgan, he needed not trouble him&s;elf, for I would voluntarily &s;ubmit to the admiral's plea|&s;ure.&mdash;This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman, who a&s;&s;ured me, it &s;hould not fare the wor&s;e with me for my re&s;ignation: Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very after|noon, procured a warrant, appointing me &s;ur|geon's mate of the Lizzard &s;loop of war, which
<PB N="314" REF="336">
put me on a footing with every fir&s;t mate in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>My ticket being made out, I put my che&s;t and bedding on board a canoe that was along|&s;ide, and having &s;hook hands with my tru&s;ty friend the &s;erjeant, and hone&s;t Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich-ho&s;pital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had exchanged our &s;leeve-buttons as remembrances of each other.&mdash;Having pre&s;ented my new war|rant to the captain of the Lizard, I enquired for the doctor, whom I no &s;ooner &s;aw, than I recollected him to be one of tho&s;e young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round-hou&s;e, during our frolick with Jack&s;on, as I have related be|fore.&mdash;He received me with a good deal of cour|te&s;y, and when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance, expre&s;&s;ed great joy in &s;eeing me a|gain, and recommended me to an exceeding good me&s;s, compo&s;ed of the gunner and the ma&s;ter's mate.&mdash;As there was not one &s;ick per&s;on in the &s;hip, I got leave to go a&s;hore, next day, with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket, at the rate of 40 <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count; and having furni&s;hed my&s;elf with what nece&s;&s;aries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and to my great &s;urprize, found my old antagoni&s;t Crampley walking upon deck.&mdash;Tho' I did not fear his enmity, I was &s;hocked at his appearance, and communicated my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject to Mr. Tomlins the &s;urgeon, who told me, that Crampley, by the dint of &s;ome friends about the admiral, had procured a commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituting him lieutenant on board the Lizzard: and advi&s;ed me, now he was my &s;uperior officer,
<PB N="315" REF="337">
to behave with &s;ome re&s;pect towards him, or el&s;e he would find a thou&s;and opportunities of u&s;ing me ill.&mdash;This advice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and re&s;entment had rendered utterly incapable of the lea&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, or even of reconciliation with the wretch, who had, on many occa&s;ions, treated me &s;o inhumanly: However, I re&s;olved to have as little connexion as po&s;&s;ible with him, and to ingratiate my&s;elf as much as I could with the re&s;t of the officers, who&s;e friend|&s;hip might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of his malice.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a week we &s;ailed on a cruize, and having got round the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, had the good fortune to take a Spani&s;h Barcolongo, with her prize, which was an Engli&s;h &s;hip bound for Bri&s;tol, that &s;ailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the pri&s;oners who were well, were put on &s;hore on the north-&s;ide of the i&s;land; the prizes were manned with En|gli&s;hmen, and the command of the Barcolongo, given to my friend the ma&s;ter's mate, with or|ders to carry them into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizzard's cruize &s;hould be end|ed, at which time &s;he would touch at the &s;ame place in her way to Port-Royal.&mdash;With him I was &s;ent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Engli&s;hmen, who amounted to &s;ixteen, and to take care of them on &s;hore, in a hou&s;e that was to be hired as an ho&s;pital.&mdash;This de&s;tination gave me a great deal of plea&s;ure, as I would, for &s;ome time, be freed from the arrogance of Crampley, who&s;e inveteracy again&s;t me had already broke out on two or three occa&s;ions, &s;ince he was be|come a lieutenant.&mdash;My me&s;s-mate, who very
<PB N="316" REF="338">
much re&s;embled my uncle, both in figure and di&s;po&s;ition, treated me on board of the prize, with the utmo&s;t civility and confidence; and a|mong other favours, made me a pre&s;ent of a &s;ilver hilted hanger, and a pair of pi&s;tols mounted with the &s;ame metal, which fell to his &s;hare in plun|dering the enemy.&mdash;We arrived &s;afely at Mo|rant, and going a&s;hore, pitched upon an empty &s;tore-hou&s;e, which we hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next day, with beds and other nece&s;&s;aries; and four of the &s;hip's company appointed to attend them, and obey me.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;trange adventure&mdash;in con&s;equence of which I am extremely happy&mdash;Crampley does me ill offices with the captain: But his ma|lice is defeated by the good-nature and friend&s;hip of the &s;urgeon&mdash;we return to Port-Royal&mdash;our captain gets the com|mand of a larger &s;hip, and is &s;ucceeded by an old man&mdash;Brayl is provided for&mdash;we receive orders to &s;ail for England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander, who&s;e name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the hou&s;e of a rich planter, with whom he was acquainted; where we were &s;umptuou&s;ly enter|tained,
<PB N="317" REF="339">
and in the evening &s;et out on our return to the &s;hip. When we had walked about a mile by moon-light, we perceived a hor&s;eman be|hind us, who coming up, wi&s;hed us <HI>good even,</HI> and a&s;ked which way we went: His voice, which was quite familiar to me, no &s;ooner &s;truck my ear, than, in &s;pite of all my re&s;olution and reflection, my hair bri&s;tled up, and I was &s;eized with a vio|lent fit of trembling, which Brayl mi&s;-interpret|ing, bid me be under no concern, for he would &s;tand by me.&mdash;I told him, he was mi&s;taken in the cau&s;e of my di&s;order; and addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the per&s;on on hor&s;e-back, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I could have &s;worn by your voice, that you was a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of his death."&mdash;</Q>To this, after &s;ome pau&s;e, he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There are many voices as well as faces that re&s;emble one another; but pray, what was your friend's name?"</Q> I &s;atisfied him in that particular, and gave a &s;hort detail of the melancholy fate of Thom&s;on, not without many &s;ighs and &s;ome tears. A &s;ilence en&s;ued which la&s;ted &s;ome minutes, and then the conver&s;ation turned on indifferent &s;ubjects, till we arrived at a hou&s;e on the road, where the hor&s;eman alighted, and begged with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;But if I was alarmed at his voice, what mu&s;t my amazement be, when I di&s;covered by the light, the very per&s;on of my lamented friend! Perceiving my confu&s;ion, which was ex|treme, he cla&s;ped me in his arms and bedewed my face with tears.&mdash;It was &s;ome time ere I re|covered the u&s;e of my rea&s;on, overpowered with this event, and longer &s;till before I could &s;peak.
<PB N="318" REF="340">
So that all I was capable of, was to return his embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; while hone&s;t Brayl, affected with the &s;cene, wept as fa&s;t as either of us, and &s;ig|nified his participation of our happine&s;s, by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a mad-man.&mdash;At length I retrieved the u&s;e of my tongue, and cried, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it po&s;&s;ible, can you be my friend Thom&s;on? No certainly, alas! he was drowned! and I am now under the deception of a dream!"&mdash;</Q>Then I relap&s;ed into tears.&mdash;He was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual per&s;on whom I re|gretted, and bidding me &s;it down and compo&s;e my&s;elf, promi&s;ed to explain his &s;udden di&s;appear|ance from the Thunder, and to account for his being at pre&s;ent in the land of the living.&mdash;This he acquitted him&s;elf of, after I had drank a gla&s;s of punch, and recollected my&s;elf; by informing us, that with a determination to rid him&s;elf of a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, he had gone in the night|time to the head, while the &s;hip was on her way, from whence he &s;lipped down, as &s;oftly as he could by the bows, into the &s;ea, where, after he was heartily ducked, he began to repent of his precipitation, and as he could &s;wim very well, kept him&s;elf above water, in hopes of being taken up by &s;ome of the &s;hips a&s;tern;&mdash;that in this &s;i|tuation, he hailed a large ve&s;&s;el and begged to be taken in, but was an&s;wered, that &s;he was a hea|vy &s;ailor, and therefore they did not chu&s;e to lo&s;e time, by bringing to; however, they threw an old che&s;t over-board, for his convenience, and told him, that &s;ome of the &s;hips a-&s;tern would cer|tainly &s;ave him;&mdash;that no other ve&s;&s;el came
<PB N="319" REF="341">
within &s;ight or cry of him, for the &s;pace of three hours, during which time he had the mortifica|tion of finding him&s;elf in the middle of the ocean alone, without &s;upport or re&s;ting-place, but what a few crazy boards afforded; till at la&s;t, he di&s;cerned a &s;mall &s;loop &s;teering towards him, upon which he &s;et up his throat, and had the good for|tune to be heard and re&s;cued from the dreary wa&s;te, by their boat, which was hoi&s;ted out on purpo&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was no &s;ooner brought on board (continued he) than I fainted; and when I recovered my &s;en&s;es, found my&s;elf in bed, re|galed with a mo&s;t noi&s;ome &s;mell of onions and chee&s;e, which made me think at fir&s;t, that I was in my own hammock, along-&s;ide of hone&s;t Morgan, and that all which had pa&s;&s;ed was no more than a dream.&mdash;Upon enquiry I under&s;tood that I was on board of a &s;chooner belonging to Rhode I&s;land, bound for Jamaica, with a cargo of gee&s;e, pigs, onions, and chee&s;e; and that the ma&s;ter's name was Robert&s;on, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at fir&s;t &s;ight to be an old &s;chool-fellow of mine.&mdash;When I di&s;covered my&s;elf to him, he was tran&s;ported with &s;urprize and joy, and begged to know the occa&s;ion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to di&s;clo&s;e, becau&s;e I knew his notions with regard to religion, were very &s;evere and confined; therefore contented my|&s;elf with telling him, I fell over-board by ac|cident; but made no &s;cruple of explaining the nature of my di&s;agreeable &s;tation, and of ac|quainting him with my determined purpo&s;e never to return to the Thunder man of war."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Although he was not of my opinion in that
<PB N="320" REF="342">
particular, knowing that I mu&s;t lo&s;e my cloaths, and what pay was due to me, unle&s;s I went back to my duty; yet, when I de&s;cribed the circum&s;tances of the helli&s;h life I led, under the tyrannic &s;way of Oakhum and Mack&s;hane; and among other grievances, hinted a di&s;&s;atisfaction at the irreligious deport|ment of my &s;hip-mates, and the want of the true Pre&s;byterian go&s;pel doctrine; he changed his &s;entiments, and conjured me with great ve|hemence and zeal to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of ri&s;ing in the navy; and that he might &s;hew how much he had my intere&s;t at heart, under|took to provide for me in &s;ome &s;hape or other, before he &s;hould leave Jamaica.&mdash;This he performed to my heart's de&s;ire, by recom|mending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom I have lived ever &s;ince, in quality of &s;ur|geon and over&s;eer to his plantations.&mdash;He and his lady are now at King&s;ton, &s;o that I am, for the pre&s;ent, ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e, to which, from my &s;oul, I bid you welcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the remaining part of the night."&mdash;</Q>I needed not a &s;econd invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and excellent officer, could not be per|&s;uaded to &s;leep out of the &s;hip: However, he &s;upped with us, and after having drank a chear|ful gla&s;s, &s;et out for the ve&s;&s;el, which was not above three miles from the place, e&s;corted by a couple of &s;tout Negroes, whom Mr. Thom&s;on ordered to conduct him.&mdash;Never were two friends more happy in the conver&s;ation of one another than we, for the time it la&s;ted: I related to him the particulars of our attempt upon Car|thagena,

of which he had heard but an imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little incident of his life &s;ince we parted.&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured me, it was with the utmo&s;t reluc|tance, he could re&s;i&s;t his inclination of coming down to Port-Royal to &s;ee Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings &s;ince the day of our &s;eparation; but that he was re&s;trained by the fear of being detained as a de&s;erter.&mdash;He told me, that when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almo&s;t as much &s;urprized as I was at &s;eeing him afterwards; and in the confidence of friend|&s;hip, di&s;clo&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his de&s;cription, was a very ami|able young lady, and did not di&s;tain his addre&s;&s;es; that he was very much favoured by her parents, and did not de&s;pair of obtaining their con&s;ent to the match, which would at once render him in|dependent of the world.&mdash;I congratulated him on his good fortune, which he prote&s;ted &s;hould never make him forget his friend; and towards morn|ing we betook our&s;elves to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day he accompanied me to the &s;hip, where Mr. Brayl entertained him at dinner, and having &s;pent the afternoon together, he took his leave of us in the evening, after he had forced upon me ten pi&s;toles, as a &s;mall token of his affec|tion.&mdash;In &s;hort, while we &s;taid here, we &s;aw one another every day, and generally eat at the &s;ame table, which was plentifully &s;upplied by him, with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat, o|ranges, limes, lemons, pine-aples, Madeira-wine, and excellent rum; &s;o that this &s;mall interval of ten days, was by far the mo&s;t agreeable period of my life.</P>

At length, the Lizzard arrived; and as my patients were all fit for duty, they and I were ordered on board of her, where I under&s;tood from Mr. Tomlins, that there was a dryne&s;s be|tween the lieutenant and him, on my account; that rancorous villain having taken the opportu|nity of my ab&s;ence, to fill the captain's ears with a thou&s;and &s;candalous &s;tories, to my prejudice; among other things affirming, that I had been once tran&s;ported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipt for the &s;ame crime.&mdash;The &s;urgeon, on the other hand, having heard my whole &s;tory from my own mouth, defended me &s;trenuou&s;ly, and in the cour&s;e of that good-natured office, recounted all the in&s;tances of Crampley's malice again&s;t me, while I remained on board of that &s;hip.&mdash;Which declaration, while it &s;atisfied the captain of my innocence, made the lieutenant as much my de|fender's enemy as mine. This infernal behaviour of Crampley, with regard to me, added &s;uch fuel to my former re&s;entment, that at certain times, I was quite be&s;ide my&s;elf with the de&s;ire of revenge, and was even tempted to pi&s;tol him on the quar|ter-deck, though an infamous death mu&s;t in|evitably have been my reward.&mdash;But the &s;urgeon, who was my confident, argued again&s;t &s;uch a de&s;perate action &s;o effectually, that I &s;tifled the flame which con&s;umed me for the pre&s;ent, and re&s;olved to wait a more convenient opportu|nity.&mdash;In the mean time, that Mr. Tomlins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I &s;uffered by this fellow's &s;lander, I begged he would go and vi&s;it Mr. Thom&s;on, who&s;e wonder|ful e&s;cape I had made him acquainted with, and

enquire of him into the particulars of my con|duct, while he was my fellow-mate. This the &s;urgeon complied with, more through curio&s;ity to &s;ee a per&s;on who&s;e fate had been &s;o extraordi|nary, than to confirm his good opinion of me, which, he a&s;&s;ured me, was already firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.&mdash;He therefore &s;et out for the dwelling|place of my friend, with a letter of introduction from me; and being received with all the civility and kindne&s;s I expected, returned to the &s;hip, not only &s;atisfied with my character, beyond the power of doubt or in&s;inuation, but al&s;o charmed with the affability and conver&s;ation of Thom&s;on, who loaded him and me with pre&s;ents of fre&s;h &s;tock, liquors and fruit. As he would not ven|ture to come and &s;ee us on board, left Crampley &s;hould know and detain him, when the time of our departure approached, I obtained leave to go and bid him farewell.&mdash;After we had vowed an everla&s;ting friend&s;hip, he pre&s;&s;ed upon me a pur&s;e with four double dubloons, which I refu&s;ed as long as I could, without giving umbrage; and having cordi|ally embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a &s;mall box, with a letter directed for me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins.&mdash;Knowing the &s;uper&s;cription to be of Thom&s;on's hand-writing, I opened it with &s;ome &s;urprize, and learned that this generous friend, not contented with loading me with the pre&s;ents already mentioned, had &s;ent for my u&s;e and acceptance, half a dozen fine &s;hirts, and as many linnen wai&s;tcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread-&s;tockings.&mdash;Being thus provided with money, and all nece&s;&s;a|ries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon my&s;elf as a gentleman of &s;ome con&s;equence, and felt my pride dilate apace.</P>

Next day we &s;ailed for Port-Royal, where we arrived &s;afely with our prizes; and as there was nothing to do on board, I went a&s;hore, and hav|ing purcha&s;ed a laced wai&s;tcoat, with &s;ome other cloaths at a vendue, made a &s;waggering figure for &s;ome days, among the taverns, where I ventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pi&s;toles in my pocket. Mean while our captain was promoted to a &s;hip of twenty guns, and the command of the Lizzard given to a man turned of four&s;core, who had been lieutenant &s;ince the reign of king William to this time, and notwith|&s;tanding his long &s;ervice, would have probably died in that &s;tation, had he not employed &s;ome prize-money he had lately received, to make intere&s;t with his &s;uperiors. My friend Brayl was al&s;o made an officer about the &s;ame time, after he had &s;erved in quality of mid&s;hipman and mate five and twenty years. Soon after the&s;e altera|tions, the admiral pitched upon our &s;hip to carry home di&s;patches for the mini&s;try; accordingly we &s;et &s;ail for England, having fir&s;t &s;crubbed her bottom, and taken in provi&s;ion and water for the occa&s;ion.</P>
