<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>MR. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy happened to meet la&s;t year at Weyhill-Fair. They were glad to &s;ee each other as they had but &s;eldom met of Jate; Mr. Bragwell having removed &s;ome years before from Mr. Worthy's neighbourhood, to a di&s;tant village where he had bought an e&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
Mr. Bragwell was a &s;ub&s;tantial Farmer and Grazier. He had ri&s;en in the world by what worldly men call a run of good fortune. He had al&s;o been a man of great indu&s;try; that is, he had paid a diligent and con&s;tant attention to his own intere&s;t. He under&s;tood bu&s;ine&s;s, and had a knack of turning almo&s;t every thing to his own advantage. He had that &s;ort of &s;en&s;e, which good men call cunning, and knaves call wi&s;dom. He was too prudent ever to do any thing &s;o wrong that the law could take hold of him; yet he was not over &s;crupulous about the morality of an action, when the pro&s;pect of enriching him|&s;elf by it was very great, and the chance of hurt|ing his character was &s;mall. The corn he &s;ent home to his cu&s;tomers was not always quite &s;o good as the &s;amples he had produced at market, and he now and then forgot to name &s;ome capital blemi&s;h in the hor&s;es he &s;old at fair. He &s;corned to be guilty of the petty frauds of cheating in weights and mea&s;ures, for he thought that was a beggarly &s;in; but he valued him&s;elf on his &s;kill in making a bargain, and fancied it &s;hewed his knowledge of the world to take advantage of the ignorance of a dealer.</P>
<P>It was his con&s;tant rule to undervalue every thing he was about to buy, and to overvalue every thing he was about to &s;ell; but as he prided him&s;elf on his character he avoided every thing that was very &s;hameful, &s;o that he was con&s;idered merely as a hard dealer, and a keen hand at a bargain. Now and then, when he had
<PB N="3" REF="5">
been caught in pu&s;hing his own advantage too far, he contrived to get out of the &s;crape by turning the whole into a je&s;t, &s;aying it was a good take in, a rare joke, and that he had only a mind to divert him&s;elf with the folly of his neighbour who could be &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell had one favourite maxim, namely, that a man's &s;ucce&s;s in life was a &s;ure proof of his wi&s;dom; and that all failure and misfortune was the con&s;equence of a man's own folly. As this opinion was fir&s;t taken up by him from vanity and ignorance; &s;o it was more and more confirmed by his own pro&s;perity. He &s;aw that he him&s;elf had &s;ucceeded greatly without either money or education to begin with, and he therefore now de&s;pi&s;ed every man, however excellent his character or talents might be, who had not had the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in life. His natural di&s;po&s;ition was not particularly bad, but pro|&s;perity had hardened his heart. He made his own progre&s;s in life the rule by which the con|duct of all other men was to be judged, without any allowance for their peculiar di&s;advantages, or the vi&s;itations of Providence. He thought, for his part, that every man of &s;en&s;e could command &s;ucce&s;s on his undertakings, and controul and di&s;po&s;e the events of his own life.</P>
<P>But though he con&s;idered tho&s;e who had le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than him&s;elf, as no better than fools, yet he did not extend this opinion to Mr. Worthy, whom he looked upon not only as a good but wi&s;e man. They had been bred up when chil|dren
<PB N="4" REF="6">
in the &s;ame hou&s;e, but with this difference, that Worthy was the nephew of the ma&s;ter, and Bragwell the &s;on of the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Bragwell's father had been ploughman in the family of Mr. Worthy's uncle, a &s;en&s;ible man, who farmed a &s;mall e&s;tate of his own, and who having no children, bred up young Worthy as his &s;on, in&s;tructed him in the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;|bandry, and at his death left him his e&s;tate. The father of Worthy was a pious clergyman who lived with his brother the farmer, in order to help out a narrow income. He had be&s;towed much pains on the in&s;truction of his &s;on, and u&s;ed fre|quently to repeat to him a &s;aying which he had picked up in a book written by one of the greate&s;t men in this country,&mdash;that there were two things with which every man ought to be acquainted, RELIGION AND HIS OWN BUSINESS. While he therefore took care that his &s;on &s;hould be made an excellent Farmer, he filled up his lei&s;ure hours in improving his mind; &s;o that young Worthy had read more good books and under&s;tood them better than mo&s;t men in his &s;tation. His read|ing however had been chiefly confined to hu&s;|bandry and divinity, the two &s;ubjects which were of the mo&s;t immediate importance to him.</P>
<P>The reader will &s;ee by this time that Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy were likely to be as oppo&s;ite to each other as two men could well be, who were nearly of the &s;ame age and condition, and who were neither of them without credit in the world. Bragwell indeed made far the greater
<PB N="5" REF="7">
figure, for he liked to <HI>cut a da&s;h,</HI> as he called it. And while it was the &s;tudy of Worthy to conform to his &s;tation, and to &s;et a good example to tho&s;e about him, it was the delight of Bragwell to vie in his way of life with men of larger fortune. He did not &s;ee how much this vanity rai&s;ed the envy of his inferiors, the ill-will of his equals, and the contempt of his betters.</P>
<P>His wife was a notable &s;tirring woman, but vain, violent, and ambitious; very ignorant, and very high-minded. She had married Bragwell before he was worth a &s;hilling, and as &s;he had brought him a good deal of money, &s;he thought her&s;elf the grand cau&s;e of his ri&s;ing in the world, and thence took occa&s;ion to govern him mo&s;t completely. Whenever he ventured to oppo&s;e her &s;he took care to put him in mind that he owed every thing to her, that had it not been for her he might &s;till have been &s;tumping after a plow-tail, or &s;erving hogs in old Worthy's farm|yard, but that it was &s;he who had made a gen|tleman of him. In order to &s;et about making him a gentleman &s;he had begun by teazing him till he had turned away all his poor relations who worked in the farm. She next drew him off from keeping company with his old acquaint|ance, and at lad per&s;uaded him to remove from the place where he had got his money. Poor woman! &s;he had not &s;en&s;e and virtue enough to &s;ee how honourable it is for a man to rai&s;e him|&s;elf in the world by fair means, and then to help forward his poor relations and friends; engaging
<PB N="6" REF="8">
their &s;ervices by his kindne&s;s, and endeavouring to keep want out of the family.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell was an excellent mi&s;tre&s;s, ac|cording to her own notions of excellence, for no one could &s;ay that &s;he ever lo&s;t an opportunity of &s;colding a &s;ervant, or was ever guilty of the weak|ne&s;s of overlooking a fault. Towards her two daughters her behaviour was far otherwi&s;e. In them &s;he could &s;ee nothing but perfections; but her extravagant fondne&s;s for the&s;e girls was full as much owing to pride as to affection. She was bent on making a family, and having found out that &s;he was too ignorant, and too much trained to the habits of getting money, ever to hope to make a figure her&s;elf, &s;he looked to her daughters as the per&s;ons who were to rai&s;e the family of Bragwells; and in this hope &s;he fooli&s;hly &s;ub|mitted to any drudgery for their &s;akes, and bore every kind of impertinence from them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart was to &s;et them above their neighbours; for &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, what was the u&s;e of having &s;ub&s;tance, if her daughters might not carry them&s;elves above girls who had nothing? To do her ju&s;tice, &s;he her&s;elf would be about early and late to &s;ee that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e was not neglected. She had been bred to great indu&s;try, and continued to work when it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary, both from early habit, and the de&s;ire of heaping up money for her daughters. Yet her whole notion of gentility was, that it con&s;i&s;ted in being rich and idle; and though &s;he was willing to be a drudge her&s;elf, &s;he
<PB N="7" REF="9">
re&s;olved to make her daughters gentlewomen on this principle. To be well dre&s;&s;ed and to do nothing, or nothing which is of any u&s;e, was what &s;he fancied di&s;tingui&s;hed people in genteel life. And this is too common a notion of a fine education among &s;ome people. They do not e&s;teem things by their u&s;e, but by their &s;hew. They e&s;timate the value of their children's edu|cation by the money it co&s;ts, and not by the knowledge and goodne&s;s it be&s;tows. People of this &s;tamp often take a pride in the expence of learning, in&s;tead of taking plea&s;ure in the ad|vantages of it. And the &s;illy vanity of letting others &s;ee that they can afford any thing, often &s;ets parents on letting their daughters learn not only things of no u&s;e, but things which may be really hurtful in their &s;ituation; either by &s;etting them above their proper duties, or by taking up their time in a way incon&s;i&s;tent with them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell &s;ent her daughters to a boarding &s;chool, where &s;he in&s;tructed them to hold up their heads as high as any body; to have more &s;pirit than <HI>to be put upon</HI> by any one; never to be pitiful about money, but rather to &s;hew that they could &s;pend with the be&s;t; to keep company with the riche&s;t girls in the &s;chool, and to make no acquaintance with Farmers Daughters.</P>
<P>They came home at the u&s;ual age of leaving &s;chool, with a large portion of vanity grafted on their native ignorance. The vanity was added, but the ignorance was not taken away. Of Re|ligion they could not po&s;&s;ibly learn any thing,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
&s;ince none was taught, for at that place it was con&s;idered as a part of education which belonged only to Charity Schools. Of knowledge they got ju&s;t enough to laugh at their fond parents ru&s;tic manners and vulgar language, and ju&s;t enough ta&s;te to de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule every girl who was not as vainly dre&s;&s;ed as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The mother had been comforting her&s;elf for the heavy expence of their bringing up, by look|ing forward to the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them be|came fine ladies, and to the pride of marrying them above their &s;tation.</P>
<P>Their father hoped al&s;o that they would be a comfort to him both in &s;ickne&s;s and in health. He had had no learning him&s;elf, and could write but poorly, and owed what &s;kill he had in figures to his natural turn for bu&s;ine&s;s. He hoped that his daughters, after all the money he had &s;pent on them, would now write his letters and keep his accounts. And as he was now and then laid up with a fit of the gout, he was enjoy|ing the pro&s;pect of having two affectionate chil|dren to nur&s;e him.</P>
<P>When they came home, however, he had the mortification to find, that though he had two &s;mart &s;howy ladies to vi&s;it him, he had neither dutiful daughters to nur&s;e him, nor faithful &s;tew|ards to keep his books, nor prudent children to manage his hou&s;e. They neither &s;oothed him by kindne&s;s when he was &s;ick, nor helped him when he was bu&s;y. They thought the maid might take care of him in the gout as &s;he did
<PB N="9" REF="11">
before. And as to their &s;kill in cyphering he &s;oon found, to his co&s;t, that though they knew how to <HI>&s;pend</HI> both Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, yet they did not know &s;o well how to ca&s;t them up.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell one day being very bu&s;y in pre|paring a great dinner for the neighbours, ven|tured to reque&s;t her daughters to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making the pa&s;try. They a&s;ked her &s;cornfully, whether &s;he had &s;ent them to Boarding School to learn to cook; and added, that they &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would expect them next to make puddings for the hay|makers. So &s;aying they coolly marched off to their mu&s;ic. When the mother found her girls were too polite to be of any u&s;e, &s;he would take comfort in ob&s;erving how her parlour was &s;et out with their Fillagree and Flowers, their Embroi|dery and Cut paper. They &s;pent the morning in bed, the noon in dre&s;&s;ing, the evening at the Spinnet, and the night in reading Novels.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e fine qualifications it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that as they de&s;pi&s;ed their &s;ober duties, they no le&s;s de&s;pi&s;ed their plain neighbours. When they could not get to a hor&s;e race, a petty ball, or a &s;trolling play, with &s;ome company as idle and as &s;mart as them&s;elves, they were driven for amu&s;ement to the Circulating-Library. Jack, the plow-boy, on whom they had now put a livery jacket, was employed half his time in trotting backwards and forwards with the mo&s;t wretched tra&s;h the little neighbouring book &s;hop could furni&s;h. The choice was often left to Jack,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
who could not read, but who had general orders to bring all the new things, and a great many of them.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;tate, or rather growing world, for idlene&s;s and vanity are never at a &s;tand; when the&s;e two wealthy farmers, Brag|well and Worthy, met at Weyhill Fare, as was &s;aid before. After many hearty &s;alutations had pa&s;&s;ed between them, it was agreed that Mr. Bragwell &s;hould &s;pend the next day with his old friend, who&s;e hou&s;e was not many miles di&s;tant. Bragwell invited him&s;elf in the following man|ner: &mdash;We have not had a comfortable day's chat for years, &s;aid he, and as I am to look at a drove of lean bea&s;ts in your neighbourhood, I will take a bed at your hou&s;e, and we will pa&s;s the evening in debating as we u&s;ed to do. You know I al|ways loved a bit of an argument, and am reck|oned not to make the wor&s;t figure at our club: I had not, to be &s;ure, &s;uch good learning as you had, becau&s;e your father was a par&s;on, and you got it for nothing; but I can bear my part pretty well for all that. When any man talks to me about his learning, I a&s;k if it has helped him to get a good e&s;tate; if he &s;ays no, then I would not give him a ru&s;h for it; for of what u&s;e is all the learning in the world if it does not make a man rich? But as I was &s;aying, I will come and &s;ee you to-morrow; but now don't let your wife put her&s;elf into a fu&s;s for me. Don't alter your own plain way, for I am not proud I
<PB N="11" REF="13">
a&s;&s;ure you, nor above my old friends, though I thank GOD I am pretty well in the world.</P>
<P>To all this flouri&s;hing &s;peech Mr. Worthy coolly an&s;wered, that certainly worldly pro&s;perity ought never to make any man proud, &s;ince it is GOD who giveth &s;trength to get riches, and with|out his ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>'tis in vain to ri&s;e up early and to eat the bread of carefulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>About the middle of the next day Mr. Brag|well reached Mr. Worthy's neat and plea&s;ant dwelling. He found every thing in it the re|ver&s;e of his own. It had not &s;o many ornaments, but it had more comforts. And when he &s;aw his friend's good old fa&s;hioned arm chair in a warm corner, he gave a &s;igh to think how his own had been bani&s;hed to make room for his daughter's Piano Forte. In&s;tead of made flowers in gla&s;s ca&s;es, and a tea che&s;t and &s;creen too fine to be u&s;ed, which he &s;aw at home, and about which he was cautioned, and &s;colded as often as he came near them, he &s;aw a neat &s;helf of good books for the &s;ervice of the family, and a &s;mall medicine che&s;t for the benefit of the poor.</P>
<P>Mrs. Worthy and her daughters had prepared a plain but neat and good dinner. The tarts were &s;o excellent that Bragwell felt a &s;ecret kind of regret that his own daughters were too genteel to do any thing &s;o very u&s;eful. Indeed he had been always unwilling to believe that any thing which was very proper and very nece&s;&s;ary, could be &s;o extremely vulgar and unbecoming as his daughters were always declaring it to be. And
<PB N="12" REF="14">
his late experience of the little comfort he found at home, inclined him now &s;till more &s;trongly to &s;u&s;pect that things were not &s;o right as he had been made to &s;uppo&s;e. But it was in vain to &s;peak; for his daughters con&s;tantly &s;topped his mouth by a favourite &s;aying of theirs, better be out of the world than out of the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Soon after dinner the women went out to their &s;everal employments, and Mr. Worthy being left alone with his gue&s;t the following di&s;cour&s;e took place.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a couple of &s;ober pretty looking girls, Worthy; but I wonder they don't tiff off a little more. Why my girls have as much fat and flour on their heads as would half maintain my reapers in &s;uet pudding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bragwell, in the management of my family, I don't con&s;ider what I might afford only, though that is one great point; but I con&s;ider al&s;o what is needful and becoming in a man of my &s;tation, for there are &s;o many u&s;eful ways of laying out money, that I feel as if it were a &s;in to &s;pend one unnece&s;&s;ary &s;hilling. Having had the ble&s;&s;ing of a good education my&s;elf, I have been able to give the like advantage to my daughters. One of the be&s;t le&s;&s;ons I have taught them is, to know them&s;elves; and one proof that they have learnt this le&s;&s;on is, that they are not above any of the duties of their &s;tation. They read and write well, and when my eyes are bad, they keep my accounts in a very pretty manner. If I had put them to learn what you call <HI>genteel</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="15">
<HI>things,</HI> the&s;e might either have been of no u&s;e to them, and &s;o both time and money might have been thrown away; or they might have proved wor&s;e than nothing to them by leading them into wrong notions, and wrong company. Though we don't wi&s;h them to do the laborious parts of the dairy work; yet they always a&s;&s;i&s;t their mother in the management of it. As to their appearance, they are every day nearly as you &s;ee them now, and on Sundays they are very neatly dre&s;&s;ed, but it is always in a decent and mode&s;t way. There are no lappets, fringes, furbelows, and tawdry ornaments, fluttering about among my chee&s;e and butter. And I &s;hould feel no vanity but much mortification if a &s;tranger &s;eeing Farmer Worthy's daughters at Church, &s;hould a&s;k who tho&s;e fine ladies were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I own I &s;hould like to have &s;uch a que&s;tion a&s;ked concerning my daughters. I like to make people &s;tare and envy. It makes one feel one-&s;elf &s;omebody. But as to your&s;elf, to be &s;ure you be&s;t know what you can afford. And indeed there is &s;ome difference between your daughters and the Mi&s;s Bragwells.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, before I engage in any expence, I always a&s;k my&s;elf the&s;e two &s;hort que&s;tions, Fir&s;t, Can I afford it?&mdash;Secondly, Is it proper for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you &s;o? Now I own I a&s;k my&s;elf but one. For if I find I can afford it, I take care to make it proper for me. If I can pay
<PB N="14" REF="16">
for a thing, no one has a right to hinder me from having it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. But a man's own pru|dence and &s;en&s;e of duty, ought to prevent him from doing an improper thing, as effectually as if there were &s;omebody to hinder him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I think a man is a fool who is hindered from having any thing he has a mind to; unle&s;s, indeed, he is in want of money to pay for it; I'm no friend to debt. A poor man mu&s;t want on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope my children have learnt not to want any thing which is not proper for them. They are very indu&s;trious, they attend to bu&s;ine&s;s all day; and in the evening they &s;it down to their work and a good book. I think they live in the fear of GOD. I tru&s;t they are humble and pious, and I am &s;ure they &s;eem cheerful and happy. If I am &s;ick, it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee them di&s;pute which &s;hall wait upon me, for they &s;ay the maid cannot do it &s;o tenderly as them&s;elves.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>This part of the di&s;cour&s;e &s;taggered Bragwell. Vain as he was, he could not help feeling what a difference a religious and a worldly education made on the heart, and how much the former regulated even the natural temper. Another thing which &s;urpri&s;ed him was, that the&s;e girls, living a life of dome&s;tic piety, without any public diver&s;ions, &s;hould be &s;o very cheerful and happy; while his own daughters who were never contradicted, and were indulged with con|tinual
<PB N="15" REF="17">
amu&s;ements, were always &s;ullen and ill-tempered. That they who are more humoured &s;hould be le&s;s grateful and le&s;s happy, di&s;turbed him much. He envied Worthy the tenderne&s;s of his children, though he would not own it, but turned it off thus.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my girls are too &s;mart to make mopes of, that is the truth. Though ours is &s;uch a lonely village, 'tis wonderful to &s;ee how &s;oon they get the fa&s;hions. What with the de|&s;criptions in the Magazines, and the pictures in the Pocket Books, they have them in a twinkling, and out-do their patterns all to nothing. I u&s;ed to take in the County Journal, becau&s;e it was u&s;eful enough to &s;ee how Oats went, the time of high water, and the price of Stocks. But when my ladies came home for&s;ooth, I was &s;oon wheedled out of that, and forced to take a Lon|don paper, that tells a deal about caps and fea|thers, and all the trumpery of the quality. When I want to know what Hops are a bag, they are &s;natching the paper to &s;ee what violet &s;oap is a pound. And as to the dairy, they never care how Cow's milk goes, as long as they can get &s;ome &s;tuff which they call Milk of Ro&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do your daughters never read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read! I believe they do too. Why our Jack, the Plow-boy, &s;pends half his time in going to a &s;hop in our Market town, where they let out books to read with marble covers. And they &s;ell paper with all manner of colours on the edges, and gim-cracks, and powder-puffs, and
<PB N="16" REF="18">
wa&s;h-balls, and cards without any pips, and every thing in the world that's genteel and of no u&s;e. 'Twas but t'other day I met Jack with a ba&s;ket full of the&s;e books, &s;o having &s;ome time to &s;pare, I &s;at down to &s;ee a little what they were about.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O as to that, you are pretty much out. I could make neither head nor tail of it. It was neither fi&s;h, fle&s;h, nor good red-herring. It was all about my Lord, and Sir Harry, and the Captain. But I never met with &s;uch non-&s;en&s;ical fellows in my life. Their talk was no more like that of my old landlord, who was a Lord you know, nor the Captain of our fen|cibles, than chalk is like chee&s;e. I was fairly taken in at fir&s;t, and began to think I had got hold of a <HI>godly</HI> book, for there was a deal about hope and de&s;pair, and heaven, and Angels, and torments, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s. But when I got a little on, I found there was no meaning in all the&s;e words, or, if any, 'twas a bad meaning. Mi&s;ery perhaps only meant a di&s;appointment about a bit of a letter: and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s meant two people talking non|&s;en&s;e together for five minutes. In &s;hort, I never met with &s;uch a pack of lies. The people talk &s;uch gibberi&s;h as no folks in their &s;ober &s;en&s;es ever did talk; and the things that happen to them are not like the things that ever happen to
<PB N="17" REF="19">
any of my acquaintance. They are at home one minute, and beyond &s;ea the next. Beggars to|day, and Lords to-morrow. Waiting maids in the morning, and Duche&s;&s;es at night. You and I, Ma&s;ter Worthy, have worked hard many years, and think it very well to have &s;craped a trifle of money together, you a few hundreds, I &s;uppo&s;e, and I a few thou&s;ands. But one would think every man in the&s;e books had the Bank of England in his &s;crutoire. Then there's ano|ther thing which I never met with in true life. We think it pretty well, you know, if one has got one thing, and another has got another. I'll tell you how I mean. You are reckoned &s;en&s;ible, our Par&s;on is learned, the Squire is rich, I am rather generous, one of your daugh|ters is pretty, and both mine are genteel. But in the&s;e books, (except here and there one, whom they make wor&s;e than Satan him&s;elf) every man and woman's child of them, are all wi&s;e, and witty, and generous, and rich, and hand&s;ome, and genteel; and all to the la&s;t de|gree. Nobody is middling, or good in one thing, and bad in another, like my live acquaint|ance; but 'tis all up to the &s;kies, or down to the dirt. I had rather read Tom Hickathrift, or Jack the Giant Killer, a thou&s;and times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have found out, Mr. Bragwell, that many of the&s;e books are ridiculous; I will go farther, and &s;ay, that to me they appear wicked al&s;o. And I &s;hould account the reading of them a great mi&s;chief, e&s;pecially to people in
<PB N="18" REF="20">
middling and low life, if I only took into the account the great lo&s;s of time &s;uch reading cau&s;es, and the aver&s;ion it leaves behind for what is more &s;erious and &s;olid. But this, though a bad part, is not the wor&s;t. The&s;e books give fal&s;e views of human life. They teach a contempt for humble and dome&s;tic duties; for indu&s;try, frugality, and retirement. Want of youth and beauty, is con&s;idered in them as ridiculous. Plain people, like you and me, are objects of contempt. Parental authority is &s;et at nought. Nay, plots and contrivances again&s;t parents, and guardians, fill half the volumes. They con&s;ider love as the great bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and even teach that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be regulated or re&s;trained, and to the indulgence of this pa&s;&s;ion every duty is therefore &s;acrificed A country life, with a kind mother, or a &s;ober aunt, is de&s;cribed as a &s;tate of intolerable mi&s;ery. And one would be apt to fancy, from their painting, that a good country hou&s;e is a pri&s;on, and a worthy father the gaoler. Vice is &s;et off with every ornament which can make it plea&s;ing and amiable; while virtue and piety are made ridi|culous by tacking to them &s;omething that is &s;illy, or ab&s;urd. Crimes, which would be con&s;idered as hanging matter at the Old Bailey, are here made to take the appearance of virtue, by being mixed with &s;ome wild flight of unnatural genero&s;ity. Tho&s;e crying &s;ins, ADULTERY, GAMING, DUELS, and SELF-MURDER, are made &s;o familiar, and the wickedne&s;s of them is
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, that even innocent girls get to lo&s;e their abhorrence, and to talk with complacency of <HI>things which &s;hould not be &s;o much as named by them.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much on this mi&s;|chief (continued Mr. Worthy,) from which I dare &s;ay, great folks fancy people in our &s;tation are &s;afe enough, if I did not know, and lament that this corrupt reading is now got down even among &s;ome of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s. And it is an evil which is &s;preading every day. Poor indu&s;|trious girls, who get their bread by the needle, or the loom, &s;pend half the night in li&s;tening to the&s;e books. Thus the labour of one girl is lo&s;t, and the minds of the re&s;t are corrupted; for though their hands are employed in hone&s;t in|du&s;try, which might help to pre&s;erve them from a life of &s;in, yet their hearts are at that very time polluted by &s;cenes and de&s;criptions which are too likely to plunge them into it. And I think I don't go too far, when I &s;ay, that the vain and &s;hewy manner in which young women who have to work for their bread, have taken to dre&s;s them&s;elves, added to the poi&s;on they draw from the&s;e books, contribute together to bring them to de&s;truction, more than almo&s;t any other cau&s;e. Now tell me, don't you think the&s;e vile books will hurt your daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I do think they are grown full of &s;chemes and contrivances and whi&s;pers, that's the truth on't. Every thing is a &s;ecret. They always &s;eem to be on the look-out for
<PB N="20" REF="22">
&s;omething, and when nothing comes on't, then they are &s;ulky and di&s;appointed. They will not keep company with their equals. They de&s;pi&s;e trade and farming, and I own, <HI>I'm for the &s;tuff.</HI> I &s;hould not like for them to marry any, but a man of &s;ub&s;tance, if he was ever &s;o &s;mart. Now they will hardly fit down with a &s;ub&s;tantial country dealer. But if they hear of a recruiting party in our Market Town, on goes the finery&mdash;off they are. Some flim&s;y excu&s;e is patched up. They want &s;omething at the book &s;hop, or the milli|ner's, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e there is a chance that &s;ome Jack-a-napes of an En&s;ign may be there buying &s;ticking-plai&s;ter. In &s;hort I do grow a little unea&s;y, for I &s;hould not like to &s;ee all I have &s;aved thrown away on a knap&s;ack.</P>
</SP>
<P>So &s;aying they both ro&s;e, and walked out to view the farm. Mr. Bragwell affected greatly to admire the good order of every thing he &s;aw; but never forgot to compare it with &s;omething larger and hand&s;omer or better of his own. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that <HI>&s;elf</HI> was his &s;tandard of per|fection in every thing. All he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed gained &s;ome increa&s;ed value in his eyes from being his; and in &s;urveying the property of his friend, he derived food for his vanity, from things which &s;eemed lea&s;t likely to rai&s;e it. Every appear|ance of comfort, of &s;ucce&s;s, of merit, in any thing which belonged to Mr. Worthy, led him to &s;peak of &s;ome &s;uperior advantage of his own, of the &s;ame kind. And it was clear that the chief part of the &s;atisfaction he felt in walking over the farm
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of his friend, was cau&s;ed by thinking how much larger his own was.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy who felt a kindne&s;s for him, which all his vanity could not cure, was on the watch how to turn their talk to &s;ome u&s;eful point. And whenever people re&s;olve to go into company with this view, it is commonly their own fault if &s;ome opportunity of turning it to account does not offer.</P>
<P>He &s;aw Bragwell was intoxicated with pride, and undone by pro&s;perity, and that his family was in the high-road to ruin. He thought that if &s;ome means could be found to open his eyes on his own character, to which he was now totally blind, it might be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to him. The more Mr. Worthy reflected, the more he wi&s;hed to undertake this kind office. He was not &s;ure that Mr. Bragwell would bear it, but he was very &s;ure it was his duty to attempt it. Mr. Worthy was very humble, and very candid, and he had great patience and forbearance with the faults of others. He felt no pride at having e&s;caped the &s;ame errors him&s;elf, for he knew who it was had <HI>made them to differ.</HI> He remembered that God had given him many advantages, a pious father, and a religious education; this made him humble under a &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ins, and charitable towards the &s;ins of others, who had not the &s;ame privileges.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was going to try to enter into a very &s;erious conver&s;ation with his gue&s;t, he was &s;top|ped by the appearance of his daughter, who told
<PB N="22" REF="24">
them &s;upper was ready.&mdash;This interruption obliges me to break off al&s;o, and I &s;hall re&s;erve what follows to the next month, when I promi&s;e to give my readers the &s;econd part of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>MY readers may remember that the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory concluded with a walk taken by Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy over the grounds of the latter, in which walk Mr. Bragwell, though he &s;eemed to admire, took care to lower every thing he &s;aw, by comparing it with &s;ome|thing better which he had of his own. Soon after &s;upper Mrs. Worthy left the room with her daughters, at her hu&s;band's de&s;ire; for it was his intention to &s;peak more plainly to Bragwell than was likely to be agreeable to him to hear before others.</P>
<P>The two farmers being &s;eated at their little table, each in a hand&s;ome old-fa&s;hioned great chair, Bragwell began.</P>
<P>It is a great comfort, neighbour Worthy, at a certain time of life, to be got above the world; my notion is, that a man &s;hould labour hard the fir&s;t part of his days, and that he may then &s;it down and enjoy him&s;elf for the remainder. Now though I hate boa&s;ting, yet as you are my olde&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="25">
friend I am about to open my heart to you. Let me tell you then I reckon I have worked as hard as any man in my time, and that I now begin to think I have a right to indulge a little. I have got my money with a good character, and I mean to &s;pend it with credit. I pay every one his own, I &s;et a good example, I keep to my church, I &s;erve God, I honour the king, and I obey the laws of the land.</P>
<P>This is doing a great deal indeed, replied Mr. Worthy; but, added he, I doubt that more goes to the making up all the&s;e duties than men are commonly aware of. Suppo&s;e then that you and I talk the matter over coolly, we have the evening before us. What if we &s;it down together as two friends, and examine one another.</P>
<P>Bragwell, who loved argument, and who was not a little vain both of his &s;en&s;e and his mora|lity, accepted the challenge, and gave his word that he would take in good part any thing that &s;hould be &s;aid to him. Worthy was about to proceed when Bragwell interrupted him for a moment, by &s;aying,&mdash;But &s;top, friend, before we begin I wi&s;h you would remember that we have had a long walk, and I want a little re|fre&s;hment; have you no liquor that is &s;tronger than this cyder? I am afraid it will give me a &s;it of the gout.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy immediately produced a bottle of wine, and another of &s;pirits, &s;aying, that though he drank neither &s;pirits nor even wine

<P>Hark ye Mr. Bragwell, he that deals in &s;muggled brandy, is the man who takes to him&s;elf the king's money in its way to the trea|&s;ury, and he as much robs the government as if he dipt his hands into a bag of guineas in the trea&s;ury chamber.

<P>To be &s;ure I do. I dare &s;ay I do: look'ee Mr. Worthy, I don't pretend to much reading, I was not bred to it as you were.

<P>Sermon on the mount! why the ten commandments are in the 20th chapter of Exodus.

<P>What! do you think that I &s;erve two Gods? Do you think then that I make graven images, and wor&s;hip &s;tocks or &s;tones? Do you take me for a Papi&s;t or an Idolator?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't triumph quite &s;o &s;oon, ma&s;ter Bragwell. Pray is there nothing in the world you prefer to God, and thus make an idol of? Do you not love your money, or your lands, or your crops, or your cattle, or your own will, and your own way, rather better than you love God? Do you never think of the&s;e with more plea&s;ure than you think of Him, and follow them more eagerly than your religious duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O there's nothing about that in the 20th Chapter of Exodus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Je&s;us Chri&s;t has &s;aid, "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." Now it is certainly a man's duty to love his father and mother, nay it would be wicked not to love them, and yet we mu&s;t not love even the&s;e more than our Creator and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
our Saviour. Well I think on this principle your heart pleads guilty to the breach of the fir&s;t and &s;econd commandments, let us proceed to the third.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is about &s;wearing, is it not? Mr. Worthy, who had ob&s;erved Bragwell guilty of much profanene&s;s in u&s;ing the name of his Maker, (though all &s;uch offen&s;ive words have been avoided in writing this hi&s;tory) now told him that he had been waiting the whole day for an opportunity to reprove him for his frequent breach of the third commandment.</P>
<P>Good L&mdash;d, I break the third command|ment, &s;aid Bragwell, no indeed hardly ever. I once u&s;ed to &s;wear a little to be &s;ure, but I vow to G&mdash;d I never do it now, except now and then, when I happen to be in a pa&s;&s;ion: and in &s;uch a ca&s;e, why good G&mdash;d you know the &s;in is with tho&s;e who provoke me, and not with me; but upon my &s;oul I don't think I have &s;worn an oath the&s;e three months, no not I faith, as I hope to be &s;aved.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bragwell, this is the way in which many who call them&s;elves very good &s;ort of people deceive them&s;elves. What! is it no

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I m'u&s;t take a little more care I believe: I vow to heaven I did not know there had been &s;o much harm in it; but my daughters &s;eldom &s;peak without u&s;ing &s;ome of the&s;e words, and yet they wanted to make me believe the other day that it is mon&s;trous vulgar to &s;wear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Women, even gentlewomen, who ought to correct this evil habit in their fathers, and hu&s;bands, and children, are too apt to en|courage it by their own practice. And indeed they betray the profanene&s;s of their own minds al&s;o by it, for none, who truly venerate the holy name of God, can either profane it in this manner them&s;elves, or hear others do &s;o without being exceedingly pained at it.</P>

&s;ince I go to church every Sunday of my life, unle&s;s on &s;ome very extraordinary occa&s;ion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>For tho&s;e occa&s;ions the go&s;pel allows, by &s;aying, "the &s;abbath was made for man and not man for the &s;abbath." Our own &s;ickne&s;s, or attending on the &s;ickne&s;s of others, are lawful impediments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I am now and then obliged to look at a drove of bea&s;ts, or to go a journey, or to take &s;ome medicine, or perhaps &s;ome friend may call upon me, or it may be very cold, or very hot, or very rainy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor excu&s;es, Mr. Bragwell; I am afraid the&s;e will not pa&s;s on the day of judgment. But how is the re&s;t of your Sunday &s;pent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O why, I a&s;&s;ure you, I often go to church in the afternoon al&s;o, and even if I am ever &s;o &s;leepy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you fini&s;h your nap at church, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as to that, to be &s;ure we do contrive to have &s;omething a little nicer than common for dinner on a Sunday; in con&s;equence of which one eats, you know, a little more than ordinary; and having nothing to do on that day, one has more lei&s;ure to take a chearful gla&s;s; and all the&s;e things will make one a little heavy you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you take a little ride in the morning, and look at your &s;heep when the weather is good, and &s;o fill your mind ju&s;t before you go to church with thoughts of them; and
<PB N="31" REF="33">
when you come away again don't you &s;ettle an account, or write a few letters of bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay but I do, but that is nothing to any body, as long as I &s;et a good example by keeping to my church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you pa&s;s your Sunday evenings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife and daughters go a vi&s;it|ing of a Sunday afternoon. My daughters are glad to get out at any rate, and as to my wife, &s;he &s;ays, that being ready dre&s;&s;ed it is a pity to lo&s;e the opportunity, be&s;ides it &s;aves her time on a week day; &s;o then you &s;ee I have it all my own way, and when I have got rid of the ladies, who are ready to faint at the &s;mell of tobacco, I can venture to &s;moak a pipe, and drink a &s;ober gla&s;s of punch with half a dozen friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which punch being made of &s;mug|gled brandy, and drank on the Lord's day, in very vain, as well as profane and worldly com|pany, you are enabled to break both the law of God, and that of your country at a &s;troke: and I &s;uppo&s;e when you are got together, you &s;peak of your cattle, or of your crops, after which per|haps you talk over a few of your neighbours' faults, and then you brag a little of your own wealth, or your own achievements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you &s;eem to know us &s;o well, that any one would think you had been &s;itting behind the curtain, and yet you are a little mi&s;|taken too, for I think we have hardly &s;aid a word
<PB N="32" REF="34">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you find that you much improve your Chri&s;tian charity by that &s;ubject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be &s;ure we do quarrel 'till we are very near fighting, that is the wor&s;t on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then you call names, and &s;wear a little I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why when one is contradicted and put in a pa&s;&s;ion you know, fle&s;h and blood can't bear it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when all your friends are gone home, what becomes of the re&s;t of the evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is ju&s;t as it happens, &s;ome|times I read the new&s;paper; and as one is gene|rally mo&s;t tired on the days one does nothing, I go to bed earlier than on other days, that I may be more fit to get up to my bu&s;ine&s;s the next morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you &s;horten Sunday as much as you can, by cutting off a bit at both ends, I &s;up|po&s;e; for I take it for granted, you lie a little later in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come. We &s;han't get through the whole ten to-night if you &s;tand &s;nubbing one at this rate. You may pa&s;s over the fifth, for my father and mother have been dead &s;ince I was a boy, &s;o I am clear of that &s;crape.</P>

<P>There are, however, many relative duties in that commandment; unkindne&s;s to all kindred is forbidden.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, if you mean my turning off my nephew Tom, the plowboy, you mu&s;t not blame me for that, it was all my wife's fault. He was as good a lad as ever lived to be &s;ure, and my own brother's &s;on, but my wife could not bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at a boy in a carter's frock &s;hould be about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e hou&s;e, calling her aunt.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which was a fre&s;h breach of the commandment; a worthy nephew turned out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oors, and a wife not &s;poken to for a week, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e no very convincing proofs of your ob&s;ervance of the fifth commandment.</P>

<P>What kill any body?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the laws of the land indeed, and the di&s;grace attending it, are almo&s;t enough to keep any man from actual murder; let me a&s;k, however, do you never give way to unju&s;t anger, and pa&s;&s;ion, and revenge? as for in&s;tance, do you never feel your re&s;entment kindle again&s;t &s;ome of the politicians who contradict you on a Sunday night? and do you never pu&s;h your animo&s;ity again&s;t &s;omebody that has affronted you, further than the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! only bear in mind that you wilfully break this commandment, whether you abu&s;e your &s;ervant, are angry at your wife, watch for a moment to revenge an injury on your neighbour, or even wreak your pa&s;&s;ion on a harmle&s;s bea&s;t; for you have then the &s;eeds of murder working in your brea&s;t; and if there were no law, no gibbet to check you, and no fear of di&s;grace neither, I am not &s;ure where you would &s;top.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Worthy, you have a &s;trange way of explaining the commandments, &s;o you &s;et me down for a murderer, merely be|cau&s;e I bear hatred to a man who has done me a hurt, and am glad to do him a like injury in my turn.&mdash;I am &s;ure I &s;hould want &s;pirit if I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go by the &s;cripture rule, which &s;ays, "he that hateth his brother is a murderer," and again, "love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you." Be&s;ides, Mr. Brag|well, you made it a part of your boa&s;t that you &s;aid the Lord's Prayer every day, wherein you pray to God to forgive you your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es as you forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t you.&mdash;If therefore you do not forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t you, in that ca&s;e, you pray daily that your own tre&s;pa&s;&s;es may never be forgiven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, come let us make ha&s;te and get through the&s;e commandments. The next is, "Thou &s;halt not commit adultery," thank God neither I nor my family can be &s;aid to break the &s;eventh commandment.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="37">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here again, remember how Chri&s;t him&s;elf hath &s;aid, "who&s;o looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath already committed adul|tery with her in his heart." The&s;e are no far|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etched expre&s;&s;ions of mine, Mr. Bragwell, they are the words of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I hope you will not charge him with having carried things too far, for if you do, you charge him with being mi&s;taken in the religion he taught, and this can only be accounted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing him an im|po&s;tor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, upon my word, Mr. Wor|thy, I don't like the&s;e &s;ayings of his, which you quote upon me &s;o often, and that is the truth of it, and I can't &s;ay I feel much di&s;po&s;ed to believe them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I hope you believe that creed of yours, which you al&s;o boa&s;ted of your repeating &s;o regularly.</P>

<P>Well, well. I'll believe any thing you &s;ay rather than &s;tand quarrelling with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope then, you will allow, that &s;ince it is committing adultery to look at a wo|man with even an irregular thought, it follows from the &s;ame rule, that all immode&s;t dre&s;s in your daughters, or indecent je&s;ts and double meanings in your&s;elf; all loo&s;e &s;ongs or novels; and all diver&s;ions al&s;o which have a like dan|gerous tendency, are forbidden by the &s;eventh commandment; for it is mo&s;t plain from what Chri&s;t has &s;aid, that it takes in not only the act but the inclination, the de&s;ire, the indulged

imagination; the act is only the la&s;t and highe&s;t degree of any &s;in, the topmo&s;t round as it were of a ladder, to which all the lower rounds are only as &s;o many &s;teps and &s;tages.</P>

<P>Strict indeed, Mr. Worthy, but let us go on to the next; you won't pretend to &s;ay <HI>I &s;teal.</HI> Mr. Bragwell, I tru&s;t, was never known to rob on the highway, to break open his neighbour's hou&s;e, or to u&s;e fal&s;e weights or mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>No, nor have you ever been under any temptation to do it, and yet there are a thou&s;and ways of breaking the eighth command|ment be&s;ides actual &s;tealing; for in&s;tance, do you never hide the faults of the goods you fell, and heighten the faults of tho&s;e you buy? Do you never take advantage of an ignorant dealer, and a&s;k more for a thing than it is worth? Do you never turn the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of a man, who has &s;omething to &s;ell, to your own unfair benefit, and thus act as unju&s;tly by him as if you had &s;tolen? Do you never cut off a &s;hilling from a workman's wages, under a pretence which your con&s;cience can't ju&s;tify? Do you never pa&s;s off an un&s;ound hor&s;e, for a &s;ound one? Do you never conceal the real rent of your e&s;tate from the over&s;eers, and thereby rob the poor-rates of their legal due?</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! the&s;e things are done every day. I &s;han't go to &s;et up for being better than my neighbours in the&s;e &s;ort of things; the&s;e little matters will pa&s;s mu&s;ter.&mdash;I don't &s;et up for a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t be tried hereafter at the bar of God, and not by a jury of your fellow-creatures; and the &s;criptures are given us, in order to &s;hew by what rule we &s;hall be judged. How many or how &s;ew do as you do, is quite a&s;ide from the que&s;tion; Je&s;us Chri&s;t has even told us to &s;trive to enter in at the <HI>&s;trait</HI> gate, &s;o that we ought rather to take fright, from our being like the common run of people, than to take comfort from our being &s;o.</P>

<P>You mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, you would not &s;wear a man's life away fal&s;ely before a ma|gi&s;trate, but do you take equal care not to &s;lan|der or backbite him? Do you never repre&s;ent a good action of a man you have quarrelled with as if it were a bad one? or do you never make a bad one wor&s;e than it is, by your manner of telling it? even when you invent no fal&s;e cir|cum&s;tance,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
do you never give &s;uch a colour, to tho&s;e you relate, as to leave a fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the hearers? Do you never twi&s;t a &s;tory &s;o as to make it tell a little better for your|&s;elf, and a little wor&s;e for your neighbour, than truth and ju&s;tice warrant?</P>

<P>Aye, much too natural to be right, I doubt. Well, now we are got to the la&s;t of the commandments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have run the gauntlet finely through them all; you will bring me in guilty here I &s;uppo&s;e, for the plea&s;ure of going through with it, for you condemn without judge or jury, ma&s;ter Worthy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The culprit, I think, has hitherto pleaded guilty to the evidence brought again&s;t him. The tenth commandment, however, goes to the root and principle of evil, it dives to the bottom of things; this command checks the fir&s;t ri&s;ing of &s;in in the heart, teaches us to &s;trangle it in the birth as it were, before it breaks out in tho&s;e acts which are forbidden; as for in&s;tance, every man covets before he proceeds to &s;teal, nay, many covet who dare not &s;teal, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uffer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, lookee, Mr. Worthy, I don't under&s;tand the&s;e new fa&s;hioned explana|tions; one &s;hould not have a grain of &s;heer good|ne&s;s left, if every thing one does is to be frittered away at this rate; I am not, I own, quite &s;o
<PB N="39" REF="41">
good as I thought, but if what you &s;ay were true, I &s;hould be &s;o mi&s;erable, I &s;hould not know what to do with my&s;elf. Why, I tell you, all the world may be &s;aid to break the command|ments at this rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. All the world, and I my&s;elf al&s;o, are but too apt to break them, if not in the letter, at lea&s;t in the &s;pirit of them. Why then all the world are (as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;es it) "guilty before God." And if guilty, they &s;hould own they are guilty, and not &s;tand up and ju&s;tify them&s;elves as you do, Mr. Bragwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, according to my notion, I am a very hone&s;t man, and hone&s;ty is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of all religion, &s;ay I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>All truth, hone&s;ty, ju&s;tice, order, and obedience, grow out of the chri&s;tian reli|gion. The true chri&s;tian acts, at all times, and on all occa&s;ions, from the pure and &s;piritual principle of love to God; on this principle, he is upright in his dealings, true to his word, kind to the poor, helpful to the oppre&s;&s;ed. In &s;hort, if he truly loves God, he mu&s;t do ju&s;tice, and <HI>can't help</HI> loving mercy. Chri&s;tianity is a uni|form con&s;i&s;tent thing. It does not allow us to make up for the breach of one part of GOD'S law, by our &s;trictne&s;s in ob&s;erving another. There is no &s;ponge in one duty, that can wipe out the &s;pot of another &s;in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but at this rate, I &s;hould be always puzzling and blundering, and &s;hould
<PB N="40" REF="42">
never know for certain whether I was right or nor, whereas I am now quite &s;atisfied with my|&s;elf, and have no doubts to torment me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>One way of knowing whether we really de&s;ire to obey the whole law of God is this; when we find we have as great a regard to that part of it, the breach of which does not touch our own intere&s;t, as to that part which does. For in&s;tance, a man robs me; I am in a violent pa&s;&s;ion with him, and when it is &s;aid to me, doe&s;t thou well to be angry? I an&s;wer, I do well. <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal</HI> is a law of GOD, and this fellow has broken that law. Aye, but &s;ays con&s;cience, 'tis <HI>thy own property</HI> which is in que&s;tion.&mdash;He has broken <HI>thy</HI> hedge&mdash;he has &s;tolen <HI>thy</HI> &s;heep&mdash;he has taken, <HI>thy</HI> pur&s;e. Art thou therefore &s;ure whether it is his violation of thy property, or of GOD's law, which provokes thee? I will put a &s;econd ca&s;e&mdash;I hear another &s;wear mo&s;t grievou&s;ly; or I meet him coming drunk out of an alehou&s;e; or I find him &s;inging a loo&s;e, profane &s;ong. If I am not as much grieved for this bla&s;phemer, or this drunkard, as I was for the robber; if I do not take the &s;ame pains to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, which I did to bring the robber to ju&s;tice, "how dwelleth the love of GOD in me?" Is it not clear that I value my own &s;heep more than God's command|ments? That I prize my pur&s;e more than I love my Maker? In &s;hort, whenever I find out that I am more jealous for my own property than for God's law; more careful about my own reputa|tion
<PB N="41" REF="43">
on than <HI>his</HI> honour, I always &s;u&s;pect I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot upon wrong ground, and that even my right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions are not proceeding from a right principle.</P>

And remember that if you &s;eek for a deceitful gaiety, rather than a well grounded cheerfulne&s;s; if you prefer a fal&s;e &s;ecurity to final &s;afety, and now go away to your cattle and your farm, and di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject from your thoughts left it &s;hould make you un|ea&s;y; I am not &s;ure that this &s;imple di&s;cour&s;e may not appear again&s;t you at the day of ac|count, as a fre&s;h proof that you "loved dark|ne&s;s rather than light," and &s;o increa&s;e your con|demnation.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Bragwell was more affected than he cared to own. He went to bed with le&s;s &s;pirits and more humility than u&s;ual. He did not how|ever care to let Mr. Worthy &s;ee the impre&s;&s;ion which it had made upon him; but at parting next morning, he &s;hook him by the hand more

cordially than u&s;ual, and made him promi&s;e to return his vi&s;it in a &s;hort time.</P>

<P>MR. BRAGWELL, when he returned home from his vi&s;it to Mr. Worthy, as recorded in the Second Part of this Hi&s;tory, found that he was not quite &s;o happy as he had formerly been. The di&s;cour&s;es of Mr. Worthy had broken in not a little on his comfort. And he began to &s;u&s;pect that he was not &s;o completely in the right as his vanity had led him to believe. He &s;eemed al&s;o to feel le&s;s &s;atisfacton in the idle gentility of his own daughters, &s;ince he had been witne&s;s to the &s;implicity, mode&s;ty, and u&s;efulne&s;s of tho&s;e of Mr. Worthy. And he could not help &s;eeing that the vulgar violence of his wi&s;e did not pro|duce &s;o much family happine&s;s at home, as the humble piety and quiet diligence of Mrs. Wor|thy produced in the hou&s;e of his friend.</P>
<P>Happy would it have been for Mr. Bragwell, if he had followed up tho&s;e new convictions of his own mind, which would have led him to &s;truggle again&s;t the power of evil principles in him&s;elf, and to have controuled the force of evil

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abits in his family. But his convictions were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t &s;trong enough to make him unea&s;y under is errors, without driving him to reform them. The &s;light impre&s;&s;ion &s;oon wore off, and he fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ack into his old practices. Still his e&s;teem for Mr. Worthy was not at all abated by the plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealing of that hone&s;t friend. It is true he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">readed his piercing eye. He felt that his ex|ample held out a con&s;tant reproof to him&s;elf. Yet &s;uch is the force of early affection and rooted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">everence, that he longed to &s;ee him at his hou&s;e. This de&s;ire, indeed, as is commonly the ca&s;e, was made up of mixed motives. He wi&s;hed for he plea&s;ure of his friend's company; he longed for that favorite triumph of a vulgar mind, an opportunity of &s;hewing him his riches; and he thought it would rai&s;e his credit in the world, to have a man of Mr. Worthy's character at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell, it is true, &s;till went on with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s in gaining money, and the &s;ame oftentation in &s;pending it. But though he was as covetous as ever, he was not quite &s;o &s;ure that it was right to be &s;o. While he was actually engaged abroad indeed, in tran&s;actions with his dealers, he was not very &s;crupulous about the means by which he <HI>got</HI> his money; and while he was indulging in fe&s;tivity with his friends at home, he was ea&s;y enough as to the manner in which he <HI>&s;pent</HI> it. But a man can neither be making bargains, nor making fea&s;ts always; there mu&s;t be &s;ome intervals between the&s;e two
<PB N="44" REF="46">
great objects for which worldly men may be &s;aid to live; and in &s;ome of the&s;e intervals the mo&s;t worldly form, perhaps, &s;ome random pians of amendment. And though many a one may &s;ay in the fullne&s;s of enjoyment, "Soul, take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink, and be merry;" yet hardly any man, perhaps, allows him&s;elf to &s;ay, even in the mo&s;t &s;ecret moments, I will <HI>never</HI> retire from bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I will <HI>never</HI> repent&mdash;I will <HI>never</HI> think of death&mdash;Eternity &s;hall <HI>never</HI> come into my thoughts. The mo&s;t that &s;uch an one pro|bably ventures to &s;ay is, I need not repent <HI>yet;</HI> I will continue &s;uch a &s;in a little longer; it will be time enough to think on the next world when I am no longer &s;it for the bu&s;ine&s;s or the plea&s;ures of this.</P>
<P>Such was the ca&s;e with Bragwell. He &s;et up in his own mind a general di&s;tant &s;ort of re&s;olu|tion, that <HI>&s;ome years hence,</HI> when he &s;hould be a <HI>few years older,</HI> and a <HI>few</HI> thou&s;ands richer; when a &s;ew more of his <HI>pre&s;ent &s;chemes &s;hould be compleated,</HI> he would then think of altering his cour&s;e of life. He would then certainly &s;et about &s;pending a religious old age; he would reform &s;ome practices in his dealings, or perhaps quit bu&s;ine&s;s intirely; he would think about reading good books, and when he had com|pleated &s;uch and &s;uch a purcha&s;e, he would even begin to give &s;omething to the poor, but at pre&s;ent he really had little to &s;pare for charity. The very rea&s;on why he &s;hould have given more, was ju&s;t the cau&s;e he a&s;&s;igned for not giving at
<PB N="45" REF="47">
all, namely, the <HI>hardne&s;s of the times.</HI> The true, grand &s;ource of charity, &s;elf-denial, never came into his head. <HI>Spend le&s;s</HI> that you may <HI>&s;ave more,</HI> he would have thought a &s;hrewd maxim enough. But <HI>&s;pend le&s;s</HI> that you may <HI>&s;pare more,</HI> never entered into his book of Proverbs.</P>
<P>At length the time came when Mr. Worthy had promi&s;ed to return his vi&s;it. It was indeed a little ha&s;tened by the notice that Mr. Bragwell would have, in the cour&s;e of the week, a piece of land to &s;ell by auction; and though Mr. Wor|thy believed the price was likely to be above his pocket, yet he knew it was an occa&s;ion which would be likely to bring the principal Farmers of that neighbourhood together, &s;ome of whom he wanted to meet. And it was on this occa|&s;ion that Mr. Bragwell prided him&s;elf, that he &s;hould &s;hew his neighbour's &s;o &s;en&s;ible a man as his dear friend Mr. Worthy.</P>
<P>Worthy arrived at his friend's hou&s;e on the Saturday, time enough to &s;ee the hou&s;e, and garden, and grounds of Mr. Bragwell by day|light. He &s;aw with plea&s;ure (for he had a warm and generous heart) tho&s;e evident &s;igns of his friend's pro&s;perity, but as he was a man of a &s;obber mind, and was a mo&s;t exact dealer in truth, he never allowed his tongue the licence of immode&s;t commendation, which he u&s;ed to &s;ay eicher favoured of flattery or envy. Indeed he never rated mere worldly things &s;o highly as to be&s;tow upon them undue prai&s;e. His calm ap|probation
<PB N="46" REF="48">
probation &s;omewhat di&s;appointed the vanity of Mr. Bragwell, who could not help &s;ecretly &s;u&s;|pecting that his friend, as good a man as he was, was not quite free from envy. He felt, however, very much inclined to forgive this jealou&s;y, which he feared the &s;ight of his ample property, and hand&s;ome habitation, mu&s;t natu|rally awaken in the mind of a man whole own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were &s;o inferior. He practi&s;ed the u&s;ual trick of ordinary and vulgar minds, that of pretending him&s;elf to find &s;ome fault with tho&s;e things which were particularly de&s;erving prai&s;e, when he found Worthy di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>When they came in to &s;upper, he affected to talk of the comforts of Mr. Worthy's <HI>little</HI> par|lour, by way of calling his attention to his own large one. He repeated the word <HI>&s;nug,</HI> as ap|plied to every thing at Mr. Worthy's, with the plain de&s;ign to make compari&s;ons favourable to his own more ample domains. He contrived, as he pa&s;&s;ed by to his chair, by a &s;eeming acci|dent, to pu&s;h open the door of a large beau&s;et in the parlour, in which all the finery was mo&s;t oftentatiou&s;ly &s;et out to view. He protected, with a look of &s;atisfaction which belied his words, that for his part he did not care a farthing for all this trumpery; and then &s;miling and rubbing his hands, added with an air of no &s;mall importance, what a good thing it is, though for people of &s;ub&s;tance, that the tax on plate is taken off. You are a happy man, Mr. Worthy, you do
<PB N="47" REF="49">
not feel the&s;e things; tax or no tax it is all the &s;ame to you. He took care during this &s;peech, by a ca&s;t of his eye, to direct Mr. Worthy's at|tention to a great profu&s;ion of the brighte&s;t cups, &s;alvers and tankards, and other &s;hining orna|ments, which crowded the beau&s;et. Mr. Wor|thy gravely an&s;wered; Mr. Bragwell, it was in|deed a tax which could not affect &s;o plain a man as my&s;elf, but as it fell on a mere luxury, and therefore could not hurt the poor, I was always &s;orry that it could not be made productive enough to be continued. A man in my middling &s;itua|tion, who is contented with a good gla&s;s of beer, poured from a hand&s;ome earthen mug, the gla&s;s, the mug, and the beer, all of Engli&s;h manufac|ture, will be but little di&s;turbed at taxes on plate or on wine; but he will regret, as I do, that many of the&s;e taxes are &s;o much evaded, that new taxes are continually brought on to make up the deficiencies of the old.</P>
<P>During &s;upper the young ladies &s;at in di&s;dain|ful &s;ilence, not deigning to be&s;tow the &s;malle&s;t civility on &s;o plain a man as Mr. Worthy. They left the room with their Mamma as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, being impatient to get away to ridicule their father's friend at full liberty.</P>
<P><HI>The Dance; or, the Chri&s;tmas Merry-making.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr. Worthy a&s;ked Bragwell how his family comforts &s;tood, and how his daughters, who, he &s;aid, were really
<PB N="48" REF="50">
fine young women, went on. O, as to that, replied Bragwell, pretty much like other men's hand&s;ome daughters, I &s;uppo&s;e, that is, wor&s;e and wor&s;e. I really begin to apprehend that their fanta&s;tical notions have gained &s;uch a head, that after all the money I have &s;craped together, I &s;hall never get them well married. Bet&s;y has ju&s;t lo&s;t as good an offer as any girl could de&s;ire, young Wil&s;on, an hone&s;t, &s;ub&s;tantial grazier as any in the county. He not only knows every thing proper for his &s;tation, but is plea&s;ing in his behaviour, and a pretty &s;cholar into the bar|gain; he reads hi&s;tory books and voyages, of a winter's evening, to his infirm father, in&s;tead of going to the card a&s;&s;embly in our town; he neither likes drinking nor &s;porting, and is a &s;ort of favourite with our Par&s;on, becau&s;e he takes in the weekly numbers of a fine Bible with Cuts, and &s;ub&s;cribes to the Sunday School, and makes a fu&s;s about helping the poor, the&s;e dear times, as they call them, but I think they are good times for <HI>us,</HI> Mr. Worthy. Well, for all this, Bet&s;y only de&s;pi&s;ed him, and laughed at him; but as he is both hand&s;ome and rich, I thought &s;he might come round at la&s;t; and &s;o I invited him to come and &s;tay a day or two at Chri&s;tmas, when we have always a little &s;ort of merry-making here. But it would not do. He &s;corned to talk that palavering &s;tuff which &s;he has been u&s;ed to in the marble covered books I told you of. He told her, indeed, that it would be the happine&s;s of his heart to live with her, which I own I
<PB N="49" REF="51">
thought was as much as could be expected of any man. But Mi&s;s had no notion of marrying one who was only de&s;irous of living with her. No, no, for&s;ooth, her lover mu&s;t declare him|&s;elf ready to die for her, which hone&s;t Wil&s;on was not &s;uch a fool as to offer to do. In the afternoon, however, he got a little into her fa|vour by making out a Rebus or two, in the Lady's Diary, and &s;he conde&s;cended to &s;ay, &s;he did not think Mr. Wil&s;on had been &s;o good a &s;cholar; but he &s;oon &s;poilt all again. We had a bit of a hop in the evening. The young man, though he had not much ta&s;te for tho&s;e &s;ort of gambols, yet thought he could &s;oot it a little in the old-fa&s;hioned way. So he a&s;ked Bet&s;y to be his partner. But when he a&s;ked what dance they &s;hould call, Mi&s;s drew up her head, and in a &s;trange gibberi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould dance nothing but a <HI>Menuct de la Cour,</HI> and ordered him to call it; Wil&s;on &s;tared, and hone&s;tly told her &s;he mu&s;t call it her&s;elf, for he could neither &s;pell nor pro|nounce &s;uch outlandi&s;h words. I bur&s;t out a laughing, and told him I &s;uppo&s;ed it was &s;ome|thing like que&s;tions and commands, and if &s;o, that was much merrier than dancing. Seeing her partner &s;tanding &s;tock &s;till and not knowing how to get out of the &s;crape, the girl began by her&s;elf, and fell to &s;wimming, and &s;inking, and ca|pering, and flouri&s;hing, and po&s;turing, for all the world ju&s;t like the man on the &s;lack rope at our fair. But &s;eeing Wil&s;on &s;tanding like a &s;tuck pig, and we all laughing at her, &s;he re&s;olved to
<PB N="50" REF="52">
wreak her malice upon him; &s;o, with a look of rage and di&s;dain, &s;he advi&s;ed him to go down country bumkin, with the dairy maid, who would make a much fitter partner, as well as wi&s;e, for him, than &s;he could do. I am quite of your mind, Mi&s;s, &s;aid he, with more &s;pirit than I thought was in him; you may make a good partner for a dance, but you would make a &s;ad one to go through life with. I will take my leave of you, Mi&s;s, with this &s;hort &s;tory. I had lately a pretty large concern in hay-job|bing, which took me to London. I waited a good while in the Hay-market for my dealer, and, to pa&s;s away the time, I &s;tepped into a &s;ort of &s;inging play-hou&s;e there, where I was grieved to the heart to &s;ee young women painted and dizened out, and capering away ju&s;t as you have been doing. I thought it bad enough in them, and wondered, the quality could be entertained with &s;uch indecent mummery. But little did I think to meet with the &s;ame paint, &s;inery, and tricks, in a farm hou&s;e. I will never marry a woman who de&s;pi&s;es me, nor the &s;tation in which I &s;hould place her, and &s;o I take my leave.&mdash;Poor girl, how &s;he <HI>was</HI> provoked! to be pub|licly refu&s;ed, and turned off, as it were, by a grazier! But it was of u&s;e to &s;ome of the other girls, who have not held up their heads quite &s;o high &s;ince, nor painted quite &s;o red, but have conde&s;cended to &s;peak to their equals.</P>
<P>But how I run on! I forget it is Saturday night, and that I ought to be paying my work|men, who are all waiting for me without.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
<HI>Saturday Night; or the Workmens' Wages.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. Bragwell had done paying his men, Mr. Worthy &s;aid to him, I have made it a habit, and I hope not an unprofitable one, of trying to turn to &s;ome moral u&s;e, not only all the events of daily life, but all the employments of it too. And though it occurs &s;o often, I hardly know one that &s;ets me a thinking more &s;eriou&s;ly than the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s you have been ju&s;t di&s;|charging. Aye, &s;aid Bragwell, it &s;ets me think|ing too, and &s;eriou&s;ly, as you &s;ay, when I ob|&s;erve how much the price of wages is increa&s;ed. Yes, yes, you are ready enough to think of that, &s;aid Worthy, but you &s;ay not a word of how much the value of your land is increa&s;ed, and that the more you pay, the more you can afford to pay. But the thoughts I &s;poke of are quite of another ca&s;t. When I call in my labourers, on a Saturday night, to pay them, it often brings to my mind the great and general day of ac|count, when I, and you, and all of us, &s;hall be called to our grand and awful reckoning, when we &s;hall go to receive <HI>our</HI> wages, ma&s;ter and &s;er|vants, farmer and labourer. When I &s;ee that one of my men has failed of the wages he &s;hould have received, becau&s;e he has been idling at a fair; another has lo&s;t a day by a drinking bout, a third confe&s;&s;es that, though he had ta&s;k work, and might have earned &s;till more, yet he has been carele&s;s, and has not his full pay to receive;
<PB N="52" REF="54">
this, I &s;ay, &s;ometimes &s;ets me on thinking whether I al&s;o have made the mo&s;t of my time. And when I come to pay even the more diligent who have worked all the week; when I reflect that even the&s;e have done no more than it was their duty to do, I cannot help &s;aying to my&s;elf, night is come; Saturday night is come. No re|pentance, or diligence on the part of the&s;e poor men can now make a bad week's work good. This week is gone into eternity. To-morrow is the &s;ea&s;on of re&s;t; working time is over. My life al&s;o will &s;oon be &s;wallowed up in eternity; &s;oon the &s;pace allotted me for diligence, for labour, will be over. Soon will the grand que&s;tion be a&s;ked, "What ha&s;t thou done? Did&s;t thou u&s;e thy working days to the end for which they were given?" With &s;ome &s;uch thoughts I commonly go to bed, and they help to quicken me to a keener diligence for the next week.</P>
<P><HI>Some account of a Sunday in Mr. Bragwell's Family.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Worthy had been for &s;o many years u&s;ed to the &s;ober ways of his own well-ordered family, that he greatly di&s;liked to pa&s;s a Sunday in any hou&s;e of which Religion was not the go|verning principle. Indeed, he commonly or|dered his affairs, and regulated his journies with an eye to this object. To pa&s;s a Sunday in an irreligious family, &s;aid he, is always un|plea&s;ant, often un&s;afe. I &s;eldom find I can do
<PB N="53" REF="55">
them any good, and they may perhaps do me &s;ome harm. At lea&s;t, I am giving a &s;anction to their manner of pa&s;&s;ing it, if I pa&s;s it in the &s;ame manner. If I reprove them, I &s;ubject my&s;elf to the charge of &s;ingularity, and of being "righteous over much;" if I do <HI>not</HI> reprove them, I confirm and &s;trengthen them in evil. And whether I reprove them or not, I certainly partake of their guilt if I &s;pend it as they do.</P>
<P>He had, however, &s;o &s;trong a de&s;ire to be u&s;e|ful to Mr. Bragwell, that he at length deter|mined to break through his common practice, and pa&s;s the Sunday at his hou&s;e. Mr. Worthy was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that though the church bell was going, the breakfa&s;t was not ready, and expre&s;&s;ed his wonder how this &s;hould be the ca&s;e in &s;o in|du&s;trious a family. Bragwell made &s;ome auk|ward excu&s;es. He &s;aid his wife worked her &s;er|vants fo hard all the week, that even &s;he, as notable as &s;he was, a little relaxed from the &s;trict|ne&s;s of her demands on Sunday mornings; and he owned that in a general way, no one was up early enough for church. He confe&s;&s;ed that his wife commonly &s;pent the morning in making puddings, pies, and cakes, to la&s;t through the week, as Sunday was the only lei&s;ure time &s;he and her maids had. Mr. Worthy &s;oon &s;aw an uncommon bu&s;tle in the hou&s;e. All hands were bu&s;y. It was nothing but baking and boiling, and frying, and roa&s;ting, and running, and &s;cold|ing, and eating. The boy was kept from church to clean the plate, the man to gather the fruit,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
the mi&s;tre&s;s to make the chee&s;e cakes, the maids to dre&s;s the dinner, and the young ladies to dre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The truth was, Mrs. Bragwell, who had heard much of the order and good management of Mr. Worthy's family, but who looked down with di&s;|dain upon them as far le&s;s rich than her&s;elf, was re&s;olved to indulge her vanity on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion. She was determined to be even with Mrs. Worthy, in whole prai&s;es Bragwell had been &s;o loud, and felt no &s;mall plea&s;ure in the hope of making her gue&s;t unea&s;y, when he &s;hould be &s;truck with the di&s;play both of her &s;kill and her wealth. Mr. Worthy was indeed &s;truck to be|hold as large a dinner as he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee at a Ju&s;tice's meeting. He, who&s;e frugal and pious wife had accu&s;tomed him only to &s;uch a plain Sunday's dinner as could be dre&s;&s;ed with|out keeping any one from church, when he &s;ur|veyed the loaded table of his friend, in&s;tead of feeling that envy which the&s;e grand preparations were meant to rai&s;e, felt nothing but di&s;gu&s;t at the vanity of his friend's wife, mixed with much thankfulne&s;s for the piety of his own.</P>
<P>After having made the dinner wait a long time, the Mi&s;s Bragwells marched in, dre&s;&s;ed as if they were going to the A&s;&s;ize-Ball; they looked very &s;cornful at having been &s;o hurried; though they had been dre&s;&s;ing ever &s;ince they got up, and their fond father, when he &s;aw them &s;o fine, forgave all their impertinence, and ca&s;t an eye of triumph on Mr. Worthy, who felt he had
<PB N="55" REF="57">
never loved his own humble daughters &s;o well as at that moment.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the whole party went to church. To do them ju&s;tice, it was indeed their common practice once a day, when the weather was good, and the road was neither du&s;ty nor dirty, when the Mini&s;ter did not begin too early, when the young ladies had not been di&s;appointed of their new bonnets on the Saturday night, and when they had no &s;mart company in the hou&s;e who rather wi&s;hed to &s;tay at home. When this la&s;t was the ca&s;e, which, to &s;ay the truth, hap|pened pretty often, it was thought a piece of good manners to conform to the humour of the gue&s;ts. Mr. Bragwell had this day forborne to a&s;k any of his u&s;ual company, well knowing that their vain and worldly conver&s;ation would only &s;erve to draw on him &s;ome new reprimand from his friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell and her daughters picked up, as u&s;ual, a good deal of acquaintance at church. Many compliments pa&s;&s;ed, and much of the news of the week was retailed before the &s;ervice began. They waited with impatience for the reading the le&s;&s;ons as a licen&s;ed &s;ea&s;on for whi&s;|pering, and the &s;ubject begun during the le&s;&s;ons, was fini&s;hed while they were &s;inging. The young ladies made an appointment for the after|noon with a friend in the next pew, while their Mamma took the opportunity of enquiring the character of a dairy maid, which &s;he ob&s;erved
<PB N="56" REF="58">
with a compliment to her own good manage|ment, would &s;ave time on a week-day.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who found him&s;elf quite in a new world, returned home with his friend alone. In the evening he ventured to a&s;k Bragwell, if he did not, on a Sunday night, at lea&s;t, make it a cu&s;tom to read and pray with his family. Brag|well told him, he was &s;orry to &s;ay he had no fa|mily at home, el&s;e he &s;hould like to do it for the &s;ake of example. But as his &s;ervants worked hard all the week, his wife was of opinion that they &s;hould then have a little holiday. Mr. Worthy pre&s;&s;ed it home upon him, whether the utter neglect of his &s;ervants' principles was not likely to make a heavy article in his final account: and a&s;ked him if he did not believe that the too general liberty of meeting together, jaunting, and diverting them&s;elves, on Sunday evenings, was not often found to produce the wor&s;t effects on the morals of &s;ervants, and the good order of families ? I put it to your con&s;cience, &s;aid he, Mr. Bragwell, whether Sunday, which was meant as a ble&s;&s;ing and a benefit, is not, as it is commonly kept, turned into the mo&s;t mi&s;chiev|ous part of the week, by the &s;elfi&s;h kindne&s;s of ma&s;ters, who, not daring to &s;et their &s;ervants about any public work, allot them that day to follow their own devices, that they them&s;elves may with more rigour refu&s;e them a little in|dulgence and a rea&s;onable holiday in the work|ing part of the week, which a good &s;ervant has now and then a fair right to expect. Tho&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="59">
ma&s;ters who will give them half, or all the Lord's day, will not &s;pare them a &s;ingle hour of a working day. <HI>Their</HI> work <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be done; God's work may be let alone.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell owned that Sunday had pro|duced many mi&s;chiefs in his own family. That the young men and maids, having no eye upon them, frequently went to improper places with other &s;ervants, turned adri&s;t like them&s;elves. That in the&s;e parties the poor girls were too frequently led a&s;tray, and the men got to public hou&s;es, and fives playing. But it was none of his bu&s;ine&s;s to watch them. His family only did as others do; indeed it was his wife's con|cern; and as &s;he was &s;o good a manager on other days, that &s;he would not &s;pare them an hour to vi&s;it a &s;ick father or mother, it would be hard, &s;he &s;aid, if they might not have Sunday afternoon to them&s;elves, and &s;he could not blame them for making the mo&s;t of it. Indeed, &s;he was &s;o indulgent in this particular, that &s;he often excu&s;ed the men from going to church that they might &s;erve the bea&s;ts, and the maids that they might get the milking done before the holiday part of the evening came on. She would not indeed hear of any competition between doing <HI>her</HI> work and taking their plea&s;ure;. but when the difference lay between their going to church and taking their pea&s;ure, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ay that for his wife, &s;he always inclined to the good-natured &s;ide of the que&s;tion. She is &s;trict enough in keeping them &s;ober, becau&s;e drunkenne&s;s is a
<PB N="58" REF="60">
co&s;tly &s;in; and to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he does not care how little they &s;in at her expence.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, I always like to examine both &s;ides fairly, and to &s;ee the different effects of oppo&s;ite practices; now, which plan produces the greate&s;t &s;hare of comfort to the ma&s;ter, and of profit to the &s;ervants in the long run? Your &s;ervants, 'tis likely, are very much attached to you; and very fond of living where they get their own way in &s;o great a point.</P>
<P>O, as to that, replied Bragwell, you are quite out. My hou&s;e is a &s;cene of di&s;cord, mutiny, and di&s;content. And thoug there is not a bet|ter manager in England than my wife, yet &s;he is always changing her &s;ervants, &s;o that every quarter-day is a &s;ort of gaol-delivery at my hou&s;e; and when they go off, as they often do, at a moment's warning, to own the truth, I often give them money privately, that they may not carry my wife before the Ju&s;tice to get their wages.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, that all your worldly compliances do not procure you even worldly happine&s;s. As to my own family, I take care to let them &s;ee that their plea&s;ure is bound up with their duty, and that what they may call my &s;trictne&s;s, has nothing in view but their &s;afety and happine&s;s. By this means, I com|monly gain their love as well as &s;ecure their obedience. I know, that with all my care, I am liable to be di&s;appointed, "from the corruption that is in the world through &s;in." But when|ever this happens, &s;o far from encouraging me in
<PB N="59" REF="61">
remi&s;&s;ene&s;s, it only &s;erves to quicken my zeal. If, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, my &s;ervant turns out a good Chri&s;tian, I have been an humble in&s;tru|ment in his hand of &s;aving a &s;oul committed to my charge.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell came home, but brought only one of her daughters with her, the other, &s;he &s;aid, had given them the &s;lip, and was gone with a young friend, and would not return for a day or two. Mr. Bragwell was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed; as he knew that young friend had but a &s;light character, and kept bad acquaintances. Mrs. Bragwell came in, all hurry and bu&s;tle, &s;aying, if her family did not go to bed with the Lamb on Sundays, when they had nothing to do, how could they ri&s;e with the Lark on Mondays, when &s;o much was to be done.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy had this night much matter for reflexion. We need not, &s;aid he, go into the great world to look for di&s;&s;ipation and vanity. We can find both in a farm hou&s;e. As for me and my hou&s;e, continued he, we will &s;erve the Lord every day, but e&s;pecially on Sundays. It is the day which the Lord hath made: hath made for him&s;elf; we will rejoice in it and con&s;ider the religious u&s;e of it not only as a duty but as a privilege.</P>
<P>The next morning Mr. Bragwell and his friend &s;et out early for the Golden Lion. What pa&s;&s;ed on this little journey, my readers &s;hall hear next month.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>IT was mentioned in the la&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory, that the chief rea&s;on which had drawn Mr. Worthy to vi&s;it his friend ju&s;t at the pre&s;ent time, was, that Mr. Bragwell had a &s;mall e&s;tate to &s;ell by auction. Mr. Worthy, though he did not think he &s;hould be a bidder, wi&s;hed to be pre&s;ent, as he had bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle with one or two per&s;ons, who were expected at the Golden Lion on that day, and he had put off his vi&s;it till he had &s;een the &s;ale adverti&s;ed in the County Paper.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy &s;et out early on the Monday morning, on their way to the Golden Lion, a &s;mall inn, in a neighbouring market town. As they had time before them, they had agreed to ride &s;lowly, that they might conver&s;e on &s;ome u&s;eful &s;ubject; but here, as u&s;ual, they had two opinions about the &s;ame thing. Mr. Bragwell's notion of an u&s;eful &s;ub|ject was, &s;omething by which money was to be got, and a good bargain &s;truck. Mr. Worthy was no le&s;s a man of bu&s;ine&s;s than his friend. His &s;chemes were wi&s;e, and his calculations ju&s;t his reputation for integrity and good &s;en&s;e made him the common judge and umpire in his neigh|bours affairs, while no one paid a more exact attention to every tran&s;action of his own. But
<PB N="61" REF="63">
the bu&s;ine&s;s of getting money was not with him the fir&s;t, much le&s;s was it the whole concern of the day. Every morning when he ro&s;e, he re|membered that he had a Maker to wor&s;hip, as well as a family to maintain. Religion, however, never made him neglect bu&s;ine&s;s, though it &s;ometimes led him to po&s;tpone it. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, no man had any rea&s;on to expect God's ble&s;&s;ing through the day who did not a&s;k it in the morning; nor was he likely to &s;pend the day in the fear of God, who did not begin it with his wor&s;hip. But he had not the le&s;s &s;en&s;e, &s;pirit, and activity, when he was among men abroad, becau&s;e he had fir&s;t &s;erved God at home.</P>
<P>As the&s;e two Farmers rode along, Mr. Worthy took occa&s;ion, from the finene&s;s of the day, and the beauty of the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed, to turn the di&s;cour&s;e to the goodne&s;s of God, and our infinite obligations to him. He knew that the tran&s;ition from thank&s;giving to prayer would be natural and ea&s;y, and he there|fore &s;lid, by degrees, into that important &s;ubject: and he ob&s;erved, that &s;ecret prayer was a duty of univer&s;al obligation, which every man had it in his power to fulfil; and which he &s;eriou&s;ly be|lieved was the ground-work of all religious prac|tice, and of all devout affections.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell felt con&s;cious that he was very negligent and irregular in the performance of this duty; indeed, he con&s;idered it as a mere cere|mony, or at lea&s;t, as a duty which might give way to the &s;lighte&s;t temptation of drow&s;ine&s;s at
<PB N="62" REF="64">
night, or of bu&s;ine&s;s in the morning. As he knew he did not live in the con&s;cientious per|formance of this practice, he tried to ward off the &s;ubject, knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things. After &s;ome eva&s;ion, he at la&s;t &s;aid, he certainly thought private prayer a good cu&s;tom, e&s;pecially for people who have time; and tho&s;e who were &s;ick, or old, or out of bu&s;ine&s;s, could not do better; but that for his part, he believed much of the&s;e &s;ort of things was not expected from men in active life.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think, Mr. Bragwell, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to temptation &s;tand mo&s;t in need of prayer; now there are few, methinks, who are more expo&s;ed to temptation than men in bu&s;ine&s;s, for tho&s;e mu&s;t be in mo&s;t danger, at lea&s;t, from the world, who have mo&s;t to do with it. And if this be true, ought we not to prepare our&s;elves in the clo&s;et for the trials of the market, the field, and the &s;hop? It is but putting on our armour before we go out to battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I think example is the whole of religion, and if the ma&s;ter of a family is orderly, and regular, and goes to church, he does every thing which can be required of him, and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, Mr. Bragwell, that highly as I rate a good example, &s;till I mu&s;t &s;et a good principle above it. I know I mu&s;t keep good order indeed, for the &s;ake of others;
<PB N="63" REF="65">
but I mu&s;t keep a good con&s;cience for my own &s;ake. To God I owe &s;ecret piety, I mu&s;t there|fore pray to him in private.&mdash;To my family I owe a chri&s;tian example, and for that, among other rea&s;ons, I mu&s;t not fail to go to church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are talking, Mr. Worthy, as if I were an enemy to Chri&s;tianity. Sir, I am no Heathen. Sir, I belong to the Church; I go to Church; I always drink pro&s;perity to the Church. You your&s;elf, as &s;trict as you are, in never mi&s;&s;ing it twice a day, are not a warmer friend to the Church than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to &s;ay, you know its value as an in&s;titution, but you do not &s;eem to know that a man may be very irreligious under the be&s;t religious in&s;titutions; and that even the mo&s;t excellent of them are but <HI>means</HI> of being religious, and are no more religion it&s;elf than brick and mortar are prayers and thank&s;givings. I &s;hall never think, however high their profe&s;&s;ion, and even however regular their attendance, that tho&s;e men truly re&s;pect the Church, who bring home little of that religion which is taught in it into their own families, or their own hearts; or, who make the whole of Chri&s;tianity to con&s;i&s;t in their attendance there. Excu&s;e me, Mr. Brag|well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worthy, I am per&s;uaded that religion is quite a proper thing for the poor; and I don't think that the multitude can ever be kept in order without it; and I am a &s;ort of
<PB N="64" REF="66">
a politician you know. We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have bits, and bridles, and re&s;traints for the vulgar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your opinion is very ju&s;t, as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough, &s;ince it does not go to the root of the evil, for while you value your&s;elf on the &s;oundne&s;s of this principle as a politician, I wi&s;h you al&s;o to &s;ee the rea&s;on of it as a Chri&s;tian; depend upon it, if religion be good for the community at large, it is equally good for every family; and what is right for a family is equally right for each individual in it. You have therefore your&s;elf brought the mo&s;t unan&s;werable argument why you ought to be re|ligious your&s;elf, by a&s;king how we &s;hall keep others in order without religion. For, believe me, Mr. Bragwell, there is no particular clau&s;e to except you in the Go&s;pel. There are no ex|ceptions there in favour of any one cla&s;s of men. The &s;ame re&s;traints which are nece&s;&s;ary for the people at large are equally nece&s;&s;ary for men of every order, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, learned and ignorant. If Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for no particular rank, cla&s;s, or community, there is no one rank, cla&s;s, or communion, exempt from the obedience to his laws enjoined by the Go&s;pel. May I a&s;k you, Mr. Bragwell, what is your rea&s;on for going to Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am &s;hocked at your que&s;tion. How can I avoid doing a thing &s;o cu&s;tomary and &s;o creditable? Not go to Church, indeed! What do you take me for, Mr. Worthy? I am afraid you &s;u&s;pect me to be a Papi&s;t, or a Hea|then,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
or of &s;ome religion or other that is not what it &s;hould be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>If a foreigner were to hear how violently one &s;et of Chri&s;tians in this country often &s;peak again&s;t another, how earne&s;t would he &s;uppo&s;e us all to be in religious matters: and how a&s;toni&s;hed to di&s;cover that many a man has perhaps little other proof to give of the &s;incerity of his own religion, except the violence with which he hates the religion of another party. It is not <HI>irreligion</HI> which &s;uch men hate; but the religion of the man, or the party, whom they are &s;et again&s;t: now hatred is certainly no part of the religion of the Go&s;pel. Well, you have told me why you go to Church; now pray tell me, why do you confe&s;s there on your bended knees every Sunday, that "you have erred and &s;trayed from God's ways?" "that there is no health in you?" "that you have done what you ought not to do?" "and that you are a mi&s;erable &s;inner?"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e it is in the Common Prayer Book, to be &s;ure, a book which I have heard you your&s;elf &s;ay was written by wi&s;e and good men, the pillars of the Prote&s;tant Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you no other rea&s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you repeat that excellent form of confe&s;&s;ion, do you really feel that you <HI>are</HI> a mi&s;erable &s;inner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't &s;ay I do. But that is no objection to my repeating it, becau&s;e it may &s;uit the ca&s;e of many who are &s;o. I &s;uppo&s;e the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
good Doctors who drew it up, intended that part for wicked people only, &s;uch as drunkards, and thieves, and murderers; for I imagine they could not well contrive to make the &s;ame prayer quire &s;uit an hone&s;t man and a rogue; and &s;o I &s;up|po&s;e they thought it &s;afer to make a good man repeat a prayer which &s;uited a rogue, than to make a rogue repeat a prayer which &s;uited a good man; and you know it is &s;o cu&s;tomary for every body to repeat the general confe&s;&s;ion, that it can't hurt the credit of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons, though every re&s;pectable per&s;on mu&s;t know they have no particular concern in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, Mr. Bragwell, tho&s;e good Doctors you &s;peak of, were not quite of your opinion; they really thought that what you call hone&s;t men, were grievous &s;inners in a certain &s;en&s;e, and that the be&s;t of us &s;tand in need of making that humble confe&s;&s;ion. Mr. Bragwell, do you believe in the fall of Adam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure I do, and a &s;ad thing for Adam it was; why, it is in the Bible, is it not? It is one of the prettie&s;t chapters in Ge|ne&s;is. Don't <HI>you</HI> believe it, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly I do. But I don't believe it <HI>merely</HI> becau&s;e I read it in Gene&s;is; though I know, indeed, that I am bound to believe every part of the word of God. But I have &s;till an additional rea&s;on for believing in the fall of the fir&s;t man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you, indeed? Now, I can't gue&s;s what that can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="69">
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my own ob&s;ervation of what is within my&s;elf teaches me to believe it. It is not only the third chapter of Gene&s;is which convinces me of the truth of the fall, but al&s;o the &s;inful inclinations which I find in my own heart corre&s;ponding with it. This is one of tho&s;e leading truths of Chri&s;tianity of which I can never doubt a moment; fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is abundantly expre&s;&s;ed or implied in Scripture; and next, becau&s;e the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evil nature I carry about with me confirms the doctrine beyond all doubt. Be&s;ides, is it not &s;aid in Scripture, that by one man &s;in entered into the world, and that "all we, like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray; that by one man's di&s;|obedience many were made &s;inners;" and &s;o again in twenty more places that I could tell you of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; I never thought of this. But is not this a very melancholy &s;ort of doctrine, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is melancholy, indeed, if we &s;top here. But while we are deploring this &s;ad truth, let us take comfort from another, that "As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I remember I thought tho&s;e very fine words, when I heard them &s;aid over my poor father's grave. But as it was in the Burial of the Dead, I did not think of taking it to my&s;elf; for I was then young and hearty, and in little danger of dying, and I have been
<PB N="68" REF="70">
&s;o bu&s;y ever &s;ince, that I have hardly had time to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the &s;ervice pronounced at the burial of all who die, is a &s;olemn admonition to all who live. It is there &s;aid, as indeed the Scripture &s;ays al&s;o, "I am the re&s;urrection and the life; who&s;oever <HI>believeth in me</HI> &s;hall never die, but I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day." Now do you think you <HI>believe in Chri&s;t,</HI> Mr. Brag|well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure I do; why you are always fancying me an Athei&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>In order to believe in Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t believe fir&s;t in our own guilt and our own unworthine&s;s; and when we do this we &s;hall &s;ee the u&s;e of a Saviour, and not till then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this is a new way of talk|ing. I can't &s;ay I ever meddled with &s;uch &s;ub|jects before in my life. But now, what do you advi&s;e a man to do upon your plan of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all this leads me back to the ground from which we &s;et out, I mean the duty of prayer; for if we believe that we have an evil nature within us, and that we &s;tand in need of God's grace to help us, and a Saviour to redeem us, we &s;hall be led of cour&s;e to pray for what we &s;o much need; and without this conviction we &s;hall not be led to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but don't you think, Mr. Worthy, that you good folks who make &s;o much of prayer, have lower notions than we have of the wi&s;dom of the Almighty? You think he
<PB N="69" REF="71">
wants to be informed of the things you tell him; whereas, I take it for granted, that he knows them already, and that, being &s;o good as he is, he will give me every thing he &s;ees fit to give me, without my a&s;king it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>God, indeed, who knows all things, knows what we want before we a&s;k him; but &s;till has he not &s;aid, that "with prayer and &s;uppli|cation we mu&s;t make known our reque&s;ts unto him?" Prayer is the way in which God hath &s;aid that his favour mu&s;t be &s;ought. It is the chan|nel through which he hath declared it is his &s;ove|reign will and plea&s;ure that his ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be conveyed to us. What a&s;cends up in prayer de&s;cends again to us in ble&s;&s;ings. It is like the rain which ju&s;t now fell, and which had been drawn up from the ground in vapours to the clouds before it de&s;cended from them to the earth in that re|fre&s;hing &s;hower. Be&s;ides, prayer has a good effect: on our minds; it tends to excite a right di&s;po&s;ition towards God in us, and to keep up a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of our dependance. But above all, it is the way to get the good things we want. "A&s;k," &s;ays the Scripture, "and ye &s;hall re|ceive."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now that is the very thing which I was going to deny. For the truth is, men do not always get what they a&s;k; I believe if I could get a good crop for a&s;king it, I &s;hould pray oftener than I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes, Mr. Bragwell, men "a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s." They
<PB N="70" REF="72">
a&s;k worldly ble&s;&s;ings, perhaps, when they &s;hould a&s;k &s;piritual ones. Now the latter, which are the good things I &s;poke of, are always granted to tho&s;e who pray to God for them, though the former are not. I have ob&s;erved in the ca&s;e of &s;ome worldly things I have &s;ought for, that the grant of my prayer would have cau&s;ed the mi&s;ery of my life; &s;o that God equally con&s;ults our good in what he withholds, and in what he be|&s;tows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you continue to pray on, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; but then I try to mend as to the object of my prayers. I pray for God's ble&s;&s;ing and favour, which is better than riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem very earne&s;t on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>To cut the matter &s;hort; I a&s;k then, whether prayer is not po&s;itively commanded in the Go&s;pel? When this is the ca&s;e, we can never di&s;pute about the nece&s;&s;ity or the duty of a thing, as we may when there is no &s;uch com|mand. Here, however, let me ju&s;t add al&s;o, that a man's prayers may be turned to no &s;mall u&s;e in the way of di&s;covering to him whatever is ami&s;s in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o, Mr. Worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;uppo&s;e now, you were to try your&s;elf by turning into the &s;hape of a prayer every practice in which you allow your&s;elf. For in&s;tance, let the prayer in the morning be a &s;ort of preparation for the deeds of the day, and the
<PB N="71" REF="73">
prayer at night a &s;ort of ob&s;ervation on tho&s;e deeds. You, Mr. Bragwell, I &s;u&s;pect, are a little inclined to covetou&s;ne&s;s; excu&s;e me, Sir. Now &s;uppo&s;e after you have been during a whole day a little too eager to get rich, &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, you were to try how it would &s;ound to beg of God at night on your knees, to give you &s;till more money, though you have already &s;o much that you know not what to do with it. Suppo&s;e you were to pray in the morning, "O Lord, give me more riches, though tho&s;e I have are a &s;nare and a temptation to me;" and a&s;k him in the &s;ame &s;olemn manner to ble&s;s all the gra&s;p|ing means you intend to make u&s;e of in the day, to add to your &s;ub&s;tance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worthy, I have no patience with you for thinking I could be &s;o wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me out, Mr. Bragwell; you turned your good nephew, Tom Broad, out of doors, you know; you owned to me it was an act of inju&s;tice. Now &s;uppo&s;e on the morning of your doing &s;o you had begged of God in a &s;olemn act of prayer, to pro&s;per the deed of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, which you intended to commit that day. I &s;ee you are &s;hocked at the thought of &s;uch a prayer. Well, then, would not hearty prayer have kept you from commit|ting that wicked action? In &s;hort, what a life mu&s;t that be, no act of which you dare beg God to pro&s;per and ble&s;s. If once you can bring your&s;elf to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray for God's ble&s;&s;ing on your day's work,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
you will certainly grow careful about pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a day as you may &s;afely a&s;k his ble&s;&s;ing upon. The remark may be carried to &s;ports, diver&s;ions, company. A man, who once takes up the &s;e|rious u&s;e of prayer, will &s;oon find him&s;elf obliged to ab&s;tain from &s;uch diver&s;ions, occupations, and &s;ocieties, as he cannot rea&s;onably de&s;ire that God will ble&s;s to him; and thus he will &s;ee him&s;elf compelled to leave off either the practice or the prayer. Now, Mr. Bragwell, I need not a&s;k you which of the two he that is a real Chri&s;tian will give up, &s;inning or praying.</P>

<P>Mr. Bragwell began to feel that he had not the be&s;t of the argument, and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend. Luckily, however, he was relieved from the dif|ficulty into which the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome an&s;wer mu&s;t have brought him, by finding they were come to the end of their little journey: and he never beheld the Bunch of Grapes, which decorated the Sign of the Golden Lion, with more real &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>MR. BRAGWELL and Mr. Worthy alighted at the Golden Lion. It was market-day: the inn, the yard, the town, was all alive. Mr. Bragwell was quite in his element. Money, company, and good cheer, always &s;et his &s;pirits afloat. He felt him&s;elf the principal man in the &s;cene. He had three great objects in view, the &s;ale of his land, the letting Mr. Worthy &s;ee how
<PB N="74" REF="76">
much he was looked up to by &s;o many &s;ub&s;tantial people, and the &s;hewing the&s;e people what a wi&s;e man his mo&s;t intimate friend, Mr. Worthy, was. It was his way to try to borrow a little credit from every per&s;on, and every thing he was connected with, and by that credit to advance his intere&s;t and increa&s;e his wealth.</P>
<P>The Farmers met in a large room, and while they were tran&s;acting their various concerns, tho&s;e who&s;e pur&s;uits were the &s;ame, naturally herded together. The Tanners were drawn to one corner, by the common intere&s;t which they took in bark and hides. A u&s;eful debate was carrying on at another little table, whether the practice of <HI>&s;owing</HI> wheat or of <HI>planting</HI> it were mo&s;t profitable. Another &s;et were di&s;puting whether hor&s;es or oxen were be&s;t for plows. Tho&s;e who were con|cerned in Canals, &s;ought the company of other Canallers; while &s;ome, who were intere&s;ted in the new bill for Inclo&s;ures, wi&s;ely looked out for &s;uch as knew mo&s;t about wa&s;te lands.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was plea&s;ed with all the&s;e &s;ub|jects, and picked up &s;omething u&s;eful on each. It was a &s;aying of his, that mo&s;t men under&s;tood &s;ome one thing, and that he who was wi&s;e would try to learn from every man &s;omething on the &s;ubject he be&s;t knew; but Mr. Worthy made a further u&s;e of the whole. What a pity is it, &s;aid he, that Chri&s;tians are not as de&s;irous to turn their time to good account as men of bu&s;ine&s;s are! When &s;hall we &s;ee religious per&s;ons as anxious to derive profit from the experience of
<PB N="75" REF="77">
others, as the&s;e Farmers? When &s;hall we &s;ee them as eager to turn their time to good account? While I approve the&s;e men for not being <HI>&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> let me improve the hint, by being al&s;o <HI>&s;ervent in &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>Shewing how much <HI>wi&s;er the children of this generation are than the children of light.</HI></P>
<P>When the hurry was a little over, Mr. Brag|well took a turn on the Bowling-green. Mr. Worthy followed him, to a&s;k why the &s;ale of the e&s;tate was not brought forward. Let the Auc|tioneer proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid he; the com|pany will be glad to get home by day-light. I &s;peak mo&s;tly with a view to others, for I do, not think of being a purcha&s;er my&s;elf.&mdash;I know it, &s;aid Bragwell, or I would not be &s;uch a fool as to let the cat out of the bag. But is it really po&s;&s;ible (proceeded he, with a &s;mile of contempt) that you &s;hould think I will &s;ell my e&s;tate before dinner? Mr. Worthy, you are a clever man at books, and &s;uch things; and perhaps can make out an account on paper in a hand&s;omer manner than I can; but I never found much was to be got by fine writing. As to figures, I can carry enough of them in my head to add, divide, and multiply, more money than your learning will ever give you the fingering of. You may beat me at a book, but you are a very child at a bar|gain. Sell my land before dinner, indeed!</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was puzzled to gue&s;s how a man was to &s;hew more wi&s;dom by &s;elling a piece of ground at one hour than at another, and de&s;ired
<PB N="76" REF="78">
an explanation. Bragwell felt rather more con|tempt for his under&s;tanding than he had ever done before. Look'ee, Mr. Worthy, &s;aid he, I do not know that knowledge is of any u&s;e to a man unle&s;s he has &s;en&s;e enough to turn it to account. Men are my books, Mr. Worthy, and it is by reading, &s;pelling, and putting them together to good purpo&s;e, that I have got up in the world. I &s;hall give you a proof of this to-day. The&s;e Farmers are mo&s;t of them come to the Lion with a view of purcha&s;ing this bit of land of mine, if they &s;hould like the bargain. Now, as you know a thing can't be any great bargain both to the buyer and the &s;eller too, to them and to me, it becomes me, as a man of &s;en&s;e, who has the good of his family at heart, to &s;ecure the bargain to my&s;elf. I would not cheat any man, Sir, but I think it fair enough to turn his weakne&s;s to my own advantage; there is no law again&s;t that, you know; and this is the u&s;e of one man's having more &s;en&s;e than another. So, whenever I have a bit of land to &s;ell, I always give a hand&s;ome dinner, with plenty of punch and &s;trong beer. We fill up the morning with other bu&s;ine&s;s, and I carefully keep back any talk about the purcha&s;e till we have dined. At dinner we have, of cour&s;e, a bit of politics. This puts mo&s;t of us into a pa&s;&s;ion, and you know anger is thir&s;ty. Be&s;ides, "Church and King," naturally bring on a good many other toa&s;ts. Now, as I am Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t, you know, it would be &s;habby in me to &s;ave my liquor, &s;o I pu&s;h about the gla&s;s one
<PB N="77" REF="79">
way, and the tankard the other, till all my com|pany are as merry as kings. Every man is de|lighted to &s;ee what a fine hearty fellow he has to deal with, and Mr. Bragwell receives a thou&s;and compliments. By this time they have gained as much in good humour as they have lo&s;t in &s;ober judgment, and this is the proper moment for &s;etting the Auctioneer to work, and this I commonly do to &s;uch good purpo&s;e, that I go home with my pur&s;e a &s;core or two of pounds heavier than if they had not been warmed by their dinner. In the morning men are cool and &s;u&s;picious, and have all their wits about them; but a chearful gla&s;s cures all di&s;tru&s;t. And, what is lucky, I add to my credit as well as my pocket, and get more prai&s;e for my dinner, than blame for my bargain.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was &s;truck with the ab&s;urd vanity which could tempt a man to own him&s;elf guilty of an unfair action for the &s;ake of &s;hewing his wi&s;dom. He was beginning to expre&s;s his di&s;|approbation, when they were told dinner was on table. They went in, and were &s;oon &s;eated. All was mirth and good cheer. Every body agreed that no one gave &s;uch hearty dinners as Mr. Bragwell. Nothing was pitiful where he was Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t. Bragwell, who looked with plea&s;ure on the excellent dinner before him, and enjoyed the good account to which he &s;hould turn it, heard their prai&s;es with delight, and ca&s;t an eye on Worthy, as much as to &s;ay, Who is the wi&s;e man now? Having a mind, for his own
<PB N="78" REF="80">
credit, to make his friend talk, he turned to him, &s;aying, Mr. Worthy, I believe no people in the world enjoy life more than men of our cla&s;s. We have money and power, we live on the fat of the land, and have as good a right to gentility as the be&s;t.</P>
<P>As to gentility, Mr. Bragwell, replied Wor|thy, I am not &s;ure that this is among the wi&s;e&s;t of our preten&s;ions. But I will &s;ay, that ours is a creditable and re&s;pectable bu&s;ine&s;s. In ancient times, Farming was the employment of Princes and Patriarchs; and, now-a-days, an hone&s;t humane, &s;en&s;ible, Engli&s;h yeoman, I will be bold to &s;ay, is not only a very u&s;eful, but an honourable character. But then, he mu&s;t not merely think of <HI>enjoying life,</HI> as you call it, but he mu&s;t think of living up to the great ends for which he was &s;ent into the world. A Wealthy Farmer not only has it in his power to live well, but to do much good. He is not only the fa|ther of his own family, but of his workmen, his dependants, and the poor at large, e&s;pecially in the&s;e hard times. He has it in his power to rai&s;e into credit all the pari&s;h offices which have fallen into di&s;repute, by getting into bad hands; and he can convert, what have been fal&s;ely thought mean offices, into very important ones, by his ju&s;t and Chri&s;tian-like manner of filling them. An up|right juryman, a con&s;cientious Con&s;table, a hu|mane Over&s;eer, an independent Elector, an active Superintendant of a Work-hou&s;e, a ju&s;t Arbitrator in public di&s;putes, a kind Coun&s;ellor
<PB N="79" REF="81">
in private troubles; &s;uch a one, I &s;ay, fills up a &s;tation in &s;ociety no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; and, as far as it reaches, &s;carcely le&s;s important than that of a Magi&s;trate, a Sheriff of a County, or even a Member of Parliament. That can never be a &s;light or a degrading office, on which the hap|pine&s;s of a whole pari&s;h may depend.</P>
<P>Bragwell, who thought the good &s;en&s;e of his friend reflected credit on him&s;elf, encouraged Worthy to go on, but he did it in his own vain way. Aye, very true, Mr. Worthy &s;aid he, you are right; a leading man in our cla&s;s ought to be looked up to as an example, as you &s;ay; in order to which, he &s;hould do things hand&s;omely and liberally, and not grudge him&s;elf, or his friends, any thing, ca&s;ting an eye of complacency on the good dinner he had provided. True, re|plied Mr. Worthy, he &s;hould be an example of &s;implicity, &s;obriety, and plainne&s;s of manners. But he will do well, added he, not to affect a frothy gentility, which will &s;et but clum&s;ily upon him. If he has money, let him &s;pend prudently, lay up moderately for his children, and give libe|rally to the poor. But let him rather &s;eek to dignify his own &s;tation, by his virtues, than to get above it by his vanity. If he acts thus, then, as long as this country la&s;ts, a Farmer of England will be looked upon as one of its mo&s;t valuable members; nay more, by this conduct he may contribute to make England la&s;t the longer. The riches of the Farmer, corn and cattle, are the true riches of a nation; but let
<PB N="80" REF="82">
him remember, that though corn and cattle <HI>en|rich</HI> a country, nothing but ju&s;tice integrity, and religion, can <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> it.</P>
<P>Young Wil&s;on, the worthy grazier, whom Mi&s;s Bragwell had turned off becau&s;e he did not under&s;tand French dances, thanked Mr. Worthy for what he had &s;aid, and hoped he &s;hould be the better for it as long as he lived, and de&s;ired his leave to be better acquainted. Mo&s;t of the others declared they had never heard a finer &s;peech, and then, as is u&s;ual, proceeded to &s;hew the good effect it had on them, by loo&s;e conver|&s;ation, hard drinking, and whatever could coun|teract all that Worthy had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was much concerned to hear Mr. Bragwell, after dinner, whi&s;per to the waiter, to put le&s;s and le&s;s water into every fre&s;h bowl of punch.&mdash;This was his way; if the time they had to &s;it was long, then the punch was to be weaker, as he &s;aw no good in wa&s;ting money to make it &s;tronger than the time required. But if time pre&s;&s;ed, then the &s;trength was to be encrea&s;ed in due proportion, as a &s;mall quantity mu&s;t then intoxicate them as much in a &s;hort time as would be required of a greater quantity had the time been longer. This was one of Mr. Bragwell's nice calculations, and this was the &s;ort of &s;kill on which he &s;o much valued him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At length the gue&s;ts were properly primed for bu&s;ine&s;s; ju&s;t in that convenient &s;tage of intoxi|cation which makes men warm and ra&s;h, yet keeps &s;hort of that ab&s;olute drunkenne&s;s, which
<PB N="81" REF="83">
di&s;qualifies for bu&s;ine&s;s. The Auctioneer &s;et to work. All were bidders, and, if po&s;&s;ible, all would have been purcha&s;ers, &s;o happily had the fea&s;t and the punch operated. They bid on with a &s;till increa&s;ing &s;pirit, till they had got &s;o much above the value of the land, that Bragwell, with a wink and a whi&s;per, &s;aid, Who would &s;ell his land fa&s;ting? Eh! Worthy? At length the e&s;tate was knocked down, at a price very far above its worth.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was &s;old, Bragwell again &s;aid &s;oftly to Worthy, Five from fifty, and there re|main forty five. The dinner and drink won't co&s;t me five pounds, and I have got fifty more than the land was worth. Spend a &s;hilling to gain a pound, this is what I call practical Arith|metic, Mr. Worthy.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was glad to get out of this &s;cene; and &s;eeing that his friend was quite &s;ober, he re|&s;olved, as they rode home, to deal plainly with him. Bragwell had found out, among his cal|culations, that there were &s;ome &s;ins which could only be committed, by a prudent man, one at a time. For in&s;tance, he knew that a man could not well get rich, and get drunk, at the &s;ame moment, &s;o that he u&s;ed to practice one fir&s;t, and the other after; but he had found out that &s;ome vices made very good company together; thus, while he had watched him&s;elf in drinking, le&s;t he &s;hould become as unfit to &s;ell, as his gue&s;ts were to buy, he had indulged, without mea&s;ure, in the good dinner he had provided. Mr. Wor|thy,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
I &s;ay, &s;eeing him able to bear rea&s;on, re|buked him for this day's proceedings, with &s;ome &s;everity, Bragwell bore his reproofs with that &s;ort of patience which ari&s;es from an opinion of one's own wi&s;dom, and a recent flu&s;h of pro&s;|perity. He behaved with that gay, good hu|mour which grows out of vanity and good luck. You are too &s;queami&s;h, Mr. Worthy, &s;aid he, I have done nothing di&s;creditable. The&s;e men came with their eyes open. There is no com|pul&s;ion u&s;ed. They are free to bid, or to let it alone. I make them welcome, and I &s;hall not be thought a bit the wor&s;e of by them, to-mor|row, when they are &s;ober. Others do it be&s;ides me, and I &s;hall never be a&s;hamed of any thing, as long as I have cu&s;tom on my &s;ide.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry, Mr. Bragwell, to hear you &s;upport &s;uch practices by &s;uch arguments. There is not, perhaps, a more dangerous &s;nare to the &s;ouls of men than is to be found in that word CUSTOM. It is a word invented to recon|cile corruption with credit, and &s;in with &s;afety. But no cu&s;tom, no fa&s;hion, no combination of men, to &s;et up a fal&s;e &s;tandard, can ever make a wrong action right. That a thing is often done, is &s;o far from a proof of its being right, that it is the very rea&s;on which will &s;et a thinking man to inquire if it be not really wrong, le&s;t he &s;hould be following "a multitude to do evil." Right is right, though only one man in a thou&s;and pur|&s;ues it, and wrong will be for ever wrong, though it be the allowed practice of the other nine hun|dred
<PB N="83" REF="85">
and ninety-nine. If this &s;hameful cu&s;tom is really common, which I can hardly believe, that is a fre&s;h rea&s;on why a con&s;cientious man &s;hould &s;et his face again&s;t it. And I mu&s;t go &s;o far as to &s;ay, (you will excu&s;e me, Mr. Bragwell,) that I &s;ee no great difference, in the eye of con|&s;cience, whatever there may be in the eye of law, between your making a man fir&s;t lo&s;e his rea&s;on, and then getting fifty guineas out of his pocket, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he has lo&s;t it; and your picking the fifty guineas out of his pocket, if you had met him dead drunk in his way home to-night. Nay, he who meets a man already drunk and robs him, commits but one &s;in, while he who makes him drunk fir&s;t, that he may rob him afterwards, commits two.</P>
</SP>
<P>Bragwell gravely replied, Mr. Worthy, while I have the practice of people of credit to &s;upport me, and the law of the land to protect me, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of any thing I do.&mdash;Mr. Bragwell, an&s;wered Worthy, a truly hone&s;t man is not always looking &s;harp about him, to &s;ee how far cu&s;tom and the law will bear him out; if he be hone&s;t on principle he will con&s;ult the law of his con&s;cience, and if he be a Chri&s;tian, he will con&s;ult the written law of God.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this rebuff, Mr. Bragwell got home in high &s;pirits, for no arguments could hinder him from feeling that he had the fifty guineas in his pur&s;e. As &s;oon as he came in, he gaily threw the money he had received on the table, and de&s;ired his wife to lock it up. In&s;tead
<PB N="84" REF="86">
of receiving it with her u&s;ual &s;atisfaction, &s;he bur&s;t into a violent fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and threw it back to him. You may keep your ca&s;h your&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he. It is all over: we want no more money. You are a ruined man! A wicked creature, &s;craping and working as we have done for her! Bragwell trembled, but dur&s;t not a&s;k what he dreaded to hear. His wi&s;e &s;pared him the trouble, by crying out, as &s;oon as her rage per|mitted, Polly is gone off! Poor Bragwell's heart &s;unk within him; he grew &s;ick and giddy, and as his wife's rage &s;wallowed up her grief, &s;o, in his grief, he almo&s;t forgot his anger. The pur&s;e fell from his hand, and he ca&s;t a look of angui&s;h upon it, finding, for the fir&s;t time, that money could not relieve his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who, though much concerned, was le&s;s di&s;compo&s;ed, now called to mind, that the young lady had not returned with her mother and &s;i&s;ter the night before: he begged Mrs. Bragwell to explain this &s;ad &s;tory. She, in&s;tead of &s;oothing her hu&s;band, fell to reproaching him. It is all your fault, &s;aid &s;he, you were a fool for your pains. If I had had my way, the girls never would have kept company with any but men of &s;ub&s;tance, and then they could not have been ruined. Mrs. Bragwell, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, if &s;he has cho&s;en a bad man, it would be &s;till a misfortune, even though he had been rich. O, that would alter the ca&s;e, &s;aid &s;he; a <HI>fat &s;orrow is better than a lean one.</HI> But to marry a beggar! there is no &s;in like that. Here Mi&s;s Bet&s;y, who
<PB N="85" REF="87">
&s;tood &s;ullenly by, put in a word, and &s;aid, her &s;i&s;ter, however, had not di&s;graced her&s;elf by having married a Farmer or a Trade&s;man, &s;he had, at lea&s;t, made choice of a Gentleman. What marriage! what Gentleman! cried the afflicted father. Tell me the wor&s;t! He was now informed that his darling daughter was gone off with a &s;trolling player, who had been acting in the neighbouring villages lately. Mi&s;s Bet&s;y again put in, &s;aying, he was no &s;troller, but a gentleman in di&s;gui&s;e, who only acted for his own diver&s;ion. Does he &s;o? &s;aid the now furi|ous Bragwell, then he &s;hall be tran&s;ported for mine. At this moment a letter was brought him from his new &s;on-in-law, who de&s;ired his leave to wait upon him, and implore his forgivene&s;s. He owned he had been &s;hopman to a haber|da&s;her, but thinking his per&s;on and talents ought not to be thrown away upon trade, and being al&s;o a little behind hand, he had taken to the &s;tage with a view of making his fortune. That he had married Mi&s;s Bragwell entirely for love, and was &s;orry to mention &s;o paltry a thing as money, which he de&s;pi&s;ed, but that his wants were pre&s;&s;ing; his landlord, to whom he was in debt, having been &s;o vulgar as to threaten to &s;end him to pri&s;on. He ended with &s;aying, I have been obliged to &s;hock your daughter's deli|cacy, by confe&s;&s;ing my unlucky real name; I believe I owe part of my &s;ucce&s;s with her to my having a&s;&s;umed that of Augu&s;tus Frederic Theo|do&s;ius. She is incon&s;olable at this confe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="86" REF="88">
which, as you are now my father, I mu&s;t al&s;o make to you, and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf with many blu&s;hes, by the vulgar name of your dutiful &s;on, TIMOTHY INCLE.</P>
<P>O, cried the afflicted father, as he tore the let|ter in a rage, Mi&s;s Bragwell married to a &s;trol|ling actor! How &s;hall I bear it? Why, I would not bear it at all, cried the enraged mother, I would never &s;ee her, I would never forgive her. I would let her &s;tarve at one corner of the barn, while that ra&s;cal, with all tho&s;e Pagan, Popi&s;h, names, was ranting away at the other. Nay, &s;aid Mi&s;s Bet&s;y, if he is only a &s;hopman, and if his name be really Timothy Incle, I would never forgive her neither. But who would have thought it by his looks, and by his mon&s;trous genteel behaviour? no, he never can have &s;o vulgar a name.</P>
<P>Come, come, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, were he really an hone&s;t haberda&s;her, I &s;hould think there was no other harm done, except the di&s;obedience of the thing. Mr. Bragwell, this is no time to blame you, or hardly to rea&s;on with you. I feel for you &s;incerely. I ought not, perhaps, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent, to reproach you for the mi&s;taken manner in which you have bred up your daugh|ters, as your error has brought its puni&s;hment along with it. You now &s;ee, becau&s;e you now feel the evil of a fal&s;e education. It has ruined your daughter; your whole plan unavoidably led to &s;ome &s;uch end. The large &s;ums you &s;pent to qualify them, as you thought, for a high &s;ta|tion,
<PB N="87" REF="89">
could do them nothing but harm, while your habits of life properly confined them to company of a lower &s;tation. While they were better dre&s;t than the daughters of the fir&s;t gentry, they were wor&s;e taught, as to real knowledge, than the daughters of your plowmen. Their vanity has been rai&s;ed by exce&s;&s;ive finery, and kept alive by exce&s;&s;ive flattery. Every evil temper has been fo&s;tered by indulgence. Their pride has never been controuled; their &s;elf-will has never been &s;ubdued. Their idlene&s;s has laid them open to every temptation, and their abun|dance has enabled them to gratify every de&s;ire. Their time, that precious talent, has been en|tirely wa&s;ted. Every thing they have been taught to do is of no u&s;e, while they are utterly unac|quainted with all which they ought to have known. I deplore Mi&s;s Polly's fal&s;e &s;tep. That &s;he &s;hould have married a run-away &s;hopman, turned &s;troller, I truly lament. But, for what hu&s;band was &s;he qualified? For the wife of a Farmer &s;he was too idle. For the wife of a Trade&s;man &s;he was too expen&s;ive. For the wife of a Gentleman &s;he was too ignorant. You your&s;elf was mo&s;t to blame. You expected her to act wi&s;ely, though you never taught her that <HI>fear of God which is the beginning of wi&s;dom.</HI> I owe it to you, as a friend, and to my&s;elf as a Chri&s;tian, to declare, that your practices in the common tran&s;actions of life, as well as your pre&s;ent misfortune, are almo&s;t the natural con|&s;equences

<P>Mrs. Bragwell attempted &s;everal times to in|terrupt Mr. Worthy, but her hu&s;band would not permit it. He felt the force of all his friend &s;aid, and encouraged him to proceed. Mr. Worthy thus went on. It grieves me to &s;ay how much your own indi&s;cretion has contributed even to bring on your pre&s;ent misfortune. You gave your countenance to this very company of &s;trol|lers, though you knew they are acting in defiance to the laws of the land, to &s;ay no wor&s;e. They go from town to town, and from barn to barn, &s;tripping the poor of their money, the young of their innocence, and all of their time. Do you remember with how much pride you told me that you had be&s;poke <HI>The Bold Stroke for a Wife,</HI> for the benefit of this very Mr. Frederic Theo|do&s;ius? To this pernicious ribaldry you not only carried your own family, but wa&s;ted I know not how much money in treating your workmen's wives and children, in the&s;e hard times too, when they have &s;carcely bread to eat, or a &s;hoe on their feet. And all this only that you might have the ab&s;urd plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e flattering words, <HI>By De&s;ire of Mr. Bragwell,</HI> &s;tuck up in Print at the Public-hou&s;e, on the Black&s;mith's &s;hed, at the Turnpike-gate, and on the Barn-door.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell acknowledged that his friend's rebuke was but too ju&s;t, and he looked &s;o very
<PB N="89" REF="91">
contrite as to rai&s;e the pity of Mr. Worthy, who, in a mild voice, thus went on. What I have &s;aid is not &s;o much to reproach you with the ruin of one daughter, as from a de&s;ire to &s;ave the other. Let Mi&s;s Bet&s;y go home with me. I do not undertake to be her gaoler, but I will be her friend. She will find in my daughters kind com|panions, and in my wife a prudent guide. I know &s;he will di&s;like us at fir&s;t, but I do not de&s;pair in time of convincing her that a &s;ober, humble, u&s;eful, pious life, is as nece&s;&s;ary to make us happy on earth, as it is to fit us for heaven.</P>
<P>Poor Mi&s;s Bet&s;y, though &s;he declared it would be <HI>frightful dull,</HI> and <HI>mon&s;trous vulgar,</HI> and <HI>di&s;mal melancholy,</HI> yet was &s;he &s;o terrified at the di&s;content and grumbling which &s;he would have to endure at home, that &s;he &s;ullenly con&s;ented. She had none of that filial tenderne&s;s which led her to wi&s;h to &s;tay and &s;ooth and comfort her afflicted father. All &s;he thought about was to get out of the way of her mother's ill humour, and to carry &s;o much finery with her as to fill the Mi&s;s Worthies with envy and re&s;pect. Poor girl! She did not know that envy was a feeling they never indulged; and that fine cloaths was the la&s;t thing to draw their re&s;pect. Mr. Worthy took her home next day. When they reached his hou&s;e, they found there young Wil&s;on, Mi&s;s Bet&s;y's old admirer. She was much plea&s;ed at this, and re&s;olved to treat him well. But her good or ill treatment now &s;ignified but little. This young Grazier reverenced Mr. Worthy's
<PB N="90" REF="92">
character, and ever &s;ince he had met him at the Lion, had been thinking what a happine&s;s it would be to marry a young woman bred up by &s;uch a father. He had heard much of the mode&s;ty and di&s;cretion of both the daughters, but his incli|nation now determined him in favour of the elder.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who knew him to be a young man of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ound principles, allowed him to become a vi&s;itor at his hou&s;e, but deferred his con&s;ent to the marriage till he knew him more thoroughly. Mr. Wil&s;on, from what he &s;aw of the dome&s;tic piety of this family, improved daily both in the knowledge and practice of religion, and Mr. Worthy &s;oon formed him into a mo&s;t valua|ble character. During this time Mi&s;s Bragwell's hopes had revived, but though &s;he appeared in a new dre&s;s almo&s;t every day, &s;he had the mortifica|tion of being beheld with great indifference by one whom &s;he had always &s;ecretly liked. Mr. Wil&s;on married before her face a girl who was greatly her inferior in fortune, per&s;on, and appearance, but who was humble, frugal, meek, and pious. Mi&s;s Bragwell now &s;trongly felt the truth of what Mr. Wil&s;on had once told her, that a woman may make an excellent partner for a dance, who would make a very bad one for life.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Bragwell and his daughters had only learnt to regret their folly and vanity, as it had produced them mortification in this life; whether they were ever brought to a more &s;erious &s;en&s;e of their errors, may be &s;een in a future part of this hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>MR. BRAGWELL was &s;o much afflicted at the di&s;graceful marriage of his daughter, who ran off with Timothy Incle, the &s;trolling-player, that he never fully recovered his &s;pirits. His chearfulne&s;s, which had ari&s;en from an high opi|nion of him&s;elf, had been confirmed by a con|&s;tant flow of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s; and that is a &s;ort of chearfulne&s;s which is very liable to be impaired, becau&s;e it lies at the mercy of every accident and cro&s;s event in life. But though his pride was now di&s;appointed, his misfortunes had not taught him any humility; becau&s;e he had not di&s;covered that they were cau&s;ed by his own fault; nor had he acquired any patience or &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he had not learnt that all afflic|tions come from the hand of God to awaken us to a deep &s;en&s;e of our &s;ins, and to draw off our hearts from the peri&s;hing vanities of this life. Be&s;ides, Mr. Bragwell was one of tho&s;e people, who, even if they would be thought to bear with tolerable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;uch trials as appear to be &s;ent more immediately from Providence, yet think they have a &s;ort of right to rebel at every misfortune which befals them through the fault of a fellow-creature; as if our fellow-creatures were not the agents and in&s;truments by which Providence often &s;ees fit to try or to puni&s;h us.
<PB N="92" REF="94">
This imprudent daughter, Bragwell would not be brought to &s;ee or forgive, nor was the de|grading name of Mrs. Incle ever allowed to be pronounced in his hearing. He had loved her with an exce&s;&s;ive and undue affection; and while &s;he gratified his vanity by her beauty and finery, he deemed her faults of little con&s;equence; but when &s;he di&s;appointed his ambition by a di&s;|graceful marriage, all his natural affection only &s;erved to increa&s;e his re&s;entment. Yet, though he regretted her crime le&s;s than his own morti|fication, he never cea&s;ed in &s;ecret to lament her lo&s;s. She &s;oon found out &s;he was undone, and wrote in a &s;train of bitter repentance to a&s;k his forgivene&s;s. She owned that her hu&s;band, whom &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be a man of fa&s;hion in di&s;|gui&s;e, was a low per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum|&s;tances. She implored that her father, though he refu&s;ed to give her hu&s;band that fortune for which alone it was now too plain he had married her, would at lea&s;t allow her &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for that Mr. Incle was much in debt, and &s;he feared in danger of a gaol. The father's heart was half melted at this account, and his affec|tion was for a time awakened. But Mrs. Brag|well oppo&s;ed his &s;ending her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She always made it a point of duty never to forgive; "for &s;he &s;aid it only encouraged tho&s;e who had done wrong once to do wor&s;e next time. For her part &s;he had never yet been guilty of &s;o mean and pitiful a weakne&s;s as to forgive any one; for to pardon an injury always &s;hewed either
<PB N="93" REF="95">
want of &s;pirit to feel it, or want of power to re&s;ent it. She was re&s;olved &s;he would never &s;quander the money for which &s;he had worked early and late, on a baggage who had thrown her&s;elf away on a beggar, while &s;he had a daugh|ter &s;ingle who might rai&s;e her family by a great match." I am &s;orry to &s;ay that Mrs. Bragwell's anger was not owing to the undutifulne&s;s of the daughter, or the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the hu&s;band; poverty was in her eyes the grand crime. The doctrine of forgivene&s;s, as a religious principle, made no more a part of Mr. Bragwell's &s;y&s;tem than of his wife's, but in natural feeling, parti|cularly for this offending daughter, he much exceeded her.</P>
<P>In a few months, the younge&s;t Mi&s;s Bragwell de&s;ired leave to return home from Mr. Wor|thy's. She had, indeed, only con&s;ented to go thither as a le&s;s evil of the two than &s;taying in her father's hou&s;e after her &s;i&s;ter's elopement. But the &s;obriety and &s;implicity of Mr. Worthy's family were irk&s;ome to her. Habits of vanity and idlene&s;s were become &s;o rooted in her mind, that any degree of re&s;traint was a burthen; and though &s;he was outwardly civil, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that &s;he longed to get away. She re&s;olved, however, to profit by her &s;i&s;ter's faults; and made her parents ea&s;y by a&s;&s;uring them &s;he never would throw her&s;elf away on a <HI>man who was worth nothing.</HI> Encouraged by the&s;e promi&s;es, which were all that her parents thought they
<PB N="94" REF="96">
could in rea&s;on expect, her father allowed her to come home.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who accompanied her, found Mr. Bragwell gloomy and dejected. As his hou&s;e was no longer a &s;cene of vanity and fe&s;ti|vity, Mr. Bragwell tried to make him&s;elf and his friend believe that he was grown religious; whereas he was only become di&s;contented. As he had always fancied that piety was a melan|choly gloomy thing, and as he felt his own mind really gloomy, he was willing to think that he was growing pious. He had, indeed, gone more con&s;tantly to church, and had taken le&s;s plea&s;ure in fea&s;ting and cards, and now and then read a chapter in the Bible; but all this was be|cau&s;e his &s;pirits were low, and not becau&s;e his heart was changed. The outward actions were more regular, but the inward man was the &s;ame. The forms of religion were re&s;orted to as a pain|ful duty; but this only added to his mi&s;ery, while he was utterly ignorant of its &s;pirit and its power. He &s;till, however, re&s;erved religion as a loath|&s;ome medicine, to which he feared he mu&s;t have recour&s;e at la&s;t, and of which he even now con|&s;idered every ab&s;tinence from plea&s;ure, or every exerci&s;e of piety as a bitter do&s;e. His health al&s;o was impaired, &s;o that his friend found him in a pitiable &s;tate, neither able to receive plea|&s;ure from the world, which he &s;o dearly loved, nor from religion which he &s;o greatly feared. He expected to have been much commended by Worthy for the change in his way of life; but
<PB N="95" REF="97">
Worthy, who &s;aw that the alteration was only owing to the lo&s;s of animal &s;pirits, and to the ca&s;ual ab&s;ence of temptation, was cautious of flattering him too much. "I thought, Mr. Worthy," &s;aid he, "to have received more comfort from you. I was told too, that religion was full of comfort, but I do not much find it." You were told the truth, replied Worthy, Reli|gion is full of comfort, but you mu&s;t fir&s;t be brought into a &s;tate fit to receive it before it can become &s;o; you mu&s;t be brought to a deep and humbling &s;en&s;e of &s;in. To give you comfort while you are puffed up with high thoughts of your&s;elf, would be to give you a &s;trong cordial in a high fever. Religion keeps back her cor|dials till the patient is lowered and emptied; emptied of &s;elf, Mr. Bragwell. If you had a wound, it mu&s;t be examined and clean&s;ed, aye, and probed too, before it would be &s;afe to put on a healing plai&s;ter. Curing it to the outward eye, while it was corrupt at bottom, would only bring on a mortification, and you would be a dead man while you tru&s;ted that the plai&s;ter was curing you. You mu&s;t be, indeed, a Chri&s;tian, before you can be entitled to the comforts of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;I am a Chri&s;tian, &s;aid Brag|well, many of my friends are Chri&s;tians, but I do not &s;ee it has done us much good.&mdash;Chri&s;|tianity it&s;elf, an&s;wered Worthy, cannot make us good unle&s;s it be applied to our hearts, Chri&s;tian privileges will not make us Chri&s;tians unle&s;s we make u&s;e of them. On that &s;helf I
<PB N="96" REF="98">
&s;ee &s;tands your medicine. The doctor orders you to take it. <HI>"Have</HI> you taken it?"&mdash;Yes, replied Bragwell. Are you the better for it? &s;aid Worthy.&mdash;I think I am, he replied. &mdash;But, added Worthy, are you the better be|cau&s;e the doctor has ordered it merely, or becau&s;e you have al&s;o taken it?&mdash;What a fool|i&s;h que&s;tion, cried Bragwell. Why, to be &s;ure the doctor might be the be&s;t doctor, and his phy&s;ic the be&s;t phy&s;ic in the world; but if it &s;tood for ever on the &s;helf, I could not expect to be cured by it. My doctor is not a mountebank. He does not pretend to cure by a charm. The phy&s;ic is good, and as it &s;uits my ca&s;e, though it is bitter, I take it.&mdash;You have now, &s;aid Worthy, explained unde&s;ignedly the rea&s;on why Religion does &s;o little good in the world. It is not a mountebank; it does not work by a charm; but offers to cure your wor&s;t corruptions by whole&s;ome, though &s;ometimes bitter pre&s;crip|tions. But you will not take them; you will not apply to God with the &s;ame earne&s;t de&s;ire to be healed with which you apply to your doctor; you will not confe&s;s your &s;ins to the one as ho|ne&s;tly as you tell your &s;ymptoms to the other, nor read your Bible with the &s;ame faith and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion with which you take your medicine. In reading it, however, you mu&s;t take care not to apply to your&s;elf the comforts which are not &s;uited to your ca&s;e. You mu&s;t, by the grace of God, be brought into a condition to be en|titled to the promi&s;es, before you can expect the
<PB N="97" REF="99">
comfort of them. Conviction is not conver|&s;ion; that worldly di&s;content which is the effect of worldly di&s;appointment, is not that <HI>godly &s;orrow which worketh repentance.</HI> Be&s;ides, while you have been pur&s;uing all the gratifications of the world, do not complain that you have not all the comforts of Religion too. Could you live in the full enjoyment of both, <HI>the Bible would not he true.</HI></P>
<P>Bragwell now &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;et about the matter in earn&s;et, but he re&s;olved in his own &s;trength; and, unluckily, the very day Mr. Worthy took leave, there happened to be a grand ball at the next town, on account of the a&s;&s;izes. An a&s;&s;ize-ball is a &s;cene to which gen|tlemen and ladies periodically re&s;ort to celebrate the crimes and calamities of their fellow-crea|tures by dancing and mu&s;ic, and to divert them|&s;elves with fea&s;ting and drinking, while unhappy wretches are receiving &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>To this ball Mi&s;s Bragwell went, dre&s;&s;ed out with a double portion of finery, pouring out on her own head the whole band-box of feathers and flowers her &s;i&s;ter had left behind her. While &s;he was at the ball her father formed many plans of religious reformation; he talked of le&s;&s;ening his bu&s;ine&s;s, that he might have more lei&s;ure for devotion; though not <HI>ju&s;t now,</HI> while the markets were &s;o high; and then he began to think of &s;ending a hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;cription to the infirmary; though, on &s;econd thoughts, he concluded he need not be <HI>in a hurry,</HI> but leave
<PB N="98" REF="100">
it in his will; but to give, and repent, and re|form, were three things he was bent upon. But when his daughter came home at night, &s;o happy and &s;o fine, and telling how &s;he had danced with 'Squire Squeeze the great corn contractor, and how many fine things he had &s;aid to her, Mr. Bragwell felt the old &s;pirit of the world return in its full force. A marriage with Mr. Da&s;hall Squeeze, the contractor, was beyond his hope, for Mr. Squeeze was &s;uppo&s;ed from a very low beginning to have got rich during the war. As for Mr. Squeeze he had picked up as much of the hi&s;tory of his partner between the dances as he de&s;ired; he was convinced there would be no money wanting, for Mi&s;s Bragwell, who was now looked on as an only child, mu&s;t needs be a great fortune, and he was too much u&s;ed to advantage|ous contracts to let this &s;lip. As he was gaudily dre&s;&s;ed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the arts of vulgar flat|tery, Mi&s;s Bragwell eagerly caught at his pro|po&s;al to wait on her father next day. Squeeze was quite a man after Bragwell's own heart, a genius at getting money, a fine da&s;hing fellow at &s;pending it. He told his wife that this was the very &s;ort of man for his daughter, for he got money like a Jew, and &s;pent it like a Prince; but whether it was fairly got, or wi&s;ely &s;pent, he was too much a man of the world to inquire. Mrs. Bragwell was not &s;o run away with by appearances, but &s;he de&s;ired her hu&s;band to be careful and quite &s;ure that it was the right Mr. Squeeze, and no impo&s;tor. But being a&s;&s;ured that Bet&s;ey would
<PB N="99" REF="101">
certainly keep her carriage, &s;he never gave her|&s;elf one thought with what &s;ort of man &s;he was to ride in it. To have one of her daughters drive in her own coach, filled up all her ideas of human happine&s;s. The marriage was celebrated with great &s;plendor, and Mr. and Mrs. Squeeze &s;et off for London, where they had a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell now tried to forget that he had any other daughter, and if &s;ome thoughts of the re&s;olutions he had made of entering on a more religious cour&s;e would &s;ometimes force them|&s;elves upon him, they were put off, like the re|pentance of Felix, <HI>to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on;</HI> and finding he was likely to have a grandchild, he be|came more worldly and ambitious than ever, thinking this a ju&s;t pretence for adding hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field; and there is no &s;trata|gem by which men more deceive them&s;elves than when they make even unborn children a pretence for that rapine, or that hoarding, of which their own covetou&s;ne&s;s is the true motive. When|ever he ventured to write to Mr. Worthy about the wealth, the gaiety, and the grandeur of Mr. and Mrs. Squeeze, that faithful friend hone&s;tly reminded him of the vanity and uncertainty of worldly greatne&s;s, and the error he had been guilty of in marrying his daughter before he had taken time to inquire into the real character of the man, &s;aying, that he could not help foreboding, that the happine&s;s of a match made at a ball might have an end. Notwith&s;tanding, Mr. Bragwell had paid down a larger fortune than
<PB N="100" REF="102">
was prudent, for fear Mr. Squeeze &s;hould fly off, yet he was &s;urpri&s;ed to receive very &s;oon a pre&s;&s;ing letter from him, de&s;iring him to advance a con&s;iderable &s;um, as he had the offer of an advantageous purcha&s;e, which he mu&s;t lo&s;e for want of money. Bragwell was &s;taggered, and refu&s;ed to comply; but his wife told him he mu&s;t not be &s;habby to &s;uch a gentleman as 'Squire Squeeze, for that &s;he heard on all &s;ides &s;uch accounts of their grandeur, their fea&s;ts, their carriages, and their liveries, that &s;he and her hu&s;band ought even to deny them&s;elves comforts to oblige &s;uch a generous &s;on, who did all this in honour of their daughter; be&s;ides, if he did not &s;end the money &s;oon, they might be obliged to lay down their coach, and then &s;he &s;hould never be able to &s;hew her face again. At length Mr. Bragwell lent him the money on his bond: he knew Squeeze's income was large, for he had carefully enquired into this particular, and for the re&s;t he took his word. Mrs. Squeeze al&s;o got great pre&s;ents from her mother, by repre|&s;enting to her how expen&s;ively they were forced to live to keep up their credit, and what honour &s;he was conferring on the family of the Bragwell's by &s;pending their money in &s;uch grand company. Among many other letters &s;he wrote her the following:&mdash;</P>

<P>The &s;tyle of her letters, however, altered in a few months. She owned that though things went on gayer and grander than ever, yet &s;he hardly ever &s;aw her hu&s;band, except her hou&s;e was full of company, and cards, or dancing was
<PB N="102" REF="104">
going on; that he was often &s;o bu&s;y he could not come all night; that he always borrowed the money her mother &s;ent her when he was going out on this nightly bu&s;ine&s;s; and that the la&s;t time &s;he had a&s;ked <HI>him</HI> for money, he cur&s;ed, and &s;wore, and bid her apply to the old farmer and his rib, who were made of money. This letter Mrs. Bragwell concealed from her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>At length, on &s;ome change in public affairs, Mr. Squeeze, who had made an overcharge of &s;ome thou&s;and pounds in one article, lo&s;t his con|tract; he was found to owe a large debt to go|vernment, and his accounts mu&s;t be made up immediately. This was impo&s;&s;ible; he had not only &s;pent his large income without making any provi&s;ion for his family, but had contracted heavy debts by gaming and other vices. His creditors poured in upon him. He wrote to Bragwell to borrow another &s;um; but without hinting at the lo&s;s of his contract. The&s;e repeat|ed demands made Bragwell &s;o unea&s;y, that in|&s;tead offending him the money, he re&s;olved to go him&s;elf &s;ecretly to London, and judge by his own eyes how things were going on, as his mind &s;trangely mi&s;gave him. He got to Mr. Squeeze's hou&s;e about eleven at night, and knocked gently, concluding that they mu&s;t needs be gone to bed. But what was his a&s;toni&s;hment to find the hall was full of men; he pu&s;hed through in &s;pite of them, though to his great &s;urpri&s;e they in&s;i&s;ted on knowing his name. This affronted him: he refu&s;ed, &s;aying; I'am not a&s;hamed of my name,

it will pa&s;s for thou&s;ands in any market in the We&s;t of England. Is this your London man|ners, not to let a man of my credit in without knowing his name indeed! What was his amazement to &s;ee every room as full of card|tables, and of fine gentlemen and ladies as it would hold; all was &s;o light, and &s;o gay, and &s;o fe&s;tive, and &s;o grand, that he reproached him&s;elf for his &s;u&s;picions, thought nothing too good for them, and re&s;olved &s;ecretly to give Squeeze another five hundred pounds to help to keep up &s;o much grandeur and happine&s;s. At length, &s;eeing a footman he knew, he a&s;ked him where were his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, for he could not pick them out among the company; or rather his ideas were &s;o confu&s;ed with the &s;plendour of the &s;cene, that he did not know whether they were there or not.

Mr. Bragwell &s;aid he would go up him&s;elf, and look for his daughter, as he could not &s;peak &s;o freely to her before all that company. He went up and knocked at the chamber door, and its not being opened, made him pu&s;h it with &s;ome violence. He heard a bu&s;tling noi&s;e within, and again made a fruitle&s;s attempt to open the door. At this the noi&s;e increa&s;ed, and Mr. Bragwell was &s;truck to the heart at the found of a pi&s;tol from within. He now kicked &s;o violently again&s;t the door that it bur&s;t open, when the fir&s;t &s;ight he &s;aw was his daughter falling to the ground in a fit, and Mr.

Squeeze dying by a &s;hot from a pi&s;tol which was dropping out of his hand. Mr. Bragwell was not the only per&s;on whom the found of the pi&s;tol had alarmed. The &s;ervants, the company, all heard it, and all ran up to this &s;cene of horror. Tho&s;e who had the be&s;t of the game took care to bring up their tricks in their hands, having had the prudence to leave the very few who could be tru&s;ted, to watch the &s;takes, while tho&s;e who had a pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing, profitted by the confu&s;ion and threw up their cards. All was di&s;may and terror. Some ran for a &s;urgeon, others examined the dying man, while &s;ome re|moved Mrs. Squeeze to her bed, while poor Bragwell could neither &s;ee nor hear, nor do any thing. One of the company took up a letter which lay open upon the table, addre&s;&s;ed to him, they read it, hoping it might explain the horrid my&s;tery. It was as follows:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Fetch home your daughter, I have ruined her, my&s;elf, and the child, to which &s;he every hour expects to be a mother. I have lo&s;t my contract. My debts are immen&s;e. You refu&s;e me money: I mu&s;t die then; but I will die like a man of &s;pirit. They wait to take me to pri|&s;on; I have two executions in my hou&s;e; but I have ten card tables in it. I would die as I have lived. I invited all this company, and have

It has cau&s;ed all my crimes. Whoever is re&s;olved to live beyond his income is liable to every &s;in. He can never &s;ay to him&s;elf, thus far &s;halt thou go and no farther. Vanity led me to commit acts of rapine, that I might live in &s;plendor; vanity makes me commit &s;elf-murder, becau&s;e I will not live in poverty. The new philo&s;ophy &s;ays, that death is an eternal &s;leep; but the new philo&s;ophy lies. Do you take heed: it is too late for me.

<P>The dead body was removed, and Mr. Brag|well remaining almo&s;t without &s;peech, or motion, the company began to think of retiring, much out of humour at having their party &s;o di&s;agree|ably broken up; they comforted them&s;elves, however, that as it were <HI>&s;o early,</HI> for it was now &s;carcely twelve, they could fini&s;h their evening at another party or two; &s;o completely do habits of <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> as it is called, harden the heart, and &s;teel it not only again&s;t virtuous impre&s;&s;ions, but again&s;t natural feelings. Now it was, that tho&s;e who had nightly rioted at the expence of tho&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="108">
wretched people were the fir&s;t to abu&s;e them. Not an offer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance was made to this poor forlorn woman; not a word of kindne&s;s, or of pity, nothing but cen&s;ure was now heard. Why mu&s;t tho&s;e up&s;tarts ape people of quality? though as long as the&s;e up&s;tarts could fea&s;t them, their vulgarity, and their bad character had never been produced again&s;t them. "As long as thou do&s;t well unto thy&s;elf, men &s;hall &s;peak good of thee." One gue&s;t who, unluckily, had no other hou&s;e to go to, coolly &s;aid, as he walked off,&mdash;Squeeze might as well have put off &s;hooting him&s;elf till the morning. It was mon|&s;trous provoking that he could not wait an hour or two.</P>
<P>As every thing in the hou&s;e was &s;eized, Mr. Bragwell prevailed on his mi&s;erable daughter, weak as &s;he was, next morning to &s;et out with him for the country. His acquaintance with polite life was &s;hort, but he had &s;een a great deal in a little time. They had a &s;low and a &s;ad journey. In about a week, Mrs. Squeeze lay-in of a dead child, &s;he her&s;elf langui&s;hed a few days and then died; and the afflicted parents &s;aw the two darling objects of their ambition, for who&s;e &s;akes they had made <HI>too much ha&s;te to be rich,</HI> carried to the land where all things are for|gotten. Mrs. Bragwell's grief, like her other pa&s;&s;ions, was extravagant; and poor Bragwell's &s;orrow was rendered &s;o bitter by &s;elf-reproach, that he would quite have &s;unk under it, had he not thought of his old expedient in di&s;tre&s;s, that
<PB N="107" REF="109">
of &s;ending for Mr. Worthy to comfort him. It was Mr. Worthy's way, to warn people of tho&s;e misfortunes which he &s;aw their faults mu&s;t needs bring on them, but not to reproach, or de&s;ert them when the misfortunes came. He had never been near Bragwell during the &s;hort, but flouri&s;hing, reign of the Squeeze's; for he knew that pro&s;perity made the ears deaf, and the heart hard to good coun&s;el; but as &s;oon as he heard his friend was in trouble he &s;et out to go to him; Bragwell, bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears when he &s;aw him, and when he could &s;peak, &s;aid, This trial is more than I can bear. Mr. Worthy kindly took him by the hand, and when he was a little compo&s;ed, &s;aid, I will tell you a &s;hort &s;tory. There was in ancient times a famous man who was a &s;lave. His ma&s;ter, who was very good to him, one day gave him a bitter melon, and bade him eat it; he eat it up without one word of complaint. How was it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, for you to eat &s;o very nau&s;eous and di&s;agreeable a fruit? The &s;lave replied, My good ma&s;ter, I have received &s;o many favours from your bounty, that it is no wonder if I &s;hould once in my life eat one bitter melon from your hands. This generous an&s;wer &s;o &s;truck the ma&s;ter, that the hi&s;tory, &s;ays he, gave him his liberty. With &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;entiments, my friend, &s;hould man receive his portion of &s;uffer|ings from God, from whom he receives &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings. You in particular have received much
<PB N="108" REF="110">
good at the hand of God, &s;hall you not receive evil al&s;o?</P>
<P>O, Mr. Worthy, &s;aid Bragwell, this blow is too heavy for me, I cannot &s;urvive this &s;hock. I do not de&s;ire it, I only de&s;ire to die. We are very apt to talk mo&s;t of dying when we are lea&s;t fit for it, &s;aid Worthy. This is not the language of that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which makes us pre|pare for death, but of that de&s;pair which makes us out of humour with life. O, Mr. Bragwell, you are indeed di&s;appointed of the grand ends which made life &s;o delightful to you; but till your heart is humbled, till you are brought to a &s;erious conviction of &s;in, till you are brought to &s;ee what is the true end of life, you can have no hope in death. You think you have no bu&s;ine&s;s on earth, becau&s;e tho&s;e for who&s;e &s;ake you too eagerly heaped up riches are no more. But is there not under the canopy of heaven &s;ome afflicted being whom you may yet relieve, &s;ome mode&s;t merit which you may bring forward, &s;ome helple&s;s creature you may &s;ave by your advice, &s;ome peri&s;hing chri&s;tian you may &s;u&s;tain by your wealth? When you have no &s;ins of your own to repent of, no mercies of God to be thankful for, no mi&s;eries of others to relieve, then, and not till then, I con&s;ent you &s;hould &s;ink down in de&s;pair, and call on death to relieve you.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy attended his afflicted friend to the funeral of his unhappy daughter and her babe. The &s;olemn &s;ervice, the committing his late gay

and beautiful daughter to darkne&s;s, to worms, and to corruption, the &s;ight of the dead infant, for who&s;e &s;ake he had re&s;umed ail his &s;chemes of vanity and covetou&s;ne&s;s, when he thought he had got the better of them, the melancholy convic|tion that all human pro&s;perity ends in <HI>in a&s;hes to a&s;hes and du&s;t to du&s;t,</HI> had brought down Mr. Bragwell's &s;elf &s;ufficient and haughty &s;oul into &s;omething of that humble frame in which Mr. Worthy had wi&s;hed to &s;ee it. As &s;oon as they returned home he was beginning to &s;eize the fa|vourable moment for fixing the&s;e &s;erious im|pre&s;&s;ions, when they were un&s;ea&s;onably inter|rupted by the pari&s;h officer, who came to a&s;k Mr. Bragwell what he was to do with a poor dying woman who was travelling the country with her child, and was taken in a fit under the church-yard wall? At fir&s;t they thought &s;he was dead, &s;aid the man, but finding &s;he &s;till breathed, they have carried her into the workhou&s;e till &s;he could give &s;ome account of her&s;elf. Mr. Brag|well was impatient at the interruption, which was indeed un&s;ea&s;onable, and told the man he was at that time too much overcome by &s;orrow to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, but he would give him an an&s;wer to-morrow. But my friend, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, the poor woman may die to-night; your mind is indeed not in a frame for worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, but there is no &s;orrow too great to for|bid our attending the calls of duty. An act of chri&s;tian charity will not di&s;turb but improve the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of your &s;pirit, and though you
<PB N="110" REF="112">
cannot dry your own tears, God may, in great mercy, permit you to dry tho&s;e of another. This may be one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions for which I told you life was worth keeping. Do let us &s;ee this woman. Bragwell was not in a &s;tate either to content or refu&s;e, and his friend drew him to the workhou&s;e, about the door of which &s;tood a crowd of people. She is not dead, &s;aid one, &s;he moves her head. But &s;he wants air, &s;aid they all, while they all, according to cu&s;tom, pu&s;hed &s;o clo&s;e upon her that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould get any. A fine boy of two or three years old &s;tood by her, crying, Mammy is dead, mammy is &s;tarved. Mr. Worthy made up to the poor woman, holding his friend by the arm: in order to give her air he untied a large black bonnet which hid her face, when Mr. Bragwell, at that moment ca&s;ting his eyes on her, &s;aw in this poor &s;tranger the face of his own run-away daughter, Mrs. Incle. He groaned, but could not &s;peak, and as he was turning away to conceal his angui&s;h, the little boy fondly caught hold of his hand, li&s;ping out&mdash;O &s;tay, and give mammy &s;ome bread. His heart yearned towards the child, he gra&s;ped his little hand in his, while he &s;orrow|fully &s;aid to Mr. Worthy, It is too much, &s;end away the people. It is my dear naughty child, <HI>my puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear.</HI> Mr. Worthy de&s;ired the people to go and leave the &s;tranger to them; but by this time &s;he was no &s;tranger to any of them. Pale and meagre as was her face, and poor and &s;habby as was her
<PB N="111" REF="113">
dre&s;s, the proud and flaunting Mi&s;s Polly Brag|well was ea&s;ily known by every one pre&s;ent. They went away, but with the mean revenge of little minds, they paid them&s;elves by abu&s;e, for all the airs and in&s;olence they had once endured from her. Pride mu&s;t have a fall, &s;aid one. I remember when &s;he was too good to &s;peak to a poor body, &s;aid another; where are her flounces and her furbelows now? It is come home to her at la&s;t. Her child looks as if he would be glad of the wor&s;t bit &s;he formerly denied us.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Bragwell had &s;unk in an old wicker chair which &s;tood behind, and groaned out. Lord forgive my hard heart! Lord &s;ubdue my proud heart, "create a clean heart, O God, and renew a right &s;pirit within me." This was perhaps the fir&s;t word of genuine prayer he had ever offered up in his whole life. Worthy overheard it, and his heart rejoiced, but this was not a time for talking, but doing. He a&s;ked Bragwell what was to be done with the unfortu|nate woman, who now &s;eemed to recover fa&s;t, but &s;he did not &s;ee them, for they were behind. She embraced her boy, and faintly &s;aid, my child what &s;hall we do? <HI>I will ari&s;e and go to my father, and &s;ay unto him, father I have &s;inned again&s;t hea|ven and before thee.</HI> This was a joyful &s;ound to Mr. Worthy, who began to hope that her heart might be as much changed for the better as her circum&s;tances were altered for the wor&s;e, and he valued the goods of fortune &s;o little, and contri|tion of &s;oul &s;o much, that he began to think the
<PB N="112" REF="114">
change on the whole might be a happy one. The boy then &s;prung from his mother and ran to Bragwell, &s;aying, Do be good to mammy. Mrs, Incle looking round, now perceived her father; &s;he fell at his feet, &s;aying, O forgive your guilty child, and &s;ave your innocent one from &s;tarving. Bragwell &s;unk down by her, and prayed God to forgive both her and him&s;elf in terms of genuine &s;orrow. To hear words of real penitence and heart-felt prayer from this once high-minded fa|ther and vain daughter, was mu&s;ic to Worthy's ears, who thought this moment of outward mi&s;ery was the only joyful one he had ever &s;pent in the Bragwell family. He was re&s;olved not to inter|fere, but to let the father's own feelings work out the way in which he was to act. Bragwell &s;aid nothing, but &s;lowly led to his own hou&s;e, hold|ing the little boy by the hand, and pointing to Worthy to a&s;&s;i&s;t the feeble &s;teps of his daughter, who once more entered her father's doors; but the dread of &s;eeing her mother quite overpowered her. Mrs. Bragwell's heart was not changed, but &s;orrow had weakened her powers of re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he rather &s;uffered her daughter to come in, than gave her a kind reception. She was more a&s;toni&s;hed than plea&s;ed; and, even in this trying moment, was more di&s;gu&s;ted with the little boy's mean cloaths, than delighted with his ro&s;y face. As &s;oon as &s;he was a little recovered, Mr. Brag|well de&s;ired his daughter to tell him how &s;he hap|pened to be at that place ju&s;t at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">

<HEAD>PART VII.</HEAD>
<P>I LEFT your hou&s;e, my dear father, &s;aid Mrs. Incle, with a heart full of vain triumph. I had no doubt but my hu&s;band was a great man who had put on that di&s;gui&s;e to obtain my hand. Judge then what I felt to find that he was a needy impo&s;tor, who wanted my money but did not care for me. This di&s;covery, though it mortified, did not humble me. I had neither affection to bear with the man who had deceived me, nor religion to improve by the di&s;appoint|ment. I have found that change of circum|&s;tances does not change the heart, till God is plea&s;ed to do it. My misfortunes only taught me to rebel more again&s;t him. I thought God unju&s;t; I accu&s;ed my father, I was envious of my &s;i&s;ter, I hated my hu&s;band; but never once did I blame my&s;elf. My hu&s;band picked up a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by joining him&s;elf to any low &s;cheme of idle plea&s;ure that was going on. He would follow a mountebank, carry a dice-box, or fiddle at a fair. He was always taunting me for that gentility on which I &s;o much valued
<PB N="114" REF="116">
my&s;elf. If I had married a poor working girl, &s;aid he, &s;he could now have got her bread; but a fine lady, without money, is a burthen to her hu&s;band, and a plague to &s;ociety. Every trial which affection might have made lighter, we doubled by animo&s;ity; at length my hu&s;band was detected in u&s;ing fal&s;e dice; he fought with his accu&s;er, both were &s;eized by a pre&s;s-gang, and &s;ent to &s;ea. I was now left to the wide world, and mi&s;erable as I had thought my&s;elf before, I &s;oon found there were higher degrees of mi&s;ery. I was near my time, without bread for my&s;elf, or hope for my child. I &s;et out on foot in &s;earch of the village where I had heard my hu&s;band &s;ay his friends lived. It was a &s;evere trial to my proud heart to &s;loop to tho&s;e low people, but hunger is not delicate, and I was near peri&s;hing. My hu&s;band's parents received me kindly, &s;aying, that though they had nothing but what they earned by their labour, yet I was welcome to &s;hare their hard fare, for they tru&s;ted that God who &s;ent mouths would &s;end meat al&s;o. They gave me a &s;mall room in their cottage, and many nece&s;&s;aries, which they denied them&s;elves.</P>
<P>O, my child, interrupted Bragwell, every word cuts me to the heart. The&s;e poor people gladly gave thee of their little, while thy rich parents le&s;t thee to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I own, continued Mrs. Incle, that all this goodne&s;s could not &s;often my heart, for God had not yet touched it. I received all their kindne&s;s as a favour done to them. When my
<PB N="115" REF="117">
father brought me home any little dainty which he could pick. up, and my mother kindly dre&s;&s;ed it for me, I would not conde&s;cend to eat it with them, but devoured it &s;ullenly in my little gar|ret alone, &s;uffering them to fetch and carry every thing I wanted. As my haughty behaviour was not likely to gain their affection, it was plain they did not love me; and as I had no notion that there were any other motives to good actions but fondne&s;s, or &s;elf-intere&s;t, I was puzzled to know what could make them &s;o kind to me, for of the powerful and con&s;training law of chri&s;tian charity I was quite ignorant. To cheat the weary hours, I looked about for &s;ome books, and found, among a few others of the &s;ame ca&s;t, <HI>Doddridge's Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion in the Soul.</HI> But all tho&s;e books were addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>&s;inners;</HI> now as I knew I was not a &s;inner, I threw them away in di&s;gu&s;t. Indeed they were ill &s;uited to a ta&s;te formed by novels, to which reading I chiefly trace my ruin, for, vain as I was, I &s;hould never have been guilty of &s;o wild a &s;tep as to run away, had not my heart been tainted, and my imagination inflamed, by tho&s;e pernicious books.</P>
<P>At length my little George was born. This added to the burthen I had brought on this poor family, but it did not dimini&s;h their kindne&s;s, and we continued to &s;hare their &s;canty fare with|out any upbraiding on their part, or any grati|tude on mine. Even this poor baby did not &s;often my heart; I wept over him indeed day and night, but they were tears of de&s;pair; I was
<PB N="116" REF="118">
always idle, and wa&s;ted tho&s;e hours in &s;inful murmurs at his fate, which I &s;hould have em|ployed in trying to maintain him. Hard&s;hip, grief, and impatience, at length, brought on a fever. Death &s;eemed now at hand, and I felt a gloomy &s;atisfaction in the thought of being rid of my mi&s;eries, to which I fear was added, a &s;ullen joy to think that you, Sir, and my mother, would be plagued to hear of my death when it would be too late; and in this your grief, I an|ticipated a gloomy &s;ort of revenge. But it plea&s;ed my merciful God not to let me thus peri&s;h in my &s;ins. My poor mother-in-law &s;ent for a good clergyman, who pointed out to me the danger of dying in that hard and unconverted &s;tate &s;o forcibly, that I &s;huddered to find on what a dreadful precipice I &s;tood. He prayed with me, and for me, &s;o earne&s;tly, that at length God, who is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed to magnify his own glory in awakening tho&s;e who are dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, was plea&s;ed, of his free grace, to open my blind eyes, and &s;often my &s;tony heart. I &s;aw my&s;elf a &s;inner, and prayed to be delivered from the wrath of God, in compari&s;on of which the poverty and di&s;grace I now &s;uffered appeared as nothing. To a &s;oul convinced of &s;in, the news of a Redeemer was a joyful found. In&s;tead of reproaching Providence, or blaming my pa|rents, or abu&s;ing my hu&s;band, I now learnt to condemn my&s;elf, to adore that God who had not cut me off in my ignorance, to pray for par|don for the pa&s;t, and grace for the time to come.
<PB N="117" REF="119">
I now de&s;ired to &s;ubmit to penury and hunger in this world, &s;o that I might but live in the fear of God here, and enjoy his favour in the world to come. I now learnt to compare my pre&s;ent light &s;ufferings, the con&s;equence of my own &s;in, with tho&s;e bitter &s;ufferings of my Saviour which he endured for my &s;ake, and I was a&s;hamed of murmuring. But &s;elf-igno|rance, conceit, and vanity, were &s;o rooted in me, that my progre&s;s was very gradual, and I had the &s;orrow to feel, how much the power of long bad habits keeps down the growth of reli|gion in the heart, even after it has begun to take root. I was &s;o ignorant of divine things, that I hardly knew words to frame a prayer; but when I got acquainted with the P&s;alms, I there learnt how to pour out the fulne&s;s of my heart, while in the Go&s;pel I rejoiced to &s;ee what great things God had done for my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I now took down once more from the &s;helf <HI>Doctridge's Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s,</HI> and, oh! with what new eyes did I read it! I now &s;aw clearly, that not only the thief, and the drunkard, the murderer, and the adulterer, are, &s;inners, for that I knew before; but I found that the unbeliever, the &s;elfi&s;h, the proud, the worldly-minded, all, in &s;hort, who live without God in the world, are &s;inners. I did not now apply the reproofs I met with, to my hu&s;band, or my father, or other people, as I u&s;ed to do, but brought them home to my&s;elf. In this book I traced, with &s;trong emotions, and clo&s;e &s;elf-application, the &s;inner
<PB N="118" REF="120">
through all his cour&s;e; his fir&s;t awakening, his convictions, repentance, joys, &s;orrows, back|&s;liding, and recovery, de&s;pondency, and delight, to a triumphant death-bed; and God was plea&s;ed to make it a chief in&s;trument in bringing me to him&s;elf. Here it is, continued Mrs. Incle, untying her little bundle, and taking out a book, accept it, my dear father, and I will pray that God may ble&s;s it to you as He has done to me.</P>
<P>When I was able to come down, I pa&s;&s;ed my time with the&s;e good old people, and &s;oon won their affection. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find they had very good &s;en&s;e, which I never had thought poor people could have; but, indeed, worldly per&s;ons do not know how much religion, while it mends the heart, enlightens the under&s;tanding al&s;o. I now regretted the evenings I had wa&s;ted in my &s;olitary garret, when I might have pa&s;&s;ed them in reading the Bible with the&s;e good folks. This was their refre&s;hing cordial after a weary day, which &s;weetened the pains of want and age. I one day expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize that my unfor|tunate hu&s;band, the &s;on of &s;uch pious parents, &s;hould have turned out &s;o ill: the poor old man &s;aid with tears, I fear we have been guilty of the &s;in of Eli; our love was of the wrong &s;ort. Alas! like him, <HI>we honoured our &s;on more than God,</HI> and God has &s;mitten us for it. We &s;hewed him what was right, but through a fal&s;e indul|gence, we did not correct him for what was wrong. We were blind to his faults. He was a hand&s;ome boy, with &s;prightly parts; we took
<PB N="119" REF="121">
too much delight in tho&s;e outward things. He &s;oon got above our management, and became vain, idle, and extravagant, and when we &s;ought to re&s;train him, it was then too late. We humbled our&s;elves before God; but he was plea&s;ed to make our &s;in become its own puni&s;h|ment. Timothy grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; till he was forced to ab&s;cond for a mi&s;demeanor; after which we never &s;aw him, but have heard of him changing from one idle way of life to an|other, <HI>un&s;table as water:</HI> he has been a foot|man, a &s;oldier, a &s;hopman, and a &s;trolling after. With deep &s;orrow we trace back his vices to our ungoverned fondne&s;s; that lively and &s;harp wit, by which he has been able to carry on &s;uch a variety of wild &s;chemes, might, if we had u&s;ed him to reproof in his youth, have enabled him to have done great &s;ervice for God and his coun|try. But our flattery made him wi&s;e in his own conceit; and there is more hope of a fool than of him. We indulged our own vanity, and have de&s;troyed his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Worthy &s;topped Mrs. Incle, &s;ay|ing, that whenever he heard it lamented that the children of pious parents often turned out &s;o ill, he could not help thinking that there mu&s;t be frequently &s;omething of this &s;ort of error in the bringing them up: he knew, indeed, &s;ome in|&s;tances to the contrary, in which the be&s;t means had failed; but he believed, that from Eli the prie&s;t, to Incle the labourer, more than half the failures of this &s;ort might be traced to &s;ome mi&s;|take,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
take, or vanity, or bad judgment, or &s;inful in|dulgence in the parents.</P>
<P>I now looked about, continued Mrs. Incle, in order to &s;ee in what way I could a&s;&s;i&s;t my poor mother, regretting more heartily than &s;he did, that I knew no one thing that was of any u&s;e. I was &s;o de&s;irous of humbling my&s;elf before God and her, that I offered even to try to wa&s;h. &mdash;You wa&s;h! exclaimed Bragwell, &s;tarting up with great emotion, Heaven forbid that with &s;uch a fortune and education, Mi&s;s Bragwell &s;hould be &s;een at a wa&s;hing-tub. This vain father, who could bear to hear of her di&s;tre&s;&s;es and her &s;ins, could not bear to hear of her wa&s;h|ing. Mr. Worthy &s;topped him, &s;aying, As to her fortune, you know, you refu&s;ed to give her any; and, as to her education, you &s;ee it had not taught her how to do any thing better. I am &s;orry you do not &s;ee, in tin's in&s;tance, the beauty of Chri&s;tian humility. For my own part, I &s;et a greater value on &s;uch an active proof of it, than on a whole volume of profe&s;|&s;ions. Mr. Bragwell did not quite under&s;tand this, and Mrs. Incle went on. What to do to get a penny I knew not. Making of fillagree, or fringe, or card-pur&s;es, or cutting out paper, or dancing and &s;inging, was of no u&s;e in our village. The &s;hopkeeper, indeed, would have taken me, if I had known any thing of accounts; and the clergyman could have got me a nur|&s;ery-maid's place, if I could have done good plain-work. I made &s;ome aukward attempts to
<PB N="121" REF="123">
learn to &s;pin and knit, when my mother's wheel or knitting lay by, but I &s;poilt both through my ignorance. At la&s;t I luckily thought upon the fine netting I u&s;ed to make for my trimmings, and it &s;truck me that I might turn this to &s;ome little account. I procured &s;ome twine, and worked early and late to make nets for fi&s;her|men, and cabbage-nets. I was &s;o plea&s;ed that I had at la&s;t found an opportunity to &s;hew my good-will by this mean work, that I regretted my little George was not big enough to contri|bute his &s;hare to our &s;upport by travelling about to &s;ell my nets.</P>
<P>Cabbage-nets! exclaimed Bragwell; there is no bearing this.&mdash;Cabbage-nets! My grand&s;on hawk cabbage-nets! How could you think of &s;uch a &s;candalous thing?&mdash;Sir, &s;aid Mrs. Incle mildly, I am now convinced that nothing is &s;candalous which is not wicked. Be&s;ides, we were in want; and nece&s;&s;ity, as well as piety, would have reconciled me to this mean trade. Mr. Bragwell groaned, and bade her go on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my little George grew a fine boy; and I adored the goodne&s;s of God, who, in the &s;weetne&s;s of maternal love, had given me a reward for many &s;ufferings. In|&s;tead of indulging a gloomy di&s;tru&s;t about the fate of this child, I now re&s;igned him to the will of God. In&s;tead of lamenting, becau&s;e he was not likely to be rich, I was re&s;olved to bring him up with &s;uch notions as might make him contented to be poor. I thought, if I could
<PB N="122" REF="124">
&s;ubdue all vanity and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in him, I &s;hould make him a happier man than if I had thou&s;ands to be&s;tow on him; and I tru&s;ted, that I &s;hould be rewarded for every painful act of pre&s;ent &s;elf|denial, by the future virtue and happine&s;s of my child. Can you believe it, my dear father, my days now pa&s;t not unhappily? I worked hard all day, and that alone is a &s;ource of happine&s;s beyond what the idle can gue&s;s. After my child was a&s;leep at night, I read a chapter in the Bible to my parents, who&s;e eyes now began to fail them. We then thanked God over our frugal &s;upper of potatoes, and talked over the holy men of old, the faints, and the martyrs, who would have thought our homely fare a luxury. We compared our peace, and liberty, and &s;afety, with their bonds, and impri&s;onment, and tortures; and &s;hould have been a&s;hamed of a murmur. We then joined in prayer, in which my ab&s;ent parents and my hu&s;band were never forgotten, and went to re&s;t in charity with the whole world, and at peace in our own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Oh! my forgiving child! interrupted Mr. Bragwell, &s;obbing, and did&s;t thou really pray for thy unnatural father, and lie down in re&s;t and peace? Then, let me tell thee, thou wa&s;t better off than thy mother and I were.&mdash;But no more of this; go on.</P>
<P>Whether my father-in-law had worked be|yond his &s;trength, in order to &s;upport me and my child, I know not, but he was taken dan|gerou&s;ly ill. While he lay in this &s;tate, we re|ceived
<PB N="123" REF="125">
an account that my hu&s;band was dead in the We&s;t-Indies of the yellow fever, which has carried off &s;uch numbers of our countrymen; we all wept together, and prayed that his awful death might quicken us in preparing for our own. This &s;hock, joined to the fatigue of nur&s;ing her &s;ick hu&s;band, &s;oon brought my poor mother to death's door. I nur&s;ed them both, and felt a &s;atisfaction in giving them all I had to be&s;tow, my attendance, my tears, and my prayers. I, who was once &s;o nice and &s;o proud, &s;o di&s;dainful in the mid&s;t of plenty, and &s;o im|patient under the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience, was now enabled to glorify God by my activity and my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Though the &s;orrows of my heart were enlarged, I ca&s;t my burthen on him who cares for the weary and heavy laden. After having watched by the&s;e poor people the whole night, I &s;at down to breakfa&s;t on my dry cru&s;t and coar&s;e di&s;h of tea, without a murmur; my greate&s;t grief was, left I &s;hould bring away the infection to my dear boy. I prayed to know what it was my duty to do between my dying parents, and my helple&s;s child. To take care of the &s;ick and aged, &s;eemed to be my duty. So I offered up my child to him who is the father of the fatherle&s;s, and he &s;pared him to me.</P>
<P>The chearful piety with which the&s;e good people breathed their la&s;t, proved to me, that the temper of mind with which the pious poor commonly meet death, is the grand compen|&s;ation
<PB N="124" REF="126">
made them by Providence for all the hard|&s;hips of their inferior condition. If they have had few joys and comforts in life already, and have &s;till fewer hopes in &s;tore, is not all fully made up to them by their being enabled to leave this world with &s;tronger de&s;ires of heaven, and without tho&s;e bitter regrets after the good things of this life, which add to the dying tortures of the worldly rich? To the forlorn and de&s;titute death is not terrible, as it is to him who <HI>&s;its at ea&s;e in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> and who fears that this night his &s;oul &s;hall be required of him.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell felt this remark more deeply than his daughter meant he &s;hould. He wept and bade her proceed.</P>
<P>I followed my departed parents to the &s;ame grave, and wept over them, but not as one who had no hope. They had neither hou&s;es nor lands to leave me, but they left me their Bible, their ble&s;&s;ing, and their example, of which I humbly tru&s;t I &s;hall feel the benefits when all the riches of this world &s;hall have an end. Their few effects, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome poor hou&s;ehold goods, and &s;ome working-tools, hardly &s;ufficed to pay their funeral expences. I was &s;oon attacked with the &s;ame fever, and &s;aw my&s;elf, as I thought, dying the &s;econd time; my danger was the &s;ame, but my views were changed. I now &s;aw eter|nity in a more awful light than I had done be|fore, when I wickedly thought death might be gloomily called upon as a refuge from every common trouble. Though I had &s;till rea&s;on to
<PB N="125" REF="127">
be humbled on account of my &s;in, yet, through the grace of God, I &s;aw death &s;hipped of his &s;ting, and robbed of his terrors, <HI>through him, who loved me, and had given him&s;elf for me;</HI> and in the extremity of pain, <HI>my &s;oul rejoiced in God my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>I recovered, however, and was chiefly &s;up|ported by the kind clergyman's charity. When I felt my&s;elf nouri&s;hed and cheered by a little tea or broth, which he daily &s;ent me from his own &s;lender provi&s;ion, my heart &s;mote me, to think how I had daily &s;at down at home to a plentiful dinner, without any &s;en&s;e of thankful|ne&s;s for my own abundance, or without enquir|ing whether my poor &s;ick neighbours were &s;tarv|ing; and I &s;orrowfully remembered, that what my poor &s;i&s;ter and I u&s;ed to wa&s;te through dain|tine&s;s, would now have comfortably fed my&s;elf and child. Believe me, my dear mother, a la|bouring man, who has been brought low by a fever, might often be re&s;tored to his work &s;ome weeks &s;ooner, if on his recovery he was nou|ri&s;hed and &s;trengthened by a good bit from a far|mer's table. Le&s;s than is often thrown to a favourite &s;paniel would &s;uffice, &s;o that the ex|pence would be almo&s;t nothing to the giver, while to the receiver it would bring health, and &s;trength, and comfort.</P>
<P>By the time I was tolerably recovered, I was forced to leave the hou&s;e. I had no human pro&s;pect of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I humbly a&s;ked of God to direct my &s;teps, and to give me entire obe|dience
<PB N="126" REF="128">
to his will. I then ca&s;t my eyes mourn|fully on my child, and though prayer had re|lieved my heart of a load which without it would have been intolerable; my tears flowed fa&s;t, while I cried out in the bitterne&s;s of my &s;oul, <HI>How many hired &s;ervants of my father have bread enough, and to &s;pare, and I peri&s;h with hunger.</HI> This text appeared a kind of an&s;wer to my prayer, and gave me courage to make one more attempt to &s;often you in my favour. I re&s;olved to &s;et out directly to find you, to confe&s;s my di&s;obedience, and to beg a &s;canty pittance, with which I and my child might be meanly &s;upported in &s;ome di&s;tant country, where we &s;hould not di&s;grace our more happy relations. We &s;et out and tra|velled as fa&s;t as my weak health and poor George's little feet and ragged &s;hoes would permit. I brought a little bundle of &s;uch work and nece&s;|&s;aries as I had left, by &s;elling which we &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the road.&mdash;I hope, interrupted Bragwell, there were no cabbage-nets in it?&mdash;At lea&s;t, &s;aid her mother, I hope you did not &s;ell them near home.&mdash;No; I had none left, &s;aid Mrs. Incle, or I &s;hould have done it. I got many a li&s;t in a waggon for my child and my bundle, which was a great relief to me. And here I cannot help &s;aying, I wi&s;h drivers would not be too hard in their demands, if they help a poor &s;ick tra|veller on a mile or two; it proves a great relief to weary bodies and naked feet; and &s;uch little cheap chanties may be con&s;idered as <HI>the cup of cold water,</HI> which, if given on right grounds,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
<HI>&s;hall not lo&s;e its reward.</HI> Here Bragwell &s;ighed, to think that when mounted on his fine bay mare, or driving his neat chai&s;e, it had never once cro&s;&s;ed his mind that the poor way-worn foot traveller was not equally at his ea&s;e, or that &s;hoes were a nece&s;&s;ary accommodation. Tho&s;e who want nothing are apt to forget how many there are who want every thing.&mdash;Mrs. Incle went on: I got to this village about &s;even this evening, and while I &s;at on the church-yard wall to re&s;t and meditate how I &s;hould make my&s;elf known at home, I &s;aw a funeral; I enquired who&s;e it was, and learnt it was my &s;i&s;ter's. This was too much for me. I &s;unk down in a fit, and knew nothing that happened to me from that moment, till I found my&s;elf in the workhou&s;e with my father and Mr. Worthy.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. Incle &s;topped. Grief, &s;hame, pride, and remor&s;e, had quite overcome Mr. Bragwell. He wept like a child; and &s;aid, he hoped his daughter would pray for him, for that he was not in a condition to pray for him&s;elf, though he found nothing el&s;e could give him any com|fort. His deep dejection brought on a fit of &s;ickne&s;s: O! &s;aid he, I now begin to feel an ex|pre&s;&s;ion in the &s;acrament which I u&s;ed to repeat without thinking it had any meaning, the <HI>re|membrance of my &s;ins is grievous, the burthen of them is intolerable.</HI> O, it is awful to think what a &s;inner a man may be, and yet retain a decent character! How many thou&s;ands are in my condition, taking to them&s;elves all the credit of
<PB N="128" REF="130">
their pro&s;perity, in&s;tead of giving God the glory! Heaping up riches to their hurt, in&s;tead of deal|ing their bread to the hungry. O, let tho&s;e who hear of the Bragwell family, never &s;ay that <HI>vanity is a little &s;in.</HI> In <HI>me</HI> it has been the fruitful pa|rent of a thou&s;and &s;ins, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, hardne&s;s of heart, forgetfulne&s;s of God. In one of my &s;ons vanity was the cau&s;e of rapine, inju&s;tice, extra|vagance, ruin, &s;elf-murder. Both my daugh|ters were undone by vanity, though it only wore the more harmle&s;s &s;hape of dre&s;s, idlene&s;s, and di&s;&s;ipation. The hu&s;band of my daughter Incle it de&s;troyed, by leading him to live above his &s;tation, and to de&s;pi&s;e labour. Vanity en&s;nared the &s;ouls even of his pious parents; for while it led them to wi&s;h to &s;ee their &s;on in a better con|dition, it led them to allow him &s;uch indulgences as were unfit for his own. O, you who hear of us, humble your&s;elves under the mighty hand of God; re&s;i&s;t high thoughts; let every imagi|nation be brought into obedience to the Son of God. If you &s;et a value on finery, look into that grave; behold the mouldering body of my Bet&s;y, who now &s;ays to <HI>Corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter.</HI> Look at the bloody and brainle&s;s head of her hu&s;band. O, Mr. Worthy, how does Pro|vidence mock at human fore&s;ight! I have been greedy of gain, that the &s;on of Mr. Squeeze might be a great man; he is dead; while the child of Timothy Incle, whom I had doomed to beggary, will be my heir. Mr. Worthy, to you I com|mit
<PB N="129" REF="131">
this boy's education; teach him to value his immortal &s;oul more, and the good things of this life le&s;s, than I have done. Bring him up in the fear of God, and in the government of his pa&s;|&s;ions. Teach him that unbelief and pride are at the root of all &s;in. I have found this to my co&s;t. I tru&s;ted in my riches; I &s;aid, to-morrow &s;hall be as this day, and more abundant. I did not re|member that <HI>for all the&s;e things God would bring me to judgment.</HI> I am not &s;ure that I believed in a judgment.</P>
<P>Bragwell at length grew better, but he never recovered his &s;pirits. The conduit of Mrs. Incle through life was that of an humble Chri&s;|tian. She &s;old all her &s;i&s;ter's finery, which her father had given her, and gave the money to the poor, &s;aying, it did not become one who profe&s;&s;d penitence, to return to the gaieties of life. Mr. Bragwell did not oppo&s;e this not that he had fully acquired a ju&s;t notion of the &s;elf-denying &s;pirit of religion, but having a head not very clear at making di&s;tinctions, he was never able, after the &s;ight of Squeeze's mangled body, to think of gaiety and grandeur, without thinking at the &s;ame time, of a pi&s;tol and bloody brains, for, as his fir&s;t introduction into gay life had pre&s;ented him with all the&s;e objects at one view, he never afterwards could &s;eparate them in his mind. He even kept his fine beau&s;et of plate aways &s;hut, becau&s;e it brought to his mind the grand unpaid-for &s;ideboard that he had &s;een laid out for. Mr. Squeeze's &s;upper, to the re|membrance
<PB N="130" REF="132">
of which he could not help tacking debts, pri&s;ons, executions, and &s;elf-murder.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell's heart had been &s;o buried in the love of the world, and evil habits were become &s;o rooted in him, that the progre&s;s he made in religion was very &s;low; yet he earne&s;tly prayed and &s;truggled again&s;t vanity; and when his un|feeling wife declared &s;he could not love the boy unle&s;s he was called by their name in&s;tead of Incle, Mr. Bragwell would never con&s;ent, &s;aying, he &s;tood in need of every help again&s;t pride. He al&s;o got the letter which Squeeze wrote ju&s;t before he &s;hot him&s;elf framed and glazed; this he hung up in his chamber, and made it a rule to go and read it as often as he found his heart di&s;po&s;ed to VANITY.</P>
