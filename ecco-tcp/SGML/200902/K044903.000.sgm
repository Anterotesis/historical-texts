<L>THANKS to much Indu&s;try and Pains,</L>
<L>Much twi&s;ting of the Wit and Brains,</L>
<L>Tran&s;lation has unlock'd the Store,</L>
<L>And &s;pread abroad the <HI>Grecian</HI> Lore,</L>

<L>Critic, I hear thy Torrent rage,</L>
<L>"'Tis Bla&s;phemy again&s;t that Stage,</L>

<L>Perfection's but a Word ideal,</L>
<L>And bears about it nothing real,</L>
<L>And Excellence was never hit</L>
<L>In the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays of Man's Wit.</L>

<L>(Be&s;ure I &s;peak of Times of yore)</L>
<L>Than ju&s;t a niggard Light, to mark</L>
<L>How much we all are in the Dark.</L>
<L>As Ru&s;hlights in a &s;pacious Room,</L>

<L>When <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> leads the Mind a Dance,</L>

<L>I own I'm happy in the Chace.</L>
<L>Whether the Drama's here or there,</L>

<L>The Poet's Fancy can create,</L>
<L>Contract, enlarge, annihilate,</L>
<L>Bring pa&s;t and pre&s;ent clo&s;e together,</L>

So, Ladies at a Play, or Rout,</L>
<L>Can flirt the Univer&s;e about,</L>

<L>Yet, when they plea&s;e, contract the Plan,</L>

<LG>
<L>True Genius, like <HI>Armida</HI>'s Wand,</L>
<L>Can rai&s;e the Spring from barren Land.</L>
<L>While all the Art of Imitation,</L>

<L>Tran&s;planting Flowers with u&s;ele&s;s Toil,</L>
<L>Which wither in a foreign Soil.</L>
<L>As Con&s;cience often &s;ets us right,</L>
<L>By its interior active Light,</L>
<L>Without th' A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Laws</L>
<L>To combat in the moral Cau&s;e;</L>
<L>So Genius, of it&s;elf di&s;cerning,</L>

<L>By &s;hifting Dances, left and right.</L>
<L>Not much unlike our modern Notions,</L>
<L>Adagio or Alegro Motions;</L>
<L>To watch upon the deep Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
