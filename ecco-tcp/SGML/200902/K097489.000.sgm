<HEAD>THE Way to be Rich and Re&s;pectable.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ADDRESSED TO MEN of &s;mall FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE great degree of luxury to which this country has arrived, within a few years, is not only a&s;toni&s;hing but almo&s;t dreadful to think of. Time was, when tho&s;e articles of indulgence, which now every mechanic aims at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, were enjoyed only by the Lord or Baron of a di&s;trict. Men were then happy to be the va&s;&s;als or dependants of that Lord, and prided them&s;elves in little but their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and allegiance. This was the &s;tate of things during feudal government: but as, on the increa&s;e of trade, riches in|crea&s;ed; men began to feel new wants, they became gradually le&s;s hardy and robu&s;t, grew effeminate as their property accumulated, and &s;ighed for indulgences they never dreamed of before.&mdash;Methods of conveying the&s;e indul|gencies
<PB N="4" REF="3">from one part of the kingdom to ano|ther were then &s;tudied; roads were made pa&s;|&s;able, and carriages invented.</P>
<P>For many ages coaches were &s;o great a lux|ury, that none but old families were &s;een in them; and if they attempted, once in a dozen years, to travel a few miles in one, perhaps, in the cour&s;e of the journey, a whole village with their teams were called in aid, to drag the heavy vehicle out of the clay, and &s;et it on its wheels again:&mdash; riding on hor&s;eback being the only means of vi&s;iting a neighbour, beyond the reach of a walk, and that only in the &s;ummer-time. And it is but a very few years &s;ince, that ladies went about, from place to place, upon a pil|lion. Made roads were then unknown, and &s;o little de&s;ire had the people to &s;tir, beyond the bounds of their pari&s;h, that even mend|ing them was never thought of.</P>
<P>On the e&s;tabli&s;hment of po&s;ts, a general communication was opened between all parts of the kingdom, and people received intelli|gence of every little improvement that was made: a de&s;ire to in&s;pect tho&s;e improve|ments, gave men an excentric turn; they were eager to &s;ee what was doing at &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="4">di&s;tance from home, and rambled wide for that purpo&s;e. The inconvenience, and indeed impo&s;&s;ibility of travelling, but at certain &s;ea|&s;ons of the year, led the way to the making of roads; making of roads drew thou&s;ands abroad, and a wi&s;h to be thought opulent by tho&s;e whom they vi&s;ited, led them into luxury of dre&s;s. The home&s;pun garb then gave way to more co&s;tly attire, and re&s;pectable plainne&s;s was &s;oon transformed into laughable frippery.</P>
<P>In a few years, refinements took place in manners, and well had it been, were they merely refinements; but the misfortune is, they &s;oon &s;pread into extravagancies, and from being commendable, became objects of cen&s;ure. In the reign of Charles I. luxuries were every where &s;een, and though the Civil Wars for &s;ome time &s;mothered them, they broke out afre&s;h in the reign of Charles II. Wealth then poured in upon the nation; gen|tlemen vied with each in the appearance they made; many by the&s;e means were ruined, e&s;tates changed their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, a fluctuation of property began, and every &s;ucceeding year gave birth to fre&s;h wants and new expences. Luxury however had not then gained its pre|&s;ent
<PB N="6" REF="5">footing: it is true, the profligacy of the capital made &s;ome inroads upon the country, but the inhabitants of the country looked on it with dread and a&s;toni&s;hment. Some of the nobility and principal gentry, at this time, &s;pent part of their winter in London, but the re&s;t of the year they lived among&s;t their te|nants with their u&s;ual ho&s;pitality. The ex|pences of this age were confined to the edu|cation of their children, to their hou&s;es, their buildings, their furniture, their attendants and their entertainments; and their tenants and neighbours were con&s;iderably the better for it: the more they circulated their property within their own e&s;tates, the richer their e&s;tates became, and the more powerful and re&s;pectable they grew. Effeminacy of man|ners was then &s;een only in cities; balls and a&s;&s;emblies were &s;carcely known, and equipages far from being general.</P>
<P>Matters however re&s;ted not here. Things gazed at with a&s;toni&s;hment quickly grew fa|miliar: the infection of the fir&s;t cla&s;s &s;oon &s;pread among the &s;econd, and what they for|merly cen&s;ured, they pre&s;ently approved. Gen|tlemen of &s;mall e&s;tates began annually to vi&s;it the capital; they gradually made their vi&s;its
<PB N="7" REF="6">longer and longer, till, at la&s;t, it became the fa&s;hion to re&s;ide only in the country, when the heat made it intolerable in town. Stage|coaches were e&s;tabli&s;hed, the communication between London and the country became more and more open, a ta&s;te for elegancies &s;pread it&s;elf through all ranks and degrees of men, and an equipage was con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary of life.</P>
<P>What is the ca&s;e now? Are things other|wi&s;e than they were? No; expences are yet increa&s;ing, and we are &s;till refining upon luxuries. The &s;everal cities and large towns of this i&s;land catch the manners of the metro|polis, and are vicious and extravagant, in proportion to the wealth and number of their inhabitants. Scarce a town now, of any mag|nitude, but has its Theatre Royal, its concerts, its balls, and its card-parties. The notions of &s;plendour and amu&s;ement that prevail in the Capital are eagerly adopted; the various changes of the fa&s;hion exactly copied, and the whole manner of life &s;tudiou&s;ly imitated. Flys and machines pa&s;s from city to city; great towns become the winter re&s;idence of tho&s;e whom &s;lenderne&s;s of fortune will not carry to Lon|don, and the country is every where de&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">If I might pre&s;ume to dictate to the world, I would venture to &s;ay, that a man of landed property is never &s;o re&s;pectable as when refi|dent on his e&s;tate; when improving his lands and enriching his tenants; when his benefi|cence may be read in the looks of the poor; when his hou&s;e is open, not with the &s;tiffne&s;s of a public day, that tells the neighbour|hood he would not be perplexed at another time, but with all the ho&s;pitality of an ancient Baron.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of very exten&s;ive property may act as they plea&s;e; the di&s;&s;ipation and ex|pences of a capital can no other ways injure them than in the opinion of their neighbours; but as to men of &s;mall fortune, the le&s;s they &s;ee of London the better. Look round among the families we know, and we can ea&s;ily trace the infection of the metropolis; the more they pay their vi&s;its there, and the longer they continue, the more vi&s;ible are their follies, and not only their follies, but their failings and their vices. The hone&s;t frankne&s;s of the country gentleman is obliterated by the equi|vocal politene&s;s of the courtier, and the open &s;incerity of the good neighbour lo&s;t in the artifice and deceit of the man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">For many years a <HI>country &s;quire</HI> has been an object of ridicule: but, why? No other rea|&s;on can be given, but that want of poli&s;h that too often characterizes the fops of the age. If we dive&s;t our&s;elves of prejudice, he will not appear in &s;o contemptible a light: it is true, he may want ta&s;te and politene&s;s, but he may po&s;&s;e&s;s qualities infinitely &s;uperior. Hone&s;t unadorned freedom is preferable to &s;tudied and fa&s;hionable deceit. The country <HI>&s;quire</HI> lives upon his e&s;tate, &s;pends his patrimony among his tenants and his neighbours, (which form, as it were, but one family around him) and a &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality opens his doors to every comer; while the fine gentleman vi&s;its his domain, perhaps, but once in the &s;um|mer, &s;tays there as little as he can help, di&s;|dains any familiarity with his neighbours, neglects his grounds, and leaves his tenants at the mercy of his &s;teward, In &s;hort, an effeminate life ema&s;culates the fine gentleman, and renders him unfit for any thing but &s;ip|ping of tea, and dealing the cards; whil&s;t the robu&s;t and manly exerci&s;es of the <HI>&s;quire</HI> keep him healthy and hardy, and, inured to hun|ger, danger and fatigue, enable him, when
<PB N="10" REF="9">called upon in the public cau&s;e, to be of <HI>real</HI> &s;ervice to his country.</P>
<P>But it is to be lamented, that the true coun|try gentleman is &s;eldom to be found. The luxuries and effeminacies of the age have &s;oft|ened down the hardy roughne&s;s of former times; and the country, like the capital, is one &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation. If there be any economy in their expences, it is merely the &s;aving of nece&s;&s;aries, to wa&s;te on &s;uperfluities: the pri|vate gentleman with three or four hundred pounds a year mu&s;t have his hor&s;es, his dogs, his pictures, his carriages, his parties of plea|&s;ure, equally with him of five times his for|tune: dre&s;s, &s;how and entertainment engro&s;s his attention; his lands are unimproved; debts accumulate upon him; he mortgages his e&s;tate; and, when he has lived to the end of his fortune, he either puts a dreadful period to his exi&s;tence, or wears out the remainder of his life, a beggar.</P>
<P>However alarming this picture may be, it is neverthele&s;s a ju&s;t one. As I take it, the happine&s;s of life con&s;i&s;ts in health, ea&s;e, and competency, which is as much within the reach of a gentleman of three hundred pounds a-year, as one of three thou&s;and. If the ar|ticles
<PB N="11" REF="10">of living are dearer than they were &s;ome few years back, (and they certainly are, a hundred <HI>per cent.</HI>) it ought to quicken the in|du&s;try of every one, to increa&s;e his income, if po&s;&s;ible, or reduce his expence in proportion to his fortune.</P>
<P>It is not in the power of men, who have the income only of a &s;mall e&s;tate to &s;upport them, to encrea&s;e their revenues; but they may decrea&s;e their expences, or lay out their money to advantage. Frugality and economy have put many upon a footing with men of larger fortunes; and often made them far more re&s;pectable.&mdash;Nothing gives &s;upe|riority in life, but independency. Whil&s;t we are at the command of another, we are in a &s;tate of &s;ubordination: it is being ma&s;ter of one's &s;elf only, that makes a man free; and it is independency that makes him great.</P>
<P>Now, be our fortune as great as it will, we are never independent, whil&s;t we are in debt; and can a man be &s;aid to be free, while it is in the power of his taylor or his &s;hoemaker to confine him? A mi&s;taken notion, that a re|duction in our way of living is di&s;graceful, has led many a man to his ruin. Retrench|ing our expences, when we have lived too fa&s;t,
<PB N="12" REF="11">is a proof of good &s;en&s;e; it declares an ab|horrence of our follies, and a determination to be in future <HI>free.</HI> It is highly degrading to make a figure at the expence of others. Vil|lains of every denomination have done it; an hone&s;t man therefore will de&s;pi&s;e the thought; and, if his connections have in&s;en&s;ibly led him on, from one expence to another, till he finds him&s;elf involved, he will pur&s;ue the earlie&s;t and the readie&s;t means to di&s;charge his debts and &s;et him&s;elf at liberty.</P>
<P>Such is the ab&s;urdity in life, that men are rated in worth, according to the appearance they make. "Keep up appearances,"&mdash;&s;aid a di&s;&s;ipated poet,
<Q><L>Keep up appearances: there lies the te&s;t!</L>
<L>The world will give thee credit for the re&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>This idle notion has brought on the de|&s;truction of thou&s;ands. In this luxurious age, wealth is the only object of admiration; and to wear the appearance of wealth, we become expen&s;ive and extravagant in our manner of living. Thus we go on, 'till we exhau&s;t the little property we po&s;&s;e&s;s; and, when we can keep our&s;elves no longer afloat, on what is called Credit, we &s;ink into beg|gary and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">He who lives within his income, may be truly called a <HI>rich</HI> man. It is this that gives the Hollanders the reputation of being wealthy. They never live to the extent of their fortunes; and, of cour&s;e, are able to do a deal of good. A family e&s;tate with them is &s;eldom put up to &s;ale; whereas with us, inheritances are ever at market. A Dutch|man contributes as largely and as chearfully to the exigencies of the &s;tate, or to the erec|tion of a public building, as he would to the repairs of his hou&s;e, or the decoration of his garden.</P>
<P>To be re&s;pectable, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to live in a certain line of life.&mdash;Every man may be con&s;idered as the centre of a circle; &s;ome of a larger, &s;ome of a &s;maller; and, in this light, he is of greater or of le&s;s importance, according to the character he bears.&mdash;He who has fewe&s;t wants, and is mo&s;t able to live within him&s;elf, is not only the happie&s;t, but the riche&s;t man; and if he does not abound in what the world calls Wealth, he does in in|dependency.&mdash;Though he may not be a Peer of his own country, he is a Lord of the creation; may fill his &s;tation equal to the fir&s;t of men; and look down with pity and con|tempt
<PB N="14" REF="13">on the tin&s;elled &s;ycophant, though covered with an ermined robe, and parading with a ducal coronet.</P>
<P>I will allow, it is rather mortifying to &s;ee a neighbour of le&s;s preten&s;ions than our&s;elves, living in a degree of &s;plendour which we can|not reach. If his fortune be large enough, to admit of it, it is well; if not, he is an object of contempt. But, be it as it may, whil&s;t we have &s;ufficient to command the nece&s;&s;aries and indulgencies of life, (wanting the &s;uperfluities) and do ab&s;olutely enjoy them, we are in a &s;ituation equal to any man; and if we keep but a pair of hor&s;es, and pay for that pair, we are far more re&s;pectable, in the eyes of &s;en&s;ible people, than he who is drawn in a coach and &s;ix, but his gate everla&s;t|ingly crowded with importunate creditors.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons with circum&s;cribed fortunes, or who&s;e family encrea&s;es upon them, would do well to retrench their expences in time; or retire from towns, and lay out their money with economy. It is wonderful to think what an appearance in life a per&s;on may make for a little money, who re&s;ides wholly in the country, and makes the mo&s;t of what he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es.
<PB N="15" REF="14">I &s;peak not to per&s;ons in trade, as the &s;cheme may be impracticable with them, but to gentlemen of &s;mall fortune, who, in a rural retreat, with a few acres of land, may live as well on three or four hundred pounds a-year, as many do, on three times the &s;um. The oc|cupier of a middling farm enjoys all the nece&s;|&s;aries and conveniencies of life, and many of its &s;uperfluities. Where &s;hall we meet with better health, than where temperance and ex|erci&s;e enliven our minds, invigorate our bodies, and give a con&s;tant flow of &s;pirits? A country life is commonly a chearful one; we there meet few of tho&s;e rubs that embitter the hours of other men, and are the too con&s;tant at|tendants on ambition and vanity. It is there only that true happine&s;s and independen|cy can be found; where hone&s;ty and the be&s;t of manners mark the man; and where employment exempts from the ill effects of luxury</P>
<P>The following then is an e&s;timate whereby, a gentleman, with a wife, four children, and five &s;ervants, living in the country, may, with frugality, &s;ave 2500l. in the cour&s;e of twenty years, keep two of his children at a boarding|&s;chool,
<PB N="16" REF="15">drink wine every day at his table, keep a carriage and four hor&s;es, and make an appearance equal to 1000l. a year, for half the money; and may, with the further addi|tion of a &s;mall farm, live equally well for con&s;iderably le&s;s.</P>

<P>All lands will not yield the &s;ame cour&s;e of crops, but the produce in &s;even years will be nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I have &s;uppo&s;ed the ground to be tolerably good, and a particular attention to be paid in keeping it clean, well dre&s;&s;ed, and in good tilth: for this purpo&s;e no &s;traw is to be &s;old off the farm but wheat &s;traw. It is all to be converted into fodder and dung.</P>
<P>If the farming &s;ervant can be &s;pared at times, he may thre&s;h much of the grain him|&s;elf; this will be a &s;aving: and there are &s;till many advantages to be reaped, if a man will enter into the &s;pirit of farming, from a neigh|bouring common, in breeding &s;heep, bringing up heifers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and keeping gee&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, a tolerable good farm will, upon an average, produce, with good management, 30<HI>s.</HI> or 40<HI>s. per</HI> acre, free of all expences.</P>
<P>The price that corn bears, will often make an alteration in the profits of a farm, but I have &s;et it a medium price.</P>
