<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM Dryden's period to our pre&s;ent days,</L>
<L>Thus would be-critics cen&s;ure modern plays;</L>
<L>Some are too dull, without intrigue, or je&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>And &s;ome mere &s;peaking pantomimes at be&s;t;</L>
<L>That living authors are by dead &s;urpa&s;t,</L>
<L>So he mu&s;t write the wor&s;t, who writes the la&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>Still each new drama captiou&s;ly they blame,</L>
<L>And, though the town be pleas'd, deny it &s;ame.</L>
<L>Should this deci&s;ion be allow'd as ju&s;t,</L>
<L>The bays denied the Bard, may grace his bu&s;t!</L>
<L>But if this ta&s;te for antiques we pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Age may improve wit, wine, and women too.</L>
<L>One <HI>old opinion</HI> we would &s;till retain,</L>
<L>The right that England has to rule the main!</L>
<L>Long as the &s;ea &s;hall fence our envied land,</L>
<L>Long as our navy &s;hall the &s;ea command;</L>
<L>So long &s;hall Howe's, St. Vincent's, Duncan's name,</L>
<L>Be grav'd by memory on the rock of &s;ame!</L>
<L>The page of hi&s;t'ry &s;hall their deeds repeat,</L>
<L>With Britain's triumph, and the foe's defeat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! the pen&s;ive mu&s;e, with tearful eye,</L>
<L>Views glory's brighte&s;t triumph with a &s;igh!</L>
<L>And mid&s;t the &s;houts victorious fleets attend</L>
<L>Mourns o'er the a&s;hes of an honoured friend,</L>
<L>Who in his country's quarrel fought and bled,</L>
<L>By England numbered with her patriot dead!</L>
<L>May war's alarms mid&s;t rival nations cea&s;e,</L>
<L>And all embrace that lovely &s;tranger&mdash;Peace,</L>
<L>Who&s;e olive branch once planted by her hand,</L>
<L>Shall ble&s;s a loyal, brave, and happy land.</L>
</LG>

<L>This night our Author's hopes on you are placed,</L>
<L>His former efforts by your &s;miles were graced;</L>
<L>To your decree &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively he bends,</L>
<L>Tru&s;ting his judges will be found his friends.</L>

<P>SILENCE, I &s;ay! Why, you keep as loud a gabbling as if you were &s;ettling the balance of Europe in the lobby of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Order, I &s;ay&mdash;the que&s;tion is this.

<P>Why, I thinks, that for the death of an old ma&s;ter, a little dripping from the eyes would be quite natural.</P>

<P>It may be natural, ma&s;ter Cook; but lord ble&s;s you, the genteel feel of your tip top folks, is no more like nature, than one of your fine kabobbed frica&s;&s;ees is to plain roa&s;t and <HI>taties.</HI> Be&s;ides, when a man leaves behind him a good ten thou&s;and a year, I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh.

<Q>We can recommend this &s;tory as uniting to a great degree of intere&s;t the rarer qualities of good &s;en&s;e, and an accurate knowledge of mankind. The grammatical errors and vulgari&s;ms which di&s;grace many even of our mo&s;t celebrated novels, have here no place; and &s;everal of the &s;horter poe|tical pieces inter&s;per&s;ed through the work, have very con&s;iderable merit. Amu&s;ement is combined with utility, and fiction is inli&s;ted in the cau&s;e of virtue and practical philo&s;ophy.

<P>The writers of the Monthly Revicw for la&s;t month &s;ay, "We cannot di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e volumes without ob&s;erving, that they contain a con&s;iderable portion of political information. The work will, by its di&s;cerning readers, be characterized as highly intere&s;ting; and it will prove particularly &s;o to tho&s;e who &s;till remember the times to which the anecdotes here recorded are referable. To the future hi&s;torian al&s;o it will afford much a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by con|tributing, in many in&s;tances, towards the means of information, which, but for publications of this kind, might be utterly con&s;igned to oblivion.</P>
<P>The writers of the Analytical Review for January la&s;t, &s;ay, "The work before us will be found particularly intere&s;ting to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to obtain an idea of the management of &s;tate affairs in this country, during the whole of the pre&s;ent reign."</P>
<P>The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January la&s;t, &s;ay, "The&s;e volumes are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham, and are not inferior to that work either in intere&s;t or intelligence. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times, particularly from the year 1760 to the year 1780, (an important pe|riod), which, the writer a&s;&s;ures us, have not been printed, will receive fiom this work much plea&s;ure and information."</P>
<P>The writers of the European Magazine, &s;ay, "The editor of the&s;e volumes is entitled to the thanks of the public, for pre&s;erving many facts which otherwi&s;e might have fallen into oblivion. The reader will find entertain|ment and information in them, and the future inve&s;tigator of the acts of the pre&s;ent reign will meet with &s;ome valuable materials to exerci&s;e his &s;agacity upon, which are to be no where el&s;e found, and which will &s;erve to guide him through the ob&s;cure paths of political fine&s;&s;e."</P>
<P N="8">8. The ANECDOTES of LORD CHATHAM's LIFE. The Sixth Edition. In Three Volumes, 8vo. Price 18s. Boards.</P>
<Q>The author has made a valuable Collection of Anecdotes, e&s;pecially of the late and mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He &s;ays he is not con&s;cious of having advanced one fal&s;ehood: We give credit to his declaration, having found no cau&s;e to doubt it.

<Q><PB REF="77"><P>A greater number of curious and intere&s;ting anecdotes, concerning public affairs, have not appeared &s;ince the days of Sir William Temple, than are to be found in this work.</P>
<P>We cannot di&s;mi&s;s this article without acknowledging, that it throws a great and new light upon the occurences and events of more than half a century of our hi&s;tory.</P>

A RESIDENCE in FRANCE, during the Years 1792, 3, 4, &amp; 5; de&s;cribed in a Series of Letters from an ENGLISH LADY, with general and incidental Re|marks on the French Character and Manners.

<Q>It is only ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that the &s;tyle is as poli&s;hed as the matter is intere&s;ting and important: nor have we any doubt that the book will remain a permanent monument of the ta&s;te and talents of the writer.

<Q>We have found &s;o many lively and plea&s;ant exhibitions of manners, &s;o many amu&s;ing and intere&s;ting anecdotes, and &s;o many ob&s;ervations and reflections, gay and grave, &s;portive and &s;entimental, (all expre&s;&s;ed in a gay and familiar &s;tyle,) better &s;uited to the purpo&s;e than &s;entences laboured with artificial exactne&s;s, that we cannot but recommend it to our readers as a highly amu&s;ing and intere&s;ting performance.

<Q><P>The grounds of M. De Rulhiere's information &s;eem indi&s;putable, and his readers appear to have every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with his di&s;cernment, in unfolding the motives and circum&s;tances that concurred in bringing about this &s;triking event. He is no &s;ervile copier, but has drawn his characters, and de&s;cribed his &s;cenes, with the hand of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only add, that we have &s;eldom met with more intere&s;ting original anecdotes, than tho&s;e that are contained in the little work which we have now reviewed.</P>
