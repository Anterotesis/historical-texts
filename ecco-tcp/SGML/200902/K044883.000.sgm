<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Thirteenth Satire of Juvenal has been al|ways admired by the able&s;t judges, not merely for its elegance and poetical &s;pirit, but as a &s;ublime com|po&s;ition, containing the pure&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful moral doctrine, &s;uch as goes home to the brea&s;t and bu&s;i|ne&s;s of every man in &s;ociety. The Author launches out, with his u&s;ual indignation, again&s;t the reigning vices of the times, and particularly FRAUD and PER|JURY. He introduces his &s;ubject with an apparent intention to con&s;ole a friend, who had depo&s;ited a &s;um of money in the hands of a man ba&s;e enough to deny the tru&s;t, and &s;upport his fraud by a daring Perjury.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5">
He ob&s;erves, in the out&s;et, that the guilty are ne|ver at peace; they have no re&s;t from their own relentle&s;s thoughts; and yet deceit, and treachery, and inju&s;tice prevail in the ma&s;s of human life. He paints forth the vices of mankind in glaring colours; and, having by way of contra&s;t mentioned the times of innocence (commonly called the Golden Age), he takes occa&s;ion to place in a ridiculous light the whole &s;y&s;tem of the Heathen Mythology. The wit and plea&s;antry, with which this part of the poem is exe|cuted, are truly beautiful: but there is rea&s;on to fear that the whole pa&s;&s;age would now be thought an un&s;ea&s;onable digre&s;&s;ion; and, for that rea&s;on, it was judged advi&s;able, in the Engli&s;h Poem, to &s;ub|&s;titute ideas drawn from modern manners.</P>
<P>Juvenal proceeds to ob&s;erve the intrepidity with which perjury is often committed. The fear of de|tection
<PB N="ix" REF="6">by human evidence, he &s;ays, is the only re|&s;traint: &s;ecure from that danger, the offender is ready, as Shake&s;peare has it, <HI>to jump the life to come.</HI> Of this depravity two cau&s;es are a&s;&s;igned: in the fir&s;t place, Athei&s;m; and &s;econdly, even among believers, the delu&s;ive hope of e&s;caping puni&s;hment, or of ex|piating the &s;in by repentance at a future day. The Poet, after this, exhibits a black li&s;t of crimes; and, in &s;uch a general corruption of manners, exhorts his friend to appea&s;e re&s;entment in his own particular ca&s;e. Revenge, he &s;ays, is a little pa&s;&s;ion. He recurs to his fir&s;t propo&s;ition, namely, that the Perjurer, even though he may elude the hand of ju&s;tice, is &s;ure to &s;uffer the &s;elf-condemning award of his own con&s;cience. He de&s;cribes in bold relief the horrors of a guilty mind. He traces the progre&s;s of vice, beginning with a petty fraud, and ru&s;hing on, with apparent &s;ucce&s;s, till at length &s;ome foul enormity
<PB N="x" REF="7">calls down the &s;entence of the law, and gives full proof to the world that a &s;uperintending Providence watches over the deeds of men, and finally overtakes the offender with &s;low, but certain vengeance.</P>
<P>Such is the moral that in&s;pires and animates the whole of Juvenal's admirable performance. It may be called A POETICAL STATUTE OF FRAUDS AND PERJURIES. A compo&s;ition &s;o truly valuable ought not to remain in the hands of the &s;cholar only, like a &s;word in the &s;cabbard, as Tully has it, <HI>tamquam in vagin&acirc; reconditum.</HI> The doctrine &s;hould be im|pre&s;&s;ed on every mind. For this purpo&s;e, the mode of imitation was thought more eligible than a direct and clo&s;e tran&s;lation. Mr. Pope had led the way, and the late Doctor John&s;on followed him with di&s;|tingui&s;hed applau&s;e. The fine u&s;e which he made of the Third and Tenth Satires of Juvenal, in LONDON,
<PB N="xi" REF="8">a Poem, and THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES, is well known to every reader of ta&s;te. In fact, tho&s;e two pieces are fini&s;hed with &s;uch vigour of &s;entiment, and &s;uch &s;trength and harmony of language, as may well preclude in the pre&s;ent writer all hope of com|petition. It is to be regretted that &s;o fine a Moral Poet did not employ a portion of his time upon the Satire now before us. The author of the following lines endeavoured, at various times, to excite him to the undertaking; but the an&s;wer always was, "I WISH IT WAS DONE." The reader will, no doubt, wi&s;h the &s;ame, and by the pen of DOCTOR JOHN|SON. To &s;upply the deficiency is the de&s;ign of the piece now offered to the public. It is, at lea&s;t, a well intended attempt, and requires no apology.</P>
