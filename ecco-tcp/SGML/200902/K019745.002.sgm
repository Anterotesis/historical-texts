<P>_I Take up my pen once more to give you the remainder of my &s;ad &s;tory; and am plea&s;ed to find that many of your female readers expre&s;s a ju&s;t abhor|rence of the character of Belinda. I feel my heart too much affected with the remembrance of the &s;orrows &s;he occa&s;ioned me, to enter into a detail of all her little artifices to en&s;nare the heart of my hu&s;band: there was an endle&s;s variety in her tem|per, which kept his attention perpetually awake, and prevended all &s;atiety; and &s;he had &s;o perfect a command of her features, that whatever di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="404" REF="3">
&s;he plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume, her countenance expre&s;&s;ed it as naturally as if &s;he really felt it.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band grew every day more fond of the company of one who always pre&s;ented a new face to him, &s;ometimes airy and &s;parkling, &s;ometimes tender and melancholy, now haughty and impe|rious, then &s;oftened into a gentle langui&s;hment. While I was ignorant of her in&s;idious de&s;ign, I di|verted my&s;elf with her fanta&s;tic behaviour; but Alcander now di&s;covered &s;uch an extreme attach|ment to her, that I began to grow unea&s;y. I was afraid of examining into the nature of my own doubts and fears; the &s;u&s;picion that my Alcander was grown indifferent to me, and loved another, was &s;omething &s;o new, &s;o &s;trange, &s;o &s;hocking to my heart, that I rejected it with horror; yet &s;pite of my&s;elf I &s;ought the melancholy conviction, and found it in his looks, his words, and every circum|&s;tance of his behaviour.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t thought was to expo&s;tulate with him upon his change; but my pride oppo&s;ed this, and rea&s;on told me that upbraidings would not recal his affections: I re&s;olved, therefore to &s;eem ig|norant of my misfortune, and flattering my&s;elf that when my dangerous gue&s;t had left me, the im|pre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made would be removed, I pa|tiently waited for her departure.</P>
<P>When &s;he told me of her intention to return to London in a day or two, my heart bounded with joy, and I &s;corned to di&s;&s;emble &s;o far as to de&s;ire her to &s;tay any longer; but what became of me! when turning my eyes upon Alcander, I &s;aw him pale as death, and unable to utter a word, &s;o great|ly
<PB N="405" REF="4">
was he affected with the thoughts of parting. At length recovering him&s;elf, he &s;olicited her to &s;tay &s;ome time longer, with &s;uch be&s;eeching looks, and &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s of intreaty, that finding my&s;elf unable to &s;upport this &s;cene, I ro&s;e up, and com|plaining of a &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition, retired to my chamber.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band followed me immediately; and I, eager to admit every thought that could give me comfort, con&s;idered this as an effect of his tender|ne&s;s and concern for me; but I was &s;oon unde|ceived: he came only to reprove me for my in|civility to my gue&s;t, in not pre&s;&s;ing her to &s;tay longer; and he had the cruelty to de&s;ire I would u&s;e my undeavours to keep her with us.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered nothing, but bur&s;t into tears. Al|cander, who doubtle&s;s knew the cau&s;e, and dreaded an explanation, left the room without taking any notice of my di&s;order. Oh, how unlike was this to his former behaviour! I thought I &s;hould have died with grief; but pride and re&s;entment came to my aid: I re&s;olved not to add to Belinda's tri|umph, by &s;uffering my unea&s;ine&s;s to appear. I therefore compo&s;ed my looks; and when &s;he came with an affected &s;olicitude to enquire after my health, &s;he found me in appearance ea&s;y and tranquil.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band finding me fully determined not to hinder Belinda from leaving us, declared his in|tention to go to London, and coldly a&s;ked me if it would be agreeable to me? I replied, that I would certainly accompany him; &s;o we all &s;et out together. Belinda and I parted with great indif|ference
<PB N="406" REF="5">
on both &s;ides. I dropt all intercour&s;e with her; and this put my hu&s;band into &s;o bad a humour, that he treated me with the mo&s;t morti|fying neglect.</P>
<P>My father was dead: my mother, who loved me tenderly, and was attentive to the behaviour of my hu&s;band, &s;oon perceived the e&s;trangement of his affections. In her bo&s;om I poured out all my &s;or|rows, and regulated my conduct by her prudence: &s;he recommended to me patience and &s;ilence; and above all, conjured me to keep the fatal &s;ecret from my brother; his temper was ra&s;h and impe|tuous; he was extremely fond of me, and every thing was to be dreaded from his re&s;entment, if my hu&s;band's injurious treatment ever came to his knowledge. This however it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent; my unhappy &s;ituation became generally known, &s;o open was Alcander in his neglect of me, and his gallantries to Belinda.</P>
<P>My brother expo&s;tulated with him upon his be|haviour: the event was what my mother and I had often apprehended; they fought, Alcander was wounded; he was brought home in a chair, in a very weak condition. I &s;wooned at the &s;ight of him, and when I recovered I found my&s;elf in my mother's arms: &s;he informed me my brother was not hurt, and that Alcander's &s;urgeons had a&s;&s;ured her he was not in the lea&s;t danger. The horrors I had laboured under were relieved by this news, but my peace was lo&s;t for ever. I at|tended my hu&s;band con&s;tantly during his illne&s;s, which was but of &s;hort continuance; he received my cares with a coldne&s;s that pierced me to the
<PB N="407" REF="6">
heart; and when he was &s;o far recovered as to be able to go into the country, he gave me to un|der&s;tand that he would di&s;pen&s;e with my com|pany there.</P>
<P>I was beginning to expo&s;tulate with him; but he &s;topped my mouth, by telling me with a de|termined air, that he never could pardon me for having expo&s;ed him to the in&s;ult he had received from my brother; that I had made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to alter his conduct, &s;ince the world would con&s;true it into a ba&s;e fear of my brother: he con|cluded, with advi&s;ing me to go and re&s;ide with my mother, and without waiting for my an&s;wer, left me.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the various pa&s;|&s;ions which tortured me by turns; but fond as I &s;till was of my faithle&s;s hu&s;band, the indignation I felt for his unworthy u&s;age of me, helped to &s;up|port my &s;pirits, and hindered me from yielding to the violence of my grief. I put my&s;elf under my mother's protection, and re&s;igned my&s;elf quietly to my fate.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band a few months afterwards went to Italy, di&s;gu&s;ted, as I have heard, with the be|haviour of Belinda; who, to recover her reputa|tion, which this affair had greatly &s;ullied, &s;acrificed him to her mirth upon all occa&s;ions, and made her contempt of him as public as his attachment to her had been. Her triumph however was &s;hort: &s;he experienced the greate&s;t misfortune that could happen to a woman who thought beauty the &s;u|preme&s;t good: &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox,
<PB N="408" REF="7">
which made &s;uch ravage in her face that &s;he was hardly to be known: her pa&s;&s;ion for admiration &s;till remains, though the power of exciting it is gone. Hence ari&s;es her puni&s;hment; and &s;he who delighted in giving pain to others, finds in her&s;elf a perpetual &s;ource of vexation. I am,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE AUTHOR of the TRIFLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you confe&s;s that you are not &s;uperior to trifles, will you accept of a trifling criti|ci&s;m, which if honoured with a place in your Mu|&s;eum, may, for the future, perhaps occa&s;ion a dif|ferent manner of reading and acting one particular pa&s;&s;age in Macbeth, that hitherto has been gene|rally, if not always, mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;ap|plied.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth &s;cene of the fourth act, a me&s;&s;en|ger of &s;ome rank, Ro&s;&s;e, comes to let Macduff know that his ca&s;tle has been &s;urpri&s;ed, and his wife and children &s;avagely &s;laughtered. The young king of Scotland, Malcolm, who had been &s;ome time at the Engli&s;h court, &s;olliciting troops and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, undertakes to comfort his friend and &s;ubject Macduff, who had attended him to England, and was deeply in|volved in his cau&s;e. Macduff, for &s;ome moments, remains thunder-&s;truck and &s;ilent. Malcolm, by way of con&s;olation, &s;ays,</P>
<P><HI>What, man, ne'er pull your hat upon your brows. Give &s;orrow words; the grief that does not &s;peak, whi&s;pers the o'er fraught heart, and bids it break.</HI></P>
<P>Macduff pays no regard or attention to Mal|colm, but turning to Ro&s;&s;e, &s;ays, <HI>My children too!</HI>
<PB N="410" REF="9">
Ro&s;&s;e replies, <HI>Wife, children, &s;ervants, all that could be found.</HI> Macduff. <HI>And I mu&s;t be from thence: my wife killed too?</HI> Ro&s;&s;e. <HI>I've &s;aid.</HI> Macduff makes no immediate an&s;wer; but enfolding his arms, and hanging down his head, in all the me|lancholy &s;ilence of inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, &s;tands fixed like a &s;tatue on the farther &s;ide of the &s;tage. Mal|colm, endeavouring to awaken Macduff from this lethargy of woe, approaches near to him, and &s;ays, <HI>Be comforted, let's make us medicines of our griefs re|venge, to cure this deadly grief.</HI> Macduff &s;till re|mains motionle&s;s and unmoved; but when he looks up, and &s;ees his royal friend Malcolm re|turned to Ro&s;&s;e, on the other &s;ide of the &s;tage, he &s;ighs deeply, and in a low voice expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf thus: <HI>He has no children. What all my pretty ones? did you &s;ay all? what all?</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>He has no children,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed and under&s;tood to refer to Macbeth, who having no children, could not afford to Macduff an adequate revenge. The &s;uppo&s;ition undoubtedly is natural. In ca&s;es of in|jury, the law of retaliation never fails to occur to our minds, and to be the object of our pa&s;&s;ions: but the fact is not true. Macbeth had a &s;on, his name was Luthlac. After the death of his father he was extremely trouble&s;ome to Malcolm: he claimed the crown; and though a very weak deficient young man, he an&s;wered the intentions of a rebel|lious party, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch followers as had been attached to the late Macbeth. They carried him to Scone, and he was there &s;aluted king. The com|petition was &s;hort, nor had it any very dangerous or extraordinary circum&s;tances. In le&s;s than three
<PB N="411" REF="10">
months the u&s;urper Luthlac was &s;lain by Mal|colm: then, and not till then, ended the race of Macbeth.</P>
<P>From hence it evidently appears that the &s;en|tence, <HI>He has no children,</HI> cannot refer to Macbeth. At whom then is it pointed? At Malcolm. The heart-&s;truck Macduff heard with patience the con|&s;olatory advice, admini&s;tred by his royal ma&s;ter; but well knew, and could not avoid expre&s;&s;ing to him&s;elf, that as Malcolm had no children he could little judge of that torrent of grief with which Macduff mu&s;t naturally be overwhelmed, at the lo&s;s of a wife, and <HI>all his pretty ones.</HI></P>
<P>Malcolm was not married; he could not feel the throbs of a parent's heart, or the angui&s;h of an hu&s;band's love. To him the &s;weet and inexpre&s;|&s;ible &s;en&s;ations of nuptial happine&s;s were unknown: he was ignorant of the decent pride, the ri&s;ing hopes, the alluring pro&s;pects, that occupy, and &s;well alternately a father's brea&s;t. Young and unexpe|rienced, he had not felt tho&s;e thilling nerves of na|ture, which are never &s;trung but by virtuous love and parental palpitations. The good natured Mal|colm offered his advice un&s;ea&s;onably: he broke prematurely in upon &s;orrow that mu&s;t require time and rea&s;on to &s;ink it&s;elf into the gulph of &s;atiety. The intention of Malcolm was kind to the highe&s;t de|gree. The effect of that intention was exerted in too ha&s;ty and too improper a manner, <HI>for Malcolm had no children.</HI></P>
<P>This con&s;truction &s;eems &s;upported by a &s;entence which &s;oon follows, where Malcolm again comes to the friendly charge of con&s;olation, and &s;ays,
<PB N="412" REF="11">
<HI>Support it like a man. I &s;hall,</HI> &s;ays Macduff; <HI>but I mu&s;t al&s;o feel it as a man;</HI> that is,
<Q>I mu&s;t feel it as an hu&s;band and as a parent:</Q>
or to expatiate upon the thought, Macduff in tho&s;e few words means thus to expre&s;s him&s;elf:
<Q>I mu&s;t in the relation of father and hu&s;band, &s;uffer the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;ations of grief that human nature can imbibe. Not all the world can repair my lo&s;s. By the cruel mur|der of my wife, I am deprived, for ever depriv|ed, of the be&s;t of all my friends. Many are dear to me: &s;he was the deare&s;t. In my children, I have lo&s;t the pride of my hou&s;e, the comforts of my age, the engaging amu&s;ements of my do|me&s;tic hours, the future &s;ervants, &s;ubjects, and defenders of my king and country. You mu&s;t be a father and a hu&s;band, Malcolm, 'ere you can mea&s;ure my grief; for I cannot but remember <HI>&s;uch things were, that were mo&s;t precious to me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>According to this interpretation, the actor mu&s;t &s;hew by &s;ome ge&s;ture, &s;ome motion either of his head or hand, that Malcolm is the per&s;on in his thoughts, when he &s;ays, <HI>He has no children.</HI> After &s;taying &s;ome time in the place where he was fir&s;t &s;truck motionle&s;s, he is rouzed at once by indigna|tion and cro&s;&s;ing the &s;tage, &s;ays to Ro&s;&s;e, <HI>What, all my pretty ones?</HI></P>
<P>In this view, I think, Shake&s;pear di&s;plays his own character, and reveals his own &s;entiments as a pa|rent. If the &s;entence had referred &s;olely to Mac|beth (&s;uppo&s;ing he had no children) it carries with it rage, fury, and revenge? If to Malcolm, it is the reflection of a wi&s;e con&s;iderate man, who is thank|ful
<PB N="413" REF="12">
to his friend for his advice, but con&s;cious that that advice is, for the pre&s;ent, to no purpo&s;e,</P>
<P>Buchanan in his Hi&s;tory of Scotland evidently proves, that Macbeth had a &s;on at the time when Macduff's wife and children were &s;lain. Shake&s;pear, the mo&s;t exact of all dramatic hi&s;torians, could never intend that he &s;hould appear he had none. The following quotation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, Book VII. the reign of Malcolm III. the eighty-&s;ixth king of Scotland.</NOTE> will &s;upport me in my a&s;|&s;ertion.</P>
<P><Q>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were tran&s;acted at Forfar, they who remained of the faction of Macbeth, carried his &s;on Luthlac to Scone (who was &s;ir|named Fatuus from his want of wit) and there he was &s;aluted king. Malcolm a&s;&s;aulted him in the valley Bogian, where he was &s;lain three months after he had u&s;urped the name of king; out of re&s;pect to the kingly race, his, and his father's bodies were buried in the royal &s;e|pulchres in Ionia.</Q> I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long before Sophia had an account of Sir Charles's vi&s;it from her mother, who, forgetting the part &s;he had acted before, wrote her a letter full of invectives again&s;t her ob&s;tinacy and di&s;obedience, and bitter upbraidings of her folly, for lo&s;ing by her ill-timed pride, the heart of &s;uch a man as Sir Charles.</P>
<P>She told her, with a kind of exultation, that he had utterly forgot her, and repeated every circum|&s;tance of his behaviour while he was with her, and every word he had &s;poke, as all tending to &s;hew his indifference; but though this was done to mor|tify Sophia, and make her repent of her precipitate departure, yet her di&s;cernment, and that facility which lovers have, in flattering their own wi&s;hes, pointed out to her many things in this minute relation, which &s;erved rather to nouri&s;h hope than de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley added, as the fini&s;hing &s;troke, that Sir Charles looked pale and thin; &s;he attributed this alteration in his health to the efforts he had made
<PB N="415" REF="14">
to bani&s;h her from his heart, and thence inferred that a re&s;olution which had co&s;t him &s;o much trouble to confirm, would not be ea&s;ily broke through; and that &s;he had no rea&s;on to expect he would ever de&s;ire to &s;ee her more.</P>
<P>Sophia could not read this part of the letter without tears, tears that flowed from tender &s;en&s;i|bility, accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation which was neither grief nor joy, but compo&s;ed of both: that Sir Charles &s;hould re&s;olve to forget her was indeed afflicting, but that this re&s;olution &s;hould co&s;t him &s;truggles &s;o painful as to affect his health, could not but rai&s;e her depre&s;&s;ed hopes, &s;ince it &s;hewed the difficulty of the attempt, and con&s;equently that the &s;ucce&s;s was doubtful.</P>
<P>This letter gave &s;o much employment to her thoughts, that to be at liberty to indulge them &s;he took her evening walk without &s;oliciting the company of her beloved Dolly, and wandered far into the wood, attracted by tho&s;e romantic &s;hades which afford &s;uch &s;oothing plea&s;ure to a love-&s;ick mind. Here, while &s;he meditated on her mother's letter, and read it over and over, &s;till &s;eeking, and &s;till finding &s;omething new in it to engage her at|tention, &s;he heard the voices of &s;ome per&s;ons talk|ing behind her, and &s;uddenly recollecting Dolly's adventure, &s;he began to be alarmed at the di&s;tance to which &s;he had unwarily &s;trayed, and turned her &s;teps ha&s;tily towards home.</P>
<P>Mean time a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind blew off her hat, and carried it &s;everal paces back: &s;he turned, in order to recover it, and &s;aw it taken up by a genteel young man, who on a nearer approach &s;he
<PB N="416" REF="15">
knew to be the lover of her young friend. Plea&s;ed at this encounter, &s;he advanced to receive her hat from him, which he gave her with a blu&s;hing grace, awed by the dignity of her mein, and that &s;park|ling intelligence which beamed in her eyes, and &s;eemed to penetrate into his inmo&s;t &s;oul; for Sophia, who was deeply intere&s;ted for her innocent and unhappy friend, con&s;idered him attentively, and was de&s;irous of entering into &s;ome conver|&s;ation with him, that &s;he might be enabled to form a more exact judgment of his under&s;tanding and manners than &s;he could from the accounts of the partial Dolly.</P>
<P>While &s;he was talking to him they were joined by an ancient gentlewoman, who acco&s;ting Sophia, told her in an affected &s;tyle and formal accent, that her nephew was very happy in having had an op|portunity to do her this little piece of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Sophia, who &s;aw an old woman, apparently op|pre&s;t with the infirmities of years, dre&s;t in all the ridiculous foppery of the la&s;t age, was &s;o little plea&s;ed with her, that &s;he would have an&s;wered this compliment with great coldne&s;s, had not the de&s;ire and hope of being &s;erviceable to her friend made her conquer her growing di&s;gu&s;t; &s;he therefore re|&s;olved to improve this opportunity of commencing an acquaintance with the aunt of young William, and met her advances with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s and affability, &s;o that the old woman was quite charmed with her; and being very de&s;irous to gain her good opinion, and to &s;hew her breeding, of which &s;he was extremely vain, overwhelmed her with trouble&s;ome ceremony; and, to di&s;play her under|&s;tanding,
<PB N="417" REF="16">
of which &s;he was equally proud, murdered &s;o many hard words, that her di&s;cour&s;e was &s;carcely intelligible.</P>
<P>Sophia would fain have drawn in the youth to partake of their conver&s;ation, but his aunt's volu|bility left him very little to &s;ay; yet in that little Sophia thought &s;he di&s;covered both good &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>The evening being now pretty far advanced, Sophia thought it time to &s;eparate, and took leave of her new acquaintance. Their parting was pro|tracted by &s;o many courte&s;ies and compliments from the old lady, that her patience was almo&s;t wearied out; at la&s;t &s;he get free from her, and quickened her pace towards home, when on a &s;ud|den &s;he heard her in a tremulous voice calling out, "Madam, madam, pray &s;top one moment." Sophia looked back, and &s;eeing Mrs. Gibbons come tottering up to her with mere &s;peed than was con&s;i&s;tent with her weakne&s;s, &s;he met her half way, and &s;miling, a&s;ked her why &s;he had turned back?</P>
<P><Q>Oh, madam, replied &s;he, I am ready to &s;ink with confu&s;ion! what a <HI>&s;ol&s;im</HI> in good breeding have I committed! to be &s;ure you will think I have been u&s;ed to conver&s;e with &s;avages only.</Q>
Sophia, not able to gue&s;s what this &s;peech tended to, looked at Mr. Gibbons as if &s;he wi&s;hed for an explanation.</P>
<P><Q>My aunt, madam, &s;aid the youth, (blu&s;hing a little at the old woman's affectation,) is con|cerned that you &s;hould walk home alone, and
<PB N="418" REF="17">
that I can't offer my &s;ervice to attend you, being obliged to lead her, as you &s;ee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That is not all, nephew, &s;aid the ceremonious gentlewoman: you do not tell the young lady the true cau&s;e of the <HI>dilemnia</HI> I am in: I would not leave you, madam, pur&s;ued &s;he, till I &s;aw you &s;afe home, but you live with a family who has affronted me, and I cannot endure to come with|in &s;ight of the hou&s;e. I never can forgive an affront, that would be to &s;hew I do not under|&s;tand the laws of good breeding: but I thank heaven no body can charge me with that, I was very early <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> into polite life; but &s;ome people are not to be <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> with.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope, &s;aid Sophia, (&s;carce able to compo&s;e her countenance to any tolerable degree of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s) that none of Mr. Law&s;on's family have given you cau&s;e of complaint: they &s;eem to me incapable of affronting any one, much more a per&s;on that.</Q> &mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Oh, dear madam, interrupted the old lady, cour|te&s;ying low, you do me a great deal of honour; but you will find, nay you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved already, that Mrs. Law&s;on is vulgar, very vulgar, &s;he knows nothing of decorums.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am very &s;orry for this mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween you, &s;aid Sophia, and I &s;hould think it a very great happine&s;s if I could be any way u&s;eful in renewing your friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, cried Mrs. Gibbons, you might as well think of joining the <HI>Antipoles,</HI> madam, as of bringing us together again; and I am grieved
<PB N="419" REF="18">
beyond mea&s;ure when I think that it is impo&s;|&s;ible for me to wait on you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>However, an&s;wered Sophia, you will have no objection, I hope, to my coming to &s;ee you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By no means, madam, replied Mrs. Gib|bons, you came la&s;t into the country, and you are entitled to the fir&s;t vi&s;it; I would not for the world break through the laws of politene&s;s; I am &s;orry you have &s;o indifferent an opinion of my breeding.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia perceiving that the old gentlewoman was a little di&s;compo&s;ed, for this article of good breed|ing was a tender point with her, endeavoured to bring her into good humour, by &s;ome well-timed compliments, and once more took leave of her; but Mrs. Gibbons now in&s;i&s;ted upon her nephew's &s;eeing her &s;afe home, &s;aying,
<Q>She would re&s;t her|&s;elf under a tree till he came back.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia but faintly declined this civility, for &s;he feared to offend her again; and the joy that &s;parkled in William's eyes when his aunt made this offer of his attendance, made her unwilling to di&s;appoint him of the hope of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o after much ceremony on the part of Mrs. Gib|bons, they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>As they walked, Sophia took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s her concern for the violent re&s;entment his aunt had entertained again&s;t Mr. Law&s;on's family, and which &s;eemed to make a reconciliation hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>The youth told her, that nothing could be more trivial than the accident that had occa&s;ioned it; and yet, pur&s;ued he, &s;ighing deeply,
<Q>&s;light as it is, the con&s;equences are likely to be fatal enough.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="19">During their conver&s;ation Sophia di&s;covered &s;o much good &s;en&s;e and delicacy of &s;entiment in the young William, that &s;he more than ever pitied the fate of the&s;e poor lovers, who&s;e happine&s;s was &s;a|crificed to the capricious temper of an affected old woman: &s;he a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would neglect no opportunity to improve her acquaintance with his aunt:
<Q>And perhaps, &s;aid &s;he, with an inchanting &s;mile, that expre&s;&s;ed the benevolence of her heart, I may be &s;o fortunate as to effect a recon|ciliation between her and my Dolly's family.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gibbons thanked her in tran&s;ports of joy and gratitude; and now Dolly and her &s;i&s;ter, who had walked out in &s;earch of Sophia, appearing in &s;ight, &s;he mended her pace, in order to come up with them &s;oon; for in the ardent glances that William &s;ent towards his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he read his im|patience to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>Dolly, who was in the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, to &s;ee Sophia thus accompanied, took no notice of Wil|liam; but avoiding, with a &s;weet ba&s;hfulne&s;s, his earne&s;t and pa&s;&s;ionate looks: &s;he fixed her eyes on Mi&s;s Darnley, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to hear from her by what chance they had met.</P>
<P><Q>I know, &s;aid Sophia to her &s;miling, that you did not expect to &s;ee me &s;o agreeably engaged; but Mr. Gibbons can inform you how his aunt, whom we left in the fore&s;t yonder, and I became acquainted.</Q>
She then addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e to Fanny, to give the lovers an opportunity of talk|ing to each other.</P>
<P>Dolly a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning their meeting, and his aunt's behaviour to Mi&s;s Darn|ley;
<PB N="421" REF="20">
but the pa&s;&s;ionate youth leaving it to Sophia to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, employed the few moments he had to &s;tay with her in tender a&s;&s;urances of his own unaltered affection, and complaints of her indifference.</P>
<P><Q>Surely, &s;aid Dolly, with tears in her eyes, I ought not to be blamed for obeying my father.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, my dear Dolly, replied William, our af|fections are not in the power of our fathers; and if you hate me now becau&s;e your father com|mands you to do &s;o, you never loved me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hate you, cried Dolly; no, Mr. William, my father never bid me hate you; and if he had I am &s;ure I could not have obeyed him: he only commanded me to forget you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Only to forget me, repeated William, in a melancholy tone: then you think that little, Dolly; and perhaps you will be able to obey him; but be a&s;&s;ured I would rather be hated by you than forgotten.</Q></P>
<P>"That is &s;trange, indeed," &s;aid Dolly, &s;miling through her tears.</P>
<P><Q>You would not think it &s;trange, replied the youth, in an accent that expre&s;&s;ed at once grief and re&s;entment, if you had ever loved. Ah Dolly, are all your tender promi&s;es come to this! little did I imagine I &s;hould ever &s;ee you altered thus! but I will trouble you no more, added he, &s;ighing, as if his heart would break; I will endeavour to follow your example: per|haps it is not &s;o difficult a thing as I imagined to cure one's &s;elf of love; you have &s;hewn me it is po&s;&s;ible, and if I fail in the attempt I can be
<PB N="422" REF="21">
but mi&s;erable, and that you have made me now.</Q>
As he &s;poke the&s;e words, he turned half from her, and let fall &s;ome tears.</P>
<P>Dolly, who had no intention to make him un|ea&s;y, was exce&s;&s;ively affected with this &s;ight, and not a little alarmed at what he had &s;aid:
<Q>And will you try to forget me, &s;aid &s;he, in the mo&s;t moving tone imaginable; then indeed you will be fal&s;e and perjured too, for you have &s;worn a thou&s;and times that you would love me for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;ee me wretched, &s;aid he; you have re&s;olved to love me no longer, and it is but rea&s;onable that I &s;hould try to forget you.</Q></P>
<P>He would have proceeded in this &s;train; but turning to look on her, he &s;aw her &s;weet face over&s;pread with tears.
<Q>Oh my Dolly, cried he, we are very cruel to each other; but I am mo&s;t to blame: can you pardon me, my deare&s;t: &s;ay you can; alas, I know I do not de&s;erve it.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly's heart was &s;o oppre&s;t that &s;he was not able to &s;peak; but &s;he held out her hand to her young lover, who &s;eizing it eagerly, pre&s;t it to his lips,
<Q>Yes, I will love you, &s;aid he, though you &s;hould hate me; I will love you to my late&s;t breath.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly perceiving Sophia and her &s;i&s;ter coming up to them, drew away her hand ha&s;tily; but looked on him at the &s;ame time, with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s: Sophia told him with a &s;mile, that &s;he was afraid his aunt would be impatient: upon which he made his bow, and ha&s;tened back to her.</P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="22">Fanny now left her &s;i&s;ter alone with Mi&s;s Darn|ley, who perceiving that &s;he had been weeping, a&s;ked her tenderly the cau&s;e.
<Q>Oh my dear mi&s;s, &s;aid the poor girl, blu&s;hing and pre&s;&s;ing her hand, if I had but a little of your prudence and good &s;en&s;e, I &s;hould obey my father better; but when one has once given one's heart, it is very dif|ficult to recal it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Very true, my dear, &s;aid Sophia; therefore one ought not to be in ha&s;te to give it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope, interupted Dolly with an anxious look, you have ob&s;erved nothing in Mr. William to make you change your good opinion of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Quite the contrary, &s;aid Sophia, I believe him to be a good, and I am &s;ure he is a &s;en&s;ible youth: nay more, I believe he has a &s;incere regard for you; and that, pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;ighing, is &s;aying a great deal, con&s;idering what rea&s;on I have to judge unfavourably of men: but, my dear, I would have you keep your pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far &s;ub|jected to your rea&s;on, as to make it not too dif|ficult for you to obey your father, if he is fully determined to refu&s;e his content.</Q>
I know, added &s;he, with a gentle &s;mile,
<Q>That it is ea&s;ier to be wi&s;e for others than for our&s;elves; but I know it is not impo&s;&s;ible for a heart in love to follow the dictates of rea&s;on: I think &s;o highly of Mr. Law&s;on's under&s;tanding and good|ne&s;s, that I am per&s;uaded he would not lay an unrea&s;onable command upon you, and by what I could collect from &s;ome hints dropt by Mrs. Gibbons, and the little di&s;cour&s;e I had with your lover, the old gentlewoman is wholly to blame.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="23">
<Q>Did Mr. William tell you, &s;aid Dolly, what was the occa&s;ion of their quarrel?</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, replied Sophia: I &s;hould be glad to hear it from your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, re&s;umed Dolly, taking her under the arm, let us go to our dear oak then, and there we &s;hall be out of &s;ight; but I am impatient to know how you met, and what conver&s;ation you had.</Q>
Sophia &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity, divert|ing her&s;elf a little with the old lady's hard words, and her &s;trict regard to ceremony.</P>
<P><Q>Ah, &s;aid Dolly, it was tho&s;e hard words, and the clutter &s;he made about ceremony and de|corum, that occa&s;ioned all our unhappine&s;s; for as I told you, mi&s;s, &s;he was well enough plea&s;ed with her nephew's choice, &s;aying, that he was in the right to marry like a gentleman, and pre|fer per&s;on and breeding to money: however, &s;oon after &s;he came into the country, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf a little di&s;&s;atisfied with my education, and &s;aid, that as my father was a gentleman and a &s;cholar, he ought to have taught his daughters a little Greek and Latin, to have di&s;tingui&s;hed them from meer country girls.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your mother, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Sophia, laughed at this notion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It does not become me, &s;aid Dolly, to blame my mother; but to be &s;ure &s;he took great delight in ridiculing Mrs. Gibbons: indeed it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to help &s;miling now and then at her hard words, and her formal politene&s;s; but my mother, as Mr. William often told me with great concern, carried her raillery &s;o far that
<PB N="425" REF="24">
his aunt would certainly be offended with it at la&s;t; and &s;o indeed &s;he was, and grew every day cooler, with regard to the marriage. This di&s;|gu&s;ted my mother more, &s;o every thing wore a melancholy appearance: at length Mrs. Gibbons broke out one day violently, upon my mother's &s;ending a di&s;h of tea to another gentlewoman before her. I &s;aw a &s;torm in her countenance, and dreading the con&s;equence, I made ha&s;te to carry her, her di&s;h my&s;elf, but &s;he refu&s;ed it &s;cornfully, and then began to attack my mother in her &s;trange language, upon her want of breed|ing, and ignorance of the rules of <HI>precendency,</HI> that was her word. My mother at fir&s;t only laughed, and rallied; but when the re&s;t of our vi&s;itors was gone, and Mrs. Gibbons only remained, the quar|rel grew &s;erious. My mother, who was out of patience with her folly, &s;aid &s;ome &s;evere things, which provoked Mrs. Gibbons &s;o much, that &s;he ro&s;e up in a fury, and declared &s;he would never more have any <HI>collection</HI> with &s;uch vulgar crea|tures. At that moment my father and Mr. William, who had been walking together, came into the room: they both were exce&s;&s;ively &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the di&s;order that appeared among us; and poor Mr. William, who was mo&s;t apprehen|&s;ive, turned as pale as death: he gave me a me|lancholy look, as fearing what had happened, and had &s;carce courage enough to a&s;k his aunt what was the matter? Mean time, my mother, in a laughing way gave my father an account of what had happened, repeating &s;ome of Mrs. Gibbons's &s;trange words, and made the whole affair appear
<PB N="426" REF="25">
&s;o ridiculous, that Mrs. Gibbons in a great fury, flung out of the hou&s;e, declaring that from that moment &s;he broke off any <HI>treati&s;e</HI> of marriage between her nephew and me; and that, if he con|tinued to make his addre&s;&s;es to me, &s;he would make a will and leave all her money to a di&s;tant relation. Mr. William was obliged to follow his aunt; but he begged my father's leave to re|turn as &s;oon as he had &s;een her &s;afe home. When he came back, he implor'd my father, with tears in his eyes, not to forbid his &s;eeing me: he &s;aid the lo&s;s of his aunt's fortune would give him no concern if he dur&s;t hope that it would make no alteration in my father's re&s;olutions, &s;ince his own little inheritance was &s;ufficient to maintain us comfortably. My father was plea&s;ed with his generous affection for me, and &s;aid a great many obliging things to him, as did my mother likewi&s;e, &s;o that we thought our misfortune not &s;o bad; but the next day old Mr. Gibbons came plodding to our hou&s;e, and with a great deal of confu&s;ion and aukwardne&s;s, told my fa|ther that he was very &s;orry for what had happened; but &s;i&s;ter had changed her mind, and would not let her nephew marry, and he was afraid if he di&s;obliged her &s;he would leave all her money to &s;trangers; &s;o he begged him to give his &s;on no encouragement, but to tell him plainly he mu&s;t obey his aunt and his father; and he &s;aid he was &s;ure his &s;on would mind what my father &s;aid to him more than any body el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am in pain for poor Mr. Law&s;on, &s;aid So|phia. What a boori&s;h &s;peech was this!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="26">
<Q>My father, re&s;um'd Dolly, &s;aid afterwards, that if it had not been for the concern he felt for me and Mr. William, he would have been ex|ce&s;&s;ively diverted with the old man's &s;implicity; but he an&s;wered him gravely and with great civi|lity: he promi&s;ed him that the affair &s;hould go no farther; that I &s;hould receive no more vi&s;its from his &s;on; and that he would talk with him, and endeavour to make him &s;ubmit patiently to what his father and his aunt had determined for him. The old man thanked my father a thou&s;and times over for his kindne&s;s, and after a great many bows and &s;crapes he went away. My father was as good as his word: he laid his commands on me to think no more of Mr. Wil|liam, and forbad me to &s;ee or &s;peak to him; and when Mr. William came next, he took him with him into his &s;tudy and talked to him a long time. He acknowledged that Mr. William had oftener than once moved him even to tears; but for all that he did not relent, and we were not allowed &s;o much as to &s;peak to each other alone, for fear we &s;hould take any mea&s;ures to meet in private. This I thought very &s;evere, pur&s;ued Dolly, &s;ighing, we might at lea&s;t have been in|dulged in taking leave, &s;ince we were to be &s;e|parated for ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot blame your father, &s;aid Sophia, he was indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to act as he did: it is to be wi&s;hed indeed that Mrs. Law&s;on had pa&s;|&s;ed over the poor woman's follies with more temper; but this cannot be helped now: per|haps I may be able to &s;erve you. The old gentle|woman
<PB N="428" REF="27">
&s;eems to have taken a liking to me; I &s;hall endeavour to improve it, that I may have an opportunity to &s;often her: it is not impo&s;|&s;ible but this matter may end well yet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Poor Dolly was ready enough to admit a hope &s;o plea&s;ing, and felt her heart more at ea&s;e than it had been a long time. As for William, his aunt's extravagant prai&s;es of Sophia, and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which &s;he dropped, intimating that &s;he &s;hould be plea&s;ed if he could make him&s;elf acceptable to &s;o fine a lady, hinted to him a &s;cheme which might afford him the means of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ometimes: he &s;eemed there|fore to li&s;ten with &s;atisfaction to the&s;e dark over|tures made by his aunt, and upon her &s;peaking &s;till plainer, he &s;aid it would be pre&s;umption in him to think that a young lady &s;o accompli&s;hed as Mi&s;s Darnley would look down upon him; and be&s;ides, he had no opportunity of improving an acquaintance with her, being forbid Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, at her reque&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The old woman, plea&s;ed to find he made &s;o little oppo&s;ition to her de&s;ire, told him,
<Q>That he would have opportunities enough of &s;eeing and con|ver&s;ing with the lady; &s;he often walks out, &s;aid &s;he, either in the fore&s;t or the fields about the hou&s;e: cannot you throw your&s;elf in her way, and acco&s;t her politely, as you very well know how; and, to <HI>felicitate</HI> your &s;ucce&s;s, I will let her know that I am willing to receive the honour of a vi&s;it from her, though this is again&s;t all the rules of decorum, for it is my part to vi&s;it her fir&s;t, &s;he being the greate&s;t &s;tranger here: you
<PB N="429" REF="28">
&s;hall deliver my me&s;&s;age to her to-morrow your|&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The youth replied, coldly, that it was po&s;|&s;ible he might not meet with her to-morrow: ne|verthele&s;s he would go every day to the fore&s;t, and wherever it was likely &s;he would walk, in hopes of &s;eeing her.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons, exulting in the hope of mortify|ing Mrs. Law&s;on, told her nephew,
<Q>That if he could &s;ucceed in his addre&s;&s;es to mi&s;s Darnley, and give her &s;o fine a lady for a niece, &s;he would &s;ettle the be&s;t part of her fortune on him im|mediately.</Q></P>
<P>William &s;uffered her to plea&s;e her&s;elf with the&s;e imaginations, having &s;ecured the liberty of going un&s;u&s;pected, and as often as he plea&s;ed, to tho&s;e places where he could &s;ee his beloved Dolly; hitherto he had not dared to indulge him&s;elf fre|quently in the&s;e &s;tolen interviews, le&s;t his aunt being informed of them, &s;hould take mea&s;ures to engage Mr. Law&s;on to keep his daughter under a greater re&s;traint; but now he continually haunted the park, the wood, and the fields about Mr. Law|&s;on's hou&s;e: here he could not fail of often &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes of &s;peaking to her unob&s;erved by any one.</P>
<P>Dolly never failed to chide him as often as this happened, for thus laying her under a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;obeying her father's injunctions; but &s;he took no pains to &s;hun tho&s;e places where &s;he was al|mo&s;t &s;ure of meeting him; and her chiding was &s;o gentle, that he was convinced &s;he was not greatly offended.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="29">Sophia happening to meet him one morning, while he was thus &s;auntering about, &s;he enquired for his aunt, and hearing from him how de&s;irous the old gentlewoman was of &s;eeing her, &s;he who was full of her benevolent &s;cheme, and eager to put it in execution, delayed her vi&s;it no longer than till the afternoon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons con&s;idered this as a proof of her ne|phew's &s;incerity, and was in &s;o good a humour, that &s;he li&s;tened without any &s;igns of di&s;plea&s;ure, to the prai&s;es which Sophia artfully introduced of Dolly; and even &s;ometimes joined in them: Sophia thought this a very favourable beginning, and went away full of hope that &s;he &s;hould &s;ucced in her de&s;ign: but while &s;he was thus endeavouring to make others happy, her &s;i&s;ter was preparing a new mortification for her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles continued to vi&s;it Mrs. Darnley as u&s;ual: he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours every day at her hou&s;e, and while he applauded him&s;elf for the &s;teadine&s;s of his re&s;olution, not to follow his mi&s;tre&s;s, he per|ceived not his own weakne&s;s in &s;eeking every alle|viation of her ab&s;ence. He went to the hou&s;e where &s;he had formerly dwelt, becau&s;e every object he &s;aw in it brought her dear idea to his mind: he loved to turn over the books he had &s;een her read, to &s;it in tho&s;e places where &s;he u&s;ed to &s;it: he was tran&s;ported when he &s;aw any thing that be|longed to her; and when he was not ob&s;erved by the inqui&s;itive eyes of Harriot, he indulged his own in gazing upon Sophia's picture, faintly as it ex|pre&s;&s;ed the attractive graces of the original: he endured the trifling di&s;cour&s;e of Mrs, Darnley
<PB N="431" REF="30">
and the in&s;ipid gaiety of Harriot, and left all other company and amu&s;ements to conver&s;e with them, that he might hear &s;omething concerning Sophia; for he had the art, without &s;eeming to de&s;ign it, to turn the di&s;cour&s;e frequently upon her, and thus drew from the loquacious mother all he de|&s;ired to know, without appearing to be intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley knew not what judgment to form of his a&s;&s;iduity in vi&s;iting her, and vainly endeavour|ed to penetrate into his views. As for Harriot, who had no idea of tho&s;e refinements of tenderne&s;s which influenced Sir Charles's conduct on this oc|ca&s;ion, &s;he concluded that her charms had once more en&s;laved him, and exulted in her fancied conque&s;t the more, as it was a triumph over her &s;i&s;ter, who had been the occa&s;ion of &s;o many mor|tifications to her.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o ea&s;y or &s;o fallacious as the belief that we are beloved and admired; our own va|nity helps the deceit, where a deceit is intended: and a coquet who has a double portion of it, wil|lingly deceives her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Harriot was now fully per&s;uaded that Sir Charles had forgot Sophia, and was wholly devoted to her. Impatient to in&s;ult her with the news of his change, &s;he propo&s;ed to her mother to make her a vi&s;it: Mrs. Darnley immediately con&s;ented, not be|cau&s;e &s;he was very de&s;irous to &s;ee her daughter, but becau&s;e every thing that wore the face of amu&s;ement was always acceptable to her. Sir Charles, upon being made acquainted with their
<PB N="432" REF="31">
intention, offered to accommodate them with his chariot; and although he only de&s;ired them coldly to pre&s;ent his compliments to Sophia, yet when he reflected that they would &s;oon &s;ee and conver&s;e with her, he could not help envying their hap|pine&s;s; and it was with great difficulty he con|quered him&s;elf &s;o far as to forbear going with them.</P>

<P>Hi&s;torians have not told us in what manner the Britains &s;u&s;tained them&s;elves again&s;t &s;uch numbers of invaders, till Severus was &s;ent to their relief in the year 368. But neither Severus, nor his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or Jovinus were able to vye with the barbari|ans, who were now di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole kingdom, and had made great deva&s;tations in the city of London. Valentinian &s;aw an im|mediate nece&s;&s;ity for a reinforcement of troops under the conduct of a veteran and experienced commander: he cho&s;e Theodo&s;ius, as a man of great experience, and of a mo&s;t martial character. Theodo&s;ius lo&s;t no time in executing his commi&s;|&s;ion: he &s;et &s;ail from Boulogne, and landed at Sandwich, with the choice&s;t troops that could be gathered throughout the continent. He marched directly to London, and found the city in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. He immediately relieved the me|tropolis; and, by a divi&s;ion of his army into dif|ferent parties, &s;urpri&s;ed the lawle&s;s freebooters in &s;everal places, and dive&s;ted them of their plun|der, which con&s;i&s;ted of captives and herds of cattle. For &s;ome time afterwards he cho&s;e rather to ob&s;erve than to mole&s;t his adver&s;aries. His caution and &s;agacity, joined to the force of his arms, at length entirely effected the purpo&s;es for which he was deputed into the kingdom. By de|grees he drove back the Picts, the Scots, and all the invaders into their own territories: he replaced garri&s;ons to defend the boundaries; he repaired walls, and re&s;tored cities; and, at his return to
<PB N="435" REF="34">
Rome, he left the i&s;land in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and peace. He was attended to the &s;hore by va&s;t numbers of Romans and Britons, all full of ex|pre&s;&s;ions of regret and &s;orrow at his departure. He was received by his imperial ma&s;ter with the mo&s;t public demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip, gratitude, and affection: honours which he mo&s;t ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The emperor Valentinian died in the year <HI>375.</HI> He was &s;ucceeded in the we&s;tern empire by his &s;on Gratianus, a young man addicted to plea&s;ures, re&s;igned to favourites, and in every re&s;pect unfit for his dignity. As only chance of birth had made him an emperor, and as nature had given him abilities only for a hunt&s;man, he &s;oon found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ummoning a coadjutor to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. He cho&s;e Flavius Magnus Theodo&s;ius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theodo&s;ius the father was put to death by the emperor Valens, becau&s;e <HI>Theod</HI> were the fir&s;t letters of his name. A prophet had foretold, that a man who&s;e name began with tho&s;e letters &s;hould be emperor. Valens cut off the prophet's head, and murdered all tho&s;e who&s;e names began with <HI>Theod.</HI></NOTE>, the &s;on of the Roman general, who, not many years before, had made &s;o con&s;iderable a figure in Britain.</P>
<P>At the time when the emperor Gratianus made this choice, Maximus, a Spaniard by birth, of a very noble family, and an officer of great merit and di&s;tinction, was at the head of the Roman ar|my in Britain. He was per&s;onally beloved by the &s;oldiers, and had rendered him&s;elf much e&s;teemed and revered among the Britons. All his military actions had been planned upon the model of that great general Theodo&s;ius, by whom he had been left in Britain, in a high po&s;t of command. Soon
<PB N="436" REF="35">
afterwards, probably in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he became the captain-general of the Roman and Bri|ti&s;h forces. Maximus was of an ambitious tem|per, and he was much di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;udden ri&s;e of the younger Theodo&s;ius. He complained loudly of the inju&s;tice which he &s;uffered by the election of any other emperor than him&s;elf: he drew his preten&s;ions from his near degree of affinity to Con|&s;tantine the Great: and his army, without an exa|mination into the truth or fal&s;hood of tho&s;e preten|&s;ions, immediately &s;aluted him Cae&s;ar, and offered to him their &s;ervice and obedience.</P>
<P>In what a &s;tate of confu&s;ion were the Romans and the Britons at this period? little able to help them&s;elves, much le&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t their allies: two em|perors in Italy, and one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flavius Magnus Clemens Maximus.</NOTE> ri&s;en up on a &s;udden in Britain. The account of the&s;e times is very ela|borately, although in many points very differently, &s;et forth by the Scotch and Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. But the pro&s;pect we receive from all tho&s;e commen|taries are only melancholy, and various views of rage and blood&s;hed. Revolutions upon revolutions. Gratianus killed by the troops of Maximus; Max|imus put to death by Theodo&s;ius; Britain invaded by the Scots and Picts; the Scots extirpated by the Picts from Scotland, and driven into Ireland; in the continent, a declining empire; in our own i&s;land, a perpetual civil war; throughout the world, an iron age.</P>

<P><PB N="437" REF="36">Such was the di&s;mal &s;cene, &s;ome little intervals excepted, during the whole reign of Theodo&s;ius, who died in the beginning of the year 395. He left two &s;ons, Arcadius and Honorius. The we&s;|tern empire fell to the lot of Honorius, who was only ten years of age at the death of his father: he was committed to the tuition and conduct of Sti|lico. Under his government the Saxons, Scots, and Picts, tho&s;e perpetual invaders of the Briti&s;h territories, were effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and repul&s;ed.</P>
<P>But Stilico was called off from his attention to the affairs of Britain, by the appearance of Ala|ric <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alaric was rather general than king of the Goths. He was one of the mo&s;t formidable enemies of the Roman em|pire. He &s;ack'd Rome it&s;elf A. D. 4O9.</NOTE> in Italy at the head of a mo&s;t numerous army of Goths. The Roman troops were immediately &s;ummoned to the continent; as not only the em|pire, but the whole world &s;eemed to be in danger of ruin, and was afterwards over run by this &s;et of barbarians.</P>
<P>Here, I think, may be dated the end of the Roman government in Britain. Some a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ome legions were &s;ent now and then, upon the &s;upplication of the Britons in the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, to relieve them from immediate de&s;truc|tion; but &s;uch &s;uccours were few, uncertain, and at la&s;t ab&s;olutely withdrawn.</P>
<P>At this particular period, let us endeavour to take a general retro&s;pect of the Britons; their manners, their laws, and their government, as far as the ob&s;curity, and the many cha&s;ms of our hi&s;|tory will allow the &s;earch.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="37">Cae&s;ar and many other authors de&s;cribe the ori|ginal Britons appearing in the wilde&s;t &s;tate of na|ture: &s;avages living upon plunder, inhabiting woods and mountains, and ignorant of all laws and order. The de&s;cription, I am afraid, is in many in&s;tances too true; but however licentious and untamed the&s;e barbarians may have been, &s;ome form of government certainly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a|mong&s;t them, e&s;pecially, as Cae&s;ar him&s;elf &s;ays, that the cu&s;toms of the Britons were almo&s;t the &s;ame as the cu&s;toms of the Gauls.

<P>In his account of the Gauls, he tells us in how great a degree of obedience the lower cla&s;&s;es of people were held by the nobility; an obedi|ence which could not have been formed or regu|lated without a complete and acknowledged &s;y&s;tem of laws. The particulars of tho&s;e laws are not perfectly a&s;certained: they were always compo&s;ed by the Druids, who never &s;uffered any of their in&s;titutions to be committed to writing.</P>

<P>The learning, and the religious tenets of the Druids are &s;pecified in various authors. Diogenes Laertius a&s;&s;ures us, that their chief precepts were
<Q>the wor&s;hip of the Gods; an ab&s;tinence from all kinds of evil; and a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of manly fortitude.</Q></P>
<P>Pomponius Mela informs us, that the Druids were remarkably expert in geography and a&s;trono|my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the Eubates, or lowe&s;t order of Druids.</NOTE>: and Cae&s;ar &s;ays, that they taught the tran&s;|migration of &s;ouls, and by that means in&s;pired their di&s;ciples with an ab&s;olute contempt of death, which, in their articles of faith, was looked upon only as a pa&s;&s;age from one body to another; or, as Mr. Rowe expre&s;&s;es it from Lucan's de&s;cription of the Druids,

The Bards were a lower order of the Druids: their &s;acerdotal employments were the celebration of the Briti&s;h heroes in ver&s;es, which they &s;ung to the harp; and which were probably compo&s;ed to excite emulation in the hearers of their poetry.

governors, legates, and pro-praetors, till Agricola lightened and diver&s;ified, if he did not remove the oppre&s;&s;ion. In the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, the Caledonians and the Britons were mo&s;t firmly united, and the con&s;equence of their union had almo&s;t produced a total extirpation of the Romans. Adrian <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Succe&s;&s;or of Trajan.</NOTE>, probably with a de&s;ign to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;agreement between the two nations, enlarged the frontiers of the Scots, permitted them to come forwarder towards the &s;outh, and re&s;igned to them that portion of lands, which, in the time of the elder Theodo&s;ius, was di&s;tingui&s;hed as a fifth pro|vince, and was called Valentia. The Meatae and the Picti &s;ettled them&s;elves in this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Whatever might be Adrian's motives, di&s;&s;en&s;ion grew up mo&s;t pro&s;perou&s;ly, and rooted it&s;elf &s;o firmly and deeply in the &s;oil, that no a&s;&s;ociation was afterwards formed between the Britons and the Caledonians. By the Caledonians, I would be un|der&s;tood to mean tbe inhabitants of Scotland; whether di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Picts, Me|atae, Scots, Scythians, or any other denominati|ons. To fix the time of their arrival, and their &s;ettlement in Great Britain, is difficult, if not im|po&s;&s;ible: the inquiry is now intirely u&s;ele&s;s. Their wars, their incur&s;ions, their depredations, and their policy are points to reflect &s;ome entertainment; their origin, and the fabulous tales that attend it, mu&s;t in general be de&s;pi&s;ed and forgotten.</P>
<P>The Caledonians, ever a crafty, and a wi&s;e na|tion, had ta&s;ted the &s;weets, and had experienced
<PB N="443" REF="42">
the advantages ari&s;ing from frequent inroads into Britain. Their own country was barren and un|cultivated: the adjoining territories were rich and fruitful: their gains, con&s;equently, might be great; their lo&s;&s;es could only amount to a repul&s;e. Cae&s;ar tells us, that the Britons thought it unlawful to ta&s;te hares, hens, or gee&s;e, of which they kept great plenty for their plea&s;ure and diver&s;ion: the Ca|ledonians had no &s;uch &s;cruple of ta&s;te or con&s;cience. The Briti&s;h fowl, their game of all kinds, and their numerous herds of cattle, were a &s;ort of plun|der ea&s;ily taken, and as ea&s;ily carried away: and the&s;e tempting objects of ho&s;tility drew the Sax|ons and the Hibernians almo&s;t annually acro&s;s the &s;ea, in &s;earch of prizes and acqui&s;itions from Bri|tain. They were con&s;tantly joined and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Picts and the Meatae; &s;o that a variety of re|peated inva&s;ions totally employ the fir&s;t annals of our hi&s;tory, and leave us &s;carce any other charac|teri&s;tical idea of our forefathers than their bravery and re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Early in the fifth century, the Romans, now grown &s;o weak as to perceive within them&s;elves evi|dent &s;ymptoms of di&s;&s;olution, took a la&s;t farewel of our ance&s;tors; and, like expiring friends, ex|erted their la&s;t efforts, amid&s;t convul&s;ive pangs, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct the Britons how to build a wall of &s;tone in the &s;ame &s;ituation where the wall of Severus had formerly &s;tood: and &s;till, as a final in&s;tance of their friend&s;hip, they advi&s;ed the natives to prac|ti&s;e the art of war, and to become expert and re|gular in military di&s;cipline; but mo&s;t e&s;pecially to act upon one general confederate plan, by making

u&s;e of their own collective &s;trength again&s;t the Ca|ledonians and all other invaders. The advice was excellent, and, if pur&s;ued with con&s;tancy and firm|ne&s;s, might have rendered the Britons for ever im|pregnable to their enemies. But unanimity among Britons was re&s;erved for di&s;tant times, and the hap|pie&s;t age that our i&s;land has ever known.</P>
<P>By the departure of the Romans, the Britons looked upon them&s;elves as delivered from their fir&s;t conquerors: but they little con&s;idered that they were &s;till &s;ubject to a wor&s;e &s;et of tyrants, their own pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;union: no people upon earth are formed with more acute &s;en&s;ations, or deeper re|&s;entments again&s;t each other. The&s;e are the cau&s;es that fill our hi&s;tory with &s;uch frequent revolutions. Our climate is a repre&s;entation of our nature: it is uncertain, and in the &s;pace of one week affords as much variety of weather as is known in other countries throughout a twelvemonth. A &s;ingle day is often a &s;cene of &s;ummer and of winter; and of great heat and of violent cold; of rain and &s;now; and of warmth and &s;un&s;hine: &s;o various is the temperature of our air. The temperature of air governs the minds of the inhabitants: we are gloo|my or gay, &s;ullen or good-humoured, and &s;ome|times religious or immoral, according to the &s;tate and alterations of our atmo&s;phere. What mu&s;t be the effects ari&s;ing from &s;uch variegated di&s;po&s;iti|ons? continual changes, and continual di&s;content. Britons left to them&s;elves are like hor&s;es unbridled, and let out to pa&s;ture: they wince; they roar; they kick their heels towards heaven in all the wan|tonne&s;s of liberty. Their freedom might be per|petual,
<PB N="445" REF="44">
if they knew how to direct it, or were con|&s;cious of their own &s;trength; but they employ their time in &s;elf-de&s;truction: they impoliticly tread down the pa&s;ture which ought to feed them, and, incon&s;iderately &s;triking at each other, they become &s;o lame, as to &s;tand in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the fir&s;t aukward farrier who pre&s;ents him&s;elf. Gildas, I think, defines our i&s;land as a <HI>land &s;teady in nothing, and greedy of every thing new.</HI> Such, indeed, it proved after the removal of the Romans: &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive royal idols were &s;et up, wor&s;hipped, and then taken down, and trampled to pieces. The names of the&s;e molten calves are in&s;ignificant; their ac|tions, as &s;overeigns, immaterial and uncertain: they were elected, adored, and de&s;troyed. The reign of Vortigern, indeed, was of longer dura|tion, and of more con&s;equence: it afforded &s;cenes of variety and importance. We are told, that while Vortigern was upon the throne, the Britons, finding them&s;elves overpowered, and almo&s;t ruined by inva&s;ions from the Scots and Picts, &s;ent a &s;o|lemn emba&s;&s;y with mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters to im|plore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to require the immediate pre&s;ence of their old enemies the Saxons. Is it po&s;&s;ible to believe our ance&s;tors guilty of &s;o ab&s;urd a re&s;olution? That they were factious, di&s;contented, and unver&s;ed in the rules of government, is certain; but that they &s;hould imagine them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking refuge from Charybdis, be|cau&s;e they were clo&s;e upon the rocks of Scylla, is highly improbable. How indeterminate are the hi&s;torical accounts of this particular period, when the introduction of the Saxons is recorded in a
<PB N="446" REF="45">
manner that bears &s;o little re&s;emblance to truth? The Britons might not be willing, or more pro|bably might not be capable to oppo&s;e the Saxons, when tho&s;e invaders were arrived; but it is &s;carce credible to imagine that the Britons &s;ollicited their arrival. However, by the generality of hi&s;torians, we are to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;heep invited the wolves. A modern writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthrie, vol. i. p. 81.</NOTE> differs from many of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and tells us, from Nennius, that the ar|rival of the Saxons was accidental: the only fact that can be depended upon is, that <HI>they arrived.</HI> The year cannot be a&s;certained <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In all probability, about the middle of the fifth century. According to Nennius, A. D. 447.</NOTE>; in that point the chronologi&s;ts differ. But of what nation &s;hall we find the chronology a&s;certained?</P>
<P>The Saxons were commanded by two brothers, Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, men of judgment and pene|tration, who, finding their fir&s;t de&s;ign of plunder and deva&s;tation in&s;upportable, tacitly changed the plan, and offered them&s;elves as friends and confe|derates to the Britons. At &s;o critical a juncture, they were joyfully received by Vortigern, and were incorporated into the Briti&s;h army. The i&s;land of Thanet was a&s;&s;igned for their &s;ettlement: their numbers did not exceed fifteen hundred: three &s;hips tran&s;ported them into Britain.</P>
<P>Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as allies of con&s;equence. The Picts and Scots were driven back to their &s;everal territories; &s;ome to Caledonia, others to Ireland; and the Saxons re|tired to the i&s;le of Thanet with all po&s;&s;ible demon|&s;trations of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="46">The articles of compact between the Saxons and the Britons were the&s;e: <HI>That the Saxons were to fight for the Britons again&s;t all foreign enemies, and were to receive the pay and maintenance from the nation for whom they fought.</HI> In the general name of Saxons were included the Jutes and the Angles, who had enli&s;ted them&s;elves under the banner of Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a. The&s;e two brothers were the direct de&s;cendants of Woden, an A&s;iatic king, who came from Scythia into Europe, and &s;eized tho&s;e Ger|man territories that are now di&s;tingui&s;hed as Sax|ony. The Angles were inhabitants of Sweden. The Jutes were a people of Denmark. Whil&s;t the number of the&s;e Saxons did not exceed fifteen hun|dred, the articles of compact were not difficult to be fulfilled. But Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a had farther views than merely a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance from the Britons: the i&s;le of Thanet was too limited a circumference for their ambition: a &s;ettlement, and &s;ome degree of power within the greater i&s;land, were the objects upon which they had fixed their eyes. Of the two brothers, Hengi&s;t &s;eems to have been particularly vigilant and politic: he con&s;idered the fertility of the &s;oil, the inexperience of the inhabitants, and the weak pa&s;&s;ions of the king; and, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf and to his people, all the future advantages that they could wi&s;h, riches, alliance, and a kingdom. In con&s;equence of &s;uch a plan, he &s;ent for fre&s;h &s;upplies of his countrymen: and they came over in tribes &s;uffici|ently numerous to fill &s;eventeen &s;hips. With them arrived Rowena, the daughter of Hengi&s;t: her father had particularly ob&s;erved the amorous di&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="448" REF="47">
of Vortigern; and, con&s;cious of his daughter's beauty, he propo&s;ed to make her the chief &s;tep by which he was to a&s;cend. The effect an&s;wered the de&s;ign: Vortigern &s;aw the fair Saxon, divorced his lawful wife, by whom he had many children, and incontinently married Rowena. In con&s;equence of this marriage, the kingdom of Kent was allotted to the Saxons, and the dominion of that territory was taken away from Guorango|nus, the reigning prince, and was be&s;towed upon Hengi&s;t, the father-in-law of the chief &s;overeign in Britain.</P>
<P>How unhappy mu&s;t be the &s;tate of government, when the king could break through all the bounds of morality, and where the people could tamely &s;ubmit to &s;ee one of their mo&s;t con&s;iderable colo|nies peremptorily given away to &s;trangers? The&s;e in&s;tances &s;hew us, that not the lea&s;t order, and &s;carce any degree of public courage &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at this time in Britain: they &s;hew us that chri&s;tianity had not as yet taken &s;ufficient root in our i&s;land. A religion that was calculated to re&s;cue mankind from the ty|ranny of fraud and force, and in&s;tituted to give a true notion of one God, and to fix right and ju&s;|tice upon a &s;ure and natural foundation, mu&s;t have little efficacy among a wild and indocile race of men. Some churches, however, were built, and &s;ome outward appearances of religion were main|tained; but the antiquities of the&s;e times are &s;o fa|bulous, that few authentic commentaries are ex|tant, either of eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or of civil affairs.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>THE meeting between my father and me was, on my &s;ide, full of re&s;pect, but coldne&s;s and <Q>I have given you lei&s;ure, &s;aid he to me, to repent of your folly, and I am now come to give you the means to make me forget it; re|turn this in&s;tance of my indulgence with obe|dience, and prepare to receive as you ought, the count of Foix, and mademoi&s;elle de Foix his daughter, for whom I have de&s;tined you. The marriage &s;hall be &s;olemnized here; they will ar|rive to-morrow with your mother; I came before them only to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders for their reception.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry, Sir, replied I calmly, that I cannot comply with your wi&s;hes: I have too much ho|nour to marry a per&s;on I can never love, there|fore I intreat you will permit me to leave this
<PB N="450" REF="49">
place directly. Mademoi&s;elle de Foix, however amiable &s;he may be, cannot alter my re&s;olution; and if I &s;ee her, the affront I &s;hall give her by refu&s;ing her hand, will be more poignant to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, interrupted my father in a rage, thou &s;halt not &s;ee her, nor &s;halt thou be allowed to &s;ee the day; I will &s;hut thee up in a dungeon, a fitter habitation. I &s;wear by heaven, that thou &s;halt never be delivered from thy confinement, till I am convinced thy repentance is &s;incere, and thy change certain. I will puni&s;h thee for thy di&s;obedience every way that is in my power; I will deprive thee of my e&s;tate, and &s;ettle it up|on mademoi&s;elle de Foix, to fulfil, in &s;ome de|gree, the promi&s;e I have given her.</Q></P>
<P>I made no oppo&s;ition to my father's tyrannical de&s;ign; I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be conducted to an old tower, where I was confined in a place at the bot|tom of it, which received no light but from a little grated window which looked into one of the courts of the ca&s;tle. My father gave orders that food &s;hould be brought me twice a-day, but that I &s;hould not be &s;uffered to &s;ee any per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t days of my confinement with tranquility enough, and even with &s;ome kind of plea&s;ure. What I had &s;o lately done for Adelaida employed all my thoughts, and left no room for reflection on the horrors of my condition; but when this &s;entiment began to lo&s;e its force, I re|&s;igned my&s;elf up to de&s;pair at being thus doomed to an ab&s;ence of which I knew not the end. My bu&s;y imagination tortured me with the apprehen&s;ion of a thou&s;and other evils: Adelaida might be forced
<PB N="451" REF="50">
to enter into another engagement: I fancied her &s;urrounded with rivals, all a&s;&s;iduous to plea&s;e, while I had none to plead for me but my mi&s;eries; but to a mind &s;o generous as Adelaida's, was not this &s;ufficient? I reproached my&s;elf for entertaining the lea&s;t doubt; I asked her pardon for it, as for a crime, and my heart gathered new &s;trength from the confidence I had in her fidelity.</P>
<P>My mother found means to convey a letter to my hands, in which &s;he exhorted me to &s;ubmit to my father, who&s;e rage again&s;t me &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e every day. She added, that &s;he &s;uffered a great deal her&s;elf; that her endeavours to pro|cure a reconciliation between him and the family of Lu&s;&s;an had made him &s;u&s;pect that &s;he acted in concert with me.</P>
<P>I was greatly affected at the unea&s;ine&s;s my mo|ther &s;uffered on my account; but as I could not accu&s;e my&s;elf of having voluntarily cau&s;ed her any part of it, all I could do was to lament her &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>One day when I was, as u&s;ual, wholly taken up with reflections on my unhappy fate, &s;omething fell through the window into my dungeon, which im|mediately rouzed my attention. I &s;aw a letter on the floor, I &s;eized it with trembling ha&s;te; but what became of me when I read the contents! they were as follow:
<Q>Your father's rage has in&s;tructed me what I ought to do. I know the terrible &s;ituation you are in, and I know but one method to extricate you from it, which will perhaps make you more mi&s;erable; but I &s;hall be &s;o as well as you, and that thought will give me re&s;olution to do
<PB N="452" REF="51">
what is required of me. Our cruel parents, to make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be yours, in&s;i&s;t up|on my marrying another. This is the price your father has &s;et upon your liberty; it will perhaps co&s;t me my life, my quiet it too &s;urely will, to pay it: but I am determined. Your &s;ufferings and your pri&s;on are at pre&s;ent all that I can think of: in a few days I &s;hall be the wife of the marquis de Benavides; his character is &s;ufficient to acquaint me with all I have to &s;uffer from him; but this &s;ort of fidelity I owe you, at lea&s;t that in the engagement I enter into, I &s;hould find nothing but mi&s;ery. May you, on the contrary, be hap|py; your good fortune will be my con&s;olation. I am &s;en&s;ible I ought not to tell you this: if I was truly generous I &s;hould &s;uffer you to be ignorant of the part you have in my marriage; I &s;hould leave you in doubt of my con&s;tancy. I had formed a de&s;ign to do &s;o, but I was not able to ex|ecute it: in my &s;ad &s;ituation I have need of being &s;upported with the thought that the remem|brance of me will not be hateful to you. Alas! &s;oon, very &s;oon it will not be permitted me to pre&s;erve yours.&mdash;I mu&s;t forget you;&mdash;at lea&s;t I mu&s;t endeavour &s;o to do.&mdash;Of all my mi&s;eries this is what I am mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of: you will in|crea&s;e it if you do not carefully avoid all op|portunities of &s;eeing and &s;peaking to me. Re|flect that you owe me this mark of your e&s;teem, and oh! reflect how dear that e&s;teem will be to me, &s;ince of all the &s;entiments you have profe&s;t for me, it is the only one that I am allowed to require of you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="52">Of this fatal letter, which I have related at length, I was able to read no more than to the&s;e words:
<Q>Our cruel parents, to make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be yours, in&s;i&s;t upon my marrying another.</Q>
Pierced to the heart with this cruel, this unex|pected misfortune, I &s;unk upon the mattra&s;s which compo&s;ed my bed, and lay there &s;everal hours without &s;en&s;e or motion, and probably might never have recovered, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the per|&s;on who brought me my provi&s;ions. If he was alarmed at the condition in which he found me, he was much more &s;o at the exce&s;s of my de&s;pair, when my &s;en&s;es returned. The letter, which I held fa&s;t in my hand during my &s;woon, and which I at la&s;t read quite through, was wet with my tears, and I &s;poke and acted extravagancies which made him apprehen&s;ive for my rea&s;on.</P>
<P>This man, who till then had been inacce&s;&s;ible to pity, was melted all on a &s;udden: he blamed my father for his cruel treatment of me; he reproved him&s;elf for having executed his orders; he a&s;ked my pardon on his knees. His repentance in&s;pired me with the thought of propo&s;ing to him to let me quit my pri&s;on for eight days only, promi&s;ing him that, at the expiration of that time, I would return and put my&s;elf into his hands: I added every thing I could think of to oblige him to con|&s;ent. Moved at the &s;tate he &s;aw me in, excited by his own intere&s;t, and by the fear that I &s;hould one day take vengeance upon him for being the in|&s;trument of my father's cruelty, he agreed to what I de&s;ired, upon the condition I had my&s;elf propo&s;ed to him.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="53">I would have &s;et out that moment from the ca&s;tle, but there was a nece&s;&s;ity for his going to &s;eek for hor&s;es; and when he returned, he informed me that we could not get any till the next day. My de&s;ign was to go to Adelaida, to tell her all my grief and de&s;pair, and to kill my&s;elf before her eyes, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>To execute this project, it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould arrive before her fatal marriage, and every moment's delay &s;eemed to me an age of mi&s;ery. I read over her letter a hundred times, as if I had expected to find &s;till &s;omething more in it. I ex|amined the date over and over; I flattered my&s;elf that the time might have been prolonged.
<Q>She will at lea&s;t make an effort, &s;aid I; &s;he will &s;eize all pretences to defer it. But why &s;hould I flat|ter my&s;elf with &s;o vain a hope, re&s;umed I? Ade|laida &s;acrificing her&s;elf for my liberty will ha&s;ten the dreadful moment. Alas! can &s;he believe that liberty without her, can be a ble&s;&s;ing to me? I &s;hall every where find this pri&s;on &s;he delivers me from; &s;he has never known my heart; &s;he judges of me by other men: it is to that I owe my ruin. I am &s;till more mi&s;erable than I be|lieved my&s;elf, &s;ince I have not the con&s;olation to think that &s;he knows how much I love her.</Q></P>
<P>I pa&s;t the whole night in making the&s;e com|plaints, the mo&s;t tedious night I had ever known, even in that place of mi&s;ery. At length the day appeared; I mounted on hor&s;eback with my con|ductor. We travelled the whole day without &s;top|ping a moment, when, towards the evening, I per|ceived my mother in a chariot which took the road
<PB N="455" REF="54">
towards the ca&s;tle. She knew me immediately, and, after having expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize at meet|ing me, &s;he obliged me to come into the chariot to her. I dur&s;t not ask her the occa&s;ion of her jour|ney in the &s;ituation I was in; I feared every thing, and my fear was but too well founded.</P>
<P><Q>I come, my &s;on, &s;aid &s;he, by your father's permi&s;&s;ion, to relea&s;e you from your confine|ment.</Q>
<Q>Ah! cried I, then Adelaida is mar|ried.</Q>
My mother an&s;wered only by &s;ilence. My misfortune which was then without remedy, pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind with all its horrid aggra|vations. I fell into a kind of &s;tupidity, and, by the force of grief, I &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of it. However, my body now &s;unk under the weakne&s;s of my mind: I was &s;eized in the coach with a &s;hivering like the cold fit of an ague. As &s;oon as we arrived at the ca&s;tle, my mother cau&s;ed me to be put to bed. I lay two days without &s;peaking or taking any nouri&s;hment; all the &s;ymp|toms of a violent fever appeared, and, on the fourth, the phy&s;ician de&s;paired of my life. My mother who never left me, was inconceiveably af|flicted; her tears, her prayers, and the name of Adelaida, by which &s;he conjured me to live, made me re&s;olve not to ob&s;truct the endeavours of the phy&s;ician to &s;ave me.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF BIANCA CAPELLO CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>THE polite behaviour and promi&s;es of Mandragone, gave &s;uch agreeable hopes to Bianca, that with quite another countenance than before, &s;he renewed her conver&s;ation with his lady; who, a little after, taking her by the hand, &s;aid, I have a mind to &s;how you our palace, that you may tell me, if in any thing it re&s;embles your great and noble buildings at Venice; and in the mean time, the old lady, your mother, as &s;he is in years and feeble, may repo&s;e her&s;elf here till our return.</P>
<P><Q>Aye, aye, go (replied &s;he,) for I have not breath enough to mount &s;uch a &s;tair-ca&s;e;</Q>
upon which the young women &s;miling, and arm in arm, ran from room to room, almo&s;t over the whole hou&s;e. This palace, (which &s;tood in the &s;treet called Carne&s;ecchi, near Santa Maria No|vella,) was &s;o lately built that it was not quite fini&s;hed, though very near &s;o; and that with &s;uch good ta&s;te, and &s;o much magnificence, that the
<PB N="457" REF="56">
Venetian lady admired and prai&s;ed every part of it: and now through many anti-chambers, they arrived at la&s;t to a very large one, where there was an ex|treme rich bed, and near it a writing clo&s;et, beau|tifully ornamented, the window of which looked down on a delightful garden. Here the Spaniard having opened a &s;crutore, took out a va&s;t quantity of jewels, which one by one &s;he &s;hewed her gue&s;t, to whom, while &s;he was looking on them with great attention, &s;he &s;poke in this manner,
<Q>I have a great, fancy to &s;hew you &s;ome dre&s;&s;es I have lately made, which they tell me are exactly as the Venetian ladies wear them; but as I mu&s;t fetch the key, I beg you will divert your&s;elf with the&s;e few jewels till I come back.</Q></P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Mandragona gone out of the clo&s;et, but on a &s;udden the grand duke entered it: at who&s;e unexpected pre&s;ence Bianca trembled from head to foot, well imagining the meaning of his coming; but collected in her&s;elf, and alike prudent and virtuous, &s;he immediately threw her|&s;elf at his feet, and in the mo&s;t moving manner &s;aid,
<Q>Since, &s;ir, it has plea&s;ed God that it &s;hould be my unhappy fate to lo&s;e my parents, my fortune, and my country, and to have nothing in this world left me but my honour; permit me humbly to entreat your royal highne&s;s's protection for that only good, which I e&s;teem more than all the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The grand duke hearing her talk in this man|ner, pre&s;ently rai&s;ed her from the ground with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, &s;aying,
<Q>You have no rea&s;on, madam, to fear any thing from me, who only
<PB N="458" REF="57">
come here to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort you, under tho&s;e misfortunes I grieve to &s;ee you &s;uffer; of the truth of which, my actions &s;hall &s;oon convince you; let me then beg you to be &s;atisfied, that you have found a friend in me, both willing and able to make you happy;</Q>
and &s;o &s;aying, he bowed and left her all pale and confu&s;ed, which the Spaniard perceiving at her return, &s;aid,
<Q>Don't wonder, madam, at the abrupt appearance of the grand Duke, for he is plea&s;ed to live in that familiarity with us, that very often, and at all hours he comes in this way, diverting him&s;elf with je&s;ting, and frightening my maids and me; but this time I believe he is well met withal, and I don't doubt but that you have given him an an&s;wer that has put him out of countenance, and perhaps will make him more cautious for the future.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I made him no an&s;wer, &s;aid the Venetian, but what the care of my honour obliged me to, and which I recommended to the mercy and pro|tection of his &s;erene highne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>And you may be certain he will protect it, &s;aid Mandragone:
<Q>But can a lady of your &s;en&s;e and quickne&s;s (added &s;he) not perceive, that fortune in compa&s;&s;ion to your tedious &s;ufferings, has at la&s;t turn'd her face, and will you not &s;eize the golden opportunity? Believe me, madam, the&s;e are accidents that &s;eldom happen; to have &s;o young, &s;o charming, and &s;o great a prince, de|vote his heart with the &s;incere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion to your &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="58">Many were the arguments that the&s;e two ladies u&s;ed to maintain their different opinions; but at the la&s;t tho&s;e of the Spaniard prevailed with Bi|anca Capello to hear the grand duke; and having heard, &s;he &s;oon con&s;ented to accept his love: the charms of his conver&s;ation and per&s;on encrea&s;ing every day her inclination for him, till their pa&s;&s;ion became mutual.</P>
<P>Having traced poor Bianca through all tho&s;e thorny paths that brought her to the flowery precipice into which &s;he fell, we will now turn to Pietro Buonaventuri her hu&s;band, and &s;ee how his new fortune became him, &s;till young and hand&s;ome, and &s;till beloved by his wife; &s;o that upon her account the grand Duke not only made him ma&s;ter of the robes, but gave him a mo&s;t magnificent palace in the &s;treet named Maggio, with &s;uch great appointments, that he enjoyed all the happine&s;s this world could give.</P>
<P>His apartment was on the ground-floor, from whence he could a&s;cend to his wife's, except when the grand Duke was with her, and in that ca&s;e, the door to them was fa&s;tened on the other &s;ide: this happened frequently, Franci&s;co generally di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing his train when he came home in an evening, and only with one or two confidents going pri|vately to &s;up with &s;ignora Bianca, whom he could &s;eldom bring him&s;elf to leave, till an hour before day obliged him to return to his palace; which he did in the &s;ame manner he left it.</P>
<P>Long did this cour&s;e of life, and round of plea&s;ure la&s;t, and longer &s;till it might have done, had not the pro&s;perity and power of Pietro (now become very
<PB N="460" REF="59">
con&s;iderable all over Florence,) filled his mind with &s;o much pride and in&s;olence, that his de&s;ires alone dictated all his actions, without the lea&s;t re|gard to form or decency. Among&s;t the many ladies who&s;e affections he &s;ought to acquire, was a widow called Ca&s;&s;andra Bongianni, de&s;cended from one of the greate&s;t families in the city, who&s;e extraordinary beauty had gained her many admi|rers, to &s;ome of which it had proved very fatal: her relations, to revenge the di&s;honour done their family, having already mi&s;erably de&s;troyed two of them; one of which (a young man of the family of del Caccia) after giving him &s;everal mortal wounds, they dipp'd in pitch, and with a &s;traw hat on his head, and a ba&s;ket full of balls of pack|thread on his arm, &s;et him on a &s;tone near the door of his mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o that all the people, who pa&s;&s;ed, (thinking it was a country man a&s;leep) took no notice of him, till towards evening, &s;ome body going to wake him, di&s;covered the truth, to the great concern of all who knew him, and more par|ticularly his parents; who, after they had buried him, &s;ought in vain for the authors of his death, though every body's conjecture centered on the relations of the lady.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this was well known to Buo|naventuri, it did not in the lea&s;t intimidate him from pur&s;uing his enterprize, which, as he was in&s;inuating, young and beautiful, he &s;oon attained: and not content with his victory, he gloried in the publication of it, je&s;ting upon, and laughing in the very faces of any of her relations whom he met; and being one day particularly impertinent to
<PB N="461" REF="60">
Roberto Ricci, her nephew, he, (unable to endure it,) complained to his aunt, threatning her ex|tremely if &s;he pur&s;ued &s;o vile a practice, which, though &s;he po&s;itively denied to him, &s;he &s;till con|tinued in &s;uch a manner, as made it obvious to all the city: nor did Pietro from this grow more di&s;|creet; but as before he had only laughed at them, he began now to menace and in&s;ult them, which for &s;ome time they feared to re&s;ent, out of re&s;pect to the grand Duke: but at la&s;t their patience being exhau&s;ted, they went all together, and repre&s;ented to his &s;erene highne&s;s, the injuries they &s;uffered from Buonaventuri, begging he would command him to behave in a more rea&s;onable way.</P>
<P>The grand Duke was very much concerned to hear of the ill behaviour of Buonaventuri; and promi&s;ed it &s;hould be remedied. When they were gone he immediately &s;ent for Pietro, and taking him into his clo&s;et, told him the complaints he had received from Ricci, and the re&s;t of Bongianni's relations, adding the&s;e words:
<Q>You &s;ee there|fore, how great is the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;uch things give to families, and as this is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in our dominions, you ought to have &s;ome regard to it; in&s;tead of which you are not content to po&s;&s;e&s;s the aunt, but mu&s;t in&s;ult and ridicule the nephew; and that in the mo&s;t public places, and mo&s;t opprobrious manner: all this forces me to warn you, that as your actions are unju&s;t (perhaps) they may draw on bad con|&s;equences; and &s;hould the&s;e people kill you, 'tis not in my power to re&s;tore you to life; &s;o that if you cannot or will not leave pur&s;uing
<PB N="462" REF="61">
this amour, at lea&s;t do it with more &s;ecrecy and decorum.</Q></P>
<P>The haughty Buonaventuri having heard the gracious admonitions of Franci&s;co, (which being deliver'd with &s;o much rea&s;on and calmne&s;s, he ought to have e&s;teemed them as the greate&s;t of favours) returned this an&s;wer:
<Q>As I a&s;&s;ure your royal highne&s;s, there is not one word of truth in all that the&s;e men have &s;aid, (being neither &s;o extravagant, nor impertinent as they would make me appear,) &s;o I have not the lea&s;t fear of them: but the true cau&s;e of their anger is their envy; they cannot bear to &s;ee me in that &s;tate, to which your highne&s;s's bounty has rai&s;ed me, and there|fore with calumnies endeavour to deprive me of it, envying al&s;o their own blood, who&s;e fortune, like wolves, they would devour; and as they know I have a friend&s;hip for that lady, and am &s;ome protection to her from their cruelty, they are re&s;olved to ruin us both by this mon&s;trous contrivance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know nothing of the&s;e affairs, replied the grand duke, nor do I mean to enter into them; 'tis enough that I have advi&s;ed you as a friend, do as you plea&s;e, what happens after this will be owing to your&s;elf alone;</Q>
and &s;o &s;aying he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Yet little did Buonaventuri profit by the kind remon&s;trances of the great Duke, growing every day more furious and offen&s;ive, committing &s;o many outrages again&s;t all the relations of Ca&s;&s;an|dra, and treating Ricci e&s;pecially, in &s;o de&s;picable a manner, that he was often ready to take a full re|venge,
<PB N="463" REF="62">
being only detained from it by the fear of lo&s;ing his fortune, by the grand Duke's re&s;entment; at la&s;t he re&s;olved to renew his complaints to him, and as he was much in favour with the prince&s;s I&s;abella his &s;i&s;ter, he cho&s;e to do it by her means: to whom he prote&s;ted, he was not able to &s;upport any longer the &s;corn of the world, and abomi|nable impudence of Pietro, to deliver him&s;elf from which, if he could find no other redre&s;s, (he &s;aid) he &s;hould be obliged at la&s;t to abandon the con|&s;ideration of his fortune and every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s having heard him out, went di|rectly to her brother, whom &s;he made &s;en&s;ible of the vile carriage of Buonaventuri, and of the mi&s;|chiefs that might attend it; repre&s;enting the ap|proaching ruin of that whole injur'd family, who were &s;o enraged, as to have no farther re&s;traint, either from their obedience to their &s;overeign, or rea&s;on it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The grand Duke promi&s;ed a &s;peedy and effectual redre&s;s; and con&s;idering with him&s;elf that the only way to it, was to &s;end Pietro from Florence till this hatred &s;hould be abated, by time and ab&s;ence, he determined to employ him in &s;ome of his af|fairs abroad; and as &s;oon as he came to Bianca Capello that night, he told her all that had pa&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion, de&s;iring her to u&s;e all &s;orts of arguments, both per&s;ua&s;ive and threatning, that might induce Buonaventuri to change his pro|ceedings, and for the future to act more wi&s;ely; "But if you can't prevail (added he) I will &s;end him to France, where he &s;hall &s;tay till he is &s;en|&s;ible of his errors."</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="63">This was like a dagger to the heart of poor Bianca, who &s;till loved her hu&s;band to exce&s;s, (though &s;he did not let it appear to the grand duke) and fearing that he would, as he &s;aid, &s;end him away, &s;he re&s;olved to try all the rhetoric of prayers and tears, to turn him from his dangerous cour&s;e, and keep him with her&s;elf. For that purpo&s;e &s;he waited his coming home, which was always late, and when &s;he heard him below in his apartment, &s;he de&s;cended the back &s;tairs, and began in this manner,
<Q>Since my love to you exceeds all that is, or ever was, of pa&s;&s;ionate, and kind, let me by that conjure you, to hear me out with pa|tience; for what I have to &s;ay concerns you in the neare&s;t manner, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to your pre&s;ervation;</Q>
and then in few words &s;he proceeded to tell him all that the grand duke had &s;aid to her, and the re&s;olution he had taken for his &s;ecurity, to &s;end him out of the country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Cautions concerning Imitation.</HEAD>
<P>THE ignorance of children, who&s;e brain hath as yet taken no impre&s;&s;ion, and who have no formed habits, is what occa&s;ions their pliancy and inclination to imitate all they &s;ee. It is therefore a very principal point to &s;et before them none but the be&s;t models; no &s;ort of per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;uf|fered to come near them, but &s;uch as it would be advantageous to copy after. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible, notwith&s;tanding all our precaution, but they mu&s;t &s;ee many irregularities, we &s;hould teach them timely to remark the faulty behaviour of vicious and ir|rational people; &s;uch who&s;e reputation is irretrie|vably lo&s;t: they &s;hould be &s;hewn how de&s;ervedly de&s;picable, how mi&s;erable they are, who abandon them&s;elves to their pa&s;&s;ions, and neglect the cul|tivation of their rea&s;on.</P>
<P>By this means we may, without fear of giving them a turn for mockery, form their ta&s;te, and in&s;pire a &s;en&s;ibility of whatever is truly graceful. Nay, we need not refrain from general cautions, with relation to &s;ome &s;orts of defects, altho' there &s;hould be a danger, by &s;uch proceedings, of giving them an in&s;ight into the weakne&s;&s;es of peo|ple to whom they owe re&s;pect: for be&s;ides that we ought not to hope, nor would it be ju&s;t, to keep
<PB N="466" REF="65">
them ignorant of the true maxims relative to tho&s;e points; &s;o is it the &s;ure&s;t way of keeping them in their duty, to in&s;til the notion that they mu&s;t bear with another's defects; not even judge of them incon&s;iderately; that they often appear greater than they really are; that a number of other good qualities atone for them; that, as perfection is not to be found upon earth, we &s;hould admire tho&s;e who have lea&s;t imperfection: in &s;hort, though this &s;pecies of information ought to be re&s;erved for extremities, neverthele&s;s it is our duty to give the true principles, and to pre&s;erve them from imitating indi&s;criminately whatever evil &s;hall hap|pen to come in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, we &s;hould di&s;courage them from per&s;onating ridiculous people. This turn for co|mic mockery has &s;omething in it low and repug|nant to genteel &s;entiment; be&s;ides which, it is much to be feared le&s;t children &s;hould catch the&s;e manners, becau&s;e the warmth of their imagina|tions, the &s;upplene&s;s of their bodies, and their &s;prightline&s;s together, give them an aptne&s;s in tak|ing all &s;orts of forms for the repre&s;enting every ridiculous object.</P>

PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The natural Hi&s;tory of the Swallow-tail'd Butterfly, and its Ichneumon.</HEAD>
<P>IN a former Number of this work, our fair read|ers may remember we gave them &s;ome account of the &s;everal metamorpho&s;es or alterations from one &s;tate to another, which various cla&s;&s;es of animals undergo. But although we mentioned in general terms the changes of the butterfly kind, yet as we entered into no very particular detail in regard to them, it will not, we hope, be look'd on as any kind of repetition, if we take up a &s;hort portion of their time on that head here.</P>
<P>That beautiful and almo&s;t infinitely varied genus of in&s;ects, which is &s;o well known by the names of butterfly and moth, (the one meaning only a day, the other a night fly,) is to be ranked with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t perfect change, as every one of this kind pa&s;&s;es through the greate&s;t number of
<PB N="468" REF="68">
&s;tates that has yet been di&s;covered among&s;t ani|mals, viz. the egg, worm, chry&s;alis, and fly. But to render the&s;e terms more clear, and at the &s;ame time to relate the general hi&s;tory of this exten&s;ive province in the great kingdom of nature, we &s;hall illu&s;trate it with an example.</P>
<P>The butterfly we have fixed on for this purpo&s;e is one of the mo&s;t beautiful as well as the large&s;t that we know of Engli&s;h growth: it is commonly known by the name of the Swallow Tail, from the figure of its under-wings, which terminate in &s;ome mea&s;ure like the tail of that bird. Some authors indeed have called it the fennel fly, becau&s;e the ca|terpillar which produces it, is fonde&s;t of feeding on fennel, though it is not uncommonly found upon dill, par&s;ley, carrot, and &s;everal other umbelliferous plants. But Linnaeus, who&s;e names are frequently as ab&s;urdly arbitrary, as his &s;y&s;tem is laboriou&s;ly in|genious, has be&s;towed on it the name of Machaon, who was a celebrated Greek phy&s;ician, and &s;on to E&s;culapius.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t &s;tate is, like that of all other in&s;ects, an egg, which is laid by its parent on the plant that is afterwards to become food for the infant worm at the emer&s;ion into life. She, however, &s;eldom lays more than two, never more than three or four on one plant, and tho&s;e &s;ingly and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other. The&s;e eggs are yellow and of a conical form, and are &s;o &s;ixt by the female, with a &s;trong glutinous matter, to the &s;talk of the plant, as to &s;tand all the fierce&s;t at|tacks of the wind and rain, without being forced
<PB N="469" REF="69">
from their hold. One of them, as affixed to a piece of a &s;talk is repre&s;ented at <HI>c,</HI> in the annexed plate.</P>
<P>The&s;e eggs, which are generally laid in June, July, or Augu&s;t, come to perfection in about a month's time; when the young caterpillar breaks forth the &s;ame in every re&s;pect but bulk that it ap|pears when full grown: its body is green, annu|lated, or &s;triped tran&s;ver&s;ely with &s;triae of black, each ringlet &s;tudded with &s;pots of a bright &s;carlet. This caterpillar leads a very &s;olitary life, there &s;el|dom being more than two to be found on one plant. The rea&s;on of this may probably be, that the umbelliferous plants in general, and more parti|cularly the fennel, which, as we have before ob|&s;erved, is the favourite food of this caterpillar, af|ford but a very &s;mall quantity of foliage; and that this worm before its next change, grows to a very con&s;iderable bulk. The parent, in&s;tructed by that mo&s;t infallible of all properties, in&s;tinct, purpo&s;ely depo&s;its her eggs &s;o &s;paringly, le&s;t the future off|&s;pring forming too large a colony to be main|tained by one plant, &s;hould be forced to &s;eek out for fre&s;h quarters, in which ca&s;e, unle&s;s they chanced to meet with another plant of the &s;ame kind with that they quitted, they mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. They are very &s;low in feeding, and in their growth ca&s;t their &s;kins &s;everal times before they change into a Chry&s;alis. In &s;ome the green is more or le&s;s bright, but in general the colours are more vivid in their infant &s;tate than when more fully grown.</P>
<P>This caterpillar has one property peculiar to it|&s;elf, which is, that on the approach of any fly or
<PB N="470" REF="70">
ichneumon, it puts forth from the two red &s;pots on its forehead, a pair of antennae, or horns like tho&s;e of a &s;nail, and then beats about from &s;ide to &s;ide with the fore part of its body, in order to prevent the Ichneumon from emitting or fixing any eggs on its body. Two of the&s;e caterpillars at their full growth, the one at re&s;t, the other with its antennae put forth and defending it&s;elf from the ichneumon, are repre&s;ented at <HI>d</HI> and <HI>e.</HI></P>
<P>His next &s;tate is that of the Chry&s;alis, which, fore&s;eeing for &s;ome little time beforehand, he pre|pares for, by ab&s;taining from food, and di&s;charging his excrements; which done, he fixes him&s;elf by his two hind legs, with a web, to &s;ome part of the &s;talk of the plant, and then &s;pinning a thin &s;ingle thread acro&s;s his body, between the third and fourth joint, remains as it were &s;u&s;pended and im|moveable for about four and twenty hours, when by a continued motion the &s;kin is &s;tripped off, and he becomes converted to the Chry&s;alis, &s;hewn at <HI>f.</HI></P>
<P>This transformation happens in Augu&s;t or Sep|tember, according as the &s;pring may be early or late; and in this &s;ituation he pa&s;&s;es the whole win|ter and en&s;uing &s;pring, coming out about the May or June following, in the form of the large and beautiful butterfly, repre&s;ented at A and B. The wings are of a bright yellow, with borders and bands of a deep black; the under pair &s;till farther decorated with a chain of fine blue &s;pots, and two circles of a full orange. The&s;e flies feed on the dulcet juices of flowers, the moi&s;ture of which they &s;uck in by means of a long probo&s;cis, where|with they are provided. They are frequenly &s;een
<PB N="471" REF="71">
&s;itting with their wings folded, as at <HI>a,</HI> on the ground, near rivers and ponds.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of breeding the&s;e flies them&s;elves, in order to &s;ee their changes, or to pro|cure the butterfly in greater perfection, may find the caterpillars, during the months abovemen|tioned, in places abounding with the umbelliferous plants. When di&s;covered, they mu&s;t be carefully &s;upplied with fre&s;h food: when the Chry&s;alis is ob|tained, it mu&s;t be kept temperate, and not much di&s;turbed: and the box or cage mu&s;t be roomy, in order for the wings to expand them&s;elves, other|wi&s;e they will be liable to be injur'd, when the fly i&s;&s;ues from the &s;hell.</P>
<P>They copulate as &s;oon as they appear in the fly &s;tate, lay their eggs in about a fortnight afterwards, and then &s;oon die.</P>
<P>As in our de&s;cription of the abovementioned butterfly we took notice of the manner in which the caterpillar whereby it is produced, defends it&s;elf from the attacks of the Ichneumon, it may not be improper in this place to explain what we mean by that term; e&s;pecially as it opens an entire new &s;cene in the natural hi&s;tory of the in&s;ect tribe, in which the great parent who provides &s;u&s;tenance for all creatures in different ways, and has in ge|neral contrived it &s;o, that the larger and more pow|erful &s;hall prey on and de&s;troy the &s;maller ones, &s;eems to contradict her&s;elf, by enabling a &s;mall animal to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the very fle&s;h and juices of one much larger than it&s;elf; and that even whil&s;t it continues alive, and apparently in good health.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="72">The Ichneumon then is a cla&s;s of &s;mall flies, whereof there are a very great variety of &s;pecies; the proper nouri&s;hment of the worm of which is, the body of &s;ome other caterpillar. On this ac|count the parent finds means to depo&s;it its eggs on, or rather underneath the &s;kin of &s;uch caterpillar, which hatching in due time, the worm immedi|ately begins to feed on the very entrails of the ca|terpillar; nor ever quits it, even though it fre|quently changes into a Chry&s;alis, as if it were by a metamorpho&s;is to elude its enemy, till the time when his own change is to happen, which he under|goes fir&s;t into an Aurelia, and then into a Fly, emer|ging in the la&s;t form from the very &s;pot where he fir&s;t found re&s;idence in that of an egg.</P>
<P>The fly which is repre&s;ented in the &s;ame plate with the Swallow Tail, &s;itting at <HI>g,</HI> and in its fly|ing po&s;ition at <HI>b,</HI> is one of this &s;ort; preys on the caterpillar of that butterfly, and is produced in the following manner.</P>
<P>The female fly emits an egg, (which is repre|&s;ented in its natural &s;ize and &s;hape <HI>i,</HI>) on the ca|terpillar, either at the time when the caterpillar is a&s;leep, or &s;oon after it has received a new &s;kin. This egg, by means of a glutinous matter, which the parent emits at the &s;ame time with it, is &s;o fixed where it is depo&s;ited, as not to be got off without the utmo&s;t difficulty; and being in le&s;s than &s;even days hatched by the warmth of the caterpillar's body, and the heat of the &s;un, the animal pro|duced from it eats its way thereinto, on that part, whereby it adheres to the body. The empty &s;hell covering the entrance or inci&s;ion made by the newly
<PB N="473" REF="73">
hatched maggot, the wound becomes quickly healed, and the worm feeds on the entrails of the caterpillar till &s;uch time as he comes to his ma|turity, which not being in le&s;s than eighteen or twenty days, it frequently happens that the cater|pillar becomes in the mean while transformed into a Chry&s;alis. The maggot, however, contained either within the caterpillar or chry&s;alis when grown to its full bulk, will eat its way through and fall to the ground; at which time it is in &s;ize and &s;hape as repre&s;ented at <HI>k,</HI> and of a du&s;ky white; but in le&s;s than two hours is formed into a Chry&s;alis, as at <HI>l,</HI> in which &s;tate, if this change happens in &s;ummer, it continues for only about three weeks; but if late in autumn, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, it remains during the whole winter in that &s;tate, and the fly, by eating its way through the &s;hell, comes forth in the &s;pring following.</P>
<P>N. B. All Caterpillars or Chry&s;ales impregnated by Ichneumons, become &s;poiled, and do not pro|duce any butterfly or moth. There are great va|rieties of the Ichneumon fly; but the one we have here de&s;cribed is of the kind called by Linnaeus Larvaxum.</P>

<HEAD>The MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the Inhabitants of AMBOYNA concluded.</HEAD>
<P>THE People who were looked on as the Origines of the&s;e i&s;lands, but which it is pro|bable came thither from other countries, were reckoned by the antient writers, who however knew very little of them, among&s;t the Anthropo|phagi, or devourers of human fle&s;h; and indeed &s;ome recent examples &s;eem to confirm that idea of them. The gro&s;sne&s;s of their manners was per|fectly corre&s;pondent with their &s;implicity and their ignorance, which has however often been favour|able to &s;trangers, &s;till is apparent in the fabu|lous and ab&s;urd relation, which the Amboynians them&s;elves give in regard to their origin. Some of them claim de&s;cent from a crocodile, &s;ome from a &s;erpent, and others from an eel, a tortoi&s;e, or even the old trunk of a tree; on which account they &s;till re&s;pect their ance&s;tors, in the creature from whom they pretend to have &s;prung; and if any one happens to kill one of the&s;e animals, they con&s;ider them&s;elves in duty bound to avenge their deaths.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="75">Ignorance, in all ages the mother of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, has introduced into the wor&s;hip and manner of living of the&s;e i&s;landers, an infinity of cu&s;toms as whim&s;ical as their prejudices are ridi|culous. Demons partake of their principal cares, and are the continual objects of their inquietude. The meeting of a dead body going to the grave, or of a lame, or old man, if it happens to be the fir&s;t live object &s;een in the day; the cry of night birds, or the flight of a crow over their hou&s;es, are with them &s;o many fatal pre&s;ages, who&s;e effects they think them&s;elves enabled to prevent, by in|&s;tantly returning back, and making u&s;e of certain precautions. A few cloves of garlic, &s;ome little bits of pointed wood, and a knife, put into the hand or laid under the pillow of a child in the night time, are by them imagined a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t evil &s;pirits. They never &s;ell the fir&s;t fi&s;h which they catch in new nets, being well per&s;uaded that it is unlucky &s;o to do, but either eat it them|&s;elves or el&s;e pre&s;ent it to &s;ome one. The women who go to market in the morning with certain com|modities, always give the fir&s;t piece for whatever price is offered them; without which they imagine they &s;hould have no bu&s;ine&s;s for the whole day after: al&s;o, whenever they have &s;old any thing, they immediately &s;trike on their ba&s;ket, crying out as loud as they can, "that's well."</P>
<P>It gives the&s;e people no kind of plea&s;ure to com|mend their children; for on the&s;e occa&s;ions they are always apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome de&s;ign to bewitch them, unle&s;s &s;uch commendations are joined with certain expre&s;&s;ions which may di&s;pel all kind of
<PB N="476" REF="76">
diffidence. When a child &s;neezes, they make u&s;e of a &s;ort of imprecation, by way of conjuring the evil &s;pirit which is waiting for its life; and the lea&s;t thing which ails a child they attribute to the power of witchcraft.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas are &s;o deeply rooted among the people of this nation, that it would be in vain to attempt de&s;troying them. Even tho&s;e who have embraced chri&s;tianity are not exempt from them, although they are more circum&s;pect on this head than the others. They will not admit into a &s;ick per&s;on's room any one who has been before where there was a corp&s;e. The women of the country will not eat a double pi&s;ang, nor any other double fruit; nor will a &s;lave pre&s;ent her mi&s;tre&s;s with any &s;uch, for fear that afterwards, when &s;he &s;hall lie in, &s;he &s;hould bring twins into the world, which would be an increa&s;e of dome&s;tic trouble.</P>
<P>When a woman dies either pregnant or in child|bed, the Amboynians believe that &s;he is changed into a daemon, of which they tell &s;tories as ab&s;urd as the precautions which they take on &s;uch occa|&s;ions to prevent this imaginary misfortune. Per|&s;ons attacked by the &s;mall pox, would, according to them, run a very great ri&s;k, if not narrowly and clo&s;ely watched, of being carried away on a branch of &s;agu, by the demon who communicated the di|&s;temper to them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort it would be endle&s;s to enter into a de|tail of all the &s;ingular opinions of the&s;e people, with re&s;pect to an infinity of other things: but the mo&s;t remarkable one, and which &s;hews what an imagination once led to a wrong bia&s;s is capable
<PB N="477" REF="77">
of, is the notion they have formed to them&s;elves concerning their hair, to which they attribute the hidden virtue of &s;upporting a malefactor amid&s;t the mo&s;t cruel tortures, without a po&s;&s;ibility of forcing a confe&s;&s;ion of his crime, unle&s;s by &s;having him, which never fails in&s;tantly to produce that effect.</P>
<P>With &s;o &s;trong an inclination for &s;uper&s;tition there can be no difficulty in conceiving that they &s;hould have a fondne&s;s for necromancy. This &s;cience re|&s;ides in certain particular families who are in high renown among&s;t them; and although the re&s;t hate them mortally, becau&s;e they look on them as ca|pable of doing them a great goal of mi&s;chief, yet they all have recour&s;e to &s;orcery on every occa&s;ion where they think it can procure them any in|formation which may favour their loves or aid any of their de&s;igns. This vice reigns principally among the women, who talk the mo&s;t of it, and who are al&s;o the mo&s;t credulous; but if their magic is more deeply examined it will be found that it mo&s;t fre|quently con&s;i&s;ts only in the fatal art of &s;ubtilly pre|paring poi&s;on; and that every thing al&s;o in it is no more than a texture of &s;kilful impo&s;tures.</P>
<P>Incon&s;tancy, and a love of novelty, are the cha|racteri&s;tics of this people, in whom, therefore, there is no placing any great confidence. The Dutch have frequently experienced the nece&s;&s;ity of de|priving them of the means of following their na|tural bent, which ince&s;&s;antly leads them to form plots again&s;t them, and execute them with as much &s;teadine&s;s as &s;ecrecy whenever they find a favour|able opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="78">Too much &s;everity, however, towards them would be equally dangerous: &s;en&s;ible of injuries, and vexations, vindictive and implacable, it is ever, better to plea&s;e them by fair, than to enrage them by har&s;h treatment. Such moderation therefore is ever &s;trongly recommended in the in&s;tructions which the company &s;ends to its officers; and it were to be wi&s;hed for their own &s;akes that they conformed thereto with more exactne&s;s than they generally do.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION of the I&s;land of CEYLON.</HEAD>
<P>CEYLAN, Ceilon, or Zeilan, is an i&s;land of A&s;ia, in the Indian &s;ea, on this &s;ide of the Ganges, near the Cape of Comori, upon the &s;treight of Manar or Quiloa. It lies in about &s;ix degrees of &s;outh latitude, and near 200 of longitude; and is one of the mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e &s;eas: its length being, according to the accounts of the Hollanders, who have mea&s;ured it the mo&s;t exactly, about fifty-five leagues, its greate&s;t breadth about thirty, and its whole circumference one hundred and ninety &s;even. Its figure is nearly that of a pear, or rather of a gammon of bacon; for which rea&s;on the Dutch have given the fort Cays, near Jaffanapatam, the name of Hammenbiel, or the Knuckle of the Gammon, a name which is perfectly expre&s;&s;ive of the form of the i&s;land in that place.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land lies between the Hollanders and the &s;overeign of the country, which is called king of Candi, or Candi-Uda. The fir&s;t European &s;ettlements that were made on it were by the Portugue&s;e, who, not contented with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of part of the coa&s;t, carried their incur|&s;ions as far as to the capital, which they burned more than once, without &s;paring even the palaces or temples; in &s;hort, they rendered them&s;elves &s;o formidable, that they obliged the king to pay them an annual tribute of three elephants, and to purcha&s;e peace on many other &s;ervile conditions. At length, however, that prince had recour&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Dutch of Batavia, who joining
<PB N="480" REF="80">
their forces to his, entirely beat the Portugue&s;e, and drove them out of all their fortified places, af|ter their having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them for near a hundred and fifty years. The monarch, however, was little advantaged by this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was only in|tended to procure a like e&s;tabli&s;hment for them|&s;elves: for the Dutch, on the cOnclu&s;ion of the war, and more e&s;pecially after making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Colombo, in 1655, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to give up a conque&s;t which they thus &s;aw them&s;elves in the ea&s;y po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of: ever &s;ince which time they have applied their whole care and diligence to for|tify them&s;elves on the coa&s;t. Their principal e&s;ta|bli&s;hments are at Jafnapatam, and the i&s;land of Manaar on the north; Trinquemali, and Batticalon, on the ea&s;t; the town of Point de Galla, on the &s;outh; and Colombo on the we&s;t. To &s;ay no|thing of Negombo, and Calpentin, which are two other towns belonging to them, with &s;everal forts at the mouth of the rivers and the openings of moun|tains, for the defence of pa&s;&s;es; &s;o that the Dutch may properly be con&s;idered as ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of much the greate&s;t part of the coa&s;ts of this very exten&s;ive i&s;land.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ONE of your corre&s;pondents having given you a mo&s;t entertaining account of the fair and unfortunate Bianca Ca|pello, give me leave to offer at your &s;hrine, &s;ome curious anecdotes of an Italian hero, known by the name of Ca&s;truccio Ca&s;tracani. I &s;hall draw my materials from Machiavel. They begin, I believe, with a mixture of truth and romance: Ma|chiavel never keeping &s;trictly in the road of truth, when by going a little on one &s;ide of it, he could embelli&s;h the hi&s;tory of his country. In the main, the facts are true.</P>
<P>In the city of Lucca, capital of the little republic of that name, Dianora Ca&s;tracani, an unmarried
<PB N="482" REF="82">
&s;i&s;ter of Antonio Ca&s;tracani, one of the prebends of the cathedral of Lucca, going one morning into her garden, to gather herbs, found &s;ecreted among &s;ome cabbages an infant boy, who at her approach held out its helple&s;s little hands, and cried, as wanting a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Dianora was moved at the &s;ight; &s;he took up the child, and carried him into her brother's hou&s;e. The prebend, no le&s;s humane than his &s;i&s;ter, approved of what &s;he had done, and re&s;olving to pre&s;erve, nouri&s;h, and adopt this foundling, immediately gave the child bapti&s;m, by the name of Ca&s;truccio.</P>
<P>Antonio and Dianora performed their different parts with equal care and attention, in the culture of this young &s;apling, which Antonio intended to plant, in a proper &s;ea&s;on, under the &s;hade of the church. Fate, and Ca&s;truccio's own inclinations, intended him for a more open &s;ituation. At the age of fourteen, arms were his exerci&s;e, and books on military &s;ubjects his &s;tudy. The boy had di&s;|covered &s;o many feats of courage among his play-fellows, and &s;uch an unwearied attention to all the exerci&s;es in which he &s;aw the &s;oldiers employed, that he had attracted the particular ob&s;ervation of Franci&s;co Guinigi, a gentleman of great e&s;teem and authority; head of that party di&s;tingui&s;hed in Lucca, by the title of the Ghibellins. Guinigi &s;ent for the boy, and, after having exactly learnt his &s;tory, and education, very generou&s;ly offered to place him, without any expence to him&s;elf or friends, in the army. Ca&s;truccio, with great eager|ne&s;s, cho&s;e to mount a hor&s;e, rather than a&s;cend a pulpit: he quitted the good prie&s;t Antonio Ca&s;|tracani,
<PB N="483" REF="83">
with all the decency of gratitude, and en|li&s;ted into the Ghibellian troops, with all the rap|tures of an Achilles. His per&s;on, his manners, and particularly his mode&s;ty, &s;oon became extreme|ly attractive. He was not only agreeable to the family of Guinigi, but to the whole people of Lucca. He had &s;carce been three years in the army, when, in con&s;equence of a treaty between the Lucche&s;e and the Pavians, the Guelfs of Pavia applied to the Ghibellins of Lucca for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was granted by the latter, notwith&s;tanding former antipathies, the Guelfs and Ghibellines having been long at variance. Franci&s;co Guinigi, was appointed with the number of auxiliary troops in favour of the Pavians. Among the&s;e &s;quadrons marched Ca&s;truccio, then only eighteen years old: he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;o remarkable a manner, and reflected &s;uch glory and &s;ucce&s;s upon his coun|trymen, that at his return to Lucca, he was re|ceived with the mo&s;t unanimous applau&s;e, and re|warded with honours &s;eldom or ever be&s;towed up|on &s;o young an officer. He was rai&s;ed in the army and in the &s;tate, to a rank equal with Uguccione della Fuggivola: even his per&s;onal lo&s;&s;es became to him fre&s;h acqui&s;itions of power; his great patron and benefactor, Franci&s;co Guinigi died, and left Ca&s;truccio tutor and &s;ole director of the education and fortune of his only &s;on Pagolo Guinigi. A tru&s;t of &s;uch importance &s;till exalted the character of Ca&s;truccio, e&s;pecially as his intentions of di&s;|charging it with honour and fidelity appeared in every &s;tep of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="84">After the death of Franci&s;co Guinigi, who&s;e au|thority had been inconte&s;tably great, Georgio Opizi attempted to gra&s;p the &s;ame &s;ame degree of power which Franci&s;co had enjoyed in Lucca: he was the head of a numerous family, all of whom were Guelfs. Uguccione, jealous of the Opizi, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially of Georgio, was advi&s;ed by Ca&s;|truccio, to de&s;troy the whole race at once. The manner of putting his &s;cheme into execution was performed with equal &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch. Ca&s;|truccio remained at Lucca, while Uguccione went to his government at Pi&s;a; but &s;oon returned in the night time un&s;u&s;pected to the gates of Lucca, at the head of an army of Ghibellins, whom he had brought from Pi&s;a.</P>
<P>Ca&s;truccio was ready at the time appointed to open the gates, and in the &s;laughter of a few hours, the entire race of the Opizi, and great numbers of the chief Guelfs, were put to the &s;word. Not one of the Opizi &s;urvived; but, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity of the night, about an hundred of the Guelf families e&s;caped, &s;ome of whom took re|fuge in Florence, others in Pi&s;toia.</P>
<P>To this ma&s;&s;acre, for it will bear no &s;ofter a de|nomination, &s;ucceeded La Battaglia de Monticatini, the battle fought upon the banks of the Nievole. Uguccione was hindered by illne&s;s from being per&s;onally pre&s;ent in the battle: one of his &s;ons was killed, Ca&s;truccio was wounded, and three hundred of the Lucche&s;e army were left dead upon the field.</P>
<P>Uguccione, naturally jealous, was now grown as unea&s;y at the e&s;tabli&s;hed power of Ca&s;truccio
<PB N="485" REF="85">
Ca&s;tracani as he had been at the a&s;piring power of Georgio Opizi. He &s;aw the repeated victories of &s;o young a general with envy. He acquie&s;ced to councils, and pur&s;ued mea&s;ures, which he wi&s;hed rather to have given, than to have heard. He had been taught by Ca&s;truccio him&s;elf, that death was the only &s;ure antidote again&s;t a rival. <HI>Morta la Serpe, &s;pento it veleno.</HI>
<Q>The viper killed, the poi&s;on evaporates.</Q>
In pur&s;uance of this maxim, he &s;ent a letter to his &s;on, Neri Uguccione, to invite Ca&s;truccio to &s;upper, and there, in defiance of all laws of ho&s;pitality and honour, to take an opportunity to murder him. Ca&s;truccio was in|vited; accepted the invitation, and in the mid&s;t of the fe&s;tivity was manacled and confined as a pri|&s;oner, but not murdered. Neri Uguccione rightly judged that the forfeiture of his own life would be inherent to the de&s;truction of &s;o popular a man as Ca&s;truccio. The father, le&s;s con&s;iderate and more envious, was re&s;olved to perfect the bloody work, which his &s;on was unwilling to perform. He came to Lucca, with a con&s;iderable number of &s;oldiers for that purpo&s;e. At his arrival, the whole people of Lucca ro&s;e in arms, delivered Ca&s;truccio from his impri&s;onment, and &s;oon drove Uguccione out of Tu&s;cany: he took refuge in Lombardy, where &s;ome years afterwards he died in little e&s;teem, and extremely poor.</P>
<P>Uguccione being removed, the whole field of honorary dignities lay open to Ca&s;truccio: he was &s;olemnly elected prince of Lucca, and lord of Pi&s;a: he was &s;carce in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e titles, when Frederic of Au&s;tria came into Italy, where he was
<PB N="486" REF="86">
received as emperor; and in a per&s;onal interview with Ca&s;truccio, appointed him his lieutenant in Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>Ca&s;truccio, equally courted by Tu&s;cans, Lombar|dians, and Guibellins, entertained hopes within his own brea&s;t, of becoming entire ma&s;ter of the whole kingdom of Tu&s;cany. In pur&s;uance of &s;uch in|tentions, he re&s;olved to &s;eize upon Florence; but while he was taking proper mea&s;ures to fulfil the&s;e revolutions, he was called back to Lucca, on account of a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, concerted by the family of Poggio.</P>
<P>The &s;everal branches of the hou&s;e of Poggio thought their merits ill rewarded by Ca&s;truccio, to who&s;e &s;overeignty they had zealou&s;ly contributed. Catching mutually fire from each other's indig|nation, they took advantage of their prince's ab|&s;ence, killed his lieutenant, and were warmly in|citing the whole &s;tate of Lucca to rebel, when Stefano Poggio, an old man of great worth and weight in his family, who had kept him&s;elf free even from all thoughts of a con&s;piracy, &s;topped any farther mi&s;chief, and waited upon Ca&s;truccio, to a&s;k his pardon for what had already pa&s;t. Ca&s;|truccio received him without any outward &s;hew of re&s;entment; and having placed &s;oldiers upon whom he might depend, in every corner of the city, he appointed a day when Stefano Poggio at the head of his relations &s;hould come to receive an act of grace. The harmle&s;s un&s;u&s;picious old man, being deceived him&s;elf, deceived all his relations, and attended with his whole family at the day and hour appointed. They were admitted to Ca&s;|truccio:
<PB N="487" REF="87">
they were &s;ent by his immediate orders to pri&s;on; and &s;oon afterwards, without any re&s;pect to age, or regard to honour, they were every one of them put to death.</P>
<P>More effectually to &s;ecure him&s;elf in a govern|ment, which he found capable of entertaining plots again&s;t him, Ca&s;truccio, under various pretences, de&s;troyed either the life or fortune of every indi|vidual Lucche&s;e, whom he &s;u&s;pected as his per&s;onal enemy; and having pulled down many of their ca&s;tles, he turned the materials to his own &s;ervice, and built a fortre&s;s at Lucca in a &s;ituation to com|mand and terrify the inhabitants. As a farther &s;e|curity of his dominions, he made a league of friend&s;hip with the Florentines for two years, and then turned his thoughts towards Pi&s;toia, in which city he knew the old party-divi&s;ions, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Bianci and Neri, were not totally extingui&s;hed. With great accutene&s;s he fore&s;aw the con&s;equences that mu&s;t follow from tho&s;e di|vi&s;ions, and found him&s;elf courted by both parties, &s;eparately and &s;ecretly from each other. He gave them both a&s;&s;urances of his protection. Ba&s;tianodi Po&s;&s;ente was at the head of the Bianchi, Jacopo da Gia at the head of the Neri. To Jacopo he pro|mi&s;ed troops under his own conduct; to Ba&s;tiano he promi&s;ed troops under the conduct of Pagolo Guinigi, whom he treated and loved as his &s;on. The troops of both commanders marched different ways, and came into the town at different gates; but at the &s;ame time the Pi&s;toians of each party received them as friends. Ca&s;truccio &s;oon gave
<PB N="488" REF="88">
the &s;ignal, and while Guinigi cut in pieces the Bianchi, Ca&s;truccio him&s;elf &s;laughtered the Neri. Then, as conquerors, they &s;eized the palace, put them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ignory, quieted the populace, and made Pi&s;toia their own.</P>
<P>Ca&s;truccio, by his continued victories, no mat|ter how obtained, was become the idol of wor&s;hip to all the &s;tates of Italy: he was entreated to come to Rome to pacify the people, who were ready to mutiny for want of provi&s;ions. Pope John the XXII. was, by the twenty &s;eventh &s;chi&s;m in the church, at that time driven to Avignon: and the emperor Lewis V. was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Rome. Ca&s;truccio ha&s;tened in per&s;on to the relief of the Romans, and &s;ent thither great quantities of corn from Pi&s;a: he calmed the mu|tiny, made him&s;elf acceptable to the emperor and the nobility, and was created a &s;enator of Rome.</P>
<P>The Florentines fore&s;eeing their danger, in the capture of a town &s;o clo&s;e to their territories as Pi&s;toia, &s;eized it to them&s;elves, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;tratagems of &s;everal of the inhabitants, who were glad to be delivered from the pre&s;ent yoke of their &s;ervitude; and whom the Florentines, by the power of money and promi&s;es, had &s;educed to their own de&s;ires. Such an action was &s;carce ju&s;tifiable, if the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting truce had been ratified to any other man le&s;s faithle&s;s, ambitious, or &s;an|guinary than Ca&s;truccio: but he was to be looked upon as a wolf, and all the &s;tates of Italy as lambs de&s;tined to his voracity, unle&s;s they could find a &s;hepherd for their own &s;ecurity. He ha&s;tened
<PB N="489" REF="89">
back from amid&s;t his honours at Rome, and made preparations for a Florentine war. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of that war were various: &s;ometimes the acqui|&s;itions were on one &s;ide, &s;ometimes on the other; till in the year 1328, one great battle gave Ca&s;|truccio a &s;ignal, but, in its con&s;equence, a dear bought victory. As &s;oon as the conque&s;t was en|tirely compleated, by the lo&s;s of twenty thou&s;and Florentines, and the flight of the re&s;t, their whole army having con&s;i&s;ted of thirty thou&s;and foot and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, Ca&s;truccio placed him&s;elf in the gate|way of the town of Fu&s;echio, the head-quarters of his own re&s;idence, to review his troops at their re|turn, and to take an opportunity of thanking the &s;everal &s;oldiers and officers of his army, as they pa&s;&s;ed by him into the town. He was much heated and fatigued by the long and laborious com|bat; and whil&s;t he &s;taid in the pa&s;&s;age of the gate, hot, and expo&s;ed to a very &s;harp nipping wind, he caught cold, and the next night a fever con|fined him to his bed. At fir&s;t the &s;ymptoms were not dangerous, but the di&s;temper increa&s;ing by degrees, quickly &s;pread throughout his body, and beyond the limits of medicinal power. As &s;oon as he found him&s;elf without the lea&s;t hopes of re|covery, he called Pagolo Guinigi to his bed &s;ide, and embracing him with the compo&s;ure of a hero, and the affection of a father, made a very moving &s;peech, and took a la&s;t melancholy fare|well of his pupil, who had been the con&s;tant ob|ject of his care. Ca&s;truccio died September 3, 1328. No comments are requi&s;ite to illu&s;trate
<PB N="490" REF="90">
the life of &s;uch a man: his actions are a con|tinual comment upon them&s;elves: they repre&s;ent him an active, bloody, remor&s;ele&s;s &s;oldier; not un&s;u&s;ceptible to the calls of gratitude and friend|&s;hip, but vindictive to a degree that makes hu|man nature almo&s;t tremble at his name.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they arrived at Mrs. Law&s;on's, Sophia, who little expected &s;uch a vi&s;it, had wandered, as u&s;ual, in the wood, accompanied with Dolly: Mrs. Law&s;on immediately &s;ent Fanny in &s;earch of her; and Harriot, expre&s;&s;ing an im|patience to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter, went along with her.</P>
<P>They found Sophia &s;itting under an oak, with Mrs. Gibbons on one &s;ide of her, and Dolly on the other; for the old gentlewoman was prevailed upon by Sophia to endure the company of the in|nocent girl, who had never offended her; and Dolly, in&s;tructed by her lovely friend, made good u&s;e of the&s;e opportunities to in&s;inuate her&s;elf into her favour.</P>
<P>William leaned on a branch clo&s;e by Sophia, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e, while his eyes often &s;tole tender glances at his beloved Dolly. Harriot, when &s;he approached, cried out affectedly,
<Q>Upon my word, &s;i&s;ter, you have a brilliant a&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="492" REF="92">
here; I did not expect to find you in &s;uch good company.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter, ran ha&s;tily to meet her, and embracing her kindly, enquired with a &s;weet anxiety for her mother, and whether &s;he al&s;o had been &s;o good to vi&s;it her. Harriot &s;carce an&s;wered her que&s;tion; her attention was all fixed upon William: &s;o hand&s;ome a youth &s;eemed worthy to feel the influence of her charms; and all the artillery of her eyes was in&s;tantly levelled again&s;t him. Having returned his re&s;pectful bow with an affected courte&s;y, and the fa&s;hionable to&s;s of the head, &s;he deigned to take &s;ome little notice of Mrs. Gibbons, and honoured Dolly with a care|le&s;s glance, who&s;e amiable figure, however, at|tracted a &s;econd look; and after examining her with an inqui&s;itive eye, &s;he turned away with a little expre&s;&s;ion of &s;corn in her countenance, and again attacked William, practi&s;ing a thou&s;and airs to &s;trike him; all which he beheld with the utmo&s;t indifference.</P>
<P>Sophia, being impatient to &s;ee her mother, took leave of Mrs. Gibbons; but Harriot, who had a new conque&s;t in view, was unwilling to go &s;o &s;oon, profe&s;&s;ing her&s;elf inchanted with the place, and declaring &s;he would turn &s;hepherde&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia told her, &s;miling, that &s;he was &s;ure that that &s;ort of life would not plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><Q>Oh! how can you think &s;o, cried Harriot, is not the dre&s;s exce&s;&s;ively becoming? then love in the&s;e woods is &s;o tender and &s;incere! I will engage there is not a nymph in this hamlet who&s;e frown would not drive her lover to de&s;|pair:
<PB N="493" REF="93">
pair: own the truth now, &s;aid &s;he, turning with a lively air to William, are you not violently in love?</Q></P>
<P>The youth bowed, blu&s;hed, and &s;ighed; and not daring to look at his mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;uffered his eyes, full as they were of tender expre&s;&s;ion, to direct their glances towards Sophia.
<Q>I am proud to own, madam, &s;aid he to Harriot, that I have a heart capable of the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>"And mighty con&s;tant too! no doubt," in|terupted Harriot, with a malignant &s;neer; for &s;he had ob&s;erved the &s;igh and the look, and was ready to bur&s;t with vexation and di&s;appointment, to find her conque&s;t ob&s;tructed already by her &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed; and being now as impatient, as &s;he was before unwilling to be gone,
<Q>Come, Sophy, &s;aid &s;he, taking her under the arm, my mamma will take it ill that you make no more ha&s;te to &s;ee her, for we &s;hall return to town imme|diately.</Q></P>
<P>"Sure you will &s;tay one night," &s;aid Sophia.</P>
<P>"Oh not for the world!" exclaimed Harriot af|fectedly;
<Q>How can you imagine I would &s;tay &s;o long in an odious village, to be ru&s;ticated into aukwardne&s;s, pur&s;ued &s;he, with a &s;piteful laugh, and a&s;hamed to &s;hew my face in any a&s;&s;emby in town afterwards.</Q>
Saying this, &s;he courte&s;ied di&s;dainfully to Mrs. Gibbons and her nephew, and tripped away, pulling her &s;i&s;ter away with her.</P>
<P>Dolly joined the two ladies, but walked by the &s;ide of Sophia, not aiming at any familiarity with the in&s;olent and affected Harriot; and as they pur|&s;ued their way home, &s;he had the mortification to
<PB N="494" REF="94">
hear her lover ridiculed and de&s;pi&s;ed by the di&s;ap|pointed coquet, who &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he mortified her &s;i&s;ter by the contempt &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for a man who had &s;o little ta&s;te as to like her.</P>
<P>Sophia, as well in compa&s;&s;ion to poor Dolly, who &s;uffered greatly upon this occa&s;ion, as in ju&s;tice to the amiable youth, defended him warmly, which drew &s;ome coar&s;e raillery upon her from Harriot.</P>
<P>When they came near to Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, the &s;ight of Sir Charles's chariot threw her into a fit of trembling; Harriot perceived it, and willing to undeceive her, if &s;he hoped to find the young baronet there,
<Q>I am charged with Sir Charles's compliments, to you, &s;aid &s;he, he in&s;i&s;ted upon our u&s;ing his chariot for this little excur&s;ion; my mamma and I would fain have per&s;uaded him to accompany us, but he pleaded an en|gagement, and would not come.</Q></P>
<P>Dolly now looked with great concern upon her fair friend, who &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh, a&s;ked if Sir Charles was quite recovered.</P>
<P><Q>I do not know that he has been ill, replied Harriot. Indeed when he came from Bath, the fatigue he had endured with his &s;ick uncle, whom he had &s;at up with &s;everal nights before he died, made him look a little pale and thin; but he is now extremely well, and more gay than ever: and it is well he is &s;o, pur&s;ued &s;he, for we have &s;o much of his company, that if he was not entertaining, we &s;hould find him very trouble&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="95">All this was daggers to the heart of poor So|phia: tho&s;e plea&s;ing ideas which &s;he had indulged upon reading her mother's letter, that repre&s;ented Sir Charles as having &s;uffered in his health, from his endeavours to vanqui&s;h his pa&s;&s;ion for her, all vani&s;hed, and left in their room a &s;ad conviction that &s;he was become wholly indifferent to him.</P>
<P>She might indeed, knowing her &s;i&s;ter's malice, have attributed what &s;he &s;aid to artifice; but her manner of accounting for the alteration in Sir Charles's looks, which her fond fancy had dwelt upon &s;o much, was &s;o natural and &s;o full of pro|bability, that &s;he could &s;u&s;pect no artifice there.</P>
<P>Every thing Harriot &s;aid was confirmed by facts which left no room for doubt: his a&s;&s;iduity to Harriot, his neglect of her, appeared but too plain. Did he not lend his chariot for a vi&s;it in which he would not &s;hare? did he not &s;end his compliments in a manner that &s;hewed his heart was &s;o much at ea&s;e, that he felt not even any re&s;entment for her leaving him? could there be &s;tronger proofs of indifference than the&s;e?</P>
<P>Such were her thoughts, and her heart was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed by this &s;udden and unexpected &s;hock, that it was with difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her tears. Dolly, who looked at her with tender anxiety, and &s;aw her colour come and go, and her charming eyes bent on the ground, as if &s;he feared to look up, le&s;t they &s;hould betray her angui&s;h, ca&s;t many an angry glance at her envious &s;i&s;ter, and wi&s;hed her a thou&s;and miles off.</P>
<P>Sophia having a little recovered her&s;elf, ha&s;tened towards her mother, who with a face of ignorant
<PB N="496" REF="96">
wonder was following Mrs. Law&s;on about her little farm, a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions, without heeding the an&s;wers &s;he received. Sophia approaching, paid her duty to her with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, which Mrs. Darnley returned with &s;lightly ki&s;&s;ing her cheek, telling her that &s;he thought her complexion was greatly improved, and appealed to Harriot for the truth of her ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Harriot an&s;wered,
<Q>That indeed &s;he could not flatter her &s;i&s;ter &s;o much, as to &s;ay &s;he thought &s;o; for if there was any alteration, it was rather for the wor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, without attending to this difference of opinion, with regard to her complexion, was only &s;ollicitous to know if her mother had been well; and while &s;he was making &s;ome tender enquiries concerning her health, Mrs. Darnley, who never con&s;ulted either time or place, &s;uddenly interupted her to draw her a&s;ide from the company, and a&s;ked her abruptly,
<Q>Whether &s;he was not &s;urpri&s;ed at Sir Charles's indifference?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, &s;till &s;marting with the pangs her &s;i&s;ter's di&s;cour&s;e had given her, replied, in a tone of re|&s;entment,
<Q>That nothing now could &s;urpri&s;e her with regard to Sir Charles.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why, to &s;ay the truth, Sophia, replied Mrs. Darnley, I believe he has quite forgot you; but there was a time when you might have been happy.&mdash;oh girl, girl, pur&s;ued &s;he, kindling with anger as &s;he &s;poke, you were always ob&s;tinate and conceited; what a fooli&s;h part have you played with all your wit! but I am to blame to trouble my&s;elf about you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="97">Sophia now ea&s;ed her loaded heart by a &s;hower of tears.
<Q>It is to little purpo&s;e now, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, to repent of your imprudent behaviour; you were too wi&s;e to take a parent's advice, when it might have been u&s;eful: when a man of rank and fortune makes his addre&s;&s;es to a woman who is inferior to him in both, he ex|pects a thou&s;and little complacencies and atten|tions from her, which, without wounding her honour, may convince him that it is not to his riches &s;he &s;acrifices her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, Madam, cried Sophia, that is a &s;nare which has been fatal to many young women in my circum&s;tances. Who &s;ees not the advantages this gives a man who&s;e aim is to &s;educe? I am per&s;uaded the&s;e pernicious maxims are not yours, but his, for who&s;e ungenerous purpo&s;e they are &s;o well calculated.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia gue&s;&s;ed truly; the young baronet had often had di&s;cour&s;es of this &s;ort with Mrs. Darn|ley, who neverthele&s;s took it ill that her daugh|ter &s;hould offer her &s;uch an affront as to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did not under&s;tand maxims as well as Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than that we are never made &s;o ridiculous by the qualities we have, as by tho&s;e we affect to have. Mrs. Darnley, with all her ignorance, a&s;pired to be thought witty: &s;he therefore vindicated her claim to what Sophia had called maxims; no matter whether they were per|nicious or not. The word maxim &s;ounded learnedly in her ears: &s;he told her daughter, with great a&s;|perity, that &s;he was &s;o conceited and vain of her
<PB N="498" REF="98">
own wit, that &s;he would allow no one el&s;e to have any. Sophia found it difficult enough to appea&s;e her, but &s;he &s;ucceeded at length, and they joined the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>Mrs. Law&s;on ea&s;ily prevailed upon her gue&s;ts to &s;tay that night and the following day, which, be|ing Sunday, Harriot could not re&s;i&s;t the temp|tation of di&s;playing her charms and her fine cloaths in a country church, which was &s;o new a triumph, that the thoughts of it kept her waking almo&s;t the whole night.</P>
<P>The ridiculous airs &s;he a&s;&s;umed to draw the ad|miration of the &s;imple villagers, who never &s;aw any thing &s;o fine and &s;o gay before, and who &s;tared at her with &s;tupid &s;urpri&s;e, made Sophia often blu&s;h for her: but her affected glances were chiefly di|rected to the beautiful youth, who&s;e in&s;en&s;ibility had &s;o greatly mortified her pride: &s;he &s;aw his eyes con|&s;tantly turned towards the pew where &s;he &s;at; but &s;he &s;aw plainly that it was not her charms that drew them thither. She had no &s;u&s;picion that Dolly was the object of his affection, and, &s;en&s;ible to her great grief, of her &s;i&s;ter's power to charm, &s;he no longer doubted that this envied conque&s;t was hers.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, &s;he appeared &s;o much out of humour, and &s;o impatient to return to town, that Mrs. Darnley, over whom her power was ab|&s;olute, complied with her importunity, and &s;et out with her for London, as &s;oon as they returned from church; notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the good curate and his wife to detain them to dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="99">Sophia was now left alone to her own melancholy reflections; this vi&s;it from her mother and &s;i&s;ter had produced a &s;ad rever&s;e in her &s;ituation: hi|therto hope had not quite for&s;aken her; the idea of being &s;till beloved by Sir Charles le&s;&s;ened all her griefs, and &s;upported her amid&s;t the doubt and anxiety which his my&s;terious conduct had involved her in: his indifference, &s;o apparent in her &s;i&s;ter's account of him, gave her pangs unfelt before: and never till now did &s;he think her&s;elf un|happy; for, unperceived by her&s;elf, &s;he had en|couraged a &s;ecret hope that the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had in&s;pired him with would not be ea&s;ily &s;ubdued; and that perhaps all which &s;he had thought ex|ceptionable in his conduct proceeded not from a &s;ettled de&s;ign to the prejudice of her honour, but from that irre&s;olution and &s;lowne&s;s with which a man, too &s;en&s;ible of his &s;uperiority in birth and fortune, proceeds in an affair of marriage, where he has no ob&s;tacles to fear, and where every thing depends upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>She now perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of bani&s;hing Sir Charles from her heart; but at the &s;ame time, &s;he perceived all the difficulty of the ta&s;k. Though a&s;hamed of her tears, &s;he wept, and pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed again&s;t her own weakne&s;s, which had kept her in a delu&s;ion &s;o fatal to her peace. She continued the whole day in her chamber, wholly ab&s;orb'd in melancholy thoughts.</P>
<P>Dolly, who knew enough of her &s;ituation to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of this new affliction, was grieved to find her&s;elf excluded as well as the re&s;t of the family; and although &s;he ardently wi&s;hed to con|&s;ole
<PB N="500" REF="100">
her, yet &s;he dur&s;t not intrude uncalled upon her retirement. While &s;he waited impatiently for her appearance, a vi&s;itor arrived, who &s;he knew would be welcome to her charming friend. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived him, &s;he flew with eager ha&s;te to inform Sophia, and, tapping at her door, told her in a joyful voice, that Mr. Herbert was ju&s;t alighted.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;urpri&s;ed at the news, in&s;tantly opened her chamber-door, and &s;miling tenderly upon the charming girl, to whom &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf for her long ab&s;ence, ha&s;tened to receive the good old man, who, after &s;ome affectionate enquiries concerning her health, rallied her upon the melan|choly that appeared in her countenance.</P>
<P>Sophia blu&s;hed and fixed her eyes on the ground, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at his talking to her in that manner; and when with a ba&s;hful air, &s;he looked up again, and &s;aw a more than u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s in his eyes, her confu&s;ion encrea&s;ed, and for a few moments &s;he could not help feeling &s;ome re|&s;entment again&s;t her benefactor, for thus diverting him&s;elf with her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who&s;e thoughts were wholly em|ployed on the plea&s;ing news he brought, did not perceive how much his behaviour embarra&s;&s;ed her: to prevent his renewing a &s;ubject &s;o di&s;agreeable, &s;he talked of the vi&s;it her mother and &s;i&s;ter had made her.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert a&s;ked her,
<Q>If they had men|tioned Sir Charles, and what &s;he thought of him now?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="501" REF="101">
<Q>I think of him as I ought to do, replied So|phia, with &s;ome warmth, I de&s;pi&s;e him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be not too ra&s;h, my dear child, &s;aid Mr. Her|bert; if your &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e malice I well know, has &s;ugge&s;ted any thing to Sir Charles's di&s;ad|vantage, be a&s;&s;ured &s;he deceives you; for I am convinced he not only loves you, but loves you with honour.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, who from the fir&s;t words Mr. Herbert uttered, had been in great agitation, as expecting &s;omething extraordinary, was &s;o overwhelmed with &s;urpri&s;e at what &s;he heard, that her &s;peech and colour for&s;aking her, &s;he remained pale, &s;ilent, and motionle&s;s in her chair.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, perceiving how powerfully this news operated on her &s;pirits, began to be apprehen|&s;ive of the con&s;equences, and was ri&s;ing ha&s;tily to give her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when Sophia, rouzed to recollection by this motion of her venerable friend, and a&s;hamed of the extreme &s;en&s;ibility &s;he had di&s;|covered, apologi&s;ed for it with a charming mode&s;ty, that greatly affected the good old man, who, if he had known in what melancholy thoughts &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the day, would have told her with more caution, a circum&s;tance that rai&s;ed her at once from de&s;pair to hope, and produced &s;o great a change in her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As we are never &s;o ready to fear a di&s;appoint|ment as when we are neare&s;t the completion of our wi&s;hes, Sophia, with a &s;weet apprehen&s;ive|ne&s;s, which yet &s;he laboured to conceal, hinted her doubts of the baronet's &s;incerity; Mr. Herbert an&s;wering explicitly to the&s;e half expre&s;&s;ed doubts,
<PB N="502" REF="102">
told her, that he was fully per&s;uaded Sir Charles would act like a man of honour. "I will give you an exact account, &s;aid he to her, of what has pa&s;&s;ed between us, from which you may judge your&s;elf of his conduct:" he then took a letter out of his pocket, and de&s;ired her to read it.</P>
<P>Sophia, trembling a little at the &s;ight of Sir Charles's hand writing, took the billet, and found it contained a me&s;&s;age from him to Mr. Herbert, reque&s;ting in very earne&s;t terms, the favour of an interview, and an offer to wait upon him at any hour he &s;hould appoint.</P>
<P><Q>You may be &s;ure, &s;aid Mr. Herbert, (receiving back the billet which Sophia gave him without &s;peaking a word) that I did not &s;uffer Sir Charles to come to me; hearing from the me&s;&s;enger that his ma&s;ter was at home waiting for my an&s;wer, I attended him immediately. I perceived a little embarra&s;&s;ment in his countenance upon my fir&s;t entrance, but that &s;oon wore off: he welcomed me with great politene&s;s, and after thanking me for the honour I did him, in preventing his vi&s;it, he entered immediately upon the affair which had occa&s;ioned his &s;ending to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have, Sir, &s;aid he, &s;hewn &s;o truly a pater|nal affection for the young lady to whom I have paid my addre&s;&s;es, and are &s;o much e&s;teemed and reverenced by her, that I think I may without any impropriety, addre&s;s my&s;elf to you upon this occa&s;ion&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed a little perplexed.
<Q>To be &s;ure, added he, I ought to have done this before; my conduct mu&s;t have appeared capri|cious
<PB N="503" REF="103">
both to her and you, and indeed it was capricious,&mdash;but&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed again, and fixed his eyes on the ground. "His frankne&s;s, pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert, plea&s;ed me greatly, and di&s;po&s;ed me to give him a favourable attention."</P>
<P><Q>I cannot blame Mi&s;s Sophia, &s;aid he, for acting as &s;he has done; my heart did homage to her vir|tue at the time that I &s;uffered mo&s;t from the con|temptuous behaviour it &s;ugge&s;ted to her. Fain would I hope, added he &s;ighing, that the pre|judices &s;he has conceived again&s;t me has not en|tirely bani&s;hed me from her remembrance; the delicacy of my pa&s;&s;ion would be but ill &s;atis&s;fied by calling &s;o de&s;erving a woman my own, unle&s;s I could likewi&s;e boa&s;t a preference in her heart that left me no room to doubt my fortune had any &s;hare in determining her in my favour.</Q></P>
<P>"I know not, pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert, whether Sir Charles expected any an&s;wer to this declaration; it is certain he looked on me with a kind of anxious timidity, and &s;topped a moment; I continued &s;ilent, and he proceeded in this manner:"
<Q>I know, Mi&s;s Sophia has an under&s;tanding too &s;olid, and a mind too noble to &s;uffer any con&s;iderations of rank and fortune to determine her &s;olely in an affair upon which the happine&s;s of her life de|pends: &s;he would not &s;urely give her hand where her heart did not acknowledge a preference. 'Tis thus I an&s;wer all tho&s;e doubts which my &s;ituation, and perhaps an over&s;trained delicacy &s;ugge&s;t: I am impatient to convince her of the purity of my pa&s;&s;ion; and, con&s;idering you as her friend, her
<PB N="504" REF="104">
guardian, and one who is in the place of a father to her, I will take no &s;teps in this affair but &s;uch as have the &s;anction of your approbation; I will not even pre&s;ume to vi&s;it her without your per|mi&s;&s;ion: be you my advocate with her, tell her I lay my&s;elf and fortune at her feet, and will re|ceive her from your hand as the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing that heaven can be&s;tow on me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now, my child, pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert, looking on Sophia with a &s;mile, how would you have me an&s;wer to this di&s;cour&s;e? was it nece&s;&s;ary, think you, to play off a few female artifices here, and keep Sir Charles in doubt and anxious &s;u&s;pence, or did the apparent openne&s;s and candor of his procedure de&s;erve an equal degree of frankne&s;s on my part?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not to be doubted, &s;ir, &s;aid Sophia blu&s;hing, but that on this occa&s;ion, as on every other, you acted with the utmo&s;t prudence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I find, re&s;umed Mr. Herbert, that you are re|&s;olved beforehand, to approve of whatever I &s;aid: well then, I told Sir Charles, that his pre&s;ent de|claration entirely &s;atisfied me; that being fully convinced of his &s;incerity, I looked upon his offer as highly honourable and advantageous to you; and that I was very &s;ure you would have all the &s;en&s;e you ought to have of &s;o generous an affection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He then begged me to &s;et out immediately for this place, and prepare you to receive a vi&s;it from him. This reque&s;t I could not po&s;&s;ibly com|ply with, having bu&s;ine&s;s in town, which would nece&s;&s;arily detain me for &s;ome hours; but I pro|mi&s;ed him to go as &s;oon as that was di&s;patched, which probably might be in the afternoon.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="105">
<Q>He mode&s;tly a&s;ked my leave to accompany me; but this I declined, as fearing his &s;udden ap|pearance, without your being previou&s;ly acquaint|ed with what had pa&s;t, might occa&s;ion &s;ome perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s to you; &s;o it was agreed that he &s;hould come to-morrow.</Q></P>
<P>"To-morrow," replied Sophia, with an emotion &s;he was not able to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>Yes, my child, replied the good old man, have you any objections to this?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know not, replied Sophia, with downca&s;t eyes and a faultering accent, what I ought to do; I have been &s;o u&s;ed to con&s;ider Sir Charles's profe&s;|&s;ions in an unfavourable point of view; my heart has been &s;o accu&s;tomed to &s;u&s;pect him&mdash;to guard it&s;elf again&s;t delu&s;ive hopes, perhaps I ought not to admit his vi&s;it &s;o ea&s;ily; perhaps I ought to re&s;ent his former behaviour. I own I am greatly perplexed, but I will be determined wholly by your advice.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert &s;aw her delicate &s;cruples, and, to fa|vour her mode&s;ty, an&s;wered, with the authority of a guardian,
<Q>When Sir Charles vi&s;its you next, Mi&s;s Sophia, he comes to offer you his hand; he has a&s;ked my con&s;ent as your guardian and your friend; and, I pre&s;uming on my influence over you in both tho&s;e characters, have given it freely; and how indeed, having your intere&s;t and happine&s;s &s;incerely at heart, could I do otherwi&s;e? but if you think his former behaviour, in which however there were only &s;u&s;picions again&s;t him, de&s;erves to be re&s;ented, at a time when tho&s;e &s;u&s;|picions are ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, you mu&s;t go
<PB N="506" REF="106">
through with your heroi&s;m, and &s;ee him no more; for as the poet &s;ays,
<Q>He comes too near who comes to be denied,</Q>
&s;o he has offended too much who needs a pardon.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, who felt all the force of this rea&s;oning, an&s;wered only by a blu&s;hing &s;ilence. Mr. Herbert then told her, that Sir Charles had declared to him that he would make the &s;ame &s;ettlements on her as had been &s;tipulated for his mother; for he added, with equal delicacy and tenderne&s;s,
<Q>Mi&s;s Sophia, in virtue, wit, good &s;en&s;e, and every female ex|cellence, brings me an immen&s;e portion.</Q></P>
<P>"Sir Charles, pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert &s;miling, by a &s;trange contradiction, which is, I &s;uppo&s;e, always found in lovers, though he was impatient to have me with you, yet could not help detaining me to have the plea&s;ure of talking of you: he painted to me very naturally, the unea&s;ine&s;s he had &s;uffered from your &s;uppo&s;ed contempt of him: he told me, that he was at one time determined to travel, in or|der to efface you from his remembrance;"
<Q>But, (&s;aid he, ri&s;ing and unlocking a cabinet, from which he took out a paper and put into my hands,) you &s;hall judge whether amid&s;t all my re&s;entment I did not &s;till love Mi&s;s Sophia; that is my will, which I ordered to be drawn up pre|vious to my intended journey.</Q></P>
<P>"He then, to &s;pare me the trouble of reading it all through, pointed to the place where you was mentioned, and I found he had bequeathed you an e&s;tate of four hundred pounds a year for life, and five thou&s;and pounds to be di&s;po&s;ed of as you plea&s;ed."</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="107">This la&s;t circum&s;tance touched Sophia &s;o much that tears filled her eyes: &s;he &s;ighed, and turned her head a&s;ide to conceal her emotion, while Mr. Herbert, without &s;eeming to ob&s;erve it, continued to repeat to her &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by Sir Charles, which &s;hewed the greatne&s;s of his affection, and his veneration for her virtues.</P>
<P><Q>We parted at length, pur&s;ued Mr. Herbert, extremely well &s;atisfied with each other, and to|morrow, or next day at farthe&s;t, you may expect to &s;ee Sir Charles here; for he told me, that if he received no ill news from me, he would con|clude I had prepared him a favourable reception; and, pre&s;uming on this hope, he would immedi|ately &s;et his lawyer to work to prepare the wri|tings, that nothing might be left undone which could convince you of the &s;incerity of his af|fections; therefore, my dear child, &s;et your heart at re&s;t; and &s;ince providence has thought fit to reward your piety and virtue, receive with hum|ble gratitude that fortune to which you are rai&s;ed, and which puts it &s;o largely in your power to do good. I will now leave you, &s;aid the good old man ri&s;ing, to your own reflections; I have &s;carce &s;poke a word yet to our kind friends here, for I was &s;o impatient to &s;ee you, that I left them very abruptly.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert had no &s;ooner left the room, than Sophia, in an ardent ejaculation, thanked heaven for thus relieving her from her di&s;tre&s;s: but it was long ere the tumult in her mind rai&s;ed by &s;uch un|hoped for happy news &s;ub&s;ided, and gave place to that calm recollection which &s;upplied a thou&s;and
<PB N="508" REF="108">
plea&s;ing ideas, and filled her with the &s;ofte&s;t emo|tions of gratitude, tenderne&s;s, and joy.</P>
<P>She was now freed from tho&s;e tormenting doubts, which made her con&s;ider her tenderne&s;s for Sir Charles as a crime, and occa&s;ioned &s;o many pain|ful &s;truggles in her mind. What joy to reflect that the man &s;he loved was worthy of her affection! how plea&s;ing was the pro&s;pect that opened to her view; to be ble&s;t with the power of &s;hewing her gratitude to her friends, her piety to her mother; to repay her &s;i&s;ter's unkindne&s;s with acts of gene|ro&s;ity; and indulge the benevolence of her heart in relieving every di&s;tre&s;s which fell within her power to relieve!</P>
<P>The&s;e were the advantages which &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf in the change of her fortune, and for the&s;e her grateful heart lifted it&s;elf up every moment in thanks and prai&s;e to that providence that be|&s;towed them on her.</P>
<P>While Sophia was thus ab&s;orb'd in thought, Dolly opened the door, and running up to her, eagerly cried,
<Q>Tell me true, my dear mi&s;s, has not Mr. Herbert brought you &s;ome good news? I am &s;ure he has; I never &s;aw him &s;o joyful in my life, and you look glad too,</Q>
pur&s;ued &s;he, peering in her face with a &s;weet earne&s;tne&s;s.
<Q>May I not a&s;k you, Mi&s;s Darnley, what this good news is?</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may, my dear, &s;aid Sophia &s;miling, but not now; you &s;hall know all &s;oon. At pre&s;ent I would rather talk of your affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed I am greatly obliged to you, mi&s;s, &s;aid Dolly, for what you have done for me. Mrs.
<PB N="509" REF="109">
Gibbons &s;eems almo&s;t as kind to me as ever &s;he was, and you have talked &s;o &s;en&s;ibly to my mo|ther, that &s;he repents of her behaviour to Mrs. Gibbons; and &s;he likes Mr. William &s;o well, that I am &s;ure &s;he would be glad to be reconciled to her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That is what I have been labouring at all this time, re&s;umed Sophia. If Mrs. Law&s;on can be per&s;uaded to make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions to the fan|ta&s;tick old gentlewoman, all may go well yet: it &s;hall be my care to bring them together; and if my endeavours to produce a reconciliation fail, perhaps I may be able to engage a more power|ful mediator in your intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia had Sir Charles in her thoughts, who &s;he doubted not would readily undertake the cau&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lovers, and po&s;&s;ibly add &s;omething to her Dolly's portion, to le&s;&s;en the inequality there was between them in that point. She &s;poke with &s;uch a chearful confidence, that Dolly, full of hope and joy, thanked her with artle&s;s tran&s;ports of gra|titude that moved her even to tears.</P>
<P>The next day, though in expectation of &s;eeing Sir Charles, her heart laboured with a thou&s;and emotions; yet kindly attentive to the affairs of her friend, &s;he re&s;olved to make Mrs. Gibbons a vi&s;it, to prepare the way for the hoped for interview be|tween her and Mrs. Law&s;on. As &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;engaged her&s;elf from Mr. Herbert, &s;he &s;et out alone for Mrs. Gibbons's hou&s;e; but &s;carcely had &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t field when &s;he &s;aw William, who was as u&s;ual, &s;auntering about Mr. Law&s;on's grounds, in hopes of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="110">Sophia beckoned to him, and he flew to meet her; for, next to Dolly, he thought her the mo&s;t charming woman in the world; and he adored her for the goodne&s;s with which &s;he intere&s;ted her&s;elf in his and his Dolly's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When he drew near, Sophia told him &s;he was going to vi&s;it his aunt; the youth re&s;pectfully ex|pre&s;&s;ed his concern that his aunt could not have that honour; &s;he was gone, he &s;aid, to vi&s;it a relation who lived a few miles up the country.</P>
<P>Sophia then told him the de&s;ign upon which &s;he was going, and the favourable di&s;po&s;ition Mrs Law|&s;on was in.
<Q>I am per&s;uaded, &s;aid &s;he, all might be made up, if we could but bring them together. Mrs. Law&s;on only wants an opportunity to repair her fault; but how &s;hall we contrive to give her this opportunity? what expedient can we find out to overcome your aunt's ob&s;tinacy, and pre|vail upon her to enter Mrs. Law&s;on's door again?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know one, madam, &s;aid the youth &s;miling, which I think would do.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia concluding from the timidity of his look, that &s;he was concerned in this expedient, pre&s;t him to &s;peak freely, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t to the utmo&s;t of her power.</P>
<P><Q>My aunt, madam, &s;aid he, is as you know a great ob&s;erver of forms: &s;he would not for the world fall under the cen&s;ure of having failed in any part of ceremony or good breeding; now, madam, if you would be plea&s;ed to make a point of her returning your vi&s;it, and permit me to tell her that you are offended with her neglect,
<PB N="511" REF="111">
and that you in&s;i&s;t upon this proof of her polite|ne&s;s, I am per&s;uaded &s;he will come.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, &s;aid Sophia, &s;miling, if you are of opi|nion this will do, you have my con&s;ent to &s;ay whatever you think will affect her mo&s;t; make me as angry and as ceremonious as you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing &s;hall be wanting on my part to pro|mote the &s;ucce&s;s of this affair, added &s;he, with a graver look and accent; for I believe you have a &s;incere affection for my young friend, and I &s;hall not be at re&s;t till I &s;ee you both happy.</Q></P>
<P>The youth, in who&s;e brea&s;t the &s;weet benevolence of her looks and words excited the &s;tronge&s;t tran&s;|ports of gratitude, not able to find words to ex|pre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of her goodne&s;s, &s;uddenly threw him|&s;elf at her feet, and ki&s;&s;ed her hand with a mixture of tenderne&s;s and awe.</P>
<P>Sophia, &s;miling at this &s;ally, &s;tepped back a little; upon which he ro&s;e up, and with a graceful con|fu&s;ion paid her his thanks: &s;he again repeated her promi&s;e of &s;erving him, and took leave: he bowed low, following her for &s;ome time with his eyes, and &s;ent a thou&s;and kind wi&s;hes after her.</P>
<P>Sophia, at her return, acquainted Dolly with what had pa&s;&s;ed between her lover and her, and filled her with plea&s;ing hopes of the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme: but now the day wore away, &s;he was in continual expectation of &s;eeing Sir Charles; her heart throbbed with anxiety; every noi&s;e &s;he heard, &s;ounded like the trampling of hor&s;es, and then a univer&s;al trembling would &s;eize her. She dreaded, yet wi&s;hed for his arrival; and at every di&s;appoint|ment
<PB N="512" REF="112">
&s;he &s;ighed, and felt her heart &s;ink with tender de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Such were her agitations, till the evening being far advanced, &s;he gave up all hope of his coming that night. Mr. Herbert had a&s;&s;igned a very plea&s;|ing rea&s;on for his vi&s;it being deferred till the next day; and, her mind growing more compo&s;ed, &s;he went in &s;earch of the good old man, who, Dolly told her, was gone to walk in the meadows behind the hou&s;e; for &s;he had kept her&s;elf out of his &s;ight as much as po&s;&s;ible, unwilling that he &s;hould ob|&s;erve her emotions. She &s;aw him at a di&s;tance, walking with a &s;low pace, and &s;he perceived he &s;aw her; but to her great &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he &s;aw him cro&s;s into another field, and take a quite contrary way, on purpo&s;e to avoid her.</P>
<P>Struck with this little accident, &s;he &s;tood &s;till and pau&s;ed a few moments: &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;trange|ly alarmed, yet wondered why &s;he &s;hould be &s;o, and took her way back again to the hou&s;e with &s;ad forebodings on her mind.</P>

ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN, CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>IMmediately upon the marriage of Vortigern with the daughter of Hengi&s;t, great numbers of the northern nations, under the inclu&s;ive title of Saxons, ha&s;tened over to Britain, and the Britons received and paid them as confederates. Vorti|gern, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his father-in-law, a&s;|&s;igned Northumberland for their re&s;idence. As their numbers increa&s;ed, the payment of &s;uch fre&s;h &s;upplies grew burden&s;ome to the Britons. They de&s;ired the Saxons to depart; and alledged that they were not able to maintain &s;o many more troops than were &s;tipulated by treaty, or were nece&s;&s;ary for defence. The Saxons reli&s;hed their pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation too well to exchange it: they refu&s;ed to re|turn; &s;o that the Britons were compelled to rouze them&s;elves from every &s;ymptom of lethargy, and to a&s;&s;ume that glorious &s;pirit of liberty, which, whenever exerted in a proper manner, renders the Briti&s;h nation a powerful, and a happy people. They unanimou&s;ly ro&s;e up in arms again&s;t the Sax|ons, who were joined by the Scots and Picts. Many battles were fought, and great numbers of men were de&s;troyed; woods were burnt, churches
<PB N="514" REF="115">
were demoli&s;hed, and whole cities were depopu|lated. At length, many of the Saxons returned into Germany: Their return was owing to the warm reception which they met with from our ance&s;tors. The Britons might be plundered, but could not be ab&s;olutely conquered: they might be forced or betrayed into &s;lavery, but they had native &s;trength &s;ufficient &s;oon to un&s;hackle them|&s;elves, and to bur&s;t forth again into the plains of liberty. The Britons, as a national body, or as individual men, &s;eldom failed to appear with re|markable lu&s;tre under misfortunes and oppre&s;&s;ions. In milder times, they were either totally inactive, or impoliticly employed in di&s;putes and animo&s;ities among them&s;elves. They were naturally hone&s;t, indolent, and un&s;u&s;picious; too ea&s;ily captivated with &s;trangers; too ha&s;ty and irre&s;olute, and, con|&s;equently, too ea&s;ily led into danger and di&s;a&s;ters. The&s;e were &s;ome of their earlie&s;t, and the&s;e will probably be &s;ome of their late&s;t characteri&s;tics.</P>
<P>Nothing farther can be &s;aid with certainty: the latter end of Vortigern's reign is much ob|&s;cured amid&s;t fables and idle tales: he is generally de&s;cribed as a man much abandoned to his vices.</P>
<P>His &s;on Vortimer is &s;uppo&s;ed to have depo&s;ed his father, or at lea&s;t to have commanded the Britons again&s;t Hengi&s;t, Vortigern, and the Saxons: he is repre&s;ented as a prince of a more amiable cha|racter than Vortigern. He died before his father; and, after his death, Vortigern rea&s;&s;umed the reins of government, and became again one of the chief monarchs of Britain. Hengi&s;t &s;till remained king of Kent.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="116">Vortigern was very unacceptable to his &s;ubjects: he &s;hewed too great favour and partiality to the Saxons, who, by their cruelties, had rendered them&s;elves exceedingly terrible and odious. Vor|tigern, finding him&s;elf unea&s;y on his throne, re|tired with his family into Wales, and was buried at a place in Caernarvon&s;hire, which &s;till bears the name of Vortigern's Grave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where &s;ome years ago was found a &s;tone che&s;t, with the corp&s;e of a very tall man enclo&s;ed, &s;ays Mr. Carte.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The clouds of hi&s;tory are no where more ob|&s;cure than at this period. The antient hi&s;torians have mixed their narratives with legendary &s;tories: the modern writers have been at the pains to men|tion tho&s;e &s;tories; the hi&s;tory is &s;welled, but the in&s;truction from it is not encrea&s;ed. The uncer|tainty of chronology is another mo&s;t di&s;couraging circum&s;tance: the chronologi&s;ts differ very widely from each other. Every author who treats of tho&s;e times, fills his bucket, as he imagines, from the pure&s;t fountains; but tacitly endeavours to draw up &s;ome water from a different &s;tream than any that has been di&s;covered by his cotemporaries, or his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to remind our|&s;elves of the civil government that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the Britons, &s;ince that government will &s;oon be changed into another form.</P>
<P>The whole nation, as by the original con&s;titution, was &s;till divided into principalities. The principalities were very &s;mall: the head of each little colony was honoured &s;ometimes, not always, with the pompous title of a king.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="117">Several of the&s;e princes had been lately driven out of the kingdom by the outrages of the Sax|ons; and had been attended by great numbers of their &s;ubjects into Armorica <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bretaigne, a province of France.</NOTE>. They were received and protected by Aldroen, king of that country: but as &s;oon as they heard that the majority of Saxons were departed towards Germany, many of the Briti&s;h princes, again at|tended by their &s;ubjects, came back, and &s;ettled them&s;elves in the di&s;tricts which they had formerly governed. Ambro&s;uis Aurelianus was of the num|ber of tho&s;e who returned. He was king of Wilt|&s;hire, and his chief re&s;idence was called <HI>Urbs Am|bro&s;ii:</HI> the name of the place (Ame&s;bury) is &s;till in a great mea&s;ure retained. He was a young prince of Roman de&s;cent, and of a mo&s;t excellent character; warlike, mode&s;t, and amiable. As &s;ome period mu&s;t be affixt to his reign, although the be|ginning and end of it are both very uncertain, let us &s;uppo&s;e, from various &s;mall glimmerings, if they even may be called glimmerings of probability, that it began in the year 465, and ended in the year 508. In this &s;pace of forty-three years the general hi&s;torical records entirely con&s;i&s;t of diffe|rent battles and &s;ieges between our ance&s;tors and the Saxons, who had left Britain fully determined to return to a more effectual purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The methods which the Saxons took to effect their views of conque&s;t were gradual. From the year 437, Hengi&s;t bore the title of king of Kent:
<PB N="517" REF="118">
he reigned upwards of thirty years, and died, af|ter various &s;truggles with the Britons, in peaceful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his throne. He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on E&s;ca; and from him &s;prung a line of kings amounting, Hengi&s;t included, to &s;eventeen. The la&s;t of the kings of Kent was Baldred: he was driven out by Egbert, in the year 823.</P>
<P>The Saxons who had been &s;ettled in Northum|berland, or di&s;per&s;ed in other parts of the kingdom, received continual acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength by the ar|rival of their countrymen from Germany. The&s;e additional troops of &s;upply came in &s;mall numbers, but they came often; till, by degrees, the mo&s;t eminent chieftains appeared, and with them whole armies of followers and dependants.</P>
<P>Such was Ella, a Saxon of great power and dig|nity among his countrymen. He brought with him his two &s;ons, and a very con&s;iderable force. He landed in Su&s;&s;ex in the year 477; and, after much oppo&s;ition from the Britons, he conquered Su&s;&s;ex, and a great part of Surry. He did not a&s;&s;ume the title of king during the life of Hengi&s;t, from whom he probably received great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his conque&s;ts. He died in the year 514, after a reign of twenty-four years. His territories were called the kingdom of the South Saxons.</P>
<P>The third and next monarchy formed by the&s;e invaders, was the kingdom of the We&s;t-Saxons. The fir&s;t of the We&s;t Saxon kings was Cerdic: he landed in the year 495. From the very day on which he landed, till the year 519, he was at war with the Britons. In the&s;e battles the &s;ucce&s;s was
<PB N="518" REF="119">
various, and the lo&s;s on each &s;ide con&s;iderable: but Cerdic was con&s;tantly reinforced by fre&s;h recruits from Germany. The Britons, who had no &s;uch advantages, were at la&s;t &s;o effectually conquered, that Cerdic became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great part of Cornwall, and entirely of Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et|&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Somer&s;et&s;hire, Hamp&s;hire, and Berk&s;hire. He died in the year 534, and was &s;uc|ceeded by his &s;on Cenric. The We&s;t-Saxon kings were in number &s;eventeen, the la&s;t of whom be|came &s;ole monarch of Britain.</P>
<P>The fourth kingdom of the heptarchy was that of the Ea&s;t-Saxons. The fir&s;t monarch of that kingdom was Erkenwin. He began his reign in the year 527: he died in the year 560. His territories were E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, and part of Hertford&s;hire.</P>
<P>Northumberland was the fifth kingdom of the heptarchy. It contained Lanca&s;hire, York&s;hire, the bi&s;hopric of Durham, Cumberland, We&s;t|morland, Northumberland, and part of Scotland, as far as the frith of Edinburgh. Ida was the fir&s;t Saxon king of the&s;e provinces. He began his reign in the year 547, and died in the year 559. After his death, the kingdom of Northumberland was otherwi&s;e divided.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth was the kingdom of the Ea&s;t-Angles. It contained Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge&s;hire, and the i&s;le of Ely. Uffa, the fir&s;t monarch, be|gan his reign in the year 575: he died in the year 582. This kingdom was united to Mercia in the year 793.</P>
<P><PB N="519" REF="120">Mercia was the &s;eventh, and the large&s;t divi&s;ion of the Saxon heptarchy. It contained Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Hereford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick&s;hire, Lei|ce&s;ter&s;hire, Rutland&s;hire, Northampton&s;hire, Lin|coln&s;hire, Huntingdon&s;hire, Bedford&s;hire, Buck|ingham&s;hire, Oxford&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, Shrop|&s;hire, Nottingham&s;hire, Che&s;hire, and part of Hertford&s;hire. Cridda, the fir&s;t king, began his reign in the year 582, and died in 593. The fate of the&s;e &s;everal kingdoms needs not to be parti|culari&s;ed: let us return to take a review of the Britons under the reign of Ambro&s;ius.</P>
<P>Many of our hi&s;torians are of opinion, that Am|bro&s;ius is the &s;ame per&s;on as Natan-leod, who is repre&s;ented by the antient writers, as the greate&s;t of the Briti&s;h kings. In that point the de&s;cription an&s;wers the dignity of Ambro&s;ius, who, whil&s;t he lived, defended his territories with great magnani|mity, and often with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Natan-leod was &s;lain in a battle fought again&s;t the Saxons, near Charford, in Hamp&s;hire, when five thou&s;and Britons were left dead upon the field.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall be &s;aid of king Arthur? or at what time &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e that he reigned? &s;ince his very exi&s;tence it&s;elf is call'd in que&s;tion; and &s;ince he has unfortunately been celebrated by &s;o many fabulous writers, that his true hi&s;tory can never be known. That he exi&s;ted is beyond all doubt, and that he reigned is a point which many authors have &s;ufficiently proved: but the actions of this prince, although in them&s;elves brave and glorious, are &s;o outrageou&s;ly magnified, that the
<PB N="520" REF="121">
real &s;oldier is lo&s;t in the fictitious giant-killer; and the genuine and noble form of the hero is &s;o ut|terly di&s;&s;olved, that from a &s;ub&s;tance, it becomes a &s;hadow. I will endeavour to extract, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome gold from amid&s;t the hi&s;torical dro&s;s of the&s;e times. Probability mu&s;t be my be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the &s;earch.</P>
<P>Arthur was nearly related to Ambro&s;ius, Aureli|anus, perhaps directly de&s;cended from him. The be|ginning of Arthur's reign is a&s;&s;igned to the year 514. His coronation to the year 519. His victories over the Saxons are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been twelve in number; but the Saxons had already fixed them|&s;elves too deeply in our i&s;land to be rooted out by the &s;tronge&s;t hand: nor was Arthur always victo|rious, otherwi&s;e he would &s;carce have yielded up by a treaty with Cerdic, the counties of Somer&s;et and Southampton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamp&s;hire.</NOTE>; a ce&s;&s;ion which gave the We&s;t Saxons &s;uch great power, and &s;uch ea&s;y opportu|nities of encrea&s;ing their dominions, that in length of time, they ab&s;orb'd the re&s;t of the heptarchy, and terminated the entire monarchy of Britain in their own &s;overeign, king Egbert.</P>
<P>Arthur was a native of South Wales: his me|mory has been ever held in particular veneration by the Welch. One of the highe&s;t mountains in Brecnock&s;hire is called Arthur's chair <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cadair Arthur.</NOTE>, in honour of a prince who was remarkable pre-eminent. The fir&s;t part of his life was pro&s;perous, the latter end of it was unfortunate. During an expedition to the northern parts of the kingdom, where he was &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Britons again&s;t the Saxons, he left his patrimonial dominions, which were
<PB N="521" REF="122">
Cornwall, Devon&s;hire, and Dor&s;et&s;hire, to the go|vernment and care of his nephew Mordred, who proved unfaithful to his tru&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf of the throne. Arthur returned into Cornwall, attended by a numerous army: an engagement en&s;ued, Mordred was killed in the field of battle, Arthur was de&s;perately wounded, and died &s;oon afterwards, at the age of ninety years, &s;eventy-&s;ix of which he had exerci&s;ed in war. He was buried at Gla&s;tenbury, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and with him was interred the glory of the Britons. Arthur's death is fixed by all authors, in the year 542.</P>
<P>As I have mentioned the Welch, it may not be improper in this place to give &s;ome &s;hort account of a people, who have con&s;tantly held them&s;elves in a kind of &s;eparate and di&s;tinct &s;tate from the re&s;t of the Britons. In the time of the Romans, the inhabitants of North Wales were called Ordovices, and tho&s;e of South Wales were called Silures.</P>
<P>The counties of North Wales are Montgomery|&s;hire, Merioneth&s;hire, Denbigh&s;hire, Flint&s;hire, Car|narvon&s;hire, and the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey.</P>
<P>The counties of South Wales, are Monmouth|&s;hire, Brecknock&s;hire, Carmarthen&s;hire, Glamor|gan&s;hire, Cardigan&s;hire, and Pembroke&s;hire.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the fore&s;t of Dean, and of Hereford&s;hire, were al&s;o called Silures, and tho&s;e of Shrop&s;hire were reckoned among the Ordovices.</P>
<P>The Welch, or Cambrians were never entirely conquered: They had the &s;ame advantage as the Caledonians. When they found them&s;elves too hard pre&s;&s;ed, they retired within their mountains, and were &s;afe. They were of more generous, and

le&s;s rapacious di&s;po&s;itions than the Scots: they were an high &s;pirited people, ea&s;ily provoked, and very &s;harp in re&s;entment: they were hardy, like all mountaineers, well made, and robu&s;t in their per&s;ons: they were proud, not vain; fiery, not cruel: they married within their own tribes, and therefore are ju&s;tly looked upon even to this day, as the true&s;t and mo&s;t ancient Britons. The Ordo|vices remained longer than the Silures, in the &s;tate of a commonwealth, independant of any &s;ingle &s;overeign: but the whole kingdom of Cambria had certainly &s;ubmitted to a regal government long before the arrival of the Saxons, and even before the departure of the Romans. Their &s;overeigns were all cho&s;en by the people; but in what manner, I believe, cannot ea&s;ily be known: and although their names may be enrolled in the records of Wales, their particular hi&s;tories would be tedious and to no purpo&s;e. In the choice of Arthur, the Britons were entirely unanimous: he was an honour to the country where he was born, and a defence to the territories where he re&s;ided.</P>
<P>From the departure of the Romans, to the &s;et|tlement of the Saxons, Chri&s;tianity, by degrees, and at different periods, had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s into various parts of Britain. The fir&s;t &s;tep, and certainly a very wi&s;e one, was the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of &s;chools, in which the Britons in their earlie&s;t time of life were taught the doctrines of religion, and the principles of moral virtues. From &s;uch &s;eeds alone mu&s;t &s;pring every flouri&s;hing branch of civil government and order. A &s;chool under the conduct and care of Dubricius, is men|tioned
<PB N="523" REF="126">
as one of con&s;iderable note in tho&s;e times, Dubricius was a mo&s;t religious man, of great abi|lities, and of indefatigable indu&s;try. He was fir&s;t made bi&s;hop of Landaff, and was tran&s;lated from thence in the year 512, by the authority of a &s;ynod, to the archbi&s;hoprick of Kaer-leon, or Che&s;ter. I mention this circum&s;tance only to &s;hew that the Chri&s;tian church was then &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, as to be divided into &s;ees: and it will be found, upon looking into the voluminous hi&s;to|rians of our nation, that mona&s;teries had been erected, &s;ynods had been held, and even here&s;ies, particularly tho&s;e of Arian and Pelagius, had pre|vailed in Britain long before the perfection of the heptarchy. By the perfection, I mean the divi&s;ion of the kingdom into &s;even Saxon monarchies.</P>
<P>To give an hi&s;tory of the church, or to enter minutely into the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, would be a laborious, and a very unprofitable under|taking; neither &s;uitable to the intent of the&s;e pa|pers, nor available in any material point whatever. To our happine&s;s, and to our honour be it &s;poken, we have long ago thrown off the yoke of Rome: we have di&s;covered her pretended miracles, and we have de&s;pi&s;ed her idolatrous vanities. The memorials of her errors need not be minutely &s;pe|cified, unle&s;s when they are connected, or inter|woven with the &s;y&s;tems of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Saxons were de&s;cended from tho&s;e Germans who are often mentioned by Cae&s;ar, and fully de|&s;cribed by Tacitus; and who appeared under the denomination of Goths and Vandals, titles dread|ful to learning, and all the civil arts of peace!

they were a rude, robu&s;t, warlike people; and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted under a kind of government, to which it would be difficult to appropriate any general name. It was neither oligarchy, monarchy, democracy, nor commonwealth. Tacitus, in his account of the Germans, &s;ays, <HI>De minoribus rebus principes con|&s;ultant, de majoribus omnes. Ita tamen, ut ea quoque quorum penes plebem arbitrium e&s;t, apud principes per|tractentur.</HI>
<Q>The chieftains debated &s;olely upon matters of little con&s;equence: in matters of im|portance, all the people were con&s;ulted; but in &s;uch a manner, that whatever was left to the de|ci&s;ion of the people had fir&s;t been dige&s;ted by the chieftants.</Q>
A little farther, the &s;ame hi&s;torian tells us, <HI>Nihil autem neque publicae neque privatae rei ni&s;i armati agunt.</HI>
<Q>They never tran&s;act any bu&s;ine&s;s, either of a public or a private nature, unle&s;s they are armed.</Q>
Such were the abo|rigines of the Saxons, and from them is derived our Gothic cu&s;tom of wearing &s;words in all public places, and in all vi&s;its of ceremony, even to our neare&s;t friends and relations.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;y&s;tem of government might have prevailed among the&s;e northern nations, while they remained upon the continent, they were wi&s;e enough to perceive that the regal &s;tate was mo&s;t natural, and agreeable to the di&s;po&s;ition of the Britons. The fir&s;t &s;tep of Hengi&s;t was to make him&s;elf king. Six other Saxon chieftains, who&s;e names I have already mentioned, followed his example. The Britons fought often, and fought bravely in defence of their rights and pri|vileges, particularly the liberty of chu&s;ing their
<PB N="525" REF="130">
own kings: they were overpowered by numbers; and time, often the be&s;t friend to conque&s;t, inured them to Saxon monarchs, and to Saxon laws. Their own cu&s;toms were forgotten, and the cu&s;toms and religion of the conquerors were received. They even lo&s;t their name; and, from the Angles, will be called Engli&s;h, as long as the nation &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Saxons apparently laid the foundation of that mighty pillar of our &s;tate, a parliament: at lea&s;t the ba&s;is of it &s;eems to have been built upon the Saxon Wittena-Gemot. The column indeed has &s;ince been formed and fluted with all the power and &s;kill of architecture; and when a &s;overeign is properly placed upon the capital, the ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;everal parts, and the exactne&s;s and beauty of the proportions will be univer&s;ally admired, except by tho&s;e who think the king a &s;uperficial orna|ment. The Wittena-Gemot of the Saxons was an a&s;&s;embly in which all public and private bu|&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted. Leagues of alliance and af|finity with other nations were there determinately pa&s;&s;ed: inconveniencies were remedied, and rights were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;anctified by law. The a&s;|&s;embly was compo&s;ed of king, lords, and freemen. The debates were concluded by votes, and the numbers were determined by voices, unle&s;s when the noi&s;e was doubtful, and the majority uncertain: in that ca&s;e the votes were taken &s;everally.</P>
<P>In the year 596, Augu&s;tine the monk, &s;ince known by the name of St. Au&s;tin, was peremp|torily &s;ent into England by Pope Gregory the fir&s;t, to convert the Saxons from Pagani&s;m to Chri&s;ti|anity:
<PB N="526" REF="131">
he was attended by a company of Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, his brethren, of whom he was the chief: they landed in the i&s;le of Thanet, and &s;oon after|wards proceeded to Canterbury, where king Ethel|bert and his court then re&s;ided. They were re|ceived favourably by the king: a part of the city of Canterbury was a&s;&s;igned for their habitation, and they were permitted to preach the go&s;pel throughout the dominion of Kent. Augu&s;tine had undertaken the journey unwillingly: he had once ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, and had returned back to Rome, frightened at the terrible accounts which were given of our ance&s;tors. Gregory, who had undoubted a&s;&s;urances, that the Engli&s;h were ready to embrace Chri&s;tianity, &s;pirited up the timorous monk to pur&s;ue his intended journey, and the event proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that before the end of the year, more than ten thou&s;and Engli&s;h were con|verted. Among the&s;e was Ethelbert, king of Kent, who was looked upon as the &s;uperior king of the Saxons. In his conver&s;ion he was probably influ|enced by his queen Bertha, a prince&s;s of great piety, a daughter of France, and perhaps the only daughter of France who was ever of real advantage to England.</P>
<P>From this period, Chri&s;tianity, which had been much repul&s;ed, and damped, &s;ince the arrival of the Saxons, began to &s;hine out, &s;ometimes in greater, and at other times in le&s;&s;er degrees of lu&s;tre. Many of the Saxon kings were zealous chri&s;tians: their &s;ons and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors often returned to pagani&s;m. But the indefatigable indu&s;try of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, the dexterity with which they performed their miracles, the natural enthu&s;ia&s;m,
<PB N="527" REF="132">
doubts, and timid di&s;po&s;ition of mankind, were all circum&s;tances that tended, not indeed to introduce the doctrines of Chri&s;t, but to e&s;tabli&s;h and encrea&s;e the power of the pope, and to inculcate an implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to prie&s;ts of every degree and order; and mo&s;t e&s;pecially to monks. It plea&s;es God to permit us to wor&s;hip him in all the errors and infirmities of our nature: &s;uch is his will, and his will be done!</P>
<P>From the arrival of St. Augu&s;tine, to the end of the heptarchy, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;ingle monarch over the whole kingdom of England, is a &s;pace of about two hundred and thirty years. Throughout that period we might expect to find many remarkable events in a monarchy, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even royal branches; but &s;carce any part of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory is more &s;aple&s;s and unfruitful. The &s;cenes which heretofore repre&s;ented civil wars be|tween the native Britons, were now only changed into civil wars between tho&s;e Britons, and the en|grafted Saxons. The ambition and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;everal kings prevented an union in the general &s;y&s;tem of government. Each monarch &s;trove to extend his territories, and to enlarge his rights. We are at a lo&s;s to know in what particulars the&s;e rights con&s;i&s;ted. If from the materials of hi&s;tory that remain to us, we can form any exact notion of the rules of policy, by which the heptarchy was guided, we may conclude that one of the &s;even monarchs was &s;uperior to the re&s;t: a kind of pre|&s;ident to the regal council. All matters of im|portance, or relative to private property, were to be laid before him; but each of the other kings
<PB N="528" REF="133">
had an equal right of choice in every &s;ingle tran&s;|action that required approbation or di&s;&s;ent. The principal members of the Wittena-Gemot had no le&s;s a right of giving their voices, in points where the general welfare of the nation was in|cluded. This &s;eems to have been the Saxon form of government; and it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that the different prerogatives not only of the &s;everal kings, but of the individual members who compo&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly, might often cla&s;h, and give continual occa&s;ions for tho&s;e feuds and conte&s;ts, which are the principal records that occur to us in all ac|counts of the heptarchy.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF BIANCA CAPELLO CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P>THE furious Buonaventuri would not let her go on; but &s;tarting up, and running to her in a fury, &s;aid,
<Q>Go hang your&s;elf, and then howl to tho&s;e that will hear you in the other world: in this, I'll follow my own way; there|fore do not pretend to whine to me, but take care of your&s;elf, who are in more danger; for do you think, &s;trumpet, that I won't cut off that golden horn, which you have placed on my head, by &s;topping your windpipe with a knife one day or other.</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time the grand Duke being returned to his palace, could not re&s;t there, having ob&s;erved in Bianca, (in &s;pite of all her endeavours to hide it,) a great concern at his late di&s;cour&s;e; and impa|tient to give &s;ome &s;atisfaction either to her or him&s;elf, returned back; and not finding her in her apartment, &s;oftly de&s;cended the back-&s;tairs, from the door of which he overheard every word that had pa&s;&s;ed: and Pietro thus an&s;wering his wife, in a great rage turned his back, and went out of the
<PB N="530" REF="135">
hou&s;e. Deaf to all her calls, and de&s;pi&s;ing all her care, he left her overwhelmed with grief and tears; in which &s;he retired to her own apartment, without knowing Franci&s;co had been there, he having taken care to mount the &s;tair-ca&s;e fir&s;t, and get out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Here &s;he gave a loo&s;e to all her &s;orrows, enu|merating all her misfortunes, and lamenting the hour that brought her to the light of this world, where &s;he was doom'd to find them; and in a flood of tears, gave vent to the pa&s;&s;ion that filled her brea&s;t. Long would the&s;e reflections have em|ployed her time and thoughts, had not the grand Duke interrupted them, who coming into the room, and appearing ignorant of the matter, a&s;ked the cau&s;e; &s;aying,
<Q>To what are owing the&s;e tears, and the&s;e complaints? dearer than my &s;oul, tell me what misfortune has befallen you?</Q>
<Q>Nothing, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, occa&s;ions my concern but compa&s;|&s;ion for my hu&s;band, who as you have com|manded, I have admoni&s;hed; but he &s;eems &s;o little to regard his &s;afety, that I fear &s;ome mi&s;|chief will attend him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Is it nothing but that, (replied the grand Duke,) Oh, let him follow his own inclination, and at la&s;t he will find the con&s;equence: but why will you afflict and torment your&s;elf for what you cannot prevent? a torrent mu&s;t have way, or they that try to &s;top it may be drowned in it: Buonaventuri is head&s;trong, and void of under|&s;tanding, which will inevitably draw on his fate, if he does not quickly change his manners.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="531" REF="136">Yet after all this, the de&s;perate Pietro, full of indignation and revenge, meeting Ruberto Ricci next day at the column of the Santa Trinita, where he was talking with two other gentlemen; he clapt a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, &s;aying,
<Q>I don't know what hinders me, de&s;picable, infamous wretch that you are, from &s;hooting you this mi|nute through the heart: but &s;tay and hear what I have to &s;ay to you, for you &s;hall not e&s;cape me. I will go to your aunt, as often as I plea&s;e, in defiance of you; and if ever I know, or but gue&s;s, that you make the lea&s;t murmur or com|plaint to the grand Duke, you &s;hall not live an hour after it.</Q></P>
<P>Ricci being unarmed, and thus acco&s;ted, re|mained immoveable as a &s;tatue, till the other had done &s;peaking, and then, without the lea&s;t reply, went with his companions immediately to the grand Duke, who was at the Ca&s;ino, where he de|clared to him all that had pa&s;&s;ed ju&s;t before at the Column; to which the two gentlemen witne&s;&s;ing, the grand Duke, (who remembered his threats to his wife,) no longer doubting of his unbounded brutality, thought within him&s;elf, that there was no more time to be lo&s;t in inflicting on Pietro the puni&s;hment he de&s;erved; and taking Ricci apart, they talked together for &s;ome time in the garden, where the grand Duke having given him what di|rections he thought proper, &s;ent him away, and the next morning by times mounting on hor&s;eback, rode to his villa of Pratolino, where he &s;tayed all that day and the next night. The re&s;ult of their con|ference was, that Ricci &s;hould get together twelve
<PB N="532" REF="137">
companions, all men well armed, &s;trong, and re|&s;olute; &s;ome of whom had cutla&s;&s;es of &s;uch a tem|per, that with one &s;troke, they were able to cut off the head of a bull; for he knew that Buona|venturi was ever provided with pi&s;tols, and other arms from head to foot, in which equipage, he con&s;tantly went in the night to Bongianna's hou&s;e, not returning home till very late; &s;o that in order to be &s;ure of his prey, he divided his company, &s;etting two or more in different places, through which Pietro might pa&s;s; and his page (who per|&s;onally knew him) as centinel at the beautiful bridge of la Santa Trinita, to give notice when he &s;hould be there, for which Ruberto waited with great impatience, after he had made this di&s;po|&s;ition of his forces.</P>
<P>And now the unlucky lover having &s;pent the night with his mi&s;tre&s;s, ro&s;e before break of day, and taking leave of her went &s;lowly to his own hou&s;e. As he was walking over the bridge, the page gave two whi&s;tles, and then cry'd, alo! alo! the accu&s;tomed noi&s;e of the Florentine ruffians in tho&s;e days: at this the fierce Pietro, though unu&s;ed to fear, felt &s;ome pre&s;age of his approaching fate; and taking in his left hand a pi&s;tol, held it ready cocked, and with his drawn &s;word in his right, pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, that led directly to the great gate of his palace; but as his apartment was on the ground-floor, the door to it lay on the other &s;ide of the hou&s;e; &s;o that he was obliged, after de&s;cending the bridge, to turn down a little &s;treet, on the left hand of which, within a &s;tone's throw, was the entrance that he always kept the
<PB N="533" REF="138">
key of. Meeting in this narrow pa&s;&s;age two armed men, he did not immediately think they had any de&s;ign on him; but going a little farther, he &s;aw four more, who &s;topt his way, and the&s;e having joined the two fir&s;t, &s;ix others &s;tarted out and encom|pa&s;&s;ed him, with Ricci in the mid&s;t, crying out, kill, kill, the infamous traitor. Buonaventuri know|ing his voice, threw his cloak to the ground, and firing his pi&s;tol, hit one of them; but whil&s;t he was taking another out of his pocket, they all fell on him at once; yet by means of his armour, he e&s;caped for &s;ome time, making a very brave de|fence, and had already wounded two of them, when the a&s;&s;ailants renewing their attack, by the ad|vantage of their &s;hort arms, and the clo&s;ene&s;s of the &s;treet, &s;truck him at every blow, &s;o that being driven to the wall, he could do little damage with his &s;word: but as Ricci got under it, thinking to end him, he exerted all his force for one blow, and cut him quite thorough his iron head-piece to his &s;kull; at the &s;ight of which a cou&s;in of Ricci's, with a back &s;troke, wounded Pietro in the face, and repeating it with a &s;econd, &s;plit one &s;ide of his head, &s;o that his brains &s;tuck to the wall. Buonaven|turi finding him&s;elf dying, &s;aid, oh! no more for mercy, &s;ince I am dead, and dropt down; after which they all fell on him, &s;tabbing him in every part which his armour did not cover, and there left him, with no le&s;s than five and thirty mortal wounds. Ricci, as fa&s;t as he could, got to the palace of the prince&s;s I&s;abella, where, though his hurt was dan|gerous, he was by the help of a good &s;urgeon, cured in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P><PB N="534" REF="139">Not far from the place where this bloody &s;cene was acted, &s;tood an apothecary's &s;hop, the people of which, having heard the cla&s;h of arms and noi&s;e of men, with two of their boys, as it drew near day, went to &s;ee what was the matter, and there found the unfortunate Pietro bathed in his blood upon the ground, and by &s;ame faint &s;hort &s;ighs, could ju&s;t perceive he was not quite dead: upon which they run for a light, and immediately conveyed him to the neare&s;t church, named St. Jacopo, which &s;tands upon the river Arno.</P>
<P>The &s;un was no &s;ooner up than the death of Buonaventuri was &s;pread about the whole city; and coming to the ears of the poor deluded, but &s;till affectionate Bianca, almo&s;t di&s;tracted her. She, with the utmo&s;t violence of pa&s;&s;ion, was ready to de&s;troy her&s;elf, in order to follow him; which per|haps in the fir&s;t rage of &s;orrow &s;he might have done, (notwith&s;tanding the endeavours of all her friends and acquaintance who came to comfort her,) if the great Duke had not arrived at that juncture, to re&s;train and pacify her, which even he found difficulty in doing.</P>
<P>The next night after this had happened, as &s;oon as it was quite dark, two armed men ma&s;ked got into Bongianna's hou&s;e by the tiles, and cutting her throat left her dead on the floor: &s;uch was the mi&s;erable end of the&s;e thoughtle&s;s lovers, and &s;uch the re|venge taken by this lady's relations, for the infamy &s;he had brought upon them.</P>
<P>The grand Duke, that he might not &s;eem to know of this execution, put on all the appearance of anger and inqui&s;ition after the actors in it; but
<PB N="335" REF="140">
took care they never &s;hould be di&s;covered, &s;o that by degrees the affair was dropt; and Ricci un&s;u&s;|pected went about as before.</P>
<P>Time, which alleviates all affliction, had now re|&s;tored Bianca to her&s;elf, who&s;e charms and merits the Grand Duke grew every day more &s;en&s;ible of; and reflecting that his love alone had ob&s;cured her virtues, which in them&s;elves were both great and many, and that her birth, though not royal, was illu&s;trious, re&s;olved to give the utmo&s;t proof of a &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion, by &s;haring his power and title with her who had already all his heart; and on the evening of the 22d of June, 1579, publicly married her; commanding the &s;enate of forty eight, to do her homage as grand Dutche&s;s, and the next day &s;he went out as &s;uch, with the German guard, and a train of eight coaches. To compleat her glory, the &s;enate of Venice, when they heard &s;he was be|come great Dutche&s;s of Tu&s;cany, not only repealed their former acts again&s;t her, but made a new one, by which &s;he was adopted daughter of that &s;tate, which &s;ent a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y with it to the grand Duke, and a dowry &s;uitable to the dignity they had given her.</P>
<P>When the &s;udden marriage of Franci&s;co was effected, the cardinal Ferdinando, his next brother, re&s;ided at Rome, where he received the news of it with the greate&s;t indignation, his haughty &s;oul not enduring any alliance below that of a crowned head; and he e&s;teemed his blood &s;o much di&s;graced by this marriage, that he &s;et a thou&s;and machines at work, to take away (what he called) the &s;hame of his family, by the death of Bianca; whom he
<PB N="536" REF="141">
oftentimes attempted to poi&s;on, either by means of her &s;ervants, or pre&s;ents that he &s;ent her. His de&s;igns by one accident or other, being di&s;covered, made her very cautious, nor was he le&s;s &s;u&s;picious of her, fearing to meet the &s;ame fate he had de&s;igned to give; &s;o that a mutual hate reign'd in both, though both di&s;gui&s;ed it, out of regard to the grand Duke.</P>
<P>It happened one time among&s;t others, that the cardinal being at Florence, and they all dining together, the grand Dutche&s;s had that morning taken a fancy to make a tart with her own hands, which, towards the latter end of the dinner was &s;erved up with other things of the &s;ame &s;ort; and when Ferdinando was de&s;ired to ta&s;te of it, he put it off, and began &s;ome gay di&s;cour&s;e, that he might not appear to have any thought about it. At la&s;t the grand Duke, (after having a&s;ked his brother &s;everal times to ta&s;te what Bianca had made,) &s;aid, &s;ince none el&s;e will begin, I mu&s;t, and took a piece and eat it: after which the grand Dutche&s;s did the like, and the conver&s;ation continued for &s;ome time with the &s;ame good humour, when all of a &s;udden they both felt &s;uch violent and &s;trong pains in their bowels, that they were obliged to retire to their apartment, and go to bed; where they waited in vain for remedies and phy&s;icians, the cardinal having given &s;trict commands, that none &s;hould come near them, him&s;elf and his crea|tures keeping guard at the doors for that purpo&s;e; whil&s;t the poor unhappy princes expired in tor|tures, on the 28th of October, 1586. He buried them by each other, with all due honours: him&s;elf
<PB N="537" REF="142">
renouncing the cardinal's hat, was immediately ac|knowledged grand Duke of Tu&s;cany; through all which he cau&s;ed a report to be &s;pread, that Bi|anca Capello intended to poi&s;on him, which he pretended he di&s;covered by means of a ring he al|ways wore, the &s;tone in it being of a nature to change colour at the approach of poi&s;on; and &s;o he avoided ta&s;ting the tart, which &s;he &s;eeing her hu&s;band do, rather than outlive him, or di&s;cover her treachery, cho&s;e to eat the re&s;t; but however this &s;tory was &s;trengthened by authority, very few believed it; for be&s;ides the improbability of her killing her&s;elf, with that coolne&s;s, when &s;he might have found a hundred pretences to hinder Fran|ci&s;co from eating the tart, without di&s;covering her|&s;elf, (and would no doubt if &s;he had known it to be poi&s;oned) many circum&s;tances concurred to make it plainly a contrivance of the cardinals, who had bribed the &s;ervant that provided the materials for the tart, to put poi&s;on among&s;t them. But as Franci&s;co dying without a &s;on, left Ferdinando his heir, the nobles thought it wi&s;er to receive with a good grace their living prince, than hazard their &s;afeties, by a vain inquiry after the dead one, tho' a man beloved and e&s;teemed, a fine gentle|man and great governor, all the arts and &s;ciences being in perfection in his time, as may be &s;een by their be&s;t poets and hi&s;torians, who all dedicated their works to him.</P>

I knew your father's inflexible temper, and was con|vinced he would never &s;et you at liberty while there was a po&s;&s;ibility of your marrying made|moi&s;elle de Lu&s;&s;an. I re&s;olved to &s;peak to that generous young lady: I told her my fears for your health; &s;he partook in them, &s;he felt them perhaps with more force than I did. From that moment I &s;aw her u&s;e every endeavour to ha&s;ten her marriage; for her father, ju&s;tly ir|ritated at the proceedings of mon&s;ieur de Com|minge, had long pre&s;&s;ed her to marry: hitherto &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted his &s;olicitations, and even his commands. I asked her which of tho&s;e per&s;ons who addre&s;&s;ed her, &s;he would chu&s;e? It matters not which, replied &s;he; they are all equal to me, &s;ince I cannot be his to whom I have given my heart. Two days after I had this con&s;ervation with her, I learned that the marquis de Bena|vides was preferred to all his rivals; every one was &s;urpri&s;ed at her choice, and I as much as any other. Benavides has a di&s;agreeable per|&s;on, his under&s;tanding is mean, and his temper extremely bad: this la&s;t circum&s;tance made me tremble for poor Adelaida. I was re&s;olved to tell her my apprehen&s;ions: I went for that pur|po&s;e to the hou&s;e of the counte&s;s de Garlande, where we u&s;ed to meet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am prepared, &s;aid &s;he, for mi&s;ery, but I mu&s;t marry; and &s;ince I know it is the only
<PB N="540" REF="145">
means of procuring your &s;on's liberty, I reproach my&s;elf every moment that I delay this &s;acrifice: yet this marriage, which I con&s;ent to only for his &s;ake, will perhaps be the mo&s;t cruel of his mi&s;fortunes. I will at lea&s;t convince him by my choice, that his intere&s;t was the &s;ole motive which engaged me to it. Pity me, dear Ma|dam, I de&s;erve your pity; and, by my behavi|our to Mon&s;. Benavides, I will endeavour to render my&s;elf worthy of your e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P>My mother afterwards told me, that Adelaida was made acquainted by my father him&s;elf, with my having burnt the writings: he publicly upbraided her with it on the day that he lo&s;t his proce&s;s.
<Q>She confe&s;&s;ed to me, added my mother, that &s;he was more affected with your extreme delicacy in con|cealing &s;o generous an action, than with the ac|tion it&s;elf.</Q>
We pa&s;&s;ed the days in &s;uch conver|&s;ations: my melancholy was exce&s;&s;ive; yet, tho' deprived of hope, I found a kind of &s;weetne&s;s in the idea of my being &s;till loved.</P>
<P>After a &s;tay of two months, my mother received orders from my father to return to him. He had expre&s;&s;ed no concern for my illne&s;s, and his cruel treatment of me had extingui&s;hed every &s;entiment of tenderne&s;s for him. My mother pre&s;&s;ed me to go with her; but I intreated her to con&s;ent to my &s;taying in the country: &s;he yielded to my rea&s;ons, and left me. I was now once more alone in the mid&s;t of my woods, and found &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s in &s;olitude, that I would then have abandoned every thing, and taken up my habitation in &s;ome hermit's cell, had I not been re&s;trained by my ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="541" REF="146">
for my mother. I often re&s;olved to en|deavour to &s;ee Adelaida, but the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing her &s;topt me. At length after long irre&s;olution, I thought I might at lea&s;t attempt to &s;ee Adelaida without being &s;een by her.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I re&s;olved to &s;end a per&s;on in whom I could confide to Bourdeaux, to know where &s;he was, and for this purpo&s;e I fixed upon a man who had attended me from my infancy. My mother, during my illne&s;s, had re&s;tored him to his place about me: he had been with me at the baths; he knew Adelaida; and when I mentioned my de&s;ign to him, he informed me that he had friends in the hou&s;e of Benavides. After having given him his orders, which I repeated a thou&s;and times, I cau&s;ed him to &s;et out from the ca&s;tle. When he arrived at Bourdeaux, he was informed that Benavides had carried his lady a &s;hort time after his marriage to an e&s;tate which he had in Bi&s;cay. Saint Laurent, for that was my &s;ervant's name, wrote to me to know what he was to do next: I &s;ent him orders to go immediately into Bi&s;cay. My de&s;ire of &s;eeing Adelaida was &s;o much increa&s;ed by the hope I had conceived, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to op|po&s;e it any longer.</P>
<P>Saint Laurent returned at the expiration of &s;ix weeks, which my anxiety and impatience had lengthened into &s;o many ages. He told me, that, after many fruitle&s;s attempts, Benavides having oc|ca&s;ion for an architect, he had prevailed upon his friend to pre&s;ent him to him in that quality; that having acquired &s;ome knowledge of the art from an uncle, under who&s;e care he had been brought
<PB N="542" REF="147">
up, he made no &s;cruple to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s Benavides employed him in.
<Q>I believe, &s;aid he, that Madame de Benavides knew me, for &s;he blu&s;hed when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw me.</Q></P>
<P>He then told me that &s;he lived the mo&s;t retired and melancholy life imaginable: that her hu&s;band hardly ever quitted her a moment; and that it was &s;aid in the hou&s;e, he was exce&s;&s;ively fond of her; but that he gave her no other proof of it, than by his extreme jealou&s;y, which he carried &s;o far, that even his brother had not the liberty of &s;eeing her, but when he was pre&s;ent. I a&s;ked my &s;ervant &s;ome que&s;tions about that brother; he told me that he was a very amiable young man, and that the world &s;poke as much in his favour as they did to the di&s;advantage of Benavides; and that he ap|peared to be greatly attached to his &s;i&s;ter-in-law.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e made no impre&s;&s;ion upon me at that time; the unhappy &s;ituation of Madame de Benavides, and the de&s;ire of &s;eeing her, employed my whole &s;oul. Saint Laurent a&s;&s;ured me he had taken proper mea&s;ures for introducing me into the hou&s;e of Benavides.
<Q>He has occa&s;ion for a painter, &s;aid he to me, to paint an apartment: I promi&s;ed to bring a good one, and you mu&s;t un|dertake this bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing now remained but to regulate our de|parture; I wrote to my mother, and told her I was going to pa&s;s &s;ome time at the hou&s;e of one of my friends. This done I &s;et out with Saint Laurent for Bi&s;cay: during our journey, I was continually a&s;king him que&s;tions concerning Madame de Be|navides; I was de&s;irous of knowing the &s;lighte&s;t
<PB N="543" REF="148">
particulars relating to her. Saint Laurent was not able to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity; he had but few op|portunities of &s;eeing her: &s;he was &s;hut up in her own apartment, with no other company but a little dog, of which &s;he was extremely fond. This ar|ticle touched me particularly: I had pre&s;ented her with that dog, and I flattered my&s;elf that &s;he loved it for my &s;ake. The&s;e little things, which e&s;cape one in good fortune, affect one &s;en&s;ibly in mi&s;ery: the heart, in the need it has of con&s;olation, fa&s;tens upon every thing which is likely to afford it.</P>
<P>Saint Laurent often mentioned to me the great attachment of young Benavides to his &s;i&s;ter-in-law; he added, that he often oppo&s;ed the furious &s;allies of his brother's temper, and, but for his good of|fices, Adelaida would be &s;till more mi&s;erable than &s;he was. He earne&s;tly intreated me to be con|tented with the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, and to make no attempt to &s;peak to her,
<Q>not becau&s;e it would endanger your life, added he: that, I know, is too weak a motive to re&s;train you; but becau&s;e &s;he will &s;uffer by any imprudence you may be guilty of.</Q></P>
<P>The liberty of &s;eeing Adelaida appeared to me &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, that I was fully per&s;uaded that alone would &s;atisfy me, and re&s;olved within my&s;elf, and promi&s;ed Saint Laurent, to behave with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. After a mo&s;t tedious journey, as my impatience made it &s;eem, we arrived at Bi&s;cay, and was pre&s;ented to Benavides, who &s;et me to work immediately.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed architect and I were lodged in the &s;ame apartment, and to him was committed the
<PB N="544" REF="149">
care of over&s;eeing the workmen. I had been &s;e|veral days at work before I &s;aw madame de Bena|vides; at length I perceived her one evening from a window in my own room going to walk in the garden. She had only her little favourite dog with her: her dre&s;s was negligent, a kind of langui&s;hing melancholy appeared in her looks and motions, and her fine eyes &s;eemed to dwell on the objects around her, without regarding them. Oh heavens! what &s;weetly painful emotions did my &s;oul feel at the &s;ight of her. I continued leaning on the window the whole time &s;he &s;taid in the garden: it was dark when &s;he returned; &s;o that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h her when &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by my window, but my heart knew it was her.</P>
<P>I &s;aw her a &s;econd time in the chapel of the ca&s;tle; I placed my&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that I could look at her the whole time without being ob&s;erved. She never once turned her eyes upon me: I ought to have rejoiced at this circum&s;tance, &s;ince I well knew that if &s;he di&s;covered me, &s;he would be obliged to go out of the chapel; yet I was af|flicted at it, and returned to my chamber in greater di&s;quiet than when I left it. I had not yet formed any de&s;ign of making my&s;elf known to her; but I was &s;en&s;ible that I &s;hould not be able to re&s;i&s;t do|ing it, if an opportunity offered.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of young Benavides gave me likewi&s;e &s;ome kind of unea&s;ine&s;s; he often came to &s;ee me work, and notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming di&s;tance of our rank, he behaved to me with an obliging fami|liarity, which ought to have excited my e&s;teem; yet it had no effect on me. His great merit, and
<PB N="545" REF="150">
the amiablene&s;s of his per&s;on, which I could not but be &s;en&s;ible of, with-held my gratitude. I was afraid of a rival in him, and a certain impa&s;&s;ioned &s;adne&s;s that I perceived in him, which was too like my own not to proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, gave me a &s;u&s;picion which he &s;oon confirmed.</P>
<P>After a&s;king me one day &s;everal que&s;tions re|lating to my condition in life;
<Q>You are in love, (&s;aid he to me, &s;ighing imperceptibly to him&s;elf,) the melancholy in which I perceive you continually plunged, per&s;uades me that your heart is not well: tell me the truth; can I do any thing for you? The mi&s;erable in general have a claim to my compa&s;&s;ion; but there is one &s;ort of grief which I pity more than any other.</Q>
I believe I thanked Don Gabriel, (that was his name,) with a very ill grace, for the kind offers he made to me; however, I could not help owning to him that I was in love: but I told him that time only could produce any change in the &s;tate of my for|tune.
<Q>You are not ab&s;olutely unhappy, replied he, &s;ince you may hope for a change; I know per&s;ons who are much more to be pitied than you.</Q></P>
<P>When I was alone I reflected upon the conver|&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed betwen Don Gabriel and my|&s;elf; I concluded that he was in love, and that his charming &s;i&s;ter-in-law was the object of his pa&s;&s;ion: his whole behaviour, which I examined with the utmo&s;t attention, convinced me I was not mi&s;|taken; I ob&s;erved him always a&s;&s;iduous about Adelaida; he gazed on her with eyes like mine, yet I was not jealous: my e&s;teem for Adelaida
<PB N="546" REF="151">
would not admit of &s;uch an injurious &s;entiment; but I could not help fearing, that the company of an agreeable man, who was continually rendering her &s;ervices that &s;oftened the horrors of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, would make her reflections on me be greatly to my di&s;advantage, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion had been productive of nothing but misfortunes to her.</P>
<P>I was full of the&s;e thoughts, when one day I &s;aw Adelaida enter the room where I was painting, led by Don Gabriel.
<Q>Why, &s;aid &s;he, do you pre&s;s me to come and look at the ornaments of this apartment? you know I have no ta&s;te for the&s;e things.</Q>
<Q>I hope, madam, (&s;aid I, looking earne&s;tly upon her, and bowing low,) that if you will deign to ca&s;t your eyes upon what is here, you will find &s;omething not unworthy your at|tention.</Q></P>
<P>Adelaida, &s;truck with the &s;ound of my voice, turned in&s;tantly towards me. I perceived &s;he knew me, for &s;he blu&s;hed and bent her eyes on the ground, and, after pau&s;ing a moment, &s;he left the room without giving me a look, &s;aying, that the &s;mell of the paint was di&s;agreeable to her.</P>
<P>I remained behind, terrified, confu&s;ed, and over|whelmed with grief. Adelaida had not deigned to give me a &s;econd look; &s;he would not even &s;hew that &s;he was enough intere&s;ted in my di&s;gui&s;e to expre&s;s any &s;igns of re&s;entment at it. What have I done, &s;aid I, I am indeed come hither contrary to her commands; but if &s;he &s;till loves me, &s;he would pardon a fault that proceeded from the exce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion for her. I now concluded, that &s;ince Adelaida no longer loved me, &s;he mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="547" REF="152">
have be&s;towed her heart upon another. This idea filled me with a grief &s;o new and violent, that I thought I had never been truly mi&s;erable till then.</P>
<P>Saint Laurent, who came from time to time to &s;ee me, entering the room that moment, found me in an agitation that made him tremble.
<Q>What ails you, &s;ir, &s;aid he to me, what has happened to you?</Q>
<Q>I am undone, replied I; Adelaida no longer loves me: &s;he no longer loves me, re|peated I; it is but too true, alas! I never had rea&s;on to complain of my fate till this cruel mo|ment: what torment would I now endure to pur|cha&s;e this ble&s;&s;ing which I have lo&s;t! this ble&s;|&s;ing which I preferred to all things, and which in the mid&s;t of my greate&s;t mi&s;eries, filled my heart with &s;o &s;oft a joy.</Q></P>
<P>I continued a long time to exclaim in this man|ner, while Saint Laurent in vain endeavoured to draw from me the cau&s;e of my grief. At length I related to him what had happened.
<Q>I &s;ee no|thing in all this, &s;aid he, which ought to drive you to the de&s;pair I &s;ee you in. Madam de Be|navides is certainly offended at your ra&s;h at|tempt. She was de&s;irous of puni&s;hing you by appearing indifferent; and perhaps &s;he was ap|prehen&s;ive of betraying her&s;elf, if &s;he had looked upon you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, no, interrupted I, they who love have no &s;uch command over them&s;elves in tho&s;e fir&s;t emotions; the heart alone is li&s;tened to. I mu&s;t &s;ee her, added I, I mu&s;t reproach her with her change. Alas! after giving her&s;elf to another,
<PB N="548" REF="153">
ought &s;he to take away my life by &s;o cruel an indifference? why did &s;he not leave me in my pri&s;on, there I &s;hould have been happy, had I been a&s;&s;ured of her love.</Q></P>
<P>Saint Laurent fearing that any one &s;hould &s;ee me in the condition I was in, obliged me to retire to the chamber where we both lay. I pa&s;t the whole night in tormenting my&s;elf; my thoughts were at &s;trife with each other; in one moment I condemned my &s;u&s;picions, and the next relap&s;ed into them again. I thought it unju&s;t to wi&s;h that Adelaida &s;hould pre&s;erve a tenderne&s;s which ren|dered her mi&s;erable. In tho&s;e moments, I re|proached my&s;elf for loving her le&s;s than my own &s;atisfaction.
<Q>Why &s;hould I wi&s;h to live, &s;aid I to Saint Laurent, if &s;he loves another: I will en|deavour to &s;peak to her, only to bid her an eter|nal adieu: &s;he &s;hall hear no reproaches from my mouth; my grief, which I cannot conceal from her, &s;hall &s;peak for me.</Q></P>
<P>When this point was re&s;olved upon, it was agreed that I &s;hould leave Bi&s;cay as &s;oon as I &s;hould have an interview with her; we then began to con&s;ider upon the nece&s;&s;ary means of procuring it. Saint Laurent told me that we mu&s;t &s;eize the fir&s;t op|portunity that offered, when Don Gabriel went to hunt, as he often did, and Benavides was employed in his dome&s;tic affairs; for which he always &s;et apart two mornings in the week. He then made me promi&s;e, that to avoid giving any &s;u&s;picion, I &s;hould go on with my painting, as u&s;ual; but that I &s;hould likewi&s;e declare, that I was under a nece&s;&s;ity of re|turning &s;oon to my own country.</P>
<P><PB N="549" REF="154">Accordingly I re&s;umed my former employment. I had almo&s;t, without perceiving it, &s;ome hope that Adelaida would come again into that apartment; every noi&s;e that I heard gave me an emotion I was &s;carce able to bear. In this &s;ituation I remained &s;everal days, and then lo&s;ing all hope of &s;eeing Ade|laida in that manner, I eagerly &s;ought for &s;ome moment in which I might be &s;o fortunate as to find her alone. At length this moment came; I was going as u&s;ual to my work, when I &s;aw Ade|laida pa&s;&s;ing to her own apartment. I knew that Don Gabriel went out early that morning to hunt, and I had heard Benavides talking in a low hall of the ca&s;tle, to one of his farmers; &s;o that I was pretty certain of finding her alone.</P>
<P>I entered her apartment with &s;o much precipi|tation, that Adelaida &s;aw me not till I was very near her: &s;he would have retired to her clo&s;et as &s;oon as &s;he perceived me, but I catched hold of her robe, and prevented her.
<Q>Do not fly from me, madam, &s;aid I to her, &s;uffer me this la&s;t time to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of beholding you: I &s;hall ne|ver importune you more. I am going far from you, to die with grief for the mi&s;eries I have been the cau&s;e of to you; and for the lo&s;s of your heart. I wi&s;h Don Gabriel may be more for|tunate than I have been.</Q></P>
<P>Adelaida, who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e had hitherto prevented her from &s;peaking, interupted me at the&s;e words, and giving me a look of mingled tenderne&s;s and anger,
<Q>What, &s;aid &s;he, dare you make me re|proaches? dare you &s;u&s;pect me?&mdash;you&mdash;.</Q>
The tone with which &s;he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words,
<PB N="550" REF="155">
brought me in&s;tantly at her feet.
<Q>No, my dear Adelaida, interupted I, no, I have no &s;u&s;picion that is injurious to you: pardon a few di&s;tracted words, which my heart di&s;avows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I pardon you all, &s;aid &s;he to me, provided you depart immediately, and never attempt to &s;ee me more. Reflect, that it is for your &s;ake I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature in the world; would you give me cau&s;e to reproach my&s;elf with being the mo&s;t criminal.</Q>
<Q>I will do every thing you command me, replied I, but only promi&s;e that you will not hate me.</Q></P>
<P>Although Adelaida had &s;everal times de&s;ired me to ri&s;e, yet I &s;till continued at her feet. To tho&s;e who truly love, this attitude has a thou&s;and &s;ecret charms. I was &s;till kneeling, when Benavides &s;ud|denly opened the chamber door. Tran&s;ported with rage, he flew towards his wife, and drawing his &s;word, "Thou &s;halt die, perfidious woman," cried he, and would have infallibly killed her, had I not thrown my&s;elf between them, and put by his &s;word with my own.</P>
<P><Q>Wretch! cried Benavides, you fir&s;t &s;hall feel my vengeance,</Q>
and at the &s;ame time gave me a wound on my &s;houlder. I did not love life well enough to be &s;olicitous for the pre&s;ervation of it; but my hatred to Benavides would not &s;uf|fer me to abandon it to his fury: this cruel attempt upon the per&s;on of his wife, deprived me almo&s;t of rea&s;on. I threw my&s;elf upon him, and plunging my &s;word in his body, he fell at my feet without &s;en&s;e or motion. The &s;ervants, drawn by the cries of madame de Benavides, entered the room that mo|ment,
<PB N="551" REF="156">
and &s;everal of them throwing them&s;elves upon me, di&s;armed me, while I made no effort to defend my&s;elf. The &s;ight of madame de Benavides bathed in tears, and kneeling by her hu&s;band, left me no &s;en&s;ibility of any thing but her grief. I was dragged out of her chamber into another, and the door fa&s;tened upon me.</P>
<P>There it was, that delivered up to my own re|flections, I &s;aw the aby&s;s into which I had plunged madame de Benavides: the death of her hu&s;band, killed before her eyes, and killed by me, could not fail of giving ri&s;e to &s;u&s;picions again&s;t her. How did I not reproach my&s;elf! I had been the cau&s;e of her fir&s;t misfortunes, and I had now com|pleted her ruin by my imprudence. My imagi|nation continually repre&s;ented to me the dreadful condition in which I had left her. I acknowledge that &s;he had ju&s;t rea&s;ons to hate me, and I did not murmur at it. The only con&s;olation I had, was in the hope that I was not known. The idea of being taken for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and a robber, which on any other occa&s;ion would have made me tremble with horror, now gave me joy. Adelaida knew the in|nocence of my, intentions, and Adelaida was the whole world to me.</P>
<P>Impatient to be interrogated, that I might clear the honour of Adelaida, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours in the mo&s;t racking inquietude: in the middle of the night my chamber door was opened, and I &s;aw Don Gabriel enter.</P>

<P>We have formerly remarked that the brain of infants is very hot and moi&s;t, which therefore &s;ub|jects them to be in continual motion. This &s;oft|ne&s;s of the brain is the rea&s;on why the images of all &s;en&s;ible objects impre&s;s them&s;elves thereon very ea&s;ily, and in very lively characters: we &s;hould not let &s;lip this opportune &s;ea&s;on; but then, be careful in our choice of the images to be engraved, for in a receptacle &s;o &s;mall and &s;o precious, none but very valuable things ought to be depo&s;ited; nothing but what we may wi&s;h to remain there during life. The fir&s;t let of images engraven while the brain is &s;o &s;oft, and entirely unoccupied, are always the deepe&s;t: as it dries they harden, and become inde|lible; hence it is, that though grown old, we re|member the pa&s;&s;ages of our youth, through a long &s;pace of time, di&s;tinctly; but tho&s;e of our more ad|vanced age, in a much &s;lighter manner, becau&s;e tho&s;e traces were drawn in the brain already dried and marked with many other figures.</P>
<P>Perhaps this kind of rea&s;oning will with difficulty be admitted; neverthele&s;s, it is certain every one talks in this way without perceiving it: do we not &s;ay every day, I have taken my bia&s;s, I am too old to change, I was brought up to this? and be&s;ides, is there not a particular plea&s;ure in recalling the images of our youth? the &s;tronge&s;t inclinations, are they not &s;uch as were taken at that age? and does not all this prove that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions and fir&s;t habits are the mo&s;t prevalent?</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="159">Now, though infancy is the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on for engraving images on the brain, yet it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, not to be the &s;ame with re&s;pect to rea&s;oning: that humidity, which &s;o ea&s;ily admits impre&s;&s;ion, being joined to a great degree of warmth, is pro|ductive of an un&s;ettledne&s;s that is an enemy to clo&s;e application: their brain is in the condition of a lighted taper, expo&s;ed to the air; its flame per|petually wavering: a child a&s;ks a que&s;tion, and before you can an&s;wer, his eyes are upon the wain|&s;cot, counting all the figures painted there; or all the pieces of gla&s;s that compo&s;e the windows. To force him back to his fir&s;t object, is, as it were, to put him in confinement. So then it behoves us with great care to tempori&s;e with the organs till they are grown firm; an&s;wer his que&s;tion di|rectly, and let him a&s;k others as he likes; entertain his curio&s;ity only, and furni&s;h his memory with a &s;tock of good materials. The time will come when they will a&s;&s;emble of them&s;elves, and the brain having obtained a con&s;i&s;tence, the child will rea&s;on of cour&s;e; at which time, when he happens not to rea&s;on ju&s;tly, confine your&s;elf to &s;etting him right, and letting him &s;ee, without emotion, as he &s;hall give you an opportunity, what it is to draw a true con&s;equence. Suffer a child therefore, to have his play, and mingle in&s;truction with it, that wi&s;dom may not &s;hew her&s;elf to him but at intervals, and ever with a &s;miling countenance: take care, I &s;ay, of tiring him with indi&s;crete exactne&s;s:</P>
<P>If a child once forms to him&s;elf a frightful and gloomy idea of virtue, if &s;elf-will and irregularity appear to his eyes in a plea&s;ing &s;hape, all is lo&s;t;
<PB N="555" REF="160">
your endeavours are in vain: therefore keep him ever from the flatteries of the narrow-minded and the profligate. We grow to love the manners and &s;entiments of the per&s;ons we love; the plea&s;ure found for the time in the company of immoral people, draws us on by degrees to e&s;teem tho&s;e very qualities in them which are mo&s;t to be abo|minated.</P>
<P>In order to give children a liking to the well-di&s;po&s;ed, bring them to remark all that in them is both amiable and profitable; their &s;incerity, their mode&s;ty, their di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, fidelity, and di&s;|cretion; but above every thing, their piety, which is the &s;ource of all. Should it happen that any &s;uch have &s;omething about them di&s;agreeable and di&s;gu&s;ting, you may &s;ay, the&s;e defects take not their ri&s;e from Piety; &s;he eradicates, or at lea&s;t a|bates them.</P>
<P>Though you &s;hould keep &s;trict watch over your|&s;elf never to let him &s;ee in you ought but what is right, yet expect not that your defects will e&s;cape him; frequently he will perceive &s;ome of your mi|nute&s;t failings. St. Au&s;tin tells us, that he in his infancy remarked the vanity of his ma&s;ters in their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions. The be&s;t &s;tep you can take, and the mo&s;t important, is, to be as well acquainted with your own defects as will the child, and to get &s;ome &s;incere friends to adverti&s;e you of them. Ge|nerally &s;peaking, tho&s;e who have the government of children, pardon nothing in them, and every thing in them&s;elves; this excites in the young ones a &s;pirit of critici&s;m and ill-nature, in&s;omuch, that when ever they can e&s;pie any fault in the go|vernor,
<PB N="556" REF="161">
they are quite delighted; what they want is, a rea&s;on to hold him in contempt. Avoid this inconvenience, nor fear to &s;peak of your vi&s;ible de|fects, nor of the errors that have e&s;caped you in his pre&s;ence: as you find him capable of hearing rea&s;on, &s;ay that you are de&s;irous to &s;et him an ex|ample of correcting his errors by correcting your own. Thus will you draw from your imperfections them&s;elves matter of in&s;truction and edification for the child, and give him courage to bear correction; thus will you e&s;cape that contempt and di&s;gu&s;t which your failings might give him for your per&s;on.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it is nece&s;&s;ary to take all me|thods to render the things you require of him a|greeable; &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome particular one &s;hould be in its nature unplea&s;ant, a&s;&s;ure him that his trouble will be followed with &s;atisfaction; explain the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of what you would teach him; &s;hew him the relation it bears to the commerce of the world, and the duties of his &s;tation; without this, &s;tudy will appear an ab&s;tract, barren, and thorny piece of work; to what purpo&s;e, will they &s;ay to them&s;elves, is it to learn all the&s;e things which are never men|tioned in conver&s;ation, and have no relation to what one is obliged to do. It is nece&s;&s;ary there|fore to give them the rea&s;on for teaching them: it is, we may &s;ay, to put you in a capacity of doing well, what one day will be your duty. It is to form your judgment; it is to u&s;e you to rea&s;on well upon the affairs of life. One &s;hould always place in their view &s;ome truly u&s;eful and agreeable end, that will keep up the &s;pirit of application;
<PB N="557" REF="162">
but never pretend to force them to it by meer ty|rannical authority.</P>
<P>Never a&s;&s;ume, without extreme nece&s;&s;ity, an au|&s;tere and imperious air, &s;uch as makes children tremble. It is for the mo&s;t part affectation and pe|dantry in governe&s;&s;es; for as to children, they are generally but too meek and ba&s;hful: it is the way to harden their hearts, and to de&s;troy that tru&s;t and reliance, without which no fruit of education is to be expected. Make your&s;elf beloved by them, that they may be free with you, and not fear to let you &s;ee their faults; to bring this about, be in|dulgent to tho&s;e of them who act without di&s;gui&s;e; &s;eem neither a&s;toni&s;hed, nor provoked at their bad inclinations; on the contrary, bear with their weak|ne&s;&s;es: &s;ometimes this inconvenience will ari&s;e, that they will be under le&s;s re&s;traint of fear, yet upon the whole, a reliance and a &s;incerity kept up will be more &s;erviceable to them than your exertion of ri|gorous authority. Authority will at all times take place, when re&s;pect and per&s;ua&s;ion fail; we &s;hould ever begin with an open behaviour, ea&s;y, and fa|miliar without meanne&s;s; this affords an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing their real tempers, and of knowing them thoroughly. In &s;hort, though you &s;hould re|duce them by dint of authority to the ob&s;ervation of all your rules, the whole would be but a &s;cene of &s;tiff formalities, perhaps of hypocri&s;y; you would give them a di&s;gu&s;t to that good, which it ought to be your &s;ole aim to make them love.</P>
<P>If the wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach continually recommends it to parents, ever to keep the rod lifted up over their children; if he hath &s;aid, Play with thy child,
<PB N="558" REF="163">
and he will bring thee to heavine&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fccle&s;ia&s;ticus, Chap. xxx. ver. 9.</NOTE>, it is not that he means to blame a gentle and patient education: he only condemns tho&s;e weak and incon&s;iderate parents who flatter the pa&s;&s;ions of their children, and aim at nothing but to plea&s;e them&s;elves with them, during their infancy, to &s;uch a degree as to indulge them in all kinds of exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion from this is, that parents ought always to keep authority in re&s;erve for correction; for there are di&s;po&s;itions which mu&s;t be &s;ubdued by fear, but, once again, it is not to be made u&s;e of but when we have nothing el&s;e left.</P>
<P>A child, who hitherto acts merely by his imagi|nation, and confounds in his head tho&s;e things that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to him in combination, hates &s;tudy and virtue, whenever he is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an aver&s;ion to the per&s;on that talks to him of them.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve here the &s;ource of that gloomy and frightful idea of piety, which he retains all his life: it is often the only part that &s;tays with him of an education of &s;everity.</P>
<P>Frequently it will behove us to tolerate things that require to be corrected; and to watch for the moment in which the &s;pirit of the child &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to profit by correction. Never reprehend him in his fir&s;t emotion, nor in your own: if you do it during your own, he will perceive you to be actuated by your mood and over-ha&s;tine&s;s, not by rea&s;on or friend&s;hip to him: you will lo&s;e your au|thority without re&s;ource. In ca&s;e you reprove him in his fir&s;t emotion, con&s;ider he has not his &s;pirit enough at liberty to acknowledge his fault, to over|come
<PB N="559" REF="164">
his pa&s;&s;ion, to perceive the importance of your reproof. This is to expo&s;e the child to a lo&s;ing of the re&s;pect which he owes you: let him always &s;ee you ma&s;ter of your&s;elf, and this your patience will be&s;t &s;how him. Watch day after day, if need be, for the favourable moments to introduce reproof. Tell him not of his faults, without adding the method of &s;urmounting them, &s;ome|thing that may hearten him to endeavour it; for we mu&s;t beware of the chagrin and de&s;pondency, which mere dry correction brings on.</P>
<P>If one finds the child &s;omewhat rea&s;onable, I believe it right to engage him in&s;en&s;ibly to de&s;ire to be told of his mi&s;takes, and by this means he will hear them without being afflicted; but even then let him hear but one at a time. It ought to be con&s;idered that children have weak heads, and by rea&s;on of their age, are &s;en&s;ible of plea&s;ure alone; whereas, there is oft times expected of them an ex|actne&s;s and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of which the very people that require it, are not them&s;elves capable; nay, their very temper receives a dangerous tincture of unea&s;ine&s;s and melancholy from being continually talked to of words and things they under&s;tand not: no liberty, no diver&s;ion, but always a le&s;&s;on, &s;ilence, a pre&s;cribed po&s;ture, rebukes, threats. The an|cients under&s;tood this matter much better; among the Hebrews, Egyptians, and Greeks, the principal &s;ciences, the maxims of virtue, and politene&s;s of manners, were introduced by the delightfulne&s;s of ver&s;e and mu&s;ic: people that have not read can hardly believe this, &s;o wide is it from our cu&s;toms; neverthele&s;s, whoever is the lea&s;t acquainted with
<PB N="560" REF="165">
hi&s;tory, can have no doubt of its having been the common practice for &s;everal ages.</P>
<P>In this our age let us accede &s;o far as to unite the agreeable with the u&s;eful, as much as lies in our power.</P>
<P>Now, though with regard to numbers of children who&s;e tempers are difficult to be wrought upon, we cannot hope not to be obliged to make u&s;e of fear, yet we &s;hould fir&s;t have tried, with patience, every other remedy.</P>
<P>We ought to make them apprehend di&s;tinctly the &s;um of what we require of them, the very point which would plea&s;e us; for liveline&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition, and their reliance on us ought to be kept up, otherwi&s;e their &s;pirit will be dulled, and their courage abated; the bold will be provoked, the gentle made &s;tupid. Fear is like tho&s;e forcible remedies made u&s;e of in violent illne&s;&s;es, they purge, but they alter the temperament and wear the organs: and thus, amind acted upon by fear is con&s;tantly rendered weaker.</P>

<HEAD>The TRIFLER. [NUMBER VIII.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF the title of a literary performance contributes much to excite the curi|o&s;ity of the public, I can well &s;uppo&s;e that the Trifler is eagerly peru&s;ed by all the bright eyes of the kingdom; for &s;urely a greater con&s;onancy between the title of this e&s;&s;ay and the pre&s;ent complection of females, cannot well be imagined.&mdash;For to what end or u&s;e do the multiplied branches of female education &s;erve, but to trifle gracefully and agreeably? This is the true <HI>&s;&ccedil;avoir vivre,</HI> &s;o happily and univer&s;ally taught by tho&s;e valuable people, the French governe&s;&s;es, all over this great metropolis: for &s;urely no other
<PB N="562" REF="167">
per&s;ons can pretend, with equal ju&s;tice, to give people of fa&s;hion that charming air and tho&s;e en|chanting manners which alone can make them look like them&s;elves. Did our young gentlemen enjoy the benefit of in&s;truction equally &s;alubrious, I &s;hould hope, that in a little time they might learn to trifle away their courage and hone&s;ty, almo&s;t as happily as the French them&s;elves &s;eem to have done.</P>
<P>Nor let it derogate in the lea&s;t from the pre&s;ent approved &s;y&s;tem of things, that in the fervid pur|&s;uit of higher attainments, the ladies may very po&s;&s;ibly le&s;s attend to duty, character, reputation, than &s;ome Cynical per&s;ons have been willing to ap|prove of. Surely &s;uch mean in&s;inuations could only be &s;ugge&s;ted by tho&s;e who&s;e exploded non&s;en&s;e has totally di&s;qualified them for the &s;ociety of the tri|flers&mdash;And really was the accu&s;ation well founded, I don't &s;ee what blame could ju&s;tly lie upon us, who have never been taught to &s;et the lea&s;t value on moral obligations.</P>
<P>In how much more plea&s;ing a light have we been in&s;tructed to con&s;ider the &s;cope and de&s;ign of our being? We have at length happily re&s;olved it into one general principle, that of being <HI>delightfully idle.</HI></P>
<P>In order to &s;upport the con&s;i&s;tency of our cha|racter, give me leave to de&s;cend to a few particulars. If a lady &s;pends her whole life in fretful di&s;&s;ipation, is it not plain, that &s;he con&s;iders her time, for the u&s;e of which &s;ome have fancied them&s;elves ac|countable, as a meer trifle?</P>
<P><PB N="563" REF="168">If another con&s;iders cards as the true con&s;olation of life, and con&s;equently makes them the &s;ole bu|&s;ine&s;s of it, &s;uppo&s;ing even that &s;he is un&s;ucce&s;sful, no matter by what compen&s;ations &s;he ballances her accounts; her lo&s;&s;es <HI>in any way,</HI> can only be con&s;idered as meer trifles.</P>
<P>If a third, by the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign tui|tion, has been happily extricated from the re&s;traints of mode&s;ty, delicacy, virtue, and religion, the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions ought &s;urely to be con&s;idered as &s;o many negative advantages, and their value placed to our account. For it is well known, that tho&s;e explod|ed qualities which are now not worth a di&s;pute, were only held in great reverence in remarkably <HI>&s;imple times.</HI></P>
<P>However, we are happily accompli&s;hed out of all tho&s;e &s;implicities, and have &s;ub&s;tituted in their room &s;uch opinions as have rai&s;ed us above all vulgar fears and prejudices&mdash;Hence it is, that we have left the &s;en&s;e and love of religion to be embraced only by tho&s;e who are no longer loved by any body. Let &s;uch as want the &s;olid &s;upports of fa&s;hion, lux|ury, gallantry, and fifty et cetera's, take refuge in &s;uch aerial meditations: for our part, we &s;hall take care to enjoy the &s;ub&s;tance, and leave to tho&s;e di&s;appointed wretches the &s;hadow.</P>
<P>As to the churches, I can't &s;ay what &s;ort of peo|ple attend them, as neither I or any of my ac|quaintance ever go there; but, in the way of cu|rio&s;ity and plea&s;ure, we &s;ometimes vi&s;it the me|thodi&s;t conventicles; and there thro' the whole au|ditory there obtains &s;o vi&s;ible a di&s;traction, that we have always con&s;idered tho&s;e deluded people
<PB N="564" REF="169">
as much more the objects of compa&s;&s;ion than contempt.</P>
<P>I have often thought it extremely well judged in the government to tolerate &s;uch places; for they mu&s;t con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en the number of mad-hou&s;es. With &s;uch invariable con&s;tancy do we per&s;evere in our opinions, that our whole life may be con&s;idered as one uniform trifle; and, unle&s;s we &s;hould be encumbered by a few brats, can it be &s;aid of any of us, when we quit the &s;cene, that we have left any monuments of our exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>A tender regard for the honor, laws, and re|ligion of one's country, are considerations which only can affect narrow &s;ouls; but (thanks to the dear foreigners who direct our education) we have been taught to con&s;ider things in a more elevated &s;en&s;e, and to re&s;pect the intere&s;t of our very na|tional enemies at lea&s;t as much as our own, and univer&s;ally to prefer tho&s;e people to our own na|tives.</P>
<P>There is one di&s;covery in particular that does infinite honour to our &s;ociety, and which for the credit of the &s;i&s;terhood, I mu&s;t beg leave a little to enlarge upon&mdash;I mean our di&s;covery of the true &s;ources of plea&s;ure and happine&s;s. The&s;e objects were heretofore &s;uppo&s;ed to be be&s;t attained by <HI>following nature,</HI> and to be in&s;eparably connected with rea&s;on and duty. Plea&s;ure, truly &s;o called, had formerly been con&s;idered as a very <HI>natural thing,</HI> and &s;ome unintelligible &s;tuff, named vir|tue, as the only &s;afe road to happine&s;s&mdash;But we have undeceived the world in the&s;e particulars, and have taught them to look for their happine&s;s
<PB N="565" REF="170">
where none but our&s;elves ever dreamed it could be found.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we have fixed its ba&s;is in the extinc|tion of all rea&s;onable ideas, and, to enjoy life the more perfectly, have fairly con&s;ented to lo&s;e &s;ight of all the ends of living. This grand principle pervades the whole &s;phere of our activity, and our conduct affords the mo&s;t ample atte&s;tation of our opinions.&mdash;Let others, if they plea&s;e, look up to cau&s;es, and con&s;ider con&s;equences; it is &s;ufficient for us, that we appear of con&s;equence in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>Nor are we in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted by the invi|dious remarks of tho&s;e who would in&s;inuate, that we are not quite &s;o happy as we would &s;eem to be; and that, notwith&s;tanding our continual ef|forts to appear highly plea&s;ed, there is &s;till a di&s;|mal vacuity in our minds.</P>
<P>However that may be, there is at lea&s;t an equal vacuity in tho&s;e under&s;tandings who have made that remark, not to know, that we live only for appearances; and that to be, or to &s;eem only, are pretty much the &s;ame thing with the whole race of triflers.</P>
<P>Nay, to a &s;till higher heroi&s;m have we carried our ideas on this &s;ubject, that, with a magnanimity peculiar to our&s;elves, we have exchanged realities for appearances, and have lo&s;t all plea&s;ure, <HI>merely for plea&s;ure's &s;ake.</HI> Let others ridiculou&s;ly e&s;timate their happine&s;s by their own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, while we wi&s;ely mea&s;ure ours by the opinions of other people, which mu&s;t always be in our favour &s;o long as</P>
<P><HI>to appear we &s;trive,</HI></P>
<P><HI>The mo&s;t contented things alive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="171">I can't conclude this letter, without lamenting the great detriment our &s;ociety have &s;uffered by the conduct of Miranda. This lady, you know, is the &s;worn enemy of all triflers, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of her whole life has been to di&s;credit our opinions. Per|ver&s;e creature! not to have yielded to the convic|tion which <HI>numbers, fa&s;hion,</HI> and <HI>raillery</HI> &s;carcely ever fail to impre&s;s.</P>
<P>Her ob&s;tinacy is the more to be lamented, as from an <HI>unu&s;ual</HI> concurrence of circum&s;tances her influence happens to be very exten&s;ive. Happy for us there are few Miranda's; for if we may judge from this one, half a dozen &s;uch would be &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the credit of our &s;ociety. Never was there &s;o ungrateful a creature! would you believe it? though nature has been extremely kind to her, in the di&s;tribution of per&s;onal charms, &s;he never was &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected to be &s;en&s;ible of the obligation. It is very plain that this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e; for had &s;he been duly thankful for nature's liberality, &s;he would, like the re&s;t of us, have &s;olely relied upon it, and never &s;o far affront|ed her beauty, as to endeavour to plea&s;e by any other merit what&s;oever.</P>
<P>We have great rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that nature in this in&s;tance had &s;pared her bounty; for her charms always create an attention, which &s;he never fails to improve to our prejudice. However, there is one con&s;olation left; as Miranda is yet &s;ingle, and the men almo&s;t all of our party, who knows but the race may become extinct?</P>
<P>This lady, I am told, among other &s;ingularities, pretends to have opinions of her own; and that
<PB N="567" REF="172">
&s;he makes rea&s;on, and not ridicule, the criterion by which &s;he examines their truth. Some of her notions are &s;o extraordinary as to de&s;erve being related. She thinks that moral virtue, on its true ba&s;is religion, is the only &s;ure and permanent ob|ject of e&s;teem; and that whatever purifies the heart does likewi&s;e embelli&s;h the manners, and even rai&s;es the genius. She cannot comprehend why a rational creature &s;hould be a&s;hamed of its rea&s;on, or blu&s;h to acknowledge a plea&s;ure in cultivating it.</P>
<P>She is of opinion that a woman of &s;en&s;e is a cha|racter not inferior to a woman of fa&s;hion, and, with an extravagant ambition, has united both in her own per&s;on. I have here only given you a &s;mall &s;pecimen of her notions, which are &s;uch, you &s;ee, as leave us &s;lender hopes of reclaiming her.</P>
<P>Indeed were her opinions &s;imply propo&s;ed to the under&s;tanding, <HI>or to the de&s;ires,</HI> which judge much better, they are &s;o repugnant to the pre&s;ent modes both of thinking and acting, that they mu&s;t be inevitably rejected, as our cu&s;tom is, without any examination at all. But things will appear very different, &s;een through different mediums. There are certain women who carry in their own per&s;ons a demon&s;tration of their opinions. Of that num|ber is Miranda, who be&s;ides has got &s;uch a way of <HI>colouring</HI> things, and of recommending her no|tions by manners the mo&s;t in&s;inuating, and a be|haviour &s;o &s;weetly feminine, that I really begin to fear her impre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. You know, my dear, every body is not fortified as we are, and the girl has &s;o impo&s;ing a way, &s;he cer|tainly will continue to do much mi&s;chief. Let us

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Herbert returned from his walk, and met the curate, and his little family at &s;upper, Sophia, who heedfully ob&s;erved him, &s;aw an alteration in his countenance, which realized all her melancholy apprehen&s;ions, and convinced her that &s;ome new misfortune awaited her: his eyes, which &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided her's, ex|pre&s;&s;ed nothing but grief and confu&s;ion; but he retired &s;o early to his chamber, that Sophia, finding there was no hopes of his explaining him&s;elf that night, pa&s;&s;ed it in an anxiety of mind which &s;uffered her not to ta&s;te the lea&s;t repo&s;e. Early in the morning he knocked at her door, and de&s;ired her to join him in the garden; &s;he was already dre&s;t, and in&s;tantly complied.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he came up to him, he took her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately, but &s;poke not a word.</P>
<P>Sophia, who feared, as much as &s;he wi&s;hed to know what had happened, had not power to a&s;k for an explanation; &s;o they both continued &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>At length Mr. Herbert told her he was going to London: Sophia, in a faultering accent, a&s;ked
<PB N="570" REF="175">
him what had happened to occa&s;ion this &s;udden re&s;olution?</P>
<P><Q>Alas! my dear child, &s;aid the good old man, in great emotion, I am a&s;hamed and grieved to tell you that &mdash;Sir Charles has, I fear, de|ceived me.</Q></P>
<P>Although Sophia had rea&s;on to expect &s;ome &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, and had endeavoured to prepare her&s;elf for it, yet this fatal confirmation of her fears &s;hocked her &s;o much, that Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw a death-like palene&s;s over&s;pread her face, and felt her hand cold and trembling, fearing &s;he would faint, made ha&s;te to lead her to a little bench of turf which was near them.</P>
<P>Sophia recovering, &s;aw &s;o much concern in his looks, that &s;truggling to repre&s;s her own angui&s;h, &s;he endeavoured to comfort him, and &s;miling through the tears that filled her charming eyes,
<Q>Let not this in&s;tance of my weakne&s;s alarm you, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he; and doubt not but, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of heaven, I &s;hall bear this &s;trange in&s;ult with proper fortitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How worthy are you, my good child, of bet|ter fortune!</Q>
&s;aid Mr. Herbert; then taking a letter out of his pocket,
<Q>My fir&s;t de&s;ign, pur&s;ued he, was to &s;eek &s;ome explanation of this my&s;te|rious letter before I made you acquainted with it, but I perceived that my too apparent unea&s;ine&s;s had alarmed you, and I thought it would be le&s;s cruel to inform you of the whole matter, than to leave you in doubt and uncertainty: this let|ter was delivered to me ye&s;terday in the evening, by one of Sir Charles's &s;ervants, ju&s;t as was
<PB N="571" REF="176">
walking out towards the road, in hopes of meet|ing his ma&s;ter. My &s;urpri&s;e at receiving a letter when I expected to &s;ee him&s;elf, made me open it in&s;tantly, without a&s;king the &s;ervant any que|&s;tions, and while I was reading it he went away, doubtle&s;s being directed to do &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert then gave the letter to Sophia, who unfolding it with trembling emotion, found it was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since it is impo&s;&s;ible my marriage with Mi&s;s Sophia can ever take place, I wi&s;h you would look upon all that pa&s;&s;ed between us upon that &s;ubject, as a dream: I dreamt indeed when I imagined there was a woman in the world capable of a &s;incere attachment; and I ought to be a&s;hamed to own that upon &s;o delu&s;ive a hope I was ready to act in oppo&s;ition to the general max|ims of the world, and be pointed at as a &s;illy ro|mantic fellow. However, I beg you will a&s;&s;ure the lady, that as I have no right to blame her con|duct, &s;o I have not the lea&s;t re&s;entment for it, and am &s;o perfectly at ea&s;e on this occa&s;ion, that I can with great &s;incerity congratulate her on her ap|proaching happine&s;s. I am, Sir,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Although this letter gave Sophia a &s;ad certainty of her misfortune, yet it relieved her from tho&s;e wor&s;t pangs which a heart in love can feel, the be|lief of being abandoned through indifference, or incon&s;tancy: unperceived by our&s;elves, pride mixes
<PB N="572" REF="177">
with our mo&s;t tender affections, and either aggra|vates or le&s;&s;ens the &s;en&s;e of every di&s;appointment, in proportion as we feel our&s;elves humbled by the circum&s;tances that attend it.</P>
<P>This ill-di&s;gui&s;ed jealou&s;y, the per&s;onated calm|ne&s;s, the &s;truggling re&s;entment that appeared in this letter, convinced Sophia that Sir Charles was far from being at ea&s;e, and that to whatever cau&s;e his pre&s;ent unaccountable behaviour was owing, yet &s;he was &s;ure at lea&s;t of not being indifferent to him.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to perceive that he had been deceived by &s;ome malicious reports, and her &s;u&s;|picions fell immediately upon Harriot; but reject|ing this thought, as too injurious to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he returned the letter to Mr. Herbert without &s;peaking a word, but with a look much more &s;erene and compo&s;ed than before.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw nothing in this letter like what her penetration had di&s;covered, and who conceived it to be only a poor artifice to di&s;engage him&s;elf from promi&s;es which he now repented of, was &s;urpri&s;ed to find her &s;o much le&s;s affected with it than he expected, and a&s;ked her what &s;he thought of it?</P>
<P>Sophia told him, that &s;he was fully per&s;uaded Sir Charles had been prejudiced again&s;t her.</P>
<P><Q>Do you think &s;o, my dear, &s;aid he, after a little pau&s;e; then it is your &s;i&s;ter to whom you are obliged for this kind office.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope not, &s;ir, replied Sophia, &s;ighing; that circum&s;tance would aggravate my concern&mdash;in|deed
<PB N="573" REF="178">
I think it would be a crime in me to &s;u&s;|pect her of being capable of &s;uch unkindne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, re&s;umed Mr. Herbert, I will, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;cover this my&s;tery before night; you &s;hall hear from me to-morrow; in the mean time calm your mind, and re&s;ign your&s;elf entirely to that providence, which while you continue thus good and virtuous, will never for&s;ake you.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Herbert now left her, to go and take leave of the curate and his family; and Sophia, who&s;e fortune had undergone &s;o many revolutions in &s;o &s;hort a time, retired to her chamber, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed great part of the day alone, at once to indulge her melancholy and to conceal it from ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Dolly came up, in a great hurry of &s;pirits, to acquaint her that Mrs. Gibbons was come to wait upon her, that &s;he had been met at the door by her mother, and that &s;everal courte&s;ies had pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>The poor girl, though tran&s;ported with joy at this favourable beginning, no &s;ooner perceived by the pen&s;ive air in Sophia's countenance, and the &s;ighs that e&s;caped her, that her &s;u&s;picions of &s;ome new di&s;appointment having happened to her were true, than in&s;tantly forgetting the pro&s;perous &s;itu|ation of her own affairs, her &s;weet face was over|&s;pread with tender grief, and a tear &s;tole from her eyes; but Sophia, whom nothing could have a|wakened from that &s;tupifying &s;orrow in which any great and &s;udden misfortune plunges the mind, but the de&s;ire of being u&s;eful to her friends, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a more chearful look, and ha&s;tened to re|ceive her vi&s;itor.</P>
<P><PB N="574" REF="179">Mrs. Gibbons was in full dre&s;s, and had omit|ted no &s;uperfluous ornament that could &s;erve to &s;hew Sophia how well &s;he under&s;tood every &s;ort of punctilio. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t compliments were over,
<Q>You &s;ee, madam, &s;aid &s;he, what <HI>affluence</HI> your commands have over me; I once little thought that I &s;hould ever have entered this im|poli&s;hed hou&s;e again; my nephew attended me to the door, but I would not &s;uffer him to come in, becau&s;e I am not &s;ure that you are willing to let the&s;e people know the honour you do him by receiving his adorations.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, though a little &s;tartled at the&s;e words, yet &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had no particular meaning in them, and a&s;cribed all to her fanta&s;tick manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf; but Mrs. Gibbons being re&s;olved to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of an affair which &s;he had very much at heart, &s;poke &s;o intelligibly at la&s;t, that Sophia could no longer be ignorant of her de|&s;ign, all the ill con&s;equences of which &s;uddenly &s;triking her imagination, &s;he exclaimed in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e and terror,
<Q>Sure I am the mo&s;t un|fortunate creature in the world! is it po&s;&s;ible, Mrs. Gibbons, that you can be &s;erious? have you really given any cau&s;e for a report, that I receive your nephew's addre&s;&s;es? if you have, you have done me an irreparable injury.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia's &s;pirits were &s;o greatly agitated that &s;he did not perceive how much of her &s;ituation the&s;e words di&s;covered; &s;o that Mrs. Gibbons, who &s;aw the tears flow fa&s;t from her eyes, immediately com|prehended the whole truth.</P>
<P><PB N="575" REF="180">
<Q>I &s;ee plainly, &s;aid &s;he, in great concern, that I have been deceived, and others perhaps have been &s;o too; I &s;hall never <HI>di&s;culpate</HI> my&s;elf for being the cau&s;e of any misfortune to you: &s;ome more advantageous <HI>treati&s;e</HI> has been on the <HI>tape&s;try,</HI> and this unlucky affair has done mi&s;|chief.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Give me leave to a&s;k you, madam, interupted Sophia, with &s;ome peevi&s;hne&s;s, what foundation you had for believing that I con&s;idered your nephew as my lover? you know his heart has been long &s;ince engaged.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I acknowledge I have been to blame, my dear mi&s;s, re&s;umed Mrs. Gibbons, I was too <HI>&s;an|guinary</HI> in my hopes; but I beg you will <HI>di&s;claim</HI> no more, this will do no good, only tell me if it is po&s;&s;ible to repair the harm I have done by my fooli&s;h &s;chemes.</Q></P>
<P>To this Sophia made no an&s;wer; but Mrs. Gib|bons, who wanted neither tenderne&s;s nor candor, and who was greatly concerned at the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;aw her under, urged her &s;o frequently, and with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, to tell her if &s;he could be of any u&s;e in clearing up a mi&s;take that had po&s;&s;ibly been di&s;advantageous to her, that Sophia, &s;till attentive amid&s;t all her own di&s;tre&s;&s;es to the intere&s;t of her friend, thought this a favourable opportunity to &s;erve her; and therefore told Mrs. Gibbons, that if &s;he was really &s;incere in her offers, there was one way.</P>
<P><Q>I under&s;tand you, madam, interrupted Mrs. Gibbons, and I believe I may venture to &s;ay that I thought of this <HI>expedition</HI> before you did. I
<PB N="576" REF="181">
cannot, indeed, Mi&s;s Darnley, I cannot con&s;ent to my nephew's marriage with the young woman here; you know I have been affronted.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia now urged &s;ome arguments in favour of Mrs. Law&s;on, but chiefly re&s;ted her defence upon her ignorance of tho&s;e form's of politene&s;s and good breeding which Mrs. Gibbons was &s;o perfectly mi|&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>This compliment put the old lady into &s;o good a humour, that &s;he cried out,
<Q>Well, my dear Mi&s;s Darnley, in regard to you, I will take off the <HI>probition</HI> I laid on my nephew to vi&s;it here no more; and this I hope, added &s;he &s;miling, will &s;et matters right in another place; as for the re&s;t, I &s;hall take no re&s;olution till I &s;ee how they behave.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, in her tran&s;port at having &s;ucceeded &s;o well with the old lady, felt all her own griefs &s;u&s;|pended; and indeed when &s;he reflected upon what had happened with regard to her&s;elf, &s;he found &s;he had le&s;s cau&s;e for reflection than Mr. Herbert, or her own fears, had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons acknowledged that &s;he had flat|tered her&s;elf with the hope of her nephew's being well received by her; and that, in con&s;equence of it, &s;he had talked of their marriage as an event which was very likely to happen, and which would give her great joy. Sophia, being fully per&s;uaded that the&s;e reports had reached Sir Charles, though by what means &s;he was not &s;o well able to determine, ea&s;ily accounted for that jealou&s;y and re&s;entment which had produced &s;o &s;trange an incon&s;i&s;tency in his behaviour, and which Mr. Herbert con&s;idered as a piece of artifice to palliate his lightne&s;s and in|con&s;tancy.</P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="182">The good old man, animated by his affection for the poor afflicted Sophia, rode with the utmo&s;t &s;peed to town, and alighted at the hou&s;e of the young baronet. The &s;ervants informed him, that their ma&s;ter was in the country, which was all the intelligence they could give him; for they neither knew where he was, nor when he would return. Mr. Herbert, perplexed and concerned at this new di&s;appointment, repaired immediately to Mrs. Darnley's, hoping to hear &s;ome news of him there.</P>
<P>Harriot, in an&s;wer to his enquiries, told him with an air of triumph, that the &s;ame day they re|turned from vi&s;iting Sophia, Sir Charles had waited on her mamma and her, and had as u&s;ual pa&s;t great part of the afternoon with them.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who was &s;truck with this incident, endeavoured to make &s;ome di&s;coveries concerning their conver&s;ation, and Harriot's malice made this no difficult matter: for &s;he could not forbear throwing out &s;ome &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e extreme &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he in&s;inuated, had already found out a new object.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, by his artful que&s;tions, drew her into a confe&s;&s;ion of all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and the baronet upon this &s;ubject; and was con|vinced that her malignant hints had poi&s;oned his mind with &s;u&s;picions unfavourable to Sophia.</P>
<P>He went away full of indignation at her trea|chery, and &s;till doubtful of Sir Charles's &s;incerity, who he could not &s;uppo&s;e would have been &s;o ea&s;ily influenced by Harriot's &s;ugge&s;tions, (who&s;e envious di&s;po&s;ition he well knew,) if his intentions had been ab&s;olutely right.</P>
<P><PB N="578" REF="183">The next morning he received a letter from Sophia, in which &s;he acquainted him with the di&s;|coveries &s;he had made; and mode&s;tly hinted her belief that Sir Charles had been impo&s;ed upon by this report of her intended marriage, which &s;he found was &s;pread through the village, and which, as it was very probable, he had intelligence from thence, had confirmed any idle raillery to that pur|po&s;e, which her &s;i&s;ter might have indulged her|&s;elf in.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert reflecting upon all the&s;e unlucky circum&s;tances, began to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that Sir Charles had been really deceived. He went a|gain to his hou&s;e, but had the mortification to hear from a &s;ervant whom he had not &s;een the day before, that the baronet was at his &s;eat in&mdash;</P>
<P>Thither the good old man re&s;olved to go; the inconveniencies and expence of &s;uch a journey, which in his years, and narrow circum&s;tances were not incon&s;iderable, had not weight enough with him to make him balance a moment whether he &s;hould tran&s;act this affair by letter, or in per&s;on. The happine&s;s of his dear and amiable charge de|pended upon his &s;ucce&s;s: he therefore delayed no longer than to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for his journey, and, after writing to Sophia to ac|quaint her with his de&s;ign, he &s;et out for Sir Charles's &s;eat, where he met with a new and more &s;evere di&s;appointment. The fir&s;t news he heard was, that the baronet was not in that part of the country; and, upon a fuller enquiry of his &s;ervants, he was informed that their ma&s;ter had the morning before &s;et out for Dover with an intention to go to Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="579" REF="184">Mr. Herbert, di&s;pirited with this news, and fa|tigued with his fruitle&s;s journey, retired to his inn, where he pa&s;&s;ed the lonely hours in melancholy reflections upon the capricious behaviour of Sir Charles, and the unde&s;erved di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the inno|cent Sophia.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, however, notwith&s;tanding appear|ances, was at pre&s;ent more unhappy than guilty. His re&s;olution to marry Sophia, though &s;uddenly formed, was not the le&s;s &s;incere: he had always loved her with the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion, and had not the light character of her mother and &s;i&s;ter con|curred with tho&s;e prejudices which his youth, his fortune, and his conver&s;e with the gay world led him into, his heart, which never cea&s;ed to do homage to her virtue, would have &s;ooner &s;ugge&s;ted to him the only means of being truly happy.</P>
<P>An over&s;trained delicacy likewi&s;e proved another &s;ource of di&s;quietude to him. The inequality of their circum&s;tances gave ri&s;e to a thou&s;and tor|menting doubts: he was afraid, that dazzled with the &s;plendor of his fortune, &s;he would &s;acrifice her inclinations to her intere&s;t, and give him her hand without her heart; and when doing ju&s;tice to the greatne&s;s of her mind, and the real delicacy of her &s;entiments, he rejected this &s;uppo&s;ition as too inju|rious to her, his bu&s;y imagination conjured up new forms of di&s;tru&s;t: he trembled left, mistaking gratitude for love, &s;he &s;hould be deceived by her own genero&s;ity and nice &s;en&s;e of obligation, and imagine it was the lover &s;he prefered, when the benefactor only touched her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="580" REF="185">Such was the perplexed &s;tate of his mind, when Mrs. Darnley and Harriot propo&s;ed making her a vi&s;it. With &s;ome difficulty he conquered his de|&s;ire of accompanying them; but his impatience to hear of her, carried him again to Mrs. Darnley's much earlier in the evening than it was likely they would return; pre&s;uming on his intimacy in the family, he &s;crupled not to go up &s;tairs, telling the &s;ervant he would wait till the ladies came home.</P>
<P>He &s;at down in the dining room, where he gazed on Sophia's picture a long time. At la&s;t a &s;udden fancy &s;eized him to vi&s;it her apartment, which he knew was on the &s;econd floor: he a&s;cended the &s;tairs without being perceived, and with a tender emotion entered the room where his beloved So|phia u&s;ed to pa&s;s &s;o many of her retired hours.</P>
<P>It was &s;till elegantly neat, as when its lovely in|mate was there; for Harriot, who hated this room, becau&s;e it contained &s;o many monuments of her &s;i&s;ter's ta&s;te and indu&s;try, never went into it; and it remained in the &s;ame order that &s;he had left it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that drew the young baronet's attention, was a fire &s;creen of excellent workman|ship; it was a flower-piece, and executed with pe|culiar ta&s;te and propriety: the wain&s;cot was a|dorned with &s;everal drawings, neatly framed and gla&s;&s;ed. In this art Sophia took great delight, having while her father lived, appropriated all her pocket-money to the payment of a ma&s;ter to in|&s;truct her in it. Sir Charles con&s;idered the &s;ubjects of the&s;e drawings with peculiar plea&s;ure. The deli|cate pencil of Sophia had here repre&s;ented the
<PB N="581" REF="186">
virtues and the graces, from tho&s;e lively ideas which exi&s;ted in her own charming mind.</P>
<P>Her little library next engaged his notice: many of the books that compo&s;ed it he had pre&s;ented her; but he was curious to &s;ee tho&s;e which her own choice had directed her to, and in this exami|nation he met with many proofs of her piety as well as of the excellence of her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Several compo&s;itions of her own now fell into his hands; he read them with eagerne&s;s, and, charm|ed with this di&s;covery of tho&s;e trea&s;ures of wit, which &s;he with mode&s;t diffidence &s;o carefully con|cealed, he felt his admiration and tenderne&s;s for her encrea&s;e every moment.</P>
<P>While he was anxiou&s;ly &s;earching for more of her papers, a little &s;hagreen ca&s;e fell from one of the &s;helves upon the ground. He took it up, and as every thing that belonged to her excited his curio&s;ity, he opened it immediately, and with equal &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;aw his own miniature in water colours, which was evidently the performance of Sophia her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had it been po&s;&s;ible for her to imagine the &s;udden and powerful effect the &s;ight of this picture would have upon the heart of Sir Charles, &s;he would not have &s;uffered &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s for the lo&s;s of it as &s;he really had; for forgetting where &s;he had laid it, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it had dropt out of her pocket, and was apprehen&s;ive of its having fallen into her &s;i&s;ter's hands, who &s;he knew would not fail to turn this incident to her di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>While Sir Charles gazed upon this artle&s;s te&s;ti|mony of Sophia's affection for him, the &s;ofte&s;t gra|titude,
<PB N="582" REF="187">
the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion filled his &s;oul.
<Q>Oh my Sophia, &s;aid he, do you then truly love me! and have I cruelly trifled with your tender|ne&s;s!</Q></P>
<P>This thought melted him even to tears; he felt in him&s;elf a dete&s;tation of tho&s;e depraved principles which had &s;ugge&s;ted to him a de&s;ign of deba&s;ing &s;uch purity! he wondered at the hardne&s;s of his own heart, that could &s;o long re&s;i&s;t the influence of her gentle virtues, and &s;uffer &s;uch &s;weet &s;en&s;i|bility to wa&s;te it&s;elf in anxious doubts, and di&s;ap|pointed hope.</P>
<P>Being now determined to do ju&s;tice to her merit, and make him&s;elf happy, his fir&s;t de&s;ign was to go immediately to Mr. Law&s;on's; but, reflecting that Sophia had great rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct, and that to remove her preju|dices, the utmo&s;t caution and delicacy was to be ob&s;erved, he conceived it would be more proper to make a direct application to Mr. Herbert, whom &s;he loved and reverenced as a father, than to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before her, while her mind yet la|boured with tho&s;e unfavourable &s;u&s;picions for which he had given but too much cau&s;e; and hence new fears and doubts aro&s;e to torment him. He dreaded left her ju&s;t re&s;entment for his injurious de&s;igns &s;hould have weakened tho&s;e tender impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had once received, and that in the pride of offended virtue every &s;ofter &s;entiment would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Impatient of this cruel &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and in|quietude, he left Sophia's apartment, and repairing to the dining-room, rang the bell for the &s;ervant, of whom he enquired where Mr. Herbert lodged.
<PB N="583" REF="188">
Having obtained a direction, he went immediately to the hou&s;e; Mr. Herbert was not at home, and Sir Charles grieved at this di&s;appointment, and at Mrs. Darnley's not returning that night, from whom he hoped to have heard &s;ome news of Sophia; the agitation of his mind made him think it an age till the next day, in which he determined to put an end to all his perplexities, and to fix his fate.</P>
<P>After his interview with Mr. Herbert, and the good old man's departure to prepare Sophia for his intended vi&s;it, the young baronet re&s;igned his whole &s;oul to tenderne&s;s and joy. His impatience to &s;ee Sophia encrea&s;ed with his hope of finding her &s;en|timents for him unchanged, and he regretted a thou&s;and times his having &s;uffered Mr. Herbert to go away without him.</P>
<P>Mean time a card came from Mrs. Darnley and Harriot, acquainting him that they were returned, and thanking him for the u&s;e of his &s;ervants and chariot. Sir Charles, eager to hear news of his So|phia, went immediately to wait on them, and &s;carce were the fir&s;t compliments over, when he enquired for her with &s;uch apparent emotion, that, Harriot mortified to the la&s;t degree, re&s;olved to be even with him, and &s;aid every thing that &s;he thought would torment him, and prejudice her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>She told him that Sophia was the mo&s;t contented creature in the world, and that &s;he was &s;o charmed with her pre&s;ent way of life, and her new compa|nions, that &s;he &s;eemed to have forgot all her old friends, and even her relations.
<Q>She is grown a meer country girl, &s;aid &s;he, is always wandering about in the fields and meadows, followed by a
<PB N="584" REF="189">
young ru&s;tic who has fallen in love with her. I rallied her a little upon her ta&s;te; but I found &s;he could not bear it, and indeed he is extremely hand&s;ome, and &s;he &s;ays, has had a genteel edu|cation.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot was at once plea&s;ed and grieved at ob|&s;erving the effect the&s;e in&s;inuations had on Sir Charles; his colour changed, he trembled, and fixing his eyes on the ground, he remained pen&s;ive and &s;ilent, while Harriot, notwith&s;tanding her mo|ther's &s;ignificant frowns, proceeded in a malicious detail of little circum&s;tances partly invented, and partly mi&s;taken, which fixed the &s;harpe&s;t &s;tings of jealou&s;y in his heart.</P>
<P>If in dealing with cunning per&s;ons we were al|ways to con&s;ider their ends, in order to interpret their &s;peeches, much of their artifice would lo&s;e its effect; but Sir Charles had &s;o contemptible an opi|nion of Harriot's under&s;tanding, that although he knew &s;he was malicious, he never &s;u&s;pected her of being capable of laying &s;chemes to gratify her ma|lice, and did not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of inven|tion enough to form &s;o plau&s;ible a tale as that &s;he had told.</P>
<P>Impatient under tho&s;e cruel doubts which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, he re&s;olved to go, late as it was in the evening, to Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, and taking an abrupt leave of Mrs. Darnley and her daughter, he went home, and ordered his hor&s;es to be got ready. He &s;carce knew his own de&s;ign by taking this journey at &s;o improper a time; but in the ex|treme agitation of his mind, the fir&s;t idea of relief that naturally pre&s;ented it&s;elf was to &s;ee Sophia,
<PB N="585" REF="190">
who alone could de&s;troy or confirm his fears; and this he eagerly pur&s;ued without any farther re|flection.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant to whom he had &s;ent his orders, made no ha&s;te to execute them, as conceiving it to be a mo&s;t extravagant whim in his ma&s;ter to &s;et out upon a journey &s;o late, and in that manner. While he with &s;tudied delays protracted the time, hoping for &s;ome change in his re&s;olutions, Sir Charles racked with impatience, counted moments for hours; me&s;&s;age after me&s;&s;age was di&s;patched to the groom. The hor&s;es at length were brought, and Sir Charles with only one &s;ervant gallop'd away, never &s;topping till he came to the place where Sophia re&s;ided.</P>
<P>It was now night, and the indecorum of making a vi&s;it at &s;uch a time in a family where he was a &s;tranger fir&s;t &s;triking his thoughts, he re&s;olved to alight at an inn which he &s;aw at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and there con&s;ider what it was be&s;t for him to do.</P>
<P>A gue&s;t of his appearance &s;oon engaged the at|tention of the ho&s;t and his wife. They quitted two men with whom they had then been talking, and, with a great deal of officious civility, attended upon Sir Charles, who de&s;ired to be &s;hewn into a room. As he was following the good woman, who declared he &s;hould have the be&s;t in her hou&s;e, the two men with whom &s;he had been talking, bowed to him when he pa&s;&s;ed by them; the &s;alute of the younger having a certain grace in it that drew his attention, he looked back on him, and at the &s;ight of a very hand&s;ome face, and a per&s;on uncommon|ly
<PB N="586" REF="191">
genteel, his heart, by its throbbing emotion, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that this beautiful youth was the lover of his Sophia.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y which Harriot's in&s;inuations had kindled in his heart, now raged with redoubled force; this rival, whom &s;he had called a ru&s;tic, and whom he fondly hoped to find &s;uch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t attractive graces of form, and probably wanted neither wit nor politene&s;s. Sophia's youth, her tenderne&s;s, her &s;en&s;ibility wounded by his di&s;&s;em|bled indifference, and the cruel capriciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct, all di&s;po&s;ed her to receive a new im|pre&s;&s;ion, and who &s;o proper to touch her heart as this lovely youth, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, as innocent as it was ardent and &s;incere, bani&s;hed all doubt and &s;u&s;|picion, and left her whole &s;oul open to the &s;oft pleadings of gratitude and love?</P>
<P>While he was wholly ab&s;orb'd in the&s;e torment|ing reflections, and incapable of taking any re&s;olu|tion, the officious landlady entered his chamber to take his orders for &s;upper.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, &s;urpri&s;ed to find it was &s;o late, re|&s;olved to &s;tay there all night, and after giving the good woman &s;ome directions, his re&s;tle&s;s curio&s;ity impelled him to a&s;k her &s;everal que&s;tions concern|ing the old man and the youth whom he had &s;een talking to her.</P>
<P>The ho&s;te&s;s, who was as communicative as he could de&s;ire, told him, that the old man was one farmer Gibbons, of whom &s;he had been buying a load of hay; that the young one was his &s;on, and a great &s;cholard.
<Q>His aunt, pur&s;ued &s;he, breeds
<PB N="587" REF="192">
him up to be a gentleman, and &s;he has a power of money, and de&s;igns to leave it all to him, much good may it do him, for he is as hand&s;ome a young man as one would de&s;ire to &s;ee. Some time ago it was all over our town that he was going to be married to the par&s;on's younge&s;t daughter, and &s;he is a pretty creature, and <HI>di&s;|arves</HI> him if he was more richer, and hand&s;omer than he is; but whatever is the matter, the old folks have changed their mind, and his aunt, they &s;ay, wants to make up a match between him and a fine London lady that boards at the par|&s;on's; but I'll never believe it till I &s;ee it, for &s;he and the par&s;on's daughter are great friends, they &s;ay, and it would not be a friendly part to rob the poor girl of her &s;weetheart. To &s;ay the truth, I believe there is &s;ome juggling among them; but this I keep to my&s;elf, for I would not make mi&s;chief; therefore I never tell my thoughts to any body, but I wi&s;h the young folks well.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, who had li&s;tened to her with great emotion, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her now, that he might be at liberty to reflect on what he had heard, which al|though it did not lead him to a full di&s;covery of the truth, yet it &s;ugge&s;ted thoughts which relieved him in &s;ome degree from tho&s;e dreadful pangs of jealou&s;y with which he had hitherto been tortured, and balanced at lea&s;t his fears and his hopes.</P>
<P>His impatience to free him&s;elf from this &s;tate of perplexity and &s;u&s;pence, allowed him but little repo&s;e that night; he ro&s;e as &s;oon as the day appear|ed, and it was with &s;ome difficulty that he pre|vailed
<PB N="588" REF="193">
upon him&s;elf to defer his vi&s;it till a &s;ea&s;on|able hour; and then being informed that Mr. Law|&s;on's hou&s;e was &s;carce a mile di&s;tant, he left his &s;ervant and hor&s;es at the inn, and walked thither, amid&s;t a thou&s;and anxious thoughts, which made him dread as much as he wi&s;hed for an interview, which was to decide his fate.</P>
<P>As he drew near the hou&s;e, he perceived a young man &s;auntering about in an adjacent field, who&s;e air and mien had a great re&s;emblance of the youth whom he had &s;een in the inn. Sir Charles, eager to &s;atisfy his doubts, followed him at a di&s;tance, and the youth turning again his wi&s;hing eyes towards the hou&s;e, the baronet had a full view of his face.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his brea&s;t: he ha&s;tily retreated behind the hedge, determined to watch his mo|tions; for he imagined, and with rea&s;on, that he came there to meet his mi&s;tre&s;s; and who that mi|&s;tre&s;s was, whether Sophia, or the curate's daugher, was the di&s;tracting doubt, which he now expected to have &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>He walked along by the &s;ide of the hedge, &s;till keeping William in &s;ight, who &s;uddenly turning back, rather flew than ran to meet a woman who beckoned to him. Sir Charles &s;aw at once his So|phia, and the fatal &s;ign, which planted a thou&s;and daggers in his heart. Trembling and pale he leaned again&s;t a tree, which concealed him from view, and &s;aw her advance towards his rival, &s;aw her in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with him; and, to compleat his di&s;traction and de&s;pair, &s;aw the happy youth throw him&s;elf at
<PB N="589" REF="194">
her feet, doubtle&s;s to thank her for the &s;acrifice &s;he made to him of a richer lover.</P>
<P>Such was the inference he drew from this action; and now rage and indignation &s;ucceeding to grief, in the&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports, he was upon the point of di&s;covering him&s;elf, and &s;acrificing the hated youth to his vengeance; but a moment's reflection &s;hewed him the di&s;honour of a conte&s;t with &s;o de&s;picable a rival, and turned all his re&s;entment again&s;t Sophia, who having quitted her &s;uppo&s;ed lover, took her way back again to the hou&s;e. Sir Charles followed her with di&s;ordered ha&s;te, re&s;olved to load her with reproaches for her incon&s;tancy; then, unwilling to gratify her pride by &s;uch an acknowledgment of his weakne&s;s, he turned back, cur&s;ing love, women, and his own ill fate. In this temper he wandered about a long time; at la&s;t he again returned to the inn, where after giving orders to have his hor&s;es got ready, he wrote that letter to Mr. Herbert, in which he &s;o well di&s;gui&s;ed the angui&s;h of his heart, that the good old man believed his breaking off the affair was the effect of his lightne&s;s and incon|&s;tancy only, though Sophia's quicker penetration ea&s;ily di&s;covered the latent jealou&s;y that had dic|tated it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ordered his &s;ervant to deliver the let|ter into Mr. Herbert's hands; then mounting his hor&s;e, he bid him follow him as &s;oon as he had ex|ecuted his commi&s;&s;ion. The young baronet, who retired to his country &s;eat to conceal his melan|choly, and fondly flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould &s;oon overcome that fatal pa&s;&s;ion which had been
<PB N="590" REF="195">
the &s;ource of &s;o much di&s;gu&s;t to him, found his mind &s;o cruelly tortured with the remembrance of Sophia, that he rea&s;&s;umed his fir&s;t de&s;ign of going abroad, and unfortunately &s;et out for Dover, the day before Mr. Herbert's arrival.</P>
<P>The good old man being obliged to &s;end Sophia this bad news, filled his letter with tender con&s;o|lations, and wi&s;e and prudent coun&s;els: he ex|horted her to bear this &s;troke of fortune with that dignity of patience which di&s;tingui&s;hes the good and wi&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>The virtue of pro&s;perity, &s;aid he, is tempe|rance, the virtue of adver&s;ity fortitude; it is this la&s;t which you are now called upon to ex|ert, and which the innocence of your life may well in&s;pire you with; for be a&s;&s;ured, my dear child, that it is the greate&s;t con&s;olation under misfortunes to be con&s;cious of having always meant well, and to be convinced that nothing but guilt de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as a &s;evere evil.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia in her an&s;wer di&s;played a mind &s;trug|gling again&s;t its own tenderne&s;s, offering up its di&s;appointed hopes, its griefs, and de&s;ires, in pious &s;acrifice to the will of Providence, and &s;eeking in religion all its con&s;olation and &s;upport.</P>
<P><Q>Can a virtuous per&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, however oppre&s;&s;ed by poverty, and in con&s;equence ne|glected by the world, be &s;aid to want friends and comforters who can look into his own mind with mode&s;t approbation, and to whom recol|lection furni&s;hes a &s;ource of joy?

<HEAD>ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN, CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>OUR modern writers, with indefatigable in|du&s;try, have given us a mo&s;t exact hi&s;torical dictionary of the &s;everal Saxon monarchs, who &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively reigned in the &s;even kingdoms of Britain. Dictionaries are always voluminous, but always u&s;eful; they are le&s;&s;er libraries, and the compilers of them are entitled to the highe&s;t acknowledge|ments from all lovers of learning. I have gone through the&s;e biographical lexicons, which, like the chronicles of the kings of I&s;rael, give us many barbarous names that tend rather to weary than to indulge our curio&s;ity. The times indeed are at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and the face of government has been long &s;ince &s;o entirely changed, that we are &s;carce any farther intere&s;ted in the Saxon hep|tarchy, than as it &s;erves to continue and compleat the line of our Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Within the &s;pace of &s;ixty years from the arrival of Augu&s;tine, the people of England were entirely converted from pagani&s;m to chri&s;tianity; but, as in general they had been converted by monks, mo&s;t of them were taught, that a monki&s;h life was the
<PB N="594" REF="199">
&s;ure&s;t, and perhaps the only road to heaven: and, in obedience to this doctrine, &s;everal of the kings renounced their thrones, quitted all commerce with the world, and retired into mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>The heptarchy is a field where &s;o little grain is to be reaped, and where the &s;mall produce is mixed and choaked with &s;o many mona&s;tic tares and brambles, the mo&s;t &s;uccinct and effectual me|thod will be only to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e princes who, by remarkable actions, or from particular events, have particularly de&s;erved the attention of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of Northumberland, Edwin di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf more than any other of the Saxon kings. He was &s;on of Alla, king of Deira; but his father dying when he was only three years old, Adelfrid, king of Bernicia, who had married Edwin's &s;i&s;ter, &s;eized the kingdom of Deira, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the orphan's throne. By &s;uch an union of the two kingdoms, Adelfrid became extremely powerful, and was able to rai&s;e a con|&s;iderable body of forces again&s;t the Welch, the Picts, and the Scots. But the unfortunate Edwin was reduced to the greate&s;t extremities, and was in perpetual danger. All the princes of England &s;tood in awe of Adelfrid, and were afraid to give a &s;anctuary to his rival; till Redwald, king of Ea&s;t Anglia, from a compa&s;&s;ion to Edwin's mi&s;erable &s;ituation, openly received him at his court. Adel|frid, the Cromwell of tho&s;e days, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the king of the Ea&s;t Angles, to require the &s;ur|render of Edwin's per&s;on, or in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to threaten an immediate declaration of war. Redwald
<PB N="595" REF="200">
for &s;ome time was &s;taggered and di&s;concerted by the emba&s;&s;y. He found within his brea&s;t a &s;truggle between honour and prudence. If he protected Edwin, he run the hazard of lo&s;ing his own king|dom: if he yielded up a gue&s;t whom he had vo|luntarily received, where was the faith of princes? who could rely upon the honour of a king? This la&s;t con&s;ideration, fortified again by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his queen, determined Redwald to protect Ed|win, and not only to protect his per&s;on, but to take up arms in his defence. Courage was the charac|teri&s;tic of tho&s;e times. Redwald, Edwin, Adelfrid, were all equally brave: the two former entered the kingdom of Northumberland, and came to an en|gagement with Adelfrid, in which the Northum|brians were entirely conquered. Adelfrid fell like Cataline: <HI>Longe a &s;uis inter ho&s;tium cadavera reper|tus e&s;t, paululum etiam &s;pirans &s;erociamque animi quam habuerat vivus in vultu retinens.</HI>
<Q>His body was found at a di&s;tance from his own troops, in the mid&s;t of a heap of enemies whom he had &s;lain. He &s;till breathed, and his features &s;till maintain|ed that fiercene&s;s of &s;oul, which they had ex|pre&s;&s;ed during the vigour of his life.</Q></P>
<P>Edwin, after the death of Adelfrid, by the con&s;ent, or rather by the gift of Redwald, who&s;e troops had gained the conque&s;t, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of Northumberland. His reign, during &s;everal years, was pro&s;perous, and except &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s plots again&s;t his per&s;on, was, in every re&s;pect, happy to him&s;elf, and to his people. His &s;pirit and his conduct made him the chief mo|narch of the heptarchy. His laws were executed
<PB N="596" REF="201">
with &s;o much efficacy, that a child might pa&s;s through Northumberland holding open a pur&s;e of gold, without danger of being robbed. He was a pagan when he a&s;cended the throne, but after his marriage with Ethelburga, &s;i&s;ter of the king of Kent, he became a chri&s;tian, and in the year 627, was publicly baptized at York.</P>
<P>Edwin maintained his dignity with true &s;plendor. An en&s;ign, in the form of a globe, was con&s;tantly carried before him, as a &s;ymbol, that in his per|&s;on was united the heptarchical government. What a lo&s;s have we in being totally ignorant of his laws! for although hi&s;torians repre&s;ent him as a prince of great ambition, his under&s;tanding, policy, and conduct are remarkably extolled. His great|ne&s;s drew upon him the envy of all the other mo|narchs in Britain; e&s;pecially of Cadwallo, king of Wales, and Penda, king of Mercia. The&s;e two princes joined their forces again&s;t Edwin, who with undaunted bravery, and an inferior number of troops, gave them battle at Heathfield, in York|&s;hire. The victory &s;eemed to be inclining on the &s;ide of the king of Northumberland, when his elde&s;t &s;on Offrid, was killed by an arrow, and fell dead at his father's feet. Edwin, in the in&s;tanta|neous rage of a parent, lo&s;t all his &s;teadine&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind, and ru&s;hing with all the violence of de&s;pair, into the mid&s;t of his enemies, he &s;oon gained the death which he de&s;ired; and by his death, his &s;ubjects the Northumbrians, lo&s;t the day.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing wars, and the confu&s;ion that fol|lowed in Northumberland, are de&s;cribed with all the horrors of deva&s;tation and &s;laughter. The
<PB N="597" REF="202">
kingdom remained in the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery, till it was &s;ecured by O&s;wald the &s;on of Adelfrid, who after his father's death had taken refuge in Scotland. He is repre&s;ented as a prince of great virtue, and of abilities nece&s;&s;ary and proper for a throne. He was &s;lain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 642, in the thirty-eighth year of his age.</NOTE> in a battle again&s;t an invader of his king|dom. Penda, king of Mercia, who finding among the &s;lain the dead body of O&s;wald, ordered it to be cut into &s;mall pieces, and each piece to be placed upon a &s;take, as &s;o many vi&s;ible trophies of victory: &s;uch was the barbarous rage of tho&s;e times; nor did that barbarity &s;ub&s;ide, unle&s;s when it was &s;ometimes changed by the power of the monks, into the folly of &s;uper&s;tition, and the droni&s;hne&s;s of indolence. To repre&s;ent &s;uch &s;cenes would be only tedious and di&s;agreeable. However, there are &s;ome remaining kings of Nor|thumberland who de&s;erve to be remembered.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e Egfrid may claim particular no|tice. In the year 670, he &s;ucceeded his father O&s;wy, in the kingdom of Bernicia, and &s;oon after|wards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Deira.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bernicia and Deira were the two parts in which Nor|thumberland was divided.</NOTE> In the year 684, he &s;ent over an army to conquer Ireland. The enterprize was fru&s;trated, and the Northumbrians were repul&s;ed. In the following year, he per|&s;onally attacked Scotland, and was joined by a con&s;ederate army of Picts; his allies &s;oon de&s;erted him, and he was compelled to return wounded to his own dominions. In the year 686, he endea|voured
<PB N="598" REF="203">
to revenge him&s;elf again&s;t the Picts, who retired ha&s;tily before him, and by that &s;tratagem led him forward into an ambu&s;h, where he was &s;lain.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances &s;hew him to have been of a martial a&s;piring genius: he was the fir&s;t Briti&s;h prince who re&s;i&s;ted, or rather defied, the papal au|thority. The popes had been always looked upon as &s;acred and infallible; but Alfrid paid no regard to their a&s;&s;umed infallibility. He deprived Wil|fred, bi&s;hop of York, of his bi&s;hopric, and &s;eized all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which were great, even to an ama|zing degree of opulency. Wilfred appealed to the pope: the &s;ynod of Rome ordered that Wilfred &s;hould be re&s;tored to his bi&s;hopric. He returned to England, and produced an authentic copy of the &s;entence. Egfrid, in a full council of nobility and clergy, treated the papal ordinances and ju|ri&s;diction, not only with contempt, but with re|&s;entment. Wilfred, in&s;tead of being re&s;tored, or receiving any kind of compen&s;ation, was taken in|to cu&s;tody, and &s;entenced to a clo&s;e impri&s;onment.

<P>It is &s;carce worth while to enter into any parti|cular character of the &s;ucceeding kings of Nor|thumberland, e&s;pecially &s;ince they will find few who are di&s;tingui&s;hably great in the exact catalogue which has been made of them by &s;everal of our hi&s;torians. From the death of Egfrid, who left no children, the Northumbrian kingdom &s;eems

to have declined. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion became uncer|tain: the civil wars encrea&s;ed; &s;o that after the continuance of three hundred and twenty-eight years, Northumberland, torn to pieces by inte&s;tine calamities, was totally ab&s;orbed in the kingdom of Mercia.</P>
<P>The next century produced a king of Mercia, Offa, who rendered him&s;elf mo&s;t eminently renown|ed in arms: with &s;ome virtues, he had the particular vices which are in&s;eparable from ambition and a boundle&s;s thir&s;t of power. He was one of tho&s;e dauntle&s;s heroes, who imagine that,
<Q>Whoever will be great mu&s;t be wicked.</Q>
Such men will be terrible, not beloved. They neglect the affec|tion, and work only on the fears of the people. They may be followed, but will never be re&s;pected. Their actions may &s;trike wonder, but cannot excite applau&s;e: however, they are frequently, if not al|ways, the immediate means made u&s;e of by pro|vidence to bring about extraordinary revolutions. Their &s;ucce&s;s and their greatne&s;s make them vain: like the fly upon the chariot, they imagine that they rai&s;e all the du&s;t, while the &s;ecret hand of heaven turns the wheel.</P>
<P>Offa well knew that the fir&s;t maxim of ambition is an extent of territories: he had his eye upon the kingdom of Ea&s;t Anglia. Ethelbert, a prince of a very amiable character, reigned there. Offa, with the greate&s;t &s;hew of friend&s;hip, invited him to his court. The king of the Ea&s;t Angles accepted the invitation: Offa murdered him in the mo&s;t treacherous manner. Ethelbert was the la&s;t of his race, and with him peri&s;hed his kingdom. It was
<PB N="600" REF="205">
united to Mercia, after a &s;eparate, but tributary exi&s;tence of two hundred and &s;eventeen years.</P>
<P>Offa died, I think, in the year 794, after a reign of thirty-nine years, in which his many victories rendered him exceeding powerful and tremendous. With him, perhaps, it will be mo&s;t proper to end the particular account of the heptarchy, &s;ince, al|though it may be &s;aid to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted about thirty years longer, till England became &s;ubject to one monarch only, yet the &s;everal kingdoms were &s;o often ravaged, their governments disjointed, and their boundaries attenuated, extended, or laid wa&s;te, that the di&s;tant de&s;cription of &s;uch changes mu&s;t be almo&s;t as much confu&s;ed as the original &s;cenes them&s;elves. Mercia held out the longe&s;t, as the conque&s;ts gained by Offa had rendered it very for|midable: but Mercia yielded at la&s;t, after having &s;ubdued a great part of Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Wales, and &s;everal other provinces in Britain.</P>
<P>The heptarchy was &s;o different a form of go|vernment from any that had before prevailed, and gave &s;o total an alteration to the Engli&s;h &s;tate, that a &s;ummary review of it may not be unacceptable. It began as all new &s;y&s;tems of empire begin, with wi&s;dom and order. Whether the Saxons were called in, or whether they landed of their own ac|cord, is a point not ab&s;olutely decided; but mo&s;t certainly &s;ome years after their arrival, they became our conquerors. Some of their battles with the Britons were bloody and cruel: their adver&s;aries, in their turn, &s;hewed little le&s;s compa&s;&s;ion or hu|manity. When the &s;even kingdoms were &s;ettled and divided, the Saxon religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed,
<PB N="601" REF="206">
and it &s;eems to have gained con&s;iderable ground over chri&s;tianity, till the arrival of St. Au&s;tin.</P>
<P>The outward forms of the Romi&s;h church were &s;o much finer and more embelli&s;hed than the plainer ceremonies of Woden and Thor, that the people were ea&s;ily induced to quit pagani&s;m for what was called chri&s;tianity. The ignorance of the times contributed much to their conver&s;ion. All appearances of learning were centered in the prie&s;ts; and, with the true art of &s;acerdotal cun|ning, they pointed out different paths to heaven, according to the different di&s;po&s;itions of the per|&s;ons who were de&s;irous to travel the road: &s;o that after the fir&s;t monki&s;h times of melancholy and retirement, journies were undertaken to Rome, miraculous images were gorgeou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed up, various &s;orts of idolatry were practi&s;ed in the mo&s;t public manner, with equal devotion by the princes, and their &s;ubjects of every degree. The truth is, many of the heptarchical monarchs were either weakly devout, or wickedly inhuman; governed by hypocritical prelates, or governing by lawle&s;s tyranny; inferior to common &s;en&s;e, or &s;uperior to all religion and morality; tamely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive or bru|tally de&s;tructive. How was it po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a government to &s;ub&s;i&s;t? only by the accidental &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome kings of abilities and under|&s;tanding: by the prudence of &s;ome prelates, who at the &s;ame time that they &s;upported the church, defended the &s;tate; and by the wi&s;e re&s;olutions ta|ken in the wittenagemot, or great council of the land. During the inte&s;tine wars of the heptarchy, it is to be pre&s;umed that this council could neither
<PB N="602" REF="207">
meet &s;o often, nor bear &s;o great an influence, as in more peaceable and &s;ettled times; yet it was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in&s;titution of the Saxon government. Before the arrival of St. Au&s;tin, few records are to be found of it. The clergy, as they grew more powerful, became very leading members in the wittenagemot. They appeared, and gave their voices in that a&s;&s;embly; and at the &s;ame time they lo&s;t no opportunities of a&s;&s;uming all po&s;&s;ible power and prerogatives entirely to them&s;elves, &s;o as to become &s;uperior to the king in mo&s;t if not all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. Thus in one of the canons pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;ynod, anno 694, we find this expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>Neque de hac re aliquid pertineat ad regis &s;aecu|laris imperium.</HI> "With this affair," [the govern|ment and appointment of abbots, abbote&s;&s;es, pre&s;by|ters, and deacons,] "the king has nothing to do."</P>
<P>But what are become of the native Britons? Lo&s;t and buried as it were among the Saxons. Few, very few remaining, and tho&s;e in corners of the i&s;land, un&s;een and unknown. Unhappy people! hidden at home in rocks and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, or driven abroad, like vagabonds, in que&s;t of habitations: de&s;troyed by wars, wa&s;ted by time, wounded by per&s;ecution, and &s;unk into eternal oblivion.</P>
<P>To the Saxons therefore the pre&s;ent race of Eng|li&s;h may be &s;aid to owe their original, tho&s;e parts of Wales and Cornwall excepted, who&s;e inhabitants by their mountainous &s;ituation may po&s;&s;ibly have flowed in an uninterrupted channel, from the Abo|rigines of our i&s;land.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, if I am not mi&s;taken, by Bede, that now and then a true Briti&s;h chieftain &s;tept into
<PB N="603" REF="208">
one of the thrones. This might have happened towards the latter end of the heptarchy, when all was confu&s;ion; but the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive line of kings, in general, con&s;i&s;ted of Engli&s;h Saxons; not cho&s;en in an hereditary, nor ab&s;olutely in an elective man|ner, oftner by caprice than by judgment. They &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded by accident, &s;ometimes by cunning, &s;ometimes by force. Many of them were murdered, many were dethroned, many fell in battle, and many crept into religious cells.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have repre&s;ented the black part of the tablet; let us turn to a fairer &s;ide. The Britons certainly owe the fir&s;t in&s;titution of order and go|vernment to the Saxons. The Saxons owe the fir&s;t in&s;titution of their church-government to St. Au&s;tin. Their civil policy, which they tran&s;planted with them, had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Germany: it was Gothick, but it was regular. As &s;oon as they &s;ettled them&s;elves in England, a king became an additional part of their con&s;titution. The con|tract between the king and his people was mutual; they were bound to defend each other: the pro|perties on both &s;ides were a&s;certained: the people had their patrimonies, the king had his regalities.</P>
<P>The nobility were next to the king in dignity. This high rank could only be attained by remark|able and brave actions; either by great atchieve|ments in war, or by &s;agacity and wi&s;dom in peace. The honour, when attained, went in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the next heir, but was &s;till to be forfeited by ba&s;e|ne&s;s and degeneracy.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent order of people were the free|men: they were joined in judicature with the no|bility:
<PB N="604" REF="209">
they were above all arbitrary power; nor were they liable to any compul&s;ive law to which they did not voluntarily give their con&s;ent. They were much more numerous than the nobles, and con&s;equently were the chief bulwarks of legal ju|&s;tice, and every other branch of liberty. They were divided into two &s;ets, being cho&s;en to the rank of freemen, either from their &s;uperior merit, or from their great military &s;ervice, and the large po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions which they had gained in war.</P>
<P>The inferior and meane&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the Saxons were in a &s;tate of bondage; &s;ubject to the will, di&s;po&s;ition, and commands of their landlords. They were called villains, becau&s;e the lands which they occupied were held in villenage, or &s;ervitude. The&s;e were the only people who were exempted from the power of voting in the wittenagemot.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e councils, convened by Ina, king of the We&s;t Saxons, is entitled <HI>Con&s;ilium omnium &s;api|entum &s;enicrum et populorum totius regni.</HI>
<Q>A coun|cil of all the wi&s;e men, the elders, and the people of the whole kingdom.</Q>
In another council con|vened at Winche&s;ter, in the year 855, it is &s;aid to have been held in pre&s;ence of the great, men, <HI>ali|xum fidelium infinita multitudine,</HI>
<Q>And of an in|finite number of other faithful freemen.</Q>
The inconveniencies ari&s;ing from &s;o general and un|limited a privilege mu&s;t have been very great.</P>
<P>I have &s;o often mentioned the Picts, that before we quit entirely a view of the heptarchy, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to attempt &s;ome account of their ori|ginal. Authors differ widely upon the point: &s;ome are of opinion that the Picts broke in upon
<PB N="605" REF="210">
Scotland, at a time when the Caledonians were in a reduced langui&s;hing &s;tate, unable to defend them|selves. Bi&s;hop Stillingfleet imagines that they came from European Scythia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, as al&s;o Diodorus and Pliny, &s;uppo&s;es, that Scy|thia Europrea extended to the utmo&s;t bounds of the north, and includes, among the Scythians, the antient inhabitants of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Daci Getae, &amp;c. INNES'S E&s;&s;ays, page 67.</NOTE>, others &s;uppo&s;e that they arrived from a different part of the nor|thern continent. The mo&s;t probable conjecture is Tyrrhel's:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tyrrhel, page 5 and 6.</NOTE> he &s;ays,
<Q>That the Picts were the remainder of tho&s;e Britons who pre&s;erved their liberty by re&s;i&s;ting the Roman arms, and were at la&s;t divided from the Roman Britons, by a wall, now called the Picts wall, (the ve&s;tiges of which are to be &s;een to this day,) drawn between the mouths of the rivers Tyne, and E&s;ke, to hin|der their farther incur&s;ions into tho&s;e parts which were then under the Roman empire.</Q>
They may be &s;aid to be the &s;ame people with the Caledonians, as the Welch are &s;aid to be the &s;ame people with the Engli&s;h. They were a colony who kept them|&s;elves &s;eparated from the main body, and were di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the Scots, by the name of Picts, as they continued the cu&s;tom, which ori|ginally had been common to all the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, of painting their bodies with various figures; even after that practice had been long neglected, and laid a&s;ide by all the re&s;t of the Britons. The per|petual incur&s;ions of the Picts into the more &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land may have proceeded from an
<PB N="608" REF="211">
one, a more compo&s;ed and regular &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment pre&s;ented it&s;elf to view.</P>
<P>The heptarchy was a fabric which for &s;ome years had been growing too heavy for it&s;elf. Seve|ral of the partitions which had been framed and fitted within it, had either bur&s;t a&s;under, or were forcibly de&s;troyed. The building had been tot|tering long before it fell. A &s;kilful arti&s;t was wanting to gather up the be&s;t materials, and to form a new edifice of magnificence and duration. Such an architect was found in the per&s;on of Eg|bert, king of the We&s;t Saxons.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P><Q>BE not apprehen&s;ive of any harm, &s;aid he to me, as he approached; I come by the com|mand of madame de Benavides: &s;he has had e&s;teem enough for me, to tru&s;t me with every thing relating to you, probably, (added he, with a &s;igh which he could not &s;uppre&s;s,) &s;he would have judged differently if &s;he had known me well; but I will be ju&s;t to her confidence; I will &s;ave you, and I will &s;ave her, if I can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;hall not &s;ave me, replied I; it is my duty to ju&s;tify the innocence of madame de Be|navides, and I will do it at the expence of a thou&s;and lives, if I had them to lo&s;e.</Q>
I then acquainted him with my de&s;ign of keeping my|&s;elf concealed, and pa&s;&s;ing for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, to prevent any imputation falling upon her.</P>
<P><Q>This project might be nece&s;&s;ary, replied Don Gabriel, if my brother was dead, as I perceive you think, but his wound, although great, is pro|bably not mortal, and the fir&s;t &s;ign of life and
<PB N="610" REF="213">
&s;en&s;e he gave, was to order that madame de Bena|vides &s;hould be confined to her own apartment: this proves that he &s;u&s;pects you are her lover, and if you per&s;i&s;t in your de&s;ign, you will lo&s;e your own life, without pre&s;erving hers. Let us go, added he, the &s;afety I offer you to-day, I pro|bably cannot afford you to-morrow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And what will become of madame de Benavides? cried I; no, I can never re&s;olve to withdraw my|&s;elf from danger, and to leave her in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have already told you, replied Don Gabriel, that your pre&s;ence will only render her &s;ituation wor&s;e.</Q>
<Q>Well, &s;aid I, &s;ighing, I will fly, &s;ince you will have it &s;o, and that her intere&s;t demands it. I had hoped that by the &s;acrifice I had in|tended to make her of my life, I &s;hould at lea&s;t have been pitied by her; but I de&s;erve not to have this con&s;olation: I am an unhappy wretch, who am not even worthy to die for her. Pro|tect her, added I, to Don Gabriel, the tears &s;treaming from my eyes as I &s;poke: you are ge|nerous; her innocence, her misfortunes mu&s;t move you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may judge, &s;aid he, by what has e&s;caped me, that I am too much for my own quiet con|cerned in the fate of madame de Benavides. I will do every thing for her. Alas! added he, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf well paid, if I could have hoped that &s;he had loved no one. How is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with your good fortune in having touched a heart like hers? but let us go, pur&s;ued he, let us take advantage of the night.</Q>
Then taking my hand
<PB N="611" REF="214">
and turning a dark lanthorn, he led me through the courts of the ca&s;tle. Tran&s;ported with rage again&s;t my&s;elf for what I had done, in the wildne&s;s of my de&s;pair, I wi&s;hed my&s;elf &s;till more mi&s;erable than I was.</P>
<P>Don Gabriel, when he left me, advi&s;ed me to retire to a convent of religious, which was within a quarter of a league of the ca&s;tle.
<Q>You mu&s;t, &s;aid he, keep your&s;elf concealed in their hou&s;e for &s;ome days, that you may not be in danger from the &s;earch I my&s;elf &s;hall be obliged to make for you; and here is a letter for one of tho&s;e religious, which will procure you admi&s;|&s;ion into the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I loitered a long time about the ca&s;tle after he left me, not being able to remove my&s;elf from the place where Adelaida was; at length the de&s;ire of hearing all that happened to her, determined me to &s;et out for the convent. I arrived there ju&s;t at day-break, the religious to whom I pre&s;ented Don Gabriel's letter received me very civilly, and con|ducted me into a chamber near his own. My pale|ne&s;s, and the blood he ob&s;erved on my cloaths, made him apprehen&s;ive that I was wounded. He was beginning to enquire after my health, when I fainted away. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ervant he put me to bed, and &s;ent for a &s;urgeon belonging to the convent to examine my wound: he declared that it was in a dangerous condition, through the fatigue and cold I had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>When I was alone with the good father to whom I was recommended, I intreated him to &s;end to a hou&s;e in a certain village, which I named to him,
<PB N="612" REF="215">
to enquire for Saint Laurent, for I &s;uppo&s;ed he would take refuge there: I was not mi&s;taken; he came with the me&s;&s;enger I had &s;ent to him: the poor fellow was in exce&s;&s;ive affliction when he heard that I was wounded: he approached my bed-&s;ide, and anxiou&s;ly enquired how I did.</P>
<P><Q>If you would &s;ave my life, &s;aid I to him, you mu&s;t learn in what &s;tate madame de Benavides is, inform your&s;elf of all that has pa&s;&s;ed; ha&s;te, lo&s;e not a moment, and remember that what I &s;uffer in this uncertainty, is ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death.</Q>
Saint Laurent promi&s;ed to do every thing I de&s;ired, and went away to take proper mea&s;ures to &s;atisfy me.</P>
<P>Mean time I was &s;eized with a violent fever, my wound grew more dangerous, they were obliged to make great inci&s;ions, but the torments of my mind made me almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e of my body; the image of madame de Benavides bathed in tears, as I had &s;een her when I left her chamber, and kneeling by her hu&s;band, whom I had wounded, was continually before my eyes. I took a re|view of the misfortunes of her life; I found my|&s;elf in all: her marriage, to which &s;he was forced on my account, her fatal choice of the mo&s;t jealous and brutal man in the world for a hu&s;band, was made for my &s;ake; and I had lately compleated all her misfortunes, by expo&s;ing her reputation to injurious cen&s;ures. I called to my remembrance the unju&s;t jealou&s;y I had di&s;covered, which al|though it had la&s;ted but a few moments, and was ba|ni&s;hed by a &s;ingle word from her, yet I could never pardon my&s;elf for. Adelaida could not but think
<PB N="613" REF="216">
me unworthy of her e&s;teem; &s;he could do no other|wi&s;e than hate me.</P>
<P>Saint Laurent returned the next day; he informed me that Benavides was &s;till extremely ill of his wound; that Adelaida was in the utmo&s;t affliction; and that Don Gabriel made a &s;hew of &s;eeking for me every where. This news was not very likely to calm the perturbation of my mind. I know not what I ought to wi&s;h for, every thing was again&s;t me. I could not even wi&s;h for death; I thought I owed the prolonging of my wretched life to the ju&s;tification of madame de Benavides.</P>
<P>The good father to whom I was recommended beheld me with great compa&s;&s;ion: he heard me &s;igh continually, and always found my face bathed in tears. He was a man of &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, who had been long in the world, and whom a con|currence of &s;trange accidents had driven into a cloi&s;ter: he did not endeavour to rea&s;on me out of my grief, or to con&s;ole me by the u&s;ual methods; he only expre&s;&s;ed great &s;en&s;ibility of my misfor|tunes. This way &s;ucceeded; by degrees he entirely gained my confidence, perhaps al&s;o I only wanted an opportunity to &s;peak and to complain to him. I conceived &s;o great an affection and e&s;teem for him, that I related to him my whole &s;tory. He became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to me after a few days &s;tay in the convent, that I could not bear him to be ab|&s;ent from me a moment. I never met with a man that had more goodne&s;s of heart: I repeated to him the &s;ame things a thou&s;and times over; he al|ways li&s;tened to me with the utmo&s;t attention, and &s;ympathi&s;ed in all my griefs.</P>
<P><PB N="614" REF="217">It was through him that I learned every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Benavides: he had been in great danger from his wound, but it was at length cured. I was informed of it by Don Jerome, &s;o was my friend the religious called. He after|wards told me, that all &s;eemed quiet in the ca&s;tle; that madame de Benavides lived more retired than before, and that &s;he was in a very langui&s;hing &s;tate of health. He added, that I mu&s;t re&s;olve to re|move as &s;oon as I was able; for if it &s;hould be di&s;|covered that I was concealed there, it would expo&s;e the lady to new di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>It was not likely that I &s;hould be &s;oon in a con|dition to leave the convent; I was wa&s;ting away with a continual fever, and my wound was not yet healed. I had been in this religious hou&s;e above two months, when one day I ob&s;erved Don Jerome to be pen&s;ive and melancholy; he always turned his eyes away when they met mine; he &s;eemed &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid looking at me, and with dif|ficulty an&s;wered my que&s;tions. I had conceived a very tender friend&s;hip for him; misfortunes give &s;en&s;ibility to the heart. I was going to expre&s;s my concern for his unea&s;ine&s;s, and to enquire into the cau&s;e, when Saint Laurent entering my chamber, told me that Don Gabriel was in the convent, and that he had ju&s;t met him.</P>
<P><Q>Don Gabriel here, &s;aid I, looking at Don Je|rome, and you never to mention to me his coming! what is the meaning of this re&s;erve? you fill me with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions; what is become of madame de Benavides? for pity draw me out of this cruel uncertainty.</Q>
<PB N="615" REF="218">
"Would I could leave you always in it." &s;aid Don Jerome at length, embracing me.</P>
<P><Q>Ah, cried I, &s;he is dead, Adelaida is dead; Benavides has &s;acrificed her to his rage. You an&s;wer me not&mdash;alas! then I have nothing to hope: Ah! it was not Benavides, but I who have plunged the poniard into her brea&s;t: had it not been for my fatal pa&s;&s;ion &s;he might have been &s;till alive&mdash;Adelaida is dead; I &s;hall never behold her more&mdash;I have lo&s;t her for ever, &s;he is dead, and I &s;till live! why do I not follow her? why do I delay to revenge her upon her murderer? alas! death would be too great an indulgence to me; it would &s;eparate me from my|&s;elf, and I am made up of horror and angui&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>The violent agitation I was in cau&s;ed my wound, which was not well healed, to open again. I lo&s;t &s;o much blood that I fell into a &s;woon, which la&s;ted &s;o long that they thought me dead: but after con|tinuing &s;everal hours in this happy &s;tate of in&s;en|&s;ibility, I woke to grief unutterable. Don Jerome, apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould make an attempt upon my own life, charged Saint Laurent to watch me with the &s;tricte&s;t attention. My de&s;pair now took another form: I complained not, I &s;hed not a tear; then it was that I formed a re&s;olution to go and inhabit &s;ome &s;olitude, where I might, without con|troul, deliver my&s;elf up a prey to my affliction.</P>
<P>I was de&s;irous of &s;eeing Don Gabriel, for I eagerly caught every thing that could heighten my de&s;pair. I intreated Don Jerone to bring him, and the next day they came together into my chamber; Don Gabriel &s;eated him&s;elf upon the &s;ide of my bed.

We continued along time &s;ilent; neither of us was able to &s;peak, he looked upon me with eyes &s;wim|ming in tears.
<Q>You are very generous, mon&s;ieur, &s;aid I at length, to vi&s;it a wretch whom you have &s;o much rea&s;on to hate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are too mi&s;erable, replied he, to make it po&s;&s;ible for me to hate you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, cried I, tell me, I be&s;eech you, every cir|cum&s;tance of my misfortunes, leave me ignorant of nothing; the explanation I de&s;ire of you may po&s;&s;ibly; prevent my taking &s;ome mea&s;ures which you have an intere&s;t to hinder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;hall redouble your affliction and my own, replied he, but I cannot help it&mdash;I will &s;atisfy you; and in the recital I am going to make you, you will find you are not the only per&s;on to be pitied. Take then the incidents in order as they happened; we &s;hall too &s;oon come to the melan|choly cata&s;trophe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I had never &s;een madame de Benavides till &s;he became my &s;i&s;ter-in-law. My brother, who had &s;ome affairs of con&s;equence to &s;ettle at Bour|deaux, &s;aw her there, and fell in love with her, and although he had &s;everal rivals, who&s;e birth and riches were &s;uperior to his, yet madame de Benavides, for rea&s;ons I never could gue&s;s at, preferred him to them all. A &s;hort time after their marriage, he brought her to his e&s;tate in Bi&s;cay, and there it was that I &s;aw her for the fir&s;t time; if her beauty excited my admiration, I was &s;till more charmed with the graces of her mind, and the extreme &s;weetne&s;s of her temper, which my brother put every day to new trials.
<PB N="617" REF="220">
However, the pa&s;&s;ion I then had for a very ami|able young per&s;on, made me believe that I was &s;ecured from the influence of her charms, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to behold without love: I even de&s;igned to make u&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter-in-law's inte|re&s;t with my brother, to prevail upon him to con&s;ent to our marriage. The father of my mi|&s;tre&s;s, offended at my brother's refu&s;al, had given me but a very &s;hort time to bring him to a com|pliance, declaring that when it was expired, he would marry his daughter to another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The friend&s;hip and e&s;teem which madame de Benavides expre&s;&s;ed for me, gave me courage to implore her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I often went to her apartment with an intention to &s;peak to her; but the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;tacle imaginable re&s;trained me. Mean while, the time which had been pre&s;cribed to me drew towards a period; I had received &s;e|veral letters from my mi&s;tre&s;s, in which &s;he pre&s;t me to u&s;e every method to gain my brother's con&s;ent. My an&s;wers did not &s;atisfy her: with|out my perceiving it, an air of coldne&s;s ran through them, which drew many complaints from her; the&s;e complaints appeared to me to be unju&s;t, and I reproached her with it. She now believed her&s;elf abandoned, and re&s;entment, joined to the commands of her father, determined her to marry the per&s;on he propo&s;ed to her. She her&s;elf in a letter &s;he wrote to me, informed me of her marriage; &s;he reproached me, but it was with tenderne&s;s, and concluded with ear|ne&s;tly intreating me never to &s;ee her more. I had loved her pa&s;&s;ionately; I imagined I &s;till
<PB N="618" REF="221">
loved her, and I could not learn that I had lo&s;t her for ever without feeling a real affliction. I was afraid &s;he was unhappy, and I reproached my&s;elf with being the cau&s;e of it. Ab&s;orbed with the&s;e reflections, I continued walking in a melancholy manner, in the little wood which you u&s;ed often to vi&s;it; there I was met by madame de Benavides, who, ob&s;erving my unea&s;i|ne&s;s, kindly de&s;ired to know the cau&s;e of it. A &s;ecret repugnance which I felt within my&s;elf restrained me from telling her: I could not re|&s;olve to own to her that I had been in love; but the plea&s;ure of &s;peaking to her of that pa&s;|&s;ion carried it over that con&s;ideration. All the&s;e emotions pa&s;&s;ed in my heart without my per|ceiving the cau&s;e: as yet I had not dared to ex|amine into the nature of what I felt for my &s;i&s;ter-in-law. I related my &s;tory to her: I &s;hewed her the letter which I&s;abella had wrote me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why did you not mention this &s;ooner to me? &s;aid madame de Benavides; perhaps I might have been able to obtain the con&s;ent of your bro|ther, though he refu&s;ed it to you. My God! how much I pity you, how greatly I am con|cerned for her: &s;he doubtle&s;s will be mi&s;erable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The compa&s;&s;ion which madame de Benavides expre&s;&s;ed for I&s;abella, made me apprehen&s;ive that &s;he would think hardly of me, as the per&s;on who had made her unhappy. To dimini&s;h therefore this compa&s;&s;ion, I eagerly told her that the hu&s;band of I&s;abella was a man of birth and merit; that he held a very con&s;iderable rank in
<PB N="619" REF="222">
the world; and that it was highly probable his fortune would be &s;till more &s;o.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are deceived, an&s;wered my lovely &s;i&s;ter-in-law, if you think all the&s;e advantages can make her happy; nothing can make a mends for the lo&s;s of what one loves. It is a cruel misfortune, added &s;he, when we are obliged to act contrary to our inclination, to comply with our duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She &s;ighed &s;everal times during this conver&s;ation; I even perceived that it was with difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her tears. She left me &s;oon afterwards; I had not power to follow her, I remained in a trouble and confu&s;ion I am not able to de&s;cribe. I now for the fir&s;t time perceived what I had hitherto indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from my&s;elf, that I was in love with my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and I thought I could di&s;cover a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion in her heart; a thou&s;and circum&s;tances then ru&s;hed upon my memory, which before I had given no attention to: her ta&s;te for &s;olitude, her indifference for all tho&s;e amu&s;ements which make the delight of per&s;ons of her &s;ex and age. Her extreme melancholy, which I had attributed to my brother's bad treat|ment of her, now &s;eemed to me to proceed from another cau&s;e. How many &s;ad reflections now ro&s;e in my mind! I found my&s;elf in love with a per&s;on whom I ought not to love, and this per|&s;on's heart in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If &s;he loved nothing, &s;aid I, my pa&s;&s;ion al|though without hope would not be without &s;weetne&s;s: I might pretend to the ble&s;&s;ing of her friend&s;hip; in that I would place my felicity. But this friend&s;hip will not &s;atisfy my heart,
<PB N="620" REF="223">
&s;ince &s;he has &s;entiments more tender for another. I was &s;en&s;ible I ought to u&s;e my utmo&s;t endea|vours to vanqui&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o dangerous to my quiet, and which honour would not permit me to entertain. I took a resolution to fly from my too lovely &s;i&s;ter; and I returned to the ca&s;tle to tell my brother that &s;ome affairs called me from him, but the &s;ight of madame de Benavides left me no power to follow the dictates of my rea&s;on. All my re&s;olutions vani&s;hed into air; yet to fur|ni&s;h my&s;elf with &s;ome pretence to continue near her, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that I was nece&s;&s;ary to her, in being &s;ometimes able to calm the tem|pe&s;tuous humour of her hu&s;band. About this time you arrived; I found in your air and be|haviour &s;omewhat greatly above the condition you appeared in: I treated you with familiarity and kindne&s;s. I would have entered into your confidence and have made you my friend. My in|tention was to prevail upon you afterwards to draw a picture of madame de Benavides for me; for notwith&s;tanding the delu&s;ive rea&s;ons my pa&s;|&s;ion found for &s;taying with my &s;i&s;ter, yet I re|&s;olved &s;ome time or other to leave the ca&s;tle: but in this &s;eparation &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, I was willing at lea&s;t to have her picture. The man|ner in which you received the advances I made you, &s;hewed me that I had nothing to hope for from you; and I was gone to bring another painter into the hou&s;e that unhappy day when you wounded my brother. Judge of my &s;urpri&s;e at my return, when I was informed of what had happened. My brother, who was de&s;perately
<PB N="921" REF="224">
kept a gloomy &s;ilence, ca&s;ting from time to time a terrible look upon madame de Benavides. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he called me to his bed-&s;ide. Deliver me, &s;aid he, from the &s;ight of a woman who has betrayed me; cau&s;e her to be conducted to her own apartment, and give &s;trict orders not to &s;uffer her to &s;tir out of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I would have &s;aid &s;omething again&s;t this ri|gorous order to my brother; but he interrupted me at the fir&s;t word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Do as I de&s;ire you, &s;aid he, or never &s;ee me more. I was obliged to obey; and, approaching my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, I intreated her to let me &s;peak to her in her own chamber. Let us go, &s;aid &s;he weeping, execute the order you have re|ceived.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e words, which had the air of a reproach, pierced me to the &s;oul: I dur&s;t not make her any an&s;wer in the place we were then in; but no &s;ooner had I led her to her chamber, than looking on her with that grief and tenderne&s;s my heart was full of, what madam, &s;aid I, do you confound me with your per&s;ecutor; I who feel your trouble as &s;en&s;ible as you do your&s;elf; I who would &s;acrifice my life to &s;ave you? I grieve to &s;ay it, but I tremble for you; retire for &s;ome time to a place of &s;afety, I will endea|vour to have you conducted wherever you plea&s;e, provided it is a &s;ecure a&s;ylum from your furious hu&s;band.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know not whether mon&s;ieur de Benavides has any de&s;ign to take away my life, but I know it is my duty not to abandon him, and I will
<PB N="622" REF="225">
fulfil it, though I peri&s;h.</Q>
Then after a &s;hort pau&s;e me added,
<Q>I am going, by placing an en|tire confidence in you, to give you the greate&s;t mark of my e&s;teem it is in my power to give; and indeed the confe&s;&s;ion I have to make you is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve yours for me. But go and attend your brother, a longer conver&s;ation may make you &s;u&s;pected by him; return hither as &s;oon as you conveniently can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I obeyed madame de Benavides, and went to my brother's apartment; the &s;urgeon had vi&s;ited him, and de&s;ired that no one might be allowed to come into his chamber. I flew back again to his wife, agitated with a thou&s;and different thoughts: I was anxious to know what &s;he had to &s;ay to me, and yet I feared to hear it. She related to me the manner in which &s;he became acquainted with you, the pa&s;&s;ion you conceived for her the moment you &s;aw her, the generous &s;acrifice you had made her, and &s;he did not con|ceal the tenderne&s;s with which you had in&s;pired her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, interupted I, have I then been dear to the mo&s;t perfect woman upon earth, and have I lo&s;t her?</Q>
This idea filled my &s;oul with &s;uch tender &s;orrow, that my tears which had hitherto been re&s;trained by the exce&s;s of my de&s;pair, began now to &s;tream in great abundance from my eyes.</P>
<P><Q>Yes, continued Don Gabriel, with a &s;igh, you were beloved. Good heaven! what tenderne&s;s did I not di&s;cover for you in her heart! Notwith|&s;tanding her misfortunes, and the horror of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I perceived that &s;he indulged
<PB N="623" REF="226">
with plea&s;ure the thought, that her affection for you was authori&s;ed by what you had done for her. She confe&s;&s;ed to me, that when I led her into the chamber where you was painting, &s;he knew you; and that &s;he had wrote to you, to command you to leave the ca&s;tle, but that &s;he could not find an opportunity to give you her letter: &s;he afterwards related to me how her hu&s;|band had &s;urpri&s;ed you together, at the very moment when you was bidding her an eternal farewel, that he attempted to kill her, but that you interpo&s;ed and wounded him in defending her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Save this unhappy man, added &s;he, you only can pre&s;erve him from the fate that waits him; for I know that in the fear of expo&s;ing me to the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, he will &s;uffer the mo&s;t cruel death, rather than declare who he is.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He is well rewarded for all he can &s;uffer, madam, replied I, by the good opinion you have of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have owned my weakne&s;s to you, &s;aid &s;he; but you have &s;een that if I am not mi&s;tre&s;s of my affections, I have at lea&s;t been &s;o of my conduct; and that I have taken no &s;teps which the mo&s;t rigorous virtue could condemn.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas! madam, interupted I, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould conde&s;cend to ju&s;tify your&s;elf to me. Too well am I convinced by my own ex|perience, that it is not always in our power to di&s;po&s;e of our own hearts: I will u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to obey you and deliver the count de Comminge; but, oh madam, permit me to
<PB N="624" REF="227">
a&s;&s;ure you, that I am more mi&s;erable than he is.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I left the room as I pronounced the&s;e words, without daring to rai&s;e my eyes to madame de Benavides. I &s;hut my&s;elf up in my own cham|ber, to con&s;ider what I had to do. I had already taken a re&s;olution to deliver you; but I was doubtful whether I ought not to fly from the ca&s;tle my&s;elf. The torments I had &s;uffered du|ring the relation madame de Benavides had made me, &s;hewed me the exce&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion for her. It was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s &s;entiments &s;o dangerous to our virtue; and in order to &s;uppre&s;s them, it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould &s;ee her no more; but it &s;eemed cruel to abandon her in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation; to leave her unprotected, in the hands of a hu&s;band who be|lieved him&s;elf wronged by her. After con|tinuing long irre&s;olute, I determined at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t madame de Benavides, and to avoid &s;eeing her as much as po&s;&s;ible. I could not inform her of your e&s;cape till next day: &s;he &s;eemed to be a little more ea&s;y on your account; but I thought I could perceive that her grief was in|crea&s;ed, and I doubted not but the declaration I had made of my &s;entiments was the cau&s;e. I quitted her immediately, in order to free her from the embarra&s;&s;ment my pre&s;ence threw her into. I was &s;everal days without &s;eeing her; my bro|ther grew wor&s;e, and his phy&s;ician thought him in great danger. I was obliged to make her a vi&s;it to acquaint her with this news.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="625" REF="228">
<Q>If I had lo&s;t Mon&s;ieur Benavides, &s;aid &s;he, in the ordinary methods of providence, his death would have le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly affected me; but the part I have unfortunately had in it, makes it an in&s;upportable affliction to me. I am not ap|prehen&s;ive of the ill treatment I may meet with from him; I am only afraid of his dying in a per|&s;ua&s;ion that I have wronged him. If he lives I may hope that he will one day be convinced of my innocence, and re&s;tore me to his e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Suffer me, madam, &s;aid I, to endeavour to merit yours; I implore your pardon for the&s;e &s;entiments I have dared to let you perceive. I was not able to prevent their birth, or to conceal them from you; I even know not whether I can &s;ubdue them, but I &s;wear to you that I will never importune you with them. I had taken a re&s;olution to fly from you, but your intere&s;t re|tains me here.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I confe&s;s to you, replied Madame de Bena|vides, that you have given me great unea&s;ine&s;s; Fortune &s;eemed de&s;irous of taking from me the con&s;olation I have found in your friend&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P>The tears &s;he &s;hed when &s;he &s;poke to me were more powerful than all the efforts of my rea&s;on; I was a&s;hamed of having augmented the mi&s;eries of one already &s;o unhappy.
<Q>No, madam, replied I, you &s;hall never be deprived of that friend&s;hip you have the goodne&s;s to &s;et &s;ome value upon; and I will endeavour to render my&s;elf worthy of yours, by my &s;olicitude to make you forget the extravagance I have been guilty of.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="626" REF="229">
<Q>In effect, when I left her, I found my&s;elf more calm and ea&s;y than I had ever been &s;ince I fir&s;t beheld her. Far from leaving her, I endeavour|ed, by the re&s;olutions I vowed to take when in her pre&s;ence, to furni&s;h my&s;elf with arguments for performing my duty. This method &s;ucceed|ed; I accu&s;tomed my&s;elf by degrees to reduce my former &s;entiments to friend&s;hip and e&s;teem: I told her ingenuou&s;ly the progre&s;s I made in my cure. She thanked me for it as for &s;ome con&s;ide|ble &s;ervice I had rendered her, and to reward me, gave me every day new marks of her con|fidence. Still my heart would &s;ometimes revolt, but rea&s;on always got the victory. My brother, after langui&s;hing a long time, at length began to recover: he would never be prevailed upon to give his wife permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee him, though &s;he often reque&s;ted it. He was not yet in a con|dition to leave his chamber, when Madame de Benavides fell ill in her turn. Her youth &s;aved her this time, and I was full of hope that her illne&s;s had &s;oftened her hu&s;band's heart; for though he had continued ob&s;tinately re&s;olute not to &s;ee her during his own danger, notwith|&s;tanding her earne&s;t entreaties, yet he &s;hewed &s;ome &s;olicitude in enquiring for her when &s;he was ill. She was almo&s;t recovered, when my bro|ther ordered me to be called to him.</Q></P>

<HEAD>TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED.</HEAD>

<HEAD>Indirect In&s;tructions, and that Children ought not to be urged.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, though we ought not to make a practice of threatning and never puni&s;hing, le&s;t our threats become contemptible, yet &s;hould not puni&s;h|ment be as often inflicted as threatned; and as to puni&s;hments, the pain ought to be as light as po&s;|&s;ible, but accompanied with all circum&s;tances that may affect the child with &s;hame and remor&s;e; for in&s;tance, &s;hew him what you have done to avoid coming to that extremity; appear concerned at it; &s;peak in his hearing of the misfortune of people that are &s;o wanting in rea&s;on and honour as to call for puni&s;hment; abate of your u&s;ual kindne&s;s, till you perceive he &s;tands in need of con&s;olation: let the puni&s;hment be either public or private, as you &s;hall judge it mo&s;t for his benefit, either to put him to great &s;hame, or to let him &s;ee that you choo&s;e to &s;pare him: let a public expo&s;ure be in re&s;erve for the la&s;t remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="628" REF="231">Sometimes make u&s;e of a di&s;creet per&s;on to comfort the child, and &s;ay &s;uch things to him as will not be proper for your&s;elf to &s;peak; one that may cure him of that fal&s;e &s;hame, and di&s;po&s;e him to &s;eek your favour; one to whom he may in his concern open his heart with more freedom than he can do in your pre&s;ence: but above all, let it ne|ver appear that you require aught more than the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; &s;o endeavour to manage that he &s;hall condemn him&s;elf, readily and freely, in|&s;omuch that it may be your part to mollify the pain he &s;hall have felt: the&s;e general rules may be em|ployed as each particular ca&s;e requires. Men, and more e&s;pecially, children, are not at all times the &s;ame; what is good for them to-day, will be dan|gerous to morrow: a conduct invariably uniform cannot be u&s;eful. The fewer formal le&s;&s;ons we make u&s;e of the better; a thou&s;and in&s;tructions more beneficial than what le&s;&s;ons afford, may be in|&s;inuated by the means of &s;prightly conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal children learn to read in di|verting them&s;elves; one need only relate &s;ome plea&s;ant &s;tories out of a book in their pre&s;ence, to teach them to know the letters in&s;en&s;ibly: after this they will of them&s;elves be eager to get at the &s;ource of what has given them &s;o much entertain|ment. There are two things which do great mi&s;|chief; one is, that they mu&s;t pre&s;ently be put to read in Latin, which robs them of all the plea&s;ure of reading; the other, that they are u&s;ed to read with a forced and ridiculous empha&s;is, or accent. It will be right to &s;upply them with a book hand|&s;omely bound, even gilt on the edges, with pretty
<PB N="629" REF="232">
figures in it, and of a good type. Whatever de|lights the fancy, is an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;tudy: endeavour to choo&s;e him one that &s;hall contain a number of &s;tories, &s;hort and &s;urpri&s;ing; this done, fear not but he will learn to read. Neither teaze him to do it exactly well: let him pronounce in his natural way as he &s;peaks, other tones are always bad, and ta&s;te of collegiate declamation. When in time, his tongue &s;hall be at liberty, his brea&s;t &s;tronger, and the habit of reading more enlarged, he will per|form it without trouble to him&s;elf, more gracefully, and more di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be taught to write nearly after the &s;ame method. When children know a little how to read, one may make it a diver&s;ion to them to form their letters, and where there are &s;everal of them, it is good to &s;tir up an emulation: they have a propen&s;ity to making figures upon paper; a&s;&s;i&s;t this inclination a little, without con&s;training them, and they will learn to form the letters by way of play, and by degrees come to write. One may al&s;o incite them, by propo&s;ing &s;ome kind of reward that &s;hall be agreeable to their ta&s;te, and innocent in its nature.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee you write a letter, one may &s;ay; ac|quaint your brother or your cou&s;in with that affair. All this plea&s;es the child, provided no frightful appearance of a &s;et ta&s;k comes to mole&s;t him. St. Au&s;tin &s;ays, upon his own experience, that a free curio&s;ity allowed, is a much greater in|citement to the &s;pirit of a child than formal rules and compul&s;ion derived from fear.</P>
<P><PB N="630" REF="233">There is one remarkable and great fault in the cour&s;e of common education; that is, all the plea&s;ure is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie on one &s;ide, all the pain on the other; in &s;tudy all the pain, in diver&s;ion all the plea&s;ure. What will a child naturally do but be impatient under the pre&s;cribed rule, and run eagerly to his diver&s;ion? therefore let us try to change the order of the&s;e things, and make ap|plication agreeable under the di&s;gui&s;e of liberty and plea&s;ure: let us &s;uffer them to break off in little &s;allies of play. The&s;e interruptions are nece&s;&s;ary in order to refre&s;h their minds; let their eyes wander a while; let them digre&s;s or trifle a little to di&s;en|cumber them&s;elves, and after that we may gently bring them back to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To require an uninterupted application to their &s;tudies does them a great deal of mi&s;chief: it is common for governors to affect this exact regu|larity, becau&s;e it is more for their ea&s;e and con|veniency than to be obliged to lie in watch for the more &s;erviceable moments. At the &s;ame time, what|ever diver&s;ions we allow them, let us &s;ee they are &s;uch as have not the lea&s;t tendency to throw them into pa&s;&s;ions; whatever will refre&s;h the mind, or afford an agreeable variety, or plea&s;e their curio&s;ity in u&s;eful &s;ubjects, or practi&s;e their limbs in any commendable art, that is the proper matter of children's diver&s;ions; and they are be&s;t plea&s;ed with &s;uch as con&s;i&s;t of bodily motion, &s;o they do but change place, a &s;huttle-cock, a bowl, is enough. Neither need we be at much trouble about what will plea&s;e them, for they will invent for them&s;elves. It is &s;ufficient to let them proceed their own way,
<PB N="631" REF="234">
to look on with a plea&s;ant countenance, and to in|terpo&s;e when they &s;eem to grow too warm.</P>
<P>It would be good to give them a notion, &s;o far as they will receive it, of the plea&s;ures which the under&s;tanding affords, as conver&s;ation, news, hi|&s;tories, and divers games of application that con|tain &s;ome in&s;truction, All this will have its u&s;e in time; but we mu&s;t not force a ta&s;te for the&s;e things: we mu&s;t only make them the offer; the time will come when their bodies will be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to motion, their minds more active. In the mean time the care we &s;hall take care to &s;ea&s;on employments of a &s;erious nature with the reli&s;h of plea&s;ure, will be a great means to abate the propen&s;ity of youth to dangerous entertainments. It is &s;ubjection and unea&s;ine&s;s that excite &s;uch an impatience for di|ver&s;ion; where a girl is not unea&s;y in her mother's pre&s;ence &s;he will have no &s;uch violent de&s;ire to get away, and look out for wor&s;e company.</P>
<P>As to the choice of diver&s;ions, all &s;ociety capable of doing harm is to be avoided. No boys among girls, nor even girls that have not an orderly turn of mind. All plays that are apt to di&s;&s;ipate or tran&s;port the thoughts, or that accu&s;tom the body to ge&s;tures unbecoming a girl; all frequent excur&s;ions from home, and all conver&s;ations likely to excite a de|&s;ire of &s;uch excur&s;ions, are to be avoided carefully.</P>
<P>So long as we continue unprejudiced by any high entertainment, &s;o long as no violent pa&s;&s;ions have &s;prung up in us, we are ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of delight. Health and innocence will produce it; for they are true &s;ources of it: whereas, they who have unfortunately been habituated to the perceptions
<PB N="632" REF="235">
of violent plea&s;ures, lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e for more mode|rate ones, and fret them&s;elves in a perpetual un|ea&s;y &s;earch after joy.</P>
<P>Our ta&s;te for entertainment is &s;poiled, as is our ta&s;te for victuals; we &s;o accu&s;tom our&s;elves to things of a quick reli&s;h, that ordinary meats and plain, become flat and in&s;ipid. Let us then be fearful of tho&s;e &s;trong &s;en&s;ations which are but pre|parations to unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t; they are more e&s;pecially to be feared for children, who are le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t what they feel, and love to be affected: let us keep them in the ta&s;te for plain things, no high &s;ea&s;oned food for their &s;upport, nor enter|tainments for their delight. Sobriety it&s;elf ever be&s;tows &s;ufficient appetite, without the provocation of &s;auces, which betray us to intemperance. A certain antient hath &s;aid, The very be&s;t artificer of plea&s;ure is temperance; that temperance which is the health both of body and mind, under who&s;e influence we feel our&s;elves in a &s;tate of gentle and moderate delight, without wanting the contrivance of machinery, or public &s;hows, or expence for its production. A game of our own invention, a book, &s;ome ta&s;k undertaken, a plea&s;ant walk, an innocent conver&s;ation, as a refre&s;hment after we have been employed, afford a more pure perception of delight than the fine&s;t concert of mu&s;ick.</P>

PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Natural Hi&s;tory of the EPHEMERON, or DAY-FLY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more trite and common than the ridicule which per&s;ons unu&s;ed to the &s;tudy of nature endeavour to throw on tho&s;e whom a more &s;peculative turn of mind induces to follow her into her inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es, and examine even into the extreme&s;t minutiae of her works. The titles of gimcrack, cockle-&s;hell merchant, fly hunter, &amp;c. are lavi&s;hly be&s;towed on them by &s;uch as either ignorance, indolence, or a natural want of curi|o&s;ity, have excluded from the great garden of na|ture: they find no amu&s;ement or in&s;truction in a box of cockle-&s;hells, a bundle of weeds, or a clu&s;ter of caterpillars (for &s;o in general terms are all the objects of natural enquiry &s;tiled by them) and there|fore conclude that neither is capable of being drawn from them; and con&s;equently,
<Q>to what u&s;e is all this,</Q>
is ever their general cry.</P>
<P><PB N="634" REF="238">But the real philo&s;opher, the man of clear re|flection, and accurate di&s;cernment, who traver&s;es every path, and explores every winding of this re|gular wilderne&s;s, will meet not only with entertain|ment, but al&s;o with great improvement from every object that he &s;ees. Each &s;tep he takes a text pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, from which his genius may draw out a &s;ermon of admirable &s;ervice to his fellow-creatures. Nor can the apparent in&s;ignificance of the &s;ubjects in them&s;elves render the le&s;&s;on they convey the le&s;s important, but quite the contrary. For if in the minute&s;t animals we perceive the care and wi&s;dom of an infinite power exerted for their formation and protection; if we perceive them endued with all tho&s;e faculties which are or can be nece&s;&s;ary for their pre&s;ervation, and tho&s;e faculties even mo&s;t punctually employed to the purpo&s;es for which they were intended; with what an awe and adoration ought it to turn our thoughts towards the great Creator of them all! with what gratitude &s;hould it in&s;pire our hearts for him who has &s;till &s;o much more taken care for us, and be&s;towed on us faculties and powers &s;o greatly &s;uperior to the re&s;t of his creatures! and la&s;tly, with how much &s;elf-reproach &s;hould it fill us when we con&s;ider that from a mi&s;|application of tho&s;e powers we &s;o frequently defeat the all-wi&s;e de&s;igns of heaven, and even render them more fallible than the uncorrupted in&s;tinct even of the &s;malle&s;t reptile!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is no object from which the &s;pe|culative man may not deduce a le&s;&s;on, or on which he may not moralize with advantage. Nay, u&s;e|le&s;s as the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory may now appear to the unlearned, yet let them &s;eriou&s;ly reflect from
<PB N="635" REF="239">
whence they have acquired &s;ome of their mo&s;t va|luable improvements, to whom they &s;tand indebted for their mo&s;t u&s;eful arts, and they will find them owing to ob&s;ervations of this kind made by men in the more early periods of the world; and that the greate&s;t part of that genius which man &s;o proudly boa&s;ts of is very little more than the noticed in&s;tinct of other animals improved upon by his own rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To in&s;tance only in a very few examples.&mdash;Who taught us the art of building but the beaver? who that of &s;pinning but the &s;ilk worm? of weaving but the &s;pider? of navigation but the nautilus? are not the faculties of the mind al&s;o greatly to be improved by ob&s;ervation of other animals? can the nece&s;&s;ity of regular &s;ubordination and &s;trictne&s;s of government be better pointed out than in that of the bees? do not the ants in&s;truct us in indu&s;try and frugality? or can we ob&s;erve the lion-pi&s;mire without being taught a noble le&s;&s;on of patience and per&s;everance?</P>
<P>But if reflection and moral contemplation are to be &s;ought for in the&s;e re&s;earches, what object offers an ampler &s;cope for them than the animal which I am now going to introduce to the acquaintance of my fair readert? for what can po&s;&s;ibly afford a more ju&s;t idea of the real value of time, and the nece&s;&s;ity of employing every moment of it to the be&s;t ad|vantage, than the ob&s;erving a creature who&s;e whole allotted period of life is no more than the &s;pace of five hours, and that in the general not half at|tained to, but cut off in the middle by &s;ome in|&s;idious enemy who lies in wait to de&s;troy it?</P>
<P><PB N="636" REF="240">This fly (for in the fly-&s;tate only is it to be con&s;i|dered in this view) is called by the authors who have written concerning it by the names of the ephemeron, hemerobios, and diaria; all which mean no more than an animal of but a &s;ingle day's exi&s;tence. It is a native of Germany, and appears every year for about three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, flutter|ing on the &s;urface of the water at the mouths of the Rhine, the Meu&s;e, the Wael, the Leck, and the Y&s;el, about the middle of June. But this continued appearance of them is kept up by a re|gular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for tho&s;e who begin to live and flutter about towards the noon of the fir&s;t day are dead before night, a new &s;et makes its appearance on the &s;econd, and the third in like manner is &s;up|plied by a fre&s;h generation. After which no more of them are to be &s;een, till the &s;ucceeding year re|news this three day's phaenomenon.</P>
<P>Altho' the life of the ephemeron in its fly-&s;tate, which we &s;hall more particularly dwell on here|after, is &s;o extremely &s;hort, yet as it has an ex|i&s;tence under another form, and in another element, which continues through a &s;pace of three years, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould dwell a little on its hi&s;tory during that period, and relate the manner of its &s;everal changes.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, although this animal, when arrived at the &s;tate of full perfection, is an enlivened flutterer of the airy regions, yet his original exi&s;tence is in the waters, where the eggs being depo&s;ited by the female, aed impregnated by the male, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;pawn of fi&s;hes, are &s;cattered over the muddy bottoms of the rivers by the motion of the water, and there depo&s;ited in that bed, which
<PB N="637" REF="241">
is the mo&s;t proper for their being hatched and brought into life.</P>
<P>As the&s;e eggs are not united together by any glutinous or gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance, nor depo&s;ited in clu&s;ters as the &s;pawn of the frog, of the water|&s;nail, and of &s;everal other in&s;ects, but entirely di&s;per&s;ed and &s;eparate from each other, it is no very ea&s;y matter to a&s;certain how long it is before the in&s;ect contained within them acquires life, and breaks through its &s;helly integument. It is &s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve, that after a certain period they produce a little worm, with &s;ix legs, which at one year's growth is of the &s;ize and form repre&s;ented in the annexed plate, at Fig. I. At this age it is not only without wings, or tho&s;e prominences which cover the wings, but al&s;o without the lea&s;t &s;igns or ve&s;tiges of any &s;uch part. When they come to be two years old, the little &s;heaths of the wings ap|pear very plainly; and the animal, then very great|ly enlarged in bulk, appeas as at Fig. II. And when it has reached its third year, at which time it is to undergo its grand metamorpho&s;is, the&s;e ca&s;es are then as con&s;picuous as po&s;&s;ible, re&s;embling a little flower that increa&s;es by degrees, and is ready to break out of its cup. Its appearance is then &s;uch as is &s;hewn in Fig. III.</P>
<P>This animal is made great u&s;e of by the fi&s;her|men, by whom it is called by the name of bank|bait: for although they can &s;wim very &s;wiftly, yet it is &s;eldom that they do &s;o, but are always found near the banks of rivers, and there live in the mo&s;t quiet parts. The more mud there is at the bottom out of which they fir&s;t ri&s;e, the greater number of the worms are u&s;ually to be met
<PB N="638" REF="242">
with. Yet are they very rarely to be found either lying on the mud or adhering to it; but they live within the mud or clay it&s;elf, in hollows made ob|long and &s;mooth, and which they con&s;tantly bore, not obliquely or perpendicularly, but ever parallel to the hori&s;on, each &s;everal animal living in a &s;epa|rate cell.</P>
<P>The worm of the ephemeron as &s;oon as it hatched from the egg, prepares for the building of the&s;e cells or hou&s;es, which they make larger and larger as the &s;ize of their body increa&s;es; &s;o that the full grown worms are always to be found in larger, the younger in &s;maller tubes. For this purpo&s;e nature has furni&s;hed them with parts particularly adapted thereto, their two fore-legs being formed in &s;ome mea&s;ure like tho&s;e of the mole, or mole cricket, and their jaws furni&s;hed with two teeth, &s;omewhat like the forcipes or claws of crabs, which are of great &s;ervice to their making their way into the mud.</P>
<P>If you throw &s;ome of them into a little mud mixed with water, you will in&s;tantly perceive them begin this work of piercing and boring; and if the quantity of mud you give them is not &s;ufficient en|tirely to immerge them, they will neverthele&s;s continue to undermine what they have, hiding at one time their heads, at another their bodies, and at others their tails, in the attempt to form new cells.</P>
<P>In the&s;e cells then the worm of the ephemeron continues, till the time when it is to undergo its final metamorpho&s;is, which as I have before ob|&s;erved is at the period of three years; previous to which the ca&s;es of the wings appear very protube|rant
<PB N="639" REF="243">
on the back, the &s;mooth, and depre&s;&s;ed form of the upper part of the body is changed into a more &s;wollen and rounder &s;hape, and the wings them&s;elves become in &s;ome degree vi&s;ible through their external &s;kin.</P>
<P>At the time that this metamorpho&s;is is to begin, which is generally about &s;ix o'clock in the evening, the worm quits his cell, and goes into the water, from the bottom of which he immediately makes all the expedition he can to the &s;urface, and there fixing on any thing &s;olid that he can meet with, ei|ther wood, &s;tone, earth, a tree, a boat, a bea&s;t, or a man, all appearing equally indifferent to him, he appears to be &s;eized all over with a &s;huddering or trembling motion, when immediately the &s;kin opens on the middle of the back, the &s;lit enlarging towards the fore parts, till it becomes &s;o wide, that the animal is able to thru&s;t his head out at it; after which he draws his legs al&s;o out of the &s;kin, as in Fig. IV. whil&s;t the claws, adhering to the ca&s;t skin, are in the mean time firmly fixed in their places, which greatly contributes towards enabling him to &s;lip the re&s;t of his body out of its covering. It mu&s;t moreover be ob&s;erved that the head and legs are &s;tript of their skin in the &s;ame manner that we draw our feet out of our &s;hoes; but that as to the other parts, that is to &s;ay the fir&s;t and &s;econd pair of wings, the skin is drawn off from them in &s;uch a manner as that they become turned in&s;ide out, as we invert a limber pair of gloves, the in|ward &s;urface or in&s;ide of the fingers being pulled out; &s;o that the exuvium, or ca&s;e which is left be|hind, bears the form repre&s;ented at Fig. V.</P>
<P><PB N="640" REF="244">When it has thus quitted its ca&s;e, and con&s;e|quently compleated its change, it appears a per|fect fly, with two pair of very fine filmy wings, as at Fig. VI. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Plate referred to will be given in our Next.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this period then may be dated the com|mencement of its life, the whole duration of which afterwards is never more than about five hours, in which &s;hort &s;pace it generates, lays eggs, grows old, and dies. &mdash;That is to &s;ay if it even reaches to the extent of that very &s;hort allotted &s;pace; for &s;hort as it is, it is frequently cut off before the conclu&s;ion of it by the means of &s;ome of the very numerous enemies whereby this innocent unhappy little creature is per&s;ecuted in the cour&s;e of it. Fond as it were of the element from whence he &s;prung, no &s;ooner is his change compleated, than he in&s;tantly repairs to it again, and flutters towards its &s;urface, where if he ventures too near, he becomes an ea&s;y prey to the trout, and many other kinds of fi&s;h, who watch to take him, and to whom he is a mo&s;t delicious mor&s;el; and if he &s;oars higher into the air, he is as liable to be &s;napp'd up by the birds, who are no le&s;s fond of him. They frequently even &s;eize and devour him whil&s;t he is engaged in the great work of changing his skin; nay, numbers of the worms are de&s;troyed by the inhabitants of the waters, in their very birth, before they can reach the &s;urface to become the tenants of a purer element.</P>
<P>Such, &s;o &s;hort, and &s;o full of peril is the life of this harmle&s;s little in&s;ect; and &s;uch, O man! is thine!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mrs. TRIFLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Cannot help &s;u&s;pecting that you art|fully mean to cajole your fair readers into &s;en&s;e and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and that you only bait your periodical labours with a Trifler merely to captivate our attention, while you mean nothing le&s;s than our acquaintance with all u&s;eful and polite literature. Notwith&s;tanding this pretty &s;tratagem of yours, which is like teach|ing children their letters by gingerbread alphabets, we are re&s;olved to di&s;appoint your endeavours, and the purpo&s;e of this letter is to inform you of the very pernicious con&s;equences which mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily re&s;ult from your projected reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="642" REF="246">There is one general argument which has always appeared to me unan&s;werable upon this &s;ubject: if we poor women furni&s;hed our minds with moral and hi&s;torical truth, and took pains to acquire the true principles of ta&s;te and critici&s;m, we &s;hould be very apt upon this &s;uppo&s;ition to di&s;cern the defi|ciencies of our admirers in the&s;e articles; and from a total di&s;&s;imilitude of manners and pur&s;uits, grow quickly di&s;gu&s;ted at each other, and &s;o ri&s;k our e&s;tabli&s;hments for the &s;ake of accompli&s;hments no longer re&s;pected.</P>
<P>Pray, madam, have you ever known any ladies advantageou&s;ly &s;ettled in life on account of their mental qualifications, where the metallic charms were wanting? I que&s;tion extremely whether even a precedent could be found for &s;o irregular a pro|ceeding, &s;o true it is what the poet &s;ings.</P>
<Q>Wit mu&s;t wear the willow with the bays.</Q>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you entirely mi&s;take the point; a woman of knowledge is at pre&s;ent no object of reque&s;t, and I am afraid literature, like virtue, is in&s;ufficient for its own reward&mdash;&s;o well &s;atisfied is the whole tribe of Triflers of this maxim, that there is not one of them who would not rather endanger their health and impair their &s;ight by needle-work, than read ten pages of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, or acquaint them&s;elves with the very rudiments of the religion of their country.</P>
<P>Your ladies of literature were commonly &s;u&s;cep|tible of tenderne&s;s, (for I have looked into a tran|&s;lation of Ovid's Epi&s;tles,) and this is a quality the Triflers have totally dive&s;ted them&s;elves of. I &s;up|po&s;e

you would endeavour, by enlarging our ideas, to &s;often and refine our affections, but that would be the mo&s;t unfortunate thing in the world for us, for I can a&s;&s;ure you, we have already more light in our minds than is friendly to our pur&s;uits and de|&s;ires, and we are not a little incommoded by its impertinent &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>You know that our whole family has a mortal antipathy to every thing that is &s;evere and formal, and I have been told that <HI>method and attention</HI> are very nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the proper fruit of &s;tudy and application: now, as to the method, we are utter &s;trangers to it, and we have never been ac|cu&s;tomed to be&s;tow the lea&s;t attention upon any thing but the adorning and exhibiting our dear per&s;ons&mdash;not that we are &s;o aver&s;e to letters, as to|tally to neglect every &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, but we manage that affair in &s;o compendious and plea&s;|ing a manner, that it becomes a mere amu&s;ement. Me&s;&s;age-cards afford us a great deal of employ|ment; nor are there wanting very elegant models of that pretty &s;tile of writing.</P>
<P>There is a judicious gentleman in this town who adverti&s;es to teach all &s;orts of penman&s;hip in a very few hours, the Italian hand in nineteen hours, and in proportion all the re&s;t; I am credibly informed, that, in imitation of &s;o worthy an original, there is a lady very &s;hortly expected here from Bru&s;&s;els, who will undertake to teach French in a fortnight, hi&s;tory in &s;ixteen hours, morality in half an hour, and religion in a quarter of an hour.</P>

<P><Q>My dear benefactor is ill, &s;aid &s;he, and has none but &s;trangers about him: it is fit that I &s;hould go and attend him; and if I mu&s;t lo&s;e him, pur&s;ued &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears, it will be &s;ome comfort to me to reflect that I have done my duty.</Q></P>
<P>She &s;et out early the next, morning in the &s;tage-coach: Dolly wept at parting, and engaged her lover to attend Sophia to her journey's end; that if Mr. Herbert &s;hould be wor&s;e than they appre|hended, he might be near to a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort her.</P>
<P>Sophia, when &s;he &s;aw him riding by the &s;ide of the coach, attempted to per&s;uade him to return; but William charmed to have an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his zeal for her &s;ervice, would not quit her; and her &s;pirits being too weak to conte&s;t this point with him, &s;he was obliged to &s;uffer his at|tendance.</P>
<P>They reached the place where Mr. Herbert was, in the evening of the third day: he had taken
<PB N="647" REF="253">
lodgings at the hou&s;e, of a farmer, where he was attended with great tenderne&s;s and care.</P>
<P>Sophia, appeared with &s;o deep a concern upon her countenance, and enquired for him with &s;uch extreme emotion, that the good woman of the hou&s;e concluding &s;he was his daughter, thought it nece&s;|&s;ary before &s;he an&s;wered her que&s;tions, to preach patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her, wi&s;ely ob&s;erving, that we are all mortal, and that death &s;pares no|body, from the &s;quire to the plowman.</P>
<P>She ran on in this manner till &s;he perceived Sophia grow as pale as death, and clo&s;e her eyes: &s;he had ju&s;t time to prevent her from falling, and with William's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, placed her in a chair, where while &s;he applied remedies to recover her from her &s;woon, the youth with tears in his eyes, a&s;ked her &s;oftly how long Mr. Herbert had been dead.</P>
<P><Q>Dead! repeated the farmer's wife, who told you he was dead? no, no, it is not &s;o bad as that neither.</Q></P>
<P>William rejoiced to hear this, and as &s;oon as Sophia &s;hewed &s;ome &s;igns of returning life, he greeted her with the welcome, news. She ca&s;t a look full of doubt and angui&s;h upon the country|woman, who confirmed his report, and offered to go with her to the gentleman's room. Sophia in&s;tantly found her &s;trength return; &s;he fol|lowed her with trembling ha&s;te; and, left her pre&s;ence &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e Mr. Herbert, &s;he directed the good woman to tell him, that a friend of his was come to &s;ee him.</P>
<P><PB N="648" REF="254">She heard him an&s;wer in a weak voice, but with &s;ome emotion, "It is my dear child, bring her to me."</P>
<P>Sophia immediately appeared, and throwing her|&s;elf upon her knees at his bed-&s;ide, bur&s;t into tears, and was unable to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The good old man holding one of her hands pre&s;t in his, tenderly blamed her for the trouble &s;he had given her&s;elf in coming &s;o far to vi&s;it him; but acknowledged at the &s;ame time, that this in|&s;tance of her affection was extremely dear to him, and that her pre&s;ence gave him inexpre&s;&s;ible comfort.</P>
<P>Sophia entered immediately upon the office of a nur&s;e to her benefactor, and performed all the du|ties of the mo&s;t affectionate child to the be&s;t of parents.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert employed the little remaining &s;trength he had in endeavours to comfort her, and in pious exhortations.
<Q>Weep not for me, my dear child, would he &s;ay, but rather rejoice that the innocence of my life has diverted death of his terrors, and enabled me to meet him with calm re&s;ignation, and with humble hope. At this awful hour how little would it avail me, that I had been rich, that I had been great and powerful? but what comforts do I not feel from an unreproving con&s;cience? the&s;e comforts every one has it in his power to procure; live virtuous then, my dear Sophia, that you may die in peace: how &s;mall is the difference between the longe&s;t and the &s;horte&s;t life! if its plea&s;ures be few, its mi&s;eries are &s;o likewi&s;e; how little do they enjoy whom the world calls happy! how little
<PB N="649" REF="255">
do they &s;uffer whom it pronounces wretched! one point of fleeting time pa&s;t, and death reduces all to an equality. But the di&s;tinction between virtue and vice, and its future happine&s;s and mi&s;ery are eternal.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia had need of all the con&s;olation &s;he de|rived from her reflections on the virtue and piety of her friend, to enable her to bear the apprehen&s;ions of his approaching death with any degree of for|titude; but when &s;he lea&s;t expected it, his di&s;tem|per took a favourable turn, and in a few days the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms were removed.</P>
<P>The Bath waters being judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for the entire ree&s;tabli&s;hment of his health, he re&s;olved to go thither as &s;oon as he had recovered &s;trength enough to bear the journey.</P>
<P>Sophia at his earne&s;t de&s;ire con&s;ented to return to Mr. Law&s;on's, and remain there till he came from Bath, but &s;he would not quit him till he was able to take this journey; and by the &s;weetne&s;s of her con|ver&s;ation, her tender a&s;&s;iduity, and watchful care, contributed &s;o much towards his recovery, that he was &s;oon in a condition to travel with &s;afety.</P>
<P>He accompanied her the fir&s;t day's journey to Mr. Law&s;on's; and being met at the inn by this worthy friend and young William, he con&s;igned his beloved charge to their care, and pur&s;ued his way to Bath.</P>
<P>Sophia was received with great joy by Mrs. Law|&s;on and her daughters: Dolly hung a long time upon her neck in tran&s;ports, and as &s;oon as they were alone, informed her that Mrs. Gibbons and her mother were perfectly reconciled; that &s;he had
<PB N="650" REF="256">
con&s;ented to her nephew's marriage, and even &s;hewed an impatience to conclude it: but I pre|vailed, &s;aid &s;he, to have the ceremony delayed till you, my dear friend, could be pre&s;ent; for I could not think of being happy, while, you to whom I owe all, was afflicted.</P>
<P>Sophia embraced her tenderly, congratulated her upon her change of fortune, and gave many prai&s;es to her lover, to whom &s;he acknowledged great ob|ligations for his care and attention to her.</P>
<P>Dolly's cheeks glowed with plea&s;ure while &s;he heard her William commended by one whom &s;he &s;o much loved and revered.</P>
<P>The young lovers were married a few days af|terwards; and Sophia, who had &s;o earne&s;tly en|deavoured to bring about this union, and had &s;uf|fered &s;o much in her own intere&s;t by her &s;olicitude concerning it, was one of tho&s;e to whom it gave the mo&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mean time Mr. Herbert continued indi&s;po&s;ed at Bath, and Sophia unea&s;y, left in this increa&s;e of his expences, her re&s;idence at Mr. Law&s;on's &s;hould lay him under &s;ome difficulties, re&s;olved to ea&s;e him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible of the charge of her main|tenance: &s;he explained her &s;ituation to Mrs. Gib|bons, and reque&s;ted her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring her a place.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons expre&s;&s;ed great tenderne&s;s and concern for her upon this occa&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would employ all her intere&s;t in her &s;ervice. She accordingly mentioned her with great prai&s;e to a widow lady of a very affluent fortune, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a character for genero&s;ity and
<PB N="651" REF="257">
goodne&s;s, that &s;he hoped if &s;he could be induced to take Sophia under her protection her fortune would be made.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, &s;o was the lady called, no &s;ooner heard that a young woman of merit, well born, and genteely educated was reduced to go to &s;er|vice for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than &s;he exclaimed with great vehemence again&s;t the avarice and luxury of the rich and great, who either hoarded for their un|thankful heirs, or lavi&s;hed in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures tho&s;e &s;uperfluous &s;ums which ought to be applied to the relief of the indigent.
<Q>Oh that I had a fortune, cried &s;he, as large as my heart, there &s;hould not be one di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;on in the world! I mu&s;t &s;ee this young lady Mrs. Gibbons, and I mu&s;t do &s;omething for her. You have obliged me infinitely by putting it in my power to gra|tify the unbounded benevolence of my heart upon a de&s;erving object.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Gibbons, when &s;he related this conver&s;a|tion to Sophia, filled her with an extreme impa|tience to &s;ee the lady, not from any mean con&s;ide|rations of advantage to her&s;elf, but admiration of &s;o excellent a character. She accompanied Mrs. Gibbons in a vi&s;it to her at her country-&s;eat, which was but a few miles di&s;tant from the village where they lived; and Mrs. Howard was &s;o plea&s;ed with her at this fir&s;t interview, that &s;he gave her an invitation to &s;pend the remainder of the &s;ummer with her, and this in &s;o obliging a manner, that Sophia immediately complied, not thinking it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to wait till &s;he had con&s;ulted Mr. Herbert upon this offer, as &s;he was fully per&s;uaded he could
<PB N="652" REF="258">
have no objections to her accepting it, Mrs. Howard being &s;o con&s;iderable by her family and fortune, and &s;o e&s;timable by her character.</P>
<P>This lady, who had made an early di&s;covery of Sophia's economical talents, &s;et her to work im|mediately after her arrival; her ta&s;k was to embroider a white &s;attin negligee, which &s;he undertook with great readine&s;s, plea&s;ed at having an opportunity of obliging a woman of &s;o generous a di&s;po&s;ition, and in &s;ome degree to requite her for her ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard indeed always prevented tho&s;e on whom &s;he conferred favours from incurring the guilt of ingratitude; for &s;he took care to be fully repaid for any act of benevolence; and having a wonderful art in extracting advantage to her&s;elf from the nece&s;&s;ities of others, &s;he &s;ometimes &s;ought out the unfortunate with a &s;olicitude that did great honour to her charity, which was &s;ure to be its own reward. A few o&s;tentatious benefactions had &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed her character; and while her name appeared among the &s;ub&s;cribers to &s;ome fa&s;hionable charity, who could &s;u&s;pect that her table was &s;erved with a par&s;imony which would have di&s;graced a much &s;maller fortune; that her rents from her indigent tenants were exacted with the mo&s;t unrelenting rigor, and the naked and hungry &s;ent &s;ighing from her gate?</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than what is called libe|rality is often no more than the vanity of giving, of which &s;ome per&s;ons are fonder than of what they give. But the vanity of giving publicly is mo&s;t prevailing; and hence it happens, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t ce|lebrated
<PB N="653" REF="259">
for their charity, are in reality lea&s;t &s;en|&s;ible to the feelings of humanity: and the &s;ame per&s;ons from whom the mo&s;t affecting repre&s;en|tation of private di&s;tre&s;s could not force the lea&s;t relief, have been among the fir&s;t to &s;end their con|tributions to any new foundation.</P>
<P>Sophia knew not how to reconcile many circum|&s;tances in Mrs. Howard's conduct, with her general profe&s;&s;ions of benevolence and genero&s;ity; but that lady had been &s;o u&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf to others, that at la&s;t &s;he did not know her&s;elf; and the warmth and vehemence with which &s;he delivered her &s;entiments impo&s;ed almo&s;t as much upon her|&s;elf as her hearers.</P>
<P>Sophia's amiable qualities however &s;oon produced their u&s;ual effects, and in&s;pired Mrs. Howard with as much friend&s;hip for her as &s;o intere&s;ted a tem|per was capable of. She wi&s;hed to &s;ee her fortune e&s;tabli&s;hed, and was very de&s;irous of &s;erving her as far as &s;he could, con&s;i&s;tent with her prudent maxims, which were to make other per&s;ons the &s;ource of tho&s;e benefits, the merit of which &s;he arro|gated to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Chance &s;oon furni&s;hed her with an opportunity of exerting her talents in favour of Sophia, and of engaging, as &s;he conceived, her eternal gratitude. A country lady of her acquaintance coming one day to vi&s;it her, with her &s;on, a clowni&s;h igno|rant youth, Mrs. Howard was encouraged by the frequent glances he gave Sophia, to form a &s;cheme for marrying her to him; and in this &s;he fore&s;aw &s;o many po&s;&s;ible advantages to
<PB N="654" REF="260">
her&s;elf from Sophia's grateful di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;he pur&s;ued it with the mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>Mr. Barton, &s;o was the young &s;quire called, having conceived a liking for Sophia, repeated his vi&s;its frequently, emboldened by Mrs. Howard's civilities, who took every occa&s;ion of prai&s;ing So|phia, and in&s;inuating that he would be extremely happy in &s;uch a wife.</P>
<P>She &s;ometimes left him alone with Sophia, in hopes that he would declare his pa&s;&s;ion to her: but the ru&s;tic, awed by the dignity of her per&s;on and manners, dur&s;t not even rai&s;e his eyes to look on her; &s;o that Mrs. Howard finding the affair did not advance &s;o fa&s;t as &s;he wi&s;hed, rallied Sophia upon her: ill-timed re&s;erve, and hinted her views in her favour, which &s;he con&s;idering as an effect of her friend&s;hip, li&s;tened to with re&s;pect and even grati|tude, though her heart refu&s;ed to concur in them.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Howard's only &s;on, a youth about nineteen, who had come from the univer&s;ity to pa&s;s a few days with his mother. As &s;oon as &s;he had quitted So|phia he approached her, and with a look of tender|ne&s;s and concern, told her,
<Q>He was &s;orry to find his mother &s;o zealous an advocate for Mr. Barton, who could not po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor can I po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve him, replied Sophia with a &s;mile; he is too rich.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Love only and merit can de&s;erve you, re&s;umed the young &s;tudent, &s;ighing, and if love was merit, I know one who might&mdash;hope&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>He pau&s;ed and he&s;itated, and Sophia, to whom the language of love in any mouth but Sir Charles's
<PB N="655" REF="261">
was odious, &s;uddenly quitted him, to avoid the con|tinuance of a di&s;cour&s;e which &s;he con&s;idered as mere unmeaning gallantry.</P>
<P>Mean time, her ru&s;tic lover not having courage enough to declare his pa&s;&s;ion to her, had recour&s;e to the indulgence of his mother, who till that time had never refu&s;ed any of his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>He told her that he never liked any young wo|man &s;o well in his life as Mrs. Sophia Darnley; and that he was &s;ure &s;he would make a good wife, be|cau&s;e Mrs. Howard had told him &s;o, and encou|raged him to break his mind to her, but he was a&s;hamed: he declared he would marry no body el&s;e, and begged his mother to get her for him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barton, full of rage again&s;t her neighbour, for thus endeavouring to en&s;nare her &s;on into a marriage, as &s;he conceived unworthy of him, re|&s;olved to go to her and load her with reproaches. While her chariot was getting ready, &s;he continued to que&s;tion her &s;on, and heard a great many par|ticulars from him which convinced her that his af|fections were more deeply engaged than &s;he had imagined.</P>
<P>After ordering the young &s;quire to be locked up till her return, &s;he flew to Mrs. Howard, and with the mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of rage, upbraided her with the treacherous part &s;he had acted, by &s;educing her &s;on into a liking for a poor creature who was a dependent upon her charity, and whom &s;he took this method to get rid of.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, who held Mrs. Barton in great contempt, on account of her ignorance, and va|lued her&s;elf extremely upon her philo&s;ophic com|mand
<PB N="656" REF="262">
over her pa&s;&s;ions, li&s;tened with an affected calmne&s;s to all Mrs. Barton's invectives; and when &s;he found &s;he had railed her&s;elf out of breath, &s;he began to declaim in a &s;olemn accent again&s;t ava|rice, and that vile and fordid di&s;po&s;ition of parents, who in the marriage of their children preferred the dro&s;s of riches to the real trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and virtue. She very charitably lamented Mrs. Barton's want of di&s;cernment, and littlene&s;s of mind; and concluded that Mi&s;s Sophia's, merit rendered her de&s;erving of a hu&s;band even more con&s;iderable than Mr. Barton.</P>
<P><Q>Then marry her to your own &s;on, replied Mrs. Barton, with a &s;neer; no doubt but he will be more worthy of her.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If my &s;on &s;hould declare a pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Sophia, re&s;umed Mrs. Howard, it would &s;oon be &s;een how far my &s;entiments are exalted above yours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am glad to hear this, returned Mrs. Barton, for I am very &s;ure Mr. Howard is in love with this wonderful creature whom you prai&s;e &s;o much; and &s;ince you are &s;o willing to make her your daughter-in-law, I &s;hall be under no fear of my &s;on's marrying her.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, at this unexpected &s;troke, turned as pale as death, and with a faultering voice, a&s;ked her,
<Q>What rea&s;on &s;he had for &s;uppo&s;ing her &s;on was in love with Mi&s;s Sophia?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Barton, who enjoyed her perplexity and con|fu&s;ion, &s;uffered her to repeat her que&s;tions &s;everal times, and then maliciou&s;ly referred her to the young gentleman him&s;elf,
<Q>Who, &s;aid &s;he, upon
<PB N="657" REF="263">
finding you &s;o favourably di&s;po&s;ed, will, I doubt not, be ready enough to own his inclinations.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard was now &s;o far humbled, that &s;he conde&s;cended to intreat Mrs. Barton to tell her what &s;he knew of this affair.</P>
<P><Q>All my information, &s;aid Mrs. Barton, comes from my &s;on, to whom Mr. Howard, con&s;idering him as his rival, declared his better right to the lady, as having acquainted her with his pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>At this intelligence Mrs. Howards rage got &s;o much the better of her prudence, that &s;he uttered a thou&s;and invectives again&s;t the innocent Sophia, which drew &s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms from Mrs. Barton, who being now fully revenged, ro&s;e up to be gone; but Mrs. Howard, &s;en&s;ible that a quarrel upon this occa&s;ion might have con&s;equences very unfavour|able to her reputation, &s;eized her hand, and led her half reluctant, again to her chair, where, after &s;he had &s;oothed her into good humour, by &s;ome flattering expre&s;&s;ions, which coming from one of her acknowledged under&s;tanding, had great weight. She told her with the mo&s;t unblu&s;hing confidence, that &s;he was now convinced &s;he had been deceived in the character of the young woman on whom &s;he had with her u&s;ual genero&s;ity conferred &s;o many benefits.
<Q>I find to my inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, pur&s;ued &s;he, that this mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, and vir|tuous young creature, as I once believed her, is in reality an artful hypocrite, who&s;e only aim is to make her fortune, by en&s;naring &s;ome unex|perienced youth into a marriage. Let us join our endeavours then, my dear Mrs. Barton, to pre&s;erve our &s;ons from this danger: this is a
<PB N="658" REF="264">
common cau&s;e, all mothers are concerned in it; we will &s;hew the young di&s;&s;embler in her true colours, and prevent her impo&s;ing upon others as &s;he has done on us.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Barton, who never carried her reflections very far, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with Mrs. Howard's pre&s;ent behaviour, that &s;he forgot all the pa&s;t: the&s;e two ladies became on a &s;udden the be&s;t friends in the world, and this union was to be ce|mented with the ruin of Sophia's fame; &s;uch be|ginnings have certain female friend&s;hips, and &s;uch are the leagues in which the wicked join.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barton propo&s;ed to have her &s;ent for into their pre&s;ence, and after reproaching her &s;everely, di&s;mi&s;s her with contempt; but the more politic Mrs. Howard, who&s;e views were at once to de&s;troy Sophia's reputation, and to &s;ecure her own, di&s;ap|proved of this har&s;h treatment, as &s;he called it, and charitably re&s;olved to ruin her with all po&s;&s;ible gen|tlene&s;s.</P>
<P>She wrote to Mrs. Gibbons, and acquainted her, that having di&s;covered an intrigue carrying on be|tween Sophia and her &s;on, &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s her immediately out of her family; but that the poor young creature might be expo&s;ed as little as po&s;&s;ible to cen&s;ure, &s;he begged &s;he would come her&s;elf to fetch her away, and deliver her to her friends, with a caution to watch her conduct carefully.</P>
<P>She recommended &s;ecrecy to her for Sophia's &s;ake; and a&s;&s;ured her that if it had not been for this di&s;covery of her bad conduct, &s;he had re&s;olved to have provided for her hand&s;omely.</P>
<P><PB N="659" REF="265">Mrs. Gibbons, whom this letter threw into the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, immediately communicated the contents of it to Dolly and William, with whom &s;he now lived.</P>
<P>Dolly bur&s;t into tears of grief and indignation, and earne&s;tly intreated her to go immediately and take Mi&s;s Sophia out of a hou&s;e where her merit was &s;o little under&s;tood; but William, who looked farther into the con&s;equences of this affair than either his wife or his aunt, believed it nece&s;&s;ary for the ju&s;tification of Sophia's honour, that Mr. Law|&s;on &s;hould wait upon Mrs. Howard, and demand an explanation of tho&s;e cen&s;ures which &s;he had ca&s;t upon a young lady confided to his care; rightly judging, that if malice was the &s;ource of her accu|&s;ation, &s;he would not dare to pur&s;ue it with a man of his character; and if it aro&s;e from the infor|mation of others, he would be able to detect the fal&s;hood of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed with Mrs. Gibbons, who had been very de&s;irous to &s;hew her eloquence upon this occa&s;ion, and was re&s;olved, &s;he &s;aid, not to have &s;pared Mrs. Howard for her <HI>immature</HI> con|clusions.</P>
<P>William went immediately to his father-in-law, and acquainted him with what had happened. Mr. Law&s;on was grieved from the con&s;ideration of what Sophia's delicate &s;en&s;ibility would feel from &s;uch an attack upon her reputation; and this was the wor&s;t that he apprehended could happen from ca|lumnies which the purity of her manners and the innocency of her life would be always a &s;ufficient refutation of. A wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;on, he
<PB N="660" REF="266">
knew, was out of the reach of fortune, though not free from the malice of it. All attempts again&s;t &s;uch a one are, as the poet &s;ays, like the arrows of Xerxes; they may darken the day, but cannot &s;tifle the &s;un.</P>
<P>His impatience to take Sophia out of the hands of a woman whom he conceived to be either very malicious, or very imprudent, made him defer his vi&s;it no longer than till the afternoon.</P>
<P>When he &s;ent in his name, Mrs. Howard, who had no &s;u&s;picion of the occa&s;ion of his coming, ordered him to be &s;hewn into a parlour, where &s;he &s;uffered him to wait near an hour before &s;he ad|mitted him to her pre&s;ence; a country curate be|ing in her opinion a per&s;on too in&s;ignificant to lay claim to any degree of con&s;ideration, and be&s;ides, this &s;ort of neglect being affected by many per&s;ons of quality, to whom it certainly gives great im|portance and dignity, their imitators never lo&s;e any opportunity of exerci&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on was at la&s;t &s;ummoned to the lady's dre&s;&s;ing-room, where he expected to have found Sophia, but was glad to &s;ee Mrs. Howard alone. She a&s;ked him with a little &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, if he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with her; to which he replied, with a &s;olemnity in his look and accent that &s;ur|pri&s;ed her,
<Q>That being a friend to mi&s;s Sophia Darnley, and the per&s;on to who&s;e care &s;he was confided by her relations, he thought it his duty to enquire what part of her conduct had given occa&s;ion for tho&s;e unfavourable &s;u&s;picions which were entertained of her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="661" REF="267">
<Q>Mrs. Gibbons, madam, pur&s;ued he, has com|municated to me a letter which &s;he has received from you, wherein there is a heavy charge again&s;t mi&s;s Sophia; a charge which none who know her can think it po&s;&s;ible for her to de&s;erve. There mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome mi&s;take here, madam; you have been mi&s;informed, or appearances have de|ceived you, and in ju&s;tice to you, as well as to one of the mo&s;t virtuous and amiable young wo|men in the world, I am re&s;olved to trace the &s;ource of the&s;e calumnies, that her innocence may be fully cleared. I beg of you then, madam, let me know what foundation you have for be|lieving that Mi&s;s Sophia&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard, whom this &s;peech had thrown into great confu&s;ion, interrupted him here, to pre|vent his repeating tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in her letter, the meaning of which, though obvious, &s;he dur&s;t not avow.</P>
<P><Q>I find, &s;aid &s;he, that you and Mrs. Gibbons have &s;een this affair in a wor&s;e light than I intend|ed you &s;hould; my &s;on has been fooli&s;h enough to entertain a liking for this girl, whom I took under my protection, with a view to provide for her hand&s;omely, and &s;he has been wi&s;e enough pur&s;ued &s;he, with an ironical &s;mile, to give him encouragement, I &s;uppo&s;e; but with all her ex|cellencies, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to make her my daughter-in-law.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard threw in this la&s;t &s;oftening expre&s;|&s;ion, in hopes it would &s;atisfy Mr. Law&s;on, and added, that to prevent any thing happening, which might
<PB N="662" REF="268">
be di&s;agreeable to her, &s;he begged he would take Sophia home with him.</P>
<P><Q>Mo&s;t willingly, madam, &s;aid he; but &s;ince it &s;eems to be your opinion, that this young gen|tlewoman has encouraged the clande&s;tine ad|dre&s;&s;es of your &s;on, I think it will be proper to examine fir&s;t into the truth of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, that you may not part with wor&s;e thoughts of her than &s;he de&s;erves.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Howard being thus pre&s;t, and unwilling to enter into an explanation that would expo&s;e all her artifices, was forced to acknowledge that &s;he had no other foundation for her fears than the pa&s;|&s;ion her &s;on had owned for her; and having made this unwilling conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he left him with a coun|tenance inflamed with &s;tifled rage, &s;aying &s;he would &s;end Sophia to him.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he went into the room where &s;he was at work, and told her, her friend the curate was waiting to carry her home. Ob&s;erving her to look extremely &s;urpri&s;ed,
<Q>If you con&s;ider, &s;aid &s;he, what returns you have made me for the be|nefits I have conferred upon you, you will not think it &s;trange that we &s;hould part in this manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;s me, cried Sophia, what have I done to de&s;erve &s;uch reproaches?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot &s;tay to talk to you now, &s;aid Mrs. Howard; I have explained my&s;elf to Mr. Law&s;on, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I now can only wi&s;h you well.</Q></P>
<P>She hurried out of the room when &s;he had &s;aid this; and Sophia, in the utmo&s;t perplexity and con|cern,
<PB N="663" REF="269">
flew down &s;tairs to Mr. Law&s;on, who was already at the gate waiting to help her into the chai&s;e: &s;he gave him her hand, a&s;king him at the &s;ame time, with great emotion,
<Q>What Mrs. Howard accu&s;ed her of?</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as they drove away, Mr. Law&s;on re|lated all that had pa&s;t between that lady and him, which filled Sophia with new a&s;toni&s;hment: &s;he could not comprehend Mrs. Howard's motives for acting in the manner &s;he had done with regard to her; all her conduct appeared to her highly extra|vagant and incon&s;i&s;tent; &s;he a&s;ked Mr. Law&s;on a thou&s;and que&s;tions, full of that &s;implicity which ever accompanies real goodne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>He gave her &s;ome notion of the dangerous cha|racter of Mrs Howard, and greatly blamed her for having &s;o &s;uddenly accepted her invitation, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting Mr. Herbert.
<Q>It is a maxim, pur&s;ued he, of one of the wi&s;e&s;t of the antients, that in forming new connections of every &s;ort, it is of great importance in what manner the fir&s;t approaches are made, and by who&s;e hands the avenues of friend&s;hip are laid open.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on, by this hint, gave Sophia to under|&s;tand, that he did not think Mrs. Gibbons, a pro|per per&s;on to introduce her into the world. She was now &s;en&s;ible that &s;he had been too precipitate; but her motives were &s;o generous, that Mr. Her|bert, whom in a letter &s;he acquainted with the whole affair, ea&s;ily ju&s;tified her in his own opinion, though he earne&s;tly, recommended it to her not to let her apprehen&s;ions of being burthen&s;ome to him draw her into new inconveniencies.</P>
<P><PB N="664" REF="270">Mr. Law&s;on having, as he imagined, prevented Mrs. Howard from making any future attack upon Sophia's reputation, by obliging her to acknow|ledge her innocence, was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear where|ever he went, of the calumnies &s;he invented again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than for per&s;ons to hate with extreme inveteracy tho&s;e whom they have injured; and although Mrs. Howard was con|vinced, that Sophia would not admit a vi&s;it from her &s;on, (who now openly avowed his pa&s;&s;ion for her;) that &s;he refu&s;ed to receive his letters, and &s;hunned every place where &s;he thought it po&s;&s;ible to meet him; yet pretending to be apprehen&s;ive that the youth would be drawn into a clande&s;tine marriage, &s;he &s;ent him away precipitately upon his travels, and this gave a colour to new invectives again&s;t Sophia, who tru&s;ting only to her innocence for her ju&s;tification, had the &s;atisfaction to find that innocence fully acknowledged in the e&s;teem and re&s;pect with which &s;he was treated by all the per|&s;ons of fa&s;hion in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who in every new trial to which &s;he was expo&s;ed, found greater cau&s;e for admi|ration of her character, prai&s;ed the gentlene&s;s and forgiving &s;pirit which &s;he di&s;covered upon this oc|ca&s;ion; but Mrs. Gibbons was not wholly &s;atisfied with her conduct,
<Q>You ought to <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> upon Mrs. Howard, &s;aid &s;he, and tell the world how de&s;irous &s;he was to have you married to her friend's &s;on, though &s;he makes &s;uch a clutter about her own: indeed you want &s;pirit, mi&s;s
<PB N="665" REF="271">
Sophia,</Q>
added the old lady, with a little con|tempt.</P>
<P><Q>I am not of your opinion, madam, replied So|phia; for in taking revenge upon our enemies, we are only even with them; in pa&s;&s;ing over their malice we are &s;uperior.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, well, interrupted Mrs. Gibbons, I have no notion of &s;uch <HI>&s;uperiou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> I always re&s;ent injuries, and Mrs. Howard &s;hall feel my re&s;ent|ment for her malice to you. I have not returned her la&s;t vi&s;it yet, and perhaps I may not this month; this is pretty &s;evere I think.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, compo&s;ing her countenance as well as &s;he could, thanked Mrs. Gibbons for this in&s;tance of her friend&s;hip to her; but &s;he had no opportunity to ob&s;erve whether &s;he kept her word, for &s;he was &s;ummoned to town by a letter from her mother, which gave her a melancholy account of her affairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley acquainted her that the gentle|man was dead who paid her the annuity which Sir Charles had &s;tipulated for her when he procured him her late hu&s;band's place. She de&s;ired her to come immediately to town to a&s;&s;i&s;t her under her misfortunes; and added in a po&s;t&s;cript, as if reluc|tantly, that Harriot had left her, and was not &s;o du|tiful as &s;he could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Sophia read this letter with tears; and, impatient to comfort her afflicted mother, &s;he in&s;tantly pre|pared for her little journey.</P>
<P>All Mr. Law&s;on's family parted from her with great regret; but Dolly's affliction was extreme, and Sophia amid&s;t &s;o many greater cau&s;es of &s;orrow,
<PB N="666" REF="272">
felt a new pang when &s;he took leave of her tender and innocent friend.</P>
<P>To &s;pare Mr. Law&s;on the trouble of conducting her to town, &s;he accepted a place in the coach of a lady with whom &s;he had lately become acquaint|ed, and who profe&s;&s;ed a particular e&s;teem for her.</P>
<P>On her arrival at her mother's hou&s;e, &s;he found only a &s;ervant there, who informed her that her mi&s;tre&s;s had taken lodgings at Ken&s;ington for the air, having been indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sophia ordered her to get a hackney coach to the door, and was hurrying away without daring to enquire for her &s;i&s;ter, when the maid told her Mi&s;s Darnley de&s;ired to &s;ee her before &s;he went to Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P>"Where is my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Sophia, with a faul|tering accent.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer &s;he received was a &s;troke of fortune more cruel than any &s;he had yet experienced: her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he found, lived in the hou&s;e which Sir Charles had once offered to her.</P>
<P>Trembling and pale &s;he ordered the coachman to drive thither, and drawing up the windows, re|lieved her labouring heart with a &s;hower of tears.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P><Q>I HAVE &s;ome important bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid he, which demands my pre&s;ence in Sarago&s;&s;a; my health will not permit me to take this journey, I mu&s;t intreat you therefore to go in my &s;tead; I have ordered my equipage to be got ready, and you will oblige me by &s;etting out immediately.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Marquis de Benavides is older than me by a great number of years; I have always had the &s;ame re&s;pect for him as for a father, and he has held the place of one to me. Be&s;ides, I had no rea&s;on to urge which could di&s;pen&s;e with my doing as he de&s;ired. I was obliged therefore to re&s;olve to go; but I thought this ready compliance gave me a right to &s;peak to him in favour of Madame de Benavides. What did I not &s;ay to &s;often him! he appeared to me to be &s;haken; I even fancied I &s;aw tears in his eyes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have loved Madame de Benavides, &s;aid he to me, with the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion, it is not yet extingui&s;hed in my heart; but time and her fu|ture
<PB N="674" REF="280">
conduct can only efface the remembrance of what I have &s;een.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I dur&s;t not enter into any di&s;cour&s;e with him concerning the cau&s;e of his complaints; that would have again recalled his former rage; I on|ly de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to acquaint my &s;i&s;ter-in-law with the hopes he had given me. He granted my reque&s;t. This poor lady received the news I brought her with a kind of joy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know, &s;aid &s;he, that I can never be happy with Mon&s;ieur de Benavides; but I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the con&s;olation of being where my duty calls me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After having again a&s;&s;ured her of my brother's good di&s;po&s;ition to her, I took my leave of her. One of the chief dome&s;tics of the hou&s;e, in whom I confided, had promi&s;ed to be &s;trictly attentive to every thing that regarded her, and to give me information.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the&s;e precautions, which I thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I &s;et out for Sarago&s;&s;a. I had been there fifteen days without having any news from the ca&s;tle, and was beginning to be very unea&s;y at this long &s;ilence, when I received a letter from the faithful dome&s;tic I mentioned. He informed me that three days after my departure, Mon&s;ieur de Benavides had di&s;charged him and all the re&s;t of his &s;ervants, except one man whom he named to me, and the wife of that man. I trembled as I read this letter, and without troubling my&s;elf any further about the bu&s;ine&s;s with which I was charged, I hired po&s;t-hor&s;es to return to the ca&s;tle. When I was within a day's journey of this place,
<PB N="675" REF="281">
received the fatal news of the death of Madame de Benavides. My brother, who wrote to me him&s;elf, appeared &s;o greatly affected, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e he had been acce&s;&s;ary to it. He told me, the great love he had for his wife had &s;ubdued his re&s;entment, and that he was ready to pardon her when death matched her from him: that &s;he had relap&s;ed a &s;hort time after my de|parture, and her fever encrea&s;ing, &s;he died upon the fifteenth day of her illne&s;s. Since I came hither to &s;eek &s;ome con&s;olation in the company of Don Jerome, I have been informed my bro|ther is plunged in the deepe&s;t &s;adne&s;s; that he &s;ees no one, and he has even entreated me to defer &s;eeing him for &s;ome time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I find no difficulty in complying with his re|que&s;t, continued Don Gabriel; tho&s;e places in which I have &s;een the unfortunate Madame de Benavides, and where I &s;hall no more &s;ee her, would increa&s;e my grief. Her death &s;eems to have awakened all my former &s;entiments, and I know not whether the tears I &s;hed do not more proceed from love than friend&s;hip: I have de|termined to go into Hungary, where I hope either to find death in the war, or to recover the peace I have lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Here Don Gabriel cea&s;ed to &s;peak. I was not able to an&s;wer him, but with tears; my voice was lo&s;t in &s;ighs, Don Gabriel al&s;o wept bitterly: at length he left me without my being able to utter a &s;ingle word. Don Jerome attended him out, and I was left alone. The melancholy relation I had ju&s;t heard increa&s;ed my impatience to &s;ee my&s;elf
<PB N="676" REF="282">
in a place where I might abandon my&s;elf, without interruption, to the exce&s;s of my grief.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of executing this &s;cheme ha&s;tened my cure: after having been long in a langui&s;hing con|dition, my wound was healed, my &s;trength re|turned, and I found my&s;elf able in a little time to leave the convent.</P>
<P>The parting between Don Jerome and me was on his &s;ide full of tenderne&s;s and friendly concern; but the lo&s;s of Adelaida had left me in&s;en&s;ible to all other impre&s;&s;ions. I would not acquaint him with my de&s;ign, le&s;t he &s;hould endeavour to oppo&s;e it: I wrote to my mother, and &s;ent my letter by Saint Laurent, making him believe that I would wait for an an&s;wer, in the place I then was.</P>
<P>This letter contained an account of all that had happened to me &s;ince I &s;aw her la&s;t: I earne&s;tly a&s;ked her pardon for leaving her, as I re&s;olved to do, for ever. I added, that in tenderne&s;s to her maternal affection, I cho&s;e to &s;pare her the &s;ight of a mi&s;erable wretch, who had now nothing left to wi&s;h for but death; and la&s;tly, I conjured her not to make any attempts to di&s;cover the place of my retreat, and recommended the faithful Saint Lau|rent to her protection.</P>
<P>When I parted with him, I gave him all the money I had about me, re&s;erving only what was &s;ufficient to defray my expences during my journey. The letter I had received from Madame de Bena|vides, and her picture, which I wore next my heart, was all the wealth I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. I travelled with an impatience which hardly allowed me to &s;top a moment, to the abbey de la F&mdash;
<PB N="677" REF="283">
Upon my arrival I demanded the habit of the order. The father abbot obliged me to undergo the probationary forms; and when they were fini&s;h|ed, a&s;ked me whether the wretched diet, and other au&s;terities did not appear more than equal to my &s;trength. Ab&s;orbed in grief, I had not even per|ceived the difference of my diet, and the au&s;terities he mentioned: my in&s;en&s;ibility was taken for a mark of zeal, and I was received.</P>
<P>The certainty I now had that my tears might flow uninterrupted, and that I might pa&s;s my whole life in this &s;ad employment, gave me &s;ome con&s;o|lation; the horrid &s;olitude, the melancholy &s;ilence that reigned in this cloi&s;ter, the mortified counte|nances of all about me, left me wholly devoted to that grief which was become &s;o precious to me, that it &s;upplied the place of all I had lo&s;t. I per|formed, all the exerci&s;es of the cloi&s;ter without thinking of their &s;everity, for every thing was alike indifferent to me. I went every day into the thicke&s;t part of the wood; there would I read over the letter, and gaze on the picture of my Adelaida, bathe them both with my tears, and replacing them upon my heart, return with greater weight of grief.</P>
<P>Three years I led this melancholy life, while time neither alleviated my &s;orrow, nor brought the period to it which I &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, when one morning I was &s;ummoned by the tolling of the bell to be pre&s;ent at the death of one of the reli|gious. He was already laid upon the a&s;hes, the la&s;t &s;acrament was going to be admini&s;tred to him, when he de&s;ired to &s;peak to the father abbot.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="284">
<Q>What I am going to &s;ay father, &s;aid the dying penitent, will animate with new fervour all who &s;hall hear me, &s;ince by methods &s;o extraordinary, I have been drawn out of the aby&s;s of &s;in and mi&s;ery into which I was plunged, and conducted into the port of &s;alvation; I am unworthy of the name of brother, with which the&s;e holy religious have honoured me: in me you behold an un|happy woman, whom a profane pa&s;&s;ion has led to this &s;anctified place. I loved and was beloved by a young man of a rank equal to my own; the mutual hatred of our fathers was an in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacle to our marriage: I was even obliged for the &s;afety of my lover, to give my hand to another per&s;on, and in the choice of my hu&s;band, I endeavoured &s;till to give him proofs of the conti|nuance of my pa&s;&s;ion. The man who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to in&s;pire me with any &s;entiments but tho&s;e of hatred or contempt, was preferred to every other who addre&s;&s;ed me, becau&s;e the &s;acrifice I made him &s;hould be compleat, and that he might have no cau&s;e for jealou&s;y. The Almighty decreed that a marriage contracted with &s;uch criminal views &s;hould prove a &s;ource of mi&s;ery to me. Although I would never after con&s;ent to &s;ee my lover, yet my hu&s;band and he met and wounded each other before my eyes. Terror and grief threw me into a violent illne&s;s; I was &s;carcely re|covered when my hu&s;band &s;hut me up in a pri|vate apartment of his ca&s;tle, and cau&s;ed it to be reported that I was dead.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I continued two years in that melancholy confinement, with no other con&s;olation, than
<PB N="679" REF="285">
what the compa&s;&s;ion of her who daily brought me my food afforded me. My hu&s;band, not &s;atisfied with the mi&s;eries he inflicted on me, had the cruelty to in&s;ult me under them. Oh my God, what do I &s;ay! dare I accu&s;e of cruelty the in&s;trument thou wa&s;t plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of for my puni&s;hment? the&s;e afflictions did not bring me to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the extravagances of my conduct: in&s;tead of weeping for my faults, I wept only for my lover.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The death of my hu&s;band &s;et me at liberty. The woman who &s;erved me, being the only per|&s;on who knew the truth of my condition, came to open the doors of my pri&s;on, and informed me that I had pa&s;&s;ed for dead from the moment I entered it. Not doubting but the treatment I had met with from my hu&s;band had given ri&s;e to very unfavourable &s;u&s;picions of my virtue, I deliberated whether it was not nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould pa&s;s the re&s;t of my days in a convent; and I was confirmed in this de&s;ign when I learned that the only per&s;on who could retain me in the world had not been heard of for a long time. I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in the habit of a man, that I might leave the ca&s;tle without being known.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The convent to which I re&s;olved to retire was that in which I was educated, and is but a few leagues di&s;tant from hence. I was travelling to it when the &s;olitarine&s;s of this place &s;triking my imagination as I pa&s;&s;ed by, I alighted from my chai&s;e, in order to indulge my &s;ad reflections a few moments: a &s;ecret impul&s;e which I could not re&s;i&s;t led me into your chapel. Scarce had I en|tered
<PB N="680" REF="286">
when among the voices that &s;ung the prai&s;es of our Lord, I di&s;tingui&s;hed one too well ac|cu&s;tomed to reach my heart. I thought at fir&s;t that my di&s;ordered imagination had deceived me by a fancied re&s;emblance; but when I approached, notwith&s;tanding the alteration which time, grief, and the au&s;terities of a cloi&s;ter had made in his countenance, I immediately knew that lover &s;o dear to my remembrance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Great God! what became of me at this &s;ight! what were the cruel agitations of my mind! far from prai&s;ing the Almighty for calling him to &s;o holy a profe&s;&s;ion, I bla&s;phemed again&s;t him for having deprived me of him: you puni&s;hed not my impious murmurs, oh my God! and you made u&s;e of my own folly and mi&s;ery to draw me to your &s;elf!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was not able to leave a place which inclo&s;ed what I loved; and that we might no more be &s;eparated, I di&s;charged my guide, and pre&s;ented my&s;elf, father, to you. Deceived by the eager|ne&s;s I di&s;covered to be admitted into your cloi&s;ter, you received me willingly. Alas! what were the di&s;po&s;itions I brought to your holy exerci&s;es? a heart filled with a profane pa&s;&s;ion, and every thought employed on the dear object of its ten|derne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Almighty, who by abandoning me to my wild affections, would give me greater cau&s;e for humbling my&s;elf one day before him, doubtle&s;s permitted tho&s;e impoi&s;oned delights which I ta&s;ted in breathing the &s;ame air, and living in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him I loved. I followed
<PB N="681" REF="287">
him every where: I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his labours as much as my &s;trength would allow, and in tho&s;e moments I thought my&s;elf over-paid for all that I had &s;uffered; but yet my imprudent tender|ne&s;s did not carry me &s;o far as to make my&s;elf known to him. But what was the motive that hindered me? the fear of di&s;turbing the quiet of him for whom I had lo&s;t my own: but for this fear I &s;hould perhaps have attempted to &s;natch from God a &s;oul which I believed wholly devoted to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Two months are now elap&s;ed, &s;ince in obe|dience to a regulation of our holy founder, who was de&s;irous by a continual idea of death, to &s;anctify the lives of his religious, we have been obliged each to dig his own grave. I followed as u&s;ual him to whom I was attached by ties &s;o &s;hameful. The &s;ight of his grave, the ardour with which he dug it, pierced my heart with &s;uch an exce&s;s of &s;orrow, that I was obliged to leave him, and retire to the mo&s;t unfrequented part of the wood, to give free cour&s;e to my tears. From that moment I was in continual apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing him; the idea of his death was ever pre&s;ent to my mind; my tender|ne&s;s increa&s;ed, I followed him every where; and if I was &s;ome hours of the day without &s;eeing him, I feared I &s;hould never &s;ee him more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But now the happy moment arrived when God was plea&s;ed to draw me to him&s;elf. I went with the man my &s;oul &s;o fondly loved, into the fore&s;t to get wood for the u&s;e of the hou&s;e; after &s;ome time &s;pent in this employment, I perceived that
<PB N="682" REF="288">
my companion had left me: anxious and unea&s;y at his ab&s;ence, I could not help going to &s;eek for him. After having wandered through great part of the fore&s;t, I &s;aw him at length in one of the mo&s;t retired parts of it, employed in gazing earne&s;tly upon &s;omething he had taken from his bo&s;om: he was in &s;o profound a revery, that I came up clo&s;e to him, and had lei&s;ure to look upon what he held in his hand, without his per|ceiving me. How great was my a&s;toni&s;hment when I &s;aw it was my own picture!</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was now &s;en&s;ible, that far from enjoying that quiet I had been &s;o unwilling to interrupt, he was like me, the mi&s;erable victim of a criminal pa&s;&s;ion. I &s;aw the powerful hand of God ready to fall upon him; that fatal pa&s;&s;ion which I had carried with me even to the foot of his altar, &s;eemed to have drawn the vengeance of heaven upon him who was the object of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Full of this terrifying idea I came to pro&s;trate my&s;elf before tho&s;e altars; I implored of God my own conver&s;ion, in order to obtain that of my lover. Yes, oh my God, it was for him that I offered up my &s;upplications to thee! for him I &s;hed tears of remor&s;e and grief; it was the de|&s;ire of his &s;alvation that brought me to thee. Thou had&s;t compa&s;&s;ion upon my weakne&s;s; my prayer, profane as it was, thou did&s;t not reject: my heart became &s;en&s;ible of the healing power of thy grace: from that bli&s;sful moment I ex|perienced the peace of a &s;oul which is with thee, and de&s;ires only thee; thou wa&s;t plea&s;ed to purify me by &s;ufferings; I was &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="683" REF="289">
&s;oon after. If the partner of my wild affections &s;till groans under the weight of his profane pa&s;&s;ion, let him ca&s;t his eyes upon me: let him view the wretch whom he has &s;o madly loved: let him reflect upon that tremendous moment to which I am now arrived, and to which he &s;hall &s;hortly arrive. Oh, let him &s;eek God ere he has &s;ilenced his mercy to li&s;ten only to his ju&s;tice. But I feel the time of my la&s;t &s;acrifice approach|ing. I be&s;eech the&s;e holy religious to offer up their prayers for my departing &s;oul. I humbly intreat their pardon for the offence I have given them, and I acknowledge my&s;elf unworthy to partake of their &s;epulchre.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ound of that adored voice, now undi&s;|gui&s;ed, and always pre&s;ent to my remembrance, made me know Adelaida at the fir&s;t words &s;he pro|nounced. What language can convey an idea of what I then felt! all that the mo&s;t ardent love, all that the tendere&s;t companion, all that the mo&s;t po|ignant grief, and wilde&s;t de&s;pair could in&s;pire, tore my di&s;tracted &s;oul that moment. I was pro&s;trate on the ground, like the other religious, while &s;he was &s;peaking: the fear of lo&s;ing any one of her words re&s;trained my cries; but when I found, that in uttering the la&s;t &s;he had expired, the hou&s;e ecchoed with my agonizing &s;hrieks.</P>
<P>The religious running to me rai&s;ed me from the ground; I tore my&s;elf put of their arms, flew to the corps of Adelaida, and kneeling down be|&s;ide it, I bathed one of her lifele&s;s hands with my tears.
<Q>I have lo&s;t you then a &s;econd time, my dear Adelaida, cried I, and I have lo&s;t you for
<PB N="684" REF="290">
ever. What! have you been &s;o long with me, and did not my ungrateful heart acknowledge you? but we will never more be &s;eparated: death, added I, folding her in my arms, death, le&s;s cruel than my inexorable father, &s;hall now, in &s;pite of him, unite us for ever.</Q></P>
<P>True piety is never &s;evere. The father abbot, moved at this light, endeavoured by the tendere&s;t condolences, and the mo&s;t holy exhortations to &s;often my grief, and prevail upon me to abandon the corps of Adelaida, which I held fa&s;t locked in my arms: finding me deaf to all he could urge, he was obliged to u&s;e force; they dragged me from the lovely body into my own cell, whither the father-abbot followed me: he &s;taid with me the whole night, vainly attempting to calm my mind, my de&s;pair was increa&s;ed by the con&s;olations he offered me.</P>
<P><Q>Give me Adelaida, &s;aid I, why have you &s;e|parated us? oh, why did not my &s;oul take its flight with hers? Alas! I can live no longer in a place where I have lo&s;t her, and where &s;he &s;uffered &s;o many mi&s;eries. Permit me, added I, throw|ing my&s;elf at his feet, permit me to leave this cloi&s;ter; what will you do with a mi&s;erable wretch who&s;e de&s;pair will trouble your repo&s;e? &s;uffer me to retire to &s;ome other &s;olitude, there to wait for a final end to all my &s;orrows. My dear Adelaida will obtain of God that my peni|tence and prayers may be affectual for my &s;al|vation: and oh, father, do not refu&s;e my la&s;t reque&s;t, promi&s;e me that the &s;ame tomb &s;hall unite our a&s;hes, and I in return engage not to
<PB N="685" REF="291">
ha&s;ten that moment which my &s;oul &s;o ardently pants after.</Q></P>
<P>The father-abbot moved with compa&s;&s;ion for my misfortunes, and perhaps de&s;irous of removing from the eyes of his religious, an object which gave &s;o much &s;candal to their piety, granted my reque&s;t, and promi&s;ed to do what I de&s;ired. I left the con|vent that moment, and came to this &s;olitary wild, where I have lived &s;everal years, having no other con&s;olation than that of weeping for what I have lo&s;t.</P>

<P>THE &s;imple plea&s;ures are le&s;s poignant, le&s;s affecting it is true, the others tran&s;port the &s;oul, as they &s;tir the &s;prings of the pa&s;&s;ions; but the fir&s;t are mo&s;t eligible, &s;eeing they afford an equal and durable &s;atisfaction without any evil con&s;equences.

<P>All that we can do for children entru&s;ted to our care, is to u&s;e them to a plain way of life, to for|tify the habit of it in them for as long as we can; to give them timely apprehen&s;ions of the inconve|niences con&s;equent to other &s;orts of plea&s;ure, and never to leave them to their own conduct, as is generally done, ju&s;t at the time when the pa&s;&s;ions begin to make them&s;elves be felt, and when, of
<PB N="687" REF="293">
con&s;equence, there is the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for re|&s;traint.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that of all the pains of educating none is comparable to that of bringing up a child who is deficient in &s;en&s;ibility: lively and &s;en&s;ible tempers are &s;ubject to terrible deviations; pa&s;&s;ion and pre&s;umption hurry them away, never|thele&s;s have they great re&s;ources, and frequently are &s;een to come back, after having ran great lengths. In&s;truction is in them a concealed bud that &s;hoots out and &s;ome times bears fruit, when experience brings its a&s;&s;i&s;tance to rea&s;on, and the pa&s;&s;ions are grown cool; at lea&s;t one finds &s;omething in them, by which to make them attentive and awaken their curio&s;ity; &s;omething whereby to intere&s;t them in what we would teach, and to affect their &s;en&s;e of honour; whereas we have no hold upon indolent tempers, their thoughts are but the wandering of the mind, they are never where they ought to be; there is no touching them to the quick, even by correction; they hear all, they feel nothing. This indolence make the child negligent, and di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing he does; here it is that the be&s;t &s;cheme of education runs the ri&s;k of failing, in ca&s;e great diligence is not u&s;ed to obviate the evil from their earlie&s;t infancy.</P>
<P>Many people that do not fathom deep enough, conclude from this ill &s;ucce&s;s, that it is nature which performs all in making men of merit, education nothing; whereas, the true conclu&s;ion &s;hould be, that &s;ome tempers ate like &s;ome ungrateful &s;oils, upon which cultivation has but &s;mall effect; and the matter is made wor&s;e when the&s;e edecations &s;o dif|ficult
<PB N="688" REF="294">
to accompli&s;h are ob&s;tructed, or neglected, or badly regulated in the fir&s;t out&s;et.</P>
<P>Further than this we ought to ob&s;erve that there are &s;ome &s;orts of tempers which we are apt greatly to mi&s;take; they appear at fir&s;t pretty and promi|&s;ing, becau&s;e the early graces of infancy throw a lu&s;tre over all: there is an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;omething of the tender and amiable, that keeps us off from a clo&s;e examination of the compo&s;ition of features; every in&s;tance of wit in them &s;urpri&s;es, becau&s;e not expected at that age; all the faultine&s;s of judg|ment is excu&s;ed, and carries the grace of ingenu|ou&s;ne&s;s; we mi&s;take a certain corporeal vivacity, which never fails to appear in children for mental. Hence it is that infancy &s;eems to promi&s;e &s;o much and yields &s;o little. One has been remarkable for his wit at five years old, and in proportion as he grew up, fallen into ob&s;curity or contempt.</P>
<P>Of all the qualities of children, there is but one to be depended on, that is, a good rea&s;oning fa|culty; this grows up with them, provided it be cultivated; the graces of infancy will fade, the vi|vacity decay, nay the tenderne&s;s of heart often be lo&s;t, fora&s;much as the pa&s;&s;ions and conver&s;e with a de&s;igning world, in&s;en&s;ibly harden young people, as they come forward on the &s;tage of life.</P>
<P>Try then to di&s;cover, beyond the&s;e graces of infan|cy, whether the di&s;po&s;ition which you have to direct, be void of curio&s;ity, or too little &s;en&s;ible to generous emulation. Should this be the ca&s;e, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible but that every per&s;on engaged in his edu|cation, will quickly be di&s;couraged at &s;o fruitle&s;s &s;o knotty a ta&s;k; wherefore we &s;hould endeavour
<PB N="689" REF="295">
immediately to put in motion every &s;pring of the &s;oul of that child, in order to rouze him from his lethargy. Whenever you perceive this difficulty, do not attempt a &s;eries of in&s;truction; take great care not to load his memory, this is what would amaze and oppre&s;s the brain; fatigue him not with rules and re&s;trictions; &s;pirit him up, far he is fallen into the contrary extreme to pre&s;umption; fear not to demon&s;trate to him, with di&s;cretion, what he is capable of doing; be plea&s;ed with a little; make him ob&s;erve even his &s;malle&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; re|pre&s;ent to him how needle&s;ly he was afraid of mi&s;|carrying in things that he performs well; &s;et emu|lation to work; jealou&s;y is more prevalent in chil|dren than one would imagine, one may &s;ee &s;ome of them growing lean and pining with a &s;ecret angui&s;h, becau&s;e others are more loved or more care&s;&s;ed than them&s;elves.

Shew the child other children that hardly do better than he; for examples di&s;pro|portioned to his weakne&s;s would di&s;courage him utterly: from time to time give him little victories over his rivals; bring him, if po&s;&s;ible, to laugh freely with you at his own timidity; point out &s;ome as fearful as him&s;elf that have got the better of their di&s;po&s;ition; inform him, but indirectly, as it were &s;peaking of others, that want of courage, and idlene&s;s, &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le the &s;oul; that the li&s;tle&s;s, and the inattentive, whatever genius they may have, de|&s;troy their own faculties and degrade them&s;elves.</P>

<P>There is another &s;ort of &s;en&s;ibility, which to ex|cite is &s;till more difficult, and more important, and that is friend&s;hip; the moment a child is capable, no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in turning his affections to|wards their proper objects, per&s;ons who will be of &s;ervice to him.</P>
<P><PB N="691" REF="297">By friend&s;hip he will be led to every thing that can be de&s;ired of him: it is a &s;ure attachment to draw him to his good, provided we know how to make u&s;e of it: all that is to be feared is either too exce&s;&s;ive, or ill-placed affections.</P>
<P>But there are other children that are born politic, clo&s;e, unconcerned, but drawing every thing &s;ecretly to their own ends: they deceive their parents, who&s;e tenderne&s;s makes them credulous; they pre|tend to love them; they &s;tudy their inclinations, in order to conform to them; they &s;eem more do|cile than other children of their age, who act with|out di&s;gui&s;e, as it were upon honour; their &s;upple|ne&s;s, while it conceals a &s;tubborn &s;elf-will, has the appearance of true and innate gentlene&s;s; and their real temper, long di&s;&s;embled, does not entirely di&s;|play it&s;elf till the opportunity of reforming it is pa&s;t and gone.</P>
<P>If there is a temper upon which education can have no effect, we may &s;ay this is it; and at the &s;ame time mu&s;t own, that the number of &s;uch is greater than will be ea&s;ily imagined. Parents can|not quickly come into the belief that their child has a bad heart; and what they will not &s;ee them|&s;elves, no others will have the courage to try to convince them of, and thus the evil augments continually; the principal remedy would be, to give them entire liberty from their earlie&s;t in|fancy of &s;hewing their di&s;po&s;ition: before we cor|rect we mu&s;t know them thoroughly. Naturally, they are plain and open; but, con&s;train them never &s;o little, give them but an example of di&s;gui&s;e, they never come back to the original &s;implicity. True
<PB N="692" REF="298">
it is, that God alone be&s;toweth a tender and good heart: we can but incite, by examples of genero|&s;ity, by maxims of hone&s;ty and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, by manife&s;ting contempt for per&s;ons guilty of too much &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t endeavour, before they have parted with this fir&s;t &s;implicity of the mo&s;t natural mo|tions of the mind, to give them a ta&s;te for cordial and reciprocal friend&s;hip. This purpo&s;e cannot be better promoted than by bringing &s;uch per&s;ons about them as &s;hall never di&s;play any thing har&s;h, fal&s;e, low, or intere&s;ted. It would be right again to command them for any thing they have done out of friend&s;hip, provided it be not very wrong placed or carried too far. Their parents likewi&s;e &s;hould appear full of love and kindne&s;s for them; for children often learn of their own parents to love nothing: and be&s;ides all this, I am even for cut|ting off, in their pre&s;ence, all &s;uperfluous compli|ments to friends, and all &s;orts of fal&s;e care&s;&s;es, as from whence they get a cu&s;tom of paying with empty &s;hews, per&s;ons they ought really to love. There is a defect quite contrary to this we have been &s;peaking of, and which is often to be found in a young woman, and that is, to intere&s;t them|&s;elves pa&s;&s;ionately in matters merely indifferent. They cannot &s;ee two per&s;ons at variance without heartily e&s;pou&s;ing one &s;ide or the other; their af|fections and aver&s;ions run high without proper grounds: in the party they happen to e&s;teem, they can &s;ee no defects, in whom they happen to di&s;|like, no one good quality. Now this is not to be directly oppo&s;ed; for contradiction makes the&s;e fan|cies
<PB N="693" REF="299">
more ob&s;tinate; but we mu&s;t remark by little and little, to the young per&s;on, that we are better acquainted than her with every good quality of her favourite, and with every bad one of the object of her di&s;like: at the &s;ame time, take care to point out, as occa&s;ion &s;erves, the inconvenience of &s;ome defects in the agreeable per&s;on, as well as the con|venience of certain advantageous qualities to be found in the per&s;on under her di&s;plea&s;ure. Do not pre&s;s the matter, you will find &s;he will come to of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This done, lay before her con&s;ideration her &s;trong prejudices in their mo&s;t unrea&s;onable cir|cum&s;tances, and &s;ay gently, that &s;he will hereafter be as &s;en&s;ible of others which at pre&s;ent prevail with her, when they have had their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Relate &s;imilar mi&s;takes of your own at her time of life; but principally demon&s;trate, as clearly as you are able, the great mixture of good and evil in every object of our love or hatred, thereby to abate the inten&s;ene&s;s of her friend&s;hips and aver|&s;ions.</P>
<P>As to rewards which you &s;hall promi&s;e children, never let them con&s;i&s;t in matters of dre&s;s, or any trifling ornaments, it is doing them a double mi&s;|chief; fir&s;t giving them an e&s;teem for what they ought to de&s;pi&s;e, and &s;econdly di&s;abling your&s;elf from e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch things for rewards as would in their nature a&s;&s;i&s;t your endeavours. Be very careful not to threaten them, with obliging them to &s;tudy, and keeping them under certain rules: let as little as po&s;&s;ible be &s;aid about rules; and when there is no avoiding &s;uch a practice, let us get
<PB N="694" REF="300">
into it, without giving any name, but only a rea&s;on drawn from convenience for doing &s;o and &s;o at one certain time, or in one place rather than another.</P>
<P>Were we never to prai&s;e children when they do well, there would be a hazard of di&s;couraging them; therefore, although prai&s;e is &s;omewhat dangerous, on account of conceit, we mu&s;t venture to make u&s;e of it, &s;o far as may animate without making them giddy.</P>
<P>We &s;ee that St. Paul, to encourage the weak, frequently intermixes commendations, that his re|bukes may be more readily received&mdash;the fathers of the church do the &s;ame.

<HEAD>ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of Great Britain, CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through the whole &s;tate of the heptarchy, I find, upon a retro&s;pect of that government, that although particular princes are mentioned and particular atchievements are recited, there &s;till &s;eems wanting a chart of the whole, that at one view may give a li&s;t and de&s;|cription of the monarchs, their reigns, and their religion. Such a map is exhibited in Mr, Guth|rie's Hi&s;tory of England, vol. I. page 126.</P>
<P>How much is it to be regretted, that among &s;uch a number of monarchs, &s;o few acts of great|ne&s;s, policy, juri&s;prudence appear? how intricate and dark, how teizing and immaterial are the &s;e|veral hi&s;torical accounts, from the inva&s;ion of Julius Cae&s;ar, to the reign of Egbert, king of the We&s;t Saxons, and afterwards &s;ole king of England? The hi&s;tory of the Pagans during that period, produces nothing but blood and &s;laughter. The hi&s;tory of the chri&s;tian church, nothing but ridiculous mi|racles and ful&s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;m. All we perceive is, that the &s;everal monarchies were continually at war with each other; the motives and incitement of the&s;e wars &s;carce ever appear. We know that
<PB N="696" REF="302">
there was a general a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of the chief and greate&s;t men in each kingdom: we know that it was called the Wittenagemot, and in that a&s;&s;embly were debated, regulated, and ordered, the affairs of the nation. Such a glimmering of light is very plea&s;ing, as it &s;eems to &s;hew us the ri&s;e and bulwark of our freedom, a parliament. This is almo&s;t the only intere&s;ting point of the heptarchy. The tedious narratives of privileges, revenues, and immunities granted to the church, the endowments of mona&s;teries, and the power of the clergy, are not only unprofitable and di&s;gu&s;ting, but totally u&s;ele&s;s and de&s;picable: at lea&s;t they mu&s;t appear &s;o to the&s;e times, when the pope can &s;carce keep up his authority among the roman catholic &s;tates.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE PRINCESS PADMANI.</HEAD>
<P>AKEBAR, the &s;eventh emperor of the Mo|guls, inherited the virtues and the courage of the illu&s;trious Tamerlane: all the good qualities of the Mogul princes &s;eemed to be united in his per&s;on, almo&s;t without a mixture of tho&s;e vices which make us look upon them as barbarians. There has &s;carce been known a prince of a more penetrating and exten&s;ive judgment, of a more generous and intrepid &s;oul, and at the &s;ame time, tender, compa&s;&s;ionate, and grateful.</P>
<P>Among the many triumphs that marked his glorious reign, the reduction of Chitor was not the lea&s;t con&s;iderable. An Indian Raja, or prince of the race of the famous Rana, who had formerly &s;ubmit|ted to the power of Tamerlane, gave umbrage to Akebar, who could not endure that he &s;hould hold a kind of &s;overeignty in his neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This prince was called Rana, after the name of his ance&s;tors, and boa&s;ted of being lineally de&s;|cended from the antient Porus. The territories of the Raja were not above twelve days journey from Dely; Chitor, the capital of his country, was
<PB N="698" REF="304">
rather a fortre&s;s than a town of trade: it is &s;ituated on a high mountain, &s;urrounded with water on every &s;ide, in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t plain. The top of the mountain on which the town is built is a flat. It is about a league and a half in circum|ference, and half a league over in &s;ome places. At the foot of the mountain, the Nug, a pretty large river, and very deep, glides gently along, a rivulet of the be&s;t water in the world takes its &s;ource in the town, makes a great many windings within it, and at la&s;t having formed &s;everal natural ca&s;cades on the break of the mountain, throws it&s;elf into the river. Within the compa&s;s of the fortre&s;s are &s;everal beautiful fields &s;owed with rice, and watered by the overflowings of the rivulet. It affords provi&s;ions enough to &s;upply a tolerable large garri&s;on. A place inac|ce&s;&s;ible, which wants neither victuals nor water, pa&s;&s;es in the Indies for impregnable. However this was the place which Akebar undertook to conquer.</P>
<P>This young emperor's pa&s;&s;ion for the prince&s;s Padmani, the wi&s;e of Rana, repre&s;ented that en|terprize ea&s;y to him, which every one el&s;e thought impracticable. Before he would attempt &s;o dan|gerous a &s;iege, Akebar, by his amba&s;&s;adors, let Rana under&s;tand, that ambition alone was not the motive of this undertaking, and that he might pre|&s;erve his country from the ruin which threatned it, by giving up the mo&s;t beautiful prince&s;s of the Ea&s;t, to the mo&s;t potent monarch of the world.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al of this kind is not &s;o mocking in the Indies, as it would be in Europe, their laws allow divorce; however, Rana had too much tenderne&s;s for Padmani, to part with her to a rival, and would
<PB N="699" REF="305">
hear nothing more upon that &s;ubject but the dictates of his own valour and the tears of his wife.</P>
<P><Q>Can you find in your heart to abandon me, (&s;ays the virtuous prince&s;s,) to a tyrant whom I dete&s;t? have we not &s;trength enough in Chitor to con&s;ume your enemy's forces, and extingui&s;h his flame, by the length of a fruitle&s;s &s;iege? at wor&s;t, if I mu&s;t lo&s;e my life, I will lo&s;e it without regret, provided I am not &s;o unhappy as to &s;ur|vive you.</Q></P>
<P>Words &s;o moving, determined Rana to prefer an honourable war, to an ignominious peace. He an&s;wered the amba&s;&s;ador of Akebar, that he would not advi&s;e his ma&s;ter to &s;it down before Chitor; but if his pa&s;&s;ion had the a&s;cendant over his rea&s;on, Akebar &s;hould find in the per&s;on of Rana, a true Ragepute, capable of maintaining his rights, and incapable of violating his faith to Pad|mani.</P>
<P>The emperor was &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o haughty a re|ply; he was not accu&s;tomed to meet with any op|po&s;ition to his will, or be cro&s;&s;ed in his de&s;igns.
<Q>Can it be po&s;&s;ible, cried he, that there is a man upon earth that dares di&s;obey me?</Q>
He quickly a&s;&s;embled his victorious troops, which had newly conquered two kingdoms.</P>
<P>Nor was Rana le&s;s adive, but made pre|parations for maintaining a long &s;iege in Chitor: he rouzed up, by his amba&s;&s;adors, the &s;lothful Rajas in his neighbourhood: he gave them to under|&s;tand, that their negligence mu&s;t &s;oon expo&s;e them to the tyranny of a Mahometan; that the Moguls were a race of people but lately arrived in the In|dies,
<PB N="700" REF="306">
and who grew formidable only by the divi&s;ions of the Indians; that if the princes, votaries of Brama, would unite again&s;t the &s;ectaries of Ma|homet, they might ea&s;ily de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Jamee and Tala, both Rajas, and princes of two provinces bordering on Chitor, joined their troops to tho&s;e of Rana, and came in per&s;on to make war again&s;t Akebar. They appeared in the field at the head of their armies; but the Mogul, who advanced by long marches towards Chitor, quickly di&s;per&s;ed them. The two brothers had no other remedy but that of retiring into the &s;trong places of their provinces, and there expect the enemy, who&s;e forces they were not able to with&s;tand in the field.</P>
<P>Never was there &s;een in Indo&s;tan a finer nor a more numerous army than that of the Mogul: he &s;pared no co&s;t to &s;hew him&s;elf before Chitor in the utmo&s;t &s;plendor. The richne&s;s of his tents is hardly to be conceived by us in Europe; all was gold about them. He thought, by his magnifi|cent equipage, to dazzle the Prince&s;s Padmani, and by the number of his troops to frighten Rana into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Akebar found by experience, that virtue and valour are &s;ometimes proof again&s;t the greate&s;t hopes or the greate&s;t fears. The gallant Indians beheld without emotion, from the top of their mountain, the magnificence and prodigious extent of the enemy's camp. The Mogul in the begin|ning of the &s;iege, acted at once the &s;oldier and the lover: he &s;hot arrows into the town which ried letters for Padmani; the prince&s;s took no notice
<PB N="701" REF="307">
of them: he pu&s;hed the &s;iege like one in de&s;pair. He fired terribly upon the place from &s;everal bat|teries; but his cannon &s;hooting upwards, had little or no effect.</P>
<P>The Indians from their ramparts in&s;ulted the Mahometans, and reproached them with their want of bravery, though animated to the fight by more pa&s;&s;ions than one.</P>
<P>A Portugue&s;e hi&s;torian tells us, that the &s;iege of Troy was acted over again in that of Chitor: he adds, that it la&s;ted twelve years, and that Pad|mani had time to grow old, while the Mogul en|deavoured to win her by his arms This is an ex|aggeration which the Mogul Chronocle does not confirm. The &s;iege la&s;ted at mo&s;t but two years, and then concluded by a very extraordinary ad|venture.</P>
<P>Akebar, wearied out by &s;o ob&s;tinate a re&s;i&s;tance, made &s;hew of rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Chitor, and wrote to Rana a very obliging artful letter. He commended the Raja for his courage, but de|&s;ired he would grant him two favours, before he quitted an enterprize which he had undertaken to his confu&s;ion; fir&s;t, that the Raja would give him a &s;ight of the prince&s;s, whom he had not known but by public &s;ame; next, that he would permit him to go into Chitor, and &s;ee the only place in the world capable of re&s;i&s;ting his power.</P>
<P>The Raja granted him the &s;econd demand very freely, but refu&s;ed the fir&s;t. He contented that the Mogul &s;hould enter Chitor, attended by only fifty of his officers, but would not promi&s;e that he &s;hould &s;ee Padmani.</P>
<P><PB N="702" REF="308">Akebar, accepted the Raja's offer; and having received ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, he entered Chitor with a &s;maller number of atten|dants than was allowed him. The emperor re|ceived from Rana all the re&s;pect and all the di|&s;tinction due to his rank. He was regaled in the palace after the Indian manner. The entertain|ment was civil on both &s;ides; but Akebar, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, had the art to make Rana grant him more than he had promi&s;ed. When he &s;aw the Indian warmed with wine, he intreated him to &s;end for Padmani for one moment. The Raja was willing, but they had great difficulty to get the prince&s;s to con|&s;ent. At la&s;t in compliance to her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf, but di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant. This indi&s;cretion of Rana co&s;t him dear: Akebar's pa&s;&s;ion was much more inflamed upon &s;ight of the prince&s;s, however he had command enough over him&s;elf to di&s;&s;emble it: he made Rana believe that he was re&s;olved to rai&s;e the &s;iege from a place which had already given him but too much trouble, and prudently forbore to intermix in his di&s;cour&s;e any prai&s;es of Padmani, but &s;uch as were cold and indifferent.</P>
<P>Rana, thus deceived by appearances, treated his mo&s;t cruel enemy without the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t: he received his pre&s;ents, and gave him others in re|turn. Akebar be&s;towed on the prince a &s;cymetar adorned with diamonds, and Rana made the emperor accept of &s;ome jewels, and now the hour of their part|ing drew near. Akebar walked towards the gate of the fortre&s;s, followed only by forty of his attendants; Rana, to &s;hew his re&s;pect, in&s;i&s;ted upon waiting on
<PB N="703" REF="309">
him to the gate. During their walk, Akebar renew|ed his kind prote&s;tations. At la&s;t they came to the gate of the fortre&s;s, where the Mogul, as a far|ther te&s;timony of his friend&s;hip, would put about the neck of Rana one of tho&s;e large pearl necklaces which in India the men wear as well as the women. He took care to &s;tring it with &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t twi&s;t; and dragged him by this collar out of the gate, while his forty &s;oldiers oppo&s;ed the guard, who made a motion to re&s;cue their prince. The Mogul forced the Indian to mount a hor&s;e; and after having received &s;ome di&s;charges from the mu&s;quets on the ramparts, they conducted Rana alive to the emperor's camp.</P>
<P>In the mean time the uproar made at the gate put the whole town into a con&s;ternation: the peo|ple thought the enemy had &s;urpri&s;ed it; and cer|tainly had the Mogul been but a little better pro|vided with an armed force to &s;econd his de&s;ign, he might ea&s;ily have carried the place.</P>
<P>Fame, which ever magnifies, brought to Pad|mani's ears the news of a &s;udden eruption of the enemy, and that her hu&s;band was mi&s;&s;ing in the tumult. The gallant prince&s;s did not &s;uffer her&s;elf to be overwhelmed with this unexpected di&s;a&s;ter; &s;he immediately got on hor&s;eback, and with her lance in her hand, appeared at the head of her troops, re&s;olved to conquer or die. She did not learn the truth of Akebar's treachery, and the forcing away of Rana, till &s;he came upon the very &s;pot: &s;he perceived plainly enough that &s;he had been the true cau&s;e of his misfortune, but &s;he thought &s;it to conceal that part.
<Q>He is dead, &s;he cried, that, deare&s;t hu&s;band is dead, whom my
<PB N="704" REF="310">
tenderne&s;s has undone. Let us think no more of recovering him by a di&s;honourable compo|&s;ition, but revenge his death by &s;eeing the au|thors of it fall in heaps about us.</Q></P>
<P>Padmani, without &s;hedding a tear, though pierced with the &s;harpe&s;t &s;orrow, walked round the ramparts, gave all the nece&s;&s;ary orders, encou|raged the &s;oldiers, and animated the principal lead|ers. In fine, &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf as much &s;uperior to the men in prudence and courage, as &s;he &s;urpa&s;|&s;ed in beauty all tho&s;e of her own &s;ex.</P>
<P>Akebar had now flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould quickly become ma&s;ter of the fortre&s;s, and gave the be&s;ieged to under&s;tand, that if they did not deliver up the place, and the prince&s;s, he would fir&s;t cau&s;e Rana's head to be &s;truck off, and con|clude his revenge by &s;acking the town, and putting the inhabitants to the &s;word. The brave Amazon an&s;wered, that her hu&s;band having fallen into the hands of a perjured man, &s;he was no longer in doubt of his death; but &s;till there re|mained Rageputes enough of his nation to re|venge their &s;overeign: that for her part, &s;he would employ all the authority heaven had given her over her people, to rai&s;e up to the Mogul enemies yet more formidable than Rana; and that the principal leaders of her army had &s;worn to lo&s;e their lives rather than &s;urrender the place.</P>
<P>Akebar was not ignorant of the firmne&s;s of the Rageputes in all their re&s;olutions; he cho&s;e there|fore to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and endeavour to obtain the prince&s;s by way of negotiation. An amba&s;|&s;ador was &s;ent to Padmani, loaded with rich pre|&s;ents, and the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate letters, Akebar
<PB N="705" REF="311">
repre&s;ented to the prince&s;s, that &s;he had given proofs enough of the fidelity due to her hu&s;band; that it was now time to make &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ion in favour of a great emperor, and her own inte|re&s;t; that her tenderne&s;s for Rana could not bet|ter appear than by procuring the liberty of her captive hu&s;band; that by redeeming Rana from his captivity, &s;he might make her&s;elf the greate&s;t queen in the world.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed her at the &s;ame time letters ex|torted from the captive prince, in which he con|jured her to make her&s;elf happy by &s;etting him at liberty. The heroine rightly apprehended, that Rana's was only a forced con&s;ent, and that her own glory depended upon an inviolable fidelity to him; yet &s;he thought it not unlawful to play the hypocrite, and deceive a deceiver, who had robbed her of her hu&s;band. She let the Mogul under&s;tand, that &s;he began to waver in her re&s;o|lution, and that ambition had &s;haken her con|&s;tancy; that if her vows did not bind her indi&s;|pen&s;ibly to Rana, &s;he would think her&s;elf happy in being &s;ultane&s;s to &s;o great a prince; but that &s;he had &s;worn to her fir&s;t hu&s;band, by all their gods, that &s;he would never be the wife of another, without an expre&s;s con&s;ent from his own mouth; that the emperor might chu&s;e either to &s;uffer Rana to come to Chitor, or permit Padmani to go and demand her hu&s;band's con&s;ent, in the place of his captivity.</P>
<P>Akebar embraced the la&s;t propo&s;al, and con|&s;ented to let the prince&s;s come with a good guard to pay her hu&s;band a vi&s;it. A ca&s;tle in the neigh|bourhood of Agra was Rana's pri&s;on: it is im|po&s;&s;ible

to expre&s;s the impatience of Akebar for the arrival of a prince&s;s at his capital for whom he had expended &s;uch va&s;t trea&s;ures, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;o many dangers. Couriers upon cou|riers were di&s;patched to entreat her not to de|fer her departure. The emperor &s;ent her pre|&s;ents every hour of jewels, fruits, and a my&s;te|rious kind of no&s;egays, which are made u&s;e of in the ea&s;t to expre&s;s, by matching of flowers, the &s;entiments of the heart.</P>
<P>The prince&s;e got ready her equipage with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; the mo&s;t &s;umptuous pallanquins were prepared for her journey. The&s;e are a kind of Indian chai&s;es, in which people of quality are carried on the &s;houlders of ten or a dozen &s;laves; they are long enough to &s;leep in, as in a litter: tho&s;e for the men are open at top; but the wo|men's are clo&s;e, and of a much larger &s;ize. Four may &s;it conveniently in one of them; &s;o that there is need of twenty &s;laves to bear tho&s;e in which the prince&s;&s;es are carried.</P>
<P>Padmani &s;hut up eight of the brave&s;t of her &s;ubjects in the two pallanquins, and enjoined them a profound &s;ilence during the journey; for her own part &s;he remained at Chitor, and &s;ent away the pallanquins with a good guard. The pro|ject was executed with &s;o much &s;ecrecy that the whole town was deceived. The people were all in tears at the &s;uppo&s;ed departure of their prince&s;s, and followed the pallanquins in crouds out of the town. Mean time Padmani keeping very private in her palace, had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the &s;orrow of her people for their imaginary lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="707" REF="313">As &s;oon as the emperor was informed that the prince&s;s was &s;et out for Agra, he appointed &s;eve|ral per&s;ons to meet and compliment her. The prince&s;s's fir&s;t eunuch, who managed the intrigue, and was &s;hut up in the pallanquin, in which the prince&s;s was &s;uppo&s;ed to be, made an&s;wers for her. Among other things, he let the emperor know, in the name of Padmani, that if &s;he met with the lea&s;t interruption in her journey, or was hindered from proceeding directly to her hu&s;band, without going through the capital; or even, if &s;he was di&s;turbed in her conver&s;ation with Rana, that &s;he was determined to &s;tab her&s;elf with a dagger which &s;he brought for that purpo&s;e, and held ready in her hand for fear of any &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Akebar had not a thought of making the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition to the prince&s;s's will. He &s;ent her word, that &s;he &s;hould be at full liberty to &s;ee Rana, to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and bid him adieu. The nearer the pallanquins approached Agra, the more couriers were di&s;patched to wait on them. They were met by them at every village, and &s;till the eunuch gave an&s;wers to the letters of Akebar. About half a day's journey from Agra, and three or four leagues from the ca&s;tle where Rana was pri&s;oner, they met a magnificent equipage, which the emperor had &s;ent to receive the prince&s;s. The Rageputes arrived about the evening at the place where Rana was pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The two pallanquins only, and &s;ome officers of Padmani's guard, were permitted to enter the ca&s;tle; the&s;e officers, together with the Rageputes &s;hut up in the pallanquins, di&s;patched the governor of the ca&s;tle, who fir&s;t advanced to receive the prince&s;s;
<PB N="708" REF="314">
afterwards becoming matters of the guard, they delivered Rana from his impri&s;onment. They mounted him on a very fleet hor&s;e; and, as they had po&s;ted change enough on the road, the raja &s;oon arrived at Chitor, where he made Padmani all the acknowledgments due to his deliverer.</P>
<P>Mean time Akebar was waiting impatiently in a garden for the arrival of the prince&s;s. When word was brought him that Rana had made his e&s;cape, and that &s;ome armed men had been con|cealed in the pallanquins in&s;tead of Padmani, he commanded the me&s;&s;enger's head to be &s;truck off who brought this news; but coming to him&s;elf a moment after, he was contented to forbid him his pre&s;ence for ever. "Pur&s;ue, pur&s;ue Rana," cries he; but Rana was got too far on his road to be overtaken. As to the Rageputes, who had &s;erved as a convoy to the pallanquins, after having marched all night with great expedition, they found them|&s;elves about the morning in the territories of a raja, and a friend to the prince of Chitor, and at la&s;t got &s;afe into their own country.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Rana was returned to his fortre&s;s, he wrote an in&s;ulting letter to Akebar; he reproached him with his perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and rallied him on the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his amours; he haughtily defied him to come a &s;econd time to try his fortune again&s;t the citadel of Chitor; and added, that after having been baffled and outwitted by a woman, he might very well expect to be vanqui&s;hed by an army of Rageputes, who waited his arrival with impatience. Rana did more than in&s;ult his enemy with letters; he erected in the market-place of Chitor a pillar, on which were engraven the&s;e words, <HI>Never tru&s;t the Moguls who have betrayed you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="709" REF="315">The behaviour of Rana, and the indifference of the prince&s;s Padmani, provoked Akebar to &s;uch a degree, that he was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. Once more he a&s;&s;embled his troops; he augmented his artillery; he prepared machines; in a word, he made &s;uch provi&s;ion for the &s;iege of Chitor, that he believed the taking of it infallible. In this a&s;|&s;urance he &s;urrounded the place on every &s;ide; he rai&s;ed platforms, on which he planted his engines: the a&s;&s;aults were furious, and were equally &s;u&s;|tained.</P>
<P>The Mogul was now no more that amorous prince, who &s;eemed tender of the lives of his prince&s;s's people; but an emperor enraged to the la&s;t degree, who came to avenge a per&s;onal affront. The two principals were continually attentive; one to pu&s;h the &s;iege, and the other to defeat it. Rana &s;carce ever quitted the ramparts, where he encour|aged his men, and repaired the breaches. Akebar, on his &s;ide, often mounted the platforms, and gave his orders for forming the attacks. One day as Akebar was taking a view of the place from one of tho&s;e platforms, almo&s;t equal in heighth with the walls of Chitor, he perceived an officer walk|ing carele&s;ly on the ramparts; he took aim with his fu&s;ee, and &s;hot the raja dead upon the &s;pot. Two days after the emperor had an account that he had killed his rival; that his body was burned in great pomp; and that the generous Padmani, according to the cu&s;tom of the Ragepute prince&s;|&s;es, had thrown her&s;elf into the flames, and mingled her a&s;hes with tho&s;e of her hu&s;band. Chitor &s;till made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance; but at la&s;t was forced to yield to the valour and fortune of Akebar.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DESCRIPTION of the I&s;land of CEYLON. [Continued from Page 480.]</HEAD>
<P>THIS country, though mountainous, is wa|tered by a great number of very fine rivers which fall from the mountains:&mdash;mo&s;t of them are too full of rocks to be navigable, but they contain fi&s;h in great abundance. The river of Mavelagongue, which is the principal of them, has its &s;ource in the Picus Adami, of which we &s;hall give a de&s;cription hereafter; it traver&s;es the whole i&s;land towards the north, and falls into the &s;ea at Trinquemale. Its breadth is about a cro&s;s bow &s;hot: the rocks, which render it very little navigable, afford harbour and retreat to a great number of alligators. It runs within a quarter of a league of the town of Candi; but as the rapi|dity of its waters will not admit of any bridge being built over it, it can only be cro&s;&s;ed in little canoes. It is moreover a point of policy among&s;t the inhabitants, who are far from de&s;irous to ren|der travelling commodious in their country; but rather chu&s;e to embarra&s;s the roads as much as po&s;&s;ible. In &s;ome places this river flows for leagues together without meeting any interruption from the rocks. But the Ceylone&s;e in general reap very little advantages from the waters, either in the way of commerce, or for the conveyance of goods.</P>
<P><PB N="711" REF="317">Excepting the province of Ouvah, and the di&s;|tricts of Oudipollat and Dolusbang, the whole i&s;land is covered with wood. It is well peopled about the centre, but very indifferently towards the borders. The inhabitants do indeed &s;hew many places where they pretend heretofore to have had very con&s;iderable cities, the names of which the places retain to this day; but there are &s;carcely the ve&s;tiges of any buildings remaining in them. Knox, who traver&s;ed the i&s;land &s;eve|ral times, takes notice of only five which can de&s;erve that title; and in which the king has pa|laces, although they are all in ruins, excepting that which he particularly inhabits. Of the&s;e ci|ties Candi, or Conde, is the chief. It has the advantage of being placed in the centre of the i&s;land; &s;o that it may be approached with equal facility from every part of it. Its form is trian|gular; and, according to the cu&s;tom of the coun|try, the king's palace occupies the ea&s;tern angle of it. It is fortified only to the &s;outh, becau&s;e the acce&s;s to it is more open there than from any other quarter. This fortification, however, is nothing more than a rampart of earth about twenty feet high, which cro&s;&s;es the valley from one mountain to another. All the avenues to the city, for two or three miles di&s;tance, are clo&s;ed up with barriers of thorn, and a continual guard always kept at them; and the great river which comes down from the Picus Adami, pa&s;&s;es within a quarter of a league of it towards the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The next city is Nellemby-neur, about twelve miles &s;outh of the preceding. Allout-neur &s;tands to the north-ea&s;t of Candi, where the king keeps
<PB N="712" REF="318">
large magazines of corn and rice in re&s;erve again&s;t the time of war. Badoula, which is the fourth city, is two days journey from Candi, towards the ea&s;t of the province of Ouvah. In this pro|vince the be&s;t tobacco in the i&s;land is cultivated: it is very well watered; but wood is &s;carce in it. Rice and cattle, however, are in abundance in it; with re&s;pect to which, however, this very &s;ingu|lar circum&s;tance is ob&s;ervable, that the cattle reared there cannot live for any con&s;iderable time when tran&s;ported into any other province: the occa&s;ion of which, is attributed to a certain &s;hrub, which is found in all the other provinces, and not in this.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t of the&s;e cities is Digligy|neur, &s;ituated al&s;o to the ea&s;t of Candi. In this city the king has kept his court ever &s;ince the year 1664, when a revolt of his &s;ubjects drove him to quit Candi; and with his departure began the ruin of that city. It is &s;ituated in the province of Hevoiattay, a country which is covered with mountains and rocks, that render the &s;oil of it extremely infertile. Yet has the king cho&s;en it for his re&s;idence, as a place of &s;ecurity, by being in the neighbourhood of a very high mountain cal|led Gauldua, which may, on any occa&s;ion, afford him a &s;afe retreat; and where as much rice may be gathered as will amply maintain the garri&s;on of three forts, which defend the entrance to it. It is extremely &s;leep on all &s;ides; and &s;o inve&s;ted with rocks, woods, and precipices, that a hand|ful of men might &s;tand their ground there again&s;t very numerous armies.</P>
<P><PB N="713" REF="319">As to the towns and villages of Ceylon, altho' they are very numerous, there are few of them that are worth a traveller's attention. The mo&s;t remarkable are tho&s;e which are con&s;ecrated to their idols, in which &s;ome of their Devals, or temples, may be &s;een. The inhabitants give them&s;elves very little trouble about making their &s;treets &s;trait, or pre&s;erving any regularity in their hou&s;es; each family living in a &s;eperate building, which is mo&s;t u&s;ually &s;urrounded with a hedge and ditch. The Ceylone&s;e never build in the high road, as they do not chu&s;e to be ob&s;erved by pa&s;&s;engers. Their large&s;t villages do not contain above a hundred hou&s;es. Their u&s;ual number is about forty or fifty, although there are &s;ome which con&s;i&s;t of only eight or ten. Be&s;ides which, they quit them whenever &s;ickne&s;s happens to be in any degree frequent among&s;t them, or that two or three peo|ple chance to die within any &s;mall &s;pace of time. They then imagine that the devil has taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, and therefore immediately abandon their lands and habitations, in order to go in &s;earch of &s;ome more fortunate dwelling.</P>
<P>The king's palace at Digligy-neur, is &s;urrounded with a rampart of earth, ca&s;ed with thatch, to prevent the rain's beating it down. This inclo|&s;ure is full of various irregular buildings, mo&s;t of them low, and covered with &s;tubble, excepting &s;ome few, who&s;e roofs are tiled. The&s;e latter have two &s;tories, with open galleries round them to let in air, &s;urrounded with ballu&s;ters, &s;ome of ebo|ny, and others of painted wood. The windows al&s;o are inlaid with plates of &s;ilver and ebony; and the top of each edifice adorned with va&s;es
<PB N="714" REF="320">
of earth, or more&s;que. The&s;e &s;everal buildings form a kind of labyrinth, to which there are a great number of very hand&s;ome gates, two of which have draw-bridges to them. The porti|coes of the&s;e are of a mo&s;t admirable relief; and, even to the very locks and bolts, are decorated with carved work. At each of the&s;e doors, and at every pa&s;&s;age, are placed centinels, which are regularly relieved day and night.</P>
<P>The common hou&s;es of the inhabitants are little, low, and thatched. Nor are they allowed to build them with more than one &s;tory, nor to cover them with tiles, nor even to whiten the walls of them with lime, though they have a kind of white clay which they might employ with advan|tage to this u&s;e. As the country is very hot, they for the mo&s;t part neglect the plai&s;tering of their walls, contenting them&s;elves with the branches and leaves of trees. They have not even chim|neys in their hou&s;es, but make what fire is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the preparation of their victuals, in a corner of their apartment, which blackens the floor very much. The grandees have hou&s;es very hand&s;ome and commodious, con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t part of two buildings oppo&s;ite to each other, and united by a wall, which forms a &s;quare court. The&s;e walls are &s;urrounded with borders of clay, rubbed over with cow dung, which renders them impenetrable by the rain. Their dome&s;tics and &s;laves inhabit the hou&s;es round them.</P>
<P>As to the temperature of the air, it is very unwhol&s;ome in the &s;outhern parts, though all the re&s;t of the country enjoys a very pure and healthy air. The vallies are, for the mo&s;t part, mar&s;hy,
<PB N="715" REF="321">
and full of fine &s;prings. Tho&s;e which have the&s;e qualities are looked on as the be&s;t, becau&s;e the rice, which is the principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the in|habitants, requires a great deal of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The variety which is ob&s;erved in the air and rains in the different parts of this i&s;land are very remarkable:&mdash;when the we&s;t winds begin to blow, the we&s;tern parts have great falls of rain, and this is the proper &s;ea&s;on to plough and till the ground; and yet at the very &s;ame time the ea&s;tern parts of the i&s;land enjoy very dry weather, and gather in their harve&s;t:&mdash;On the contrary, when the wind blows from the ea&s;t, they plough and till in the ea&s;terly parts, and gather in the corn in the oppo&s;ite ones, towards the we&s;t.&mdash;Thus the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of ploughing and harve&s;t employs the i&s;|landers almo&s;t all the year round in different &s;ea|&s;ons of the year.</P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of rain and drought is made about the middle of the i&s;land; and it frequently hap|pens that there is rain on one &s;ide of the moun|tain of Cauragahing, whil&s;t it is extremely hot and dry on the other &s;ide of it. It is al&s;o re|marked, that this difference is no le&s;s violent than it is &s;udden: for on the quitting a very wet &s;pot of ground, you &s;hall come immediately into a &s;oil the heat of which &s;hall &s;corch and burn your feet.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, however, are not &s;ubject to this great quantity of wet wea|ther:&mdash;for there will &s;ometimes continue there for three or four years together &s;o great and con&s;tant a drought, that the ground &s;hall be incapable of
<PB N="716" REF="322">
receiving any kind of culture. It is even difficult to dig any wells thereabouts deep enough to get water that can be drank; and even the very be&s;t that is to be got retains an acrimony and brack|i&s;hne&s;s, which renders it extremely di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh of Candi, and at about four|teen or fifteen leagues from Colombo, is a moun|tain, which is looked on as the highe&s;t in the i&s;land, and which, from its height and form, which is nearly that of a &s;ugar-loaf, is very di&s;tinctly to be &s;een not only all through the i&s;land, but even at upwards of a dozen miles out at &s;ea. This is the famous Picus Adami, whereof all the travellers, who have ever been in this country, have &s;poken with &s;o much admiration. On a large flat &s;tone, which is at the top of it, is an impre&s;&s;ion re&s;em|bling that of a man's foot, but upwards of twice the natural &s;ize of one. The general &s;uper&s;tition is, that this mark was left there by the foot of our fir&s;t parent; from whom therefore the mountain receives its name. In &s;hort, were we to recount all the fabulous things that the Ceylone&s;e introduce in their hi&s;tory of this mountain, it would be only abu&s;ing the patience of our fair readers.&mdash; let it &s;uffice then to give a plain de&s;cription of the place, &s;uch as it is, only adding, that the&s;e peo|ple look on it as a meritorious action to go and pay their adorations to this foot; e&s;pecially on the fir&s;t day of the year, which falls with them in the month of March: at which time are to be &s;een immen&s;e proce&s;&s;ions of men, women, and children, who have undertaken this pilgrimage.</P>
<P><PB N="717" REF="323">Before you come then to the foot of the mountain, you meet with a very large and plea|&s;ant plain, watered with a great many rills which fall from the Pic, and form at the bottom of it a pool to which the Gentiles frequently make a pilgrimage, never failing to bathe them&s;elves in it, and wa&s;h their cloaths and linen al&s;o therein, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that that water has a virtue to efface all their &s;ins. After this fir&s;t act of &s;uper|&s;tition, they clamber to the top of the mountain, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of iron chains affixed thereto; and without which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to get up, &s;o very &s;teep is it, although there have been &s;teps wrought out in many parts of it. The way to the top is at lea&s;t a quarter of a league. At a certain di&s;tance from the &s;ummit are erected two &s;tone pillars, &s;urmounted by another &s;tone, which lies acro&s;s them, and to which is &s;u&s;pended a large bell, made of metal, having its clapper pierced with a hole big enough to pa&s;s an iron thong through it, which all the pilgrims are obliged to pull, and &s;triking one &s;troke on the bell to try whether they are purified; becau&s;e the&s;e idolaters imagine, that if they are not &s;o, the bell will give no &s;ound. This imaginary misfortune, how|ever, never happens to them. The &s;ummit of the mountain pre&s;ents a plain &s;urface, of an hun|dred and fifty paces in length, and an hundred and ten in breadth; in the middle of which is the flat &s;tone which it is &s;aid bears the impre&s;&s;ion of a gigantic human foot, two palms long, and eight inches broad. There are &s;ome trees planted about this &s;tone; and to the left of it are a few huts, whither the pilgrims retire. On the right

hand there was formerly a very fine pagod, whereof the Ceylone&s;e relate wonders; and Baldeus de|&s;cribes &s;ixty-eight &s;tatues and figures, which are to be met with in different cavities of the moun|tain.

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY of CEYLON.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land produces a great quantity of rice: in the cultivation of which the indu&s;try of the inhabitants renders it&s;elf extremely con&s;picuous; for when we come to con&s;ider how nece&s;&s;ary wa|ter is in the culture of that grain, and at the &s;ame time recollect that great part of the i&s;land is ex|tremely mountainous, it will appear wonderful that it &s;hould be &s;o fertile as it is. The manner, however, that the Ceylone&s;e have contrived for rendering it &s;o, is by levelling the &s;ides of the&s;e mountains at certain &s;tages, from three to eight feet in breadth, &s;o as to form a kind of &s;tairca&s;e from the bottom of the hill to the uppermo&s;t of the&s;e &s;tages, in which they &s;ow their rice. Now as the i&s;land is very much vi&s;ited with rain, and that there is be&s;ides a great frequency of &s;prings on the mountains, they have found means to dig large re&s;ervoirs nearly on a level with the highe&s;t &s;prings; from whence the water is made to fall on the uppermo&s;t rows, and from them gradually to the others, &s;o as to keep them con|tinually &s;upplied with water. Some of the&s;e re|&s;ervoirs are half a league in length, &s;ome le&s;s, and their depth u&s;ually from two to three yards.</P>
<P><PB N="719" REF="325">There are &s;everal kinds of rice di&s;tingui&s;hable in the i&s;land of Ceylon, which are defined by dif|ferent names, although they differ very little in their ta&s;te; and indeed &s;carcely in any thing more than the length of time they take in ripening. Some is &s;even months in coming to perfection, whil&s;t &s;ome will ripen at &s;ix, five, four, or three months end. That which is &s;oone&s;t ripe is the be&s;t ta&s;ted; but does not yield &s;o plentifully. There is even a kind which ripens in dry ground, and is therefore &s;owed in tho&s;e places where it is not in the power of art to convey water. This would be a very great trea&s;ure to the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern parts, were it not much inferior to the other kinds both in ta&s;te and &s;mell.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rice, this i&s;land furni&s;hes various &s;orts of grain; which, although by no means ap|proaching to it in goodne&s;s, are neverthele&s;s a very good re&s;ource in times of &s;carcity. They have al&s;o great quantities of excellent fruits; but they might reap much more advantage from them, if they were &s;ufficiently fond of them, to be&s;tow &s;ome care on their cultivation. But as they pay very little regard to tho&s;e which have nothing agreeable in them but their ta&s;te, and cannot &s;erve them by way of food when the grain is at any time deficient, the only trees which they plant are tho&s;e that produce nutritive fruits. The other kinds grow of them&s;elves: and what &s;till dimi|ni&s;hes the care of the inhabitants, is, that in all places where nature produces any delicious fruits, the officers of the country tie a label round the tree in the king's name, with three knots at the
<PB N="720" REF="326">
end of it; which being done, no one dares touch it, without running the hazard of a very &s;evere puni&s;hment, and &s;ometimes even of death. The fruit when ripe is generally carried in a white linen cloth to the governor of the province; who, &s;electing the fine&s;t, wraps it up in another linen cloth, and &s;ends it to court, keeping the re&s;t for him&s;elf, and returning none to the proprietors.</P>

<P>What a pity it is, madam, that we cannot at the &s;ame time when we abhor the &s;uper&s;titions of po|pery, retain that veneration, I had almo&s;t &s;aid duty, to cele&s;tial warnings, which, no longer ago than the prote&s;tant reign of good queen Anne, I can very well remember, had an influence over every action of our lives.</P>
<P>It was then, madam, that a winding-&s;heet in the candle, or a cinder coffin jumping out of the fire, &s;ent many a wicked maid to her prayers and re|pentance for a whole week together.</P>
<P>It was then, madam, that doctor Aaron Sand|ford, the &s;tar-gazing haberda&s;her, of Bednal green, and doctor Duncan Campbell, the deaf and dumb conjurer, in Buckingham Court, were followed and revered with as true devotion as the methodi&s;ts are in the&s;e wicked days.</P>
<P>Witches indeed have pretty well kept their ground, notwith&s;tanding the thunder of an act of parliament, and the execution of poor Thomas Colley, only for &s;tifling Ruth O&s;borne, the witch of Tring, in a pond of water. It is not &s;ix months ago &s;ince I read an account in one of the news-pa|pers of a witch in Northumberland. The be&s;t peo|ple in the pari&s;h a&s;&s;embled to take her; they &s;ur|rounded

her hou&s;e boldly, and in a body; they bur&s;t open the door, but they found &s;he was flown, probably up the chimney, and upon a broom&s;tick.</P>
<P>My mother and my grandmother have often in|formed me of many wonderful noi&s;es, apparitions, and vi&s;ions, that have been &s;een and heard in our family. My honoured parents were not only pious matrons but great believers; and &s;hall I degenerate? All good &s;tars forbid! yet I fore&s;ee that with me mu&s;t die the u&s;ual family-veneration for &s;uperna|tural cau&s;es.</P>
<P>My two grand-daughters are incorrigibly ob|&s;tinate and carele&s;s: they give each other knives and &s;ci&s;&s;ars, without con&s;idering the con&s;equence, that &s;uch kind of in&s;truments invi&s;ibly cut love and affection. Sukey, the elde&s;t, never fails to quit the room as &s;oon as I begin to read my fate in coffee-grounds, and her &s;i&s;ter Nancy &s;eems not to pay the lea&s;t regard to Childermas-day.</P>
<P>What can I do? pray madam, a&s;&s;i&s;t me in cor|recting the&s;e two girls, and in teaching them to &s;tand in awe of &s;pirits, hobgoblins, fairies, death-watches, and Will i'the wi&s;p.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thought that &s;truck the amazed So|phia was, that Sir Charles, either following the motions of his natural incon&s;tancy, or in re|venge of her &s;uppo&s;ed contempt of him, had mar|ried Harriot. Certain that &s;he had now lo&s;t for ever this lover, who with all his real or imputed faults, &s;he had never been able to bani&s;h from her heart, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf up to the &s;harpe&s;t ago|nies of de&s;pair, and had already arrived at her &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e before &s;he was able to &s;top the cour&s;e of her tears.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant in the livery of her own family opened the door. This circum&s;tance &s;urpri&s;ed Sophia, who pulling her hat over her eyes to conceal her di&s;|order, a&s;ked him, with &s;ome he&s;itation, if his mi&s;tre&s;s was at home.</P>
<P>The fellow replied, he believed &s;he was, and opening the coach-door, &s;hewed her into a parlour, telling her, with a &s;mart air, that he would enquire of his lady's woman whether &s;he was vi&s;ible yet or no.</P>
<P><PB N="725" REF="331">Sophia having &s;ummoned all her fortitude to enable her to go through this &s;evere trial with dig|nity, had time enough to recollect and compo&s;e her&s;elf before any one appeared; and now &s;everal circum&s;tances ru&s;hed upon her memory which in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her a&s;toni&s;hmentt and grief had e&s;caped her attention.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, in her letter, had not mentioned Harriot's marriage, but barely &s;aid &s;he had left her. The &s;ervant who delivered her me&s;&s;age called her mi&s;s Darnley; and though &s;he lived in a hou&s;e that belonged to Sir Charles, yet it was &s;carcely &s;uitable to the quality of his wife.</P>
<P>A few moments reflection upon the&s;e appear|ances made the generous Sophia change the ob|ject of her concern. The misfortune for which &s;he had grieved &s;o much, &s;eemed light, compared with that &s;he apprehended: &s;he wept no longer for the incon&s;tancy of her lover; &s;he trembled for the ho|nour of her &s;i&s;ter; and her greate&s;t fear now was, that Sir Charles was not married.</P>
<P>While &s;he was ab&s;orbed in the&s;e melancholy thoughts, Harriot's maid entered the room, who after glancing over Sophia, with a &s;upercilious eye, (for &s;he was very &s;imply dre&s;t,) a&s;ked her,
<Q>If &s;he had any bu&s;ine&s;s with her lady.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tell her, replied Sophia, that her &s;i&s;ter is here.</Q></P>
<P>The girl blu&s;hed, courte&s;ied, and flew to ac|quaint her mi&s;tre&s;s; and Sophia was in&s;tantly de|&s;ired to walk up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>She found Harriot in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, in an elegant di&s;habille, having ju&s;t fini&s;hed her mor|ning's
<PB N="726" REF="332">
work, which appeared in a &s;uit of ribbons made up with great ta&s;te.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw Sophia, &s;he ro&s;e from her chair, and &s;aluted her with affected dignity; but at the &s;ame time with an air of embarra&s;&s;ment that encrea&s;ed every moment: &s;o that being unable to bear the &s;weet but penetrating looks of her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he re&s;umed her work, altering and unripping, without any apparent de&s;ign, yet affecting to be extremely bu&s;y, and to &s;hew how perfectly &s;he was at ea&s;e, talked of the mo&s;t trifling matters ima|ginable, while Sophia gazed on her in &s;ilent an|gui&s;h, anxious to know the truth of her &s;ituation, yet dreading to have it explained. At length &s;he told her that &s;he was going to Ken&s;ington to her mother, and de&s;ired to know if &s;he had any me&s;|&s;age to &s;end to her.</P>
<P>Harriot &s;uddenly interupting her, as if &s;he fear|ed &s;ome further que&s;tions, began to exclaim a|gain&s;t her mother's unrea&s;onable temper, &s;aying, that &s;he had offended her violently only becau&s;e &s;he had it not in her power to comply with &s;ome very extravagant expectations which &s;he had formed.</P>
<P><Q>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia, I am wholly ignorant of your affairs; I know not what cau&s;e of di&s;con|tent you have given my mother, but I &s;ee there is a great alteration in your condition of life, and I hope&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>What do you hope, pray mi&s;s? interrupted Harriot, reddening: I &s;uppo&s;e I am to have &s;ome of your &s;atirical flings; your temper is not altered I find.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="727" REF="333">
<Q>Dear Harriot, re&s;umed Sophia, with tears in her eyes, this cau&s;ele&s;s anger confirming her &s;u&s;|picions, why do you reproach me with being &s;atirical? is it a crime to be anxious for your happine&s;s?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I wi&s;h you would not trouble your&s;elf about me, replied Harriot, I know be&s;t what will make me happy; you &s;hould not pretend to in&s;truct your elders, mi&s;s Sophy; I am older than you; you know, you have often upbraided me with that.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sophia calmly, you de&s;ired to &s;ee me, have you any thing to &s;ay to me?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I know, an&s;wered Harriot, that I &s;hall meet with ungrateful returns for my kindne&s;s, never|thele&s;s I &s;hall act like a &s;i&s;ter towards you, and it was to tell you &s;o that I wi&s;hed to &s;ee you: I very much doubt whether, if you were in pro&s;perity, you would do the &s;ame by me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Have I behaved &s;o ill in adver&s;ity then, &s;aid Sophia, that you form this har&s;h judgment of me, &s;i&s;ter?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray don't upbraid me with your behaviour, mi&s;s, &s;aid Harriot; other people may have be|haved as well as you, though they are not prudes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You &s;ay you are in pro&s;perity, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid So|phia, but perhaps you and I have different no|tions of pro&s;perity: let me know the truth of your &s;ituation, and if I find you happy accord|ing to my notions of happine&s;s, you will &s;oon be convinced that I can take a &s;i&s;ter's &s;hare in it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="728" REF="334">
<Q>I am not obliged to give an account of my conduct to you, replied Harriot, who had li&s;tened to this &s;peech with great emotion; and I mu&s;t tell you, &s;i&s;ter Sophy, that if you go on taking this liberty of que&s;tioning and cen&s;uring me, I &s;hall not care how &s;eldom I &s;ee you. As to my mother, I know that it is my duty to do every thing for her that is in my power; and this I have offered to do already.</Q></P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he rang the bell, and her maid ap|pearing, &s;he gave her &s;ome orders which nece&s;&s;a|rily required her attendance in the room; &s;o that Sophia, finding &s;he could have no further di&s;|cour&s;e with her &s;i&s;ter, ro&s;e up and took leave of her with an aching heart. Her griefs all aggra|vated by the apprehen&s;ion of her &s;i&s;ter's di&s;honour, and the hatred which &s;he felt for Sir Charles, as her &s;educer, &s;truggling with a tender remembrance, her gentle bo&s;om was torn with conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;he proved but too well the truth of that maxim, That philo&s;ophy ea&s;ily triumphs over pa&s;t and future evils, but the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> triumph over her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley received her daughter with unu|&s;ual tenderne&s;s: &s;he felt how much &s;he &s;tood in need of her filial care; and her behaviour was dic|tated by that intere&s;ted kindne&s;s which only gives in expectation of receiving back doublefold.</P>
<P>Sophia &s;aw her pale and emaciated, and was greatly affected with the &s;ight: &s;he would not mention her &s;i&s;ter, for fear of di&s;compo&s;ing her; but Mrs. Darnley &s;oon introduced the &s;ubject that was mo&s;t in her thoughts, and exclaimed again&s;t
<PB N="729" REF="335">
Harriot's undutifulne&s;s and want of affection with the mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>I have been the be&s;t of mothers to her, &s;aid &s;he, melting into tears; I have always indulged her in all her wi&s;hes, and impaired my circum|&s;tances to &s;upport her extravagancies, and how has &s;he returned this kindne&s;s! would you think it, my dear Sophy, though &s;he is in affluent cir|cum&s;tances, and I, by the lo&s;s of my annuity, am plunged into all my former di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he has refu&s;ed to pay tho&s;e debts which I contracted during the time &s;he lived with me; and thinks it &s;ufficient to invite me to re&s;ide in her hou&s;e, where, no doubt, I &s;hould feel my dependence &s;everely.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Charles, &s;aid Sophia &s;ighing, does not act with his u&s;ual genero&s;ity; if he has married my &s;i&s;ter, why does he &s;uffer you to be in di|&s;tre&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>"Married your &s;i&s;ter!" repeated Mrs. Darnley, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><Q>Ah, madam, re&s;umed Sophia, is &s;he not mar|ried then to Sir Charles?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why, is it po&s;&s;ible that you can wi&s;h him to be married to Harriot?</Q>
&s;aid Mrs. Darnley.</P>
<P><Q>Alas! cried Sophia, ought I not to wi&s;h it, when I &s;ee her in his hou&s;e?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh, re&s;umed Mrs. Darnley, I perceive your mi&s;take; but that hou&s;e is not Sir Charles's now; Lord L&mdash; bought it of him, with the fur|niture, &s;ome time ago; it might have been yours, and without any offence to your virtue too, yet you thought fit to refu&s;e it: but I
<PB N="730" REF="336">
will not pretend to reprove one &s;o much wi&s;er than my&s;elf&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, madam, interrupted Sophia eagerly, then it is not to Sir Charles that my &s;i&s;ter is married, to whom is &s;he married?</Q></P>
<P>"You have &s;een her, have you not?" &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, looking a little confu&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>I have indeed &s;een her, &s;aid Sophia, but &s;he did not explain her &s;ituation to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And do you imagine, re&s;umed Mrs. Darnley peevi&s;hly, that &s;he would be le&s;s re&s;erved with her mother? and if &s;he was afraid of telling you the truth, is it likely &s;he would own it to me?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then I fear it is bad indeed with Harriot, cried Sophia, in a melancholy accent, &s;ince &s;he has &s;o much to conceal from a mother and a &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You were always cen&s;orious, Sophy, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion; for my part, I am re&s;olved to think the be&s;t. If Lord L&mdash;is married privately to your &s;i&s;ter, her character will one day be cleared to the world, and &s;he thinks no prudent per&s;on can blame her, for chu&s;ing to bear for a time a few unde&s;erved cen&s;ures, rather than to &s;truggle with poverty and contempt.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, now convinced of Harriot's unhappy conduct, bur&s;t into tears. Mrs. Darnley after look|ing at her in &s;ilence a moment, &s;aid, with &s;ome confu&s;ion;
<Q>Then you do not believe your &s;i&s;ter is married, Sophy?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah, madam, replied Sophia, you do not &s;ay that you know &s;he is, and whatever rea&s;ons there
<PB N="731" REF="337">
might be for concealing her marriage from the world, certainly there are none for hiding it from you.&mdash;In vain, added &s;he, with &s;till greater emotion, would your parental tenderne&s;s &s;eek to deceive your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Reproach me no more with my tenderne&s;s for your &s;i&s;ter, interrupted Mrs. Darnley, angrily; I am too much affected with her ingratitude al|ready.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am &s;orry &s;he is ungrateful, &s;aid Sophia; but oh! my dear mama, it is not fit you &s;hould ac|cept of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, calling down her eyes, that I know what is fit for me to do as well as my daughter.&mdash;But Sophy, added &s;he, after a little pau&s;e, I am &s;orry to tell you, if you do not know it already, that if you have &s;till any thoughts of Sir Charles, you deceive your&s;elf; I am very well informed, that a match has been propo&s;ed to him, and he has given &s;o favourable an an&s;wer, that it is expected the marriage will be concluded, as &s;oon as he comes from Paris: I heard it all from one of the young lady's rela|tions.</Q></P>
<P>This was a &s;evere &s;troke to poor Sophia, who had ju&s;t begun to breathe again, after the angui&s;h &s;he had &s;uffered, in the belief that Sir Charles had for|&s;aken her for her &s;i&s;ter, and added perfidy and ba&s;ene&s;s to his incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, who &s;aw her turn pale, and her eyes &s;wimming in tears, while &s;he &s;truggled to con|ceal her emotions, could not help being affected
<PB N="732" REF="338">
with her di&s;tre&s;s, and endeavoured to con&s;ole her.</P>
<P>Sophia, more &s;oftened by this tenderne&s;s, &s;uffer|ed her tears to flow a few moments unre&s;trained; then &s;uddenly wiping her charming eyes,
<Q>Par|don this weakne&s;s, madam, &s;aid &s;he; this indeed is not a time to weep for my&s;elf, your &s;orrows claim all my tears.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Aye, I have &s;orrows enough, Heaven knows, &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, my debts unpaid, my annuity gone, what have I to tru&s;t to?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Providence, interrupted Sophia, your piety and my indu&s;try. Alas! my dear mama, your greate&s;t affliction is not the lo&s;s of your annuity, or the debts with which you are encumbered, it is my &s;i&s;ter's unhappy fall from virtue. That parent, pur&s;ued &s;he, who &s;ees a beloved child become a prey to licentious pa&s;&s;ions, who &s;ees her publicly incur &s;hame and reproach, expel|led the &s;ociety of the good and virtuous, and lead a life of di&s;honour, embittered with the contempt of the world, and the &s;ecret upbraidings of her own con&s;cience; that parent can be&s;t judge of your angui&s;h now: I have only a &s;i&s;ter's feelings for this misfortune! but the&s;e feelings are &s;trong enough to make me very unhappy.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley appeared &s;o much moved with this di&s;cour&s;e, that Sophia pur&s;ued it, till &s;he brought her mother to declare, that &s;he would rather &s;uffer all the inconveniencies of poverty, than give a &s;anction to Harriot's guilt, by partak|ing of its reward.</P>
<P><PB N="733" REF="339">Sophia, to relieve her anxiety, laid down a plan for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and proved to her, that by her &s;kill in &s;everal little u&s;eful arts, it would be ea&s;y for her to &s;upply her with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. "We will fir&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, pay your debts."</P>
<P>"How is that to be done?" &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, ha&s;tily.</P>
<P><Q>The furniture of your hou&s;e, &s;aid Sophia, the plate, and other pieces of finery, which Sir Charles Stanley pre&s;ented to you, will, if con|verted into money, not only pay your debts, but provide a little fund for pre&s;ent expences, and a re&s;erve for future exigencies; mean while, my indu&s;try and care will, I hope, keep want far from you. I have friends, who will find em|ployment for my little talents; and if I can but make your life ea&s;y and comfortable, I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, with tears in her eyes, embraced her daughter, bid her di&s;po&s;e of every thing as &s;he plea&s;ed, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would endeavour to bear her new condition of life with patience and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Sophia immediately wrote to a gentleman of the law, who had been an intimate friend of her fa|ther's&punc; and he undertook to manage their little af|fairs in town. A few days afterwards he brought them fifty pounds, which was all that remained from the &s;ale, after every demand upon Mrs. Darn|ley was paid.</P>
<P>She read over the accounts with great emo|tion, bitterly regretting every trinket &s;he had
<PB N="734" REF="340">
parted with, and told Sophia, that it was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould &s;ettle in &s;ome village near town, for &s;he could not bear the thoughts of ex|po&s;ing her poverty to her acquaintance, and of be|ing &s;een in a wor&s;e condition than formerly.</P>
<P>Sophia, who thought her declining health a bet|ter rea&s;on for not re&s;iding in London, hired in an adjacent village, at a very &s;mall rent, a little hou&s;e, or rather cottage, &s;o neat, and &s;ituated &s;o happily, that an imagination lively as hers was, and a little romantick, could not fail of being charmed with it. To this place &s;he removed her books, and being pro|vided by her friend Dolly, with an innocent coun|try girl for a &s;ervant, &s;he conducted her mother to her rural abode, and had the &s;atisfaction to find her plea&s;ed with it, novelty having always charms for her, and here for a few days, it &s;upplied the place of tho&s;e other gratifications to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e cares, Sophia did not forget her unhappy &s;i&s;ter: &s;he wrote &s;everal letters to her, in which &s;he employed all the power of virtuous eloquence to bring her to a &s;en&s;e of her errors, but in vain.</P>
<P>Harriot did not deign to an&s;wer her, but in a let|ter to her mother, &s;he complained of the injurious treatment &s;he received from Sophia, and earne&s;tly intreated her to leave her &s;i&s;ter, and re&s;ide with her.</P>
<P>Although Mrs. Darnley refu&s;ed this offer with &s;eeming &s;teadine&s;s, yet her di&s;content was but too apparent. A life of retirement, which often obliged
<PB N="735" REF="341">
her to &s;eek in her&s;elf, tho&s;e re&s;ources again&s;t lan|guor and melancholy, which &s;he u&s;ed to find in the di&s;&s;ipations of the town, could not be grateful to one who had never accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to reflection, who&s;e mind was filled with trifles, and its whole &s;tock of ideas derived from dre&s;s, cards, and every other fa&s;hionable folly.</P>
<P>To be capable of enjoying a rural life, there is &s;omething more nece&s;&s;ary than a good under&s;tand|in: innocence and purity of manners mu&s;t contri|bute to give a reli&s;h to plea&s;ures, which are found|ed in rea&s;on, virtue, and piety.</P>
<P>Hence it was, that Sophia, in the bloom of youth, found happine&s;s in the &s;olitude of a village, while her mother, in a declining age, panted after the va|nities of the town.</P>
<P>In vain, did Mr. Herbert fill the letters he wrote to Mrs. Darnley, with maxims of morality and pious admonitions; he experienced here the truth of that ob&s;ervation, that it is a work of great dif|ficulty, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s vice from a heart, where long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eems to plead pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>Sophia, who knew her mother's ta&s;te for living at ea&s;e, that &s;he might be able to gratify it, applied her&s;elf diligently to her work, which was a piece of embroidery, that had been be&s;poke by a bene|volent lady, in order to give her pre&s;ent employ|men; and, by exhibiting it as a proof of her inge|nuity, to procure her more. She likewi&s;e exerci&s;ed her invention in drawing little de&s;igns for fan|mounts; and always cho&s;e &s;uch &s;ubjects as convey|ed &s;ome moral le&s;&s;on to the mind, while they plea|&s;ed the imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="736" REF="342">Some of the&s;e drawings were di&s;po&s;ed of, by the lady her friend, &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that Sophia was encouraged to pur&s;ue her labour; and Mrs. Darn|ley, flattered by the pro&s;pect of more ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, began to enlarge her &s;cheme of expence, made little excur&s;ions about the country in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, talked of hiring a better hou&s;e, and of pa&s;&s;ing two months at lea&s;t in London during the winter.</P>
<P>Mean time Harriot became more earne&s;t in her &s;olicitations to her mother, to come and live with her; her &s;ituation began to be &s;o generally &s;u&s;pec|ted, that &s;he was in danger of being wholly ne|glected.</P>
<P>She wrote to her in a &s;train of tenderne&s;s and duty, that revived all the ill-judging parent's af|fection, who invited her to make her a vi&s;it in her little retreat, and promi&s;ed her a favourable recep|tion even from Sophia her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sophia was indeed far from oppo&s;ing this vi&s;it; &s;he was rather de&s;irous of drawing her &s;i&s;ter thither frequently, with a hope that her example and her arguments, might one day influence her to change her conduct.</P>
<P>Harriot received this invitation with joy; for &s;uch was the depravity of her mind, that &s;he exult|ed in having an opportunity of di&s;playing the gran|duer of her dre&s;s, and equipage to her &s;i&s;ter; to her who had made virtuous poverty her choice, and &s;hewn that &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed riches, when they were to be purcha&s;ed by guilt. <HI>The pride of human nature</HI> (&s;ays an eminent writer) <HI>takes its ri&s;e from its cor|ruption, as worms are produced by putrefaction.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="737" REF="343">The wretched fallen Harriot was proud! the dia|monds that glittered in her hair, the gilt chariot, and the luxurious table; the&s;e monuments of her di&s;grace contributed to keep up the in&s;olence of a woman, who by the lo&s;s of her honour was lower than the meane&s;t of her &s;ervants, who could boa&s;t of an uncorrupted virtue.</P>
<P>Sophia was bu&s;ily employed upon her embroi|dery, when Harriot, from her gay chariot, alight|ed at her door; &s;he entered that humble abode of innocence and indu&s;try, in a kind of triumph, and acco&s;ted her &s;i&s;ter with a haughty expre&s;&s;ion of &s;u|periority in her looks and air, as if &s;he expected the &s;plendor of her appearance &s;hould &s;trike her with awe.</P>
<P>Sophia received her with the mode&s;t dignity of con&s;cious virtue; and Harriot, tho' incapable of much reflection, yet &s;oon perceived the mi&s;erable figure &s;he made, in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a cha|racter, and &s;tood &s;ilent and aba&s;hed, while Sophia contemplated her finery with an eye of pity and of angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Harriot, at length recovering her&s;elf, a&s;ked for her mother, who that moment entered the room. The &s;ight of her daughter's equipage, had thrown her into an agreeable flutter of &s;pirits, and &s;he rea|dily pardoned the fine lady, all the faults of the un|grateful child.</P>
<P>Harriot emboldened by &s;o kind a reception, pro|po&s;ed to her to accompany her to town, promi&s;ing to make her abode with her agreeable, by every in&s;tance of duty and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="738" REF="344">Mrs. Darnley blu&s;hed, and was &s;ilent. Sophia fixed her eyes upon her mother, anxious and impa|tient for her an&s;wer; &s;he ca&s;t a timed glance at Sophia: &s;he read in her &s;peaking eyes her &s;enti|ments of this propo&s;al; and turning to Harriot, &s;he told her faintly, that not being &s;atisfied with her conduct, it would be very improper for her to countenance it, by re&s;iding with her.</P>
<P>Harriot bur&s;t into tears, and exclaimed again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter's malice, who, &s;he &s;aid, acted like her mo&s;t cruel enemy, and &s;ought to ruin her charac|ter, by e&s;tranging her&s;elf from her company, and preventing her mother from taking notice of her.</P>
<P>Sophia, with great gentlene&s;s, proved to her, that the lo&s;s of her reputation, was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of her living in a manner un&s;uitable to her circum&s;tances; that her mother and her, by complying with her reque&s;t, could not pre&s;erve her from cen&s;ure, but would incur it them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><Q>You call me cruel, Harriot, &s;aid &s;he, for e&s;tranging my&s;elf from your company; but con&s;ider a little, whether it is not you that are both cruel and unju&s;t. Why would you deprive me of the only reward the world be&s;tows on me, for a life of voluntary poverty; you have exchanged a good name for dre&s;s and equipage; and I, to pre&s;erve one, &s;ubject my&s;elf to labour and indigence: you enjoy your purcha&s;e; but I &s;hould lo&s;e mine, were I to have that complai|&s;ance for you which you require. Leave me
<PB N="739" REF="345">
my reputation then, &s;ince it is the &s;ole recom|pence of tho&s;e hard&s;hips to which I willingly &s;ubmit; and if you wi&s;h to recover yours, be contented to be poor like me.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, finding her &s;i&s;ter li&s;tened to her, tho' it was &s;ullenly, and with down ca&s;t eyes, expatiated in a tender manner upon the errors of her con|duct, and the fatal con&s;equences that were likely to follow.</P>
<P>Harriot at length interrupted her, with a pert air, and &s;aid,
<Q>She would not be taught her duty by her younger &s;i&s;ter;</Q>
then turning to her mo|ther,
<Q>I hope madam, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;i&s;ter will not have &s;o much power with you, as to make you forbid my coming here.</Q></P>
<P>She put her handkerchief to her eyes, as &s;he &s;aid this; to which Mrs. Darnley replied, with great vehemence,
<Q>That no per&s;on on earth &s;hould ever prevail upon her to ca&s;t off her child.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia was &s;ilent, and ob&s;erving that her pre|&s;ence &s;eemed to lay them under &s;ome re&s;traint, &s;he ro&s;e up, to retire to her work, telling her &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by her,
<Q>That far from hindering her vi&s;its, &s;he would rather encourage her to repeat them often, that &s;he might be convinced it was po&s;&s;ible, to be happy in a cottage.</Q></P>
<P>Harriot laughed, and muttered the words ro|mantick and affectation, which Sophia took no no|tice of, but left her at liberty to conver&s;e freely with her mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley talked to her at fir&s;t in a chiding &s;train, and affected to a&s;&s;ume the authority of a parent; but, a &s;lave to her appetites, &s;he could not
<PB N="740" REF="346">
re&s;i&s;t any opportunity of gratifying them; and Harriot found it no difficult matter to force a pre&s;ent upon her, to &s;upply tho&s;e expences which her extravagance, and not her wants, made nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Harriot now came often to the village, and gave it out, that &s;he was upon the be&s;t terms ima|ginable with her mother and &s;i&s;ter, not doubt|ing but the world would cea&s;e to &s;u&s;pect her, &s;ince Sophia approved her conduct.</P>
<P>The frequency and the length of her vi&s;its made Sophia entertain hopes of her reformation, &s;ince the time &s;he &s;pent with her mother, was taken from that dangerous and immoral di&s;&s;ipation, which forms the circle of what is called a gay life. For it is with our manners as with our health; the abatement of vice is a degree of virtue, the abate|ment of di&s;ea&s;e is a degree of health.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert being perfectly recovered, filled Sophia with extreme joy, by the account he &s;ent her of it, and of his re&s;olutlon to come and live near her.</P>
<P>While &s;he impatiently expected his arrival, and &s;ent many a longing look towards the road, near which her little cottage was &s;ituated, &s;he one day &s;aw a gentleman ride by full &s;peed, who in his per&s;on and air had a great re&s;emblance to Sir Charles Stanley. Her heart, by its throbbing emo|tion, &s;eemed to acknowledge its conqueror; for poor Sophia was &s;till in love: &s;he loved, though &s;he de&s;paired of ever being happy; and by thus per|&s;i&s;ting in a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, contradicted that maxim, that love like fire, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without
<PB N="741" REF="347">
continual motion, and cea&s;es to be as &s;oon as it cea&s;es to hope or fear.</P>
<P>Sophia, not able to remove her eyes from the place where &s;he fancied &s;he had &s;een Sir Charles, continued to look fixedly towards the road, and was beginning to believe &s;he had been mi&s;taken, when a &s;ervant in Sir Charles's livery rode by al&s;o, and put it out of doubt that &s;he had really &s;een the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This unexpected incident awakened a thou&s;and tender melancholy ideas in her mind; and finding her&s;elf too much &s;oftened, &s;he had recour&s;e again to her work, to divert her imagination from an object, &s;he had vainly endeavoured to forget.</P>

<HEAD>The following Life of VANDYCK is publi&s;hed from a Manu&s;cript, communicated to the Author of the LADY's MUSEUM by a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Sir ANTHONY VANDYCK.</HEAD>
<P>ANthony Vandyck was born in the city of Antwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, in the year 1599; his father was a merchant of linen cloth; his mother employed her|&s;elf in embroidery, which requiring &s;ome &s;mall knowledge in de&s;ign, &s;he taught her &s;on in the be&s;t manner &s;he could the fir&s;t rudiments of drawing, in which he made &s;o quick progre&s;s, that he &s;oon became capable of giving in&s;tructions to his former tutor: his mother conceived &s;o great hopes of his future advancement in the arts, that &s;he per&s;uaded his father to place him with Ru|bens, who was the mo&s;t celebrated painter of that time. Vandyck &s;oon became a favourite of his ma&s;ter's, not only for his good behaviour and ingenious di&s;po&s;ition, but from the real advantage he was likely to find in having a &s;cholar that would &s;o &s;oon be capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting. him. The fir&s;t thing Rubens &s;et him about was to make a draw|ing after his picture of the battle of the Amazons,
<PB N="749" REF="355">
in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that, from that very drawing, the print which is &s;o much admired was engraved: after this Rubens thought it time to in&s;truct him in the art of colouring, that he might likewi&s;e be of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him in painting. He fir&s;t employed him in copying his works, in which he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well, that his ma&s;ter after giving a few touches, &s;old them as his own performance. He &s;oon after made &s;o great pro|gre&s;s that he executed great works in colours from his ma&s;ter's de&s;igns, and afterwards from his own invention, particularly the hi&s;tory of Achilles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e pictures were in Dr. Mead's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;old at his &s;ale.</NOTE>, which was intended for a &s;uit of tape&s;try. It is re|ported that Rubens got no le&s;s then ten pounds a day by the labours of his ingenious di&s;ciple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This was a very con&s;iderable &s;um in tho&s;e days.</NOTE>. Ru|bens began now to be not a little alarmed at the extraordinary talents he di&s;covered in his di&s;ciple; and with good rea&s;on, fearing he might rival his renown, advi&s;ed him (after be&s;towing great com|mendations on &s;ome portraits Vandyck had ju&s;t fini&s;hed) to apply him&s;elf entirely to the &s;tudy of por|trait-painting; and at the &s;ame time continually re|commending to Vandyck tho&s;e who applyed for their portraits to him&s;elf, he in a great mea&s;ure &s;tifled that true &s;pirit and genius of painting which ought to have been exerted in the invention and compo&s;i|tion of hi&s;tory. Thus Titian (but a little more barbarou&s;ly) bani&s;hed Tintoret from his hou&s;e; a
<PB N="750" REF="356">
practice often u&s;ed by the great ma&s;ters, but as un&s;ucce&s;sful as malicious. For &s;trength of genius, like a &s;park of fire, will at la&s;t blaze up, and perhaps with greater force from its meeting with oppo&s;ition. The fir&s;t picture Vandyck painted after he had withdrawn from the &s;chool of his ma&s;ter, was for the church of Dominick: the &s;ubject was that of our Saviour bearing the cro&s;s on his knees, accompanied by the two Marys, with &s;oldiers conducting him to Mount Calvary: this work is much in the &s;tyle of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He now began to think it time to vi&s;it Italy, and accordingly &s;et out for Venice, where he applied him&s;elf wholly to the &s;tudy of the Venetian art of colouring, particularly the works of Titian and Paul Verone&s;e, the &s;ame fountains that had before &s;o liberally &s;upplied his ma&s;ter. He copied many hi&s;torical pictures for his improvement, and paint|ed portraits for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but the former pro|ducing no money, and the latter not &s;ufficient for his expences, he thought fit to remove to Geneva, where he found the greate&s;t encouragement for his talent of portrait-painting. Notwith&s;tanding which, being determined to vi&s;it Rome, he undertook that journey, and at his arrival there is entertained in the court of cardinal Bentivoglio, a great favourer of the Flemi&s;h nation, having him&s;elf lived there a con|&s;iderable time, and writ the hi&s;tory of that country. In return for the civility he received, he drew his patron's picture, whole length, which is now in the Palazzo Piti at Florence, and e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t of Vandyck's works: he drew al&s;o, for the &s;ame cardinal, Chri&s;t dying on the cro&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="751" REF="357">Sir Robert Shirly arriving at Rome about this time, with the character of amba&s;&s;ador from Abba, king of Per&s;ia, to Gregory XV. Vandyck drew his picture and his wife's, both in the Per&s;ian habit, which bizar kind of dre&s;s gave a new lu&s;tre to the u&s;ual graces of his painting.</P>
<P>There was many of Vandyck's countrymen at that time &s;tudying at Rome; and it was a cu&s;tom among&s;t them, that a new-comer &s;hould always invite his countrymen and brother &s;tudents to a &s;upper, where in the mid&s;t of their mirth they u&s;ed to give him a nick-name, by which he was ever after to be known. This kind of revel Van|dyck refu&s;ed, which they took &s;o ill at his hands, that &s;ince he would not &s;ubmit to receive any other name, they were re&s;olved to give him that of Ambitious, and they took all occa&s;ions to condemn in him his pride and his art together.</P>
<P>In reality, Vandyck had a certain &s;tateline&s;s and gravity in his air, which might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for pride: his manner of behaviour, the richne&s;s of his habits, with the number of his &s;ervants, &s;eemed all too high for his employment. This fault (if it is one) is very pardonable, having been u&s;ed to &s;uch magnificence, in the &s;chool of his ma&s;ter Rubens, whil&s;t he was there, conver&s;ing mo&s;tly with noblemen, and people of the higher fa&s;hion; and being him&s;elf of a temper &s;omewhat elevated, he was naturally led to model him&s;elf on their behaviour.</P>
<P>The true rea&s;on of Vandyck's journey to Rome, appears to be, not &s;o much to &s;tudy, as to &s;hew

his excellence in his art; but meeting with too much hatred and ill-will from his countrymen, and not &s;o much encouragement from others as he expected, he left Rome, and returned to Genoa, which he u&s;ed to call his home, and there his reputation and profit were very con&s;ide|rable. He drew mo&s;t of the noblemen and &s;enators of the place, particularly the family of the Raggi.</P>

<HEAD>THE TALE of GENEURA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Italian of LODOVICO ARIOSTO, in the Fifth Book of his ORLANDO FURIOSO.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble Rinaldo &s;ailing to England, whither he was &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y by the emperor Charlemagne, a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, which continuing two days and nights, drove him, at la&s;t, on the coa&s;t of Scotland: His fleet arriv|ing &s;afe, he ordered his retinue to meet him at Ber|wick, he him&s;elf, without any attendants, &s;truck into the famous fore&s;t of Caledonia, not without a hope of meeting with &s;ome adventure worthy his courage and virtue.</P>
<P>While he was plea&s;ing him&s;elf with this expecta|tion, &s;ometimes riding, and &s;ometimes walking a &s;low pace leading his hor&s;e, night drew on, and he now began to think it nece&s;&s;ary to go in que&s;t of a lodging. Perceiving an abbey at &s;ome di&s;tance, he remounted his hor&s;e and rode up to it. The abbot and his monks, &s;eeing a &s;tranger of a noble appearance at their gate, came out, and with great civility invited him to pa&s;s the night there.</P>
<P>Rinaldo gratefully accepted their offer; and be|ing conducted to a chamber, and an elegant repa&s;t &s;erved to the table, as &s;oon as he had &s;atisfied the
<PB N="754" REF="360">
cravings of an appetite made eager by travel and long fa&s;ting, he enquired of the good fathers what noble exploits in arms had been lately performed in their neighbourhood, and whether a warrior might hope to find any occa&s;ions there of &s;ignaliz|ing his valour?</P>
<P>'Tis certain, replied the abbot, that many great and wonderful adventures have been atchieved in this fore&s;t, but as the place, &s;o are the actions ob|&s;cure, and buried in oblivion: however, if honour be your pur&s;uit, the pre&s;ent time affords you a fit opportunity to acquire it; the danger, indeed, is great, but if you &s;ucceed, eternal fame will be your reward. The young and beautiful Geneura, the daughter of our king, is accu&s;ed by a knight named Lurcanio, of having violated her cha&s;tity; and it is provided by our Scotti&s;h laws, that all dam|&s;els, of what rank &s;oever, who are publickly charg|ed with incontinence, &s;hall &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of fire, unle&s;s a champion be found who will un|dertake their defence, and fight with the accu&s;er.</P>
<P>Geneura, in con&s;equence of this law, has been adjudged to die, and only a month's &s;pace allowed her to procure a defender of her life and honour. The king, anxious for his daughter's &s;afety, but more for her reputation, has cau&s;ed it to be pro|claimed throughout his dominions, that by what|ever per&s;on (provided his birth be not ab&s;olutely ba&s;e) his daughter &s;hall be delivered from the danger that threatens her, to him he will give the prince&s;s in marriage, with a portion &s;uitable to her high rank and quality.</P>
<P><PB N="755" REF="361">This enterprize, noble &s;tranger, is worthy your youth, your courage, and genero&s;ity: the law of arms requires all true knights to undertake the de|fence of injured and oppre&s;&s;ed ladies; and, &s;urely, a fairer than Geneura is not to be found from one extremity of the globe to the other; nor, if com|mon opinion may be relied on, a cha&s;ter.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid Rinaldo after a little pau&s;e, that this fair prince&s;s is condemned to die for hav|ing generou&s;ly rewarded the pa&s;&s;ion of a faithful lover? Cur&s;ed be the makers of &s;o hard a law: more cur&s;ed they that are influenced by it. For me it matters not whether Geneura be ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly accu&s;ed; what has been imputed to her as a crime, were I her judge, &s;he &s;hould be applaud|ed for, had &s;he taken care to have avoided di&s;co|very; but, as it is, I am re&s;olved to defy her accu|&s;er to combat, and I tru&s;t &s;hall be able to deliver her from the unju&s;t and cruel puni&s;hment &s;he has been doomed to.</P>
<P>The abbot and monks, overjoyed that they had procured a champion for their prince&s;s, be&s;towed a thou&s;and prai&s;es on Rinaldo for his generous de|&s;ign; and he, full of impatience to begin the glo|rious enterprize, being furni&s;hed by his ho&s;ts with a guide, &s;et out early the next morning for the Scotti&s;h court, leaving the good fathers charmed with his courage and gallantry, and offering up re|peated prayers to heaven for his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As they were pur&s;uing their journey through bye-roads, for the greater expedition, a cry, as of &s;ome per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, rouzed all their attention. In&s;tantly Rinaldo clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and
<PB N="756" REF="362">
galloping towards the place from whence the noi&s;e proceeded, he came to a deep valley, &s;ur|rounded with trees, through the branches of which he perceived a young maid &s;truggling to free her|&s;elf from the hands of two ru&s;&s;ians, who were at|tempting to murder her. Tran&s;ported with rage at this &s;ight, the generous Rinaldo flew to the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;el; his appearance &s;o ter|rified the intended murderers, that they left their prey, and fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>Mean time the maid recovered from her fright, thanked her deliverer with a tran&s;port of joy and gratitude, and was beginning to acquaint him with the &s;tory of her misfortunes, when he, who had not alighted, being eager to pur&s;ue his journey, commanded his guide to take her up behind him; and as they travelled, having at lei&s;ure ob&s;erved her countenance and behaviour, he was &s;o much &s;truck with the beauty of the one, and the &s;oft and gentle mode&s;ty of the other, that his curio&s;ity was awakened, and he became &s;olicitous to know by what means &s;he had been brought into &s;o cruel a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>His reque&s;t being inforced with kind a&s;&s;urances of future protection, the dam&s;el, with a low voice, and eyes ca&s;t down in a graceful confu&s;ion, began in this manner:</P>
<P>Since you, my generous deliverer, have com|manded me to relate my misfortunes, prepare to hear a tale more full of horror, an act of greater villainy and ba&s;ene&s;s than Athens, Thebes, or Ar|gos ever knew. Ah! 'tis no wonder that our bar|ren clime is cur&s;t with a long winter's cea&s;ele&s;s rage, Phoebus di&s;dains to &s;hine upon a land where
<PB N="757" REF="363">
&s;uch inhuman crimes are perpetrated; deeds black as darkne&s;s, and fit to be covered with everla&s;ting night; unhappy as I am, I bore but too great a &s;hare in tho&s;e I am going to relate.</P>
<P>From my earlie&s;t youth I was brought up in the palace with the daughter of our king, honoured with a near attendance on her per&s;on, and hap|py in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her affection and e&s;teem. Long might I have enjoyed this delightful &s;itua|tion; but love (ah! that ever &s;o &s;weet a pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould prove the &s;ource of &s;o much mi&s;ery) love interrupted my tranquility, &s;ubjected my whole &s;oul, and gave me up to guilt, to &s;hame, and una|vailing penitence.</P>
<P>The duke of Alban was the object of my vir|gin wi&s;hes, my youth and per&s;on plea&s;ed him; &s;killed as he was in every deluding art by which the fal&s;e and the de&s;igning part of his &s;ex betray the unexperienced of ours, is it any wonder that I was deceived? Fond of believing what I wi&s;hed, and judging of his pa&s;&s;ion by my own, I yielded to his de&s;ires, and vainly hoped this &s;acrifice of my ho|nour would &s;ecure to me for ever the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart.</P>
<P>Our guilty commerce la&s;ted &s;ome months, dur|ing which time I always received his vi&s;its in a &s;um|mer apartment belonging to the prince&s;s my mi&s;|tre&s;s, into which, as it was now the mo&s;t rigid &s;ea|&s;on of the year, &s;he never entered; and being al&s;o in a part of the palace little frequented, and the windows oppo&s;ite to &s;ome ruined hou&s;es, my lover could come thither unob&s;erved, and by the help of
<PB N="758" REF="364">
a &s;ilken cord which I let down to him, ea&s;ily a&s;cend the chamber.</P>
<P>All &s;en&s;e of virtue being now &s;ubdued, and my whole &s;oul &s;unk in a dear lethargick dream of plea|&s;ure, I never once &s;u&s;pected that as my pa&s;&s;ion in|crea&s;ed, that of my lover was decrea&s;ing. Ah! my too violent love favoured his deceit, or &s;oon I might have perceived that he feigned much, and loved but little.</P>
<P>At length, notwith&s;tanding my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, his coldne&s;s became vi&s;ible; I &s;igh'd, I wept, I re|proach'd; alas! how unavailing are all endeavours to revive a decaying pa&s;&s;ion, &s;atiated by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and con&s;tant only to incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Polyne&s;&s;o, &s;o was my faithle&s;s lover named, lan|gui&s;hed in &s;ecret for the bright Geneura, my royal mi&s;tre&s;s; I know not if this pa&s;&s;ion commenced be|fore my ruin was completed, or whether her more powerful charms was the cau&s;e of his infidelity; but certain it is, that relying on the fervent love I bore him, he made no &s;cruple to confe&s;s his flame even to me, urging me by all the arguments his wicked mind could &s;ugge&s;t, to move the heart of Geneura in his favour.</P>
<P>Ah my lord! judge if this cruel man was dear to me, ever &s;olicitous to procure his happine&s;s, and &s;oothed by his a&s;&s;urances that ambition was the pre|vailing motive of his addre&s;s to the prince&s;s, in which, if he &s;ucceeded, he vowed to keep me &s;till his, and that I &s;hould &s;hare with her his per&s;on and his heart, I con&s;ented to all he propo&s;ed; and fol|lowing his in&s;tructions, took all opportunities of prai&s;ing him to my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="759" REF="365">The duke of Alban was the con&s;tant &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e; I extolled his valour, his genero&s;ity, his illu&s;trious birth, the manly graces of his per&s;on, the mingled &s;weetne&s;s and dignity of his manners; the charming theme tran&s;ported me out of my&s;elf. With eager plea&s;ure I ran over all his virtues, dwelt with delight on every imputed charm; &s;carce could my tongue keep pace with the overflowings of my love-&s;ick fancy, fond of the dear indulgence of talking in a per&s;onated character of him I loved.</P>
<P>But when, in compliance with his injunctions, I ventured to in&s;inuate his pa&s;&s;ion for her, then only did I &s;peak with coldne&s;s and re&s;traint; &s;lowly the unwilling words found way, checked by my ri&s;ing &s;ighs, and prefaced by my blu&s;hes. My emotions could not have been hid from an intere&s;ted ob&s;er|vation; but the prince&s;s was not only wholly indif|ferent to Polyne&s;&s;o, but indulged a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ion for the all-accompli&s;hed Ariodant.</P>
<P>This young knight, an Italian by birth, came with his brother to the court of Scotland, either in pur&s;uit of glory, or to tran&s;act &s;ome &s;ecret bu&s;ine&s;s with the king. To the graces of his form, than which nature never made one more lovely, is added a mind fraught with whatever is mo&s;t great and excellent in mankind; his valour never yet found an equal in our land; his is the prize at every tournement, his the foremo&s;t honours of the field: in peace the ornament of our court, in war the de|fender of our country.</P>
<P>The king, to whom he had indeared him&s;elf by a thou&s;and &s;ervices, loaded him with riches and honours, and gave him the fir&s;t employments in
<PB N="760" REF="366">
the kingdom; the hill of Sicily burns not with fiercer fires, nor glows Ve&s;uvius with more ardent flames, than tho&s;e which the bright eyes of our prince&s;s kindled in the heart of Ariodant.</P>
<P>I &s;oon di&s;covered that Geneura approved, en|couraged and returned his pa&s;&s;ion; and being, as you may ea&s;ily imagine, not greatly concerned at this ob&s;tacle to the de&s;ires of my faithle&s;s duke, I acquainted him with all I knew, and from the ap|parent impo&s;&s;ibility of his ever &s;ucceeding in his attempt, drew arguments to induce him to give it over.</P>
<P>Polyne&s;&s;o, naturally haughty and vindictive, could not bear with patience, the thoughts of be|ing rejected for a &s;tranger, every way, as he conceived, his inferior; di&s;dain, &s;hame, rage, by turns, engro&s;&s;ed his &s;oul, and bani&s;hed thence every &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ion; his love for Geneura was now converted to the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate hatred, and he re|&s;olved to accompli&s;h her ruin by the blacke&s;t trea|&s;on that ever was conceived in the heart of man.</P>
<P>His &s;cheme of revenge concerted, in which I, alas! tho' ignorantly, was to act the chief part, he one day acco&s;ted me with an air more tender and affectionate than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>My dear&punc; Dalinda, &s;aid he, generous and kind as you have been to me, well may you think your|&s;elf injured by my incon&s;tancy, but as trees, you know, when cropt by the pruner's hand, &s;hoot out into fre&s;h luxuriant branches, &s;o on the root of my pa&s;&s;ion for Geneura, young buds of fondne&s;s ri&s;e, and all the ripening fruit is yours.</P>
<P><PB N="761" REF="367">Nor do I langui&s;h &s;o much for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Geneura's beauties, as I di&s;dain to be thus rejected and contemned; and, le&s;t this grief &s;hould prey too forcibly on my heart, do thou, my fair, indulge my &s;ick fancy with a kind deceit, and in the dre&s;s of that too haughty charmer, receive me to thy arms.</P>
<P>When the prince&s;s is retired to bed, put on her robes, adorn thee with her riche&s;t jewels, with her girdle bind thy &s;welling bo&s;om, let her coronet glitter on thy beauteous brow, and beneath it let thy hair de&s;cend in graceful curls like hers; then, in her borrowed form, attend my coming at the well-known window; thus &s;hall my pride be gra|tified, and my capricious fancy plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Without reflecting on the in&s;idious purport of this reque&s;t, I promi&s;ed to comply with it; and, for many &s;uccee&s;&s;ive nights, received him in the habit he pre&s;cribed. Having thus wrought me to his wi&s;h, his wicked arts were next played off on Ariodant.</P>
<P>Before the duke had any knowledge of his pa&s;|&s;ion for the prince&s;s, he had lived in &s;trict friend|&s;hip with this young knight, and thence took oc|ca&s;ion to reproach him with the breach of it, by pre&s;uming to addre&s;s the prince&s;s.</P>
<P>In you, &s;aid he, I little expected a rival as well on account of your attachment to me, as the im|probability of your &s;ucceeding in your attempt; for you are not now to be told of the mutual pa&s;|&s;ion that has long joined Geneura's heart and mine, nor that I intend &s;oon to ask the king's con&s;ent to e&s;pou&s;e her; why then do you fondly thru&s;t your|&s;elf
<PB N="762" REF="368">
between me and my almo&s;t certain happine&s;s? how differently &s;hould I act were I in your place?</P>
<P>Why this to me, my lord? replied Ariodant ha&s;tily; 'tis you who have betrayed our friend&s;hip, you have commenced my rival, not I yours. I claim a prior right in fair Geneura, as having loved her fir&s;t, and have been happy enough to in&s;pire her with an equal flame; this you might have per|ceived, had you not been blinded by ob&s;tinacy; &s;ince then the laws of friend&s;hip demand one of us to yield, be yours the task, as having le&s;s right to per&s;i&s;t, and le&s;s hope of &s;ucceeding than my&s;elf. In riches indeed you are my &s;uperior; but the king's favour is equally &s;hared betwixt us, and in the heart of Geneura the advantage is wholly mine.</P>
<P>What errors does not love occa&s;ion? replied the duke; each thinks him&s;elf the happy object of her wi&s;hes, and yet 'tis certain that only one is loved: thus then let us decide the conte&s;t; he who can give the mo&s;t certain proofs of her affection &s;hall be left by the other in the free and undi&s;turbed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: but fir&s;t, let us bind our&s;elves by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths not to di&s;clo&s;e each others &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>To this Ariodant, with trembling impatience agreed, and the artful duke went on in this man|ner:</P>
<P>'Tis now almo&s;t five months &s;ince the beaute|ous Geneura rewarded my ardent love with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on; oft has the con&s;cious queen of night lent me her &s;hades to guide me to my charmer, and &s;een me happy in her arms.</P>
<P><PB N="763" REF="369">'Tis fal&s;e, by Heaven, interrupted Ariodant, tran&s;|ported with rage; not that cold queen, who&s;e name thou ha&s;t profaned, is cha&s;ter than my Ge|neura. Traitor, with my good &s;word I'll prove thou lye&s;t; take notice I defy thee to mortal com|bat, and will with thy deare&s;t blood, wa&s;h away the &s;landers thou ha&s;t thrown upon my prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Moderate your rage, &s;aid the calm villain, I mean to give you proofs, convincing proofs, of what I have &s;aid; your own eyes &s;hall be witne&s;&s;es of the favours I enjoy.</P>
<P>The unhappy Ariodant, pale, trembling, and lo&s;t in &s;peechle&s;s grief and horror at tho&s;e fatal words, &s;tood for &s;ome moments fixed in racking thought, like the &s;ad &s;tatue of de&s;pair; then rai&s;|ing his eyes, overflowing with tears, to heaven, and pa&s;&s;ionately &s;triking his groaning brea&s;t, And can it be, he cried, that my Geneura, that prin|ce&s;s whom I loved, whom I adored with &s;uch pure reverence as mortals pay to Deities, &s;hould become the prey of loo&s;e de&s;ires, and give her faithful Ari|odant to death? Oh! 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, though a God &s;poke it, I &s;hould &s;ay 'twere fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Incredulous man, &s;aid Polyne&s;&s;o, have I not of|fered to give thee proofs that cannot be denied? Thy eyes &s;hall &s;ee the favours &s;he be&s;tows on me.</P>
<P>I take you at your word, re&s;umed Ariodant im|patiently, give me to behold her guilt and I am &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>To-morrow night, &s;aid the duke, I have an ap|pointment with her; I will conduct you to a place from whence, unperceived, you your&s;elf &s;hall be|hold me a&s;cend her chamber window, and judge
<PB N="764" REF="370">
by the reception &s;he gives me, if I am happy in her favour.</P>
<P>To this the almo&s;t di&s;tracted Ariodant con&s;ented; and, at the appointed time, followed the duke to tho&s;e ruined hou&s;es I mentioned before, and there &s;tood concealed from view: being doubtful of Po|lyne&s;&s;o's intentions, he had ordered his brother Lurcanio to arm and go with him, directing him to &s;tay at a convenient di&s;tance, &s;o as to be within call if any treachery was offered him, but not in &s;ight of Geneura's window; for he would have no witne&s;s of her guilt but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The duke, having placed Ariodant mo&s;t con|veniently for his purpo&s;e, advanced and gave the u&s;ual &s;ign; unhappy as I am I heard, and eagerly obeyed the welcome &s;ummons; adorned in Ge|neura's riche&s;t robes, and covered with the veil that prince&s;&s;es only wear, I appeared at the win|dow and threw the &s;ilken ladder over to my lover.</P>
<P>Lurcanio, either fearing for his brother's &s;afety, or de&s;irous of prying into his &s;ecrets, quitted his appointed &s;tation, and unperceived by him, walked &s;oftly forward till he came within ten paces of Ariodant; and now my faithle&s;s duke was &s;een by both the brothers, (though known only to Ariodant) to a&s;cend the ladder and gain the chamber window, at which I met him with a tender embrace, wandering over his lips and eyes with eager ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This &s;ight &s;o enflamed the &s;oul of Ariodant with rage and grief, that drawing out his &s;word, and fixing the pummel of it in the ground, he was going to ru&s;h with all his force upon the point, had
<PB N="765" REF="371">
he not been prevented by Lurcanio, who perceiving his ra&s;h de&s;ign, &s;prang to him in an in&s;tant, and having thrown a&s;ide the fatal in&s;trument of death, received his &s;inking brother in his arms.</P>
<P>Ah mi&s;erable brother! &s;aid Lurcanio, by what wild fury art thou po&s;&s;e&s;t, to fall thus meanly for a woman? Now cur&s;ed, for ever cur&s;ed be all the kind; may they all peri&s;h in one wide ruin, blown as they are, like clouds, with every bla&s;t of wind: and this fair mi&s;chief that has betrayed thee, let us devi&s;e &s;ome glorious vengeance for her: let not thy noble life be &s;acrificed to her fal&s;hood; her's is the crime, be her's the puni&s;hment; proclaim her guilt aloud, accu&s;e her to the king; my eyes as well as thine have &s;een her infamy, and with my &s;word I'll make good thy a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Ariodant, who&s;e &s;oul was torn with various and conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, &s;miled gloomily at the men|tion of revenge; a-while he &s;eemed to bury every thought of grief and of de&s;pair in that one hope of &s;acrificing the guilty prince&s;s to his wrongs; but alas! the curele&s;s wound remained behind; Ge|neura, ba&s;e as &s;he appeared, he loved with &s;uch uncea&s;ing fondne&s;s, that wholly unable to endure her lo&s;s, and dreading no hell like that within his bo&s;om, once more he re&s;olved to die.</P>
<P>To Lurcanio, however, he di&s;&s;embled his de&s;ign, and went home with him at his reque&s;t; but early the next morning he departed, leaving no traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what place he was gone.</P>
<P>Lurcanio dreading the fatal effects of his de&s;|pair, was pierced to his inmo&s;t &s;oul at the news of
<PB N="766" REF="372">
his flight: the king and the whole court took part in his affliction; no methods were left untried to di&s;cover where he was; me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent in &s;earch of him to the utmo&s;t extremities of the kingdom; but all returned without any &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At length a pea&s;ant came to court, and at his reque&s;t was introduced to the prince&s;s, who in|formed her, that as he was travelling to the city he met Ariodant; that this unhappy knight ob|liged him to follow him and be witne&s;s of a deed he was going to perform; that obeying his orders they journeyed on together till they came to a &s;teep rock that hung pendant over the &s;ea, fronting the Iri&s;h i&s;land.</P>
<P>Ariodant, &s;aid the pea&s;ant, a&s;cending this rock, commanded me to ob&s;erve well what he did, to give you an account of it, and tell you his la&s;t words; which were, that he had &s;een too much: then &s;pringing furiou&s;ly from the top of the rock, he precipitated him&s;elf into the &s;ea. Terrified at the dreadful &s;ight, I ha&s;tily turned back, and travel|led hither to bring you the fatal news.</P>
<P>Geneura, overwhelmed with grief and amaze|ment for the death of her lover, and the &s;trange me&s;&s;age he had &s;ent her, abandoned her&s;elf to the mo&s;t violent exce&s;&s;es of de&s;pair; &s;he beat her beauteous bo&s;om, tore her hair, and in the wild|ne&s;s of her woe, a thou&s;and times invoked the dear loved name of Ariodant; repeated the my|&s;terious words he uttered, and as often called on death to end her.</P>
<P>The news of his death, with the &s;ad manner of it, &s;pread grief and con&s;ternation through the whole
<PB N="767" REF="373">
city; even the remote&s;t parts of Scotland felt and lamented the lo&s;s of their valiant defender; the king and the whole court bewailed his lo&s;s with the &s;incere&s;t &s;orrow: but Lurcanio, &s;uperior in grief, as more nearly intere&s;ted in the dear de|cea&s;ed, mourned his unhappy brother with all the tenderne&s;s of fraternal love, and all the warmth of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Revolving in his mind the fatal adventure of the window, which had been the cau&s;e of his bro|ther's di&s;traction; the de&s;ire and hope of revenge afforded &s;ome relief to the poignancy of his woe; and ob&s;tinately bent to &s;acrifice the prince&s;s to the manes of his Ariodant, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore the king and council, and accu&s;ed her of in|continence, relating all that Ariodant and he had &s;een, and the fatal effects it had upon him: he then reminded the king of the Scotti&s;h laws again&s;t uncha&s;tity, and loudly demanded ju&s;tice on the prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Horror and amazement &s;eized the &s;oul of the unhappy father! Geneura, tho' dearer to him than life, tho' innocent in his opinion, he has not power to &s;creen from the danger that threatens her; the laws indeed permit the accu&s;ed to have a champion to fight in her defence; by whom, if the pro&s;e|cutor (who is obliged to maintain by force of arms the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion) is wor&s;ted, &s;he is de|clared guiltle&s;s of the crimes laid to her charge.</P>
<P>To this only remedy the king has recour&s;e, and cau&s;es it to be proclaimed throughout his domi|nions, that if any knight of noble birth will under|take the defence of his daughter, and by force of
<PB N="768" REF="374">
arms &s;hall vanqui&s;h her accu&s;er, on him he will be|&s;tow the prince&s;s, with a dower &s;uitable to her quality.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this proclamation no knight has yet offered him&s;elf for the enterprize, deter|red therefrom by the known valour of Lurcanio: the king, no le&s;s anxious for Geneura's reputation than her life, cau&s;ed all her maids to be brought to a trial, who with one voice declared they never were privy to any intrigue of their royal mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the&s;e proceedings, and dreading the con&s;equence of a further &s;crutiny, I urged the duke to take &s;ome mea&s;ures for our common &s;ecurity: he, with di&s;&s;embled kindne&s;s, prai&s;ed my &s;ecrecy and affection, and &s;ent two men to conduct me to a ca&s;tle of his at a great di&s;tance from the court.</P>
<P>Wholly relying on his faith, I put my&s;elf under the protection of tho&s;e two villains, whom the duke, de&s;irous of removing for ever the only per|&s;on who could di&s;cover his guilt, ordered when they came to a convenient place, to murder me: happily for me chance conducted you that way; you delivered me from my impending fate, and while it &s;hall plea&s;e heaven to pre&s;erve my unhappy life, it &s;hall be &s;pent in grateful acknowledgments to my protector.</P>
<P>This account of Geneura's innocence was ex|tremely welcome to Rinaldo; for though confiding in his own courage he was not without hopes of delivering her, guilty as &s;he appeared; yet the certainty he was going to fight in a ju&s;t cau&s;e, animated him with double fires, and gave him al|mo&s;t a confirmation of victory.</P>
<P><PB N="769" REF="375">Now clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, he rode on with &s;uch eager ha&s;te, that the noble town of St. Andrews &s;oon appeared in view. There the combat was to be performed; the guards had already &s;urrounded the li&s;ts, the challenger's trumpet had &s;ounded, and the unhappy king, pale, trembling, and full of eager anxiety, li&s;tened with a beating heart, and fear-check'd wi&s;hes for an accepting an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mean time Rinaldo, having left the frighted Dalinda at an inn, with repeated a&s;&s;urances of gaining her pardon, in ca&s;e he vanqui&s;hed the prin|ce&s;s's accu&s;er, advanced towards the city-gate: here he was met by a young page, who informed him that an unknown knight, clad all in &s;able ar|mour, was arrived; that he had demanded the combat with Lurcanio, and declared he would die, or free the prince&s;s from her ignominious &s;entence.</P>
<P>Rinaldo, impatient to unfold the my&s;tery, thun|dered at the city-gates, which being opened, he rode eagerly to the li&s;ts; there beholding the com|batants engaged, he forced his way through the pre&s;s, and crying aloud that they &s;hould cea&s;e the fight, demanded an in&s;tant audience of the king.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hals of the field thereupon parted the two champions, and Rinaldo was immediately con|ducted to the king; to whom he related the whole &s;tory of Polyne&s;&s;o's treachery, as he had received it from Dalinda; adding that he would prove the truth of it by force of arms, and begged that he might be allowed to defy the traitor duke to &s;ingle combat.</P>
<P>The noble form of Rinaldo, but chiefly the plea&s;ing purport of his &s;peech, gained him ab&s;o|lute
<PB N="770" REF="376">
credit with the king. Scarce could the rap|tured parent re&s;train the wild exultings of his joy of this confirmation of his Geneura's innocence; dearer than life or empire was &s;he loved by him, and freely would he have &s;acrificed both to &s;ave her honour: he he&s;itated therefore not a moment in permitting the reque&s;ted combat, but ordered duke Polyne&s;&s;o to be called.</P>
<P>He, by his office of high con&s;table, having the ordering of the combat, was riding proudly about the field, exulting in his &s;ucce&s;sful trea&s;on, and anticipating, in his own mind, the ruin of the fair and injured Geneura. Ignorant though he was of the de&s;ign of this &s;ummons, yet coward guilt &s;ug|ge&s;ting the wor&s;t he had to fear, with a di&s;ordered air, and eyes expre&s;&s;ive of the various apprehen|&s;ions that &s;truck his con&s;cious &s;oul, he met the re|proachful look of his king, and the fierce glances of Rinaldo.</P>
<P>That noble warrior repeating in a few words the trea&s;ons he had been guilty of, challenged him to the field: Polyne&s;&s;o denied the accu&s;ation, but accepting the proferred combat, becau&s;e he could not avoid it, retired to arm him&s;elf, while Rinaldo, fraught with the pious prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of the king, entered the li&s;ts, and ordered his trumpet to &s;ound.</P>
<P>At the third bla&s;t the duke appeared; pale terror and di&s;may were pictured in his face, his fainting heart throbbed with the con&s;cious pangs of guilt, and horrors of impending fate: confu&s;ed, di&s;tract|ed, not knowing what he did, he darted forward at the &s;ignal given to begin the fight; but his
<PB N="771" REF="377">
weak lance, ill guided by his trembling hand, fell harmle&s;s to the ground.</P>
<P>Not &s;o the great Rinaldo; he, with calm courage, and brave, yet una&s;&s;uming confidence, meditated the wound, and ri&s;ing all collected to the blow, threw his famed lance with &s;uch unerring &s;kill and force, that it pierced quite through the armour of Polyne&s;&s;o, and hid its fatal point within his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The traitor fell, Rinaldo eagerly di&s;mounted, and approaching him, unlaced his helmet. With faint low voice he called for mercy, and thinking to de&s;erve it, confe&s;&s;ed una&s;ked the wrong he had been guilty of to Geneura; then, as if life had been only lent him till he had cleared her innocence, &s;carce had he uttered another prayer for mercy, but death &s;uppre&s;t the coward &s;upplication, and he lay a breathle&s;s coar&s;e at the feet of Rinaldo.</P>
<P>The people, tran&s;ported with joy that their prin|ce&s;s was not only delivered from death, but re&s;tored to her former &s;anctity of character, made the air re&s;ound with their acclamations.</P>
<P>Rinaldo being conducted to the king, untied the beaver of his helmet, and was immediately known to be that famous knight of Italy, who&s;e noble exploits were noi&s;ed over all the habitable world.</P>
<P>The king embraced him in a rapture of joy and gratitude; the nobles crouded round the deliverer of their prince&s;s, loaded him with ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;trove to exceed each other in prai&s;es of his in|vincible valour.</P>
<P>The&s;e congratulations over, all eyes were turned upon the unknown knight in black armour, who
<PB N="772" REF="378">
had &s;o generou&s;ly undertaken the defence of Ge|neura again&s;t her accu&s;er Lurcanio; pen&s;ive he &s;tood during the fight between Polyne&s;&s;o and Ri|naldo, his eyes fixed upon the combatants, with eager attention he had li&s;tened to the dying words of the treacherous duke, and while the multitude in loud &s;houts expre&s;&s;ed their joy, and the king and court were paying honours to the glorious vic|tor, he &s;tood apart from the throng, ab&s;orbed in thought, and wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the tumult a|round him.</P>
<P>The king cau&s;ed him to be conducted to his pre&s;ence, and acknowledging him&s;elf greatly ob|liged to his generous intention, pre&s;&s;ed him to let him know in what manner he could repay the obligation.</P>
<P>The knight made no an&s;wer, but bowing low, and throwing off his helmet, the king and court, with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld the lovely face of Ariodant; wonder and joy kept them all &s;ilent for a while; at length the king recovering from his &s;urprize, cla&s;p'd the young warrior to his brea&s;t with a tender embrace:</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, in a tone of voice expre&s;|&s;ive of the &s;tronge&s;t tran&s;port, that I behold again my Ariodant, the gallant defender of my domi|nions, and the brave champion for my daughter's honour? him whom I lamented as dead, whom my whole kingdom mourned for: tell me by what &s;trange yet happy chance I now behold thee living, who&s;e death was &s;o confidently affirmed, and &s;o univer&s;ally believed.</P>
<P><PB N="773" REF="379">Ariodant knowing the king was acquainted with the whole &s;tory of his love, replied without re&s;erve:</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant, my lord, whom I detained to be a witne&s;s of the &s;ad effects of my de&s;pair, and to bring the news of it to the prince&s;s, informed her truly that I ca&s;t my&s;elf from the rock into the &s;ea; but that natural repugnance we have all to death, when near, however we may de&s;pi&s;e its terrors at a di&s;tance, impelled me, involuntarily, to u&s;e mea|&s;ures to pre&s;erve a life which a moment before I had been &s;o de&s;irous of lo&s;ing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I ro&s;e again upon the &s;urface of the waves, I applied my&s;elf to &s;wimming, at which I was very expert, and &s;oon reached the neighbour|ing &s;hore, faint, weary, and almo&s;t breathle&s;s. I threw my&s;elf down amid&s;t the ru&s;hes, and was found in this condition by an ancient hermit, who&s;e cell was at a &s;mall di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thither he conducted me, and in a few days his charitable cares re&s;tored me to my &s;trength; but, alas! my mind was tortured &s;till with various pa&s;&s;ions; love, hate, de&s;pair, and eager thir&s;t of vengeance, by turns po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me; in vain I &s;ought to bani&s;h the idea of Geneura from my &s;oul, it &s;till returned with double force; nor could her in|fidelity, of which, mi&s;taken wretch that I was, I thought I had &s;uch convincing proofs, weaken the power of her re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charms.</P>
<P>Thus langui&s;hing, with a curele&s;s wound, I heard the news of her accu&s;ation by my brother, and the danger to which her life and honour were expo&s;ed; at that moment, forgetting the injuries
<PB N="774" REF="380">
I had &s;uffered, in&s;en&s;ible to all the ties of con|&s;anguinity and friend&s;hip, and only &s;olicitous for her &s;afety, I determined to fight with my brother in her defence, plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the thought, that if I did not free her, I &s;hould at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of dying in her cau&s;e, and thereby proving how much &s;uperior to Polyne&s;&s;o was my love, who though favoured as he was by her, he wanted courage to defend her.</P>
<P>Having provided my&s;elf with armour that might effectually conceal me, I came hither full of fury again&s;t my brother, whom I could not but con&s;ider as my wor&s;t enemy, &s;ince he was the accu&s;er of the &s;till adored Geneura.</P>
<P>The arrival of the brave Rinaldo happily pre|vented the continuance of a combat, which mu&s;t have ended in the death of one brother, and eter|nal remor&s;e to the other.</P>
<P>With joy I behold the prince&s;s delivered from the ignominious death with which &s;he was threaten|ed; but oh! with far more rapture do I congra|tulate your maje&s;ty on this di&s;covery of her inno|cence: Happy Rinaldo, to be at once the defender of her life, and re&s;torer of her honour: As for me, I &s;ought only to pre&s;erve her from death; and if that was denied me, to have the &s;atisfaction, at lea&s;t, of dying in her defence, by the hand of a friend and brother.</P>
<P>The king who loved him before for his virtues, was &s;o charmed with this generous proof of his pa&s;&s;ion for his daughter, that he ea&s;ily yielded to the &s;olicitations of Rinaldo and the noblemen of his court, to be&s;tow the prince&s;s on &s;o faithful a

lover; and endowing her with the dutchy of Al|bania, which, on Polyne&s;&s;o's decea&s;e, reverted to the crown, he gave her hand to Ariodant in the pre&s;ence of the whole court, and the nuptials were &s;oon after celebrated with the utmo&s;t magni|nificence.</P>
<P>Rinaldo having obtained Dalinda's pardon, who retired into a mona&s;try, took leave of the king and happy lovers, and pur&s;ued his voyage to England.</P>

<HEAD>TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the u&s;e of Hi&s;tory for Children.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN are very fond of &s;trange &s;to|ries: it is common to &s;ee them in high de|light, or in tears, at the recital of adventures: fail not to take advantage of this propen&s;ity; when|ever you find them di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten, tell them &s;ome &s;hort pretty fable, and let it be one relative to the animals, innocent and ingeniou&s;ly compo&s;ed: give them for what they are, fables; and explain the moral de&s;ign of them.</P>
<P>As for the heathen &s;tories, it will be happy for a girl to remain totally ignorant of them all her life-time; becau&s;e they are impure, and abound with impious ab&s;urdities; but if you cannot pre|vent an acquaintance with &s;ome, do your endea|vour to in&s;pire an abhorrence of them.</P>
<P>When you have told one &s;tory, &s;tay till the child a&s;ks for another, leaving as it were a craving upon him to be further informed; at length when his curio&s;ity becomes excited, then have &s;ome &s;elect
<PB N="777" REF="383">
pieces of hi&s;tory to relate, in a compendious man|ner: let there be a connection between them, and tell a particular part one day, and another the next, that he may be held in &s;u&s;pence, and in impatience to hear the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Animate your accounts with a lively tone of voice and expre&s;&s;ion; and make the per&s;onages &s;peak: children of a lively imagination will fancy they both hear and &s;ee them: for example, recite the &s;tory of Jo&s;eph; make the brothers &s;peak like bru|ti&s;h people; Jacob, like a fond afflicted father, Jo&s;eph, in his character, taking plea&s;ure, when be|come the ruler over Egypt, in keeping him&s;elf from being known by his brethren, then putting them in dread of him, and at la&s;t di&s;covering him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This natural repre&s;entation, joined to the won|ders of the hi&s;tory, will charm a child, provided he is not cloyed of &s;uch things, but left to a&s;k for them, or be promi&s;ed them under the notion of reward; and when he is grown wi&s;er, and pro|vided we never offer them by way of a ta&s;k, nor oblige them to a repetition; for this is a force upon him, and what will de&s;troy all the plea&s;ure he takes in the&s;e hi&s;torical pieces.</P>
<P>However, it is to be ob&s;erved, that if he hath any degree of facility in &s;peaking, he will be na|turally prone to relate to tho&s;e he loves, whatever &s;tories have given him the greate&s;t entertainment; but you are not to &s;et him this for a rule: you may get &s;ome per&s;on that is free with him to pretend a de&s;ire to hear the &s;tory; the child will be quite delighted to tell it, and do not &s;eem to mind him, nor take any notice of his mi&s;takes; when he comes
<PB N="778" REF="384">
to be better practi&s;ed, then you may with gentlene&s;s ob&s;erve to him what is the be&s;t manner of telling a tale, to make it &s;hort, plain, and natural, by the choice of &s;uch circum&s;tances as be&s;t &s;et forth things as they truly were. If you have a number of children, u&s;e them by degrees to repre&s;ent the &s;e|veral per&s;onages in the hi&s;tory they have learned: let one be Abraham, another I&s;aac, &amp;c. this per|&s;onating will delight them beyond other plays, and give them a habit of thinking and &s;peaking &s;eri|ous matters with plea&s;ure, and fix the tran&s;actions indelibly in their memory,</P>
<P>We ought to endeavour to give them a greater ta&s;te for &s;acred hi&s;tory than for any other; not by commending it as the fine&s;t, which perhaps they would not readily believe, but by bringing them to perceive it without a word &s;aid. Point out to their ob&s;ervation of what importance it is; how &s;in|gular, marvellous, replete with natural paintings and nobly &s;piritous; the articles of the creation, the fall of Adam, the deluge, the call of Abraham, the &s;acrifice of I&s;aac, the adventures of Jo&s;eph above|mentioned, the birth and flight of Mo&s;es, are not only proper to awake the curio&s;ity of children, but at the &s;ame time that they di&s;cover the origin of religion, they al&s;o lay the foundations of it in the young mind.</P>
<P>It would argue a profound ignorance of the e&s;|&s;ence of religon, not to &s;ee that it is entirely hi&s;to|rical: for by a web of marvellous facts, do we find its e&s;tabli&s;hment, its perpetuity, and all that ought to engage us to the belief and practice thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="779" REF="385">Let it not be imagined that we have any in|tention that people &s;hould dip into &s;cience when we propo&s;e the&s;e hi&s;tories to them; for they are brief, various, and proper to plea&s;e the mo&s;t ordi|nary under&s;tandings. God, who be&s;t knows the &s;pirit of man whom he created, hath thrown reli|gion among popular facts, which far from over|charging the &s;imple, a&s;&s;i&s;t them rather to conceive and retain the &s;en&s;e of its my&s;tery: for in&s;tance, tell a child, that in God three co-equal per&s;ons make but one &s;ingle nature; by hearing and repeating the&s;e terms, he will remember them; but, I doubt, not conceive the &s;en&s;e of them. Tell him then, how when Je&s;us Chri&s;t came out of the water of Jordan, the Father cau&s;ed the&s;e words to be heard from heaven:
<Q>This is my beloved &s;on, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him.</Q>
Add, that the Holy Spirit de&s;cended upon our Saviour, in a bodily &s;hape, like a dove, and you will make him &s;en|&s;ibly perceive the Trinity in a pa&s;&s;age which he will never forget: here are three per&s;ons whom he will ever di&s;tingu&s;h by their different ac|tions; you have but to teach him, that all taken together con&s;titute but one God.</P>
<P>This example &s;uffices to &s;how the u&s;e of hi&s;tory, which, though it &s;eems to be a prolix method of in&s;truction, is in reality the mo&s;t compendious, and avoids the dry way of catechi&s;ms, wherein the my&s;teries are disjoined from the facts; and we may know, that in the antient times they taught by means of hi&s;tory. The admirable method of teach|ing which St. Au&s;tin pre&s;cribes, was not of that father's introduction; it was the univer&s;al practice
<PB N="780" REF="386">
of the chuch: this con&s;i&s;ted in demon&s;trating, by a &s;eries of hi&s;torical facts, religion to be as old as the world, Je&s;us Chri&s;t expected in the old te&s;tament, Je&s;us Chri&s;t reigning in the new: this is the bot|tom of chri&s;tian in&s;truction.</P>
<P>This requires &s;omewhat more time and applica|tion than the method of teaching to which &s;ome people confine them&s;elves; however, by this &s;eries of hi&s;tory we are brought to a true knowledge of religion; whereas, when unacquainted with it, we have but confu&s;ed notions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the go&s;pel, the church, and of the foundation of tho&s;e virtues with which the name of chri&s;tian ought to in&s;pire us.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torical catechi&s;m printed a little while ago, a plain book, &s;hort, and much clearer than the common catechi&s;ms, includes all nece&s;&s;ary to be known on that head, and of this no one will &s;ay that it requires a great deal of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>To the pa&s;&s;ages I have beforementioned, let us add, the going thorough the Red Sea, the &s;ojourn|ment of the people in the de&s;ert, where they eat the bread which fell from heaven, and drank of the water which Mo&s;es, by the &s;troke of his rod, made to &s;pring out of the rock.</P>

<P>Make the prophets &s;peak to the king, in the name of the Lord; let them read futurity as a volume; appear humble, of au&s;tere life, and &s;uf|fering continual per&s;ecution for the truth's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Place in its due point of time the fir&s;t de&s;truc|tion of Jeru&s;alem; de&s;cribe the temple burned, and the holy city ruined for the &s;ins of the people: relate the captivity in Babylon, where the Jews be|wailed their beloved Sion: before their return bring in the plea&s;ing relations of what befel Tobit, Ju|dith, E&s;ther, and Daniel.</P>
<P>It would have its u&s;efulne&s;s, if children were brought to declare their thoughts on the different characters of the&s;e Saints, to know which affected them mo&s;t: one would prefer E&s;ther, another Judith: this would create a little contention, and &s;o more &s;trongly impre&s;s the &s;tories upon their minds, and help to form their judgment.</P>
<P>After this, bring the people up to Jeru&s;alem, and let them repair the ruins thereof; then form a love|ly picture of the peace and pro&s;perity of the city; in a &s;hort time after, give the portrait of that cruel and impious Antiochus, who died in hypocritical penitence.</P>

<P>Tell how he taught the Samaritan woman, how cured the man born blind, rai&s;ed Lazarus from the dead; &s;hew Je&s;us Chri&s;t entering triumphant into Jeru&s;alem, &s;hew him upon the cro&s;s, and at length ri&s;ing out of the Sepulchre.&mdash;After this it &s;hould be remarked, with how much familiarity he con|&s;orted with his Di&s;ciples for forty days together, even till they beheld him a&s;cend up into Heaven; &mdash;be&s;ides this, the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t, the &s;toning of St. Stephen, the conver&s;ion of Paul, the calling of the centurion Cornelius, the travels of the apo&s;tles, and particularly of St. Paul, are exceedingly engaging: chu&s;e out the mo&s;t wonder|ful &s;tories of the martyrs, and &s;omething in gene|ral of the heavenly life of the primitive Chri&s;tians, inter&s;per&s;ed with in&s;tances of the courage of young virgins, the a&s;toni&s;hing au&s;terities of the hermits, the conver&s;ion of the emperors and of the em|pire, the blindne&s;s of the Jews, and their terrible puni&s;hment, which la&s;teth to this day.</P>
<P><PB N="783" REF="389">The&s;e narrations will, in a delightful manner, impre&s;s on the tender and lively imagination of a child an entire &s;eries of religion from the crea|tion of the world to our days; give them noble ideas of it, and &s;uch as will never be effaced; they will perceive likewi&s;e in that hi&s;tory the hand of God ever lifted up to deliver the righte|ous, and to confound the wicked.</P>
<P>They will be u&s;ed to &s;ee God, the efficient cau&s;e, in all things, drawing interceptibly into his de|&s;igns tho&s;e of his creatures that &s;eem mo&s;t repug|nant to them.</P>
<P>But as to this collection of extracts, let it con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as afford the plea&s;ante&s;t, the mo&s;t magni|ficent images; for we &s;hould by all means &s;o ma|nage it, that children may find religion charming, lovely, venerable; whereas their common notion of it is as of &s;omething melancholy, flat, and doleful.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ine&s;timable benefit of thus teaching them religion, all the&s;e delightful narrations, &s;o early infu&s;ed into their memories, awaken a curio|&s;ity to be informed of things in their nature &s;eri|ous, render them &s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ures of the under&s;tanding, and intere&s;t them in whatever parts of hi&s;tory happen to bear any relation to &s;uch as they have already learned.</P>
<P>Yet, I &s;ay again, great care mu&s;t be taken ne|ver to lay it down for a rule, that they mu&s;t attend to you, mu&s;t remember all; much more, never to pre&s;cribe &s;tated le&s;&s;ons: no, let plea&s;ure effect every thing.</P>
<P><PB N="784" REF="390">Do not urge them, and you will bring it to bear: even for ordinary under&s;tandings, the point is not to overcharge them, but wait the gradual ri&s;e of their curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>But it will be objected&mdash;to relate the&s;e &s;everal parts of hi&s;tory in a lively, conci&s;e, natural, and plea&s;ing manner, where are the governe&s;&s;es capable of it? To which I an&s;wer, that, in propo&s;ing it, I mean that people &s;hould endeavour to procure for their children per&s;ons of good parts, and put them as much as po&s;&s;ible into this method of teach|ing, and &s;o every governe&s;s will perform accord|ing to her talent: but &s;till, whatever her capacity is, matters will not go quite &s;o wrong, when this natural and plain method is in practice.</P>
<P>To their narrations they may add the &s;ight of prints or pictures, repre&s;enting the &s;acred &s;tories: prints will &s;erve for general u&s;e. But if there &s;hould be an opportunity of &s;hewing the children good pictures, let it not be neglected; for the glow of colours, and &s;ize of figures as big as the life, &s;trike the imagination with much greater force.</P>

<HEAD>THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DESCRIPTION of the I&s;land of CEYLON. [Continued from Page 720.]</HEAD>
<P>ALL the kinds of fruits which the Indies in general produce, are found in this i&s;land; it has however &s;ome peculiar to it&s;elf; among which one of the mo&s;t particular is the Jacks, a fruit which is of very great &s;ervice in food; it grows on a very high tree, is of a greeni&s;h colour, covered over with prickles, and is about the &s;ize of a loaf of eighteen pounds weight. Its &s;eeds, or what they call its eggs, are di&s;po&s;ed in the in&s;ide of it, like the &s;eeds of a gourd. They eat the jacks as we eat cabbage, and its ta&s;te is not ex|tremely unlike it. When it is ripe it may be eaten raw, and one of them is &s;ufficient for &s;ix or &s;even people. The grain or eggs re&s;emble che&s;|nuts very much, both in colour and ta&s;te; they may be eaten either boiled, or roa&s;ted in a&s;hes: one jacks produces two or three quarts of them, and the inhabitants always keep &s;tore of them by them.</P>
<P>The Jombs is another fruit which is pecu|liar to the i&s;land: it has the ta&s;te of an apple, is very full of juice, and is no le&s;s whole&s;ome than agreeable. Its colour is white, mixed with red, in a manner that appears to be the work of an elegant pencil. There are al&s;o &s;everal wild fruits
<PB N="786" REF="392">
which are to be met with in their woods, as, the Mucroes, which are round, of the &s;ize of a cher|ry, and of a very agreeable ta&s;te. The Dongs, which re&s;emble black cherries; the Ambellos, which may be compared to our goo&s;eberries; the Carollas, Cabellas, Tookes, and Jollas, which may pa&s;s for &s;o many &s;orts of very good plumbs, and the Paragiddes, which are not unlike our pears.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Ceylon produces three trees, which, though their fruits are not indeed fit to eat, are no le&s;s remarkable for other convenien|cies: the fir&s;t, which is named Tallipot, is very &s;trait, and in heighth and thickne&s;s nearly re|&s;embles the ma&s;t of a &s;hip; its leaves are &s;o large, that a &s;ingle one will cover fifteen or twenty men, and &s;helter them from the rain. They grow &s;tronger as they dry, without becoming le&s;s pli|able or manageable. Nature could &s;carcely have be&s;towed any gift on the inhabitants more value|able than this; although the leaves are &s;o very exten&s;ive when open, they can be folded up like a fan, and being then not thicker than one's arm, weigh very little in the hand. Their &s;hape is round, but the Ceylone&s;e cut them into triangular pieces, wherewith they cover them&s;elves when they travel, taking care to place the pointed end before them, which therefore makes its way the ea&s;ier through the &s;hrubs. The &s;oldiers make tents of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e leaves grow at the top of the tree, like tho&s;e of the cocoa; but, what is very extraordi|nary, it bears no fruit till the year of its death, at which time alone, it puts forth large branches,
<PB N="787" REF="393">
laden with very beautiful yellow flowers, but of a very &s;trong and offen&s;ive &s;mell, which changes into a round, hard fruit, of the &s;ize of our large&s;t cherries, but which are good for nothing but to &s;ow. Thus the Tillipot bears but once, but then it is &s;o loaded with fruit at that time, that one tree is &s;ufficient for the &s;owing of a whole province. Yet the &s;mell of the flowers is &s;o in&s;ufferable near hou&s;es, that they &s;eldom fail to cut down the tree &s;o &s;oon as it begins to put forth buds, e&s;pecially as at that time, if they are cut, there is found within them an exceeding good &s;ap, which may be reduced to meal, and made up in cakes, that have the ta&s;te of white bread. This is al&s;o ano|ther re&s;ource for the inhabitants when the rice har|ve&s;t happens to turn out indifferently.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of the&s;e trees is the Kitula, which grows as &s;trait as the cocoa, but not &s;o tall, and by many degrees &s;lenderer. Its principal &s;ingula|rity con&s;i&s;ts in its yielding a kind of liquor which is called Tellegie, very &s;weet, whole&s;ome, and agreeable, but without any &s;trength. The liquor they collect twice a-day, and from &s;ome of the be&s;t trees three times; the quantity of the whole frequently amounting to &s;ix quarts in a day. They boil it up till it acquires the con&s;i&s;tence and appearance of dark powder &s;ugar; and this the inhabitants call Jaggory. With very little more trouble they might render it as white as &s;ugar, to which, in every other re&s;pect, it is no way in|ferior in goodne&s;s. The manner of getting this liquor is as follows:</P>
<P>When the tree comes to its maturity it puts
<PB N="788" REF="394">
forth, towards its extremities, a little button, which changes into a round fruit, and is, proper|ly &s;peaking, the &s;eed. This button they open, putting into it various ingredients, &s;uch as &s;alt, pepper, citron, garlic, and various kinds of leaves, which prevent it from ripening &s;o &s;oon as it would otherwi&s;e do. Every day, at certain times, they cut off a little piece towards the end of this, from which place the liquor flows out in abun|dance. As this button ripens and withers, others grow lower and lower every year, till they at length reach the bottom of the branches; but when this comes to be the ca&s;e, which is in about eight or ten years, the tree cea&s;es to bear, and pre&s;ently after dies.</P>
<P>Its leaves re&s;emble tho&s;e of the cocoa-palm, and are covered with a kind of bark extremely hard and full of filaments, which are employed in the making of ropes: they fall during the whole time that the tree is growing; but when it has arrived at its full dimen&s;ions, they remain on it for many years, and when they do fall, are never &s;upplied by any others.</P>
<P>The wood, which is &s;eldom above three inches thick, &s;erves as a velopement to a very thick pith; it is extremely hard and heavy, but very apt to &s;plit of it&s;elf. The colour of it is black, and looks as if it was compo&s;ed of inlaid work. The Ceylone&s;e make pe&s;tles of it to beat the rice withal.</P>
<P>The third extraordinary tree, and indeed what renders this i&s;land &s;o extremely valuable to the Dutch, is that which bears the cinnamon: it is
<PB N="789" REF="395">
called in the language of the country Corunda|gouhah. It grows in the woods indi&s;criminately with other trees, and, what is &s;omewhat extraordi|nary, the Ceylone&s;e &s;et no extraordinary value up|on it. This tree is of a middling bulk, its bark is the cinnamon, which appears white when on the trunk, but which they take off, and dry it in the &s;un. The i&s;landers gather this only from the &s;maller trees, although the bark of the larger ones &s;mell as &s;weet, and have as &s;trong a ta&s;te. The wood has no &s;mell; it is white, and about the hardne&s;s of deal, and is u&s;ed for all kinds of pur|po&s;es. Its leaf is not unlike that of the laurel, but when it fir&s;t begins to put forth is of a bright &s;carlet, and rubbed between the hands has more the &s;mell of a clove gillyflower than that of the cinnamon. The fruit, which u&s;ually ripens about September, is like an acorn, but &s;maller, and has le&s;s both of &s;mell and ta&s;te than the bark. They boil them in water, in order to extract an oil from them, which &s;wims at the top, and, when con|gealed, becomes as hard and as white as tallow, and of a very agreeable &s;mell. The inhabitants anoint their bodies with it, and al&s;o burn it in their lamps, but no candles are made of it, but for the King.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to animals, the i&s;land of Ceylon produces a great variety; viz. cows, buffaloes, &s;wine, goats, deer, hares, dogs, jackalls, apes, ty|gers, bears, wild bears, elephants, lions, hor&s;es, and a&s;&s;es; but no &s;heep. Among&s;t the fallow bea&s;ts they have one called the Memima, which is no bigger than a hare, but much re&s;embles a
<PB N="590" REF="396">
deer; its colour is grey, &s;potted with white, and its fle&s;h is excellent. The Ganvera is a kind of wild buck, which has a very &s;harp chine, its four feet white, and half the legs of the &s;ame colour. Knox gives an account of his having &s;een one, which was kept in the king's magazine, together with a black tyger, a white deer, and a &s;potted elephant.</P>
<P>The apes are not only in prodigious abundance in the woods, but al&s;o of many various kinds, whereof there are &s;ome very different from any that are to be found in other countries. Some of them are as large as our &s;paniels, with grey hair and black faces, and long white beards, reaching from ear to ear, which give them greatly the ap|pearance of old men. There are others of the &s;ame &s;ize, but differing in colour, their bodies, faces, and beards, being all of a bright white. But as this difference of colour does not &s;eem to form any &s;pecific difference in the animal, they are both alike named Wanderous: they do but little mi&s;chief, keeping con&s;tantly in the woods, where they feed entirely on leaves and buds.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort, called Killowan, which are beardle&s;s, but have a white face, and long hair on their heads, which de&s;cend and divide like tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies: this kind are ex|tremely mi&s;chievous, from the continual ravage they commit among&s;t the grain. The Ceylone&s;e are extremely fond of the fle&s;h of all their kinds of apes, as well as of that of their &s;quirrels, whereof they have al&s;o &s;everal different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The variety of ants in the i&s;land of Ceylon is
<PB N="791" REF="397">
no le&s;s admirable than their abundance. That which they call Coumbias, and Tale-Coumbias, are very much like ours in &s;ize, with this dif|ference, that the fir&s;t are reddi&s;h, and the others, which are black, are only to be found in rotten trees, and have a very di&s;agreeable &s;mell.</P>
<P>There is a third kind, called Dimbios, which are large and red, and make their ne&s;ts on the branches of large trees, in leaves which they ama&s;s together, to the bulk of a man's head. Several ne&s;ts are &s;ometimes found on one tree, and the fear of a thou&s;and dangerous things will then pre|vent any per&s;on from attempting to climb up it.</P>
<P>The Coura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atches are a fourth kind of ants; they are large and black, live under ground, and form holes there, nearly of the &s;hape of rabbit-burrows, and the fields are &s;o full of the&s;e holes, that the cattle are in perpetual danger from them of breaking their legs.</P>
<P>A fifth &s;ort are the Codd as: they are of a very fine black, much about the &s;ize of the former, and live al&s;o in the earth; but they frequently make excur&s;ions in very numerous parties, without any one knowing the peculiar period of their expedi|tion. They bite cruelly if hurt or put out of their way, but otherwi&s;e, if unmole&s;ted, they are very harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t numerous, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t extraordinary of all the kinds of ants is, that which they call the Vacos. The ground is covered with them: they are of a middling &s;ize, have a white body, and red head, and devour every thing that comes in their way. They eat
<PB N="792" REF="398">
cloth, wood, the &s;traw wherewith the hou&s;es are thatched, and, in &s;hort, every thing but iron and &s;tone. No one dares to leave any thing in an un|inhabited hou&s;e; they get up along the walls, making a rhind of earth as they go along, which they continue through the whole extent of their way, to what height &s;oever they arrive. If this arcade happens to break, they all immediately re|turn back again, to repair their building, and con|tinue their march a&s;&s;oon as they have completed the work. The inhabitants ea&s;ily perceive their approach by the &s;ight of the&s;e little vaults, and are obliged to u&s;e continual precaution to de&s;troy or drive them away. In places which are without hou&s;es, they rai&s;e up little mountains of earth, of four, five, or &s;ix feet in height, and &s;o &s;trong, that it is not ea&s;y to de&s;troy them, even with a &s;pade. The&s;e little huts, which are called Hum|bo&s;&s;es, are compo&s;ed of vaults or arcades, and built of very fine earth, which the people make u&s;e of for the fabrication of their idols.</P>
<P>The Vacos multiply prodigiou&s;ly, but they al&s;o die by myriads, for when they acquire their wings, they take their flight in &s;uch inconceivable num|bers towards the we&s;t, that they almo&s;t ob&s;cure the sky, and ri&s;ing to &s;o great a height as to be quite lo&s;t to the view, they cea&s;e not their flight till they drop down dead, exhau&s;ted with fatigue; they then become a prey to birds of many kinds, and chickens in particular will feed on them more readily than on even the rice.</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOCRATES and ARISTARCHUS.</HEAD>
<P>SOCRATES one day ob&s;erving Ari&s;tarchus to look thoughtful and melancholy, &s;aid to him,
<Q>My friend, &s;omething &s;eems to lie heavy upon your mind, you &s;hould &s;hare the burden with your friends; perhaps we may be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>To which Ari&s;tarchus replied,
<Q>Indeed, So|crates, I am in great perplexity. You know that on account of the war a great multitude have for&s;aken the open country, and fled into the Piraeum; and there are come to my hou&s;e &s;o many helple&s;s &s;i&s;ters, nieces, and cou&s;ins, that I have not le&s;s than fourteen gentlewomen&mdash; Now from our landed e&s;tates we get nothing, for the enemy is ma&s;ter there; nor from rent of hou&s;es, inhabitants are &s;o thin in the city; fur|niture no body will buy; and money there is none to be borrowed: one may as &s;oon expect to find it in walking along the &s;treets as to bor|row any.&mdash;It is grievous, Socrates, to &s;tand and &s;ee our relations peri&s;h; it is impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="796" REF="402">
&s;upport &s;uch a number of them in &s;uch times.</Q></P>
<P>Socrates hearing all this, replied,
<Q>And how comes it to pa&s;s that Reramo, who has a great family to maintain, not only finds means to pro|vide him&s;elf and them with all nece&s;&s;aries, but likewi&s;e has &s;o much to &s;pare that he even grows rich by what he vends?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Good rea&s;on, replied the other, becau&s;e he keeps &s;laves, and I gentlefolks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And of the&s;e two &s;orts of people which may you reckon the mo&s;t valuable, his &s;laves or your gentlefolks?</Q>
&s;aid Socrates.</P>
<P>"Surely mine," &s;ays Ari&s;tarchus.</P>
<P><Q>But then is it not a di&s;grace, &s;ays the philo&s;o|pher, that while he is thriving by the means of a parcel of &s;laves, you &s;hould be driven to extre|mity with tho&s;e that are &s;o much their bet|ters?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Oh! but, &s;ays the other, he feeds handicraft&s;|men, I people who have been genteelly brought up.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you mean by handicraft&s;men, re|plied Socrates, tho&s;e who are skilled in prepar|ing the u&s;eful things of life.</Q></P>
<P>"Yes, I do," &s;aid the other.</P>
<P>"Is meal in that number?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly."</P>

<P><PB N="797" REF="403">
<Q>Probably, continued Socrates, your people are not at all skilled in making any of the&s;e things?</Q></P>
<P>"O yes, one or other in all or mo&s;t of them?"</P>
<P><Q>Po&s;&s;ibly then, &s;aid Socrates, you don't know that by means of one &s;ingle article Nau&s;icydes, the mealman, not only maintains him&s;elf and &s;e|veral &s;ervants, but likewi&s;e a great number of hogs and cows; and hath &s;o thriven as even to be named for &s;erving the expen&s;ive offices of the &s;tate: and that Kerybus, by his bu&s;ine&s;s of a baker, &s;upports a large family; nay lives in plenty:&mdash; then there's Demeas, the taylor, and numbers of Megareans that get a fine livelihood by mercery ware.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Defend me! &s;ays the other, the&s;e fellows are owners of many purcha&s;ed &s;laves, whom they force to work, and by their labours they thrive; but I tell you, I have none but gentry and my relations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pray now, becau&s;e they are gentry and your relations, &s;ays Socrates, do you think they have nothing to do but to eat and &s;leep? or among people of the like condition do you reckon tho&s;e that live after that manner, to pa&s;s their time more happily than others that both know and practi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary employments of life? or do you apprehend &s;loth and idlene&s;s to be more conducive towards a man's learning what he ought to under&s;tand, or remembering what he has learned, or to his health and &s;trength of bo|dy, or, in fine, toward his attaining or pre&s;erv|ing the requi&s;ites of life? while indu&s;try and care
<PB N="798" REF="404">
are nothing worth. You confe&s;s they have been taught to do &s;ome of the&s;e works&mdash;why&mdash;be|cau&s;e they were things of no &s;ervice, or &s;uch as they mu&s;t never put their hands to; or ra|ther on the contrary, as what they might one day labour in, and profit by&mdash;for which makes men the mo&s;t virtuous&mdash;living in idlene&s;s, or being engaged in a u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s?&mdash;or hone&s;t|e&s;t, the being employed, or lazily to be talking how they &s;hall live? Yet more, it is my opi|nion, that neither you love them, nor they you&mdash;not them, for you really feel them very burthen&s;ome to you; they love not you, for they mu&s;t &s;ee you are quite weary of them&mdash;from whence 'tis a great chance but di&s;like and en|mity will &s;pring up more and more, while kin|dred and affection fades away. Now could you contrive to make your&s;elf their director and protector in &s;ome kind of profitable employ|ment, you would then be fond of them, finding them u&s;eful to you, and they would love you, becau&s;e they would perceive you had plea&s;ure in what they did; and then, reflecting with &s;atisfaction on all former benefits, the obliga|tion to them would be enhanced, and you would grow friendlier and dearer to each other every day.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If any thing &s;candalous was propo&s;ed to be done, death is rather to be cho&s;en; but now the&s;e women know to perform what is very laudable, very becoming their &s;ex&mdash;and what|ever we know how to do, that we do with
<PB N="799" REF="405">

<P><Q>By all the gods! &s;aid Ari&s;tarchus, you give me &s;uch admirable advice, Socrates, that I, who lately dared not think of borrowing, being &s;ure that when that money was gone I &s;hould never be able to di&s;charge the debt, am now re&s;olved to venture upon it to begin our undertaking.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, money was rai&s;ed, a quantity of wool laid in, the women worked, even while they eat their dinner, they worked till &s;upper time: &s;orrow was turned into joy; in&s;tead of &s;our glances they looked with chearfulne&s;s on each other; they loved him as their guardian, he them as a &s;et of u&s;eful relations.</P>
<P>Some time after he came again to Socrates, and with plea&s;ure in his face gave him an account of their proceedings, and added,
<Q>They now accu&s;e me as the only per&s;on that eats idle bread in the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, &s;ays Socrates, and don't you tell them the fable of the dog? Upon a time when ani|mals could &s;peak, a &s;heep talked to her ma&s;ter in this manner, 'We are va&s;tly &s;urpri&s;ed that to us, who afford you wool, and lamb, and chee&s;e, you never allow any other food but merely what the earth produces: whereas your dog, by whom you get nothing, comes in for a &s;nap of every &s;ort of victuals you eat your&s;elf.' The dog overhearing this, cries, 'Aye, but 'tis to me you owe your &s;afety, that you are neither &s;tole
<PB N="800" REF="406">
by the rogues, nor devoured by the wolves: was not I to watch over you ye dur&s;t not go to pa&s;ture for your lives;' this convinced the &s;heep of the dog's merit. Tell them, therefore, that you, like the dog, are their guardian and careful over&s;eer, by who&s;e means they live to follow their employments with plea&s;ure and &s;afety.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT and SOPHIA CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P>SOPHIA was not deceived when &s;he imagined &s;he had &s;een Sir Charles, it was really he who had rode by her window, and it was her little abode he was in &s;earch of, though in his extreme eager|ne&s;s he had overlooked it.</P>
<P>He had left England with a hope that change of &s;cene, and a variety of new objects, would efface the idea of Sophia from his heart, and re&s;tore him to his former tranquility; but amid&s;t all the de|lights of Paris he found him&s;elf oppre&s;t with lan|guor: no amu&s;ements could entertain him, no conver&s;ation engage his attention; di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing he &s;aw and heard, peevi&s;h, di&s;|contented, and weary of the world, he avoided all company, and had recour&s;e to books for relief; but Sophia was too much in his thoughts to render &s;tudy either in&s;tructive or amu&s;ing. He pa&s;t whole days in &s;olitude, feeding his melancholy with the reflection of a thou&s;and pa&s;t circum&s;tances,
<PB N="802" REF="408">
which &s;erved to &s;often his mind, and make him feel his lo&s;s more &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>When he reflected on her exalted virtues, her wit, her elegance, the attractive graces of her per|&s;on, and the irre&s;i&s;table &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, he lamented his hard fate that had put &s;uch a trea&s;ure out of his reach; but when his con&s;cience told him that it had once been in his power to have become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of this trea&s;ure, that he had trifled with that innocent affection till he had alienated it from him&s;elf to another object; his angui&s;h became in&s;upportable, and he &s;ought to relieve it by rou&s;ing his indignation again&s;t her, for her preference of &s;o unworthy a rival.</P>
<P>He called to mind her interview with this happy rival in the field, and concluded he was far more favoured by her than him&s;elf had ever been, &s;ince her di&s;cour&s;e to him had produced &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate an expre&s;&s;ion of acknowledgment as that he had beheld.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, which his imagination dwelt upon in order to le&s;&s;en his regret, added to it all the &s;tings of jealou&s;y; &s;o that, almo&s;t frantic with rage and grief, he was a hundred times upon the point of committing &s;ome de&s;perate action.</P>
<P>A violent fever was the con&s;equence of the&s;e tran&s;ports, which, after confining him a long time to his bed, left his body in a weak and langui&s;h|ing condition, and his mind &s;unk in an habitual melancholy.</P>
<P>His phy&s;icians recommended to him the air of Montpelier, and he was preparing to &s;et out for
<PB N="803" REF="409">
that place when he happened to meet with a gen|tleman who made him alter his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>This per&s;on had been his governor, and now attended Mr. Howard in the &s;ame quality.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, who had a &s;light acquaintance with Mrs. Howard, was prevailed upon, notwith&s;tand|ing his aver&s;ion to company, to receive a vi&s;it from her &s;on: he invited the young gentleman to dine with him, and he having not yet forgot the lovely Sophia, drank her health after dinner by the name of mi&s;s Darnley.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, who could not hear that name with|out a vi&s;ible emotion, told him he knew two young ladies &s;o called, and asked whether it was the el|de&s;t or the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter that he meant?</P>
<P>Mr. Howard replied,
<Q>That he was ignorant till then that mi&s;s Darnley had a &s;i&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yes, &s;he has a &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid his governor, who is much hand&s;omer than her&s;elf, and for whom a youthful pa&s;&s;ion would be far more excu&s;able.</Q></P>
<P>The young gentleman, who knew his governor talked in that contemptuous manner of Sophia in compliance with his mother's humour, in revenge avowed his admiration of her in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate terms, and, forgetting that Sir Charles had &s;aid he was acquainted with her, de&s;cribed her excel|lencies with all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a lover.</P>
<P>Sir Charles li&s;tened in &s;ilence; and when the other had done &s;peaking told him, with an air of forced gravity, that it was ea&s;y to &s;ee he was very much in love.</P>
<P>This, indeed, was his real opinion; neverthele&s;s he felt no emotions of jealou&s;y or re&s;entment
<PB N="804" REF="410">
again&s;t a rival whom he believed was as unhappy as him&s;elf: he asked him with a &s;eeming carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s if mi&s;s Sophia was not to be married to the &s;on of a rich farmer in the village where &s;he lived? and waited his an&s;wer with an agitation of mind which appeared &s;o plainly in the frequent changes of his colour, that Mr. Howard mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved it, had not the que&s;tion given him almo&s;t as much concern.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e he replied,
<Q>That he never heard &s;he was going to be married;</Q>
but, added he, &s;ighing,
<Q>I remember I have &s;een a very hand&s;ome young man at Mr. Law&s;on's, who perhaps &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>Aye, aye, interrupted his governor, &s;miling, he was the favoured lover no doubt, you have nothing to do but to forget her as &s;oon as you can.</Q></P>
<P>The youth &s;at pen&s;ive and &s;ilent for &s;ome time, then &s;uddenly ri&s;ing, took leave of Sir Charles and went away; his governor prepared to follow him, but the baronet, anxious to hear more of Sophia, detained him to ask &s;everal que&s;tions concerning her acquaintance with Mr. Howard.</P>
<P>Sir Charles found his old friend had lo&s;t no part of his former candor and &s;incerity: though by the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him he was obliged to di&s;|countenance as much as po&s;&s;ible the pa&s;&s;ion of his pupil for a young woman &s;o much his inferior in rank and fortune; yet having &s;een and conver&s;ed with Sophia, he did ju&s;tice to her extraordinary merit, and acknowledged that Mrs. Howard had treated her har&s;hly.</P>
<P><PB N="805" REF="411">He related to Sir Charles in what manner Mrs. Howard had invited her to her hou&s;e, and the &s;u&s;picions &s;he entertained of Sophia's encouraging her &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ign to en&s;nare him into a clande&s;tine marriage.
<Q>Su&s;picions, added he, which her &s;ub&s;equent behaviour entirely de|&s;troyed, for the youth was ra&s;h enough to avow his pa&s;&s;ion openly, and &s;olicited her by frequent letters and me&s;&s;ages to grant him an interview, which &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and this conduct did her honour and procured her great e&s;teem; yet it is very likely that her affections are other|wi&s;e engaged, and that &s;he has &s;ome difficulties to encounter, for &s;he looks thoughtful and me|lancholy, and affects retirement more than per|&s;ons of her age generally do.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles was thrown into &s;o profound a re|verie by this account of Sophia, that he heard not a word of what his friend afterwards &s;aid which had no relation to this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, and &s;carce perceived when he went away.</P>
<P>After reflecting a long time with mingled grief, re&s;entment, and compa&s;&s;ion, upon her melancho|ly, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome di&s;|appointment in the affair of her marriage with the young farmer, and which probably her want of fortune was the cau&s;e of, he &s;uddenly formed the generous de&s;ign of removing this ob&s;tacle to her union with the per&s;on whom &s;he preferred to him, and, by making her happy, entitle him&s;elf to her e&s;teem, &s;ince he had unfortunately lo&s;t her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="806" REF="412">The novelty of this re&s;olution, and its extraor|dinary genero&s;ity, filled him with &s;o many &s;elf-flattering ideas, as &s;u&s;pended for a while his jea|lou&s;y and his grief.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of going to Montpelier he &s;et out im|mediately for England, and during his journey was continually applauding him&s;elf for the uncommon di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his conduct.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the motives even of our be&s;t actions will not always bear exami|nation: we deceive our&s;elves fir&s;t, and our vanity is too much intere&s;ted in the deception, to make us wi&s;h to detect it. Sir Charles either did not or would not perceive the latent hope that lurked within his bo&s;om, and which, perhaps, &s;ugge&s;ted the de&s;igns he had formed.</P>
<P>How mu&s;t &s;uch an in&s;tance of generous pa&s;&s;ion, thought he, affect a mind &s;o delicately &s;en&s;ible as Sophia's! &s;he who had once loved him, and what was more than probable, had not yet entirely forgot him.</P>
<P>He never asked him&s;elf, why his imagination dwelt upon the&s;e plea&s;ing images? why he pro|&s;ecuted his journey with &s;uch eager ha&s;te, as if the purport of it was to receive, not to re&s;ign for ever the woman he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved?</P>
<P>When he arrived at his own hou&s;e &s;carce would he allow him&s;elf a few minutes re&s;t after his fa|tiguing journey: he ha&s;tened to Mr. Herbert's lodgings, to prevail upon him to ju&s;tify by his concurrence the de&s;igns he had formed in favour of Sophia.</P>
<P><PB N="807" REF="413">Mean time the &s;ecret and powerful impul&s;e by which he was actuated, kept his mind in a con|tinual tumult. He hoped, he feared, he wi&s;hed: he was all anxious expectation, all trembling doubt; he heard with grief that Mr. Herbert was at Bath; for now he knew not how to get acce&s;s to Sophia, who being ignorant of his intentions, and offended by his behaviour, might po&s;&s;ibly refu&s;e to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>He went to the hou&s;e where Mrs. Darnley lived when he left England; he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it &s;hut up. This incident perplexed him more, and rendered him more impatient.</P>
<P>He returned to his hou&s;e, ordered his hor&s;es to be &s;addled, and &s;et out immediately for Mr. Law|&s;on's; where he arrived before he had re&s;olved how to introduce him&s;elf, or who he &s;hould en|quire for.</P>
<P>However, upon the appearance of a &s;ervant at the door, he asked for Mr. Herbert; which Mr. Law&s;on hearing, came out him&s;elf, and, though he did not know Sir Charles, politely reque&s;ted him to alight, telling him, he had ju&s;t received a letter from Mr. Herbert, which acquainted him that he was perfectly recovered, and that he was on the way to London.</P>
<P>Sir Charles accepted Mr. Law&s;on's invitation, and alighting, followed him into a parlour, but in &s;uch perturbation of mind that he &s;carce knew what he did. The good curate, &s;urpri&s;ed at the pen&s;ivene&s;s and &s;ilence of his gue&s;t, was at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay to him, or how to entertain him: he gave him an account of Mr. Herbert's illne&s;s,
<PB N="808" REF="414">
which &s;eemed to engage his attention very little; but happening to mention Sophia in the cour&s;e of his relation, the young baronet &s;tarted as from a dream, and turned his eyes upon him with a look of eagerne&s;s and anxiety, but &s;aid not a word.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on pau&s;ed, as expecting he was going to ask him a que&s;tion, which Sir Charles perceiv|ing, &s;aid with &s;ome confu&s;ion,
<Q>I beg your par|don, Sir, you mentioned mi&s;s Sophia, I have the honour to know her, pray how does me do?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope &s;he is well, Sir, replied Mr. Law&s;on, I have not &s;een her a long time.</Q></P>
<P>"Then &s;he does not board with you now," &s;aid Sir Charles, with a countenance as pale as death, dreading to hear &s;omething &s;till more fatal.</P>
<P>As Mr. Law&s;on was going to an&s;wer him, Wil|liam, not knowing his father-in-law had company, entered the room abruptly; but &s;eeing the baronet, he bowed, apologized for his intru&s;ion, and in|&s;tantly retired.</P>
<P>The various emotions with which this &s;udden and unexpected &s;ight of his rival filled the brea&s;t of Sir Charles, cau&s;ed &s;uch a wildne&s;s in his looks, that Mr. Law&s;on, in great a&s;toni&s;hment and perplexity, asked him if he was taken ill?</P>
<P>Sir Charles, endeavouring to compo&s;e him&s;elf, replied, "That he was very well, but in a faultering accent asked, who the young gentleman was that had ju&s;t left the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on told him he was his &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P><PB N="809" REF="415">
<Q>Your &s;on-in-law! cried Sir Charles, eagerly, what! married to your daughter! is it po&s;&s;ible?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Law&s;on knew enough of Sophia's &s;tory to make him comprehend now who this young gen|tleman was, who di&s;covered &s;o extraordinary a con|cern upon this occa&s;ion; and, charmed to have an opportunity of doing her &s;ervice by removing tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which he had been told had produced &s;o fatal a rever&s;e in her fortune, he gave the baro|net a circum&s;tantial account of his daughter's mar|riage: &s;en&s;ible that he was too much intere&s;ted in this detail to make him think it impertinent, he introduced it no otherways than by declaring him|&s;elf under the greate&s;t obligation to mi&s;s Sophia, who, having honoured his daughter with her friend|&s;hip, had been the chief in&s;trument of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>While the good curate related all the circum|&s;tances of an affair which had had &s;uch melancholy con&s;equences, the baronet li&s;tened to him with an attention &s;till as the grave; his eyes were fixed upon his with a look of the mo&s;t eager anxiety, and he &s;carce &s;uffered him&s;elf to breathe for fear of lo&s;ing any of his words.</P>
<P>In proportion as his doubts were removed, his countenance expre&s;&s;ed more and more joy; and when, upon his reflecting on all that he had heard, it appeared plainly that the fatal meeting which had cau&s;ed him &s;o much angui&s;h, was the effect of Sophia's &s;olicitude to &s;erve her friend, and that the pa&s;&s;ionate action of the youth was an acknow|ledgment of gratitude, not an expre&s;&s;ion of love, he was not able to conceal the exce&s;s of his joy,
<PB N="810" REF="416">
but, ri&s;ing up in a &s;udden tran&s;port, he took the curate's hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it eagerly,
<Q>You know not, &s;aid he, Mr. Law&s;on, how happy you have made me; but where is mi&s;s Sophia, is &s;he gone to Bath with her good friend Mr. Herbert?</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, Sir, replied Mr. Law&s;on; &s;he lives with her mother. You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that Mrs. Darnley has lo&s;t her annuity by the death of the gentleman upon whom it was charged.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I never heard it till now, &s;aid the baronet, who&s;e tenderne&s;s was alarmed for his Sophia; tell me I beg you what is her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her elde&s;t daughter has left her, &s;aid Mr. Law&s;on, and &s;he has retired with mi&s;s Sophia to a village about five miles from hence, in the road to London, where that excellent young lady &s;upports her mother and her&s;elf by the la|bour of her hands.</Q></P>
<P>"Angelick creature!" exclaimed Sir Charles, with his eyes &s;wimming in tears. Then, after a little pau&s;e, he de&s;ired a direction to the place where Mrs. Darnley lived, and took a kind leave of Mr. Law&s;on, telling him he hoped &s;oon to vi&s;it him again.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, although he galloped as fa&s;t as it was po&s;&s;ible, found his hor&s;e went too &s;low for his impatience; &s;o eager was he to &s;ee Sophia, and gain her pardon for the unrea&s;onable conduct which his jealou&s;y and rage had made him guilty of.</P>
<P>The account Mr. Law&s;on had given him of the part &s;he had taken in his daughter's marriage with the youth whom he had con&s;idered as his rival, not
<PB N="811" REF="417">
only removed the torturing pangs of jealou&s;y, which he had &s;o long felt, but made him view &s;e|veral circum&s;tances in Sophia's behaviour in a light favourable to his own ardent wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He fondly fancied that the melancholy in which he had heard &s;he was plunged, was occa&s;ioned by a tender remembrance of him; and that the hope of &s;till being his, might have been the chief cau&s;e of her rejecting the addre&s;&s;es of Mr. Howard.</P>
<P>How different were the&s;e ideas from the gloomy ones which had hitherto perplexed his mind! he &s;eemed like a man waked from a frightful dream of de&s;pair and death, to a certainty of life and joy.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e tran&s;porting reveries he had pa&s;|&s;ed by Sophia's hou&s;e, without perceiving it to be the &s;ame he had been directed to; and when he had reached the end of the village, he looked about for it in vain, and &s;aw no one of whom he could enquire for it but an old woman, who was &s;itting under a tree near the road, making up a no&s;egay of &s;ome flowers, &s;uch as the late &s;ea&s;on produced.</P>
<P>He &s;topped his hor&s;e, and asked her if &s;he knew where Mrs. Darnley lived? At the mention of that name &s;he ro&s;e as ha&s;tily as her feeblene&s;s would permit her, and told him, &s;he knew the hou&s;e very well; and, if he plea&s;ed, would go and &s;hew it him.
<Q>I am making this no&s;egay for the &s;weet young gentlewoman her daugh|ter, &s;aid the old woman; I carry her flowers every day; heaven ble&s;s her, &s;he is my only &s;up|port.
<PB N="812" REF="418">
There is a great many fine folks here|abouts, from whom I could never get any re|lief; but &s;ince &s;he came hither I have wanted for nothing. Pray let me &s;hew you her hou&s;e; old and weak as I am, I would walk ten miles to do her &s;ervice.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, alighting from his hor&s;e, ordered his &s;ervant to lead it to the neare&s;t public hou&s;e, and wait for him there; he told the old woman, he would accept of her offer, and walk along with her. Then taking two guineas out of his pocket, he gave them to her, in reward, he &s;aid, for the gra|titude &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for her young benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>The good woman received his bounty with a tran&s;|port of &s;urpri&s;e and joy, and plea&s;ingly repaid him by talking of his beloved Sophia; of whom &s;he re|lated many in&s;tances of tenderne&s;s and charity to|wards the poor of the village, and filled him with admiration of that true benevolence, which, even in the mid&s;t of indigence, could admini&s;ter to the greater wants of her fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>When they came within &s;ight of Sophia's little cottage, the old woman, pointing to it, told him, Mrs. Darnley and her daughter lived there: upon which the baronet, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her, walked up to it with di&s;ordered ha&s;te. A row of wooden pales led to a &s;mall gra&s;s-plat before the door.</P>
<P>As he approached, he &s;aw Sophia &s;itting at a window at work. He &s;topped to gaze upon her; &s;he appeared to him more lovely, more engaging than ever. He wi&s;hed, yet dreaded her looking up, le&s;t her fir&s;t thoughts upon &s;eeing him being
<PB N="813" REF="419">
unfavourable, &s;he &s;hould re&s;olve to refu&s;e his vi|&s;it. He went forwards with a beating heart, and cautiou&s;ly opening the little gate, reached the door of this humble habitation unheard and un|&s;een by Sophia; the door flew open at his touch, poverty has no need of bolts and bars, and every good angel is the guard of innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e he made in entering, and the &s;ound of her name, pronounced in a tender accent, made Sophia ha&s;tily turn her head. At &s;ight of Sir Charles, &s;he &s;tarted from her chair, her work fell from her trembling hands, &s;he looked at him in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, unable, and perhaps unwilling to avoid him.</P>
<P>The baronet, who&s;e heart laboured with the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of tenderne&s;s, anxiety, hope, and fear, had not power to utter a word; and while her &s;urpri&s;e kept her motionle&s;s, threw him&s;elf at her feet, and taking one of her hands, pre&s;&s;ed it re&s;pectfully to his lips, tears at the &s;ame time falling from his eyes.</P>
<P>Sophia, who&s;e gentle mind was &s;en&s;ibly affected with this action, and the palene&s;s and langour which appeared in his countenance, found it im|po&s;&s;ible to treat him with that &s;everity which his capricious conduct &s;eemed to demand of her; ne|verthele&s;s &s;he drew away her hand, which he yielded with reluctant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I hoped," &s;aid &s;he, in an accent that expre&s;&s;ed more &s;oftne&s;s and grief than anger or di&s;dain,
<Q>that I &s;hould be &s;pared any farther in&s;ults of this &s;ort from you; tho&s;e I have already &s;uf|fered
<PB N="814" REF="420">
has &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed me for my weak credulity.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, when &s;he began to &s;peak, ro&s;e up; but continued gazing on her with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate tenderne&s;s, while every word &s;he uttered &s;eemed to pierce his heart.</P>
<P><Q>I will not, pur&s;ued Sophia, gathering firm|ne&s;s as &s;he &s;poke, ask you, why you have in|truded upon me thus unexpectedly? or why you a&s;&s;ume a behaviour &s;o little of a-piece with your pa&s;t actions? I only beg you to believe, that I am not again to be deceived; and although I am per&s;uaded my good opinion is of no con&s;e|quence to you, yet I will tell you, that if it is po&s;|&s;ible to regain it, it will be by never more impor|tuning me with vi&s;its, which my &s;ituation in life makes it very improper for me to admit of.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, when &s;he had &s;aid this, went out of the room, without ca&s;ting a look back upon Sir Charles, who followed her in great di&s;order, con|juring her only to hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>As &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing to her own chamber, &s;he was met by her mother, who, &s;eeing Sir Charles, was filled with &s;urprize and joy; and perceiving that Sophia was avoiding him, &s;aid to her with an an|gry accent,
<Q>Where are you going? what is the meaning of this rudene&s;s?</Q></P>
<P>Sophia, without an&s;wering her, retired to her own room, not without great perturbation of mind; for there was &s;omething in the baronet's looks and words that &s;eemed to merit a hearing at lea&s;t; but &s;he dreaded the weakne&s;s of her own heart,
<PB N="815" REF="421">
and was fully per&s;uaded that any conde&s;cen&s;ion on her &s;ide would give him too great an advantage over her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley, finding her endeavours to retain her were fruitle&s;s, advanced towards Sir Charles with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, congratulated him up|on his return, and thanked him for the honour he did her in vi&s;iting her in her poor little habita|tion.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aluted her re&s;pectfully, and took a &s;eat.
<Q>There is a &s;ad alteration, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, in my poor affairs &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t. I never thought to have received you in &s;uch a hovel. You have heard, I &s;uppo&s;e, of my misfor|tune.</Q></P>
<P>Sir Charles, who was in great confu&s;ion of thought, and had &s;carce heard a word &s;he &s;aid, replied carele&s;sly,
<Q>Yes, madam, I am &s;orry for it.</Q></P>
<P>The coldne&s;s of this an&s;wer ca&s;t a damp upon tho&s;e hopes which &s;he had eagerly admitted upon &s;eeing him again; and, impatient to be relieved from her tormenting anxiety on account of this unexpected vi&s;it, &s;he asked him abruptly, whether &s;he might wi&s;h him joy, for &s;he heard, &s;he &s;aid, that he was going to be married.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, rouzed by this que&s;tion, replied ha|&s;tily,
<Q>Who could have told you any thing &s;o un|likely? Married! no, madam, there never was any foundation for &s;uch a report.</Q></P>
<P>"Indeed I believe &s;o," &s;aid Mrs. Darnley, al|mo&s;t breathle&s;s with joy to find him deny it
<PB N="816" REF="422">
&s;o earne&s;tly.
<Q>To be &s;ure people are very envi|ous and ill-natured, and tho&s;e who told me, no doubt, de&s;igned to do you an ill office.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And they have &s;ucceeded, &s;aid Sir Charles, &s;ighing, if they have been able to per&s;uade mi&s;s Sophia, that after having a&s;pired to the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of her, I could de&s;cend to love any other woman. I came to implore her pardon, ma|dam, pur&s;ued he, for all the extravagancies of my pa&s;t conduct, and for that unrea&s;onable jea|lou&s;y which was the &s;ource of them, could I have been &s;o happy to have prevailed upon her to have heard me.</Q></P>
<P>"What!" interrupted Mrs. Darnley eagerly,
<Q>and was my daughter &s;o rude as to leave you without hearing what you had to &s;ay, I prote&s;t I am a&s;hamed of her behaviour; but I hope you will be &s;o good to excu&s;e it, Sir; I will in&s;i&s;t upon her coming in again.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No, madam, &s;aid Sir Charles, holding her, for &s;he was hurrying away, mi&s;s Sophia mu&s;t not be con&s;trained: I cannot bear that.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley unwillingly re&s;umed her &s;eat, and inly fretting at her daughter's ob&s;tinacy, tremb|led for the event of this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes, &s;ud|denly ro&s;e up, and took his leave. Mrs. Darnley, in great anxiety, followed him to the door, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped to &s;ee him again. He an&s;wered only by a low bow, and walked away full of doubt and perplexity.</P>
<P><PB N="817" REF="423">Sophia's &s;teadine&s;s in refu&s;ing to hear him, bani&s;hed all tho&s;e flattering ideas of her tender|ne&s;s for him, which he had &s;o eagerly admitted; for he concluded that if her heart had not been &s;teeled by indifference, &s;he would, notwith&s;tand|ing her ju&s;t rea&s;ons for re&s;entment, have been re|joiced to give him an opportunity of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He had reached the hou&s;e where his &s;ervant was attending with the hor&s;es, without having de|termined what to do. To return to town without &s;eeing Sophia again, and being a&s;&s;ured of a recon|ciliation, was mi&s;ery which he could not &s;upport; and he dreaded making a new attempt to &s;ee her, le&s;t he &s;hould receive more proofs of her in&s;en&s;ibi|lity and di&s;dain.</P>
<P>In this perplexity the &s;ight of Mr. Herbert alight|ing from a &s;tage-coach, was a relief as great as it was unexpected; and in the &s;udden joy he felt at meeting with a man who&s;e interpo&s;ition could be &s;o u&s;eful to him, he forgot that his former beha|viour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have given ri&s;e to &s;trong prejudices again&s;t him, and ran up to embrace the good old man with extreme cordiality.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert was &s;urpri&s;ed, and repaid his civi|lities with great coldne&s;s: upon which the young baronet, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, de&s;ired to have a few moments conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>They walked together down a meadow; and Sir Charles, having with a candor and &s;incerity be|coming the rectitude of his intentions, related all tho&s;e circum&s;tances which had concurred to excite
<PB N="818" REF="424">
his jealou&s;y, and with that powerful eloquence which pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pires, expatiated upon the motives of his conduct, a conduct which he acknowledged laid him open to the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;u&s;picions; Mr. Herbert, convinced of his &s;incerity, and full of compa&s;&s;ion for the torments which his mi&s;taken jealou&s;y had cau&s;ed him, undertook to make his peace with Sophia, and a&s;&s;ured him he would very &s;hortly wait upon him in town.</P>
<P>This would not &s;atisfy the anxious lover; he declared he would not leave the place till he was a&s;&s;ured of his pardon; and Mr. Herbert, who cer|tainly was not di&s;plea&s;ed with his ob&s;tinacy, could with difficulty per&s;uade him to wait only till the next day for an account of his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir Charles unwillingly took the road to Lon|don, and Mr. Herbert ha&s;tened to congratulate his beloved charge upon the agreeable pro&s;pect that was once more opening for her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley had, during this interval, been employed in reproaching poor Sophia for her be|haviour to Sir Charles. In the vexation of her heart &s;he exclaimed in the &s;evere&s;t terms again&s;t her pride and ob&s;tinacy; &s;he told her, &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured Sir Charles would never attempt to &s;ee her again; that it was plain he was di&s;gu&s;ted with her bad temper.</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears while &s;he enu|merated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune, which, &s;he &s;aid, Sophia had thrown from her; and among many motives which &s;he urged ought to have determined her to act otherwi&s;e,
<PB N="819" REF="425">
that of being able to out-&s;hine her &s;i&s;ter was one.</P>
<P>Sophia an&s;wered only by &s;ighs: &s;he her&s;elf was not ab&s;olutely &s;atisfied with the unrelenting &s;e|verity with which &s;he had treated Sir Charles. The more &s;he reflected upon his behaviour, the more &s;he condemned her&s;elf for not hearing what he had to offer in his own defence. She had once thought it probable that he had been deceived by the report that was &s;pread through Mrs. Gib|bons's folly of her encouraging the addre&s;&s;es of her nephew, and his extravagant conduct might be occa&s;ioned by jealou&s;y: a fault which a woman is always di&s;po&s;ed to pardon in a lover. While &s;he revolved the&s;e thoughts in her mind, Mrs. Darnley perceived her unea&s;ine&s;s, and added to it by new reproaches.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert's arrival put an end to this tor|menting &s;cene. Sophia fir&s;t heard his voice, and flew to receive him; Mrs. Darnley followed, and &s;eeing her bathed in tears, while the good old man &s;aluted her with the tenderne&s;s of a parent, &s;he told him, with an air half &s;erious, half gay, that her daughter loved him &s;o well, &s;he had no ten|derne&s;s for any one el&s;e. She then entered abrubt|ly upon the affair of Sir Charles, though &s;he hardly expected Mr. Herbert would join with her in con|demning Sophia.</P>
<P>He plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed her by &s;aying, that So|phia was to blame; and that he came prepared to chide her for her petulance and ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P><PB N="820" REF="426">Mr. Herbert, who &s;aw a &s;weet impatience in Sophia's looks, explained him&s;elf immediately, and told her he had met Sir Charles; who had fully removed all the &s;u&s;picions his &s;trange conduct had occa&s;ioned, and convinced him, that he de|&s;erved more pity than cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><Q>No doubt, pur&s;ued he, looking on Sophia with a &s;mile, you will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear, young lady, that Sir Charles was witne&s;s to the interview you had in the meadow behind Mr. Law&s;on's hou&s;e, with a certain hand&s;ome youth, whom he had heard was his rival, and a favour|ed rival too. What were his thoughts, do you imagine, when he &s;aw this hand&s;ome youth throw him&s;elf at your feet, and ki&s;s your hand?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley now looked at her daughter in great a&s;toni&s;hment; and Sophia, who yet did not recollect the circum&s;tance of her meeting William, was &s;o perplexed, &s;he knew not what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert enjoyed her innocent confu&s;ion for a few moments, and then repeated all that Sir Charles had told him, of his jealou&s;y and rage; his vain attempts to bani&s;h her from his remembrance; the re&s;olution he had formed after his conver&s;ation with Mr. Howard concerning her; and how hap|pily he had been undeceived at Mr. Law&s;on's, where he found his &s;uppo&s;ed rival was the hu&s;band of her friend.</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Mrs. Darnley, with great vehemence,
<Q>I hope you are &s;atisfied now, So|phia: I hope you will treat Sir Charles with more civility if he comes again.&mdash;Mr. Herbert,
<PB N="821" REF="427">
I beg you will exert your power over her upon this occa&s;ion &mdash;I think there is no doubt of Sir Charles's honourable intentions.</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;he ran on, while Sophia, who had li&s;tened to Mr. Herbert's relation with the &s;ofte&s;t emotions of pity, tenderne&s;s, and joy, continued &s;ilent with her eyes fixed upon the ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, willing to &s;pare her delicacy, told Mrs. Darnley, that relying upon&mdash;Sophia's good &s;en&s;e and prudence, he had ventured to a&s;&s;ure Sir Charles of a more favourable reception, when her prejudices were removed.</P>
<P><Q>He will come to-morrow, my child, pur&s;ued he, to implore your pardon for all the errors of his pa&s;t conduct, and to offer you his hand. I am per&s;uaded you will act properly upon this occa&s;ion; and in a marriage &s;o far beyond your hopes and expectations, acknowledge the hand of Providence, which thinks fit to reward you, even in this world, for your &s;teady adherence to virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia bowed and blu&s;hed; her mother, in a rapture, embraced and wi&s;hed her joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert now endeavoured to change the conver&s;ation to &s;ubjects more indifferent; but Mrs. Darnley, ever thoughtle&s;s and un&s;ea&s;onable, could talk of nothing but Sir Charles, and the gran|deur which awaited her daughter. All night her fancy ran upon gilt equipages, rich jewels, magnificent hou&s;es, and a train of &s;ervants; and &s;he was by much too happy to ta&s;te any repo&s;e: but Sophia enjoyed the change of her fortune with much more ra|tional
<PB N="822" REF="428">
delight, and among all the &s;entiments that aro&s;e in her mind upon this occa&s;ion, that of gra|titude to heaven was the mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t lively.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who had accepted a lodging in Sophia's cottage, went to Sir Charles the next day, according to his promi&s;e. He found him waiting for him full of anxious impatience; and hearing from the good old man, that Sophia was di&s;po&s;ed to receive him favourably, he embraced him in a tran&s;port of joy; and his chariot being already or|dered, they drove immediately to the village.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley welcomed the baronet with a pro|fu&s;ion of civilities. Sophia's behaviour was full of dignity and &s;oft re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, after a long conver&s;ation with her, obtained her leave to demand her of her mother, to whom he &s;hewed the writings, which were al|ready all drawn; and by which Sophia had a jointure and pin-money, equal to the &s;ettlements that had been made upon lady Stanley.</P>
<P>He now ventured to intreat that a &s;hort day might be fixed for their marriage. It was with great difficulty, that Sophia was prevailed upon to con&s;ent; but her mother's impetuo&s;ity carri|ed all before it, and Mr. Herbert him&s;elf &s;up|ported the young baronet's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The ceremony was performed by Mr. Law&s;on in his own pari&s;h-church: after which he and his amiable family accompanied the new wedded pair to their country-&s;eat, where they pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days with them.</P>
<P><PB N="823" REF="429">Mr. Herbert having previou&s;ly acquainted Sir Charles with Harriot's &s;ituation, the baronet, tho' he dete&s;ted her character, and declared he never could pardon her for the mi&s;eries &s;he had cau&s;ed him; yet was de&s;irous to have her decently &s;et|tled, and promi&s;ed to give a thou&s;and pounds with her in marriage, if a reputable match could be found for her: he even put notes for that &s;um into Mr. Herbert's hands, and earne&s;tly recom|mended it to him, to take the affair under his ma|nagement.</P>
<P>Harriot, during the time &s;he lived with her mo|ther, had been courted by a young trade&s;man in tolerable circum&s;tances; and although &s;he thought it great in&s;olence for a per&s;on in bu&s;ine&s;s to pre|tend to her, yet, actuated by a true &s;pirit of coque|try, while &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed the lover, &s;he took plea&s;ure in his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This young man &s;till retained &s;ome tenderne&s;s for her, and, allured by the pro&s;pect of a fortune, was willing, notwith&s;tanding any faults in her con|duct, to make her his wife.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley propo&s;ed him to her, and Mr. Herbert enforced her advice with all the good &s;en&s;e he was matter of. But Harriot received the propo&s;al with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain; in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he was married as well as her &s;i&s;ter; that her rank in life was &s;uperior to hers; and added, by way of threat, that her appearance &s;hould be &s;o likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The extraordinary efforts &s;he made to &s;upport this boa&s;t, engaged lord L. in expences that en|tirely alienated his affections from her, di&s;gu&s;ted
<PB N="824" REF="430">
as he long had been, with her in&s;olence and folly.</P>
<P>His relations concluded a match for him with a young lady of &s;uitable rank and fortune; and, after making a &s;mall &s;ettlement on Harriot, he took leave of her for ever.</P>
<P>The vexation &s;he felt from this incident, threw her into a di&s;temper very fatal to beauty. The yellow jaundice made &s;uch ravage in her face, that &s;carce any of tho&s;e charms on which &s;he had valued her&s;elf &s;o much, remained. All her anx|ious hours were now employed in repairing her complexion, and in vain endeavours to re&s;tore lu&s;tre to tho&s;e eyes, &s;unk in hollowne&s;s, and tinctured with the hue of her di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Although thus altered, the report of the fortune &s;he was likely to have made her be thought a prize worthy the ambition of a young officer, who had quitted the bu&s;ine&s;s of a peruke maker, in which he was bred, for an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, which made him a gentleman at once.</P>
<P>He offered him&s;elf to Harriot with that a&s;&s;u|rance of &s;ucce&s;s, which the gaiety of his appear|ance, and his title of captain, gave him rea&s;on to expect, with a lady of her turn of mind.</P>
<P>Harriot, charmed with &s;o important a conque&s;t, &s;oon con&s;ented to give him her hand; and Sir Charles Stanley, finding his character not excep|tionable, gave her the fortune he had promi&s;ed, to which Sophia generou&s;ly added a thou&s;and pounds more. The baronet procured her husband a bet|ter commi&s;&s;ion; but de&s;ignedly in one of the
<PB N="825" REF="431">
colonies, whither he in&s;i&s;ted upon his wife's ac|companying him.</P>
<P>Harriot, in de&s;pair at being obliged to quit the delights of London, &s;oon began to hate her hu&s;|band heartily; and he, entering into her di&s;po|&s;ition and character, lo&s;t all e&s;teem and ten|derne&s;s for her. Her behaviour ju&s;tified the ri|gid confinement he kept her in; and while &s;he &s;uffered all the re&s;traint of jealou&s;y, &s;he was at the &s;ame time mortified with the knowledge that pride and not love was the &s;ource of it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Darnley lived not long after the departure of her favourite daughter; for &s;o Harriot always continued to be.</P>
<P>Sophia attended her mother during her long illne&s;s with the mo&s;t duteous care, and had the &s;atisfaction to be a&s;&s;ured by Mr. Law&s;on, who a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her in her preparations for death, that her at|tachment to the world, which the affluent circum|&s;tances to which &s;he was rai&s;ed but too much in|crea&s;ed, had at length given way to more pious &s;entiments; and &s;he died with the re&s;ignation of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The ill conduct of her &s;i&s;ter, and the death of her mother, proved at fir&s;t &s;ome interruption to Sophia's happine&s;s; but the&s;e dome&s;tic &s;torms blown over, &s;he began to ta&s;te the good fortune which heaven had be&s;towed on her: her chief en|joyment of it was to &s;hare it with others; and Sir Charles, who adored her, put it amply in her power to indulge the benevolence of her di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="826" REF="432">He took upon him&s;elf the care of rewarding her friends; he pre&s;ented Mr. Law&s;on to a very con|&s;iderable living: he procured Dolly's hu&s;band a genteel and lucrative employment; and married her younger &s;i&s;ter to a relation of his own.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert, who was above receiving any other gratification from Sir Charles than the entire friend|&s;hip which he ever pre&s;erved for him, had the &s;a|tisfaction to &s;pend mo&s;t of his time with his be|loved daughter, as he u&s;ed tenderly to call Sophia, and to behold her as happy as the condition of mor|tality admits of.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's tenderne&s;s for her &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e every day; and when Mr. Herbert once took occa&s;ion to compliment him upon the delicacy, the ardor, and the con&s;tancy of his affection, he replied with a &s;mile,
<Q>You attribute to me a virtue, which, in this ca&s;e, I cannot be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s; had my pa&s;&s;ion for my Sophia been founded only on the charms of her per&s;on, I might probably e'er now have become a mere fa&s;hionable hu&s;band; but her virtue and wit &s;upply her with graces ever varied, and ever new. Thus the &s;teadine&s;s of my affection for her is but a con&s;tant incon&s;tancy, which at|taches me &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to one or other of tho&s;e &s;hining qualities, of which her charming mind is an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Sir ANTHONY VANDYCK CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P>HE drew the marquis Giulio Brignole, a fa|mous poet, on hor&s;e-back: he drew al&s;o the picture of the marchione&s;s his wife, in which he &s;eemed to oblige nature it&s;elf; for by eterni&s;ing that beauty, he gave an in&s;tance to all po&s;terity of what &s;he had been able to perform.</P>
<P>He drew the picture of the doge Palavicino, in his habit of amba&s;&s;ador to the pope, and George Paulo Balbi, on hor&s;e-back, which was a mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite picture; but becau&s;e of his con&s;piracy his face was blotted out, being a traitor to his coun|try; and that of Franci&s;co Maria, of the &s;ame family, made in the place. There is al&s;o in this per&s;on's hou&s;e, of the hand of Vandyck, the pic|ture of an old man in white armour: his right hand holds a general's &s;taff, and his left the pom|mel of his &s;word; and is in picture as great a &s;ol|dier as the marquis Spinola was in effect, and is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be intended for him.</P>
<P><PB N="828" REF="434">The queen of Sweden has in Rome, al&s;o of the hand of Vandyck, the picture of a boy of the fa|mily of the Imperiali, which appears &s;o much alive that no body would judge it but to be really &s;o.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e pictures of particular per&s;ons, he made &s;ome hi&s;tories: among&s;t which there is a cru|cifix, with St. Francis, and our Saviour, together with the patron of the picture at prayers. Vandyck had now a great mind to go into Sicily. Prince Filibert of Savoy being viceroy he drew his pic|ture: but the plague happening about this time, and the death of the prince, to whom cardinal Doria &s;ucceeded, Vandyck likewi&s;e having received &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter in Palermo, retired in great ha&s;te to his home of Genoa, carrying with him the cloth for a picture for the oratory of the &s;ociety of the ro&s;ary; in which he repre&s;ented the Virgin encom|pa&s;&s;ed with the glory of angels, that pre&s;ent her each with a crown. At the bottom is St. Domi|nic, with the five virgin &s;aints of Palermo, among&s;t which are St. Katherine and St. Ro&s;ary, and a child that holds his hand to his no&s;e, becau&s;e of the &s;tench that comes from a dead head that lies upon the ground; by which he de&s;igns to expre&s;s the plague from which the city was delivered by the interce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;aints.</P>
<P>This picture being fini&s;hed, and &s;ent to Paler|mo, he betook him&s;elf again to the drawing of faces; by which having got a good &s;um of mo|ney, he returned to his own town of Antwerp, ex|tolled by all, and welcomed by his friends, after
<PB N="829" REF="435">
the ab&s;ence of &s;ome years. He employed him&s;elf here mo&s;tly in drawing faces; yet he likewi&s;e painted &s;ome hi&s;tory pieces, which are di&s;per&s;ed through all Flanders and many other places; of which we &s;hall collect &s;ome few, there being al|ready &s;ome that are made public by the engraver. Among&s;t the fir&s;t of them that was &s;een at Ant|werp, was the marriage of St. Jo&s;eph in St. Mi|chael's church, where the &s;aint kneels before the Virgin, whil&s;t &s;he gives him her right hand, which is propo&s;ed to him by an angel. For the nuns of Begginage he drew a piet&agrave;, that is, our Saviour dead in the lap of his mother, and Magdalen kneeling ki&s;&s;ing the wound of his hand, with a St. John. For the Magdalen he drew his &s;i&s;ter's face, who was then a nun, to whom he made a pre&s;ent of the picture. He drew al&s;o another pi|et&agrave; for St. Francis's church, which is as much e&s;teemed as any thing he did. He drew our Sa|viour extended on a winding-&s;heet, with his head on his mother's bo&s;om, who, opening her arms, lifts up her eyes to heaven: behind &s;tands St. John, that takes one of the arms of our Saviour, and &s;hews the wound to two angels who are la|menting at his feet.</P>
<P>The&s;e three la&s;t figures are in half-&s;hadow, which gives great force to the naked figure of our Savi|our, upon whom he makes the principal light fall. To the &s;ame &s;i&s;ter, Su&s;anna Vandyck, he dedicated the engraven de&s;ign of another picture in St. Au|&s;tin's, which is very remarkable for liveline&s;s of colour, and variety of invention. The &s;aint being in
<PB N="830" REF="436">
an extacy, is &s;u&s;tained by two angels. On one hand of him &s;tands St. Monaca, and on the other a &s;aint of his order, and to St. Au&s;tin in this rapture the divinity is revealed from above, one of the an|gels pointing up to our Saviour, who&s;e arms are &s;pread ready to embrace him; and at his feet &s;eve|ral little angels with divers &s;ymbols, as, one of them holds a &s;ceptre with the eye of Providence upon it: another a branch of olive, the &s;ymbol of peace; a third lifts up a &s;nake with his tail in his mouth, the emblem of eternity; a fourth oppo&s;es him&s;elf to a flaming &s;word; a fifth looks the &s;on of ju&s;tice in the face; together with &s;everal other my&s;teries &s;ymbolically expre&s;&s;ed; and above all a triangle to expre&s;s the trinity, with the name written in Hebrew characters.</P>
<P>For the &s;i&s;ters of St. Dominic he painted a cru|cifix, the &s;aint on one &s;ide, and St. Catherine of Siena on the other; and another crucifix in Ghent, with a Magdalen that embraces the cro&s;s and St. John. Behind is a man armed on hor&s;eback, that gives orders to one of the crucifiers to reach the &s;punge to our Saviour, adored and lamented by the angels. In Malines in St. Francis's church are three other pieces of his hand: our Saviour upon the cro&s;s over the high altar, and over two other altars St. Bonaventure &s;aying ma&s;s, and the miracle of St. Anthony of Padua, when the hor&s;e kneeled before the ho&s;t.</P>
<P>As for drawing of faces, in which Vandyck &s;eemed more e&s;pecially to excel, whil&s;t he conti|nued in Bru&s;&s;els he drew almo&s;t all the nobility in
<PB N="831" REF="437">
Flanders, having ju&s;tly acquired greater reputa|tion than any painter &s;ince the death of Titian. Indeed he gave his pictures a certain air and grace in the po&s;ture: &s;uch perhaps as was admired in Apelles when he had drawn Alexander and Anti|gonus.</P>
<P>He drew the infanta at length, and Mary of Medici, the queen-mother, &s;itting, and the duke of Orleans, her &s;on, at the time they fled into Flanders. Of his hand are al&s;o the pictures of the cardinal infant; of prince Thomas of Savoy in armour on hor&s;eback, and many other great per|&s;onages.</P>
<P>In the town-hou&s;e of the &s;ame city he drew af|ter the life the magi&s;trates of that place &s;itting in judgment: and this is looked upon as one of his be&s;t pieces, being compo&s;ed with great judgment, and accurately fini&s;hed. He drew for the prince of Orange a &s;tory out of Pa&s;tor Fido; who bought, al&s;o of his hand, the Virgin, with the child Je&s;us, before whom little angels are dancing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This picture is at pre&s;ent in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ford at Horton.</NOTE>. Many other of his pictures, both &s;to|ries and faces, may be &s;een at Antwerp in Van Ham's hou&s;e, as al&s;o in that of Diego Vueerdt's; who, among&s;t the re&s;t, has al&s;o tho&s;e of king Charles the fir&s;t, and his queen, drawn at the time Vandyck pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the court of England.</P>
<P>In this abundance of employment and fame, having, as it were, filled all Flanders with his re|nown,
<PB N="832" REF="438">
he re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the king of England's favour, who then called him for his &s;ervice to London. In this prince's court Rubens had already been honourably entertained, the king being always a great lover of all &s;orts of ingeni|ous arts; and &s;o great a friend and rewarder of foreign ingenuity, that in all occurrences he not only countenanced, but preferred them. 'Twas &s;o that upon Rubens' departure, Vandyck &s;uc|ceeded to his favour, which quickly augmented his wealth; and therefore, as it were, nece&s;&s;arily confirmed him in his wonted o&s;tentation of beha|viour and &s;plendor of equipage.</P>
<P>He had, however, opportunity enough of re|imbur&s;ing his great expences by frequent vi&s;its that were made him by the nobility, who, in that, followed the example of the king, who went of|ten thither to &s;ee him paint, and took delight in his conver&s;ation. Vandyck &s;eemed to vie with the magnificence of Parra&s;in, by keeping of &s;ervants, coaches, hor&s;es, mu&s;icians, and buffoons, with which he entertained &s;uch per&s;ons as came daily to him to be drawn, who were al&s;o invited to his ta|ble, where he &s;pent no le&s;s than eight or ten pounds a day.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;uch as are already mentioned, he kept men and women for models to paint by; for his manner was, as &s;oon as the face was done, to fi|ni&s;h the re&s;t by the help of the&s;e models, placed in this or that po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The king was plea&s;ed many times to be drawn by him; &s;o that Cavaliere Bernini at Rome being
<PB N="833" REF="439">
ordered to make a marble bu&s;t of his maje&s;ty, he was drawn on one cloth in three different views; the one with a whole face, the other two in pro|file and half profile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This picture is &s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family of Bernini at Rome.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He drew the king and queen in half length, holding a &s;prig of myrtle between them, and an|other of them with the young princes. He drew al&s;o the king on hor&s;eback, attended by a per&s;on that bears his helmet after him <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the gallery at Ken&s;ington.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He drew general Goring in a po&s;ture of haran|guing; and the lord Newport, ma&s;ter of the ordnance, giving orders to his officers. He drew the lord Arundel and his lady (who being a great lover of painting, was the means of Vandyck's be|ing introduced to the king's favour, and had been a great in&s;trument of his coming into England), which piece he fini&s;hed to &s;uch perfection, as if he was re&s;olved to &s;hew his art and gratitude toge|ther. Of his hand al&s;o is that of the dutche&s;s of Buckingham, with her daughters; who in token of the memory of her husband, holds his picture, in little, in her hand.</P>
<P>He drew the dutche&s;s of Southampton like the godde&s;s of Fortune, &s;itting upon the globe <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of lord Roy&s;ton.</NOTE>; and Sir Kenelme Digby, with his wife, &s;itting in two chairs, with their children by them; who being a great virtuo&s;o him&s;elf, Vandyck, as it were by a
<PB N="834" REF="440">
certain mutual con&s;ent of genius, did more e&s;pe|cially confide in him. He drew him in &s;everal manners; &s;ometimes in his armour, and &s;ometimes in the habit of a philo&s;opher. In one of the lat|ter there is repre&s;ented a broken &s;phere, the motto out of Horace, <HI>Si fractus illabatur orbis intrepi|dum ferient ruinae;</HI> which picture is one of the hundred that makes up the book of famous men, publi&s;hed by Vandyck, and printed at Antwerp, the be&s;t of which are done by him&s;elf with aqua fortis: among&s;t which you find al&s;o his own pic|ture. The &s;ame Sir Kenelme had a fancy to have his lady drawn in the form of Prudence, &s;itting in a white robe, with a coloured veil, and belt of jewels. One hand &s;he reaches to two white doves, and the other holds a &s;erpent: &s;he &s;ets her feet up|on a cube, to which are chained as &s;laves Deceit with her two faces, anger, envy, with &s;nakes about her head, and profane Love, blinded, his wings clipt, his bow broken, his arrows thrown away, and his torch extingui&s;hed, with other naked fi|gures according to the life. Above all this, is a glory of angels &s;inging and playing upon in&s;tru|ments, three of them holding between them a palm and garland over the head of Prudence, in token of victory and triumph over tho&s;e vices. The motto is taken out of Juvenal, <HI>Nullum nu|men abe&s;t &s;i &s;it Prudentia.</HI></P>
<P>Vandyck was &s;o plea&s;ed with this invention, that he copied it in little; but not fini&s;hed. Both the one and the other, during the troubles in Eng|land,
<PB N="835" REF="441">
land, were carried into France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The large one is now in the palace at Wind&s;or.</NOTE>. For Sir Kenelme Digby he drew al&s;o our Saviour taken from the cro&s;s, with Jo&s;eph and Nicodemus, who were anointing him before they laid him in the &s;epulchre. There is by them Magdalen and the Virgin falling in a &s;woon. And with this &s;everal other pieces of de|votion; as St. John Bapti&s;t in the wilderne&s;s; Magdalen tran&s;ported, and in an extacy at the harmony of the Angels; Judith, with Holofernes's head, in half figure; our Saviour upon the cro&s;s giving up the gho&s;t, which Sir Kenelme made a pre&s;ent of to the prince&s;s of Guimen&egrave;, when he was at Paris.</P>
<P>He drew for him al&s;o the picture of a brown woman in the habit of Pallas armed, and a plume in her helmet; a mo&s;t admirable head. For the earl of Northumberland he drew our Saviour upon the cro&s;s, with five angels, that in golden chalices catch the blood as it falls from the wounds; and under the cro&s;s are placed the Virgin, St. John, and Mary Magdalen.</P>
<P>He drew al&s;o for the king, be&s;ides heads and many other pictures, the dance of the Mu&s;es, with Apollo in the middle of Parna&s;&s;us; another Apol|lo flaying Mar&s;ias; a Bacchanal; and a dance of Amorets, that are &s;porting whil&s;t Venus &s;leeps with Adonis. And there being then in that court, among&s;t many other virtuo&s;i, Nicholas Lanier, a painter as well as mu&s;ician, he drew him in the form of David playing upon the harp before Saul.</P>
<P><PB N="836" REF="442">He drew al&s;o the dutche&s;s of Richmond, daugh|ter of the duke of Buckingham; which, by rea|&s;on of her incomparable beauty, is occa&s;ion of a doubt whether art or nature is capable of greater perfection; being drawn in the form of a Venus, which is waited upon by her &s;on duke Hamilton, naked, in the character of a Cupid, with his bow and arrow. He drew al&s;o the counte&s;s of Port|land, and the counte&s;s of Aubengey, in the habit of Nymphs. He drew al&s;o a lady in the character of a Venus, &s;tanding by a black.</P>
<P>For the queen he drew the Virgin, with the child Je&s;us and St. Jo&s;eph, that are looking upon cer|tain angels dancing upon the earth, whil&s;t others play to them upon &s;everal in&s;truments in the air; and this accompanied with a very plea&s;ant land|&s;cape. He drew al&s;o, in imitation of Tintorett, the crucifixion, with the crucifiers that are lifting up the cro&s;s; which is a work of great variety of figures.</P>
<P>The picture al&s;o of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin is very excellent. She is repre&s;ented holding up the in|fant Je&s;us, between two angels that play upon in|&s;truments. At his foot is the globe of the world. Nor mu&s;t we pa&s;s by the twelve apo&s;tles done by his hand, and Chri&s;t with the cro&s;s, all in half figure, and to be found among&s;t that great col|lection of Charles Bo&s;ch, bi&s;hop of Ghent, which are made public by the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e painted a picture of Samp&s;on break|ing his bonds; which was given by Van Woon&s;el
<PB N="837" REF="443">
to the archduke Leopold, governor of the Low Countries: a per&s;on that &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ed all his time in the &s;tudy of antiquity, medals, and painting, as we may &s;ee by what is already printed of his study <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed by Teniers, and commonly called Teniers's Gallery.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides the ordinary rewards of the king's munificence to Vandyck, his maje&s;ty conferred on him the honour of knighthood: but being now, becau&s;e of his indi&s;po&s;itions, which he had laboured under &s;ome years, de&s;irous to withdraw him&s;elf from the drudgery of portrait painting to &s;ome great work, by which his name might be tran&s;mitted with honour to po&s;terity, he took a journey to Paris, with an intent to procure to him&s;elf the painting of the gallery of the Lou|vre: but after having &s;tayed there two months without any &s;ucce&s;s, he returned to England, and propo&s;ed to the king, by means of Sir Kenelme Dig|by, to make de&s;igns for a &s;uit of hangings for the Banqueting-hou&s;e at Whitehall; the &s;ubjects of which were to be the ceremony of the crowning of the kings of England; the in&s;titution of the or|der of the garter by Edward the third; the pro|ce&s;&s;ion of the knights in their robes, and other functions civil and military. The king was ex|tremely well plea&s;ed with this de&s;ign; but thought his demand of eighty thou&s;and pounds <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In all the accounts that are written of Vandyck, this extraordinary &s;um is &s;aid to be demanded, which, con&s;ider|ing the different value of money, would be equal to what two hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds is at this time, it may be concluded that there is &s;ome mi&s;take: a cypher, per|haps, added too much.</NOTE> too ex|travagant:
<PB N="838" REF="444">
though it was believed the price would have been adju&s;ted, if Vandyck's death, which happened at this time, had not put a &s;top to all farther proceeding.</P>
<P>Vandyck, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t &s;ums of mo|ney he received, left very little at his death, having con&s;umed it all in that &s;plendid manner of living, which was rather like a prince than a painter. As to his per&s;on, he was of &s;mall &s;ta|ture, but well proportioned, and active; his fea|tures were regular, and his countenance agreea|ble. His hair was inclinable to red, which is com|mon to tho&s;e of his country.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary that his be&s;t pictures are tho&s;e he painted when very young, when he not much exceeded twenty years. He then u&s;ed, ac|cording to the practice of the Venetians, a great body of colour, which he afterwards changed for a &s;moother, in&s;ipid, but more expeditious manner; u&s;ing very little colour, which, after &s;ome time, flying off, left the light parts of the face too white, and the half &s;hadows too grey. This is the ge|neral fault of his portraits of women; and the por|traits of the men are very often dry and flat, and, in the painter's phra&s;e, &s;tarved of colour. To ba|lance tho&s;e faults, which are &s;ometimes found in his work, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other excellencies to the

<HEAD>The Vanity of Beauty and of Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing we ought &s;o much to guard again&s;t as vanity in young ladies. They come into the world with a vehement de&s;ire to plea&s;e: finding them&s;elves excluded from tho&s;e paths by which men arrive at authority and glo|ry, they endeavour to balance that lo&s;s by all the captivating qualities of wit and per&s;on. This gives ri&s;e to their &s;oft and in&s;inuating turn of con|ver&s;ation; thence it is that they &s;o earne&s;tly a&s;pire after beauty and every external grace, and are &s;o warmly intere&s;ted in dre&s;s. The fa&s;hion of a cap, the di&s;po&s;ition of a ribbon, the form of a curl in this place or that, the choice of a colour, are to them matters of importance. This exce&s;s is car|ried to a greater height among us than any other people; the changeblene&s;s of our fancy occa&s;ions a perpetual revolution of mode; &s;o that to the love of dre&s;s, that of novelty is &s;uperadded: an article that has &s;trange effects upon &s;uch minds.</P>
<P><PB N="841" REF="447">The&s;e two follies in confederacy overturn di&s;|tinction of rank, and introduce licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners. Void as we are of any regulations in dre&s;s or in furniture, there is nothing effectual left with regard to difference of conditions; for as to the tables of particulars, that is what public au|thority cannot ea&s;ily give rules to: every one pro|ceeds as he can afford; or rather, neglecting that con&s;ideration, as his ambition or his vanity prompts him.</P>
<P>It is this pride which often ruins whole fami|lies, and their ruin draws after it the corruption of manners. On one &s;ide per&s;ons of mean birth are &s;timulated to rai&s;e a ha&s;ty fortune: a thing not to be compa&s;&s;ed without &s;in, as the Holy Gho&s;t hath a&s;&s;ured us.&mdash;On the other, per&s;ons of quality, bereft of all re&s;ources, &s;toop to the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t wretched methods of &s;upporting their expence. The con&s;equence of which is, that, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, honour and hone&s;ty and natu|ral affection become extingui&s;hed even among the neare&s;t relations. Whence is all this evil but from the power which certain vain women have acquired of regulating fa&s;hions? Whoever thinks of continuing in the gravity and &s;implicity of our ancient manners, are by the&s;e pointed out to be laughed at as &s;o many antiques.</P>
<P>Apply your&s;elf then to convince young women how much that reputation, which re&s;ults from a ju&s;t behaviour and true good &s;en&s;e, is more valu|able than what can be attained from the pattern of a cap, or fancy of a furbelow.</P>
<P><PB N="842" REF="448">Beauty, you may &s;ay, deceives the owner &s;till more than it doth its admirers: it di&s;turbs, it in|toxicates the &s;oul. The mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lover is not more an idolater of his mi&s;tre&s;s than &s;he is of her&s;elf. A &s;mall number of years takes away the di&s;|tinction between a hand&s;ome woman and another, and reduces them both to an equality. Beauty is &s;ure to be pernicious unle&s;s it is in&s;trumental to an advantageous match.&mdash;But how can it be &s;o, unle&s;s &s;upported by merit, and by virtue? When, for want of di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty, &s;he is no ob|ject for men of correct under&s;tandings and &s;en&s;ible of &s;olid qualities, whom can &s;he hope to attract but &s;ome young fool, who will make her un|happy?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who found all their glory upon their beauty, in a &s;hort time become ridiculous; for, unperceived by them&s;elves, they arrive to that time of life when its lu&s;tre decays: yet &s;till are they charming in their own eyes, though the world is &s;o far from being charmed with them, that they in&s;pire nothing but di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>This ab&s;olute attachment to beauty alone, is ju&s;t as unrea&s;onable as to place all merit in bodily &s;trength, as do the barbarians and uncivilized na|tions.</P>
<P>True gracefulne&s;s hath not the lea&s;t dependance on a vain and affected mode of dre&s;s: yet it is not ami&s;s to have &s;ome regard to propriety, propor|tion, and &s;uitablene&s;s in our apparel, with which we nece&s;&s;arily cover our&s;elves.&mdash; But then the&s;e materials, which we mu&s;t put on, and which we
<PB N="843" REF="449">
may render as commodious as we plea&s;e, can ne|ver, under the name of ornaments, inve&s;t us with real beauty.</P>
<P>I would take the pains to &s;hew young ladies the noble &s;implicity that appears in the &s;tatues and other figures remaining with us, of the Greek and Roman women. There they will &s;ee, that the hair tied negligently in a knot behind, the drapery full and floating in long pleats, are at the &s;ame time agreeable and maje&s;tic.</P>
<P>It would be well if they were to hear the di&s;|cour&s;e of &s;ome painters, or any other per&s;on that has entered into the exqui&s;ite ta&s;te of the an|cients. Let their minds be elevated ever &s;o little above the prejudion of fa&s;hion, and they will quick|ly hold in contempt tho&s;e methods of torturing the hair into unnatural curls, in which there is neither grace nor elegance.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible we are not to propo&s;e they &s;hould copy the garb of antiquity: that would be an ex|travagant thing; but they may, without &s;ingula|rity, adopt the ta&s;te of &s;implicity in dre&s;s, &s;o no|ble, &s;o graceful, and &s;o &s;uitable to the decent manners of Chri&s;tians; &s;o that while they out|wardly conform to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom, they might at lea&s;t learn how to think of it: they would fall in with the fa&s;hion as a di&s;agreeable obligation, and allow no more to it than they can|not well avoid. Teach them early and frequently to ob&s;erve the vanity, the gidine&s;s, whence the incon&s;tancy of fa&s;hion ari&s;es. That it is a matter very ill under&s;tood, appears plainly when we &s;ee
<PB N="844" REF="450">
per&s;ons encumber their heads with a load of or|naments: true elegance follows nature, and never con&s;trains her.</P>
<P>But fa&s;hion de&s;troys it&s;elf; pretends to aim at perfection, and never hits it: at lea&s;t it will not &s;top there. Some rea&s;on there would be in chang|ing, in order to change no more, after having once found what is perfectly commodious and gen|teel; but to go on changing without end, &s;urely this is to pur&s;ue incon&s;tancy and irregularity, not genuine politene&s;s, nor good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>And &s;o in general mere caprice predominates&mdash; 'tis the women's prerogative to decide in this mat|ter. Thus the lighte&s;t, the &s;hallowe&s;t under|&s;tanding, influences all others: they neither take up, nor quit any thing upon rea&s;on. It has been the mode for a con&s;iderable time, though never &s;o well invented, that's enough to di&s;|card it; and another, though never &s;o ridicu|lous, &s;hall take its place, and be admired by its title to novelty.</P>
<P>After having laid this ground-work, we may go farther, and &s;hew the regulations of Chri&s;tian mode&s;ty:&mdash;and may &s;ay, we are taught by our re|ligion, that man is conceived in &s;in; his body af|flicted by a contagious illne&s;s, proves an inexhau&s;|tible &s;ource of temptation to his &s;oul. Je&s;us Chri&s;t teaches us to place all our virtue in fear, and in di&s;|tru&s;t of our&s;elves&mdash;would you be willing, one may ask, to hazard your own &s;oul, or your neighbour's, for the &s;ake of a fooli&s;h vanity? Be terrified then at the thought of di&s;playing the uncovered bo&s;om,
<PB N="845" REF="451">
and every other immode&s;ty.&mdash;Though the&s;e faults were committed without de&s;ign, &s;till they are the re&s;ult of vanity, and an unbridled de&s;ire of plea&s;|ing. Can this be a ju&s;tification before God or man for &s;o ra&s;h a conduct; &s;o &s;candalous, &s;o con|tagious to others? This blind de&s;ire of plea&s;ing doth it &s;uit with the mind of a Chri&s;tian, who ought to regard as a &s;pecies of idolatry every thing that turns us away from the love of the Creator, and, in compari&s;on with him, the contempt of the creatures?</P>
<P>In &s;eeking to plea&s;e what mean we? Is it not to excite the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind? and have they &s;o much power over them as &s;hall re&s;train them from going to exce&s;s? Ought we not to impute to our|&s;elves all the con&s;equences? and do they not al|ways run too high if once put in motion?</P>
<P>It is you that prepare a &s;ubtle and mortal poi|&s;on, pour it out upon the &s;pectators, and believe your&s;elf innocent.</P>
<P>Add to this argument, examples of per&s;ons who&s;e mode&s;ty has been their commendation; and others who&s;e immode&s;ty has drawn upon them the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>Never &s;uffer them to wear what is beyond their rank. Check all their fancies&mdash;&s;hew them the dan|ger, the contempt they are expo&s;ed to from all per&s;ons of di&s;cretion, when they in this manner forget who they are.</P>
<P>Another article remains, with regard to girls of a fine genius, which is, to bring them into a right way of thinking; for if we do not take care,
<PB N="846" REF="452">
they, in their vivacity, are apt to intermeddle, to talk on mo&s;t things, to give their opinion on &s;ub|jects di&s;proportioned to their capacity: at other times to affect a li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s out of pure delicacy.</P>
<P>A young lady &s;hould not talk but as occa&s;ion requires, and then with an air of doubt and de|ference: nay, as to &s;ubjects out of the reach of women in general, &s;he &s;hould not &s;peak upon them at all, though well informed. For what if her me|mory be never &s;o good? what if &s;he has vivacity, a plea&s;ant turn of &s;peech, a faculty of conver&s;ing with ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s? all the&s;e qualities will be in common to her, and many others of her &s;ex, far from being &s;en&s;ible women, and in them&s;elves de&s;picable. In&s;tead of this, let her endeavour after an exact and &s;teady conduct, an uniform and cor|rect &s;tate of mind: let her learn how to keep council, and carry on an affair of moment: this quality, &s;o rare to be found, will &s;ufficiently di&s;|tingui&s;h her.</P>
<P>As to delicacy, and the affectation of li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, the&s;e are to be repre&s;&s;ed by demon&s;trating how true good ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ts in accommodating one|&s;elf to things according to their utility.</P>
<P>Good &s;en&s;e and virtue alone are worthy of e&s;ti|mation; and both the&s;e require of us to look up|on di&s;like and li&s;tle&s;ne&s;ne&s;s not as a commendable delicacy, but as the infirmity of a &s;ickly mind.</P>
<P>Seeing we mu&s;t conver&s;e with gro&s;s under&s;tand|ings, and have a &s;hare in unentertaining bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, it is the part of rea&s;on, which is the only

true delicacy, to be as unrefined as tho&s;e we are to mingle with.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit which hath all the ta&s;te for politene&s;s, but which knows to ri&s;e above it upon a nece&s;|&s;ity to enter into more &s;olid matters, is infinitely &s;u|perior to tho&s;e &s;o delicate ones, and &s;urcharged with their own di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>In the next place let us proceed to the con&s;ide|ration of tho&s;e many articles with which a married woman ought to be acquainted: what are her du|ties? Upon her lies the education of her children; of the boys to a certain age, of the girls till they be married; the government of her dome&s;tics, their morals, their &s;ervice; the disbur&s;ements of hou&s;e-keeping, the method of living with oeconomy, and at the &s;ame time in figure; often even the lett|ing of farms, and receiving rents. Women's know|ledge, and that of men's al&s;o, ought to be limited by their functions, and the difference of them ought to make the difference of their &s;tudies: by this rule then the &s;ubjects above-mentioned will be the bounds of female information; but at this rate, a woman of curio&s;ity will be apt to think it put un|der great re&s;traints. She deceives her&s;elf, and all for want of perceiving the importance and extent of the things I propo&s;e for her to learn.</P>
<P>What degree of penetration is requi&s;ite for her to di&s;cern the temper, the genius of every particular child; to fall upon a method of con|duct towards each that &s;hall be&s;t di&s;cover their hu|mour, their bia&s;s, and their talents; to check the pa&s;&s;ions on their fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ure; to in&s;til whole|&s;ome

maxims, and remedy every error. How much prudence ought &s;he to be mi&s;tre&s;s of, for gaining and maintaining an a&s;cendency over them, without ri&s;quing the lo&s;s of friend&s;hip and confi|dence? Nay, is it not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to ob&s;erve and thoroughly know the per&s;ons &s;he places about her children? Mo&s;t certainly. A mo|ther of a family ought to be fully in&s;tructed in religion, endowed with an under&s;tanding &s;ound, &s;teady, a&s;&s;iduous, and exerci&s;ed in government.</P>
<P>Can any one doubt of the&s;e duties being incum|bent on women, &s;eeing they naturally fall to their &s;hare even in the life-time of their husbands, when otherwi&s;e employed or ab&s;ent from home? and to a &s;tate of widowhood they are more immediately annexed.</P>
<P>Here I omit to enter into all the particulars a woman &s;hould be in&s;tructed in for the purpo&s;e of education; becau&s;e this hint may &s;erve to give them a notion in general of the exten&s;ive know|ledge they ought to have. Add to this, family oeconomy. The generality of ladies look upon that as a mean employment, only fit for coun|try people and farmers, or, at mo&s;t, for a hou&s;e-&s;teward or woman hou&s;ekeeper; and the&s;e more e&s;pecially who are bred up in &s;oftne&s;s, plenty, and idlene&s;s, hold every branch of it in the utmo&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e conceive very little difference between a life in the country and the life of the &s;avages of Canada. Talk to them of corn, of cultivation, of the nature of e&s;tates, or rents, or rights of

lord&s;hips, of the be&s;t way of letting land, or ap|pointing receivers, they will believe you are for having them degrade them&s;elves:&mdash;and yet this proceeds from pure ignorance. The ancient Greeks and the Romans, tho&s;e adroit and po|li&s;hed people, applied them&s;elves diligently to this &s;cience of oeconomy. The noble&s;t among them wrote books (which are &s;till pre&s;erved to us) upon their own experience, and de&s;cended even to the lowe&s;t articles of husbandry.</P>
<P>It is a known fact that their victorious generals di&s;dained not to work with their own hands, and from the triumphal car returned to the plough.</P>
<P>This is &s;o di&s;tant from our manner, that it would not be credited did hi&s;tory leave the lea&s;t room to doubt. Whereas what more natural rea&s;on is there for our defending or enlarging our territo|ries than in order to cultivate them in peace? Of what &s;ervice is victory but to gather the fruits of peace?</P>
<P>After all, true &s;olidity of under&s;tanding con|&s;i&s;ts in a willingne&s;s to be exactly informed how all tho&s;e things are managed, which are the &s;ub|&s;tantials of human life; for upon the&s;e the very greate&s;t affairs are grounded.</P>
<P>The power and the felicity of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts not in a multitude of provinces ill cultivated; but in the knowing to rai&s;e from its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions a &s;uf|ficency to maintain, without difficulty, a nume|rous people.</P>
<P>To attain a knowledge of every art applicable to oeconomy, to regulate the &s;um of all the af|fairs
<PB N="850" REF="456">
of a family, which may be &s;tiled a &s;mall re|public,, requires, undoubtedly, much higher ge|nius, and more exten&s;ive, than to under&s;tand play, or to de&s;cant on the fa&s;hions, or to exert all the minute gentilities of conver&s;ation. It is but a de&s;picable &s;pirit that can do no more than di&s;cour&s;e well. Women there are in numbers who&s;e talk abounds with &s;olid maxims; but in who&s;e con|duct, for want of early application, nothing but the frivolous is to be found.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, we mu&s;t be on our guard again&s;t the oppo&s;ite fault; women run a ri&s;que of going into extremes. It is good to u&s;e them from their childhood to have &s;omething under their care, to keep accounts, to know the method of buying, and how every thing ought to be made, to be u&s;e|ful; yet I &s;ay, take care le&s;t oeconomy &s;hould degenerate into avarice; be particular in &s;hewing the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of that pa&s;&s;ion; tell them to be cautious, for avarice produces but little pro|fit, and much di&s;honour. A rational mind need carry a frugal and diligent &s;cheme of life no far|ther than to avoid that &s;hame and inju&s;tice which are ever annexed to a prodigal, ruinous conduct. The true end of retrenching &s;uperfluous expence, is to be in a better capacity to an&s;wer all the calls of decency, friend&s;hip, and charity.</P>
<P>There are occa&s;ions when the parting with mo|ney is being a greater gainer. Good order is the profitable thing, and not a few petty articles of &s;ordid penuriou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;wherefore fail not to paint in &s;trong colours that gro&s;s mi&s;take of &s;ome la|dies,

who can plea&s;e them&s;elves with &s;aving a ta|per, and let a &s;teward wrong them in the bulk of their affairs.</P>
<P>Be no le&s;s a friend to neatne&s;s and order, than to oeconomy and hou&s;ewifery: u&s;e young ladies not to permit any &s;lutti&s;hne&s;s, or mi&s;placing of things about the hou&s;e, or furniture; and bring them to ob&s;erve that nothing contributes more to oecono|my and neatne&s;s than every thing being in its proper &s;tation: as minute as this maxim &s;eems, it will have con&s;iderable effects if &s;trictly kept to. Is any thing wanted? no time's wa&s;ted in looking for it; no trouble, di&s;pute, or di&s;turbance en&s;ues: you take it from its place, make u&s;e of it, and replace it again.</P>
<P>Order is a principal branch of neatne&s;s; be|cau&s;e a proper arrangement affects the eye for|cibly; and be&s;ides, the place a&s;&s;igned to each be|ing that which is mo&s;t &s;uitble to it, not only for plea&s;ing the eye, but for the pre&s;ervation of the thing, it is therefore le&s;s liable to decay, le&s;s lia|ble to accidental damage, and even &s;hews a pro|priety in its being there.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit of accuracy, which prompts to orderline&s;s, prompts al&s;o to cleanline&s;s. To which advantage add, that &s;uch a habit prevents idlene&s;s and confu&s;ion in our dome&s;tics: and more than this, as it makes them ready in the di&s;charge of their duties, &s;o doth it keep us clear of the temptation to impatience at the de|lays which mu&s;t happen, when the things we call for can hardly be found. But at the &s;ame time
<PB N="852" REF="458">
avoid running into an exce&s;s of elegance and nicety. Nicety in moderation is a virtue; but when we carry our ta&s;te to too great a height, it becomes narrowne&s;s of mind; for good ta&s;te re|jects extream delicacy: it treats little matters as they are, and will not be affected by them. There|fore &s;hew, in the children's pre&s;ence, your deri&s;ion of tho&s;e fopperies &s;ome women are &s;o fond of, and by which they are in&s;en&s;ibly drawn into u&s;ele&s;s ex|pences.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tom them to a plain and practicable nice|ne&s;s. You may inform them how every thing ought to be done; but &s;till further, that they ought to be ea&s;y without it&mdash;for what a &s;queami&s;h mind does it betray to grumble if a &s;oop fails of being exactly &s;ea&s;oned, another thing ill pleated, a chair a little too high or too low? Undoubt|edly it is an evidence of a much better under|&s;tanding to be de&s;ignedly indifferent, rather than delicate in matters &s;o in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>And this faulty delicacy, if not repre&s;&s;ed in wo|men of lively parts, has wor&s;e effects with regard to their conver&s;ation than other &s;ubjects; for to them the generality of company will &s;eem &s;o flat, and &s;o tire&s;ome, and the lea&s;t &s;lip in politene&s;s &s;o mon&s;trous, they are always full of &s;corn and di&s;|gu&s;t.

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Some reflections and deductions drawn from the works of Nature in general.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are now on the point of concluding the pre&s;ent de&s;ign of this work, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould form &s;ome kind of conclu&s;ion to that part of it which has had a relation to the works of Nature, and the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy. A conclu&s;ion, I &s;ay, with re&s;pect to our confined and narrow limits herein; for &s;uch is the immen&s;e &s;cope and extent which tho&s;e &s;ubjects would have afforded us, that could the pro&s;ecution of our plan have been pur&s;ued beyond the period of life alot|ted to our&s;elves or our children, nay, even to the farthe&s;t &s;tretch of time, our re&s;earches into the wonders of Nature's inexhau&s;tible &s;torehou&s;e, would have been no other than the pur&s;uance of an ap|parent horizon, the boundaries of which are ever flying before us, and although they every mo|ment pre&s;ent us with a fre&s;h variety of enchanting objects, yet are, with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, as ab|&s;olutely di&s;tant at the la&s;t as at the fir&s;t moment of our journey. But to proceed.</P>
<P>From even the very &s;mall portion concerning which we have been enabled to enter into a de|tail,
<PB N="858" REF="464">
of the numberle&s;s amazing properties be|&s;towed on mankind and on the other parts of the animal creation, what is the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t natural deduction that mu&s;t occur to every one? What, when we perceive that every one of the organs of this grand machine, not only the larger and more apparently u&s;eful, but even the more minute, in|&s;ignificant, and almo&s;t invi&s;ible ones, are furni&s;h|ed in the ample&s;t manner, not barely with &s;uch parts, &s;uch limbs, &s;uch mechani&s;m, as are needful for their mere exi&s;tence, but &s;till more particu|larly with &s;uch peculiar contrivances, &s;uch &s;aga|city, &s;uch intellectual faculties, as mu&s;t render that exi&s;tence, with re&s;pect to the place, &s;tation, and allotment of each individual, ab&s;olutely and perfectly happy:&mdash;&s;uch properties as enable every one of tho&s;e beings to pre&s;erve that exi&s;tence, though &s;urrounded by numberle&s;s dangers, and to procure the means of &s;upporting it in the mid&s;t of apparent &s;carcity and want. What, when we per|ceive the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances be&s;towed on them with an endle&s;s variety, with &s;uch a peculiar propriety to every &s;ingle animal, as if each was of it&s;elf the &s;ole and peculiar care of Providence:&mdash;What, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be the immediate re&s;ult of the&s;e ob&s;er|vations, but that the whole mu&s;t be the work of infinite power, of infinite wi&s;dom, of infinite goodne&s;s? Who can ca&s;t his eyes around him even with the &s;lighte&s;t reflection on what he &s;ees on every &s;ide, but mu&s;t immediately cry out with the royal philo&s;opher,
<Q>How manifold are thy works, O Lord! in wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all!</Q>
<PB N="859" REF="469">
Can any one perceive the work of amazing art, and maintain one moment's doubt of the exi&s;tence of the arti&s;t?&mdash;Mu&s;t he not indeed be a fool who can &s;ay in his heart there is no God?</P>
<P>If then this reflection is the fir&s;t that mu&s;t ari&s;e from this delightful &s;tudy, and mo&s;t undoubtedly it is &s;o, can we po&s;&s;ibly give &s;cope thereto without proceeding &s;till farther, and finding that due in|fluence produced by it on our minds which mu&s;t lead us to the warme&s;t gratitude, and the mo&s;t ar|dent zeal to do every thing that may lead towards the rendering our &s;ervices acceptable in his &s;ight? Can we look with unconcern on all the&s;e wondrous operations? Can we perceive the&s;e incompre|hen&s;ible proofs of infinite perfection, in what are but the mechanical exertion, perhaps no more than the &s;port, if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, of his wi&s;dom and power, without conceiving an idea infinitely more exalted of the almighty mind? Can we be blind to the proofs that the&s;e pre&s;ent us with, of his being equally the origin of all puri|ty, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all ability? Can we avoid being convinced that
<Q><L>He mu&s;t delight in virtue,</L>
<L>And that which he delights in mu&s;t be happy?</L></Q></P>
<P>How &s;trong an incitement this to the practice of that virtue which, at the &s;ame time, delights that Being who&s;e minute&s;t plea&s;ure ought to be our &s;upreme&s;t joy, and en&s;ures our own happine&s;s in the very act it&s;elf! How eminent then the ad|vantage to our&s;elves, and the good to &s;ociety in general, which might be derived from a proper
<PB N="860" REF="470">
application of this &s;tudy! and from how evident a parity of rea&s;oning will every thinking man be convinced, whil&s;t he &s;ees every part of the crea|tion in general formed with &s;uch a connection, &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary dependance on every other part, as well as on the great whole, how &s;trongly, I &s;ay, will he be convinced of the duty incumbent on him&s;elf to promote as much as po&s;&s;ible this grand de&s;ign, and render his every action conducive to it, in the peculiar circle which heaven has a&s;&s;igned to him to fill? In how &s;mooth, how tranquil a path might all the tran&s;actions of this world pro|ceed, would every man but carry the reflection from natural to moral connections; and, per&s;uad|ed, that his own happine&s;s mu&s;t proportionably depend on that of every individual around him, labour to accelerate the movement of the&s;e admi|rably contrived wheels, in&s;tead of clogging them with the intricate machinery of &s;elf-intere&s;t, or dragging them back with the weight of vice and folly.</P>
<P>But now let us con&s;ider Nature's works in a &s;econd point of view, let us con&s;ider man, and every other animated part of the creation as a &s;e|parate and detached being, and placed in his pe|culiar &s;phere without connection or relation&s;hip with any other: even in this light how admira|ble, how incomprehen&s;ible is the extent of omni|potent care in this formation of each! How amaz|ingly is each animal provided by the all-wi&s;e Foun|tain of good with every means for his pre&s;ervation! how admirably are dangers and nece&s;&s;ities &s;pread
<PB N="861" REF="467">
around him, as if they were de&s;igned to &s;hew the unlimited wi&s;dom of the Creator in the variety of means pointed out to him for avoiding the one, and relieving the other; at the &s;ame time that both are rendered the in&s;truments of his happi|ne&s;s, from that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of relief which heightens the enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing by a &s;en|&s;ibility of the mi&s;ery attached to its oppo&s;ite &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>In this view how much has man in particular to felicitate him&s;elf upon! how many grateful re|flections ought his mind to overflow with when he con&s;iders his &s;ituation as more expo&s;ed, more helple&s;s in its original and apparent &s;tate than that of any other animal; yet in the cour&s;e of life, in the period of his exi&s;tence more thoroughly pro|tected, more perfectly &s;upplied with conveniencies than that of his fellow-creatures would be, even if the various re&s;ources of them all could be united for the &s;ervice of each individual. With what an eye of admiration ought he to look up to the Being, who, by a peculiar di&s;tinction, has &s;o highly and almo&s;t partially favoured him, as to be&s;tow on him alone that &s;ingle &s;park from heaven, that emanation from him&s;elf, which in it&s;elf an&s;wers every purpo&s;e that any thing beneath immortality ought to wi&s;h for the power of executing.</P>
<P>Again, let us permit this la&s;t reflection to pro|duce another very proper effect on our minds, and at the &s;ame time that it in&s;pires us with the mo&s;t exalted degree of acknowledgment to the ju&s;t giver of all things, &s;uffer it to &s;trike us with

<P>But let this lord of nature, this &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, call his eyes around and &s;ee all other beings emerging into life almo&s;t in a &s;tate of per|fection; let him look on the poor &s;ervile dog, and the dome&s;tic kitten, within two months of their appearance in the world able to quit the tender parent's care, and &s;eek their prey, endowed with all the faculties to find and to de&s;troy it.

After even this &s;light review, let him but turn his eyes back on his own infant &s;tate, and &s;ee him|&s;elf "mewling and puking in the nur&s;e's arms," unable for a time to find a u&s;e even for his very limbs; for a yet longer period of time deprived of the advantages of language, and &s;till much longer under the nece&s;&s;ity of aid, and of in&s;truc|tion

<P>Again, when brought to his maturity and ful|ne&s;s of perfection as to his natural &s;tate, how &s;till deficient in every particular both of attack, de|fence, and &s;u&s;tenance! Fir&s;t, for attack, the lion has his teeth, the bull his horns, the eagle his ta|lons, and the hawk his beak, either to combat with their foes or to de&s;troy their prey:&mdash;but what has man? None of all the&s;e. Con&s;ider him un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted, he could not &s;tab the &s;heep, knock down the ox, or combat with the hog, did either know his weakne&s;s or their own power to re&s;i&s;t him. With what propriety then do we pray to the Be|&s;tower and Di&s;po&s;er of all life to give us our daily Bread!</P>
<P>Next for defence, the hor&s;e has his heels, the fox his holes, the calamary can &s;pread a cloud of ink around him, and the torpedo &s;trike with numbne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility the creature which &s;hall dare to touch him. The cat can &s;well her form to twice its &s;ize, and even a little bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Wryneck.</NOTE> di&s;tort her figure into &s;uch &s;hapes of terror, as &s;hall deter even ani|mals of bulk and power from coming near her ne&s;t.&mdash;But which of the&s;e advantages does man po&s;&s;e&s;s? His &s;peed the heavy elephant will over|take; he cannot dig into the earth to hide him from his foe; nor with his firme&s;t frown or fierce&s;t attitude drive back the hungry wolf or half &s;tarved tyger.</P>
<P><PB N="864" REF="474">Then for his &s;u&s;tenance, the crocodile can change his form, and the camelion his colour, the &s;pider &s;pread a web, and the polypus expand a net, to allure and to entrap their prey: but man, unaided by the means of art, and of a thou&s;and &s;ub&s;tances not any way appertaining to him&s;elf, might &s;tarve in the mid&s;t of plenty, and daily &s;uf|fer the fabled fate of Tantalus, to &s;ee perpetually before him the greate&s;t delicacies without being able to procure or to enjoy them.</P>
<P>What deductions then may be drawn from the&s;e ob&s;ervations? Evidently the two following, with which we &s;hall terminate this di&s;cour&s;e: viz. Fir&s;t, that whatever we may imagine of our&s;elves, and of our &s;elf-applied &s;uperiority, it mu&s;t, if it has exi&s;tence at all, be owing to the favour of that omnipotent Being, who was equally the creator of all other creatures as of our&s;elves; and that therefore, in&s;tead of harbouring an unbecoming pride on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the peculiar gift of rea|&s;on, which &s;upplies, in one &s;ingle property, all the deficiencies I have been ju&s;t mentioning, we ought a&s;&s;uredly to be in&s;pired with the utmo&s;t humility united to gratitude, when we con&s;ider our&s;elves as &s;elected out to enjoy that ble&s;&s;ing from amid&s;t &s;uch an infinite variety of his other works, every one of which appears to have an equal, and many of them even a higher claim to that mo&s;t de&s;irable preference:&mdash;and &s;econdly, that &s;ince in natural advantages many even of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ignificant beings &s;eem greatly

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION of the I&s;land of CEYLON. CONCLUDED.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are in this i&s;land a very particular kind of blacki&s;h leaches, which lurk under the gra&s;s, and are extremely trouble&s;ome to foot travellers. They are at fir&s;t not thicker than a hor&s;e hair; but grow to be of the bulk of a goo&s;e's quill, and two or three inches in length. They are only to be &s;een in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, at which times crawling up the legs of tho&s;e who walk bare|foot, as is the cu&s;tom of that country, they &s;ting them, and &s;uck their blood with &s;o much quick|ne&s;s, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to get rid of them be|fore they have effected their purpo&s;e. This might &s;eem incredible, were it not for the prodigious multitudes in which they make their attacks, which con&s;equently renders a con&s;iderable time nece&s;&s;ary to oblige them to quit their hold.</P>
<P>As the i&s;land is very full of woods and lakes, it is natural to imagine that it mu&s;t al&s;o be very amply &s;tored with birds and fi&s;hes. Among the former are great plenty of green perroquets; but of a kind that cannot be taught to &s;peak. They have two other &s;orts of birds, however, which learn very ea&s;ily; they are about the &s;ize of a black-bird, and are called by the natives by the names of mal-couda and cau-couda: the fir&s;t is black, and the other of a bright gold colour.</P>
<P><PB N="839" REF="476">As to fi&s;h, their lakes and rivers are extremely full of them, particularly of &s;almon; but the in|habitants &s;eem to &s;et no great value on them.</P>
<P>Serpents of many kinds, both venemous and in|offen&s;ive, are found in this i&s;land: among&s;t which the mo&s;t remarkable are, 1&s;t. the pimberah, which is as thick as a man's body, feeds mo&s;tly on deer, and other animals of a like kind; and it is &s;aid, will &s;wallow a kid whole, who&s;e horns will &s;ome|times pierce through his belly, and kill him. 2d. the polonga, which is about five or &s;ix feet long, and extremely venemous. And 3d. the noya, which is a greyi&s;h &s;nake, not above four feet long, and is marked on its head with the appearance of a pair of &s;pectacles. He is a mortal enemy to the polonga, and whenever they meet the battle con|&s;tantly terminates in the death of one or the other of them. He is, however, very harmle&s;s, on which account the Indians call him noya rodgerah, or the royal &s;nake.</P>
<P>There is a kind of venemous lizard in this country which they name hiekanella, and which harbours in the eves and thatchings of the hou&s;es, but will not attack a man unle&s;s provoked. But the mo&s;t formidable creature belonging to this i&s;|land is a prodigious large black hairy &s;pider, which they call democulo. Its body is as large as one's fi&s;t, and its legs proportionable. Nothing can be more mocking than its bite, which is not immediately mortal, but affects the &s;en&s;es, and occa&s;ions madne&s;s. As to the men, they find a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in this ca&s;e from certain herbs and barks,
<PB N="834" REF="477">
when applied to in time; but the cattle are fre|quently bit or &s;tung by the&s;e mon&s;trous creatures, and die without any remedy having been yet di&s;|covered to pre&s;erve them.</P>
<P>As to the mineral kingdom, this country pro|duces many kinds of gems, and in great quantity, particularly &s;apphires, rubies, and cat's eyes; but the&s;e are all &s;ecured for the king's u&s;e. They have be&s;ides both iron and lead mines; but the&s;e, as well as many other valuable productions of the i&s;land, are con&s;idered of little worth compared to the cinnamon and wild honey; which, are, pro|perly &s;peaking, the peculiar traffick of the coun|try, and of which the Dutch have made an amaz|ing advantage &s;ince their conque&s;t of it.</P>
<P>Having thus got through the de&s;cription of the i&s;land of Ceylon, and mentioned the mo&s;t extra|ordinary particulars of curio&s;ity in it, we &s;hall now take leave of our readers, recommending to their peru&s;al the farther accounts given by the travel|lers who have vi&s;ited it, and who &s;eem all to unite in opinion as to its being one of the fine&s;t, mo&s;t amply &s;tored, and mo&s;t amazingly diver&s;ified &s;pot throughout the whole extent of the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
