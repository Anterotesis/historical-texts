<HEAD>The HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY Father, George Jones, commonly called Black George, on account of his &s;warthy co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lexion, was one of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious men in the whole village. His cottage, which was his own, and partly built by his own hands, &s;tands on the Common, about a &s;tone's ca&s;t from the road, near the great Oak tree, in the pari&s;h of King's Charleton, in Somer&s;et&s;hire. The Lord of the Manor having granted him leave to inclo&s;e a bit of the Common for a garden, my father had got a thriving young orchard and a long &s;trip of potatoes, be&s;ides his cottage, all the produce of his own indu&s;try. It u&s;ed to be a favourite &s;aying with him, that no man, to whom God had given two hands, had ever need to want. "For my part," &s;ays he, "I never knew what want was. When I am &s;ick, the club &s;upports me; and when I am well, I warrant I'll &s;upport my&s;elf." My mother, be&s;ides being equally indu&s;trious, was much more religious, and there|fore much happier. She was as good and as &s;weet-tempered a woman as any in the world, be the next where &s;he will. For con&s;tancy at her place of wor&s;hip, civility to her neighbours, cleanline&s;s in her own per&s;on, her hou&s;e and her children, &s;he had not her fellow. But the mo&s;t remarkable thing in her (I am afraid a very uncommon thing) was her &s;teady and uninterrupted practice of family prayer. It mu&s;t have been a hard day's work in|deed that hindered her from her prayers. At &s;ix in the morning and eight in the evening, as regu|larly as ever the hour came, &s;he always knelt down with her children round her, four of us, and read with great &s;olemnity and devotion a &s;hort form given her by the clergyman, which concluded with the Lord's prayer, in which we all joined. And &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay after &s;he had fini&s;hed&mdash;"Now I can
<PB N="3" REF="3">
go to bed or to work, in peace; for now we may hope God will protect us." I am &s;orry to &s;ay my father &s;eldom joined with us. He u&s;ed to pretend he was bu&s;y or tired; and yet it would not have detained him long neither, for we were never more than &s;ix minutes about it, and &s;urely twelve minutes a day '&s;ix in the morning and &s;ix in the evening) is no great time to give to God. One thing has often &s;truck me, that if any thing went wrong and ruffled my dear mothers temper, or made her un|ea&s;y, the prayers &s;eemed to &s;et it all to rights. When &s;he had been to prayers, all her grief &s;eemed to be &s;led away. And indeed I ob&s;erved the &s;ame thing with re&s;pect to my father; if he ever did join with us, it always &s;eemed &s;omehow to compo&s;e and &s;weeten his mind, and make him a great deal kinder to my mother and us.</P>
<P>As my Father and mother were very indu&s;trious them&s;elves, they were very de&s;irous to make their children &s;o; every child was employed as &s;oon as he was able in &s;omething or other. At about thirteen years of age my employment had been for &s;ome time to weed in the par&s;on's garden and run of errands for him. At fourteen he took me into his hou&s;e, and not a little proud was I at ob|taining the title of his "little footman." The morning I left my father's cottage, my dear mother, who was as kind as &s;he was good, appeared to be very much affected; &s;he &s;aid &s;he could not commit me to the wide world, without fir&s;t committing me to God who governed it; and then &s;he knelt down with me by her &s;ide, and prayed, "Gracious Lord, be plea&s;ed to have mercy on my dear boy. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the care I commend him. Guard him I be&s;eech thee in the many temptations which he is now beginning to encounter. May he with &s;olid pity and hone&s;t di|ligence do his duty in that &s;tate of life in which it
<PB N="4" REF="4">
hath plea&s;ed thee to place him." She then gave me her ble&s;&s;ing, put a Te&s;tament into my pocket, bid me fear God, and always act for my ma&s;ter as I would do for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In my new &s;ituation there were to be &s;ure &s;ome few things di&s;agreeable. My mi&s;tre&s;s was peevi&s;h, and fretful; the cook violent and pa&s;&s;ionate. But what &s;ervice is there, or indeed, what &s;ituation in life, how&s;oever much above &s;ervitude, in which there is not &s;omething unplea&s;ant. Every &s;tate has it's trials: &s;ervants have theirs: but if they cannot learn to put up with &s;ome little inconveniences, they may change their places every year of their lives, and never be &s;atisfied after all. This is a le&s;&s;on I have learnt by long experience.</P>
<P>Though by God's ble&s;&s;ing I had received a more religious education than mo&s;t children, it yet &s;oon appeared that I had many faults, which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to be corrected of before I could become a good &s;ervant. At fir&s;t, when I was &s;ent upon an errand, I was much given to loitering. I was then too young to con&s;ider that by loitering in errands I was wa&s;ting what was not my own, my ma&s;ter's time. Be&s;ides this fault, as every thing which I &s;aw and heard in my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e was &s;uch as I had never &s;een and heard before, I was too apt to talk of it to my old playfellows, or at the village &s;hop, But as &s;oon as ever I became a little older, I began to reflect that this was very wrong. One Sunday evening, when I had leave to go home to &s;ee my parents, I was beginning to te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my mother how there had been a great uproar a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the par&s;onage the day before about&mdash;. Here &s;he put her hand upon my lips, and &s;aid, "Charles, no a word more of what has pa&s;&s;ed at the par&s;onage What&s;oever happens in your ma&s;ter's hou&s;e is neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be &s;poken of out of your ma&s;ter's doors. A tale
<PB N="5" REF="5">
bearing &s;ervant is always an unfaithful &s;ervant; he betrays the tru&s;t which his ma&s;ter puts in him."</P>
<P>My mother's vehemence &s;urprized me a little, but it made &s;o much impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I was pretty well broken of the fault from that very time. Into how many &s;crapes has this talkative temper brought many &s;ervants of my acquaintance! There was poor Nic. Jarrett, the Squire's under footman, that lo&s;t his place, a new &s;uit of black broad cloth, and a legacy of five pounds, which he would &s;oon have had by rea&s;on of his ma&s;ter's death, only for &s;aying at a neighbour's hou&s;e, that his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ome|times fell a&s;leep while the Squire was reading to the family on a Sunday night.</P>
<P>Nic. and I were at one time rather too intimate; I remember one day, when I was about &s;ixteen, having attended my ma&s;ter to the Squire's hou&s;e, Nic. pre|vailed on me after dinner to play with him at pitch and to&s;s. I was worth at that time five &s;hillings and two-pence, more money than I had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before in my life. In about two hours Nic. reduced me to my la&s;t &s;hilling. But though it was a heavy &s;troke at the time, yet it proved in the end a happy event, for, by my mother's per&s;ua&s;ions, I re&s;olved thence forward never to game again as long as I lived, which re&s;olution, by God's grace, I have hitherto happily kept. I wi&s;h from my heart that all other &s;ervants would re&s;olve the &s;ame. The practice of card-playing, &s;o common among&s;t &s;er|vants in large families, is the wor&s;t cu&s;tom they can po&s;&s;ibly fall into. My poor brother Tom &s;uffered enough for it. One day, having received in the morning a quarter's wages, he lo&s;t the whole of it before night at All-fours; and what was the con&s;e|quence? Why, from that very time, he took to tho&s;e practices of cheating his ma&s;ter which ended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his ruin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="6" REF="6">
&s;ervants, if in&s;tead of wa&s;ting their lei&s;ure in card playing, they would amu&s;e them&s;elves in reading &s;ome godly book, or improve them&s;elves in writing or cyphering. It was by this means, for I was never taught to write, that I qualified my&s;elf for the place of Bailiff which I now fill.</P>
<P>I remember Nic. u&s;ed to &s;ay. "Whil&s;t my ma&s;ter plays cards in the parlour, why &s;hould&s;t thou be &s;o &s;queami&s;h as not to play in the kitchen." But Nic. did not con&s;ider that his ma&s;ter being rich, and playing for &s;mall &s;ums, his lo&s;&s;es laid him under no temptation of di&s;hone&s;ty in order to repair them; be&s;ides, the Squire could read and write at any time, whereas this was our only lei&s;ure time, and if we did not improve our&s;elves then we never could; what might be comparatively innocent in him, might be ruinous to us. And even if my ma&s;ter be a pro|fe&s;&s;ed gambler, that is no rea&s;on I &s;hould be &s;o too. A &s;ervant is to do what is right, let his ma&s;ter do what he will. If a ma&s;ter &s;wears and gets drunk, and talks at table with indecency, or again&s;t God and religion, to God he mu&s;t account for it, and a &s;orry account it will be I doubt; but his example will not excu&s;e our crimes, though it will aggravate his. We mu&s;t take care of our own &s;ouls, whether our ma&s;ters take care of theirs or not.</P>
<P>But to return to my hi&s;tory; I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay that I was guilty more than once in the earlier part of my &s;ervitude, of the &s;hocking and dete&s;table crime of lying, in order to excu&s;e or &s;creen my faults. Happily I was cured of it in the following manner: Having been one day ordered to carry a bottle of wine to a &s;ick man, one of my ma&s;ter's pari&s;hioners, I accidentally broke the bottle, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cour&s;e lo&s;t the wine. What was to be done? Should I confe&s;s my misfortune and acknowledge my care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, or conceal it by a lie? After &s;ame delibe
<PB N="7" REF="7">
made up my &s;tory, "how the poor man &s;ent his duty to my ma&s;ter and thanked him a thou&s;and times, and that he was a little better, and that his wife &s;aid &s;he thought this wine would &s;ave his life." Being thus prepared, as I was returning home, I met a pedlar, of whom I bought for a penny a little book, containing a &s;tory of a woman at Devizes, who was &s;truck dead on the &s;pot for telling a lie. To be &s;ure it was Heaven that &s;ent the Pedlar to me, to &s;ave me from the &s;in I was going to commit. "If this woman was &s;truck dead for a lie," &s;aid I to my&s;elf, "why may not I?" I therefore went directly home, and made a confe&s;&s;ion of my negligence and misfortune. And it was well for me I did; for the &s;ick man, who&s;e duty and thanks I had wickedly intended to carry to my ma&s;ter, was dead, as I un|der&s;tood afterwards, three hours before the bottle was broken. From this time, therefore, I began to &s;ee, what I am now fully convinced of, that be|&s;ide the &s;infulne&s;s of lying, it was always more for the intere&s;t and la&s;ting comfort of &s;ervants to con|fe&s;s the truth at once, than to conceal a fault by fal&s;ehood. When a &s;ervant has told a lie, he is always in danger of it's being found out; and &s;ooner or later it generally is found out, and then his character is ruin|ed. Whereas, if he confe&s;&s;es the truth at once, he probably e&s;capes without any anger at all, or at wor&s;t it is &s;oon over, and the fault it&s;elf is forgotten.</P>
<P>Having now lived &s;even years at the par&s;onage, and being twenty-one years of age, my ma&s;ter called me one day into his &s;tudy, where he &s;pent a good deal of his time, and &s;aid to me, "Charles, you have lived with me a con&s;iderable time, and it has been always with much plea&s;ure that I have re|marked the decency, &s;obriety and diligence of your conduct. Tho&s;e few faults which you have, farther experience and more years will, I doubt not cure
<PB N="8" REF="8">
You are now qualified for a better place than mine, and are entitled to higher wages than it is in my power to give. I have, therefore recommended you to a friend of mine in London, for which place you are to &s;et out, if you approve it, in a month. But I &s;hould think it a crime to di&s;mi&s;s you to a &s;ituation &s;o full of temptations, without giving you &s;ome little advice. Li&s;ten, therefore, my dear Charles, to what I &s;hall &s;ay, as I mean it only for your good. In the fir&s;t place, fear God; and then you will never have any occa&s;ion to be afraid of man. Act always as in his pre&s;ence. Never enter or quit your bed without prayer. Do always for your ma&s;ter, as you would your ma&s;ter, if you were to change places, &s;hould do for you. Endeavour to get a pious friend, but avoid, as you would the plague, all wicked company. Be cautious of too great familiarity with your female fellow &s;ervants: an unlawful intercour&s;e of this kind will ruin you, body and &s;oul. Flee from an alehou&s;e as you would from the Devil; if you once get into it, you will ne|ver be out of it. Keep your money, and your money will keep you. Here, Charles, is a Bible for you: the more you read it, the more you will love it, and the more you love it, the better you will be and the happier. I have written &s;ome directions for you in the fir&s;t page of it. God ble&s;s you; and when my race, which is now drawing to its end, &s;hall fini&s;h, may we meet in heaven." My ma&s;ter's kindne&s;s &s;o affected me, that I could not an&s;wer him for tears. I was indeed very glad of going to &s;o fine a place as London, though at the &s;ame time I could not leave a hou&s;e where I had been treated more like a child than a &s;ervant without great re|gret. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe my parting with my mother. No de&s;cription, I am &s;ure, could do ju&s;tice to the &s;olemn and affectionate manner in
<PB N="9" REF="9">
which &s;he exhorted me to be pious and ju&s;t, and recommended me to God in prayer. Her la&s;t words I &s;hall never forget.&mdash;" I know, my dear &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "that you love me tenderly, and that you would not give me unnece&s;&s;ary pain on any account. Remember then, that whenever you do any wrong thing, you are planting a dagger in your mother's heart." With the&s;e words, her eyes brim full of tears, and her hands li&s;ted up in &s;ilent prayer to God, &s;he turned away from me and went into the cottage.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, you find me in the great and dangerous city of London, in the &s;ervice of a very wealthy ma&s;ter, who kept twelve &s;ervants, be&s;ides my&s;elf. If country people knew London as well as I do, how cautious they would be of exchanging their &s;afe and peaceful &s;ituations in the country for the perils and temptations of a great city. How many young fellows have I known, who lived ho|ne&s;tly and happily in their native place, come up to London in the hope of higher wages, and there forfeit their integrity, their peace of mind, their health, their character and &s;ouls. Workmen in particular are very fond of getting into large cities, becau&s;e they think their labour will turn to better account there than in their own villages. They do not con&s;ider that in a city, they mu&s;t give as much for a filthy room in a filthy hou&s;e, inhabited by half a dozen families, &s;ituated in a clo&s;e, &s;mokey, dirty &s;treet, as in the country would pay the rent of a cot|tage and a garden. They do not con&s;ider the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions in a city, the temptations they are un|der from bad women, wicked company, and the great number of alehou&s;es. In &s;hort, I am fully per&s;uaded that a labourer in the country, on a &s;hilling a days, is better off than one in a city on two &s;hillings.</P>
<P>When I came to my place, I found every thing for the fir&s;t three or four days very &s;mooth and
<PB N="10" REF="10">
very plea&s;ant, plenty of provi&s;ions, plenty of drink, little work, and a very merry &s;ervants' hall. But &s;oon the face of things, with re&s;pect to me, changed very much, and I underwent a &s;everer temptation than I ever experienced before or &s;ince in the whole cour&s;e of my life. I had always hitherto been taught to con&s;ider that &s;obriety, and diligence, and piety were virtues. I therefore never &s;wore, I never got drunk, I never gamed, I went to church as often as I could, I &s;aid my prayers night and morning, and on Sunday at lea&s;t, if not on other days, I read a little in my good old ma&s;ter's Bible. But here I &s;oon found that all this was the wor&s;t vice I could be guilty of. As &s;oon as they found me out, it &s;eemed to be a trial of &s;kill among&s;t them who &s;hould plague me mo&s;t. One called me the Par&s;on; another, Me|thodi&s;t; a third, a conceited Prig; a fourth, a cant|ing Hypocrite. If I went into any other gentle|man's kitchen it was all the &s;ame: my character always flew before me, and many were the je&s;ts and laughs rai&s;ed both at home and abroad at my ex|pence. In &s;hort, during three months, my life was a con&s;tant &s;tate of anxiety and torment; &s;o that at la&s;t I was almo&s;t tempted, God forgive me for the thought, to do as they did, and forfeit my everla&s;t|ing &s;oul in order to avoid the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s. But while things were in this &s;tate, I felt my&s;elf greatly and unexpectedly relieved one Sunday morning, by a &s;ermon which I happened to hear from our pari&s;h-mini&s;ter, on the following text&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you and per|&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil of you <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> for my &s;ake, for great is your reward in hea|ven." The excellent di&s;cour&s;e which this pious man delivered on the&s;e words was &s;o exactly &s;uited to my circum&s;tances and feelings, that it &s;eemed as if it had been addre&s;&s;ed &s;olely to me; and it plea&s;ed God
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;o to apply what had been &s;aid to my heart and un|der&s;tanding, that I not only determined to bear in <HI>future</HI> the &s;neers and &s;coffs of my fellow &s;ervants with patience and fortitude, but even tho&s;e very &s;neers which I formerly con&s;idered as my heavie&s;t calamity, were now no longer grievous. From this time, therefore, my unea&s;ine&s;s was pretty well at an end. And I earne&s;tly recommend it to all other &s;ervants, who have been &s;o happy as to acquire &s;ober and virtuous habits, not to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be laughed out of their &s;obriety and virtue by the je&s;ts and ridicule of their fellow &s;ervants. They may depend upon it that their cau&s;e is a good one, and though they &s;uffer for it at fir&s;t, they will finally triumph. In a &s;hort time all my per&s;ecution was at an end. "To be &s;ure," &s;aid the coachman one day to the cook, "Charles is a little too religious, but upon my word I don't think he is the wor&s;e for it. Mayhap it might be better for us if we were more like him. I don't &s;ee but that he is as humble, friendly, and worthy a fellow as any among&s;t us. For my part I &s;hall laugh at him no longer." This &s;peech, which I happened accidentally to overhear, gave me great plea&s;ure, and I &s;oon found by the agree|able change in my fellow &s;ervants' conduct towards me, that the coachman had expre&s;&s;ed the opinion of the whole hall. It is true I did every thing to obtain their good-will that lay in my power. I was as civil and obliging to every one among them as I po&s;&s;ibly could. Was any thing to be done? If nobody el&s;e would do it, I never &s;topped to con|&s;ider whether it belonged to my place or not, but did it out of hand. If any body took it into his head to fall out with me, I generally di&s;armed him of his wrath by &s;aying nothing. If any little quar|rels or misfortunes, or mi&s;conduct, happened in the hall, I always endeavoured to hu&s;h it up, and never
<PB N="12" REF="12">
carried any tales to the ma&s;ter, unle&s;s when I &s;aw any body wronging him, and then I thought it my duty, or unle&s;s the thing was very bad indeed. In &s;hort, by pur&s;uing always this line of conduct, I found my &s;ituation very comfortable and agreeable. My ma&s;ter treated me with great confidence and kindne&s;s; my fellow &s;ervants with great friendline&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In about two years time, the footman that u&s;ed to go to market being turned away for drunkenne&s;s, which vice &s;oon proved his ruin, my ma&s;ter told me, that as he believed I was an hone&s;t and careful young man, and perceiving that I could write and keep an account, he &s;hould in future em|ploy me in marketing. To market, therefore, I went every day, and as I had now a good deal of my ma&s;ter's money always in my hands, I prayed heartily to God that he would be plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me under the temptation to which this expo&s;ed me. My fir&s;t exploit in this way was the purcha&s;e of ten &s;hillings worth of fruit at a fruiterer's. When I had fini&s;hed my bargain and was coming out of the &s;hop, the fruiterer &s;lipped a &s;hilling into my hand. As I had never, to the be&s;t of my recollection, &s;een him before, I was &s;omewhat &s;urrpized at his genero&s;ity; but fortunately had the pre&s;ence of mind to a&s;k him whether he had charged his fruit the higher on ac|count of this pre&s;ent to me. "Why young man," &s;aid he, "that is an hone&s;t que&s;tion, and I will give you an hone&s;t an&s;wer. The fact is, that as we know that gentlemen of your cloth expect &s;ome compli|ment from the trade&s;men they deal with, we are ob|liged in our own defence, to charge our articles the higher on that account to their ma&s;ters." "And &s;o," &s;aid I, "the money you give us, comes finally from the pockets of our ma&s;ters?" "To be &s;ure it does." "Why, then," &s;aid I, "I will take your &s;hilling, but &s;hall charge my ma&s;ter only nine &s;hillings." And this

method I con&s;tantly pur&s;ued in the like ca&s;e ever after; for I think the above-mentioned practice of footmen, which however I hope is not very com|mon with them, is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing in con&s;cience as if they &s;hould rob their ma&s;ter's bureau.</P>
<P>One Monday morning, having &s;ettled my account for the la&s;t week with my ma&s;ter, I found that he had made a mi&s;take again&s;t him&s;elf of twenty &s;hil|lings. As &s;oon as I di&s;covered it, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, here now is an opportunity of getting twenty &s;hil|lings without any ri&s;k or detection; but God forbid that I &s;hould do it, as it would ruin my peace of mind, and de&s;troy my &s;oul. I therefore pointed out the error to my ma&s;ter the fir&s;t opportunity,&mdash;"Charles," &s;aid he, "you are right, the mi&s;take is obvious, I acknowledge I made it purpo&s;ely to try your hone&s;ty. You &s;hall find that this affair will turn out, before long, to your advantage." Now, though I do not think it quite fair for ma&s;ters to lay this kind of trap for their &s;ervants integrity, yet as I know by experience they &s;ometimes do it, we mu&s;t be doubly on our guard. Indeed, di&s;hone&s;ty is never &s;afe. It always will out &s;ome how or other, I have &s;een &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of the di&s;covery of it, when it &s;eemed to have been committed with &s;uch cunning as to be impo&s;&s;ible to be detected.</P>
<P>One day, as I was going to market, I met Sir Ro|bert S.'s butler, who told me, that having long ob|&s;erved my &s;obriety and diligence, he was happy to have it now in his power to offer me a place in his ma&s;ter's family, where my wages would be rai&s;ed two guineas a year. I thanked him, and told him he &s;hould have his an&s;wer next evening. In the mean time, I called upon a pious and worthy friend, whom I con&s;ulted in all difficulties, and a&s;ked his opinion. After mature deliberation, he &s;aid, "Charles, don't go. When you are once got into a good place
<PB N="14" REF="14">
&s;tick to it like a leech. The rolling &s;tone gets no mo&s;s. The more years you continue in one &s;ervice&punc; the more you are re&s;pected by your ma&s;ter and all the world. A good family con&s;iders an old &s;ervant as one of them&s;elves, and can no more &s;ee him want than a near relation. Whereas &s;ervants that are con|tinually roving from place to place, have no friend in di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eldom get a provi&s;ion for old age." Happy it was for me that I followed this good ad|vice. If I had not, I &s;hould probably have been nothing more than a poor footman all my life.</P>
<P>But before I bring my own &s;tory to an end, I mu&s;t beg my reader's patience, to li&s;ten to the &s;ad fate of my poor brother Tom. Alas! poor Tom, he was a great favourite in our kitchen, becau&s;e he &s;ung the be&s;t &s;ong, and told the merrie&s;t tale, and paid his card money the mo&s;t freely of any gentleman footman about town. And then he &s;wore &s;o much like a gentleman, and was &s;o complai&s;ant to the ladies, and pu&s;hed about the &s;trong beer &s;o merrily, that he was, &s;aid our &s;ervants, the mo&s;t agreeable company in the world. And yet all the&s;e entertain|ing qualities did not pre&s;erve my poor brother from the mo&s;t dreadful &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s and ruin. One morning he came to me about ten o'clock with a very woeful face, which was a thing very unu&s;ual for him, and told me, that he had ju&s;t been turned away from his place without a character, that he had no money, many debts, and no <HI>real</HI> friends, and what was wor&s;e than all, that he was labouring under di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tom grew wor&s;e every day, and was at length given over. In the morning of that day, while I was &s;it|&s;itting at his bed&s;ide, who &s;hould come in but my dear mother. She had walked 130 miles, except now and then a lift in the waggon, to attend upon and comfort her unde&s;erving &s;on. When &s;he &s;aw him, pale and emaciated, and his face half con&s;umed by
<PB N="15" REF="15">
di&s;ea&s;e, it &s;o &s;hocked her, that &s;he fainted away. As &s;oon as &s;he recovered, and was a little relieved by a plentiful flood of tears, &s;he &s;aid, "my dear Tom, I am come to take care of thee and make thee better, if I can." "Alas! mother," an&s;wered he, putting his clay-cold hand into her's, "it is all too late. I have but a few hours to live. It is by neglecting your advice that I am brought to this. Gaming, and drink, and bad company, and bad women have been my ruin, O! what will become of my &s;oul! If I could but live my life over again&mdash;Here he was &s;eized with a &s;udden &s;it, and though he lived &s;ome hours, he never &s;poke after, and died that evening in my mother's arms.</P>
<P>After recounting the &s;orrowful hi&s;tory of my unhap|py brother, I mu&s;t now ha&s;ten to conclude my own. About a twelvemonth after the offer of a place in Sir Robert S&mdash;'s family, my ma&s;ter, in con&s;ideration, as he &s;aid, of my faithful &s;ervices, made me his butler. He was indeed &s;o kind and friendly to me on all oc|ca&s;ions; that I found it nece&s;&s;ary to be extremely cautious left I &s;hould grow proud, or &s;aucy, or fa|miliar, which &s;ome &s;ervants, when they have lived long in a place, and find them&s;elves in favour, are apt to do. After enjoying this po&s;t about &s;ix years, our family being now removed into the country, I made acquaintance with a farmer's daughter living near the great hou&s;e, whom, on account of her re|ligious and indu&s;trious principles and her amiable and cheerful temper, I wi&s;hed to make my wife. She was no flaunter in fine clothes, none of your dancing, flirting, forward la&s;&s;es, that run about to chri&s;tenings, and revels, and hops, that will ruin a man before he knows where he is; but a pious, &s;o|ber, &s;tay-at-home, indu&s;trious young woman; el&s;e I am &s;ure any body might have had her for me. As I had never been guilty of any unnece&s;&s;ary expence,
<PB N="16" REF="16">
for nobody will call that unnece&s;&s;ary which I &s;ent yearly to my parents, my &s;avings, the intere&s;t be|ing added yearly to the principal in the hands of my ma&s;ter amounted to two hundred pounds. And as Fanny's father promi&s;ed to give her another hun|dred, I thought we might with this take a &s;mall farm, and maintain our&s;elves comfortably and decently. I therefore communicated the affair to my ma&s;ter. "Charles," &s;aid he, "though I am loth to part with &s;o good a &s;ervant, yet I think it an act of gratitude due to you for your long and faithful &s;ervices, to con&s;ent readily to any thing which may be for your welfare. But I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary for us to part at all. I am at pre&s;ent in want of a bailiff. You may, if you approve it, undertake that office, and &s;till retain your pre&s;ent wages. Your father-in-law, who is an experienced farmer, will in&s;truct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the duties of it. I will, be&s;ides, let you a &s;mall farm on an advantageous lea&s;e, which you may may make the mo&s;t of for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>To this kind and generous offer I joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully a&s;|&s;ented. And Fanny and my&s;elf have now lived to|gether &s;ix years in the farm-hou&s;e near the park-gate, happy and pro&s;perous. My father being dead, and my brother and &s;i&s;ter &s;ettled, my mother, who is now very old, lives with me; and by her example and exhortation I find a &s;en&s;e of religion &s;ink deeper and deeper into my &s;oul everyday; and indeed I am firmly convinced by long experience, that there is no|thing in this world can make us truly happy but that.</P>
<P>I addre&s;s this little book, which I wrote by little and little in the long evenings of the la&s;t hard win|ter, to all footmen. I hope they will not be angry with my well-meant endeavours, but take kindly what is intended only for their good.</P>
