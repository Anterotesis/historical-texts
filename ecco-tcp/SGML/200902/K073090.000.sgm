AN ENQUIRY INTO THE PRESENT STATE OF POLITE LEARNING.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;o long the practice to repre|&s;ent literature as declining, that every renewal of this complaint now comes with dimini&s;h'd influence. The publick has been often excited by a fal&s;e alarm, &s;o that at pre|&s;ent the nearer we approach the threatned period of decay, the more our fatal &s;ecurity increa&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9">
TO deplore the pro&s;titution of learning, and de&s;pi&s;e cotemporary merit, it mu&s;t be owned, have too often been the re&s;ource of the envious or di&s;appointed, the dictates of re&s;entment not impartiality. The writer, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fame, is willing to enjoy it with|out a rival, by le&s;&s;ening every competitor; the un&s;ucce&s;sful author is de&s;irous to turn upon others the contempt which is levelled at him&s;elf, and being convicted at the bar of literary ju&s;tice, vainly hopes for pardon by accu&s;ing every brother of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SENSIBLE of this; the writer of the fol|lowing e&s;&s;ay is at a lo&s;s where to find an apology for his conduct, in &s;till per&s;i&s;ting to arraign the merit of the age; for joining in a cry which the judicious have long &s;ince left to be kept up by the vulgar, and for adopting the &s;entiments of the multitude
<PB N="3" REF="10">
in a performance that at be&s;t can plea&s;e only the Few.</P>
<P>COMPLAINTS of our degeneracy in litera|ture as well as in morals, I own have been frequently exhibited of late; but &s;eem to be enforced more with the ardour of devious declamation, than the calmne&s;s of delibe|rate enquiry. The dulle&s;t critic, who &s;trives at a reputation for delicacy, by &s;hew|ing he cannot be plea&s;ed, may pathetically a&s;&s;ure us that our ta&s;te is upon the decline, may con&s;ign every modern performance to oblivion, and bequeath nothing to po&s;terity except the labours of our ance&s;tors, and his own. Such general invective, however, con|veys no in&s;truction; all it teaches is, that the writer di&s;likes an age by which he is proba|bly di&s;regarded. The manner of being u&s;e|ful on the &s;ubject would be to point out the &s;ymptoms, to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es, and
<PB N="4" REF="11">
direct to the remedies of the approaching decay. This is a &s;ubject hitherto unat|tempted in critici&s;m, perhaps it is the only &s;ubject in which critici&s;m can be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>TO mark out, therefore, the corruptions that have found way into the republick of letters, to attempt the re&s;cuing of genius from the &s;hackles of pedantry and critici&s;m, to di&s;tingui&s;h the decay, naturally con&s;equent on an age like ours grown old in literature, from every erroneous innovation which admits a remedy, to take a view of tho&s;e &s;ocieties which profe&s;s the advancement of polite learning, and by a mutual oppo&s;ition of their excellencies and defects to attempt the improvement of each, is the de&s;ign of this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>HOW far the writer is equal to &s;uch an undertaking the reader mu&s;t determine; but
<PB N="5" REF="12">
this may be a&s;&s;erted without the imputation of vanity, that he enters the li&s;ts with no di&s;appointments to bia&s;s his judgment, nor will he ever reprove but with a de&s;ire to reform. The defects of his execution may be compen&s;ated by the u&s;efulne&s;s of his de|&s;ign, his ob&s;ervations may be ju&s;t, tho' his manner of expre&s;&s;ing them &s;hould only &s;erve as an example of the errors he under|takes to reprove.</P>
<P>IF the pre&s;ent enquiry were a topick of &s;peculative curio&s;ity, calculated to fill up a few vacant moments in literary indolence, I &s;hould think my labour ill be&s;towed. To rank in the &s;ame de&s;picable cla&s;s with the di&s;&s;ertations, aenigma's, problems, and other periodical compilations with which even idlene&s;s is cloyed at pre&s;ent, is by no means my ambition. True learning and true morality are clo&s;ely connected; to im|prove
<PB N="6" REF="13">
the head will in&s;en&s;ibly influence the heart, a deficiency of ta&s;te and a corrup|tion of manners are &s;ometimes found mutu|ally to produce each other.</P>
<P>DISSENTING from received opinions may frequently render this e&s;&s;ay liable to correc|tion, yet the reader may be a&s;&s;ured that a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ingularity never gives ri&s;e to the error. Novelty is not permitted to u&s;urp the place of rea&s;on; it may attend, but &s;hall not conduct the enquiry. The more original however any performance is, the more it is liable to deviate; for cautious &s;tupidity is always in the right. In literature as in commerce the value of the acqui&s;ition is generally proportioned to the hazard of the adventure. I &s;hall think therefore with freedom, and bear correction with candour. It is but ju&s;t that he who di&s;&s;ents from others
<PB N="7" REF="14">
&s;hould not be di&s;plea&s;ed if others differ from him. The applau&s;e of a few, a very few, will &s;atisfy ambition, and even ill-nature mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have been willing to ad|vance the reputation of the age at the hazard of my own.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the decline of ancient learning.</HEAD>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the revolutions which have happened in the common wealth of letters, &s;urvey the rapid progre&s;s of learn|ing in one period of antiquity, or its amazing decline in another, we &s;hall be al|mo&s;t induc'd to accu&s;e nature of partiality, as if &s;he had exhau&s;ted all her efforts in adorning one age, while &s;he left the &s;ucceed|ing entirely neglected. It is not to nature, however, but to our&s;elves alone that this partiality mu&s;t be a&s;crib'd; the &s;eeds of ex|cellence are &s;own in every age, and it is wholly owing to a wrong direction in the pa&s;&s;ions or pur&s;uits of mankind that they have not received the proper cultivation. It is not nature that is fatigued with pro|ducing
<PB N="9" REF="16">
her wonders &s;o much as we that are &s;atiated with admiration.</P>
<P>AS in the be&s;t regulated &s;ocieties, the very laws which at fir&s;t give the govern|ment &s;olidity, may in the end contribute to its di&s;&s;olution, &s;o the efforts which might have promoted learning in its feeble com|mencement may, if continued, retard its progre&s;s. The paths of &s;cience which were at fir&s;t intricate becau&s;e untrodden, may at la&s;t grow toil&s;ome becau&s;e too much frequented. As learning advances, the candidates for its honours may become more numerous, and the acqui&s;ition of fame more uncertain; the mode&s;t may de&s;pair of attaining it, and the opulent think it too precarious to pur&s;ue; thus the ta&s;k of &s;upporting the honour of the times may at la&s;t devolve on indigence and
<PB N="10" REF="17">
effrontery, and learning partake the con|tempt of its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions it may be proper to take a &s;light review of the decline of ancient learning; to con&s;ider how far its depravation was owing to the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting continued perfection; in what re&s;pects it proceeded from voluntary cor|ruption; and how far it was ha&s;tened on by accidental event. If Modern learning be compared with Ancient in the&s;e different lights, a parallel between both, which has hi|therto produced only vain di&s;pute, may con|tribute to amu&s;ement, perhaps, in&s;truction. We &s;hall thus be enabled to perceive what period of antiquity the pre&s;ent age mo&s;t re&s;embles, whether we are making advances towards excellence or retiring again to pri|meval ob&s;curity; we &s;hall, by their exam|ple,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
be taught to acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e defects which it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent; and reject all faulty innovations tho' offered under the &s;pecious titles of improvement.</P>
<P>IN early ages when man was employed in acquiring nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, or in defend|ing his acqui&s;itions, when without laws or &s;ociety he led a precarious life, while even the &s;avage rivalled him in the dominion of the fore&s;t; in &s;uch times of fatigue and dark|ne&s;s we mu&s;t not look for the origin of arts or learning, which are the offspring of &s;ecu|rity, opulence and ea&s;e. When experience taught the advantages of &s;ociety, when na|tive freedom was exchanged for &s;ocial &s;ecu|rity, when man began to feel the benefit of laws, and the mind had lei&s;ure for the con|templation of nature and it&s;elf, then, pro|bably, the &s;ciences might have been culti|vated
<PB N="12" REF="19">
to add &s;trength to the ri&s;ing com|munity, and the polite arts introduced to promote its enjoyments.</P>
<P>LEARNING, when planted in any coun|try, is tran&s;ient and fading, nor does it flouri&s;h till &s;low gradations of improve|ment have naturalized it to the &s;oil. It makes feeble advances, begins among the vulgar, and ri&s;es into reputation among the great. It cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a &s;tate at once, by introducing the learned of other countries; the&s;e may grace a court, but &s;eldom enlighten a kingdom. Ptolemy Philadelphus, Con&s;tantine Por|phyriogeneta, Alfred, or Charlemagne, might have invited learned foreigners in|to their dominions, but could not e&s;tabli&s;h learning. While in the radiance of royal favour, every art and &s;cience &s;eemed to
<PB N="13" REF="20">
flouri&s;h, but when that was withdrawn, they quickly felt the rigours of a &s;trange climate, and with exotic con&s;titutions pe|ri&s;hed by neglect.</P>
<P>As the arts and &s;ciences are &s;low in com|ing to maturity, it is requi&s;ite in order to their perfection, that the &s;tate &s;hould be permanent, which gives them reception. There are numberle&s;s attempts without &s;uc|ce&s;s, and experiments without conclu&s;ion, between the fir&s;t rudiments of an art, and its utmo&s;t perfection, between the outlines of a &s;hadow, and the picture of an Apel|les. Lei&s;ure is required to go through the tedious interval, to join the experience of predece&s;&s;ors to our own, or enlarge our views, by building on the ruined attempts of former adventurers. All this may be performed in a &s;ociety of long continuance;
<PB N="14" REF="21">
but if the kingdom be but of &s;hort dura|tion, as was the ca&s;e of Arabia, learning &s;eems coeval, &s;ympathizes with its politi|cal &s;truggles, and is annihilated in its di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
<P>BUT permanence in a &s;tate, is not alone &s;ufficient, it is requi&s;ite al&s;o for this end that it &s;hould be free. Naturali&s;ts a&s;&s;ure us, that all animals are &s;agacious in propor|tion as they are removed from the tyran|ny of others; in native liberty, the ele|phant is a citizen, and the beaver, an ar|chitect; but whenever the tyrant man in|trudes upon their community, their &s;pirit is broken, they &s;eem anxious only for &s;afety, and their intellects &s;uffer an equal diminu|tion with their pro&s;perity. The parallel will hold with regard to mankind; fear na|turally repre&s;&s;es invention, benevolence,
<PB N="15" REF="22">
ambition; for in a nation of &s;laves, as in the de&s;potic governments of the ea&s;t, to labour after fame is to be a candidate for danger.</P>
<P>FOR a &s;tate to attain literary excellence, be&s;ides, it is requi&s;ite, that the &s;oil and cli|mate &s;hould, as much as po&s;&s;ible, conduce to happine&s;s. The earth mu&s;t &s;upply man with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, before he has lei&s;ure, or inclination, to pur&s;ue its more re|fined enjoyments. The climate al&s;o mu&s;t be equally indulgent, for, in too warm a region, the mind is relaxed into languors, and by the oppo&s;ite exce&s;s, is chilled into torpid inactivity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal advantages which tend to the improvement of learning. En|couragement from the Great is u&s;eful in pre|venting its decline.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">
THOSE who behold the phaenomena of na|ture, and content them&s;elves with the view without enquiring into their cau&s;es, are per|haps wi&s;er than is generally imagined. In this manner our rude ance&s;tors were acquaint|ed with facts, and Poetry, which helped the imagination, and the memory was thought the mo&s;t proper vehicle for conveying their knowledge to po&s;terity. It was the poet, who harmonized the ungrateful accents of his native dialect, who lifted it above common conver&s;ation, and &s;haped its rude combi|nations into order. From him the orator formed a &s;tile, and though poetry fir&s;t ro&s;e out of pro&s;e, in turn, it gave birth to every pro&s;aic excellence. Mu&s;ical period, con|ci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion, and delicacy of &s;entiment, were all excellencies derived from the poet; in &s;hort, he not only preceded, but formed the orator, philo&s;opher, and hi&s;torian.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">
WHEN the ob&s;ervations of pa&s;t ages were collected, philo&s;ophy began to examine their cau&s;es. She had numberle&s;s facts from which to draw proper inferences, and poetry had taught her the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion to enforce them. The Greeks, (for we know little of the Egyptian learning) now exerted all their happy talents in the inve&s;tigation of truth, and the production of beauty. Before this, the works of art were remarkable only for the va&s;tne&s;s of de&s;ign, and &s;eemed the productions of giants, not of ordinary men; learning was another name for magic, or to give it its real ap|pellation, impo&s;ture. But tho&s;e improvers &s;aw there was more excellence in capti|vating the judgment, than in rai&s;ing a momentary a&s;toni&s;hment: in their arts they imitated only &s;uch parts of nature, as might plea&s;e in the repre&s;entation; in the &s;ciences,
<PB N="18" REF="25">
they cultivated &s;uch parts of knowlege, as it was every man's duty to be acquaint|ed with. Unity, variety, and proportion, charmed in all their de&s;igns; liberty, pa|trioti&s;m, and a &s;ubjection to the laws were, what all their true philo&s;ophers &s;trove to inculcate. Thus learning was encouraged, protected, honoured, and in its turn, it adorned, &s;trengthened and harmonized the community.</P>
<P>FROM being the di&s;ciple of Greece, Rome &s;oon became its rival, and was as much e&s;teemed for its improvements in the arts of peace, as feared for its atchieve|ments in tho&s;e of war. The Romans un|der&s;tood, perhaps, better than their ma&s;ters, the manner of blending art and &s;cience for their mutual improvement. By this means their philo&s;ophy acquired more grace, and
<PB N="19" REF="26">
their poetry more &s;entiment. They entire|ly bani&s;hed that magical ob&s;curity, which the Greeks fir&s;t borrowed from other na|tions, and &s;ome part of which, their mo&s;t admired writers thought proper &s;till to re|tain. The learning of the Romans might ju&s;tly be &s;tiled, the true&s;t refinement on common &s;en&s;e, it was therefore, a proper in&s;trument in the hands of ambition. Their mo&s;t powerful men, not only encouraged, but became them&s;elves, the fine&s;t models of literary perfection. Thus the arts and &s;ciences went on together, and rea&s;oning proceeded no farther, than where experi|ment pointed out the way.</P>
<P>BUT as the operations of body are &s;low, tho&s;e of the mind vigorous and active, as experiment is dilatory and painful, &s;pecula|tion quick and amu&s;ing, the &s;pirit of phi|lo&s;ophy
<PB N="20" REF="27">
being excited, the rea&s;oner, when de&s;|titute of experiment, had recour&s;e to theory, and gave up what was u&s;eful for refinement.</P>
<P>CRITICS, &s;ophi&s;ts, grammarians, rheto|ricians, and commentators, now began to figure in the literary commonwealth. In the dawn of &s;cience, &s;uch are generally mo|de&s;t, and not entirely u&s;ele&s;s; their perfor|mances &s;erve to mark the progre&s;s of learn|ing, tho' they &s;eldom contribute to its im|provement. But as nothing but labour is required in making proficients, in their re|&s;pective departments; &s;o neither the &s;atyr, nor the contempt of the wi&s;e, though So|crates was of the number, nor the laws le|velled at them by the &s;tate, though Cato was in the legi&s;lature, could prevent their approaches. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the advanta|ges of unfeeling dullne&s;s, laborious, in&s;en|&s;ible,
<PB N="21" REF="28">
&s;hamele&s;s and per&s;evering, they &s;till proceeded mending, and mending every work of genius, or to &s;peak without irony, undermining all that was polite and u&s;eful. Libraries were crammed, but not enriched with their labours, while the fatigues of reading their explanatory comments was ten-fold that which might &s;uffice for un|der&s;tanding the original. Their works effectually encrea&s;ed our application, by profe&s;&s;ing to remove it.</P>
<P>AGAINST &s;o ob&s;tinate and irrefragable an enemy, what could avail the un&s;upport|ed &s;allies of genius, or the oppo&s;ition of tran&s;itory re&s;entment? In &s;hort, they con|quered by per&s;evering, claimed the right of dictating upon every work of ta&s;te, &s;en|timent, or genius, and at la&s;t, when de&s;ti|tute of other employment, like the &s;uper|numerary
<PB N="22" REF="29">
dome&s;tics of the great, made work for each other.</P>
<P>THEY now took upon them to teach poetry, to tho&s;e who wanted genius, and the power of di&s;puting, to tho&s;e who knew nothing of the &s;ubject in debate. It was ob&s;erved, how &s;ome of the mo&s;t admired poets had copied nature. From the&s;e, they collected dry rules, dignified with long names, and &s;uch were obtruded upon the public for their improvement. Common &s;en&s;e would be apt to &s;ugge&s;t, that the art might be &s;tudied to more advantage, rather by imitation than precept. It might &s;ugge&s;t, that tho&s;e rules were collected, not from nature, but a copy of nature, and would con&s;equently give us &s;till fainter re&s;emblances of original beauty. It might &s;till &s;ugge&s;t, that explained wit, makes but a feeble impre&s;&s;ion, that the ob&s;er|vations
<PB N="23" REF="30">
of others, are &s;oon forgotten, tho&s;e, made by our&s;elves, are permanent and u&s;e|ful. But, it &s;eems, under&s;tandings of every &s;ize were to be mechanically in&s;tructed in poetry. If the reader was too dull to re|li&s;h the beauties of Virgil, the comment of Servius was ready to brighten his ima|gination; if Terence could not rai&s;e him to a &s;mile, Evantius was at hand, with a long-winded &s;cholium to encrea&s;e his titil|lation. Such rules are calculated to make blockheads talk, but all the lemmata of the Lyceum are unable to give him feeling.</P>
<P>THEIR logical di&s;putations &s;eemed even to be the apotheo&s;is of folly. In the&s;e the opponent had a right to affirm, whatever ab&s;urdity he thought proper. The defen|dant, though he &s;aw the fal&s;hood almo&s;t by intuition, was not allowed to u&s;e his
<PB N="24" REF="31">
rea&s;on, but his art, in the debate. It was his bu&s;ine&s;s only to mea&s;ure the a&s;&s;ertion by one of his artificial in&s;truments, and as it happen|ed to accord, or di&s;agree, he found him&s;elf qualified to &s;upport, or obliged to di&s;conti|nue, his defence; which &s;eldom, however, happened, till fatigue or anger terminated the enquiry.</P>
<P>But it would be endle&s;s to recount all the in&s;ect-like ab&s;urdities, which were hatched in the &s;chools of tho&s;e &s;pecious idlers; be it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that they encrea&s;ed as learning improved, but &s;warmed on its decline. It was then, that every work of ta&s;te was buried in long comments, every u&s;eful &s;ubject in mo|rals, was di&s;tingui&s;hed away into ca&s;ui&s;try, and doubt and &s;ubtilty characterized the learning of the age. Metrodorus, Valeri|us
<PB N="25" REF="32">
Probus, Aulus Gellius, Pedianus, Boe|thius, and an hundred others, to be ac|quainted with whom, might &s;hew much reading, and but little judgment; the&s;e, I &s;ay, made choice each of an author, and delivered all their load of learning on his back; &s;hame to our ance&s;tors, many of their works have reached our times entire, while Tacitus him&s;elf has &s;uffered mutilation.</P>
<P>In a word, the commonwealth of li|terature, was at la&s;t wholly overrun by the&s;e &s;tudious triflers. Men of real ge|nius, were lo&s;t in the multitude, or, as in a world of fools, it were folly to aim at being an only exception, obliged to con|form to every prevailing ab&s;urdity of the times. Original productions &s;eldom ap|peared, and learning, as if grown &s;upera|nuated, be&s;towed all its panegyric upon
<PB N="26" REF="33">
the vigour of its youth, and turned enco|mia&s;t upon its former atchievements.</P>
<P>IT is to the&s;e, then, that the depravation of ancient polite learning, is principally to be a&s;cribed. By them it was &s;eparated from common &s;en&s;e, and made the proper employment of &s;peculative idlers. Men bred up among books, and &s;eeing nature only by reflection, could do little, except hunt after perplexity and confu&s;ion. The public, therefore, with rea&s;on rejected learn|ing, when thus rendered barren, though voluminous, for we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the generality of mankind never lo&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion for letters, while they continue to be either amu&s;ing or u&s;eful.</P>
<P>IT was &s;uch writers as the&s;e, that ren|dered learning unfit for uniting and &s;trength|ening
<PB N="27" REF="34">
civil &s;ociety, or for promoting the views of ambition. True philo&s;ophy had kept the Graecian &s;tates cemented into one effective body, more than any law for that purpo&s;e; and the Etrurian philo&s;ophy, which prevailed in the fir&s;t ages of Rome, in&s;pired tho&s;e patriot virtues, which paved the way to univer&s;al empire. But by the labours of commentators, when philo&s;o|phy became ab&s;tru&s;e, or triflingly minute, when doubt was pre&s;ented in&s;tead of know|ledge, when the orator was taught to charm the multitude with the mu&s;ic of his pe|riods, and pronounced a declamation, that might be &s;ung as well as &s;poken, and often upon &s;ubjects wholly fictitious; in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, learning was entirely un&s;uited to all the purpo&s;es of government, or the de&s;igns of the ambitious. As long as the &s;ciences could influence the &s;tate, and its
<PB N="28" REF="35">
politics were &s;trengthened by them, &s;o long did the community give them countenance and protection. But the wi&s;er part of man|kind would not be impo&s;ed upon by unin|telligible jargon, nor, like the knight in Pantagruel, &s;wallow a chimera for a break|fa&s;t, though even cooked by Ari&s;totle. As the philo&s;opher grew u&s;ele&s;s in the &s;tate, he al&s;o became contemptible. In the times of Lucian, he was chiefly remarkable for his avarice, his impudence, and his beard.</P>
<P>UNDER the au&s;picious influence of genius, arts and &s;ciences grew up to|gether, and mutually illu&s;trated each other. But when once Pedants became law|givers, the &s;ciences began to want grace, and the polite arts &s;olidity; the&s;e grew crabbed and &s;owre, tho&s;e meretrici|ous and gawdy; the philo&s;opher became
<PB N="29" REF="36">
di&s;gu&s;tingly preci&s;e, and the poet, ever &s;training after grace, caught only finery.</P>
<P>The&s;e men al&s;o contributed to ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of wi&s;dom, by addicting their readers to one particular &s;ect, or &s;ome fa|vourite &s;cience. They generally carried on a petty traffic in &s;ome little creek; within that they bu&s;ily plied about, and drove an in&s;ignificant trade; but never ventured out into the great ocean of knowlege, nor went beyond the bounds that chance, con|ceit, or lazine&s;s had fir&s;t pre&s;cribed their enquiries. Their di&s;ciples, in&s;tead of aim|ing at being originals them&s;elves, became imitators of that merit alone, which was con&s;tantly propo&s;ed for their admiration. In exerci&s;es of this kind, the mo&s;t &s;tupid are generally mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; for there is not
<PB N="30" REF="37">
in nature, a more imitative animal than a dunce.</P>
<P>FROM hence ancient learning may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three periods. Its com|mencement, or the age of poets; its ma|turity, or the age of philo&s;ophers; and its decline, or the age of critics. In the com|mencement of learning, commentators were very few, but might have, in &s;ome re|&s;pects, been u&s;eful. In its maturity, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become obnoxi|ous, yet, as if the nearer we approached perfection, the more we &s;tood in need of their directions, in this period they began to grow numerous. But when polite learn|ing was no more, then it was tho&s;e lite|rary lawgivers made the mo&s;t formidable appearance. <HI>Corrupti&s;&s;ima republica, plu|rimae leges.</HI> TACIT.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A view of the ob&s;cure ages.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER the &s;kill of any country may be in the &s;ciences, it is from its excellence in polite learn|ing alone, it mu&s;t expect a character from po&s;terity. The poet and the hi&s;torian, are they who diffu&s;e a lu&s;tre upon the age, and the philo&s;opher &s;carce acquires any applau&s;e, unle&s;s his character be introduced to the vulgar by their mediation.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;cure ages which &s;ucceeded the decline of the Roman empire, are a &s;trik|ing in&s;tance of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. Whatever period of tho&s;e ill-fated times we happen to turn to, we &s;hall perceive more &s;kill in the &s;ciences among the pro|fe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="32" REF="39">
of them, more ab&s;tru&s;e and deeper enquiry into every philo&s;ophical &s;ubject, and a greater &s;hew of &s;ubtilty and clo&s;e rea&s;oning, than in the mo&s;t enlightened ages of all antiquity. But their writings were mere &s;peculative amu&s;ements, and all their re&s;earches exhau&s;ted upon trifles. Un&s;kil|led in the arts of adorning their knowlege, or adapting it to common &s;en&s;e, their vo|luminous productions re&s;t peacefully in our libraries, or at be&s;t, are enquired after from motives of curio&s;ity, and not of learn|ing, not by the &s;cholar, but the virtuo&s;o.</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible, that &s;everal late French hi&s;torians, have exhibited the ob|&s;cure ages in a very different light; they have repre&s;ented them, as utterly ignorant both of arts and &s;ciences, buried in the profounde&s;t darkne&s;s, or only illuminated

with a feeble gleam, which, like an expir|ing taper, ro&s;e and &s;unk by intervals. Such a&s;&s;ertions, however, though they &s;erve to help out the declaimer, &s;hould be cauti|ou&s;ly admitted by the hi&s;torian. The tenth century is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by po&s;|terity, with the appellation of ob&s;cure. Yet even in this, the reader's memory may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t the names of &s;ome, who&s;e works, &s;till pre&s;erved, di&s;cover a mo&s;t exten&s;ive erudition, tho' rendered almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s by affectation and ob&s;curity. A few of their names and writings may be mention|ed, which will &s;erve at once to confirm what I a&s;&s;ert, and give the reader an idea of what kind of learning an age declining into ob&s;curity chiefly chu&s;es to cultivate.</P>
<P>ABOUT the tenth century, flouri&s;hed Leo the philo&s;opher. We have &s;even volumes
<PB N="34" REF="41">
folio of his collections of laws, publi&s;hed at Paris, 1647. He wrote upon the art military, and under&s;tood al&s;o a&s;tronomy, and judicial a&s;trology. He was &s;even times more voluminous than Plato.</P>
<P>SOLOMON, the German, wrote a mo&s;t elegant dictionary of the Latin tongue, &s;till pre&s;erved in the univer&s;ity of Louvain; Pantaleon, in the lives of his illu&s;trious countrymen, &s;peaks of it in the warme&s;t &s;trains of rapture. Dictionary writing was, at that time, much in fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>CONSTANTINE Porphyriogeneta, a man univer&s;ally &s;killed in the &s;ciences. His tracts on the admini&s;tration of an empire, on tactics, on laws, &amp;c. &amp;c. were publi&s;h|ed &s;ome years &s;ince at Leyden. His court, for he was emperor of the ea&s;t, was re|&s;orted
<PB N="35" REF="42">
to by the learned from all parts of the world.</P>
<P>LUITPRANDUS, a mo&s;t voluminous hi&s;|torian, particularly famous for the hi&s;tory of his own times. In this he &s;hews him|&s;elf a perfect <HI>matter of fact man,</HI> but, like &s;ome moderns, who only value them&s;elves on the &s;ame qualification, he was a mo&s;t notorious fabuli&s;t. The compliments paid him as a writer, are &s;aid to exceed even his own voluminous productions. I can|not pa&s;s over one of a latter date made him by a German divine. <HI>Luitprandus nun|quam Luitprando di&s;&s;imilis.</HI> In Engli&s;h, None but him&s;elf could be his parallel.</P>
<P>ALFRIC compo&s;ed &s;everal grammars and dictionaries &s;till pre&s;erved among the curious.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="43">
POPE Sylve&s;ter the eleventh, wrote a treati&s;e on the &s;phere, on arithmetic, and geometry, publi&s;hed &s;ome years &s;ince at Paris.</P>
<P>MICHAEL P&s;ellus lived in this age, who&s;e books in the &s;ciences, I will not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, contain more learning than tho&s;e of any one of the earlier ages of antiquity: his erudition was indeed amaz|ing, and he was as voluminous as he was learned. The character given him by Al|latius has, perhaps, more truth in it than will be granted by tho&s;e who have &s;een none of his productions. There was, &s;ays he, no &s;cience with which he was unac|quainted, none which he did not write &s;omething upon, and none which he did not leave better than he found it. To mention his works, would be endle&s;s.

His commentaries on Ari&s;totle alone a|mount to three folios.</P>
<P>BERTHOLDUS Teutonicus, a very volu|minous hi&s;torian. He was a politician, and wrote again&s;t the government; but mo&s;t of his writings, though not all, are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>CONSTANTINUS AFER, a philo&s;opher and phy&s;ician. We have remaining but two volumes folio of his philological perfor|mances. However, the hi&s;torian, who prefixes the life of the author to his wroks, &s;ays, that he wrote many more, as he kept on writing during the cour&s;e of a long life; and when he had thus compiled more than any man that ever went before him, he &s;ell a&s;leep. <HI>In domino obdormivit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45">
LAMBERTUS publi&s;hed an univer&s;al hi|&s;tory about this time, which has been printed at Francfort in folio. An univer|&s;al hi&s;tory in one folio! If he had con&s;ult|ed with his book&s;eller, he would have &s;pun it out to ten at lea&s;t; but Lambertus might have had too much mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>OLYMPIODORUS publi&s;hed commenta|ries upon Plato. Doctor Fo&s;ter, in his late edition of the &s;elect dialogues of that philo&s;opher, has often taken occa&s;ion to quote him, and mentions him with honour.</P>
<P>By this time, the reader perceives the &s;pirit of learning, which at that time pre|vailed. The ignorance of the age was not owing to a di&s;like of knowledge, but a fal&s;e &s;tandard of ta&s;te was erected, and a wrong direction given to philo&s;ophical

enquiry. It was the fa&s;hion of the day to con&s;ult books, not nature, and to eva|porate in a folio, the &s;pirit that could &s;carce have &s;ufficed for an epigram.

<P>I HAVE mentioned but a very incon&s;i|derable number of the writers in this age of ob&s;curity.

As, therefore, the writers of tho&s;e times are almo&s;t entirely forgotten, we may infer, that the number of publica|tions alone will never &s;ecure any age what&s;oever from oblivion. Nor can print|ing, contrary to what Mr. Baumelle has

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A parallel between the ri&s;e and decline of ancient and modern learning.</HEAD>
<P>FEW &s;ubjects have been more fre|quently and warmly debated, than the comparative &s;uperiority of the ancients and moderns. It is unaccountable how a di&s;pute, &s;o trifling, could be conte&s;ted with &s;o much virulence. A di&s;pute of this nature, could have no other con&s;e|quences, if decided, but to teach young writers to de&s;pi&s;e the one &s;ide or the other. A di&s;pute, therefore, which, if de|termined, might tend rather to prejudice our ta&s;te, than improve it, &s;hould have been argued with good nature, as it could not with &s;ucce&s;s. For mere critics to be guilty of &s;uch &s;chola&s;tic rage, is not un|common,
<PB N="42" REF="49">
but for men of the fir&s;t rank of fame to be delinquent al&s;o, is, I own, &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>THE reflecting reader need &s;carcely be informed, that this conte&s;ted excellence can be decided in favour of neither. They have both copied from different originals, de&s;cribed the manners of different ages, have exhibited nature as they found her, and both are excellent in &s;eparate imita|tions. Homer de&s;cribes his Gods as his countrymen believed them. Virgil, in a more enlightened age, de&s;cribes his with a greater degree of re&s;pect; and Milton &s;till ri&s;es infinitely above either. The ma|chinery of Homer is be&s;t adapted to an unenlightened idolator; that of the Roman poet, to a more refined heathen; and that of Milton, to a reader illuminated by re|velation.
<PB N="43" REF="50">
Had Homer wrote like Milton, his countrymen would have de&s;pi&s;ed him; had Milton adopted the theology of the ancient bard, he had been truly ridicu|lous. Again, &s;hould I depreciate Plautus for not enlivening his pieces with the characters of a coquet, or a marquis, &s;o humourous in modern comedy; or Moliere, for not introducing a legal bawd, or a para&s;itical boa&s;ter, &s;o highly fini&s;hed in the Roman poet; my cen&s;ure in either ca&s;e would be as ab&s;urd as his, who &s;hould di&s;like a geoprapher for not introducing more rivers, or promontories, into a coun|try, than nature had given it; or the natural hi&s;torian, for not enlivening his de&s;cription of a dead land&s;cape with a torrent, a ca|taract, or a volcano.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51">
THE parallel between antiquity and our &s;elves can thrrefore be managed to advantage only by comparing the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of ancient and modern learning together, &s;o that being appriz'd of the cau&s;es of cor|ruption in one, we may be upon our guard again&s;t any &s;imilar depravations in the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of polite learning in Italy.</HEAD>
<P>DANTE, who wrote in the 13th cen|tury, was the fir&s;t who attempted to bring learning from the cloi&s;ter into the com|munity, and paint human nature in a lan|guage adapted to modern manners. He ad|dre&s;&s;ed a barbarous people in a method &s;uited to their apprehen&s;ions; united purgatory and the river Styx, St. Peter and Virgil, heaven and hell together, and &s;hews a &s;trange mix|ture of good &s;en&s;e and ab&s;urdity. The truth is, he owes mo&s;t of his reputation to the ob&s;curity of the times in which he liv'd. As in the land of Benin a man may pa&s;s for a prodigy of parts who can read, &s;o in an age of barbarity a &s;mall degree of excellence en&s;ures &s;ucce&s;s. Be it his greate&s;t merit
<PB N="46" REF="53">
therefore to have lifted up the &s;tandard of nature, in &s;pite of all the oppo&s;ition and the per&s;ecution he received from cotemporary critici&s;m. To this &s;tandard every &s;ucceed|ing genius re&s;orted; the germ of every art and &s;cience began to unfold, and to imitate nature was found to be the &s;ure&s;t way of imitating antiquity. In a century or two after, modern Italy might ju&s;tly boa&s;t of rivalling ancient Rome; equal in &s;ome branches of polite learning, and not far &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed in others.</P>
<P>THEY &s;oon however fell from emulating the wonders of antiquity into &s;imple admi|ration. As if the word had been given when Vida and Ta&s;&s;o wrote on the arts of poetry, the whole &s;warm of critics was up; the Spe|roni's of the age attempted to be awkward|ly merry; and the virtuo&s;i and the Na&s;cotti
<PB N="47" REF="54">
&s;at upon the merits of every contemporary performance. After the age of Clement VII. the Italians &s;eem'd to think that there was more merit in prai&s;ing or cen&s;uring well, than in writing well; almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;e|quent performance being de&s;igned rather to &s;hew the excellence of their ta&s;te than their genius.</P>
<P>BUT while I de&s;cribe Italy as thus fallen from her former excellence, I cannot re&s;train the plea&s;ure of mentioning one or two poets who &s;eem born to redeem the honour of their country. Meta&s;ta&s;io has re&s;tored na|ture in all her beauteous &s;implicity: no poet ever painted more conformably to truth, nor is there any who&s;e characters &s;peak a more heart-felt pa&s;&s;ion. His language al&s;o, if a foreigner may be allowed to determine, ex|cells even that of Ta&s;&s;o, and his &s;cenery is
<PB N="48" REF="55">
infinitely &s;uperior. Maffei is the fir&s;t who has introduced a tragedy among his coun|try-men without a love-plot. Perhaps the Samp&s;on of Milton, and the Athalia of Racine, might have been his guides in &s;uch an attempt. Yet he &s;eems as much inferior to either as a poet, as the &s;ubject of his Merope is more happily cho&s;en.</P>
<P>TWO poets, however, in an age are not &s;ufficient to revive the &s;plendor of decaying genius; nor &s;hould we con&s;ider the few as the national &s;tandard, by which to characterize the many. Our mea&s;ures of li|terary reputation mu&s;t be taken rather from that numerous cla&s;s of men who, placed above the vulgar, are yet beneath the great, and who confer fame on others with|out receiving any portion of it them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">
IN Italy, then, we &s;hall no where find a &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion for art or &s;cience, yet no country making more feeble efforts to pro|mote either. The Virtuo&s;i and Filo&s;ofi &s;eem to have divided the Encyclopedia between each other. Both inviolably attach'd to their re&s;pective pur&s;uits, and from an oppo|&s;ition of character, each holding the other in the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt. The Vir|tuo&s;i profe&s;&s;ed critics of beauty in the works of art, judge of medals by the &s;mell, and the merit of a picture by feeling. In &s;tatuary hang over a fragment with the mo&s;t ardent gaze of admiration, tho' wanting the head and the other extremities, if dug from a ruin the <HI>Tor&s;e</HI> becomes ine&s;timable. An unintelligible monument of Etru&s;can barba|rity cannot be &s;ufficiently prized; and any thing from Herculanean becomes rapturous. When the intellectual ta&s;te is thus decayed,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
its reli&s;hes become fal&s;e, and, like that of &s;en&s;e, nothing will &s;atisfy, but what is be&s;t &s;uited to palliate or feed the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>POETRY is no longer among them the imitation of what we &s;ee, but of what a vi&s;ionary might wi&s;h. The zephyr breathes the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfume, the trees wear eternal verdure; fauns, and dryads, and hamadryads, &s;tand ready to fan the &s;ul|try &s;hepherde&s;s, who has forgot indeed the prettine&s;&s;es, with which former Italian &s;hepherde&s;&s;es have been reproached, but is &s;o &s;imple and innocent, as often to have no meaning. Happy country, where the pa&s;to|ral age begins to revive! Where the wits even of Rome are united into a rural groupe of nymphs and &s;wains, under the appellation of modern Arcadians. Where in the mid&s;t of porticos, proce&s;&s;ions, and cavalcades,
<PB N="51" REF="58">
abbes turn'd into &s;hepherds, and &s;hepherd|e&s;&s;es without &s;heep, indulge their inno|cent <HI>divertimenti.</HI> Perhaps, while I am writing, a &s;hepherde&s;s of three&s;core is li&s;tening to the pa&s;toral tale of a French abbe; a warm imagination might paint her in all the &s;plendor of ripened beauty, reclin|ed on a pa&s;te-board rock; might fancy her lover, with looks inexpre&s;&s;ibly tender, ravi&s;h|ing a ki&s;s from the &s;nowy &s;oftne&s;s of one of her hands, while the other holds a crook according to pa&s;toral decorum. Amid&s;t &s;uch frippery as this, there was no place for friendle&s;s Meta&s;ta&s;io; he has left Italy, and the genius of nature &s;eems to have left it with him.</P>
<P>THE Filo&s;ofi are entirely different from the former. As tho&s;e pretend to have
<PB N="52" REF="59">
got their knowlege from conver&s;ing with the living and polite, &s;o the&s;e boa&s;t of hav|ing theirs from books and &s;tudy. Bred up all their lives in colleges, they have there learned to think in track, &s;ervilely to follow the leader of their fect, and only to adopt &s;uch opinions, as their univer|&s;ities, or the inqui&s;ition, are plea&s;ed to allow. By this means, they are behind the re&s;t of Europe, in &s;everal modern improvements. Afraid to think for them|&s;elves; and univer&s;ities &s;eldom admit opi|nions as true, till univer&s;ally received a|mong the re&s;t of mankind. In &s;hort, were I to per&s;onize my ideas of learning in this country, I would either repre&s;ent it in the tawdry habits of the &s;tage, or el&s;e in the more homely gui&s;e of bearded &s;chool-philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60">
THE Germans early di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;ion for polite literature; but unhappily, like conquerors, who invading the dominions of others, leave their own to de&s;olation, in&s;tead of &s;tudying the German tongue, they wrote in Latin; thus, while they cul|tivated an ob&s;olete language, and vainly la|boured to apply it to modern cu&s;toms, they neglected their own. At the &s;ame time, they began al&s;o, by being commentators, and tho' they have given many in&s;tances of their in|du&s;try, they have &s;carce afforded any of ge|nius. If critici&s;m could have improved the ta&s;te of a people, the Germans would have been the mo&s;t polite nation alive. We &s;hall no where behold the learned wear a more im|portant appearance than here; no where more dignified with profe&s;&s;or&s;hips, or dre&s;&s;ed out in the fopperies of &s;chola&s;tic finery. However, they &s;eem to earn all the honours of this
<PB N="54" REF="61">
kind they enjoy. Their a&s;&s;iduity is un|parallelled; and did the learned of this country employ half tho&s;e hours on &s;tudy, which they be&s;tow on reading, we might be induced to pity, as well as prai&s;e, their painful preheminence. But guilty of a fault, too common to great readers, they write through volumes, while they do not think through a page. Never fatigued them|&s;elves, they think the reader can never be weary; &s;o they drone on, &s;aying all that can be &s;aid on the &s;ubject, not &s;electing what may be advanced to the purpo&s;e. Were angels to write books, they would never write folios.</P>
<P>BUT let the Germans have their due; if they are often a little dull, no nation alive a&s;&s;umes a more laudable &s;olemnity, or better under&s;tands all the little decorums
<PB N="55" REF="62">
of &s;tupidity. Let the di&s;cour&s;e of a pro|fe&s;&s;or run on never &s;o heavily, it cannot be irk&s;ome to his do&s;ing pupils, who fre|quently lend him their &s;ympathetic nods of approbation. I have &s;ometimes at|tended their di&s;putes at gradation. On this occa&s;ion, they often di&s;pen&s;e with learned gravity, and &s;eem really all alive. The di&s;putes are managed between the followers of Carte&s;ius, who&s;e exploded &s;y|&s;tem they call the new philo&s;ophy, and tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle. Though both parties are wrong, they argue with an ob&s;tinacy worthy the cau&s;e of truth; Nego, Probo, and Di&s;tinguo, grow loud. The di&s;pu|tants become warm, the moderator can|not be heard, the audience take part in the debate, till at la&s;t, the whole hall buzzes with erroneous philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63">
THERE are, it is true, &s;everal &s;ocieties in this country, which are chiefly calcu|lated to promote natural knowlege. The elector of Hanover has e&s;tabli&s;hed one at Gottingen, at an expence of not le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and pound. This uni|ver&s;ity has already pickled mon&s;ters, and di&s;&s;ected live puppies without number. Their tran&s;actions of this kind have been publi&s;hed in the learned world at proper intervals, &s;ince their in&s;titution; and will, it is hoped, one day give them a ju&s;t re|putation. Had the fourth part of the im|men&s;e &s;um above mentioned, been given in proper rewards to genius, in &s;ome neigh|bouring countries, it would have rendered the name of the donor immortal, and ad|ded to the real intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="64">
BUT let me cea&s;e from cen&s;ure, &s;ince I have here &s;o fine an opportunity of prai&s;e. Even in the mid&s;t of Germany, true learning has found an a&s;&s;ylum, and ta&s;te, and genius, have been patronized by a prince, who, in the humble&s;t &s;tation, had been the fir&s;t of mankind. The &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia at Ber|lin, is one of the fine&s;t literary in&s;titutions that any age or nation has produced. This academy comprehends all the &s;ciences under four different cla&s;&s;es; and although the object of each is different, and ad|mits of being &s;eparately treated, yet the&s;e cla&s;&s;es mutually influence the progre&s;s of each other, and concur in the &s;ame general de|&s;ign. Experimental philo&s;ophy, mathema|tics, metaphy&s;ics, and polite literature, are here carried on together, and mutually il|lu&s;trate, and &s;trengthen, and adorn each

other. The members are not collected from among the &s;tudents of &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;eminary, or the wits of a metropolis, but cho&s;en from all the literati of Europe, &s;upported by the bounty, and ornamented by the productions of their royal founder. We can ea&s;ily di&s;cern, how much &s;uch an in&s;titution excells any other now &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting. One fundamental error among &s;ocieties of this kind, is their addicting them&s;elves to one branch of &s;cience, or &s;ome particular part of polite learning. Thus, in Germany, there are no where &s;o many e&s;tabli&s;hments of this nature; but as they generally profe&s;s the promotion of natural or medical knowlege, he who reads their Acta, will only find an ob&s;cure far|rago of experiments, mo&s;t frequently ter|minated by no re&s;ulting phaenomena. To make experiments is, I own, the only way
<PB N="59" REF="66">
to promote natural knowlege; but to trea|&s;ure up every un&s;ucce&s;sful enquiry into nature, or to communicate every experi|ment without conclu&s;ion, is not to pro|mote &s;cience, but confu&s;e it; not to lift learning from ob&s;curity, but with additio|nal weight to oppre&s;s it. Had the mem|bers of the&s;e &s;ocieties enlarged their plans, and taken in art as well as &s;cience, one part of knowlege would have repre&s;&s;ed any faulty luxuriance in the other, and all would have mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted each others promotion.</P>
<P>ADD to this, the &s;ociety which, with a con|tempt of all collateral a&s;&s;i&s;tance, admits of members &s;killed in one &s;cience only, what|ever their diligence, or labour may be, will lo&s;e much time in the di&s;covery of &s;uch truths as are well known already to the

With regard to the Royal Society of London, the greate&s;t, perhaps, the olde&s;t in&s;titution of the kind, had it widened the ba&s;is of its in&s;titution, though they might not have pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">agated more di&s;coveries, at lea&s;t, they would have delivered them in a more plea|&s;ing and compendious form. They would have been hitherto free from the contempt of the ill-natured, and the raillery of the wit, for which, even candour mu&s;t allow, there is but too much foundation.</P>
<P>THE Berlin academy is &s;ubject to none of the inconveniencies above mentioned, but
<PB N="61" REF="68">
every one of its individuals is in a capacity of deriving more from the common &s;tock than he contributes to it, while each aca|demician &s;erves as a check upon the re&s;t of his fellows. Yet, perhaps, even this fine in&s;titution will &s;oon decay. As it ro&s;e, &s;o it will probably decline, with its great encourager. The &s;ociety, if I may &s;o &s;peak, is artificially &s;upported; the in|troduction of foreigners of learning was right; but in adopting a foreign language al&s;o, I mean the French, in which all the tran&s;actions are to be publi&s;hed, and que&s;|tions debated; in this there might have been an error. As I have already hinted, the language of the natives of every coun|try, &s;hould be al&s;o the language of its polite learning, I may be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry the thought too far, when I &s;ay, that to figure in polite learning, every
<PB N="62" REF="69">
country &s;hould make their own language, from their own manners; nor will they ever &s;ucceed by introducing that of an|other, which has been formed from man|ners which are different. Be&s;ides, an aca|demy compo&s;ed of foreigners, mu&s;t &s;till be recruited from abroad, unle&s;s all the natives of the country, to which it be|longs, are in a capacity to become can|didates for its honours, or rewards. While France continues to &s;upply Berlin, polite learning will flouri&s;h; when royal favour is withdrawn, learning will return to its natural country.</P>
<P>HOLLAND, at fir&s;t view, appears to have &s;ome preten&s;ions to polite learning. It may be regarded as the great emporium, not le&s;s of literature, than of every com|modity. Here, though de&s;titute of what
<PB N="63" REF="70">
may be properly called a language of their own, all the languages are under|&s;tood, cultivated and &s;poken. All u&s;eful inventions in arts, and new di&s;coveries in &s;cience, are publi&s;hed here almo&s;t as &s;oon as at the places which fir&s;t produced them. Its individuals have the &s;ame faults, how|ever, with the Germans, of making more u&s;e of their memory, than their judg|ment.

<P>THE other countries of Europe may be con&s;idered as immer&s;ed in ignorance, or making but feeble efforts to ri&s;e. Spain has long fallen from amazing Europe with her wit, to amu&s;ing them with the greatne&s;s of her catholic credulity. Rome con&s;iders her as the mo&s;t favourite of all her children, and &s;chool-divinity &s;till reigns there in triumph. In &s;pite of all attempts of the marquis D'en&s;anada, who

En&s;anada has been bani&s;hed, and now lives in exile; Frejo has incurred the hatred and contempt of every bigot, who&s;e errors he has attempted to op|po&s;e, and feels, no doubt, the unremitting di&s;plea&s;ure of the prie&s;thood. Per&s;ecution is a tribute, the Great mu&s;t ever pay for pre|heminence.</P>
<P>IT is a little extraordinary, however, why Spain, who&s;e genius is naturally fine, &s;hould be &s;o much behind the re&s;t of Europe, in this particular; or why &s;chool divinity &s;hould
<PB N="66" REF="73">
hold its ground there, for near 600 years. The rea&s;on, perhaps, may be, that philo&s;o|phical opinions, tho' in them&s;elves tran|&s;ient, acquire &s;tability in proportion, as they are connected with religion, and philo&s;o|phy and religion have no where been &s;o clo&s;ely united as here.</P>
<P>SWEDEN has of late made &s;ome attempts in polite learning, in its own language. Count Te&s;&s;in's in&s;tructions to the prince his pupil, are no bad beginning. If the mu&s;es can fix their re&s;idence &s;o far north|ward, perhaps, no country bids &s;o fair for their reception. They have, I am told, a lan|guage rude, but energetic; if &s;o, it will bear a poli&s;h; they have al&s;o a jealous &s;en&s;e of liberty, and that &s;trength of thinking, pecu|liar to northern climates, without its atten|dant ferocity. They will certainly in time,
<PB N="67" REF="74">
produce &s;omewhat great, if their inte&s;tine divi&s;ions do not unhappily prevent them.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of polite learning in Den|mark, may be comprized in the life of one &s;ingle man; it ro&s;e and fell with the late famous baron Holberg. This was, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t extraordi|nary per&s;onages that has done honour to the pre&s;ent century. His being the &s;on of a private centinel, did not abate the ardour of his ambition, for he learned to read, though without a ma&s;ter. Upon the death of his father, being left entirely de|&s;titute, he was involved in all that di&s;tre&s;s, which is common among the poor, and of which the Great have &s;carce any idea. However, though only a boy of nine years old, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in pur&s;uing his &s;tu|dies, travelled about from &s;chool to &s;chool,
<PB N="68" REF="75">
and begg'd his learning and his bread. When at the age of &s;eventeen, in&s;tead of applying him&s;elf to any of the lower oc|cupations, which &s;eem be&s;t adapted to &s;uch circum&s;tances, he was re&s;olved to tra|vel for improvement, from Norway the place of his birth, to Copenhagen the ca|pital city of Denmark. He lived here by teaching French, at the &s;ame time, avoid|ing no opportunity of improvement, that his &s;canty funds could permit. But his ambition was not to be re&s;trained, or his thir&s;t of knowledge &s;atisfied, until he had &s;een the world. Without money, recom|mendations or friends, he undertook to &s;et out upon his travels, and make the tour of Europe on foot. A good voice, and a trifling &s;kill in mu&s;ick, were the only finances he had to &s;upport an undertaking &s;o exten&s;ive; &s;o he travelled by day, and at night &s;ung at the
<PB N="69" REF="76">
doors of pea&s;ants hou&s;es, to get him&s;elf a lodging. In this manner, young Holberg pa&s;&s;ed thro' France, Germany, and Holland, and coming over to England, took up his re&s;idence for two years in the univer&s;ity of Oxford. Here, he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by teaching French and mu&s;ic, and wrote his univer&s;al hi&s;tory, his earlie&s;t, but wor&s;t performance. Furni&s;hed with all the learning of Europe, he at la&s;t thought proper to return to Copen|hagen, where his ingenious productions quickly gained him that favour he de&s;erved. He compo&s;ed not le&s;s than 18 comedies; tho&s;e in his own language are &s;aid to ex|cel, and tho&s;e which are wrote in French have peculiar merit. He was honoured with nobility, and enriched by the bounty of the king; &s;o that a life begun in con|tempt and penury, ended in opulence and e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A parallel between the decline of ancient and modern learning.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;imilitude between the ri&s;e and decline of ancient and modern learn|ing is &s;o obvious, that it &s;carcely requires an illu&s;tration. We may have &s;een, that wherever the poet was permitted to improve his native language, polite learning flouri&s;h|ed; where the critic undertook the &s;ame ta&s;k, it never ro&s;e to any degree of perfection. We have &s;een the genius of every country make more feeble advances to excellence in proportion, as the number of critics was great, and learning become more loquacious as it was le&s;s improving.</P>
<P>AN encrea&s;e of critici&s;m is, however, the natural con&s;equence of learning's be|coming
<PB N="75" REF="82">
univer&s;al. There are propor|tionably a greater number of learned men without any natural genius in every country, when the love of &s;cience is diffu&s;ed among all ranks of people, than in its incipient &s;tate, when this pa&s;&s;ion influences only the ambi|tious; but it is ten to one, that every man of learning without genius becomes a critic, therefore critics mu&s;t be proportionably more numerous when learning is diffus'd through all the degrees of mankind.</P>
<P>IF critics, therefore, or <HI>all &s;uch as judge by rule, and not by feelings,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become more numerous in the maturity of learning, than in its beginning; and if they have been always found by experience to in|jure it; I may be permitted to call critici&s;m, the natural decay of politene&s;s. A decay which may be deplored, but cannot be prevent|ed,
<PB N="76" REF="83">
&s;ince it encrea&s;es as the love of learning is diffu&s;ed. It cannot be remedied by rule, for every pre&s;cription encrea&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ince the man who writes again&s;t the critics, is o|bliged to add him&s;elf to the number. Other depravations in the republic of letters, &s;uch as affectation in &s;ome popular writer, leading others into vicious imitation; po|litical &s;truggles in the &s;tate; a depravity of morals among the people; ill directed encouragement, or no encouragement from the Great, the&s;e have been often found to co|operate in the decline of literature; and it has &s;ometimes declined, as in modern Italy, without them; but an encrea&s;e of critici&s;m has always portended a decay. Of all misfortunes, therefore, in the common|wealth of letters, this of judging from rule, and not from feeling, is the mo&s;t &s;e|vere. At &s;uch a tribunal, no work of ori|ginal
<PB N="77" REF="84">
merit can plea&s;e. Sublimity, if carried to an exalted height, approaches burle&s;que, and humour &s;inks into vulgarity; the per&s;on who cannot feel, may ridicule both as &s;uch, and bring rules to corroborate his a&s;&s;ertion. There is, in &s;hort, no excellence in writing, that &s;uch judges may not place among the neighbouring defects. Rules render the rea|der more difficult to be plea&s;ed, and abridge the author's power of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>IF we turn to England and France, we &s;hall perceive evident &s;ymptoms of this natural decay beginning to appear. Up|on a moderate calculation, there &s;eems to be as many volumes of critici&s;m publi&s;h|ed in tho&s;e countries, as of all other kinds of polite erudition united. Paris &s;ends forth not le&s;s than four literary journals every month, the Ann&eacute;-literaire, and the Fuille
<PB N="78" REF="85">
by Freron, the Journal Etrangere by the Chevalier D'Arc, and Le Mercure by Marmontel. We have two literary re|views in London, with critical news-pa|pers and magazines without number. The compilers of the&s;e re&s;emble the com|moners of Rome, they are all for levelling property, not by encrea&s;ing their own, but by dimini&s;hing that of others. The man who has any good nature in his di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t, however, be &s;omewhat di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee di&s;tingui&s;hed reputations often the &s;port of ignorance. To &s;ee by one fal&s;e plea|&s;antry, the future peace of a worthy man's life di&s;turbed, and this only becau&s;e he has un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted to in&s;truct or a|mu&s;e us. Tho' ill nature is far from being wit, yet it is generally laughed at as &s;uch. The critic enjoys the triumph, and a&s;cribes to his parts, what is only due to his effrontery.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="86">
IF there be any, however, among the&s;e writers, who being bred gentlemen and &s;cholars, are obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;uch an employment for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I wi&s;h them one more &s;uited to their inclinations; but for &s;uch who, wholly de&s;titute of edu|cation and genius, indent to the pre&s;s, and turn mere book-makers, they de&s;erve the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure. The&s;e add to the &s;in of critici&s;m the &s;in of ignorance al&s;o. Their trade is a bad one, and they are bad workmen in the trade.</P>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider tho&s;e indu&s;trious men as indebted to the works of other authors for a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, when I &s;ee them coming down at &s;tated intervals to rummage the book&s;eller's compter for mate|rials to work upon; it rai&s;es a &s;mile, tho' mixed with pity.

animal called by naturali&s;ts the &s;oldier.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The polite learning of England and France incapable of compari&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER preference the vul|gar of every nation may think due to their own in particular, the learn|ed who look beyond the bounds of na|tional prejudice, and are citizens of the world, &s;eem unanimous in regarding the Engli&s;h and French, as the principal literary &s;upporters of the pre&s;ent age.

<P><PB N="83" REF="90">
THIS acknowleged &s;uperiority was, how|ever, no ea&s;y conque&s;t over that national pride, with which every country is more or le&s;s tinctured. Every part of Europe was at one time or another candidates for this preheminence, which though they had not the good fortune to obtain, their at|tempts &s;erved in a &s;ubordinate degree to a&s;&s;i&s;t and refine the ta&s;te of their cotem|poraries. Thus Spain exhibited fine ex|amples of humour; Italy of delicacy; and Holland of freedom in enquiry. But to blend the&s;e excellencies and arrive at perfection, &s;eemed re&s;erved for the poets and philo&s;ophers of England and France in the illu&s;trious reigns of Queen Anne and Lewis XIV. The writers of that pe|riod, not only did honour to their re&s;pec|tive countries, but even to human nature. Like &s;tars lo&s;t in each others brightne&s;s, tho'
<PB N="84" REF="91">
no &s;ingle writer attracts our attention alone, yet their conjunction diffu&s;es &s;uch bright|ne&s;s upon the age, as will give the minute&s;t actions of tho&s;e two reigns an importance, which the revolutions of empire will want that were tran&s;acted in greater ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>YET that excellence which now excites the admiration of Europe, &s;erved at that pe|riod of which I am &s;peaking, only to pro|mote envy in the re&s;pective writers of tho&s;e two countries. They both took every me|thod to depreciate the merit of each other; the French &s;eldom mentioned the Engli&s;h but with di&s;re&s;pect, put them&s;elves foremo&s;t in every literary conte&s;t, and to leave the Engli&s;h no colour of competi|tion, placed the Italians in the &s;econd rank. The Engli&s;h, on the other hand, regard|ed the French as triflers, accu&s;ed the
<PB N="85" REF="92">
flym&s;y texture of their &s;tile, and the fal&s;e brilliancy of their &s;entiments. Yet, while each thus loaded the other with contempt, it &s;eemed as if done with a view of hav|ing their mutual plagiari&s;m pa&s;s with le&s;s &s;u&s;picion. In works of entertainment, we borrowed from the French un&s;paringly; and they plundered our &s;erious performances with as little compunction. Europe, how|ever, regarded the conte&s;t with impartia|lity, and the debate &s;eems at la&s;t determin|ed. Their writings are allowed to have more ta&s;te, ours more truth. We are al|lowed the honour of &s;triking out &s;enti|ments, they of dre&s;&s;ing them in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing form. If we have produc'd rea&s;oners who have refin'd mankind, it is by means of French tran&s;lations and ab&s;tracts that they are generally known in Europe. Their lan|guage has prevailed, and our philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="93">
AND this, indeed, is all the Engli&s;h had a right to expect in a conte&s;t of this na|ture, nor have they any ju&s;t rea&s;on to re|gret not being cho&s;en &s;upreme in ta&s;te as well as truth; for if we only con&s;i|der, how different our manners are from tho&s;e of every other nation on the con|tinent; how little we are vi&s;ited by tra|vellers of di&s;cernment; how ignorant our neighbours are of our various ab&s;urdities and humours; if we con&s;ider this, it can|not be expected, that our works of ta&s;te, which imitate our peculiar manners, can plea&s;e tho&s;e that are unacquainted with the originals them&s;elves. Though our de&s;crip|tions and characters are drawn from na|ture, yet they may appear exaggerated, or faintly copied, to tho&s;e, who, unacquainted with the peculiarities of our i&s;land, have

<P>THE French are much more fortunate than us in this particular.

<P>WHAT I propo&s;e as objections, are real|ly the &s;entiments I mean to prove, not to obviate.

<PB N="90" REF="97">
I mu&s;t own it, though, perhaps, by this opinion's prevailing, many a &s;cho|lium of the ancients, and many a folio of critici&s;m tran&s;lated from the French, now in repute among us, would infallibly &s;ink into oblivion. Engli&s;h ta&s;te, like Engli&s;h liberty, &s;hould be re&s;trained only by laws of its own promoting.</P>
<P>BUT to u&s;e argument as well as a&s;|&s;ertion, let us take a nearer view of what is called ta&s;te, examine its &s;tandard, &s;ee if foreign critics are ju&s;t in &s;etting up theirs as a model to us, or whether we be right in adopting their proffered improvements. As the di&s;qui&s;ition, however, is dry, I &s;hall &s;tudy conci&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL objects affect us with plea&s;ure one of the&s;e two ways, either by immediately
<PB N="91" REF="98">
gratifying the &s;en&s;es with plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, or by being thought in a &s;econdary manner capable of making other objects contribute to this effect. The plea&s;ures of immediate &s;en&s;ation are coeval with our &s;en&s;es, and, per|haps, mo&s;t vivid in infancy; the &s;econ|dary &s;ource of plea&s;ure re&s;ults from ex|perience only, from con&s;idering the ana|logy of nature, or the capacity a part has to unite to an whole. The plea&s;ures of the fir&s;t &s;ort, are derived from the beau|ty of the object, tho&s;e of the &s;econd, from a con&s;ideration of its u&s;e. The fir&s;t are natural, no art can encrea&s;e them without mending the organ which was to give them admi&s;&s;ion. The &s;econd are artificial, and continually altering, as whim, climate, or &s;ea&s;ons direct. To illu&s;trate my meaning. The beauty of a guinea, for in&s;tance, its re|gular figure, and &s;hining colour, are equally
<PB N="92" REF="99">
obvious to the &s;en&s;es in every country and climate, the&s;e qualities plea&s;e the wilde&s;t &s;avage as much as the mo&s;t poli&s;hed Eu|ropean; as far as it affects the &s;en&s;es, the plea&s;ure a guinea gives is therefore in every country the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT the con&s;ideration of the u&s;es it can be turned to, are another &s;ource of plea&s;ure, which is different in different countries. A native of Madaga&s;car prefers to it a gla&s;s bead; a native of Holland pre|fers it to every thing el&s;e. The plea&s;ure then of its &s;en&s;ible qualities are every where the &s;ame; tho&s;e of its &s;econdary qualities every where different. He, whom na|ture has furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t vivid perceptions of beauty, and to whom ex|perience has &s;ugge&s;ted the greate&s;t num|ber of u&s;es, in the contemplation of any
<PB N="93" REF="100">
object, may be &s;aid to receive the greate&s;t plea&s;ure that object is capable of afford|ing. Thus the Barbarian finds &s;ome &s;mall plea&s;ure in the contemplation of a guinea; the enlightened European who is acquainted with its u&s;es, &s;till more than him; the chymi&s;t, who be&s;ides this, knows the peculiar fixedne&s;s and malleability of the metal, mo&s;t of all. This capacity of receiving plea&s;ure, may be called Ta&s;te in the objects of nature. The polite arts in all their variety are only an imitation of nature. He then mu&s;t excel in them, who is capable of in&s;piring us at once with the mo&s;t vivid perceptions of beau|ty, and with the greate&s;t number of ex|perimental u&s;es in any object de&s;cribed. But as the arti&s;t, to give vivid percep|tions mu&s;t be per&s;picuous and conci&s;e, and yet to exhibit u&s;efulne&s;s requires mi|nutene&s;s;
<PB N="94" REF="101">
here are two oppo&s;ite qualities required in the writer, in one of which his imagination, in the other his rea&s;on|ing faculty is every moment liable to offend; what has he in this ca&s;e to guide him?

<P>THE perfection of ta&s;te therefore pro|ceeds from a knowledge of what is beauti|ful and u&s;eful. Critici&s;m profe&s;&s;es to en|crea&s;e our ta&s;te.

<PB N="95" REF="102">
as was ob&s;erved, is different in every cli|mate and country; what is u&s;eful in one climate being often noxious in another; therefore critici&s;m mu&s;t under&s;tand the na|ture of the climate and country, &amp;c. be|fore it gives rules to direct Ta&s;te.

of the people to whom the critici&s;m is directed.</P>
<P>IF, for in&s;tance, the Engli&s;h be a people who look upon death as an incident no way terrible, but &s;ometimes fly to it for refuge from the calamities of life, why &s;hould a Frenchman be di&s;gu&s;ted at our bloody &s;tage? there is nothing hideous in the repre&s;entation to one of us, whatever there might be to him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of polite learning in France.</HEAD>
<P>THAT levity for which we are apt to de&s;pi&s;e the French, is probably the principal &s;ource of their happine&s;s. An agreeable oblivion of pa&s;t plea&s;ures, a freedom from &s;olicitude about future ones, and a poignant ze&s;t of every immediate enjoyment, if they be not philo&s;ophy, are at lea&s;t excellent &s;ub&s;titutes in its room. By this they are taught to regard the pre|&s;ent period with admiration. The pre&s;ent manners, and the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, &s;urpa&s;s all that preceded; a Frenchman is as little di&s;plea&s;ed with every thing about him, as with his own per&s;on or exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106">
THIS agreeable enthu&s;ia&s;m, tinctures not only their manners, but their learning, and ta&s;te. While we with a de&s;pondence characteri&s;tic of our nation, are for re|moving back Briti&s;h excellence to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, our more hap|py rivals of the continent, cry up the writers of the pre&s;ent times with rapture, and regard the age of Lewis XV. as the true Augu&s;tan age of France.</P>
<P>THE truth is, their pre&s;ent writers have not fallen &s;o far &s;hort of the merits of their ance&s;tors, as ours have done. That &s;elf|&s;ufficiency, now mentioned, may have been of &s;ervice to them in this particular. By fancying them&s;elves &s;uperior to their an|ce&s;tors, they have been encouraged to enter the li&s;ts with confidence, and by not being dazled at the &s;plendor of ano|ther's
<PB N="100" REF="107">
reputation, have &s;ometimes had &s;a|gacity to mark out an unbeaten path to fame, for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OTHER cau&s;es al&s;o may be a&s;&s;igned, that their &s;econd growth of genius is &s;till more vigorous than ours. Their encou|ragements to merit are more &s;kilfully di|rected, the link of patronage and learn|ing &s;till continues unbroken. The French nobility have certainly a mo&s;t plea&s;ing way of &s;atisfying the vanity of an author, without indulging his avarice. A man of literary merit, is &s;ure of being care&s;&s;ed by the Great, though &s;eldom en|riched. His pen&s;ion from the crown ju&s;t &s;upplies half a competence, and the &s;ale of his labours, makes &s;ome &s;mall addition to his circum&s;tances; thus the author leads a life of &s;plendid poverty, and &s;eldom be|comes
<PB N="101" REF="108">
wealthy or indolent enough, to di&s;|continue an exertion of tho&s;e abilities, by which he ro&s;e. With the Engli&s;h, it is different; our writers of ri&s;ing me|rit are generally neglected; while the few of an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, are over paid by a luxurious affluence. The fir&s;t encounter every hard&s;hip which general|ly attends upon a&s;piring indigence; the latter, enjoy the vulgar, and, perhaps, the more prudent &s;atisfaction of putting riches in competition with fame. Tho&s;e are often &s;een to &s;pend their youth in want and ob&s;curity; the&s;e are &s;ometimes found to lead an old age of indolence and avarice. But &s;uch treatment mu&s;t naturally be expected from a people, who&s;e national character it is, to be &s;low and cau|tious in making friends, but violent in friend&s;hips once contracted. The Engli&s;h
<PB N="102" REF="109">
nobility, in &s;hort, are often known to give greater rewards to genius than the French, who, however, are much more judicious in the application of their empty favours.</P>
<P>THE fair &s;ex in France have al&s;o not a little contributed to prevent the decline of ta&s;te and literature, by expecting &s;uch qualifications in their admirers. A man of fa&s;hion at Paris, however contemptible we may think him here, mu&s;t be acquaint|ed with the reigning modes of philo&s;o|phy as well as of dre&s;s, to be able to enter|tain his mi&s;tre&s;s agreeably. The charm|ing pedants are not to be caught like &s;ome dam&s;els to be &s;een in Holland, by dumb &s;hew, by a &s;queeze of the hand, or the ogling of a broad eye: but mu&s;t be pur&s;ued at once through all the labyrinths of the Newtonian &s;y&s;tem, the mazy me|taphy&s;ics

<P>TO the&s;e advantages may be added the reception of their language into the different courts of Europe. An author, who excels, is &s;ure of having all the po|lite for admirers, and is encouraged to write by the plea&s;ing expectation of univer&s;al fame. Added to this, tho&s;e countries who can make nothing good in their own language, have lately begun to write in this, &s;ome of who&s;e produc|tions contribute to &s;upport the pre&s;ent li|terary reputation of France.</P>

THE age of Lewis the XIVth, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, is &s;till &s;uperior. It is indeed a misfortune for a fine writer to be born in a period &s;o enlightened as ours.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of learning in Great Britain.</HEAD>
<P>TO acquire a character for learning among the Engli&s;h at pre&s;ent, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know much more than is either important or u&s;eful. The ab|&s;urd pa&s;&s;ion of being deemed profound, has done more injury to all kinds of &s;cience, than is generally imagined. Some thus exhau&s;t their natural &s;agacity in ex|ploring the intricacies of another man's thought, and have never found lei&s;ure to think for them&s;elves; others have carried on learning from that &s;tage, where the good &s;en&s;e of our ance&s;tors thought it too minute or too &s;peculative to in&s;truct or a|mu&s;e. By the indu&s;try of &s;uch, the &s;ciences
<PB N="118" REF="125">
fciences which in them&s;elves are ea&s;y of ac|ce&s;s, affright the learner with the &s;everity of their appearance. He &s;ees them &s;urrounded with &s;peculation and &s;ubtilty, placed there by their profe&s;&s;ors as if with a view of de|terring his approach. From hence it hap|pens, that the generality of readers fly from the &s;cholar to the compiler, who offers them a more &s;afe and &s;peedy con|veyance.</P>
<P>FROM this fault al&s;o ari&s;es that mu|tual contempt between the &s;cholar and the man of the world, of which every day's experience furni&s;heth in&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE man of ta&s;te, however, &s;tands neu|ter in this controver&s;y, he &s;eems placed in a middle &s;tation, between the world and the cell, between learning and common

&s;en&s;e. He teaches the vulgar on what part of a character to lay the empha&s;is of prai&s;e, and the &s;cholar where to point his application &s;o as to de&s;erve it. By his means, even the philo&s;opher, acquires po|pular applau&s;e, and all that are truly great the admiration of po&s;terity. By means of polite learning alone, the patriot and the hero, the man who prai&s;eth virtue, and he who practices it, who fights &s;ucce&s;sfully for his country, or who dies in its defence, become immortal.</P>
<P>LET none affect to de&s;pi&s;e future fame, the actions of even the lowe&s;t part of man|kind te&s;tify a de&s;ire of this kind. Wealth, titles, and &s;everal paltry advantages, are &s;ecured for po&s;terity, who can only give their applau&s;e in return. If all ranks, therefore, are in&s;pired with this pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="120" REF="127">
how great &s;hould his encouragement be, who is capable of conferring it not only upon the mo&s;t de&s;erving, but even upon the age in which he lives?</P>
<P>YET this hone&s;t ambition of being ad|mired by po&s;terity, cannot be gratified without continual efforts in the pre&s;ent age to de&s;erve it. For if the rewards of genius are improperly directed; if tho&s;e who are capable of &s;upporting the honour of the times by their writing, pre&s;er opulence to fame; if the &s;tage &s;hould be &s;hut to writers of merit, and open only to intere&s;t or intrigue. If &s;uch &s;hould hap|pen to be the vile complexion of the times, the very virtues of the age will be forgotten by po&s;terity; and nothing remembered, ex|cept our filling a cha&s;m in the regi&s;ters of time, or having &s;erved to continue the &s;pecies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the encouragement of learning.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing authors are more apt to lament, than want of encouragement from the age. Whatever their differences in other re&s;pects may be, they are all ready to unite in this com|plaint, and each indirectly offers him&s;elf as an in&s;tance of the truth of his a&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>THE beneficed divine, who&s;e wants are only imaginary, expo&s;tulates as bitterly as the poore&s;t author, that ever &s;nuffed his candle with finger and thumb. Should intere&s;t or good &s;ortune, advance the di|vine to a bi&s;hopric, or the poor &s;on of
<PB N="122" REF="129">
Parna&s;&s;us into that place which the other has re&s;ign'd; both are authors no longer, the one goes to prayers once a day, kneels upon cu&s;hions of velvet, and thanks gra|cious heaven for having made the circum|&s;tances of all mankind &s;o extremely happy; the other battens on all the delicacies of life, enjoys his wife and his ea&s;y chair, and &s;ome|times, for the &s;ake of conver&s;ation, deplores the luxury of the&s;e degenerate days.</P>
<P>ALL encouragements to merit are mi&s;|applied, which make the author too rich to continue his profe&s;&s;ion. There can be nothing more ju&s;t than the old ob&s;erva|tion, that authors, like running hor&s;es, &s;hould be fed but not fattened. If we would continue them in our &s;ervice, we &s;hould reward them with a little money and a great deal of prai&s;e, &s;till keeping
<PB N="123" REF="130">
their avarice &s;ub&s;ervient to their ambition. Not that I think a writer incapable of filling an employment with dignity, I would only in&s;inuate, that when made a bi&s;hop or &s;tate&s;man, he will continue to plea&s;e us as a writer no longer. As to re&s;ume a former allu&s;ion, the running hor&s;e, when fattened, will &s;till be fit for very u&s;eful purpo&s;es, though unqualified for a cour&s;er.</P>
<P>No nation gives greater encouragements to learning than we do; yet, at the &s;ame time, none are &s;o injudicious in the application. We &s;eem to confer them with the &s;ame view, that &s;tate&s;men have been known to grant employments at court, rather as bribes to &s;ilence, than incentives to emulation.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">
UPON this principle, all our magnifi|cent endowments of colleges are errone|ous, and at be&s;t, more frequently enrich the prudent than reward the ingenious. A lad who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are not &s;trong enough in youth to mi&s;lead him from that path of &s;cience, which his tutors, and not his inclinations, have chalked out, by four or five years per&s;everance, will probably ob|tain every advantage and honour his col|lege can be&s;tow. I forget whether the &s;imile has been u&s;ed before, but I would compare the man, who&s;e youth has been thus pa&s;t in the tranquility of di&s;pa&s;&s;io|nate prudence, to liquors which never fer|ment, and con&s;equently, continue always muddy. Pa&s;&s;ions may rai&s;e a commotion in the youthful brea&s;t, but they di&s;turb only to refine it. However this be, mean talents are often rewarded in colleges, with
<PB N="125" REF="132">
an ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The candidates for preferments of this kind, often regard their admi&s;&s;ion as a patent for future lazi|ne&s;s; &s;o that a life begun in &s;tudious la|bour, is often continued in luxurious af|fluence.</P>
<P>AMONG the univer&s;ities abroad, I have ever ob&s;erved their riches and their learning in a reciprocal proportion, their &s;tupidity and pride encrea&s;ing with their opulence. Happening once in conver&s;ation with Gau|bius of Leyden, to mention the college of Edinburgh, he began by complaining, that all the Engli&s;h &s;tudents, which formerly came to his univer&s;ity, now went intirely there; and the fact &s;urprized him more, as Leyden was now as well as ever furni&s;h|ed with ma&s;ters excellent in their re&s;pec|tive profe&s;&s;ions. He concluded by a&s;king,
<PB N="126" REF="133">
if the profe&s;&s;ors of Edinburgh were rich. I reply'd, that the &s;alary of a profe&s;&s;or there &s;eldom amounted to more than thirty pounds a year. Poor men, &s;ays he, I heartily wi&s;h they were better provided for, until they become rich, we can have no ex|pectation of Engli&s;h &s;tudents at Leyden.</P>
<P>PREMIUMS al&s;o, propo&s;ed for literary excellence, when given as encourage|ments to boys may be u&s;eful, but when de&s;igned as rewards to men, are cer|tainly mi&s;applied. We have &s;eldom &s;een a performance of any great merit, in con&s;e|quence of rewards propo&s;ed in this manner. Who has ever ob&s;erved a writer of any eminence, a candidate in &s;o precarious a conte&s;t? The man who knows the real value of his own genius, will no more venture it upon an uncertainty, than he
<PB N="127" REF="134">
who knows the true u&s;e of a guinea, will &s;take it with a &s;harper by throwing a main.</P>
<P>EVERY encouragement given to &s;tupi|dity, when known to be &s;uch, is al&s;o a negative in&s;ult upon genius. This appears in nothing more evident, than the undi&s;|tingui&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;ollicit &s;ub|&s;criptions. When fir&s;t brought into fa|&s;hion, &s;ub&s;criptions were conferred upon the ingenious alone, or tho&s;e who were re|puted &s;uch. But at pre&s;ent, we &s;ee them made a re&s;ource of indigence, and re|que&s;ted not as rewards of merit, but as a relief of di&s;tre&s;s. If trade&s;men hap|pen to want &s;kill in conducting their own bu&s;ine&s;s, yet they are able to write a book; if mechanics want money, or ladies &s;hame, they write books and &s;oli|cit &s;ub&s;criptions. Scarce a morning pa&s;&s;es,
<PB N="128" REF="135">
that propo&s;als of this nature are not thru&s;t into the half-opening doors of the rich, with, perhaps, a paltry petition, &s;hewing the author's wants, but not his merits. I would not willingly prevent that pity which is due to indigence, but while the &s;treams of liberality are thus diffu&s;ed, they mu&s;t in the end become proportionably &s;hallow.</P>
<P>WHAT then are the proper encourage|ments of genius? I an&s;wer, &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and re&s;pect, for the&s;e are rewards congenial to its nature. Every animal has an ali|ment peculiarly &s;uited to its con&s;titution. The heavy ox &s;eeks nouri&s;hment from earth; the light cameleon has been &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t on air; a &s;parer diet even than this, will &s;atisfy the man of true genius, for he makes a luxurious banquet upon empty applau&s;e. It is this alone, which
<PB N="129" REF="136">
has in&s;pired all that ever was truly great and noble among us. It is, as Cicero finely calls it the eccho of virtue. Avarice is the pa&s;&s;ion of inferior natures; money the pay of the common herd. The au|thor who draws his quill merely to take a pur&s;e, no more de&s;erves &s;ucce&s;s than he who pre&s;ents a pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>WHEN the link between patronage and learning was entire, then all who de&s;erved fame were in a capacity of attaining it. When the great Somers was at the helm, patronage was fa&s;hionable among our no|bility. The middle ranks of mankind, who generally imitate the Great, then followed their example; and applauded from fa&s;hion, if not from feeling. I have heard an old poet of that glorious age &s;ay, that a dinner with his lord&s;hip, has
<PB N="130" REF="137">
procured him invitations for the whole week following: that an airing in his patron's chariot, has &s;upplied him with a citizen's coach on every future occa&s;ion. For who would not be proud to enter|tain a man who kept &s;o much good com|pany?</P>
<P>BUT this link now &s;eems entirely bro|ken. Since the days of a certain prime mini&s;ter of inglorious memory, the learn|ed have been kept pretty much at a di&s;|tance. A jockey, or a laced player, &s;up|plies the place of the &s;cholar, poet, or the man of virtue. Tho&s;e conver&s;ations, once the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom, wit, and innocence, are now turned to humbler topics, little more being expected from a companion than a laced coat, a pliant bow, and an
<PB N="131" REF="138">
immoderate friend&s;hip for&mdash;a well-&s;erved table.</P>
<P>WIT, when neglected by the great, is generally de&s;pi&s;ed by the vulgar. Tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the world, are apt to fancy the man of wit, as leading a very agreeable life. They conclude, per|haps, that he is attended to with &s;ilent ad|miration, and dictates to the re&s;t of man|kind, with all the eloquence of con&s;cious &s;uperiority. Very different is his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He is called an author, and all know that an author is a thing only to be laughed at. His per&s;on, not his je&s;t, be|comes the mirth of the company. At his ap|proach, the mo&s;t fat unthinking face, bright|ens into malicious meaning. Even alder|men laugh, and revenge on him, the ridi|cule which was lavi&s;h'd on their forefathers.</P>
<Q><PB N="132" REF="139">
<L>Etiam victis redit in praecordia virtus,</L>
<L>Victore&s;que cadunt.</L></Q>
<P>IT is indeed a reflection &s;omewhat mor|tifying to the author, who breaks his ranks, and &s;ingles out for public favour to think that he mu&s;t combat contempt, before he can arrive at glory. That he mu&s;t expect to have all the fools of &s;ociety united again&s;t him, before he can hope for the applau&s;e of the judicious. For this, however, he mu&s;t prepare before|hand; as tho&s;e who have no idea of the difficulty of his employment, will be apt to regard his inactivity as idlene&s;s, and not having a notion of the pangs of uncom|plying thought in them&s;elves, it is not to be expected they &s;hould have any de&s;ire of rewarding by re&s;pecting them in others.</P>

the teizing employments of printing and publi&s;hing, how will you be able to lull the critics, who like Cerberus, are po&s;ted at all the avenues of literature, and who &s;ettle the merits of every new per|formance. How, I &s;ay, will you be able to make them open in your favour? There are always three or four literary journals in France, as many in Hol|land, each &s;upporting oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts. The book&s;ellers, who guide the&s;e perio|dical compilations, find their account in being &s;evere; the authors employed by them, have wretchedne&s;s to add to their natural malignity. The majority may be in your favour, but you may de|pend on being torn by the re&s;t. Load|ed with unmerited &s;currility, perhaps you reply; they rejoin, both plead at the
<PB N="136" REF="143">
bar of the public, and both are condemn|ed to ridicule.</P>
<P>'BUT if you write for the &s;tage, your ca&s;e is &s;till more worthy compa&s;&s;ion. You are there to be judged by men, whom the cu&s;tom of the times has ren|dered contemptible. Irritated by their own inferiority, they exert all their little tyranny upon you, revenging upon the author, the in&s;ults they receive from the public. From &s;uch men then you are to expect your &s;entence. Suppo&s;e your piece admitted, acted: one &s;ingle ill-na|tured je&s;t from the pit, is &s;ufficient to cancel all your labours. But allowing that it &s;ucceeds. There are an hundred &s;quibs flying all abroad to prove, that it &s;hould not have &s;ucceeded. You &s;hall find your brighte&s;t &s;cenes burle&s;qued by

<P>'BUT, perhaps, with a panting heart, you carry your piece before a woman of quality. She gives the labours of your brain to her maid, to be cut into &s;hreds for curling her hair; while the laced footman, who carries the gaudy livery of luxury, in&s;ults your appear|ance, who bear the livery of indigence.</P>
<P>'BUT granting your excellence has at la&s;t forced envy to confe&s;s, that your works have &s;ome merit; this then is all the reward you can expect while living. However, for this tribute of applau&s;e, you mu&s;t expect per&s;ecution. You will be reputed the author of &s;candal which

<P>YET it were well, if none but the dunces of &s;ociety, were combined to render the profe&s;&s;ion of an author ridiculous or unhappy. Men of the fir&s;t eminence are often found to indulge this illiberal vein of raillery. Two contending writers often by the oppo&s;ition of their wit, render their profe&s;&s;ion contempti|ble in the eyes of ignorants, who &s;hould have been taught to admire. Whatever the reader may think of him&s;elf, it is at lea&s;t two to one, but he is a greater blockhead than the mo&s;t &s;cribling dunce he affects to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE poet's poverty is a &s;tanding to|pic of contempt. His writing for bread is an unpardonable offence. Perhaps, of all mankind, an author, in the&s;e
<PB N="140" REF="147">
times, is u&s;ed mo&s;t hardly. We keep him poor, and yet revile his poverty. Like angry parents, who correct their children till they cry, and then correct them for crying, we reproach him for living by his wit, and yet allow him no other means to live.</P>
<P>HIS taking refuge in garrets and cellars, and living among vermin, have, of late, been violently objected to him, and that by men, who I dare hope, are more apt to pity than in&s;ult his di&s;tre&s;s. Is poverty the writer's fault? No doubt, he knows how to prefer a bottle of champaign, to the nectar of the neighbouring alehou&s;e, or a veni&s;on pa&s;ty to a plate of potatoes. Want of delicacy is not in him, but in us, who deny him the opportunity of making an elegant choice.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="148">
WIT certainly is the property of tho&s;e who have it, nor &s;hould we be di&s;plea&s;ed if it is the only property a man &s;ometimes has. We mu&s;t not under-rate him who u&s;es it for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and flies from the ingratitude of the age, even to a book|&s;eller for redre&s;s. If the profe&s;&s;ion of an author is to be laughed at by &s;tupids, it is better &s;ure to be contemptibly rich, than contemptibly poor. For all the wit that ever adorned the human mind, will at pre&s;ent no more &s;hield the author's po|verty from ridicule, than his high topped gloves conceal the unavoidable omi&s;&s;ions of his laundre&s;s.</P>
<P>TO be more &s;erious, new fa&s;hions, follies, and vices, make new monitors ne|ce&s;&s;ary in every age. An author may be con&s;idered as a merciful &s;ub&s;titute to the
<PB N="142" REF="149">
legi&s;lature; he acts not by puni&s;hing crimes, but preventing them; however virtuous the pre&s;ent age, there may be &s;till grow|ing employment for ridicule, or reproof, for per&s;ua&s;ion, or &s;atire. If the author be, therefore, &s;till &s;o nece&s;&s;ary among us, let us treat him with proper con&s;idera|tion, as a child of the public, not a rent|charge on the community. And, indeed, a <HI>child</HI> of the public he is in all re&s;pects; for while &s;o well able to direct others, how incapable is he frequently found of guiding him&s;elf. His &s;implicity expo&s;es him to all the in&s;idious approaches of cun|ning, his &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;lighte&s;t inva|&s;ions of contempt. Though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fortitude to &s;tand unmoved the expect|ed bur&s;ts of an earthquake, yet of feel|ings &s;o exqui&s;itely poignant, as to ago|nize under the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;appointment.

Let us not then aggra|vate tho&s;e natural inconveniencies by neg|lect; we have had &s;ufficient in&s;tances of this kind already.

Happy, if <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> of our neglect, not <HI>raging</HI> at our ingratitude. It is enough, that the age has already yielded in&s;tances of men pre&s;&s;ing foremo&s;t in the li&s;ts of fame, and worthy of better times, &s;chooled by continued adver&s;ity into an hatred of

their kind, flying from thought to drun|kenne&s;s, yielding to the united pre&s;&s;ure of labour, penury, and &s;orrow, &s;inking un|heeded, without one friend to drop a tear on their unattended ob&s;equies, and indebt|ed to charity for a grave among the dregs of mankind.</P>
<P>THE author, when unpatronized by the Great, has naturally recour&s;e to the book&s;eller. There cannot be, perhaps, imagined a combination more prejudicial to ta&s;te than this. It is the intere&s;t of the one to allow as little for writing, and of the other to write as much as po&s;&s;ible; accordingly, tedious compi|lations, and periodical magazines, are the re&s;ult of their joint endeavours. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the author bids adieu to fame, writes for bread, and for that only.
<PB N="145" REF="152">
Imagination is &s;eldom called in; he &s;its down to addre&s;s the venal mu&s;e with the mo&s;t phlegmatic apathy; and, as we are told of the Ru&s;&s;ian, courts his mi&s;tre&s;s by falling a&s;leep in her lap. His repu|tation never &s;preads in a wider circle than that of the trade, who generally value him, not for the finene&s;s of his compo|&s;ition, but the quantity he works off in a given time.</P>
<P>A LONG habitude of writing for bread, thus turns the ambition of every author at la&s;t into avarice. He finds, that he has wrote many years, that the public are &s;carcely acquainted even with his name; he de&s;pairs of applau&s;e, and turns to pro|fit, which invites him. He finds that money procures all tho&s;e advantages, that re&s;pect, and that ea&s;e, which he vainly
<PB N="146" REF="153">

<P>THERE never was an unbeaten path trodden by the poet, that the critic did not endeavour to reclaim him, by calling his attempt innovation. This might be in&s;tanced in Dante, who fir&s;t followed na|ture,
<PB N="149" REF="156">
and was per&s;ecuted by the critics as long as he lived. Thus novelty, one of the greate&s;t beauties in poetry, mu&s;t be avoid|ed, or the connoi&s;&s;eur be di&s;plea&s;ed. It is one of the chief privileges, however, of genius, to fly from the herd of imi|tators by &s;ome happy &s;ingularity; for &s;hould he &s;tand &s;till, his heavy pur&s;uers will at length certainly come up, and fairly di&s;pute the victory.</P>
<P>THE ingenious Mr. Hogarth u&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert, that every one, except the connoi&s;|&s;eur, was a judge of painting. The &s;ame may be a&s;&s;erted of writing; the public in general &s;et the whole piece in the pro|per point of view; the critic lays his eye clo&s;e to all its minutene&s;&s;es, and condemns or approves in detail. And this may be

<P>FROM a de&s;ire in the critic of grafting the &s;pirit of ancient languages upon the Engli&s;h, has proceeded of late &s;everal di&s;agreeable in|&s;tances of pedantry. Among the number, I think we may reckon blank ver&s;e. No|thing but the greate&s;t &s;ublimity of &s;ub|ject can render &s;uch a mea&s;ure plea&s;ing; however, we now &s;ee it u&s;ed upon the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions; it has particularly found way into our didactic poetry, and is likely to bring that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition into di&s;repute, for which the Engli&s;h are de|&s;ervedly famous.</P>
<P>THOSE who are acquainted with writ|ing, know that our language runs almo&s;t
<PB N="151" REF="158">
naturally into blank ver&s;e. The writers of our novels, romances, and all of this cla&s;s, who have no notion of &s;tile, natu|rally hobble into this unharmonious mea|&s;ure. If rhymes, therefore, be more dif|ficult, for that very rea&s;on, I would have our poets write in rhyme. Such a re&s;tric|tion upon the thought of a good poet, often lifts and encrea&s;es the vehemence of every &s;entiment; for fancy, like a foun|tain, plays highe&s;t by dimini&s;hing the aperture. But rhymes, it will be &s;aid, are a remnant of monki&s;h &s;tupidity, an in|novation upon the poetry of the ancients. They are but indifferently acquainted with antiquity, who make the a&s;&s;ertion. Rhymes are probably of older date than either the Greek or Latin dactyl and &s;pond&eacute;. The Celtic, which is allowed to be the fir&s;t language &s;poken in Europe, has ever
<PB N="152" REF="159">
pre&s;erved them, as we may find in the Edda of Iceland, and the Iri&s;h carrols &s;till &s;ung among the original inhabitants of that i&s;land. Olaus Wormius gives us &s;ome of the Teutonic poetry in this way; and Pantoppidan, bi&s;hop of Bergen, &s;ome of the Norwegian; in &s;hort, this jingle of &s;ounds is almo&s;t natural to mankind, at lea&s;t, it is &s;o to our language, if we may judge from many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to throw it off.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have employed &s;o much time in oppo&s;ing this erroneous inno|vation, if it were not apt to intro|duce another in its train: I mean, a di&s;gu&s;ting &s;olemnity of manner into our poetry; and as the pro&s;e writer has been ever found to follow the poet, it mu&s;t con&s;equently bani&s;h in both, all that agree|able
<PB N="153" REF="160">
trifling, which, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s it, often deceives us into in&s;truction. Dry rea&s;oning, and dull morality, have no force with the wild fanta&s;tic libertine. He mu&s;t be met with &s;miles, and courted with the allurements of gaiety. He mu&s;t be taught to believe, that he is in pur|&s;uit of plea&s;ure, and be &s;urprized into re|formation. The fine&s;t &s;entiment, and the mo&s;t weighty truth, may put on a plea&s;|ing face, and it is even virtuous to je&s;t when &s;erious advice might be di&s;gu&s;t|ing. But in&s;tead of this, the mo&s;t tri|fling performance among us now, a&s;&s;umes all the didactic &s;tiffne&s;s of wi&s;dom. The mo&s;t diminutive &s;on of fame, or of fa|mine, has his <HI>we</HI> and his <HI>us,</HI> his <HI>fir&s;tlys</HI> and his <HI>&s;econdlys</HI> as methodical, as if bound in cow-hide, and clo&s;ed with cla&s;ps of bra&s;s.

<P>THESE pamphlets &s;hould be con&s;idered as pills to purge melancholly; they &s;hould be made up in our &s;plenetic climate, to be taken as phy&s;ic, and not &s;o as to be u&s;ed when we take it. Some &s;uch law &s;hould be enacted in the republic of let|ters, as we find take place in the hou&s;e of commons. As no man there can &s;hew his wi&s;dom, unle&s;s fir&s;t qualified by three hundred pounds a year, &s;o none here &s;hould profe&s;s gravity, unle&s;s his work amounted to three hundred pages.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, by the power of one &s;ingle mono&s;yllable, our critics have almo&s;t got the victory over humour among&s;t us.
<PB N="155" REF="162">
Does the poet paint the ab&s;urdities of the vulgar; then he is <HI>low:</HI> does he exaggerate the features of folly, to render it more thorough|ly ridiculous, he is then very <HI>low.</HI> In &s;hort, they have pro&s;cribed the comic or &s;atyrical mu&s;e from every walk but high life, which, though abounding in fools as well as the humble&s;t &s;tation, is by no means &s;o fruit|ful in ab&s;urdity. Among well-bred fools we may de&s;pi&s;e much, but have little to laugh at; nature &s;eems to pre&s;ent us with an univer&s;al blank of &s;ilk, ribbands, &s;miles and whi&s;pers; ab&s;urdity is the poet's game, and good breeding is the nice concealment of ab&s;urdities. The truth is, the critic generally mi&s;takes humour for wit, which is a very different excellence. Wit rai&s;es human na|ture above its level; humour acts a contrary part, and equally depre&s;&s;es it. To expect ex|alted humour, is a contradiction in terms;
<PB N="156" REF="163">
and the critic, by demanding an impo&s;&s;ibility from the comic poet, has, in effect, bani&s;hed new comedy from the &s;tage. But to put the &s;ame thought in a different light:</P>
<P>WHEN an unexpected &s;imilitude in two objects &s;trikes the imagination; in other words, when a thing is <HI>wittily</HI> expre&s;&s;ed, all our plea&s;ure turns into admiration of the arti&s;t, who had fancy enough to draw the picture. When a thing is <HI>humour|ou&s;ly</HI> de&s;cribed, our bur&s;t of laughter pro|ceeds from a very different cau&s;e; we com|pare the ab&s;urdity of the character repre|&s;ented with our own, and triumph in our con&s;cious &s;uperiority. No natural defect can be a cau&s;e of laughter, becau&s;e it is a misfortune to which our&s;elves are lia|ble; a defect of this kind, changes the pa&s;&s;ion into pity or horror; we only laugh at tho&s;e in&s;tances of moral ab&s;ur|dity,
<PB N="157" REF="164">
to which we are con&s;cious that we our|&s;elves are not liable. For in&s;tance, &s;hould I de&s;cribe a man as wanting his no&s;e, there is no humour in this, as it is an accident to which human nature is &s;ubject, and may be any man's ca&s;e: but &s;hould I repre|&s;ent this man without his no&s;e, as extreme|ly curious in the choice of his &s;nuff-box, we here &s;ee him guilty of an ab&s;urdity of which we imagine our&s;elves can never be guilty, and therefore applaud our own good &s;en&s;e on the compari&s;on. Thus, then, the plea&s;ure we receive from wit, turns on the admiration of another; that we feel from humour, centers in the admiration of our|&s;elves. The poet, therefore, mu&s;t place the object he would have the &s;ubject of humour in a &s;tate of inferiority; in other words, the &s;ubject of humour mu&s;t be low.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="165">
THE &s;olemnity worn by many of our modern writers is, I fear, often the ma&s;k of dulne&s;s; for certain it is, it &s;eems to fit every author who plea&s;es to put it on. By the complexion of many of our late publications, one might be apt to cry out with Cicero, <HI>Civem mehercule non puto e&s;&s;e qui his temporibus ridere po&s;&s;it.</HI> On my con&s;cience, I believe we have all forgot to laugh in the&s;e days. Such writers pro|bably make no di&s;tinction between what is prai&s;ed, and what is plea&s;ing; between tho&s;e commendations which the reader pays his own di&s;cernment, and tho&s;e which are the genuine re&s;ult of his &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>AS our gentlemen writers have it there|fore &s;o much in their power to lead the ta&s;te of the times, they may now part with the inflated &s;tile that has for &s;ome

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Theatre may be regarded as partaking of the &s;hew and decora|tion of the Italian opera, with the pro|priety and declamation of French perfor|mance. Our &s;tage is more magnificent than any other in Europe, and the peo|ple in general fonder of theatrical enter|tainment. But as our plea&s;ures, as well as more important concerns, are general|ly managed by party, the &s;tage is &s;ubject to its influence. The managers, and all who e&s;pou&s;e their &s;ide, are for decoration and ornament; the critic, and all who have &s;tudied French decorum, are for re|gularity and declamation. Thus it is al|mo&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="168">
impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e both parties, and the poet, by attempting it, finds him|&s;elf often incapable of plea&s;ing either. If he introduces &s;tage pomp, the critic con|&s;igns his performance to the vulgar; if he indulges in recital, and &s;implicity, he is accu&s;ed of in&s;ipidity or dry af|fectation.</P>
<P>FROM the nature therefore of our thea|tre, and the genius of our country, it is extremely difficult for a dramatic poet to plea&s;e his audience. But happy would he be were the&s;e the only difficulties he had to encounter; there are many other more dangerous combinations again&s;t the little wit of the age. Our poet's performance mu&s;t undergo a proce&s;s truly chymical before it is pre&s;ented to the public. It mu&s;t be tried in the manager's fire, &s;train|ed
<PB N="162" REF="169">
through a licen&s;er, and purified in the Review, or the news-paper of the day. At this rate, before it can come to a private ta|ble, it may probably be a mere caput mor|tuum, and only proper entertainment for the licen&s;er, manager, or critic him&s;elf. But it may be an&s;wered, that we have a &s;ufficient number of plays upon our theatres already, and therefore there is no need of new ones. But are they &s;ufficiently good? And is the credit of our age nothing? Mu&s;t our pre&s;ent times pa&s;s away unnoticed by po&s;terity? We are de&s;irous of leaving them liberty, wealth, and titles, and we can have no recom|pence but their applau&s;e. The title of Learned given to an age, is the mo&s;t glori|ous applau&s;e, and &s;hall this be di&s;regarded? Our reputation among foreigners will quick|ly be di&s;continued, when we di&s;continue our efforts to de&s;erve it, and &s;hall we de&s;pi&s;e their
<PB N="163" REF="170">
prai&s;e? Are our new ab&s;urdities, with which no nation more abounds, to be left unno|ticed? Is the plea&s;ure &s;uch performances give upon the peru&s;al, to be entirely given up? If the&s;e are all matters of indifference, it then &s;ignifies nothing, whether we are to be entertained with the actor or the poet, with fine &s;entiments, or painted canvas, or whether the dancer, or the carpenter, be con&s;tituted ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>BUT they are not matters of indiffe|rence. Every age produces new follies and new vices, and one ab&s;urdity is often di&s;placed in order to make room for ano|ther. The dramatic poet, however, who &s;hould be, and has often been, a firm champion in the cau&s;e of virtue, detects all the new machinations of vice, levels his &s;atire at the ri&s;ing &s;tructures of folly,
<PB N="164" REF="171">
or drives her from behind the retrench|ments of fa&s;hion. Thus far then, the poet is u&s;eful; but how far the actor, that dear favourite of the public, may be &s;o, is a que&s;tion, next to be deter|mined.</P>
<P>AS the poet's merit is often not &s;uf|ficient to introduce his performance among the public with proper dignity, he is often obliged to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of decoration and dre&s;s to contribute to this effect. By this means a performance, which plea&s;es on the &s;tage, often in&s;tructs in the clo&s;et, and for one who has &s;een it acted, hundreds will be readers. The actor then is u&s;eful, by introducing the works of the poet to the public with becoming &s;plen|dor; but when the&s;e have once become po|pular, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf &s;o much a &s;cep|tic,
<PB N="165" REF="172">
as to think it would be more for the in|tere&s;ts of virtue, if &s;uch performances were read, not acted; made rather our compa|nions in the clo&s;et, than on the theatre. While we are readers, every moral &s;en|timent &s;trikes us in all its beauty, but the love &s;cenes are frigid, tawdry, and di&s;gu&s;ting. When we are &s;pectators, all the per&s;ua&s;ives to vice receive an additional lu&s;tre. The love &s;cene is ag|gravated, the ob&s;cenity heightened, the be&s;t actors figure in the mo&s;t debauched characters, while the parts of dull mora|lity, as they are called, are thrown to &s;ome mouthing machine, who puts even virtue out of countenance, by his wretch|ed imitation. The principal performers find their intere&s;t in chu&s;ing &s;uch parts as tend to promote, not the benefit of &s;ociety, but their own reputation; and in
<PB N="166" REF="173">
u&s;ing arts which in&s;pire emotions very dif|ferent from tho&s;e of morality. How many young men go to the playhou&s;e &s;peculative|ly in love with the rule of right, but return home actually enamour'd of an actre&s;s?</P>
<P>I HAVE often attended to the reflec|tions of the company upon leaving the theatre; one actor had the fine&s;t pipe, but the other the mo&s;t melodious voice; one was a bewitching creature, another a charming devil; and &s;uch are generally our acqui&s;itions at the play-hou&s;e: It brings to my remembrance an old lady, who being pa&s;&s;ionately fond of a famous preacher, went every Sunday to church, but, &s;truck only with his graceful manner of delivery, di&s;regarded and forgot the truths of his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="174">
BUT it is needle&s;s to mention the incen|tives to vice which are found at the theatre, or the immorality of &s;ome of the per|formers. Such impeachments, though true, would be regarded as cant, while their ex|hibitions continue to amu&s;e. I would only infer from hence, that an actor is chiefly u&s;eful in introducing new performances upon the &s;tage, &s;ince the reader receives more benefit by peru&s;ing a well written play in his clo&s;et, than by &s;eeing it acted. I would al&s;o infer, that to the poet is to be a&s;cribed all the good that attends &s;eeing plays, and to the actor all the harm.</P>
<P>BUT how is this rule inverted on our thea|tres at pre&s;ent? Old pieces are revived, and &s;carce any new ones admitted; the actor is ever in our eye, and the poet &s;eldom per|mitted to appear; the public are again
<PB N="168" REF="175">
obliged to ruminate tho&s;e ha&s;hes of ab|&s;urdity, which were di&s;gu&s;ting to our an|ce&s;tors, even in an age of ignorance; and the &s;tage, in&s;tead of &s;erving the people, is made &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;ts of an avaricious few. We mu&s;t now tamely &s;ee the literary honours of our country &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that an actor may dine with elegance; we mu&s;t tamely &s;it and &s;ee the cele&s;tial mu&s;e made a &s;lave to the hi&s;trio|nic Daemon.</P>

What mu&s;t be done? only &s;it down contented,

<P>LET the reader &s;u&s;pend his cen&s;ure; I ad|mire the beauties of this great father of our &s;tage as much as they de&s;erve, but could wi&s;h, for the honour of our country, and for his honour too, that many of his &s;cenes were forgotten. A man blind of one eye, &s;hould always be painted in pro|file. Let the &s;pectator who a&s;&s;i&s;ts at any of the&s;e new revived pieces, only a&s;k him|&s;elf, whether he would approve &s;uch a performance if written by a modern poet; if he would not, then his applau&s;e proceeds merely from the &s;ound of a name and an empty veneration for antiquity. In fact, the revival of tho&s;e pieces of forced humour, far fetch'd conceit, and unnatural hyper|bole, which have been a&s;cribed to Shake|&s;pear,
<PB N="170" REF="177">
is rather gibbeting than rai&s;ing a &s;tatue to his memory; it is rather a trick of the actor, who thinks it &s;afe&s;t acting in exagge|rated characters, and who by out-&s;tepping nature, chu&s;es to exhibit the ridiculous outre of an harlequin under the &s;anction of this venerable name.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;trange vamp'd comedies, farcical tragedies, or what &s;hall I call them, &s;peak|ing pantomimes, have we not of late &s;een. No matter what the play may be, it is the actor who draws an audience. He throws life into all; all are in &s;pirits and merry, in at one door and out at another; the &s;pectator, in a fool's paradi&s;e, knows not what all this means till the la&s;t act concludes in matrimo|ny. The piece plea&s;es our critics, becau&s;e it talks old Engli&s;h; and it plea&s;es the galle|ries, becau&s;e it has fun. True ta&s;te, or even common &s;en&s;e, are out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="178">
BUT great art mu&s;t be &s;ometimes u&s;ed be|fore they can thus impo&s;e upon the public. To this purpo&s;e, a prologue written with &s;ome &s;pirit generally precedes the piece, to inform us that it was compo&s;ed by Shake|&s;pear, or old Ben, or &s;omebody el&s;e, who took them for his model. A face of iron could not have the a&s;&s;urance to avow di&s;like; the theatre has its partizans who under|&s;tand the force of combinations, trained up to vociferation, clapping of hands, and clattering of &s;ticks; and tho' a man might have &s;trength &s;ufficient to overcome a lion in &s;ingle combat, by an army even of mice, he may run the ri&s;k of being eaten up mar|row-bones and all.</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible that third nights are di&s;agreeable drawbacks upon the annual pro|fits of the &s;tage; I am confident, it is much
<PB N="172" REF="179">
more to the manager's advantage to furbi&s;h up all the lumber, which the good &s;en&s;e of our ance&s;tors, but for his care, had con|&s;ign'd to oblivion; it is not with him therefore, but with the public I would ex|po&s;tulate; they have a right to demand re&s;pect, and &s;ure tho&s;e new revived plays are no in&s;tances of the manager's defe|rence.</P>
<P>I HAVE been informed, that no new play can be admitted upon our theatre unle&s;s the author chu&s;es to wait &s;ome years, or to u&s;e the phra&s;e in fa&s;hion, till it comes to be played in turn. A poet thus can never expect to contract a fami|liarity with the &s;tage, by which alone he can hope to &s;ucceed, nor can the mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s relieve immediate want. Our Saxon ance&s;tors had but one name for a

wit and a witch. I will not di&s;pute the propriety of uniting tho&s;e characters then; but the man who under the pre&s;ent di&s;|couragements ventures to write for the &s;tage now, whatever claim he may have to the appellation of a wit, at lea&s;t, he has no right to be called a conjuror.</P>
<P>YET getting a play on even in three or four years, is a privilege re&s;erved only for the happy few who have the arts of court|ing the manager as well as the mu&s;e: who have adulation to plea&s;e his vanity, powerful patrons to &s;upport their merit, or money to indemnify di&s;appointment. The poet mu&s;t act like our beggars at Chri&s;tmas, who lay the fir&s;t &s;hilling on the plate for them&s;elves. Thus all wit is bani&s;hed from the &s;tage, except it be &s;upported by friends, or fortune, and poets are &s;eldom over-burthen|ed with either.</P>

<P>FROM all that has been &s;aid upon the &s;tate of our theatre, we may ea&s;ily fore|&s;ee, whether it is likely to improve or decline; and whether the free-born mu&s;e can bear to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e re&s;trictions, which avarice or power would impo&s;e. For the future, it is &s;omewhat unlikely, that he,
<PB N="178" REF="185">
who&s;e labours are valuable, or who knows their value, will turn to the &s;tage for either fame or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, when he mu&s;t at once flatter an actor, and plea&s;e an au|dience.</P>
<P>LET no manager impute this to &s;pleen, or di&s;appointment. I only a&s;&s;ert the claims of the public, and endeavour to vindicate a profe&s;&s;ion which has hitherto wanted a de|fender. A mean or mercenary conduct may continue for &s;ome time to triumph over oppo&s;ition, but it is po&s;&s;ible the public will at la&s;t be taught to vindicate their pri|vileges. Perhaps, there may come a time, when the poet will be at liberty to en|crea&s;e the entertainments of the people; but &s;uch a period may po&s;&s;ibly not ari&s;e till our di&s;couragements have bani&s;hed poetry from the &s;tage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. On UNIVERSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of lo&s;ing my&s;elf in a &s;ubject of &s;uch extent, I &s;hall only offer a few thoughts as they occur, and leave their connection to the reader.</P>
<P>WE &s;eem divided, whether an educa|tion formed by travelling, or by a &s;eden|tary life, be preferable. We &s;ee more of the world by travel, but more of human na|ture by remaining at home. As in an infirmary, the &s;tudent who only attends to the di&s;orders of a few patients, is more likely to under&s;tand his profe&s;&s;ion, than he who indi&s;criminately examines them all.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="187">
A YOUTH ju&s;t landed at the Brille re|&s;embles a clown at a puppet-&s;hew; car|ries his amazement from one miracle to another; from this cabinet of curio&s;ities, to that collection of pictures: but won|dering is not the way to grow wi&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER re&s;olutions we &s;et our|&s;elves not to keep company with our countrymen abroad, we &s;hall find them broken when once we leave home. A|mong &s;trangers, we con&s;ider our&s;elves as in a &s;olitude, and 'tis but natural to de&s;ire &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IN all the great towns of Europe, there are to be found Engli&s;hmen re&s;iding either from intere&s;t or choice; the&s;e generally lead a life of continued debauchery; &s;uch are the
<PB N="181" REF="188">
countrymen a traveller is likely to meet with.</P>
<P>THIS may be the rea&s;on why Engli&s;h|men are all thought to be mad, or melan|cholly, by the vulgar abroad. Their money is giddily and merrily &s;pent among &s;harpers of their own country, and when that is gone, of all nations, the Engli&s;h bear wor&s;t that di&s;order called the <HI>maladie du poche.</HI></P>
<P>COUNTRIES wear very different appear|ances to travellers of different circum|&s;tances. A man who is whirled through Europe in a po&s;t chai&s;e, and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot, will form very different conclu&s;ions.</P>
<Q>Haud inexpertus loquor.</Q>
<P><PB N="182" REF="189">
To &s;ee Europe with advantage, a man &s;hould appear in various circum&s;tances of fortune, but the experiment would be too dangerous for young men.</P>
<P>THERE are many things relative to other countries, which can be learned to more advantage at home; their laws and policies are among the number.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t advantages which re&s;ult to youth from travel, is an ea&s;y addre&s;s, the wearing off national prejudices, and the finding nothing ridiculous in national pecu|liarities. The time &s;pent in the&s;e acqui|&s;itions, could have been more u&s;efully em|ployed at home. An education in a col|lege &s;eems, therefore, preferable.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="190">
IT has lately been di&s;puted, whether the arts and &s;ciences do mo&s;t benefit, or in|jury to mankind. Mere &s;peculative tri|fling. A&s;k the hou&s;e-breaker or highway|man, in what univer&s;ity they were bred. They will an&s;wer, In none.</P>
<P>WE attribute to univer&s;ities either too much or too little. Some a&s;&s;ert, that they are the only proper places to advance learn|ing; while others deny even their utility in forming an education. Both are er|roneous.</P>
<P>LEARNING is mo&s;t advanced in popu|lous cities, where chance often con&s;pires with indu&s;try to promote it; where the members of this larger univer&s;ity, if I may &s;o call it, catch manners as they ri&s;e,
<PB N="184" REF="191">
&s;tudy life, not logic, and have the world for corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t number of univer&s;ities have ever been founded in times of the greate&s;t ignorance.</P>
<P>NEW improvements in learning, are &s;el|dom adopted in colleges, until admitted every where el&s;e. And this is right; we &s;hould always be cautious of teaching the ri&s;ing generation uncertainties for truth.</P>
<P>THOUGH the profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities have been too frequently found to op|po&s;e the advancement of learning; yet when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, they are the propere&s;t per&s;ons to diffu&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="192">
THE rudiments of learning are be&s;t im|planted in a college, the cultivation of it is be&s;t promoted in the world.</P>
<P>THERE is more knowlege to be ac|quired from one page of the volume of mankind, if the &s;cholar only knows how to read, than in volumes of antiquity; we grow learned, not wi&s;e, by too long a con|tinuance at college.</P>
<P>THIS points out the time in which we &s;hould leave the univer&s;ity; perhaps, the age of twenty-one, when at our univer|&s;ities the fir&s;t degree is generally taken, is the proper period.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;ities of Europe may be di|vided into three cla&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e upon the old &s;chola&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment, where the pu|pils
<PB N="186" REF="193">
are immured, talk nothing but Latin, and &s;upport every day &s;yllogi&s;tical di&s;pu|tations in &s;chool philo&s;ophy. Would not one be apt to imagine, this was the proper education to make a man a fool! Such are the univer&s;ities of Prague, Louvain, and Padua. The &s;econd is, where the pupils are under few re&s;trictions; where all &s;chola&s;|tic jargon is bani&s;hed, where they take a de|gree when they think proper, and live not in the college but city. Such are Edinburgh, Leyden, Gottingen, Geneva. The third is a mixture of the two former, where the pupils are re&s;trained, but not confined; where many, though not all, the ab&s;ur|dities of &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy are &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed, and where the fir&s;t degree is taken after four years matriculation. Such are Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="194">
AS for the fir&s;t cla&s;s, their ab&s;urdities are too apparent to admit of a parallel. It is di&s;puted, which of the two la&s;t are mo&s;t conducive to national improvement</P>
<P>SKILL in the profe&s;&s;ions is acquired more by practice than &s;tudy, two or three years may be &s;ufficient for learning their rudiments. The univer&s;ities of Edinburgh, &amp;c. grant a licence for practi&s;ing them, when the &s;tudent thinks proper, which our univer&s;ities refu&s;e till after a re&s;idence of &s;everal years.</P>
<P>THE dignity of the profe&s;&s;ions may be &s;upported by this dilatory proceeding, but many men of learning are thus too long excluded from the lucrative advantages, which &s;uperior &s;kill has a right to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="195">
THOSE univer&s;ities mu&s;t certainly be mo&s;t frequented, who promi&s;e to give in two years the advantages, which others will not under twelve.</P>
<P>THE man who has &s;tudied a profe&s;&s;ion for three years, and practi&s;ed it for nine more, will certainly know more of his bu&s;ine&s;s, than he who has only &s;tudied it for twelve.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;ities of Edinburgh, &amp;c. mu&s;t certainly be mo&s;t proper for the &s;tudy of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, in which men chu&s;e to turn their learning to profit as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;ities of Oxford, &amp;c. are improper for this, &s;ince they keep the &s;tu|dent from the world, which, after a cer|tain
<PB N="189" REF="196">
time, is the only true &s;chool of im|provement.</P>
<P>WHEN a degree in the profe&s;&s;ions can be taken only by men of independent for|tune, the number of candidates in learn|ing is le&s;&s;ened, and con&s;equently the ad|vancement of learning retarded.</P>
<P>THIS &s;lowne&s;s of conferring degrees is a remnant of &s;chola&s;tic barbarity. Paris, Louvain, and tho&s;e univer&s;ities which &s;till retain their ancient in&s;titutions, confer the doctor's degree &s;lower even than we.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatutes of every univer&s;ity &s;hould be con&s;idered as adapted to the laws of its re&s;pective government. Tho&s;e &s;hould alter as the&s;e happen to fluctuate.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="197">
FOUR years &s;pent in the arts (as they are called in colleges) is, perhaps, laying too laborious a foundation. Entering a profe&s;&s;ion without any previous acqui&s;i|tions of this kind, is building too bold a &s;uper&s;tructure.</P>
<P>TEACHING by lecture, as at Edinburgh, may make men &s;cholars, if they think proper; but in&s;tructing by examination, as at Oxford, will make them &s;o, often again&s;t their inclination.</P>
<P>EDINBURGH only di&s;po&s;es the &s;tudent to receive learning; Oxford often makes him actually learned.</P>
<P>IN a word, were I poor, I &s;hould &s;end my &s;on to Leyden, or Edinburgh, tho' the annual expence in either, particular|ly
<PB N="191" REF="198">
in the fir&s;t, is very great. Were I rich, I would &s;end him to one of our own univer&s;ities. By an education re|ceived in the fir&s;t, he has the be&s;t like|lihood of living; by that received in the latter, he has the be&s;t chance of becom|ing great.</P>
<P>WE have of late heard much of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tudying oratory. Ve&s;pa&s;ian was the fir&s;t who paid profe&s;&s;ors of rhe|toric, for publicly in&s;tructing youth at Rome. However tho&s;e pedants never made an orator.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t orations that ever were &s;po|ken, were pronounced in the parlia|ments of King Charles the fir&s;t. The&s;e men never &s;tudied the rules of oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199">
MATHEMATICS are, perhaps, too much &s;tudied at our univer&s;ities. This &s;eems a &s;cience, to which the meane&s;t intellects are equal. I forget who it is that &s;ays, <Q>'All men might under&s;tand mathematics, if they would.'</Q></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t methodical manner of lec|turing, whether on morals or nature, is fir&s;t rationally to explain, and then pro|duce the experiment. The mo&s;t in&s;truc|tive method is to &s;hew the experiment fir&s;t; curio&s;ity is then excited and atten|tion awakened to every &s;ub&s;equent de|duction. From hence, it is evident, that in a well formed education, a cour&s;e of hi&s;tory &s;hould ever precede a cour&s;e of ethics.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="200">
THE &s;ons of our nobility are permitted to enjoy greater liberties in our univer|&s;ities, than tho&s;e of private men. I &s;hould blu&s;h to a&s;k the men of learning and vir|tue, who pre&s;ide in our &s;eminaries, the rea&s;on of &s;uch a prejudicial di&s;tinction. Our youth &s;hould there be in&s;pired with a love of philo&s;ophy: and the fir&s;t maxim among philo&s;ophers is, that merit only makes di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>WHENCE has proceeded the vain mag|nificence of expen&s;ive architecture in our colleges? Is it, that men &s;tudy to more advantage in a palace than in a cell? One &s;ingle performance of ta&s;te, or genius, confers more real honours on its parent univer&s;ity, than all the labours of the chi&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="201">
SURE pride it&s;elf has dictated to the fellows of our colleges, the ab&s;urd pa&s;&s;ion of being attended at meals, and on other public occa&s;ions, by tho&s;e poor men, who, willing to be &s;cholars, come in upon &s;ome charitable foundation. It implies a contra|diction, for men to be at once learning the <HI>liberal</HI> arts, and at the &s;ame time treated as <HI>&s;laves,</HI> at once &s;tudying freedom, and prac|ti&s;ing &s;ervitude.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY &s;ubject acquires an adven|titious importance to him who con|&s;iders it with application. He finds it more clo&s;ely connected with human hap|pine&s;s, than the re&s;t of mankind are apt to allow; he &s;ees con&s;equences re&s;ulting from it, which do not &s;trike others with equal conviction, and &s;till pur&s;uing &s;pe|culation beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, too frequently becomes ridiculou&s;ly earne&s;t in trifles, or ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be incurring this im|putation, to deduce an univer&s;al degeneracy of manners, from &s;o &s;l&icirc;ght an origin as the
<PB N="196" REF="203">
depravation of ta&s;te; to a&s;&s;ert, that as a nation grows dull, it &s;inks into debauchery. Yet &s;uch, probably, may be the con&s;e|quence of literary decay; or, not to &s;tretch the thought beyond what it will bear, vice and &s;tupidity are always mutually produc|tive of each other.</P>
<P>LIFE at the greate&s;t and be&s;t, has been compared to a froward child, that mu&s;t be humoured, and play'd with, till it falls a&s;leep, and then all the care is over. Our few years are laboured away in varying its plea&s;ures; new amu&s;ements are pur&s;ued with &s;tudious attention; the mo&s;t childi&s;h vanities are dignified with titles of impor|tance; and the proude&s;t boa&s;t of the mo&s;t a&s;piring philo&s;opher is no more than that he provides his little playfellows the greate&s;t pa&s;time with the greate&s;t innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="204">
THUS the mind ever wandering after a|mu&s;ement, when abridged of happine&s;s on one part, endeavours to find it on another, when intellectual plea&s;ures are di&s;agreeable, tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e will take the lead. The man, who, in this age, is enamoured of the tranquil joys of &s;tudy and retirement, may, in the next, &s;hould learning be fa&s;hionable no longer, feel an ambition of being foremo&s;t at an hor&s;e-cour&s;e; or if &s;uch could be the ab|&s;urdity of the times, of being him&s;elf a jockey. Rea&s;on and appetite are there|fore ma&s;ters of our revels in turn; and as we incline to the one, or pur&s;ue the other, we rival angels, or imitate the brutes. In the pur&s;uit of intellectual plea|&s;ure, lies every virtue; of &s;en&s;ual, every vice.</P>
<P>IT is this difference of pur&s;uit, which marks the morals and characters of man|kind;
<PB N="198" REF="205">
which lays the line between the enlightened philo&s;opher, and the half|taught citizen; between the civil citizen and the illiterate pea&s;ant; between the law-obeying pea&s;ant, and the wandering &s;a|vage of Africa, an animal le&s;s mi&s;chievous indeed, than the tyger, becau&s;e endued with fewer powers of doing mi&s;chief. The man, the nation, mu&s;t therefore be good, who&s;e chiefe&s;t luxuries con&s;i&s;t in the re|finement of rea&s;on; and rea&s;on can never be univer&s;ally cultivated unle&s;s guided by Ta&s;te, which may be con&s;idered as the link between &s;cience and common &s;en&s;e, the medium through which learning &s;hould ever be &s;een by &s;ociety.</P>
<P>TASTE will, therefore, often be a pro|per &s;tandard, when others fail, to judge of a nation's improvement, or degeneracy
<PB N="199" REF="206">
in morals. We have often no permanent characteri&s;tics by which to compare the vir|tues or the vices of our ance&s;tors with our own; a generation may ri&s;e and pa&s;s away, without leaving any traces of what it really was, and all complaints of our deterioration, may be only topics of declamation, or the cavillings of di&s;appointment: but in ta&s;te, we have &s;tanding evidence, we can, with preci&s;ion, compare the literary performances of our fathers with our own, and from their excellence, or defects, determine the moral, as well as the literary merits of either.</P>
<P>IF then, there ever comes a time, when ta&s;te is &s;o far depraved among us, that critics &s;hall load every work of genius with unnece&s;&s;ary comment, and quarter their empty performances, with the &s;ub|&s;tantial merit of an author, both for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="200" REF="207">
and applau&s;e; if there comes a time, when cen&s;ure &s;hall &s;peak in &s;torms, but prai&s;e be whi&s;pered in the breeze, while real excellence often finds &s;hipwreck in either; if there be a time, when the mu&s;e &s;hall &s;eldom be heard, except in plaintive elegy, as if &s;he wept her own decline, while lazy compilations &s;upply the place of original thinking; &s;hould there ever be &s;uch a time, may &s;ucceeding critics, both for the honour of our morals as well as our learning, &s;ay, that &s;uch a period bears no re&s;emblance to the pre&s;ent age.</P>
