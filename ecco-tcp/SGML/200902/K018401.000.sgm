<P>THE GOOD NATUR'D MAN: A COMEDY. As Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>BY MR. GOLDSMITH.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for W. GRIFFIN, in Catharine-Street, Strand. MDCCLXVIII.</P>

<PB REF="2">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I confe&s;s I was &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the poets of the la&s;t age, and &s;trove to imitate them. The term, <HI>genteel comedy,</HI> was then unknown among&s;t us, and little more was de&s;ired by an audience, than nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they were mo&s;t con|&s;picuous. The author of the following &s;cenes never imagined that more would be expected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim. Tho&s;e who know any thing of compo&s;ition, are &s;en&s;ible, that in pur&s;uing humour, it will &s;ometimes lead us into the rece&s;&s;es of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the ma&s;ter of a &s;punging-hou&s;e: but in deference to the public ta&s;te, grown of late, perhaps, too delicate; the &s;cene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the repre&s;entation. In deference al&s;o to the judgment of a few friends, who think in a par|ticular way, the &s;cene is here re&s;tored. The author &s;ubmits it to the reader in his clo&s;et; and hopes that too much refinement will not bani&s;h humour and character from our's, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now become &s;o very elevated and &s;entimental, that it has not only bani&s;hed humour and <HI>Moliere</HI> from the &s;tage, but it has bani&s;hed all &s;pectators too.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="3">
Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good Natur'd Man has met with; and to Mr. Colman in particular, for his kindne&s;s to it. It may not al&s;o be improper to a&s;&s;ure any, who &s;hall hereafter write for the theatre, that merit, or &s;uppo&s;ed merit, will ever be a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port to his protection.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY DR. JOHNSON: SPOKEN BY MR. BENSLEY.</BYLINE>
<L>PREST by the load of life, the weary mind</L>
<L>Surveys the general toil of human kind;</L>
<L>With cool &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion joins the labouring train,</L>
<L>And &s;ocial &s;orrow, lo&s;es half it's pain:</L>
<L>Our anxious Bard, without complaint, may &s;hare</L>
<L>This bu&s;tling &s;ea&s;on's epidemic care.</L>
<L>Like Cae&s;ar's pilot, dignified by fate,</L>
<L>To&s;t in one common &s;torm with all the great;</L>
<L>Di&s;tre&s;t alike, the &s;tate&s;man and the wit,</L>
<L>When one a borough courts, and one the pit.</L>
<L>The bu&s;y candidates for power and fame,</L>
<L>Have hopes, and fears, and wi&s;hes, ju&s;t the &s;ame;</L>
<L>Di&s;abled both to combat, or to fly,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t hear all taunts, and hear without reply.</L>
<L>Uncheck'd on both, loud rabbles vent their rage,</L>
<L>As mongrels bay the lion in a cage.</L>
<L>Th' offended burge&s;s hoards his angry tale,</L>
<L>For that ble&s;t year when all that vote may rail;</L>

<L>Lies at my feet, I hi&s;s him, and he dies.</L>
<L>The great, 'tis true, can charm th' electing tribe;</L>
<L>The bard may &s;upplicate, but cannot bribe.</L>
<L>Yet judg'd by tho&s;e, who&s;e voices ne'er were &s;old,</L>
<L>He feels no want of ill per&s;uading gold;</L>

<HEAD>ACT THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SCENE, An Apartment in YOUNG HONEY|WOOD's Hou&s;e.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter SIR WILLIAM HONEYWOOD, JARVIS.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this hone&s;t bluntne&s;s. Fidelity, like yours, is the be&s;t excu&s;e for every freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help being blunt, and being very an|gry too, when I hear you talk of di&s;inheriting &s;o good, &s;o worthy a young gentleman as your nephew, my ma&s;ter. All the world loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;ure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are, tho' he has not &s;een you &s;ince he was a child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ignifies his affection to me, or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every &s;harper and coxcomb find an ea&s;y entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that he's rather too good natur'd; that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs this minute with one, and cries the next with an|other; but who&s;e in&s;tructions may he thank for all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, &s;ure? My letters to him during my employment in Italy, taught him only that phi|lo&s;ophy which might prevent, not defend his errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm &s;orry they taught him any philo&s;ophy at all; it has only &s;erv'd to &s;poil him. This &s;ame philo&s;ophy is a good hor&s;e in the &s;table, but an errant jade on a jour|ney. For my own part, whenever I hear him men|tion the name on't, I'm always &s;ure he's going to play the fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us a&s;cribe his faults to his philo|&s;ophy, I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature ari&s;es rather from his fears of offending the importu|nate, than his de&s;ire of making the de&s;erving happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>What it ri&s;es from, I don't know. But, to be &s;ure, every body has it, that a&s;ks it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or that does not a&s;k it. I have been now for &s;ome time a concealed &s;pectator of his follies, and find them as boundle&s;s as his di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, faith, he has &s;ome fine name or other for them all. He calls his extravagance, gene|ro&s;ity; and his tru&s;ting every body, univer&s;al bene|volence. It was but la&s;t week he went &s;ecurity for a fellow who&s;e face he &s;carce knew, and that he call'd an act of exalted mu&mdash;mu&mdash;munificence; ay, that was the name he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon that I proceed, as my la&s;t effort, tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very fellow has ju&s;t ab&s;conded, and I have taken up the &s;ecurity. Now, my intention is to involve him in fictitious di&s;tre&s;s, before he has plunged him&s;elf into real calamity. To arre&s;t him for that very debt, to clap an officer upon him, and then let him &s;ee which of his friends will come to his relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I could but any way &s;ee him tho|roughly vexed, every groan of his would be mu&s;ic to me; yet faith, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible. I have tried to fret him my&s;elf every morning the&s;e three years; but, in&s;tead of being angry, he &s;its as calmly to hear me &s;cold, as he does to his hair-dre&s;&s;er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t try him once more, however, and I'll go this in&s;tant to put my &s;cheme into execu|tion; and I don't de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding, as, by your
<PB N="3" REF="8">
means, I can have frequent opportunities of being about him, without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis, that any man's good will to others &s;hould produce &s;o much neglect of him&s;elf, as to require correction. Yet, we mu&s;t touch his weakne&s;&s;es with a delicate hand. There are &s;ome faults &s;o nearly al|lied to excellence, that we can &s;carce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go thy ways, Sir William Honeywood. It is not without rea&s;on that the world allows thee to be the be&s;t of men. But here comes his hopeful nephew; the &s;trange good natur'd, fooli&s;h, open hearted&mdash;And yet, all his faults are &s;uch that one loves him &s;till the better for them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter HONEYWOOD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Jarvis, what me&s;&s;ages from my friends this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have no friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; from my acquaintance then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Pulling out bills)</STAGE> A few of our u&s;ual cards of compliment, that's all. This bill from your taylor; this from your mercer; and this from the little broker in Crooked-lane. He &s;ays he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know; but I'm &s;ure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has lo&s;t all patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he has lo&s;t a very good thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's that ten guineas you were &s;ending to the poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet. I believe that would &s;top his mouth for a while, at lea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Jarvis, but what will fill their mouths in the mean time? Mu&s;t I be cruel becau&s;e he hap|pens to be importunate; and, to relieve his avarice, leave them to in&s;upportable di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! Sir, the que&s;tion now is how to relieve your&s;elf. Your&s;elf&mdash;Hav'nt I rea&s;on to be out of my &s;en&s;es, when I &s;ee things going at &s;ixes and &s;evens?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever rea&s;on you may have for being out of your &s;en&s;es, I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite unrea&s;onable for continuing in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're the only man alive in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation that could do &s;o&mdash;Every thing upon the wa&s;te. There's Mi&s;s Richland and her fine fortune gone already, and upon the point of being given to your rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm no man's rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your uncle in Italy preparing to di&s;inherit you; your own fortune almo&s;t &s;pent; and nothing but pre&s;&s;ing creditors, fal&s;e friends, and a pack of drunken &s;ervants that your kindne&s;s has made unfit for any other family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they have the more occa&s;ion for being in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soh! What will you have done with him that I caught &s;tealing your plate in the pantry? In the fact; I caught him in the fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fact! If &s;o, I really think that we &s;hould pay him his wages, and turn him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;hall be turn'd off at Tyburn, the dog; we'll hang him, if it be only to frighten the re&s;t of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Jarvis: it's enough that we have lo&s;t what he has &s;tolen, let us not add to it the lo&s;s of a fellow creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine; well, here was the footman ju&s;t now, to complain of the butler; he &s;ays he does mo&s;t work, and ought to have mo&s;t wages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but ju&s;t; tho' perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, its the way with them all, from the &s;cullion to the privy-coun&s;ellor. If they have a bad ma&s;ter, they keep quarrelling with him; if they have a good ma&s;ter, they keep quarrelling with one another.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter BUTLER, drunk.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butler.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll not &s;tay in the family with Jonathan; you mu&s;t part with him, or part with me, that's the ex-ex-expo&s;ition of the matter, Sir.</P>

<P>Full and explicit enough. But what's his fault, good Philip?</P>

<P>Sir, he's given to drinking, Sir, and I &s;hall have my morals corrupted, by keeping &s;uch company.</P>

<P>Ha! Ha! He has &s;uch a diverting way&mdash;</P>

<P>I find my wines a going, Sir, and liquors don't go without mouths, Sir; I hate a drunkard, Sir.</P>

<P>Well, well, Philip, I'll hear you upon that another time, &s;o go to bed now.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>To bed! Let him go to the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Butler.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begging your honour's pardon, and begging your pardon ma&s;ter Jarvis, I'll not go to bed, nor to the devil neither. I have enough to do to mind my cellar. I forgot, your honour, Mr. Croaker is below. I came on purpo&s;e to tell you.</P>

<P>Why didn't you &s;hew him up, blockhead?</P>

<P>Ay, we have one or other of that family in this hou&s;e from morning till night. He comes on the old affair I &s;uppo&s;e. The match between his &s;on, that's ju&s;t returned from Paris, and Mi&s;s Richland, the young lady he's guardian to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;o. Mr. Croaker, knowing my friend&s;hip for the young lady, has got it into his head that I can per&s;uade her to what I plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jarvis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! If you lov'd your&s;elf but half as well as &s;he loves you, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee a marriage that would &s;et all things to rights again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love me! Sure, Jarvis, you dream. No, no; her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friend&s;hip&mdash;mere friend&s;hip. That &s;he is the mo&s;t lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with de&s;ire, I own. But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy, by a connection with one &s;o unworthy her merits as I am. No, Jarvis, it &s;hall be my &s;tudy to &s;erve her, even in &s;pite of my wi&s;hes; and to &s;ecure her happine&s;s, tho' it de&s;troys my own.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t own my old monitor is not en|tirely wrong. There is &s;omething in my friend Croaker's conver&s;ation that quite depre&s;&s;es me. His very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety, and his ap|pearance has a &s;tronger effect on my &s;pirits than an undertaker's &s;hop.&mdash;Mr. Croaker, this is &s;uch a &s;atisfaction&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plea&s;ant morning to Mr. Honeywood, and many of them. How is this! You look mo&s;t &s;hockingly to day my dear friend. I hope this weather does not affect your &s;pirits.

<P>I heartily concur in the wi&s;h, tho' I own not in your apprehen&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not! Indeed what &s;ignifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours? Taxes ri&s;ing and trade falling. Money flying out of the kingdom and Je&s;uits &s;warming into it. I know at this time no le&s;s than an hundred and

twenty-&s;even Je&s;uits between Charing-cro&s;s and Temple-bar.</P>

<P>The Je&s;uits will &s;carce pervert you or me I &s;hould hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what &s;ignifies whom they pervert in a country that has &s;carce any re|ligion to lo&s;e? I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no apprehen&s;ions for the ladies I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not. Indeed what &s;ignifies whe|ther they be perverted or no? The women in my time were good for &s;omething. I have &s;een a lady dre&s;t from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly. But now a-days the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them, except their faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, however the&s;e faults may be practi&s;ed abroad, you don't find them at home, either with Mrs. Croaker, Olivia or Mi&s;s Richland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>The be&s;t of them will never be canoniz'd for a &s;aint when &s;he's dead. By the bye, my dear friend, I don't find this match between Mi&s;s Rich|land and my &s;on much reli&s;h'd, either by one &s;ide or t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought otherwi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Mr. Honeywood, a little of your fine &s;erious advice to the young lady might go far: I know &s;he has a very exalted opinion of your un|der&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would not that be u&s;urping an au|thority that more properly belongs to your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend you know but little of my authority at home. People think, indeed, becau&s;e they &s;ee me come out in a morning thus, with a plea&s;ant face, and to make my friends merry, that all's well within. But I have cares that would break an heart of &s;tone. My wife has &s;o encroach'd upon every one of my privileges, that I'm now no more than a mere lodger in my own hou&s;e.</P>

<P>It's a melancholy con&s;ideration indeed, that our chief comforts often produce our greate&s;t anxie|ties, and that an encrea&s;e of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is but an inlet to new di&s;quietudes.</P>

<P>Ah, my dear friend, the&s;e were the very words of poor Dick Doleful to me not a week be|fore he made away with him&s;elf.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, my Leontine, how can I be chearful, when I have &s;o many terrors to oppre&s;s me? The fear of being detected by this family, and the ap|prehen&s;ions of a cen&s;uring world, when I mu&s;t be detected&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leont.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world, my love, what can it &s;ay? At wor&s;t it can only &s;ay that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you di&s;liked, you formed a re&s;olution of flying with the man of your choice; that you confided in his honour, and took refuge in this hou&s;e; the only one where your's could remain without cen&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But con&s;ider, Leontine, your di&s;obedience and my indi&s;cretion: your being &s;ent to France to bring home a &s;i&s;ter; and, in&s;tead of a &s;i&s;ter, bringing home&mdash;</P>

<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, 'till we our&s;elves think proper to make the di&s;covery. My &s;i&s;ter, you know, has been with her aunt, at Lyons, &s;ince &s;he was a child, and you find every creature in the family takes you for her.</P>

<P>There, there's my ma&s;ter-&s;troke. I have re&s;olved not to refu&s;e her; nay, an hour hence I

<P>Don't be alarm'd, my deare&s;t. Can Olivia think &s;o meanly of my honour, or my love, as to &s;uppo&s;e I could ever hope for happine&s;s from any but her? No, my Olivia, neither the force, nor, permit me to add, the delicacy of my pa&s;&s;ion, leave any room to &s;u&s;pect me. I only offer Mi&s;s Richland an heart, I am convinc'd &s;he will refu&s;e; as I am confident, that without knowing it, her affections are fixed upon Mr. Honeywood.</P>

<P>You view them with too much partiality. However, by making this offer, I &s;hew a &s;eeming compliance with my father's commands, and perhaps upon her refu&s;al I may have his con&s;ent to chu&s;e for my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;ubmit. And yet, my Leontine, I own, I &s;hall envy her, even your pretended ad|dre&s;&s;es. I con&s;ider every look, every expre&s;&s;ion of your e&s;teem, as due only to me. This is folly per|haps: I allow it; but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that merit which has made an impre&s;&s;ion on ones own heart, may be powerful over that of another.</P>

<P>Don't, my life's trea&s;ure, don't let us make imaginary evils, when you know we have &s;o many real ones to encounter. At wor&s;t, you know, if Mi&s;s Richland &s;hould con&s;ent, or my father refu&s;e his pardon, it can but end in a trip to Scotland; and&mdash;</P>

<P>DEAR NICK, <HI>An Engli&s;h gentleman, of large fortune, has for &s;ome time made private, tho' honourable propo&s;als to your daughter Olivia. They love each other tenderly, and I find &s;he has con&s;ented, without letting any of the family know, to crown his addre&s;&s;es. As &s;uch good offers don't come every day, your own good &s;en&s;e, his large fortune, and family con&s;iderations, will induce you to forgive her&mdash;Yours ever&mdash;</HI>RACHEL CROAKER.</P>
<P>My daughter, Olivia, privately contracted to a man of large fortune! This is good news indeed. Oh! My heart never foretold me of this. And yet, how &s;lily the little baggage has carried it &s;ince &s;he came home. Not a word on't to the old ones for the world. Yet, I thought, I &s;aw &s;omething &s;he wanted to conceal.</P>

<P>What, would you have me think of their funeral? But come, tell me, my dear, don't you owe more to me than you care to confe&s;s? Would you have ever been known to Mr. Lofty, who has un|dertaken Mi&s;s Richland's claim at the trea&s;ury, but for me? Who was it fir&s;t made him an acquaintance at Lady Shabbaroon's route? who got him to pro|mi&s;e us his intere&s;t? Is not he a back-&s;tairs favourite, one that can do what he plea&s;es with tho&s;e that do what they plea&s;e? Isn't he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a man of importance, I grant you. And yet, what amazes me is, that while he is giving away places to all the world, he can't get one for him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I vow to Gad, Madam, you make me blu&s;h. I'm nothing, nothing, nothing in the world; a mere ob&s;cure gentleman.

Yet, upon my &s;oul, I wonder what they &s;ee in me to treat me &s;o! Mea&s;ures, not men, have always been my mark; and I vow, by all that's honourable, my re&s;entment has never done the men, as mere men, any manner of harm&mdash;That is as mere men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What importance, and yet what mode&s;ty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, if you talk of mode&s;ty, Madam! There I own, I'm acce&s;&s;ible to prai&s;e. Mode&s;ty is my foible: It was &s;o, the Duke of Brentford u&s;ed to &s;ay of me. I love Jack Lofty, he u&s;ed to &s;ay: no man has a finer knowledge of things; quite a man of information; and when he &s;peaks upon his legs, by the lord he's

<P>O, there indeed I'm a bronze. Apropos, I have ju&s;t been mentioning mi&s;s Richland's ca&s;e to a certain per&s;onage; we mu&s;t name no names. When I a&s;k, I am not to be put off, madam.

<P>Why &s;o am I. The man, to be &s;ure, was immen&s;ely good natur'd. But then I could never find that he had any thing in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>His manner, to be &s;ure, was exce&s;&s;ive harmle&s;s; &s;ome, indeed, thought it a little dull. For my part, I always concealed my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can't be conceal'd, madam; the man was dull, dull as the la&s;t new comedy! A poor impracti|cable creature! I tried once or twice to know if he was fit for bu&s;ine&s;s; but he had &s;carce talents to be groom-porter to an orange barrow.</P>

<P>Let us now rather con&s;ider what's to be done. We have both di&s;&s;embled too long&mdash;I have always been a&s;ham'd&mdash;I am now quite weary of it. Sure I could never have undergone &s;o much for any other but you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why &s;hould we defer our &s;cheme of humble happine&s;s, when it is now in our power? I may be the favourite of your father, it is true; but can it ever be thought, that his pre&s;ent kindne&s;s

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leont.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many rea&s;ons to believe it will; as his attachments are but few, they are la&s;ting. His own marriage was a private one, as our's may be. Be&s;ides, I have &s;ounded him already at a di&s;tance, and find all his an&s;wers exactly to our wi&s;h. Nay, by an expre&s;&s;ion or two that drop'd from him, I am in|duced to think he knows of this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But that would be an happine&s;s too great to be expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>However it be, I'm certain you have power over him; and am per&s;uaded, if you inform'd him of our &s;ituation, that he would be di&s;po&s;ed to pardon it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Garnet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mean, Madam, why, what &s;hould it mean, but what Mr. Lofty &s;ent you here to &s;ee. The&s;e people he calls officers, are officers &s;ure enough: &s;heriff's officers; bailiffs, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, it is certainly &s;o. Well, tho' his perplexities are far from giving me plea&s;ure; yet, I own there's &s;omething very ridiculous in them, and a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for his di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Garnet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o they are. But I wonder, Madam, that the lawyer you ju&s;t employed to pay his debts, and &s;et him free, has not done it by this time. He ought at lea&s;t to have been here before now. But lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles, than out of them.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter SIR WILLIAM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Mi&s;s Richland to undertake &s;etting him free, I own, was quite unexpected. It has totally unhinged my &s;chemes to reclaim him. Yet, it gives me plea&s;ure to find, that among a number of worthle&s;s friend&s;hips, he has made one acqui&s;ition of real value; for there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ofter pa&s;|&s;ion on her &s;ide that prompts this genero&s;ity. Ha! here before me. I'll endeavour to &s;ound her affections.
<PB N="38" REF="45">
Madam, as I am the per&s;on that have had &s;ome de|mands upon the gentleman of this hou&s;e; I hope you'll excu&s;e me, if, before I enlarged him, I wanted to &s;ee your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>The precaution was very unnece&s;&s;ary, Sir. I &s;uppo&s;e your wants were only &s;uch as my agent had power to &s;atisfy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Partly, Madam. But, I was al&s;o willing you &s;hould be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to &s;erve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mu&s;t come, Sir, with a very ill grace from you. To cen&s;ure it, after what you have done, would look like malice; and to &s;peak favourably of a character you have oppre&s;&s;ed, would be impeaching your own. And &s;ure, his tenderne&s;s, his humanity, his univer&s;al friend&s;hip, may atone for many faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That friend&s;hip, Madam, which is exert|ed in too wide a &s;phere, become totally u&s;ele&s;s. Our bounty, like a drop of water, di&s;appears when dif|fu&s;ed too widely. They, who pretend mo&s;t to this univer&s;al benevolence, are either deceivers, or dupes. Men who de&s;ire to cover their private ill-nature, by a pretended regard for all; or, men who, rea&s;oning them&s;elves into fal&s;e feelings are more earne&s;t in pur&s;uit of &s;plendid, than of u&s;eful virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s. Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Sir, to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others, &s;o fevere in his cen&s;ure of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever I may have gained by folly, Madam, you &s;ee I am willing to prevent your lo&s;ing by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your cares for me, Sir, are unnece&s;&s;ary. I always &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e &s;ervices which are denied where they are wanted, and offered, perhaps, in hopes of a refu&s;al. No, Sir, my directions have been given, and I in&s;i&s;t upon their being complied with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou amiable woman. I can no longer contain the expre&s;&s;ions of my gratitude: my plea|&s;ure. You &s;ee before you, one who has been equally careful of his intere&s;t: one, who has for &s;ome time
<PB N="39" REF="46">
been a concealed &s;pectator of his follies, and only puni&s;hed, in hopes to reclaim them&mdash;His uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir William Honeywood! You amaze me. How &s;hall I conceal my confu&s;ion? I fear, Sir, you'll think I have been too forward in my &s;ervices. I confe&s;s I&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't make any apologies, Madam. I only find my&s;elf unable to repay the obligation. And yet, I have been trying my intere&s;t of late to &s;erve you. Having learnt, Madam, that you had &s;ome demands upon government, I have, tho' una&s;ked, been your &s;olicitor there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'm infinitely obliged to your in|tentions. But my guardian has employed another gentleman who a&s;&s;ures him of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, the important little man that vi&s;its here! Tru&s;t me, Madam, he's quite contemptible among men in power, and utterly unable to &s;erve you. Mr. Lofty's promi&s;es are much better known to people of fa&s;hion, than his per&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

<P>Let the chariot&mdash;let my chariot drive off, I'll vi&s;it to his grace's in a chair. Mi&s;s Richland here before me. Punctual, as u&s;ual, to the calls of humanity. I'm very &s;orry, Madam, things of this kind &s;hould happen, e&s;pecially to a man I have &s;hewn every where, and carried among&s;t us as a particular acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Sir, you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Madam, what can a private man like me do? One man can't do every thing; and then, I do &s;o much in this way every day: Let me &s;ee, &s;omething con&s;iderable might be done for him
<PB N="40" REF="47">
by &s;ub&s;cription; it could not fail if I carried the li&s;t. I'll undertake to &s;et down a brace of Dukes, two dozen Lords, and half the lower hou&s;e, at my own peril.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after all, its more than probable, Sir, he might reject the offer of &s;uch powerful pa|tronage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, what can we do? You know I never make promi&s;es. In truth, I once or twice tried to do &s;omething with him in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s; but as I often told his uncle, Sir William Honeywood, the man was utterly impracticable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>His uncle; then that gentleman, I &s;up|po&s;e, is a particular friend of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning me, Sir&mdash;Yes, Madam, as I often &s;aid, my dear Sir William, you are &s;en&s;ible I would do any thing as far as my poor intere&s;t goes, to &s;erve your family; but what can be done; there's no procuring fir&s;t rate places, for ninth rate abilities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I have heard of Sir William Honey|wood; he's abroad in employment; he confided in your judgement, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, Madam; I believe Sir William had &s;ome rea&s;on to confide in my judgement; one little rea&s;on, perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, what was it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, but let it go no further; it was I procured him his place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Either you or I, Sir.</P>

<P>This, Mr. Lofty, was very kind, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did love him, to be &s;ure; he had &s;ome amu&s;ing qualities; no man was fitter to be toa&s;t|ma&s;ter to a club, or had a better head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>A better head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, at a bottle; to be &s;ure, he was as dull as a choice &s;pirit; but hang it, he was grateful, very grateful; and gratitude hides a multitude of faults.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lofty.</SPEAKER>
<P>A trifle, a mere trifle, among us of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; the truth is, he wanted dignity to fill up a greater.</P>

<P>I a&s;k pardon, Madam. Yet, from our long friend&s;hip, I pre&s;umed I might have &s;ome right to offer, without offence, what you may refu&s;e with|out offending.</P>

<P>Give them my money!&mdash;And pray, what right have they to my money?</P>

<P>And pray, what right then have you to my good humour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o your good humour advi&s;es me to part with my money? Why then, to tell your good humour a piece of my mind, I'd &s;ooner part with my wife. Here's Mr. Honeywood, &s;ee what he'll &s;ay to it. My dear Honeywood, look at this incen|diary letter dropped at my door. It will freeze you with terror; and yet lovey here can read it&mdash;Can read it, and laugh.</P>

<P>Yes, and &s;o will Mr. Honeywood.</P>

<P>Speak, Mr. Honeywood; is there any thing more fooli&s;h than my hu&s;band's fright upon this occa&s;ion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not become me to decide, Madam; but doubtle&s;s, the greatne&s;s of his terrors now, will but invite them to renew their villainy another time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, he'd be of my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir! do you maintain that I &s;hould lie down under &s;uch an injury, and &s;hew, neither by
<PB N="57" REF="64">
my tears, or complaints, that I have &s;omething of the &s;pirit of a man in me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir. You ought to make the loude&s;t complaints, if you de&s;ire redre&s;s. The &s;ure&s;t way to have redre&s;s, is to be earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, who&s;e opinion is he of now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't you think that laughing off our fears is the be&s;t way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the be&s;t, Madam, few can &s;ay; but I'll maintain it to be a very wi&s;e way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we're talking of the be&s;t. Surely the be&s;t way is to face the enemy in the field, and not wait till he plunders us in our very very bed-cham|ber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as to the be&s;t, that&mdash;that's a very wi&s;e way too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing be more ab&s;urd, than to double our di&s;tre&s;&s;es by our apprehen&s;ions, and put it in the power of every low fellow, that can &s;crawl ten words of wretched &s;pelling, to torment us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, nothing more ab&s;urd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! would it not be more ab&s;urd to de&s;pi&s;e the rattle till we are bit by the &s;nake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, perfectly ab&s;urd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are of my opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you reject mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven's forbid, Madam. No, &s;ure no rea|&s;oning can be more ju&s;t than yours. We ought cer|tainly to d&s;epi&s;e malice if we cannot oppo&s;e it, and not make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repo&s;e as the highwayman's pi&s;tol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! then you think I'm quite right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plague of plagues, we can't be both right. I ought to be &s;orry, or I ought to be glad. My hat mu&s;t be on my head, or my hat mu&s;t be off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="65">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Croaker</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, in two oppo&s;ite opinions, if one be perfectly rea&s;onable, the other can't be per|fectly right.</P>

<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why may not both be right, Madam: Mr. Croaker in earne&s;tly &s;eeking redre&s;s, and you in waiting the event with good humour? Pray let me &s;ee the letter again. I have it. This letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the Talbot inn. If it be indeed an incendiary letter, what if you and I, Sir, go there; and, when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty, &s;eize him?</P>

<P>My dear friend its the very thing; the very thing. While I walk by the door, you &s;hall plant your&s;elf in ambu&s;h near the bar; bur&s;t out upon the mi&s;creant like a ma&s;qued battery; extort a confe&s;&s;ion at once, and &s;o hang him up by &s;urpri&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I would not chu&s;e to exerci&s;e too much &s;everity. It is my maxim, Sir, that crimes ge|nerally puni&s;h them&s;elves.</P>

<P>I find, as you're for Scotland, Madam&mdash;But, that's no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; married, or not mar|ried, I a&s;k no que&s;tions. To be &s;ure, we had a &s;weet little couple &s;et off from this two days ago for the &s;ame place. The Gentleman, for a Taylor, was, to be &s;ure, as fine a &s;poken taylor, as ever blew froth from a full pot.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>May every thing you do prove as fortunate. Indeed, Leontine, we have been mo&s;t cruelly di&s;|appointed. Mr. Honeywood's bill upon the city, has, it &s;eems been prote&s;ted, and we have been utterly at a lo&s;s how to proceed.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leont.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no danger, tru&s;t me, my dear; there can be none: if Honeywood has acted with honour, and kept my father, as he promi&s;ed, in employment till we are out of danger, nothing can interrupt our journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Olivia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no doubt of Mr. Honeywood's &s;in|cerity, and even his de&s;ires to &s;erve us. My fears are from your father's &s;u&s;picions. A mind &s;o di&s;po&s;|ed to be alarmed without a cau&s;e, will be but too ready when there's a rea&s;on.</P>

<P>Why, let him, when we are out of his power. But, believe me, Olivia, you have no great

rea&s;on to dread his re&s;entment. His repining tem|per, as it does no manner of injury to him&s;elf, &s;o will it never do harm to others. He only frets to keep him&s;elf employed, and &s;colds for his private amu&s;e|ment.</P>

<P>My maid a&s;&s;ured me he was come to this inn, and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the kingdom, &s;ugge&s;ted the re&s;t. But what do I &s;ee, my guardian here before us! Who, my dear Sir, could have expected meeting you here; to what accident do we owe this plea&s;ure?</P>

<P>Then, Sir, I can inform you; and, tho' a &s;tranger, yet you &s;hall find me a friend to your fa|mily: it will be enough at pre&s;ent, to a&s;&s;ure you, that, both in point of birth and fortune, the young lady is at lea&s;t your &s;on's equal.

<P>Sir James Woodville! What, of the We&s;t?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Being left by him, I &s;ay, to the care of a mercenary wretch, who&s;e only aim was to &s;ecure her fortune to him&s;elf, &s;he was &s;ent into France, under pretence of education; and there every art

was tried to fix her for life in a convent, contrary to her inclinations. Of this I was informed upon my arrival at Paris; and, as I had been once her father's friend, I did all in my power to fru&s;trate her guardi|an's ba&s;e intentions. I had even meditated to re&s;cue her from his authority, when your &s;on &s;tept in with more plea&s;ing violence, gave her liberty, and you a daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Croaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I intend to have a daughter of my own chu&s;ing, Sir. A young lady, Sir, who&s;e for|tune, by my intere&s;t with tho&s;e that have intere&s;t, will be double what my &s;on has a right to expect. Do you know Mr. Lofty, Sir?</P>

<P>Ob&s;tinate man, &s;till to per&s;i&s;t in his out|rage! In&s;ulted by him, de&s;pis'd by all, I now be|gin to grow contemptible, even to my&s;elf. How have I &s;unk by too great an a&s;&s;iduity to plea&s;e! How have I overtax'd all my abilities, le&s;t the approbation of a &s;ingle fool &s;hould e&s;cape me! But all is now over; I have &s;urvived my reputation, my fortune, my friend&s;hips, and nothing remains henceforward for me but &s;olitude and repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it true, Mr. Honeywood, that you are &s;etting off, without taking leave of your friends? The report is, that you are quitting England. Can it be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; and tho' I am &s;o unhappy as to have fallen under your di&s;plea&s;ure, yet, thank Heaven, I leave you to happine&s;s; to one who loves you, and de&s;erves your love; to one who has power to procure you affluence, and genero&s;ity to improve your enjoyment of it.</P>

<P>I have the be&s;t a&s;&s;urances of it, his &s;erving me. He does indeed de&s;erve the highe&s;t happine&s;s, and that is in your power to confer.

<SPEAKER>Honeyw.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; my re&s;olution is fix'd. In|feriority among &s;trangers is ea&s;y; but among tho&s;e that once were equals, in&s;upportable. Nay, to &s;hew you how far my re&s;olution can go, I can now &s;peak with calmne&s;s of my former follies, my vanity, my di&s;&s;ipation, my weakne&s;s. I will even confe&s;s, that, among the number of my other pre&s;umptions, I had the in&s;olence to think of loving you. Yes, Madam, while I was pleading the pa&s;&s;ion of another, my heart was tortur'd with its own. But it is over, it was unworthy our friend&s;hip, and let it be forgotten.</P>

<P>But you'll forgive it, I know you will; &s;ince the confe&s;&s;ion &s;hould not have come from me even now, but to convince you of the &s;incerity of my intention of&mdash;never mentioning it more.</P>

I &s;aw with regret tho&s;e &s;plendid errors, that &s;till took name from &s;ome neighbouring duty. Your charity, that was but inju&s;tice; your benevolence, that was but weakne&s;s; and your friend&s;hip but credulity.
