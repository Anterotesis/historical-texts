Zounds, I'm as dry as touchwood, and to &s;ail at the rate of ten knots an hour, ever &s;tubble and farrow, from my own hou&s;e, but half a league on this &s;ide of Go&s;|port, and not to catch the&s;e de&s;erters that received the King's bounty and run from their &s;hips.</P>

Mi&s;s Amelia, by deceiving her with a &s;ham mar|riage, when you pa&s;&s;d your&s;elf for Capt. Sevmor, then putting to &s;ea, leaving her to break her heart, then marrying another lady.</P>

<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would, but for me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. you dragg'd me out by the ear, like a water dog. La&s;t week, becau&s;e you &s;aw the tenth bottle uncork'd, you ru&s;hed in among my friends, and ran away with me. and the next morning Capt. O'Shanaghan &s;ends me a challenge, for quitting my chair when he was toa&s;t-ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;o to &s;ave me from the head-ach, you'd like to have got my brains blown out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh. very well&mdash;be burnt in your bed, and tumble into the water, like a tight fellow as you are, and promi&s;e your&s;elf with &s;loe juice, &s;ee if John cares a piece of mouldy bi&s;cuit about it.

<P>Sir, I a&s;k your pardon; but by mak|ing your&s;elf my equal, I've got &s;o u&s;ed to fami|liarity, that I find it curs'd hard to &s;hake it off.</P>

My poor friend has often lent me his money; though he &s;uppo&s;ed me a poor needy devil, that could never be able to pay him. He &s;han't know who I am till it's in my power to &s;erve him; only the rogue always marr'd the grand de&s;ign of my frolic&mdash;I had no chance among the pretty women where he was; he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety. Tho' &s;o devili&s;h plea&s;ant in his quotations, which on the moment he da&s;hes in a parody whim&s;ically oppo&s;ite to every occa&s;ion as it happens, I hope he won't find the pur&s;e I've hid in his pocket be|fore we part.
