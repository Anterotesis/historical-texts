<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>INTERESTING particulars, and ge|nuine anecdotes, relative to ju&s;tly cele|brated per&s;onages, have been generally well received by the public. In <HI>political life,</HI> as well as in the <HI>republic</HI> of <HI>letters,</HI> few have been more admired than the late LORD CHESTERFIELD, and DAVID HUME. We have, accordingly, had their <HI>lives, letters,</HI> and characters pub|li&s;hed; or &s;upplements and apologies, &amp;c. concerning them, printed.</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t entertaining parts of the&s;e, the editor of the following
<PB N="vi" REF="4">&s;elections, has endeavoured to pre&s;ent to the public, which he hopes will be both <HI>entertaining</HI> and <HI>in&s;tructive.</HI> They are taken from different publications re&s;pect|ing Mr. HUME and LORD CHESTER|FIELD; or the mo&s;t amu&s;ing parts of the&s;e writings thrown together, in a &s;hort compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>life</HI> of HUME, already publi&s;hed, makes not a part of this work: but the particulars now in&s;erted concerning Mr. HUME'S death and funeral, with his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, cannot but prove a|greeable to many readers; as mu&s;t the reflections which are added on <HI>dedications,</HI> and <HI>certain authors.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, a compari&s;on at &s;ome length is made between LORD CHESTER|FIELD and Mr. HUME: An impartial
<PB N="vii" REF="5">character of the former is added, with occa&s;ional ob&s;ervations inter&s;per&s;ed, tend|ing to vindicate the dignity of the chri&s;|tian philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The whole is with great deference &s;ubmitted to the public, for who&s;e en|tertainment it was originally de&s;igned.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE can be no &s;tronger proof of the high e&s;timation in which Mr. Hume was held, and of his being con&s;idered as an extra|ordinary character, than the eager, yet, per|haps, idle curio&s;ity which the public enter|tained to learn the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances re&s;pecting his exit.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume's natural temper di&s;po&s;ed him to feel, with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, every thing which affected his literary fame; and notwith|&s;tanding his boa&s;ted equanimity, philo&s;ophy did not &s;hield him from the exce&s;&s;ive chagrin which he felt from tho&s;e arrows, which Envy and Prejudice darted at his reputation. Anxiety,
<PB N="2" REF="7">relative to his difference with the whim&s;ical Rou&s;|&s;eau extracted from him a per&s;onal, but com|plete ju&s;tification. The illiberal critici&s;ms which Mr: Gray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps the mercenary Ma&s;on is more de&s;erving of this cen&s;ure than Mr. Gray. In order to &s;well his volume, and to fill his pockets, the former has publi&s;hed a loo&s;e and de&s;ultory Corre&s;|pondence, which the latter never dreamt would &s;ee the light, and would have reprobated could he ever have conceived the idea of his wor&s;t papers being put to this ungenerous and ungrateful u&s;e.&mdash; Neverthele&s;s, in return to a benefactor, who conferred e&s;&s;ential favours upon him, Mr. Ma&s;on has, as far as he was able, &s;acri|ficed his patron's reputation at the &s;ordid altar of Plutus. The po&s;thumous Poetical Pieces of Mr. Gray, though infinitely valu|able, are few in number, and were not likely to an&s;wer the inter|e&s;ted purpo&s;es of the hungry Editor by much emolument. This gentleman, therefore, re&s;olving to e&s;tabli&s;h a literary property or e&s;tate, by the name and writings of another, which he hone&s;t|ly acquaint's us he was unable to perform by his own, has given to the world, with little labour, a large but meagre Quarto, containing &s;ome puerile letters, &s;uperior, however, to the Edi|tor's notes, with which they are garni&s;hed. And by entitling the&s;e "The Poems of Mr. Gray," led the public to buy up a large impre&s;&s;ion before the deception was di&s;covered. Thus has the in|genious Ma&s;on bartered the high poetical and literary reputation of of a worthy man who confided in him for <HI>money.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Quid non mortalia pectora coges.</L>
<L>Aun &s;acra fames?</L></Q></NOTE> threw out again&s;t him, in his Epi&s;tolary Corre&s;pondence, gave him much concern. He &s;aw, with mortification, the laurel wreath which Oxford weaved to cover the bald reputation of Beattie, <HI>his antagoni&s;t, not his rival.</HI> And &s;uch was the antipathy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Mr. Tytler,
<PB N="3" REF="8">the author of the Vindication of Mary Queen of Scots; that not &s;atisfied with a mo&s;t acri|monious note, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This note de&s;erves a place, as it will &s;how that even Mr. Hume him&s;elf could occa&s;ionally be guilty of, <Q><HI>the illiberal arro|gance, petulance and &s;currility which di&s;tingui&s;h the Warburtonian School.</HI></Q> <Q>But there is a per&s;on, that has writ an <Q>Enquiry, hi&s;torical and critical, into the evidence again&s;t Mary Queen of Scots;</Q> and has attempted to refute the foregoing narrative. He quotes a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age of the nanative in which Mary is &s;aid &s;imply to refu&s;e an&s;wering; and then a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age from Good|all, in which &s;he boa&s;ts &s;imply that &s;he will an&s;wer; and he very civilly and almo&s;t directly calls the author a liar, on account of this pretended contradiction. That whole Enquiry, from begin|ning to end, is compo&s;ed of &s;uch <HI>&s;candalous artifices.</HI> And from this in&s;tance, the reader may judge of the <HI>candour, fair deal|ing, veracity,</HI> and <HI>good manners</HI> of the Enquirer, there are, indeed, three events in our hi&s;tory, which may be regarded as touch&s;tones of party-men. An Engli&s;h Whig, who a&s;&s;erts the reality of the popi&s;h Plot, an Iri&s;h Catholic, who denies the ma&s;|&s;acre in 1641, and a Scotch Jacobite, who maintains the inno|cence of Queen Mary, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as men beyond the reach of argument or rea&s;on, and mu&s;t be left to their prejudices.</Q></NOTE> which he has publi&s;hed in the la&s;t edition of his Hi&s;tory, he would not even &s;it in company with him, and the appearance of the one effected the in&s;tantaneous withdraw|ing of the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume, in the Hi&s;tory of his Life, has not informed us of his having &s;tood candi|date for the Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of Moral Philo&s;ophy, in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh; of the oppo|&s;ition which the Scots clergy excited to his pre|ten&s;ions;
<PB N="4" REF="9">nor of the enquiry which was moved for in the venerable a&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scotland, re&s;pecting the principles incul|cated in his writings; and of the cen&s;ures pro|po&s;ed to be inflicted on him as the author of Heretical Doctrines.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;erved in the nineteenth page of his Life, that his Hi&s;tory of Great Britain met at fir&s;t with an indifferent reception. But with re&s;pect to this, Mr. Hume him&s;elf was mi&s;taken. The fir&s;t edition of the Hi&s;tory of Great Britain, for the reigns of James the Fir&s;t and Charles the Fir&s;t, was printed at Edin|burgh, A. D. 1754, for <HI>Hamilton, Balfour, and Neil.</HI> Hamilton, upon his expectations from this book, took a &s;hop, and &s;ettled in London. He applied to the London book&s;ellers to take copies of the Hi&s;tory from him, but none of them would deal with an <HI>interloper.</HI> Hamilton, &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, has recour&s;e to <HI>his friend,</HI> Mr. Millar; Millar <HI>obliges him</HI> by taking fifty copies: but when gentlemen, in his well-frequented &s;hop, a&s;ked for the book, <Q>Pho, (&s;ays Millar generou&s;ly) it is incomplete, another vo|lume is coming out &s;oon. You are wel|come to the u&s;e of this in the mean time.</Q> Thus did Millar circulate the fifty copies among &s;ome hundred readers, without &s;elling one,
<PB N="5" REF="10">And by this ingenious device attained his fa|vourite purpo&s;e, of getting Hamilton to &s;ell him his right in the copy for a trifle, as being an in&s;ignificant performance.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume, and the late Reverend Dr. Jar|dine, one of the mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, lived in habits of much intimacy. Religion, <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>revealed,</HI> was frequently the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation. It happened one night, after they had entertained them&s;elves with theological con|trover&s;y, that Mr. Hume's politene&s;s, when bidding adieu, would not permit Dr. Jardine (who&s;e oeconomy was not incumbered with many dome&s;ticks) to light him down &s;tairs. Mr. Hume &s;tumbled in the dark, and the Doc|tor hearing it, ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance with a candle, and when he had recovered, his gue&s;t &s;aid to him, <Q>David, I have often told you not to rely too much upon your&s;elf, and that <HI>natural light</HI> is not <HI>&s;ufficient.</HI></Q> This plea&s;antry Mr. Hume never reli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As a proof of the &s;teadine&s;s of Mr. Hume's &s;ceptical tenets it may be ob&s;erved, that when he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t volume of his Hi&s;tory of Great Britain, he was advi&s;ed, that the opi|nions he had delivered concerning matters of religion, would hurt the &s;ale of his work; and
<PB N="6" REF="11">that &s;ome apology would be proper. He ac|cordingly in his &s;econd volume, p. 449, when &s;peaking of the religious parties, &s;ubjoins the following note, which when his fame was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed beyond the reach of party, he cancelled as unworthy of admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<Q><P>This &s;ophi&s;m, of arguing from the abu&s;e of any thing again&s;t the u&s;e of it, is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, and at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t common, to which men are &s;ubject. The hi&s;tory all ages, and none more than that of the period, which is our &s;ubject, offers us examples of the abu&s;e of religion; and we have not been &s;paring, in this volume more than in the former, to remark them: But whoever would thence draw an inference to the di&s;advantage of religion in general, would argue very ra&s;hly and erroneou&s;ly. The proper office of religion is to reform mens lives, to purify their hearts, to inforce all moral duties, and to &s;ecure obedience to the laws and civil magi&s;trate. While it pur|&s;ues the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, its operations, tho' infinitely valuable, are &s;ecret and &s;ilent, and &s;eldom come under the cognizance of hi&s;tory. That adulterate &s;pecies of it alone, which inflames faction, animates &s;edition, and prompts rebellion, di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="12">on the open theatre of the world, and is the great &s;ource of revolutions and public convul&s;ions. The hi&s;torian, therefore, has &s;carce occa&s;ion to mention any other kind of religion; and he may retain the highe&s;t regard for true piety, even while he expo&s;es all the abu&s;es of the fal&s;e. He may even think, that he cannot better &s;how his at|tachment to the former than by detecting the latter, and laying open its ab&s;urdities and pernicious tendency.</P>
<P>It is no proof of irreligion in an hi&s;torian, that he remarks &s;ome fault or imperfection in each &s;ect of religion, which he has occa&s;ion to mention. Every in&s;titution, however di|vine, which is adopted by men, mu&s;t partake of the weakne&s;s and infirmities of our nature; and will be apt, unle&s;s carefully guarded, to degenerate into one extreme or the other. What &s;pecies of devotion &s;o pure, noble, and worthy the Supreme Being, as that which is mo&s;t &s;piritual, &s;imple, unadorned, and which partakes nothing either of the &s;en&s;es or ima|gination? Yet it is found by experience, that this mode of wor&s;hip does very naturally, among the vulgar, mount up into extrava|gance and fanatici&s;m. Even many of the fir&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="13">reformers are expo&s;ed to this reproach; and their zeal, though in the event it proved extremely u&s;eful, partook &s;trongly of the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic genius: Two of the judges in the reign of Charles the Second, &s;crupled not to advance this opinion even from the bench. Some mixture of ceremony, pomp, and orna|ment may &s;eem to correct the abu&s;e; yet will it be found very difficult to prevent &s;uch a form of religion from &s;inking &s;ometimes into &s;uper&s;tition. The church of England it&s;elf, which is perhaps the be&s;t medium among the&s;e extremes, will be allowed, at lea&s;t during the age of archbi&s;hop Laud, to have been &s;ome|what infected with a &s;uper&s;tition, re&s;embling the Popi&s;h; and to have payed a higher re|gard to &s;ome po&s;itive in&s;titutions, than the nature of the things, &s;trictly &s;peaking, would permit. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an hi&s;torian to remark the&s;e abu&s;es of all kinds; but it be|longs al&s;o to a prudent reader to confine the repre&s;entations, which he meets with, to that age alone of which the author treats. What ab&s;urdity, for in&s;tance, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Pre&s;byterians, Independants, Anabapti&s;ts, and other &s;ectaries of the pre&s;ent age partake of all the extravagancies, which we remark in tho&s;e, who bore the&s;e appellations in the
<PB N="9" REF="14">la&s;t century? The inference indeed &s;eems ju&s;ter; where &s;ects have been noted for fanatici&s;m during one period, to conclude, that they will be very moderate and rea&s;on|able in the &s;ub&s;equent. For as the nature of fanatici&s;m during one period, is to aboli&s;h all &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to prie&s;tly power, it follows, that as &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;erment is abated, men are naturally, in &s;uch &s;ects, left to the free u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and &s;hake off the fetters of cu&s;tom and authority.</P></Q>
<P>To &s;ay barely, that Mr. Hume in his moral character was unexceptionable, would be doing him inju&s;tice; he was truly amiable, gentle, ho&s;pitable, and humane. His temper was ca&s;t in the happie&s;t mould, if we may not except to his anxious and extreme &s;en&s;ibility, in every thing which affected his literary reputation. It is told, that an elderly woman in the &s;uburbs of Edinburgh, who&s;e exce&s;s of zeal was pro|portionable to her want of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion, called on Mr. Hume; declaimed violently again&s;t his &s;ceptical principles, as &s;he had
<PB N="10" REF="15">learned them by report; repre&s;ented, that he was nodding on the brink of everla&s;ting de|&s;truction; and delivered an earne&s;t prayer, that it would plea&s;e divine grace to give him to <HI>&s;ee</HI> the error of his ways. Mr. Hume li&s;tened to her with attention and good humour, thanked the lady for her concern about his future wel|fare, and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to know what was her line in life. She informed him, that &s;he was a married woman, and that her hu&s;band was a tallow-chandler in the neighbourhood; upon which Mr. Hume replied, <Q>Good wo|man, &s;ince you have expre&s;&s;ed &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire that I &s;hould be in&s;pired with <HI>inward light,</HI> I beg you will &s;upply me with <HI>out|ward light</HI> al&s;o.</Q> The matron retired, not a little &s;atisfied with the commi&s;&s;ion which he gave her, and her hu&s;band thenceforwards &s;up|plied Mr. Hume's family with candles.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the ideas which zealots may have formed of Mr. Hume's principles, as latitudinarian, as athei&s;tical, as damnable: his brother's notions of them were very different. For, &s;peaking of the Hi&s;torian one day, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner, <Q>My bro|ther Davie is a good enough &s;ort of a man, <HI>but rather narrow minded.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">As to Mr. Hume's abilities as a Philo&s;o|pher, and an Hi&s;torian, his Works are the ba&s;is on which po&s;terity will rear his everla&s;t|ing fame.</P>
<P>A few months before his death, Mr. Hume was per&s;uaded by his friends to try the effects of a long journey, and the Bath waters: but finding his malady to increa&s;e, he re&s;igned all hopes of life. He main|tained, however, his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s; and being re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of the &s;hort remainder of his lea&s;e, he wrote to his friends in Edinburgh, informing them of his re&s;olution to be in that city by a cer|tain day, which he named; and &s;eparate|ly reque&s;ted their company to dinner on the day following. Accordingly, Lord Elibank, Profe&s;&s;or Fergu&s;on, Mr. Home the Dramatic Poet, Dr. Smith, Dr. Blair, Dr. Black, and others of his literary friends, obeyed the &s;ummons, and took a &s;ort of farewel dinner with their dying friend. His <HI>flowery</HI> rival in hi&s;toric fame was al&s;o invited. But, alas! the Lord Advocate of Scotland invites this <HI>Reverend Doctor</HI> on that very day to a turtle fea&s;t. What was to be done? both invitations could not be embraced;&mdash;the con|te&s;t was &s;hort: For as it would &s;eem, this
<PB N="12" REF="17">Hi&s;torian's ta&s;te is almo&s;t as elegant in eating, as in writing, he judiciou&s;ly preferred the <HI>turtle</HI> of my Lord Advocate to the <HI>mutton</HI> of David Hume.</P>
<P>Never did death make more regular and vi&s;ible approaches than to Mr. Hume. He met the&s;e with a chearfulne&s;s and re&s;ignation, which could only be the re&s;ult of a vigorous under&s;tanding, and a well-&s;pent life. He &s;till went abroad, called upon his friends, but as the fatigue of a chai&s;e was now become in|tolerable, he went in a &s;edan chair, and his gha&s;tly looks bore the mo&s;t &s;triking appear|ances of &s;peedy death. His &s;ituation was the more uncomfortable, that in his weak ema|ciated &s;tate, the phy&s;icians pre&s;cribed to him in&s;tead of a down bed, to lie on a rugged pallet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His di&s;ea&s;e was a diarrheea; the phy&s;icians were divided about the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the malady. There is rea&s;on however to con|jecture, that his di&s;order originated from a cour&s;e of eating ra|ther fully, without drinking in proportion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He had already &s;ettled his affairs, and his facetiou&s;ne&s;s &s;till &s;ugge&s;ted to him to make &s;ome verbal legacies, which would not have been &s;o &s;uitable to the gravity of a &s;olemn deed. His friend Mr. Home the Poet, af|fected
<PB N="13" REF="18">a delicacy which abhorred even the ta&s;te of Port wine; this whim&s;ical nicety had often been the &s;ubject of Mr. Hume's rail|lery, and he left verbally to his friend the poet, <HI>one bottle</HI> of Port, and ten dozen of Claret, but on this condition, that the poet &s;hould drink the Port at two &s;ittings, before he ta&s;ted the Claret.</P>
<P>Such was the e&s;timation in which Mr. Hume was held, from his amiable qualities as a citizen, as well as from his literary fame, that for &s;ome weeks before his death, his &s;ituation became the univer&s;al topick of con|ver&s;ation and enquiry; each individual ex|pre&s;&s;ing an anxious &s;olicitude about his health, as if he had been his intimate and particular friend.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth of Augu&s;t, Mr. Hume's character was put beyond the reach of being &s;ullied by human frailty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hume, after his circum&s;tances became affluent, lived very ho&s;pitably and genteely. Yet he left to his relations up|wards of 10,000l. of his own acquiring. He had a pen&s;ion from government of 500l. per annum.</NOTE>. As &s;oon as he conceived him&s;elf to be in a dying way, he purcha&s;ed a &s;pot for the depo&s;iting of his
<PB N="14" REF="19">a&s;hes; the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the Ca&s;ton burying-ground at Edinburgh, <HI>a rock wherein never man had been laid.</HI> And from the par|ticular charge he gave about his corp&s;e, it would &s;eem he was not altogether devoid of apprehen&s;ions of its being treated with in|&s;ult.</P>
<P>The anxious attention with which the public viewed every circum&s;tance re&s;pecting Mr. Hume's illne&s;s was not terminated even by his death. From the bu&s;y curio&s;ity of the mob, one would have pre&s;umed them to entertain notions that the a&s;hes of Mr. Hume were to have been the cau&s;e or the object of miraculous exertion. As the phy&s;icians of London and Edinburgh were divided about the &s;eat of his di&s;order, tho&s;e of the city where he died, propo&s;ed that his body &s;hould be opened: but this, his brother, who was al&s;o his executor, agreeably to the orders of the decea&s;ed, would not permit.</P>
<P>It is hardly to be credited, that the grave|diggers, digging with pick-axes Mr. Hume's grave, &s;hould have attracted the gaping curio|&s;ity of the multitude. That, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="15" REF="20">a heavy rain, which fell during the in|terment, multitudes of all ranks gazed at the funeral proce&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the mob were a&s;&s;embled round Mr. Hume's door to &s;ee the corp&s;e taken out to interment, the following &s;hort dia|logue pa&s;&s;ed between two of the refu&s;e of the rabble: <Q>Ah, (&s;ays one) he was an Athei&s;t.</Q> <Q>No matter, (&s;ays another) he was an <HI>hone&s;t man.</HI></Q></NOTE>, as if they had expected the hear&s;e to have been con&s;umed in livid flames, or encircled with a ray of glory; that people in a &s;phere much above the rab|ble would have &s;ent to the &s;exton for the keys of the burying-ground, and paid him to have acce&s;s to vi&s;it the grave. And that on a Sunday evening (the gates of the bury|ing-ground being opened for another funeral) the company, from a public walk in the neighbourhood, flocked in &s;uch crouds to Mr. Hume's grave, that his brother actually became apprehen&s;ive upon the unu&s;ual con|cour&s;e, and ordered the grave to be railed in with all expedition.</P>
<P>After his interment, two tru&s;ty per&s;ons watched the grave for about eight nights. The watch was &s;et by eight at night; at which time a pi&s;tol was fired, and &s;o continued to be every hour till day-light. Candles in a

<PB N="29" REF="31">
<HEAD>SECTION II. On DEDICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE above particulars will have &s;hewn to readers, the <HI>man</HI> and the <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> as well as the highe&s;t re&s;pect that was paid to eminent <HI>virtue and abilities,</HI> even by tho&s;e in the lower cla&s;&s;es, who had differed &s;o widely from Mr. Hume in <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>political opi|nions,</HI> or who continued to <HI>reprobate</HI> his <HI>prin|ciples.</HI></P>
<P>But let us next proceed to the apology for the life and writings of our philo&s;opher, and &s;ee the rea&s;ons for his not having dedicated his works to any great men.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">To confe&s;s the truth, he wrote, generally, upon &s;ubjects of which the modern nobility are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;o contemptibly ig|norant, that to have in&s;cribed performances &s;o &s;cientific, to &s;uch patrons, would involve the Philo&s;opher in a &s;imilar error of judg|ment. Indeed, nothing is more offen&s;ive to men of true ta&s;te, and right feeling, than the <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of per&s;ons of genius, to per&s;ons of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, merely as &s;uch. This it is, more than any thing el&s;e, that hath helped to degrade the literary character; which, as it implies a &s;uperior vigour of intellect, and a more enlarged capacity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, naturally, an unrivalled dignity. According to all the &s;y&s;tems of all the &s;ects, it is allowed that the human under&s;tanding is the greate&s;t, as it is the mo&s;t boa&s;ted, di&s;tinction of <HI>human beings;</HI> con&s;equently, one of the&s;e beings mu&s;t ri&s;e higher than another in the &s;cale of rationality, only by &s;o much, as the di&s;tingui&s;hing part of him is elevated above that of others: So, like|wi&s;e, a &s;hallow, illiterate, and vacant creature, mu&s;t &s;ink in the &s;cale, by the &s;ame equitable proportion. Now, it is ea&s;y to prove, that, what are called the Great (who are but too com|monly the lea&s;t of all God's little atoms), mu&s;t, according to the very nature of things, be among&s;t the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> judges of literary merit,
<PB N="31" REF="33">and therefore, &s;peaking truly, its mo&s;t im|proper patrons. Men, born to titles and to fortunes which de&s;cend without effort, or ex|ertion of any talent whatever, imagine the cul|tivation of the mind totally adventitious: nor does the man of fa&s;hion admit it into the catalogue of his accompli&s;hments. Even the harlequin Lord Che&s;terfield&mdash;that &s;ucce&s;sful &s;matterer&mdash;allows only &s;uch a &s;hare of phi|lo&s;ophy, as belongs to the philo&s;ophy of the pa&s;&s;ions; which is nothing more in his idea, than guarding <HI>your&s;elf</HI> while you make a fine, dextrous, and &s;ucce&s;sful pu&s;h at the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>another.</HI> Giddine&s;s, glitter, the indolence of plenty, and above all, its impudence, all contribute to render per&s;ons of rank, frivolous, voluble, &s;uperficial; the illu&s;trious excep|tions of a Bacon, a Bolingbroke, a Shafte&s;|bury, a Lyttleton, a Pru&s;&s;ia, a Clarendon, have nothing to do with a rule &s;o deplorably general.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, can any thing be &s;o prepo&s;terous, as to in&s;cribe to the mere tin|&s;el of titles, the labours of learning, or the reflections of accurate and ab&s;tru&s;e Philo|&s;ophy? Yet hath this been, for many ages, the practice. Whence hath it happened?
<PB N="32" REF="34">The que&s;tion cannot be an&s;wered without affecting us.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eems to have neglected tho&s;e, whom Nature hath mo&s;t favoured; and <HI>men of genius,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, think it but fair, to &s;upply the defect by &s;oliciting <HI>men of money.</HI> This &s;olicitation, however, &s;ubjects them to all that rudene&s;s and di&s;dain, which tho&s;e who have only a handful of authority, be|&s;tow upon their flatterers. The flatterers are, in turn, well &s;erved; they &s;et out upon a wrong principle.&mdash;The intercour&s;e is alto|gether ill managed. Dedications, being an|other &s;ource of our <HI>national Hypocri&s;y,</HI> de|&s;erve a more correct inve&s;tigation. It has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved, that they are fundamen|tally fal&s;e.</P>
<P>A dedication admits of two di&s;tinct defini|tions, of which, one belongs to the Patron, and one to the Author. The Patron not only receives every untruth that can be ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the pride of Panegyric, as his due, but believes, at the &s;ame time, that he re|ceives it from an unprovided being, who is to exi&s;t for a certain &s;pace of time upon the &s;ucce&s;s of his encomium. Something there|fore is u&s;ually &s;ent to keep&mdash;(for I would
<PB N="33" REF="35">adopt the great man's language&mdash;"the poor devil of an Author from &s;tarving:" The Au|thor's definition, is, on the other hand, &s;o &s;ervile, as to deduct from every &s;entiment of pity, and make us confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of his di&s;grace.&mdash;He is contented to lavi&s;h prai&s;es, of which the be&s;t man on earth, might blu&s;h to be the object, and he expects a golden reward, proportionate to the violent colour|ings of the varni&s;h, and to the fainter, or fuller blaze of the "lye courteous." Which conduct &s;hall we mo&s;t reprobate? They are equally contemptible. The traffic &s;hould be regulated more con&s;i&s;tently. If men of genius mu&s;t needs addre&s;s their works to men of rank, let them a&s;&s;ert a more noble equality. If they draw the portraits of any per&s;on re|markable for any thing, let not a writer think, he is more honoured, than he honours; if he emblazons a name, which was before, glim|mering in ob&s;curity, the obligation is, to all intents and purpo&s;es, on the &s;ide of the Patron; who, but for &s;uch imputed excel|lence, would have pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved through life: if he faithfully di&s;plays a character al|ready much celebrated, he is &s;till a benefac|tor to that character, if it were only for jog|ging the elbow of the public, which, but for
<PB N="34" REF="36">&s;uch occa&s;ional mementos would &s;oon forget the be&s;t and brighte&s;t man in the world.</P>
<P>Seriou&s;ly, were literary per&s;ons to act upon &s;ome &s;uch principle as this, and &s;hew their Patrons, that the dealing, was, in point both of prai&s;e and profit, entirely on the &s;quare, it would check much of that a&s;&s;urance which is now indulged, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that writers are to offer incen&s;e at the &s;hrine of greatne&s;s; or,&mdash;in words more worthy &s;o grovling a &s;ub|ject, to making the faggot blaze to gratify folly, and then to be paid for burning the fingers, as the pittance is di&s;pen&s;ed by a ta&s;k|ma&s;ter. Of much more &s;ervice, indeed, would it be to genius, &s;cience, and general learn|ing, if their votaries were more inclined to cheri&s;h a &s;pirit of intellectual independency&mdash; if, in&s;tead of cringing to a courtier, or run|ning, from the mo&s;t fordid motives, into panegyrical hyperbole, they were to a&s;&s;ert their dignity, and &s;hew the &s;uperior lu&s;tre of ta|lents to the dullne&s;s of titles, I &s;ay, if a &s;pirit of this kind were arou&s;ed, it would &s;oon re&s;tore to men of genius, the original rights of literature, at the &s;ame time that it would effectually cru&s;h that daring in&s;olence, which is now common among a &s;et of people, who
<PB N="35" REF="37">pique them&s;elves upon advantages which, were the proper levelling power maintained, would of it&s;elf, by no means entitle them to equal honours.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of this &s;pirited conduct, however, we have the misfortune to perceive a &s;tyle of ba&s;ene&s;s and adulation, creep through mo&s;t of the epi&s;tles dedicatory for the &s;pace of &s;everal centuries; by which means flattery and ful&s;omene&s;s is a&s;&s;ociated with the very idea of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, and the literary character is held, by the dulle&s;t of the &s;pecies, in utter contempt.</P>
<P>What hath, undoubtedly, contributed to bring about &s;o di&s;graceful a circum&s;tance, is a cu&s;tom which prevails among&s;t authors, of &s;welling the ignorant vanity of Patrons, by &s;ubmitting to them a performance prior to its entry into the public world: this mode, might, indeed, be rea&s;onable enough, were it only de&s;igned as a compliment to the ta&s;te of the Patron, which the Authors may be &s;uppo&s;ed anxious to gratify, before the matter becomes, as it were, public proper|ty; but when it is done with a view of begging permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ay civil things of the Patron and his family, it degenerates
<PB N="36" REF="38">into a meanne&s;s which ju&s;tly merits the neg|lect that commonly attends it.</P>
<P>A&s;k permi&s;&s;ion! for what? For di&s;tin|gui&s;hing a man? For circulating the know|ledge of his good qualities beyond the nar|row circle of very likely, a frivilous &s;et of companions! Require <HI>leave</HI> to do this! &mdash;Was there ever heard &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;t|ency?&mdash;The point is mi&s;conceived. Be it again remarked, that, in true &s;cience there is a greatne&s;s which can &s;eldom <HI>receive,</HI> though it may often, <HI>confer</HI> obligations. Genius may more properly be &s;aid to patronize, than be patronized.</P>
<P>If a production is fit for the eye of men of ta&s;te, it ought to be acceptable to men of rank; who are ready enough to be thought in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fine ta&s;te them|&s;elves, and very frequently, no doubt, pay liberally, for their dedications, &s;olely upon that principle.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, a performance is crude, trifling, ill-written, and notwith&s;tand|ing &s;uch defects, is, without the con&s;ent of the Patron, adorned with a name which it di&s;graces, &s;uch Patron ought publicly to re|nounce
<PB N="37" REF="39">his protection, and treat the pre|tender, as every pretender of whatever pro|fe&s;&s;ion de&s;erves to be treated; &s;till, however, with this &s;alvo, that if the production could have done any &s;ervice to literature, or pro|moted, but in a &s;mall degree, the cau&s;e of &s;cience, he would have been the fir&s;t man to acknowledge <HI>his obligations,</HI> for having been thought a fit patron to a&s;&s;i&s;t that cau&s;e, and &s;trengthen tho&s;e &s;ervices.&mdash;While the pre|&s;ent &s;candalous conce&s;&s;ions remain, the &s;neer will inevitably be thrown upon &s;uch abomin|able pro&s;tration. I have been &s;omewhat co|pious on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e it has never, to my recollection, been placed in a proper light.</P>
<P>Perhaps, this doctrine of dedications, may be little reli&s;hed by tho&s;e who are daily pam|pered into conceit by daily panegyric, but it is a ju&s;tice which every man of letters owes to a character, founded on qualities, which ought to be a better pa&s;&s;port to ho|norary di&s;tinctions, than any that can be con|ferred by royal grant, or by the pride of ance&s;try.</P>
<P>On &s;uch qualities was &s;ounded the reputa|tion of David Hume, &s;o that upon <HI>this</HI> oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="38" REF="40">at lea&s;t, his example may be held up to the per&s;ons engaged in literary pur&s;uits, as a proper &s;tandard.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem from the&s;e ingenious remarks, on dedicators, that authors &s;hould maintain dignity of character, and not pro&s;titute them|&s;elves by addre&s;&s;ing either folly or &s;tupidity in high &s;tations; but if they dedicate at all, to addre&s;s the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good only.</HI> This would undoubtedly greatly le&s;&s;en the number of dedications, and <HI>Dedicatees</HI> might be held up to view from the middling, or lower ranks, which would exhibit new <HI>phoenomena</HI> in the literary region. But alas! this, tho' a debt due to &s;uperior merit, is not to be expect|ed, for there would &s;eldom be <HI>patronage,</HI> or emoluments in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Certainly, in this in&s;inuating kind of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, all <HI>daubing, flattery,</HI> or <HI>bomba&s;t,</HI> &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, as what may be termed, <HI>"coar&s;e, plai&s;tering work,"</HI> has brought addre&s;&s;es of this &s;ort into contempt. A <HI>production</HI> of <HI>genius</HI> requires not patronage, <HI>That,</HI> marked by the <HI>unintere&s;ting,</HI> the <HI>dull,</HI> or <HI>in&s;ipid,</HI> will not be pu&s;hed into public e&s;teem by any <HI>patron,</HI> or <HI>dedication</HI> what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">The names of &s;everal &s;en&s;ible, and even eminent writers, have not a little been di&s;|graced by <HI>ful&s;ome dedications.</HI> Dryden, Colley Cibber, Mrs. Centlivre, Lee, Otway, and others, witne&s;s to the truth of this; as do &s;ome of our modern mi&s;cellanies, novels, plays, adventures, &amp;c.; not forgetting the author of <HI>liberal opinions.</HI> But it is hoped, that with the increa&s;e of &s;cience, a general reform in this abu&s;e, will take place. <HI>Literary para&s;ites,</HI> in an <HI>age</HI> of <HI>light</HI> and <HI>knowledge, &s;hould neither be &s;een, felt, heard, or under&s;tood.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. A PARALLEL betwixt DAVID HUME and LORD CHESTERFIELD, both with re|&s;pect to <HI>Abilities</HI> and <HI>Principles.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET me now, &s;ays the author of the Apo|logy, &amp;c. draw a &s;light parallel betwixt this gentleman, and another celebrated writer, who de&s;cended into the tomb a little before him. I would per&s;uade the reader to compare with me the &s;y&s;tem of David Hume, and that of the late Earl of Che&s;terfield. Not with a view of propo&s;ing the former to his imitation&mdash;for that point &s;hould always be &s;ettled by a man's own mind, after a great deal of premedita|tion upon the matter&mdash;but, as it may &s;erve to &s;hew, what hath, indeed, been a principal endeavour in the&s;e pages, that it is po&s;&s;ible even for &s;ceptics, to be more worthy mem|bers
<PB N="44" REF="44">of &s;ociety, more reverend to a fir&s;t cau&s;e, whatever it may be, and more e&s;&s;entially the friend of mankind, than the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;ons who have never ventured &s;o far into the rece&s;&s;es of enquiry. Lord Che&s;terfield was a character more di&s;tingui&s;hed for the brillian|cy of his wit, than the &s;olider powers of his under&s;tanding.&mdash;In points of philo&s;ophy, he was exceedingly &s;uperficial, in politics he did not want &s;agacity or experience. A&s;&s;i&s;ted, however, very much, by the &s;plendours of his title&mdash;for a little &s;park will make a large lu&s;tre in a Lord&mdash;he &s;u&s;tained his character with &s;ingular eclat, and pa&s;&s;ed in the world (which is very ea&s;ily dazzled) as a compound of elegance, humour, <HI>morality,</HI> gaiety, and patronage.&mdash;The&s;e qualities, in a certain de|gree, we allow him to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, except one: it certainly is not now nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve that it is the word <HI>morality</HI> which mu&s;t be &s;cratched out of this li&s;t. For many years, however, Lord Che&s;terfield's <HI>morals</HI> were un|&s;u&s;pected; at length, too &s;uperficial to be con|&s;i&s;tent, or perhaps, weary of deceiving the world into notions of his plain dealing, he conde&s;cended, in the eve of life, to &s;hew man|kind what a bubble he had mad of it; how long, and how &s;ucce&s;sful he had &s;ported upon its weakne&s;&s;es&mdash;with how much ea&s;e he had
<PB N="45" REF="45">played the elegant trifler, and by what modes and manoeuvres, he had, with a facility which required no effort but a &s;mooth face, and pli|able features, led, in victorious chains, a thou|&s;and fools to the altars either of ridicule, or de|bauchery, or de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Such were the principles; &s;uch is the &s;y&s;tem of this <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed hypocrite,</HI> by the adoption of who&s;e precepts, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible either for youth or age, with or wi&s;dom, to e&s;cape every thing that is execrable, contemptible, and delu&s;ive. The athei&s;tical Hume, as &s;ome have called him, was, in compari&s;on with Che&s;|terfield, de&s;erving of every epithet that could be formed in language to expre&s;s virtue. In his life, writing, and at his death, he &s;eems to have abhorred <HI>di&s;&s;imulation;</HI> and yet, his com|pany "was not unacceptible to the young and carele&s;s, as well as to the &s;tudious, and lite|rary;" nor had he "any rea&s;on to complain of the reception he met from <HI>mode&s;t</HI> women, in who&s;e company he was particularly de|lighted." He did not, neverthele&s;s, profe&s;s a fondne&s;s for the &s;ociety of <HI>mode&s;t</HI> women, becau&s;e it was <HI>&s;afer</HI> to have an affair of gal|lantry with &s;uch, than with a pro&s;titute pro|fe&s;&s;ed; or becau&s;e the connection was more elevated and con&s;i&s;tent with the amours of a
<PB N="46" REF="46">gentleman; nor did he mix with the gay, and carele&s;s, with any latent de&s;ign to take an ad|vantage of the chearful hour, in order to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;ecrets of the heart, im|parted in its fullne&s;s&mdash;and con&s;equently ma&s;ter of the per&s;on to whom that entrapped heart had the misfortune to belong. By no means.&mdash; Whatever objections may lie again&s;t the phi|lo&s;ophy of Hume; none of them are of this nature; &s;ince his mo&s;t ab&s;tract re&s;earches were in favour of a behaviour perfectly irreproach|able.</P>
<P>Whoever is acquainted with Mr. Hume's writings, will bear witne&s;s, that he was a lover of decency, order and decorum. Whoever knew the man, can atte&s;t, that, the following pa&s;&s;ages are no wi&s;e exaggerated.</P>
<P>"I <HI>am,</HI>" &s;ays he, "or rather <HI>was,</HI> (for that is the &s;tyle I mu&s;t now u&s;e in &s;peaking of my&s;elf, which emboldens me the more to &s;peak my &s;entiments); I was, I &s;ay, a man of mild di&s;po&s;itions, of command of temper, of an open, &s;ocial, and cheerful humour, ca|pable of attachment, but little &s;u&s;ceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my pa&s;&s;ions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling pa&s;&s;ion, never &s;oured my temper, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="47" REF="47">my frequent di&s;appointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and carele&s;s, as well as to the &s;tudious and li|terary; and as I took a particular plea&s;ure in the company of mode&s;t women, I had no rea|&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though mo&s;t men any wi&s;e eminent, have found rea&s;on to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they &s;eemed to be di&s;armed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occa&s;ion to vindicate any one circum&s;tance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, would have been glad to invent and propa|gate any &s;tory to my di&s;advantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot &s;ay there is no vanity in making this funeral ora|tion of my&s;elf, but I hope it is not a mi&s;|placed one; and this is a matter of fact which is ea&s;ily cleared and a&s;certained."</P>
<P>To a character &s;o amiable, &s;o complacent, and &s;o little tinctured by that pedantry which always &s;ticks to an affected philo&s;opher, <HI>who,</HI> that hath any &s;en&s;e of agreeable qualities, will
<PB N="48" REF="48">ever bring near him &s;uch a frivolous compound of whim, wickedne&s;s, cunning, and congee, as Lord Che&s;terfield; unle&s;s, indeed, he is brought forward by way of contra&s;t. There appears likewi&s;e to me, to have been as wide a difference in the &s;ize of their abilities, as there was in the hone&s;ty of their, principles: every page in tho&s;e Letters, which have laid open his Lord&s;hip's hypocri&s;y, furni&s;hes us with examples of his futility: it would be the drudgery of a day to detect a &s;ingle light &s;en|tence in Hume. The Earl of Che&s;terfield's utmo&s;t &s;tretch of penetration, amounts to little more than &s;hrewdne&s;s, partly caught from the &s;ugge&s;tions of a mind naturally &s;u&s;picious, and partly from ob&s;ervations upon the weak|ne&s;&s;es, and tender imperfections of men le&s;s capable to di&s;&s;emble. This faculty, is at be&s;t, but a principal ingredient in the character of a <HI>cunning</HI> fellow, who, as it were, by impercepti|ble &s;light of hand, hath the art of appearing what he is not; and of cheating you, with &s;in|gular dexterity, even before your face.</P>
<P>But all the fame, or popular etiquette that could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from &s;uch practices, Hume would have di&s;carded with di&s;dain, And, chiefly, for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, his genius had not a &s;ingle grain of the petit maitre in it,
<PB N="49" REF="49">which, by the way, was a con&s;iderable ingre|dient in Lord Che&s;terfield's; and, &s;econdly, he had too much dignity in his nature, and too ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ocial compact between the individual, and the whole human race, to find any ze&s;t in gratifications, which emanated from neither more nor le&s;s flagrant treachery. Hence it appears obvious enough, that the Earl of Che&s;terfield's heart and head were both unable to bear any &s;ort of parallel with the head and heart of David Hume. The one is the Au|thor of a &s;y&s;tem which &s;eems to have been pillaged from the Dancing-ma&s;ter, the Per|fumer, and the Devil: the other pur&s;ues a philo&s;ophy, which, with all its exceptions, gives countenance neither to the follies of a coxcomb, nor the meanne&s;s and mi&s;chief of a hypocrite&mdash;a wretch, which, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e pages hath been marked with &s;in|gular reprobation; and above all other hypo|crites, one that, in a kind of moral ma&s;querade dre&s;s, perpetrates every ba&s;ene&s;s, and pa&s;&s;es upon the world as a <HI>mighty good Chri&s;tian creature.</HI></P>

<P>THE public will judge of the <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>impartiality</HI> of the foregoing compari|&s;on. Lord Che&s;terfield never pretended to be a moral philo&s;opher; how far, then, compar|ing men of &s;uch oppo&s;ite principles, ta&s;tes, and tempers was proper, is left to the &s;en&s;ible reader. But as unfavourable ideas of our <HI>noble author,</HI> may be formed from the above, as well as from &s;ome late &s;trictures, on what is termed "the loo&s;e part of his letters to his &s;on," I cannot in ju&s;tice to his character, but give the following ju&s;t ob&s;ervation made upon it.</P>
<P>The <HI>mental abilities</HI> of Lord Che&s;terfield have never been brought into que&s;tion, for
<PB N="52" REF="51">all have allowed the keenne&s;s of his wit, and the &s;oundne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, but many on the evidence of a &s;ingle fact have con|demned his principles, as unfavourable to the true intere&s;ts of religion, honour, and vir|tue: His morals have been excerated, purely on the ground of accu&s;ation afforded by &s;ome of tho&s;e private letters to Mr. Stanhope, which ought not to have been made public. Had the&s;e never &s;een the light, his Lord&s;hip's &s;ame had, perhaps, never &s;uffered any impeach|ment, and his memory might have been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, with that applau&s;e and admiration, which we &s;ee paid to the Mon|tagues, the Boyles, the Sackvilles, the Shef|fields, and the Granvill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, who now repo&s;e on their laurels, unmole&s;ted by the fangs of envy, or the &s;hafts of the cen&s;orious.</P>
<P>In public &s;tations, (particularly in Ireland) Lord Che&s;terfield's conduct ever met with de|&s;erved plau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts; in private life, his brilliant wit, his exqui&s;ite humour, and his invariable p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tene&s;s, rendered him the con&s;tant delight of his friends;&mdash;and in the tender dome&s;tic re|lations, he was not only irreproachable, but exemplary. In fine, a more amiable man
<PB N="53" REF="52">&s;carce ever graced a court, or adorned the peaceful &s;cenes of retirement.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to that exceptionable part of his conduct,&mdash;his failure as a preceptor, lit|tle can be &s;aid in his defence, but let that little be heard.</P>
<P>A father &s;o de&s;irous that his &s;on &s;hould an&s;wer in every re&s;pect, the model of per|fection he had &s;ketched out to him&s;elf, mu&s;t have been much mortified, on finding him&s;elf fru&s;trated in his unwearied endeavours to po|li&s;h and refine his manners.&mdash;The fertility of his genius in expedients to in&s;pire Mr. Stan|hope with the <HI>de&s;ire of plea&s;ing,</HI> is not any where more con&s;picuous than in this part of his letters. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We allude to tho&s;e written when the young gentleman was arrived at the age of nineteen; a time of life when the utmo&s;t ex|ertions of good breeding would be expected.</NOTE> Finding the di&s;order ob|&s;tinate, he had recour&s;e to more de&s;perate remedies; as <HI>empirics</HI> too frequently admi|ni&s;ter poi&s;on in their vain attempts to &s;ub|due unconquerable maladies, or to cure di&s;|ea&s;es le&s;s dangerous, than tho&s;e which their incon&s;iderate practice entails upon their pa|tients.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">Far be it from me to endeavour to con|ceal, or excu&s;e the luxuriances of a warm imagination. Vice can at no time, and under no pretence, become any part of a rational education; nor would it be &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay, that the manners of great cities, e&s;pecially Paris, have in &s;ome de|gree <HI>authorized polite gallantry.</HI> In vain al&s;o would it be urged, that Lord Che&s;ter|field, knowing, perhaps, by his own expe|rience, with how much difficulty certain pa&s;&s;ions are re&s;i&s;ted in youth, might have thought there was no other choice but that of <HI>coar&s;e debauchery,</HI> and &s;entimental engage|ments, or that the latter depending, &s;ome|times, on a fine addre&s;s, (or being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the graces) might &s;timulate his pupil to excel this way.</P>
<P>It might further be &s;aid, that when mu|tual liberty is allowed, in what is called in Paris, the married &s;tate, cha&s;tity can no more be expected on one &s;ide, than fidelity on the other; nor can the crime of corruption well be charged where general depravity pre|vails.</P>
<P>But we re&s;t not the defence of Lord Che&s;|terfield on &s;uch weak foundations: Drawing a
<PB N="55" REF="54">veil, therefore, on this part of his conduct, which was not intended, and ought not to have been expo&s;ed to the public eye, we mu&s;t be content with deploring the weakne&s;s of hu|man nature, which hitherto never admitted of perfection.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. A <HI>Portrait</HI> of <HI>Lord Che&s;terfield.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS character is generally well under|&s;tood&mdash;It is agreed on all hands, that he was a di&s;creet Clodius;&mdash;a &s;ober Duke of Whar|ton, &mdash;born with inferiour abilities to tho&s;e which di&s;tingui&s;h that unfortunate nobleman, but with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion for univer&s;al admira|tion, he was ma&s;ter of more prudence and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>He formed him&s;elf very early to make a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the &s;tate. Impelled by his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, he applied him&s;elf a&s;&s;i|duou&s;ly to &s;tudies which might render him an accompli&s;hed &s;peaker, an <HI>able</HI> negotiator,
<PB N="58" REF="56">a coun&s;ellor in the cabinet;&mdash;to &s;um up all, one equal to any civil employment. There cannot be a doubt that he aimed at acquir|ing the office of prime mini&s;ter; or at lea&s;t the power of appointing the per&s;on whom he approved to that po&s;t.&mdash;But the &s;uperiour abilities of Walpole di&s;appointed his ambi|tion.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation was flattering:&mdash;When young he was placed about the per&s;on of <HI>George the Second,</HI> when prince of Wales; he did not reflect that tho&s;e who are in the mo&s;t elevated &s;tation have no idea of friend&s;hip independent of a mo&s;t implicit, not to &s;ay abject re&s;ignation to their will. His mar|riage with the Duche&s;s of Kendal's neice, &s;o far from advancing his intere&s;t at court, oc|ca&s;ioned a litigation between him and his &s;o|vereign.</P>
<P>He under&s;tood what is called the balance of Europe, or the &s;everal intere&s;ts and claims of its princes, perfectly. This &s;cience, with his poli&s;hed addre&s;s, qualified him to be one of the able&s;t negociators of his time. He made him&s;elf acquainted with the characters of all the great men in the &s;everal courts of Europe; he knew their intrigues,&mdash;their at|tachments,
<PB N="59" REF="57">their foibles; and was enabled from thence to counteract all their political machinations.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that his being &s;ent on his fir&s;t emba&s;&s;y to Holland, was rather an ho|nourable exile, than a mark of favour: He would, in all probability have been trouble|&s;ome at home&mdash;<HI>Walpole</HI> did not envy him the honour of &s;hining among the Dutch, and eclip&s;ing a French envoy by &s;uperior adroit|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As a &s;peaker, he is ju&s;tly celebrated for a certain accuracy, as well as brilliancy of &s;tyle; for pointed wit, gay humour, and &s;portive facetiou&s;ne&s;s. However, his admirers mu&s;t confe&s;s, that he never could reach the &s;ub|lime in oratory.&mdash;He frequently &s;trove to di&s;arm his adver&s;aries by the mo&s;t profu&s;e commendation of their abilities; but what is certainly very reprehen&s;ible in him, while he be&s;towed unlimited commendations on the mini&s;ters whom he oppo&s;ed, he threw out the mo&s;t &s;tinging reflections on the prince, as if he had forgotten that the &s;ervants of the crown are alone accountable for errors in govern|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58">The mo&s;t applauded, as well as unexcep|tionable part of his public character, was his admini&s;tration in Ireland. As a Viceroy he &s;hone with great lu&s;tre, and was univer&s;ally approved; perhaps he was indebted to this &s;in|gular good fortune for his being called to the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, at the expiration of his fir&s;t year's government of that king|dom.</P>
<P>In private life, we &s;hould naturally pro|nounce a Che&s;terfield the mo&s;t &s;atisfied of all men: Ea&s;y, gay, polite, and ma&s;ter of his pa&s;&s;ions, what could &s;uch a man want to ren|der his happine&s;s complete? The &s;ame pa&s;|&s;ion for admiration which actuated him in public, accompanied him through every walk of life.</P>
<Q><L>Though wondering &s;enates hung on all he &s;poke;</L>
<L>The club mu&s;t hall him ma&s;ter of the joke.</L></Q>
<P>When he had reached one goal, he planned for another&mdash;He aimed at univer&s;ality of cha|racter: He wi&s;hed to be de&s;tined the patron of learned men, but wanted genero&s;ity of &s;oul to merit that title.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="59">He e&s;pou&s;ed and patronized a great ge|nius of the age, who addre&s;&s;ed an admi|rable <HI>plan</HI> of his <HI>Dictionary</HI> to him; but the capriciou&s;ne&s;s and in&s;tability of his mind, prevented his gaining that honour he mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed for,&mdash;a dedication of the work it&s;elf.&mdash;A Letter written to him on that memorable occa&s;ion by the author, who de|&s;pi&s;ed his meanne&s;s, and di&s;dained to gratify his vanity, will live for ever in the memory of tho&s;e who have been favoured with the recital of it.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile to any prin|ciples of <HI>rea&s;on and morality</HI> the &s;hocking advice which he gave his &s;on, viz. "to treat all women alike, and to &s;uppo&s;e them all equally liable to &s;eduction."&mdash;Was then his Lord&s;hip &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a lover?&mdash;Was his addre&s;s &s;o formidable, that no lady could re&s;i&s;t him?&mdash;His Lord&s;hip, I am afraid was not wholly free from affectation.&mdash;Great wits, and men who court applau&s;e from all the world, are not generally the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lovers.</P>
<P><HI>Prior</HI>'s Chloe was a poetical and ideal cha|racter, &mdash;<HI>Poor Pope</HI> was immoderately and o&s;|tentatiou&s;ly
<PB N="62" REF="60">fond of Patty Blount;&mdash;<HI>Swift</HI> after having admired and courted the celebrated Stella near twenty years, married her, and was afterwards never in her company but when a third per&s;on was pre&s;ent!</P>
<P>I would not in&s;inuate that his Lord&s;hip was &s;o cold a lover as Swift; nor do I imagine him to be the libertine he wi&s;hes to pa&s;s for.&mdash;Like Lord Foppington in the play, he might think the <HI>reputation</HI> of an <HI>amour</HI> with a fine woman, the mo&s;t delicious part of the bu&s;ine&s;s. I never heard of any of his Lord&s;hip's &s;ucce&s;sful gallantries, except that which brought Mr. Stanhope into the world. His contempt of the &s;ex might po&s;|&s;ibly arife, from their di&s;like and aver&s;ion to him.</P>
<P>Thus have I given the character drawn of Lord Che&s;terfield; in which are <HI>excellencies, beauties, defects</HI> and <HI>blemi&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>In Ireland they experienced (at a mo&s;t cri|tical conjuncture) his Lord&s;hip's <HI>wi&s;dom, mode|ration,</HI> and <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s,</HI> when in the pleni|tude of power.&mdash;That he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>great athilities,</HI> and <HI>eminent merit,</HI> in many re|&s;pects,
<PB N="63" REF="61">cannot be controverted&mdash;This ju&s;t re|mark, is a <HI>free will offering</HI> paid to <HI>departed worth,</HI> or an a&s;&s;emblage of amiable, agreeable qualities, joined to the mo&s;t &s;hining accom|pli&s;hments.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE above <HI>&s;elections,</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ional ob|&s;ervations,</HI> will, it is hoped, be favourably re|ceived. The editor has endeavoured to pre|&s;ent to the public, a plea&s;ing and profitable entertainment, in a &s;mall compa&s;s, con&s;ider|ing the variety, or number of important par|ticulars introduced. Whatever relates to &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed characters as Lord Che&s;terfield, and Mr. Hume, cannot but claim attention from per&s;ons of <HI>ta&s;te, and a laudable curio&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid by <HI>Hume's</HI> advo|cates, particularly, by the <HI>apologi&s;t</HI> for his life and writings, it were wrong not to remark on &s;ome &s;entiments that have been thrown out, with an <HI>air</HI> of <HI>triumph</HI> by that writer.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="63">He &s;ays, "perhaps it is one of the very wor&s;t circum&s;tances again&s;t the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> that very few of its profe&s;&s;ors were ever either &s;o moral, &s;o humane, or could &s;o phi|lo&s;ophically govern their pa&s;&s;ions, as the &s;cep|tical David Hume.</P>
<P>It is admitted that the lives of too many who think them&s;elves chri&s;tians, are vicious and immoral, a di&s;grace to their profe&s;&s;ion, a re|proach to humanity. I will al&s;o admit Mr. Hume to have had, a virtuous, philo&s;ophic mind.</P>
<P>But &s;urely chri&s;tianity ought not to be blamed for the profligacy of its profe&s;&s;ors. It were as unju&s;t to declaim again&s;t the <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>excellence</HI> of our <HI>civil con&s;titution,</HI> becau&s;e it hath been &s;o frequently <HI>violated</HI> by the <HI>venal,</HI> and the <HI>wicked.</HI> Chri&s;tianity gives not &s;helter to any &s;in; but on the contrary, hath &s;et the precepts and example of its divine founder again&s;t all iniquity,&mdash;as well as the pains of the world to come.&mdash;If its votaries are not <HI>pure, &s;elf-denied, meek, humble, pious</HI> and <HI>benevolent,</HI> it is not the fault of their religion; becau&s;e, for &s;ublimity of precepts and doctrines, un|adulterated chri&s;tianity will ever &s;tand unri|valled.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="64">But that very few of its profe&s;&s;ors, "were ever, either &s;o <HI>moral,</HI> &s;o <HI>humane,</HI> or could &s;o <HI>philo&s;ophically</HI> govern their pa&s;&s;ions as Mr. Hume," I deny.&mdash;Tho' <HI>clerical characters</HI> may, probably, appear mo&s;t exceptionable to the author of this unju&s;t remark, yet the very re&s;pectable names of <HI>Leighton, Barrow, Which|cot, Tillot&s;on, Cudworth, Burnet, Clarke, Hoad|ley, Butler, Middleton, Clayton, Berkley, Young, Sherlock, Secker&mdash;Fo&s;ter, Chandler, Duchal&mdash; Abernethly, Watts, Leland,</HI> and others that might be named, fully evince the contrary.&mdash; Several of the&s;e were remarkable for <HI>&s;elf go|vernment,</HI> for an <HI>equanimity</HI> of <HI>temper, effected</HI> by <HI>moral di&s;cipline;</HI> all of them were men of abilities, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by eminent virtue: &mdash;Nor is there one of them, who&s;e life was not as pure, and, perhaps, more <HI>u&s;eful</HI> than Mr. <HI>Hume</HI>'s.</P>

<P>The LATTER END of mo&s;t of the names above-mentioned, was &s;o peaceful, &s;o full of hope, &s;o nobly &s;upported by a <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to <HI>pa&s;t rectitude</HI> of life, and at the &s;ame time, marked by &s;uch &s;ublime &s;entiments;&mdash;that when we <HI>contra&s;t their la&s;t &s;cene,</HI> to Mr. Hume's not having an <HI>excu&s;e</HI> to give <HI>Charon,</HI> which in|deed &s;hewed much &s;erenity of mind) a great &s;uperiority appears. The entertainment de|rived from <HI>Lucian's Dialogues</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> was but cold and in&s;ipid at &s;uch an hour, compared to the elevated &s;trains of devotion which fell from tho&s;e who did honour to the chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>It were indelicate to &s;peak of living cha|racters, or numbers would &s;well the recital, as <HI>moral,</HI> and <HI>humane</HI> as Mr. Hume. But if we look back to the <HI>fir&s;t reformers,</HI> or days of <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> when <HI>truth</HI> &s;tood in need of &s;up|port from its votaries;&mdash;&s;hould we bring into this account tho&s;e chri&s;tian heroes and martyrs, who animated by virtuous re&s;olution, &s;uffered, and bled in the noble&s;t of all cau&s;es,&mdash;a glo|rious cloud of witne&s;&s;es in our favour would appear.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="66">The magnimity, and greatne&s;s of mind that di&s;tingui&s;hed many of the&s;e when per&s;ecuted, and put to death for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, cannot but command our admiration!&mdash;I &s;hall not &s;ay, whether Mr. Hume would have &s;hewn as much firmne&s;s in defence of his mo&s;t favourite tenets; but he has, I believe, never made any <HI>expen&s;ive &s;acrifices on the altar</HI> of <HI>truth and li|berty,</HI> con&s;equently not to be &s;et in competi|tion with <HI>tried, triumphant integrity.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>calm retreats</HI> of <HI>philo&s;ophic ea&s;e,</HI> call not forth the <HI>heroic virtues.</HI> In &s;uch retire|ments (&s;ometimes devoted to &s;ceptical di&s;qui|&s;itions) temptations to defection, have been, comparatively, but few; nor can individuals of this &s;ort much boa&s;t of having exhibited to the world, many in&s;tances of per&s;evering for|titude under per&s;ecuting trials, or of having met the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Terrors,</HI> in his mo&s;t awful ap|pearances with that <HI>generous contempt,</HI> or <HI>&s;ur|pri&s;ing re&s;olution</HI> which marked the exits of many chri&s;tian martyrs even at the <HI>&s;take,</HI> or when the <HI>flames</HI> had laid hold on them!</P>
<P>However moral and humane Mr. Hume may have been, (his merit is not controverted) yet his admirers ought not to celebrate his vir|tue
<PB N="70" REF="67">at the <HI>expence</HI> of the chri&s;tian character, (which we have &s;een is elevated) or, as if good <HI>morals,</HI> and <HI>dei&s;m,</HI> had before been &s;trangers!&mdash; Such triumph on account of goodne&s;s and hu|manity in a <HI>&s;ceptical individual,</HI> would &s;eem to mark a deficiency in eminent worth among tho&s;e of that ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, certain it is, that Mr. Hume's propo&s;itions, re&s;pecting CAUSE and EFFECT, would, if pur&s;ued in their con&s;e|quences, terminate nearly in athei&s;m: This hath been the opinion of wi&s;e and good men. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay, how &s;uch tenets tend to <HI>loo&s;en moral obligation,</HI> con&s;equently to de&s;troy the mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts</HI> of &s;ociety.&mdash;It is, therefore, with caution, that the young and unthinking &s;hould hear men of &s;uch principles, prai&s;ed, or &s;et above tho&s;e eminent profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, to which honour, I tru&s;t, it now appears they have not a ju&s;t claim.</P>
<P><HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in <HI>principle,</HI> has generally lead to <HI>libertin&s;m</HI> in practice, and I will a&s;&s;ert, "that the man who is bound by the <HI>awful &s;anctions</HI> of <HI>religion,</HI> may be mo&s;t depended on;" he bids faire&s;t for being the hone&s;t trader, the good neighbour, and citizen, the &s;incere friend, and
<PB N="71" REF="68">&s;teadfa&s;t lover of his country; or for di&s;charg|ing in a becoming manner, all the duties of civil and &s;ocial life. Nay, I know not, whe|ther it would be a breach of charity to &s;ay, "that <HI>doubters</HI> or <HI>unbelievers,</HI> have &s;eldombeen eminent for <HI>purity of manners, di&s;intere&s;ted bene|ficence,</HI> exalted piety, or for true magnanimity mind.</P>
<P>It is not to per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, that truth and liberty; the civil and religious rights of mankind; arts, &s;ciences and philo&s;ophy; the peace and happine&s;s of mens minds; or their advancement in u&s;eful knowledge, &s;ub|&s;tantial piety, and generous virtue, &s;tand emi|nently indebted.</P>
<P>On the contrary, many of them, have been the mo&s;t <HI>&s;uperficial, bigotted,</HI> and <HI>narrow minded</HI> of <HI>mortals;&mdash;covetous profligate, impious!</HI> under a pretence of greater freedom of thought than others, they have been known to take liberties incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>decency and good manners,</HI> or have openly attempted, by the <HI>coar&s;e&s;t buffoonery,</HI> to throw the mo&s;t venerable things into con|tempt. It were unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that <HI>calmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>true fortitude</HI> of &s;pirit, are not likely to be the death bed attendants on &s;uch men.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="69">The&s;e particulars will, it is hoped, &s;hew the <HI>futility,</HI> as well as fal&s;ehood of the a&s;&s;ertion we have been controverting, viz. "That, perhaps, it is one of the very wor&s;t circum|&s;tances again&s;t the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity, that very few of its profe&s;&s;ors were ever, either &s;o moral, &s;o humane, or could &s;o philo&s;ophically govern their pa&s;&s;ions, as the &s;ceptical David Hume."&mdash;A propo&s;ition, which if true, would not a little derogate from the dignity and im|portance of the chri&s;tian cau&s;e and character.</P>
<P>But, &s;urely, we need not re&s;t our <HI>moral defence</HI> entirely on the lives of eminent divines, phi|lo&s;ophers, &amp;c. as before named:&mdash;Have we not &s;een in common life, numerous in&s;tances of <HI>true greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>heroi&s;m;</HI>&mdash;a contempt of the world, and di&s;cipline of the pa&s;&s;ions in|&s;pired by chri&s;tianity.

<P>I cannot re&s;i&s;t concluding the&s;e remarks, in the words of a ju&s;tly admired writer. "To &s;ee a per&s;on (&s;ays he) of no more than com|mon under&s;tanding, a &s;tranger to all &s;cience

<P>&lindx; After this pamphlet had been written, the Editor&mdash;(to his &s;urprize) found, that the author of the Apology for the life and writings of David Hume, who hath thrown out &s;uch unmerited, fal&s;e accu&s;ations again&s;t the advocates for chri&s;tianity is no other than Courtney Melmoth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> author al&s;o of a book lately pub|li&s;hed, entitled "The <HI>Sublime and Beautiful of Scripture;</HI>"&mdash;in which he &s;ays, "I &s;hall account my&s;elf &s;ingularly fortunate, if &s;uch endeavours have in any degree, done a &s;ervice to compo&s;itions which are &s;o able to &s;upport the trial."</P>
<P>The incon&s;i&s;tency and contradictions which &s;o &s;trongly mark the writings of this declamatory publi&s;her, in the two productions above-mentioned, would &s;eem deeply to <HI>affect</HI> his <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> or lay him open to be <HI>taxed</HI> with that <HI>bypocri&s;y,</HI> of which, he would in|&s;inuate, the <HI>friends of revealed religion,</HI> &s;tand chargeable.</P>

<HEAD>THE Earl of CHESTERFIELD's SPEECH AGAINST LICENSING the STAGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Bill now before you I apprehend to be of a very extraordinary, a very dangerous nature. It &s;eems de&s;igned not only as a re|&s;traint on the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage, but it will prove a mo&s;t arbitrary re&s;traint on the liberty of the Stage; and, I fear, it looks yet farther; I fear, it tends towards a re&s;traint on the liberty of the Pre&s;s, which will be a long &s;tride towards the de&s;truction of liberty it&s;elf. It is not only a Bill, my L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds, of a very ex|traordinary nature, but it has been brought in at a very extraordinary &s;ea&s;on, and pu&s;hed
<PB N="78" REF="74">with mo&s;t extraordinary di&s;patch. When I con&s;ider how near it was to the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and how long this &s;e&s;&s;ion had been protracted beyond the u&s;ual time of the year; when I con&s;idered that this Bill pa&s;&s;ed through the other Hou&s;e with &s;o much precipitancy, as even to get the &s;tart of a Bill which de&s;erved all the re&s;pect, and all the di&s;patch, the forms of either Hou&s;e of Parliament could admit of, it &s;et me upon enquiring, what could be the rea&s;on for introducing this Bill at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a time, and pre&s;&s;ing it forward in a manner &s;o very &s;ingular and uncommon. I have made all po&s;&s;ible inquiry, and as yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am at a lo&s;s to find out the great occa&s;ion. I have, it is true, learned from common report without doors, that a mo&s;t &s;editious, a mo&s;t heinous farce had been offered to one of the theatres, a farce for which the authors ought to be puni&s;hed in the mo&s;t exemplary manner: But what was the con&s;equence? the ma&s;ter of that theatre behaved as he was in duty bound, and as common prudence directed: He not only re|fu&s;ed to bring it upon the Stage, but carried it to a certain Honourable Gentleman in the Admini&s;tration, as the &s;ure&s;t method of having it ab&s;olutely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Could this be the oc|ca&s;ion of introducing &s;uch an extraordinary
<PB N="79" REF="75">Bill, at &s;uch an extraordinary &s;ea&s;on, and pu&s;h|ing it in &s;o extraordinary a manner? Surely no;&mdash;the dutiful behaviour of the player, the prudent caution they &s;hewed upon that occa|&s;ion, can never be a rea&s;on for &s;ubjecting them to &s;uch an arbitrary re&s;traint: It is an argu|ment in their favour, and a material one, in my opinion, again&s;t the Bill. Nay farther, if we con&s;ider all circum&s;tances, it is to me a full proof that the laws now in being are &s;ufficient for puni&s;hing tho&s;e players who &s;hall venture to bring any &s;editious libel upon the Stage, and con&s;equently &s;ufficient for deterring all players from acting any thing that may have the lea&s;t tendency towards giving a rea&s;onable offence.</P>
<P>I do not, my Lords, pretend to be a law|yer, I do not pretend to know perfectly the power and extent of our laws, but I have con|ver&s;ed with tho&s;e that do, and by them I have been told, that our laws are &s;ufficient for puni&s;hing any per&s;on that &s;hall dare to repre|&s;ent upon the Stage what may appear, either by the words or the repre&s;entation, to be bla&s;|phemous, &s;editious, or immoral. I mu&s;t own, indeed, I have ob&s;erved of late a remarkable licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the Stage. There have but very lately been two plays acted, which, one
<PB N="80" REF="76">would have thought, &s;hould have given the greate&s;t offence, and yet both were &s;uffered to be often repre&s;ented without di&s;turbance, with|out cen&s;ure. In one, the author thought fit to repre&s;ent the three great profe&s;&s;ions, Re|ligion, Phy&s;ic, and the Law, as incon&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e: In the other, a mo&s;t tra|gical &s;tory was brought upon the &s;tage, a ca|ta&s;trophe too recent, too melancholy, and of too &s;olemn a nature, to be heard of any where but from the pulpit. How the&s;e pieces came to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, I do not know: If I am rightly informed, it was not for want of law, but for want of pro&s;ecution, without which no law can be made effectual: But if there was any neglect in this ca&s;e, I am convinced it was not with a de&s;ign to prepare the minds of the people, and to make them think a new law nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Our Stage ought certainly, my Lords, to be kept within bounds; but for this, our laws as they &s;tand at pre&s;ent are &s;ufficient: If our &s;tage-players at any time exceed tho&s;e bounds, they ought to be pro&s;ecuted, they may be puni&s;hed: We have precedents, we have ex|amples of per&s;ons having been puni&s;hed for things le&s;s criminal than either of the two pieces I have mentioned. A new law mu&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="77">therefore be unnece&s;&s;ary, and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it cannot be unnece&s;&s;ary without being dangerous: Every unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint on li|centiou&s;ne&s;s is a fetter upon the legs, is a &s;hackle upon the hands of liberty. One of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings a people, my Lords, can enjoy, is liberty;&mdash;but every good in this life has its alloy of evil:&mdash;Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is the alloy of liberty; it is an ebullition, an excre&s;cence;&mdash; it is a &s;peck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle,&mdash; with a trembling hand, le&s;t I de&s;troy the body, le&s;t I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear. If the Stage becomes at any time li|centious; if a play appears to be a libel upon the government, or upon any particular man, the king's courts are open, the laws are &s;uf|ficient for puni&s;hing the offender; and in this ca&s;e the per&s;on injured has a &s;ingular advan|tage; he can be under no difficulty to prove who is the publi&s;her; the players them&s;elves are the publi&s;hers, and there can be no want of evidence to convict them.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, &s;uppo&s;e it true, that the laws now in being are not &s;ufficient for putting a check to or preventing the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage: &s;uppo&s;e it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome
<PB N="82" REF="78">new law &s;hould be made for that purpo&s;e; yet it mu&s;t be granted that &s;uch a law ought to be maturely con&s;idered, and every clau&s;e, every &s;entence, nay every word of it well weighed and examined, le&s;t under &s;ome of tho&s;e me|thods, pre&s;umed or pretended to be nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;training licentiou&s;ne&s;s, a power &s;hould lie concealed, which might be afterwards made u&s;e of for giving a dangerous would to li|berty. Such a law ought not to be introduced at the clo&s;e of a &s;e&s;&s;ion, nor ought we, in the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;uch a law, to depart from any of the forms pre&s;cribed by our ance&s;tors for pre|venting deceit and &s;urprize. There is &s;uch a connection between licentiou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, that it is not ea&s;y to correct the one, without dangerou&s;ly wounding the other: It is extreme|ly hard to di&s;tingui&s;h the true limit between them: like a changeable &s;ilk, we can ea&s;ily &s;ee there are two different colours, but we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover where the one ends, or where the other begins.&mdash;There can be no great and immediate danger from the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tage: I hope it will not be pretended that our government may, before next winter, be overturned by &s;uch licentiou&s;ne&s;s, even though our Stage were at pre&s;ent under no &s;ort of legal controul. Why then may we not delay till next &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ing any law
<PB N="83" REF="79">again&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage? Nei|ther our government can be altered, nor our con&s;titution overturned by &s;uch a delay; but by pa&s;&s;ing a law ra&s;hly and unadvi&s;edly, our con&s;titution may at once be de&s;troyed, and our government rendered arbitrary. Can we then put a &s;mall, a &s;hort-lived inconvenience in the balance with perpetual &s;lavery? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a parliament of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> will &s;o much as ri&s;que the latter, for the &s;ake of avoiding the former?</P>
<P>Surely, my Lords, this is not to be expect|ed, were the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tage much greater than it is, were the in&s;ufficiency of our laws more obvious than can be pretended; but when we complain of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage, and of the in&s;ufficiency of our laws, I fear we have more rea&s;on to com|plain of bad mea&s;ures in our polity, and a general decay of virtue and morality among the people. In public as well as private life, the only way to prevent being ridiculed or cen&s;ured, is to avoid all ridiculous or wicked mea&s;ures, and to pur&s;ue &s;uch only as are virtuous and worthy. The people never en|deavour to ridicule tho&s;e they love and e&s;teem, nor will they &s;uffer them to be ri|diculed: If any one attempts it, the ridicule
<PB N="84" REF="80">returns upon the author: he makes him&s;elf only the object of public hatred and contempt. The actions or behaviour of a private man may pa&s;s unob&s;erved, and con&s;equently unapplaud|ed, uncen&s;ured; but the actions of tho&s;e in high &s;tations, can neither pa&s;s without no|tice, nor without cen&s;ure or applau&s;e; and therefore an admini&s;tration without e&s;teem, without authority among the people, let their power be ever &s;o great, let their power be ever &s;o arbitrary, they will be ridiculed: The &s;evere&s;t edicts, the mo&s;t terrible puni&s;hments, cannot entirely prevent it. If any man therefore thinks he has been cen&s;ured; if any man thinks he has been ri|diculed upon any of our public theatres, let him examine his actions he will find the cau&s;e, let him alter his conduct he will find a re|medy. As no man is perfect, as no man is infallible, the greate&s;t may err, the mo&s;t cir|cum&s;pect may be guilty of &s;ome piece of ridi|culous behaviour. It is not licentiou&s;ne&s;s, it is an u&s;eful liberty always indulged the Stage in a free country, that &s;ome great men may there meet with a ju&s;t reproof, which none of their friends will be free enough or rather faithful enough to give them. Of this we have a famous in&s;tance in the <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;tory. The great <HI>Pompey,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="81">after the many victories he had obtained, and the great conque&s;ts he had made, had cer|tainly a good title to the e&s;teem of the people of <HI>Rome;</HI> yet that great man, by &s;ome error in his conduct, became an object of general di&s;like; and therefore, in the repre&s;entation of an old play, when <HI>Diphilus,</HI> the actor, came to repeat the&s;e words, <HI>No&s;tra Mi&s;eria tu es Magnus,</HI> the audience immediately applied them to <HI>Pompey,</HI> who at that time was as well known by the name <HI>Magnus,</HI> as by the name <HI>Pompey,</HI> and were &s;o highly plea&s;ed with the &s;atire, that, as <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, they made the actor repeat the words an hundred times over: An account of this was immediately &s;ent to <HI>Pompey,</HI> who, in&s;tead of re&s;enting it as an injury, was &s;o wi&s;e as to take it for a ju&s;t reproof: He examined his conduct, he altered his mea&s;ures, he regained by de|grees the e&s;teem of the people, and then he neither feared the wit, nor felt the &s;atire of the Stage. This is an example which ought to be followed by great men in all countries. Such accidents will often happen in every free country, and many &s;uch would probably have afterwards happened at <HI>Rome,</HI> if they had continued to enjoy their liberty; but this &s;ort of liberty in the Stage, came &s;oon after, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be called licentiou&s;ne&s;s;
<PB N="86" REF="82">for we are told that <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> after having e&s;tabli&s;hed his Empire, re&s;tored order to <HI>Rome</HI> by re&s;training licentiou&s;ne&s;s. God forbid! we &s;hould in this country have order re&s;tored, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s re&s;trained, at &s;o dear a rate as the people of <HI>Rome</HI> paid for it to <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>In the ca&s;e I have mentioned, my Lords, it was not the poet that wrote, for it was an old play, nor the players that acted, for they only repeated the words of the play; it was the people who pointed the &s;atire; and the ca&s;e will always be the &s;ame: When a man has the misfortune to incur the hatred or contempt of the people, when public mea|&s;ures are de&s;pi&s;ed, the audience will apply what never was, what could not be de&s;igned as a &s;atire on the pre&s;ent times. Nay, even though the people &s;hould not apply, tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of guilt, tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of the wickedne&s;s or weakne&s;s of their own conduct, will take to them&s;elves what the author never de&s;igned. A public thief is as apt to take the fatire as he is apt to take the money, which was never de|&s;igned for him. We have an in&s;tance of this in the ca&s;e of a famous comedian of the la&s;t age; a comedian who was not only a good poet, but an hone&s;t man, and a quiet
<PB N="87" REF="83">and good &s;ubject: The famous <HI>Moliere</HI> when he wrote his <HI>Tartuffe,</HI> which is certainly an excellent and a good moral comedy, did not de&s;ign to &s;atirize any great man of that age; yet a great man in <HI>France</HI> at that time took it to him&s;elf, and fancied the author had taken him as a model for one of the principal and one of the wor&s;t characters in that comedy: By good luck he was not the licen&s;er, other|wi&s;e the kingdom of <HI>France</HI> had never had the plea&s;ure, the happine&s;s, I may &s;ay, of &s;eeing that play acted; but when the play|ers fir&s;t propo&s;ed to act it at <HI>Paris,</HI> he had intere&s;t enough to get it forbid. <HI>Moliere,</HI> who knew him&s;elf innocent of what was laid to his charge, complained to his patron the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> that as his play was de|&s;igned only to expo&s;e hypocri&s;y, and a fal&s;e pretence to religion, it was very hard it &s;hould be forbid being acted, when at the &s;ame time they were &s;uffered to expo&s;e re|ligion it&s;elf every night publicly upon the <HI>Italian</HI> &s;tage. To which the Prince wittily an&s;wered, <HI>'Tis true,</HI> Moliere, <HI>Harlequin ridi|cules Heaven, and expo&s;es Religion; but you have done much wor&s;e&mdash;you have ridiculed the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="84">I am as much for re&s;training the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of the Stage, and every other &s;ort of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, as any of your Lord&s;hips can be; but, my Lords, I am, I &s;hall always be ex|tremely cautious and fearful of making the lea&s;t encroachment upon liberty; and there|fore, when a new law is propo&s;ed again&s;t li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;hall always be for con&s;idering it deliberately and maturely, before I venture to give my con&s;ent to its being pa&s;&s;ed. This is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for my being again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing this Bill at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a time, and in &s;o extraordinary a manner; but I have my rea&s;ons for being again&s;t the Bill it&s;elf, &s;ome of which I &s;hall beg leave to explain to your Lord&s;hips. The Bill, my Lords, at fir&s;t view, may &s;eem to be de&s;igned only a|gain&s;t the Stage, but to me it plainly appears to point &s;omewhere el&s;e. It is an arrow that does but glance upon the Stage, the mortal wound &s;eems de&s;igned again&s;t the liberty of the pre&s;s. By this Bill you prevent a play be|ing acted, but you do not prevent its being printed; therefore, if a licence &s;hould be re|fu&s;ed for its being acted, we may depend on it the play will be printed. It will be printed and publi&s;hed, my Lords, with the refu&s;al in capital letters on the title page. People are always fond of what is forbidden. <HI>Libri pro|hibiti</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="85">are in all countries diligently and ge|nerally &s;ought after. It will be much ea&s;ier to procure a refu&s;al, than it ever was to pro|cure a good hou&s;e, or a good &s;ale: There|fore we may expect, that plays will be wrote on purpo&s;e to have a refu&s;al: This will cer|tainly procure a good &s;ale: Thus will &s;atires be &s;pread and di&s;per&s;ed through the whole na|tion, and thus every man in the kingdom may and probably will, read for &s;ixpence, what a few only could have &s;een acted and that not under the expence of half a crown. We &s;hall then be told, What! Will you allow an in|famous libel to be printed and di&s;per&s;ed, which you would not allow to be acted? You have agreed to a law for preventing its be|ing acted, can you refu&s;e your a&s;&s;ent to a law for preventing its being printed and publi&s;h|ed? I &s;hould really my Lords, be glad to hear what excu&s;e, what rea&s;on one could give for being again&s;t the latter, after having a|greed to the former; for, I prote&s;t I can|not &s;ugge&s;t to my&s;elf the lea&s;t &s;hadow of an excu&s;e. If we agree to the Bill now be|fore us, we mu&s;t perhaps next &s;e&s;&s;ion, agree to a Bill for preventing any play being printed without a licence. Then &s;atires will be wrote by way of novels, &s;ecret hi&s;tories, dialogues, or under &s;ome &s;uch title; and thereupon we &s;hall
<PB N="90" REF="86">be told, What! Will you allow an infamous libel to be printed and di&s;per&s;ed, only becau&s;e it does not bear the title of a play? Thus, my Lords, from the precedent now before us, we &s;hall be induced, nay we can find no rea&s;on for refu&s;ing to lay the pre&s;s under a general li|cence, and then we may bid adieu to the liber|ties of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, my Lords, it were nece&s;&s;ary to make a new law for the re&s;training the li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage, which I am very far from granting, yet I &s;hall never be for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing &s;uch a power as is propo&s;ed by this Bill. If poets and players are to be re&s;trained, let them be re&s;trained as other &s;ubjects are, by the known laws of their country; if they of|fend, let them be tried as every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> ought to be, by God and their country. Do not let us &s;ubject them to the arbitrary will and plea&s;ure of any one man. A power lodged in the hands of one &s;ingle man, to judge and determine, without any limitation, without any controul or appeal, is a &s;ort of power un|known to our laws, incon&s;i&s;tent with our con|&s;titution. It is a higher, a more ab&s;olute power than we tru&s;t even to the King him|&s;elf; and therefore I mu&s;t think, we ought not to ve&s;t any &s;uch power in his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="91" REF="87">Lord Chamberlain. When I &s;ay this, I am &s;ure I do not mean to give the lea&s;t, the mo&s;t di&s;tant offence to the noble Duke who now fills the po&s;t of Lord Chamberlain: His na|tural candour and love of ju&s;tice, would not, I know, permit him to exerci&s;e any power but with the &s;tricte&s;t regard to the rules of ju&s;tice and humanity. Were we &s;ure his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in that high office would always be per&s;ons of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, even the power to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by this Bill could give me no farther alarm, than le&s;t it &s;hould be made a precedent for introducing other new powers of the &s;ame nature. This, indeed, is an alarm which cannot be avoided, which cannot be prevented by any hope, by any con&s;ideration; it is an alarm which, I think, every man mu&s;t take, who has a due regard to the con&s;titution and liberties of his country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall admit, my Lords, that the Stage ought not upon any occa&s;ion to meddle with politics, and for this very rea&s;on, among the re&s;t, I am again&s;t the Bill now before us: This Bill will be &s;o far from preventing the Stage's meddling with politics, that I fear it will be the occa&s;ion of its meddling with no|thing el&s;e; but then it will be a political Stage <HI>ex parte.</HI> It will be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the
<PB N="92" REF="88">politics and &s;chemes of the court only. The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage will be encouraged in&s;tead of being re&s;trained; but, like court|journali&s;ts, it will be licentious only again&s;t the patrons of liberty, and the protectors of the people. Whatever man, whatever party oppo&s;es the court in any of their mo&s;t de|&s;tructive &s;chemes, will, upon the Stage, be re|pre&s;ented in the mo&s;t ridiculous light the hirelings of a court can contrive. True patrioti&s;m and love of public good will be repre&s;ented as madne&s;s, or as a cloak for envy, di&s;appointment and malice; while the mo&s;t flagitious crimes, the mo&s;t extravagant vices and follies, if they are fa&s;hionable at court, will be di&s;gui&s;ed and dre&s;t up in the habit of the mo&s;t amiable virtues. This has formerly been the ca&s;e:&mdash;In King <HI>Charles</HI> IId's days the play-hou&s;e was under a licence. What was the con&s;equence?&mdash;The play|hou&s;e retailed nothing but the politics, the vices, and the follies of the court: Not to expo&s;e them; no&mdash;but to recommend them; though it mu&s;t be granted their poli|tics were often as bad as their vices, and much more pernicious than their other fol|lies. It is true, the court had, at that time, a great deal of wit; it was then indeed full of men of true wit and great humour; but
<PB N="93" REF="89">it was the more dangerous; for the courtiers did then, as thorough-paced courtiers always will do, they &s;acrificed their honour, by mak|ing their wit and their humour &s;ub&s;ervient to the court only; and what made it &s;till appear more dangerous, no man could appear upon the &s;tage again&s;t them. We know that <HI>Dryden,</HI> the Poet Laureat of that reign, always repre|&s;ents the cavaliers as hone&s;t, brave, merry fel|lows, and fine gentlemen: Indeed, his fine gentleman, as he generally draws him, is an athei&s;tical, lewd, abandoned fellow, which was at that time, it &s;eems, the fa&s;hionable cha|racter at court. On the other hand, he always repre&s;ents the di&s;&s;enters as hypocritical, di&s;|&s;embling rogues, or &s;tupid &s;en&s;ele&s;s boobies. &mdash;When the court had a mind to fall out with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he wrote his <HI>Amboyna,</HI> in which he repre&s;ents the <HI>Dutch</HI> as a pack of avariti|ous, cruel, ungrateful ra&s;cals.&mdash;And when the Exclu&s;ion Bill was moved in parliament, he wrote his <HI>Duke of Gui&s;e,</HI> in which tho&s;e who were for pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring the religion of their country, were expo&s;ed under the cha|racter of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> and his party, who leagued together, for excluding <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France</HI> from the throne, on account of his re|ligion. &mdash;The city of <HI>London</HI> too, was made to feel the partial and mercenary licentiou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="94" REF="90">of the Stage at that time; for the citizens having at that time, as well as now, a great deal of property, they had a mind to pre&s;erve that property, and therefore they oppo&s;ed &s;ome of the arbitrary mea&s;ures which were then be|gun, but pur&s;ued more openly in the following reign; for which rea&s;on they were then al|ways repre&s;ented upon the Stage, as a parcel of de&s;igning knaves, di&s;&s;embling hypocrites, griping u&s;urers, and&mdash;cuckolds into the bar|gain.</P>
<P>My Lords, the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage, and that for which only it is u&s;eful, is to ex|po&s;e tho&s;e vices and follies, which the laws cannot lay hold of, and to recommend tho&s;e beauties and virtues, which mini&s;ters and cour|tiers &s;eldom either imitate or reward; but by laying it under a licence, and under an arbi|trary court-licence too, you will, in my opi|nion, intirely pervert its u&s;e; for though I have the greate&s;t e&s;teem for that noble Duke, in who&s;e hands this power is at pre&s;ent de&s;ign|ed to fall, though I have an intire confidence in his judgment and impartiality; yet I may &s;uppo&s;e that a leaning towards the fa&s;hions of a court is &s;ometimes hard to be avoided.&mdash;It may be very difficult to make one who is every day at court believe that to be a vice or folly,
<PB N="95" REF="91">which he &s;ees daily practi&s;ed by tho&s;e he loves and e&s;teems.&mdash;By cu&s;tom even deformity it&s;elf becomes familiar, and at la&s;t agreeable.&mdash; To &s;uch a per&s;on, let his natural impartiality be ever &s;o great, that may appear a libel again&s;t the court, which is only a mo&s;t ju&s;t and a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;atire upon the fa&s;hionable vices and follies of the court. Courtiers, my Lords, are too polite to reprove one another; the only place where they can meet with any ju&s;t reproof, is a free, though not a licentious Stage; and as every &s;ort of vice and folly, generally in all countries, begins at court, and from thence &s;preads through the country, by laying the Stage under an arbitrary court-licence, in|&s;tead of leaving it what it is, and always ought to be, a gentle &s;courge for the vices of great men and courtiers, you will make it a canal for propagating and conveying their vices and follies through the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>From hence, my Lords, I think it mu&s;t ap|pear, that the Bill now before us cannot &s;o properly be called a Bill for re&s;training the li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, as it may be called a Bill for re|&s;training the liberty of the Stage, and for re|&s;training it too in that branch which in all countries has been the mo&s;t u&s;eful; therefore I mu&s;t look upon the Bill as a mo&s;t dangerous
<PB N="96" REF="92">encroachment upon liberty in general. Nay farther, my Lords, it is not only an encroach|ment upon liberty, but it is likewi&s;e an en|croachment on property. Wit, my Lords, is a &s;ort of property: It is the property of tho&s;e that have it, and too often the only property they have to depend on. It is, indeed, but a precarious dependance. Thank God! we, my Lords, have a dependance of another kind, we have a much le&s;s precarious &s;up|port, and therefore, cannot feel the incon|veniencies of the Bill now before us; but it is our duty to encourage and protect wit, who&s;oever's property it may be. Tho&s;e gen|tlemen who have any &s;uch property, are all, I hope, our friends: Do not let us &s;ubject them to any unnece&s;&s;ary or arbitrary re&s;traint. I mu&s;t own, I cannot ea&s;ily agree to the laying of any tax upon wit; but by this Bill it is to be heavily taxed,&mdash;it is to be exci&s;ed;&mdash;for if this Bill pa&s;&s;es, it cannot be retailed in a proper way without a permit; and the Lord Cham|berlain is to have the honour of being chief gauger, &s;upervi&s;or, commi&s;&s;ioner, judge and jury: But what is &s;till more hard, though the poor author, the proprietor I &s;hould &s;ay, can|not perhaps dine till he has found out and a|greed with a purcha&s;er; yet before he can propo&s;e to &s;eek for a purcha&s;er, he mu&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="93">patiently &s;ubmit to have his goods rummaged at their new exci&s;e-office, where they may be detained for fourteen days, and even then he may find them returned as prohibited goods, by which his chief and be&s;t market will be for ever &s;hut again&s;t him; and that without any cau&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea|&s;on, either from the laws of his country, or the laws of the Stage.</P>
<P>The&s;e hard&s;hips, this hazard, which every gentleman will be expo&s;ed to who writes any thing for the Stage, mu&s;t certainly prevent every man of a generous and free &s;pirit from attempting any thing in that way; and as the Stage has always been the proper chan|nel for wit and humour, therefore, my Lords, when I &s;peak again&s;t this Bill, I mu&s;t think I plead the cau&s;e of wit, I plead the cau&s;e of humour, I plead the cau&s;e of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage, and of every gentleman of ta&s;te in the kingdom: But it is not, my Lords, for the &s;ake of wit only; even for the &s;ake of his Maje&s;ty's Lord Chamber|lain, I mu&s;t be again&s;t this Bill. The noble Duke who has now the honour to execute that office, has, I am &s;ure, as little inclination to di&s;oblige as any man; but if this Bill pa&s;&s;es, he mu&s;t di&s;oblige, he may di&s;oblige &s;ome of his mo&s;t intimate
<PB N="98" REF="94">friends. It is impo&s;&s;ible to write a play, but &s;ome of the characters, or &s;ome of the &s;atire, may be interpreted &s;o as to point at &s;ome per&s;on or other, perhaps at &s;ome per&s;on in an eminent &s;tation: When it comes to be acted, the people will make the application, and the per&s;on again&s;t whom the application is made, will think him&s;elf injured, and will, at lea&s;t privately, re&s;ent it: At pre&s;ent this re&s;entment can be directed only again&s;t the author; but when an author's play appears with my Lord Chamberlain's pa&s;&s;port, every &s;uch re&s;entment will be turned from the au|thor, and pointed directly again&s;t the Lord Chamberlain, who by his &s;tamp made the piece current. What an unthankful office are we therefore by this Bill to put upon his Maje&s;ty's Lord Chamberlain! an office which can no way contribute to his honour or profit, and yet &s;uch a one as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily gain him a great deal of ill will, and create him a number of enemies.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rea&s;on I &s;hall trouble your Lord|&s;hips with for my being again&s;t the Bill, is, that in my opinion, it will no way an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed: I mean the end openly pro|po&s;ed, and, I am &s;ure, the only end which your Lord&s;hips propo&s;e. To prevent the act|ing
<PB N="99" REF="95">of a play which has any tendency to bla&s;phemy, immorality, &s;edition, or private &s;candal, can &s;ignify nothing, unle&s;s you can likewi&s;e prevent its being printed and pub|li&s;hed. On the contrary, if you prevent its being acted, and admit of its being printed and publi&s;hed, you will propagate the mi&s;|chief: Your prohibition will prove a bellows which will blow up the fire you intend to extingui&s;h. This Bill can therefore be of no u&s;e for preventing either the public or the private injury intended by &s;uch a play; and con&s;equently can be of no manner of u&s;e, unle&s;s it be de&s;igned as a precedent, as a leading &s;tep towards another, for &s;ubject|ing the Pre&s;s likewi&s;e to a licen&s;er. For &s;uch a wicked purpo&s;e it may, indeed, be of great u&s;e; and in that light, it may mo&s;t properly be called a &s;tep towards arbitrary power.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider, my Lords, that arbitrary power has &s;eldom or ever been introduced into any country at once. It mu&s;t be intro|duced by &s;low degrees, and as it were &s;tep by &s;tep, le&s;t the people &s;hould perceive its approach. The barriers and &s;ences of the people's liberty mu&s;t be plucked up one by one, and &s;ome plau&s;ible pretences mu&s;t be
<PB N="100" REF="96">found for removing or hood-winking, one after another, tho&s;e &s;entries who are po&s;ted by the con&s;titution of every free country, for warning the people of their danger. When the&s;e preparatory &s;teps are once made, the people may then, indeed, with regret &s;ee &s;lavery and arbitrary power making long &s;trides over their land, but it will then be too late to think of preventing or avoiding the impending ruin. The Stage, my Lords, and the Pre&s;s, are two of our out-&s;entries; if we remove them,&mdash;if we hood-wink them,&mdash;if we throw them in fetters,&mdash; the enemy may &s;urprize us. Therefore I mu&s;t look upon the Bill now before us as a &s;tep, and a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep too, for in|troducing arbitrary power into this kingdom: It is a &s;tep &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that, if ever any future ambitious king, or guilty mini&s;ter, &s;hould form to him&s;elf &s;o wicked a de&s;ign, he will have rea&s;on to thank us for having done &s;o much of the work to his hand; but &s;uch thanks, or thanks from &s;uch a man, I am convinced every one of your Lord|&s;hips would blu&s;h to receive,&mdash;and &s;corn to de&s;erve <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this Bill, which pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, all copies of plays, farces, or any thing wrote in the dramatic way, are to lie before his Grace the Lord Chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold for the time being, for his Grace's peru&s;al and appro|bation, before they &s;hall be exhibited on the Stage.</NOTE></P>

<P>That your Petitioner is little apt, and always unwilling, to &s;peak advantageou&s;ly of him&s;elf; but as, after all, &s;ome ju&s;tice is due to one's|&s;elf, as well as to others, he begs leave to re|pre&s;ent, That his loyalty to your Maje&s;ty has al|ways been un&s;haken, even in the wor&s;t of times; That, particularly, in the late unnatural rebel|lion, when the Pretender advanced as far as Derby, at the head of, at lea&s;t, three thou&s;and undi&s;ciplined men, the flower of the Scotti&s;h Nobility and Gentry, your Petitioner did not join him, as unque&s;tionably he might have done, had he been &s;o inclined; but, on the contrary, rai&s;ed &s;ixteen companies, of one hundred men each, at the public expence, in &s;upport of your Maje&s;ty's undoubted right to the Imperial
