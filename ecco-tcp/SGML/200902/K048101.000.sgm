<L>Have Patience good Captain, I'll open the Scene:</L>
<L>You mu&s;t know that in <HI>London</HI> &s;ome <HI>People</HI> there are,</L>

<L>oh then 'tis all well</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> Engli&s;h mu&s;t follow them THO' 'TWERE TO HELL;</L>

<L>Each <HI>Monkey,</HI> would after them, like a <HI>Brave Fellow,</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L>As <HI>they've</HI> done now by <HI>playing the Fool</HI> &mdash;and OTHELLO.</L>
<L>There's a <HI>Fable</HI> I learn'd it at School Years ago,</L>
<L>I'll relate it, I think it is <HI>quite apropo:</HI></L>
<L>On a Time, as (Fame &s;ays) the <HI>Apes acted a Play:</HI></L>
<L>Tho I know not the Date of the Year or the Day,</L>
<L>Nor is it material &s;ince it was enacted.</L>
<L>And For <HI>Apes,</HI> 'twas done better than could be Expected?</L>
<L>The <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> Soon heard on't and <HI>they</HI> mu&s;t Needs try.</L>
<L>Yet they u&s;ed this Precaution that <HI>None &s;hould be by,</HI></L>
<L>But Tho&s;e Who Were <HI>really A&s;ses</HI> indeed:</L>
<L>For (&s;ays they) they may Laugh? if we do not Succeed;</L>
<L>But our <HI>Gentry</HI> So <HI>Confident bold,</HI> and <HI>Conceited,</HI></L>
<L>Ne'ver u&s;ed this Precaution, But Fairly admitted.</L>
<L>An <HI>Audience of Critics,</HI> To See their Fine <HI>Play,</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Then the A&s;ses In Fact Acted wiser than They.</HI></L>
<L>Pray How Was't Receiv'd were the <HI>Hearers</HI> quite <HI>Civil?</HI></L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Ay,</HI> or else the <HI>Whole Play</HI> had Gone <HI>Sou&s;e to the Devil.</HI></L>

<L>I Believe &s;o by G-d.</L>

<L>Why <HI>FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS</HI> our papers declare.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Fifteen Hundred!</HI> D'ye Say, Why G-d Dam my Blood</L>
<L>So much Money Spent to do no Sort of Good,</L>
<L>How much more Commendable would it have been?</L>
<L>Since Objects of Pity So frequent are &s;een.</L>
<L>With benevolent Hands to have giv'n it to Tho&s;e,</L>

<L>Faith Captain you're right, <HI>my</HI> Opinion's the &s;ame,</L>
<L>For in <HI>every Re&s;pect</HI> they are <HI>greatly to blame:</HI></L>
<L>Now <HI>if</HI> I was an Actor, <HI>this Method</HI> I'd take,</L>
<L>The <HI>Stage</HI> and its <HI>Drudgery</HI> both I'd <HI>for&s;ake;</HI></L>
