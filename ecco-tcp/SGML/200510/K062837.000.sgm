<P>_THERE is a Plea|&s;ure

Obligations which it is
<PB REF="3">
an Honour to have re|ceived,
but &s;hould I pub|li&s;h
any Favours done

I am afraid it would look
more like Vanity than
Gratitude.</P>
<P>I had a very early

which yet encreas'd in

&s;ome Account: For
whatever great Impre&s;|&s;ions
an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> mu&s;t

very few of Your Well-wi&s;hers

<P>I here pre&s;ent Your

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is certainly no
Place in the World where
a Man may Travel with
greater Plea&s;ure and Ad|vantage
than in <HI>Italy.</HI>
One finds &s;omething more particu|lar
in the Face of the Country, and
more a&s;toni&s;hing in the Works of
Nature, than can be met with in
any other Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is
the great School of Mu&s;ick and
Painting, and contains in it all the
noble&s;t Productions of Statuary and
Architecture both Ancient and Mo|dern.
It abounds with Cabinets of
Curio&s;ities, and va&s;t Collections of
all Kinds of Antiquities. No o|ther
Country in the World has &s;uch
a Variety of Governments, that
are &s;o different in their Con&s;titu|tions,
and &s;o refined in their Po|liticks.
<PB REF="9">
There is &s;carce any Part
of the Nation that is not Famous
in Hi&s;tory, nor &s;o much as a Moun|tain
or River that has not been the
Scene of &s;ome extraordinary Action.</P>
<P>As there are few Men that have
Talents or Opportunities for exa|mining
&s;o copious a Subject, one
may ob&s;erve among tho&s;e who have
written on <HI>Italy,</HI> that different Au|thors
have &s;ucceeded be&s;t on diffe|rent
&s;orts of Curio&s;ities. Some have
been more particular in their Ac|counts
of Pictures, Statues and
Buildings; &s;ome have &s;earch'd in|to
Libraries, Cabinets of Rarities,
and Collections of Medals, as others
have been wholly taken up with In|&s;criptions,
Ruins and Antiquities.
Among the Authors of our own Coun|try,
we are obliged to the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> for his ma&s;terly and uncom|mon
Ob&s;ervations on the Religion and
Governments of <HI>Italy</HI>: <HI>La&s;&s;els</HI> may
be u&s;eful in giving us the Names of
&s;uch Writers as have treated of the
&s;everal States through which he
<PB REF="10">
pa&s;s'd: Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> is to be valu'd for
his Ob&s;ervations on the Natural
Productions of the Place. Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> has wrote a more correct
Account of <HI>Italy</HI> in general than
any before him, as he particularly
Excels in the Plan of the Country,
which he has given us in true and
lively Colours.</P>
<P>There are &s;till &s;everal of the&s;e
Topicks that are far from being
exhau&s;ted, as there are many new
Subjects that a Traveller may find
to employ him&s;elf upon. For my
own part, as I have taken Notice of
&s;everal Places and Antiquities that
no Body el&s;e has &s;poken of, &s;o, I
think, I have mentioned but few
Things in common with others, that
are notei ther &s;et in a new Light,
or accompany'd with different Re|flections.
I have taken care parti|cularly
to con&s;ider the &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages
of the Ancient Poets, which
have any Relation to the Places
or Curio&s;ities that I met with: For
before I entered on my Voyage I took
<PB REF="11">
care to refre&s;h my Memory among
the <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic</HI> Authors, and to make
&s;uch Collections out of them as I
might afterwards have Occa&s;ion
for. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it was not one
of the lea&s;t Entertainments that I
met with in Travelling, to examine
the&s;e &s;everal De&s;criptions, as it
were, upon the Spot, and to compare
the Natural Face of the Country
with the Landskips that the Poets
have given us of it. However,
to avoid the Confu&s;ion that might
ari&s;e from a Multitude of Quotati|ons,
I have only cited &s;uch Ver&s;es
as have given us &s;ome Image of the
Place, or that have &s;omething el&s;e
be&s;ides the bare Name of it to re|commend
them.</P>

forced, by contrary Winds, into St. <HI>Re|mo,</HI>
a very pretty Town in the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI>

large, but there are a great many Hou&s;es
behind it, built up the Side of the Moun|tain,
to avoid the Winds and Vapours
that come from Sea. We here &s;aw &s;e|veral
Per&s;ons, that in the mid&s;t of <HI>De|cember</HI>

is free from the greate&s;t Inconvenience,

failed from hence directly for <HI>Genoa,</HI> and
had a fair Wind that carried us into the

for Tempe&s;ts and Scarcity of
Fi&s;h. It is probable one may be the
Cau&s;e of the other, whether it be that

<P>There are but Three Towns in the

chief of them is &s;ituate on a Rock which
runs out into the Sea, and is well for|tified
by Nature. It was formerly un|der

not many Years &s;ince drove out the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>

which con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of Five Hun|dred
Men, paid and officer'd by the
<HI>French</HI> King. The Officer who &s;howed
me the Palace told me, with a great deal of
Gravity, that his Ma&s;ter and the King
of <HI>France,</HI> amid&s;t all the Confu&s;ions of
<PB N="7" REF="28">
<HI>Europe,</HI> had ever been good Friends and
Allies. The Palace has hand&s;ome Apart|ments,
that are many of them hung with
Pictures of the reigning Beauties in the
Court of <HI>France.</HI> But the be&s;t of the
Furniture was at <HI>Rome,</HI> where the Prince
of <HI>Monaco</HI> re&s;ided at that time Amba&s;&s;a|dor.
We here took a little Boat to creep
along the Sea-&s;hore as far as <HI>Genoa</HI>; but
at <HI>Savona,</HI> finding the Sea too rough,
we were forced to make the be&s;t of our

much more difficult than that over
Mount <HI>Cennis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> are e&s;teemed extremely

<P>There are a great many beautiful Pa|laces
&s;tanding along the Sea-&s;hore on both
&s;ides of <HI>Genoa,</HI> which make the Town ap|pear
<PB N="9" REF="30">
much longer than it is, to tho&s;e that
fail by it. The City it &s;elf makes the noble&s;t
Show of any in the World. The Hou&s;es are
mo&s;t of them painted on the Out&s;ide; &s;o
that they look extreamly gay and lively,
be&s;ides that they are e&s;teemed the highe&s;t
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;tand very thick together.
The New-Street is a double Range
of Palaces from one end to the other,
built with an excellent Fancy, and fit
for the greate&s;t Princes to inhabit. I
cannot however be reconciled to their
manner of Painting &s;everal of the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI>
Hou&s;es. Figures, Per&s;pectives, or Pieces
of Hi&s;tory are certainly very ornamental,
as they are drawn on many of the Walls,
that would otherwi&s;e look too naked and
uniform without them: But in&s;tead of
the&s;e, one often &s;ees the Front of a Pa|lace
covered with painted Pillars of diffe|rent
Orders. If the&s;e were &s;o many true
Columns of Marble, &s;et in their proper
Architecture, they would certainly very
much adorn the Places where they &s;tand,
but as they are now, they only &s;hew us
that there is &s;omething wanting, and that
the Palace, which without the&s;e Coun|terfeit
Pillars would be beautiful in its
kind, might have been more perfect by
the Addition of &s;uch as are real. The
Front of the <HI>Villa Imperiale,</HI> at a Mile
<PB N="10" REF="31">
di&s;tance from <HI>Genoa,</HI> without any thing
of this Paint upon it, con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Doric</HI>
and <HI>Corinthian</HI> Row of Pillars, and is
much the hand&s;ome&s;t of any I there &s;aw.
The Duke of <HI>Doria</HI>'s Palace has the be&s;t
Out&s;ide of any in <HI>Genoa,</HI> as that of <HI>Du|razzo</HI>
is the be&s;t furni&s;hed within. There
is one Room in the fir&s;t, that is hung
with Tape&s;try, in which are wrought the
Figures of the great Per&s;ons, that the Fa|mily
has produced; as perhaps there is
no Hou&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> that can &s;how a lon|ger
Line of Heroes, that have &s;till acted
for the Good of their Country. <HI>Andrew
Doria</HI> has a Statue erected to him at the
Entrance of the Doge's Palace, with the
glorious Title of Deliverer of the Com|mon-wealth;
and one of his Family ano|ther,
that calls him its Pre&s;erver. In the
Doge's Palace, are the Rooms, where the
great and little Council with the Two
Colleges hold their A&s;&s;emblies; but as
the State of <HI>Genoa</HI> is very poor, tho' &s;e|veral
of its Members are extreamly rich,
&s;o one may ob&s;erve infinitely more Splen|dor
and Magnificence, in particular Per|&s;ons
Hou&s;es, than in tho&s;e that belong
to the Publick. But we find in mo&s;t of
the States of <HI>Europe,</HI> that the People &s;how
the greate&s;t Marks of Poverty, where
<PB N="11" REF="32">
the Governors live in the greate&s;t Mag|nificence.
The Churches are very fine,
particularly that of the Annunciation,
which looks wonderfully beautiful in the
In&s;ide, all but one Corner of it being co|vered
with Statues, Gilding and Paint.
A Man would expect, in &s;o very ancient
a Town of <HI>Italy,</HI> to find &s;ome con&s;idera|ble
Antiquities; but all they have to &s;how
of this Nature is an old <HI>Ro&s;trum</HI> of a <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Ship, that &s;tands over the Door of
their Ar&s;enal. It is not above a Foot long,
and perhaps would never have been
thought the Beak of a Ship, had not it
been found in &s;o probable a Place as the
Haven. It is all of Iron, fa&s;hioned at the
End like a Boar's Head; as I have &s;een
it repre&s;ented on Medals, and on the <HI>Co|lumna
Ro&s;trata</HI> in <HI>Rome.</HI> I &s;aw at <HI>Genoa</HI>
Signior <HI>Micconi</HI>'s famous Collection of
Shells, which, as Father <HI>Buonani</HI> the Je|fuite
has &s;ince told me, is one of the be&s;t
in <HI>Italy.</HI> I know nothing more remark|able,
in the Government of <HI>Genoa,</HI> than
the Bank of St. <HI>George,</HI> made up of &s;uch
Branches of the Revenues, as have been
&s;et apart, and appropriated to the di&s;|charging
of &s;everal Sums, that have been
borrowed from private Per&s;ons, during
the Exigencies of the Common-wealth.
<PB N="12" REF="33">
Whatever Inconveniencies the State has
laboured under, they have never enter|tained
a Thought of violating the Pub|lick
Credit, or of alienating any Part of
the&s;e Revenues to other U&s;es, than to
what they have been thus a&s;&s;igned. The
Admini&s;tration of this Bank is for Life,
and partly in the Hands of the chief Ci|tizens,
which gives them a great Autho|rity
in the State, and a powerful Influ|ence
over the common people. This
Bank is generally thought the greate&s;t
Load on the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> and the Managers
of it have been repre&s;ented as a &s;econd
kind of Senate, that break the Unifor|mity
of Government, and de&s;troy, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, the Fundamental Con&s;titution
of the State. It is however very certain,
that the People reap no &s;mall Advantages
from it, as it di&s;tributes the Power a|mong
more particular Members of the
Republick, and gives the Commons a Fi|gure:
So that it is no &s;mall Check up|on
the Ari&s;tocracy, and may be one Rea|&s;on,
why the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Senate carries it with
greater Moderation towards their Sub|jects,
than the <HI>Venetian.</HI></P>
<P>It would have been well for the Re|publick
of <HI>Genoa,</HI> if &s;he had followed the
Example of her Si&s;ter of <HI>Venice,</HI> in not
<PB N="13" REF="34">
permitting her Nobles to make any Pur|cha&s;e
of Lands or Hou&s;es in the Domi|nions
of a Foreign Prince. For at pre|&s;ent
the Greate&s;t, among the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> are
in part Subjects to the Monarchy of
<HI>Spain,</HI> by rea&s;on of their E&s;tates that lye
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> The <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
Tax them very high upon occa&s;ion,
and are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Advantage this
gives them over the Republick, that
they will not &s;uffer a <HI>Neapolitan</HI> to buy
the Lands of a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> who mu&s;t find
a Purcha&s;er among his own Country|men,
if he has a Mind to &s;ell. For this
Rea&s;on, as well as on Account of the
great Sums of Mony which the <HI>Spani|ard</HI>
owes the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> they are under a
Nece&s;&s;ity, at pre&s;ent, of being in the In|tere&s;t
of the <HI>French,</HI> and would probably
continue &s;o, tho' all the other States of
<HI>Italy</HI> entered into a League again&s;t them.
<HI>Genoa</HI> is not yet &s;ecure from a Bombard|ment,
tho' it is not &s;o expo&s;ed as former|ly;
for, &s;ince the In&s;ult of the <HI>French,</HI>
they have built a Mole, with &s;ome little
Ports, and have provided them&s;elves with
long Guns and Mortars. It is ea&s;ie for
tho&s;e that are &s;trong at Sea to bring them
to what Terms they pleafe; for having but
very little Arable Land, they are forced to
<PB N="14" REF="35">
fetch all their Corn from <HI>Naples, Sicily,</HI>
and other Foreign Countries; except
what comes to them from <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
which probably goes another way,
whil&s;t it furni&s;hes Two great Armies
with Provi&s;ions. Their Fleet, that for|merly
gained &s;o many Victories over the
<HI>Saracens, Pi&s;ans, Venetians, Turks</HI> and <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
that made them Ma&s;ters of <HI>Crete,</HI>
<HI>Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca, Negrepont,</HI>
<HI>Lesbos, Malta,</HI> that &s;ettled them in <HI>Scio,</HI>
<HI>Smyrna, Achaia, Theodo&s;ia,</HI> and &s;everal
Towns on the Ea&s;tern Confines of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
is now reduced to Six Gallies. When
they had made an Addition of but Four
new ones, the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent his
Orders to &s;uppre&s;s them, telling the Re|publick
at the &s;ame time, that he knew
very well how many they had Occa&s;ion
for. This little Fleet &s;erves only to fetch
them Wine and Corn, and to give their
Ladies an Airing in the Summer-&s;ea&s;on.
The Republick of <HI>Genoa</HI> has a Crown
and Scepter for its Doge, by rea&s;on of
their Conque&s;t of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> where there
was formerly a <HI>Saracen</HI> King. This in|deed
gives their Amba&s;&s;adors a more ho|nourable
Reception at &s;ome Courts, but,
at the &s;ame time, may teach their Peo|ple
to have a mean Notion of their own
<PB N="15" REF="36">
Form of Government, and is a tacit Ac|knowledgment
that Monarchy is the
more honourable. The old <HI>Romans,</HI> on
the contrary, made u&s;e of a very barba|rous
kind of Politicks to in&s;pire their
People with a Contempt of Kings, whom
they treated with Infamy, and dragged
at the Wheels of their Triumphal Cha|riots.</P>

<P>A Poet of another Nation would not
have dwelt &s;o long upon the Clearne&s;s
and Tran&s;parency of the Stream, but in
<HI>Italy</HI> one &s;eldom &s;ees a River that is ex|treamly
bright and limpid, mo&s;t of them
falling down from the Mountains, that
make their Waters very troubled and
muddy, whereas the <HI>Te&s;in</HI> is only an Out|let
of that va&s;t Lake, which the <HI>Italians</HI>
now call the <HI>Lago Maggiore.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw between <HI>Pavia</HI> and <HI>Milan</HI> the
Convent of <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> which is very &s;pa|cious
and beautiful. Their Church is
extreamly fine, and curiou&s;ly adorned,
but of a <HI>Gothic</HI> Structure.</P>
<P>I could not &s;tay long in <HI>Milan</HI> with|out
going to &s;ee the Great Church that
<PB N="21" REF="42">
I had heard &s;o much of, but was never
more deceived in my Expectation than
at my fir&s;t entering: For the Front,
which was all I had &s;een of the Out&s;ide,
is not half fini&s;hed, and the In&s;ide is &s;o
&s;mutted with Du&s;t, and the Smoak of
Lamps, that neither the Marble, nor
the Silver, nor Bra&s;s-Works &s;how them|&s;elves
to an Advantage. This va&s;t <HI>Gothic</HI>
Pile of Building is all of Marble, except
the Roof, which would have been of the
&s;ame Matter with the re&s;t, had not its
Weight rendered it improper for that
part of the Building. But for the Rea|&s;on
I have ju&s;t now mentioned, the Out|&s;ide
of the Church looks much whiter
and fre&s;her than the In&s;ide; for where
the Marble is &s;o often wa&s;hed with Rains,
it pre&s;erves it &s;elf more beautiful and un|&s;ullyed,
than in tho&s;e Parts that are not
at all expo&s;ed to the Weather. That
Side of the Church indeed, which faces
the Tramontane Wind, is much more
un&s;ightly than the re&s;t, by rea&s;on of the
Du&s;t and Smoak that are driven again&s;t
it. This Profu&s;ion of Marble, tho' a&s;to|ni&s;hing
to Strangers, is not very won|derful
in a Country that has &s;o many
Veins of it within its Bowels. But tho'
the Stones are cheap, the working of
them is very expen&s;ive. It is generally
<PB N="22" REF="43">
&s;aid there are Eleven Thou&s;and Statues
about the Church, but they reckon in|to
the Account every particular Figure
in the Hi&s;tory-pieces, and &s;everal little
Images which make up the Equipage of
tho&s;e that are larger. There are indeed a
great Multitude of &s;uch as are bigger
than the Life: I reckoned above Two
Hundred and Fifty on the Out&s;ide of
the Church, tho' I only told Three Sides
of it; and the&s;e are not half &s;o thick
&s;et as they intend them. The Statues are
all of Marble, and generally well cut; but
the mo&s;t valuable one they have is a
St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> new-flead, with his Skin
hanging over his Shoulders: It is e&s;teemed
worth its weight in Gold: They have
in&s;cribed this Ver&s;e on the Pede&s;tal, to
&s;how the Value they have for the Work|man.</P>

<P>There is, ju&s;t before the Entrance of
the Quire, a little Subterraneous Chap|pel,
Dedicated to St. <HI>Charles Borromee,</HI>
where I &s;aw his Body, in Epi&s;copal
Robes, lying upon the Altar in a Shrine
<PB N="23" REF="44">
of Rock-Cry&s;tal. His Chappel is adorned
with abundance of Silver Work: He
was but Two and Twenty Years old
when he was cho&s;en Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mi|lan,</HI>
and Forty Six at his Death; but
made &s;o good u&s;e of &s;o &s;hort a time, by
his Works of Charity and Munificence,
that his Countrymen ble&s;s his Memory,
which is &s;till fre&s;h among them. He was
Cannoni&s;ed about a Hundred Years ago:
and indeed if this Honour were due to
any Man, I think &s;uch Publick-&s;pirited
Virtues may lay a ju&s;ter Claim to it, than
a &s;our Retreat from Mankind, a fiery
Zeal again&s;t <HI>Heterodoxies,</HI> a Set of Chi|merical
Vi&s;ions, or of Whim&s;ical Pe|nances,
which are generally the Qualifica|tions
of <HI>Roman</HI> Saints. Miracles indeed
are required of all who a&s;pire to this Dig|nity,
becau&s;e they &s;ay an Hypocrite may
imitate a Saint in all other Particulars,
and the&s;e they attribute in great Num|ber,
to him I am &s;peaking of. His Me|rit,
and the Importunity of his Country|men,
procured his Canonization before
the ordinary time; for it is the Policy of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church not to allow this Ho|nour,
ordinarily, 'till Fifty Years after
the Death of the Per&s;on, who is a Candi|date
for it; in which time it may be &s;up|po&s;ed
that all his Contemporaries will be
<PB N="24" REF="45">
worn out, who could contradict a pre|tended
Miracle, or remember any Infir|mity
of the Saint. One would wonder
that <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who are for this
kind of Wor&s;hip, do not generally ad|dre&s;s
them&s;elves to the Holy Apo&s;tles,
who have a more unque&s;tionable Right
to the Title of Saints than tho&s;e of a
Modern Date; but the&s;e are at pre&s;ent
quite out of Fa&s;hion in <HI>Italy,</HI> where
there is &s;carce a great Town, which does
not pay its Devotions, in a more particu|lar
manner, to &s;ome one of their own
making. This renders it very &s;u&s;picious,
that the Intere&s;ts of Particular Families,
Religious Orders, Convents or Churches,
have too great a Sway in their Canoni|zations.
When I was at <HI>Milan</HI> I &s;aw a
Book newly publi&s;hed, that was Dedica|ted
to the pre&s;ent Head of the <HI>Borromean</HI>
Family, and entitled, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e on the
Humility of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and of St.</HI> Charles
Borromee.</P>
<P>The Great Church of <HI>Milan</HI> has Two
Noble Pulpits of Bra&s;s, each of them run|ning
round a large Pillar, like a Gallery,
and &s;upported by huge Figures of the
&s;ame Metal. The Hi&s;tory of our Savi|our,
or rather of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin,
for it begins with her Birth, and ends
with her Coronation in Heaven, that of
<PB N="25" REF="46">
our Saviour coming in by way of <HI>Epi&s;ode</HI>)
is finely cut in Marble by <HI>Andrew Biffy.</HI>
This Church is very Rich in Relicks,
which run up as high as <HI>Daniel, Jonas</HI>
and <HI>Abraham.</HI> Among the re&s;t they &s;how
a Fragment of our Countryman <HI>Becket,</HI>
as indeed there are very few Trea&s;uries
of Relicks in <HI>Italy</HI> that have not a Tooth
or a Bone of this Saint. It would be end|le&s;s
to count up the Riches of Silver,
Gold, and Precious Stones, that are
ama&s;s'd together in this and &s;everal other
Churches of <HI>Milan.</HI> I was told, that in
<HI>Milan</HI> there are Sixty Convents of Wo|men,
Eighty of Men, and Two Hun|dred
Churches. At the <HI>Cele&s;tines</HI> is a
Picture in Fre&s;co of the Marriage of
<HI>Cana,</HI> very much e&s;teem'd; but the
Painter, whether de&s;ignedly or not, has
put Six Fingers to the Hand of one of
the Figures: They &s;how the Gates of
a Church that St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> &s;hut again&s;t
the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> as thinking him
unfit to a&s;&s;i&s;t at Divine Service, 'till he
had done &s;ome extraordinary Penance
for his barbarous Ma&s;&s;acring the Inha|bitants
of <HI>The&s;&s;alonica.</HI> That Emperor
was however &s;o far from being di&s;pleas'd
with the Behaviour of the Saint, that
at his Death he committed to him the
Education of his Children. Several have
<PB N="26" REF="47">
pick'd Splinters of Wood out of the
Gates for Relicks. There is a little Chap|pel
lately re-edify'd, where the &s;ame
Saint baptis'd St. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI> An In&s;cription
upon the Wall of it &s;ays, that it was in
this Chappel, and on this Occa&s;ion, that
he fir&s;t &s;ung his <HI>Te Deum,</HI> and that his
great Convert an&s;wered him Ver&s;e by
Ver&s;e. In one of the Churches I &s;aw
a Pulpit and Confe&s;&s;ional, very finely In|laid
with <HI>Lapis-Lazuli,</HI> and &s;everal kinds
of Marble, by a Father of the Convent.
It is very lucky for a Religious, who has
&s;o much Time on his Hands, to be
able to amu&s;e him&s;elf with Works of
this Nature; and one often finds parti|cular
Members of Convents, who have
excellent Mechanical Genius's, and di|vert
them&s;elves, at lei&s;ure Hours, with
Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Gar|dening,
and &s;everal kinds of Handy-Crafts.
Since I have mention'd Con|fe&s;&s;ionals,
I &s;hall &s;et down here &s;ome In|&s;criptions
that I have &s;een over them in
<HI>Roman</HI>-Catholick Countries, which are
all Texts of Scripture, and regard either
the Penitent or the Father. <HI>Abi, O&s;ten|de

I &s;aw the <HI>Ambro&s;ian</HI> Library,
where, to &s;how the <HI>Italian</HI> Genius, they
have &s;pent more Money on Pictures than

learned Men I met with no <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI>
except Bi&s;hop <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> whom <HI>Henry</HI> the
Eighth put to Death for not owning his

part of the Furniture that one ordinarily
goes to &s;ee in an <HI>Italian</HI> Library, which
they generally &s;et off with Pictures, Sta|tues,
and other Ornaments, where they
can afford them, after the Example of
the old <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI><Q><L>&mdash;Plena omnia gyp&s;o</L>

<P>In an Apartment behind the Library
are &s;everal Rarities often de&s;cribed

Manu&s;cript in <HI>Latin</HI> of <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> which
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury</HI> &s;ays was written
about the Age of <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> and another
of <HI>Leonardus Vincius,</HI> which King <HI>James</HI>
the Fir&s;t could not procure, tho' he
proffered for it Three Thou&s;and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Pi&s;tols. It con&s;i&s;ts of De&s;ignings in Me|chani&s;m
and Engineering: I was &s;hown
in it a Sketch of Bombs and Mortars, as
they are now u&s;ed. Canon <HI>Settala</HI>'s Ca|binet
is always &s;hown to a Stranger a|mong
the Curio&s;ities of <HI>Milan,</HI> which I
&s;hall not be particular upon, the Print|ed
Account of it being common enough.
Among its Natural Curio&s;ities I took
particular notice of a Piece of Chry&s;tal,
that enclos'd a couple of Drops, which
look'd like Water when they were &s;ha|ken,
tho' perhaps they are nothing but
Bubbles of Air. It is &s;uch a Rarity as
this that I &s;aw at <HI>Vendome</HI> in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="50">
which they there pretend is a Tear that
our Saviour &s;hed over <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and was
gather'd up by an Angel, who put it
in a little Chry&s;tal Vial, and made a Pre|&s;ent
of it to <HI>Mary Magdalene.</HI> The
Famous <HI>Pere Mabillon</HI> is now engag'd in
the Vindication of this Tear, which a
learned Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, in the Neighbour|hood
of <HI>Vendome,</HI> would have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
as a fal&s;e and ridiculous Relick, in
a Book that he has Dedicated to
his Dioce&s;an the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Blois.</HI> It is
in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Benedictin</HI> Convent,
which rai&s;es a con&s;iderable Revenue out
of the Devotion that is paid to it, and
has now retained the mo&s;t learned Father
of their Order to write in its Defence.</P>
<P>It was &s;uch a Curio&s;ity as this I have
mention'd, that <HI>Claudian</HI> has celebrated
in about half a Score Epigrams.<Q><L>Solibus indomitum glacies Alpina rigorem</L>

The Citadel of <HI>Milan</HI> is thought a
&s;trong Fort in <HI>Italy,</HI> and has held out
formerly after the Conque&s;t of the
re&s;t of the Dutchy. The Governor of it
is independent on the Governor of <HI>Mi|lan</HI>;
as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;ed to make the
Rulers of Provinces and Fortre&s;&s;es of
different Conditions and Intere&s;ts, to pre|vent
Con&s;piracies.</P>
<P>At Two Miles di&s;tance from <HI>Milan</HI>
there &s;tands a Building, that would have
been a Ma&s;ter-piece in its kind, had the
Architect de&s;ign'd it for an Artificial
Echo. We di&s;charg'd a Pi&s;tol, and had
the Sound return'd upon us above Fifty
Six times, tho' the Air was very foggy.
The fir&s;t Repetitions follow one ano|ther
very thick, but are heard more di|&s;tinctly
in proportion as they decay:
There are Two parallel Walls which beat
the Sound back on each other, 'till the
Undulation is quite worn out, like the
&s;everal Reverberations of the &s;ame Image
from two oppo&s;ite Looking-Gla&s;&s;es.
Father <HI>Kircher</HI> has taken notice of this
particular Echo, as Father <HI>Bartolin</HI> has
done &s;ince in his Ingenious Di&s;cour&s;e on
Sounds. The State of <HI>Milan</HI> is like a
va&s;t Garden, &s;urrounded by a Noble
Mound-Work of Rocks and Mountains:
Indeed if a Man con&s;iders the Face of
<PB N="33" REF="54">
<HI>Italy</HI> in general, one would think that
Nature had laid it out into &s;uch a Varie|ty
of States and Governments as one
finds in it. For as the <HI>Alpes</HI> at one End,
and the long Range of <HI>Appenines,</HI> that
pa&s;&s;es thro' the Body of it, branch out
on all &s;ides into &s;everal different Divi&s;i|ons;
they &s;erve as &s;o many natural Boun|daries
and Fortifications to the little Ter|ritories
that lye among them. Accor|dingly
we find the whole Country cut
into a Multitude of particular King|doms
and Common-wealths in the olde&s;t
Accounts we have of it, 'till the Power
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> like a Torrent that o|verflows
its Banks, bore down all before
it, and &s;pread it &s;elf into the remote&s;t
Corners of the Nation. But as this Ex|orbitant
Power became unable to &s;up|port
it &s;elf, we find the Government of
<HI>Italy</HI> again broken into &s;uch a Variety
of Sub-Divi&s;ions, as naturally &s;uits with
its Situation.</P>
<P>In the Court of <HI>Milan,</HI> as in &s;everal
others of <HI>Italy,</HI> there are many who fall
in with the Dre&s;s and Carriage of the
<HI>French.</HI> One may however ob&s;erve a kind
of Awkwardne&s;s in the <HI>Italians,</HI> which ea|&s;ily
di&s;covers the Airs they give them|&s;elves
not to be natural. It is indeed
very &s;trange there &s;hould be &s;uch a
<PB N="34" REF="55">
Diver&s;ity of Manners, where there is
&s;o &s;mall a difference in the Air and Cli|mate.
The <HI>French</HI> are always Open,
Familiar and Talkative: The <HI>Italians,</HI>
on the contrary, are Stiff, Ceremonious
and Re&s;erved. In <HI>France</HI> every one
aims at a Gaiety and Sprightline&s;s of Be|haviour,
and thinks it an Accompli&s;h|ment
to be brisk and lively: The <HI>Itali|ans,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding their natural Fieri|ne&s;s
of Temper, affect always to appear
Sober and Sedate; in&s;omuch that one
&s;ometimes meets Young Men walking
the Streets with Spectacles on their
No&s;es, that they may be thought to
have impaired their Sight by much
Study, and &s;eem more Grave and Judi|cious
than their Neighbours. This Dif|ference
of Manners proceeds chiefly
from Difference of Education: In <HI>France</HI>
it is u&s;ual to bring their Children into
Company, and to cheri&s;h in them, from
their Infancy, a kind of Forwardne&s;s
and A&s;&s;urance: Be&s;ides, that the <HI>French</HI>
apply them&s;elves more univer&s;ally to their
Exerci&s;es than any other Nation in the
World, &s;o that one &s;eldom &s;ees a Young
Gentleman in <HI>France</HI> that does not Fence,
Dance, and Ride in &s;ome tolerable Per|fection.
The&s;e Agitations of the Body
do not only give them a free and ea&s;ie
<PB N="35" REF="56">
Carriage, but have a kind of Mechani|cal
Operation on the Mind, by keeping
the Animal Spirits always awake and in
Motion. But what contributes mo&s;t
to this light airy Humour of the <HI>French,</HI>
is the Free Conver&s;ation that is allowed
them with their Women, which does
not only communicate to them a certain
Vivacity of Temper, but makes them
endeavour after &s;uch a Behaviour as is
mo&s;t taking with the Sex.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians,</HI> on the contrary, who are
excluded from making their Court this
way, are for recommending them&s;elves
to tho&s;e they Conver&s;e with by their
Gravity and Wi&s;dom. In <HI>Spain</HI> there|fore,
where there are fewer Liberties
of this Nature allowed, there is &s;ome|thing
&s;till more &s;erious and compo&s;ed in
the manner of the Inhabitants. But
as Mirth is more apt to make Pro&s;elytes
than Melancholy, it is ob&s;erved that the
<HI>Italians</HI> have many of them for the&s;e late
Years given very far into the Modes
and Freedoms of the <HI>French</HI>; which pre|vail
more or le&s;s in the Courts of <HI>Italy,</HI>
as they lye at a &s;maller or greater Di|&s;tance
from <HI>France.</HI> It may be here
worth while to con&s;ider how it comes
to pa&s;s, that the Common People of <HI>Ita|ly</HI>
have in general &s;o very great an Aver&s;ion
<PB N="36" REF="57">
to the <HI>French,</HI> which every Traveller
cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of, that has pa&s;|&s;ed
thro' the Country. The mo&s;t obvi|ous
Rea&s;on is certainly the great Diffe|rence
that there is in the Humours and
Manners of the Two Nations, which
always works more in the meaner
&s;ort, who are not able to vanqui&s;h the
Prejudices of Education, than with the
Nobility. Be&s;ides, that the <HI>French</HI> Hu|mour,
in regard of the Liberties they
take in Female Conver&s;ations, and their
great Ambition to Excel in all Compa|nies,
is in a more particular manner very
&s;hocking to the <HI>Italians,</HI> who are natu|rally
Jealous, and value them&s;elves upon
their great Wi&s;dom. At the &s;ame time
the common People of <HI>Italy,</HI> who run
more into News and Politicks than tho&s;e
of other Countries, have all of them

<P>_FROM <HI>Milan</HI> we travell'd
thro' a very plea&s;ant Country,
to <HI>Bre&s;cia,</HI> and by the way
cro&s;s'd the River <HI>Adda,</HI> that
falls into the <HI>Lago di Como,</HI>
which <HI>Virgil</HI> calls the Lake <HI>Larius,</HI> and
running out at the other End lo&s;es it &s;elf
at la&s;t in the <HI>Po,</HI> which is the great Re|ceptacle
of all the Rivers of this Coun|try.
The Town and Province of <HI>Bre|&s;cia</HI>
have freer Acce&s;s to the Senate of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and a quicker Redre&s;s of Injuries,
than any other Part of their Dominions.
They have always a mild and prudent
Governor, and live much more happily
than their Fellow-Subjects: For as they
were once a Part of the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> and
are now on their Frontiers, the <HI>Veneti|ans</HI>
dare not exa&s;perate them, by the
<PB N="41" REF="62">
Loads they lay on other Provinces, for
fear of a Revolt; and are forc'd to Treat
them with much more Indulgence than
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do their Neighbours, that
they may have no Temptation to it.
<HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> is famous for its Iron-Works.
A &s;mall Day's Journey more brought us
to <HI>Verona.</HI> We &s;aw the Lake <HI>Benacus</HI>
in our way, which the <HI>Italians</HI> now call

<P>There are &s;ome other Antiquities in
<HI>Verona,</HI> of which the Principal is the
Ruin of a Triumphal Arch erected to
<HI>Flaminius,</HI> where one &s;ees old <HI>Doric</HI> Pil|lars
without any Pede&s;tal or Ba&s;is, as <HI>Vi|truvius</HI>
has de&s;cribed them. I have not
yet &s;een any Gardens in <HI>Italy</HI> worth ta|king
notice of. The <HI>Italians</HI> fall as far
&s;hort of the <HI>French</HI> in this Particular, as
they excel them in their Palaces. It
mu&s;t however be &s;aid, to the Honour
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> took from
them the fir&s;t Plans of their Gardens, as
well as of their Water-Works; &s;o that
their &s;urpa&s;&s;ing of them at pre&s;ent is to
be attributed rather to the Greatne&s;s of
their Riches, than the Excellence of
their Ta&s;te. I &s;aw the Terrace-Garden
of <HI>Verona,</HI> that Travellers gene|rally
mention. Among the Churches of
<HI>Verona,</HI> that of St. <HI>George</HI> is the hand|&s;ome&s;t:
Its chief Ornament is the Mar|tyrdom
of the Saint, drawn by <HI>Paul
Verone&s;e</HI>; as there are many other Pi|ctures
about the Town by the &s;ame
Hand. A Stranger is always &s;hown the
Tomb of Pope <HI>Lucius,</HI> who lyes buried
in the Dome. I &s;aw in the &s;ame Church
<PB N="46" REF="67">
a Monument erected by the Publick to
one of their Bi&s;hops: The In&s;cription
&s;ays, that there was between him and
his Maker, <HI>Summa Nece&s;&s;itudo, Summa
Similitudo.</HI> The <HI>Italian</HI> Epitaphs are
often more extravagant than tho&s;e of o|ther
Countries, as the Nation is more
given to Compliment and Hyperbole.
From <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Padua</HI> we travelled thro'
a very plea&s;ant Country: It is planted
thick with Rows of White Mulberry-trees,
that furni&s;h Food for great Quan|tities
of Silk-worms with their Leaves,
as the Swine and Poultry con&s;ume the
Fruit. The Trees them&s;elves &s;erve, at
the &s;ame time, as &s;o many Stays for their
Vines, which hang all along like Garlands
from Tree to Tree. Between the &s;eve|ral
Ranges lye Fields of Corn, which in
the&s;e warm Countries ripens much bet|ter
among the Mulberry Shades, than if
it were expo&s;ed to the open Sun. This
was one Rea&s;on why the Inhabitants of
this Country, when I pa&s;&s;ed thro' it,
were extreamly apprehen&s;ive of &s;eeing
<HI>Lombardy</HI> the Seat of War, which mu&s;t
have made mi&s;erable Havock among
their Plantations; for it is not here as in
the Corn Fields of <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the
whole Product of the Place ri&s;es from
Year to Year. We arrived &s;o late at <HI>Vi|cenza,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="68">
that we had not time to take a
full Sight of the Place. The next Day
brought us to <HI>Padua.</HI> St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who
lived about Five Hundred Years ago, is
the great Saint to whom they here pay
their Devotions. He lyes buried in the
Church that is Dedicated to him at pre|&s;ent,
tho' it was formerly Con&s;ecrated
to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. It is extreamly
magnificent, and very richly adorned.
There are narrow Clefts in the Monu|ment
that &s;tands over him, where good
Catholicks rub their Beads, and &s;mell
his Bones, which they &s;ay have in them
a natural Perfume, tho' very like Apo|plectic
Bal&s;om; and what would make
one &s;u&s;pect that they rub the Marble
with it, it is ob&s;erved that the Scent is
&s;tronger in the Morning than at Night.
There are abundance of In&s;criptions and
Pictures hung up by his Votaries in &s;e|veral
Parts of the Church: For it is the
way of tho&s;e that are in any Signal Dan|ger
to implore his Aid, and if they come
off &s;afe they call their Deliverance a Mi|racle,
and perhaps hang up the Picture
or De&s;cription of it in the Church. This
Cu&s;tom &s;poils the Beauty of &s;everal <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Catholick Churches, and often co|vers
the Walls with wretched Daub|ings,
impertinent In&s;criptions, Hands,
<PB N="48" REF="69">
Legs, and Arms of Wax, with a Thou|&s;and
idle Offerings of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>They &s;ell at <HI>Padua</HI> the Life of St.
<HI>Anthony,</HI> which is read with great De|votion;
the mo&s;t remarkable Part of it
is his Di&s;cour&s;e to an A&s;&s;embly of Fi&s;h.

<HEAD>VENICE.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving often heard <HI>Venice</HI> re|pre&s;ented
as one of the mo&s;t
defen&s;ible Cities in the
World, I took Care to in|form
my &s;elf of the Particu|lars
in which its Strength con&s;i&s;ts. And
the&s;e I find are chiefly owing to its ad|vantagious
Situation; for it has neither
Rocks nor Fortifications near it, and yet
is, perhaps, the mo&s;t impregnable Town
in <HI>Europe.</HI> It &s;tands at lea&s;t Four Miles
from any part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> nor are
the Shallows that lye about it, ever
frozen hard enough to bring over an Ar|my
from the Land-&s;ide. The con&s;tant
Flux and Reflux of the Sea, or the na|tural
Mildne&s;s of the Climate, hindering
the Ice from gathering to any Thick|ne&s;s;
which is an Advantage the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
want, when they have laid all
their Country under Water. On the
Side that is expo&s;ed to the Adriatic, the
Entrance is &s;o difficult to hit, that they
have marked it out with &s;everal Stakes
driven into the Ground, which they
<PB N="62" REF="83">
would not fail to cut upon the fir&s;t ap|proach
of an Enemy's Fleet. For this
Rea&s;on they have not fortified the little
I&s;lands, that lye at the Entrance, to the
be&s;t Advantage, which might otherwi&s;e
very ea&s;ily command all the Pa&s;&s;es that
lead to the City from the Adriatic. Nor
could an ordinary Fleet, with Bomb-Ve&s;|&s;els,
hope to &s;ucceed again&s;t a Place that
has always in its Ar&s;enal a con&s;iderable
Number of Gallies and Men of War rea|dy
to put to Sea on a very &s;hort warning.
If we could therefore &s;uppo&s;e them block|ed
up on all &s;ides, by a Power too &s;trong for
them, both by Sea and Land, they would
be able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t every
thing but Famine; and this would not
be a little mitigated by the great Quan|tities
of Fi&s;h that their Seas abound with,
and that may be taken up in the mid&s;t
of their very Streets, which is &s;uch a
natural Magazine as few other Places
can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Our Voyage-Writers will needs have
this City in great Danger of being left,
within an Age or two, on the <HI>Terra
Firma</HI>; and repre&s;ent it in &s;uch a man|ner,
as if the Sea was in&s;en&s;ibly &s;hrink|ing
from it, and retiring into its Chan|nel.
I asked &s;everal, and among the re&s;t
Father <HI>Coronelli,</HI> the State's Geographer,
<PB N="63" REF="84">
of the Truth of this Particular, and they
all a&s;&s;ured me that the Sea ri&s;es as high
as ever, tho' the great Heaps of Dirt
it brings along with it are apt to
choak up the Shallows, but that they
are in no Danger of lo&s;ing the Benefit
of their Situation, &s;o long as they are at
the Charge of removing the&s;e Banks of
Mud and Sand. One may &s;ee abun|dance
of them above the Surface of the
Water, &s;cattered up and down like &s;o
many little I&s;lands, when the Tide is
low; and they are the&s;e that make the
Entrance for Ships difficult to &s;uch as
are not u&s;ed to them, for the deep Ca|nals
run between them, which the <HI>Ve|netians</HI>
are at a great Expence to keep
free and open.</P>
<P>This City &s;tands very convenient for
Commerce. It has &s;everal Navigable
Rivers that run up into the Body of <HI>I|taly,</HI>
by which they might &s;upply a great
many Countries with Fi&s;h and other
Commodities; not to mention their Op|portunities
for the <HI>Levant,</HI> and each &s;ide
of the Adriatic. But, notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e Conveniencies, their Trade is far
from being in a flouri&s;hing Condition for
many Rea&s;ons. The Duties are great that
are laid on Merchandi&s;es. Their Nobles
think it below their Quality to engage
<PB N="64" REF="85">
in Traffick. The Merchants who are
grown Rich, and able to manage great
Dealings, buy their Nobility, and ge|nerally
give over Trade. Their Manu|factures
of Cloth, Gla&s;s and Silk, for|merly
the be&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> are now ex|celled
by tho&s;e of other Countries. They
are tenacious of old Laws and Cu&s;toms
to their great Prejudice, whereas a Tra|ding
Nation mu&s;t be &s;till for new Chan|ges
and Expedients, as different Jun|ctures
and Emergencies ari&s;e. The State
is at pre&s;ent very &s;en&s;ible of this Decay
in their Trade, and as a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI>
who is &s;till a Merchant, told me, they
will &s;peedily find out &s;ome Method to
redre&s;s it; po&s;&s;ibly by making a free
Port, for they look with an Evil Eye
upon <HI>Leghorne,</HI> which draws to it mo&s;t of
the Ve&s;&s;els bound for <HI>Italy.</HI> They have
hitherto been &s;o negligent in this Parti|cular,
that many think the Great Duke's
Gold has had no &s;mall Influence in their
Councils.</P>
<P><HI>Venice</HI> has &s;everal Particulars which
are not to be found in other Cities, and
is therefore very entertaining to a Tra|veller.
It looks, at a di&s;tance, like a great
Town half floated by a Deluge. There
are Canals every where cro&s;&s;ing it, &s;o
that one may go to mo&s;t Hou&s;es either
<PB N="65" REF="86">
by Land or Water. This is a very great
Convenience to the Inhabitants; for a
<HI>Gondola</HI> with Two Oars at <HI>Venice,</HI> is as
magnificent as a Coach and Six Hor&s;es,
with a large Equipage, in another Coun|try;
be&s;ides that it makes all Carriages
extreamly cheap. The Streets are gene|rally
Paved with Brick or Free-&s;tone,
and always kept very neat, for there is
no Carriage, not &s;o much as a Chair,
that pa&s;&s;es thro' them. There is an in|numerable
Multitude of very hand&s;ome
Bridges, all of a &s;ingle Arch, and with|out
any Fence on either &s;ide, which
would be a great Inconvenience to a
City le&s;s &s;ober than <HI>Venice.</HI> One would
indeed wonder that Drinking is &s;o little
in Vogue among the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who are
in a moi&s;t Air and a moderate Climate,
and have no &s;uch Diver&s;ions as Bowling,
Hunting, Walking, Riding, and the
like Exerci&s;es to employ them without
Doors. But as the Nobles are not to
Conver&s;e too much with Strangers, they
are in no Danger of learning it; and
they are generally too di&s;tru&s;tful of one
another for the Freedoms that are u&s;ed
in &s;uch kind of Conver&s;ations. There
are many Noble Palaces in <HI>Venice.</HI> Their
Furniture is not commonly very Rich,
if we except the Pictures, which are
<PB N="66" REF="87">
here in greater plenty than in any other
Place in <HI>Europe,</HI> from the Hands of the
be&s;t Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Lombard</HI> School; as
<HI>Titian, Paul Verone&s;e</HI> and <HI>Tintoret.</HI> The
la&s;t of the&s;e is in greater E&s;teem at <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
than in other Parts of <HI>Italy.</HI> The
Rooms are generally hung with Gilt
Leather, which they cover on extraor|dinary
Occa&s;ions with Tape&s;try, and
Hangings of greater Value. The Floor|ing
is a kind of Red Plai&s;ter made of
Brick ground to Powder, and afterwards
work'd into Mortar. It is rubbed with
Oil, and makes a &s;mooth, &s;hining and
beautiful Surface. The&s;e Particularities
are chiefly owing to the Moi&s;ture of the
Air, which would have an ill Effect on
other kinds of Furniture, as it &s;hows it
&s;elf too vi&s;ibly in many of their fine&s;t
Pictures. Tho' the <HI>Venetians</HI> are ex|treamly
jealous of any great Fame or
Merit in a living Member of their Com|mon-wealth,
they never fail of giving a
Man his due Pari&s;es, when they are in
no Danger of &s;uffering from his Ambi|tion.
For this Rea&s;on, tho' there are a
great many Monuments erected to &s;uch
as have been Benefactors to the Repub|lick,
they are generally put up after their
Deaths. Among the many Elogiums
that are given to the Doge <HI>Pi&s;auro,</HI> who
<PB N="67" REF="88">
had been Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>England,</HI> his E|pitaph
&s;ays, <HI>In Angli&acirc; Jacobi Regis obi|tum
mir&acirc; calliditate celatum mir&acirc; &s;agacita|te
rimatus pri&s;cam benevolentiam firmavit.</HI>
The particular Palaces, Churches, and
Pictures of <HI>Venice,</HI> are enumerated in &s;e|veral
little Books that may be bought on
the Place, and have been faithfully
Tran&s;cribed by many Voyage-Writers.
When I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> they were putting
out very curious Stamps of the &s;everal
Edifices which are mo&s;t famous for their
Beauty or Magnificence. The <HI>Ar&s;enal</HI>
of <HI>Venice</HI> is an I&s;land of about three Miles
round. It contains all the Stores and
Provi&s;ions for War, that are not actu|ally
employed. There are Docks for
their Gallies and Men of War, mo&s;t of
them full, as well as Work-Hou&s;es for
all Land and Naval Preparations. That
Part of it, where the Arms are laid,
makes a great &s;how, and was indeed very
extraordinary about a Hundred Years
ago, but at pre&s;ent a great part of its
Furniture is grown u&s;ele&s;s. There &s;eem
to be almo&s;t as many Suits of Armour as
there are Guns. The Swords are old-fa&s;hion'd
and unwieldy in a very great
Number, and the Fire-Arms fitted with
Locks of little Convenience in compa|ri&s;on
of tho&s;e that are now in u&s;e. The
<PB N="68" REF="89">
<HI>Venetians</HI> pretend they could &s;et out, in
Ca&s;e of great Nece&s;&s;ity, Thirty Men of
War, a Hundred Gallies, and Ten Ga|lea&s;&s;es,
tho' I cannot conceive how they
could Man a Fleet of half the number.
It was certainly a mighty Error in this
State to affect &s;o many Conque&s;ts on the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> which has only &s;erved to
rai&s;e the Jealou&s;ie of the Chri&s;tian Prin|ces,
and about Three Hundred Years
ago had like to have ended in the utter
Extirpation of the Common-wealth;
whereas, had they applyed them&s;elves
with the &s;ame Politics and Indu&s;try to
the Increa&s;e of their Strength by Sea,
they might perhaps have had all the
I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> in their Hands,
and, by Con&s;equence, the greate&s;t Fleet,
and the mo&s;t Sea-men of any other State
in <HI>Europe.</HI> Be&s;ides, that this would have
given no Jealou&s;ie to the Princes their
Neighbours, who would have enjoyed
their own Dominions in Peace, and
have been very well contented to have
&s;een &s;o &s;trong a Bulwark again&s;t all the
Forces and Inva&s;ions of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em|pire.</P>
<P>This Republick has been much more
powerful than it is at pre&s;ent, as it is &s;till
likelier to &s;ink than increa&s;e in its Domini|ons.
It is not impo&s;&s;ible but the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="90">
may, &s;ome time or other, demand of them
<HI>Creme, Bre&s;cia,</HI> and <HI>Bergame,</HI> which have
been torn from the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI>; and in ca&s;e
a War &s;hould ari&s;e upon it, and the <HI>Ve|netians</HI>
lo&s;e a &s;ingle Battel, they might
be beaten off the Continent in a &s;ingle
Summer, for their Fortifications are ve|ry
Incon&s;iderable. On the other &s;ide,
the <HI>Venetians</HI> are in continual Apprehen|&s;ions
from the <HI>Turk,</HI> who will certainly
endeavour at the Recovery of the <HI>Mo|rea,</HI>
as &s;oon as the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire has
recruited a little of its antient Strength.
They are very &s;en&s;ible that they had
better have pu&s;hed their Conque&s;ts on
the other &s;ide of the Adriatick into <HI>Al|bania,</HI>
for then their Territories would
have lain together, and have been nearer
the Fourtain-Head to have received Suc|cours
on occa&s;ions; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> are
under Articles with the Emperor, to re|&s;ign
into his Hands whatever they con|quer
of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, that has
been formerly di&s;membered from the
Empire. And having already very much
di&s;&s;atisfied him in the <HI>Frioul</HI> and <HI>Dalma|tia,</HI>
they dare not think of exa&s;perating
him further. The Pope di&s;putes with
them their Preten&s;ions to the <HI>Pole&s;in,</HI> as
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> lays an equal Claim
to the Kingdom of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> 'Tis &s;urpri|&s;ing
<PB N="70" REF="91">
to con&s;ider with what Heats the&s;e
Two Powers have conte&s;ted their Title
to a Kingdom that is in the Hands of
the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>Among all the&s;e Difficulties the Re|publick
will &s;till maintain it &s;elf, if Po|licy
can prevail upon Force; for it is
certain the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate is one of
the wi&s;e&s;t Councils in the World, tho'
at the &s;ame time, if we believe the Re|ports
of &s;everal that have been well
ver&s;ed in their Con&s;titution, a great part
of their Politics is founded on Maxims
which others do not think con&s;i&s;tent with
their Honour to put in practice. The
Pre&s;ervation of the Republick is that to
which all other Con&s;iderations &s;ubmit.
To encourage Idlene&s;s and Luxury in
the Nobility, to cheri&s;h Ignorance and
Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the Clergy, to keep
alive a continual Faction in the Common
People, to connive at the Viciou&s;ne&s;s
and Debauchery of Convents, to breed
Di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the Nobles of the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> to treat a brave Man with
Scorn and Infamy: In &s;hort, to &s;tick at
nothing for the Publick Intere&s;t, are re|pre&s;ented
as the refined Parts of the <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Among all the In&s;tances of their Po|litics,
there is none more admirable than
<PB N="71" REF="92">
the great Secrecy that reigns in their
Public Councils. The Senate is gene|rally
as numerous as our Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
if we only reckon the &s;itting
Members, and yet carries its Re&s;oluti|ons
&s;o privately, that they are &s;eldom
known 'till they di&s;cover them&s;elves in
the Execution. It is not many Years
&s;ince they had before them a great De|bate
concerning the Puni&s;hment of one
of their Admirals, which la&s;ted a Month
together, and concluded in his Condem|nation;
yet was there none of his Friends,
nor of tho&s;e who had engaged warmly
in his Defence, that gave him the lea&s;t
Intimation of what was pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t
him, 'till he was actually &s;eiz'd, and in
the Hands of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> think them&s;elves
equal at lea&s;t to the Electors of the Em|pire,
and but one Degree below Kings;
for which rea&s;on they &s;eldom travel in|to
Foreign Countries, where they mu&s;t
undergo the Mortification of being treat|ed
like private Gentlemen: Yet it is ob|&s;erved
of them, that they di&s;charge them|&s;elves
with a great deal of Dexterity in
&s;uch Emba&s;&s;ies and Treaties as are laid
on them by the Republick; for their
whole Lives are employed in Intrigues
<PB N="72" REF="93">
of State, and they naturally give them|&s;elves
Airs of Kings and Princes, of
which the Mini&s;ters of other Nations
are only the Repre&s;entatives. Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Amelot</HI> reckons in his Time, Two Thou|&s;and
Five Hundred Nobles that had
Voices in the great Council, but at pre|&s;ent,
I am told, there are not at mo&s;t
Fifteen Hundred, notwith&s;tanding the
Addition of many new Families &s;ince
that time. It is very &s;trange, that with
this Advantage they are not able to keep
up their Number, con&s;idering that the
Nobility &s;preads equally thro' all the
Brothers, and that &s;o very few of them
are de&s;troyed by the Wars of the Re|publick.
Whether this may be imputed
to the Luxury of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> or to
the ordinary Celibacy of the younger Bro|thers,
or to the la&s;t Plague which &s;wept
away many of them, I know not. They
generally thru&s;t the Females of their Fa|milies
into Convents, the better to pre|&s;erve
their E&s;tates. This makes the <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
Nuns famous for the Liberties they
allow them&s;elves. They have Opera's
within their own Walls, and often go
out of their Bounds to meet their Ad|mirers,
or they are very much mi&s;repre|&s;ented.
They have many of them their
Lovers, that conver&s;e with them daily at
<PB N="73" REF="94">
the Grate, and are very free to admit a
Vi&s;it from a Stranger. There is indeed
one of the <HI>Cornara's,</HI> that not long ago
refu&s;ed to &s;ee any under a Prince.</P>
<P>The Carnaval of <HI>Venice</HI> is every where
talked of. The great Diver&s;ion of the place
at that Time, as well as on all other high
Occa&s;ions, is Masking. The <HI>Venetians,</HI>
who are naturally Grave, love to give into
the Follies and Entertainments of &s;uch Sea|&s;ons,
when di&s;gui&s;ed in a fal&s;e Per&s;onage.
They are indeed under a nece&s;&s;ity of
finding out Diver&s;ions that may agree
with the Nature of the Place, and make
&s;ome Amends for the Lo&s;s of &s;everal Plea|&s;ures
which may be met with on the Con|tinent.
The&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es give Occa&s;ion
to abundance of Love Adventures; for
there is &s;omething more intriguing in the
Amours of <HI>Venice,</HI> than in tho&s;e of other
Countries, and I que&s;tion not but the
Secret Hi&s;tory of a Carnaval would make
a Collection of very diverting Novels.
Opera's are another great Entertain|ment
of this Sea&s;on. The Poetry of them
is generally as exqui&s;itely ill, as the
Mu&s;ick is good. The Arguments are
often taken from &s;ome celebrated Action
of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> which
&s;ometimes looks ridiculous enough; for
who can endure to hear one of the rough
<PB N="74" REF="95">
old <HI>Romans</HI> &s;queaking thro' the Mouth
of an Eunuch, e&s;pecially when they may
chu&s;e a Subject out of Courts where Eu|nuchs
are really Actors, or repre&s;ent by
them any of the &s;oft <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> Monarchs?
The Opera that was mo&s;t in Vogue,
during my Stay at <HI>Venice,</HI> was built on
the following Subject. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI>
are Rivals for <HI>Cato</HI>'s Daughter. <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>'s
fir&s;t Words bid his Soldiers fly, for
the Enemies are upon them. <HI>Si Leva
Ce&s;are, e dice a Soldati. A la fugga. A'
lo Scampo.</HI> The Daughter gives the Pre|ference
to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> which is made the
Occa&s;ion of <HI>Cato</HI>'s Death. Before he
kills him&s;elf, you &s;ee him withdrawn in|to
his Library, where, among his Books,
I ob&s;erved the Titles of <HI>Plutarch</HI> and
<HI>Ta&s;&s;o.</HI> After a &s;hort Soliloquy he &s;trikes
him&s;elf with the Dagger that he holds
in his Hand, but, being interrupted by
one of his Friends, he &s;tabs him for his
Pains, and by the Violence of the Blow
unluckily breaks the Dagger on one of
his Ribs, &s;o that he is forced to di&s;patch
him&s;elf by tearing up his fir&s;t Wound.
This la&s;t Circum&s;tance puts me in Mind
of a Contrivance in the Opera of St. <HI>An|gelo,</HI>
that was acted at the &s;ame time.
The King of the Play endeavours at a
Rape, but the Poet being re&s;olved to
<PB N="75" REF="96">
&s;ave his Heroine's Honour, has &s;o or|dered
it, that the King always acts with
a great Ca&s;e-Knife &s;tuck in his Girdle,
which the Lady &s;natches from him in
the Struggle, and &s;o defends her &s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Poets, be&s;ides the cele|brated
Smoothne&s;s of their Tongue, have
a particular Advantage, above the Wri|ters
of other Nations, in the difference
of their Poetical and Pro&s;e Language.
There are indeed Sets of Phra&s;es that in
all Countries are peculiar to the Poets,
but among the <HI>Italians</HI> there are not only
Sentences, but a Multitude of particu|lar
Words that never enter into common
Di&s;cour&s;e. They have &s;uch a different
Turn and Poli&s;hing for Poetical U&s;e, that
they drop &s;everal of their Letters, and
appear in another Form, when they
come to be ranged in Ver&s;e. For this
Rea&s;on the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera &s;eldom &s;inks
into a Poorne&s;s of Language, but, a|mid&s;t
all the Meanne&s;s and Familiarity
of the Thoughts, has &s;omething beau|tiful
and &s;onorous in the Expre&s;&s;ion.
Without this natural Advantage of the
Tongue, their pre&s;ent Poetry would
appear wretchedly low and vulgar, not|with&s;tanding
the many &s;trained Allego|ries
that are &s;o much in u&s;e among the
Writers of this Nation. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="97">
and <HI>French,</HI> who always u&s;e the &s;ame
Words in Ver&s;e as in ordinary Conver|&s;ation,
are forced to rai&s;e their Language
with Metaphors and Figures, or, by
the Pompou&s;ne&s;s of the whole Phra&s;e,
to wear off any Littlene&s;s that appears
in the particular Parts that compo&s;e it.
This makes our Blank Ver&s;e, where
there is no Rhime to &s;upport the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
extreamly difficult to &s;uch as
are not Ma&s;ters in the Tongue, e&s;peci|ally
when they write on low Subjects;
and 'tis probably for this Rea&s;on that
<HI>Milton</HI> has made u&s;e of &s;uch frequent
Tran&s;po&s;itions, Latini&s;ms, antiquated
Words and Phra&s;es, that he might the
better deviate from vulgar and ordinary
Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Comedies that I &s;aw at <HI>Venice,</HI>
or indeed in any other Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> are
very indifferent, and more lewd than
tho&s;e of other Countries. Their Poets
have no Notion of gentile Comedy, and
fall into the mo&s;t filthy double Mean|ings
imaginable, when they have a Mind
to make their Audience merry. There
is no Part generally &s;o wretched as that
of the fine Gentleman, e&s;pecially when
he Conver&s;es with his Mi&s;tre&s;s; for then
the whole Dialogue is an in&s;ipid mix|ture
of Pedantry and Romance. But
<PB N="77" REF="98">
'tis no wonder that the Poets of &s;o Jea|lous
and Re&s;erved a Nation fail in &s;uch
Conver&s;ations on the Stage, as they have
no Patterns of in Nature. There are
Four Standing Characters which enter
into every Piece that comes on the Stage,
the <HI>Doctor, Harlequin, Pantalone</HI> and <HI>Co|viello.</HI>
The <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Character com|prehends
the whole Extent of a Pedant,
that with a deep Voice, and a Magi|&s;terial
Air breaks in upon Conver&s;ation,
and drives down all before him: Every
thing he &s;ays is backed with Quotati|ons
out of <HI>Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Vir|gil,</HI>
or any Author that ri&s;es uppermo&s;t,
aad all An&s;wers from his Companion are
looked upon as Impertinencies or Inter|ruptions.
<HI>Harlequin</HI>'s Part is made up
of Blunders and Ab&s;urdities: He is to
mi&s;take one Name for another, to for|get
his Errands, to &s;tumble over Queens,
and to run his Head again&s;t every Po&s;t
that &s;tands in his way. This is all at|tended
with &s;omething &s;o Comical in
the Voice and Ge&s;tures, that a Man,
who is &s;en&s;ible of the Folly of the Part,
can hardly forbear being plea&s;ed with it.
<HI>Pantalone</HI> is generally an old Cully, and
<HI>Coviello</HI> a Sharper.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Cid</HI>
acted at <HI>Bolonia,</HI> which would never
<PB N="78" REF="99">
have taken, had they not found a Place
in it for the&s;e Buffoons. All Four of
them appear in Masks that are made
like the old <HI>Roman Per&s;onae,</HI> as I &s;hall
have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in another
Place. The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> have
probably derived this Cu&s;tom of &s;hew|ing
&s;ome of their Characters in Masks,
from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Theater. The
old <HI>Vatican Terence</HI> has at the Head of
every Scene the Figures of all the Per|&s;ons
that are concerned in it, with the
particular Di&s;gui&s;es in which they acted;
and I remember to have &s;een in the <HI>Vil|la
Mattheio</HI> an Antick Statue mask'd,
which was perhaps de&s;igned for <HI>Gnatho</HI>
in the Eunuch, for it agrees exactly
with the Figure he makes in the <HI>Vati|can</HI>
Manu&s;cript. One would wonder
indeed how &s;o Polite a People, as the
ancient <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Athenians,</HI> &s;hould
not look on the&s;e borrowed Faces as un|natural.
They might do very well for
a Cyclops, or a Satyr, that can have no
Re&s;emblance in Human Features; but
for a Flatterer, a Mi&s;er, or the like Cha|racters,
which abound in our own Spe|cies,
nothing is more ridiculous than to
repre&s;ent their Looks by a painted Vi|zard.
In Per&s;ons of this Nature the
Turns and Motions of the Face are of|ten
<PB N="79" REF="100">
as agreeable as any part of the Action.
Could we &s;uppo&s;e that a Mask repre&s;ent|ed
never &s;o naturally the general Hu|mour
of a Character, it can never &s;uit
with the Variety of Pa&s;&s;ions that are in|cident
to every &s;ingle Per&s;on in the whole
Cour&s;e of a Play. The Grimace may
be proper on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, but is too
&s;teady to agree with all. The Rabble
indeed are generally plea&s;ed at the fir&s;t
Entry of a Di&s;gui&s;e, but the Je&s;t grows
cold even with them too when it comes
on the Stage in a Second Scene.</P>
<P>Since I am on this Subject, I cannot
forbear mentioning a Cu&s;tom at <HI>Venice,</HI>
which they tell me is particular to the
common People of this Country, of &s;ing|ing
Stanza's out of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o.</HI> They are &s;et
to a pretty Solemn Tune, and when one
begins in any part of the Poet, it is odds
but he will be an&s;wered by &s;ome Body
el&s;e that over-hears him: So that &s;ome|times
you have Ten or a Dozen in the
Neighbourhood of one another, taking
Ver&s;e after Ver&s;e, and running on with
the Poem as far as their Memories will
carry them.</P>
<P>On Holy-<HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> among the &s;eve|ral
Shows that are yearly exhibited, I
&s;aw one that is odd enough, and parti|cular
to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> There is a Set
<PB N="80" REF="101">
of Arti&s;ans, who by the help of &s;everal
Poles, which they lay acro&s;s each others
Shoulders, build them&s;elves up into a
kind of Pyramid; &s;o that you &s;ee a
Pile of Men in the Air of Four or Five
Rows ri&s;ing one above another. The
Weight is &s;o equally di&s;tributed, that
every Man is very well able to bear his part
of it, the Stories, if I may &s;o call them,
growing le&s;s and le&s;s as they advance high|er
and higher. A little Boy repre&s;ents the
Point of the Pyramid, who, after a
&s;hort &s;pace, leaps off, with a great deal
of Dexterity, into the Arms of one that
catches him at the Bottom. In the &s;ame
manner the whole Building falls to pie|ces.
I have been the more particular on
this, becau&s;e it explains the following
Ver&s;es of <HI>Claudian,</HI> which &s;how that the
<HI>Venetians</HI> are not the Inventors of this
Trick.<Q><L>Vel qui mere avium &s;e&s;e jaculantur in auras,</L>

<P>At <HI>Ferrara</HI> I met nothing extraordi|nary.
The Town is very large, but ex|treamly
thin of People. It has a Cita|del,
and &s;omething like a Fortification
running round it, but &s;o large that it
requires more Soldiers to defend it, than
the Pope has in his whole Dominions.
The Streets are as beautiful as any I have
&s;een, in their Length, Breadth, and Re|gularity.
The <HI>Benedictins</HI> have the fine&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="109">
Convent of the Place. They &s;how'd
us in the Church <HI>Ari&s;to</HI>'s Monument:

<P>I came down a Branch of the <HI>Po,</HI> as
far as <HI>Alberto,</HI> within Ten Miles of <HI>Ra|venna.</HI>
All this Space lyes mi&s;erably un|cultivated
'till you come near <HI>Ravenna,</HI>
where the Soil is made extreamly fruit|ful,
and &s;hows that much of the re&s;t
might, be were there. Hands enough to
manage it to the be&s;t Advantage. It is
now on both &s;ides the Road very Mar&s;hy,
and generally over-grown with Ru&s;hes,
which made me fancy it was once float|ed
by the Sea, that lyes within Four
Miles of it. Nor could I in the lea&s;t
doubt it when I &s;aw <HI>Ravenna,</HI> that is
now almo&s;t at the &s;ame di&s;tance from
the Adriatic, tho' it was formerly the
mo&s;t famous of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Ports.</P>
<P>One may gue&s;s at its ancient Situation
from <HI>Martial</HI>'s

<P>Accordingly the old Geographers re|pre&s;ent
it as &s;ituated among Mar&s;hes and
Shallows. The Place which is &s;hown
for the Haven, is on a Level with the
Town, and has probably been &s;topped
up by the great Heaps of Dirt that the Sea
has thrown into it; for all the Soil on
that &s;ide of <HI>Ravenna</HI> has been left there
in&s;en&s;ibly by the Sea's di&s;charging it &s;elf
upon it for &s;o many Ages. The Ground
mu&s;t have been formerly much lower,
for otherwi&s;e the Town would have
lain under Water. The Remains of the
<HI>Pharos,</HI> that &s;tand about Three Miles
from the Sea, and Two from the Town,
have their Foundations covered with
Earth for &s;ome Yards, as they told me,
<PB N="90" REF="111">
which notwith&s;tanding are upon a Level
with the Fields that lye about them,
tho' 'tis probable they took the Advan|tage
of a ri&s;ing Ground to &s;et it upon.
It was a &s;quare Tower of about Twelve
Yards in Breadth, as appears by that
part of it which yet remains entire, &s;o
that its Height mu&s;t have been very con|&s;iderable
to have pre&s;erved a Proportion.
It is made in the Form of the <HI>Venetian
Campanello,</HI> and is probably the high
Tower mentioned by <HI>Pliny, Lib.</HI> 36.
<HI>cap.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the Town, where the
Sea is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain formerly,
there is now a little Church called the
<HI>Rotonda.</HI> At the Entrance of it are Two
Stones, the one with an In&s;cription in
<HI>Gothic</HI> Characters, that has nothing in
it remarkable; the other is a &s;quare
Piece of Marble, that by the In&s;cription
appears ancient, and by the Ornaments
about it &s;hows it &s;elf to have been a lit|tle
Pagan Monument of Two Per&s;ons
who were Shipwreck'd, perhaps in the
Place where now their Monument &s;tands.
The fir&s;t Line and a half, that tells their
Names and Families in Pro&s;e, is not le|gible;
the re&s;t runs thus,<Q><L>&mdash;Raniae domus hos produxit alumnos,</L>

</LG></Q>

</P>
<P>There is a Turn in the Third Ver&s;e
that we lo&s;e, by not knowing the Cir|cum&s;tances
of their Story. It was the
<HI>Naufraga mors</HI> which de&s;troyed them,
as it had formerly united them; what
this Union was is expre&s;&s;ed in the pre|ceding
Ver&s;e, by their both having been
made Free-men on the &s;ame Day. If
therefore we &s;uppo&s;e they had been for|merly
Shipwreck'd with their Ma&s;ter,
and that he made them Free at the &s;ame
time, the <HI>Epigram</HI> is unriddled. Nor is
this Interpretation perhaps &s;o forc'd as
it may &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;ince it was
the Cu&s;tom of the Ma&s;ters, a little be|fore
their Death, to give their Slaves
their Freedom, if they had de&s;erv'd it at
their Hands; and it is natural enough
<PB N="92" REF="113">
to &s;uppo&s;e one, involved in a common
Shipwreck, would give &s;uch of his Slaves
their Liberty, as &s;hould have the good
Luck to &s;ave them&s;elves. The Chancel
of this Church is vaulted with a &s;ingle
Stone of Four Foot in Thickne&s;s, and
a Hundred and Fourteen in Circumfe|rence.
There &s;tood on the Out&s;ide of
this little Cupola a great Tomb of <HI>Por|phyry,</HI>
and the Statues of the Twelve A|po&s;tles;
but in the War that <HI>Louis</HI> the
Twelfth made on <HI>Italy,</HI> the Tomb was
broken in pieces by a Cannon-Ball.
It was, perhaps, the &s;ame Blow that
made the Flaw in the Cupola, tho' the
Inhabitants &s;ay it was crack'd by Thun|der,
that de&s;troyed a Son of one of their
<HI>Gothic</HI> Princes, who had taken Shelter
under it, as having been foretold what
kind of Death he was to die. I asked an
Abbot, that was in the Church, what
was the Name of this <HI>Gothic</HI> Prince, who,
after a little Recollection, an&s;wered me,
That he could not tell preci&s;ely, but
that he thought it was one <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI>
There is a Convent of <HI>Theatins,</HI> where
they &s;how a little Window in the
Church, thro' which the Holy Gho&s;t
is &s;aid to have entered in the Shape of
a Dove, and to have &s;ettled on one of
the Candidates for the Bi&s;hoprick. The
<PB N="93" REF="114">
Dove is repre&s;ented in the Window, and
in &s;everal Places of the Church, and is
in great Reputation all over <HI>Italy.</HI> I &s;hould
not indeed think it impo&s;&s;ible for a Pi|geon
to fly in accidentally thro' the Roof,
where they &s;till keep the Hole open,
and by its fluttering over &s;uch a parti|cular
Place, to give &s;o &s;uper&s;titious
an A&s;&s;embly an Occa&s;ion of favouring a
Competitor, e&s;pecially if he had many
Friends among the Electors that would
make a politick U&s;e of &s;uch an Acci|dent:
But they pretend the Miracle has
happened more than once. Among the
Pictures of &s;everal famous Men of their
Order, there is one with this In&s;cripti|on.

The Statue of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Se|venth
&s;tands in the large Square of the
Town; it is ca&s;t in Bra&s;s, and has the
Po&s;ture that is always given the Figure
of a Pope; an Arm extended, and ble&s;|&s;ing
the People. In another Square on
a high Pillar is &s;et the Statue of the ble&s;|&s;ed
Virgin, arrayed like a Queen, with
a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown up|on
her Head; for having delivered the
Town from a raging Pe&s;tilence. The
Cu&s;tom of Crowning the Holy Virgin
<PB N="94" REF="115">
is &s;o much in Vogue among the <HI>Itali|ans,</HI>
that one often &s;ees in their Churches
a little Tin&s;el Crown, or perhaps a Cir|cle

the Head of the Figure, which &s;ome|times
&s;poils a good Picture. In the Con|vent
of <HI>Benedictins</HI> I &s;aw Three huge

&s;aid to contain the A&s;hes of <HI>Valentinian,</HI>

and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> for the In&s;cription is &s;till

pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rubicon.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I can

It is built of hewn Stone, like the
Pede&s;tal of a Pillar, but &s;omething high|er
than ordinary, and is but ju&s;t broad
enough for one Man to &s;tand upon it.
On the contrary, the ancient <HI>Sugge|&s;tums,</HI>
as I have often ob&s;erved on Me|dals,
<PB N="96" REF="117">
as well as on <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Arch,

often &s;ee on them the Emperor, and
Two or Three General Officers, &s;ome|times
&s;itting and &s;ometimes &s;tanding, as
they made Speeches, or di&s;tributed a
Congiary to the Soldiers or People.
They were probably always in readine&s;s,
and carried among the Baggage of the
Army, whereas this at <HI>Rimini</HI> mu&s;t have
been built on the Place, and required
&s;ome time before it could be fini&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>THE
REPUBLICK
OF
St. MARINO.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Town and Republick of
St. <HI>Marino</HI> &s;tands on the Top
of a very high and craggy
Mountain. It is generally
hid among the Clouds, and
lay under Snow when I &s;aw it, tho' it
was clear and warm Weather in all the
Country about it. There is not a Spring
or Fountain, that I could hear of, in the
whole Dominions, but they are always
well provided with huge Ci&s;terns and
Re&s;ervoirs of Rain and Snow-Water.
The Wine that grows on the &s;ides of
their Mountain is extraordinary good,
and I think much better than any I met
with on the cold &s;ide of the <HI>Appenines.</HI>
This puts me in Mind of their Cellars,
which have mo&s;t of 'em a natural Ad|vantage
that renders 'em extreamly cool
<PB N="100" REF="121">
in the hotte&s;t Sea&s;ons, for they have ge|nerally
in the Sides of them deep Holes
that run into the Hollows of the Hill,
from whence there con&s;tantly i&s;&s;ues a
breathing kind of Vapour, &s;o very chil|ling
in the Summer time, that a Man
can &s;carce &s;uffer his Hand in the Wind of
it.</P>
<P>This Mountain, and a few neighbour|ing
Hillocks that lye &s;catter'd about the
Bottom of it, is the whole Circuit of
the&s;e Dominions. They have, what
they call, Three Ca&s;tles, Three Convents,
and Five Churches, and can reckon about
Five Thou&s;and Souls in their Communi|ty.
The Inhabitants as well as the Hi&s;tori|ans,
who mention this little Republick,
give the following Account of its Original.
St. <HI>Marino</HI> was its Founder, a <HI>Dalmatian</HI>
by Birth, and by Trade a Ma&s;on. He
was employed above Thirteen Hundred
Years ago in the Reparation of <HI>Rimini,</HI>
and, after he had fini&s;h'd his Work,
retired to this &s;olitary Mountain, as find|ing
it very proper for the Life of a Her|mit,
which he led in the greate&s;t Ri|gours
and Au&s;terities of Religion. He
had not been long here before he wrought
a reputed Miracle, which, join'd with
his extraordinary Sanctity, gained him
&s;o great an E&s;teem, that the Prince&s;s of
<PB N="101" REF="122">
the Country made him a Pre&s;ent of the
Mountain to di&s;po&s;e of it at his own Di|&s;cretion.
His Reputation quickly Peo|pled
it, and gave Ri&s;e to the Republick
which calls it &s;elf after his Name. So that
the Common-wealth of <HI>Marino</HI> may boa&s;t
at lea&s;t of a nobler Original than that of
<HI>Rome,</HI> the one having been at fir&s;t an
<HI>A&s;ylum</HI> for Robbers and Murderers, and
the other a Re&s;ort of Per&s;ons eminent for
their Piety and Devotion. The be&s;t of
their Churches is Dedicated to the Saint,
and holds his A&s;hes. His Statue &s;tands
over the high Altar, with the Figure of
a Mountain in its Hands, crown'd with
Three Ca&s;tles, which is likewi&s;e the
Arms of the Common-wealth. They at|tribute
to his Protection the long Dura|tion
of their State, and look on him as
the greate&s;t Saint next the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin.
I &s;aw in their Statute-Book a Law a|gain&s;t
&s;uch as &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of him,
who are to be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame man|ner
as tho&s;e who are Convicted of Bla&s;|phemy.</P>
<P>This petty Republick has now la&s;ted
Thirteen hundred Years, while all the
other States of <HI>Italy</HI> have &s;everal times
changed their Ma&s;ters and Forms of Go|vernment.
Their whole Hi&s;tory is com|pris'd
in Two Purcha&s;es, which they
<PB N="102" REF="123">
made of a neighbouring Prince, and in
a War in which they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Pope
again&s;t a Lord of <HI>Rimini.</HI> In the Year
1100 they bought a Ca&s;tle in the Neigh|bourhood,
as they did another in the
Year 1170. The Papers of the Condi|tions
are pre&s;erv'd in their Archives,
where 'tis very remarkable that the
Name of the Agent for the Common-wealth,
of the Seller, of the Notary,
and the Witne&s;&s;es, are the &s;ame in both
the In&s;truments, tho' drawn up at Seven|ty
Years di&s;tance from each other. Nor
can it be any Mi&s;take in the Date, be|cau&s;e
the Popes and Emperors Names,
with the Year of their re&s;pective Reigns,
are both punctually &s;et down. About
290 Years after this they a&s;&s;i&s;ted Pope
<HI>Pius</HI> the Second again&s;t one of the <HI>Ma|late&s;ta's,</HI>
who was then Lord of <HI>Rimini</HI>;
and when they had helped to conquer
him, received from the Pope, as a Re|ward
for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Four little Ca|&s;tles.
This they repre&s;ent as the flou|ri&s;hing
Time of the Common-wealth,
when their Dominions reach'd half way
up a neighbouring Hill; but at pre&s;ent
they are reduced to their old Extent.
They would probably &s;ell their Liberty
as dear as they could to any that attacked
them; for there is but one Road by
<PB N="103" REF="124">
which to climb up to them, and they
have a very &s;evere Law again&s;t any of
their own Body that enters the Town
by another Path, le&s;t any new one
&s;hould be worn on the Sides of their
Mountain. All that are capable of bear|ing
Arms are exercis'd, and ready at a
Moment's Call.</P>
<P>The Sovereign Power of the Repub|lick
was lodg'd originally in what they
call the <HI>Arengo,</HI> a great Council in which
every Hou&s;e had its Repre&s;entative. But
becau&s;e they found too much Confu&s;ion
in &s;uch a Multitude of State&s;men, they
devolv'd their whole Authority into the
Hands of the Council of Sixty. The
<HI>Arengo</HI> however is &s;till called together
in Ca&s;es of extraordinary Importance;
and if, after due Summons, any Mem|ber
ab&s;ents him&s;elf, he is to be Fin'd to
the value of about a Penny <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which
the Statute &s;ays he &s;hall pay, <HI>Sine ali|qu&acirc;
diminutione aut grati&acirc;.</HI> In the ordi|nary
Cour&s;e of Government, the Coun|cil
of Sixty (which, notwith&s;tanding
the Name; con&s;i&s;ts but of Forty Per&s;ons)
has in its Hands the Admini&s;tration of
Affairs, and is made up half out of the
Noble Families, and half out of the
<HI>Plebeian.</HI> They decide all by Baloting,
are not admitted 'till Five and Twenty
<PB N="104" REF="125">
Years old, and chu&s;e the Officers of the
Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Thus far they agree with the Great
Council of <HI>Venice,</HI> but their Power is
much more extended; for no Sentence
can &s;tand that is not confirmed by Two
Thirds of this Council. Be&s;ides, that
no Son can be admitted into it during
the Life of his Father, nor Two be in it of
the &s;ame Family, nor any enter but by E|lection.
The chief Officers of the Com|mon-wealth
are the Two <HI>Capitaneos,</HI> who
have &s;uch a Power as the old <HI>Roman</HI> Con|&s;uls
had, but are cho&s;en every Six Months.
I talk'd with &s;ome that had been <HI>Capi|taneos</HI>
Six or Seven times, tho' the Office
is never to be continu'd to the &s;ame Per|&s;ons
twice &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The Third Of|ficer
is the Commi&s;&s;ary, who judges in
all Civil and Criminal Matters. But be|cau&s;e
the many Alliances, Friend&s;hips,
and Intermarriages, as well as the Per|&s;onal
Feuds and Animo&s;ities that happen
among &s;o &s;mall a People might ob&s;truct
the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, if one of their
own Number had the Di&s;tribution of it;
they have always a Foreigner for this Em|ploy,
whom they chu&s;e for Three Years,
and maintain out of the Publick Stock.
He mu&s;t be a Doctor of Law, and a
Man of known Integrity. He is join'd
<PB N="105" REF="126">
in Commi&s;&s;ion with the <HI>Capitaneos,</HI> and
acts &s;omething like the Recorder of
<HI>London</HI> under the Lord Mayor. The
Common-wealth of <HI>Genoa</HI> was forc'd to
make u&s;e of a foreign Judge for many
Years, whil&s;t their Republick was torn
into the Divi&s;ions of <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Gibe|lines.</HI>
The Fourth Man in the State is
the Phy&s;ician, who mu&s;t likewi&s;e be a
Stranger, and is maintain'd by a publick
Salary. He is oblig'd to keep a Hor&s;e,
to vi&s;it the Sick, and to in&s;pect all
Drugs that are imported. He mu&s;t be
at lea&s;t Thirty Five Years old, a Do|ctor
of the Faculty, and eminent for
his Religion and Hone&s;ty; that his Ra&s;h|ne&s;s
or Ignorance may not unpeople the
Common-wealth. And that they may
not &s;uffer long under any bad Choice, he
is elected only for Three Years. The
pre&s;ent Phy&s;ician is a very under&s;tand|ing
Man, and well read in our Country|men,
<HI>Harvey, Willis, Sydenham,</HI> &amp;c.
He has been continu'd for &s;ome time
among 'em, and they &s;ay the Common-wealth
thrives under his Hands. Ano|ther

<HEAD>Pe&s;aro, Fano, Senigallia,
Ancona, Loretto, &amp;c.
To ROME.</HEAD>
<P>_FROM <HI>Rimini</HI> to <HI>Loretto</HI> the
Towns of Note are <HI>Pe&s;aro,</HI>
<HI>Fano, Senigallia</HI> and <HI>Ancona.
Fano</HI> received its Name from
the Fane or Temple of For|tune
that &s;tood in it. One may &s;till &s;ee
the Triumphal Arch erected there to
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>: It is indeed very much de|fac'd
by Time, but the Plan of it, as it
&s;tood entire with all its In&s;criptions, is
neatly cut upon the Wall of a neigh|bouring
Building. In each of the&s;e
Towns is a beautiful Marble Fountain,
where the Water runs continually thro'
&s;everal little Spouts, which looks very
refre&s;hing in the&s;e hot Countries, and
gives a great Coolne&s;s to the Air about
them. That of <HI>Pe&s;aro</HI> is hand&s;omly de|&s;igned.
<HI>Ancona</HI> is much the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
<PB N="108" REF="129">
of the&s;e Towns. It &s;tands on
a Promontory, and looks more beauti|ful
at a di&s;tance than when you are in
it. The Port was made by <HI>Trajan,</HI>
for which he has a Triumphal Arch e|rected
to him by the Sea-&s;ide. The
Marble of this Arch looks very white
and fre&s;h, as being expo&s;ed to the Winds
and Salt Sea-Vapours, that by continu|ally
fretting it pre&s;eves it &s;elf from that
mouldy Colour, which others of the
&s;ame Materials have contracted. Tho'
the <HI>Italians</HI> and Voyage-Writers call
the&s;e of <HI>Rimini, Fano,</HI> and <HI>Ancona</HI> Tri|umphal
Arches, there was probably
&s;ome Di&s;tinction made among the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
between &s;uch Honorary Arches e|rected
to Emperors, and tho&s;e that
were rais'd to them on the Account of
a Victory, which are properly Trium|phal
Arches. This at <HI>Ancona</HI> was an In|&s;tance
of Gratitude to <HI>Trajan</HI> for the
Port he had made there, as the two o|thers
I have mention'd were probably
for &s;ome Rea&s;on of the &s;ame Nature.
One may however ob&s;erve the Wi&s;dom
of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> who to encou|rage
their Emperors in their Inclina|tion
of doing good to their Coun|try,
gave the &s;ame Honours to the great
Actions of Peace, which turn'd to the
<PB N="109" REF="130">
Advantage of the Publick, as to tho&s;e
of War. This is very remarkable in the
Medals that were &s;tamp'd on the &s;ame
Occa&s;ions. I remember to have &s;een
one of <HI>Galba</HI>'s with a Triumphal Arch
on the Rever&s;e, that was made by the

a Tax. <HI>R. XXXX. REMISSA. S. C.</HI>
The Medal which was made for <HI>Trajan</HI>
in Remembrance of his Benificence to
<HI>Ancona</HI> is very common. The Rever&s;e
has on it a Port with a Chain running
a-cro&s;s it, and betwixt them both a Boat
with this In&s;cription, <HI>S. P. Q. R. OP|TIMO

his Additions to <HI>Angeloni,</HI> has &s;ufficiently

<P>At <HI>Loretto</HI> I enquir'd for the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>

Pictures of &s;uch as had been Execu|ted

Thirty. Whatever were their Crimes,
the In&s;cription &s;ays they &s;uffer'd for their
Religion, and &s;ome of 'em are repre&s;ent|ed
lying under &s;uch Tortures as are not
in u&s;e among us. The Martyrs of 1679
are &s;et by them&s;elves, with a Knife

<P><PB N="111" REF="132">
The Riches in the Holy Hou&s;e and
Trea&s;ury are &s;urprizingly great, and as
much &s;urpa&s;s'd my Expectation as other
Sights have generally fallen &s;hort of it.
Silver can &s;carce find an Admi&s;&s;ion, and
Gold it &s;elf looks but poorly among &s;uch
an incredible number of precious Stones.
There will be, in a few Ages more, the
Jewels of the greate&s;t Value in <HI>Europe,</HI>
if the Devotion of its Princes continues
in its pre&s;ent Fervour. The la&s;t Offer|ing
was made by the Queen Dowager
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and co&s;t her 18000 Crowns.
Some have wonder'd that the <HI>Turk</HI> ne|ver
attacks this Trea&s;ury, &s;ince it lyes
&s;o near the Sea-&s;hore, and is &s;o weakly
guarded. But be&s;ides that he has at|tempted
it formerly with no Succe&s;s, it
is certain the <HI>Venetians</HI> keep too watch|ful
an Eye over his Motions at pre&s;ent,
and would never &s;uffer him to enter the
Adriatic. It would indeed be an ea&s;ie
thing for a Chri&s;tian Prince to &s;urprize
it, who has Ships &s;till pa&s;&s;ing to and fro
without Su&s;picion, e&s;pecially if he had
a Party in the Town, di&s;guis'd like Pil|grims,
to &s;ecure a Gate for him; for
there have been &s;ometimes to the Num|ber
of 100000 in a Day's time, as it is
generally reported. But 'tis probable
the Veneration for the Holy Hou&s;e, and
<PB N="112" REF="133">
the Horror of an Action that would be
re&s;ented by all the Catholick Princes of
<HI>Europe,</HI> will be as great a Security to the
Place as the &s;tronge&s;t Fortification. It
is indeed an amazing thing to &s;ee &s;uch a
prodigious Quantity of Riches lye dead,
and untouch'd in the mid&s;t of &s;o much
Poverty and Mi&s;ery as reign on all &s;ides
of 'em. There is no que&s;tion, how|ever,
but the Pope would make u&s;e of
the&s;e Trea&s;ures in ca&s;e of any great Cala|mity
that &s;hould endanger the Holy See;
as an unfortunate War with the <HI>Turk,</HI> or a
powerful League among the Prote&s;tants.
For I can't but look on tho&s;e va&s;t Heaps
of Wealth, that are ama&s;s'd together in
&s;o many Religious Places of <HI>Italy,</HI> as the
hidden Re&s;erves and Magazines of the
Church, that &s;he would open on any
pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion for her la&s;t Defence
and Pre&s;ervation. If the&s;e Riches were
all turn'd into current Coin, and em|ploy'd
in Commerce, they would make
<HI>Italy</HI> the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Country in
<HI>Europe.</HI> The Ca&s;e of the Holy Hou&s;e
is nobly de&s;ign'd, and executed by the
great Ma&s;ters of <HI>Italy,</HI> that flouri&s;h'd
about a hundred Years ago. The Sta|tues
of the <HI>Sibyls</HI> are very finely wrought,
each of 'em in a different Air and Po|&s;ture,
as are likewi&s;e tho&s;e of the Pro|phets
<PB N="113" REF="134">
underneath 'em. The Roof of
the Trea&s;ury is painted with the &s;ame
kind of Device. There &s;tands at the up|per
End of it a large Crucifix very much
e&s;teem'd, the Figure of our Saviour re|pre&s;ents
him in his la&s;t Agonies of Death,
and amid&s;t all the Gha&s;tline&s;s of the Vi|&s;age
has &s;omething in it very amiable.
The Gates of the Church are &s;aid to be
of <HI>Corinthian</HI> Bra&s;s, with many Scripture
Stories ri&s;ing on 'em in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo.</HI>
The Pope's Statue, and the Fountain
by it, would make a noble Show in a
Place le&s;s beautified with &s;o many other
Productions of Art. The Spicery, the
Cellar and its Furniture, the great Re|venues
of the Convent, with the Story
of the Holy Hou&s;e, are too well known
to be here in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P>Whoever were the fir&s;t Inventors of
this Impo&s;ture, they &s;eem to have taken
the hint of it from the Veneration that
the old <HI>Romans</HI> paid to the Cottage of
<HI>Romulus,</HI> which &s;tood on Mount <HI>Capitol,</HI>
and was repair'd from time to time as
it fell to decay. <HI>Virgil</HI> has given a pret|ty
Image of this little thatch'd Palace,

has in the Church an incomparable <HI>Ma|donna</HI>
of <HI>Raphel.</HI> At <HI>Spoletto,</HI> the next
Town on the Road, are &s;ome Antiqui|ties.
The mo&s;t remarkable is an Aquae|duct
of a <HI>Gothic</HI> Structure, that conveys
the Water from Mount St. <HI>Francis</HI> to
<HI>Spoletto,</HI> which is not to be equall'd for
its height by any other in <HI>Europe.</HI> They
reckon from the Foundation of the low|e&s;t
Arch to the Top of it 230 Yards.
In my way hence to <HI>Terni</HI> I &s;aw the
River <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> celebrated by &s;o many
of the Poets for a particular Quality in
its Waters of making Cattle white that

drink of it. The Inhabitants of that
Country have &s;till the &s;ame Opinion of
it, as I found upon Enquiry, and have
a great many Oxen of a whiti&s;h Colour
to confirm 'em in it. It is probable this
Breed was fir&s;t &s;ettled in the Country,
and continuing &s;till the &s;ame Species,
has made the Inhabitants impute it to a

fancy their Hogs turn black for &s;ome
Rea&s;on of the &s;ame Nature, becau&s;e there
are none in <HI>Italy</HI> of any other Breed.

at the end of it, by which it is plain
there was once the Name of another
Con&s;ul, which has been indu&s;triou&s;ly
razed out. <HI>Lucias Aruncius Camillus
Scribonianus</HI> was Con&s;ul under the Reign
of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fa&s;t. Con&s;ul. Sicul.</NOTE> <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and was afterwards put to
Death for a Con&s;piracy that he had
form'd again&s;t the Emperor <HI>Claudius</HI>;
at which time it was order'd that his
Name and Con&s;ulate &s;hould be effaced
out of all publick Regi&s;ters and In&s;crip|tions.
It is not therefore improbable,
that it was this long Name which fill'd
up the Gap I am now mentioning.
There are near this Monument the Ru|ins
of an ancient Theatre, with &s;ome of
the Caves entire. I &s;aw among the Ru|ins
<PB N="119" REF="140">
an old Heathen Altar, with this Par|ticularity
in it, that it is hollow'd, like
a Di&s;h, at one End; but it was not this
End on which the Sacrifice was laid,
as one may gue&s;s from the Make of the
Fe&s;toon, that runs round the Altar,
and is inverted when the Hollow
&s;tands uppermo&s;t. In the &s;ame Yard,
among the Rubbi&s;h of the Theatre, lye
Two Pillars, the one of Granate, and
the other of a very beautiful Marble.
I went out of my way to &s;ee the Famous
<HI>Ca&s;cade</HI> about Three Miles from <HI>Terni.</HI>
It it form'd by the Fall of the River
<HI>Velino,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions in the
Seventh <HI>Aeneid&mdash;Ro&s;ed rura Velini.</HI></P>
<P>The Channel of this River lyes very
high, and is &s;haded on all &s;ides by a Green
Fore&s;t, made up of &s;everal kinds of Trees
that pre&s;erve their Verdure all the Year.
The neighbouring Mountains are co|ver'd
with them, and by rea&s;on of their
height are more expos'd to the Dews and
drizzling Rains than any of the adjacent
Parts, which gives occa&s;ion to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Ro|&s;ea
rura,</HI> (Dewy Countries.) The River
runs extreamly rapid before its Fall, and
ru&s;hes down a Precipice of a Hundred
Yards high. It throws it &s;elf into the Hol|low
of a Rock, which has probably been
<PB N="120" REF="141">
worn by &s;uch a con&s;tant Fall of Water.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the Bottom on
which it breaks for the Thickne&s;s of the
Mi&s;t that ri&s;es from it, which looks at
a Di&s;tance like Clouds of Smoak a&s;|cending
from &s;ome va&s;t Furnace, and
di&s;tils in perpetual Rains on all the Pla|ces
that lye near it. I think there is
&s;omething more a&s;toni&s;hing in this <HI>Ca&s;|cade,</HI>
than in all the Water-Works of
<HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and could not but wonder
when I fir&s;t &s;aw it, that I had never
met with it in any of the old Poets,
e&s;pecially in <HI>Claudian,</HI> who makes his
Emperor <HI>Honorius.</HI> go out of his way to
&s;ee the River <HI>Nar</HI> which runs ju&s;t be|low
it, and yet does not mention what
would have been &s;o great an Embelli&s;h|ment
to his Poem. But at pre&s;ent I don't
in the lea&s;t que&s;tion, notwith&s;tanding
the Opinion of &s;ome Learned Men to
the contrary, that this is the Gulf thro'
which <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Alecto</HI> &s;hoots her &s;elf into
Hell: for the very Place, the great Re|putation
of it, the Fall of Waters, the
Woods that encompa&s;s it, with the
Smoak and Noi&s;e that ari&s;e from it,
are all pointed at in the De&s;cription. Per|haps

<HEAD>FROM
ROME
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>_UPON my Arrival at <HI>Rome</HI>
I took a View of St. <HI>Peters,</HI>
and the <HI>Rotunda,</HI> leaving
the re&s;t 'till my Return from
<HI>Naples,</HI> when I &s;hould have
time and lei&s;ure enough to con&s;ider
what I &s;aw. St. <HI>Peters</HI> &s;eldom an&s;wers
Expectation at fir&s;t entering it, but en|larges
it &s;elf on all Sides in&s;en&s;ibly, and
mends upon the Eye every Moment.
The Proportions are &s;o very well ob&s;erv'd,
that nothing appears to an Advantage,
or di&s;tingui&s;hes it &s;elf above the re&s;t. It
&s;eems neither extreamly high, nor long,
nor broad, becau&s;e it is all of them in a
ju&s;t Equality. As on the contrary in
our <HI>Gothic</HI> Cathedrals, the Narrowne&s;s
<PB N="133" REF="154">
of the Arch makes it ri&s;e in Height, or
run out in Length; the Lowne&s;s often
opens it in Breadth, or the Defectivene&s;s
of &s;ome other Particular makes any &s;ingle
Part appear in greater Perfection. Tho'
every thing in this Church is admirable,
the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Part of it is the
Cupola. Upon my going to the Top
of it, I was &s;urpriz'd to find that the
Dome, which we &s;ee in the Church, is
not the &s;ame that one looks upon with|out
Doors, the la&s;t of 'em being a kind
of Ca&s;e to the other, and the Stairs lying
betwixt 'em both, by which one a&s;|cends
into the Ball. Had there been
only the outward Dome, it would not
have &s;hewn it &s;elf to an Advantage to
tho&s;e that are in the Church; or had
there only been the inward one, it would
&s;carce have been &s;een by tho&s;e that are
without; had they both been one &s;olid
Dome of &s;o great a Thickne&s;s, the Pil|lars
would have been too weak to have
&s;upported it. after having &s;urvey'd this
Dome, I went to &s;ee the <HI>Rotunda,</HI> which
is generally &s;aid to have been the Mo|del
of it. This Church is at pre&s;ent &s;o
much chang'd from the ancient <HI>Panthe|on,</HI>
as <HI>Pliny</HI> has de&s;crib'd it, that &s;ome
have been inclin'd to think it is not the
&s;ame Temple; but the Cavalier <HI>Fonta|na</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="155">
has abundantly &s;atisfy'd the World in
this Particular, and &s;hewn how the an|cient
Figure, and Ornaments of the <HI>Pan|theon,</HI>
have been chang'd into what they
are at pre&s;ent. This Author, who is
now e&s;teem'd the be&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Architects, has lately written a Treati&s;e
on <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>'s Amphitheater, which is
not yet Printed.</P>
<P>After having &s;een the&s;e Two Ma|&s;ter-pieces
of Modern and Ancient Ar|chitecture,
I have often con&s;ider'd with
my &s;elf whether the ordinary Figure
of the Heathen, or that of the Chri&s;tian
Temples be the mo&s;t beautiful, and the
mo&s;t capable of Magnificence, and can't
forbear thinking the Cro&s;s Figure more
proper for &s;uch &s;pacious Buildings than
the <HI>Rotund.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Eye is
better fill'd at fir&s;t entering the <HI>Rotund,</HI>
and takes in the whole Beauty and Mag|nificence
of the Temple at one view.
But &s;uch as are built in the Form of a
Cro&s;s, give us a greater Variety of No|ble
Pro&s;pects. Nor is it ea&s;ie to conceive
a more glorious Show in Architecture,
than what a Man meets with in St. <HI>Pe|ters,</HI>
when he &s;tands under the Dome.
If he looks upward he is a&s;toni&s;h'd at
the &s;pacious Hollow of the Cupola, and
has a Vault on every &s;ide of him, that
<PB N="135" REF="156">
makes one of the beautifulle&s;t <HI>Vi&s;tas</HI>
that the Eye can po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;s thro'. I
know that &s;uch as are profe&s;s'd Admirers
of the Ancients will find abundance
of Chimerical Beauties, the Archi|tects
them&s;elves never thought of, as
one of the mo&s;t Famous of the Moderns
in that Art tells us, the Hole in the
Roof of the <HI>Rotunda</HI> is &s;o admirably con|triv'd,
that it makes tho&s;e who are in
the Temple look like Angels, by dif|fu&s;ing
the Light equally on all &s;ides
of 'em.</P>
<P>In all the old High-ways, that lead
from <HI>Rome,</HI> one &s;ees &s;everal little Ruins
on each &s;ide of 'em, that were formerly
&s;o many Sepulchres; for the ancient <HI>Ro|mans</HI>

begin often with a <HI>Si&s;te Viator-Viator

Imitation of the old <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;criptions,
that generally addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the

to enter the City, or to go out of it
without pa&s;&s;ing thro' one of the&s;e me|lancholly
Roads, which for a great Length
was nothing el&s;e but a Street of Fune|ral
Monuments.</P>
<P>In my way from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> I
found nothing &s;o remarkable as the
Beauty of the Country, and the extream
Poverty of its Inhabitants. It is indeed
an amazing thing to &s;ee the pre&s;ent De|&s;olation
of <HI>Italy,</HI> when one con&s;iders
what incredible Multitudes of People
it abounded with during the Reigns of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors: And notwith&s;tand|ing
the Removal of the Imperial Seat,
the Irruptions of the Barbarous Nations,
the Civil Wars of this Country, with
the Hard&s;hips of its &s;everal Govern|ments,
one can &s;carce imagine how &s;o
plentiful a Soil &s;hould become &s;o mi&s;e|rably
unpeopled in Compari&s;on of what
it once was. We may reckon, by a
very moderate Computation, more In|habitants
in the <HI>Campania</HI> of Old <HI>Rome,</HI>
than are now in all <HI>Italy.</HI> And if we
could number up tho&s;e prodigious Swarms
that had &s;ettled them&s;elves in every Part
of this delighful Country, I que&s;tion
not but that they would amount to more
than can be found, at pre&s;ent, in any Six
<PB N="137" REF="158">
Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> of the &s;ame Extent.
This De&s;olation appears no where greater
than in the Pope's Territories, and yet
there are &s;everal Rea&s;ons would make
a Man expect to &s;ee the&s;e Domini|ons
the be&s;t regulated, and mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing
of any other in <HI>Europe.</HI> Their
Prince is generally a Man of Learning
and Virtue, mature in Years and Expe|rience,
who has &s;eldom any Vanity or
Plea&s;ure to gratify at his People's Ex|pence,
and is neither encumber'd with
Wife, Children or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; not to
mention the &s;uppos'd Sanctity of his
Character, which obliges him in a more
particular manner to con&s;ult the Good
and Happine&s;s of Mankind. The Di|rection
of Church and State are
lodg'd entirely in his own Hands, &s;o
that his Government is naturally free
from tho&s;e Principles of Faction and Di|vi&s;ion
which are mix'd in the very
Compo&s;ition of mo&s;t others. His Sub|jects
are always ready to fall in with his
De&s;igns, and are more at his Di&s;po&s;al
than any others of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute
Government, as they have a greater Ve|neration
for his Per&s;on, and not only
court his Favour but his Ble&s;&s;ing. His
Country is extreamly fruitful, and has
good Havens both for the Adriatic and
<PB N="138" REF="159">
Mediterranean, which is an Advantage
peculiar to him&s;elf and the <HI>Neapolitans</HI>
above the re&s;t of the <HI>Italians.</HI> There is
&s;till a Benefit the Pope enjoys above all
other Soveraigns, in drawing great Sums
out of <HI>Spain, Germany</HI> and other Coun|tries
that belong to Foreign Princes,
which one would fancy might be no
&s;mall Ea&s;e to his own Subjects. We
may here add, that there is no Place in
<HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much frequented by Strangers,
whether they are &s;uch as come out of
Curio&s;ity, or &s;uch who are obliged to
attend the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> on &s;everal Oc|ca&s;ions,
as are many of the Cardinals and
Prelates, that bring con&s;iderable Sums
into the Pope's Dominions. But not|with&s;tanding
all the&s;e promi&s;ing Cir|cum&s;tances,
and the long Peace that
has reign'd &s;o many years in <HI>Italy,</HI> there
is not a more mi&s;erable People in <HI>Europe</HI>
than the Pope's Subjects. His State is
thin of Inhabitants, and a great Part of
his Soil uncultivated. His Subjects are
wretchedly poor and idle, and have nei|ther
&s;ufficient Manufactures nor Traffick
to employ 'em. The&s;e ill Effects may
ari&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, out of the Ar|bitrarine&s;s
of the Government, but I
think they are chiefly to be a&s;crib'd to
the very Genius of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick
<PB N="139" REF="160">
Religion, which here &s;hews it &s;elf in
its Perfection. It is not &s;trange to find
a Country half unpeopled, where &s;o
great a proportion of the Inhabitants of
both Sexes is ty'd under &s;uch Vows of
Cha&s;tity, and where at the &s;ame time an
Inqui&s;ition forbids all Recruits out
of any other Religion. Nor is it le&s;s
ea&s;y to account for the great Poverty
and Want that are to be met with in a
Country which invites into it &s;uch
Swarms of Vagabonds, under the Title
of Pilgrims, and &s;huts up in Cloi&s;ters &s;uch
an incredible Multitude of young and
lu&s;ty Beggars, who, in&s;tead of encrea|&s;ing
the Common Stock by their La|bour
and Indu&s;try, lye as a dead Weight
on their Fellow Subjects, and con&s;ume
the Charity that ought to &s;upport the
Sickly, Old and Decrepid. The many
Ho&s;pitals, that are every where erected,
&s;erve rather to encourage Idlene&s;s in the
People, than to &s;et 'em at Work; not
to mention the great Riches which lye

<PB N="140" REF="161">
in the Government and Religion, there
ari&s;es among 'em an Avaritious Pope,
who is for making a Family, it is no

Complication of Di&s;tempers. Yet it is
to this Humour of Nepoti&s;m that <HI>Rome</HI>
owes its pre&s;ent Splendor and Magni|ficence,
for it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible
to have furni&s;h'd out &s;o many glo|rious
Palaces with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of
Pictures, Statues, and the like Ornaments,
had not the Riches of the People at
&s;everal times fallen into the Hands of
many different Families, and of particu|lar
Per&s;ons; as we may ob&s;erve, tho'
the Bulk of the <HI>Roman</HI> People was more
rich and happy in the times of the Com|mon-wealth,
the City of <HI>Rome</HI> receiv'd
all its Beauties and Embelli&s;hments under
the Emperors. It is probable the <HI>Cam|pania</HI>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as other Parts of
the Pope's Territories, would be culti|vated
much better than it is, were there
not &s;uch an Exorbitant Tax on Corn,
which makes 'em plow up only &s;uch Spots
of Ground as turn to the mo&s;t Advantage:
Whereas were the Money to be rais'd
on Lands, with an Exception to &s;ome
of the more barren Parts, that might
be Tax-free for a certain Term of Years,
every one would turn his Ground to the
<PB N="141" REF="162">
be&s;t Account, and in a little time per|haps
bring more Money into the Pope's
Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Plea&s;ure I took in my
Journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Naples</HI> was in &s;ee|ing
the Fields, Towns, and Rivers that
have been de&s;crib'd by &s;o many <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic</HI>

&s;o many great Actions; for this whole
Road is extreamly barren of Curio&s;ities.
It is worth while to have an Eye on
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Voyage to <HI>Brundi&s;i,</HI> when one
pa&s;&s;es this way; for by comparing his
&s;everal Stages, and the Road he took,
with tho&s;e that are ob&s;erv'd at pre&s;ent,
we may have &s;ome Idea of the Changes
that have been made in the Face of this
Country &s;ince his Time. If we may
gue&s;s at the common Trevelling of Per|&s;ons
of Quality, among the ancient <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
from this Poet's De&s;cription of his
Voyage, we may conclude they &s;eldom
went above Fourteen Miles a Day over
the <HI>Appian</HI> Way, which was more us'd
by the Noble <HI>Romans</HI> than any other in
<HI>Italy,</HI> as it led to <HI>Naples, Ba&iuml;ae,</HI> and the

<P>_MY Fir&s;t Days at <HI>Naples</HI> were
taken up with the Sight of
Proce&s;&s;ions, which are al|ways
very magnificent in the
Holy-Week. It would be
tedious to give an Account of the &s;eve|ral
Repre&s;entations of our Saviour's
Death and Re&s;urrection, of the Figures
of him&s;elf, the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and the
Apo&s;tles, which are carry'd up and down
on this Occa&s;ion, with the Cruel Penan|ces
that &s;everal inflict on them&s;elves, and
the Multitude of Ceremonies that at|tend
the&s;e Solemnities. I &s;aw, at the
&s;ame time, a very &s;plendid Proce&s;&s;ion for
the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to
the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> in which the Vice-Roy
bore his Part at the Left Hand of
Cardinal <HI>Cantelmi.</HI> To grace the Pa|rade,
they expos'd, at the &s;ame time, the
Blood of St. <HI>Januarius,</HI> which lique|fy'd
at the approach of the Saint's Head,
tho', as they &s;ay, it was hard congeal'd
before. I had twice an Opportunity
of &s;eeing the Operation of this pretended
<PB N="149" REF="170">
Miracle, and mu&s;t confe&s;s I think it &s;o
far, from being a real Miracle, that I
look upon it as one of the mo&s;t Bung|ling
Tricks that I ever &s;aw: Yet it is
this that makes as great a Noi&s;e as any in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and that Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Pa&s;chal</HI> has hinted at among the re&s;t, in
his Marks of the true Religion. The
modern <HI>Neapolitans</HI> &s;eem to have copy'd

One may &s;ee at lea&s;t that the Heathen
Prie&s;thood had the &s;ame kind of Secret
among them, of which the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|tholicks
are now Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, tho' I had liv'd above
a Year in a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Country,
I was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee many Ceremonies
and Super&s;titions in <HI>Naples,</HI> that are not
&s;o much as thought of in <HI>France.</HI> But
as it is certain there has been a kind of
Secret Reformation made, tho' not pub|lickly
own'd, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick
Church, &s;ince the &s;preading of the Pro|te&s;tant
Religion, &s;o we find the &s;everal
Nations are recover'd out of their Ig|norance,
in proportion as they conver&s;e
more or le&s;s with tho&s;e of the Reform'd
Churches. For this Rea&s;on the <HI>French</HI>
are much more enlighten'd than the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Italians,</HI> on occa&s;ion of
their frequent Controver&s;ies with the
<HI>Huguenots</HI>; and we find many of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Gentlemen of our
own Country, who will not &s;tick to
laugh at the Super&s;titions they &s;ometimes
meet with in other Nations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not be particular in de&s;cribing
the Grandeur of the City of <HI>Naples,</HI>
the Beauty of its Pavement, the Regu|larity
of its Buildings, the Magnificence
of its Churches and Convents, the Mul|titude
<PB N="151" REF="172">
of its Inhabitants, or the Delight|fulne&s;s
of its Situation, which &s;o many
others have done with a great deal of
Lei&s;ure and Exactne&s;s. If a War &s;hould
break out, the Town has rea&s;on to ap|prehend
the exacting of a large Contri|bution,
or a Bombardment. It has but
Seven Gallies, a Mole, and Two little
Ca&s;tles, which are capable of hindering
an Enemy's Approaches. Be&s;ides, that
the Sea which lyes near it is not &s;ubject
to Storms, has no &s;en&s;ible Flux and Re|flux,
and is &s;o deep that a Ve&s;&s;el of Bur|den
may come up to the very Mole.
The Hou&s;es are flat Roof'd to walk
upon, &s;o that every Bomb that fell on
them would take Effect.</P>
<P>Pictures, Statues, and Pieces of An|tiquity
are not &s;o common at <HI>Naples,</HI> as
one might expect in &s;o great and anci|ent
a City of <HI>Italy</HI>; for the Vice-Roys
take care to &s;end into <HI>Spain</HI> every thing
that is valuable of this Nature. Two
of their fine&s;t modern Statues are tho&s;e
of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Minerva,</HI> plac'd on each
&s;ide of <HI>Sannazarius</HI>'s Tomb. On the
Face of this Monument, which is all of
Marble, and very neatly wrought, is re|pre&s;ented,
in <HI>Bas relief, Neptune</HI> among
the Satyrs, to &s;how that this Poet was

There are &s;everal very delightful Pro|&s;pects
about <HI>Naples,</HI> e&s;pecially from &s;ome
of the Religious Hou&s;es; for one &s;el|dom
finds in <HI>Italy</HI> a Spot of Ground
more agreeable than ordinary, that is
not cover'd with a Convent. The Cu|pola's
of this City, tho' there are many
of them, don't appear to the be&s;t Ad|vantage
when one &s;urveys them at a di|&s;tance,
as being generally too high and
narrow. The Marquis of <HI>Medina Cido|nia,</HI>
in his Vice-Royalty, made the Shell
of a Hou&s;e, which he had not time to
fini&s;h, that commands a View of the
whole Bay, and would have been a very

Perfection.</P>
<P>It &s;tands &s;o on the &s;ide of a Mountain
that it would have had a Garden to e|very
Story, by the help of a Bridge
which was to have been laid over each
Garden.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Naples</HI> is the mo&s;t delight|ful
one that I ever &s;aw. It lyes in al|mo&s;t
a round Figure of about Thirty
Miles in the Diameter. Three Parts of
it are &s;helter'd with a noble Circuit of
Woods and Mountains. The high Pro|montory
of <HI>Surrentum</HI> divides it from
the Bay of <HI>Salernum.</HI> Between the ut|mo&s;t
Point of this Promontory, and the
<PB N="154" REF="175">
I&s;le of <HI>Caprea,</HI> the Sea enters by a
Streight of about Three Miles wide.
This I&s;land &s;tands as a va&s;t Mole, which
&s;eems to have been planted there on pur|po&s;e
to break the Violence of the Waves
that run into the Bay. It lyes long|ways,
almo&s;t in a parallel Line to <HI>Na|ples.</HI>
The exce&s;&s;ive Height of its Rocks
&s;ecures a great part of the Bay from
Winds and Waves, which enter again
between the other End of this I&s;land
and the Promontory of <HI>Mi&s;eno.</HI> The
Bay of <HI>Naples</HI> is call'd the <HI>Crater</HI> by the
old Geographers, probably from this its
Re&s;emblance to a round Bowl half fill'd
with Liquor. Perhaps <HI>Virgil,</HI> who

<HI>Vitruvius</HI> would have to the Front of his

<P>One would wonder how the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI>
who have but very few Forces in
the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;hould be able
to keep a People from Revolting, that
has been famous for its Mutinies and
Seditions in former Ages. But they
<PB N="156" REF="177">
have &s;o well contriv'd it, that tho' the
Subjects are mi&s;erably hara&s;s'd and op|pre&s;s'd,
the greate&s;t of their Oppre&s;&s;ors
are tho&s;e of their own Body. I &s;hall not
mention any thing of the Clergy, who are
&s;ufficiently reproached in mo&s;t Itinera|ries
for the univer&s;al Poverty that one
meets with in this noble and plentiful
Kingdom. A great Part of the People
is in a State of Va&s;&s;allage to the Barons,
who are the har&s;he&s;t Tyrants in the
World to tho&s;e that are under them.
The Va&s;&s;als indeed are allow'd, and in|vited
to bring in their Complaints and
Appeals to the Vice-Roy, who, to fo|ment
Divi&s;ions, and gain the Hearts of
the Populace, does not &s;tick at Impri|&s;oning
and Cha&s;ti&s;ing their Ma&s;ters ve|ry
&s;everely on occa&s;ion. The Subjects
of the Crown are notwith&s;tanding much
more rich and happy than the Va&s;&s;als
of the Barons. In&s;omuch that when
the King has been upon the point of
&s;elling a Town to one of his Barons,
the Inhabitants have rais'd the Sum up|on
them&s;elves, and pre&s;ented it to the
King, that they might keep out of &s;o
in&s;upportable a Slavery. Another way
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken to grind the
<HI>Neapolitans,</HI> and yet to take off the <HI>O|dium</HI>
from them&s;elves, has been by ere|cting
<PB N="157" REF="178">
&s;everal Courts of Ju&s;tice, with a
very &s;mall Pen&s;ion for &s;uch as fit at the
Head of them, &s;o that they are tempted
to take Bribes, keep Cau&s;es undecided,
encourage Law-&s;uits, and do all they
can to fleece the People, that they may
have wherewithal to &s;upport their own
Dignity. It is incredible how great a
Multitude of Retainers to the Law there
are at <HI>Naples.</HI> It is commonly &s;aid, that
when <HI>Innocent</HI> the Eleventh had de&s;ir'd
the Marquis of <HI>Carpio</HI> to furni&s;h him
with Thirty Thou&s;and Head of Swine,
the Marquis an&s;wer'd him, that for his
Swine he could not &s;pare them, but if
his Holine&s;s had occa&s;ion for Thirty Thou|&s;and
Lawyers he had them at his Service.
The&s;e Gentlemen find a continual Em|ploy
for the fiery Temper of the <HI>Nea|politans,</HI>
and hinder them from uniting
in &s;uch common Friend&s;hips and Allian|ces
as might endanger the Safety of the
Government. There are very few Per|&s;ons
of Con&s;ideration who have not a
Cau&s;e depending; for when a <HI>Neapoli|tan</HI>
Cavalier has nothing el&s;e to do, he
gravely &s;huts him&s;elf up in his Clo&s;et,
and falls a tumbling over his Papers to
&s;ee if he can &s;tart a Law Suit, and
plague any of his Neighbours. So much
is the Genius of this People chang'd &s;ince
<HI>Statius</HI>'s Time.<Q><PB N="158" REF="179">

<P>There is another Circum&s;tance which
makes the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI> in a very particu|lar
manner, the Oppre&s;&s;ors of each other.
The Gables of <HI>Naples</HI> are very high on
Oil, Wine, Tobacco, and indeed on al|mo&s;t
every thing that can be eaten,
drank or worn. There would have been
one on Fruit, had not <HI>Ma&s;&s;ianello</HI>'s Re|bellion
aboli&s;h'd it, as it has probably
put a &s;top to many others. What makes
the&s;e Impo&s;ts more intolerable to the
poorer &s;ort, they are laid on all Butchers
Meat, while at the &s;ame time the Fowl
and Gibier are Tax free. Be&s;ides, all
Meat being Taxed equally by the Pound,
it happens that the Duty lyes heavie&s;t
<PB N="159" REF="180">
on the coar&s;er &s;orts, which are mo&s;t
likely to fall to the &s;hare of the common
People, &s;o that Beef perhaps pays a Third,
and Veal a Tenth of its Price to the
Government, a Pound of either &s;ort ha|ving
the &s;ame Tax fix'd on it. The&s;e
Gabels are mo&s;t of them at pre&s;ent in
the Hands of private Men; for as the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> has had occa&s;ion for Mo|ny
he has borrow'd it of the Rich <HI>Nea|politans,</HI>
on Condition that they &s;hould
receive the Intere&s;t out of &s;uch or &s;uch
Gabels 'till he could repay them the
Principal.</P>
<P>This he has repeated &s;o often that at
pre&s;ent there is &s;carce a &s;ingle Gabel
unmortgag'd; &s;o that there is no Place
in <HI>Europe</HI> which pays greater Taxes,
and at the &s;ame time no Prince who
draws le&s;s Advantage from them. In
other Countries the People have the Sa|tisfaction
of &s;eeing the Mony they give
&s;pent in the Nece&s;&s;ities, Defence, or Or|nament
of their State, or at lea&s;t in the
Vanity or Plea&s;ures of their Prince: but
here mo&s;t of it goes to the enriching
of their Fellow-Subjects. If there was
not &s;o great a Plenty of every thing in
<HI>Naples</HI> the People could not bear it. The
<HI>Spaniard</HI> however reaps this Advantage
from the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of Affairs, that
<PB N="160" REF="181">
the Murmurs of the Peeple are turn'd
upon their own Countrymen, and what
is more con&s;iderable, that almo&s;t all the
Per&s;ons, of the greate&s;t Wealth and
Power in <HI>Naples,</HI> are engag'd by their
own Intere&s;ts to pay the&s;e Impo&s;itions
chearfully, and to &s;upport the Govern|ment
which has laid them on. For this
Rea&s;on, tho' the poorer &s;ort are for the
Emperor, few of the Per&s;ons of Con&s;e|quence
can endure to think of a Change
in their pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment; tho'
there is no que&s;tion but the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> will Reform mo&s;t of the&s;e Abu|&s;es,
by breaking or retrenching the Pow|er
of the Barons, by cancelling &s;everal
unnece&s;&s;ary Employs, or by ran&s;oming or
taking the Gabels into his own Hands. I
have been told too, there is a Law of
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth &s;omething like our Sta|tute
of Mort-main, which has laid dormant
ever &s;ince his Time, and will probably
have new Life put into it under the
Reign of an active Prince. The Inha|bitants
of <HI>Naples</HI> have been always very
notorious for leading a Life of Lazine&s;s
and Plea&s;ure, which I take to ari&s;e part|ly
out of the wonderful Plenty of their
Country, that does not make Labour &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to them, and partly out of the
Temper of their Climate, that relaxes
<PB N="161" REF="182">
the Fibres of their Bodies, and di&s;po&s;es
the People to &s;uch an idle indolent Hu|mour.

<HEAD>THE
ANTIQUITIES
AND
Natural Curio&s;ities
That lye near the
CITY of Naples.</HEAD>
<P>_AT about eight Miles Di&s;tance
from <HI>Naples</HI> lyes a very noble
Scene of Antiquities. What
they call <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Tomb is
the fir&s;t that one meets with
on the Way thither. It is certain this Poet
was bury'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> but I think it is al|mo&s;t
as certain that his Tomb &s;tood on the
other &s;ide of the Town which looks to|wards
<HI>Ve&s;uvio.</HI> By this Tomb is the
Entry into the Grotto of <HI>Pau&s;ilypo.</HI>
The common People of <HI>Naples</HI> believe
it to have been wrought by Magick, and
<PB N="165" REF="186">
that <HI>Virgil</HI> was the Magician; who
is in greater Repute among the <HI>Neapo|litans</HI>
for having made the Grotto, than
the <HI>Aeneid.</HI></P>
<P>If a Man would form to him&s;elf a ju&s;t
Idea of this Place, he mu&s;t fancy a va&s;t
Rock undermin'd from one End to the
other, and a Highway running thro' it,
near as long and as broad as the Mall in
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park. This Subterraneous
Pa&s;&s;age is much mended &s;ince <HI>Seneca</HI>
gave &s;o bad a Character of it. The En|try
at both Ends is higher than the mid|dle
Parts of it, and &s;inks by degrees, to
fling in more Light upon the re&s;t. To|wards
the middle are Two large Fun|nels,
bor'd thro' the Roof of the Grot|to,
to let in Light and fre&s;h Air.</P>
<P>There are no where about the Moun|tain
any va&s;t Heaps of Stones, tho' it is
certain the great Quantities of 'em that
are dug out of the Rock could not ea&s;i|ly
conceal them&s;elves, had they not pro|bably
been con&s;um'd in the Moles and
Buildings of <HI>Naples.</HI> This confirm'd me
in a Conjecture which I made at the
fir&s;t &s;ight of this Subterraneous Pa&s;&s;age,
that it was not at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd &s;o much for
a High-way as for a Quarry of Stone, but
that the Inhabitants, finding a double Ad|vantage
by it, hew'd it into the Form we
<PB N="166" REF="187">
now &s;ee. Perhaps the &s;ame De&s;ign gave
the Original to the <HI>SibyL</HI>'s Grotto, con|&s;idering
the prodigious Multitude of Pa|laces
that &s;tood in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I remember when I was at <HI>Chateau|dun</HI>
in <HI>France</HI> I met with a very curious
Per&s;on, a Member of one of the <HI>Ger|man</HI>
Univer&s;ities. He had &s;tay'd a Day
or Two in the Town longer than ordi|nary,
to take the Mea&s;ures of &s;everal
empty Spaces that had been cut in the
Sides of a neighbouring Mountain.
Some of 'em were &s;upported with Pil|lars
form'd out of the Rock, &s;ome were
made in the Fa&s;hion of Galleries, and
&s;ome not unlike Amphitheaters. The
Gentleman had made to him&s;elf &s;everal
ingenious Hypothe&s;es concerning the
u&s;e of the&s;e Subterraneous Apartments,
and from thenee collected the va&s;t mag|nificence
and Luxury of the ancient
<HI>Chateaudunois.</HI> But upon communicat|ing
his Thoughts on this Subject to one
of the mo&s;t Learned of the Place, he
was not a little &s;urpriz'd to hear that
the&s;e &s;tupendous Works of Art were
only &s;o many Quarries of Free-Stone,
that had been wrought into different
Figures, according as the Veins of it di|rected
the Workmen.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="188">
About Five Miles from the Grotto
of <HI>Pau&s;ilypo</HI> lye the Remains of <HI>Puteoli</HI>
and <HI>Bajae,</HI> in a &s;oft Air and a delicious
Situation.</P>
<P>The Country about 'em, by rea&s;on of
its va&s;t Caverns and Subterraneous Fires,
has been mi&s;erably torn in Pieces by
Earthquakes, &s;o that the whole Face of
it is quite chang'd from what it was for|merly.
The Sea has overwhelm'd a
Multitude of Palaces, which may be &s;een
at the Bottom of the Water in a calm
Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lucrine</HI> Lake is but a Puddle in
Compari&s;on of what it once was, its
Springs having been &s;unk in an Earth|quake,
or &s;topp'd up by Mountains that
have fallen upon 'em. The Lake of <HI>A|vernus,</HI>
formerly &s;o famous for its Steams
of Poi&s;on, is now plentifully &s;tock'd with
Fi&s;h and Fowl. Mount <HI>Gaurus,</HI> from
one of the fruitfulle&s;t Parts in <HI>Italy,</HI> is
become one of the mo&s;t barren. Seve|ral
Fields, which were laid out in beau|tiful
Groves and Gardens, are now na|ked
Plains, &s;moaking with Sulphur, or
encumber'd with Hills that have been
thrown up by Eruptions of Fire. The
Works of Art lye in no le&s;s Di&s;order
than tho&s;e of Nature, for that which
was once the mo&s;t Beautiful Spot of <HI>I|aly,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="189">
cover'd with Temples and Palaces,
adorn'd by the greate&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Common-wealth, embeli&s;h'd by many
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and celebrated
by the be&s;t of their Poets, has now no|thing
to &s;how but the Ruins of its an|cient
Splendor, and a great Magnificence
in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Mole of <HI>Puteoli</HI> has been mi&s;ta|ken
by &s;everal Authors for <HI>Caligula</HI>'s
Bridge. They have all been led into
this Error from the Make of it, becau&s;e
it &s;tands on Arches. But to pa&s;s over
the many Arguments that may be
brought again&s;t this Opinion, I &s;hall here
take away the Foundation of it, by &s;et|ting
down an In&s;cription mention'd by
<HI>Julius Capitolinus</HI> in the Life of <HI>Antoni|nus

Mole. <HI>Imp. Cae&s;ari. Divi. Hadriano. fi|lio.

<P>It would have been very difficult to
have made &s;uch a Mole as this of <HI>Pute|li,</HI>
in a Place where they had not &s;o na|tural
a Commodity as the Earth of <HI>Puz|zuola,</HI>
which immediately hardens in the
<PB N="169" REF="190">
Water, and after a little lying in it looks
rather like Stone than Mortar. It was
this that gave the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> an
Opportunity of making &s;o many En|croachments
on the Sea, and of laying
the Foundations of their Villas and Pa|laces
within the very Borders of it, as
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 2. O. 18. L. 3. O. 1. L. 3. O. 24. Epi&s;t. L. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Horace</HI> has elegantly de&s;cribed it more
than once.</P>
<P>About Four Years ago they dug up a
great Piece of Marble near <HI>Puzzuola,</HI>
with &s;everal Figures and Letters Engra|ven
round it, which have given occa&s;i|on
to &s;ome Di&s;putes among the Antiqua|ries.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Gronovium, Fa bretti, Bulifon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> But they all agree that it is the
Pede&s;tal of a Statue erected to <HI>Tiberius</HI>
by the Fourteen Cities of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which
were flung down by an Earthquake; the
&s;ame that, according to the Opinion of
many Learned Men, happen'd at our
Saviour's Crucifixion. They have found
in the Letters, which are &s;till legible,
the Names of the &s;everal Cities, and di&s;|cover
in each Figure &s;omething particu|lar
to the City, of which it repre&s;ents
the Genius. There are two Medals of
<HI>Tiberius</HI> &s;tamp'd on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion
<PB N="169" REF="191">

It is probable this might have been
the Po&s;ture of the Statue, which in all
likelihood does not lye far from the Place
where they took up the Pede&s;tal; for
they &s;ay there were other great Pieces
of Marble near it, and &s;everal of 'em In|&s;crib'd,
but that no Body would be at
the Charges of bringing them to light.
The Pede&s;tal it &s;elf lay neglected in an
open Field when I &s;aw it. I &s;hall not
be particular on the Ruins of the Am|phitheater,
the ancient Re&s;ervoirs of
Water, the <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto, the <HI>Centum
Camerae,</HI> the Sepulchre of <HI>Agrippina Ne|ro</HI>'s
Mother, with &s;everal other Anti|quities
of le&s;s Note, that lye in the
Neighbourhood of this Bay, and have
been often de&s;crib'd by many others. I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, after having &s;urvey'd the
Antiquities about <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> I
cannot but think that our Admiration of
'em does not &s;o much ari&s;e out of their
Greatne&s;s as Uncommonne&s;s.</P>
<P>There are indeed many extraordinary
Ruins, but I believe a traveller would
not be &s;o much a&s;toni&s;h'd at 'em, did he
find any Works of the &s;ame kind in his
own Country. Amphitheatres, Trium|phal
Arches, Baths, Grotto's, Cata|combs,
Rotunda's, Highways pav'd for
&s;o great a Length, Bridges of &s;uch an
<PB N="172" REF="193">
amazing Height, Subterraneous Build|ings
for the Reception of Rain and
Snow-Water, are mo&s;t of 'em at pre|&s;ent
out of Fa&s;hion, and only to be met
with among the Antiquities of <HI>Italy.</HI>
We are therefore immediately &s;urpriz'd
when we &s;ee any con&s;iderable Sums laid
out in any thing of this Nature, tho'
at the &s;ame time there is many a <HI>Gothic</HI>
Cathedral in <HI>England,</HI> that has co&s;t
more Pains and Mony than &s;everal of
the&s;e celebrated Works. Among the
Ruins of the old Heathen Temples they
&s;how'd me what they call the Chamber
of <HI>Venus,</HI> which &s;tands a little behind
her Temple. It is wholly dark, and has
&s;everal Figures on the Cieling wrought
in <HI>Stucco,</HI> that &s;eem to repre&s;ent Lu&s;t and
Strength by the Emblems of naked <HI>Ju|piters</HI>
and <HI>Gladiators, Tritons</HI> and <HI>Cen|taurs,</HI>
&amp;c. &s;o that one would gue&s;s it
has formerly been the Scene of many
lewd My&s;teries. On the other &s;ide of
<HI>Naples</HI> are the Catacombs. The&s;e mu&s;t
have been full of Stench and Loath&s;om|ne&s;s,
if the dead Bodies that lay in 'em
were left to rot in open Nitches, as an
Eminent Author of our own Country
Imagine's. But upon examining 'em I
find they were each of 'em &s;top'd up:
<PB N="173" REF="194">
without doubt, as &s;oon as the Corps
was laid in it. For at the Mouth of the
Nitch one always finds the Rock cut in|to
little Channels, to fa&s;ten the Board
or Marble that was to clo&s;e it up, and I
think I did not &s;ee one which had not
&s;till &s;ome Mortar &s;ticking in it. In &s;ome
I found pieces of Tiles that exactly tal|ly'd
with the Channel, and in others a
little Wall of Bricks, that &s;ometimes
&s;topp'd up above a quarter of the Nitch,
the re&s;t having been broken down. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The Natural Curio&s;ities about <HI>Naples</HI>
are as numerous and extraordinary as the
Artificial. I &s;hall &s;et them down, as I
have done the other, without any re|gard
to their Situation. The Grotto
<HI>del Cani</HI> is famous for the poi&s;onous
Steams which float within a Foot of its
Surface. The Sides of the Grotto are
mark'd with Green, as high as the Ma|lignity
of the Vapour reaches. The com|mon
Experiments are as follow: A Dog,
that has his No&s;e held in the Vapour,
lo&s;es all Signs of Life in a very little
time; but if carry'd into the open Air,
or thrown into a Neighbouring Lake,
he immediately recovers, if he is not
<PB N="176" REF="197">
quite gone. A Torch, Snuff and all,
goes out in a Moment when dipp'd in|to
the Vapour. A Pi&s;tol cannot take Fire
in it. I &s;plit a Reed, and laid in the
Channel of it a Train of Gun-powder,
&s;o that one End of the Reed was above
the Vapour, and the other at the Bot|tom
of it; and I found, tho' the Steam
was &s;trong enough to hinder a Pi&s;tol
from taking Fire in it, and to quench a
lighted Torch, that it could not inter|cept
the Train of Fire when it had once
begun Fla&s;hing, nor hinder it from run|ning
to the very End. This Experiment
I repeated twice or thrice, to &s;ee if I
could quite di&s;&s;ipate the Vapour, which
I did in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, that one
might ea&s;ily let off a Pi&s;tol in it. I ob|&s;erv'd
how long a Dog was in Expiring
the fir&s;t time, and after his Recovery,
and found no &s;en&s;ible difference. A Vi|per
bore it Nine Minutes the fir&s;t time
we put it in, and Ten the Second. When
we brought it out after the fir&s;t Trial,
it took &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of Air into
its Lungs, that it &s;well'd almo&s;t twice
as big as before; and it was perhaps on
this Stock of Air that it liv'd a Minute
longer the &s;econd time. Doctor <HI>Connor</HI>
made a Di&s;cour&s;e in one of the Acade|mies
at <HI>Rome</HI> upon the Subject of this
<PB N="177" REF="198">
Grotto, which he has &s;ince Printed in
<HI>England.</HI> He attributes the Death of A|nimals,
and the Extinction of Lights, to
a great Rarefaction of the Air, caus'd
by the Heat and Eruption of the Steams.
But how is it po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e Steams,
tho' in never &s;o great quantity, to re&s;i&s;t
the Pre&s;&s;ure of the whole Atmo&s;phere?
And as for the Heat, it is but very in|con&s;iderable.
However, to &s;atisfie my
&s;elf, I plac'd a thin Viol, well &s;topp'd
up with Wax, within the Smoak of
the Vapour, which would certainly have
bur&s;t in an Air rarefy'd enough to kill
a Dog, or quench a Torch, but nothing
follow'd upon it. However, to take a|way
all further Doubt, I borrow'd a
Weather-gla&s;s, and &s;o fix'd it in the
Grotto, that the <HI>Stagnum</HI> was wholly
cover'd with the Vapour, but I could
not perceive the Quick&s;ilver &s;unk after
half an Hour's &s;tanding in it. This Va|pour
is generally &s;uppos'd to be Sul|phureous,
tho' I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on for
&s;uch a Suppo&s;ition. He that dips his
Hand in it finds no Smell that it leaves
upon it; and tho' I put a whole Bun|dle
of lighted Brim&s;tone Matches to the
Smoak, they all went out in an In&s;tant,
as if immers'd in Water. Whatever is
the Compo&s;ition of the Vapour, let it
<PB N="178" REF="199">
have but one Quality of being very
Glewy or Vi&s;cous, and I believe it will
mechanicaly &s;olve all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
of the Grotto. It's Unctuou&s;ne&s;s will
make it heavy, and unfit for mounting
higher than it does, unle&s;s the Heat of
the Earth, which is ju&s;t &s;trong enough
to agitate, and bear it up at a little di|&s;tance
from the Surface, were much grea|ter
than it is to rarifie and &s;catter it. It
will be too gro&s;s and thick to keep the
Lungs in play for any time, &s;o that A|nimals
will die in it &s;ooner or later, as
their Blood Circulates &s;lower or fa&s;ter.
Fire will live in it no longer than in
Water, becau&s;e it wraps it &s;elf in the
&s;ame manner about the Flame, and by
its Continuity hinders any quantity of
Air or Nitre from coming to its Suc|cour.
The Parts of it however are not
&s;o compact as tho&s;e of Liquors, nor
therefore tenacious enough to intercept
the Fire that has once caught a Train
of Gun-Powder, for which Rea&s;on they
may be quite broken and di&s;pers'd by the
Repetition of this Experiment. There
is an unctuous clammy Vapour that a|ri&s;es
from the Stum of Grapes, when
they lye ma&s;h'd together in the Vat,
which puts out a Light when dipp'd
into it, and perhaps would take away
<PB N="179" REF="200">
the Breath of weaker Animals, were it
put to the Trial.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to reckon up the
different Baths, to be met with in a Coun|try
that &s;o much abounds in Sulphur.
There is &s;carce a Di&s;ea&s;e which has not
one adapted to it. A Stranger is gene|rally
led into that they call <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Bath,
and &s;everal Voyage-Writers pretend
there is a cold Vapour ri&s;ing from the
Bottom of it, which refre&s;hes tho&s;e
who &s;toop into it. 'Tis true the Heat
is much more &s;upportable to one that
&s;toops, than to one that &s;tands upright,
becau&s;e the Steams of Sulphur gather
in the Hollow of the Arch about
a Man's Head, and are therefore
much thicker and warmer in that
Part than at the Bottom. The Three
Lakes of <HI>Agnano, Avernus,</HI> and the <HI>Lu|crin,</HI>
have now nothing in them particu|lar.
The <HI>Monte Novo</HI> was thrown out
by an Eruption of Fire, that happen'd
in the Place where now the Mountain
&s;tands. The <HI>Sulfatara</HI> is very &s;urpri&s;ing
to one who has not &s;een Mount <HI>Ve&s;uvio.</HI>
But there is nothing about <HI>Naples,</HI> nor
indeed in any Part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which de|&s;erves
our Admiration &s;o much as this
Mountain. I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Idea I
had of it, did not an&s;wer the real Image
<PB N="180" REF="201">
of the Place when I came to &s;ee it; I
&s;hall therefore give the De&s;cription of
it as it then lay.</P>
<P>This Mountain &s;tands at about Six
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles di&s;tance from <HI>Naples,</HI> tho'
by rea&s;on of its Height, it &s;eems much
nearer to tho&s;e that &s;urvey it from the
Town. In our Way to it we pa&s;s'd by
what was one of tho&s;e Rivers of burn|ing
Matter, that ran from it in a late E|ruption.
This looks at a di&s;tance like a
new plow'd Land, but, as you come
near it you &s;ee nothing but a long Heap
of heavy disjointed Clods lying one up|on
another. There are innumerable Ca|vities
and Inter&s;tices among the &s;everal
Pieces, &s;o that the Surface is all broken
and irregular. Sometimes a great Frag|ment
&s;tands like a Rock above the re&s;t,
&s;ometimes the whole Heap lyes in a
kind of Channel, and in other Places
has nothing like Banks to confine it,
but ri&s;es Four or Five Foot high in the
open Air, without &s;preading abroad on
either &s;ide. This, I think, is a plain
Demon&s;tration that the&s;e Rivers were
not as they are u&s;ually repre&s;ented, &s;o
many Streams of running Matter; for
how could a Liquid, that lay hardening
by degrees, &s;ettle in &s;uch a furrow'd un|compact
Surface? Were the River a
<PB N="181" REF="202">
Confu&s;ion of never &s;o many different
Bodies, if they had been all actually di&s;|&s;olved,
they would at lea&s;t have form'd
one continu'd Cru&s;t, as we &s;ee the <HI>Sco|rium</HI>
of Metals always gathers into a &s;o|lid
Piece, let it be compounded of a Thou|&s;and
Heterogeneous Parts. I am apt to
think therefore, that the&s;e huge unwiel'dy
Lumps that now lye one upon another,
as if thrown together by Accident, re|main'd
in the melted Matter rigid and
unliquify'd, floating in it like Cakes of
Ice in a River, and that, as the Fire and
Ferment gradually abated, they adju&s;ted
them&s;eves together as well as their irre|gular
Figures would permit, and by this
means fell into &s;uch an interrupted di&s;|orderly
Heap, as we now find it. What
was the melted Matter lyes at the Bot|tom
out of &s;ight. After having quitted
the Side of this long Heap, which was
once a Stream of Fire, we came to the
Roots of the Mountain, and had a very
trouble&s;ome March to gain the Top of
it. It is cover'd on all Sides with a kind
of burnt Earth, very dry, and crumbled
into Powder, as if it had been artifici|ally
&s;ifted. It is very hot under the Feet,
and mix'd with &s;everal burnt Stones and
Cakes of Cinders, which have been
thrown out at different times. A Man
<PB N="182" REF="203">
&s;inks almo&s;t a Foot in the Earth, and
generally lo&s;es half a Step by &s;liding
backwards. When we had climb'd this
Mountain we di&s;cover'd the Top of it
to be a wide naked Plain, &s;moaking with
Sulphur in &s;everal Places, and probably
undermin'd with Fire, for we conclu|ded
it to be hollow by the Sound it
made under our Feet. In the mid&s;t of
this Plain &s;tands a high Hill in the &s;hape
of a Sugar-loaf, &s;o very &s;teep that there
would be no mounting or de&s;cending it,
were not it made up of &s;uch a loo&s;e
crumbled Earth as I have before de&s;cri|bed.
The Air of this Place mu&s;t be
very much impregnated with Salt-peter,
as appears by the Specks of it on the
Sides of the Mountain, where one can
&s;carce find a Stone that has not the Top
white with it. After we had, with
much ado, conquer'd this Hill, we &s;aw
in the mid&s;t of it the pre&s;ent Mouth of
<HI>Ve&s;uvio,</HI> that goes &s;helving down on all
Sides 'till above a Hundred Yards deep,
as near as we could gue&s;s, and has about
Three or Four Hundred in the Diame|ter,
for it &s;eems a perfect Round. This
va&s;t Hollow is generally fill'd with
Smoak, but, by the Advantage of a
Wind that blew for us, we had a very
clear and di&s;tinct &s;ight of it. The Sides
<PB N="183" REF="204">
appear all over &s;tain'd with Mixtures of
White, Green, Red and Yellow, and
have &s;everal Rocks &s;tanding out of
them that look like pure Brim&s;tone.
The Bottom was entirely cover'd, and
tho' we look'd very narrowly we could
&s;ee nothing like a Hole in it; the Smoak
breaking through &s;everal imperceptible
Cracks in many Places. The very Mid|dle
was firm Ground when we &s;aw it,
as we concluded from the Stones we
flung upon it, and I que&s;tion not but
one might then have cro&s;s'd the Bottom,
and have gone up on the other Side of
it with very little Danger, unle&s;s from
&s;ome accidental Breath of Wind. In
the late Eruptions this great Hollow
was like a va&s;t Caldron fill'd with
glowing and melted Matter, which, as
it boil'd over in any Part, ran down the
Sides of the Mountain, and made Five
&s;uch Rivers as that before-mention'd.
In proportion as the Heat &s;lacken'd, this
burning Matter mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;ided with|in
the Bowels of the Mountain, and as
it &s;unk very lei&s;urely had time to Cake
together, and form the Bottom which
covers the Mouth of that dreadful Vault
that lyes underneath it. The next E|ruption
or Earthquake will probably
break in Pieces this fal&s;e Bottom, and
<PB N="184" REF="205">
quite change the pre&s;ent Face of
Things.</P>
<P>This whole Mountain, &s;haped like a
Sugar-loaf, has been made at &s;everal
times, by the prodigious Quantities of
Earth and Cinders, which have been
flung up out of the Mouth that lyes in
the mid&s;t of them, &s;o that it encrea&s;es in
Bulk at every Eruption, the A&s;hes &s;till
falling down the Sides of it, like the
Sand in an Hour-Gla&s;s. A Gentleman
of <HI>Naples</HI> told me, that in his Memo|ry
it had gain'd Twenty Foot in Thick|ne&s;s,
and I que&s;tion not but in length of
time it will cover the whole Plain, and
make one Mountain with that on which
it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Parts of the Sea, that are not
far from the Roots of this Mountain,
they find &s;ometimes a very fragrant Oil,
which is &s;old dear, and makes a rich Per|fume.
The Surface of the Sea is, for a
little Space, cover'd with its Bubbles
during the time that it ri&s;es, which they
skim off into their Boats, and afterwards
&s;et a &s;eparating in Pots and Jars. They
&s;ay its Sources never run but in a calm
warm Weather. The Agitations of the
Water perhaps hinder them from di&s;|covering
it at other times.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="206">
Among the Natural Curio&s;ities of <HI>Na|ples,</HI>
I cannot forbear mentioning their
manner of furni&s;hing the Town with
Snow, which they here u&s;e in&s;tead of
Ice, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, it cools or
congeals any Liquor &s;ooner. There is
a great Quantity of it con&s;um'd yearly,
for they drink very few Liquors, not
&s;o much as Water, that have not lain
in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> and every Body, from the
highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, makes u&s;e of it;
in&s;omuch that a Scarcity of Snow would
rai&s;e a Mutiny at <HI>Naples,</HI> as much as a
Dearth of Corn or Provi&s;ions in another
Country. To prevent this the King
has &s;old the Monopoly of it to certain
Per&s;ons, who are oblig'd to furni&s;h the
City with it all the Year at &s;o much
the Pound. They have a high Moun|tain
at about Eighteen Miles from the
Town, which has &s;everal Pits dug into
it. Here they employ many poor Peo|ple
at &s;uch a Sea&s;on of the Year to roll
in va&s;t Balls of Snow, which they ram
together, and cover from the Sun-&s;hine.
Out of the&s;e Re&s;ervoirs of Snow they
cut &s;everal Lumps, as they have occa&s;i|on
for them, and &s;end them on A&s;&s;es to
the Sea-&s;ide, where they are carry'd off
in Boats, and di&s;tributed to &s;everal Shops
at a &s;ettled Price, that from time to time
<PB N="186" REF="207">
&s;upply the whole City of <HI>Naples.</HI> While
the <HI>Banditti</HI> continu'd their Di&s;orders
in this Kingdom, they often put the
Snow-Merchants under Contribution,
and threaten'd them, if they appear'd
tardy in their Payments, to de&s;troy their
Magazines, which they &s;ay might ea&s;ily
have been effected by the Infu&s;ion of &s;ome
Barrels of Oil.</P>
<P>It would have been tedious to have
put down the many De&s;criptions that

the Bi&s;hop's Palace, and Two or Three
Convents. In the mid&s;t of this fruitful
Tract of Land ri&s;es a Hill, that was
probably cover'd with Buildings in <HI>Ti|berius</HI>'s
Time. There are &s;till &s;everal
Ruins on the Sides of it, and about the
Top are found Two or Three dark Gal|leries
low built, and cover'd with Ma|&s;on's
Work, tho' at pre&s;ent they appear
over-grown with Gra&s;s. I enter'd one
of 'em that is a Hundred Paces in Length.
I ob&s;erved, as &s;ome of the Countrymen
were digging into the Sides of this
Mountain, that what I took for &s;olid
Earth was only Heaps of Brick, Stone,
and other Rubbi&s;h, skinn'd over with a
Covering of Vegetables. But the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable Ruin is that which &s;tands
on the very Extremity of the Ea&s;tern
Promontory, where are &s;till &s;ome Apart|ments
left, very high and arch'd at Top.
I have not indeed &s;een the Remains of
any ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings, that have
<PB N="194" REF="215">
not been Roof'd with either Vaults or
Arches. The Rooms I am mentioning
&s;tand deep in the Earth, and have no|thing
like Windows or Chimnies, which
makes me think they were formerly ei|ther
Bathing Places or Re&s;ervoirs of
Water. An old Hermit lives at pre&s;ent
among the Ruins of this Palace, who
lo&s;t his Companion a few Years ago by
a Fall from the Precipice. He told me
they had often found Medals and Pipes
of Lead, as they dug among the Rub|bi&s;h,
and that not many Years ago they
di&s;cover'd a pav'd Road running under
Ground, from the Top of the Moun|tain
to the Sea-&s;ide, which was after|wards
confirm'd to me by a Gentleman
of the I&s;land. There is a very noble
Pro&s;pect from this Place. On the one
&s;ide lyes a va&s;t Extent of Seas, that runs
abroad further than the Eye can reach.
Ju&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;tands the Green Promon|tory
of <HI>Surrentum,</HI> and on the other &s;ide
the whole Circuit of the Bay of <HI>Naples.</HI>
This Pro&s;pect, according to <HI>Tacitus,</HI>
was more agreeable before the burning
of <HI>Ve&s;uvio</HI>; that Mountain probably,
which after the fir&s;t Eruption look'd
like a great Pile of A&s;hes, was in <HI>Tibe|rius</HI>'s

was its whol&s;ome Air, which is warm

inacce&s;&s;ible Coa&s;ts, which are generally
&s;o very &s;teep, that a handful of Men
might defend 'em again&s;t a powerful

<P>We need not doubt but <HI>Tiberius</HI> had

The whole I&s;land was probably
cut into &s;everal ea&s;ie A&s;cents, planted
with Variety of Palaces, and adorn'd
with as great a Multitude of Groves
and Gardens as the Situation of the Place
would &s;uffer. The Works under Ground
were however more extraordinary than
tho&s;e above it: For the Rocks were all
undermin'd with High-ways, Grotto's,
<PB N="199" REF="220">
Galleries, Bagnio's, and &s;everal Subter|raneous
Retirements, that &s;uited with
the Brutal Plea&s;ures of the Emperor.
One would indeed very much wonder to
&s;ee &s;uch &s;mall Appearances of the many

met with in this I&s;land, were we not
told that the <HI>Romans,</HI> after the Death

<P>In &s;ailing round <HI>Caprea</HI> we were en|tertain'd
with many rude Pro&s;pects of
Rocks and Precipices, that ri&s;e in
&s;everal Places half a Mile high in
Perpendicular. At the Bottom of 'em
are Caves and Grotto's, form'd by the
continual breaking of the Waves upon
'em. I enter'd one which the Inhabi|tants
call <HI>Grotto O&s;curo,</HI> and after the
Light of the Sun was a little worn off
my Eyes, could &s;ee all the Parts of it
di&s;tinctly, by a glimmering Reflection
that play'd upon 'em from the Surface
of the Water. The Mouth is low and
narrow, but, after having enter'd pretty
far in, the Grotto opens it &s;elf on both
Sides in an oval Figure of an Hundred
Yeads from one Extremity to the other,
as we were toln, for it would not have
<PB N="200" REF="221">
been &s;afe mea&s;uring of it. The Roof
is vaulted, and Di&s;tils fre&s;h Water from
every Part of it, which fell upon us as
fa&s;t as the fir&s;t Droppings of a Shower.
The Inhabitants and <HI>Neapolitans</HI> who
have heard of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Grotto's, will
have this to be one of 'em, but there
are &s;everal Rea&s;ons that &s;how it to be na|tural.

<P>I have before &s;aid that they often find

none of the Antiquaries that have writ|ten
on this Subject, and find nothing &s;a|tisfactory
of it where I thought it mo&s;t
likely to be met with, in <HI>Patin</HI>'s Edi|tion
of <HI>Suetonius</HI> illu&s;trated by Medals.
Tho&s;e I have convers'd with about it,
are of Opinion they were made to ridi|cule
the Brutality of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> tho' I
cannot but believe they were &s;tamp'd by
his Order. They are unque&s;tionably An|tique,
and no bigger than Medals of the
Third Magnitude. They bear on one
Side &s;ome lewd Invention of that Hel|li&s;h
Society which <HI>Suetonius</HI> calls <HI>Mon|&s;tro&s;i
concubit&ucirc;s repertores,</HI> and on the o|ther
the Number of the Medal. I have
&s;een of 'em as high as to Twenty. I can't
<PB N="202" REF="223">
think they were made as a Je&s;t on the
Emperor, becau&s;e Raillery on Coins is
of a Modern Date. I know but Two
in the Upper Empire, be&s;ides the <HI>Spin|triae,</HI>
that lye under any Su&s;picion of it.
The fir&s;t is one of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI>
where, in Compliment to the Emperor
and Empre&s;s, they have &s;tamp'd on the

<P>This unluckily brings to Mind <HI>Fau|&s;tina</HI>'s

and the Empire torn in Pieces by

con&s;iders the &s;trange Stupidity of this Em|peror,
with the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Security which
<PB N="204" REF="225">

&s;till left on Record, one may very well
believe this Coin was of his own Inven|tion.
We may be &s;ure, if Raillery had
once enter'd the old <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, we
&s;hould have been over-&s;tock'd with Me|dals
of that Nature; if we con&s;ider
there were often Rival Emperors pro|claim'd

at the le&s;&s;ening of each others

were never current Mony, but ra|ther
of the Nature of Medalions, which
&s;eem to have been made on purpo&s;e to
perpetuate the Di&s;coveries of that infa|mous
Society. <HI>Suetonius</HI> tells us, that

rea&s;on of its Eruptions of Fire. There
has been no Eruption for near the&s;e
Three Hundred Years. The la&s;t was
very terrible, and de&s;troy'd a whole Ci|ty.
At pre&s;ent there are &s;carce any Marks
left of a Subterraneous Fire, for the Earth
is cold, and over-run with Gra&s;s and
Shrubs, where the Rocks will &s;uffer it.
There are indeed &s;everal little Cracks in
it, thro' which there i&s;&s;ues a con&s;tant
Smoke, but 'tis probable this ari&s;es from
the warm Springs that feed the many
Baths with which this I&s;land is plenti|fully
&s;tock'd. I ob&s;erv'd, about one of
the&s;e Breathing Pa&s;&s;ages, a Spot of Myr|tles
that flouri&s;h within the Steam of

<P>Among other Subterraneous Works
there is the beginning of a Pa&s;&s;age,
which is &s;topp'd up within le&s;s than a
Hundred Yards of the Entrance, by
the Earth that is fallen into it. They
&s;uppo&s;e it to have been the other Mouth
of the <HI>Sibyl</HI>'s Grotto. It lyes indeed in
the &s;ame Line with the Entrance near
the <HI>Avernus,</HI> is fac'd alike with the <HI>O|pus
Reticulatum,</HI> and has &s;till the Marks
<PB N="216" REF="237">
of Chambers that have been cut into
the Sides of it. Among the many Fa|bles
and Conjectures which have been
made on this Grotto, I think it is high|ly
probable, that it was once inhabited
by &s;uch as perhaps thought it a better
Shelter again&s;t the Sun than any other
kind of Building, or at lea&s;t that it was
made with &s;maller Trouble and Expence.
As for the Mo&s;aic, and other Works
that may be found in it, they may very
well have been added in later Ages, ac|cording
as they thought fit to put the
Place to different U&s;es. The Story of
the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> is indeed clogg'd with
Improbabilities, as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates it, but
it is very likely there was in it &s;ome
Foundation of Truth. <HI>Homer</HI>'s De&s;cri|ption

<P>We touch'd next at <HI>Monte Circeio</HI>
which <HI>Homer</HI> calls <HI>In&s;ula Ae&euml;a,</HI> whether
it be that it was formerly an I&s;land, or
that the <HI>Greek</HI> Sailors of his Time thought
it &s;o. It is certain they might ea&s;ily
have been deceived by its appearance, as
being a very high Mountain join'd to
the main Land by a narrow Tract of
Earth, that is many Miles in Length, and
almo&s;t of a Level with the Surface of
the Water. The End of this Promon|tory
is very rocky, and mightily expos'd
to the Winds and Waves, which per|haps
gave the fir&s;t Ri&s;e to the Howl|ings
of Wolves, and the Roarings of Li|nos,

<P><HI>Virgil</HI> calls this Promontory <HI>Ae&euml;ae In|&s;ula
Circes</HI> in the Third <HI>Aeneid,</HI> but 'tis
<PB N="222" REF="243">
the Heroe, and not the Poet that &s;peaks.
It may however be look'd upon as an
Intimation, that he him&s;elf thought it
an I&s;land in <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Time. As for the
thick Woods, which not only <HI>Virgil</HI>
but <HI>Homer</HI> mentions, in the beautiful
De&s;cription that <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Longinus</HI>
have taken notice of, they are mo&s;t of
'em grubb'd up &s;ince the Promontory
has been cultivated and inhabited, tho'
there are &s;till many Spots of it which
&s;how the natural Inclination of the Soil
leans that way.</P>
<P>The next Place we touch'd upon was
<HI>Nettuno,</HI> where we found nothing re|markable
be&s;ides the extream Poverty
and Lazine&s;s of the Inhabitans. At Two
Miles di&s;tance from it lye the Ruins of
<HI>Antium,</HI> that are &s;pread over a great
Circuit of Land. There are &s;till left the
Foundations of &s;everal Buildings, and
what are always the la&s;t Parts that peri&s;h
in a Ruin, many Subterraneous Grotto's
and Pa&s;&s;ages of a great Length. The
Foundations of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Port are &s;till to
be &s;een. It was altogether Artificial,
and compos'd of huge Moles running
round it, in a kind of Circular Figure,
except where the Ships were to enter,
and had about Three Quarters of a Mile
in its &s;horte&s;t Diameter. Tho' the mak|ing
<PB N="223" REF="244">
of this Port mu&s;t have co&s;t prodigious
Sums of Mony, we find no Medal of it,
and yet the &s;ame Emperor has a Medal
&s;truck in his own Name for the Port of
<HI>O&s;tia,</HI> which in Reality was a Work of
his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Claudius.</HI> The la&s;t Pope
was at con&s;iderable Charges to make a
little kind of Harbour in this Place, and
to convey fre&s;h Water to it, which was
one of the Artifices of the Grand Duke,
to divert his Holine&s;s from his Project
of making <HI>Civita-vecchia</HI> a free Port.
There lyes between <HI>Antium</HI> and <HI>Nettu|no</HI>
a Cardinal's <HI>Villa,</HI> which is one of
the plea&s;ante&s;t for Walks, Fountains,
Shades, and Pro&s;pects that I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><HI>Antium</HI> was formerly famous for the
Temple of Fortune that &s;tod in it. All
agree there were Two Fortunes wor&s;hip|ped
here, which <HI>Suetonius</HI> calls the <HI>Fortunae
Antiates,</HI> and <HI>Martial</HI> the <HI>Sorores Antii.</HI>
Some are of Opinion, that by the&s;e Two
Godde&s;&s;es were meant the Two <HI>Neme&s;es</HI>
one of which rewarded good Men, as
the other puni&s;h'd the wicked. <HI>Fabretti</HI>
and others are apt to believe, that by
the Two Fortunes were only meant in
general the Godde&s;s who &s;ent Pro&s;perity,
or &s;he who &s;ent Afflictions to Mankind,
and produce in their Behalf an ancient
<PB N="224" REF="245">
Monument found in this very Place, and
&s;uper&s;crib'd <HI>Fortunae Felici,</HI> which indeed
may favour one Opinion as well as the
other, and &s;hows at lea&s;t they are not
mi&s;taken in the general Sen&s;e of their
Divi&s;ion. I don't know whether any
Body has taken notice, that this double
Function of the Godde&s;s gives a con&s;i|derable
Light and Beauty to the Ode
which <HI>Horace</HI> has addre&s;s'd to her. The
whole Poem is a Prayer to Fortune, that
&s;he would pro&s;per <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Arms, and
confound his Enemies, &s;o that each of
the Godde&s;&s;es has her Task a&s;&s;ign'd in
the Poet's Prayer; and we may ob&s;erve
the Invocation is divided between the
Two Deities, the fir&s;t Line relating in|differently
to either. That which I have
mark'd &s;peaks to the Godde&s;s of Pro&s;pe|rity,
or if you plea&s;e to the <HI>Neme&s;is</HI> of
the Good, and the other to the Godde&s;s
of Adver&s;ity, or to the <HI>Neme&s;is</HI> of the
Wicked.<Q><L>O Diva gratum quae regis Antium,</L>

<P>If we take the fir&s;t Interpretation of

<HEAD>ROME.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is generally ob&s;erv'd, that
Modern <HI>Rome</HI> &s;tands higher
than the Ancient; &s;ome have
computed it about Fourteen
or Fifteen Feet, taking one
Place with another. The Rea&s;on given
for it is, that the pre&s;ent City &s;tands up|on
the Ruins of the former, and indeed
I have often ob&s;erved, that where any
con&s;iderable Pile of Building &s;tood an|ciently
one &s;till finds a ri&s;ing Ground,
or a little kind of Hill, which was doubt|le&s;s
made up out of the Fragments and
Rubbi&s;h of the ruin'd Edifice. But be|&s;ides
this particular Cau&s;e, we may a&s;&s;ign
another that has very much contributed
to the rai&s;ing the Situation of &s;everal
Parts of <HI>Rome</HI>: It being certain the great
Quantities of Earth, that have been
wa&s;h'd off from the Hills by the Vio|lence
of Showers, have had no &s;mall
&s;hare in it. This any one may be &s;en&s;i|ble
of who ob&s;erves how far &s;everal
Buildings, that &s;tand near the Roots of
Mountains, are &s;unk deeper in the Earth
<PB N="231" REF="252">
than tho&s;e that have been on the Tops
of Hills, or in open Plains; for which
Rea&s;on the pre&s;ent Face of <HI>Rome</HI> is much
more Even and Level than it was for|merly;
the &s;ame Cau&s;e that has rais'd
the lower Grounds having contributed
to &s;ink tho&s;e that were higher.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Rome</HI> Two Setts of
Antiquities, the Chri&s;tian and the Hea|then.
The former, tho' of a fre&s;her
Date, are &s;o embroil'd with Fable and
Legend, that one receives but little Sa|tisfaction
from &s;earching into them. The
other give a great deal of Plea&s;ure to
&s;uch as have met with them before in
ancient Authors; for a Man who is in
<HI>Rome</HI> can &s;carce &s;ee an Object that does
not call to Mind a Piece of a <HI>Latin</HI> Po|et
or Hi&s;torian. Among the Remains
of Old <HI>Rome,</HI> the Grandeur of the Com|mon-wealth
&s;hows it &s;elf chiefly in Works
that were either nece&s;&s;ary or convenient,
&s;uch as Temples, High-ways, Aqueducts,
Walls and Bridges of the City. On
the contrary the Magnificence of <HI>Rome,</HI>
under the Emperors, is &s;een principally
in &s;uch Works as were rather for O|&s;tentation
or Luxury, than any real U&s;e|fulne&s;s
or Nece&s;&s;ity, as in Baths, Am|phitheaters,
Circus's, Obelisks, Trium|phant
Pillars, Arches and Mau&s;oleums;
<PB N="232" REF="253">
for what they added to the Aqueducts
was rather to &s;upply their Baths and Nau|machias,
and to embelli&s;h the City with
Fountains, than out of any real Nece&s;&s;i|ty
there was for them. The&s;e &s;everal
Remains have been &s;o copiou&s;ly de&s;crib'd
by abundance of Travellers, and other
Writers, particularly by tho&s;e concern'd
in the learned Collection of <HI>Graevius,</HI> that
it is very difficult to make any new Di&s;|coveries
on &s;o beaten a Subject. There
is however &s;o much to be ob&s;erv'd in &s;o
&s;pacious a Field of Antiquities, that it
is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;urvey them with|out
taking new Hints, and rai&s;ing diffe|rent
Reflections, according as a Mans na|tural
Turn of Thoughts, or the Cour&s;e
of his Studies, direct him.</P>
<P>No Part of the Antiquities of <HI>Rome</HI>
pleas'd me &s;o much as the ancient Sta|tues,
of which there is &s;till an incredi|ble
Variety. The Workman&s;hip is of|ten
the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of any thing in
its kind. A Man would wonder how
it were po&s;&s;ible for &s;o much Life to en|ter
into Marble, as may be di&s;cover'd in
&s;ome of the be&s;t of them; and even in
the meane&s;t one has the Satisfaction of
&s;eeing the Faces, Po&s;tures, Airs and
Dre&s;s of tho&s;e that have liv'd &s;o many
Ages before us. There is a &s;trange Re|&s;emblance
<PB N="233" REF="254">
between the Figures of the
&s;everal Heathen Deities, and the De&s;cri|ptions
that the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have given
us of them; but as the fir&s;t may be look|ed
upon as the ancienter of the Two, I
que&s;tion not but the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets were
the Copiers of the <HI>Greek</HI> Statuaries.
Tho' on other Occa&s;ions we often find
the Statuaries took their Subjects from
the Poets. The <HI>Laocoon</HI> is too known
an In&s;tance among many others that are
to be met with at <HI>Rome.</HI> In the <HI>Villa
Aldabrandina</HI> are the Figures of an Old
and Young Man, engag'd together at
the <HI>Cae&s;tus,</HI> who are probably the <HI>Dares</HI>
and <HI>Entellus</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI>; where by the
way one may ob&s;erve the Make of the
ancient <HI>Cae&s;tus,</HI> that it only con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;o many large Thongs about the Hand,
without any thing like a Piece of Lead at
the End of them, as &s;ome Writers of
Antiquities have fal&s;ely imagin'd.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but many Pa&s;&s;ages in
the old Poets hint at &s;everal Parts of
Sculpture, that were in Vogue in the
Author's Time, tho' they are now ne|ver
thought of, and that therefore &s;uch
Pa&s;&s;ages lo&s;e much of their Beauty in the
Eye of a Modern Reader, who does not

<P>It is certain that Satyr delights in &s;uch

<P><PB N="241" REF="262">
<HI>Juvenal</HI> here de&s;cribes the Simplicity
of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers, and the Fi|gures
that were generally Engraven on
their Helmets. The Fir&s;t of 'em was
the Wolf giving Suck to <HI>Romulus</HI> and
<HI>Rhemus</HI>: The Second, which is com|prehended
in the Two la&s;t Ver&s;es, is not
&s;o Intelligible. Some of the Commen|tators
tell us, that the God here men|tion'd
is <HI>Mars,</HI> that he comes to &s;ee his
Two Sons &s;ucking the Wolf, and that
the old Sculptors generally drew their
Figures naked, that they might have the
Advantage of repre&s;enting the different
Swelling of the Mu&s;cles, and the Turns
of the Body. But they are extremely
at a Lo&s;s to know what is meant by the
Word <HI>Pendentis</HI>; &s;ome fancy it expre&s;&s;es
only the great Embo&s;sment of the Fi|gure,
others believe it hung off the Hel|met
in <HI>Alto Relievo,</HI> as in the foregoing
Tran&s;lation. <HI>Lubin</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that the
God <HI>Mars</HI> was Engraven on the Shield,
and that he is &s;aid to be hanging, becau&s;e
the Shield which bore him hung on the
Left Shoulder. One of the old Inter|preters
is of Opinion, that by hanging
is only meant a Po&s;ture of bending for|ward
to &s;trike the Enemy. Another will
have it, that whatever is placed on the
Head may be &s;aid to hang, as we call
<PB N="242" REF="263">
hanging Gardens, &s;uch as are planted on
the Top of the Hou&s;e. Several learned
Men, who like none of the&s;e Explica|tions,
believe there has been a Fault in
the Tran&s;criber, and that <HI>Pendentis</HI> ought
to be <HI>Perdentis</HI>; but they quote no Ma|nu&s;cript
in Favour of their Conjecture.
The true Meaning of the Words is cer|tainly
as follows. The <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers,
who were not a little proud of their
Founder, and the Military Genius of
their Republick, us'd to bear on their
Helmets the Fir&s;t Hi&s;tory of <HI>Romulus,</HI>
who was begot by the God of War, and
&s;uckled by a Wolf. The Figure of the
God was made as if de&s;cending upon the
Prie&s;te&s;s <HI>Ilia,</HI> or as others call her <HI>Rhea
Silvia.</HI> The Occa&s;ion required his Body
&s;hould be naked,
<Q><L>Tu quoque inermis eras cum te formo&s;a Sa|cerdos</L>
<L>Cepit: ut huic urbi Semina magna dares.</L><BIBL>Ov. de Fa&s;. L. 3.</BIBL><L>Then too, our mighty Sire, thou &s;tood'&s;t

tho' on other Occa&s;ions he is drawn, as
<HI>Horace</HI> has de&s;crib'd him, <HI>Tunic&acirc; cinctum
adamantin&acirc;.</HI> The Sculptor however, to
di&s;tingui&s;h him from the re&s;t of the Gods,
gave him what the Medalli&s;ts call his
proper Attributes, a Spear in one Hand,
and a Shield in the other. As he was
repre&s;ented de&s;cending, his Figure ap|pear'd
&s;u&s;pended in the Air over the Ve|&s;tal
Virgin, in which Sen&s;e the Word
<HI>Pendentis</HI> is extremely proper and Poeti|cal.
Be&s;ides the Antique <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo,</HI>
that made me fir&s;t think of this Inter|pretation,
I have &s;ince met with the &s;ame
Figures on the Rever&s;es of a couple of an|cient
Coins, which were &s;tamp'd in the
Reign of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> as a Compli|ment
to that Emperor, whom for his
Excellent Government and Conduct of

as a Second kind of Founder.

they make in Marble, there is
not One String-In&s;trument that &s;eems
comparable to our Violins, for they are
all play'd on, either by the bare Fingers,
or the <HI>Plectrum,</HI> &s;o that they were in|capable
of adding any length to their
Notes, or of varying 'em by tho&s;e in|&s;en&s;ible
Swellings, and wearings away of
Sound upon the &s;ame String, which give
&s;o wonderful a Sweetne&s;s to our Modern
Mu&s;ick. Be&s;ides, that the String-In&s;tru|ments
mu&s;t have had very low and feeble
Voices, as may be gue&s;s'd from the &s;mall
Proportion of Wood about 'em, which
could not contain Air enough to render
the Strokes, in any con&s;iderable mea|&s;ure,
full and &s;onorous. There is a great
deal of difference in the Make, not only
of the &s;everal kinds of In&s;truments, but
even among tho&s;e of the &s;ame Name.
The <HI>Syringa,</HI> for Example, has &s;ometimes
Four, and &s;ometimes more Pipes, as high
as to Twelve. The &s;ame Variety of
Strings may be ob&s;erved on their Harps,
and of Stops on their <HI>Tibiae,</HI> which &s;hows
<PB N="248" REF="269">
the little Foundation that &s;uch Writers
have gone upon, who from a Ver&s;e per|haps
in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Eclogues, or a &s;hort Pa&s;|&s;age
in a <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic</HI> Author, have been &s;o
very nice in determining the preci&s;e Shape
of the ancient Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, with
the exact Number of their Pipes, Strings
and Stops. It is indeed the u&s;ual Fault
of the Writers of Antiquities, to &s;treighten
and confine them&s;elves to particular Mo|dels.
They are for making a kind of
Stamp on every thing of the &s;ame Name,
and if they find any thing like an old De|&s;cription
of the Subject they Treat on,
they take care to regulate it on all Oc|ca&s;ions,
according to the Figure it makes
in &s;uch a &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age: As the learned
<HI>German</HI> Author, quoted by Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Baudelot,</HI> who had probably never &s;een
any thing of a Hou&s;hold-God, more than
a <HI>Canopus,</HI> affirms roundly, that all the
ancient <HI>Lares</HI> were made in the Fa&s;hion
of a Jug-Bottle. In &s;hort, the Antiqua|ries
have been guilty of the &s;ame Fault
as the Sy&s;teme-Writers, who are for
cramping their Subjects into as narrow a
Space as they can, and for reducing the
whole Extent of a Science into a few
general Maxims. This a Man has occa|&s;ion
of ob&s;erving more than once, in the
&s;everal Fragments of Antiquity that are
<PB N="249" REF="270">
&s;till to be &s;een in <HI>Rome.</HI> How many
Dre&s;&s;es are there for each particular De|ity?
What a Variety of Shapes in the
ancient Urns, Lamps, Lachrymary Ve&s;|&s;els,
<HI>Priapus's,</HI> Hou&s;hold-Gods, which
have &s;ome of 'em been repre&s;ented under
&s;uch a particular Form, as any one of 'em
has been de&s;crib'd with in an ancient
Author, and would probably be all &s;o,
were they not &s;till to be &s;een in their
own Vindication? Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> from
&s;ome old Cuts of <HI>Terence,</HI> fancies that the
<HI>Larva</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ona</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Actors,
was not only a Vizard for the Face, but
had fal&s;e Hair to it, and came over the
whole Head like a Helmet. Among all
the Statues at <HI>Rome,</HI> I remember to have
&s;een but Two that are the Figures of
Actors, which are both in the <HI>Villa Mat|thei.</HI>
One &s;ees on 'em the Fa&s;hion of
the old Sock and <HI>Larva,</HI> the latter of
which an&s;wers the De&s;cription that is
given of it by this learned Lady, tho' I
que&s;tion not but &s;everal others were in
u&s;e; for I have &s;een the Figure of <HI>Tha|lia,</HI>
the Comic Mu&s;e, &s;ometimes with
an entire Head-piece in her Hand, &s;ome|times
with about half the Head, and a
little Friz, like a Tower, running round
the Edges of the Face, and &s;ometimes
with a Mask for the Face only, like tho&s;e
<PB N="250" REF="271">
of a Modern Make. Some of the <HI>Ita|lian</HI>
Actors wear at pre&s;ent the&s;e Masks
for the whole Head. I remember for|merly
I could have no Notion of that
Fable in <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> before I had &s;een the
Figures of the&s;e entire Head-pieces.<Q><L>Per&s;onam Tragicam fort&egrave; vulpes viderat:</L>

<L>How va&s;t a Head is here without a

<P>I find Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has taken no|tice
of this Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> upon the
&s;ame Occa&s;ion; but not of the follow|ing
one in <HI>Martial,</HI> which alludes to the
&s;ame kind of Masks.<Q><L>Non omnes fallis, &s;cit te Pro&s;erpina ca|num,</L>

<P>In the <HI>Villa Borghe&s;e</HI> is the Bu&s;t of
a young <HI>Nero,</HI> which &s;hows us the Form
of an ancient <HI>Bulla</HI> on the Brea&s;t, which
is neither like a Heart, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> de|&s;cribes
it, nor altogether re&s;embles that
in Cardinal <HI>Chigi</HI>'s Cabinet; &s;o that with|out
e&s;tabli&s;hing a particular In&s;tance in|to
a general Rule, we ought, in Subjects
of this Nature, to leave room for the
Humour of the Arti&s;t or Wearer. There
are many Figures of Gladiators at <HI>Rome,</HI>
tho' I don't remember to have &s;een any
of the <HI>Retiarius,</HI> the <HI>Samnite,</HI> or the
Antagoni&s;t to the <HI>Pinnirapus.</HI> But what
I could not find among the Statues, I
met with in Two Antique Pieces of
Mo&s;aic, which are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
a Cardinal. The <HI>Retiarius</HI> is engag'd
with the <HI>Samnite,</HI> and has had &s;o lucky
a Throw, that his Net covers the whole
Body of his Adver&s;ary from Head to
Foot, yet his Antagoni&s;t recover'd him|&s;elf
out of the Toiles, and was Con|queror,
<PB N="252" REF="273">
according to the In&s;cription.
In another Piece is repre&s;ented the Com|bat
of the <HI>Pinnirapus,</HI> who is arm'd
like the <HI>Samnite,</HI> and not like the <HI>Reti|arius,</HI>
as &s;ome learned Men have &s;uppo|&s;ed:
On the Helmet of his Antagoni&s;t
are &s;een the Two <HI>Pinnae,</HI> that &s;tand up
on either Side like the Wings in the
<HI>Peta&s;us</HI> of a <HI>Mercury,</HI> but ri&s;e much
higher, and are more pointed.</P>
<P>There is no part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Anti|quities
that we are better acquainted
with, than what relates to their Sacri|fices.
For as the Old <HI>Romans</HI> were ve|ry
much devoted to their Religion, we
&s;ee &s;everal Parts of it entering their an|cient
<HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo's,</HI> Statues and Me|dals,
not to mention their Altars, Tombs,
Monuments, and tho&s;e particular Or|naments
of Architecture which were
borrow'd from it. An Heathen Ritual
could not in&s;truct a Man better than the&s;e
&s;everal Pieces of Antiquity, in the parti|cular
Ceremonies and Punctilio's that at|tended
the different kinds of Sacrifices.
Yet there is a much greater Variety in
the Make of the Sacrificing In&s;truments,
than one finds in tho&s;e who have Treat|ed
of them, or have given us their Pi|ctures.
For not to in&s;i&s;t too long on
&s;uch a Subject, I &s;aw in Signior <HI>Anto|nio

I might here enlarge on the Shape of
the Triumphal Chariot, which is diffe|rent
in &s;ome Pieces of Sculpture from
what it appears in others; and on the
Figure of the <HI>Di&s;cus,</HI> that is to be &s;een

I could never di&s;cover the &s;everal diffe|rent
<HI>Roman</HI> Garments, for 'tis very dif|ficult
to Trace out the Figure of a Ve&s;t,
thro' all the Plaits and Foldings of the
Drapery; be&s;ides, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Gar|ments
did not differ from each other,
&s;o much by the Shape as by the Em|broidery
and Colour, the one of which
was too nice for the Statuary's Ob&s;erva|tion,

After this it is worth while to read the

&s;aid that the Prince <HI>Farne&s;e,</HI> who is the
pre&s;ent Owner of this Seat, will keep
it from being turn'd up 'till he &s;ees one
of his own Family in the Chair. There
are Undertakers in <HI>Rome</HI> who often pur|cha&s;e
the digging of Fields, Gardens,
<PB N="228" REF="279">
or Vineyards, where they find any like|lihood
of &s;ucceeding, and &s;ome have
been known to arrive at great E&s;tates by
it. They pay according to the Dimen|&s;ions
of the Surface they are to break
up, and after having made E&s;&s;ays into
it, as they do for Coal in <HI>England,</HI> they
rake into the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Parts of
it, tho' they often find, to their Di&s;ap|pointment,
that others have been before|hand
with 'em. However they gene|rally
gain enough by the Rubbi&s;h and
Bricks, which the pre&s;ent Architects va|lue
much beyond tho&s;e of a Modern
Make, to defray the Charges of their
Search. I was &s;hown Two Spaces of
Ground, where part of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Golden
Hou&s;e &s;tood, for which the Owner has
been offer'd an extraordinary Sum of
Mony. What encourag'd the Undertakers
are &s;everal very ancient Trees, which
grow upon the Spot, from whence they
conclude that the&s;e particular Tracts of
Ground mu&s;t have lain untouch'd for
&s;ome Ages. 'Tis pity there is not &s;ome|thing
like a publick Regi&s;ter, to pre&s;erve
the Memory of &s;uch Statues as have been
found from time to time, and to mark
the particular Places where they have
been taken up, which would not only
prevent many fruitle&s;s Searches for the
<PB N="259" REF="280">
future, but might often give a con&s;idera|rable
Light into the Quality of the Place,
or the De&s;ign of the Statue.</P>
<P>But the great Magazine for all kinds
of Trea&s;ure is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Bed of
the <HI>Tiber.</HI> We may be &s;ure, when the
<HI>Romans</HI> lay under the Apprehen&s;ions of
&s;eeing their City &s;ack'd by a barbarous
Enemy, as they have done more than
once, that they would take care to be|&s;tow
&s;uch of their Riches this way as
could be&s;t bear the Water: be&s;ides what
the In&s;olence of a Bruti&s;h Conqueror
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have contributed, who
had an Ambition to wa&s;te and de&s;troy all
the Beauties of &s;o celebrated a City. I
need not mention the old Common-&s;hore
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which ran from all Parts of
the Town with the Current and Vio|lence
of an ordinary River, nor the fre|quent
Inundations of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> which
may have &s;wept away many of the Or|naments
of its Banks, nor the &s;everal
Statues that the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves flung
into it, when they would revenge them|&s;elves
on the Memory of an ill Citizen,
a dead Tyrant, or a Di&s;carded Favourite.
At <HI>Rome</HI> they have &s;o general an Opini|on
of the Riches of this River, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> have formerly proffer'd the Pope
to clean&s;e it, &s;o they might have, for
<PB N="260" REF="281">
their Pains, what they found in the Bo|&s;ome
of it. I have &s;een the Valley near
<HI>Ponte molle,</HI> which they propos'd to fa|&s;hion
into a new Channel for it, 'till they
had clear'd the old for its Reception.
The Pope however would not comply
with the Propo&s;al, as fearing the Heats
might advance too far before they had
fini&s;hed their Work, and produce a Pe&s;ti|lence
among his People; tho' I don't
&s;ee why &s;uch a De&s;ign might not be ex|ecuted
now with as little Danger as in
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Time, were there as many
Hands employ'd upon it. The City of
<HI>Rome</HI> would receive a great Advantage
from the Undertaking, as it would rai&s;e
the Banks and deepen the Bed of the
<HI>Tiber,</HI> and by Con&s;equence free 'em from
tho&s;e frequent Inundations to which
they are &s;o &s;ubject at pre&s;ent; for the
Channel of the River is ob&s;erved to be
narrower within the Walls, than either
below or above them.</P>
<P>Before I quit this Subject of the Sta|tues,
I think it very ob&s;ervable, that a|mong
tho&s;e which are already found there
&s;hould be &s;o many not only of the &s;ame
Per&s;ons, but made after the &s;ame De&s;ign.
One would not indeed wonder to &s;ee &s;e|veral
Figures of particular Deities and
Emperors, who had a Multitude of Tem|ples
<PB N="261" REF="282">
erected to 'em, and had their &s;eve|ral
Sets of Wor&s;hippers and Admirers.
Thus <HI>Ceres,</HI> the mo&s;t beneficent and
u&s;eful of the Heathen Divinities, has
more Statues than any other of the Gods
or Godde&s;&s;es, as &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Empere&s;&s;es took a Plea&s;ure to be re|pre&s;ented
in her Dre&s;s. And I believe
one finds as many Figures of that excel|lent
Emperor <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> as of all
the re&s;t together; becau&s;e the <HI>Romans</HI>
had &s;o great a Veneration for his Memo|ry,
that it grew into a part of their Re|ligion
to pre&s;erve a Statue of him in al|mo&s;t
every private Family. But how
comes it to pa&s;s, that &s;o many of the&s;e
Statues are cut after the very &s;ame Mo|del,
and not only of the&s;e, but of &s;uch
as had no Relation, either to the Inte|re&s;t
or Devotion of the Owner, as the
dying <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> the <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> the Faune
leaning again&s;t the Trunk of a Tree, the
Boy with the Bird in his Hand, the <HI>Leda</HI>
and her Swan, with many others of the
&s;ame Nature. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I always
look upon Figures of this kind, as the
Copies of &s;ome celebrated Ma&s;ter-piece,
and que&s;tion not but they were famous
Originals, that gave Ri&s;e to the &s;everal
Statues which we &s;ee with the &s;ame Air,
Po&s;ture, and Attitudes: What confirms
<PB N="262" REF="283">
me in this Conjecture, there are many
ancient Statues of the <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI>
the <HI>Silenus</HI> with the young <HI>Bacchus</HI> in
his Arms, the <HI>Hercules Farne&s;e,</HI> the <HI>An|tin&ouml;us,</HI>
and other beautiful Originals of
the Ancients, that are already drawn
out of the Rubbi&s;h, where they lay
conceal'd for &s;o many Ages. Among
the re&s;t I have ob&s;erved more that are
form'd after the De&s;ign of the <HI>Venus</HI> of
<HI>Medicis</HI> than of any other, from whence
I believe one may conclude, that it was the
mo&s;t celebrated Statue among the Anci|ents,
as well as among the Moderns. It has
always been u&s;ual for Sculptors to work
upon the be&s;t Models, as it is for tho&s;e that
are Curious to have Copies of them.</P>
<P>I am apt to think &s;omething of the
&s;ame Account may be given of the
Re&s;emblance that we meet with in many
of the Antique <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo's.</HI> I re|member
I was very well plea&s;ed with
the Device of one that I met with on
the Tomb of a young <HI>Roman</HI> Lady,
which had beem made for her by her
Mother. The Sculptor had cho&s;en the
Rape of <HI>Pro&s;erpine</HI> for his Device, where
in one End you might &s;ee the God of
the Dead (<HI>Pluto</HI>) hurrying away a beau|tiful
young Virgin, (<HI>Pro&s;erpine</HI>) and at
the other the Grief and Di&s;traction of
<PB N="263" REF="284">
the Mother (<HI>Ceres</HI>) on that Occa&s;ion. I
have &s;ince ob&s;erved the &s;ame Device up|on
&s;everal <HI>Sarcophagi,</HI> that have enclos'd
the A&s;hes of Men or Boys, Maids or
Matrons; for when the Thought took,
tho' at fir&s;t it received its Ri&s;e from
&s;uch a particular Occa&s;ion as I have
mention'd, the Ignorance of the Sculptors
apply'd it promi&s;cuou&s;ly. I know there
are Authors who di&s;cover a My&s;tery in
this Device.</P>
<P>A Man is &s;ometimes &s;urprized to find
&s;o many extravagant Fancies as are cut
on the old Pagan Tombs. Masks, Hun|ting-matches,
and Bacchanals are very
common; &s;ometimes one meets with a
lewd Figure of a <HI>Priapus,</HI> and in the
<HI>Villa Pamphilia</HI> is &s;een a Satyr coupling
with a Goat. There are however many
of a more &s;erious Nature, that &s;hadow
out the Exi&s;tence of the Soul after
Death, and the Hopes of a happy Im|mortality.
I cannot leave the <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relie|vo's</HI>
without mentioning one of 'em,
where the Thought is extreamly noble.
It is call'd <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Apotheo&s;is,</HI> and con|&s;i&s;ts
of a Groupe of Figures cut in the
&s;ame Block of Marble, and ri&s;ing one a|bove
another by Four or Five different
A&s;cents. <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;its at the Top of it
with a Thunderbolt in his Hand, and,
<PB N="264" REF="285">
in &s;uch a Maje&s;ty as <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf re|pre&s;ents
him, pre&s;ides over the Ceremony.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines"></L></Q></P>
<P>Immediately beneath him are the Fi|gures
of the Nine Mu&s;es, &s;uppos'd to
be celebrating the Prai&s;es of the Poet.
<HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf is placed at one End of
the lowe&s;t Row, &s;itting in a Chair of
State, which is &s;upported on each Side
by the Figure of a kneeling Woman.
The one holds a Sword in her Hand to
repre&s;ent the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or Actions of <HI>Achil|les,</HI>
as the other has an <HI>Aplu&s;tre</HI> to repre|&s;ent
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;y,</HI> or Voyage of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI>
About the Poet's Feet are creeping a
Couple of Mice, as an Emblem of the
<HI>Batracho-myomachia.</HI> Behind the Chair
&s;tands Time, and the Genius of the
Earth, di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their proper At|tributes,
and putting a Garland on the
Poet's Head, to intimate the mighty Re|putation
he has gain'd in all Ages, and
in all Nations of the World. Before
him &s;tands an Altar with a Bull ready
to be Sacrific'd to the new God, and
behind the Victim a Train of the &s;everal
Vertues that are repre&s;ented in <HI>Homer</HI>'s

Works, or to be learnt out of them,
lifting up their Hands in Admiration of

This Antique Piece of Sculpture
is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Con&s;table <HI>Co|lonna,</HI>
but never &s;hown to tho&s;e who &s;ee
the Palace, unle&s;s they particularly de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Among the great Variety of ancient
Coins which I &s;aw at <HI>Rome,</HI> I could not
but take particular notice of &s;uch as re|late
to any of the Buildings or Statues
that are &s;till Extant. Tho&s;e of the
Fir&s;t kind have been already publi&s;h|ed
by the Writers of the <HI>Roman</HI> An|tiquities,
and may be mo&s;t of them
met with in the la&s;t Edition of <HI>Donatus,</HI>
as the Pillars of <HI>Trajan</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> the
Arches of <HI>Dru&s;us Germanicus,</HI> and <HI>Sep|timius
Severus,</HI> the Temples of <HI>Janus,</HI>
<HI>Concord, Ve&s;ta, Jupiter tonans, Apollo</HI>
and <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> the <HI>Circus Maximus, Ago|nalis,</HI>
and that of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> or, accor|ding
to <HI>Fabretti,</HI> of <HI>Galienus,</HI> of <HI>Ve&s;pa|&s;ian</HI>'s
Amphitheater, and <HI>Alexander Se|verus</HI>'s
Baths; tho', I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the
Subject of the la&s;t may be very well
doubted of. As for the <HI>Meta &s;udans</HI>
and <HI>Pons Aelius,</HI> which have gain'd a
Place among the Buildings that are now
&s;tanding, and to be met with on old
Rever&s;es of Medals: The Coin that
<PB N="266" REF="287">
&s;hows the fir&s;t is generally rejected as
&s;purious: nor is the other, tho' cited in the
la&s;t Edition of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vaillant,</HI> e&s;teem'd
more Authentick by the pre&s;ent <HI>Roman</HI>
Medalli&s;ts, who are certainly the mo&s;t
skilful in the World, as to the Mecha|nical
Part of this Science. I &s;hall clo&s;e
up this Set of Medals with a very Cu|rious
one, as large as a Medalion, that
is &s;ingular in its kind. On one Side is
the Head of the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> the
Rever&s;e has on it the <HI>Circus Maximus,</HI>
and a View of the Side of the <HI>Palatine</HI>
Mountain that faces it, on which are
&s;een &s;everal Edifices, and among the re&s;t
the famous Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> that has
&s;till a con&s;iderable Ruin &s;tanding. This
Medal I &s;aw in the Hands of Mon&s;eig|neur
<HI>Strozzi,</HI> Brother to the Duke of
that Name, who has many Curio&s;ities
in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is very obliging to
a Stranger who de&s;ires the Sight of
'em. It is a &s;urpri&s;ing thing; that among
the great Pieces of Architecture repre|&s;ented
on the old Coins, one can never
meet with the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> the <HI>Mau&s;olaeum</HI>
of <HI>Augu&s;tus, Nero</HI>'s Golden Hou&s;e, the
<HI>Moles Adriani,</HI> the <HI>Septizonium</HI> of <HI>Seve|rus,</HI>
the Baths of <HI>Diocle&s;ian,</HI> &amp;c. But
&s;ince it was the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperors thus to Regi&s;ter their mo&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="288">
remarkable Buildings, as well as Actions,
and &s;ince there are &s;everal in either of
the&s;e kinds not to be found on Medals,
more extraordinary than tho&s;e that are;
we may, I think, with great Rea&s;on
&s;u&s;pect our Collections of old Coins to
be extremely deficient, and that tho&s;e
which are already found out &s;carce bear
a Proportion to what are yet undi&s;co|ver'd.
A Man takes a great deal more
Plea&s;ure in &s;urveying the ancient Statues,
who compares them with Medals, than
it is po&s;&s;ible for him to do without &s;ome
little Knowledge this way; for the&s;e
Two Arts illu&s;trate each other; and as
there are &s;everal Particulars in Hi&s;tory
and Antiquities which receive a great
Light from ancient Coins, &s;o would it
be impo&s;&s;ible to Decipher the Faces of
the many Statues that are to be &s;een at
<HI>Rome,</HI> without &s;o Univer&s;al a Key to
them. It is this that teaches to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the Kings and Con&s;uls, Emperors
and Empere&s;&s;es, the Deities and Virtues,
with a Thou&s;and other Particulars re|lating
to Statuary, and not to be learnt
by any other Means. In the <HI>Villa Pam|philia</HI>
&s;tands the Statue of a Man in
Woman's Cloaths, which the Anti|quaries
do not know what to make of,
and therefore pa&s;s it off for an <HI>Her|maphrodite</HI>;
<PB N="268" REF="289">
But a learned Medalli&s;t
in <HI>Rome</HI> has lately fix'd it to <HI>Clodius,</HI>
who is &s;o famous for having intruded into
the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">emnities of the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> in a
Woman's Habit, for one &s;ees the &s;ame
Features and Make of Face in a Medal
of the <HI>Clodian</HI> Family.</P>
<P>I have &s;een on Coins the Four fine&s;t
Figures perhaps that are now Extant:
The <HI>Hercules Farne&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Me|dicis,</HI>
the <HI>Apollo</HI> in the <HI>Belvidere,</HI> and
the famous <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> on Hor&s;e|back.
The olde&s;t Medal that the Fir&s;t
appears upon is one of <HI>Commodus,</HI> the
Second on one of <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> the Third
on one of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> and the la&s;t
on one of <HI>Lucius Verus.</HI> We may con|clude,
I think, from hence, that the&s;e
Statues were extremely celebrated a|mong
the old <HI>Romans,</HI> or they would
never have been honoured with a Place
among the Emperor's Coins. We may
further ob&s;erve, that all Four of 'em
make their fir&s;t Appearance in the <HI>An|tonine</HI>
Family, for which Rea&s;on I am apt
to think they are all of them the Pro|duct
of that Age. They would proba|bly
have been mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI> the
Naturali&s;t, who liv'd in the next Reign,
&s;ave one, before <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> had they
been made in his Time. As for the
<PB N="269" REF="290">
Brazen Figure of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> on
Hor&s;eback, there is no doubt of its be|ing
of this Age, tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s it
may be doubted, whether the Medal I
have cited repre&s;ents it. All I can &s;ay
for it is, that the Hor&s;e and Man on the
Medal are in the &s;ame Po&s;ture as they
are on the Statue, and that there is a
Re&s;emblance of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI>'s Face,
for I have &s;een this Rever&s;e on a Meda|lion
of <HI>Don Livio</HI>'s Cabinet, and much
more di&s;tinctly in another very beautiful
one, that is in the Hands of Signior <HI>Marc.
Antonio.</HI> It is generally objected, that
<HI>Lucius Verus</HI> would rather have placed
the Figure of him&s;elf on Hor&s;eback up|on
the Rever&s;e of his own Coin, than
the Figure of <HI>Marcus Aurelius.</HI> But it
is very well known that an Emperor
often &s;tamp'd on his Coins the Face or
Ornaments of his Collegue, as an In|&s;tance
of his Re&s;pect or Friend&s;hip for
him; and we may &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Lucius Verus</HI>
would omit no Opportunity of doing
Honour to <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> whom he
rather revered as his Father, than treat|ed
as his Partner in the Empire. The
Famous <HI>Antinous</HI> in the <HI>Belvidere</HI> mu&s;t
have been made too about this Age, for
he dyed towards the middle of <HI>Adrian</HI>'s
Reign, the immediate Predece&s;&s;or of
<PB N="270" REF="291">
<HI>Antoninus Pius.</HI> This entire Figure,
tho' not to be found in Medals, may be
&s;een in &s;everal precious Stones. Mon&s;i|eur
<HI>La Chau&s;&s;e,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Mu|&s;aeum
Romanum,</HI> &s;how'd me an <HI>Antinous</HI>
that he has publi&s;hed in his la&s;t Volume,
cut in a <HI>Cornelian,</HI> which he values at
Fifty Pi&s;toles. It repre&s;ents him in the
Habit of a <HI>Mercury,</HI> and is the fine&s;t <HI>In|taglia</HI>
that I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Next to the Statues, there is nothing
in <HI>Rome</HI> more &s;urpri&s;ing than that a|mazing
variety of ancient Pillars of &s;o
many kinds of Marble. As mo&s;t of the
old Statues may be well &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been cheaper to their fir&s;t Owners, than
they are to a Modern Purcha&s;er, &s;everal
of the Pillars are certainly rated at a
much lower Price at pre&s;ent than they
were of old. For not to mention what
a huge Column of <HI>Granite, Serpentine,</HI>
or <HI>Porphyry</HI> mu&s;t have co&s;t in the Quar|ry,
or in its Carriage from <HI>Egypt</HI> to
<HI>Rome,</HI> we may only con&s;ider the great
Difficulty of hewing it into any Form,
and of giving it the due Turn, Propor|tion
and Poli&s;h. It is well known how
the&s;e &s;orts of Marble re&s;i&s;t the Impre&s;|&s;ions
of &s;uch In&s;truments as are now in
u&s;e. There is indeed a <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>
who works in them, but his Advances
<PB N="271" REF="292">
are &s;o very &s;low, that he &s;carce lives up|on
what he gains by it. He &s;how'd me
a Piece of <HI>Porphyry</HI> work'd into an or|dinary
Salver, which had co&s;t him Four
Months continual Application, before
he could bring it into that Form. The
Ancients had probably &s;ome Secret to
harden the Edges of their Tools, with|out
recurring to tho&s;e Extravagant Opi|nions
of their having an Art to mollifie
the Stone, or that it was naturally &s;ofter
at its fir&s;t cutting from the Rock, or
what is &s;till more ab&s;urd, that it was an
artificial Compo&s;ition, and not the na|tural
Product of Mines and Quarries.
The mo&s;t valuable Pillars about <HI>Rome,</HI>
for the Marble of which they are made,
are the Four Columns of Oriental Ja|&s;per
in St. <HI>Paulina</HI>'s Chappel at St. <HI>Ma|ria
Maggiore</HI>; Two of Oriental Gra|nite
in St. <HI>Pudenziana</HI>; One of Tran|&s;parent
Oriental Ja&s;per in the <HI>Vatican</HI>
Library; Four of <HI>Nero-Bianco</HI> in St.
<HI>Cecilia Trans-tevere</HI>; Two of <HI>Brocatel|lo,</HI>
and Two of Oriental Agate in Don
<HI>Livio</HI>'s Palace; Two of <HI>Giallo Antico</HI> in
St. <HI>John Lateran,</HI> and Two of <HI>Verdi
Antique</HI> in the <HI>Villa Pamphilia.</HI> The&s;e are
all entire and &s;olid Pillars, and made of
&s;uch kinds of Marble as are no where
to be found but among Antiquities, whe|ther
<PB N="272" REF="293">
it be that the Veins of it are un|di&s;covered,
or that they were quite ex|hau&s;ted
upon the ancient Buildings.
Among the&s;e old Pillars I cannot forbear
reckoning a great Part of an Alabla&s;ter
Column, which was found in the Ruins
of <HI>Livia</HI>'s <HI>Portico.</HI> It is of the Colour
of Fire, and may be &s;een over the high
Altar of St. <HI>Maria</HI> in <HI>Campitello,</HI> for
they have cut it into Two Pieces, and
fix'd it in the Shape of a Cro&s;s in a Hole
of the Wall that was made on purpo&s;e
to receive it; &s;o that the Light pa&s;&s;ing
thro' it from without, makes it look,
to tho&s;e who are in the Church, like a
huge tran&s;parent Cro&s;s of Amber. As
for the Workman&s;hip of the old <HI>Roman</HI>
Pillars, Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;godetz,</HI> in his ac|curate
Mea&s;ures of the&s;e Ruins has ob|&s;erved,
that the Ancients have not kept
to the nicety of Proportion, and the
Rules of Art, &s;o much as the Moderns
in this Particular. Some, to excu&s;e this
Defect, lay the Blame of it on the Work|men
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and of other Nations,
who &s;ent mo&s;t of the ancient Pillars ready
&s;hap'd to <HI>Rome</HI>: Others &s;ay that the An|cients,
knowing Architecture was chiefly
de&s;ign'd to plea&s;e the Eye, only took
care to avoid &s;uch Di&s;proportions as
were gro&s;s enough to be ob&s;erv'd by the
<PB N="273" REF="294">
Sight, without minding whether or no
they approach'd to a Mathematical Ex|actne&s;s:
Others will have it rather to be
an Effect of Art, and of what the <HI>Italians,</HI>
call the <HI>Gu&s;to grande,</HI> than of any Negli|gence
in the Architect; for they &s;ay
the Ancients always con&s;ider'd the Situ|ation
of a Building, whether it were
high or low, in an open Square or in a
narrow Street, and more or le&s;s devia|ted
from their Rules of Art, to comply
with the &s;everal Di&s;tances and Elevations
from which their Works were to be re|garded.
It is &s;aid there is an <HI>Ionic</HI> Pillar
in the <HI>Santa Maria Tran&s;tevere,</HI> where
the Marks of the Compa&s;s are &s;till to be
&s;een on the Volute, and that <HI>Palladio</HI>
learnt from hence the working of that
difficult Problem; but I never could find
time to examine all the old Columns
of that Church. Among the Pil|lars
I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over the Two no|ble&s;t
in the World, tho&s;e of <HI>Trajan</HI> and
<HI>Antonine.</HI> There could not have been
a more magnificent De&s;ign than that of
<HI>Trajan</HI>'s Pillar. Where could an Empe|ror's
A&s;hes have been &s;o nobly lodg'd,
as in the mid&s;t of his Metropolis, and
on the Top of &s;o exalted a Monument,
with the greate&s;t of his Actions under|neath
him? Or, as &s;ome will have it,
<PB N="274" REF="295">
his Statue was on the Top, his Urn at
the Foundation, and his Battles in the
mid&s;t. The Sculpture of it is too well
known to be here mention'd. The mo&s;t
remarkable Piece in <HI>Antonine</HI>'s Pillar is the
Figure of <HI>Jupiter Pluvius,</HI> &s;ending down
Rain on the fainting Army of <HI>Marcus
Aurelius,</HI> and Thunderbolts on his Ene|mies,
which is the greate&s;t Confirma|tion
po&s;&s;ible of the Story of the Chri&s;tian
Legion, and will be a &s;tanding Evidence
for it, when any Pa&s;&s;age in an old Au|thor
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be forged. The
Figure that <HI>Jupiter</HI> here makes among
the Clouds, puts me in Mind of a Pa&s;&s;age
in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which gives ju&s;t &s;uch a|nother
Image of him. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Inter|preters
are certainly to blame, that &s;up|po&s;e
it is nothing but the Air which is
here meant by <HI>Jupiter.</HI><Q><L>Quantus ab occa&s;u veniens pluvialibus

held up its Head after all the other
Arts of De&s;igning were in a very weak

the fir&s;t among them that revived.
If I was &s;urprized not to find the Cro&s;s in
<HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Arch, I was as much di&s;|appointed
not to &s;ee the Figure of the
Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> on that of <HI>Titus,</HI>
where are repre&s;ented the Golden Can|dle&s;tick,
the Table of Shew-bread, and
the River <HI>Jordan.</HI> Some are of Opini|on,
that the compo&s;ite Pillars of this
Arch were made in Imitation of the
Pillars of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple, and ob&s;erve
that the&s;e are the mo&s;t ancient of any
that are found of that Order.</P>

It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to
form, in his Imagination, &s;uch beautiful
and glorious Scenes as are to be met
with in &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Churches

Stock of ancient Marble within

And notwith&s;tanding the incredible

they may all recover them&s;elves under

<P>The little Lake that gives Ri&s;e to this
River, with its floating I&s;lands, is one
of the mo&s;t extraordinary natural Curi|o&s;ities
about <HI>Rome.</HI> It lyes in the very
Flat of <HI>Campania,</HI> and as it is the Drain
of the&s;e Parts, 'tis no Wonder that it
is &s;o impregnated with Sulphur. It has
at Bottom &s;o thick a Sediment of it,
that upon throwing in a Stone the Wa|ter
boils for a con&s;iderable time over the
Place which has been &s;tirr'd up. At the
&s;ame time are &s;een little Flakes of Scurfe
ri&s;ing up, that are probably the Parts
which compo&s;e the I&s;lands, for they of|ten
mount of them&s;elves, tho' the Wa|ter
is not troubled.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but this Lake was for|merly
much larger than it is at pre&s;ent,
and that the Banks have grown over it
by degrees, in the &s;ame manner as the
I&s;lands have been form'd on it. Nor is
it improbable but that, in Proce&s;s of
<PB N="285" REF="306">
Time, the whole Surface of it may be
cru&s;ted over, as the I&s;lands enlarge them|&s;elves,
and the Banks clo&s;e in upon them.
All about the Lake, where the Ground
is dry, we found it to be hollow by the
Trampling of our Hor&s;es Feet. I could
not di&s;cover the lea&s;t Traces of the <HI>Si|byls</HI>
Temple and Grove, which &s;tood on
the Borders of this Lake. <HI>Tivoli</HI> is &s;een
at a di&s;tance lying along the Brow of
a Hill. Its Situation has given <HI>Horace</HI>
occa&s;ion to call it <HI>Tibur Supinum,</HI> as <HI>Vir|gil</HI>
perhaps for the &s;ame Rea&s;on entitles
it <HI>Superbum.</HI> The <HI>Villa de Medicis</HI> with
its Water-Works, the Ca&s;cade of the
<HI>Teverone,</HI> and the Ruins of the <HI>Sibyls</HI> Tem|ple
(of which <HI>Vignola</HI> has made a little
Copy at <HI>Peters de Montorio</HI>) are de&s;cri|bed
in every Itinerary. I mu&s;t confe&s;s
I was mo&s;t plea&s;ed with a beautiful Pro|&s;pect
that none of them have mentio|ned,
which lyes at about a Mile di|&s;tance
from the Town. It opens on one
Side into the <HI>Roman Campania,</HI> where
the Eye lo&s;es it &s;elf on a &s;mooth &s;paci|ous
Plain. On the other Side is a more
broken and interrupted Scene, made up
of an infinite Variety of Inequalities and
Shadowings, that naturally ari&s;e from an
agreeable Mixture of Hills, Groves and
Vallies. But the mo&s;t enlivening Part
<PB N="286" REF="307">
of all is the River <HI>Teverone,</HI> which you
&s;ee at about a Quarter of a Mile's di|&s;tance
throwing it &s;elf down a Preci|pice,
and falling by &s;everal Ca&s;cades from
one Rock to another, 'till it gains the
Bottom of the Valley, where the Sight
of it would be quite lo&s;t, did not it
&s;ometimes di&s;cover it &s;elf thro' the Breaks
and Openings of the Woods that grow
about it. The <HI>Roman</HI> Painters often
work upon this Landskip, and I am apt
to believe that <HI>Horace</HI> had his Eye upon
it in tho&s;e Two or Three beautiful Tou|ches
which he has given us of the&s;e Seats.
The <HI>Teverone</HI> was formerly call'd the
<HI>Anio.</HI><Q><L>Me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon,</L>

<L><PB N="287" REF="308">

<L>And all the beauteous Scene divides.</L></Q></P>
<P>I remember Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI> explains
<HI>Mobilibus</HI> by <HI>Ductilibus,</HI> and believes that
the Word relates to the Conduits, Pipes,
and Canals that were made to di&s;tribute
the Waters up and down, according to
the Plea&s;ure of the Owner. But any
one who &s;ees the <HI>Teverone</HI> mu&s;t be of a|nother
Opinion, and conclude it to be
one of the mo&s;t <HI>moveable</HI> Rivers in the
World, that has its Stream broken by
&s;uch a Multitude of Ca&s;cades, and is &s;o
often &s;hifted out of one Channel into a|nother.
After a very turbulent and noi|&s;ie
Cour&s;e of &s;everal Miles among the
Rocks and Mountains, the <HI>Teverone</HI> falls
into the Valley before-mentioned, where
it recovers its Temper, as it were, by
little and little, and after many Turns
and Windings glides peaceably into the
<HI>Tiber.</HI> In which Sen&s;e we are to under|&s;tand

<P>At <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> I had the Satisfaction of
&s;eeing the Fir&s;t Sketch of <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> in
the Walks and Water-Works. The
Pro&s;pect from it was doubtle&s;s much
more delightful formerly, when the <HI>Cam|pania</HI>
was &s;et thick with Towns, Villas
and Plantations. <HI>Cicero</HI>'s <HI>Tu&s;culum</HI> was
at a Place call'd <HI>Grotto Ferrate,</HI> about
Two Miles off this Town, tho' mo&s;t
of the Modern Writers have fix'd it to
<HI>Fre&s;cati. Nardini</HI> &s;ays, there was found
among the Ruins at <HI>Grotto Ferrate</HI> a
Piece of Sculpture which <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf
mentions in one of his familiar Epi&s;tles.
In going to <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> we had a fair View
of Mount <HI>Algido.</HI></P>
<P>On our Way to <HI>Palae&s;trina</HI> we &s;aw
the Lake <HI>Regillus,</HI> famous for the Ap|parition
of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> who were
here &s;een to give their Hor&s;es Drink af|ter
the Battel between the <HI>Romans</HI> and
the Son-in-Law of <HI>Tarquin.</HI> At &s;ome
di&s;tance from it we had a View of the
<HI>Lacus Gabinus,</HI> that is much larger than
<PB N="289" REF="310">
the former. We left the Road for a|bout
half a Mile to &s;ee the Sources of
a Modern Aqueduct. It is entertaining
to ob&s;erve how the &s;everal little Springs
and Rills, that break out of the Sides
of the Mountain, are glean'd up, and
conveyed thro' little covered Channels
into the main Hollow of the Aqueduct.
It was certainly very lucky for <HI>Rome,</HI>
&s;eeing it had occa&s;ion for &s;o many A|queducts,
that there chanced to be &s;uch
a Range of Mountains within its Neigh|bourhood.
For by this means they could
take up their Water from what height
they plea&s;ed, without the Expence of
&s;uch an Engine as that of <HI>Marli.</HI> Thus
the <HI>Claudian</HI> Aqueduct ran Thirty Eight
Miles, and &s;unk after the Proportion
of Five Foot and a half every Mile, by
the Advantage only of a high Source
and the low Situation of <HI>Rome. Palae|&s;trina</HI>
&s;tands very high, like mo&s;t other
Towns in <HI>Italy,</HI> for the Advantage of
the cool Breezes, for which Rea&s;on <HI>Vir|gil</HI>
calls it <HI>Altum,</HI> and <HI>Horace, Frigidum
Praene&s;te. Statius</HI> calls it <HI>Praene&s;te Sa|crum,</HI>
becau&s;e of the Famous Temple
of Fortune that &s;tood in it. There are
&s;till great Pillars of Granite, and other
Fragments of this ancient Temple. But
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Remnant of it is
<PB N="290" REF="311">
a very beautiful <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Pavement, the
fine&s;t I have ever &s;een in Marble. The
Parts are &s;o well join'd together, that
the whole Piece looks like a continued
Picture. There are in it the Figures of
a Rhinoceros, of Elephants, and of &s;e|veral
other Animals, with little Land|skips
which look very lively and well
painted, tho' they are made out of the
natural Colours and Shadows of the
Marble. I do not remember ever to
have met with any old <HI>Roman Mo&s;aic,</HI>
compo&s;ed of little Pieces of Clay half
vitrify'd, and prepared at the Gla&s;s-Hou|&s;es,
which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Smalte.</HI> The&s;e
are much in u&s;e at pre&s;ent, and may be
made of what Colour and Figure the
Work-man plea&s;es, which is a Modern
Improvement of the Art, and enables
tho&s;e who are employ'd in it to make
much finer Pieces of <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> than they
did formerly.</P>
<P>In our Excur&s;ion to <HI>Albano</HI> we went
as far as <HI>Nemi,</HI> that takes its Name from
the <HI>Nemus Dianae.</HI> The whole Coun|try
thereabouts is &s;till over-run with
Woods and Thickets. The Lake of
<HI>Nemi</HI> lyes in a very deep Bottom, &s;o
&s;urrounded on all Sides with Mountains
and Groves, that the Surface of it is ne|ver
ruffled with the lea&s;t Breath of
<PB N="291" REF="312">
Wind, which perhaps, together with
the Clearne&s;s of its Waters, gave it for|merly
the Name of <HI>Diana</HI>'s Looking-Gla&s;s.<Q><L>&mdash;Speculumque Dianae.</L><BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Prince <HI>Cae&s;arini</HI> has a Palace at <HI>Jen|&s;ano,</HI>
very near <HI>Nemi,</HI> in a plea&s;ant Situ|ation,
and &s;et off with many beautiful
Walks. In our Return from <HI>Jen&s;ano</HI>
to <HI>Albano</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>la Ricca,</HI> the
<HI>Aricia</HI> of the Ancients, <HI>Horace</HI>'s Fir&s;t
Stage from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Brundi&s;i.</HI> There
is nothing at <HI>Albano</HI> &s;o remarkable as
the Pro&s;pect from the <HI>Capucin</HI>'s Garden,
which for the Extent and Variety of
plea&s;ing Incidents is, I think, the mo&s;t
delightful one that I ever &s;aw. It takes
in the whole <HI>Campania,</HI> and terminates
in a full View of the Mediterranean.
You have a Sight at the &s;ame time of
the <HI>Alban</HI> Lake, which lyes ju&s;t by in
an Oval Figure of about Seven Miles
round, and, by rea&s;on of the continued
Circuit of high Mountains that encom|pa&s;s
it, looks like the <HI>Area</HI> of &s;ome va&s;t
Amphitheater. This, together with the
&s;everal green Hills and naked Rocks,
within the Neighbourhood, makes the
mo&s;t agreeable Confu&s;ion imaginable.

<HI>Albano</HI> keeps up its Credit &s;till for Wine,

<P>I &s;aw in the Church-yard of <HI>Bol&s;ena</HI>
an antique Funeral Monument (of that
kind which they call'd a <HI>Sarcophagus</HI>)
very entire, and what is particular, En|graven
<HI>on all Sides</HI> with a curious Re|pre&s;entation
of a Bacchanal. Had the
Inhabitants ob&s;erved a couple of lewd
Figures at one End of it, they would
not have thought it a proper Ornament
for the Place where it now &s;tands. Af|ter
having travell'd hence to <HI>Aquapen|dente,</HI>
that &s;tands in a wonderful plea&s;ant
Situation, we came to the little Brook
which &s;eparates the Pope's Dominions
from the Great Duke's. The Frontier
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Radicofani</HI> is &s;eated on the
highe&s;t Mountain in the Country, and
is as well fortify'd as the Situation of
<PB N="298" REF="319">
the Place will permit. We here found
the natural Face of the Country quite
changed from what we had been enter|tain'd
with in the Pope's Dominions.
For in&s;tead of the many beautiful Scenes
of green Mountains and fruitful Vallies,
that we had been pre&s;ented with for
&s;ome Days before, we &s;aw now nothing
but a wild naked Pro&s;pect of Rocks and
Hills, worn on all Sides with Gutters
and Channels, and not a Tree or Shrub
to be met with in a va&s;t Circuit of &s;everal
Miles. This Savage Pro&s;pect put me
in Mind of the <HI>Italian</HI> Proverb, that
<HI>The Pope has the Fle&s;h, and the Great

<HEAD>SIENNA,
LEGHORNE,
PISA.</HEAD>
<P>_SIENNA &s;tands high, and is
adorn'd with a great many
Towers of Brick, which in
the Time of the Common-wealth
were erected to
&s;uch of the Members as had done
any con&s;iderable Service to their Coun|try.
The&s;e Towers gave us a &s;ight of
the Town a great while before we en|ter'd
it. There is nothing in this City
&s;o extraordinary as the Cathedral, which
a Man may view with Plea&s;ure after he
has &s;een St. <HI>Peters,</HI> tho' 'tis quite of a|nother
Make, and can only be look'd
upon as one of the Ma&s;ter-pieces of <HI>Go|thic</HI>
Architecture. When a Man &s;ees
the prodigious Pains and Expence, that
our Fore-Fathers have been at in the&s;e
<PB N="300" REF="321">
barbarous Buildings, one cannot but fan|cy
to him&s;elf what Miracles of Archi|tecture
they would have left us, had
they only been in&s;tructed in the right
way; for when the Devotion of tho&s;e
Ages was much warmer than it is at pre|&s;ent,
and the Riches of the People
much more at the Di&s;po&s;al of the Prie&s;ts,
there was &s;o much Mony con&s;umed on
the&s;e <HI>Gothic</HI> Cathedrals, as would have
fini&s;h'd a greater Variety of Noble Buil|dings,
than have been rai&s;ed either be|fore
or &s;ince that Time.</P>
<P>One would wonder to &s;ee the va&s;t
Labour that has been laid out on this
&s;ingle Cathedral. The very Spouts are
loaden with Ornaments, the Windows
are form'd like &s;o many Scenes of Per|&s;pective,
with a Multitude of little Pil|lars
retiring one behind another, the
great Columns are finely engraven with
Fruits and Foliage that run twi&s;ting about
them from the very Top to the Bottom,
the whole Body of the Church is che|quer'd
with different Lays of White and
Black Marble, the Pavement curiou&s;ly
cut out in De&s;igns and Scripture-Stories,
and the Front cover'd with &s;uch a Va|riety
of Figures, and over-run with &s;o
many little Mazes and Labyrinths of
Sculpture, that nothing in the World
<PB N="301" REF="322">
can make a prettier Show to tho&s;e who
prefer fal&s;e Beauties, and affected Orna|ments,
to a Noble and Maje&s;tick Sim|plicity.
Over-again&s;t this Church &s;tands
a large Ho&s;pital, erected by a Shooe-Ma|ker
who has been Beatify'd, tho' ne|ver
Sainted. There &s;tands a Figure of
him &s;uper&s;crib'd, <HI>Sutor ultra Crepidam.</HI>
I &s;hall &s;peak nothing of the Extent of
this City, the Cleanline&s;s of its Streets,
nor the Beauty of its Piazza, which &s;o
many Travellers have de&s;cribed. As this
is the la&s;t Republick that fell under the
Subjection of the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> &s;o
is it &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to retain many Han|kerings
after its ancient Liberty: For
this Rea&s;on, when the Keys and Page|ants
of the Duke's Towns and Govern|ments
pa&s;s in Proce&s;&s;ion before him, on
St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t's Day, I was told that
<HI>Sienna</HI> comes in the Rear of his Do|minions,
and is pu&s;h'd forward by tho&s;e
who follow, to &s;how the Reluctancy
it has to appear in &s;uch a Solemnity. I
&s;hall &s;ay nothing of the many gro&s;s and
ab&s;urd Traditions of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Si|enna</HI>
who is the great Saint of this Place.
I think there is as much Plea&s;ure in
hearing a Man tell his Dreams, as in
reading Accounts of this Nature: A
Traveller, that thinks them worth his
<PB N="302" REF="323">
Ob&s;ervation, may fill a Book with them
at every great Town in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Sienna</HI> we went forward to
<HI>Leghorne,</HI> where the Two Ports, the
Bagnio, and <HI>Donatelli</HI>'s Statue of the
Great Duke, amid&s;t the Four Slaves
chain'd to his Pede&s;tal, are very noble
Sights. The Square is one of the lar|ge&s;t,
and will be one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful
in <HI>Italy,</HI> when this Statue is ere|cted
in it, and a Town-hou&s;e built at
one End of it to front the Church that
&s;tands at the other. They are at a con|tinual
Expence to clean&s;e the Ports, and
keep 'em from being choak'd up, which
they do by the help of &s;everal Engines
that are always at work, and employ
many of the Great Duke's Slaves. What|ever
part of the Harbour they &s;coop in,
it has an Influence on all the re&s;t, for
the Sea immediately works the whole
Bottom to a Level. They draw a dou|ble
Advantage from the Dirt that is ta|ken
up, as it clears the Port, and at the
&s;ame time dries up &s;everal Mar&s;hes a|bout
the Town, where they lay it from
time to time. One can &s;carce imagine
how great Profits the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>
receives from this &s;ingle Place, which
are not generally thought &s;o con&s;idera|ble,
becau&s;e it pa&s;&s;es for a Free Port.
<PB N="303" REF="324">
But, it is very well known how the
Great Duke, on a late occa&s;ion, not|with&s;tanding
the Privileges of the
Merchants, drew no &s;mall Sums of Mo|ny
out of them; tho' &s;till, in re&s;pect of
the exorbitant Dues that are paid at
mo&s;t other Ports, it de&s;ervedly retains
the Name of Free. It brings into his
Dominions a great Increa&s;e of People
from all other Nations. They reckon in
it near Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Jews,</HI> many of
them very Rich, and &s;o great Traffic|kers,
that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factors complain
they have mo&s;t of our Country Trade
in their Hands. 'Tis true the Strangers
pay little or no Taxes directly, but out
of every thing they buy there goes a
large Gabel to the Government. The
very Ice-Merchant at <HI>Leghorne</HI> pays a|bove
a Thou&s;and Pound Sterling annu|ally
for his Privilege, and the Tobacco-Merchant
Ten Thou&s;and. The Ground
is &s;old by the Great Duke at a very
high Price, and Hou&s;es are every Day
ri&s;ing on it. All the Commodities that
go up into the Country, of which
there are great Quantities, are clogg'd
with Impo&s;itions as &s;oon as they leave
<HI>Leghorne.</HI> All the Wines, Oils, and
Silks that come down from the fruitful
<PB N="304" REF="325">
Vallies of <HI>Pi&s;a, Florence,</HI> and other Parts
of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> mu&s;t make their Way thro'
&s;everal Duties and Taxes before they
can reach the Port. The Canal that
runs from the Sea into the <HI>Arno</HI> gives
a convenient Carriage to all Goods that
are to be &s;hipp'd off, which does not
a little enrich the Owners; and in pro|portion,
as private Men grow wealthy,
their Legacies, Law-Suits, Daughter's the
Portions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> encrea&s;e, in all which the
Great Duke comes in for a con&s;iderable
Share. The <HI>Lucque&s;e,</HI> who Traffick at this
Port, are &s;aid to bring in a great deal into
the Duke's Coffers. Another Advantage,
which may be of great u&s;e to him, is,
that at Five or Six Days warning he
might find Credit in this Town for
very large &s;umms of Money, which no
other Prince in <HI>Italy</HI> can pretend to. I
need not take notice of the Reputati|on
that this Port gives him among Fo|reign
Princes, but there is one Benefit
ari&s;ing from it, which, tho' never thrown
into the Account, is doubtle&s;s very con|&s;iderable.
It is well known how the
<HI>Pi&s;ans</HI> and <HI>Florentines</HI> long regretted the
Lo&s;s of their ancient Liberty, and their
Subjection to a Family that &s;ome of
them thought them&s;elves equal to, in
the flouri&s;hing Times of their Com|mon-wealths.
<PB N="305" REF="326">
The Town of <HI>Leghorne</HI>
has accidentally done what the greate&s;t
Fetch of Politicks would have found
difficult to have brought about, for it
has almo&s;t unpeopled <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> if we com|pare
it with what it was formerly, and
every Day le&s;&s;ens the Number of the
Inhabitants of <HI>Florence.</HI> This does not
only weaken tho&s;e Places, but at the
&s;ame time turns many of the bu&s;ie&s;t Spi|rits
from their old Notions of Honour
and Liberty, to the Thoughts of Traf|fick
and Merchandi&s;e: And as Men en|gaged
in a Road of Thriving are no
Friends to Changes and Revolutions,
they are at pre&s;ent worn into a Habit of
Subjection, and pu&s;h all their Pur&s;uits
another way. It is no Wonder there|fore
that the Great Duke has &s;uch Ap|prehen&s;ions
of the Pope's making <HI>Civi|ta
Vecchia</HI> a Free Port, which may in
time prove &s;o very prejudicial to <HI>Leg|horne.</HI>
It would be thought an impro|bable
Story, &s;hould I &s;et down the &s;e|veral
Methods that are commonly re|ported
to have been made u&s;e of, during
the la&s;t Pontificate, to put a &s;top to this
De&s;ign. The Great Duke's Mony was
&s;o well be&s;tow'd in the Conclave, that
&s;everal of the Cardinals di&s;&s;uaded the
Pope from the Undertaking, and at la&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="327">
turn'd all his Thoughts upon the little
Port which he made at <HI>Antium,</HI> near
<HI>Nettuno.</HI> The chief Work-men that were
to have convey'd the Water to <HI>Civita
Vecchia</HI> were bought off, and when a
poor <HI>Capucin,</HI> that was thought Proof
again&s;t all Bribes, had undertaken to
carry on the Work, he dy'd a little
after he had enter'd upon it. The pre|&s;ent
Pope however, who is very well
acquainted with the Secret Hi&s;tory, and
the Weakne&s;s of his Predece&s;&s;or, &s;eems
re&s;olved to bring the Project to its Per|fection.
He has already been at va&s;t
Charges in fini&s;hing the Aqueduct, and
had &s;ome Hopes that, if the War &s;hould
drive our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants from <HI>Sicily</HI>
and <HI>Naples,</HI> they would &s;ettle here. His
Holine&s;s has told &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|men,
that tho&s;e of our Nation &s;hould
have the greate&s;t Privileges of any but
the Subjects of the Church. One of
our Countreymen, who makes a good
Figure at <HI>Rome,</HI> told me the Pope has
this De&s;ign extremely at his Heart, but
that he fears the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will &s;uffer no|thing
like a Re&s;ident or Con&s;ul in his
Dominions, tho' at the &s;ame time he
hoped the Bu&s;ine&s;s might as well be tran&s;|acted
by one that had no publick Cha|racter.
This Gentleman has &s;o bu&s;ied
<PB N="107" REF="328">
him&s;elf in the Affair, that he has of|fended
the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cardinals,
in&s;omuch that Cardinal <HI>Jan&s;on</HI> refu&s;ed
to &s;ee him when he would have made
his Apology for what he had &s;aid to the
Pope on this Subject. There is one
great Objection to <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> that
the Air of the Place is not whol&s;ome;
but this they &s;ay proceeds from want of
Inhabitants, the Air of <HI>Leghorne</HI> having
been wor&s;e than this before the Town
was well peopled.</P>
<P>The great Profits which have accrued
to the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> from his Free
Port have &s;et &s;everal of the States of <HI>Italy</HI>
on the &s;ame Project. The mo&s;t likely
to &s;ucceed in it would be the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI>
who lye more convenient than the <HI>Ve|netians,</HI>
and have a more inviting Form
of Government than that of the Church,
or that of <HI>Florence.</HI> But as the Port of
<HI>Genoa</HI> is &s;o very ill guarded again&s;t
Storms, that no Privileges can tempt
the Merchants from <HI>Leghorne</HI> into it, &s;o
dare not the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> make any other of
their Ports Free, lea&s;t it &s;hould draw to
it mo&s;t of their Commerce and Inhabi|tants,
and by Con&s;equence ruin their
chief City.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leghorne</HI> I went to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> where
there is &s;till the Shell of a great City,
<PB N="808" REF="329">
tho' not half furni&s;h'd with Inhabitants.
The Great Church, Bapti&s;tery, and

<P>_IT is very plea&s;ant to &s;ee how

&s;o that one cannot find the

In all the Inhabitants there appears an

Countries which lye about 'em. There
is but one Gate for Strangers to enter
at, that it may be known what Num|bers
of them are in the Town. Over
it is written in Letters of Gold, <HI>Li|bertas.</HI></P>
<P>This Republick is &s;hut up in the
Great Duke's Dominions, who at pre|&s;ent
<PB N="110" REF="331">
is very much incen&s;ed again&s;t it, and
&s;eems to threaten it with the Fate of
<HI>Florence, Pi&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Sienna.</HI> The Oc|ca&s;ion
as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lucque&s;e</HI> plead Pre&s;cription for
Hunting in one of the Duke's Fo|re&s;ts,
that lyes upon their Frontiers,
which about Two Years &s;ince was
&s;trictly forbidden them, the Prince in|tending
to pre&s;erve the Game for his
own Plea&s;ure. Two or Three Sport&s;|men
of the Republick, who had the
Hardine&s;s to offend again&s;t the Prohi|bition,
were &s;eized, and kept in a neigh|bouring
Pri&s;on. Their Country-men,
to the number of Three&s;core, attack'd
the Place where they were kept in Cu|&s;tody,
and re&s;cued them. The Great
Duke redemands his Pri&s;oners, and, as
a further Satisfaction, would have the
Governor of the Town, where the
Three&s;core A&s;&s;ailants had combined toge|ther,
deliver'd into his Hands; but re|ceiving
only Excu&s;es, he re&s;olved to do
him&s;elf Ju&s;tice. Accordingly he order'd
all the <HI>Lucque&s;e</HI> to be &s;eiz'd that were
found on a Market-Day, in one of his
Frontier Towns. The&s;e amounted to
Four&s;core, among whom were Per&s;ons
of &s;ome Con&s;equence in the Republick.
They are now in Pri&s;on at <HI>Florence,</HI> and
<PB N="111" REF="332">
as it is &s;aid, treated hardly enough, for
there are Fifteen of the Number dead
within le&s;s than Two Years. The King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> who is Protector of the Com|mon-wealth,
received Information from
the Great Duke of what had pa&s;s'd, who
approved of his Proceedings, and order'd
the <HI>Lucque&s;e,</HI> by his Governour or <HI>Mi|lan,</HI>
to give a proper Satisfaction. The
Republick, thinking them&s;elves ill u&s;ed
by their Protector, as they &s;ay at <HI>Flo|rence,</HI>
have &s;ent to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to de|&s;ire
the Emperor's Protection, with an
offer of Winter-Quarters, as it is &s;aid,
for Four Thou&s;and <HI>Germans.</HI> The Great
Duke ri&s;es on them in his Demands,
and will not be &s;atisfy'd with le&s;s than
a Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns, and a
Solemn Amba&s;&s;y to beg Pardon for the
pa&s;t, and promi&s;e Amendment for the
future. Thus &s;tands the Affair at pre|&s;ent,
that may end in the Ruin of the
Common-wealth, if the <HI>French</HI> &s;ucceed
in <HI>Italy.</HI> It is plea&s;ant however to hear
the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Common People of
<HI>Lucca,</HI> who are firmly per&s;uaded that
One <HI>Lucque&s;e</HI> can beat Five <HI>Florentines,</HI>
who are grown low &s;pirited, as they pre|tend,
by the Great Duke's Oppre&s;&s;ions,
and have nothing worth fighting for.
They &s;ay they can bring into the Field
<PB N="312" REF="333">
Twenty or Thirty Thou&s;and fighting
Men, all ready to Sacrifice their Lives for
their Liberty. They have Quantity of
Arms and Ammunition, but few Hor&s;e.
It mu&s;t be own'd the&s;e People are more
happy, at lea&s;t in Imagination, than the
re&s;t of their Neighbours, becau&s;e they
think them&s;elves &s;o; tho' &s;uch a Chi|merical
Happine&s;s is not peculiar to Re|publicans,
for we find the Subjects of
the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> are
as proud of their Monarch as the <HI>Luc|que&s;e</HI>
of being &s;ubject to none. Should
the <HI>French</HI> Affairs pro&s;per in <HI>Italy,</HI> it is
po&s;&s;ible the Great Duke may bargain for
the Republick of <HI>Lucca,</HI> by the help of
his great Trea&s;ures, as his Predece&s;&s;ors
did formerly with the Emperor for that
of <HI>Sienna.</HI> The Great Dukes have ne|ver
yet attempted any thing on <HI>Lucca,</HI>
as not only fearing the Arms of their
Protector, but becau&s;e they are well a&s;|&s;ured,
that &s;hould the <HI>Lucque&s;e</HI> be re|duced
to the la&s;t Extremities, they would
rather throw them&s;elves under the Go|vernment
of the <HI>Geneo&s;e,</HI> or &s;ome &s;trong|er
Neighbour, than &s;ubmit to a State
for which they have &s;o great an Aver|&s;ion.
And the <HI>Florentines</HI> are very &s;en|&s;ible,
that it is much better having a
weak State within their Dominions,
<PB N="313" REF="334">
than the Branch of one as &s;trong as
them&s;elves. But &s;hould &s;o formidable a
Power, as that of the <HI>French</HI> King, &s;up|port
them in their Attempts, there is
no Government in <HI>Italy</HI> that would
dare to interpo&s;e. This Republick, for
the Extent of its Dominions, is e&s;tee|med
the riche&s;t and be&s;t peopled State
of <HI>Italy.</HI> The whole Admini&s;tration of
the Government pa&s;&s;es into different
Hands at the End of every Two Months,
which is the greate&s;t Security imagina|ble
to their Liberty, and wonderfully
contributes to the quick Di&s;patch of all
publick Affairs: But in any Exigence
of State, like that they are now pre&s;&s;ed
with, it certainly asks a much longer
time to conduct any De&s;ign, for the
Good of the Common-wealth, to its
Maturity and Perfection.</P>

either for the Per&s;on they repre&s;ent, or
the Beauty of the Sculpture. Among
the Bu&s;ts of the Emperors and Empe|re&s;&s;es
there are the&s;e that follow, which
are all very &s;carce, and &s;ome of them
almo&s;t &s;ingular in their kind. <HI>Agrippa,</HI>
<HI>Caligula, Otho, Nerva, Aelius Verus,</HI>
<HI>Pertinax, Geta, Didius, Julianus, Albi|nus</HI>
extremely well wrought, and what
is &s;eldom &s;een in Alaba&s;ter, <HI>Gordianus
Africanus</HI> the elder, <HI>Eliogabalus, Galien</HI>
the elder, and the younger <HI>Pupienus.</HI> I
have put <HI>Agrippa</HI> among the Emperors,
becau&s;e he is generally ranged &s;o in Sets
of Medals, as &s;ome that follow among
the Empere&s;&s;es have no other Right to
the Company they are joined with. <HI>Do|mitia,</HI>
<HI>Agrippina</HI> Wife of <HI>Germanicus,</HI>
<HI>Antonia, Matidia, Plotina, Mallia Scan|tilla,</HI>
fal&s;ely in&s;cribed under her Bu&s;t
<HI>Julia Severi, Aquilia Severa, Julia Mae|&s;a.</HI>
I have generally ob&s;erved at <HI>Rome,</HI>
which is the great Magazine of the&s;e
Antiquities, that the &s;ame Heads which
are rare in Medals are al&s;o rare in Mar|ble,
and indeed one may commonly a&s;|&s;ign
the &s;ame Rea&s;on for both, which
was the Shortne&s;s of the Emperor
Reigns, that did not give the Work
<PB N="317" REF="338">
men time to make many of their Fi|gures;
and as the Shortne&s;s of their
Reigns was generally occa&s;ioned by the
Advancement of a Rival, it is no Won|der
that no Body worked on the Figure
of a Decea&s;ed Emperor, when his Ene|my
was in the Throne. This Ob&s;erva|tion
however does not always hold. An
<HI>Agrippa</HI> or <HI>Caligula,</HI> for Example, is a
common Coin, but a very extraordina|ry
Bu&s;t; and a <HI>Tiberius</HI> a rare Coin, but
a common Bu&s;t, which one would the
more wonder at, if we con&s;ider the In|dignities
that were offered to this Em|peror's
Statues after his Death. The
<HI>Tiberius in Tiberim</HI> is a known In&s;tance.</P>
<P>Among the Bu&s;ts of &s;uch Emperors
as are common enough, there are &s;eve|ral
in the Gallery that de&s;erve to be ta|ken
notice of for the Excellence of the
Sculpture, as tho&s;e of <HI>Augu&s;tus, Ve&s;pa|&s;ian,</HI>
<HI>Adrian, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius
Verus, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Ge|ta.</HI>
There is in the &s;ame Gallery a beau|tiful
Bu&s;t of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, ca&s;t|ing
up his Face to Heaven, with a no|ble
Air of Grief or Di&s;contentedne&s;s in
his Looks. I have &s;een Two or Three
antique Bu&s;ts of <HI>Alexander</HI> in the &s;ame
Air and Po&s;ture, and am apt to think
the Sculptor had in his Thoughts the
<PB N="318" REF="339">
Conqueror's weeping for new Worlds,
or &s;ome other the like Circum&s;tance of
his Hi&s;tory. There is al&s;o in <HI>Porphyry</HI>
the Head of a Faun, and of the God
<HI>Pan.</HI> Among the entire Figures I took
particular notice of a Ve&s;tal Virgin,
with the Holy Fire burning before her.
This Statue, I think, may decide that
notable Controver&s;ie among the Anti|quaries,
whether the Ve&s;tals, after hav|ing
received the Ton&s;ure, ever &s;uffered
their Hair to come again, for it is here
full grown, and gathered under the Veil.
The Brazen Figure of the Con&s;ul, with
the Ring on his Finger, reminded me
of <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s <HI>majoris pondera Gemmae.</HI>
There is another Statue in Bra&s;s, &s;uppo|&s;ed
to be of <HI>Apollo,</HI> with this Modern
In&s;cription on the Pede&s;tal, which I
mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know what to
make of. <HI>Ut potui huc veni mu&s;is et fra|tre
relicto.</HI> I &s;aw in the &s;ame Gallery
the Famous Figure of the Wild Boar,
the Gladiator, the <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Cupid</HI>
and <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> the <HI>Flora,</HI> with &s;ome Mo|dern
Statues that &s;everal others have de|&s;cribed.
Among the Antique Figures
there is a fine one of <HI>Morpheus</HI> in Touch|&s;tone.
I have always ob&s;erved, that this
God is repre&s;ented by the ancient Sta|tuaries
under the Figure of a Boy a&s;leep,
<PB N="319" REF="340">
with a Bundle of Poppy in his Hand.
I at fir&s;t took it for a <HI>Cupid,</HI> 'till I had
taken notice that it had neither Bow nor
Quiver. I &s;uppo&s;e Doctor <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> has
been guilty of the &s;ame Mi&s;take in the
Reflections he makes on what he calls,
the &s;leeping <HI>Cupid</HI> with Poppy in his
Hands.<Q><L>&mdash;Qualia namque</L>
<L>Corpora nudorum tabul&acirc; pinguntur Amo|rum</L>

<L>A loaden Quiver to his Shoulders tie,</L>
<L>Or bid the <HI>Cupids</HI> lay their Quivers by.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis probable they cho&s;e to repre&s;ent
the God of Sleep under the Figure of
a Boy, contrary to all our Modern De|&s;igners,
becau&s;e it is that Age which
has its Repo&s;e the lea&s;t broken by Cares
and Anxieties. <HI>Statius,</HI> in his celebra|ted
Invocation of Sleep, addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf
to him under the &s;ame Figure.<Q><PB N="320" REF="341">

<P>I never &s;aw any Figure of Sleep that
was not of Black Marble, which has
probably &s;ome Relation to the Night,
that is the proper Sea&s;on for Re&s;t. I
&s;hould not have made this Remark, but
that I remember to have read in one of
the ancient Authors, that the <HI>Nile</HI> is
generally repre&s;ented in Stone of this
Colour, becau&s;e it flows from the Coun|try
of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI>; which &s;hows us
that the Statuaries had &s;ometimes an Eye
to the Per&s;on they were to repre&s;ent,
in the Choice they made of their Mar|ble.
There are &s;till at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ome of
<PB N="321" REF="342">
the&s;e Black Statues of the <HI>Nile</HI> which
are cut in a kind of Touch&s;tone.<Q><L>U&s;que coloratis amnis devexus ab Indis.</L><BIBL>Virg. Geor. 4. de Nilo.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>At one End of the Gallery &s;tand Two
antique Marble Pillars, curiou&s;ly wrought
with the Figures of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Arms
and In&s;truments of War. After a full
Survey of the Gallery, we were led in|to
Four or Five Chambers of Curio&s;ities
that &s;tand on the Side of it. The Fir&s;t
was a Cabinet of Antiquities, made up
chiefly of Idols, Tali&s;mans, Lamps and
Hieroglyphics. I &s;aw nothing in it that
I was not before acquainted with, except
the Four following Figures in Bra&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">I. A little Image of <HI>Juno Si&s;pita,</HI> or
<HI>So&s;pita,</HI> which perhaps is not to be met
with any where el&s;e but on Medals. She
is cloathed in a Goats-skin, the Horns
&s;ticking out above her Head. The Right
Arm is broken that probably &s;upported
a Shield, and the Left a little defac'd,
tho' one may &s;ee it held &s;omething in its
Gra&s;p formerly. The Feet are bare. I
remember <HI>Tully</HI>'s De&s;cription of this
Godde&s;s in the following Words.

<P N="2">II. An antique Model of the Famous
<HI>Laoc&ouml;on</HI> and his Two Sons, that &s;tands
in the <HI>Belvidera</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> This is the
more remarkable, as it is entire in tho&s;e
Parts where the Statue is maim'd. It was
by the help of this Model that <HI>Ban|dinelli</HI>
fini&s;hed his admirable Copy of the
<HI>Laoc&ouml;on,</HI> which &s;tands at one End of
this Gallery.</P>
<P N="3">III. An <HI>Apollo</HI> or <HI>Amphion.</HI> I took
notice of this little Figure for the Sin|gularity
of the In&s;trument, which I
never before &s;aw in ancient Sculpture.
It is not unlike a Violin, and play'd on
after the &s;ame manner. I doubt howe|ever
whether this Figure be not of a
<PB N="323" REF="344">
later Date than the re&s;t, by the Mean|ne&s;s
of the Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A <HI>Corona Radialis</HI> with only Eight
Spikes to it. Every one knows the u&s;u|al
Number was Twelve, &s;ome &s;ay Al|lu&s;ion
to the Signs of the <HI>Zodiac,</HI> and

<P>The two next Chambers are made up
of &s;everal Artificial Curio&s;ities in Ivory,
Amber, Cry&s;tal, Marble, and precious
Stones, which all Voyage-Writers are
full of. In the Chamber that is &s;hown
la&s;t &s;tands the celebrated <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Medi|cis.</HI>
The Statue &s;eems much le&s;s than
the Life, as being perfectly naked, and
in Company with others of a larger
Make: It is notwith&s;tanding as big as
the ordinary &s;ize of a Woman, as I
<PB N="324" REF="345">
concluded from the Mea&s;ure of her
Wri&s;t; for from the Bigne&s;s of any one
Part it is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s at all the re&s;t,
in a Figure of &s;uch nice Proportions.
The Softne&s;s of the Fle&s;h, the Delica|cy
of the Shape, Air and Po&s;ture, and
the Correctne&s;s of De&s;ign in this Statue
are inexpre&s;&s;ible. I have &s;everal Rea|&s;ons
to believe that the Name of the
Sculptor on the Pede&s;tal is not &s;o old
as the Statue. This Figure of <HI>Venus</HI>
put me in Mind of a Speech &s;he makes
in one of the <HI>Greek</HI> Epigrams.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines">,</L><LG>

<L>All the&s;e I frankly own without deny|ing:</L>
<L>But where has this <HI>Praxiteles</HI> been pry|ing?</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>There is another <HI>Venus</HI> in the &s;ame
Circle, that would make a good Figure
any where el&s;e. There are among the old
<HI>Roman</HI> Statues &s;everal of <HI>Venus</HI> in different
Po&s;tures and Habits, as there are many
particular Figures of her made after the
<PB N="325" REF="346">
&s;ame De&s;ign. I fancy it is not hard to
find among them &s;ome that were made
after the Three Statues of this Godde&s;s,
which <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions. In the &s;ame
Chamber is the <HI>Roman</HI> Slave whetting
his Knife and li&s;tning, which from the
Shoulders upward is incomparable. The
Two Wre&s;tlers are in the &s;ame Room.
I ob&s;erved here likewi&s;e a very curious
Bu&s;t of <HI>Annius Verus,</HI> the young Son
of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who dy'd at Nine
Years of Age. I have &s;een &s;everal other
Bu&s;ts of him at <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' his Medals
are exceeding rare.</P>
<P>The Great Duke has ordered a large
Chamber to be fitted up for old In&s;crip|tions,
Urns, Monuments, and the like
Sets of Antiquities. I was &s;hown &s;eve|ral
of them which are not yet put up.
There are the Two Famous In&s;cripti|ons
that give &s;o great a light to the Hi|&s;tories
of <HI>Appius,</HI> who made the High|way,
and of <HI>Fabius</HI> the Dictator; they
contain a &s;hort Account of the Honours
they pa&s;s'd through, and the Actions
they performed. I &s;aw too the Bu&s;ts of
<HI>Tranquillina,</HI> Mother to <HI>Gordianus Pius,</HI>
and of <HI>Quintus Herennius,</HI> Son to <HI>Trajan
Decius,</HI> which are extremely valuable
for their Rarity, and a beautiful old Fi|gure
<PB N="326" REF="347">
made after the celebrated Herma|phrodite
in the <HI>Villa Borghe&s;e.</HI> I &s;aw
nothing that has not been ob&s;erved by
&s;everal others in the <HI>Argenteria,</HI> the
Tabernacle of St. <HI>Laurence</HI>'s Chapel,
and the Chamber of Painters. The Cha|pel
of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> will be perhaps the
mo&s;t co&s;tly Piece of Work on the Face
of the Earth when compleated, but it
advances &s;o very &s;lowly, that 'tis not im|po&s;&s;ible
but the Family of <HI>Medicis</HI> may be
Extinct before their Burial Place is
fini&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The Great Duke has lived many Years
&s;eparate from the Dutche&s;s, who is at
pre&s;ent in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and in|tends
there to end her Days. The Car|dinal
his Brother is old and infirm, and
could never be induced to re&s;ign his
Purple for the uncertain Pro&s;pect of
giving an Heir to the Dukedom of <HI>Tu&s;|cany.</HI>
The Great Prince has been mar|ry'd
&s;everal Years without any Chil|dren,
and notwith&s;tanding all the Pre|cautions
in the World were taken for
the Marriage of the Prince his younger
Brother (as the finding out a Lady for
him who was in the Vigour and Flow|er
of her Age, and had given Marks of
her Fruitfulne&s;s by a former Husband)
they have all hitherto proved un&s;ucce&s;s|ful.
<PB N="327" REF="348">
There is a Branch of the Family of
<HI>Medicis</HI> in <HI>Naples</HI>: The Head of it has been
own'd as a Kin&s;man by the Grand Duke,
and 'tis thought will &s;ucceed to his Do|minions,
in ca&s;e the Princes his Sons
die Childle&s;s; though 'tis not impo&s;&s;i|ble
but in &s;uch a Conjuncture, the Com|mon-wealths,
that are thrown under
the Great Dutchy, may make &s;ome
Efforts towards the Recovery of their
ancient Liberty.</P>
<P>I was in the Library of Manu&s;cripts
belonging to St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> of which there
is a Printed Catalogue. I look'd into
the <HI>Virgil</HI> which di&s;putes its Antiquity
with that of the <HI>Vatican.</HI> It wants the
<HI>Ille ego qui quondam,</HI> &amp;c. and the Twen|ty
Two Lines in the Second <HI>Aeneid,</HI>
beginning at <HI>Jamque adeo &s;uper unus e|ram</HI>&mdash;I
mu&s;t confe&s;s I always thought
this Pa&s;&s;age left out with a great deal of
Judgment by <HI>Tucca</HI> and <HI>Varius,</HI> as it
&s;eems to contradict a Part in the Sixth
<HI>Aeneid,</HI> and repre&s;ents the Heroe in a
Pa&s;&s;ion, that is, at lea&s;t, not at all be|coming
the Greatne&s;s of his Character.
Be&s;ides, I think the Apparition of <HI>Ve|nus</HI>
comes in very properly to draw him
away from the Sight of <HI>Priam</HI>'s Mur|der;
for without &s;uch a Machine to take
him off, I can't &s;ee how the Heroe could,
<PB N="328" REF="349">
with Honour, leave <HI>Neoptolemus</HI> trium|phant,
and <HI>Priam</HI> unrevenged. But
&s;ince <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Friends thought fit to let
drop this Incident of <HI>Helen,</HI> I wonder
they would not blot out, or alter a
Line in <HI>Venus</HI>'s Speech, that has a Re|lation
to the Rencounter, and comes in
improperly without it.<Q><L>Non tibi Tyndaridae facies invi&s;a La|caenae,</L>

<P>We here quickly felt the Difference
of the Northern from the Southern
Side of the Mountains, as well in the
Coldne&s;s of the Air, as in the Badne&s;s
of the Wine. This Town is Famous
for the Richne&s;s of the Soil that lyes
about it, and the Magnificence of its
Convents. It is likewi&s;e e&s;teemed the
Third in <HI>Italy</HI> for Pictures, as having
<PB N="333" REF="354">
been the School of the <HI>Lombard</HI> Pain|ters.
I &s;aw in it Three Rarities of dif|ferent
kinds, which plea&s;ed me more
than any other Shows of the Place. The
fir&s;t was an Authentick Silver Medal of
the younger <HI>Brutus,</HI> in the Hands of an
Eminent Antiquary. One may &s;ee the
Character of the Per&s;on in the Features
of the Face, which is exqui&s;itely well
cut. On the Rever&s;e is the Cap of Li|berty,
with a Dagger on each &s;ide of it,
&s;ub&s;cribed <HI>Id. Mar.</HI> for the Ides of <HI>March,</HI>
the famous Date of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Murder.
The Second was a Picture of <HI>Raphel</HI>'s

well pre&s;erved, and repre&s;ents St. <HI>Ce|cilia</HI>

Figures of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI>; and
on the other, of <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> and
St. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI> There is &s;omething won|derfully
Divine in the Airs of this Pi|cture.
I cannot forbear mentioning, for
my Third Curio&s;ity, a new Stair-Ca&s;e
that Strangers are generally carryed to &s;ee,
where the Ea&s;ine&s;s of the A&s;cent with|in
&s;o &s;mall a Compa&s;s, the Di&s;po&s;ition
of the Lights, and the convenient Land|ing
are admirably well contrived. The
Wars of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Sea&s;on of the
Year, made me pa&s;s thro' the Dutchies
<PB N="334" REF="355">
of <HI>Modena, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> with
more ha&s;te than I would have done at
another time. The Soil of <HI>Modena</HI> and
<HI>Parma</HI> is very rich and well cultivated.
The Palaces of the Princes are magni|ficent,
but neither of them is yet fini|&s;hed.
We procured a Licence of the
Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> to enter the Theater
and Gallery, which de&s;erve to be &s;een
as well as any thing of that Nature in
<HI>Italy.</HI> The Theater is, I think, the
mo&s;t &s;pacious of any I ever &s;aw, and at
the &s;ame time &s;o admirably well contri|ved,
that from the very depth of the
Stage the lowe&s;t Sound may be heard
di&s;tinctly to the farthe&s;t part of the Au|dience,
as in a Whi&s;pering Place; and
yet if you rai&s;e your Voice as high as
you plea&s;e, there is nothing like an E|cho
to cau&s;e in it the lea&s;t Confu&s;ion.
The Gallery is hung with a numerous
Collection of Pictures, all done by ce|lebrated
Hands. On one Side of the
Gallery is a large Room adorned with
Inlaid Tables, Cabinets, Works in Am|ber,
and other Pieces of great Art and
Value. Out of this we were led into
another great Room, furni&s;hed with
old In&s;criptions, Idols, Bu&s;ts, Medals,
and the like Antiquities. I could have
&s;pent a Day with great Satisfaction in
<PB N="335" REF="356">
this Apartment, but had only time to
pa&s;s my Eye over the Medals, which
are in great Number, and many of them
very rare. The &s;carce&s;t of all is a <HI>Pe|&s;cennius
Niger</HI> on a Medalion well pre|&s;erved.
It was coined at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where
this Emperor trifled away his Time 'till
he lo&s;t his Life and Empire. The Re|ver&s;e
is a <HI>Dea Salus.</HI> There are Two
of <HI>Otho,</HI> the Rever&s;e a <HI>Serapis</HI>; and
Two of <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> and <HI>Poppaea</HI> in mid|dle
Bra&s;s, the Rever&s;es of the Emperor
<HI>Claudius.</HI> I &s;aw Two Medalions of <HI>Plo|tina</HI>
and <HI>Matidia,</HI> the Rever&s;e to each
a <HI>Pietas</HI>; with Two Medals of <HI>Perti|nax,</HI>
the Rever&s;e of one <HI>Vota Decenna|lia,</HI>
and of the other <HI>Diis Cu&s;todibus</HI>;
and another of <HI>Gordianus Africanus,</HI> the
Rever&s;e I have forgot.</P>
<P>The Principalities of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Par|ma</HI>
are much about the &s;ame Extent,
and have each of them Two large
Towns, be&s;ides a great Number of lit|tle
Villages. The Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> how|ever
is much richer than the Duke of
<HI>Modena.</HI> Their Subjects would live in
great Plenty amid&s;t &s;o rich and well cul|tivated
a Soil, were not the Taxes and
Impo&s;itions &s;o very Exorbitant; for the
Courts are much too &s;plendid and mag|nificent
for the Territories that lye a|bout
<PB N="336" REF="357">
them, and one cannot but be ama|zed
to &s;ee &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Wealth
laid out in Coaches, Trappings, Tables,
Cabinets, and the like precious Toys,
in which there are few Princes of <HI>Europe</HI>
who equal them, when at the &s;ame time
they have not had the Genero&s;ity to
make Bridges over the Rivers of their
Countries for the Convenience of their
Subjects, as well as Strangers, who are
forced to pay an unrea&s;onable Exaction
at every Ferry upon the lea&s;t Ri&s;ing of
the Waters. A Man might well expect
in the&s;e &s;mall Governments a much great|er
Regulation of Affairs, for the Ea&s;e
and Benefit of the People, than in large
over-grown States, where the Rules of
Ju&s;tice, Beneficence, and Mercy may be
ea&s;ily put out of their Cour&s;e, in pa&s;&s;ing
thro' the Hands of Deputies, and a long
Subordination of Officers. And it would
certainly be for the Good of Mankind
to have all the mighty Empires and
Monarchies of the World cantoned out
into petty States and Principalities, that,
like &s;o many large Families, might lye
under the Eye and Ob&s;ervation of their
proper Governors; &s;o that the Care of
the Prince might extend it &s;elf to every
individual Per&s;on under his Protection.
But &s;ince &s;uch a general Scheme can
<PB N="337" REF="358">
never be brought about, and if it were,
it would quickly be de&s;troyed by the
Ambition of &s;ome particular State a&s;|piring
above the re&s;t, it happens very
ill at pre&s;ent to be born under one of
the&s;e petty Soveraigns, that will be &s;till
endeavouring, at his Subjects Co&s;t, to
equal the Pomp and Grandeur of great|er
Princes, as well as to out-vie tho&s;e
of his own Rank.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on there are no People
in the World who live with more Ea&s;e
and Pro&s;perity than the Subjects of lit|tle
Common-wealths, as on the contrary
there are none who &s;uffer more under
the Grievances of a hard Government,
than the Subjects of little Principalities.
I left the Road of <HI>Milan</HI> on my Right
Hand, having before &s;een that City, and
after having pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> the
Frontier Town of <HI>Savoy,</HI> I at la&s;t came
within Sight of the <HI>Po,</HI> which is a fine
River even at <HI>Turin,</HI> though within Six
Miles of its Source. This River has
been made the Scene of Two or Three
Poetical Stories. <HI>Ovid</HI> has cho&s;en it
out to throw his <HI>Phaeton</HI> into it, after
all the &s;maller Rivers had been dryed up
in the Conflagration.</P>
<P>I have read &s;ome Botanical Criticks,
who tell us the Poets have not rightly
<PB N="338" REF="359">
followed the Traditions of Antiquity
in Metamorpho&s;ing the Si&s;ters of <HI>Phae|ton</HI>
into Poplars, who ought to have
been turned into Larch-trees; for that
it is this kind of Tree which &s;heds a
Gum, and is commonly found on the
Banks of the <HI>Po.</HI> The Change of <HI>Cyc|nus</HI>
into a Swan, which clo&s;es up the
Di&s;a&s;ters of <HI>Phaeton</HI>'s Family, was
wrought on the &s;ame Place where the
Si&s;ters were turned into Trees. The

<P>The River <HI>Po</HI> gives a Name to the
chief Street of <HI>Turin,</HI> which fronts the
Duke's Palace, and, when fini&s;h'd, will
be one of the noble&s;t in <HI>Italy</HI> for its
Length. There is one Convenience in
this City that I never ob&s;erved in any
<PB N="341" REF="362">
other, and which makes &s;ome amends
for the Badne&s;s of the Pavement. By
the help of a River, that runs on the
upper Side of the Town, they can con|vey
a little Stream of Water through
all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Streets, which
&s;erves to clean&s;e the Gutters, and carries
away all the Filth that is &s;wept into it.
The Manager opens his Sluce every
Night, and di&s;tributes the Water into
what Quarters of the Town he plea&s;es.
Be&s;ides the ordinary Convenience that
ari&s;es from it, it is of great u&s;e when a
Fire chances to break out, for at a few
Minutes warning they have a little Ri|ver
running by the very Walls of the
Hou&s;e that is Burning. The Court of
<HI>Turin</HI> is reckoned the mo&s;t &s;plendid and
Polite of any in <HI>Italy</HI>; but by rea&s;on
of its being in Mourning, I could not
&s;ee it in its Magnificence. The com|mon
People of this State are more ex|a&s;perated
again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> than even
the re&s;t of the <HI>Italians.</HI> For the great
Mi&s;chiefs they have &s;uffered from them
are &s;till fre&s;h upon their Memories, and
notwith&s;tanding this Interval of Peace,
one may ea&s;ily trace out the &s;everal Mar|ches
which the <HI>French</HI> Armies have made
through their Country, by the Ruin
and De&s;olation they have left behind
<PB N="342" REF="363">
them. I pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI>
at a time when the Duke was forced,
by the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Affairs, to be in
Alliance with the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I came directly from <HI>Turin</HI> to <HI>Gene|va,</HI>
and had a very ea&s;ie Journey over
Mount <HI>Cennis,</HI> though about the Begin|ning
of <HI>December,</HI> the Snows having not
yet fallen. On the Top of this high
Mountain is a large Plain, and in the
mid&s;t of the Plain a beautiful Lake, which
would be very extraordinary were there
not &s;everal Mountains in the Neighbour|hood
ri&s;ing over it. The Inhabitants there|about
pretend that it is unfathomable,
and I que&s;tion not but the Waters of it
fill up a deep Valley, before they come
to a Level with the Surface of the Plain.
It is well &s;tocked with Trouts, though
they &s;ay it is covered with Ice Three
Quarters of the Year.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the natural Face
of <HI>Italy</HI> that is more delightful to a Tra|veller,
than the &s;everal Lakes which are
di&s;per&s;ed up and down among the ma|ny
Breaks and Hollows of the <HI>Alps</HI> and
<HI>Appennines.</HI> For as the&s;e va&s;t Heaps of
Mountains are thrown together with &s;o
much Irregularity and Confu&s;ion, they
form a great Variety of hollow Bot|toms,
that often lye in the Figure of
<PB N="343" REF="364">
&s;o many artificial Ba&s;ins; where, if any
Fountains chance to ri&s;e, they naturally
&s;pread them&s;elves into Lakes before they
can find any I&s;&s;ue for their Waters.
The ancient <HI>Romans</HI> took a great deal
of Pains to hew out a Pa&s;&s;age for the&s;e
Lakes to di&s;charge them&s;elves into &s;ome
neighbouring River, for the bettering
of the Air, or the recovering of the
Soil that lay underneath them. The
Draining of the <HI>Fucinus</HI> by the Empe|ror
<HI>Claudius,</HI> with the prodigious Mul|titude
of Spectators who attended it,
and the Famous <HI>Naumachia</HI> and &s;plendid
Entertainment which were made upon
it before the Sluces were opened, is a
known Piece of Hi&s;tory. In all our
Journey through the <HI>Alps,</HI> as well when
we climbed as when we de&s;cended them,
we had &s;till a River running along with
the Road, that probably at fir&s;t occa&s;i|oned
the Di&s;covery of this Pa&s;&s;age. I
&s;hall end this Chapter with a De&s;cripti|on
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> as I did the la&s;t with
tho&s;e of the <HI>Appennines.</HI> The Poet per|haps
would not have taken notice, that
there is no Spring nor Summer on the&s;e
Mountains, but becau&s;e in this Re&s;pect
the <HI>Alps</HI> are quite different from the
<HI>Appennines,</HI> which have as delightful
Green Spots among them as any in <HI>Italy.</HI><Q><PB N="344" REF="365">

<HEAD>GENEVA
AND THE
LAKE.</HEAD>
<P>_NEAR St. <HI>Julian</HI> in <HI>Savoy</HI> the
<HI>Alps</HI> begin to enlarge them|&s;elves
on all &s;ides, and open
into a va&s;t Circuit of Ground,
which in Re&s;pect of the o|ther
Parts of the <HI>Alps</HI> may pa&s;s for a plain
Champian Country. This Extent of
Lands, with the <HI>Leman</HI> Lake, would make
one of the prettie&s;t and mo&s;t defen&s;ible
Dominions in <HI>Europe</HI> was it all thrown
into a &s;ingle State, and had <HI>Geneva</HI> for
its Metropolis. But there are Three
powerful Neighbours who divide among
them the greate&s;t part of this fruitful
Country. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has the
<HI>Chablais,</HI> and all the Fields that lye be|yond
the <HI>Arve,</HI> as far as to the <HI>Eclu&s;e.</HI>
The King of <HI>France</HI> is Ma&s;ter of the
whole Country of <HI>Gex</HI>; and the Canton of
<PB N="347" REF="368">
<HI>Bern</HI> comes in for that of <HI>Vaud. Gene|va</HI>
and its little Territories lye in the
Heart of the&s;e Three States. The great|e&s;t
part of the Town &s;tands upon a Hill,
and has its Views bounded on all Sides by
&s;everal Ranges of Mountains, which are
however at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, that
they leave open a wonderful Variety of
beautiful Pro&s;pects. The Situation of
the&s;e Mountains has &s;ome particular Ef|fects
on the Country, which they en|clo&s;e.
As fir&s;t, they cover it from all
Winds, except the South and North.
'Tis to the la&s;t of the&s;e Winds that the
Inhabitants of <HI>Geneva</HI> a&s;cribe the Health|fulne&s;s
of their Air; for as the <HI>Alps</HI> &s;ur|round
them on all &s;ides, they form a va&s;t
kind of Ba&s;on, where there would be a
con&s;tant Stagnation of Vapours, the
Country being &s;o well water'd, did not
the North Wind put them in Motion,
and &s;catter them from time to time.
Another Effect the <HI>Alps</HI> have on <HI>Ge|neva</HI>
is, that the Sun here ri&s;es later,
and &s;ets &s;ooner than it does to other
Places of the &s;ame Latitude. I have
often ob&s;erved that the Tops of the
neighbouring Mountains have been co|vered
with Light above half an Hour
after the Sun is down, in re&s;pect of
tho&s;e who live at <HI>Geneva.</HI> The&s;e Moun|tains
<PB N="348" REF="369">
likewi&s;e very much increa&s;e their
Summer Heats, and make up a Hori|zon
that has &s;omething in it very &s;in|gular
and agreeable. On one Side you
have the long Tract of Hills, that goes
under the Name of Mount <HI>Jura,</HI> co|vered
with Vineyards and Pa&s;turage, and
on the other huge Precipices of naked
Rocks ri&s;ing up in a Thou&s;and odd Fi|gures,
and cleft in &s;ome Places, &s;o as to
di&s;cover high Mountains of Snow that
lye &s;everal Leagues behind them. Towards
the South the Hills ri&s;e more in&s;en&s;ibly,
and leave the Eye a va&s;t uninterrupted
Pro&s;pect for many Miles. But the mo&s;t
beautiful View of all is the Lake, and
the Borders of it that lye North of the
Town.</P>
<P>This Lake re&s;embles a Sea in the Co|lour
of its Waters, the Storms that are
rai&s;ed on it, and the Ravage it makes on
its Banks. It receives too a different
Name from the Coa&s;ts it wa&s;hes, and in
Summer has &s;omething like an Ebb and
Flow, which ari&s;es from the melting of
the Snows that fall into it more copiou&s;|ly
at Noon, than at other times of the
Day. It has Five different States bor|dering
on it, the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI>
the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Canton of
<HI>Bern,</HI> the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Sion,</HI> and the
<PB N="349" REF="370">
Republick of <HI>Geneva.</HI> I have &s;een Pa|pers
fix'd up in the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> with
this magnificent Preface; <HI>Whereas we
have been informed of &s;everal Abu&s;es com|mitted
in our Ports and Harbours on the
Lake,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I made a little Voyage round the Lake,
and touch'd on the &s;everal Towns that
lye on its Coa&s;ts, which took up near
Five Days, tho' the Wind was pretty
fair for us all the while.</P>
<P>The Right Side of the Lake from
<HI>Geneva</HI> belongs to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and
is extreamly well cultivated. The great|e&s;t
Entertainment we found in coa&s;ting
it were the &s;everal Pro&s;pects of Woods,
Vineyards, Meadows, and Corn-Fields
which lye on the Borders of it, and run
up all the Sides of the <HI>Alps,</HI> where the
Barrenne&s;s of the Rocks, or the Steep|ne&s;s
of the A&s;cent will &s;uffer them.
The Wine however on this &s;ide of the
Lake is by no means &s;o good as that
on the other, as it has not &s;o open a Soil,
and is le&s;s expos'd to the Sun. We here
pa&s;s'd by <HI>Yvoire,</HI> where the Duke keeps his
Gallies, and lodg'd at <HI>Tonon,</HI> which is the
greate&s;t Town on the Lake belonging to
the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> It has Four Convents,
and they &s;ay about &s;ix or &s;even Thou|&s;and
Inhabitants. The Lake is here about
Twelve Miles in Breadth. At a little
<PB N="350" REF="371">
Di&s;tance from <HI>Tonon</HI> &s;tands <HI>Ripaille,</HI> where
is a Convent of <HI>Carthu&s;ians.</HI> They have
a large Fore&s;t cut out into Walks, that are
extremely thick and gloomy, and very
&s;uitable to the Genius of the Inhabitants.
There are <HI>Vi&s;ta</HI>'s in it of a great Length,
that terminate upon the Lake. At one
Side of the Walks you have a near Pro|&s;pect
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> which are broken in|to
&s;o many Steps and Precipices, that they
fill the Mind with an agreeable kind of
Horror, and form one of the mo&s;t ir|regular
mi&s;-&s;hapen Scenes in the World.
The Hou&s;e that is now in the Hands of
the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> belong'd formerly to the
Hermites of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> and is famous
in Hi&s;tory for the Retreat of an
Anti-Pope, who call'd him&s;elf <HI>Felix</HI> the
Fifth. He had been Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI>
and after a very glorious Reign took on
him the Habit of a Hermite, and retired
into this Solitary Spot of his Domini|ons.
His Enemies will have it, that he
lived here in great Ea&s;e and Luxury,
from whence the <HI>Italians</HI> to this Day
make u&s;e of the Proverb, <HI>Andare a Ri|paglia</HI>;

<PB N="351" REF="372">
However it was, he had not
been here half a Year before he was cho|&s;en
Pope by the Council of <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> who
took upon them to Depo&s;e <HI>Eugenio</HI> the
Fourth. This promi&s;ed fair at fir&s;t, but
by the Death of the Emperor, who fa|voured
<HI>Amadeo,</HI> and the Re&s;olution of
<HI>Eugenio,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the Church
threw it &s;elf again under the Govern|ment
of their depo&s;ed Head. Our An|ti-Pope
however was &s;till &s;upported by
the Council of <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> and owned by <HI>Sa|voy,</HI>
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> and a few other little
States. This Schi&s;m la&s;ted in the Church
Nine Years, after which <HI>Felix</HI> voluntarily
re&s;igned his Title into the Hands of Pope
<HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth, but on the following
Conditions, That <HI>Amadeo</HI> &s;hould be the
Fir&s;t Cardinal in the Conclave; That
the Pope &s;hould always receive him
&s;tanding, and offer him his Mouth to
ki&s;s; That he &s;hould be perpetual Car|dinal-Legate

That all the Cardinals of his Crea|tion
&s;hould be recognized by the Pope.
After he had made a Peace &s;o acceptable
to the Church, and &s;o honourable to
him&s;elf, he &s;pent the Remainder of his
Life with great Devotion at <HI>Ripaille,</HI>
<PB N="352" REF="373">
and dy'd with an extraordinary Repu|tation
of Sanctity.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tonon</HI> they &s;howed us a Fountain
of Water that is in great E&s;teem for its
Whole&s;omne&s;s. They &s;ay it weights
Two Ounces in a Pound le&s;s than the
&s;ame Mea&s;ure of the Lake Water, not|with&s;tanding
this la&s;t is very good to
Drink, and as clear as can be imagined.
A little above <HI>Tonon</HI> is a Ca&s;tle and &s;mall
Garri&s;on. The next Day we &s;aw other
&s;mall Towns on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI>
where there is nothing but Mi&s;ery
and Poverty. The nearer you come to
the End of the Lake the Mountains on
each &s;ide grow thicker and higher, 'till
at la&s;t they almo&s;t meet. One often &s;ees
on the Tops of the Mountains &s;everal
&s;harp Rocks that &s;tand above the re&s;t;
for as the&s;e Mountains have been doubt|le&s;s
much higher than they are at pre|&s;ent,
the Rains have wa&s;hed away a|bundance
of the Soil, that has left the
Veins of Stone &s;hooting out of them;
as in a decay'd Body the Fle&s;h is &s;till
&s;hrinking from the Bones. The Natu|ral
Hi&s;tories of <HI>Switzerland</HI> talk very
much of the Fall of the&s;e Rocks, and
the great Damage they have &s;ometimes
done, when their Foundations have been
mouldered with Age, or rent by an
Earthquake. We &s;aw in &s;everal Parts
<PB N="353" REF="374">
of the <HI>Alps</HI> that bordered upon us va&s;t
Pits of Snow, as &s;everal Mountains that
lye at a greater Di&s;tance are wholly co|vered
with it. I fancy'd the Confu&s;ion
of Mountains and Hollows, I here ob|&s;erved,
furni&s;hed me with a more proba|ble
Rea&s;on than any I have met with for
tho&s;e Periodical Fountains in <HI>Switzer|land,</HI>
which flow only at &s;uch particular
Hours of the Day. For as the Tops of
the&s;e Mountains ca&s;t their Shadows upon
one another, they hinder the Sun's &s;hining
on &s;everal Parts at &s;uch certain times, &s;o
that there are &s;everal Heaps of Snow which
have the Sun lying upon them Two or
Three Hours together, and are in the
Shade all the Day afterwards. If there|fore
it happens that any particular Foun|tain
takes its Ri&s;e from any of the&s;e Re|&s;ervoirs
of Snow, it will naturally begin
to flow on &s;uch Hours of the Day as
the Snow begins to melt: but as &s;oon as
the Sun leaves it again to freeze and
harden, the Fountain dries up, and re|ceives
no more Supplies 'till about the
&s;ame time the next Day, when the Heat
of the Sun again &s;ets the Snows a run|ning
that fall into the &s;ame little Con|duits,
Traces, and Canals, and by Con|&s;equence
break out and di&s;cover them|&s;elves
always in the &s;ame Place. At the
<PB N="354" REF="375">
very Extremity of the Lake the <HI>Rhone</HI>
enters, and, when I &s;aw it, brought a|long
with it a prodigious Quantity of
Water; the Rivers and Lakes of this
Country being much higher in Summer
than in Winter, by rea&s;on of the melt|ing
of the Snows. One would wonder
how &s;o many Learned Men could fall
into &s;o great an Ab&s;urdity, as to believe
this River could pre&s;erve it &s;elf unmix'd
with the Lake 'till its going out again
at <HI>Geneva,</HI> which is a Cour&s;e of many
Miles. It was extreamly muddy at its
Entrance when I &s;aw it, though as clear
as Rock-Water at its going out. Be|&s;ides,
that it brought in much more Wa|ter
than it carryed off. The River in|deed
pre&s;erves it &s;elf for about a Quar|ter
of a Mile in the Lake, but is af|terwards
&s;o wholly mixed, and lo&s;t with
the Waters of the Lake, that one di&s;|covers
nothing like a Stream 'till within
about a Quarter of a Mile of <HI>Geneva.</HI>
From the End of the Lake to the Source
of the <HI>Rhone</HI> is a Valley of about Four
Days Journey in Length, which gives
the Name of <HI>Valle&s;ins</HI> to its Inhabitants,
and is the Dominion of the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Sion.</HI> We lodged the Second Night at
<HI>Ville Neuve,</HI> a little Town in the Can|ton
of <HI>Bern,</HI> where we found good Ac|commodations,
<PB N="355" REF="376">
and a much greater Ap|pearance
of Plenty than on the other
&s;ide of the Lake. The next Day, hav|ing
pa&s;&s;ed by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Chillon,</HI> we
came to <HI>Ver&s;oy,</HI> another Town in the
Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> where <HI>Ludlow</HI> retired
after having left <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Lau&s;anne.</HI>
The Magi&s;trates of the Town warned
him out of the Fir&s;t by the Sollicitation
of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> as the Death
of his Friend <HI>Li&s;le</HI> made him quit the o|ther.
He probably cho&s;e this Retreat
as a Place of the greate&s;t Safety, it be|ing
an ea&s;ie matter to know what Stran|gers
are in the Town, by Rea&s;on of its
Situation. The Hou&s;e he lived in has
this In&s;cription over the Door:
<Q>Omne &s;olum forti patria

The Inhabitants of the
Place could give no Account of this
<HI>Broughton,</HI> but, I &s;uppo&s;e, by his Epi|taph,
it is the &s;ame Per&s;on that was
Clerk to the pretended High Court of
Ju&s;tice, which pa&s;&s;ed Sentence on the
Royal Martyr.</P>
<P>The next Day we &s;pent at <HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI>
the greate&s;t Town on the Lake, after
<HI>Geneva.</HI> We &s;aw the Wall of the Ca|thedral
Church that was opened by an
Earthquake, and &s;hut again &s;ome Years
after by a Second. The Crack can but
be ju&s;t di&s;cerned at pre&s;ent, though there
are &s;everal in the Town &s;till living who
have formerly pa&s;&s;ed through it. The
Duke of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who was killed in
<HI>Savoy,</HI> lyes in this Church, but without
any Monument or In&s;cription over him.
<HI>Lau&s;anne</HI> was once a Republick, but is
now under the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> and go|verned,
<PB N="358" REF="379">
like the re&s;t of their Dominions,
by a Baily who is &s;ent them every Three
Years from the Senate of <HI>Bern.</HI> There
is one Street of this Town that has the
Privilege of acquitting or condemning
any Per&s;on of their own Body, in Mat|ters
of Life and Death. Every Inha|bitant
of it has his Vote, which makes
a Hou&s;e here &s;ell better than in any o|ther
Part of the Town. They tell you
that not many Years ago it happened,
that a Cobler had the Ca&s;ting Vote for
the Life of a Criminal, which he very
graciou&s;ly gave on the merciful Side.
From <HI>Lau&s;anne</HI> to <HI>Geneva</HI> we coa&s;ted a|long
the Country of the <HI>Vaud,</HI> which
is the fruitfulle&s;t and be&s;t cultivated Part
of any among the <HI>Alps.</HI> It belonged for|merly
to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but was
won from him by the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI>
and made over to it by the Treaty of St.
<HI>Julian,</HI> which is &s;till very much regret|ted
by the <HI>Savoyard.</HI> We called in at
<HI>Morge,</HI> where there is an artificial Port,
and a &s;how of more Trade than in any
other Town on the Lake. From <HI>Morge</HI>
we came to <HI>Nyon.</HI> The <HI>Colonia E|que&s;tris,</HI>
that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;ettled in this
Country, is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been planted in this Place. They have
often dug up old <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;criptions
<PB N="359" REF="380">
and Statues, and as I walked in the Town
I ob&s;erved in the Walls of &s;everal Hou&s;es
the Fragments of va&s;t <HI>Corinthian</HI> Pillars,
with &s;everal other Pieces of Architecture,
which mu&s;t have formerly belonged to
&s;ome very Noble Pile of Building. There
is no Author that mentions this Colo|ny,
yet it is certain by &s;everal old <HI>Roman</HI>
In&s;criptions that there was &s;uch an one.
<HI>Lucan</HI> indeed &s;peaks of a Part of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>'s
Army, that came to him from the
<HI>Leman</HI> Lake in the beginning of the
Civil War.<Q>De&s;eruere cavo tentoria fixa Lemanno.</Q></P>
<P>At about Five Miles di&s;tance from
<HI>Nyon</HI> they &s;how &s;till the Ruins of <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>'s
Wall, that reached eighteen Miles
in Length from Mount <HI>Jura</HI> to the
Borders of the Lake, as he has de&s;cri|bed
it in the Fir&s;t Book of his Com|mentaries.
The next Town upon the
Lake is <HI>Ver&s;oy,</HI> which we could not
have an opportunity of &s;eeing, as belong|ing
to the King of <HI>France.</HI> It has the
Reputation of being extremely poor and
beggarly. We &s;ailed from hence di|rectly
for <HI>Geneva,</HI> which makes a very
noble Show from the Lake. There are
near <HI>Geneva</HI> &s;everal Quarries of Free|&s;tone
<PB N="360" REF="381">
that run under the Lake. When
the Water is at lowe&s;t they make with|in
the Borders of it a little Square en|clo&s;ed
with Four Walls. In this Square
they &s;ink a Pit, and dig for Free&s;tone;
the Walls hindering the Waters from
coming in upon them, when the Lake
ri&s;es and runs on all Sides of them. The
great Convenience of Carriage makes
the&s;e Stones much cheaper than any
that can be found upon firm Land.
One &s;ees &s;everal deep Pits that have been
made at &s;everal times as one &s;ails over
them. As the Lake approaches <HI>Geneva</HI>
it grows &s;till narrower and narrower,
'till at la&s;t it changes its Name into the
<HI>Rhone,</HI> that turns all the Mills of the
Town, and is extremely rapid, notwith|&s;tanding
its Waters are very deep. As
I have &s;een a great Part of the Cour&s;e
of this River, I cannot but think it has
been guided by the particular Hand of
Providence. It ri&s;es in the very Heart
of the <HI>Alps,</HI> and has a long Valley that
&s;eems hewn out on purpo&s;e to give its
Waters a Pa&s;&s;age amid&s;t &s;o many Rocks
and Mountains which are on all Sides
of it. This brings it almo&s;t in a direct
Line to <HI>Geneva.</HI> It would there over|flow
all the Country, were there not
one particular Cleft that divides a va&s;t
<PB N="361" REF="382">
Circuit of Mountains, and conveys it off
to <HI>Lyons.</HI> From <HI>Lyons</HI> there is another
great Rent, which runs acro&s;s the whole
Country in almo&s;t another &s;treight Line,
and notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t height of
the Mountains that ri&s;e about it, gives
it the &s;horte&s;t Cour&s;e it can take to fall
into the Sea. Had &s;uch a River as this
been left to it &s;elf to have found its way
out from among the <HI>Alps,</HI> whatever
Windings it had made it mu&s;t have for|med
&s;everal little Seas, and have laid ma|ny
Countries under Water before it had
come to the End of its Cour&s;e. I &s;hall
not make any Remarks upon <HI>Geneva,</HI>
that is a Republick &s;o well known to
the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> It lyes at pre&s;ent under
&s;ome Difficulties by rea&s;on of the Em|peror's
Di&s;plea&s;ure, who has forbidden
the Importation of their Manufactures
into any Part of the Empire, which
will certainly rai&s;e a Sedition among the
People, unle&s;s the Magi&s;trates find &s;ome
way to remedy it: and they &s;ay it is al|ready
done by the Interpo&s;ition of the
States of <HI>Holland.</HI> The Occa&s;ion of the
Emperor's Prohibition was their furni&s;h|ing
great Sums to the King of <HI>France</HI>
for the Payment of his Army in <HI>Italy.</HI>
They obliged them&s;elves to remit, after
the rate of Twelve Hundred Thou&s;and
<PB N="362" REF="383">
Pounds Sterling, <HI>per Annum,</HI> divided in|to
&s;o many Monthly Payments. As the
Intere&s;t was very great, &s;everal of the
Merchants of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who would not
tru&s;t their King in their own Names,
are &s;aid to have contributed a great
deal under the Names of <HI>Geneva</HI>
Merchants. The Republick fancies
it &s;elf hardly treated by the Em|peror,
&s;ince it is not any Action of the
State, but a Compact among private
Per&s;ons that hath furni&s;hed out the&s;e &s;e|veral
Remittances. They pretend how|ever
to have put a &s;top to them, and by
that means are in hopes again to open
their Commerce into the Empire.</P>

<P>_FROM <HI>Geneva</HI> I travelled to
<HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI> and thence to <HI>Fri|bourg,</HI>
which is but a mean
Town for the Capital of &s;o
large a Canton: Its Situati|on
is &s;o irregular, that they are forced
to climb up to &s;everal Parts of it by
Stair-Ca&s;es of a prodigious A&s;cent. This
Inconvenience however gives them a ve|ry
great Commodity in ca&s;e a Fire breaks
out in any Part of the Town, for by
rea&s;on of &s;everal Re&s;ervoirs on the Tops
of the&s;e Mountains, by the opening of
a Sluce they convey a River into what
Part of the Town they plea&s;e. They
have Four Churches, Four Convents of
Women, and as many for Men. The
little Chappel, called the <HI>Salutation,</HI> is
very neat, and built with a pretty Fancy.
The College of Je&s;uits is, they &s;ay, the
fine&s;t in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> There is a great
<PB N="364" REF="385">
deal of Room in it, and &s;everal beauti|ful
Views from the different Parts of it.
They have a Collection of Pictures re|pre&s;enting
mo&s;t of the Fathers of their
Order, who have been Eminent for
their Piety or Learning. Among the
re&s;t many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men whom we name
Rebels, and they Martyrs. <HI>Henry Gar|net</HI>'s
In&s;cription &s;ays, That when the
Hereticks could not prevail with him,
either by Force or Promi&s;es, to change
his Religion, they Hanged and Quarte|red
him. At the <HI>Capucins</HI> I &s;aw the E&s;|cargatoire,
which I took the more no|tice
of becau&s;e I do not remember to
have met with any thing of the &s;ame in
other Countries. It is a &s;quare Place
boarded in, and filled with a va&s;t quan|tity
of large Snails, that are e&s;teemed
excellent Food when they are well dre&s;|&s;ed.
The Floor is &s;trowed about half a
Foot deep with &s;everal kinds of Plants,
among which the Snails ne&s;tle all the
Winter Sea&s;on. When <HI>Lent</HI> arrives they
open their Magazines, and take out of
them the be&s;t meagre Food in the
World, for there is no Di&s;h of Fi&s;h
that they reckon comparable to a Ra|go&ucirc;t
of Snails.</P>
<P>About Two Leagues from <HI>Fribourg</HI>
we went to &s;ee a Hermitage, that is
<PB N="365" REF="386">
reckon'd the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity of the&s;e
Parts. It lyes in the prettie&s;t Solitude
imaginable, among Woods and Rocks,
which at fir&s;t Sight di&s;po&s;e a Man to be
&s;erious. There has lived in it a Hermite
the&s;e Five and Twenty Years, who with
his own Hands has worked in the Rock
a pretty Chappel, a Sacri&s;tie, a Chamber,
Kitchin, Cellar, and other Convenien|ces.
His Chimney is carry'd up through
the whole Rock, &s;o that you &s;ee
the Sky through it, notwith&s;tanding
the Rooms lye very deep. He has cut
the Side of the Rock into a Flat for a
Garden, and by laying on it the wa&s;te
Earth that he has found in &s;everal of
the neighbouring Parts, has made &s;uch
a Spot of Ground of it as furni&s;hes out
a kind of Luxury for a Hermite. As
he &s;aw Drops of Water di&s;tilling from
&s;everal Parts of the Rock, by following
the Veins of them, he has made him|&s;elf
Two or Three Fountains in the
Bowels of the Mountain, that &s;erve his
Table, and water his little Garden.</P>
<P>We had very bad Ways from hence
to <HI>Bern,</HI> a great Part of them through
Woods of Fir-trees. The great Quan|tity
of Timber they have in this Coun|try
makes them mend their High-ways
with Wood in&s;tead of Stone. I could
<PB N="366" REF="387">
not but take notice of the Make of &s;e|veral
of their Barns I here &s;aw. After
having laid a Frame of Wood for the
Foundation, they place at the Four
Corners of it Four huge Blocks; cut
in &s;uch a Shape as neither Mice nor a|ny
other &s;ort of Vermin can creep up
the Sides of them, at the &s;ame time that
they rai&s;e the Corn above the Moi&s;ture
that might come into it from the Ground.
The whole weight of the Barn is &s;up|ported
by the&s;e Four Blocks.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ed me mo&s;t at <HI>Bern</HI> was
their publick Walks by the Great
Church. They are rai&s;ed extremely
high, and that their Weight might not
break down the Walls and Pila&s;ters
which &s;urround them, they are built
upon Arches and Vaults. Tho' they are,
I believe, as high as mo&s;t Steeples in
<HI>England</HI> from the Streets and Gardens
that lye at the Foot of them, yet about
Forty Years ago a Per&s;on in his Drink
fell down from the very Top to the Bot|tom,
without doing him&s;elf any other
Hurt than the Breaking of an Arm.
He dy'd about Four Years ago. There
is the noble&s;t Summer-Pro&s;pect in the
World from this Walk, for you have
a full View of a huge Range of Moun|tains
that lye in the Country of the <HI>Gri|&s;ons,</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="388">
and are bury'd in Snow. They
are about Twenty Five Leagues di&s;tance
from the Town, though by Rea&s;on of
their Height and their Colour they &s;eem
much nearer. The Cathedral Church
&s;tands on one &s;ide of the&s;e Walks, and
is perhaps the mo&s;t Magnificent of any
Prote&s;tant Church in <HI>Europe</HI> out of
<HI>England.</HI> It is a very bold Work, and
a Ma&s;ter-piece in <HI>Gothic</HI> Architecture.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Ar&s;enal of <HI>Bern,</HI> where
they &s;ay there are Arms for Twenty
Thou&s;and Men. There is indeed no
great Plea&s;ure in vi&s;iting the&s;e Maga|zines
of War after one has &s;een Two
or Three of them, yet it is very well
worth a Traveller's while to look into
all that lye in his Way; for be&s;ides the
Idea it gives him of the Forces of a
State, it &s;erves to fix in his Mind the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Parts of its Hi&s;tory.
Thus in that of <HI>Geneva</HI> one meets with
the Ladders, Petard, and other Uten&s;ils
which were made u&s;e of in their Fa|mous
E&s;calade, be&s;ides the Weapons they
took of the <HI>Savoyards, Florentines,</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> in the &s;everal Battels mentioned
in their Hi&s;tory. In this of <HI>Bern</HI> you
have the Figure and Armour of the
Count who founded the Town, of the
Famous <HI>Tell,</HI> who is repre&s;ented as &s;hoot|ing

The Story is too well known to be re|peated
in this Place. I here likewi&s;e
&s;aw the Figure and Armour of him that
headed the Pea&s;ants in the War upon
<HI>Bern,</HI> with the &s;everal Weapons which
were found in the Hands of his Follow|ers.
They &s;how too abundance of Arms
that they took from the <HI>Burgundians</HI> in the
Three great Battels which e&s;tabli&s;h'd
them in their Library, and de&s;troy'd the
Great Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> him&s;elf, with
the brave&s;t of his Subjects. I &s;aw no|thing
remarkable in the Chambers where
the Council meet, nor in the Fortifica|tions
of the Town. The&s;e la&s;t were
made on Occa&s;ion of the Pea&s;ants In|&s;urrection,
to defend the Place for the
future again&s;t the like &s;udden A&s;&s;aults.
In their Liberty I ob&s;erved a couple of
antique Figures in Metal, of a Prie&s;t
pouring Wine between the Horns of a
Bull. The Prie&s;t is veil'd after the
manner of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrificers, and
is repre&s;ented in the &s;ame Action that
<HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes in the Third <HI>Aeneid.</HI><Q><L>Ip&s;a tenens dextr&acirc; pateram pulcherrima
Dido</L>
<L>Candentis vaccae media inter cornua fun|dit.</L></Q><PB N="369" REF="390">
This Antiquity was found at <HI>Lau&s;anne.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Bern</HI> is plentifully fur|ni&s;h'd
with Water, there being a great
Multitude of hand&s;ome Fountains plan|ted
at &s;et Di&s;tances from one End of the
Streets to the other. There is indeed
no Country in the World better &s;up|ply'd
with Water, than the &s;everal Parts
of <HI>Switzerland</HI> that I travell'd through.
One meets every where in the Roads
with Fountains continually running in|to
huge Troughs that &s;tand underneath
them, which is wonderfully commodi|ous
in a Country that &s;o much abounds
with Hor&s;es and Cattle. It has &s;o ma|ny
Springs breaking out of the Sides of
the Hills, and &s;uch va&s;t Quantities of
Wood to make Pipes of, that it is no
Wonder they are &s;o well &s;tock'd with
Fountains.</P>
<P>On the Road between <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>So|leurre</HI>
there is a Monument erected by the
Republick of <HI>Bern,</HI> which tells us the
Story of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, who is not to
be met with in any of our own Wri|ters.
The In&s;cription is in <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;e
on one &s;ide of the Stone, and in <HI>Ger|man</HI>
on the other. I had not Time to
Copy it, but the Sub&s;tance of it is this.<Q>One <HI>Cu&s;&s;inus,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, to
whom the Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> had giv|en
<PB N="370" REF="391">
his Si&s;ter in Marriage, came to
take her from among the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> by
Force of Arms, but after having ra|vaged
the Country for &s;ome time, he
was here overthrown by the Can|ton
of <HI>Bern.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Soleurre</HI> is our next con&s;iderable Town,
that &s;eemed to me to have a greater Air
of Politene&s;s than any I &s;aw in <HI>Switzer|land.</HI>
The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador has his
Re&s;idence in this Place. His Ma&s;ter
contributed a great Sum of Mony to
the Je&s;uits Church, which is not yet quite
fini&s;hed. It is the fine&s;t Modern Build|ing
in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The old Cathedral
Church &s;tood not far from it. At the
A&s;cent that leads to it are a couple of an|tique
Pillars which belonged to an old
Heathen Temple, Dedicated to <HI>Hermes</HI>:
They &s;eem <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> by their Proportion.
The whole Fortification of <HI>Soleurre</HI> is
faced with Marble. But its be&s;t Forti|fications
are the high Mountains that
lye within its Neighbourhood, and &s;epa|rate
it from the <HI>Franche Compt&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day's Journey carry'd us
through other Parts of the Canton of
<HI>Bern,</HI> to the little Town of <HI>Meldingen.</HI>
I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find in all my Road
through <HI>Switzerland,</HI> the Wine that
grows in the Country of <HI>Vaud</HI> on the
<PB N="371" REF="392">
Borders of the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> which
is very cheap, notwith&s;tanding the great
Di&s;tance between the Vineyards and the
Towns that &s;ell the Wine. But the Na|vigable
Rivers of <HI>Switzerland</HI> are as
commodious to them in this Re&s;pect, as
the Sea is to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> As &s;oon as
the Vintage is over, they Ship off their
Wine upon the Lake, which furni&s;hes
all the Towns that lye upon its Borders.
What they de&s;ign for other Parts of the
Country they unload at <HI>Very,</HI> and after
about half a Day's Land-Carriage con|vey
it into the River <HI>Aar,</HI> which brings
it down the Stream to <HI>Bern, Soleurre,</HI>
and, in a Word, di&s;tributes it through
all the riche&s;t Parts of <HI>Switzerland</HI>; as
it is ea&s;ie to gue&s;s from the fir&s;t &s;ight of
the Map, which &s;hows us the natural
Communication Providence has formed
between the many Rivers and Lakes of a
Country that is at &s;o great a di&s;tance from
the Sea. The Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> is rec|koned
as powerful as all the re&s;t together.
They can &s;end a Hundred Thou&s;and Men
into the Field; tho' the Soldiers of the
Catholick Cantons, who are much poor|er,
and therefore forced to enter oftner
into Foreign Armies, are more e&s;teemed
than the Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="393">
We lay one Night at <HI>Meldingen,</HI> which
is a little <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Town with
one Church, and no Convent. It is a
Republick of it &s;elf under the Protecti|on
of the Eight ancient Cantons. There
are in it a Hundred Bourgeois, and about
a Thou&s;and Souls. Their Government
is modelled after the &s;ame manner with
that of the Cantons, as much as &s;o &s;mall
a Community can imitate tho&s;e of &s;o
large an Extent. For this Rea&s;on though
they have very little Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, they
have all the Variety of Councils and Of|ficers
that are to be met with in the
greater States. They have a Town-Hou&s;e
to meet in, adorn'd with the Arms
of the Eight Cantons their Protectors.
They have Three Councils, the Great
Council of Fourteen, the Little Coun|cil
of Ten, and the Privy Council of
Three. The chief of the State are the
Two Avoyers: When I was there the
Reigning Avoyer, or Doge of the Com|monwealth,
was Son to the Inn where
I was lodged. His Father having enjoy'd
the &s;ame Honours before him. His Re|venue
amounts to about Thirty Pound a
Year. The &s;everal Councils meet every
<HI>Thur&s;day</HI> upon Affairs of State, &s;uch as
the Reparation of a Trough, the mend|ing
of a Pavement, or any the like
<PB N="373" REF="394">
Matters of Importance. The River that
runs through their Dominions puts them
to the Charge of a very large Bridge,
that is all made of Wood, and coped
over Head, like the re&s;t in <HI>Switzerland.</HI>
Tho&s;e that travel over it pay a certain
Due towards the Maintenance of this
Bridge. And as the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador
has often occa&s;ion to pa&s;s this way, his
Ma&s;ter gives the Town a Pen&s;ion of
Twenty Pound Sterling, which makes
them extremely indu&s;trious to rai&s;e all
the Men they can for his Service, and
keeps this powerful Republick firm to
the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t. You may be &s;ure
the Pre&s;erving of the Bridge, with
the Regulation of the Dues ari&s;ing
from it, is the grand Affair that cuts out
Employment for the &s;everal Councils of
State. They have a &s;mall Village be|longing
to them, whither they punctu|ally
&s;end a Bailiff for the Di&s;tribution of
Ju&s;tice; in Imitation &s;till of the Great Can|tons.
There are Three other Towns that
have the &s;ame Privileges and Protectors.</P>
<P>We Dined the next Day at <HI>Zurich,</HI>
that is prettily &s;ituated on the Out-let
of the Lake, and is reckoned the hand|&s;ome&s;t
Town in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The chief
Places &s;hown to Strangers are the Ar&s;e|nal,
the Library, and the Town-Hou&s;e.
<PB N="374" REF="395">
This la&s;t is but lately fini&s;hed, and is a
very fine Pile of Building. The Fron|ti&s;piece
has Pillars of a beautiful Black
Marble &s;treaked with White, which is
found in the neighbouring Mountains.
The Chambers for the &s;everal Councils,
with the other Apartments are very neat.
The whole Building is indeed &s;o well de|&s;igned,
that it would make a good Figure
even in <HI>Italy.</HI> It is pity they have &s;poil'd
the Beauty of the Walls with abundance
of childi&s;h <HI>Latin</HI> Sentences, that con&s;i&s;t
often in a Jingle of Words. I have in|deed
ob&s;erved in &s;everal In&s;criptions of
this Country, that your Men of Learn|ing
here are extremely delighted in play|ing
little Tricks with Words and Fi|gures;
for your <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Wits are not yet
got out of Anagram and Acro&s;tick. The
Library is a very large Room, pretty well
filled. Over it is another Room fur|ni&s;hed
with &s;everal artificial and natural
Curio&s;ities. I &s;aw in it a huge Map of
the whole Country of <HI>Zurich</HI> drawn
with a Pen&s;il, where they &s;ee eve|ry
particular Fountain and Hillock in
their Dominions. I ran over their Ca|binet
of Medals, but don't remember
to have met with any in it that are ex|traordinary
rare. The Ar&s;enal is better
than that of <HI>Bern,</HI> and they &s;ay has Arms
<PB N="375" REF="396">
for Thirty Thou&s;and Men. At about a
Day's Journey from <HI>Zurich</HI> we entered
on the Territories of the Abbot of St.
<HI>Gaul.</HI> They are Four Hours Riding in
Breadth, and Twelve in Length. The
Abbot can rai&s;e in it an Army of Twelve
Thou&s;and Men well armed and exerci&s;ed.
He is Soveraign of the whole Country,
and under the Protection of the Cantons
of <HI>Zurich, Lucerne, Glaris</HI> and <HI>Switz.</HI>
He is always cho&s;en out of the Abby of
<HI>Benedictines</HI> at St. <HI>Gaul.</HI> Every Father
and Brother of the Convent has a Voice
in the Election, which mu&s;t afterwards
be confirmed by the Pope. The la&s;t
Abbot was Cardinal <HI>Sfondrati,</HI> who was
advanced to the Purple about Two
Years before his Death. The Abbot
takes the Advice and Con&s;ent of his
Chapter before he enters on any Matter
of Importance, as the levying of a Tax,
or declaring of a War. His chief Lay-Officer
is the Grand <HI>Ma&icirc;tre d' H&ocirc;tel,</HI> or
High-Steward of the Hou&s;hold, who
is named by the Abbot, and has the Ma|nagement
of all Affairs under him.
There are &s;everal other Judges and Di|&s;tributers
of Ju&s;tice appointed for the &s;e|veral
Parts of his Dominions, from
whom there always lyes an Appeal to
the Prince. His Re&s;idence is gene|raliy
at the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Convent at
<PB N="376" REF="397">
St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Town of
St. <HI>Gaul</HI> is a little Prote&s;tant Republick,
wholly independent of the Abbot, and
under the Protection of the Cantons.</P>
<P>One would wonder to &s;ee &s;o many
rich Bourgeois in the Town of St. <HI>Gaul,</HI>
and &s;o very few poor People in a Place
that has &s;carce any Lands belonging to
it, and little or no Income but what
ari&s;es from its Trade. But the great
Support and Riches of this little State is
its Linnen Manufacture, which employs
almo&s;t all Ages and Conditions of its
Inhabitants. The whole Country about
them furni&s;hes them with va&s;t Quanti|ties
of Flax, out of which they are &s;aid
to make yearly Forty Thou&s;and Pieces
of Linnen Cloath, reckoning Two Hun|dred
Ells to the Piece. Some of their
Manufacture is as finely wrought as any
that can be met with in <HI>Holland</HI>; for
they have Excellent Artizans, and great
Commodities for Whitening. All the
Fields about the Town were &s;o covered
with their Manufacture, that com|ing
in the Dusk of the Evening we
mi&s;took them for a Lake. They &s;end off
their Works upon Mules into <HI>Italy,</HI>
<HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and all the adjacent
Countries. They reckon in the Town
of St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> and in the Hou&s;es that lye
&s;cattered about it, near Ten Thou&s;and
<PB N="377" REF="398">
Souls, of which there are Sixteen Hun|dred
Burgeois. They chu&s;e their Coun|cils
and Burgo-Ma&s;ters out of the Body
of the Burgeois, as in the other Govern|ments
of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which are every
where of the &s;ame Nature, the diffe|rence
lying only in the Numbers of
&s;uch as are employed in State Affairs,
which are proportioned to the Grandeur
of the States that employ them. The
Abby and the Town bear a great Aver|&s;ion
to one another; but in the General
Diet of the Cantons their Repre&s;entatives
&s;it together, and act by Concert. The
Abbot deputes his <HI>Grand Ma&icirc;tre d' H&ocirc;|tel,</HI>
and the Town one of its Burgo-Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>About Four Years ago the Town and
Abby wou'd have come to an open Rup|ture,
had it not been timely prevented by
the Interpo&s;ition of their common Pro|tectors.
The Occa&s;ion was this, A <HI>Bene|dictine</HI>
Monk, in one of their annual Pro|ce&s;&s;ions,
carried his Cro&s;s erected through
the Town with a Train of Three or
Four Thou&s;and Pea&s;ants following him.
They had no &s;ooner entered the Convent
but the whole Town was in a Tumult,
occa&s;ion'd by the In&s;olence of the Prie&s;t,
who, contrary to all Precedents, had
pre&s;umed to carry his Cro&s;s in that
<PB N="378" REF="399">
manner. The Burgeois immediately put
them&s;elves in Arms, and drew down
Four Pieces of their Cannon to the
Gates of the Convent. The Proce&s;&s;ion
to e&s;cape the Fury of the Citizens dur&s;t
not return by the Way it came, but af|ter
the Devotions of the Monks were
fini&s;h'd, pa&s;s'd out at a Back-door of
the Convent, that immediately led into
the Abbot's Territories. The Abbot on
his Part rai&s;es an Army, blocks up the
Town on the Side that faces his Domi|nions,
and forbids his Subjects to fur|ni&s;h
it with any of their Commodities.
While things were ju&s;t ripe for a War,
the Cantons, their Protectors, inter|pos'd
as Umpires in the Quarrel, con|demning
the Town that had appear'd
too forward in the Di&s;pute to a Fine of
Two Thou&s;and Crowns; and Enacting
at the &s;ame time, That as &s;oon as any
Proce&s;&s;ion enter'd their Walls, the Prie&s;t
&s;hould let the Cro&s;s hang about his
Neck without touching it with either
Hand, 'till he came within the Precincts
of the Abby. The Citizens could bring
into the Field near Two Thou&s;and Men
well exercis'd, and arm'd to the be&s;t
Advantage, with which they fancy they
could make Head again&s;t Twelve or
Fifteen Thou&s;and Pea&s;ants, for &s;o many
<PB N="379" REF="400">
the Abbot could ea&s;ily rai&s;e in his Ter|ritories.
But the Prote&s;tant Subjects of
the Abby, who they &s;ay make up a good
Third of its People, would probably, in
ca&s;e of a War, abandon the Cau&s;e of
their Prince for that of their Religion.
The Town of St. <HI>Gaul</HI> has an Ar&s;enal,
Library, Town-Hou&s;es, and Churches
proportionable to the Bigne&s;s of the
State. It is well enough fortify'd to re|&s;i&s;t
any &s;udden Attack, and to give the
Cantons time to come to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance.
The Abby is by no means &s;o
Magnificent as one would expect from
its Endowments. The Church is one
huge Nef with a double Ai&s;le to it. At
each End is a large Quire. The one of
them is &s;upported by va&s;t Pillars of
Stone, cas'd over with a Compo&s;ition
that looks the mo&s;t like Marble of any
thing one can imagine. On the Cieling
and Walls of the Church are Li&s;ts of
Saints, Martyrs, Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Bi&s;hops,
Kings and Queens that have
been of the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Order. There
are &s;everal Pictures of &s;uch as have been
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Birth, Sanctity, or
Miracles, with In&s;criptions that let you
into the Name and Hi&s;tory of the Per|&s;ons
repre&s;ented. I have often wi&s;h'd
that &s;ome Traveller would take the Pains
<PB N="380" REF="401">
to gather together all the Modern In|&s;criptions
which are to be met with in
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Countries, as <HI>Gruter</HI>
and others have copy'd out the ancient
Heathen Monuments. Had we Two
or Three Volumes of this Nature, with|out
any of the Collector's own Refle|ctions,
I am &s;ure there is nothing in the
World could give a truer Idea of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, nor expo&s;e
more the Pride, Vanity and Self-Inte|re&s;t
of Convents, the Abu&s;e of Indul|gencies,
the Folly and Impertinence of
Votaries, and in &s;hort the Super&s;tition,
Credulity, and Childi&s;hne&s;s of the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Catholick Religion. One might
fill &s;everal Sheets at St. <HI>Gaul,</HI> as there
are few con&s;iderable Convents or
Churches that would not afford large
Contributions.</P>
<P>As the King of <HI>France</HI> di&s;tributes his
Pen&s;ions through all the Parts of <HI>Swit|zerland,</HI>
the Town and Abby of St. <HI>Gaul</HI>
come in too for their Share. To the
Fir&s;t he gives Five Hundred Crowns
<HI>per Annum,</HI> and to the other a Thou|&s;and.
This Pen&s;ion has not been paid
the&s;e Three Years, which they attribute
to their not acknowledging the Duke
of <HI>Anjou</HI> for King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Town
and Abby of St. <HI>Gaul</HI> carry a Bear for
<PB N="381" REF="402">
their Arms. The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks
have this Bear's Memory in very great
Veneration, and repre&s;ent him as the
fir&s;t Convert their Saint made in the
Country. One of the mo&s;t Learned of
the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks gave me the fol|lowing
Hi&s;tory of him, which he deli|ver'd
to me with Tears of Affection in
his Eyes. St. <HI>Gaul</HI> it &s;eems, whom they
call the great Apo&s;tle of <HI>Germany,</HI> found
all this Country little better than a va&s;t
De&s;art. As he was walking in it on a
very cold Day he chanc'd to meet a Bear
in his Way. The Saint, in&s;tead of be|ing
&s;tartled at the Rencounter, order'd
the Bear to bring him a Bundle of Wood,
and make him a Fire. The Bear &s;erv'd
him to the be&s;t of his Ability, and at
his Departure was commanded by the
Saint to retire into the very Depth of
the Woods, and there to pa&s;s the re&s;t of
his Life without ever hurting Man or
Bea&s;t. From this time, &s;ays the Monk,
the Bear liv'd irreproachably, and ob|&s;erv'd
to his dying Day the Orders that
the Saint had given him.</P>
<P>I have often con&s;ider'd, with a great
deal of Plea&s;ure, the profound Peace
and Tranquillity that reigns in <HI>Switzer|land</HI>
and its Alliances. It is very won|derful
to &s;ee &s;uch a Knot of Govern|ments,
<PB N="382" REF="403">
which are &s;o divided among them|&s;elves
in Matters of Religion, maintain
&s;o uninterrupted an Union and Corre|&s;pondance,
that no one of them is for
Invading the Rights of another, but re|mains
content within the Bounds of its
Fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment. This, I think, mu&s;t
be chiefly a&s;cribed to the Nature of the
People, and the Con&s;titution of their
Governments. Were the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> animated
by Zeal or Ambition, &s;ome or other of
their States would immediately break in
upon the re&s;t; or were the States &s;o ma|ny
Principalities, they might often have
an ambitious Soveraign at the Head of
them, that would embroil his Neigh|bours,
and &s;acrifice the Repo&s;e of his
Subjects to his own Glory. But as the In|habitants
of the&s;e Countries are naturally
of a heavy Phlegmatick Temper, if any
of their leading Members have more Fire
and Spirit than comes to their Share, it
is quickly temper'd by the Coldne&s;s and
Moderation of the re&s;t who &s;it at the
Helm with them. To this we may add,
that the <HI>Alps</HI> is the wor&s;t Spot of
Ground in the World to make Conque&s;ts
in, a great Part of its Governments be|ing
&s;o naturally intrench'd among Woods
and Mountains. However it be, we
find no &s;uch Di&s;orders among them as
<PB N="383" REF="404">
one would expect in &s;uch a Multitude
of States; for as &s;oon as any Publick
Rupture happens, it is immediately clos'd
up by the Moderation and good Offices
of the re&s;t that interpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As all the con&s;iderable Governments
among the <HI>Alps</HI> are Common-wealths,
&s;o indeed it is a Con&s;titution the mo&s;t
adapted of any other to the Poverty
and Barrenne&s;s of the&s;e Countries. We
may &s;ee only in a neighbouring Govern|ment
the ill Con&s;equences of having a
De&s;potic Prince, in a State that is mo&s;t
of it compo&s;ed of Rocks and Moun|tains;
for notwith&s;tanding there is a
va&s;t Extent of Lands, and many of them
better than tho&s;e of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and <HI>Gri|&s;ons,</HI>
the common People, among the
latter, are much more at their Ea&s;e, and
in a greater Affluence of all the Conve|niences
of Life. A Prince's Court eats
too much into the Income of a poor
State, and generally introduces a kind
of Luxury and Magnificence, that &s;ets
every particular Per&s;on upon making a
higher Figure in his Station than is ge|nerally
con&s;i&s;tent with his Revenue.</P>
<P>It is the great Endeavour of the &s;e|veral
Cantons of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> to bani&s;h
from among them every thing that looks
like Pomp or Superfluity. To this End
<PB N="384" REF="405">
the Mini&s;ters are always Preaching, and
the Governors putting out Edicts again&s;t
Dancing, Gaming, Entertainments, and
fine Cloaths. This is become more ne|ce&s;&s;ary
in &s;ome of the Governments,
&s;ince there are &s;o many Refugees &s;ettled
among them; for tho' the Prote&s;tants
in <HI>France</HI> affect ordinarily a greater Plain|ne&s;s
and Simplicity of Manners, than
tho&s;e of the &s;ame Quality who are of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Communion, they
have however too much of their Coun|try-Gallantry
for the Genius and Con|&s;titution
of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> Should Dre&s;|&s;ing,
Fea&s;ting, and Balls once get among
the Cantons, their Military Roughne&s;s
would be quickly lo&s;t, their Tempers
would grow too &s;oft for their Climate,
and their Expences out-run their In|comes,
be&s;ides that the Materials for
their Luxury mu&s;t be brought from o|ther
Nations, which would immediate|ly
ruin a Country that has few Commo|dities
of its own to export, and is not
over-&s;tock'd with Mony. Luxury in|deed
wounds a Republick in its very Vi|tals,
as its natural Con&s;equences are Ra|pine,
Avarice and Inju&s;tice; for the
more Mony a Man &s;pends, the more
mu&s;t he endeavour to augment his
Stock; which at la&s;t &s;ets the Liberty
<PB N="385" REF="406">
and Votes of a Common-wealth to Sale,
if they find any Foreign Power that is
able to pay the Price of them. We &s;ee no
where the pernicious Effects of Luxury
on a Republick more than in that of
the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> who immediately
found it &s;elf poor as &s;oon as this Vice
got Footing among them, though they
were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all the Riches in the
World. We find in the Beginnings
and Increa&s;es of their Common-wealth
&s;trange In&s;tances of the Contempt of
Mony, becau&s;e indeed they were utter
Strangers to the Plea&s;ures that might be
procured by it; or in other Words, be|cau&s;e
they were wholly ignorant of the
Arts of Luxury. But as &s;oon as they
once enter'd into a Ta&s;te of Plea&s;ure,
Politene&s;s and Magnificence, they fell
into a Thou&s;and Violences, Con&s;pira|cies,
and Divi&s;ions that threw them in|to
all the Di&s;orders imaginable, and ter|minated
in the utter Subver&s;ion of the
Common-wealth. It is no wonder there|fore
the poor Common-wealths of <HI>Swit|zerland</HI>
are ever labouring at the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion
and Prohibition of every thing
that may introduce Vanity and Luxury.
Be&s;ide the &s;everal Fines that are &s;et up|on
Plays, Games, Balls and Fea&s;tings,
they have many Cu&s;toms among them
<PB N="386" REF="407">
which very much contribute to the
keeping up of their ancient Simplicity.
The Bourgeois, who are at the Head
of the Governments, are obliged to ap|pear
at all their publick A&s;&s;emblies in a
Black Cloak and a Band. The Wo|mens
Dre&s;s is very plain, tho&s;e of the
be&s;t Quality wearing nothing on their
Heads generally but Furs, which are to
be met with in their own Country.
The Per&s;ons of different Qualities in
both Sexes are indeed allowed their dif|ferent
Ornaments, but the&s;e are gene|rally
&s;uch as are by no means co&s;tly, be|ing
rather de&s;igned as Marks of Di|&s;tinction
than to make a Figure. The
chief Officers of <HI>Bern,</HI> for Example,
are known by the Crowns of their Hats,
which are much deeper than tho&s;e of
an inferior Character. The Pea&s;ants are
generally cloathed in a coar&s;e kind of
Canvas, that is the Manufacture of the
Country. Their Holy-day Cloaths go
from Father to Son, and are &s;eldom worn
out, 'till the Second or Third Genera|tion:
So that it is common enough to
&s;ee a Countryman in the Doublet and
Breeches of his Great-grand-father.</P>
<P><HI>Geneva</HI> is much politer than <HI>Switzer|land,</HI>
or any of its Allies, and is there|fore
looked upon as the Court of the
<PB N="387" REF="408">
<HI>Alps,</HI> whither the Prote&s;tant Cantons
often &s;end their Children to improve
them&s;elves in Language and Education.
The <HI>Genevois</HI> have been very much re|fin'd,
or as others will have it, corrup|ted
by the Conver&s;ation of the <HI>French</HI>
Prote&s;tants, who make up almo&s;t a Third
of their People. It is certain they have
very much forgotten the Advice that
<HI>Calvin</HI> gave them in a great Council a
little before his Death, when he recom|mended
to them, above all Things, an
Exemplary Mode&s;ty and Humility, and
as great a Simplicity in their Manners
as in their Religion. Whether or no
they have done well, to &s;et up for mak|ing
another kind of Figure, Time will
witne&s;s. There are &s;everal that fancy
the great Sums they have remitted into
<HI>Italy,</HI> though by this means they make
their Court to the King of <HI>France</HI> at
pre&s;ent, may &s;ome time or other give
him an Inclination to become the Ma|&s;ter
of &s;o wealthy a City.</P>
<P>As this Collection of little States a|bounds
more in Pa&s;turage than in Corn,
they are all provided with their pub|lick
Granaries, and have the Humanity
to furni&s;h one another in publick Exi|gencies,
when the Scarcity is not Uni|ver&s;al.
As the Admini&s;tration of Af|fairs
<PB N="388" REF="409">
relating to the&s;e publick Grana|ries,
is not very different in any of the
particular Governments, I &s;hall content
my &s;elf to &s;et down the Rules ob&s;erved
in it by the little Common-wealth of
<HI>Geneva,</HI> in which I had more Time to
inform my &s;elf of the Particulars than
in any other. There are Three of the
Little Council deputed for this Office.
They are obliged to keep together a
Provi&s;ion &s;ufficient to feed the People
at lea&s;t Two Years, in ca&s;e of War or
Famine. They mu&s;t take care to fill
their Magazines in Times of the great|e&s;t
Plenty, that &s;o they may afford cheap|er,
and increa&s;e the publick Revenue
at a &s;mall Expence of its Members.
None of the Three Managers mu&s;t, up|on
any Pretence, furni&s;h the Granaries
from his own Fields, that &s;o they may
have no Temptation to pay too great
a Price, or put any bad Corn upon the
Publick. They mu&s;t buy up no Corn
growing within Twelve Miles of <HI>Ge|neva,</HI>
that &s;o the filling of their Maga|zines
may not prejudice their Mar|ket,
and rai&s;e the Price of their Provi|&s;ions
at Home. That &s;uch a Collection
of Corn may not &s;poil in keeping, all
the Inns and Publick-Hou&s;es are obliged
to furni&s;h them&s;elves out of it, by which
means is rai&s;ed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="389" REF="410">
Branch of the publick Revenues; the
Corn being &s;old out at a much dearer
Rate than 'tis bought up. So that the
greate&s;t Income of the Common-wealth,
which pays the Pen&s;ions of mo&s;t of
its Officers and Mini&s;ters, is rai&s;ed on
Strangers and Travellers, or &s;uch of their
own Body as have Mony enough to
&s;pend at Taverns and Publick-Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Swit|zerland</HI>
to divide their E&s;tates equally
among all their Children, by which
means every one lives at his Ea&s;e with|out
growing dangerous to the Repub|lick,
for as &s;oon as an overgrown E|&s;tate
falls into the Hands of one that
has many Children, it is broken into &s;o
many Portions as render the Sharers of
it Rich enough, without rai&s;ing them
too much above the Level of the re&s;t.
This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e lit|tle
Republicks, where the Rich Mer|chants
live very much within their E|&s;tates,
and by heaping up va&s;t Sums
from Year to Year might become for|midable
to the re&s;t of their Fellow-Ci|tizens,
and break the Equality, which is
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e kinds of Govern|ments,
were there not means found out
to di&s;tribute their Wealth among &s;eve|ral
Members of their Republick. At
<HI>Geneva,</HI> for In&s;tance, are Merchants
<PB N="390" REF="411">
reckon'd worth Twenty Hundred Thou|&s;and
Crowns, though, perhaps, there
is not one of them who &s;pends to the
value of Five Hundred Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>Though the Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts
know very well that it is their com|mon
Intere&s;t to keep a &s;teddy Neutra|lity
in all the Wars between the States
of <HI>Europe,</HI> they cannot forbear &s;iding
with a Party in their Di&s;cour&s;e. The
Catholicks are zealous for the <HI>French</HI>
King, as the Prote&s;tants do not a little
glory in the Riches, Power, and good
Succe&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> whom
they look upon as the Bulwarks of the
Reformation. The Mini&s;ters in parti|cular,
have often preached again&s;t &s;uch
of their Fellow-Subjects as enter into
the Troops of the <HI>French</HI> King; but &s;o
long as the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> &s;ee their Intere&s;t in it,
their Poverty will always hold them
fa&s;t to his Service. They have indeed
the Exerci&s;e of their Religion, and
their Mini&s;ters with them, which is the
more remarkable, becau&s;e the very &s;ame
Prince, refu&s;ed even tho&s;e of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> who follow'd their Ma&s;ter
to St. <HI>Germains,</HI> the publick Exerci&s;e
of their Religion.</P>
<P>Before I leave <HI>Switzerland</HI> I cannot
but ob&s;erve, that the Notion of Witch|craft
<PB N="391" REF="412">
reigns very much in this Country.
I have often been tired with Accounts
of this Nature from very &s;en&s;ible Men,
that are mo&s;t of them furni&s;h'd with
Matters of Fact which have happened,
as they pretend, within the compa&s;s of
their own Knowledge. It is certain
there have been many Executions on this
Account, as in the Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> there
were &s;ome put to Death during my
Stay at <HI>Geneva.</HI> The People are &s;o u|niver&s;ally
infatuated with the Notion,
that if a Cow falls &s;ick, it is Ten to
One but an Old Woman is clapt up in
Pri&s;on for it, and if the poor Creature
chance to think her &s;elf a Witch, the
whole Country is for hanging her up
without Mercy. One finds indeed the
&s;ame Humour prevail in mo&s;t of the
rocky Barren Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Whe|ther
it be that Poverty and Ignorance,
which are generally the Products of
the&s;e Countries, may really engage a
Wretch in &s;uch dark Practices, or whe|ther
or no the &s;ame Principles may not
render the People too credulous, and
perhaps too ea&s;y to get rid of &s;ome of
their unprofitable Members.</P>
<P>A great Affair that employs the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI>
Politicks at pre&s;ent is the Prince of <HI>Con|ti</HI>'s
Succe&s;&s;ion to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ne|mours</HI>
<PB N="392" REF="413">
in the Government of <HI>Neuf-Cha|tel.</HI>
The Inhabitants of <HI>Neuf-Chatel</HI> can
by no means think of &s;ubmitting them|&s;elves
to a Prince who is a <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|tholick,
and a Subject of <HI>France.</HI> They
were very attentive to his Conduct in
the Principality of <HI>Orange,</HI> which they
did not que&s;tion but he would Rule with
all the Mildne&s;s and Moderation imagina|ble,
as it would be the be&s;t Means in the
World to recommend him to <HI>Neuf-Cha|tel.</HI>
But notwith&s;tanding it was &s;o much
his Intere&s;t to manage his Prote&s;tant
Subjects in that Country, and the &s;trong
A&s;&s;urances he had given them in pro|tecting
them in all their Privileges, and
particularly in the free Exerci&s;e of their
Religion, he made over his Principality
in a very little time for a Sum of Mony
to the King of <HI>France.</HI> It is indeed ge|nerally
believed the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> would
rather &s;till have kept his Title to <HI>Orange,</HI>
but the &s;ame Re&s;pect which induced him
to quit this Government, might at ano|ther
time tempt him to give up that of
<HI>Neuf-Chatel</HI> on the like Conditions. The
King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> lays in his claim for
<HI>Neuf-Chatel,</HI> as he did for the Principa|lity
of <HI>Orange,</HI> and 'tis probable would
be more acceptable to the Inhabitants
than the other, but they are generally
<PB N="393" REF="414">
di&s;pos'd to declare them&s;elves a Free
Common-wealth, after the Death of the
Dutche&s;s of <HI>Nemours,</HI> if the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> will
&s;upport them. The Prote&s;tant Cantons
&s;eem much inclin'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, which
they may very well do, in ca&s;e the Dut|che&s;s
dies whil&s;t the King of <HI>France</HI> has
his Hands &s;o full of Bu&s;ine&s;s on all &s;ides
of him. It certainly very much concerns
them not to &s;uffer the <HI>French</HI> King to
E&s;tabli&s;h his Authority on this &s;ide
Mount <HI>Jura,</HI> and on the very Borders
of their Country; but it is not ea&s;ie to
fore&s;ee what a round Sum of Mony,
or the Fear of a Rupture with <HI>France,</HI>
may do among a People who have
tamely &s;uffer'd the <HI>Franche Compt&egrave;</HI> to
be &s;eiz'd on, and a Fort to be built
within Cannon-&s;hot of one of their
Cantons.</P>
<P>There is a new Sect &s;prung up in
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> which &s;preads very much
in the Prote&s;tant Cantons. The Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
of it call them&s;elves <HI>Pieti&s;ts,</HI> and
as Enthu&s;ia&s;m carries Men generally to
the like Extravagancies, they differ but
little from &s;everal Sectaries in other
Countries. They pretend in general to
great Refinements, as to what regards
the Practice of Chri&s;tianity, and to ob|&s;erve
the following Rules. To retire
<PB N="394" REF="415">
much from the Conver&s;ation of the
World. To &s;ink them&s;elves into an
entire Repo&s;e and Tranquillity of Mind.
In this State of Silence to attend the &s;e|cret
Illap&s;e and Flowings in of the Ho|ly
Spirit, that may fill their Minds with
Peace and Con&s;olation, Joys or Rap|tures.
To favour all his &s;ecret Intima|tions,
and give them&s;elves up entirely
to his Conduct and Direction, &s;o as
neither to &s;peak, move, or act, but as
they find his Impul&s;e on their Souls.
To retrench them&s;elves within the Con|veniencies
and Nece&s;&s;ities of Life. To
make a Covenant with all their Sen&s;es,
&s;o far as to &s;hun the Smell of a Ro&s;e or
Violet, and to turn away their Eyes from
a beautiful Pro&s;pect. To avoid, as much
as is po&s;&s;ible, what the World calls In|nocent
Plea&s;ures, le&s;t they &s;hould have
their Affections tainted by any Sen&s;uali|ty,
and diverted from the Love of him
who is to be the only Comfort, Repo&s;e,
Hope, and Delight, of their whole Beings.
This Sect prevails very much among the
Prote&s;tants of <HI>Germany,</HI> as well as tho&s;e
of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and has occa&s;ion'd &s;e|veral
Edicts again&s;t it in the Dutchy
of <HI>Saxony.</HI> The Profe&s;&s;ors of it are ac|cus'd
of all the ill Practices which may
&s;eem to be the Con&s;equence of their
<PB N="395" REF="416">
Principles, as that they a&s;cribe the wor&s;t
of Actions, which their own vicious
Tempers throw them upon, to the Di|ctates
of the Holy Spirit; that both
Sexes under Pretence of Devout Con|ver&s;ation
vi&s;it one another at all Hours,
and in all Places, without any regard to
common Decency, often making their
Religion a Cover for their Immorali|ties;
and that the very be&s;t of them are
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with Spiritual Pride, and a
Contempt for all &s;uch as are not of their
own Sect. The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who
reproach the Prote&s;tants for their break|ing
into &s;uch a Multitude of Religions,
have certainly taken the mo&s;t effectual
way in the World for the keeping their
Flocks together; I don't mean the Pu|ni&s;hments
they inflict on Mens Per&s;ons,
which are commonly look'd upon as the
chief Methods by which they deter them
from breaking through the Pale of the
Church, though certainly the&s;e lay a
very great Re&s;traint on tho&s;e of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Per&s;ua&s;ion. But I
take one great Cau&s;e why there are &s;o
few Sects in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to
be the Multitude of Convents, with which
they every where abound, that &s;erve as
Receptacles for all tho&s;e fiery Zealots
who would &s;et the Church in a Flame,
<PB N="396" REF="417">
were not they got together in the&s;e
Hou&s;es of Devotion. All Men of dark
Tempers, according to their Degree of
Melancholy or Enthu&s;ia&s;m, may find
Convents fitted to their Humours, and
meet with Companions as gloomy as
them&s;elves. So that what the Prote|&s;tants
would call a Fanatick, is in the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church a Religious of &s;uch or
&s;uch an Order; as I have been told of
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who af|ter
&s;ome great Di&s;appointments in the
World was re&s;olv'd to turn Quaker or
Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli|gion,
Men of ordinary Under&s;tandings
don't &s;o much con&s;ider the Principles,
as the Practice of tho&s;e to whom they
go over.</P>
<P>From St. <HI>Gaul</HI> I took Hor&s;e to the
Lake of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> which lyes at Two
Leagues Di&s;tance from it, and is form'd
by the Entry of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> This is the
only Lake in <HI>Europe</HI> that di&s;putes for
Greatne&s;s with that of <HI>Geneva</HI>; it ap|pears
more beautiful to the Eye, but
wants the fruitful Fields and Vineyards
that border upon the other. It receives
its Name from <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> the chief Town
on its Banks. When the Cantons of
<HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Zurich</HI> propo&s;ed, at a general
Diet, the Incorporating <HI>Geneva</HI> in the
<PB N="397" REF="418">
Number of the Cantons, the <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick Party, fearing the Prote&s;tant
Intere&s;t might receive by it too great a
Strengthning, propo&s;ed at the &s;ame time
the Incantoning of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> as a Coun|terpoi&s;e;
to which the Prote&s;tants not
con&s;enting, the whole Project fell to
the Ground. We cro&s;s'd the Lake to
<HI>Lindaw,</HI> and in &s;everal Parts of it ob|&s;erved
abundance of little Bubbles of
Air, that came working upward from
the very Bottom of the Lake. The
Watermen told us, that they are ob|&s;erved
always to ri&s;e in the &s;ame Places,
from whence they conclude them to be
&s;o many Springs that break out of the
Bottom of the Lake. <HI>Lindaw</HI> is an Im|perial
Town on a little I&s;land that lyes
at about Three Hundred Paces from the
firm Land, to which it is join'd by a
huge Bridge of Wood. The Inhabitants
were all in Arms when we pa&s;s'd through
it, being under great Apprehen&s;ions of
the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> after his having
fallen upon <HI>Ulm</HI> and <HI>Memminghen.</HI> They
flatter them&s;elves, that by cutting their
Bridge they could hold out again&s;t his
Army: But, in all Probability, a Shower
of Bombs would quickly reduce the
Burgeois to Surrender. They were for|merly
Bombarded by <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus.</HI>
<PB N="398" REF="419">
We were advis'd by our Merchants, by
no means to venture our &s;elves in the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Country, &s;o that we
had the Mortification to lo&s;e the Sight
of <HI>Munich, Ausburg,</HI> and <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> and
were forced to take our Way to <HI>Vienna</HI>
through the <HI>Tirol,</HI> where we had very
little to Entertain us be&s;ides the natural
Face of the Country.</P>

<HEAD>TIROL,
INSPRUCK,
HALL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER having coa&s;ted the
<HI>Alps</HI> for &s;ome time, we at la&s;t
entered them by a Pa&s;&s;age
which leads into the long
Valley of the <HI>Tirol,</HI> and fol|lowing
the Cour&s;e of the River <HI>Inn</HI> we
came to <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> that receives its Name
from this River, and is the Capital Ci|ty
of the <HI>Tirol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In&s;pruck</HI> is a hand&s;ome Town, though
not a great one, and was formerly the
Re&s;idence of the Arch-Dukes who were
Counts of <HI>Tirol</HI>: The Palace where they
u&s;ed to keep their Court is rather Con|venient
than Magnificent. The great
Hall is indeed a very noble Room, the
Walls of it are painted in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> and
<PB N="400" REF="421">
repre&s;ent the Labours of <HI>Hercules.</HI> Ma|ny
of them look very finely, though a
great part of the Work has been crack'd
by Earthquakes, which are very fre|quent
in this Country. There is a lit|tle
Wooden Palace that borders on the
other, whither the Court u&s;ed to retire
at the fir&s;t &s;hake of an Earthquake. I
&s;aw here the large&s;t Menage that I have
met with any where el&s;e. At one End
of it is a great Partition de&s;igned for an
Opera. They &s;howed us al&s;o a very
pretty Theatre. The la&s;t Comedy that
was acted on it was de&s;igned by the Je|&s;uits
for the Entertainment of the Queen
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who pa&s;s'd this way from
<HI>Hanover</HI> to <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Compliment
which the Fathers made her Maje&s;ty on
this occa&s;ion was very particular, and
did not a little expo&s;e them to the
Raillery of the Court. For the Arms of
<HI>Hanover</HI> being a Hor&s;e, the Fathers
thought it a very pretty Allu&s;ion to re|pre&s;ent
the Queen by <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> that
would let no Body get upon him but
<HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. The Wooden
Hor&s;e that acted this nobtale Part is &s;till
to be &s;een behind the Scenes. In one
of the Rooms of the Palace which is
hung with the Pictures of &s;everal Illu|&s;trious
Per&s;ons, they &s;howed us the Por|trait
<PB N="401" REF="422">
of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who
was beheaded in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The Gardens about
the Hou&s;e are very large, but ill kept.
There is in the middle of them a beau|tiful
Statue in Bra&s;s of an Arch-Duke
<HI>Leopold</HI> on Hor&s;eback. There are near
it Twelve other Figures of Water-Nymphs
and River-Gods well Ca&s;t, and
as big as the Life. They were de&s;igned
for the Ornaments of a Water-Work,
as one might ea&s;ily make a great Vari|ety
of Jetteaus at a &s;mall Expence in a
Garden that has the River <HI>Inn</HI> running
by its Walls. The late Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI>
had this Palace, and the Govern|ment
of the <HI>Tirol</HI> a&s;&s;igned him by the
Emperor, and his Lady the Queen Dow|ager
of <HI>Poland</HI> lived here &s;everal Years
after the Death of the Duke her Hu&s;|band.
There are covered Galleries that
lead from the Palace to Five different
Churches. I pa&s;&s;ed through a very long
one which reaches to the Church of the
<HI>Capucin</HI> Convent, where the Duke of
<HI>Lorrain</HI> u&s;ed often to a&s;&s;i&s;t at their Mid|night
Devotions. They &s;howed us in
this Convent the Apartments of <HI>Maxi|milian,</HI>
who was Arch-Duke and Count
of <HI>Tirol</HI> about Four&s;core Years ago. This
Prince at the &s;ame time that he kept the
<PB N="402" REF="423">
Government in his Hands, lived in this
Convent with all the Rigor and Au&s;te|rity
of a <HI>Capucin.</HI> His Anti-Chamber
and Room of Audience are little &s;quare
Chambers Wain&s;coated. His private
Lodgings are Three or Four &s;mall
Rooms faced with a kind of Fret-work,
that makes them look like little Hollow
Caverns in a Rock. They pre&s;erve this
Apartment of the Convent uninhabited,
and &s;how in it the Altar, Bed and Stove,
as likewi&s;e a Picture and a Stamp of this
Devout Prince. The Church of the
<HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Convent is famous for the Mo|nument
of the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the
Fir&s;t, which &s;tands in the mid&s;t of it. It
was erected to him by his Grand-Son
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Fir&s;t, who probably looked
upon this Emperor as the Founder of
the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Greatne&s;s. For as by his
own Marriage he annexed the Low-Countries
to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;o
by matching his Son to <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Arra|gon</HI>
he &s;ettled on his Po&s;terity the King|dom
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by the Marriage of
his Grand-Son <HI>Ferdinand</HI> got into his
Family the Kingdoms of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and
<HI>Hungary.</HI> This Monument is only Ho|norary,
for the A&s;hes of the Emperor
lye el&s;ewhere. On the Top of it is a
Brazen Figure of <HI>Maximilian</HI> on his
<PB N="403" REF="424">
Knees, and on the Sides of it a beau|tiful
<HI>Bas Relief</HI> repre&s;enting the Actions
of this Prince. His whole Hi&s;tory is
dige&s;ted into Twenty Four &s;quare Pan|nels
of Sculpture in <HI>Bas Relief</HI>: The
Subject of Two of them is his Confede|racy
with <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, and the
Wars they made together upon <HI>France.</HI>
On each Side of this Monument is a
Row of very noble Brazen Statues much
bigger than the Life, mo&s;t of them re|pre&s;enting
&s;uch as were &s;ome way or o|ther
related to <HI>Maximilian.</HI> Among the
re&s;t is one that the Fathers of the Con|vent
tell us repre&s;ents King <HI>Arthur</HI> the
old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King. But what Relation
had that <HI>Arthur</HI> to <HI>Maximilian</HI>? I don't
que&s;tion therefore but it was de|&s;igned
for Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> Elder Bro|ther
of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, who had e&s;|pou&s;ed
<HI>Catharine,</HI> Si&s;ter of <HI>Maximilian,</HI>
who&s;e Divorce afterwards gave occa&s;i|on
to &s;uch &s;ignal Revolutions in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
This Church was built by <HI>Ferdinand</HI>
the Fir&s;t. One &s;ees in it a kind of Offer at
Modern Architecture, but at the &s;ame
time that the Architect has &s;hown his
Di&s;like of the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner, one may
&s;ee very well that in that Age they were
not, at lea&s;t in this Country, arrived
at the Knowledge of the true Way.
<PB N="404" REF="425">
The Portal, for Example, con&s;i&s;ts of a
compo&s;ite Order unknown to the Anci|ents;
the Ornaments indeed are taken
from them, but &s;o put together that you
&s;ee the Volutes of the <HI>Ionic,</HI> the Foliage
of the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and the Uovali of the
<HI>Doric</HI> mix'd without any Regularity on
the &s;ame Capital. So the Vault of the
Church, tho' broad enough, is encum|ber'd
with too many little Tricks in
Sculpture. It is indeed &s;upported with
&s;ingle Columns in&s;tead of tho&s;e va&s;t
Clu&s;ters of little Pillars that one meets
with in <HI>Gothic</HI> Cathedrals, but at the
&s;ame time the&s;e Columns are of no regu|lar
Order, and at lea&s;t Twice too long
for their Diameter. There are other
Churches in the Town, and Two or
Three Palaces which are of a more Mo|dern
Make, and built with a good Fan|cy.
I was &s;hown the little <HI>Notredame</HI>
that is hand&s;omly de&s;ign'd, and topp'd
with a Cupola. It was made as an Of|fering
of Gratitude to the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin,
for having defended the Country
of the <HI>Tirol</HI> again&s;t the Victorious Arms
of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> who could not
enter this Part of the Empire after ha|ving
over-run mo&s;t of the re&s;t. This
Temple was therefore built by the Con|tributions
of the whole Country. At
<PB N="405" REF="426">
about half a League's di&s;tance from <HI>In|&s;pruck</HI>
&s;tands the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Amras,</HI> fur|ni&s;h'd
with a prodigious Quantity of
Medals, and many other &s;orts of Rari|ties
both in Nature and Art, for which
I mu&s;t refer the Reader to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa|tin</HI>'s
Account in his Letter to the Duke
of <HI>Wirtemburg,</HI> having my &s;elf had nei|ther
Time or Opportunity to enter into
a particular Examination of them.</P>
<P>From <HI>In&s;pruck</HI> we came to <HI>Hall,</HI> that
lyes at a League di&s;tance on the &s;ame
River. This Place is particularly fa|mous
for its Salt-Works. There are in
the Neighbourhood va&s;t Mountains of
a tran&s;parent kind of Rock not unlike
Allum, extreamly &s;olid, and as piquant
to the Tongue as Salt it &s;elf. Four or
Five Hundred Men are always at Work
in the&s;e Mountains, where as &s;oon as
they have hewn down any Quantities of
the Rock they let in their Springs and
Re&s;ervoirs among their Works. The
Water eats away and di&s;&s;olves the Par|ticles
of Salt which are mix'd in the
Stone, and is convey'd by long Troughs
and Canals from the Mines to the Town
of <HI>Hall,</HI> where 'tis received in va&s;t Ci|&s;terns,
and boil'd off from time to
time.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="427">
They make after the rate of Eight
Hundred Loaves a Week, each Loaf
Four Hundred Pound Weight. This
would rai&s;e a great Revenue to the Em|peror,
were there here &s;uch a Tax on
Salt as there is in <HI>France.</HI> At pre&s;ent he
clears but Two Hundred Thou&s;and
Crowns a Year, after having defray'd
all the Charges of working it. There
are in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and other Parts of
the <HI>Alps,</HI> &s;everal of the&s;e Quarries of
Salt that turn to very little Account, by
Rea&s;on of the great Quantities of Wood
they con&s;ume.</P>
<P>The Salt-Works at <HI>Hall</HI> have a great
Convenience for Fuel which &s;wims down
to them on the River <HI>Inn.</HI> This Ri|ver,
during its Cour&s;e through the <HI>Ti|rol,</HI>
is generally &s;hut up between a dou|ble
Range of Mountains that are mo&s;t
of them cover'd with Woods of Fir-Trees.
Abundance of Pea&s;ants are em|ploy'd
in the hewing down of the lar|ge&s;t
of the&s;e Trees, that, after they are
Bark'd and cut into Shape, are tumbled
down from the Mountains into the
Stream of the River, which carries them
off to the Salt-Works. At <HI>In&s;pruck</HI>
they take up va&s;t Quantities for the Con|vents
and publick Officers, who have a
certain Portion of it alloted them by the
<PB N="407" REF="428">
Emperor: the re&s;t of it pa&s;&s;es on to
<HI>Hall.</HI> There are generally &s;everal Hun|dred
Loads afloat, for they begin to cut
above Twenty Five Leagues up the Ri|ver
above <HI>Hall,</HI> and there are other Ri|vers
that flow into the <HI>Inn,</HI> which bring
in their Contributions. The&s;e Salt-Works,
and a Mint that is e&s;tabli&s;h'd at
the &s;ame Place, have render'd this Town,
notwith&s;tanding the Neighbourhood of
the Capital City, almo&s;t as populous as
<HI>In&s;pruck</HI> it &s;elf. The De&s;ign of this
Mint is to work off part of the Metals
which are found in the neighbouring
Mountains; where, as we were told,
there are Seven Thou&s;and Men in con|&s;tant
Employ. At <HI>Hall</HI> we took a Boat
to carry us to <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Fir&s;t Night
we lay at <HI>Rottenburg,</HI> where is a &s;trong
Ca&s;tle above the Town. Count <HI>Serini</HI>
is &s;till clo&s;e Pri&s;oner in this Ca&s;tle, who,
as they told us in the Town, had lo&s;t his
Sen&s;es by his long Impri&s;onment and Af|flictions.
The next Day we Din'd at
<HI>Kuff-&s;tain,</HI> where there is a Fortre&s;s on
a high Rock above the Town almo&s;t
inacce&s;&s;ible on all Sides: This being
a Frontier Place on the Dutchy of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> where we enter'd after about
an Hour's Rowing from <HI>Kuff-&s;tain.</HI> It
was the plea&s;ante&s;t Voyage in the World
<PB N="408" REF="429">
to follow the Windings of this River
<HI>Inn</HI> through &s;uch a Variety of plea&s;ing
Scenes as the Cour&s;e of it naturally led
us. We had &s;ometimes on each Side
us a va&s;t Extent of naked Rocks and
Mountains, broken into a Thou&s;and ir|regular
Steeps and Precipices; in other
Places we &s;aw a long Fore&s;t of Fir-Trees
&s;o thick &s;et together, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to di&s;cover any of the Soil they
grew upon, and ri&s;ing up &s;o regularly
one above another, as to give us the
View of a whole Wood at once. The
time of the Year, that had given the
Leaves of the Trees &s;o many different
Colours, compleated the Beauty of the
Pro&s;pect. But as the Materials of a fine
Landskip are not always the mo&s;t profi|table
to the Owner of them, we met
with but very little Corn or Pa&s;turage
for the Proportion of Earth that we
pa&s;s'd through, the Lands of the <HI>Tirol</HI>
not being able to feed the Inhabitants.
This long Valley of the <HI>Tirol</HI> lyes en|clo&s;ed
on all Sides by the <HI>Alps,</HI> tho'
its Dominions &s;hoot out into &s;everal
Branches that lye among the Breaks and
Hollows of the Mountains. It is go|vern'd
by Three Councils re&s;iding at
<HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> one &s;its upon Life and Death,
the other is for Taxes and Impo&s;itions,
<PB N="409" REF="430">
and a third for the common Di&s;tributi|ons
of Ju&s;tice. As the&s;e Courts regulate
them&s;elves by the Orders they receive
from the Imperial Court, &s;o in many
Ca&s;es there are Appeals from them to
<HI>Vienna.</HI> The Inhabitants of the <HI>Tirol</HI>
have many particular Privileges above
tho&s;e of the other Hereditary Countries
of the Emperor. For as they are natu|rally
well fortify'd among their Moun|tains,
and at the &s;ame time border upon
many different Governments, as the <HI>Gri|&s;ons,</HI>
<HI>Venetians, Swi&s;s, Bavarians,</HI> &amp;c.
a &s;evere Treatment might tempt them
to &s;et up for a Republick, or at lea&s;t
throw them&s;elves under the milder Go|vernment
of &s;ome of their Neighbours:
Be&s;ides that their Country is poor, and
that the Emperor draws con&s;iderable In|comes
out of its Mines of Salt and Me|tal.
They are the&s;e Mines that fill the
Country with greater Numbers of Peo|ple
than it would be able to bear
without the Importation of Corn from
Foreign Parts. The Emperor has Forts
and Cittadels at the Entrance of all the
Pa&s;&s;es that lead into the <HI>Tirol,</HI> which
are &s;o advantagiou&s;ly placed upon Rocks
and Mountains, that they command all
the Vallies and Avenues that lye about
them. Be&s;ides, that the Country it &s;elf
<PB N="410" REF="431">
is cut into &s;o many Hills and Inequali|ties,
as would render it defen&s;ible by a ve|ry
little Army again&s;t a numerous Enemy.
It was therefore generally thought the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> would not attempt
the cutting off any Succours that were
&s;ent to Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>; or the forcing
his Way through the <HI>Tirol</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI>
The River <HI>Inn,</HI> that had hitherto been
&s;hut up among Mountains, pa&s;&s;es gene|rally
through a wide open Country dur|ing
all its Cour&s;e through <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
which is a Voyage of Two Days, after
the rate of Twenty Leagues a Day.</P>
