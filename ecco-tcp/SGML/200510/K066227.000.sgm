TRUTH
OF THE
Scripture Hi&s;tory of St. Paul
EVINCED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>EXPOSITION OF THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE volume of Chri&s;tian &s;criptures
contains thirteen letters purporting
to be written by St. Paul; it contains al&s;o
a book, which among&s;t other things, pro|fe&s;&s;es
to deliver the hi&s;tory, or rather me|moirs
of the hi&s;tory, of this &s;ame per&s;on.
<PB N="2" REF="4">
By a&s;&s;uming the genuinene&s;s of the letters,
we may prove the &s;ub&s;tantial truth of the
hi&s;tory; or, by a&s;&s;uming the truth of the
hi&s;tory, we may argue &s;trongly in &s;upport
of the genuinene&s;s of the letters. But I a&s;|&s;ume
neither one nor the other. The rea|der
is at liberty to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e writings to
have been lately di&s;covered in the library
of the E&s;curial, and to come to our hands
de&s;titute of any extrin&s;ic or collateral evi|dence
whatever; and the argument I am
about to offer is calculated to &s;hew, that a
compari&s;on of the different writings would,
even under the&s;e circum&s;tances, afford good
rea&s;on to believe the per&s;ons and tran&s;ac|tions
to have been real, the letters authen|tic,
and the narration in the main to be
true.</P>
<P>Agreement or conformity between let|ters
bearing the name of an ancient author,
and a received hi&s;tory of that author's life,
does not nece&s;&s;arily e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of
either: becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. The hi&s;tory may, like Middleton's
Life of Cicero, or Jortin's Life of Era&s;mus,
have been wholly, or in part, compiled
<PB N="3" REF="5">
from the letters; in which ca&s;e it is ma|nife&s;t
that the hi&s;tory adds nothing to the
evidence already afforded by the letters:
or,</P>
<P N="2">2. The letters may have been fabricated
out of the hi&s;tory: a &s;pecies of impo&s;ture
which is certainly practicable; and which,
without any acce&s;&s;ion of proof or autho|rity,
would nece&s;&s;arily produce the appear|ance
of con&s;i&s;tency and agreement: or,</P>
<P N="3">3. The hi&s;tory and letters may have
been founded upon &s;ome authority com|mon
to both; as upon reports and tradi|tions
which prevailed in the age in which
they were compo&s;ed, or upon &s;ome ancient
record now lo&s;t, which both writers con|&s;ulted:
in which ca&s;e al&s;o, the letters, with|out
being genuine, may exhibit marks of
conformity with the hi&s;tory; and the hi&s;|tory,
without being true, may agree with
the letters.</P>
<P>Agreement therefore, or conformity, is
only to be relied upon &s;o far as we can ex|clude
the&s;e &s;everal &s;uppo&s;itions. Now the
point to be noticed is, that, in the three
ca&s;es above enumerated, conformity mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="6">
be the effect of <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> Where the hi&s;tory
is compiled from the letters, which is the
fir&s;t ca&s;e, the de&s;ign and compo&s;ition of
the work are in general &s;o confe&s;&s;ed, or
made &s;o evident by compari&s;on, as to leave
us in no danger of confounding the pro|duction
with original hi&s;tory, or of mi&s;|taking
it for an independent authority.
The agreement, it is probable, will be clo&s;e
and uniform, and will ea&s;ily be perceived
to re&s;ult from the intention of the author,
and from the plan and conduct of his work.&mdash;Where
the letters are fabricated from the
hi&s;tory, which is the &s;econd ca&s;e, it is al|ways
for the purpo&s;e of impo&s;ing a forgery
upon the public; and, in order to give co|lour
and probability to the fraud, names,
places, and circum&s;tances, found in the hi&s;|tory,
may be &s;tudiou&s;ly introduced into the
letters, as well as a general con&s;i&s;tency be
endeavoured to be maintained. But here
it is manife&s;t, that whatever congruity ap|pears,
is the con&s;equence of meditation,
artifice, and de&s;ign.&mdash;The third ca&s;e is
that wherein the hi&s;tory and the letters,
without any direct privity or communica|tion
<PB N="5" REF="7">
with each other, derive their materials
from the &s;ame &s;ource; and, by rea&s;on of
their common original, furni&s;h in&s;tances of
accordance and corre&s;pondency. This is a
&s;ituation in which we mu&s;t allow it to be
po&s;&s;ible for ancient writings to be placed;
and it is a &s;ituation in which it is more dif|ficult
to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;purious from genuine
writings, than in either of the ca&s;es de|&s;cribed
in the preceding &s;uppo&s;itions; in|a&s;much
as the congruities ob&s;ervable are &s;o
far accidental, as that they are not produced
by the immediate tran&s;planting of names and
circum&s;tances out of one writing into the
other. But although, with re&s;pect to each
other, the agreement in the&s;e writings be
mediate and &s;econdary, yet is it not pro|perly
or ab&s;olutely unde&s;igned; becau&s;e,
with re&s;pect to the common original from
which the information of the writers pro|ceeds,
it is &s;tudied and factitious. The
ca&s;e of which we treat mu&s;t, as to the
letters, be a ca&s;e of forgery; and when the
writer, who is per&s;onating another, &s;its
down to his compo&s;ition&mdash;whether he have
the hi&s;tory with which we now compare
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the letters, or &s;ome other record, before
him; or whether he have only loo&s;e tra|dition
and reports to go by&mdash;he mu&s;t adapt
his impo&s;ture, as well as he can, to what he
finds in the&s;e accounts; and his adaptations
will be the re&s;ult of council, &s;cheme, and
indu&s;try: art mu&s;t be employed; and ve&s;|tiges
will appear of management and de|&s;ign.
Add to this, that, in mo&s;t of the
following examples, the circum&s;tances in
which the coincidence is remarked are of
too particular and dome&s;tic a nature, to
have floated down upon the &s;tream of ge|neral
tradition.</P>
<P>Of the three ca&s;es which we have &s;tated,
the difference between the fir&s;t and the two
others is, that in the fir&s;t the de&s;ign may be
fair and hone&s;t, in the others it mu&s;t be ac|companied
with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of fraud:
but in all there is de&s;ign. In examining,
therefore, the agreement between ancient
writings, the character of truth and origi|nality
is unde&s;ignedne&s;s: and this te&s;t ap|plies
to every &s;uppo&s;ition; for, whether we
&s;uppo&s;e the hi&s;tory to be true, but the let|ters
&s;purious; or the letters to be genuine,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
but the hi&s;tory fal&s;e; or, la&s;tly, fal&s;ehood
to belong to both&mdash;the hi&s;tory to be a fa|ble,
and the letters fictitious; the &s;ame in|ference
will re&s;ult&mdash;that either there will be
no agreement between them, or the agree|ment
will be the effect of de&s;ign. Nor will
it elude the principle of this rule, to &s;up|po&s;e
the &s;ame per&s;on to have been the au|thor
of all the letters, or even the author
both of the letters and the hi&s;tory; for no
le&s;s de&s;ign is nece&s;&s;ary to produce coinci|dence
between different parts of a man's
own writings, e&s;pecially when they are
made to take the different forms of a hi&s;|tory
and of original letters, than to adju&s;t
them to the circum&s;tances found in any
other writing.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to tho&s;e writings of the New
Te&s;tament which are to be the &s;ubject of
our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, I think that, as
to the authenticity of the epi&s;tles, this ar|gument,
where it is &s;ufficiently &s;u&s;tained by
in&s;tances, is nearly conclu&s;ive; for I cannot
a&s;&s;ign a &s;uppo&s;ition of forgery, in which
coincidences of the kind we enquire after
are likely to appear. As to the hi&s;tory,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
it extends to the&s;e points:&mdash;It proves the
general reality of the circum&s;tances; it
proves the hi&s;torian's knowledge of the&s;e
circum&s;tances. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance it
confirms his preten&s;ions of having been a
cotemporary, and in the latter part of his
hi&s;tory a companion of St. Paul. In a
word, it e&s;tabli&s;hes the &s;ub&s;tantial truth
of the narration: and <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> truth is
that which, in every hi&s;torical enquiry,
ought to be the fir&s;t thing &s;ought after
and a&s;certained; it mu&s;t be the ground
work of every other ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The reader then will plea&s;e to remem|ber
this word <HI>unde&s;ignedne&s;s,</HI> as denoting
that upon which the con&s;truction and va|lidity
of our argument chiefly depend.</P>
<P>As to the proofs of unde&s;ignedne&s;s, I
&s;hall in this place &s;ay little; for I had
rather the reader's per&s;ua&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e
from the in&s;tances them&s;elves, and the &s;e|parate
remarks with which they may be
accompanied, than from any previous for|mulary
or de&s;cription of argument. In a
great plurality of examples, I tru&s;t he will
be perfectly convinced that no de&s;ign or
<PB N="9" REF="11">
contrivance whatever has been exerci&s;ed:
and if &s;ome of the coincidences alledged
appear to be minute, circuitous, or ob|lique,
let him reflect that this very indi|rectne&s;s
and &s;ubtility is that which gives
force and propriety to the example. Broad,
obvious, and explicit agreements prove
little; becau&s;e it may be &s;ugge&s;ted that the
in&s;ertion of &s;uch is the ordinary expedient
of every forgery: and though they may
occur, and probably will occur, in genuine
writings, yet it cannot be proved that they
are peculiar to the&s;e. Thus what St.
Paul declares in chap. xi. of 1 Cor. con|cerning
the in&s;titution of the euchari&s;t&mdash;"For
I have received of the Lord that
which I al&s;o delivered unto you, that
the Lord Je&s;us, the &s;ame night in which
he was betrayed, took bread; and when
he had given thanks, he brake it, and
&s;aid, Take, eat; this is my body, which
is broken for you; this do in remem|brance
of me"&mdash;though it be in clo&s;e
and verbal conformity with the account of
the &s;ame tran&s;action pre&s;erved by St. Luke,
is yet a conformity of which no u&s;e can be
<PB N="10" REF="12">
made in our argument; for if it &s;hould be
objected that this was a mere recital from
the go&s;pel, borrowed by the author of the
epi&s;tle, for the purpo&s;e of &s;etting off his
compo&s;ition by an appearance of agree|ment
with the received account of the
Lord's &s;upper, I &s;hould not know how to
repel the in&s;inuation. In like manner, the
de&s;cription which St. Paul gives of him&s;elf,
in his epi&s;tle to the Philippians (iii. 5)&mdash;"Circumci&s;ed
the eighth day, of the &s;tock
of I&s;rael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an
Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching
the law, a Phari&s;ee; concerning zeal,
per&s;ecuting the church; touching the
righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law, blame|le&s;s"&mdash;is
made up of particulars &s;o plainly
delivered concerning him, in the Acts of
the Apo&s;tles, the Epi&s;tle to the Romans,
and the Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, that I
cannot deny but that it would be ea&s;y for
an impo&s;tor, who was fabricating a letter
in the name of St. Paul, to collect the&s;e
articles into one view. This, therefore, is
a conformity which we do not adduce.
But when I read, in the Acts of the Apo|&s;tles,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
that "when Paul came to Derbe and
Ly&s;tra, behold a certain di&s;ciple was
there, named Timotheus, the &s;on of a
certain woman <HI>which was a Jewe&s;s</HI>;"
and when, in an epi&s;tle addre&s;&s;ed to Ti|mothy,
I find him reminded of his "having
known the holy &s;criptures <HI>from a child,</HI>"
which implies that he mu&s;t, on one &s;ide or
both, have been brought up by Jewi&s;h pa|rents;
I conceive that I remark a coinci|dence
which &s;hews, by its very <HI>obliquity,</HI>
that &s;cheme was not employed in its forma|tion.
In like manner, if a coincidence de|pend
upon a compari&s;on of dates, or rather
of circum&s;tances from which the dates are ga|thered&mdash;the
more intricate that compari&s;on
&s;hall be; the more numerous the interme|diate
&s;teps through which the conclu&s;ion is
deduced; in a word, the more <HI>circuitous</HI>
the inve&s;tigation is, the better, becau&s;e the
agreement which finally re&s;ults is thereby
farther removed from the &s;u&s;picion of con|trivance,
affectation, or de&s;ign. And it
&s;hould be remembered, concerning the&s;e co|incidences,
that it is one thing to be mi|nute,
and another to be precarious; one
<PB N="12" REF="14">
thing to be unob&s;erved, and another to be
ob&s;cure; one thing to be circuitous or
oblique, and another to be forced, dubious,
or fanciful. And this di&s;tinction ought
always to be retained in our thoughts.</P>
<P>The very particularity of St. Paul's epi&s;|tles;
the perpetual recurrence of names of
per&s;ons and places; the frequent allu&s;ions to
the incidents of his private life, and the cir|cum&s;tances
of his condition and hi&s;tory; and
the connection and paralleli&s;m of tho&s;e with
the &s;ame circum&s;tances in the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles, &s;o as to enable us, for the mo&s;t
part, to confront them with one another;
as well as the relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between
the circum&s;tances, as mentioned or referred
to in the different epi&s;tles&mdash;afford no incon|&s;iderable
proof of the genuinene&s;s of the
writings, and the reality of the tran&s;actions.
For as no advertency is &s;ufficient to guard
again&s;t &s;lips and contradictions, when cir|cum&s;tances
are multiplied, and when they
are liable to be detected by cotemporary ac|counts
equally circum&s;tantial, an impo&s;tor,
I &s;hould expect, would either have avoided
particulars entirely, contenting him&s;elf with
<PB N="13" REF="15">
doctrinal di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, moral precepts, and
general reflections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, mu&s;t not be mi&s;under&s;tood. A per&s;on writing to his friends, and upon a &s;ubject in which the tran&s;actions of his own life were concerned, would probably be led in the cour&s;e of his letter, e&s;pe|cially if it was a long one, to refer to pa&s;&s;ages found in his hi&s;tory. A per&s;on addre&s;&s;ing an epi&s;tle to the public at large, or under the form of an epi&s;tle delivering a di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ome &s;peculative argument, would not, it is probable, meet with an occa&s;ion of alluding to the circum&s;tances of his life at all: he might, or he might not; the chance on either &s;ide is nearly equal. This is the &s;ituation of the catholic epi&s;tle. Although, there|fore, the pre&s;ence of the&s;e allu&s;ions and agreements be a valuable acce&s;&s;ion to the arguments by which the au|thenticity of a letter is maintained, yet the want of them certainly forms no po&s;itive objection.</NOTE>; or if, for the &s;ake of
imitating St. Paul's &s;tyle, he &s;hould have
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inter&s;per&s;e his com|po&s;ition
with names and circum&s;tances, he
would have placed them out of the reach of
compari&s;on with the hi&s;tory. And I am
confirmed in this opinion by an in&s;pection
of two attempts to counterfeit St. Paul's
epi&s;tles, which have come down to us; and
the only attempts, of which we have any
knowledge, that are at all de&s;erving of re|gard.
<PB N="14" REF="16">
One of the&s;e is an epi&s;tle to the
Laodiceans, extant in Latin, and pre&s;erved
by Fabricius in his collection of apocryphal
&s;criptures. The other purports to be an
epi&s;tle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, in
an&s;wer to an epi&s;tle from the Corinthians
to him. This was tran&s;lated by Scroderus
from a copy in the Armenian language
which had been &s;ent to W. Whi&s;ton, and
was afterwards, from a more perfect copy
procured at Aleppo, publi&s;hed by his &s;ons,
as an appendix to their edition of Mo&s;es
Chorenen&s;is. No Greek copy exi&s;ts of
either: they are not only not &s;upported by
ancient te&s;timony, but they are negatived
and excluded; as they have never found
admi&s;&s;ion into any catalogue of apo&s;tolical
writings, acknowledged by, or known to,
the early ages of Chri&s;tianity. In the fir&s;t
of the&s;e I found, as I expected, a total
<HI>evitation</HI> of circum&s;tances. It is &s;imply a
collection of &s;entences from the canonical
epi&s;tles, &s;trung together with very little
&s;kill. The &s;econd, which is a more ver&s;ute
and &s;pecious forgery, is introduced with a
li&s;t of names of per&s;ons who wrote to St.
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Paul from Corinth; and is preceded by an
account &s;ufficiently particular of the man|ner
in which the epi&s;tle was &s;ent from Co|rinth
to St. Paul, and the an&s;wer returned.
But they are names which no one ever
heard of; and the account it is impo&s;&s;ible
to combine with any thing found in the
Acts, or in the other epi&s;tles. It is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for me to point out the internal
marks of &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s and impo&s;ture which
the&s;e compo&s;itions betray; but it was nece&s;|&s;ary
to ob&s;erve, that they do not afford
tho&s;e coincidences which we propo&s;e as
proofs of authenticity in the epi&s;tles which
we defend.</P>
<P>Having explained the general &s;cheme and
formation of the argument, I may be per|mitted
to &s;ubjoin a brief account of the
manner of conducting it.</P>
<P>I have di&s;po&s;ed the &s;everal in&s;tances of
agreement under &s;eparate numbers; as well
to mark more &s;en&s;ibly the divi&s;ions of the
&s;ubject, as for another purpo&s;e, viz. that the
reader may thereby be reminded that the
in&s;tances are independent of one another.
I have advanced nothing which I did not
<PB N="16" REF="18">
think probable; but the degree of probabi|lity,
by which different in&s;tances are &s;up|ported,
is undoubtedly very different. If
the reader, therefore, meets with a number
which contains an in&s;tance that appears to
him un&s;atisfactory, or founded in mi&s;take,
he will di&s;mi&s;s that number from the argu|ment,
but without prejudice to any other.
He will have occa&s;ion al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that
the coincidences di&s;coverable in &s;ome epi&s;tles
are much fewer and weaker than what
are &s;upplied by others. But he will add to his
ob&s;ervation this important circum&s;tance&mdash;that
whatever a&s;certains the original of one
epi&s;tle, in &s;ome mea&s;ure e&s;tabli&s;hes the au|thority
of the re&s;t. For, whether the&s;e epi&s;|tles
be genuine or &s;purious, every thing
about them indicates that they come from
the &s;ame hand. The diction, which it is
extremely difficult to imitate, pre&s;erves its
re&s;emblance and peculiarity throughout all
the epi&s;tles. Numerous expre&s;&s;ions and
&s;ingularities of &s;tyle, found in no other part
of the New Te&s;tament, are repeated in dif|ferent
epi&s;tles; and occur, in their re&s;pective
places, without the &s;malle&s;t appearance of
<PB N="17" REF="19">
force or art. An involved argumentation,
frequent ob&s;curities, e&s;pecially in the order
and tran&s;ition of thought, piety, vehe|mence,
affection, bur&s;ts of rapture, and of
unparalleled &s;ublimity, are properties, all
or mo&s;t of them, di&s;cernible in every letter
of the collection. But although the&s;e epi&s;|tles
bear &s;trong marks of proceeding from
the &s;ame hand, I think it is &s;till more cer|tain
that they were originally &s;eparate pub|lications.
They form no continued &s;tory;
they compo&s;e no regular corre&s;pondence;
they compri&s;e not the tran&s;actions of any
particular period; they carry on no connec|tion
of argument; they depend not upon
one another; except in one or two in|&s;tances,
they refer not to one another. I
will farther undertake to &s;ay, that no &s;tudy
or care has been employed to produce or pre|&s;erve
an appearance of con&s;i&s;tency among&s;t
them. All which ob&s;ervations &s;hew that
they were not intended by the per&s;on, who|ever
he was, that wrote them, to come
forth or be read together; that they ap|peared
at fir&s;t &s;eparately, and have been
collected &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
The proper purpo&s;e of the following
work is, to bring together, from the Acts
of the Apo&s;tles, and from the different epi&s;|tles,
&s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as furni&s;h examples of
unde&s;igned coincidence; but I have &s;o far
enlarged upon this plan, as to take into it
&s;ome circum&s;tances found in the epi&s;tles,
which contributed &s;trength to the con|clu&s;ion,
though not &s;trictly objects of com|pari&s;on.</P>
<P>It appeared al&s;o a part of the &s;ame plan,
to examine the difficulties which pre&s;ented
them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of our enquiry.</P>
<P>I do not know that the &s;ubject has been
propo&s;ed or con&s;idered in this view before.
Ludovicus Capellus, Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, Dr.
Ben&s;on, and Dr. Lardner, have each given
a continued hi&s;tory of St. Paul's life, made
up from the Acts of the Apo&s;tles and the
epi&s;tles joined together. But this, it is
manife&s;t, is a different undertaking from
the pre&s;ent, and directed to a different
purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall produce from
this epi&s;tle, and upon which a good
deal of ob&s;ervation will be founded, is the
following:</P>
<P>"But now I go unto Jeru&s;alem, to mi|ni&s;ter
unto the &s;aints; for it hath plea&s;ed
them of Macedonia and Achaia to make
a certain contribution for the poor &s;aints
which are at Jeru&s;alem." Rom. xv. 25,
26.</P>
<P>In this quotation three di&s;tinct circum|&s;tances
are &s;tated&mdash;a contribution in Ma|cedonia
for the relief of the Chri&s;tians of
Jeru&s;alem, a contribution in Achaia for the
&s;ame purpo&s;e, and an intended journey of
St. Paul to Jeru&s;alem. The&s;e circum|&s;tances
are &s;tated as taking place at the &s;ame
time, and that to be the time when the
epi&s;tle was written. Now let us enquire
whether we can find the&s;e circum&s;tances
<PB N="21" REF="23">
el&s;ewhere; and whether, if we do find
them, they meet together in re&s;pect of date.
Turn to the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, chap. xx.
ver. 2, 3, and you read the following ac|count:
"When he had gone over tho&s;e
parts (viz. Macedonia), and had given
them much exhortation, he came into
Greece, and there abode three months;
and when the Jews laid wait for him, <HI>as
he was about to &s;ail into Syria,</HI> he pur|po&s;ed
to return through Macedonia."
From this pa&s;&s;age, compared with the ac|count
of St. Paul's travels given before,
and from the &s;equel of the chapter, it ap|pears,
that upon St. Paul's <HI>&s;econd</HI> vi&s;it to the
penin&s;ula of Greece, his intention was, when
he &s;hould leave the country, to proceed
from Achaia directly by &s;ea to Syria; but
that, to avoid the Jews, who were lying in
wait to intercept him in his route, he &s;o far
changed his purpo&s;e as to go back through
Macedonia, embark at Philippi, and pur&s;ue
his voyage from thence towards Jeru&s;alem.
Here therefore is a journey to Jeru&s;alem;
but not a &s;yllable of any contribution. And
as St. Paul had taken &s;everal journeys to
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Jeru&s;alem before, and one al&s;o immediately
after his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> vi&s;it into the penin&s;ula of
Greece (Acts xviii. 21.), it cannot from
hence be collected in which of the&s;e vi&s;its
the epi&s;tle was written, or, with certainty,
that it was written in either. The &s;ilence
of the hi&s;torian, who profe&s;&s;es to have been
with St. Paul at the time (v. 6.), concerning
any contribution, might lead us to look out
for &s;ome different journey, or might induce
us perhaps to que&s;tion the con&s;i&s;tency of
the two records, did not a very accidental
reference, in another part of the &s;ame hi&s;|tory,
afford us &s;ufficient ground to believe
that this &s;ilence was omi&s;&s;ion. When St.
Paul made his reply before Felix, to the
accu&s;ations of Tertullus, he alledged, as
was natural, that neither the errand which
brought him to Jeru&s;alem, nor his conduct
whil&s;t he remained there, merited the ca|lumnies
with which the Jews had a&s;per&s;ed
him. "Now after many years (i. e. of
ab&s;ence) <HI>I came to bring alms to my nation
and offerings</HI>; whereupon certain Jews from
A&s;ia found me purified in the temple, nei|ther
with multitude nor with tumult, who
<PB N="23" REF="25">
ought to have been here before thee, and
object, if they had ought again&s;t me."
Acts xxiv. 17-19. This mention of alms
and offerings certainly brings the narrative
in the Acts nearer to an accordancy with
the epi&s;tle; yet no one, I am per&s;uaded,
will &s;u&s;pect that this clau&s;e was put into St.
Paul's defence, either to &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ion
in the preceding narrative, or with any view
to &s;uch accordancy.</P>
<P>After all, nothing is yet &s;aid or hinted
concerning the <HI>place</HI> of the contribution;
nothing concerning Macedonia and Achaia.
Turn therefore to the Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians, chap. xvi. ver. 1-4, and you
have St. Paul delivering the following di|rections:
"Concerning the collection for
the &s;aints, as I have given orders to the
churches of Galatia, even &s;o do ye: upon
the fir&s;t day of the week let every one
of you lay by him in &s;tore as God hath
pro&s;pered him, that there be no gather|ings
when I come. And when I come,
whom&s;oever you &s;hall approve by your
letters, them will I &s;end to bring your
liberality unto Jeru&s;alem; and if it be
<PB N="24" REF="26">
meet that I go al&s;o, they &s;hall go with
me." In this pa&s;&s;age we find a contri|bution
carrying on at Corinth, the capital of
Achaia, for the Chri&s;tians of Jeru&s;alem; we
find al&s;o a hint given of the po&s;&s;ibility of
St. Paul's going up to Jeru&s;alem him&s;elf,
after he had paid his vi&s;it into Achaia:
but this is &s;poken of rather as a po&s;&s;ibility
than as any &s;ettled intention; for his fir&s;t
thought was, "Whom&s;oever you &s;hall ap|prove
by your letters, them will I <HI>&s;end</HI> to
bring your liberality to Jeru&s;alem:" and,
in the &s;ixth ver&s;e, he adds, "That ye may
bring me on my journey <HI>whither&s;oever</HI> I
go." This epi&s;tle purports to be written
after St. Paul had been at Corinth; for it
refers throughout to what he had done and
&s;aid among&s;t them whil&s;t he was there. The
expre&s;&s;ion therefore, "When I come,"
mu&s;t relate to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> vi&s;it; again&s;t which
vi&s;it the contribution &s;poken of was de&s;ired
to be in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>But though the contribution in Achaia
be expre&s;sly mentioned, nothing is here
&s;aid concerning any contribution in Mace|donia.
Turn therefore, in the third place,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to the Second Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians,
chap. viii. ver. 1-4, and you will di&s;cover
the particular which remains to be &s;ought
for: "Moreover, brethren, we do you to
wit of the grace of God be&s;towed on the
<HI>churches of Macedonia</HI>; how that, in a great
trial of affliction, the abundance of their
joy and their deep poverty abounded unto
the riches of their liberality; for to their
power I bear record, yea, and beyond
their power, they were willing of them|&s;elves;
praying us, with much entreaty,
that we would receive the gift, and take
upon us the fellow&s;hip of the mini&s;tering
to the &s;aints." To which add chap. ix.
ver. 2: "I know the forwardne&s;s of your
mind, for which I boa&s;t of you to them
of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a
year ago." In this epi&s;tle we find St.
Paul advanced as far as Macedonia, upon
that <HI>&s;econd</HI> vi&s;it to Corinth which he pro|mi&s;ed
in his former epi&s;tle; we find al&s;o,
in the pa&s;&s;ages now quoted from it, that a
contribution was going on in Macedonia at
the &s;ame time with, or &s;oon however fol|lowing,
the contribution which was made
<PB N="26" REF="28">
in Achaia; but for whom the contribution
was made does not appear in this epi&s;tle at
all: that information mu&s;t be &s;upplied from
the fir&s;t epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>Here therefore, at length, but fetched
from three different writings, we have ob|tained
the &s;everal circum&s;tances we en|quired
after, and which the Epi&s;tle to the
Romans brings together, viz. a contribu|tion
in Achaia for the Chri&s;tians of Jeru|&s;alem;
a contribution in Macedonia for
the &s;ame; and an approaching journey of
St. Paul to Jeru&s;alem. We have the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances&mdash;each
by &s;ome hint in the pa&s;|&s;age
in which it is mentioned, or by the
date of the writing in which the pa&s;&s;age
occurs&mdash;fixed to a particular time; and we
have that time turning out, upon examina|tion,
to be in all the <HI>&s;ame</HI>; namely, to|wards
the clo&s;e of St. Paul's &s;econd vi&s;it
to the penin&s;ula of Greece. This is an
in&s;tance of conformity beyond the po&s;|&s;ibility,
I will venture to &s;ay, of ran|dom
writing to produce. I al&s;o a&s;&s;ert,
that it is in the highe&s;t degree improbable
that it &s;hould have been the effect of con|trivance
<PB N="27" REF="29">
and de&s;ign. The imputation of
<HI>de&s;ign</HI> amounts to this, that the forger of
the Epi&s;tle to the Romans in&s;erted in it
the pa&s;&s;age upon which our ob&s;ervations
are founded, for the purpo&s;e of giving co|lour
to his forgery by the appearance of
conformity with other writings which were
then extant. I reply, in the fir&s;t place, that,
if he did this to countenance his forgery,
he did it for the purpo&s;e of an argument
which would not &s;trike one reader in ten
thou&s;and. Coincidences &s;o circuitous as
this an&s;wer not the ends of forgery; are
&s;eldom, I believe, attempted by it. In the
&s;econd place I ob&s;erve, that he mu&s;t have
had the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and the two
Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians, before him at
the time. In the Acts of the Apo&s;tles (I
mean that part of the Acts which relates to
this period) he would have found the jour|ney
to Jeru&s;alem; but nothing about the
contribution. In the Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians he would have found a con|tribution
going on in Achaia for the Chri&s;|tians
of Jeru&s;alem, and a di&s;tant hint of the
po&s;&s;ibility of the journey; but nothing con|cerning
<PB N="28" REF="30">
a contribution in Macedonia. In
the Second Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians he
would have found a contribution in Mace|donia
accompanying that in Achaia; but
no intimation for whom either was intend|ed,
and not a word about the journey. It
was only by a clo&s;e and attentive collation
of the three writings, that he could have
picked out the circum&s;tances which he has
united in his epi&s;tle; and by a &s;till more
nice examination, that he could have deter|mined
them to belong to the &s;ame period.
In the third place I remark, what dimi|ni&s;hes
very much the &s;u&s;picion of fraud,
how aptly and connectedly the mention
of the circum&s;tances in que&s;tion, viz. the
journey to Jeru&s;alem, and of the occa&s;ion
of that journey, ari&s;es from the context.
"When&s;oever I take my journey into Spain,
I will come to you; for I tru&s;t to &s;ee you
in my journey, and to be brought on my
way thitherward by you, if fir&s;t I be
&s;omewhat filled with your company.
<HI>But now I go unto Jeru&s;alem, to mini&s;ter
unto the &s;aints; for it hath plea&s;ed them of
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain</HI> <PB N="29" REF="31">
<HI>contribution for the poor &s;aints which are at
Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It hath plea&s;ed them verily,
and their debtors they are; for if the
Gentiles have been made partakers of
their &s;piritual things, their duty is al&s;o
to mini&s;ter unto them in carnal things.
When therefore I have performed this,
and have &s;ealed to them this fruit, I will
come by you into Spain." Is the pa&s;&s;age
in <HI>Italics</HI> like a pa&s;&s;age foi&s;ted in for an ex|traneous
purpo&s;e? Does it not ari&s;e from
what goes before, by a junction as ea&s;y as
any example of writing upon real bu&s;ine&s;s
can furni&s;h? Could any thing be more na|tural
than that St. Paul, in writing to the
Romans, &s;hould &s;peak of the time when he
hoped to vi&s;it them; &s;hould mention the
bu&s;ine&s;s which then detained him; and
that he purpo&s;ed to &s;et forwards upon
his journey to them, when that bu&s;ine&s;s
was completed?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>By means of the quotation which form|ed
the &s;ubject of the preceding number, we
collect, that the Epi&s;tle to the Romans was
<PB N="30" REF="32">
written at the conclu&s;ion of St. Paul's &s;e|cond
vi&s;it to the penin&s;ula of Greece: but
this we collect, not from the epi&s;tle it&s;elf,
not from any thing <HI>declared</HI> concerning the
time and place in any part of the epi&s;tle,
but from a compari&s;on of circum&s;tances
referred to in the epi&s;tle, with the order of
events recorded in the Acts, and with re|ferences
to the &s;ame circum&s;tances, though
for quite different purpo&s;es, in the two
Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians. Now would
the author of a forgery, who &s;ought to gain
credit to a &s;purious letter by congruities,
depending upon the time and place in
which the letter was &s;uppo&s;ed to be writ|ten,
have left that time and place to be
made out, in a manner &s;o ob&s;cure and in|direct
as this is? If therefore coincidences
of circum&s;tances can be pointed out in
this epi&s;tle, depending upon its date, or
the place where it was written, whil&s;t that
date and place are only a&s;certained by other
circum&s;tances, &s;uch coincidences may fairly
be &s;tated as <HI>unde&s;igned.</HI> Under this head I
adduce</P>
<P>Chap. xvi. 21-23. "Timotheus, my
<PB N="31" REF="33">
workfellow, and Lucius, and Ja&s;on, and
So&s;ipater, my kin&s;men, &s;alute you. I Ter|tius,
who wrote this epi&s;tle, &s;alute you in
the Lord. Gaius mine ho&s;t, and of the
whole church, &s;aluteth you; and Quartus,
a brother." With this pa&s;&s;age I compare
Acts xx. 4. "And there accompanied
him into A&s;ia, Sopater of Berea; and, of
the The&s;&s;alonians, Ari&s;tarchus and Secun|dus;
and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus;
and, of A&s;ia, Tychicus, and Trophimus."
The Epi&s;tle to the Romans, we have &s;een, was
written ju&s;t before St. Paul's departure from
Greece, after his &s;econd vi&s;it to that penin|&s;ula:
the per&s;ons mentioned in the quotation
from the Acts are tho&s;e who accompanied
him in that very departure. Of &s;even who&s;e
names are joined in the &s;alutation of the
church of Rome, three, viz. So&s;ipater,
Gaius, and Timothy, are proved, by this
pa&s;&s;age in the Acts, to have been with St.
Paul at the time. And this is perhaps as
much coincidence as could be expected from
reality, though le&s;s, I am apt to think, than
would have been produced by de&s;ign. Four
are mentioned in the Acts who are not joined
<PB N="32" REF="34">
in the &s;alutation; and it is in the nature of
the ca&s;e probable that there &s;hould be many
attending St. Paul in Greece who knew no|thing
of the converts at Rome, nor were
known by them. In like manner &s;everal are
joined in the &s;alutation who are not men|tioned
in the pa&s;&s;age referred to in the Acts.
This al&s;o was to be expected. The occa&s;ion
of mentioning them in the Acts was their
proceeding with St. Paul upon his journey.
But we may be &s;ure that there were many
eminent Chri&s;tians with St. Paul in Greece,
be&s;ides tho&s;e who accompanied him into
A&s;ia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e Ja&s;on is one, who&s;e pre&s;ence upon this occa&s;ion is very naturally accounted for. Ja&s;on was an inhabitant of The&s;&s;alonica in Macedonia, and enter|tained St. Paul in his hou&s;e upon his fir&s;t vi&s;it to that country. Acts xvii. 7.&mdash;St. Paul, upon this his &s;econd vi&s;it, pa&s;&s;ed through Macedonia on his way to Greece, and, from the &s;ituation of The&s;&s;alonica, mo&s;t likely thro' that city. It appears, from various in&s;tances in the Acts, to have been the practice of many converts to attend St. Paul from place to place. It is therefore highly probable, I mean that it is highly con&s;i&s;tent with the account in the hi&s;tory, that Ja&s;on, according to that ac|count a zealous di&s;ciple, the inhabitant of a city at no great di&s;tance from Greece, and through which, as it &s;hould &s;eem, St. Paul had lately pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould have ac|companied St. Paul into Greece, and have been with him there at this time. Lucius is another name in the epi&s;tle. A very &s;light alteration would convert <GAP DESC="foreign"> into <GAP DESC="foreign">, Lucius into Luke, which would produce an ad|ditional coincidence: for, if Luke was the author of the hi&s;tory, he was with St. Paul at this time; ina&s;much as, de&s;cribing the voyage which took place &s;oon after the writing of this epi&s;tle, the hi&s;torian u&s;es the fir&s;t per&s;on&mdash;"<HI>We</HI> &s;ailed away from Philippi. Acts, xx. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
But if any one &s;hall &s;till contend that a
forger of the epi&s;tle, with the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles before him, and having &s;ettled his
&s;cheme of writing a letter as from St. Paul
upon his &s;econd vi&s;it into Greece, would
ca&s;ily think of the expedient of putting
in the names of tho&s;e per&s;ons who appeared
to be with St. Paul at the time, as an ob|vious
recommendation of the impo&s;ture;
I then repeat my ob&s;ervations: fir&s;t, that he
would have made the catalogue more com|plete;
and &s;econdly, that with this contriv|ance
in his thoughts, it was certainly his
bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to avail him&s;elf of the arti|fice,
to have &s;tated in the body of the epi&s;tle
that St. Paul was in Greece when he wrote
it, and that he was there upon his &s;econd
<PB N="34" REF="36">
vi&s;it. Neither of which he has done, either
directly, or even &s;o as to be di&s;coverable by
any circum&s;tance found in the narrative de|livered
in the Acts.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame head, viz. of coincidences
depending upon date, I cite from the epi&s;tle
the following &s;alutation: "Greet Pri&s;cilla and
Aquila, my helpers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who
have for my life laid down their own necks;
unto whom not only I give thanks, but
al&s;o all the churches of the Gentiles."
Chap. xvi. 3.&mdash;It appears, from the Acts of
the Apo&s;tles, that Pri&s;cilla and Aquila had
originally been inhabitants of Rome; for
we read, Acts xviii. 2, that "Paul found a cer|tain
Jew, named Aquila, lately come from
Italy with his wife Pri&s;cilla, becau&s;e that
Claudius had commanded all Jews to de|part
from <HI>Rome.</HI>" They were connected
therefore with the place to which the &s;aluta|tions
are &s;ent. That is one coincidence; ano|ther
is the following: St. Paul became ac|quainted
with the&s;e per&s;ons at Corinth during
his fir&s;t vi&s;it into Greece. They accompanied
him upon his return into A&s;ia; were &s;ettled
for &s;ome time at Ephe&s;us, Acts xviii. 19-26;
<PB N="35" REF="37">
and appear to have been with St. Paul when
he wrote from that place his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. xvi. 19. Not
long after the writing of which epi&s;tle St.
Paul went from Ephe&s;us into Macedonia,
and "after he had gone over tho&s;e parts"
proceeded from thence upon his &s;econd vi&s;it
into Greece; during which vi&s;it, or rather
at the conclu&s;ion of it, the Epi&s;tle to the
Romans, as hath been &s;hewn, was written.
We have therefore the time of St. Paul's re|&s;idence
at Ephe&s;us after he had written to the
Corinthians, the time taken up by his progre&s;s
through Macedonia (which is indefinite, and
was probably con&s;iderable), and his three
months abode in Greece; we have the &s;um
of the&s;e three periods allowed for Aquila and
Pri&s;cilla going back to Rome, &s;o as to be
there when the epi&s;tle before us was written.
Now what this quotation leads us to ob&s;erve
is, the danger of &s;cattering names and circum|&s;tances
in writings like the pre&s;ent, how
implicated they often are with dates and
places, and that nothing but truth can pre|&s;erve
con&s;i&s;tency. Had the notes of time in
the Epi&s;tle to the Romans fixed the writing
<PB N="36" REF="38">
of it to any date prior to St. Paul's fir&s;t re&s;i|dence
at Corinth, the &s;alutation of Aquila
and Pri&s;cilla would have contradicted the
hi&s;tory, becau&s;e it would have been prior to
his acquaintance with the&s;e per&s;ons. If the
notes of time had fixed it to any period
during <HI>that</HI> re&s;idence at Corinth, during his
journey to Jeru&s;alem when he fir&s;t returned
out of Greece, during his &s;tay at Antioch
whither he went down from Jeru&s;alem, or
during his &s;econd progre&s;s through the Le&s;&s;er
A&s;ia upon which he proceeded from Antioch,
an equal contradiction would have been in|curred;
becau&s;e from Acts xviii. 2-18, 19-
26, it appears that during all this time Aquila
and Pri&s;cilla were either along with St. Paul,
or were abiding at Ephe&s;us. La&s;tly, had the
notes of time in this epi&s;tle, which we have
&s;een to be perfectly incidental, compared
with the notes of time in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, which are equally in|cidental,
fixed this epi&s;tle to be either
cotemporary with that, or prior to it, a
&s;imilar contradiction would have en&s;ued;
becau&s;e, fir&s;t, when the Epi&s;tle to the Corin|thians
was written, Aquila and Pri&s;cilla were
<PB N="37" REF="39">
along with St. Paul, as they joined in the &s;a|lutation
of that church, 1 Cor. xvi. 19; and
becau&s;e, &s;econdly, the hi&s;tory does not allow
us to &s;uppo&s;e, that between the time of their
becoming acquainted with St. Paul, and the
time of St. Paul's writing to the Corin|thians,
Aquila and Pri&s;cilla could have gone
to Rome, &s;o as to have been &s;aluted in an
epi&s;tle to that city; and then come back to St.
Paul at Ephe&s;us, &s;o as to be joined with him
in &s;aluting the church of Corinth. As it is,
all things are con&s;i&s;tent. The Epi&s;tle to the
Romans is po&s;terior even to the &s;econd
Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians; becau&s;e it &s;peaks
of a contribution in Achaia being completed,
which the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians
chap. viii. is only &s;oliciting. It is &s;ufficiently
therefore po&s;terior to the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians, to allow time in the interval for
Aquila and Pri&s;cilla's return from Ephe&s;us
to Rome.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e two per&s;ons, we
may take notice of the terms of commenda|tion
in which St. Paul de&s;cribes them, and
of the agreement of that encomium with
the hi&s;tory. "My helpers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
who have for my life laid down their
necks; unto whom not only I give thanks,
but al&s;o all the churches of the Gentiles."
In the eighteenth chapter of the Acts, we
are informed that Aquila and Pri&s;cilla were
Jews; that St. Paul fir&s;t met with them at
Corinth; that for &s;ome time he abode in
the &s;ame hou&s;e with them; that St. Paul's
contention at Corinth was with the unbe|lieving
Jews, who at fir&s;t "oppo&s;ed and
bla&s;phemed, and afterwards with one ac|cord
rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection again&s;t him;"
that Aquila and Pri&s;cilla adhered, we may
conclude, to St. Paul throughout this whole
conte&s;t; for, when he left the city, they
went with him, Acts xiii. 18. Under the&s;e
circum&s;tances, it is highly probable that they
&s;hould be involved in the dangers and per|&s;ecutions
which St. Paul underwent from
the Jews, being them&s;elves Jews; and, by
adhering to St. Paul in this di&s;pute, de&s;erters,
as they would be accounted, of the Jewi&s;h
cau&s;e. Farther, as they, though Jews, were
a&s;&s;i&s;ting to St. Paul in preaching to the Gen|tiles
at Corinth, they had taken a decided
part in the great controver&s;y of that day,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the admi&s;&s;ion of the Gentiles to a parity of
religious &s;ituation with the Jews. For this
conduct alone, if there was no other rea&s;on,
they may &s;eem to have been entitled to
"thanks from the churches of the Gentiles."
They were Jews taking part with Gen|tiles.
Yet is all this &s;o indirectly intimated,
or rather &s;o much of it left to inference in
the account given in the Acts, that I do not
think it probable that a forger either could
or would have drawn his repre&s;entation from
thence; and &s;till le&s;s probable do I think it,
that, without having &s;een the Acts, he could
by mere accident, and without truth for his
guide, have delivered a repre&s;entation &s;o
conformable to the circum&s;tances there re|corded.</P>
<P>The two congruities la&s;t adduced depended
upon the time, the two following regard the
place, of the epi&s;tle.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chap. xvi. 23. "Era&s;tus, the chamber|lain
of the city, &s;aluteth you"&mdash;of what
city? We have &s;een, that is, we have infer|red
from circum&s;tances found in the epi&s;tle,
compared with circum&s;tances found in the
Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and in the two Epi&s;tles
<PB N="40" REF="42">
to the Corinthians, that our epi&s;tle was
written during St. Paul's &s;econd vi&s;it to the
penin&s;ula of Greece. Again, as St. Paul,
in his epi&s;tle to the church of Corinth,
1 Cor. xvi. 3, &s;peaks of a collection going
on in that city, and of his de&s;ire that it
might be ready again&s;t he came thither;
and as in this epi&s;tle he &s;peaks of that col|lection
being ready, it follows that the
epi&s;tle was written either whil&s;t he was at
Corinth, or after he had been there. Thirdly,
&s;ince St. Paul &s;peaks in this epi&s;tle of his
journey to Jeru&s;alem, as about in&s;tantly to
take place; and as we learn, Acts xx. 3, that
his de&s;ign and attempt was to &s;ail upon that
journey immediately from Greece, properly
&s;o called, <HI>i. e.</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from Mace|donia;
it is probable that he was in this
country when he wrote the epi&s;tle, in which
he &s;peaks of him&s;elf as upon the eve of &s;et|ting
out. If in Greece, he was mo&s;t likely
at Corinth; for the two Epi&s;tles to the Co|rinthians
&s;hew that the principal end of his
coming into Greece was to vi&s;it that city,
where he had founded a church. Certainly
we know no place in Greece in which his
<PB N="41" REF="43">
pre&s;ence was &s;o probable: at lea&s;t, the
placing of him at Corinth &s;atisfies every
circum&s;tance. Now that Era&s;tus was an
inhabitant of Corinth, or had &s;ome connec|tion
with Corinth, is rendered a fair &s;ubject
of pre&s;umption, by that which is accident|ally
&s;aid of him in the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to
Timothy, chap. iii. v. 20, "Era&s;tus abode at
<HI>Corinth.</HI>" St. Paul complains of his &s;oli|tude,
and is telling Timothy what was
become of his companions: "Era&s;tus abode
at Corinth; but Trophimus have I left at
Miletum, &s;ick." Era&s;tus was one of tho&s;e
who had attended St. Paul in his travels,
Acts xix. 22; and when tho&s;e travels had,
upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, brought our apo&s;tle
and his train to Corinth, Era&s;tus &s;taid there,
for no rea&s;on &s;o probable as that it was his
home. I allow that this coincidence is not
&s;o preci&s;e as &s;ome others, yet I think it too
clear to be produced by accident; for, of
the many places which this &s;ame epi&s;tle has
a&s;&s;igned to different per&s;ons, and the innu|merable
others which it might have men|tioned,
how came it to fix upon Corinth for
Era&s;tus? And, as far as it is a coincidence,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
it is certainly unde&s;igned on the part of the
author of the Epi&s;tle to the Romans: be|cau&s;e
he has not told us of what city Era&s;tus
was the chamberlain; or, which is the &s;ame
thing, from what city the epi&s;tle was writ|ten,
the &s;etting forth of which was ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;play of the co|incidence,
if any &s;uch di&s;play had been
thought of: nor could the author of the
Epi&s;tle to Timothy leave Era&s;tus at Corinth,
from any thing he might have read in the
Epi&s;tle to the Romans, becau&s;e Corinth is
no where in that Epi&s;tle mentioned either
by name or de&s;cription.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chap. xvi. 1-3. "I commend unto you
Phoebe, our &s;i&s;ter, which is a &s;ervant of
the church which is at Cenchrea, that ye
receive her in the Lord, as becometh
&s;aints, and that ye a&s;&s;i&s;t her in what&s;o|ever
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he hath need of you; for
&s;he hath been a &s;uccourer of many, and
of my&s;elf al&s;o." Cenchrea adjoined to
Corinth; St. Paul therefore, at the time of
writing the letter, was in the neighbourhood
of the woman whom he thus recommends.
But, farther, that St. Paul had before this
<PB N="43" REF="45">
been at Cenchrea it&s;elf, appears from the
eighteenth chapter of the Acts; and appears
by a circum&s;tance as incidental, and as un|like
de&s;ign, as any that can be imagined.
"Paul after this tarried there (viz. at Co|rinth)
yet a good while, and then took
his leave of the brethren, and &s;ailed thence
into Syria, and with him Pri&s;cilla and
Aquila, having &s;horn his head <HI>in Cenchrea,</HI>
for he had a vow." xviii. 18. The &s;hav|ing
of the head denoted the expiration of
the Nazaritic vow. The hi&s;torian therefore,
by the mention of this circum&s;tance, vir|tually
tells us that St. Paul's vow was ex|pired
before he &s;et forward upon his voyage,
having deferred probably his departure un|til
he &s;hould be relea&s;ed from the re&s;trictions
under which his vow laid him. Shall we
&s;ay that the author of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles
feigned this anecdote of St. Paul at Cenchrea,
becau&s;e he had read in the Epi&s;tle to the
Romans that "Phoebe, a &s;ervant of the
church of Cenchrea, had been a &s;uccourer
of many, and of him al&s;o?" or &s;hall we
&s;ay that the author of the Epi&s;tle to the
Romans, out of his own imagination, created
<PB N="44" REF="46">
Phoebe "<HI>a &s;ervant of the church at Cenchrea,</HI>"
becau&s;e he read in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles
that Paul had "&s;horn his head" in that
place?</P>

<P>Let it be ob&s;erved that our epi&s;tle pur|ports
to have been written at the conclu&s;ion
of St. Paul's &s;econd journey into Greece;
that the quotation from the Acts contains
words &s;aid to have been &s;poken by St.
Paul at Ephe&s;us, &s;ome time before he &s;et
forwards upon that journey. Now I con|tend
that it is impo&s;&s;ible that two indepen|dent
fictions &s;hould have attributed to St.
Paul the &s;ame purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially a purpo&s;e
&s;o &s;pecific and particular as this, which was
not merely a general de&s;ign of vi&s;iting
Rome, but a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Rome after he
had pa&s;&s;ed through Macedonia and Achaia,
and after he had performed a voyage from
the&s;e countries to Jeru&s;alem. The confor|mity
between the hi&s;tory and the epi&s;tle is
perfect. In the fir&s;t quotation from the
epi&s;tle, we find that a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting
Rome had long dwelt in the apo&s;tle's
mind: in the quotation from the Acts we
find that de&s;ign expre&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable
time before the epi&s;tle was written. In the
<PB N="46" REF="48">
hi&s;tory we find that the plan which St.
Paul had formed, was to pa&s;s through Mace|donia
and Achaia; after that, to go to Jeru|&s;alem;
and, when he had fini&s;hed his vi&s;it
there, to &s;ail for Rome. When the epi&s;tle
was written, he had executed &s;o much of
his plan, as to have pa&s;&s;ed through Mace|donia
and Achaia; and was preparing to
pur&s;ue the remainder of it, by &s;peedily
&s;etting out towards Jeru&s;alem: and in this
point of his travels he tells his friends at
Rome, that, when he had completed the
bu&s;ine&s;s which carried him to Jeru&s;alem, he
would come to them. Secondly, I &s;ay
that the very in&s;pection of the pa&s;&s;ages will
&s;atisfy us that they were not made up from
one another.</P>
<P>"When&s;oever I take my journey into

<P>The following quotation I offer for the
purpo&s;e of pointing out a geographical co|incidence,
of &s;o much importance, that Dr.
Lardner con&s;idered it as a confirmation of
the whole hi&s;tory of St. Paul's travels.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
Chap. xv. ver. 19. "So that from Jeru|&s;alem,
and round about unto Illyricum, I
have fully preached the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>I do not think that the&s;e words nece&s;&s;a|rily
import that St. Paul had penetrated into
Illyricum, or preached the go&s;pel in that
province; but rather that he had come to
the confines of Illyricum (<GAP DESC="foreign">),
and that the&s;e confines were the external
boundary of his travels. St. Paul con&s;iders
Jeru&s;alem as the centre, and is here viewing
the circumference to which his travels had
extended. The form of expre&s;&s;ion in the
original conveys this idea&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">.
Illyricum was the
part of this circle which he mentions in an
Epi&s;tle to the Romans, becau&s;e it lay in a
direction from Jeru&s;alem towards that city,
and pointed out to the Roman readers the
neare&s;t place to them, to which his travels
from Jeru&s;alem had brought him. The
name of Illyricum no where occurs in the
Acts of the Apo&s;tles; no &s;u&s;picion, there|fore,
can be conceived that the mention of
it was borrowed from thence. Yet I think it
appears, from the&s;e &s;ame Acts, that St. Paul,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
before the time when he wrote his Epi&s;tle to
the Romans, had reached the confines of
Illyricum; or, however, that he might have
done &s;o, in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with the ac|count
there delivered. Illyricum adjoins
upon Macedonia; mea&s;uring from Jeru&s;alem
towards Rome, it lies clo&s;e behind it. If,
therefore, St. Paul traver&s;ed the whole coun|try
of Macedonia, the route would nece&s;&s;ari|ly
bring him to the confines of Illyricum,
and the&s;e confines would be de&s;cribed as the
extremity of his journey. Now the account
of St. Paul's &s;econd vi&s;it to the penin&s;ula of
Greece, is contained in the&s;e words: "He
departed for to go into Macedonia; <HI>and
when he had gone over the&s;e parts,</HI> and had
given them much exhortation, he came
into Greece." Acts xx. 2. This account
allows, or rather leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that
St. Paul, in going over Macedonia (<GAP DESC="foreign">),
had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o far to the we&s;t, as
to come into tho&s;e parts of the country which
were contiguous to Illyricum, if he did
not enter into Illyricum it&s;elf. The hi&s;tory,
therefore, and the epi&s;tle &s;o far agree, and
the agreement is much &s;trengthened by a
<PB N="50" REF="52">
coincidence of <HI>time.</HI> At the time the epi&s;tle
was written, St. Paul might &s;ay, in confor|mity
with the hi&s;tory, that he had "come
into Illyricum:" much before that time,
he could not have &s;aid &s;o; for, upon his
former journey to Macedonia, his route is
laid down from the time of his landing at
Philippi to his &s;ailing from Corinth. We
trace him from Philippi to Amphipolis and
Appollonia; from thence to The&s;&s;alonica;
from The&s;&s;alonica to Beraea; from Beraea
to Athens; and from Athens to Corinth:
which track confines him to the ea&s;tern &s;ide
of the penin&s;ula, and therefore keeps him
all the while at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from
Illyricum. Upon his &s;econd vi&s;it to Mace|donia,
the hi&s;tory, we have &s;een, leaves him
at liberty. It mu&s;t have been, therefore,
upon that &s;econd vi&s;it, if at all, that he ap|proached
Illyricum; and this vi&s;it, we know,
almo&s;t immediately preceded the writing
of the epi&s;tle. It was natural that the
apo&s;tle &s;hould refer to a journey which was
fre&s;h in his thoughts.</P>

&s;trive together with me in your prayers
to God for me, that I may be delivered

this compare Acts xx. 22, 23:</P>
<P>"And now, behold, I go bound in the
Spirit unto Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the
things that &s;hall befal me there, &s;ave that
the Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every city,
&s;aying that bonds and afflictions abide
me."</P>
<P>Let it be remarked that it is the &s;ame
journey to Jeru&s;alem which is &s;poken of in
the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages; that the epi&s;tle was
written immediately before St. Paul &s;et for|wards
upon this journey from Achaia; that
the words in the Acts were uttered by him
when he had proceeded in that journey as
far as Miletus, in Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia. This being
remembered, I ob&s;erve that the two pa&s;&s;ages,
without any re&s;emblance between them
that could induce us to &s;u&s;pect that they
<PB N="52" REF="54">
were borrowed from one another, repre&s;ent
the &s;tate of St. Paul's mind, with re&s;pect to
the event of the journey, in terms of &s;ub|&s;tantial
agreement. They both expre&s;s his
&s;en&s;e of danger in the approaching vi&s;it to
Jeru&s;alem; they both expre&s;s the doubt
which dwelt upon his thoughts concerning
what might there befal him. When, in his
epi&s;tle, he entreats the Roman Chri&s;tians,
"for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and for
the love of the Spirit, to &s;trive together
with him in their prayers to God for him,
that he might be delivered from them
which do not believe in Judaea," he &s;uffi|ciently
confe&s;&s;es his fears. In the Acts of
the Apo&s;tles we &s;ee in him the &s;ame appre|hen&s;ions,
and the &s;ame uncertainty: "I go
bound in the Spirit to Jeru&s;alem, <HI>not
knowing</HI> the things that &s;hall befal me
there." The only difference is, that in
the hi&s;tory his thoughts are more inclined
to de&s;pondency than in the epi&s;tle. In
the epi&s;tle, he retains his hope "that he
&s;hould come unto them with joy by the
will of God;" in the hi&s;tory, his mind
yields to the reflection, "that the Holy
<PB N="53" REF="55">
Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every city that bonds
and afflictions awaited him." Now that
his fears &s;hould be greater, and his hopes
le&s;s, in this &s;tage of his journey than when
he wrote his epi&s;tle, that is, when he fir&s;t
&s;et out upon it, is no other alteration than
might well be expected; &s;ince tho&s;e pro|phetic
intimations to which he refers, when
he &s;ays, "the Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in
every city," had probably been received
by him in the cour&s;e of his journey, and
were probably &s;imilar to what we know
he received in the remaining part of it at
Tyre (xxi. 4), and afterwards from Aga|bus
at Cae&s;area (xxi. 11).</P>

<P>I de&s;ire the reader to call to mind that
part of St. Paul's hi&s;tory which took place
after his arrival at Jeru&s;alem, and which
employs the &s;even la&s;t chapters of the Acts;
and I build upon it this ob&s;ervation&mdash;that
&s;uppo&s;ing the Epi&s;tle to the Romans to
have been a forgery, and the author of the
forgery to have had the Acts of the Apo&s;tles
before him, and to have there &s;een that St.
Paul, in fact, "was <HI>not</HI> delivered from the
unbelieving Jews," but, on the contrary,
that he was taken into cu&s;tody at Jeru&s;a|lem,
and brought to Rome a pri&s;oner&mdash;it is
next to impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have made
St. Paul expre&s;s expectations &s;o contrary to
what he &s;aw had been the event; and utter
prayers, with apparent hopes of &s;ucce&s;s,
which he mu&s;t have known were fru&s;trated
in the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle con&s;ideration convinces me,
that no concert or con&s;ederacy whatever
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the epi&s;tle and the Acts
<PB N="55" REF="57">
of the Apo&s;tles; and that whatever coin|cidences
have been or can be pointed out
between them, are un&s;ophi&s;ticated, and are
the re&s;ult of truth and reality.</P>
<P>It al&s;o convinces me that the epi&s;tle was
written not only in St. Paul's life time, but
before he arrived at Jeru&s;alem; for the
important events relating to him which took
place after his arrival at that city, mu&s;t have
been known to the Chri&s;tian community
&s;oon after they happened: they form the
mo&s;t public part of his hi&s;tory. But had
they been known to the author of the
epi&s;tle&mdash;in other words, had they then taken
place&mdash;the pa&s;&s;age which we have quoted

<P>I now proceed to &s;tate the conformity
which exi&s;ts between the argument of this
epi&s;tle and the hi&s;tory of its reputed au|thor.
It is enough for this purpo&s;e to
ob&s;erve, that the object of the epi&s;tle, that
is, of the argumentative part of it, was to
place the Gentile convert upon a parity of
&s;ituation with the Jewi&s;h, in re&s;pect of his
<PB N="56" REF="58">
religious condition, and his rank in the divine
favour. The epi&s;tle &s;upports this point by
a variety of arguments; &s;uch as, "that no
man of either de&s;cription was ju&s;tified
by the works of the law&mdash;for this plain
rea&s;on, that no man had performed them;
that it became therefore nece&s;&s;ary to ap|point
another medium or condition of
ju&s;tification, in which new medium the
Jewi&s;h peculiarity was merged and lo&s;t;
that Abraham's own ju&s;tification was an|terior
to the law, and independent of it;
that the Jewi&s;h converts were to con&s;ider
the law as now dead, and them&s;elves as
married to another; that what the law
in truth could not do, in that it was weak
through the fle&s;h, God had done by &s;end|ing
his son; that God had rejected the
unbelieving Jews, and had &s;ub&s;tituted in
their place a &s;ociety of believers in Chri&s;t,
collected indifferently from Jews and Gen|tiles."
Soon after the writing of this epi|&s;tle,
St. Paul, agreeably to the intention inti|mated
in the epi&s;tle it&s;elf, took his journey
to Jeru&s;alem. The day after he arrived
there, he was introduced to the church.
<PB N="57" REF="59">
What pa&s;&s;ed at this interview is thus related,
Acts xxi. 19: "When he had &s;aluted them,
he declared particularly what things God
had wrought among the Gentiles by
his mini&s;try: and, when they heard it,
they glorified the Lord; and &s;aid unto
him, Thou &s;ee&s;t, brother, how many
thou&s;ands of Jews there are which believe;
and they are all zealous of the law; and
they <HI>are informed of thee,</HI> that thou teache&s;t
all the Jews which are among the Gen|tiles
to for&s;ake Mo&s;es, &s;aying, that they
ought not to circumci&s;e their children,
neither to walk after the cu&s;toms." St.
Paul di&s;claimed the charge; but there mu&s;t
have been &s;omething to have led to it.
Now it is only to &s;uppo&s;e that St. Paul
openly profe&s;&s;ed the principles which the
epi&s;tle contains; that, in the cour&s;e of his
mini&s;try, he had uttered the &s;entiments
which he is here made to write; and the
matter is accounted for. Concerning the
accu&s;ation which public rumour had brought
again&s;t him to Jeru&s;alem, I will not &s;ay that
it was ju&s;t; but I will &s;ay that, if he was
the author of the epi&s;tle before us, and if
<PB N="58" REF="60">
his preaching was con&s;i&s;tent with his writ|ing,
it was extremely natural; for, though
it be not a nece&s;&s;ary, &s;urely it is an ea&s;y
inference, that if the Gentile convert, who
did not ob&s;erve the law of Mo&s;es, held as
advantageous a &s;ituation in his religious
intere&s;ts as the Jewi&s;h convert who did,
there could be no &s;trong rea&s;on for ob&s;erving
that law at all. The remon&s;trance therefore
of the church of Jeru&s;alem, and the report
which occa&s;ioned it, were founded in no
very violent mi&s;con&s;truction of the apo&s;tle's
doctrine. His reception at Jeru&s;alem was
exactly what I &s;hould have expected the
author of this epi&s;tle to have met with. I
am entitled therefore to argue that a &s;eparate
narrative of effects experienced by St. Paul,
&s;imilar to what a per&s;on might be expected
to experience, who held the doctrines ad|vanced
in this epi&s;tle, forms a proof that
he did hold the&s;e doctrines; and that the
epi&s;tle bearing his name, in which &s;uch doc|trines
are laid down, actually proceeded
from him.</P>

<P>This number is &s;upplemental to the for|mer.
I propo&s;e to point out in it two par|ticulars
in the conduct of the argument, per|fectly
adapted to the hi&s;torical circum&s;tances
under which the epi&s;tle was written; which
yet are free from all appearance of contri|vance,
and which it would not I think have
entered into the mind of a &s;ophi&s;t to con|trive.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Epi&s;tle to the Galatians relates to the
&s;ame general que&s;tion as the Epi&s;tle to the
Romans. St. Paul had founded the church
of Galatia; at Rome he had never been. Ob|&s;erve
now a difference in his manner of treat|ing
of the &s;ame &s;ubject, corre&s;ponding with
this difference in his &s;ituation. In the Epi&s;tle
to the Galatians he puts the point in a great
mea&s;ure upon <HI>authority</HI>: "I marvel that ye
are &s;o &s;oon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Chri&s;t, unto another
go&s;pel." Gal. i. 6. "I certify you, bre|thren,
that the go&s;pel which was preached
of me, is not after man; for I neither re|ceived
it of man, neither was I taught it but
<PB N="60" REF="62">
by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t" (ch. i.
ver. 11, 12). "I am afraid le&s;t I have be&s;towed
upon you labour in vain" (iv. 11, 12).
"I de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent with you now, for
I &s;tand in doubt of you" (iv. 20). "Behold I,
Paul, &s;ay unto you, that, if ye be circumci|&s;ed,
Chri&s;t &s;hall profit you nothing" (ch. v. 2).
This per&s;ua&s;ion cometh not of him that call|ed
you" (ch. v. 8). This is the &s;tyle in which
he acco&s;ts the Galatians. In the epi&s;tle to the
converts of Rome, where his authority was
not e&s;tabli&s;hed, nor his per&s;on known, he
puts the &s;ame point entirely upon <HI>argument.</HI>
The peru&s;al of the epi&s;tle will prove this to
the &s;atisfaction of every reader; and, as the
ob&s;ervation relates to the whole contents of
the epi&s;tle, I forbear adducing &s;eparate ex|tracts.
I repeat therefore that we have pointed
out a di&s;tinction in the two epi&s;tles, &s;uited to
the relation in which the author &s;tood to his
different corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>Another adaptation, and &s;omewhat of the
&s;ame kind, is the following:</P>
<P N="2">2. The Jews we know were very nume|rous
at Rome, and probably formed a princi|pal
part among&s;t the new converts; &s;o much
<PB N="61" REF="63">
&s;o, that the Chri&s;tians &s;eem to have been
known at Rome rather as a denomination
of Jews, than as any thing el&s;e. In an epi&s;tle
con&s;equently to the Roman believers, the
point to be endeavoured after by St. Paul was,
to reconcile the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> converts to the opinion,
that the Gentiles were admitted by God to a
parity of religious &s;ituation with them&s;elves,
and that without their being bound by the law
of Mo&s;es. The Gentile converts would pro|bably
accede to this opinion very readily. In
this epi&s;tle, therefore, though directed to the
Roman church in general, it is in truth a Jew
writing to Jews. Accordingly you will take
notice, that as often as his argument leads him
to &s;ay any thing derogatory from the Jewi&s;h
in&s;titution, he con&s;tantly follows it by a &s;oft|ening
clau&s;e. Having (ii. 28, 29) pro|nounced,
not much perhaps to the &s;atisfaction
of the native Jews, "that he is not a Jew
which is one outwardly, neither that cir|cumci&s;ion
which is outward in the fle&s;h,"
he adds immediately "what advantage then
hath the Jew, or what profit is there in cir|cumci&s;ion?
<HI>much every way.</HI>" Having in the
<PB N="62" REF="64">
third chapter, ver. 28, brought his argument
to this formal conclu&s;ion, "that a man is ju&s;|tified
by faith, without the deeds of the
law," he pre&s;ently &s;ubjoins, ver. 31, "do we
then make void the law through faith? God
forbid; <HI>yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the law.</HI>" In the &s;e|venth
chapter, when in the &s;ixth ver&s;e he had
advanced the bold a&s;&s;ertion, that "now we
are delivered from the law, that being dead
wherein we were held;" in the very next
ver&s;e he comes in with this healing que&s;tion,
"What &s;hall we &s;ay then? Is the law &s;in? God
forbid; nay, I had not known &s;in but by
the law." Having in the following words
in&s;inuated, or rather more than in&s;inuated, the
inefficacy of the Jewi&s;h law, viii. 3, "for what
the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son
in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, and for &s;in,
condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h;" after a di|gre&s;&s;ion
indeed, but that &s;ort of a digre&s;&s;ion
which he could never re&s;i&s;t, a rapturous con|templation
of his Chri&s;tian hope, and which
occupies the latter part of this chapter; we
find him in the next, as if &s;en&s;ible that he
<PB N="63" REF="65">
had &s;aid &s;omething which would give offence,
returning to his Jewi&s;h brethren in terms of
the warme&s;t affection and re&s;pect. "I &s;ay
the truth in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; I lie not; my
con&s;cience al&s;o bearing me witne&s;s, in the
Holy Gho&s;t, that I have great heavine&s;s
and continual &s;orrow in my heart; for I
could wi&s;h that my&s;elf were accur&s;ed from
Chri&s;t, <HI>for my brethren, my kin&s;men ac|cording
to the fle&s;h, who are I&s;raelites, to
whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory,
and the covenants, and the giving of the law,
and the &s;ervice of God, and the promi&s;es;
who&s;e are the fathers; and of whom, as con|cerning
the fle&s;h, Chri&s;t came.</HI>" When, in
the thirty-fir&s;t and thirty-&s;econd ver&s;es
of this ninth chapter, he repre&s;ented to the
Jews the error of even the be&s;t of their
nation, by telling them that "I&s;rael, which
followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s,
had not attained to the law of righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith,
but as it were by the works of the law,
for they &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling-&s;tone,"
he takes care to annex to his declaration
<PB N="64" REF="66">
the&s;e conciliating expre&s;&s;ions: "Brethren,
<HI>my heart's de&s;ire and prayer to God for I&s;rael</HI>
is, that they might be &s;aved; for I bear
them record that they <HI>have a zeal of God,</HI>
but not according to knowledge." La&s;tly,
having, ch. x. ver. 20, 21, by the applica|tion
of a pa&s;&s;age in I&s;aiah in&s;inuated the
mo&s;t ungrateful of all propo&s;itions to a
Jewi&s;h ear, the rejection of the Jewi&s;h
nation, as God's peculiar people; he
ha&s;tens, as it were, to qualify the intelli|gence
of their fall by this intere&s;ting expo&s;|tulation:
"I &s;ay, then, hath God ca&s;t away
his people (i. e. wholly and entirely)?
<HI>God forbid</HI>; for I al&s;o am an I&s;raelite, of
the &s;eed of Abraham, of the tribe of Ben|jamin.
<HI>God hath not ca&s;t away his people
which he foreknew</HI>:" and follows this
thought, throughout the whole of the
eleventh chapter, in a &s;eries of reflections
calculated to &s;oothe the Jewi&s;h converts, as
well as to procure from their Gentile
brethren re&s;pect to the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution.
Now all this is perfectly natural. In a real
St. Paul writing to real converts, it is what
<PB N="65" REF="67">
anxiety to bring them over to his per&s;ua&s;ion
would naturally produce; but there is an
earne&s;tne&s;s and a per&s;onality, if I may &s;o call
it, in the manner, which a cold forgery,
I apprehend, would neither have conceived
nor &s;upported.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to compare this
epi&s;tle with the hi&s;tory, or with any
other epi&s;tle, we will employ one number
in &s;tating certain remarks applicable to
our argument, which ari&s;e from a per&s;ual
of the epi&s;tle it&s;elf.</P>
<P>By an expre&s;&s;ion in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the
&s;eventh chapter, "now concerning the things
whereof ye wrote unto me," it appears, that
this letter to the Corinthians was writ|ten
by St. Paul in an&s;wer to one which
he had received from them; and that the
&s;eventh, and &s;ome of the following chapters,
are taken up in re&s;olving certain doubts, and
regulating certain points of order, concern|ing
which the Corinthians had in their letter
con&s;ulted him. This alone is a circum|&s;tance
con&s;iderably in favour of the authen|ticity
<PB N="67" REF="69">
of the epi&s;tle: for it mu&s;t have been
a far-fetched contrivance in a forgery, fir&s;t
to have feigned the receipt of a letter from
the church of Corinth, which letter does not
appear; and then to have drawn up a ficti|tious
an&s;wer to it, relative to a great variety
of doubts and enquiries, purely oeconomi|cal
and dome&s;tic; and which, though like|ly
enough to have occurred to an infant
&s;ociety, in a &s;ituation and under an in&s;ti|tution
&s;o novel as that of a Chri&s;tian church
then was, it mu&s;t have very much exerci&s;ed
the author's invention, and could have an|&s;wered
no imaginable purpo&s;e of forgery, to
introduce the mention of at all. Particulars
of the kind we refer to, are &s;uch as the fol|lowing:
the rule of duty and prudence re|lative
to entering into marriage, as applicable
to virgins, to widows; the ca&s;e of hu&s;bands
married to unconverted wives, of wives having
unconverted hu&s;bands; that ca&s;e where the
unconverted party choo&s;es to &s;eparate, where
he choo&s;es to continue the union; the effect
which their conver&s;ion produced upon their
prior &s;tate, of circumci&s;ion, of &s;lavery; the
eating of things offered to idols, as it was in
<PB N="68" REF="70">
it&s;elf, as others were affected by it; the joining
in idolatrous &s;acrifices; the decorum to be
ob&s;erved in their religious a&s;&s;emblies, the
order of &s;peaking, the &s;ilence of women, the
covering or uncovering of the head, as it
became men, as it became women. The&s;e
&s;ubjects, with their &s;everal &s;ubdivi&s;ions, are
&s;o particular, minute, and numerous, that,
though they be exactly agreeable to the cir|cum&s;tances
of the per&s;ons to whom the
letter was written, nothing, I believe, but
the exi&s;tence and reality of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances,
could have &s;ugge&s;ted to the writer's
thoughts.</P>
<P>But this is not the only nor the principal
ob&s;ervation upon the corre&s;pondence be|tween
the church of Corinth and their
apo&s;tle, which I wi&s;h to point out. It
appears, I think, in this corre&s;pondence,
that although the Corinthians had written
to St. Paul, reque&s;ting his an&s;wer and his
directions in the &s;everal points above enu|merated,
yet that they had not &s;aid one
&s;yllable about the enormities and di&s;orders
which had crept in among&s;t them, and
in the blame of which they all &s;hared;
<PB N="69" REF="71">
but that St. Paul's information concerning
the irregularities then prevailing at Corinth,
had come round to him from other quarters.
The quarrels and di&s;putes excited by their
contentious adherence to their different
teachers, and by their placing of them in
competition with one another, were not
mentioned in their <HI>letter,</HI> but communi|cated
to St. Paul by more private intelli|gence:
"It hath been declared unto me,
my brethren, <HI>by them which are of the hou&s;e
of Chloe,</HI> that there are contentions among
you. Now this I &s;ay, that every one of
you &s;aith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Chri&s;t" (i. 11, 12).
The ince&s;tuous marriage "of a man with
his father's wife," which St. Paul repre|hends
with &s;o much &s;everity in the fifth
chapter of our epi&s;tle, and which was not
the crime of an individual only, but a crime
in which the whole church, by tolerating
and conniving at it, had rendered them&s;elves
partakers, did not come to St. Paul's know|ledge
by the <HI>letter,</HI> but by a rumour which
had reached his ears: "<HI>It is reported commonly</HI>
that there is fornication among you, and
<PB N="70" REF="72">
&s;uch fornication as is not &s;o much as
named among the Gentiles, that one
&s;hould have his father's wife; and ye are
puffed up, and have not rather mourned
that he that hath done this deed might be
taken away from among you" (v. 1, 2).
Their going to law before the judicature of
the country, rather than arbitrate and adju&s;t
their di&s;putes among them&s;elves, which St.
Paul animadverts upon with his u&s;ual plain|ne&s;s,
was not intimated to him in the <HI>letter,</HI>
becau&s;e he tells them his opinion of this
conduct, before he comes to the contents of
the letter. Their litigiou&s;ne&s;s is cen&s;ured
by St. Paul in the &s;ixth chapter of his
epi&s;tle, and it is only at the beginning of
the &s;eventh chapter that he proceeds upon
the articles which he found in their letter;
and he proceeds upon them with this pre|face:
"Now concerning the things whereof
ye wrote unto me" (vii. 1); which intro|duction
he would not have u&s;ed, if he had
been already di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any of the &s;ubjects
concerning which they had written. Their
irregularities in celebrating the Lord's &s;up|per,
and the utter perver&s;ion of the in&s;titu|tion
<PB N="71" REF="73">
which en&s;ued, were not in the <HI>letter</HI>:
as is evident from the terms in which St.
Paul mentions the notice he had received
of it: "Now in this that I declare unto
you, I prai&s;e you not, that ye came to|gether
not for the better, but for the
wor&s;e; for fir&s;t of all, when ye come
together in the church, <HI>I hear</HI> that there
be divi&s;ions among you, and <HI>I partly
believe it.</HI>" Now that the Corinthians
&s;hould, in their own letter, exhibit the fair
&s;ide of their conduct to the Apo&s;tle, and
conceal from him the faults of their beha|viour,
was extremely natural, and extremely
probable: but it was a di&s;tinction which
would not, I think, have ea&s;ily occurred to
the author of a forgery; and much le&s;s
likely is it, that it &s;hould have entered into
his thoughts to make the di&s;tinction <HI>appear</HI>
in the way in which it does appear, viz.
not by the original letter, not by any expre&s;s
ob&s;ervation upon it in the an&s;wer, but di&s;|tantly
by marks perceivable in the manner,
or in the order, in which St. Paul takes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of their faults.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="72" REF="74">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>Our epi&s;tle purports to have been written
after St. Paul had already been at Corinth:
"I, brethren, <HI>when I came to you,</HI> came not
with excellency of &s;peech or of wi&s;dom"
(ii. 1): and in many other places to the
&s;ame effect. It purports al&s;o to have been
written upon the eve of another vi&s;it to that
church: "I will come to you &s;hortly, if the
Lord will" (iv. 19); and again, "I will
come to you when I &s;hall pa&s;s through Ma|cedonia"
(xvi. 5). Now the hi&s;tory relates
that St. Paul did in fact vi&s;it Corinth <HI>twice</HI>;
once as recorded at length in the eighteenth,
and a &s;econd time as mentioned briefly in
the twentieth chapter of the Acts. The
&s;ame hi&s;tory al&s;o informs us, Acts xx. 1,
that it was from Ephe&s;us St. Paul proceeded
upon his &s;econd journey into Greece. There|fore,
as the epi&s;tle purports to have been
written a &s;hort time preceding that jour|ney;
and as St. Paul, the hi&s;tory tells us,
had re&s;ided more than two years at Ephe&s;us
before he &s;et out upon it, it follows that it
mu&s;t have been from Ephe&s;us, to be con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="73" REF="75">
with the hi&s;tory, that the epi&s;tle was
written; and every note of <HI>place</HI> in the
epi&s;tle agrees with this &s;uppo&s;ition. "If,
after the manner of men, I have fought
with bea&s;ts at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> what advantageth
it me, if the dead ri&s;e not?" (xv. 32). I
allow that the apo&s;tle might &s;ay this, where|ever
he was; but it was more natural and
more to the purpo&s;e to &s;ay it, if he was at
Ephe&s;us at the time, and in the mid&s;t of
tho&s;e conflicts to which the expre&s;&s;ion re|lates.
"The churches of A&s;ia &s;alute you"
(xvi. 19). A&s;ia, throughout the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles and the epi&s;tles of St. Paul, does
not mean the whole of A&s;ia Minor or Ana|tolia,
nor even the whole of the procon&s;ular
A&s;ia, but a di&s;trict in the anterior part of
that country, called Lydian A&s;ia, divided
from the re&s;t, much as Portugal is from
Spain, and of which di&s;trict <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> was the
capital.&mdash;"Aquila and Pri&s;cilla &s;alute you"
(xvi. 19). Aquila and Pri&s;cilla were at
<HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> during the period within which this
epi&s;tle was written (Acts xviii. 18. 26).&mdash;"I
will tarry at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> until Penteco&s;t"
(xvi. 8). This, I apprehend, is in terms al|mo&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="76">
a&s;&s;erting that he was at Ephe&s;us at the
time of writing the epi&s;tle.&mdash;"A great and
effectual door is opened unto me" (xvi. 9).
How well this declaration corre&s;ponded with
the &s;tate of things at Ephe&s;us, and the pro|gre&s;s
of the Go&s;pel in the&s;e parts, we learn
from the reflection with which the hi&s;torian
concludes the account of certain tran&s;actions
which pa&s;&s;ed there: "So mightily grew the
word of God and prevailed" (Acts xix. 20);
as well as from the complaint of Demetrius,
"that not only at Ephe&s;us, but al&s;o through|out
all A&s;ia, this Paul hath per&s;uaded and
turned away much people" (xix. 26).&mdash;"And
there are many adver&s;aries," &s;ays the
epi&s;tle, xvi. 9. Look into the hi&s;tory of
this period, "when divers were hardened
and believed not, but &s;pake evil of that
way before the multitude, he departed from
them, and &s;eparated the di&s;ciples." The
conformity therefore upon this head of
compari&s;on, is circum&s;tantial and perfect.
If any one think that this is a conformity
&s;o obvious, that any forger of tolerable cau|tion
and &s;agacity, would have taken care to
pre&s;erve it, I mu&s;t de&s;ire &s;uch a one to read
<PB N="75" REF="77">
the epi&s;tle for him&s;elf; and, when he has
done &s;o, to declare, whether he has di&s;co|vered
one mark of art or de&s;ign; whether
the notes of <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place</HI> appear to him
to be in&s;erted with any reference to each
other, with any view of their being com|pared
with each other, or for the purpo&s;e
of e&s;tabli&s;hing a vi&s;ible agreement with the
hi&s;tory, in re&s;pect of them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 17-19. "For this cau&s;e
I have &s;ent unto you Timotheus, who is
my beloved &s;on and faithful in the Lord,
who &s;hall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Chri&s;t, as I teach
every where in every church. Now &s;ome
are puffed up, as though I would not
come unto you; but I will come unto you
&s;hortly, if the Lord will."</P>
<P>With this I compare Acts xix. 21, 22:
"After the&s;e things were ended, Paul pur|po&s;ed
in the &s;pirit, when he had pa&s;&s;ed
through Macedonia and <HI>Achaia,</HI> to go to
Jeru&s;alem; &s;aying, after I have been there,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee Rome: <HI>&s;o</HI> he &s;ent unto
Macedonia two of them that mini&s;tered
unto him, <HI>Tim&ocirc;theus</HI> and Era&s;tus."</P>
<P>Though it be not &s;aid, it appears I think
with &s;ufficient certainty, I mean from the
hi&s;tory, independently of the epi&s;tle, that
Timothy was &s;ent upon this occa&s;ion into
<HI>Achaia,</HI> of which Corinth was the capital city,
as well as into Macedonia; for the &s;ending
of Timothy and Era&s;tus is, in the pa&s;&s;age
where it is mentioned, plainly connected with
St. Paul's own journey; <HI>he &s;ent them before
him.</HI> As he therefore purpo&s;ed to go into
<HI>Achaia</HI> him&s;elf, it is highly probable that
they were to go thither al&s;o. Neverthele&s;s
they are &s;aid only to have been &s;ent into
Macedonia, becau&s;e Macedonia was in truth
the country to which they went immediately
from Ephe&s;us; being directed, as we &s;up|po&s;e,
to proceed afterwards from thence
into Achaia. If this be &s;o, the narrative
agrees with the epi&s;tle; and the agreement
is attended with very little appearance of
de&s;ign. One thing at lea&s;t concerning it is
certain: that if this pa&s;&s;age of St. Paul's
hi&s;tory had been taken from his letter, it
<PB N="77" REF="79">
would have &s;ent Timothy to Corinth by
name, or expre&s;sly however into Achaia.</P>
<P>But there is another circum&s;tance in the&s;e
two pa&s;&s;ages much le&s;s obvious, in which
an agreement holds, without any room for
&s;u&s;picion that it was produced by de&s;ign.
We have ob&s;erved that the &s;ending of Ti|mothy
into the penin&s;ula of Greece was
connected in the narrative with St. Paul's
own journey thither; it is &s;tated as the
effect of the &s;ame re&s;olution. Paul pur|po&s;ed
to go into Macedonia; "<HI>&s;o</HI> he &s;ent
two of them that mini&s;tered unto him, Ti|motheus
and Era&s;tus." Now in the epi|&s;tle
al&s;o you remark that, when the apo&s;tle
mentions his having &s;ent Timothy unto
them, in the very next &s;entence he &s;peaks
of his own vi&s;it: "for this cau&s;e have I
&s;ent unto you Timotheus, who is my be|loved
&s;on, &amp;c. Now &s;ome are puffed up, as
though I would not come to you; but I
will come to you &s;hortly, if God will."
Timothy's journey we &s;ee is mentioned in
the hi&s;tory, and in the epi&s;tle, in clo&s;e con|nection
with St. Paul's own. Here is the
&s;ame order of thought and intention; yet
<PB N="78" REF="80">
conveyed under &s;uch diver&s;ity of circum|&s;tance
and expre&s;&s;ion, and the mention of
them in the epi&s;tle &s;o allied to the occa&s;ion
which introduces it, viz. the in&s;inuation of
his adver&s;aries that he would come to Co|rinth
no more, that I am per&s;uaded no at|tentive
reader will believe, that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages
were written in concert with one another,
or will doubt but that the agreement is un|&s;ought
and uncontrived.</P>
<P>But, in the Acts, Era&s;tus accompanied
Timothy in this journey, of whom no men|tion
is made in the epi&s;tle. From what has
been &s;aid, in our ob&s;ervations upon the Epi&s;tle
to the Romans, it appears probable that Era&s;|tus
was a Corinthian. If &s;o, though he ac|companied
Timothy to Corinth, he was only
returning home, and Timothy was the me&s;|&s;enger
charged with St. Paul's orders. At
any rate, this di&s;crepancy &s;hews that the
pa&s;&s;ages were not taken from one another.</P>

the Lord, as I al&s;o do: let no man therefore
de&s;pi&s;e him, but conduct him forth in
peace, that he may come unto me, for I
look for him with the brethren."</P>
<P>From the pa&s;&s;age con&s;idered in the pre|ceding
number, it appears that Timothy
was &s;ent to Corinth, either with the epi&s;tle,
or before it: "for this cau&s;e have I &s;ent
unto you Timotheus." From the pa&s;&s;age
now quoted, we infer that Timothy was not
&s;ent <HI>with</HI> the epi&s;tle; for had he been the
bearer of the letter, or accompanied it, would
St. Paul in that letter have &s;aid, "<HI>if</HI> Timothy
come?" Nor is the &s;equel con&s;i&s;tent with the
&s;uppo&s;ition of his carrying the letter; for if
Timothy was with the Apo&s;tle when he wrote
the letter, could he &s;ay, as he does, "I look
for him with the brethren?" I conclude
therefore that Timothy had left St. Paul to
proceed upon his journey before the letter
was written. Farther, the pa&s;&s;age before us
&s;eems to imply, that Timothy was not ex|pected
by St. Paul to arrive at Corinth, till
after they had received the letter. He gives
them directions in the letter how to treat
him when he &s;hould arrive; "if he come,"
<PB N="80" REF="82">
act towards him &s;o and &s;o. La&s;tly, the
whole form of expre&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t naturally
applicable to the &s;uppo&s;ition of Timothy's
coming to Corinth, not directly from St.
Paul, but from &s;ome other quarter; and that
his in&s;tructions had been, when he &s;hould
reach Corinth, to return. Now, how &s;tands
this matter in the hi&s;tory? Turn to the nine|teenth
chapter and twenty-fir&s;t ver&s;e of the
Acts, and you will find that Timothy did
not, when &s;ent from Ephe&s;us, where he left
St. Paul, and where the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle was
written, proceed by a &s;traight cour&s;e to Co|rinth,
but that he went round through Ma|cedonia.
This clears up every thing; for,
although Timothy was &s;ent forth upon his
journey before the letter was written, yet
he might not reach Corinth till after the
letter arrived there; and he would come to
Corinth, when he did come, not directly
from St. Paul at Ephe&s;us, but from &s;ome
part of Macedonia. Here therefore is a
circum&s;tantial and critical agreement, and
unque&s;tionably without de&s;ign; for neither
of the two pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tle mentions
Timothy's journey into Macedonia at all,
<PB N="81" REF="83">
though nothing but a circuit of that kind
can explain and reconcile the expre&s;&s;ions
which the writer u&s;es.</P>

<P>Chap. 1. ver. 12. "Now this I &s;ay, that
every one of you &s;aith, I am of Paul, and
I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of
Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Al&s;o, iii. 6, "I have planted, Apollos wa|tered,
but God gave the increa&s;e."</P>
<P>This expre&s;&s;ion; "I have planted, Apollos
watered," imports two things; fir&s;t, that Paul
had been at Corinth before Apollos; &s;econdly,
that Apollos had been at Corinth after Paul,
but before the writing of this epi&s;tle. This im|plied
account of the &s;everal events, and of the
order in which they took place, corre&s;ponds
exactly with the hi&s;tory. St. Paul, after his
fir&s;t vi&s;it into Greece, returned from Corinth
into Syria by the way of Ephe&s;us; and, drop|ping
his companions Aquila and Pri&s;cilla at
Ephe&s;us, he proceeded forwards to Jeru&s;alem:
from Jeru&s;alem he de&s;cended to Antioch; and
from thence made a progre&s;s through &s;ome
<PB N="82" REF="84">
of the upper or northern provinces of the
Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia (Acts xviii. 19. 23): during which
progre&s;s, and con&s;equently in the interval
between St. Paul's fir&s;t and &s;econd vi&s;it to
Corinth, and con&s;equently al&s;o before the
writing of this epi&s;tle, which was at Ephe|&s;us
two years at lea&s;t after the apo&s;tle's re|turn
from his progre&s;s, we hear of Apollos,
and we hear of him at Corinth. Whil&s;t St.
Paul was engaged, as hath been &s;aid, in
Phrygia and Galatia, Apollos came down to
Ephe&s;us; and being, in St. Paul's ab&s;ence, in|&s;tructed
by Aquila and Pri&s;cilla, and having
obtained letters of recommendation from the
church at Ephe&s;us, he pa&s;&s;ed over to Achaia;
and when he was there, we read that he
"helped them much which had believed
through grace, for he mightily convinced
the Jews, and that publicly." Acts xviii. 27,
28. To have brought Apollos into Achaia,
of which Corinth was the capital city, as well
as the principal Chri&s;tian church; and to
have &s;hewn that he preached the go&s;pel in
that country, would have been &s;ufficient for
our purpo&s;e. But the hi&s;tory happens al&s;o
to mention Corinth by name, as the place
<PB N="83" REF="85">
in which Apollos, after his arrival in Achaia,
fixed his re&s;idence; for, proceeding with the
account of St. Paul's travels, it tells us, that
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having
pa&s;&s;ed through the upper coa&s;ts, came down
to Ephe&s;us (xix. 1). What is &s;aid there|fore
of Apollos, in the epi&s;tle, coincides ex|actly,
and e&s;pecially in the point of chrono|logy,
with what is delivered concerning him
in the hi&s;tory. The only que&s;tion now is,
whether the allu&s;ions were made with a re|gard
to this coincidence. Now, the occa|&s;ions
and purpo&s;es for which the name of
Apollos is introduced in the Acts and in
the epi&s;tles, are &s;o independent and &s;o re|mote,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the
&s;malle&s;t reference from one to the other.
Apollos is mentioned in the Acts, in im|mediate
connection with the hi&s;tory of
Aquila and Pri&s;cilla, and for the very &s;in|gular
circum&s;tance of his "knowing only
the bapti&s;m of John." In the epi&s;tle, where
none of the&s;e circum&s;tances are taken notice
of, his name fir&s;t occurs, for the purpo&s;e of
reproving the contentious &s;pirit of the Co|rinthians;
and it occurs only in conjunction
<PB N="84" REF="86">
with that of &s;ome others: "Every one of
you &s;aith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Chri&s;t." The
&s;econd pa&s;&s;age in which Apollos appears,
"I have planted, Apollos watered," fixes,
as we have ob&s;erved, the order of time
among&s;t three di&s;tinct events; but it fixes
this, I will venture to pronounce, without
the writer perceiving that he was doing any
&s;uch thing. The &s;entence fixes this order
in exact conformity with the hi&s;tory; but it
is it&s;elf introduced &s;olely for the &s;ake of the
reflection which follows: "Neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that wa|tereth,
but God that giveth the increa&s;e."</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 11, 12. "Even unto this
pre&s;ent hour we both hunger and thir&s;t,
and are naked, and are buffetted, and have
no certain dwelling-place; and labour,
working with our own hands."</P>
<P>We are expre&s;sly told, in the hi&s;tory, that
at Corinth St. Paul laboured with his own
hands: "He found Aquila and Pri&s;cilla; and,
becau&s;e he was of the &s;ame craft, he abode
<PB N="85" REF="87">
with them, and wrought; for by their oc|cupation
they were tent-makers." But,
in the text before us, he is made to &s;ay,
that "he laboured <HI>even unto the pre&s;ent hour,</HI>"
that is, to the time of writing the epi&s;tle at
Ephe&s;us. Now, in the narration of St.
Paul's tran&s;actions at Ephe&s;us, delivered in
the nineteenth chapter of the Acts, nothing
is &s;aid of his working with his own hands;
but in the twentieth chapter we read, that
upon his return from Greece, he &s;ent for
the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us, to
meet him at Miletus; and in the di&s;cour&s;e
which he there addre&s;&s;ed to them, amid&s;t
&s;ome other reflections which he calls to
their remembrance, we find the following:
"I have coveted no man's &s;ilver, or gold,
or apparel; yea, you your&s;elves al&s;o know,
that the&s;e hands have mini&s;tered unto my
nece&s;&s;ities, and to them that were with me."
The reader will not forget to remark, that
though St. Paul be now at Miletus, it is to
the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us he is
&s;peaking, when he &s;ays, "Ye your&s;elves
know that the&s;e hands have mini&s;tered to
my nece&s;&s;ities;" and that the whole di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="88">
relates to his conduct, during his
la&s;t preceding re&s;idence at Ephe&s;us. That
manual labour therefore, which he had ex|erci&s;ed
at Corinth, he continued at Ephe&s;us;
and not only &s;o, but continued it during
that particular re&s;idence at Ephe&s;us, near
the conclu&s;ion of which this epi&s;tle was
written: &s;o that he might, with the &s;tricte&s;t
truth, &s;ay, at the time of writing the epi&s;tle,
"Even <HI>unto this pre&s;ent hour</HI> we labour,
working with our own hands." The
corre&s;pondency is &s;ufficient then, as to the
unde&s;ignedne&s;s of it. It is manife&s;t to my
judgment, that if the hi&s;tory, in this article,
had been taken from the epi&s;tle, this cir|cum&s;tance,
if it appeared at all, would have
appeared in its <HI>place,</HI> that is, in the direct
account of St. Paul's tran&s;actions at Ephe|&s;us.
The corre&s;pondency would not have
been effected, as it is, by a kind of reflected
&s;troke, that is, by a reference in a &s;ub&s;equent
&s;peech, to what in the narrative was omitted.
Nor is it likely, on the other hand, that a
circum&s;tance which is not extant in the
hi&s;tory of St. Paul at Ephe&s;us, &s;hould have
been made the &s;ubject of a factitious allu&s;ion,
<PB N="87" REF="89">
in an epi&s;tle purporting to be written by
him from that place: not to mention that
the allu&s;ion it&s;elf, e&s;pecially as to time, is
too oblique and general to an&s;wer any pur|po&s;e
of forgery whatever.</P>

<P>Chap. ix. ver. 20. "And unto the Jews
I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as
under the law."</P>
<P>We have the di&s;po&s;ition here de&s;cribed,
exemplified in two in&s;tances which the hi&s;|tory
records; one, Acts xvi. ver. 3: "Him
(Timothy) would Paul have to go forth
with him, and took and circumci&s;ed him,
<HI>becau&s;e of the Jews in tho&s;e quarters</HI>; for
they knew all that his father was a Greek."
This was before the writing of the epi&s;tle.
The other, Acts xxi. ver. 23, 26, and after
the writing of the epi&s;tle: "Do this that we
&s;ay to thee: we have four men which have
a vow on them: them take, and purify
thy&s;elf with them, that they may &s;have
their heads; and all may know that tho&s;e
things, whereof they were informed con|cerning
<PB N="88" REF="90">
thee, are nothing; but that thou
thy&s;elf al&s;o walke&s;t orderly, and keepe&s;t
the law.&mdash;Then Paul took the men, and
the next day, <HI>purifying him&s;elf with them,
entered into the temple.</HI>" Nor does this
concurrence between the character and the
in&s;tances look like the re&s;ult of contrivance.
St. Paul, in the epi&s;tle, de&s;cribes, or is made
to de&s;cribe, his own accommodating conduct
towards Jews and towards Gentiles, towards
the weak and over-&s;crupulous, towards men
indeed of every variety of character; "to
them that are without law as without law,
being not without law to God, but under
the law to Chri&s;t, that I might gain them
that are without law; to the weak became
I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I
am made all things to all men, that I might
gain &s;ome." This is the &s;equel of the text
which &s;tands at the head of the pre&s;ent num|ber.
Taking therefore the whole pa&s;&s;age
together, the apo&s;tle's conde&s;cen&s;ion to the
Jews is mentioned only as a part of his
general di&s;po&s;ition towards all. It is not
probable, that this character &s;hould have
been made up from the in&s;tances in the
<PB N="89" REF="91">
Acts, which relate &s;olely to his dealings with
the Jews. It is not probable that a &s;ophi&s;t
&s;hould take his hint from tho&s;e in&s;tances,
and then extend it &s;o much beyond them:
and it is &s;till more incredible, that the two
in&s;tances in the Acts, circum&s;tantially re|lated,
and interwoven with the hi&s;tory,
&s;hould have been fabricated in order to &s;uit
the character, which St. Paul gives of him&s;elf
in the epi&s;tle.</P>

of Stephanas: be&s;ides, I know not
whether I baptized any other; for Chri&s;t
&s;ent me not to baptize, but to preach the
go&s;pel."</P>
<P>It may be expected that tho&s;e whom the
apo&s;tle baptized with his own hands, were
converts di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by &s;ome
circum&s;tance, either of eminence, or of con|nection
with him. Accordingly, of the three
<PB N="90" REF="92">
names here mentioned, Cri&s;pus, we find,
from Acts xviii. ver. 8, was a "chief ruler
of the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue at Corinth, who
believed in the Lord, with all his hou&s;e."
Gaius, it appears from Romans xvi. 23,
was St. Paul's ho&s;t at Corinth, and the ho&s;t,
he tells us, "of the whole church." The
hou&s;ehold of Stephanas, we read in the &s;ix|teenth
chapter of this epi&s;tle, "were the fir&s;t
fruits of Achaia." Here therefore is the
propriety we expected: and it is a proof
of reality not to be contemned; for their
names appearing in the &s;everal places in
which they occur, with a mark of di&s;tinc|tion
belonging to each, could hardly be
the effect of chance, without any truth to
direct it: and, on the other hand, to &s;up|po&s;e
that they were picked out from the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages, and brought together in the text
before us, in order to di&s;play a conformity
of names, is both improbable in it&s;elf, and is
rendered more &s;o, by the purpo&s;e for which
they are introduced. They come in to a&s;&s;i&s;t
St. Paul's exculpation of him&s;elf, again&s;t the
po&s;&s;ible charge, of having a&s;&s;umed the cha|racter
<PB N="91" REF="93">
of the founder of a &s;eparate religion,
and with no other vi&s;ible, or, as I think,
imaginable de&s;ign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. ver. 1. "Paul called to be an apo&s;tle or Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through the will of God, and So&s;thenes, our brother, unto the church of God, which is at Corinth."&mdash;The only account we have of any per&s;on who bore the name of So&s;thenes, is found in the eight|eenth chapter of the Acts. When the Jews at Corinth had brought Paul before Gallio, and Gallio had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their complaint as unworthy of his interference, and had driven them from the judgment-&s;eat; "then all the Greeks," &s;ays the hi&s;torian, "took So&s;thenes, the chief ruler of the &s;ynagogue, and beat him before the judg|ment-&s;eat." The So&s;thenes here &s;poken of was a Corinthian; and if he was a Chri&s;tian, and with St. Paul when he wrote this epi&s;tle, was likely enough to be joined with him in the &s;alutation of the Corinthian church. But here occurs a difficulty. If So&s;thenes was a Chri&s;tian at the time of this uproar, why &s;hould the <HI>Greeks</HI> beat him? The a&s;&s;ault upon the Chri&s;tians was made by the <HI>Jews.</HI> It was the <HI>Jews</HI> who had brought Paul before the magi&s;trate. If it had been the Jews al&s;o who had beaten So&s;thenes, I &s;hould not have doubted but that he had been a favourer of St. Paul, and the &s;ame per&s;on who is joined with him in the epi&s;tle. Let us &s;ee therefore whether there be not &s;ome error in our pre&s;ent text. The Alexandrian manu&s;cript gives <GAP DESC="foreign"> alone, without <GAP DESC="foreign">, and is followed in this reading by the Coptic ver&s;ion, by the Arabic ver&s;ion, publi&s;hed by Erpenius, by the Vulgate, and by Bede's Latin ver&s;ion. Three Greek manu&s;cripts again, as well as Chry&s;o&s;tom, give <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the place of <GAP DESC="foreign">. A great plurality of manu&s;cripts authorize the reading which is retained in our copies. In this variety it appears to me extreme|ly probable that the hi&s;torian originally wrote <GAP DESC="foreign"> alone, and that <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> have been re|&s;pectively added as explanatory of what the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> was &s;uppo&s;ed to mean. The &s;entence, without the addi|tion of either name, would run very per&s;picuou&s;ly thus: "<GAP DESC="foreign">: and he drove them away from the judgment-&s;eat; and they all," viz. the crowd of Jews whom the judge had bid begone, "took So&s;thenes, and beat him before the judg|ment &s;eat." It is certain that, as the whole body of the people were Greeks, the application of <HI>all</HI> to them is unu&s;ual and hard. If I was de&s;cribing an in&s;urrection at Paris, I might &s;ay <HI>all</HI> the Jews, <HI>all</HI> the Prote&s;tants, or <HI>all</HI> the Engli&s;h acted &s;o and &s;o; but I &s;hould &s;carcely &s;ay <HI>all</HI> the French, when the whole ma&s;s of the community were of that de&s;cription. As what is here offered is founded upon a various reading, and that in oppo&s;ition to the greater part of the manu&s;cripts that are extant, I have not given it a place in the text.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The churches of Galatia and Phrygia
were the la&s;t churches which St. Paul had

churches: "He went over all the country

only intended, but that he had promi&s;ed
them a vi&s;it before; for, otherwi&s;e, why
&s;hould he apologize for the change of his
purpo&s;e, or expre&s;s &s;o much anxiety, le&s;t this
change &s;hould be imputed to any culpable
ficklene&s;s in his temper; and le&s;t he &s;hould
thereby &s;eem to them, as one who&s;e word
was not, in any &s;ort, to be depended upon?
Be&s;ides which, the terms made u&s;e of plainly
refer to a promi&s;e: "Our <HI>word toward you</HI>
was not yea and nay." St. Paul therefore
had &s;ignified an intention which he had not
<PB N="96" REF="98">
been able to execute; and this &s;eeming
breach of his word, and the delay of his
vi&s;it, had, with &s;ome who were evil affected
towards him, given birth to a &s;ugge&s;tion
that he would come no more to Corinth.</P>

<P>Chap. v. ver. 7, 8. "For even Chri&s;t, our
pa&s;&s;over, is &s;acrificed for us; therefore let
us keep the fea&s;t, not with old leaven,
neither with the leaven of malice and
wickedne&s;s, but with the unleavened bread
of &s;incerity and truth."</P>
<P>Dr. Ben&s;on tells us, that from this pa&s;&s;age,
compared with chapter xvi. ver. 8, it has
been conjectured that this epi&s;tle was writ|ten
about the time of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over;
and to me the conjecture appears to be very
well founded. The pa&s;&s;age to which Dr.
Ben&s;on refers us is this: "I will tarry at
Ephe&s;us until Penteco&s;t." With this pa&s;|&s;age
he ought to have joined another in
the &s;ame context: "And it may be that I
will abide, yea and winter with you:"
for, from the two pa&s;&s;ages laid together, it
follows that the epi&s;tle was written before
<PB N="97" REF="99">
Penteco&s;t, yet after winter; which nece&s;&s;a|rily
determines the date to the part of the
year, within which the pa&s;&s;over falls. It
was written before Penteco&s;t, becau&s;e he
&s;ays, "I will tarry at Ephe&s;us until Pen|teco&s;t."
It was written after winter, be|cau&s;e
he tells them, "It may be that I may
abide, yea and winter with you." The
winter which the apo&s;tle purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s
at Corinth, was undoubtedly the winter
next en&s;uing to the date of the epi&s;tle; yet
it was a winter &s;ub&s;equent to the en&s;uing
Penteco&s;t, becau&s;e he did not intend to &s;et
forwards upon his journey till after that
fea&s;t. The words "let us keep the fea&s;t,
not with old leaven, neither with the lea|ven
of malice and wickedne&s;s, but with the
unleavened bread of &s;incerity and truth,"
look very like words &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ea&s;on;
at lea&s;t they have, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, a
force and &s;ignificancy which do not belong to
them upon any other; and it is not a little
remarkable, that the hints ca&s;ually dropped
in the epi&s;tle, concerning particular parts
of the year, &s;hould coincide with this &s;up|po&s;ition.</P>

<P>I WILL not &s;ay that it is impo&s;&s;ible,
having &s;een the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Co|rinthians,
to con&s;truct a &s;econd with o&s;ten|&s;ible
allu&s;ions to the fir&s;t; or that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
that both &s;ould be fabricated, &s;o

events. But I &s;ay, that this, in either ca&s;e,
mu&s;t be the effect of craft and de&s;ign.
Whereas, whoever examines the allu&s;ions
to the former epi&s;tle, which he finds in this,
whil&s;t he will acknowledge them to be &s;uch,
as would ri&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly to the hand of

either that the clau&s;es containing the&s;e allu|&s;ions
<PB N="99" REF="101">
were <HI>in&s;ertions</HI> for the purpo&s;e, or that
the &s;everal tran&s;actions of the Corinthian
church were feigned, in order to form a
train of narrative, or to &s;upport the appear|ance
of connection between the two epi&s;tles.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, St. Paul announces his
intention of pa&s;&s;ing through Macedonia, in
his way to Corinth: "I will come to you
when I &s;hall pa&s;s through Macedonia."
In the &s;econd epi&s;tle, we find him arrived
in Macedonia, and about to pur&s;ue his jour|ney
to Corinth. But ob&s;erve the manner
in which this is made to appear: "I know
the forwardne&s;s of your mind, for which
I boa&s;t of you to them of Macedonia,
that Achaia was ready a year ago, and
your zeal hath provoked very many:
yet have I &s;ent the brethren, le&s;t our
boa&s;ting of you &s;hould be in vain in this
behalf; that, as I &s;aid, ye may be ready,
le&s;t haply, if they of Macedonia come
with me, and find you unprepared, we,
that we &s;ay not you, be a&s;hamed in this
&s;ame confident boa&s;ting" (chap. ix. 2, 3, 4).
St. Paul's being in Macedonia at the time of
writing the epi&s;tle, is, in this pa&s;&s;age, in|ferred
<PB N="100" REF="102">
only from his &s;aying, that he had
boa&s;ted to the Macedonians of the alacrity
of his Achaian converts; and the fear which
he expre&s;&s;es, le&s;t, if any of the Macedonian
Chri&s;tians &s;hould come with him into
Achaia, they &s;hould &s;ind his boa&s;ting un|warranted
by the event. The bu&s;ine&s;s of
the contribution is the &s;ole cau&s;e of men|tioning
Macedonia at all. Will it be in|&s;inuated
that this pa&s;&s;age was framed merely
to &s;tate that St. Paul was now in Mace|donia;
and, by that &s;tatement, to produce
an apparent agreement with the purpo&s;e of
vi&s;iting Macedonia, notified in the fir&s;t epi|&s;tle?
Or will it be thought probable, that,
if a &s;ophi&s;t had meant to place St. Paul in
Macedonia, for the &s;ake of giving coun|tenance
to his forgery, he would have done
it in &s;o oblique a manner as through the
medium of the contribution? The &s;ame
thing may be ob&s;erved of another text in
the epi&s;tle, in which the name of Macedo|nia
occurs: "Furthermore, when I came to
Troas to preach the go&s;pel, and a door
was opened unto me of the Lord, I had
no re&s;t in my &s;pirit, becau&s;e I found not
<PB N="101" REF="103">
Titus, my brother; but taking my leave
of them, I went from thence into Mace|donia."
I mean, that it may be ob&s;erved
of this pa&s;&s;age al&s;o, that there is a rea&s;on for
mentioning Macedonia, entirely di&s;tinct from
the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing St. Paul to be <HI>there.</HI>
Indeed, if the pa&s;&s;age before us &s;hew that
point at all, it &s;hews it &s;o ob&s;curely, that
Grotius, though he did not doubt that Paul
was now in Macedonia, refers this text to
a different journey. Is this the hand of a
forger, meditating to e&s;tabli&s;h a fal&s;e con|formity?
The text, however, in which it is
mo&s;t &s;trongly implied that St. Paul wrote
the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle from Macedonia, is found
in the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth ver&s;es of the
&s;eventh chapter: "I am filled with comfort,
I am exceeding joyful in all our tribula|tion;
for, when we were come into Mace|donia,
our fle&s;h had no re&s;t; without were
fightings, within were fears; neverthe|le&s;s
God, that comforteth tho&s;e that are
ca&s;t down, comforted us by the coming
of Titus." Yet even here, I think, no
one will contend, that St. Paul's coming to
Macedonia, or being in Macedonia, was the
<PB N="102" REF="104">
principal thing intended to be told; or that
the telling of it indeed, was any part of the
intention with which the text was written;
or that the mention even of the name of
Macedonia was not purely incidental, in the
de&s;cription of tho&s;e tumultuous &s;orrows with
which the writer's mind had been lately
agitated, and from which he was relieved
by the coming of Titus. The &s;ive fir&s;t
ver&s;es of the eighth chapter, which commend
the liberality of the Macedonian churches,
do not, in my opinion, by them&s;elves prove
St. Paul to have been in Macedonia, at the
time of writing the epi&s;tle.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, St. Paul denounces
a &s;evere cen&s;ure again&s;t an ince&s;tuous mar|riage,
which had taken place among&s;t the
Corinthian converts, with the connivance,
not to &s;ay with the approbation, of the
church; and enjoins the church to purge
it&s;elf of this &s;candal, by expelling the of|fender
from its &s;ociety: "It is reported
commonly, that there is fornication among
you, and &s;uch fornication, as is not &s;o
much as named among&s;t the Gentiles, that
one &s;hould have his father's wife; and ye
<PB N="103" REF="105">
are puffed up, and have not rather mourn|ed,
that he that hath done this deed might
be taken away from among you; for I,
verily, as ab&s;ent in body, but pre&s;ent in
&s;pirit, have judged already, as though I
were pre&s;ent, concerning him that hath &s;o
done this deed; in the name of our Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when ye are gathered toge|ther,
and my &s;pirit, with the power of
our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to deliver &s;uch a
one unto Satan for the de&s;truction of the
fle&s;h, that the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the
day of the Lord" (chap. v. ver. 1-5).
In the &s;econd epi&s;tle, we &s;ind this &s;entence
executed, and the offender to be &s;o affected
with the puni&s;hment, that St. Paul now in|tercedes
for his re&s;toration: "Sufficient to
&s;uch a man is this puni&s;hment, which was
inflicted of many; &s;o that, contrariwi&s;e, ye
ought rather to &s;orgive him and comfort
him, le&s;t perhaps &s;uch a one &s;hould be
&s;wallowed up with over-much &s;orrow;
wherefore I be&s;eech you, that ye would
confirm your love towards him" (2 Cor.
chap. ii. ver. 7, 8). Is this whole bu&s;ine&s;s
feigned for the &s;ake of carrying on a conti|nuation
<PB N="104" REF="106">
of &s;tory through the two epi&s;tles?
The church al&s;o, no le&s;s than the offender,
was brought by St. Paul's reproof to a deep
&s;en&s;e of the impropriety of their conduct.
Their penitence, and their re&s;pect to his au|thority,
were, as might be expected, exceed|ingly
grateful to St. Paul: "We were com|forted
not by Titus's coming only, but by
the con&s;olation wherewith he was com|forted
in you, when he told us your earne&s;t
de&s;ire, your mourning, your fervent mind
towards me, &s;o that I rejoiced the more;
for, bough I made you &s;orry with a
letter, I do not repent, though I did re|pent;
for I perceive that the &s;ame epi&s;tle
made you &s;orry, though it were but for a
&s;ea&s;on. Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made &s;orry, but that ye &s;orrowed to re|pentance;
for ye were made &s;orry after a
godly manner, that ye might receive da|mage
by us in nothing" (chap. vii. 7-9).
That this pa&s;&s;age is to be referred to the
ince&s;tuous marriage, is proved by the twelfth
ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter: "Though I
wrote unto you, I did it not for his cau&s;e
that had done the wrong, nor for his cau&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="107">
that &s;uffered wrong; but that our care for
you, in the &s;ight of God, might appear
unto you." There were, it is true, various
topics of blame noticed in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle;
but there was none, except this of the in|ce&s;tuous
marriage, which could be called a
tran&s;action between private parties, or of
which it could be &s;aid that one particular
per&s;on had "done the wrong," and another
particular per&s;on "had &s;uffered it." Could all
this be without foundation? or could it be
put into the &s;econd epi&s;tle, merely to furni&s;h
an ob&s;cure &s;equel to what had been &s;aid about
an ince&s;tuous marriage in the fir&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3. In the &s;ixteenth chapter of the fir&s;t
epi&s;tle, a collection for the &s;aints is recom|mended
to be &s;et forwards at Corinth:
"Now, concerning the collection for the
&s;aints, as I have given order to the
churches of Galatia, &s;o do ye" (chap. xvi.
ver. 1). In the ninth chapter of the &s;econd
epi&s;tle, &s;uch a collection is &s;poken of, as in
readine&s;s to be received: "As touching the
mini&s;tering to the &s;aints, it is &s;uperfluous
for me to write to you, for I know the
forwardne&s;s of your mind, for which I
<PB N="106" REF="108">
boa&s;t of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago, and your
zeal hath provoked very many" (chap. ix.
ver. 1, 2). This is &s;uch a continuation of
the tran&s;action as might be expected; or,
po&s;&s;ibly it will be &s;aid, as might ea&s;ily be
counterfeited: but there is a circum&s;tance
of nicety in the agreement between the two
epi&s;tles, which, I am convinced, the author
of a forgery would not have hit upon, or
which, if he had hit upon it, he would have
&s;et forth with more clearne&s;s. The &s;econd
epi&s;tle &s;peaks of the Corinthians as having
begun this eleemo&s;ynary bu&s;ine&s;s a year be|fore:
"This is expedient for you, who have
begun before, not only to do, but al&s;o to
be forward a year ago" (chap. viii. ver. 10).
"I boa&s;t of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago" (chap. ix.
ver. 2). From the&s;e texts it is evident, that
&s;omething had been done in the bu&s;ine&s;s a
year before. It appears, however, from
other texts in the epi&s;tle, that the contribu|tion
was not yet collected or paid; for bre|thren
were &s;ent from St. Paul to Corinth,
"to make up their bounty" (chap. ix. ver. 5).
<PB N="107" REF="109">
They are urged to "perform the doing of
it" (chap. viii. ver. 11). "And every
man was exhorted to give as he purpo&s;ed
in his heart" (chap. ix. ver. 7). The
contribution therefore, as repre&s;ented in our
pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, was in readine&s;s, yet not re|ceived
from the contributors; was begun,
was forward long before, yet not hitherto
collected. Now this repre&s;entation agrees
with one, and only with one &s;uppo&s;ition,
namely, that every man had laid by in &s;tore,
had already provided the fund, from which
he was afterwards to contribute&mdash;the very
ca&s;e which the fir&s;t epi&s;tle authori&s;es us to
&s;uppo&s;e to have exi&s;ted; for in that epi&s;tle
St. Paul had charged the Corinthians, "up|on
the fir&s;t day of the week, every one of
them to lay by in &s;tore as God had pro|&s;pered
him"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following ob&s;ervations will &s;atisfy us concern|ing the purity of our Apo&s;tle's conduct in the &s;u&s;picious bu&s;ine&s;s of a pecuniary contribution.</P>
<P N="1">1. He di&s;claims the having received any in&s;pired au|thority for the directions which he is giving: "I &s;peak not by commandment, but by occa&s;ion of the forward|ne&s;s of others, and to prove the &s;incerity of your love" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 8). Who, that had a &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e to an&s;wer by the recommending of &s;ub&s;criptions, would thus di&s;tingui&s;h, and thus lower the credit of his own recommendation?</P>
<P N="2">2. Although he a&s;&s;erts the general right of chri&s;tian mini&s;ters to a maintenance from their mini&s;try, yet he prote&s;ts again&s;t the making u&s;e of this right in his own per&s;on: "Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel; but I have u&s;ed none of the&s;e things, neither have I written the&s;e things that it &s;hould be &s;o done unto me; for it were better for me to die, than that any man &s;hould make my glorying, i. e. my profe&s;&s;ions of di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s, void" (1 Cor. chap. ix. ver. 14, 15).</P>
<P N="3">3. He repeatedly propo&s;es that there &s;hould be a&s;&s;o|ciates with him&s;elf in the management of the public bounty; not colleagues of his own appointment, but per|&s;ons elected for that purpo&s;e by the contributors them|&s;elves: "And when I come, whom&s;oever ye &s;hall ap|prove by your letters, them will I &s;end to bring your liberality unto Jeru&s;alem; and if it be meet that I go al&s;o, they &s;hall go with me" (1 Cor. chap. xvi. ver. 3, 4). And in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, what is here propo&s;ed, we find actually done, and done for the very purpo&s;e of guarding his character again&s;t any imputation that might be brought upon it, in the di&s;charge of a pecuniary tru&s;t: "And we have &s;ent with him the brother, who&s;e prai&s;e is in the go&s;pel throughout all the churches; and not that only, but who was al&s;o cho&s;en of the churches to travel with us with this grace (gift) which is admini&s;|tered by us to the glory of the &s;ame Lord, and the declaration of your ready mind; avoiding this, that no man &s;hould blame us in this abundance which is ad|mini&s;tered by us; providing for things hone&s;t, not only in the &s;ight of the Lord, but al&s;o in the &s;ight of men;" i. e. "not re&s;ting in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own integrity, but, in &s;uch a &s;ubject, careful al&s;o to approve our integrity to the public judgment" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 18-21).</P></NOTE> (1 Cor. chap. xvi. ver. 2).</P>

<P>In comparing the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the

we are &s;oon brought to ob&s;erve, not only
that there exi&s;ts no ve&s;tige either of the epi|&s;tle

the hi&s;tory from the epi&s;tle; but al&s;o that

&s;tripes &s;ave one; thrice was I beaten with

would this account have been given by a
writer, who either drew his knowledge of
St. Paul from that hi&s;tory, or who was care|ful
to pre&s;erve a conformity with it. The
account in the epi&s;tle, of St. Paul's e&s;cape
from Dama&s;cus, though agreeing in the
main fact with the account of the &s;ame
tran&s;action in the Acts, is related with &s;uch
difference of circum&s;tance, as renders it ut|terly

from the other. The two accounts, placed
by the &s;ide of each other, &s;tand as follows:</P>

<P>The opening of this epi&s;tle exhibits a
connection with the hi&s;tory, which alone
would &s;atisfy my mind, that the epi&s;tle was
written by St. Paul, and by St. Paul in the
&s;ituation in which the hi&s;tory places him.
Let it be remembered, that in the nineteenth
chapter of the Acts, St. Paul is repre&s;ented
as driven away from Ephe&s;us, or as leaving
however Ephe&s;us, in con&s;equence of an
uproar in that city, excited by &s;ome inte|re&s;ted
adver&s;aries of the new religion. The
account of the tumult is as follows: "When
they heard the&s;e &s;ayings," viz. Deme|trius's
complaint of the danger to be appre|hended
from St. Paul's mini&s;try to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
wor&s;hip of the Ephe&s;ian godde&s;s,
"they were full of wrath, and cried out,
&s;aying, Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians;
<PB N="112" REF="114">
and the whole city was filled with confu|&s;ion;
and having caught Gaius and Ari&s;|tarchus,
Paul's companions in travel, they
ru&s;hed with one accord into the theatre;
and when Paul would have entered in
unto the people, the di&s;ciples &s;uffered him
not; and certain of the chief of A&s;ia,
which were his friends, &s;ent unto him,
de&s;iring that he would not adventure him|&s;elf
into the theatre. Some, therefore,
cried one thing, and &s;ome another; for the
a&s;&s;embly was confu&s;ed, and the more part
knew not wherefore they were come to|gether.
And they drew Alexander out
of the multitude, the Jews putting him
forward; and Alexander beckoned with
his hand, and would have made his de|fence
unto the people; but, when they
knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice,
about the &s;pace of two hours, cried out,
Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.&mdash;And
after the uproar was cea&s;ed, Paul called
unto him the di&s;ciples, and embraced
them, and departed for to go into Mace|donia."
When he was arrived in Mace|donia,
he wrote the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the
<PB N="113" REF="115">
Corinthians which is now before us; and
he begins his epi&s;tle in this wi&s;e: "Ble&s;&s;ed
be God, even the father of our Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the father of mercies, and
the God of all comfort, who comforteth
us in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
our&s;elves are comforted of God. For, as
the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o
our con&s;olation al&s;o aboundeth by Chri&s;t:
and whether we be afflicted, it is for your
con&s;olation and &s;alvation, which is ef|fectual
in the enduring of the &s;ame &s;uffer|ings,
which we al&s;o &s;uffer; or whether we
be comforted, it is for your con&s;olation
and &s;alvation; and our hope of you is
&s;teadfa&s;t, knowing that, as ye are partakers
of the &s;ufferings, &s;o &s;hall ye be al&s;o of the
con&s;olation. For we would not, brethren,
have you ignorant of our trouble <HI>which
came to us in A&s;ia,</HI> that we were pre&s;&s;ed
out of mea&s;ure, above &s;trength, in&s;o|much
that we de&s;paired even of life; but
we had the &s;entence of death in our&s;elves,
that we &s;hould not tru&s;t in our&s;elves, but
<PB N="114" REF="116">
in God which rai&s;eth the dead, who de|livered
us from &s;o great a death, and doth
deliver; in whom we tru&s;t that he will
yet deliver us." Nothing could be more
expre&s;&s;ive of the circum&s;tances in which the
hi&s;tory de&s;cribes St. Paul to have been, at the
time when the epi&s;tle purports to be written;
or rather, nothing could be more expre&s;&s;ive
of the &s;en&s;ations ari&s;ing from the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
than this pa&s;&s;age. It is the calm
recollection of a mind emerged from the
confu&s;ion of in&s;tant danger. It is that de|votion
and &s;olemnity of thought, which fol|lows
a recent deliverance. There is ju&s;t
enough of particularity in the pa&s;&s;age, to &s;hew
that it is to be referred to the tumult at
Ephe&s;us: "We would not, brethren, have
you ignorant of our trouble which came
to us in A&s;ia." And there is nothing more;
no mention of Demetrius, of the &s;eizure of
St. Paul's friends, of the interference of the
town-clerk, of the occa&s;ion or nature of the
danger which St. Paul had e&s;caped, or even
of the city where it happened; in a word,
no recital from which a &s;u&s;picion could be
conceived, either that the author of the
<PB N="115" REF="117">
epi&s;tle had made u&s;e of the narrative in the
Acts; or, on the other hand, that he had
&s;ketched the outline, which the narrative in
the Acts only filled up. That the forger of
an epi&s;tle, under the name of St. Paul, &s;hould
borrow circum&s;tances from a hi&s;tory of St.
Paul then extant; or, that the author of a
hi&s;tory of St. Paul &s;hould gather materials
from letters bearing St. Paul's name, may be
credited: but I cannot believe that any forger
whatever &s;hould fall upon an expedient &s;o
re&s;ined, as to exhibit &s;entiments adapted to a
&s;ituation, and to leave his readers to &s;eek out
that &s;ituation from the hi&s;tory; &s;till le&s;s, that
the author of a hi&s;tory &s;hould go about to
frame facts and circum&s;tances, fitted to &s;up|ply
the &s;entiments which he found in the
letter. It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that it does
not appear from the hi&s;tory, that any danger
threatened St. Paul's life in the uproar at
Ephe&s;us, &s;o imminent as that, from which
in the epi&s;tle he repre&s;ents him&s;elf to have
been delivered. This matter, it is true, is
not &s;tated by the hi&s;torian in form; but the
per&s;onal danger of the apo&s;tle, we cannot
doubt, mu&s;t have been extreme, when the
<PB N="116" REF="118">
"whole city was filled with confu&s;ion;"
when the populace had "&s;eized his com|panions;"
when, in the di&s;traction of
his mind, he in&s;i&s;ted upon "coming forth
among&s;t them;" when the Chri&s;tians who
were about him "would not &s;uffer him;"
when "his friends, certain of the chief of
A&s;ia, &s;ent to him, de&s;iring that he would
not adventure him&s;elf in the tumult;"
when, la&s;tly, he was obliged to quit imme|diately
the place and the country, "and,
when the tumult was cea&s;ed, to depart
into Macedonia." All which particulars
are found in the narration, and ju&s;tify St.
Paul's own account, "that he was pre&s;&s;ed
out of mea&s;ure, above &s;trength, in&s;omuch
that he de&s;paired even of life, that he had
the &s;entence of death in him&s;elf;" <HI>i. e.</HI> that
he looked upon him&s;elf as a man condemned
to die.</P>

<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>It has already been remarked, that St.
Paul's original intention was to have vi&s;ited
Corinth in his way to Macedonia: "I was
minded to come unto you before, and to
pa&s;s by you into Macedonia" (2 Cor.
<PB N="117" REF="119">
chap. i. ver. 15, 16). It has al&s;o been remarked
that he changed this intention, and ulti|mately
re&s;olved upon going through Mace|donia
<HI>fir&s;t.</HI> Now upon this head there exi&s;ts
a circum&s;tance of corre&s;pondency between
our epi&s;tle and the hi&s;tory, which is not
very obvious to the reader's ob&s;ervation;
but which, when ob&s;erved, will be found,
I think, clo&s;e and exact. Which circum|&s;tance
is this: that though the change of
St. Paul's intention be expre&s;sly mentioned
only in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, yet it appears,
both from the hi&s;tory and from this &s;econd
epi&s;tle, that the change had taken place
before the writing of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle; that
it appears however from neither, otherwi&s;e
than by an inference, unnoticed perhaps by
almo&s;t every one who does not &s;it down
profe&s;&s;edly to the examination.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, how does this point appear
from the hi&s;tory? In the nineteenth chapter
of the Acts, and the twenty-fir&s;t ver&s;e, we
are told, that "Paul purpo&s;ed in the &s;pirit,
when he had pa&s;&s;ed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jeru&s;alem. So he
&s;ent into Macedonia two of them that
<PB N="118" REF="120">
mini&s;tered unto him, Timotheus and Era&s;|tus;
but he him&s;elf &s;tayed in A&s;ia for a
&s;ea&s;on." A &s;hort time after this, and evi|dently
in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame intention,
we find (chap. xx. ver. 1, 2) that "Paul
departed from Ephe&s;us for to go into
Macedonia; and that, when he had gone
over tho&s;e parts, he came into Greece."
The re&s;olution therefore of pa&s;&s;ing fir&s;t
through Macedonia, and from thence into
Greece, was formed by St. Paul previou&s;ly
to the &s;ending away of Timothy. The or|der
in which the two countries are men|tioned,
&s;hews the direction of his intended
route, "when he had pa&s;&s;ed through Mace|donia
and Achaia." Timothy and Era&s;tus,
who were to precede him in his progre&s;s,
were &s;ent by him from Ephe&s;us into Mace|donia.
He him&s;elf a &s;hort time afterwards,
and, as hath been ob&s;erved, evidently in
continuation and pur&s;uance of the &s;ame de|&s;ign,
"departed for to go into Macedonia."
If he had ever therefore entertained a diffe|rent
plan of his journey, which is not hinted
in the hi&s;tory, he mu&s;t have changed that
plan before this time. But, from the &s;even|teenth
<PB N="119" REF="121">
ver&s;e of the fourth chapter of the fir&s;t
Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, we di&s;cover, that
Timothy had been &s;ent away from Ephe&s;us
before that epi&s;tle was written: "For this
cau&s;e have I &s;ent unto you Timotheus,
who is my beloved &s;on." The change
therefore of St. Paul's re&s;olution, which was
prior to the &s;ending away of Timothy, was
nece&s;&s;arily prior to the writing of the fir&s;t
Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the order of dates, as collected
from the hi&s;tory, compared with the fir&s;t
epi&s;tle. Now let us enquire, &s;econdly, how
this matter is repre&s;ented in the epi&s;tle be|fore
us. In the &s;ixteenth ver&s;e of the fir&s;t
chapter of this epi&s;tle, St. Paul &s;peaks of
the intention which he had once entertained
of vi&s;iting Achaia, in his way to Macedonia:
"In this confidence I was minded to come
unto you before, that ye might have a &s;e|cond
benefit; and to pa&s;s by you into
Macedonia." After prote&s;ting, in the &s;e|venteenth
ver&s;e, again&s;t any evil con&s;truc|tion
that might be put upon his laying a&s;ide
of this intention, in the twenty-third ver&s;e
he di&s;clo&s;es the cau&s;e of it: "Moreover I
<PB N="120" REF="122">
call God for a record upon my &s;oul, that,
to &s;pare you, I came not as yet unto Co|rinth."
And then he proceeds as follows:
"But I determined this with my&s;elf, that
I would not come again to you in heavi|ne&s;s;
for if I make you &s;orry, who is he
then that maketh me glad, but the &s;ame
which is made &s;orry by me? <HI>And I wrote
this &s;ame unto you,</HI> le&s;t when I came I
&s;hould have &s;orrow from them of whom
I ought to rejoice; having confidence in
you all, that my joy is the joy of you all:
for, out of much affliction and angui&s;h of
heart, <HI>I wrote unto you with many tears</HI>;
not that ye &s;hould be grieved, but that ye
might know the love which I have more
abundantly unto you; but if any have
cau&s;ed grief, he hath not grieved me but
in part, that I may not overcharge you
all. Sufficient to &s;uch a man is this pu|ni&s;hment,
which was inflicted of many."
In this quotation, let the reader fir&s;t direct
his attention to the clau&s;e marked by Italics,
"and I wrote this &s;ame unto you;" and let
him con&s;ider, whether from the context, and
from the &s;tructure of the whole pa&s;&s;age, it
<PB N="121" REF="123">
be not evident that this writing was after
St. Paul had "determined with him&s;elf, that
he would not come again to them in hea|vine&s;s?"
whether, indeed, it was not in
con&s;equence of this determination, or at lea&s;t
with this determination upon his mind?
And, in the next place, let him con&s;ider,
whether the &s;entence, "I determined this
with my&s;elf, that I would not come again
to you in heavine&s;s," do not plainly refer
to that po&s;tponing of his vi&s;it, to which he
had alluded in the ver&s;e but one before, when
he &s;aid, "I call God for a record upon my
&s;oul, that, to &s;pare you, I came not as yet
to Corinth;" and whether this be not the
vi&s;it of which he &s;peaks in the &s;ixteenth
ver&s;e, wherein he informs the Corinthians,
"that he had been minded to pa&s;s by them
into Macedonia;" but that, for rea&s;ons
which argued no levity or ficklene&s;s in his
di&s;po&s;ition, he had been compelled to change
his purpo&s;e. If this be &s;o, then it follows
that the writing here mentioned was po&s;te|rior
to the change of his intention. The
only que&s;tion, therefore, that remains will
be, whether this writing relate to the letter
<PB N="122" REF="124">
which we now have under the title of the
fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, or to &s;ome
other letter not extant? And upon this que&s;|tion
I think Mr. Locke's ob&s;ervation deci|&s;ive;
namely, that the &s;econd clau&s;e marked
in the quotation by Italics, "I wrote unto
you with many tears," and the fir&s;t clau&s;e
&s;o marked, "I wrote this &s;ame unto you,"
belong to one writing, whatever that was;
and that the &s;econd clau&s;e goes on to advert
to a circum&s;tance which is found in our pre|&s;ent
fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians; namely,
the ca&s;e and puni&s;hment of the ince&s;tuous
per&s;on. Upon the whole then we &s;ee, that
it is capable of being inferred from St. Paul's
own words, in the long extract which we
have quoted, that the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Co|rinthians
was written after St. Paul had de|termined
to po&s;tpone his journey to Corinth;
in other words, that the change of his pur|po&s;e,
with re&s;pect to the cour&s;e of his jour|ney,
though expre&s;sly mentioned only in
the &s;econd epi&s;tle, had taken place before the
writing of the fir&s;t; the point which we
made out to be implied in the hi&s;tory, by
the order of the events there recorded, and
<PB N="123" REF="125">
the allu&s;ions to tho&s;e events in the fir&s;t epi|&s;tle.
Now this is a &s;pecies of congruity of
all others the mo&s;t to be relied upon. It is
not an agreement between two accounts of
the &s;ame tran&s;action, or between different
&s;tatements of the &s;ame fact, for the fact is
not &s;tated; nothing that can be called an
account is given; but it is the junction of
two conclu&s;ions, deduced from independent
&s;ources, and deducible only by inve&s;tiga|tion
and compari&s;on.</P>
<P>This point, viz. the change of the route,
being prior to the writing of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle,
al&s;o falls in with, and accounts for, the man|ner
in which he &s;peaks in that epi&s;tle of his
journey. His fir&s;t intention had been, as he
here declares, to "pa&s;s by them into Mace|donia;"
that intention having been previ|ou&s;ly
given up, he writes, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle,
"that he would not &s;ee them now by the
way," i. e. as he mu&s;t have done upon his
fir&s;t plan; "but that he tru&s;ted to tarry
awhile with them, and po&s;&s;ibly to abide,
yea and winter with them" (1 Cor. chap.
xvi. ver. 5, 6). It al&s;o accounts for a &s;ingula|rity
in the text referred to, which mu&s;t &s;trike
<PB N="124" REF="126">
every reader: "I will come to you when I
pa&s;s through Macedonia; for I do pa&s;s
through Macedonia." The &s;upplemental
&s;entence, "for I do pa&s;s through Macedonia,"
imports that there had been &s;ome previous
communication upon the &s;ubject of the jour|ney;
and al&s;o that there had been &s;ome vacil|lation
and indeci&s;ivene&s;s in the apo&s;tle's plan;
both which we now perceive to have been
the ca&s;e. The &s;entence is as much as to &s;ay,
"this is what I at la&s;t re&s;olve upon." The
expre&s;&s;ion "<GAP DESC="foreign">," is ambi|guous;
it may denote either "when I pa&s;s,
or when I &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed, through Ma|cedonia:"
the con&s;iderations offered above
fix it to the latter &s;en&s;e. La&s;tly, the point we
have endeavoured to make out, confirms, or
rather indeed is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of a
conjecture, which forms the &s;ubject of a
number in our ob&s;ervations upon the fir&s;t
epi&s;tle, that the in&s;inuation of certain of the
church of Corinth, that he would come no
more among&s;t them, was founded in &s;ome
previous di&s;appointment of their expecta|tions.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>No. V.</HEAD>
<P>But if St. Paul had changed his purpo&s;e
before the writing of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, why
did he defer explaining him&s;elf to the Co|rinthians,
concerning the rea&s;on of that
change, until he wrote the &s;econd? This
is a very fair que&s;tion; and we are able, I
think, to return to it a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.
The real cau&s;e, and the cau&s;e at length a&s;|&s;igned
by St. Paul for po&s;tponing his vi&s;it
to Corinth, and not travelling by the route
which he had at fir&s;t de&s;igned, was the di&s;|orderly
&s;tate of the Corinthian church at the
time, and the painful &s;everities which he
&s;hould have found him&s;elf obliged to exer|ci&s;e,
if he had come among&s;t them during
the exi&s;tence of the&s;e irregularities. He
was willing therefore to try, before he came
in per&s;on, what a letter of authoritative ob|jurgation
would do among&s;t them, and to
leave time for the operation of the experi|ment.
That was his &s;cheme in writing the
fir&s;t epi&s;tle. But it was not for him to ac|quaint
them with the &s;cheme. After the
epi&s;tle had produced its effect (and to the
<PB N="126" REF="128">
utmo&s;t extent, as it &s;hould &s;eem of the apo|&s;tle's
hopes); when it had wrought in them
a deep &s;en&s;e of their fault, and an almo&s;t
pa&s;&s;ionate &s;olicitude to re&s;tore them&s;elves to
the approbation of their teacher; when Ti|tus
(chap. vii. ver. 6, 7, 11) had brought him
intelligence "of their earne&s;t de&s;ire, their
mourning, their fervent mind towards him,
of their &s;orrow and their penitence; what
carefulne&s;s, what clearing of them&s;elves,
what indignation, what fear, what ve|hement
de&s;ire, what zeal, what revenge,"
his letter, and the general concern occa|&s;ioned
by it, had excited among&s;t them;
he then opens him&s;elf fully upon the &s;ub|ject.
The affectionate mind of the apo&s;tle
is touched by this return of zeal and duty.
He tells them that he did not vi&s;it them at
the time propo&s;ed, le&s;t their meeting &s;hould
have been attended with mutual grief; and
with grief to him embittered by the reflec|tion,
that he was giving pain to tho&s;e, from
whom alone he could receive comfort: "I
determined this with my&s;elf, that I would
not come again to you in heavine&s;s; for
if I make you &s;orry, who is he that mak|eth
<PB N="127" REF="129">
me glad but the &s;ame which is made
&s;orry by me?" (chap. ii. ver. 1, 2) that
he had written his former epi&s;tle to warn
them beforehand of their fault, "le&s;t when
he came he &s;hould have &s;orrow of them
of whom he ought to rejoice" (chap. ii.
ver. 3); that he had the farther view, though
perhaps unperceived by them, of making
an experiment of their fidelity, "to know
the proof of them, whether they were obe|dient
in all things" (chap. ii. ver. 9). This
full di&s;covery of his motive came very natu|rally
from the apo&s;tle, after he had &s;een the
&s;ucce&s;s of his mea&s;ures, but would not have
been a &s;ea&s;onable communication before. The
whole compo&s;es a train of &s;entiment and of
conduct re&s;ulting from real &s;ituation, and
from real circum&s;tance, and as remote as
po&s;&s;ible from fiction or impo&s;ture.</P>

<P>Chap. xi. ver. 9. "When I was pre&s;ent

no man; for that which was lacking to
me, the brethren which came from Ma|cedonia
&s;upplied." The principal fact &s;et
<PB N="128" REF="130">
forth in this pa&s;&s;age, the arrival at Corinth
of brethren from Macedonia during St. Paul's
fir&s;t re&s;idence in that city, is explicitly re|corded,
Acts, chap. xviii. ver. 1, 5: "After
the&s;e things Paul departed from Athens,
and came to Corinth. And when Silas
and Timotheus were come from Macedo|nia,
Paul was pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit, and te&s;tified
to the Jews that Je&s;us was Chri&s;t."</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>No. VII.</HEAD>
<P>The above quotation from the Acts proves
that Silas and Timotheus were a&s;&s;i&s;ting to
St. Paul in preaching the go&s;pel at Corinth.
With which corre&s;pond the words of the
epi&s;tle (chap. i. ver. 19): "For the Son of
God, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was preached
among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus,
and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but
in him was yea." I do admit that the
corre&s;pondency, con&s;idered by it&s;elf, is too
direct and obvious; and that an impo&s;tor
with the hi&s;tory before him might, and pro|bably
would, produce agreements of the &s;ame
kind. But let it be remembered, that this
reference is found in a writing, which from
<PB N="129" REF="131">
many di&s;crepancies, and e&s;pecially from tho&s;e
noted No. II. we may conclude, was not
compo&s;ed by any one who had con&s;ulted,
and who pur&s;ued the hi&s;tory. Some ob&s;er|vation
al&s;o ari&s;es upon the variation of the
name. We read Silas in the Acts, Silvanus
in the epi&s;tle. The &s;imilitude of the&s;e two
names, if they were the names of different
per&s;ons, is greater than could ea&s;ily have
proceeded from accident; I mean that it is
not probable, that two per&s;ons placed in &s;itu|ations
&s;o much alike, &s;hould bear names &s;o
nearly re&s;embling each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That they were the &s;ame per&s;on is farther confirm|ed by 1 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver. 1, compared with Acts, chap. xvii. ver. 10.</NOTE>. On the other
hand, the difference of the name in the two
pa&s;&s;ages negatives the &s;uppo&s;ition of the
pa&s;&s;ages, or the account contained in them,
being tran&s;cribed either from the other.</P>

<P>Chap. ii. ver. 12, 13. "When I came
to Troas to preach Chri&s;t's go&s;pel, and
a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
I had no re&s;t in my &s;pirit, becau&s;e I found
not Titus, my brother; but taking my
leave of them, I went from thence into
Macedonia."</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h a conformity between this
pa&s;&s;age and the hi&s;tory, nothing more is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to be pre&s;umed, than that St. Paul
proceeded from Ephe&s;us to Macedonia, upon
the &s;ame cour&s;e by which he came back from
Macedonia to Ephe&s;us, or rather to Miletus
in the neighbourhood of Ephe&s;us; in other
words, that, in his journey to the penin&s;ula
of Greece, he went and returned the &s;ame
way. St. Paul is now in Macedonia, where
he had lately arrived from Ephe&s;us. Our
quotation imports that in his journey he had
&s;topped at Troas. Of this, the hi&s;tory &s;ays
nothing, leaving us only the &s;hort account,
"that Paul departed from Ephe&s;us, for to go
into Macedonia." But the hi&s;tory &s;ays,
that in his <HI>return</HI> from Macedonia to Ephe|&s;us,
"Paul &s;ailed from Philippi to <HI>Troas</HI>; and
that, when the di&s;ciples came together on
the fir&s;t day of the week to break bread,
Paul preached unto them all night; that
from Troas he went by land to A&s;&s;os, from
<PB N="131" REF="133">
A&s;&s;os, taking &s;hip and coa&s;ting along the
front of A&s;ia Minor, he came by Mytelene
to Miletus." Which account proves, fir&s;t,
that Troas lay in the way by which St. Paul
pa&s;&s;ed between Ephe&s;us and Macedonia;
&s;econdly, that he had di&s;ciples there. In
one journey between the&s;e two places, the
epi&s;tle, and in another journey between the
&s;ame places, the hi&s;tory makes him &s;top at
this city. Of the fir&s;t journey he is made
to &s;ay, "that a door was in that city opened
unto him of the Lord;" in the &s;econd we
find di&s;ciples there collected around him, and
the apo&s;tle exerci&s;ing his mini&s;try, with,
what was even in him, more than ordinary
zeal and labour. The epi&s;tle therefore is in
this in&s;tance confirmed, if not by the terms,
at lea&s;t by the probability of the hi&s;tory; a
&s;pecies of con&s;irmation by no means to be
de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e, as far as it reaches, it is
evidently uncontrived.</P>
<P>Grotius, I know, refers the arrival at
Troas, to which the epi&s;tle alludes, to a dif|ferent
period, but I think very improbably;
for nothing appears to me more certain, than
that the meeting with Titus, which St. Paul
<PB N="132" REF="134">
expected at Troas, was the &s;ame meeting
which took place in Macedonia, viz. upon
Titus's coming out of Greece. In the quo|tation
before us, he tells the Corinthians,
"When I came to Troas, I had no re&s;t in
my &s;pirit, becau&s;e I found not Titus, my
brother; but, taking my leave of them, I
went from thence into Macedonia." Then
in the &s;eventh chapter he writes, "When
we were come into Macedonia our fle&s;h
had no re&s;t, but we were troubled on every
&s;ide; without were fightings, within were
fears; neverthele&s;s God, that comforteth
them that are ca&s;t down, comforted us by
the coming of Titus." The&s;e two pa&s;|&s;ages
plainly relate to the &s;ame journey of
Titus, in meeting with whom St. Paul had
been di&s;appointed at Troas, and rejoiced in
Macedonia. And among&s;t other rea&s;ons
which fix the former pa&s;&s;age to the coming
of Titus out of Greece, is the con&s;ideration,
that it was nothing to the Corinthians that
St. Paul did not meet with Titus at Troas,
were it not that he was to bring intelligence
from Corinth. The mention of the di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="133" REF="135">
in this place, upon any other
&s;uppo&s;ition, is irrelative.</P>

<P>Chap. xi. ver. 24, 25. "Of the Jews
five times received I forty &s;tripes &s;ave one;
thrice was I beaten with rods; once was
I &s;toned; thrice I &s;uffered &s;hipwreck; a
night and a day I have been in the deep."</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars cannot be extracted out
of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles; which proves,
as hath been already ob&s;erved, that the epi|&s;tle
was not framed from the hi&s;tory; yet
they are con&s;i&s;tent with it, which, con&s;ider|ing
how numerically circum&s;tantial the ac|count
is, is more than could happen to arbi|trary
and independent fictions. When I
&s;ay that the&s;e particulars are <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with
the hi&s;tory, I mean, fir&s;t, that there is no
article in the enumeration which is contra|dicted
by the hi&s;tory; &s;econdly, that the
hi&s;tory, though &s;ilent with re&s;pect to many
of the facts here enumerated, has left &s;pace
for the exi&s;tence of the&s;e facts, con&s;i&s;tent
with the &s;idelity of its own narration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, no contradiction is di&s;coverable be|tween
<PB N="134" REF="136">
the epi&s;tle and the hi&s;tory. When
St. Paul &s;ays, <HI>thrice</HI> was I beaten with rods,
although the hi&s;tory record only <HI>one</HI> beating
with rods, viz. at Philippi, Acts, chap. xvi.
ver. 22, yet is there no contradiction. It
is only the omi&s;&s;ion in one book of what is
related in another. But had the hi&s;tory
contained accounts of <HI>four</HI> beatings with rods,
at the time of writing this epi&s;tle, in which
St. Paul &s;ays that he had only &s;uffered <HI>three,</HI>
there would have been a contradiction pro|perly
&s;o called. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation ap|plies
generally to the other parts of the
enumeration, concerning which the hi&s;tory
is &s;ilent: but there is one clau&s;e in the quo|tation
particularly de&s;erving of remark; be|cau&s;e,
when confronted with the hi&s;tory, it
furni&s;hes the neare&s;t approach to a contra|diction,
without a contradiction being ac|tually
incurred, of any I remember to have
met with. "Once," &s;aith St. Paul, "was
I &s;toned." Does the hi&s;tory relate that
St. Paul, prior to the writing of this epi&s;tle,
had been &s;toned more than once? The
hi&s;tory mentions di&s;tinctly one occa&s;ion up|on
which St. Paul was &s;toned, viz. at Ly&s;|tra
<PB N="135" REF="137">
in Lycaonia. "Then came thither cer|tain
Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
per&s;uaded the people; and, having &s;toned
Paul, drew him out of the city, &s;uppo&s;ing
he had been dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). And
it mentions al&s;o another occa&s;ion in which
"an a&s;&s;ault was made both of the Gentiles,
and al&s;o of the Jews with their rulers, to
u&s;e them de&s;pitefully, and to &s;tone them;
but they were aware of it," the hi&s;tory
proceeds to tell us, "and fled into Ly&s;tra
and Derbe." This happened at Iconium,
prior to the date of the epi&s;tle. Now had
the a&s;&s;ault been completed; had the hi&s;tory
related that a &s;tone was thrown, as it relates
that preparations were made both by Jews
and Gentiles to &s;tone Paul and his com|panions;
or even had the account of this
tran&s;action &s;topped, without going on to
inform us that Paul and his companions
were "aware of their danger and &s;led," a
contradiction between the hi&s;tory and the
epi&s;tle would have en&s;ued Truth is nece&s;|&s;arily
con&s;i&s;tent; but it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible
that independent accounts, not having truth
to guide them, &s;hould thus advance to the
<PB N="136" REF="138">
very brink of contradiction without falling
into it.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;ay, that if the Acts of the Apo|&s;tles
be &s;ilent concerning many of the in&s;tances
enumerated in the epi&s;tle, this &s;ilence may
be accounted for, from the plan and fabric
of the hi&s;tory. The date of the epi&s;tle &s;yn|chroni&s;es
with the beginning of the twentieth
chapter of the Acts. The part, therefore, of
the hi&s;tory, which precedes the twentieth
chapter, is the only part in which can be
found any notice of the per&s;ecutions to
which St. Paul refers. Now it does not ap|pear
that the author of the hi&s;tory was with
St. Paul until his departure from Troas, on
his way to Macedonia, as related chap. xvi.
ver. 10; or rather indeed the contrary ap|pears.
It is in this point of the hi&s;tory that
the language changes. In the &s;eventh and
eighth ver&s;es of this chapter the third per&s;on
is u&s;ed. "After <HI>they</HI> were come to My&s;ia,
<HI>they</HI> a&s;&s;ayed to go into Bithynia, but the
&s;pirit &s;uffered them not; and <HI>they</HI> pa&s;&s;ing
by My&s;ia, came to Troas:" and the third
per&s;on is in like manner con&s;tantly u&s;ed
throughout the foregoing part of the hi&s;tory.
<PB N="137" REF="139">
In the tenth ver&s;e of this chapter, the fir&s;t
per&s;on comes in: "After Paul had &s;een the
vi&s;ion, immediately <HI>we</HI> endeavoured to go
into Macedonia; a&s;&s;uredly gathering that
the Lord had called <HI>us</HI> to preach the go&s;|pel
unto them." Now, from this time to
the writing of the epi&s;tle, the hi&s;tory occu|pies
four chapters: yet it is in the&s;e, if in
any, that a regular or continued account of
the apo&s;tle's life is to be expected; for how
&s;uccinctly his hi&s;tory is delivered in the
preceding part of the book, that is to &s;ay,
from the time of his conver&s;ion to the time
when the hi&s;torian joined him at Troas, ex|cept
the particulars of his conver&s;ion it|&s;elf
which are related circum&s;tantially, may
be under&s;tood from the following ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a period of &s;ixteen years
is compri&s;ed in le&s;s than three chapters;
and of the&s;e, a material part is taken up with
di&s;cour&s;es. After his conver&s;ion, he conti|nued
in the neighbourhood of Dama&s;cus,
according to the hi&s;tory, for a certain con|&s;iderable,
though indefinite length of time,
according to his own words (Gal. ch. i. ver. 18),
<PB N="138" REF="140">
for three years; of which no other account
is given than this &s;hort one, that "&s;traight|way
he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;ynagogues,
that he is the Son of God; that all that heard
him were amazed, and &s;aid, Is not this he
that de&s;troyed them which called on his
name in Jeru&s;alem? that he increa&s;ed the
more in &s;trength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Dama&s;cus; and that, after
many days were fulfilled, the Jews took coun|&s;el
to kill him." From Dama&s;cus he pro|ceeded
to Jeru&s;alem; and of his re&s;idence
there nothing more particular is recorded,
than that "he was with the apo&s;tles, coming
in and going out; that he &s;pake boldly in
the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and di&s;puted
again&s;t the Grecians who went about to
kill him." From Jeru&s;alem, the hi&s;tory
&s;ends him to his native city of Tar&s;us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, chap. ix. ver. 30.</NOTE>.
It &s;eems probable, from the order and di&s;|po&s;ition
of the hi&s;tory, that St. Paul's &s;tay
at Tar&s;us was of &s;ome continuance; for we
hear nothing more of him, until, after a long
apparent interval, and much interjacent nar|rative,
<PB N="139" REF="141">
Barnabas, de&s;irous of Paul's a&s;&s;i&s;tance
upon the enlargement of the Chri&s;tian mi&s;|&s;ion,
"went to Tar&s;us for to &s;eek him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. ver. 25.</NOTE>."
We cannot doubt but that the new apo&s;tle
had been bu&s;ied in his mini&s;try; yet of
what he did, or what he &s;uffered, during
this period, which may include three or four
years, the hi&s;tory profe&s;&s;es not to deliver
any information. As Tar&s;us was &s;ituated
upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, and as, though Tar&s;us was
his home, yet it is probable he vi&s;ited from
thence many other places, for the purpo&s;e
of preaching the Go&s;pel, it is not unlikely,
that in the cour&s;e of three or four years,
he might undertake many &s;hort voyages to
neighbouring countries, in the navigating of
which we may be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e that
&s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters and &s;hipwrecks befel
him, to which he refers in the quotation
before us, "thrice I &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, a
night and a day I have been in the deep."
This la&s;t clau&s;e I am inclined to interpret of
his being obliged to take to an open boat,
upon the lo&s;s of the &s;hip, and his continuing
<PB N="140" REF="142">
out at &s;ea in that dangerous &s;ituation, a
night and a day. St. Paul is here recounting
his &s;ufferings, not relating miracles. From
Tar&s;us, Barnabas brought Paul to Antioch,
and there he remained a year; but of the
tran&s;actions of that year no other de&s;cription
is given than what is contained in the four
la&s;t ver&s;es of the eleventh chapter. After a
more &s;olemn dedication to the mini&s;try,
Barnabas and Paul proceeded from Antioch
to Cilicia, and from thence they &s;ailed to
Cyprus, of which voyage no particulars are
mentioned. Upon their return from Cyprus,
they made a progre&s;s together through the
Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia; and though two remarkable
&s;peeches be pre&s;erved, and a few incidents
in the cour&s;e of their travels circum&s;tan|tially
related, yet is the account of this
progre&s;s, upon the whole, given profe&s;|&s;edly
with conci&s;ene&s;s: for in&s;tance, at Ico|nium
it is &s;aid that they abode a long
time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiv. ver. 3.</NOTE>; yet of this long abode, except con|cerning
the manner in which they were
driven away, no memoir is in&s;erted in the
<PB N="141" REF="143">
hi&s;tory. The whole is wrapped up in one
&s;hort &s;ummary, "they &s;pake boldly in the
Lord, which gave te&s;timony unto the word
of his grace, and granted &s;igns and won|ders
to be done by their hands." Having
completed their progre&s;s, the two apo&s;tles
returned to Antioch, "and there they abode
long time with the di&s;ciples." Here we
have another large portion of time pa&s;&s;ed
over in &s;ilence. To this &s;ucceeded a journey
to Jeru&s;alem, upon a di&s;pute which then
much agitated the Chri&s;tian church, concern|ing
the obligation of the law of Mo&s;es.
When the object of that journey was com|pleted,
Paul propo&s;ed to Barnabas to go
again and vi&s;it their brethren in every city
where they had preached the word of the
Lord. The execution of this plan carried
our apo&s;tle through Syria, Cilicia, and many
provinces of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia; yet is the ac|count
of the whole journey di&s;patched, in
four ver&s;es of the &s;ixteenth chapter.</P>
<P>If the Acts of the Apo&s;tles had under|taken
to exhibit regular annals of St. Paul's
mini&s;try, or even any continued account of
his life, from his conver&s;ion at Dama&s;cus
<PB N="142" REF="144">
to his impri&s;onment at Rome, I &s;hould have
thought the omi&s;&s;ion of the circum&s;tances
referred to in our epi&s;tle, a matter of rea|&s;onable
objection. But when it appears,
from the hi&s;tory it&s;elf, that large portions
of St. Paul's life were either pa&s;&s;ed over in
&s;ilence, or only &s;lightly touched upon, and
that nothing more than certain detached in|cidents
and di&s;cour&s;es are related; when we
ob&s;erve al&s;o, that the author of the hi&s;tory
did not join our apo&s;tle's &s;ociety till a few
years before the writing of the epi&s;tle, at
lea&s;t that there is no proof in the hi&s;tory
that he did &s;o; in comparing the hi&s;tory
with the epi&s;tle, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed by
the di&s;covery of omi&s;&s;ions; we &s;hall a&s;cribe
it to truth that there is no contradiction.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 1. "Do we begin again
to commend our&s;elves; or need we, as
&s;ome others, epi&s;tles of commendation to
you?"</P>
<P>"As &s;ome others." Turn to Acts xviii. 27,
and you will find that, a &s;hort time before
the writing of this epi&s;tle, Apollos had gone
<PB N="143" REF="145">
to Corinth with letters of commendations
from the Ephe&s;ian Chri&s;tians; "and when
Apollos was di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s into Achaia,
the brethren wrote, exhorting the di&s;ciples
to receive him." Here the words of the
epi&s;tle bear the appearance of alluding to
&s;ome &s;pecific in&s;tance, and the hi&s;tory &s;upplies
that in&s;tance; it &s;upplies at lea&s;t an in&s;tance
as oppo&s;ite as po&s;&s;ible to the terms which the
apo&s;tle u&s;es, and to the date and direction
of the epi&s;tle, in which they are found. The
letter which Apollos carried from Ephe&s;us,
was preci&s;ely the letter of commendation
which St. Paul meant; and it was to Achaia
of which Corinth was the capital, and indeed
to Corinth it&s;elf (Acts, chap. xix. ver. 1),
that Apollos carried it; and it was about
two years before the writing of this epi&s;tle.
If St. Paul's words be rather thought to refer
to &s;ome general u&s;age which then obtained
among Chri&s;tian churches, the ca&s;e of Apol|los
exempli&s;ies that u&s;age; and affords that
&s;pecies of confirmation to the epi&s;tle, which
ari&s;es from &s;eeing the manners of the age,
in which it purports to be written, faithfully

<P>Chap. xiii. ver. 1. "This is the third
time I am coming to you" (<GAP DESC="foreign">).</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e words import that the writer
had been at Corinth twice before? yet, if
they import this, they over&s;et every con|gruity
we have been endeavouring to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.
The Acts of the Apo&s;tles record only
two journeys of St. Paul to Corinth. We
have all along &s;uppo&s;ed, what every mark
of time except this expre&s;&s;ion indicates, that
the epi&s;tle was written between the fir&s;t and
&s;econd of the&s;e journeys. If St. Paul had
been already twice at Corinth, this &s;uppo&s;i|tion
mu&s;t be given up; and every argument
or ob&s;ervation which depends upon it, falls
to the ground. Again, the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles not only record no more than two
journeys of St. Paul to Corinth, but do not
allow us to &s;uppo&s;e that more than two &s;uch
journeys could be made or intended by him
within the period which the hi&s;tory com|pri&s;es;
for, from his fir&s;t journey into
Greece to his fir&s;t impri&s;onment at Rome,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
with which the hi&s;tory concludes, the apo|&s;tle's
time is accounted for. If therefore the
epi&s;tle was written after the &s;econd journey
to Corinth, and upon the view and expecta|tion
of a third, it mu&s;t have been written
after his fir&s;t impri&s;onment at Rome, <HI>i. e.</HI>
after the time to which the hi&s;tory extends.
When I fir&s;t read over this epi&s;tle with the
particular view of comparing it with the
hi&s;tory, which I cho&s;e to do without con|&s;ulting
any commentary whatever, I own
that I felt my&s;elf confounded by this text.
It appeared to contradict the opinion, which
I had been led by a great variety of cir|cum&s;tances
to form, concerning the date and
occa&s;ion of the epi&s;tle. At length however
it occurred to my thoughts to enquire, whe|ther
the pa&s;&s;age did nece&s;&s;arily imply that
St. Paul had been at Corinth twice; or
whether, when he &s;ays "this is the third
time I am coming to you," he might mean
only that this was the third time that he
was ready, that he was prepared, that he
intended to &s;et out upon his journey to
Corinth. I recollected that he had once
before this purpo&s;ed to vi&s;it Corinth, and
<PB N="146" REF="148">
had been di&s;appointed in his purpo&s;e; which
di&s;appointment forms the &s;ubject of much
apology and prote&s;tation, in the fir&s;t and
&s;econd chapters of the epi&s;tle. Now, if the
journey in which he had been di&s;appointed
was reckoned by him one of the times in
which "he was coming to them," then the
pre&s;ent would be the third time, <HI>i. e.</HI> of
his being ready and prepared to come; al|though
he had been actually at Corinth only
<HI>once</HI> before. This conjecture being taken
up, a farther examination of the pa&s;&s;age and
the epi&s;tle, produced proofs which placed it
beyond doubt. "This is the third time I
am coming to you:" in the ver&s;e following
the&s;e words he adds, "I told you before,
and foretel you, as if I were pre&s;ent <HI>the
&s;econd time</HI>; and being ab&s;ent, now I write
to them which heretofore have &s;inned,
and to all other, that if I come again, I
will not &s;pare." In this ver&s;e, the apo&s;tle
is declaring beforehand what he would do
in his intended vi&s;it: His expre&s;&s;ion there|fore,
"as if I were pre&s;ent the &s;econd time,"
relates to that vi&s;it. But, if his future vi&s;it
would only make him pre&s;ent among&s;t them
<PB N="147" REF="149">
a &s;econd time, it follows that he had been al|ready
there but once. Again, in the fifteenth
ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, he tells them,
"In this confidence, I was minded to come
unto you before, that you might have a
<HI>&s;econd</HI> benefit." Why a &s;econd, and not a
third benefit? why <GAP DESC="foreign">, and not <GAP DESC="foreign">,
if the <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the fifteenth
chapter, meant a <HI>third</HI> vi&s;it? for, though
the vi&s;it in the fir&s;t chapter be that vi&s;it in
which he was di&s;appointed, yet, as it is
evident from the epi&s;tle that he had never
been at Corinth, from the time of the di&s;|appointment
to the time of writing the
epi&s;tle, it follows, that if it was only a &s;econd
vi&s;it in which he was di&s;appointed then, it
could only be a &s;econd vi&s;it which he pro|po&s;ed
now. But the text which I think
is deci&s;ive of the que&s;tion, if any que&s;tion
remain upon the &s;ubject, is the fourteenth
ver&s;e of the twelfth chapter: "Behold the
third time I am ready to come to you"
(<GAP DESC="foreign">). It is very
clear that the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the
twelfth chapter, and the <GAP DESC="foreign">
of the thirteenth chapter, are equivalent ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
were intended to convey the &s;ame
meaning, and to relate to the &s;ame journey.
The compari&s;on of the&s;e phra&s;es gives us
St. Paul's own explanation of his own
words; and it is that very explanation which
we are contending for, viz. that <GAP DESC="foreign">
does not mean that he was coming
a third time, but that this was the third time
he was in readine&s;s to come, <GAP DESC="foreign">.
I do not apprehend, that after this
it can be nece&s;&s;ary to call to our aid the
reading of the Alexandrian manu&s;cript,
which gives <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the thir|teenth
chapter as well as in the twelfth; or
of the Syriac and Coptic ver&s;ions, which
follow that reading; becau&s;e I allow that
this reading, be&s;ides not being &s;ufficiently
&s;upported by ancient copies, is probably
paraphra&s;tical, and has been in&s;erted for the
purpo&s;e of expre&s;&s;ing more unequivocally
the &s;en&s;e, which the &s;horter expre&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="foreign">
was &s;uppo&s;ed to carry. Upon
the whole, the matter is &s;ufficiently certain;
nor do I propo&s;e it as a new interpretation
of the text which contains the difficulty,
for the &s;ame was given by Grotius long
<PB N="149" REF="151">
ago; but I thought it the cleare&s;t way of
explaining the &s;ubject, to de&s;cribe the man|ner
in which the difficulty, the &s;olution,
and the proofs of that &s;olution, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly
pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my enquiries.
Now, in hi&s;torical re&s;earches, a reconciled
incon&s;i&s;tency becomes a po&s;itive argument.
Fir&s;t, becau&s;e an impo&s;tor generally guards
again&s;t the appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency; and
&s;econdly, becau&s;e, when apparent incon|&s;i&s;tencies
are found, it is &s;eldom that any
thing but truth renders them capable of re|conciliation.
The exi&s;tence of the difficulty
proves the want or ab&s;ence of that caution,
which u&s;ually accompanies the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of fraud; and the &s;olution proves, that it is
not the colli&s;ion of fortuitous propo&s;itions
which we have to deal with, but that a thread
of truth winds through the whole, which
pre&s;erves every circum&s;tance in its place.</P>

Now, how is St. Paul's fir&s;t journey into
Europe, which was the only one he had
taken before the writing of the epi&s;tle,
traced out in the hi&s;tory? Sailing from A&s;ia,
he landed at Philippi; from Philippi, tra|ver&s;ing
the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula,
he pa&s;&s;ed through Amphipolis and Apollonia
to The&s;&s;alonica; from thence through Berea
<PB N="151" REF="153">
to Athens, and from Athens to Corinth,
<HI>where he &s;topped</HI>; and from whence, after a
re&s;idence of a year and a half, he &s;ailed back
into Syria. So that Corinth was the la&s;t
place which he vi&s;ited in the penin&s;ula; was
the place from which he returned into A&s;ia;
and was, as &s;uch, the boundary and limit of
his progre&s;s. He could not have &s;aid the
&s;ame thing, viz. "I hope hereafter to vi&s;it
the regions beyond you," in an epi&s;tle to
the Philippians, or in an epi&s;tle to the The&s;|&s;alonians,
ina&s;much as he mu&s;t be deemed
to have already vi&s;ited the regions beyond
<HI>them,</HI> having proceeded from tho&s;e cities to
other parts of Greece. But from Corinth
he returned home; every part therefore,
beyond that city, might properly be &s;aid,
as it is &s;aid in the pa&s;&s;age before us, to
be unvi&s;ited. Yet is this propriety, the
&s;pontaneous effect of truth, and produced
without meditation or de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE argument of this epi&s;tle in &s;ome
mea&s;ure proves its antiquity. It
will hardly be doubted, but that it was writ|ten
whil&s;t the di&s;pute concerning the cir|cumci&s;ion
of Gentile converts was fre&s;h in
men's minds; for, even &s;uppo&s;ing it to have
been a forgery, the only credible motive that
can be a&s;&s;igned for the forgery, was to bring
the name and authority of the apo&s;tle into
this controver&s;y. No de&s;ign could be &s;o
in&s;ipid, or &s;o unlikely to enter into the
thoughts of any man, as to produce an
epi&s;tle written earne&s;tly and pointedly upon
one &s;ide of a controver&s;y, when the contro|ver&s;y
it&s;elf was dead, and the que&s;tion no
longer intere&s;ting to any de&s;cription of read|ers
whatever. Now the controver&s;y con|cerning
the circumci&s;ion of the Gentile
<PB N="153" REF="155">
Chri&s;tians was of &s;uch a nature, that, if it
aro&s;e at all, it mu&s;t have ari&s;en in the begin|ning
of Chri&s;tianity. As Judaea was the
&s;cene of the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory; as the author
and preachers of Chri&s;tianity were Jews; as
the religion it&s;elf acknowledged and was
founded upon the Jewi&s;h religion, in contra|di&s;tinction
to every other religion then pro|fe&s;&s;ed
among&s;t mankind; it was not to be
wondered at, that &s;ome of its teachers &s;hould
carry it out in the world rather as a &s;ect and
modification of Judai&s;m, than as a &s;eparate,
original revelation; or that they &s;hould invite
their pro&s;elytes to tho&s;e ob&s;ervances, in which
they lived them&s;elves. This was likely to
happen: but if it did not happen <HI>at fir&s;t</HI>; if,
whil&s;t the religion was in the hands of Jewi&s;h
teachers, no &s;uch claim was advanced, no
&s;uch condition was attempted to be impo&s;ed;
it is not probable that the doctrine would
be &s;tarted, much le&s;s that it &s;hould prevail
in any future period. I likewi&s;e think, that
tho&s;e preten&s;ions of Judai&s;m were much
more likely to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, whil&s;t the
Jews continued a nation, than after their
fall and di&s;per&s;ion; whil&s;t Jeru&s;alem and
<PB N="154" REF="156">
the temple &s;tood, than after the de&s;truction
brought upon them by the Roman arms,
the fatal ce&s;&s;ation of the &s;acrifice and the
prie&s;thood, the humiliating lo&s;s of their
country, and, with it, of the great rites and
&s;ymbols of their in&s;titution. It &s;hould &s;eem
therefore, from the nature of the &s;ubject,
and the &s;ituation of the parties, that this
controver&s;y was carried on in the interval
between the preaching of Chri&s;tianity to the
Gentiles, and the inva&s;ion of Titus; and that
our pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, which was undoubtedly
intended to bear a part in this controver&s;y,
mu&s;t be referred to the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>But, again, the epi&s;tle &s;uppo&s;es that cer|tain
de&s;igning adherents of the Jewi&s;h law had
crept into the churches of Galatia; and had
been endeavouring, and but too &s;ucce&s;sfully,
to per&s;uade the Galatic converts, that they
had been taught the new religion imperfectly
and at &s;econd hand; that the founder of
their church him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only an infe|rior
and deputed commi&s;&s;ion, the &s;eat of
truth and authority being in the apo&s;tles
and elders of Jeru&s;alem; moreover, that
whatever he might profe&s;s among&s;t them,
<PB N="155" REF="157">
he had him&s;elf at other times, and in other
places, given way to the doctrine of cir|cumci&s;ion.&mdash;The
epi&s;tle is unintelligible
without &s;uppo&s;ing all this. Referring there|fore
to this, as to what had actually pa&s;&s;ed,
we find St. Paul treating &s;o unju&s;t an at|tempt
to undermine his credit, and to intro|duce
among&s;t his converts a doctrine which
he had uniformly reprobated, in terms of
great a&s;perity and indignation. And in or|der
to refute the &s;u&s;picions which had been
rai&s;ed concerning the fidelity of his teach|ing,
as well as to a&s;&s;ert the independency
and divine original of his mi&s;&s;ion, we find
him appealing to the hi&s;tory of his conver|&s;ion,
to his conduct under it, to the man|ner
in which he had conferred with the apo|&s;tles
when he met with them at Jeru&s;alem;
alledging, that &s;o far was his doctrine from
being derived from them, or they from ex|erci&s;ing
any &s;uperiority over him, that they
had &s;imply a&s;&s;ented to what he had already
preached among&s;t the Gentiles, and which
preaching was communicated not by them
to him, but by him&s;elf to them; that he
had maintained the liberty of the Gentile
<PB N="156" REF="158">
church, by oppo&s;ing, upon one occa&s;ion, an
apo&s;tle to the face, when the timidity of
his behaviour &s;eemed to endanger it; that
from the fir&s;t, that all along, that to that
hour, he had con&s;tantly re&s;i&s;ted the claims
of Judai&s;m; and that the per&s;ecutions which
he daily underwent, at the hands or by the
in&s;tigation of the Jews, and of which he
bore in his per&s;on the marks and &s;cars, might
have been avoided by him, if he had con|&s;ented
to employ his labours in bringing,
through the medium of chri&s;tianity, converts
over to the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution, for then
"would the offence of the cro&s;s have cea&s;ed."
Now an impo&s;tor who had forged the epi|&s;tle
for the purpo&s;e of producing St. Paul's
authority in the di&s;pute, which, as hath been
ob&s;erved, is the only credible motive that
can be a&s;&s;igned for the forgery, might have
made the apo&s;tle deliver his opinion upon
the &s;ubject, in &s;trong and deci&s;ive terms, or
might have put his name to a train of rea|&s;oning
and argumentation upon that &s;ide of
the que&s;tion, which the impo&s;ture was in|tended
to recommend. I can allow the po&s;|&s;ibility
of &s;uch a &s;cheme as that. But for a
<PB N="157" REF="159">
writer, with this purpo&s;e in view, to feign a
&s;eries of tran&s;actions &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed
among&s;t the Chri&s;tians of Galatia, and then
to counterfeit expre&s;&s;ions of anger and re|&s;entment
excited by the&s;e tran&s;actions; to
make the apo&s;tle travel back into his own
hi&s;tory, and into a recital of various pa&s;&s;ages
of his life, &s;ome indeed directly, but others
obliquely, and others even ob&s;curely bearing
upon the point in que&s;tion; in a word, to
&s;ub&s;titute narrative for argument, expo&s;tu|lation
and complaint for dogmatic po&s;itions
and controver&s;ial rea&s;oning, in a writing pro|perly
controver&s;ial, and of which the aim
and de&s;ign was to &s;upport one &s;ide of a much
agitated que&s;tion&mdash;is a method &s;o intricate,
and &s;o unlike the methods pur&s;ued by all
other impo&s;tors, as to require very flagrant

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>In this number I &s;hall endeavour to
prove,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, and
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, were written with|out
any communication with each other.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="158" REF="160">
2. That the epi&s;tle, though written with|out
any communication with the hi&s;tory, by
recital, implication, or reference, bears te&s;ti|mony
to many of the facts contained in it.</P>
<P>I. The epi&s;tle and the Acts of the Apo|&s;tles
were written without any communica|tion
with each other.</P>
<P>To judge of this point, we mu&s;t examine
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in each, which de&s;cribe the
&s;ame tran&s;action; for if the author of ei|ther
writing derived his information from the
account which he had &s;een in the other,
when he came to &s;peak of the &s;ame tran&s;ac|tion,
he would follow that account. The
hi&s;tory of St. Paul, at Dama&s;cus, as read
in the Acts, and as referred to by the epi|&s;tle,
forms an in&s;tance of this &s;ort. Ac|cording
to the Acts, Paul (after his conver|&s;ion)
was certain days with the "di&s;ciples
which were at Dama&s;cus; and &s;traight-way
he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;ynagogues,
that he is the &s;on of God. But all that
heard him were amazed, and &s;aid, is not
this he which de&s;troyed them which called
on this name in Jeru&s;alem, and came hi|ther
for that intent, that he might bring
<PB N="159" REF="161">
them bound unto the chief prie&s;ts? But
Saul increa&s;ed the more in &s;trength, con|founding
the Jews which were at Dama&s;|cus,
proving that this is the very Chri&s;t.
And after many days were fulfilled, the
Jews took coun&s;el to kill him; but their
laying in wait was known of Saul, and they
watched the gates day and night to kill him;
then the di&s;ciples took him by night, and
let him down by the wall in a ba&s;ket; and
when Saul was come to Jeru&s;alem, he a&s;|&s;ayed
to join him&s;elf to the di&s;ciples."
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 19-26.</P>
<P>According to the epi&s;tle, "when it plea&s;ed
God, who &s;eparated me from my mother's
womb, and called me by his grace, to re|veal
his own &s;on in me, that I might preach
him among the heathen, immediately I
conferred not with fle&s;h and blood, neither
went I up to Jeru&s;alem to them which
were apo&s;tles before me: but I went into
Arabia, and returned again to Dama&s;cus;
then, after three years, I went up to Je|ru&s;alem."</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the difference ob&s;ervable in the
terms and general complexion of the&s;e two
<PB N="160" REF="162">
accounts, "the journey into Arabia," men|tioned
in the epi&s;tle, and omitted in the hi&s;|tory,
affords full proof that there exi&s;ted no
corre&s;pondence between the&s;e writers. If
the narrative in the Acts had been made up
from the epi&s;tle, it is impo&s;&s;ible that this
journey &s;hould have been pa&s;&s;ed over in
&s;ilence; if the epi&s;tle had been compo&s;ed
out of what the author had read of St. Paul's
hi&s;tory in the Acts, it is unaccountable that
it &s;hould have been in&s;erted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B. The Acts of the Apo&s;tles &s;imply inform us that St. Paul left Dama&s;cus in order to go to Jeru&s;alem, "after many days were fulfilled." If any one doubt whether the words "many days" could be intended to expre&s;s a period which included a term of three years, he will find a complete in&s;tance of the &s;ame phra&s;e u&s;ed with the &s;ame latitude in the fir&s;t book of Kings, chap. xi. ver. 38, 39: "And Shimei dwelt at Jeru&s;alem <HI>many days</HI>; and it came to pa&s;s, at the end of <HI>three years,</HI> that two of the &s;ervants of Shimei ran away."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The journey to Jeru&s;alem related in the &s;e|cond
chapter of the epi&s;tle ("then, fourteen
years after, I went up again to Jeru&s;alem") &s;up|plies
another example of the &s;ame kind. Either
this was the journey de&s;cribed in the fifteenth
chapter of the Acts, when Paul and Barna|bas
<PB N="161" REF="163">
were &s;ent from Antioch to Jeru&s;alem,
to con&s;ult the apo&s;tles and elders upon the
que&s;tion of the Gentile converts; or it was
&s;ome journey of which the hi&s;tory does not
take notice. If the fir&s;t opinion be followed,
the di&s;crepancy in the two accounts is &s;o
con&s;iderable, that it is not without difficulty
they can be adapted to the &s;ame tran&s;action:
&s;o that, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, there is no
place for &s;u&s;pecting that the writers were
guided or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by each other. If the lat|ter
opinion be preferred, we have then a
journey to Jeru&s;alem, and a conference with
the principal members of the church there,
circum&s;tantially related in the epi&s;tle, and
entirely omitted in the Acts: and we are
at liberty to repeat the ob&s;ervation, which
we before made, that the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;o ma|terial
a fact in the hi&s;tory is inexplicable, if
the hi&s;torian had read the epi&s;tle; and that
the in&s;ertion of it in the epi&s;tle, if the wri|ter
derived his information from the hi&s;tory,
is not le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>St. Peter's vi&s;it to Antioch, during which
the di&s;pute aro&s;e between him and St. Paul,
is not mentioned in the Acts.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164">
If we connect, with the&s;e in&s;tances, the
general ob&s;ervation, that no &s;crutiny can di&s;|cover
the &s;malle&s;t trace of tran&s;cription or
imitation either in things or words, we &s;hall
be fully &s;atisfied in this part of our ca&s;e;
namely, that the two records, be the facts
contained in them true or fal&s;e, come to our
hands from independent &s;ources.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;ay that the epi&s;tle, thus
proved to have been written without any
communication with the hi&s;tory, bears te&s;|timony
to a great variety of particulars con|tained
in the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="1">1. St. Paul in the early part of his life had
addicted him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Jewi&s;h
religion, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his zeal
for the in&s;titution and for the traditions
which had been incorporated with it. Up|on
this part of his character the hi&s;tory
makes St. Paul &s;peak thus: "I am verily a
man which am a Jew, born in Tar&s;us, a
city of Cilicia, yet brought up in this city
at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught accord|ing
to the perfect manner of the law of
the fathers; and was zealous towards God,
<PB N="163" REF="165">
as ye all are this day." Acts, chap. xxii.
ver. 3.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tle as follows: "I profited in
the Jews religion above many my equals
in mine own nation, being more exceed|ingly
zealous of the traditions of my fa|thers."
Chap. i. ver. 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. St. Paul, before his conver&s;ion, had
been a fierce per&s;ecutor of the new &s;ect.
"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church;
entering into every hou&s;e, and haling
men and women, committed them to pri|&s;on."
Acts, chap. vii. ver. 3.</P>
<P>This is the hi&s;tory of St. Paul, as deliver|ed
in the Acts; in the recital of his own
hi&s;tory in the epi&s;tle, "Ye have heard,"
&s;ays he, "of my conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t
in the Jews religion, how that beyond
mea&s;ure I per&s;ecuted the church of God."
Chap. i. ver. 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. St. Paul was miraculou&s;ly converted on
his way to Dama&s;cus. "And as he jour|neyed
he came near to Dama&s;cus: and &s;ud|denly
there &s;hined round about him a light
from heaven; and he fell to the earth, and
heard a voice &s;aying unto him, Saul, Saul,
<PB N="164" REF="166">
why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? And he &s;aid,
Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord &s;aid,
I am Je&s;us, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t: it is
hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks.
And he, trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid,
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 3-6. With this com|pare
the epi&s;tle, chap. i. ver. 15-17:
"When it plea&s;ed God, who &s;eparated me
from my mother's womb, and called me
by his grace to reveal his &s;on in me, that
I might preach him among the heathen;
immediately I conferred not with fle&s;h
and blood, neither went I up to Jeru&s;a|lem,
to them that were apo&s;tles before
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned
again unto Dama&s;cus."</P>
<P>In this quotation from the epi&s;tle, I de&s;ire
it to be remarked how incidentally it appears,
that the affair pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> In what
may be called the direct part of the account,
no mention is made of the place of his con|ver&s;ion
at all; a ca&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion at the
end, and an expre&s;&s;ion brought in for a dif|ferent
purpo&s;e, alone fixes it to have been
at Dama&s;cus: "I returned again to Dama&s;|cus."
<PB N="165" REF="167">
Nothing can be more like &s;implicity
and unde&s;ignedne&s;s than this is. It al&s;o draws
the agreement between the two quotations
&s;omewhat clo&s;er, to ob&s;erve that they both
&s;tate St. Paul to have preached the go&s;pel
immediately upon his call: "And &s;traight|way
he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;ynagogues,
that he is the &s;on of God." Acts, chap. ix.
ver. 20. "When it plea&s;ed God to reveal
his &s;on in me, that I might preach him
among the heathen, immediately I con|ferred
not with fle&s;h and blood." Gal.
chap. i. ver. 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. The cour&s;e of the apo&s;tle's travels after
his conver&s;ion was this:&mdash;He went from Da|ma&s;cus
to Jeru&s;alem, and from Jeru&s;alem
into Syria and Cilicia. "At Dama&s;cus the
di&s;ciples took him by night, and let him
down by the wall in a ba&s;ket; and when
Saul was come to Jeru&s;alem, he a&s;&s;ayed
to join him&s;elf to the di&s;ciples" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 25). Afterwards, "when
the brethren knew the con&s;piracy formed
again&s;t him at Jeru&s;alem, they brought
him down to Cae&s;area, and &s;ent him forth
to Tar&s;us, a city in Cilicia" (chap. ix.
<PB N="166" REF="168">
ver. 30). In the epi&s;tle, St. Paul gives
the following brief account of his proceed|ings
within the &s;ame period: "After three
years I went up to Jeru&s;alem to &s;ee Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days; after|wards
I came into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia." The hi&s;tory had told us that
Paul pa&s;&s;ed from Cae&s;area to Tar&s;us: if he
took this journey by land, it would carry
him through Syria into Cilicia; and he would
come, after his vi&s;it at Jeru&s;alem, "into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia," in the very
order in which he mentions them in the
epi&s;tle. This &s;uppo&s;ition of his going from
Cae&s;area to Tar&s;us <HI>by land,</HI> clears up al&s;o ano|ther
point. It accounts for what St. Paul
&s;ays in the &s;ame place concerning the churches
of Judea: "Afterwards I came into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia, and was un|known
by face unto the churches of Judea,
which were in Chri&s;t: but they had heard
only that he which per&s;ecuted us in times
pa&s;t, now preacheth the faith, which once
he de&s;troyed; and they glorified God in
me." Upon which pa&s;&s;age I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t,
that what is here &s;aid of the churches of
<PB N="167" REF="169">
Judea, is &s;poken in connection with his
journey into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Secondly, that the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf has little &s;ig|nificancy,
and that the <HI>connection</HI> is inexpli|cable,
unle&s;s St. Paul went through Judea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Doddridge thought that the Cae&s;area here men|tioned was not the celebrated city of that name upon the Mediterranean &s;ea, but Cae&s;area Philippi, near the borders of Syria, which lies in a much more direct line from Jeru&s;alem to Tar&s;us than the other. The objec|tion to this, Dr. Ben&s;on remarks, is, that Cae&s;area, without any addition, u&s;ually denotes Cae&s;area Pale&s;|tinae.</NOTE>
(though probably by a ha&s;ty journey) at
the time that he came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia. Suppo&s;e him to have
pa&s;&s;ed by land from Cae&s;area to Tar&s;us, all
this, as hath been ob&s;erved, would be pre|ci&s;ely
true.</P>
<P N="5">5. Barnabas was with Paul at Antioch.
"Then departed Barnabas to Tar&s;us, for to
&s;eek Saul; and when he had found him,
he brought him unto Antioch. And it
came to pa&s;s that a whole year they a&s;&s;em|bled
them&s;elves with the church." Acts,
chap. xi. ver. 25, 26. Again, and upon
another occa&s;ion, "they (Paul and Barnabas)
<PB N="168" REF="170">
&s;ailed to Antioch; and there they conti|nued
a long time with the di&s;ciples." Chap.
xiv. ver. 26.</P>
<P>Now what &s;ays the epi&s;tle? "When Peter
was come to Antioch, I with&s;tood him to
the face, becau&s;e he was to be blamed;
and the other Jews di&s;&s;embled likewi&s;e
with him; in&s;omuch that Barnabas al&s;o
was carried away with their di&s;&s;imula|tion."
Chap. ii. ver. 11. 13.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;tated re&s;idence of the apo&s;tles was
at Jeru&s;alem. "At that time there was a
great per&s;ecution again&s;t the church which
was at Jeru&s;alem; and they were all &s;cat|tered
abroad throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria, except the apo&s;tles"
(Acts, chap. viii. ver. 1). "They (the Chri&s;|tians
at Antioch) determined that Paul
and Barnabas &s;hould go up to Jeru&s;alem,
unto the apo&s;tles and elders, about this
que&s;tion" (Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). With
the&s;e accounts agrees the declaration in the
epi&s;tle: "Neither went I up to Jeru&s;alem
to them which were apo&s;tles before me"
(chap. i. ver. 17): for this declaration im|plies,
or rather a&s;&s;umes it to be known, that
<PB N="169" REF="171">
Jeru&s;alem was the place where the apo&s;tles
were to be met with.</P>
<P N="7">7. There were at Jeru&s;alem two apo&s;tles,
or at the lea&s;t two eminent members of the
church, of the name of James. This is di|rectly
inferred from the Acts of the Apo&s;tles,
which in the &s;econd ver&s;e of the twelfth
chapter relates the death of James, the bro|ther
of John; and yet in the fifteenth chap|ter,
and in a &s;ub&s;equent part of the hi&s;tory,
records a &s;peech delivered by James in the
a&s;&s;embly of the apo&s;tles and elders. It is
al&s;o &s;trongly implied by the form of expre&s;|&s;ion
u&s;ed in the epi&s;tle: "Other apo&s;tles &s;aw
I none, &s;ave James, the <HI>Lord's brother</HI>;"
<HI>i. e.</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h him from James the bro|ther
of John.</P>
<P>To us who have been long conver&s;ant in
the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, as contained in the
Acts of the Apo&s;tles, the&s;e points are obvious
and familiar; nor do we readily apprehend
any greater difficulty in making them appear
in a letter purporting to have been written by
St. Paul, than there is in introducing them into
a modern &s;ermon. But, to judge correctly of
the argument before us, we mu&s;t di&s;charge
<PB N="170" REF="172">
this knowledge from our thoughts. We mu&s;t
propo&s;e to our&s;elves the &s;ituation of an
author who &s;at down to the writing of the
epi&s;tle without having &s;een the hi&s;tory; and
then the concurrences we have deduced will
be deemed of importance. They will at lea&s;t
be taken for &s;eparate confirmations of the
&s;everal facts: and not only of the&s;e parti|cular
facts, but of the general truth of the
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For what is the rule with re&s;pect to cor|roborative
te&s;timony which prevails in courts
of ju&s;tice, and which prevails only becau&s;e
experience has proved that it is an u&s;eful
guide to truth? A principal witne&s;s in a
cau&s;e delivers his account: his narrative, in
certain parts of it, is confirmed by witne&s;&s;es
who are called afterwards. The credit de|rived
from their te&s;timony belongs not only
to the particular circum&s;tances in which the
auxiliary witne&s;&s;es agree with the principal
witne&s;s, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the whole
of his evidence; becau&s;e it is improbable
that accident or fiction &s;hould draw a
line which touched upon truth in &s;o many
points.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
In like manner, if two records be produced,
manife&s;tly independent, that is, manife&s;tly
written without any participation of intelli|gence,
an agreement between them, even in
few and &s;light circum&s;tances (e&s;pecially if,
from the different nature and de&s;ign of the
writings, few points only of agreement, and
tho&s;e incidental, could be expected to occur)
would add a &s;en&s;ible weight to the authority
of both, in every part of their contents.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule is applicable to hi&s;tory,
with at lea&s;t as much rea&s;on as any other
&s;pecies of evidence.</P>

<P>But although the references to various par|ticulars
in the epi&s;tle, compared with the di|rect
account of the &s;ame particulars in the
hi&s;tory, afford a con&s;iderable proof of the
truth not only of the&s;e particulars, but of
the narrative which contains them; yet they
do not &s;hew, it will be &s;aid, that the epi&s;tle was
written by St. Paul: for admitting (what &s;eems
to have been proved) that the writer, whoever
he was, had no recour&s;e to the Acts of the Apo|&s;tles,
<PB N="172" REF="174">
yet many of the facts referred to, &s;uch as
St. Paul's miraculous conver&s;ion, his change
from a virulent per&s;ecutor to an indefatigable
preacher, his labours among&s;t the Gentiles,
and his zeal for the liberties of the Gentile
church, were &s;o notorious, as to occur rea|dily
to the mind of any Chri&s;tian, who
&s;hould choo&s;e to per&s;onate his character, and
counterfeit his name: it was only to write
what every body knew. Now I think that
this &s;uppo&s;ition&mdash;viz. that the epi&s;tle was
compo&s;ed upon general information, and the
general publicity of the facts alluded to, and
that the author did no more than weave into
his work what the common fame of the
Chri&s;tian church had reported to his ears&mdash;is
repelled by the particularity of the recitals
and references. This particularity is ob&s;er|vable
in the following in&s;tances; in peru&s;ing
which, I de&s;ire the reader to reflect, whether
they exhibit the language of a man who had
nothing but general reputation to proceed
upon, or of a man actually &s;peaking of him|&s;elf
and of his own hi&s;tory, and con&s;equently
of things concerning which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
<PB N="173" REF="175">
clear, intimate, and circum&s;tantial know|ledge.</P>
<P N="1">1. The hi&s;tory, in giving an account of
St. Paul after his conver&s;ion, relates "that,
after many days," effecting, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the di&s;ciples, his e&s;cape from Dama&s;cus,
"he proceeded to Jeru&s;alem" (Acts, chap.
ix. ver. 25). The epi&s;tle, &s;peaking of the
&s;ame period, makes St. Paul &s;ay that "he
went into Arabia," that he returned again
to Dama&s;cus, that after three years he went
up to Jeru&s;alem. Chap. i. ver. 17, 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. The hi&s;tory relates, that, when Saul
was come from Dama&s;cus, "he was with the
di&s;ciples coming in and going out" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 28). The epi&s;tle, de&s;cribing
the &s;ame journey, tells us "that he went
up to Jeru&s;alem to &s;ee Peter, and abode
with him fifteen days." Chap. i. ver. 18.</P>
<P N="3">3. The hi&s;tory relates, that, when Paul
was come to Jeru&s;alem, "Barnabas took him
and brought him to the apo&s;tles" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 27). The epi&s;tle, "that he
&s;aw Peter; but other of the apo&s;tles &s;aw
he none, &s;ave James, the Lord's brother."
Chap. i. ver. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176">
Now this is as it &s;hould be. The hi&s;to|rian
delivers his account in general terms, as
of facts to which he was not pre&s;ent. The
per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of that account,
when he comes to &s;peak of the&s;e facts him|&s;elf,
particularizes time, names, and circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P N="4">4. The like notation of places, per&s;ons,
and dates, is met with in the account of
St. Paul's journey to Jeru&s;alem, given in the
&s;econd chapter of the epi&s;tle. It was four|teen
years after his conver&s;ion; it was in
company with Barnabas and Titus; it was
then that he met with James, Cephas, and
John; it was then al&s;o that it was agreed
among&s;t them, that they &s;hould go to the
circumci&s;ion, and he unto the Gentiles.</P>
<P N="5">5. The di&s;pute with Peter, which occupies
the &s;equel of the &s;econd chapter, is marked
with the &s;ame particularity. It was at An|tioch;
it was after certain came from James;
it was whil&s;t Barnabas was there, who was
carried away by their di&s;&s;imulation. The&s;e
examples negative the in&s;inuation, that the
epi&s;tle pre&s;ents nothing but indefinite allu|&s;ions
to public facts.</P>

therefore become your enemy, becau&s;e I

<P>With this pa&s;&s;age compare 2 Cor. chap.
xii. ver. 1-9: "It is not expedient for me,
doubtle&s;s, to glory; I will come to vi&s;ions
and revelations of the Lord. I knew a
man in Chri&s;t above fourteen years ago
(whether in the body I cannot tell, or
whether out of the body I cannot tell;
<PB N="176" REF="178">
God knoweth); &s;uch a one was caught up
to the third heaven: and I knew &s;uch a
man (whether in the body or out of the
body I cannot tell, God knoweth), how
that he was caught up into Paradi&s;e,
and heard un&s;peakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter. Of &s;uch an
one will I glory, yet of my&s;elf will I not
glory, but in mine infirmities: for, though
I would de&s;ire to glory, I &s;hall not be a
fool; for I will &s;ay the truth. But now I
forbear, le&s;t any man &s;hould think of me
above that which he &s;eeth me to be, or
that he heareth of me. And le&s;t I &s;hould
be exalted above mea&s;ure, through the
abundance of the revelations, there was
given to me <HI>a thorn in the fle&s;h, the me&s;&s;en|ger
of Satan to buffet me,</HI> le&s;t I &s;hould be
exalted above mea&s;ure. For this thing
I be&s;ought the Lord thrice, that it might
depart from me. And he &s;aid unto me,
My grace is &s;ufficient for thee; for my
&s;trength is made perfect in weakne&s;s.
Mo&s;t gladly therefore will I rather glory
in my infirmities, that the power of Chri&s;t
may re&s;t upon me."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">
There can be no doubt but that "the
temptation which was in the fle&s;h," men|tioned
in the Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, and
"the thorn in the fle&s;h, the me&s;&s;enger of Sa|tan
to buffet him," mentioned in the Epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, were intended to denote
the &s;ame thing. Either therefore it was,
what we pretend it to have been, the &s;ame
per&s;on in both, alluding, as the occa&s;ion led
him, to &s;ome bodily infirmity under which
he laboured; that is, we are reading the real
letters of a real apo&s;tle; or, it was that a
&s;ophi&s;t, who had &s;een this circum&s;tance in
one epi&s;tle, contrived, for the &s;ake of cor|re&s;pondency,
to bring it into another; or,
la&s;tly, it was a circum&s;tance in St. Paul's
per&s;onal condition, &s;uppo&s;ed to be well
known to tho&s;e into who&s;e hands the epi&s;tle
was likely to fall; and, for that rea&s;on, in|troduced
into a writing de&s;igned to bear his
name. I have extracted the quotations at
length, in order to enable the reader to judge
accurately of the manner in which the men|tion
of this particular comes in, in each; be|cau&s;e
that judgment, I think, will acquit the
authors of the epi&s;tle of the charge of
<PB N="178" REF="180">
having &s;tudiou&s;ly in&s;erted it, either with a
view of producing an apparent agreement
between them, or for any other purpo&s;e
whatever.</P>
<P>The context, by which the circum&s;tance
before us in introduced, is in the two places
totally different, and without any mark of
imitation; yet in both places does the cir|cum&s;tance
ri&s;e aptly and naturally out of the
context, and that context from the train of
thought carried on in the epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, from the
beginning to the end, runs in a &s;train of
angry complaint of their defection from the
apo&s;tle, and from the principles which he
had taught them. It was very natural to
contra&s;t, with this conduct, the zeal with
which they had once received him; and it
was not le&s;s &s;o to mention, as a proof of their
former di&s;po&s;ition towards him, the indul|gence
which, whil&s;t he was among&s;t them,
they had &s;hewn to his infirmity: "My
temptation which was in the fle&s;h ye de|&s;pi&s;ed
not, nor rejected, but received me
as an angel of God, even as Chri&s;t Je&s;us.
Where is then the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s you &s;pake
<PB N="179" REF="181">
of, <HI>i. e.</HI> the benedictions which you be|&s;towed
upon me? for I bear you record,
that if it had been po&s;&s;ible, ye would
have plucked out your own eyes, and
have given them to me."</P>
<P>In the two Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians,
e&s;pecially in the &s;econd, we have the apo&s;tle
contending with certain teachers in Corinth,
who had formed a party in that church
again&s;t him. To vindicate his per&s;onal au|thority,
as well as the dignity and credit of
his mini&s;try among&s;t them, he takes occa&s;ion
(but not without apologizing repeatedly for
the folly, that is, for the indecorum of pro|nouncing
his own panegyric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Would to God you would bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed bear with me." Chap. xi. ver. 1.</P>
<P>"That which I &s;peak, I &s;peak it not after the Lord, but as it were fooli&s;hly, in this confidence of boa&s;ting." Chap. xi. ver. 17.</P>
<P>"I am become a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me." Chap. xii. ver. 11.</P></NOTE>) to meet his
adver&s;aries in their boa&s;tings: "Wherein|&s;oever
any is bold (I &s;peak fooli&s;hly) I
am bold al&s;o. Are they Hebrews? &s;o am
I. Are they I&s;raelites? &s;o am I. Are they
<PB N="180" REF="182">
the &s;eed of Abraham? &s;o am I. Are
they the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t? (I &s;peak as a
fool) I am more; in labours more abun|dant,
in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri&s;ons
more frequent, in deaths o&s;t." Being thus
led to the &s;ubject, he goes on, as was natural,
to recount his trials and dangers, his ince&s;&s;ant
cares and labours in the Chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ion.
From the proofs which he had given of his
zeal and activity in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t,
he pa&s;&s;es (and that with the &s;ame view of
e&s;tabli&s;hing his claim to be con&s;idered as
"not a whit behind the very chiefe&s;t of the
apo&s;tels") to the vi&s;ions and revelations
which from time to time had been vouch|&s;afed
to him. And then, by a clo&s;e and
ea&s;y connection, comes in the mention of
his in&s;irmity: "Le&s;t I &s;hould be exalted,"
&s;ays he, "above mea&s;ure, through the abund|ance
of revelations, there was given to me
a thorn in the fle&s;h, the me&s;&s;enger of Satan
to buffet me."</P>
<P>Thus then, in both epi&s;tles, the notice of
his infirmity is &s;uited to the place in which
it is found. In the Epi&s;tle to the Corin|thians,
the train of thought draws up to the
<PB N="181" REF="183">
circum&s;tance by a regular approximation.
In the epi&s;tle, it is &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;ubject
and occa&s;ion of the epi&s;tle it&s;elf. Which
ob&s;ervation we offer as an argument to prove
that it is not, in either epi&s;tle, a circum&s;tance
indu&s;triou&s;ly brought forward for the &s;ake
of procuring credit to an impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>A reader will be taught to perceive the
force of this argument, who &s;hall attempt to
introduce a <HI>given</HI> circum&s;tance into the body
of a writing. To do this without abrupt|ne&s;s,
or without betraying marks of de&s;ign
in the tran&s;ition, requires, he will find, more
art than he expected to be nece&s;&s;ary, cer|tainly
more than any one can believe to
have been exerci&s;ed in the compo&s;ition of
the&s;e epi&s;tles.</P>

<P>From the&s;e &s;everal texts, it is apparent
that the per&s;ecutions which our apo&s;tle had
undergone, were from the hands or by the
in&s;tigation of the Jews; that it was not
for preaching Chri&s;tianity in oppo&s;ition to
heatheni&s;m, but it was for preaching it as
di&s;tinct from Judai&s;m, that he had brought
upon him&s;elf the &s;ufferings which had at|tended
his mini&s;try. And this repre&s;entation
perfectly coincides with that which re&s;ults
from the detail of St. Paul's hi&s;tory, as deli|vered
in the Acts. At Antioch, in Pi&s;idia, the
"word of the Lord was publi&s;hed through|out
all the region; but the <HI>Jews &s;tirred
up</HI> the devout and honourable women and
the chief men of the city, and rai&s;ed
per&s;ecution again&s;t Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them out of their coa&s;ts"
(Acts, chap. xiii. ver. 50). Not long after,
at Iconium, "a great multitude of the Jews
"and al&s;o of the Greeks believed; but the
<PB N="183" REF="185">
<HI>unbelieving Jews</HI> &s;tirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected again&s;t
the brethren" (chap. xiv. ver. 1, 2). "At
Ly&s;tra there came certain Jews from An|tioch
and Iconium, who per&s;uaded the
people; and having &s;toned Paul, drew him
out of the city, &s;uppo&s;ing he had been
dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). The &s;ame
enmity, and from the &s;ame quarter, our apo|&s;tle
experienced in Greece: "At The&s;&s;alo|nica,
&s;ome of them (the Jews) believed,
and con&s;orted with Paul and Silas; and of
the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of
the chief women not a few: but <HI>the Jews
which believed not,</HI> moved with envy, took
unto them certain lewd fellows of the ba&s;er
&s;ort, and gathered a company, and &s;et all
the city in an uproar, and a&s;&s;aulted the
hou&s;e of Ja&s;on, and &s;ought to bring them
out to the people" (Acts, chap. xvii.
ver. 4, 5). Their per&s;ecutors follow them to
Beraea: "When the <HI>Jews</HI> of The&s;&s;alonica
had knowledge that the word of God was
preached of St. Paul at Beraea, they came
thither al&s;o, and &s;tirred up the people"
(chap. xvii. ver. 13). And la&s;tly at Corinth,
<PB N="184" REF="186">
when Gallio was deputy of Achaia, "<HI>the
Jews</HI> made in&s;urrection with one accord
again&s;t Paul, and brought him to the
judgment-&s;eat." I think it does not ap|pear
that our apo&s;tle was ever &s;et upon by
the Gentiles, unle&s;s they were fir&s;t &s;tirred
up by the Jews, except in two in&s;tances; in
both which the per&s;ons who began the a&s;|&s;ault
were immediately intere&s;ted in his ex|pul&s;ion
from the place. Once this happened
at Philippi, after the cure of the Pythone&s;s:
"When the ma&s;ters &s;aw the hope of their
gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas,
and drew them into the market-place unto
the rulers" (chap. xvi. ver. 19). And a
&s;econd time at Ephe&s;us, at the in&s;tance of
Demetrius a &s;ilver&s;mith which made &s;ilver
&s;hrines for Diana, "who called together work|men
of like occupation, and &s;aid, Sirs, ye
know that by this craft we have our wealth;
moreover, ye &s;ee and hear that not only at

<P>I ob&s;erve an agreement in a &s;omewhat
peculiar rule of Chri&s;tian conduct, as laid
down in this epi&s;tle, and as exemplified in
the &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. It is
not the repetition of the &s;ame general pre|cept,
which would have been a coincidence
of little value; but it is the general pre|cept
in one place, and the application of
that precept to an actual occurrence in the
other. In the &s;ixth chapter and fir&s;t ver&s;e
of this epi&s;tle, our apo&s;tle gives the follow|ing
direction: "Brethren, if a man be over|taken
in a fault, ye, which are &s;piritual,
re&s;tore &s;uch a one in the &s;pirit of meek|ne&s;s."
In 2 Cor. chap. ii. ver. 6-8, he
writes thus: "Sufficient to &s;uch a man" (the
ince&s;tuous per&s;on mentioned in the fir&s;t
epi&s;tle) "is this puni&s;hment, which was in|flicted
of many; &s;o that, contrariwi&s;e, ye
<PB N="186" REF="188">
ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him, le&s;t perhaps &s;uch a one &s;hould be
&s;wallowed up with over-much &s;orrow;
wherefore I be&s;eech you that ye would
confirm your love towards him." I have
little doubt but that it was the &s;ame mind
which dictated the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Our epi&s;tle goes farther than any of St.
Paul's epi&s;tles; for it avows in direct terms
the &s;uper&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Jewi&s;h law, as an
in&s;trument of &s;alvation, even to the Jews
them&s;elves. Not only were the Gentiles
exempt from its authority, but even the
Jews were no longer either to place any
dependency upon it, or con&s;ider them&s;elves
as &s;ubject to it on a religious account. "Be|fore
faith came, we were kept under the
law, &s;hut up unto the faith which &s;hould
afterwards be revealed; wherefore the law
was our &s;choolma&s;ter to bring us unto
Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by faith;
but, after that faith is come, <HI>we are no longer
under a &s;choolma&s;ter</HI>" (ch. iii. ver. 23-25).</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
This was undoubtedly &s;poken of Jews
and to Jews. In like manner, chap. iv.
ver. 1-5: "Now I &s;ay that the heir, as
long as he is a child, differeth nothing
from a &s;ervant, though he be lord of all;
but is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed of the father: even &s;o we,
when we were children, were in bondage
under the elements of the world; but, when
the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent
forth his Son, made of a woman, made
under the law, to <HI>redeem them that were
under the law,</HI> that we might receive the
adoption of &s;ons." The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are no|thing
&s;hort of a declaration, that the obliga|tion
of the Jewi&s;h law, con&s;idered as a reli|gious
di&s;pen&s;ation, the effects of which were
to take place in another life, had cea&s;ed,
with re&s;pect even to the Jews them&s;elves.
What then &s;hould be the conduct of a Jew
(for &s;uch St. Paul was) who preached this
doctrine? To be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf,
either he would no longer comply, in his
own per&s;on, with the directions of the law;
or, if he did comply, it would be for &s;ome
other rea&s;on than any con&s;idence which he
<PB N="188" REF="190">
placed in its efficacy, as a religious in&s;titution.
Now &s;o it happens, that whenever St. Paul's
compliance with the Jewi&s;h law is mentioned
in the hi&s;tory, it is mentioned in connection
with circum&s;tances which point out the motive
from which it proceeded; and this motive
appears to have been always exoteric, namely,
a love of order and tranquillity, or an un|willingne&s;s
to give unnece&s;&s;ary offence. Thus,
Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 3: "Him (Timothy)
would Paul have to go forth with him,
and took and circumci&s;ed him, <HI>becau&s;e of
the Jews which were in tho&s;e quarters.</HI>"
Again (Acts, chap. xxi. ver. 26), when Paul
con&s;ented to exhibit an example of public
compliance with a Jewi&s;h rite, by purifying
him&s;elf in the temple, it is plainly intimat|ed
that he did this to &s;atisfy "many thou|&s;and
of Jews who believed, and who were
all zealous of the law." So far the in|&s;tances
related in one book, corre&s;pond with
the doctrine delivered in another.</P>

<P>Chap. i. ver. 18. "Then, after three
years, I went up to Jeru&s;alem to &s;ee Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days."</P>
<P>The &s;hortne&s;s of St. Paul's &s;tay at Jeru&s;a|lem,
is what I de&s;ire the reader to remark.
The direct account of the &s;ame journey in
the Acts, chap. ix. ver. 28, determines no|thing
concerning the time of his continu|ance
there: "And he was with them (the
apo&s;tles) coming in, and going out, at Je|ru&s;alem;
and he &s;pake boldly in the name
of the Lord Je&s;us, and di&s;puted again&s;t
the Grecians, but they went about to &s;lay
him; which when the brethren knew,
they brought him down to Cae&s;area." Or
rather this account, taken by it&s;elf, would
lead a reader to &s;uppo&s;e that St. Paul's abode
at Jeru&s;alem had been longer than fifteen
days. But turn to the twenty-&s;econd chap|ter
of the Acts, and you will find a reference
to this vi&s;it to Jeru&s;alem, which plainly in|dicates
that Paul's continuance in that city
had been of &s;hort duration: "And it came
<PB N="190" REF="192">
to pa&s;s, that when I was come again
to Jeru&s;alem, even while I prayed in the
temple, I was in a trance, and &s;aw him
&s;aying unto me, Make ha&s;te, get thee
quickly out of Jeru&s;alem, for they will
not receive thy te&s;timony concerning me."
Here we have the general terms of one text
&s;o explained by a di&s;tant text in the &s;ame
book, as to bring an indeterminate expre&s;&s;ion

<P>Chap. vi. ver. 11. "Ye &s;ee how large a
letter I have written unto you with mine
own hand."</P>
<P>The&s;e words imply that he did not always
write with his own hand; which is con&s;onant
to what we find intimated in &s;ome other of
the epi&s;tles. The Epi&s;tle to the Romans
was written by Tertius: "I Tertius, who
wrote this epi&s;tle, &s;alute you in the Lord"
(chap. xvi. ver. 22). The fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to
<PB N="191" REF="193">
the Corinthians, the Epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;|&s;ians,
and the &s;econd to the The&s;&s;alonians,
have all, near the conclu&s;ion, this clau&s;e.
"The &s;alutation of me, Paul, with mine own
hand;" which mu&s;t be under&s;tood, and
is univer&s;ally under&s;tood to import, that the
re&s;t of the epi&s;tle was written by another
hand. I do not think it improbable that an
impo&s;tor, who had remarked this &s;ub&s;crip|tion
in &s;ome other epi&s;tle, &s;hould invent the
&s;ame in a forgery; but that is not done
here. The author of this epi&s;tle does not
imitate the manner of giving St. Paul's &s;ig|nature;
he only bids the Galatians ob&s;erve
how large a letter he had written to them
with his own hand. He does not &s;ay this
was different from his ordinary u&s;age;
that is left to implication. Now to &s;up|po&s;e
that this was an artifice to procure cre|dit
to an impo&s;ture, is to &s;uppo&s;e that the
author of the forgery, becau&s;e he knew that
others of St. Paul's were <HI>not</HI> written by him|&s;elf,
therefore made the apo&s;tle &s;ay that this
was: which &s;eems an odd turn to give to
the circum&s;tance, and to be given for a pur|po&s;e,
which would more naturally and more
<PB N="192" REF="194">
directly have been an&s;wered, by &s;ubjoining
the &s;alutation or &s;ignature in the form in
which it is found in other epi&s;tles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words <GAP DESC="foreign"> may probably be meant to de&s;cribe the character in which he wrote, and not the length of the letter. But this will not alter the truth of our ob&s;ervation. I think however, that as St. Paul by the mention of his own hand de&s;igned to expre&s;s to the Galatians the great concern which he felt for them, the words, whatever they &s;ignify, belong to the whole of the epi&s;tle; and not, as Grotius, after St. Jerom, interprets it, to the few ver&s;es which follow.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>An exact conformity appears in the man|ner
in which a certain apo&s;tle or eminent
Chri&s;tian, who&s;e name was James, is &s;po|ken
of in the epi&s;tle and in the hi&s;tory.
Both writings refer to a &s;ituation of his at
Jeru&s;alem, &s;omewhat different from that of
the other apo&s;tles; a kind of eminence or
pre&s;idency in the church there, or at lea&s;t a
more fixed and &s;tationary re&s;idence. Chap.
ii. ver. 12, "When Peter was at Antioch,
before that certain came from James, he
did eat with the Gentiles." This text
<PB N="193" REF="195">
plainly attributes a kind of pre-eminency to
James; and, as we hear of him twice in the
&s;ame epi&s;tle dwelling at Jeru&s;alem, chap. i.
ver. 19, and ii. 9, we mu&s;t apply it to the
&s;ituation which he held in that church. In
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles divers intimations
occur, conveying the &s;ame idea of James's
&s;ituation. When Peter was miraculou&s;ly
delivered from pri&s;on, and had &s;urpri&s;ed his
friends by his appearance among them,
after declaring unto them how the Lord
had brought him out of pri&s;on, "Go &s;hew,"
&s;ays he, "the&s;e things unto James, and to
"the brethren" (Acts, chap. xii. ver. 17).
Here James is manife&s;tly &s;poken of in terms
of di&s;tinction. He appears again with like
di&s;tinction in the twenty-fir&s;t chapter and
the &s;eventeenth and eighteenth ver&s;es: "And
when we" (Paul and his company) "were
come to Jeru&s;alem; the day following, Paul
went in with us unto James, and all the
elders were pre&s;ent." In the debate which
took place upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Gentile
converts, in the council at Jeru&s;alem, this
&s;ame per&s;on &s;eems to have taken the lead.
It was he who clo&s;ed the debate, and pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="194" REF="196">
the re&s;olution in which the council
ultimately concurred: "Wherefore my &s;en|tence
is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles are turned to
God."</P>
<P>Upon the whole, that there exi&s;ts a con|formity
in the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed concerning
<HI>James,</HI> throughout the hi&s;tory, and in the
epi&s;tle, is unque&s;tionable. But admitting
this conformity, and admitting al&s;o the un|de&s;ignedne&s;s
of it, what does it prove? It
proves that the circum&s;tance it&s;elf is founded
in truth; that is, that James was a real
per&s;on, who held a &s;ituation of eminence in
a real &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem. It
confirms al&s;o tho&s;e parts of the narrative
which are connected with this circum&s;tance.
Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, the truth of the ac|count
of Peter's e&s;cape from pri&s;on was to
be tried upon the te&s;timony of a witne&s;s
who, among&s;t other things, made Peter, after
his deliverance, &s;ay, "Go &s;hew the&s;e things
to James and to the brethren;" would it
not be material, in &s;uch a trial, to make out
by other independent proofs, or by a com|pari&s;on
of proofs drawn from independent
<PB N="195" REF="197">
&s;ources, that there was actually at that time,
living at Jeru&s;alem, &s;uch a per&s;on as James;
that this per&s;on held &s;uch a &s;ituation in the
&s;ociety among&s;t whom the&s;e things were
tran&s;acted, as to render the words which
Peter is &s;aid to have u&s;ed concerning him,
proper and natural for him to have u&s;ed? If
this would be pertinent in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of
oral te&s;timony, it is &s;till more &s;o in appre|ciating
the credit of remote hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled that the com|pari&s;on
of our epi&s;tle with the hi&s;tory pre|&s;ents
&s;ome difficulties, or, to &s;ay the lea&s;t,
&s;ome que&s;tions, of con&s;iderable magnitude.
It may be doubted, in the fir&s;t place, to what
journey the words which open the &s;econd
chapter of the epi&s;tle, "then, fourteen years
afterwards, I went unto Jeru&s;alem," relate.
That which be&s;t corre&s;ponds with the date,
and that to which mo&s;t interpreters apply
the pa&s;&s;age, is the journey of Paul and Bar|nabas
to Jeru&s;alem, when they went thither
from Antioch, upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Gen|tile
converts; and which journey produced
the famous council and decree recorded in
the fifteenth chapter of Acts. To me this
<PB N="196" REF="198">
opinion appears to be encumbered with
&s;trong objections. In the epi&s;tle Paul tells
us that "he went up by revelation" (chap.
ii. ver. 2). In the Acts, we read that he
was &s;ent by the church of Antioch: "After
no &s;mall di&s;&s;en&s;ion and di&s;putation, they
determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, &s;hould go up to the
apo&s;tles and elders about this que&s;tion"
(Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). This is not very
reconcileable. In the epi&s;tle St. Paul writes
that, when he came to Jeru&s;alem, "he com|municated
that Go&s;pel which he preached
among the Gentiles, but privately to them
which were of reputation" (chap. ii. ver.
2). If by "that Go&s;pel" be meant the im|munity
of the Gentile Chri&s;tians from the
Jewi&s;h law (and I know not what el&s;e it
can mean), it is not ea&s;y to conceive how he
&s;hould communicate that privately, which
was the &s;ubject of his public me&s;&s;age. But
a yet greater difficulty remains, viz. that in
the account which the epi&s;tle gives of what
pa&s;&s;ed upon this vi&s;it at Jeru&s;alem, no notice
is taken of the deliberation and decree which
are recorded in the Acts, and which, ac|cording
<PB N="197" REF="199">
to that hi&s;tory, formed the bu&s;ine&s;s
for the &s;ake of which the journey was un|dertaken.
The mention of the council and
of its determination, whil&s;t the apo&s;tle was
relating his proceedings at Jeru&s;alem, could
hardly have been avoided, if in truth the
narrative belong to the &s;ame journey. To
me it appears more probable that Paul and
Barnabas had taken &s;ome journey to Jeru&s;a|lem,
the mention of which is omitted in the
Acts. Prior to the apo&s;tolic decree, we read
that "Paul and Barnabas abode at Antioch
a long time with the di&s;ciples" (Acts,
chap. xiv. ver. 28). Is it is unlikely that, du|ring
this long abode, they might go up to Je|ru&s;alem
and return to Antioch? Or would
the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a journey be un&s;uitable
to the general brevity with which the&s;e
memoirs are written, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e
parts of St. Paul's hi&s;tory which took place
before the hi&s;torian joined his &s;ociety?</P>
<P>But, again, the fir&s;t account we find in
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles of St. Paul's vi&s;iting
Galatia, is in the &s;ixteenth chapter, and the
&s;ixth ver&s;e: "Now when they had gone
through Phrygia and the region of Ga|latia,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
they a&s;&s;ayed to go into Bithynia."
The progre&s;s here recorded was &s;ub&s;equent
to the apo&s;tolic decree; therefore that de|cree
mu&s;t have been extant when our epi&s;tle
was written. Now, as the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign
of the epi&s;tle was to e&s;tabli&s;h the exemp|tion
of the Gentile converts from the law
of Mo&s;es, and as the decree pronounced
and confirmed that exemption, it may &s;eem
extraordinary that no notice whatever is
taken of that determination, nor any appeal
made to its authority. Much however of
the weight of this objection, which applies
al&s;o to &s;ome other of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, is
removed by the following reflections.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was not St. Paul's manner, nor agree|able
to it, to re&s;ort or defer much to the au|thority
of the other apo&s;tles, e&s;pecially whil&s;t
he was in&s;i&s;ting, as he does &s;trenuou&s;ly
throughout this epi&s;tle in&s;i&s;t, upon his own
original in&s;piration. He who could &s;peak
of the very chiefe&s;t of the apo&s;tles in &s;uch
terms as the following&mdash;"of tho&s;e who
&s;eemed to be &s;omewhat (what&s;oever they
were it maketh no matter to me, God
accepteth no man's per&s;on) for they who
<PB N="199" REF="201">
&s;eemed to be &s;omewhat in conference
added nothing to me"&mdash;he, I &s;ay, was not
likely to &s;upport him&s;elf by their deci&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The epi&s;tle argues the point upon
principle; and it is not perhaps more to be
wondered at, that in &s;uch an argument St.
Paul &s;hould not cite the apo&s;tolic decree,
than it would be that, in a di&s;cour&s;e de&s;igned
to prove the moral and religious duty of
ob&s;erving the &s;abbath, the writer &s;hould not
quote the thirteenth canon.</P>
<P N="3">3. The decree did not go the length of
the po&s;ition maintained in the epi&s;tle; the
decree only declares that the apo&s;tles and
elders at Jeru&s;alem did not impo&s;e the ob|&s;ervance
of the Mo&s;aic law upon the Gen|tile
converts, as a condition of their being
admitted into the Chri&s;tian church. Our
epi&s;tle argues that the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution
it&s;elf was at an end, as to all effects upon
a future &s;tate, even with re&s;pect to the Jews
them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who&s;e error St. Paul combat|ted,
were not per&s;ons who &s;ubmitted to
the Jewi&s;h law, becau&s;e it was impo&s;ed by
the authority, or becau&s;e it was made part
<PB N="200" REF="202">
of the law of the Chri&s;tian church; but they
were per&s;ons who, having already become
Chri&s;tians, afterwards voluntarily took upon
them&s;elves the ob&s;ervance of the Mo&s;aic
code, under a notion of attaining thereby to
a greater perfection. This, I think, is pre|ci&s;ely
the opinion which St. Paul oppo&s;es
in this epi&s;tle. Many of his expre&s;&s;ions
apply exactly to it: "Are ye &s;o fooli&s;h?
having begun in the &s;pirit, are ye now
made perfect in the fle&s;h?" (chap. iii.
ver. 3). "Tell me, ye that de&s;ire to be
under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
(chap. iv. ver. 21.) "How turn ye again
to the weak and beggarly elements, where|-unto
ye de&s;ire again to be in bondage?"
(chap. iv. ver. 9). It cannot be thought
extraordinary that St. Paul &s;hould re&s;i&s;t this
opinion with earne&s;tne&s;s; for it both changed
the character of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation,
and derogated expre&s;sly from the complete|ne&s;s
of that redemption which Je&s;us Chri&s;t
had wrought for them that believed in him.
But it was to no purpo&s;e to alledge to &s;uch
per&s;ons the deci&s;ion at Jeru&s;alem, for that
only &s;hewed that they were not bound to
<PB N="201" REF="203">
the&s;e ob&s;ervances by any law of the Chri&s;tian
church: they did not pretend to be &s;o bound.
Neverthele&s;s they imagined that there was an
efficacy in the&s;e ob&s;ervances, a merit, a re|commendation
to favour, and a ground of
acceptance with God for tho&s;e who com|plied
with them. This was a &s;ituation of
thought to which the tenor of the decree
did not apply. Accordingly, St. Paul's ad|dre&s;s
to the Galatians, which is throughout
adapted to this &s;ituation, runs in a &s;train
widely different from the language of the
decree: "Chri&s;t is become of no effect unto
you, who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the
law" (chap. v. ver. 4); <HI>i. e.</HI> who&s;oever
places his dependance upon any merit he
may apprehend there to be in legal ob&s;er|vances.
The decree had &s;aid nothing like
this; therefore it would have been u&s;ele&s;s
to have produced the decree in an argument
of which this was the burthen. In like
manner as in contending with an anchorite,
who &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;uperior holine&s;s
of a reclu&s;e, a&s;cetic life, and the value of
&s;uch mortifications in the &s;ight of God, it
would be to no purpo&s;e to prove that the
<PB N="202" REF="204">
laws of the church did not require the&s;e
vows, or even to prove that the laws of the
church expre&s;sly left every Chri&s;tian to his
liberty. This would avail little towards
abating his e&s;timation of their merit, or to|wards
&s;ettling the point in controver&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Locke's &s;olution of this difficulty is by no means &s;atisfactory. "St. Paul," he &s;ays, "did not remind the Galatians of the apo&s;tolic decree, becau&s;e they already had it." In the fir&s;t place, it does not appear with certainty that they had it; in the &s;econd place, if they had it, this was rather a rea&s;on, than other|wi&s;e, for referring them to it. The pa&s;&s;age in the Acts, from which Mr. Locke concludes that the Galatic churches were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the decree, is the fourth ver&s;e of the &s;ixteenth chapter: "And as they" (Paul and Timothy) "went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apo&s;tles and elders which were at Jeru&s;alem." In my opinion, this delivery of the decree was confined to the churches to which St. Paul came, in pur&s;uance of the plan upon which he &s;et out, of "vi&s;iting the brethren in every city where he had preached the word of the Lord;" the hi&s;tory of which progre&s;s, and of all that pertained to it, is clo&s;ed in the fifth ver&s;e, when the hi&s;|tory informs us that "&s;o were the churches e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith, and increa&s;ed in number daily." Then the hi&s;tory proceeds upon a new &s;ection of the narrative, by telling us that "when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they a&s;&s;ayed to go into Bithynia." The decree it&s;elf is directed "to the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia;" that is, to churches already found|ed, and in which this que&s;tion had been &s;tirred. And I think the ob&s;ervation of the noble author of the Mi&s;cel|lanea Sacra is not only ingenious, but highly probable, viz. that there is, in this place, a di&s;location of the text, and that the fourth and fifth ver&s;es of the &s;ixteenth chapter ought to follow the la&s;t ver&s;e of the fifteenth, &s;o as to make the entire pa&s;&s;age run thus: "And they went through Syria and Cilicia" (to the Chri&s;tians of which countries the decree was addre&s;&s;ed), "confirming the churches; and as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apo&s;tles and elders which were at Jeru|&s;alem; and &s;o were the churches e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith, and increa&s;ed in number daily." And then the &s;ixteenth chapter takes up a new and unbroken para|graph: "Then came he to Derbe and Ly&s;tra, &amp;c." When St. Paul came, as he did into Galatia, to preach the go&s;pel, for the fir&s;t time, in a new place, it is not probable that he would make mention of the decree, or rather letter, of the church of Jeru&s;alem, which pre|&s;uppo&s;ed Chri&s;tianity to be known, and which related to certain doubts that had ari&s;en in &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed Chri&s;|tian communities.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rea&s;on which Mr. Locke a&s;&s;igns for the omi&s;&s;ion of the decree, viz. "that St. Paul's &s;ole object in the epi&s;tle, was to acquit him&s;elf of the imput&aacute;tion that had been charged upon him of actually preaching circumci&s;ion," does not appear to me to be &s;trictly true. It was not the &s;ole object. The epi&s;tle is written in general oppo&s;ition to the Judaizing inclinations which he found to prevail among&s;t his converts. The avowal of his own doctrine, and of his &s;teadfa&s;t adherence to that doctrine, formed a nece&s;&s;ary part of the de&s;ign of his letter, but was not the whole of it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205">
Another difficulty ari&s;es from the account
of Peter's conduct towards the Gentile con|verts
at Antioch, as given in the epi&s;tle, in
the latter part of the &s;econd chapter; which
conduct, it is &s;aid, is con&s;i&s;tent neither with
the revelation communicated to him, upon
<PB N="204" REF="206">
the conver&s;ion of Cornelius, nor with the
part he took in the debate at Jeru&s;alem.
But, in order to under&s;tand either the diffi|culty
or the &s;olution, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;tate and explain the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf. "When
Peter was come to Antioch, I with&s;tood
him to the face, becau&s;e he was to be
blamed; for, before that certain came
from James, he did eat with the Gentiles;
but when they were come, he withdrew
and &s;eparated him&s;elf, fearing them which
were of the circumci&s;ion; and the other
Jews di&s;&s;embled likewi&s;e with him, in|&s;omuch
that Barnabas al&s;o was carried
away with their di&s;&s;imulation: but when
<PB N="205" REF="207">
I &s;aw they walked not uprightly, according
to the truth of the Go&s;pel, I &s;aid unto
Peter, before them all, If thou, being a
Jew, live&s;t after the manner of Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, why compelle&s;t
thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?" Now the que&s;tion that produced
the di&s;pute to which the&s;e words relate, was
not whether the Gentiles were capable of
being admitted into the Chri&s;tian covenant;
that had been fully &s;ettled: nor was it
whether it &s;hould be accounted e&s;&s;ential to
the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity that they &s;hould
conform them&s;elves to the law of Mo&s;es;
that was the que&s;tion at Jeru&s;alem: but it
was, whether, upon the Gentiles becoming
Chri&s;tians, the Jews might thenceforth eat
and drink with them, as with their own bre|thren.
Upon this point St. Peter betrayed
&s;ome incon&s;tancy; and &s;o he might, agree|ably
enough to his hi&s;tory. He might con|&s;ider
the vi&s;ion at Joppa as a direction for
the occa&s;ion, rather than as univer&s;ally abo|li&s;hing
the di&s;tinction between Jew and
Gentile; I do not mean with re&s;pect to final
<PB N="206" REF="208">
acceptance with God, but as to the manner
of their living together in &s;ociety: at lea&s;t
he might not have comprehended this point
with &s;uch clearne&s;s and certainty, as to &s;tand
out upon it again&s;t the fear of bringing upon
him&s;elf the cen&s;ure and complaint of his
brethren in the church of Jeru&s;alem, who
&s;till adhered to their ancient prejudices. But
Peter, it is &s;aid, compelled the Gentiles
<GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;"why compelle&s;t thou the Gen|tiles
to live as do the Jews?" How did he do
that? The only way in which Peter appears
to have compelled the Gentiles to comply
with the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution, was by with|drawing
him&s;elf from their &s;ociety. By
which he may be under&s;tood to have made
this declaration: "We do not deny your
right to be con&s;idered as Chri&s;tians; we
do not deny your title in the promi&s;es of
the Go&s;pel, even without compliance with
our law; but if you would have us Jews
live with you, as we do with one another,
that is, if you would in all re&s;pects be
treated by us as Jews, you mu&s;t live as &s;uch
your&s;elves." This, I think, was the com|pul&s;ion
<PB N="207" REF="209">
which St. Peter's conduct impo&s;ed
upon the Gentiles, and for which St. Paul
reproved him.</P>
<P>As to the part which the hi&s;torian a&s;cribes
to St. Peter, in the debate at Jeru&s;alem, be|&s;ide
that it was a different que&s;tion which
was there agitated from that which pro|duced
the di&s;pute at Antioch, there is no|thing
to hinder us from &s;uppo&s;ing that the
di&s;pute at Antioch was prior to the con&s;ulta|tion
at Jeru&s;alem; or that Peter, in con&s;e|quence
of this rebuke, might have afterwards
maintained firmer &s;entiments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS epi&s;tle, and the epi&s;tle to the
Colo&s;&s;ians, appear to have been tran&s;|mitted
to their re&s;pective churches by the
&s;ame me&s;&s;enger: "But that ye al&s;o may
know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
a beloved brother and faithful mini&s;ter in
the Lord, &s;hall make known to you all
things; whom I have &s;ent unto you for
the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that ye might know
our affairs, and that he might comfort
your hearts" (Eph. chap. vi. ver. 21, 22).
This text, if it do not expre&s;sly declare,
clearly I think intimates, that the letter
was &s;ent by Tychicus. The words made
u&s;e of in the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians are
very &s;imilar to the&s;e, and afford the &s;ame
implication that Tychicus, in conjunction
with One&s;imus, was the bearer of the letter
<PB N="209" REF="211">
to that church: "All my &s;tate &s;hall Tychicus
declare unto you, who is a beloved bro|ther,
and a faithful mini&s;ter, and fellow
&s;ervant in the Lord, whom I have &s;ent
unto you for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that he
might know your e&s;tate, and comfort your
hearts; with One&s;imus, a faithful and be|loved
brother, who is one of you: they
&s;hall make known unto you all things
which are done here" (Colo&s;. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9). Both epi&s;tles repre&s;ent the writer
as under impri&s;onment for the go&s;pel; and
both treat of the &s;ame general &s;ubject. The
epi&s;tle therefore to the Ephe&s;ians, and the
epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, import to be two
letters written by the &s;ame per&s;on, at, or
nearly at, the &s;ame time, and upon the &s;ame
&s;ubject, and to have been &s;ent by the &s;ame
me&s;&s;enger. Now, every thing in the &s;enti|ments,
order, and diction of the two writings
corre&s;ponds with what might be expected
from this circum&s;tance of identity or cogna|tion
in their original. The leading doctrine
of both epi&s;tles is the union of Jews and
Gentiles under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation;
and that doctrine in both is e&s;tabli&s;hed by
<PB N="210" REF="212">
the &s;ame arguments, or, more properly &s;peak|ing,
illu&s;trated by the &s;ame &s;imilitudes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul, I am apt to believe, has been &s;ometimes accu&s;ed of inconclu&s;ive rea&s;oning, by our mi&s;taking that for rea&s;oning which was only intended for illu&s;tration.

partial recollection of phra&s;es and &s;entences,

<P>The pa&s;&s;ages marked by Italics in the quo|tation

not only in &s;ignification but in terms,
to the quotation from the Colo&s;&s;ians. Both the
words and the order of the words are in many
clau&s;es a duplicate of one another. In the
epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are
laid together; in that to the Ephe&s;ians, they
are divided by intermediate matter, e&s;peci|ally
by a long digre&s;&s;ive allu&s;ion to the my&s;|terious
union between Chri&s;t and his church;
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as Mr. Locke hath well
ob&s;erved, the mind of the apo&s;tle, from
being an incidental thought, grows up into
the principal &s;ubject. The affinity between
the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages in &s;ignification, in terms,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
and in the order of the words, is clo&s;er than
can be pointed out between any parts of
any two epi&s;tles in the volume.</P>
<P>If the reader would &s;ee how the &s;ame
&s;ubject is treated by a different hand, and
how di&s;tingui&s;hable it is from the produc|tion
of the &s;ame pen, let him turn to the
&s;econd and third chapters of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle
of St. Peter. The duties of &s;ervants, of
wives and of hu&s;bands, are enlarged upon in
that epi&s;tle, as they are in the Epi&s;tle to the
Ephe&s;ians; but the &s;ubjects both occur in a
different order, and the train of &s;entiment
&s;ubjoined to each is totally unlike.</P>
<P>3. In two letters i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame
per&s;on, nearly at the &s;ame time, and upon
the &s;ame general occa&s;ion, we may expect
to trace the influence of a&s;&s;ociation in the
order in which the topics follow one ano|ther.
Certain ideas univer&s;ally or u&s;ually
&s;ugge&s;t others. Here the order is what we
call natural, and from &s;uch an order nothing
can be concluded. But when the order is
arbitrary, yet alike, the concurrence indi|cates
the effect of that principle, by which
ideas, which have been once joined, com|monly
<PB N="233" REF="235">
revi&s;it the thoughts together. The
epi&s;tles under con&s;ideration furni&s;h the two
following remarkable in&s;tances of this &s;pecies
of agreement.</P>
<P>Ephe&s;. ch. iv. ver. 24. "And that ye put
on the new man, which after God is
created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s;
wherefore, putting away lying, &s;peak every
man truth with his neighbour, for we are
members one of another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. ch. iv. ver. 24, 25. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Colo&s;. ch. iii. ver. 9. "Lie not one to
another; &s;eeing that ye have put off the
old man, with his deeds; and have put
on the new man, which is renewed in
knowledge<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;. ch. iii. ver. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE>."</P>
<P>The vice of "lying," or a correction of
that vice, does not &s;eem to bear any nearer
relation to the "putting on the new man,"
than a reformation in any other article of
<PB N="234" REF="236">
morals. Yet the&s;e two ideas, we &s;ee, &s;tand
in both epi&s;tles in immediate connection.</P>
<P>Ephe&s;. ch. v. ver. 20, 21. "Giving thanks
always for all things unto God and the
Father, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us
Chri&s;t; &s;ubmitting your&s;elves one to ano|ther,
in the fear of God. Wives, &s;ub|mit
your&s;elves unto your own hu&s;bands,
as unto the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. ch. v. ver. 20-22. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Colo&s;. ch. iii. ver. 17. "What&s;oever ye
do, in word or deed, do all in the name
of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks to God
and the Father by him. Wives, &s;ubmit
your&s;elves unto your own hu&s;bands, as it
is &s;it in the Lord<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colo&s;. ch. iii. ver. 17. <GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE>."</P>
<P>In both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion follows
giving of thanks, without any &s;imilitude in
the ideas which &s;hould account for the
tran&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="237">
It is not nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the compari|&s;on
between the two epi&s;tles farther. The
argument which re&s;ults from it &s;tands thus:
Now two other epi&s;tles contain a circum&s;tance
which indicates that they were written at
the &s;ame, or nearly at the &s;ame time. No
two other epi&s;tles exhibit &s;o many marks of
corre&s;pondency and re&s;emblance. If the
original which we a&s;cribe to the&s;e two epi|&s;tles
be the true one, that is, if they were
both really written by St. Paul, and both
&s;ent to their re&s;pective de&s;tination by the
&s;ame me&s;&s;enger, the &s;imilitude is, in all
points, what &s;hould be expected to take
place. If they were forgeries, then the
mention of Tychicus in both epi&s;tles, and
in a manner which &s;hews that he either
carried or accompanied both epi&s;tles, was
in&s;erted for the purpo&s;e of accounting for
their &s;imilitude; or el&s;e the &s;tructure of the
epi&s;tles was de&s;ignedly adapted to that cir|cum&s;tance;
or, la&s;tly, the conformity be|tween
the contents of the forgeries, and
what is thus indirectly intimated concerning
their date, was only a happy accident. Not
one of the&s;e three &s;uppo&s;itions will gain
<PB N="236" REF="238">
credit with a reader who peru&s;es the epi&s;tles
with attention, and who reviews the &s;everal
examples we have pointed out, and the ob|&s;ervations
with which they were accom|panied.</P>

<P>There is &s;uch a thing as a peculiar word
or phra&s;e cleaving, as it were, to the me|mory
of a writer or &s;peaker, and pre&s;enting
it&s;elf to his utterance at every turn. When
we ob&s;erve this, we call it a <HI>cant</HI> word, or
a <HI>cant</HI> phra&s;e. It is a natural effect of habit;
and would appear more frequently than it
does, had not the rules of good writing
taught the ear to be offended with the itera|tion
of the &s;ame &s;ound, and oftentimes cau&s;ed
us to reject, on that account, the word which
offered it&s;elf fir&s;t to our recollection. With
a writer who, like St. Paul, either knew not
the&s;e rules, or di&s;regarded them, &s;uch words
will not be avoided. The truth is, an ex|ample
of this kind runs through &s;everal
of his epi&s;tles, and in the epi&s;tle before us
<HI>abounds</HI>; and that is in the word <HI>riches</HI>
(<GAP DESC="foreign">), u&s;ed metaphorically as an aug|mentative
<PB N="237" REF="239">
of the idea to which it happens
to be &s;ubjoined. Thus, "the <HI>riches</HI> of his
glory," "his <HI>riches</HI> in glory," "<HI>riches</HI> of the
glory of his inheritance," "<HI>riches</HI> of the
glory of this my&s;tery," Rom. ch. ix. ver. 23,
Ephe&s;. ch. iii. ver. 16, Ephe&s;. ch. i. ver. 18,
Colo&s;. ch. i. ver. 27; "<HI>riches</HI> of his grace,"
twice in the Ephe&s;ians, ch. i. ver. 7, and ch.
ii. ver. 7; "<HI>riches</HI> of the full a&s;&s;urance of
under&s;tanding," Colo&s;. ch. ii. ver. 2; "<HI>riches</HI>

of the wi&s;dom of God," Rom. ch. xi.
ver. 33; "<HI>riches</HI> of Chri&s;t," Ephe&s;. ch. iii.
ver. 8. In a like &s;en&s;e the adjective, Rom.
ch. x. ver. 12, "<HI>rich</HI> unto all that call upon
him;" Ephe&s;. ch. ii. ver. 4, "<HI>rich</HI> in mer|cy;"

works." Al&s;o the adverb, Colo&s;. ch. iii.

you <HI>richly.</HI>" This figurative u&s;e of the word,
though &s;o familiar to St. Paul, does not oc|cur
in any part of the New Te&s;tament, ex|cept
once in the epi&s;tle of St. James, ch. ii.

<P>There is another &s;ingularity in St. Paul's
&s;tyle, which, wherever it is found, may be
deemed a badge of authenticity; becau&s;e, if
it were noticed, it would not, I think, be
imitated, ina&s;much as it almo&s;t always pro|duces
embarra&s;&s;ment and interruption in the
rea&s;oning. This &s;ingularity is a &s;pecies of
digre&s;&s;ion which may properly, I think, be
denominated <HI>going off at a word.</HI> It is
turning a&s;ide from the &s;ubject upon the oc|currence
of &s;ome particular word, for&s;aking
the train of thought then in hand, and en|tering
upon a parenthetic &s;entence in which
that word is the prevailing term. I &s;hall
lay before the reader &s;ome examples of this,
collected from the other epi&s;tles, and then
propo&s;e two examples of it which are found
in the epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians. 2 Cor. ch.
ii. ver. 14, at the word <HI>&s;avour</HI>: "Now
thanks be unto God, which always cau&s;eth
us to triumph in Chri&s;t, and maketh ma|nife&s;t
<PB N="239" REF="241">
the <HI>&s;avour</HI> of his knowledge by us
in every place (for we are unto God a
&s;weet <HI>&s;avour</HI> of Chri&s;t, in them that are
&s;aved, and in them that peri&s;h; to the
one we are the <HI>&s;avour</HI> of death unto death,
and to the other the <HI>&s;avour</HI> of life unto
life; and who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?)
For we are not as many which corrupt the
word of God, but as of &s;incerity, but as
of God; in the &s;ight of God &s;peak we in
Chri&s;t." Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 1, at
the word <HI>epi&s;tle</HI>: "Need we, as &s;ome others,
<HI>epi&s;tles</HI> of commendation to you, or of
commendation from you? (ye are our
<HI>epi&s;tle,</HI> written in our hearts, known and
read of all men; fora&s;much as ye are ma|nife&s;tly
declared to be the <HI>epi&s;tle</HI> of Chri&s;t,
mini&s;tered by us, written not with ink,
but with the &s;pirit of the living God; not
in tables of &s;tone, but in the fle&s;hly tables
of the heart." The po&s;ition of the words
in the original, &s;hews more &s;trongly than
in the tran&s;lation that it was the occurrence
of the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> which gave birth to
the &s;entence that follows: 2 Cor. chap. iii.
ver. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="242">
Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 12, &amp;c. at the
word <HI>vail</HI>: "Seeing then that we have &s;uch
hope, we u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech:
and not as Mo&s;es, which put a <HI>vail</HI> over
his face, that the children of I&s;rael could
not &s;tedfa&s;tly look to the end of that
which is aboli&s;hed. But their minds were
blinded; for until this day remaineth the
&s;ame <HI>vail</HI> untaken away in the reading of
the Old Te&s;tament, which <HI>vail</HI> is done
away in Chri&s;t; but even unto this day,
when Mo&s;es is read, the <HI>vail</HI> is upon their
heart: neverthele&s;s, when it &s;hall turn to
the Lord, the <HI>vail</HI> &s;hall be taken away
(now the Lord is that &s;pirit; and where
the &s;pirit of the Lord is, there is liberty).
But we all, with open face, beholding as
in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are
<PB N="241" REF="243">
changed into the &s;ame image from glory
to glory, even as by the &s;pirit of the Lord.
Therefore, &s;eeing we have this mini&s;try, as
we have received mercy, we faint not."</P>
<P>Who &s;ees not that this whole allegory of
the <HI>vail</HI> ari&s;es entirely out of the occurrence
of the word, in telling us that "Mo&s;es put
a <HI>vail</HI> over his face," and that it drew the
apo&s;tle away from the proper &s;ubject of his
di&s;cour&s;e, the dignity of the office in which
he was engaged: which &s;ubject he fetches
up again almo&s;t in the words, with which
he had left it; "therefore, &s;eeing we have
this mini&s;try, as we have received mercy,
we faint not?" The &s;entence which he
had before been going on with, and in which
he had been interrupted by the <HI>vail,</HI> was,
"&s;eeing then that we have &s;uch hope, we
u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech."</P>
<P>In the epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, the reader
will remark two in&s;tances, in which the &s;ame
habit of compo&s;ition obtains; he will re|cognize
the &s;ame pen. One he will find,
chap. iv. ver. 8-11, at the word <HI>a&s;cended</HI>:
"Wherefore he &s;aith, When he <HI>a&s;cended</HI> up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
<PB N="242" REF="244">
gifts unto men. (Now that he <HI>a&s;cended,</HI>
what is it but that he al&s;o de&s;cended fir&s;t
unto the lower parts of the earth? He
that de&s;cended is the &s;ame al&s;o that <HI>a&s;cended</HI>
up far above all heavens, that he might
fill all things). And he gave &s;ome, apo|&s;tles,"
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The other appears, chap. v. ver. 12-15,
at the word <HI>light</HI>: "For it is a &s;hame even
to &s;peak of tho&s;e things which are done
of them in &s;ecret: but all things that are
reproved, are made manife&s;t by the <HI>light</HI>;
(for what&s;oever doth make manife&s;t, is
<HI>light</HI>; wherefore he &s;aith, Awake, thou
that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the dead, and
Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee <HI>light</HI>:) &s;ee then that

Marcion, a heretic of the &s;econd century,
as quoted by Tertullian, a father in the
beginning of the third, calls it the epi&s;tle to
the Laodiceans. From what we know of
Marcion, his judgment is little to be relied
upon; nor is it perfectly clear that Marcion
was rightly under&s;tood by Tertullian. If,
however, Marcion be brought to prove that
&s;ome copies in his time gave <GAP DESC="foreign">
in the &s;uper&s;cription, his te&s;timony, if it be
truly interpreted, is not dimini&s;hed by his
here&s;y; for, as Grotius ob&s;erves, "<HI>cur in e&acirc;
re mentiretur nihil erat cau&s;ae.</HI>" The name
<GAP DESC="foreign">, in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, upon which
word &s;ingly depends the proof that the
epi&s;tle was written to the Ephe&s;ians, is not
read in all the manu&s;cripts now extant. I
admit, however, that the external evidence
preponderates with a manife&s;t exce&s;s on the
&s;ide of the received reading. The objection
therefore principally ari&s;es from the contents
of the epi&s;tle it&s;elf, which, in many re&s;pects,
militate with the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was
written to the church of Ephe&s;us. Accord|ing
to the hi&s;tory, St. Paul had pa&s;&s;ed two
<PB N="244" REF="246">
whole years at Ephe&s;us, Acts, chap. xix.
ver. 10. And in this point, viz. of St. Paul
having preached for a con&s;iderable length of
time at Ephe&s;us, the hi&s;tory is confirmed by
the two epi&s;tles to the Corinthians, and by
the two epi&s;tles to Timothy: "I will tarry
at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> until Penteco&s;t," 1 Cor. chap. xvi.
ver. 8. "We would not have you ignorant
of our trouble which came to us in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>"
2 Cor. chap. i. ver. 8; "As I be&s;ought thee
to abide &s;till at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> when I went into
Macedonia," 1 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3. "And
in how many things he mini&s;tered to me
at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> thou knowe&s;t well," 2 Tim.
chap. i. ver. 18. I adduce the&s;e te&s;timonies,
becau&s;e, had it been a competition of credit
between the hi&s;tory and the epi&s;tle, I &s;hould
have thought my&s;elf bound to have prefer|red
the epi&s;tle. Now, every epi&s;tle which
St. Paul wrote to churches, which he him|&s;elf
had founded, or which he had vi&s;ited,
abounds with references, and appeals to what
had pa&s;&s;ed during the time that he was pre|&s;ent
among&s;t them; whereas there is not a
text in the epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, from
which we can collect that he had ever been
<PB N="245" REF="247">
at Ephe&s;us at all. The two epi&s;tles to the
Corinthians, the epi&s;tle to the Galatians, the
epi&s;tle to the Philippians, and the two epi|&s;tles
to the The&s;&s;alonians, are of this cla&s;s;
and they are full of allu&s;ions to the apo&s;tle's
hi&s;tory, his reception, and his conduct, whil&s;t
among&s;t them; the total want of which, in
the epi&s;tle before us, is very difficult to ac|count
for, if it was in truth written to the
church of Ephe&s;us, in which city he had
re&s;ided for &s;o long a time. This is the fir&s;t
and &s;tronge&s;t objection. But farther, the
epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians was addre&s;&s;ed to a
church, in which St. Paul had never been.
This we infer from the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the &s;e|cond
chapter: "For I would that ye knew
what great conflict I have for you and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have
not &s;een my face in the fle&s;h." There
could be no propriety in thus joining the
Colo&s;&s;ians and Laodiceans with tho&s;e "who
had not &s;een his face in the fle&s;h," if they
did not al&s;o belong to the &s;ame de&s;cription<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lardner contends again&s;t the validity of this conclu&s;ion; but, I think, without &s;ucce&s;s. LARDNER, Vol. XIV. p. 473, edit. 1757.</NOTE>.
<PB N="246" REF="248">
Now, his addre&s;s to the Colo&s;&s;ians, whom
he had not-vi&s;ited, is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as
his addre&s;s to the Chri&s;tians, to whom he
wrote in the epi&s;tle, which we are now con|&s;idering:
"We give thanks to God and the
Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, praying
always for you, <HI>&s;ince we heard of your faith</HI>
in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and of the love which ye
have to all the &s;aints," Col. chap. i. ver. 3.
Thus he &s;peaks to the Colo&s;&s;ians, in the
epi&s;tle before us, as follows: "Wherefore I
al&s;o, <HI>after I heard of your faith</HI> in the Lord
Je&s;us, and love unto all the &s;aints, cea&s;e
not to give thanks for you in my prayers,"
chap. i. ver. 15. The terms of this addre&s;s
are ob&s;ervable. The words "having <HI>heard</HI>
of your faith and love," are the very words,
we &s;ee, which he u&s;es towards &s;trangers;
and it is not probable that he &s;hould em|ploy
the &s;ame in acco&s;ting a church in which
he had long exerci&s;ed his mini&s;try, and who&s;e
"faith and love" he mu&s;t have per&s;onally
known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Locke endeavours to avoid this difficulty, by explaining "<HI>their faith,</HI> of which St. Paul had heard," to mean the &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s of their per&s;ua&s;ion that they were called into the kingdom of God, without &s;ubjection to the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution. But this interpretation &s;eems to me extremely <HI>hard</HI>; for, in the manner in which faith is here joined with love, in the expre&s;&s;ion, "your faith and love," it could not be meant to denote any particu|lar tenet which di&s;tingui&s;hed one &s;et of Chri&s;tians from others; fora&s;much as the expre&s;&s;ion de&s;cribes the general virtues of the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. Vide LOCKE in loc.</NOTE>. The epi&s;tle to the Romans was
<PB N="247" REF="249">
written before St. Paul had been at Rome;
and his addre&s;s to them runs in the &s;ame
&s;train with that ju&s;t now quoted: "I thank
my God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for you
all, that your faith is <HI>&s;poken of</HI> throughout
the whole world," Rom. chap. i. ver. 8.
Let us now &s;ee what was the form in which
our apo&s;tle was accu&s;tomed to introduce his
epi&s;tles, when he wrote to tho&s;e with whom
he was already acquainted. To the Corin|thians
it was this: "I thank my God al|ways
on your behalf, for the grace of
God which is given you by Chri&s;t Je&s;us,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4. To the Philippians:
"I thank my God upon every remembrance
of you," Phil. chap. i. ver. 3. To the The&s;|&s;alonians:
"We give thanks to God always
for you all, making mention of you in
<PB N="248" REF="250">
our prayers, remembering without cea&s;ing
your work of faith, and labour of love,"
1 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver. 3. To Timothy:
"I thank God, whom I &s;erve from my fore|fathers
with pure con&s;cience, that without
cea&s;ing I have remembrance of thee in
my prayers night and day," 2 Tim. chap.
i. ver. 4. In the&s;e quotations, it is u&s;ually
his <HI>remembrance,</HI> and never his <HI>hearing</HI> of
them, which he makes the &s;ubject of his
thankfulne&s;s to God.</P>
<P>As great difficulties &s;tand in the way of
&s;uppo&s;ing the epi&s;tle before us to have been
written to the church of Ephe&s;us, &s;o I think
it probable that it is actually the epi&s;tle to
the Laodiceans, referred to in the fourth
chapter of the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians. The
text which contains that reference is this:
"When this epi&s;tle is read among you, cau&s;e
that it be read al&s;o in the church of the
Laodiceans, and that ye likewi&s;e read the
epi&s;tle from Laodicea," chap. iv. ver. 16.
The "epi&s;tle <HI>from</HI> Laodicea" was an epi&s;tle
&s;ent by St. Paul to that church, and by them
tran&s;mitted to Colo&s;&s;e. The two churches
were mutually to communicate the epi&s;tles
<PB N="249" REF="251">
they had received. This is the way in
which the direction is explained by the
greater part of commentators, and is the
mo&s;t probable &s;en&s;e that can be given to it.
It is al&s;o probable that the epi&s;tle alluded to
was an epi&s;tle which had been received by
the church of Laodicea <HI>lately.</HI> It appears
then, with a con&s;iderable degree of evidence,
that there exi&s;ted an epi&s;tle of St. Paul's
nearly of the &s;ame date with the epi&s;tle to
the Colo&s;&s;ians, and an epi&s;tle directed to a
church (for &s;uch the church of Laodicea
was) in which St. Paul had never been.
What has been ob&s;erved concerning the
epi&s;tle before us, &s;hews that it an&s;wers per|fectly
to that character.</P>
<P>Nor does the mi&s;take &s;eem very difficult
to account for. Whoever in&s;pects the map
of A&s;ia Minor will &s;ee, that a per&s;on pro|ceeding
from Rome to Laodicea would pro|bably
land at Ephe&s;us, as the neare&s;t fre|quented
&s;ea-port in that direction. Might
not Tychicus then, in pa&s;&s;ing through Ephe|&s;us,
communicate to the Chri&s;tians of that
place the letter, with which he was charged?
And might not copies of that letter be mul|tiplied
<PB N="250" REF="252">
and pre&s;erved at Ephe&s;us? Might not
&s;ome of the copies drop the words of de|&s;ignation
<GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And it is remarkable that there &s;eem to have been &s;ome ancient copies without the words of de&s;ignation, either the words <HI>in Ephe&s;us,</HI> or the words <HI>in Laodicea.</HI> St. Ba&s;il, a writer of the fourth century, &s;peaking of the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, has this very &s;ingular pa&s;&s;age: "And writing to the Ephe&s;ians, as truly united to him who is through knowledge, he (Paul) calleth them in a peculiar &s;en&s;e <HI>&s;uch who are</HI>; &s;aying, <HI>to the &s;aints who are, and</HI> (or <HI>even</HI>) <HI>the faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>; for &s;o tho&s;e before us have tran&s;mitted it, and we have found it in ancient copies." Dr. Mill interprets (and, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome objections that have been made to him, in my opinion rightly interprets) the&s;e words of Ba&s;il, as de|claring that this father had &s;een certain copies of the epi&s;tle in which the words "in Ephe&s;us" were wanting. And the pa&s;&s;age, I think, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as Ba&s;il's fanciful way of explaining what was really a corrupt and defective reading; for I do not believe it po&s;&s;ible that the author of the epi&s;tle could have originally written <GAP DESC="foreign">, without any name of place to follow it.</NOTE>, which it was of
no con&s;equence to an Ephe&s;ian to retain?
Might not copies of the letter come out into
the Chri&s;tian church at large from Ephe&s;us;
and might not this give occa&s;ion to a belief
that the letter was written to that church?
And, la&s;tly, might not this belief produce

the error which we &s;uppo&s;e to have crept
into the in&s;cription?</P>

<P>As our epi&s;tle purports to have been writ|ten
during St. Paul's impri&s;onment at Rome,
which lies beyond the period, to which the
Acts of the Apo&s;tles brings up his hi&s;tory;
and as we have &s;een and acknowledged that
the epi&s;tle contains no reference to any
tran&s;action at Ephe&s;us during the apo&s;tle's
re&s;idence in that city, we cannot expect that
it &s;hould &s;upply many marks of agreement
with the narrative. One coincidence how|ever
occurs, and a coincidence of that mi|nute
and le&s;s obvious kind, which, as hath
been repeetedly ob&s;erved, is of all others the
mo&s;t to be relied upon.</P>
<P>Chap. vi. ver. 19, 20, we read, "praying
for me, that I may open my mouth boldly
to make known the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel,
for which I am an amba&s;&s;ador in bonds."
"<HI>In bonds,</HI>" <GAP DESC="foreign">, in a <HI>chain.</HI> In the
twenty-eighth chapter of the Acts we are in|formed,
that Paul, after his arrival at Rome,
was &s;uffered to dwell by him&s;elf with a &s;oldier,
<PB N="252" REF="254">
that kept him. Dr. Lardner has &s;hewn that
this mode of cu&s;tody was in u&s;e among&s;t
the Romans, and that whenever it was
adopted the pri&s;oner was bound to the &s;oldier
by a &s;ingle chain; in reference to which
St. Paul, in the twentieth ver&s;e of this chap|ter,
tells the Jews, whom he had a&s;&s;embled,
"For this cau&s;e therefore have I called for
you to &s;ee you, and to &s;peak with you,
becau&s;e that for the hope of I&s;rael I am
bound <HI>with this chain,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign">. It is in exact conformity there|fore
with the truth of St. Paul's &s;ituation at
the time, that he declares of him&s;elf in the
epi&s;tle, <GAP DESC="foreign">. And the exactne&s;s
is the more remarkable, as <GAP DESC="foreign"> (a chain)
is no where u&s;ed in the &s;ingular number to
expre&s;s any other kind of cu&s;tody. When
the pri&s;oner's hands or feet were bound to|gether,
the word was <GAP DESC="foreign"> (bonds), as in
the twenty-&s;ixth chapter of the Acts, where
Paul replies to Agrippa, "I would to God
that not only thou, but al&s;o all that hear me
this day, were both almo&s;t, and altogether
&s;uch as I am, except <HI>the&s;e bonds,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign">. When the pri&s;oner
<PB N="253" REF="255">
was confined between two &s;oldiers, as in the
ca&s;e of Peter, Acts, chap. xii. ver. 6, two
chains were employed; and it is &s;aid, upon
his miraculous deliverance, that the "chains"
(<GAP DESC="foreign">, in the plural) "fell from his hands."
<GAP DESC="foreign"> the noun, and <GAP DESC="foreign"> the verb,
being general terms, were applicable to this
in common with any other &s;pecies of per|&s;onal
coercion; but <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the &s;ingular
number, to none but this.</P>
<P>If it can be &s;u&s;pected that the writer of
the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, who, in no other parti|cular,
appears to have availed him&s;elf of the
information concerning St. Paul delivered in
the Acts, had, in this ver&s;e, borrowed the
word, which he read in that book, and had
adapted his expre&s;&s;ion to what he found
there recorded of St. Paul's treatment at
Rome; in &s;hort, that the coincidence here
noted was effected by craft and de&s;ign; I
think it a &s;trong reply to remark, that, in
the parallel pa&s;&s;age of the epi&s;tle to the Co|lo&s;&s;ians,
the &s;ame allu&s;ion is not pre&s;erved:
the words there are, "praying al&s;o for us,
that God would open unto us a door of
utterance to &s;peak the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="254" REF="256">
for which <HI>I am al&s;o in bonds,</HI>"
<GAP DESC="foreign">. After what has been &s;hewn in a
preceding number, there can be little doubt
but that the&s;e two epi&s;tles were written by
the &s;ame per&s;on. If the writer, therefore,
&s;ought for, and fraudulently in&s;erted, the
corre&s;pondency into one epi&s;tle, why did
he not do it in the other? A real pri&s;oner
might u&s;e either general words, which com|prehended
this among&s;t many other modes
of cu&s;tody; or might u&s;e appropriate words
which &s;pecified this, and di&s;tingui&s;hed it
from any other mode. It would be acci|dental
which form of expre&s;&s;ion he fell upon.
But an impo&s;tor, who had the art, in one
place, to employ the appropriate term for
the purpo&s;e of fraud, would have u&s;ed it
in both places.</P>

The account of Epaphroditus, in the
epi&s;tle to the Philippians, of his journey to
Rome, and of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which brought
him thither, is the article to which I mean
to apply this ob&s;ervation. There are three
pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tle, which relate to this
&s;ubject. The fir&s;t, chap. i. ver. 7, "Even
as it is meet for me to think this of you
all, becau&s;e I have you in my heart, ina&s;|much
as both in my bonds, and in the

He inter|prets in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e the phra&s;e in the fifth ver&s;e, which our tran&s;lation renders, "your fellow&s;hip in the go&s;pel;" but which in the original is not <GAP DESC="foreign">, or, <GAP DESC="foreign">; but <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>."
Nothing more is &s;aid in this
place. In the latter part of the &s;econd chap|ter,
and at the di&s;tance of half the epi&s;tle
from the la&s;t quotation, the &s;ubject appears
again: "Yet I &s;uppo&s;ed it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end
to you Epaphroditus, my brother and
companion in labour, and fellow &s;oldier,
<PB N="257" REF="259">
but your me&s;&s;enger, and <HI>he that mini&s;tered
to my wants</HI>: for he longed after you all,
and was full of heavine&s;s, becau&s;e that ye
had heard that he had been &s;ick: for indeed
he was &s;ick nigh unto death; but God
had mercy on him, and not on him only,
but on me al&s;o, le&s;t I &s;hould have &s;orrow
upon &s;orrow. I &s;ent him therefore the
more carefully, that when ye &s;ee him
again ye may rejoice, and that I may be
the le&s;s &s;orrowful. Receive him therefore
in the Lord with all gladne&s;s; and hold
&s;uch in reputation: becau&s;e for the work
of Chri&s;t he was nigh unto death, not re|garding
his life <HI>to &s;upply your lack of &s;ervice
toward me.</HI>" Chap. ii. ver. 25-30. The
matter is here dropped, and no farther
mention made of it till it is taken up near
the conclu&s;ion of the epi&s;tle as follows:
"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that
now at the la&s;t your care of me hath
flouri&s;hed again; wherein ye were al&s;o
careful, but ye lacked opportunity: not
that I &s;peak in re&s;pect of want; for I have
learned in what&s;oever &s;tate I am, there|with
to be content. I know both how to
<PB N="258" REF="260">
be aba&s;ed, and I know how to abound;
every where and in all things I am in|&s;tructed
both to be full and to be hungry,
both to abound and to &s;uffer need. I
can do all things through Chri&s;t which
&s;trengtheneth me. Notwith&s;tanding ye
have well done that ye did communicate
with my affliction. Now ye, Philippians,
know al&s;o that in the beginning of the
go&s;pel, when I departed from Macedonia,
no church communicated with me as con|cerning
giving and receiving, but ye only:
for even in The&s;&s;alonica ye &s;ent once
and again unto my nece&s;&s;ity: not becau&s;e
I de&s;ire a gift; but I de&s;ire fruit that may
abound to your account. But I have all,
and abound; I am full, having received
of Epaphroditus the things which were
&s;ent from you." Chap. iv. ver. 10-18.
To the Philippian reader, who knew that
contributions were wont to be made in that
church for the apo&s;tle's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and re|lief,
that the &s;upply which they were ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;end to him had been delayed
by the want of opportunity, that Epaphrodi|tus
had undertaken the charge of conveying
<PB N="259" REF="261">
their liberality to the hands of the apo&s;tle,
that he had acquitted him&s;elf of this com|mi&s;&s;ion
at the peril of his life, by ha&s;tening
to Rome under the oppre&s;&s;ion of a grievous
&s;ickne&s;s; to a reader who knew all this
beforehand, every line in the above quota|tions
would be plain and clear. But how
is it with a &s;tranger? The knowledge of
the&s;e &s;everal particulars is nece&s;&s;ary to the
perception and explanation of the references;
yet that knowledge mu&s;t be gathered from
a compari&s;on of pa&s;&s;ages lying at a great
di&s;tance from one another. Texts mu&s;t be
interpreted by texts long &s;ub&s;equent to them,
which nece&s;&s;arily produces embarra&s;&s;ment
and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The pa&s;&s;age quoted from the
beginning of the epi&s;tle contains an ac|knowledgment,
on the part of the apo&s;tle,
of the liberality which the Philippians had
exerci&s;ed towards him; but the allu&s;ion
is &s;o general and indeterminate, that had
nothing more been &s;aid in the &s;equel of
the epi&s;tle, it would hardly have been
applied to this occa&s;ion at all. In the &s;e|cond
quotation, Epaphroditus is declared
to have "mini&s;tered to the apo&s;tle's wants,"
<PB N="260" REF="262">
and "to have &s;upplied their lack of &s;ervice
towards him:" but <HI>how,</HI> that is, at who&s;e
expence, or from what fund, he "mini&s;tered,"
or what was the "lack of &s;ervice" which
he &s;upplied, are left very much unexplained,
till we arrive at the third quotation, where
we find that Epaphroditus "mini&s;tered to
St. Paul's wants," only by conveying to
his hands the contributions of the Philip|pians;
"I am full, having received of Epa|phroditus
the things which were &s;ent from
you:" and that "the lack of &s;ervice
which he &s;upplied" was a delay or inter|ruption
of their accu&s;tomed bounty, occa|&s;ioned
by the want of opportunity; "I re|joiced
in the Lord greatly, that now at
the la&s;t your care of me hath flouri&s;hed
again; wherein ye were al&s;o careful, but ye
lacked opportunity." The affair at length
comes out clear; but it comes out by piece|meal.
The clearne&s;s is the re&s;ult of the re|ciprocal
illu&s;tration of divided texts. Should
any one choo&s;e therefore to in&s;inuate, that
this whole &s;tory of Epaphroditus, of his
journey, his errand, his &s;ickne&s;s, or even
his exi&s;tence, might, for what we know,
<PB N="261" REF="263">
have no other foundation than in the in|vention

that a forger would have &s;et forth his
&s;tory connectedly, and al&s;o more fully and
more per&s;picuou&s;ly. If the epi&s;tle be authen|tic,
and the tran&s;action real, then every thing
which is &s;aid concerning Epaphroditus and
his commi&s;&s;ion, would be clear to tho&s;e into
who&s;e hands the epi&s;tle was expected to
come. Con&s;idering the Philippians as his
readers, a per&s;on might naturally write upon
the &s;ubject, as the author of the epi&s;tle has
written; but there is no &s;uppo&s;ition of for|gery
with which it will &s;uit.</P>

<P>The hi&s;tory of Epaphroditus &s;upplies an|other
ob&s;ervation: "Indeed he was &s;ick,
nigh unto death; but God had mercy on
him, and not on him only, but on me
al&s;o, le&s;t I &s;hould have &s;orrow upon &s;or|row."
In this pa&s;&s;age, no intimation is
given that Epaphroditus's recovery was mi|raculous.
It is plainly, I think, &s;poken of
as a natural event. This in&s;tance, together
<PB N="262" REF="264">
with one in the &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy
("Trophimus have I left at Miletum &s;ick"),
affords a proof that the power of perform|ing
cures, and, by parity of rea&s;on, of
working other miracles, was a power which
only vi&s;ited the apo&s;tles occa&s;ionally, and
did not at all depend upon their own will.
Paul undoubtedly would have healed Epa|phroditus
if he could. Nor, if the power
of working cures had awaited his di&s;po&s;al,
would he have left his fellow traveller at
Miletum &s;ick. This, I think, is a fair ob|&s;ervation
upon the in&s;tances adduced; but
it is not the ob&s;ervation I am concerned
to make. It is more for the purpo&s;e of my
argument to remark, that forgery, upon
&s;uch an occa&s;ion, would not have &s;pared a
miracle; much le&s;s would it have intro|duced
St. Paul profe&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t anxiety
for the &s;afety of his friend, yet acknow|ledging
him&s;elf unable to help him: which
he does almo&s;t expre&s;sly, in the ca&s;e of
Trophimus, for he "left him &s;ick;" and
virtually in the pa&s;&s;age before us, in which
he felicitates him&s;elf upon the recovery of
Epaphroditus, in terms which almo&s;t ex|clude
<PB N="263" REF="265">
the &s;uppo&s;ition of any &s;upernatural
means being employed to effect it. This

the pa&s;&s;age, &s;o as to mark the&s;e different pe|riods,
thus: "Now ye, Philippians, know al&s;o
that in the beginning of the go&s;pel, when
I was departed from Macedonia, no church
communicated with me as concerning giv|ing
and receiving, but ye only; and that
al&s;o in The&s;&s;alonica ye &s;ent once and again

of the pa&s;&s;age compare 2 Cor. chap.
xi. ver. 8, 9: "I robbed other churches,
<PB N="265" REF="267">
taking wages of them to do you &s;ervice:
and when I was pre&s;ent with you and
wanted, I was chargeable to no man; for
that which was lacking to me the bre|thren
which came from Macedonia &s;up|plied."</P>
<P>It appears from St. Paul's hi&s;tory, as re|lated
in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, that upon
leaving Macedonia he pa&s;&s;ed, after a very
&s;hort &s;tay at Athens, into Achaia. It ap|pears,
&s;econdly, from the quotation out of
the epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, that in Achaia
he accepted no pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the
converts of that country; but that he drew
a &s;upply for his wants from the Macedo|nian
Chri&s;tians. Agreeably whereunto it
appears, in the third place, from the text
which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent number,
that the brethren in Philippi, a city of Ma|cedonia,
had followed him with their muni|ficence,
<GAP DESC="foreign">, when he
was departed from Macedonia, that is, when
he was <HI>come into Achaia.</HI></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration affords
another circum&s;tance of agreement de&s;erving
of our notice. The gift alluded to in the epi&s;tle
<PB N="266" REF="268">
to the Philippians is &s;tated to have been
made "in the beginning of the go&s;pel."
This phra&s;e is mo&s;t naturally explained to
&s;ignify the fir&s;t preaching of the go&s;pel in
the&s;e parts; viz. on that &s;ide of the Aegean
&s;ea. The &s;uccours referred to in the epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, as received from Mace|donia,
are &s;tated to have been received by
him upon his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the penin&s;ula of
Greece. The dates therefore a&s;&s;igned to the
donation in the two epi&s;tles agree; yet is
the date in one a&s;certained very incident|ally,
namely, by the con&s;iderations which
fix the date of the epi&s;tle it&s;elf; and in the
other, by an expre&s;&s;ion ("the beginning of
the go&s;pel") much too general to have
been u&s;ed, if the text had been penned with
any view to the corre&s;pondency we are re|marking.</P>
<P>Farther, the phra&s;e, "in the <HI>beginning</HI> of
the go&s;pel," rai&s;es an idea in the reader's
mind, that the go&s;pel had been preached
there more than once. The writer would
hardly have called the vi&s;it to which he
refers the "beginning of the go&s;pel," if he
had not al&s;o vi&s;ited them in &s;ome other &s;tage
<PB N="267" REF="269">
of it. The fact corre&s;ponds with this idea.
If we con&s;ult the &s;ixteenth and twentieth
chapters of the Acts, we &s;hall find, that St.
Paul, before his impri&s;onment at Rome,
during which this epi&s;tle purports to have
been written, had been <HI>twice</HI> in Macedonia,
and each time at Philippi.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>That Timothy had been alongwith St. Paul
at Philippi is a fact which &s;eems to be im|plied
in this epi&s;tle twice. Fir&s;t, he joins in
the &s;alutation with which the epi&s;tle opens,
"Paul and Timotheus, the &s;ervants of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, to all the &s;aints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us which
are at Philippi." Secondly, and more di|rectly,
the point is inferred from what is &s;aid
concerning him, chap. ii. ver. 19: "But
I tru&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us to &s;end Timo|theus
&s;hortly unto you, that I al&s;o may
be of good comfort when I know your
&s;tate; for I have no man like minded,
who will naturally care for your &s;tate;
for all &s;eek their own, not the things
<PB N="268" REF="270">
which are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's: but <HI>ye know the
proof of him,</HI> that as a &s;on with the father,
he hath &s;erved with me in the go&s;pel."
Had Timothy's pre&s;ence with St. Paul at
Philippi, when he preached the go&s;pel there,
been expre&s;sly remarked in the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles, this quotation might be thought
to contain a contrived adaptation to the hi&s;|tory;
although, even in that ca&s;e, the aver|ment,
or rather the allu&s;ion in the epi&s;tle,
is too oblique to afford much room for &s;uch
&s;u&s;picion. But the truth is, that in the hi&s;|tory
of St. Paul's tran&s;actions at Philippi,
which occupies the greate&s;t part of the
&s;ixteenth chapter of the Acts, no mention
is made of Timothy at all. What appears
concerning Timothy in the hi&s;tory, &s;o far
as relates to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, is this:
"When Paul came to Derbe and Ly&s;tra,
behold a certain di&s;ciple was there named
Timotheus, whom Paul would have to go
forth with him." The narrative then
proceeds with the account of St. Paul's pro|gre&s;s
through various provinces of the Le&s;&s;er
A&s;ia, till it brings him down to Troas. At
Troas he was warned in a vi&s;ion to pa&s;s
<PB N="269" REF="271">
over into Macedonia. In obedience to which
he cro&s;&s;ed the Aegean &s;ea to Samothracia,
the next day to Neapolis, and from thence
to Philippi. His preaching, miracles, and
perfecutions at Philippi follow next; after
which Paul and his company, when they
had pa&s;&s;ed through Amphipolis and Apol|lonia,
came to The&s;&s;alonica, and from The&s;|&s;alonica
to Beraea. From Beraea the bre|thren
&s;ent away Paul; "but Silas and
"<HI>Timotheus</HI> abode there &s;till." he iti|nerary,
of which the above is an ab&s;tract,
is undoubtedly &s;ufficient to &s;upport an in|ference
that Timothy was along with St.
Paul at Philippi. We find them &s;etting out
together upon this progre&s;s from Derbe, in
Lycaonia; we find them together, near the
conclu&s;ion of it, at Beraea, in Macedonia.
It is highly probable, therefore, that they
came together to Philippi, through which
their route between the&s;e two places lay.
If this be thought probable, it is &s;ufficient.
For what I wi&s;h to be ob&s;erved is, that in
comparing, upon this &s;ubject, the epi&s;tle
with the hi&s;tory, we do not find a recital in
one place of what is related in another;
<PB N="270" REF="272">
but that we find, what is much more to be
relied upon, an oblique allu&s;ion to an im|plied
fact.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. V.</HEAD>
<P>Our epi&s;tle purports to have been written
near the conclu&s;ion of St. Paul's impri&s;on|ment
at Rome, and after a re&s;idence in that
city of con&s;iderable duration. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
are made out by different inti|mations,
and the intimations upon the &s;ub|ject
pre&s;erve among them&s;elves a ju&s;t con|&s;i&s;tency,
and a con&s;i&s;tency certainly unme|ditated.
Fir&s;t, the apo&s;tle had already been
a pri&s;oner at Rome &s;o long, as that the re|putation
of his bonds, and of his con&s;tancy
under them, had contributed to advance the
&s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel: "But I would ye
&s;hould under&s;tand, brethren, that the things
which happened unto me have fallen out
rather unto the furtherance of the go&s;pel;
&s;o that my bonds in Chri&s;t are manife&s;t in
all the palace, and in all other places; and
many of the brethren in the Lord waxing
con&s;ident by my bonds, are much more
<PB N="271" REF="273">
bold to &s;peak the word without fear."
Secondly, the account given of Epaphrodi|tus
imports, that St. Paul, when he wrote the
epi&s;tle, had been in Rome a con&s;iderable
time: "He longed after you all, and was
full of heavine&s;s, becau&s;e that ye had
heard that he had been &s;ick." Epaphro|ditus
was with St. Paul at Rome. He had
been &s;ick. The Philippians had heard of his
&s;ickne&s;s, and he again had received an ac|count
how much they had been affected by
the intelligence. The pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing
of the&s;e advices mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have occu|pied
a large portion of time, and mu&s;t have
all taken place during St. Paul's re&s;idence at
Rome. Thirdly, after a re&s;idence at Rome
thus proved to have been of con&s;iderable
duration, he now regards the deci&s;ion of his
fate as nigh at hand. He contemplates ei|ther
alternative, that of his deliverance,
ch. ii. ver. 23, "Him therefore (Timothy) I
hope to &s;end <HI>pre&s;ently,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as I &s;hall &s;ee
how it will go with me; but I tru&s;t in the
Lord that I al&s;o my&s;elf &s;hall come &s;hortly:"
that of his condemnation, ver. 17, "Yea, and
<PB N="272" REF="274">
if I be offered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, if my blood be poured out as a libation upon the &s;acrifice of your faith.</NOTE> upon the &s;acrifice and &s;er|vice
of your faith, I joy and rejoice with
you all." This con&s;i&s;tency is material, if the
con&s;ideration of it be confined to the epi&s;tle.
It is farther material, as it agrees, with re|&s;pect
to the duration of St. Paul's fir&s;t im|pri&s;onment
at Rome, with the account deli|vered
in the Acts, which, having brought
the apo&s;tle to Rome, clo&s;es the hi&s;tory by
telling us "that he dwelt there <HI>two whole
years</HI> in his own hired hou&s;e."</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Chap. i. ver. 23. "For I am in a &s;trait
betwixt two, having a de&s;ire to depart,
and to be with Chri&s;t; which is far better."</P>
<P>With this compare 2 Cor. chap. v. ver. 8.
"We are confident and willing rather to be
ab&s;ent from the body, and to be pre&s;ent
with the Lord."</P>
<P>The &s;amene&s;s of &s;entiment in the&s;e two
quotations is obvious. I rely however not
&s;o much upon that, as upon the &s;imilitude
<PB N="273" REF="275">
in the train of thought which in each
epi&s;tle leads up to this &s;entiment, and upon
the &s;uitablene&s;s of that train of thought to
the circum&s;tances under which the epi&s;tles
purport to have been written. This, I
conceive, be&s;peaks the production of the
&s;ame mind, and of a mind operating upon
real circum&s;tances. The &s;entiment is in
both places preceded by the contemplation
of imminent per&s;onal danger. To the
Philippians he writes, in the twentieth
ver&s;e of this chapter, "According to my
earne&s;t expectation and my hope, that in
nothing I &s;hall be a&s;hamed, but that with
all boldne&s;s, as always, <HI>&s;o now al&s;o,</HI> Chri&s;t
&s;hall be magnified in my body, whether
it be by life or by death." To the Co|rinthians,
"Troubled on every &s;ide, yet not
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; perplexed, but not in de&s;pair;
per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken; ca&s;t down,
but not de&s;troyed; always bearing about
in the body the dying of the Lord Je&s;us."
This train of reflection is continued to the
place from whence the words which we
compare are taken. The two epi&s;tles,
though written at different times, from dif|ferent
<PB N="274" REF="276">
places, and to different churches,
were both written under circum&s;tances
which would naturally recal to the au|thor's
mind the precarious condition of his
life, and the perils which con&s;tantly await|ed
him. When the epi&s;tle to the Philip|pians
was written, the author was a pri|&s;oner
at home, expecting his trial. When
the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the Corinthians was
written, he had lately e&s;caped a danger in
which he had given him&s;elf over for lo&s;t.
The epi&s;tle opens with a recollection of this
&s;ubject, and the impre&s;&s;ion accompanied
the writer's thoughts throughout.</P>
<P>I know that nothing is ea&s;ier than to
tran&s;plant into a forged epi&s;tle a &s;entiment
or expre&s;&s;ion which is found in a true one;
or, &s;uppo&s;ing both epi&s;tles to be forged by
the &s;ame hand, to in&s;ert the &s;ame &s;entiment
or expre&s;&s;ion in both. But the difficulty is
to introduce it in ju&s;t and clo&s;e connection
with the train of thought going before, and
with a train of thought apparently gene|rated
by the circum&s;tances under which the
epi&s;tle is written. In two epi&s;tles, purport|ing
to be written on different occa&s;ions,
<PB N="275" REF="277">
and in different periods of the author's hi&s;|tory,
this propriety would not ea&s;ily be ma|naged.</P>

<P>Chap. i. 29, 30; ii. 1, 2. "For unto

only to believe on him, but al&s;o to &s;uffer
for his &s;ake, having the &s;ame conflict which
<HI>ye &s;aw in me,</HI> and now hear to be in me.
If there be, therefore, any con&s;olation

fellow&s;hip of the Spirit, if any bowels
and mercies: fulfil ye my joy; that ye be
like minded, having the &s;ame love, being
of one accord, of one mind."</P>
<P>With this compare Acts xvi. 22: "And
the multitude (at Philippi) ro&s;e up again&s;t
them (Paul and Silas); and the magi&s;trates
rent off their clothes, and commanded to
beat them; and when they had laid many
&s;tripes upon them, they ca&s;t them into
pri&s;on, charging the jailer to keep them
&s;afely; who having received &s;uch a
<PB N="276" REF="278">
charge, thru&s;t them into the inner
pri&s;on, and made their feet fa&s;t in the
&s;tocks."</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age in the epi&s;tle is very remark|able.
I know not an example in any writ|ing
of a ju&s;ter pathos, or which more truly
repre&s;ents the workings of a warm and affec|tionate
mind, than what is exhibited in the
quotation before us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original is very &s;pirited. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. The apo&s;tle reminds
his Philippians of their being joined with
him&s;elf in the endurance of per&s;ecution for
the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. He conjures them, by
the ties of their common profe&s;&s;ion and
their common &s;ufferings, to "fulfil his joy;"
to complete, by the unity of their faith, and
by their mutual love, that joy with which
the in&s;tances he had received of their zeal
and attachment had in&s;pired his brea&s;t.
Now if this was the real effu&s;ion of St.
Paul's mind, of which it bears the &s;tronge&s;t
internal character, then we have in the
<PB N="277" REF="279">
words "the &s;ame conflict which ye &s;aw in
me," an authentic confirmation of &s;o
much of the apo&s;tle's hi&s;tory in the Acts,

and through that of the intelligence and ge|neral
fidelity of the hi&s;torian.</P>

<P>THERE is a circum&s;tance of conformity
between St. Paul's hi&s;tory and his
letters, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which were written
during his fir&s;t impri&s;onment at Rome,
and more e&s;pecially the epi&s;tles to the Co|lo&s;&s;ians
and Ephe&s;ians, which, being too
clo&s;e to be accounted for from accident,
yet too indirect and latent to be imputed to
de&s;ign, cannot ea&s;ily be re&s;olved into any
other original than truth. Which circum|&s;tance
is this, that St. Paul in the&s;e epi&s;tles
attributes his impri&s;onment not to his
preaching of Chri&s;tianity, but to his a&s;|&s;erting
the right of the Gentiles to be ad|mitted
into it without conforming them|&s;elves
to the Jewi&s;h law. This was the
doctrine to which he con&s;idered him&s;elf as
a martyr. Thus in the epi&s;tle before us,
<PB N="279" REF="281">
chap. i. ver. 24. (I Paul) "who now rejoice
in my &s;ufferings for you"&mdash;"<HI>for you,</HI>" i.e.
for tho&s;e whom he had never &s;een; for a
few ver&s;es afterwards he adds, "I would
that ye knew what great conflict I have
for you, and for them in Laodicea, and
for as many as have not &s;een my face
in the fle&s;h." His &s;ufferings therefore
for <HI>them</HI> was, in their general capacity of
Gentile Chri&s;tians, agreeably to what he
explicitly declares in his epi&s;tle to the
Ephe&s;ians, iv. 1. "For this cau&s;e, I Paul,
the pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>for you Gen|tiles.</HI>"
Again in the epi&s;tle now under
con&s;ideration, iv. 3. "Withal praying
al&s;o for us, that God would open unto us
a door of utterance to &s;peak the <HI>my&s;tery</HI>
of Chri&s;t, for which I am al&s;o in bonds."
What that "my&s;tery of Chri&s;t" was, the
epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians di&s;tinctly informs
us; "whereby when ye read ye may
under&s;tand my knowledge in the <HI>my&s;tery
of Chri&s;t,</HI> which, in other ages, was not
made known unto the &s;ons of men, as it
is now revealed unto his holy apo&s;tles
and prophets by the Spirit, <HI>that the Gen|tiles</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="282"><HI>&s;hould be fellow-heirs, and of the &s;ame
body, and partakers of his promi&s;e in Chri&s;t
by the go&s;pel.</HI>" This, therefore, was the
<HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> for which he declares him&s;elf to
be in bonds. Now let us enquire how the
occa&s;ion of St. Paul's impri&s;onment is re|pre&s;ented
in the hi&s;tory. The apo&s;tle had
not long returned to Jeru&s;alem from his &s;e|cond
vi&s;it into Greece, when an uproar
was excited in that city by the clamour of
certain A&s;iatic Jews, who, "having &s;een
Paul in the temple, &s;tirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him." The
charge advanced again&s;t him was, that "he
taught all men every where again&s;t the
people, and the law, and this place;
and farther brought Greeks al&s;o into
the temple, and polluted that holy
place." The former part of the charge
&s;eems to point at the doctrine, which he
maintained, of the admi&s;&s;ion of the Gen|tiles,
under the new di&s;pen&s;ation, to an in|di&s;criminate
participation of God's favour
with the Jews. But what follows makes the
matter clear. When, by the interference
of the chief captain, Paul had been re&s;cued
<PB N="281" REF="283">
out of the hands of the populace, and was
permitted to addre&s;s the multitude who had
followed him to the &s;tairs of the ca&s;tle, he
delivered a brief account of his birth, of
the early cour&s;e of his life, of his miracu|lous
conver&s;ion; and is proceeding in his
narrative, until he comes to de&s;cribe a vi|&s;ion
which was pre&s;ented to him, as he
was praying in the temple; and which bid
him depart out of Jeru&s;alem, "for I will
&s;end thee far hence <HI>unto the Gentiles.</HI>" Acts
xxii. 21. "They gave him audience,"
&s;ays the hi&s;torian, "<HI>unto this word</HI>; and
then lift up their voices, and &s;aid, Away
with &s;uch a fellow from the earth." No|thing
can &s;hew more &s;trongly than this ac|count
does, what was the offence which
drew down upon St. Paul the vengeance of
his countrymen. His mi&s;&s;ion to the Gen|tiles,
and his open avowal of that mi&s;&s;ion,
was the intolerable part of the apo&s;tle's
crime. But although the real motive of the
pro&s;ecution appears to have been the Apo|&s;tle's
conduct towards the Gentiles; yet,
when his accu&s;ers came before a Roman
magi&s;trate, a charge was to be framed of a
<PB N="282" REF="284">
more legal form. The profanation of the
temple was the article they cho&s;e to rely
upon. This, therefore, became the imme|diate
&s;ubject of Tertullus's oration before
Felix, and of Paul's defence. But that he
all along con&s;idered his mini&s;try among&s;t
the Gentiles as the actual &s;ource of the en|mity
that had been exerci&s;ed again&s;t him,
and in particular as the cau&s;e of the in&s;ur|rection
in which his per&s;on had been &s;eized,
is apparent from the conclu&s;ion of his di&s;|cour&s;e
before Agrippa: "I have appeared
unto thee," &s;ays he, de&s;cribing what pa&s;&s;|ed
upon his journey to Dama&s;cus, "for this
purpo&s;e, to make thee a mini&s;ter and a wit|ne&s;s,
both of the&s;e things which thou ha&s;t
&s;een, and of tho&s;e things in the which I
will appear unto thee, delivering thee
from the people and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I &s;end thee, to open
their eyes and to turn them from dark|ne&s;s
to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and inheritance among
them which are &s;anctified by faith that is
in me. Whereupon, O King Agrippa,
<PB N="283" REF="285">
I was not di&s;obedient unto the heavenly
vi&s;ion; but &s;hewed fir&s;t unto them of
Dama&s;cus, and of Jeru&s;alem, and through|out
all the coa&s;ts of Judea, and then to
the Gentiles, that they &s;hould repent and
turn to God, and do works meet for
repentance. <HI>For the&s;e cau&s;es</HI> the Jews
caught me in the temple, and went about
to kill me." The &s;eizing, therefore, of
St. Paul's per&s;on, from which he was
never di&s;charged till his final liberation at
Rome; and of which, therefore, his impri|&s;onment
at Rome was the continuation and
effect, was not in con&s;equence of any ge|neral
per&s;ecution &s;et on foot again&s;t Chri&s;|tianity;
nor did it befal him &s;imply, as
profe&s;&s;ing or teaching Chri&s;t's religion,
which James and the elders at Jeru&s;alem
did as well as he (and yet for any thing
that appears remained at that time unmo|le&s;ted);
but it was di&s;tinctly and &s;pecifically
brought upon him by his activity in preach|ing
to the Gentiles, and by his boldly
placing them upon a level with the once|favoured
and &s;till &s;elf-&s;lattered po&s;terity of
Abraham. How well St. Paul's letters,
<PB N="284" REF="286">
purporting to be written during this im|pri&s;onment,
agree with this account of
its cau&s;e and origin, we have already
&s;een.</P>

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 10. "Ari&s;tarchus my fel|low-pri&s;oner
&s;aluteth you, and Marcus &s;i&s;|ter's
&s;on to Barnabas, touching whom ye
received commandments; if he come
unto you, receive him, and Je&s;us, which
is called Ju&s;tus, who are of the circum|ci&s;ion."</P>
<P>We find Ari&s;tarchus as a companion of
our apo&s;tle in the nineteenth chapter of the
Acts, and the twenty-ninth ver&s;e: "And
the whole city of Ephe&s;us was filled with
confu&s;ion; and having caught Gaius and
<HI>Ari&s;tarchus,</HI> men of Macedonia, <HI>Paul's
companions in travel,</HI> they ru&s;hed with one
accord into the theatre." And we find him
upon his journey with St. Paul to Rome, in
the twenty-&s;eventh chapter, and the &s;econd
ver&s;e: "And when it was determined that
we &s;hould &s;ail into Italy, they delivered
<PB N="285" REF="287">
Paul and certain other pri&s;oners unto one
named Julius, a centurion of Augu&s;tus's
band; and, entering into a &s;hip of Adra|myttium,
we launched, meaning to &s;ail
by the coa&s;t of A&s;ia; one <HI>Ari&s;tarchus, a
Macedonian of The&s;&s;alonica, being with us.</HI>"
But might not the author of the epi&s;tle have
con&s;ulted the hi&s;tory; and, ob&s;erving that
the hi&s;torian had brought Ari&s;tarchus
along with Paul to Rome, might he not for
that rea&s;on, and without any other &s;oun|dation,
have put down his name among&s;t
the &s;alutations of an epi&s;tle, purporting to
be written by the apo&s;tle from that place?
I allow &s;o much of po&s;&s;ibility to this objec|tion,
that I &s;hould not have propo&s;ed this
in the number of coincidences clearly unde|&s;igned,
had Ari&s;tarchus &s;tood alone. The
ob&s;ervation that &s;trikes me in reading the
pa&s;&s;age is, that together with Ari&s;tarchus,
who&s;e journey to Rome we trace in the
hi&s;tory, are joined Marcus and Ju&s;tus, of
who&s;e coming to Rome the hi&s;tory &s;ays
nothing. Ari&s;tarchus alone appears in the
hi&s;tory, and Ari&s;tarchus alone would have
appeared in the epi&s;tle, if the author had
<PB N="286" REF="288">
regulated him&s;elf by that conformity. Or
if you take it the other way; if you &s;uppo&s;e
the hi&s;tory to have been made out of the
epi&s;tle, why the journey of Ari&s;tarchus to
Rome &s;hould be recorded, and not that of
Marcus and Ju&s;tus, if the groundwork of
the narrative was the appearance of Ari|&s;tarchus's
name in the epi&s;tle, &s;eems to be
unaccountable.</P>
<P>"Marcus, <HI>&s;i&s;ter's &s;on</HI> to Barnabas." Does
not this hint account for Barnabas's adhe|rence
to Mark in the conte&s;t that aro&s;e with
our apo&s;tle concerning him? "And &s;ome
days after Paul &s;aid unto Barnabas, Let us
go again and vi&s;it our brethren in every
city where we have preached the word
of the Lord, and &s;ee how they do: and
<HI>Barnabas determined to take with them
John, who&s;e &s;urname was Mark</HI>; but
Paul thought not good to take him with
them, who departed from Pamphylia, and
went not with them to the work; and the
contention was &s;o &s;harp between them, that
they departed a&s;under one from the other;
and &s;o Barnabas took Mark and &s;ailed
unto Cyprus." The hi&s;tory which records
<PB N="287" REF="289">
the di&s;pute has not pre&s;erved the circum|&s;tance
of Mark's relation&s;hip to Barnabas.
It is not where noticed but in the text before
us. As far, therefore, as it applies, the ap|plication
is certainly unde&s;igned.</P>
<P>"<HI>Si&s;ter's</HI> &s;on to Barnabas." This woman,
the mother of Mark, and the &s;i&s;ter of Bar|nabas,
was, as might be expected, a per&s;on
of &s;ome eminence among&s;t the Chri&s;tians of
Jeru&s;alem. It &s;o happens that we hear
of her in the hi&s;tory. "When Peter was
delivered from pri&s;on, he came to the
hou&s;e of <HI>Mary the mother of John, who&s;e
&s;urname was Mark,</HI> where many were
gathered together praying." Acts xii. 12.
There is &s;omewhat of coincidence in this;
&s;omewhat be&s;peaking real tran&s;actions
among&s;t real per&s;ons.</P>

<P>The following coincidence, though it
bear the appearance of great nicety and re|&s;inement,
ought not, perhaps, to be deem|ed
imaginary. In the &s;alutations with which
this, like mo&s;t of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, con|cludes,
we have "Ari&s;tarchus and Marcus,
<PB N="288" REF="290">
and Je&s;us, which is called Ju&s;tus, <HI>who
are of the circumci&s;ion</HI>" (iv. 10, 11). Then
follow al&s;o "Epaphras, Luke the beloved
phy&s;ician, and Demas." Now as this de|&s;cription,
"who are of the circumci&s;ion," is
added after the three fir&s;t names, it is inferred,
not without great appearance of probability,
that the re&s;t, among&s;t whom is Luke, were
not of the circumci&s;ion. Now can we di&s;|cover
any expre&s;&s;ion in the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles, which a&s;certains whether the
author of the book was a Jew or not? If
we can di&s;cover that he was not a Jew, we
fix a circum&s;tance in his character, which
coincides with what is here, indirectly in|deed,
but not very uncertainly, intimated
concerning Luke: and we &s;o far confirm
both the te&s;timony of the primitive church,
that the Acts of the Apo&s;tles was written
by St. Luke, and the general reality of the
per&s;ons and circum&s;tances brought toge|ther
in this epi&s;tle. The text in the Acts,
which has been con&s;trued to &s;hew that the
writer was not a Jew, is the nineteenth
ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, where, in de&s;crib|ing
the field which had been purcha&s;ed with
<PB N="289" REF="291">
the reward of Judas's iniquity, it is &s;aid,
"that it was known unto all the dwellers
at Jeru&s;alem; in&s;omuch as that field is
called, in <HI>their</HI> proper tongue, Aceldama,
that is to &s;ay, the field of blood." The&s;e
words are by mo&s;t commentators taken to be
the words and ob&s;ervation of the hi&s;torian,
and not a part of St. Peter's &s;peech, in the
mid&s;t of which they are found. If this be
admitted, then it is argued that the expre&s;|&s;ion,
"in <HI>their</HI> proper tongue," would not
have been u&s;ed by a Jew, but is &s;uitable to
the pen of a Gentile writing concerning
Jews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ben&s;on's Di&s;&s;ertation, vol. i. p. 318 of his works, Ed. 1756.</NOTE>. The reader will judge of the pro|bability
of this conclu&s;ion, and we urge
the coincidence no farther than that proba|bility
extends. The coincidence, if it be
one, is &s;o remote from all po&s;&s;ibility of de|&s;ign,
that nothing need be added to &s;atisfy

<P>Chap. iv. ver. 9. "With One&s;imus, a
faithful and beloved brother, <HI>who is one of
you.</HI>"</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve how it may be made out that
One&s;imus was a Colo&s;&s;ian. Turn to the
epi&s;tle to Philemon, and you will find that
One&s;imus was the &s;ervant or &s;lave of Phile|mon.
The que&s;tion therefore will be to
what city Philemon belonged. In the
epi&s;tle addre&s;&s;ed to him this is not de|clared.
It appears only that he was of the
&s;ame place, whatever that place was, with
an eminent chri&s;tian named Archippus.
"Paul, a pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Ti|mothy
our brother, unto Philemon our
dearly beloved and fellow-labourer; and to
our beloved Apphia, and <HI>Archippus</HI> our
fellow-&s;oldier, and to the church in thy
hou&s;e." Now turn back to the epi&s;tle to
the Colo&s;&s;ians, and you will find Archippus
&s;aluted by name among&s;t the Chri&s;tians of
that church. "Say to Archippus, take
<PB N="291" REF="293">
heed to the mini&s;try which thou ha&s;t
received in the Lord that thou ful&s;il it"
(iv. 17). The nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult is, that
One&s;imus al&s;o was of the &s;ame city, agree|ably
to what is &s;aid of him, "he is one of
you." And this re&s;ult is the effect, ei|ther
of truth which produces con&s;i&s;tency
without the writer's thought or care, or of
a contexture of forgeries confirming and
falling in with one another by a &s;pecies of
fortuity of which I know no example.
The &s;uppo&s;ition of de&s;ign, I think, is ex|cluded,
not only becau&s;e the purpo&s;e to
which the de&s;ign mu&s;t have been directed,
viz. the verification of the pa&s;&s;age in our
epi&s;tle, in which it is &s;aid concerning One|&s;imus,
"he is one of you," is a purpo&s;e
which would be lo&s;t upon ninety-nine
readers out of a hundred; but becau&s;e the
means made u&s;e of are too circuitous to
have been the &s;ubject of affectation and
contrivance. Would a forger, who had
this purpo&s;e in view, have left his readers
to hunt it out, by going forward and back|ward
from one epi&s;tle to another, in order
<PB N="292" REF="294">
to connect One&s;imus with Philemon, Phi|lemon

<HEAD>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE

<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is known to every reader of &s;cripture,
that the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians
&s;peaks of the coming of Chri&s;t in terms
which indicate an expectation of his &s;peedy
appearance: "For this we &s;ay unto you by
the word of the Lord, that <HI>we</HI> which are
alive and remain unto the coming of the
Lord &s;hall not prevent them which are
a&s;leep. For the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de&s;cend
from heaven with a &s;hout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of
God, and the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e
fir&s;t; then <HI>we which are alive and re|main,</HI>
&s;hall be caught up together with them
in the clouds&mdash;But ye, brethren, are not
in darkne&s;s, that that day &s;hould overtake
you as a thief" (chap. iv. 15, 16, 17.
chap. v. ver. 4).</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="296">
Whatever other con&s;truction the&s;e texts
may <HI>bear,</HI> the idea they leave upon the
mind of an ordinary reader, is that of the
author of the epi&s;tle looking for the day of
judgment to take place in his own time, or
near to it. Now the u&s;e which I make of this
circum&s;tance, is to deduce from it a proof
that the epi&s;tle it&s;elf was not the production
of a &s;ub&s;equent age. Would an impo&s;tor
have given this expectation to St. Paul, af|ter
experience had proved it to be erroneous?
or would he have put into the apo&s;tle's
mouth, or, which is the &s;ame thing, into writ|ings
purporting to come from his hand, ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
if not nece&s;&s;arily conveying, at
lea&s;t ea&s;ily interpreted to convey, an opinion
which was then known to be founded in
mi&s;take? I &s;tate this as an argument to
&s;hew that the epi&s;tle was cotemporary with
St. Paul, which is little le&s;s than to &s;hew
that it actually proceeded from his pen.
For I que&s;tion whether any ancient forge|ries
were executed in the life-time of the
per&s;on who&s;e name they bear; nor was the
primitive &s;ituation of the church likely to
give birth to &s;uch an attempt.</P>

<P>Our epi&s;tle concludes with a direction,
that it &s;hould be publickly read in the church
to which it was addre&s;&s;ed: "I charge
you by the Lord, that this epi&s;tle be read
unto all the holy brethren." The ex|i&s;tence
of this clau&s;e in the body of the
epi&s;tle is an evidence of its authenticity;
becau&s;e to produce a letter purporting to
have been publickly read in the church of
The&s;&s;alonica, when no &s;uch letter in truth
had been read or heard of in that church,
would be to produce an impo&s;ture de&s;truc|tive
of it&s;elf. At lea&s;t, it &s;eems unlikely
that the author of an impo&s;ture would vo|luntarily,
and even officiou&s;ly, afford a handle
to &s;o plain an objection. Either the epi&s;tle
was publickly read in the church of The&s;|&s;alonica
during St. Paul's life-time, or it was
not. If it was, no publication could be
more authentic, no &s;pecies of notoriety more
unque&s;tionable, no method of pre&s;erving the
integrity of the copy more &s;ecure. If it
was not, the clau&s;e we produce would re|main
<PB N="296" REF="298">
a &s;tanding condemnation of the for|gery,
and, one would &s;uppo&s;e, an invinci|ble
impediment to its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>If we connect this article with the pre|ceding,
we &s;hall perceive that they com|bine
into one &s;trong proof of the genuine|ne&s;s
of the epi&s;tle. The preceding article
carries up the date of the epi&s;tle to the time
of St. Paul; the pre&s;ent article &s;ixes the pub|lication
of it to the church of The&s;&s;alonica.
Either therefore the church of The&s;&s;alo|nica
was impo&s;ed upon by a fal&s;e epi&s;tle,
which in St. Paul's life-time they received
and read publickly as his, carrying on a
communication with him all the while, and
the epi&s;tle referring to the continuance of
that communication; or other Chri&s;tian
churches, in the &s;ame life-time of the apo|&s;tle,
received an epi&s;tle purporting to have
been publickly read in the church of The&s;|&s;alonica,
which neverthele&s;s had not been

remains, that the epi&s;tle now in our

<P>Between our epi&s;tle and the hi&s;tory the
accordancy in many points is circum&s;tan|tial
and complete. The hi&s;tory relates,
that, after Paul and Silas had been beaten
with many &s;tripes at Philippi, &s;hut up in the
inner pri&s;on, and their feet made fa&s;t in
the &s;tocks, as &s;oon as they were di&s;charged
from their con&s;inement they departed from
thence, and, when they had pa&s;&s;ed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, came to The&s;|&s;alonica,
where Paul opened and alledged
that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, Acts xvi. 23, &amp;c.
The epi&s;tle written in the name of Paul and
Sylvanus (Silas), and of Timotheus, who
al&s;o appears to have been along with them
at Philippi, (vide Phil. No. iv.) &s;peaks to the
church of The&s;&s;alonica thus: "Even after
that we had &s;uffered before, and were
&s;hamefully entreated, as ye know, at
Philippi, we were bold in our God to
&s;peak unto you the go&s;pel of God with
much contention" (ii. 21).</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory relates, that after they had
been &s;ome time at The&s;&s;alonica, "the
<PB N="298" REF="300">
Jews who believed not &s;et all the city
in an uproar, and a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of
Ja&s;on where Paul and Silas were, and
&s;ought to bring them out to the people."
Acts xvii. 5. The epi&s;tle declares, "when
we were with you, we told you before
that we &s;hould &s;uffer tribulation; even
<HI>as it came to pa&s;s, and ye know</HI>" (iii. 4).</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory brings Paul and Silas and
Timothy together at Corinth, &s;oon after the
preaching of the go&s;pel at The&s;&s;alonica:
"And when Silas and Timotheus were come
from Macedonia (to Corinth), Paul was
pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit." Acts xviii. 5. The
epi&s;tle is written in the name of the&s;e
three per&s;ons, who con&s;equently mu&s;t have
been together at the time, and &s;peaks
throughout of their mini&s;try at The&s;&s;a|lonica
as a recent tran&s;action: "We, bre|thren,
<HI>being taken from you for a &s;hort
time,</HI> in pre&s;ence not in heart, endeavour|ed
the more abundantly to &s;ee your face
with great de&s;ire" (ii. 17).</P>
<P>The harmony is indubitable; but the
points of hi&s;tory in which it con&s;i&s;ts, are
&s;o expre&s;sly &s;et &s;orth in the narrative, and
<PB N="299" REF="301">
&s;o directly referred to in the epi&s;tle, that it
becomes nece&s;&s;ary for us to &s;hew, that the
facts in one writing were not copied from
the other. Now amid&s;t &s;ome minuter di&s;|crepancies,
which will be noticed below,
there is one circum&s;tance which mixes it|&s;elf
with all the allu&s;ions in the epi&s;tle, but
does not appear in the hi&s;tory any where;
and that is of a vi&s;it which St. Paul had in|tended
to pay to the The&s;&s;alonians during
the time of his re&s;iding at Corinth: "Where|fore
we would have come unto you
(even I Paul) once and again, but Satan
hindered us" (ii. 18). "Night and
day praying exceedingly that we might
&s;ee your face, and might perfect that
which is lacking in your faith. Now
God him&s;elf and our Father, and our
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, direct our way unto
you" (iii. 10, 11). Concerning a de|&s;ign
which was not executed, although the
per&s;on him&s;elf, who was con&s;cious of his
own purpo&s;e, &s;hould make mention in his
letters, nothing is more probable than that
his hi&s;torian &s;hould be &s;ilent, if not igno|rant.
The author of the epi&s;tle could not
<PB N="300" REF="302">
however have learnt this circum&s;tance from
the hi&s;tory, for it is not there to be met
with; nor, if the hi&s;torian had drawn his
materials from the epi&s;tle, is it likely that he
would have pa&s;&s;ed over a circum&s;tance,
which is among&s;t the mo&s;t obvious and pro|minent
of the facts to be collected from that
&s;ource of information.</P>

and had proceeded from thence to Corinth,
whil&s;t he was exerci&s;ing his mini&s;try in that
city, Silas and Timothy came to him from
Macedonia, Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5. But to
reconcile the hi&s;tory with the clau&s;e in the
epi&s;tle which makes St. Paul &s;ay, "I thought
it good to be left at Athens alone, and to
&s;end Timothy unto you," it is nece&s;&s;ary
to &s;uppo&s;e that Timothy had come up with
St. Paul at Athens; a circum&s;tance which
the hi&s;tory does not mention. I remark
therefore, that, although the hi&s;tory do not
expre&s;sly notice this arrival, yet it contains
intimations which render it extremely pro|bable
that the fact took place. Fir&s;t, as
&s;oon as Paul had reached Athens, he &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age back to Silas and Timothy "for
to come to him with all &s;peed." Acts,
chap. xvii. ver. 15. Secondly, his &s;tay at
Athens was on purpo&s;e that they might join
him there: "Now whil&s;t Paul <HI>waited for</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="304"><HI>them at Athens,</HI> his &s;pirit was &s;tirred in
him" Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 16. Thirdly,
his departure from Athens does not appear
to have been in any &s;ort ha&s;tened or abrupt.
It is &s;aid, "after the&s;e things," viz. his di&s;|putation
with the Jews, his conferences
with the philo&s;ophers, his di&s;cour&s;e at Are|opagus,
and the gaining of &s;ome converts,
"he departed from Athens and came to
Corinth." It is not hinted that he quitted
Athens before the time that he had intended
to leave it; it is not &s;ugge&s;ted that he
was driven from thence, as he was from
many cities, by tumults or per&s;ecutions,
or becau&s;e his life was no longer &s;afe.
Ob&s;erve then the particulars which the hi&s;|tory
<HI>does</HI> notice&mdash;that Paul had ordered Ti|mothy
to follow him without delay, that
he waited at Athens on purpo&s;e that Ti|mothy
might come up with him, that he
&s;taid there as long as his own choice led
him to continue. Laying the&s;e circum|&s;tances
which the hi&s;tory does di&s;clo&s;e to|gether,
it is highly probable that Timothy
came to the apo&s;tle at Athens, a fact which
the epi&s;tle, we have &s;een, virtually a&s;&s;erts,
<PB N="303" REF="305">
when it makes Paul &s;end Timothy back
from Athens to The&s;&s;alonica. The <HI>&s;ending
back of Timothy into Macedonia</HI> accounts
al&s;o for his not coming to Corinth till after
Paul had been fixed in that city for &s;ome
con&s;iderable time. Paul had found out
Aquila and Pri&s;cilla, abode with them and
wrought, being of the &s;ame craft; and rea|&s;oned
in the &s;ynagogue every &s;abbath-day,
and per&s;uaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 1-5. All this pa&s;&s;ed
at Corinth before Silas and Timotheus were
come from Macedonia. Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5.
If this was the fir&s;t time of their coming up
with him after their &s;eparation at Beraea,
there is nothing to account for a delay &s;o
contrary to what appears from the hi&s;tory
it&s;elf to have been St. Paul's plan and ex|pectation.
This is a conformity of a pe|culiar
&s;pecies. The epi&s;tle di&s;clo&s;es a fact
which is not pre&s;erved in the hi&s;tory; but
which makes what is &s;aid in the hi&s;tory
more &s;ignificant, probable, and con&s;i&s;tent.
The hi&s;tory bears marks of an omi&s;&s;ion;
the epi&s;tle by reference furni&s;hes a circum|&s;tance
which &s;upplies that omi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Chap. ii. ver. 14. "For ye, brethren, be|came
followers of the churches of God
which in Judea are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; for ye
al&s;o have &s;uffered like things <HI>of your own
countrymen,</HI> even as they have of the
Jews."</P>
<P>To a reader of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles,
it might &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the per&s;e|cutions
which the preachers and converts
of Chri&s;tianity underwent, were &s;uffered at
the hands of their old adver&s;aries the Jews.
But, if we attend carefully to the accounts
there delivered, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that,
though the oppo&s;ition made to the go&s;pel
u&s;ually <HI>originated</HI> from the enmity of the
Jews, yet in almo&s;t all places the Jews
went about to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e, by
&s;tirring up the Gentile inhabitants again&s;t
their converted countrymen. Out of Ju|dea
they had not power to do much mi&s;|chief
in any other way. This was the ca&s;e
at The&s;&s;alonica in particular: "The Jews
which believed not, moved with envy, &s;et
all the city in an uproar." Acts, ch. xvii.
<PB N="305" REF="307">
ver. 5. It was the &s;ame a &s;hort time after|wards
at Beraea: "When the Jews of
The&s;&s;alonica had knowledge that the
word of God was preached of Paul at Be|raea,
they came thither al&s;o, and &s;tirred
up the people." Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 13.
And before this our apo&s;tle had met with a
like &s;pecies of per&s;ecution, in his progre&s;s
through the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia: "In every city the
unbelieving Jews &s;tirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected again&s;t
the brethren." Acts, ch. xiv. ver. 2. The
epi&s;tle therefore repre&s;ents the ca&s;e accu|rately
as the hi&s;tory &s;tates it. It was the
Jews always who &s;et on foot the per&s;ecu|tions
again&s;t the apo&s;tles and their follow|ers.
He &s;peaks truly therefore of them,
when he &s;ays in this epi&s;tle, "they both
killed the Lord Je&s;us and their own pro|phets,
and have <HI>per&s;ecuted us</HI>&mdash;forbidding
us to &s;peak unto the Gentiles" (ii. 15,
16). But out of Judea it was at the hands
of the Gentiles, it was "of their own coun|trymen,"
that the injuries they under|went
were immediately &s;u&s;tained: "Ye have
<PB N="306" REF="308">
&s;uffered like things of your own country|men,
even as they have of the Jews."</P>

<P>The apparent di&s;crepancies between our
epi&s;tle and the hi&s;tory, though of magnitude
&s;ufficient to repel the imputation of con|federacy
or tran&s;cription (in which view
they form a part of our argument), are nei|ther
numerous, nor very difficult to recon|cile.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e may be ob&s;erved in the
ninth and tenth ver&s;es of the &s;econd chapter:
"For ye remember, brethren, our labour
and travel; for labouring night and day,
becau&s;e we would not be chargeable unto
any of you, we preached unto you the
go&s;pel of God. Ye are witne&s;&s;es and
God al&s;o, how holily and ju&s;tly and un|blameably
we behaved our&s;elves among
you that believe." A per&s;on who reads
this pa&s;&s;age is naturally led by it to &s;up|po&s;e,
that the writer had dwelt at The&s;&s;a|lonica
for &s;ome con&s;iderable time; yet of
St. Paul's mini&s;try in that city, the hi&s;tory
<PB N="307" REF="309">
gives no other account than the following:
"that he came to The&s;&s;alonica, where was
a &s;ynagogue of the Jews; that, as his
manner was, he went in unto them, and
<HI>three &s;abbath-days</HI> rea&s;oned with them out
of the &s;criptures; that &s;ome of them be|lieved
and con&s;orted with Paul and Silas."
The hi&s;tory then proceeds to tell us, that
the Jews which believed not &s;et the city in
an uproar, and a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of Ja&s;on,
where Paul and his companions lodged;
that the con&s;equence of this outrage was,
that "the brethren immediately &s;ent away
Paul and Silas by night unto Beraea."
Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 1-10. From the men|tion
of his preaching three &s;abbath-days in
the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, and from the want
of any farther &s;pecification of his mini&s;try,
it has u&s;ually been taken for granted that
Paul did not continue at The&s;&s;alonica more
than three weeks. This, however, is in|ferred
without nece&s;&s;ity. It appears to have
been St. Paul's practice, in almo&s;t every
place that he came to, upon his fir&s;t arrival
to repair to the &s;ynagogue. He thought
<PB N="308" REF="310">
him&s;elf bound to propo&s;e the go&s;pel to the
Jews <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> agreeably to what he declared
at Antioch in Pi&s;idia; "it was nece&s;&s;ary
that the word of God &s;hould fir&s;t have
been &s;poken to you." Acts, ch. xiii.
ver. 46. If the Jews rejected his mini&s;try,
he quitted the &s;ynagogue, and betook him|&s;elf
to a Gentile audience. At Corinth, upon
his fir&s;t coming thither, he rea&s;oned in the
&s;ynagogue every &s;abbath; "but when the
Jews oppo&s;ed them&s;elves, and bla&s;phemed,
he departed thence," expre&s;sly telling
them, "from henceforth I will go unto the
Gentiles; and he remained in that city a
year and &s;ix months." Acts, ch. xviii.
ver. 6-11. At Ephe&s;us, in like manner,
for the &s;pace of three months he went into
the &s;ynagogue; but, "when divers were
hardened and believed not, but &s;pake evil
of that way, he departed from them and
&s;eparated the di&s;ciples, di&s;puting daily in
the &s;chool of one Tyrannus; and this
continued by the &s;pace of two years."
Acts, ch. xix. ver. 9, 10. Upon in&s;pecting
the hi&s;tory, I &s;ee nothing in it which nega|tives
<PB N="309" REF="311">
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that St. Paul pur&s;ued
the &s;ame plan at The&s;&s;alonica which he
adopted in other places; and that, though
he re&s;orted to the &s;ynagogue only three &s;ab|bath-days,
yet he remained in the city, and
in the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try among&s;t the
Gentile citizens, much longer; and until the
&s;ucce&s;s of his preaching had provoked the
Jews to excite the tumult and in&s;urrection
by which he was driven away.</P>
<P>Another &s;eeming di&s;crepancy is found in
the ninth ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter of the
epi&s;tle: "For they them&s;elves &s;how of us
what manner of entering in we had unto
you, and how <HI>ye turned to God from idols</HI>
to &s;erve the living and true God." This
text contains an a&s;&s;ertion, that, by means of
St. Paul's mini&s;try at The&s;&s;alonica, many
idolatrous Gentiles had been brought over to
Chri&s;tianity. Yet the hi&s;tory, in de&s;cribing
the effects of that mini&s;try, only &s;ays, that
"&s;ome of the Jews believed, and of the de|vout
Greeks a great multitude, and of the
chief women not a few" (ch. xvii. ver. 4).
The devout Greeks were tho&s;e who already
<PB N="310" REF="312">
wor&s;hipped the one true God; and there|fore
could not be &s;aid, by embracing Chri&s;ti|anity,
"to be turned to God from idols."</P>
<P>This is the difficulty. The an&s;wer may
be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the following ob&s;ervations.
The Alexandrian and Cambridge manu|&s;cripts
read (for <GAP DESC="foreign">). In which reading they are al&s;o
confirmed by the Vulgate Latin. And this
reading is in my opinion &s;trongly &s;upported
by the con&s;iderations, fir&s;t, that <GAP DESC="foreign">
alone, <HI>i. e.</HI> without <GAP DESC="foreign">, is u&s;ed in this
&s;en&s;e in this &s;ame chapter, Paul being come
to Athens, <GAP DESC="foreign">: &s;econdly, that
<GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> no where come together.
The expre&s;&s;ion is redundant. The <GAP DESC="foreign">
mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="foreign">. Thirdly, that the <GAP DESC="foreign">
is much more likely to have been left out
incuri&acirc; manus than to have been put in.
Or, after all, if we be not allowed to change
the pre&s;ent reading, which is undoubtedly
retained by a great plurality of copies, may
not the pa&s;&s;age in the hi&s;tory be con&s;idered
<PB N="311" REF="313">
as de&s;cribing only the effects of St. Paul's
di&s;cour&s;es during the three &s;abbath-days in
which he preached in the &s;ynagogue? and
may it not be true, as we have remarked
above, that his application to the Gentiles at
large, and his &s;ucce&s;s among&s;t them, was
po&s;terior to this?</P>

<P>IT may &s;eem odd to alledge ob&s;curity it|&s;elf
as an argument, or to draw a proof
in favour of a writing, from that which is
u&s;ually con&s;idered as the principal defect in
its compo&s;ition. The pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, how|ever,
furni&s;hes a pa&s;&s;age, hitherto unex|plained,
and probably inexplicable by us,
the exi&s;tence of which, under the darkne&s;s
and difficulties that attend it, can only be
accounted for upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the
epi&s;tle being genuine; and upon that &s;up|po&s;ition
is accounted for with great ea&s;e.
The pa&s;&s;age which I allude to is found in
the &s;econd chapter: "that day &s;hall not
come, except there come a falling away
fir&s;t, and that man of &s;in be revealed, the
&s;on of perdition, who oppo&s;eth and ex|alteth
him&s;elf above all that is called God,
<PB N="313" REF="315">
or that is wor&s;hipped; &s;o that he as God
&s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing
him&s;elf that he is God. Remember ye not,
that WHEN I WAS YET WITH YOU I TOLD
YOU THESE THINGS? <HI>And now ye know
what withholdeth, that he might be revealed
in his time</HI>; for the my&s;tery of iniquity doth
already work, <HI>only he that now letteth will
let, until he be taken out of the way</HI>; and
then &s;hall that wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume with the &s;pirit of
his mouth, and &s;hall de&s;troy with the
brightne&s;s of his coming." It were &s;u|perfluous
to prove, becau&s;e it is in vain to
deny, that this pa&s;&s;age is involved in great
ob&s;curity, more e&s;pecially the clau&s;es di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by Italics. Now the ob&s;ervation I
have to offer is founded upon this, that the
pa&s;&s;age expre&s;sly refers to a conver&s;ation
which the author had previou&s;ly holden
with the The&s;&s;alonians upon the &s;ame &s;ub|ject:
"Remember ye not, that when I was
yet with you <HI>I told you the&s;e things? And
now ye know</HI> what withholdeth." If &s;uch
conver&s;ation actually pa&s;&s;ed; if, whil&s;t he
was yet with them, "he <HI>told</HI> them tho&s;e
<PB N="314" REF="316">
things," then it follows that the epi&s;tle is
authentic. And of the reality of this con|ver&s;ation
it appears to be a proof, that what
is &s;aid in the epi&s;tle might be under&s;tood by
tho&s;e who had been pre&s;ent to &s;uch conver|&s;ation,
and yet be incapable of being ex|plained
by any other. No man writes un|intelligibly
on purpo&s;e. But it may ea&s;ily
happen, that a part of a letter which relates
to a &s;ubject, upon which the parties had
conver&s;ed together before, which refers to
what had been before <HI>&s;aid,</HI> which is in
truth a portion or continuation of a for|mer
di&s;cour&s;e, may be utterly without
meaning to a &s;tranger, who &s;hould pick up
the letter upon the road, and yet be per|fectly
clear to the per&s;on to whom it is di|rected,
and with whom the previous com|munication
had pa&s;&s;ed. And if, in a letter
which thus accidentally fell into my hands,
I found a pa&s;&s;age expre&s;sly referring to a
former conver&s;ation, and difficult to be ex|plained
without knowing that conver&s;ation,
I &s;hould con&s;ider this very difficulty as a
proof that the conver&s;ation had actually
pa&s;&s;ed, and con&s;equently that the letter con|tained
<PB N="315" REF="317">
the real corre&s;pondence of real per|&s;ons.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 8. "Neither did we eat any
man's bread for nought, but wrought with
labour night and day, that we might not
be-chargeable to any of you: not becau&s;e
we have not power, but to make our&s;elves
an en&s;ample unto you to follow."</P>
<P>In a letter, purporting to have been writ|ten
to another of the Macedonic churches,
we find the following declaration:</P>
<P>"Now ye, Philippians, know al&s;o that in
the beginning of the go&s;pel, when I de|parted
from Macedonia, <HI>no church commu|nicated
with me as concerning giving and
receiving, but ye only.</HI>"</P>
<P>The conformity between the&s;e two pa&s;|&s;ages
is &s;trong and plain. They confine the
tran&s;action to the &s;ame period. The epi&s;tle
to the Philippians refers to what pa&s;&s;ed "in
the beginning of the go&s;pel," that is to &s;ay,
during the fir&s;t preaching of the go&s;pel on
that &s;ide of the Aegean &s;ea. The epi&s;tle to
the The&s;&s;alonians &s;peaks of the apo&s;tle's con|duct
<PB N="316" REF="318">
in that city upon "his fir&s;t entrance in
unto them," which the hi&s;tory informs us
was in the cour&s;e of his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the pen|in&s;ula
of Greece.</P>
<P>As St. Paul tells the Philippians, "that
no church communicated with him, as
concerning giving and receiving, but they
only," he could not, con&s;i&s;tently with the
truth of this declaration, have received any
thing from the neighbouring church of
The&s;&s;alonica. What thus appears by ge|neral
implication in an epi&s;tle to another
church, when he writes to the The&s;&s;alonians
them&s;elves, is noticed expre&s;sly and parti|cularly:
"neither did we eat any man's
bread for nought, but wrought night and
day, that we might not be chargeable to
any of you."</P>
<P>The texts here cited farther al&s;o exhibit
a mark of conformity with what St. Paul is
made to &s;ay of him&s;elf in the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles. The apo&s;tle not only reminds
the The&s;&s;alonians that he had not been
chargeable to any of them, but he &s;tates
likewi&s;e the motive which dictated this re|&s;erve;
"not becau&s;e we have not power, but
<PB N="317" REF="319">
to make our&s;elves an en&s;ample unto you
to follow us" (chap. iii. ver. 9). This con|duct,
and what is much more preci&s;e, the
end which he had in view by it, was the
very &s;ame as that which the hi&s;tory attri|butes
to St. Paul in a di&s;cour&s;e, whichit re|pre&s;ents
him to have addre&s;&s;ed to the elders
of the church of Ephe&s;us: "Yea, ye your|&s;elves
al&s;o know that the&s;e hands have
mini&s;tered unto my nece&s;&s;ities, and to them
that were with me. I have <HI>&s;howed</HI> you
all things, how <HI>that &s;o labouring ye ought
to &s;upport the weak.</HI>" Acts, ch. xx. ver. 34.
The &s;entiment in the epi&s;tle and in the
&s;peech is in both parts of it &s;o much alike,
and yet the words which convey it &s;how &s;o
little of imitation or even of re&s;emblance,
that the agreement cannot well be explained
without &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;peech and the letter
to have really procceded from the &s;ame
per&s;on.</P>

<P>Our reader remembers the pa&s;&s;age in the
fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, in which
St. Paul &s;poke of the coming of Chri&s;t:
<PB N="318" REF="320">
"This we &s;ay unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive, and remain
unto the coming of the Lord, &s;hall not
prevent them which are a&s;leep; for the
Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven,
and the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t; then
we which are alive and remain, &s;hall be
caught up together with them in the
clouds, and &s;o &s;hall we be ever with the
Lord.&mdash;But ye, brethren, are not in dark|ne&s;s,
that that day &s;hould overtake you as a
thief." 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 15-17. and ch. v. ver.
4. It &s;hould &s;eem that the The&s;&s;alonians, or
&s;ome however among&s;t them, had from this
pa&s;&s;age conceived an opinion (and that not
very unnaturally) that the coming of Chri&s;t
was to take place in&s;tantly, <GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, nempe hoc anno, &s;ays Grotius, <GAP DESC="foreign"> hic dicitur de re prae&s;enti, ut Rom. viii. 38. 1 Cor. iii. 22. Gal. i. 4. Heb. ix. 9.</NOTE>;
and that this per&s;ua&s;ion had produced, as it
well might, much agitation in the church.
The apo&s;tle therefore now writes, among&s;t
other purpo&s;es, to quiet this alarm, and to
rectify the mi&s;con&s;truction that had been
<PB N="319" REF="321">
put upon his words: "Now we be&s;eech you,
brethren, by the coming of our Lord Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, and by our gathering together unto
him, that ye be not &s;oon &s;haken in mind,
or be troubled, neither by &s;pirit nor by
word, <HI>nor by letter, as from us,</HI> as that the
day of Chri&s;t is at hand." If the allu&s;ion
which we contend for be admitted, namely,
if it be admitted, that the pa&s;&s;age in the
&s;econd epi&s;tle relates to the pa&s;&s;age in the
fir&s;t, it amounts to a con&s;iderable proof of
the genuinene&s;s of both epi&s;tles. I have no
conception, becau&s;e I know no example, of
&s;uch a device in a forgery, as fir&s;t to frame
an ambiguous pa&s;&s;age in a letter, then to
repre&s;ent the per&s;ons to whom the letter is
addre&s;&s;ed as mi&s;taking the meaning of the
pa&s;&s;age, and la&s;tly to write a &s;econd letter
in order to correct this mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that this argument ari&s;es out
of the text, <HI>if</HI> the allu&s;ion be admitted; for I
am not ignorant that many expo&s;itors un|der&s;tand
the pa&s;&s;age in the &s;econd epi&s;tle, as
referring to &s;ome forged letters, which had
been produced in St. Paul's name, and in
which the apo&s;tle had been made to &s;ay that
<PB N="320" REF="322">
the coming of Chri&s;t was then at hand. In
defence, however, of the explanation which
we propo&s;e the reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;trong fact, that there exi&s;ts a
pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, to which that in
the &s;econd is capable of being referred, <HI>i. e.</HI>
which accounts for the error the writer is
&s;olicitous to remove. Had no other epi&s;tle
than the &s;econd been extant, and had it un|der

this: "We be&s;eech you, brethren, by the

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the third ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chap|ter,
"as I be&s;ought thee to abide &s;till
at Ephe&s;us when I went into Macedonia,"
it is evident that this epi&s;tle was written
&s;oon after St. Paul had gone to Macedonia
from Ephe&s;us. Dr. Ben&s;on fixes its date
to the time of St. Paul's journey, recorded
in the beginning of the twentieth chapter of
the Acts: "And after the uproar (excited by
Demetrius at Ephe&s;us) was cea&s;ed, Paul
called unto him the di&s;ciples, and em|braced
them, and departed for to go into
Macedonia." And in this opinion Dr.
Ben&s;on is followed by Michaelis, as he was
<PB N="324" REF="326">
preceded by the greater part of the com|mentators
who have con&s;idered the que&s;|tion.
There is however one objection to
the hypothe&s;is which the&s;e learned men ap|pear
to me to have overlooked; and it is
no other than this, that the &s;uper&s;cription
of the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the Corinthians
&s;eems to prove, that at the time St. Paul is
&s;uppo&s;ed by them to have written this epi&s;|tle
to Timothy, Timothy in truth was with
St. Paul in Macedonia. Paul, as it is re|lated
in the Acts, left Ephe&s;us "for to go
into Macedonia." When he had got into
Macedonia he wrote his &s;econd epi&s;tle to
the Corinthians. Concerning this point
there exi&s;ts little variety of opinion. It is
plainly indicated by the contents of the
epi&s;tle. It is al&s;o &s;trongly implied that the
epi&s;tle was written <HI>&s;oon</HI> after the apo&s;tle's
arrival in Macedonia; for he begins his let|ter
by a train of reflection, referring to his
per&s;ecutions in A&s;ia as to recent tran&s;ac|tions,
as to dangers from which he had
lately been delivered. But in the &s;alutation
with which the epi&s;tle opens <HI>Timothy is joined
with St. Paul,</HI> and con&s;equently could not
<PB N="325" REF="327">
at that time be "left behind at Ephe&s;us."
And as to the only &s;olution of the difficulty
which can be thought of, viz. that Timo|thy,
though he was left behind at Ephe&s;us
upon St. Paul's departure from A&s;ia, yet
might follow him &s;o &s;oon after, as to come
up with the apo&s;tle in Macedonia, before he
wrote his epi&s;tle to the Corinthians; that
&s;uppo&s;ition is incon&s;i&s;tent with the terms
and tenor of the epi&s;tle throughout. For
the writer &s;peaks uniformly of his intention
to return to Timothy at Ephe&s;us, and not of
his expecting Timothy to come to him in
Macedonia: "The&s;e things write I unto
thee, <HI>hoping to come unto thee &s;hortly</HI>; but if
I tarry long that thou maye&s;t know how
thou oughte&s;t to behave thy&s;elf" (chap. iii.
ver. 14, 15). "<HI>Till I come</HI> give attendance
to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine"
(chap. iv. ver. 13).</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the leaving of Timothy
behind at Ephe&s;us, when Paul went into
Macedonia, &s;uits not with any journey into
Macedonia recorded in the Acts, I concur
with Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on in placing the date of
this epi&s;tle, and the journey referred to in
<PB N="326" REF="328">
it, at a period &s;ub&s;equent to St. Paul's fir&s;t
impri&s;onment at Rome, and con&s;equently
&s;ub&s;equent to the aera, up to which the Acts
of the Apo&s;tles brings his hi&s;tory. The only
difficulty which attends our opinion is, that
St. Paul mu&s;t, according to us, have come
to Ephe&s;us after his liberation at Rome,
contrary as it &s;hould &s;eem to what he fore|told
to the Ephe&s;ian elders, "that they
&s;hould &s;ee his face no more." And it is
to &s;ave the infallibility of this prediction,
and for no other rea&s;on of weight, that an
earlier date is a&s;&s;igned to this epi&s;tle. The
prediction it&s;elf however, when con&s;idered
in connection with the circum&s;tances under
which it was delivered, does not &s;eem to
demand &s;o much anxiety. The words in
que&s;tion are found in the twenty-fifth ver&s;e
of the twentieth chapter of the Acts: "And
now behold, I know that ye all, among
whom I have gone preaching the king|dom
of God, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more."
In the twenty-&s;econd and twenty-third
ver&s;es of the &s;ame chapter, i. e. two ver&s;es
before, the apo&s;tle makes this declaration:
"And now behold, I go bound in the &s;pirit
<PB N="327" REF="329">
unto Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things
that &s;hall befal me there; &s;ave that the
Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every city, &s;ay|ing,
that bonds and afflictions abide me."
This "witne&s;&s;ing of the Holy Gho&s;t" was
undoubtedly prophetic and &s;upernatural.
But it went no farther than to foretel that
bonds and afflictions awaited him. And I
can very well conceive, that this might be
all which was communicated to the apo&s;tle
by extraordinary revelation, and that the
re&s;t was the conclu&s;ion of his own mind,
the de&s;ponding inference which he drew
from &s;trong and repeated intimations of
approaching danger. And the expre&s;&s;ion
"I know," which St. Paul here u&s;es, does
not perhaps, when applied to future events
affecting him&s;elf, convey an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o po|&s;itive
and ab&s;olute as we may at fir&s;t &s;ight
apprehend. In the fir&s;t chapter of the epi&s;|tle
to the Philippians and the twenty-fifth
ver&s;e, "I know," &s;ays he, "that I &s;hall
abide and continue with you all for your
joy and furtherance of faith." Notwith|&s;tanding
this &s;trong declaration, in the &s;e|cond
chapter and twenty-third ver&s;e of this
<PB N="328" REF="330">
&s;ame epi&s;tle, and &s;peaking al&s;o of the very
&s;ame event, he is content to u&s;e a language
of &s;ome doubt and uncertainty: "Him there|fore
I hope to &s;end pre&s;ently, &s;o &s;oon <HI>as I
&s;hall &s;ee how it will go with me</HI>; but <HI>I tru&s;t</HI>
in the Lord that I al&s;o my&s;elf &s;hall come
&s;hortly." And a few ver&s;es preceding
the&s;e, he not only &s;eems to doubt of his
&s;afety, but almo&s;t to de&s;pair; to contem|plate
the po&s;&s;ibility at lea&s;t of his condem|nation
and martyrdom: "Yea, and if I be
offered upon the &s;acrifice and &s;ervice of
your faith, I joy and rejoice with you
all."</P>

<P>But can we &s;how that St. Paul vi&s;ited
Ephe&s;us after his liberation at Rome? or
rather, can we collect any hints from his
other letters which make it probable that
he did? If we can, then we have a <HI>coinci|dence.</HI>
If we cannot, we have only an unau|thorized
&s;uppo&s;ition, to which the exigency
of the ca&s;e compels us to re&s;ort. Now, for
this purpo&s;e, let us examine the epi&s;tle to
the Philippians and the epi&s;tle to Philemon.
<PB N="329" REF="331">
The&s;e two epi&s;tles purport to be written
whil&s;t St. Paul was yet a pri&s;oner at Rome.
To the Philippians he writes as follows:
"I tru&s;t in the Lord that I al&s;o my&s;elf
&s;hall come &s;hortly." To Philemon, who
was a Colo&s;&s;ian, he gives this direction:
"But withal, prepare me al&s;o a lodging,
for I tru&s;t that through your prayers I
&s;hall be given unto you." An in&s;pection
of the map will &s;how us that Colo&s;&s;e was a
city of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, lying ea&s;tward, and
at no great di&s;tance from Ephe&s;us. Philippi
was on the other, i. e. the we&s;tern &s;ide of
the Aegean &s;ea. If the apo&s;tle executed his
purpo&s;e; if, in pur&s;uance of the intention
expre&s;&s;ed in his letter to Philemon, he came
to Colo&s;&s;e &s;oon after he was &s;et at liberty at
Rome, it is very improbable that he would
omit to vi&s;it Ephe&s;us, which lay &s;o near to
it, and where he had &s;pent three years of
his mini&s;try. As he was al&s;o under a pro|mi&s;e
to the church of Philippi to &s;ee them
"&s;hortly;" if he pa&s;&s;ed from Colo&s;&s;e to
Philippi, or from Philippi to Colo&s;&s;e, he
could hardly avoid taking Ephe&s;us in his
way.</P>

<P>Chap. v. ver. 9. "Let not a widow be
taken into the number under three&s;core
years old."</P>
<P>This accords with the account delivered
in the &s;ixth chapter of the Acts: "And in
tho&s;e days, when the number of the di&s;|ciples
was multiplied, there aro&s;e a mur|muring
of the Grecians again&s;t the He|brews,
<HI>becau&s;e their widows were neglected
in the daily mini&s;tration.</HI>" It appears that,
from the fir&s;t formation of the Chri&s;tian
church, provi&s;ion was made out of the pub|lic
funds of the &s;ociety for the indigent <HI>wi|dows</HI>
who belonged to it. The hi&s;tory, we
have &s;een, di&s;tinctly records the exi&s;tence of
&s;uch an in&s;titution at Jeru&s;alem, a few
years after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion; and is led
to the mention of it very incidentally, viz.
by a di&s;pute, of which it was the occa&s;ion,
and which produced important con&s;e|quences
to the Chri&s;tian community. The
epi&s;tle, without being &s;u&s;pected of borrow|ing
from the hi&s;tory, refers, briefly indeed,
<PB N="331" REF="333">
but deci&s;ively, to a &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hment,
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;ome years afterwards at Ephe&s;us.
This agreement indicates that both writings
were founded upon real circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But, in this article, the material thing
to be noticed is the mode of expre&s;&s;ion:
"Let not a widow be taken into the num|ber."
No previous account or explana|tion
is given, to which the&s;e words, "into
the number," can refer; but the direction
comes conci&s;ely and unpreparedly: "Let
not a widow be taken into the number."
Now this is the way in which a man writes,
who is con&s;cious that he is writing to per|&s;ons
already acquainted with the &s;ubject of
his letter; and who, he knows, will readily
apprehend and apply what he &s;ays by vir|tue
of their being &s;o acquainted: but it is
not the way in which a man writes upon
any other occa&s;ion; and lea&s;t of all, in
which a man would draw up a feigned let|ter,
or introduce a &s;uppo&s;itious fact<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not altogether unconnected with our general purpo&s;e to remark, in the pa&s;&s;age before us, the &s;elec|tion and re&s;erve which St. Paul recommends to the go|vernors of the church of Ephe&s;us, in the be&s;towing re|lief upon the poor, becau&s;e it refutes a calumny which has been in&s;inuated, that the liberality of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians was an artifice to catch converts; or one of the temptations however, by which the idle and mendi|cant were drawn into this &s;ociety: "Let not a widow be taken into the number under three&s;core years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for her good works; if &s;he have brought up children, if &s;he have lodged &s;trangers, if &s;he have wa&s;hed the &s;aints feet, if &s;he have relieved the afflicted, if &s;he have diligently followed every good work: but the younger widows refu&s;e" (v. 9. 10, 11). And, in another place, "If any man or woman that believeth have wi|dows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged, that it may relieve them that are widows indeed." And to the &s;ame effect, or rather more to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, the apo&s;tle writes in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians: "Even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither let him eat," i. e. at the public expence; "for we hear that there are &s;ome which walk among you di&s;orderly <HI>working not at all,</HI> but are bu&s;y|bodies: now them that are &s;uch, we command and ex|hort, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with quietne&s;s they work, and eat their own bread." Could a de|&s;igning or di&s;&s;olute poor take advantage of bounty regu|lated with &s;o much caution? or could the mind which dictated the&s;e &s;ober and prudent directions be influ|enced in his recommendations of public charity by any other than the propere&s;t motives of beneficence?</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Imagine an impo&s;tor &s;itting down to
forge an epi&s;tle in the name of St. Paul. Is
it credible that it &s;hould come into his head
to give &s;uch a direction as this; &s;o remote
from every thing of doctrine or di&s;cipline,
every thing of public concern to the reli|gion
or the church, or to any &s;ect, order, or
party in it, and from every purpo&s;e with
which &s;uch an epi&s;tle could be written? It
&s;eems to me that nothing but reality, that
is, the real valetudinary &s;ituation of a real
<PB N="335" REF="337">
per&s;on, could have &s;ugge&s;ted a thought of
&s;o dome&s;tic a nature.</P>
<P>But if the peculiarity of the advice be
ob&s;ervable, the place in which it &s;tands is
more &s;o. The context is this: "Lay hands
&s;uddenly on no man, neither be partaker
of other men's &s;ins; keep thy&s;elf pure;
drink no longer water, but u&s;e a little
wine for thy &s;tomach's &s;ake, and thine

open before hand, going before to judg|ment;
and &s;ome men they follow after."
The direction to Timothy about his diet
&s;tands between two &s;entences, as wide from
the &s;ubject as po&s;&s;ible. The train of thought
&s;eems to be broken to let it in. Now
when does this happen? It happens when
a man writes as he remembers; when he
puts down an article that occurs the mo|ment
it occurs, le&s;t he &s;hould afterwards

<P>What was the mercy which St. Paul
here commemorates, and what was the
crime of which he accu&s;es him&s;elf, is ap|parent
from the ver&s;es immediately preced|ing:
"I thank Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord, who
hath enabled me, for that he counted me
faithful, putting me into the mini&s;try,

<HI>and injurious</HI>; but I obtained <HI>mercy,</HI>
becau&s;e I did it ignorantly in unbelief"
(ch. i. ver. 12, 13). The whole quotation
plainly refers to St. Paul's original enmity to
the Chri&s;tian name, the interpo&s;ition of provi|dence
in his conver&s;ion, and his &s;ub&s;equent
de&s;ignation to the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel;
and by this reference a&s;&s;irms indeed the
&s;ub&s;tance of the apo&s;tle's hi&s;tory delivered
in the Acts. But what in the pa&s;&s;age
&s;trikes my mind mo&s;t powerfully, is the
ob&s;ervation that is rai&s;ed out of the fact:
"For this cau&s;e I obtained mercy, that in
me fir&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t might &s;hew forth all
long-&s;uffering, for a pattern to them
which &s;hould hereafter believe on him

reflection, &s;pringing from the circum|&s;tances
of the author's conver&s;ion, or rather
from the impre&s;&s;ion which that great event
had left upon his memory. It will be &s;aid,
perhaps, that an impo&s;tor, acquainted with
St. Paul's hi&s;tory, may have put &s;uch a &s;en|timent
into his mouth; or, what is the &s;ame
thing, into a letter drawn up in his name.
But where, we may a&s;k, is &s;uch an impo&s;|tor
<PB N="338" REF="340">
to be found? The piety, the truth, the
benevolence of the thought ought to pro|tect
it from this imputation. For, though
we &s;hould allow that one of the great ma&s;|ters

<P>IT was the uniform tradition of the pri|mitive

the epi&s;tle before us, compared with what
fell from the apo&s;tle's pen in other letters
purporting to have been written from Rome.
That our pre&s;ent epi&s;tle was written whil&s;t
St. Paul was a <HI>pri&s;oner,</HI> is di&s;tinctly intimated
by the eighth ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter:
"Be not thou therefore a&s;hamed of the
te&s;timony of our Lord, nor of me his pri|&s;oner."
And whil&s;t he was a pri&s;oner <HI>at
Rome,</HI> by the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth
<PB N="340" REF="342">
ver&s;es of the &s;ame chapter: "The Lord give
mercy unto the hou&s;e of One&s;iphorus; for
he oft refre&s;hed me, and was not a&s;ham|ed
of my chain: but when he was in
Rome he &s;ought me out very diligently,
and found me." Since it appears from the
former quotation that St. Paul wrote this
epi&s;tle in confinement, it will hardly admit of
doubt that the word <HI>chain,</HI> in the latter
quotation, refers to that con&s;inement; the
chain by which he was <HI>then</HI> bound, the cu&s;|tody
in which he was then kept. And if
the word chain de&s;ignate the author's con|finement
at the time of writing the epi&s;tle,
the next words determine it to have been
written from Rome: "He was not a&s;hamed
of my chain; but when he was in Rome
he &s;ought me out very diligently." Now
that it <HI>was</HI> not written during the apo&s;tle's
fir&s;t impri&s;onment at Rome, or during the
&s;ame impri&s;onment in which the epi&s;tles to
the Ephe&s;ians, the Colo&s;&s;ians, the Philip|pians,
and Philemon, were written, may be
gathered, with con&s;iderable evidence, from
a compari&s;on of the&s;e &s;everal epi&s;tles with
the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="341" REF="343">
I. In the former epi&s;tles the author con&s;i|dently
looked forward to his liberation from
confinement, and his &s;peedy departure from
Rome. He tells the Philippians (ch. ii.
ver. 24), "I tru&s;t in the Lord that I al&s;o
my&s;elf &s;hall come &s;hortly." Philemon
he bids to prepare for him a lodging; "for
I tru&s;t," &s;ays he, "that through your
prayers, I &s;hall be given unto you"
(ver. 22). In the epi&s;tle before us he
holds a language extremely different: "I
am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my departure is at hand. I have
fought a good fight; I have fini&s;hed my
cour&s;e; I have kept the faith: hence|forth
there is laid up for me a crown of
righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righte|ous
judge, &s;hall give me at that day"
(ch. iv. ver. 6-8).</P>
<P N="2">II. When the former epi&s;tles were writ|ten
from Rome, Timothy was with St.
Paul; and is joined with him in writing to
the Colo&s;&s;ians, the Philippians, and to Phile|mon.
The pre&s;ent epi&s;tle implies that he
was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">III. In the former epi&s;tles Demas was
<PB N="342" REF="344">
with St. Paul at Rome: "Luke, the belov|ed
phy&s;ician, and Demas, greet you." In
the epi&s;tle now before us: "Demas hath
for&s;aken him, having loved this pre&s;ent
world, and is gone to The&s;&s;alonica."</P>
<P N="4">IV. In the former epi&s;tle, Mark was
with St. Paul, and joins in &s;aluting the Co|lo&s;&s;ians.
In the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle, Timothy is
ordered to "bring him with him, for he is
profitable to me for the mini&s;try" (ch. iv.
ver. 11).</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of Timothy and of Mark might
be very well accounted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing
the pre&s;ent epi&s;tle to have been written <HI>be|fore</HI>
the others; &s;o that Timothy, who is here
exhorted "to come &s;hortly unto him" (ch.
iv. ver. 9.) might have arrived, and that
Mark, "whom he was to bring with him"
(ch. iv. ver. 11), might have al&s;o reached
Rome in &s;ufficient time to have been with
St. Paul when the four epi&s;tles were
written: but then &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition is in|con&s;i&s;tent
with what is &s;aid of Demas, by
which the po&s;teriority of this to the other
epi&s;tles is &s;trongly indicated; for in the
other epi&s;tles Demas was with St. Paul, in
<PB N="343" REF="345">
the pre&s;ent he hath "for&s;aken him, and is
gone to The&s;&s;alonica." The oppo&s;ition
al&s;o of &s;entiment, with re&s;pect to the event
of the per&s;ecution, is hardly reconcileable
to the &s;ame impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>The two following con&s;iderations, which
were fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted upon this que&s;tion by
Ludovicus Capellus, are &s;till more conclu|&s;ive.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the twentieth ver&s;e of the fourth
chapter, St. Paul informs Timothy "that
Era&s;tus abode at Corinth,"
<GAP DESC="foreign">. The form of expre&s;&s;ion implies,
that Era&s;tus had &s;taid behind at Corinth,
when St. Paul left it. But this could not
be meant of any journey from Corinth
which St. Paul took prior to his fir&s;t impri|&s;onment
at Rome; for when Paul departed
from Corinth, as related in the twentieth
chapter of the Acts, Timothy was with
him: and this was the la&s;t time the apo&s;tle
left Corinth before his coming to Rome;
becau&s;e he left it to proceed on his way to
Jeru&s;alem, &s;oon after his arrival at which
place he was taken into cu&s;tody, and con|tinued
in that cu&s;tody till he was carried to
<PB N="344" REF="346">
Cae&s;ar's tribunal. There could be no need
therefore to inform Timothy that "Era&s;tus
&s;taid behind at Corinth" upon this occa&s;ion,
becau&s;e, if the fact was &s;o, it mu&s;t have
been known to Timothy who was pre&s;ent,
as well as to St. Paul.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the &s;ame ver&s;e our epi&s;tle al&s;o &s;tates
the following article: "Trophimus have I
left at Miletum &s;ick." When St. Paul
pa&s;&s;ed through Miletum on his way to Je|ru&s;alem,
as related Acts xx. Trophimus was
not left behind, but accompanied him to
that city. He was indeed the occa&s;ion of
the uproar at Jeru&s;alem, in con&s;equence of
which St. Paul was apprehended; for "they
had &s;een," &s;ays the hi&s;torian, "before
with him in the city, Trophimus an
Ephe&s;ian, whom they &s;uppo&s;ed that Paul
had brought into the temple." This
was evidently the la&s;t time of Paul's being
at Miletus before his fir&s;t impri&s;onment;
for, as hath been &s;aid, after his apprehen|&s;ion
at Jeru&s;alem, he remained in cu&s;tody
till he was &s;ent to Rome.</P>
<P>In the&s;e two articles we have a journey
referred to, which mu&s;t have taken place
<PB N="345" REF="347">
&s;ub&s;equent to the conclu&s;ion of St. Luke's
hi&s;tory, and of cour&s;e after St. Paul's libe|ration
from his fir&s;t impri&s;onment. The
epi&s;tle therefore, which contains this refe|rence,
&s;ince it appears from other parts of
it to have been written whil&s;t St. Paul was
a pri&s;oner at Rome, proves that he had re|turned
to that city again, and undergone
there a &s;econd impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>I do not produce the&s;e particulars for the
&s;ake of the &s;upport which they lend to the
te&s;timony of the fathers concerning St.
Paul's <HI>&s;econd</HI> impri&s;onment, but to remark
their con&s;i&s;tency and agreement with one
another. They are all re&s;olvable into one
&s;uppo&s;ition: and although the &s;uppo&s;ition
it&s;elf be in &s;ome &s;ort only negative, viz. that
the epi&s;tle was not written during St.
Paul's fir&s;t re&s;idence at Rome, but in &s;ome
future impri&s;onment in that city; yet is the
con&s;i&s;tency not le&s;s worthy of ob&s;ervation;
for the epi&s;tle touches upon names and
circum&s;tances connected with the date and
with the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t impri&s;onment,
and mentioned in letters written during that
impri&s;onment, and &s;o touches upon them,
<PB N="346" REF="348">
as to leave what is &s;aid of one con&s;i&s;tent
with what is &s;aid of others, and con&s;i&s;tent
al&s;o with what is &s;aid of them in different
epi&s;tles. Had one of the&s;e circum&s;tances
been &s;o de&s;cribed, as to have fixed the date
of the epi&s;tle to the fir&s;t impri&s;onment, it
would have involved the re&s;t in contradic|tion.
And when the number and particu|larity
of the articles which have been
brought together under this head are con|&s;idered;
and when it is con&s;idered al&s;o, that
the compari&s;ons we have formed among&s;t
them, were in all probability neither pro|vided
for, nor thought of, by the writer of
the epi&s;tle, it will be deemed &s;omething
very like the effect of truth, that no invin|cible
repugnancy is perceived between
them.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>In the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, in the &s;ix|teenth
chapter, and at the fir&s;t ver&s;e, we
are told that Paul "came to Derbe and
Ly&s;tra, and behold a certain di&s;ciple was
there named Timotheus, the &s;on of a cer|tain
<PB N="347" REF="349">
woman, which was a Jewe&s;s, and be|lieved;
but his father was a Greek." In
the epi&s;tle before us, in the fir&s;t chapter
and at the fifth ver&s;e, St. Paul writes to Timo|thy
thus: "Greatly de&s;iring to &s;ee thee, be|ing
mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled
with joy, when I call to remembrance the
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt
fir&s;t in thy grandmother Lois, <HI>and thy mo|ther
Eunice</HI>; and I am per&s;uaded that in
thee al&s;o." Here we have a fair unforced
example of coincidence. In the hi&s;tory
Timothy was the "&s;on of a Jewe&s;s <HI>that</HI>
believed:" in the epi&s;tle St. Paul ap|plauds
"the <HI>faith</HI> which dwelt in his mother
Eunice." In the hi&s;tory it is &s;aid of the
mother, "that &s;he was a Jewe&s;s, and be|lieved;"
of the father, "that he was a
Greek." Now when it is &s;aid of the mo|ther
<HI>alone</HI> "that &s;hebelieved," the father
being neverthele&s;s mentioned in the &s;ame
&s;entence, we are led to &s;uppo&s;e of the father,
that he did not believe, i. e. either that he
was dead, or that he remained unconverted.
Agreeably hereunto, whil&s;t prai&s;e is be&s;tow|ed
in the epi&s;tle upon one parent, and upon
<PB N="348" REF="350">
her &s;incerity in the faith, no notice is taken
of the other. The mention of the grand|mother
is the addition of a circum&s;tance
not found in the hi&s;tory: but it is a cir|cum&s;tance
which, as well as the names of
the parties, might naturally be expected to
be known to the apo&s;tle, though overlook|ed
by his hi&s;torian.</P>

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 15. "And that from a
child thou ha&s;t known the holy &s;crip|tures,
which are able to make thee wi&s;e
unto &s;alvation."</P>
<P>This ver&s;e di&s;clo&s;es a circum&s;tance which
agrees exactly with what is intimated in the
quotation from the Acts, adduced in the la&s;t
number. In that quotation it is recorded
of Timothy's mother, "that &s;he was a Jew|e&s;s."
This de&s;cription is virtually, "though,
I am &s;atisfied," unde&s;ignedly, recognized in
the epi&s;tle, when Timothy is reminded in
it, "that from a child he had known the
holy &s;criptures." "The holy &s;criptures"
undoubtedly meant the &s;criptures of the
Old Te&s;tament. The expre&s;&s;ion bears that
<PB N="349" REF="351">
&s;en&s;e in every place in which it occurs.
Tho&s;e of the New had not yet acquired the
name, not to mention, that in Timothy's
childhood, probably none of them exi&s;ted.
In what manner then could Timothy have
known "from a child" the Jewi&s;h &s;crip|tures,
had he not been born, on one &s;ide or
on both, of Jewi&s;h parentage? Perhaps he
was not le&s;s likely to be carefully in&s;tructed
in them, for that his mother alone profe&s;&s;ed
that religion.</P>

<P>Chap. ii. ver. 22. "Flee al&s;o <HI>youthful</HI>
lu&s;ts, but follow righteou&s;ne&s;s, faith, cha|rity,
peace, with them that call on the
Lord out of a pure heart."</P>
<P>"<HI>Flee al&s;o youthful lu&s;ts.</HI>" The &s;uitable|ne&s;s
of this precept to the age of the per&s;on
to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, is gathered from
1 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 12: "Let no man de|&s;pi&s;e
thy youth." Nor do I deem the le&s;s
of this coincidence, becau&s;e the propriety
re&s;ides in a &s;ingle epithet; or becau&s;e this
one precept is joined with, and followed by,
a train of others, not more applicable to Ti|mothy,
<PB N="350" REF="352">
than to any ordinary convert. It
is in the&s;e tran&s;ient and cur&s;ory allu&s;ions
that the argument is be&s;t founded. When
a writer dwells and re&s;ts upon a point in
which &s;ome coincidence is di&s;cerned, it may
be doubted whether he him&s;elf had not fa|bricated
the conformity, and was endea|vouring
to di&s;play and &s;et it off. But when
the reference is contained in a &s;ingle word,
unob&s;erved perhaps by mo&s;t readers, the
writer pa&s;&s;ing on to other &s;ubjects, as un|con&s;cious
that he had hit upon a corre&s;pond|ency,
or un&s;olicitous whether it were re|marked

<P>Chap. iii. ver. 10, 11. "But thou ha&s;t
fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
purpo&s;e, faith, long-&s;uffering, charity, pa|tience,
per&s;ecutions, afflictions, which
came unto me <HI>at Antioch, at Iconium, at
Ly&s;tra</HI>; what per&s;ecutions I endured: but
out of them all the Lord delivered me."</P>
<P>The Antioch here mentioned was not
<PB N="351" REF="353">
Antioch the capital of Syria, where Paul and
Barnabas re&s;ided "a long time;" but An|tioch
in Pi&s;idia, to which place Paul and
Barnabas came in their fir&s;t apo&s;tolic pro|gre&s;s,
and where Paul delivered a memora|ble
di&s;cour&s;e, which is pre&s;erved in the thir|teenth
chapter of the Acts. At this Antioch
the hi&s;tory relates, that "the Jews &s;tirred
up the devout and honourable women,
and the chief men of the city, <HI>and rai&s;ed
per&s;ecution again&s;t Paul and Barnabas,</HI> and
expelled them out of their coa&s;ts. But
they &s;hook off the du&s;t of their feet again&s;t
them, and came unto <HI>Iconium.</HI> . . . . And
it came to pa&s;s in Iconium, that they went
both together into the &s;ynagogue of the
Jews, and &s;o &s;pake that a great multitude
both of the Jews and al&s;o of the Greeks
believed; but the unbelieving Jews &s;tirred
up the Gentiles, and made their minds
evil-affected again&s;t the brethren. Long
time therefore abode they &s;peaking boldly
in the Lord, which gave te&s;timony unto
the word of his grace, and granted &s;igns
and wonders to be done by their hands.
But the multitude of the city was divided;
<PB N="352" REF="354">
and part held with the Jews, and part with
the apo&s;tles. And when there was an
a&s;&s;ault made both of the Gentiles and al&s;o
of the Jews, with their rulers, <HI>to u&s;e them
de&s;pitefully and to &s;tone</HI> them, they were
ware of it, and fled unto <HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> and Derbe,
cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that
lieth round about, and there they preached
the go&s;pel . . . . And there came thither
certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who per&s;uaded the people, and having
&s;toned Paul, drew him out of the city,
&s;uppo&s;ing he had been dead. Howbeit,
as the di&s;ciples &s;tood round about him, he
ro&s;e up and came into the city; and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe: and when they had preached the
go&s;pel in that city, and had taught many,
they returned again to Ly&s;tra, and to Ico|nium,
and to Antioch." This account
compri&s;es the period to which the allu&s;ion
in the epi&s;tle is to be referred. We have &s;o
far therefore a conformity between the hi&s;|tory
and the epi&s;tle, that St. Paul is a&s;&s;erted
in the hi&s;tory to have &s;uffered per&s;ecutions in
the three cities, his per&s;ecutions at which
<PB N="353" REF="355">
are appealed to in the epi&s;tle; and not only
&s;o, but to have &s;uffered the&s;e per&s;ecutions
both in immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and in the
order in which the cities are mentioned in
the epi&s;tle. The conformity al&s;o extends
to another circum&s;tance. In the apo&s;tolic
hi&s;tory Ly&s;tra and Derbe are commonly
mentioned together: in the quotation from
the epi&s;tle Ly&s;tra is mentioned, and not
Derbe. And the di&s;tinction will appear on
this occa&s;ion to be accurate; for St. Paul is
here enumerating his per&s;ecutions: and al|though
he underwent grievous per&s;ecutions
in each of the three cities through which he
pa&s;&s;ed to Derbe, at Derbe it&s;elf he met with
none: "The next day he departed," &s;ays the
hi&s;torian, "To Derbe; and when they had
preached the go&s;pel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to Ly&s;|tra."
The epi&s;tle, therefore, in the names
of the cities, in the order in which they
are enumerated, and in the place at which
the enumeration &s;tops, corre&s;ponds exactly
with the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But a &s;econd que&s;tion remains, namely,
how the&s;e per&s;ecutions were "known" to
<PB N="354" REF="356">
Timothy, or why the apo&s;tle &s;hould recal
the&s;e in particular to his remembrance, ra|ther
than many other per&s;ecutions with
which his mini&s;try had been attended.
When &s;ome time, probably three years, af|terwards
(<HI>vide</HI> Pear&s;on's Annales Paulinas),
St. Paul made a &s;econd journey through the
&s;ame country, "in order to go again and vi|&s;it
the brethren in every city where he
had preached the word of the Lord," we
read, Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 1. that, "when
he came to Derbe and Ly&s;tra, behold a
certain di&s;ciple was there named Timo|theus."
One or other therefore of the&s;e
cities was the place of Timothy's abode. We
read moreover that he was well reported of
by the brethren that were at Ly&s;tra and
Iconium; &s;o that he mu&s;t have been well
acquainted with the&s;e places. Al&s;o again,
when Paul came to Derbe and Ly&s;tra, Ti|mothy
was already a di&s;ciple: "Behold a
certain di&s;ciple was there named Timo|theus."
He mu&s;t, therefore, have been
converted <HI>before.</HI> But &s;ince it is expre&s;sly
&s;tated in the epi&s;tle, that Timothy was con|verted
by St. Paul him&s;elf, that he was "his
<PB N="355" REF="357">
own &s;on in the faith;" it follows that he
mu&s;t have been converted by him upon his
former journey into tho&s;e parts; which was
the very time when the apo&s;tle underwent
the per&s;ecutions referred to in the epi&s;tle.
Upon the whole then, per&s;ecutions at the
&s;everal cities named in the epi&s;tle are ex|pre&s;sly
recorded in the Acts; and Timo|thy's
knowledge of this part of St. Paul's
hi&s;tory, which knowledge is appealed to in
the epi&s;tle, is fairly deduced from the place
of his abode, and the time of his conver|&s;ion.
It may farther be ob&s;erved, that it
is probable from this account, that St. Paul
was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e per&s;ecutions when
Timothy became known to him. No won|der
then that the apo&s;tle, though in a letter
written long afterwards, &s;hould remind his
favourite convert of tho&s;e &s;cenes of affliction
and di&s;tre&s;s under which they fir&s;t met.</P>
<P>Although this coincidence, as to the
names of the cities, be more &s;pecific and di|rect
than many which we have pointed out,
yet I apprehend there is no ju&s;t rea&s;on for
thinking it to be artificial; for had the
writer of the epi&s;tle &s;ought a coincidence
<PB N="356" REF="358">
with the hi&s;tory upon this head, and
&s;earched the Acts of the Apo&s;tles for the
purpo&s;e, I conceive he would have &s;ent us
at once to Philippi and The&s;&s;alonica, where
Paul &s;uffered per&s;ecution, and where, from
what is &s;tated, it may ea&s;ily be gathered that
Timothy accompanied him, rather than
have appealed to per&s;ecutions as known to
Timothy, in the account of which per&s;ecu|tions
Timothy's pre&s;ence is not mentioned;
it not being till after one entire chapter, and
in the hi&s;tory of a journey three years fu|ture
to this, that Timothy's name occurs in
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles for the fir&s;t time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO TITUS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY characteri&s;tic circum&s;tance in
this epi&s;tle, is the quotation from
Epimenides, chap. i. ver. 12: "One of
them&s;elves, even a prophet of their own,
&s;aid, the Cretians are always liars, evil
bea&s;ts, &s;low bellies."</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign"></Q>
<P>I call this quotation characteri&s;tic, be|cau&s;e
no writer in the New Te&s;tament, ex|cept
St. Paul, appealed to heathen te&s;ti|mony;
and becau&s;e St. Paul repeatedly did
&s;o. In his celebrated &s;peech at Athens,
pre&s;erved in the &s;eventeenth chapter of the
Acts, he tells his audience, that "in God
we live, and move, and have our being;
as certain al&s;o of your own poets have
&s;aid, for we are al&s;o his offspring."</P>
<Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign"></Q>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360">
The reader will perceive much &s;imilarity
of manner in the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages. The re|ference
in the &s;peech is to a heathen poet; it
is the &s;ame in the epi&s;tle. In the &s;peech the
apo&s;tle urges his hearers with the authority
of a poet <HI>of their own</HI>; in the epi&s;tle he avails
him&s;elf of the &s;ame advantage. Yet there is
a variation, which &s;hows that the hint of in|&s;erting
a quotation in the epi&s;tle was not, as
it may be &s;u&s;pected, borrowed from &s;eeing
the like practice attributed to St. Paul in
the hi&s;tory; and it is this, that in the epi&s;tle
the author cited is called a <HI>prophet,</HI> "one of
them&s;elves, even a <HI>prophet</HI> of their own."
Whatever might be the rea&s;on for calling
Epimenides a prophet; whether the names
of poet and prophet were occa&s;ionally con|vertible;
whether Epimenides in particular
had obtained that title, as Grotius &s;eems to
have proved; or whether the appellation
was given to him, in this in&s;tance, as hav|ing
delivered a de&s;cription of the Cretan
character, which the future &s;tate of morals
among&s;t them verified; whatever was the
rea&s;on (and any of the&s;e rea&s;ons will ac|count
for the variation, &s;uppo&s;ing St. Paul
<PB N="359" REF="361">
to have been the author), one point is plain,
namely, if the epi&s;tle had been forged, and
the author had in&s;erted a quotation in it
merely from having &s;een an example of the
&s;ame kind in a &s;peech a&s;cribed to St. Paul,
he would &s;o far have imitated his original,
as to have introduced his quotation in the
&s;ame manner, that is, he would have given
to Epimenides the title which he &s;aw there
given to Aratus. The other &s;ide of the al|ternative
is that the hi&s;tory took the hint
from the epi&s;tle. But that the author of
the Acts of the Apo&s;tles had not the epi&s;tle
to Titus before him, at lea&s;t that he did not
u&s;e it as one of the documents or materials
of his narrative, is rendered nearly certain
by the ob&s;ervation that the name of Titus
does not once occur in his book.</P>
<P>It is well known, and was remarked by St.

chapter of the Corinthians, "evil communi|cations
corrupt good manners," is an Iam|bic

<P>There exi&s;ts a vi&s;ible affinity between the
epi&s;tle to Titus and the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Ti|mothy.
Both letters were addre&s;&s;ed to per|&s;ons
left by the writer to pre&s;ide in their re|&s;pective
churches during his ab&s;ence. Both
letters are principally occupied in de&s;cribing
the qualifications to be &s;ought for, in tho&s;e
whom they &s;hould appoint to offices in the
church; and the ingredients of this de&s;crip|tion
are in both letters nearly the &s;ame.
Timothy and Titus are likewi&s;e cautioned
again&s;t the &s;ame prevailing corruptions, and,
in particular, again&s;t the &s;ame mi&s;direction
of their cares and &s;tudies. This affinity
obtains, not only in the &s;ubject of the let|ters,
which, from the &s;imilarity of &s;ituation
in the per&s;ons to whom they were ad|dre&s;&s;ed,
might be expected to be &s;omewhat
alike, but extends, in a great variety of in|&s;tances,
to the phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions. The
writer acco&s;ts his two friends with the &s;ame
<PB N="361" REF="365">
&s;alutation, and pa&s;&s;es on to the bu&s;ine&s;s of
his letter by the &s;ame tran&s;ition.</P>
<P>"Unto Timothy, <HI>my own &s;on in the faith,</HI>
grace, mercy, and peace from God our
Father, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: <HI>as I be|&s;ought
thee to abide &s;till at Ephe&s;us, when I
went into Macedonia,</HI>" &amp;c. 1 Tim. chap. i.
ver. 2, 3.</P>
<P>"To Titus, <HI>mine own &s;on after the common
faith,</HI> grace, mercy, and peace from God
the Father, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t our
Saviour: <HI>for this cau&s;e left I thee in Crete.</HI>"
Tit. chap. i. ver. 4, 5.</P>
<P>If Timothy was "not to <HI>give heed to
fables</HI> and endle&s;s <HI>genealogies,</HI> which mini|&s;ter
<HI>que&s;tions,</HI>" 1 Tim. chap. i. ver. 4; "Ti|tus
al&s;o was to avoid fooli&s;h <HI>que&s;tions,</HI> and
<HI>genealogies,</HI> and contentions" (chap. iii. ver.
9); "and was to rebuke them &s;harply, <HI>not
giving heed to Jewi&s;h fables</HI>" (chap. i. ver.
14). If Timothy was to be a pattern (<GAP DESC="foreign">),
1 Tim. chap. iv. ver. 12; &s;o was Titus
(chap. ii. ver. 7). If Timothy was to "let
no man de&s;pi&s;e his youth," 1 Tim. chap.
iv. ver. 12; Titus al&s;o was to "let no
man de&s;pi&s;e him" (chap. ii. ver. 15).
This verbal con&s;ent is al&s;o ob&s;ervable in
<PB N="362" REF="366">
&s;ome very peculiar expre&s;&s;ions, which have
no relation to the particular character of
Timothy or Titus.</P>
<P>The phra&s;e "it is a faithful &s;aying"
(<GAP DESC="foreign">), made u&s;e of to preface
&s;ome &s;entence upon which the writer lays
a more than ordinary &s;tre&s;s, occurs three
times in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, once
in the &s;econd, and once in the epi&s;tle be|fore
us, and in no other part of St. Paul's
writings; and it is remarkable that the&s;e
three epi&s;tles were probably all written to|wards
the conclu&s;ion of his life; and that
they are the only epi&s;tles which were writ|ten
after his fir&s;t impri&s;onment at Rome.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation belongs to another
&s;ingularity of expre&s;&s;ion, and that is in the
epithet "<HI>&s;ound</HI>" (<GAP DESC="foreign">), as applied to
words or doctrine. It is thus u&s;ed, twice
in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, twice in the
&s;econd, and three times in the epi&s;tle to
Titus, be&s;ide two cognate expre&s;&s;ions
<GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, and it is
found, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in no other part
of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The phra&s;e "God our Saviour" &s;tands
<PB N="363" REF="367">
in nearly the &s;ame predicament. It is re|peated
three times in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Ti|mothy,
as many in the epi&s;tle to Titus, and
in no other book of the New Te&s;tament oc|curs
at all, except once in the epi&s;tle of Jude.</P>
<P>Similar terms, intermixed indeed with
others, are employed, in the two epi&s;tles,
in enumerating the qualifications required
in tho&s;e, who &s;hould be advanced to &s;ta|tions
of authority in the church.</P>
<P>"A bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s, <HI>the hu&s;band

ver. 6-8.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t natural account which can be
given of the&s;e re&s;emblances, is to &s;uppo&s;e
that the two epi&s;tles were written nearly at
the &s;ame time, and whil&s;t the &s;ame ideas
and phra&s;es dwelt in the writer's mind. Let
us enquire therefore, whether the notes of
time, extant in the two epi&s;tles, in any man|ner
favour this &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that it was nece&s;&s;ary to
refer the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy to a date
&s;ub&s;equent to St. Paul's fir&s;t impri&s;onment
at Rome, becau&s;e there was no journey into
Macedonia prior to that event, which ac|corded
with the circum&s;tance of leaving
"Timothy behind at Ephe&s;us." The jour|ney
of St. Paul from Crete, alluded to in the
<PB N="365" REF="369">
epi&s;tle before us, and in which Titus "was
left in Crete to &s;et in order the things
that were wanting," mu&s;t, in like man|ner,
be carried to the period which inter|vened
between his fir&s;t and &s;econd impri&s;on|ment.
For the hi&s;tory, which reaches, we
know, to the time of St. Paul's fir&s;t impri|&s;onment,
contains no account of his going to
Crete, except upon his voyage as a pri&s;oner
to Rome; and that this could not be the
occa&s;ion referred to in our epi&s;tle is evident
from hence, that when St. Paul wrote this
epi&s;tle, he appears to have been at liberty;
whereas, after that voyage, he continued
for two years at lea&s;t in confinement. Again,
it is agreed that St. Paul wrote his fir&s;t epi|&s;tle
to Timothy from Macedonia: "As I
be&s;ought thee to abide &s;till at Ephe&s;us,
when I went (or came) into Macedonia."
And that he was in the&s;e parts, <HI>i. e.</HI> in this
penin&s;ula, when he wrote the epi&s;tle to Ti|tus,
is rendered probable by his directing
Titus to come to him to Nicopolis: "When
I &s;hall &s;end Artemas unto thee or Tychi|cus,
be diligent (make ha&s;te) to come unto
me to Nicopolis; for I have determined
<PB N="366" REF="370">
there to winter." The mo&s;t noted city of
that name was in Epirus, near to Actium.
And I think the form of &s;peaking, as well
as the nature of the ca&s;e, renders it probable,
that the writer was at Nicopolis, or in the
neighbourhood thereof, when he dictated
this direction to Titus.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if we may be allowed
to &s;uppo&s;e that St. Paul, after his liberation
at Rome, &s;ailed into A&s;ia, taking Crete in
his way; that from A&s;ia, and from Ephe&s;us,
the capital of that country, he proceeded into
Macedonia, and cro&s;&s;ing the penin&s;ula in his
progre&s;s, came into the neighbourhood of
Nicopolis; we have a route which falls in
with every thing. It executes the intention
expre&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle of vi&s;iting Colo&s;&s;e
and Philippi as &s;oon as he &s;hould be &s;et at
liberty at Rome. It allows him to leave
"Titus at Crete," and "Timothy at Ephe|&s;us,
as he went into Macedonia;" and to
write to both not long after from the penin|&s;ula
of Greece, and probably the neighbour|hood
of Nicopolis: thus bringing together
the dates of the&s;e two letters, and thereby
accounting for that affinity between them,
<PB N="367" REF="371">
both in &s;ubject and language, which our re|marks
have pointed out. I confe&s;s that the
journey, which we have thus traced out for
St. Paul, is, in a great mea&s;ure, hypothetic;
but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that it is a &s;pecies
of con&s;i&s;tency, which &s;eldom belongs to
fal&s;ehood, to admit of an hypothe&s;is, which
includes a great number of independent cir|cum&s;tances
without contradiction.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ingular corre&s;pondency between
this epi&s;tle and that to the Colo&s;&s;ians
has been remarked already. An a&s;&s;ertion in
the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, viz. that "One|&s;imus
was one of them," is verified by
the epi&s;tle to Philemon; and is verified, not
by any mention of Colo&s;&s;e, any the mo&s;t
di&s;tant intimation concerning the place of
Philemon's abode, but &s;ingly by &s;tating One|&s;imus
to be Philemon's &s;ervant, and by join|ing
in the &s;alutation Philemon with Archip|pus;
for this Archippus, when we go back
to the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, appears to
have been an inhabitant of that city, and,
as it &s;hould &s;eem, to have held an office of
authority in that church. The ca&s;e &s;tands
thus. Take the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians alone,
and no circum&s;tance is di&s;coverable which
makes out the a&s;&s;ertion, that One&s;imus was
<PB N="369" REF="373">
"one of them." Take the epi&s;tle to Phile|mon
alone, and nothing at all appears con|cerning
the place to which Philemon or his
&s;ervant One&s;imus belonged. For any thing
that is &s;aid in the epi&s;tle, Philemon might
have been a The&s;&s;alonian, a Philippian, or
an Ephe&s;ian, as well as a Colo&s;&s;ian. Put the
two epi&s;tles together and the matter is clear.
The reader perceives a <HI>junction</HI> of circum|&s;tances,
which a&s;certains the conclu&s;ion at
once. Now, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be add|ed
in this place is, that this corre&s;pondency
evinces the genuinene&s;s of one epi&s;tle, as
well as of the other. It is like comparing
the two parts of a cloven tally. Coin|cidence
proves the authenticity of both.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>And this coincidence is perfect; not only
in the main article of &s;howing, by implica|tion,
One&s;imus to be a Colo&s;&s;ian, but in
many dependent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. "I be&s;eech thee for my &s;on One&s;imus,
whom <HI>I have &s;ent</HI> again" (ver 10-12).
It appears from the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians,
<PB N="370" REF="374">
that, in truth, One&s;imus was &s;ent at that
time to Colo&s;&s;e: "All my &s;tate &s;hall Tychi|cus
declare, whom I have &s;ent unto you
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, <HI>with One&s;imus</HI> a faith|ful
and beloved brother." Colo&s;. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9.</P>
<P N="2">2. "I be&s;eech thee for my &s;on One&s;imus,
<HI>whom I have begotten in my bonds</HI>" (ver.
10). It appears from the preceding quota|tion,
that One&s;imus was with St. Paul when
he wrote the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians; and
that he wrote that epi&s;tle <HI>in impri&s;onment</HI> is
evident from his declaration in the fourth
chapter and third ver&s;e: "Praying al&s;o for
us, that God would open unto us a door
of utterance, to &s;peak the my&s;tery of
Chri&s;t, for which I am al&s;o <HI>in bonds.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">3. St. Paul bids Philemon prepare for
him a lodging: "For I tru&s;t," &s;ays he, "that,
through your prayers, I &s;hall be given
unto you." This agrees with the expecta|tion
of &s;peedy deliverance, which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in another epi&s;tle written during
the &s;ame impri&s;onment: "Him" (Timo|thy)
"I hope to &s;end pre&s;ently, &s;o &s;oon as
I &s;hall &s;ee how it will go with me; <HI>but I</HI>
<PB N="371" REF="375"><HI>tru&s;t in the Lord that I al&s;o my&s;elf &s;hall come
&s;hortly.</HI>" Phil. chap. ii. ver. 23, 24.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the letter to Philemon, and that to
the Colo&s;&s;ians, were written at the &s;ame
time, and &s;ent by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger, the
one to a particular inhabitant, the other to
the church of Colo&s;&s;e, it may be expected
that the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, per&s;ons
would be about St. Paul, and join with him,
as was the practice, in the &s;alutations of the
epi&s;tle. Accordingly we find the names of
Ari&s;tarchus, Marcus, Epaphras, Luke, and
Demas, in both epi&s;tles. Timothy, who is
joined with St. Paul in the &s;uper&s;cription of
the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, is joined with
him in this. Tychicus did not &s;alute Phi|lemon,
becau&s;e he accompanied the epi&s;tle
to Colo&s;&s;e, and would undoubtedly there
&s;ee him. Yet the reader of the epi&s;tle to
Philemon will remark one con&s;iderable di|ver&s;ity
in the catalogue of &s;aluting friends,
and which &s;hows that the catalogue was not
copied from that to the Colo&s;&s;ians. In the
epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, Ari&s;tarchus is called
by St. Paul his fellow-pri&s;oner, Colo&s;. chap.
iv. ver. 10; in the epi&s;tle to Philemon, Ari&s;|tarchus
<PB N="372" REF="376">
is mentioned without any addition,
and the title of fellow-pri&s;oner is given
to Epaphras<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ben&s;on ob&s;erves, and perhaps truly, that the appellation of fellow-pri&s;oner, as applied by St. Paul to Epaphras, did not imply that they were impri&s;oned to|gether <HI>at the time</HI>; any more than your calling a per&s;on your fellow-traveller, imports that you are then upon your travels. If he had, upon any former occa&s;ion, tra|velled with you, you might afterwards &s;peak of him under that title. It is ju&s;t &s;o with the term fellow-pri&s;oner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And let it al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that notwith|&s;tanding
the clo&s;e and circum&s;tantial agree|ment
between the two epi&s;tles, this is not
the ca&s;e of an opening left in a genuine
writing, which an impo&s;tor is induced to fill
up; nor of a reference to &s;ome writing not
extant, which &s;ets a &s;ophi&s;t at work to &s;up|ply
the lo&s;s, in like manner as, becau&s;e St.
Paul was &s;uppo&s;ed, Colo&s;. chap. iv. ver. 16,
to allude to an epi&s;tle written by him to the
Laodiceans, &s;ome per&s;on has from thence
taken the hint of uttering a forgery under
that title. The pre&s;ent, I &s;ay, is not that
ca&s;e; for Philemon's name is not mentioned
in the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians; One&s;imus's
&s;ervile condition is no where hinted at, any
<PB N="373" REF="377">
more than his crime, his flight, or the place
or time of his conver&s;ion. The &s;tory there|fore
of the epi&s;tle, if it be a fiction, is a fic|tion
to which the author could not have
been guided, by any thing he had read in
St. Paul's genuine writings.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>Ver. 4, 5. "I thank my God, making
mention of thee always in my prayers;
hearing of thy love and faith, which thou
ha&s;t toward the Lord Je&s;us, and toward
all &s;aints."</P>
<P>"<HI>Hearing of thy love and faith.</HI>" This is
the form of &s;peech which St. Paul was wont
to u&s;e towards tho&s;e churches which he had
not &s;een, or then vi&s;ited: &s;ee Rom. chap. i.
ver. 8; Ephe&s;. chap. i. ver. 15; Col. chap. i.
ver. 3, 4. Toward tho&s;e churches and
per&s;ons, with whom he was previou&s;ly ac|quainted,
he employed a different phra&s;e; as,
"I thank my God always on your behalf,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4; 2 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver.
3; or, "upon every <HI>remembrance</HI> of you,"
Phil. chap. i. ver. 3; 1 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver. 2,
<PB N="374" REF="378">
3; 2 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3; and never &s;peaks
<HI>of hearing of them.</HI> Yet, I think, it mu&s;t be
concluded, from the nineteenth ver&s;e of this
epi&s;tle, that Philemon had been converted by
St. Paul him&s;elf: "Albeit, I do not &s;ay to
thee, how <HI>thou owe&s;t unto me</HI> even thine
own &s;elf be&s;ides." Here then is a peculiarity.
Let us enquire whether the epi&s;tle &s;upplies
any circum&s;tance which will account for it.
We have &s;een that it may be made out, not
from the epi&s;tle it&s;elf, but from a compari&s;on
of the epi&s;tle with that to the Colo&s;&s;ians, that
Philemon was an inhabitant of Colo&s;&s;e; and
it farther appears, from the epi&s;tle to the Co|lo&s;&s;ians,
that St. Paul had never been in that
city: "I would that ye knew what great con|flict
I have for you and for them at Laodi|cea,
and for as many as have not &s;een my
face in the fle&s;h." Col. ch. ii. ver. 1. Al|though,
therefore, St. Paul had formerly met
with Philemon at &s;ome other place, and had
been the immediate in&s;trument of his con|ver&s;ion,
yet Philemon's faith and conduct
afterwards, ina&s;much as he lived in a city
which St. Paul had never vi&s;ited, could only
be known to him by fame and reputation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="375" REF="379">
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The tenderne&s;s and delicacy of this epi&s;tle
have been long admired: "Though I might
be much bold in Chri&s;t to enjoin thee that
which is convenient, yet for love's &s;ake
I rather be&s;eech thee, being &s;uch a one as
Paul the aged, and now al&s;o a pri&s;oner of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I be&s;eech thee for my &s;on
One&s;imus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds." There is &s;omething certainly very
melting and per&s;ua&s;ive in this, and every
part of the epi&s;tle. Yet, in my opinion,
the character of St. Paul prevails in it
throughout. The warm, affectionate, au|thoritative
teacher is interceding with an
ab&s;ent friend for a beloved convert. He
urges his &s;uit with an earne&s;tne&s;s, befitting
perhaps not &s;o much the occa&s;ion, as the ar|dour
and &s;en&s;ibility of his own mind. Here
al&s;o, as every where, he &s;hows him&s;elf con|&s;cious
of the weight and dignity of his mi&s;|&s;ion;
nor does he &s;uffer Philemon for a mo|ment
to forget it: "I <HI>might</HI> be much bold
in Chri&s;t to enjoin thee that which is
<PB N="376" REF="380">
convenient." He is careful al&s;o to recal,
though obliquely, to Philemon's memory,
the &s;acred obligation under which he had
laid him, by bringing to him the knowledge
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: "I do not &s;ay to thee, how
thou owe&s;t to me even thine own &s;elf
be&s;ides." Without laying a&s;ide, there|fore,
the apo&s;tolic character, our author &s;of|tens
the imperative &s;tyle of his addre&s;s, by
mixing with it every &s;entiment and con&s;i|deration
that could move the heart of his
corre&s;pondent. Aged and in pri&s;on, he is
content to &s;upplicate and entreat. One&s;i|mus
was rendered dear to him by his con|ver&s;ion
and his &s;ervices; the child of his
affliction, and "mini&s;tering unto him in the
bonds of the go&s;pel." This ought to re|commend
him, whatever had been his fault,
to Philemon's forgivene&s;s: "Receive him as
my&s;elf, as my own bowels." Every thing,
however, &s;hould be voluntary. St. Paul
was determined that Philemon's compliance
&s;hould flow from his own bounty: "With|out

<HEAD>THE SUBSCRIPTIONS OF THE EPISTLES.</HEAD>
<P>SIX of the&s;e <HI>&s;ub&s;criptions</HI> are fal&s;e or im|probable;
that is, they are either ab&s;o|lutely
contradicted by the contents of the
epi&s;tle, or are difficult to be reconciled
with them.</P>
<P N="1">I. The &s;ub&s;cription of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians &s;tates that it was written from
Philippi, notwith&s;tanding that, in the &s;ix|teenth
chapter and the eighth ver&s;e of the
epi&s;tle, St. Paul informs the Corinthians,
that he will "tarry at Ephe&s;us until Pente|co&s;t;"
and notwith&s;tanding that he begins
the &s;alutations in the epi&s;tle, by telling them
"the churches of A&s;ia &s;alute you;" a pretty
evident indication that he him&s;elf was in
A&s;ia at this time.</P>
<P N="2">II. The epi&s;tle to the Galatians is by the
&s;ub&s;cription dated from Rome; yet, in the
epi&s;tle it&s;elf, St. Paul expre&s;&s;es his &s;urpri&s;e
<PB N="379" REF="383">
"that they were <HI>&s;o &s;oon</HI> removed from him
that called them;" whereas his journey to
Rome was ten years po&s;terior to the con|ver&s;ion
of the Galatians. And what, I
think, is more conclu&s;ive, the author, though
&s;peaking of him&s;elf in this more than any
other epi&s;tle, does not once mention his
bonds, or call him&s;elf a pri&s;oner; which he
has not failed to do in every one of the four
epi&s;tles written from that city, and during
that impri&s;onment.</P>
<P N="3">III. The fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians
was written, the &s;ub&s;cription tells us, from
Athens; yet the epi&s;tle refers expre&s;sly to
the coming of Timotheus from The&s;&s;alo|nica
(ch. iii. ver. 6); and the hi&s;tory in|forms
us, Acts xviii. ver. 5, that Timo|thy
came out of Macedonia to St. Paul at
<HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alo|nians
is dated, and without any di&s;cover|able
rea&s;on, from Athens al&s;o. If it be
truly the <HI>&s;econd</HI>; if it refer, as it appears to
do (ch. ii. ver. 2), to the fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t
was written from Corinth, the place mu&s;t
be erroneou&s;ly a&s;&s;igned, for the hi&s;tory does
<PB N="380" REF="384">
not allow us to &s;uppo&s;e that St. Paul, after he
had reached Corinth, went back to Athens.</P>
<P N="5">V. The fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy the &s;ub|&s;cription
a&s;&s;erts to have been &s;ent from Lao|dicea;
yet, when St. Paul writes, "I be|&s;ought
thee to abide &s;till at Ephe&s;us,
<GAP DESC="foreign"> (when I &s;et
out for Macedonia)," the reader is na|turally
led to conclude, that he wrote the
letter upon his arrival in that country.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The epi&s;tle to Titus is dated from
Nicopolis in Macedonia, whil&s;t no city of
that name is known to have exi&s;ted in that
province.</P>
<P>The u&s;e, and the only u&s;e, which I make
of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, is to &s;how, how ea&s;ily
errors and contradictions &s;teal in where the
writer is not guided by original knowledge.
There are only eleven di&s;tinct a&s;&s;ignments
of date to St. Paul's epi&s;tles (for the four
written from Rome may be con&s;idered as
plainly cotemporary); and of the&s;e, &s;ix &s;eem
to be erroneous. I do not attribute any
authority to the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions. I believe
them to have been conjectures founded
&s;ometimes upon loo&s;e traditions, but more
<PB N="381" REF="385">
generally upon a con&s;ideration of &s;ome par|ticular
text, without &s;ufficiently comparing
it with other parts of the epi&s;tle, with diffe|rent
epi&s;tles, or with the hi&s;tory. Suppo&s;e
then that the &s;ub&s;criptions had come down
to us as authentic parts of the epi&s;tles, there
would have been more contrarieties and dif|ficulties
ari&s;ing out of the&s;e final ver&s;es, than
from all the re&s;t of the volume. Yet, if the
epi&s;tles had been forged, the whole mu&s;t
have been made up of the &s;ame elements as
tho&s;e of which the &s;ub&s;criptions are com|po&s;ed,
viz. tradition, conjecture, and infe|rence:
and it would have remained to be
accounted for, how, whil&s;t &s;o many errors
were crowded into the concluding clau&s;es of
the letters, &s;o much con&s;i&s;tency &s;hould be
pre&s;erved in other parts.</P>
<P>The &s;ame reflection ari&s;es from ob&s;erving
the over&s;ights and mi&s;takes which learned
men have committed, when arguing upon
allu&s;ions which relate to time and place, or
when endeavouring to dige&s;t &s;cattered cir|cum&s;tances
into a continued &s;tory. It is
indeed the &s;ame ca&s;e; for the&s;e &s;ub&s;crip|tions
mu&s;t be regarded as ancient &s;cholia,
<PB N="382" REF="386">
and as nothing more. Of this liability to
error I can pre&s;ent the reader with a no|table
in&s;tance; and which I bring forward
for no other purpo&s;e than that to which
I apply the erroneous &s;ub&s;criptions. Ludo|vicus
Capellus, in that part of his Hi&s;toria Apo|&s;tolica
Illu&s;trata, which is entitled <HI>De Ordine</HI>
Epi&s;t. Paul. writing upon the &s;econd epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, triumphs unmercifully
over the want of &s;agacity in Baronius, who,
it &s;eems, makes St. Paul write his epi&s;tle to
Titus from Macedonia upon his &s;econd vi&s;it
into that province; whereas it appears from
the hi&s;tory, that Titus, in&s;tead of being in
Crete where the epi&s;tle places him, was at
that time &s;ent by the apo&s;tle from Mace|donia
to Corinth. "Animadvertere e&s;t,"
&s;ays Capellus, "magnam hominis illius
<GAP DESC="foreign">, qui vult Titum a Paulo in Cre|tam
abductum, illicque relictum, cum inde
Nicopolim navigaret, quem tamen agno&s;cit
a Paulo ex Macedoni&acirc; mi&s;&s;um e&s;&s;e Corin|thum."
This probably will be thought
a detection of incon&s;i&s;tency in Baronius.
But what is the mo&s;t remarkable, is, that
in the &s;ame chapter in which he thus in|dulges
his contempt of Baronius's judg|ment,
<PB N="383" REF="387">
Capellus him&s;elf falls into an error of
the &s;ame kind, and more gro&s;s and palpable
than that which he reproves. For he be|gins
the chapter by &s;tating the &s;econd
epi&s;tle to the Corinthians and the fir&s;t epi&s;tle
to Timothy to be nearly cotemporary; to
have been both written during the apo&s;tle's
&s;econd vi&s;it into Macedonia; and that a
doubt &s;ub&s;i&s;ted concerning the immediate
priority of their dates: "Po&s;terior ad eo&s;dem
Corinthios epi&s;tola, et prior ad Timo|theum
certant de prioritate, et &s;ub judice
lis e&s;t; utraque autem &s;cripta e&s;t paulo
po&s;tquam Paulus Ephe&s;o di&s;ce&s;&s;i&s;&s;et, adeo|que
dum Macedoniam peragraret, &s;ed
utra tempore praecedat, non liquet." Now,
in the fir&s;t place, it is highly improbable
that the two epi&s;tles &s;hould have been writ|ten
either nearly together, or during the
&s;ame journey through Macedonia; for in
the epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, Timothy ap|pears
to have been <HI>with</HI> St. Paul: in the
epi&s;tle addre&s;&s;ed to him, to have been left be|hind
at Ephe&s;us, and not only left behind,
but directed to continue there, till St. Paul
&s;hould return to that city. In the &s;econd
<PB N="384" REF="388">
place it is inconceivable, that a que&s;tion
&s;hould be propo&s;ed concerning the priority
of date of the two epi&s;tles; for, when St.
Paul, in his epi&s;tle to Timothy, opens his ad|dre&s;s
to him by &s;aying, "as I be&s;ought thee
to abide &s;till at Ephe&s;us when I went into
Macedonia," no reader can doubt but
that he here refers to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> interview
which had pa&s;&s;ed between them; that he
had not &s;een him &s;ince; whereas if the
epi&s;tle be po&s;terior to that to the Co|rinthians,
yet written upon the &s;ame vi&s;it
into Macedonia, this could not be true; for
as Timothy was along with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians, he
mu&s;t, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, have pa&s;&s;ed
over to St. Paul in Macedonia after he had
been left by him at Ephe&s;us, and mu&s;t
have returned to Ephe&s;us again before the
epi&s;tle was written. What mi&s;led Ludo|vicus
Capellus was &s;imply this, that he had
entirely overlooked Timothy's name in the
&s;uper&s;cription of the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians. Which over&s;ight appears not
only in the quotation which we have given,
<PB N="385" REF="389">
but from his telling us, as he does, that
Timothy came from Ephe&s;us to St. Paul at
<HI>Corinth,</HI> whereas the &s;uper&s;cription proves
that Timothy was already with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians from
Macedonia.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the out&s;et of this enquiry, the reader
was directed to con&s;ider the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles and the thirteen epi&s;tles of St. Paul
as certain ancient manu&s;cripts lately di&s;co|vered
in the clo&s;et of &s;ome celebrated library.
We have adhered to this view of the &s;ub|ject.
External evidence of every kind has
been removed out of &s;ight; and our endea|vours
have been employed to collect the in|dications
of truth and authenticity, which
appeared to exi&s;t in the writings them&s;elves,
and to re&s;ult from a compari&s;on of their
different parts. It is not however nece&s;&s;ary
to continue this &s;uppo&s;ition longer. The te&s;|timony
which other remains of cotemporary,
or the monuments of adjoining ages afford
to the reception, notoriety, and public e&s;ti|mation
of a book, form no doubt the fir&s;t
proof of its genuinene&s;s. And in no books
whatever is this proof more complete, than
<PB N="387" REF="391">
in tho&s;e at pre&s;ent under our con&s;ideration.
The enquiries of learned men, and, above
all, of the excellent Lardner, who never
over&s;tates a point of evidence, and who&s;e
fidelity in citing his authorities has in no
one in&s;tance been impeached, have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
concerning the&s;e writings, the fol|lowing
propo&s;itions:</P>
<P N="1">I. That in the age immediately po&s;terior
to that in which St. Paul lived, his letters
were publickly read and acknowledged.</P>
<P>Some of them are quoted or alluded to
by almo&s;t every Chri&s;tian writer that fol|lowed,
by Clement of Rome, by Hermas,
by Ignatius, by Polycarp, di&s;ciples or co|temporaries
of the apo&s;tles; by Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr,
by the churches of Gaul, by Irenaeus,
by Athenagoras, by Theophilus, by Cle|ment
of Alexandria, by Hermias, by Ter|tullian,
who occupied the &s;ucceeding age.
Now when we find a book quoted or re|ferred
to by an ancient author, we are en|titled
to conclude, that it was read and re|ceived
in the age and country in which that
author lived. And this conclu&s;ion does not,
in any degree, re&s;t upon the judgment or
<PB N="388" REF="392">
character of the author making &s;uch refe|rence.
Proceeding by this rule, we have,
concerning the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corin|thians
in particular, within forty years after
the epi&s;tle was written, evidence, not only
of its being extant at Corinth, but of its
being known and read at Rome. Clement,
bi&s;hop of that city, writing to the church
of Corinth, u&s;es the&s;e words: "Take into
your hands the epi&s;tle of the ble&s;&s;ed Paul
the apo&s;tle. What did he at fir&s;t write
unto you in the beginning of the go&s;pel?
Verily he did by the &s;pirit admoni&s;h you
concerning him&s;elf and Cephas and Apol|los,
becau&s;e that even then you did form
parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 22.</NOTE>." This was written at a time
when probably &s;ome mu&s;t have been living
at Corinth, who remembered St. Paul's mi|ni&s;try
there and the receipt of the epi&s;tle.
The te&s;timony is &s;till more valuable, as it
&s;hows that the epi&s;tles were pre&s;erved in
the churches to which they were &s;ent, and
that they were &s;pread and propagated from
them to the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian commu|nity.
Agreeably to which natural mode
<PB N="389" REF="393">
and order of their publication, Tertullian,
a century afterwards, for proof of the inte|grity
and genuinene&s;s of the apo&s;tolic writ|ings,
bids "any one, who is willing to exer|ci&s;e
his curio&s;ity profitably in the bu&s;ine&s;s
of their &s;alvation, to vi&s;it the apo&s;tolical
churches, in which their very authentic
letters are recited, ip&s;ae authenticae literae
eorum recitantur." Then he goes on: "Is
Achaia near you? You have Corinth. If
you are not far from Macedonia, you have
Philippi, you have The&s;&s;alonica. If you
can go to A&s;ia, you have Ephe&s;us; but if
you are near to Italy, you have Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 598.</NOTE>."
I adduce this pa&s;&s;age to &s;how, that the di&s;tinct
churches or Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, to which St.
Paul's epi&s;tles were &s;ent, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome
ages afterwards; that his &s;everal epi&s;tles were
all along re&s;pectively read in tho&s;e churches;
that Chri&s;tians at large received them from
tho&s;e churches, and appealed to tho&s;e
churches for their original and authenticity.</P>
<P>Arguing in like manner from citations
and allu&s;ions, we have, within the &s;pace of
a hundred and fifty years from the time
<PB N="390" REF="394">
that the fir&s;t of St. Paul's epi&s;tles was writ|ten,
proofs of almo&s;t all of them being read,
in Pale&s;tine, Syria, the countries of A&s;ia
Minor, in Egypt, in that part of Africa
which u&s;ed the Latin tongue, in Greece,
Italy, and Gaul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</NOTE>. I do not mean &s;imply
to a&s;&s;ert, that, within the &s;pace of a hun|dred
and fifty years, St. Paul's epi&s;tles were
read in tho&s;e countries, for I believe that
they were read and circulated from the be|ginning;
but that proofs of their being &s;o
read occur within that period. And when
it is con&s;idered how few of the primitive
Chri&s;tians wrote, and of what was written
how much is lo&s;t, we are to account it ex|traordinary,
or rather as a &s;ure proof of the
exten&s;ivene&s;s of the reputation of the&s;e
writings, and of the general re&s;pect in
which they were held, that &s;o many te&s;ti|monies,
and of &s;uch antiquity, are &s;till ex|tant.
"In the remaining works of Ire|naeus,
Clement of Alexandria, and Ter|tullian,
there are perhaps more and
larger quotations of the &s;mall volume of
the New Te&s;tament, than of all the works
<PB N="391" REF="395">
of Cicero, in the writings of all characters
for &s;everal ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</NOTE>." We mu&s;t add, that
the epi&s;tles of Paul come in for their full
&s;hare of this ob&s;ervation; and that all the
thirteen epi&s;tles, except that to Philemon,
which is not quoted by Irenaeus or Clement,
and which probably e&s;caped notice merely
by its brevity, are &s;everally cited, and ex|pre&s;sly
recognized as St. Paul's, by each of
the&s;e Chri&s;tian writers. The Ebionites, an
early, though incon&s;iderable Chri&s;tian &s;ect,
rejected St. Paul and his epi&s;tles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 808.</NOTE>; that is,
they rejected the&s;e epi&s;tles, not becau&s;e they
were not, but becau&s;e they were St. Paul's;
and becau&s;e, adhering to the obligation of
the Jewi&s;h law, they cho&s;e to di&s;pute his
doctrine and authority. Their &s;uffrage as
to the genuinene&s;s of the epi&s;tles does not
contradict that of other Chri&s;tians. Mar|cion,
an heretical writer in the former part
of the &s;econd century, is &s;aid by Tertullian to
have rejected three of the epi&s;tles which we
now receive, viz. the two epi&s;tles to Timo|thy
and the epi&s;tle to Titus. It appears to
<PB N="392" REF="396">
me not improbable, that Marcion might
make &s;ome &s;uch di&s;tinction as this, that no
apo&s;tolic epi&s;tle was to be admitted which
was not read or atte&s;ted by the church to
which it was &s;ent; for it is remarkable that,
together with the&s;e epi&s;tles to private per|&s;ons,
he rejected al&s;o the catholic epi&s;tles.
Now the catholic epi&s;tles and the epi&s;tles to
private per&s;ons agree in the circum&s;tance of
wanting this particular &s;pecies of atte&s;tation.
Marcion, it &s;eems, acknowledged the epi&s;tle
to Philemon, and is upbraided for his incon|&s;i&s;tency
in doing &s;o by Tertullian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 455.</NOTE>, who
a&s;ks "why, when he received a letter writ|ten
to a &s;ingle per&s;on, he &s;hould refu&s;e
two to Timothy and one to Titus com|po&s;ed
upon the affairs of the church?"
This pa&s;&s;age &s;o far favours our account of
Marcion's objection, as it &s;hows that the
objection was &s;uppo&s;ed by Tertullian to
have been founded in &s;omething, which be|longed
to the nature of a private letter.</P>
<P>Nothing of the works of Marcion re|mains.
Probably he was, after all, a ra&s;h,
arbitrary, licentious critic (if he de&s;erved
<PB N="393" REF="397">
indeed the name of critic) and who offered
no rea&s;on for his determination. What St.
Jerome &s;ays of him intimates this, and is be|&s;ide
founded in good &s;en&s;e; &s;peaking of him
and Ba&s;ilides, "if they had a&s;&s;igned any rea|&s;ons,"
&s;ays he, "why they did not reckon
the&s;e epi&s;tles," viz. the fir&s;t and &s;econd to
Timothy and the epi&s;tle to Titus, "to be
the apo&s;tle's, we would have endeavoured
to have an&s;wered them, and perhaps
might have &s;atisfied the reader; but when
they take upon them, by their own au|thority,
to pronounce one epi&s;tle to be
Paul's, and another not, they can only be
replied to in the &s;ame manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 458.</NOTE>." Let it be
remembered, however, that Marcion re|ceived
ten of the&s;e epi&s;tles. His authority
therefore, even if his credit had been better
than it is, forms a very &s;mall exception to
the uniformity of the evidence. Of Ba&s;ilides
we know &s;till le&s;s than we do of Marcion.
The &s;ame ob&s;ervation however belongs to
him, viz. that his objection, as far as appears
from this pa&s;&s;age of St. Jerome, was con|fined
<PB N="394" REF="398">
to the three private epi&s;tles. Yet is
this the only opinion which can be &s;aid to
di&s;turb the con&s;ent of the two fir&s;t centuries
of the Chri&s;tian aera; for as to Tatian, who
is reported by Jerome alone to have reject|ed
&s;ome of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, the extrava|gant
or rather delirious notions into which
he fell, take away all weight and credit from
his judgment. If, indeed, Jerome's account
of this circum&s;tance be correct; for it ap|pears
from much older writers than Jerome,
that Tatian owned and u&s;ed many of the&s;e
epi&s;tles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. i. p. 313.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. They, who in tho&s;e ages di&s;puted about
&s;o many other points, agreed in acknow|ledging
the &s;criptures now before us. Con|tending
&s;ects appealed to them in their con|trover&s;ies
with equal and unre&s;erved &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.
When they were urged by one
&s;ide, however they might be interpreted or
mi&s;interpreted by the other, their authority
was not que&s;tioned: "Reliqui omnes," &s;ays
Irenaeus, &s;peaking of Marcion, "fal&s;o &s;ci|entiae
nomine inflati, &s;cripturas quidem
<PB N="395" REF="399">
confitentur, interpretationes vero conver|tunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. adver&s;. Haer. quoted by Lardner, vol. xv. p. 425.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="3">III. When the genuinene&s;s of &s;ome other
writings which were in circulation, and
even of a few which are now received into
the canon, was conte&s;ted, the&s;e were never
called into di&s;pute. Whatever was the ob|jection,
or whether, in truth, there ever was
any real objection to the authenticity of the
&s;econd epi&s;tle of Peter, the &s;econd and third
of John, the epi&s;tle of James, or that of
Jude, or to the book of the Revelations of
St. John, the doubts that appear to have
been entertained concerning them, exceed|ingly
&s;trengthen the force of the te&s;timony
as to tho&s;e writings, about which there was
no doubt; becau&s;e it &s;hows, that the matter
was a &s;ubject, among&s;t the early Chri&s;tians,
of examination and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and that,
where there was any room to doubt, they
did doubt.</P>
<P>What Eu&s;ebius hath left upon the &s;ub|ject
is directly to the purpo&s;e of this ob|&s;ervation.
Eu&s;ebius, it is well known, di|vided
<PB N="396" REF="400">
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical writings which were
extant in his time into three cla&s;&s;es; the

them in one chapter; or "&s;criptures uni|ver&s;ally
acknowledged," as he calls them
in another; the "controverted, yet well
known and approved by many;" and
"the &s;purious." What were the &s;hades of

IV. That no ancient writing, which is
atte&s;ted as the&s;e epi&s;tles are, hath had its
authenticity di&s;proved, or is in fact que&s;|tioned.
The controver&s;ies which have been
moved concerning &s;u&s;pected writings, as the
epi&s;tles, for in&s;tance, of Phalaris, or the
eighteen epi&s;tles of Cicero, begin by &s;how|ing
that this atte&s;tation is wanting. That
being proved, the que&s;tion is thrown back
upon internal marks of &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s or au|thenticity;
and in the&s;e the di&s;pute is occu|pied.
In which di&s;putes it is to be ob|&s;erved,
that the conte&s;ted writings are com|monly
attacked by arguments drawn from
&s;ome oppo&s;ition which they betray to "au|thentic
hi&s;tory," to "true epi&s;tles," to "the
real &s;entiments or circum&s;tances of the au|thor
whom they per&s;onate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tracts written in the controver&s;y between Tun&s;tal and Middleton upon certain &s;u&s;pected epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to Cicero.</NOTE>;" which au|thentic
hi&s;tory, which true epi&s;tles, which
real &s;entiments them&s;elves, are no other
than ancient documents, who&s;e early exi&s;t|ence
and reception can be proved, in the
manner in which the writings before us
<PB N="398" REF="402">
are traced up to the age of their reputed
author, or to ages near to his. A modern
who &s;its down to compo&s;e the hi&s;tory of
&s;ome ancient period, has no &s;tronger evi|dence
to appeal to for the mo&s;t confident
a&s;&s;ertion, or the mo&s;t undi&s;puted fact, that
he delivers, than writings, who&s;e genuine|ne&s;s
is proved by the &s;ame medium through
which we evince the authenticity of ours.
Nor, whil&s;t he can have recour&s;e to &s;uch
authorities as the&s;e, does he apprehend any
uncertainty in his accounts, from the &s;u&s;|picion
of &s;puriou&s;ne&s;s or impo&s;ture in his
materials.</P>
<P N="5">V. It cannot be &s;hown that any forgeries
properly &s;o called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I believe that there is a great deal of truth in Dr. Lardner's ob&s;ervations, that comparatively few of tho&s;e books, which we call apocryphal, were &s;trictly and originally forgeries. See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 167.</NOTE>, that is, writings pub|li&s;hed
under the name of the per&s;on who
did not compo&s;e them, made their appear|ance
in the fir&s;t century of the Chri&s;tian aera,
in which century the&s;e epi&s;tles undoubtedly
exi&s;ted. I &s;hall &s;et down under this pro|po&s;ition
the guarded words of Lardner him|&s;elf:
<PB N="399" REF="403">
"There are no quotations of any of
them (&s;purious and apocryphal books) in
the apo&s;tolical fathers, by whom I mean
Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas,
Ignatius, and Polycarp, who&s;e writings
reach from the year of our Lord 70 to
the year 108. <HI>I &s;ay this confidently, becau&s;e
I think it has been proved.</HI>" Lardner,
vol. xii. p. 158.</P>
<P>Nor when they did appear were they
much u&s;ed by the primitive Chri&s;tians,
"Irenaeus quotes not any of the&s;e books.
He mentions &s;ome of them, but he never
quotes them. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of
Tertullian: he has mentioned a book
called "Acts of Paul and Thecla;" but it is
only to condemn it. Clement of Alexan|dria
and Origen have mentioned and quot|ed
&s;everal &s;uch books, but never as autho|rity,
and &s;ometimes with expre&s;s marks of
di&s;like. Eu&s;ebius quotes no &s;uch books
in any of his works. He has mentioned
them indeed, but how? Not by way of
approbation, but to &s;how that they were
of little or no value; and that they never
were received by the &s;ounder part of
<PB N="400" REF="404">
Chri&s;tians." Now, if with this, which is
advanced after the mo&s;t minute and diligent
examination, we compare what the &s;ame
cautious writer had before &s;aid of our re|ceived
&s;criptures, "that in the works of
three only of the above-mentioned fa|thers,
there are more and larger quota|tions
of the &s;mall volume of the New
Te&s;tament, than of all the works of Ci|cero
in the writers of all characters for
&s;everal ages;" and if, with the marks of ob|&s;curity
or condemnation, which accompa|nied
the mention of the &s;everal apocryphal
Chri&s;tian writings, when they happened
to be mentioned at all, we contra&s;t what
Dr. Lardner's work completely and in detail
makes out concerning the writings which
we defend, and what, having &s;o made out,
he thought him&s;elf authorized in his con|clu&s;ion
to a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e books were not
only received from the beginning, but
received with the greate&s;t re&s;pect; have
been publickly and &s;olemnly read in the a&s;|&s;emblies
of Chri&s;tians throughout the world,
in every age from that time to this; early
tran&s;lated into the languages of divers coun|tries
<PB N="401" REF="405">
and people; commentaries writ to ex|plain
and illu&s;trate them; quoted by way
of proof in all arguments of a religious na|ture;
recommended to the peru&s;al of unbe|lievers,
as containing the authentic account
of the Chri&s;tian doctrine; when we attend,
I &s;ay, to this repre&s;entation, we perceive in
it, not only full proof of the early notoriety
of the&s;e books, but a clear and &s;en&s;ible line
of di&s;crimination, which &s;eparates the&s;e from
the preten&s;ions of any others.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tles of St. Paul &s;tand particularly
free of any doubt or confu&s;ion that might
ari&s;e from this &s;ource. Until the conclu|&s;ion
of the fourth century, no intimation
appears of any attempt whatever being
made to counterfeit the&s;e writings; and
then it appears only of a &s;ingle and ob&s;cure
in&s;tance. Jerome, who flouri&s;hed in the
year 392, has this expre&s;&s;ion: "Legunt qui|dam
et ad Laodicen&s;es; &s;ed ab omnibus
exploditur;" there is al&s;o an epi&s;tle to the
Laodiceans, but it is rejected by every
body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. x. p. 103.</NOTE>. Theodoret, who wrote in the year
423, &s;peaks of this epi&s;tle in the &s;ame
<PB N="402" REF="406">
terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lardner, vol. xi. p. 88.</NOTE>. Be&s;ide the&s;e I know not whether
any ancient writer mentions it. It was cer|tainly
unnoticed during the three fir&s;t cen|turies
of the church; and when it came af|terwards
to be mentioned, it was mentioned
only to &s;how, that, though &s;uch a writing
did exi&s;t, it obtained no credit. It is pro|bable
that the forgery to which Jerome al|ludes,
is the epi&s;tle which we now have un|der
that title. If &s;o, as hath been already
ob&s;erved, it is nothing more than a collec|tion
of &s;entences from the genuine epi&s;tles;
and was perhaps, at fir&s;t, rather the exerci&s;e
of &s;ome idle pen, than any &s;erious attempt
to impo&s;e a forgery upon the public. Of
an epi&s;tle to the Corinthians under St. Paul's
name, which was brought into Europe in
the pre&s;ent century, antiquity is entirely &s;i|lent.
It was unheard of for &s;ixteen cen|turies;
and at this day, though it be extant,
and was fir&s;t found in the Armenian lan|guage,
it is not, by the Chri&s;tians of that
country, received into their &s;criptures. I
hope, after this, that there is no reader who
will think there is any competition of cre|dit,
<PB N="403" REF="407">
or of external proof, between the&s;e and
the received epi&s;tles; or rather who will
not acknowledge the evidence of authenti|city
to be confirmed by the want of &s;ucce&s;s
which attended impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>When we take into our hands the letters
which the &s;uffrage and con&s;ent of antiquity
hath thus tran&s;mitted to us, the fir&s;t thing
that &s;trikes our attention is the air of reality
and bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and
conviction, which pervades the whole. Let
the &s;ceptic read them. If he be not &s;en|&s;ible
of the&s;e qualities in them, the argu|ment
can have no weight with him. If he
be; if he perceive in almo&s;t every page the
language of a mind, actuated by real occa|&s;ions,
and operating upon real circum|&s;tances,
I would wi&s;h it to be ob&s;erved, that
the proof which ari&s;es from this perception
is not to be deemed occult or imaginary,
becau&s;e it is incapable of being drawn out
in words, or of being conveyed to the ap|prehen&s;ion
of the reader in any other way,
than by &s;ending him to the books them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>And here, in its proper place, comes in
<PB N="404" REF="408">
the argument which it has been the office of
the&s;e pages to unfold. St. Paul's epi&s;tles
are connected with his hi&s;tory by their par|ticularity,
and by the numerous circum|&s;tances
which are found in them. When
we de&s;cend to an examination and compa|rion
of the&s;e circum&s;tances, we not only
ob&s;erve the hi&s;tory and the epi&s;tles to be
independent documents, unknown to, or at
lea&s;t uncon&s;ulted by, each other, but we find
the &s;ub&s;tance, and oftentimes very minute
articles, of the hi&s;tory, recognized in the
epi&s;tles, by allu&s;ions and references, which
can neither be imputed to <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> nor, with|out
a foundation in truth, be accounted for
by accident, by hints and expre&s;&s;ions and
&s;ingle words dropping as it were fortui|tou&s;ly
from the pen of the writer, or drawn
forth, each by &s;ome occa&s;ion proper to the
place in which it occurs, but widely re|moved
from any view to con&s;i&s;tency or
agreement. The&s;e, we know, are effects
which reality naturally produces, but which,
without reality at the bottom, can hardly
be conceived to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>When therefore, with a body of external
<PB N="405" REF="409">
evidence, which is relied upon, and which ex|perience
proves may &s;afely be relied upon, in
appreciating the credit of ancient writings,
we combine characters of genuinene&s;s and
originality which are not found, and which,
in the nature and order of things, cannot be
expected to be found in &s;purious compo|&s;itions;
whatever difficulties we may meet
with in other topics of the Chri&s;tian evi|dence,
we can have little in yielding our
a&s;&s;ent to the following conclu&s;ions: that
there was &s;uch a per&s;on as St. Paul; that he
lived in the age which we a&s;cribe to him;
that he went about preaching the religion of
which Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the founder; and that
the letters which we now read were actually
written by him upon the &s;ubject, and in the
cour&s;e, of that his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And if it be true that we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the very letters which St. Paul wrote, let us
con&s;ider what confirmation they afford to
the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory. In my opinion they
&s;ub&s;tantiate the whole tran&s;action. The
great object of modern re&s;earch is to come at
the epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence of the times.
A mid&s;t the ob&s;curities, the &s;ilence, or the
<PB N="406" REF="410">
contradictions of hi&s;tory, if a letter can be
found, we regard it as the di&s;covery of a
land-mark; as that by which we can correct,
adju&s;t, or &s;upply the imperfections and un|certainties
of other accounts. One cau&s;e
of the &s;uperior credit which is attributed to
letters is this, that the facts which they
di&s;clo&s;e generally come out <HI>incidentally,</HI> and
therefore without de&s;ign to mi&s;lead the pub|lic
by fal&s;e or exaggerated accounts. This
rea&s;on may be applied to St. Paul's epi&s;tles
with as much ju&s;tice as to any letters what|ever.
Nothing could be farther from the
intention of the writer than to record any
part of his hi&s;tory. That his hi&s;tory was
<HI>in fact</HI> made public by the&s;e letters, and has
by the &s;ame means been tran&s;mitted to fu|ture
ages, is a &s;econdary and unthought of
effect. The &s;incerity therefore of the
apo&s;tle's declarations cannot rea&s;onably be
di&s;puted; at lea&s;t we are &s;ure that it was not
vitiated by any de&s;ire of &s;etting him&s;elf off
to the public at large. But the&s;e letters
form a part of the muniments of Chri&s;tia|nity,
as much to be valued for their con|tents,
as for their originality. A more in|e&s;timable
<PB N="407" REF="411">
trea&s;ure the care of antiquity could
not have &s;ent down to us. Be&s;ide the proof
they afford of the general reality of St.
Paul's hi&s;tory, of the knowledge which the
author of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles had ob|tained
of that hi&s;tory, and the con&s;equent
probability that he was, what he profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf
to have been, a companion of the apo&s;tle's;
be&s;ide the &s;upport they lend to the&s;e impor|tant
inferences, they meet &s;peci&s;ically &s;ome
of the principal objections upon which
the adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity have thought
proper to rely. In particular they &s;how,</P>
<P N="1">I. That Chri&s;tianity was not a &s;tory &s;et
on foot amid&s;t the confu&s;ions which attend|ed
and immediately preceded the de&s;truc|tion
of Jeru&s;alem; when many extravagant
reports were circulated, when men's minds
were broken by terror and di&s;tre&s;s, when
amid&s;t the tumults that &s;urrounded them en|quiry
was impracticable. The&s;e letters &s;how
inconte&s;tably that the religion had &s;ixed and
e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf before this &s;tate of things
took place.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whereas it hath been in&s;inuated, that
our go&s;pels may have been made up of re|ports
<PB N="408" REF="412">
and &s;tories, which were current at the
time, we may ob&s;erve that, with re&s;pect to
the epi&s;tles, this is impo&s;&s;ible. A man can|not
write the hi&s;tory of his own life from
reports; nor, what is the &s;ame thing, be led
by reports to refer to pa&s;&s;ages and tran&s;ac|tions
in which he &s;tates him&s;elf to have been
immediately pre&s;ent and active. I do not
allow that this in&s;inuation is applied to the
hi&s;torical part of the New Te&s;tament with
any colour of ju&s;tice or probability; but
I &s;ay, that to the epi&s;tles it is not appli|cable
at all.</P>
<P N="3">III. The&s;e letters prove that the converts
to Chri&s;tianity were not drawn from the bar|barous,
the mean, or the ignorant &s;et of
men, which the repre&s;entations of infidelity
would &s;ometimes make them. We learn
from letters the character not only of the
writer, but, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the per&s;ons
to whom they are written. To &s;uppo&s;e
that the&s;e letters were addre&s;&s;ed to a rude
tribe, incapable of thought or reflection,
is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as to &s;uppo&s;e Locke's
E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding to have
been written for the in&s;truction of &s;avages.
<PB N="409" REF="413">
Whatever may be thought of the&s;e letters
in other re&s;pects, either of diction or argu|ment,
they are certainly removed as far as
po&s;&s;ible from the habits and comprehen&s;ion
of a barbarous people.</P>
<P N="4">IV. St. Paul's hi&s;tory, I mean &s;o much of
it as may be collected from his letters, is &s;o
<HI>implicated</HI> with that of the other apo&s;tles,
and with the &s;ub&s;tance indeed of the Chri&s;|tian
hi&s;tory it&s;elf, that I apprehend it will
be found impo&s;&s;ible to admit St. Paul's &s;tory
(I do not &s;peak of the miraculous part of it)
to be true, and yet to reject the re&s;t as fa|bulous.
For in&s;tance, can any one believe
that there was &s;uch a man as Paul, a preacher
of Chri&s;tianity in the age which we a&s;&s;ign to
him, and <HI>not</HI> believe that there were al&s;o at
the &s;ame time &s;uch men as Peter and James,
and other apo&s;tles, who had been compa|nions
of Chri&s;t during his life, and who af|ter
his death publi&s;hed and avowed the
&s;ame things concerning him which Paul
taught? Judea, and e&s;pecially Jeru&s;alem,
was the &s;cene of Chri&s;t's mini&s;try. The
witne&s;&s;es of his miracles lived there. St.
Paul, by his own account, as well as that of
<PB N="410" REF="414">
his hi&s;torian, appears to have frequently vi|&s;ited
this city; to have carried on a commu|nication
with the church there; to have a&s;|&s;ociated
with the rulers and elders of that
church, who were &s;ome of them apo&s;tles;
to have acted, as occa&s;ions offered, in corre|&s;pondence,
and &s;ometimes in conjuntion
with them. Can it, after this, be doubted,
but that the religion and the general facts
relating to it, which St. Paul appears by his
letters to have delivered to the &s;everal
churches which he e&s;tabli&s;hed at a di&s;|tance,
were, at the &s;ame time, taught and
publi&s;hed at Jeru&s;alem it&s;elf, the place where
the bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted; and taught and
publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who had attended the
founder of the in&s;titution in his miraculous,
or pretendedly miraculous, mini&s;try?</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, for &s;o it appears both in
the epi&s;tles and from the Acts of the Apo&s;tles,
that Jeru&s;alem, and the &s;ociety of believers
in that city, long continued the centre from
which the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the religion i&s;&s;ued,
with which all other churches maintained a
corre&s;pondence and connection, to which
they referred their doubts, and to who&s;e re|lief,
<PB N="411" REF="415">
in times of public di&s;tre&s;s, they remitted
their charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This ob&s;ervation
I think material, becau&s;e it proves that this
was not the ca&s;e of giving out accounts in
one country of what is tran&s;acted in ano|ther,
without affording the hearers an oppor|tunity
of knowing whether the things re|lated
were credited by any, or even publi&s;h|ed,
in the place where they are reported to
have pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">V. St. Paul's letters furni&s;h evidence (and
what better evidence than a man's own let|ters
can be de&s;ired?) of the &s;oundne&s;s and
&s;obriety of his judgment. His caution in
di&s;tingui&s;hing between the occa&s;ional &s;ugge&s;|tions
of in&s;piration, and the ordinary exer|ci&s;e
of his natural under&s;tanding, is without
example in the hi&s;tory of human enthu|&s;ia&s;m.
His morality is every where calm,
pure, and rational; adapted to the condi|tion,
the activity, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ocial
life, and of its various relations; free from
the over-&s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s and au&s;terities of
&s;uper&s;tition, and from, what was more per|haps
to be apprehended, the ab&s;tractions of
quieti&s;m, and the &s;oarings or extravagancies
<PB N="412" REF="416">
of fanatici&s;m. His judgment concerning a
he&s;itating con&s;cience; his opinion of the
moral indifferency of many actions, yet of
the prudence and even the duty of compli|ance,
where non-compliance would produce
evil effects upon the minds of the per&s;ons
who ob&s;erved it, is as correct and ju&s;t as
the mo&s;t liberal and enlightened morali&s;t
could form at this day. The accuracy of
modern ethics has found nothing to amend
in the&s;e determinations.</P>
<P>What Lord Lyttelton has remarked of the
preference a&s;cribed by St. Paul to inward
rectitude of principle above every other re|ligious
accompli&s;hment, is very material, to
our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. "In his fir&s;t epi&s;tle
to the Corinthians, ch. xiii. ver. 1-3,
St. Paul has the&s;e words: <HI>Though I &s;peak
with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding
bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have
the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;|teries
and all knowledge, and though I have
all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And
though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor,</HI><PB N="413" REF="417">
<HI>and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</HI>
Is this the language of enthu&s;ia&s;m?
Did ever enthu&s;ia&s;t prefer that univer|&s;al
benevolence which comprehendeth
all moral virtues, and which, as appeareth
by the following ver&s;es, is meant by cha|rity
here; did ever enthu&s;ia&s;t, I &s;ay, pre|fer
that benevolence" (which we may add
is attainable by every man) "to faith and
to miracles, to tho&s;e religious opinions
which he had embraced, and to tho&s;e &s;u|pernatural
graces and gifts which he
imagined he had acquired; nay even to
the merit of martyrdom? Is it not the
genius of enthu&s;ia&s;m to &s;et moral virtues
infinitely below the merit of faith; and of
all moral virtues to value that lea&s;t which
is mo&s;t particularly enforced by St. Paul,
a &s;pirit of candour, moderation, and
peace? Certainly neither the temper nor
the opinions of a man &s;ubject to fanatic
delu&s;ions are to be found in this pa&s;&s;age."&mdash;Lord
Lyttelton's Con&s;iderations on the
Conver&s;ion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on therefore to que&s;tion the
<PB N="414" REF="418">
integrity of his under&s;tanding. To call him
a vi&s;ionary, becau&s;e he appealed to vi&s;ions;
or an enthu&s;ia&s;t, becau&s;e he pretended to
in&s;piration, is to take the whole que&s;tion for
granted. It is to take for granted that no
&s;uch vi&s;ions or in&s;pirations exi&s;ted; at lea&s;t
it is to a&s;&s;ume, contrary to his own a&s;&s;er|tions,
that he had no other proofs than the&s;e
to offer of his mi&s;&s;ion, or of the truth of his
relations.</P>
<P>One thing I allow, that his letters every
where di&s;cover great zeal and earne&s;tne&s;s in
the cau&s;e in which he was engaged; that is
to &s;ay, he was convinced of the truth of
what he taught; he was deeply impre&s;&s;ed,
but not more &s;o than the occa&s;ion merited,
with a &s;en&s;e of its importance. This pro|duces
a corre&s;ponding animation and &s;oli|citude
in the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try. But
would not the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;uppo&s;ing
them to be well founded, have holden the
&s;ame place, and produced the &s;ame effect, in

<P N="6">VI. The&s;e letters are deci&s;ive as to the
&s;ufferings of the author; al&s;o as to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
&s;tate of the Chri&s;tian church, and
<PB N="415" REF="419">
the dangers which attended the preaching
of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>"Whereof I Paul am made a mini&s;ter,
who now rejoice in my &s;ufferings for you,
and fill up that which is behind of the
afflictions of Chri&s;t in my fle&s;h, for his
body's &s;ake, which is the church."&mdash;Col.
ch. i. ver. 24.</P>
<P>"If in this life only we have hope in
Chri&s;t, we are of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable."
1 Cor. ch. xv. ver. 19.</P>
<P>"Why &s;tand we in jeopardy every hour?
I prote&s;t by your rejoicing, which I have
in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, I die daily. If, after the
manner of men, I have fought with bea&s;ts
at Ephe&s;us, what advantageth it me if the
dead ri&s;e not?" 1 Cor. ch. xv. ver. 30,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Chri&s;t: if &s;o be that we &s;uf|fer
with him, that we may be al&s;o glorified
together. For I reckon that the &s;ufferings of
this pre&s;ent time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that &s;hall be re|vealed
in us." Rom. ch. viii. ver. 17, 18.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="420">
"Who &s;hall &s;eparate us from the love of
Chri&s;t? &s;hall tribulation, or di&s;tre&s;s, or
per&s;ecution, or famine, or nakedne&s;s, or
peril, or &s;word? As it is written, For thy
&s;ake we are killed all the day long; we are
accounted as &s;heep for the &s;laughter."
Rom. chap. viii. ver. 35, 36.</P>
<P>"Rejoicing in hope, <HI>patient in tribulation,</HI>
continuing in&s;tant in prayer." Rom. chap.
xii. ver. 12.</P>
<P>"Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord; yet I give
my judgment as one that hath obtained
mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I &s;up|po&s;e
therefore that this is good <HI>for the
pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s</HI>; I &s;ay, that it is good for a
man &s;o to be." 1 Cor. ch. vii. ver. 25, 26.</P>
<P>"For unto you it is given, in the behalf
of Chri&s;t, not only to believe in him, but
al&s;o to &s;uffer for his &s;ake, having the &s;ame
conflict which ye &s;aw in me, and now
hear to be in me." Phil. ch. i. ver. 29, 30.</P>
<P>"God forbid that I &s;hould glory, &s;ave in
the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by
whom the world is crucified unto me, and
I unto the world."</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="421">
"From henceforth let no man trouble
me, for I bear in my body the marks of
the Lord Je&s;us." Gal. ch. vi. ver. 14. 17.</P>
<P>"Ye became followers of us, and of the
Lord, having received the word in much
affliction, with joy of the Holy Gho&s;t."
1 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver. 6.</P>
<P>"We our&s;elves glory in you in the
churches of God for your patience and
faith in all your per&s;ecutions and tribula|tions
that ye endure." 2 The&s;. ch. i. ver. 4.</P>
<P>We may &s;eem to have accumulated texts
unnece&s;&s;arily; but be&s;ide that the point,
which they are brought to prove, is of great
importance, there is this al&s;o to be remarked
in every one of the pa&s;&s;ages cited, that the
allu&s;ion is drawn from the writer by the
argument or the occa&s;ion; that the notice
which is taken of his &s;ufferings, and of the
&s;uffering condition of Chri&s;tianity, is per|fectly
incidental, and is dictated by no de|&s;ign
of &s;tating the facts them&s;elves. Indeed
they are not &s;tated at all: they may rather
be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;umed. This is a di&s;tinction
upon which we have relied a good deal in
former parts of this treati&s;e; and where the
<PB N="418" REF="422">
writer's information cannot be doubted, it
always, in my opinion, adds greatly to the
value and credit of the te&s;timony.</P>
<P>If any reader require from the apo&s;tle
more direct and explicit a&s;&s;ertions of the
&s;ame thing, he will receive full &s;atisfaction
in the following quotations.</P>
<P>"Are they mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t? (I &s;peak
as a fool) I am more; in labours more
abundant, in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri|&s;ons
more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the
Jews five times received I forty &s;tripes
&s;ave one; thrice was I beaten with rods,
once was I &s;toned; thrice I &s;uffered &s;hip|wreck,
a night and a day I have been in
the deep; in journeyings often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in pe|rils
by mine own countrymen, in perils
by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderne&s;s, in perils in the
&s;ea, in perils among fal&s;e brethren; in
wearine&s;s and painfulne&s;s, in watchings
often, in hunger and thir&s;t, in fa&s;tings
often, in cold and nakedne&s;s." 2 Cor.
chap. xi. ver. 23-28.</P>
<P>Can it be nece&s;&s;ary to add more? "I think
<PB N="419" REF="423">
that God hath &s;et forth us the apo&s;tles
la&s;t, as it were appointed to death; for we
are made a &s;pectacle unto the world, and
to angels, and to men.&mdash;Even unto this
pre&s;ent hour we both hunger and thir&s;t,
and are naked, and are buffeted, and have
no certain dwelling-place, and labour,
working with our own hands: being re|viled,
we ble&s;s; being per&s;ecuted, we &s;uf|fer
it; being defamed, we entreat: we are
made as the filth of the earth, and are
the off-&s;couring of all things unto this
day." 1 Cor. chap. iv. ver. 9-13. I &s;ub|join
this pa&s;&s;age to the former, becau&s;e it
extends to the other apo&s;tles of Chri&s;tianity
much of that which St. Paul declared con|cerning
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the following quotations, the reference
to the author's &s;ufferings is accompanied
with a &s;pecification of time and place, and
with an appeal for the truth of what he
declares to the knowledge of the per&s;ons
whom he addre&s;&s;es: "Even after that we
had &s;uffered before, and were &s;hamefully
entreated, <HI>as ye know, at Philippi,</HI> we were
bold in our God to &s;peak unto you the
<PB N="420" REF="424">
go&s;pel of God with much contention."
1 The&s;&s;. chap. ii. ver. 2.</P>
<P>"But <HI>thou ha&s;t fully known</HI> my doctrine,
manner of life, purpo&s;e, faith, long-&s;uffer|ing,
per&s;ecutions, afflictions, which came
to me <HI>at Antioch, at Iconium, at Ly&s;tra</HI>;
what per&s;ecutions I endured: but out of
them all the Lord delivered me." 2 Tim.
chap. iii. ver. 10, 11.</P>
<P>I apprehend that to this point, as far as
the te&s;timony of St. Paul is credited, the evi|dence
from his letters is complete and full.
It appears under every form in which it
could appear, by occa&s;ional allu&s;ions and by
direct a&s;&s;ertions, by general declarations and
by &s;pecific examples.</P>
<P N="7">VII. St. Paul in the&s;e letters a&s;&s;erts, in po&s;i|tive
and unequivocal terms, his performance
of miracles &s;trictly and properly &s;o called.</P>
<P>"He therefore that mini&s;tereth to you
the &s;pirit, and worketh miracles (<GAP DESC="foreign">)
among you, doeth he it by the
works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?" Gal. chap. iii. ver. 5.</P>
<P>"For I will not dare to &s;peak of tho&s;e
things which Chri&s;t hath not wrought by

me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> "I will &s;peak of nothing but what Chri&s;t hath wrought by <HI>me</HI>;" or, as Grotius interprets it, "Chri&s;t hath wrought &s;o great things by me, that I will not dare to &s;ay what he hath not wrought."</NOTE>, to make the Gentiles obedient, by
word and deed, through mighty &s;igns and
wonders (<GAP DESC="foreign">),
by the power of the &s;pirit of God; &s;o that
from Jeru&s;alem and round about unto Il|lyricum
I have fully preached the go&s;pel
of Chri&s;t." Rom. chap. xv. ver. 18, 19.</P>
<P>"Truly the &s;igns of an apo&s;tle were
wrought among you in all patience, in
&s;igns and wonders and mighty deeds"
(<GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>To the&s;e may be added the following indirect allu|&s;ions, which, though, if they had &s;tood alone, <HI>i. e.</HI> without plainer texts in the &s;ame writings, they might have been accounted dubious; yet, when con&s;idered in conjunction with the pa&s;&s;ages already cited, can hardly receive any other interpretation than that which we give them.</P>
<P>"My &s;peech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power; that your faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of man, but of the power of God." 1 Cor. chap. ii. ver. 4, 5.</P>
<P>"The go&s;pel, whereof I was made a mini&s;ter, ac|cording to the gift of the grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his power." Eph. ch. iii. ver. 7.</P>
<P>"For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apo&s;tle&s;hip of the circumci&s;ion, the &s;ame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles." Gal. ch. ii. ver. 8.</P>
<P>"For our go&s;pel came not unto you in word only, but al&s;o in power, and in the Holy Gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance." 1 The&s;&s;. chap. i. ver. 5.</P></NOTE>). 2 Cor.
chap. xii. ver. 12.</P>
<P>The&s;e words, &s;igns, wonders, and mighty
deeds (<GAP DESC="foreign">), are
<PB N="422" REF="426">
the &s;pecific appropriate terms throughout
the New Te&s;tament, employed when public
&s;en&s;ible miracles are intended to be expre&s;&s;ed.
This will appear by con&s;ulting, among&s;t other
places, the texts referred to in the note<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark, xvi. 20. Luke, xxiii. 8. John, ii. 11, 23; iii. 2; iv. 48, 54; xi. 49. Acts, ii. 22; iv. 30; v. 12; vi. 8; vii. 16; xiv. 3; xv. 12. Heb. ii. 4.</NOTE>;
and it cannot be &s;hown that they are ever
employed to expre&s;s any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, the&s;e words not only denote
miracles as oppo&s;ed to natural effects, but
they denote vi&s;ible, and what may be called
external, miracles, as di&s;tingui&s;hed,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, from <HI>in&s;piration.</HI> If St. Paul had
meant to refer only to &s;ecret illuminations
of his under&s;tanding, or &s;ecret influences
<PB N="423" REF="427">
upon his will or affections, he could not,
with truth, have repre&s;ented them as "&s;igns
and wonders <HI>wrought</HI> by him," of "&s;igns
and wonders and mighty deeds wrought
<HI>among&s;t</HI> them."</P>
<P>Secondly, from <HI>vi&s;ions.</HI> The&s;e would
not, by any means, &s;atisfy the force of the
terms, "&s;igns, wonders, and mighty deeds;"
&s;till le&s;s could they be &s;aid to be "<HI>wrought</HI>
by him," or "wrought <HI>among&s;t</HI> them:"
nor are the&s;e terms and expre&s;&s;ions any
where applied to vi&s;ions. When our author
alludes to the &s;upernatural communications
which he had received, either by vi&s;ion or
otherwi&s;e, he u&s;es expre&s;&s;ions &s;uited to the
nature of the &s;ubject, but very different
from the words which we have quoted. He
calls them revelations, but never &s;igns,
wonders, or mighty deeds. "I will come,"
&s;ays he, "to vi&s;ions and <HI>revelations</HI> of the
Lord;" and then proceeds to de&s;cribe a
particular in&s;tance, and afterwards adds,
"le&s;t I &s;hould be exalted above mea&s;ure
through the abundance of the revelations,
there was given me a thorn in the fle&s;h."</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the matter admits of no
<PB N="424" REF="428">
&s;oftening qualification, or ambiguity what|ever.
If St. Paul did not work actual, &s;en|&s;ible,
public miracles, he has knowingly, in
the&s;e letters, born his te&s;timony to a fal&s;e|hood.
I need not add, that, in two al&s;o
of the quotations, he has advanced his a&s;&s;er|tion
in the face of tho&s;e per&s;ons among&s;t
whom he declares the miracles to have been
wrought.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered that the Acts of the
Apo&s;tles de&s;cribe various particular miracles
wrought by St. Paul, which in their nature
an&s;wer to the terms and expre&s;&s;ions which
we have &s;een to be u&s;ed by St. Paul him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here then we have a man of liberal at|tainments,
and in other points of &s;ound
judgment, who had addicted his life to the
&s;ervice of the go&s;pel. We &s;ee him, in the
pro&s;ecution of his purpo&s;e, travelling from
country to country, enduring every &s;pecies
of hard&s;hip, encountering every extremity
of danger, a&s;&s;aulted by the populace, pu|ni&s;hed
by the magi&s;trates, &s;courged, beat,
&s;toned, left for dead; expecting, whenever
<PB N="425" REF="429">
he came, a renewal of the &s;ame treatment,
and the &s;ame dangers, yet, when driven
from one city, preaching in the next; &s;pend|ing
his whole time in the employment, &s;a|crificing
to it his plea&s;ures, his ea&s;e, his
&s;afety; per&s;i&s;ting in this cour&s;e to old age,
unaltered by the experience of perver&s;ene&s;s,
ingratitude, prejudice, de&s;ertion; un&s;ubdued
by anxiety, want, labour, per&s;ecutions; un|wearied
by long confinement, undi&s;mayed
by the pro&s;pect of death. Such was St.
Paul. We have his letters in our hands:
we have al&s;o a hi&s;tory purporting to be writ|ten
by one of his fellow-travellers, and ap|pearing,
by a compari&s;on with the&s;e letters,
certainly to have been written by &s;ome per|&s;on
well acquainted with the tran&s;actions of
his life. From the letters, as well as from
the hi&s;tory, we gather not only the account
which we have &s;tated of <HI>him,</HI> but that he
was one out of many who acted and &s;uf|fered
in the &s;ame manner; and that, of
tho&s;e who did &s;o, &s;everal had been the com|panions
of Chri&s;t's mini&s;try, the ocular wit|ne&s;&s;es,
or pretending to be &s;uch, of his mi|racles,
and of his re&s;urrection. We more|over
<PB N="426" REF="430">
find this &s;ame per&s;on referring in his
letters to his &s;upernatural conver&s;ion, the
particulars and accompanying circum&s;tances
of which are related in the hi&s;tory, and
which accompanying circum&s;tances, if all or
any of them be true, render it impo&s;&s;ible to
have been a delu&s;ion. We al&s;o find him po|&s;itively,
and in appropriated terms, a&s;&s;erting,
that he him&s;elf worked miracles, &s;trictly and
properly &s;o called, in &s;upport of the mi&s;&s;ion
which he executed; the hi&s;tory, meanwhile,
recording various pa&s;&s;ages of his mini&s;try,
which come up to the extent of this a&s;&s;er|tion.
The que&s;tion is, whether fal&s;ehood was
ever atte&s;ted by evidence like this. Fal&s;e|hoods,
we know, have found their way into
reports, into tradition, into books: but is an
example to be met with, of a man volun|tarily
undertaking a life of want and pain,
of ince&s;&s;ant fatigue, of continual peril; &s;ub|mitting
to the lo&s;s of his home and country,
to &s;tripes and &s;toning, to tedious impri&s;on|ment,
and the con&s;tant expectation of a
violent death, for the &s;ake of carrying about
a &s;tory of what was fal&s;e, and of what, if
fal&s;e, he mu&s;t have known to be &s;o?</P>
