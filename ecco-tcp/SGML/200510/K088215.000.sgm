<HEAD>A
DEFENCE
OF
FREE-THINKING
IN
MATHEMATICS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. _WHEN I read your Defence of
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mathematicians,
I could not, Sir, but admire
your Courage in a&s;&s;erting with
&s;uch undoubting A&s;&s;urance
things &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;proved. This to me
&s;eemed unaccountable, till I reflected on
what you &s;ay (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) when upon my having
appealed to every thinking Reader, whe|ther
it be po&s;&s;ible to frame any clear Con|ception
of Fluxions, you expre&s;s your&s;elf
in the following manner, "Pray, Sir,
who are tho&s;e thinking Readers you ap|peal
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to? Are they Geometricians, or
Per&s;ons wholly ignorant of Geometry?
If the former, I leave it to them: If the
latter, I ask how well are they qualified
to judge of the Method of Fluxions"?
It mu&s;t be acknowledged you &s;eem by this
Dilemma &s;ecure in the favour of one Part
of your Readers, and the ignorance of the
other. I am neverthele&s;s per&s;uaded there
are fair and candid Men among the Ma|thematicians.
And for tho&s;e who are not
Mathematicians, I &s;hall endeavour &s;o to
unveil this My&s;tery, and put the Contro|ver&s;y
between us in &s;uch a Light, as
that every Reader of ordinary Sen&s;e and
Reflection may be a competent Judge
thereof.</P>
<P N="2">II. "YOU expre&s;s an extreme Surprize
and Concern, that I &s;hould take &s;o
much Pains to depreciate one of the no|ble&s;t
Sciences, to di&s;parage and traduce
a Set of learned Men, who&s;e Labours
&s;o greatly conduce to the Honour of
this I&s;land, (<HI>p.</HI> 5.) to le&s;&s;en the Repu|tation
and Authority of Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>
and his Followers, by &s;hewing that
they are not &s;uch Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on as
they are generally pre&s;umed to be; and
to depreciate the Science they profe&s;s,
by demon&s;trating to the World, that it
<PB N="5" REF="4">
is not of the Clearne&s;s and Certainty as
is commonly imagined. All which, you
in&s;i&s;t, appears very &s;trange to you and
the re&s;t of that famous Univer&s;ity, who
plainly &s;ee of how great U&s;e Mathema|tical
Learning is to Mankind." Hence
you take occa&s;ion to declaim on the
U&s;efulne&s;s of Mathematics in the &s;everal
Branches, and then to redouble your Sur|prize
and Amazement (<HI>p.</HI> 19. and 20.). To
all which Declamation I reply, that it is
quite be&s;ide the Purpo&s;e. For I allow,
and always have allowed, its full claim of
Merit to whatever is u&s;eful and true in
the Mathematics: But that which is not
&s;o, the le&s;s it employs Men's time and
thoughts, the better. And after all you
have &s;aid or can &s;ay, I believe the unpreju|diced
Reader will think with me, that things
ob&s;cure are not therefore &s;acred; and that
it is no more a Crime to canva&s;s and de|tect
un&s;ound Principles or fal&s;e Rea&s;onings
in Mathematics, than in any other Part
of Learning.</P>
<P N="3">III. YOU are, it &s;eems, much at a lo&s;s
to under&s;tand the U&s;efulne&s;s or Tendency
or Prudence of my Attempt. I thought I
had &s;ufficiently explained this in the <HI>Ana|ly&s;t.</HI>
But for your further Satisfaction &s;hall
here tell you, it is very well known, that
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;everal Per&s;ons who deride Faith and My&s;|teries
in Religion, admit the Doctrine of
Fluxions for true and certain. Now if it be
&s;hewn that Fluxions are really mo&s;t incom|prehen&s;ible
My&s;teries, and that tho&s;e, who
believe them to be clear and &s;cientific, do
entertain an implicite Faith in the Author
of that Method; will not this furni&s;h a fair
<HI>Argumentum ad Hominem</HI> again&s;t Men, who
reject that very thing in Religion which they
admit in human Learning? And is it not a
proper Way to abate the Pride, and di&s;credit
the Preten&s;ions of tho&s;e, who in&s;i&s;t upon
clear Ideas in Points of Faith, if it be &s;hewn
that they do without them even in
Science?</P>
<P N="4">IV. AS to my timeing this Charge; why
now and not before, &s;ince I had publi&s;hed
Hints thereof many Years ago? Surely I
am obliged to give no Account of this: If
what hath been &s;aid in the Analy&s;t be not
&s;ufficient; &s;uppo&s;e that I had not Lei&s;ure,
or that I did not think it expedient, or that
I had no Mind to it. When a Man thinks
fit to publi&s;h any Thing, either in Mathe|matics,
or in any other Part of Learning;
what avails it, or indeed what Right hath
any one to ask, why at this or that Time;
in this or that Manner; upon this or that
Motive? Let the Reader judge, if it &s;uffice
<PB N="7" REF="6">
not, that what I publi&s;h is true, and that I
have a Right to publi&s;h &s;uch Truths, when
and how I plea&s;e, in a free Country.</P>
<P N="5">V. I DO not &s;ay, that Mathematicians,
as &s;uch, are Infidels; or that Geometry is
a Friend to Infidelity; which you untruly
in&s;inuate, as you do many other Things;
whence you rai&s;e Topics for invective: But
I &s;ay there are certain Mathematicians, who
are known to be &s;o; and that there are o|thers,
who are not Mathematicians, who
are influenced by a Regard for their Au|thority.
Some, perhaps, who live in the
Univer&s;ity, may not be appri&s;ed of this;
but the intelligent and ob&s;erving Reader,
who lives in the World, and is acquainted
with the Humour of the Times, and the
Characters of Men, is well aware, there
are too many that deride My&s;teries, and
yet admire Fluxions; who yield that Faith
to a mere Mortal, which they deny to
<HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Religion they make it
their Study and Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;credit. The
owning this is not to own, that Men who
rea&s;on well, are Enemies to Religion, as you
would repre&s;ent it: On the contrary, I en|deavour
to &s;hew, that &s;uch Men are defec|tive
in Point of Rea&s;on and Judgment, and
that they do the very Thing they would
&s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="8" REF="7">
VI. THERE are, I make no doubt,
among the Mathematicians many &s;incere
Believers in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; I know &s;everal
&s;uch my &s;elf; but I addre&s;&s;ed my Analy&s;t
to an Infidel; and on very good Grounds,
I &s;uppo&s;ed that be&s;ides him, there were
other Deriders of Faith, who had never|thele&s;s
a profound Veneration for Fluxions;
and I was willing to &s;et forth the Incon|&s;i&s;tence
of &s;uch Men. If there be no &s;uch
Thing as Infidels, who pretend to Knowledge
in the modern Analy&s;is, I own my &s;elf mi&s;in|formed,
and &s;hall gladly be found in a Mi&s;|take;
but even in that Ca&s;e, my Remarks
upon Fluxions are not the le&s;s true; nor
will it follow, that I have no Right to exa|mine
them on the Foot of humane Science,
even though Religion were quite uncon|cerned,
and though I had no End to &s;erve
but Truth. But you are very angry (<HI>P.</HI> 13
<HI>and</HI> 14.) that I &s;hould enter the Li&s;ts with
rea&s;oning Infidels, and attack them upon
their Preten&s;ions to Science: And hence
you take Occa&s;ion to &s;hew your Spleen a|gain&s;t
the Clergy. I will not take upon me
to &s;ay, that I know you to be a Minute
Philo&s;opher your &s;elf: But I know, the
Minute Philo&s;ophers make ju&s;t &s;uch Com|pliments
as you do to our Church, and are
ju&s;t as angry, as you can be, at any who un|dertake
to defend Religion by Rea&s;on. If
<PB N="9" REF="8">
we re&s;olve all into Faith, they laugh at us
and our Faith: And if we attempt to Rea|&s;on,
they are angry at us: They pretend
we go out of our Province, and they re|commend
to us a blind implicite Faith.
Such is the Incon&s;i&s;tence of our Adver&s;aries.
But it is to be hoped, there will never be
wanting Men to deal with them at their
own Weapons; and to &s;hew, they are by
no Means tho&s;e Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on, which
they would fain pa&s;s for.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I DO not &s;ay, as you would repre|&s;ent
me, that we have no better Rea&s;on for
our Religion, than you have for Fluxions:
But I &s;ay, that an Infidel, who believes the
Doctrine of Fluxions, acts a very incon|&s;i&s;tent
Part, in pretending to reject the
Chri&s;tian Religion, becau&s;e he cannot be|lieve
what he doth not comprehend; or be|cau&s;e
he cannot a&s;&s;ent without Evidence;
or becau&s;e he cannot &s;ubmit his Faith to
Authority. Whether there are &s;uch Infidels,
I &s;ubmit to the Judgment of the Reader.
For my own Part I make no Doubt of it,
having &s;een &s;ome &s;hrewd Signs thereof my
&s;elf, and having been very credibly informed
thereof by others. Nor doth this Charge
&s;eem the le&s;s credible, for your being &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly
touched, and denying it with &s;o much
Pa&s;&s;ion. You, indeed, do not &s;tick to affirm,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
that the per&s;ons, who informed me are <HI>a
pack of ba&s;e, profligate, and impudent liars,</HI>
(<HI>P.</HI> 27.) How far the Reader will think fit
to adopt your pa&s;&s;ions, I cannot &s;ay; but I
can truly &s;ay, the late celebrated Mr <HI>Ad|di&s;on</HI>
is one of the per&s;ons, whom you are
plea&s;ed to characterize in tho&s;e mode&s;t and
mannerly terms. He a&s;&s;ured me that the In|fidelity
of a certain noted Mathematician,
&s;till living, was one principal rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign|ed
by a witty man of tho&s;e times for his
being an Infidel. Not, that I imagine Geo|metry
di&s;po&s;eth Men to Infidelity; but that
from other cau&s;es, &s;uch as Pre&s;umption, Ig+norance,
or Vanity, like other Men, Geo|metricians
al&s;o become Infidels, and that
the &s;uppo&s;ed light and evidence of their
Science gains credit to their Infidelity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. "YOU reproach me with Ca|lumny,
detraction and artifice (<HI>P.</HI> 15.)
You recommend &s;uch means as are in|nocent
and ju&s;t, rather than the crimi|nal
method of le&s;&s;ening or detracting
from my opponents (<HI>ibid.</HI>) You accu&s;e
me of the <HI>Odium Theologicum,</HI> the in|temperate
Zeal of Divines, that I do
<HI>&s;tare &s;uper vias antiquas,</HI>" (<HI>P.</HI> 13.) with
much more to the &s;ame effect. For all
which charge I depend on the reader's
candour, that he will not take your word,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
but read and judge for him&s;elf. In which
ca&s;e he will be able to di&s;cern (though he
&s;hould be no Mathematician) how pa&s;&s;io|nate
and unju&s;t your reproaches are, and
how po&s;&s;ible it is for a Man to cry out
again&s;t Calumny and practi&s;e it in the
&s;ame breath. Con&s;idering how impatient
all Mankind are when their prejudices are
looked into, I do not wonder to &s;ee you
rail and rage at the rate you do. But if
your own Imagination be &s;trongly &s;hocked
and moved, you cannot therefore conclude,
that a &s;incere endeavour to free a &s;cience,
&s;o u&s;eful and ornamental to Humane Life,
from tho&s;e &s;ubtilties, ob&s;curities, and para|doxes,
which render it inacce&s;&s;ible to mo&s;t
Men, will be thought a criminal under|taking
by &s;uch as are in their right Mind.
Much le&s;s can you hope that an illu&s;trious
&s;eminary of Learned Men, which hath
produced &s;o many free-&s;pirited inquirers af|ter
Truth, will at once enter into your pa&s;|&s;ions,
and degenerate into a ne&s;t of Bigots.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I OBSERVE upon the Incon|&s;i&s;tency
of certain Infidel Analy&s;ts. I re|mark
&s;ome defects in the principles of the
modern Analy&s;is. I take the liberty de|cently
to di&s;&s;ent from Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> I
propo&s;e &s;ome helps to abridge the trouble
of Mathematical Studies, and render them
<PB N="12" REF="11">
more u&s;eful. What is there in all this,
that &s;hould make you declaim on the u&s;e|fulne&s;s
of practical Mathematics? that
&s;hould move you to cry out <HI>Spain, Inqui|&s;ition,
Odium Theologicum</HI>? By what figure
of Speech, do you extend, what is &s;aid of
the modern Analy&s;is, to Mathematics in
general, or what is &s;aid of Mathematical
Infidels to all Mathematicians, or the con|futing
an errour in Science to burning or
hanging the Authors? But it is nothing
new or &s;trange, that Men &s;hould choo&s;e to
indulge their pa&s;&s;ions, rather than quit
their opinions how ab&s;urd &s;oever. Hence
the frightful vi&s;ions and tragical uproars of
Bigotted Men, be the Subject of their Bi|gotry
what it will. A very remarkable in|&s;tance
of this you give (<HI>P.</HI> 27.) where,
upon my having &s;aid that a deference to
certain Mathematical Infidels, as I was
credibly informed, had been one motive to
Infidelity, you ask with no &s;mall emotion,
"For God's &s;ake are we in <HI>England</HI> or in
<HI>Spain</HI>? Is this the language of a Fami|liar
who is whi&s;pering an Inqui&s;itor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"
And, the page before, you exclaim in the
following Words; "Let us burn or hang
up all the Mathematicians in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> or halloo the mob upon them to
tear them to pieces every Mother's Son
of them, <HI>Tros Rutulu&s;ve fuat,</HI> Laymen
<PB N="13" REF="12">
or Clergymen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us dig up the
bodies of Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> and Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton,</HI> and burn them under the Gal|lows."</P>
<P N="10">X. THE Reader need not be a Ma|thematician,
to &s;ee how vain all this Tra|gedy
of yours is. And if he be as tho|roughly
&s;atisfied as I am, that the cau&s;e
of Fluxions cannot be defended by rea|&s;on,
he will be as little &s;urpri&s;ed as I am,
to &s;ee you betake your &s;elf to the arts of
all bigotted men, rai&s;ing terror, and cal|ling
in the pa&s;&s;ions to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
Whether tho&s;e Rhetorical flouri&s;hes about
the Inqui&s;ition and the Gallows are not
quite ridiculous, I leave to be determined
by the Reader. Who will al&s;o judge
(though he &s;hould not be skilled in Geo|metry)
whether I have given the lea&s;t
grounds for this and a World of &s;uch
like declamation? and whether I have not
con&s;tantly treated tho&s;e celebrated Wri|ters,
with all proper re&s;pect, though I
take the liberty in certain points to differ
from them?</P>
<P N="11">XI. AS I heartily abhor an Inqui&s;ition
in Faith, &s;o I think you have no right to
erect one in Science. At the time of wri|ting
your defence, you &s;eem to have been
<PB N="14" REF="13">
overcome with Pa&s;&s;ion: But now you
may be &s;uppo&s;ed cool, I de&s;ire you to re|flect
whether it be not wrote in the true
&s;pirit of an Inqui&s;itor? Whether this be|comes
a Per&s;on &s;o exceeding delicate him|&s;elf
upon that Point? And whether your
Brethren the <HI>Analy&s;ts</HI> will think them|&s;elves
honoured or obliged by you, for
having defended their Doctrine, in the
&s;ame manner as any declaiming Bigot
would defend Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation? The
&s;ame fal&s;e colours, the &s;ame intemperate
Sallies, and the &s;ame Indignation again&s;t
common Sen&s;e!</P>
<P N="12">XII. IN a matter of mere Science,
where authority hath nothing to do, you
con&s;tantly endeavour to overbear me with
authorities, and load me with envy. If I
&s;ee a Sophi&s;m in the writings of a great
Author, and, in compliment to his un|der&s;tanding,
&s;u&s;pect he could hardly be
quite &s;atisfy'd with his own demon&s;tra|tion:
This &s;ets you on declaiming for
&s;everal pages. It is pompou&s;ly &s;et forth,
as a criminal method of detracting from
great men, as a concerted project to le&s;&s;en
their reputation, as making them pa&s;s for
impo&s;tors. If I publi&s;h my free thoughts,
which I have as much right to publi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> any other man, it is imputed to ra&s;h|ne&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and vanity and the love of oppo&s;ition.
Though perhaps my late publication, of
what had been hinted twenty five years
ago, may acquit me of this charge in the
eyes of an impartial Reader. But when I
con&s;ider the perplexities that be&s;et a man,
who undertakes to defend the doctrine
of Fluxions, I can ea&s;ily forgive your
anger.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. TWO &s;orts of learned men there
are; one, who candidly &s;eek Truth by
rational means. The&s;e are never aver&s;e
to have their principles looked into, and
examined by the te&s;t of Rea&s;on. Ano|ther
&s;ort there is, who learn by <HI>route</HI> a
&s;et of principles and a way of thinking
which happen to be in vogue. The&s;e
betray them&s;elves by their anger and &s;ur|pri&s;e,
whenever their principles are freely
canva&s;&s;ed. But you mu&s;t not expect, that
your Reader will make him&s;elf a party to
your pa&s;&s;ions or your prejudices. I freely
own that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> hath &s;hew'd
him&s;elf an extraordinary Mathematician,
a profound Naturali&s;t, a Per&s;on of the
greate&s;t Abilities and Erudition. Thus far
I can readily go, but I cannot go the
lengths that you do. I &s;hall never &s;ay of
him as you do, <HI>Ve&s;tigia pronus adoro,</HI>
(<HI>p.</HI> 70.) This &s;ame adoration that you pay
to him, I will pay only to Truth.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="16" REF="15">
XIV. YOU may, indeed, your &s;elf be
an Idolater of whom you plea&s;e: But
then you have no right to in&s;ult and ex|claim
at other men, becau&s;e they do not
adore your Idol. Great as Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>
was, I think he hath, on more occa|&s;ions
than one, &s;hew'd him&s;elf not to be
infallible. Particularly, his demon&s;tration
of the Doctrine of Fluxions I take to be
defective, and I cannot help thinking that
he was not quite plea&s;ed with it him&s;elf.
And yet this doth not hinder but the me|thod
may be u&s;eful, con&s;idered as an art
of Invention. You, who are a Mathema|tician,
mu&s;t acknowledge, there have been
divers &s;uch methods admitted in Mathe|matics,
which are not demon&s;trative. Such,
for in&s;tance, are the Inductions of Doctor
<HI>Wallis</HI> in his Arithmetic of Infinites, and
&s;uch, what <HI>Harriot</HI> and, after him, <HI>De&s;|cartes</HI>
have wrote concerning the roots of
affected Aequations. It will not, neverthe|le&s;s,
thence follow that tho&s;e methods are
u&s;ele&s;s; but only, that they are not to
be allowed of as Premi&s;&s;es in a &s;trict
Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P N="15">XV. NO great Name upon earth &s;hall
ever make me accept things ob&s;cure for
clear, or Sophi&s;ms for Demon&s;trations.
Nor may you ever hope to deter me from
freely &s;peaking what I freely think, by
<PB N="17" REF="16">
tho&s;e arguments <HI>ab invidia</HI> which at every
turn you employ again&s;t me. You re|pre&s;ent
your &s;elf (<HI>P.</HI> 52.) as a man, <HI>who&s;e
highe&s;t Ambition is in the lowe&s;t degree to
imitate Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton. It might, per|haps,
have &s;uited better with your appel|lation
of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> and been altogether
as laudable, if your highe&s;t ambition had
been to di&s;cover Truth. Very con&s;i&s;tently
with the character you give of your &s;elf,
you &s;peak of it as a &s;ort of crime (<HI>P.</HI> 70.)
to think it po&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould ever <HI>&s;ee
further, or go beyond Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton.
And I am per&s;uaded you &s;peak the Senti|ments
of many more be&s;ides your &s;elf.
But there are others who are not afraid to
&s;ift the Principles of human Science, who
think it no honour to imitate the greate&s;t
man in his Defects, who even think it no
crime to de&s;ire to know, not only beyond
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> but beyond all Mankind.
And whoever thinks otherwi&s;e, I appeal
to the Reader, whether he can properly be
called a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. BECAUSE I am not guilty
of your mean Idolatry, you inveigh again&s;t
me as a per&s;on conceited of my own Abi|lities;
not con&s;idering that a per&s;on of le&s;s
Abilities may know more on a certain
point than one of greater; not con&s;ider|ing
that a purblind eye, in a clo&s;e and
<PB N="18" REF="17">
narrow view, may di&s;cern more of a thing,
than a much better eye in a more exten|&s;ive
pro&s;pect; not con&s;idering that this is
to fix a <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> to put a &s;top to all
future inquiries; La&s;tly, not con&s;idering
that this is in fact, &s;o much as in you lies,
converting the Republick of Letters into
an ab&s;olute Monarchy, that it is even in|troducing
a kind of Philo&s;ophic Popery
among a free People.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. I HAVE &s;aid (and I venture &s;till
to &s;ay) that a Fluxion is incomprehen&s;ible:
That &s;econd, third, and fourth Fluxions are
yet more incomprehen&s;ible: That it is not
po&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;imple Infinite&s;imal,

What have you to &s;ay in an&s;wer to
this? Do you attempt to clear up the noti|on
of a Fluxion or a Difference? Nothing
like it; "you only a&s;&s;ure me (upon your
bare word) from your own experience, and
that of &s;everal others whom you could
name, that the Doctrine of Fluxions
may be clearly conceived and di&s;tinctly
comprehended; and that if I am puz|zled
about it and do not under&s;tand it,
yet others do". But can you think, Sir,
I &s;hall take your word when I refu&s;e to
take your Ma&s;ter's?</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="19" REF="18">
XVIII. UPON this point every Rea|der
of common &s;en&s;e may judge as well as
the mo&s;t profound Mathematician. The
&s;imple apprehen&s;ion of a thing defined is
not made more perfect by any &s;ub&s;equent
progre&s;s in Mathematics. What any man
evidently knows, he knows as well as you
or Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> And every one can
know whether the object of this method
be (as you would have us think) clearly
conceivable. To judge of this, no depth
of Science is requi&s;ite, but only a bare at|tention
to what pa&s;&s;es in his own mind.
And the &s;ame is to be under&s;tood of all
definitions in all Sciences what&s;oever. In
none of which can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
a man of Sen&s;e and Spirit will take any
definition or principle upon tru&s;t, with|out
&s;ifting it to the bottom, and trying
how far he can or he cannot conceive it.
This is the cour&s;e I have taken and &s;hall
take, however you and your Brethren may
declaim again&s;t it, and place it in the mo&s;t
invidious Light.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. IT is u&s;ual with you to admo|ni&s;h
me to look over a &s;econd time, to
con&s;ult, examine, weigh the words of Sir
<HI>I&s;aac.</HI> In an&s;wer to which I will ven|ture
to &s;ay, that I have taken as much
pains as (I &s;incerely believe) any man
<PB N="20" REF="19">
living, to under&s;tand that great Author,
and to make &s;en&s;e of his principles. No
indu&s;try nor caution nor attention, I a&s;&s;ure
you, have been wanting on my part. So
that, if I do not under&s;tand him, it is not
my fault but my misfortune. Upon other
&s;ubjects you are plea&s;ed to compliment me
with depth of thought and uncommon
abilities, (<HI>P.</HI> 5. and 84.) But I freely own,
I have no pretence to tho&s;e things. The
only advantage I pretend to, is that I have
always thought and judged for my &s;elf.
And, as I never had a ma&s;ter in Mathe|matics,
&s;o I fairly followed the dictates of
my own mind in examining, and cen&s;u|ring
the authors I read upon that &s;ubject,
with the &s;ame freedom that I u&s;ed upon
any other; taking nothing upon tru&s;t, and
believing that no writer was infallible.
And a man of moderate parts, who takes
this painful cour&s;e in &s;tudying the prin|ciples
of any Science, may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to walk more &s;urely than tho&s;e of greater
abilities, who &s;et out with more &s;peed and
le&s;s care.</P>
<P N="20">XX. WHAT I in&s;i&s;t on is, that the
idea of a Fluxion, &s;imply con&s;idered, is
not at all improved or amended by any
progre&s;s, though ever &s;o great, in the Ana|ly&s;is:
neither are the demon&s;trations of the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
general rules of that method at all cleared
up by applying them. The rea&s;on of
which is, becau&s;e in operating or calculat|ing,
men do not return to contemplate the
original principles of the method, which
they con&s;tantly pre&s;uppo&s;e, but are em|ployed
in working, by notes and &s;ymbols,
denoting the Fluxions &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been at fir&s;t explained, and according to
rules &s;uppo&s;ed to have been at fir&s;t de|mon&s;trated.
This I &s;ay to encourage
tho&s;e, who are not far gone in the&s;e
Studies, to u&s;e intrepidly their own judg|ment,
without a blind or a mean de|ference
to the be&s;t of Mathematicians, who
are no more qualify'd than they are, to
judge of the &s;imple apprehen&s;ion, or the
evidence of what is delivered in the fir&s;t
elements of the method; men by further
and frequent u&s;e or exerci&s;e becoming only
more accu&s;tomed to the &s;ymbols and rules,
which doth not make either the foregoing
notions more clear, or the foregoing proofs
more perfect. Every Reader of common
&s;en&s;e, that will but u&s;e his faculties, knows
as well as the mo&s;t profound Analy&s;t what
idea he frames or can frame of Velocity
without motion, or of motion without ex|ten&s;ion,
of magnitude which is neither fi|nite
nor infinite, or of a quantity having
no magnitude which is yet divi&s;ible, of a
figure where there is no &s;pace, of proporti|on
<PB N="22" REF="21">
between nothings, or of a real product
from nothing multiplied by &s;omething. He
need not be far gone in Geometry to know,
that ob&s;cure principles are not to be ad|mitted
in Demon&s;tration: That if a man
de&s;troys his own Hypothe&s;is, he at the
&s;ame time de&s;troys what was built upon it:
That error in the premi&s;es, not rectified,
mu&s;t produce error in the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. IN my opinion the greate&s;t men
have their Prejudices. Men learn the ele|ments
of Science from others: And every
learner hath a deference more or le&s;s to
authority, e&s;pecially the young learners,
few of that kind caring to dwell long up|on
principles, but inclining rather to take
them upon tru&s;t: And things early admit|ted
by repetition become familiar: And
this familiarity at length pa&s;&s;eth for Evi|dence.
Now to me it &s;eems, there are
certain points tacitly admitted by Mathe|maticians,
which are neither evident nor
true. And &s;uch points or principles ever
mixing with their rea&s;oning do lead them
into paradoxes and perplexities. If the
great author of the fluxionary method was
early imbued with &s;uch notions, it would
only &s;hew he was a man. And if by vir|tue
of &s;ome latent error in his principles
a man be drawn into fallacious rea&s;onings,
it is nothing &s;trange that he &s;hould take
<PB N="23" REF="22">
them for true: And, neverthele&s;s, if; when
urged by perplexities and uncouth con&s;e|quences,
and driven to arts and &s;hifts, he
&s;hould entertain &s;ome doubt thereof, it is
no more than, one may naturally &s;uppo&s;e,
might befall a great genious grappling with
an in&s;uperable difficulty: Which is the
light in which I have placed Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> Sect. xviij</NOTE>.
Herereupon you are plea&s;ed to re|mark,
that I repre&s;ent the great author
not only as a weak but an ill man, as a
Deceiver and an Impo&s;tor. The Reader will
judge how ju&s;tly.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. AS to the re&s;t of your colourings
and glo&s;&s;es, your reproaches and in&s;ults
and outcries, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, on|ly
de&s;iring the Reader not to take your
word, but read what I have written, and
he will want no other an&s;wer. It hath
been often ob&s;erved that the wor&s;t cau&s;e
produceth the greate&s;t clamour, and in|deed
you are &s;o clamorous throughout
your defence that the Reader, although
he &s;hould be no Mathematician, provided
he under&s;tands common &s;en&s;e and hath
ob&s;erved the ways of men, will be apt to
&s;u&s;pect you are in the wrong. It &s;hould
&s;eem, therefore, that your Brethren the
Analy&s;ts are but little obliged to you, for
<PB N="24" REF="23">
this new method of declaiming in Mathe|matics.
Whether they are more obliged
by your Rea&s;oning I &s;hall now examine.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. YOU ask me (<HI>p.</HI> 32.) where I
find Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions
as the Velocities of Velocities, the &s;econd,
third, and fourth Velocities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This you
&s;et forth as a pious fraud and unfair repre|&s;entation.
I an&s;wer, that if according to
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> a Fluxion be the veloci|ty
of an increment, then according to him
I may call the Fluxion of a Fluxion the Ve|locity
of a Velocity. But for the truth of the
antecedent &s;ee his introduction to the Qua|drature
of Curves, where his own words are,
<HI>motuum velincrementorum velocitates nominan|do
Fluxiones.</HI> See al&s;o the &s;econd Lemma of
the &s;econd Book of his mathematical prin|ciples
of natural Philo&s;ophy, where he ex|pre&s;&s;eth
him&s;elf in the following manner,
<HI>velocitates incrementorum ac decrementorum,
quas etiam, motus, mutationes &amp; fluxiones
quantitatum nominare licet.</HI> And that he ad|mits
Fluxions of Fluxions, or &s;econd, third,
fourth Fluxions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ee his Treati&s;e of the
Quadrature of Curves. I ask now, Is it
not plain, that if a Fluxion be a Velocity,
then the Fluxion of a Fluxion may agreea|bly
thereunto be called the Velocity of a
Velocity? In like manner if by a Fluxion
<PB N="25" REF="24">
is meant a na&s;cent augment, will it not then
follow, that the Fluxion of a Fluxion, or
&s;econd Fluxion is the na&s;cent augment of
a na&s;cent augment? Can any thing be plain|er?
Let the Reader now judge who is unfair.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. I HAD ob&s;erved, that the Great
Author had proceeded illegitimately, in ob|taining
the Fluxion or moment of the Rec|tangle
of two flowing quantities; and that
he did not fairly get rid of the Rectangle of
the moments. In an&s;wer to this you al|ledge,
that the error ari&s;ing from the o|mi&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch rectangle (allowing it to be
an error) is &s;o &s;mall that it is in&s;ignificant.
This you dwell upon and examplify to no
other purpo&s;e, but to amu&s;e your Reader
and mi&s;lead him from the Que&s;tion; which
in truth is not concerning the accuracy of
computing or mea&s;uring in practice, but
concerning the accuracy of the rea&s;oning
in &s;cience. That this was really the ca&s;e,
and that the &s;mallne&s;s of the practical error
no wi&s;e concerns it, mu&s;t be &s;o plain to
any one who reads the Analy&s;t, that I won|der
how you could be ignorant of it.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. YOU would fain per&s;uade your
Reader, that I make an ab&s;urd quarrel a|gain&s;t
errors of no &s;ignificancy in practice,
and repre&s;ent Mathematicians as proceeding
<PB N="26" REF="25">
blindfold in their approximations; in all
which I cannot help thinking there is on
your part either great ignorance or great
di&s;ingenuity. If you mean to defend the
rea&s;onablene&s;s and u&s;e of approximations, or
of the method of Indivi&s;ibles, I have no|thing
to &s;ay. But then you mu&s;t remem|ber
this is not the Doctrine of Fluxions:
It is none of that Analy&s;is with which I
am concerned. That I am far from quar|relling
at approximations in Geometry is
manife&s;t from the thirty third and fifty
third Queries in the Analy&s;t. And that
the method of Fluxions pretends to &s;ome|what
more than the method of Indivi&s;ibles
is plain; becau&s;e Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> di&s;claims this
method as not Geometrical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Schelium at the end of the fir&s;t Section,</HI> Lib. 1. Phil. Nat. Princip. Math..</NOTE> And that
the method of Fluxions is &s;uppo&s;ed accu|rate
in Geometrical rigour is manife&s;t, to
whoever con&s;iders what the Great Author
writes about it; e&s;pecially in his Intro|duction
to the Quadrature of Curves, where
he &s;aith <HI>In rebus mathematicis errores quam
minimi non &s;unt contemnendi.</HI> Which ex|pre&s;&s;ion
you have &s;een quoted in the Ana|ly&s;t,
and yet you &s;eem ignorant thereof,
and indeed, of the very End and De&s;ign
of the Great Author in this his invention of
Fluxions.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="27" REF="26">
XXVI. AS oft as you talk of finite quan|tities
incon&s;iderable in practice, Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>
di&s;owns your apology. <HI>Cave,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>in|tellexeris
finitas.</HI> And although Quantities
le&s;s than &s;en&s;ible may be of no account in
practice, yet none of your ma&s;ters, nor will
even you your&s;elf venture to &s;ay, they are
of no account in Theory and in Rea&s;oning.
The application in gro&s;s practice is not the
point que&s;tioned, but the rigour and ju&s;t|ne&s;s
of the rea&s;oning. And it is evident
that, be the &s;ubject ever &s;o little, or ever
&s;o incon&s;iderable, this doth not hinder but
that a per&s;on treating thereof may com|mit
very great errors in Logic, which Lo|gical
errors are in no wi&s;e to be mea&s;ured
by the &s;en&s;ible or practical inconveniences
thence ari&s;ing, which, perchance, may be
none at all. It mu&s;t be owned, that after
you have mi&s;lead and amu&s;ed your le&s;s qua|lified
Reader (as you call him) you return
to the real point in controver&s;y, and &s;et
your &s;elf to ju&s;tifie Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s method of
getting rid of the abovementioned Rectan|gle.
And here I mu&s;t intreat the Reader to
ob&s;erve how fairly you proceed.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. FIRST then you affirm (<HI>P.</HI> 44.)
"that, neither in the Demon&s;tration of the
Rule for finding the Fluxion of the rec|tangle
of two flowing quantities, nor in
<PB N="28" REF="27">
any thing preceding or following it, is
any mention &s;o much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle of &s;uch
flowing quantities." Now I affirm the
direct contrary. For in the very pa&s;&s;age by
you quoted in this &s;ame page, from the fir&s;t
ca&s;e of the &s;econd lemma of the &s;econd
Book of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Principles, beginning
with <HI>Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo
auctum,</HI> and ending with <HI>igitur laterum in|crementis
totis a et b generatur rectanguli
incrementum a B</HI> x <HI>b A Q. E. D.</HI> In this
very pa&s;&s;age, I &s;ay, is expre&s;s mention made
of the increment of &s;uch rectangle. As this
is matter of fact, I refer it to the Reader's
own eyes. Of what rectangle have we here
the Increment? Is it not plainly of that
who&s;e &s;ides have <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for their <HI>Incre|menta
tota,</HI> that is, of <HI>AB</HI>? Let any Reader
judge whether it be not plain from the
words, the &s;en&s;e, and the context, that the
Great Author in the end of his demon&s;tra|tion
under&s;tands his <HI>incrementum</HI> as belong|ing
to the <HI>Rectangulum quodvis</HI> at the begin|ning.
Is not the &s;ame al&s;o evident from the
very Lemma it &s;elf prefixed to the Demon|&s;tration?
The &s;en&s;e whereof is (as the Au|thor
there explains it) that if the moments
of the flowing quantities <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> are cal|led
<HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> then the <HI>momentum vel mutatio
geniti rectanguli AB</HI> will be <HI>a B</HI> x <HI>b A.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Either therefore the conclu&s;ion of the de|mon&s;tration
is not the thing which was to
be demon&s;trated, or the <HI>rectanguli incremen|tum
a B</HI> x <HI>b A</HI> belongs to the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. ALL this is &s;o plain that no|thing
can be more &s;o; and yet you would
fain perplex this plain ca&s;e by di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
between an increment and a moment.
But it is evident to every one, who has any
notion of Demon&s;tration, that the <HI>incre|mentum</HI>
in the Conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be the <HI>mo|mentum</HI>
in the Lemma; and to &s;uppo&s;e it
otherwi&s;e is no credit to the Author. It is
in effect &s;uppo&s;ing him to be one who did
not know what he would demon&s;trate. But
let us hear Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s own words: <HI>Earum
(quantitatum &s;cilicet fluentium) incrementa
vel decrementa momentanea &s;ub nomine mo|mentorum
intelligo.</HI> And you ob&s;erve your
&s;elf that he u&s;eth the word <HI>moment</HI> to &s;ig|nify
either an increment or decrement.
Hence, with an intention to puzzle me, you
propo&s;e the increment and decrement of
<HI>AB,</HI> and ask which of the&s;e I would call the
moment? The ca&s;e, you &s;ay, is difficult. My
an&s;wer is very plain and ea&s;y, to wit, Either
of them. You, indeed, make a different
an&s;wer, and from the Author's &s;aying that,
by a moment he under&s;tands either the mo|mentaneous
increment or decrement of the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
flowing quantities, you would have us con|clude,
by a very wonderful inference, that
his moment is neither the increment nor
decrement thereof. Would it not be as good
an inference, Becau&s;e a number is either
odd or even, to conclude it is neither? Can
any one make &s;en&s;e of this? Or can even
your &s;elf hope that this will go down with
the Reader, how little &s;oever qualified? It
mu&s;t be owned, you endeavour to obtrude
this inference on him, rather by mirth and
humour than by rea&s;oning. You are merry,
I &s;ay, and (<HI>P.</HI> 46.) repre&s;ent the two ma|thematical
quantities as pleading their
rights, as to&s;&s;ing up cro&s;s and pile, as di&s;|puting
amicably. You talk of their claim|ing
preference, their agreeing, their boy|i&s;hne&s;s
and their gravity. And after this in|genious
digre&s;&s;ion you addre&s;s me in the fol|lowing
words.&mdash;Believe me there is no re|medy,
you mu&s;t acquie&s;ce. But my an&s;wer
is, that I will neither believe you nor ac|quie&s;ce;
there is a plain remedy in common
&s;en&s;e; and, to prevent &s;urpri&s;e, I de&s;ire the
Reader always to keep the controverted
point in view, to examine your rea&s;ons,
and be cautious how he takes your word,
but mo&s;t of all when you are po&s;itive or
eloquent or merry.</P>
<P N="29"><PB N="31" REF="30">
XXIX. A PAGE or two after, you
very candidly repre&s;ent your ca&s;e to be that
of an A&s;s between two bottles of hay; it
is your own expre&s;&s;ion. The cau&s;e of your
perplexity is, that you know not whether
the velocity of <HI>AB</HI> increa&s;ing or of <HI>AB</HI>
decrea&s;ing is to be e&s;teemed the Fluxion, or
proportional to the moment of the rec|tangle.
My opinion, agreeably to what
hath been premi&s;ed, is that either may be
deemed the Fluxion. But you tell us
"(<HI>P.</HI> 49.) that you think, the venerable
gho&s;t of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> whi&s;pers you,
The Velocity you &s;eek for is neither the
one nor the other of the&s;e, but is the ve|locity
which the flowing rectangle hath,
not while it is greater or le&s;s than <HI>AB,</HI>
but at that very in&s;tant of time that it is
<HI>AB.</HI>" For my part, in the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> con&s;idered &s;imply in it &s;elf, without
either increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing, I can con|ceive
no velocity at all. And if the Reader
is of my mind, he will not take either your
word, or even the word of a Gho&s;t, how
venerable &s;oever, for velocity without mo|tion.
You proceed and tell us that, in like
manner, the moment of the rectangle is
neither its increment or decrement. This
you would have us believe on the authority
of his Gho&s;t, in direct oppo&s;ition to what
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> him&s;elf a&s;&s;erted when alive. <HI>In|crementa</HI>

your &s;tyle bid the Reader believe me, but
believe his eyes.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. TO me it verily &s;eems, that you
have undertaken the defence of what you
do not under&s;tand. To mend the matter,
you &s;ay, "you do not con&s;ider <HI>AB</HI> as ly|ing
at either extremity of the moment,
but as extended to the middle of it; as
having acquired the one half of the mo|ment,
and as being about to acquire the
other; or, as having lo&s;t one half of it,
and being about to lo&s;e the other." Now,
in the name of Truth, I intreat you to
tell what this moment is, to the middle
whereof the rectangle is extended? This
moment, I &s;ay, which is acquired, which
is lo&s;t, which is cut in two, or di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
into halfs? Is it a finite quantity, or an
infinite&s;imal, or a mere limit, or nothing
at all? Take it in what &s;en&s;e you will, I
cannot make your defence either con&s;i&s;tent
or intelligible. For if you take it in either
of the two former &s;en&s;es, you contradict
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> And if you take it in
<PB N="33" REF="32">
either of the latter, you contradict common
&s;en&s;e; it being plain, that what hath no
magnitude, or is no quantity, cannot be
divided. And here I mu&s;t intreat the Rea|der
to pre&s;erve his full freedom of mind
intire, and not weakly &s;uffer his judgment
to be overborn by your imagination and
your prejudices, by great names and au|thorities,
by Gho&s;ts and Vi&s;ions, and a|bove
all by that extreme &s;atisfaction and
complacency with which you utter your
&s;trange conceits; if words without a mean|ing
may be called &s;o. After having given
this unintelligible account, you ask with
your accu&s;tomed air, "What &s;ay you, Sir?
Is this a ju&s;t and legitimate rea&s;on for
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s proceeding as he did? I think
you mu&s;t acknowledge it to be &s;o." But
alas! I acknowledge no &s;uch thing. I find
no &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on in what you &s;ay. Let
the Reader find it if he can.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. IN the next Place (<HI>P.</HI> 50.) you
charge me with want of caution. "Ina&s;|much
(&s;ay you) as that quantity which
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> through his whole
Lemma, and all the &s;everal Ca&s;es of it,
con&s;tantly calls a <HI>Moment,</HI> without con|fining
it to be either an increment or

arbitrarily, and without any Shadow of
<PB N="34" REF="33">
of Rea&s;ou given, &s;uppo&s;ed and deter|mined
to be an increment." To which
Charge I reply that it is as untrue as it is
peremptory. For that, in the foregoing
citation from the fir&s;t ca&s;e of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s
Lemma, he expre&s;ly determines it to be an
Increment. And as this particular In&s;tance
or Pa&s;&s;age was that which I objected to, it
was rea&s;onable and proper for me to con|&s;ider
the Moment in that &s;ame Light. But
take it increment or decrement as you will,
the Objections &s;till lie, and the Difficulties
are equally in&s;uperable. You then pro|ceed
to extoll the great Author of the fluxio|nary

<HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and the Increment of the
Rectangle determined by me, are perfectly
and exactly equal, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> to be
dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum</HI>: and for proof of
this, you refer to the fir&s;t Lemma of the
fir&s;t Section of the fir&s;t Book of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s
Principles. I an&s;wer, that if <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are
real quantities, then <HI>a b</HI> is &s;omething, and
<PB N="35" REF="34">
con&s;equently makes a real difference: but
if they are nothing, then the Rectangles
whereof they are coefficients become
nothing likewi&s;e: and con&s;equently the
<HI>momentum</HI> or <HI>incrementum,</HI> whether Sir
<HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s or mine, are in that Ca&s;e nothing
at all. As for the abovementioned Lem|ma,
which you refer to, and which you
wi&s;h I had con&s;ulted &s;ooner, both for my
own &s;ake and for yours; I tell you I had
long &s;ince con&s;ulted and con&s;idered it. But
I very much doubt whether you have &s;uf|ficiently
con&s;idered that Lemma, its De|mon&s;tration,
and its Con&s;equences. For,
however that way of rea&s;oning may do in
the Method of <HI>exhau&s;tions,</HI> where quanti|ties
le&s;s than a&s;&s;ignable are regarded as
nothing; yet for a Fluxioni&s;t writing a|bout
momentums, to argue that quantities
mu&s;t be equal becau&s;e they have no a&s;&s;ign|able
difference, &s;eems the mo&s;t injudici|ous
Step that could be taken: it is direct|ly
demoli&s;hing the very Doctrine you
would defend. For it will thence follow,
that all homogeneous momentums are e|qual,
and con&s;equently the velocities,
mutations, or fluxions proportional thereto,
are all likewi&s;e equal. There is, therefore,
only one proportion of equality through|out,
which at once overthrows the whole
Sy&s;tem you undertake to defend. Your
<PB N="36" REF="35">
moments (I &s;ay) not being them&s;elves a&s;|&s;ignable
quantities, their differences cannot
be a&s;&s;ignable: and if this be true, by that
way of rea&s;oning it will follow, they are all
equal, upon which Suppo&s;ition you cannot
make one Step in the Method of Fluxiors.
It appears from hence, how unju&s;tly you
blame me (<HI>P.</HI> 32.) for omitting to give
any Account of that fir&s;t Section of the
fir&s;t Book of the <HI>Principia,</HI> wherein (you
&s;ay) the Foundation of the Method of
Fluxions is geometrically demon&s;trated and
largely explained, and difficulties and ob|jections
again&s;t it are clearly &s;olved. All
which is &s;o far from being true, that the
very fir&s;t and fundamental Lemma of that
Section is incompatible with, and &s;ubver|&s;ive
of the doctrine of Fluxions. And,
indeed, who &s;ees not that a Demon&s;tra|tion
<HI>ad ab&s;urdum more veterum</HI> proceeding
on a Suppo&s;ition, that every difference
mu&s;t be &s;ome given quantity, cannot be
admitted in, or con&s;i&s;t with, a method,
wherein Quantities, le&s;s than any given, are
&s;uppo&s;ed really to exi&s;t, and be capable of
divi&s;ion?</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. THE next point you under|take
to defend is that method for obtain|ing
a rule to find the Fluxion of any
Power of a flowing Quantity, which is
delivered in the introduction to the Qua|dratures,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
and con&s;idered in the Analy&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 13, 14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.
And here the que&s;tion between us is,
whether I have rightly repre&s;ented the &s;en&s;e
of tho&s;e words, <HI>evane&s;cant jam augmenta
illa,</HI> in rendering them, let the increments
vani&s;h, <HI>i. e.</HI> let the increments be nothing,
or let there be no increments? This you
deny, but, as your manner is, in&s;tead of
giving a rea&s;on you declaim. I, on the
contrary affirm, the increments mu&s;t be
under&s;tood to be quite gone and ab&s;olutely
nothing at all. My rea&s;on is, becau&s;e with|out
that &s;uppo&s;ition you can never bring the
quantity or expre&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="math">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> down to <GAP DESC="math">, the very thing aimed
at by &s;uppo&s;ing the evane&s;cence. Say whe|ther
this be not the truth of the ca&s;e?
Whether the former expre&s;&s;ion is not to
be reduced to the latter? And whether this
can po&s;&s;ibly be done &s;o long as <HI>o</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed
a real Quantity? I cannot indeed &s;ay
you are &s;crupulous about your affirmati|ons,
and yet I believe that even you will
not affirm this; it being mo&s;t evident, that
the product of two real quantities is &s;ome|thing
real; and that nothing real can be
<PB N="38" REF="37">
rejected either according to the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of
Geometry, or according to Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s own
principles; for the truth of which I ap|peal
to all who know any thing of the&s;e
matters. Further by <HI>evane&s;cent</HI> mu&s;t either
be meant, let them (the increments) vani&s;h
and become nothing, in the obvious &s;en&s;e,
or el&s;e let them become infinitely &s;mall.
But that this latter is not Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s &s;en&s;e
is evident from his own words in the
very &s;ame page, that is, in the la&s;t of the
Introduction to his Quadratures, where he
expre&s;sly &s;aith <HI>volui o&s;tendere quod in me|thodo
Fluxionum non opus fit figuras infinit&egrave;
parvas in Geometriam introducere.</HI> Upon
the whole, you &s;eem to have con&s;idered this
affair &s;o very &s;uperficially, as greatly to
confirm me in the opinion, you are &s;o an|gry
with, to wit, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s followers
are much more eager in applying his me|thod,
than accurate in examining his prin|ciples.
You rai&s;e a du&s;t about evane&s;cent
augments which may perhaps amu&s;e and
amaze your Reader, but I am much mi&s;|taken
if it ever in&s;tructs or enlightens him.
For, to come to the point, tho&s;e evane&s;cent
augments either are real quantities, or they
are not. If you &s;ay they are; I de&s;ire to
know, how you get rid of the rejectaneous
quantity? If you &s;ay they are not; you in|deed
get rid of tho&s;e quantities in the com|po&s;ition
whereof they are coefficients; but
<PB N="39" REF="38">
then you are of the &s;ame opinion with me,
"which opinion you are plea&s;ed to call
(<HI>P.</HI> 58.) a mo&s;t palpable, inexcu&s;able,
and unpardonable blunder, although it
be a Truth mo&s;t palpably evident".</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. NOTHING, I &s;ay, can be
plainer to any impartial Reader, than that
by the Evane&s;cence of augments, in the
above cited pa&s;&s;age, Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> means their
being actually reduced to nothing. But
to put it out of all doubt, that this is the
truth, and to convince even you, who &s;hew
&s;o little di&s;po&s;ition to be convinced, I de|&s;ire
you to look into his <HI>Analy&s;is per aequa|tiones
infinitas</HI> (<HI>P.</HI> 20.) where, in his pre|paration
for demon&s;trating the fir&s;t rule
for the &s;quaring of &s;imple Curves, you
will find that on a parallel occa&s;ion, &s;peak|ing
of an augment which is &s;uppo&s;ed to
vani&s;h, he interprets the word <HI>evane&s;cere</HI>
by <HI>e&s;&s;e nihil.</HI> Nothing can be plainer than
this, which at once de&s;troys your defence.
And yet, plain as it is, I de&s;pair of making
you acknowledge it; though I am &s;ure
you feel it, and the Reader if he u&s;eth his
eyes mu&s;t &s;ee it. The words <HI>Evane&s;cere five
e&s;&s;e nihil</HI> do (to u&s;e your own expre&s;&s;ion)
&s;tare us in the face. Lo! "This is what
you call (<HI>P.</HI> 56.) &s;o great, &s;o unaccounta|ble,
&s;o horrid, &s;o truly <HI>Boeotian</HI> a blunder"
<PB N="40" REF="39">
that, according to you, it was not po&s;&s;ible
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> could be guilty of it.
For the future, I advi&s;e you to be more
&s;paring of hard words: Since, as you in|cautiou&s;ly
deal them about, they may
chance to light on your friends as well as
your adver&s;aries. As for my part, I &s;hall
not retaliate. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay you are
mi&s;taken, But I can ea&s;ily pardon your
mi&s;takes. Though, indeed, you tell me
on this very occa&s;ion, that I mu&s;t expect
no quarter from Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s followers. And
I tell you that I neither expect nor de&s;ire
any. My aim is truth. My rea&s;ons I have
given. Confute them, if you can. But
think not to overbear me either with au|thorities
or har&s;h words. The latter will
recoil upon your &s;elves: The former in a
matter of &s;cience are of no weight with
indifferent Readers; and as for Bigots, I
am not concerned about what they &s;ay or
think.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. IN the next place you pro|ceed
to declaim upon the following pa&s;|&s;age
taken from the &s;eventeenth &s;ection of
the Analy&s;t. "Con&s;idering the various
arts and devices u&s;ed by the great au|thor
of the fluxionary method: In how
many lights he placeth his Fluxions:
and in what different ways he attempts to
<PB N="41" REF="40">
demon&s;trate the &s;ame point: One would
be inclined to think, he was him&s;elf &s;u&s;|picious
of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own de|mon&s;trations."
This pa&s;&s;age you com|plain
of as very hard u&s;age of Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton.</HI> You declaim copiou&s;ly, and en|deavour
to &s;hew that placing the &s;ame
point in various lights is of great u&s;e to
explain it; which you illu&s;trate with much
Rhetoric. But the fault of that pa&s;&s;age is
not the hard u&s;age it contains: But on the
contrary, that it is too mode&s;t, and not
&s;o full and expre&s;&s;ive of my &s;en&s;e, as per|haps
it &s;hould have been. Would you like
it better if I &s;hould &s;ay, the various <HI>incon|&s;i&s;tent</HI>
accounts, which this great author
gives of his momentums and his fluxions,
may convince every intelligent Reader
that he had no clear and &s;teady notions of
them, without which there can be no de|mon&s;tration?
I own frankly that I &s;ee no
clearne&s;s or con&s;i&s;tence in them. You tell
me indeed, in <HI>Miltonic</HI> ver&s;e, that the fault
is in my own eyes,
<Q><L>So thick a drop &s;erene has quench'd their orbs.</L>
<L>Or dim Suffu&s;ion veil'd.</L></Q>
At the &s;ame time you acknowledge your
&s;elf obliged for tho&s;e various lights, which
have enabled you to under&s;tand his Doc|trine.
<PB N="42" REF="41">
But as for me who do not under&s;tand
it, you in&s;ult me, &s;aying: "For God's &s;ake
what is it you are offended at, who do
not &s;till under&s;tand him"? May not I
an&s;wer, that I am offended for this very
rea&s;on; becau&s;e I cannot under&s;tand him
or make &s;en&s;e of what he &s;ays? You &s;ay
to me, that I am all in the dark. I ac|knowledge
it, and intreat you who &s;ee &s;o
clearly, to help me out.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. YOU, Sir, with the bright
eyes, be plea&s;ed to tell me, whether Sir
<HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s momentum be a finite quantity, or
an infinite&s;imal, or a mere limit? If you
&s;ay, a finite quantity: Be plea&s;ed to recon|cile
this with what he &s;aith in the Scho|lium
of the &s;econd Lemma of the fir&s;t
Section of the fir&s;t book of his Principles:
<HI>Cave intelligas quantitates magnitudine de|terminatas,
&s;ed cogita &s;emper diminuendas
&s;ine limite.</HI> If you &s;ay, an infinite&s;imal:
reconcile this with what is &s;aid in the
Introduction to his Quadratures: <HI>Volui
oftendere quod in methodo Flaxionum non
opus fit figuras infinit&egrave; parvas in Geome|triam
introducere.</HI> If you &s;hould &s;ay, it
is a mere limit, be plea&s;ed to reconcile
this with what we find in the fir&s;t ca&s;e
of the &s;econd Lemma in the &s;econd book
of his principles: <HI>Ubi de lateribus A et B
<PB N="43" REF="42">
deerant momentorum dimidia,</HI> &amp;c. where the
moments are &s;uppo&s;ed to be divided. I
&s;hould be very glad, a per&s;on of &s;uch lu|minous
intellect would be &s;o good as to
explain, whether by Fluxions we are to
under&s;tand the na&s;cent or evane&s;cent quan|tities
them&s;elves, or their motions, or their
Velocities, or &s;imply their proportions:
and having interpreted them in what &s;en&s;e
you will, that you would then conde|&s;cend
to explain the Doctrine of &s;econd,
third, and fourth Fluxions, and &s;hew it
to be con&s;i&s;tent with common &s;en&s;e if you
can. You &s;eem to be very &s;anguine when
you expre&s;s your &s;elf in the following
terms. "I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, from my
own Experience, and that of many o|thers
whom I could name, that the
Doctrine may be clearly conceived and
di&s;tinctly comprehended" (<HI>p.</HI> 31.) And it
may be uncivil not to believe what you
&s;o &s;olemnly affirm, from your own ex|perience.
But I mu&s;t needs own, I &s;hould
be better fatisfied of this, if, in&s;tead of
entertaining us with your Rhetoric, you
would vouch&s;afe to reconcile tho&s;e diffi|culties,
and explain tho&s;e ob&s;cure points
abovementioned. If either you, or any one of
tho&s;e many whom you could name, will but
explain to others what you &s;o clearly con|ceive
your &s;elves, I give you my word
<PB N="44" REF="43">
that &s;everal will be obliged to you who,
I may venture to &s;ay, under&s;tand tho&s;e
matters no more than my &s;elf. But, if
I am not much mi&s;taken, you and your
friends will mode&s;tly decline this task.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. I HAVE long ago done
what you &s;o often exhort me to do, dili|gently
read and con&s;idered the &s;everal ac|counts
of this Doctrine given by the great
Author in different parts of his writings: and
upon the whole I could never make it out
to be con&s;i&s;tent and intelligible. I was
even led to &s;ay, "that one would be in|clined
to think, He was him&s;elf &s;u&s;pi|cious
of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own demon|&s;trations:
and that he was not enough
plea&s;ed with any one Notion &s;teadily
to adhere to it." After which I ad|ded,
"Thus much is plain that he own|ed
him&s;elf &s;atisfied concerning certain
points, which neverthele&s;s he could not
undertake to demon&s;trate to others."
See the &s;eventeenth &s;ection of the Analy&s;t.
It is one thing when a Doctrine is placed
in various lights: and another, when the
principles and notions are &s;hifted. When
new devices are introduced and &s;ub&s;titu|ted
for others, a Doctrine in&s;tead of being
illu&s;trated may be explained away. Whe|ther
there be not &s;omething of this in
<PB N="45" REF="44">
the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I appeal to the writings
of the Great Author. His <HI>methodus ra|tionum
primarum et ultimarum,</HI> His &s;econd
Lemma in the &s;econd book of his prin|ciples,
his Introduction and Treati&s;e of
the Quadrature of Curves. In all which
it appears to me, there is not one uniform
doctrine explained and carried throughout
the whole, but rather &s;undry incon&s;i&s;tent
accounts of this new Method, which &s;till
grows more dark and confu&s;ed the more
it is handled: I could not help thinking,
the greate&s;t genius might lie under the
influence of fal&s;e principles; and where
the object and notions were exceeding ob|&s;cure,
he might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;tru&s;t even his
own demon&s;trations. "At lea&s;t thus
much &s;eemed plain, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> had
&s;ometime owned him&s;elf &s;atisfied, where
he could not demon&s;trate to others. In
proof whereof I mentioned his letter
to Mr. <HI>Collins</HI>; Hereupon you tell me:
there is a great deal of difference be|tween
&s;aying, I cannot undertake to
prove a thing, and I will not under|take
it." But in an&s;wer to this, I de|&s;ire
you will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that
I was not making a preci&s;e extract out of
that letter, in which the very words of
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> &s;hould alone be in&s;erted. But
I made my own remark and inference,
<PB N="46" REF="45">
from what I remembred to have read in
that letter; where, &s;peaking of a certain
Mathematical matter, Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> expre&s;&s;eth
him&s;elf, in the following terms. "It is
plain to me by the fountain I draw it
from; though I will not undertake to
prove it to others." Now whether my
inference may not be fairly drawn from
tho&s;e words of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>; and
whether the difference as to the &s;en&s;e be
&s;o great between <HI>will</HI> and <HI>can</HI> in that
particular ca&s;e, I leave to be determined
by the Reader.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. IN the next paragraph you
talk big, but prove nothing. You &s;peak of
driving out of intrenchments, of &s;allying
and attacking and carrying by a&s;&s;ault; of
&s;light and untenable works, of a new-rai&s;ed
and undi&s;ciplined militia, and of veteran
regular troops. Need the Reader be a Ma|thematician
to &s;ee the vanity of this para|graph?
After this you employ (<HI>p.</HI> 65) your
u&s;ual colouring, and repre&s;ent the great
Author of the method of Fluxions "as
a Good old Gentleman fa&s;t a&s;leep, and
&s;noring in his ea&s;y chair; while dame
Fortune is bringing him her apron full
of beautiful theorems and problems,
which he never knows or thinks of."
This you would have pa&s;s for a con&s;e|quence
<PB N="47" REF="46">
of my notions. But I appeal to all
tho&s;e who are ever &s;o little knowing in
&s;uch matters, whether there are not divers
fountains of Experiment, Induction, and
Analogy, whence a man may derive and
&s;atisfy him&s;elf concerning the truth of ma|ny
points in Mathematics and Mechanical
Philo&s;ophy, although the proofs thereof
afforded by the modern Analy&s;is &s;hould
not amount to demon&s;tration? I further
appeal to the con&s;cience of all the mo&s;t
profound Mathematicians, whether they
can, with perfect acquie&s;cence of mind free
from all &s;cruple, apply any propo&s;ition
merely upon the &s;trength of a Demon&s;tra|tion
involving &s;econd or third Fluxions,
without the aid of any &s;uch experiment or
analogy or collateral proof what&s;oever?
La&s;tly, I appeal to the Reader's own heart,
whether he cannot clearly conceive a me|dium
between being fa&s;t a&s;leep and demon|&s;trating?
But you will have it, that I re|pre&s;ent
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Conclu&s;ions as com|ing
out right, becau&s;e one error is compen|&s;ated
by another contrary and equal error,
which perhaps he never knew him&s;elf nor
thought of: that by a twofold mi&s;take he
arrives though not at &s;cience yet at Truth:
that he proceeds blindfold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which
is untruly &s;aid by you, who have mi&s;ap|plied
to Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> what was intended for
the Marquis <HI>de l' Ho&s;pital</HI> and his fol|lowers,
<PB N="48" REF="47">
for no other end (as I can &s;ee) but
that you may have an opportunity to draw
that ingenious portraiture of Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI> and Dame Fortune, as will be ma|nife&s;t
to whoever reads the Analy&s;t.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. YOU tell me (<HI>p.</HI> 70), if I
think fit to per&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting, "that this
affair of a double error is entirely a new
di&s;covery of my own, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>
and his followers never knew nor
thought of, that you have unque&s;tiona|ble
evidence to convince me of the con|trary,
and that all his followers are
already appri&s;ed, that this very objecti|on
of mine was long &s;ince fore&s;een,
and clearly and fully removed by
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> in the fir&s;t &s;ection
of the fir&s;t book of his <HI>Principia</HI>".
All which I do as &s;trongly deny as
you affirm. And I do aver, that this is
an unque&s;tionable proof of the matchle&s;s
contempt which you, <HI>Philalethes,</HI> have for
Truth. And I do here publickly call up|on
you, to produce that evidence which
you pretend to have, and to make good
that fact which you &s;o confidently affirm.
And, at the &s;ame time, I do a&s;&s;ure the
Reader that you never will, nor can.</P>
<P N="40"><PB N="49" REF="48">
XL. IF you defend Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s notions
as delivered in his <HI>Principia,</HI> it mu&s;t be
on the rigorous foot of rejecting nothing,
neither admitting nor ca&s;ting away infi|nitely
&s;mall quantities. If you defend the
Marquis, whom you al&s;o &s;tile your Ma|&s;ter,
it mu&s;t be on the foot of admitting
that there are infinite&s;imals, that may be
rejected, that they are neverthele&s;s real
quantities, and them&s;elves infinitely &s;ub|divi&s;ible.
But you &s;eem to have grown
giddy with pa&s;&s;ion, and in the heat of
controver&s;y to have mi&s;taken and forgot
your part. I be&s;eech you, Sir, to con&s;ider,
that the Marquis (whom alone, and not
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> this double error in finding the
&s;ubtangent doth concern) rejects indeed in|finite&s;imals,
but not on the foot that you
do, to wit, their being incon&s;iderable in
practical Geometry or mixed Mathematics.
But he rejects them in the accuracy of Spe|culative
Knowledge: in which re&s;pect
there may be great Logical errors, al|though
there &s;hould be no &s;en&s;ible mi&s;take
in practice: which, it &s;eems, is what you
cannot comprehend. He rejects them like|wi&s;e
in virtue of a Po&s;tulatum, which I
venture to call rejecting them without ce|remony.
And though he inferreth a con|clu&s;ion
accurately true, yet he doth it,
contrary to the rules of Logic, from inac|curate
<PB N="50" REF="49">
and fal&s;e premi&s;es, And how this
comes about, I have at large explained in
the Analy&s;t, and &s;hewed in that particular
ca&s;e of Tangents, that the Rejectaneous
Quantity might have been a finite quanti|ty
of any given magnitude, and yet the
conclu&s;ion have come out exactly the &s;ame
way; and con&s;equently, that the truth of
this method doth not depend on the rea&s;on
a&s;&s;igned by the Marquis, to wit, the <HI>po&s;tu|latum</HI>
for throwing away Infinite&s;imals;
and therefore that he and his followers
acted blindfold, as not knowing the true
rea&s;on for the conclu&s;ion's coming out ac|curately
right, which I &s;hew to have been
the effect of a double error.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. THIS is the truth of the matter,
which you &s;hamefully mi&s;repre&s;ent and
declaim upon, to no &s;ort of purpo&s;e but
to amu&s;e and mi&s;lead your Reader. For
which conduct of yours throughout your
remarks, you will pardon me if I cannot
otherwi&s;e account, than from a &s;ecret
hope that the reader of your defence would
never read the Analy&s;t. If he doth, He
cannot but &s;ee what an admirable Method

of ju&s;tifying the Rea&s;oning, the Lo|gic
or the Theory of the ca&s;e &s;pecified,
<PB N="51" REF="50">
which is the real point, you di&s;cour&s;e of
&s;en&s;ible and practical errors: And how all
this is a manife&s;t impo&s;ition upon the
Reader. He mu&s;t needs &s;ee that I have
expre&s;ly &s;aid, "I have no controver&s;y ex|cept
only about your Logic and me|thod:
that I con&s;ider how you demon|&s;trate;
what objects you are conver&s;ant
about; and whether you conceive them
clearly? That I have often expre&s;&s;ed
my &s;elf to the &s;ame effect, de&s;iring the
Reader to remember, that I am only
concerned about the way of coming at
your theorems, whether it be legitimate
or illegitimate, clear or ob&s;cure, &s;cienti|fic
or tentative: That I have on this ve|ry
occa&s;ion, to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of
mi&s;take, repeated and in&s;i&s;ted that I
con&s;ider the Geometrical Analy&s;t as a
Logician, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o far forth as he rea&s;ons
and argues; and his mathematical con|clu&s;ions
not in them&s;elves but in their
premi&s;es; not as true or fal&s;e, u&s;eful or
in&s;ignificant, but as derived from &s;uch
principles, and by &s;uch inferences"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> Sect. XX.</NOTE>.
You affirm (and indeed what can you not
affirm?) that the difference between the
true &s;ubtangent and that found without
any compen&s;ation is ab&s;olutely nothing at
all. I profe&s;s my &s;elf of a contrary opini|on.
<PB N="52" REF="51">
My rea&s;on is becau&s;e nothing cannot
be divided into parts. But this difference
is capable of being divided into any, or
into more than any given number of parts;
For the truth of which con&s;ult the Mar|quit
<HI>de l' Ho&s;pital.</HI> And, be the error in
fact or in practice ever &s;o &s;mall, it will
not thence follow that the error in Rea|&s;oning,
which is what I am alone con|cerned
about, is one whit the le&s;s, it being
evident that a man may rea&s;on mo&s;t ab&s;urd|ly
about the minute&s;t things.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. PRAY an&s;wer me fairly, once
for all, whether it be your opinion that
what&s;oever is little and incon&s;iderable e|nough
to be rejected without inconve|nience
in practice, the &s;ame may in like
manner be &s;afely rejected and overlooked
in Theory and Demon&s;tration. If you &s;ay
<HI>no,</HI> it will then follow, that all you have
been &s;aying here and el&s;ewhere, about
yards and inches and decimal fractions, &s;et|ting
forth and in&s;i&s;ting on the extreme &s;mall|ne&s;s
of the rejectaneous quantity, is quite
foreign to the argument, and only a piece
of skill to impo&s;e upon your Reader. If
you &s;ay <HI>yes,</HI> it follows that you then give
up at once all the orders of Fluxions and
Infinite&s;imal Differences; and &s;o mo&s;t im|prudently
turn all your &s;allies and attacks
<PB N="53" REF="52">
and Veterans to your own overthrow. If
the Reader is of my mind, he will de|&s;pair
of ever &s;eeing you get clear of this
Dilemma. The points in controver&s;y have
been &s;o often and &s;o di&s;tinctly noted in the
Analy&s;t, that I very much wonder how
you could mi&s;take if you had no mind to
mi&s;take. It is very plain, if you are in
earne&s;t, that you neither under&s;tand me
nor your Ma&s;ters. And what &s;hall we
think of other ordinary Analy&s;ts, when it
&s;hall be found that even you, who, like a
Champion &s;tep forth to defend their prin|ciples,
have not con&s;idered them.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. THE impartial Reader is in|treated
to remark throughout your whole
performance, how confident you are in a&s;|&s;erting,
and withall how mode&s;t in proving
or explaining: How frequent it is with
you to employ Figures and Tropes in|&s;tead
of Rea&s;ons: How many difficulties
propo&s;ed in the Analy&s;t are di&s;creetly over|looked
by you, and what &s;trange work
you make with the re&s;t: How gro&s;ly you
mi&s;take and mi&s;repre&s;ent, and how little
you practi&s;e the advice which you &s;o libe|rally
be&s;tow. Believe me, Sir, I had long
and maturely con&s;idered the principles of
the modern Analy&s;is, before I ventured to
publi&s;h my thoughts thereupon in the
<PB N="54" REF="53">
Analy&s;t. And &s;ince the publication there|of,
I have my &s;elf freely conver&s;ed with
Mathematicians of all ranks, and &s;ome of
the able&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors, as well as made it my
bu&s;ine&s;s to be informed of the Opinions of
others, being very de&s;irous to hear what
could be &s;aid towards clearing my diffi|culties
or an&s;wering my objections. But
though you are not afraid or a&s;hamed to
repre&s;ent the Analy&s;ts as very clear and uni|form
in their Conception of the&s;e matters,
yet I do &s;olemnly affirm (and &s;everal of
them&s;elves know it to be true) that I found
no harmony or agreement among them,
but the rever&s;e thereof, the greate&s;t di&s;&s;o|nance,
and even contrariety of Opinions,
employed to explain what after all &s;eem|ed
inexplicable.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. SOME fly to proportions be|tween
nothings. Some reject quantities be|cau&s;e
infinite&s;imal. Others allow only finite
quantities, and reject them becau&s;e incon|&s;iderable.
Others place the method of
Fluxions on a foot with that of <HI>Exhau&s;t|ions,</HI>
and admit nothing new therein.
Some maintain the clear conception of
Fluxions. Others hold they can demon|&s;trate
about things incomprehen&s;ible. Some
would prove the Algori&s;m of Fluxions
by <HI>reductio ad ab&s;urdum</HI>; others <HI>a priori.</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="54">
Some hold the evane&s;cent increments to
be real quantities, &s;ome to be nothings,
&s;ome to be limits. As many Men, &s;o
many minds: Each differing one from
another, and all from Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI>
Some plead inaccurate expre&s;&s;ions in the
great Author, whereby they would draw
him to &s;peak their &s;en&s;e, not con&s;idering
that if he meant as they do, he could not
want words to expre&s;s his meaning.
Others are magi&s;terial and po&s;itive, &s;ay
they are &s;atisfied, and that is all, not con|&s;idering
that we, who deny Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI>'s Authority, &s;hall not &s;ubmit to
that of his Di&s;ciples. Some in&s;i&s;t, that
the Conclu&s;ions are true, and therefore the
principles, not con&s;idering what hath been
largely &s;aid in the Analy&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sect.</HI> XIX, XX. &amp;c.</NOTE> on that head.
La&s;tly &s;everal (and tho&s;e none of the
meane&s;t) frankly owned the objections to
be unan&s;werable. All which I mention
by way of Antidote to your fal&s;e Colours:
and that the unprejudiced Inquirer after
Truth may &s;ee, it is not without founda|tion,
that I call on the celebrated Mathema|ticians
of the pre&s;ent Age to clear up
the&s;e ob&s;cure Analytics, and concur in giv|ing
to the publick &s;ome con&s;i&s;tent and
intelligible account of the principles of
their great Ma&s;ter: which if they do not,
<PB N="56" REF="55">
I believe the World will take it for gran|ted
that they cannot.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. HAVING gone through your
Defence of the Briti&s;h Mathematicians, I
find in the next place, that you attack me
on a point of Metaphy&s;ics, with what
&s;ucce&s;s the Reader will determine. I had
upon another Occa&s;ion many years ago
wrote again&s;t Ab&s;tract general Ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction to a Treati&s;e concerning the Principles of Hu|man Knowledge, printed in the Year MDCCX.</NOTE>. In
oppo&s;ition to which, you declare your &s;elf
to adhere to the vulgar opinion, that nei|ther
Geometry nor any other general Sci|ence
can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without general Ideas.
(<HI>P.</HI> 74.) This implies that I hold there are
no general Ideas. But I hold the direct
contrary, that there are indeed general Ideas,
but not formed by ab&s;traction in the man|ner
&s;et forth by Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI> To me it
is plain, there is no con&s;i&s;tent Idea, the
likene&s;s whereof may not really exi&s;t.
What&s;oever therefore is &s;aid to be &s;ome|what
which cannot exi&s;t, the Idea thereof
mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> acknowledg|eth
it doth require Pains and Skill to form
his general Idea of a Triangle. He further
expre&s;ly &s;aith, it mu&s;t be neither oblique
nor rectangular, neither equilateral, equi|crural,
nor &s;calenum; but all and none
<PB N="57" REF="56">
of the&s;e at once. He al&s;o &s;aith, it is an
Idea wherein &s;ome parts of &s;everal diffe|rent
and incon&s;i&s;tent Ideas are put toge|ther<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Humane Under&s;tanding.</HI> b. iv. c. vii. &sect;. ix.</NOTE>.
All this looks very like a Con|tradiction.
But to put the Matter pa&s;t
di&s;pute, it mu&s;t be noted, that he affirms
it to be &s;omewhat imperfect that cannot ex|i&s;t;
con&s;equently the Idea thereof is im|po&s;&s;ible
or incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. I DESIRE to know, whether
it is not po&s;&s;ible for any thing to exi&s;t,
which doth not include a contradiction:
And if it is, whether we may not infer,
that what cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, the &s;ame
doth include a contradiction: I further
de&s;ire to know, whether the reader can
frame a di&s;tinct idea of any thing that
includes a contradiction? For my part, I
cannot, nor con&s;equently of the above|mentioned
Triangle; Though you (who it
&s;eems know better than my &s;elf what I
can do) are plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure me of the
contrary. Again, I ask whether that,
which it is above the power of man to
form a compleat idea of, may not be
called incomprehen&s;ible? And whether the
Reader can frame a compleat idea of this
imperfect, impo&s;&s;ible Triangle? And if
not, whether it doth not follow that it
<PB N="58" REF="57">
is incomprehen&s;ible? It &s;hould &s;eem, that
a di&s;tinct aggregate of a few con&s;i&s;tent
parts was nothing &s;o difficult to conceive,
or impo&s;&s;ible to exi&s;t; and that, therefore
your Comment mu&s;t be wide of the Au|thor's
meaning. You give me to under|&s;tand
(<HI>P.</HI> 82.) that this account of a ge|neral
Triangle was a trap which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>
&s;et to catch fools. Who is caught therein
let the Reader judge.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. IT is Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s opinion,
that every general name &s;tands for a ge|neral
ab&s;tract idea, which pre&s;cinds from
the &s;pecies or individuals comprehended
under it. Thus, for example, according
to him, the general name <HI>Colour</HI> &s;tands
for an idea, which is neither Blue, Red,
Green nor any other particular colour, but
&s;omewhat di&s;tinct and ab&s;tracted from them
all. To me it &s;eems, the word <HI>Colour</HI> is
only a more general name applicable to
all and each of the particular colours;
while the other &s;pecific names, as Blue,
Red, Green, and the like are each re|&s;trained
to a more limited &s;ignification.
The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the word Tri|angle.
Let the Reader judge whether
this be not the ca&s;e; and whether he can
di&s;tinctly frame &s;uch an idea of colour
as &s;hall pre&s;cind from all the &s;pecies there|of,
<PB N="59" REF="58">
or of a triangle which &s;hall an&s;wer
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s account, pre&s;cinding and ab|&s;tracting
from all the particular &s;orts of
triangles, in the manner afore&s;aid.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. I intreat my Reader to think.
For if he doth not, he may be under &s;ome
influence from your confident and po&s;itive
way of talking. But any one who thinks
may, if I mi&s;take not, plainly perceive
that you are deluded, as it often happens,
by mi&s;taking the terms for ideas. Nothing
is ea&s;ier, than to define in terms or words
that which is incomprehen&s;ible in idea,
fora&s;much as any words can be either &s;e|parated
or joined as you plea&s;e, but ideas
always cannot. It is as ea&s;y to &s;ay a round
&s;quare as an oblong &s;quare, though the for|mer
be inconceivable. If the Reader will
but take a little care to di&s;tingui&s;h between
the Definition and the Idea, between words
or expre&s;&s;ions and the conceptions of the
mind, he will judge of the truth of what
I now advance, and clearly perceive how
far you are mi&s;taken, in attempting to illu|&s;trate
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Doctrine, and where your
mi&s;take lies. Or, if the Reader is minded to
make &s;hort work, he needs only at once to
try whether laying a&s;ide the words he can
frame in his mind the idea of an impo&s;&s;i|ble
triangle; upon which trial the i&s;&s;ue of
<PB N="60" REF="59">
this di&s;pute may be fairly put. This do|ctrine
of ab&s;tract general ideas &s;eemed to
me a capital error, productive of number|le&s;s
difficulties and di&s;putes, that runs not
only throughout Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s book, but
through mo&s;t parts of Learning. Con&s;e|quently,
my animadver&s;ions thereupon
were not an effect of being inclined to carp
or cavil at a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, as you would
wrongfully in&s;inuate, but proceeded from
a love of Truth and a de&s;ire to bani&s;h, &s;o
far as in me lay, fal&s;e principles and wrong
ways of thinking, without re&s;pect of per|&s;ons.
And indeed, though you and other
Party-men are violently attached to your
re&s;pective Ma&s;ters, yet I, who profe&s;s my
&s;elf only attached to Truth, &s;ee no rea&s;on
why I may not as freely animadvert on
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> or Sit <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> as they
would on <HI>Ari&s;tole</HI> or <HI>De&s;cartes.</HI> Certainly
the more exten&s;ive the influence of any
Error, and the greater the authority which
&s;upports it, the more it de&s;erves to be con|&s;idered
and detected by &s;incere Inquirers
after Knowledge.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. IN the clo&s;e of your perfor|mance,
you let me under&s;tand, that your
Zeal for Truth and the reputation of your
Ma&s;ters hath occa&s;ioned your reprehending
me with the utmo&s;t freedom. And it mu&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="60">
be owned you have &s;hewn a &s;ingular talent
therein. But I am comforted under the
&s;everity of your reprehen&s;ions, when I con|&s;ider
the weakne&s;s of your arguments,
which, were they as &s;trong as your reproofs,
could leave no doubt in the mind of the
Reader concerning the matters in di&s;pute
between us. As it is, I leave him to re|flect
and examine by your light, how clear|ly
he is enabled to conceive a fluxion, or
the fluxion of a fluxion, a part infinitely
&s;mall &s;ubdivided into an infinity of parts, a
na&s;cent or evane&s;cent increment, that
which is neither &s;omething nor nothing, a
triangle formed in a point, velocity with|out
motion, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>arcana</HI>
of the modern Analy&s;is. To conclude, I
had &s;ome thoughts of advi&s;ing you how
to conduct your &s;elf for the future, in re|turn
for the advice you have &s;o freely im|parted
to me: but, as you think it becomes
me rather to inform my &s;elf than in&s;truct
others, I &s;hall, for my further information,
take leave to propo&s;e a few Queries to
tho&s;e learned Gentlemen of <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
whom you a&s;&s;ociate with your &s;elf, and re|pre&s;ent
as being equally &s;urpri&s;ed at the
tendency of my Analy&s;t.</P>
<P N="50">L. I de&s;ire to know, whether tho&s;e
who can neither demon&s;trate nor conceive
<PB N="62" REF="61">
the principles of the modern Analy&s;is, and
yet give into it, may not be ju&s;tly &s;aid to
have Faith, and be &s;tyled believers of my&s;|teries?
Whether it is impo&s;&s;ible to find a|mong
the Phy&s;icians, mechanical Philo&s;o|phers,
Mathematicians, and Philomathe|maticians
of the pre&s;ent age, &s;ome &s;uch
Believers, who yet deride Chri&s;tians for
their belief of My&s;teries? Whether with
&s;uch men it is not a fair, rea&s;onable, and
legitimate method to u&s;e the <HI>Argumentum
ad Hominem</HI>? And being &s;o, whether it
ought to &s;urpri&s;e either Chri&s;tians or Scho|lars?
Whether in an age wherein &s;o ma|ny
pretenders to &s;cience attack the Chri|&s;tian
Religion, we may not be allowed
to make repri&s;als, in order to &s;hew that
the Irreligion of tho&s;e men is not to be
pre&s;umed an effect of deep and ju&s;t think|ing?
Whether an attempt to detect fal&s;e
rea&s;onings, and remedy defects in Mathe|matics,
ought to be ill received by Ma|thematicians?
Whether the introducing
more ea&s;y methods and more intelligible
principles in any &s;cience &s;hould be di&s;|countenanced?
Whether there may not be
fair objections as well as cavils? And whe|ther
to inquire diligently into the meaning
of terms and the proof of propo&s;itions,
not excepting again&s;t any thing without
a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on, nor affecting to mi&s;take
<PB N="63" REF="62">
the &s;ignification of words, or &s;tick at an
expre&s;&s;ion where the &s;en&s;e was clear, but
con&s;idering the &s;ubject in all lights, &s;in|cerely
endeavouring to find out any &s;en&s;e
or meaning what&s;oever, candidly &s;etting
forth what &s;eems ob&s;cure and what fal|lacious,
and calling upon tho&s;e, who pro|fe&s;s
the knowledge of &s;uch matters, to
explain them; whether, I &s;ay, &s;uch a pro|ceeding
can be ju&s;tly called cavilling?
Whether there be an <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> erected?
And if &s;o, when, where, by whom, and
upon what Authority? Whether even
where Authority was to take place, one
might not hope the Mathematics, at lea&s;t,
would be excepted? Whether the chief
end, in making Mathematics &s;o con&s;ide|rable
a part of Academical Education, be
not to form in the minds of young Stu|dents
habits of ju&s;t and exact Rea&s;oning?
And whether the &s;tudy of ab&s;tru&s;e and
&s;ubtile matters can conduce to this end,
unle&s;s they are well under&s;tood, examin|ed,
and &s;ifted to the bottom? Whether,
therefore, the bringing Geometrical demon|&s;trations
to the &s;evere&s;t te&s;t of Rea&s;on
&s;hould be reckoned a di&s;couragement to
the &s;tudies of any learned Society? Whe|ther
to &s;eparate the clear parts of things
from the ob&s;cure, to di&s;tingui&s;h the real
Principles, whereon Truths re&s;t, and
<PB N="64" REF="63">
whence they are derived, and to propor|tion
the ju&s;t mea&s;ures of a&s;&s;ent according
to the various degrees of evidence, be an
u&s;ele&s;s or unworthy Undertaking? Whe|ther
the making more of an argument
than it will bear, and placing it in an un|due
rank of evidence, be not the likely
way to di&s;parage it? Whether it may not
be of &s;ome u&s;e, to provoke and &s;tir up
the learned profe&s;&s;ors to explain a part of
Mathematical Learning, which is acknow|ledged
to be mo&s;t profound, difficult, and
ob&s;cure, and at the &s;ame time &s;et forth
by <HI>Philalethes</HI> and many others, as the
greate&s;t in&s;tance that has ever been given
of the extent of humane abilities? Whe|ther
for the &s;ake of a Great man's di&s;co|veries,
we mu&s;t adopt his errors? La&s;tly,
whether in an age wherein all other prin|ciples
are canva&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t free|dom,
the principles of Fluxions are to
be alone excepted?</P>

Mr. WALTON's
VINDICATION
Of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Principles
of FLUXIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. _I HAD no &s;ooner con&s;idered
the performance of <HI>Philale|thes,</HI>
but Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s Vindi|cation
of Fluxions was put
into my hands. As this <HI>Dub|lin</HI>

from Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s <HI>Principia,</HI>
and enlarge on a hint or two of <HI>Philale|thes,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="65">
he de&s;erves no particular notice. It
may &s;uffice to adverti&s;e the Reader, that
the foregoing Defence, contains a full and
explicite An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> as he will
find, if he thinks it worth his pains to
read what this Gentleman hath written,
and compare it therewith: Particularly
with Sect. 18, 20, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
43. It is not, I am &s;ure, worth mine to
repeat the &s;ame things, or confute the &s;ame
notions twice over, in mere regard to a
writer who hath copied even the manners
of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> and whom in an&s;wering the
other I have, if I am not much mi&s;taken,
&s;ufficiently an&s;wered.</P>
<P N="2">II. MR. <HI>Walton</HI> touches on the &s;ame
points that the other had touched upon be|fore
him. He pur&s;ues a hint which the other
had given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philalethes,</HI> p. 32.</NOTE>, about Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s fir&s;t Section
concerning <HI>Rationes primae &amp; ultimae.</HI> He
di&s;creetly avoids, like the other, to &s;ay one
&s;yllable of &s;econd, third, or fourth Fluxi|ons,
and of divers other points mentioned
in the Analy&s;t, about all which I ob&s;erve
in him a mo&s;t prudent and profound &s;i|lence.
And yet he very mode&s;tly gives his
Reader to under&s;tand, that he is able to
clear up all difficulties and objections, that
have ever been made (<HI>P.</HI> 5.). Mr. <HI>Walton</HI> in
<PB N="67" REF="66">
the beginning, like <HI>Philalethes,</HI> from a par|ticular
ca&s;e makes a general in erence,
&s;uppo&s;ing that Infidelity to be imputed to
Mathematicians in general, which I &s;uppo&s;e
only in the per&s;on to whom the Analy&s;t
was addre&s;&s;ed, and certain other per&s;ons of
the &s;ame mind with him: Whether this
extraordinary way of rea&s;oning be the cau&s;e
or effect of his pa&s;&s;ion, I know not: But
before I had got to the end of his Vindi|cation,
I cea&s;ed to be &s;urprized at his Lo|gic
and his temper in the beginning. The
double error, which in the Analy&s;t was
plainly meant to belong to others, he with
<HI>Philalethes</HI> (who&s;e very over&s;ights he ad|opts)
&s;uppo&s;eth to have been a&s;cribed to
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> (<HI>P.</HI> 38.) And this wri|ter
al&s;o, as well as the <HI>Cantabrigian,</HI> mu&s;t
needs take upon him to explain the mo|tive
of my writing again&s;t Fluxions:
which he gives out, with great a&s;&s;urance,
to have been, becau&s;e Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
had pre&s;umed to interpo&s;e in Prophecies
and Revelations, and to decide in religi|ons
affairs (<HI>P.</HI> 4.) which is &s;o far from be|ing
true, that, on the contrary, I have a
high value for tho&s;e learned remains of
that Great Man, who&s;e original and free
Genius is an eternal reproach to that tribe
of followers, who are always imitating,
but never re&s;emble him. This &s;pecimen
<PB N="68" REF="67">
of Mr. <HI>Walton</HI>'s truth will be a warning
to the Reader to u&s;e his own eyes, and
in ob&s;cure points never to tru&s;t the Gen|tleman's
Candour, who dares to mi&s;repre|&s;ent
the plaine&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">III. I WAS thinking to have &s;aid no
more concerning this Author's perform|ance.
But le&s;t he &s;hould imagine him&s;elf
too much neglected, I intreat the Reader
to have the patience to peru&s;e it; and if
he finds any one point of the doctrine of
Fluxions cleared up, or any one objection
in the Analy&s;t an&s;wered, or &s;o much
as fairly &s;tated, let him then make his
compliments to the Author. But if he
can no more make &s;en&s;e of what this Gen|tleman
has written than I can, he will
need no an&s;wer to it. Nothing is ea&s;ier,
than for a man to tran&s;late or copy, or
compo&s;e a plau&s;ible di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome pages
in technical terms, whereby he &s;hall
make a &s;hew of &s;aying &s;omewhat, although
neither the Reader nor him&s;elf under&s;tand
one Title of it. Whether this be the
ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Walton,</HI> and whether he un|der&s;tands
either Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> or me,
or him&s;elf, (whatever I may think) I &s;hall
not take upon me to &s;ay. But one thing
I know, that many an unmeaning Speech
pa&s;&s;eth for &s;ignificant by the mere a&s;&s;u|rance
<PB N="69" REF="68">
of the Speaker, till he cometh to
be catechi&s;ed upon it; and then the truth
&s;heweth it &s;elf. This Vindicator, indeed,
by his di&s;&s;embling nine parts in ten of the
difficulties propo&s;ed in the Analy&s;t, &s;hew|eth
no inclination to be catechi&s;ed by me.
But his Scholars have a right to be in|formed.
I, therefore, recommend it to
them, not to be impo&s;ed on by hard
words and magi&s;terial a&s;&s;ertions, but care|fully
to pry into his &s;en&s;e, and &s;ift his
meaning, and particularly to in&s;i&s;t on a
di&s;tinct an&s;wer to the following que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="4">IV. LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive velocity without motion, or
motion without exten&s;ion, or exten&s;ion
without magnitude? If he an&s;wers that
he can, let him teach them to do the
&s;ame. If he cannot, let him be asked,
how he reconciles the idea of a Fluxion
which he gives (<HI>P.</HI> 13.) with common
&s;en&s;e? Again, let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the product of nothing
multiplied by &s;omething? And if &s;o, when
the difference between the Gnomon and
the &s;um of the rectangles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vindication, p. 17.</NOTE> vani&s;heth,
whether the rectangles them&s;elves do not
al&s;o vani&s;h? <HI>i. e.</HI> when <HI>a b</HI> is nothing,
whether <HI>A b</HI> &plus; <HI>B a</HI> be not al&s;o nothing?
<PB N="70" REF="69">
<HI>i. e.</HI> whether the momentum of <HI>AB</HI> be not
nothing? Let him then be asked, what his
momentums are good for, when they are thus
brought to nothing. Again, I wi&s;h he
were asked to explain the difference be|tween
a magnitude infinitely &s;mall and a
magnitude infinitely dimini&s;hed. If he &s;aith
there is no difference: Then let him be
further asked how he dares to explain the
method of Fluxions by the <HI>Ratio</HI> of mag|nitudes
infinitely dimini&s;hed (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) when
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> hath expre&s;sly excluded
all con&s;ideration of quantities infinitely
&s;mall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Introduction to his Quadratures.</NOTE>? If this able Vindicator &s;hould &s;ay
that quantities infinitely dimini&s;hed are
nothing at all, and con&s;equently that, ac|cording
to him, the fir&s;t and la&s;t <HI>Ratio</HI>'s
are proportions between nothings, let him
be de&s;ired to make &s;en&s;e of this, or explain
what he means by <HI>proportion between no|things.</HI>
If he &s;hould &s;ay the ultimate pro|portions
are the <HI>Ratio</HI>'s of mere limits, then
let him be asked how the limits of lines
can be proportioned or divided? After all,
who knows but this Gentleman, who hath
already complained of me for an uncom|mon
way of treating Mathematics and Ma|thematicians
(<HI>P.</HI> 5.) may (as well as the
<HI>Cantabrigian</HI>) cry out, <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>In|qui&s;ition,</HI>
when he finds him&s;elf thus clo&s;ely
pur&s;ued and be&s;et with Interrogatories?
<PB N="71" REF="70">
That we may not, therefore, &s;eem too hard
on an innocent man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into difficulties and &s;traits that he
was not aware of, I &s;hall propo&s;e one &s;ingle
expedient, by which his Di&s;ciples (whom
it mo&s;t concerns) may &s;oon &s;atisfy them|&s;elves,
whether this Vindicator really un|der&s;tands
what he takes upon him to vin|dicate.
It is in &s;hort, that they would ask
him to explain the &s;econd, third or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this the
Touch&s;tone of his Vindication. If he can
do it, I &s;hall own my &s;elf much mi&s;taken:
If he cannot, it will be evident that he was
much mi&s;taken in him&s;elf, when he pre|&s;umed
to defend Fluxions without &s;o much
as knowing what they are. So having put
the merits of the cau&s;e on this i&s;&s;ue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars.</P>
