<P>_HOWEVER unwor|thy
the&s;e Scenes

LORDSHIP'S Pro|tection,
the De&s;ign
with which &s;ome of them
<PB REF="3">
were written, cannot fail of
recommending them to ONE
who hath &s;o gloriou&s;ly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
Him&s;elf in the Cau&s;e
of Liberty, to which the Cor|ruption
I have here endea|voured
to expo&s;e, may one Day
be a very fatal Enemy.</P>
<P>The Freedom of the Stage
is, perhaps, as well worth con|tending
for, as that of the
Pre&s;s. It is the Opinion of an
Author well known to Your
LORDSHIP, that Examples
work quicker and &s;tronger on
the Minds of Men than Pre|cepts.</P>
<P>This will, I believe, my
LORD, be found truer with
<PB REF="4">
regard to Politicks than to E|thicks:
The mo&s;t ridiculous
Exhibitions of Luxury or Ava|rice
may likely have little Ef|fect
on the Sen&s;uali&s;t or the
Mi&s;er; but I fan&s;y a lively Re|pre&s;entation
of the Calamities
brought on a Country by ge|neral
Corruption, might have a
very &s;en&s;ible and u&s;eful Effect
on the Spectators.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> who owed his
De&s;truction greatly to the
Contempt brought on him by
the Comedies of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI>
is a la&s;ting In&s;tance of the
Force of Theatrical Ridicule:
Here, indeed, this Weapon
was u&s;ed to an ill Purpo&s;e;
<PB REF="5">
but &s;urely, what is able to
bring Wi&s;dom and Virtue in|to
Di&s;repute, will with great
Facility lay their Oppo&s;ites
under a general Contempt.
There are among us who
&s;eem &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Dan|ger
of Wit and Humour, that
they are re&s;olved to have no|thing
to do with them: And
indeed they are in the right
on't; for Wit, like Hunger,
will be with great Difficulty re|&s;trained
from falling on, where
there is great Plenty and Variety
of Food.</P>
<P>But while the powerful
Sons of Dulne&s;s &s;hed all their
Influence on their inferior Bre|thren,

be You, My LORD, who
are the mo&s;t favourite Offspring

which true Patrioti&s;m (a Word

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Comedy was begun at <HI>Ley|den</HI>
in the Year 1728, and after
it had been sketched out into a few loo&s;e
Scenes, was thrown by, and for a long
while no more thought of. It was origi|nally
writ for my private Amu&s;ement;
as it would indeed have been little le&s;s
than Quixoti&s;m it&s;elf to hope any other
Fruits from attempting Characters wherein
the inimitable <HI>Cervantes</HI> &s;o far excelled.
The Impo&s;&s;ibility of going beyond, and the
extreme Difficulty of keeping pace with him,
were &s;ufficient to infu&s;e De&s;pair into a very
adventurous Author.</P>
<P>I &s;oon di&s;covered too, that my too &s;mall
Experience in, and little Knowledge of the
World, had led me into an Error. I &s;oon
found it infinitely more difficult than I
imagined, to vary the Scene, and give my
<PB REF="9">
Knight an Opportunity of di&s;playing him&s;elf
in a different manner from that wherein he
appears in the Romance. Human Nature
is every where the &s;ame. And the Modes
and Habits of particular Nations do not
change it enough, &s;ufficiently to di&s;tingui&s;h
a <HI>Quixore</HI> in <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>Quixote</HI> in
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e Sentiments Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> concurred with me, who, upon
&s;eeing the afore&s;aid Sketch, both di&s;&s;uaded
me from &s;uffering it to be repre&s;ented on
the Stage; and accordingly it was reman|ded
back to my Shelf, where, probably, it
would have peri&s;hed in Oblivion, had not
the Solicitations of the di&s;tre&s;t Actors in
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI> prevail'd on me to revi&s;e it,
at the &s;ame time that it came into my
Head to add tho&s;e Scenes concerning our
Elections.</P>
<P>Being thus altered, it was often rehear&s;ed
on that Theatre, and a particular Day
appointed for its Action; but the Giant
<HI>Cajanus,</HI> of a Race who were always
<PB REF="10">
Enemies to our poor <HI>Don,</HI> deferred his Ap|pearance
&s;o long, that the Intervention of
the Actor's Benefits would have put it off
till the next Sea&s;on, had I not brought it on
where now it appears.</P>
<P>I have troubled the Reader thus long, to
account for this Comedy's appearing as it
now does, and that he might di&s;tingui&s;h
tho&s;e Parts of it which were the Produc|tion
of this Sea&s;on from tho&s;e which were
written in my more juvenile Years, and be|fore
mo&s;t of the Pieces with which I have
endeavoured to entertain the Publick.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<STAGE>MANAGER, AUTHOR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO Prologue, Sir! The Audience will never bear
it. They will not bate you any thing of their
due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the Audience's very humble Servant;
but they cannot make a Man write a Prologue, whe|ther
he can or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, there is nothing ea&s;ier: I have
known an Author bring three or four to the Hou&s;e
with one Play, and give us our Choice which we
would &s;peak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and I have now three in my Poc|ket,
written by Friends, of which I choo&s;e none &s;hould
be &s;poke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e they have been all &s;poke already twen|ty
times over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee them, pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are written in &s;uch damn'd cramp Hands,
you will never be able to read them; but I will tell
you the Sub&s;tance of them. One of them begins with
abu&s;ing the Writings of all my Cotemporaries, la|menting
the fallen State of the Stage; and la&s;tly, a&s;|&s;uring
the Audience that this Play was written with a
De&s;ign to re&s;tore true Ta&s;te, and their approving it
is the be&s;t Symptom they can give of their having
any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="14">
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and a very good Scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be &s;o; but it hath been the Subject of
almo&s;t every Prologue for the&s;e ten Years la&s;t pa&s;t.
The Second is in a different Ca&s;t: The fir&s;t twelve
Lines inveigh again&s;t all Indecency on the Stage, and
the la&s;t twenty Lines &s;hew you what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would do better for an Epilogue: But
what is the Third?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Third has &s;ome Wit in it, and
would have done very well, but for a Mi&s;take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! What Mi&s;take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Author never read my Play, and
taking it for a regular Comedy of Five Acts, hath fal|len
very &s;everely on Farce: However, it is a pretty
good one, and will do very well for the fir&s;t genteel
Comedy you bring on the Stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't you think a Play, with &s;o odd a
Title as yours, requires to be a little explain'd? May
they not be too much &s;urpris'd at &s;ome things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. The Audience, I believe, are all
acquainted with the Character of <HI>Don Quixote</HI> and
<HI>Sancho.</HI> I have brought them over into <HI>England,</HI> and
introduced them at an Inn in the Country, where, I
believe, no one will be &s;urpris'd that the Knight finds
&s;everal People as mad as him&s;elf. This I could have
told them in forty dull Lines, if I would, but I rather
cho&s;e to let it alone; for, to tell you the Truth, I can
draw but one Conclu&s;ion from the Prologues I have
ever &s;een, that the Authors are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the De|merits
of their Plays, that they de&s;ire to &s;et the Au|dience
a&s;leep before they begin: But of what real U&s;e
is a Bill of Fare to any Entertainment, where the
Gue&s;ts are not left to their Choice what Part they will
pick at, but are oblig'd to &s;wallow the Whole indif|ferently?</P>
</SP>
<PB REF="15">
<STAGE>Enter a Player.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Play.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the Audience make &s;uch a Noi&s;e with
their Canes, that, if we don't begin immediately, they
will beat the Hou&s;e down before the Play begins; and
it is not advi&s;able to put them out of Humour, for
there are two or three of the loude&s;t Cat-calls, in the
Gallery, that ever were heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not frightned at that. Tho&s;e are only
&s;ome particular Friends of mine, who are to put on
the Face of Enemies at fir&s;t, and be converted at the
End of the Fir&s;t Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Order then to play away the Overture imme|diately.
Come, Sir, what do you do with your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Auth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e my &s;elf in &s;ome Part of the
Hou&s;e, where I &s;hall &s;ee, and not be &s;een: And I can
a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, if the Audience are but half as well
entertain'd with this Play, as I &s;hall be my &s;elf, it will
go off with univer&s;al Applau&s;e.</P>

<P>Well, Neighbour, what's your Opinion of this &s;trange

<P>How can that be, Neighbour, they tell me he's a <HI>Spa|niard</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that to us? Let him look to his Qualifications
when we have cho&s;e him. If he can't &s;it in the Hou&s;e, that's
his Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, he can't be cho&s;e if he &s;hould &s;tand; for, to
my certain Knowledge, the Corporation have promis'd Sir <HI>Tho|mas
Loveland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bouncer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pugh! all Promi&s;es are conditional; and let me tell
you, Mr. <HI>Retail,</HI> I begin to &s;moke a Plot. I begin to appre|hend
no Oppo&s;ition, and then we're &s;old, Neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Neighbour; then we &s;hall not be &s;old, and
that's wor&s;e: But rather than it &s;hould come to that, I would
ride all over the Kingdom for a Candidate; and if I thought
Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> intended to &s;teal us in this manner, he &s;hould have
no Vote of mine, I a&s;&s;ure you. I &s;hall vote for no Man who
holds the Corporation cheap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;uppo&s;e we were to go in a Body, and &s;olicit Sir
<HI>Don Quixote</HI> to &s;tand? As for his being mad, while he's out of
<HI>Bedlam</HI> it does not &s;ignify.</P>
</SP>

nothing to do but not to choo&s;e him, and then we may recover

<P>My Neighbour and I have a &s;trange Thought come in|to
our Heads; you know, Mr. <HI>Guzzle,</HI> we are like to have
no Oppo&s;ition, and that I believe you will feel the want of, as
much as any Man. Now, d'ye &s;ee, we have taken it into
Con&s;ideration, whether we &s;hould not ask this Sir <HI>Don</HI> to re|pre&s;ent

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; if either of you will hang out a
Sign and entertain him; but he is far enough in my Books al|ready.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too cautious, Ma&s;ter <HI>Guzzle</HI>; I make no
doubt but he is &s;ome very rich Man, who pretends to be poor
in order to get his Election the cheaper; he can have no other
De&s;ign in &s;taying among us. For my part, I make no doubt
but that he is come to &s;tand on the Court Intere&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, if he &s;tands at all, it is on the Court Side,
no doubt; for he talks of nothing but Kings, and Princes, and
Prince&s;&s;es, and Emperors, and Empre&s;&s;es.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother Alderman, I have reproved you already for
that way of Rea&s;oning; it &s;avours too much of Bribery. I
like an Oppo&s;ition, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e a Man may be oblig'd to
vote again&s;t his Party; therefore when we invite a Gentleman
to &s;tand, we invite him to &s;pend his Money for the Honour of
his Party; and when both Parties have &s;pent as much as they
are able, every hone&s;t Man will vote according to his Con|&s;cience.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Mayor talks like a Man of Sen&s;e and Honour,
and it does me good to hear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>May.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Mr. <HI>Guzzle,</HI> I never gave a Vote contrary to
my Con&s;cience. I have very earne&s;tly recommended the Coun|try-Intere&s;t
to all my Brethren: But before that, I recommend|ed
the Town-Intere&s;t, that is, the Intere&s;t of this Corporation;
and fir&s;t of all I recommended to every particular Man to take
a particular Care of him&s;elf. And it is with a certain way of
Rea&s;oning, That he that &s;erves me be&s;t, will &s;erve the Town

be&s;t.</P>

<P>Your Wor&s;hip may have a Reli&s;h for the&s;e Rewards,

nothing of the&s;e fine things; and for any Reward I have hither|to
got, I had much rather have gone without it. As for an
I&s;land, I believe I could reli&s;h it as well as another; but a Man
may catch cold while his Coat is making: And &s;ince you may
provide for me in a much ea&s;ier way, if I might be &s;o bold as
to &s;peak&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any thing to get an hone&s;t Livelihood, which is more
than I find we are like to do in the way we are going on: For,
if I dur&s;t &s;peak it&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="36">
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak fearle&s;ly.&mdash;I will only impute it to thy Igno|rance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I find, Sir, that we are look'd on here to be,
neither more nor le&s;s, better or wor&s;e, than a couple of Mad|men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quix.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sancho,</HI> I am not concern'd at the evil Opinion of
Men. Indeed, if we con&s;ider who are their Favourites, we
&s;hall have no rea&s;on to be &s;o fond of their Applau&s;e. Virtue,
<HI>Sancho,</HI> is too bright for their Eyes, and they dare not behold
her. Hypocri&s;y is the Deity they wor&s;hip. Is not the Lawyer
often call'd an hone&s;t Man, when for a &s;neaking Fee he pleads
the Villain's Cau&s;e, or attempts to extort Evidence to the Con|viction
of the Innocent? Does not the Phy&s;ician live well in
his Neighbourhood, while he &s;uffers them to bribe his Igno|rance
to their De&s;truction? But why &s;hould I mention tho&s;e
who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion 'tis to prey on others? Look thro' the World,
What is it recommends Men, but the Poverty, the Vice, and
the Mi&s;ery of others? This, <HI>Sancho,</HI> they are &s;en&s;ible of, and
therefore, in&s;tead of endeavouring to make him&s;elf better, each
Man endeavours to make his Neighbour wor&s;e. Each Man ri|&s;es
to Admiration by treading on Mankind. Riches and Power
accrue to the One, by the De&s;truction of Thou&s;ands. The&s;e
are the general Objects of the good Opinion of Men: Nay,
and that which is profe&s;s'd to be paid to Virtue, is &s;eldom more
to any thing than a &s;upercilious Contempt of our Neighbour.
What is a good-natur'd Man? Why, one, who &s;eeing the
Want of his Friend, cries he pities him. Is this real? No:
If it was, he would relieve him. His Pity is triumphant Ar|rogance
and In&s;ult: It ari&s;es from his Pride, not from his
Compa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Sancho,</HI> let them call me mad; I'm not mad e|nough
to court their Approbation.</P>

I; &s;ometimes I think one is Ma&s;ter, and then again I think it is
t'other.&mdash;I am &s;ure I had rather be the Squire, for he &s;leeps
mo&s;t, and eats mo&s;t; he is as bad as a Grayhound in a Hou&s;e;
there is no laying down any thing eatable, but if you turn your
Back, &s;lap, he has it up. As for the Knight, as he calls
him&s;elf, he has more to pay for breaking Windows, than eat|ing:
Wou'd I were well rid of him! He will &s;it you &s;ome|times
in the Yard to guard the Ca&s;tle, as he calls it; but I am

your Daughter for her &s;ake, or your own? If for her's, &s;ure
'tis &s;omething whim&s;ical, to make her mi&s;erable in order to
make her happy. Money is a Thing well worth con&s;idering in
the&s;e Affairs; but Parents always regard it too much, and Lov|ers
too little. No Match can be happy, which Love and For|tune
do not con&s;pire to make &s;o. The greate&s;t Addition of
either, illy &s;upplies the intire Ab&s;ence of the other; nor wou'd
