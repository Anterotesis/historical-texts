<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Analogies between Animals and Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the numberle&s;s objects with which
the &s;urface of this globe is covered and
peopled, animals de&s;ervedly hold the fir&s;t rank,
both on account of the relation they &s;tand in to
man, and of their acknowledged &s;uperiority over
vegetable and inanimated matter. The &s;en&s;es,
the figure, and the motions of animals, be&s;tow
on them a more exten&s;ive connection with &s;ur|rounding
objects than is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by vegetables.
The latter, however, from their expan&s;ion, their
growth, and the variety of parts which compo&s;e
them, are more intimately related to external
objects than minerals or &s;tones, which are per|fectly
inert, and deprived of every vital or active
<PB N="2" REF="5">
principle. It is this number of relations alone
which renders the animal &s;uperior to the vege|table,
and the vegetable to the mineral. Man,
if we e&s;timate him by his material part alone, is
&s;uperior to the brute creation only from the
number of peculiar relations he enjoys by means
of his hand and of his tongue; and, though all
the operations of the Omnipotent are in them|&s;elves
equally perfect, the animated being, ac|cording
to our mode of perception, is the mo&s;t
compleat; and man is the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and
perfect animal.</P>
<P>What a variety of &s;prings, of powers, and of
mechanical movements, are included in that
&s;mall portion of matter of which the body of an
animal is compo&s;ed! What a number of rela|tions,
what harmony, what corre&s;pondence a|mong
the different parts! How many combina|tions,
arrangements, cau&s;es, effects, and prin|ciples,
all con&s;piring to accompli&s;h the &s;ame de|&s;ign!
Of the&s;e, we know nothing but by their
re&s;ults, which are &s;o difficult to comprehend, that
they only cea&s;e to be miraculous from our habits
of inattention and our want of reflection.</P>
<P>But, however admirable this work may ap|pear,
the greate&s;t miracle is not exhibited in the
individual. It is in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive renovation,
and in the continued duration of the &s;pecies,
that Nature a&s;&s;umes an a&s;pect altogether incon|ceivable
and a&s;toni&s;hing. This faculty of repro|duction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word is frequently u&s;ed by the author, and requires to be explained. It &s;ignifies the power of producing or propa|gating in general, and is equally applicable to plants and to animals. Generation is a &s;pecies of reproduction peculiar to animated beings.</NOTE>,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
which is peculiar to animals and ve|getables;
this &s;pecies of unity which always
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and &s;eems to be eternal; this generative
power which is perpetually in action, mu&s;t, with
regard to us, continue to be a my&s;tery &s;o pro|found,
that we &s;hall probably never reach the
bottom of it.</P>
<P>Even inanimated bodies, the &s;tones or the
du&s;t under our feet, have &s;ome properties; their
very exi&s;tence pre&s;uppo&s;es a great number; and
matter, the mo&s;t imperfectly organized, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
many relations with the other parts of the uni|ver&s;e.
We will not a&s;&s;ert, with &s;ome philo|&s;ophers,
that matter, under whatever form it
appears, is con&s;cious of its exi&s;tence and of its
relative powers. This que&s;tion belongs to me|taphy&s;ics,
of which we intend not here to treat.
We &s;hall only remark, that, being ignorant of
the extent of our own connections with exter|nal
objects, we cannot he&s;itate in pronouncing
inanimated matter to be infinitely more ig|norant.
Be&s;ides, our &s;en&s;ations having not the
mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;emblance to the cau&s;es which
produce them, analogy obliges us to conclude,
that dead matter is neither endowed with &s;enti|ment,
with &s;en&s;ation, nor with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of its own exi&s;tence. To attribute any of the&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="7">
faculties to it, therefore, would be a&s;cribing to it
the power of thinking, of acting, and of per|ceiving
nearly in the &s;ame manner as we our|&s;elves
think, act, and perceive; which is equally
repugnant to rea&s;on and to religion.</P>
<P>With inanimated matter, therefore, though
formed of du&s;t and clay, we have no other
relations than what ari&s;e from the general pro|perties
of bodies, namely, exten&s;ion, impene|trability,
gravity, &amp;c. But, as relations purely
material make no internal impre&s;&s;ion on us, and,
as they exi&s;t entirely independent of us, they
cannot be con&s;idered as any part of our being.
Our exi&s;tence, therefore, is an effect of organi|zation,
of life, of the &s;oul. Matter, in this view,
is not a principal, but an acce&s;&s;ory. It is a fo|reign
covering, united to us in a manner un|known;
and its pre&s;ence is noxious. Thought
is the con&s;tituent principle of our being, and is
perhaps totally independent of matter.</P>
<P>We exi&s;t, then, without knowing how; and
we think, without perceiving the rea&s;on of
thought. But, whatever be the mode of our
being, or of our thinking, whether our &s;en&s;a|tions
be real or apparent, their effects are not the
le&s;s certain. The train of our ideas, though dif|ferent
from the objects which occa&s;ion them,
gives ri&s;e to genuine affections, and produces in us
relations to external objects, which we may re|gard
as real, becau&s;e they are uniform and in|variable.
Thus, agreeable to the nature of our
<PB N="5" REF="8">
being, it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt concerning the
reality of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions and re&s;emblances
which we perceive in the bodies that &s;urround
us. We may, therefore, conclude, without he|&s;itation,
that man holds the fir&s;t rank in the or|der
of nature; and that brute animals hold the
&s;econd, vegetables the third, and minerals the
la&s;t. Though we are unable clearly to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
between our animal and &s;piritual qualities;
though the brute creation are endowed with the
&s;ame &s;en&s;es, the &s;ame principles of life and mo|tion,
and perform many actions in a manner &s;i|milar
to tho&s;e of man; yet they have not the
&s;ame extent of relation to external objects; and,
con&s;equently, their re&s;emblance to us fails in
numberle&s;s particulars. We differ &s;till more
from vegetables; but we are more analogous to
them than to minerals; for vegetables po&s;&s;e&s;s a
&s;pecies of animated organization; but minerals
have nothing that approaches to regular organs.</P>
<P>Before we give the hi&s;tory of an animal, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to have an exact knowledge of the ge|neral
order of his peculiar relations, and then to
di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e relations which he has in com|mon
with vegetables and with minerals. An
animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nothing common to the mineral,
but the general properties of matter: His na|ture
and oeconomy, however, are perfectly dif|ferent.
The mineral is inactive, in&s;en&s;ible, &s;ub|ject
to every impul&s;e, without organization, or
the power of reproduction, a rude ma&s;s, fitted
only to be trode by the feet of men and of ani|mals.
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Even the mo&s;t precious metals, which
derive their value only from the conventions of
men, are regarded in no other light by the phi|lo&s;opher.
In the animal, the whole powers of
nature are united. The principles with which
he is animated are peculiar to him: He wills;
he determines; he acts; he communicates, by
his &s;en&s;es, with the mo&s;t di&s;tant objects; his
body is a world in miniature, a central point to
which every thing in the univer&s;e is connected.
The&s;e are his peculiar and invariable relations:
The faculties of growth and developement, of
reproduction and the multiplication of his &s;pe|cies,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with the vegetable
kingdom.</P>
<P>Progre&s;&s;ive motion appears to be the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hing quality between an animal and a
vegetable. We, indeed, know no vegetable
that enjoys a progre&s;&s;ive motion. But this mo|tion
is denied to &s;everal &s;pecies of animals, as
oy&s;ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not &s;trictly true; for oy&s;ters, and even gall-in&s;ects, are capable of a degree of progre&s;&s;ive motion.</NOTE>, gall-in&s;ects, &amp;c. This di&s;tinction, there|fore,
is neither general nor e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ation more e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hes ani|mals
from vegetables. But <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> is a com|plex
idea, and requires &s;ome explication; for,
if &s;en&s;ation implied no more than motion con&s;e|quent
upon a &s;troke or an impul&s;e, the &s;en&s;itive
plant enjoys this power. But, if by &s;en&s;ation
we mean the faculty of perceiving and of com|paring
ideas, it is uncertain whether brute ani|mals
<PB N="7" REF="10">
are endowed with it. If it &s;hould be al|lowed
to dogs, elephants, &amp;c. who&s;e actions
&s;eem to proceed from motives &s;imilar to tho&s;e
by which men are actuated, it mu&s;t be denied
to many &s;pecies of animals, particularly to tho&s;e
that appear not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculty of progre&s;|&s;ive
motion. If the &s;en&s;ation of an oy&s;ter, for
example, differed only in degree from that of a
dog, why do we not a&s;cribe the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation
to vegetables, though in a degree &s;till inferior?
This di&s;tinction, therefore, between the animal
and vegetable, is neither &s;ufficiently general nor
determined.</P>
<P>A third di&s;tinction has been derived from the
manner of feeding. Animals have organs of
apprehen&s;ion by which they lay hold of their
food; they &s;earch for pa&s;ture, and have a choice
in their aliment. But plants are under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of receiving &s;uch nouri&s;hment as the &s;oil
affords them, without exerting any choice in the
&s;pecies of their food, or in the manner of ac|quiring
it: The moi&s;ture of the earth is the on|ly
&s;ource of their nouri&s;hment. However, if
we attend to the organization and action of the
roots and leaves, we &s;hall &s;oon be convinced,
that the&s;e are the external organs by which ve|getables
are enabled to extract their food; that
the roots turn a&s;ide from a vein of bad earth, or
from any ob&s;tacle which they meet with, in
&s;earch of a better &s;oil; and that they &s;plit and
&s;eparate their &s;ibres in different directions, and
<PB N="8" REF="11">
even change their form, in order to procure
nouri&s;hment to the plant. A general di&s;tinction,
therefore, between the animal and vegetable,
cannot be founded on their manner of feeding.</P>
<P>From this inve&s;tigation we are led to conclude,
that there is no ab&s;olute and e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction
between the animal and vegetable kingdoms;
but that nature proceeds by imperceptible degrees
from the mo&s;t perfect to the mo&s;t imperfect ani|mal,
and from that to the vegetable: Hence the
fre&s;h water polypus may be regarded as the la&s;t
of animals, and the fir&s;t of plants.</P>
<P>After examining the di&s;tinctions, we &s;hall now
inquire into the re&s;emblances which take place
betwee animals and vegetables. The power of
reproduction is common to the two kingdoms,
and is a re&s;emblance both univer&s;al and e&s;&s;ential.
This mutual faculty would induce us to think
that animals and vegetables are beings of the &s;ame
order.</P>
<P>A &s;econd re&s;emblance may be derived from
the expan&s;ion of their parts, which is likewi&s;e a
common property; for vegetables grow as well
as animals; and, though &s;ome difference in the
manner of expan&s;ion may be remarked, it is nei|ther
general nor e&s;&s;ential; &s;ince the growth of
&s;ome con&s;iderable parts of animals, as the bones,
the hairs, the nails, the horns, &amp;c. is the effect
of a genuine vegetation; and the foetus, in its
fir&s;t formation, may be rather &s;aid to vegetate
than to live.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12">
A third re&s;emblance ari&s;es from the following
fact: Some animals are propagated in the &s;ame
manner, and by the &s;ame means, as vegetables.
The multiplication of the vine-fretter, (<HI>puceron</HI>),
which is effected without copulation, is &s;imilar to
that of plants by &s;eed; and the multiplication of
the polypus by cutting re&s;embles that of plants
by &s;lips.</P>
<P>We may now conclude, therefore, with more
certainty, that animals and vegetables are beings
of the &s;ame order, and that Nature pa&s;&s;es from
the one to the other by imperceptible degrees;
&s;ince the properties in which they re&s;emble each
other are univer&s;al and e&s;&s;ential, while tho&s;e by
which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed are limited and par|ticular.</P>
<P>Let us next proceed to compare animals and
vegetables in different points of view; for ex|ample,
with regard to number, &s;ituation, mag|nitude,
figure, &amp;c. from which new inductions
will ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Animals exceed plants in the number of &s;pe|cies.
In the cla&s;s of in&s;ects alone, there are,
perhaps, a greater number of &s;pecies, than of the
whole &s;pecies of plants on the face of the earth.
Animals differ from each other much more than
plants: It is the great &s;imilarity of plants that
has given ri&s;e to the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;hing
and arranging them, and to the variety of bo|tanical
&s;y&s;tems, which are much more numerous
than tho&s;e of zoology.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
Be&s;ide being more &s;trongly characteri&s;ed, e|very
&s;pecies of animal is di&s;tingui&s;hable from
another by copulation. Tho&s;e may be regarded
as of the &s;ame &s;pecies which, by copulation, u|niformly
produce and perpetuate beings every
way &s;imilar to their parents; and tho&s;e which,
by the &s;ame means, either produce nothing, or
di&s;&s;imilar beings, may be con&s;idered as of diffe|rent
&s;pecies. A fox, for example, will be of a
different &s;pecies from a dog, if nothing re&s;ults
from the intercour&s;e of a male and a female of
the&s;e two animals; or, if the re&s;ult be a di&s;&s;imilar
creature, a kind of mule, as this mule cannot
multiply, it will be a &s;ufficient demon&s;tration
that the fox and dog are different &s;pecies of ani|mals.
In plants we have not the &s;ame advan|tage;
for, though &s;exes have been attributed to
them, and generic di&s;tinctions have been found|ed
on the parts of fructification; yet, as the&s;e
characteri&s;tics are neither &s;o certain nor &s;o ap|parent
as in animals; and, as the reproduction
of plants can be accompli&s;hed by &s;everal methods
which have no dependence on &s;exes, or the parts
of fructification, this opinion has not been &s;uc|ce&s;sful;
and it is only by the mi&s;application of
an analogy, that the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem has been
pretended to be &s;ufficient to enable us to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the different &s;pecies of the vegetable king|dom.</P>
<P>Though the &s;pecies of animals be more nume|rous
than tho&s;e of plants, the number of indi|viduals
<PB N="11" REF="14">
in each &s;pecies of the latter far exceed
tho&s;e of the former. In animals, as well as in
plants, the number of individuals is much great|er
in the &s;mall than in the large kinds. Flies
are infinitely more numerous than elephants;
and there are more herbs than trees. But, if we
compare the quantity of individuals in each &s;pe|cies,
the number of the plant far exceeds that of
the animal. Quadrupeds, for example, produce
but few at a time, and at con&s;iderable intervals.
Trees, on the contrary, produce annually an a|mazing
quantity of &s;eeds. It may be alledged,
that, to render this compari&s;on exact, the quan|tity
of &s;eeds produced by a tree &s;hould be com|pared
with the quantity of germs contained in
the &s;emen of an animal; and then, perhaps, it
would appear, that animals abound more in
germs than vegetables. But, by collecting and
&s;owing the &s;eeds of a &s;ingle elm tree, 100,000
young elms may be rai&s;ed from the product of
one year. Though a hor&s;e, however, were fur|ni&s;hed
with all the mares he could cover in a
year, the re&s;ult between the production of the
animal and of the plant would be very different.
I avoid taking notice of the quantity of germs;
becau&s;e of the&s;e, e&s;pecially in the animal, we
have no certain knowledge, and becau&s;e the &s;ame
&s;eminal germs may exi&s;t in the vegetable; for
the &s;eed of a plant is not a germ, but a produc|tion
as perfect as the foetus of an animal, and
<PB N="12" REF="15">
which, like a foetus, requires only the expan&s;ion
of its parts.</P>
<P>To this may be oppo&s;ed the prodigious mul|tiplication
of &s;ome kinds of in&s;ects, as the bee,
a &s;ingle female of which will produce 30 or 40
thou&s;and. But, it ought to be remarked, that
I am here &s;peaking in general of animals com|pared
with vegetables. Be&s;ides, the bee, which
affords, perhaps, an example of the greate&s;t
multiplication among animals, proves nothing a|gain&s;t
the pre&s;ent doctrine; for, out of 30 or
40 thou&s;and flies produced by the mother-bee,
there are but very few females, 1500 or 2000
males; and all the re&s;t are of neither &s;ex, and to|tally
incapable of procreating.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that &s;ome &s;pecies of
in&s;ects, fi&s;hes, and &s;hell-animals, appear to be
extremely prolific. Oy&s;ters, herrings, fleas, &amp;c.
are perhaps equally fertile as mo&s;&s;es, and the
mo&s;t common plants. But, in general, mo&s;t
&s;pecies of animals are le&s;s prolific than plants;
and, upon comparing the multiplication of the
different &s;pecies of plants, we find not &s;uch re|markable
differences, with regard to number, as
take place among animals. Some animals pro|duce
great numbers, and others very few. But,
in every &s;pecies of plants, the quantity produced
is always great.</P>
<P>From what we have already ob&s;erved, it ap|pears,
that, both in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms, the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;pecies are the mo&s;t prolific. In proportion as
animals &s;eem to be more perfect, the number of
individuals decrea&s;es. Does the production of
particular forms of body, nece&s;&s;ary for the per|fecting
of &s;entiment, as tho&s;e of quadrupeds, and
of birds, co&s;t nature more expence of organic
particles than the production of inferior crea|tures?</P>
<P>Let us now compare animals and vegetables
with regard to &s;ituation, &s;ize, and figure. Ve|getables
can exi&s;t no where but on the earth.
Mo&s;t of them are attached to the &s;oil by roots:
Some, as truffles, are entirely covered with the
&s;oil; and a few grow under water. But the
whole require a connection with the &s;urface of
the earth. Animals, on the contrary, are more
generally diffu&s;ed. Some inhabit the &s;urface, and
others the interior parts of the earth. Some ne|ver
ri&s;e above the bottom of the ocean, and o|thers
&s;wim in the waters. The air, the internal
parts of plants, the bodies of men and of other
animals, and even &s;tones them&s;elves, are &s;tored
with inhabitants.</P>
<P>By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope, many new
&s;pecies of animals have been di&s;covered. But,
what is &s;ingular, we are not indebted to this in|&s;trument
for above one or two &s;pecies of plants.
The &s;mall mo&s;s, of which mouldine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts,
is perhaps the only micro&s;copic plant which has
been de&s;cribed. From this it would appear, that
Nature has refu&s;ed exi&s;tence to very &s;mall plants,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
while &s;he has created animalcules in the greate&s;t
profu&s;ion. But this opinion &s;hould not be a|dopted
without examination. Plants are &s;o &s;i|milar
in their &s;tructure, that it is much more
difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them than animals. This
mouldine&s;s, which we imagine to be only a very
&s;mall mo&s;s, may be a fore&s;t or a garden con&s;i&s;t|ing
of a multitude of different plants, though
we are unable to di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>Animals and vegetables differ al&s;o with regard
to &s;ize. There is a greater di&s;proportion between
the bulk of a whale and that of one of the&s;e pre|tended
micro&s;copic animals, than between the
large&s;t oak and the &s;mall mo&s;s mentioned above.
Though bulk be only a relative attribute, it may
be u&s;eful to know the limits within which na|ture
has confined her productions. As to large|ne&s;s,
plants differ but little from animals. The
quantity of matter in a whale and in a large tree
is nearly equal; but, as to &s;mallne&s;s, &s;ome men
have pretended to have &s;een animals &s;o extreme|ly
minute, that a million of them collected in a
heap, would not equal the &s;mall mo&s;s on a piece
of mouldy bread.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t general and mo&s;t obvious di&s;tinc|tion
between plants and animals ari&s;es from their
figure. The form of animals, though infinitely
various, has no re&s;emblance to that of plants:
And, though the polypi, which, like plants, can
be multiplied by cuttings, may be regarded as
the link which connects the animal and vege|table
<PB N="15" REF="18">
kingdoms, not only from the manner of
their reproduction, but &s;till more from their fi|gure;
yet there is no danger of mi&s;taking the
one for the other. The operations of &s;ome ani|mals
re&s;emble plants or flowers. But plants ne|ver
produce any thing &s;imilar to an animal; and
tho&s;e wonderful in&s;ects which make corals,
would never have been mi&s;taken for flowers, if,
by a fooli&s;h prejudice, coral had not been re|garded
as a plant. Thus the errors we may
commit in comparing plants and animals, are
confined to a few objects which lie on the ex|tremities
of the two kingdoms; and the farther
we extend our ob&s;ervations, we &s;hall be the more
convinced, that the Creator has in&s;tituted no
fixed limits between the animal and vegetable;
that the&s;e two &s;pecies of organized beings po&s;|&s;e&s;s
a greater number of common properties
than of real differences; that the production of
an animal requires, perhaps, a &s;maller exertion
of Nature than the production of a vegetable; or
rather, that the production of organized bodies
requires no immediate exertion at all; and,
la&s;tly, that animation, or the principle of life,
in&s;tead of a metaphy&s;ical &s;tep in the &s;cale of be|ing,
is a phy&s;ical property common to all
matter.</P>

<P>WE &s;hall now more clo&s;ely examine this

<P>The fir&s;t, and apparently the mo&s;t &s;imple me|thod,
is to a&s;&s;emble in one body an infinite num|ber
of &s;imilar organic bodies, and to compo&s;e its

It means no more than that the bodies of animals and of vegetables are compo&s;ed of an infinite number of or|ganic particles, perfectly &s;imilar, both in figure and &s;ub&s;tance, to the whole animal or plant, of which they are the con&s;tituent parts.</NOTE>.
<PB N="17" REF="20">
This apparatus appears, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to &s;uppo&s;e
a profu&s;ion of expence. Such magnificence,
however, is not uncommon in Nature. It is di&s;|cernible
even in the more common and inferior
&s;pecies, as in worms, polypi, elms, willows,
and many other plants and in&s;ects, every part of
which contains a whole, and, in order to become
a plant or an in&s;ect, requires only to be unfold|ed
or expanded. Con&s;idering organized bodies
under this point of view, an individual is a
whole uniformly con&s;tructed in all parts, a col|lection
of an infinite number of particles every

which is compo&s;ed of an infinite number of mi|nute

the whole body. And, as the accumulation
perhaps of millions of cubes are nece&s;&s;ary to the
<PB N="19" REF="22">
formation of a &s;ingle grain of &s;ea-&s;alt that is per|ceptible
by our &s;en&s;es, an equal number of &s;imi|lar
organic particles are requi&s;ite to produce one
of tho&s;e numberle&s;s germs contained in an elm,
or in a polypus. A cube of &s;ea-&s;alt mu&s;t be di&s;|&s;olved
before we can di&s;cover, by means of
cry&s;tallization, the minute cubes of which it is
compo&s;ed: In the &s;ame manner, the parts of an
elm or of a polypus mu&s;t be &s;eparated, before we
can recogni&s;e, by means of vegetation, or ex|pan&s;ion,
the &s;mall elms or polypi contained in
the different parts of the&s;e bodies.</P>
<P>The difficulty of a&s;&s;enting to this idea proceeds
from the well known prejudice, that we can on|ly
judge of the compound by the &s;imple;
that, to di&s;cover the organic &s;tructure of any
being, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be reduced to its &s;imple and
unorganic parts; and that hence it is more ea&s;y
to conceive how a cube mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be com|po&s;ed
of other cubes, than how a polypus can
be compo&s;ed of other polypi. But, if we ex|amine
attentively what is meaned by &s;imple and
compound, we &s;hall find, that in this, as in every
thing el&s;e, the plan of Nature is very different
from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and imperfection of our con|ceptions.</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;es, it is well known, convey not to
us exact repre&s;entations of external objects.
When we want to calculate, to judge, to com|pare,
to weigh, to mea&s;ure, &amp;c. we are obliged
to have recour&s;e to foreign aid, to rules, to prin|ciples,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
to u&s;ages, to in&s;truments, &amp;c. All the&s;e
adminicles are efforts of human genius, and be|long
more or le&s;s to the ab&s;traction of our ideas.
This ab&s;traction, with regard to us, con&s;titutes
the &s;implicity of things; and the difficulty of re|ducing
them to this ab&s;traction is the compound.
Exten&s;ion, for example, being a general and ab|&s;tract
property of matter, is not much com|pounded.
In order, however, to judge concern|ing
it, we have imagined &s;ome exten&s;ions to
have no thickne&s;s, others to have neither thick|ne&s;s
nor breadth, and points, which are exten|&s;ions
without being extended. All the&s;e ab&s;trac|tions
have been invented as &s;upports to the un|der&s;tanding;
and the few definitions employed
in geometry have given ri&s;e to numberle&s;s pre|judices
and fal&s;e conceptions. Whatever is re|ducible
under any of the&s;e definitions is called
&s;imple; and &s;uch things as cannot be ea&s;ily re|duced
to this &s;tandard are con&s;idered as complex.
Thus, a triangle, a &s;quare, a circle, a cube, and
all tho&s;e curves of which we know the geome|trical
properties, are regarded as &s;imple. But
every thing which we cannot reduce under the&s;e
&s;igures, or ab&s;tract rules, appears to us to be com|plex.
We never reflect, that all the&s;e geometri|cal
&s;igures exi&s;t no where but in our own ima|ginations,
or that, if they are ever found in Na|ture,
it is only becau&s;e &s;he exhibits every po&s;|&s;ible
form; and the appearance of &s;imple figures,
as an exact cube, or an equilateral pyramid, is,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
perhaps, more difficult and rare to be found in
nature, than the complex forms of plants or of
animals. It is in this manner that we perpetu|ally
con&s;ider the ab&s;tract as &s;imple, and the real
as complex. But, in nature, no ab&s;tract exi&s;ts;
nothing is &s;imple; every object is compounded.
We are unable to penetrate into the intimate
&s;tructure of bodies. We cannot, therefore, de|termine
what objects are more or le&s;s complex,
unle&s;s by the greater or le&s;s relation they have
to our&s;elves, and to the re&s;t of the univer&s;e. For
this rea&s;on, we regard the animal as being more
complex than the vegetable, and the vegetable
than the mineral. With re&s;pect to us, this no|tion
is ju&s;t; but we know not whether the ani|mal,
vegetable, or mineral, be, in reality, the mo&s;t
complex or the mo&s;t &s;imple; and we are igno|rant
whether the production of a globe or a
cube requires a greater effort of Nature than that
of a germ, or an organic particle. If we were
to indulge in conjectures upon this &s;ubject, we
might imagine the mo&s;t common and mo&s;t nu|merous
objects to be the mo&s;t &s;imple. But this
would make animals more &s;imple than plants or
minerals, becau&s;e the former exceed the latter in
number of &s;pecies.</P>
<P>But, without dwelling longer on this &s;ubject,
it is &s;ufficient to have &s;hown, that all our no|tions
concerning &s;imple and compound are ab|&s;tract
ideas; that they cannot be applied to the
complex operations of nature; that, when we
<PB N="22" REF="25">
attempt to reduce all bodies into elements of a
cubical, pri&s;matic, globular, or any other regular
figure, we &s;ub&s;titute our own imaginations in
oppo&s;ition to real exi&s;tences; and that the forms
of the con&s;tituent particles of different bodies
are ab&s;olutely unknown to us; and, of cour&s;e, we
may believe or &s;uppo&s;e that organized beings
are compo&s;ed of &s;imilar organic particles, as well
as that a cube con&s;i&s;ts of other cubes. We have
no other method of judging but by experience.
We know that a cube of &s;ea-&s;alt is compo&s;ed
of many le&s;&s;er cubes, and that an elm con&s;i&s;ts of
a great number of minute elms; becau&s;e, if we
take a piece of a branch, of a root, of the wood
&s;eparated from the trunk, or a &s;eed, from all
the&s;e a new tree is produced. The polypus,
and &s;ome other &s;pecies of animals, may likewi&s;e
be multiplied by cuttings &s;eparated from any
part of their bodies; and, as our rule of judging
in both ca&s;es is the &s;ame, why &s;hould we form
a different opinion concerning them?</P>
<P>The above rea&s;oning renders it extremely
probable, that there really exi&s;ts in nature an
infinite number of &s;mall organized beings, every
way &s;imilar to tho&s;e large organized bodies
which make &s;uch a con&s;picuous figure in this
world; that the&s;e &s;mall organized beings are
compo&s;ed of living organic particles, which are
common both to animals and vegetables, and are
their primary and incorruptible elements; that
an a&s;&s;emblage of the&s;e particles con&s;titutes an
<PB N="23" REF="26">
animal or a plant; and, con&s;equently, that re|production
or generation is nothing but a change
of form, effected &s;olely by the addition of &s;imi|lar
particles; and the death, or re&s;olution of
organized bodies, is only a &s;eparation of the
&s;ame particles. Of the truth of this doctrine,
not a doubt will remain, after the proofs de|livered
in the following chapters are peru&s;ed.
Be&s;ides, if we reflect on the growth of trees, and
con&s;ider what an immen&s;e ma&s;s is produced from
&s;o &s;mall an origin, we mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that this
increa&s;e of matter is effected by the &s;imple addi|tion
of organic particles which are &s;imilar to one
another, and to the whole. The &s;eed fir&s;t pro|duces
a &s;mall tree, which it contains in minia|ture
within its coats. At the top of this &s;mall
tree a bud is formed, which contains the tree
that is to &s;pring the next &s;ea&s;on; and this bud
is an organized body &s;imilar to the &s;mall tree of
the preceding year. The &s;mall tree of the &s;e|cond
year, in the &s;ame manner, produces a bud
which contains a tree for the third year; and
this proce&s;s uniformly goes on as long as the
tree continues to vegetate: Buds are likewi&s;e
formed at the extremity of each branch, which
contain, in miniature, trees &s;imilar to that of the
fir&s;t year. It is evident, therefore, that trees are
compo&s;ed of minute organized bodies &s;imilar to
them&s;elves, and that the whole individual is
formed by a numerous a&s;&s;emblage of minute and
&s;imilar individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
But, it may be demanded, were not all the&s;e
minute, and &s;imilarly organized bodies, contain|ed
in the &s;eed? and may not the order of their
unfolding be traced from that &s;ource? for it is
apparent, that the fir&s;t bud was &s;urmounted by
a &s;imilar bud, which was not expanded till the
&s;econd year, and the third bud was not unfold|ed
till the third year; and, con&s;equently, the &s;eed
may be &s;aid to have really contained the whole
buds which would be formed for 100 years, or
till the di&s;&s;olution of the plant: It is al&s;o appa|rent,
that this &s;eed contained not only all the
&s;mall organized bodies which mu&s;t in time have
con&s;tituted the individual tree it&s;elf, but like|wi&s;e
all the &s;eeds, and all the individuals which
would &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;e, till the final de&s;truction
of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This, indeed, is a capital difficulty; and we
&s;hall therefore examine it with the greater at|tention.
It is true, that the &s;eed produced a
&s;mall tree the fir&s;t year, &s;olely by the unfolding
of the bud or germ which it contained, and that
this &s;mall tree exi&s;ted in miniature in the bud.
But it is not equally certain that the bud of the
&s;econd year, and tho&s;e of the &s;ucceeding years,
nor that all the &s;mall organic bodies, and the
&s;eeds which mu&s;t have been formed till the end
of the world, or the de&s;truction of the &s;pecies,
were contained in the fir&s;t &s;eed. This opinion
&s;uppo&s;es an infinite progre&s;&s;ion, and makes every
individual a &s;ource of eternal generations. The
<PB N="25" REF="28">
fir&s;t &s;eed, for in&s;tance, mu&s;t have included all
the plants of its &s;pecies which have exi&s;ted, or
ever will exi&s;t; and the fir&s;t man mu&s;t have
contained in his loins all the men who have ap|peared,
or will appear, on the face of the earth.
Every &s;eed, and every animal, according to this
doctrine, mu&s;t have included in its own body an
infinite po&s;terity. If we yield to rea&s;onings of
this kind, we mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;ight of truth in the
labyringths of infinity; and, in place of &s;olving,
or of throwing light upon the que&s;tion, we will
involve it in tenfold ob&s;curity. It is removing
the object beyond the reach of our vi&s;ion, and
then complaining that we cannot &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Let us inve&s;tigate the nature of the ideas of
infinite progre&s;&s;ion and expan&s;ion. How do we
acquire them? In what do they in&s;truct us? We
derive the idea of infinity from the idea of what
is limited. It is in this manner we obtain the
ideas of infinite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and geometrical infi|nity:
Every individual is a unit; &s;everal indivi|duals
make a limited number; and a whole &s;pe|cies
is to us an infinite multitude. From the
&s;ame data which we have demon&s;trated the non|entity
of geometrical infinity, we might prove,
that infinite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or propagation, re&s;ts on
no firmer ba&s;is; that it is only an ab&s;tract idea,
a mere deduction from the idea of finite objects,
by lopping off the limits which nece&s;&s;arily ter|minate
every magnitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this fully demon&s;trated in my preface to the French tran&s;lation of Newton's fluxions, p. 7.</NOTE>; and, of cour&s;e, that
<PB N="26" REF="29">
every opinion which infallibly leads to the idea
of actual exi&s;tence, upon no better authority
than what is derived from geometrical or nume|rical
infinity, ought to be rejected.</P>
<P>The partizans of this opinion are now redu|ced
to the nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging, that
their infinity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and of multiplica|tion
is only an indeterminable or indefinite
number. But, &s;ay they, the fir&s;t &s;eed, of an
elm for example, which weighs not a grain,
actually contains all the organic particles requi|&s;ite
for the formation of this tree, and of all the
individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies which &s;hall ever
appear. Is this a &s;olution of the difficulty? Is
it not cutting the knot, in place of untying it?</P>
<P>When, is reply to the que&s;tion, how beings
are multiplied? it is an&s;wered, that the multi|plication
was compleated in the creation of the
fir&s;t individuals, is not this both an acknow|ledgment
of ignorance, and a renouncing of all
de&s;ire of farther improvement? We a&s;k how
one being produces its like? and we receive for
an&s;wer, that the whole was created at once. A
&s;trange &s;olution; for, whether only one or a
thou&s;and generations had pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;ame diffi|culty
remains, and, in&s;tead of removing it, the
&s;uppo&s;ition of an indefinite number of germs, all
exi&s;ting and contained in a &s;ingle germ, increa|&s;es
and renders it altogether incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>I allow, that it is much ea&s;ier to find fault,
than to inve&s;tigate truth, and that the que&s;tion
<PB N="27" REF="30">
concerning reproduction is perhaps of &s;uch a
&s;ubtile nature, as not to admit of a full and &s;atis|factory
explication. But we ought at lea&s;t to
inquire whether it be altogether in&s;crutable; and,
in the cour&s;e of this inquiry, we will di&s;cover all
that can be known, and the rea&s;on why we can
know no more.</P>
<P>Que&s;tions or inquiries are of two kinds; the
fir&s;t regard primary cau&s;es, the other particular
effects. If, for example, it be a&s;ked why mat|ter
is impenetrable? we mu&s;t either return no
an&s;wer, or reply by &s;aying, that matter is
impenetrable, becau&s;e it is impenetrable. The
&s;ame an&s;wer mu&s;t be made, if we inquire
into the cau&s;e of gravity, of exten&s;ion, of the
inertia of bodies, or of any general quality of
matter. Such is the nature of all general and
ab&s;tract qualities, that, having no mode of com|paring
them with other objects in which they
do not exi&s;t, we are totally incapable of rea&s;on|ing
concerning them; and therefore all inqui|ries
of this kind, being beyond the powers of
human intellect, are perfectly u&s;ele&s;&s;s.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, if the rea&s;on of par|ticular
effects be demanded, we are always in a
condition to give a di&s;tinct an&s;wer, whenever we
can &s;how that the&s;e effects are produced by one
of the general cau&s;es; and the que&s;tion is equal|ly
&s;olved, whether the particular effect proceeds
immediately from a general cau&s;e, or from a
<PB N="28" REF="31">
chain of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive effects, provided we have a
clear conception of the dependence of the&s;e ef|fects
upon each other, and of their mutual rela|tions.</P>
<P>But, when a particular effect appears not to
have any dependence upon more general effects,
or has no analogy to effects already known, we
are then totally unable to give any explication
of it; becau&s;e we have no &s;imilar object with
which it can be compared. We cannot explain
a general cau&s;e, becau&s;e it equally exi&s;ts in every
object; and, on the contrary, we can give no
account of a &s;ingular or i&s;olated effect; becau&s;e
the &s;ame qualities exi&s;t not in any other &s;ubject.
To explain a general cau&s;e, we mu&s;t di&s;cover one
&s;till more general; but a &s;ingular and detached
effect may be illu&s;trated by the di&s;covery of an
analogous effect, which experience or accident
may exhibit.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another kind of que&s;tion, which
may be called a que&s;tion of fact. For example,
why do trees, dogs, &amp;c. exi&s;t? All que&s;tions of
this kind are perfectly in&s;oluble; for tho&s;e who
&s;olve them by final cau&s;es con&s;ider not that they
mi&s;take the effect for the cau&s;e: The relation of
particular objects to our&s;elves has no connection
with their origin. Moral affinity or fitne&s;s can
never become a phy&s;ical rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Que&s;tions in which we employ the word <HI>Why,</HI>
ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="32">
in which we employ <HI>How,</HI> and &s;till more from
tho&s;e in which we ought to u&s;e the words <HI>how
much</HI> or <HI>how many. Why</HI> always relates to the
cau&s;e of the effect, or to the effect it&s;elf; <HI>how</HI> re|lates
to the manner in which the effect happens;
and <HI>how much</HI> relates to the mea&s;ure or quantity
of the effect.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tinctions being e&s;tabli&s;hed, let us now
examine the que&s;tion concerning the reproduc|tion
of beings. If it be demanded <HI>why</HI> animals
and vegetables continue their &s;pecies? we clear|ly
perceive that this is a que&s;tion of fact, and
therefore that it is u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;olvable. But,
if it be a&s;ked <HI>how</HI> animals and vegetables are re|produced?
we are enabled to &s;olve the que&s;tion,
by giving the hi&s;tory of the generation of every
&s;pecies of animal, and of the reproduction of e|very
&s;pecies of plant: After tracing, however,
every po&s;&s;ible method of propagation, and ma|king
the mo&s;t exact ob&s;ervations, we have only
learned the facts; but have not di&s;covered the
cau&s;es: And, as the means Nature employs in
multiplying and continuing the &s;pecies, &s;eem to
have no relation to the effects produced, we are
&s;till under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king, by what &s;ecret
cau&s;e &s;he enables beings to propagate their
kinds?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion is very different from the fir&s;t
and &s;econd. It admits of nice &s;crutiny, and e|ven
allows us to employ the powers of imagina|tion.
It is, therefore, by no means in&s;olvable;
<PB N="30" REF="33">
for it belongs not to a general cau&s;e. Neither
is it &s;olely a que&s;tion of fact: And, if we can
conceive a method of reproduction, depending
on primary cau&s;es, or which, at lea&s;t, is not re|pugnant
to them, we ought to be &s;atisfied with
it; and the more relation it has to the other ef|fects
of Nature, it will re&s;t upon a firmer ba&s;is.</P>
<P>By the nature of the que&s;tion, then, we are
permitted to form hypothe&s;es, and to chu&s;e that
which appears to have the greate&s;t analogy to the
other phaenomena of nature. But we ought to
reject every hypothe&s;is which &s;uppo&s;es the thing
to be already accompli&s;hed, &s;uch, for example,
as that which &s;uppo&s;es the fir&s;t germ to contain
all the germs of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or that every
reproduction is a new creation, an immediate
effect of the will of the Deity; for all hypo|the&s;es
of this kind are mere matters of fact, con|cerning
which it is impo&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on. We
mu&s;t likewi&s;e reject every hypothe&s;is which is
founded on final cau&s;es, &s;uch as, that reproduc|tion
is ordained in order to replace the living
for the dead; that the earth may always be co|vered
with vegetables and peopled with animals;
that men may be &s;upplied with abundance of
nouri&s;hment, &amp;c.; for &s;uch hypothe&s;es, in place
of explaining the effect by phy&s;ical cau&s;es, &s;tand
on no other foundation than arbitrary relations
and moral affinities. We ought, at the &s;ame
time, to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e general axioms and phy|&s;ical
problems &s;o frequently and &s;o injudiciou&s;|ly
<PB N="31" REF="34">
employed as principles by &s;ome philo&s;ophers,
&s;uch as, `Nulla foecundatio extra corpus;' e|very
living creature proceeds from an egg; ge|neration
always &s;uppo&s;es &s;exes, &amp;c. The&s;e max|ims
mu&s;t not be taken in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e; they
&s;ignify no more than that the thing happens
more commonly in this manner than in any o|ther.</P>
<P>Let us, then, endeavour to find an hypothe&s;is
that will be liable to none of the&s;e defects or in|cumbrances;
and, if we &s;hall not &s;ucceed in ex|plaining
the mechani&s;m employed by Nature for
the reproduction of beings, we &s;hall, at lea&s;t, be
able to approach nearer to the truth than we
have hitherto arrived.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner as we make moulds by
which we can be&s;tow on the external parts of
bodies whatever figure we plea&s;e, let us &s;uppo&s;e,
that Nature can form moulds by which &s;he
be&s;tows on bodies both an external and internal
figure; would not this be one method by which
reproduction might be effected?</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider whether this &s;uppo&s;ition
be well founded; let us examine whether it
contains any thing that is ab&s;urd or contradic|tory;
and then we &s;hall di&s;cover what con&s;e|quences
may be drawn from it. Though our
&s;en&s;es reach not beyond the external parts of
bodies, we have clear ideas of their different &s;i|gures
and external affections, and we can imi|tate
Nature, by repre&s;enting external figures in
<PB N="32" REF="35">
different ways, as by painting, by &s;culpture, and
by moulds. But, though our &s;en&s;es be limited
to external qualities, we know that bodies po&s;|&s;e&s;s
internal qualities, &s;ome of which are general,
as gravity. This quality or power acts not in
proportion to the &s;urfaces, but to the ma&s;&s;es, or
quantities of matter. Thus, there are in Nature
powers, and even of the mo&s;t active kind, which
penetrate the internal parts of matter. We
are unable to form di&s;tinct ideas of &s;uch qualities;
becau&s;e, not being external, they fall not under
the cogni&s;ance of our &s;en&s;es. But we can com|pare
their effects, and may draw analogies from
them, in order to account for the effects of &s;imi|lar
qualities.</P>
<P>If our eyes, in place of repre&s;enting to us only
the &s;urfaces of bodies, were &s;o con&s;tructed as to
perceive their internal parts alone, we &s;hould then
have clear ideas of the latter, without knowing
any thing of the former. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition,
moulds for the internal con&s;titution, which I have
&s;uppo&s;ed to be employed by Nature, would be equal|ly
obvious and ea&s;y to conceive as moulds for the
external figures of bodies; and we &s;hould then
be in a condition to imitate the internal parts of
bodies, as we now imitate the external. The&s;e
internal moulds, though beyond our reach, may
be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nature, as &s;he endows
bodies with gravity, which penetrates every par|ticle
of matter. The &s;uppo&s;ition of internal
moulds being thus founded on analogy, let us
<PB N="33" REF="36">
next examine whether it involves any contradic|tion.</P>
<P>It may be alledged, that the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>inter|nal
mould,</HI> includes two oppo&s;ite and contradic|tory
ideas; for the idea of a <HI>mould</HI> relates only to
the furface; but the idea of internal, as here em|ployed,
has a relation to the whole ma&s;s; and
therefore we might, with equal propriety, talk
of a ma&s;&s;y furface as of an internal mould.</P>
<P>I allow, that, when ideas are attempted to be
repre&s;ented which have never been expre&s;&s;ed,
we are &s;ometimes obliged to u&s;e terms that are
apparently contradictory. To avoid this incon|venience,
philo&s;ophers have been accu&s;tomed to
employ unu&s;ual terms, in place of tho&s;e which
have a received &s;ignification. But this artifice
is of no u&s;e, when we can &s;how, that the &s;eem|ing
contradiction lies in the words, and not in
the idea. But a &s;imple idea cannot include a
contradiction; i. e. whenever we can form an
idea of a thing, if this idea be &s;imple, it cannot
be complex; it can include no other idea; and,
of cour&s;e, it can contain nothing that is oppo&s;ite
or contradictory.</P>
<P>Simple ideas are not only the fir&s;t apprehen|&s;ions
received by the &s;en&s;es, but the fir&s;t com|pari&s;ons
which we form of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions:
For the fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion is always the re&s;ult of
compari&s;on. The idea of the largene&s;s or di|&s;tance
of an object nece&s;&s;arily implies a compa|ri&s;on
with bulk or di&s;tance in general. Thus,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
when a idea includes nothing more than com|pari&s;on,
it ought to be regarded as &s;imple; and,
con&s;equently, it can contain nothing contradic|tory.
The idea of an internal mould is of this
&s;pecies. There is in nature a quality known by
the name of gravity, which penetrates the in|ternal
parts of bodies. I under&s;tand the idea of
an internal mould to be relative to gravity; and,
therefore, as it includes only a compari&s;on, it
can imply no contradiction.</P>
<P>Let us now trace the con&s;equences that may
be drawn from this &s;uppo&s;ition; let us likewi&s;e
inve&s;tigate &s;uch facts as may corre&s;pond with it;
and the more analogies we can collect, the &s;up|po&s;ition
will be rendered the more probable. We
&s;hall begin with unfolding the idea of external
moulds, and how it may lead us to conceive the
mode of reproduction.</P>
<P>Nature, in general, appears to have a greater
bias towards life than death: She &s;eems anxious
to organize bodies as much as po&s;&s;ible. Of this
the multiplication of germs, which may be in|finitely
increa&s;ed, is a convincing proof; and it
may be &s;afely affirmed, that, if all matter is not
organized, it is only becau&s;e organized beings
de&s;troy one another; for we can increa&s;e, at
plea&s;ure, the number of animals and vegetables;
but we cannot augment the quantity of &s;tones
or of dead matter. This appears to indicate, that
the mo&s;t ordinary and familiar operation of Na|ture
<PB N="35" REF="38">
is the production of organized bodies; and
here her power knows no limitation.</P>
<P>To render this more plain, we &s;hall calculate
what may be produced by a &s;ingle germ. The
&s;eed of an elm, which weighs not above the hun|dredth
part of an ounce, will, in 100 years, form
a tree, of which the ma&s;s will amount to ten
cubic fathoms. But, at the tenth year, this elm
will have produced 1000 &s;eeds, each of which, in
100 years more, will con&s;i&s;t of ten cubic fathoms.
Thus, in the &s;pace of 110 years, more than
10,000 cubic fathoms of organized matter are
produced. Ten years after, we &s;hall have ten
million of fathoms, without including the annu|al
increa&s;e of 10,000, which would amount to
100,000 more; and, in ten years more, the num|ber
of cubic fathoms would be 10,000,000,000,000.
Hence, in 130 years, a &s;ingle germ would pro|duce
a ma&s;s of organized matter equal to 1000
cubic leagues; for a cubic league contains only
about 10,000,000,000 cubic fathoms; ten years
after, this ma&s;s would be increa&s;ed to a thou&s;and
times a thou&s;and leagues, or one million of cu|bic
leagues; and, in ten more, it would amount
to 1,000,000,000,000 cubic leagues; &s;o that,
in the &s;pace of 150 years, the whole globe might
be converted into organized matter of a &s;ingle
&s;pecies. Nature would know no bounds in the
production of organized bodies, if her progre&s;s
were not ob&s;tructed by matter which is not &s;u&s;|ceptible
<PB N="36" REF="39">
of organization; and this is a full de|mon&s;tration
that &s;he has no tendency to increa&s;e
brute matter; that her &s;ole object is the multi|plication
of organized beings; and that, in this
operation, &s;he never &s;tops but when irre&s;i&s;tible
ob&s;tacles occur. What we have remarked con|cerning
the &s;eed of an elm, may be extended to
any other germ; and it would be ea&s;y to &s;how,
that, by hatching all the eggs which are produ|ced
by hens for a cour&s;e of 30 years, the num|ber
of fowls would be &s;o great as to cover the
whole &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>Calculations of this kind evince the tenden|cy
of Nature towards the production of orga|nized
bodies, and the facility with which &s;he
performs the operation. But I will not &s;top
here. In&s;tead of dividing matter into <HI>orga|nized</HI>
and <HI>brute matter,</HI> the general divi&s;ion ought
to be into <HI>living</HI> and <HI>dead matter.</HI> That what
is called <HI>brute matter</HI> is nothing but matter
produced by the <HI>death</HI> of animals and vegetables,
might be proven from the enormous quantities
of &s;hells, and other relicts of living bodies,
which con&s;titute the principal part of &s;tones,
marbles, clays, marles, earths, turfs, and other
&s;ub&s;tances that are commonly reckoned <HI>brute
matter,</HI> but are, in reality, compo&s;ed of decayed
animals and vegetables. This doctrine will be
farther illu&s;trated by the &s;ub&s;equent remarks,
which appear to be well founded.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">
The great facility and activity of Nature in
the production of organized bodies, the exi&s;tence
of infinite numbers of organic particles which
con&s;titute life, have been already demon&s;trated.
We now proceed to inquire into the principal
cau&s;es of death and de&s;truction. In general,
beings which have a power of converting matter
into their own &s;ub&s;tances, or of a&s;&s;imilating the
parts of other beings, are the greate&s;t de&s;troyers.
Fire, for example, which converts almo&s;t every
&s;pecies of matter into its own &s;ub&s;tance, is the
greate&s;t &s;ource of de&s;truction that we are ac|quainted
with. Animals &s;eem to partake of the
nature of flame; their internal heat is a &s;pecies
of fire next to flame. Accordingly, animals are
the greate&s;t de&s;troyers; and they a&s;&s;imilate and
convert into their own &s;ub&s;tance all bodies which
can &s;erve them for nouri&s;hment. But, though
the&s;e two cau&s;es of de&s;truction be very con&s;ide|rable,
and their effects tend perpetually to the
de&s;truction of organized bodies, the cau&s;e of re|production
is infinitely more active and power|ful.
It even &s;eems to derive, from de&s;truction
it&s;elf, fre&s;h powers of multiplying; for a&s;&s;i|milation,
which is one cau&s;e of death, is, at
the &s;ame time, a nece&s;&s;ary mean of producing
life.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of organized bodies, as has
been remarked, is only a &s;eparation of the orga|nic
particles of which they are compo&s;ed. The&s;e
particles continue &s;eparate till they be again u|nited
<PB N="38" REF="41">
by &s;ome active power. But what is this
power? It is the power, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by animals
and vegetables, of a&s;&s;imilating the matter of their
food; and is not this the &s;ame, or nearly con|nected
with the &s;ame power which is the cau&s;e
of reproduction?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Nutrition and Growth.</HEAD>
<P>AN animal body is a kind of internal mould,
in which the nutritive matter is &s;o a&s;&s;i|milated
to the whole, that, without changing
the order or proportion of the parts, each part
receives an augmentation. This increa&s;e of
bulk has, by &s;ome philo&s;ophers, been called an
expan&s;ion or unfolding of the parts; becau&s;e
they fancied they had accounted for the phae|nomenon,
by telling us, that the form of an
animal in embryo was the &s;ame as at full matu|rity,
and that, therefore, it was ea&s;y to conceive
how its parts &s;hould be proportionally unfolded
and augmented by the addition of acce&s;&s;ory
matter.</P>
<P>But, how can we have a clear idea of this aug|mentation
or expan&s;ion, if we con&s;ider not the
bodies of animals, and each of their parts, as &s;o
many internal moulds which receive the acce&s;|&s;ory
matter in the order that re&s;ults from their
po&s;ition and &s;tructure? This expan&s;ion cannot
be effected &s;olely by an addition to the &s;urfaces,
but, on the contrary, by an intus-&s;u&s;ception, or
by penetrating the whole ma&s;s; for the &s;ize of
<PB N="40" REF="43">
the part is augmented proportionally, without
changing its form. Hence it is nece&s;&s;ary, that
the increa&s;ing matter mu&s;t, in &s;ome manner or
other, intimately penetrate the whole part in all
its dimen&s;ions: It is equally nece&s;&s;ary, that this
penetration &s;hould be effected in a fixed order
and proportion, &s;o that no internal point receive
more matter than another; otherwi&s;e &s;ome parts
would be more quickly unfolded than others,
which would entirely change their figure. What
can thus regulate the acce&s;&s;ory matter, and force
it to arrive equally and proportionally to every
internal point of the body, if we have not re|cour&s;e
to an internal mould?</P>
<P>The bodies of animals and of vegetables, there|fore,
con&s;i&s;t of internal moulds, which uniform|ly
pre&s;erve the &s;ame figure. But their ma&s;&s;es
may receive a proportional increa&s;e, by the ex|pan&s;ion
of the moulds in all their dimen&s;ions,
both internal and external; and this expan&s;ion
is effected by an intus-&s;u&s;ception of an acce&s;|&s;ory
and foreign matter, which intimately pe|netrates
the whole, and a&s;&s;umes the &s;ame form
and identity of &s;ub&s;tance with the matter of the
moulds them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But what is the nature of that matter which
an animal, or a vegetable, a&s;&s;imilates to its own
&s;ub&s;tance? What be&s;tows on it that force and
activity which enables it to penetrate the inter|nal
mould? If &s;uch a power exi&s;ts, mu&s;t it not
<PB N="41" REF="44">
be &s;imilar to that by which the mould it&s;elf is
capable of being reproduced?</P>
<P>The&s;e three que&s;tions include the whole &s;ub|ject,
and appear to depend on one another; for
it is impo&s;&s;ible to explain, in a &s;atisfactory man|ner,
the reproduction of animals or vegetables,
if we have not a clear idea how the operation
of nutrition is performed. Each que&s;tion, there|fore,
demands a &s;eparate examination, that we
may be enabled to compare their re&s;ults.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, which regards the nature and qua|lities
of the nutritive matter, is in part re&s;olved
by the preceding rea&s;onings, and &s;hall be clear|ly
unfolded in the &s;ub&s;equent chapters. We
&s;hall demon&s;trate, that there are in nature infi|nite
numbers of living organic particles; that
nature produces them without any expence,
becau&s;e their exi&s;tence is con&s;tant and invariable;
that the cau&s;es of death only di&s;unite the&s;e par|ticles,
but do not de&s;troy them. Thus the mat|ter
a&s;&s;imilated by an animal or vegetable, is an
organic matter of the &s;ame nature with that of
the animal or vegetable, and, con&s;equently, may
augment the &s;ize without changing the figure or
the qualities of the original moulds; becau&s;e it
has the &s;ame qualities and the &s;ame form with
the matter of which the moulds them&s;elves are
compo&s;ed. Of the quantity of aliment taken
by an animal to &s;upport its life, and to maintain
the vigour of its organs, and of the juices ab|&s;orbed
by the roots and leaves of a plant, a great
<PB N="42" REF="45">
part is rejected by tran&s;piration, by &s;ecretions,
and by other excretories; and a &s;mall portion
only is retained for the nouri&s;hment and expan|&s;ion
of the parts. It is extremely probable, that,
in the bodies of animals and of vegetables, a &s;e|paration
is made between the <HI>brute</HI> particles of
the aliment and the organic; that the former are
carried off by the methods ju&s;t mentioned; that
nothing but the organic particles remain; and
that they are di&s;tributed, by means of &s;ome active
power, to the different parts, in a proportion &s;o
exact, that neither more nor fewer are applied
than an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of nutrition, and of an
equal growth and expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd que&s;tion, What is the nature
of that active power, which enables the organic
matter to penetrate and combine with the inter|nal
mould? It is apparent, from the preceding
chapter, that powers exi&s;t in nature, like that of
gravity, which affect the mo&s;t internal parts of
matter, without having the &s;malle&s;t relation to
its external qualities. The&s;e powers, as former|ly
ob&s;erved, are beyond the reach of our &s;en&s;es;
becau&s;e their action is exerted upon the intimate
&s;tructure of bodies. It is evident, therefore, that
we can never obtain a clear idea of them, nor
of their mode of acting. Their exi&s;tence, how|ever,
is not le&s;s certain, than that, by means of
them, mo&s;t natural effects are produced, e&s;pe|cially
tho&s;e of nutrition and expan&s;ion, which
mu&s;t be owing to a cau&s;e which penetrates the
<PB N="43" REF="46">
mo&s;t intimate rece&s;&s;es of the original moulds;
for, in the &s;ame manner as gravity pervades the
whole parts of matter, the power which pu&s;hes
forward or attracts the organic particles of food,
penetrates the internal parts of organized bodies;
and, as the&s;e bodies have a certain form, which
we have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>in|ternal
moulds,</HI> the organic particles, pu&s;hed on
by the action of this penetrating force, mu&s;t en|ter
in an order relative to this form, and con&s;e|quently
cannot alter its figure, but only augment
its bulk, and give ri&s;e to the growth and expan|&s;ion
of organized bodies: And if, in the orga|nized
body, thus expanded, there be &s;ome par|ticles
&s;imilar to the whole, both internally and
externally, the&s;e parts will become the &s;ource of
reproduction.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the third que&s;tion, name|ly,
Is it not by a &s;imilar power that the internal
mould it&s;elf is reproduced? This power appears to
be not only &s;imilar, but the very &s;ame with that
which is the cau&s;e of expan&s;ion and reproduc|tion;
for, in an organized and expanded body,
nothing farther is nece&s;&s;ary for the reproduction
of a new body &s;imilar to it&s;elf, than that it &s;hould
contain &s;ome particle every way &s;imilar to the
whole. This particle, at its fir&s;t &s;eparation, will
not pre&s;ent to our eyes a &s;en&s;ible figure by which
we can compare it with the whole body. But,
when &s;eparated from the body, and put in a &s;i|tuation
to receive proper nouri&s;hment, this &s;imi|lar
<PB N="44" REF="47">
particle will begin to expand and to exhibit
the form of an entire and independent being, of
the &s;ame &s;pecies with that from which it was
detached. Thus, a willow or a polypus, as they
contain a larger proportion of particles &s;imilar
to the whole, than mo&s;t other &s;ub&s;tances, when
cut into any indefinite number of pieces, each
&s;egment becomes a new body &s;imilar to the pa|rent
from which it was &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Now, in a body of which all the particles are
&s;imilar to it&s;elf, the organization is the mo&s;t
&s;imple, as has been remarked in the fir&s;t chap|ter;
for it is only a repetition of the &s;ame form,
a congeries of figures &s;imilarly organized. It is
for this rea&s;on that the mo&s;t &s;imple bodies, the
mo&s;t imperfect &s;pecies, are mo&s;t ea&s;ily and mo&s;t
abundantly reproduced. But, if an organized
body contain only few particles &s;imilar to it&s;elf,
as the&s;e alone are capable of a &s;econd expan&s;ion,
its power of reproducing will be both more dif|ficult,
and more circum&s;cribed as to the number
produced. The organization of bodies of this
la&s;t kind is al&s;o more complex, becau&s;e it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
fewer parts which are &s;imilar to the whole;
and, therefore, the more perfectly a body is or|ganized,
its power of reproduction will be pro|portionally
dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>In this manner we di&s;cover nouri&s;hment,
growth, and propagation, to be effects of the &s;ame
cau&s;e. Organized bodies are nouri&s;hed by the
particles of aliment which are &s;imilar to them;
<PB N="45" REF="48">
they grow or are expanded by ab&s;orbing tho&s;e or|ganic
particles which corre&s;pond to their own na|ture;
and they propagate, becau&s;e they contain
&s;ome organic particles &s;imilar to them&s;elves. It
only remains to examine whether the&s;e &s;imilar
organic particles are extracted from the food, or
have a primary and independent exi&s;tence in the
bodies them&s;elves. If we &s;uppo&s;e the latter, we
recur to the infinity of &s;imilar parts or germs
contained within each other, an hypothe&s;is which
we have already demon&s;trated to be replete with
difficulties and ab&s;urdities. We mu&s;t, therefore,
hold, that the &s;imilar parts are extracted from the
food; and, after what has been &s;aid on the &s;ub|ject,
we hope to be able to explain the manner
of their ab&s;orption, and how the more minute
organic particles which compo&s;e them are u|nited.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the organic parts
of food were &s;eparated from tho&s;e which have
no analogy to the animal or vegetable, by tran|&s;piration
and other excretions. The fir&s;t re|main,
and &s;erve to expand and nouri&s;h the body:
But the&s;e organic parts mu&s;t be of very differ|ent
&s;pecies; and, as each part of the body re|ceives
only a proper number of tho&s;e which corre|&s;pond
to it, the &s;urplus, it is natural to imagine,
will be returned from all parts of the body, and
be collected in one or more re&s;ervoirs, where they
will unite and form &s;mall organic bodies &s;imilar
to the fir&s;t, and which require nothing but pro|per
<PB N="46" REF="49">
circum&s;tances for expanding and becoming
new individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies; for, all parts
of the body &s;ending off organic particles &s;imilar
to tho&s;e of which them&s;elves are compo&s;ed, the
re&s;ult of their union mu&s;t be the production of
new organized bodies &s;imilar to the original.
This being granted, may we not conclude, that
this is the rea&s;on why organized bodies, during
the time of their growth and expan&s;ion, are &s;el|dom
or never capable of reproducing; becau&s;e
the growing parts ab&s;orb the whole organic par|ticles
pre&s;ented to them, and no &s;urplus being
&s;ent from the different parts of the body, pro|pagation
becomes, of cour&s;e, impracticable?</P>
<P>This account of nutrition, and of reproduc|tion,
will not, perhaps, be received by tho&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers
who admit only a certain number of
mechanical principles, and reject every thing as
fal&s;e which depends not upon them; and, as the
explication now given of nutrition and repro|duction
has no connection with any of the&s;e
principles, they will conclude that it de&s;erves
no credit. But I think very differently from
the&s;e philo&s;ophers. In admitting only a few
mechanical principles, they con&s;ider not how
much they contract the bounds of philo&s;ophy,
and how few phaenomena can, by this narrow
method of thinking, be fully expi&s;cated.</P>
<P>The notion of explaining all the appearances
in nature upon the principles of mechani&s;m, is,
doubtle&s;s, a great exertion, and was fir&s;t attempt|ed
<PB N="47" REF="50">
by Des Cartes. But it is, at lea&s;t, an unte|nible
project; and, though it were otherwi&s;e,
we are unable to put it in execution. The&s;e
mechanical principles are, the exten&s;ion of mat|ter,
its impenetrability, its motion, its external
figure, its divi&s;ibility, the communication of mo|tion
by impul&s;e, by the action of &s;prings, &amp;c.
The&s;e ideas we have acquired by our &s;en&s;es, and
we regard them as principles, becau&s;e they are
general and common to all matter. But are we
certain that matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no other qualities?
Ought we not rather to believe that the&s;e qua|lities,
which we a&s;&s;ume for principles, are only
modes of perception; and that, if the confor|mation
of our &s;en&s;es were different, we would
recognize qualities in matter very different from
tho&s;e above enumerated? It is pre&s;umptuous to
deny every quality to matter but tho&s;e we are
acquainted with. Many general qualities, per|haps,
remain to be di&s;covered; and many may
exi&s;t which will for ever elude human di&s;cern|ment.
The cau&s;e of impul&s;ion, of cohe&s;ion, or
of any other mechanical principle, will always
continue to be equally in&s;crutable as that of at|traction,
or of any other general quality. Hence
it may be concluded, that mechanical principles
are nothing el&s;e than general effects which ex|perience
has enabled us to remark in matter;
and that, whenever we &s;hall di&s;cover, either by
reflection, by analogy, or by experience, a new
general effect, it will become a new mechanical
<PB N="48" REF="51">
principle, which may be employed with equal
advantage and certainty as any of tho&s;e that are
already known.</P>
<P>The defect of Ari&s;totle's philo&s;ophy was the
employing particular effects as cau&s;es; and that
of Des Cartes con&s;i&s;ts in the rejection of every
cau&s;e, but a few general effects. To u&s;e nothing
as cau&s;es but general effects, to endeavour to
augment the number of the&s;e, and to attempt to
generalize particular effects, would con&s;titute the
mo&s;t perfect principles of genuine philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In my theory of expan&s;ion and reproduction,
I fir&s;t admit the mechanical principles, then the
penetrating force of gravity, and, from analogy
and experience, I have concluded the exi&s;tence
of other penetrating forces peculiar to organized
bodies. I have proved by facts, that matter has
a &s;trong tendency towards organization; and
that there are in nature an infinite number of
organic particles. I have, therefore, only gene|ralized
particular ob&s;ervations, without advan|cing
any thing contrary to mechanical principles,
when that term is u&s;ed in its proper &s;en&s;e, as de|noting
the general effects of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>AS the organization of men, and of other
animals, is the mo&s;t perfect, and the
mo&s;t complex, the propagation of them is like|wi&s;e
mo&s;t difficult, and the number of indivi|duals
is le&s;s abundant. I except here &s;uch ani|mals
as can be multiplied by a &s;eparation of their
parts, or without the aid of generation, the&s;e
having been &s;ufficiently treated of in the pre|ceding
chapter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the Author gives an unnece&s;&s;ary recapitulation of Chap. III. to which the reader is referred.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But how will the theory delivered in the
former chapter apply to the generation of men,
and other animals, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by
&s;exes? We under&s;tand, from what has been &s;aid,
how every individual may reproduce; but we
cannot conceive how two individuals, the one a
male, and the other a female, &s;hould uniformly
produce a third.</P>
<P>Before replying to this objection, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that the writers on this &s;ubject have con|fined
their ideas &s;olely to the generation of men
and of animals, without attending to the nature
<PB N="50" REF="53">
of reproduction in general: And, as the generation
of animals is the mo&s;t complicated &s;pecies of re|production,
they have laboured under great di&s;|advantages,
not only by attacking the mo&s;t diffi|cult
point, but by leaving them&s;elves no &s;ubject
of compari&s;on to enable them to illu&s;trate the
que&s;tion. To this circum&s;tance I chiefly attri|bute
the un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of their attempts. But,
by the route I have taken, I am per&s;uaded that
I &s;hall be able to give a &s;atisfactory explanation
of every &s;pecies of reproduction.</P>
<P>Let the generation of man &s;erve as an ex|ample.
To begin with infancy:</P>
<P>The expan&s;ion and growth of the different
parts of man's body being effected by the inti|mate
penetration of organic particles analogous
to each of the&s;e parts, all the organic particles, in
early life, are ab&s;orbed, and entirely employed
in unfolding and augmenting his different mem|bers.
He has, of cour&s;e, little or no &s;uperflu|ous
particles, till his growth be completed. It is
for this rea&s;on that infants are incapable of pro|pagating.
But, when his body has nearly at|tained
its full &s;ize, he requires not the &s;ame
quantity of organic particles; the &s;urplus is,
therefore, &s;ent from all parts into re&s;ervoirs de|&s;tined
for their reception. The&s;e re&s;ervoirs are
the te&s;tes and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els. At this very pe|riod,
when the growth of the body is nearly
fini&s;hed, puberty commences, and every phae|nomenon
attending it di&s;covers a &s;uperabundance
<PB N="51" REF="54">
of nouri&s;hment: The voice changes into a
deeper tone; the beard begins to appear, and
other parts of the body are covered with hair;
the parts de&s;tined for generation are &s;uddenly
expanded; the &s;eminal fluid fills the re&s;ervoirs
prepared for its reception; and, without pro|vocation,
it e&s;capes from the body during &s;leep.
This &s;uperabundance is &s;till more evident in the
female: It di&s;covers it&s;elf by a periodic evacua|tion,
which begins and terminates with the fa|culty
of propagating; by a quick increa&s;e of the
brea&s;ts; and by a change in the &s;exual parts,
which &s;hall be afterwards explained<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See below the Nat. Hi&s;t. of Man, chap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I conceive, then, that the organic particles
&s;ent from all parts of the body into the te&s;ticles
and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els of the male, and into the
ovarium of the female, compo&s;e the &s;eminal
fluid, which, in either &s;ex, as formerly ob&s;erved,
is a kind of extract from the &s;everal parts of the
body. The&s;e organic particles, in&s;tead of uni|ting
and forming an individual &s;imilar to that in
who&s;e body they are contained, as happens in
vegetables, and &s;ome imperfect animals, cannot
accompli&s;h this end without a mixture of the
fluids of both &s;exes. When this mixture is made,
if the organic particles of the male exceed tho&s;e
of the female, the re&s;ult is a male; and, if tho&s;e
of the female mo&s;t abound, a female is gene|rated.
I mean not that the organic particles of
the male or of the female could &s;ingly produce
<PB N="52" REF="55">
individuals: A concurrence or union of both is
requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h this end. Tho&s;e &s;mall
moving bodies, called <HI>&s;permatic animals,</HI> which,
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope, are &s;een in
the &s;eminal fluids of all male animals, are, per|haps,
organized &s;ub&s;tances proceeding from the
individual which contains them; but, of them|&s;elves,
they are incapable of expan&s;ion, or of
becoming animals &s;imilar to tho&s;e in whom they
exi&s;t. We &s;hall afterwards demon&s;trate, that
there are &s;imilar animalcules in the &s;eminal fluids
of females, and point out the place where this
fluid is to be found.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the&s;e organic bodies are
only the fir&s;t rudiments of an animal, containing
nothing but its e&s;&s;ential parts. We &s;hall not en|ter
into a detail of proofs on this &s;ubject, but
content our&s;elves with remarking, that the or|ganization
of the&s;e pretended &s;permatic animals
may be very imperfect; or rather, that they
have the living organic particles mentioned above,
which are common both to vegetables and to
animals; or, at mo&s;t, that they are only the fir&s;t
junction of the&s;e particles.</P>
<P>But, to return to our &s;ubject. It may be a&s;k|ed,
how is it po&s;&s;ible that the &s;uperfluous orga|nic
particles &s;hould be detached from all parts of
the body, and unite upon the mixture of the
male and female fluids? Be&s;ides, are we certain
that &s;uch a mixture takes place? Has it not been
mentioned, that the female furni&s;hes no fluid of
<PB N="53" REF="56">
this kind? Is it an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, that the male
fluid enters the uterus? &amp;c.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t que&s;tion I reply, that, if what I
had &s;aid concerning the penetration of the in|ternal
mould by the organic particles, in growth
and nutrition, had been properly under&s;tood, it
would be ea&s;y to conceive, that, when the&s;e
particles are unable to penetrate the parts into
which they formerly entered, they mu&s;t take
another rout, and, of cour&s;e, arrive at &s;ome
other part, as the te&s;ticles and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els.
Every attempt to explain the animal oeco|nomy,
and the various motions of the human
body, by mechanical principles alone, mu&s;t be
vain and ineffectual; for it is evident, that the
circulation of the blood, mu&s;cular motion, and
other functions of an animated body, cannot be
accounted for by impul&s;ion, or by any of the
common laws of mechani&s;m. It is equally evi|dent,
that growth and reproduction are effects
of laws of a different nature. Why, then, do
we refu&s;e the exi&s;tence of penetrating forces
which act upon the whole &s;ub&s;tances of bodies,
when we have examples of &s;uch powers in gra|vity,
in magnetic attraction, in chemical affini|ties?
Since, therefore, we are a&s;&s;ured by facts,
and by a number of con&s;tant and uniform ob|&s;ervations,
that there are powers in nature which
act not by impul&s;ion, why are not the&s;e powers
ranked among mechanical principles? Why do
we reject them in the explanation of effects
<PB N="54" REF="57">
which they are known to produce? Why are we
de&s;irous of employing only the power of impul|&s;ion?
Is not this equally ab&s;urd as to judge of
painting by the touch; to explain the phaeno|mena
that belong to the ma&s;s by tho&s;e that relate
only to the &s;urface; or to u&s;e one &s;en&s;e in place
of another? It is limiting the rea&s;oning faculty
to a &s;mall number of mechanical principles,
which are by no means &s;ufficient to explain the
various effects of nature.</P>
<P>But, if the&s;e penetrating forces be once ad|mitted,
is it not natural to imagine, that tho&s;e
par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">es which are mo&s;t analogous to one ano|ther
will unite in the mo&s;t intimate manner; that
each part of the body will appropriate tho&s;e
which are mo&s;t agreeable to its nature; and that
the whole &s;uperfluous particles will form a &s;emi|nal
fluid, which &s;hall contain all the organic  <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r|ticles
nece&s;&s;ary for forming a &s;mall organized
body, &s;imilar in every re&s;pect to that from which
the fluid is extracted? May not a force, &s;imilar
to that which is the cau&s;e of growth, be &s;ufficient
to collect the &s;uperfluous organic particles, and
be&s;tow on them the figure of the body from
which they proceed?</P>
<P>That our food contains an immen&s;e number
of organic particles, requires no formal proof;
&s;ince we are &s;olely nouri&s;hed by animals and ve|getables,
which are organized &s;ub&s;tances. In the
&s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the gro&s;s parts of the a|liment
are &s;eparated and rejected by the excre|tories.
<PB N="55" REF="58">
The chyle, which is a purer part of
the aliment, is ab&s;orbed by the lacteal ve&s;&s;els;
from thence it is carried into the ma&s;s of blood,
and, in the cour&s;e of circulation, it is more and
more refined, the unorganic and u&s;ele&s;s particles
being thrown out by tran&s;piration and other &s;e|cretions:
But the organic particles are retained,
becau&s;e they are analogous to the blood, and are
attracted by it. Hence, as the whole ma&s;s of
blood pa&s;&s;es &s;everal times through the body,
during the cour&s;e of this perpetual circula|tion,
I &s;uppo&s;e, that each particular part attracts
tho&s;e particles which are mo&s;t analagous to it,
and allows the re&s;t to move on. In this manner
all the parts are nouri&s;hed and unfolded, not, as
is commonly imagined, by a &s;imple addition of
matter to their furfaces, but by an intimate pene|tration
of &s;ub&s;tance, effected by a force which
acts equally upon every point of the whole ma&s;s:
And, after the different parts have acquired their
utmo&s;t growth, and are fully impregnated
with &s;imilar organic particles, as their &s;ub&s;tance
becomes then more den&s;e and &s;olid, I imagine
that they lo&s;e their faculty of attracting and re|ceiving
the particles pre&s;ented to them. But, as
the particles continue to be carried round in the
cour&s;e of the circulation, and are no longer ab|&s;orbed
in &s;uch quantities as formerly, they mu&s;t,
of nece&s;&s;ity, be depo&s;ited in &s;ome particular re|&s;ervoir,
&s;uch as the te&s;ticles and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els.
When this fluid extract of the male is mixed
<PB N="56" REF="59">
with that of the female, the particles which are
mo&s;t analogous to each other, being actuated by
a penetrating force, unite and form a &s;mall or|ganized
body, &s;imilar to the one or the other
&s;ex; and this body, when once formed, requires
only an expan&s;ion of its parts, an operation
which is performed in the womb of the mother.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider the &s;econd que&s;tion,
namely, whether the female has a &s;eminal fluid
&s;imilar to that of the male? In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place,
though &s;uch a fluid exi&s;ts in females, the mode of
emi&s;&s;ion is very different from that of the male,
being generally confined within the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quod intra &s;e &s;emen jacit, foemina vocatur; quod in hac <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">acit, mas; <HI>Ari&s;tot. de animalibus, art.</HI> 18.</NOTE>. The
antients were &s;o confident of the exi&s;tence of a
female fluid, that they di&s;tingui&s;hed the two
&s;exes by their different modes of emi&s;&s;ion. But
tho&s;e phy&s;icians who attempt to explain genera|tion
by eggs, or by &s;permatic animalcules, in&s;i&s;t,
that females have no peculiar fluid; that the
mucus i&s;&s;uing from the parts has been mi&s;taken
for a &s;eminal fluid; and that the opinion of the
antients on this &s;ubject is de&s;titute of foundation.
This fluid, however, does exi&s;t; and the doubts
concerning it have ari&s;en &s;olely from attachment
to &s;y&s;tems, and from the difficulty of di&s;cover|ing
its re&s;ervoir. The fluid which is &s;eparated
from the glands about the neck and orifice of the
uterus, has no vi&s;ible re&s;ervoir; and, as it flows
out of the body, it is natural to think that it is
<PB N="57" REF="60">
not the prolific fluid, becau&s;e it cannot co-ope|rate
in the formation of the foetus, which is
performed within the uterus. The re&s;ervoir for the
prolific fluid of the female, therefore, mu&s;t be &s;itu|ated
in a different part: It even flows abundant|ly;
though, like that of the male, a &s;mall quan|tity
is &s;ufficient to produce a foetus. If a little
of the male fluid enters the uterus, either by its
orifice or by ab&s;orption, and meets with the
&s;malle&s;t drop of the female fluid, it is &s;ufficient
for the purpo&s;e of propagation. Thus, nei|ther
the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome anatomi&s;ts, who
maintain that the &s;eminal fluid of the male can
have no admi&s;&s;ion into the uterus, nor the oppo|&s;ite
opinion maintained by their antagoni&s;ts,
have any influence upon the theory we are en|deavouring
to e&s;tabli&s;h. But the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e points we leave to a future opportunity.</P>
<P>Having obviated &s;uch objections as might be
made, let us attend to the evidences that concur
in &s;upporting our hypothe&s;is. The fir&s;t ari&s;es
from the analogy between growth and repro|duction.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to give a &s;atisfactory
account of growth or expan&s;ion, without having
recour&s;e to tho&s;e penetrating forces, tho&s;e affini|ties
or attractions which we employed in explain|ing
the formation of the &s;mall organic bodies
that are &s;imilar to the large bodies which con|tain
them. A &s;econd analogy is derived from
this circum&s;tance, that both nutrition and repro|duction
proceed, not only from the &s;ame effi|cient,
<PB N="58" REF="61">
but from the &s;ame material cau&s;e, namely,
the organic particles of food; and what proves
the &s;urplus of the nutritive particles to be the
cau&s;e of reproduction, is, that the body is not in
a condition to propagate till its growth be fini&s;h|ed:
Of this we have daily examples, in dogs and
other animals, who follow, more clo&s;ely than
we do, the laws of nature: They have no in|clination
to propagate till they have nearly at|tained
their full growth; and by this we know
whether the growth of a dog be fini&s;hed; for
he &s;eldom grows after being in a condition to
generate.</P>
<P>Another proof that the &s;eminal fluid is form|ed
of the &s;urplus of the nutritive particles, ari&s;es
from the condition of eunuchs and other muti|lated
animals: In this unnatural &s;tate, animals
grow fatter than tho&s;e who retain all their parts.
The &s;uperabundance of nutriment, having no
organs for its evacuation, changes the whole ha|bit
of their bodies. The knees and haunches
of eunuchs grow uncommonly large. The rea|&s;on
is evident. After their bodies have acquired
the common &s;ize, if the &s;uperfluous organic par|ticles
found an i&s;&s;ue, as in other men, the growth
would proceed no farther. But, as they want
organs for emitting the &s;eminal fluid, which is
nothing but the &s;uperfluous nutritive particles,
it remains in the body, and has a con&s;tant ten|dency
to expand the parts beyond their natural
&s;ize. Now, bones, it is well known, grow or
<PB N="59" REF="62">
extend by their extremities, which are &s;oft and
&s;pongy, and, when they have once acquired &s;o|lidity,
they are incapable of farther exten&s;ion:
Hence the &s;uperfluous organic particles can on|ly
enlarge the &s;pongy extremities of bones; and
this is the rea&s;on why the haunches, knees, &amp;c.
of eunuchs augment to a di&s;proportioned bulk.</P>
<P>But the &s;tronge&s;t proof of the truth of our pre&s;ent
doctrine ari&s;es from the re&s;emblance of children
to their parents. Sons, in general, re&s;emble their
fathers more than their mothers, and daughters
have a greater re&s;emblance to their mothers than
their fathers; becau&s;e, with regard to the gene|ral
habit of body, a man re&s;embles a man more
than a woman, and a woman re&s;embles a wo|man
more than a man. But, as to particular
features or habits, children &s;ometimes re&s;emble
the father, &s;ometimes the mother, and &s;ometimes
both. A child, for example, will have the eyes
of the father, and the mouth of the mother, or
the colour of the mother and the &s;tature of the
father. Of &s;uch phaenomena it is impo&s;&s;ible
to give any explication, unle&s;s we admit that
both parents have contributed to the formation
of the child, and, con&s;equently, that there has
been a mixture of two &s;eminal fluids.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;emblances long embarra&s;&s;ed me, and,
till I had maturely con&s;idered the &s;ubject of ge|neration,
led me into many errors and prejudices:
And it was not without much thought, a minute
<PB N="60" REF="63">
examination of a great number of families, and a
multiplicity of evidence, that I could prevail on
my&s;elf to alter my former opinion, and to em|brace
what I now believe to be truth. But the
objections which might occur concerning mulat|toes,
mongrels, mules, and particular parental
re&s;emblances, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing my theory,
I de&s;pair not of being able to &s;how that they
&s;trengthen and confirm it.</P>
<P>In youth, the &s;eminal fluid is le&s;s copious, but
more &s;timulating. Its quantity continues to
augment till a certain age; becau&s;e, in propor|tion
as we approach that age, the parts of the
body become more &s;olid, admit fewer nutritive
particles, &s;end back more of them to the com|mon
re&s;ervoirs, and, of cour&s;e, augment the
quantity of the &s;eminal fluid. Thus, if the ex|ternal
organs have not been u&s;ed, middle-aged
men, or even old men, procreate with more ea&s;e

with the vegetable tribes: A tree, the older it is,
produces the greater quantity of fruit.</P>
<P>Young people, who, by forced irritations, de|termine
an unnatural quantity of this fluid into
the re&s;ervoirs prepared for its reception, imme|diately

They lo&s;e, by premature and too frequent eva|cuations,
the very &s;ub&s;tance which nature in|tended
for the nouri&s;hment and growth of their
bodies.</P>

Men who are thin, but not emaciated, and

not only &s;aw this liquor forming in the milt of
the <HI>Calmar,</HI> but likewi&s;e the &s;permatic animals,
and the milt it&s;elf, which have no exi&s;tence till
the month of October, when this fi&s;h &s;pawns on
the coa&s;ts of Portugal, where Needham made
the ob&s;ervation. After the &s;pawning time is
over, the &s;eminal liquor, the &s;permatic animals,
and the milt, dry up and totally di&s;appear; till
the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on returns next year, when the
&s;uperfluous nutritive particles renew the milt as
formerly. The hi&s;tory of the deer will furni&s;h
us with an opportunity of remarking the various
effects of rutting, the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of which
is the extenuation of the animal; and, in tho&s;e
&s;pecies of animals who&s;e rutting or &s;pawning

<P>As women are &s;maller and weaker than men,
as their con&s;titutions are more delicate, and, as
they take le&s;s food, it is natural to think that
their &s;uperfluous organic particles &s;hould al&s;o
be le&s;s abundant: Of cour&s;e, their &s;eminal fluid

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Examination of the different Sy&s;tems of Generation.</HEAD>
<P>PLATO, in the Timaeus, accounts not only
for the generation of men, of animals, of
plants, and of the elements, but even of the hea|vens
and of the gods them&s;elves, by images
reflected or extracted from the divine Creator;
which images, by an harmonic movement, are
arranged in the mo&s;t perfect order, according to
the properties of number. The univer&s;e, he
&s;ays, is a copy of the Deity; time, &s;pace, mo|tion,
and matter, are the images or repre&s;enta|tions
of his attributes; and &s;econdary and parti|cular
cau&s;es are re&s;ults of the numeric and har|monic
qualities of the&s;e images: The world,
from its excellency, is the mo&s;t perfect animated
being. To give the world complete perfection,
it was nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould contain all the o|ther
animals, or all the po&s;&s;ible forms and
repre&s;entations of the creative power. Man is
one of the&s;e forms. The e&s;&s;ence of all genera|tion
con&s;i&s;ts in the unity and harmony of the
number Three, or of the Triangle, namely, that
which generates, that in which generation is
performed, and the re&s;ult, or that which is
generated. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of individuals in the
<PB N="65" REF="68">
&s;pecies, is only a fugitive image of the immu|table
eternity of this harmonic triangle, a uni|ver&s;al
prototype of all exi&s;tences, and of all ge|nerations.</P>
<P>This philo&s;opher paints only ideas. Di&s;en|gaged
from matter, he flies into the regions of
ab&s;traction; and, lo&s;ing &s;ight of &s;en&s;ible objects,
he contemplates tho&s;e of intellect alone. One
cau&s;e, one end, one mean, compo&s;e the whole
of his perceptions: God is the cau&s;e, perfection
the end, and harmonic repre&s;entations the means.
This idea is &s;ublime; the mode of philo&s;ophi|&s;ing
is noble and full of &s;implicity; but it is
perfectly vacant, and affords no objects for &s;pe|culation.
We are not pure intelligences. We
are unable to give real exi&s;tence to our ideas.
Chained to matter, or rather depending on the
cau&s;es of our &s;en&s;ations, it is impo&s;&s;ible that we
&s;hould reali&s;e ab&s;tractions. To Plato I might
reply in his own manner, 'The Creator reali&s;es
every thing he conceives; his perceptions be|get
exi&s;tence: The created being, on the con|trary,
conceives nothing but by retrenching
from reality; and annihilation is nece&s;&s;ary to
bring forth his ideas.'</P>
<P>Let us, without regret, therefore, confine our|&s;elves
to a philo&s;ophy more humble and more
material; and, keeping within the &s;phere which
nature has allotted us, let us examine tho&s;e rapid
and daring &s;pirits who attempt, though in vain,
to fly beyond the limits of humanity. The whole
<PB N="66" REF="69">
of this Pythagorean philo&s;ophy, which is purely
intellectual, depends upon two principles, the
one fal&s;e, and the other uncertain; namely, the
real power of ab&s;traction, and the natural exi&s;t|ence
of final cau&s;es. To apprehend numbers to
be real beings; to &s;ay that unity is a general
individual, which not only repre&s;ents all indivi|duals,
but even communicates exi&s;tence to them;
to pretend that unity exerci&s;es the actual power
of engendering another unity nearly re&s;embling
it&s;elf, and of creating two individuals, two &s;ides
of a triangle, that can have no connection or
perfection without a third &s;ide, which is nece&s;|&s;arily
produced by the other two; in fine, to re|gard
numbers, geometrical lines, and metaphy|&s;ical
ab&s;tractions, as real and efficient phy&s;ical
cau&s;es, by which the elements are formed, plants
and animals regenerated, and all the phaeno|mena
of nature produced, appears to be the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;urd abu&s;e of human rea|&s;on,
and an invincible ob&s;tacle to the advance|ment
of knowledge. Be&s;ides, nothing can be
more fallacious than &s;uch chimeras. Sup|po&s;ing
we &s;hould agree with Plato and Mal|branche,
that matter has no exi&s;tence, that ex|ternal
objects are only ideal images of the crea|tive
power, and that we &s;ee every thing in the
Deity him&s;elf; does it follow, that our ideas are
of the &s;ame order with tho&s;e of the Creator, and
that they can produce real exi&s;tences? Are we
not dependent on our &s;en&s;ations? Whether the
<PB N="67" REF="70">
objects which excite &s;en&s;ations be real or imagi|nary,
whether they exi&s;t without or within, whe|ther
it be God or matter that we every where
behold, is to us of little importance: We are
not le&s;s certain of being uniformly affected in
the &s;ame manner by the &s;ame cau&s;es. The re|lations
between our &s;en&s;es and the objects which
affect them, are nece&s;&s;ary and invariable. It is
upon this ba&s;is alone that the principles of phi|lo&s;ophy
ought to be founded, otherwi&s;e our
knowledge mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s and fallacious. Can
an harmonic triangle create the &s;ub&s;tance of the
elements? Is fire, as Plato affirms, an acute tri|angle,
and light and heat two properties of this
triangle? Are water and air rectangular and e|quilateral
triangles? Is the form of the element
of earth a &s;quare, becau&s;e, being the lea&s;t per|fect
of the four elements, it recedes as far as
po&s;&s;ible from a triangle, without departing alto|gether
from its e&s;&s;ence? Do males and females
embrace each other, for no other purpo&s;e but to
complete the triangle of generation? The&s;e Pla|tonic
ideas have two different a&s;pects: In &s;pe|culation,
they &s;eem to proceed from &s;ublime
principles; but the application of them in prac|tice
leads to nothing but fal&s;e and childi&s;h con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Is it difficult to perceive that our ideas origi|nate
from our &s;en&s;es alone; that the objects we
regard as real exi&s;tences, are tho&s;e concerning
which the &s;en&s;es uniformly give the &s;ame te&s;ti|mony;
<PB N="68" REF="71">
that the objects we apprehend as having
a real exi&s;tence, are tho&s;e which are invariably
pre&s;ented to us in the &s;ame manner; that the
mode in which they pre&s;ent them&s;elves has no
dependence upon our will or inclination; that,
of cour&s;e, our ideas, in&s;tead of being the cau&s;es
of things, are only particular effects, which be|come
le&s;s &s;imilar to the objects them&s;elves, in
proportion as they are rendered more general;
and, la&s;tly, that mental ab&s;tractions are only ne|gative
beings, which derive their intellectual ex|i&s;tence
from the faculty we po&s;&s;e&s;s of con&s;ider|ing
objects, without regarding their &s;en&s;ible qua|lities</P>
<P>Is it not, therefore, apparent, that ab&s;tract i|deas
can never be the principles of exi&s;tence, or
of real knowledge? On the contrary, all our
knowledge is derived from comparing and ar|ranging
the re&s;ults of our &s;en&s;ations. The&s;e re|&s;ults
are known by the appellation of <HI>experience,</HI>
the only &s;ource of genuine &s;cience. The em|ployment
of any other principle is an abu&s;e; and
every edifice founded upon ab&s;tract ideas, is a
temple erected to Error.</P>
<P>In philo&s;ophy, error has a more exten&s;ive in|fluence
than in morals. A thing may be fal&s;e
in morals &s;olely becau&s;e it is mi&s;repre&s;ented. But
fal&s;ehood in metaphy&s;ics con&s;i&s;ts not in mi&s;re|pre&s;entation
alone, but in taking for granted what
has no exi&s;tence at all. It is into this mo&s;t per|nicious
&s;pecies of error that the Platoni&s;ts and
<PB N="69" REF="72">
the Sceptics have fallen. Their fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions
have ob&s;cured the natural light of truth, bewil|dered
the rea&s;oning faculties of men, and retard|ed
the progre&s;s of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Final cau&s;es are employed as a &s;econd prin|ciple
by Plato and other theori&s;ts. This prin|ciple
has even been adopted by the vulgar, and
by &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers. A moment's re|flection,
however, will be &s;ufficient to reduce
this principle to its proper value. To &s;ay that
light exi&s;ts becau&s;e we have eyes, and that &s;ounds
exi&s;t becau&s;e we have ears; or to &s;ay that we
have eyes and ears, becau&s;e light and &s;ounds
exi&s;t; is not this preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing? or,
rather, are we any wi&s;er by this kind of rea&s;on|ing?
Will we ever make any di&s;coveries by &s;uch
a mode of explication? Is it not apparent, that
final cau&s;es are only arbitrary relations and
moral ab&s;tractions, which ought to have le&s;s in|fluence
than ab&s;tractions in metaphy&s;ics, becau&s;e
the origin of the former is le&s;s noble and wor&s;e
imagined? And, though Leibnitz has endeavour|ed
to give an elevation to final cau&s;es, under the
appellation of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and eternal fit|ne&s;s
of things, [<HI>rai&s;on &s;uffi&s;ante</HI>], and Plato has
repre&s;ented them under the flattering picture of
ab&s;olute perfection; all the&s;e efforts are in&s;uffi|cient
to cover their native in&s;ignificance and
precariou&s;ne&s;s. Are we better in&s;tructed in the
operations of Nature, becau&s;e we are told that
nothing exi&s;ts without a rea&s;on, or that every
<PB N="70" REF="73">
thing is created with a view to the perfection of
the whole? What is rea&s;onablene&s;s or fitne&s;s?
What is perfection? Are they not moral beings,
created &s;olely by the human intellect? Are they
not arbitrary relations which we have contrived
to generali&s;e? They have no foundation but in
moral affinities, which, &s;o far from producing
any phy&s;ical or real exi&s;tence, change the nature
of truth, and confound the objects of our &s;en|&s;ations,
of our perceptions, and of our under|&s;tandings,
with tho&s;e of our &s;entiments, of our
pa&s;&s;ions, and of our wills<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The tran&s;lator thinks it his duty to apprize the reader, that here, as well as in &s;everal other parts of this work, the author makes an ingenious and plau&s;ible attack again&s;t the exi&s;tence and utility of final cau&s;es. Every philo&s;opher will admit the ab&s;urdity of employing a final cau&s;e as a phy&s;ical principle. M. de Buffon, if he meant only to expo&s;e the mi&s;application of final cau&s;es, had no occa&s;ion to betray &s;o much warmth and anxiety about an object &s;o apparent. But, like too many of our modern French writers, he &s;eems to be ignorant of, or rather intentionally neglects, the di&s;tinction between final and phy&s;ical cau&s;es. Final cau&s;es regard the de&s;ign or the utility of particu|lar objects, whether that utility relates to man, to the objects them&s;elves, or to the general &s;tructure of the univer&s;e. But phy&s;ical cau&s;es are limited to the explanation of particular ef|fects, or modes of exi&s;tence. <HI>Why</HI> were mountains, &s;eas, or in|&s;ects, created? <HI>What</HI> u&s;eful purpo&s;es do they &s;erve? For the &s;o|lution of the&s;e, and &s;imilar que&s;tions, final cau&s;es can alone be employed. But if it be a&s;ked, <HI>How</HI> were mountains and &s;eas formed? <HI>How</HI> were in&s;ects originally produced; and <HI>how</HI> are their different &s;pecies propagated? The&s;e are que&s;tions purely phy&s;ical, and &s;o different in their nature from the former, that nothing but &s;tupidity, or wor&s;e motives, could po&s;&s;ibly confound them.</P>
<P>It may be farther remarked, that final cau&s;es are the greate&s;t &s;tumbling-blocks which lie in the way of athei&s;ts and materiali&s;ts. They, accordingly, &s;train every nerve to remove them. But their force is &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible; their numbers are &s;o immen&s;e; their beauties are &s;o &s;triking, and corre&s;pond &s;o intimately with the warm and benevolent feelings of the heart; the concatenation and mutual dependence of all created beings recogni&s;able by our &s;en&s;es are &s;o apparent, and &s;o illu&s;trious, that no powers of &s;ophi&s;try, no artful mi&s;repre&s;entations, no &s;trokes of ridicule, will ever be able to dimini&s;h their influence, or weaken the force of tho&s;e &s;entiments which the Supreme Being intended they &s;hould excite in the brea&s;ts of his intelligent creatures. Final cau&s;es not only demon&s;trate the exi&s;tence of a Supreme Intelli|gent Power, but the infinite beneficence, and minute attention of that Power to the happine&s;s of tho&s;e beings upon whom He has thought proper to confer exi&s;tence.</P></NOTE>.</P>

Much more might be &s;aid upon this &s;ubject.
But I pretend not to write a treati&s;e on philo|&s;ophy;
and &s;hall therefore return to phy&s;ics,
from which the ideas of Plato, concerning uni|ver&s;al
generation, have diverted my attention.
Ari&s;totle, who was as great a philo&s;opher as
Plato, and a better phy&s;ician, in&s;tead of wan|dering
in the regions of theory, collects facts,
and &s;peaks in a language more intelligible.</P>
<P>Matter, he remarks, which is only a capacity
of receiving forms, a&s;&s;umes, in generation, a fi|gure
&s;imilar to the individual which furni&s;hes it:
And, with regard to animals which generate by
the intervention of &s;exes, he imagines, that the
prolific principle proceeds &s;olely from the male<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ari&s;tot. de Gen. lib. 1. cap. 20. and lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>:
For though, in another place, when &s;peaking of
animals in general, he &s;ays, that the female
<PB N="72" REF="75">
&s;heds a &s;eminal fluid within the body, it appears,
that he regards not this fluid as a prolific prin|ciple;
and yet he tells us, that the men&s;trual
blood &s;erves for the formation, nouri&s;hment,
and growth of the foetus; but that the efficient
principle exi&s;ts alone in the &s;eminal fluid of
the male, which acts not as matter, but as a cau&s;e.
Averrhoes, Avicenna, and other philo&s;ophers who
embraced this opinion of Ari&s;totle, have endea|voured
to prove that females have no prolific
fluid. They alledge, that, as females are fur|ni&s;hed
with a men&s;trual fluid, which is both
nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of ge|neration,
it is unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e them po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of any other, e&s;pecially &s;ince it begins to
appear, like that of the male, at the age of pu|berty.
Be&s;ides, they continue, if females really
have a prolific &s;eminal fluid, why do they not
produce without the intercour&s;e of the male,
&s;ince they contain the prolific principle, as well
as the matter nece&s;&s;ary for the growth and ex|pan&s;ion
of the embryo? This la&s;t rea&s;on is the
only one which merits attention. The men|&s;trual
blood appears to be nece&s;&s;ary for the
growth and nouri&s;hment of the foetus; but &s;till
it may contribute nothing to its fir&s;t formation,
which requires the mixture of both prolific
fluids. Females, therefore, like males, may have
a prolific fluid for the formation of the embryo,
as well as men&s;trual blood for its growth and
nouri&s;hment. The imagination is not unnatu|ral,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
that, as the female po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both a prolific
fluid extracted from all parts of her body, and
likewi&s;e the means of expanding and nouri&s;h|ing,
&s;he &s;hould produce females without any
communication with the male. It mu&s;t be al|lowed,
that this metaphy&s;ical argument u&s;ed by
the Ari&s;totelians for proving that females are
de&s;titute of a prolific fluid, may be urged as the
&s;tronge&s;t argument again&s;t every &s;y&s;tem of ge|neration,
and, in particular, again&s;t that which
I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, it may be &s;aid, that the &s;uper|fluous
organic particles are &s;ent from every part
of the body into the te&s;ticles and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els
of the male, why do they not, by means of your
imaginary attracting forces, form &s;mall organi|zed
bodies &s;imilar to the whole? Why are not
&s;imilar bodies generated in the female, without
any intercour&s;e with the male? If you an&s;wer,
that the male fluid contains only males, that the
female fluid contains only females, that both pe|ri&s;h
for want of the circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary for
expan&s;ion, and that, for the procreation of an
animal, a mixture of both is requi&s;ite; may it
not be demanded, why this mo&s;t complicated,
difficult, and le&s;s fertile mode of generation, is &s;o
invariably preferred by Nature, that all animals,
with a few trifling exceptions, generate by the
mutual commerce of &s;exes?</P>
<P>I &s;hall content my&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, with reply|ing,
that this is the mode actually employed by
<PB N="74" REF="77">
Nature; and, therefore, however complicated it
may appear, it is, in fact, the mo&s;t &s;imple; be|cau&s;e,
as I formerly remarked, whatever mo&s;t
frequently happens, is, in it&s;elf, however it may
&s;eems to us, the mo&s;t &s;imple.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the notion of the Ari&s;totelians, that
females have no &s;eminal fluid, cannot receive our
a&s;&s;ent, if we con&s;ider the &s;trong re&s;emblance of
children to their mothers, and that mules, mu|lattoes,
and mongrels of every kind, uniformly
re&s;emble the mother more than the father; and,
if it be farther con&s;idered, that the generating
organs of the female, like tho&s;e of the male, are
properly formed for preparing and receiving a
&s;eminal fluid, we &s;hall be ea&s;ily induced to be|lieve
the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a fluid, whether it re|&s;ides
in the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, the te&s;ticles, or the
ovaria, or proceeds, by irritation, from the la|cunae
of De Graaf, which are &s;ituated at the neck
and near the orifice of the uterus.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t examine Ari&s;totle's ideas more
fully, as, of all the antients, this great philo&s;opher
has treated the &s;ubject of generation in the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive manner. He di&s;tingui&s;hes animals
into three cla&s;&s;es: 1. Tho&s;e that have blood,
and, with few exceptions, propagate by copula|tion;
2. Tho&s;e that have no blood, and, being
hermaphrodites, produce of them&s;elves without
copulation; and, 3. Tho&s;e that proceed from
putrefaction, and have no parents of any kind.
I &s;hall fir&s;t remark, that this divi&s;ion is exceed|ingly
<PB N="75" REF="78">
improper: Though it be true, that ani|mals
having blood are di&s;tingui&s;hed into male
and female, it is by no means equally true, that
bloodle&s;s animals are, for the mo&s;t part, herma|phrodites:
For the only hermaphrodites we
know, are land-&s;nails and worms; but we are
uncertain whether all &s;hell-animals, and all tho&s;e
which have no blood, be al&s;o hermaphrodites. This
mu&s;t be learned from the particular hi&s;tories of
the&s;e animals. And, with regard to tho&s;e that
are alledged to proceed from putrefaction, as Ari&s;|totle
gives no enumeration of them, many ob|jections
occur; for mo&s;t &s;pecies which the an|tients
believed to proceed from putrefaction,
have, by the moderns, been di&s;covered to pro|ceed
from eggs.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle makes a &s;econd divi&s;ion of animals,
namely, into tho&s;e who have the faculty of pro|gre&s;&s;ive
motion, and tho&s;e who have no &s;uch fa|culty.
All animals who move, and have blood,
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;exes: But tho&s;e which,
like oy&s;ters, adhere to one place, or hardly move
at all, have no &s;exes, and, in this re&s;pect, re|&s;emble
plants; and it is only, he ob&s;erves, from
difference in bulk that they have been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
into male and female. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged,
that we are &s;till uncertain whether
&s;hell-animals have &s;exes: Among oy&s;ters, &s;ome
individuals are fertile, and others not. The fer|tile
individuals are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a delicate
edging or border which &s;urround their bodies,
<PB N="76" REF="79">
and they are called males<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See De&s;landes dans &s;on trait&eacute; de la marine. Paris 1747.</NOTE>. Our ob&s;ervations
on this &s;ubject are extremely limited.</P>
<P>But to proceed. The male, according to A|ri&s;totle,
contains the principle of motion, and
the female the material part of generation. The
organs de&s;tined for this purpo&s;e are different in
different animals. Of the&s;e the te&s;ticles are the
chief in males, and the uterus in females. Qua|drupeds,
birds, and cetaceous animals, have te&s;|ticles;
fi&s;hes and &s;erpents are deprived of them;
but they have two canals for the reception and
maturation of the &s;emen: The&s;e parts, &s;o e&s;&s;ential
to generation, are always double both in males
and females; and, in the male, they retard the
motion of that part of the blood which goes to
the formation of &s;emen. This he proves from
the example of birds who&s;e te&s;ticles &s;well con&s;i|derably
during the &s;ea&s;on of their amours, but
afterwards dimini&s;h &s;o greatly that they can
hardly be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds covered with hair, and the ce|taceous
fi&s;hes, as whales and dolphins, are vivi|parous:
But vipers and cartilagious animals are
not properly viviparous; becau&s;e they produce
an egg within their own bodies, previous to the
exclu&s;ion of the live animal. Oviparous ani|mals
are of two kinds; tho&s;e which produce
perfect eggs, as birds, lizards, turtles, &amp;c.
and tho&s;e which produce imperfect eggs, as
fi&s;hes, who&s;e eggs augment and come to perfec|tion
<PB N="77" REF="80">
after they have been depo&s;ited in the water
by the female: And, in every &s;pecies of ovipa|rous
animals, except birds, the females are larger
than the males, as in fi&s;hes, lizards, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After remarking the&s;e general varieties in the
animal kingdom, Ari&s;totle begins with exami|ning
the opinion of the antient philo&s;ophers, that
the &s;emen, both of the male and the female, was
extracted from all parts of the body; and he
di&s;&s;ents from this opinion; becau&s;e, &s;ays he,
though children often re&s;emble both father and
mother, they &s;ometimes al&s;o re&s;emble their grand|fathers.
Be&s;ides, they re&s;emble their fathers and
mothers in the voice, in the hair, in the nails,
and in the gate and manner of walking. Now,
he proceeds, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;emen to
come from the hair, from the voice, from the
nails, or from any external quality, as that of
the mode of walking. Infants, therefore, re|&s;emble
not their parents, becau&s;e the &s;emen
proceeds from all parts of the body, but for o|ther
rea&s;ons. I will not expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of
the&s;e arguments; but &s;hall only remark, that this
great man appears to have been anxious to differ
from the &s;entiments of former philo&s;ophers: And
I am per&s;uaded, that, whoever peru&s;es his trea|ti&s;e
on generation, will di&s;cover, that a &s;trong
pa&s;&s;ion for e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem different from
that of the antients, obliges him uniformly to
prefer arguments of little probability, to the
<PB N="78" REF="81">
force of proofs, when they &s;tand in oppo&s;ition
to the general principles of his philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The &s;eminal liquor of the male, according to
Ari&s;totle, is &s;ecreted from the blood; and the
men&s;trual fluid of the female is likewi&s;e a &s;ecre|tion
from the blood, and the only matter which
contributes to generation. Females, he conti|nues,
have no other prolific fluid; no mixture,
therefore, of male and female fluid takes place:
This he attempts to prove by ob&s;erving, that
&s;ome women conceive without plea&s;ure; that
few emit any fluid during the time of copula|tion;
that, in general, tho&s;e who are brown, and
have a ma&s;culine air, have no emi&s;&s;ion; and yet
their powers of procreation are not le&s;s than
tho&s;e of a fairer complection and more delicate
appearance, who emit copiou&s;ly. Thus, he
concludes, women furni&s;h nothing for the pur|po&s;es
of generation, but the men&s;trual blood.
This blood is the matter of generation, and the
male fluid contributes nothing but the form:
The male fluid is the efficient cau&s;e, and the prin|ciple
of motion; it is to generation what the
&s;culptor is to a block of marble: The &s;eminal
fluid is the &s;culptor, the men&s;trual blood the
marble, and the foetus the figure. The men|&s;trual
blood receives from the male &s;emen a kind
of &s;oul, which gives it life and motion. This
&s;oul is neither material nor immaterial, becau&s;e
it can neither act upon matter, nor augment the
men&s;trual blood, which is the only matter nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="79" REF="82">
to generation. It is a &s;pirit, &s;ays our phi|lo&s;opher,
&s;imilar to that of the element of the
&s;tars. The heart is the fir&s;t production of this
&s;oul, which is the cau&s;e of its own growth, and
of the growth and di&s;po&s;ition of all the other
members. The men&s;trual blood contains the
<HI>capacities</HI> of all the parts of the foetus; the &s;oul
or &s;pirit of the male &s;emen makes the heart be|gin
to <HI>act,</HI> and communicates to it the powers of
be&s;towing <HI>action</HI> on the other vi&s;cera; and, in
this manner, the different parts of the animal are
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively unfolded. All this appears clear and
luminous to our philo&s;opher. He has only one
doubt, namely, whether the blood or the heart
is fir&s;t realized. And of this he doubted not with|out
rea&s;on; for, though he adopted the opinion
that the heart received its exi&s;tence fir&s;t, Harvey
has &s;ince alledged, from arguments &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle, that the blood, and not the
heart, is fir&s;t realized.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a &s;hort view of what A|ri&s;totle
has delivered on the &s;ubject of genera|tion,
and &s;hall leave the reader to con&s;ider whe|ther
any &s;y&s;tem of the antients be more ob&s;cure,
or more ab&s;urd, than that which he has endea|voured
to e&s;tabli&s;h. His &s;y&s;tem, however, has
been adopted by mo&s;t men of learning. Har|vey
has borrowed many of Ari&s;totle's notions;
but he has al&s;o adopted &s;ome of his own, which
are by no means better founded. It is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing
that Ari&s;totle's theory of generation,
<PB N="80" REF="83">
which was a re&s;ult of his &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy,
where form and matter are the great principles,
where vegetable and &s;en&s;itive &s;ouls are the a|gents
of nature, and where final cau&s;es are real
objects, &s;hould have been received in the &s;chools:
But it is not a little a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee a phy&s;i|cian
and an acute ob&s;erver, like Harvey, carried
down the &s;tream, while, at the &s;ame time, mo&s;t
philo&s;ophers followed the &s;entiments of Hippo|crates
and Galen, which we &s;hall afterwards
take notice of.</P>
<P>We mean not to convey a di&s;advantageous
idea of Ari&s;totle by the account we have given
of his theory of generation. We might, with
equal propriety, judge of De&s;cartes by his trea|ti&s;e
on man. What the&s;e two philo&s;ophers
have remarked concerning the formation of the
foetus &s;hould rather be con&s;idered in the light
of detached ob&s;ervations, or as con&s;equences
which each of them drew from their principles
of philo&s;ophy, than as compleat &s;y&s;tems. Ari&s;|totle
admits, with Plato, final and efficient cau&s;es:
The latter are the &s;en&s;itive and vegetable &s;ouls,
that give form to matter, which, in it&s;elf, is only
a <HI>capacity</HI> of receiving forms: And as, in ge|neration,
the female furni&s;hes the greate&s;t quan|tity
of matter, and as it was repugnant to his
&s;y&s;tem of final cau&s;es, that any effect &s;hould be
produced by two cau&s;es, when one was &s;ufficient
for the purpo&s;e, he concludes, that the woman
alone contains the matter nece&s;&s;ary for procrea|tion:
<PB N="81" REF="84">
Again, another of his principles was, that
matter, in it&s;elf, has no form, and that <HI>form</HI> is
a being di&s;tinct from matter; he therefore main|tains,
that the male furni&s;hes the form, and, of
cour&s;e, that he contributes nothing <HI>material.</HI></P>
<P>De&s;cartes, on the contrary, admitted into his
philo&s;ophy only a few mechanical principles.
By the&s;e he attempted to explain the formation
of the foetus; and he imagined, that he under|&s;tood,
and was able to communicate to others,
the manner in which a living organized body
could be formed by the laws of motion alone.
The principles he employed were different from
tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle. But both of them, in&s;tead
of directing their inquiries to the thing it&s;elf, in
place of examining it with impartiality, only
con&s;idered it in relation to their philo&s;ophic prin|ciples,
which could never be applied with &s;uc|ce&s;s
to the nature of generation, becau&s;e it de|pends,
as has been already &s;hown, upon very
different principles. De&s;cartes, however, admits
the exi&s;tence and nece&s;&s;ary concurrence of the
&s;eminal fluids of both &s;exes. He allows that both
furni&s;h &s;omething material for the purpo&s;es of
generation; and that the fermentation occa&s;ion|ed
by a mixture of the two fluids, is the cau&s;e of
the formation of the foetus.</P>
<P>Hippocrates, who lived about five or &s;ix hun|dred
years before Ari&s;totle, taught an opinion,
which was adopted by Galen, and by mo&s;t phy|&s;icians,
for many ages. He maintained the ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="82" REF="85">
of a female fluid; and even that both
male and female had two fluids, the one &s;trong
and active, the other weaker and more inactive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hippocrat. lib. de Genitura, p. 129, et lib. de Diacta. p. 198. Lugd. Bat. tom. 1. 1665.</NOTE>.
A concurrence of the two &s;tronger fluids produ|ced
a male child, and, of the two weaker, a fe|male.
Thus, according to Hippocrates, there
exi&s;t two kinds of &s;eminal fluids both in the male
and in the female. This notion he &s;upports in
the following manner: Several women, who
produced only girls by their fir&s;t hu&s;band, have
had boys by their &s;econd; and the &s;ame thing
has often happened to men who have had two
wives. Suppo&s;ing this to be fact, it admits of
an ea&s;y explanation, without having recour&s;e to
two different fluids peculiar to each &s;ex; for the
women who had girls only by the fir&s;t hu&s;band,
and boys by the &s;econd, furni&s;hed a greater
quantity of particles proper for generation du|ring
the fir&s;t, than the &s;econd marriage; or the
&s;econd hu&s;band furni&s;hed a greater quantity of
generating particles during the time of the &s;e|cond
marriage, than the fir&s;t. If, at the mo|ment
of conception, the organic particles of the
male are more abundant than tho&s;e of the fe|male,
a male child is the re&s;ult; and, when the
organic particles of the female mo&s;t abound, a
female child is the con&s;equence: It is not, there|fore,
&s;urpri&s;ing, that the hu&s;band &s;hould be foil|ed
with &s;ome women, and have the &s;uperiority
over others.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">
It is farther alledged by Hippocrates, that the
male &s;emen is &s;ecreted from the &s;tronge&s;t and
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential fluids of the body; and he thus
explains the manner in which the &s;ecretion is
performed: 'Venae et nervi,' &s;ays he, 'ab omni
corpore in pudendum vergunt, quibus dum ali|quantulum
teruntur, et cale&s;cunt ac implentur,
velut pruritus incidit, ex hoc toti corpori volup|tas
ac caliditas accidit; quum vero pudendum
teritur et homo movetur, humidum in corpore
cale&s;cit ac di&s;&s;unditur, et a motu conqua&s;&s;atur ac
&s;pume&s;cit, quemadmodum alii humores omnes
conqua&s;&s;ati &s;pume&s;cunt.'</P>
<P>'Sic autem in homine ab humido &s;pume&s;cente
id quod robu&s;ti&s;&s;imum e&s;t ac pingui&s;&s;imum &s;ecer|nitur,
et ad medullam &s;pinalem venit; tendunt
enim in hanc ex omni corpore viae, et di&s;&s;un|dunt
ex cerebro in lumbos ac in totum corpus
et in medullam: Et ex ip&s;a medulla procedunt
viae, ut et ad ip&s;am humidum perferatur et ex

procedit autem non qua urina, verum
alia ip&s;i via e&s;t illi contigua<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fefius's tran&s;lation, tom. 1. p. 129.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will, doubtle&s;s, be perceived by anatomi&s;ts,
that Hippocrates errs in tracing the route of the
&s;eminal fluid. But this affects not his hypothe&s;is,
<PB N="84" REF="87">
that the &s;emen proceeds from every part of the
body, and particularly from the head; becau&s;e,
he remarks, tho&s;e who have had the veins be|hind
their ears cut, &s;ecrete only a weak and often
an unfertile &s;emen. The female likewi&s;e &s;heds
a &s;eminal fluid &s;ometimes within the uterus, and
&s;ometimes without, when the orifice is too open.
The male &s;emen enters the uterus and mixes
with that of the female; and, as each has two
&s;pecies of fluid, the one &s;trong and the other
weak, if both of them furni&s;h the &s;trong kind,
a male foetus is the con&s;equence; and, if both
furni&s;h only the weak kind, the re&s;ult is a fe|male:
Be&s;ides, if in the mixture there are more
particles of the male than of the female fluid,
the child will re&s;emble the father more than the
mother; <HI>et c contra.</HI> Here we might a&s;k him,
what would happen, when the fluid of the one
was &s;trong, and that of the other weak? I can|not
conceive what reply could be made to this
que&s;tion; and, therefore, we are warranted to
reject the opinion of two di&s;tinct fluids in each
&s;ex as perfectly chimerical.</P>
<P>Let us now attend to his account of the for|mation
of the foetus. The &s;eminal fluids fir&s;t
mix in the uterus, and gradually thicken by the
heat of the mother. The mixture extracts the
&s;pirit of heat, and when too warm, part of the
heat e&s;capes into the air. But a cold &s;pirit is
likewi&s;e conveyed to it by the re&s;piration of the
mother: Thus a cold and a hot &s;pirit alternately
<PB N="85" REF="88">
enter the mixture, give life to it, and cover its
&s;urface with a pellicle, which a&s;&s;umes a round
figure, becau&s;e the &s;pirits acting in the center,
expand the matter equally on all &s;ides. I have
&s;een, &s;ays this great phy&s;ician, a foetus of &s;ix
days old: It was a ball of liquor inclo&s;ed in a
pellicle. The liquor was reddi&s;h; and the
pellicle was inter&s;per&s;ed with red and colourle&s;s
ve&s;&s;els. In the middle of it there was a &s;mall e|minence,
which I apprehended to be the umbi|lical
ve&s;&s;els, by which the foetus receives nou|ri&s;hment
and the &s;pirit of re&s;piration from the
mother. A &s;econd covering or pellicle gradu|ally
forms above the fir&s;t. Abundance of nou|ri&s;hment
is furni&s;hed by the men&s;trual blood,
which coagulates by degrees, and is converted
into fle&s;h. This fle&s;h gradually articulates as it
grows; and the &s;pirit be&s;tows this form upon
it. Every part proceeds to take its proper place;
the &s;olid particles unite together; the moi&s;t
particles a&s;&s;ociate by them&s;elves; every thing
&s;earches for what is analogous to it; and, in
fine, the foetus, by the&s;e cau&s;es and means, is
completely formed.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem is more rational, and le&s;s ob&s;cure
than that of Ari&s;totle; becau&s;e Hippocrates en|deavours
to explain every particular appearance,
and borrows only one general principle from
the philo&s;ophy of his times, namely, that heat
and cold produce &s;pirits, and that the&s;e &s;pirits
have the power of arranging and of be&s;towing
<PB N="86" REF="89">
figure upon matter. He treats his &s;ubject more
like a phy&s;ician than a philo&s;opher; but Ari&s;totle
explains the phaenomena of generation more as
a metaphy&s;ician than a naturali&s;t. It is for this
rea&s;on that the errors of Hippocrates are parti|cular
and le&s;s apparent, and that tho&s;e of Ari&s;|totle
are general and evident.</P>
<P>The&s;e two great men have each had their fol|lowers.
Almo&s;t all the philo&s;ophers of the
&s;chools adopted Ari&s;totle's theory of generation,
while mo&s;t phy&s;icians adhered to the theory of
Hippocrates; and, in this manner, 17 or 18 cen|turies
pa&s;&s;ed without the appearance of any thing
new upon this my&s;terious &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, upon the revival of literature, &s;ome a|natomi&s;ts
began to inve&s;tigate the nature of gene|ration;
and Fabricius ab Aquapendente was the
fir&s;t who thought of making a cour&s;e of experi|ments
upon the impregnation and expan&s;ion of
the eggs of fowls, the &s;ub&s;tance of which we
&s;hall lay before the reader.</P>
<P>He di&s;tingui&s;hes the matrix of a hen into
two parts, the one &s;uperior, and the other infe|rior.
The &s;uperior part, which he calls the
ovarium, is an a&s;&s;emblage of a great number of
&s;mall yellow eggs, of a round figure, the &s;izes
of which vary from that of a mu&s;tard &s;eed to
that of a walnut. The&s;e eggs are attached to
one another by foot-&s;talks, and the whole &s;ome|what
re&s;embles a bunch of grapes. The &s;malle&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="90">
eggs are white, and they turn yellower in pro|portion
as they increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Having examined tho&s;e yellow eggs imme|diately
after a communication with the male, he
could perceive no &s;en&s;ible difference; he &s;aw
none of the male &s;emen in any part of the eggs:
He therefore concluded, that the whole eggs,
and even the ovarium it&s;elf, were rendered fer|tile
by a &s;ubtile &s;pirit which i&s;&s;ues from the male
&s;emen; and, he adds, that, in order to prevent
the e&s;cape of this fecundating &s;pirit, nature has
placed, at the external orifice of the vagina of
birds, a membranous valve which permits the
&s;eminal &s;pirit to enter freely into the vagina,
but prevents its return.</P>
<P>When an egg is detached from the common
pedicle, it gradually de&s;cends, through a wind|ing
canal, into the inferior part of the matrix.
This canal is filled with a liquor very &s;imilar to
the white of an egg. It is here that the egg
receives its white liquor, the membrane in which
it is inclo&s;ed, the two cords (<HI>chalazae</HI>) that run
through the white, and join it to the yolk, and
the &s;hell which is &s;uddenly formed immediately
before exclu&s;ion. The&s;e cords, according to
our author, are the part of the egg which is im|pregnated
by the &s;eminal &s;pirit of the male; and
it is here al&s;o that the rudiments of the foetus
fir&s;t appear. The egg is not only the true ma|trix,
or the place where the chick is formed, but
the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of generation depends upon
<PB N="88" REF="91">
it. The egg is the great agent in generation;
it furni&s;hes both the matter and the organs.
The &s;ub&s;tance of the cords is the matter of
which the chick is formed; the white and the
yok afford it nouri&s;hment; and the &s;eminal &s;pi|rit
of the male is the efficient cau&s;e. This &s;pirit
communicates to the cords, fir&s;t, an alterant
quality, then a forming quality, and, la&s;tly, a
power of augmenting, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations of Fabricius, it is apparent,
lead not to any clear idea of generation. At the
&s;ame time that this anatomi&s;t was making his
experiments, which was about the middle of the
&s;ixteenth century, the famous Aldrovandus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Ornithologia.</NOTE>
made &s;ome remarks upon eggs. But, as Har|vey
properly ob&s;erves of him, he followed more
the authority of Ari&s;totle than of experiment.
The de&s;cription he gives of the chick in the egg
is by no means exact. Volcher Coiter, one of
his pupils, &s;ucceeded better than his ma&s;ter; this
writer, together with Pari&s;anus, a Venetian phy|&s;ician,
have each given de&s;criptions of the chick
in the egg, which Harvey prefers to all the o|thers.</P>
<P>This celebrated anatomi&s;t, who fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed
the circulation of the blood, has given an ex|cellent
treati&s;e on generation. He flouri&s;hed
about the middle of la&s;t century, and was phy|&s;ician
to Charles I. of England. As he was o|bliged
to follow this unhappy Prince during his
<PB N="89" REF="92">
misfortunes, he lo&s;t, among other papers, what
he had written concerning the generation of in|&s;ects;
and it appears, that he compo&s;ed from
memory his treati&s;e on the generation of birds
and of quadrupeds. I &s;hall give a &s;hort view of
his remarks, of his experiments, and of his the|ory.</P>
<P>Harvey alledges, that men, and all other ani|mals,
proceed from eggs; that, in viviparous a|nimals,
the fir&s;t produce of conception is a kind
of egg; and that the only difference between
the viviparous and oviparous is, that, in the for|mer,
the foetu&s;es begin to exi&s;t, increa&s;e, and
acquire their full growth in the uterus; but that,
in the oviparous animals, the foetu&s;es begin to
exi&s;t in the body of the mother, where they are
in the form of eggs; and it is only after their
exclu&s;ion that they become real foetu&s;es. And
it de&s;erves to be remarked, &s;ays he, that, in ovi|parous
animals, &s;ome retain their eggs till they
be perfect, as birds, &s;erpents, and oviparous qua|drupeds;
and that others exclude their eggs be|fore
they are perfect, as fi&s;hes, cru&s;taceous, and
te&s;taceous animals. The eggs laid by tho&s;e crea|tures
are only the rudiments of eggs, which af|terwards
acquire membranes and a white, and
attract nouri&s;hment from the matter with which
they are &s;urrounded. There are even, he adds,
in&s;ects, caterpillars, for example, which are only
imperfect eggs; they &s;earch for their nouri&s;h|ment,
and, at the end of a certain time, they ar|rive
<PB N="90" REF="93">
at the &s;tate of a chry&s;alis, which is a perfect
egg. Another difference may &s;till be remarked
in oviparous animals: The eggs of hens, and
other birds, are of all different &s;izes; but tho&s;e
of fi&s;hes, frogs, &amp;c. who lay them before they
are perfect, are all of the &s;ame &s;ize. He indeed
ob&s;erves, that, in pigeons, who lay two eggs, all
the &s;mall eggs that remain in the ovarium are of
the &s;ame bulk; and that the two only which are
next to be excluded exceed the &s;ize of the re&s;t.
The &s;ame thing happens in cartilaginous fi&s;hes,
as in the ray, which only brings to maturity two
eggs at a time, all the re&s;t being of different
&s;izes, like tho&s;e of the hen.</P>
<P>He next de&s;cribes anatomically the parts ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to generation; and remarks, that the &s;i|tuation
of the anus and vulva in birds differ from
tho&s;e of all other animals, the anus being placed
before, and the vulva behind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of the&s;e facts are taken from Ari&s;totle.</NOTE>. And, with
regard to the cock, and all &s;mall birds, he al|ledges,
that they have no proper penis, and that
they generate by rubbing, without any intro|mi&s;&s;ion.
But male-ducks, gee&s;e, and o&s;triches,
are amply provided with this in&s;trument.</P>
<P>Hens produce eggs without the intervention
of the cock; but, though perfect, they are
fewer in number, and unfertile. He credits
not the common opinion, that a few days inter|cour&s;e
with the cock are &s;ufficient to impregnate
all the eggs which a hen will lay during the year;
<PB N="91" REF="94">
but he acknowledges, that he &s;eparated a hen
from the cock for 20 days, and that all the eggs
&s;he laid were fecundated. As long as the egg
remains attached to the ovarium, it is nouri&s;hed
by the ve&s;&s;els of the common pedicle; but, when
it &s;eparates from this pedicle, it receives the
white liquor and the &s;hell from the matter with
which the canal of the uterus is filled.</P>
<P>The two cords (<HI>chalazae</HI>) which Aquapen|dente
con&s;idered to be the germ, or part produ|ced
by the male &s;emen, are found in unimpreg|nated,
as well as impregnated eggs; and Harvey
properly ob&s;erves, that the&s;e parts neither pro|ceed
from the male, nor receive the impregna|tion.
The part of the egg which receives the
impregnation is a &s;mall white circle &s;ituated up|on
the membrane that covers the yolk, and has
the appearance of a cicatrice about the &s;ize of a
lentil. Harvey likewi&s;e remarks, that this ci|catrice
is found in all eggs, whether they be fe|cundated
or not; and that tho&s;e are deceived who
imagine it to be produced by the &s;eed of the
male. It is of the &s;ame &s;ize and form in fre&s;h
eggs as in tho&s;e which have been long kept.
But, as &s;oon as the proce&s;s of hatching is begun,
whether by means of artificial heat, or by the heat
of the hen, this &s;mall mark or cicatrice gradual|ly
augments and dilates like the pupil of the
eye. This is the fir&s;t change, and it is vi&s;ible
after a few hours incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95">
When the egg has been heated for 24 hours,
the yolk, which was formerly in the centre,
ri&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the cavity at the thick end of the
egg This cavity continues to enlarge by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of the more fluid part of the white;
and the heavie&s;t part of the white falls down to
the &s;mall end. The cicatrice or &s;peck on the
membrane of the yolk, is elevated along with
it, and applies it&s;elf to the membrane which
lines the cavity at the thick end. This &s;peck
is now as large as a pea; and a white point is
di&s;tingui&s;hable in the middle of it, with &s;everal
circles, of which this point appears to be the
common centre.</P>
<P>At the end of the &s;econd day, the&s;e circles are
larger and more con&s;picuous, and they divide the
&s;peck &s;ometimes into two, and &s;ometimes into three
parts, of different colours. A &s;mall external pro|tuberance
likewi&s;e appears, which nearly re&s;em|bles
a little eye, with a white point or cataract
on the pupil. Between the circles a liquor, as
tran&s;parent as cry&s;tal, is contained by means of
a very thin membrane. The &s;peck, which is
now become a kind of bubble, or liquid globe,
appears as if it were &s;ituated in the white, rather
than on the membrane of the yolk. On the third
day the tran&s;parent liquor, as well as the mem|brane
in which it is inclo&s;ed, is con&s;iderably aug|mented.
On the 4th, a &s;mall line of blood, of
a purple colour, appears on the circumference of
the bubble; and, at a little di&s;tance from the
<PB N="93" REF="96">
centre, we perceive a dot or point, of a bloody
colour, which beats like a heart. It is vi&s;ible at
every dia&s;tole, and di&s;appears during the &s;y&s;tole.
From this animated point two &s;mall blood-ve&s;&s;els
i&s;&s;ue, and terminate in the membrane which con|tains
the tran&s;parent cry&s;talline liquor. The&s;e
blood-ve&s;&s;els &s;et off from the &s;ame place, nearly
in the &s;ame manner as the roots of a tree &s;et off
from the trunk; and it is in the angle which
the&s;e roots form with the trunk, and in the mid|dle
of the liquor, that the animated point is &s;i|tuated.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the fourth, or beginning
of the fifth day, the animated point is &s;o much
enlarged, that it has the appearance of a &s;mall
bladder filled with blood; and, by its contractions
and dilatations, it is alternately filled and emp|tied.
On the &s;ame day we di&s;tinctly perceive,
that this bladder is divided into two parts, each of
which dilates and contracts in the &s;ame manner.
Round the &s;horte&s;t of the blood-ve&s;&s;els de&s;cribed
above, a kind of cloud appears, which, though
tran&s;parent, ob&s;cures the view of the ve&s;&s;el. E|very
hour this cloud becomes thicker; it attach|es
it&s;elf to the root of the blood-ve&s;&s;el, and &s;eems
to depend from it like a &s;mall globe. This globe
extends and appears to divide into three parts,
one of which is globular, and larger than the o|ther
two; and here we perceive the rudiments
of two eyes, and of the whole head: And, at
the end of the fifth day, we &s;ee, in the remain|der
of this lengthened globe, the beginnings of
the vertebrae.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">
On the &s;ixth day, the parts of the head are
more apparent. We di&s;tingui&s;h the coats of the
eyes, the thighs, and wings; and then the liver,
the lungs, and the beak. The foetus now begins
to move and to &s;tretch out its head, though no|thing
but the vi&s;cera are yet formed; for the
thorax, the abdomen, and all the external co|verings
of the fore part of the body, are &s;till
wanting. At the end of this day, or the begin|ning
of the &s;eventh, the claws begin to be vi|&s;ible;
the chick opens and moves its beak; and
the anterior parts of the body begin to cover the
vi&s;cera. On the &s;eventh day, the chick is en|tirely
formed; and, from this time till it i&s;&s;ues
from the egg, nothing happens but an expan&s;ion
of all the parts it acquired during the fir&s;t &s;even
days. The feathers appear on the 14th or 15th
day; and, on the 21&s;t, it e&s;capes from the egg,
by breaking the &s;hell with its bill.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments of Harvey appear to have
been made with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s and fide|lity.
In the &s;equel, however, we &s;hall demon|&s;trate
their imperfection, and that the author has
probably fallen into the common error of ma|king
experiments, with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h his fa|vourite
hypothe&s;is, that the fir&s;t animated point
which appeared was the heart. But, before pro|ceeding
to this object, it is proper to give an ac|count
of his other experiments.</P>
<P>Every body knows the many experiments of
Harvey made upon female deer. They receive
<PB N="95" REF="98">
the male about the middle of September. A
few days after copulation, the <HI>horns</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two fle&s;hy proce&s;&s;es, one of which i&s;&s;ues from each &s;ide of the <HI>fundus uteri,</HI> in the form of little <HI>horns,</HI> and are remarkable in &s;ome quadrupeds.</NOTE> of the ute|rus
appear to be thicker and more fle&s;hy than
u&s;ual: They are, at the &s;ame time, more lax and
flabby; and, in each of their cavities, five ca|runculae,
or &s;oft warts, appear. About the 26th
or 28th of September, the uterus is &s;till thicker;
the five carunculae are &s;welled nearly to the &s;ize
and form of a nur&s;e's nipple. On opening them
with a &s;calpel, they appeared to be filled with an
infinite number of white points. Harvey pre|tends
to have remarked, that, neither now, nor
immediately after copulation, had the ovarium
&s;uffered any change; and that he never could
di&s;cover, after repeated trials, the lea&s;t drop of
male &s;emen in the uterus.</P>
<P>Towards the end of October, or the beginning
of November, when the females were &s;eparated
from the males, the thickne&s;s of the <HI>horns</HI> began
to dimini&s;h; the internal &s;urfaces of their cavi|ties
were &s;welled, and &s;eemed to be glued toge|ther.
The carunculae &s;till remained; and the
whole re&s;embled the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain, be|ing
&s;o &s;oft that it could not be touched. Har|vey
tells us, that on the 13th or 14th of Novem|ber,
he perceived filaments, like tho&s;e of a &s;pi|der's
web, which traver&s;ed the cavities of the
<HI>horns,</HI> and even that of the uterus it&s;elf. The&s;e
filaments aro&s;e from the &s;uperior angle of the
<PB N="96" REF="99">
<HI>horns,</HI> and, by their number, formed a kind of
membrane or empty coat. A day or two after|wards,
this coat or &s;ac was filled with a white,
aqueous, vi&s;cid matter, and adhered to the ute|rus
by means of a &s;pecies of mucilage; and the
adhe&s;ion was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible at the &s;uperior part of
the uterus, where the rudiments of the placenta
began then to appear. In the third month, this
&s;ac contained an embryo of two fingers breadth
in length, and al&s;o an internal &s;ac, called the
amnios, inclo&s;ing a tran&s;parent cry&s;talline liquor,
in which the foetus &s;wam. The foetus, at
fir&s;t, was only an animated point, like what ap|peared
in the hen's egg. Every thing now pro|ceeded
and terminated in the &s;ame manner as
de&s;cribed with regard to the chick, with this on|ly
difference, that the eyes of the chick appear|ed
much &s;ooner than tho&s;e of the deer. The a|nimated
point was vi&s;ible about the 19th or 20th
of November. A day or two afterwards, the
oblong body, which contained the rudiments of
the foetus, made its appearance. In &s;ix or &s;even
days more, the foetus was &s;o compleatly formed,
that all its members, and even its &s;ex, were di|&s;tingui&s;hable.
But the heart and vi&s;cera were
&s;till bare; and it was not till a day or two after,
that they were covered with the abdomen and
thorax. This is the la&s;t work, the &s;lating of the
edifice.</P>
<P>From the&s;e experiments upon hens and deer,
Harvey concludes, that all female animals have
<PB N="97" REF="100">
eggs; that in the&s;e eggs a &s;eparation of a tran&s;pa|rent
cry&s;talline liquor, contained in a &s;ac (<HI>amnios</HI>),
takes place, and that another external &s;ac (<HI>chorion</HI>)
inclo&s;es the whole liquors of the egg; that the
fir&s;t thing which appears in the cry&s;talline li|quor
is an animated &s;anguineous point; and, fi|nally,
that the formation of viviparous animals
is effected in the &s;ame manner with that of the
oviparous: The following is the account which
he gives of the generation of both.</P>
<P>Generation, he ob&s;erves, is an operation of the
uterus alone; for not a drop of the male &s;emen
ever enters it. The uterus conceives by a kind
of contagion, communicated to it by the &s;emen
of the male, nearly in the &s;ame manner as the
load-&s;tone communicates a magnetic virtue to
iron. This male contagion acts not only on the
uterus, but on the whole body of the female,
which is entirely fecundated, though the uterus
alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the faculty of conception, in the
&s;ame manner as the brain has the &s;ole power of
conceiving ideas. The ideas conceived by the
brain are &s;imilar to the images of the objects
tran&s;mitted to it by the &s;en&s;es; and the foetus,
which may be regarded as the idea of the uterus,
is &s;imilar to that which produces it. This is the
rea&s;on why children re&s;emble their fathers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I will follow the &s;y&s;tem of our anatomi&s;t no
farther: What has been &s;aid is &s;ufficient to en|able
the reader to judge of it. But we have re|marks
of importance to make concerning his
<PB N="98" REF="101">
experiments. He has repre&s;ented them in a
manner the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and in&s;inuating. He
appears to have often repeated them, and to have
taken every nece&s;&s;ary precaution to avoid fallacy
and deception; and, of cour&s;e, we are led to
think that he has &s;een every thing which po&s;&s;i|bly
could be di&s;covered. Uncertainty and ob|&s;curity,
however, are perceptible in his de&s;crip|tions.
His ob&s;ervations are related from memo|ry;
and he &s;eems, though he often maintains
the contrary, to have made Ari&s;totle, more than
experience, his guide; for he has &s;een every
thing in eggs, and very little more, than was
mentioned by that philo&s;opher. That the mo&s;t
material of his ob&s;ervations were made long be|fore
his own time, we &s;hall be convinced by at|tending
to what follows.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle knew, that the cords (chalazae) in
eggs were of no u&s;e in the generation of the
chick: 'Quae ad principium lutei grandines
haerent, nil conferunt ad generationem, ut qui|dam
&s;u&s;picantur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. 6. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.' Pari&s;anus, Volcher Coiter,
Aquapendente, &amp;c. had remarked the &s;mall ci|catrice,
as well as Harvey. Aquapendente be|lieved
it to be of no u&s;e; but Pari&s;anus main|tained
that it was formed by the male &s;emen,
or, at lea&s;t, that the white point in the middle
of the cicatrice was the &s;emen of the male, and
that it was the rudiments of the foetus, 'E&s;tque,'
&s;ays he, 'illud galli &s;emen alba et tenui&s;&s;ima tu|nica
<PB N="99" REF="102">
abductum, quod &s;ub&s;tat duabus communi|bus
toti ovo membranis,' &amp;c. Hence the only
di&s;covery proper to Harvey is his having re|marked
the exi&s;tence of this cicatrice, both in
fecundated and unfecundated eggs; for the o|ther
writers had ob&s;erved, as well as he, the di|latation
of the circles, and the growth of the
white point. The&s;e are all the remarks Harvey
has made in his account of the two fir&s;t days of
incubation; what he mentions concerning the
third day is only a repetition of what Ari&s;totle
delivers in the &s;ixth book and fourth chapter of
his hi&s;tory of animals: 'Per id tempus a&s;cendit
jam vitellus ad &s;uperiorem partem ovi acutio|rem,
ubi et principium ovi e&s;t et foetus exclu|ditur;
corque ip&s;um apparet in albumine &s;an|guinei

<P>Harvey, becau&s;e Ari&s;totle &s;ays that the yolk
ri&s;es to the &s;mall end of the egg, concludes that
he had &s;een nothing him&s;elf, but had received
his information from &s;ome other pretty accurate
ob&s;erver. In this accu&s;ation, Harvey evidently
injures Ari&s;totle; for the ri&s;ing of the yolk to
either end, &s;olely depends upon its po&s;ition du|ring
the time of incubation; for the yolk, being
lighter than the white, uniformly mounts to the
top, whether the large or the &s;mall end of the
egg be uppermo&s;t. This ob&s;ervation we owe to
William Langley, a phy&s;ician in Dordrecht, who
made experiments on the hatching of eggs in the
year 1655, about 20 years before Harvey's
time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Langly ob&s;erv. editae a Ju&s;to Schradero, Am&s;t. 1674.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, to return to the pa&s;&s;age we have quoted.
It is apparent, that the cry&s;talline liquor, the
animated point, the two circles, the two blood-ve&s;&s;els,
&amp;c. are de&s;cribed by Ari&s;totle in the &s;ame
manner as they were &s;een by Harvey. This
anatomi&s;t maintains, that the animated point is
the heart, that the heart is the fir&s;t part of the
foetus which is formed, and that the vi&s;cera and
other members &s;ucceed. All this has been men|tioned
by Ari&s;totle, and &s;een by Harvey; and
yet it is by no means con&s;onant to truth. To be
a&s;&s;ured of this fact, we have only to repeat the
&s;ame experiments, or to read with attention tho&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="104">
of Malpighius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malpighii pullus in ovo.</NOTE>, which were made about 50
years after the trials of Harvey.</P>
<P>Malpighius carefully examined the cicatrice,
which is the e&s;&s;ential part of the egg; he found
that it was large in impregnated eggs, and &s;mall
in tho&s;e which had received no impregnation;
and he di&s;covered, that, in eggs which had ne|ver
been &s;it upon, the white point, mentioned by
Harvey as the fir&s;t part that becomes animated,
is a &s;mall pur&s;e or bubble &s;wimming in the li|quor
bounded by the fir&s;t circle; and that the
embryo is vi&s;ible in the centre of this pur&s;e.
The membrane of the pur&s;e, which is the am|nios,
being exceedingly thin and tran&s;parent,
allowed him to &s;ee di&s;tinctly the foetus within
it. Malpighius, from this fir&s;t ob&s;ervation, con|cludes
with propriety, that the foetus exi&s;ts in
the egg before incubation, and that the rudi|ments
of the embryo are even then deeply rooted.
It is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention how much this ex|periment
differs from the opinion of Harvey;
for he had ob&s;erved nothing begun to be formed
during the two fir&s;t days of incubation; and, in
his e&s;timation, the fir&s;t ve&s;tige of a foetus is the
animated point, which appears not till the third
day. But Malpighius di&s;covered that the rudi|ments
of the whole foetus exi&s;t before incuba|tion
is commenced.</P>
<P>After a&s;certaining this important fact, Mal|pighius
proceeded to examine the cicatrice of
unimpregnated eggs, which, as formerly re|marked,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
is &s;maller than in tho&s;e that have received
an impregnation. Its margin is often irregular,
and its texture &s;ometimes differs in different eggs.
Near its centre, in place of a bubble including
the foetus, there is a globular mole or unorgani|zed
ma&s;s, which, when opened, pre&s;ents nothing
like regularity or arrangement of parts: It has
only &s;ome appendages filled with a thick but
tran&s;parent liquor; and this unformed ma&s;s is
&s;urrounded and enveloped in &s;everal concentric
circles.</P>
<P>After &s;ix hours incubation, the cicatrice is con|&s;iderably
enlarged; and, in its centre, a bubble
or globule formed by the amnios is ea&s;ily di|&s;tingui&s;hable.
This globule is filled with a fluid,
in the middle of which the head and back-bone
of the chick vi&s;ibly appear. Six hours after
this, every thing is enlarged, and, of cour&s;e,
more apparent to the eye. In &s;ix hours more,
that is, 18 hours after the commencement of in|cubation,
the head is larger, and the &s;pine is
lengthened; and, at the end of 24 hours, the
head of the chick appears in a bended po&s;ture,
and the &s;pine is of a whiti&s;h colour. The ver|tebrae
are ranged on each &s;ide of the &s;pine, like
&s;mall globules; and, nearly at the &s;ame time,
the wings begin to &s;prout, and the head, neck,
and brea&s;t, are lengthened. At the end of 30
hours, nothing new appears; but all the parts
are enlarged, and e&s;pecially the amnios. Round
this membrane, may be remarked the umbilical
<PB N="103" REF="106">
ve&s;&s;els, which are of a dark colour. In 38 hours,
the chick has acquired more &s;trength; its head
is very large, and three ve&s;icles appear in it &s;ur|rounded
with membranes, which likewi&s;e in|clude
the &s;pine of the back, through which,
however, the vertebrae are &s;till vi&s;ible. At the
end of 40 hours, it was admirable to ob&s;erve,
continues our author, the chick living in the
centre of the liquor of the amnios. The back-bone
was increa&s;ed, the head was bended, the
ve&s;icles of the brain were le&s;s bare, the rudi|ments
of the eyes appeared, the heart beat, and
the blood circulated. Here Malpighius de&s;cribes
ve&s;&s;els and the circulation of the blood; and he
thought, with rea&s;on, that, though the heart did
not beat till 38 or 40 hours after incubation was
begun, it neverthele&s;s exi&s;ted before, as well as
the other parts of the chick. But, on exami|ning
the heart in a dark chamber, he ob&s;erved
nothing like luminous &s;parks i&s;&s;uing from it, as
Harvey &s;eems to in&s;inuate.</P>
<P>At the end of the &s;econd day, the foetus ap|peared
&s;wimming in the liquor of the amnios;
the head, which &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of ve|&s;icles,
was bended; the back-bone and verte|brae
were lengthened; the heart, which hung
out of the brea&s;t, beat three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively,
becau&s;e the fluid it contains is pu&s;hed from the
auricle into the ventricles, from the ventricles
into the arteries, and, la&s;tly, into the umbilical
ve&s;&s;els. He remarks, that, having &s;eparated the
<PB N="104" REF="107">
chick from the white of the egg, the motion of
the heart continued for a whole day. In 14
hours more, or 62 hours from the beginning of
the incubation, the chick, though &s;tronger, re|mained
&s;till with its head bended in the liquor
of the amnios: Veins and arteries were perceived
among the ve&s;&s;els of the brain; and the linea|ments
of the eyes, and of the &s;pinal marrow, ap|peared.
At the end of three days, the body of the
chick was crooked. Be&s;ide the two eyes, five
ve&s;icles filled with liquor appeared in the head;
the rudiments of the thighs and of the wings
were di&s;cernible; the body began to take on
fle&s;h; and the pupils of the eyes, and likewi&s;e
the cry&s;talline and vitreous humours, were di&s;|tingui&s;hable.
At the termination of the fourth
day, the ve&s;icles of the brain were nearer each
other; the proce&s;&s;es of the vertebrae were long|er;
the wings and the thighs had become &s;trong|er,
in proportion as they grew longer; the whole
body was covered with an unctuous fle&s;h; the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els had pierced through the abdo|men;
and the heart was concealed within the
brea&s;t, which was now &s;hut up by a thin mem|brane.
On the fifth, and at the end of the &s;ixth
day, the ve&s;icles of the brain began to be covered;
the &s;pinal marrow, which was now more &s;olid,
was divided into two parts, and advanced along
the trunk; the thighs and wings were longer,
and the wings were unfolded; the abdomen was
&s;hut and tumified; the liver was di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible,
<PB N="105" REF="108">
and of a dark colour; the two ventricles of the
heart beat; the body of the chick was covered
with &s;kin; and the points of the feathers began
to appear. On the &s;eventh day, the head was
very large; the brain was covered with its mem|branes;
the beak appeared between the two
eyes; the wings, the thighs, and the legs, had
acquired their perfect form; the heart &s;eemed
to be compo&s;ed of two ventricles, like two con|tiguous
globules, united at their &s;uperior part
with the auricles; and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pul&s;es were
remarked both in the ventricles and auricles, as
if there had been two &s;eparate hearts.</P>
<P>But I will follow Malpighius no farther. The
remainder of the detail regards the growth and
perfection of the parts till the chick breaks the
&s;hell in which it is inclo&s;ed, and becomes an in|habitant
of a new world. The heart is the la&s;t
part that a&s;&s;umes its proper figure, by the union
of its ventricles, which happens not till the e|leventh
day.</P>
<P>We are now in a condition to form a di&s;tinct
judgment concerning the value of Harvey's ex|periments.
It is probable that this celebrated
anatomi&s;t did not make u&s;e of the micro&s;cope,
(which was, indeed, very imperfectly known in
his days), otherwi&s;e he never would have affirm|ed,
that there was no difference between the
cicatrice of impregnated and unimpregnated
eggs; he never would have &s;aid, that the &s;emen
of the male produced no change upon the egg,
<PB N="106" REF="109">
and particularly upon the cicatrice; he never
would have advanced, that nothing was percep|tible
before the end of the third day; that the
animated point appeared fir&s;t; and that the white
point was transformed into the animated point:
He would have perceived that the white point
was the bubble or globule which contained the
whole apparatus of generation; and that all the
rudiments of the foetus commenced there from
the moment of receiving the impregnation of
the cock: He would likewi&s;e have di&s;covered,
that, without this impregnation, it contains no|thing
but an unformed ma&s;s, which could never
become animated; becau&s;e, in fact, it is not
organized like an animal, and becau&s;e it is only
after this ma&s;s, which ought to be regarded as a
collection of the organic particles of the female
&s;emen, is penetrated by the organic particles of
the male &s;emen, that an animal is formed. This
formation is in&s;tantaneous; but the motions of
the new animal are imperceptible till 40 hours
after the proce&s;s of incubation has commenced:
He would not have a&s;&s;ured us, that the heart is
fir&s;t formed, and that the other parts are &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
joined to it by juxta-po&s;ition; &s;ince it is
apparent, from the experiments of Malpighius,
that the rudiments of all the parts are formed at
once, but that they become perceptible only in
proportion as they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively unfolded:
La&s;tly, if he had &s;een, as Malpighius &s;aw, he
would not have po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that no im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="107" REF="110">
of the male &s;eed remained in the eggs,
and that it was only by contagion that they
were impregnated, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o proper to remark, that what Harvey
has &s;aid concerning the parts of generation of
the cock is by no means exact. He affirms,
that the cock has no penis capable of entering
the vagina of the hen. It is certain, however,
that this animal, in place of one penis, has a
couple, which both act at the &s;ame time; and
this action is a vigorous compre&s;&s;ion, if not an
actual copulation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Regn. Graaf, p. 242.</NOTE>. It is by this double organ
that the cock throws his &s;eminal liquor into the
uterus of the hen.</P>
<P>Let us now compare Harvey's experiments
upon female deer with tho&s;e of de Graaf upon
female rabbits; and, though de Graaf believed,
as Harvey did, that all animals proceed from
eggs, we &s;hall find a very great difference in the
manner in which the&s;e two anatomi&s;ts have per|ceived
the fir&s;t formation, or rather the expan|&s;ion,
of the foetu&s;es of viviparous animals.</P>
<P>After exerting every effort to prove, by ar|guments
drawn from comparative anatomy, that
the te&s;ticles of viviparous females are true ova|ria,
Graaf explains the manner in which the
eggs are detached from the ovaria, and fall into
the <HI>horns</HI> of the uterus; and then he relates the
remarks he made upon a rabbit which he di&s;|&s;ected
half an hour after copulation. The horns
<PB N="108" REF="111">
of the uterus, he &s;ays, were uncommonly red;
there was no change either in the ovaria, or in
the eggs which they contained; and there was
not the lea&s;t appearance of &s;emen in the vagina,
in the uterus, or in the <HI>Fallopian tubes.</HI></P>
<P>Having di&s;&s;ected another rabbit, &s;ix hours af|ter
copulation, he ob&s;erved, that the follicles, or
coats, which, in his e&s;timation, contain the eggs
in the ovarium, were become red; but he found
no male &s;emen either in the ovaria or any where
el&s;e. Twenty hours after copulation, he di&s;&s;ect|ed
a third; he remarked in one ovarium three,
and in the other five follicles much altered; for
in&s;tead of being clear and limpid, they were
become opaque and reddi&s;h. In another, di&s;|&s;ected
twenty-&s;even hours after copulation, the
horns of the uterus, and the &s;uperior canals
which terminate in them, were &s;till more red,
and their extremities embraced the ovarium on
all &s;ides. In another, which was opened forty
hours after copulation, he found in one ovarium
&s;even, and in the other three follicles changed.
Fifty-two hours after copulation, he examined
another, and found in one ovarium four changed
follicles, and one in the other; and having open|ed
the&s;e follicles, he di&s;covered in them a kind
of glandular liquor, with a &s;mall cavity in the
middle, where he could perceive no fluid, which
made him &s;u&s;pect that the tran&s;parent liquor
u&s;ually contained in the follicles, and which, he
&s;ays, is inclo&s;ed in its own membranes, might
<PB N="109" REF="112">
have been di&s;charged by &s;ome kind of rupture.
He &s;earched for this matter in the canals which
terminate in the horns of the uterus, and in the
horns them&s;elves; but he found nothing. He
only remarked, that the membranes which line
the horns of the uterus were much &s;welled. In
another rabbit, di&s;&s;ected three days after copu|lation,
he ob&s;erved, that the &s;uperior extremity
of the canal, which terminates in the horns of
the uterus, &s;traitly embraced the ovarium on
every &s;ide: And, having &s;eparated it from the
ovarium, he remarked, in the right ovarium,
three follicles &s;omewhat larger and harder than
u&s;ual. After &s;earching with great care the ca|nals
above mentioned, he di&s;covered, he &s;ays, an
egg in the right canal, and two more in the
right horn of the uterus, &s;o &s;mall that they ex|ceeded
not mu&s;tard &s;eeds. The&s;e little eggs
had each two membranes, and the internal one
was filled with a very limpid liquor. Having
examined the other ovarium, he found four
changed follicles; three of them were whiter,
and had likewi&s;e &s;ome limpid liquor in their
centres; but the fourth was of a darker colour,
and contained no liquor, which made him &s;u&s;|pect
that the egg had e&s;caped from it. He there|fore
&s;earched the corre&s;ponding canal and horn
of the uterus; he found an egg in the &s;uperior
extremity of the horn, which was exactly &s;imi|lar
to tho&s;e he had di&s;covered in the right horn.
He alledges, that the eggs, when they are &s;epa|rated
<PB N="110" REF="113">
from the ovarium, are ten times le&s;s than
before their &s;eparation; and this difference in
&s;ize, he imagines, is owing to the eggs, while in
the ovarium, containing another matter, namely,
the glandulous liquor which he remarked in the
follicles.</P>
<P>Four days after copulation, he opened another
rabbit, and he found in one ovarium four, and
in the other three follicles void of eggs: In the
horns corre&s;ponding to the ovaria, he found four
eggs on one &s;ide, and three in the other. The&s;e
eggs were larger than tho&s;e he had di&s;covered
three days after copulation. They were nearly
of the &s;ize of the lead-&s;hot u&s;ed for &s;hooting
&s;mall birds; and he remarked, that, in the&s;e
eggs, the interior membrane was &s;eparated from
the exterior, and appeared as if a &s;econd egg
was contained within the fir&s;t. In another, di&s;|&s;ected
five days after copulation, he found five
empty follicles in the ovaria, and an equal num|ber
of eggs in the uterus, to which they adhe|red
very firmly. The&s;e eggs were as large as
the &s;hot employed for killing hares, and the in|ternal
membrane was &s;till more apparent than
in the la&s;t experiment. Having opened another
rabbit, &s;ix days after copulation, he found in
one of the ovaria &s;ix empty follicles, but only
five eggs in the corre&s;ponding horn of the ute|rus,
and they &s;eemed to be all accumulated into
one ma&s;s: In the other ovarium, he &s;aw four
empty follicles, and found but one egg in the
<PB N="111" REF="114">
corre&s;ponding horn. The&s;e eggs were of the
&s;ize of the large&s;t fowling &s;hot. Seven days af|ter
copulation, our anatomi&s;t opened another
rabbit, and he found in the ovaria &s;ome empty
follicles, which were larger, harder, and more
red than tho&s;e he had formerly ob&s;erved; and
he perceived as many tran&s;parent tumors in dif|ferent
parts of the uterus; and, having opened
them, he took out the eggs, which were as large
as &s;mall <HI>pi&s;tol</HI> bullets. The internal membrane
was more di&s;tinct than formerly; and within this
membrane he &s;aw nothing but a very clear li|quor.
In another, di&s;&s;ected eight days after co|pulation,
he found in the uterus the tumors or
cells which contain the egg; but they adhered
&s;o &s;trongly to the uterus, that he could not de|tach
them. In another, which he opened nine
days after copulation, he found the cells con|taining
the eggs greatly enlarged, and he per|ceived
in the middle of the liquor inclo&s;ed by
the internal membrane a &s;mall thin cloud. In
another, which he opened ten days after copu|lation,
the &s;mall cloud was thicker and darker,
and formed an oblong body like a little worm.
La&s;tly, twelve days after copulation, he di&s;tinctly
perceived the embryo, which, though two days
before, it was only an oblong body, was now &s;o
apparent, that he could di&s;tingui&s;h its different
members. In the region of the brea&s;t, he &s;aw
two red and two white points, and, in the ab|domen,
a mucilaginous reddi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance. Four|teen
<PB N="112" REF="115">
days after copulation, the head of the foe|tus
was large and tran&s;parent; the eyes were
prominent; the mouth was open; the rudi|ments
of the ears appeared; the back-bone was
whiti&s;h, and bended towards the &s;ternum, and
&s;mall blood-ve&s;&s;els aro&s;e from each &s;ide of it,
the ramifications of which extended along the
back as far as the legs: The two red points
were con&s;iderably enlarged, and appeared like
the rudiments of the ventricles of the heart; on
each &s;ide of the red points he &s;aw two white
ones, which were the rudiments of the lungs.
In the abdomen he &s;aw the rudiments of the li|ver,
which was reddi&s;h, and a &s;mall body twi&s;ted
like a thread, which was the &s;tomach and inte|&s;tines.
After this, till the 31&s;t day, when the
female rabbit brings forth, there was nothing to
be remarked but the gradual expan&s;ion and
growth of the parts which were already formed.</P>
<P>From the&s;e experiments, De Graaf concludes,
that all viviparous females have eggs; that the&s;e
eggs are contained in the ovaria or te&s;ticles;
that they cannot be &s;eparated till they are fecun|dated
by the &s;emen of the male; becau&s;e, &s;ays
he, the glandular liquor, by means of which the
eggs are enabled to e&s;cape from their follicles,
is not &s;ecreted till after an impregnation by the
male. He alledges, that tho&s;e who imagine they
have &s;een pretty large eggs in three days, have been
deceived; becau&s;e, in his opinion, the eggs, though
fecundated, remain longer in the ovarium, and,
<PB N="113" REF="116">
in place of augmenting, they become ten times
le&s;s than formerly, and they never begin to
grow till after their de&s;cent from the ovaria in|to
the uterus.</P>
<P>By comparing the&s;e ob&s;ervations of Graaf
with tho&s;e of Harvey, we will ea&s;ily perceive
that the latter has mi&s;&s;ed the principal facts:
And, though there are &s;everal errors both in the
rea&s;oning and in the experiments of De Graaf,
this anatomi&s;t, as well as Malpighius, have di&s;|covered
them&s;elves to be better ob&s;ervers than
Harvey. They agree in all fundamental points,
and both of them contradict Harvey. He per|ceived
not the alterations which take place in the
ovaria; he &s;aw not in the uterus tho&s;e &s;mall
globules which contain the materials of genera|tion,
and which are called eggs by De Graaf;
he never &s;u&s;pected that the foetus exi&s;ted in this
egg; and, though his experiments give us tole|rably
exact ideas concerning what happens du|ring
the growth of the foetus, he furni&s;hes no
information concerning the commencement of
fecundation, nor concerning the fir&s;t expan&s;ion
of the foetus. Schrader, a Dutch phy&s;ician,
who had a great veneration for Harvey, acknow|ledges
that he cannot be tru&s;ted in many articles,
and particularly in what relates to the fir&s;t for|mation
of the embryo; for the chick really ex|i&s;ts
in the egg before incubation; and, he &s;ays,
that Jo&s;eph of Aromatarius was the fir&s;t who
<PB N="114" REF="117">
made this material ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ob&s;. Ju&s;ti Schraderi, Am&s;t. 1674.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, though
Harvey alledged that all animals proceeded from
eggs, he never imagined that the te&s;ticles of fe|males
contained eggs; and it was only from a
compari&s;on between the &s;ac, which he believed
to be formed in the uterus of viviparous ani|mals,
with the growth and covering of the eggs
in oviparous animals, that he maintained that all
animals were produced from eggs; and even
this is only a repetition of what Ari&s;totle had
&s;aid before him. Steno was the fir&s;t who pre|tended
to have di&s;covered eggs in the ovaria of
females. He &s;ays, that, in di&s;&s;ecting a female
&s;ea-dog, he perceived eggs in the te&s;ticles, though
this animal be viviparous; and he adds, that the
te&s;ticles of women are analogous to the ovaria
of oviparous animals, whether the eggs them|&s;elves
fall into the uterus, or only the matter
which they contain. Steno was the fir&s;t who
di&s;covered the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed eggs; De Graaf is
willing to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;covery to him&s;elf; and
Swammerdam warmly di&s;putes the point with
him, and alledges that Van-Horn had &s;een them
before De Graaf. This la&s;t writer, it is true,
has been accu&s;ed of a&s;&s;erting many things which
have been contradicted by experiments: He
even pretended, that a certain judgment might
be formed of the number of foetu&s;es in the ute|rus,
by the number of cicatrices or empty fol|licles
in the ovaria. In this he is contradicted
<PB N="115" REF="118">
by the experiments of Verrheyen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. chap. 3. edit. De Bruxelles, 1710.</NOTE>, by tho&s;e of
M. Mery<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'acad. 1701.</NOTE>, and by &s;ome of his own, where he
found fewer eggs in the uterus, than cicatrices
in the ovaria. Be&s;ides, we &s;hall demon&s;trate that
what he &s;ays concerning the &s;eparation of the
eggs, and the manner in which they de&s;cend
into the uterus, is by no means exact; that no
eggs exi&s;t in the te&s;ticles of females; that what
is &s;een in the uterus is not an egg; and that the
&s;y&s;tems which have been deduced from the ob|&s;ervations
of this celebrated anatomi&s;t are per|fectly
chimerical.</P>
<P>This pretended di&s;covery of eggs in the te&s;ti|cles
of females attracted the attention of mo&s;t
anatomi&s;ts. They only found, however, in the
te&s;ticles of viviparous females, &s;mall bladders;
tho&s;e they he&s;itated not to con&s;ider as real eggs,
and, therefore, they called the te&s;ticles <HI>ovaria,</HI>
and the ve&s;icles <HI>eggs.</HI> They a&s;&s;erted al&s;o, like
De Graaf, that the&s;e eggs differed in &s;ize in the
&s;ame ovarium; that the large&s;t in the ovaria of
women exceeded not the bulk of a &s;mall pea;
that they are very &s;mall in young girls; but that
they increa&s;ed with age and intercour&s;e with
men; that not above 20 could be reckoned in
each ovarium; that the&s;e eggs are fecundated
in the ovarium by the &s;pirituous part of the
male &s;emen; that they then &s;eparate and fall
into the uterus by the Fallopian tubes, where the
<PB N="116" REF="119">
foetus is formed of the internal &s;ub&s;tance of the
egg, and the placenta of its external part; that
the glandulous matter, which exi&s;ts not in the
ovarium till after a fruitful embrace, compre&s;&s;es
the egg, and excludes it from the ovarium, &amp;c.
But, though Malpighius, who examined mat|ters
more accurately, detected many errors com|mitted
by tho&s;e anatomi&s;ts even before they were
received; yet mo&s;t phy&s;icians adopted the o|pinion
of De Graaf, without regarding the ob|&s;ervations
of Malpighius, which were neverthe|le&s;s
of the greate&s;t importance, and which re|ceived
much weight from the experiments of his
di&s;ciple Vali&s;nieri.</P>
<P>Malpighius and Vali&s;nieri, of all naturali&s;ts,
appear to have written with mo&s;t judgment and
acutene&s;s on the &s;ubject of generation. We
&s;hall, therefore, give an account of their experi|ments
and remarks.</P>
<P>Malpighius, having examined the te&s;ticles of
a number of cows and other female animals,
a&s;&s;ures us, that he found, in the te&s;ticles of all
of them, ve&s;icles of different &s;izes, whether the
females were very young or adults. The&s;e ve|&s;icles
are enveloped in a pretty thick membrane,
the in&s;ide of which is inter&s;per&s;ed with blood-ve&s;&s;els;
and they are filled with a kind of lymph
or liquor, which coagulates and hardens by the
heat of a fire, like the white of an egg.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, a firm yellow body ad|heres
to the te&s;ticles. It is prominent, and in|crea&s;es
<PB N="117" REF="120">
to the &s;ize of a cherry, and occupies the
greate&s;t part of the ovarium. This body con|&s;i&s;ts
of &s;everal angular lobes, the po&s;ition of
which is very irregular, and it is covered with a
coat or membrane inter&s;per&s;ed with nerves and
blood-ve&s;&s;els. The form and appearance of this
yellow body varies con&s;iderably at different
times. When it exceeds not the &s;ize of a grain
of millet, it is roundi&s;h, and its &s;ub&s;tance, when
cut, has a warty appearance. We often find an
external covering round the ve&s;icles of the o|varia,
which con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with
the yellow bodies.</P>
<P>When the yellow body has become nearly of
the &s;ize of a pea, it re&s;embles a pear; and, in the
centre of it, there is a &s;mall cavity filled with
liquor. The &s;ame thing may be remarked when
it is as large as a cherry. In &s;ome of the&s;e
yellow bodies, after they have arrived at full
maturity, Malpighius affirms that he &s;aw, to|wards
the centre, a &s;mall egg with its appen|dages,
about the &s;ize of a millet &s;eed; and, after
they had di&s;charged the&s;e eggs, they were flaccid
and empty. They then re&s;embled a cavernous
canal; and the void cavities were as large as
peas. He conceived that Nature de&s;igned this
yellow glandular body for the pre&s;ervation of
the egg, and for making it e&s;cape from the te|&s;ticles;
and that, perhaps, it contributed to the
formation of the egg; con&s;equently, he remarks,
the ve&s;icles which are at all times found in the
<PB N="118" REF="121">
ovarium, and always differ in &s;ize, are not the
true eggs which receive the impregnation, but
only &s;erve to produce the yellow bodies in which
the eggs are formed. Be&s;ides, though the&s;e yel|low
bodies are not always found in every ova|rium;
yet we always find the rudiments of
them. Malpighius found the marks of them in
new born heifers, in cows with calf, and in preg|nant
women; and, therefore, he properly con|cludes,
that the&s;e yellow glandular bodies are
not, as De Graaf a&s;&s;erts, an effect of impregna|tion.
The yellow bodies, he remarks, produce
unfecundated eggs, which fall out of the ova|rium
independent of any communication with
the male, and al&s;o tho&s;e which fall after impreg|nation.
When the impregnated eggs fall into
the uterus, every thing proceeds in the manner
de&s;cribed by De Graaf.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations of Malpighius demon&s;trate,
that the te&s;ticles of females are not real ovaria;
that the ve&s;icles they contain are not eggs; that
the&s;e ve&s;icles never fall into the uterus; and that
the te&s;ticles, like tho&s;e of males, are only re&s;er|voirs
containing a liquor which may be regarded
as female &s;emen in an imperfect &s;tate. This &s;e|men
is matured in the yellow glandular bodies,
of which it fills the internal cavities, and flows
out after the yellow bodies have acquired their
full &s;ize.</P>
<P>But, before we form a judgment concerning
this important point, we mu&s;t attend to the re|marks
of Vali&s;nieri.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="122">
In the year 1692, Vali&s;nieri began his expe|riments
upon the te&s;ticles of the &s;ow. The te|&s;ticles
of the &s;ow differ from tho&s;e of cows, of
mares, of &s;heep, of &s;he-a&s;&s;es, of female-dogs,
of &s;he-goats, of women, and of mo&s;t viviparous
animals; for they re&s;emble a &s;mall bunch of
rai&s;ins, the grains of which are round and pro|minent
on the out&s;ide; between the&s;e grains are
&s;maller ones, not yet arrived at maturity. The&s;e
grains appear not to be covered with a common
membrane. They are, &s;ays he, analogous to
the yellow bodies ob&s;erved in cows by Malpi|ghius;
they are round, and of a reddi&s;h colour;
their &s;urface is inter&s;per&s;ed with blood-ve&s;&s;els,
like the eggs of viviparous animals; and the
whole grains together form a ma&s;s that is larger
than the ovarium. With a little addre&s;s, the&s;e
grains may be &s;eparated from the ovarium, and
each of them, after &s;eparation, leaves a nitch or
depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e glandular bodies are not of the &s;ame
colour in every &s;ow. In &s;ome they are more
red; in others more clear; and they are of all
&s;izes, from the &s;malle&s;t &s;eed, to that of a rai&s;in.
On opening them, a triangular cavity appears,
filed with a limpid liquor, which coagulates
with heat, and becomes white, like that which
is contained in the ve&s;icles. Vali&s;nieri expected
to find the egg in &s;ome of the&s;e cavities: But in
this he was di&s;appointed; though he made a
careful &s;earch into all the glandular bodies of a
<PB N="120" REF="123">
number of &s;ows, and other animals, he could
never di&s;cover the egg, which Malpighius af|firms
he found once or twice.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e glandular bodies, the ve&s;icles of
the ovarium appeared. They were more or le&s;s
numerous, according as the glandular bodies
were larger or &s;maller; for, in proportion to the
largene&s;s of the glandular bodies, the ve&s;icles
dimini&s;hed. Some ve&s;icles were of the &s;ize of a
lentil, and others exceeded not that of a millet
&s;eed. In the te&s;ticles, when raw, from 20 to
35 ve&s;icles might be reckoned; but, when boiled,
a much greater number appear, and they are &s;o
firmly attached, that they cannot be &s;eparated
without breaking &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Having examined the te&s;ticles of a young &s;ow,
which had never brought forth, he found, as in
the others, the glandular bodies; and their tri|angular
cavities were likewi&s;e filled with lymph;
but he could not di&s;cover any eggs either in the
one or the other. The ve&s;icles of this young
&s;ow were more numerous than in tho&s;e which had
brought forth, or tho&s;e which were impregnated
at the time of examination. In the te&s;ticles of
another &s;ow, which was far advanced in preg|nancy,
Vali&s;nieri found two of the large&s;t glan|dular
bodies, which were flaccid and empty, and
others, of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize, in their ordinary &s;tate;
and, in &s;everal others which he di&s;&s;ected when
with young, he remarked, that the number of
glandular bodies was always greater than the
<PB N="121" REF="124">
number of foetu&s;es. This confirms what we
ob&s;erved concerning the experiments of De Graaf,
and proves that they are by no means exact.
What he calls follicles of the ovarium are only
the glandular bodies, the number of which al|ways
exceeds that of the foetu&s;es. In the ova|ria
of a &s;ow, two or three months old, the te&s;|ticles
were pretty large, and inter&s;per&s;ed with
ve&s;icles of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. Among the ve|&s;icles,
the beginnings of four glandular bodies
appeared in one te&s;ticle, and of &s;even in the
other.</P>
<P>After the&s;e experiments upon &s;ows, Vali&s;nieri
repeats tho&s;e of Malpighius upon cows, and he
found them to be exactly conformable to truth.
He indeed acknowledges, that he was never
able to di&s;cover the egg which Malpighius ima|gined
he had &s;een once or twice in the interior
cavity of the glandular bodies. After a fruitle&s;s
&s;earch in the te&s;ticles of &s;o many different fe|males,
it was natural to think, that Vali&s;nieri
would at lea&s;t have doubted the exi&s;tence of &s;uch
eggs. But prejudice in favour of &s;y&s;tem made
him admit, contrary to his own experience, the
exi&s;tence of eggs, which neither he nor any
other man ever &s;aw, or will &s;ee.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible to make a greater
number, or more exact experiments, than Vali&s;|nieri
has done. Among other animals, he ex|amined
the ewe, and found, that &s;he has never
any more glandular bodies in her te&s;ticles than
<PB N="122" REF="125">
foetu&s;es in the uterus. In young ewes, which
were never impregnated, there is but one glan|dular
body in each te&s;ticle, and, when one is
emptied, it is &s;ucceeded by another; if a ewe
has one foetus in the uterus, &s;he has only one
glandular body in her te&s;ticles; and if &s;he has
two foetu&s;es, &s;he has likewi&s;e two glandular bo|dies.
This glandular body occupies the greate&s;t
part of the te&s;ticle; and, after it is emptied and
di&s;appears, another begins to grow for the pur|po&s;e
of a future generation.</P>
<P>In the te&s;ticles of a &s;he-a&s;s, he found ve&s;icles
as large as &s;mall cherries, which is an evident
proof that they are not eggs, as it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for them to pa&s;s, by the Fallopian tubes,
into the uterus.</P>
<P>The te&s;ticles of female wolves, dogs, and
foxes, are covered with a membrane, like a pur&s;e,
which is an expan&s;ion of that which &s;urrounds
the <HI>horns</HI> of the uterus. In a bitch which began
to be in &s;ea&s;on, but had not been approached by
the male, Vali&s;nieri found the internal part of
this pur&s;e, which does not adhere to the te&s;ticle,
moi&s;tened with a liquor that re&s;embled whey,
and two glandular bodies in the right te&s;ticle,
about two lines in diameter, and which occu|pied
nearly the whole extent of the te&s;ticle.
Each glandular body had a &s;mall nipple, with a
di&s;tinct fi&s;&s;ure, from which, without pre&s;&s;ing it,
there i&s;&s;ued a liquor like clear whey; he there|fore
concluded, that this liquor was the &s;ame
<PB N="123" REF="126">
which he found in the pur&s;e. He blew into this
fi&s;&s;ure with a pipe, and the whole glandular
body immediatly &s;welled; and, having introdu|ced
a bri&s;tle, he ea&s;ily penetrated to the bottom
of it. He opened the body on that &s;ide where
he had introduced the bri&s;tle, and found an in|ternal
cavity which communicated with the
nipple, and contained a con&s;iderable quantity of
liquor. Vali&s;nieri was always in hopes of di&s;|covering
the egg; but the&s;e hopes, notwith&s;tand|ing
all his re&s;earches, were uniformly fru&s;trated.
He likewi&s;e found, in the left te&s;ticle, two glan|dular
bodies very &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the right.
He boiled two of the&s;e glandular bodies, hoping,
that, by this means, he might di&s;cover the egg,
but &s;till without any mea&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Having di&s;&s;ected another bitch four or five
days after &s;he had received the male, he found
in the te&s;ticles three glandular bodies exactly
&s;imilar to the former. He &s;earched every where
for the egg; but he was &s;till di&s;appointed. By
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope, he di&s;covered
the glandular bodies to be a net-work compo&s;ed
of an infinite number of globular ve&s;icles, which
&s;erved to filtre the liquor which i&s;&s;ued through
the nipple.</P>
<P>He then opend another bitch which was not
in &s;ea&s;on, and having tried to introduce air be|tween
the te&s;ticle and the pur&s;e which covered
it, he found that it dilated like a bladder filled
with air. Having removed the pur&s;e, he di&s;co|vered
<PB N="124" REF="127">
two glandular bodies upon the te&s;ticles;
but they had neither nipple nor fi&s;&s;ure, and no
liquor di&s;tilled from them.</P>
<P>In another bitch that had brought forth about
five whelps two months before, he found five
glandular bodies; but they were much dimini&s;h|ed
in &s;ize, and they began to di&s;appear without
leaving any cicatrices; there remained only a
&s;mall cavity in their centre; but it contained no
liquor.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with the&s;e and many other ex|periments,
Vali&s;nieri, who pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired
to di&s;cover this pretended egg, called together
the be&s;t anatomi&s;ts his country afforded, and, a|mong
others, M. Morgagni; and, having open|ed
a young bitch that was for the fir&s;t time in
&s;ea&s;on, and that had been covered three days be|fore,
they examined the ve&s;icles of the te&s;ticles,
the glandular bodies with their nipples, their ca|nals,
and the liquor in their internal cavities;
but they could perceive no eggs. He then, with
the &s;ame intention, made experiments on &s;he-goats,
foxes, cats, a number of mice, &amp;c. In
the te&s;ticles of all the&s;e animals, he uniformly
found the ve&s;icles, and frequently the glandular
bodies with the liquor they contained; but no
egg ever appeared.</P>
<P>In fine, being de&s;irous of examining the te|&s;ticles
of women, he had an opportunity of o|pening
a young country-woman, who had been
&s;ome years married, and who was killed by a
<PB N="125" REF="128">
fall from a tree. Though of a robu&s;t and vigo|rous
con&s;titution, &s;he had never born any chil|dren.
He endeavoured to di&s;cover if the cau&s;e
of her barrenne&s;s exi&s;ted in the te&s;ticles; and
he found that the ve&s;icles were all filled with a
blacki&s;h and corrupted matter.</P>
<P>In a young girl of eighteen years of age, who
had been brought up in a convent, and who had
every appearance of real virginity, he found the
right te&s;ticle a little longer than the left: It was
of an oval figure, and its &s;urface was &s;omewhat
unequal. This inequality was occa&s;ioned by five
or &s;ix ve&s;icles which protruded on the out&s;ide of
the te&s;ticle. One of the&s;e ve&s;icles, which was more
prominent than the re&s;t, he opened, and a quan|tity
of lymph ru&s;hed out of it. This ve&s;icle was
&s;urrounded with a glandular &s;ub&s;tance, in the
&s;hape of a cre&s;cent, and of a reddi&s;h yellow co|lour.
He cut the te&s;ticle tran&s;ver&s;ely, and found
a number of ve&s;icles filled with limpid liquor;
and he remarked, that the Fallopian tube of this
te&s;ticle was redder and &s;omewhat longer than the
other, as he had often ob&s;erved in other animals
when they were in &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The left te&s;ticle was whiter, and its furface
more &s;mooth; for, though &s;ome ve&s;icles were a
little prominent, none of them were in the form
of nipples; they were all &s;imilar to each other,
and the corre&s;ponding Fallopian tube was nei|ther
&s;welled nor red.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">
In the te&s;ticles of a girl, aged five years, he
found the te&s;ticles with their ve&s;icles, their blood-ve&s;&s;els,
and their nerves.</P>
<P>In the te&s;ticles of a woman of &s;ixty years, he
di&s;covered &s;ome ve&s;icles, and the ve&s;tiges of a
glandular &s;ub&s;tance, like large points of an ob|&s;cure
yellowi&s;h brown colour.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e ob&s;ervations, Vali&s;nieri con|cludes,
that the work of generation is carried on
in the female te&s;ticles, which he continued to re|gard
as ovaria, though he never could find any
eggs in them, and though, on the contrary, he
had di&s;covered that the ve&s;icles were not eggs.
He &s;ays, likewi&s;e, that, for the impregnation of
the egg, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the male &s;emen
&s;hould enter the uterus. He &s;uppo&s;es, that the
egg e&s;capes through the nipple of the glandular
body, after being impregnated in the ovarium;
that it then falls into the Fallopian tube; that it
gradually de&s;cends, and at la&s;t attaches it&s;elf to
the uterus: He adds, that he is fully per&s;uaded,
that the egg is concealed in the cavity of the
glandular body, though neither he nor any other
anatomi&s;t was ever able to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>In his e&s;timation, the &s;pirit of the male &s;eed
a&s;cends into the ovarium, penetrates the egg,
and gives motion to the foetus which previou&s;ly
exi&s;ted in it. In the ovarium of the original
mother of mankind, he ob&s;erves, were eggs,
which contained not only all the children &s;he
produced, but of the whole human race. If
<PB N="127" REF="130">
this chain of infinite individuals contained in
one, be incomprehen&s;ible to us, it is entirely
owing to the imbecillity of our minds, of which
we have daily proofs. But it is not, therefore,
le&s;s con&s;onant to truth, that all the animals which
have exi&s;ted, or can exi&s;t, were created at once,
and were all included in their fir&s;t mothers. The
re&s;emblance of children to their parents is owing,
he continues, to the imagination, which acts &s;o
forcibly on the foetus as to produce &s;tains, mon|&s;tro&s;ities,
di&s;order of parts, and extraordinary
concretions, as well as perfect &s;imilarities.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem of eggs, though it explains no|thing,
and has no foundation in Nature, would
have obtained the univer&s;al &s;uffrages of phy&s;i|cians,
if, nearly about the &s;ame time, another
opinion had not &s;prung up, founded upon the
di&s;covery of &s;permatic animals.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery, which we owe to Leeuwen|hoek
and Hart&s;oeker, was confirmed by Andri,
Vali&s;nieri, Bourguet, and many other ob&s;ervers.
I &s;hall relate what has been advanced concern|ing
tho&s;e &s;permatic animals which are found in
the &s;emen of all males. Their number is &s;o
great, that the &s;emen &s;eems to be entirely com|po&s;ed
of them; and Leeuwenhoek pretends to
have &s;een many millions of them in a drop le&s;s
than the &s;malle&s;t grain of &s;and. Though none
of them appear in females, they are found in the
emitted &s;emen of all males, in the te&s;ticles, and
in the ve&s;iculae &s;eminales. When the &s;emen of
<PB N="128" REF="131">
a man is expo&s;ed to a moderate heat, it thickens,
and the motion of all the animalcules is &s;ud|denly
&s;topped. But, when allowed to cool,
it dilutes, and the animals continue in motion
till the liquor again thickens by evaporating.
The more this fluid is diluted, the number of
animalcules are augmented; and, when greatly
diluted by the addition of water to it, the whole
&s;ub&s;tance of the fluid &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of
animals When the motion of the animalcules
is about to cea&s;e, either on account of heat or of
drying, they appear to approach nearer each
other, to have a common circular motion in the
centre of the &s;mall drop under ob&s;ervation, and
to peri&s;h, all of them, at the &s;ame in&s;tant. But,
when the quantity of liquor is greater, it is ea&s;y
to di&s;tingui&s;h them dying in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e animalcules are &s;aid to be of different
figures in different animals; but they are all
long, thin, without any members, and move
with rapidity in every direction. The fluid in
which they are contained, as formerly remark|ed,
is much heavier than blood. The &s;emen of
a bull, when chemically analyzed by Verrheyen,
yielded fir&s;t phlegm, then a con&s;iderable quan|tity
of foetid oil, a very &s;mall proportion of vo|latile
&s;alt, and more earth than he expected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Verrheyen &s;up. anat. tom. 2. p. 69.</NOTE>.
This author was &s;urpri&s;ed that he could draw no
&s;pirit from the di&s;tillation of this liquor; and,
as he imagined it contained a great quantity of
<PB N="129" REF="132">
&s;pirits, he attributed the evaporation of them to
their &s;ubtility. But may we not &s;uppo&s;e, with
more probability, that it contains little or no
&s;pirits? Neither the con&s;i&s;tence, nor the odor of
this fluid, indicate the pre&s;ence of ardent &s;pirits,
which never abound but in fermented liquors;
and, with regard to volatile &s;pirits, the horns,
bones, and &s;olid parts of animals, afford more of
them than the fluids. What has received the
appellation of &s;eminal &s;pirits, <HI>aura &s;eminalis,</HI> a|mong
anatomi&s;ts, has, perhaps, no exi&s;tence;
and it is certain, that the moving bodies appa|rent
in the &s;eminal fluid, are not agitated by the&s;e
&s;pirits. But, that we may be enabled to pro|nounce
more clearly concerning the nature of
the &s;emen, and of its animalcules, we &s;hall pre|&s;ent
the reader with the principal ob&s;ervations
which have been made on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek, having examined the &s;emen
of a cock, perceived a number of animals &s;imilar
to river eels; but they were &s;o minute, that 50,000
of them were not equal in bulk to a grain of
&s;and. Of tho&s;e in the &s;emen of a rat, it re|quired,
he &s;ays, many millions to make the
thickne&s;s of a hair, &amp;c. This excellent ob&s;er|ver
was per&s;uaded, that the whole &s;ub&s;tance of
the &s;emen was only a ma&s;s of animalcules. He
&s;aw the&s;e animalcules in the &s;emen of men, of
quadrupeds, of birds, of fi&s;hes, and of in&s;ects.
In the &s;emen of a gra&s;s-hopper, the animalcules
were long, and extremely thin. They appeared,
<PB N="130" REF="133">
he &s;ays, to be attached by their &s;uperior end;
and the other end, which he calls their tail, had
a bri&s;k motion, like that of the tail of a &s;erpent
when its head is fixed. In the &s;emen of young
animals, when examined before they have any
&s;exual appetite, he alledges that he &s;aw the &s;ame
minute animals, and that they had no motion:
But, when the &s;ea&s;on of love arrived, the ani|malcules
moved with great vivacity.</P>
<P>In the &s;emen of a male frog, he &s;aw animal|cules;
but, at fir&s;t, they were imperfect, and
had no motion: Some time after, he found them
alive. They were &s;o minute, he ob&s;erves, that
ten thou&s;and of them were only equal in bulk
to a &s;ingle egg of the female.</P>
<P>In the &s;emen of a man and that of a dog, he
pretended to &s;ee two &s;pecies of animalcules, re|&s;embling
males and females. Having &s;hut up
the &s;emen of the dog in a &s;mall vial, he &s;ays,
that a great number of animalcules died the fir&s;t
day; that, on the &s;econd and third day, &s;till
more of them died; and that few of them were
alive on the fourth day. But, having repeated
this experiment on the &s;emen of the &s;ame dog,
he found, at the end of &s;even days, the animal|cules
as bri&s;k and lively as if they had been
newly extracted from the animal: And, having
opened a bitch that, &s;ome time before the expe|riment,
had been three times covered by the &s;ame
dog he could not perceive, with his naked eye,
any male &s;emen in the uterus or its appendages;
<PB N="131" REF="134">
but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope, he found
the &s;permatic animals of the dog in both <HI>horns</HI>
of the uterus: In that part of the uterus which
is neare&s;t the vagina, he di&s;covered great num|bers,
which evidently proves, &s;ays he, that the
male &s;emen enters the uterus, or, at lea&s;t, that
the &s;permatic animals of the dog had arrived
their by their own motion, which enables them
to pa&s;s over 4 or 5 inches in half an hour. In
the uterus of a female rabbit, which had ju&s;t re|ceived
the male, he ob&s;erved an infinite number
of &s;permatic animals. He remarks, that the bo|dies
of the&s;e animals are round; that they have
long tails; and that they often change their fi|gure,
e&s;pecially when the fluid in which they
&s;wim begins to dry up.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments of Leeuwenhoek were re|peated
by &s;everal people, who found them ex|actly
con&s;onant to truth. But Dalenpatius, and
&s;ome others, who were inclined to exceed Leeu|wenhoek
in acutene&s;s of vi&s;ion, alledged that,
in the &s;emen of a man, they not only found a|nimals
re&s;embling tadpoles, who&s;e bodies ap|peared
to be as large as a grain of corn, with
tails about four times as long as their trunks,
and who moved with great agility; but, what
is &s;till more amazing, Dalenpatius &s;aw one of
the&s;e animals break through its coat or covering:
It was then no more an animalcule, but a real
human body, in which he ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="132" REF="135">
the two arms and legs, the brea&s;t and the head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See nouvelles de la republic des lettres, ann. 1699, p. 552.</NOTE>.
But it is apparent, from the very figures, given
by this author, of the embryo which he pretend|ed
to have &s;een e&s;cape from its covering, that
the fact is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. He believed that
he &s;aw what he de&s;cribes; but he was deceived;
for this embryo, according to his de&s;cription, was
more completely formed, at the time of its tran&s;|migration
from the condition of a &s;permatic
worm, than it is in the uterus of the mother at
the end of the fourth or fifth week. Hence
this ob&s;ervation of Dalenpatius, in&s;tead of being
confirmed by future experiments, has been re|jected
by all naturali&s;ts, the mo&s;t acute of whom
have only been able to di&s;cover in the &s;eminal
fluid of man, round or oblong bodies, which ap|pear
to have long tails, but no members of any
kind.</P>
<P>One would be tempted to think that Plato had
been acquainted with tho&s;e &s;permatic animals
which are transformed into men; for, at the
end of his Timacus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 1088, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Ficini.</NOTE>, he &s;ays, 'Vulva quoque

of animals is full of animalcules. Demo|critus
talks of certain worms which a&s;&s;ume the
human figure; and Ari&s;totle tells us, that the
fir&s;t men i&s;&s;ued from the earth in the form of
worms. But neither the authority of Plato, of
Ari&s;totle, of Hippocrates, of Democritus, nor of
Dalenpatius, will ever be able to be&s;tow credi|bility
on a notion which is repugnant to the re|peated
experience and ob&s;ervation of all tho&s;e
who have hitherto made inquiries into this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Vali&s;nieri and Bourguet perceived &s;mall
worms in the &s;emen of a rabbit: One of their
extremities was longer than the other; they were
very active in their motions, and beat the fluid
with their tails: Sometimes they rai&s;ed them|&s;elves
to the top of the liquor, and &s;ometimes
&s;unk to the bottom; at other times they turned
round, and twi&s;ted like &s;erpents: In fine, &s;ays
Vali&s;nieri, I clearly perceived them to be real
animals: 'E gli riconobbi, e gli giudicai &s;enza

in favour of the ovular &s;y&s;tem, admitted
the actual exi&s;tence of &s;permatic animals.</P>
<P>M. Andry pretends, that he could find no a|nimals
in human &s;emen previous to the age of
puberty; that they exi&s;t not in the &s;emen of
very old men; that there are few of them in
tho&s;e who are affected with the venerial di&s;ea&s;e,
and that the&s;e few are in a langui&s;hing &s;tate;
that none of them appear alive in impotent per|&s;ons;
and that the animalcules in the &s;emen of
men have a larger head than tho&s;e of other a|nimals,
which corre&s;ponds, he ob&s;erves, with
the figure of the foetus and infant; and he adds,
that tho&s;e who u&s;e women too frequently have
generally few or no animalcules in their &s;emen.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek, Andry, and others, exerted e|very
effort again&s;t the egg-&s;y&s;tem: They di&s;co|vered
in the &s;emen of all males living animal|cules;
they proved that the&s;e animalcules could
not be regarded &s;imply as inhabitants of this
fluid, &s;ince the quantity of them was larger than
that of the fluid it&s;elf; and &s;ince nothing &s;imi|lar
to them exi&s;ted either in the blood, or in any
other of the animal fluids: They maintained,
that, as females furni&s;hed no animalcules, their
fecundity was &s;olely derived from the males;
that the exi&s;tence of living animals in the &s;e|men
throw more light upon the nature of gene|ration
<PB N="135" REF="138">
than all the former di&s;coveries on this
&s;ubject; becau&s;e the greate&s;t difficulty in genera|tion
is to conceive how life is fir&s;t produced, the
future expan&s;ion and growth of the parts being
only acce&s;&s;ory operations; and, con&s;equently,
that not a doubt remained of the&s;e animalcules
being de&s;tined to become men, or perfect ani|mals,
according to their &s;pecies. When the im|probability
was objected to them, that millions
of animalcules, all equally capable of becoming
men, &s;hould be employed for this purpo&s;e, while
only one of them was to enjoy the &s;ingular ad|vantage
of being admitted into the condition of
humanity; when it was demanded of them,
why this u&s;ele&s;s profu&s;ion of human germs?
they replied, That it corre&s;ponded with the u|&s;ual
magnificence of Nature; that, in plants and
trees, millions of &s;eeds were produced, while only
a few of them &s;ucceeded; and that, therefore,
we ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the prodigious
number of &s;permatic animals. When the ex|treme
minutene&s;s of a &s;permatic worm, com|pared
with the body of a man, was mentioned
to them as a difficulty, they an&s;wered, that the
&s;eeds of trees, of the elm, for example, were e|qually
minute, when compared with the perfect
individuals; and they added, with equal pro|priety,
metaphy&s;ical arguments, by which they
proved, that largene&s;s and minutene&s;s were only
relations, and that the tran&s;ition from &s;mall to
great, or from great to &s;mall, was performed by
<PB N="136" REF="139">
Nature with greater facility than we could po&s;|&s;ibly
imagine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they a&s;ked, are there not fre|quent
examples of the transformation of in|&s;ects?
Do we not daily &s;ee &s;mall aquatic worms,
by &s;imply throwing off their &s;kin or covering,
from which they received their external figure,
transformed into winged animals? May not
&s;permatic animalcules, by a &s;imilar transforma|tion,
become perfect animals? Every thing,
therefore, they conclude, concurs in e&s;tabli&s;hing
this &s;y&s;tem of generation, and in overturning
that which is founded on the notion of eggs;
and, though eggs really exi&s;ted in viviparous
animals, as well as in the oviparous, the&s;e eggs
would only be the matter nece&s;&s;ary for the
growth and expan&s;ion of the &s;permatic worm,
which enters by the pedicle that attaches the
egg to the ovarium, where it finds abundance of
nouri&s;hment prepared for it. All the worms
which are &s;o unfortunate as to mi&s;s this pa&s;&s;age
through the pedicle into the egg, peri&s;h, and that
one alone which finds the proper road, is tran&s;|formed
into a perfect animal. The difficulty of
finding this pa&s;&s;age is &s;ufficient to account for
the great number and apparent profu&s;ion of the
&s;permatic animals. It is a million to one again&s;t
any individual worm's finding this pa&s;&s;age; but,
to compen&s;ate this difficulty, there are more than
a million of worms. When a worm has once
got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an egg, no other can enter into
<PB N="137" REF="140">
it; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the fir&s;t worm &s;huts up the
pa&s;&s;age; or rather, there is a valve at the entry
to the pedicle, which plays while the egg is not
perfectly full; but, when the worm has filled
the egg, this valve will not open, though pu&s;h|ed
by a &s;econd worm. Be&s;ides, this valve is
exceedingly well contrived; for, if the worm
&s;hould chance to de&s;cend through the pa&s;&s;age by
which it entered, the valve prevents its e&s;cape,
and obliges it to remain till it be tran&s;formed.
The &s;permatic worm then becomes a real foetus;
and it is nouri&s;hed by the &s;ub&s;tance of the egg,
and the membranes &s;erve it for a covering; and,
when the nouri&s;hment contained in the egg be|gins
to fail, the foetus attaches it&s;elf to the in|ternal
&s;urface of the uterus, and, by this means,
extracts nouri&s;hment from the blood of the mo|ther,
till, by its weight, and the increa&s;e of its
&s;trength, it at la&s;t breaks off all connection with
the uterus, and i&s;&s;ues into the world.</P>
<P>According to this &s;y&s;tem, it was not the fir&s;t
woman, but the fir&s;t man, who contained all
mankind in his own body. The pre-exi&s;tent
germs are no longer inanimate embryos locked
up in eggs, and included, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> within each
other. They are, on the contrary, &s;mall ani|mals,
or organized living <HI>homunculi,</HI> included in
each other in endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and which, to
render them men, or perfect animals, require
nothing but expan&s;ion, and a transformation &s;i|milar
to that of winged in&s;ects.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141">
As phy&s;icians are at pre&s;ent divided between
the &s;y&s;tem of &s;permatic worms, and that of eggs,
and, as every new writer upon generation has
adopted either the one or the other of the&s;e hy|pothe&s;is,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine them with care,
and to &s;how not only their in&s;ufficiency to ex|plain
the phaenomena of generation, but that
they re&s;t upon &s;uppo&s;itions which are entirely
de&s;titute of probability.</P>
<P>Both &s;y&s;tems &s;uppo&s;e an infinite progre&s;&s;ion,
which, as formerly remarked, is a mere illu&s;ion
of the brain. A &s;permatic worm is more than
a thou&s;and million of times &s;maller than a man.
If, then, the body of a man be taken as an unit,
the body of a &s;permatic worm will be expre&s;&s;ed
by the fraction 1/1000000000, <HI>i. e.</HI> by a number
con&s;i&s;ting of ten cyphers; and, as man is to a
&s;permatic worm of the fir&s;t generation in the
&s;ame proportion as this worm is to a worm of
the &s;econd generation, the &s;ize of this la&s;t &s;per|matic
worm will be expre&s;&s;ed by a number con|&s;i&s;ting
of 19 cyphers; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the
&s;ize of a &s;permatic worm of the third generation
mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed by a number con&s;i&s;ting of 28
cyphers, that of the fourth generation by 37
cyphers, that of the fifth generation by 46 cy|phers,
and that of the &s;ixth generation by 55
cyphers. To form an idea of the minutene&s;s
repre&s;ented by this fraction, let us take the di|men&s;ions
of the &s;phere of the univer&s;e from the
Sun to Saturn; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the Sun to be a
<PB N="139" REF="142">
million of times larger than the Earth, and di|&s;tant
from Saturn a thou&s;and &s;olar diameters,
we &s;hall find that 45 cyphers are &s;ufficient to
expre&s;s the number of cubic lines contained in
this &s;phere; and, if we reduce each cubic line
into a thou&s;and million of atoms, no more than
54 cyphers will be nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s their
number: Of cour&s;e, a man will be proportional|ly
greater, when compared with a &s;permatic
worm of the &s;ixth generation, than the &s;phere
of the univer&s;e when compared to the &s;malle&s;t
atom that can be &s;een with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a
micro&s;cope. But, if this calculation were carried
on to the 16th generation, the minutene&s;s would
exceed all powers of expre&s;&s;ion. It is apparent,
therefore, that the probability of this hypothe&s;is
vani&s;hes in proportion as the object dinini&s;hes.
This calculation applies equally to eggs as to
&s;permatic worms; and the want of probability
is common to both. It will, no doubt, be ob|jected,
that, as matter is infinitely divi&s;ible, this
gradual diminution of &s;ize is not impo&s;&s;ible.
To this I reply, that all infinities, whether in
geometry or in arithmetic, are only mental ab|&s;tractions,
and have no actual exi&s;tence in Na|ture.
If the infinite divi&s;ibility of matter is to
be regarded as an ab&s;olute infinite, it is ea&s;y to
demon&s;trate, that, in this &s;en&s;e, it has no ex|i&s;tence;
for, if we once &s;uppo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t po&s;|&s;ible
atom, by the very &s;uppo&s;ition, this atom
mu&s;t be indivi&s;ible; becau&s;e, if it were divi&s;ible,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
it would not be the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible atom, which
is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition. It is, therefore,
apparent, that every hypothe&s;is which admits
an infinite progre&s;&s;ion ought to be rejected not
only as fal&s;e, but as de&s;titute of every ve&s;tige
of probability; and, as both the vermicular and
ovular &s;y&s;tems &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a progre&s;&s;ion, they
&s;hould be excluded for ever from philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;y&s;tems are liable to another objection:
In the ovular &s;y&s;tem, the fir&s;t woman contain|ed
both male and female eggs; the male eggs
could only give origin to males; but the female
eggs behoved to contain millions of generations
of both males and females: Hence every wo|man
mu&s;t have always contained a certain num|ber
of eggs capable of being unfolded <HI>in infini|tum,</HI>
and another number, which could only be
unfolded once, and could have no farther ope|ration
in the &s;eries of exi&s;tence. The &s;ame
thing mu&s;t take place in the vermicular &s;y&s;tem.
Hence we may conclude, that there is not the
&s;malle&s;t degree of probability in hypothe&s;es of
this nature.</P>
<P>A third difficulty &s;till remains, ari&s;ing from
the re&s;emblance of children &s;ometimes to the
father, &s;ometimes to the mother, and &s;ometimes
to both, and from the evident characters of &s;pe|cific
differences in mules and other mon&s;trous
productions. If the foetus proceeds from the
&s;permatic worm of the father, how comes the
child to re&s;emble its mother? If the foetus pre|exi&s;ts
<PB N="141" REF="144">
in the egg of the mother, how &s;hould the
child re&s;emble its father? And, if the &s;permatic
worm of a hor&s;e, or the egg of a &s;he-a&s;s, be the
origin of the foetus, how &s;hould the mule par|take
of the nature and figure both of the hor&s;e
and a&s;s?</P>
<P>The&s;e general objections, though perfectly
invincible, are not the only difficulties with
which the&s;e &s;y&s;tems are embarra&s;&s;ed. May it
not be demanded of tho&s;e who embrace the ver|micular
&s;y&s;tem, how the&s;e worms are tran&s;|formed,
and wherein con&s;i&s;ts the analogy be|tween
this transformation and that which in&s;ects
undergo? The caterpillar which is to become a
butterfly, pa&s;&s;es through a middle &s;tate, and, after
it cea&s;es to be a chry&s;alis, is completely formed,
has acquired its full growth, and is in&s;tantly
capable of generating: But, in the pretended
transformation of the &s;permatic worm of a man,
there is no middle or chry&s;alis &s;tate; and, &s;up|po&s;ing
this to happen during the fir&s;t days of
conception, why is not the production of this
chry&s;alis, in place of an unformed embryo, a
perfect adult? Here all analogy cea&s;es; and, of
cour&s;e, the notion of the transformation of the
&s;permatic worm can receive no &s;upport from this
quarter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the worm which is to be transformed
into a flie proceeds from an egg; this egg is
produced by the copulation of the male and fe|male,
and it includes the foetus which is to pa&s;s
<PB N="142" REF="145">
into a chry&s;alis, before it arrives at the perfect
&s;tate of a flie, and before it acquires the power
of generating. But the &s;permatic worm has no
generative faculty; neither does it proceed from
an egg: And, though it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that
the &s;emen contains eggs which produce the &s;per|matic
animals, the &s;ame difficulty &s;till remains;
for the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed eggs are not a re&s;ult of the
copulation of two &s;exes, like tho&s;e of in&s;ects. Con|&s;equently,
the analogy fails here likewi&s;e; and
the transformation of in&s;ects, in place of &s;trength|ening
this hypothe&s;is, &s;eems entirely to de&s;troy
it.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of vegetables are re&s;orted to, in or|der
to account for the infinite number of &s;per|matic
animals: But this analogy does not ap|ply;
for, all the &s;permatic animals, one only ex|cepted,
mu&s;t ab&s;olutely peri&s;h. The &s;eeds of
vegetables, however, are not &s;ubject to the &s;ame
nece&s;&s;ity. When they become not vegetables
them&s;elves, they nouri&s;h other organized bodies,
and &s;erve the purpo&s;es of growth and of repro|duction
to animals. But the prodigious &s;uper|fluity
of &s;permatic animals can an&s;wer no end
whatever. I make this remark, purely becau&s;e
I wi&s;h to omit nothing that has been advanced
on the &s;ubject; for I acknowledge, that no ar|gument
drawn from final cau&s;es can either
e&s;tabli&s;h or de&s;troy a phy&s;ical theory.</P>
<P>The apparent equality in the number of &s;per|matic
animalcules in all animals, has al&s;o been
<PB N="143" REF="146">
objected to by the &s;upporters of this doctrine.
If the&s;e animalcules are the immediate cau&s;e of
generation, why is there no proportion between
their numbers and tho&s;e of the young, which
are various in men, quadrupeds, birds, fi&s;hes,
and in&s;ects? Be&s;ides, there is no proportional
difference in mo&s;t &s;pecies of &s;permatic animals,
tho&s;e of a rat being nearly equal in &s;ize to tho&s;e
of a man. Even when a difference in &s;ize takes
place, it has no proportion to the bulks of the
animals. The &s;permatic animals of the calmar,
which is a &s;mall fi&s;h, are a hundred thou&s;and
times larger than tho&s;e of a man or of a dog.
This is an additional proof that the&s;e worms
are not the &s;ole and immediate cau&s;e of genera|tion.</P>
<P>The particular objections to the ovular &s;y&s;tem
are not le&s;s weighty. If the foetus exi&s;ted in
the egg before the junction of the male and
female, why do we not &s;ee the foetus in the egg
before impregnation, as clearly as after it? We
formerly mentioned, that Malpighius always
found the foetus in eggs which had received the
impregnation of the male, and could di&s;cover
nothing but an unformed mole or ma&s;s in the
cicatrice of unimpregnated eggs. It is, there|fore,
evident, that the foetus is never formed till
the egg has been impregnated.</P>
<P>Farther, we not only cannot di&s;cover the foe|tus
in eggs before the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes,
but we have not been able to demon&s;trate the
<PB N="144" REF="147">
exi&s;tence of eggs in viviparous animals. Tho&s;e
phy&s;icians who pretend that the &s;permatic worm
is the foetus inclo&s;ed in a coat or covering, are
at lea&s;t a&s;certained of the exi&s;tence of &s;permatic
worms; but tho&s;e who maintain that the foetus
pre-exi&s;ts in the egg, have no evidence of the
exi&s;tence of the egg it&s;elf; for the probability of
their non-exi&s;tence in viviparous animals a|mounts
almo&s;t to a certainty.</P>
<P>Though the partizans of the ovular &s;y&s;tem
agree nto as to what ought to be regarded as the
real egg in the te&s;ticles of females, they all allow,
however, that impregnation is accompli&s;hed in
the te&s;ticles or ovarium. But they never con|&s;ider,
that, if this were the ca&s;e, mo&s;t foetu&s;es
would be found in the abdomen in place of the
uterus; for, as the &s;uperior extremity of the
Fallopian tube is unconnected with the ovarium,
the pretended eggs would often fall into the ab|domen.
Now, we know this to be at lea&s;t a
very rare phaenomenon; and it is probable that
it never happens but by means of &s;ome violent
accident.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections and difficulties have not e|&s;caped
the ingenious author of <HI>Venus Phy&s;ique.</HI>
But, as his work is in the hands of the public,
and as it admits not of abridgement, we &s;hall
refer the reader to the book it&s;elf; and &s;hall
conclude with an account of a few particular
experiments, &s;ome of which appeared to favour
and others to contradict the above &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148">
In the hi&s;tory of the Academy of &s;ciences,
ann. 1701, &s;ome objections are propo&s;ed by M.
Mery again&s;t the egg-&s;y&s;tem. This able anato|mi&s;t
maintained, with propriety, that the ve&s;icles
found in the te&s;ticles of females are not eggs;
that they adhere &s;o firmly to the internal &s;urface
of the te&s;ticle, as not to admit of a natural &s;epa|ration;
and that, though they could &s;eparate
from the &s;ub&s;tance of the te&s;ticle, it was impo&s;|&s;ible
for them to get out of it, becau&s;e the tex|ture
of the common membrane inclo&s;ing the
whole te&s;ticle is &s;o firm and &s;trong, that it is im|practicable
to conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of its being
pierced by a ve&s;icle or round &s;oft egg. And,
as mo&s;t anatomi&s;ts and phy&s;icians were prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
in favour of the egg-&s;y&s;tem, and imagined
that the number of cicatrices in the te&s;ticles cor|re&s;ponded
with the number of foetu&s;es, M. Mery
&s;howed &s;uch a quantity of the&s;e cicatrices in the
te&s;ticles of a woman, as, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of
the truth of this &s;y&s;tem, would have argued a
fecundity beyond the power of credibility.
The&s;e difficulties &s;timulated other anatomi&s;ts of
the academy, who were partizans of the eggs,
to make new re&s;earches. M. Duverney ex|amined
the te&s;ticles of cows and &s;heep, and
maintained, that the ve&s;icles were eggs, becau&s;e
&s;ome of them adhered le&s;s firmly to the te&s;ticles
than others; and that it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e
that they &s;eparated altogether when they arrived
at full maturity; e&s;pecially as by blowing into
<PB N="146" REF="149">
the cavity of the te&s;ticle, the air pa&s;&s;ed between
the ve&s;icles and the adjacent parts. M. Mery
&s;imply replied, that this proof was in&s;ufficient,
as the&s;e ve&s;icles were never &s;een &s;eparate from
the te&s;ticles. M. Duverney farther remarked
the glandular bodies upon the te&s;ticles; but he
never con&s;idered them as parts e&s;&s;ential to ge|neration,
but as accidental excre&s;cences, like
gall-nuts on the oak. M. Littre, who&s;e preju|dices
in favour of eggs were &s;till &s;tronger,
maintained, not only that the ve&s;icles were eggs,
but even a&s;&s;ured us, that he di&s;covered in one of
them a well formed foetus, of which he could
di&s;tingui&s;h both the head and trunk; and he has
even given their dimen&s;ions. But, admitting
this wonder, which never appeared to any eyes
excepting his own, to be convinced of the doubt|fulne&s;s
of the fact, we have only to peru&s;e his
memoir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann&eacute;e 1701, p. 111.</NOTE>. From his own de&s;cription it appears,
that the uterus was &s;chirrous, and the te&s;ticle
very much corrupted; that the ve&s;icle or egg,
which contained the pretended foetus, was much
le&s;s than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">mmon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nuck furni&s;hes us with a celebrated experi|ment
in favour of eggs. He opened a bitch three
days after copulation; he drew out one of the
<HI>horns</HI> of the uterus, and tied it in the middle &s;o
as to prevent the &s;uperior part of the Fallopian
tube from having any communication with the
inferior part. After this he replaced the <HI>horn</HI> of
<PB N="147" REF="150">
the uterus, and clo&s;ed the wound. Twenty-four
days afterwards, he again opened the
wound, and found two foetu&s;es in the &s;uperior
part of the tube, that is, between the te&s;ticles and
the ligature; and there was no foetus in the un|der
part. In the other horn of the uterus, that
was not tied, he found three foetu&s;es regularly
di&s;po&s;ed; which proves, &s;ays he, that the foetus
proceeds not from the male-&s;emen, but that it
exi&s;ts in the egg of the female. Suppo&s;ing this
experiment, which is &s;ingle, had been often re|peated
with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, the conclu&s;ion the
author draws from it is not legitimate: It proves
no more than that the foetus may be formed in
the &s;uperior part of the horn of the uterus, as
well as in the inferior; and it is natural to think
that, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the ligature, the &s;eminal
liquor in the inferior part was forced out, and,
of cour&s;e, fru&s;trated the work of generation in
that region of the uterus.</P>
<P>This is all the length that anatomi&s;ts and phy|&s;icians
have proceeded in the &s;ubject of genera|tion.
It only remains that I deliver the re&s;ults
of my own experiments and inquiries; and I
&s;hall leave the reader to judge whether my &s;y|&s;tem
be not infinitely more con&s;onant to nature
than any of tho&s;e of which I have given an ac|count.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Experiments on Generation.</HEAD>
<P>I Often reflected on the above two &s;y&s;tems of
generation, and was daily more and more
convinced that my theory was infinitely more
probable. At length I began to &s;u&s;pect that the&s;e
living organic particles, from which I thought all
animals and vegetables derived their origin,
might be recognized, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of good
gla&s;&s;es. My fir&s;t notion was, that the &s;permatic
animalcules found in the &s;eminal fluid of all
males, might probably be the&s;e very organic
particles; and I rea&s;oned in this manner. If all
animals and vegetables contain an infinite num|ber
of organic particles, the&s;e particles &s;hould be
mo&s;t abundant in their &s;eeds, becau&s;e the &s;eed is
an extract from all the organic parts, and e&s;pe|cially
from tho&s;e which are mo&s;t analogous to the
individual: Perhaps the &s;permatic animals found
in the &s;emen of males may actually be tho&s;e very
organic particles, or at lea&s;t, the fir&s;t union or
a&s;&s;emblages of them. But, if this be the ca&s;e,
then the &s;emen of females ought to contain or|ganic
living particles, or animalcules, &s;imilar to
<PB N="149" REF="152">
tho&s;e of the male. They ought, for the &s;ame
rea&s;on, to be found in the &s;eeds of plants, in the
nectarium, and in the &s;tamina, which are the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential parts of vegetables, and contain the or|ganic
particles nece&s;&s;ary for their reproduction.
I therefore determined to examine with the
micro&s;cope the &s;eminal liquors of males and fe|males,
and the germs of plants; and, at the &s;ame
time, I imagined that the cavities of the glandu|lar
bodies of the uterus might be the re&s;ervoirs
of the female &s;emen. Having communicated
my ideas of this &s;ubject to my ingenious friends
Mr Needham, M. Daubenton, M. Gueneau, and
M. Dalibard, they encouraged me to commence
a &s;et of experiments in order to throw light up|on
this my&s;terious operation of nature. All of
the&s;e gentlemen occa&s;ionally attended and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
me; but particularly M. Daubenton, who was
never ab&s;ent, and who was witne&s;s to every ex|periment
I made.</P>
<P>I employed a double micro&s;cope, which I had
from Mr Needham, being the &s;ame with which
he made his numerous and ingenious ob&s;erva|tions

<P>Having procured the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els of a man
who died a violent death, and who&s;e body was
&s;till warm, I extracted all the liquor from them,
and put it in a vial. I examined, by the micro|&s;cope,
a drop of this liquor, without any dilution.
As &s;oon as the vapours, which aro&s;e from the

and, in others, intermingled with each other.
The&s;e filaments clearly appeared to be agitated
with an internal undulatory motion, like hollow
tubes, which contained &s;ome moving &s;ub&s;tance.
I &s;aw di&s;tinctly [pl. I. fig. 2.] two of the&s;e fi|laments,
which were joined longitudinally, &s;e|parate
from each other in the middle, and alter|nately
approach and recede, like two &s;tretched
cords, fixed by the ends, and drawn a&s;under at
the middle. The&s;e filaments were compo&s;ed of
globules which touched one another, and re&s;em|bled
a chaplet of beads. I then ob&s;erved fila|ments
[pl. I. fig. 3.] which were blown up, and
&s;welled in certain places, and perceived &s;mall
oval globules i&s;&s;ue from the&s;e &s;welled parts,
which had a vibratory motion, like that of a
pendulum [pl. I. fig. 4.] The&s;e &s;mall bodies
were attached to the filament by little threads,
<PB N="151" REF="154">
which gradually lengthened as the bodies mo|ved:
And, la&s;tly, I ob&s;erved the&s;e &s;mall bo|dies
detach them&s;elves entirely from the large
filament, and draw after them the little thread,
which re&s;embled a tail. As the liquor was too
thick, and the filaments too near each other, I
diluted another drop with pure rain water, after
&s;atisfying my&s;elf that it contained no animal|cules.
I then perceived that the filaments were
more di&s;tant from each other, and &s;aw di&s;tinctly
the motion of the &s;mall bodies above taken no|tice
of, [pl. I. fig. 5.] which was more free,
and they appeared to &s;wim with greater agility,
and trailed their threads after them with greater
ea&s;e; and, if I had not &s;een them &s;eparate from
the filaments, and draw the threads out of them,
I &s;hould have believed, from this &s;econd ob&s;er|vation,
the moving bodies to be real animals, and
their threads to be tails. After examining with
great attention one of the filaments, which was
three times thicker than the &s;mall bodies, I per|ceived
two of tho&s;e bodies detach them&s;elves
with much difficulty, and drag after them long
&s;lender threads, which impeded their motion.</P>
<P>This &s;eminal liquor was at fir&s;t too thick.
But it gradually became more fluid, and, in le&s;s

changed, in the manner to be ju&s;t men|tioned.</P>

thread, from which they evidently endeavoured
to di&s;engage them&s;elves; their progre&s;&s;ive mo|tion

vibrated to the right and left. At each vibration,
they had a rolling un&s;teady motion; &s;o that,

it &s;ometimes prevents the progre&s;&s;ive motion al|together,

the filaments of which were of a con&s;ide|rable

proceed from the thicke&s;t part of the liquor,

at la&s;t they divided into globules, which &s;eemed

as they receded from the filaments, and they ap|peared
to make con&s;iderable efforts to di&s;engage

drew tails of different lengths out of the

to proceed in troops from one &s;ide of the

field of the micro&s;cope in le&s;s than four &s;econds;
they marched in lines of &s;even or eight in front;
and &s;ucceeded each other without interruption,
like the defiling of &s;oldiers. I ob&s;erved this &s;in|gular

and, as the current of animals did not then cea&s;e,
I was de&s;irous of di&s;covering the cau&s;e. I there|fore
gently &s;hifted the gla&s;s, and perceived that
all the&s;e moving globules proceeded from a kind
of mucilage, [pl. II. fig. 11.] or net-work of fi|laments,
which continually produced them, and
with more rapidity and copiou&s;ne&s;s than the fila|ments
had done ten hours before. There was
&s;till a difference more remarkable between the
globules produced by the liquor when thick, and
tho&s;e produced when it was more fluid; for, in
the latter ca&s;e, they drew no threads or tails af|ter
them, their motion was quicker, and they
went in flocks like &s;heep. I examined the mu|cilage
from which they proceeded for a long
time, and perceived that it gradually dimini&s;hed
and was converted into moving globules, till
more than one half of it was de&s;troyed. After
which, the liquor being too dry, this mucilage
became ob&s;cure in the middle, and it was &s;ur|rounded
with &s;mall threads, forming &s;quare inter|vals,

&s;earched this liquor for the &s;ilaments which appear|ed
in that of men. I only remarked &s;ome long
and very delicate threads, exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e
which &s;erved for tails to the globules. The&s;e
threads contained no globules; neither had they
any motion. The globules with tails &s;eemed to
move with more vivacity than tho&s;e in the hu|man

vibrations; but they always rolled vertically.
Their number was not great; and, though their

their tails: On the third, very few of them re|tained
their tails; on the fourth, however, &s;ome

the&s;e la&s;t appeared to be le&s;s, and more active [Pl.

<P>A live bitch was next di&s;&s;ected, which had
been four or five days in &s;ea&s;on, without having
any communication with the male. The te&s;ticles
were as large as &s;ilberds. On one of them I found
a red prominent glandular body of the &s;ize of a

one of which was more prominent than the o|ther.
Having opened this fi&s;&s;ure, a liquor di|&s;tilled
from it, which we collected for exa|mination.
The te&s;ticles were then returned
into the body of the animal, which was &s;till

glance, moving bodies with tails, exactly &s;imilar

<P>Some time after, another bitch was opened,
which had been &s;even or eight days in &s;ea&s;on,

in full perfection. The fir&s;t was half open,

and was full of &s;eminal fluid; the &s;econd was
larger and more prominent, and the fi&s;&s;ure or
canal that contained the fluid was below the nip|ple,
which protruded outward. I took the li|quor
out of both the glandular bodies, and, on
compari&s;on, found them entirely &s;imilar. This
&s;eminal liquor of the female is equally fluid with
that of the male. After examining the liquors
extracted from each te&s;ticle, I found in them the
very &s;ame moving bodies [pl. IV. fig. 21.]. I
perceived at lei&s;ure the &s;ame phaenomena that I
had ob&s;erved in the &s;eminal liquor of the other

them. Their number was equally great with
that in the male &s;emen.</P>

<HEAD>EXPER. XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;queezed the whole liquor out of the&s;e two

watch. The quantity was &s;ufficient to &s;erve for
four or five hours ob&s;ervation. I remarked that
it depo&s;ited a kind of &s;ediment, or at lea&s;t began
to thicken. I took a drop of the thicke&s;t part
of the liquor, and having examined it, I di&s;co|vered
that the mucilaginous part of the &s;emen
was conden&s;ed, and formed a kind of net-work.
From the anterior edge of this net-work, there
i&s;&s;ued a current of globules which moved with
great rapidity [Pl. IV. fig. 22.]. The&s;e globules
were extremely active and lively, and they ap|peared
to be dive&s;ted of their mucilaginous co|verings,
and of their tails. This &s;tream of glo|bules
re&s;embled the motion of the blood in the
veins; for they &s;eemed not only to be animated,
but to be pu&s;hed on by &s;ome common force,
which obliged them to follow each other in
troops or rows. From this experiment, and from
the 11th and 12th, I concluded, that, when the
fluid begins to coagulate or grow thick, the ac|tive

globules break their mucilaginous covering,
and e&s;cape at that &s;ide where the liquor is mo&s;t

their glandular bodies, are very minute, I could
make no exact experiments on their &s;eminal li|quor.
I only di&s;covered, that the te&s;ticles of

that I never &s;aw any of them which exactly

<P>On the te&s;ticles of &s;ome cows, I found a

<HI>hydatides</HI> by anatomi&s;ts. I ob&s;erved &s;ome of
them large and others &s;mall; and they were at|tached
to the te&s;ticle by a kind of pedicle. I
examined the liquor they contained; but it was

<P>At this time, I made &s;ome experiments upon
oi&s;ter-water, upon water in which pepper had

been boiled, upon water in which pepper had
been &s;imply infu&s;ed, and upon water in which
pink-&s;eeds were infu&s;ed. The bottles contain|ing
all the&s;e infu&s;ions were exactly corked. At
the end of two days, I &s;aw, in the oi&s;ter-water,
a va&s;t quantity of oval and globular bodies,
which &s;eemed to &s;wim like fi&s;hes in a pond, and
had every appearance of being real animals.
They had no members that could be di&s;covered,
and no tails. They were tran&s;parent, and pretty
large; I &s;aw them change their figures; they
became gradually &s;maller and &s;maller during
the &s;even or eight days that they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and,
la&s;tly, along with Mr Needham, I &s;aw animal|cules
&s;o very &s;imilar, in an infu&s;ion of the jelly
of roa&s;ted veal, which had likewi&s;e been clo&s;e
corked, that I am per&s;uaded they are not true
animals, agreeable to the common acceptation
of that term, as &s;hall afterwards be fully ex|plained.</P>
<P>The infu&s;ion of pink-&s;eeds was crowded with
innumerable moving globules, which appeared
to be equally animated with tho&s;e in the &s;eminal
liquors and in infu&s;ions of the fle&s;h of animals.
At fir&s;t they were pretty large, and moved with
great rapidity in every po&s;&s;ible direction. They
continued in this &s;tate during three weeks, and
gradually dimini&s;hed in &s;ize till their minutene&s;s
rendered them invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;ame phaenomenon took place in the in|fu&s;ions
of pepper; but the moving bodies did
<PB N="185" REF="192">
not appear &s;o early as in the other infu&s;ions, and
their appearance was later in the infu&s;ion of pep|per
that was not boiled. I then began to &s;u&s;pect
that what is called fermentation, might be ow|ing
to the motion of the&s;e organic particles in
animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. To di&s;cover
if there was any &s;imilarity between this &s;pecies
of fermentation, and that excited by mineral &s;ub|&s;tances,
I applied to the micro&s;cope a little lime|&s;tone
powder, and poured upon it a drop of
aquafortis. But the phaenomena were totally
different. Large bubbles ro&s;e to the &s;urface, and
in&s;tantly darkened the lens of the micro&s;cope;
when the gro&s;s parts were di&s;&s;olved, every thing
remained at re&s;t, and nothing appeared which
had the &s;malle&s;t analogy to what we perceive in

<HEAD>EXPER. XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>Before I conclude this chapter, I &s;hall relate
the experiments of Mr Needham upon the &s;e|men
of a &s;pecies of cuttle-fi&s;h, called the <HI>Calmar.</HI>
This acute ob&s;erver, having examined the &s;per|matic
animals in the milts of different fi&s;hes,
found them of an uncommon magnitude in the
milt of the calmar. To the naked eye, they
were from three to four lines in length. During
a whole &s;ummer, while he di&s;&s;ected calmars at
Li&s;bon, he could find no appearance of a milt,
or of any re&s;ervoir de&s;tined to receive the &s;emi|nal
liquor of that fi&s;h; and it was the middle of
December before he could perceive the fir&s;t ve|&s;tiges
of a new ve&s;&s;el filled with a milty juice.
This re&s;ervoir, and the juice it contained, gra|dually
increa&s;ed. In examining this &s;eminal li|quor
with the micro&s;cope, he &s;aw nothing in it
but &s;mall opaque globules &s;wimming in a kind
of &s;erous matter, without any appearance of life.
But, &s;ome time after, he di&s;covered, in the milt
of another calmar, organic bodies compleatly
formed, which re&s;embled &s;piral &s;prings, [<HI>a, b,</HI>
Pl. I. fig. 5.] inclo&s;ed in a tran&s;parent ca&s;e.
The&s;e &s;prings were equally perfect at the fir&s;t
ob&s;ervation as afterwards; only they, in time,
contracted them&s;elves, and formed a kind of
&s;crew. The head of the ca&s;e is a &s;pecies of valve
<PB N="187" REF="194">
which opens outward, and through which every
thing within may be forced out. It contains,
be&s;ides, another valve <HI>b,</HI> a little barrel, <HI>c,</HI> and a
&s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance <HI>d, e.</HI> Thus the whole machine
con&s;i&s;ts of an outer, tran&s;parent, cartilaginous
ca&s;e, <HI>a, fig.</HI> 2. the &s;uperior extremity of which
is terminated by a round head, formed by the
ca&s;e it&s;elf, and performs the office of a valve.
This external ca&s;e contains a tran&s;parent tube,
which includes the &s;pring, a pi&s;ton or valve, a
little barrel, and a &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance. The &s;krew
occupies the &s;uperior part of the tube and ca&s;e,
the pi&s;ton and barrel are &s;ituated in the middle,
and the &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance occupies the inferior
part. The&s;e machines pump the liquor of the
milt; the &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance is full of this liquor;
and, before the animal &s;pawns, the whole milt
is only a congeries of the&s;e organic bodies, which
have ab&s;olutely pumped up and dried the mil|ty
liquor. Whenever the&s;e &s;mall machines are
taken from the body of the animal, and put a|mong
water, or expo&s;ed to the air, they begin to
act [Pl. V. fig. 2. and 3.]; the &s;pring mounts
up, and is followed by the pi&s;ton, the barrel, and
the &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance which contains the liquor:
And, as &s;oon as the &s;pring and the tube in which
it is contained begin to i&s;&s;ue out of the ca&s;e, the
&s;pring plaits, and the whole internal apparatus
moves, till the &s;pring, the pi&s;ton, and the barrel
have entirely e&s;caped from the ca&s;e. When
this is effected, all the re&s;t in&s;tantly follow, and
<PB N="188" REF="195">
the milty liquor, which had been pumped, and
was confined in the &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance, runs out
through the barrel.</P>
<P>As this phaenomenon is extremely &s;ingular,
and inconte&s;tibly proves that the moving bodies
in the milt of the calmar are not real animals,
but &s;imple machines, a &s;pecies of pumps, I &s;hall
here tran&s;cribe Mr Needham's own account of
the matter:</P>
<P>'When the &s;mall machines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Needham's New Di&s;coveries made with the Micro&s;cope, ch. 6. p. 53.</NOTE>,' &s;ays he, 'have
come to their full maturity, &s;everal of them act
as &s;oon as they are expo&s;ed to the air. Mo&s;t
of them, however, may be commodiou&s;ly
viewed by the micro&s;cope before their action
commences; and, even before they act, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to moi&s;ten with a drop of water the
&s;uperior extremity of the external ca&s;e, which
then begins to expand, while the two &s;lender
ligaments that i&s;&s;ue out of the ca&s;e are twi&s;ted
and contorted in different ways. At the &s;ame
time, the &s;crew ri&s;es &s;lowly, and the &s;pirals at
its &s;uperior end approach each other, and act
again&s;t the top of the ca&s;e, tho&s;e which are
lower &s;eeming to be continually followed by
others that i&s;&s;ue from the pi&s;ton; I &s;ay, that
they <HI>&s;eem</HI> to follow; becau&s;e I believe it to be
only a deception produced by the motion of
the &s;crew. The pi&s;ton and barrel likewi&s;e
move in the &s;ame direction; and the inferior
<PB N="189" REF="196">
part, which contains the &s;emen, extends in
length, and, at the &s;ame time, moves towards
the top of the ca&s;e, which is apparent by the
vacuity left at the bottom. As &s;oon as the
&s;crew, with the tube in which it is inclo&s;ed,
begins to appear out of the ca&s;e, it twi&s;ts, be|cau&s;e
it is con&s;trained by the two ligaments.
The whole internal apparatus continues to
move gradually and &s;lowly till the &s;crew, the
pi&s;ton, and the barrel, have entirely e&s;caped.
When that happens, the remainder i&s;&s;ues in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly.
The pi&s;ton, <HI>b</HI> [Pl. V. fig. 2.].
&s;eparates from the barrel <HI>a</HI>; the ligament,
which is under the barrel, &s;wells and acquires
a diameter equal to that of the &s;pongy part
which &s;ucceeds it: This, though much broader
than when in the ca&s;e, becomes al&s;o five times
longer than formerly. The tube, which in|cluded
the whole, contracts in the middle, and
forms two knots or joints, <HI>d, e,</HI> [Pl. V. fig. 2.
and 3.], di&s;tant about one third of its length
from each extremity. Then the &s;emen e&s;capes
by the barrel <HI>e,</HI> [fig. 2.]. It is compo&s;ed of
&s;mall opaque globules, which &s;wim in a &s;erous
matter, without di&s;covering any &s;igns of life,
and are preci&s;ely the &s;ame as I perceived them
to be when diffu&s;ed through the re&s;ervoir of
the milt. In the figure, the part comprehend|ed
between the two joints <HI>d, e,</HI> appear to be
fringed. When examined attentively, this
appearance &s;eems to be occa&s;ioned by the &s;pon|gy
<PB N="190" REF="197">
&s;ub&s;tance within the tube being broken and
divided into portions nearly equal. The fol|lowing
phaenomena will clearly prove that
this is the ca&s;e.'</P>
<P>'It &s;ometimes happens, that the &s;crew and
the tube break preci&s;ely above the pi&s;ton <HI>b,</HI>
which remains in the barrel <HI>e,</HI> [fig. 3.]. Then
the tube in&s;tantly &s;huts; and, by contracting,
a&s;&s;umes a conical figure above the extremity of
the &s;crew, <HI>f.</HI> This is a demon&s;tration that it
is there very ela&s;tic; and the manner in which
it accommodates its figure to that of the &s;ub|&s;tance
which includes it, when the latter un|dergoes
the &s;malle&s;t change, proves that it is
every where equally ela&s;tic.'</P>
<P>M. Needham hence concludes, that it is na|tural
to imagine that the total action of this
machine is occa&s;ioned by the &s;pring of the &s;crew.
But, unfortunately, he proves, by &s;everal expe|riments,
that the &s;crew is acted upon by a power
re&s;iding in the &s;pongy part: As &s;oon as the
&s;crew is &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the machine,
it cea&s;es to act, and lo&s;es all motion. The au|thor
draws the following conclu&s;ion from this
&s;ingular phaenomenon.</P>
<P>'If I had &s;een,' &s;ays he, 'the&s;e pretended ani|malcules
in the &s;emen of living animals, I &s;hould,
perhaps, have been able to a&s;certain whether
they are really animated beings, or only pro|digiou&s;ly
&s;mall machines, which corre&s;pond in
miniature to the larger ve&s;&s;els of the calmar.'</P>
<P><PB REF="198" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate VII.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="199">
From this and other analogies, Mr Needham
concludes, that the &s;permatic worms of other
animals, it is rea&s;onable to think, are only or|ganic
bodies; a &s;pecies of machines &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of the calmar, which act at different times;
for, &s;ays he, if we &s;uppo&s;e that, of the prodi|gious
number of &s;permatic animalcules which
appear in the field of the micro&s;cope, only a few
thou&s;ands act at a time, this will be &s;ufficient to
make us believe the whole to be alive. If it be
farther &s;uppo&s;ed, he adds, that the motion of
each animalcule la&s;ts, like that of the calmar
machines, about half a minute; in this ca&s;e, the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive action of the &s;mall machines would
continue for a con&s;iderable time, and the ani|malcules
would die one after another. Be&s;ides,
why &s;hould the &s;emen of the calmar alone con|tain
machines, while that of all other animals
contain real living animalcules? Here the ana|logy
is &s;o &s;trong as to be almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. Mr
Needham farther remarks, that even Leeuwen|hoek's
experiments &s;eem to indicate that the
&s;permatic animals have a great re&s;emblance to the
organic bodies in the &s;emen of the calmar.
Speaking of the &s;emen of the cod, Leeuwen|hoek
remarks, that he imagined the oval bodies
to be animalcules bur&s;t and di&s;tended, becau&s;e
they were four times larger than when alive.
And, in another place, he ob&s;erves of the &s;emen
of the dog, that the animalcules often changed
<PB N="192" REF="200">
their figure, e&s;pecially when the liquor began to
evaporate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Leeuwenh. Arc. nat. p. 306. 309. and 319.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On all the&s;e accounts, Mr Needham conjec|tured,
that the pretended &s;permatic animals were
only a kind of natural machines, bodies much
more &s;imply organized than tho&s;e of real ani|mals.
I examined the machines of the calmar
along with him, and the reader may be a&s;&s;ured
that his de&s;cription of them is both exact and
faithful. His experiments, therefore, demon|&s;trate,
that the &s;eminal fluid con&s;i&s;ts of particles
in que&s;t of organization; that, in fact, it pro|duces
organized bodies; but that the&s;e bodies are
not animals, nor &s;imilar to the individual which
produces them. It is, indeed, probable, that
the&s;e organized bodies are only a kind of in&s;tru|ments
for perfecting the &s;emen, and be&s;towing
on it an active force; and that it is by their in|ternal
action that they intimately penetrate the
&s;eminal fluid of the female.</P>

<P>THOUGH my experiments were made
with all the attention of which I was ca|pable,

&s;atisfied that many things mu&s;t have e&s;caped me.
I have only de&s;cribed what I &s;aw, and what e|very

really appeared; and it was not till I had di|ge&s;ted

<P>I have tran&s;cribed the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from the Phi|lo&s;ophical
Tran&s;actions, becau&s;e they fir&s;t ap|peared
in that work, before Leeuwenhoek had
formed any theory; and, therefore, they mu&s;t
be more agreeable to truth. After the ingenious
author had formed a &s;y&s;tem of generation, his
account of the &s;permatic animals varies, even in
matters that are e&s;&s;ential<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the author attempts a formal proof that Leeuwen|hoek invented the &s;ingle micro&s;cope, and the exi&s;tence of &s;per|matic animals, before Hart&s;oeker, which interrupts the argu|ment, is noways intere&s;ting to the reader, and is here omitted in the tran&s;lation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, what he &s;ays concerning the
number of the&s;e pretended animalcules is true;
but the figure of their bodies corre&s;ponds not
always to his de&s;cription. Sometimes the end
next the tail is globular and &s;ometimes cylindri|cal;
<PB N="200" REF="208">
&s;ometimes it is flat, and at other times it is
broader than long, &amp;c. With regard to the
tail, it is often thicker and &s;horter than
he makes it. The vibratory motion, he a|&s;cribes
to the tail, and by which he alledges
the animals are enabled to proceed forward, I
never could di&s;tingui&s;h in the manner he de|&s;cribes
it. I have &s;een the&s;e moving bodies vi|brate
eight or ten times, from right to left, or from
left to right, without advancing the breadth of a
&s;ingle hair; and I have ob&s;erved many of them
which never could proceed forward, becau&s;e this
tail, in place of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to &s;wim, was, on
the contrary, a &s;mall thread attached to the fila|ments
or mucilaginous part of the liquor, and,
of cour&s;e, totally prevented the progre&s;&s;ive mo|tion
of the body. Even when the tail appeared
to have any motion, it only re&s;embled the &s;mall
bendings of a thread at the end of a vibration.
I have &s;een the&s;e threads or tails fixed to the
filaments, which Leeuwenhoek calls ve&s;&s;els:
I have &s;een them &s;eparate from the fila|ments,
after repeated efforts made by the moving
bodies; I have &s;een them fir&s;t long, then dimi|ni&s;h,
and at la&s;t di&s;appear. Thus the&s;e tails
ought to be regarded as accidental appendages,
and not as real members of the moving bodies.
But, what is more remarkable, Leeuwenhoek
expre&s;sly affirms, in this letter to Lord Brouncker,
that, be&s;ides the tailed animals, he ob&s;erved in
this liquor animalcules &s;till more minute that
had no tails, and were perfectly globular: 'His
<PB REF="209" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate VIII.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="201" REF="210">
animalculis (caudatis &s;cilicet) minora adhuc
animalcula, quibus non ni&s;i globuli &s;iguram
attribuere po&s;&s;um, permi&s;ta erant.' This is the
truth. After Leeuwenhoek, however, had main|tained
that the&s;e animalcules were the only effi|cient
principle of generation, and that they were
transformed into men, he regards as real animals
only tho&s;e which had tails; and, accordingly, as
it was nece&s;&s;ary that animalcules, to be tran&s;|formed
into men, &s;hould have a con&s;tant and in|variable
figure, he never afterwards mentions
the round animals without tails. I was &s;truck
with the difference between the original compo|&s;ition
of this letter, and the form in which it ap|peared
twenty years afterwards in his third vo|lume:
For, in&s;tead of the words which we have
ju&s;t now quoted, we meet with the following in
pag. 63. 'Animalculis hi&s;ce permi&s;tae jacebant
aliae minutiores particulae, quibus non aliam
quam globulorum &s;eu &s;phaericam figuram a&s;|&s;ignare
queo.' This is a very different account
of the matter. A particle of matter, to which he
a&s;cribes no motion, is extremely different from
an animalcule. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that Leeuwen|hoek,
in copying his own letter, &s;hould have
changed an article of &s;o much con&s;equence.
What he immediately &s;ubjoins likewi&s;e merits
attention. He &s;ays, that, at the intreaty of Mr
Oldenburg, he had examined this liquor three
or four years ago; and that he then imagined
the&s;e animalcules to be globules. Thus, the&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="211">
pretended animalcules are &s;ometimes globules
without any &s;en&s;ible motion; &s;ometimes they are
globules which move with great activity; &s;ome|times
they have tails, and &s;ometimes no tails.
Speaking of &s;permatic animals in general, he re|marks
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>, 'Ex hi&s;ce meis ob&s;ervationibus cogitare
coepi, quamvis antehac, de animalculis in &s;emi|nibus

animalcula aeque caudis fuerint in&s;tructa, ac
nunc comperi de animalculis in gallorum gal|linaccorum
&s;emine ma&s;culino:' Another proof
that he has often &s;een &s;permatic animals of all
kinds, without tails.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is worthy of remark, that Leeu|wenhoek
had very early di&s;covered the filaments
which appear in the &s;emen before it be liqui|&s;ied;
and that, at that time, when he had not
framed his hypothe&s;is concerning the &s;permatic
animals, he conceived the filaments to be veins,
nerves, and arteries. He firmly believed, that
all the parts and ve&s;&s;els of the human body
might be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the &s;eminal
fluid. He even per&s;i&s;ted in this opinion, not|with&s;tanding
the repre&s;entations made to him by
Mr Oldenburg, in name of the Royal Society.
But, after he conceived the notion of transform|ing
his spermatic animals into men, he never
again takes any notice of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. In&s;tead
of regarding them as the nerves and blood-ve&s;|&s;els
<PB N="203" REF="212">
of the human body already formed in the
&s;emen, he does not even a&s;cribe to them their
real function, which is the production of the
moving bodies. He ob&s;erves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 7.</NOTE>, 'Quid fiet de
omnibus illis particulis &s;eu corpu&s;culis praeter
illa animalcula &s;emini virili hominum inhae|rentibus!
Olim et priu&s;quam haec &s;criberem,
in ea &s;ententia fui praedictas &s;trias vel va&s;a ex
te&s;ticulis principlum &s;ecum ducere,' &amp;c. And,
in another place, he &s;ays, that what he had for|merly
remarked concerning ve&s;&s;els in the &s;emen
de&s;erved no attention.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If we compare the figures 1. 2. 3. and 4.
Pl. VI. and VII. which we have repre&s;ented exactly
as they appear in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,
with tho&s;e which Leeuwenhoek cau&s;ed to be
engraved &s;everal years after, we &s;hall find very
great differences, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the dead
animalcules of the rabbit, 1. 3. and 4. and in
tho&s;e of the dog, which I have al&s;o delineated,
in order to give a di&s;tinct idea of the matter.
From all this, it may fairly be concluded, that
Leeuwenhoek has not always &s;een the &s;ame
phaenomena; that the moving bodies, which he
regards as animals, have appeared to him under
different forms; and that he has contradicted
him&s;elf with a view to make the &s;pecies of men
and of animals uniform and con&s;i&s;tent. He not
only varies as to the fundamental part of the&s;e
experiments, but al&s;o as to the manner of ma|king
<PB N="204" REF="213">
them; for he expre&s;sly tells us, that he al|ways
diluted the &s;emen with water, to &s;eparate
its parts, and to give more freedom of motion to
the animalcules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 92. 93.</NOTE>; and yet, in his fir&s;t letter to
Lord Brouncker, he &s;ays, that, when he mixed
the &s;emen of dogs, in which he before had &s;een
innumerable animals, with water, they all in|&s;tantly
died. Thus Leeuwenhoek's fir&s;t experi|ments
were made, like mine, without any mix|ture;
and, it appears, that he was not in u&s;e to
mix the liquor with water till long after he be|gan
his experiments, and till he conceived the
idea of water's killing the animalcules; which,
however, is not true: I imagine that the addi|tion
of water only di&s;&s;olves the filaments too
&s;uddenly; for, in all my experiments, I have
&s;een but very few filaments in the liquor, after
its being mixed with water.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek was no &s;ooner per&s;uaded that
the &s;permatic animalcules were transformed in|to
men and other animals, than he imagined that
he &s;aw two di&s;tinct kinds in the &s;emen of every
animal, the one male, and the other female.
Without this difference of &s;ex in the &s;permatic
animalcules, it was difficult, he &s;ays, to conceive
the po&s;&s;ibility of producing males and females by
&s;imple transformation. He mentions the&s;e male
and female animalcules in his letter publi&s;hed in
the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, No. 145. and in
&s;everal other places<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See tom. 1. p. 163. and tom. 3. p. 101. of his works.</NOTE>. But he attempts not to
<PB N="205" REF="214">
de&s;cribe the differences between male and fe|male
animalcules, which never exi&s;ted but in
his own imagination.</P>
<P>The famous Boerhaave having a&s;ked Leeu|wenhoek,
whether he had ob&s;erved any diffe|rences
in the growth and &s;ize of &s;permatic ani|mals?
Leeuwenhoek replied, that, in the &s;emen
of a rabbit which he had opened, he &s;aw an in|finite
number of animalcules: 'Incredibilem,'
&s;ays he, 'viventium animalculorum numerum
con&s;pexerunt, cum haec animalcula &s;cypho
impo&s;ita vitreo et illic emortua, in rariores or|dines
di&s;para&s;&s;ent, et per continuos aliquot dies
&s;aepius vi&s;u examina&s;&s;em, quaedam ad ju&s;tam
magnitudinem nondum excrevi&s;&s;e adverti. Ad
haec qua&s;dam ob&s;ervavi particulas perexiles et
oblongas, alias aliis majores, et, quantum ocu|lis

Here we have animalcules of different &s;izes, and
&s;ome with tails, and others that had no tails,
which better corre&s;ponds with my experiments
than with Leeuwenhoek's &s;y&s;tem. We only
differ in a &s;ingle article. He con&s;iders the oblong
bodies without tails as young animalcules which
have not yet arrived at their full growth: But I,
on the contrary, have &s;een the&s;e pretended ani|mals
originally &s;pring from the filaments with
their tails or threads, which they gradually lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215">
In the &s;ame letter to Boerhaave he &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 4. p. 28.</NOTE>, that,
in the &s;emen of a ram he ob&s;erved the animal|cules
marching in flocks like &s;heep: 'A tribus
circiter annis te&s;tes arietis, adhuc calentes, ad
aedes meas deferri curaveram; cum igitur ma|teriam
ex epididymibus eductam, ope micro|&s;copii
contemplarer, non &s;ine ingenti voluptate
advertebam animalcula omnia, quotquot inna|tabant
&s;emini ma&s;culino, eundem natando cur|&s;um
tenere, ita nimirum ut quo itinere priora
praenatarent, eodem po&s;teriora &s;ub&s;equerentur,
adeo ut hi&s;ce animalculis qua&s;i &s;it ingenitum,
quod oves factitare videmus, &s;cilicet ut praece|dentium
ve&s;tigiis grex univer&s;us incedat.' This
ob&s;ervation, made by Leeuwenhoek in the 1713,
and which he regarded as new and &s;ingular, is a
&s;ufficient proof that he had never &s;o attentively
examined the &s;eminal fluids of animals as to en|able
him to give exact de&s;criptions of them. In
the 1713, he was 71 years of age: He had been
in the con&s;tant practice of making experiments
with the micro&s;cope for 45 years: He continu|ed
to publi&s;h his ob&s;ervations during 36 years:
And yet, after all this practice, he now, for the
fir&s;t time, ob&s;erved a phaenomenon which is ex|hibited
in every &s;emen, and which I have de|&s;cribed,
Exper. IX. in the human &s;emen, Ex|per.
XII. in the &s;emen of a dog, and Exper.
XXIX in the &s;emen of a bitch. To explain the
moving of the animalcules of the ram in flocks,
<PB REF="216" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate IX.</HEAD>

<PB N="207" REF="217">
therefore, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e them en|dowed
with the natural in&s;tinct peculiar to &s;heep;
&s;ince tho&s;e of man, of the dog, and of the bitch,
move in the very &s;ame manner; and &s;ince this
motion depends upon particular circum&s;tances,
the principal of which is, that the fluid part of
the &s;emen &s;hould be on one &s;ide, and the thick
or filamentous part on the other; for then the
whole moving bodies di&s;engage them&s;elves from
the filaments, and proceed, in the &s;ame direction,
into the more fluid part of the liquor.</P>
<P>In another letter, written the &s;ame year, and
addre&s;&s;ed to Boerhaave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 4. p. 304.</NOTE>, he relates &s;ome farther
ob&s;ervations concerning the &s;emen of the ram:
He tells us, that, when the liquor was put into
&s;eparate gla&s;&s;es and examined, he ob&s;erved flocks
of animalcules moving all in the &s;ame direction,
and other flocks returning the contrary way.
He adds: 'Neque illud in unica epididymum
parte, &s;ed et in aliis quas praecideram partibus,
ob&s;ervavi. Ad haec, in quadam para&s;tatarum
re&s;ecta portione complura vidi animalcula, quae
necdum in ju&s;tam magnitudinem adoleverant;
nam et corpu&s;cula illis exiliora et caudae triplo
breviores erant quam adultis. Ad haec, caudas
non habebant de&s;inentes in mucronem, quales
tamen adultis e&s;&s;e pa&s;&s;im comperio. Practerea,
in quandam para&s;tatarum portionem incidi, a|nimalculis,
quantum di&s;cernere potui, de&s;titu|tam,

&s;ed altera &s;ui extremitate cra&s;&s;iunculae; i&s;tas
particulas in animalcula tran&s;ituras e&s;&s;e non du|bitabam.'
From this pa&s;&s;age, it is apparent that
Leeuwenhoek had &s;een in this &s;eminal liquor,
what I have found in the &s;emen of all the ani|mals
which I examined, moving bodies that differ|ed
in &s;ize, figure, and motion; and the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
it is obvious, corre&s;pond better with
the notion of organic particles in motion, than
with that of real animals.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that Leeuwenhoek's ob|&s;ervations,
though he draws very different con|clu&s;ions
from them, perfectly corre&s;pond with
mine: And, though there be &s;ome oppo&s;ition in
the facts, I am fully per&s;uaded, that, whoever
&s;hall take the trouble of repeating the experiments,
will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the &s;ource of the&s;e diffe|rences,
and find that I have related nothing but
truth. To enable the reader to decide in this
matter, I &s;hall add a few remarks.</P>
<P>We do not always &s;ee, in the human &s;emen,
the filaments I have mentioned: For this pur|po&s;e,
the liquor mu&s;t be examined the moment
it is extracted from the body; and even then
they do not uniformly appear. When the li|quor
is too thick, it pre&s;ents nothing but large
globules, which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed with a
common lens. When examined with the mi|cro&s;cope
they have the appearance of &s;mall oran|ges;
they are very opaque, and one of them oc|cupies
<PB N="209" REF="219">
the whole field of the micro&s;cope. The
fir&s;t time I ob&s;erved the&s;e globules, I imagined
them to be foreign bodies which had fallen into
the liquor. But, after examining different drops,
I found that the whole liquor was compo&s;ed of
the&s;e large globules. I ob&s;erved one of the
large&s;t and rounde&s;t of them for a long time.
At fir&s;t it was perfectly opaque: A little after,
I perceived on its &s;urface, about half way be|tween
the centre and circumference, a beautiful
coloured luminous ring, which continued more
than half an hour, then gradually approached
the centre, which became clear and coloured,
while the re&s;t of the globule remained opaque.
This light which illuminated the centre, re&s;em|bled
that which appears in large air-bubbles.
The globule now began to grow flat, and to
have a &s;mall degree of tran&s;parency: And, after
ob&s;erving it for three hours, I could perceive no
other change, no appearance of motion, either
internal or external. I imagined that &s;ome change
might happen by mixing the liquor with water.
The globules were indeed changed into a tran&s;|parent
homogeneous fluid, which pre&s;ented no|thing
worthy of remark. I left the &s;emen to
liquify of its own accord, and examined it at the
di&s;tance of 6, 12, and 24 hours; but found no|thing
like life or motion. I relate this experi|ment
to &s;how, that the ordinary phaenomena
are not always to be expected in &s;eminal fluids,
though they be apparently &s;imilar.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="220">
Sometimes all the moving bodies have tails,
e&s;pecially in the &s;emen of man, and of the dog;
their motion is not then very rapid, and appears
to be performed with difficulty. If the liquor
be allowed to dry, the tails or threads are fir&s;t
deprived of motion; the anterior extremity con|tinues
to vibrate for &s;ome time, and then all mo|tion
cea&s;es. The&s;e bodies may be long pre&s;erved
in this &s;tate; and, if a &s;mall drop of water be then
poured upon them, their figure changes; they
fall down into &s;everal minute globules, which
appear to have a &s;mall degree of motion, &s;ome|times
approaching each other, and &s;ometimes
trembling, and turning round their centres.</P>
<P>The moving bodies in the human &s;emen, and
in tho&s;e of the dog and bitch, re&s;emble each o|ther
&s;o &s;trongly, that it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h
them, e&s;pecially when examined immediately af|ter
they are taken from the body of the animal.
Tho&s;e of the rabbit appear to be &s;maller and
more active. But the&s;e differences and re&s;em|blances
proceed more from the different &s;tates
of the fluids during the time of examination,
than from the nature of the fluids them&s;elves,
which ought indeed to be different in different
&s;pecies of animals: For example, in the human
fluid, I have remarked large filaments, as repre|&s;ented
in Pl. 1. fig. 3. &amp;c. and I have &s;een the
moving bodies &s;eparate from the&s;e filaments,
from which they appeared to derive their origin.
But I could perceive nothing of this kind in the
<PB N="211" REF="221">
&s;emen of the dog. In place of di&s;tinct filaments,
it is generally compo&s;ed of a compact mucilage,
in which we with difficulty perceive &s;ome fila|mentous
parts; and yet this mucilage gives
birth to moving bodies &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the
human &s;emen.</P>
<P>The motion of the&s;e bodies continues longer
in the fluid of the dog, than in that of man,
which enables us more ea&s;ily to di&s;tingui&s;h the
change of form above taken notice of. The mo|ment
the fluid i&s;&s;ues from the body of the ani|mal,
we find mo&s;t of the animalcules po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of tails. In 12, 24, or 36 hours afterwards, al|mo&s;t
the whole tails di&s;appear; we then per|ceive
only oval bodies moving about, and gene|rally
with more rapidity than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The moving bodies are always below the &s;ur|face
of the liquor. Several large tran&s;parent
air-bubbles commonly appear on the &s;urface;
but they have no motion, unle&s;s when the li|quor
is agitated. Below the moving bodies we
often perceive others &s;till more minute: The&s;e
have no tails; but mo&s;t of them move: And, in
general, I have remarked, that, of the number|le&s;s
globules in all the&s;e liquors, the &s;malle&s;t are
generally blacker and more ob&s;cure than the o|thers;
and that tho&s;e which are extremely mi|nute
and tran&s;parent have little or no motion.
They &s;eem likewi&s;e to have more &s;pecific gravi|ty;
for they are always &s;unk deepe&s;t in the
fluid.</P>

<HEAD>Reflections on the preceding Experiments.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the foregoing experiments, it ap|pears,
that females, as well as males, have
a &s;eminal fluid containing bodies in motion;
that the&s;e moving bodies are not real animals,
but only organic living particles; and that the&s;e
particles exi&s;t not only in the &s;eminal fluids of
both &s;exes, but in the fle&s;h of animals, and in
the &s;eeds of vegetables. To di&s;cover whether
all the parts of animals and all the &s;eeds of plants
contained moving organic particles, I made in|fu&s;ions
of the fle&s;h of different animals, and of
the &s;eeds of more than twenty different &s;pecies
of vegetables; and, after remaining &s;ome days in
clo&s;e gla&s;&s;es, I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing organic
moving particles in all of them. In &s;ome they
appeared &s;ooner, in others later. Some pre&s;er|ved
their motion for months, and others &s;oon
lo&s;t it. Some, at fir&s;t, produced large moving
globules, re&s;embling animals, which changed
their figure, &s;plit, and became gradually &s;maller.
Others produced only &s;mall globules who&s;e mo|tions
were extremely rapid; and others produ|ced
<PB N="213" REF="223">
filaments, which grew longer, &s;eemed to vege|tate,
and then &s;welled, and poured out torrents
of moving globules. But it is needle&s;s to give
a detail of my experiments on the infu&s;ions of
plants, e&s;pecially &s;ince Mr Needham has publi&s;h|ed
his excellent and numerous ob&s;ervations on
this &s;ubject. To this able naturali&s;t I have read
over the preceding treati&s;e; I have often rea|&s;oned
with him on the re&s;emblance between the
moving bodies in infu&s;ions of the &s;eeds of vege|tables,
and tho&s;e in the &s;eminal fluids of male
and female animals. He thought my views well
founded, and of &s;ufficient importance to merit a
farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. He, therefore, began to
make experiments on the different parts of vege|tables;
and I acknowledge, that he has brought
the ideas I communicated to greater perfection,
than could have been done by me. Of this I
could give many examples: But I &s;hall confine
my&s;elf to one, becau&s;e I formerly pointed out
the fact in que&s;tion, which he de&s;cribes in the
following manner.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain whether the moving bodies which
appear in infu&s;ions of fle&s;h were real animals,
or only, as I had imagined, organic moving par|ticles,
Mr Needham thought that an examination
of the jelly of roa&s;ted meat would determine the
que&s;tion; becau&s;e, if they were animals, the fire
would de&s;troy them, and, if not, they would
&s;till be perceptible, in the &s;ame manner as when
the fle&s;h was raw. Having, for this purpo&s;e, ta|ken
<PB N="214" REF="224">
the jellies of veal and of other kinds of roa&s;t|ed
meat, he put them in gla&s;&s;es filled with water,
and carefully corked the bottles. After &s;ome days
infu&s;ion, he found in the whole of the liquors
an immen&s;e number of moving bodies. He
&s;howed me &s;everal of the&s;e infu&s;ions, and, among
others, that of the veal jelly, which contained
moving bodies very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of man, the
dog, and the bitch, after they had lo&s;t their tails
or threads. Though they changed their forms,
their motions were &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of animals
&s;wimming, that, whoever &s;aw them for the fir&s;t
time, or had been ignorant of what has been
formerly remarked concerning them, would
certainly have apprehended them to be real ani|mals.
I &s;hall only add, that Mr Needham has
e&s;tabli&s;hed, by numberle&s;s experiment, the exi&s;t|ence
of moving organic particles in all the
parts of vegetables, which confirms what I have
alledged, and extends my theory concerning the
compo&s;ition and reproduction of organized be|ings.</P>
<P>It is them apparent, that all animals, whether
male or female, and every &s;pecies of vegetable,
are compo&s;ed of living organic particles. The&s;e
organic particles abound mo&s;t in the &s;eminal fluids
of animals, and in the &s;eeds of vegetables. Re|production
is effected by the union of the&s;e or|ganic
particles, which are detached from all
parts of the animal or vegetable body, and are
always &s;imilar to the particular &s;pecies to which
<PB N="215" REF="225">
they belong; for their union could not be ac|compli&s;hed
but by the intervention of an inter|nal
mould, which is the efficient cau&s;e of the
figure of the animal or vegetable, and in which
the e&s;&s;ence, the unity, and the continuation of
the &s;pecies con&s;i&s;ts, and will invariably continue
till the end of time.</P>
<P>But, before drawing general conclu&s;ions from
the &s;y&s;tem I have e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ome objections
mu&s;t be removed, which will contribute &s;till
farther to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It will be demanded of me, why I deny the&s;e
moving bodies to be animals, after they have
uniformly been recognized as &s;uch by every man
who has examined them? It may likewi&s;e
be a&s;ked, How is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive the na|ture
of living organic particles, unle&s;s we allow
them to be real animals? And to &s;uppo&s;e an a|nimal
to be compo&s;ed of le&s;&s;er animals, is near|ly
the &s;ame idea, as when we &s;ay, that an orga|nized
body is compo&s;ed of organic living par|ticles.
To the&s;e que&s;tions, I &s;hall endeavour to
give &s;atisfactory an&s;wers.</P>
<P>It is true, that almo&s;t all ob&s;ervers agree in
regarding the moving bodies in the &s;eminal fluid
as real animals. But it is equally certain, both
from my experiments, and tho&s;e of Mr Need|ham
upon the &s;emen of the calmar, that the&s;e
moving bodies are beings more &s;imple and le&s;s
organized than animals.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="226">
The word <HI>animal,</HI> in its common acceptation,
repre&s;ents a general idea, compo&s;ed of particular
ideas which we derive from particular animals.
All general ideas include many different ideas,
which more or le&s;s approach or recede from one
another; and, of cour&s;e, no general idea can
be preci&s;e or exact. The general idea we have
formed of an animal, may be derived from the
particular idea of a dog, of a hor&s;e, and of other
animals, from the power of volition, which en|ables
them to act according to their inclination,
and from the circum&s;tances of their being com|po&s;ed
of fle&s;h and blood, from their faculty of
chu&s;ing and of taking nouri&s;hment, from their
&s;en&s;es, from the di&s;tinction of &s;exes, and from
their power of reproducing. The general idea,
therefore, expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>animal,</HI> includes
a number of particular ideas, not one of which
con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of the general idea: For
there are animals which have no intelligence,
no will, no progre&s;&s;ive motion, no fle&s;h or blood,
and appear to be only a ma&s;s of congealed mu|cilage:
There are others, which cannot &s;eek for
their food, and only receive it from the element
in which they exi&s;t; others have no &s;en&s;es, not
even that of feeling, at lea&s;t in a perceptible de|gree.
Some have no &s;exes, or have both in
one individual. There remains nothing, there|fore,
in the properties of an animal, but the
power of reproduction, which is common to
both the vegetable and animal. It is from the
<PB N="217" REF="227">
whole taken together that a general idea is
formed; and, as this whole is compo&s;ed of dif|ferent
parts, there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be degrees
or intervals between the&s;e parts. An in&s;ect, in
this &s;en&s;e, is le&s;s an animal than a dog, an oy&s;ter
than an in&s;ect, and a &s;ea-nettle, or a fre&s;h water
polype, than an oy&s;ter: And, as Nature proceeds
by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, we &s;hould find beings par|taking
of &s;till le&s;s animation than a &s;ea-nettle or
a polype. Our general ideas are only artificial
methods of collecting a number of objects un|der
one point of view; and they have, like o|ther
artificial methods, the defect of not being
able to comprehend the whole. They are in
direct oppo&s;ition to the procedure of Nature,
which is uniform, in&s;en&s;ible, and always parti|cular.
It is to gra&s;p a number of particular
ideas under one word, of which we have no
clearer notion than that word conveys; becau&s;e,
when the word is once received, we imagine it
to be a line drawn between the different pro|ductions
of nature; that every thing above this
line is an <HI>animal,</HI> and every thing below it a <HI>ve|getable,</HI>
which is another word equally general,
and employed as a line of &s;eparation between
organized bodies and brute matter. But, as has
already been remarked, the&s;e lines of &s;eparation
have no exi&s;tence in nature. There are bodies
which are neither animals, vegetables, nor mi|nerals,
and every attempt to arrange them un|der
either of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es mu&s;t be ineffectual.
<PB N="218" REF="228">
For example, Mr Trembly, when he fir&s;t exa|mined
the fre&s;h water polypus, &s;pent much
time before he could determine whether it was
an animal or a vegetable. The rea&s;on is plain;
this polypus is perhaps neither the one nor the
other; and all that can be &s;aid is, that it has
mo&s;t re&s;emblance to an animal: And, as we are
inclined to think, that every living being is ei|ther
an animal or a plant, we believe not the ex|i&s;tence
of any organized body, unle&s;s it falls un|der
&s;ome of the&s;e general denominations, al|though
there mu&s;t be, and in fact there are,
many beings which belong neither to the one
nor the other. The moving bodies found in
the &s;eminal fluids, and in infu&s;ions of the fle&s;h
of animals, as well as in tho&s;e of all parts of ve|getables,
are of this &s;pecies: We can neither
rank them under animals nor vegetables; and
no man in his &s;en&s;es will ever maintain them to
be minerals.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, pronounce, without he&s;i|tation,
that the great divi&s;ion of natural pro|ductions
into <HI>animals, vegetables,</HI> and <HI>minerals,</HI>
comprehends not all material beings; &s;ince be|ings
exi&s;t which can be included in neither of
the&s;e cla&s;&s;es. Nature pa&s;&s;es, by imperceptible
&s;teps, from the animal to the vegetable; but,
from the vegetable to the mineral, the pa&s;&s;age is
&s;udden, and the interval great. Here the law
of imperceptible degrees &s;uffers a violation. This
circum&s;tance made me &s;u&s;pect, that, by exami|ning
<PB N="219" REF="229">
Nature more clo&s;ely, we &s;hould find inter|mediate
organized beings, which, without ha|ving
the faculty of reproduction, like animals
and vegetables, would &s;till enjoy a &s;pecies of life
and motion; beings which, without being either
animals or vegetables, might enter into the con|&s;titution
of both; and, la&s;tly, beings which
would con&s;i&s;t of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;emblages of the or|ganic
particles mentioned in the preceding
chapters.</P>
<P>Eggs con&s;titute the fir&s;t cla&s;s of this &s;pecies of
beings. Tho&s;e of hens and other female birds
are attached to a common pedicle, and derive
their nouri&s;hment and growth from the body
of the animal. But, when attached to the ova|rium,
they are not properly eggs; they are only
yellow globes, which &s;eparate from the ova|rium
as &s;oon as they acquire a certain magnitude:
Such is their internal organization, however,
that they ab&s;orb nouri&s;hment from the lymph
contained in the uterus, and convert it into the
white, membranes, and &s;hell. Thus the egg po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
a &s;pecies of life and organization. It grows
and a&s;&s;umes a form by its own peculiar powers:
It neither lives like an animal, nor vegetates like
a plant, nor enjoys the faculty of reproduction.
The egg, therefore, is a di&s;tinct being, which
can neither be ranked with the animal nor mi|neral
kingdoms. If it be alledged, that the egg
is only an animal production de&s;tined for the
nouri&s;hment of the chick, and ought to be re|garded
<PB N="220" REF="230">
as a part of the hen; I reply, that eggs,
whether impregnated or not, are always organi|zed
in the &s;ame manner; that impregnation
changes only a part which is almo&s;t invi&s;ible;
that it grows, and acquires a uniform figure and
&s;tructure, both externally and internally, inde|pendent
of impregnation; and, con&s;equently,
it ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;eparate and di|&s;tinct
being.</P>
<P>This will be &s;till more apparent, if we attend
to the growth and formation of the eggs of
fi&s;hes. When the female depo&s;its them in the
water, they are properly but the rudiments of
eggs, which, being lately &s;eparated from the
body of the animal, attract and a&s;&s;imilate tho&s;e
particles that are fitted for their nouri&s;hment;
and thus increa&s;e in &s;ize by mere ab&s;orption.
In the &s;ame manner as the egg of the hen ac|quires
its white and membranes while floating
in the uterus, the eggs of fi&s;hes acquire their
white and membranes in the water; and,
whether they are fecundated by the male's
&s;hedding his milt upon them, or they remain un|impregnated,
they &s;till arrive at full perfection.
It is plain, therefore, that eggs in general ought
to be regarded as organized bodies, and forming
a di&s;tinct genus from animals and vegetables.</P>
<P>The organized bodies found in the &s;emen of
all animals, and which, like tho&s;e in the milt of
the calmar, are natural machines, and not ani|mals,
form a &s;econd &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus.
<PB N="221" REF="231">
They are properly the fir&s;t a&s;&s;emblages of tho&s;e
organic particles &s;o often mentioned; and, per|haps,
they are the con&s;tituent particles of all a|nimated
bodies. They appear in the &s;emen of
every animals, becau&s;e the &s;emen is only the re|&s;idue
of the organic particles which the ani|mal
takes in with its food. The particles, as
formerly remarked, a&s;&s;imilated from the food,
are tho&s;e which are mo&s;t organized, and the
mo&s;t analogous to the animal it&s;elf: It is of
the&s;e particles that the &s;emen con&s;i&s;ts; and, of
cour&s;e, we ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed to find or|ganized
bodies in that fluid.</P>
<P>To be &s;atisfied that the&s;e organized bodies are
not real animals, we have only to reflect upon
the preceding experiments. The moving bo|dies
in the &s;emen have been con&s;idered as real
animals, becau&s;e they have a progre&s;&s;ive motion,
and &s;omething &s;imilar to tails. But, after attend|ing,
on the one hand, to the nature of this mo|tion,
which is &s;uddenly fini&s;hed, and never again
commences, and, on the other, to the nature of
the tails, which are only threads adhering to the
moving body, we will begin to he&s;itate; for an
animal goes &s;ometimes &s;low, and &s;ometimes fa&s;t;
and it &s;ometimes &s;tops, and repo&s;es, without
moving at all. The&s;e moving bodies, on the
contrary, go always in the &s;ame direction at the
&s;ame time; I never &s;aw them &s;top and again
begin to move; and, if they once &s;top, it is for
ever. I demand, if this continued motion, with|out
<PB N="222" REF="232">
any repo&s;e, is common to animals; and if,
from this circum&s;tance, we ought not to doubt
concerning the real animation of the&s;e moving
bodies? An animal &s;hould always have a uni|form
figure, as well as di&s;tinct members: But
the&s;e moving bodies change their figure every
moment; they have no di&s;tinct members; and
their tails are only adventitious matter, and no
part of the individual. How, then, can they be
e&s;teemed real animals? In &s;eminal liquors, we
&s;ee &s;ilaments which &s;tretch out, and &s;eem to ve|getate;
then they &s;well and produce moving bo|dies.
The&s;e filaments are, perhaps, of a vege|table
nature; but the moving bodies which proceed
from them cannot be animals; for we have no
example of vegetables giving birth to animals.
Moving bodies are found in all animal and ve|getable
&s;ub&s;tances promi&s;cuou&s;ly. They are not
the produce of generation. They have no uni|formity
of &s;pecies. They cannot, therefore, be
either animals or vegetables. As they are to be
met with in every part of animals and of vege|tables,
but are mo&s;t abundant in their &s;eeds, is it
not natural to regard them as the organic living
particles of which animals and vegetables are
compo&s;ed, as particles which, being endowed
with motion, and a &s;pecies of life, ought to
produce, by their union, moving and living
beings, and, in this manner, form animals and
vegetables?</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="233">
But, to remove every doubt upon this &s;ubject,
let us attend to the ob&s;ervations of others. Can
the active machines di&s;covered by Mr Needham
in the milt of the calmar be regarded as animals?
Can we believe that eggs, which are active ma|chines
of another &s;pecies, are al&s;o animals? If
we examine Leeuwenhoek's repre&s;entations of
the moving bodies found in many different &s;ub|&s;tances,
will we not be &s;atisfied, at the fir&s;t in|&s;pection,
that they are not animals, &s;ince none
of them have any members, but are uniformly
either round or oval? If we attend to what this
famous ob&s;erver has remarked concerning the
motion of the&s;e pretended animals, we mu&s;t be
convinced that he was wrong in regarding them
as real animals, and we will be more and more
confirmed in the opinion, that they are only
organic moving particles. We &s;hall give &s;ome
examples. Leeuwenhoek<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 51.</NOTE>, gives the figure of
the moving bodies in the &s;eminal fluid of a male
frog. This figure repre&s;ents nothing but a thin,
long body, pointed at one of the extremities.
Let us attend to what he &s;ays concerning it:
'Uno tempore caput, (that is, the large&s;t ex|tremity
of the moving body), cra&s;&s;ius mihi
apparebat alio; plerumque agno&s;cebam ani|malculum
haud ulterius quam a capite ad
medium corpus, ob caudae tenuitatem, et cum
idem animalculum paulo vehementius move|retur
(quod tamen tarde fiebat) qua&s;i volumine
<PB N="224" REF="234">
quodam circa caput ferebatur. Corpus fere
carebat motu, cauda tamen in tres quatuorve
flexus volvebatur.' Here we have the change
of figure that I had ob&s;erved, the mucilage
from which the moving bodies with difficulty
di&s;engage them&s;elves, the &s;lowne&s;s of their mo|tion
before they e&s;cape from the mucilage, and,
la&s;tly, a part of the pretended animal in mo|tion
while the other is dead; for, a little after|wards,
he ob&s;erves, 'movebant po&s;teriorem &s;o|lum
partem, quae ultima, morti vicinia e&s;&s;e
judicabam.' All this is repugnant to the na|ture
of an animal, but exactly corre&s;ponds with
my experiments, excepting that I never &s;aw the
tail move but in con&s;equence of an agitation of
the body. Speaking of the &s;eminal fluid of the
cod, he &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 52.</NOTE>, 'Non e&s;t putandum omnia ani|malcula
in &s;emine a&s;elli contenta uno eodem|que
tempore vivere, &s;ed illa potius tantum vi|vere
quae exitui &s;eu partui viciniora &s;unt, quae
et copio&s;iori humido innatant prae reliquis vita
carentibus, adhuc in cra&s;&s;a materia, quam hu|mor
eorum efficit, jacentibus.' If the&s;e are
animals, why were they not all alive? Why
did tho&s;e only live which were in the mo&s;t fluid
part of the liquor? Leeuwenhoek did not ob&s;erve,
that the thick part, in&s;tead of being a humor
produced by the animalcules, is a mucilage
which gives birth to them. If he had diluted
the mucilage with water, he would at once have
<PB N="225" REF="235">
given life and motion to the whole. The mu|cilage
it&s;elf is often nothing el&s;e than a ma&s;s of
tho&s;e bodies, which begin to move as &s;oon as
they can di&s;engage them&s;elves; and, of cour&s;e,
this thick matter or mucilage, in&s;tead of being
a humour produced by the animalcules, is only
a congeries of the animals them&s;elves, or rather,
as formerly remarked, the matter of which they
are formed. Speaking of the &s;emen of the
cock, Leeuwenhoek, in his letter to Grew, &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 5.</NOTE>,
'Contemplando materiam (&s;eminalem) animad|verti
ibidem tantam abundantiam viventium
animalium, ut ea &s;tuperem; forma &s;eu externa
figura &s;ua no&s;trates anguillas fluviatiles refe|rebant,
vehementi&s;&s;ima agitatione movebantur;
quibus tamen &s;ub&s;trati videbantur multi et ad|modum
exiles globuli, item multae plan-ova|les
figurae, quibus etiam vita po&s;&s;et attribui,
et quidem propter carumdem commotiones;
&s;ed exi&s;timabam omnes ha&s;ce commotiones et
agitationes provenire ab animalculis, &s;icque
etiam res &s;e habebat; attamen ego non opi|nione
&s;olum, &s;ed etiam ad veritatem mihi per|&s;uadeo
has particulas, planam et ovalem &s;igu|ram
habentes, e&s;&s;e quaedam animalcula inter
&s;e ordine &s;uo di&s;po&s;ita et mixta, vitaque adhuc
carentia.' Here we have animalcules, in the
&s;ame &s;eminal fluid, of different forms; and I am
convinced, from my own experiments, that, if
Leeuwenhoek had ob&s;erved tho&s;e oval bodies
<PB N="226" REF="236">
with attention, he would have perceived that
they moved with their own proper force, and,
con&s;equently, that they were as much alive as
the others. This change of figure, it is true,
exactly corre&s;ponds with what I had ob&s;erved:
But it does not indicate a uniform &s;pecies of a|nimals;
for, in the pre&s;ent example, if the bo|dies
having the figure of a &s;erpent were genuine
&s;permatic animalcules, each of which was de&s;tined
to become a cock, and therefore implies a uni|form
and invariable organization, what was the
end and de&s;tination of tho&s;e of an oval figure?
He, indeed, afterwards remarks, that the&s;e oval
bodies might be the &s;ame with the &s;erpentine,
if we &s;uppo&s;e them rolled up in a &s;piral manner.
But &s;till, how is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive that an
animal, with its body in this re&s;trained po&s;ture,
&s;hould be able to move without extending it&s;elf?
I, therefore, maintain, that the&s;e oval bodies
were only the organic particles &s;eparated from
their threads or tails, and that the &s;erpentine
bodies were the &s;ame particles which had not
yet been deprived of the&s;e appendages, as I have
often remarked in other &s;eminal fluids.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Leeuwenhoek, who believed all the&s;e
moving bodies to be real animals, who e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
a &s;y&s;tem upon that foundation, and who af|firmed,
that &s;permatic animalcules were tran&s;|formed
into men and other animals, now &s;u&s;pec|ted
them to be only natural machines, or moving
organic particles. He never entertained a doubt,
<PB N="227" REF="237">
but that the&s;e animalcules contained the large
animal in miniature. He remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 67.</NOTE>, 'Progene|ratio
animalis ex animalculo in &s;eminibus ma&s;|culinis
omni exceptione major e&s;t; nam, etiam&s;i
in animalculo ex &s;emine ma&s;culo, unde ortum
e&s;t, figuram animalis con&s;picere nequeamus,
attamen &s;atis &s;uperque certi e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;umus
figuram animalis ex qua animal ortum e&s;t,
in animalculo quod in &s;emine ma&s;culo re|peritur,
conclu&s;am jacere &s;ive e&s;&s;e: Et quan|quam
mihi &s;aepius, con&s;pectis animalculis in

donec tale animal, cujus &s;emina ma&s;cula
tam magna erunt, ut in iis figuram creaturae
ex qua provenit agno&s;cere queam, invenire
&s;ecunda nobis concedat fortuna.' This op|portunity,
&s;o much de&s;ired by Leeuwenhoek,
happily occurred to Mr Needham. The &s;per|matic
animals of the calmar are three or four
lines in length, and are vi&s;ible without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of the micro&s;cope. Their whole parts
and organization are ea&s;ily perceived. But they
are by no means &s;mall calmars, as Leeuwen|hoek
imagined. They are not even animated,
though they have motion, but are only machines,
<PB N="228" REF="238">
which ought to be regarded as the fir&s;t union of
the organic particles.</P>
<P>Though Leeuwenhoek had not this opportu|nity
of undeceiving him&s;elf, he had, however,
ob&s;erved other appearances which ought to have
had this effect. He had remarked, for example,
that the &s;permatic animals of the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 1. p. 160.</NOTE>, often
changed their figure, e&s;pecially when the fluid
was nearly evaporated; that, when dead, they
had an opening in the head, which did not ap|pear
when they were alive; and that the head
was full and round, during the life of the pre|tended
animal, and flat and &s;unk after its death;
The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;hould have led him to he|&s;itate
concerning the real animation of the&s;e
bodies, and to think that the phaenomena cor|re&s;ponded
more with a machine which emptied
it&s;elf, like that of the calmar, than with the pro|perties
of an animal.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that the motion of the&s;e moving
bodies, the&s;e organic particles, is not &s;imilar to
the motion of animals, and that there is no in|tervals
in their movements. Leeuwenhoek, in
tom. 1. p. 168. makes preci&s;ely the &s;ame remark:
'Quotie&s;cunque,' &s;ays he, 'animalcula in &s;e|mine
ma&s;culo animalium fuerim contemplatus,
attamen illa &s;e unquam ad quietem contuli&s;&s;e,
me nunquam vidi&s;&s;e, mihi dicendum e&s;t, &s;i mo|do
&s;at fiuidae &s;upere&s;&s;et materiae in qua &s;e&s;e
commode movere poterant; at eadem in con|tinuo
<PB N="229" REF="239">
manent motu, et tempore quo ip&s;is mori|endum
appropinquante, motus magis magi&s;que
deficit, u&s;quedum nullus pror&s;us motus in illis
agno&s;cendus &s;it.' It is difficult to conceive,
that animals &s;hould exi&s;t, which, from the mo|ment
of their birth to their di&s;&s;olution, &s;hould
continue to move rapidly, without the &s;malle&s;t
interval of repo&s;e; or to imagine that the &s;per|matic
animals of the dog, which Leeuwenhoek
perceived to be as active on the &s;eventh day as
the moment they proceeded from the body of
the dog, &s;hould be able, during all this time, to
move with a celerity which no animal on earth
could per&s;i&s;t in for a &s;ingle hour, e&s;pecially when
the re&s;i&s;tence ari&s;ing from the den&s;ity and tena|city
of the fluid is taken into con&s;ideration. This
&s;pecies of continued motion, on the contrary,
has an exact corre&s;ondence to the nature of the
organic particles, which, like artificial machines,
produce their effects by a continued operation,
and &s;top immediately after the end is accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the numerous experiments made by Leeu|wenhoek,
he doubtle&s;s ob&s;erved &s;permatic animals
without tails. He even mentions them in &s;ome
places, and endeavours to explain the phaeno|menon.
For example, &s;peaking of the &s;emen
of the cod, he &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p. 150.</NOTE>, 'Ubi vero ad lactium ac|cederem
ob&s;ervationem, in iis partibus quas a|nimalcula
e&s;&s;e cen&s;ebam, neque vitam neque
<PB N="230" REF="240">
caudam digno&s;cere potui; cujus rei rationem
e&s;&s;e exi&s;timabam, quod quamdiu animalcula
natando loca &s;ua perfecte mutare non po&s;&s;unt,
tam diu etiam cauda concinne circa corpus ma|neat
ordinata, quodque ideo &s;ingula animalcula
rotundum reprae&s;entent corpu&s;culum.' It would
have been more &s;imple, and more agreeable to
truth, to have &s;aid, that the &s;permatic animals of
this fi&s;h &s;ometimes have tails, and &s;ometimes
have none, than to &s;uppo&s;e that the tails were
&s;o exactly would round their bodies as to give
them a &s;pherical figure. One would be apt to
think, that Leeuwenhoek had never fixed his
eyes upon, or de&s;cribed any moving but tho&s;e
which had tails; he has given figures of none
that wanted tails, becau&s;e, though they moved,
he did not regard them as animals. This is the
rea&s;on why all Leeuwenhoek's figures of &s;per|matic
animals are very &s;imilar, and all drawn
with tails. When they appeared in any other
form, he thought they were imperfect, or rather
that they were dead. Be&s;ides, it is apparent from
my experiments, that, in&s;tead of unfolding their
tails, wherever they are placed in circum&s;tances
proper for &s;wimming, as Leeuwenhoek in&s;i&s;ts,
the&s;e pretended animals gradually lo&s;e their tails,
in proportion to the rapidity of their motions,
till, at la&s;t, the&s;e tails, which are bodies foreign
to the animalcules, or threads which they drag
after them, totally di&s;appear.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="241">
Leeuwenhoek, &s;peaking of the &s;permatic ani|mals
of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 93.</NOTE>, &s;ays: 'Aliquando etiam ani|madverti
inter animalcula particulas qua&s;dam
minores et &s;ubrotundas; cum vero &s;e ea aliquo|ties
eo modo oculis meis exhibuerint, ut mihi
imaginarer eas exiguis in&s;tructas e&s;&s;e caudis,
cogitare coepi annon hae forte particulae fo|rent
animalcula recens nata; certum enim mihi
e&s;t ea etiam animalcula per generationem pro|venire,
vel ex mole minu&s;cula ad adultam pro|cedere
quantitatem: Et quis &s;eit annon ea
animalcula, ubi moriuntur, aliorum animalcu|lorum
nutritioni atque augmini in&s;erviant!' It
appears from this pa&s;&s;age, that Leeuwenhoek had
&s;een, in the human &s;emen, animalcules without
tails; and that he is obliged to &s;uppo&s;e them to
be recently born, which is directly the rever&s;e
of what I have ob&s;erved; for the moving bodies
are never larger than when they &s;eparate from
the filaments, which is the period that their mo|tion
begins: But, as &s;oon as they are fully di&s;en|gaged
from the mucilage, they become &s;maller,
and continue to dimini&s;h till their motion entire|ly
cea&s;es. With regard to the generation of the&s;e
animals, which Leeuwenhoek imagines to be cer|tain,
no ve&s;tige of copulation has been di&s;cerned
by the mo&s;t acute ob&s;ervers. It is purely a ran|dom
a&s;&s;ertion, as may be ea&s;ily proved from his
own experiments. He remarks, for example,
<PB N="232" REF="242">
with great propriety, that the milt of the cod<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 98.</NOTE>
is gradually filled with &s;eminal liquor; and that,
after the fi&s;h has &s;pent this liquor, the milt dries,
and leaves only a flaccid membrane, entirely
de&s;titute of every kind of fluid. 'Eo tempore,'
&s;ays he, 'quo a&s;ellus major lactes &s;uos emi&s;it, rugae
illae, &s;eu tortiles lactium partes, u&s;que adeo con|trahuntur,
ut nihil praeter pelliculas &s;eu membra|nas
e&s;&s;e videantur.' How &s;hould this dry mem|brane,
which contains neither &s;eminal liquor nor
animalcules, produce animalcules of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies
next &s;ea&s;on? If they were produced by a re|gular
generation, &s;uch a long interruption could
not take place, which, in mo&s;t fi&s;hes, continues
a whole year. To remove this difficulty, he af|terwards
remarks: 'Nece&s;&s;ario &s;tatuendum erit,
ut a&s;ellus major &s;emen &s;uum emi&s;erit, in lacti|bus
etiamnum multum materiae &s;eminalis gig|nendis
animalculis aptae reman&s;i&s;&s;e, ex qua ma|teria
plura oportet provenire animalcula &s;emi|nalia
quam anno proxime elap&s;o emi&s;&s;a fuerant.'
This &s;uppo&s;ition, that part of the &s;eminal liquor
remains in the milt for the production of &s;per|matic
animals the following year, is perfectly
gratuitous, and contrary to ob&s;ervation; for the
milt, during this interval, is nothing but a thin
dry membrane. But how will he explain a
phaenomenon that takes place in &s;ome fi&s;hes, and
particularly in the calmar, who&s;e &s;eminal liquors
are not only renewed every year, but even the
<PB N="233" REF="243">
membranes which contain them. Here neither
the milt nor the &s;eminal liquor are pre&s;erved till
the &s;ucceeding year; and, of cour&s;e, their regular
reproduction cannot be a&s;cribed to generation.
It is, therefore, apparent, that the&s;e pretended
&s;permatic animals are not multiplied, like other
animals, by generation; and this circum&s;tance
alone would entitle us to conclude, that the mo|ving
particles in the &s;eminal fluid are not real
animals. Leeuwenhoek, though he tells us, in
the pa&s;&s;age above quoted, that the &s;permatic a|nimals
are certainly propagated by generation,
acknowledges, however, in another place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 26.</NOTE>, that
the manner in which the&s;e &s;permatic animals are
produced, is exceedingly ob&s;cure, and that he
leaves to others the farther elucidation of this
&s;ubject. 'Per&s;uadebam mihi,' &s;ays he, &s;peaking
of the &s;permatic animals of the dormou&s;e, 'haecce
animalcula ovibus progna&s;ci, quia diver&s;a in
orbem jacentia et in &s;emet convoluta videbam;
&s;ed unde, quae&s;o, primam illorum originem de|rivabimus!
an animo no&s;tro concipiemus ho|rum

aut &s;extum pervenerint, eademque
animalcula tum demum vita donari, vel in
ju&s;tam &s;taturam excrevi&s;&s;e, illoque temporis
articulo generandi maturitatem ade&s;&s;e! &s;ed haec
<PB N="234" REF="244">
lampada aliis trado.' It is, perhaps, unnece&s;|&s;ary
to make many remarks on what Leeuwen|hoek
has here advanced. He &s;aw, in the &s;emen
of the dormou&s;e, &s;permatic animals which were
round and without tails; <HI>in &s;emet convoluta,</HI>
&s;ays he, becau&s;e he always &s;uppo&s;es that they
ought to have tails. He was formerly certain
that the&s;e animals were propagated by genera|tion:
Here he &s;eems to be convinced of the re|ver&s;e.
But, when he learned, that the vine|fretters
(<HI>pucerons</HI>) were propagated without co|pulation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 499. et tom. 3. p. 271.</NOTE>, he laid hold of this idea, in order to
explain the generation of &s;permatic animals.
'Quemadmodum,' &s;ays he, 'animalcula haec
quae pediculorum antea nomine de&s;ignavimus
(the pucerons) dum adhuc in utero materno
latent, jam praedita &s;unt materia &s;eminali ex
qua eju&s;dem generis proditura &s;unt animalcula,
pari ratione cogitare licet animalcula in &s;emi|nibus
ma&s;culinis ex animalium te&s;ticulis non
migrare, &s;eu ejici, quin po&s;t &s;e relinquant mi|nuta
animalcula, aut &s;altem materiam &s;emina|lem
ex qua iterum alia eju&s;dem generis ani|malcula
proventura &s;unt, idque ab&s;que coitu,
eadem ratione qua &s;upradicta animalcula ge|nerari
ob&s;ervavimus.' This &s;uppo&s;ition is not
more &s;atisfactory than the preceding; for, by
thus comparing the generation of &s;permatic a|nimalcule
with that of the vine-fretter, we di&s;|cover
not the rea&s;on why they are never &s;een in
<PB N="235" REF="245">
the human &s;emen till the age of 14 or 15; nor
do we learn whence they proceed, or how they
are yearly renewed in fi&s;hes, &amp;c. Notwith|&s;tanding
all the efforts of Leeuwenhoek to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the generation of &s;permatic animals, he
leaves the &s;ubject in the greate&s;t ob&s;curity, where
it probably would have for ever remained, if
we had not di&s;covered, by the preceding expe|riments,
that they are not animals, but organic
moving particles, contained originally in the
food, and found in va&s;t numbers in the &s;eminal
liquors of animals, which are the mo&s;t pure and
mo&s;t organic extracts derived from the food.</P>
<P>Leeuwenhoek acknowledges, that he did not
always find animalcules in the male &s;emen; for
example, in that of the cock, which he often
examined, he never but once &s;aw the eel-like
animalcules: And, &s;ome years after, he could
not di&s;cover the&s;e eels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See tom. 3. p. 370.</NOTE>, but found animalcules
with a large head and a tail, which his drawer
could not perceive. He likewi&s;e remarks, that,
during one &s;ea&s;on, he could not di&s;cover living
animals in the &s;eminal fluid of the cod<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 306.</NOTE>. All
the&s;e di&s;appointments proceeded from this cir|cum&s;tance,
that, though he &s;aw moving glo|bules,
he was unwilling to acknowledge them to
be animals, unle&s;s they had tails, though it is in
the form of globules that they mo&s;t generally
appear, either in &s;eminal fluids, or in infu&s;ions
<PB N="236" REF="246">
of animal and vegetables &s;ub&s;tances. In the
&s;ame place, he remarks, that, though he had of|ten
di&s;tinctly &s;een the &s;permatic animals of the
cod, he was never able to make his drawer per|ceive
them: 'Non &s;olum,' &s;ays he, 'ob eximi|am
eorum exilitatem, &s;ed etiam quod eorum
corpora adeo e&s;&s;ent fragilia, ut corpu&s;cula pa&s;|&s;im
dirumperentur; unde factum fuit ut non|ni&s;i
raro, nec &s;ine attenti&s;&s;ima ob&s;ervatione, ani|madverterem
particulas planas atque ovorum
in morem longas, in quibus ex parte caudas
digno&s;cere licebat; particulas has oviformes ex|i&s;timavi
animalcula e&s;&s;e dirupta, quod particu|lae
hae diruptae quadruplo fere viderentur
majores corporibus animalculorum vivorum.'
When an animal, whatever be its &s;pecies, dies, it
does not &s;uddenly change its form; from being
long like a thread, it does not become round like a
bullet; neither does it become four times as
large after death as before it. Not a &s;ingle ar|ticle
of what is advanced by Leeuwenhoek, in
this pa&s;&s;age, has the &s;malle&s;t corre&s;pondence to
the nature of an animal; but, on the contrary,
the whole agrees with a &s;pecies of machines
which, like tho&s;e of the calmar, bur&s;t and empty
them&s;elves, after having performed their func|tions.
To pur&s;ue this ob&s;ervation a little fur|ther:
He tells us, that he has &s;een the &s;permatic
animals of the cod under different forms, 'Mul|ta
apparebant animalcula &s;phaeram pellucidam
reprae&s;entantia, and of different &s;izes,' 'Haec
<PB N="237" REF="247">
animalcula minori videbantur mole, quam ubi
eadem antehac in tubo vitreo rotundo exami|naveram.'
This is an evident proof, that there
is nothing like a uniform and invariable &s;pecies
in the&s;e animalcules, and, con&s;equently, that they
are not animals, but only organic moving par|ticles,
which, by their different combinations,
a&s;&s;ume various figures and &s;izes. Of the&s;e or|ganic
particles, va&s;t numbers appear in the ex|tract
and in the re&s;idue of our food. The mat|ter
which adheres to the teeth, and which, in
healthy per&s;ons, has the &s;ame &s;mell with the &s;e|minal
fluid, is only a re&s;idue of our food. In it
we accordingly find a great quantity of the&s;e
pretended animals, &s;ome of which have tails,
and re&s;emble tho&s;e of the &s;eminal fluid. Mr
Baker has given figures of four &s;pecies of them,
which are all a kind of cylinders, ovals, or glo|bules,
&s;ome of them having tails, and others not.
But, after the &s;tricte&s;t examination, I am per|&s;uaded,
that none of them are real animals, and
that they are only, like tho&s;e in the &s;emen, the
organic living particles of the food appearing
under different forms. Leeuwenhoek, who
knew not how to account for the&s;e pretended
animals in the matter adhering to the teeth, &s;up|po&s;es
them to proceed from certain &s;pecies of
food, as chee&s;e, in which they previou&s;ly exi&s;t|ed;
but they are found among the teeth of e|very
per&s;on, whatever kind of food be eaten;
and, be&s;ides, they have no re&s;emblance to mites,
<PB N="238" REF="248">
or other animalcules which appear in corrupted
chee&s;e. In another place, he tells us that the&s;e
teeth-animals proceed from the ci&s;tern-water
which we drink, becau&s;e he ob&s;erved &s;imilar ani|mals
in rain-water, e&s;pecially when it had &s;tag|nated
upon leaden roofs. But, when we give
the hi&s;tory of micro&s;copic animals, we &s;hall de|mon&s;trate,
that mo&s;t of tho&s;e found in rain-water
are only organic moving particles, which divide,
unite, change their &s;ize and figure, and, in a word,
which can be made to move or to re&s;t, to live
or die, as often as we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;eminal fluids &s;pontaneou&s;ly dilute, or be|come
more liquid, when expo&s;ed to the air, or to
a certain degree of cold, than when they i&s;&s;ue
from the body. But they thicken upon the ap|plication
of a moderate degree of heat. I expo|&s;ed
&s;ome of the&s;e fluids to a degree of cold equal
to that of water ju&s;t beginning to freeze; but the
pretended animalcules &s;uffered not the lea&s;t in|jury
from it. They moved with equal activity,
and during the &s;ame length of time, as tho&s;e to
which no cold had been applied. But tho&s;e which
were expo&s;ed to a &s;mall degree of heat, &s;oon
cea&s;ed to move, becau&s;e the liquor thickened.
If tho&s;e moving bodies were animals, they dif|fered
in their nature and con&s;titution from all o|thers,
to whom a moderate degree of heat com|municates
force and motion, and upon who&s;e
bodies cold has the very oppo&s;ite effects.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="249">
Before leaving this &s;ubject, upon which I
have, perhaps, dwelt too long, I mu&s;t &s;till add
another remark, which may lead to &s;ome u&s;e|ful
conclu&s;ions. The&s;e pretended &s;permatic
animals, which are nothing but the organic
living particles of food, exi&s;t, not only in
the &s;eminal fluids of both &s;exes, and in the
remnants of food that adhere to the teeth, but
likewi&s;e in the chyle and in the excrements.
Leeuwenhoek, having met with them in the ex|crements
of frogs, and of other animals which
he di&s;&s;ected, was at fir&s;t greatly &s;urpri&s;ed; and,
not being able to conjecture from whence ani|mals
could proceed &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the &s;e|minal
liquor he had ju&s;t been examining, he
accu&s;es his own want of dexterity, and &s;uppo&s;es,
that, in diffecting the animal, he had inadver|tantly
opened the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els, and that the
&s;emen had in this manner been mixed with the
faeces. But, having afterwards ob&s;erved the
&s;ame phaenomenon in the faeces of other ani|mals,
and even in his own, he was then totally
non-plu&s;&s;ed. It is worthy of remark, that
Leeuwenhoek never found animalcules in his
own faeces, but when they were liquid. When|ever
his &s;tomach was out of order, and his belly
was loo&s;e, the animalcules appeared; but, when
his food was properly concocted, and his faeces
were hard, not a &s;ingle animalcule was to be
found, although he diluted the faeces with wa|ter.
The&s;e facts &s;eem perfectly to coincide
<PB N="240" REF="250">
with what we formerly advanced; for, when
the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines properly perform
their functions, the faeces are only the gro&s;s
dregs of the aliment, and all the nouri&s;hing and
organic particles are ab&s;orbed by the lacteal ve&s;|&s;els:
In this ca&s;e, we cannot expect to find or|ganic
particles in the faeces, which are &s;olely
compo&s;ed of the u&s;ele&s;s and inert part of our
food. But, when the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines,
from any indi&s;po&s;ition, allow the food to pa&s;s
without being properly dige&s;ted, then the orga|nic
particles mix with the faeces; and, when
examined with the micro&s;cope, we di&s;cover
them in the form of living organic bodies. Hence
we may conclude, that people who are troubled
with loo&s;ene&s;s &s;hould have le&s;s &s;eminal liquor,
and be le&s;s fitted for the purpo&s;es of generation,
than tho&s;e of a contrary habit of body.</P>
<P>I have all along &s;uppo&s;ed that the female fur|ni&s;hes
a fluid equally nece&s;&s;ary to generation as
that of the male. In the fir&s;t chapter, I endea|voured
to prove, that every organized body con|tains
living organic particles; and, in Chap. II.
and III. that nutrition and reproduction are ef|fects
of the &s;ame cau&s;e; that nutrition is per|formed
by ab&s;orption, or an intimate penetration
of organic particles through all parts of the
body; and that reproduction is effected by the
&s;uperplus of the&s;e &s;ame organic particles, col|lected
from every part of the body, and depo&s;it|ed
in re&s;ervoirs de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e. In
<PB N="241" REF="251">
Chap. IV. I have &s;hown how this theory applies
to the generation of man, and other animals
which have different &s;exes. Females being orga|nized
bodies, as well as males, they mu&s;t al&s;o
have &s;ome re&s;ervoirs for the reception of the
&s;urplus of organic particles returned from all
parts of their bodies. This &s;urplus, as it is ex|tracted
from every part of the body, mu&s;t ap|pear
in the form of a fluid; and it is this &s;luid
to which I have given the appellation of the fe|male
&s;emen.</P>
<P>This fluid is not inert, as Ari&s;totle pretends,
but prolific, and equally e&s;&s;ential to generation
as the &s;emen of the male. It contains particles
di&s;tinctive of the female &s;ex, as that of the other
&s;ex contains particles proper for the con&s;titution
of male organs; and each of them contain all
the other organic particles which may be re|garded
as common to both &s;exes: And hence,
from a mixture of the two, the &s;on may re&s;em|ble
his mother, and the daughter her father.
Hippocrates maintains, that the &s;emen con&s;i&s;ts
of two fluids, one &s;trong, which produces males,
and the other weak, which produces females.
But, as the &s;eminal fluid is extracted from every
part of the body, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how
the body of a female &s;hould produce particles
proper for the formation of male organs.</P>
<P>This liquor mu&s;t enter, by &s;ome way or other,
into the uterus of viviparous animals; and, in
oviparous animals, it mu&s;t be ab&s;orbed by the
<PB N="242" REF="252">
eggs, which may be regarded as portable ma|trixes.
Each of the&s;e matrixes, or eggs, con|tains
a &s;mall drop of the female fluid, in that
part which is called the cicatrice. This prolific
drop, when the female has had no communica|tion
with the male, a&s;&s;umes, as Malpighius ob|&s;erves,
the form of a mole or inorganic ma&s;s;
but, when it is penetrated by the &s;emen of the
male, it produces a foetus, which is nouri&s;hed
and brought to perfection by the juices of the
egg.</P>
<P>Eggs, therefore, in&s;tead of being common to
all females, are only in&s;truments employed by
nature for &s;upplying the place of uteri in tho&s;e
animals which are deprived of this organ. In&s;tead
of being active and e&s;&s;ential to the fir&s;t impreg|nation,
eggs are only pa&s;&s;ive or accidental parts,
de&s;tined for the nouri&s;hment of the foetus al|ready
formed in a particular part of this matrix
by the mixture of the male and female &s;emen.
In&s;tead of exi&s;ting from the creation, and each
including within it&s;elf an infinity of males and
females, eggs, on the contrary, are bodies com|po&s;ed
of a &s;uperfluous part of the food, which
is more gro&s;s, and le&s;s organic, than that of
which the &s;eminal fluid con&s;i&s;ts. The egg, in
oviparous females, an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;es
as the uterus and men&s;trual flux in the vivipa|rous.</P>
<P>To evince that eggs are only de&s;tined by na|ture
to &s;upply the place of an uterus in &s;uch ani|mals
<PB N="243" REF="253">
as are deprived of this organ, we have on|ly
to con&s;ider, that females produce eggs inde|pendent
of the male. The uterus, in viviparous
animals, is a part peculiar to the female &s;ex;
in the &s;ame manner, female fowls, who want
this organ, have the defect amply &s;upplied by
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive production of eggs, which nece&s;|&s;arily
exi&s;t in the&s;e females, independent of all
communication with the male. To pretend that
the foetus pre-exi&s;ted in the egg, and that eggs
are contained, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> within each other,
is equally ridiculous as to maintain that the
foetus pre-exi&s;ted in the uterus, and that the
uterus of the fir&s;t female contained all the uteri
that ever were or will be produced.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts have applied the term <HI>egg</HI> to
things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> very oppo&s;ite natures. Harvey, in
his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Omnia ex ovo,</HI> by the word <HI>egg,</HI>
when applied to oviparous animals, means only
the bag which includes the foetus and all its
appendages. He imagined that he perceived
the formation of this egg or bag immediately
after the junction of the male and female. But
this egg proceeded not from the ovarium of the
female: He even a&s;&s;erts, that he could not di|&s;tingui&s;h
the &s;malle&s;t alteration in the ovarium.
It is apparent, that there is not here the mo&s;t
di&s;tant analogy to what is commonly under&s;tood
by the word <HI>egg,</HI> unle&s;s, perhaps, the figure of
the bag might have &s;ome faint re&s;emblance to
that of an egg. Harvey, though he di&s;&s;ected
<PB N="244" REF="254">
many viviparous females, never could perceive
any change in their ovaria: He even regards
them as glands totally unconnected with the
purpo&s;es of generation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Harvey, Exercit. 64. and 65.</NOTE>, though, as we have
&s;een, they undergo very con&s;iderable changes.
This able anatomi&s;t was deceived by the &s;mall|ne&s;s
of the glandular bodies in animals of the
deer kind, to which his re&s;earches were princi|pally
confined. Conradus Peyerus, who made
many ob&s;ervations on the te&s;ticles of female
deers, remarks, 'Exigui quidem &s;unt damarum
te&s;ticuli, &s;ed po&s;t coitum foecundum, in alter|utro
eorum, papilla, &s;ive tuberculum fibro&s;um,
&s;emper &s;uccre&s;cit; &s;crofis autem praegnanti|bus
tanta accidit te&s;ticulorum mutatio, ut me|diocrem
quoque attentionem fugere nequeat<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Conrad. Peyer. Merycolog.</NOTE>.'
This author a&s;cribes, with propriety, the rea&s;on
why Harvey ob&s;erved no changes in the te&s;ticles
of the deer, to their &s;mallne&s;s. But he is wrong
when he tells us, that the changes he had re|marked,
and which had e&s;caped Harvey, never
happened but after impregnation.</P>
<P>Harvey was deceived in &s;everal other e&s;&s;ential
articles. He in&s;i&s;ts, that the &s;emen never enters
into the uterus, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible for it to
find admittance; and yet Verheyen found a
great quantity of male &s;emen in the uterus of a
cow, which he di&s;&s;ected &s;ix hours after copula|tion
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Verheyen, &s;up. anat. tra. 5. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The celebrated Ruy&s;ch informs us, that,
<PB N="245" REF="255">
in di&s;&s;ecting a woman who had been killed im|mediately
after the act of adultery, he found a
con&s;iderable quantity of male &s;emen, not only
in the uterus, but in the Fallopian tubes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ruy&s;ch The&s;. anat. p. 90. tab. VI. fig. 1.</NOTE>. Vali&s;|nieri
likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ures us, that Fallopius, and other
anatomi&s;ts, had di&s;covered male &s;emen in the u|teri
of &s;everal women. This point, therefore,
though denied by Harvey, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
po&s;itive te&s;timony of &s;everal able anatomi&s;ts, and
particularly by Leeuwenhoek, who found male
&s;emen in the uteri of many different &s;pecies of
females.</P>
<P>Harvey mentions an abortion, in the &s;econd
month, as large as a pigeon's egg, without any
appearance of a foetus. In this al&s;o he mu&s;t
have been deceived; for Ruy&s;ch, and &s;everal o|ther
anatomi&s;ts, maintain, that the foetus is di|&s;tingui&s;hable
by the naked eye, even in the fir&s;t
month of pregnancy. In the Hi&s;tory of the
French Academy, we have an account of a foe|tus
compleatly formed on the twenty-fir&s;t day
after impregnation. If, to the&s;e authorities, we
add that of Malpighius, who di&s;tingui&s;hed the
chick in the cicatrice immediately after the
egg i&s;&s;ued from the body of the hen, we cannot
he&s;itate in pronouncing that the foetus is form|ed
immediately after copulation; and, con&s;e|quently,
no credit is due to what Harvey &s;ays
concerning the increa&s;e of the parts by juxta-po|&s;ition;
&s;ince the&s;e parts exi&s;t from the beginning,
<PB N="246" REF="256">
and gradually expand till the foetus be perfectly
mature.</P>
<P>Graaf differs widely from Harvey in his ac|ceptation
of the word <HI>egg.</HI> He maintains, that
the female te&s;ticles are real ovaria, and contain
eggs &s;imilar to tho&s;e of oviparous animals, only
that they are much &s;maller, never fall out of the
body, nor detach them&s;elves till after impregna|tion,
when they de&s;cend from the ovarium into
the uterus. The experiments of Graaf have
contributed more to the belief of the exi&s;tence of
eggs, than tho&s;e of any other anatomi&s;t. They
are, notwith&s;tanding, totally void of foundation;
for this celebrated author, in the fir&s;t place, mi|&s;takes
the ve&s;icles of the ovarium for eggs, though
they are in&s;eparable from the ovarium, form a
part of its &s;ub&s;tance, and are filled with a &s;pecies
of lymph. 2. He is &s;till more deceived, when
he informs us, that the glandular bodies are on|ly
the coverings of the&s;e eggs or ve&s;icles; for it
is certain, from the ob&s;ervations of Malpighius
and of Vali&s;nieri, and from my own experi|ments,
that the glandular bodies contain no ve|&s;icles.
3. He is wrong in maintaining that the
glandular bodies never appear till after impreg|nation.
On the contrary, the&s;e bodies are uni|formly
found in all females, after the age of
puberty. 4. He errs in &s;uppo&s;ing that the glo|bules
which he &s;aw in the uterus, and which con|tained
the foetu&s;es, were the very ve&s;icles that
had de&s;cended from the ovarium into the uterus,
<PB N="247" REF="257">
and that, he remarks, had become ten times
&s;maller than when they were in the ovarium.
This circum&s;tance alone of their dimini&s;hed &s;ize
&s;hould have convinced him of his mi&s;take. 5.
He is not le&s;s unfortunate in maintaining that
the glandular bodies are only the coverings of
the fecundated eggs, and that the number of co|verings
or empty follicles always corre&s;pond
to the number of foetu&s;es. This a&s;&s;ertion is the
rever&s;e of truth; for, on the te&s;ticles of all fe|males,
we uniformly find a greater number of
glandular bodies, or cicatrices, than of foetu&s;es
actually produced; and they even appear in
tho&s;e which never brought forth. To this we may
add, that neither he, Verheyen, nor any other
per&s;on, ever &s;aw the egg in this pretended co|vering,
or in its follicle, though they have thought
proper to re&s;t their &s;y&s;tem upon that &s;uppo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>Malpighius, who di&s;tingui&s;hed the growth of
the glandular bodies in the female te&s;ticle, was
deceived when he imagined that he once or twice
di&s;covered the egg in their cavities; for this ca|vity
contains only a fluid; be&s;ides, after number|le&s;s
experiments, no man has ever been able to
di&s;cover any thing that had the mo&s;t di&s;tant re|&s;emblance
to an egg.</P>
<P>Vali&s;nieri, who is never deceived with regard
to facts, is wrong in maintaining that the egg
mu&s;t exi&s;t in the glandular body, though neither

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="247" REF="259">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="248" REF="260">
he, nor any man el&s;e, was ever able to di&s;cover
it.</P>
<P>Let us now attend to what may be e&s;teemed
the real di&s;coveries of the&s;e anatomi&s;ts. Graaf
was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered that the te&s;ticles of
females &s;uffered any change; and he was right
in maintaining that they were parts e&s;&s;entially
nece&s;&s;ary to generation. Malpighius demon&s;tra|ted,
that the glandular bodies gradually grew to
maturity, and that, immediately after, they were
obliterated, and left behind them only a &s;light
cicatrice. Vali&s;nieri illu&s;trated this &s;ubject &s;till
farther. He di&s;covered that the&s;e glandular
bodies were found in the te&s;ticles of all females;
that they were con&s;iderably augmented in the
&s;ea&s;on of love; that they increa&s;ed at the ex|pence
of the lymphatic ve&s;icles of the te&s;ticle;
and that, during the time of their maturity, they
were hollow and full of liquor. The&s;e are all
the truths we have learned concerning the pre|tended
ovaria and eggs of viviparous animals:
What conclu&s;ions are we to draw from them?
Two things appear to be evident: The one, that
no eggs exi&s;t in the te&s;ticles of females; the o|ther,
that there is a fluid both in the ve&s;icles of
the te&s;ticle, and in the cavity of the glandular
bodies; and we have demon&s;trated, in the pre|ceding
experiments, that this la&s;t fluid is the true
female &s;emen, becau&s;e it contains, like that of the
male, &s;permatic animals, or rather organic par|ticles
in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="261">
The &s;eminal fluid of females, therefore, be|ing
thus fully a&s;certained, after what has been
&s;aid, we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied that the &s;eminal fluid
in general is the &s;uperfluous organic part of our
food, which is tran&s;mitted from all parts of the
body to the te&s;ticles and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els of males,
and to the te&s;ticles and glandular bodies of fe|males.
This liquor, which i&s;&s;ues through the
nipples of the glandular bodies, perpetually be|dews
the Fallopian tubes, and may ca&s;ily find
admi&s;&s;ion into them, either by ab&s;orption, or by
the &s;mall aperture at their extremity, and in this
manner may de&s;cend into the uterus. But, on
the &s;uppo&s;ition of the exi&s;tence of eggs, which
are ten or twenty times larger than the aperture
of the tubes, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the po&s;|&s;ibility
of their being tran&s;mitted to the uterus.</P>
<P>The liquor &s;hed by females in the paroxy&s;m
of love, which Graaf &s;uppo&s;es to proceed from
lacunae about the neck of the uterus and the o|rifice
of the urethra, may be a portion of the
&s;uperfluous fluid that continually di&s;tills from the
glandular bodies upon the Fallopian tubes. But
perhaps this liquor may be a &s;ecretion of a dif|ferent
kind, and no way connected with gene|ration.
To decide this que&s;tion, micro&s;copic
ob&s;ervations would be nece&s;&s;ary; but <HI>all</HI> expe|riments
are not permitted even to philo&s;ophers.
I am inclined to think, that, in this liquor, the
&s;ame &s;permatic animals, or moving bodies, would
be found as appear in the fluid of the glandular
<PB N="250" REF="262">
bodies. Upon this &s;ubject, I might quote the
authority of an Italian phy&s;ician, who had an
opportunity of trying this experiment, which is
thus related by Vali&s;nieri<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"></NOTE>: 'Aggiugne il lo|dato
&s;ig. Bono d'avergli anco veduti (animali
&s;permatici) in que&s;ta linfa o &s;iero, diro co&s;i
voluttuo&s;o, che nel tempo dell' amoro&s;a zuffa
&s;cappa dalle femine libidino&s;e, &s;enza che &s;i po|te&s;&s;e
&s;o&s;pettare che fo&s;&s;ero di que' del ma&s;chio,'
&amp;c. If the fact be genuine, as I have no rea|&s;on
to doubt, it is certain that this liquor is the
&s;ame with that contained in the glandular bodies,
and, of cour&s;e, that it is a real &s;eminal fluid,
which e&s;capes through the lacunae of Graaf, &s;i|tuated
about the neck of the uterus.</P>
<P>Hence we may conclude, that the mo&s;t libidi|nous
females will be the lea&s;t fruitful, becau&s;e
they throw out of the body that fluid which
ought to remain in the uterus for the formation
of the foetus. We likewi&s;e learn why common
pro&s;titutes &s;eldom conceive; and why women
in warm climates, who have more ardent de&s;ires
than tho&s;e of colder regions, are le&s;s fertile.
But of this we &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to
treat.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine that the &s;eminal fluid
of either &s;ex &s;hould not be fertile, unle&s;s when it
contains moving bodies. But this point is &s;till
undetermined. The Italian phy&s;ician, mentioned
above, alledges, that he never found &s;permatic
<PB REF="263" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate X.</HEAD>

<PB N="251" REF="264">
animals in his &s;emen till he arrived at 40 years,
although he was the father of many children,
and continued, after the animalcules appeared,
to beget more.</P>
<P>The &s;permatic moving bodies may be regarded
as the fir&s;t a&s;&s;emblages of the organic particles
which proceed from all parts of the body; and,
when a great number of them unite, they become
perceptible by means of the micro&s;cope. But,
when the number united is &s;mall, the body they
form is too minute to be vi&s;ible, and no motion
will appear in the &s;eminal fluid, a ca&s;e which not
unfrequently happens. But a long train of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
experiments would be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;cer|tain
the cau&s;es of the different &s;tates in which
this fluid appears.</P>
<P>Of one thing I am certain, from repeated tri|als,
that a &s;eminal liquor, though no motion can
be perceived when it is fir&s;t taken from the bo|dy,
after being three or four days infu&s;ed in
water, produces as great a number of organic
moving particles, as another &s;emen, treated in
the &s;ame manner, which at fir&s;t contained va&s;t
multitudes. The&s;e moving bodies appear like|wi&s;e
in infu&s;ions of the blood, of the chyle,
of the fle&s;h, and even of the urine, as well as in
infu&s;ions of all parts of vegetables; and tho&s;e which
appear in all the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances, &s;eem to
have nothing peculiar to them. They all move
and act nearly in the &s;ame manner. If we will
have the&s;e bodies to be animated, it mu&s;t be al|lowed,
<PB N="252" REF="265">
that they are very imperfect, and ought
to be regarded only as the rudiments of animals,
or rather as bodies compo&s;ed of particles e&s;&s;en|tial
to the exi&s;tence of animals. As Nature's
productions are uniform, and advance by imper|ceptible
degrees, there is no improbability in
&s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of organized bodies which
properly belong not either to the animal or ve|getable
kingdoms.</P>
<P>However this matter may &s;tand, it is fully a|&s;certained,
that all animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances
contain an infinite number of living or|ganic
particles. The&s;e particles &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;|&s;ume
different forms, and different degrees of
activity, according to different circum&s;tances.
They are more abundant in the &s;eminal fluids of
both &s;exes, and in the &s;eeds of plants, than in a|ny
other part of the animal or vegetable. There
exi&s;ts, therefore, in vegetables and animals, a li|ving
&s;ub&s;tance which is common to them both;
and this &s;ub&s;tance is the matter nece&s;&s;ary to their
nutrition. The animal is nouri&s;hed by vegeta|ble
or animal &s;ub&s;tances; and the vegetable is
nouri&s;hed by the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances in a decompo|&s;ed
&s;tate. This common nutritive &s;ub&s;tance is
always alive and active. It produces an animal
or a vegetable, whenever it finds an internal
mould or matrix accommodated to the one or
the other, as has already been explained. But,
when this active &s;ub&s;tance is collected too abun|dantly
in a place where it has an opportunity of
<PB N="253" REF="266">
uniting, it forms, in the animal body, other li|ving
creatures, as the tape-worm, the a&s;carides,
the worms &s;ometimes found in the veins, in the
&s;inu&s;es of the brain, in the liver, &amp;c. Animals
of this kind owe not their exi&s;tence to the ge|neration
of individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. It
is, therefore, natural to think, that they are
produced by an extrava&s;ation of the organic
matter, or by an inability in the lacteal ve&s;&s;els
to ab&s;orb the quantity of it pre&s;ented to them.
But we &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to exa|mine
more in detail the nature of the&s;e worms,
and of other animals which are produced in a
&s;imilar manner.</P>
<P>When this organic matter, which may be con|&s;idered
as an univer&s;al &s;emen, is a&s;&s;embled in
great quantities, as in the &s;eminal fluids, and in
the mucilaginous part of the infu&s;ions of plants,
its fir&s;t effect is to vegetate, or rather to produce
vegetating beings. The&s;e zoophytes &s;well, ex|tend,
ramify, and then produce globular, oval,
and other &s;mall bodies of different figures, all of
which enjoy a &s;pecies of animal life; they have
a progre&s;&s;ive motion, which is &s;ometimes very
rapid, and &s;ometimes more &s;low. The globules
them&s;elves decompo&s;e, change their figure, and
become &s;maller; and, in proportion as they di|mini&s;h
in &s;ize, the rapidity of their motion in|crea&s;es.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes imagined, that the venom of
the viper, and even the poi&s;on of enraged ani|mals,
<PB N="254" REF="267">
might proceed from this active matter be|ing
too much exalted. But I have not yet had
lei&s;ure for experiments of this kind, nor for a|&s;certaining
the nature of different drugs. All I
can &s;ay at pre&s;ent is, that infu&s;ions of the mo&s;t
active drugs abound with moving bodies, and
that they appear &s;ooner in them than in other
&s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all micro&s;copic animals are of the &s;ame
nature with the moving bodies in the &s;eminal
fluids, and in infu&s;ions of animal and vegetable
&s;ub&s;tances. The eels in pa&s;te, in vinegar, &amp;c.
are all of the &s;ame nature, and derived from the
&s;ame origin. But the proofs and illu&s;trations
relative to this &s;ubject, we &s;hall re&s;erve till we
give the particular hi&s;tory of micro&s;copic a|nimals.</P>

<HEAD>Varieties in the Generation of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THE nutrition and the reproduction of a|nimals
and of vegetables, are thus effected
by the &s;ame matter. It is a &s;ub&s;tance univer&s;al|ly
prolific, and compo&s;ed of organic particles,
the union of which gives ri&s;e to all organized
bodies. Nature always works on the &s;ame &s;tock,
and this &s;tock is inexhau&s;tible. But the means
&s;he employs to give it value are various; and
the&s;e general varieties and affinities merit the at|tention
of philo&s;ophers, becau&s;e from them we
are enabled to account for particular exceptions
to the common plan of her operations.</P>
<P>In general, large animals are le&s;s prolific than
&s;mall ones. The whale, the elephant, the rhi|noceros,
the hor&s;e, man, &amp;c. produce but one,
and very rarely two, at a birth. But &s;mall ani|mals,
as rats, herrings, and in&s;ects, produce a
great number. Does this difference proceed
from the greater quantity of nouri&s;hment ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;upport the large animals than the
&s;mall, and from the former having a le&s;s pro|portional
quantity of &s;uperfluous nutritive par|ticles,
<PB N="256" REF="269">
capable of being converted into &s;emen,
than the former? It is certain, that the &s;mall
animals eat more, in proportion to their bulk,
than the large. But it is likewi&s;e probable, that
the prodigious increa&s;e of the &s;maller animals,
as bees, flies, and other in&s;ects, may be owing
to the extreme finene&s;s and delicacy of their or|gans
and members, by which they are enabled
to &s;elect the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and mo&s;t organic
parts of the animals and vegetables, from which
they extract their nouri&s;hment. A bee, which
lives upon the pure&s;t and mo&s;t refined parts of
flowers, receives from its food a greater propor|tional
quantity of organic particles than a hor&s;e,
who feeds upon hay, &s;traw, and the gro&s;&s;er parts
of vegetables. The hor&s;e, accordingly, produ|ces
but one at a time, while the bee produces
many thou&s;ands. The oviparous animals are,
in general, &s;maller than the viviparous, and they
are likewi&s;e much more prolific. The long time
that the foetus remains in the uterus of vivipa|rous
animals, is another ob&s;tacle to multiplica|tion:
During ge&s;tation, and the &s;uckling of the
young, no new generation can take place. But
the oviparous animals, which produce, at the
&s;ame time, both uterus and foetus, and throw
them out of the body, are almo&s;t perpetually in
a condition to reproduce; and it is well known,
that, if a hen be prevented from &s;itting, and be
fully fed, the number of her eggs may be great|ly
increa&s;ed. If hens lay not while they brood,
<PB N="257" REF="270">
it is becau&s;e they cea&s;e to eat; and for this pur|po&s;e
they leave not their ne&s;ts but once a day,
and even then for a very &s;hort time, le&s;t their
eggs &s;hould be injured by the cold. During this
operation, they take not above one tenth part of
their ordinary nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Animals which produce but one at a birth, ac|quire
nearly their full growth before they are fit
for generating. But tho&s;e which produce many,
generate before they are half grown. Man, the
hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the &s;heep, are incapable of gene|ration
till after they have nearly acquired the
greate&s;t part of their growth. It is the &s;ame
with pigeons and other birds that lay but a &s;mall
number of eggs: But tho&s;e that are more pro|lific,
as cocks and hens, fi&s;hes, &amp;c. begin to ge|nerate
much &s;ooner. A cock is capable of this
operation at the age of three months, when he
is not above one third of his full &s;ize. A fi&s;h,
which, in 20 years, will weigh 30 pounds, ge|nerates
the fir&s;t or &s;econd year, when it weighs
not, perhaps, more than half a pound. But ex|periments
are &s;till wanting to a&s;certain the growth
and duration of fi&s;hes: Their age may be di&s;|covered
by examining with a micro&s;cope the an|nual
rings or &s;trata of which their &s;cales are
compo&s;ed. But we are ignorant how far this
may extend. I have &s;een, in the Count de
Maurepas' ponds, carps which were well atte&s;ted
to be at lea&s;t 150 years old, and they appeared
to be equally active and lively as common carps.
<PB N="258" REF="271">
I will not &s;ay with Leeuwenhoek, that fi&s;hes
are immortal, or, at lea&s;t, that they cannot die
of old age. Every thing, in time, mu&s;t peri&s;h.
Whatever has an origin, a birth, or commence|ment,
mu&s;t arrive at a termination or death.
But fi&s;hes, by living in a uniform element, and
being &s;heltered from the injurious vici&s;&s;itudes of
the air, mu&s;t continue longer in the &s;ame &s;tate
than other animals, e&s;pecially if the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes,
as Bacon remarks, be the chief cau&s;es of the
de&s;truction of animated beings. But the prin|cipal
cau&s;e of the longevity of fi&s;hes is, that their
bones are &s;ofter than tho&s;e of other animals, and
do not perceptibly harden with age. The bones
of fi&s;hes lengthen, and turn thick without ac|quiring
more &s;olidity. But the den&s;ity of the
bones of other animals continually increa&s;es;
and, when their inter&s;tices are completely filled
and ob&s;tructed, the circulation of their fluids
cea&s;es, and death en&s;ues. But, in the bones of
fi&s;hes, this augmentation of &s;olidity, which is the
natural cau&s;e of death, proceeds in &s;uch an im|perceptible
manner, that they mu&s;t live very
long before they can feel any of the effects of
old age.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds covered with hair are vivipa|rous,
and tho&s;e covered with &s;cales are ovipa|rous.
The clo&s;e texture of the &s;hells or &s;cales
of oviparous animals prevents them from lo&s;ing
&s;o much matter by tran&s;piration, as makes its
way through the porous &s;kins of the viviparous.
<PB N="259" REF="272">
May not this retention of &s;uperfluous nouri&s;h|ment,
which cannot e&s;cape by tran&s;piration, be
one rea&s;on of the extraordinary fertility of the&s;e
animals, and of their being able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a long
time without food? All birds and flying in&s;ects
are oviparous, except &s;ome &s;pecies of flies which
produce their young alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Leeuwenhoek, tom. 4. p. 91.</NOTE>. The&s;e have no
wings immediately after their birth; but they
gradually &s;hoot out as the animal advances in
growth; and they are not in a condition to be
u&s;ed till it acquires full maturity. All &s;hell|fi&s;hes
are viviparous; and likewi&s;e tho&s;e reptiles
that have no feet, as &s;nakes and &s;erpents; they
change their &s;kins, which are compo&s;ed of &s;mall
&s;cales. The viper is but a &s;light objection to
this general rule; for it is not properly vivipa|rous.
It fir&s;t produces eggs, from which the
young are hatched: This operation is indeed
carried on and compleated in the body of the
mother; and, in place of laying the eggs, like
other oviparous animals, the viper hatches them
within the body. The &s;alamander, in which, as
Maupertuis remarks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad, ann&eacute;e 1727, p. 32.</NOTE>, both eggs and young are
found at the &s;ame time, is a &s;imilar exception in
oviparous quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t animals are multiplied and perpetuated
by copulation. But many animals, as the great|e&s;t
number of birds, propagate rather by a kind
of compre&s;&s;ion, than a proper copulation. Some
<PB N="260" REF="273">
birds, indeed, as the o&s;trich, the male duck, &amp;c.
have con&s;iderable members, and propagate by a
real intromi&s;&s;ion. Male fi&s;hes approach the fe|males
in the &s;ea&s;on of &s;pawning. They &s;eem
to rub their bellies again&s;t each other; for the
male often turns on his back to meet the belly
of the female. But no actual copulation takes
place. The part nece&s;&s;ary for this operation
does not exi&s;t; and the males only approach the
females for the purpo&s;e of &s;hedding the liquor
of their milts upon the eggs, which at that &s;ea|&s;on
drop from the females. The male &s;eems to
be more attached to the eggs than to the female;
for, when &s;he cea&s;es to throw out the eggs, the
male in&s;tantly abandons her, and follows, with
ardor, the eggs which are carried down by the
&s;tream, or di&s;per&s;ed by the winds. He pa&s;&s;es
and repa&s;&s;es a thou&s;and times over every place
where he finds eggs. It is not, &s;urely, for the
love of the mother that he makes all the&s;e move|ments:
He cannot even be &s;uppo&s;ed to know
her; for he has been often &s;een &s;hedding his
&s;emen promi&s;cuou&s;ly on all the eggs that came
in his way, without having ever met with the
female to which they belonged.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ome animals are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;exes,
and endowed with members proper for copula|tion.
There are others which likewi&s;e have &s;exes, but want the nece&s;&s;ary members. Others,
as &s;nails, have both members and &s;exes in each
individual. Others, as the vine-fretters, have
<PB N="261" REF="274">
no &s;exes, are equally fathers or mothers, and pro|duce
of them&s;elves without copulation. Though
they &s;eem to copulate at plea&s;ure, we are unable
to di&s;cover the u&s;e of their junction, or whether
it be really a &s;exual embrace; unle&s;s we &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e Nature to have endowed this &s;mall in|&s;ect
with generative faculties &s;uperior to tho&s;e of
any other &s;pecies of animals, and to have be|&s;towed
on every individual not only the power
of reproduction, but likewi&s;e the power of mul|tiplying
by &s;exual communications.</P>
<P>But, whatever varieties take place in the ge|neration
of different &s;pecies of animals, Nature
prepares the body for it by a new production,
which, whether it be external or internal, always
precedes generation: Immediately before the
&s;ea&s;on of impregnation, the ovaria of oviparous
animals, and the te&s;ticles of the females of the
viviparous, undergo a con&s;iderable change. The
oviparous animals produce eggs, which gradual|ly
increa&s;e in &s;ize, till they quit the ovarium
and fall into the canal of the uterus, where they
receive their white, their membranes, and their
&s;hell. This production marks the fecundity of
the female, and without which generation could
not be effected. In viviparous females, in the
&s;ame manner, one or more glandular bodies ap|pear
upon the te&s;ticles, which gradually grow
under the membranes that covers them. The&s;e
glandular bodies increa&s;e, and pierce, or rather
elevate the membrane of the te&s;ticle; and, when
<PB N="262" REF="275">
they arrive at maturity, a fi&s;&s;ure, or &s;everal little
holes, appear at their extremities, through which
the &s;eminal fluid e&s;capes, and falls into the ute|rus.
The&s;e glandular bodies are new produc|tions,
which always precede generation, and
without which it could not be effected.</P>
<P>Males undergo a &s;imilar change before they
are fit for the purpo&s;es of generating. In the
oviparous animals, the &s;eminal re&s;ervoirs are
filled, and &s;ometimes the re&s;ervoirs them&s;elves
are annually renewed. The milts of &s;ome fi&s;hes,
and particularly of the calmar, are renewed every
year. The te&s;ticles of birds, immediately be|fore
the &s;ea&s;on of their amours, &s;well to an e|normous
degree. The te&s;ticles of the males of
viviparous animals, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which have
&s;ea&s;ons, likewi&s;e &s;well con&s;iderably; and, in ge|neral,
the genitals of every &s;pecies &s;uffer an e|rection,
which, though it be external and ca&s;u|al,
may be regarded as a new production that
nece&s;&s;arily precedes the faculty of generating.</P>
<P>Thus, in all animals, whether male or female,
generation is always preceded by new produc|tions;
and, when there is properly no new pro|ductions,
&s;ome of the parts &s;well and extend to
a remarkable degree. In &s;ome animals, not on|ly
a new production appears, but their whole
bodies are renewed, before generation can be
effected; as happens in the &s;urpri&s;ing metamor|pho&s;is
of in&s;ects, which &s;eems to be intended
for no other purpo&s;e than to enable the&s;e ani|mals
<PB N="263" REF="276">
to propagate their &s;pecies; for their bodies
are full grown before they are transformed.
The in&s;ect, immediately before its transforma|tion,
cea&s;es to take nouri&s;hment; and it has no
organs proper for generation, no means of con|verting
the nutritive particles, with which it a|bounds
more than any other &s;pecies of animals,
into eggs, or a &s;eminal fluid. Hence the whole
of this great &s;urplus of nutritive particles at fir&s;t
unites and moulds it&s;elf into a form nearly re|&s;embling
that of the original animal. The ca|terpillar
becomes a butterfly, becau&s;e, having no
organs of generation, no re&s;ervoirs for contain|ing
the &s;uperfluous nutritive particles, and, con|&s;equently,
being incapable of producing minute
organic bodies &s;imilar to the animal it&s;elf, the
organic nutritive particles, which are always ac|tive,
a&s;&s;ume, by their union, the form of a but|terfly,
partly re&s;embling that of a caterpillar,
both internally and externally, excepting that
the parts of generation are unfolded, and ren|dered
capable of receiving and tran&s;mitting the
nutritive organic particles which form the eggs,
and individuals peculiar to the &s;pecies. The
individuals produced by the butterfly ought not
to be butterflies, but caterpillars; becau&s;e it was
the caterpillar that received the nouri&s;hment,
and becau&s;e the organic particles of this nouri&s;h|ment
mu&s;t therefore be a&s;&s;imilated into the form
of a caterpillar, and not of a butterfly, which is
only an occa&s;ional production of the &s;uperfluous
<PB N="264" REF="277">
nouri&s;hment that precedes the real production of
animals of this &s;pecies, and a method employed
by Nature to accompli&s;h the important purpo&s;es
of generation, &s;imilar to the production of glan|dular
bodies, and of milts, in other animals.</P>
<P>When the &s;uperabundant quantity of organic
nutritive particles is not great, as in man, and
mo&s;t large animals, generation does not take
place till the growth of the body is nearly com|pleted;
and even their prolific powers are limit|ed
to a &s;mall number of young: But, when the&s;e
particles are more abundant, as in birds, and o|viparous
fi&s;hes, generation is effected before the
animal be fully grown, and the production of
individuals is very numerous. When the quan|tity
of organic nutritive particles is &s;till greater,
as in in&s;ects, it fir&s;t produces a large organized
body, retaining the internal and e&s;&s;ential con&s;ti|tution
of the animal, but differing in &s;everal
parts, as the butterfly differs from the caterpil|lar;
and then it quickly generates an amazing
number of young, &s;imilar to the animal that fir&s;t
prepared the organic nouri&s;hment from which
they derived their origin. La&s;tly, when the
quantity of &s;uperfluous nouri&s;hment is very
great, and when the animal, at the &s;ame time,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the organs nece&s;&s;ary to generation, as
in the vine-fretters, it fir&s;t confers on each indi|vidual
the power of generating, and then a
transformation, like that which other in&s;ects
undergo: The vine-fretter becomes a flie; but
<PB N="265" REF="278">
it can produce nothing, becau&s;e it is only the
re&s;idue of the organic particles that had not
been employed in the production of the young.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all animals, man excepted, have cer|tain
annual &s;ea&s;ons appropriated to the purpo&s;es
of generation. To birds, &s;pring is the &s;ea&s;on of
love: Carps, and &s;everal other fi&s;hes, &s;pawn in
June and Augu&s;t. Pikes, and &s;ome other fi&s;hes,
&s;pawn in the &s;pring. Cats have three &s;ea&s;ons
annually, in the months of January, May, and
September. The roe-deer rut in December,
wolfs and foxes in January, hor&s;es in &s;ummer,
&s;tags in September and October; and almo&s;t all
in&s;ects generate only during the autumn. Some
animals, as the in&s;ects, are totally exhau&s;ted by
generation, and die &s;oon after it. Others, though
they die not, become feeble, are much ema|ciated,
and require a con&s;iderable time to re|pair
the great wa&s;te of their organic &s;ub&s;tance.
Others are le&s;s affected, and are capable of
frequently renewing their amours; la&s;tly, man
is very little affected, or, rather, he quick|ly
repairs the lo&s;s, and therefore is, at all
times, in a condition for propagating. All the&s;e
varieties &s;olely depend on the particular con|&s;truction
of the animal organs. The limits fix|ed
by Nature upon the modes of exi&s;ting are e|qually
con&s;picuous in the manner of taking and
dige&s;ting the food, in the means employed for
retaining or throwing it out of the body, and in
the in&s;truments by which the organic particles
<PB N="266" REF="279">
nece&s;&s;ary to reproduction are extracted. And,
upon the whole, it is apparent, that every thing
exi&s;ts which can exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The times of the ge&s;tation of females are e|qually
various: Some, as mares, carry their
young from eleven to twelve months; others, as
women, cows, and hinds, carry their young nine
months; others, as foxes and wolves, carry five
months; bitches carry nine weeks, cats &s;ix weeks,
and rabbits thirty-one days. Mo&s;t birds are
hatched in twenty-one days; though &s;ome of
them, as the thi&s;tle-finches, hatch in thirteen or
fourteen days. Here the variety is equally great
as in every other part of the oeconomy of ani|mals:
The large&s;t animals produce fewer young,
and carry them longe&s;t; which confirms the doc|trine,
that the quantity of organic nouri&s;hment
is proportionally le&s;s in large than in &s;mall ani|mals;
for the foetus derives its growth and the
expan&s;ion of its parts from the &s;uperfluous nou|ri&s;hment
of the mother; and, as this growth
requires longer time in large than in &s;mall
animals, it is a proof that the quantity of or|ganic
particles is not &s;o great in the former as in
the latter.</P>
<P>Animals, therefore, are much diver&s;i&s;ied as to
the time and manner of ge&s;tation, of engender|ing,
and of producing; and this variety origi|nates
from the very cau&s;es of generation. For,
though the organic matter, which is common to
every thing that lives or vegetates, be the gene|ral
<PB N="267" REF="280">
principle of reproduction, the manner of its
union, and the combinations it forms, mu&s;t be
infinitely varied, that the whole may become the
&s;ources of new productions. My experiments
clearly demon&s;trate, that there are no pre-exi&s;t|ing
germs, and that the generation of animals
and vegetables is not univocal. There are, per|haps,
as many beings, which either live or vege|tate,
produced by a fortuitous a&s;&s;emblage of or|ganic
particles, as by a con&s;tant and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
generation. It is to &s;uch productions that we
ought to apply the axiom of the antients, <HI>Cor|ruptio
unius, generatio alterius.</HI> The corruption
and re&s;olution of animals and vegetables pro|duce
an infinite variety of organized bodies:
Some of them, as tho&s;e of the calmar, are only
a kind of machines, which, though exceedingly
&s;imple, are very active. Others, as the &s;per|matic
animalcules, &s;eem to imitate the move|ments
of animals. Others re&s;emble vegetables
in their manner of growth and expan&s;ion. There
are others, as tho&s;e of blighted wheat, which, at
plea&s;ure, can be made alternately to live or to die;
and it is difficult to know to what they &s;hould
be compared. There are &s;till others, and in great
numbers, which are at fir&s;t a kind of animals,
then become a &s;pecies of vegetables, and again
return alternately to their vegetable &s;tate. The
more we examine this &s;pecies of organized bo|dies,
we &s;hall probably di&s;cover greater and more
&s;ingular varieties of them, in proportion as they
<PB N="268" REF="281">
are farther removed from our ob&s;ervation, and
from the &s;tructure of other animals with which
we are already acquainted.</P>
<P>For example, blighted corn, which is effected
by an alteration or re&s;olution of the organic
&s;ub&s;tance of the grain, is compo&s;ed of multitudes
of &s;mall organized bodies re&s;embling eels. When
infu&s;ed in water for ten or twelve hours, we
di&s;cover them to have a di&s;tinct wreathing, and
a &s;mall degree of progre&s;&s;ive motion. They
cea&s;e to move as &s;oon as the water fails them;
and their motion commences upon the addition
of fre&s;h water: This alternate death and revivi&s;|cence
may be repeated for months, and even for
years; &s;o that the&s;e &s;mall machines may be made
to act as long and as often as we plea&s;e, without
de&s;troying or dimini&s;hing their force. They
are a &s;pecies of machines, which begin to act
whenever they are immer&s;ed in a fluid. The&s;e fi|laments
&s;ometimes open like the filaments of the
&s;emen, and produce moving globules: We
may, therefore, conclude them to be of the &s;ame
nature, excepting that they are more fixed and
&s;olid.</P>
<P>The eels in pa&s;te have no other origin than
the union of the organic particles of the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential parts of the grain. The fir&s;t eels which
appear are certainly not produced by other eels;
but, though they are not propagated them&s;elves,
they fail not to engender other living eels. By
cutting them with the point of a lancet, we di&s;|cover
<PB N="269" REF="282">
&s;maller eels i&s;&s;uing in great numbers out
of their bodies. The body of this animal &s;eems
to be only a &s;heath or &s;ac containing a multitude
of &s;maller animals, which perhaps are other
&s;heaths of the &s;ame kind, in which the organic
matter is a&s;&s;imilated into the form of eels.</P>
<P>A great number of experiments would &s;till
be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e animals, which
are &s;o &s;ingular and &s;o little under&s;tood, into cla&s;&s;es
and genera. Some of them may be regarded
as real zoophytes, which enjoy a kind of vege|tation,
and which, at the &s;ame time, &s;eem to wreath
and move like animals. Others appear, at fir&s;t,
to be animals, and then join and form a &s;pecies
of vegetables. A &s;mall attention to the re&s;olu|tion
of a &s;ingle grain of corn will elucidate, at
lea&s;t in part, what I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject. I
might add other examples; but tho&s;e I have gi|ven
were only produced for the purpo&s;e of exhi|biting
the varieties of generation. There are
unque&s;tionably &s;everal organized bodies which we
con&s;ider as real animals, but which are not engen|dered
by others of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Some of
them are only a kind of machines; and &s;ome
of the&s;e machines have a certain limited effect,
and act only for a certain time, as the machines
in the milt of the calmar; others may be made
to act as long and as often as we plea&s;e, as tho&s;e
of blighted grain. There are vegetables which
produce animated bodies, as the filaments of the
human &s;emen, from which active globules i&s;&s;ue
<PB N="270" REF="283">
and move by their own powers. In the corrup|tion,
the fermentation, or rather in the re&s;olu|tion
of animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, we find
real animals capable of propagating their &s;pecies,
though they were not them&s;elves produced in
this manner. The&s;e varieties are, perhaps, more
exten&s;ive than we imagine. Though it be right
to generalize our ideas, to a&s;&s;emble the effects of
Nature under one point of view, and to cla&s;s her
productions; yet numberle&s;s &s;hades, and even
degrees, in the great &s;cale of being, will always
e&s;cape our ob&s;ervation.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="284">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Formation of the Foetus.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the experiments of Verheyen, who
found the &s;emen of the bull in the uterus
of a cow, and from tho&s;e of Ruy&s;ch, Fallopius,
and Leeuwenhoek, who di&s;covered male &s;emen
in the uteri of women and many other animals,
it &s;eems to be a point fully a&s;certained, that the
&s;emen of the male enters into the uterus of the
female. It is probable, that, during the time of
coition, the orifice of the uterus opens for the
reception of the &s;eminal fluid: But, though this
&s;hould not happen, the active and prolific part
of the &s;emen may penetrate the membranes and
&s;ub&s;tance of the uterus it&s;elf; for, as the &s;emi|nal
liquor, as formerly remarked, is almo&s;t en|tirely
compo&s;ed of organic particles, which are
very active, and extremely minute, they may
pa&s;s with the utmo&s;t facility through the mem|branes
and &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus.</P>
<P>What proves that the active part of this fluid
may pa&s;s through the pores and &s;ub&s;tance of
the uterus, is the &s;udden change it undergoes
immediately after conception. The men&s;es are
<PB N="272" REF="285">
ob&s;tructed, the uterus becomes flaccid, &s;wells,
and appears to be inflated. All the&s;e changes
mu&s;t be effected by an active external cau&s;e, by
the penetration of part of the &s;eminal fluid into
the &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus. This penetration is
not confined to the &s;urface; it extends through
all the ve&s;&s;els and parts of which the uterus is
compo&s;ed, like that penetration by which nu|trition,
and the expan&s;ion of the body is pro|duced.</P>
<P>We &s;hall the more ea&s;ily believe this to be the
ca&s;e, when we reflect, that, during the time of
ge&s;tation, the uterus not only augments in &s;ize,
but even in its quantity of matter, and that it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;pecies of life, or rather of vegetation,
which continues till the child be delivered. If
the uterus were only a &s;ac, a re&s;ervoir for re|ceiving
the &s;emen and retaining the foetus, it
would extend and dimini&s;h in thickne&s;s, in pro|portion
as the foetus grew larger. But the aug|mentation
of the uterus is not a &s;imple exten|&s;ion
or dilatation of its parts. It not only extends
as the foetus enlarges, but it acquires, at the
&s;ame time, an additional thickne&s;s and &s;olidity;
or, in other words, both its &s;ize and quantity of
matter are greatly increa&s;ed. This augmenta|tion
is a real growth or increa&s;e of &s;ub&s;tance,
&s;imilar to the expan&s;ion of the body in young
animals, which could not be effected but by an
intimate penetration of organic particles analo|gous
to the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e parts. As this
<PB N="273" REF="286">
expan&s;ion of the uterus never happens but after
impregnation, the &s;eminal liquor mu&s;t be the
cau&s;e by which it is produced; for the uterus is
con&s;iderably augmented before the foetus has
acquired bulk enough to dilate it by pre&s;&s;ing a|gain&s;t
its internal &s;urface.</P>
<P>It appears, from my own experiments, to be
equally certain, that the female has a &s;eminal
fluid, which begins to be formed in the te&s;ticles,
and is brought to maturity in the glandular bo|dies.
This fluid perpetually di&s;tills through the
&s;mall apertures in the extremities of the&s;e bo|dies,
and, like that of the male, enters the uterus
by two different ways, either through the aper|tures
at the extremities of the horns of the ute|rus,
or by piercing through the &s;ub&s;tance of the
uterus it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;eminal fluids are extracts from all
parts of the body; and a mixture of them is all
that is nece&s;&s;ary for the formation of a certain
number of males and females. The more any
animal abounds in this &s;eminal fluid, or the more
it abounds in organic particles, the number of
young is the greater, as may be remarked in the
&s;maller animals; and the number of young di|mini&s;hes
in proportion as the organic particles
are le&s;s abundant, as is the ca&s;e with the larger
animals.</P>
<P>But, before taking any farther notice of other
animals, we &s;hall examine with attention the
formation of the human foetus. In mankind,
as well as in the larger &s;pecies of animals, the
<PB N="274" REF="287">
quantity of organic particles in the male and fe|male
&s;emen is not great, and, accordingly, they
very &s;eldom produce above one foetus at a time.
This foetus is either a male or a female, accor|ding
as the number of organic particles predo|minates
in the male or in the female fluid; and
the child re&s;embles the father or the mother
mo&s;t, according to the proportional quantities of
male or female organic particles in the mixture
of the two liquors.</P>
<P>I conceive, therefore, that the &s;eminal fluids,
both of the male and of the female, are equally
active, and equally nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of
propagation: And this, I think, is fully proven
by my experiments; for I found in both fluids
the &s;ame moving bodies; I di&s;covered that the
male fluid enters into the uterus, where it meets
with the fluid of the female; that the&s;e two
fluids are perfectly analogous; and that they are
compo&s;ed of parts not only &s;imilar in their form,
but in their action and movements<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. VI.</NOTE>. Now, I
imagine, that, by the mixture of the two fluids,
the activity of the organic particles proper to
each is &s;topped; that the action of the one coun|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">alances the action of the other; that each or|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ic
particle, by cea&s;ing to move, remains fixed
in the place which corre&s;ponds to its nature; and
that this place can be no other than that which
it formerly occupied in the body of the animal
from which it was extracted. Thus all the orga|nic
particles which were detached from the head
<PB N="275" REF="288">
of the animal, will arrange them&s;elves in a &s;i|milar
order in the head of the foetus. Tho&s;e
which proceeded from the back bone, will di&s;po&s;e
them&s;elves in an order corre&s;ponding to the
&s;tructure and po&s;ition of the vertebrae. In the
&s;ame manner, the organic particles which had
been detached from any part of the body, will
naturally a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame po&s;ition, and arrange
them&s;elves in the &s;ame order that they ob&s;erved
before they were &s;eparated from that part. Of
cour&s;e, the&s;e particles will nece&s;&s;arily form a
&s;mall organized body, entirely &s;imilar to the ani|mal
from which they originally proceeded.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that this mixture of
the organic particles of both &s;exes contains par|ticles
that are &s;imilar, and particles that are di&s;|&s;imilar.
The &s;imilar particles are tho&s;e which
have been detached from all the parts that are
common to the two &s;exes. The di&s;&s;imilar particles
are tho&s;e which have been &s;eparated from the parts
that di&s;tingui&s;h the two &s;exes. In this mixture,
therefore, there is a double portion of particles de|&s;tined
for the formation of the head, the heart, and
&s;uch parts as are common to both &s;exes; while
there are no more than what are nece&s;&s;ary for the
production of the &s;exual parts. Now, the &s;imilar
particles may act upon each other without pro|ducing
any di&s;order; and they may unite in the
&s;ame manner as if they had proceeded from the
&s;ame body. But the di&s;&s;imilar parts cannot act
upon each other, nor form any intimate union,
becau&s;e they have no analogy or relation: Hence
<PB N="276" REF="289">
the&s;e particles will pre&s;erve their original nature
without any mixture, will fir&s;t fix their po&s;ition,
without the nece&s;&s;ity of being penetrated by o|thers.
Thus the particles which proceed from
the &s;exual parts will be fir&s;t fixed, and tho&s;e that
are common to the two &s;exes, whether they be|long
to the male or to the female, will then &s;ix
indi&s;criminately, and form an organized body,
which, in its &s;exual parts, will perfectly re&s;emble
the father, if it be a male, and the mother, if it
be a female, but, which, in the other parts, may
re&s;emble either or both.</P>
<P>If what I have advanced be properly under|&s;tood,
we &s;hall, perhaps, be able to obviate an
objection made to the &s;y&s;tem of Ari&s;totle, and
which might al&s;o be urged again&s;t the doctrine
which I am now e&s;tabli&s;hing. The que&s;tion is,
Why is not every individual, both male and fe|male,
endowed with the faculty of producing an
animal of its own &s;ex? I am aware of the diffi|culty
of &s;olving this que&s;tion, which I have
&s;lightly mentioned in the fifth chapter, and &s;hall
now proceed farther to illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>From what is delivered in the fir&s;t four chap|ters,
and from the experiments I have de&s;cribed,
it is apparent, that reproduction is effected by
the a&s;&s;emblage and union of the organic par|ticles,
detached from every part of the animal or
vegetable body, in one or &s;everal common re|&s;ervoirs;
that the&s;e particles are the &s;ame which
&s;erve for the nutrition and expan&s;ion of the
<PB N="277" REF="290">
body; and that both effects are produced by the
&s;ame matter, and by the &s;ame laws. I think I have
e&s;tabli&s;hed this point by &s;o many facts and rea|&s;onings,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to entertain a doubt
concerning its truth. But, I allow, that the
que&s;tion may be put, Why every &s;eparate animal
and vegetable produces not its own likene&s;s,
&s;ince every individual detaches from all its parts,
and collects in a common re&s;ervoir, the organic
particles nece&s;&s;ary for the formation of a &s;mall
organized body? Why is not this organized
body formed? and why, in mo&s;t animals, is a
mixture of the fluids of both &s;exes nece&s;&s;ary?
If I were to reply, that in all the vegetable tribes,
in all tho&s;e animals that multiply by cutting,
and in the vine-fretters, which produce without
any &s;exual commerce, the general intention of
Nature &s;eems to be, that each individual &s;hould
multiply its own &s;pecies, and that reproduction
by the intervention of &s;exes is only an exception
to this general law. It might, with propriety,
be rejoined, that the exception is perhaps more
univer&s;al than the rule it&s;elf. To maintain that
all individuals would have the faculty of re|producing,
if they were endowed with proper
organs, and if they contained the matter nece&s;|&s;ary
for nouri&s;hing the embryo, is not removing
the difficulty: For, in females, all the&s;e circum|&s;tances
concur; and yet the influence of the
male is indi&s;pen&s;ible to the production either of
a female or of a male foetus.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="291">
But, we come nearer a &s;olution of the que&s;|tion,
when we maintain, that, though the fluid
in the te&s;ticles and &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els of the male
contain all the organic particles nece&s;&s;ary for the
formation of a male foetus, yet the&s;e particles
cannot receive any local e&s;tabli&s;hment or ar|rangement
of parts, becau&s;e a con&s;tant circula|tion
of them goes on by means of ab&s;orption,
and by the perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new &s;upplies
from all parts of the body; and that, as the
&s;ame circulation of the organic particles takes
place in the female, neither of them can po&s;|&s;ibly
multiply without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
other; becau&s;e, in the mixture of the male and
female fluids, the different organic particles of
which they con&s;i&s;t have a greater affinity to
each other than they have to the body of the
female where the mixture happens. But, though
this explication were admitted, why, it may &s;till
be a&s;ked, does not the ordinary mode of gene|ration
corre&s;pond with it? For, upon this &s;up|po&s;ition,
each individual would produce, and,
like &s;nails, mutually impregnate one another,
every individual receiving the organic particles
furni&s;hed by the other, which, without being
injured by any other power, would unite &s;olely
by the affinity between the particles them&s;elves.
If there were no other cau&s;e by which the or|ganic
particles could be united, perhaps this
mode of generation would be the mo&s;t &s;imple.
But it is contrary to the analogy of Nature.
<PB N="279" REF="292">
Few animals are endowed, like &s;nails, with both
&s;exes; and, therefore, if this mode of propa|gating
were the mo&s;t &s;imple, it would be more
generally employed by Nature. This &s;olution,
of cour&s;e, amounts to no more than a gratuitous
&s;uppo&s;ition, that males produce not, &s;olely be|cau&s;e
they have not organs proper for contain|ing
and nouri&s;hing a foetus.</P>
<P>It may be &s;till farther &s;uppo&s;ed, that the acti|vity
of the organic particles in the &s;emen of each
individual requires to be counterbalanced by the
force or action of tho&s;e of the other individual,
in order to reduce them to a fixed &s;tate, or e|quilibrium,
without which the formation of the
foetus cannot be effected; and that the motion
of the organic particles of the female cannot be
counterbalanced by any other cau&s;e than a con|trary
action in the organic particles received from
the male. But this an&s;wer is too general to be
void of ob&s;curity. However, when we attend
to all the phaenomena, it may, perhaps, admit
of &s;ome illu&s;tration. The mixture of the two
&s;eminal fluids produces not only a male or fe|male
foetus, but other organized bodies, which
are endowed with the faculty of growth or ex|pan&s;ion.
The placenta, the membranes, &amp;c.
are produced at the &s;ame time, if not &s;ooner,
than the foetus. There are, therefore, in the
&s;eminal fluid of the male or female, or in the
mixture of both, organic particles not only &s;uit|ed
to the production of the foetus, but of the
<PB N="280" REF="293">
placenta and membranes. Since there are no
parts either in the male or female bodies from
which they could be detached, whence do the&s;e
particles proceed? It mu&s;t be admitted, that the
organic &s;eminal particles of each &s;ex being
equally active, uniformly produce organized
bodies every time that they can &s;ix them&s;elves,
by their mutual action upon one another; that,
of the particles de&s;tined to produce a male, tho&s;e
peculiar to the male &s;ex will fix fir&s;t, and form
the &s;exual parts; that the particles common to
both &s;exes may afterwards fix them&s;elves indif|ferently,
in order to form the re&s;t of the body;
and that the placenta and membranes are pro|duced
by the exce&s;s of organic particles which
have not been employed in the formation of the
foetus. If, as we have &s;uppo&s;ed, the foetus be
a male, all the organic particles peculiar to the
female &s;ex, which have not been employed, as
al&s;o the &s;uperfluous particles of both individuals
which have not entered into the compo&s;ition of
the foetus, and which cannot be le&s;s than one half
of the whole, remain for the formation of the
membranes and placenta. If the foetus be a
female, the &s;ame quantity of &s;uperfluous organic
particles &s;till remain, and are occupied in forming
the placenta and membranes.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that the membranes and
placenta, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, ought to become
another foetus, which would be a male, if the
fir&s;t was a female, and a female, if the fir&s;t was
<PB N="281" REF="294">
a male; becau&s;e the fir&s;t foetus con&s;umed only
the organic particles peculiar to the &s;ex of one
individual, and the half of tho&s;e particles which
were common to both &s;exes; and, of cour&s;e,
the &s;exual particles of the other individual, and
the other half of the common particles, remain
&s;till unexhau&s;ted. To this I reply, that the fir&s;t
union of the organic particles prevents a &s;econd,
at lea&s;t under the &s;ame form; and that the foe|tus,
being fir&s;t formed, exerts an external force
which de&s;troys the natural arrangement of the
other organic particles, and throws them into
that order which is nece&s;&s;ary for the formation
of the placenta and membranes.</P>
<P>From the experiments and ob&s;ervations for|merly
made, it is apparent, that all animated be|ings
contain an amazing quantity of living or|ganic
particles. The life of an animal or vege|table
&s;eems to be nothing el&s;e than a re&s;ult of
all the particular <HI>lives</HI> (if the expre&s;&s;ion be ad|mi&s;&s;ible)
of each of the&s;e active particles, who&s;e
life is primitive, and perhaps indi&s;tructible.
The&s;e living particles we have found in every
animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tance; and we are
certain, that all the&s;e particles are equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to the nutrition, and, con&s;equently, to the
reproduction of animals and vegetables. That
the union of a certain number of the&s;e particles,
therefore, &s;hould produce an animated being,
it is not difficult to conceive. As each particle
is animated, a whole, or any a&s;&s;emblage of them,
<PB N="282" REF="295">
mu&s;t be endowed with life. The&s;e living or|ganic
particles being common to all animated
beings, they are capable of forming particular
&s;pecies of animals, or of vegetables, according
to the peculiar arrangement they a&s;&s;ume. Now,
this arrangement depends entirely on the form
of the individuals which furni&s;h the organic
particles. If they are furni&s;hed by an animal,
they arrange them&s;elves under the form pecu|liar
to its &s;pecies, exactly agreeable to that ar|rangement
they ob&s;erved when they nouri&s;hed
or expanded the animal it&s;elf. But, does not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity
of &s;ome ba&s;e or centre, round which the particles
a&s;&s;emble in order to unite and form a foetus?
This ba&s;is is furni&s;hed by the particles which
form the &s;exual parts. I &s;hall illu&s;trate this point.</P>
<P>As long as the organic particles of either &s;ex
remain alone, their activity produces no effect,
becau&s;e it is not oppo&s;ed by any re&s;i&s;tance or re|action
from particles of a different kind. But,
when the male and female liquors are blended,
the particles detached from the &s;exual parts be|ing
of a different kind, &s;erve as a ba&s;e to fix the
activity of the other particles.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that the organic par|ticles
which, in the mixture of the two fluids,
repre&s;ent the &s;exual parts of the male, can alone
&s;erve as a ba&s;is to the particles which proceed from
all parts of the female; and that tho&s;e proceed|ing
from all parts of the male can only be fixed
<PB N="283" REF="296">
by the particles which are detached from the
&s;exual parts of the female; we may con|clude,
that the &s;exual parts of the male foe|tus
are formed by the organic particles of the
father, and the re&s;t of its body by the organic
particles of the female; and, on the contrary,
that the female foetus derives nothing but its
&s;ex from the mother, and the re&s;t of its body
from the father. Boys, therefore, excepting in
the parts which di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;ex, ought to
re&s;emble the mother more than the father, and
girls &s;hould re&s;emble the father more than the
mother.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering generation by &s;exes under this
light, we &s;hould conclude it to be the mo&s;t com|mon
manner of reproduction, as it is in reality.
Beings of the mo&s;t perfect organization, as ani|mals,
who&s;e bodies make a whole that is inca|pable
of divi&s;ion, and who&s;e powers are all con|centrated
into one point, cannot be reproduced
in any other way; becau&s;e they contain only
particles that are perfectly &s;imilar, and cannot
be united but by means of different particles
furni&s;hed by another individual. But vegetables,
which are le&s;s perfect in their organization, and
which can be divided without de&s;truction, are
capable of being reproduced in different ways:
1. Becau&s;e they contain di&s;&s;imilar particles;
2. Becau&s;e the form of the&s;e bodies is le&s;s fixed
and determined than that of an animal, diffe|rent
parts may &s;upply the functions of each o|ther,
<PB N="284" REF="297">
and vary according to circum&s;tances: The
roots of a tree, when expo&s;ed to the air, pu&s;h out
branches and leaves; and thus the organic par|ticles
of vegetables obtain a local e&s;tabli&s;hment,
become fixed, and produce individuals in many
different ways.</P>
<P>The &s;ame phaenomenon is exhibited in ani|mals
who&s;e organization is le&s;s perfect, as in the
fre&s;h water polypus, and others, that are capable
of reproducing by the divi&s;ion of their parts.
The&s;e organized bodies, in&s;tead of &s;ingle ani|mals,
may be con&s;idered as bundles of organized
beings united by a common membrane, as trees
are compo&s;ed of an infinite number of minute
trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE>. The vine-fretters, which propagate indi|vidually,
likewi&s;e contain di&s;&s;imilar particles;
becau&s;e, after producing their young, they
change into barren flies. Snails mutually com|municate
di&s;&s;imilar particles to each other; and,
therefore, each individual is fruitful. Thus, in
every mode of generation with which we are
acquainted, we find, that the nece&s;&s;ary union of
the organic particles cannot be effected but by
the admixture of different particles, to &s;erve as
a common ba&s;is, and to fix or de&s;troy their ac|tivity.</P>
<P>According to this general idea of &s;exes, we
may &s;uppo&s;e, that the di&s;tinction of &s;ex extends
through all Nature; for <HI>&s;ex,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, is no|thing
but that part of bodies which furni&s;hes
<PB N="285" REF="298">
organic particles of a different kind from tho&s;e
of the common parts, and which &s;erve as a ba&s;is
for their union. But it is, perhaps, u&s;ele&s;s to
rea&s;on on a que&s;tion which can be &s;olved at once,
by &s;aying, that, as God has created &s;exes, ani|mals
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be produced by their in|tervention.
We are not in a condition, as I
formerly remarked, to explain <HI>why</HI> things exi&s;t;
we are unable to explain <HI>why</HI> Nature almo&s;t
univer&s;ally employs &s;exes for the reproduction
of animals, or <HI>why</HI> &s;exes exi&s;t. We ought,
therefore, to content our&s;elves with rea&s;oning
concerning things as they are. If we attempt
to ri&s;e higher, we lo&s;e our&s;elves in the regions
of fancy, and forget the narrow limits of our
knowledge.</P>
<P>Leaving, therefore, all farther &s;ubtleties, I
&s;hall adhere to nothing that is not founded on
facts and ob&s;ervation. I find that the repro|duction
of bodies is effected in many different
modes: But, at the &s;ame time, I clearly perceive,
that animals and vegetables are reproduced by
the union of the organic particles detached from
all parts of their bodies. I am certain that the&s;e
active organic particles exi&s;t in the &s;eeds of ve|getables,
and in the &s;eminal fluids of animals,
both male and female; and have no doubt that
every &s;pecies of reproduction is accompli&s;hed
by the union and admixture of the&s;e particles.
It is equally unque&s;tionable, that, in the gene|ration
of man, and other animals, the organic
<PB N="286" REF="299">
particles of the male and female mix at the time
of conception; becau&s;e we often &s;ee children
who re&s;emble both father and mother: And,
what confirms this theory is, that all the particles
common to the two &s;exes mix together promi&s;|cuou&s;ly,
but that the particles peculiar to the
&s;exes never mix; for we daily perceive children
with eyes re&s;embling tho&s;e of the father, while
their mouth and front re&s;emble tho&s;e of the
mother. But we never &s;ee any &s;uch mixture of
re&s;emblances in the &s;exual parts; we never find,
in the &s;ame individual, the te&s;ticles of the father
and the vagina of the mother.</P>
<P>The formation of the foetus, therefore, is ef|fected
by the mixture of the organic particles of
both &s;exes; and this mixture fixes or gives a lo|cal
e&s;tabli&s;hment to the particles, becau&s;e it is
made according to the laws of affinity which
take place between the different parts, and which
determine the particles to arrange them&s;elves in
the &s;ame order they ob&s;erved when they exi&s;ted
in the individuals who furni&s;hed them. The
particles which proceed from the head, for ex|ample,
cannot, according to the&s;e laws, take up
their &s;tation in the legs, or in any other part
but the head of the foetus. All the particles are
in motion when they fir&s;t unite; and this mo|tion
mu&s;t be round the point or centre of union.
This ba&s;is or central point, which is nece&s;&s;ary
to the union of the particles, and which, by its
reaction and inertia, fixes and de&s;troys their ac|tivity,
<PB N="287" REF="300">
is probably the fir&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of parti|cles
that proceed from the &s;exual parts, becau&s;e
they are the only particles in the mixture that
differ from tho&s;e common to both &s;exes.</P>
<P>I imagine, therefore, that, in the mixture of
the two fluids, the organic particles which come
from the &s;exual parts of the male fix them&s;elves
fir&s;t, and cannot unite with tho&s;e which pro|ceed
from the &s;eminal parts of the female, be|cau&s;e
they are of a different nature, and have
le&s;s affinity to each other than the particles that
come from the eye, the arm, or any other part
of the female. Round this centre, or point of
union, the other organic particles &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ar|range
them&s;elves in the &s;ame order they former|ly
exi&s;ted in the body from which they were de|rived;
and, according as the particles of the one
or of the other individual mo&s;t abound, or near|er
this central point, they enter in greater or
le&s;s quantities into the compo&s;ition of the new
being, which, in this manner, is formed in the
middle of a homogeneous fluid; at the &s;ame
time, ve&s;&s;els begin to &s;hoot, which increa&s;e in
proportion to the growth of the foetus, and fur|ni&s;h
it with proper nouri&s;hment. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els,
which have a peculiar &s;pecies of organization,
are probably formed by the exce&s;s of the orga|nic
particles which have not been admitted into the
compo&s;ition of the foetus; for, as the&s;e particles
are both active, and furni&s;hed with a ba&s;e or
point of union from the organic particles pecu|liar
<PB N="288" REF="301">
to the &s;exual parts of the other individual,
they mu&s;t arrange them&s;elves in the form of an
organized body, but not in the form of another
foetus; becau&s;e their po&s;ition with re&s;pect to
each other has been changed by the different
movements of the particles which entered into the
compo&s;ition of the fir&s;t foetus. From the union
of the&s;e &s;uperabundant particles, therefore, an
irregular body mu&s;t ari&s;e, which will re&s;emble
the foetus in nothing but its growth and expan|&s;ion;
becau&s;e, though this body be compo&s;ed of
the &s;ame organic active particles with the foetus,
their po&s;ition and form mu&s;t be different, as they
were thrown a&s;ide from the centre or point of
union, which &s;erved as a ba&s;is for the formation
of the foetus.</P>
<P>When the quantity of &s;eminal fluid of both
individuals is great, or, rather, when the&s;e liquors
abound with organic particles, different centres
of attraction are formed in different parts of the
mixture; and, in that ca&s;e, by a mechani&s;m &s;i|milar
to what has been mentioned above, &s;everal
foetu&s;es are formed, &s;ome of them males, and
others females, according as the particles of the
one &s;ex or of the other are mo&s;t active. But,
from the &s;ame centre of attraction, two foetu&s;es
can never originate; becau&s;e two centres are re|qui&s;ite
for this purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides, if this were to
happen, no particles would be left for the for|mation
of the placenta and membranes; becau&s;e
they would all be employed in con&s;tituting the
<PB N="289" REF="302">
&s;econd foetus, which would nece&s;&s;arily be a fe|male,
if the other was a male. All that could
happen in &s;uch a ca&s;e would be, that &s;ome of
the particles common to both individuals, being
equally attracted by the fir&s;t centre of union,
mu&s;t arrive there at the &s;ame time, and produce
a mon&s;ter, or a foetus with &s;uperfluous parts;
or, if &s;ome of the common particles &s;hould fix
at too great a di&s;tance from the fir&s;t centre, or be
con&s;trained by the attraction of the &s;econd, round
which the placenta is formed, a mon&s;ter, defec|tive
in &s;ome part, would be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>That the organic particles peculiar to the &s;ex|ual
parts &s;erve for a ba&s;is or centre of union to
the other particles of which the embryo is form|ed,
I pretend not to demon&s;trate: But, as they
are the only particles which differ from the re&s;t,
it is more natural to imagine that they &s;hould
an&s;wer this purpo&s;e than tho&s;e which are com|mon
to both individuals.</P>
<P>I formerly detected the errors of tho&s;e who
maintained, that the heart, or the blood, were fir&s;t
formed. The whole is formed at the &s;ame time.
We learn from actual ob&s;ervation, that the
chicken exi&s;ts in the egg before it is &s;it upon.
The head, the back-bone, and even the appen|dages
which form the placenta, are all di&s;tingui&s;h|able.
I have opened a great number of eggs,
both before and after incubation, and I am con|vinced,
from the evidence of my own eyes, that
the whole chicken exi&s;ts, in the middle of the
<PB N="290" REF="303">
cicatrice, the moment the egg i&s;&s;ues from the bo|dy
of the hen. The heat communicated to it by
incubation, only expands the parts, by putting
the fluids in motion. But we have never been
able to determine, with certainty, what parts of
the foetus are fir&s;t fixed, at the moment of its
formation.</P>
<P>I have always maintained, that the organic
particles were fixed, and that they united in con|&s;equence
of their motion being &s;u&s;pended. Of
the truth of this fact I am fully convinced; for,
if the male and female &s;emen be &s;eparately exa|mined,
we find in both a great number of mo|ving
particles; but, when the&s;e fluids are mix|ed,
the motion of the particles is totally de&s;troy|ed,
and a certain degree of heat is nece&s;&s;ary to
renew their activity; for the chicken, which ex|i&s;ts
in the centre of the cicatrice, has no motion
before incubation; and, even 24 hours, or two
days afterwards, when we begin to perceive it
without the micro&s;cope, it has not the &s;malle&s;t
appearance of motion. During the fir&s;t two or
three days, the foetus is only a &s;mall white mu|cilaginous
ma&s;s, which gradually acquires con|&s;i&s;tence
and magnitude. But this progre&s;s is ex|ceedingly
&s;low, and has no re&s;emblance to the
rapid movements of the organic particles in the
&s;eminal fluid. Be&s;ides, it was not without rea|&s;on
that I maintained that the motion of the or|ganic
particles was entirely de&s;troyed; for, if
eggs be kept without expo&s;ing them to the de|gree
<PB N="291" REF="304">
of heat that is nece&s;&s;ary for the expan|&s;ion
of the chicken, the embryo, though com|pleatly
formed, will remain without any motion,
and the organic particles of which it is compo|&s;ed
will continue fixed, without being able to
give life and motion to the embryo which was
formed by their union. Thus, after the motion
of the organic particles is &s;topped, and after they
have united in &s;uch a manner as to form a foe|tus,
&s;ome external cau&s;e is &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to give
them life and motion. This cau&s;e, or agent, is
heat, which, by rarifying the fluids, obliges them
to circulate: This circulation makes all the or|gans
act; and nothing farther is nece&s;&s;ary for
the growth and expan&s;ion of the parts than the
continuation of this heat.</P>
<P>Before the action of this external heat, there
is not the &s;malle&s;t appearance of blood; and I
never could perceive any change of colour in
the ve&s;&s;els till about 24 hours after incubation.
In the ve&s;&s;els of the placenta, which communi|cate
with the body of the foetus, the blood fir&s;t
appears. But, it would &s;eem that this blood lo|&s;es
its red colour, as it approaches the body of
the animal; for the chicken is entirely white;
and, during the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third days af|ter
incubation, we can with difficulty perceive
a few red particles near the animal's body, but
which &s;eem not to make any part of it, though
the&s;e red particles are de&s;tined for the formation
of the heart. Thus the formation of blood is
an effect produced by the motion communicated
<PB N="292" REF="305">
to the fluids by heat; and even this blood is
formed without the body of the animal, the
whole &s;ub&s;tance of which con&s;i&s;ts of a white
mucilage.</P>
<P>The foetus, as well as the placenta, receive the
nouri&s;hment that is nece&s;&s;ary for their expan&s;ion
by a &s;pecies of ab&s;orption; and they a&s;&s;imilate
the organic particles of the liquor in which they
&s;wim: For, it is an equal impropriety to &s;ay that
the placenta nouri&s;hes the animal, as that the a|nimal
nouri&s;hes the placenta. If the placenta
nouri&s;hed the foetus, the former would dimini&s;h
in proportion to the growth of the latter, which
by no means happens; for both augment toge|ther.
I have indeed ob&s;erved, that, in eggs, the
placenta at fir&s;t grows much more in proportion
than the foetus, and, con&s;equently, it may nou|ri&s;h
the animal; or, rather, it conveys nouri&s;h|ment
to it by means of ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>What we have &s;aid concerning the chicken,
admits of an ea&s;y application to the human foe|tus,
which is formed by the union of the orga|nic
particles of the two &s;exes. The membranes
and placenta are produced by the &s;uperabundant
particles that enter not into the compo&s;ition of
the foetus, which is now inclo&s;ed in a double
membrane, containing al&s;o a quantity of fluid.
This fluid is at fir&s;t, perhaps, nothing but a por|tion
of the &s;eminal liquors of the father and mo|ther;
and, as the foetus is not thrown out of the
uterus, it enjoys, from the moment of its forma|tion,
<PB N="293" REF="306">
as much external heat as is &s;ufficient for its
expan&s;ion. This heat communicates motion to
the fluids; it gives play to all the organs; and
the blood is formed in the placenta, and in the
body of the foetus, &s;olely by the motion excited
by the heat. We might even maintain, that the
formation of the blood in a child is as indepen|dent
of the mother, as that which ari&s;es in the
egg is independent of the hen that covers it, or
of the furnace which heats it.</P>
<P>It is certain that the foetus, the membranes,
and the placenta, are all nouri&s;hed and expanded
by ab&s;orption; for, at fir&s;t, the &s;ack that con|tains
the whole product of generation does not
adhere to the uterus: And we have &s;een, from
the experiments of De Graaf upon female rab|bits,
that he made the globules which contained
the foetu&s;es roll about in the uterus. They
could receive no nouri&s;hment, therefore, but by
ab&s;orbing the fluids that con&s;tantly bedew the
uterus, to which they afterwards begin to ad|here
by means of a mucilage that gradually gives
origin to &s;mall blood-ve&s;&s;els, as &s;hall afterwards
be more fully explained.</P>
<P>But to return to the formation of the foetus,
concerning which we have to make &s;everal re|marks,
both as to its &s;ituation, and to the differ|ent
circum&s;tances that may prevent or alter the
mode of its production.</P>
<P>In the human &s;pecies, the &s;emen of the male
enters into the uterus, the cavity of which is
<PB N="294" REF="307">
con&s;iderable; and, when it meets with a &s;uffi|cient
quantity of female &s;emen, the two in&s;tantly
mix, and the organic particles unite and form
the foetus. The whole is, perhaps, performed
in a moment, e&s;pecially if the two fluids be in
an active &s;tate. The cavity of the uterus is the
proper place for the formation of the foetus;
becau&s;e the &s;emen of the male has an ea&s;ier ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the uterus than into the Fallopian
tubes or ovarium; and, as the uterus has only
a &s;mall aperture, which is always &s;hut, excepting
when opened by the ardor of love, the materi|als
of generation remain there in &s;afety, unle&s;s
they be di&s;turbed by &s;ome rare and accidental
circum&s;tance. But, as the male fluid moi&s;tens
the vagina, before it penetrates the uterus, and,
as the organic particles are exceedingly active,
it may penetrate as far as the Fallopian tubes
and ovarium. In the &s;ame manner, as the fe|male
fluid is already perfected in the glandular
bodies of the te&s;ticles, from which it di&s;tills and
moi&s;tens the Fallopian tubes, before it de&s;cends
into the uterus; and, as it may e&s;cape through
the lacunae round the neck of the uterus, it is
not impo&s;&s;ible that the mixture of the two li|quors
may take place in all the&s;e different pla|ces.
Foetu&s;es, therefore, may frequently be
formed in the vagina, and in&s;tantly fall out of
it, having nothing proper for their retention.
They may al&s;o be &s;ometimes formed in the Fal|lopian
<PB N="295" REF="308">
tubes; but in&s;tances of this kind mu&s;t be
rare.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts mention, that foetu&s;es have been
found, not only in the Fallopian tubes, but like|wi&s;e
in the ovaria. M. Theroude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See mem. de I'acad. des &s;ciences, tom. 2. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, a &s;urgeon
in Paris, &s;howed to the academy a rude ma&s;s
which he found in the right ovarium of a girl of
18 years of age. Two open fi&s;&s;ures, garni&s;hed
with hair like the eye-lids, were perceived in it.
Above the&s;e eye-lids was a kind of front, with
a black line in place of eye-brows. Immediate|ly
above the front, there were &s;everal hairs col|lected
into two &s;eparate pencils, one of them a|bout
&s;even inches long, and the other three. Below
the angle of the eye, two large, hard, white
dentes molares appeared, together with their
gums: The&s;e teeth were about three lines long,
and about a line di&s;tant from each other. Se|veral
other teeth appeared, &s;ituated at different
di&s;tances. In the &s;ame volume<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 244.</NOTE>, M. Mery is
reported to have found in the ovarium of a wo|man
an upper jaw-bone, with &s;everal teeth in
it, &s;o perfect that they appeared to be at lea&s;t
of ten years growth. In the Medical Jour|nal,
publi&s;hed by the Abb&eacute; de la Roque<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">January 1683.</NOTE>, we
have the hi&s;tory of a woman, who died of her
ninth child, which had been formed <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI>
one of the ovaria; for, from the de&s;cription, it
is not clear whether the child was within the o|varium,
<PB N="296" REF="309">
or only adjacent to it. This foetus was
about an inch thick, and compleatly formed. In
the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, examples are re|corded
of teeth, hair, and bones being found in
the ovaria of women. If all the&s;e facts can be
credited, the &s;eminal liquor of the male mu&s;t be
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes, though rarely, to mount up
to the ovaria. But there are many con&s;iderations
which render this point extremely doubtful:
1. The facts which &s;eem to &s;upport it are few:
2. The only in&s;tance of a perfect foetus found
in the ovarium, is narrated in a very &s;u&s;picious
manner by M. Littre. Neither is it impo&s;&s;ible
that the &s;eminal fluid of the female alone may
&s;ometimes produce organized ma&s;&s;es, as moles,
ci&s;ts full of hair, of bones, or of fle&s;h. Be&s;ides,
if we are to believe anatomi&s;ts, foetu&s;es may be
formed in the te&s;ticles of men as well as in tho&s;e
of women; for, we are told by a &s;urgeon, in the
2d volume of the hi&s;tory of the old academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 298.</NOTE>,
that he found a foetus, with its membranes, in
which the head, the feet, the eyes, the bones and
cartilages, were di&s;tingui&s;hable in the &s;crotum of
a man. Were all the&s;e facts equally worthy of
credit, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily adopt one of the two
following hypothe&s;es; either that the &s;eminal
fluid of each &s;ex can produce nothing without
being mixed with the other; or, that either of
the fluids alone is capable of producing irregu|larly
organized ma&s;&s;es. If we maintain the for|mer
<PB N="297" REF="310">
hypothe&s;is, to explain the facts above rela|ted,
we &s;hall be obliged to admit, that the male
fluid &s;ometimes a&s;cends to the ovarium, and, by
mixing there with the female fluid, forms or|ganized
bodies; and al&s;o, that the female fluid,
by being copiou&s;ly effu&s;ed in the vagina, may,
in the time of coition, penetrate as far as the
&s;crotum of the male, in the &s;ame manner as the
venereal virus often reaches that part; and, con|&s;equently,
that an organized body may be form|ed
in the &s;crotum by a mixture of the male and
female fluids. If the other hypothe&s;is, which is
the mo&s;t probable, be adopted, namely, that the
&s;eminal fluid of each individual may &s;eparately
produce organized ma&s;&s;es, then all the&s;e o&s;&s;eous,
fle&s;hy, and hairy bodies, which &s;ometimes appear
in the ovaria of females, and in the &s;crotum of
males, may derive their origin from the &s;eminal
fluid of the individual in which they are found.
But it is needle&s;s to &s;peculate farther concerning
facts which &s;eem to be more uncertain than in|explicable;
for I am inclined to think, that the
&s;eminal fluid of each individual may &s;ingly pro|duce
&s;omething; and that young girls, for ex|ample,
may produce moles, without any inter|cour&s;e
with the male, in the &s;ame manner as
hens lay eggs without the intervention of the
cock. I might &s;upport this opinion with ob&s;er|vations
equally credible as tho&s;e we have ju&s;t
now quoted. M. de la Saone, a phy&s;ician and
anatomi&s;t, publi&s;hed a treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, in
<PB N="298" REF="311">
which he a&s;&s;ures us, that nuns, though &s;trictly
cloi&s;tered, &s;ometimes produce moles: And why
&s;hould this be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince hens produce eggs
without any communication with the cock, and
&s;ince we find, in the cicatrices of the&s;e eggs, in|&s;tead
of a chicken, a mole with its appendages?
The analogy here is &s;ufficiently &s;trong to make
us at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend a ra&s;h determination. What|ever
be in this, it is certain, that a mixture of
the two fluids is nece&s;&s;ary for the formation of
a foetus, and that this mixture cannot be pro|perly
effected but in the uterus, or in the Fallo|pian
tubes, where anatomi&s;ts have &s;ometimes di&s;|covered
foetu&s;es: And it is natural to imagine,
that tho&s;e which have been found in the cavity
of the abdomen, have e&s;caped by the extremity
of the tube, or by &s;ome accidental rupture of the
uterus; and that they never fall into the abdo|men
from the ovarium, becau&s;e I think it next
to impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;eminal fluid &s;hould a&s;cend
&s;o far. Leeuwenhoek has computed the motion
of his pretended &s;permatic animals to be four
or five inches in 40 minutes; &s;o that, if the
whole fluid moved at this rate, in an hour or
two the animalcules might proceed from the va|gina
into the uterus, from the uterus into the
Fallopian tubes, and from the Fallopian tubes
into the ovaria. But, how is it po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive,
that the organic particles, who&s;e motion
cea&s;es whenever they are deprived of the fluid
part of the &s;emen, &s;hould arrive at the ovarium,
<PB N="299" REF="312">
unle&s;s they were accompanied with the liquor
in which they &s;wim? The moving particles
cannot give a progre&s;&s;ive motion to the fluid
which contains them. Thus, whatever activity
may be a&s;cribed to the&s;e organic particles, we
cannot conceive how they &s;hould arrive at the
ovarium, and there form a foetus, unle&s;s, by
&s;ome unknown power, the fluid is ab&s;orbed by
the ovarium, a &s;uppo&s;ition which is not only gra|tuitous,
but contrary to probability.</P>
<P>The difficulty attending this &s;uppo&s;ition con|firms
the opinion, that the male fluid enters the
uterus, either by its orifice, or by penetrating its
&s;ub&s;tance. The female fluid may likewi&s;e find
its way into the uterus, either by the aperture at
the extremity of the Fallopian tubes, or by pe|netrating
the &s;ub&s;tance of the tubes and uterus.
M. Weitbrech, an able anatomi&s;t of the acade|my
of Peter&s;burg, has clearly proved that the &s;e|minal
fluid can penetrate through the &s;ub&s;tance
of the uterus: 'Res omni attentione digni&s;&s;ima,'

The change which the male fluid produ|ces

&s;ufficient to demon&s;trate the truth of the fact.

by entering the apertures at the extremities of
the Fallopian tubes, as the male fluid enters by
the orifice of the uterus it&s;elf; and, con&s;equent|ly,
that the foetus may be formed in the cavity
of the uterus, by the mixture of the two fluids,

<HEAD>Of the Expan&s;ion, Growth, and Delivery of the
Foetus, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the expan&s;ion of the foetus, two different
&s;pecies of growth are di&s;tingui&s;hable: The
fir&s;t, which immediately &s;ucceeds the formation
of the foetus, is not uniform in all the parts of
the animal. The nearer the foetus approaches
to maturity, the growth of the parts is more
proportional; and it is not till after the birth,
that all the parts grow nearly in an equable
manner. We mu&s;t not imagine, that the foe|tus,
at the time of its formation, has the exact
figure of an adult. The &s;mall embryo, it is
true, contains all the parts e&s;&s;ential to a man;
but they differ in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>In an organized body, like that of an animal,
&s;ome parts may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more e&s;&s;ential
than others; and though none of them are u&s;e|le&s;s
or &s;uperfluous, yet there are &s;ome to which
others &s;eem to owe their growth and di&s;po&s;ition.
Some parts may be con&s;idered as fundamental,
without which the animal could not exi&s;t, and
others as only &s;uperficial and acce&s;&s;ory. The
<PB N="304" REF="317">
latter &s;eem to derive their origin from the for|mer,
and to be intended more for conferring
&s;ymmetry and external ornament on the animal,
than for enabling it to exi&s;t, or to perform the
functions e&s;&s;ential to life. The&s;e two different
&s;pecies of parts are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively expanded, and
are almo&s;t equally apparent at the time of birth.
But there are other parts, as the teeth, which
arrive not at full maturity till &s;everal years af|ter;
and others, as the glandular bodies in the
female te&s;ticles, the beard of males, &amp;c. which
appear not till the age of puberty.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover the fundamental and e&s;&s;ential
parts of an animal body, attention mu&s;t be had
to the number, &s;ituation, and nature of the
whole. Tho&s;e which are &s;imple, tho&s;e who&s;e
po&s;ition is invariable, and tho&s;e without which
the animal cannot exi&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, which
are double, or more numerous, tho&s;e which
vary in &s;ize and po&s;ition, and tho&s;e which may
be taken away without injuring or killing the
creature, may be regarded as le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, or
more acce&s;&s;ory to the animal machine. Ari&s;totle
mentions, that the only parts e&s;&s;ential to all ani|mals
are tho&s;e with which they take and dige&s;t
their nouri&s;hment, and throw out the &s;uperflu|ous
part of it from the body. The whole in|te&s;tinal
canal is indeed extremely &s;imple, and
no other part can &s;upply its place. The head
and back-bone are likewi&s;e &s;imple parts, the po|&s;ition
<PB N="305" REF="318">
of which is invariable. The back-bone
is the foundation of the animal frame; and the
action and movements of mo&s;t members of the
body depend upon the &s;pinal marrow which that
bone contains. It is this part, al&s;o, together with the
head, which appears fir&s;t in the embryo. Now,
the&s;e &s;imple parts, which are fir&s;t formed, are
all e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence and the form of the
animal.</P>
<P>The double parts in an animal body are more
numerous than the &s;ingle parts; and they &s;eem
to be produced on each &s;ide of the &s;ingle parts by
a &s;pecies of vegetation; for the double parts are
&s;imilar in form, and different only in po&s;ition.
The left hand is perfectly &s;imilar to the right;
but, if the left hand was placed in the &s;ituation
of the right, we could not perform the &s;ame ac|tions
with it. The &s;ame thing may be ob&s;erved
of all the double parts: They are &s;imilar in
form, but differ in po&s;ition, which is relative to
the body of the particular animal; and, if a line
were drawn, dividing the body into two equal
parts, the po&s;ition of all the &s;imilar parts would
tend to this line as to a centre.</P>
<P>The &s;pinal marrow, and the vertebrae in
which it is inclo&s;ed, appear to be the real axis
of all the double parts of the animal body, from
which they &s;eem to derive their origin, and to
be only proportional branches i&s;&s;uing from this
trunk or common ba&s;e; for, in the young chick,
we &s;ee the ribs &s;hooting from each &s;ide of the
<PB N="306" REF="319">
vertebrae, as the &s;mall branches &s;hoot out from
the principal branch of a tree. In all embryos,
the middle of the head and the vertebrae fir&s;t
appear; we then &s;ee, on each &s;ide of the ve&s;icle
which compo&s;es the middle of the head, two o|ther
ve&s;icles which &s;eem to proceed from the
fir&s;t: The&s;e two ve&s;icles contain the eyes, and
the other double parts of the head. In the &s;ame
manner, we perceive an equal number of &s;mall
tubercles i&s;&s;uing from each &s;ide of the vertebrae,
which gradually extend, and form the ribs, and
other double parts of the trunk. La&s;tly, the
arms and legs appear like &s;mall tubercles on
each &s;ide of the trunk. This fir&s;t growth is
very different from what afterwards takes place:
It is the production of parts which appear for
the fir&s;t time; the growth which &s;ucceeds is on|ly
an expan&s;ion of parts already formed.</P>
<P>The order and &s;ymmetry of the double parts
in all animals, their regular po&s;ition, the equa|lity
of their exten&s;ion and growth, and the per|fect
&s;imilarity of their &s;tructure, &s;eem to indi|cate,
that they derive their origin from the &s;in|gle
parts; that a certain force re&s;ides in the &s;in|gle
parts that acts equally on each &s;ide; or, which
amounts to the &s;ame, they are the ba&s;es or fulcra
again&s;t which the action of tho&s;e powers that
produce the expan&s;ion of the double parts is
exerted; and that the action of the&s;e forces,
both on the right and left &s;ides, are preci&s;ely
equal, and counterbalance each other.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="320">
Hence we may conclude, that, if there is any
defect, or redundance, in the matter de&s;tined for
the formation of the double parts, as the forces
are equal on each &s;ide, this defect or exce&s;s
mu&s;t take place both in the right and left &s;ides.
If, for example, from a defect of matter, a man
has but two fingers in the right hand, in place
of five, the &s;ame defect will appear in the left;
if, from an exce&s;s of matter, there be &s;ix
fingers in the right hand, he will have the &s;ame
number in the left; or, if the matter be vitiated,
and produces a change in the parts of one &s;ide,
the &s;ame change will appear in the other. Of
this fact we have daily proofs: The parts of
mon&s;ters are always deranged in a certain order
and proportion. Hence Nature, even in her er|rors,
uniformly commits the lea&s;t of po&s;&s;ible
mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>This harmony in the po&s;ition of the double
parts of animals, is likewi&s;e apparent in vege|tables.
The branches pu&s;h out &s;maller ramifi|cations
on each &s;ide; the &s;mall nerves in the
leaves are equally di&s;po&s;ed with regard to the
principal nerve; and, if the &s;ymmetry appears
to be le&s;s exact in vegetables than in animals,
this proceeds only from its being more various,
and becau&s;e its limits are more exten&s;ive, and
le&s;s preci&s;e. But the &s;ame order is ea&s;ily recog|ni&s;able;
and the &s;ingle and e&s;&s;ential parts are
perfectly di&s;tinct from tho&s;e which are double;
<PB N="308" REF="321">
and it is evident, that the latter derive their ori|gin
from the former.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to determine the form of the&s;e
double parts before their expan&s;ion, or in what
manner they are complicated, or what figure
re&s;ults from their po&s;ition in relation to the
&s;ingle parts. The body of an animal, at the
in&s;tant of its formation, unque&s;tionably con|tains
all the parts of which it ought to be com|po&s;ed:
But the relative di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e
parts is then very different from what after|wards
appears. If we examine the expan&s;ion
of a young leaf of a tree, we will find that it is
plaited on each &s;ide of the principal nerve; and
that its figure, at this time, has no re&s;emblance
to that which it afterwards a&s;&s;umes. When we
amu&s;e our&s;elves with plaiting paper, in order to
give it the form of a crown, of a boat, &amp;c. the
different plaits of the paper &s;eem to have no re|&s;emblance
to the figure which re&s;ults from their
expan&s;ion: We only perceive that the plaits
are uniformly made in a certain order and pro|portion,
and that, whatever is done on one &s;ide,
is al&s;o done on the other. But, to determine
the figures which may re&s;ult from the expan|&s;ion
of any given number of folds, is a problem
beyond the powers of geometry. The &s;cience
of mathematics reaches not what immediately
depends upon po&s;ition. Leibnitz's art of <HI>Ana|ly&s;is
&s;itus</HI> does not yet exi&s;t; though the art of
knowing the relations that re&s;ult from the po&s;i|tion
<PB N="309" REF="322">
of things would be, perhaps, more u&s;eful
than that which has only magnitude for its ob|ject;
for we have more occa&s;ion to be acquaint|ed
with form than with matter.</P>
<P>In the expan&s;ion of natural productions, the
folded or plaited parts not only a&s;&s;ume different
po&s;itions, but they acquire, at the &s;ame time, ex|ten&s;ion
and &s;olidity. Since, therefore, we are
unable to a&s;certain the exact re&s;ult of a &s;imple
expan&s;ion of a folded figure, in which, as in
folded paper, nothing takes place but a change
of po&s;ition among the parts, without any aug|mentation
or diminution of the quantity of
matter, how is it po&s;&s;ible for us to judge con|cerning
the expan&s;ion of the compound body of
an animal, in which not only the relative po&s;i|tion,
but likewi&s;e the quantity of matter in the&s;e
parts, &s;uffer con&s;iderable changes? We can only
rea&s;on, therefore, on this &s;ubject, by drawing
conclu&s;ions from the examination of objects at
different periods of their expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>We, indeed, perceive the chick in the egg
before incubation: It &s;wims in a tran&s;parent
fluid, contained in a &s;mall pur&s;e formed by a
very fine membrane in the centre of the cica|trice.
But the chick is then only a particle of
inanimated matter, in which no organization or
determined figure can be di&s;tingui&s;hed. We can
perceive, however, that one of its extremities is
the head, and the other the back-bone. The
embryo, in this &s;tate, &s;eems to be the fir&s;t pro|duct
<PB N="310" REF="323">
of fecundation, re&s;ulting from the mixture
of the male and female &s;emen. To a&s;certain
this fact, &s;everal things require attention: When
the hen has, for &s;ome days, been along with the
cock, and afterwards &s;eparated from him, the
eggs produced 20 days or a month after this &s;e|paration,
are equally fertile as tho&s;e laid during
her cohabitation with the male. The eggs pro|duced
at the end of this period require only the
u&s;ual time of 21 days in hatching; and their
embryos are equally advanced both in form and
con&s;i&s;tence. From this circum&s;tance we might
be led to imagine, that the form in which the
embryo appears before incubation, is not the
immediate effect of the mixture of the two &s;e|minal
fluids, but that it exi&s;ted in different
forms during the abode of the egg in the body
of the mother; for the embryo, in the form in
which we &s;ee it before incubation, requires only
the aid of heat in order to bring it to maturity.
Now, if this form of the embryo had exi&s;ted
21 days or a month before, when the egg was
fir&s;t impregnated, why was it not hatched by
the internal heat of the mother? Why do we
not find the chick compleatly formed in tho&s;e
eggs which have been impregnated 21 days be|fore
they are laid?</P>
<P>But this difficulty, though &s;eemingly great, is
not in&s;urmountable. When the hen cohabits
with the cock, the cicatrice of each egg, which
contains the &s;emen of the female, receives a &s;mall
<PB N="311" REF="324">
quantity of the male fluid. The eggs in the o|varium
of oviparous females are analogous to the
glandular bodies in the te&s;ticles of the vivipa|rous:
The cicatrice of the egg corre&s;ponds to
the cavity of tho&s;e glandular bodies which con|tain
the female &s;emen; and that of the male pe|netrates
and mixes with it. The formation of
the embryo in&s;tantly re&s;ults from this mixture
or union of the two fluids. The fir&s;t egg laid
by the hen after her communication with the
cock, is fecundated and capable of being hatch|ed.
Tho&s;e which &s;he is afterwards to lay were
all impregnated at the &s;ame in&s;tant: But, as
they want &s;ome e&s;&s;ential parts, the production of
which has no dependence on the male fluid; as
they have neither the white, the membranes, nor
the &s;hell, the &s;mall embryos contained in the
cicatrices of the&s;e imperfect eggs, are inca|pable
of being hatched, though aided by the in|ternal
heat of the mother. The embryo, there|fore,
remains in the cicatrice, in the &s;ame &s;tate
in which it was fir&s;t formed, till the egg acquires
all the parts nece&s;&s;ary to the growth and nou|ri&s;hment
of the foetus; and it is not till after the
egg has arrived at full perfection, that the ex|pan&s;ion
of the embryo commences. This ex|pan&s;ion
is effected by the external heat of incu|bation:
But it is unque&s;tionable, that, if the egg
could be retained in the body 21 days after it
was completely formed, the chick would be
hatched, unle&s;s the internal heat of the mother
<PB N="312" REF="325">
was too great; for the degrees of heat nece&s;&s;a|ry
for hatching eggs are very limited; and the
lea&s;t exce&s;s or defect is equally fatal to this ope|ration.
The la&s;t eggs, therefore, laid by the hen,
containing the embryos in the &s;ame &s;tate as
the fir&s;t, prove nothing more than the nece&s;&s;i|ty
of their acquiring full perfection before they
can be hatched.</P>
<P>It is apparent, therefore, that the &s;tate of the
embryo when the egg is laid by the hen, is its
fir&s;t &s;tate, and that which immediately &s;ucceeds
impregnation; that it undergoes no interme|diate
changes of form; and con&s;equently, by
tracing, as Malpighius has done, its gradual ex|pan&s;ion,
hour after hour, we di&s;cover every
thing that it is po&s;&s;ible for us to know, unle&s;s
we could perceive the mixture of the two fluids,
and the manner in which the particles arrange
them&s;elves during the fir&s;t formation of the em|bryo.</P>
<P>If we reflect on this in&s;tantaneous fecundation
of a number of eggs, which are to be laid at &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
intervals, we &s;hall di&s;cover a new argument
again&s;t the exi&s;tence of eggs in viviparous ani|mals:
For, if women contained eggs, like hens,
why are not many of them fecundated at the
&s;ame time? Why does not one impregnation
give birth to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive race of children? And,
when women conceive two or three children,
why do they always come into the world at
the &s;ame time? If the&s;e foetu&s;es were produced
<PB N="313" REF="326">
from eggs, would they not &s;ucceed each other
according to the different &s;tates of perfection of
the &s;everal eggs at the time of impregnation?
And, would not &s;uperfoetations be as frequent
as they are rare, and as natural as they are acci|dental?</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to trace the gradual expan&s;ion
of the human foetus, as we can that of the chick
in the egg. The opportunities for ob&s;ervation
are few; and all we know of this &s;ubject is de|rived
from the writings of anatomi&s;ts, &s;urgeons,
and accoucheurs. It is from collecting all their
particular ob&s;ervations, and comparing their re|marks
with their de&s;criptions, that the following
abridged hi&s;tory of the human foetus has been
compiled.</P>
<P>Immediately after the mixture of the two &s;e|minal
fluids, it is probable that the whole mate|rials
of generation exi&s;t in the uterus under the
form of a &s;mall globe; for we learn from ana|tomi&s;ts,
that, three or four days after conception,
there is a &s;mall globular ma&s;s in the uterus, the
greate&s;t diameter of which is about 6 lines, and
the lea&s;t 4. This globe is formed by a de|licate
membrane, which contains a limpid li|quor
very like the white of an egg. We may
already perceive, in this liquor, &s;ome &s;mall fi|bres,
which are the fir&s;t rudiments of the foetus.
Upon the &s;urface of the globe there is a net|work
of delicate fibres, which extends from one
<PB N="314" REF="327">
of the extremities to the middle: The&s;e are the
fir&s;t ve&s;tiges of the placenta.</P>
<P>Seven days after conception, the lineaments
of the foetus are di&s;tingui&s;hable by the naked
eye. They are, however, very imperfect, and
have the appearance of a gelly almo&s;t tran&s;parent,
though it has acquired &s;ome degree of &s;olidity.
The head and trunk may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h|ed;
becau&s;e this ma&s;s is of an oblong figure, and
the trunk is longe&s;t and mo&s;t delicate. Some
&s;mall fibres, re&s;embling a plume of feathers, i&s;|&s;ue
from the middle of the foetus, and termi|nate
in the membrane in which it is inclo&s;ed.
The&s;e fibres are the rudiments of the umbilical
cord.</P>
<P>Fifteen days after conception, the head and
the mo&s;t prominent features of the face are ap|parent.
The no&s;e re&s;embles a &s;mall elevated
thread perpendicular to a line which marks the di|vi&s;ion
of the lips: Two &s;mall black points repre|&s;ent
the eyes; and we &s;ee two holes in place of ears.
The body of the foetus has al&s;o acquired &s;ome
growth. On each &s;ide of the &s;uperior and in|ferior
parts of the trunk, tho&s;e &s;mall protube|rances
appear, which are the rudiments of the
arms and legs. The length of the whole body
is about five French lines.</P>
<P>Eight days after, in all three weeks, the body
of the foetus is only augmented about a line:
But the arms and legs are apparent. The
growth of the arms is quicker than that of the
<PB N="315" REF="328">
legs; and the fingers &s;eparate &s;ooner than the
toes. The internal organization now begins to
be vi&s;ible: The bones appear like fine threads.
The ribs are di&s;po&s;ed on each &s;ide of the back-bone
like minute threads: The arms, the legs,
the fingers and toes, are al&s;o repre&s;ented by &s;i|milar
threads.</P>
<P>At one month, the foetus is more than an
inch in length: It naturally a&s;&s;umes a curved
po&s;ture in the middle of the liquor that &s;ur|rounds
it; and the membranes in which the
whole is included, are both augmented and
thickened. The whole ma&s;s is of an oval figure,
the greate&s;t diameter of which is about an inch
and a half, and the lea&s;t about an inch and a
quarter. The human figure is no longer equi|vocal:
All the parts of the face are already
di&s;tingui&s;hable; the body is delineated; the
haunches and the belly are prominent; the
hands and legs are formed, and their fingers and
toes are divided; the &s;kin is thin and tran&s;pa|rent;
the vi&s;cera re&s;emble a knot or plexus of
&s;ibres; the ve&s;&s;els are like fine threads, and the
membranes are extremely delicate: The bones
are &s;till &s;oft, and it is only in a few places that
they have begun to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome degree of &s;oli|dity.
The ve&s;&s;els which form the umbilical cord
lie parallel to each other in a &s;traight line. The
placenta now occupies only a third of the whole
ma&s;s, in&s;tead of a half, which it did during the
fir&s;t days; the &s;uperficial growth of the placenta,
<PB N="316" REF="329">
therefore, has not been &s;o great as that of the
foetus and ma&s;s; but it has received a great
augmentation in &s;olidity; it has become pro|portionally
thicker than the membranes of the
foetus, both of which are now di&s;tingui&s;hable.</P>
<P>According to Hippocrates, the male foetus
expands &s;ooner than the female.</P>
<P>At the end of &s;ix weeks, the foetus is about
two inches long, and the human form begins to
be more perfect, only the head is very large in
proportion to the other parts of the body. A|bout
this time the motion of the heart becomes
vi&s;ible: In 50 days, the heart has been percei|ved
to beat for a con&s;iderable time after the
foetus was extracted from the uterus.</P>
<P>In two months, the foetus is more than two
inches in length; and the o&s;&s;i&s;ication is per|ceptible
in the middle of the two arm-bones, in
the thigh and leg, and in the point of the under
jaw, which is then greatly advanced before the
upper. The&s;e, however, are only o&s;&s;eous points.
But, by means of a quicker growth, the clavi|cles
are entirely o&s;&s;ified: The umbilical cord is
formed, and the ve&s;&s;els which compo&s;e it begin
to twi&s;t like the threads of a rope: But this
cord is very &s;hort in compari&s;on of the length
it afterwards acquires.</P>
<P>In three months, the foetus is nearly three
inches long, and weighs about three ounces.
Hippocrates a&s;&s;erts, that at this time the motions
of the male foetus begin to be felt by the mo|ther;
<PB N="317" REF="330">
but that tho&s;e of the female are not per|ceptible
till four months. Some women, how|ever,
affirm that they have felt the motions of
the foetus at the beginning of the &s;econd month.
It is difficult to acquire any certain knowledge
on this &s;ubject: The &s;en&s;ations excited by the
fir&s;t movements of the foetus depend more, per|haps,
on the &s;en&s;ibility of the mother, than the
&s;trength of the child.</P>
<P>Four months and a half after conception, the
length of the foetus is from &s;ix to &s;even inches.
All the parts are greatly augmented, and ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other: Even the nails
appear on the fingers and toes. The te&s;ticles of
the male are &s;hut up in the belly above the kid|neys.
The &s;tomach is filled with a thick fluid,
&s;imilar to that which is contained in the amnios.
In the &s;mall guts we find a milky fluid, and a
black liquid matter in the great guts. There is
a &s;mall quantity of bile in the ve&s;ica felis, and
a little urine in the bladder. As the foetus
floats freely in the fluid that &s;urrounds it, there
is always &s;ome &s;pace between its body and the
membranes in which it is contained. The&s;e
membranes, at fir&s;t, grow more rapidly than the
foetus; but, after a certain time, the rever&s;e
takes place. Before the end of the third month,
the head is bent forward; the chin re&s;ts on the
brea&s;t; the knees are elevated, and the legs
folded back upon the thighs. One of the hands,
and often both, touch the face. Afterwards,
<PB N="318" REF="331">
when the foetus acquires more &s;trength, it per|petually
changes its po&s;ition, as we learn from
the following ob&s;ervations made by per&s;ons &s;kil|led
in the art of midwi&s;ery: 1. The umbilical
cord is often twi&s;ted round the body and mem|bers
of the child, in a manner that nece&s;&s;arily
&s;uppo&s;es different motions and po&s;itions. 2. Mo|thers
feel the motion of the child &s;ometimes on
one &s;ide of the uterus, and &s;ometimes on the o|ther;
and it often &s;trikes again&s;t many different
places, which could not happen unle&s;s it a&s;&s;umed
different po&s;itions. 3. As the foetus &s;wims in a
fluid which &s;urrounds it on all &s;ides, it may ea|&s;ily
turn, extend, and twi&s;t it&s;elf by its own
powers: It mu&s;t likewi&s;e take different &s;ituations,
according to the various attitudes of the mo|ther's
body; when the mother, for example,
lies down, the po&s;ition of the foetus mu&s;t differ
from what it is when &s;he &s;tands.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t anatomi&s;ts maintain, that the foetus is
obliged to bend its body, becau&s;e it is too much
confined by the membranes. But this opinion
&s;eems not to be well founded; for, during the
fir&s;t five or &s;ix months, at lea&s;t, there is room
more than &s;ufficient to admit a full exten&s;ion of
the foetus; and yet, during all this period, the
foetus is bended. We &s;ee likewi&s;e, that the
chick is bended in the liquor of the amnios,
while, at the &s;ame time, this membrane, and the
fluid it contains, afford room &s;ufficient to hold a
body five or &s;ix times larger than the foetus. We
<PB N="319" REF="332">
may, therefore, conclude, that the bended po|&s;ture
of the foetus is natural, and not the effect
of re&s;traint. I am inclined to think, with
Harvey, that the foetus takes this po&s;ture, be|cau&s;e
it is mo&s;t favourable to re&s;t and &s;leep;
for all animals bend their bodies when they want
to repo&s;e them&s;elves, or to &s;leep: And, as the
foetus &s;leeps almo&s;t continually, it naturally a&s;|&s;umes
this advantageous po&s;ition. 'Certe,' &s;ays
this celebrated anatomi&s;t, 'animalia omnia, dum

<P>The uterus, as formerly remarked, grows
very quickly after pregnancy; and it continues
to increa&s;e proportionally with the foetus. But
the growth of the foetus at la&s;t exceeds that of
the uterus; and it is natural to think, that the
foetus, when near maturity, is too much con|fined,
and agitates the uterus by repeated mo|tions.
The mother feels tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts,
which are called periodic pains, after the la|bour
of child-bearing commences. The more
force the foetus exerts in order to dilate the u|terus,
it finds an increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance from the
natural ela&s;ticity of the parts. Hence every ef|fort
<PB N="320" REF="333">
tends to open the os tincae, or orifice of the
uterus, which has already been gradually en|larged
during the la&s;t months of pregnancy.
The head of the foetus pu&s;hes along again&s;t the
margins of this orifice, and dilates it by a con|&s;tant
pre&s;&s;ure, till the moment of delivery,
when it opens &s;o wide as to allow a free pa&s;&s;age
to the child.</P>
<P>What renders it probable that the labour|-pains
are occa&s;ioned by the dilatation of the os
tincae is, that this dilatation is the only certain
mode of di&s;tingui&s;hing the real from the fal&s;e
pains. Women often feel very bri&s;k pains,
which are not tho&s;e that immediately precede
delivery. To di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e fal&s;e from the
true pains, Deventer advi&s;es the accoucheur to
feel the orifice of the uterus, and maintains, that,
if the pains be true, the dilatation will augment
upon the occa&s;ion of every pain; and that, on
the contrary, if the pains be fal&s;e, the orifice
will rather contract than dilate, or, at lea&s;t, that
it will not continue to dilate. Hence we may
conclude, that the&s;e pains proceed not from a
forced dilatation of the orifice of the uterus.
The only thing that is embarra&s;&s;ing, is the alter|nation
of pain and of ea&s;e experienced by the
mother. This circum&s;tance does not perfectly
corre&s;pond with the cau&s;e we have a&s;&s;igned;
for the gradual and continued dilatation of an
orifice &s;hould produce a con&s;tant pain, without
any intervals of ea&s;e. Perhaps the alternations
<PB N="321" REF="334">
may be a&s;cribed to the &s;eparation of the placen|ta:
It adheres to the uterus by the in&s;ertions of
a number of &s;mall papillae. May we not,
therefore, &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e papillae &s;eparate
not from their cavities all at once; and that the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;eparation of the&s;e papillae gives ri&s;e, at
different intervals, to the fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions of
pains? Here the effect perfectly corre&s;ponds
with the cau&s;e; and this conjecture may be &s;up|ported
by another remark: Immediately before
delivery, there i&s;&s;ues out a vi&s;cous whiti&s;h li|quor,
&s;imilar to that which flows from the pa|pillae
of the placenta, when torn from the u|terus.
It is therefore extremely probable, that
this liquor, which i&s;&s;ues from the uterus, is pro|duced
by the &s;eparation of &s;ome of the papillae
of the placenta.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that the foetus e&s;capes
from the uterus without bur&s;ting the membranes,
and, con&s;equently, without di&s;charging the li|quor
they contain. This &s;pecies of birth &s;eems
to be the mo&s;t natural, and is &s;imilar to that of
mo&s;t animals. The human foetus, however,
commonly pierces the membranes, by the re|&s;i&s;tance
it meets with at the orifice of the uterus:
And &s;ometimes a part of the amnios, and even
of the chorion, is brought away adhering to the
head of the child like a cap. As &s;oon as the
membranes are pierced or torn, the liquor, which
is called the <HI>waters,</HI> runs out, and, by lubrica|ting
the vagina and orifice of the uterus, facili|tates
the pa&s;&s;age of the child. After the di&s;charge
<PB N="322" REF="335">
of the waters, there is &s;ufficient room left in the
uterus for the midwife to return the child, when
its po&s;ition is unfavourable to the birth. After
the child comes into the world, the delivery is
not completed. The placenta and membranes
&s;till remain in the uterus; and the child is at|tached
to them by means of the umbilical cord:
They are ea&s;ily brought away by the hand of
the midwife; and &s;ometimes the weight of the
child is &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e or|gans,
which were nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of
the foetus, become u&s;ele&s;s, and even noxious to
the child, after its birth. They are, therefore,
in&s;tantly di&s;engaged from the child's body, by
ca&s;ting a knot on the umbilical cord, about an
inch from the navel, and by cutting the cord an
inch above the ligature. In &s;ix or &s;even days,
the remains of the cord dry up, and fall off clo&s;e
to the navel.</P>
<P>By examining the foetus before birth, we are
enabled to form &s;ome ideas concerning the me|chani&s;m
of its natural functions. There are or|gans
nece&s;&s;ary to it while in the womb of the
mother, but which become u&s;ele&s;s immediately
after birth. The better to comprehend the&s;e
functions, we mu&s;t explain more fully the na|ture
of the&s;e acce&s;&s;ory parts, the umbilical cord,
the membranes, with the liquor they contain,
and the placenta. The umbilical cord, which
is attached to the body of the foetus at the navel,
is compo&s;ed of two arteries and a vein: By
<PB N="323" REF="336">
the&s;e the cour&s;e of the circulation is lengthened;
but the vein is larger than the arteries. At the
extremity of the cord, each of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els di|vide
into an infinite number of ramifications,
and extend them&s;elves between two membranes.
They &s;et off from the common trunk in &s;uch a
manner, that the whole ramifications a&s;&s;ume a
round form, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name
of placenta, becau&s;e they re&s;emble a cake. The
central part of the placenta is thicker than its
edges: Its mean thickne&s;s is about an inch, and
its diameter is eight or nine inches, and &s;ome|times
more. The external &s;urface of it, which
is applied to the uterus, is convex, and the in|ternal
&s;urface is concave. The blood of the
foetus circulates in the cord and in the placenta.
The arteries of the cord proceed from two large
arteries in the foetus, and carry the blood
through all the arterial ramifications of the pla|centa;
and the blood is collected and returned
to the foetus by the venous branches of the pla|centa
and the umbilical vein.</P>
<P>The concave &s;urface of the placenta is cover|ed
with the chorion: Its convex &s;urface is al&s;o
covered with a &s;oft membrane, which &s;eems to
be a continuation of the chorion, and is ea&s;ily
torn; and the foetus is inclo&s;ed in the double
covering of the chorion and amnios. The figure
of the whole is globular; becau&s;e the intervals
between the foetus and membranes are filled
with a tran&s;parent fluid. This liquor is imme|diately
<PB N="324" REF="337">
confined by the amnios, which is the in|ternal
membrane: It is thin and tran&s;parent,
and folds it&s;elf round the umbilical cord, at its
in&s;ertion into the placenta, and continues to co|ver
it the whole way to the navel of the foetus.
The chorion is the external membrane; it is
thick, &s;pongy, and inter&s;per&s;ed with blood-ve&s;|&s;els.
It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal coats, the outermo&s;t
of which covers the convex &s;urface of the pla|centa.
It &s;ends off duplicatures to cover the
papillae, which are in&s;erted into the cavities at
the fundus of the uterus, called <HI>lacunae.</HI> The&s;e
in&s;ertions connect the foetus to the uterus.</P>
<P>Some anatomi&s;ts have maintained, that the
human foetus, like tho&s;e of certain quadrupeds,
was furni&s;hed with an <HI>allantois,</HI> a membrane
de&s;tined for the reception of the urine; and they
have pretended to have di&s;covered it between
the chorion and amnios, or in the middle of the
placenta, at the root of the umbilical cord, un|der
the form of a pretty large bladder; and that
it received the urine by means of a long tube
which made a part of the cord, and which open|ed
at one end into the bladder, and, at the others,
into the allantois, an&s;wering the &s;ame purpo&s;es
as the urachus in other animals. They acknow|ledge,
however, that the urachus of the human
foetus is not near &s;o large as in the quadrupeds;
but they a&s;&s;ert that it is divided into a number
of &s;mall tubes, and that the urine pa&s;&s;es into
their cavities.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="338">
To the&s;e facts are oppo&s;ed the experience and
ob&s;ervation of mo&s;t anatomi&s;ts. They &s;eldom
find any ve&s;tiges of an allantois either between
the chorion and amnios, or in the placenta;
nor do they perceive any urachus in the umbi|lical
cord. A kind of ligament, indeed, runs
from the external &s;urface of the bottom of the
bladder to the navel; but, when entering the
cord, it becomes &s;o delicate as to be almo&s;t re|duced
to nothing. Neither is this ligament
commonly hollow; and we can perceive no cor|re&s;ponding
aperture in the bottom of the blad|der.</P>
<P>The foetus has no communication with the
open air; and the experiments made upon the
lungs demon&s;trate that they have never re&s;pired;
for they &s;ink in water, while tho&s;e of infants,
who have breathed, uniformly &s;wim: The foe|tus,
therefore, has no re&s;piration in the womb
of the mother; con&s;equently, it can make no
&s;ound with its voice, and all the &s;tories of chil|dren
groaning and crying before birth mu&s;t be
regarded as fabulous. After the waters run off,
however, the air may find admi&s;&s;ion into the
cavity of the uterus, and the child may begin
to re&s;pire before its birth. In this ca&s;e, the
child may cry, in the &s;ame manner as the chick|en
cries before the &s;hell of the egg is broken,
which it is enabled to do by means of the air
lodged in a cavity between the external mem|brane
and the &s;hell: This air exi&s;ts in all eggs,
<PB N="326" REF="339">
and is produced by the fermentation of the
matters they contain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vegetable Statics, chap. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lungs of the foetus, having no motion,
receive no more blood than is &s;ufficient for
their nouri&s;hment and growth: Another pa&s;&s;age,
therefore, is open for its circulation. The blood
in the right auricle of the heart, in&s;tead of pa&s;|&s;ing
into the pulmonary artery, and, after cir|culating
through the lungs, returning into the
left auricle by the pulmonary vein, pa&s;&s;es direct|ly
from the right to the left auricle, through an
aperture called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> which is in
the partition of the heart that &s;eparates the two
auricles: The blood then enters the aorta, by
the ramifications of which it is di&s;tributed to
every part of the body; it is then taken up by
the numerous branches of the veins, which gra|dually
unite into one trunk, called the <HI>vena cava,</HI>
that terminates in the right auricle of the heart.
The blood contained in this auricle does not all
pa&s;s through the foramen ovale; part of it e|&s;capes
into the pulmonary artery, but it enters
not into the body of the lungs; for there is a
communication between the pulmonary artery
and the aorta, by an arterial canal which leads
immediately from the one to the other. It is
by the&s;e means that the blood circulates in the
foetus, without entering the lungs, which it
does in children, in adults, and in all animals
who re&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="340">
It has been imagined by &s;ome, that the blood
of the mother pa&s;&s;es into the body of the foetus,
by means of the placenta and umbilical cord:
They &s;uppo&s;ed, that the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the u|terus
opened into the lacunae, and tho&s;e of the
placenta into the papillae, and that they ino&s;cu|lated
with one another. But this opinion is
contradicted by experiment. When the arteries
of the umbilical cord are injected, the liquor re|turns
by the veins, without any of it e&s;caping
externally. Be&s;ides, the papillae can be drawn
out of the lacunae in which they are lodged,
without any extrava&s;ation of blood either from
the uterus or placenta; from both there oozes
out a milky matter, which, we have already re|marked,
&s;erves for the nouri&s;hment of the foe|tus.
It is probable that this liquor enters the
veins of the placenta in the &s;ame manner as the
chyle enters the &s;ubclavian vein; and the pla|centa,
perhaps, performs the office of the lungs
in maturating the blood. One thing is certain,
that the blood appears much &s;ooner in the pla|centa
than in the foetus; and I have often ob|&s;erved,
in eggs which had been &s;it upon for a
day or two, that the blood appeared fir&s;t in the
membranes, and that their blood-ve&s;&s;els are nu|merous
and large, while the whole body of the
foetus, excepting the point where the&s;e blood-ve&s;&s;els
terminate, is only a white tran&s;parent
matter, in which there is not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige
of blood.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="341">
It has been imagined that the liquor of the
amnios is a nouri&s;hment received by the mouth
of the foetus. Some have even pretended to
have found this liquor in the &s;tomach, and to
have &s;een &s;everal foetu&s;es who wanted the um|bilical
cord entirely, and others who had only a
&s;mall portion of it, which had no connection
with the placenta. But, in this ca&s;e, may not
the liquor have pa&s;&s;ed into the body of the foe|tus
by the portion of the cord that remained, or
even by the navel it&s;elf? Be&s;ides, other facts
may be oppo&s;ed to the&s;e: Foetu&s;es have been
found, who&s;e lips were not &s;eparated; and o|thers
who&s;e oe&s;ophagus had no aperture. To
reconcile the&s;e facts, &s;ome anatomi&s;ts have main|tained,
that the aliment pa&s;&s;ed into the foetus
partly by the umbilical cord, and partly by the
mouth. But none of the&s;e opinions &s;eem to
have any foundation. The que&s;tion is not, how
the foetus alone, but how the whole apparatus
of generation, receive their growth and nouri&s;h|ment?
for the placenta, the liquor, and the
membranes, increa&s;e in bulk as well as the foe|tus;
and, con&s;equently, tho&s;e in&s;truments and
canals employed for receiving and tran&s;porting
nouri&s;hment to the foetus, are them&s;elves en|dowed
with a &s;pecies of life. The expan&s;ion
of the placenta and membranes is equally diffi|cult
to conceive as that of the foetus; and, it
may be &s;aid, with equal propriety, that the foe|tus
nouri&s;hes the placenta, as that the placenta
<PB N="329" REF="342">
nouri&s;hes the foetus. At the commencement
of growth, the whole ma&s;s floats in the uterus,
without any adhe&s;ion; and, of cour&s;e, the nou|ri&s;hment
can only be conveyed by an ab&s;orption
of the lacteous fluid contained in the uterus.
The placenta appears fir&s;t to attract this fluid,
which it converts into blood, and tran&s;ports by
the veins into the foetus. The <HI>liquor amnii</HI> &s;eems
to be nothing but this milky fluid in a purified
&s;tate, the quantity of which is augmented, by a
&s;imilar ab&s;orption, in proportion to the growth
of the membranes; and the foetus probably ab|&s;orbs
this liquor, which &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary for
its growth and nouri&s;hment: For, it is worthy
of remark, that the foetus, during the fir&s;t two
or three months, contains very little blood: It
is as white as ivory, and appears like a conge|ries
of lymph &s;omewhat con&s;olidated; and, as
the &s;kin is tran&s;parent, and all the parts extreme|ly
&s;oft, the body of the foetus may be ea&s;ily pe|netrated
by the fluid in which it &s;wims, and thus
receive the matter nece&s;&s;ary for its growth and
expan&s;ion. It may indeed be &s;uppo&s;ed that the
foetus afterwards receives nouri&s;hment by the
mouth; becau&s;e we find a liquor, &s;imilar to that
of the amnios, in the &s;tomach, urine in the blad|der,
and meconium, or excrement, in the inte|&s;tines;
and, as neither urine nor meconium ap|pear
in the amnios, it is natural to conclude,
that no excrements are voided by the foetus, e|&s;pecially
as &s;ome are born without having the
<PB N="330" REF="343">
anus perforated, and yet large quantities of me|conium
are found in their inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Though the foetus has no immediate connec|tion
with the uterus, but is only attached to it
by the &s;mall external papillae of the placenta;
though it has no communication with the blood
of the mother, but, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, is equally
independent of her as the egg is independent of
the hen which covers it; yet it has been main|tained,
that, whatever affects the mother, pro|duces
a &s;imilar effect upon the foetus, and that
the impre&s;&s;ions received by the former are com|municated
to the &s;en&s;orium of the latter. To
this imaginary influence have been attributed all
tho&s;e re&s;emblances, mon&s;tro&s;ities, and peculiar
marks which appear on the &s;kin of particular chil|dren.
Many of the&s;e marks I have examined,
and they uniformly appeared to be occa&s;ioned
only by a derangement in the texture of the
&s;kin. Every mark mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a faint
re&s;emblance to &s;omething or other: But &s;uch
re&s;emblances, I am per&s;uaded, depend more on
the imagination of tho&s;e who &s;ee them, than up|on
that of the mother. On this &s;ubject, the
marvellous has been pu&s;hed to an extreme de|gree.
The foetus has not only been &s;aid to bear
the real repre&s;entations of the appetites of the
mother, but that, by a &s;ingular &s;ympathy, the
marks which repre&s;ent &s;trawberries, cherries, &amp;c.
a&s;&s;umed a deeper colour during the &s;ea&s;on of
the&s;e fruits. A little attention, however, will
<PB N="331" REF="344">
convince us, that the&s;e changes of colour are
more frequent, and that they happen whenever
the motion of the blood is accelerated, whether
it be occa&s;ioned by the heat of &s;ummer, or by
any other cau&s;e. The marks are always either
yellow, or red, or black; becau&s;e the blood gives
the&s;e colours to the &s;kin when it enters in too
great quantities into the ve&s;&s;els. If the&s;e marks
were occa&s;ioned by the appetites of the mother,
why are not their forms and colours as various
as the objects of her de&s;ires? What a multitude
of &s;trange figures would be exhibited, if all the
whim&s;ical longings of a mother were written
upon the &s;kin of the child?</P>
<P>As our &s;en&s;ations have no re&s;emblance to the
objects which excite them, it is impo&s;&s;ible that
de&s;ire, fear, horror, or any other pa&s;&s;ion or emo|tion,
can produce real repre&s;entations of the ob|jects
by which they are occa&s;ioned. An infant
being, in this re&s;pect, equally independent of the
mother, as the egg is independent of the hen
that &s;its upon it, I &s;hould be equally induced to
believe, that the imagination of a hen, which
&s;aw by accident a cock's neck twi&s;ted, &s;hould
produce wry-necked chickens from the eggs &s;he
was hatching, as that a woman, who &s;aw a man
broke upon the wheel; &s;hould produce, by the
mere force of imagination, a child with all its
limbs broken.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing this fact to be well atte&s;ted, I
&s;till maintain that the imagination of the mother
<PB N="332" REF="345">
could not be the cau&s;e of it: For, what is the
effect of horror? An internal movement, or, if
you plea&s;e, a convul&s;ion of the mother's body,
which might alternately compre&s;s and &s;tretch
the uterus. What would be the re&s;ult of this
commotion? Nothing &s;imilar to its cau&s;e; for,
if the commotion was very violent, the foetus
might be killed, wounded, or have &s;ome of its
parts deranged: But how is it po&s;&s;ible to ima|gine
that this commotion &s;hould produce in the
foetus any thing &s;imilar to the thoughts of the
mother, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, with Harvey, that
the uterus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the faculty of conceiving
ideas, and of reali&s;ing them upon the foetus?</P>
<P>But, if the imagination of the mother has no
effect upon the foetus, it may &s;till be demanded,
Why did this child come into the world with
its members broken? Though a direct &s;olution
of a fact, which is both extraordinary and uncer|tain,
is not to be expected; yet, I think, this
que&s;tion admits of a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. Phae|nomena
of the mo&s;t uncommon kind, and which
are but rarely exhibited, as nece&s;&s;arily happen,
as tho&s;e that are u&s;ual and frequent. Among
the infinite combinations of which matter is ca|pable
of forming, arrangements of the mo&s;t pe|culiar
and extraordinary &s;pecies mu&s;t &s;ometimes
take place. Hence, out of the numberle&s;s chil|dren
which daily come into the world, one may
&s;ometimes appear with two heads, with four
legs, or with all its members broken. It is,
<PB N="333" REF="346">
therefore, within the circle of nature, that a
child, without the aid of the mother's imagina|tion,
may be born with its arms and legs bro|ken.
This phaenomenon may have been exhi|bited
oftener than once; the mother of this
child may, during her pregnancy, have &s;een a
man broken on the wheel; and the defects of
conformation in the child may have been attri|buted
to the impul&s;e made, by this dreadful
&s;pectacle, upon the imagination of the woman.
But, independent of this general &s;olution, the
fact may be explained in a more direct manner.
The foetus, as formerly remarked, has nothing
in common with the mother. Its functions, its
organs, its blood, its movements, are all peculiar,
and belong to it&s;elf alone. The only matter it
derives from the mother, is the liquor or nutri|tive
lymph which di&s;tills from the uterus. If
this lymph &s;uffers any change, if it be infected
with the venereal virus, the infant is affected
with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; and it is rea&s;onable to
think that all the di&s;ea&s;es which proceed from
viciated humours may be communicated from
the mother to the child. We know that the
&s;mall pox is communicated in this manner; and
we have too many examples of children, imme|diately
after birth, becoming innocent victims of
the debauchery of their parents. The veneral
virus attacks the mo&s;t &s;olid parts of the bones;
and it appears to act with more force upon the
middle of the bones, which is the part where the
<PB N="334" REF="347">
o&s;&s;ification fir&s;t commences, and is, of cour&s;e,
the mo&s;t hard and &s;olid part. I conceive, there|fore,
that the infant in que&s;tion has been affect|ed
with the venereal di&s;order while in the womb
of its mother, and that this was the rea&s;on why
it came into the world with its bones broken
through the middle.</P>
<P>The &s;ame effect might be produced by the
rickets: In the royal cabinet, there is a &s;keleton
of a rickety child, the bones of who&s;e legs and
arms are joined in the middle by a callus: From
in&s;pecting this &s;keleton, it appears that its bones
had been broken before birth, and afterwards re|united
by a callus.</P>
<P>But we have dwelt too long upon a fact which
credulity alone has rendered marvellous. Pre|judice,
e&s;pecially that &s;pecies of it which is
founded in wonder, will always triumph over
rea&s;on. It is needle&s;s to attempt to per&s;uade
women that the marks on their children have no
connection with their ungratified longings. I
have &s;ometimes a&s;ked them, before the birth of
a child, of what particular longings they had
been di&s;appointed, and, of cour&s;e, what marks
the child would bear? But I had only the &s;atis|faction
of perplexing, without convincing them.</P>
<P>The time of ge&s;tation is generally about nine
months; but it is &s;ometimes longer and &s;ome|times
&s;horter. Many children are born in the
&s;eventh and eighth, and &s;ome not till after the
ninth month: But, in general, the births before
<PB N="335" REF="348">
the ninth month are more frequent than tho&s;e
that exceed that term.</P>
<P>It is generally believed, that children born in
the eighth month cannot live, or, at lea&s;t, that
more of them die than of tho&s;e who come into
the world in the &s;eventh month. This opinion
appears to be paradoxical; and, if we con&s;ult
experience, I believe it will be found to be er|roneous.
A child born in the eighth month is
more perfectly formed, and con&s;equently more
vigorous and lively, than one who is born in the
&s;eventh. This opinion, however, is very com|monly
received, and is founded on the authori|ty
of Ari&s;totle: 'Caeteris animantibus ferendi
uteri unum e&s;t tempus, homini vero plura &s;unt;
quippe et &s;eptimo men&s;e et decimo na&s;citur,
atque etiam inter &s;eptimum et decimum po&s;itis;
qui enim men&s;e octavo na&s;cuntur, <HI>et&s;i minus,</HI>
tamen vivere po&s;&s;unt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide de Generat. anim. l. 4. c. ult.</NOTE>.' The beginning of the
&s;eventh month is the earlie&s;t term of delivery.
If the foetus be rejected &s;ooner, it dies, and is
denominated an abortion. Thus the time of
ge&s;tation is more various in the human &s;pecies
than in other animals; for it extends from the
7th to the 10th, and, perhaps, to the eleventh
month.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ured by women who have had ma|ny
children, that females remain longer in the
womb than males. If this be true, it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing
that female children &s;hould &s;ometimes be
<PB N="336" REF="349">
born in the 10th month. When infants come
into the world before the 9th month, they are
neither &s;o large nor &s;o well formed as tho&s;e who
appear not till a later period. Tho&s;e, on the
contrary, who remain in the womb till the 10th
month, are larger and better made; their hair is
longer; the growth of the teeth, though &s;till
concealed within the gums, is more advanced;
and the tone of their voice is deeper and more
di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>With regard to the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of deli|very,
there is much uncertainty. It is imagined
by &s;ome writers, that, when the foetus has ac|quired
a certain &s;ize, the capacity of the uterus
becomes too &s;mall for its retention, and that the
re&s;traint felt by the child obliges it to exert every
effort to break its pri&s;on. Others alledge, which
amounts nearly to the &s;ame thing, that the foe|tus
becomes too heavy to be &s;upported by the
uterus, which, therefore, opens to be di&s;charged
of its load. Neither of the&s;e rea&s;ons appear to
be &s;atisfactory: The uterus has always &s;ufficient
capacity and &s;trength to contain and &s;upport the
weight of a child of nine months; for it is often
loaded with two, during the &s;ame period; and it
is certain, that the weight and &s;ize of two chil|dren
of eight months, for example, exceed tho&s;e
of a &s;ingle infant of the &s;ame age. Be&s;ides, it is
not unfrequent that a child of nine months is
le&s;s than another at eight months, though it &s;till
remains in the womb.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="350">
Galen pretends that the foetus continues in
the uterus till it is able to take nouri&s;hment by
the mouth, and that the want of proper food
makes it re&s;tle&s;s, and anxious to e&s;cape. It has
been &s;aid by others, that the foetus is originally
nouri&s;hed by the mouth, but that, in proce&s;s of
time, the liquor amnii is &s;o contaminated with
the urine and tran&s;piration of the foetus, that it
becomes perfectly di&s;gu&s;tful, and obliges the
child to u&s;e every method to effect its e&s;cape
from the womb.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons &s;eem not to be more &s;atisfactory
than the former; for from them it would fol|low,
that the &s;malle&s;t and weake&s;t foetu&s;es would
nece&s;&s;arily remain longer in the womb than
tho&s;e of larger and more robu&s;t bodies; which
is by no means the ca&s;e. Be&s;ides, it is not for
nouri&s;hment that the child, immediately after
birth, &s;eems to be anxious; for it can di&s;pen&s;e
with the want of it for a con&s;iderable time after:
It appears, on the contrary, to be extremely de|&s;irous
of ea&s;ing it&s;elf of the &s;uperfluous load of
nouri&s;hment (the meconium) received in the
womb. This circum&s;tance induced Drelincourt,
and &s;ome other anatomi&s;ts, to think, that the
acrimony and unea&s;ine&s;s, ari&s;ing from an ac|cumulation
of excrement in the bowels, is the
rea&s;on why they become re&s;tle&s;s, and u&s;e every
effort to e&s;cape from the womb. I am not, I
acknowledge, more &s;atisfied with this explication
<PB N="338" REF="351">
than the others. If the child is pre&s;&s;ed with
faeces, why does it not evacuate them in the
liquor amnii? But this never happens. It ap|pears,
on th&egrave; contrary, that the nece&s;&s;ity of eva|cuating
the meconium is not felt till after birth,
when the motion of the diaphragm, occa&s;ioned
by re&s;piration, compre&s;&s;es the inte&s;tines, and
gives ri&s;e to this evacuation; e&s;pecially &s;ince no
meconium was found in the amnios of a foetus
of ten months, who had not re&s;pired, and &s;ince
an infant of &s;ix or &s;even months di&s;charges the
meconium &s;oon after re&s;piration.</P>
<P>Other anatomi&s;ts, and particularly Fabricius
ab Aquapendente, imagined that the foetus left
the uterus, from a de&s;ire of being refre&s;hed by
re&s;piration. But this cau&s;e &s;eems to be as chi|merical
as any that has been mentioned. It
is impo&s;&s;ible that a foetus can have any idea of
re&s;piration; and far le&s;s can it have any concep|tion
whether re&s;piration would be agreeable or
di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>After con&s;idering all the&s;e hypothe&s;es, I &s;u|&s;pect
that the delivery of the foetus depends on
a cau&s;e of a very different nature. The men|&s;trual
flux returns at &s;tated intervals. Though
its appearance be interrupted by impregnation,
its cau&s;e is not de&s;troyed; and, though no blood
is exhibited at the accu&s;tomed period; yet a re|volution
in the &s;y&s;tem, &s;imilar to what happens
before impregnation, mu&s;t take place. It is for
<PB N="339" REF="352">
this rea&s;on, that, in &s;ome women, the men&s;es
are not entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed during the fir&s;t two
or three months after conception. I imagine,
therefore, that this periodic revolution happens
as regularly after a woman has conceived as be|fore;
but that the blood is prevented from
flowing, by the excretories of the uterus being
&s;welled and &s;hut up, unle&s;s when it arrives in
&s;uch large quantities, and acts with &s;uch force,
as to overcome the re&s;i&s;tance which is oppo&s;ed
to it. In this ca&s;e, a great quantity of blood
ru&s;hes out, and an abortion is the con&s;equence.
But it frequently happens, that a &s;mall quantity
of blood appears, without producing this effect;
becau&s;e the blood has only been able to open a
few of the canals or excretories of the uterus,
while the re&s;t remain entirely ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Though no blood appears, which is generally
the ca&s;e, the fir&s;t revolution fails not to be ac|companied
with the &s;ame painful &s;ymptoms.
During the fir&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the men&s;es,
therefore, the uterus is affected with a con&s;ide|rable
agitation, which, when a little augmented,
entirely de&s;troys the product of generation.
Hence, we may rea&s;onably conclude, that few
of tho&s;e conceptions, which happen a &s;hort time
before the accu&s;tomed return of the men&s;es, are
&s;ucce&s;sful; becau&s;e the action of the men&s;trual
blood ea&s;ily de&s;troys the feeble roots of a germ
&s;o tender and &s;o delicate. Tho&s;e conceptions,
on the contrary, which take place immediately
<PB N="340" REF="353">
after this periodic di&s;charge, &s;ucceed much bet|ter;
becau&s;e the foetus is allowed more time to
grow, and to fortify it&s;elf again&s;t the action of
the blood, when the next revolution happens in
the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>After the foetus has been enabled to re&s;i&s;t the
action of the fir&s;t revolution, the increa&s;e of its
growth, and of its attachment to the uterus, ren|der
it &s;till more capable of re&s;i&s;ting any of the
&s;ub&s;equent revolutions: Abortions, indeed,
&s;ometimes happen during every revolution; but
they are more rare in the middle period of ge|&s;tation,
than either at the beginning or near the
end of it. Why they are more frequent at the
beginning, has already been explained: It only
remains to &s;how why they are likewi&s;e more
frequent towards the end.</P>
<P>The foetus generally comes into the world du|ring
the tenth revolution of the men&s;es. When
it is born at the ninth or eighth, it lives, and is
not, therefore, regarded as an abortion. Some
have pretended to have &s;een in&s;tances of chil|dren
born at the &s;eventh, and even at the &s;ixth
revolution, who, notwith&s;tanding this unfavour|able
circum&s;tance, continued to live. There is
no difference between abortion and birth, but
what relates to the living powers of the child.
In general, the number of abortions in the fir&s;t,
&s;econd, and third months, for the rea&s;ons already
a&s;&s;igned, is very great; and the number of pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters"> births,
in the &s;eventh and eighth months,
<PB N="341" REF="354">
is al&s;o very great, in proportion to the abortions
in the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth months; becau&s;e,
during this middle term of ge&s;tation, the pro|duct
of generation having acquired &s;trength and
&s;olidity &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the action of the fir&s;t
four periodic revolutions, a more violent effort
than any of the former is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy
it. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, an abortion is more
difficult during the fifth and &s;ixth months. But
the foetus, which till now was weak, and could
only exert its own force in a feeble manner,
begins to move with more vigour; and, when
the eighth revolution takes place, the efforts of
the foetus uniting with tho&s;e of the uterus, and
facilitating its exclu&s;ion, the foetus may come
into the world in the &s;eventh month, and be in
a capacity of living, whenever it happens to be
unu&s;ually &s;trong at this period. But, if the foe|tus
be excluded &s;olely from a weakne&s;s of the
uterus, which renders it unable to re&s;i&s;t the ac|tion
of the blood during the eighth revolution,
the birth of it is con&s;idered as an abortion, and
the child dies. But &s;uch ca&s;es are uncommon;
for, it the foetus has re&s;i&s;ted the fir&s;t &s;even re|volutions,
nothing but particular accidents can
prevent it from re&s;i&s;ting the eighth, unle&s;s it has
acquired more vigour than is common at this pe|riod.
A foetus which has acquired the &s;ame
degree of &s;trength, but at a later period, will be
excluded at the ninth revolution; and tho&s;e which
require nine months in obtaining this degree of
<PB N="342" REF="355">
&s;trength, will be born at the tenth revolution,
which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual term. But, when the
foetus acquires not this degree of &s;trength and
perfection in nine months, it will remain in the
uterus till the eleventh, or even the twelfth re|volution,
that is, till the tenth or eleventh month:
Of &s;uch late births many examples are record|ed.</P>
<P>Other rea&s;ons, to confirm the opinion, that
the men&s;trual flux is the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of
births at different periods, may be produced.
The females of all animals which have no men|&s;es,
bring forth very nearly at the &s;ame terms:
The difference in the times of ge&s;tation is ex|tremely
&s;mall. We may, therefore, conclude,
that this variation, which is very great in wo|men,
proceeds from the action of the men&s;trual
blood, which is exerted at every periodic revo|lution.</P>
<P>We have already remarked, that the placenta
adheres to the uterus only by the papillae; that
there is no blood either in the&s;e papillae, or in
the lacunae in which they are in&s;erted; and that,
when they are &s;eparated, an operation which
requires no great effort, a milky liquor only i&s;|&s;ues
from them. Why, therefore, is the birth
of a child uniformly followed by a con&s;iderable
haemorrhage, fir&s;t of pure blood, and afterwards
of blood mixed with a watery fluid? This blood
proceeds not from the &s;eparation of the placen|ta;
for the papillae are drawn out of the lacunae
<PB N="343" REF="356">
without any effu&s;ion of blood. Delivery, there|fore,
which is nothing more than this &s;epara|tion,
ought to produce no haemorrhage. Is it
not more natural, on the contrary, to think, that
the action of the blood is the cau&s;e of the birth;
and that it is this men&s;trual blood alone which
forces the ve&s;&s;els of the empty uterus, and be|gins
to flow immediately after delivery, in the
&s;ame manner as it did before conception?</P>
<P>We know, that, for &s;ome time after conception,
the &s;ack which contains the product of gene|ration,
adheres not to the uterus. We have &s;een,
from the experiments of De Graaf, that, by
blowing upon the &s;mall globule, it is made to
change its po&s;ition. The adhe&s;ion to the uterus
is never very &s;trong: In the early periods of
ge&s;tation, the placenta is &s;lightly applied to the
uterus; and tho&s;e parts are only contiguous, or
joined by a mucilaginous matter which has hard|ly
any adhe&s;ion. How, then, &s;hould it happen,
that, in abortions of the fir&s;t or &s;econd month,
this globule never e&s;capes without being attend|ed
with a great effu&s;ion of blood? This effu&s;ion
cannot be occa&s;ioned by the pa&s;&s;age of the glo|bule,
which has no adhe&s;ion to the uterus. It
is by the action of the blood, on the contrary,
that the globule is extruded. Should we not,
therefore, conclude, that this is the men&s;trual
blood, which, by forcing the canals through
which it was accu&s;tomed to flow before impreg|nation,
<PB N="344" REF="357">
de&s;troys the product of conception, and
re&s;umes its ordinary cour&s;e?</P>
<P>The pains of child-bearing are principally
occa&s;ioned by this action of the blood; for, it
is well known, that they are equally violent in
abortions of two or three months, as in ordinary
births; and that many women feel, without ha|ving
conceived, very acute pains, whenever the
men&s;trual flux is about to appear. The&s;e pains
are of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which accompany
abortions or births. Ought we not, therefore,
to a&s;cribe them to the &s;ame cau&s;e?</P>
<P>It appears, then, that the periodic revolution
of the men&s;trual blood has great influence in
child-bearing, and that it is the cau&s;e why the
terms of delivery in women are more various
than in other animals which are not &s;ubject to
this di&s;charge, and which always bring forth at
the &s;ame times. It is al&s;o apparent, that the
revolution occa&s;ioned by the action of the men|&s;trual
blood is not the only cau&s;e of birth: The
action of the foetus it&s;elf contributes greatly to
this end; for there are in&s;tances of children ha|ving
made their e&s;cape from the uterus after the
death of the mother, which could only happen
from an exertion peculiar to the foetus.</P>
<P>The terms of ge&s;tation in cows, &s;heep, and
other animals, are always the &s;ame, and no hae|morrhage
attends their delivery. May we not,
therefore, conclude, that the blood di&s;charged
by women after delivery is the men&s;trual
<PB N="345" REF="358">
blood, and that the action of this blood upon
the uterus, during every periodic revolution, is
the rea&s;on why the human foetus is excluded at
&s;o many different terms? It is natural to i|magine,
that, if the females of viviparous ani|mals
had men&s;es like women, their deliveries
would be followed by an effu&s;ion of blood, and
be equally various in their terms. The foetu&s;es
of animals are brought forth covered with their
membranes; and it is &s;eldom that the mem|branes
are broken, or the waters flow before
their delivery. But the birth of a child, with
its membranes entire, is a rare phaenomenon.
This circum&s;tance &s;eems to evince, that human
foetu&s;es make greater efforts to e&s;cape from
their pri&s;on than tho&s;e of other animals, or that
the uterus of a woman affords not &s;o free a pa&s;|&s;age
to the child; for it is by the &s;truggles of
the foetus again&s;t the re&s;i&s;tance it meets with at
the orifice of the uterus, that the membranes
are torn.</P>

<HEAD>RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL animals are nouri&s;hed by vegetables,
or by other animals which feed upon vege|tables.
There is, therefore, in nature, a mat|ter
common to both, which &s;erves for the
growth and nouri&s;hment of every thing that
lives or vegetates. This matter can have no
other mode of effecting growth and nouri&s;h|ment,
but by a&s;&s;imilating it&s;elf to every part of
the animal or vegetable, and by intimately pe|netrating
the texture and <HI>form</HI> of the&s;e parts,
which I have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of
an <HI>internal mould.</HI> When this nutritive mat|ter
abounds more than is &s;ufficient for the
growth and expan&s;ion of the animal or vege|table,
it is detached from all parts of the body,
and depo&s;ited in one or &s;everal re&s;ervoirs, under
the form of a fluid. This fluid contains all the
particles which are analogous to the different parts
of the body, and, of cour&s;e, all that is nece&s;&s;ary
for the reproduction of a being in miniature
perfectly &s;imilar to the fir&s;t. In mo&s;t animals,
this &s;uperfluity of nutritive matter does not take
place till they have nearly acquired their full
growth; and hence it is that animals are not
capable of generating before this period.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="360">
When this nutritive and prolific matter, which
is univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, has pa&s;&s;ed through the
internal mould of an animal or vegetable, and
has found a proper matrix, it produces an ani|mal
or vegetable of the &s;ame &s;pecies. But,
when it finds not a &s;uitable matrix, it produces
organized beings different from animals or ve|getables,
as the moving and vegetating bodies
which appear in the &s;eminal fluids of animals,
and in the infu&s;ions of the buds of plants, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This prolific matter is compo&s;ed of organic
particles, which are always active, who&s;e motions
and actions are fixed or arre&s;ted by the brute
parts of matter in general, and particularly by
oily and &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances; but, as &s;oon as they
are di&s;engaged from this matter, which is fo|reign
to their nature, they re&s;ume their action,
and produce different &s;pecies of plants, and other
animated beings.</P>
<P>The effects of this prolific matter may be &s;een
by the micro&s;cope in the &s;eminal fluids of both
male and female animals. The &s;emen of vivi|parous
females is &s;iltrated through the glandu|lar
bodies which grow upon their te&s;ticles; and
the&s;e glandular bodies contain a con&s;iderable
quantity of &s;eminal fluid in their cavities. Ovi|parous
females, as well as the viviparous, have
a &s;eminal fluid, which is &s;till more active than
that of the viviparous. The &s;emen of the fe|male
is, in general, &s;imilar to that of the male,
when both are in a natural &s;tate. They decom|po&s;e
<PB N="348" REF="361">
in the &s;ame manner; they contain &s;imilar
organic particles; and they exhibit the very &s;ame
appearances.</P>
<P>All animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances contain a
great quantity of this organic and prolific mat|ter.
To di&s;cover it, we have only to &s;epa|rate
it from the brute matter in which it is
entangled; and this operation is effected by
infu&s;ing animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances in water:
The &s;alts melt; the oils &s;eparate; and the or|ganic
particles become evident by their move|ments.
They abound more in the &s;eminal fluid
than in any other parts of animals; or rather,
they are there more di&s;engaged from the brute
matter. Soon after fle&s;h is infu&s;ed, and while
it is only &s;lightly di&s;&s;olved, the organic matter
appears under the form of moving bodies, which
are nearly as large as tho&s;e in the &s;eminal fluid.
But, in proportion to the increa&s;e of the di&s;&s;olu|tion,
the &s;ize of the organic particles is dimini&s;h|ed,
and their motion is augmented; and, when
the fle&s;h is entirely decompo&s;ed or corrupted,
the organic particles are extremely minute, and
their motion is inconceivably rapid. It is then
that this matter may be poi&s;onous, like that of
the viper's tooth, in which Mr Mead perceived
an infinite number of &s;mall pointed bodies, and
which he imagined to be &s;alts, though they are
nothing but the&s;e &s;ame organic particles in an
extremely active &s;tate. The pus which pro|ceeds
from wounds may acquire &s;uch a degree
<PB N="349" REF="362">
of putre&s;cency, as to become a poi&s;on of the
mo&s;t active kind; for, whenever this active
matter is exalted to a certain point, which may
always be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the rapidity and mi|nutene&s;s
of the moving bodies it contains, it
mu&s;t become a &s;pecies of poi&s;on. The &s;ame
thing may be remarked with regard to the poi|&s;on
of vegetables. The &s;ame matter which
nouri&s;hes us while in a natural &s;tate, will de|&s;troy
us when it is corrupted, as appears from
the gangrenes which affect the limbs of men and
other animals, when they are fed with corrupt|ed
grain; and from comparing the re&s;idue of
the food which adheres to our teeth, with that
which proceeds from the teeth of the viper or
of a mad dog, which is nothing but the &s;ame
matter too much exalted, and in the highe&s;t &s;tate
of putrefaction.</P>
<P>When large quantities of this organic and
prolific matter are collected in &s;ome part of an
animal, where it is obliged to remain, it there
forms living beings, which we have always re|garded
as real animals. The taenia, the a&s;ca|rides,
all the worms found in the veins, in the
liver, in wounds, in pus, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e which
are formed in putrified fle&s;h, have no other ori|gin.
The eels in pa&s;te, in vinegar, and all the
pretended micro&s;copic animals, are only diffe|rent
forms a&s;&s;umed, according to circum&s;tances,
by this active matter, which has a perpetual
tendency to organization.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="363">
In infu&s;ions of all animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances,
this prolific matter fir&s;t di&s;covers it&s;elf
under the form of vegetation: We &s;ee it form
into filaments, which grow and expand like
plants; then their extremities and joints &s;well
and bur&s;t, to give pa&s;&s;age to a multitude of mo|ving
bodies which have the &s;emblance of animals.
Nature, it would appear, begins all her opera|tions
by a kind of vegetable motion: This mo|tion
we perceive in a variety of micro&s;copic ob|jects,
and in the expan&s;ion of the animal embryo;
for a foetus, at fir&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only a &s;pecies of
vegetable growth or motion.</P>
<P>Sound food furni&s;hes none of the&s;e moving
particles for a con&s;iderable time: Fre&s;h meat,
grain, fruits, &amp;c. require &s;ome days infu&s;ion
before they exhibit any moving bodies. But
the more any matter is corrupted, decompo&s;ed,
or exalted, as pus, blighted grain, honey, the &s;e|minal
fluids, &amp;c. the&s;e moving bodies the &s;ooner
make their appearance. In &s;eminal fluids, they
are entirely free from other matter; and only a
few hours infu&s;ion are nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover
them in pus, corrupted grain, honey, &s;trong
drugs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence, therefore, of an organic ani|mated
matter, univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through all
animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, and which e|qually
&s;erves for their nouri&s;hment, their growth,
and their reproduction, is apparent. Nutrition
is effected by the intimate penetration of this
<PB N="351" REF="364">
matter through every part of animal or vege|table
bodies; expan&s;ion, or growth, is only a
more exten&s;ive &s;pecies of nutrition, which pro|ceeds
as long as the parts are ductile, and ca|pable
of being &s;tretched; and reproduction is an
effect of the &s;ame matter, when it &s;uperabounds
in the body of an animal or vegetable. Every
part of organized bodies &s;ends off to proper re|&s;ervoirs
the organic particles which are &s;uper|fluous
for its nouri&s;hment: The&s;e particles are
perfectly &s;imilar to the different parts from
which they are detached, becau&s;e they were
de&s;tined for the nouri&s;hment of tho&s;e parts.
Hence, when the whole particles &s;ent off from
every part of the body are a&s;&s;embled, they mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily form a &s;mall body &s;imilar to the ori|ginal,
becau&s;e every particle is &s;imilar to the
part from which it was detached. It is in this
manner that every &s;pecies of reproduction,
where only one individual is requi&s;ite, as that of
trees, plants, polypi, vine-fretters, &amp;c. is ef|fected.
This is al&s;o the fir&s;t method employed
by nature for the reproduction of &s;uch animals
as require the aid of different &s;exes; for the &s;e|minal
fluid of each &s;ex contains all the particles
nece&s;&s;ary for reproduction: But, to compleat
the operation, &s;omething more is requi&s;ite,
namely, the mixture of both fluids in a place
&s;uited to the expan&s;ion and growth of the foe|rus;
and this place is the uterus of the female.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="365">
There are, therefore, no pre-exi&s;ting germs,
or germs infinitely contained within each other.
But there is an organic matter diffu&s;ed through all
animated nature, which is always active, always
tending to form, to a&s;&s;imilate, and to produce
beings &s;imilar to tho&s;e which receive it. The &s;pe|cies
of animals and of vegetables, therefore,
can never be exhau&s;ted: As long as individuals
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, the different &s;pecies will be con&s;tantly
new; they are the &s;ame now that they were
three thou&s;and years ago: The whole will per|petually
exi&s;t by their own powers, unle&s;s they
be annihilated by the will of their Creator.</P>

the heart, the imagination, the &s;en&s;es, all con|&s;pire
to annihilate its exertions. Unchangeable,
however, in its nature, and invulnerable by its
e&s;&s;ence, it continues always the &s;ame. Its
&s;plendour may be ob&s;cured, without lo&s;ing its
force; it may enlighten us le&s;s, but it guides us
with certainty. Let us collect tho&s;e rays which
it &s;till emits, and the darkne&s;s which &s;urrounds
us will dimini&s;h; and, though the path &s;hould
not be equally illuminated from one end to the
other, we &s;hall at lea&s;t have a torch to prevent
us from wandering.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t difficult &s;tep, in arriving at
a proper knowledge of our&s;elves, is to acquire
di&s;tinct ideas of the two &s;ub&s;tances of which we
are compo&s;ed. Simply to affirm, that the one
is immaterial, unextended, and immortal, and
that the other is material, extended, and mor|tal,
is only denying tho&s;e qualities to the one,
which we know the other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. What real
knowledge can be acquired from this mode of
<PB N="355" REF="368">
negation? Such negative expre&s;&s;ions can com|municate
no po&s;itive idea. But, to &s;ay, that we
are certain of the exi&s;tence of the former, and
le&s;s a&s;&s;ured of that of the latter; that the &s;ub|&s;tance
of the one is &s;imple, indivi&s;ible, and has
no form, becau&s;e it manife&s;ts it&s;elf only by a
&s;ingle modification, which is that of thought;
that the other is le&s;s a &s;ub&s;tance, than a &s;ubject
capable of receiving &s;pecies of forms relative to
our &s;en&s;es, which are all as uncertain and as va|riable
as the organs them&s;elves; is advancing
one &s;tep towards a di&s;tinct idea of the nature of
the two &s;ub&s;tances: It is a&s;cribing to both dif|ferent
and peculiar properties; it a&s;&s;igns to them
po&s;itive qualities, and enables us to in&s;titute a
compari&s;on between them.</P>
<P>All our knowledge is ultimately derived from
compari&s;on. What is ab&s;olutely incomparable,
mu&s;t be incomprehen&s;ible. Of this God is the
only example: He cannot be comprehended,
becau&s;e he can be compared with no other be|ing.
But every thing which is &s;u&s;ceptible of
being compared, and of being relatively viewed
in different lights, becomes a &s;ource of human
knowledge. The more &s;ubjects of compari&s;on
which any object affords, the means of forming a
proper knowledge concerning it, are proportion|ally
increa&s;ed and facilitated.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of the &s;oul is &s;elf-evident: To
be, and to think, are, with regard to us, the &s;ame
thing. This truth is more than intuitive: It is
<PB N="356" REF="369">
independent of the &s;en&s;es, of the imagination, of
the memory, and of all our other relative facul|ties.
But the exi&s;tence of our bodies, and of
external objects, is doubtful to every unpreju|diced
rea&s;oner; for that exten&s;ion in length,
breadth, and thickne&s;s, which we call our bodies,
and which &s;eem to be &s;o intimately connected
with us, is nothing more than a relation of our
&s;en&s;es; and the organs of &s;en&s;ation them&s;elves
are only certain affinities with the objects which
affect them. Has the internal &s;en&s;e, the mind,
any thing common or &s;imilar to the&s;e organs?
Have the &s;en&s;ations produced by light or &s;ound,
any re&s;emblance to that &s;ubtile fluid which ex|cites
the idea of light, or to that vibration of the
air which conveys to us the notion of &s;ound?
The&s;e effects re&s;ult &s;olely from the nece&s;&s;ary and
intimate relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the eyes
and ears and the different matters which act up|on
them. But, as we have demon&s;trated, that
there is no re&s;emblance between &s;en&s;ations and
the objects which produce them, is not this a
&s;ufficient proof that the nature of the &s;oul is dif|ferent
from that of matter?</P>
<P>We may, therefore, con&s;ider it as an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
point, that internal &s;en&s;ation is totally dif|ferent
from its cau&s;e; and we have already
&s;hown, that, if external objects exi&s;t, they mu&s;t
be very different from the ideas we form of
them; becau&s;e &s;en&s;ation has not the mo&s;t di&s;tant
re&s;emblance to the objects by which it is excited.
<PB N="357" REF="370">
May we not hence conclude, that the cau&s;es of
our &s;en&s;ations nece&s;&s;arily differ from our notions
concerning them? That exten&s;ion which we
perceive by the eye, that impenetrability of which
we acquire the idea by touching, and all the other
con&s;tituent properties of matter, may have no
exi&s;tence; &s;ince our internal &s;en&s;ations of exten|&s;ion,
impenetrability, &amp;c. are neither extended
nor impenetrable, and po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing in com|mon
with the&s;e qualities.</P>
<P>As the mind, during &s;leep, is affected with
&s;en&s;ations which are often different from tho&s;e
excited by the actual pre&s;ence of the objects,
is it not natural to think, that the pre&s;ence of
objects is not nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of our
&s;en&s;ations, and, con&s;equently, that both mind
and body may exi&s;t independent of the&s;e objects?
For, during &s;leep, and after death, the body has
the &s;ame exi&s;tence as before, though the mind
recogni&s;es not this exi&s;tence, and, with regard to
us, the body entirely lo&s;es its being. Now I a&s;k,
if any object that can exi&s;t, and afterwards be
no more, which affects us in a manner totally
different from what it is, and from what it has
been, can be &s;o real as to leave no doubt of its
exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>We may &s;till, however, believe, though we
are uncertain, that &s;omething exi&s;ts without us;
but we cannot he&s;itate concerning the real ex|i&s;tence
of every thing within us. The exi&s;tence
of the &s;oul, therefore, is certain, and that of the
<PB N="358" REF="371">
body &s;eems to be doubtful. The mind has one
mode of perception when we &s;leep, and another
when we are awake; after death, &s;he will per|ceive
in a manner &s;till more different; and the
objects of &s;en&s;ation, or matter in general, may
then have no more exi&s;tence with regard to her,
than our bodies, with which we have no farther
connection.</P>
<P>But, though we admit the exi&s;tence of mat|ter,
and that it exi&s;ts in the very manner we per|ceive
it; yet, on comparing it with the mind, we
&s;hall find the latter endowed with qualities &s;o op|po&s;ite,
that we cannot he&s;itate concerning the
difference of its nature, and the &s;uperiority of
its rank.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to recogni&s;e the mind under
any other form than that of thinking, which is
extremely general, &s;imple, and uniform. This
form is not divi&s;ible, extended, impenetrable,
nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any other quality of matter. The
mind, therefore, which is the &s;ubject of this
form, mu&s;t be indivi&s;ible and immaterial. Our
bodies, on the contrary, as well as all external
objects, have many forms, each of which is com|pounded,
divi&s;ible, and de&s;tructible; and the
whole are only relative to the different organs
by which we perceive them. Our bodies, and
matter in general, therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;s no con&s;tant,
real, or univer&s;al properties, which can enable
us to acquire a certainty of their exi&s;tence. A
blind man has no idea of the images of bodies
<PB N="359" REF="372">
pre&s;ented to us by means of light. A leper,
who&s;e &s;kin was in&s;en&s;ible, could have none of
tho&s;e ideas which originate from the &s;en&s;e of
feeling. A deaf man knows nothing of &s;ound.
Suppo&s;ing a per&s;on to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively deprived
of the&s;e three in&s;truments of &s;en&s;ation, the mind
would &s;till exi&s;t, and manife&s;t it&s;elf by its own
internal power of thinking. But, if you ab|&s;tract
colour, exten&s;ion, &s;olidity, and all the o|ther
qualities of matter which have a relation to
our &s;en&s;es, matter, in this ca&s;e, would be entirely
annihilated: The mind, therefore, is inde&s;truc|tible;
but matter may, and mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning applies to the other fa|culties
of the mind, when compared with the
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential properties of matter. The mind
wills and commands; the body obeys as far as
it is able: The mind can unite it&s;elf, in an in|&s;tant,
to the mo&s;t di&s;tant or mo&s;t elevated ob|jects;
and nothing can prevent this union, when
&s;he commands it to be effected. But the body
is incapable of uniting with any object; it
is wounded by every thing that makes too clo&s;e
an approach to it. Every thing re&s;i&s;ts and be|comes
an ob&s;tacle to its motions, which are na|turally
&s;low. Is this will, then, nothing more
than a corporeal movement; and is contempla|tion
only a &s;imple contact? How could this
contact be effected with remote objects, or ab|&s;tract
&s;ubjects? Or how could this motion be in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly
accompli&s;hed? Without &s;pace and
<PB N="360" REF="373">
time, the idea of motion is inconceivable. The
will, therefore, if it be a motion, is not a mate|rial
motion; and, if the union of the mind with
its object be a contact, it mu&s;t be a contact, or
rather an intimate penetration, at a di&s;tance!
qualities which are the rever&s;e of tho&s;e of mat|ter,
and which, of cour&s;e, can only belong to
an immaterial being.</P>
<P>But I am apprehen&s;ive of having dwelt too
long upon a &s;ubject, which, by &s;ome, may be
regarded as foreign to the nature of this work.
What connection, it may be &s;aid, have metaphy|&s;ical
remarks on the mind with natural hi&s;tory?
If I were con&s;cious of abilities &s;ufficient for the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a topic &s;o elevated and exten&s;ive,
this reflection, I acknowledge, would not give
me any unea&s;ine&s;s; and I have abridged my
ob&s;ervations, &s;olely becau&s;e I de&s;paired of being
able to comprehend a &s;ubject &s;o immen&s;e, and
&s;o important in its nature. Why &s;hould the
noble&s;t part of man be rejected from his hi&s;tory?
Why thus prepo&s;terou&s;ly deba&s;e him, by con|&s;idering
him merely as an animal, while his na|ture
is &s;o different, and &s;o &s;uperior to that of the
brutes, that nothing but the mo&s;t brutal igno|rance
could ever dream of confounding them?</P>
<P>Man, it is true, re&s;embles the other animals
in the material part of his being; and, in the
enumeration of natural exi&s;tences, we are obliged
to rank him in the clais of animals. But, in
nature, there are neither cla&s;&s;es nor genera; all
<PB N="361" REF="374">
are mere independent individuals. Cla&s;&s;es and
genera are only the arbitrary operations of
our own fancy: And, though we place man
in one of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, we change not his nature;
we derogate not from his dignity; we alter not
his real condition; we only a&s;&s;ign him the fir&s;t
rank among beings which re&s;emble him &s;olely
in the material part of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>When we compare man with the animal
creation, we find in both a material organized
body, &s;en&s;es, fle&s;h and blood, motion, and ma|ny
other &s;triking re&s;emblances. But all the&s;e
analogies are external, and authori&s;e us not to
pronounce, that the nature of man is &s;imilar to
that of the brute. In order to acquire a di&s;tinct
idea concerning the nature of each, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
that we &s;hould have as complete a know|ledge
of the internal qualities of animals as we
have of our own. But, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to
know what pa&s;&s;es within animals, or how to
rank or e&s;timate their &s;en&s;ations, in relation to
tho&s;e of man, we can only judge by comparing
the effects which re&s;ult from the natural opera|tions
of both.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, con&s;ider the&s;e effects; and,
while we acknowledge all the particular re&s;em|blances,
we &s;hall only examine &s;ome of the mo&s;t
general di&s;tinctions. The mo&s;t &s;tupid man, it
will be admitted, is able to manage the mo&s;t a|lert
and &s;agacious animal: He governs it, and
makes it &s;ub&s;ervient to his purpo&s;es. This he
<PB N="362" REF="375">
effects not &s;o much by &s;trength or addre&s;s, as by
the &s;uperiority of his nature. He compells the
animal to obey him, by his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
rea&s;on, which enables him to project and to act
in a &s;y&s;tematic manner. The &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;agacious animals have not the capacity of com|manding
the inferior tribes, or of reducing them
to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. The &s;tronger, indeed,
devour the weaker: But this action implies on|ly
an urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and a voracious appe|tite,
qualities very different from that which
produces a train of actions all directed to one
common de&s;ign. If animals be endowed with
this faculty, why do not &s;ome of them a&s;&s;ume
the reigns of government over others, and force
them to furni&s;h their food, to watch over them,
and to relieve them when &s;ick or wounded?
But, among animals, there is no mark of &s;ubor|dination,
nor the lea&s;t trace of any of them be|ing
able to recognize or feel a &s;uperiority in his
nature above that of other &s;pecies. We &s;hould,
therefore, conclude, that all animals are of the
&s;ame nature, and that the nature of man is not
only far &s;uperior, but likewi&s;e of a very different
kind from that of the brute.</P>
<P>Man exhibits, by external &s;igns, what pa&s;&s;es
within him. He communicates his &s;entiments
by words; and this &s;ign is univer&s;al. The &s;a|vage
and the civilized man have the &s;ame powers
of utterance; both &s;peak naturally, and are e|qually
under&s;tood. It is not owing, as &s;ome
<PB N="363" REF="376">
have imagined, to a defect in their organs, that
animals are denied the faculty of &s;peech. The
tongue of a monkey has been di&s;covered by a|natomi&s;ts
to be as perfect as that of a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See M. Perault, Hi&s;tory of Animals.</NOTE>.
The monkey, therefore, would &s;peak, if it could
think. If the train of its thoughts were analo|gous
to that of ours, it would &s;peak the language
of men; and &s;uppo&s;ing the order and manner
of its thinking to be peculiar to the &s;pecies, it
would &s;till &s;peak a language intelligible to its
neighbours. But apes have never been di&s;co|vere
conver&s;ing together. In&s;tead, therefore,
of thinking in a manner analogous to man, they
&s;eem not to have the &s;malle&s;t order or train in
their thoughts. As they expre&s;s nothing that
exhibits combination or arrangement, it follows,
either that they do not think, or that the limits
of their thinking are extremely narrow.</P>
<P>As &s;everal &s;pecies of animals are capable of
being taught to pronounce words, and even to
repeat &s;entences, this is an invincible proof that
the want of &s;peech among animals is not owing
to any defect in their organs. Many other
brutes might, perhaps, be taught to articulate
words<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Leibnitz mentions a dog that had been taught to pro|nounce &s;everal French and German words.</NOTE>; but, to make them conceive the ideas
which the&s;e words expre&s;s, is beyond the power
of art. They &s;eem to articulate and to repeat
merely like an echo or a machine. They are
<PB N="364" REF="377">
defective, not in the mechani&s;m of their or|gans,
but in their intellectual powers.</P>
<P>Language implies a train of thinking; and it
is for this rea&s;on that brute animals are incapa|ble
of &s;peech: For, though we &s;hould allow them
to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething &s;imilar to our fir&s;t appre|hen&s;ions,
and to our mo&s;t gro&s;s and mechanical
&s;en&s;ations, it is certain that they are unable to
form that a&s;&s;ociation of ideas in which alone the
e&s;&s;ence of reflection and of thought con&s;i&s;ts.
They can neither think nor &s;peak, becau&s;e they
can neither join nor &s;eparate ideas; and, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on, they neither invent nor bring any
thing to perfection. If they were endowed with
the power of reflecting, even in the &s;lighte&s;t de|gree,
they would be capable of making &s;ome
progre&s;s, and acquire more indu&s;try; the pre|&s;ent
race of ca&s;tors would build their hou&s;es with
more art and &s;olidity than their progenitors; and
the bee would daily improve the cell which &s;he
inhabits: For, by &s;uppo&s;ing that this cell has all
the perfection of which it is capable, we a&s;cribe
to this in&s;ect a genius and under&s;tanding &s;uperi|or
to the human, by which it is enabled, at one
glance, to perceive the utmo&s;t point of perfec|tion
to which its work can be carried. But
man never can attain a clear view of this point:
Much time, reflection, and practice, are nece&s;&s;a|ry,
before the meane&s;t of our arts can be brought
to maturity.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="378">
Whence proceeds this uniformity in all the
operations of animals? Why does every &s;pecies
perform the &s;ame work in the very &s;ame man|ner?
And why is the execution of different in|dividuals
neither better nor wor&s;e than that of
every other? Can there be a &s;tronger proof that
their operations are only the re&s;ults of pure me|chanical
impul&s;e? If they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle &s;park
of that inward light which illuminates man|kind,
we &s;hould find variety, at lea&s;t, if not per|fection,
in their works; every individual would
exhibit &s;ome difference in his mode of execution.
But &s;uch differences never appear: They all
work upon the &s;ame plan; their mode of acting
runs through the whole &s;pecies, and is not pe|culiar
to any individual: If, therefore, we a|&s;cribe
to animals a mind or &s;oul, we mu&s;t allow
but one to every &s;pecies, of which each indivi|dual
has an equal &s;hare: This &s;oul would, of
cour&s;e, be divi&s;ible, and, con&s;equently, mate|rial,
and very different from ours.</P>
<P>Why, on the contrary, is &s;o much variety ex|hibited
in the operations of men? Why does
&s;ervile imitation co&s;t us more labour than origi|nal
de&s;ign? Becau&s;e our &s;ouls are proper to us,
and independent of any other; and becau&s;e we
po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing common to the &s;pecies, but the
matter which con&s;titutes our bodies, and by
which alone we have any re&s;emblance to the
brute creation.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="379">
If internal &s;en&s;ation depended on corporeal
organs, &s;hould not as great a variety appear in
the operations of the &s;ame &s;pecies of animals, as
in tho&s;e of men? Would not tho&s;e endowed
with finer organs build their ne&s;ts, and their
cells, in a manner more &s;olid, elegant, and com|modious?
If any individual had more genius
than another, would it not be rendered con&s;pi|cuous
by its mode of acting? But nothing of
this kind is ever exhibited: The greater or le&s;|&s;er
perfection of corporeal organs, therefore, has
no influence upon the nature of internal &s;en&s;a|tion.
From this circum&s;tance, we may &s;afely
conclude, that animals po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;en&s;ations of
this kind; that they neither belong to matter,
nor depend, as to their nature, upon the texture
of corporeal organs; and, of cour&s;e, that there
is in man a &s;ub&s;tance totally di&s;tinct from mat|ter,
which is the &s;ubject, and the cau&s;e that pro|duce
the&s;e &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>But the&s;e proofs of the immateriality of the
human mind may be extended &s;till farther. We
have often remarked, that Nature proceeds in
her operations by imperceptible degrees. This
truth, which otherwi&s;e admits of no exception,
is here totally rever&s;ed. Between the faculties
of man, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t minute animal,
the di&s;tance is infinite. This is a clear proof,
that the nature of man is different from that of
the brute creation; that he him&s;elf con&s;titutes a
&s;eparate cla&s;s, from which there are numberle&s;s
<PB N="367" REF="380">
degrees of de&s;cent, before we arrive at the &s;tate
of the mere animal; for, if man were of the
&s;ame rank with the animals, there would be in
nature a certain number of beings le&s;s perfect
than man, and &s;uperior to any animal we are
acquainted with; and tho&s;e intermediate beings
would de&s;cend imperceptibly from man to the
monkey tribes. But no &s;uch beings exi&s;t. The
pa&s;&s;age is &s;udden from a thinking being to a
material one, from intellectual faculties to me|chanical
powers, from order and de&s;ign to blind
impul&s;e, from reflection and choice to ungovern|able
appetite.</P>
<P>This is a &s;trong indication of the excellence
of our nature, and of the immen&s;e di&s;tance fix|ed
by the bounty of the Creator between men
and animals. Man is a rea&s;oning being; the a|nimal
is totally deprived of that noble faculty:
And, as there is no intermediate point between
a po&s;itive and a negative, between a rational and
an irrational animal, it is evident that man's na|ture
is entirely different from that of the animal;
that the latter only re&s;embles the former in the
external or material part; and that, to form a
judgment from this material re&s;emblance alone,
is &s;hutting our eyes voluntarily again&s;t that light
which enables us to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the internal nature of man,
and demon&s;trated the immateriality of his &s;oul,
we &s;hall next examine his external part, and
<PB N="368" REF="381">
give the hi&s;tory of his body. In the preceding
chapters, we have explained his formation and
expan&s;ion, and traced him to the very moment
of his birth: Let us now run over the different
ages of his life; and, after conducting him to
that period when he is &s;eparated from his body,
we &s;hall leave it to moulder in the common
ma&s;s of matter to which it originally belonged.</P>

An infant, at birth, pa&s;&s;es from one element
into another. When it e&s;capes from the waters
which &s;urrounded it in the womb of the mo|ther,
it is expo&s;ed to the air, and in&s;tantly feels
the impre&s;&s;ions of that active fluid. The air
acts upon the olfactory nerves, and upon the
organs of re&s;piration. This action produces a
&s;hock, a kind of &s;neezing, which expands the
che&s;t, and gives the air a free pa&s;&s;age into the
lungs, the ve&s;icles of which it dilates. After
the air remains for &s;ome time, it is heated and
rarified to a certain degree, and the &s;timulus or
&s;pring ari&s;ing from the dilatation of the fibres
re-acts upon this rarified fluid, and expells it
from the lungs. We will not here attempt to
explain the cau&s;es of the alternate motion of
re&s;piration, but &s;hall confine our&s;elves to its
effects.</P>
<P>This function is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the
exi&s;tence of man and of many other animals. If
re&s;piration cea&s;es, the animal mu&s;t peri&s;h; when
once commenced, it never &s;tops till death; and,
after the foetus begins to re&s;pire, it continues
this action without interruption. It is probable,
however, that the foramen ovale of the heart
does not clo&s;e immediately after birth, and, con&s;e|quently,
that part of the blood mu&s;t pa&s;s through
that aperture. The whole blood, therefore, en|ters
not, at fir&s;t, into the lungs; and a new-born
child may perhaps be deprived of air for a con|&s;iderable
time without &s;uffocation. This con|jecture
<PB N="371" REF="384">
&s;eems to be confirmed by &s;ome expe|riments
I lately made upon young dogs. I pro|cured
a pregnant bitch, of the large gray-hound
kind, and, when ju&s;t about to litter, I fixed her
&s;o in a bucket full of warm water, that her hin|der
parts were entirely covered. In this &s;itua|tion
&s;he brought forth three puppies, which,
after being di&s;engaged from their membranes,
were immer&s;ed in a fluid nearly of an equal
temperature with that of the amnios. After
a&s;&s;i&s;ting the mother, and wa&s;hing the puppies in
this water, I &s;uddenly removed them into a pail
of warm milk, without allowing them time to
re&s;pire. I put them into the milk, in preference
to the water, that they might have an opportu|nity
of taking &s;ome food, if they found a de&s;ire
for it. I kept them immer&s;ed in the milk for
more than half an hour; and, when taken out
of it, all the three were alive. They began to
breathe; and they di&s;charged a quantity of fluid
matter by the mouth. I allowed them to re|&s;pire
about half an hour, and again immer&s;ed
them in the warm milk, where they remained
another half hour. I then took them out: Two
of them were &s;till vigorous; but the third &s;eem|ed
to langui&s;h: I therefore ordered it to be car|ried
to the mother, which, be&s;ides the three
brought forth in the water, had littered other
&s;ix in the natural manner. The puppy which
was born in the water, and had continued one
half hour in warm milk, before it was allowed
<PB N="372" REF="385">
to breathe, and another half hour after it had
re&s;pired, &s;eemed to be very little incommoded;
for it &s;oon recovered, and was as active and live|ly
as tho&s;e which had received no injury. Of the
&s;ix that were brought forth in the air, I threw
away four; &s;o that there remained only two
with the mother, be&s;ide the one that had been
littered in the water. I continued my experi|ments
upon the other two which had been twice
immer&s;ed in the milk: After allowing them to
breathe about half an hour, I plunged them a
third time into the milk, where they remained
another half hour. Whether they &s;wallowed any
of the milk, I could not determine; but, when
removed, they appeared to be nearly as vigorous
as before their immer&s;ion. Having carried them
to the mother, however, one of them died that
&s;ame day; but I know not whether its death
was owing to &s;ome accident, or to the injury it
received from being plunged into the milk, and
deprived of air. The other lived as well as the
fir&s;t; and both grew up, and were equally vi|gorous
as tho&s;e which had not been &s;ubjected to
the experiment. I pu&s;hed the&s;e trials no far|ther:
But I learned enough to convince me,
that re&s;piration is not &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary
to the exi&s;tence of a new-born animal, as to an
adult; and that, by employing certain precau|tions,
it is, perhaps, po&s;&s;ible to keep the foramen
ovale open, and, by this means, produce excel|lent
divers, or a &s;pecies of amphibious animals,
<PB N="373" REF="386">
which would be able to live equally in air or in
water.</P>
<P>The air, on its fir&s;t entrance into the lungs,
generally meets with &s;ome ob&s;tacle, occa&s;ioned
by a fluid &s;ub&s;tance collected in the wind-pipe.
This ob&s;tacle is greater or le&s;s, in proportion to
the vi&s;cidne&s;s of the liquor. But the infant, at
birth, rai&s;es its head, which formerly reclined on
its brea&s;t; and, by this operation, the canal of
the wind-pipe is lengthened; the air, of cour&s;e,
ru&s;hes in, forces this fluid into the cells of the
lungs, which it dilates; and, in this manner, the
mucous &s;ub&s;tance, which oppo&s;ed the free pa&s;|&s;age
of the air, is diffu&s;ed through the whole
&s;ub&s;tance of the lungs. The perpetual admi&s;|&s;ion
of fre&s;h air &s;oon dries up this &s;uperfluous
moi&s;ture; or, if it &s;hould &s;till incommode the
infant, it excites a cough, and is thrown off by
expectoration, which generally runs out of the
mouth, becau&s;e the child has not yet &s;trength e|nough
to &s;pit.</P>
<P>We can remember nothing that pa&s;&s;es at this
early period of our exi&s;tence. It is, therefore,
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the feelings produced in
the child by the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the air. But
the cries and groans it utters immediately after
birth, are certain indications of the pain occa|&s;ioned
by the action of the atmo&s;phere. Till the
moment of birth, the infant is accu&s;tomed to the
mild warmth of a tranquil fluid. It is, therefore,
con&s;onant to rea&s;on, that the action of a fluid,
<PB N="374" REF="387">
unequal in its temperature, is too violent for the
lax and delicate fibres of a new-born infant. It
is equally &s;en&s;ible of heat and of cold: In every
&s;ituation it utters complaints; and pain appears
to be its fir&s;t and only &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t animals are blind for &s;ome days after
birth. Infants open their eyes the moment they
come-into the world; but their eyes are fixed
and dull: They have not that lu&s;tre and bril|liancy
they afterwards acquire; neither have they
tho&s;e motions which accompany di&s;tinct vi&s;ion.
But they &s;eem to feel the impre&s;&s;ion of light;
for the pupil contracts or dilates, in proportion
to the quantity of light. A new-born infant
cannot di&s;tingui&s;h objects; becau&s;e the organs
of vi&s;ion are &s;till imperfect: The cornea is
wrinkled; and perhaps the retina is too &s;oft and
lax for receiving the impre&s;&s;ions of external bo|dies,
and for producing the &s;en&s;ations peculiar
to di&s;tinct vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark may be applied to the other
&s;en&s;es. They have not yet acquired that force
and con&s;i&s;tency which their operation demand:
And, even when they arrive at this &s;tate, it is
long before the &s;en&s;ations of the infant can be
ju&s;t and complete. The &s;en&s;es are in&s;truments
of which we mu&s;t gradually learn the u&s;e. That
of vi&s;ion is the mo&s;t noble, and the mo&s;t won|derful;
but, at the &s;ame time, it is the mo&s;t un|certain
and elu&s;ory. The &s;en&s;ations produced
by it, if not rectified every moment by the &s;en&s;e
<PB N="375" REF="388">
of touching, would uniformly lead us into fal&s;e
conclu&s;ions. The &s;en&s;e of touching is the cri|terion
of all the other &s;en&s;es: It alone is e&s;&s;en|tial
to the animal exi&s;tence, and is univer&s;ally
diffu&s;ed through every part of the body. But
even this &s;en&s;e is imperfect at birth: A new|born
infant, indeed, di&s;covers &s;ymptoms of pain
by its cries and its groans; but it has no expre&s;|&s;ion
that indicates plea&s;ure. It begins not to
&s;mile in le&s;s than 40 days: It is about this time,
likewi&s;e, that it begins to weep; for its former
cries were not accompanied with tears. There
are no ve&s;tiges of the pa&s;&s;ions in the counte|nance
of a new-born child. The features of the
face have not acquired that con&s;i&s;tence and ela|&s;ticity
which are nece&s;&s;ary for expre&s;&s;ing the
&s;entiments of the mind. All the other parts of
the infant's body are extremely feeble; and
their motions are aukward and ill-directed. It
is unable to &s;tand erect; its thighs and legs are
&s;till bended, from the habit contracted while in
the womb of the mother; it has not &s;trength
to &s;tretch out its arms, or to lay hold of any
thing with its hands; and, if abandoned in this
condition, it would remain on its back without
being able to turn to one &s;ide or another.</P>
<P>From the&s;e remarks it appears, that the pain
felt by infants recently born, and which they
expre&s;s by crying, is only a corporeal &s;en&s;ation,
&s;imilar to that of other animals, who likewi&s;e
cry the moment they are brought forth; and
<PB N="376" REF="389">
that the mental &s;en&s;ation commences not &s;ooner
than 40 days after birth; for &s;miles and tears
are the effects of two internal &s;en&s;ations, which
both depend upon the action of the mind. The
former is an agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which origi|nates
from the &s;ight or remembrance of a
known and de&s;irable object: The latter is a
di&s;agreeable agitation, compounded of &s;ympathy
and anxiety concerning our own welfare. Both
the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions pre&s;uppo&s;e a certain degree of
knowledge, and a power of reflecting, and of
comparing ideas. Smiles and tears are expre&s;|&s;ions
of plea&s;ure and pain peculiar to the hu|man
&s;pecies; for the cries, the motions, and
the other marks of bodily pains and plea&s;ures,
are common to man and mo&s;t of the other ani|mals.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t now return to the material or|gans
and affections of the body. The &s;ize of an
infant born at the full time is generally about
21 inches, though &s;ome exceed, and others fall
much below this &s;tandard. The brea&s;t of a
child of 21 inches, mea&s;ured by the length of
the &s;ternum, is about three inches, and only
two, when the infant exceeds not 14 inches in
length. At nine months, a foetus generally
weighs from 12 to 14 pounds. The head is
large in proportion to the body; but this di&s;|proportion
gradually wears off, as the infant in|crea&s;es
in &s;ize. The &s;kin of a new-born child
is very fine, and of a reddi&s;h colour, its tran&s;|parency
<PB N="377" REF="390">
allowing a &s;light tint of the blood to
thine through. It is even alledged, that the red|der
the &s;kin of an infant is at birth, it will af|terwards
become the fairer and more beautiful.</P>
<P>The form of the body and members of in|fants,
recently after birth, is by no means per|fect.
The parts are too much rounded; and,
even when the child is in high health, they have
a &s;wollen appearance. A kind of jaundice ge|nerally
comes on at the end of three days; and,
at the &s;ame time, there is milk in the brea&s;ts of
infants, which is &s;queezed out by the fingers.
As the growth of the child increa&s;es, the &s;uper|fluous
juices and &s;welling of the parts gradually
dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>In &s;ome infants, a palpitation may be &s;een in
the fontanella, or open of the head; and, in
every child, the beating of the &s;inu&s;es, or arte|ries
of the brain, may be felt at this place. A|bove
this opening, a &s;pecies of &s;curf appears,
which is often very thick, and mu&s;t be rubbed
off with a bru&s;h, when it becomes dry. This
matter &s;eems to have &s;ome analogy to the horns
of quadrupeds, which likewi&s;e derive their ori|gin
from an opening in the &s;kull, and from the
&s;ub&s;tance of the brain. We &s;hall afterwards
&s;how, that the extremities of the nerves become
&s;olid when expo&s;ed to the air; and that horns,
nails, claws, &amp;c. are genuine productions of this
nervous &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="391">
The fluid contained in the amnios leaves up|on
the infant's body a vi&s;cid whiti&s;h matter,
which is &s;ometimes &s;o adhe&s;ive, that it requires
to be diluted with &s;ome mild liquid before it
can be removed. In this country, we always
wa&s;h the infant with warm liquors; but there
are whole nations, who inhabit climates much
colder than ours, where the infants are plunged
into cold water as &s;oon as they are born, with|out
receiving the &s;malle&s;t injury. The Laplan|ders
are even &s;aid to leave their new-born in|fants
in the &s;now till their re&s;piration is almo&s;t
&s;topped with cold, and then throw them into a
warm bath. This rough treatment is continued
three times every day for the fir&s;t year: And, af|ter
that period, the children are bathed thrice a
week in cold water. The inhabitants of the
northern regions are firmly per&s;uaded, that cold
bathing makes men more healthy and robu&s;t;
and, therefore, they enure their children to this
habit from their very birth. We are, indeed,
totally ignorant how far our bodies may be
rendered capable of &s;uffering, of acquiring, or
of lo&s;ing, by the power of habit. The &s;avages
in the i&s;thmus of America, when covered with
&s;weet, plunge them&s;elves into cold water with
impunity: The women throw their drunk hu&s;|bands
into the rivers, in order the more &s;peedily
to remove the effects of intoxication: The mo|thers
bathe in cold water along with their in|fants,
the moment after they are delivered; and
<PB N="379" REF="392">
yet much fewer of them die of child-bearing
than in other countries, where &s;uch a practice
would be regarded as extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>Infants, a few minutes after birth, and gene|rally
after feeling the heat of a &s;ire, di&s;charge
urine, and likewi&s;e the meconium or excrement,
which had been formed in the inte&s;tines during
their abode in the womb. But this la&s;t evacu|ation
does not always happen &s;o &s;oon; and,
when it is retarded during the fir&s;t day, the
child is often affected with colic pains; the di&s;|charge
mu&s;t, therefore, be promoted by proper
remedies. The meconium is black; and, when
it is entirely purged off, the &s;tools are of a whi|ti&s;h
colour. This change generally happens on
the &s;econd or third day. The odor of the ex|crement
becomes then more offen&s;ive than that
of the meconium; which is a proof that the
bile, and other bitter humours of the body, be|gin
to be mixed with it.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation &s;eems to confirm what was
formerly advanced concerning the growth and
nouri&s;hment of the foetus. We then remarked,
that the foetus was nouri&s;hed by ab&s;orption,
and that it received no food by the mouth. This
change in the odor of the excrement is a proof
that the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines of the foetus have
no action, or, at lea&s;t, that they act not in the
&s;ame manner, as after the motions communica|ted
to them by re&s;piration; &s;ince it is only after
this period that dige&s;tion, and the mixture of
<PB N="380" REF="393">
the bile and pancreatic juice with the food, takes
place in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. Thus,
though the bile and pancreatic juice are &s;ecreted
in the foetus, the&s;e liquors remain in their re&s;er|voirs,
and pa&s;s not into the inte&s;tines; becau&s;e,
like the &s;tomach, the&s;e re&s;ervoirs have yet no
motion or action &s;ufficient to make them empty
their contents into the receptacles of the food.</P>
<P>Before the child is allowed to &s;uck, we allow
it time to di&s;charge the &s;lime and meconium in
its &s;tomach and bowels. As the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances
might &s;our the milk, and produce bad effects,
we fir&s;t give the child a little wine and &s;ugar, in
order to fortify its &s;tomach, and to promote &s;uch
evacuations as are nece&s;&s;ary to prepare it for re|ceiving
and dige&s;ting its food. Ten or twelve
hours, therefore, ought to elap&s;e, before the
child be allowed to &s;uck for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>The infant has hardly e&s;caped from the womb
of its mother, and enjoyed the liberty of &s;tretch|ing
its limbs, when it is again condemned to a
more cruel and unnatural bondage. The head
of the little innocent is fixed; its legs are fetter|ed;
and its arms are bound down to its &s;ides;
and it is laced with bandages &s;o &s;trait, that it
cannot move a &s;ingle joint. It is a fortunate
circum&s;tance, when the &s;waddlings are not
drawn &s;o tight as to &s;top re&s;piration, or when
the midwife has the &s;en&s;e to lay the mi&s;erable
captive on its &s;ide, that the natural moi&s;ture may
&s;pontaneou&s;ly flow from its mouth; for it is de|nied
<PB N="381" REF="394">
the liberty of turning its head to facilitate
this natural and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;charge. Is it not
an in&s;tance of &s;uperior wi&s;dom in tho&s;e nations,
who &s;imply clothe their infants, without torment|ing
them with &s;waddling-bands? The Siame&s;e,
the Indians, the Japane&s;e, the Negroes, the &s;a|vages
of Canada, of Virginia, of Bra&s;il, and al|mo&s;t
all the inhabitants of South America, lay
their infants naked into hanging beds of cotton,
or put them into cradles lined with fur. The&s;e
practices are both &s;en&s;ible and humane: The
re&s;traint of &s;waddling-bands mu&s;t be painful.
The efforts made by infants to di&s;entangle them|&s;elves
have a more direct tendency to di&s;tort
their members, than any po&s;itions they could a&s;|&s;ume,
if left in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty.
Swaddling-bands may be compared to the &s;tays
worn by young girls, which occa&s;ion many
more deformities and di&s;ea&s;es than they are in|tended
to prevent.</P>
<P>If the efforts for liberty made by infants thus
fettered be hurtful, the inactivity to which they
are condemned is, perhaps, &s;till more noxious.
The want of exerci&s;e retards the growth of their
members, and dimini&s;hes the &s;trength of their
bodies; and, of cour&s;e, tho&s;e children who are
allowed full freedom of motion will be the mo&s;t
vigorous and healthy. It was this motive that
induced the Peruvians to leave the arms of their
infants perfectly loo&s;e, in a wide &s;wathing-bag:
Afterwards, when their children grew older,
<PB N="382" REF="395">
they put them up to the middle in a hole dug
out of the earth, and lined with linen; their
arms, by this contrivance, were at full liberty;
and they could move their heads, and bend their
bodies, without falling, or hurting them&s;elves.
As &s;oon as they were able to &s;tep, the brea&s;t was
pre&s;ented to them at a little di&s;tance, to entice
them to walk. The children of Negroes are
often expo&s;ed to greater difficulties before they
can approach the nipple; they cling round one
of the mother's hanches with their knees and
legs; they adhere &s;o fa&s;t, that they &s;upport
them&s;elves without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mother;
they lay hold of the brea&s;t with their hands;
and they continue to &s;uck without inconveni|ence
or danger of falling, though the mother
moves about or works at her ordinary labour.
The&s;e children begin to walk, or rather to creep
on their hands and knees, at the end of the &s;e|cond
month; and, by exerci&s;e, they acquire the
faculty of running, in this &s;ituation, with nearly
equal quickne&s;s as they do upon their feet.</P>
<P>Infants, recently after birth, &s;leep much; but
their &s;leep is often interrupted. As they likewi&s;e
require frequent nouri&s;hment, they ought to
have the brea&s;t once every two hours during the
day, and, in the night, as often as they awake.
At fir&s;t, they &s;leep almo&s;t continually; and they
&s;eem never to awake but when &s;timulated by
hunger or pain: Their &s;leep, therefore, gene|rally
terminates by a fit of crying. As, in the
<PB N="383" REF="396">
cradle, they are obliged to lie in the &s;ame po&s;i|tion,
and are chained down by bandages, this &s;i|tuation
&s;oon becomes painful. They are, be&s;ides,
often wet and chilled by their excrements, the
acrimony of which irritates their delicate and
&s;en&s;ible &s;kin. In this condition, the efforts of
children are extremely feeble; and their calls
for relief are expre&s;&s;ed by cries and groans.
This &s;uccour &s;hould always be &s;peedily admini|&s;tered;
or rather the inconveniencies they feel
&s;hould be prevented, by frequently changing
part of their cloathing. The &s;avages are &s;o at|tentive
to this article, that, though they cannot
change their furs &s;o often as we do our linen|cloths;
yet they &s;upply this defect by employ|ing
other &s;ub&s;tances, of which they have no oc|ca&s;ion
to be &s;paring. In North America, they
put wood du&s;t, which they obtain from trees
that have been corroded by worms, into the bot|tom
of the cradle, and renew it as often as ne|ce&s;&s;ary:
The children are laid upon this powder,
and covered with &s;kins. Though this powder
may, perhaps, be as &s;oft as our down-beds; yet
they u&s;e it not for the purpo&s;es of delicacy, but
becau&s;e it quickly ab&s;orbs moi&s;ture of every kind.
In Virginia, they place the child naked upon a
board covered with cotton, and provided with
a hole for the pa&s;&s;age of the excrement. The
cold in this country is unfavourable to &s;uch a
practice; but it is almo&s;t general in the ea&s;t of
Europe, and particularly in Turkey. This pre|caution
<PB N="384" REF="397">
has another advantage; it precludes all
kind of care, and prevents the dreadful effects
which too commonly re&s;ult from the common ne|gligence
of nur&s;es. Nothing inferior to mater|nal
affection can &s;upport that perpetual vigilance
and minute attention which the infantine &s;tate
requires. With what propriety, then, can &s;uch
exertions be expected from ignorant and mer|cenary
nur&s;es?</P>
<P>Some nur&s;es de&s;ert their children for &s;everal
hours, without feeling the &s;malle&s;t anxiety: O|thers
are &s;o callous as not to be affected with
their cries. In this &s;ituation the unfortunate
infants &s;eem to de&s;pair; they exert all the force
of which they are capable; and their cries only
cea&s;e when their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted. This
exce&s;&s;ive crying either occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es, or at
lea&s;t throws them into a &s;tate of la&s;&s;itude, which
deranges their con&s;titutions, and may have &s;ome
influence on their tempers. Indolent nur&s;es are
guilty of another abu&s;e: In&s;tead of employing
proper means for plea&s;ing the child, they rock
it violently in the cradle. This agitation con|fu&s;es
the brain, &s;tops the crying, and, if long con|tinued,
&s;tuns the child into &s;leep. But this for|ced
and unnatural &s;leep is only a palliative; it
removes not the original cau&s;e of complaint.
Long and violent rocking, on the contrary, may
di&s;order the &s;tomach and head, and lay the foun|dation
of future di&s;orders.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="398">
Before putting children into the cradle, we
ought to be certain that they want nothing;
and they &s;hould never be rocked with &s;uch vio|lence
as to confound or &s;tun them. If they
&s;leep not &s;ufficiently, a gentle and equal motion
may be employed. Neither &s;hould they be of|ten
rocked; for, if they be once accu&s;tomed to
this motion, they will not afterwards &s;leep with|out
it. Though children, when in health, &s;hould
&s;leep long without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art; yet their
con&s;titution may be injured by too much of it.
In this ca&s;e, they &s;hould be rou&s;ed by gentle
motion, by &s;oft and agreeable &s;ounds, and by a|mu&s;ing
them with brilliant objects. This is the
period when they receive the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions
from the &s;en&s;e, which are, perhaps, of more im|portance
during life than is generally imagined.</P>
<P>Infants always direct their eyes to the lighte&s;t
part of a room; and if, from the child's &s;itua|tion,
only one eye can &s;ee the mo&s;t luminous
part, the other, for want of equal exerci&s;e, will
not acquire equal &s;trength. To prevent this in|convenience,
the foot of the cradle, whether the
light proceeds from a window or a candle, &s;hould
be placed oppo&s;ite to the light: In this po&s;ition
both eyes receive the light at the &s;ame time, and
con&s;equently acquire, by exerci&s;e, an equal de|gree
of &s;trength: If one eye acquires more force
than the other, the child will &s;quint; for I have
el&s;ewhere proved, that an inequality of &s;trength

For the fir&s;t two months, the infant &s;hould
receive no other food than the milk of the mo|ther
or nur&s;e; and, if its con&s;titution be deli|cate,
this nouri&s;hment alone &s;hould be continued
during the third and fourth month. A child,
however robu&s;t, may be injured, if any other food
be admini&s;tered before the end of the fir&s;t month.
In Holland, in Italy, in Turkey, and through
the whole Levant, children are allowed no other
food during the fir&s;t year. The &s;avages of Ca|nada
nur&s;e their children four or five, and &s;ome|times
&s;ix or &s;even years. In our country, as
mo&s;t nur&s;es have not a &s;ufficient quantity of milk
to &s;atisfy the de&s;ires of their children, in order
to &s;pare it, they give them, even from the be|ginning,
a compo&s;ition of boiled bread and milk.
This nouri&s;hment appea&s;es hunger; but, as the
&s;tomach and inte&s;tines are yet too weak to di|ge&s;t
&s;uch a gro&s;s vi&s;cid &s;ub&s;tance, the children
are greatly hurt by it, and often die of indige|&s;tions.</P>
<P>The mile of animals, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity,
may &s;upply that of the mother: But then the
child &s;hould be obliged to &s;uck the animal's teat,
that it may receive the milk in an equal and pro|per
degree of heat, and that, by the action of
the mu&s;cles in &s;ucking, the milk may be mixed
with &s;aliva, which greatly promotes dige&s;tion.
I have known &s;everal pea&s;ants who had no other
nur&s;es than ewes; and yet they were equally
<PB N="387" REF="400">
vigorous as tho&s;e who had been nur&s;ed by their
mothers.</P>
<P>After two or three months, when the child
has acquired &s;ome &s;trength, it may have food
&s;omewhat more &s;olid, as flour baked with milk,
a &s;pecies of bread which gradually di&s;po&s;es the
&s;tomach to receive common bread, and &s;uch o|ther
nouri&s;hment as it mu&s;t afterwards be ac|cu&s;tomed
to.</P>
<P>The con&s;i&s;tence of liquid food is thus gradu|ally
increa&s;ed, that the child's &s;tomach may be
prepared to receive what is &s;till more &s;olid. In|fants,
during the fir&s;t year, are incapable of ma|&s;tication.
The rudiments of the teeth are &s;till
covered with the gums, which are &s;o &s;oft, that
they can have little effect upon hard &s;ub&s;tances.
Some nur&s;es, e&s;pecially among the common peo|ple,
fir&s;t chew the food, and then give it to their
children. Before reflecting on this practice, we
mu&s;t throw a&s;ide every idea of di&s;gu&s;t, of which
children, at this age, have not the lea&s;t concep|tion.
They are equally di&s;po&s;ed to receive nou|ri&s;hment
from the mouth of the nur&s;e, as from
her brea&s;ts. This cu&s;tom &s;eems to have origi|nated
from &s;ome natural in&s;tinct, for we meet
with it in many countries which are exceedingly
remote from each other; as in Italy, in Turkey,
in mo&s;t parts of A&s;ia, in America, in the Antilles,
in Canada, &amp;c. As it is the only way by which
the &s;tomachs of children can be &s;upplied with a
proper quantity of &s;aliva, I believe it is very u&s;e|ful
<PB N="388" REF="401">
to them. If the nur&s;e chews a bit of bread,
it is &s;oaked in her &s;aliva, which renders it fitter
for nouri&s;hment than if it had been diluted in
any other liquor. This practice, however, is
unnece&s;&s;ary after children are furni&s;hed with
teeth, which enable them to chew their food,
and to mix it with their own &s;aliva.</P>
<P>The <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> or cutting-teeth, are eight in
number, four in each jaw, and generally appear
about the &s;eventh month, though, in &s;ome ca&s;es,
not till the end of the fir&s;t year. The&s;e teeth
are often premature; for &s;ome children have
them at birth, and foetu&s;es have been found with
them completely formed long before the ordina|ry
time of ge&s;tation is fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The rudiments of the teeth are lodged in &s;oc|kets,
and covered with the gums: In the proce&s;s
of their growth, they extend their roots to the
bottom of the &s;ocket, and break through the
gums. This proce&s;s ob&s;erves not the ordinary
laws of Nature, which act continually on the hu|man
body, without occa&s;ioning any painful &s;en|&s;ation.
Here Nature makes a violent and pain|ful
effort, which is often attended with fatal
con&s;equences. Children, when teething, lo&s;e
their u&s;ual &s;prightline&s;s, and become peevi&s;h and
fretful. The gums are at fir&s;t red and &s;wel|led;
and, when the circulation of the blood is
nearly &s;topped by the pre&s;&s;ure of the teeth,
they turn whiti&s;h. Children perpetually apply
their fingers to the affected part, in order to re|move
<PB N="389" REF="402">
the irritation: To procure &s;till farther re|lief,
they are furni&s;hed with a piece of ivory,
coral, or any other hard &s;mooth &s;ub&s;tance, which
they rub again&s;t the gums. This operation re|laxes
the parts, affords a momentary ce&s;&s;ation of
pain, renders the gums thinner, and facilitates
their rupture. But, notwith&s;tanding every pre|caution,
the rupture of the gums is always ac|companied
with pain and danger. When the
gums are uncommonly &s;trong and rigid, they
re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of the teeth for a con&s;iderable
time, and occa&s;ion a violent inflammation, which
often proves fatal. The &s;imple operation of
cutting the gum, removes the inflammation, and
gives a free pa&s;&s;age to the teeth.</P>
<P>The canine or dog-teeth, which are four in
number, and &s;ituated next to the cutting-teeth,
generally appear in the ninth or tenth month.
About the end of the fir&s;t, or during the cour&s;e
of the &s;econd year, the 16 molares or grinders,
four on each &s;ide of the canine-teeth, cut the
gums. But the&s;e periods vary greatly in differ|ent
children.</P>
<P>The cutting-teeth, the dog-teeth, and the fir&s;t
four grinders, are generally &s;hed during the
fifth, &s;ixth, or &s;eventh year; and are commonly
replaced in the &s;eventh year, though &s;ometimes
not before the age of puberty. The &s;hedding
of the&s;e 16 teeth is occa&s;ioned by the expan&s;ion
of the rudiments of a &s;econd &s;et, which are &s;i|tuated
at the bottom of the &s;ockets, and, by
<PB N="390" REF="403">
their growth, pu&s;h out the fir&s;t &s;et. But there
is no &s;econd &s;et below the other grinders; and,
therefore, they never &s;hed but by accident, and
their lo&s;s is &s;eldom repaired.</P>
<P>There are &s;till other four teeth &s;ituated at the
extremity of each jaw. In &s;ome per&s;ons, the&s;e
teeth are entirely wanting: They &s;eldom appear
before the age of puberty, and &s;ometimes not
till a more advanced period. They are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the name of <HI>Wi&s;dom-teeth,</HI> and either
appear &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, or two at a time. It is ow|ing
to this irregularity in the wi&s;dom-teeth, that
the number of teeth is not uniformly the &s;ame,
which varies from 28 to 32. Women, it has
been alledged, have generally fewer teeth than
men.</P>
<P>Some authors maintain, that the human teeth,
like tho&s;e of certain animals, would continue to
grow during life, if they were not con&s;tantly
worn down by grinding the food. But this
notion &s;eems to be contradicted by experience;
for people who live upon liquid food have not
longer teeth than tho&s;e who eat the harde&s;t
kinds of aliment. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e who hold this
opinion, probably mi&s;take the tu&s;ks of certain
animals for their teeth. The tu&s;ks of the wild
bear, and of the elephant, for example, conti|nue
to grow during life; but their increa&s;e,
after they arrive at their natural &s;ize, is extreme|ly
doubtful. Tu&s;ks have a greater analogy to
horns than to teeth: But this is not a proper
<PB N="391" REF="404">
place for &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. We &s;hall only re|mark,
that, in children, the fir&s;t &s;et of teeth are
le&s;s &s;olid, and more loo&s;ely fixed in their &s;ockets,
than the &s;econd.</P>
<P>It has been often a&s;&s;erted, that the fir&s;t hair
of children is always brown; and that, after it
falls off, it is replaced by hair of different co|lours.
I am unable to determine whether this
remark be well founded; but the hair of mo&s;t
children is fair, and often entirely white. In
&s;ome it is red, and in others black: But in all
tho&s;e who are to have fair or brown complex|ions,
the hair is more or le&s;s fair in early infan|cy.
Tho&s;e who are to be fair have generally
blue eyes; tho&s;e who are to be red have yel|lowi&s;h
eyes; and tho&s;e who are to be brown
have eyes of a dark yellowi&s;h colour: But the&s;e
di&s;tinctions are imperfectly marked in children
recently after birth; becau&s;e their eyes are then
almo&s;t always blue.</P>
<P>When infants are allowed to cry long and
violently, ruptures are frequently the con&s;e|quence
of the efforts it makes. The&s;e are ea&s;ily
reduced by the application of bandages. But,
if this remedy be too long neglected, the di&s;ea&s;e
may continue during life. The limits to which
I have pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, permit me not to
mention all the di&s;ea&s;es incident to children. I
&s;hall only remark, on this &s;ubject, that worms,
with which they are often infe&s;ted, are produ|ced
from the nature of their food. Milk is a
<PB N="392" REF="405">
&s;pecies of chyle, a purely nutritive &s;ub&s;tance,
without any mixture: It, of cour&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts
entirely of organic and prolific matter, which,
when not properly dige&s;ted by the &s;tomach, and
applied to the nouri&s;hment and growth of the
body, a&s;&s;umes, by its natural activity, other
forms, and produces animated beings, or worms,
in &s;uch profu&s;ion, that the child is often in dan|ger
of being de&s;troyed by them. The bad ef|fects
occa&s;ioned by worms might perhaps be
prevented, by allowing children to drink a little
wine; becau&s;e fermented liquors have a tenden|cy
to prevent the generation of worms: They
likewi&s;e contain few organic nutritive particles;
and it is chiefly by acting on the &s;olids, that wine
communicates &s;trength to the body; for it con|tains
but little nouri&s;hment. Be&s;ides, mo&s;t chil|dren
are fond of wine; or, at lea&s;t, they are
ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to drink it.</P>
<P>Though the bodies of infants be extremely
delicate, they are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of cold than at
any other period of life. Their internal heat,
it would appear, is proportionally greater: The
quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e in children &s;eems to for|tify
this opinion. Small animals, for the &s;ame
rea&s;on, have unque&s;tionably more heat than large
ones; for the action of the heart and arteries
increa&s;es in proportion to the comparative &s;mall|ne&s;s
of animals. This takes place in the &s;ame,
as well as in different &s;pecies. The pul&s;e of an
infant, or of a little man, is more frequent than
<PB N="393" REF="406">
that of an adult, or of a large man. The pul&s;e
of an ox is &s;lower than that of a man; a dog's
pul&s;e is quicker; and the motion of the heart in
very &s;mall animals, as that of a &s;parrow, is &s;o
rapid that the &s;trokes can hardly be numbered.</P>
<P>The life of a child, till it be three years of
age, is extremely precarious. In the two or
three &s;ucceeding years, however, its life becomes
more certain; and, in the &s;ixth or &s;eventh year,
a child has a better chance of living than at any
other period. By con&s;ulting Simp&s;on's tables
of the degrees of mortality at different ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Simp&s;on's tables, publi&s;hed at London in the 1742.</NOTE>,
it appears, that, of a certain number of children
born at the &s;ame time, more than a fourth of
them died in the fir&s;t year, more than a third
in two years, and at lea&s;t one half in the fir&s;t
three years. If this calculation be ju&s;t, when a
child is born, we might lay a bet, that it would
not live above three years. This exhibits a
melancholy view of the human &s;pecies; for,
though a man who dies at the age of 21 is ge|nerally
lamented, as being prematurely deprived
of life; yet, according to the&s;e tables, one half
of mankind mu&s;t die before the termination of
three years; and, con&s;equently, every man who
lives more than three years, in&s;tead of complain|ing
of his fate, ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf as pe|culiarly
favoured by his Creator. But this mor|tality
of children is not nearly &s;o great in every
<PB N="394" REF="407">
place as in London: M. Dupr&eacute; de S. Maur has
demon&s;trated, by a number of experiments made
in France, that one half of the children born at
the &s;ame time are not extinct in le&s;s than &s;even
or eight years; and, therefore, we might in&s;ure
the life of a new-born child for &s;even or eight
years. When a child arrives at five, &s;ix, or
&s;even years, it appears, from the &s;ame experi|ments,
that its life is more certain than at any
other age; for we may then in&s;ure for 42 years
more. But, in proportion as it advances above
five, &s;ix, or &s;even years, the number of years it
will probably live con&s;tantly decrea&s;es. At 12,
for in&s;tance, the chance is equal only for 39
years, at 20 for 33<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, at 30 for 28, and &s;o on,
till the age of 85, when the chance is equal for
three years more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the tables at the end of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the growth of the human body, one thing
is exceedingly remarkable. The growth of the
foetus increa&s;es more and more, in equal times,
till it e&s;capes from the womb. The growth of
the child, on the contrary, gradually dimini&s;hes,
in equal times, till the age of puberty, to which
it makes a &s;udden bound, and &s;oon acquires its
full &s;tature. The foetus, at the end of the fir&s;t
month, is an inch long; at the end of the &s;e|cond
it is two inches and a quarter; in three
months, it is three inches and a quarter; in four
months, it is more than five inches; in five
<PB N="395" REF="408">
months, it is &s;ix and a half, or &s;even inches;
in &s;ix months, it is eight and a half, or nine
inches; in &s;even months, it is more than 11
inches; in eight months, it is 14 inches; and in
nine months, it is 18 inches. Though the&s;e
mea&s;ures vary in different &s;ubjects, yet the uni|form
re&s;ult is, that the foetus, in equal times,
has continued to have a proportionally greater
increa&s;e. But, if a child at birth be 18 inches
long, it will not acquire, for the next 12 months,
above &s;ix or &s;even inches more; that is, at the
end of the fir&s;t year, it will be 24 or 25 inches;
in two years it will only be 28 or 29 inches;
in three years it will be no more than 30, or, at
mo&s;t, 32 inches; and afterwards, till the age of
puberty, it will not acquire above one and a
half, or two inches, every year. Thus the foe|tus
grows more in one month, when near the
termination of its abode in the uterus, than the
child does in one year, till it arrives at the age
of puberty, when Nature &s;eems to make a &s;ud|den
effort to bring her work to maturity.</P>
<P>For pre&s;erving the health of children, virtu|ous
and whole&s;ome nur&s;es are of the utmo&s;t im|portance.
We have too many melancholy ex|amples
of certain di&s;ea&s;es being communicated
from the nur&s;e to the child, and from the child
to the nur&s;e. Whole villages have, in this man|ner,
been infected with the venereal virus.</P>
<P>Children, it is probable, would be much more
&s;trong and vigorous, if they were nur&s;ed by
<PB N="396" REF="409">
their mothers, who&s;e milk mu&s;t be more agree|able
to them than that of any other woman;
for the foetus is nouri&s;hed in the womb with a
liquor which has a great re&s;emblance to the
milk in the brea&s;ts. Thus the infant is, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, accu&s;tomed to the milk of the mother,
even before its birth. But the milk of another
woman is not only new to it, but is often of &s;o
different a nature, that it is difficult to reconcile
the child to the u&s;e of it. We &s;ometimes &s;ee
children, who cannot dige&s;t the milk of certain
women, langui&s;h and turn di&s;ea&s;ed; and, if
they are not &s;peedily &s;upplied with another nur&s;e,
they &s;oon peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more de&s;tructive to children
than the practice of crowding numbers of them
into the &s;ame ho&s;pital. Mo&s;t of them die of in|fectious
di&s;ea&s;es, which they would certainly
e&s;cape, if they were brought up in &s;eparate
hou&s;es, and particularly at a di&s;tance from great
towns. The &s;ame expence would be &s;ufficient
to &s;upport them; and numberle&s;s citizens, which
con&s;titute the riches of a &s;tate, would, by this
&s;imple and natural mode of treatment, be &s;aved
to the public.</P>
<P>Children begin the difficult ta&s;k of learning
to &s;peak about the 12th or 15th month. They
pronounce the vowel A with mo&s;t facility, be|cau&s;e
it requires only the opening of the mouth,
and forcing out the air. E requires the tongue
<PB N="397" REF="410">
to be rai&s;ed, at the &s;ame time that the lips are
opened. In pronouncing I, the tongue is &s;till
more elevated, and approaches the teeth of the
upper jaw. O requires the tongue to be depre&s;|&s;ed,
and the lips contracted; and, in the pro|nunciation
of U, the lips mu&s;t be &s;till more con|tracted,
and &s;omewhat extended. The fir&s;t con|&s;onants
articulated by children are tho&s;e which
require the lea&s;t motion of the organs. B, M,
and P, are mo&s;t ea&s;ily pronounced. B and P
only require the lips to be joined, and then
opened with celerity; and for M, they mu&s;t be
fir&s;t opened, and then quickly &s;hut. The arti|culation
of the other con&s;onants cannot be ef|fected
without more complicated movements.
The pronunciation of C, D, G, L, N, Q, R, S,
and T, depends upon particular motions of the
tongue, which are not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. F re|quires
a prolongation of &s;ound beyond any of
the other con&s;onants. Thus, of the vowels, A
is mo&s;t ea&s;ily pronounced; and, of the con&s;o|nants,
B, P, and M. It is for this rea&s;on that
children, in all countries, fir&s;t begin to articulate
the words <HI>Baba, Papa, Mama.</HI> The&s;e words are
the mo&s;t natural, only becau&s;e they are mo&s;t
ea&s;ily pronounced; and the letters of which
they are compo&s;ed mu&s;t exi&s;t in every language.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, however, that, as the
&s;ounds of &s;everal con&s;onants are very &s;imilar,
as tho&s;e of B and P, of C and S, of K and Q, of
<PB N="398" REF="411">
D and T, of F and V, of G and J, of G and K,
and of L and R, there may be many languages
in which the&s;e different con&s;onants are not em|ploved.
But, in every language, a B or a P, a
C or an S, a K or a Q, a D or a T, an F or a
V, a G or a J, an L or an R, are indi&s;pen&s;ible;
and, in the mo&s;t contracted alphabets, there mu&s;t
be at lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even con&s;onants; becau&s;e the
articulation of them is not complicated, and the
&s;ounds by which they are uttered are all di&s;tinct
and different from each other. Children who
cannot ea&s;ily pronounce R, &s;ub&s;titute L in place
of it, and T in place of D; becau&s;e the former
are more difficult to articulate than the latter:
And the &s;oftne&s;s or har&s;hne&s;s of a language, de|pends
on the choice of con&s;onants which are more
or le&s;s difficult to pronounce. But it is needle&s;s
to enlarge upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some children, at two years of age, articulate
di&s;tinctly, and repeat whatever is &s;aid to them;
but mo&s;t children require a longer time. It has
been remarked, that tho&s;e who are long before
they learn to &s;peak, never articulate with the
&s;ame facility as tho&s;e who acquire that faculty
more early. The latter may be taught to read
before they are three years of age; and I have
known children read amazingly at four. But,
after all, it is difficult to determine whether any
advantages are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> derived from &s;uch premature
in&s;truction. We have had &s;o many examples of
<PB N="399" REF="412">
prodigies of learning at four, at eight, at twelve,
and at &s;ixteen years, who turned out to be either
fools, or men of very little ability, at twenty-five,
that I am inclined to think, that the mo&s;t
common mode of education, by which Nature is
not prematurely forced, and which is di&s;creetly
proportioned to the &s;trength and capacity of chil|dren,
is &s;till the be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Puberty.</HEAD>
<P>PUBERTY commences where childhood
ends, and accompanies us through the af|ter
periods of life. Before puberty, Nature &s;eems
to have had nothing in view but the growth and
pre&s;ervation of her work. The provi&s;ion &s;he
has made for the infant extends no farther than
the nouri&s;hment and expan&s;ion of its members.
It lives, or rather enjoys a kind of vegetable ex|i&s;tence,
which is confined to it&s;elf, and which it
cannot communicate. But the principles of life
&s;oon multiply: We are &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;tock,
&s;ufficient not only for our own being, but which
enables us to be&s;tow exi&s;tence upon others. This
redundancy of life, the &s;ource of health and vi|gour,
can no longer be confined, but is &s;trongly
impelled to expand and diffu&s;e it&s;elf. The age
of puberty is accompanied with &s;everal external
and internal marks. It is the &s;pring of life; the
&s;ea&s;on of plea&s;ure. May we be enabled to write
the hi&s;tory of this critical period, without exci|ting
any ideas but what are &s;trictly philo&s;ophical!
<PB N="401" REF="414">
In the hi&s;tory of man, puberty, circumci&s;ion,
ca&s;tration, virginity, impotence, and many other
circum&s;tances, are articles too e&s;&s;ential to be o|mitted.
We &s;hall, therefore, endeavour to de|&s;cribe
them with that delicacy of &s;tyle, that phi|lo&s;ophical
apathy, which annihilate every loo&s;e
de&s;ire, and be&s;tow on words nothing more than
their &s;imple and primitive &s;ignification.</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion is a cu&s;tom of great antiquity, and
is &s;till practi&s;ed over the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia. A|mong
the Hebrews, the operation was performed
eight days after birth. In Turkey, it is delayed to
the &s;eventh or eighth year, and &s;ometimes to the
eleventh or twelfth. The children in Per&s;ia
are circumci&s;ed at the age of five or &s;ix; the
wound is healed with cau&s;tic or a&s;tringent pow|ders;
and burnt paper is very generally u&s;ed,
which, according to Chardin, is the be&s;t remedy.
This author tells us, that the operation, when
performed on grown per&s;ons, is attended with
con&s;iderable pain: That they are obliged to be
confined to the hou&s;e three or four weeks; and
that death is &s;ometimes the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In the Maldivia i&s;lands, children are circum|ci&s;ed
at the age of &s;even years. To render the
&s;kin &s;oft, they are bathed in the &s;ea &s;ix or &s;even
hours before the operation. The I&s;raelites made
u&s;e of a &s;harp &s;tone: The Jews ob&s;erve the &s;ame
mode in mo&s;t of their &s;ynagogues. But the
Mahometans employ a knife or a razor.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="415">
An operation &s;imilar to circumci&s;ion is nece&s;|&s;ary
in certain di&s;ea&s;es. It is a common opi|nion,
that the prepuces of the Turks, and of o|ther
nations where circumci&s;ion is practi&s;ed,
would naturally grow too long, if they were
not curtailed in childhood. Boulaye &s;ays, that
he has &s;een, in the de&s;erts of Arabia and Me&s;o|potamia,
on the banks of the Tigris and Eu|phrates,
numbers of Arabian boys who&s;e prepuces
were &s;o long as to render them incapable of ge|neration,
without the aid of circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The people of the Ea&s;t have likewi&s;e longer
eye-lids than the inhabitants of other nations.
The &s;kin of the eye-lids re&s;embles that of the
prepuce. But what relation can take place be|tween
the growth of tho&s;e di&s;tant parts?</P>
<P>Girls as well as boys are circumci&s;ed, upon
the borders of the Per&s;ic Gulph and the Red Sea.
But the&s;e people never perform the operation
till the girls have pa&s;&s;ed the age of puberty; be|cau&s;e
there is no redundance before that period.
In other climates, the exce&s;s of growth in the
nymphae appears more early; and is &s;o gene|ral
among certain people, as tho&s;e upon the ri|ver
Benin, that they circumci&s;e both girls and
boys eight or ten days after birth. The circum|ci&s;ion
of females was an antient cu&s;tom, even in
Africa. Herodotus mentions it among the u|&s;ages
of the Aethiopians.</P>
<P>Circumci&s;ion may, therefore, be founded on
nece&s;&s;ity; it has, at lea&s;t, propriety for its ob|ject.
<PB N="403" REF="416">
But <HI>infibulation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word &s;ignifies the operation of tying or &s;ewing parts together.</NOTE> and ca&s;tration mu&s;t have
ari&s;en from jealou&s;y alone. The&s;e ridiculous
and cruel operations have been invented by
gloomy and fanatical tyrants, who, actuated by
a mean envy, and a de&s;ire of monopolizing na|tural
plea&s;ures, enacted and enforced tho&s;e bar|barous
and bloody laws, which make privation
a virtue, and mutilation meritorious.</P>
<P>Boys are infibled by drawing the prepuce
forward, piercing it, and putting a &s;mall cord
through the holes, which remains till the cica|trice
of the oppo&s;ite &s;ides be formed: The cord
is then removed, and a ring &s;ub&s;tituted in its
place, which is made of &s;ufficient &s;trength to la&s;t
as long as the per&s;on who ordered the opera|tion
plea&s;es; and &s;ometimes it remains for life.
The ea&s;tern monks, who take on the vow of
cha&s;tity, employ a large ring, which renders a
breach of their oath impo&s;&s;ible. We &s;hall af|terwards
mention the method of infibling fe|males.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine any thing
too ridiculous upon this &s;ubject, which has not
been practi&s;ed by &s;ome men, either from mo|tives
of pa&s;&s;ion or of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>During infancy, there is &s;ometimes but one
te&s;ticle in the &s;crotum, and &s;ometimes none. We
mu&s;t not, however, conclude that children in
this &s;ituation are totally de&s;titute of the&s;e parts.
It often happens, that the te&s;ticles remain in the
<PB N="404" REF="417">
abdomen, or are entangled in the rings of the
mu&s;cles. But time generally removes the&s;e ob|&s;tacles;
and the te&s;tes de&s;cend into their proper
receptacle at the age of eight or ten, and &s;ome|times
not till the &s;ea&s;on of puberty. Parents,
therefore, have no rea&s;on to be anxious about
&s;uch of their children as &s;eemingly have no te|&s;tes,
or but one. The te&s;ticles of adults are &s;el|dom
concealed; becau&s;e nature, at the age of
puberty, makes &s;trong efforts to bring them to
light. The &s;ame effect is &s;ometimes produced
by di&s;ea&s;e, or violent motion, &s;uch as a leap, a
fall, &amp;c. Even when the te&s;ticles never make
their appearance, the purpo&s;es of generation are
not fru&s;traetd. Men of this kind are often en|dowed
with uncommon vigour.</P>
<P>There are men who have but one te&s;ticle.
This defect, however, is inoffen&s;ive; for it is
always uncommonly large. Some men have
three, and are, on that account, &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s
more vigour and bodily &s;trength. We learn,
from the animal creation, how greatly the&s;e
parts contribute to &s;trength and courage. How
different is an ox from a bull, a wedder from a
ram, and a capon from a cock?</P>
<P>The practice of ca&s;tration among mankind is
very exten&s;ive, and of great antiquity. It was
the puni&s;hment of adultery among the Aegyp|tians.
In the Roman dominions, the number of
cunuchs was con&s;iderable: At this day, the&s;e
mutilated males are employed through all A&s;ia
<PB N="405" REF="418">
and part of Africa, as guards upon the cha&s;tity
of the ladies. In Italy, this infamous, this cruel
operation, has nothing for its object but the im|provement
of the voice. The Hottentots cut
off one te&s;ticle, becau&s;e they imagine that this o|peration
renders them more &s;wift in the chace.
In other countries, the poor people mutilate their
children, to make them incapable of procreation,
and to prevent them from feeling tho&s;e excruci|ating
pangs which they them&s;elves &s;uffer, when
they want bread to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of ca&s;tration vary according to the
object in view. When the improvement of the
voice is intended, the two te&s;ticles are only cut
out. But men, who&s;e minds are inflamed with
jealou&s;y, would not believe their females to be
&s;afe in the cu&s;tody of &s;uch eunuchs: They em|ploy
none but &s;uch as have been deprived of the
whole external parts of generation.</P>
<P>But amputation is not the only means of ac|compli&s;hing
this end. Formerly, the growth
of the te&s;ticles was prevented, and their &s;truc|ture
de&s;troyed, without any inci&s;ion: They ba|thed
the infants in warm water and decoctions
of plants, and then pre&s;&s;ed and rubbed the te&s;ti|cles
for a long time, in order to de&s;troy their
texture. Others compre&s;&s;ed them with an in|&s;trument:
Some pretend, that this &s;pecies of ca|&s;tration
does not endanger life.</P>
<P>The amputation of the te&s;ticles is not very
dangerous: It may be done at any age; the
<PB N="406" REF="419">
time of infancy, however, is always preferable.
But the amputation of the whole external parts
of generation is often fatal, e&s;pecially if per|formed
after the age of fifteen years. Even in
the mo&s;t favourable time, which is from &s;even
to ten years of age, there is always great danger.
The difficulty of pre&s;erving eunuchs of this kind
render them exceedingly precious. Tavernier
informs us, that in Turkey, and Per&s;ia, they bring
five or &s;ix times the price of the other kind.
Chardin ob&s;erves, that the total amputation is
accompanied with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain; that
it is performed pretty &s;afely upon young chil|dren;
and is exceedingly dangerous after the
age of fifteen; that hardly a fourth part e&s;cape
with life; and that the wound is never cured in
le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. On the other hand, Pietro
della Valle a&s;&s;erts, that tho&s;e who &s;uffer this pu|ni&s;hment
in Per&s;ia for rapes, and other crimes
of that nature, heal ea&s;ily, though advanced in
years; and that they apply nothing but a&s;hes to
the wound. I know not whether tho&s;e who
underwent the &s;ame puni&s;hment in Aegypt, as
Diodorus Siculus relates, e&s;caped with equal ea&s;e.
According to Thevenot, va&s;t numbers of ne|groes,
who are forced by the Turks to &s;ubmit to
this operation, peri&s;h, even when it is per|formed
on children of eight or ten years of age.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides negro eunuchs, there are others at
Con&s;tantinople, throughout all Turkey, Per&s;ia,
&amp;c. who, for the mo&s;t part, are brought from
<PB N="407" REF="420">
the kingdom of Golconda, the penin&s;ula on this
&s;ide the Ganges, the kingdoms of A&s;&s;an, Aracan,
Pegu, and Malabar, where their colour is gray;
and from the Gulf of Bengal, where they are
of an olive colour: There are &s;ome white eu|nuchs
from Georgia and Circa&s;&s;ia; but their
number is &s;mall. Tavernier &s;ays, that, when
he was in the kingdom of Golconda, in the year
1657, 22000 males were ca&s;trated. The black
eunuchs come from Africa, and e&s;pecially from
Aethiopia. In proportion to the uggline&s;s and
horror of their appearance, they are the more
e&s;teemed, and bring a higher price. A very flat
no&s;e, a frightful a&s;pect, large thick lips, and, a|bove
all, black teeth placed at a great di&s;tance
from each other, are admired qualities in a eu|nuch.
The&s;e people have commonly fine white
teeth: But &s;uch teeth would be a capital defect
in a eunuch, who ought to be a hideous mon|&s;ter.</P>
<P>Eunuchs, who are only deprived of their te&s;ti|cles,
have a lively &s;en&s;e of titulation in what re|mains:
They have even the external &s;ign more
frequently than other men. The part which re|mains,
however, is generally &s;mall; for it con|tinues
nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate in which it was
before the operation. A eunuch ca&s;trated at
&s;even years of age, when arrived at 20, is no
better, with regard to this affair, than a child of
&s;even. Tho&s;e, on the other hand, who have
not undergone the operation till the age of pu|berty,
<PB N="408" REF="421">
or later, have parts nearly equal to tho&s;e
of &s;ound men.</P>
<P>Peculiar relations &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the throat
and the parts of generation, though we are to|tally
ignorant of their cau&s;es. Eunuchs have
no beard; their voice, though &s;trong and pier|cing,
can never reach a low or deep tone. Se|cret
di&s;ea&s;es often appear in the throat. The
remarkable &s;ympathy which &s;ome parts of the
body have with others, though at a di&s;tance,
and of a different nature, is a &s;ubject too much
neglected: We are apt to de&s;pi&s;e effects, when
we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;cover their cau&s;es. Hence
it is, that we never think of examining the&s;e re|lations
or &s;ympathies, although they are the
proper &s;pring of the animal con&s;titution. In
females, there is a remarkable &s;ympathy between
the uterus, brea&s;ts, and head. How many cu|rious
and u&s;eful facts of this nature might be
di&s;covered, if phy&s;icians paid more attention to
this intere&s;ting &s;ubject? It would produce more
enlightened views, and a more exten&s;ive utility,
than can ever be expected from a mere regi&s;ter
of anatomical names. It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;co|ver
the principles of animal motion: The &s;prings
which give life to organization are not to be
found in the mu&s;cles, veins, arteries, and nerves,
de&s;cribed with &s;uch minutene&s;s by anatomi&s;ts.
Organized bodies are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of internal powers,
upon which the gro&s;s laws of mechani&s;m have
no influence. In&s;tead of attempting to di&s;cover
<PB N="409" REF="422">
the&s;e powers, by attending to their effects, they
have been treated as ideal exi&s;tences; they have
cea&s;ed to be the objects of philo&s;ophical re|&s;earch.
They have at la&s;t rea&s;&s;umed their native
importance in the laws of gravitation, in elec|tive
attractions, in the phaenomena of electri|city,
&amp;c. But, notwith&s;tanding the evidence
and univer&s;ality of their exi&s;tence, as their ac|tion
is internal, as they are &s;olely objects of rea|&s;on,
and have little connection with the &s;en&s;es,
they are in danger of e&s;caping our ob&s;ervation,
and we admit them with difficulty; for judg|ment
is generally occupied and directed by ex|ternal
objects. We never imagine that the in|ternal
con&s;titution of animated beings ought to
be a principal object of inquiry. We conceive
that the human genius is limited to external
objects; and, therefore, we overlook every thing
that might lead to a more refined and &s;piritual
philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The antients, le&s;s limited in genius, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of a more comprehen&s;ive philo&s;ophy, were
not a&s;toni&s;hed to meet with facts which were
inexplicable: They viewed Nature through a
more tran&s;parent medium. A peculiar corre|&s;pondence
or &s;ympathy, was to them only a
phaenomenon; but, to us, becau&s;e not reducible
to &s;ome fanciful laws of motion, it is a paradox.
They knew that Nature produced her principal
effects by laws concealed from human eyes:
They knew, that, to trace her various laws and
<PB N="410" REF="423">
modes of operation, exceeded the powers of our
circum&s;cribed faculties. A certain number of
uniform and related effects, therefore, was to
them &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a cau&s;e, or law of
nature. Whether, according to the antients,
this &s;ympathy &s;hall be called a peculiar corre|&s;pondence
between different parts of the body,
or, according to the moderns, it &s;hall be con&s;i|dered
as an unknown relation in the action of
nerves, its exi&s;tence in the animal oeconomy is
univer&s;al; its effects, therefore, are of the utmo&s;t
importance to the theory of medicine, and can|not
be too diligently &s;crutinized. But this is not
the place for a full inve&s;tigation of &s;uch an im|portant
&s;ubject. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the
relation between the voice and the generative
organs takes place not only in eunuchs, but in
other men: It is even di&s;coverable in females.
In men, the voice changes at the age of puberty;
and in women, who have a &s;trong rough voice,
the pa&s;&s;ion of love is &s;u&s;pected to be violent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ymptom of puberty is a &s;en&s;e of
fullne&s;s and &s;tiffne&s;s in the groins; which is mo&s;t
perceptible when walking, or when the body is
bent forward. This &s;tiffne&s;s is often accompa|nied
with pretty &s;mart pain in the different joints
of the limbs: It is likewi&s;e accompanied with a
new and peculiar &s;en&s;ation in tho&s;e parts which
di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes. Small whiti&s;h tubercles
al&s;o begin to appear in the&s;e parts, which are the
germs of their natural veil. The voice, for a
con&s;iderable time, is rough and unequal; after
<PB N="411" REF="424">
which it becomes more full, articulate, and &s;trong.
This change is very con&s;picuous in boys; but it
is le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable in girls, becau&s;e their voices
are naturally more &s;harp.</P>
<P>The&s;e marks of puberty are common to both
&s;exes: But each &s;ex has marks peculiar to it&s;elf;
as the eruption of the men&s;es, and the expan&s;ion
of the brea&s;ts in women; the beard and faculty
of procreating in men. The&s;e marks, indeed,
are not always uniform. The beard, for ex|ample,
does not always appear preci&s;ely at the
age of puberty: There are even whole nations
who have hardly any beard. On the contrary,
there is no country where the age of puberty in
women is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by the enlargement
of the brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Among every race of mankind, the females
arrive at puberty &s;ooner than the males. But
the age of puberty is very different in different
countries. It &s;eems to depend upon the tempe|rature
of the climate and the quality of the food.
The children of citizens and of opulent parents,
who are generally fed with rich and nouri&s;hing
victuals, arrive &s;ooner at this &s;tate. But chil|dren
brought up in the country, or who&s;e pa|rents
are poor, require two or three years long|er;
becau&s;e their food is not only bad, but given
too &s;paringly. In the &s;outhern parts of Europe,
and in cities, girls arrive at puberty about the
age of 12, and boys about 14. But, in northern
climates, and in the country, girls hardly come
<PB N="412" REF="425">
to maturity till they are 14, and boys not before
16.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, Why are the females, in all
climates, capable of procreating &s;ooner than the
males? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y: The bodies of men
are larger and &s;tronger; their bones are harder,
and their mu&s;cles more compact; a longer time
is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for their growth. Be&s;ides,
as the growth of the body mu&s;t be nearly com|pleat
before a &s;uperfluous quantity of organic
juices can be accumulated in the parts de&s;tined
for generation, women, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t arrive
at maturity &s;ooner than men.</P>
<P>In the warme&s;t climates of A&s;ia, Africa, and
America, the age of puberty commences in girls
at ten, and &s;ometimes at nine. The periodic di&s;|charge,
though le&s;s abundant in warm climates,
appears much &s;ooner. The interval is nearly the
&s;ame in all nations. With regard to time, a
greater diver&s;ity takes place between individuals
than between nations. In the &s;ame climate and
nation, &s;ome females &s;uffer this evacuation every
15 days; others have an interval of &s;ix weeks:
But a month, or a few days more or le&s;s, is the
mo&s;t u&s;ual period.</P>
<P>The quantity evacuated &s;eems to depend up|on
the quantity of nouri&s;hment and of in&s;en&s;ible
per&s;piration. The di&s;charge is greate&s;t in fe|males
who eat largely and take little exerci&s;e:
It is lea&s;t in warm countries, where the per&s;pi|ration
is more copious. The quantity of this
<PB N="413" REF="426">
di&s;charge has been variou&s;ly e&s;timated. It is
indeed difficult to make an accurate mea&s;ure. In
different &s;ubjects, and different circum&s;tances, it
varies from one or two ounces to a pound, and
even more. It generally continues to flow three,
four, or five days; but &s;ometimes it remains for
&s;ix, &s;even, and even eight days. The cau&s;e of
this di&s;charge is generally a&s;cribed to a &s;uperflui|ty
of blood and nutritious juices. The &s;ymptoms
which precede it are certain indications of a
plethora, as heat, ten&s;ion, &s;welling, and the
pains felt not only in the parts them&s;elves, and
their environs, but in the mammae, which al&s;o
&s;well, and di&s;cover a &s;uperabundance of blood
by the colour of the areolae becoming then more
deep: The eyes likewi&s;e are heavy, and the &s;kin
below the orbits takes on a faint blue or a violet
colour: The cheeks glow; the head is heavy
and affected with pain; and, in a word, the
whole body is oppre&s;&s;ed with a &s;urcharge of
blood.</P>
<P>The growth of the body, in length, generally
terminates at the age of puberty. Before this
period, young people commonly &s;hoot up &s;everal
inches in a very &s;hort time. But the quickne&s;s
of growth is mo&s;t remarkable in the parts of ge|neration
of both &s;exes. In males, this growth
is only an augmentation in &s;ize: But, in females,
it often produces a &s;hrinking of &s;ome of the
parts, which has received different appellations
<PB N="414" REF="427">
from tho&s;e who have treated of the &s;igns of vir|ginity.</P>
<P>Men, jealous of pre-eminence of every kind,
have always di&s;covered a remarkable attachment
to prior and exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This &s;pecies
of folly has be&s;towed a phy&s;ical exi&s;tence upon
female virginity. Virginity, which is a mo|ral
being, a virtue exi&s;ting &s;olely in purity of
heart, has been metamorpho&s;ed into a phy&s;ical
object, in which mo&s;t men think them&s;elves
deeply intere&s;ted. This notion, accordingly, has
given ri&s;e to many ab&s;urd opinions, cu&s;toms, ce|remonies,
and &s;uper&s;titions; it has even given
authority to pains and puni&s;hments, to the mo&s;t
illicit abu&s;es, and to practices which &s;hock huma|nity.
Young women have been obliged to &s;ub|mit
to the examinations of ignorant matrons,
and to expo&s;e the &s;ecrets of nature to the eyes
of prejudi&s;ed phy&s;icians. They did not reflect,
that every indecency of this kind is a violent at|tack
again&s;t cha&s;tity; that every &s;ituation which
produces an internal blu&s;h, is a real pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>I have little hope of being able to eradicate
the ridiculous prejudices which have been form|ed
on this &s;ubject. Mankind always believe
what they wi&s;h to be true, however vain and
unrea&s;onable the foundations of their faith. But,
as it is the province of hi&s;tory to narrate not on|ly
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, and the circum&s;tances
of facts, but likewi&s;e the origin of popular opi|nions
and errors, I think it a nece&s;&s;ary article in
<PB N="415" REF="428">
the hi&s;tory of man, to examine this favourite i|dol
which he adores, to con&s;ider the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s
of his wor&s;hip, and to inquire whether Vir|ginity
be a real or a fabulous divinity.</P>
<P>Fallopius, Ve&s;alius, Diemerbroek, Riolan,
Bartholin, Hei&s;ter, Ruy&s;ch, and &s;ome other ana|tomi&s;ts,
maintain, that the membrane of the hy|men
has a real exi&s;tence, and that it ought to be
reckoned among the parts of generation peculi|ar
to females. They a&s;&s;ert, that it is a fle&s;hy mem|brane,
very thin in infants, but thicker in a|dults;
that it is &s;ituated under the orifice of the
urethra, and nearly &s;huts up the entrance of the
vagina; that it is perforated by a round or
oval hole, &s;o &s;mall as hardly to admit a pea
during infancy, or a large bean at the age of
puberty. The hymen, according to Win&s;low,
is a membranous fold, &s;ometimes circular, and
&s;ometimes &s;emilunar, with an aperture of a &s;mal|ler
or greater &s;ize in different &s;ubjects, &amp;c. On
the other hand, Ambro&s;e Par&eacute;, Dulaurent, Graaf,
Pineus, Dionis, Mauriceau, Palfyn, and other
anatomi&s;ts of equal authority with tho&s;e former|ly
mentioned, in&s;i&s;t, that the membrane of the
hymen is a mere chimera; that it is not natural
to young girls; and expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment
that any man &s;hould talk of it as a thing which
has a real and uniform exi&s;tence. They pro|duce
a multitude of experiments and ob&s;erva|tions
made upon &s;ubjects of different ages, in
which they could never di&s;cover any appearance
<PB N="416" REF="429">
of this membrane. They acknowledge, that
they have &s;ometimes, but very &s;eldom, &s;een tho&s;e
fle&s;hy protuberances called carunculae myrti|formes
connected by a membrane; but they
maintain that this membrane was preternatu|ral.
Anatomi&s;ts are not le&s;s divided with regard
to the number and qualities of the&s;e carunculae.
Are they only rugo&s;ities of the vagina? Are they
di&s;tinct and &s;eparate parts? Are they the remains
of the hymen? Is their number uniform? Does
only one, or many, accompany the &s;tate of vir|ginity?
All the&s;e que&s;tions have been &s;tated, and
each has received a different &s;olution.</P>
<P>This oppo&s;ition of &s;entiment, in a matter
which depends on in&s;pection, is an inconte&s;tible
proof, that mankind have often an ardent de&s;ire
to di&s;cover things in Nature which exi&s;t only in
their own imaginations. Many anatomi&s;ts of
reputation have never been able to di&s;cover ei|ther
the hymen or carunculae, even before the
age of puberty. Tho&s;e who &s;upport the con|trary
opinion, at the &s;ame time acknowledge,
that the&s;e parts are not always the &s;ame; that
their form, &s;ize, and texture, vary in different
&s;ubjects; that, in place of the hymen, &s;ome|times
there is but one caruncula, at other times
there are two or more united by a membrane;
that the &s;hape of the aperture is not uniform,
&amp;c. What is the con&s;equence? We mu&s;t con|clude,
that the cau&s;es of this mark of virginity
are equivocal and incon&s;tant; and that, even
<PB N="417" REF="430">
when they have exi&s;tence, they produce only an
effect of a tran&s;ient and variable nature. Ana|tomy
determines nothing with regard to the ex|i&s;tence
of the hymen and carunculae; it allows
us to reject the&s;e &s;ymptoms of virginity, be|cau&s;e
they are not only uncertain, but imaginary.</P>
<P>The effu&s;ion of blood, though a more com|mon
&s;ymptom, is not le&s;s equivocal. It has, in
all ages, been regarded as an infallible proof of
virginity. But it amounts to nothing, in all
tho&s;e ca&s;es where the entrance of the vagina is
naturally relaxed or dilated. Be&s;ides, the effu|&s;ion
of blood is not peculiar to virgins. Women
who have no preten&s;ions to virginity frequent|ly
experience this di&s;charge. Some di&s;charge
copiou&s;ly and often; others a &s;mall quantity,
and only once; and &s;ome have no &s;uch effu&s;ion.
This phaenomenon depends upon age, health,
&s;tructure of parts, and a number of circum&s;tan|ces.
Of the&s;e we &s;hall only enumerate a few,
and endeavour, at the &s;ame time, to inve&s;tigate
the true cau&s;es of the various phy&s;ical marks
which have been held forth as infallible charac|teri&s;tics
of female virginity.</P>
<P>At the time of puberty, the parts of both
&s;exes undergo a con&s;iderable change: Tho&s;e of
the male have then a growth &s;o quick, that they
arrive, in a year or two, at full maturity. Tho&s;e
of women increa&s;e likewi&s;e at this period. The
nymphae, in particular, which, though formerly
almo&s;t imperceptible, now become full and con|&s;picuous.
<PB N="418" REF="431">
The men&s;trual di&s;charge appears at
the &s;ame period. By an u&s;ual accumulation
of blood, all the parts &s;well, and approach to|wards
each other. The orifice of the vagina
contracts, though the dimen&s;ions of the vagina
it&s;elf be enlarged. The appearances produced
by this contraction are different in different &s;ub|jects;
for we are informed by anatomi&s;ts, that
there are &s;ometimes four, and &s;ometimes only
three, or two, <HI>carunculae</HI>; and that a circular or
&s;emilunar ring, or rather a &s;eries of folds, is a
common phaenomenon. But anatomi&s;ts have
neglected to tell us, that, whatever form this
contraction a&s;&s;umes, it never appears before the
age of puberty. In young girls, whom I have
had occa&s;ion to di&s;&s;ect, nothing of this kind
could be di&s;cerned; and, having collected many
facts concerning this &s;ubject, I can with confi|dence
a&s;&s;ert, that, when young women, before
puberty, have commerce with men, no effu&s;ion
of blood ever happens, unle&s;s the parts be great|ly
di&s;proportioned, or &s;ome violence is commit|ted.
On the other hand, at the time of puberty,
e&s;pecially when the females are regular, and in
good health, the&s;e effu&s;ions are common, and
produced by the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es. But tho&s;e
who are meagre, and &s;ubject to the fluor albus,
generally want this mark of virginity. The fre|quent
repetition of this flux of blood, and even
at con&s;iderable intervals of time, is an evident
demon&s;tration that it is only a deceitful appear|ance.
<PB N="419" REF="432">
It is a certain fact, that young women,
who at fir&s;t had a copious effu&s;ion, have repeat|ed
this pretended &s;ymptom of virginity after a
few months ab&s;tinence. This phaenomenon
may, by proper management, be frequently ex|hibited,
e&s;pecially before the body has acquired
its full growth. It is equally certain, that young
women, who have not been faithful to the mar|riage-bed,
have, notwith&s;tanding, by the &s;imple
expedient of ab&s;tinence, given fre&s;h proofs of
innocence to their deluded hu&s;bands. Some
women, in the cour&s;e of two or three years, have
exhibited this fictitious mark of purity five times.
But this &s;ymptom is limited to a certain time;
for it &s;eldom appears after the age of eighteen
years. When the growth of the body is com|pleated,
its parts become fixed and unalterable,
and cannot a&s;&s;ume differences but by the em|ployment
of &s;uch artifices as it would be both
unnece&s;&s;ary and improper to relate. Be&s;ides,
many women, particularly tho&s;e who are irre|gular
in their men&s;es, and &s;ubject to the fluor
albus, never have any fre&s;h marks of virginity.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, can be more chimerical
than the prejudices of men with regard to vir|ginity,
and nothing can be more fallacious than
the pretended &s;igns of it. A young woman may
have commerce with a man before the age of
puberty, and yet exhibit no marks of virginity.
But the &s;ame woman, after &s;he arrives at puber|ty,
may have very copious effu&s;ions of blood.
<PB N="420" REF="433">
Others, who are actual virgins, di&s;cover no &s;uch
appearances. Men, therefore, &s;hould be per|fectly
ea&s;y as to this matter, and not indulge, as
is too often the ca&s;e, unju&s;t and ridiculous &s;u&s;|picions.</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to obtain an evident and infallible
mark of virginity, we mu&s;t &s;earch for it among
tho&s;e barbarous people, who are incapable of
in&s;tilling, by education, the &s;entiments of virtue
and honour into their children, but &s;ecure the
cha&s;tity of their daughters by an expedient which
could only be &s;ugge&s;ted by the rudene&s;s of their
manners. In Aethiopia, and other parts of Afri|ca,
in Pegu, Arabia Petrea, and other nations of
A&s;ia, the inhabitants, immediately after the birth
of females, &s;ew up tho&s;e parts which Nature has
&s;eparated, leaving only a &s;pace &s;ufficient for the
natural evacuations. As the child grows, the
parts gradually adhere, and, when the time of
marriage arrives, they are again di&s;united by in|ci&s;ion.
In&s;tead of thread, the fibres of the a&s;|be&s;tos
are &s;aid to be employed, which is a &s;ub|&s;tance
not liable to &s;udden corruption. Some
tribes content them&s;elves with putting a ring
through the parts. To this operation wives as
well as girls are &s;ubjected, with this difference,
that the ring allotted to the latter cannot be re|moved,
but in that allotted to the former, there
is a lock, of which the hu&s;band alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
the key. But why &s;hould we mention barba|rous
nations, when we have &s;imilar examples at
<PB N="421" REF="434">
no great di&s;tance? That ab&s;urd delicacy of a
neighbouring nation, with regard to the cha&s;tity
of their wives, is the offspring of a brutal and
criminal jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>How oppo&s;ite are the ta&s;tes, the di&s;po&s;itions,
the opinions, and the manners of different na|tions?
After what has been related concerning
the high e&s;timation of virginity among the bulk
of mankind, and the numberle&s;s precautions and
ignominious methods employed to &s;ecure it, is
it po&s;&s;ible to believe that there are other people
who de&s;pi&s;e virginity, and con&s;ider the trouble
of removing it to be a mean and &s;ervile office?</P>
<P>Super&s;tition has induced the inhabitants of
certain countries to re&s;ign the fir&s;t fruits of vir|ginity
to their idolatrous prie&s;ts, and &s;ometimes
to the idols them&s;elves. This privilege is enjoy|ed
by the prie&s;ts of Cochin and of Calicut; and,
in Goa, the virgins are pro&s;tituted by their pa|rents,
either voluntarily, or from choice, to an
idol of iron. Gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition makes the&s;e
people commit &s;uch abominable outrages, from
religious motives. But views more &s;ervile and
intere&s;ted have induced men of other countries to
devote their daughters to their chiefs. The in|habitants
of the Canary i&s;les, and of the king|dom
of Congo, pro&s;titute, in this manner, their
daughters, without any injury to their reputa|tion.
Nearly the &s;ame cu&s;tom takes place in
Turkey, Per&s;ia, and &s;everal other countries both
of A&s;ia and Africa. Their mo&s;t eminent nobles
<PB N="422" REF="435">
think them&s;elves highly honoured to receive
from their &s;overeign women with whom he him|&s;elf
is already di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Arracan, and in the Philip|pine
i&s;lands, a man would e&s;teem it to be di&s;|graceful
to marry a young woman who had not
been previou&s;ly deflowered; and nothing but
the force of money can prevail on any per&s;on to
precede the hu&s;band. In the province of Thi|bet,
mothers anxiou&s;ly &s;earch for &s;trangers, and
earne&s;tly &s;ollicit them to put their daughters in
a proper &s;tate for obtaining hu&s;bands. The
Laplanders likewi&s;e prefer girls who have had
commerce with &s;trangers. They fancy them to
po&s;&s;e&s;s uncommon merit, becau&s;e they have been
able to plea&s;e men who are better judges of beau|ty
and female accompli&s;hments than them&s;elves.
In Madaga&s;car, and &s;everal other countries, the
mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and debauched women are &s;oone&s;t
married. Many other examples might be given
of this &s;trange ta&s;te, which nothing but the
gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t depraved manners could pro|duce.</P>
<P>After puberty, marriage is the natural &s;tate
of man. A man ought to have but one wife,
and a woman but one hu&s;band. This is the
law of nature; for the number of females is
nearly equal to that of males. Such laws as
have been enacted in oppo&s;ition to this natural
principle, have originated &s;olely from tyranny
and ignorance. Rea&s;on, humanity, and ju&s;tice
<PB N="423" REF="436">
revolt again&s;t tho&s;e odious &s;eraglios, in which
the liberty and the affections of many women
are &s;acrificed to the brutal pa&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle
man. Does this unnatural pre-eminence render
the&s;e tyrants of the human race more happy?
No! Surrounded with eunuchs, and with wo|men,
u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves and to other men,
they are tormented with the con&s;tant appear|ance
of that accumulated load of mi&s;ery they
have created.</P>
<P>Marriage, therefore, as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed among
us, and other nations who are directed by the
lights of rea&s;on and revelation, is a &s;tate mo&s;t
con&s;onant to the nature of man, and in which
it is his duty to employ tho&s;e new faculties he
acquires from puberty. By ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t|ing
in celebacy, the&s;e powers become trouble|&s;ome,
and &s;ometimes fatal. In either &s;ex, too
long continency may give ri&s;e to di&s;ea&s;es, or
create irritations &s;o violent, that neither rea&s;on
nor religion will be able to counteract the im|petuo&s;ity
of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions they excite: And
thus man may be reduced to a level with the
brutes, which, under the influence of &s;uch &s;en&s;a|tions,
become perfectly furious and ungovern|able.</P>
<P>In women, the furor uterinus is the mo&s;t vi|olent
effect of this irritation. This di&s;ea&s;e is a
&s;pecies of madne&s;s, which deranges their ideas,
and deprives them of all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. Both
the nature and the &s;eat of this melancholy di&s;|temper
<PB N="424" REF="437">
are indicated by the mo&s;t la&s;civious ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
and the mo&s;t indelicate actions. I
have &s;een, with a&s;toni&s;hment, a girl at the age
of twelve years, who had a brown, but lively
and florid complexion, and, though low in &s;ta|ture,
was &s;trong and plump, commit the mo&s;t
indecent actions upon the very appearance of a
man, from which &s;he could not be deterred, ei|ther
by the pre&s;ence or cha&s;ti&s;ement of her mo|ther.
She did not, however, lo&s;e her rea&s;on;
and the paroxy&s;ms of the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;ed the mo|ment
&s;he was left with her own &s;ex. Ari&s;totle
alledges, that, at this age, the irritation is &s;trong|e&s;t,
and that girls ought then to be carefully
watched. The remark may be applicable to the
climate in which he lived; but, in colder coun|tries,
the ardor of the female con&s;titution does
not appear &s;o early.</P>
<P>When the furor uterinus increa&s;es to a certain
degree, marriage will not remove it; and there
have been in&s;tances of its proving fatal. Hap|pily
the force of nature is &s;eldom the only cau&s;e
of a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o dete&s;tible, even when there is a
predi&s;po&s;ition to it in the habit of body. Before
it arrives at this extremity, the imagination mu&s;t
be inflamed by licentious conver&s;ation, by ob|&s;cene
repre&s;entations, or other cau&s;es. Among
women, the oppo&s;ite temperament is infinitely
more common; for, with regard to this pa&s;&s;ion,
mo&s;t of them are either cool or indifferent.
There are al&s;o many men to whom cha&s;tity is
<PB N="425" REF="438">
an ea&s;y virtue. I have known &s;ome men who,
at the age of twenty-five or thirty, enjoyed good
health, without having ever felt this pa&s;&s;ion &s;o
&s;trong as to render any gratification nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Continency, however, is le&s;s to be dreaded
than exce&s;s. The number of immoderate men
is too great to require particular examples. By
exce&s;s, &s;ome have lo&s;t their memory; &s;ome have
been deprived of &s;ight; &s;ome have become bald;
and many have peri&s;hed by pure debility.
Young per&s;ons can never be &s;ufficiently warned
of the irreparable injury to their health, which
the indulgence of the venereal appetite never
fails to produce. How many cea&s;e to be men,
or, at lea&s;t, cea&s;e to enjoy the powers of manhood,
before the age of thirty? and how many, at
fifteen or eighteen, receive the &s;eeds of a di&s;ea&s;e,
di&s;graceful in it&s;elf, and which it is often impo&s;|&s;ible
to eradicate?</P>
<P>It has already been remarked, that, at the age
of puberty, the growth u&s;ually &s;tops. It fre|quently
happens, however, that, even after pu|berty,
a tedious illne&s;s makes the body increa&s;e
in length more than it would have done in a
&s;tate of perfect health. This extraordinary in|crea&s;e
is probably occa&s;ioned by the inactivity of
the external organs of generation during the
cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. The organic particles do
not reach the&s;e parts, becau&s;e they are not de|termined
thither by irritation; and this defect
of irritation is owing to a la&s;&s;itude and imbecil|lity
<PB N="426" REF="439">
of the parts, which prevent the &s;ecretion of
the &s;eminal fluid. The&s;e organic particles,
therefore, remain in the ma&s;s of blood, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily
extend the extremities of the bones,
nearly in the &s;ame manner as happens to eu|nuchs.
Thus young people, after recovering
from a long &s;ickne&s;s, are often taller, but wor&s;e
&s;haped, than formerly. Some, for in&s;tance, be|come
hunch-backed, and others crook-legged;
becau&s;e the &s;till ductile extremities of the bones
have been unnece&s;&s;arily extended by a &s;uperflui|ty
of organic particles, which, in a &s;tate of
health, would have been exhau&s;ted in the for|mation
of &s;eminal fluid.</P>
<P>The production of children is the chief inten|tion
of marriage. But this intention is &s;ome|times
fru&s;trated. Of the different cau&s;es of &s;te|rility,
&s;ome are common to both &s;exes. But, as
the&s;e cau&s;es are more apparent in men than in
women, they are, therefore, more commonly
a&s;cribed to the former. In both &s;exes, &s;terility
is occa&s;ioned either by a defect in the original
conformation, or by accidental injuries done to
the organs them&s;elves. In men, the mo&s;t per|nicious
defects of conformation are tho&s;e which
affect the te&s;ticles, or the mu&s;cles called <HI>erectores
penis.</HI> A wrong direction of the urethra, which
is &s;ometimes not only oblique, but improperly
perforated, is another ob&s;tacle to generation.
The adhe&s;ion of the prepuce to the fraenum is
another ob&s;tacle; but it is not in&s;urmountable.
<PB N="427" REF="440">
In women, the conformation of the uterus may
likewi&s;e occa&s;ion &s;terility. If the orifice of the
uterus be always open, or always &s;hut, concep|tion
will be equally prevented. But the mo&s;t
frequent cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s, both in men and
women, ari&s;es from &s;ome depravity in their &s;e|minal
fluids. I formerly quoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> remark of
Vali&s;nieri, that a corruption of the fluid in the
te&s;ticles of women rendered them entirely bar|ren.
It is the &s;ame with men. If the &s;ecretion
by which &s;emen is formed be vitiated, the fluid
is unfit for impregnation. The&s;e cau&s;es of &s;te|rility
are not di&s;coverable by any external ap|pearances.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of &s;terility, different means have been
employed to di&s;cover whether the defect pro|ceeded
from the man or the woman. In&s;pection
is the fir&s;t re&s;ource; and, if the barrenne&s;s be
occa&s;ioned by a fault in the external conforma|tion,
it is &s;ufficient. But, if the defect lie in the
internal organs, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible either to di&s;|cover
or remove it. Some men, though they
appear to be perfectly formed, want the genuine
&s;ign of a proper conformation. Others have
this &s;ign &s;o imperfectly, or &s;o &s;eldom, that it is
only a very equivocal mark of virility.</P>
<P>Every body knows that the action of this part
is not under the command of the mind. It is
the mo&s;t animal part of the human body; for
it acts by a kind of in&s;tinct, the cau&s;es of which
are unknown. How many young per&s;ons, e|ducated
<PB N="428" REF="441">
in perfect purity, and totally ignorant
of plea&s;ure, have felt the mo&s;t lively impre&s;|&s;ions,
without being able to recogni&s;e either their
cau&s;e, or their object? How many, on the con|trary,
remain cold and languid, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the efforts of &s;en&s;e and imagination?</P>
<P>This part of our bodies, therefore, belongs
le&s;s to us than any other of our members. It
acts or is languid without our participation.
Its functions commence or terminate at certain
periods. All this happens without our com|mand,
and often contrary to our inclination.</P>
<P>Where, then, is the foundation for tho&s;e laws,
which are &s;o unju&s;t in their principle, and &s;o
di&s;graceful in their execution? The rules and
decrees of the Congr&eacute;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of an infamous court in France, where trials for impotency, with a view to di&s;&s;olve marriages, were held. Proofs by in&s;pection were taken before the judge, who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;urgeons and midwives. This court was aboli&s;hed by an arret of the parliament of Paris, dated 18th February 1677. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that the Count de Buffon, who expre&s;&s;es the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation again&s;t this court, &s;hould have mentioned nothing of its di&s;&s;olution.</NOTE> are an affront to hu|man
rea&s;on. Its members &s;hould have known,
that the very means they employed to inve&s;ti|gate
truth, were not only indelicate, but infal|libly
prevented its di&s;covery.</P>
<P>When there is no defect in the external con|formation,
barrenne&s;s proceeds oftener from
the woman than the man; for, independent of
the pernicious effects of the fluor albus, there
<PB N="429" REF="442">
&s;eems to be another cau&s;e which has never ex|cited
attention.</P>
<P>From my experiments, related in the &s;ixth
chapter, it appears that the te&s;ticles of females
give birth to a kind of natural protuberances,
which I have called <HI>glandular bodies.</HI> They
grow in a gradual manner, and &s;erve for &s;ecre|ting
and maturating the &s;eminal fluid. They
are in a continual fluctuating &s;tate. They be|gin
to grow under the membrane of the te&s;ticle,
which they &s;oon perforate; they then &s;well,
and their extremities &s;pontaneou&s;ly open, and
di&s;till a &s;eminal fluid for &s;ome time; after which
they gradually decay, leaving only a &s;mall red|di&s;h
cicatrice on the place from whence they
&s;prung. The&s;e glandular bodies no &s;ooner di&s;|appear
than they are replaced by others; &s;o that
the te&s;ticles are continually labouring, and un|dergoing
con&s;iderable changes. Hence any de|rangement
in the&s;e organs, either by an unu&s;ual
thickne&s;s of the fluid, or weakne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els,
prevents the proper exerci&s;e of their functions,
renders them unable to &s;ecrete, or rather vitiates
and corrupts the &s;eminal fluid, which nece&s;&s;arily
gives ri&s;e to &s;terility.</P>
<P>Conception &s;ometimes precedes puberty. Many
women have become mothers before the appear|ance
of the men&s;es; and &s;ome, who never had
any &s;ymptoms of this evacuation, are in the
habit of bearing children. In&s;tances of this
kind happen in our climate, without travelling
<PB N="430" REF="443">
for them to Brazil, where whole nations are
&s;aid to be perpetuated, though not a &s;ingle wo|man
be &s;ubject to the men&s;trual di&s;charge; an
evident proof that it is not the men&s;trual blood,
but the &s;eminal fluid of the male and female,
which are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to generation. It
is likewi&s;e known, that the ce&s;&s;ation of the
men&s;es, which generally happens about the age
of forty or fifty years, does not di&s;qualify every
woman for conception; for &s;ome women have
become pregnant at &s;ixty or &s;eventy, and even
at an age &s;till more advanced. The&s;e examples,
though pretty frequent, may be regarded as ex|ceptions
to the general rule; but they are &s;uffi|cient
to demon&s;trate that the men&s;trual blood is
by no means e&s;&s;ential to generation.</P>
<P>In the ordinary cour&s;e of Nature, women
conceive not before the men&s;es appear, nor af|ter
they have cea&s;ed. The age at which men
fir&s;t acquire the faculty of generating is not &s;o
di&s;tinctly marked. His body mu&s;t attain a cer|tain
growth before &s;emen is &s;ecreted; and, be|fore
this fluid be fully maturated, the degree
of growth mu&s;t be &s;till greater. This generally
happens between the twelfth and eighteenth
years. But the period when man lo&s;es the ge|nerative
faculty, Nature &s;eems to have left un|determined.
At &s;ixty or &s;eventy, when old age
begins to enervate the body, the &s;emen is le&s;s
abundant, and often unprolific. In the collec|tions
of public &s;ocieties, however, there are
<PB N="431" REF="444">
many in&s;tances of men who have continued to
procreate at the age of eighty and ninety.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e examples of boys who
have propagated at eight, nine, and ten years,
and of girls who have conceived at &s;even, eight,
and nine years. But &s;uch facts are exceedingly
rare, and ought to be regarded as &s;ingular phae|nomena.
The &s;ign of virility appears in in|fancy:
But that is not &s;ufficient; the produc|tion
of &s;emen mu&s;t be added; and this happens
not till the growth of the body be nearly com|pleated.
At fir&s;t the quantity is &s;mall, and ge|nerally
&s;terile.</P>
<P>Two marks of conception have been men|tioned
by authors. The fir&s;t is a kind of tre|mor,
or &s;hivering, which is &s;aid to begin at the
moment of conception, and continues for &s;ome
days. The &s;econd is derived from the orifice
of the uterus, which, it is a&s;&s;erted, clo&s;es entirely
after conception. But the&s;e &s;igns appear to be
very equivocal, if not altogether imaginary.</P>
<P>This tremor is mentioned by Hippocrates in
the following terms: 'Liquido con&s;tat harum
rerum peritis, quod mulier, ubi concepit, &s;ta|tim
inhorre&s;cit ac dentibus &s;tridet, et auricu|lum
reliquumque corpus convul&s;io prehendit.'
Galen, on the authority of &s;ome women, im|putes
this &s;ymptom to a contraction of the ute|rus.
Others expre&s;s it by a vague &s;en&s;ation of
cold over the whole body, and employ the words
<HI>horror</HI> and <HI>horripilatio.</HI> The&s;e, and other au|thors,
<PB N="432" REF="445">
endeavour, like Galen, to e&s;tabli&s;h the
fact upon the te&s;timony of women. Hippocra|tes
&s;ays, 'quae in utero gerunt, harum os uteri
clau&s;um e&s;t;' or, according to another tran&s;la|tor,
'quaecunque &s;unt gravidae, illis os uteri
connivet.' Opinions, however, are various as
to the changes which the uterus undergoes after
conception. Some maintain, that the edges of
the <HI>os tincae</HI> are drawn &s;o clo&s;e together, that no
vacuity is left between them; and others affirm,
that the&s;e edges are not exactly clo&s;e till after
the two fir&s;t months of pregnancy. They agree,
however, that, immediately after conception, the
orifice is &s;hut up by a glutinous humour; that
the os tincae, which, previous to conception,
might admit a &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;ize of a pea,
has no perceptible aperture; and that this dif|ference
is &s;o evident, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hable by
a &s;kilful midwife. If the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were
founded in truth, the &s;tate of pregnancy might
be known a few days after conception.</P>
<P>It is urged, on the other hand, that if, after
conception, the orifice of the uterus were clo&s;ed,
&s;uperfoctation would be impo&s;&s;ible. To this it
may be replied, that the &s;eminal liquor may per|haps
penetrate through the membranes of the
uterus; that the uterus it&s;elf may open to
receive the materials nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uperfoeta|tion;
and that, at any rate, &s;uperfoetations &s;o
&s;eldom happen, that they make a very trifling
exception to the general rule. Other authors
<PB N="433" REF="446">
maintain, that this change in the uterus can ne|ver
appear but in women who have formerly
conceived and brought forth children. In fir&s;t
conceptions, indeed, the difference mu&s;t be le&s;s
perceptible; but, though ever &s;o con&s;picuous,
we have not &s;ufficient evidence to conclude, that
it is a certain, a uniform, and a po&s;itive &s;ign. The
&s;tudy of anatomy, aided by experience, affords,
on this &s;ubject, general notions only, which va|ni&s;h
upon a clo&s;er examination. The &s;ame ob|&s;ervation
may be applied to the &s;hivering, or
convul&s;ive cold, which &s;ome women are &s;aid to
feel at the time of conception. As mo&s;t women
experience not this &s;en&s;ation; as others, on the
contrary, a&s;&s;ure us, that they have felt a burn|ing
heat; and as others &s;till confe&s;s that they are
utter &s;trangers to all &s;uch feelings; the natural
conclu&s;ion is, that all the&s;e marks are highly e|quivocal,
and that, when they do happen, they
ought to be con&s;idered, not as the effects of con|ception,
but of other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject I &s;hall add one fact from Mr
Par&s;ons's lectures on mu&s;cular motion, p. 79.
which proves, that the orifice of the uterus does
not clo&s;e immediately after conception, or, if
it does clo&s;e, that the &s;emen may find a pa&s;&s;age
into the uterus, by penetrating through its &s;ub|&s;tance.
In the year 1714, a woman of Charles|&s;town
in South Carolina, was delivered of two
children, the one immediately after the other.
<PB N="434" REF="447">
To the a&s;toni&s;hment of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, the one
child was black and the other white. This e|vident
te&s;timony of the woman's infidelity to her
hu&s;band, obliged her to acknowledge, that, one
morning, her hu&s;band having ju&s;t left her bed, a
negro entered her chamber, and, by threats of im|mediate
death, compelled her to gratify his de&s;ires.
This fact &s;hows, that the conception of two or
more children does not always happen at one
time, and &s;upports my opinion, that the &s;emen
penetrates through the texture of the uterus.</P>
<P>There are many other equivocal &s;igns of preg|nancy,
by which it is &s;aid to be early di&s;tin|gui&s;hable;
as a &s;light pain in the region of the
uterus and loins; a numbne&s;s over the whole
body; a continual drow&s;ine&s;s; a melancholy
and capricious di&s;po&s;ition; the toothache, head|ache;
and a vertigo, which ob&s;cures the &s;ight;
yellowi&s;h, blood-&s;hot eyes, with contracted pu|pils
and depre&s;&s;ed eye-lids; a pale and &s;potted
countenance; a depraved appetite, accompanied
with vomiting and &s;pitting; hy&s;teric &s;ymptoms;
the fluor albus; the &s;toppage of the men&s;trual
di&s;charge, or, in&s;tead of it, an haemorrhage; the
&s;ecretion of milk in the brea&s;ts, &amp;c. Many o|ther
marks &s;uppo&s;ed to be peculiar to pregnan|cy,
might be added; but they are frequently
nothing more than the effects of particular
di&s;ea&s;es. But we &s;hall leave the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e to phy&s;icians; details of this kind, to be
<PB N="435" REF="448">
u&s;eful, would require a long &s;eries of profound
inve&s;tigation. This &s;ubject, like many others in
phy&s;iology, the animal oeconomy, and different
branches of the medical art, has &s;eldom been
treated with any degree of philo&s;ophical ac|curacy.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Manhood.</HEAD>
<P>AT the age of puberty, or a few years after
it, the human body attains its full &s;ta|ture.
The growth of &s;ome per&s;ons &s;tops at the
fourteenth or fifteenth year; and, in others, it
continues till they arrive at twenty-two or
twenty-three years. During this period, mo&s;t
men are of a &s;lender make: Their thighs and
legs are &s;mall, and the mu&s;cular parts are not
properly filled up. But, by degrees, the mu&s;|cles
&s;well, the limbs and different parts of the
body a&s;&s;ume their proper figure and proportions,
and, before the age of thirty, the body, in men,
acquires its mo&s;t perfect &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>But, in women, the body &s;ooner attains this
&s;ymmetry. As their &s;ize is &s;maller, and their
mu&s;cles, and other parts, le&s;s &s;trong, compact,
and &s;olid, than tho&s;e of men, they arrive more
early at a &s;tate of maturity. A woman at twenty
years is as perfectly formed as a man at thirty.</P>
<P>The body of a well-&s;haped man ought to be
&s;quare, the mu&s;cles boldly marked, and the fea|tures
of the face di&s;tinctly defined. In women,
the parts are rounder and &s;ofter, and their features
<PB N="437" REF="450">
are more delicate. Man is adorned with &s;trength
and maje&s;ty; grace and &s;oftne&s;s are the peculiar
embelli&s;hments of woman.</P>
<P>Even the external figure of the human &s;pecies
declares them to be the &s;overeigns of the earth.
The body of man is erect; his attitude is that
of command; and his countenance, which is
turned towards the heavens, is impre&s;&s;ed with
the &s;ignatures of &s;uperior dignity. The image
of his &s;oul is painted in his face; the excellence
of his nature penetrates through his material
form, and animates his features with a divine
illumination. His maje&s;tic deportment, and the
firmne&s;s of his movements, announce the &s;upe|riority
of his rank. He touches the earth but
with his extremity: He views it only at a di|&s;tance,
and &s;eems to de&s;pi&s;e it. His arms are
not pillars to &s;upport his body: His hands tread
not the earth, and lo&s;e not, by friction and pre&s;|&s;ure,
that delicacy of feeling for which they
were originally de&s;tined. His arms and hands
are formed for purpo&s;es more noble, namely,
for executing the commands of his intellect, for
laying hold of di&s;tant objects, for removing ob|&s;tacles,
for defending him from injuries, and for
&s;eizing and retaining objects of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the mind is at ea&s;e, all the features of
the countenance are in a &s;tate of profound tran|quility.
Their proportion, their harmony, their
union, point out &s;erenity of &s;entiment, and ac|cord
with the calm that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts within. When
<PB N="438" REF="451">
the &s;oul, however, is agitated, the human vi&s;age
becomes a living canvas, upon which pa&s;&s;ions are
repre&s;ented with equal energy and delicacy;
where every emotion is expre&s;&s;ed by a corre|&s;pondent
feature; where every impre&s;&s;ion anti|cipates
the will, and reveals, by obvious and pa|thetic
characters, tho&s;e intentions and feelings
which we are &s;ollicitous to conceal.</P>
<P>It is in the eyes that the pa&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t
&s;trongly marked, and mo&s;t readily di&s;covered.
The eye belongs to the &s;oul more than any o|ther
bodily organ. It participates of every
mental emotion, the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t tender,
as well as the mo&s;t violent and tumultuous.
It exhibits the&s;e emotions in all their force and
purity, and infu&s;es into the &s;oul of the &s;pectator
the fire and the agitation of that mind in which
they originate. In fine, the eye reflects the
light of thought, and the glow of &s;entiment;
it is the &s;en&s;e of the under&s;tanding, and the lan|guage
of intelligence.</P>
<P>Men who &s;quint, or are &s;hort-&s;ighted, have
le&s;s of this external &s;oul, (as it may be termed),
who&s;e chief re&s;idence is in the eye. The&s;e de|fects
hurt the phy&s;iognomy, and give to the fine&s;t
countenance a di&s;agreeable, and often a &s;tupid
air. As nothing but &s;trong and violent pa&s;&s;ions
are di&s;coverable in vi&s;ages of this kind, and as
they exhibit no marks of delicacy or vivacity of
&s;entiment, we are apt to form unfavourable
impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch per&s;ons, which, however
<PB N="439" REF="452">
ill-founded, it is difficult for us to efface. We
are &s;o accu&s;tomed to be influenced by external
appearances, that, if no &s;ymptoms of thought
and reflection appear in a man's countenance,
we in&s;tantly decide him to be void of abili|ty.
We even draw conclu&s;ions from the cut
of the cloaths, or a curl of the periwig; nei|ther
are the&s;e conclu&s;ions always fal&s;e. Men
ought, therefore, to pay &s;ome attention to the&s;e
minute articles; becau&s;e, in the eye of &s;trangers,
they make a part of our&s;elves, and contribute
not a little to the judgments they form of our
under&s;tanding and breeding.</P>
<P>A vivacious or a languid motion of the eye
has a prodigious effect on the character of the
countenance. Eyes are of different colours, dark
hazel, light hazel, green, blue, gray, and whi|ti&s;h
gray. The iris has a &s;mooth velvet-like
appearance, and con&s;i&s;ts of many &s;mall filaments,
regularly di&s;po&s;ed, and directed towards the
centre of the pupil. The mo&s;t u&s;ual colours of
the eye are the hazel and the blue; and both
the&s;e colours are &s;ometimes to be found in the
&s;ame eye. The eyes commonly called black,
when narrowly in&s;pected, are only of a dark
hazel colour. They appear black in con&s;e|quence
of their being contra&s;ted with the white
of the eye. Tho&s;e of a le&s;s deep hazel are like|wi&s;e
reckoned black, but are not equally beauti|ful.
Shades of orange, hazel, gray, and blue
are frequently to be met with in the &s;ame eye;
<PB N="440" REF="453">
but, wherever there is a blue tint, it becomes the
prevailing colour, and out&s;hines all the re&s;t.
The black and the blue are the mo&s;t beautiful
colours, and give mo&s;t fire and vivacity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion
to the eye. In black eyes, there is
more force and impetuo&s;ity; but the blue ex|cel
in &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy. The former
dart forth a perpetual and uniform flame, be|cau&s;e
their colour appears always the &s;ame, and
reflects the &s;ame rays: But the modifications of
light are di&s;tingui&s;hable in the blue; becau&s;e
different rays are reflected by the various tints
of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and other varieties in the colours of the
eyes, are peculiar to man, the hor&s;e, &amp;c. In
mo&s;t other animals, the colours of individuals
vary not. The eyes of the ox are brown; tho&s;e
of the &s;heep are of a watry colour; tho&s;e of the
goat are gray, &amp;c. Ari&s;totle alledges, that, among
men, gray eyes are the &s;tronge&s;t; that the blue
are weaker; that prominent eyes are &s;hort-&s;ight|ed;
and that brown eyes &s;ee not &s;o well as o|thers,
in a faint light.</P>
<P>Though the eye, in moving, &s;eems to be
drawn towards either &s;ide, yet it only moves
round its own centre, which gives the pupil
the appearance of approaching or receding from
the angles of the orbit, and of being elevated or
depre&s;&s;ed. In man the eyes are nearer each o|ther
than in any other animal. In &s;ome &s;pecies,
the eyes are &s;o remotely &s;ituated, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="441" REF="454">
for both eyes to &s;ee the &s;ame object at
the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Next to the eyes, the parts which give mo&s;t
character to the countenance are the eye-brows.
Being totally different from every other feature,
their effect is augmented by the contra&s;t: They
form a deep &s;hade in the canvas, and give relief
to the other colours and features. The la&s;hes of
the eye-lid have al&s;o their effect; when long
and bu&s;hy, they be&s;tow beauty on the eye, and
give a mild and plea&s;ant a&s;pect to the face.
La&s;hes on both eye-lids are peculiar to man and
the ape. Other animals have hair on the upper
lid only; and, even in man, the la&s;h of the under
lid is le&s;s than that of the upper. The eye|brows
have only two movements; one by which
they are elevated; and the other by which they
are depre&s;&s;ed and contracted.</P>
<P>The eye-lids guard the ball of the eye from
du&s;t, in&s;ects, &amp;c. and keep the cornea moi&s;t.
The upper eye-lid moves up and down; but
the under lid has little or no motion. Although
the motion of the eye-lids be &s;ubject to the will,
yet, by &s;leep, fatigue, or &s;urpri&s;e, we lo&s;e the
command of them. They are &s;ometimes al&s;o
affected with convul&s;ive motions, which we are
unable to re&s;train. In birds, and amphibious
quadrupeds, the under eye-lid alone moves;
and fi&s;hes and in&s;ects have no eye-lids either a|bove
or below.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="455">
The fore-head occupies a large part of the
&s;ace, and contributes greatly to its beauty. It
&s;hould be well proportioned, neither too flat nor
too prominent; neither too narrow, nor too
&s;hort; and it &s;hould be regularly adorned with
hair both above and on each &s;ide. The hair
gives great expre&s;&s;ion to the countenance; bald|ne&s;s
is therefore a capital defect; and the prac|tice
of employing artificial hair, which is now &s;o
general, ought to be confined to &s;uch as are na|turally
bald; for borrowed locks often change
the true character of the face. If every man
wore his own hair, and allowed it to float free|ly,
it would be more ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h cha|racters
by the general a&s;pect of the countenance.
The crown of the head, and immediately a|bove
the temples, are the parts which fir&s;t be|come
bald; but the hair below the temples, and
on the under part of the back of the head, &s;eldom
falls off. Baldne&s;s is peculiar to man: Women,
in the mo&s;t advanced age, though their hair be|comes
white, are &s;eldom affected with it: Chil|dren
and eunuchs are not more &s;ubject to bald|ne&s;s
than women; and the hair is &s;tronger and
more abundant in youth than at any other pe|riod.
The longe&s;t hair becomes dry, and gra|dually
wa&s;tes and falls off as we advance in life.
The whitene&s;s commences at the points; and
when the hair is totally white, it lo&s;es its
&s;trength, and at la&s;t falls off altogether. There
have been examples of young people who&s;e hair
<PB N="443" REF="456">
was rendered white by di&s;ea&s;e, and which reco|vered
its natural colour after their health was
re&s;tored. It is alledged by Ari&s;totle, that no
man becomes bald before having intercour&s;e
with women, excepting &s;uch as have been bald
from their birth. The antient writers upbraid
the inhabitants of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago
with the epithet <HI>bald-heads</HI>; and a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e
i&s;landers are all brought into the world with this
defect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dapper's, Voyage, p. 354. and Plin. edit. Hardouin, p. 541.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The no&s;e is the mo&s;t prominent feature in the
face. But, as it has very little motion, even in
the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions, it contributes more to
the beauty than to the expre&s;&s;ion of the coun|tenance;
and, unle&s;s it be deformed, or greatly
di&s;proportioned, it is le&s;s attended to than tho&s;e
features which are capable of motion, as the
mouth and the eyes. The form of the no&s;e, and
its remarkable prominency, are peculiar to the
human &s;pecies. Mo&s;t animals have no&s;trils &s;e|parated
by a partition; but none of them have
an elevated and advanced no&s;e. Even the apes
may be &s;aid to have only no&s;trils; the no&s;e of
an ape has the &s;ame po&s;ition as that of a man;
but it is &s;o &s;hort and flat, that it can hardly be
regarded as &s;imilar. By this organ, men, and
mo&s;t animals, breathe, and &s;mell odoriferous bo|dies.
Birds have no cartilaginous no&s;trils; they
have only two holes or pipes for the purpo&s;es of
re&s;piration and &s;melling.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="457">
Next to the eyes, the mouth and lips have
both the greate&s;t motion and expre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e
motions are excited by the pa&s;&s;ions, and the vari|ous
forms of the mouth mark their different cha|racters
and modifications. The organs of &s;peech
give the mouth an animation &s;uperior to every o|ther
part of the face. The vermilion of the lips,
and the whitene&s;s of the teeth, &s;o much excel
the other colours of the face, that they attract
our chief regard. We fix our eyes on the mouth
of the &s;peaker; every word, every articulation,
produces different motions in the lips; and, how|ever
rapid, it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h them from
each other. The deaf learn to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e
motions &s;o accurately, that they often know the
&s;entiments of the &s;peaker merely by attending
to the motions of his lips.</P>
<P>In man, and in all other animals, the under|jaw
alone is endowed with the power of motion.
The crocodile, the opinion of Ari&s;totle and many
other naturali&s;ts notwith&s;tanding, is not an ex|ception:
I have examined many &s;keletons of
that animal, and have found, by the nature of
the articulation, that the under-jaw alone was
moveable. In the human foetus, and in
monkeys, the under-jaw is greatly advanced be|fore
the upper. The deformity, in adults, is
equal, whether the under-jaw be too prominent,
or too much depre&s;&s;ed: It ought to be nearly
on a level with the upper. Strong pa&s;&s;ions, as
well as languor, often produce an involuntary
<PB N="445" REF="458">
motion in the under-jaw: Pain and plea&s;ure, as
well as languor, give ri&s;e to yawning; but, in
the former, the motion is more bri&s;k and lively.</P>
<P>When the mind is &s;uddenly affected with ar|dent
de&s;ire, or keen regret, we feel a &s;ort of
&s;tarting, or internal oppre&s;&s;ion; this motion of
the diaphragm elevates the lungs, and produces
that &s;udden in&s;piration which forms a &s;igh:
And, when the mind con&s;iders the cau&s;e of its
emotion, and perceives no method of accom|pli&s;hing
its de&s;ire, or of bani&s;hing its regret, the
&s;ighs are repeated, and &s;orrow, or mental pain,
&s;ucceeds. If this pain of mind be great and un|expected,
it produces tears; the air ru&s;hes quick|ly
into the lungs, and gives ri&s;e to many in&s;pi|rations,
which are accompanied with involuntary
&s;hocks: Each in&s;piration makes a noi&s;e &s;trong|er
than that of &s;ighing, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the name of &s;obbing; the&s;e &s;obs &s;ucceed each
other more rapidly than &s;ighs; and, in the for|mer,
the &s;ound of the voice is more apparent.
The accent of the voice is &s;till more di&s;tingui&s;h|able
in groaning, which is a &s;pecies of &s;ob
long continued: and its &s;low &s;ound is heard both
in expiration and in&s;piration: Its expre&s;&s;ion con|&s;i&s;ts
in the continuation of a plaintiff tone form|ed
by inarticulate &s;ounds. Groans are &s;horter
or longer according to the degree of &s;orrow or
dejection; but they are generally repeated &s;e|veral
times. The time of in&s;piration forms the
interval that takes place between each groan;
<PB N="446" REF="459">
and the intervals are nearly equal both in their
duration and their di&s;tance. The plaintiff &s;hriek
is a groan expre&s;&s;ed with force, and with a high
tone of voice. The &s;hriek, when very &s;harp,
generally continues on the &s;ame tone through
its whole extent; but, when moderate, it gene|rally
ends in a lower tone.</P>
<P>Laughter is an interrupted &s;ound, often re|peated,
and accompanied with a kind of con|vul&s;ive
motion of the belly, which is alternately
elevated and depre&s;&s;ed. To facilitate this mo|tion,
the brea&s;t and head are &s;ometimes thrown
forward; the che&s;t remains immoveable; the
angles of the mouth recede from each other;
and the cheeks &s;well: Every time that the belly
is depre&s;&s;ed, the air bur&s;ts from the mouth, and
occa&s;ions a noi&s;e, which, during the fit, is often
repeated, &s;ometimes on the &s;ame tone, and &s;ome|times
the tones gradually dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>The lips, in immoderate laughter, and in mo&s;t
violent pa&s;&s;ions, open wide; but, in the more
tranquil emotions, the angles of the mouth re|cede,
without any opening of the lips, the
cheeks &s;well, and, in &s;ome per&s;ons, dimples are
formed in them near the corners of the mouth:
This charm belongs to the graces, and is com|monly
attended with an agreeable &s;mile, which
is a mark of benevolence, and of internal &s;ati&s;|faction:
A &s;mile is al&s;o a mode of expre&s;&s;ing
contempt and ridicule; but, in the&s;e malignant
&s;miles, we pre&s;s the lips clo&s;e to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="460">
The cheeks are uniform features, and have
little motion or expre&s;&s;ion, excepting from that
involuntary redne&s;s or palene&s;s with which they
are covered in different pa&s;&s;ions; they unite
the features, and give a contour to the face; they
contribute more to beauty than to expre&s;&s;ion;
and the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be applied to the
chin, the ears, and the temples.</P>
<P>Shame, anger, pride, joy, equally give ri&s;e to
blu&s;hing; while fear, terror, and &s;orrow, pro|duce
a palene&s;s in the face. This change of
colour is involuntary; it exhibits the &s;tate of
the mind without its con&s;ent. It is an effect of
&s;entiment over which the will has no command.
We can ea&s;ily di&s;gui&s;e the other marks of pa&s;|&s;ion;
for a moment's reflection enables us to
&s;top the action of the mu&s;cles of the face which
characteri&s;e particular pa&s;&s;ions, and even to
change their direction; but to &s;top or alter the
redne&s;s or palene&s;s of the countenance, is be|yond
our power; becau&s;e the&s;e depend on a
peculiar motion of the blood, occa&s;ioned by the
action of the diaphragm, which is the chief in|ternal
organ of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>In different pa&s;&s;ions, the whole head is affected
with different motions and po&s;itions: It hangs
forward during &s;hame, humility, and &s;orrow;
it inclines to one &s;ide in languor and compa&s;|&s;ion;
it is elevated in pride, erect and fixed in
ob&s;tinacy and &s;elf-conceit; it is thrown back|ward
in a&s;toni&s;hment or &s;urpri&s;e; and rolls from
<PB N="448" REF="461">
&s;ide to &s;ide in contempt, ridicule, and indigna|tion.</P>
<P>Grief, joy, love, &s;hame, and compa&s;&s;ion,
make the eyes &s;well, and cau&s;e the tears to
flow. The effu&s;ion of tears is always accompa|nied
with a contraction of the mu&s;cles of the
face, which opens the mouth; the tears flow
through the lachrymal ducts into the no&s;e, and
increa&s;e the fluid with which it is naturally
moi&s;tened: The flowing of the tears is not con|&s;tant;
they &s;eem to bur&s;t out at irregular inter|vals.</P>
<P>In grief, the corners of the mouth are de|pre&s;&s;ed,
the under-lip ri&s;es, the eye-lids fall
down, the pupil is elevated, and half concealed
under the eye-lid: The other mu&s;cles of the
face are relaxed, which enlarges the &s;pace be|tween
the mouth and the eyes; and, of cour&s;e,
the countenance appears to be &s;tretched out
beyond its ordinary length. (See plate VIII.
fig. 1.).</P>
<P>In con&s;ternation and terror, the brow is wrink|led,
the eye-brows are elevated, the upper eye|lid
opens &s;o wide that it ri&s;es above the pupil,
and uncovers a part of the white above the pu|pil,
which la&s;t falls down, and is partly concealed
by the under-lid. The mouth, at the &s;ame
time, opens wide, the lips recede from each
other, and expo&s;e the teeth both above and be|low.
(See plate VIII. fig. 2.).</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="462">
In contempt and deri&s;ion, one corner of the
upper-lip ri&s;es, and leaves the teeth bare; the
other corner moves a little, and has the appear|ance
of a malignant &s;mile; the no&s;tril next the
elevated &s;ide of the lip &s;hrivels up, and the angle
of the mouth falls down. The eye, on the &s;ame
&s;ide, is almo&s;t &s;hut, while the other remains o|pen;
and both pupils are depre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame
manner as when a per&s;on looks down from a
height. (See plate VIII. fig. 3.)</P>
<P>In jealou&s;y, envy, and malice, the eye-brows
fall down and are wrinkled; the eye-lids ri&s;e,
and the pupils fall down; the upper lip is ele|vated
on both &s;ides; the angles of the mouth
&s;ink a little, and the middle of the under-lip
ri&s;es and joins the middle of the upper one.
(See plate VIII. fig. 4.)</P>
<P>In laughing, the angles of the mouth are
drawn back, and &s;omewhat elevated; the upper
part of the cheeks ri&s;e; the eyes are more or
le&s;s &s;hut; the upper lip ri&s;es and the under one
&s;inks; the mouth opens; and, when the laugh|ter
is immoderate, the &s;kin of the no&s;e wrinkles.
(See plate VIII. fig. 5.)</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e marks, the arms, the hands, and
the whole body contribute to the expre&s;&s;ion of
the pa&s;&s;ions. Ge&s;ture al&s;o concurs with the ac|tion
of the features in expre&s;&s;ing the different
emotions of the &s;oul. In joy, for example, the
eyes, the head, the arms, and whole body, are
agitated with quick and various movements. In
<PB N="450" REF="463">
languor and grief, the eyes are &s;unk, the head
reclines, the arms hang down, and the whole
body remains fixed and immoveable. In admi|ration,
&s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;toni&s;hment, every motion
is &s;u&s;pended, and the per&s;on remains in the &s;ame
uniform attitude. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;|&s;ions
are involuntary: But there is another &s;pe|cies
of expre&s;&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ts in an agitation
of the eyes, head, arms, and body; and the&s;e
motions &s;eem, at the &s;ame time, to be the effect
of reflection, and to depend on the will. They
appear to be efforts of the mind to defend the
body, and may be regarded as &s;econdary &s;ymp|toms,
by which particular pa&s;&s;ions may be di|&s;tingui&s;hed.
In love, hope, and keen de&s;ire, we
elevate the head, and turn towards heaven, as if
imploring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; we &s;tretch forward the
head to make a nearer approach; and we ex|tend
the arms and open the hands, in order to
&s;eize and embrace the beloved object. On the
other hand, in fear, hatred, and horror, we pu&s;h
the arms forward with precipitation, to repel the
object of our aver&s;ion; we turn back the head
and the eyes; we recoil, and at la&s;t fly, in or|der
to avoid it. The&s;e motions are &s;o &s;udden,
that they appear to be involuntary: But this de|ception
is the effect of habit; for the&s;e motions
are produced by reflection, and, by their alacri|ty,
di&s;cover the perfection of tho&s;e qualities of
the body which enable it to obey, with &s;uch a|mazing
promptitude, the commands of the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="464">
As the pa&s;&s;ions are agitations or movements
of the mind, for the mo&s;t part connected with
impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;ation, they may be expre&s;&s;ed
by motions of the body, and particularly by tho&s;e
of the countenance. We can, therefore, form a
judgment of the affections of the mind by the
motions of the body, and can di&s;cover the real
&s;ituation of the &s;oul by examining the changes
in the features of the face. But, as the mind
has no figure which can have any relation to
that of matter, we can form no judgment of the
general di&s;po&s;ition of any mind by the features
of the countenance, or by the figure of the body
with which it is connected. A deformed body
may contain an amiable mind; neither &s;hould
we pronounce concerning the natural di&s;po&s;ition
of any per&s;on, merely becau&s;e the features of
his countenance are not agreeable; for there is
no analogy between features and the nature of
the &s;oul, upon which any rea&s;onable conjectures
can be founded.</P>
<P>The antients, however, were much addicted
to this fal&s;e notion; and there have not been
wanting, in every age, men who wi&s;hed to &s;up|port
a &s;cientific divination derived from a pre|tended
&s;kill in phy&s;iognomy. But nothing is
more evident, than that this &s;pecies of divina|tion
can be extended no farther than to the af|fections
of the mind, when expre&s;&s;ed by the mo|tion
of the eyes, vi&s;age, and other parts of the
body: The form of the no&s;e, of the mouth,
<PB N="452" REF="465">
and of other features, has no more connection
with the natural di&s;po&s;ition of any per&s;on, than
the &s;tature, or &s;ize of the limbs, with the faculty
of thinking. Has a man more genius in pro|portion
as his no&s;e is well made? Is the ability
of another more circum&s;cribed, becau&s;e his eyes
are &s;mall and his mouth large? If mu&s;t, there|fore,
be acknowledged, that the divination of
phy&s;iognomi&s;ts is altogether chimerical, and de|&s;titute
of any foundation in nature.</P>
<P>The ears, of all the parts of the head, contri|bute
lea&s;t to the expre&s;&s;ion of the face. They
are placed at a &s;ide, and commonly concealed
under the hair. But, in quadrupeds, the ears
are more apparent; and by them we can di&s;co|ver
whether the creatures be in a &s;tate of vigour
or of imbecillity; their motions denote &s;entiment,
and corre&s;pond to the internal feelings of the
animal. The human ears, though furni&s;hed
with mu&s;cles, have hardly any motion, either
voluntary or involuntary. Small ears are &s;aid
to be mo&s;t beautiful; but large ones are better
calculated for hearing. Some nations greatly en|large
the lobes of their ears, by piercing them, and
placing in them pieces of wood or metal, which
they change &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for others of greater
dimen&s;ions, till the holes become enormous;
and the lobes uniformly increa&s;e in proportion
to the &s;ize of the holes. I have &s;een the&s;e round
pieces of wood, which had been brought from
India or South America, of more than an inch
<PB N="453" REF="466">
and a half in diameter. It is difficult to inve&s;ti|gate
the origin of this &s;ingular cu&s;tom; but it
is equally difficult to trace the origin of piercing
the ears, (a practice almo&s;t general), and &s;ome|times
the no&s;trils, in order to adorn them with
rings, &amp;c. unle&s;s we attribute it to tho&s;e naked
&s;avages, who contrived to carry, in the lea&s;t in|commodious
manner, &s;uch things as appeared to
them to be mo&s;t precious.</P>
<P>But the whim&s;ical varieties in the cu&s;toms of
different nations are &s;till more apparent in the
manner of dre&s;&s;ing and wearing their beards.
The Turks &s;have their heads; but allow their
beards to grow. Mo&s;t Europeans, on the con|trary,
&s;have their beards, and wear their own or
borrowed hair. The &s;avages of America pull
the hairs off their beards, but carefully pre&s;erve
tho&s;e of the head. The Negroes &s;have their heads
in different figures; &s;ometimes they cut their hair
in the &s;hape of little &s;tars, &s;ometimes in the
manner of a friar, but mo&s;t commonly in alter|nate
&s;tripes. The Talapoins of Siam &s;have the
heads and eye-brows of tho&s;e children who&s;e
education is entru&s;ted to them. In this article
every nation has different u&s;ages. Some prefer
the hair on the upper lip to that of the chin;
others e&s;teem hair on the cheek; &s;ome curl it,
and others wear it &s;traight. It is not long &s;ince
we woere our hair behind loo&s;e and floating; we
now inclo&s;e it in a bag. Our dre&s;s is different
from that of our fathers. The differences in
<PB N="454" REF="467">
dre&s;s is as various as the different nations of the
globe: And, what is &s;ingular, we have adopted
that dre&s;s which is mo&s;t incommodious, wa&s;tes
mo&s;t time in adju&s;ting, and is lea&s;t agreeable to
nature.</P>
<P>Though fa&s;hions &s;eem to be founded on ca|price
and fancy; yet, when generally adopted,
they merit examination. Men have always gi|ven
a value to tho&s;e things which excite atten|tion,
and which convey flattering ideas of riches,
power, and grandeur. The value of diamonds,
and other precious &s;tones, ari&s;es from their
&s;carcene&s;s and brilliancy. The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion
applies to tho&s;e &s;hining metals, the weight
of which we regard &s;o little, that, for the &s;ake
of &s;inery, we &s;pread them over our garments.
Ornaments of this kind are intended to excite
the attention of &s;pectators, to give them an idea
of &s;plendor and wealth, and to dazzle their
fancies: How few have the capacity of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
the per&s;on from the dre&s;s, or of e&s;ti|mating
the man in any other manner than by
the metal on his cloaths?</P>
<P>Every thing that is rare and brilliant will,
therefore, always be fa&s;hionable, while men de|rive
more eminence from riches than virtue,
and while the means of acquiring re&s;pect con|tinue
&s;o widely different from real merit. Stran|gers
receive their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of us from our
dre&s;s, which is varied according to the points of
view in which we wi&s;h to be con&s;idered. The
<PB N="455" REF="468">
mode&s;t man, or he who wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;ume that
character, dre&s;&s;es with a &s;implicity corre&s;pond|ing
to the nature of that virtue. The vain-glo|rious,
on the contrary, neglect nothing that can
&s;upport their pride or flatter their vanity; and
they di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;plendor or fine|ne&s;s
in their external appearance.</P>
<P>Another very general object of dre&s;s, is to in|crea&s;e
the &s;ize of our figure, and to occupy more
room in the world than nature has allotted to us.
We wi&s;h to enlarge our dimen&s;ions by high|heeled
&s;hoes and blown up garments; but, how|ever
bulky our dre&s;s, it is exceeded by that va|nity
which it endeavours to cover. Why is the
doctor's head loaded with an enormous quantity
of borrowed hair, while that of the beau is &s;o
thinly covered? The former wi&s;hes to have
the extent of his learning mea&s;ured by the ap|parent
dimen&s;ions of his head; and the latter
de&s;ires to dimini&s;h his head, that he may exhi|bit
the gaiety and &s;prightline&s;s of his genius.</P>
<P>Other fa&s;hions appear to have a more rational
object, namely, to conceal the defects of nature,
or to render them le&s;s di&s;agreeable. Taking
mankind in general, there is a greater number
of deformed bodies, and di&s;agreeable faces, than
of hand&s;ome figures, and beautiful countenan|ces.
Fa&s;hions are always regulated by the prac|tice
of the majority; and, as the greate&s;t
part of mankind have defects to conceal, it is
their intere&s;t to invent and &s;upport tho&s;e modes
<PB N="456" REF="469">
which tend to render their deformities le&s;s con|&s;picuous.
Women never think of paint, till the
natural bloom of their cheeks is faded. Paint|ing,
however, is a very general cu&s;tom. The
mode of whitening the hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;avages of New Guinea powder their heads and beards with chalk. See Recueil des Voyages, &amp;c. tom. 4. p. 637.</NOTE> with powder, and
curling it, is not &s;o univer&s;al; but it &s;eems to
have been intended for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to
make the colours and features of the counte|nance
appear with greater advantage.</P>
<P>But, leaving external ornaments, and the dra|pery
of the picture, let us return to the figure
it&s;elf. The head of man is differently con&s;truc|ted,
both internally and externally, from that of
any other animal. The head of the monkey
makes the neare&s;t approach; its brain, however,
is proportionally le&s;s; and there are other dif|ferences,
to be afterwards taken notice of. The
bodies of almo&s;t all quadrupeds are entirely co|vered
with hair. In man, the head alone has
this ornament before the age of puberty, and it
is more amply furni&s;hed with hair than the head
of any other animal. The monkey re&s;embles
man very much in his ears, no&s;e, and teeth.</P>
<P>Among animals, there is a great diver&s;ity in
the &s;ize, po&s;ition, and number of their teeth.
Some are furni&s;hed with teeth in both jaws;
others have them only in the under-jaw; in
&s;ome they are widely &s;eparated from each other;
<PB N="457" REF="470">
and are clo&s;e and united in others. The pa|late
of &s;ome fi&s;hes is a hard bony plate, &s;tuck
full of &s;harp points, which perform the office of
teeth.</P>
<P>The mouths of mo&s;t animals are armed with
&s;ome &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, which enables them to ap|prehend
or grind their food. The teeth of men,
quadrupeds, and fi&s;hes, the beaks of birds, the
pinchers, &s;aws, &amp;c. of in&s;ects, are all hard in&s;tru|ments,
and, like the nails, horns, and hoofs,
derive their origin from the nerves. We for|merly
remarked, that nerves, when expo&s;ed to
the air, acquire a &s;urpri&s;ing hardne&s;s. As the
mouth gives a free acce&s;s to the air, it is there|fore
natural to think that the nerves which ter|minate
there &s;hould harden, and produce the
teeth, the bony plate, the beak, the pinchers,
and all the other &s;olid parts of animals.</P>
<P>The neck &s;upports the head, and unites it to
the body. It is larger and &s;tronger in mo&s;t
quadrupeds than in man. Fi&s;hes, and other
animals which are not furni&s;hed with lungs &s;imi|lar
to ours, have no neck. Birds, in general,
have longer necks than other animals. Tho&s;e
birds which have &s;hort claws have likewi&s;e &s;hort
necks, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that birds
of prey, which have pounces, are all &s;hort necked.</P>
<P>The human brea&s;t is proportionally larger
than that of other animals; and none but man
and the monkey have collar-bones. The
brea&s;ts of women are larger and more promi|nent
<PB N="458" REF="471">
than tho&s;e of men: But their con&s;i&s;tence
and &s;tructure are nearly the &s;ame; for the
brea&s;ts of men can &s;ecrete milk. There are
many examples of this fact; and it commonly
happens at the age of puberty. I have &s;een a
young man of fifteen years &s;queeze more than a
&s;poonful of milk out of one brea&s;t. Among
animals there is a great variety in the number
and &s;ituation of their paps. Some, as the mon|key
and elephant, have only two placed on the
fore part of the brea&s;t; others have four, as the
bear; others, as the &s;heep, have only two &s;itu|ated
between the hinder legs; others have them
in great numbers upon the belly, as the bitch
and the &s;ow. Birds, and all the oviparous
animals, have no paps. Viviparous fi&s;hes,
as the whale, the dolphin, &amp;c. have brea&s;ts,
and &s;uckle their young. The form of the
brea&s;ts varies in different animals, and even
in the &s;ame animal at different ages. It is al|ledged,
that women who&s;e brea&s;ts are &s;haped
like a pear, make the be&s;t nur&s;es, becau&s;e the
mouth of the child comprehends not only the
nipple, but part of the brea&s;t it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Below the brea&s;t is the belly, in which the
navel makes a con&s;picuous figure. In other a|nimals
it is hardly perceptible; and even the
monkey has nothing but a kind of callo&s;ity in
place of it.</P>
<P>The arms of man have little re&s;emblance to
the fore feet of quadrupeds, and &s;till le&s;s to
<PB N="459" REF="472">
the wings of birds. The monkey tribe are the
only animals which have arms and hands; but
their &s;tructure is more rude, and their propor|tions
le&s;s exact than tho&s;e of man; his &s;houl|ders
are likewi&s;e larger, and differently con|&s;tructed
from tho&s;e of any other animal; and
it is on the top of the &s;houlders that he can bear
the heavie&s;t burdens.</P>
<P>The form of the back differs not much from
that of &s;ome quadrupeds; the region of the
reins is indeed more mu&s;cular and &s;trong. But
the buttocks are peculiar to the human body;
the thighs of quadrupeds are often mi&s;taken for
the&s;e parts, though they be totally different.
Man being the only animal who can &s;upport
him&s;elf perfectly erect, the &s;welling, or cu&s;hion
on the top of his thighs, is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain
him in that po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The human foot is very different from that
of all other animals, the monkey not excepted.
The foot of the ape is rather a kind of hand;
its toes are long, and &s;ituated like fingers, the
middle one being by much the longe&s;t; and it has
no heel. The &s;ole of the foot is likewi&s;e lar|ger
in man, and his toes are better adapted for
pre&s;erving the equilibrium of the body in walk|ing,
running, dancing, and other movements.</P>
<P>The human nails are le&s;s than tho&s;e of other
animals. If they protruded much beyond the
points of the fingers, they would ob&s;truct the
dexterity of the hand. Tho&s;e &s;avages who al|low
<PB N="460" REF="473">
them to grow to an unnatural length, u&s;e
them for flaying and tearing animals. But, al|though
their nails be &s;tronger and longer than
ours, they can by no means be compared to the
hoofs or claws of other animals.</P>
<P>With regard to the proportions of the human
body, we have no exact knowledge. The &s;ame
parts have not the &s;ame proportions in any two
individuals; and, even in the &s;ame per&s;on, the
corre&s;ponding parts are not perfectly &s;imilar.
For example, the right arm or leg have &s;eldom
the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with the left. Repeated
ob&s;ervations alone can a&s;certain a &s;tandard by
which we may be enabled to form a perfect
idea of the natural and be&s;t proportions of the
human figure. It is not be comparing men, or
taking their dimen&s;ions, that we are to expect
any light upon this &s;ubject: We have more
to hope from the art of de&s;igning, and the
efforts which have been made in imitating Na|ture.
Ta&s;te and &s;entiment have exceeded the
limits of mechanical operations. The &s;quare
and compa&s;s are laid a&s;ide, and we tru&s;t more
to the impre&s;&s;ions made on the &s;en&s;es. Every
po&s;&s;ible form has been realized in bronze or in
marble. We recogni&s;e the &s;tandard of Na|ture
more by imitation of her, than by her own
productions; and we judge better concerning
the perfection of a &s;tatue by viewing it, than
by taking its different dimen&s;ions. It is by
long practice in the art of de&s;igning, and by de|licacy
<PB N="461" REF="474">
of &s;entiment, that eminent &s;tatuaries have
been enabled to make men feel the ju&s;tne&s;s of
proportion in the works of Nature. The an|tients
made &s;tatues &s;o exqui&s;itely fine, that they
have uniformly been regarded as exact repre|&s;entations
of the mo&s;t perfect human figures.
The&s;e &s;tatues, which were only copies of the
human form, are now con&s;idered as originals;
becau&s;e they were not imitated from an indivi|dual,
but from the whole &s;pecies &s;o attentively
compared and diligently ob&s;erved, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to find an equal degree of &s;ymmetry
and proportion in any one man that ever ex|i&s;ted.
We &s;hall, therefore, relate the dimen|&s;ions
of the different parts which the&s;e arti&s;ts
have fixed as &s;tandards of perfection. They
commonly divide the height of the body into
ten times the length of the face; they likewi&s;e
divide each <HI>face,</HI> or tenth of the body, into three
equal parts; the fir&s;t commences at the &s;pring|ing
of the hair on the forehead, and terminates
at the root of the no&s;e; the no&s;e is the &s;econd
divi&s;ion; and the third extends from the no&s;e
to the end of the chin. In mea&s;uring the re&s;t
of the body, they u&s;e the term <HI>no&s;e,</HI> or length
of the no&s;e, to denote the third of a face, or the
thirtieth part of the body. The fir&s;t face be|gins
at the root of the hair above the forehead,
and extends to the end of the chin; but, from
the top of the forehead to the crown, there is
&s;till a third of a face, or a no&s;e, in height. Thus,
<PB N="462" REF="475">
from the top of the head to the end of the chin,
there is a face and a third; from the chin to
the juncture of the clavicles, two thirds of a
face; and, therefore, from the top of the brea&s;t
to the crown of the head, is twice the length
of the face, or the fifth of the body; from the
joining of the clavicles to the under part of the
paps, they reckon one face; from this to the
navel is a fourth face; and the fifth extends
from the navel to the divi&s;ion of the inferior
extremities, which &s;hould complete half of the
length of the body. Two faces are exhau&s;ted
between the thigh and knee, to the la&s;t of which
they allow half a face, being the fir&s;t half of
the eight face; two faces are a&s;&s;igned between
the knee and top of the foot, and from that to
the &s;ole half a face, which completes the ten
faces, or length of the body. This divi&s;ion has
been made from men of ordinary &s;ize; but, in
tho&s;e of a higher &s;tature, they allow about half
a face additional between the paps and the com|mencement
of the thighs, which, in tall men, is
not the middle of the body. When the arms
are fully &s;tretched in a horizontal line, the &s;pace
between the tops of the middle fingers is equal
to the length of the body. From the joining of
the collar-bone to the articulation of the &s;houl|der-bone
with that of the arm, is one face.
When the arm hangs down, or is bended for|ward,
it is four faces in length; two between
the joint of the &s;houlder and the elbow, and
<PB N="463" REF="476">
two between the elbow and the root of the
little finger, in all five faces, and an equal num|ber
for the other arm, which is preci&s;ely the
length of the body; about half a face &s;till re|mains
for the length of the fingers; but it mu&s;t
be remarked, that half a face is lo&s;t in the joints
of the elbows and &s;houlders, when the arms are
extended. The hand is about a face in length, the
thumb a third of a face, or a no&s;e, and the longe&s;t
toe is of the &s;ame length with the thumb. The
under part of the foot is equal in length to the
&s;ixth part of the height of the body. For the
rea&s;ons already mentioned, if an experiment be
made of the&s;e dimen&s;ions upon any individual,
they will appear to be extremely imperfect. It
is &s;till more difficult to fix the proportional
thickne&s;s of the different parts of the body.
The changes are &s;o great when the &s;ame man is
meagre, or in good ca&s;e, and the action of the
mu&s;cles in different po&s;itions, creates &s;o much
variety in the dimen&s;ions of the parts, that it is
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to give any determinate rules
upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior parts of the body, in infan|cy,
are larger than the inferior; the thighs and
legs are not nearly equal to half the length
of the whole body; as the child advances in
years, the inferior parts grow more in propor|tion
than the &s;uperior; and, when the growth
is complete, the thighs and legs are very nearly
one half of the length of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="477">
The anterior part of the che&s;t, in women, is
more elevated, and its diameter larger, than in
men; but the che&s;ts of the latter are propor|tionally
broader. The haunches of women are
likewi&s;e larger than tho&s;e of men; becau&s;e the
haunch-bones of women, and tho&s;e which join
them and compo&s;e the pelvis, are proportionally
larger. The&s;e differences in the &s;tructure of the
che&s;t and pelvis are &s;o perceptible, that it is ea&s;y,
by this criterion, to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;keleton of a
woman from that of a man.</P>
<P>There are great varieties in the length of men.
Tho&s;e are &s;aid to be tall who are from five feet
eight inches to &s;ix feet high. The middle &s;ta|ture
is from five feet five to five feet eight;
and tho&s;e who fall below the&s;e dimen&s;ions are
&s;aid to be of &s;mall &s;tature. Women, in general,
are two or three inches below the &s;tandard of
men. Of giants and dwarfs, notice &s;hall be
taken in another place.</P>
<P>Though the human body be externally more
delicate, it is, however, very nervous, and per|haps
&s;tronger, for its &s;ize, than the mo&s;t robu&s;t
quadrupeds. In comparing the force of a lion
to that of a man, it ought to be con&s;idered, that
the lion is armed with teeth and talons; and that
the&s;e dreadful weapons convey a fal&s;e idea of
real &s;trength. The arms which man has recei|ved
from Nature are not offen&s;ive; and happy
had it been, if art had never put into his
<PB N="465" REF="478">
hands weapons more de&s;tructive than the claws
of the lion.</P>
<P>But there is a ju&s;ter method of in&s;tituting a
compari&s;on between the &s;trength of a man and
that of the other animals, namely, by the weight
they are able to carry. It is affirmed, that the
porters of Con&s;tantinople can carry burdens of
nine hundred pounds weight; and De&s;aguliers
tells us, that, by means of a certain harne&s;s, by
which every part of a man's body was propor|tionably
loaded, the per&s;on he employed in this
experiment was able to &s;upport, in an erect po|&s;ture,
a weight not le&s;s than 2000 pounds. A
hor&s;e, which is about &s;ix times the &s;ize of an
ordinary man, ought, therefore, when managed
in the &s;ame manner, to bear 12,000, or 14,000
pounds; an enormous weight, in compari&s;on of
what that animal can &s;upport, even when it is
di&s;tributed with every po&s;&s;ible advantage.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of animals may likewi&s;e be e&s;ti|mated
by agility and per&s;everance in labour.
Men accu&s;tomed to running, out&s;trip hor&s;es, or
at lea&s;t continue their &s;peed much longer; and
a man will accompli&s;h a long journey &s;ooner,
and be le&s;s fatigued, than even the be&s;t road|hor&s;es.
The royal me&s;&s;engers of I&s;pahan, who
are trained to running, go 36 leagues in 14 or
15 hours. We are a&s;&s;ured by travellers, that
the Hottentots out-run lions in the chace; and
that tho&s;e &s;avages who lie upon hunting, pur|&s;ue
and even catch deer, and other animals of
<PB N="466" REF="479">
equal &s;wiftne&s;s. Many other &s;tories are told of
the amazing nimblene&s;s of &s;avages, of the long
journies they accompli&s;h on foot, over the mo&s;t
craggy mountains, where there is no path to
direct, and every ob&s;tacle to ob&s;truct their pro|gre&s;s.
The&s;e people are &s;aid to travel 1000
leagues in &s;ix weeks, or at mo&s;t two months. If
we except birds, who&s;e mu&s;cles are proportion|ally
&s;tronger than tho&s;e of any other animal, no
other creature could &s;upport &s;uch long continued
fatigue. The civilized man is ignorant of his
own &s;trength; nor is he &s;en&s;ible how much he
is weakened by effeminacy, nor to what extent
he might recover his native force by an habitual
and vigorous exerci&s;e of his powers.</P>

be highly valuable in the &s;avage &s;tate, is of little
u&s;e among poli&s;hed nations, where more depends
on mental than corporeal powers, and where
manual labour is confined to the inferior orders
of men.</P>
<P>Men are much &s;tronger than women; and
they have too often employed this &s;uperiority in
exerci&s;ing a cruel and tyrannical dominion over
the weaker &s;ex, who were entitled to &s;hare with
them both the plea&s;ure and the pains of life.
Savage nations condemn the women to perpe|tual
<PB N="467" REF="480">
labour. They cultivate the ground, and per|form
every office of drudgery, while the men
indolently recline in their hammocks, from
which they never think of &s;tirring, unle&s;s when
they go a hunting or fi&s;hing; and &s;o aver&s;e are
they to motion, that they have often been known
to &s;tand in the &s;ame po&s;ition for &s;everal hours.
A &s;avage has no idea of walking for amu&s;ement;
and nothing a&s;toni&s;hes him more than to &s;ee
Europeans walking backwards and forwards in
que&s;t of nothing. All men are naturally indo|lent;
but the &s;avages of warm countries are not
only the mo&s;t lazy of human beings, but the
mo&s;t tyrannical to their women, whom they
treat with a cruel barbarity. In nations more
civilized, men dictate laws to the women. The&s;e
laws are always more &s;evere in proportion to
the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the national manners; and it is
only among people highly poli&s;hed that women
have obtained that equality of condition which
is due to them, and which contributes &s;o power|fully
to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety. This polite|ne&s;s
of manners is the genuine offspring of the
&s;ofter &s;ex; they have oppo&s;ed it to the arms of
the victor, while their mode&s;ty has taught us to
acknowledge the empire of beauty, a natural ad|vantage
greatly &s;uperior to mere &s;trength. But,
to give it full force and value, requires the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of art; for the ideas of beauty are &s;o
different, &s;o capricious, and even contradictory,
that the women, it is probable, have gained more
<PB N="468" REF="481">
by the art of making them&s;elves amiable, than
by beauty it&s;elf, of which men form &s;uch oppo|&s;ite
judgments. Men are agreed as to the ulti|mate
object of their pa&s;&s;ion for the other &s;ex,
the e&s;timation of which is augmented by the
difficulty of obtaining it. The beauty of wo|men
commenced the moment they learned to
make them&s;elves re&s;pectable, by refu&s;ing all ap|proaches
to their hearts which proceeded not from
delicacy of &s;entiment; and, whenever the influ|ence
of &s;entiment was felt, poli&s;hed manners was
a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The ta&s;te of beauty, among the antients, dif|fered
widely from ours. With them, a &s;mall
fore-head and joined eye-brows were charming
features in a female countenance; and, in Per|&s;ia,
large joined eye-brows are &s;till highly e|&s;teemed.
In &s;ome Indian countries, black teeth
and white hair are nece&s;&s;ary ingredients in the
character of a beauty; and in the Marian-i&s;lands
it is a capital object with ladies to blacken
their teeth with herbs, and to bleach their hair
with certain liquors. Beauty, in China and
Japan, is compo&s;ed of a large countenance,
&s;mall and half concealed eyes, a broad no&s;e, little
feet, and a prominent belly. Some Indians of
America and of A&s;ia compre&s;s the heads of their
children between two wooden planks, with a
view to enlarge and beautify the face; others
compre&s;s them laterally, others depre&s;s the
crown only, and others make them as round as
<PB N="469" REF="482">
po&s;&s;ible. Every nation has ideas of beauty pecu|liar
to it&s;elf; and every individual has his own
notions and ta&s;te concerning it. The&s;e peculi|arities
probably originate from the fir&s;t agree|able
impre&s;&s;ions we receive of certain objects;
and therefore depend more upon chance and
habit than upon difference of con&s;titution. When
we come to treat of the &s;en&s;es, we &s;hall perhaps
be able to give more determined ideas concern|ing
tho&s;e perceptions of beauty we receive by
the eye.</P>

<P>EVERY object in Nature mu&s;t change and
decay. No &s;ooner do the bodies of men
arrive at full maturity, than they in&s;tantly be|gin
to decline. The wa&s;te is at fir&s;t in&s;en&s;ible;
&s;everal years frequently revolve before we per|ceive
any con&s;iderable alteration. But we ought
to feel the weight of our years, better than their
number can be e&s;timated by &s;trangers; and, as
tho&s;e are &s;eldom deceived who judge of our age
by external characters, we would be &s;till more
&s;en&s;ible of it from what pa&s;&s;es within us, if we
were more attentive to our feelings, and de|ceived
not our&s;elves by vanity and fallacious
hopes.</P>
<P>When the body has acquired its full length,
it increa&s;es in thickne&s;s: The commencement
of this augmentation is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards
decay; for this exten&s;ion is not a continua|tion
of growth, which would communicate
force and activity, but merely an addition of
&s;uperfluous matter, that blows up the body, and
loads it with a u&s;ele&s;s weight. This matter,
<PB N="471" REF="484">
which is denominated fat, generally appears at
the age of 35 or 40 years; and, in proportion
as the quantity of it augments, the body lo&s;es
its former lightne&s;s and freedom of motion; its
generative faculty is dimini&s;hed; its members
turn unwieldy; and it acquires exten&s;ion at the
expence of &s;trength and activity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the bones increa&s;e in &s;olidity; the nu|tritious
juices, which formerly &s;erved to expand
the bones, now only increa&s;e their quantity of
matter, by filling up their internal cavities; the
membranes are changed into cartilages, and the
cartilages into bones; the fibres of the mu&s;cles
grow rigid; the &s;kin is deprived of its moi&s;ture,
and wrinkles are gradually formed in it; the
hair turns hoary; the teeth fall out; the vi&s;age
a&s;&s;umes a hagard appearance, the body bends
forward, &amp;c. The fir&s;t approaches of this &s;tate
are perceptible before the age of 40; they ad|vance
by &s;low degrees till 60, and more rapidly
from that to 70, when decrepitude commences,
and continues to augment till 90 or 100, when
death puts a final period to our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now take a more particular &s;urvey
of the&s;e changes; and, as we have inquired into
the cau&s;es of the growth and expan&s;ion of the
human body, let us al&s;o inve&s;tigate tho&s;e of its
decay and di&s;&s;olution. At the commencement
of our exi&s;tence, the bones are only &s;mall fibres,
of a &s;oft and ductile &s;ub&s;tance, and gradually
acquire con&s;i&s;tence and &s;olidity. They may be
<PB N="472" REF="485">
con&s;idered, in their original &s;tate, as &s;mall tubes
lined, both within and without, with a thin
membrane: This double membrane furni&s;hes
the o&s;&s;eous matter; for the &s;mall interval be|tween
the internal and external perio&s;teum is
&s;oon converted into a bony plate. Some idea
of the production and growth of bones may be
formed, by comparing them with the manner
in which wood and the more &s;olid parts of ve|getables
are produced. We &s;hall take, for ex|ample,
the fig-tree or the alder, which are at
fir&s;t hollow in the middle, like the thigh and
other hollow bones of the body. When a bud,
that is to form a branch, begins to extend, it is
only a &s;oft ductile matter, which, by exten&s;ion,
becomes a &s;lender herbaceous tube filled with
pith. The external and internal &s;urfaces of
this tube are covered with a fibrous membrane,
as well as the internal partitions by which the
cavity is divided. The&s;e membranes, however
thin, are compo&s;ed of &s;everal plates of fibres
lying above each other, which are &s;till &s;oft,
but gradually harden by depo&s;ing the &s;ap
which they ab&s;orb for their nouri&s;hment; and
by this means a woody plate is formed, du|ring
the fir&s;t year, between the two membranes,
which is more or le&s;s thick in proportion to the
quantity of &s;ap that has been depo&s;ited between
the external and internal membranes. But,
though each of the&s;e membranes become woody
internally, their external &s;urfaces remain &s;oft
<PB N="473" REF="486">
and ductile; and, the following year, when the
bud at the top of the branch begins to expand,
the &s;ap ri&s;es through the &s;oft fibres of each
membrane, and converts them, by its &s;ediments,
into other woody plates. The &s;ame proce&s;s
goes on annually; and, in this manner, the tree
or branch gradually increa&s;es in thickne&s;s. The
internal cavity likewi&s;e augments in proportion
to the growth of the branch; becau&s;e the inter|nal
membrane extends along with the other
parts, and the woody plates are only applied
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the plates already formed. If we
examine a branch, or ajoint, which has been the
product of one year, we &s;hall find, that it uni|formly
pre&s;erves the &s;ame figure through all the
&s;tages of its growth. The joints or knots which
mark the production of each year, become fixed
points for the reaction of tho&s;e powers that ex|pand
the contiguous parts during the following
year. The &s;uperior buds react again&s;t the&s;e
points, and, by expanding them&s;elves, form new
branches or joints in the &s;ame manner as the fir&s;t
were produced.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of o&s;&s;ification would be very &s;i|milar
to that we have now de&s;cribed, if the fixed
points of the bones began at the extremities, in
place of the middle. At fir&s;t the bones of the
foetus are only &s;mall threads, or tubes, of a duc|tile
matter, which are ea&s;ily perceived through
the delicate and tran&s;parent &s;kin. The thigh|bone,
for example, is then a &s;mall &s;hort tube,
<PB N="474" REF="487">
like the herbaceous tubes above de&s;cribed. This
tube is &s;hut at both ends by a pulpy &s;ub&s;tance,
and its external and internal &s;urfaces are cover|ed
with two membranes compo&s;ed of &s;everal
layers of &s;oft and ductile fibres. In proportion
as this tube receives nutritious juices, the two
extremities extend and recede from the middle
point, which always pre&s;erves the &s;ame &s;tation.
The extremities cannot extend without reacting
again&s;t this middle point; and the parts which are
neare&s;t it begin fir&s;t to acquire &s;olidity. The
fir&s;t bony plate, like the fir&s;t plate of wood, is
produced in the interval which &s;eparates the
two membranes or perio&s;tea. But the o&s;&s;ifica|tion
commences in the middle, and gradually
extends to the extremities, which remain &s;oft
long after the middle parts are converted into
bone. The middle parts of bones, therefore,
being fir&s;t o&s;&s;ified, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they
&s;hould afterwards expand equally with tho&s;e
parts which remain longer in a &s;oft and ductile
&s;tate. This is the rea&s;on why bones are always
thinne&s;t in the middle, and thicke&s;t at the ex|tremities.
But, independent of this difference
between the longitudinal growth of bones and
of wood, the analogy between their increa&s;e in
thickne&s;s is very &s;triking: For the fir&s;t bony
plate is produced from the internal part of the
perio&s;teum; and, after the formation of this
plate between the two perio&s;tea, two other plates
are &s;oon formed, one on each &s;ide of the fir&s;t,
<PB N="475" REF="488">
to which they adhere; and, by this means, both
the circumference of the bone, and the diameter
of its cavity, are augmented. Thus the interior
parts of the two perio&s;tea continue &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
to produce bony plates, in the &s;ame manner as
woody plates are produced from the bark of
vegetables.</P>
<P>But, after the bone has acquired its full
growth, after the perio&s;tea cea&s;e to furni&s;h o&s;&s;e|ous
matter, then the nutritious juices, which
were formerly employed in augmenting the
bulk of the bone, &s;erve only to increa&s;e its den|&s;ity.
The&s;e juices depo&s;ite them&s;elves in the
internal parts of the bones, and give them more
weight and &s;olidity, as may ea&s;ily be perceived
by comparing the weight and den&s;ity of an ox
with tho&s;e of a calf. The &s;ub&s;tance of the bones
become, in proce&s;s of time, &s;o compact, as not
to admit the circulation of tho&s;e juices which are
nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport and nouri&s;hment.
The &s;ub&s;tance of the bones, therefore, mu&s;t now
undergo a change &s;imilar to that which takes
place in old trees, after they have acquired their
full &s;olidity; and this change is one of the fir&s;t
cau&s;es which render the di&s;&s;olution of the hu|man
body inevitable.</P>
<P>The cartilages, which may be regarded as &s;oft
and imperfect bones, likewi&s;e receive nutritious
juices, which gradually augment their den&s;ity.
They become more and more &s;olid as we ad|vance
in years; and, in old age, they are almo&s;t
<PB N="476" REF="489">
as hard as bones. This rigidity of the cartilages
renders the motion of the joints extremely dif|ficult,
and, at la&s;t, deprives us of the u&s;e of
our members, and produces a total ce&s;&s;ation of
external movements. This is a &s;econd, and
more marked cau&s;e of death, becau&s;e it mani|fe&s;ts
it&s;elf by a laborious performance of the
common actions of the body.</P>
<P>The membranes likewi&s;e become hard and
dry, as we advance in years. Tho&s;e, for ex|ample,
which &s;urround the bones, &s;oon lo&s;e
their flexibility. At the age of 20, they are in|capable
of farther exten&s;ion. The mu&s;cular
fibres &s;uffer a &s;imilar change, in proportion to
the time of life; though, to the touch, they &s;eem
to be &s;ofter as age increa&s;es. It is not the mu&s;|cles,
however, but the &s;kin, that occa&s;ions this
perception. After the body is come to its full
growth, the fat increa&s;es, and, by being inter|po&s;ed
between the fibres of the mu&s;cles, and be|tween
the &s;kin and the mu&s;cles them&s;elves,
makes them feel &s;ofter, when, in reality, their
den&s;ity is greatly increa&s;ed. Of this we have
an inconte&s;tible proof by comparing the fle&s;h of
young with that of old animals. In the for|mer,
it is tender and delicate; but, in the latter,
it is dry, hard, and unfit for eating.</P>
<P>The &s;kin always extends as the body increa&s;es;
but, when the body dimini&s;hes, the &s;kin has not
ela&s;ticity enough to enable it to contract to its
former dimen&s;ions: It, therefore, continues in
<PB N="477" REF="490">
wrinkles and folds, which can never be effaced.
The wrinkles of the face partly ari&s;e from this
cau&s;e; but, in their production, they have a
relation to the form, to the features, and to the
habitual motions of the countenance. If we
examine the face of a man of 25 or 30 years of
age, we may trace the origin of all the wrinkles
which will appear in old age, e&s;pecially when he
laughs, cries, or makes any violent grimace.
All the folds which are exhibited in the&s;e actions
will in time become indelible wrinkles.</P>
<P>In proportion as we advance in years, the
bones, the cartilages, the membranes, the fle&s;h,
the &s;kin, and every fibre of the body, become
more &s;olid, hard, and dry. Every part &s;hrinks
and contracts; and every movement is perform|ed
with &s;lowne&s;s and difficulty: The circulation
of the fluids is &s;luggi&s;h and interrupted; per&s;pi|ration
is dimini&s;hed; the &s;ecretions change; di|ge&s;tion
becomes &s;low and laborious; the nutri|tious
juices are le&s;s abundant, and, being rejec|ted
by parts which are already too den&s;e, they
communicate no &s;upplies. The&s;e parts, there|fore,
may be regarded as already dead, becau&s;e
they have cea&s;ed to receive nouri&s;hment. Thus
the body dies by inches; its motions gradually
decay; life wears away by imperceptible de|grees;
and death is only the la&s;t term in the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As, in women, the bones, the cartilages, the
mu&s;cles, and every other part of the body, are
<PB N="478" REF="491">
&s;ofter and le&s;s &s;olid than tho&s;e of men, they
mu&s;t require more time in hardening to that
degree which occa&s;ions death: Women, of
cour&s;e, ought to live longer than men. This
rea&s;oning is confirmed by experience; for, by
con&s;ulting the bills of mortality, it appears, that,
after women have pa&s;&s;ed a certain age, they live
much longer than men who have arrived at the
&s;ame age.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it may al&s;o be con|cluded,
that men who have a weakly appear|ance,
and approach nearer to the con&s;titution of
women, &s;hould live longer than tho&s;e who are
more robu&s;t; and likewi&s;e, that per&s;ons of either
&s;ex, who are long before they arrive at their full
growth, &s;hould outlive tho&s;e who advance more
rapidly to that point; becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, the
bones, cartilages, and fibres, are later in arriving
at that degree of &s;olidity which is nece&s;&s;ary to
their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This natural cau&s;e of death is common to all
animals, and even to vegetables. An oak only
peri&s;hes, becau&s;e the olde&s;t parts of the wood,
which are in the centre, become &s;o hard and
compact, that they can receive no farther nou|ri&s;hment.
The moi&s;ture they contain being de|prived
of circulation, and not being replaced by
fre&s;h &s;ap, ferments, corrupts, and gradually re|duces
the fibres of the wood into powder.</P>
<P>The duration of life may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
be computed by the time occupied in growth.
A plant or an animal that acquires maturity in
<PB N="479" REF="492">
a &s;hort time, peri&s;hes much &s;ooner than tho&s;e
which are longer in arriving at that period. In
animals, as well as vegetables, the longitudinal
growth is fir&s;t fini&s;hed. Man grows in &s;tature
till he be 16 or 18 years of age; but his body
is not completely unfolded in thickne&s;s before
that of 30. Dogs acquire their full length in
le&s;s than one year; but their growth in thick|ne&s;s
is not fini&s;hed till the &s;econd year. A man,
who grows 30 years, lives till 90 or 100; and a
dog, who&s;e growth terminates in two or three
years, lives only 10 or 12. The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion
may be applied to mo&s;t animals. Fi&s;hes
continue to grow for a great number of years;
they accordingly live for centuries; becau&s;e
their bones never acquire the den&s;ity of tho&s;e of
other animals. When we give the particular
hi&s;tory of animals, we &s;hall examine whether
there be any exception to this rule, which Na|ture
&s;eems to follow in proportioning the du|ration
of life to the time of growth, and whether
crows and &s;tags live &s;o long as is commonly ima|gined.
But it may be laid down as a general
fact, that large animals live much longer than
&s;mall animals, becau&s;e they require more time
to fini&s;h their growth.</P>
<P>Thus the cau&s;es of our di&s;&s;olution are inevi|table;
and it is equally impo&s;&s;ible to retard that
fatal period, as to change the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of
Nature. The ideas of tho&s;e vi&s;ionaries, who
conceived the po&s;&s;ibility of perpetuating human
<PB N="480" REF="493">
life by the u&s;e of certain medicines, would
have peri&s;hed with them&s;elves, if &s;elf-love did
not always induce us to believe what exceeds
the powers of Nature, and to be &s;ceptical with
regard to the mo&s;t certain and invariable truths.
The univer&s;al panacea, the transfu&s;ion of the
blood, and other methods which have been pro|po&s;ed
to render our bodies immortal, are as chi|merical
as the fountain of youth is fabulous.</P>
<P>When the con&s;titution is &s;ound, life may,
perhaps, be prolonged for a few years, by mo|derating
the pa&s;&s;ions, and by temperance. But
even this is a doubtful point; for, if it be nece&s;|&s;ary
that the body &s;hould exert its whole force,
and that it &s;hould wa&s;te all its powers by labour
and exerci&s;e, what advantages can we derive
from regimen and ab&s;tinence? Some men have
indeed exceeded the ordinary term of human
life: Without mentioning tho&s;e extraordinary
in&s;tances of longevity recorded in the Philo&s;o|phical
Tran&s;actions, &s;uch as that of Par who
lived to the age of 144, and of Jenkins who
lived 165 years, we have many examples of the
prolongation of life to 110, and even 120.
The&s;e men, however, u&s;ed no peculiar arts for
the pre&s;ervation of their bodies. They appear,
on the contrary, to have been pea&s;ants, hunt&s;|men,
labourers, and people accu&s;tomed to abu&s;e
their bodies, if it be po&s;&s;ible to abu&s;e them by
any other means than tho&s;e of continual idlene&s;s
and debauchery.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="494">
Be&s;ides, the varieties of climate, and of the
modes of living, make no difference as to the
period of our exi&s;tence, which is the &s;ame in the
European, the Negro, the Chine&s;e, the Ameri|can,
the civilized man and the &s;avage, the rich
and the poor, the citizen and the pea&s;ant. Nei|ther
does the difference of races, of food, or of
accommodation, make any change on the dura|tion
of life. Men who feed upon raw fle&s;h or
dried fi&s;h, on &s;ago or rice, on ca&s;&s;ada or roots,
live as long as tho&s;e who are nouri&s;hed with
bread and prepared victuals. It is apparent,
therefore, that the duration of life has no de|pendence
either on manners or cu&s;toms, or the
qualities of particular food: If luxury and in|temperance
be excepted, nothing can alter tho&s;e
laws of mechani&s;m which regulate the number
of our years.</P>
<P>Any little differences which may be remarked
in the term of human life &s;eem to be owing to
the quality of the air. There are generally
more old men in high than in low countries.
The mountains of Scotland, of Wales, of Au|vergne,
and of Switzerland, have furni&s;hed
more examples of extreme old age than the
plains of Holland, Flanders, Germany, or Po|land.
But, taking mankind in general, there is
hardly any difference in the duration of life.
When men are not cut off by accidental di&s;ea&s;es,
they every where live 90 or 100 years. Our
ance&s;tors never exceeded this period; and, &s;ince
<PB N="482" REF="495">
the age of David, it has &s;uffered no variation.
If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, why the fir&s;t races of men
lived 900, 930, and even 969 years? we may,
perhaps, be able to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer.
The productions of the earth were then of a
different nature. The &s;urface of the globe, as
we remarked when treating of the Theory of the
Earth, was, in the fir&s;t ages of the world, le&s;s
&s;olid and compact; becau&s;e, gravity having act|ed
only for a &s;hort time, terre&s;trial bodies had
not acquired their pre&s;ent den&s;ity and con&s;i|&s;tence.
The produce of the earth, therefore,
mu&s;t have been analogous to its condition. The
&s;urface being more loo&s;e and moi&s;t, its produc|tions
would, of cour&s;e, be more ductile and ca|pable
of exten&s;ion: Their growth, therefore,
and even that of the human body, would require
a longer time of being completed. The &s;oft|ne&s;s
and ductility of the bones, mu&s;cles, &amp;c.
would probably remain for a longer period, be|cau&s;e
every &s;pecies of food was more &s;oft and
&s;ucculent. Hence, the full expan&s;ion of the hu|man
body, or when it was capable of generating,
mu&s;t have required 120 or 130 years; and the
duration of life would be in proportion to the
time of growth, as is uniformly the ca&s;e at
pre&s;ent: For, if we &s;uppo&s;e the age of puberty,
among the fir&s;t races of men, to have been 130
years, as they now arrive at that age in 14 years,
the age of the Antedeluvians will be in exact
proportion to that of the pre&s;ent race; &s;ince, by
<PB N="483" REF="496">
multiplying the&s;e two numbers by &s;even, for
example, the age of the pre&s;ent race will be 90,
and that of the Antedeluvians will be 910. The
period of man's exi&s;tence, therefore, may have
gradually dimini&s;hed in proportion as the &s;ur|face
of the earth acquired more &s;olidity by the
con&s;tant action of gravity; and it is probable,
that the period from the creation, to the days
of David, was &s;ufficient to give the earth all
the den&s;ity it was capable of receiving from the
influence of gravitation; and, con&s;equently, that
the &s;urface of the earth has ever &s;ince remained
in the &s;ame &s;tate, and that the terms of growth
in the productions of the earth, as well as the
duration of life, have been invariably fixed
from that period.</P>
<P>Independent of accidental di&s;ea&s;es, which are
more frequent and dangerous in the latter pe|riods
of life, old men are &s;ubject to natural in|firmities
that originate &s;olely from the decay of
the different parts of the body. The mu&s;cles
lo&s;e their tone, the head &s;hakes, the hands trem|ble,
the legs totter, the &s;en&s;ibility of the nerves
decrea&s;es, and every &s;en&s;e is blunted. But the
incapacity for generating is the mo&s;t characteri&s;|tic
infirmity of old age. This impotency may
be a&s;cribed to two cau&s;es; an alteration in the
&s;eminal fluid, and a want of ten&s;ion in the ex|ternal
organs. The defect of ten&s;ion is ea&s;ily
explained from the conformation of the organ
it&s;elf, which is a &s;pongy cavernous &s;ub&s;tance,
<PB N="484" REF="497">
fitted to receive into its cavities a great quantity
of blood, in order both to increa&s;e its &s;ize, and
to render it more rigid. In youth, this organ
is &s;oft and flexible; and, of cour&s;e, it is ea&s;ily
extended by the impul&s;e of the blood. But, as
we advance in years, like every other part of
the body, it becomes more &s;olid, and lo&s;es its
flexibility. Hence, though the impul&s;e of the
blood were equal to what it was in youth, this
impul&s;e is unable to dilate an organ which has
become too den&s;e to admit blood in a quantity
&s;ufficient to produce an erection, that will an&s;wer
the purpo&s;es of generation.</P>
<P>With regard to the change, or rather &s;terility of
the &s;eminal fluid, it cannot be prolific unle&s;s when
it contains organic particles tran&s;mitted from
every part of the body; for we have already
&s;hown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, ch. 2. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE>, that the production of a &s;mall orga|nized
being, &s;imilar to its parent, cannot be ef|fected
without the union of the organic particles
&s;ent from all parts of the body. But, in very
aged men, the parts have become too &s;olid, and
can neither receive, a&s;&s;imilate, nor tran&s;mit, the
nutritive and prolific particles. The bones and
other &s;olids, therefore, can neither produce nor
tran&s;mit organic particles corre&s;pondent to their
own natures; the&s;e particles mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be
wanting in the &s;eminal fluids of old men; and
this defect is &s;ufficient to render them incapable
of generating.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="498">
But, admitting the &s;terility of old men to be
owing to a defect in the organic particles of
their &s;eminal fluids, this defect may &s;till be &s;up|plied
by a young woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, ch. 10.</NOTE>, which not unfre|quently
happens; for old men &s;ometimes, though
rarely, generate; and, when they do produce,
they have a much &s;maller &s;hare in their children
than young men. This is likewi&s;e one rea&s;on
why young women, who are married to old, de|crepit,
and deformed men, often produce mon|&s;ters,
or children &s;till more deformed than their
fathers. But this is not a proper place for &s;uch
di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of mankind die of the &s;cur|vy,
the drop&s;y, or other di&s;ea&s;es which &s;eem to
proceed from a vitiation of the blood and other
fluids. Whatever influence the fluids may have
in the animal oeconomy, they are only pa&s;&s;ive
and divi&s;ible &s;ub&s;tances, and obey the impul&s;es
of the &s;olids, which are the true organic active
parts, and upon which the motion, the quality,
and even the quantity of the fluids entirely de|pend.
In old age, the cavities of the ve&s;&s;els
contract, the mu&s;cles lo&s;e their tone, the &s;ecre|tory
organs are ob&s;tructed; the blood, the lymph,
and the other fluids, of cour&s;e, grow vi&s;cid, ex|trava&s;ate,
and produce all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es and
&s;ymptoms which are u&s;ually a&s;cribed to a vitia|tion
of the humours. But the natural decay of
the &s;olids is the original cau&s;e of the&s;e maladies.
<PB N="486" REF="499">
Though it be true, that the bad &s;tate of the
fluids proceeds from a depravity in the organiza|tion
of the &s;olids; yet the effects re&s;ulting from
a change in the fluids produce the mo&s;t alarm|ing
&s;ymptoms, if they become &s;tagnant, or be
ob&s;tructed in their circulation by the contrac|tion
of the ve&s;&s;els; if, by the relaxation of the
ve&s;&s;els, they extrava&s;ate, they mu&s;t &s;oon corrupt,
and corrode the weaker parts of the &s;olids. In
this manner the cau&s;es of de&s;truction perpetual|ly
multiply; our internal enemies grow more
and more powerful, and at la&s;t put a period to
our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>All the cau&s;es of decay which I have men|tioned
above, act continually upon the human
body, and gradually lead to its di&s;&s;olution. Death,
which appears &s;o terrible to us, is only the la&s;t
term in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of evils. Life begins to
decay long before it is entirely extingui&s;hed;
and the changes are perhaps greater from youth
till the beginning of our decay, than from de|crepitude
to death; for we ought here to con&s;i|der
life as a &s;ubject capable of augmentation and
of diminution. When the foetus is fir&s;t form|ed,
the quantity of life is almo&s;t equal to no|thing:
It gradually extends and acquire con|&s;i&s;tence
and force, in proportion to the growth
and expan&s;ion of the body. On the other hand,
when the body begins to decay, the quantity of
life dimini&s;hes, till its final extinction. Thus
<PB N="487" REF="500">
life both commences and terminates by imper|ceptible
degrees.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould we be afraid of death, if
we have no rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ions of its con|&s;equences?
Why dread this &s;ingle moment, which
has been preceded by an infinity of others of the
&s;ame order; &s;ince death is fully as natural as
life, and both arrive in the &s;ame manner, without
our being able to perceive their approach? If we
inquire of phy&s;icians, and tho&s;e who are accu|&s;tomed
to ob&s;erve the actions and &s;entiments of
the dying, we &s;hall find, that, excepting in a few
acute di&s;ea&s;es, attended with agitations and con|vul&s;ions,
which exhibit only the appearances of
pain, mo&s;t men expire quietly, and without the
&s;malle&s;t indication of unea&s;ine&s;s. Even when
patients &s;eem to be afflicted with the mo&s;t dread|ful
agonies, they have no exi&s;tence but in the
imagination of the &s;pectator: The truth of this
has been repeatedly atte&s;ted by many people
who have recovered after the mo&s;t violent com|motions
and convul&s;ions, who, notwith&s;tanding,
were unable to recollect a &s;ingle pang they had
felt, or a &s;ingle idea or &s;entiment that had pa&s;|&s;ed
during this &s;eemingly di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of mankind, therefore, die
without being &s;en&s;ible of the fatal &s;troke; and
of tho&s;e who pre&s;erve their &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t
groan, there is not, perhaps, one who does not
entertain &s;ome hope of recovery. Nature, for
the happine&s;s of man, has rendered this princi|ple
<PB N="488" REF="501">
much &s;tronger than rea&s;on. Men never
cea&s;e to flatter them&s;elves with hopes of recove|ry,
even though they might judge of their real
condition from the example of others who had
been afflicted with the &s;ame incurable di&s;orders,
from the tears of their friends, and from the
countenances or de&s;ertion of their phy&s;icians.
All the&s;e mortifying circum&s;tances are only re|garded
as premature and ill-grounded fears; and
hope never leaves us, till death &s;huts the &s;cene.</P>
<P>A &s;ick man tells you, that he feels the hand of
death, that the king of terrors is ju&s;t about to
arrive, and that recovery is impo&s;&s;ible: But if,
from zeal or indi&s;cretion, he is informed of his
approaching di&s;&s;olution, his countenance in&s;tant|ly
changes, and he betrays all that unea&s;ine&s;s
which naturally attends the fir&s;t intimation of
death. This man, it is evident, gives no credit
to his own a&s;&s;ertions. He may entertain &s;ome
doubts concerning his &s;ituation; but his hopes
are always &s;uperior to his fears: And, if he were
not alarmed by that cruel parade of grief which
too often imbitters the &s;ick man's couch, he
would never perceive the approach of his di&s;&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>Death, therefore, is not that horrible object
which we have fancied to our&s;elves. It is a
&s;pectre which terrifies us at a di&s;tance, but di&s;|appears
when we come more clo&s;e to it. Our
conceptions of it are founded on prejudice; and
we regard it not only as the greate&s;t of all mi&s;|fortunes,
<PB N="489" REF="502">
but as accompanied with the mo&s;t ex|cruciating
tortures. The pain, it is &s;aid, mu&s;t
be extreme when the &s;oul &s;eparates from the
body; its duration may al&s;o be long, &s;ince time
is mea&s;ured by the celerity of ideas; and one
painful moment, by augmenting the rapidity of
our ideas, may have the appearance of an age,
when the train of ideas proceeds with their
u&s;ual gentlene&s;s and tranquillity. This rea|&s;oning
is &s;uch an abu&s;e of philo&s;ophy, that,
if it had no influence in increa&s;ing the mi&s;eries
of human life, it merits nothing but &s;ilence and
contempt. As &s;uch arguments, however, gain
credit with weak minds, and render the a&s;pect
of death a thou&s;and times more hideous than
it really is, a refutation of them may be attend|ed
with utility.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is fir&s;t united to the body, do
we feel a joy that tran&s;ports us? No. This u|nion
is effected without our perception; why,
then, &s;hould we be con&s;cious of their di&s;&s;olution?
What rea&s;on have we to believe that the &s;epara|tion
of the &s;oul and body is attended with ex|treme
pain? What cau&s;e &s;hould produce this
pain? Does it re&s;ide in the &s;oul or in the body?
Pain of mind can only re&s;ult from thought; and
pain of body is always proportioned to its &s;trength
or weakne&s;s. At the approach of natural death,
the body is in its weake&s;t &s;tate, and, of cour&s;e,
it can feel but very little, if any pain.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="503">
Let us now &s;uppo&s;e a violent death: Can the
&s;ufferings of a man, for example, who&s;e head is
carried off by a cannon-ball, be more than in|&s;tantaneous?
Can the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his ideas, du|ring
this in&s;tant, be &s;o rapid as to make the pain
&s;eem to continue for an hour, a day, or a cen|tury?
We &s;hall endeavour to di&s;cu&s;s this point.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ide|as
is the only natural mea&s;ure of time, and that
we conceive it to be &s;horter or longer in propor|tion
to the uniformity or irregularity of their
motions. But, in this mea&s;ure, there is a unit
or &s;ixed point, which is neither arbitrary nor in|definite,
but is determined by nature, and cor|re&s;ponds
with the particular organization of in|dividuals.
Two ideas, which &s;ucceed each other,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;eparated by an interval;
one thought, however rapid, mu&s;t require
&s;ome portion of time before it can be follow|ed
by another. No &s;ucce&s;&s;ion can take place
in an indivi&s;ible in&s;tant. The &s;ame remark is
applicable to &s;entiment or feeling. A certain
time mu&s;t elap&s;e in the tran&s;ition from pain to
plea&s;ure, or from one painful &s;en&s;ation to ano|ther.
This interval between our thoughts and
&s;en&s;ations is the unit or fixed point formerly
mentioned; and it can neither be extremely
long nor extremely &s;hort, but mu&s;t be nearly e|qual
in its duration; becau&s;e it depends on the
nature of the mind and the organization of the
body, the movements of which mu&s;t have a de|termined
degree of celerity. In the &s;ame indi|vidual,
<PB N="491" REF="504">
therefore, there can be no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
ideas &s;o rapid, or &s;o &s;low, as to produce that e|normous
difference in duration, by which a mo|mentary
pain is prolonged to that of an hour, a
day, or a century.</P>
<P>A very acute pain, if continued for a certain
time, uniformly brings on either fainting or
death. Our organs, which are only endowed
with a certain degree of force, cannot re&s;i&s;t more
than a certain quantity of pain. If the pain be|comes
exce&s;&s;ive, the organs are unable to &s;up|port
it; and, of cour&s;e, they can tran&s;mit no in|telligence
of it to the mind, with which there
is no corre&s;pondence but by the di&s;tinct action
of the&s;e organs. In this ca&s;e, the action of the
organs is interrupted; and, con&s;equently, all
internal &s;en&s;ation is at an end.</P>
<P>What I have already remarked is perhaps
more than &s;ufficient to evince, that the in&s;tant
of death is neither accompanied with extreme
nor long-continued pain. But, in order to era|dicate
the fears of the mo&s;t timid of mankind,
we &s;hall &s;till add a few words upon this &s;ubject.
Exce&s;&s;ive pain extingui&s;hes all reflection, though
&s;ome &s;ymptoms of it have &s;ometimes appeared in
the very moment of violent death. When Charles
XII. received the blow which terminated, in an
in&s;tant, both his enterprizes and his exi&s;tence,
he clapped his hand upon his &s;word. This mor|tal
pang, &s;ince it excluded not reflection, could
not be exce&s;&s;ive. He found him&s;elf attacked;
<PB N="492" REF="505">
he con&s;idered that he ought to defend him&s;elf;
it is evident, therefore, that he felt no greater
pain than he would have &s;uffered from an ordi|nary
&s;troke. This action could not be the re|&s;ult
of a mechanical impul&s;e; for I have &s;hewn,
in the de&s;cription of man, that the mo&s;t preci|pitate
movements of the pa&s;&s;ions depend upon
reflection, and are nothing but habitual exer|tions
of the mind.</P>
<P>I would not have dwelt &s;o long upon this
&s;ubject, if I had not been anxious to eradicate a
prejudice &s;o repugnant to the happine&s;s of man.
I have &s;een many victims &s;acrificed to this pre|judice,
e&s;pecially among the female &s;ex, who
die daily through the terror of death. Such
dreadful apprehen&s;ions &s;eem peculiarly to affect
tho&s;e who, by nature or education, are endowed
with &s;uperior &s;en&s;ibility; for the vulgar look
forward to their di&s;&s;olution, either with indiffe|rence,
or, at lea&s;t, without any degree of ter|ror.</P>
<P>True philo&s;ophy views objects as they exi&s;t.
Our internal feelings would uniformly accord
with this philo&s;ophy, if they were not pervert|ed
by the illu&s;ions of imagination, and by the
unfortunate habit of creating hypothetical phan|toms
of exce&s;&s;ive pains, and of plea&s;ures which
exceed the limits of human nature. Objects
are only terrible or ravi&s;hing, at a di&s;tance;
when we have the re&s;olution or the wi&s;dom to
take a near in&s;pection of them, every alarming
<PB N="493" REF="506">
and every alluring circum&s;tance in&s;tantly di&s;|appear.</P>
<P>If this doctrine, concerning the gradual and
generally in&s;en&s;ible decay of the vital powers,
required any farther &s;upport, no incon&s;iderable
aid might be derived to it from the uncertainty of
the &s;igns of death. If we con&s;ult the writers on this
&s;ubject, and particularly tho&s;e of Win&s;low and
Bruhier, we &s;hall receive full conviction, that,
between life and death, the &s;hade is often &s;o un|di&s;tingui&s;hable,
as to elude all the powers of the
medical art. They inform us, 'That the co|lour
of the face, the heat of the body, the &s;up|plene&s;s
of the joints, are uncertain marks of
life; and that the palene&s;s of the countenance,
the coldne&s;s of the body, the rigidity of the
extremities, the ce&s;&s;ation of motion, and the
abolition of the &s;en&s;es, are very equivocal &s;igns
of death.' The &s;ame remark may be made
with regard to the apparent ce&s;&s;ation of the pul&s;e,
and of re&s;piration: The&s;e motions are often &s;o
&s;low, that they elude all our perceptions. A
mirror or a candle is applied near the mouth of
a &s;ick man; if the mirror be &s;ullied, or the flame
vibrates, life is concluded not to be extingui&s;hed.
But the&s;e effects are often produced, after death
has actually taken place; and &s;ometimes they
appear not, though the patient be &s;till alive.
When we wi&s;h to be certain of the death of any
per&s;on, we apply fumes of tobacco, and other
irritating bodies to the no&s;trils; we endeavour
<PB N="494" REF="507">
to excite the organs by violent agitations, by
pricking or &s;carifying the hands and feet, by
applying red hot iron or wax to different parts
of the body, by rai&s;ing loud and unu&s;ual cries,
&amp;c. But in&s;tances have occurred where all the&s;e
and &s;imilar trials have proved abortive; and yet,
to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectators, the per|&s;on
&s;uppo&s;ed to be dead has afterwards recover|ed
the powers of life.</P>
<P>Hence, nothing can be more apparent, than
that a certain condition of life has a great
re&s;emblance to actual death. Both humanity
and rea&s;on, therefore, require that we &s;hould be
cautious of abandoning the body, and of com|mitting
it too ha&s;tily to the grave. Neither ten,
twenty, nor twenty-four hours are &s;ufficient to
di&s;tingui&s;h a real from an apparent death; &s;ince
in&s;tances are not wanting of per&s;ons returning
from the tomb at the end of two and of three
days. Why &s;hould we precipitate the interment
of tho&s;e per&s;ons, the prolongation of who&s;e lives
we mo&s;t ardently de&s;ire? Why &s;hould a prac|tice
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, in the abolition of which all men
are equally intere&s;ted? Are not the frequent a|bu&s;es
recorded by phy&s;icians &s;ufficient to deter us
from too ha&s;ty interments? Mr Win&s;low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Win&s;low di&s;&s;ert. &s;ur l'incertitude des &s;ignes de la mort, p. 34.</NOTE> in|forms
us, 'That the body, though living, is
&s;ometimes &s;o completely deprived of every vi|tal
function, that it has every external appear|ance
<PB N="495" REF="508">
of death. But,' he remarks, 'both re|ligion
and charity require, that a rea&s;onable
time &s;hould be allowed to di&s;cover whether any
&s;igns of life may not &s;till manife&s;t them&s;elves,
otherwi&s;e we become actual murderers, by
burying people who are not dead. If we may
credit the greate&s;t number of authors, three
days, or 72 hours, are &s;ufficient for this pur|po&s;e.
If, during this period, no &s;igns of life
appear, but, on the contrary, the body begins
to emit a cadaverous odor, which is an infal|lible
mark of death, we may then bury it with|out
&s;cruple.'</P>
<P>We &s;hall afterwards have an opportunity of
mentioning the cu&s;toms of different nations with
regard to funerals, embalming, &amp;c. The great|e&s;t
part, even of the mo&s;t &s;avage people, pay more
attention than we to their departed friends:
What we e&s;teem a ceremony only, they regard
as a primary duty: They re&s;pect their dead;
they clothe them; they &s;peak to them; they
recite their exploits; they prai&s;e their virtues:
But we, who pretend to &s;uperior &s;en&s;ibility, fly
from our dead, and inhumanly abandon them;
we de&s;ire not to &s;ee them; we have neither the
courage nor the inclination to &s;peak of them;
we even avoid such objects or &s;ituations as might
recall the idea of them: We are, therefore, ei|ther
more indifferent, or weaker than &s;ava|ges.</P>
<P><PB N="496" REF="509">
Having thus traced the hi&s;tory of life and
death with regard to the individual, let us now
con&s;ider both in relation to the whole &s;pecies.
Man dies at every age; and, though the dura|tion
of his life be longer than that of mo&s;t ani|mals;
yet it is unque&s;tionably more various and
uncertain. Attempts have lately been made to
a&s;certain the&s;e uncertainties, and, by ob&s;ervations,
to fix &s;ome &s;tandard with regard to the morta|lity
of mankind at different periods of life. If
the&s;e ob&s;ervations were &s;ufficiently numerous
and exact, they would be of great utility in de|termining
the number of people, their increa&s;e,
the con&s;umption of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. Many au|thors
have written with ability on this &s;ubject.
M. de Parcieux, of the academy of &s;ciences, has
lately publi&s;hed an excellent work for regulating
tontins and annuities. But, as his principal ob|ject
was to calculate the mortality of annuitants,
and as &s;uch per&s;ons are particularly pitched up|on
for their apparent &s;trength of con&s;titution,
his calculations cannot be applied to mankind in
general. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, his curious tables
of the mortality of the different orders of re|ligious
mu&s;t be confined to their proper objects.
Hally, Grant, Ker&s;boom, Simp&s;on, &amp;c. have
al&s;o given tables of the mortality of the human
&s;pecies. But, as their ob&s;ervations have been li|mited
to the bills of mortality in a few pari&s;hes
of London, Bre&s;lau, and other large towns, they
can afford little information as to the general
<PB N="497" REF="510">
mortality of mankind. To make complete ta|bels
of this kind, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;crutinize the
pari&s;h-regi&s;ters, not only of London, Paris, &amp;c.
where there is a perpetual ingre&s;s of &s;trangers
and egre&s;s of natives, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of the
country, that, comparing the re&s;ults of both,
general conclu&s;ions may be formed. M. Dupr&eacute;
de St Maur, a member of the French Academy,
has executed this plan upon twelve pari&s;hes in
the country of France, and three in Paris. Ha|ving
obtained his permi&s;&s;ion to publi&s;h his tables,
I do it the more chearfully, as they are the only
calculations by which the probability of human
life in general can be a&s;certained with any de|gree
of certainty.</P>

Many u&s;eful conclu&s;ions might be drawn from
the above tables of M. Dupr&eacute;. But I &s;hall con|fine
my&s;elf to tho&s;e which regard the probabi|lities
of the duration of life. It is ob&s;ervable,
that, in the columns under the years, 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and other round numbers,
as 25, 35, &amp;c. there are, in the country-pari&s;hes,
more deaths than in the preceding or &s;ub&s;equent
columns. This is owing to the ages not being
ju&s;tly regi&s;tered, mo&s;t country-people not being
able to a&s;certain their ages within le&s;s than two
or three years. If they die at 58 or 59, they
are regi&s;tered at 60, and &s;o of other round num|bers.
But this irregularity gives ri&s;e to no great
inconvenience, as it can ea&s;ily be corrected by
the manner in which the numbers &s;ucceed each
other in the tables.</P>
<P>It appears from the tables of the country-pa|ri&s;hes,
that one half of the children die nearly
about the end of the fourth year; but, from the
Paris table, it appears that 16 years are nece&s;|&s;ary
to produce the &s;ame effect. This great dif|ference
proceeds from the general practice of
the Pari&s;ians &s;ending their children to be nur&s;ed
in the country, which nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;es the
number of deaths during the fir&s;t years of in|fancy.
In the following calculation, I have
e&s;timated the probabilities of the duration of life
from a combination of both tables; which mu&s;t,
therefore, make a very near approach to the
truth.</P>

<P><PB N="516" REF="531">
From this table it appears that a new born in|fant,
or a child of 0 age, has an equal chance of
living 8 years; that a child of 1 year will live
33 more; that a child of 2 years will live 38
more; that a man of 20 years will live 33 and
5 months more; and that a man of 30 years
will live 28 more, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It may be farther ob&s;erved, 1. That 7 years is
the age at which the longe&s;t duration of life is
to be expected; for there is then an equal chance
of &s;urviving 42 years 3 months; 2. That, at 12
years, one fourth of life is expired, &s;ince we
have no rea&s;on to hope for above 38 or 39 years
more; 3. That at 28 or 29 years, we have lived
one half of our days, &s;ince there are only 28
more to be expected; and, la&s;tly, That, at the
age of 50, three fourths of life are gone, the
remaining chance extending only to 16 or 17
years longer.</P>
<P>But the&s;e phy&s;ical truths, however mortifying,
may be alleviated by moral con&s;iderations. The
fir&s;t 15 years of our exi&s;tence may be regarded
as nothing: Every thing that pa&s;&s;es during this
long period, is either obliterated from the me|mory,
or has &s;o little connection with the views
and objects which afterwards occupy our atten|tion,
that it cea&s;es entirely to be intere&s;ting.
The train of our ideas, and even the nature of
our exi&s;tence, &s;uffer a total change. We begin
not to live, in a moral &s;en&s;e, till after we have
<PB N="517" REF="532">
learned to arrange our thoughts, to direct them
towards futurity, to a&s;&s;ume a kind of con&s;i&s;tency
of character &s;imilar to that &s;tate at which we
are ultimately de&s;tined to arrive. Con&s;idering
the duration of life in this point of view, which
is the only real one, at the age of 25, we have
only pa&s;&s;ed one fourth of our days, at the age
of 38, one half, and, at the age of 56, three
fourths.</P>
