<HEAD>TO THE

&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU did me honour by permitting me to ad|dre&s;s
to you my Tran&s;lation of your illu|&s;trious
work; and I am now proud to exerci&s;e the
privilege you &s;o politely conferred upon me. The
important Information it contains, and the Eloquence
of its Compo&s;ition, joined to the Ingenuity, Ta&s;te, and
Erudition with which it every where abounds,
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
induced me to think that a Ver&s;ion of it into the
Engli&s;h language, by diffu&s;ing the knowledge of
Nature, would increa&s;e the number of her ad|mirers.
The ta&s;k, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, was
arduous; but your approbation and encourage|ment,
by redoubling my vigour, dimini&s;hed the
difficulty of the labour.</P>
<P>It was with the livelie&s;t plea&s;ure that I re|ceived
your Communications re&s;pecting the valu|able
Performances you have already publi&s;hed,
and concerning tho&s;e undertakings which now
engage your attention and cares. I failed not to
announce to your friends in this country the ad|vantages
which Science and Literature have yet
to expect from you; and I need hardly ob&s;erve,
that their wi&s;hes and my own, for the accom|pli&s;hment
of your purpo&s;es, are in proportion to
the greatne&s;s of your talents.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which the Tran&s;lation met with,
when publi&s;hed &s;eparately in volumes, I imputed
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
to the celebrity of your name, and to the high
value of the original; and the&s;e cau&s;es, I tru&s;t,
will ju&s;tify my anxious attention in laying it be|fore
the Public in its collected and more perfect
form.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,
With the mo&s;t entire re&s;pect,

<HEAD>PREFACE
BY
THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>NATURAL HISTORY is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive,
and perhaps the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and en|tertaining
of all the &s;ciences. It is the chief
fource from which human knowledge is deri|ved.
To recommend the &s;tudy of it from mo|tives
of utility, were to affront the under&s;tand|ing
of the reader. Its importance, accordingly,
in the arts of life, and in &s;toring the mind with
ju&s;t ideas of external objects, as well as of their
relations to the human race, was early percei|ved
by all nations in their progre&s;s from rudene&s;s
to refinement.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the great advantages a|ri&s;ing
from the knowledge of Nature, Ari&s;totle
is the only antient writer on ZOOLOGY who me|rits
attention. In&s;tead of retailing fictions, or
facts founded upon ignorance and credulity, he
inve&s;tigated the relations and di&s;crepances which
connect and di&s;tingui&s;h the various tribes of a|nimals.
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
What had been only a chaos of de|tached,
uncertain, and often fabulous narrations
and de&s;criptions, he reduced into a &s;cientific
form, with a &s;ucce&s;s &s;o amazing, that, to this
hour, no &s;y&s;tematic view of animated beings has
been attempted, the principles of which have
not been adopted from Ari&s;totle's hi&s;tory of ani|mals.
His analogies and di&s;tinctions are taken
not only from the in&s;truments of motion, the
teeth, the eyes, the heart, or other external and
internal organs of the body, to which the atten|tion
of our modern methodi&s;ts has been chiefly
confined, but from magnitude, figure, manners,
faculties and di&s;po&s;itions of mind. He attempt|ed
not to arrange and define every known &s;pe|cies.
This labour he left to men of le&s;s geni|us
and more patience. His work con&s;i&s;ts entire|ly
of philo&s;ophical di&s;&s;ertations on the gene|ral
&s;tructure, manners, and di&s;po&s;itions of ani|mals;
and his particular facts are always employ|ed
to &s;upport the principles which he is endea|vouring
to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Pliny and Aelian, though they had the illu|&s;trious
example of Ari&s;totle before them, produ|ced
nothing but crude collections, without di&s;|covering
much ta&s;te, judgment, or knowledge
of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>From this period, till the voluminous Ge&s;ner
and Aldrovandus appeared, the knowledge of
Nature, like other branches of literature, was in|volved
in the general gloom of ignorance and
&s;uper&s;tition. It was the object of the&s;e authors
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
to ama&s;s every thing that had been &s;aid of ani|mals
by poets, &s;hepherds, grammarians, philo|&s;ophers,
phy&s;icians, and old women. Their pro|lixity,
of cour&s;e, is in&s;ufferable. Their labours,
however, may be regarded as rude quarries,
from which &s;ome valuable materials may be dug
up; but the expence of removing the rubbi&s;h
will, perhaps, overbalance their intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame cla&s;s, with little exception, may
be ranked, Wotton, Belon, Rondeletius, Salvia|nus,
John&s;on, and a multitude of &s;imilar writers.
They all tran&s;cribed, and &s;ometimes abridged,
the labours of their predece&s;&s;ors; but they uni|formly
lo&s;t &s;ight of philo&s;ophy and &s;cience.</P>
<P>This race of phlegmatic writers was &s;uc|ceeded
by our celebrated countrymen Mr Ray
and Mr Willoughby, who were admirers of
Nature, and lamented the &s;lovenly dre&s;s in which
&s;he had been generally exhibited. They
knew the value of her trea&s;ures, and wi&s;h|ed
to &s;how them in their native brilliancy.
They rejected dubious and fictious relations.
They added, from ob&s;ervation and experiment,
many new facts: They arranged animals under
proper cla&s;&s;es and &s;ubdivi&s;ions: They de&s;cribed
with accuracy and preci&s;ion: They pointed out
the importance of the &s;cience, and recommended
the &s;tudy of it by the &s;olidity and clearne&s;s of
their views, and by the brevity and per&s;picuity
of their compo&s;itions. This ta&s;te continued &s;ome
time, and produced the works of Reaumur,
Trembley, Buffon, and &s;imilar publications.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="11">
From beginnings &s;o pro&s;perous much was to
be expected. But the excellency of method was
no &s;ooner recogni&s;ed, than the philo&s;ophy of the
&s;cience was nearly extingui&s;hed by a profu&s;ion
of new terms and arrangements. The ju&s;tly ce|lebrated
Linnaeus, by per&s;evering indu&s;try, join|ed
to the utility of his technical Dictionary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sy&s;tema Naturae, which, with regard to quadrupeds, can be con&s;idered in no other light.</NOTE>,
unfortunately turned the attention of mo&s;t na|turali&s;ts,
though contrary to the learned author's
de&s;ign, from the great views of Nature to the
humble ambition of &s;y&s;tem-making. It is need|le&s;s
to &s;pecify examples. Every philo&s;opher
mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, with regret, that inundation
of methodical di&s;tributions which have &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
appeared during the cour&s;e of the&s;e la&s;t
thirty or forty years. Since the publi&s;hing of
Linnaeus's works, the attention of Naturali&s;ts
has been principally occupied with critici&s;ing
former arrangements, and fabricating new ones.
The philo&s;ophy of the &s;cience has, of cour&s;e,
been almo&s;t totally neglected. It has been ex|hibited
in its mo&s;t forbidding a&s;pect, which has
limited the &s;tudy of it to a few, and tho&s;e often
not of the mo&s;t brilliant talents; for it has been
remarked, that the parade of learning, re&s;ulting
from technical phra&s;es and definitions, allure
&s;ome men to become what is called <HI>great natu|rali&s;ts,</HI>
who&s;e chief knowledge of Nature con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="ix" REF="12">
in the knack of being able to name, with
facility, a great number of her productions.</P>
<P>This propen&s;ity toward multiplying metho|dical
di&s;tributions, and di&s;puting about their re|&s;pective
merits, has brought much obloquy on
the &s;cience of Nature. Men of &s;en&s;e perceive
the folly of di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concerning the local &s;i|tuation
of an animal in a book. They con&s;ider
the authors as learned triflers; and, what is
wor&s;e, they are apt to regard a &s;ubject, which
affords no better entertainment or information,
as barren and unprofitable. To no other &s;ource
are to be a&s;cribed the following &s;entiments, &s;o
frequently expre&s;&s;ed by men of no incon&s;ide|rable
talents: 'That natural hi&s;torians have &s;el|dom
di&s;covered exten&s;ive views; that they
confine their chief attention to the mere tech|nical
part of the &s;cience; that they rarely take
notice of manners and in&s;tincts, or the cau&s;es
and oeconomy of animal action; and that they
never pur&s;ue the&s;e great and u&s;eful objects
with a degree of ta&s;te and philo&s;ophical ac|curacy,
proportioned to the importance of the
&s;ubject.' The&s;e &s;trictures are common: It were
to be wi&s;hed that they had no foundation in
truth.</P>
<P>In natural hi&s;tory, two ends only can be at|tained
by &s;y&s;tem. Both of them are u&s;eful,
but extremely different in their kinds. Sy&s;tem
may be employed either to facilitate the di&s;tinc|tion
<PB N="x" REF="13">
of objects, or to a&s;certain their relations in
the &s;cale of being.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;pecies of &s;y&s;tem, it is obvious, mu&s;t
con&s;i&s;t entirely of a &s;eries of external or inter|nal
characters. It is of little moment, whe|ther
the objects ranked under particular OR|DERS
be mutually connected; becau&s;e, if we
may judge from the many laborious, but a|bortive
attempts which have been made, Na|ture
&s;eems not to have expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch con|nections
in characters recogni&s;able by our &s;en&s;es.
A &s;y&s;tem &s;o limited in its principles and de&s;ign,
can never a&s;&s;ume any other form than that of a
technical index or dictionary. If the general
and particular characters be &s;o marked, that a
&s;tudent, after learning the divi&s;ions and language
of the author, can inve&s;tigate the proper names
of the objects pre&s;ented to him, then is this &s;y|&s;tem
perfect; becau&s;e its &s;ole and primary in|tention
is fulfilled.</P>
<P>Were every naturali&s;t of the &s;ame &s;entiments
with regard to this point, many incumbrances,
which now load the &s;cience, would be removed;
the tyro would not be di&s;gu&s;ted and retarded by
an infinity of &s;ynonimes; natural hi&s;tory would
acquire a more &s;imple and intelligible form; and
the number of its votaries would &s;oon be aug|mented.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies of &s;y&s;tem is more elevated
and &s;ublime. But, as it includes the whole phi|lo&s;ophy
of Nature, it requires a depth of judg|ment,
a &s;uperiority of genius, an extent of know|ledge,
<PB N="xi" REF="14">
which are &s;eldom united in the &s;ame
per&s;on. Natural objects are wonderfully diver|&s;ified
in their &s;tructure, oeconomy, and faculties.
But, in the&s;e, as well as in many other circum|&s;tances,
they are no le&s;s wonderfully connected.
Here, then, are foundations for con&s;tructing the
&s;y&s;tem of Nature. To mark the di&s;tinctions,
to inve&s;tigate the relations, to a&s;certain the great
chain that unites the numerous tribes which
people and adorn the univer&s;e, would demand
talents &s;uperior, perhaps, to tho&s;e of humanity.
We ought not, however, to de&s;pair. Hardly
any bounds can be &s;et to the combined force of
different minds acting &s;ucce&s;&s;ively upon the &s;ame
&s;ubject. Something has already been done.
More may in time appear: Nature, in &s;ome fu|ture
period, may happily unite Philo&s;ophy and
Natural Hi&s;tory, a phaenomenon which has hi|therto
been but partially exhibited.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e authors, whether antient or mo|dern,
who have contributed to unfold the phi|lo&s;ophy
of Natural Hi&s;tory, the COUNT DE
BUFFON holds the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed rank.
This learned and eloquent writer has introduced
into his &s;ubjects a greater variety of di&s;qui&s;ition,
and given more comprehen&s;ive views of Nature,
than any preceeding or contemporary hi&s;torian.
His facts are, in general, collected with judg|ment
and fidelity; and his rea&s;onings and in|ferences
are not only bold and ingenious, but
adorned with all the beauties of expre&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="xii" REF="15">
all the charms of novelty. They every where
lead to reflections which are momentous and in|tere&s;ting.
They expand the mind and bani&s;h
prejudices. They create an elevation of thought,
and cheri&s;h an ardour of inquiry. They open
many great and delightful pro&s;pects of the oeco|nomy
of Nature, of the alterations and acci|dents
to which &s;he is liable, of the cau&s;es of her
improvement or degeneration, and of the gene|ral
relations that connect the whole, and give
ri&s;e to all the diver&s;ities which characteri&s;e and
con&s;titute particular orders of exi&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding the &s;plendid talents of the Count de Buf|fon, the tran&s;lator thinks it incumbent upon him to caution the reader again&s;t a favourite and dangerous doctrine which the author, in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of his work, &s;eems too anxious to incl|cate. Like many of our modern French writers, he endeavours to bani&s;h final cau&s;es from the univer&s;e. It is a &s;ubject of much regret, that philo&s;ophers, the per&s;ons who are be&s;t qualified to unfold the my&s;teries of Nature, in&s;tead of comforting and in|forming mankind, by &s;howing that her mo&s;t ho&s;tile forms are real expre&s;&s;ions of benevolence, and that the great chain of cau&s;es and effects, whether in the natural or moral world, are all intended to promote general felicity, &s;hould &s;o frequently &s;tretch their fancy for the perver&s;e purpo&s;e of throwing a gloom over all her productions, and of excluding de&s;ign from the ope|rations of her great Author. Becau&s;e they cannot comprehend the &s;upreme Being, becau&s;e they are unable to perceive his mode of acting upon matter, they, therefore, &s;eem willing to di&s;believe his exi&s;tence. They have a partial knowledge of &s;ome of the properties of matter. The&s;e properties they con&s;ider as the only &s;prings which produce and regulate all the movements exhibit|ed both in animate and inanimate beings; and hence they ra&s;h|ly conclude, that &s;uperior powers are unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;This is not a proper place for rea&s;oning. It &s;hall only be remarked, that a univer&s;e without de&s;ign and intelligence, is more incompre|hen&s;ible than an active machine without a moving principle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="16">
The original work, of which a tran&s;lation is
now attempted, was undertaken and carried in|to
execution under the munificent encourage|ment
of a great monarch. The de&s;ign was to
compo&s;e a hi&s;tory which &s;hould record not only
every phaenomenon in the univer&s;e that was al|ready
known; but to examine, de&s;cribe, and
delineate from the life, all the animals which
could be procured by royal influence. A plan
&s;o exten&s;ive required the joint operation of, at
lea&s;t, two per&s;on; the one to compo&s;e the hi|&s;torical
part, the other to di&s;&s;ect and minutely
de&s;cribe every animal, both native and foreign,
that &s;hould be obtained. The literary character
and philo&s;ophic talents of the COUNT DE BUF|FON
pointed him out for the execution of the
fir&s;t department, and the acutene&s;s and anato|mical
&s;kill of M. DAUBENTON, recommended
him for that of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Three volumes of this great work were given
to the public in the year 1749. The&s;e volumes
exhibited &s;uch di&s;plays of learning, ta&s;te, genius,
and eloquence, as procured to the author un|common
admiration, and excited a &s;trong and
general de&s;ire for the completion of his plan;
which however, from various cau&s;es, was not
accompli&s;hed till the year 1767.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="17">
The COUNT DE BUFFON, in the year 1776,
favoured the world with a &s;upplementary vo|lume
to his hi&s;tory of quadrupeds, which, be&s;ide
an ingenious di&s;&s;ertation on Mules, contains re|lations
and figures of &s;everal new animals, and
valuable additions to mo&s;t of tho&s;e de&s;cribed in
the original publication.</P>
<P>It would be improper to enter more minutely
into the hi&s;tory or contents of this magnificent
work. Such is the fertility of the author's ge|nius,
and &s;uch his ardour for philo&s;ophic inqui|ry,
that, when treating of the mo&s;t common a|nimals,
he often a&s;toni&s;hes his reader with the
profoundne&s;s of his remarks, and the beauty of
his analogical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, though the publication was a great ac|qui&s;i&s;ition
to literature; yet the high price of
SIXTEEN GUINEAS, which was an unavoidable
con&s;equence of its &s;plendour, and of the prodi|gious
number of its elegant engravings, confined
its utility to men of opulence. Sen&s;ible of this
inconvenience, the COUNT DE BUFFON, a few
years ago, publi&s;hed an edition in 12<HI>mo</HI>; and,
to bring it within the reach of common purcha|&s;ers,
he excluded from it the long and minute
anatomical di&s;&s;ections and men&s;urations.</P>
<P>After this &s;hort &s;ketch of the COUNT DE
BUFFON's Hi&s;tory of Nature, it may &s;eem &s;trange
that no decent tran&s;lation of it has hitherto ap|peared
in the Engli&s;h language. To &s;uch an
undertaking, the great expence of the engravings
<PB N="xv" REF="18">
was one &s;olid objection. Another aro&s;e from
the va&s;t variety of learning employed by the
author. When to the&s;e are added the exube|rance
of his fancy, the eloquence and force of
his diction, the delicacy and acutene&s;s of his di&s;|qui&s;itions,
we &s;hould rather wonder how any
man could reconcile him&s;elf to a ta&s;k &s;o labo|rious,
and which required the union of &s;uch di|ver&s;ified
talents.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>The tran&s;lation which is now &s;ubmitted to the
judgment and candour of the public, was projec|ted
and begun about &s;even years ago. The tran|&s;lator,
un&s;u&s;picious of rivals, proceeded with de|liberation.
When the ingenious Dr Gold&s;mith's
Natural Hi&s;tory appeared, &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance was
expected, as he tran&s;lates many pa&s;&s;ages from
Buffon. But this expectation was abortive; for
Dr Gold&s;mith, though he follows our author in
general, omits and patches according to his own
fancy, &s;eldom giving any article entire, or in or|der,
and never exerting tho&s;e talents as a tran|&s;lator
which he employs &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully in his o|riginal
compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Dr Gold&s;mith's Natural Hi&s;tory, however,
&s;ugge&s;ted to &s;ome book&s;ellers the idea of a cheap
tran&s;lation of Buffon's Hi&s;tory of Quadrupeds.
The pre&s;ent tran&s;lator, knowing the difficulty and
labour of his undertaking, was naturally alarm|ed
<PB N="xvi" REF="19">
when he &s;aw this new publication announced.
But, upon the peru&s;al of it, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to
find, that, in many places, it was nearly a literal
tran&s;cript of the pa&s;&s;ages which Dr Gold&s;mith

mere literary impo&s;ition. It is painful to mark
the blunders of other men; and, were it not for
a regard to literature, and to the reputation of
the COUNT DE BUFFON, no notice &s;hould have
been taken of this &s;trange performance. But
the examples given in the notes will fully ju&s;ti|fy
the &s;eeming &s;everity of the&s;e &s;trictures.</P>
<P>The following tran&s;lation comprehends what
is contained in the original fifteen volumes in
quarto, together with the &s;upplementary volume
to the hi&s;tory of quadrupeds, excepting the de|&s;cription
of the King's cabinet, the dry and un|intere&s;ting
anatomical di&s;&s;ections and men&s;ura|tions,
which can be of little u&s;e but to profe&s;&s;ed
anatomi&s;ts, and have been properly omitted by
the author in the la&s;t Paris edition. The me|thod
of &s;tudying Natural Hi&s;tory; the repre|hen&s;ion
of methodical di&s;tributions; and the
mode of de&s;cribing animals, are likewi&s;e omitted.
The chief intention of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es is to ridi|cule
the authors of &s;y&s;tematic arrangements, and
particularly the late ingenuous and indefatigable
Sir Charles Linnaeus, who&s;e zeal and labours in
promoting the inve&s;tigation of natural objects
merit the highe&s;t applau&s;e. There is a &s;tronger
rea&s;on for this omi&s;&s;ion: The &s;ame remarks and
arguments are, perhaps, too frequently repeated
in the hi&s;tory of particular animals.</P>
<P>To render this Engli&s;h ver&s;ion more valuable,
the tran&s;lator has added &s;hort di&s;tinctive de&s;crip|tions
to each &s;pecies of quadrupeds. For the&s;e
<PB N="xx" REF="23">
he has been indebted to the labours of the learn|ed
and ingenious Mr Pennant, who has al&s;o,
with that politene&s;s, and di&s;intere&s;ted regard to
&s;cience, which ought always to adorn the gentle|man
and the &s;cholar, frankly permitted the en|graving
of &s;everal new animals from his excel|lent
Synop&s;is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Synop&s;is of quadrupeds, by Thomas Pennant, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> 8vo, 1771.</NOTE>. Be&s;ide the&s;e u&s;eful additions,

given by Linnacus, Klein, Bri&s;&s;on, and
other naturali&s;ts, are &s;ubjoined to the de&s;crip|tion

<P>Where the author commits mi&s;takes, or where

&s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in notes: But he has &s;eldom ta|ken
any notice of peculiar theories or doctrines.
The&s;e mu&s;t re&s;t upon the facts and arguments
employed by the author. It was not the inten|tion
of the tran&s;lator to write a commentary upon
his original.</P>
<P>The great variety of &s;ubjects di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the
Count de Buffon, has already been mentioned.
It is unnece&s;&s;ary to remark, that every &s;ubject
demands a peculiar &s;tyle. A bare enumera|tion
of facts, or de&s;criptions of the dimen&s;ions,
figure, and colour of animals, admit of no other
ornament than that of per&s;picuity. Topics of
philo&s;ophy and argument require a higher and
<PB N="xxi" REF="24">
more figurative expre&s;&s;ion: And addre&s;&s;es to
the pa&s;&s;ions, and the finer feelings of men, give
full &s;cope to the exerci&s;e of genius and ta&s;te. Of
the&s;e different &s;pecies of writing, the examples
are numerous in the works of the COUNT DE
BUFFON. The tran&s;lator has endeavoured to
follow the original, as far as his abilities would
permit. The degree of &s;ucce&s;s he has attained
mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the impartial determination
of the public. He &s;hall only &s;ay, that his ap|prehen&s;ions,
though he is con&s;cious of no vo|luntary
negligence, are much greater than his
hopes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<P> In the dimen&s;ions of animals, the tran|&s;lator
has retained the French mea&s;ures. The
differences between the foot or inch of England and
France are &s;o incon&s;iderable, when applied to in|dividual
animals, that he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary
to reduce them to the preci&s;e Engli&s;h &s;tandard,
e&s;pecially as the dimen&s;ions are Engli&s;h in the
de&s;criptions added in the notes.</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY AND THEORY
OF THE
EARTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE figure of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ub&s;equent proofs of the theory of the earth, art. I.</NOTE>, its motions, or
the external relations which &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween
it and the other parts of the univer&s;e, be|long
not to our pre&s;ent inquiry. It is the inter|nal
&s;tructure of the globe, its form and manner
of exi&s;tence, that we here propo&s;e to examine.
The general hi&s;tory of the earth ought to precede
that of its productions. Details of particular
facts relating to the oeconomy and manners of
animals, or to the culture and vegetation of
plants, are not, perhaps, &s;o much the objects of
natural hi&s;tory, as general deductions from the
ob&s;ervations that have been made upon the dif|ferent
materials of which the earth it&s;elf is com|po&s;ed;
as its heights, depths, and inequalities;
the motions of the &s;ea, the direction of moun|tains,
the &s;ituation of rocks and quarries, the ra|pidity
and effects of currents in the ocean, &amp;c.
<PB N="2" REF="27">
This is the hi&s;tory of nature at large, and of her
principal operations, by which every other infe|rior
or le&s;s general effect is produced. The the|ory
of the&s;e effects con&s;titutes what may be cal|led
the primary &s;cience, upon which a preci&s;e
knowledge of particular appearances, as well as
of terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tances, &s;olely depends. This
&s;pecies of &s;cience may be con&s;idered as apper|taining
to phy&s;ics; but, is not all phy&s;ical know|ledge,
where &s;y&s;tem is excluded, a part of the
hi&s;tory of nature?</P>
<P>In &s;ubjects of an exten&s;ive kind, the relations
of which it is difficult to trace, where &s;ome
facts are but partially known, and others ob|&s;cure,
it is more ea&s;y to form a fanciful &s;y&s;tem,
than to e&s;tabli&s;h a rational theory. Thus the
theory of the earth has never hitherto been
treated but in a vague and hypothetical manner.
I &s;hall, therefore, exhibit only a cur&s;ory view
of the notions of &s;ome authors who have writ|ten
upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hypothe&s;is I &s;hall mention is more
con&s;picuous for its ingenuity than &s;olidity. It
is the production of an Engli&s;h a&s;tronomer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whi&s;ton; See the proofs, art. II.</NOTE>,
who was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of Sir I&s;aac
Newton's &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy. Convinced
that every po&s;&s;ible event depends upon the mo|tions
and direction of the &s;tars, he endeavours
to prove, by means of mathematical calculations,
<PB N="3" REF="28">
that all the changes this earth has undergone
have been produced by the tail of a comet.</P>
<P>For another hypothe&s;is we are indebted to a
heterodox divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet. See proofs, art. III.</NOTE>, who&s;e brain was &s;o fully im|pregnated
with poetical illu&s;ions, that he ima|gined
he had &s;een the univer&s;e created. After
telling us the &s;tate of the earth when it fir&s;t
&s;prung from nothing, what changes have been
introduced by the deluge, what the earth has been,
and what it now is, he a&s;&s;umes the prophetic
&s;tyle, and predicts what will be its condition af|ter
the de&s;truction of the human kind.</P>
<P>A third writer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Woodward. See proofs, art. IV,</NOTE>, a man of more exten&s;ive ob|&s;ervation
than the two former, but equally crude
and confu&s;ed in his ideas, explains the principal
appearances of the globe by the aid of an im|men&s;e
aby&s;s in the bowels of the earth; which,
in his e&s;timation, is nothing but a thin cru&s;t in|clo&s;ing
this va&s;t ocean of fluid matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e un&s;table hypothe&s;es are all con&s;tructed
on tottering foundations. The ideas they con|tain
are indi&s;tinct, the facts are confounded, and
the whole is amotely jumble of phy&s;ics and fa|ble.
They, accordingly, have never been a|dopted
but by people who embrace opinions
without examination, and who, incapable of
di&s;tingui&s;hing the degrees of probability, are
more deeply impre&s;&s;ed with marvellous chime|ras
than with the force of truth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="29">
Our ideas on this &s;ubject will be le&s;s extraor|dinary,
and may appear unimportant when com|pared
with the grand &s;y&s;tems ju&s;t mentioned.
But it ought not to be forgotten, that it is the
bu&s;ine&s;s of an hi&s;torian to de&s;cribe, not to in|vent;
that no gratuitous &s;uppo&s;itions are to be
admitted in &s;ubjects that depend upon fact and
ob&s;ervation; and that, in hi&s;torical compo&s;itions,
the imagination cannot be employed, unle&s;s for
the purpo&s;e of combining ob&s;ervations, of ren|dering
facts more general, and of forming a
connected whole, which pre&s;ents to the mind
clear ideas, and probable conjectures: I &s;ay, pro|bable;
for it is impo&s;&s;ible to give demon&s;trative
evidence on this &s;ubject. Demon&s;tration is con|fined
to the mathematical &s;ciences. Our know|ledge
in phy&s;ics and natural hi&s;tory depends en|tirely
on experience, and is limited to the me|thod
of rea&s;oning by induction.</P>
<P>With regard to the hi&s;tory of the earth, there|fore,
we &s;hall begin with &s;uch facts as have been
univer&s;ally acknowledged in all ages, not omit|ting
tho&s;e additional truths that have fallen with|in
our own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The &s;urface of this immen&s;e globe exhibits to
our ob&s;ervation heights, depths, plains, &s;eas,
mar&s;hes, rivers, caverns, gulfs, volcano's; and,
on a cur&s;ory view, we can di&s;cover, in the di&s;|po&s;ition
of the&s;e objects, neither order nor re|gularity.
If we penetrate into the bowels of the
earth, we find metals, minerals, &s;tones, bitumens,
<PB N="5" REF="30">
&s;ands, earths, waters, and matter of every kind,
placed as it were by mere accident, and without
any apparent de&s;ign. Upon a nearer and more
attentive in&s;pection, we di&s;cover &s;unk moun|tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Senec. Quae&s;t. lib. 6. cap. 21. Strab. Geog. lib. 1. Oro&s;ius, lib. 2. cap. 18. Plin. lib. 2. cap. 19. Hi&s;t. de l'acad, des &s;ciences, ann&eacute;e 1708, p. 23.</NOTE>,
caverns filled up, &s;hattered rocks, whole
countries &s;wallowed up, new i&s;lands emerged
from the ocean, heavy &s;ub&s;tances placed above
light ones, hard bodies inclo&s;ed within &s;oft bo|dies;
in a word, we find matter in every form,
dry and humid, warm and cold, &s;olid and brittle,
blended in a chaos of confu&s;ion, which can be
compared to nothing but a heap of rubbi&s;h, or
the ruins of a world.</P>
<P>The&s;e ruins, however, we inhabit with per|fect
&s;ecurity. The different generations of men,
of animals, and of plants, &s;ucceed one another
without interruption: The productions of the
earth are &s;ufficient for their &s;u&s;tenance; the mo|tions
of the &s;ea, and the currents of the air, are
regulated by fixed laws<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the proofs, art. XIV.</NOTE>; the returns of the &s;ea|&s;ons
are uniform, and the rigours of winter in|variably
give place to the verdure of the &s;pring.
With regard to us, every thing has the appear|ance
of order: The earth, formerly a chaos, is
now a tranquil, an harmonious, a delightful ha|bitation,
where all is animated and governed by
&s;uch amazing di&s;plays of power and intelligence,
<PB N="6" REF="31">
as fill us with admiration, and elevate our minds
to the contemplation of the great Creator.</P>
<P>But, let us not decide precipitantly concern|ing
the irregularities on the &s;urface of the earth,
and the apparent di&s;order in its bowels: We &s;hall
&s;oon perceive the utility, and even the nece&s;&s;ity
of this arrangement. With a little attention,
we &s;hall perhaps di&s;cover an order of which we
had no conception, and general relations which
cannot be apprehended by a &s;light examination.
Our knowledge, indeed, with regard to this &s;ub|ject,
mu&s;t always be limited. We are entirely
unacquainted with many parts of the &s;urface of
this globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. VI.</NOTE>, and have but very partial ideas con|cerning
the bottom of the ocean, which, in ma|ny
places, has never been &s;ounded. We can
only penetrate the rind of the earth. The
greate&s;t caverns<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. tran&s;. abridged, vol. ii. p. 323.</NOTE>, the deepe&s;t mines<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Boyle's works, vol. iii. p. 232.</NOTE>, de&s;cend
not above the 8th thou&s;andth part of its diame|ter.
Our judgment is therefore confined to the
upper &s;tratum, or mere &s;uperficial part. We
know, indeed, that, bulk for bulk, the earth is
four times heavier than the &s;un: We likewi&s;e
know the proportion its weight bears to that of
the other planets. But &s;till this e&s;timation is
only relative. We have no &s;tandard. Of the
real weight of the materials we are &s;o ignorant,
that the internal part of the globe may be either
<PB N="7" REF="32">
a void &s;pace, or it may be compo&s;ed of matter
a thou&s;and times heavier than gold. Neither is
there any method of making farther di&s;coveries
on this &s;ubject. It is even with difficulty that
rational conjectures can be formed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t therefore confine our&s;elves to an ac|curate
examination and de&s;cription of the &s;urface
of the earth, and of &s;uch incon&s;iderable depths
as we have been able to penetrate. The fir&s;t
object which attracts the attention, is that im|men&s;e
body of water with which the greate&s;t
part of the globe is covered. The&s;e waters oc|cupy
the lowe&s;t grounds; their &s;urface is always
level; and, notwith&s;tanding their uniform ten|dency
to equilibrium and re&s;t, they are kept in
perpetual agitation by a powerful agent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XII.</NOTE>, which
counteracts their natural tranquility, which com|municates
to them a regular periodic motion, al|ternately
elevating and depre&s;&s;ing their waves,
and which produces a concu&s;&s;ion or vibration
in the whole ma&s;s, even to the mo&s;t profound
depths. This motion of the water is coeval with
time, and will endure as long as the &s;un and
and moon, which are the cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>In examining the bottom of the &s;ea, we per|ceive
it to be equally irregular as the &s;urface of

<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e grand objects, the ocean pre&s;ents
us with myriads of animated beings, almo&s;t in|finite
in variety: Some clothed in light &s;cales,
&s;wim with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s; others, loaded
with thick &s;hells, trail heavily along, leaving
their traces in the &s;and: To others nature has
given &s;ins re&s;embling wings, with which they
&s;upport them&s;elves in the air, and fly before
their enemies to con&s;iderable di&s;tances. La&s;tly,
the &s;ea gives birth to other animals, that, totally
deprived of motion, live and die immoveably
fixed to the &s;ame rocks: All, however, find a|bundance
of food in this fluid element. The
bottom of the ocean, and the &s;helving &s;ides of
rocks, produce plentiful crops of plants of many
different &s;pecies; its &s;oil is compo&s;ed of &s;and,
gravel, rocks, and &s;hells; in &s;ome places, it is a fine
clay, in others, a compact earth; and, in gene|ral,
<PB N="10" REF="35">
the bottom of the &s;ea has an exact re&s;em|blance
to the dry land which we inhabit.</P>
<P>Let us next take a view of the land: What
prodigious differences take place in different
climates? What a variety of &s;oils! what inequa|lities
in the &s;urface! But, upon a more attentive
ob&s;ervation, we will perceive, that the great
chains of mountains lie nearer the equator than
the poles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. IX.</NOTE>; that, in the Old Continent, their di|rection
is more from ea&s;t to we&s;t than from
&s;outh to north; and that, on the contrary, in

to &s;outh than from ea&s;t to we&s;t. But, what is
&s;till more remarkable, the figure and direction
of the&s;e mountains, which have a mo&s;t irregular
appearance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. art. IX XII.</NOTE>, corre&s;pond &s;o wonderfully, that the
<HI>prominent</HI> angles of one mountain are con&s;tant|ly

mountain<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lettres Phil. de Bourguet, p. 181.</NOTE>, and of equal dimen&s;ions,
whether they be &s;eparated by an exten&s;ive plain,
or a &s;mall valley. I have further remarked, that
oppo&s;ite hills are always nearly of the &s;ame
height; and that mountains generally occupy
the middle of continents, i&s;lands, and promon|tories,
dividing them by their greate&s;t lengths<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Varen, Geog. p. 69.</NOTE>.
I have likewi&s;e traced the cour&s;es of the princi|pal
rivers, and find that their direction is near|ly
perpendicular to the &s;ea-coa&s;ts into which
they empty them&s;elves; and that, during the
<PB N="11" REF="36">
greate&s;t part of their cour&s;es, they follow the
direction of the mountains from which they de|rive
their origin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art X.</NOTE>. The &s;ea-coa&s;ts are general|ly
bordered with rocks of marble, and other hard
&s;tones, or rather with earth and &s;and accumu|lated
by the waters of the &s;ea, or brought down
and depo&s;ited by rivers. In oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts, &s;epa|rated
only by &s;mall arms of the &s;ea, the different

I find that volcano's never exi&s;t but in high
mountains<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. art. XVI.</NOTE>; that a great number of them
are entirely extingui&s;hed; that &s;ome are connec|ted
to others by &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;ages, and their
eruptions not unfrequently happen at the &s;ame
time<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Kircher Mund. &s;ubter. in prae&s;.</NOTE>. There are &s;imilar communications be|tween
certain lakes and &s;eas. Some rivers &s;ud|denly
di&s;appear<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Varen. Geog. p. 43.</NOTE>, and &s;eem to precipitate them|&s;elves
into the bowels of the earth. We likewi&s;e
find certain mediterranean or inland &s;eas, that con|&s;tantly
receive, from many and great rivers, pro|digious
quantities of water, without any aug|mentation
of their bounds, probably di&s;charging
by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages all tho&s;e extraneous
&s;upplies. It is likewi&s;e ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h lands
which have been long inhabited, from tho&s;e new
countries where the earth appears in a rude &s;tate,
where the rivers are full of cataracts, where the
land is either nearly overflowed with water, or
burnt up with drought, and where every place
<PB N="12" REF="37">
capable of producing trees is totally covered with
wood.</P>
<P>Proceeding in our examination, we di&s;cover
that the upper &s;tratum of the earth is univer&s;al|ly
the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VII.</NOTE>; that this &s;ub&s;tance,
from which all animals and vegetables derive
their growth and nouri&s;hment, is nothing but
a compo&s;ition of the decayed parts of animal
and vegetable bodies, reduced into &s;uch &s;mall
particles that their former organic &s;tate is not
di&s;tingui&s;hable. Penetrating a little deeper, we
find the real earth, beds of &s;and, lime-&s;tone, clay,
&s;hells, marble, gravel, chalk, &amp;c. The&s;e beds
are always parallel to each other<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. and Woodward, p. 41. &amp;c.</NOTE>, and of the
&s;ame thickne&s;s through their whole extent. In
neighbouring hills, beds or &s;trata of the &s;ame
materials are uniformly found at the &s;ame le|vels,
though the hills be &s;eparated by deep and
large valleys. Strata of every kind, even of the
mo&s;t &s;olid rocks, are uniformly divided by per|pendicular
fi&s;&s;ures<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VIII.</NOTE>. Shells, &s;keletons of fi&s;hes,
marine plants, &amp;c. are often found in the bowels
of the earth, and on the top of mountains<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VIII.</NOTE>, even
at the greate&s;t di&s;tances from the &s;ea. The&s;e
&s;hells, fi&s;hes, and plants, are exactly &s;imilar to
tho&s;e which exi&s;t in the ocean. Petrified &s;hells
are to be met with, almo&s;t every wher, in
prodigious quantities: They are not only in|clo&s;ed
in rocks of marble and lime-&s;tone, as
<PB N="13" REF="38">
well as in earths and clays, but are actually in|corporated
and filled with the very &s;ub&s;tances
in which they are inclo&s;ed. In fine, I am con|vinced,
by repeated ob&s;ervation, that marbles,
lime-&s;tones, chalks, marles, clays, &s;and, and al|mo&s;t
all terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tances, wherever &s;itua|ted,
are full of &s;hells and other &s;poils of the
ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Steno, Woodward, Ray, Bourguet, Scheuchzer, Phil. Tran&s;. Mem. de I'Acad. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having enumerated the&s;e facts, let us try
what conclu&s;ions can be drawn from them.</P>
<P>The changes which the earth has undergone,
during the la&s;t two or three thou&s;and years,
are incon&s;iderable, when compared with the
great revolutions which mu&s;t have taken place
in tho&s;e ages that immediately &s;ucceeded the
creation. For, as terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tances could
not acquire &s;olidity but by the continued action
of gravity, it is ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, that the
&s;urface of the earth was at fir&s;t much &s;ofter than
it is now; and, con&s;equently, that the &s;ame
cau&s;es which at pre&s;ent produce but &s;light, and
almo&s;t imperceptible alterations during the cour&s;e
of many centuries, were then capable of produ|cing
very great revolutions in a few years. It
appears, indeed, to be an uncontravertible fact,
that the dry land which we now inhabit, and
even the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t mountains,
were formerly covered with the waters of the
&s;ea; for &s;hells, and other marine bodies, are
<PB N="14" REF="39">
&s;till found upon the very tops of mountains. It
likewi&s;e appears, that the waters of the &s;ea have
remained for a long track of years upon the &s;ur|face
of the earth; becau&s;e, in many places, &s;uch
immen&s;e banks of &s;hells have been di&s;covered,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;o great a multitude of ani|mals
could exi&s;t at the &s;ame time. This circum|&s;tance
&s;eems likewi&s;e to prove, that, although
the materials on the &s;urface of the earth were
then &s;oft, and, of cour&s;e, ea&s;ily di&s;united,
moved, and tran&s;ported, by the waters; yet
the&s;e tran&s;portations could not be &s;uddenly ef|fected.
They mu&s;t have been gradual and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive,
as &s;ea-bodies are &s;ometimes found
more than 1000 feet below the &s;urface. Such
a thickne&s;s of earth or of &s;tone could not be ac|cumulated
in a &s;hort time. Although it &s;hould
be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, at the deluge, all the &s;hells
were tran&s;ported from the bottom of the ocean,
and depo&s;ited upon the dry land; yet, be&s;ide the
difficulty of e&s;tabli&s;hing this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is
clear, that, as &s;hells are found incorporated in
marble, and in the rocks of the highe&s;t moun|tains,
we mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e, that all the&s;e
marbles and rocks were formed at the &s;ame
time, and at the very in&s;tant when the deluge
took place; and that, before this grand revolu|tion,
there were neither mountains, nor marbles,
nor rocks, nor clays, nor matter of any kind &s;i|milar
to what we are now acquainted with,
as they all, with few exceptions, contain &s;hells,
<PB N="15" REF="40">
and other productions of the ocean. Be&s;ide, at
the time of the univer&s;al deluge, the earth mu&s;t
have acquired a con&s;iderable degree of &s;olidity,
by the action of gravity for more than &s;ixteen
centuries. During the &s;hort time the deluge
la&s;ted, it is, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible, that the waters
&s;hould have overturned and di&s;&s;olved the whole
&s;urface of the earth, to the greate&s;t depths that
mankind have been able to penetrate.</P>
<P>But, without in&s;i&s;ting longer on this point,
which &s;hall afterwards be more fully canva&s;&s;ed,
I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to known and e&s;tabli&s;hed
facts. It is certain, that the waters of the &s;ea
have, at &s;ome period or other, remained for a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages upon what we now know to
be dry land; and, con&s;equently, that the va&s;t
continents of A&s;ia, Europe, Africa, and Ameri|ca,
were then the bottom of an immen&s;e ocean,
replete with every thing which the pre&s;ent ocean
produces. It is likewi&s;e certain, that the diffe|rent
&s;trata of the earth are horizontal, and pa|rallel
to each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. VII.</NOTE>. This parallel &s;ituation
mu&s;t, therefore, be owing to the operation of
the waters, which have gradually accumulated
the different materials, and given them the &s;ame
po&s;ition which water it&s;elf invariably a&s;&s;umes.
The horizontal po&s;ition of &s;trata is almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al:
In plains, the &s;trata are exactly horizon|tal.
It is only in the mountains that they are
inclined to the horizon; becau&s;e they have ori|ginally
<PB N="16" REF="41">
been formed by &s;ediments depo&s;ited up|on
an inclined ba&s;e. Now, I maintain, that the&s;e
&s;trata mu&s;t have been gradually formed, and are
not the effect of any &s;udden revolution; becau&s;e
nothing is more frequent than &s;trata compo&s;ed
of heavy materials placed above light ones,
which never could have happened, if, according
to &s;ome authors, the whole had been blended
and di&s;&s;olved by the deluge, and afterwards pre|cipitated.
On this &s;uppo&s;ition, every thing
would have had a different a&s;pect from what
now appears. The heavie&s;t bodies would
have de&s;cended fir&s;t, and every &s;tratum would
have had a &s;ituation corre&s;ponding to its &s;pecific
gravity. In this ca&s;e, we &s;hould not have &s;een
&s;olid rocks or metals placed above light &s;and,
nor clay under coal.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance demands our attention.
No other cau&s;e than the motion and &s;ediments
or water could po&s;&s;ibly produce the regular po|&s;ition
of the various &s;trata of which the &s;uperfi|cial
part of this earth is compo&s;ed. The highe&s;t
mountains con&s;i&s;t of parallel &s;trata, as well as
the lowe&s;t valleys. Of cour&s;e, the formation of
mountains cannot be imputed to the &s;hocks of
earthquakes, or to the eruptions of volcano's.
Such &s;mall eminences as have been rai&s;ed by
volcano's or convul&s;ions of the earth, in&s;tead of
being compo&s;ed of parallel &s;trata, are mere ma&s;|&s;es
of weighty material, blended together in the
<PB N="17" REF="42">
utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVII.</NOTE>. But this parallel and hori|zontal
po&s;ition of &s;trata mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the
operation of a uniform and con&s;tant cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We are, therefore, obliged to conclude, from
repeated and uncontrovertible facts and ob&s;er|vations,
that the dry and habitable part of the
earth has remained for a long time under the
waters of the &s;ea, and mu&s;t have undergone the
&s;ame fluctuation and changes which are pre&s;ent|ly
going on at the bottom of the ocean. To
di&s;cover, therefore, what has formerly happen|ed
to the dry land, let us examine what pa&s;&s;es
in the bottom of the &s;ea; and we &s;hall &s;oon be
enabled to make &s;ome rational conclu&s;ions with
regard to the external figure, and internal con|&s;titution
of the earth.</P>
<P>The ocean, from the creation of the &s;olar &s;y|&s;tem,
has been con&s;tantly &s;ubject to a regular
flux and reflux. This motion, which happens
twice in twenty-four hours, is principally occa|&s;ioned
by the action of the moon, and is greater
in the equatorial regions than in other climates.
The earth likewi&s;e performs a rapid motion on
its axis, and, con&s;equently, has a centrifugal
force, which is al&s;o greate&s;t at the equator.
This la&s;t circum&s;tance, independent of actual
ob&s;ervations, proves, that the earth is not a per|fect
&s;phere, but that it mu&s;t be more elevated
under the equator than at the poles. From the&s;e
two combined cau&s;es, the tides, and the motion
<PB N="18" REF="43">
of the earth, it may be fairly concluded, that, al|though
this globe had been originally a perfect
&s;phere, its diurnal motion, and the ebbing and
flowing of the tides, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of time, have elevated the equatorial
parts, by gradually carrying mud, earth, &s;and,
&s;hells, &amp;c. from other climates, and depo&s;iting
them at the equator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XII.</NOTE>. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the
greate&s;t inequalities on the &s;urface of the earth
ought to be found, and, in fact, are found, in
the neighbourhood of the equator. Be&s;ides, as
the alternate motion of the tides has been con|&s;tant
and regular &s;ince the exi&s;tence of the
world, is it not natural to think, that, at each
tide, the water carries from one place to ano|ther
a &s;mall quantity of matter, which falls to
the bottom as a &s;ediment, and forms tho&s;e hori|zontal
and parallel &s;trata that every where ap|pear?
The motion of the waters, in the flux
and reflux, being always horizontal, the matter
tran&s;ported by them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take the
&s;ame parallel direction after it is depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>To this, it may be objected, that, as the flux
is equal to, and regularly &s;ucceeded by the re|flux,
the two motions will blance each other;
or, that the matter brought by the flux will be
carried back by the reflux; and, con&s;equently,
that this cau&s;e of the formation of &s;trata mu&s;t
be chimerical, as the bottom of the ocean can
never be affected by a uniform alternate motion
<PB N="19" REF="44">
of the waters; far le&s;s could this motion change
its original &s;tructure, by creating heights, and
other inequalities.</P>
<P>But, in the fir&s;t place, the alternate motion of
the waters is by no means equal; for the &s;ea
has a continual motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t: Be|&s;ide,
the agitations occa&s;ioned by the winds, pro|duce
great inequalities in the tides. It will like|wi&s;e
be acknowledged, that, by every motion
in the &s;ea, particles of earth, and other mate|rials,
mu&s;t be carried from one place, and de|po&s;ited
in another; and that the&s;e collections
of matter mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the form of parallel and
horizontal &s;trata. Farther, a well known fact
will entirely obviate this objection. On all
coa&s;ts, where the ebbing and flowing are di&s;|cernible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>, numberle&s;s materials are brought in
by the flux, which are not carried back by the
reflux. The &s;ea gradually increa&s;es on &s;ome
places, and recedes from others, narrowing its
limits, by depo&s;iting earth, &s;and, &s;hells, &amp;c.
which naturally take a horizontal po&s;ition.
The&s;e materials, when accumulated and eleva|ted
to a certain degree, gradually &s;hut out the
water, and remain for ever in the form of dry
land.</P>
<P>But, to remove every doubt concerning this
important point, let us examine more clo&s;ely
the practicability of a mountain's being formed
at the bottom of the &s;ea, by the motion and &s;e|diments
<PB N="20" REF="45">
of the water. On a coa&s;t which the
&s;ea wa&s;hes with violence during the flow, &s;ome
part of the earth mu&s;t be carried off by every
&s;troke of the waves. Even where the &s;ea is
bounded by rock, it is a known fact, that the
rock is gradually wa&s;ted by the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>; and,
con&s;equently, that &s;mall particles are carried off
by the retreat of every wave. Tho&s;e particles
of earth or &s;tone are nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;ported to
&s;ome di&s;tance. Whenever the agitation of the
water is abated, the particles are precipitated in
the form of a &s;ediment, and lay the foundation
of a fir&s;t &s;tratum, which is either horizontal, or
inclined, according to the &s;ituation of the &s;ur|face
upon which they fall. This &s;tratum will
&s;oon be &s;ucceeded by a &s;imilar one, produced
by the &s;ame cau&s;e; and thus a con&s;iderable
quantity of matter will be gradually ama&s;&s;ed,
and di&s;po&s;ed in parallel beds. In proce&s;s of
time, this gradually accumulating ma&s;s will be|come
a mountain in the bottom of the &s;ea, ex|actly
re&s;embling, both in external and internal
&s;tructure, the&s;e mountains which we &s;ee on the
dry land. If there happened to be &s;hells in
that part of the bottom of the &s;ea where we
have &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ediments to be depo&s;ited,
they will be covered, filled, and incorporated
with the depo&s;ited matter, and form a part of
the general ma&s;s. The&s;e &s;hells will be lodged
in different parts of the mountains, corre&s;pon|ding
<PB N="21" REF="46">
to the times they were depo&s;ited. Tho&s;e
which lay at the bottom, before the fir&s;t &s;tratum
was formed, will occupy the lowe&s;t &s;tation;
and tho&s;e which were afterwards depo&s;ited, will
be found in the more elevated parts.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, when the bottom of the
&s;ea, at particular places, is troubled by the agi|tation
of the water, earth, clay, &s;hells, and other
matter, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be removed from the&s;e
parts, and depo&s;ited el&s;ewhere. For we are a&s;|&s;ured
by all divers, that the bottom of the &s;ea,
at the greate&s;t depths to which they de&s;cend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boyle's works, vol. 3. p. 232.</NOTE>,
is &s;o &s;trongly affected by the agitation of the
water, that earth, clay, and &s;hells, are removed
to great di&s;tances. Tran&s;portations of this kind
mu&s;t, therefore, be con&s;tantly going on in every
part of the ocean; and the matters tran&s;ported,
after &s;ub&s;iding, mu&s;t uniformly rai&s;e eminences
&s;imilar, in every re&s;pect, to the compo&s;ition and
&s;tructure of our mountains. Thus the motions
produced by the flux and reflux, by winds and
currents, mu&s;t uniformly create inequalities in
the bottom of the ocean.</P>
<P>Further, we mu&s;t not imagine that the&s;e
matters cannot be carried to great di&s;tances,
&s;ince we daily find grain, and other productions
of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, arriving on our
coa&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Particularly on the coa&s;ts of Scotland and of Ireland; See Ray's Di&s;cour&s;es.</NOTE> The&s;e bodies are, indeed, &s;pecifically
lighter than water; but the other &s;ub&s;tances
<PB N="22" REF="47">
are &s;pecifically heavier. Still, however, as they
are reduced to an impalpable powder, they may
be kept long &s;u&s;pended in the water, and, of
cour&s;e, tran&s;ported to any di&s;tance.</P>
<P>It has been conceived, that the agitation pro|duced
by the winds and tides is only &s;uperficial,
and does not affect the bottom, e&s;pecially when
it is very deep. But it ought to be remember|ed,
that, whatever be the depth, the whole ma&s;s
is put in motion by the tides at the &s;ame time;
and that, in a fluid globe, this motion would be
communicated even to the centre. The power
which occa&s;ions the flux and reflux is penetra|ting;
it acts equally upon every particle of the
ma&s;s; &s;o that the quantity of its force, at diffe|rent
depths, may be determined by calculation.
Indeed, this point is &s;o certain, that it admits
not of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>We cannot, therefore, he&s;itate in pronouncing,
that the tides, the winds, and every other cau&s;e
of motion in the &s;ea, mu&s;t produce heights and
inequalities in its bottom; and that the&s;e emi|nences
mu&s;t uniformly be compo&s;ed of regular
&s;trata, either horizontal or inclined. The&s;e
heights will gradually augment; like the waves
which formed them, they will mutually re&s;pect
each other; and, if the extent of the ba&s;e be
great, in a track of years, they will form a va&s;t
chain of mountains. Whenever eminences are
formed, they interrupt the uniform motion of
the waters, and produce new motions, known
<PB N="23" REF="48">
by the name of currents. Between two neigh|bouring
heights in the bottom of the ocean,
there mu&s;t be a current<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIII.</NOTE>, which will follow
their common direction, and, like a river, cut a
channel, the angles of which will be alternately
oppo&s;ite through the whole extent of its cour&s;e.
The&s;e heights mu&s;t continually increa&s;e; for,
during the flow, the water will depo&s;ite its or|dinary
&s;ediment upon their ridges, and the wa|ters
which are impelled by the current will force
along, from great di&s;tances, quantities of matter,
which will &s;ub&s;ide between the hills, and, at the
&s;ame time, &s;coup out a valley with corre&s;ponding
angles at their foundation. Now, by means of
the&s;e different motions and &s;ediments, the bot|tom
of the ocean, though formerly &s;mooth,
mu&s;t &s;oon be furrowed, and inter&s;per&s;ed with
hills and chains of mountains, as we actually
find it at pre&s;ent. The &s;oft materials of which
the eminences were originally compo&s;ed, would
gradually harden by their own gravity. Such
of them as con&s;i&s;ted of &s;andy and cry&s;talline
particles, would produce tho&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es
of rock and flint in which we find cry&s;tals and
other precious &s;tones. Others, compo&s;ed of &s;to|ny
particles mixed with &s;hells, give ri&s;e to tho&s;e
beds of lime-&s;tone and marble, in which va&s;t
quantities of &s;ea-&s;hells are &s;till found incorpora|ted.
La&s;tly, all our beds of marle and chalk have
derived their origin from particles of &s;hells mix|ed
<PB N="24" REF="49">
with a pure earth, collected and depo&s;ited at
particular places in the bottom of the &s;ea. All
the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are di&s;po&s;ed in regular &s;trata;
they all contain heterogenous matter, and va&s;t
quantities of &s;ea-bodies &s;ituated nearly in pro|portion
to their &s;pecific gravities. The lighter
&s;hells are found in chalk; the heavier in clay
and lime-&s;tone. The&s;e &s;hells are uniformly fill|ed
with the matter in which they are found,
whether it be &s;tone or earth; an inconte&s;tible
proof, that they have been tran&s;ported along
with the matter which fills and &s;urrounds them,
and that this matter was then in the form of an
impalpable powder. In a word, all tho&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances,
the horizontal &s;ituation of which has a|ri&s;en
from the waters of the &s;ea, invariably pre|&s;erve
their original po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It may here be objected, that mo&s;t hills who&s;e
&s;ummits con&s;i&s;t rocks of moor-&s;tone, or
of marble, are founded upon &s;mall eminences,
compo&s;ed of le&s;s heavy materials, of clay, for ex|ample,
or of light &s;and, the &s;trata of which com|monly
extend over the neighbouring plains. If
the above theory be ju&s;t, what could bring a|bout
an arrangement &s;o &s;ingular, &s;o contrary to
the laws of gravity? But this phaenomenon ad|mits
of an ea&s;y and natural explication. The
waters would operate fir&s;t upon the upper &s;tra|tum,
either of coa&s;ts, or the bottom of the &s;ea:
This upper &s;tratum con&s;i&s;ts generally of clay or
&s;and; and the&s;e light &s;ub&s;tances, being carried
<PB N="25" REF="50">
off and depo&s;ited previous to the more den&s;e and
&s;olid, they would of cour&s;e from &s;mall eminen|ces,
and become foundations for the more hea|vy
particle to re&s;t upon. After the light &s;uper|ficial
&s;ub&s;tances are removed, the harder and
more ponderous would next be &s;ubjected to the
attrition of the water, reduced to a fine powder,
and carried off and depo&s;ited above the hillocks of
&s;and or clay. The&s;e &s;mall &s;tony particles would,
in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, form tho&s;e &s;olid rocks
which we now find on the tops of hills and
mountains. As particles of &s;tone are heavier
than &s;and or clay, it is probable that they were
originally covered and pre&s;&s;ed by &s;uperior &s;tra|ta
of con&s;iderable depth; but that they now oc|cupy
the highe&s;t &s;tations, becau&s;e they were la&s;t
tran&s;ported by the waves.</P>
<P>To confirm this rea&s;oning, let us inve&s;tigate
more minutely the &s;ituation of tho&s;e materials
which compo&s;e the &s;uperficial part of the globe,
the only part of which we have any adequate
knowledge. The different &s;trata of &s;tones in
quarries are almo&s;t all horizontal or regualrly in|clined.
Tho&s;e founded upon hard clay, or o|ther
&s;olid matter, are evidently horizontal, e|&s;pecially
in plains. The di&s;po&s;ition of quarries,
where flint or browni&s;h free-&s;tone are found in
detached portions, is indeed le&s;s regular. But
even here the uniformity of nature is not inter|rupted;
for the horizontal or regularly inclining
po&s;ition of the &s;trata is apparent in granite and
<PB N="26" REF="51">
brown free-&s;tone, wherever they exi&s;t in large
connected ma&s;&s;es. This po&s;ition is univer&s;al,
excepting in flint and brown free-&s;tone in &s;mall
detached portions, &s;ub&s;tances, the formation of
which we &s;hall demon&s;trate to have been po&s;terior
to tho&s;e ju&s;t now mentioned. The &s;trata of gra|nite,
vitrifiable &s;and, clays, marbles, calcareous
&s;tones, chalk, and marles, are always parallel or
equally inclined. In the&s;e the original forma|tion
is ea&s;ily di&s;coverable; for the &s;trata are ex|actly
horizontal, and very thin, being placed a|bove
each other like the leaves of a book. Beds
of &s;and, of &s;oft and hard clay, of chalk, and of
&s;hells, are likewi&s;e either horizontal or uniform|ly
inclined. Strata of every kind pre&s;erve the
&s;ame thickne&s;s through their whole extent, which
is often many leagues, and might, by proper
ob&s;ervations, be traced &s;till farther. In a word,
the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;trata, as deep as mankind have
hitherto penetrated, is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e beds of &s;and and gravel which are
wa&s;hed down from mountains mu&s;t, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, be excepted from the general rule.
They are &s;ometimes of a con&s;iderable extent in
valleys, and are &s;ituated immediately under the
&s;oil, or fir&s;t &s;tratum. In plains, they are level,
like the more antient and interior &s;trata. But
near the bottom, or upon the ridges of hills,
they have an inclination corre&s;ponding to that
of the ground upon which they have been de|po&s;ited.
As the&s;e beds of &s;and and gravel are
<PB N="27" REF="52">
formed by rivers and brooks, which, e&s;pecially
in the valleys, often change their channels, it is
not &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould be &s;o frequent.
A &s;mall rivulet is &s;ufficient, in a cour&s;e of time,
to &s;pread a bed of &s;and or gravel over a very
large valley. In a champaign country, &s;urround|ed
with hills, who&s;e ba&s;e, as well as the upper
&s;tratum of the plain, con&s;i&s;ted of a hard clay, I
have often ob&s;erved, that, above the origin of
the brooks or rivers, the clay was &s;ituated imme|diately
under the vegetable &s;tratum; but, in the
low grounds, there was a &s;tratum of &s;and, about
a foot thick above the clay, extending to a great
di&s;tance from the banks of the rivers. The &s;trata
formed by rivers are not very antient; they
are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by their frequent inter|ruptions,
and the inequality in thickne&s;s, which
is con&s;tantly varying; but the antient &s;trata
uniformly pre&s;erve the &s;ame dimen&s;ions through
their whole extent. Be&s;ides, the&s;e modern &s;trata
may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, with certainty, by the
form of the &s;tones and gravel they contain,
which bear evident marks of having been roll|ed,
&s;moothed, and rounded by the motion of
water. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made with
regard to tho&s;e beds of turf, and corrupted ve|getables,
which are found in mar&s;hy grounds,
immediately below the &s;oil: They have no claim
to antiquity, but have derived their exi&s;tence
from &s;ucce&s;&s;ive accumulations of decayed trees,
and other plants. The &s;trata of &s;lime, or mud,
<PB N="28" REF="53">
which occur in many places, are al&s;o recent pro|ductions,
having been formed by &s;tagnating wa|ters,
or the inundations of rivers. They are not
&s;o exactly horizontal, or &s;o uniformly inclined,
as the more antient &s;trata, produced by the re|gular
motions of the &s;ea. In &s;trata formed by
rivers, we meet with river, but &s;eldom with &s;ea
&s;hells; and the few that occur are broken, de|tached,
and placed without order. But, in the
antient &s;trata, there are no river-&s;hells; the &s;ea|&s;hells
are numerous, well pre&s;erved, and all pla|ced
in the &s;ame manner, having been tran&s;port|ed
and depo&s;ited at the &s;ame time, and by the
&s;ame cau&s;e. From whence could this beautiful
regularity proceed? In&s;tead of regular &s;trata,
why do we not find the matters compo&s;ing the
earth huddled together without order? Why are
not rocks, marbles, clays, marles, &amp;c. &s;cattered
promi&s;cuou&s;ly, or joined by irregular or vertical
&s;trata? Why are not heavy bodies uniformly
found in a lower &s;ituation than light ones? It is
ea&s;y to perceive, that this uniformity of nature,
this &s;pecies of organization, this union of diffe|rent
materials by parallel &s;trata, without regard
to their weights, could only proceed from a
cau&s;e equally powerful and uniform as the mo|tions
of the &s;ea, produced by regular winds, or
by the flux and reflux, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es act with &s;uperior force under
the equator than in other climates; for there
the tides are higher, and the winds more uni|form.
<PB N="29" REF="54">
The mo&s;t exten&s;ive chains of mountains
are likewi&s;e in the neighbourhood of the equa|tor.
The mountains of Africa and Peru are the
highe&s;t in the world, often extending through
whole continents, and &s;tretching to great di&s;tan|ces
under the waters of the ocean. The moun|tain
of Europe and A&s;ia, which extend from
Spain to China, are not &s;o elevated as tho&s;e of
Africa and South America. According to the
relations of voyagers, the mountains of the north
are but &s;mall hills, when compared to the moun|tains
of the equatorial regions. Be&s;ides, in the
northern &s;eas, there are few i&s;lands; but, in the
Torrid Zone, they are innumerable. Now, as
i&s;lands are only the &s;ummits of mountains, it is
apparent, that there are more inequalities on the
&s;urface of the earth, near the equator, than in
northerly climates.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e prodigious chains of mountains which
run from we&s;t to ea&s;t in the Old Continent, and
from north to &s;outh in the New, mu&s;t have been
formed by the general motion of the tides. But
the origin of the le&s;s con&s;iderable mountains
and hills, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to particular mo|tions,
occa&s;ioned by winds, currents, and other
irregular agitations of the &s;ea: Their formation
may, indeed, be owing to a combination of all
tho&s;e motions, which are capable of infinite va|riations;
for the winds, and the &s;ituation of
different i&s;lands and coa&s;ts, con&s;tantly change
the natural cour&s;e of the tides, making them
<PB N="30" REF="55">
run in every po&s;&s;ible direction. It is, therefore,
by no means &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee con&s;idrable
eminences having no determined direction in
their cour&s;es. But, for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it
is &s;ufficient to have &s;hown, that mountains have
not been produced by earthquakes, or other ac|cidental
cau&s;es, but that they are effects equally
re&s;ulting from the general laws of nature, as
their peculiar &s;tructure, and the &s;ituation of the
materials of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But how has it happened, that this earth,
which we and our ance&s;tors have inhabited for
ages, which, from time immemorial, has been
an immen&s;e continent, dry, compact, and re|moved
from the reach of the water, &s;hould, if
formerly the bottom of an ocean, be now ex|alted
to &s;uch a height above the waters, and &s;o
compleatly &s;eparated from them? Since the wa|ters
remaiend &s;o long upon the earth, why have
they now de&s;erted it? What accident, what
cau&s;e, could introduce a change &s;o great? Is it
even po&s;&s;ible to conceive a cau&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
power &s;ufficient to operate &s;uch an amazing ef|fect?</P>
<P>The&s;e are difficult que&s;tions. But, as the
facts are uncontrovertible, the preci&s;e manner
in which they have happened may remain a &s;e|cret,
without prejudice to the conclu&s;ions which
ought to be drawn from them. A little re|flection,
however, will furni&s;h us at lea&s;t with
<PB N="31" REF="56">
plau&s;ible &s;olutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. We daily ob&s;erve the &s;ea
gaining ground on certain coa&s;ts, and lo&s;ing it
on others. We know, that the ocean has a ge|neral
and uniform motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t;
that it makes violent efforts again&s;t the rocks
and low grounds which encircle it; that there
are whole provinces which human indu&s;try can
hardly defend from the fury of the waves; and
that there are in&s;tances of i&s;lands which have
but lately emerged from the waters, and of re|gular
inundations. Hi&s;tory informs us of in|undations
and deluges of a more exten&s;ive na|ture.
Ought not all this to convince us, that
the &s;urface of the earth has experienced very
great revolutions, and that the &s;ea may have ac|tually
given up po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of
the ground which it formerly occupied? For
example, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the Old and New
worlds were formerly but one continent, and
that, by a violent earthquake, the antient Ata|lantis
of Plato was &s;unk. What would be the
con&s;equence of &s;uch a mighty revolution? The
&s;ea would nece&s;&s;arily ru&s;h in from all quarters,
and form what is now called the Atlantic Ocean;
and va&s;t continents, perhaps tho&s;e which we
now inhabit, would, of cour&s;e, be left dry. This
great revolution might be effected by the &s;udden
failure of &s;ome immen&s;e cavern in the interior
part of the globe, and an univer&s;al deluge would
infallibly &s;ucceed. I would rather incline to
<PB N="32" REF="57">
think, that &s;uch a revolution would not be &s;ud|denly
accompli&s;hed, but that it required a very
long period. However the&s;e conjectures &s;tand,
it is certain, that the revolution has happened,
and I even believe that it happened naturally;
for, if a judgment of the future is to be formed
from the pa&s;t, we have only to attend carefully
to what daily pa&s;&s;es before our eyes. It is a
fact, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the repeated ob&s;ervation of
voyagers, that the ocean has a con&s;tant motion
from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This motion, like the trade|winds,
is not only perceived between the
tropics, but through the whole temperate cli|mates,
and as near the poles as navigators have
approached. As a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of this
motion, the Pacific Ocean mu&s;t make continual
efforts again&s;t the coa&s;ts of Tartary, China, and
India; the Indian Ocean mu&s;t act again&s;t the
ea&s;t coa&s;t of Africa; and the Atlantic mu&s;t act
in a &s;imilar manner again&s;t all the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts
of America. Hence the &s;ea mu&s;t have gained,
and will always continue to gain on the ea&s;t, and
to lo&s;e on the we&s;t. This of it&s;elf would be &s;uf|ficient
to prove the po&s;&s;ibility of the change of
&s;ea into land, and of land into &s;ea. If &s;uch is
the natural effect of the &s;ea's motion from ea&s;t
to we&s;t, may it not rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
A&s;ia, and all the ea&s;tern continent, is the mo&s;t
antient country in the world? and that Europe,
and part of Africa, e&s;pecially the we&s;t parts of
the&s;e continents, as Britain, France, Spain, &amp;c.
<PB N="33" REF="58">
are countries of a more recent date? Both hi&s;to|ry
and phy&s;ics concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing this hypo|the&s;is.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the con&s;tant motion of the &s;ea
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, other cau&s;es concur in produ|cing
the effect ju&s;t mentioned. There are many
lands lower than the level of the &s;ea, and de|fended
only by a narrow i&s;thmus of rock, or by
banks of &s;till weaker materials. The action of
the waters mu&s;t gradually de&s;troy the&s;e barriers,
and, con&s;equently, &s;uch lands mu&s;t then become
part of the ocean. Be&s;ides, the mountains are
daily dimini&s;hing, part of them being con&s;tantly
carried down to the valleys by rains. It is like|wi&s;e
well known, that every little brooke carries
earth, and other matters, from the high grounds
into the rivers, by which they are at la&s;t tran&s;|ported
to the ocean. By the&s;e means, the bot|tom
of the &s;ea is gradually filling up, the &s;ur|face
of the earth is approaching to a level, and
nothing but time is wanting for the &s;ea's &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
changing places with the land.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not here of cau&s;es removed beyond
the &s;phere of our knowledge, of tho&s;e convul|&s;ions
of nature, the &s;lighte&s;t throe of which
would be fatal to the globe. The near approach
of a comet, the ab&s;ence of the moon, or the in|troduction
of a new planet into the &s;y&s;tem, &amp;c.
are &s;uppo&s;itions upon which the imagination
may rove at large. Cau&s;es of this kind will
produce any effect we chu&s;e. From a &s;ingle hy|pothe&s;is
<PB N="34" REF="59">
of this nature, a thou&s;and phy&s;ical ro|mances
might be drawn, and their authors might
dignify them with the title of <HI>Theory of the
Earth.</HI> As an hi&s;torian, I reject the&s;e vain &s;pe|culations:
They depend upon mere po&s;&s;ibilities,
which, if called into action, nece&s;&s;arily imply
&s;uch a deva&s;tation in the univer&s;e, that our
globe, like a fugitive particle of matter, e&s;capes
our ob&s;ervation, and is no longer worthy of our
attention. But, to give con&s;i&s;tency to our ideas,
we mu&s;t take the earth as it is, examine its dif|ferent
parts with minutene&s;s, and, by induction,
judge of the future, from what at pre&s;ent exi&s;ts.
We ought not to be affected by cau&s;es which
&s;eldom act, and who&s;e action is always &s;udden
and violent. The&s;e have no place in the ordi|nary
cour&s;e of nature. But operations uniform|ly
repeated, motions which &s;ucceed one another
without interruption, are the cau&s;es which alone
ought to be the foundation of our rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Some examples &s;hall be given: We &s;hall com|bine
particular effects with general cau&s;es, and
give a detail of facts, which will illu&s;trate and
explain the different alterations that the earth
has undergone, whether by irruptions of the &s;ea
upon the land, or by the &s;ea's retiring from
lands which it formerly covered.</P>
<P>That irruption which gave ri&s;e to the Medi|terranean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs. art. XI. and XIX. p. 209.; Plot. Hi&s;t. Nat. &amp;c.</NOTE>,
is undoubtedly the greate&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ray's Di&s;cour&s;es,</NOTE>. The
<PB N="35" REF="60">
ocean runs with prodigious rapidity through a
narrow pa&s;&s;age between two promontories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. abridged, vol. 2. p. 289. Siculus, Strabo.</NOTE>, and
then forms a va&s;t &s;ea, which, exclu&s;ive of the
Black Sea, is about &s;even times larger than the
kingdom of France. The motion through the
Straits of Gibraltar is contrary to the motion in
every other &s;trait. The general motion of the
&s;ea is from ea&s;t to we&s;t; but, in the Straits of
Gibraltar, it is from we&s;t to ea&s;t: An inconte&s;|tible
proof, that the Mediterranean Sea is not an
antient gulf, but that it has been formed by an
irruption, produced by &s;ome accidental cau&s;e,
&s;uch as an earthquake &s;wallowing up the bar|rier,
or a violent effort of the ocean, occa&s;ioned
by the wind's forcing its way through the bank,
between the two promotories of Gibraltar and
Ceuta. This opinion is &s;upported by the te&s;ti|mony
of the antients<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diodorus</NOTE>, who inform us, that
there was a time when the Mediterranean had
no exi&s;tence. It is likewi&s;e confirmed by na|tural
hi&s;tory, and by ob&s;ervations upon the &s;trata
in the oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts of Africa and Spain,
where, as in neighbouring mountains, the beds
of earth and &s;tone are preci&s;ely the &s;ame at the
&s;ame levels.</P>
<P>When the ocean forced this pa&s;&s;age, it ran
through the Straits with much more rapidity
than at pre&s;ent, and in&s;tantly deluged that large
tract of land which formerly jointed Europe to
<PB N="36" REF="61">
Africa. The waters covered all the grounds
which were lower than the level of the ocean;
and no part of them is now to be &s;een, except
the tops of &s;ome of the mountains, &s;uch as part
of Italy, Sicily, Malta, Cor&s;ica, Sardinia, Cy|prus,
Rhodes, and the i&s;lands of the Archipe|lago.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned the Black Sea as an ef|fect
of this irruption; becau&s;e the quantity of
water it receives from the Danube, the Nieper,
the Don, and other rivers, is more than &s;uffi|cient
both to form and &s;upport it. Be&s;ides, it
runs with great rapidity through the Bo&s;phorus
into the Mediterranean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s; abridged, vol. 2. p. 289.</NOTE>. It may even be &s;up|po&s;ed,
that the Black and Ca&s;pian Seas were on|ly
two large lakes, which were perhaps joined
by a narrow communication, or rather by a mo|ra&s;s,
or &s;mall lake, uniting the Don and the
Wolga about Tria, where the&s;e two rivers run
very near each other. It is likewi&s;e probable,
that the&s;e two &s;eas, or lakes, were formerly of
a much greater extent; for the large rivers
which fall into the Black and Ca&s;pian Seas mu&s;t
have gradually brought down a quantity of earth
and &s;and &s;ufficient to &s;top up the communication,
and to form that neck of land by which the&s;e
two &s;eas are divided. We know, that large ri|vers,
in a cour&s;e of time, block up &s;eas, and form
new lands, as in the province at the mouth of
the Yellow river in China; Loui&s;iana at the
<PB N="37" REF="62">
mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; and the northern part
of Aegypt, which derived its exi&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels.</NOTE> from the
inundations of the Nile<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. Such quantities of
earth are brought down, by the rapidity of the
Nile, from the interior parts of Africa, and de|po&s;ited
during the inundations, that you may
dig fifty feet deep before you can reach the bot|tom
of the &s;lime and mud. Loui&s;iana, and the
province of the Yellow river have, in the &s;ame
manner, been original formed by the &s;lime
of rivers.</P>
<P>Farther, the Ca&s;pian Sea is a real lake. It has
no communication with any other &s;ea, not even
with the Lake Aral, which appears to have
been a part of it, being only &s;eparated by a large
tract of &s;and, in which neither river nor canal
for carrying off the waters have been di&s;covered.
This &s;ea, therefore, has no external communica|tion
with any other; and I doubt much if there
is any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a &s;ubterraneous commu|nication
with the Black Sea, or with the Gulf
of Per&s;ia. The Ca&s;pian, it is true, receives the
Wolga, and &s;everal other rivers, which appear
to furni&s;h as much water as is lo&s;t by evapora|tion.
But, independent of the difficulties attend|ing
&s;uch calculations, if it communicates with any
other &s;ea, a uniform and rapid current towards
the place of communication would be an infal|lible
con&s;equence; but no &s;uch thing has yet
been di&s;covered. Travellers of the be&s;t credit
<PB N="38" REF="63">
a&s;&s;ure us of the contrary; we, therefore, con|clude,
that the Ca&s;pian Sea receives ju&s;t as much
water from the rivers and clouds as it lo&s;es by
evaporation.</P>
<P>It is not improbable, that the Black Sea will,
&s;ome time or other, be entirely divided from the
Mediterranean; and that the Bo&s;phorus will be
chocked up, whenever the rivers &s;hall have ac|cumulated
a &s;ufficient quantity of materials to
bring about that effect. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ix
the aera of this event; but time, and the dimi|nution
of waters in rivers, in proportion as the
mountains are lowered by the cau&s;es mentioned
above, will one day exhibit this phaenomenon to
the world.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;pian and Black Seas &s;hould, there|fore,
be con&s;idered rather as lakes than as gulfs
of the ocean; becau&s;e they exactly re&s;emble o|ther
lakes that receive a number of rivers with|out
any vi&s;ible outlet, as the Dead Sea, &s;everal
lakes in Africa, and el&s;ewhere. Be&s;ides, the &s;alt|ne&s;s
of the&s;e two &s;eas is not nearly equal to that
of the Mediterranean or the ocean; and it is an
agreed point, that the navigation in the Ca&s;pian
and Black &s;eas, on account of their numberle&s;s
&s;hoals, rocks, and banks, is &s;o extremely hazard|ous,
that only &s;mall ve&s;&s;els can be u&s;ed in them
with &s;afety. This circum&s;tance proves farther,
that the&s;e &s;eas ought not to be con&s;idered as gulfs
of the ocean, but as va&s;t collections of water a|ma&s;&s;ed
by large rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="64">
If the i&s;thmus which &s;eparates Africa from
A&s;ia were cut, it would nece&s;&s;arily create a great
irruption of the &s;ea upon the land. This was
formerly projected by the Kings of Aegypt, and
adopted &s;ince by the Califs. I doubt whether
the pretended communication between the Red
Sea and Mediterranean be &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed.
The Red Sea is a narrow branch of the ocean:
Through its whole extent, not a &s;ingle river runs
into it from the Aegyptian &s;ide, and very few
from the oppo&s;ite. This &s;ea will not, therefore,
be &s;ubject to diminution, like tho&s;e &s;eas or lakes
which are actually impaired by the &s;lime and
&s;and brought down by large rivers. The Red
Sea receives all its waters directly from the o|cean,
and the motion of the tides in it are very
di&s;cernible; of cour&s;e, it mu&s;t be affected by the
general motions of the ocean. The Mediterra|nean,
on the other hand, mu&s;t be lower than the
ocean; becau&s;e the current through the Straits is
exceedingly rapid. Be&s;ides, it receives the Nile,
which runs parallel to the we&s;t coa&s;t of the Red
Sea, and pa&s;&s;es through the longe&s;t extent of
Aegypt, which is a very low country. From
the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is at lea&s;t probable, that
the Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean,
and, con&s;equently, that, if the i&s;thmus of Suez
were cut, a great inundation, and a con&s;iderable
augmentation of the Mediterranean, would en|&s;ue;
e&s;pecially if the waters were not re&s;trained
by dikes and &s;luices placed at proper di&s;tances.
<PB N="40" REF="65">
This precaution was probably u&s;ed, if ever the
antient canal exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>But, not to &s;pend too much time on conjec|tures,
which, however well founded, may per|haps
appear ra&s;h, we &s;hall give &s;ome certain and
recent examples of the changes of &s;ea into land,
and of land into &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XIX.</NOTE>. At Venice, the bottom of
the &s;ea is con&s;tantly ri&s;ing: If the canals had
not been carefully kept clean, the moats and ci|ty
would, long ere now, have formed a part of
the continent. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of
mo&s;t harbours, bays, and mouths of rivers. In
Holland, the bottom of the &s;ea is elevated in ma|ny
places; the gulf of Zuderzee and the &s;traits
of the Texel, cannot receive &s;uch large ve&s;&s;els
as formerly. At the mouth of almo&s;t every ri|ver,
we find &s;mall i&s;lands, and banks of earth
and &s;and brought down from the higher grounds;
and it is uncontravertible, that the &s;ea is con|&s;tantly
dammed up, wherever great rivers empty
them&s;elves. The Rhine is lo&s;t in the &s;ands
which it&s;elf has accumulated. The Danube, the
Nile, and all large rivers, after having tran&s;port|ed
great quantities of &s;lime, &s;and, &amp;c. never more
arrive at the &s;ea by a &s;ingle channel; they &s;plit
into branches, the intervals of which con&s;i&s;t of
the materials which they them&s;elves have tran&s;|ported.
Mar&s;hes are daily drained; lands, a|bandoned
by the &s;ea, are now plowed and &s;own;
we navigate whole countries now covered by the
<PB N="41" REF="66">
waters; in a word, we &s;ee &s;o many in&s;tances of
land changed into water, and water into land,
that we mu&s;t be convinced of the continual,
though &s;low progre&s;s of &s;uch changes in all pla|ces.
So that, in time, the gulfs of the ocean will
become continents; the i&s;thmu&s;es will be chan|ged
into &s;traits; and the tops of the mountains
will be metamorpho&s;ed into &s;hoaly rocks in the
&s;ea.</P>
<P>The waters, then, have covered, and may &s;till
cover, every part of the earth which is now dry.
Our a&s;toni&s;hment at finding the productions of
the &s;ea di&s;per&s;ed every where, and a compo&s;ition
of bodies which could not be effected by any o|ther
means than the operation of the waters,
ought forever to cea&s;e. We have already ex|plained
how the horizontal &s;trata of the earth
were formed. But tho&s;e perpendicular &s;i&s;&s;ures,
which are equally diffu&s;ed through rocks, clays,
and every con&s;tituent material of the globe, re|main
to be con&s;idered. The perpendicular fi&s;|&s;ures
are indeed placed at greater di&s;tances from
each other than the horizontal; and the &s;ofter
the matter, the more di&s;tant are the fi&s;&s;ures. In
marble and hard &s;tone, the fi&s;&s;ures are only a
few feet a&s;under. If the ma&s;s of rock be ex|ten&s;ive,
the di&s;tance betwixt the fi&s;&s;ures is &s;ome
fathoms: Sometimes they extend from the &s;um|mit
to the ba&s;e of the rock, and &s;ometimes they
terminate after arriving at a horizontal fi&s;&s;ure.
They are uniformly perpendicular in the &s;trata
<PB N="42" REF="67">
of all calcareous &s;ub&s;tances, as chalk, marles,
marble, &amp;c. But they are more oblique and
le&s;s regularly &s;ituated, in vitre&s;cent bodies, brown
free-&s;tone, and rocks of flint, where they are
often adorned with cry&s;tals and other minerals.
In quarries of marble, or of calcareous &s;tone, the
fi&s;&s;ures at filled with &s;par, gyp&s;um, gravel, and
an earthy &s;and, which contains a con&s;iderable
portion of chalk. In marles, and every other
&s;pecies of earth, except &s;and-&s;tone, the perpen|dicular
fi&s;&s;ures are either empty or filled with
&s;uch matters as have been tran&s;ported thither by
water.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures is ea&s;ily
inve&s;tigated. As various materials con&s;tituting
the different &s;trata were tran&s;ported by the wa|ters,
and depo&s;ited in the form of &s;ediments,
they would at fir&s;t be in a very diluted &s;tate, and
would gradually harden and part with the &s;u|perfluous
quantity of water they contained. In
the proce&s;s of drying, they would naturally con|tract,
and of cour&s;e &s;plit at irregular di&s;tances.
The&s;e fi&s;&s;ures nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;umed a perpendicu|lar
direction; becau&s;e, in this direction, the ac|tion
of gravity of one particle upon another is
equal to nothing; but it acts directly oppo&s;ite
to this de&s;cription in a horizontal &s;ituation: The
diminution in bulk could have no &s;en&s;ible effect
but in a vertical line. I &s;ay, the contraction of
the parts in drying, not the contained water
forcing an i&s;&s;ue, as has been alledged, is the cau&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="68">
of perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures; for I have often re|marked,
that the &s;ides of tho&s;e fi&s;&s;ures, through
their whole extent, corre&s;pond as exactly as the
two &s;ides of a &s;plit piece of wood. Their &s;ur|faces
are rude and irregular; whereas, if they
had taken their ri&s;e from the motion of wa|ter,
they would have been &s;mooth and poli&s;hed.
Hence the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures mu&s;t have been produced,
either &s;uddenly or gradually, by drying and con|tracting,
like the cracks and fi&s;&s;ures in green
wood; and the greate&s;t part of the water the
bodies contained, mu&s;t have evaporated by the
pores. In the chapter upon minerals, we &s;hall
demon&s;trate, that &s;ome part of the original wa|ter
&s;till remains in &s;tones and &s;everal other &s;ub|&s;tances;
and that cry&s;tals, minerals, and &s;ome o|ther
bodies, owe their exi&s;tence to this water.</P>
<P>Perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures vary greatly as to the
extent of their openings. Some are about half
an inch, or an inch, others a foot, or two feet;
&s;ome extend &s;everal fathoms, and give ri&s;e to
tho&s;e va&s;t precipices which &s;o frequently occur
between oppo&s;ite parts of the &s;ame rocks in the
Alps and other high mountains. It is plain,
that the fi&s;&s;ures, the openings of which are &s;mall,
have been occa&s;ioned &s;olely by drying. But
tho&s;e which extend &s;everal feet, are partly ow|ing
to another cau&s;e; namely, the &s;inking of
the foundation upon one &s;ide, while that of the
other remains firm. If the ba&s;e &s;inks but a line
or two, when the height of the rock is con&s;ide|rable,
<PB N="44" REF="69">
an opening of &s;everal feet, or even fa|thoms,
will be the con&s;equence. When rocks
are founded on clay or &s;and, they &s;ometimes
&s;lip a little to a &s;ide; and the fi&s;&s;ures are of cour&s;e
augmented by this motion. I have not hither|to
mentioned tho&s;e large openings, tho&s;e prodi|gious
cuts which are to be met with in rocks and
mountains: The&s;e could not be produced by a|ny
other means than the &s;inking of immen&s;e
&s;ubterraneous caverns that were unable longer
to &s;u&s;tain their incumbent load. But the&s;e cuts
or intervals in mountains are not of the &s;ame
nature with perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures: They ap|pear
to have been ports opened by the hand of
nature for the communication of nations. This
&s;eems to be the intention of all large openings
in chains of mountains, and of tho&s;e &s;traits by
which different parts of the ocean are connec|ted;
as the Straits of Thermopyle, of Gibral|tar,
&amp;c.; the gaps or ports in Mount Cauca|&s;us,
the Cordeliers, &amp;c. A &s;imple &s;eparation,
by the drying of the matter, could not produce
this effect: Large portions of earth mu&s;t have
been &s;unk, &s;wallowed up, or thrown down<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs. art. XVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e great &s;inkings, though occa&s;ioned by
accidental and &s;econdary cau&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, are leading
facts in the hi&s;tory of the earth, and have con|tributed
greatly in changing the appearance of
its &s;urface. Mo&s;t of them have been produced
by &s;ubterraneous fires, the explo&s;ions of which
<PB N="45" REF="70">
give ri&s;e to earthquakes and volcano's. The
force of inflamed matter &s;hut up in the bowels
of the earth is irre&s;i&s;tible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agricola de rebus quae effluunt e terra. Phil. tran&s;. a|brid. vol. ii. p. 391. Ray's di&s;cour&s;es. p. 272.</NOTE>. By the action of
&s;ubterraneous fires, whole cities have been &s;wal|lowed
up, mountains, and large tracts of coun|try
have been overturned and rendered unfit for
the habitation of men. But, though this force
be great, though its effects appear to be prodi|gious,
we cannot a&s;&s;ent to the opinions of &s;ome
authors, who &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e &s;ubterraneous
fires are only branches of an immen&s;e aby&s;s of
flame in the centre of the earth. Neither do we
credit the common notion, that the&s;e fires have
their &s;eat at a great depth below the &s;urface; for
matter cannot begin to burn, or at lea&s;t the in|flammation
cannot be &s;upported, without air.
In examining the materials that i&s;&s;ue from vol|cano's,
even in their mo&s;t violent eruptions, it
is ea&s;y to perceive that the furnace is not very
deep, and that the inflamed &s;ub&s;tances are the
&s;ame with tho&s;e on the top of the mountain,
only disfigured by calcination and the melting
of the metallic particles they contain. To be
convinced that the matter thrown out by vol|cano's
do not come from any con&s;iderable depth,
we need only attend to the height of the moun|tain,
and con&s;ider the immen&s;e force which
would be nece&s;&s;ary to project &s;tones and mine|rals
to the height of half a league; for Aetna,
<PB N="46" REF="71">
Hecla, and other volcano's, have at lea&s;t that
elevation.</P>
<P>Now, it is well known, that fire acts equally
on all &s;ides; it cannot, therefore, act upwards
with a force &s;ufficient to throw large &s;tones half
a league high, without an equal re-action on
the ba&s;e and &s;ides. But the &s;ides of the moun|tain
would very &s;oon be pierced and blown to
pieces by this re-action; becau&s;e the materials
of which it con&s;i&s;ts are not more den&s;e or firm
than tho&s;e which are projected. How, then, can
it be imagined, that the cavity, which mu&s;t be
con&s;idered as the tube or cannon, could po&s;&s;ibly
re&s;i&s;t a force nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e &s;uch heavy bodies
to the mouth of the volcano? Be&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;e
the cavity deeper, as the external orifice is not
great, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o large a
quantity of liquid and burning matters to i&s;&s;ue
forth at a time, without cla&s;hing again&s;t each
other, and again&s;t the irregular &s;ides of the ca|vity;
and, in pa&s;&s;ing through &s;o long a &s;pace,
they would be in danger of cooling and con|gealing.
Rivers of melted &s;ulphur and bitumen,
projected from volcano's along with &s;tones and
minerals, run from the tops of the mountains
into the plains. Is it natural to think, that mat|ter
&s;o fluid, &s;o little able to re&s;i&s;t violent action,
could be projected from a very great depth?
Every ob&s;ervation which can be made on this
&s;ubject will tend to prove, that the fire in vol|cano's
is not very di&s;tant from the tops of the
<PB N="47" REF="72">
mountains, and never de&s;cends &s;o low as the
level of the plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borelli de incendiis Aetnae.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This account of volcano's, however, is not
incon&s;i&s;tent with their being the cau&s;e of con&s;i|derable
earthquakes; neither does it contradict
the communication of one volcano with ano|ther,
by means of &s;ubtertaneous pa&s;&s;ages<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. abridged, vol. 2. p. 392.</NOTE>. But
the depth of the furnace is the object of our
pre&s;ent inve&s;tigation; and it cannot be very di&s;|tant
from the mouth of the volcano. To pro|duce
an earthquake in a plain, it is not nece&s;&s;ary
that the bottom of the volcano &s;hould be below
the level of that plain, nor that there &s;hould be
&s;ubterraneous cavities filled with the &s;ame burn|ing
matter under it. A violent explo&s;ion,
with which eruptions are uniformly accompa|nied,
may, like that of a powder-magazine,
give &s;uch a concu&s;&s;ion as to produce, by its re|action,
an earthquake of con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>I mean not to &s;ay that there are no earth|quakes
which derive their exi&s;tence from &s;ub|terranean
fires<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVI.</NOTE>; but that there are earthquakes
produced &s;olely by the explo&s;ion of volcano's.
In confirmation of what has been &s;aid upon this
&s;ubject, volcano's &s;eldom or never appear in
plains; on the contrary, their mouths, or cra|ters,
are always found on the tops of the high|e&s;t
mountains. If the &s;ubterraneous fire of vol|cano's
&s;tretched below the plains, would not
<PB N="48" REF="73">
new pa&s;&s;ages be opened there during violent
eruptions, rather than in the tops of the moun|tains,
where the re&s;i&s;tance is greater? In the
fir&s;t eruption, would it not have been ea&s;ier to
pierce a plain, than a mountain of half a league
in height?</P>
<P>It is not difficult to di&s;cover the rea&s;on why
volcano's appear only in mountains. Greater
quantities of minerals, &s;ulphur, and pyrites, exi&s;t
in mountains, and nearer the &s;urface than in
plains. The mountains have likewi&s;e this far|ther
advantage; they are more &s;ubject to the
impre&s;&s;ions of the air, and receive more rain and
moi&s;ture, by which mineral &s;ub&s;tances are ca|pable
of being fermented to &s;uch a degree as to
produce actual inflammation.</P>
<P>To conclude, it has often been ob&s;erved, that,
after violent eruptions, the mountains have &s;unk
and dimini&s;hed, nearly in proportion to the
quantity of matter thrown out, which is another
proof that volcano's are not &s;o deep as the ba&s;e
of the mountains, and even that they are not
much below the &s;ummit.</P>
<P>In many places, earthquakes have formed
con&s;iderable hollows, and even &s;ome large gaps
in mountains. All other inequalities are coeval
with the mountains them&s;elves, and owe their
exi&s;tence to currents in the ocean; for, in every
place which has not been di&s;turbed by acciden|tal
convul&s;ions, the &s;trata of mountains are pa|rallel,
<PB N="49" REF="74">
and their angles corre&s;pond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVII.</NOTE>. It is not
difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ubterraneous caverns and
excavations formed by volcano's, from tho&s;e
produced by water. The latter con&s;i&s;t only of
&s;olid rocks, the &s;and and clay with which they
were formerly filled being carried off by water,
which is the origin of caverns in hills; for tho&s;e
found in plains are commonly nothing but old
pits and quarries, like the &s;alt-quarries of Mae|&s;tricht,
the mines of Poland, &amp;c. But natural
caverns are proper to the mountains; the &s;um|mit,
or higher parts, furni&s;h them with water,
which afterwards i&s;&s;ues out to the &s;urface where|ever
it can find a pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e are the &s;ources
of &s;prings and rivers. When a large cavern of
this kind is &s;uddenly filled up by the falling of
its roof, an inundation is generally the con&s;e|quence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. abridged, vol. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, it is ea&s;y to perceive how
much &s;ubterraneous fires have contributed to
change both the &s;urface and internal part of the
globe. This cau&s;e has power enough to pro|duce
very great effects. But it is difficult to
conceive how any &s;en&s;ible alterations upon the
land can be introduced by the winds<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XV.</NOTE>. Their
dominion would appear to be confined to the
&s;ea. Indeed, next to the tides, nothing has &s;uch
a powerful influence upon the waters; the flux
and reflux proceed with an uniform pace; their
<PB N="50" REF="75">
operations are always the &s;ame; but the action
of the winds is capricious and violent. They
ru&s;h on with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, and excite &s;uch
impetuous commotions, that the ocean, from a
&s;mooth and tranquil plain, in an in&s;tant is fur|rowed
with waves that emulate the height of
mountains, and da&s;h them&s;elves in pieces again&s;t
the &s;hores. The &s;urface of the ocean is &s;ubject
to con&s;tant alterations from the winds. But
ought not the &s;urface of the land, which has &s;o
&s;olid an appearance, ever to remain uninfluenced
by a cau&s;e of this kind? It is con&s;onant to experi|ence,
however, that the winds rai&s;e mountains of
&s;and in Arabia and Africa; that they overwhelm
large plains with it; and that they frequently
carry the&s;e &s;ands many leagues into the &s;ea, where
they accumulate in &s;uch quantities as to form
banks, downs, and even i&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bellarmin. de a&s;cen. mentis in Deum. Varen. Geog. p. 282. Voyag. de Pyrand, tom. 1. p. 470.</NOTE>. It is al&s;o
well known, that hurricanes are the &s;courge of
the Antilles, of Madaga&s;car, and of other coun|tries,
where their impetuo&s;ity is &s;o great, that
they &s;weep away trees, plants, and animals, to|gether
with the &s;oil which nouri&s;hed them.
They drive back, they annihilate rivers, and
produce new ones; they overthrow rocks and
mountains; they &s;coup out holes and gulphs in
the earth, and totally change the face of tho&s;e
unhappy countries that give birth to them. Hap|pily,
<PB N="51" REF="76">
few climates are expo&s;ed to the violence of
tho&s;e dreadful agitations of the air.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t changes upon the &s;urface of
the earth are occa&s;ioned by rains, rivers, and tor|rents
from the mountains. The&s;e derive their
origin from vapours rai&s;ed by the &s;un from the
&s;urface of the ocean, and which are tran&s;ported
by the winds through every climate. The pro|gre&s;s
of the&s;e vapours, which are &s;upported by
the air, and tran&s;ported at the plea&s;ure of the
winds, is interrupted by the tops of the moun|tains,
where they accumulate into clouds, and
fall down in the form of rain, dew, or &s;now.
At fir&s;t, the&s;e waters de&s;cended into the plains
without any fixed cour&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See proofs, art. X. and XVIII.</NOTE>; but they gradually
hollowed out proper channels for them&s;elves.
By the power of gravity, they ran to the bottom
of the mountains, and, penetrating or di&s;&s;olving
the lower grounds, they carried along with them
&s;and and gravel, cut deep furrows in the plains,
and thus opened pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ea, which al|ways
receives as much water by rivers, as it
lo&s;es by evaporation. The windings in the
channels of rivers have uniformly corre&s;ponding
angles on their oppo&s;ite banks; and, as moun|tains
and hills, which may be regarded as the
banks of the valleys by which they are &s;epara|ted,
have likewi&s;e &s;inuo&s;ities with corre&s;ponding
angles, this circum&s;tance &s;eems to demon&s;trate,
that the valleys have been gradually formed by

the channels of rivers have been produced.</P>
<P>The waters which run upon the &s;urface, and
&s;upport the verdure and fertility of the &s;oil,
compo&s;e not perhaps one half of the quantity
that is produced by vapour. Numberle&s;s veins
of water &s;ink deep into the bowels of the earth.
In &s;ome places, you are certain of obtaining
water by digging; in others, none can be found.
In almo&s;t all the valleys and low grounds, at a
certain depth, water is uniformly to be met
with. But, in all high grounds, it is impo&s;&s;ible
to extract water from the bowels of the earth.
It mu&s;t be collected from the heavens. There
are exten&s;ive countries where no wells can be
obtained; there men, and other animals, are
&s;upplied with drink from ci&s;terns and pools. In
the ca&s;t, and e&s;pecially in Arabia, Aegypt, and
Per&s;ia, wells and &s;prings are great and valuable
rarities. To &s;upply their place, the inhabitants
have been obliged to make large re&s;ervoirs to
collect the water that falls from the heavens.
The&s;e works, projected and executed from public
nece&s;&s;ity, con&s;titute the mo&s;t beautiful and mag|nificent
monuments of the ea&s;t. Some ea&s;tern
re&s;ervoirs have more than two &s;quare leagues of
&s;uperficies, and fertilize whole provinces by
numberle&s;s ducts and canals let out from all &s;ides.
But, in plain countries, furni&s;hed with large ri|vers,
it is impo&s;&s;ible to break the &s;urface of the
earth without finding water. In camps &s;ituated in
<PB N="53" REF="78">
the neighbourhood of rivers, it often happens,
that every tent may have its own well, by giving
a few &s;trokes with a pick-ax.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the water, &s;o liberally diffu&s;ed through
low grounds, comes from the neighbouring hills
and eminences. During great rains, or the &s;ud|den
melting of &s;now, part of the water runs up|on
the &s;urface; but mo&s;t of it penetrates the
earth and rocks, by means of &s;mall chinks and
fi&s;&s;ures. This water ri&s;es again to the &s;urface,
whenever it can find an i&s;&s;ue; but it often drills
through &s;ands, and creeps along till it finds a
bottom of clay, or hard earth, and there forms
&s;ubterraneous lakes, brooks, and perhaps rivers,
of which the channels are for ever buried in o|blivion.
Subterraneous rivers, however, mu&s;t
follow the general law of nature, and uniformly
run from the higher to the lower ground; their
waters mu&s;t of cour&s;e either fall at la&s;t into the
&s;ea, or be collected in &s;ome low place, whether
at the &s;urface, or in the bowels of the earth:
For there are &s;everal lakes which neither receive
nor give ri&s;e to any river. A &s;till greater num|ber
receive no con&s;iderable river, but are the
&s;ources of the large&s;t rivers on earth; as the
lakes from which the river St Laurence i&s;&s;ues;
the lake Chiam&egrave;, from which two large rivers
ari&s;e, that water the kingdoms of A&s;em and
Pegu; the lakes of A&s;&s;iniboil in America; tho&s;e
of Ozera in Mu&s;covy; tho&s;e that give ri&s;e to
<PB N="54" REF="79">
the Bog and the Irtis, and many others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XI.</NOTE>. It
is plain, that the&s;e lakes mu&s;t derive their exi&s;t|ence
from the waters of &s;uperior grounds, run|ning
through &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages. Some,
indeed, have affirmed, that lakes are to be met
with on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains. But
this is incredible; for the lakes found on the
Alps, and other elevated &s;ituations, are all over|topped
by higher mountains, and derive their
origin from the waters which run down the
&s;ides, or are filtered through the bowels of the&s;e
&s;uperior eminences, in the &s;ame manner as the
lakes in valleys are &s;upplied.</P>
<P>From this rea&s;oning, the exi&s;tence of &s;ubter|raneous
collections of water, e&s;pecially under
large plains, is apparent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. XVIII.</NOTE>: For mountains, hills,
and heights of every kind, are expo&s;ed on all
&s;ides to the weather. The waters that fall up|on
their &s;ummits, and upon elevated plains, after
penetrating the earth, mu&s;t, from the declivity of
the ground, break out at many places in the form
of &s;prings and fountains: Of cour&s;e, little water
will be found in the bowels of mountains. But,
in plains, as the water filtrated through the
earth can find no i&s;&s;ue, it mu&s;t be collected in &s;ub|terraneous
caverns, or di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall veins,
among &s;and and gravel. This is the origin of
the water &s;o univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed through low
grounds. The bottom of a pit or well, is only
a &s;mall artificial ba&s;on, into which the water in|&s;inuates
<PB N="55" REF="80">
it&s;elf from the higher grounds. At fir&s;t
it generally falls in by drops; but afterwards,
when the pa&s;&s;ages become more open, it receives
fre&s;h &s;upplies from greater di&s;tances, and runs
in &s;mall continued veins or rills. To this cir|cum&s;tance
it is owing, that, although water may
be found in any part of a plain, only a certain
number of wells can be &s;upplied. This number
is in proportion to the quantity of water diffu&s;ed,
or rather to the extent of the higher grounds
from which it comes.</P>
<P>To find water, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to dig below
the level of the river. It is commonly found at
&s;maller depths. The water of rivers &s;eldom
&s;preads far in the earth by filtration. Even
what is found in the earth below the level of
rivers, is not derived from them; for, in rivers
which have been dried up, or who&s;e cour&s;es have
been changed, no greater quantity of water is
obtained by digging, than in the neighbouring
ground at an equal depth. Five or &s;ix feet of
earth is &s;ufficient to contain water, and to pre|vent
its e&s;cape: I have often remarked, that the
banks of rivulets or pools have no &s;en&s;ible
moi&s;ture at the di&s;tance of &s;ix inches from the
water. It is true, the filtration is always in
proportion to the penetrability of the ground.
But, upon examining the &s;tagnating pools with
a &s;andy bottom, it is remarkable that the moi|&s;ture
&s;preads but a few inches. Neither is the
extent of it great in a vegetable &s;oil, which is
<PB N="56" REF="81">
much more loo&s;e and porous than &s;and or hard
earth. A garden-bed, though plentifully wa|tered,
communicates little or no moi&s;ture to tho&s;e
adjoining. I have examined level heaps of gar|den-earth,
of &s;ix or eight feet thick, which had
remained undi&s;turbed for &s;ome years, and found
that the rain-water had never reached above
three or four feet deep. I have made the &s;ame
ob&s;ervation upon earth which had lain 200 years
in ridges: Below the depth of three or four feet,
it was as dry as du&s;t. Hence the &s;preading of
water by filtration alone, is not &s;o exten&s;ive as
has generally been imagined. Very little can
de&s;cend in this way to the bowels of the earth.
But water, by its own gravity, de&s;cends from the
&s;urface to the greate&s;t depths. It &s;inks through
natural conduits, or forces pa&s;&s;ages for it&s;elf: It
follows the roots of trees, the &s;i&s;&s;ures of rocks,
or their inter&s;tices. It divides and expands on
all hands into an infinite number of &s;mall branches
or rills; and uniformly de&s;cends till its progre&s;s
is &s;topped by clay or a &s;olid earth, where it ac|cumulates
and breaks out to the &s;urface in form
of a &s;pring or fountain.</P>
<P>It would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k to make an exact
calculation of the quantity of &s;ubterraneous wa|ters
which have no apparent i&s;&s;ue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proofs, art. X. XI. and XVIII.</NOTE>. Many
pretend that it greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the waters
on the &s;urface: Not to mention tho&s;e who think
that the interior part of the globe is entirely fill|ed
<PB N="57" REF="82">
with water, it is imagined by &s;ome, that
there is an infinite number of rivers, rills, and
lakes, in the bowels of the earth. But this opi|nion
&s;eems to have no proper foundation; and
it is probable, that the quantity of &s;ubterrane|ous
waters which never appear at the &s;urface, is
very incon&s;iderable; for, if the number of &s;ub|terraneous
rivers were &s;o great, Why do we
never &s;ee any of their mouths break out, like
&s;prings, on the &s;urface? Be&s;ides, rivers produce
con&s;iderable changes on the &s;urface of the earth;
they carry off the &s;oil; they wear away the mo&s;t
&s;olid rocks, and remove every thing that oppo&s;es
their pa&s;&s;age. The &s;ame effects would re&s;ult from
&s;ubterraneous rivers. But no &s;uch changes have
ever been di&s;covered; nothing below the &s;urface
is di&s;placed; the different &s;trata every where
pre&s;erve their parallel and primitive po&s;ition;
and it is only in very few places that &s;ubter|raneous
veins of water, of any con&s;ideration,
have been di&s;covered. Thus, the internal ope|ration
of water, though great, is not affected by
the motion of it in large bodies: As it is divi|ded
into an infinity of &s;mall veins, which are
often &s;hut up by numberle&s;s ob&s;tacles, it gives
ri&s;e to many &s;ub&s;tances, which are totally differ|ent,
both in form and &s;tructure, from tho&s;e of
the primitive matter.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, we may con|clude,
that the flux and reflux of the ocean have
produced all the mountains, valleys, and other
<PB N="58" REF="83">
inequalities on the &s;urface of the earth; that cur|rents
of the &s;ea have &s;couped out the valleys,
elevated the hills, and be&s;towed on them their
corre&s;ponding directions; that the &s;ame waters
of the ocean, by tran&s;porting and depo&s;iting
earth, &amp;c. have given ri&s;e to the parallel &s;trata;
that the waters from the heavens gradually de|&s;troy
the effects of the &s;ea, by continually di|mini&s;hing
the height of the mountains, filling
up the valleys, and choaking the mouths of ri|vers;
and, by reducing every thing to its for|mer
level, they will, in time, re&s;tore the earth to
the &s;ea, which, by its natural operations, will a|gain
create new continents, inter&s;per&s;ed with
mountains and valleys, and every way &s;imilar to
tho&s;e which we now inhabit.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Formation of Planets.</HEAD>
<P>NATURAL hi&s;tory being our &s;ubject, we
would willingly di&s;pen&s;e with a&s;trono|mical
ob&s;ervations. But, as the Earth is &s;o near|ly
related to the heavenly bodies, and as ob&s;er|vations
of this kind illu&s;trate more fully tho&s;e doc|trines
we have already advanced, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
give &s;ome general ideas of the formation, mo|tion,
and figure of the earth, and other planets.</P>
<P>The earth is a globe of about 3000 leagues in
diameter; it is &s;ituated 30 million of leagues from
the &s;un, round which it revolves in 365 days.
This annual revolution is the effect of two
forces; the one may be con&s;idered as an impul&s;e
from right to left, or from left to right; the
<PB N="60" REF="85">
other as an attraction from above downwards, or
from below upwards, to a common centre. The
direction and quantity of the&s;e forces are com|bined,
and &s;o nicely adju&s;ted, that they produce
a uniform motion in an ellip&s;e approaching to
a circle. Like the other planets, the earth is
opaque, throws out a &s;hadow, and reflects the
rays of the &s;un, about which it revolves in a
time proportioned to its relative di&s;tance and
den&s;ity. It likewi&s;e revolves about its own axis
in 24 hours; and its axis is inclined to the plane
of its orbit 66&frac12; degrees. Its figure is that of a
&s;pheroid, the two axes of which differ from each
other about 165th part; and it revolves round
the &s;horte&s;t axis.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal phaenomena of the
earth, the re&s;ults of di&s;coveries made by means
of geometry, a&s;tronomy, and navigation. It is
unnece&s;&s;ary here to enumerate the proofs and
ob&s;ervations by which the&s;e facts have been e|&s;tabli&s;hed.
We &s;hall confine our remarks to
&s;uch objects as are &s;till doubtful; and &s;hall there|fore
proceed to give our ideas concerning the
formation of planets, and the changes they have
undergone, previous to their arriving at the &s;tate
in which we now perceive them. To the many
&s;y&s;tems and hypothe&s;es that have been framed
concerning the formation of the earth, and the
different &s;tates it has pa&s;&s;ed through, we may be
allowed to add our own conjectures, e&s;pecially
as we are determined to &s;upport them with a &s;u|perior
<PB N="61" REF="86">
degree of probability; and we are the
more encouraged to deliver our notions on this
&s;ubject, becau&s;e we hope to enable the reader to
di&s;tingui&s;h between an hypothe&s;is which con&s;i&s;ts
only of po&s;&s;ibilities, and a theory &s;upported by
facts; between a &s;y&s;tem, &s;uch as we are about to
give, of the formation and primitive &s;tate of the
earth, and a phy&s;ical hi&s;tory of its real condition,
which has been given in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Galileo having traced the laws of falling bo|dies,
and Kepler having ob&s;erved, that the areas
which the principal planets de&s;cribe in moving
round the &s;un, and tho&s;e of the &s;atellites round
the planets to which they belong, were propor|tioned
to the periods of their revolutions, and
that the&s;e periods were as the &s;quare roots of the
cubes of their di&s;tances from the &s;un, or from
the principal planets. Newton di&s;covered that the
power of gravity extended to the moon, and re|tained
it in its orbit; that the force of gravity
dimini&s;hed in exact proportion to the &s;quares of
the di&s;tances, and, con&s;equently, that the moon
is attracted by the earth; that the earth, and all
planets, are attracted by the &s;un; and, in gene|ral,
that all bodies which revolve about a centre,
and de&s;cribe areas proportioned to the periods of
their revolution, are attracted by that luminary.
Gravity, therefore, is a general law of nature.
The planets, comets, the &s;un, the earth, are all
&s;ubject to its laws; and it is the &s;ource of that
harmony which prevails in the univer&s;e. Nothing
<PB N="62" REF="87">
in phy&s;ics is better e&s;tabli&s;hed than the exi&s;tence
of this power in every material body. Repeated
experience has confirmed the effects of its in|fluence,
and the labour and ingenuity of geo|meters
have determined its quantity and rela|tions.</P>
<P>This general law being once di&s;covered, the
effects of it would be ea&s;ily explained, if the
action of tho&s;e bodies which produce them were
not too complicated. A &s;light view of the &s;olar
&s;y&s;tem will convince us of the difficulties which
attend this &s;ubject. The principal planets are
attracted by the &s;un, the &s;un by the planets, the
&s;atellites by the principal planets, and each pla|net
attracts all the others, and is attracted by
them. All the&s;e actions and re-actions vary ac|cording
to the quantities of matter and the di|&s;tances,
and give ri&s;e to great inequalities, and
even irregularities. How are &s;o many relations
to be combined and e&s;timated? Among &s;uch a
number of objects, how is it po&s;&s;ible to trace
any individual? The&s;e difficulties, however,
have been &s;urmounted; the rea&s;onings of theo|ry
have been confirmed by calculation; every
ob&s;ervation has produced a new demon&s;tration;
and the &s;y&s;tematic order of the univer&s;e is now
laid open to every man who is able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
truth from error.</P>
<P>The force of impul&s;ion, or what is common|ly
called the centrifugal force, is &s;till unknown;
<PB N="63" REF="88">
but it affects not the general theory. It is evi|dent,
that, as the attractive force continually
draws all the planets towards the &s;un, they
would fall in a perpendicular line into that lu|minary,
if they were not kept at a di&s;tance by
&s;ome other power, forcing them to move in a
&s;traight line. If, again, this impul&s;ive force
were not counteracted by that of attraction, all
the planets would fly off in the tangents of their
re&s;pective orbits. This progre&s;&s;ive or impul&s;ive
force was unque&s;tionably at fir&s;t communicated
to the planets by the Supreme Being. But, in
phy&s;ical &s;ubjects, we ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
to avoid having recour&s;e to &s;upernatural cau&s;es;
and, I imagine, a probable rea&s;on may be a&s;|&s;igned
for the impul&s;ive force of the planets,
which will be agreeable to the laws of mecha|nics,
and not more &s;urpri&s;ing than many revolu|tions
that mu&s;t have happened in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;phere of the &s;un's attraction is not limit|ed
by the orbits of the planets, but extends to
an indefinite di&s;tance, always decrea&s;ing accor|ding
as the &s;quares of the augmented di&s;tances.
The comets, it is evident, which e&s;cape our &s;ight
in the heavenly regions, are, like the planets,
&s;ubject to the attraction of the &s;un, and by it their
motions are regulated. All the&s;e bodies, the di|rections
of which are &s;o various, move round
the &s;un, and de&s;cribe areas proportioned to their
periods, the planets in ellip&s;es, more or le&s;s cir|cular,
and the comets, in narrow ellip&s;es of va&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="89">
extent. The motions, therefore, both of planets
and comets, are regulated by impul&s;ive and at|tractive
forces continually acting upon them,
and obliging them to de&s;cribe curves. But it is
worthy of remark, that comets run through the
&s;y&s;tem in all directions; that the inclinations of
the planes of their orbits are &s;o very different,
that though, like the planets, they be &s;ubject to
the law of attraction, they have nothing in com|mon
with regard to their progre&s;&s;ive or impul|&s;ive
motions, but appear, in this re&s;pect, to be
ab&s;olutely independent of each other. The pla|nets,
on the contrary, move round the &s;un in
the &s;ame direction, and nearly in the &s;ame
plane, the greate&s;t inclination of their planes
not exceeding 7&frac12; degrees. This &s;imilarity in
the po&s;ition and motion of the planets indicates,
that their impul&s;ive or centrifugal forces mu&s;t
have originated from one common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>May we not conjecture, that a comet falling
into the body of the &s;un might drive off &s;ome
parts from its &s;urface, and communicate to
them a violent impul&s;ive force, which they &s;till
retain? This conjecture appears to be as well
founded as that of Mr Leibnitz, which &s;uppo&s;ed
the earth and planets to have formerly been
&s;uns; and his &s;y&s;tem, of which an abridgement
will be given in art. V. would have been more
comprehen&s;ive, and more con&s;onant to probabi|lity,
if it had embraced the above idea. We
agree with him, that this effect was produced at
<PB N="65" REF="90">
the time when God is &s;aid by Mo&s;es to have &s;e|parated
the light from darkne&s;s; for, according
to Leibnitz, the light was &s;eparated from the
darkne&s;s when the planets were extingui&s;hed.
But, on our &s;uppo&s;ition, there was a real phy&s;i|cal
&s;eparation; becau&s;e the opaque bodies of the
planets were detached from the luminous mat|ter
of which the &s;un is compo&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If M. de Buffon had known, that the nucleus of the &s;un was a &s;olid and opaque matter, a di&s;covery lately made by the ingenious Dr Wil&s;on of Gla&s;gow, his hypothe&s;is would have laboured under fewer difficulties.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This notion concerning the cau&s;e of the cen|trifugal
force of the planets will appear to be
le&s;s exceptionable, after we have collected the
analogies, and e&s;timated the degrees of probabi|lity
by which it may be &s;upported. We &s;hall
fir&s;t mention, that the motion of the planets
have one common direction, namely, from we&s;t
to ea&s;t. By the doctrine of chances, it is ea&s;y
to demon&s;trate, that this circum&s;tance makes it
as 64 to 1, that the planets could not all move
in the &s;ame direction, if their centrifugal forces
had not proceeded from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This probability will be greatly augmented,
if we take in the &s;imilarity in the inclinations
of the planes of their orbits, which exceed not
7&frac12; degrees; for, by calculations it has been di&s;|covered,
that it is 24 to 1 again&s;t any two pla|nets
being found, at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t
di&s;tant parts of their orbits; and, con&s;equently,
24^5, or 7692624 to 1, that this effect could not
<PB N="66" REF="91">
be produced by accident; or, what amounts to
the &s;ame, there is this great degree of probabi|lity,
that the planets have been impre&s;&s;ed with
one common moving force, from which they
have derived this &s;ingular po&s;ition. But no|thing
could be&s;tow this common centrifugal
motion, excepting the force and direction of the
bodies by which it was originally communica|ted.
We may, therefore, conclude, that all the
planets have probably received their centrifugal
motion by one &s;ingle &s;troke. Having e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
this degree of probability, which almo&s;t a|mounts
to a certainty, I next inquire what mo|ving
bodies could produce this effect; and I can
find nothing but comets capable of communica|ting
motion to &s;uch va&s;t ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon examining the cour&s;e of comets, it is
ea&s;y to believe that &s;ome of them mu&s;t occa|&s;ionally
fall into the &s;un. The comet 1680 ap|proached
&s;o near, that, at its perihelion, it was
not more di&s;tant from the &s;un than a &s;ixteenth
part of its diameter; and, if it returns, which is
extremely probable, in the year 2255, it may
then fall into the &s;un. This mu&s;t depend upon
the accidents it meets with in its cour&s;e, and the
retardations it &s;uffers in pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;un's
atmo&s;phere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. 3. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, pre&s;ume, with the great
Newton, that comets &s;ometimes fall into the
&s;un. But they may fall in different directions.
<PB N="67" REF="92">
If they fall perpendicularly, or in a direction
not very oblique, they will remain in the body
of the &s;un, &s;erve the purpo&s;es of feuel, and, by
their impul&s;e, remove the &s;un from his place,
in proportion to the quantity of matter they
contain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quaer. Would not &s;uch an event, by augmenting the &s;un's quantity of matter, and, con&s;equently, his attractive power, pro|duce other changes in the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem?</NOTE> But, if a comet falls in a very o|blique
direction, which will mo&s;t frequently
happen, it will only graze the &s;urface, or pene|trate
to no great depth. In this ca&s;e, it may
force its way pa&s;t the &s;un, detach certain por|tions
of his body, to which it will communicate
a common impul&s;ive motion; and the&s;e portions
pu&s;hed off from the &s;un, and even the comet
it&s;elf, may turn planets, which will revolve
round this luminary in the &s;ame direction, and
nearly in the &s;ame plane. A calculation, per|haps,
might be made of the quantity of matter,
velocity, and direction, a comet ought to have,
in order to force from the &s;un ma&s;&s;es equal to
tho&s;e which compo&s;e the &s;ix planets and their
&s;atellites. But it is &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve,
that the whole planets, with their &s;atellites,
make not a 650th part of the &s;un's ma&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Newt. p. 405.</NOTE>; for,
although the den&s;ity of Saturn and Jupiter be
le&s;s than that of the &s;un, and though the earth
be four times, and the moon near five times
more den&s;e than the &s;un; yet they are only
atoms when compared to his immen&s;e volume.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="93">
It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, although a
650th part of a whole may &s;eem incon&s;iderable,
it would require a very large comet to detach
this part from the &s;un. But, if we con&s;ider the
prodigious rapidity of comets in their perihelion,
the near approach they make to the &s;un; the
den&s;ity and the &s;trong cohe&s;ion of parts nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;u&s;tain, without de&s;truction, the incon|ceivable
heat they undergo; and the &s;olid and
brilliant nucleus which &s;hines through their dark
atmo&s;pheres; it cannot be doubted that comets
are compo&s;ed of matters extremely den&s;e and
&s;olid; that they contain, in &s;mall limits, a great
quantity of matter; and, con&s;equently, that a
comet of no enormous &s;ize may remove the &s;un
from his place, and give a projectile motion to
a ma&s;s of matter equal to the 650th part of his
body. This remark corre&s;ponds with what we
know concerning the re&s;pective den&s;ities of the
planets, which always decrea&s;e in proportion to
their di&s;tances from the &s;un, having le&s;s force of
heat to re&s;i&s;t. Accordingly, Saturn is le&s;s den&s;e
than Jupiter, and Jupiter much le&s;s than the
earth. Thus, if the den&s;ity of the planets, as
Newton alledges, be in proportion to the quan|tity
of heat they &s;upport, Mercury will be &s;even
times den&s;er than the earth, and 28 times den&s;er
than the &s;un, and the comet 1680 28,000 times
more den&s;e than the earth, or 112,000 times
den&s;er than the &s;un. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing the quan|tity
of matter in this comet to be equal to a
<PB N="69" REF="94">
ninth part of the &s;un, or, allowing it to be only
100dth part of the bulk of the earth, its quanti|ty
of matter would &s;till be equal to a 900dth
part of the &s;un: Hence a body of this kind,
which would be but a &s;mall comet, might pu&s;h
off from the &s;un a 900dth or a 650th part, e&s;pe|cially
when the amazing rapidity of comets, in
their perihelion, is taken into the calculation.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondence between the den&s;ity of
the whole planets, and that of the &s;un, de&s;erves
al&s;o to be noticed. Upon and near the &s;urface
of the earth, there are &s;ub&s;tances 1400 or 1500
times den&s;er than others; the den&s;ities of air
and gold are nearly in this proportion. But the
interior parts of the earth and planets are more
uniform, and differ little with regard to den&s;ity;
and the corre&s;pondence in the den&s;ity of the
planets and that of the &s;un is &s;o great, that, out
of 650 parts, which comprehends the whole
den&s;ity of the planets, there are more than 640
nearly of the &s;ame den&s;ity with the &s;olar mat|ter;
and there are only ten of tho&s;e 650 that
are of a &s;uperior den&s;ity; for the den&s;ity of Sa|turn
and Jupiter is nearly the &s;ame with that
of the &s;un; and the quantity of matter in tho&s;e
two planets is at lea&s;t 64 times greater than
what is contained in the four inferior planets,
Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury. We
may, therefore, conclude, that, in general, the
matter of the planets is very nearly of the &s;ame
kind with the &s;olar matter, and, of cour&s;e, that
<PB N="70" REF="95">
the former may have been &s;eparated from the
latter.</P>
<P>To this theory, it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been driven off from the &s;un by a
comet, in place of de&s;cribing circles round him,
they mu&s;t, according to the law of projectiles,
have returned to the &s;ame place from whence
they had been forced; and, therefore, that the
projectile force of the planets cannot be attribu|ted
to the impul&s;e of a comet.</P>
<P>I reply, that the planets i&s;&s;ued not from the
&s;un in the form of globes, but in the form of
torrents, the motion of who&s;e anterior particles
behoved to be accelerated by tho&s;e behind, and
the attraction of the anterior particles would al|&s;o
accelerate the motion of the po&s;terior; and
that this acceleration, produced by one or both
of the&s;e cau&s;es, might be &s;uch as would nece&s;&s;a|rily
change the original motion ari&s;ing from the
impul&s;e of the comet, and that, from this cau&s;e,
might re&s;ult a motion &s;imilar to what takes place
in the planets, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered,
that the &s;hock of the comets removes the &s;un
out of its former &s;tation. This rea&s;oning may
be illu&s;trated by an example. Suppo&s;e a mu&s;ket|ball
di&s;charged from the top of a mountain,
and that the force of the powder was &s;ufficient
to pu&s;h it beyond a &s;emidiameter of the earth,
it is certain that this ball would revolve round
the earth, and return at every revolution to the
place from whence it had been di&s;charged. But,
<PB N="71" REF="96">
in&s;tead of a mu&s;ket-ball, if a rocket were em|ployed,
the continued action of the fire would
greatly accelerate the original impul&s;ive motion.
This rocket would by no means return to the
&s;ame point, like the ball; but, <HI>caeter is paribus,</HI>
would de&s;cribe an orbit, the perigee of which
would be more or le&s;s di&s;tant from the earth in
proportion to the greatne&s;s of the change pro|duced
in its direction by the accelerating force
of the fire. In the &s;ame manner, if the original
projectile force impre&s;&s;ed by the comet on the
torrent of &s;olar matter was accelerated, it is pro|bable,
that the planets formed by this torrent
acquired their circular or elliptical movements
around the &s;un.</P>
<P>The appearances exhibited in great eruptions
from volcano's may give &s;ome idea of this acce|leration
of motion. When Ve&s;uvius begins to
groan and throw out inflamed matter, it has been
often remarked, that the motion of the cloud
fir&s;t ejected is flower than the &s;ucceeding ones,
and that they go on increa&s;ing in celerity, till at
la&s;t &s;ulphur, lava, melted metal, and huge &s;tones
are thrown up; and that, though the&s;e ob&s;erve
nearly the &s;ame direction, they alter con&s;ider|ably
that of the fir&s;t cloud, and elevate it to a
greater height than it would otherwi&s;e have
reached<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rea&s;oning is ingenious; but its &s;olidity is &s;u&s;picious. The evomitions from volcano's, and the elevation the matter ac|quires, are effects of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive impul&s;es. The impul&s;e from a comet upon the &s;un mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ingle and in&s;tantaneous; which &s;eems to weaken the analogy which the author means to e&s;tabli&s;h.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="97">
The objection will be &s;till farther obviated, if
it is con&s;idered, that the impul&s;e of the comet
mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, have communicated a mo|tion
to the &s;un, and removed it from its former
&s;ituation; and that, although this motion may
now be &s;o &s;mall as to e&s;cape the notice of a&s;tro|nomers,
it may &s;till, however, exi&s;t, and make
the &s;un de&s;cribe a curve round the center of gra|vity
of the &s;y&s;tem. If this be allowed, as I pre|&s;ume
it will, the planets, in&s;tead of returning to
the &s;un's body, would de&s;cribe orbits, the peri|helions
of which would be as di&s;tant from the
&s;un as the &s;pace which he pre&s;ently occupies is
di&s;tant from his original &s;tation.</P>
<P>It may be further objected, that, if motion
be accelerated in the &s;ame direction, no change
in the perihelion could take place. But, is it
credible, that no change of direction can hap|pen
in a torrent who&s;e particles &s;ucceed each
other? On the contrary, it is extremely pro|bable,
that a change was actually produced &s;uf|ficient
to cau&s;e the planets move in their pre|&s;ent
orbits.</P>
<P>It may &s;till be objected, that, if the &s;ituation
of the &s;un had been changed by the &s;hock of a
comet, it would move uniformly; and, of cour&s;e,
this motion being common to the whole &s;y&s;tem,
no alteration would be effected. But, previous
to the &s;hock, might not the &s;un move round
<PB N="73" REF="98">
the centre of the cometary &s;y&s;tem; and might
not this primary motion be augmented or dimi|ni&s;hed
by the &s;troke of the comet? Is not
this &s;ufficient to account for the actual motion
of the planets?</P>
<P>If none of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions be admitted,
may it not be pre&s;umed, that the ela&s;ticity of the
&s;un might elevate the torrent above his &s;urface,
in place of pu&s;hing it directly forward? This of
it&s;elf would be &s;ufficient to remove the perihe|lion,
and endow the planets with their pre&s;ent
movements. Neither is this &s;uppo&s;ition de&s;ti|tute
of foundation: The &s;olar matter may be
exceedingly ela&s;tic; &s;ince light, the only part
of it we are acquainted with, &s;eems, by its ef|fects,
to be perfectly ela&s;tic. I acknowledge
that I cannot determine which of the cau&s;es a|bove
a&s;&s;igned has actually produced an altera|tion
in the projectile force of the planets; but
they at lea&s;t &s;how that &s;uch a change is not
only po&s;&s;ible, but probable; and this is enough
for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Without farther in&s;i&s;ting on the objections
that may be made again&s;t my hypothe&s;is, or the
analogical proofs that might be brought in &s;up|port
of it, I &s;hall pro&s;ecute my &s;ubject, and draw
the proper conclu&s;ions. Let us fir&s;t examine
what might happen to the planets, and particu|larly
to the earth, when they were impre&s;&s;ed
with their projectile forces, and what was their
&s;tate after their &s;eparation from the body of the
<PB N="74" REF="99">
&s;un. A projectile motion having been commu|nicated
by the &s;troke of a comet, to a quantity
of matter equal to a 650th part of the &s;un's
ma&s;s, the light particles would &s;eparate from
the den&s;e, and, by their mutual attractions, form
globes of different &s;olidities. Saturn being com|po&s;ed
of the large&s;t and lighte&s;t parts, would be
removed to the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;un;
Jupiter, being den&s;er than Saturn, would have
a nearer &s;tation; and &s;o of the re&s;t. The large&s;t
and lea&s;t &s;olid planets are mo&s;t di&s;tant, be|cau&s;e
they received a greater projectile force
than the &s;maller and den&s;er; for the projectile
force being proportioned to the &s;urfaces to which
it is applied, the &s;ame &s;troke would make the
larger and lighter parts of the &s;olar matter move
with more rapidity than the &s;maller and hea|vier.
The parts, therefore, which differed in
den&s;ity would &s;eparate from each other in &s;uch
a manner, that, if the den&s;ity of the &s;olar matter
be equal to 100, that of Saturn will be equal to
67, of Jupiter, &equals; 94&frac12;, of Mars, &equals; 200, of the
Earth, &equals; 400, of Venus, &equals; 800, of Mercury,
&equals; 2800. But, as the attractive force acts not
in proportion to the &s;urface, but to the quantity
of matter, it would retard the progre&s;s of the
more den&s;e parts of the &s;olar matter; and it is
for this rea&s;on that we find the mo&s;t den&s;e pla|nets
neare&s;t the &s;un, and which move round
him with more rapidity than tho&s;e that are more
di&s;tant, and le&s;s den&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="100">
The den&s;ity and projectile motion of Saturn
and Jupiter, the two large&s;t planets in the &s;y&s;tem,
have the mo&s;t exact proportion. The den&s;ity
of Saturn is to that of Jupiter as 67 to 94&frac12;, and
their velocities are nearly as 88&frac23; to 120 1/72, or as
67 to 90 11/16;. How rarely do pure conjectures
corre&s;pond &s;o exactly to the phaenomena of na|ture?
It is true, according to this relation be|tween
the celerity and den&s;ity of the planets,
the den&s;ity of the earth ought not to exceed
206 7/18, in&s;tead of 400, which is its real den&s;ity;
hence it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the earth has now
double its original den&s;ity. With regard to the
other planets, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as
their den&s;ities are only conjectural, we know
not whether this circum&s;tance would confirm or
weaken our hypothe&s;is. Newton &s;ays, that the
den&s;ities of the planets are proportioned to the
degrees of heat they are expo&s;ed to; and, it is
in con&s;equence of this idea, that we have men|tioned
Mars as being one time le&s;s den&s;e than
the earth, Venus one time, Mercury &s;even times,
and the comet 1680, 28,000 times den&s;er than
the earth. But, if we attend to Saturn and Ju|piter,
the two principal planets, we will find,
that this &s;uppo&s;ed proportion between the den|&s;ities
of the planets, and the heat they &s;u&s;tain, is
not well founded: For, according to this hy|pothe&s;is,
the den&s;ity of Saturn would be as 4 7/18,
and that of Jupiter as 14 17/22, in&s;tead of the pro|portions
of 67 and 94&frac12;; differences &s;o great as
<PB N="76" REF="101">
to de&s;troy the principles upon which they are
founded. Thus, notwith&s;tanding the regard due
to the conjectures of Newton, I cannot help
thinking that the den&s;ities of the planets have a
nearer relation to their celerities than to the de|grees
of heat to which they are expo&s;ed. This,
indeed, is only a final cau&s;e; but the other is a
phy&s;ical relation, the exactne&s;s of which is re|markable
in Saturn and Jupiter. It is, however,
certain, that the den&s;ity of the earth, in&s;tead of
being 206&frac78;, is 400; and, con&s;equently, the earth
mu&s;t have &s;uffered a conden&s;ation in the propor|tion
of 206&frac12; to 400.</P>
<P>But, have the conden&s;ations of the planets no
relation to the quantity of &s;olar heat they &s;u|&s;tain?
In that ca&s;e, Saturn, which is at the
greate&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;un, would have &s;uf|fered
little or no conden&s;ation; and Jupiter
would be conden&s;ed from 90 11/16 to 94&frac12;. Now,
the &s;un's heat in Jupiter being to his heat in the
earth as 14 17/22 to 400, their conden&s;ation ought
to be in the &s;ame proportion. Thus, if Jupiter
be conden&s;ed as 90 11/16 to 94&frac12;, the earth, if it
had been in the orbit of Jupiter, would have
been conden&s;ed from 206&frac78; to 215 990/1452; but the
earth being much nearer the &s;un, and receiving
heat, in proportion to that of Jupiter, as 400 to
14 17/22, the quantity of conden&s;ation it would
have undergone in the orbit of Jupiter mu&s;t be
multiplied by the proportion of 400 to 14 17/22,
which will give nearly 234&frac13; for the conden&s;a|tion
<PB N="77" REF="102">
the earth mu&s;t have received. The den&s;ity
of the earth was 206&frac78;; by adding its acquired
conden&s;ation, its actual den&s;ity will be 400&frac78;,
which is nearly the &s;ame with 400, its real den|&s;ity
determined by the moon's parallax. With
regard to the other planets, I pretend not to give
exact proportions, but only approximations,
tending to &s;how, that their den&s;ities have a
&s;trong connection with the celerity of their mo|tions
in their re&s;pective orbits.</P>
<P>The comet, by falling obliquely on the &s;un,
as mentioned above, mu&s;t have forced off from
his &s;urface a quantity of matter equal to a 650th
part of his body. This matter being in a liquid
&s;tate, would at fir&s;t form a torrent, of which the
large&s;t and rare&s;t parts would fly to the greate&s;t
di&s;tances; the &s;maller and more den&s;e, having re|ceived
only an equal impul&s;e, would remain
nearer the &s;un; his power of attraction would
operate upon all the parts detached from his
body, and make them circulate round him; and,
at the &s;ame time, the mutual attraction of the
particles of matter would cau&s;e all the detached
parts to take on the form of globes, at differ|ent
di&s;tances from the &s;un, the nearer moving
with greater rapidity in their orbits than the
more remote.</P>
<P>But, to this it may be objected, that, if the
planets had been detached from the &s;un, they
mu&s;t have been burning and luminous, not cold
and opaque bodies; nothing can have le&s;s re|&s;emblance
<PB N="78" REF="103">
to a globe of fire than a globe com|po&s;ed
of earth and water; and, by compari&s;on,
the matter of the earth is totally different from
that of the &s;un.</P>
<P>It may be replied to this objection, that the
matter changed its form upon its &s;eparation, and
that the fire, or light, was extingui&s;hed by the
projectile motion communicated by the &s;troke.
Be&s;ides, may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;un, or
a burning &s;tar, moving with a rapidity equal to
that of the planets, would &s;oon be extingui&s;hed;
and that this may be the rea&s;on why all the
luminous, or burning &s;tars, are fixed, and with|out
motion; and why tho&s;e called new &s;tars,
which have probably changed their &s;tations, are
frequently extingui&s;hed and di&s;appear? To con|firm
this remark, comets, when in their perihe|lia,
ought to be inflamed even to their center;
but they never become luminous &s;tars; they on|ly
emit a burning vapour, a con&s;iderable portion
of which they leave behind them in their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In a medium which has little re&s;i&s;tance, I ac|knowledge,
that fire may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, although the
burning body be moved with great rapidity. It
mu&s;t likewi&s;e be acknowledged, that what I have
&s;aid applies only to tho&s;e &s;tars which di&s;appear
for ever, not to tho&s;e that appear and di&s;appear
at &s;tated intervals, without changing their &s;itua|tions
in the heavens. Of the&s;e Maupertuis, in
his di&s;cour&s;e on the figure of the &s;tars, has
given a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory account. But tho&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="104">
which have appeared, and then vani&s;hed for
ever, mu&s;t unque&s;tionably have been extin|gui&s;hed
either by the quickne&s;s of their motion,
or &s;ome other cau&s;e. There is not a &s;ingle ex|ample
of a luminous &s;tar revolving round an|other;
and not one of the &s;ixteen planets
which revolve round the &s;un have any light in
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Farther, fire, in &s;mall ma&s;&s;es, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t
&s;o long as in large ones. The planets would
burn a con&s;iderable time after they i&s;&s;ued from
the &s;un; but, at length, would extingui&s;h for
want of combu&s;tible matter. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on,
the &s;un it&s;elf will be extingui&s;hed; but at a
period as much beyond that which extingui&s;hed
the planets, as the quantity of matter in the &s;un
exceeds that of the planets. However this may
be, the &s;eparation of the planets from the &s;un,
by the &s;hock of a comet, appears &s;ufficient to
account for their extinction.</P>
<P>The earth and planets, when they i&s;&s;ued from
the &s;un, were totally compo&s;ed of liquid fire; in
which &s;tate they would continue no longer than
the violence of the heat that kept them in fu&s;ion.
But this heat would gradually decay from the
moment they left the &s;un. During their fluid
&s;tate, they nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;umed circular fi|gures;
and their diurnal motion would elevate
their equators, and flatten their poles. I agree
with M. Leibnitz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Act. Erud. Lip&s;. an. 1692.</NOTE>, that this figure corre&s;ponds
<PB N="80" REF="105">
&s;o exactly with the laws of hydro&s;tatics, that the
earth and planets mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been
once in a &s;tate of fluidity occa&s;ioned by fire;
and con&s;equently, that the interior parts of the
earth mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of vitrified matter, of
which &s;and, free-&s;tone, granite, and perhaps
clay, are fragments, or &s;coriae.</P>
<P>It is therefore extremely probable, that the
planets were originally parts of the &s;un &s;epa|rated
by a &s;troke which communicated to them
a projectile motion; and that their different
di&s;tances proceeded &s;olely from the difference of
their den&s;ities. To compleat this theory, it on|ly
remains to account for the diurnal motion of
the planets, and the origin of their &s;atellites;
and this, in&s;tead of adding fre&s;h difficulties, will
tend greatly to confirm my hypothe&s;is: For ro|tation,
or what is called diurnal motion, entire|ly
depends on the obliquity of the &s;troke; an
oblique impul&s;e on the &s;urface of a body nece&s;|&s;arily
gives it a rotatory motion. If the body
which receives the impul&s;e be homogeneous, the
rotatory motion will always be equal and uni|form;
but it will be unequal, if the body con|&s;i&s;t
of heterogeneous parts, or of parts different
in den&s;ity. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of each planet is homogeneous, becau&s;e
the diurnal motion of each is uniformly per|formed
in the &s;ame time; and this circum&s;tance
is an additional proof, that portions of different
den&s;ities were originally &s;eparated from the &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="106">
But the obliquity of the &s;troke might be &s;o
great as to throw off &s;mall quantities of matter
from the principal planet, which would nece&s;|&s;arily
move in the &s;ame direction. The&s;e parts,
by mutual attraction, would reunite, according
to their den&s;ities, at different di&s;tances from the
planet, follow its cour&s;e round the &s;un, and at
the &s;ame time revolve about the body of the
planet, nearly in the plane of its orbit. It is ea&s;y
to perceive that the portions we mean are the
&s;atellites: Thus the formation, po&s;ition, and
motion of the &s;atellites corre&s;pond, in the mo&s;t
perfect manner, with our theory; for they all
move in the &s;ame direction, and in concentric
circles round their principal planets, and nearly
in the plane of their orbits. All the&s;e common
effects, depending on an impul&s;ive force, mu&s;t
have proceeded from a common cau&s;e, which
was a projectile force communicated to them by
the &s;ame oblique &s;troke. This account of the
motion and formation of the &s;atellites will be
&s;trongly &s;upported, if the other circum&s;tances
and phaenomena attending them be duly weigh|ed.
Tho&s;e planets that are furni&s;hed with &s;atel|lites,
move quicke&s;t round their axes. The re|volution
of the earth is quicker than that of Mars,
in the proportion nearly of 24 to 15; the earth
has a &s;atellite, and Mars has none; Jupiter;
who&s;e diurnal motion is 500 or 600 times more
rapid than that of the earth, has four &s;atellites;
and it is extremely probable, that Saturn, who
<PB N="82" REF="107">
has five &s;atellites and a ring, revolves much more
quickly than Jupiter.</P>
<P>We may even conjecture, with &s;ome proba|bility,
that the plane of the equator of Saturn's
ring is nearly the &s;ame with that of the planet;
for, &s;uppo&s;ing, according to the preceding theory,
the obliquity of the impul&s;e which put Saturn
in motion to have been very great, his diurnal
motion would at fir&s;t be in proportion to the
exce&s;s of the centrifugal force above that of gra|vity,
and, of cour&s;e, a con&s;iderable quantity of
matter would be thrown off from his equatorial
regions, and nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;ume the figure of a
ring, the plane of which would be nearly the
&s;ame with that of his own equator. This quan|tity
of matter detached from the equatorial re|gions
of Saturn, mu&s;t have flattened the equator
of that planet; which is the rea&s;on why, not|with&s;tanding
the rapidity with which we have
&s;uppo&s;ed him to revolve round his axis, the di|ameters
of Saturn are not &s;o unequal as tho&s;e of
Jupiter, which differ from each other more than
an eleventh part.</P>
<P>Though this theory of the formation of the
planets and their &s;atellites appears to be extreme|ly
probable; yet, as every man has his own
&s;tandard of e&s;timating probabilities of this na|ture,
and as this &s;tandard varies according to the
different capacities of combining analogies more
or le&s;s remote, I pretend not to convince tho&s;e
who are unwilling to believe. I have offered tho&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="108">
ideas to the public, not only becau&s;e I thought
them rational, and calculated to unravel a &s;ub|ject
upon which, however important, nothing
has hitherto been written; but becau&s;e the im|pul&s;ive
motion of the planets gives ri&s;e to num|berle&s;s
phaenomena in the univer&s;e, which ad|mit
not of an explanation by gravity alone. To
tho&s;e who may be di&s;po&s;ed to deny the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of my theory, I would propo&s;e the follow|ing
queries:</P>
<P>1. Is it not natural to imagine, that a moving
body has received its motion from the impul&s;e
of &s;ome other body?</P>
<P>2. When &s;everal bodies move in the &s;ame di|rection,
is it not exceedingly probable, that they
received this direction from a &s;ingle &s;troke, or,
at lea&s;t, from &s;trokes every way &s;imilar?</P>
<P>3. When &s;everal bodies in motion have not
only the &s;ame direction, but are placed in the
&s;ame plane, is it not more natural to think that
they received this direction and po&s;ition from
one impul&s;e than from many?</P>
<P>4. Is it not probable, that a body put in mo|tion
by impul&s;e, &s;hould receive it in an oblique
direction; and con&s;equently that it &s;hould be
forced to move round its axis with a rapidity
proportioned to the obliquity of the &s;troke? If
the&s;e queries be not unrea&s;onable, the theory of
which we have given a &s;ketch will no longer
have the appearance of ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="109">
Let us now proceed to a more intere&s;ting ob|ject;
let us examine the figure of the earth,
upon which &s;o many inquiries and ob&s;ervations
have been made. As it appears, from the e|quality
of the earth's diurnal motion, and the
uniformity in the inclination of its axis, that it
is compo&s;ed of homogeneous parts which mu|tually
attract each other in proportion to their
quantities of matter; if its impul&s;ive motion
had been communicated in a direction perpen|dicular
to its &s;urface, it would nece&s;&s;arily have
a&s;&s;umed the figure of a perfect &s;phere: But,
having been &s;truck obliquely, it moved round
its axis at the in&s;tant it received its figure; and,
from the combination of the projectile force and
that of attraction, there re&s;ulted a &s;pheroid fi|gure,
more elevated at the equator than at the
poles; becau&s;e the centrifugal force, ari&s;ing from
the diurnal rotation of the earth, mu&s;t dimini&s;h
the action of gravity, or that power which makes
all the parts tend to the centre. Thus the earth,
being compo&s;ed of homogeneous parts, and ha|ving
been endowed with a rotatory motion,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a&s;&s;umed a &s;pheroidal
figure, the two axes of which differ from each
other by a 230th part. To &s;how that this is the
real figure of the earth, we need not have re|cour&s;e
to hypothe&s;es; it is capable of the clear|e&s;t
demon&s;tration. The laws of gravitation are
well known: That bodies attract each other di|rectly
<PB N="85" REF="110">
as their quantities of matter, and inver&s;e|ly
as the &s;quares of their di&s;tances, admits not
of a doubt. It can as little be doubted, that the
total action of any body is compo&s;ed of all the
particular actions of its parts.</P>
<P>The parts of bodies are all mutually attracted
in the above proportion; and all the&s;e attractions,
when the body has no rotation, nece&s;&s;arily pro|duce
a &s;phere, and a &s;pheroid, when the body is
endowed with a rotatory motion. This &s;pheroid is
more or le&s;s flattened at the poles in proportion
to the quickne&s;s of its diurnal motion; and the
earth, in con&s;equence of the celerity of its ro|tation,
and the mutual attraction of its parts,
has a&s;&s;umed the figure of a &s;pheroid, of which
the two axes are to one another as 229 to 230.</P>
<P>Thus the earth, at the time of its formation,
from the original con&s;titution and homogeneity
of its parts, and independent of every hypothe|&s;is
derived from the direction of gravity, took
the figure of a &s;pheroid; and, from the known
laws of mechanics, its equatorial diameter was
nece&s;&s;arily elevated about &s;ix leagues and a half
more than its poles.</P>
<P>I &s;hall dwell the longer on this article, be|cau&s;e
there are &s;ome geometers, who, from a
&s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy they have adopted, and
from a &s;uppo&s;ed direction of gravity, &s;till ima|gine
that the figure of the earth depends upon
theory. The fir&s;t thing to be demon&s;trated is
<PB N="86" REF="111">
the mutual attraction of the parts of matter;
and the &s;econd, the homogeneity of the terre&s;tri|al
globe. When the&s;e two facts are clearly pro|ved,
there will be no occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e
to any theory derived from the direction of
gravity; becau&s;e the earth's figure, in this ca&s;e,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be as Newton determined it;
and all the other figures a&s;&s;igned to it in con&s;e|quence
of vortexes, and other hypothe&s;es, can
have no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It will not be doubted, even by the mo&s;t in|credulous,
that the planets are retained in their
orbits by the power of gravity. The &s;atellites
of Saturn gravitate towards that planet, tho&s;e of
Jupiter towards Jupiter; the moon gravitates
towards the earth; and Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,
the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, gravitate to|wards
the &s;un. In the &s;ame manner, Saturn,
Jupiter, and the Earth, gravitate towards their
re&s;pective &s;atellites, and the &s;un gravitates to|wards
the whole planets. Gravitation is there|fore
a general law, by which the whole planetary
&s;y&s;tem is mutually affected; for action cannot
exi&s;t without re-action. This mutual attraction
of the planets is the law which regulates all their
motions; and its exi&s;tence is demon&s;trated by its
effects. When Saturn and Jupiter are in con|junction,
their mutual attraction produces an
irregularity in their motion round the &s;un. The
earth and the moon, al&s;o, mutually attract each
other; But the irregularities in the moon's mo|tion
<PB N="87" REF="112">
proceed principally from the attraction of
the &s;un; and hence the &s;un, the earth, and the
moon, mutually act upon each other. Now, the
reciprocal attraction of the planets, when the
di&s;tances are equal, is proportioned to their quan|tities
of matter; and the &s;ame power of gravi|ty,
which makes heavy bodies fall to the earth,
and which extends as far as the moon, is like|wi&s;e
in proportion to the quantity of matter:
The total gravity of a planet, therefore, is com|po&s;ed
of the gravity of all its parts: Hence all
the parts of matter, whether in the earth or pla|nets,
mutually attract each other; and, of cour&s;e,
the rotation of the earth round its axis mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily have be&s;towed on it the figure of a
&s;pheroid, the axes of which are are as 229 to 230.
But the direction of gravity mu&s;t be perpendicular
to the earth's &s;urface; and, con&s;equently, unle&s;s
the general and mutual attraction of the parts
of matter be denied, no hypothe&s;is derived from
the direction of gravity can have any &s;olid foun|dation.
But this mutual attraction, as we have
&s;een, is demon&s;trated by actual ob&s;ervation;
and the experiments made by pendulums prove
its univer&s;al exten&s;ion. No hypothe&s;is, there|fore,
founded on the direction of gravity, can
be admitted, without contradicting both rea&s;on
and experience.</P>
<P>Let us now examine whether the parts com|po&s;ing
the terre&s;trial globe be homogeneous. I
acknowledge, that, if the globe be &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="88" REF="113">
con&s;i&s;t of parts different in den&s;ity, the direction
of gravity would be different from that we have
a&s;&s;igned, and that the earth's figure would vary
according to the different &s;uppo&s;itions that might
be made concerning the direction of gravity.
But, why make &s;uppo&s;itions of this kind? Why,
for example, do we &s;uppo&s;e the parts near the
center to be more den&s;e than tho&s;e more di&s;tant
from it? Are not all the particles which compo&s;e
the globe united by their mutual attraction?
Every particle, therefore, is a centre; and there
is no rea&s;on to believe that the parts which &s;ur|round
the centre are den&s;er than tho&s;e which
&s;urround any other point. Be&s;ides, if any con|&s;iderable
part of the earth were more den&s;e than
another, the axis of rotation would approach
nearer that part, and create an inequality in the
diurnal revolution of the globe: It would pro|duce
an inequality in the apparent motion of the
fixed &s;tars; they would appear to move more
quickly or &s;lowly in the zenith or horizon, ac|cording
as we happened to be &s;ituated on the
heavy or light parts of the earth; and the axis
of the globe not pa&s;&s;ing through its centre of
gravity, would make a perceptible change in its
po&s;ition. But nothing of this kind ever takes
place. On the contrary, the diurnal revolution
of the earth is equal and uniform. At every
point of the earth's &s;urface, the &s;tars appear to
move with the &s;ame quickne&s; and, if there be
any rotation in its axis, it is too incon&s;iderable
<PB N="89" REF="114">
to attract ob&s;ervation. Hence it may be con|cluded,
that all the parts of the globe are at lea&s;t
nearly homogeneous.</P>
<P>If the earth were hollow, the cru&s;t of which,
for example, exceeded not three leagues in thick|ne&s;s,
it would give ri&s;e to the following phae|nomena.
1. The mountains would bear &s;o
great a proportion to the total thickne&s;s of the
cru&s;t, that va&s;t irregularities in the earth's mo|tion
would be occa&s;ioned by the attraction of
the moon and of the &s;un: When the moon was
in the meridian of the more elevated parts, as
the Cordeliers, her attraction upon the whole
globe would be much greater, than when &s;he
was in the meridian of the lower parts. 2. The
comparative attraction of the mountains would
be greatly increa&s;ed; and the experiments made
on Mount Chimboraco in Peru, would have gi|ven
more degrees in the deviation of the plumb
line than they actually gave &s;econds. 3. The
weight of bodies would be greater on the tops
of mountains than in the plains; and men would
find them&s;elves more weighty, and would walk
with more difficulty in high than in low grounds.
The&s;e ob&s;ervations, and many others that might
be made, &s;hould convince us, that the interior
parts of the earth are not hollow, but that they
are compo&s;ed of matter of a con&s;iderable den|&s;ity.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the earth, at the depth
of two or three leagues, con&s;i&s;ted of matter
<PB N="90" REF="115">
much den&s;er than that we are acquainted with,
upon de&s;cending even into ordinary pits, we &s;hould
find our&s;elves con&s;iderably heavier; and the
motion of pendulums would there be more ac|celerated
than they actually are when brought
down from a hill to a plain. Hence we may
pre&s;ume, that the interior parts of the earth con|&s;i&s;t
of matter nearly &s;imilar to that on its &s;ur|face.
Of this, we will be &s;till further convinced,
if we con&s;ider, that the earth, at the time of its
original formation, when it a&s;&s;umed its pre&s;ent
&s;pheroidal figure, was in a &s;tate of fu&s;ion, and,
con&s;equently, that all its parts were homogeneous,
and nearly of equal den&s;ity. The matter on
the &s;urface, though originally the &s;ame with that
of the interior parts, has, in the revolutions of
time, undergone many changes from external
cau&s;es; and to the&s;e are to be a&s;cribed the pro|duction
of materials &s;o different in their den&s;i|ties.
But it ought to be remarked, that the
den&s;e&s;t bodies, as gold, and other metals, are
mo&s;t rarely to be met with; and, con&s;equently,
that the greate&s;t quantity of materials, at the
&s;urface, have &s;uffered little alteration with re|gard
to den&s;ity. The mo&s;t common materials,
indeed, as &s;and and clay, differ &s;o little in den&s;i|ty,
that we may conjecture, with much proba|bility,
the internal parts of the earth to con&s;i&s;t
of a vitrified matter, the den&s;ity of which is
nearly equal to that of &s;and; and, con&s;equently,
<PB N="91" REF="116">
that the whole globe may be con&s;idered as one
homogeneous ma&s;s.</P>
<P>But, it may be &s;aid, that, though the earth
were compo&s;ed of concentric beds, of different
den&s;ities, the equality of its diurnal motion, and
the uniform inclination of its axis, would re|main
equally undi&s;turbed, as upon the &s;uppo&s;i|tion
of its con&s;i&s;ting wholly of homogeneous
matter. This I allow; but I demand, at the
&s;ame time, whether there be any rea&s;on for be|lieving,
that the&s;e beds of different den&s;ities
really exi&s;t? Whether this method of &s;olving
difficulties be not an attempt to adju&s;t the works
of nature to our own imaginations? And whe|ther
&s;uppo&s;itions, neither founded on ob&s;ervation
nor analogy, ought to find admittance into phy|&s;ics?</P>
<P>It is, then, apparent, that the earth received
its &s;pheroidal figure in con&s;equence of its diurnal
motion, and the mutual attraction of its parts;
that this figure nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulted from the
globe's being in a liquid &s;tate; that, according
to the laws of gravity and of a centrifugal force,
it could not po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume any other figure;
that, at the moment of its formation, the diffe|rence
between its two diameters was, as at pre|&s;ent,
equal to a 230th part; and, of cour&s;e, that
all other hypothe&s;es which make this difference
greater or le&s;s, are mere fictions, and de&s;erve no
attention.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="117">
Perhaps it may be objected, that, if this theo|ry
be well founded, and if the proportion of the
axes of the two diameters be as 229 to 230,
how came the mathematicians &s;ent to Lapland
and Peru to concur in making it as 174 to 175?
Why &s;hould &s;uch a difference &s;ub&s;i&s;t between
practice and theory? And, is it not more rea|&s;onable
to give the preference to actual mea&s;ure|ment,
e&s;pecially when executed by the able&s;t
mathematicians in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Maupertuis, figure de la terre.</NOTE>, and furni&s;hed with
all the nece&s;&s;ary apparatus?</P>
<P>To this I reply, that I mean not to combat
the ob&s;ervations made at the equator, and near
the pole; that I doubt not of their exactne&s;s; and
that the earth may actually be elevated a 175th
part more at the equator than at the poles. Still,
however, I maintain my theory; and I perceive
clearly how it may be reconciled to practice.
The difference between the two conclu&s;ions is
about four leagues in the two axes. The equa|torial
regions are found to have an elevation of
two leagues more than they ought to have by
the theory. This heighth of two leagues cor|re&s;ponds
exactly with the greate&s;t inequalities
which have been produced on the &s;urface of the
globe by the motion of the &s;ea, and the action
of fluids. This requires illu&s;tration. At the
time of the earth's formation, in con&s;equence of
the mutual attraction of its parts, and of its cen|trifugal
force, it mu&s;t have a&s;&s;umed a &s;pheroidal
<PB N="93" REF="118">
figure, with its axes different by a 230th part.
This would be the real figure of the earth while
it remained in a &s;tate of liquifaction. But, af|ter
cooling for &s;ome time, the rarified vapours,
like tho&s;e in the tail or atmo&s;phere of a comet,
would conden&s;e, and fall on the &s;urface in the
form of air and water; and, when the&s;e waters
began to be agitated by a flux and reflux, &s;and,
and other bodies, would be gradually tran&s;ported
from the poles towards the equatorial parts.
This operation, when continued for &s;ome time,
would nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink the poles, and elevate the
equator in the &s;ame proportion. The &s;urface of
the earth being likewi&s;e expo&s;ed to the winds,
to the action of the air and of the &s;un; all the&s;e
cau&s;es would concur with the tides in furrow|ting
the earth, in &s;cooping out vallies, in eleva|ing
the mountains, and in producing other &s;u|perficial
irregularities, none of which, perhaps,
exceed a league in thickne&s;s, even at the equa|tor.
This inequality of two leagues may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the greate&s;t that can take place
on the &s;urface; for the highe&s;t mountains ex|ceed
not a league in height; and the mo&s;t pro|found
parts of the ocean, it is probable, are not
above a league in depth. Thus my theory per|fectly
coincides with practice. The earth's e|quator
could not, at fir&s;t, be elevated more than
&s;ix leagues and a half above the poles; but the
changes produced on the &s;urface might give it
a &s;till greater elevation. Natural hi&s;tory won|derfully
<PB N="94" REF="119">
&s;upports this opinion; for, in the pre|ceding
di&s;cour&s;e, we have proved, that, from
the tides and other motions of the waters, have
proceeded mountains, and all the other inequa|lities
on the &s;urface of the globe; and that, at
great depths, as well as upon the greate&s;t
heights, bones, &s;hells, and other relicts of &s;ea
and land animals, have been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>From what has been ob&s;erved, it may be con|jectured,
that, in order to find primitive earth,
and &s;ub&s;tances which have never been removed
from their original &s;tations, we mu&s;t dig in
countries near the poles, where the bed of
unmoved earth will be thinner than in &s;outhern
climates.</P>
<P>In fine, if the mea&s;urement by which the fi|gure
of the earth was determined be &s;trictly
&s;crutinized, we &s;hall find that it is not altogether
free from hypothetical rea&s;oning: For it pro|ceeded
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the earth was a
regular curve: But, as the earth is liable to con|&s;iderable
and con&s;tant changes from a thou&s;and
cau&s;es, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it could have retained
any perfectly regular figure; and hence, agree|able
to our theory, and the opinion of Newton,
the poles might originally be only flattened a
230th part. Be&s;ides, though we had the exact
length of a degree at the equator and polar
circle, yet, have we not likewi&s;e the exact length
of a degree in France? and the mea&s;ures of M.
Picard have never been confirmed. It may be
<PB N="95" REF="120">
added, that the diminution and increa&s;e in the
motion of the pendulum agree not with the con|clu&s;ions
drawn from mea&s;urement; and that, on
the contrary, they corre&s;pond very nearly to the
theory of Newton. The&s;e circum&s;tances tend
farther to convince us, that the poles are not de|pre&s;&s;ed
above a 230th part; and that, if there
be any difference, it can proceed from nothing
but the inequalities produced on the &s;urface by
the waters, and other external cau&s;es. But the&s;e
inequalities are by no means &s;o regular as to
ju&s;tify any hypothe&s;is which &s;uppo&s;es the meri|dians
to be ellip&s;es, or any other perfect curves.
Hence it appears, that, though many degrees
&s;hould be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively mea&s;ured in different re|gions,
we cannot, by that alone, a&s;certain the
exact depre&s;&s;ion of the poles, nor determine how
much it exceeds or falls &s;hort of a 230th part.</P>
<P>May we not likewi&s;e conjecture, that, if the
inclination of the earth's axis has been changed,
this effect could not be produced but by the
changes on the &s;urface, &s;ince all the other parts
are homogeneous; that this variation is, of
cour&s;e, too &s;mall to be perceived by a&s;trono|mers;
and that, if the earth be not di&s;turbed by
a comet, or &s;ome other external cau&s;e, its axis
will for ever pre&s;erve its pre&s;ent and original
inclination?</P>
<P>Not to omit any conjecture that &s;eems rea|&s;onable,
may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that, as the moun|tains,
and other inequalities on the &s;urface of
<PB N="96" REF="121">
the earth, have originated from the action of
the tides, tho&s;e which we perceive in the moon
have been produced by a &s;imilar cau&s;e? The
mountains of the moon are indeed higher than
tho&s;e of the earth; but her tides are likewi&s;e
&s;tronger; becau&s;e the earth, the &s;ize of which is
much larger, produces the tides of the moon
with &s;uperior force. This effect would be great|ly
augmented, if the moon, like the earth, had
a quick diurnal motion. But, as the moon uni|formly
pre&s;ents the &s;ame face to the earth, the
tides are rai&s;ed only in proportion to the mo|tion
occa&s;ioned by her librations, which alter|nately
expo&s;e to our view a &s;mall &s;egment of
her other hemi&s;phere. This cau&s;e, however,
mu&s;t produce tides very different from tho&s;e of
our &s;eas; and their effects will, of cour&s;e, be
much le&s;s con&s;iderable, than if the moon had
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a diurnal revolution round her axis,
equally quick as the rotation of the earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hould compo&s;e a volume equal to that of
Burnet or Whi&s;ton, were I to extend the ideas
pre&s;ented by the above theory; and were I, in
imitation of the la&s;t mentioned author, to clothe
them in a geometrical dre&s;s, I might add con&s;i|derably
to their importance. But I have always
thought, that hypothe&s;es, however probable, de|&s;erve
not to be treated &s;o pompou&s;ly; it is apt to
give them the air of quackery and impo&s;ition.</P>

exact or philo&s;ophic account of the creation and

narrative of the formation of the terre&s;trial globe.
The earth, in his e&s;timation, formerly exi&s;ted in

only received a form, &s;ituation, and con&s;i&s;tence,
nece&s;&s;ary for the habitation of mankind. I

which will &s;how it to be contrary to the &s;crip|tures,

year were the &s;ame, and con&s;i&s;ted exactly of 360
days; that a comet, de&s;cending in the plane of
the ecliptic to its perihelion, on the very day that
the deluge began, made a near approach to the
earth; that there is a great heat in the bowels
of the earth, which is con&s;tantly expanding
from the centre to the circumference; that the
figure of the earth re&s;embles an egg; that the
mountains are the lighte&s;t parts of the globe,
&amp;c. He then attributes to the deluge all the
changes the earth has undergone, blindly adopts
Woodward's theory, u&s;es indi&s;criminately all
that author's remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the
earth; but a&s;&s;umes more the air of an original,
when he treats of its future condition. The
earth, &s;ays Mr Whi&s;ton, will be con&s;umed by
&s;ire; and its de&s;truction will be preceded by
earthquakes, thunder, and hideous meteors; the
&s;un and moon will a&s;&s;ume a dreadful a&s;pect; the
heavens will &s;eem to fall; and the whole earth
will be in flames. But, after the fire &s;hall have
devoured every impurity of this globe, and vi|trified
and rendered it tran&s;parent as the pure&s;t
cry&s;tal, the &s;aints and &s;pirits of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and there remain till the
general judgment.</P>
<P>This hypothe&s;is appears, at fir&s;t view, to be
extravagant and fanta&s;tical. But the author has
managed his ideas with &s;uch dexterity, and pla|ced
them in &s;o &s;trong a light, that they no long|er
have the air of ab&s;olute chimeras. He has
<PB N="100" REF="125">
adorned his &s;ubject with much &s;cience and in|genuity:
And it is a&s;toni&s;hing, that, from &s;uch
a medley of &s;trange notions, he &s;hould have
been able to compo&s;e a &s;y&s;tem &s;o plau&s;ible. But
it is not to the vulgar that it has this brilliant
appearance; the learned are more ea&s;ily de|ceived
by the glare of erudition, and the force
of new ideas. Mr Whi&s;ton was a celebrated a|&s;tronomer.
Accu&s;tomed to contemplate the hea|vens,
to mea&s;ure the motions of the &s;tars, and to
con&s;ider the great phaenomena of nature, he
could never imagine, that this grain of &s;and,
which we inhabit, occupied more the attention
of its Creator than the univer&s;e, which contains,
in the va&s;t regions of &s;pace, millions of other
&s;uns and other worlds. He alledges, that Mo&s;es
has not given us the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t creation
of this globe, but only a detail of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances
which attended its receiving a form fit
for the habitation of men, when the Almighty
transformed it from the &s;tate of a comet to that
of a planet. Comets, owing to the excentricity
of their orbits, are &s;ubject to dreadful vici&s;&s;i|tudes:
Sometimes, like that of 1680, they are
a thou&s;and times hotter than melted iron, and
&s;ometimes a thou&s;and times more cold than ice:
They cannot, therefore, furni&s;h habitation to
any creatures of which we can form a concep|tion;
or rather, they are altogether uninhabi|table.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="126">
The planets, on the contrary, are tranquil bo|dies;
their di&s;tances from the &s;un vary but
little; and their temperature continues &s;o nearly
the &s;ame, that it permits plants and animals to
grow and to multiply.</P>
<P>In the beginning, &s;ays Mr Whi&s;ton, God
created the univer&s;e; but the earth was then an
uninhabitable comet, and &s;ubject to &s;uch alter|nate
extremes of cold and heat, that its matter,
being &s;ometimes liquified and &s;ometimes frozen,
was in the form of a chaos, or an aby&s;s, &s;ur|rounded
with utter darkne&s;s: <HI>And darkne&s;s co|vered
the face of the deep.</HI> This chaos was the
atmo&s;phere of the comet, a body compo&s;ed of
heterogeneous materials, having its centre oc|cupied
with a globular, &s;olid, hot nucleus of
about 2000 leagues in diameter, round which
was an exten&s;ive ma&s;s of a thick fluid, mixed
with heterogeneous and undige&s;ted materials,
like the chaos of the antients, <HI>rudis et indige&s;|taque
moles.</HI> This great atmo&s;phere contained
few dry, &s;olid, or earthy particles, and &s;till le&s;s
of water or air; but it was amply filled with
thick and heavy fluids, mixed, agitated, and
jumbled together in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Such
was the condition of the earth when &s;ix days
old: But, next day, that is, on the fir&s;t day of
the creation, when the excentric orbit of the
comet was changed into an ellip&s;e, nearly cir|cular,
every thing a&s;&s;umed its proper place; the
different materials arranged them&s;elves accor|ding
<PB N="102" REF="127">
to their &s;pecific gravities; the heavy fluids
&s;unk down, and left to the earthy, watery, and
aerial &s;ub&s;tances, the &s;uperior regions. The&s;e
al&s;o de&s;cended in the order of their gravities;
fir&s;t the earth, then the water, and, la&s;tly, the
air. In this manner, the immen&s;e volume of
chaos was reduced to a moderate &s;phere, the
center of which is a &s;olid body that &s;till retains
the heat it received from the &s;un, when former|ly
the nucleus of a comet. This heat may ea&s;ily
la&s;t 6000 years, &s;ince the comet 1680 would re|quire
50,000 before it cooled. Round the &s;o|lid
and burning nucleus, at the center of the
earth, is placed the heavy fluid which de&s;cended
fir&s;t, and formed the great aby&s;s, upon which
the earth floats like a cork on quick-&s;ilver. But,
as the earthy parts were originally mixed with a
great body of water, they, in de&s;cending, drove
before them a part of this water, which was
con&s;ined there when the earth con&s;olidated, and
formed a &s;tratum concentric with the heavy
fluid that &s;urrounds the nucleus. Thus, the
great aby&s;s is compo&s;ed of two concentric circles,
the interior being a heavy fluid, and the &s;upe|rior
water, upon which la&s;t the earth is imme|diately
founded. From this admirable arrange|ment,
produced by the atmo&s;phere of a comet,
are to be deduced the theory of the earth, and
an explication of all its phaenomena.</P>
<P>After the atmo&s;phere of the comet had been
freed from the &s;olid and earthy particles, a pure
<PB N="103" REF="128">
air only remained, through which the rays of
the &s;un in&s;tantly penetrated, and produced light:
<HI>Let there be light</HI>; <HI>and there was light.</HI> The
va&s;t columns or beds of which the earth is com|po&s;ed,
being formed with &s;o much precipitation,
is the rea&s;on why they differ &s;o much in den&s;ity;
the heavier &s;unk deeper into the aby&s;s than the
lighter, and, of cour&s;e, gave ri&s;e to mountains
and valleys: The&s;e inequalities, before the de|luge,
were differently &s;ituated from what they
are at pre&s;ent. In&s;tead of that va&s;t valley which
contains the ocean, many &s;mall caverns were
di&s;per&s;ed over the globe, each of which contain|ed
a part of the waters. The mountains were
then at greater di&s;tances, and formed not large
chains. But the earth was a thou&s;and times
more fertile, and contained a thou&s;and times
more inhabitants; and the life of man, and of
the other animals, was ten times longer, All
the&s;e effects were produced by the &s;uperior heat
of the central fire, which gave birth to a great|er
number of plants and animals, and, at the
&s;ame time, be&s;towed on them a degree of vigour
that enabled them to exi&s;t long, and to multi|ply
abundantly. But this heat had a mi&s;erable
effect upon the di&s;po&s;itions of men and other
animals: It augmented the pa&s;&s;ions, robbed man
of his innocence, and dimini&s;hed the &s;agacity of
the brute creation. All creatures, excepting the
fi&s;hes, who inhabited a colder element, felt the
influence of the central heat, became vicious,
<PB N="104" REF="129">
and merited death. This univer&s;al death was
accordingly inflicted, on Wedne&s;day the 28th
day of November, by a dreadful deluge, which
la&s;ted 40 days and 40 nights, and was occa|&s;ined
by the tail of a comet meeting with the
earth, in returning from its perihelion.</P>
<P>The tail of a comet is the lighte&s;t part of its
atmo&s;phere. It is a tran&s;parent and &s;ubtile va|pour
rai&s;ed by the heat of the &s;un from the bo|dy
of the comet. This vapour, which is com|po&s;ed
of aerial and watery particles extremely
rarified, follows the comet in its de&s;cent to its
perihelion, and goes before the comet in its
a&s;cent, its &s;ituation being always oppo&s;ite to the
&s;un, as if it had an affection for the &s;hade, and
wi&s;hed to avoid the &s;corching rays of the &s;un.
This column of a vapour is often of an im|men&s;e
extent; and its length always increa&s;es
in proportion as the comet approaches nearer
the &s;un. Now, as many comets de&s;cend below
the annual orbit of the earth, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing
that the earth &s;hould &s;ometimes be involved in
this vapour. This dreadful event happened at
the time of the deluge. The tail of a comet, in
two hours, will di&s;charge a quantity of water
equal to that contained in the whole ocean. In
fine, this tail is what Mo&s;es calls the cataracts
of heaven: <HI>And the cataracts of heaven were
opened.</HI> The globe of the earth, when it meets
with a comet's tail, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in its pa&s;|&s;age
through this body of vapour, appropriate
<PB N="105" REF="130">
part of its materials. Every thing that comes
within the &s;phere of the earth's attraction mu&s;t
fall upon it, and mu&s;t fall in the form of va|pour,
&s;ince the tail it&s;elf principally con&s;i&s;ts of
that element. In this manner, rain may come
from the heavens in &s;uch abundance, as to pro|duce
an univer&s;al deluge, and to &s;urmount the
tops of the highe&s;t mountains.</P>
<P>Our author, however, unwilling to go beyond
the letter of the &s;acred writings, does not a&s;cribe
the deluge to this rain alone, which he has cho|&s;en
to bring from &s;o great a di&s;tance. He takes
advantage of water wherever he can find it:
The great aby&s;s, as we have &s;een, contains a
con&s;iderable quantity. The earth, in its ap|proach
towards the comet, would feel the force
of its attraction; the waters in the great aby&s;s
would be &s;o agitated with a motion &s;imilar to
that of the tides, as would nece&s;&s;arily break the
&s;hell or cru&s;t in many places, and make the water
ru&s;h out upon the &s;urface: <HI>And the fountains
of the aby&s;s were opened.</HI></P>
<P>But how, it may be a&s;ked, was this va&s;t col|lection
of water, &s;o liberally furni&s;hed by the
great aby&s;s, and by the comet's tail, afterwards
di&s;po&s;ed of? Our author is not embarra&s;&s;ed by
this circum&s;tance. As &s;oon as the earth e&s;caped
from the comet, the flux and reflux of the great
aby&s;s nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;ed. From that moment,
the waters on the &s;urface ru&s;hed down with vio|lence
by the &s;ame channels out of which they
<PB N="106" REF="131">
had i&s;&s;ued. The great aby&s;s &s;wallowed up not
only its own water, but all that had been depo|&s;ited
by the comet, which it was &s;ufficiently e|nabled
to contain; becau&s;e, during its agitation,
and when it broke the cru&s;t, it had greatly en|larged
its dimen&s;ions, by pu&s;hing the earth far|ther
from it on all &s;ides. It was at this time
likewi&s;e, that the earth, which was formerly a
&s;phere, a&s;&s;umed its elliptical figure. This effect
was produced by the centrifugal force occa&s;ion|ed
by the diurnal motion of the earth, and by
the attraction of the comet; for the earth, when
pa&s;&s;ing through the tail of the comet, was &s;o &s;i|tuated,
that its equatorial parts were neare&s;t that
&s;tar; and, of cour&s;e, the power of the comet's
attraction, concurring with the earth's centrifu|gal
force, elevated the equatorial regions with
the greater facility, becau&s;e the cru&s;t was broken
in an infinite number of places, and becau&s;e the
flux and reflux of the aby&s;s pu&s;hed more vio|lently
again&s;t the equator than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>This is the hi&s;tory Mr Whi&s;ton gives of the
creation, of the cau&s;es of the univer&s;al deluge,
of the longevity of the Antedeluvians, and of
the figure of the earth. All the&s;e difficult &s;ub|jects
&s;eem to have given our author very little
trouble. But he appears to be greatly puzzled
about Noah's ark. In that dreadful confu&s;ion
produced by the conjunction of the tail of a
comet, and by the waters of the great aby&s;s,
and in that horrible period, when not only
<PB N="107" REF="132">
the elements of this globe were confounded,
but when the heavens concurred with the
bowels of the earth in producing new ele|ments
to increa&s;e the chaos, how is it to be ima|gined
that the ark could float tranquilly, with
its numerous and valuable cargo, upon the &s;ur|face
of the waves? Here our author &s;truggles
hard, in order to account for the pre&s;ervation of
the ark. But, as his rea&s;oning, upon this &s;ub|ject,
appears to be inconclu&s;ive, ill-imagined,
and heterodox, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve how hard
it is for a man, who had explained objects &s;o
great and &s;urpri&s;ing, without having recour&s;e to
a &s;upernatural power, to be &s;topped in his career
by a trifling circum&s;tance. But he chu&s;es to
ri&s;k drowning him&s;elf along with the ark,
rather than to a&s;cribe the pre&s;ervation of this
precious ve&s;&s;el to the interpo&s;ition of the Al|mighty!</P>
<P>I &s;hall only make a &s;ingle remark upon this
&s;y&s;tem, of which I have given a faithful abridge|ment.
Whenever men are &s;o pre&s;umptuous as
to attempt a phy&s;ical explanation of theological
truths; whenever they allow them&s;elves to in|terpret
the &s;acred text by views purely human;
whenever they rea&s;on concerning the will of the
Deity, and the execution of his decrees; they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily involve them&s;elves in ob&s;curity,
and tumble into a chaos of confu&s;ion, like the
author of this whim&s;ical &s;y&s;tem, which, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="108" REF="133">
all its ab&s;urdities, has been received
with great applau&s;e. Mr Whi&s;ton neither doubt|ed
of the truth of the deluge, nor of the au|thenticity
of the &s;acred writings. But, as phy|&s;ics
and a&s;tronomy occupied his principal at|tention,
he mi&s;took pa&s;&s;ages of holy writ for
phy&s;ical facts, and for re&s;ults of a&s;tronomical
ob&s;ervation; and &s;o &s;trangely jumbled divinity
with human &s;cience, that he has given birth to
the mo&s;t extraordinary &s;y&s;tem that perhaps ever
did or ever will appear.</P>

<P>MR Burnet is the fir&s;t author who di&s;co|vered
enlarged views of the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject,
and who treated it in a &s;y&s;tematic manner.
He was a man of genius and of ta&s;te: His work
acquired great reputation, and was, of cour&s;e,
critici&s;ed by many of the learned, and, among
others, by Mr Keill, who, &s;crutinizing the &s;ub|ject
as a geometer, demon&s;trated the errors of
Burnet's theory in a treati&s;e entitled, <HI>An exami|nation
of the Theory of the earth.</HI> Mr Keill
likewi&s;e refuted the &s;y&s;tem of Whi&s;ton; but he
treated the latter in a manner very different
from the former. He even appears, in many
particulars, to adopt the opinions of Whi&s;ton;
and con&s;iders the notion, that the deluge was
<PB N="110" REF="135">
occa&s;ioned by the tail of a comet, as exceeding|ly
probable. But, to return to Burnet: His
book is equally written; he knows how to paint
the grande&s;t images and the mo&s;t magnificent
&s;cenes. His plan is elevated; but, being defec|tive
in proper materials, he often fails in the
execution. His rea&s;onings and his proofs are
feeble; but the boldne&s;s with which he writes
makes the reader lo&s;e &s;ight of all his imper|fections.</P>
<P>He begins with alledging, that the earth, be|fore
the deluge, was very different from what
it is now. It was at fir&s;t, &s;ays he, a fluid ma&s;s,
compo&s;ed of matters of every &s;pecies, and of all
kinds of figures, the heavie&s;t of which de&s;cend|ed
to the centre, and there formed a hard and
&s;olid body. The waters took their &s;tation round
this body; and all lighter fluids ro&s;e above the
water. Thus, between the coat of air, and that
of water, was interpo&s;ed a coat of oily matter.
But, as the air was then full of impurities, and
contained great quantities of earthy particles,
the&s;e gradually &s;ub&s;ided upon the coat or &s;tra|tum
of oil, and formed a cru&s;t compo&s;ed of
earth and oil: This cru&s;t was the fir&s;t habitable
part of the earth, and the fir&s;t abode of man
and other animals. This land was light, fat,
and adapted to fo&s;ter the tenderne&s;s of the ori|ginal
germs. The &s;urface of the earth was level
and uniform, without mountains, &s;eas, or other
inequalities. But it remained in this &s;tare about
<PB N="111" REF="136">
&s;ixteen centuries only; for the heat of the &s;un
gradually drying the cru&s;t, produced, at fir&s;t,
only &s;uperficial fi&s;&s;ures or cracks; but, in pro|ce&s;s
of time, the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures penetrated deeper, and
increa&s;ed &s;o much in their dimen&s;ions, that, at
la&s;t, they entirely perforated the cru&s;t. In an
in&s;tant, the whole earth &s;pilt in pieces, and fell
into the great aby&s;s of waters which it formerly
&s;urrounded. This great event was the univer|&s;al
deluge.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of earth, in falling into
the aby&s;s, carried along with them va&s;t quanti|ties
of air, and they da&s;hed again&s;t each other,
and accumulated and divided &s;o irregularly, that
great cavities filled with air were left between
them. The waters gradually opened pa&s;&s;ages
into the&s;e cavities, and, in proportion as the ca|vities
were filled with the water, the &s;urface of
the earth began to di&s;cover it&s;elf in the mo&s;t e|levated
places; and, at la&s;t, the waters appeared
no where but in tho&s;e exten&s;ive valleys which
contain the ocean. Thus our ocean is a part of
the antient aby&s;s; the re&s;t of it remains in the
internal cavities, with which the &s;ea has &s;till a
communication. I&s;lands and &s;ea-rocks are the
&s;mall fragments, and continents are the large
ma&s;&s;es of the antient cru&s;t. As both the rupture
and fall of this cru&s;t were effected in a &s;udden
and confu&s;ed manner, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that
the &s;urface of the pre&s;ent earth &s;hould be full
<PB N="112" REF="137">
of mountains, gulfs, plains, and irregularities
of every kind.</P>
<P>This &s;pecimen is &s;ufficient to give an idea of
Burnet's &s;y&s;tem. It is an elegant romance, a
book which may be read for amu&s;ement, but
which cannot convey any in&s;truction. The au|thor
was ignorant of the chief phaenomena of
the earth, and a man of no ob&s;ervation. He
has drawn every thing from imagination, which
often acts again&s;t both truth and rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Sy&s;tem of Woodward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An E&s;&s;ay towards the Natural Hi&s;tory of the Earth, by John Woodward.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>OF this author, it may be &s;aid, that he want|ed
to build an immen&s;e edifice upon a
foundation le&s;s firm than &s;and, and to con&s;truct
a world with du&s;t; for he a&s;&s;erts, that the earth,
at the time of the deluge, &s;uffered a total di&s;&s;o|lution.
In peru&s;ing his book, the fir&s;t idea that
pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, that this di&s;&s;olution was effected
by the waters of the great aby&s;s. He alledges,
that, at the command of God, the aby&s;s &s;udden|ly
opened, and diffu&s;ed &s;uch an enormous quan|tity
of water on the &s;urface, as was &s;ufficient
to cover the tops of the highe&s;t mountains; and
<PB N="114" REF="139">
that God &s;u&s;pended the law of cohe&s;ion, which
in&s;tantly reduced every &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance into a
powder, &amp;c. He did not con&s;ider, that, by
the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, he added to the miracle of
the univer&s;al deluge many other miracles, or,
at lea&s;t, phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibilities, which accord
neither with the &s;criptures, nor with the prin|ciples
of mathematics and of natural philo&s;ophy.
But, as this author has the merit of collecting
many important ob&s;ervations, and, as he knew
better than any former writer the materials of
which the globe is compo&s;ed, his &s;y&s;tem, though
ill conceived, and wor&s;e arranged, by the lu&s;tre
of a few &s;triking facts, has &s;educed many weak
men into a belief of his general conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now give a &s;hort view of his theo|ry,
by which we will be enabled to do ju&s;tice to
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the author, and put the reader in
a condition of judging of the futility of his &s;y&s;|tem,
and of the fal&s;hood of &s;ome of his remarks.
Mr Woodward informs us, that he recogni&s;ed
with his own eyes all the materials of which
the earth in England is compo&s;ed, from the &s;ur|face
to the greate&s;t depths that had been dug;
that they were all di&s;po&s;ed in beds, or &s;trata;
and that, in many of the&s;e beds, there are &s;hells
and other productions of the &s;ea. He then
adds, that he was a&s;&s;ured by his friends and cor|re&s;pondents,
that, in all the other countries of the
world, the earth was compo&s;ed of the &s;ame ma|terials;
and that &s;hells are found, not only in the
<PB N="115" REF="140">
plains, and in &s;ome particular parts, but on the
highe&s;t mountains, in the deepe&s;t pits, and in an
infinite number of different places. He ob&s;erved,
that the beds were all horizontal, and placed
over each other, like matters tran&s;ported by the
waters, and depo&s;ited in the form of &s;ediment.
The&s;e general remarks, which are founded in
truth, are followed with &s;ome particular ob&s;er|vations,
by which he demon&s;trates, that the fo&s;|&s;il
&s;hells incorporated with the &s;trata are real
&s;ea-&s;hells, and not peculiar minerals, <HI>lu&s;us natu|rae,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations, though partly made
before him, he has added others of a more &s;u&s;|picious
nature. He a&s;&s;erts, that the materials of
the different &s;trata are arranged according to
their &s;pecific gravities. This a&s;&s;ertion is not
con&s;i&s;tent with truth. We every day &s;ee &s;olid
rocks placed above clay, &s;and, pit-coal, bitumen,
which have unque&s;tionably a greater &s;pecific gra|vity
than the latter materials. If, indeed, it
were uniformly found, through the whole earth,
that the upper &s;tratum was bitumen, followed
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively by &s;trata of chalk, marle, clay, &s;and,
&s;tone, marble, and metals, it would, in that ca&s;e,
be probable that all tho&s;e materials had been
precipitated at once: And this our author affirms
with confidence, though the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob|&s;erver
needs only his eyes to convince him, that
heavy &s;trata are often found above light ones;
and, con&s;equently, that the&s;e &s;ediments could
not be depo&s;ited at the &s;ame time, but mu&s;t have
<PB N="116" REF="141">
been tran&s;ported and dropped by the ocean at
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods. As this is the foundation
of Woodward's &s;y&s;tem, and is manife&s;tly fal&s;e,
we &s;hall follow him no farther than to &s;how
how an erroneous principle produces fal&s;e rela|tions,
and bad conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the &s;trata that compo&s;e the earth, &s;ays our
author, from the tops of the highe&s;t mountains
to the deepe&s;t mines, are placed according to
their re&s;pective &s;pecific gravities. Hence, he con|cludes,
the whole mu&s;t have been in a &s;tate
of di&s;&s;olution, and precipitated at the &s;ame
time. But at what time, in what men&s;truum,
was it di&s;&s;olved? In the water, &s;ays Mr Wood|ward,
and at the time of the deluge. But there
is not water enough on the globe to produce
this effect; for there is more land than water,
and the bottom of the &s;ea it&s;elf is earth. Very
well, he replies; but there is enough of water in
the central parts of the earth; and nothing more
was wanting than to be&s;tow on it the power
of di&s;&s;olving every terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tance, except|ing
&s;ea-&s;hells; to find a proper method of ma|king
the waters return to the aby&s;s; and to
make all this corre&s;pond with the hi&s;tory of the
deluge. Behold a &s;y&s;tem, of which the author
could not prevail on him&s;elf to form a doubt;
for, when it was objected to him, that water
could not di&s;&s;olve marble, rocks, and metals, e|&s;pecially
in 40 days, the time of the waters re|maining
on the earth; he replied &s;imply, that
the event, however, did happen. When it was
<PB N="117" REF="142">
demanded of him, how the waters of the aby&s;s
could di&s;&s;olve the whole earth, and yet pre&s;erve
the &s;hells? He an&s;wered, that he never proved
that this water was a di&s;&s;olvent; but that, from
facts, it was clear that the earth had been di&s;|&s;olved,
and that the &s;hells were pre&s;erved. La&s;t|ly,
When it was demon&s;trated to him, that his
&s;y&s;tem was u&s;ele&s;s, as it was neither &s;upported
by rea&s;on nor by facts; he &s;aid, we had only to
&s;uppo&s;e, that, at the time of the deluge, the laws
of gravity and of cohe&s;ion were &s;uddenly &s;top|ped,
and, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, the di&s;&s;olution
of the antient world admitted of an ea&s;y expla|nation.
But, it was ob&s;erved to him, if the force
of cohe&s;ion was &s;u&s;pended, Why were not the
&s;hells di&s;&s;olved along with the re&s;t? Here he
gave a harangue on the organization of &s;hells
and of animal bones, tending to prove that their
texture was fibrous, and different from that of
minerals; that their cohe&s;ion was likewi&s;e dif|ferent;
and that, after all, we have only to &s;up|po&s;e
that the powers of gravity and of cohe&s;ion
did not entirely cea&s;e, but that they were dimi|ni&s;hed
to &s;uch a degree, as enabled them to di&s;|&s;olve
the parts of minerals, but not tho&s;e of ani|mals.
I &s;hall conclude with remarking, that
our author's philo&s;ophy was not equal to his ge|nius
for ob&s;ervation; it is therefore unnece&s;&s;ary
to give a formal refutation of ab&s;urd notions, e|&s;pecially
when they proceed upon conjectures
that are contrary both to the laws of probability
and of mechanics.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Examination of &s;ome other Sy&s;tems.</HEAD>
<P>THE three hypothe&s;es ju&s;t mentioned have
many things in common: They all agree
in this point, that, at the time of the deluge,
both the external and internal form of the earth
was changed: But none of the&s;e theori&s;ts con|&s;idered,
that the earth, before the deluge, was
inhabited by the &s;ame &s;pecies of men and ani|mals;
and, con&s;equently, that it mu&s;t have been
nearly the &s;ame, both in figure and &s;tructure, as
it is at pre&s;ent. We are informed by the &s;acred
writings, that, before the deluge, there were ri|vers,
&s;eas, mountains, and fore&s;ts; that mo&s;t of
the&s;e mountains and rivers remained nearly in
their former &s;ituation; the Tigris and Euphrates,
<PB N="119" REF="144">
for example, ran through Paradi&s;e; that the Ar|menian
mountain on which the ark re&s;ted was,
at the deluge, one of the highe&s;t mountains of
the earth, as it is at this day; and that the &s;ame
plants and the &s;ame animals which inhabited
the earth before the deluge, continue &s;till to ex|i&s;t;
for we are told of the &s;erpent, of the crow,
and of the pigeon that carried the olive branch
into the ark. Tournefort indeed alledges, that
there are no olives within 400 leagues of Mount
Araret, and affects to be witty on this head. It
is, however, indi&s;putable, that there were olives
in the neighbourhood of this mountain at the
time of the deluge; for Mo&s;es a&s;&s;ures us of the
fact in the mo&s;t expre&s;s manner. Be&s;ides, it is
not &s;urpri&s;ing, that, in the cour&s;e of 4000 years,
the olives &s;hould be extirpated in the&s;e provin|ces,
and multiplied in others. It is, therefore,
contrary both to &s;cripture and rea&s;on, that the&s;e
authors have &s;uppo&s;ed the earth, before the de|luge,
to have been totally different from what it
is now; and this oppo&s;ition between their hy|pothe&s;es
and the &s;acred writings, as well as &s;ound
philo&s;ophy, is &s;ufficient to di&s;credit their &s;y&s;tems,
although they &s;hould corre&s;pond with &s;ome phae|nomena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage du Levant, vol. 2. p. 336.</NOTE>.
Burnet, who wrote fir&s;t, gives nei|ther
facts nor ob&s;ervations in &s;upport of his
&s;y&s;tem. Woodward's book is only a &s;hort e&s;|&s;ay,
in which he promi&s;es much more than he
was able to perform; it is only a project, with|out
any degree of execution. He makes u&s;e of
<PB N="120" REF="145">
two general remarks, 1. That the earth is every
where compo&s;ed of materials which had for|merly
been in a &s;tate of fluidity, and which had
been depo&s;ited by the waters in horizontal beds.
2. That, in the bowels of many parts of the
earth, there are an infinite number of &s;ea-bodies.
To account for the&s;e facts, he was recour&s;e to
the univer&s;al deluge; or rather, he appears to
employ the&s;e as proofs of the deluge. But, like
Burnet, he falls into evident contradictions; for
it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, with the&s;e authors, that,
before the deluge, there were no mountains,
&s;ince we are expre&s;sly told, that the waters ro&s;e
15 cubits above the tops of the highe&s;t moun|tains.
On the other hand, it is not &s;aid, that
the waters de&s;troyed or di&s;&s;olved the mountains.
In place of this extraordinary di&s;&s;olution, the
mountains remained firm in their original &s;i|tuations,
and the ark re&s;ted upon the one which
was fir&s;t de&s;erted by the waters. Be&s;ides, it is
impo&s;&s;ible to imagine, that, during the &s;hort
time the deluge continued, the waters could di&s;|&s;olve
the mountains, and the whole fabric of the
earth. Is it not ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in the
&s;pace of forty days, the harde&s;t rocks and mine|rals
were di&s;&s;olved by &s;imple water? Is it not
a manife&s;t contradiction to admit this total di&s;|&s;olution,
and yet to maintain that &s;hells, bones,
and other productions of the &s;ea, were able to
re&s;i&s;t a men&s;truum, to which the mo&s;t &s;olid ma|terials
had yielded? Upon the whole, I cannot
<PB N="121" REF="146">
he&s;itate in pronouncing, that Woodward, though
furni&s;hed with excellent facts and ob&s;ervations,
has produced but a weak and incon&s;i&s;tent theo|ry.</P>
<P>Whi&s;ton, who wrote la&s;t, has greatly im|proved
upon the other two; and, though he
has given loo&s;e reins to his imagination, it can|not
be &s;aid that he falls into contradiction. He
advances many things that are incredible; but
they are neither ab&s;olutely nor apparently im|po&s;&s;ible.
As we are ignorant of what materials
the centre of the earth is compo&s;ed, he thinks
him&s;elf entitled to &s;uppo&s;e it a &s;olid nucleus,
&s;urrounded with a ring of heavy fluid matter,
and then follows a ring of water, upon which
the external cru&s;t is &s;upported. In this ring of
water, the different parts of the cru&s;t &s;unk more
or le&s;s in proportion to their gravities, and gave
ri&s;e to mountains and inequalities on the &s;urface
of the earth. But our a&s;tronomer here commits
a blunder in mechanics. He con&s;idered not,
that the earth, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, mu&s;t have
formed one uniform arch; and, con&s;equently,
that it could not be &s;upported by the water, and
far le&s;s could any part of this arch &s;ink deeper
than another. If this be excepted, I doubt whe|ther
he has fallen into any other phy&s;ical blunder:
He has, however, committed many errors both
in metaphy&s;ics and theology. In fine, it cannot
be denied ab&s;olutely, that the earth, in meeting
with the tail of a comet, would be deluged, e|&s;pecially
<PB N="122" REF="147">
if it be allowed to the author, that the
tails of comets contain watery vapours. Neither
is it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that the tail of a co|met,
in returning from its perihelion, &s;hould
burn the earth, if we &s;uppo&s;e, with Mr Whi&s;ton,
that the comet pa&s;&s;ed very near the &s;un's body.
The &s;ame ob&s;ervations may be made upon the
re&s;t of his &s;y&s;tem. But, though his notions be
not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, when taken &s;eparate|ly,
they are &s;o exceedingly improbable, that the
whole a&s;&s;emblage may be regarded as exceeding
the bounds of human credulity.</P>
<P>The&s;e three are not the only books that have
been written upon the theory of the earth. In
1729, M. Bourguet publi&s;hed, along with his
<HI>Philo&s;ophical Letters on the formation of Salts, &amp;c.</HI>
a memoir, in which he gives a &s;pecimen of a
&s;y&s;tem which he had projected; but the execu|tion
of it was prevented by the death of the au|thor.
It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that no man
was more indu&s;trious and acute in making ob|&s;ervations,
and in collecting facts. To him we
are indebted for remarking the corre&s;pondence
between the angles of mountains, which is the
chief key to the theory of the earth. He ar|ranges
the materials he had collected in the be&s;t
order. But, with all the&s;e advantages, it is pro|bable,
that he would not have &s;ucceeded in gi|ving
a phy&s;ical hi&s;tory of the changes that have
happened in the earth; and he appears not to
have di&s;covered the cau&s;es of tho&s;e effects which
<PB N="123" REF="148">
he relates. To be convinced of this, we have
only to take a view of the propo&s;itions he de|duces
from tho&s;e phaenomena which behoved
to be the foundation of his theory. He &s;ays,
that the earth was formed at once, and not &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively;
that its figure and di&s;po&s;ition demon|&s;trate
that it was formerly in a fluid &s;tate; that
the pre&s;ent condition of the earth is very differ|ent
from what it was &s;ome ages after its fir&s;t
formation; that the matter of the globe was
originally more &s;oft than after its &s;urface was
changed; that the conden&s;ation of its &s;olid parts
dimini&s;hed gradually with its velocity; &s;o that,
after a certain number of revolutions round its
own axis, and round the &s;un, its original &s;truc|ture
was &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved; that this happened
at the vernal equinox; that the &s;ea-&s;hells in&s;i|nuated
them&s;elves into the di&s;&s;olved matters;
that the earth, after this di&s;&s;olution, a&s;&s;umed its
pre&s;ent form; and that, as &s;oon as the fire or
heat operated upon it, its con&s;umption gradually
began, and, at &s;ome future period, it will be
blown up with a dreadful explo&s;ion, accompa|nied
with a general conflagration, which will
augment the atmo&s;phere, and dimini&s;h the dia|meter
of the globe; and then the earth, in place
of &s;trata of &s;and or clay, will con&s;i&s;t only of
beds of calcined materials, and mountains com|po&s;ed
of amalgams of different metals.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ufficient view of the &s;y&s;tem which
M. Bourguet de&s;igned to compo&s;e. To gue&s;s at
<PB N="124" REF="149">
the pa&s;t, and to predict the future, nearly in the
&s;ame manner as others have gue&s;&s;ed and predic|ted,
requires but a &s;mall effort of genius. This
author had more erudition than &s;ound and ge|neral
ideas. He appears not to have had the
capacity of forming enlarged views, or of com|prehending
the chain of cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P>In the Leip&s;ic Tran&s;actions, the celebrated
Leibnitz publi&s;hed a &s;ketch of an oppo&s;ite &s;y|&s;tem,
under the title of Protogaea. The earth,
according to Bourguet and others, was to be
con&s;umed by fire. But Leibnitz maintains, that
it originated from fire, and that it has under|gone
innumerable changes and revolutions. At
the time that Mo&s;es tells us the light was divi|ded
from the darkne&s;s, the greate&s;t part of the
earth was in flames. The planets, as well as the
earth, were originally fixed and luminous &s;tars.
After burning for many ages, he alledges, that
they were extingui&s;hed from a deficiency of
combu&s;tible matter, and that they became o|paque
bodies. The fire, by melting the matter,
produced a vitrified cru&s;t; and the ba&s;is of all
terre&s;trial bodies is gla&s;s, of which &s;and and gra|vel
are only the fragments. The other &s;pecies
of earth re&s;ulted from a mixture of &s;and with
water and fixed &s;alts; and, when the cru&s;t had
cooled, the moi&s;t particles, which had been ele|vated
in the form of vapour, fell down, and
formed the ocean. The&s;e waters at fir&s;t cover|ed
the whole &s;urface, and even overtopped the
<PB N="125" REF="150">
highe&s;t mountains. In the e&s;timation of this
author, the &s;hells, and other &s;poils of the ocean,
which every where abound, are indelible proofs
that the earth was formerly covered with the
&s;ea; and the great quantity of fixed &s;alts, of
&s;and, and of other melted and calcined matters
&s;hut up in the bowels of the earth, demon&s;trate,
that the conflagration had been general, and that
it had preceded the exi&s;tence of the ocean.
The&s;e ideas, though de&s;titute of evidence, are
elevated, and bear con&s;picuous marks of inge|nuity.
The thoughts have a connection, the hy|pothe&s;es
are not impo&s;&s;ible, and the con&s;equen|ces
that might be drawn from them are not con|tradictory.
But the great defect of this theory
is, that it applies not to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the
earth. It only explains what pa&s;&s;ed in ages &s;o
remote, that few ve&s;tiges remain; a man may,
therefore, affirm what he plea&s;es, and what he
&s;ays will be accompanied with more or le&s;s pro|bability,
in proportion to the extent of his ta|lents.
To maintain, with Whi&s;ton, that the
earth was originally a comet, or with Leibnitz,
that it was a fun, is to a&s;&s;ert what is equally
po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible; it would, therefore, be
ridiculous to inve&s;tigate either by the laws of
probability. The in&s;tantaneou&s;ne&s;s of the cre|ation
de&s;troys the notion of the globe's being
covered with the ocean, and of that being the
rea&s;on why &s;ea-&s;hells are &s;o much diffu&s;ed
through different parts of the earth; for, if that
<PB N="126" REF="151">
had been the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be allow|ed,
that &s;hells, and other productions of the o|cean,
which are &s;till found in the bowels of the
earth, were created long prior to man, and other
land-animals. Now, independent of &s;cripture-authority,
is it not rea&s;onable to think that the
origin of all kinds of animals and vegetables is
equally antient?</P>
<P>M. Scheutzer, in a di&s;&s;ertation addre&s;&s;ed to
the Academy of Sciences in 1708, attributes,
like Woodward, the change, or rather new cre|ation
of the globe, to the deluge. To account
for the formation of mountains, he tells us, that
God, when he ordered the waters to return to
their &s;ubterraneous abodes, broke, with his Al|mighty
hand, many of the horizontal &s;trata, and
elevated them above the &s;urface of the earth,
which was originally level. The whole di&s;&s;er|tation
was compo&s;ed with a view to &s;upport this
ridiculous opinion. As it was nece&s;&s;ary that
the&s;e eminences &s;hould be of a &s;olid con&s;i&s;tence,
Mr Scheutzer remarks, that God only rai&s;ed them
from places which abounded in &s;tones. Hence,
&s;ays he, tho&s;e countries, like Switzerland, which
are very &s;tony, are likewi&s;e mountainous; and
tho&s;e, like Flanders, Holland, Hungry, and Po|land,
which are mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of &s;and and
clay to great depths, have few or no moun|tains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hi&s;t. de l'Acad, 1708, p. 32.</NOTE>.</P>

This author, like Woodward, blends phy&s;ics

any of his predece&s;&s;ors. He has even de&s;cended

<P>Steno, and &s;ome others, have attributed the
origin of mountains, and other inequalities, up|on
the &s;urface of the earth, to particular inun|dations,
earthquakes, &amp;c. But the effects of
the&s;e &s;econdary cau&s;es could produce nothing
but &s;light changes. The&s;e cau&s;es may co-ope|rate
with the fir&s;t cau&s;e, namely, the tides, and
the motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Be|&s;ides,
Steno has given no theory, nor even any
general facts, upon this &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Di&s;&s;ert. de Solido intra Solidum nato, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ray alledges, that all mountains have been
produced by earthquakes, and has written a
treati&s;e to prove it. When we come to the ar|ticle
of volcano's, we &s;hall examine the foun|dation
of this opinion.</P>
<P>We cannot omit ob&s;erving here, that Burnet,
Whi&s;ton, Woodward, and mo&s;t other authors,
have fallen into an error which de&s;erves to be
rectified. They uniformly regard the deluge as
<PB N="128" REF="153">
an effect within the compa&s;s of natural cau&s;es,
although the &s;cripture repre&s;ents it as an imme|diate
operation of the Deity. It is beyond the
power of any natural cau&s;e to produce on the
&s;urface of the earth a quantity of water &s;ufficient
to cover the highe&s;t mountains: And, although
a cau&s;e could be imagined adequate to this effect,
it would &s;till be impo&s;&s;ible to find another cau&s;e
capable of making the waters di&s;appear. Grant|ing
that Whi&s;ton's waters proceeded from the
tail of a comet, we deny that any of them could
i&s;&s;ue from the aby&s;s, or that the whole could re|turn
into it; for the aby&s;s, according to him, was
&s;o environed, and pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by the ter|re&s;trial
cru&s;t, that it was impo&s;&s;ible the comet's at|traction
could produce the lea&s;t motion in the
fluids it contained, far le&s;s any motion re&s;em|bling
the tides: Hence, not a &s;ingle drop could
either proceed from, or enter into the great
aby&s;s. Unle&s;s, therefore, it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
the waters which fell from the comet were an|nihilated
by a miracle, they would for ever have
remained on the &s;urface, and covered the tops
of the highe&s;t mountains. The impo&s;&s;ibility of
explaining any effect by natural cau&s;es, is the
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential character of a miracle. Our au|thors
have made &s;everal vain efforts to account
for the deluge. Their errors in phy&s;ics, and in
the &s;econdary cau&s;es they employ, prove the
truth of the fact, as related in &s;cripture, and de|mon&s;trate,
that the univer&s;al deluge could not be
<PB N="129" REF="154">
accompli&s;hed by any other cau&s;e than the will
of the Deity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is apparent, that it was not at one
time, nor by the &s;udden effect of a deluge
that the &s;ea left uncovered tho&s;e continents
which we inhabit: It is certain, from the au|thority
of &s;cripture, that the terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e
was in A&s;ia, and that A&s;ia was inhabited before
the deluge; con&s;equently, the waters, at that
period, covered not this large portion of the
globe. The earth, before the deluge, was near|ly
the &s;ame as now. This enormous quantity of
water, poured out by Divine ju&s;tice upon guilty
men, de&s;troyed every living creature; but it
produced no change on the &s;urface of the earth;
it de&s;troyed not even the plants which grew up|on
it; for the pigeon returned to the ark with
an <HI>olive branch</HI> in her bill.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e, with many na|turali&s;ts,
that the waters of the deluge totally
changed the &s;urface of the globe, even to the
depth of two thou&s;and feet? Why imagine that
the deluge tran&s;ported tho&s;e &s;hells which are
found at the depth of &s;even or eight hundred feet,
immer&s;ed in rocks and in marble? Why refer to
this event the formation of hills and mountains?
And how is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that the wa|ters
of the deluge tran&s;ported banks of &s;hells of
100 leagues in length? I perceive not how they
can per&s;i&s;t in this opinion, unle&s;s they admit a
double miracle, one to create water, and ano|ther
<PB N="130" REF="155">
to tran&s;port &s;hells. But, as the fir&s;t only is
&s;upported by holy writ, I &s;ee no rea&s;on for ma|king
the &s;econd an article of faith.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the waters of the deluge
had retired &s;uddenly, they would have tran&s;port|ed
&s;uch immen&s;e quantities of mud and other
impurities, as would have rendered the land un|&s;it
for culture till many ages after the inunda|tion.
In the inundation which happened in
Greece, the country that was covered remained
barren for three centuries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vida acta erudit. Lip&s;. 1691, p. 100.</NOTE>. Thus the deluge
ought to be regarded as a &s;upernatural mode of
cha&s;tifing the wickedne&s;s of men, not as an ef|fect
proceeding from any natural cau&s;e. The
univer&s;al deluge was a miracle, both in its
cau&s;e and in its effects. It appears from the
&s;acred text, that the &s;ole de&s;ign of the deluge
was the de&s;truction of men and other ani|mals,
and that it changed not in any manner
the &s;urface of the earth; for, after the retreat
of the waters, the mountains, and even the trees,
kept their former &s;tations, and the land was &s;uit|ed
for the culture of vines and other fruits of
the earth. It might be a&s;ked, if the earth was
di&s;&s;olved in the waters, or, if the waters were &s;o
much agitated as to tran&s;port the &s;hells of India
into Europe, how the fi&s;hes, which entered not
into the ark, were per&s;erved?</P>
<P>The notion, that the &s;hells were tran&s;ported
and left upon the land by the deluge, is the ge|neral
<PB N="131" REF="156">
opinion, or rather &s;uper&s;tition, of natura|li&s;ts.
Woodward, Scheutzer, and others, call
petrified &s;hells the remains of the deluge; they
regard them as medals or monuments left us by
God of this dreadful cata&s;trophe, that the me|morial
of it might never be effaced among men.
La&s;tly, they have embraced this hypothe&s;is with
&s;o blind a veneration, that they are only anxious
to reconcile it with holy writ; and, in place of
deriving any light from ob&s;ervation and experi|ence,
they wrap them&s;elves up in the dark clouds
of phy&s;ical theology, the ob&s;curity and littlene&s;s
of which derogates from the &s;implicity and dig|nity
of religion, and pre&s;ents to the &s;ceptic no|thing
but a ridiculous medley of human conceits
and divine truths. To attempt an explanation
of the univer&s;al deluge and of its phy&s;ical cau&s;es;
to pretend to give a detail of what pa&s;&s;ed during
this great revolution; to conjecture what effects
have re&s;uited from it; to add facts to the &s;acred
writings, ad to draw con&s;equences from the&s;e
interpolated facts; is not this a pre&s;umptuous
de&s;ire of &s;canning the power of the Almighty?
The natural wonders wrought by his beneficent
hand, in a uniform and regular manner, are al|together
incomprehen&s;ible; his extraordinary
operations, or his miracles, ought, therefore, to
impre&s;s us with an awful a&s;toni&s;hment, and a
&s;ilent re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It may &s;till be urged, that as the univer&s;al de|luge
is an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, is it not lawful to rea|&s;on

upon its con&s;equences? True. But you mu&s;t
commence with acknowledging, that the deluge
could not po&s;&s;ibly be the effect of any phy&s;ical
cau&s;e, you mu&s;t regard it as an immediate ef|fect
of the divine will; you mu&s;t content your|&s;elf
with what is recorded in &s;cripture; and you
mu&s;t, above all, avoid bleding bad philo&s;ophy
with the purity of divine truth. After taking
the&s;e precautions, which a re&s;pect for the coun|&s;els
of the Almighty requires, what remains for
examination upon the &s;ubject of the deluge?
Does the &s;cared writings tell us that the moun|tains
were formed by the deluge? They tell us the
rever&s;e. Do they inform us, that the agitation
of the waters was &s;o great, as to rai&s;e the &s;hells
from the bottom of the ocean, and to di&s;per&s;e
them over the face of the earth? No: The ark
moved gently on the &s;urface of the waters. Do
they tell us, that the earth &s;uffered a total di&s;|&s;olution?
By no means. The narration of the
&s;acred hi&s;torian is &s;imple and true; that of na|turali&s;ts
is fabuious and complicated.</P>

<HEAD>Geography.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;urface of the earth, like that of Ju|piter,
is not divided into alternate bands
or belts, parallel to the Aequator. It, on the
contrary, is divided, from one pole to the other,
into two belts of earth, and two of &s;ea. The
fir&s;t and principal belt is the antient Continent,
the greate&s;t length of which is a line commen|cing
at the mo&s;t ea&s;tern point of the north of
Tartary, and extending from thence to the neigh|bourhood
of the gulf of Linchidolin, where the
Ru&s;&s;ians fi&s;h whales; from thence to Tobol&s;ki;
from Tobol&s;ki to the Ca&s;pin &s;ea; from the Ca&s;|pian
&s;ea to Mecca; from Mecca to the we&s;tern
part of the country inhabited by the Galli in


<PB N="134" REF="163">
Africa; from thence to Monoemuci, or Mono|motapa;
and, la&s;tly, to the Cape of Good Hope.
This line is about 3600 leagues in length, and
is never interrupted but by the Ca&s;pian and the
Red Sea, the breadth of which is incon&s;iderable,
and ought not to be regarded, e&s;pecially when,
like our &s;ea&s;ons, the whole &s;urface of the globe
is divided only into four parts.</P>
<P>This greate&s;t length of the Old Continent lies
in a diagonal line; for, if mea&s;ured by a meri|dian,
it will be found, that, from the northmo&s;t
point of Lapland to the Cape of Good Hope,
exceeds not 2500 leagues; and that this line,
though &s;horter, meets with greater interruptions
from the Baltic and Mediterranean. With re|gard
to all other lines that could be drawn un|der
the &s;ame meridians in the Old Continent,
they mu&s;t &s;till be le&s;s than tho&s;e we have men|tioned.
For example, from the mo&s;t &s;outhern
point of the I&s;land of Ceylon to the northern|mo&s;t
coa&s;t of Nova Zembla, is 1800 leagues. In
the &s;ame manner, if the continent be mea&s;ured
by lines parallel to the equator, its greate&s;t length,
without much interruption by &s;eas, will be found
to &s;tretch from Trefana, on the we&s;t coa&s;t of
Africa, to Ninpo, on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of China,
which is about 2800 leagues. Another line may
begin near Bre&s;t, and extend to the coa&s;t of Chine&s;e
Tartary, which will be nearly 2300 leagues.
From Bergen in Norway, to the coa&s;t of Kamt|&s;chatka,
is only 1800 leagues. All the&s;e lines

are much &s;horter than the fir&s;t. Thus the great|e&s;t
length of the Old Continent extends from
the ea&s;tern point of Tartary to the Cape of Good
Hope, and is about 3600 leagues. <HI>See plate I.
of Geogr.</HI></P>
<P>This line may be con&s;idered as the middle of
the antient Continent; for, in mea&s;uring the
&s;urface on each &s;ide of it, I find, that, on the
left, there are 2471092&frac34; &s;quare leagues; and,
on the right, there are 2469687, which is an
equality &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing as to render it extremely
probable that this line, which is the longe&s;t, at
the &s;ame time really divides the contents of the
antient Continent.</P>
<P>The Old Continent, then, con&s;i&s;ts of about
4940780 &s;quare leagues, which is a fifth part of
the &s;urface of the globe, and may be regarded
as a large belt of earth, with an inclination to
the equator of about 30 degrees.</P>
<P>The New Continent is another belt of earth,
the greate&s;t length of which may be taken from
the mouth of the river Plata to the lake of the
A&s;&s;iniboils. This line pa&s;&s;es from the mouth
of the river Plata to lake Caracara; from
thence to Mataguais, Pocona, Zongo, Ma|riana,
Morua, St Fe, and Carthagena; then it
pa&s;&s;es through the gulf of Mexico, and Jamaica,
and Cuba; from thence along the penin&s;ula of
Florida, through Apalache, Chicachas; and from
thence to St Louis, Fort le Sueur, and terminates
in the country bordering on lake A&s;&s;iniboils, the
<PB N="136" REF="166">
extent of which is unknown. <HI>See plate II. of
Geogr.</HI></P>
<P>This line is only interrupted by the Gulf of
Mexico, (which may be con&s;idered as a Medi|terranean
&s;ea), is about 2500 leagues in length,
and divides the New Continent nearly into two
equal parts, that on the left containing 1069286&frac56; leagues &s;quare, and that on the right 1070926 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">/12.
It is the middle of the belt of land called the
New Continent, and is likewi&s;e inclined to the
equator about 30 degrees, but in an oppo&s;ite
direction; for that of the Old Continent ex|tends
from the north-ea&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t; but
that of the New Continent from north-we&s;t to
&s;outh-ea&s;t. The &s;uperficial contents of the Old
and New Continents are about 7080993 &s;quare
leagues, which is not near a third part of the
&s;urface of the globe, which contains 25,000,000
&s;quare leagues.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e lines, which divide both the Conti|nents
into two equal parts, it may be remarked,
that they both terminate at the &s;ame degrees
of north and &s;outh latitude; and that the two
Continents make mutual advances, or projections,
exactly oppo&s;ite to each other, viz. tho&s;e on the
African coa&s;t, from the Canary i&s;les to Guiney;
and tho&s;e of America, from Guiana to the
mouth of the Rio-Janeiro.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that the mo&s;t antient
lands on the globe are tho&s;e which extend from
200 to 250 leagues on each &s;ide of the two lines
<PB REF="167">

<PB N="137" REF="168">
above de&s;cribed. Agreeable to this idea, which
is founded on the ob&s;ervations already made, we
find, that, in the Old Continent, the mo&s;t an|tient
countries of Africa are tho&s;e which &s;tretch
from the Cape of Good Hope to the Red Sea
and Aegypt, and are about 500 leagues broad;
and, con&s;equently, that the whole we&s;tern coa&s;t
of Africa, from Guiney to the Straits of Gibral|tar,
are new lands. In the &s;ame manner, if we
trace this line through A&s;ia, and include an e|qual
breadth, we &s;hall find, that the mo&s;t antient
countries are, the two Arabia's, Per&s;ia, Georgia,
Turcomania, a part of Independent Tartary,
Circa&s;&s;ia, part of Mu&s;covy, &amp;c.; and, of cour&s;e,
that Europe, and perhaps al&s;o China and the
ea&s;tern part of Tartary, are comparatively new
countries.</P>
<P>In the New Continent, we &s;hall likewi&s;e find,
that Terra Magellanica, the ea&s;tern part of Bra|&s;il,
of the country of the Amazons, of Guiana,
and of Canada, are new lands when compared
with Tucuman, Peru, Terra Firma, the i&s;lands
in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,
and Mexico. To the&s;e ob&s;ervations may be add|ed
two remarkable facts. The Old and New
Continents are nearly oppo&s;ite to each other.
The Old Continent extends farther north of the
equator than &s;outh; but the New, farther &s;outh
than north. The centre of the Old Continent
lies in the 16th or 18th degree of north latitude;
and the centre of the New Continent lies in the
<PB N="138" REF="169">
16th or 18th degree of &s;outh latitude, as if they
were intended to counterbalance each other.
There is another &s;ingular analogy between the
two continents, though it appears to be more the
effect of accident than tho&s;e ju&s;t mentioned.
Both continents might be divided into two por|tions,
which would be &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by
the &s;ea, excepting the two &s;mall i&s;thmus's of
Suez and Panama.</P>
<P>The&s;e general ob&s;ervations on the divi&s;ion of
the globe are the re&s;ult of an attentive &s;urvey.
We &s;hall not, upon this foundation, erect hy|pothe&s;es,
or indulge in rea&s;onings, which might
lead to fal&s;e conclu&s;ions. But, as the divi&s;ion
of the globe has never hitherto been con&s;idered
under this point of view, I &s;hall hazard a few
remarks. It is not a little &s;ingular, that the
longe&s;t line that can be drawn upon the two
continents &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, divide them
into two equal parts. It is not le&s;s remarkable,
that the&s;e two lines &s;hould commence and ter|minate
at the &s;ame degrees of latitude, and have
the &s;ame inclination to the equator. The&s;e re|lations
may lead to general conclu&s;ions, of which
we are &s;till ignorant. We &s;hall afterwards ex|amine,
in detail, the inequalities in the figure of
the two continents, and &s;hall only here remark,
that the mo&s;t antient countries &s;hould be found
in the neighbourhood of the above lines, and
&s;hould, at the &s;ame time, have the highe&s;t ele|vation;
and that the more recent lands &s;hould
<PB N="139" REF="170">
be mo&s;t remote from them, and likewi&s;e lie
lower. Agreeable to this idea, the newe&s;t coun|tries
in America would be the land of the Ama|zons,
Guiana, and Canada. In examining the
map of the&s;e countries, we perceive that they
are every where divided by numberle&s;s lakes
and rivers, which is a &s;till &s;tronger indication of
their recent origin. On the other hand, Tucu|man,
Peru, and Mexico, are high mountains,
and are &s;ituate near the line that divides the
continent; circum&s;tances which &s;eem to prove
the &s;uperior antiquity of the&s;e countries. Africa
is al&s;o extremely mountainous, and at the &s;ame
time very antient. In this part of the globe,
Aegypt, Barbary, and the we&s;tern coa&s;t, as far
as Senegal, can only be con&s;idered as new lands.
A&s;ia is perhaps the mo&s;t antient of all countries,
e&s;pecially Arabia, Per&s;ia, and Tartary. But the
inequalities of this great divi&s;ion of the globe,
as well as tho&s;e of Europe, &s;hall be treated in a
&s;eparate article. We &s;hall only remark, in ge|neral,
that Europe is a new country, as appears
from tho&s;e univer&s;al traditions concerning mi|grations
of different nations, and the origin of
arts and &s;ciences. It is not long &s;ince Europe
was full of mar&s;hes and fore&s;ts. But, in coun|tries
antiently inhabited, there are few woods,
lakes, or mar&s;hes, a great deal of heath and
&s;hrubs, and many high mountains, with dry and
barren tops; for men de&s;troy woods, drain
mar&s;hes and lakes, and, in proce&s;s of time, give
<PB N="140" REF="171">
an appearance to the face of the earth totally
different from that of uninhabited or newly
peopled countries.</P>
<P>A &s;mall portion of the globe only was known
to the antients. The whole of America, the
Artic circle, Terra Au&s;tralis and Magellanica,
and a great part of the interior regions of Afri|ca,
were unknown to them. They knew not
that the Torrid Zone was inhabited, although
they had &s;ailed round Africa. About 2200
years ago, Neco King of Aegypt furni&s;hed &s;ome
ve&s;&s;els to the Phoenicians, who &s;ailed down the
Red Sea, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and
the third year after their departure they entered
the Mediterranean by the Straits of Gibraltar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Herodotus, lib. 4.</NOTE>.
The antients, notwith&s;tanding, were totally ig|norant
of the polarity of the load&s;tone, although
they knew its power of attracting iron; they
knew not the cau&s;e of the tides; and they were
uncertain whether the ocean &s;urrounded the
globe. Some of them, indeed, &s;u&s;pected that it
might be &s;o; but the&s;e conjectures were &s;o ill
founded, that none of them ever dreamed of its
being po&s;&s;ible to circumnavigate the earth. Ma|gellan,
in the year 1519, was the fir&s;t who at|tempted
this great voyage; and he accompli&s;h|ed
it in 1124 days. Francis Drake, in the 1577,
was the &s;econd; and he performed it in 1056
days. Thomas Cavendi&s;h &s;et out upon this
voyage in 1586, and fini&s;hed it in 777 days.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="172">
The&s;e celebrated navigators were the fir&s;t
who gave a phy&s;ical demon&s;tration of the &s;phe|ricity
and extent of the circumference of the
earth. The antients, though they travelled
much, had no adequate idea of the extent of the
globe. They were equally ignorant of the
trade-winds, which are &s;o u&s;eful in long voy|ages.
Their limited knowledge in geography,
therefore, ought not to &s;urpri&s;e us, e&s;pecially when
it is con&s;idered, that, notwith&s;tanding the many
advantages derived from the mathematical
&s;ciences, and from the di&s;coveries of navigators,
many points remain &s;till undetermined, and va&s;t
regions are yet undi&s;covered. Of the countries
in the neighbourhood of the &s;outh pole, we on|ly
know that they exi&s;t, and that they are &s;epa|rated
from the other continents by the ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Cooke, in his late voyage, has demon&s;trated, in the compleate&s;t manner, that no continent exi&s;ts near the &s;outh pole.</NOTE>.
Much, likewi&s;e, remains to be di&s;covered con|cerning
the lands near the north pole: And, it
is a &s;ubject of regret, that, for a century pa&s;t,
the ardour for di&s;covering new countries has
greatly abated. The nations of Europe &s;eem,
and perhaps they are right, more di&s;po&s;ed to in|crea&s;e
the value of tho&s;e countries they have al|ready
di&s;covered, than to conquer new ones.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery, however, of the &s;outhern con|tinent,
would be a grand object of curio&s;ity,
and might be attended with the greate&s;t advan|tages.
A few of its coa&s;ts have been recogni|&s;ed;
but tho&s;e navigators who have attempted
<PB N="142" REF="173">
the di&s;covery, have been always prevented from
reaching land by large bodies of ice. The thick
fogs which infe&s;t tho&s;e &s;eas is another ob&s;tacle.
But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e inconveniencies,
it is probable, that, by &s;etting out from the Cape
of Good Hope at different &s;ea&s;ons, part of this
new world might &s;till be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>But another method might, perhaps, be atten|ded
with more &s;ucce&s;s. To avoid the fogs and
the ice, the di&s;covery might be attempted, by
departing from Baldivia, or &s;ome other port on
the coa&s;t of Chili, and traver&s;iong the &s;outh &s;ea
under the 50th degree of &s;outh latitude. This
navigation appears not to be hazardous; and it
is probable that it would be attended with the
di&s;covery of new lands; for the regions about
the &s;outh pole, &s;till unknown, are &s;o exten&s;ive,
that they may be computed to be about a fourth
part of the globe; and con&s;equently may con|tain
a country as large as the whole of Europe,
A&s;ia, and Africa.</P>
<P>While we remain ignorant of this part of the
earth, we cannot determine the proportion the
&s;urface of the land bears to that of the ocean;
from what we do know, it appears that there is
more &s;ea than land.</P>
<P>To acquire an idea of the va&s;t quantity of
water in the ocean, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a medium
depth, for example, that of 200 fathoms, or the
&s;ixth part of a league. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition,
there is as much water in the ocean as would be
<PB N="143" REF="174">
&s;ufficient to cover the whole globe to the depth
of 600 feet; or, if collected into one ma&s;s, it
would form a globe of 60 leagues in diameter.</P>
<P>It is alledged by navigatiors, that the latitudes
near the &s;outh pole are much colder than the
&s;ame latitudes towards the north. But this o|pinion
&s;eems to have no foundation. It &s;eems
to have been adopted from the circum&s;tance of
the ice appearing the latitudes where none is ever
found in the northern &s;eas. But this effect may
be owing to &s;ome peculiar cau&s;es. After the
month of April, there is no ice on this &s;ide of
67 or 68 degrees of north latitude; and the &s;a|vages
of Acadia and of Canada &s;ay, that, if the
ice be not melted in April, it indicates a cold and
rainy &s;ummer. The year 1725 was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
by an almo&s;t perpetual rain; and in April,
the ice in the northern &s;eas was not only not
melted at the 67th degree, but, on the 15th of
June, it was found in lat. 41 or 42<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'hi&s;t. de l'acad, anne&eacute; 1725.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great quantities of floating ice appear in the
north &s;eas, e&s;pecially at con&s;iderable di&s;tances
from land. They come from the Tartarean &s;ea
into that of Nova Zembla and other parts of the
Frozen ocean. I have been a&s;&s;ured by people
worthy of credit, that an Engli&s;h Captain, call|ed
Man&s;on, in&s;tead of &s;earching for a pa&s;&s;age
to China between the northern lands, directed
his cour&s;e &s;traight to the pole till he arrived
within two degrees of it; and that, in this cour&s;e,
<PB N="144" REF="175">
he found an open &s;ea, and no ice; which is a
clear proof that the ice is always formed near
the land, and never in an exten&s;ive &s;ea: For,
though it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, contrary to pro|bability,
that the cold was &s;o inten&s;e at the pole
as to freeze the &s;urface of the &s;ea, it is &s;till in|conceivable
how the&s;e enormous floating ma&s;&s;es
could be formed, without being attached to the
land, from which they are again &s;eparated by
the heat of the &s;un. Two ve&s;&s;els &s;ent by the
Ea&s;t India Company, in 1739, to di&s;cover land
in the &s;outh &s;eas, found boards of ice in lat. 47
or 48; but they were not very di&s;tant from the
&s;hore, which was in view, though the ve&s;&s;els
could not make their landing good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See on this &s;ubject a Chart by M. Buache, 1739.</NOTE>. The&s;e
boards of ice mu&s;t have been detached from the
lands in the neighbourhood of the &s;outh pole;
and it may be conjectured that they follow the
cour&s;e of &s;ome large rivers in the&s;e unknown
regions, in the &s;ame manner as the Oby, the Je|ni&s;ca,
and other great rivers which fall into the
north &s;eas, carry down boards of ice, which &s;hut
up, during the greate&s;t part of the year, the &s;traits
of Waigat, and render the &s;ea of Tartary, by
this cour&s;e, altogether inacce&s;&s;ible; while, be|yond
Nova Zembla, and nearer the pole, where
there is little land and few rivers, boards of ice
are le&s;s frequent, and the &s;ea is more navigable.
Hence, if any farther attempts be made to find
a pa&s;&s;age to China and Japan by the north &s;eas,
<PB N="145" REF="176">
it will, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary to keep at a di&s;tance
from the land and the ice, to &s;tear directly to|wards
the pole, and to explore the mo&s;t open
&s;eas, where unque&s;tionably there is little or no
ice: For it is well known, that &s;alt water can
take on a greater degree of cold, without freezing,
than fre&s;h water after it is congealed; con&s;e|quently,
the exce&s;&s;ive cold at the pole may ren|der
the &s;ea colder than ice, without freezing its
&s;urface. Be&s;ides, at 80 or 82 degrees, the &s;ea,
though mixed with &s;now and fre&s;h water, is ne|ver
frozen, excepting near the coa&s;ts. From
the united te&s;timony of &s;everal navigators, it is
apparent, that there is a pa&s;&s;age from Europe to
China by the north &s;ea: The rea&s;on why it
has &s;o often been in vain attempted is, that fear
prevented the undertakers from keeping at a
&s;ufficient di&s;tance from the land, and from ap|proaching
the pole, which they probably ima|gined
to be an immen&s;e rock.</P>
<P>William Barents, however, who, like many
others, had run aground in his voyage, never
doubted of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age, or
that, if he had kept farther from land, he would
have found an open &s;ea without ice. The Ru&s;|&s;ian
navigators &s;ent by the Czar to reconnoitre
the north &s;ea, relate, that Nova Zembla is not
an i&s;land, but a part of Tartary, and that, to the
north of it, there is a free and open &s;ea. A
Dutch voyager affirms, that whales are occa&s;io|nally
thrown upon the coa&s;ts of Corea and of
<PB N="146" REF="177">
Japan, with European harpoons &s;ticking in their
backs. Another Hollander alledges, that he had
penetrated to the pole it&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ures us, that
it was as warm as at Am&s;terdam in &s;ummer.
One Goulden, an Engli&s;hman, who had made
above thirty voyages to Greenland, related to
Charles II. that two Dutchmen, who &s;ailed along
with him, having been un&s;ucce&s;sful in fi&s;hing
off the coa&s;t of the I&s;le of Edges, re&s;olved to
proceed northward; that, upon their return,
fifteen days after, they told him, that they had
been at the 89th degree of latitude, where they
found no ice, but an open, deep &s;ea, like that in
the Bay of Bi&s;cay; and that they &s;howed him
the two &s;hips journals, in &s;upport of what they
advanced. In fine, it is related in the Philo&s;o|phical
Tran&s;actions, that two navigators, who
engaged in the di&s;covery of this pa&s;&s;age, pene|trated
300 leagues to the ea&s;t of Nova Zembla;
but that the Ea&s;t India Company, who thought
they had an intere&s;t in preventing the di&s;covery,
allowed them not to return<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Collect. of Voyages to the North, p. 200.</NOTE>. But the Dutch
Ea&s;t India Company, who believed them&s;elves
intere&s;ted in the di&s;covery, having made un&s;uc|ce&s;ful
attempts on the European &s;ide, tried to
find it by the way of Japan; and they would
probably have &s;ucceeded, if the Emperor of Ja|pan
had not prohibited all &s;trangers from navi|gating
on the coa&s;ts of the lands of Je&s;&s;o. This
pa&s;&s;age, therefore, cannot be found but by
<PB N="147" REF="178">
&s;teering directly to the pole beyond Spitzbergen,
or rather by keeping the open &s;ea between Nova
Zembla and Spitzbergen, under the 79th degree
of latitude. For the rea&s;ons already given, there
is no occa&s;ion to dread ice, even under the Pole
it&s;elf; for there is no example of a large &s;ea
freezing at a great di&s;tance from land. The on|ly
&s;ea that freezes totally is the Black Sea, which
is narrow, contains little &s;alt, and receives from
the northern countries a number of rivers, and
large boards of ice. If we may credit hi&s;torians,
this &s;ea, in the time of the Emperor Coprony|mus,
froze to the depth of 30 cubits. This may
be an exaggeration: But that it freezes every
winter is certain, while open &s;eas, 1000 leagues
nearer the Pole, never do. This can only be
explained from the &s;uperior &s;altne&s;s, and the
comparatively &s;mall quantity of ice-boards which
tho&s;e &s;eas receive.</P>
<P>The&s;e boards of ice, which have been regard|ed
as invincible ob&s;tacles to navigation near the
Poles, only prove the exi&s;tence of large rivers in
the neighbourhood of the places where they ap|pear;
they al&s;o demon&s;trate the exi&s;tence of va&s;t
continents, from which the&s;e rivers derive their
&s;ources; and, therefore, we ought not to be di&s;|couraged
by their appearance: Be&s;ides, very
little reflection will convince us, that the&s;e boards
of ice mu&s;t be confined to particular places;
that it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould occupy the
whole circle in which the &s;outhern continent is
<PB N="148" REF="179">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be contained; and, therefore, if a
different route were taken, we have rea&s;on to
hope for &s;ucce&s;s. From the de&s;cription of New
Holland, given by Dampier, and others, it is
probable, that this part of Terra Au&s;tralis, which
is, perhaps, a part of the &s;outhern continent, is a
country le&s;s antient than what remains to be di&s;|covered.
New Holland lies low; it has neither
mountains nor rivers; it is thinly inhabited, and
the natives have no indu&s;try. All the&s;e circum|&s;tances
induce us to think, that the &s;avages of
New Holland are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Ama|zons,
and of Paraguay in America. In Peru and
Mexico, which are the mo&s;t elevated, and, of
cour&s;e, the mo&s;t antient countries of America,
the manners of the inhabitants were poli&s;hed;
and they were divided into di&s;tinct nations, go|verned
by &s;overeigns and by laws. Savages, on
the contrary, are always found in low and new
countries. Hence we may pre&s;ume, that, in the
elevated and interior parts of the &s;outhern con|tinent,
from which i&s;&s;ue tho&s;e large rivers that
carry down boards of ice to the &s;ea, there are
men united by the bonds of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The interior parts of Africa are nearly as little
known to us as they were to the antients. They
had circumnavigated this immen&s;e penin&s;ula;
but they have neither left us charts, nor de&s;crip|tions
of its coa&s;ts. Pliny tells us, that this voyage
was performed in the days of Alexander the
Great; that the wrecks of &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;hips
<PB N="149" REF="180">
were found in the Arabian &s;ea; and that Hanno,
the Carthaginian general, had &s;ailed from Gades
to the Arabian gulf, and had written a relation
of the voyage. He farther informs us, that, in
the days of Cornelius Nepos, one Eudoxus,
who had been per&s;ecuted by King Lathurus, was
obliged to fly; that he departed from the Ara|bic
gulf, and arrived at Gades; and that, previ|ous
to this period, Spain carried on a trade by
&s;ea with Aethiopia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. 2.</NOTE>. But, the&s;e antient te&s;ti|monies
notwith&s;tanding, we are of opinion, that
they never doubled the Cape of Good Hope;
and every man con&s;idered the voyage of the
Portugue&s;e to the Ea&s;t Indies as a new di&s;cove|ry.
It will not be incurious to &s;ee the &s;enti|ments
entertained of this &s;ubject in the ninth
century. 'In our days, a di&s;covery has been
made which was totally unknown to tho&s;e
who lived before us. No man believed, or
could &s;u&s;pect, that the &s;ea which reaches from
the Indies to China had any communication
with the &s;ea of Syria. But we have lately
found, according to my information, in the
Mediterranean, or &s;ea of <HI>Roum,</HI> the wreck of
an Arabian &s;hip which had been &s;taved to
pieces by a tempe&s;t; &s;ome of the&s;e pieces had
been carried, by the wind and the waves, into
the &s;ea of the Cozars; from thence round to the
Mediterranean, and along that &s;ea to the coa&s;t
of Syria. This is a demon&s;tration that the
<PB N="150" REF="181">
ocean &s;urrounds China and Cila, the extremity
of Turque&s;ton, and the country of the Cozars,
and that, at la&s;t, it enters by the Straits, and
wa&s;hes the borders of Syria. The evidence
ari&s;es from the con&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;el; for
there are no &s;hips but tho&s;e of Siraf who&s;e
planks are not nailed. But the ve&s;&s;el above
mentioned had all her planks &s;titched together
in a manner peculiar to the Arabians. But
all ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Mediterranean, and
coa&s;t of Syria, have their timbers fa&s;tened with
nails<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les anciennes relationes de voyages faits par terre a la Chine, p. 53.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubjoin the remarks added by the tran&s;|lator
of this antient relation.</P>
<P>'Abuziel remarks, as a thing perfectly new,
that a ve&s;&s;el had been carried from the Indian
&s;ea, and thrown upon the coa&s;t of Syria. To
find a pa&s;&s;age for it into the Mediterranean,
he &s;uppo&s;es, that there is a great extent of &s;ea
beyond China, which communicates with the
&s;ea of the Cozars, or of Mu&s;covia. The &s;ea
beyond Cape Current was entirely unknown
to the Arabians, on account of the extreme
hazard of navigating it, and becau&s;e the con|tinent
was inhabited by a people &s;o barbarous,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible either to conquer them,
or to civilize them by commerce. The Por|tugue&s;e
found not, from the Cape of Good
Hope to Soffala, any Moors who had an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="151" REF="182">
&s;ettlement, like tho&s;e in all the maritime
villages as far as China, which was the farthe&s;t
place known to geographers. But they could
not tell whether the Chine&s;e &s;ea communi|cated
with that of Barbary by the extremity
of Africa; they only de&s;cribed it to the coa&s;t
of Zinga or Caffraria. We cannot, therefore,
he&s;itate in pronouncing, that the fir&s;t di&s;covery
of the pa&s;&s;age of this &s;ea, by the Cape of Good
Hope, was made by the Europeans, under the
command of Va&s;co de Gama, or, at lea&s;t, a
few years before he doubled that Cape, if we
may credit &s;ome &s;ea charts of an older date,
where the Cape is marked under the name of
<HI>Fronteira da Africa.</HI> Antony Galvan relates,
upon the te&s;timony of Franci&s;co de Sou&s;a Ta|vares,
that, in 1528, the Infant Don Ferdi|nand
&s;hewed him a &s;imilar chart from the
mona&s;tery of Acoboca, dated 120 years before,
copied, perhaps, from that &s;aid to be in the
trea&s;ury of St Marc at Venice, on which the
point of Africa is likewi&s;e delineated, accor|ding
to the evidence of Ramu&s;io,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>The ignorance of the&s;e ages concerning the
navigation round Africa is not, perhaps, &s;o
&s;ingular as the &s;ilence of the editor of this an|tient
relation with regard to the pa&s;&s;ages in He|rodotus,
Pliny, &amp;c. which we have quoted, and
which prove that the antients had &s;ailed round
Africa.</P>

However this matter &s;tands, the coa&s;ts of Afri|ca
are now well known. But all the attempts
that have been made to penetrate into the interior
parts, have not furni&s;hed us with exact accounts.
It would be a great object to go far up the coun|try,
by means of Senegal, or &s;ome other great
river, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ettlements. According to
every appearance, we &s;hould there find a coun|try
as rich in precious metals as Peru or Bra&s;il.
It is well known, that the rivers of Africa a|bound
in gold du&s;t; and, as the country is very
high and mountainous, and is, be&s;ides, &s;ituated
under the equator, it admits not a doubt, that it
contains, as well as America, mines of the hea|vie&s;t
metals, and &s;tones of the harde&s;t and of the
mo&s;t compact texture.</P>
<P>The va&s;t extent of north and ea&s;t Tartary is
but a late di&s;covery. If the Ru&s;&s;ian charts be
ju&s;t, we know the whole coa&s;t of this part of
A&s;ia; and it appears, that, from the termination
of Ea&s;t Tartary to North America, is not above
400 or 500 leagues. It has even been lately re|duced
to a much &s;horter &s;pace. In the Am&s;ter|dam
Gazette of 24th January 1747, under the
article Peter&s;burgh, it is alledged, that M. Stalle|ravoit
had di&s;covered, beyond Kamt&s;chatka, one
of the North American i&s;les, and that he had de|mon&s;trated
that we might pa&s;s from Ru&s;&s;ia to
America by a very &s;hort pa&s;&s;age. The Je&s;uites
and other mi&s;&s;ionaries al&s;o pretended to have
known &s;avages in Tartary, whom they had ca|techized
in America, which &s;uppo&s;es the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="153" REF="188">
to be indeed very &s;hort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 30.</NOTE>. Charlevoix would
have us believe, that the old and new continents
are united in the northern parts. He &s;ays, that
&s;ome late voyages of the Japane&s;e make it pro|bable
that the pa&s;&s;age we have been mentioning
is only a bay, beyond which we may pa&s;s, by
land, from A&s;ia to America. But this notion
requires confirmation; for it has always been
thought, that the continent of the North Pole is
probably &s;eparated from all other continents, as
well as that of the South Pole.</P>
<P>A&s;tronomy and navigation have reached to &s;o
high a pitch of perfection, that we may rea&s;on|ably
hope &s;oon to have an exact knowledge of
the whole &s;urface of the globe. The antients,
who were ignorant of the mariner's compa&s;s,
were able to di&s;cover only a &s;mall part of it.
Some pretend that the Arabians invented this
in&s;trument, and that, by means of it, they car|ried
on trade with India as far as China<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See l'Abreg&eacute; de l'hi&s;t. des Sarazins de Bergeron, p. 119.</NOTE>. But
this notion has always appeared to me to be de|&s;titute
of foundation; for there is not in the
Arabian, Turki&s;h, or Per&s;ian languages, a word
that &s;ignifies a mariner's compa&s;s: They u&s;e the
Italian word <HI>bo&s;&s;ola.</HI> Even at this moment, they
can neither make compa&s;&s;es nor give polarity
to the needle. They purcha&s;e them from the
Europeans. Father Martini alledges, that the Chi|ne&s;e
have been acquainted with the compa&s;s the&s;e
<PB N="154" REF="189">
3000 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See hi&s;t. Sinicae, p. 106.</NOTE>. If the&s;e facts be true, how &s;hould
it happen that they have made &s;o little u&s;e of it?
Why, in their voyages to Cochinchina did they
take a longer cour&s;e than was nece&s;&s;ary? Why
did they always limit them&s;elves to the &s;ame ex|peditions,
the longe&s;t of which was to Java and
Sumatra? And why did they not di&s;cover, be|fore
the Europeans, a va&s;t variety of i&s;lands and
of fertile countries in their own neighbourhood,
if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of navigating in the o|pen
&s;eas? It was but a few years after the di&s;|covery
of this wonderful quality of the load|&s;tone,
that the Portugue&s;e doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, and traver&s;ed the African and In|dian
oceans, and that Chri&s;topher Columbus
&s;ailed to America.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to conjecture, that immen&s;e
regions exi&s;ted in the we&s;tern part of the globe;
for, on computing what was known of it, name|ly,
the di&s;tance from Spain to China, and attend|ing
to the revolution of the earth, or of the hea|vens,
it was ea&s;y to perceive, that a greater ex|tent
lay to the we&s;t than what had been already
di&s;covered on the ea&s;t. That the antients found
not the new world, was not owing to a deficien|cy
in a&s;tronomical &s;cience, but &s;olely to their
ignorance of the compa&s;s. The pa&s;&s;ages of Plato
and of Ari&s;totle, which mention countries far
beyond the Pillars of Hercules, &s;eem to indicate
that &s;ome mariners had been driven by a tempe&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="190">
on the coa&s;t of America, from which they had
returned with infinite labour. But, &s;uppo&s;ing
the antients had been thoroughly convinced that
&s;uch a continent exi&s;ted, being ignorant of the
compa&s;s, they could not po&s;&s;ibly derive any ad|vantage
from it.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that it is not ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible
for re&s;olute men, with no other guide
than the &s;tars, to &s;ail in open &s;eas. The antients
were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the A&s;trolabe. They might
take their departure from France or Spain, and
&s;ail to the we&s;t by always keeping the polar &s;tar
on the right hand; and, by frequent &s;oundings,
they might keep nearly in the &s;ame latitude. It
was unque&s;tionably by keeping the pole-&s;tar on
their left, that the Carthaginians mentioned by
Ari&s;totle were enabled to return from the&s;e di&s;tant
regions. But it will &s;till be allowed, that &s;uch
a voyage mu&s;t have been regarded as a ra&s;h and
hazardous enterpri&s;e. We ought not, therefore,
to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that the antients never conceived
&s;uch a project.</P>
<P>Before the expedition of Columbus, the
Azores, the Canaries, and Madeira, had been
di&s;covered. It had been remarked, that, when
the we&s;t winds continued long to blow, the &s;ea
threw upon the coa&s;ts of the&s;e i&s;lands pieces of
&s;trange wood, canes of an unknown &s;pecies, and
even dead bodies, which, by &s;everal marks, were
known to be neither Europeans nor Africans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="191">
Columbus him&s;elf remarked, that, on the we&s;t
coa&s;ts, certain winds blew for &s;ome days, which
he was per&s;uaded proceeded from land. But,
though he had all the&s;e advantages over the an|tients,
and likewi&s;e the compa&s;s, the difficulties
to be encountered were &s;o great, that nothing
le&s;s than &s;ucce&s;s could have ju&s;tified the en|terpri&s;e.
Suppo&s;e, for a moment, that the
continent of America had been 1000 or 1500
leagues more di&s;tant, a circum&s;tance which Co|lumbus
could neither fore&s;ee nor prevent, he
never would have arrived, and perhaps this va&s;t
country might &s;till have remained undi&s;covered.
This conjecture receives additional force, when
it is con&s;idered, that Columbus, though the able&s;t
navigator of his age, was &s;eized with terror and
a&s;toni&s;hment in his &s;econd voyage to the New
World: As, in his fir&s;t voyage, he found no|thing
but i&s;lands, he directed his cour&s;e more to
the &s;outh in que&s;t of a continent; but found
him&s;elf &s;topped by currents, the great extent of
which, and their uniform oppo&s;ition to his cour&s;e,
obliged him to direct his &s;earch more to the we&s;t.
He imagined, that it was not currents which
prevented him from advancing to the &s;outh, but
that the &s;ea was ri&s;ing to the heavens, and that
both perhaps touched each other in the &s;outhern
parts: Thus, in great undertakings, the mo&s;t
trifling difficulty may &s;ometimes turn a man's
brain, and extingui&s;h his courage.</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Formation of Strata, or Beds in the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>WE have demon&s;trated, in the fir&s;t article,
that the earth, in con&s;equence of the
mutual attraction between the particles of mat|ter,
and of the centrifugal force which re&s;ults
from its diurnal revolution, behoved to a&s;&s;ume
the figure of a &s;pheroid, the two diameters of
which differ about a 230th part; and that no|thing
but the changes made on its &s;urface by the
motions of the air and of the waters, could aug|ment
this difference, in the manner alledged by
tho&s;e who mea&s;ured a degree under the equator,
and another within the polar circle. This fi|gure
of the earth, which agrees &s;o well with the
laws of hydro&s;tatics and with our theory, indi|cates
<PB N="158" REF="193">
that, at the time it a&s;&s;umed its figure, it
was in a &s;tate of fluidity. We have al&s;o pro|ved,
that the projectile motion, and the motion
of rotation, were impre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time, and
by the &s;ame impul&s;e. It will the more readily
be admitted, that the earth was originally in a
&s;tate of liquefaction, when it is con&s;idered, that
the greate&s;t part of the materials of which this
globe is compo&s;ed, are either vitrifications, or vi|trifiable
by fire. The impo&s;&s;ibility of rendering
the earth fluid by the operation of waters con|firms
this hypothe&s;is; becau&s;e there is infinitely
more earth than water; and the water is not
able to di&s;&s;olve &s;and, rocks, and hard minerals.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, evident, that the earth a&s;&s;um|ed
its figure when in a melted &s;tate: And, to
pur&s;ue our theory, it is natural to think, that
the earth, when it i&s;&s;ued from the &s;un, had no
other form but that of a torrent of melted and
inflamed matter; that this torrent, by the mu|tual
attraction of its parts, took on a globular
figure, which its diurnal motion changed into a
&s;pheroid; that, when the earth cooled, the va|pours,
which are expanded like the tail of a co|met,
gradually conden&s;ed, fell down in the form
of water upon the &s;urface, depo&s;iting, at the
&s;ame time, a &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance, mixed with &s;ul|phur
and &s;alts, part of which was carried, by
the motion of the waters, into the perpendicu|lar
fi&s;&s;ures of the &s;trata, and produced metals;
and the re&s;t remained on the &s;urface, and gave
<PB N="159" REF="194">
ri&s;e to the vegetable mould, which abounds, in
different places, with more or le&s;s of animal and
vegetable particles, the organization of which is
not obvious to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus the interior parts of the globe were ori|ginally
compo&s;ed of vitrified matter; and, I
believe, they continue &s;o at pre&s;ent. Above this
vitrified matter, were placed tho&s;e bodies which
the fire had reduced into the &s;malle&s;t particles,
as &s;ands, which are only portions of gla&s;s; and,
above the&s;e, pumice &s;tones, and the &s;coriae of
melted matter, which produced the different
clays. The whole was covered with water to
to the depth of 5 or 600 feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This opinion, that the earth was entirely covered with wa|ter, corre&s;ponds with the &s;entiments of &s;everal antient philo&s;o|phers, and likewi&s;e with tho&s;e of many of the fathers of the church. In mundi primordio, aqua in omnem terram &s;tagna|bat, &s;ays St John of Dama&s;cus, lib. 2. cap. 9. Terra erat in|vi&s;ibilis, quia exundabat aqua et operiebat terram; St Ambro&s;e, lib. 1. cap. 8. Submer&s;a tellus cum e&s;&s;et, faciem ejus inundante aqua, non erat ad&s;pectabilis; St Ba&s;ile, Hom. 2. See likewi&s;e St Augu&s;tine, lib. 1. cap. 12.</NOTE>, which origina|ted
from the conden&s;ation of the vapours, when
the earth began to cool. This water depo&s;ited
a &s;tratum of mud, mixed with all tho&s;e matters
which are capable of being &s;ublimed or exhaled
by fire; and the air was formed of the mo&s;t
&s;ubtile vapours, which, from their levity, ro&s;e
above the water.</P>
<P>Such was the condition of the earth, when
the tides, the winds, and the heat of the &s;un,
began to introduce changes on its &s;urface. The
<PB N="160" REF="195">
diurnal motion of the earth, and that of the
tides, elevated the waters in the equatorial re|gions,
and nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;ported thither great
quantities of &s;lime, clay, and &s;and, and by thus
elevating the&s;e parts of the earth, they perhaps
&s;ank tho&s;e under the poles about two leagues,
as was formerly remarked: For the waters
would ea&s;ily reduce into powder pumice-&s;tones,
and other &s;pungy parts of the vitrified matter
upon the &s;urface, and, by this means, excavate
&s;ome places, and elevate others, which, in time,
would produce i&s;lands and continents, and all
tho&s;e inequalities on the &s;urface, which are more
con&s;iderable towards the equator than the poles.
The highe&s;t mountains lie between the Tropics
and the middle of the Temperate Zones, and the
lowe&s;t from the polar circles towards the poles.
Between the Tropics are the Cordeliers, mo&s;t of
the mountains of Mexico and the Bra&s;ils, the
great and le&s;&s;er Atlas, the mountains of the
Moon, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, both the land and the &s;ea
have mo&s;t inequalities between the tropics, as is
evident from the incredible number of i&s;lands
peculiar to tho&s;e regions.</P>
<P>However independent this hypothe&s;is, con|cerning
the original &s;tate of the globe, may be
of my general theory, I have cho&s;en to refer to
it in this article, to &s;how the connection and
po&s;&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem endeavoured to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in the fir&s;t article. It may only be re|marked,
that my theory is not oppo&s;ed by the
<PB N="161" REF="196">
facts; that I take the earth nearly as it &s;tands
at pre&s;ent; and that I lay hold of none of tho&s;e
&s;uppo&s;itions which are often u&s;ed in rea&s;oning
concerning the former condition of this globe.
But, as I here offer a new idea upon this &s;ub|ject
of the &s;ediment depo&s;ited by the waters,
which, in my opinion, gave ri&s;e to the upper
&s;tratum of the earth, it will not be improper to
exhibit the rea&s;ons upon which it is founded.</P>
<P>The vapours exhaled from the earth produce
rain, dews, thunder, lightening, and other mete|ors.
The&s;e vapours, therefore, are mixed with
particles of water, air, &s;ulphur, earth, &amp;c.; and
it is the &s;olid earthy particles which con&s;titute
the &s;lime or mud under con&s;ideration. The
pure&s;t rain-water depo&s;ites a quantity of this
mud; and, when a quantity of dew is collected,
and allowed to corrupt, it produces a greater
proportional quantity of mud, which is fat,
unctuous, and of a reddi&s;h colour.</P>
<P>The upper &s;tratum of the earth is compo&s;ed
of this mud, mixed with particles of animal and
vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, or rather with particles of
&s;tone and &s;and. It may be remarked, that mo&s;t
arable land is reddi&s;h, and more or le&s;s blended
with heterogeneous matters. The particles of
&s;tone or of &s;and found in it are of two kinds;
the one is gro&s;s and heavy, the other fine, and
&s;ometimes impalpable. The gro&s;s is detached
from the inferior &s;tratum by labouring the
ground; or rather, the upper &s;tratum, by pene|trating
<PB N="162" REF="197">
the inferior, which is compo&s;ed of &s;and
or gravel, forms what is called <HI>fat,</HI> or <HI>fertile
&s;and.</HI> The finer &s;pecies proceeds from the air,
falls down with the dew or rain, and intimately
incorporates with the vegetable mould, or upper
&s;tratum. This la&s;t is nothing more than the
du&s;t, tran&s;ported by the air, and again depo&s;ited
during a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere. When the quantity
of this mud is great, in proportion to the par|ticles
of &s;tone or &s;and, the &s;oil is red and fer|tile;
if it be con&s;iderably mixed with animal
and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, it is blacki&s;h; but, if
the quantity of mud, and of vegetable and ani|mal
&s;ub&s;tances be &s;mall, the &s;oil is white and
barren; and, even when the particles of &s;and,
&s;tone, or chalk, which compo&s;e the&s;e barren
&s;oils, are mixed with a con&s;iderable quantity of
animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, they become
black and light, but have very little fertility.
According, therefore, to the different proportions
of the&s;e three ingredients, &s;oils are more or le&s;s
fertile, and differently coloured.</P>
<P>In order to acquire di&s;tinct ideas concerning
the &s;trata of the earth, we &s;hall take for an ex|ample
the pits at Marly-la-Ville, which are ex|ceedingly
deep. It is &s;ituated in a high, but
flat and fertile country, and its &s;trata lie hori|zontally.
I procured &s;pecimens of all the&s;e &s;trata
in their order from M. Dalibard, an eminent
botani&s;t, and a man of &s;cience; and, after ha|ving
proved the matters they re&s;pectively con&s;i&s;t

<P>I mentioned above, that I had examined all
the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances with aqua fortis, becau&s;e no o|ther
te&s;t can enable us to make real di&s;tinctions
between earthy bodies of the &s;ame or of different
appearances. Tho&s;e which efferve&s;ce and &s;ud|denly
di&s;&s;olve on the application of the aqua
fortis, are generally calcinable. Tho&s;e, on the
other hand, upon which that acid makes no im|pre&s;&s;ion,
are vitrifiable.</P>
<P>From the above enumeration of &s;trata it is e|vident,
that that the land at Marly-la-ville was for|merly
covered with the &s;ea, to the depth of 75
feet, &s;ince &s;hells are found 75 feet below the
&s;urface. Tho&s;e &s;hells have been collected and
depo&s;ited by the water, along with the &s;and
which contains them; and the whole &s;uperior
&s;trata, excepting the uppermo&s;t, have been tran&s;|ported
thither by the motion of the waters, and
<PB N="166" REF="201">
depo&s;ited in the form of &s;ediment, as is appa|rent
from their horizontal po&s;ition, from the
mixture of &s;and, &s;hells, and marle, which la&s;t is
compo&s;ed of decayed &s;hells; and even the up|per
&s;tratum has been almo&s;t wholly formed of
&s;lime or mud, with a &s;mall mixture of marle.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en this example, becau&s;e it is lea&s;t
favourable to my theory; for it appears, at fir&s;t
view, difficult to conceive how the mud depo|&s;ited
by the dew and rains &s;hould produce a
bed of vegetable &s;oil 13 feet thick. But it
ought to be remarked, that a &s;oil of this thick|ne&s;s
is rarely to be found, e&s;pecially in high
countries. The general run of &s;oils are from
three to four feet, and often they exceed not
one foot. The &s;oil is thicke&s;t in plains &s;ur|rounded
with hills; becau&s;e the rains daily bring
fre&s;h &s;upplies from the higher grounds. But,
ab&s;tracting from this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is plain, that
the upper &s;trata formed by the &s;ea, are thick
beds of marle. It is natural to think, that the
upper &s;tratum, above mentioned, was originally
much thicker, and that, be&s;ides the 13 feet, the
&s;ea would leave a con&s;iderable quantity of marle.
But this marle, being expo&s;ed to the action of
the air, of rains, and of the rays of the &s;un,
would &s;oon be reduced into a fine powder. The
&s;ea would not leave this land &s;uddenly, but
would continue for &s;om time occa&s;ionally to
cover it, either by the motion of the tides, or
by extraordinary &s;wells during great &s;torms; and,
<PB N="167" REF="202">
of cour&s;e, the upper &s;tratum would be mixed
with mud, clay, and other &s;limy bodies. After
being entirely above the reach of the waves,
plants would begin to grow, and the &s;oil would
con&s;tantly accumulate, and be tinged with a
reddi&s;h colour, by the mud depo&s;ited from dews
and rain. Culture would &s;till farther increa&s;e
both its fertility and its thickne&s;s, and, by al|lowing
the dews and rains to penetrate deeper,
would in the end produce this &s;oil of 13 feet.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here examine, whether the reddi&s;h
colour of vegetable mould proceeds from a quan|tity
of iron contained in the mud depo&s;ited by
rain and dews. This point, which is of &s;ome
importance, &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed when we come to
treat of minerals. It is &s;ufficient to have given
a view of the manner in which the upper &s;tratum
has been formed: We &s;hall now prove, by other
examples, that the formation of the interior &s;tra|ta
of the earth mu&s;t likewi&s;e have originated
from the operation of the waters.</P>
<P>The upper &s;tratum of the globe, &s;ays Wood|ward,
that magazine for the formation and &s;up|port
of animals and vegetables, is mo&s;tly com|po&s;ed
of vegetable and animal matter, and is in
perpetual fluctuation. All the animals and ve|getables
which have exi&s;ted &s;ince the creation,
have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively extracted from this &s;tratum the
materials of which their bodies are con&s;tructed;
the&s;e they again re&s;tore at their di&s;&s;olution, where
they remain prepared for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive forma|tion
<PB N="168" REF="203">
of new bodies of the &s;ame &s;pecies; the mat|ter
which forms one body being naturally di&s;|po&s;ed
to make another of the &s;ame kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Woodward's E&s;&s;ay, p. 136.</NOTE>. In
uninhabited countries, where the woods are
never cut, nor the herbs brouzed by cattle, the
&s;oil is con&s;tantly augmenting. The &s;oil, in all
woods, even in tho&s;e which are occa&s;ionally cut,
is from 6 to 8 feet thick, and has originated
from decayed leaves, and other parts of ve|getables.
I have often remarked, upon an old
Roman way which runs acro&s;s Burgundy, that
the &s;tones with which it was con&s;tructed are
covered with a black mould of more than a foot
thick, and nouri&s;hes trees of a con&s;iderable &s;ize.
This &s;oil could only be produced by the gradual
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive de&s;truction of vegetable bodies.
As vegetables derive more of their &s;ub&s;tance
from the air and from water, than from the earth,
when they decay, they add more to the earth
than they extracted from it. Be&s;ides, fore&s;ts
collect and retain vapours and moi&s;ure; and,
of cour&s;e, in old woods, the &s;oil is greatly aug|mented.
But, as animals re&s;tore much le&s;s to
the earth than they take from it; and, as men
con&s;ume va&s;t quantities of wood and herbs, for
feuel and other purpo&s;es, it follows, that the ve|getable
&s;oil of populous countries mu&s;t conti|nually
dimini&s;h, and become, in time, like that
of Arabia Petrea, and other ea&s;tern countries,
which were fir&s;t inhabited, where nothing is to
<PB N="169" REF="204">
be found but &s;and and &s;alts; for the fixed &s;alts
of plants and of animals remain, while all the
other parts volatilize, and are carried off by the
air.</P>
<P>Let us next examine the po&s;ition and forma|tion
of the interior &s;trata. The earth, &s;ays
Woodward, wherever it has been dug, is com|po&s;ed
of beds or &s;trata, one above another, in
the &s;ame manner as if they had proceeded from
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ediments depo&s;ited by water. The
beds that lie deepe&s;t are thicker than tho&s;e im|mediately
above them, and they grow gradual|ly
thinner till they arive at the &s;urface. Sea-&s;hells,
teeth, and bones of fi&s;hes, are found in
the&s;e beds, and not only in tho&s;e which are &s;oft,
as chalk, clay, and marle, but even in beds of
hard &s;tone, marble, &amp;c. The&s;e productions of
the &s;ea are incorporated with the &s;tone, and,
when &s;eparated, leave in the &s;tone the figure of
their &s;urface exactly delineated. 'I was abun|dantly
a&s;&s;ured,' &s;ays this author, 'that the cir|cum&s;tances
of the&s;e things in remoter coun|tries
were much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of ours
here: That the &s;tone, and other terre&s;trial mat|ter,
in France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy,
Germany, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
was di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;trata, or layers, as it is
in England: That tho&s;e &s;trata were divided by
parallel fi&s;&s;ures: That there were inclo&s;ed in
the &s;tone, and all the other den&s;er kinds of
terre&s;trial matter, great numbers of &s;hells, and
<PB N="170" REF="205">
other productions of the &s;ea; in the &s;ame man|ner
as in that of this i&s;land. To be &s;hort, by
the &s;ame means I got &s;ufficient intelligence that
the&s;e things were found in like manner in Bar|bary,
in Egypt, in Guiney, and other parts of
Africa: In Arabia, Syria, Per&s;ia, Malabar,
China, and other A&s;iatick provinces: In Ja|maica,
Barbadoes, Virginia, New England,
Bra&s;il, Peru, and other parts of America.,
p. 6. 41. 42. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Woodward gives no authority for his a&s;&s;er|tion,
that &s;hells are found in the &s;trata of Peru.
But as, in general, his facts are true, I doubt not
but his information has been good; and I am
per&s;uaded that &s;hells exi&s;t in the &s;trata of Peru,
as well as every where el&s;e. I make this re|mark
on account of a doubt which has been
entertained on this &s;ubject, and which &s;hall af|terwards
be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>In digging a well at Am&s;terdam, 232 feet
deep, the &s;trata were arranged in the following
order: 7 feet of vegetable &s;oil; 9 feet of turf;
9 feet of &s;oft clay; 8 feet of &s;and; 4 of earth;
10 of clay; 4 of earth; 10 of &s;and; 2 of clay;
4 of &s;mall white &s;and; 5 of dry earth; 1 of &s;oft
earth; 14 of &s;and; 8 of clay mixed with &s;and;
4 of &s;and mixed with &s;hells; then 102 feet of
clay; and, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> 31 feet of &s;and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varenii Geograph. gen. p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is uncommon to dig &s;o deep before we find
water: But this experiment is remarkable in
<PB N="171" REF="206">
many other re&s;pects. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It demon&s;trates that
the &s;ea communicates not with the interior parts
of the earth by means of filtration: 2<HI>d,</HI> That
&s;hells are found 100 feet below the &s;urface in a
country extremely low; and, con&s;equently, that
the land of Holland has been elevated 100 feet
by the &s;ediments of the ocean: 3<HI>d,</HI> It may be
concluded, that the bed of clay of 102 feet, and
the bed of &s;and, 31 feet of which only had been
dug, and who&s;e actual thickne&s;s is unknown, lie
near to the antient and original earth, which ex|i&s;ted
before the motion of the waters began to
change its &s;urface. In the fir&s;t article, it was
remarked, that, in order to di&s;cover the antient
earth, we mu&s;t dig in the northern, rather than
in the &s;outhern regions; and in the low and
plain, rather than in the elevated countries.
The&s;e circum&s;tances nearly concurred in the pre|&s;ent
ca&s;e. We only wi&s;h that the pit had been
dug deeper, and that the author had informed
us, whether &s;hells, or other &s;ea-bodies, were in|termixed
with the la&s;t &s;trata of clay and of &s;and.
This experiment confirms what was above ad|vanced,
that the &s;trata are always thicker in pro|portion
to their depth.</P>
<P>The earth con&s;i&s;ts of parallel and horizontal
&s;trata, not in the plains only, but, in general, the
hills and mountains have the &s;ame &s;tructure.
The &s;trata of the mountains are even more con|&s;picuous
than tho&s;e of the plains; for the plains
are commonly covered with great quantities of
<PB N="172" REF="207">
&s;and and earth brought from the higher grounds
by the waters; and, therefore, to find the antient
&s;trata, we mu&s;t dig deeper in the plains than in
the mountains.</P>
<P>I have often remarked, that, when the top of
a mountain is level, its &s;trata are likewi&s;e level;
but, when the top is not horizontal, the &s;trata
follow the direction of its declivity. It has fre|quently
been alledged, that the beds of quarries
incline to the ea&s;t. But in all the chains of
rocks which I have examined, I found, that
the&s;e beds always follow the declivity of the
hill, whether its direction be ea&s;t, we&s;t, &s;outh, or
north. In rai&s;ing &s;tones from the quarry, they
are always &s;eparated according to their natural
po&s;ition; and, if cut in a contrary direction, it is
impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e them of any con&s;iderable &s;ize.
In all good ma&s;onry, the workmen place the
&s;tones in the direction in which they lay in the
quarry. If laid in an oppo&s;ite po&s;ition, they will
&s;pilt, and not be able to re&s;i&s;t the weight of the
incumbent building. Hence we may conclude,
that &s;tones have been originally formed in hori|zontal
beds; that the&s;e beds have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly
accumulated above each other, and have been
compo&s;ed of materials, the re&s;i&s;tance of which is
&s;tronger in that than in any other direction.</P>
<P>Every &s;tratum, of whatever kind, whether it
be horizontal or inclined, is of an equal thick|ne&s;s
through its whole extent. In the quarries
round Paris, the &s;tratum of good &s;tone is but a|bout
<PB N="173" REF="208">
18 or 20 inches thick throughout. In the
quarries of Burgundy, the &s;tone is much thicker.
The &s;ame inequalities take place in marbles.
The white and black marbles are thicker than
tho&s;e that are coloured; and there is a hard &s;tone
with which the people of Burgundy cover their
hou&s;es, that exceeds not an inch in thickne&s;s.
Thus, different &s;trata differ much with regard to
thickne&s;s; but each &s;tratum uniformly pre&s;erves
the &s;ame thickne&s;s through its whole extent.
This difference is &s;o great, that &s;trata are to be
found, from le&s;s than a line, to 1, 10, 20, 30,
and 100 feet thick. Both antient and modern
quarries, which are dug horizontally, the &s;hafts
of mines, and the working of lead, both longi|tudinally
and tran&s;ver&s;ely, prove that &s;trata ex|tend
a great way on all &s;ides. 'It is well known,'
as the hi&s;torian of the academy ob&s;erves, 'that all
&s;tones have originally been a &s;oft pa&s;te, and
that, as &s;tones are almo&s;t every where to be
met with, the &s;urface of the earth, in all the&s;e
places, at lea&s;t to a certain depth, mu&s;t have
con&s;i&s;ted of mud and &s;lime. The &s;hells found
in mo&s;t quarries demon&s;trate, that this mud
was an earth diluted by the water of the &s;ea;
and, con&s;equently, that the &s;ea once covered
all the&s;e places; but the &s;ea could not cover
them, without, at the &s;ame time, covering all
places that were lower, or on the &s;ame level.
Now, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ea could cover
all tho&s;e places where there are quarries, with|out
<PB N="174" REF="209">
covering the whole &s;urface of the globe.
If the mountains were then formed, the &s;ea
mu&s;t al&s;o have covered them; for they are full
of rocks and quarries, and &s;hells are often
found in them.'</P>
<P>'The &s;ea, then,' continues he, 'covered the
whole earth; and hence all the beds of &s;tone
in the plains are horizontal and parallel: The
fi&s;hes, therefore, were the mo&s;t antient inha|bitants
of the globe; for neither land-animals
nor birds could exi&s;t. But how has the &s;ea
retired into tho&s;e va&s;t ba&s;ons which it now oc|cupies?
The mo&s;t natural &s;uppo&s;ition is, that
the earth, at lea&s;t to a certain depth, was not
all equally &s;olid, but inter&s;per&s;ed with va&s;t
vaults or caverns, the arches of which would
remain for a time, and at la&s;t &s;uddenly fall in.
The waters would then ru&s;h into the&s;e hol|lows,
fill them up, and leave a part of the &s;ur|face
dry, which would become a convenient
habitation for land-animals and birds. The
&s;hells found in quarries &s;trongly confirm this
idea; for nothing but the bony parts of fi&s;hes
could be pre&s;erved &s;o long in the earth. Be|&s;ides,
&s;hells commonly lie in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es in cer|tain
parts of the &s;ea, where they remain im|moveable,
and form a &s;pecies of rocks or banks;
they could not, therefore, follow the &s;ea, which
&s;uddenly abandoned them. For this la&s;t rea|&s;on
it is, that we find &s;uch numbers of fo&s;&s;il-&s;hells,
and &s;o few ve&s;tiges of other fi&s;hes, which
<PB N="175" REF="210">
is a farther proof that the waters retired with
rapidity into their pre&s;ent ba&s;ons. When the
vaults &s;unk down, it is very probable that
mountains were elevated by the &s;ame cau&s;e,
and placed upon the &s;urface with rocks and
quarries already formed. But the beds of the&s;e
quarries could not pre&s;erve their original ho|rizontal
po&s;ition, unle&s;s they were rai&s;ed ex|actly
perpendicular to the &s;urface, which would
rarely happen. Thus, as we formerly remark|ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. ann. 1705, p. 30.</NOTE>,
the beds of &s;tone in mountains are all
inclined to the horizon, though they be paral|lel
to each other; for they changed not their
po&s;ition with regard to one another, but with
regard only to the &s;urface of the earth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ann. 1716, p. 14.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The&s;e parallel beds of earth or of &s;tone, which
have been formed by &s;ediments of the ocean,
often extend to con&s;iderable di&s;tances; we even
find, in hills &s;eparated by vallies, beds of the
&s;ame materials upon equal levels. This ob&s;er|vation
has a perfect corre&s;pondence with the
equal altitudes of oppo&s;ite hills. The truth of
this fact may be ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed; for, in all
hills &s;eparated by narrow vallies, where &s;tone
or marble is found on one hill, we uniformly
find the&s;e very &s;ub&s;tances, at the &s;ame level, on
the oppo&s;ite hill. I have traced a quarry of
marble 12 leagues in length; its breadth is al&s;o
con&s;iderable, though I have not been able exact|ly
to a&s;certain it. I have often ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="176" REF="211">
this bed of marble has every where the &s;ame
thickne&s;s; and that, in hills &s;eparated by a val|ley
of 100 feet deep, the &s;ame bed always ap|peared
at the &s;ame altitude. I am firmly per|&s;uaded,
that this ob&s;ervation holds with regard
to all quarries of &s;tone or of marble that contain
&s;hells; but it applies not to beds of free-&s;tone.
We &s;hall afterwards explain why free-&s;tone is
not di&s;per&s;ed, like other matters, in horizontal
beds, but in blocks, irregular both in form and
po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It has likewi&s;e been remarked, that, on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ides of &s;traits of the &s;ea, the &s;trata are
the &s;ame. This ob&s;ervation is important, and
may lead to the di&s;covery of tho&s;e necks of land,
or i&s;lands, that have been &s;eparated from the
Continent. It proves, for example, that Eng|land
has been &s;eparated from France, Spain from
Africa, and Sicily from Italy: And it is to be
regretted, that the &s;ame ob&s;ervation has not been
made upon all &s;traits. I have no doubt but it
will hold univer&s;ally. We know not, whether,
in the &s;traits of Magellan, the longe&s;t we are
acquainted with, the &s;ame &s;trata are to be found
at the &s;ame altitude; but we perceive, from very
exact charts, that the oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts, which are
high, have corre&s;ponding angles like tho&s;e ob|&s;ervable
in our inland mountains; and this fur|ther
proves Terra del Fuego to have been for|merly
a part of the Continent of America. The
&s;ame remark has been made with regard to the
<PB N="177" REF="212">
&s;trait of Forbi&s;her; and the i&s;land of Frie&s;land
appears to have been &s;eparated from the conti|nent
of Greenland.</P>
<P>The Maldiva i&s;lands are &s;eparated from each
other by &s;mall branches of the &s;ea; and on each
&s;ide of the oppo&s;ite i&s;lands, the &s;trata of rocks,
&amp;c. are the &s;ame. The&s;e i&s;lands, which, when
taken together, extend about 200 leagues in
length, were formerly one. They are divided
into 13 provinces, called <HI>Clu&s;ters.</HI> Every Clu&s;ter
contains a great number of &s;mall i&s;lands, mo&s;t
of which will &s;oon be under water. It is re|markable,
that each of the&s;e 13 Clu&s;ters is &s;ur|rounded
with a chain of rocks of the &s;ame &s;tone,
and that there are only three or four &s;mall and
dangerous openings through which each of them
can be approached. They are all placed in a
line, with their ends to each other, and appear
evidently to have been once a long mountain
crowned with rock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyag. de Franc. Pyrard, vol. 1. p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Several authors, as Ver&s;tegan, Twine, Sommer,
but particularly Campbell, in his de&s;cription of
the county of Kent, give &s;triking proofs that
England was formerly joined to France, and that
the neck of land which divides them had been
carried off by the &s;ea, which retired, and left a
great quantity of low mar&s;hy ground along the
&s;outhern coa&s;ts of England. As a farther proof
of this fact, Dr Wallis has attempted to &s;how an
affinity between the antient language of the
<PB N="178" REF="213">
Gauls and of the Britains; and he adds &s;everal
other remarks which &s;hall be related in the fol|lowing
articles.</P>
<P>If travellers ob&s;erved the figure of lands, the
po&s;ition of mountains, and the windings of ri|vers,
they would perceive that oppo&s;ite hills are
not only compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials, at the
&s;ame altitudes, but that they are al&s;o nearly of
an equal height. In all the places where I have
travelled, I uniformly remarked this equality in
the height of oppo&s;ite hills, e&s;pecially when they
are &s;eparated by valleys not above a fourth or a
third of a league wide. In valleys of greater
width, it is difficult to judge of the height or e|quality
of hills; for, on looking over a level
and exten&s;ive plain, it appears to ri&s;e; and di|&s;tant
hills appear to &s;ink. But this is not the
place to account for the&s;e phaenomena. Be|&s;ides,
it is not ea&s;y to determine, by the eye, the
middle of a large valley, unle&s;s there be a river
in it. But, in narrow valleys, the judgment of
the eye is more certain. That part of Burgun|dy
comprehended between Auxerre, Dijon, An|tun,
and Bar-&s;ur-&s;eine, and of which a con|&s;iderable
portion is called <HI>le Bailliage de la
Montagne,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t elevated parts of
France. From one &s;ide of the&s;e mountains,
which are only of the &s;econd order, the water
runs to the ocean, and, from the other, to the
Mediterranean. There are points of partition,
as at Sombernon, Pouilli in Auxois, &amp;c. where
<PB N="179" REF="214">
the water may be turned at plea&s;ure, either to
the ocean or to the Mediterranean. This high
country is inter&s;ected with a number of &s;mall
valleys, and mo&s;t of them are watered with ri|vulets.
Here I have a thou&s;and times ob&s;erved
the corre&s;ponding angles of the hills, and their
equality as to height; and I can with confidence
affirm, that the &s;aliant or prominent angles are
uniformly oppo&s;ed to the concave ones, and that
the heights of the two &s;ides are nearly the &s;ame.
The farther we advance in this high country,
where are the points of partition mentioned a|bove,
the mountains are the higher. But this
height is always the &s;ame on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides
of the valleys, and the hills ri&s;e or fall equally.
The &s;ame ob&s;ervation I have repeatedly made in
&s;everal other provinces of France; but they ex|tend
not to very high mountains; for the&s;e are
more irregular as to height, and often terminate
in unequal points or peaks. In frequently tra|ver&s;ing
the Alps and Appennines, I ob&s;erved,
that the angles, in effect, corre&s;ponded; but that
it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to judge, by the eye, con|cerning
the equality or inequality in the heights
of oppo&s;ite mountains; becau&s;e their tops are
lo&s;t in the clouds.</P>
<P>The different &s;trata compo&s;ing the earth are
not arranged according to their &s;pecific gravities.
Beds of heavy matter are frequently placed
above tho&s;e of lighter. Solid rocks are often
&s;upported by beds of earth, clay, or &s;and, which
<PB N="180" REF="215">
have much le&s;s &s;pecific gravity. This is the ca&s;e
with mo&s;t hills, and is ea&s;ily perceived. But, in
high mountains, the &s;ummits are not only rocks,
but the&s;e rocks are &s;upported by others; and
this &s;tructure runs through &s;uch an extent of
country, where one mountain ri&s;es out of ano|ther,
that it is difficult to determine whether
they are founded on earth, or of what nature
this earth is. I have &s;een rocks cut perpendi|cularly
for &s;ome hundreds of feet; but the&s;e
rocks re&s;ted upon other rocks, without my be|ing
able to perceive where they ended. May
we not, however, be allowed to conclude from
the le&s;s to the greater? Since the rocks of &s;mall
mountains, the ba&s;es of which are vi&s;ible, re&s;t
upon earths le&s;s heavy and le&s;s &s;olid than &s;tone,
is it not rea&s;onable to think, that earth is like|wi&s;e
the ba&s;is of high mountains? Be&s;ides, all I
have here advanced tends to prove, that heavy
bodies might be accumulated, by the motion of
the waters, above light ones; and, if this really
takes place in mo&s;t hills, it is probable that it has
happened in the manner pointed out by my
theory. But, &s;hould it be objected, that I had
no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that, prior to the forma|tion
of mountains, the heavier matter was below
the lighter; I an&s;wer, that I affirm nothing with
regard to this article; becau&s;e there are many
ways by which this effect might be produced,
whether the heavy matter was above or below,
or placed indi&s;criminately: For, in order to
<PB N="181" REF="216">
conceive how the &s;ea could fir&s;t form a moun|tain
of clay, and then crown it with rocks, we
have only to con&s;ider, that the &s;ediments might
be tran&s;ported from different places, and that
they might con&s;i&s;t of different materials. The
&s;ea might tran&s;port from one place &s;everal &s;edi|ments
of clay, and afterwards depo&s;ite &s;ediments
of &s;tony matter; either becau&s;e all the clay at
the bottom, or on the coa&s;ts, was exhau&s;ted,
and then the waves would attack the rocks; or,
rather, becau&s;e the fir&s;t &s;ediments were tran&s;|ported
from one place, and the la&s;t from a dif|ferent
one. Be&s;ides, the latter corre&s;ponds ex|actly
with experience; for, it is a known fact,
that beds of earth, &s;tone, gravel, &s;and, &amp;c. fol|low
no rule of arrangement, but are placed in|differently,
and, as it were, by chance, one above
another.</P>
<P>This chance, however, ought to have &s;ome
rules, which can only be di&s;covered by analogy
and probable conjecture. We have &s;een, that,
according to my theory of the formation of the
globe, that its interior parts &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of vi|trified
matter, &s;imilar to vitrified &s;and, which is
only the fragments of gla&s;s, and of which the
clays are only the &s;coriae, or decompo&s;ed parts.
Agreeable to this &s;uppo&s;ition, the centre of the
earth, and even near to the &s;urface it&s;elf, &s;hould
be compo&s;ed of gla&s;s or vitrified matter, and
above this &s;hould be found &s;and, clay, and other
&s;coriae. Thus the earth, in its original &s;tate,
<PB N="182" REF="217">
was a nucleus of gla&s;s, or of vitrified matter,
either compact like gla&s;s, or divided like &s;and,
(for that circum&s;tance depends on the degree of
heat applied); above this matter was &s;and; and,
la&s;tly, clay. The &s;oil, or external covering,
was produced from the air and the mud of wa|ter;
and it is more or le&s;s thick according to the
&s;ituation of the ground; more or le&s;s coloured,
according to the different mixtures of mud,
&s;and, clay, and the parts of decayed animals and
vegetables; and more or le&s;s fertile, according to
the abundance or deficiency of the&s;e parts. To
&s;how that this account of the formation of &s;and
and clay is not altogether imaginary, I &s;hall add
a few remarks.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the earth, in its fir&s;t &s;tate, to have
been a &s;pheroid of compact gla&s;s, covered with
a thin cru&s;t of pumice-&s;tone, and other &s;coriae
of melted matter. The agitation of the air and
of the water would &s;oon reduce this cru&s;t of
pumice into powder or &s;and, which, by uniting
into ma&s;&s;es, would give ri&s;e to free-&s;tone and
flints, the varieties of which, with regard to co|lour
and den&s;ity, depend upon the different de|grees
of finene&s;s of the &s;and that compo&s;ed
them.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituent parts of &s;and unite by the
application of fire, become very hard, compact,
and more or le&s;s tran&s;parent according to the
purity of the &s;and: But, on the other hand,
when expo&s;ed to the action of the air, it exfo|liates,
<PB N="183" REF="218">
falls down in the form of earth, and may
thus produce clays of different kinds. This du&s;t,
which is &s;ometimes yellow, &s;ometimes brilliant,
and is u&s;ed to dry writings, is nothing el&s;e than
a fine &s;and, &s;omewhat corrupted, and nearly re|duced
to an elementary &s;tate. In time, its par|ticles
become &s;o attenuated and divided, that
they lo&s;e the power of reflecting light, and ac|quire
all the properties of clay. On examining
a piece of clay, many of the&s;e &s;hining or talky
particles appear, they not having yet entirely
lo&s;t their original form. Sand, therefore, in
proce&s;s of time, may produce clay; and this clay,
by a farther divi&s;ion, acquires the qualities of a
mud or &s;lime, a vitrifiable matter of the &s;ame
nature with clay.</P>
<P>This theory is confirmed by daily experience.
In wa&s;hing &s;and, the water becomes impreg|nated
with a black, &s;oft, fatty earth, which is
a genuine clay. The mud &s;wept from &s;treets
paved with free-&s;tone is black and very fat,
and, when dried, it di&s;covers it&s;elf to be an
earth of the &s;ame nature with clay. Clay, taken
from places where there is neither flint nor
free-&s;tone, and diluted with water, always pre|cipitates
a great quantity of vitrifiable &s;and.</P>
<P>But, what clearly demon&s;trates the exi&s;tence
of &s;and, and even of flint and gal&s;s in clay, is,
that the reunion of its parts, by the action of
fire, re&s;tores it to its original form. Clay, when
heated to the degree of calcination, is covered with
<PB N="184" REF="219">
a hard coat of enamel; if its internal parts are
not vitrified, they become &s;o extremely hard, as
to re&s;i&s;t the file; they &s;trike fire with the ham|mer,
and acquire all the properties of flint: A
great degree of heat melts and converts them
into real gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Clay and &s;and, therefore, are &s;ub&s;tances per|fectly
analogous, and of the &s;ame kind. If clay
can be conden&s;ed to flint, and even to gla&s;s, why
may not &s;and, by re&s;olution, become clay?
Gla&s;s appears to be the true elementary earth,
and all mixed bodies are only gla&s;s in di&s;gui&s;e.
Metals, minerals, &s;alts, &amp;c. are only a vitrifiable
earth: Common &s;tone, and other analogous bo|dies,
te&s;taceous and cru&s;taceous &s;hells, &amp;c. are
the only &s;ub&s;tances which cannot be vitrified,
and which &s;eem to form a di&s;tinct cla&s;s. The
former, by the action of fire, may be converted
into a homogeneous, hard, and tran&s;parent &s;ub|&s;tance,
without any diminution of its weight,
and upon which no farther change can be made.
The latter, on the contrary, which con&s;i&s;t of
more active and volatile principles, calcine in
the fire, lo&s;e more than a third of their weight,
and re&s;ume the form of &s;imple earth, without
any other change than the di&s;&s;olution of their
con&s;tituent parts. If the&s;e bodies be excepted,
which are few in number, and of which the
combinations produce few varieties in nature,
all other &s;ub&s;tances, and particularly clay, may
be converted into gla&s;s, and, con&s;equently, are
<PB N="185" REF="220">
only gla&s;s in a decompo&s;ed &s;tate. If the fire
quickly vitrifies the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, gla&s;s it&s;elf,
whether &s;imple, or in the form of &s;and or flint,
naturally, but by a &s;low and in&s;en&s;ible progre&s;s,
re&s;olves into clay.</P>
<P>In countries where flint is the predominant
&s;tone, the fields are commonly &s;trewed with
fragments of it: And, if the place be unculti|vated,
and if the flints have remained long ex|po&s;ed
to the air, without being moved, their up|per
&s;urface is always white; but the &s;urface next
the ground pre&s;erves its natural colour, which is
very brown. When the&s;e flints are broken, the
whitene&s;s appears to be not &s;uperficial only, but
penetrates more or le&s;s into their internal parts,
and forms a belt, which in &s;ome is not very
deep, but, in others, occupies nearly the whole
&s;tone. This white part is &s;omewhat granulated,
perfectly opaque, as tender as free-&s;tone, and
adheres to the tongue like the boles. But the
other portion of the flint is &s;mooth and poli&s;hed,
has neither thread nor grain, and pre&s;erves its o|riginal
colour, its tran&s;parancy, and its hardne&s;s.
When this half decompo&s;ed flint is put into a
furnace, the white part becomes red like a brick,
and the brown part becomes exceedingly white.
Why &s;hall we conclude, with a famous natura|li&s;t,
that flints of this kind are imperfect, and
that they are not old enough to have acquired
their perfect &s;tate? For why &s;hould they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
imperfect? And why &s;hould they be uniformly
<PB N="186" REF="221">
imperfect on the &s;ide only that is expo&s;ed to the
air? It is, on the contrary, much more probable,
that they are changed from their original &s;tate,
and partly decompo&s;ed, and that they are gra|dually
re&s;olving into clay or bole. If this rea|&s;oning
&s;hould appear to be un&s;atisfactory, ex|po&s;e
to the air the harde&s;t and blacke&s;t flint, in
le&s;s than a year the colour of its &s;urface will be
changed; and, if the experiment be farther pro|&s;ecuted,
the flint will be found gradually to lo&s;e
its hardne&s;s, its tran&s;parency, and its other &s;pe|cific
characters, and make daily approaches to
the nature of clay.</P>
<P>Sand undergoes the &s;ame changes as flint.
Every grain of &s;and may, perhaps, be con&s;idered
as a &s;mall flint, and every piece of flint as a col|lection
of fine &s;and cemented together. The
fir&s;t example of the decompo&s;ition of &s;and is
exhibited in that &s;hining, but opaque powder,
called <HI>mica,</HI> with which clay and &s;late are al|ways
impregnated. The quartz, or perfectly
tran&s;parent flints, in decompo&s;ing, produce fat
and &s;oft talks, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Venice and Ru&s;|&s;ia,
which are as ductile and vitrifiable as clay;
and, it appears, that talk is the mean between
gla&s;s, or tran&s;parent flint, and clay; but that the
gro&s;s and impure flints, in decompo&s;ing, are
converted into clay without any intermediate
&s;tate.</P>
<P>Our made gla&s;s undergoes the &s;ame change;
when long expo&s;ed to the air, it decompo&s;es,
and, as it were, corrupts. At fir&s;t, it takes on a
<PB N="187" REF="222">
number of colours, then it exfoliates, and, in
handling it, we perceive that many &s;hining par|ticles
fall off. But, when its decompo&s;ition is
farther advanced, it brui&s;es between the fingers,
and is reduced to a very white, talky, and impal|pable
powder. Art al&s;o imitates nature in the
decompo&s;ition of gla&s;s and flint. 'E&s;t etiam

<P>The&s;e matters &s;hall be more fully con&s;idered
when we come to treat of metals. We &s;hall
here only add, that the different &s;trata of the
globe, con&s;i&s;t either of materials which may
be con&s;idered as actual vitrifications, or analo|gous
to gla&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential
qualities; and that it is al&s;o evident, from the
decompo&s;ition of gla&s;s and of flint, which daily
takes place, there re&s;ults a genuine clay; we
may therefore conclude, with a high degree of
probability, that &s;and and clays have originally
been the &s;coriae of burnt matter, e&s;pecially when

<HEAD>Of Shells, and other productions of the Sea, found
in the Interior Parts of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often examined quarries, the &s;tones of
which were full of &s;hells; I have &s;een whole
hills compo&s;ed of &s;hells, and chains of rocks in|termixed
with &s;hells through their whole extent.
The quantity of &s;hells, and other productions
of the &s;ea, is, in many places, &s;o prodigious, that
one could with difficulty believe that any more
of them exi&s;ted in their natural element. It is
from this enormous quantity that no doubt re|mains
of the earth's having continued for a very
long time under the waters of the &s;ea. The
number of &s;ea-&s;hells found in a fo&s;&s;il or petri|fied
&s;tate is &s;o amazing, that, were it not for
<PB N="189" REF="224">
this circum&s;tance, we never &s;hould have had a
proper idea of the &s;urpri&s;ing quantities of tho&s;e
animals to which the ocean gives birth. We
mu&s;t not, therefore, imagine, like tho&s;e who
talk and rea&s;on concerning things they never
&s;aw, that &s;hells are only to be found &s;cattered
here and there by chance, or in &s;mall heaps, like
tho&s;e of oi&s;ters thrown from our doors. They
appear, on the contrary, in ma&s;&s;es like moun|tains,
in banks of 100 or 200 leagues in length;
they may often be traced through whole pro|vinces,
and in ma&s;&s;es of 50 or 60 feet thick.
It is only after having learned the&s;e facts that a
man is entitled to rea&s;on on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;hells of Turenne may &s;erve as a &s;triking
example. Let us attend to the de&s;cription given
of them by the hi&s;torian of the Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann&eacute;e 1720, p. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Though figured &s;tones, and even fo&s;&s;il &s;hells
found in the bowels of the earth, were remark|ed
in all ages and nations, they were generally
con&s;idered, even by philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, as
lu&s;us naturae, their production was a&s;cribed to
chance, or &s;ome unaccountable and fortuitous
train of circum&s;tances; and, of cour&s;e, this
wonderful phaenomenon added nothing to the
&s;tock of knowledge. An ignorant potter in
Paris, who knew neither Greek nor Latin, to|wards
the end of the 16th century, was the fir&s;t
man<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The corre&s;pondence of Pali&s;&s;y's ideas with tho&s;e of the antients, is worth remarking. 'Conchulas, arenas, buccinas, calculos varie infectos, frequenti &s;olo, quibu&s;dam etiam in mon|tibus reperiri, certum &s;ignum maris alluvione eos coopertos locos volunt Herodotus. Plato, Strabo, Seneca, Tertullianus, Plutarchus, Ovidius, et alii;' Vide Dau&s;qui, Terra et aqua, p. 7.</NOTE> who ventured, in oppo&s;ition to all the
<PB N="190" REF="225">
learned, to affirm, that fo&s;&s;il &s;hells were real
&s;hells originally depo&s;ited, by the &s;ea, in tho&s;e
places where they were found; that real ani|mals,
and particularly fi&s;hes, be&s;towed on fi|gured
&s;tones their various forms, &amp;c.; and he
boldly defied the whole &s;chool of Ari&s;totle to
invalidate his proofs. His name was Bernard
Pali&s;&s;y; and he was perhaps the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous
example of a philo&s;ophical genius, un|improved
by art or learning. His &s;y&s;tem,
however, has lain dormant for near a century,
and even his name has almo&s;t been forgot.
At la&s;t, &s;everal philo&s;ophers revived Pali&s;&s;y's
ideas; and &s;cience has derived great advantage
from all the fo&s;&s;il &s;hells and figured &s;tones
that have appeared in the earth: They are
now, perhaps, become too common, and the
con&s;equences drawn from them too incon|te&s;tible.'</P>
<P>'But Reaumur's late ob&s;ervations on the &s;ub|&s;ubject
are a&s;toni&s;hing. He di&s;covered a ma&s;s
below ground of 130,680,000 cubic fathoms
of &s;hells, either whole or in fragments, with|out
the lea&s;t mixture of &s;tone, earth, &s;and, or
other foreign matter. Before this remarkable
in&s;tance, fo&s;&s;il &s;hells never appeared in &s;uch
enormous quantities, nor without being mixed
<PB N="191" REF="226">
with other bodies. This prodigious ma&s;s lies in
Turenne, more than 36 leagues from the &s;ea.
It is of great &s;ervice to the pea&s;ants of that
province; they u&s;e the &s;hells for marle in ferti|lizing
their lands, which would otherwi&s;e be
perfectly barren.'</P>
<P>'What the pea&s;ants dig out of the earth, to
the depth of eight or nine feet, con&s;i&s;ts only of
fragments of &s;hells; but the&s;e fragments are
ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed to be tho&s;e of real &s;hells; for
they &s;till retain their original channels or
furrows, and have only lo&s;t their lu&s;tre and
varni&s;h, as mo&s;t &s;hells do, after having re|mained
long under ground. The &s;malle&s;t
fragments are only du&s;t; but we know them
to be the du&s;t of &s;hells, becau&s;e they con&s;i&s;t of
the very &s;ame matter with the larger frag|ments,
and the entire &s;hells, which are &s;ome|times
found. The &s;pecies both of the large
fragments and of the entire &s;hells, are ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hable. Some of the&s;e &s;pecies belong
to the coa&s;t of Poitou, and others of them to
foreign &s;hores. This ma&s;s likewi&s;e furni&s;hes
corals, and other productions of the &s;ea. <HI>Falun</HI>
is the name by which this matter is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
in that province; and it is found, wherever
the ground is dug, through an extent of about
nine leagues &s;quare. The pea&s;ants never dig
deeper than about 20 feet; becau&s;e, &s;ays Reau|mar,
they imagine that the expence of labour
would exceed the value of the commodity.
<PB N="192" REF="227">
They might, however, dig deeper. But our
calculation of 130,680,000 cubic fathoms pro|ceeds
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of only 18 feet deep,
and 2200 fathoms to the league. Every article,
therefore, is undervalued, and this ma&s;s of &s;hells
mu&s;t greatly exceed the above calculation; if
the quantity be only doubled, this wonderful
phaenomenon will be greatly augmented.'</P>
<P>'In phy&s;ical facts, there are little circum&s;tan|ces
often overlooked by the bulk of mankind,
which are, notwith&s;tanding, of great con&s;e|quence
in illu&s;trating the &s;ubject. M. de Reau|mur
has remarked, that all the fragments
of &s;hells lie horizontally in the great ma&s;s;
from which he concludes, that the fragments
were not depo&s;ited at the &s;ame time with the
entire &s;hells which originally formed this ma&s;s;
becau&s;e, &s;ays he, the &s;uperior &s;hells would, by
their weight, have broken the inferior ones,
and the fragments, in that ca&s;e, would nece&s;|&s;arily
have been di&s;po&s;ed in a thou&s;and differ|ent
directions. The whole, therefore, whe|ther
entire or broken, mu&s;t have been gradual|ly
tran&s;ported thither by the &s;ea, and, of cour&s;e,
their po&s;ition mu&s;t have been horizontal; and,
though time alone was &s;ufficient to break them
down, and even to calcine them, it could not
vary their original po&s;ition. Their tran&s;porta|tion
mu&s;t have been gradual; for, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
that &s;uch an immen&s;e number of &s;hells
could be &s;uddenly crouded together, and yet
<PB N="193" REF="228">
pre&s;erve a po&s;ition uniformly horizontal; and
their being a&s;&s;embled in one place, demon|&s;trates
this place to have once been the bottom
of a gulf or ba&s;on.'</P>
<P>'Though there are many ve&s;tiges of the uni|ver&s;al
deluge recorded in &s;cripture; yet the
ma&s;s of &s;hells at Turenne could not be an ef|fect
of this deluge. Perhaps &s;uch an amazing
ma&s;s is no where to be found, even in the bot|tom
of the &s;ea. But, &s;uppo&s;ing the deluge to
have forced &s;uch a quantity from the ocean,
they would nece&s;&s;arily be carried off with vio|lence
and precipitation; and, con&s;equently,
could never have been depo&s;ited in the &s;ame
po&s;ition. It behoved them to have been tran&s;|ported,
&s;lowly floating in the waves; and, of
cour&s;e, their accumulation would require a
much longer time than a year.'</P>
<P>'Upon the whole, it is plain, that, either be|fore
or after the deluge, the earth, at lea&s;t &s;ome
parts of it, mu&s;t have been in a very different
&s;ituation from what it now appears; that the &s;ea
and land mu&s;t have had a different arrangement;
and, that there was formerly a great gulf in the
middle of Turenne. The changes recorded in
hi&s;tory, or even in antient fable, are incon&s;ide|rable;
but they give us &s;ome idea of what
might be produced in a long &s;eries of ages. M.
de Reaumur conjectures, that Turenne was
formerly a gulf of the &s;ea, and that the &s;hells
were tran&s;ported by a current. But this is only
<PB N="194" REF="229">
a mere conjecture, thrown out to &s;upply the
place of a fact as yet imperfectly known. Be|fore
any certain conclu&s;ion can be drawn, we
mu&s;t have geographical charts of all tho&s;e
places where &s;hells are found below the &s;urface
of the earth. To accompli&s;h this, much time
and numberle&s;s ob&s;ervations are requi&s;ite.
Science, however, may in time, perhaps, be
carried thus far.'</P>
<P>An attention to the following circum&s;tances
will le&s;&s;en our &s;urpri&s;e at this great collection of
&s;hells: 1. Shell-fi&s;h multiply prodigiou&s;ly, and
come to maturity in a very &s;hort time. The
multitude of individuals in every &s;pecies, is a
demon&s;tration of their amazing fertility. In a
&s;ingle day, for example, a ma&s;s of oy&s;ters, of
&s;everal fathoms in thickne&s;s, is often rai&s;ed; the
rocks to which they are attached, dimini&s;h con|&s;iderably
in a &s;hort time; and &s;ome banks are
entirely exhau&s;ted. The following year, how|ever,
furni&s;hes an equal quantity, and not the
&s;malle&s;t diminution appears. It is even doubted,
whether a natural bed of oy&s;ters was ever en|tirely
exhau&s;ted. 2. The &s;ub&s;tance of &s;hells is
analogous to that of &s;tone; they are long pre|&s;erved
when immer&s;ed in &s;oft matter; and they
ea&s;ily petrify when connected with matter natu|rally
hard; the&s;e fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, therefore, and other
productions of the &s;ea found on land, being the
&s;poils of many ages, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have accu|mulated
into large ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="230">
We have already remarked the prodigious
quantities of &s;hells pre&s;erved in marble, lime|&s;tone,
chalk, marle, &amp;c.; that they appear in
ma&s;&s;es like hills or mountains; and that they
often compo&s;e more than one half of the bodies
in which they are contained. Sometimes they
appear entire, and at other times in fragments,
but large enough to enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h their
re&s;pective &s;pecies. Here our knowledge of this
&s;ubject, derived from ob&s;ervation, &s;tops. But I
go farther, and maintain, that &s;hells are the me|dium
employed by nature in the formation of
mo&s;t &s;tones; that chalk, marle, and lime-&s;tone,
con&s;i&s;t entirely of the du&s;t or fragments of &s;hells;
and, con&s;equently, that the quantity of decom|po&s;ed
&s;hells is infinitely greater than that of
tho&s;e which have been pre&s;erved. The&s;e po&s;i|tions
&s;hall be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;ection up|on
minerals; and I &s;hall only here exhibit the
point of view in which the different &s;trata of
the earth ought to be con&s;idered. The fir&s;t bed,
in which nothing of the original &s;tructure ap|pears,
is compo&s;ed of mud depo&s;ited by dews,
rains, and &s;now, and of particules of animal and
vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. The inferior beds of
chalk, marle, lime-&s;tone, and marble, are com|po&s;ed
of the &s;poils of &s;hells and other &s;ea-bo|dies,
mixed occa&s;ionally with entire-&s;hells or
fragments of them. But clay and vitrifiable
&s;and are the materials compo&s;ing the internal
parts of the globe. The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances were vitrified
<PB N="196" REF="231">
at the time the earth a&s;&s;umed its figure, which
nece&s;&s;arily implies, that the whole was then in
a melted &s;tate. The different &s;pecies of granite,
flint, free-&s;tone in large ma&s;&s;es, &s;late, and coal,
derive their origin from &s;and and clay; and
are al&s;o di&s;po&s;ed in beds. But tufa and pumice,
free-&s;tone and flint in &s;mall or detached pieces,
cry&s;tals, metals, pyrites, mo&s;t minerals, &s;ulphurs,
&amp;c. are matters, the formation of which is re|cent,
when compared with that of marble, cal|cinable
&s;tones, chalk, marle, and other &s;ub|&s;tances
which are di&s;po&s;ed in horizontal beds,
and contain &s;hells, or other relicts of the
ocean.</P>
<P>As the terms I have employed may appear
ob&s;cure or ambiguous, it is nece&s;&s;ary to explain
them. By <HI>clays,</HI> I mean not only the white and
yellow clays, but likewi&s;e the blue, the &s;oft, the
hard, the laminated, &amp;c. which I con&s;ider to be
the &s;coriac of gla&s;s, or the decompo&s;itions of
gla&s;s. By <HI>&s;and,</HI> I always under&s;tand vitrifiable
&s;and; and I comprehend, under this denomina|tion,
not only the &s;ine &s;and which produces free|&s;tone,
and which I maintain to be the powder
of gla&s;s, or rather of tufa, but al&s;o that &s;and rub|bed
off free-&s;tone, and the &s;till gro&s;&s;er kind re|&s;embling
&s;mall gravel, proceeding from granite
and rock-&s;tone, and which is brittle, angular, and
reddi&s;h, and generally found in the beds of tho&s;e
rivers which de&s;cend precipitantly from hills or
<PB N="197" REF="232">
mountains compo&s;ed of granite or common rock.
The river Arman&s;on, which runs by Sernur in
Auxois, where all the &s;tones are of common
rock, carries down great quantities of this gro&s;s,
rough, and brittle &s;and; it is of the &s;ame nature
with rock-&s;tone, of which it is only &s;mall por|tions,
as calcinable gravels are only particles of
free-&s;tone. Be&s;ides, rock-&s;tone and granite are
the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances; but I have u&s;ed both terms,
becau&s;e they are con&s;idered by &s;ome as different
&s;pecies. The &s;ame may be remarked of flints
and of free-&s;tone in large ma&s;&s;es: The&s;e al&s;o
are &s;pecies of granite; and I call them flints in
large ma&s;&s;es, becau&s;e, like calcinable &s;tones, they
are di&s;po&s;ed in beds, and al&s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h them
from flints and free-&s;tone in &s;mall ma&s;&s;es, as the
round flints and &s;and-&s;tones which have no con|tinuation,
or are not found in beds of any ex|tent.
The&s;e are recent productions, and have
not the &s;ame origin as flint and free-&s;tone in
large ma&s;&s;es, forming regular and exten&s;ive &s;tra|ta.
Under <HI>&s;late</HI> I comprehend the blue, the
white, the gray, the reddi&s;h, and all the plated
&s;tones. The&s;e bodies are generally found be|low
laminated clay, and &s;eem to be nothing el&s;e
but clay hardened into thin &s;trata by drying;
and this is the rea&s;on of the many cracks or fi&s;|&s;ures
remarkable in &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances. Coal and
jet are likewi&s;e referable to clay, and are found
under the laminated clays or &s;late. By <HI>tufa</HI> I
mean not only the common pumice which is
<PB N="198" REF="233">
full of holes, and has an organized appearance,
but all beds of &s;tone formed by the &s;ediments of
running waters, all the &s;talactites, incru&s;tations,
and every kind of &s;tone that di&s;&s;olves by fire.
It does not admit of a doubt that all the&s;e are
new &s;ub&s;tances, and that they are con&s;tantly
growing. Tufa is only a ma&s;s of &s;tony matter,
not di&s;tingui&s;hed by regular &s;trata. This mat|ter
is commonly found in &s;mall hollow cylin|ders,
is regularly &s;haped, formed by rills or drip|pings
at the foot or upon the declivities of hills,
and con&s;i&s;ting of coats of marle or calcareous
earth. The cylindric form is the &s;pecific cha|racter
of this kind of tufa, and it is always ei|ther
oblique or &s;treight, according to the direc|tion
of the rills by which it is produced. The ex|tent
of the&s;e &s;purious quarries is incon&s;iderable,
and generally proportioned to the height of the
mountains which furni&s;h the materials of their
growth. The intervals between the cylinders
of the tufa, by the daily addition of fre&s;h &s;tony
matter, are at la&s;t filled up, and the whole a&s;|&s;umes
a compact and &s;olid form; but it never
acquires the hardne&s;s of &s;tone, and, for that rea|&s;on,
is denominated by Agricola, <HI>marga tofacea
fi&s;tulo&s;a.</HI> In the tufa are often found impre&s;|&s;ions
of the leaves of &s;uch trees and plants as
grow in the neighbourhood; land-&s;hells, well
pre&s;erved, are likewi&s;e frequently found in the
tufa, but never any &s;ea-&s;hells; it is, therefore, a
recent production, and ought to be ranked with
<PB N="199" REF="234">
&s;talactites, incru&s;tations, &amp;c. All the&s;e new
&s;ub&s;tances are a kind of &s;purious &s;tones, formed
by the wa&s;ting of others, but never arrive at the
con&s;i&s;tence of real petrifaction.</P>
<P>Cry&s;tal, precious &s;tones, every &s;tone that has
a regular figure, and even flints in &s;mall ma&s;&s;es
and con&s;i&s;ting of concentric coats, whether
found in the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures of rocks, or
el&s;ewhere, are only exudations, or the concre|ting
juices of flint in large ma&s;&s;es; they are,
therefore, new and &s;purious productions, the
genuine &s;talactites of flint or of granite.</P>
<P>Shells are never found in common rock or
granite, nor in free-&s;tone, although they often
appear in vitrifiable &s;and, from which free-&s;tone
derives its origin. This circum&s;tance &s;eems to
indicate, that &s;and, unle&s;s when perfectly pure,
cannot unite into free-&s;tone or granite; and that
a mixture of &s;hells, or of other heterogeneous
bodies, totally prevents it from cementing. I
have often examined tho&s;e &s;mall round &s;tones,
found in beds of &s;and that are mixed with &s;hells,
and never could di&s;cover in them a &s;ingle &s;hell.
The&s;e round &s;tones are true concretions of free|&s;tone,
formed in tho&s;e places where the &s;and is
pure, and not mixed with heterogeneous mat|ter;
which is the rea&s;on why no larger ma&s;&s;es
are produced.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that, at Am&s;terdam,
which is a very low country, &s;ea-&s;hells were
found 100 feet below the &s;urface, and at Marly|la-Ville,
<PB N="200" REF="235">
6 leagues from Paris, at the depth of
75 feet. They have al&s;o been found in mines
below beds of rock of 50, 100, 200, and even
of 1000 feet thick, as is apparent in the Alps
and Pyernnees, where &s;hells and other &s;ea-bodies
are found in the inferior &s;trata of immen&s;e
rocks, that have been cut through in a perpen|dicular
direction. But to proceed in order:
Shells are found in the mountains of Spain,
France, and England, in all the marble quarries
of Flanders, in the mountains of Gueldres, in
all the hills round Paris, in tho&s;e of Burgundy
and Champagne; in a word, in all places where
the ba&s;is is not compo&s;ed of free-&s;tone or tufa;
and, in all the&s;e places, the &s;ub&s;tance of the
&s;tones con&s;i&s;ts more of &s;hells than of any other
matter. By &s;hells, I mean not only the re|mains
of &s;hell-fi&s;h, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of cru&s;ta|ceous
animals, the bri&s;tles of &s;ea-hedge-hogs, and
all the productions of &s;ea-in&s;ects, as corals, ma|drepores,
a&s;troites, &amp;c. Any man may be con|vinced,
by the evidence of his own eyes, that,
in mo&s;t marbles and calcinable &s;tones, the pro|portion
of &s;ea-bodies is &s;o great, as to exceed the
matter by which they are united.</P>
<P>But, farther, &s;ea-bodies are found even on the
tops of the highe&s;t mountains of the Alps; for
example, on the top of Mount Cenis, in the
mountains of Genes, in the Apennines, and in
mo&s;t of the &s;tone and marble quarries of Italy.
They appear in the &s;tones of which the mo&s;t
<PB N="201" REF="236">
antient buildings in Rome are con&s;tructed, in
the mountains of Tirol, in the centre of Italy,
on the top of Mount Paterne near Boulogne, in
the hills of Pouille, in tho&s;e of Calabria, in many
parts of Germany and of Hungary, and, la&s;tly,
in all the high grounds of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno, Ray, Woodward, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In A&s;ia and Africa, travellers have remarked
&s;everal places, for example, 'upon the Ca&s;tra|van
mountains, above Barute,' &s;ays Shaw<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</NOTE>,
'where there is a curious bed of whiti&s;h &s;tone,
but of the &s;late-kind, which contains, in every
fleak of it, a great number and variety of fi&s;h|es.
The&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, lie exceedingly
flat and compre&s;&s;ed, like the fo&s;&s;il fern plants;
yet, at the &s;ame time, they are &s;o well pre|&s;erved,
that the &s;malle&s;t &s;trokes and lineaments
of their fins, &s;cales, and other &s;uperficial di|ver&s;ities,
are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed.' Between
Cairo and Suez, and particularly upon all the
hills of Barbary, &s;ays the &s;ame author, are many
petrified &s;hells and echini; mo&s;t of them exactly
corre&s;pond with the different &s;pecies &s;till exi&s;t|ing
in the Red Sea. As to Europe, petri&s;ied
fi&s;hes are to be met with in Switzerland, Ger|many,
the quarry of Oningen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, &s;ays M. Bourguet, are to be
found in the long chain of mountains &s;tretch|ing
from Portugal to the mo&s;t ea&s;terly parts of
China, in the valleys of Europe, and in all the
<PB N="202" REF="237">
mountains of Africa and America; and hence,
he remarks, we may conclude, that they al&s;o
exi&s;t in tho&s;e parts of the globe with which we
are &s;till unacquainted.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of Europe, of A&s;ia, and of Ame|rica,
wherever men have had occa&s;ion to dig,
whether in the mountains or in the vallies,
furni&s;h many examples of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells; and

<P>The&s;e facts are &s;ufficient to prove, that fo&s;&s;il
&s;hells, petrified fi&s;hes, and other productions of
the ocean, exi&s;t in great quantities in almo&s;t
every place where proper inve&s;tigations have
been made. 'It is true,' &s;ays Tancrid Robin|&s;on,
'that &s;ea-&s;hells are di&s;per&s;ed occa&s;ionally
on the earth by armies, and by the inhabitants
of towns and villages. La Loubere relates, in
his voyage to Siam, that the monkeys of the
Cape of Good Hope perpetually amu&s;e them|&s;elves
in tran&s;porting &s;hells from the &s;hores of
the &s;ea to the tops of the mountains. But this
is no &s;olution to the que&s;tion, why the&s;e &s;hells
are di&s;per&s;ed through every climate of the
earth, or why they are found in the bowels of
the highe&s;t mountains, and di&s;po&s;ed in beds,
like tho&s;e in the bottom of the ocean.'</P>
<P>Upon peru&s;ing an Italian letter, printed at
Paris in the year 1746, concerning the changes
<PB N="203" REF="238">
this globe has undergone, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to
find a repetition of Loubere's &s;entiments. Pe|trified
fi&s;hes, in the opinion of this writer, are
always of rare &s;pecies, which were rejected from
the Roman tables, becau&s;e they were not e|&s;teemed
to be whole&s;ome: And as to fo&s;&s;il
&s;hells, he &s;ays, that the pilgrims brought
from Syria, in the time of the cru&s;ades, tho&s;e
&s;hells peculiar to the Levant, which are now
found petrified in France, in Italy, and in other
parts of Chri&s;tendom. Why did he not add,
that the monkeys tran&s;ported &s;hells to the tops
of the highe&s;t mountains, which never were
inhabited by men? This he might have done
with great facility, and it would have given an
air of credibility to his hypothe&s;is! How &s;hould
men, who pretend to philo&s;ophy, differ &s;o wide|ly
in their opinions? It is not &s;ufficient, it
would appear, to find fo&s;&s;il &s;hells in almo&s;t
every part of the earth where pits have been
dug, nor to have quoted the te&s;timonies of na|tural
hi&s;torians, as they may, according to cer|tain
&s;y&s;tems, have imagined that &s;hells exi&s;t|ed
where none were to be found: We &s;hall,
therefore, to prevent all prejudices of this kind,
quote the authority of &s;ome authors who had
no theory to &s;upport, and who&s;e habits of ob|&s;ervation
could only enable them to recogni&s;e
&s;hells that were entire, and in the be&s;t pre&s;erva|tion.
This te&s;timony will, perhaps, have great|er
authority with men who cannot judge of the
<PB N="204" REF="239">
facts, nor know the di&s;tinction between real
&s;hells and their petrifactions.</P>
<P>Every man may examine with his eyes the
banks of &s;hells in the hills round Paris, and e|&s;pecially
in the &s;tone-quarries, as at Chau&s;&s;&eacute;e
near Seve, at I&s;ly, Pa&s;&s;y, and other places. A
great quantity of lenticular &s;tones are to be
found at Villers-cotterets; the rocks are almo&s;t
entirely compo&s;ed of them; and they are irre|gularly
inter&s;per&s;ed with a kind of cement, by
which they are united. At Chaumont, the
quantity of &s;hells is &s;o great, that the whole
hills, which are pretty high, appear to con&s;i&s;t of
nothing el&s;e. The &s;ame phaenomenon is exhi|bited
at Courtagnon near Rheims, where there
is a bank of &s;hells of about four leagues broad,
and the length is &s;till more con&s;iderable. I
mention the&s;e places, becau&s;e they are famous,
and the &s;hells &s;trike the eyes of every beholder.</P>
<P>With regard to foreign countries, let us at|tend
to the remarks of travellers.</P>
<P>'In Syria and Phoenicia, in the neighbour|hood
particularly of Latikea, the rocks are of
a hard chalky &s;ub&s;tance, from whence the ad|jacent
city might borrow the name of the
<HI>White Promontory.</HI> The Nakoura, formerly
called the <HI>Scala Tyriorum,</HI> is of the &s;ame na|ture
and complexion; both of them including
a great variety of corals, &s;hells, and other re|mains
of the deluge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels, p. 344.</NOTE>.'</P>

'But fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, and other the like te&s;timo|nies
of the deluge, are very rare in the moun|tains
near Sinai, the original men&s;truum, per|haps,
of the&s;e marbles being too corro&s;ive to
pre&s;erve them. Yet, at Corondel, where the
rocks approach nearer to our free-&s;tone, I
found a few chamae and pectunculi, and a cu|rious
echinus of the di&s;coid kind. The ruins
of the &s;mall village at Ain-el-Mou&s;a, and the
&s;everal conveyances we have there for water,
are all of them full of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells. The old
walls of Suez, and the remains that are left us
of its harbour, are likewi&s;e of the &s;ame ma|terials,
all of them probably from the &s;ame
quarry. Between Suez and Cairo, likewi&s;e,
and all over the mountains of Lybia, near
Egypt, every little ri&s;ing ground and hillock
di&s;covers great quantities of the echini, as well
as of the bivalve and turbinated &s;hells, mo&s;t of
which exactly corre&s;pond with their re&s;pective
families &s;till pre&s;erved in the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels, p. 444.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The moving &s;and in the neighbourhood of

palm-trees, echini, and other petrifactions. <HI>Raz
Seme</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>the head of a fi&s;h,</HI> and is the name
of what is called the petrified village, where it
has been alledged, that men and women, with
their children, cattle, furniture, &amp;c. may be &s;een

'all this is mere fiction, as I learned not only
<PB N="206" REF="241">
from Mr Mair, Con&s;ul at Tripoli, who &s;ent &s;e|veral
people to examine into the fact, but al&s;o
from men of credit and learning who had been
on the &s;pot.'</P>
<P>Near the Pyramids Mr Shaw di&s;covered &s;ome
&s;tones that had been hewn by workmen, and
were mixed with little round bodies like lentils,
and &s;ome of them re&s;embled barley half peeled.
'The&s;e,' he &s;ays, 'were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been
fragments of victuals left by the workmen, and
are now petrified. But this account appears
to be very improbable,' &amp;c. The&s;e lentils and
grains of barley are nothing but petrified &s;hells,
known to every naturali&s;t by the name of lentil|&s;tones.</P>
<P>'Many fo&s;&s;il &s;tones,' &s;ays Mi&s;&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Mi&s;&s;on, tom. 3. p. 109.</NOTE>, 'are

<P>'In the environs of &s;ienne, near Certaldo,
are many mountains of &s;and filled with diffe|rent
kinds of &s;hells. Monte-mario, about a
mile from Rome, is al&s;o full of them. I have
remarked them in the Alps, in France, and in
other places. Olearius, Steno, Cambden, Speed,
and many other writers, have related the

<P>'Oppo&s;ite to Inchen&eacute;, a village on the

<P>'In going from Smyrna to Tauris,' &s;ays Ta|vernier,
'when we came to Tocat, the heat was
exce&s;&s;ive; we therefore left the common road
to the north of us, and went by the mountains,
where there are always &s;hade and cool breezes.
In many places we found &s;now; and, upon the
tops of &s;ome of the&s;e mountains, we &s;aw &s;hells
re&s;embling tho&s;e upon the &s;ea-&s;hore, which is
an extraordinary phaenomenon.'</P>
<P>Let us attend to what Olearius &s;ays concern|ing
the petrified &s;hells he ob&s;erved in Per&s;ia, and
in the rocks where the &s;epulchres have been
cut near the village Pyrmaraus.</P>
<P>'Three of us a&s;cended, by mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting
each other, the mo&s;t frightful precipices, and
at la&s;t gained the &s;ummit, where we found
four large chambers, with &s;everal niches cut
out of the &s;olid rock: But what &s;truck us mo&s;t
was, to find in this vault, on the top of the
<PB N="209" REF="244">
mountain, mu&s;cle-&s;hells; and in &s;ome parts
they appeared in &s;uch quantities, that this
whole rock &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t of nothing but
&s;and and &s;hells. In returning from Per&s;ia,
we perceived &s;everal of the&s;e &s;helly mountains
upon the coa&s;ts of the Ca&s;pian Sea.'</P>
<P>To the&s;e authorities many others might be
added, were I not apprehen&s;ive of tiring tho&s;e
who need no additional proofs on this &s;ubject,
and who have perceived with their eyes, as I
have done, the exi&s;tence of &s;hells in all places
where they have been &s;earched for.</P>
<P>In France, we find not only the &s;hells belong|ing
to our own coa&s;ts, but tho&s;e which never
appeared in our &s;eas. Some philo&s;ophers even
alledge, that the number of foreign petrified
&s;hells greatly exceeds tho&s;e of our own climate.
But this opinion &s;eems not to be well founded;
for, independent of &s;uch &s;hells as lie in the bot|tom
of deep water, and are &s;eldom brought up
by fi&s;hers, and, of cour&s;e, are regarded by us as
foreigners, though they may exi&s;t in our &s;eas, I
find, upon compari&s;on, that more of the petrified
&s;hells belong to our own &s;hores than to any
other. For example, all the pectines, mo&s;t
cockles, mu&s;cles, oi&s;ters, trumpet-&s;hells, ear|&s;hells,
limpets, nautili, &s;tars, tubulites, corals,
madrepores, &amp;c. which are found &s;o univer&s;ally,
are really produced in our &s;eas: And, though
many &s;ea-bodies appear, which are either foreign
or unknown, as the cornu ammonis, the lapi|des
<PB N="210" REF="245">
Judaici, the large &s;crew, the buccinum cal|led
<HI>abajour,</HI> &amp;c. yet I am convinced, by repeat|ed
ob&s;ervation, that the number of the&s;e &s;pe|cies
is incon&s;iderable, when compared with the
&s;hells which belong to our own coa&s;ts. Be&s;ide,
the madrepores, a&s;troites, and all tho&s;e &s;ea-bodies
formed by in&s;ects, con&s;titute the ba&s;is of our
marbles and lime-&s;tone; for the &s;hells, however
abundant, make but a &s;mall part of the&s;e &s;tones,
and many of them are produced in our own
&s;eas, and particularly in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The Red Sea produces corals, madrepores,
and &s;ea-plants, more abundantly than any other.
The port of Tor furni&s;hes an amazing quantity;
in calm weather, the quantity exhibited is &s;o
great, that the bottom of the &s;ea re&s;embles a
fore&s;t: Some of the branched madrepores ri&s;e
from eight to ten feet high. They are al&s;o
very common in the different parts of the Me|diterranean;
and are to be found in all gulfs,
i&s;lands, &amp;c. of every temperate climate, where
the &s;ea is not very deep.</P>
<P>Mr Pey&s;&s;onel was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered
that coral, madrepores, &amp;c. were not plants, but
that they derived their origin from animals.
The truth of this di&s;covery was long doubted:
Some naturali&s;ts at fir&s;t rejected it with di&s;|drain.
But it &s;oon gained univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent; and
every man is now &s;atisfied, that what was for|merly
called &s;ea-plants, are nothing but hives,
or rather lodges, formed by in&s;ects for their own
<PB N="211" REF="246">
habitation. The&s;e bodies were originally cla&s;&s;ed
with minerals, then with plants, and now they
mu&s;t for ever be recogni&s;ed as the genuine ope|ration
of animals.</P>
<P>Many &s;hell fi&s;h inhabit the deepe&s;t parts of
the ocean, and are never thrown upon the coa&s;ts;
authors have, therefore, termed them <HI>Pelagiae,</HI>
to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the other kinds which
they call <HI>Littorales.</HI> It is probable that the cornu
ammonis, and &s;ome other &s;pecies, found only in
a petrified &s;tate, belong to the former, and that
they have been impregnated with &s;tony matter
in the very places where they are di&s;covered. It
is al&s;o probable, that the &s;pecies of &s;ome animals
have been extingui&s;hed, and that the&s;e &s;hells
may be ranked among this number. The ex|traordinary
fo&s;&s;il bones found in Siberia, in Ca|nada,
in Ireland, and &s;everal other places, &s;eem
to confirm this conjecture; for no animal has
hitherto been di&s;covered to whom bones of &s;uch
enormous &s;ize could po&s;&s;ibly belong.</P>
<P>Fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, &s;ays Woodward, are found from
the top to the bottom of quarries, in pits, and in
the deepe&s;t mines of Hungary: And we are in|formed
by Mr Ray, that they are found in the
rocks on the &s;hores of Calda, and in Pembroke|&s;hire,
at the depth of 200 fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ray's di&s;cour&s;es, p. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Shells not only appear in a petrified &s;tate at
great depths, and on the tops of the highe&s;t
mountains, but they are al&s;o found in their na|tural
<PB N="212" REF="247">
condition, having the colour, lu&s;tre, and
lightne&s;s of &s;ea-&s;hells; &s;o that, to be fully &s;atis|fied
on this &s;ubject, nothing farther is requi&s;ite
than to compare them with the &s;hells found on
the &s;hores of the &s;ea. The &s;lighte&s;t examina|tion
will convince us, that petrified and fo&s;&s;il
&s;hells are preci&s;ely the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the
ocean; for they are marked with the &s;ame fur|rows
and articulations, however minute; and,
in the glo&s;&s;opetri and other teeth of fi&s;hes, which
are &s;ometimes found adhering to the jaw-bone,
it is obvious to remark, that the teeth are worn
and poli&s;hed at the extremities, and that they
have been u&s;ed by the living animals.</P>
<P>Fo&s;&s;il &s;hells are almo&s;t every where to be met
with; and, of tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies, &s;ome
are &s;mall, others large, &s;ome young, others old,
&s;ome entire, others imperfect; and &s;ometimes
young ones appear adhering to the old.</P>
<P>The &s;hell-fi&s;h called <HI>Purpura,</HI> has a long
tongue, the extremity of which is &s;o &s;harp and
o&s;&s;eous, that it pierces the &s;hells of other fi&s;hes,
in order to extract nouri&s;hment from them,
Shells pierced in this manner are often found
in the bowels of the earth; which is an incon|te&s;tible
proof that they were formerly inhabited
by living fi&s;hes, and that they exi&s;ted in the &s;ame
places with the purpura<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Woodward, p. 296. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The obeli&s;ks of St Peter's at Rome, accor|ding
to John of Latran, were &s;aid to have been
<PB N="213" REF="248">
brought from the Egyptian pyramids: They
con&s;i&s;t of a red granite, whiche, as formerly re|marked,
contains no &s;hells. But the antient
marbles of Africa and Egypt, and the porphyry
&s;aid to have been brought from Solomon's
temple, and the palaces of the Egyptian kings,
and employed in &s;everal of the Roman buildings,
are full of &s;hells. Red porphyry is compo&s;ed
of an infinite number of the prickles of that
&s;pecies of echinus called a &s;ea-che&s;nut; they
are placed very near each other, and form the
white points of the porphyry. Each of the&s;e
points have a black &s;peck in the middle, which
is the &s;ection of the longitudinal tube of
the prickle of the echinus. At Ficin in Burgun|dy,
three leagues from Dijon, there is a red &s;tone
&s;o &s;imilar to porphyry, that it differs only in
den&s;ity, not being harder than marble: It is en|tirely
compo&s;ed of the points or prickles of the
echini, and the &s;tratum of it is con&s;iderable both
in thickne&s;s and extent. Many excellent pieces
of workman&s;hip are made of it in this province,
and particularly the &s;teps that lead to the pede&s;tal
of the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of Louis le Grand at
Dijon. This &s;pecies of &s;tone is al&s;o found in
Montbard in Burgundy; it is &s;ofter than marble;
but it contains &s;till more prickles of the echini,
and a &s;maller proportion of red matter. Thus
the antient porphyry of Egypt, and the por|phyry
of Burgundy, differ only in the de|gree&punc;
of hardne&s;s, and in the quantity of
<PB N="214" REF="249">
prickles or points of the echinus contained in
them.</P>
<P>With regard to what is called green porphyry,
I imagine it to be rather a granite than a por|phyry.
It is not, like the red porphyry, com|po&s;ed
of the prickles of the echinus; and its
&s;ub&s;tance re&s;embles more that of common gra|nite.
The antient walls of Volatera in Tu&s;cany,
have been built of &s;tones in which are many
&s;hells, and this wall was built 2500 years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno de &s;olido intra &s;olidum, p. 63.</NOTE>.
Mo&s;t marbles, porphyries, and other &s;tones em|ployed
in the buildings of the antients, contain
&s;hells, and other productions of the ocean, in the
&s;ame manner as &s;ome of our modern marbles.
Hence we conclude with &s;afety, that, indepen|dent
of the te&s;timony of holy writ, the earth,
before the deluge, was compo&s;ed of the &s;ame
materials that it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is apparent, that petrified
&s;hells are found in Europe, in A&s;ia, in Africa,
and in every place where proper re&s;earches have
been made. They are al&s;o found in America,
in the Bra&s;ils, for example, in Tucumama, in
Terra Magellanica, and in &s;uch va&s;t quantities in
the Antilles, that what the inhabitants call lime,
which lies immediately below the &s;oil, is nothing
but a congeries of &s;hells, corals, madrepores,
a&s;troites, and other &s;ea-bodies. The&s;e incon|te&s;tible
facts would have led me to conclude,
that petrified &s;hells, and other productions of the
<PB N="215" REF="250">
ocean, were to be found through the whole
continent of America, and e&s;pecially in the moun|tains,
as is affirmed by Woodward. But M. de
la Condamine, who lived &s;everal years in Peru,
a&s;&s;ures me, that he was never able to di&s;cover
any of them in the Cordeliers, although he had
diligently &s;earched for them. This phaeno|menon
would indeed be &s;ingular, and would lead
to conclu&s;ions &s;till more &s;ingular. But, I con|fe&s;s,
the te&s;timony of this celebrated ob&s;erver
notwith&s;tanding, I am &s;trongly inclined to be|lieve
that there is, in the mountains of Peru, as
well as every where el&s;e, petrified &s;hells and other
&s;ea-bodies, although they have not yet been di&s;|covered.
In matters that depend on te&s;timony,
the po&s;itive evidence of two witne&s;&s;es is a com|pleat
proof; but the evidence of ten thou&s;and
witne&s;&s;es, who only declare in the negative, that
they never ob&s;erved a particular appearance, give
ri&s;e to nothing more than a &s;light doubt. Thus
rea&s;on, joined to the force of a general analogy,
obliges me to per&s;i&s;t in believing that fo&s;&s;il &s;hells
will &s;till be found in the mountains of Peru, e|&s;pecially
if they be &s;earched for in the &s;ides, and
not on the very &s;ummits.</P>
<P>The tops of high mountains are generally
compo&s;ed of granite, free-&s;tone, and other vitri|fiable
materials, which never contain &s;hells.
The&s;e matters were all formed out of beds of
&s;and, when they were covered by the &s;ea. But,
when the waters left the mountains, they would
<PB N="216" REF="251">
carry off the &s;and, and other light bodies, into the
plains, and leave nothing on their tops but tho&s;e
beds of rock which had been formed below the
&s;tratum of &s;and. At two, three, or four hun|dred
fathom below the &s;ummit of the&s;e moun|tains,
we often find marbles and other calcinable
matters, di&s;po&s;ed in parallel beds, and contain|ing
&s;hells and other &s;ea-bodies. Hence, if M.
de la Condamine examined only the mo&s;t ele|vated
places, which con&s;i&s;t of granite, of free|&s;tone,
or of vitrifiable &s;and, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing
that he did not find fo&s;&s;il &s;hells. But he ought
to have explored the lower parts of the Corde|liers,
and he would unque&s;tionably have di&s;co|vered
beds of marble, earth, &amp;c. mixed with
&s;hells; for &s;uch beds have been found in every
part of the world that has undergone a proper
examination.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a fact, that there are
no productions of the ocean in the mountains of
Peru, nothing could be concluded from it that
would affect our theory. Some parts of the
globe, and particularly places of &s;uch elevation
as the Cordeliers, might never have been cover|ed
with the &s;ea. The&s;e mountains, however,
would be an ample field for curious ob&s;ervation.
They would not, in that ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;t of parallel
beds. Their materials would be very different
from all others: They would have no perpen|dicular
fi&s;&s;ures: The &s;tructure of the &s;tones and
rocks would have no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of
<PB N="217" REF="252">
other countries: <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The&s;e mountains would
exhibit the antient &s;tructure of the earth before
it was changed by the motion of the waters;
they would di&s;cover the primitive &s;tate of the
globe, its original form, the natural arrangement
and connection of its parts. But this notion is
&s;upported by too &s;lender a foundation; and it is
more con&s;onant to the rules of philo&s;ophy to
believe that fo&s;&s;il &s;hells exi&s;t in the mountains
of Peru, in the &s;ame manner as they exi&s;t every
where el&s;e.</P>
<P>With regard to the po&s;ition of &s;hells in beds
of earth or of &s;tone, let us attend to the follow|ing
pa&s;&s;age of Woodward: 'All the &s;hells that
are found in numberle&s;s &s;trata of earth, and
rocks, in the highe&s;t mountains, and in the
mo&s;t profound quarries and mines, in flint,
cornelian, agate, &amp;c. and in ma&s;&s;es of &s;ulphur,
marca&s;ites, and other mineral and metallic bo|dies,
are filled with the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances that
compo&s;e the &s;trata in which they are included,
and never with any heterogeneous matter;'
p. 206. &amp;c.&mdash;'We now find in the &s;and|&s;tone
of all countries (the &s;pecific gravity of
the &s;everal &s;orts whereof is very little different,
being generally to water as 2&frac12; or 2 9/10 to 1)
only tho&s;e conchae, pectines, cochleae, and
other &s;hells that are nearly of the &s;ame gra|vity,
viz. 2&frac12; or 2 5/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to 1. But the&s;e are ordi|narily
found enclo&s;ed in it in prodigious num|bers;
whereas, of oi&s;ter-&s;hells, (which are in
<PB N="218" REF="253">
gravity but as about 2&frac13; to 1) of echini, (which
are but as 2, or 2&frac18; to 1) or the other lighter
kinds of &s;hells, &s;carce one ever appears therein.
On the contrary, in chalk (which is lighter
than &s;tone, being but as about 2 1/10 to 1) there
are only found echini, and the other lighter
&s;orts of &s;hells;' p. 32. 33.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t here be remarked, that what Wood|ward
&s;ays with re&s;pect to &s;pecific gravity, is not
univer&s;ally true; for &s;hells of different &s;pecific
gravities are often found in the &s;ame matters;
&s;hells of cockles, of oi&s;ters, and of echini, for
example, are found in the &s;ame bed of &s;tones or
of earth. In the cabinet of the French King,
there is a cockle petrified in a cornelian, and
echini petrified in an agate. Hence the difference
in the &s;pecific gravity of &s;hells has had le&s;s in|fluence
upon their po&s;ition in the &s;trata of the
earth than Woodward would have us to believe.
The rea&s;on why the &s;hells of the echini, and
others of a light texture, abound &s;o much in
chalk, is owing to this circum&s;tance, that chalk
it&s;elf is only decompo&s;ed &s;hells; tho&s;e of the
echini being lighter and thinner than others,
would be mo&s;t ea&s;ily reduced to powder or
chalk; and hence beds of chalk could only exi&s;t
in tho&s;e places where were formerly collected
by the &s;ea great quantities of light &s;hells, the de|&s;truction
of which would form that chalk in
which we &s;till find &s;hells that have re&s;i&s;ted the
<PB N="219" REF="254">
operation of time, either in an entire &s;tate, or in
fragments &s;ufficient to di&s;cover their &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject &s;hall be treated more fully in the
article of Minerals; I &s;hall here only ob&s;erve,
that Woodward's expre&s;&s;ions are often too ge|neral.
He appears to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;hells are
found as frequently, and in as great abundance,
in flints, cornelians, calcedonii, ores, and &s;ul|phur,
as in other matters. But the fact is, that
&s;hells are a very rare phaenomenon in vitrifiable
or purely inflammable &s;ub&s;tances; and, in chalk,
marle, and marbles, the quantity of them is &s;o
prodigious, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to affirm that the
lighter and heavier &s;hells are uniformly found in
&s;trata corre&s;ponding to their &s;pecific gravities,
though, in general, this may be the ca&s;e oftener
than otherwi&s;e. They are all impregnated with
the bodies in which they are immer&s;ed, whe|ther
in the horizontal beds, or in the perpendi|cular
fi&s;&s;ures, becau&s;e the whole has been effec|ted
by the operation of water, though at differ|ent
times and in different manners. Tho&s;e found
in the horizontal beds of &s;tone, marble, &amp;c.
have been tran&s;ported and depo&s;ited by the
waves of the &s;ea; and tho&s;e found in flints,
cornelians, and other &s;ub&s;tances peculiar to the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, were formed by rills of
water impregnated with lapidific or metallic
&s;ub&s;tances. In both ca&s;es, the matter that fills
the &s;hells has been in the &s;tate of a fine impal|pable
<PB N="220" REF="255">
powder; becau&s;e every pore of them is
compleatly filled, and the moulds of them are as
exact as the impre&s;&s;ions of a &s;eal upon wax.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that, in &s;tone, marble,
&amp;c. there are multitudes of &s;hells &s;o entire, and
&s;o well pre&s;erved, that they may be compared
with tho&s;e in our cabinets, or upon the &s;hores of
the &s;ea.</P>
<P>'There being, I &s;ay, be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;uch va&s;t
multitudes of &s;hells contained in &s;tone, &amp;c.
which are entire, fair, and ab&s;olutely free from
any &s;uch mineral contagion; which are to be
matched by others at this day found upon our
&s;hores, and which do not differ in any re&s;pect
from them; being of the &s;ame &s;ize that tho&s;e
are of, and the &s;ame &s;hape preci&s;ely; of the
&s;ame &s;ub&s;tance and texture, as con&s;i&s;ting of the
&s;ame peculiar matter, and this con&s;tituted and
di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as is that of their
re&s;pective fellow-kinds at &s;ea; the tendency
of the fibres and &s;triae the &s;ame; the compo|&s;ition
of the lamellae, con&s;tituted by the&s;e
fibres, alike in both; the &s;ame ve&s;tigia of ten|dons
(by means whereof the animal is fa&s;ten|ed
and joined to the &s;hell) in each; the &s;ame
papillae; the &s;ame futures, and every thing
el&s;e, whether within or without the &s;hell, in
its cavity, or upon its convexity, in the &s;ub|&s;tance,
or upon the &s;urface of it. Be&s;ides,

accidents of the marine ones, ex. gr. they
&s;ometimes grow to one another, the le&s;&s;er &s;hells
being fixed to the larger: They have balani, tu|buli

growing upon them. And, which is very
con&s;iderable, they are mo&s;t exactly of the &s;ame
&s;pecific gravity with their fellow-kinds now
upon the &s;hores. Nay farther, they an&s;wer
all chymical trials in like manner as the &s;ea|&s;hells
do; their parts, when di&s;&s;olved, have
the &s;ame appearance to view, the &s;ame &s;mell
and ta&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Woodward, p. 23. 24.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erved, with a&s;toni&s;hment,
whole mountains, chains of rocks, and exten&s;ive
quarries, &s;o full of &s;hells, and other &s;ea-bodies,
that there was hardly &s;pace left for the matters
in which they are depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome arable fields &s;o full of pe|trified
cockles, that they might be picked up by
a blind man, others entirely covered with cornu
ammonis, and others with cardites; and the more
this &s;ubject is inquired into, we &s;hall be the more
thoroughly convinced, that the number of pe|trifactions
is infinite, and that it was ab&s;olutely
impo&s;&s;ible that all the animals which inhabited
the&s;e &s;hells could exi&s;t at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I have farther remarked, that the &s;tones of
tho&s;e arable lands which abound with petrified
&s;hells in an entire form, well pre&s;erved, and de|tached
from all other matter, are frittered down
<PB N="222" REF="257">
by fro&s;t, which de&s;troys &s;tones, but has little ef|fect
upon petrified &s;hells.</P>
<P>The&s;e immen&s;e quantities of petrified &s;ea|bodies,
found in &s;o many different places and &s;i|tuations,
prove, that they could not be tran&s;port|ed
and depo&s;ited by the waters of the deluge;
for the greate&s;t part of them, in&s;tead of being
found in the bowels of the earth, and in &s;olid
marble at the depth of &s;even or eight hundred
feet, behoved to have remained on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>In all quarries, petrified &s;hells form part of
the internal &s;tructure of the &s;tone, the &s;urface
of which is often covered with &s;talactites, a
matter much le&s;s antient than the &s;tone that
contains the &s;hells. Another proof that the&s;e
&s;hells could not be derived from the deluge is,
that the bones, horns, claws, &amp;c. of land-ani|mals
are &s;eldom found in a petrified &s;tate, and
are never incorporated in marble, or other hard
&s;tones; whereas, if the&s;e effects had been pro|duced
by the deluge, the remains of land-ani|mals
would have been found in marbles, as well
as tho&s;e of fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>To alledge, that the earth was entirely di&s;&s;ol|ved
at the time of the deluge, is a mere gratui|tous
&s;upp&s;ition, which required a &s;econd miracle
in order to give water the power of an univer|&s;al
di&s;&s;olvent. Be&s;ides, it infers an evident con|tradiction;
for, if water was then an univer&s;al
men&s;truum, how could &s;hells have been pre|&s;erved
in the entire &s;tate in which we find them?
<PB N="223" REF="258">
This is an evident demon&s;tration, that no &s;uch
di&s;&s;olution took place, and that the parallel &s;trata
were not formed in an in&s;tant, but were gradu|ally
produced by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ediments; for, it is
apparent to every ob&s;erver, that the di&s;po&s;ition
of all the materials compo&s;ing the earth has been
occa&s;ioned by the operation of water. The on|ly
que&s;tion, therefore, that remains, is, whether
this arrangement of parts was produced all at
once, or in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time? Now, it has
already been &s;hown, that it could not po&s;&s;ibly
happen at one time; becau&s;e the materials are
not di&s;po&s;ed according to their &s;pecific gravities,
and becau&s;e they never &s;uffered a general di&s;&s;o|lution.
This arrangement, therefore, mu&s;t have
originated from &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ediments. Any other
cau&s;e, or particular revolution, would have gi|ven
ri&s;e to an arrangement totally different. Be|&s;ides,
particular revolutions, or accidental cau&s;es,
could never have produced a uniform di&s;po&s;i|tion
of horizontal and parallel &s;trata throughout
the whole globe.</P>
<P>Let us attend to what the hi&s;torian of the
Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann&eacute;e 1718, p. 3.</NOTE> has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>'The many marks of exten&s;ive inundations,
and the manner in which mountains mu&s;t be
conceived to have been produced, demon&s;trate,
that the &s;urface of this earth has &s;uffered great
revolutions. However deep we penetrate in|to
<PB N="224" REF="259">
to the globe, we di&s;cover nothing but ruins,
bodies of different kinds ama&s;&s;ed and incor|porated
without any order or apparent de&s;ign.
If there be any regularity in the &s;tructure of
the earth, it lies too deep for our re&s;earches;
we mu&s;t, therefore, confine our&s;elves to the
ruins of the external cru&s;t, which will be &s;uf|ficent
to occupy the attention of philo&s;ophers.'</P>
<P>'M. de Ju&s;&s;ieu di&s;covered, in the neighbour|hood
of St Chaumont, a great quantity of
&s;laty or laminated &s;tones, every lamina of
which was marked with the impre&s;&s;ion of a
&s;tem, leaf, or other portion of &s;ome plant. In
the impre&s;&s;ions of leaves, they were uniform|ly
extended, as if they had been &s;treached in
the &s;tones by the hand; a clear demon&s;tration
that they had been tran&s;ported by water,
which always keeps leaves in that po&s;ition:
Their &s;ituations were various, and &s;ometimes
they lay acro&s;s each other.'</P>
<P>'It is natural to imagine, that a leaf depo&s;i|ted
by water upon &s;oft mud, and then cover|ed
by a &s;imilar layer of mud, would impre&s;s
upon the lowermo&s;t layer the figure of its one
&s;ide, and upon the uppermo&s;t the figure of its
oppo&s;ite &s;ide; and, after the&s;e layers hardened
and petrified, that they would each bear an
impre&s;&s;ion of a different &s;ide of the leaf. But
this &s;uppo&s;ition, however natural, does not
take place: The two laminae of &s;tone uni|formly
<PB N="225" REF="260">
formly bear the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;ide
of the leaf, the one in alto, the other in ba&s;s|relief.
For this ob&s;ervation, with regard to
the figured &s;tones of St Chaumont, we are in|debted
to M. de Ju&s;&s;ieu; but we leave the ex|plication
of it to him&s;elf, and &s;hall proceed to
remarks of a more general and intere&s;ting na|ture.'</P>
<P>'All the impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;tones of Saint
Chaumont are of foreign plants, which are
not to be found in any part of France; they
are natives either of the Ea&s;t Indies, or of the
warmer climates of America. Mo&s;t of them
belong to the capillary tribes, and they are ge|nerally
particular &s;pecies of ferns, the clo&s;e
texture of which enables them both to make
deep impre&s;&s;ions, and to remain long in a &s;tate
of pre&s;ervation. M. Leibnitz was a&s;toni&s;hed
to find the impre&s;&s;ions of the leaves of a few
Ea&s;t India plants upon &s;ome &s;tones in Ger|many:
In the example under con&s;ideration,
the wonder is greatly augmented; for, by
&s;ome unaccountable de&s;tination of nature, it
would appear, in all the &s;tones of Saint Chau|mont,
not a &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ion of a native plant
is to be found.'</P>
<P>'From the number of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells in the
mountains and quarries exhibited in this coun|try,
as well as in many others, it is apparent,
that it mu&s;t have formerly been covered with
<PB N="226" REF="261">
the &s;ea. But how could the American or In|dian
oceans come hither?'</P>
<P>'To &s;olve this and other &s;urpri&s;ing phaeno|mena,
we may &s;uppo&s;e, with much probabi|lity,
that the &s;ea originally covered the whole
globe. But this &s;uppo&s;ition will not an&s;wer;
becau&s;e no terre&s;trial plants could then exi&s;t:
The plants of one country, therefore, could
only be tran&s;ported to another by great inun|dations.'</P>
<P>'M. de Ju&s;&s;ieu imagines, that, as the bed of
the &s;ea is always ri&s;ing higher by means of the
mud and &s;and ince&s;&s;antly carried into it by the
rivers, the &s;ea, at fir&s;t confined by natural dikes,
might at la&s;t &s;urmount them, and &s;pread over
the land to great di&s;tances; or, which would
produce the &s;ame effect, the dikes might in
time be rendered &s;o thin, by the con&s;tant ope|ration
of the water, that they would at la&s;t
give way. Soon after the formation of the
earth, when nothing had a&s;&s;umed a regular
or &s;ettled form, &s;udden and prodigious revo|lutions
might then be produced, of which we
have now no examples, becau&s;e every thing
is in &s;uch a fixed and permanent &s;tate, that
only &s;low and incon&s;iderable changes can take
place: It is for this rea&s;on that we find a dif|ficulty
in crediting revolutions more &s;udden
and tremendous.'</P>
<P>'By &s;ome of the&s;e great revolutions the We&s;t
<PB N="227" REF="262">
or Ea&s;t Indian Oceans might have been poured
in upon Europe: In their journey, they would
tear up foreign plants, carry them off floating
on the waves, and gently depo&s;ite them in
&s;hallow places, from which the waters would
&s;oon evaporate.'</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Inequalities upon the Earth's Surface.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the inequalities upon the &s;urface
of the earth may be con&s;idered as a defor|mity
in its figure, they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
vegetation and animal life. To be convinced of
this, we need only con&s;ider what would be
the condition of the earth, were its &s;urface per|fectly
&s;mooth and regular. In&s;tead of tho&s;e
beautiful hills which furni&s;h abundance of wa|ter
for &s;upporting the verdure of the earth, in|&s;tead
of tho&s;e richly garni&s;hed fields, where
plants and animals find an ea&s;y and comforta|ble
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, a dreary ocean would cover the
whole globe, and the earth, deprived of all its
<PB N="229" REF="264">
valuable and alluring qualities, would be an
ob&s;cure, abandoned planet, &s;uited only for the
habitation of fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But, independent of moral con&s;iderations,
which &s;eldom ought to be employed in natural
philo&s;ophy, the &s;urface mu&s;t, from a phy&s;ical
nece&s;&s;ity, have been irregular; for, &s;uppo&s;ing it
to have been originally &s;mooth and level, the
motion of the waters, &s;ubterraneous fires, the
winds, and other external cau&s;es, would nece&s;|&s;arily
produce, in time, irregularities &s;imilar to
tho&s;e which we now behold.</P>
<P>Next to the elevation of mountains, the depths
of the ocean form the greate&s;t inequalities. This
depth is exceedingly diver&s;ified, even at great
di&s;tances from land. In &s;ome places the &s;ea is
&s;aid to be a league in depth; but that is a rare
phaenomenon; and the mo&s;t common depths
are from 60 to 150 fathoms. Gulfs and branches
of the ocean that run in upon the land, are &s;till
le&s;s deep; and &s;traits are generally the mo&s;t
&s;hallow places.</P>
<P>Depths are commonly &s;ounded by a piece of
lead, 30 or 40 pounds weight, fixed to a &s;mall
rope. This method an&s;wers well enough for or|dinary
depths, but is liable to error when the
depth is very great; for the cord being &s;pecifi|cally
lighter than water, after much of it has
been wound down, the weight of the lead and
that of the cord become nearly equal to their
bulks of water; then the lead de&s;cends no more,
<PB N="230" REF="265">
but runs off in an oblique line, and floats at the
&s;ame depth. Hence, in &s;ounding great depths,
an iron chain, or &s;ome body heavier than water,
&s;hould be employed. It is for want of atten|tion
to this circum&s;tance, that &s;ome navigators
have been led to maintain, that the &s;ea, in ma|ny
places, has no bottom.</P>
<P>In general, the depths in open &s;eas augment
or dimini&s;h in a pretty regular manner, being
commonly deeper the farther from land. But
to this remark there are many exceptions; for
there are places in the middle of the &s;ea, as at
the <HI>Abrolhos</HI> in the Atlantic, where large &s;helves
appear; and there are, in other places, va&s;t
&s;and-banks, well known to the mariners who &s;ail
to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Along coa&s;ts, the depths are likewi&s;e very irre|gular.
However, it may be laid down as a cer|tain
rule, that the depth is always proportioned
to the height of the coa&s;t: The &s;ame ob&s;ervation
applies to rivers.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to mea&s;ure the height of mountains,
either geometrically or by the barometer. This
in&s;trument determines the height of a mountain
pretty exactly, e&s;pecially in countries where its
variation is not con&s;iderable, as at Peru and o|ther
equatorial climates. By one or other of
the&s;e methods, the height of mo&s;t mountains has
already been a&s;certained; for example, it has
been found, that the highe&s;t mountains of Swit|zerland
exceed Canigau, the mo&s;t elevated of
<PB N="231" REF="266">
the Pyrennees, 1600 fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. 1708, p. 24.</NOTE>. The&s;e moun|tains
appear to be the highe&s;t in Europe, &s;ince
they give ri&s;e to a great number of rivers which
run into different and very di&s;tant &s;eas, as the
Po, which empties it&s;elf in the Adriatic, the
Rhine, which lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ands of Hol|land,
the Rhone, which falls into the Mediter|ranean,
and the Danube, which runs into the
Black Sea. The&s;e four rivers, the mouths of
which are &s;o di&s;tant, derive part of their waters
from Saint Godard and the neighbouring moun|tains;
a clear proof that this place is the mo&s;t ele|vated
part of Europe.</P>
<P>Mount Taurus, Imaus, Cauca&s;us, and the
mountains of Japan, are higher than any in Eu|rope.
The mountains of Africa, as the great
Atlas, and the mountains of the Moon, are at
lea&s;t equally high with tho&s;e of A&s;ia; and the
highe&s;t of all are tho&s;e of South America, and
e&s;pecially of Peru, which are 3000 fathoms above
the level of the &s;ea. In general, the tropical
mountains are more elevated than tho&s;e of the
temperate zones, and the latter are higher than
tho&s;e nearer the poles. Thus, the nearer the
Equator, the greater are the &s;uperficial inequali|ties,
which, though con&s;iderable with regard to
us, are nothing when e&s;timated in relation to the
whole globe. A difference of 3000 fathoms in 3000
leagues diameter, is but a fathom to a league, or a
foot to 2200 feet, and, upon a globe of 2&frac12; feet,
<PB N="232" REF="267">
would not make the 16th part of a French line.
Hence this earth, which to us appears to be tra|ver&s;ed
and inter&s;ected by mountains of an enor|mous
height, and by &s;eas of a dreadful depth,
is, in relation to its &s;ize, but &s;lightly furrowed
with inequalities &s;o incon&s;iderable, that they can|not
make any variation upon its general figure.</P>
<P>The mountains, in continents, form continued
chains; but, in i&s;lands, they are more interrupt|ed,
generally ri&s;e in the form of a cone, or py|ramid,
and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of
peaks. The Peak of Teneriffe, in the I&s;land of
Fer, is one of the highe&s;t mountains in the earth;
it is nearly a league and a half perpendicular a|bove
the level of the &s;ea. The Peak of St
George in one of the Azores, and the Peak of
Adam, in the I&s;land of Ceylon, are likewi&s;e ex|ceedingly
high. The&s;e peaks are compo&s;ed of
rocks, piled above each other; and all of them
throw out, from their &s;ummits, fire, a&s;hes, bitu|men,
minerals, and &s;tones. Some i&s;lands, as St
Helena, A&s;cen&s;ion I&s;le, and mo&s;t of the Canaries
and Azores, are only the tops or points of moun|tains.
It is al&s;o worthy of remark, that the
middle of mo&s;t i&s;lands, promontories, and capes,
is the mo&s;t elevated, and that they are generally
divided into two parts, by chains of mountains
which run in the direction of their greate&s;t
length: In Scotland, for example, the Grampian
mountains (Grans-bain) extend from ea&s;t to
we&s;t, and divide the I&s;land of Great Britain into
<PB N="233" REF="268">
two parts: The &s;ame thing takes place in Su|matra,
the Lucca I&s;lands, Borneo, Celebes, Cuba,
St Domingo, the penin&s;ulas of Corea and Ma|laya,
&amp;c. Italy is al&s;o longitudinally traver&s;ed
by the Appennines.</P>
<P>Mountains, as mentioned above, are of differ|ent
heights; the hills are lowe&s;t; then follow
the mountains of an ordinary height, which
are &s;ucceeded by a third range &s;till higher. All
the&s;e are commonly covered with trees and plants;
but neither of them furni&s;h &s;prings excepting at
their bottoms. In the la&s;t and highe&s;t range,
we find nothing but &s;and, loo&s;e &s;tones, flints,
and rocks, the tops of which often reach above
the clouds. Preci&s;ely at the foot of the&s;e rocks,
are little plains, or hollows, which collect rains
and &s;now, and form tho&s;e ponds, mora&s;&s;es, or
fountains, from which the rivers derive their
&s;ources<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettres philo&s;ophiques fur la formation des fels, &amp;c. p. 198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The figure of mountains is likewi&s;e very dif|ferent.
Some con&s;i&s;t of long chains of nearly
an equal height; others are inter&s;ected by deep
vallies; the contours of &s;ome mountains are
pretty uniform; tho&s;e of others are mo&s;t irre|gular,
and &s;ometimes a detached little mountain
appears in the middle of a plain or valley. There
are al&s;o two kinds of plains; &s;ome occupy the
low grounds, and others appear in the moun|tains.
The former are generally divided by
&s;ome large river; but the latter, though their
<PB N="234" REF="269">
extent be con&s;iderable, are dry, or furni&s;hed with
only a &s;mall rill. The plains in the mountains
are often exceedingly high, always of difficult
acce&s;s, and form one country above another, as
in Auvergne, Savoy, and other elevated pro|vinces.
The &s;oil of them is firm, and produces
plenty of herbs and odoriferous plants, which
renders them the fine&s;t pa&s;ture-grounds in the
world.</P>
<P>The tops of high mountains are compo&s;ed of
rocks of different elevations, which, when view|ed
at a di&s;tance, make them re&s;emble the waves
of the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ibid. p. 196.</NOTE>. This is not the only rea&s;on for
our affirming that mountains were formed by
the motions of the &s;ea; I only mention it, be|cau&s;e
it corre&s;ponds with every other phaeno|menon.
But the following facts put this point
beyond all controver&s;y: The fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, and
other &s;ea-bodies, every where found in &s;uch
profu&s;ion, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly be tran&s;|ported
from the &s;ea, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, into
continents &s;o di&s;tant, and depo&s;ited at &s;uch great
depths in the bowels of the mountains: The
univer&s;al paralleli&s;m of the different &s;trata, an
effect which could only be produced by water,
and the compo&s;ition even of the mo&s;t den&s;e of
them, as tho&s;e of &s;tone and marble, which clear|ly
evinces, that, before their formation, they had
been reduced into a fine powder, and precipi|tated
to the bottom in the form of &s;ediments:
<PB N="235" REF="270">
The exactne&s;s with which the fo&s;&s;il &s;hells are
moulded in the matters in which they are found:
The cavities of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, which are uniform|ly
filled with the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances that contain
them: The corre&s;ponding angles of hills and
mountains, which nothing could effect but the
currents of the ocean: The equality in the
heights of oppo&s;ite hills, and the different &s;trata
uniformly appearing at the &s;ame levels: And,
la&s;tly, the direction of mountains, the chains of
which extend longitudinally, like the waves of
the &s;ea.</P>
<P>With regard to the depths or hollows on the
&s;urface of the earth, tho&s;e of the ocean are un|que&s;tionably
the greate&s;t. But, as the&s;e are hid
from human view, and can only be di&s;covered
by &s;ounding, we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e
which appear on the dry land, &s;uch as deep val|lies,
precipices found between rocks, aby&s;&s;es
that pre&s;ent them&s;elves in high mountains, as the
aby&s;s of Mount Ararat, the precipices of the
Alps, the vallies of the Pyrennees, &amp;c. The&s;e
depths are a natural con&s;equence of the elevation
of mountains; they receive the water and earth
carried down from the high grounds; their
&s;oil is generally fertile; and they are full of in|habitants.
The precipices among rocks are of|ten
occa&s;ioned by a &s;udden &s;inking of one &s;ide,
the ba&s;e, which generally inclines more one way
than another, being loo&s;ened by the action
of the air, and of fro&s;t, or by the violence of
<PB N="236" REF="271">
torrents. But aby&s;&s;es, or tho&s;e enormous pre|cipices
that appear on the tops of &s;ome moun|tains,
and, to the bottom of which, though their
circumference be a mile and a half, or three
miles round, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cend, have
been formed by the operation of fire. They
have been the furnaces of antient volcano's, the
matter of which has been exhau&s;ted by explo|&s;ions
and the long action of fires, which are
now extingui&s;hed from the want of combu&s;tible
matter. Of this kind is the aby&s;s of Mount
Ararat, de&s;cribed by Tournefort. It is &s;urround|ed
with rocks that are black and burned. The
aby&s;&s;es of Aetna and of Ve&s;uvius will have the
&s;ame appearance after their inflammable mate|rials
are exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>In Plot's hi&s;tory of the country of Stafford in
England, there is an account of a kind of gulf,
which was &s;ounded by a rop of 2600 feet, with|out
finding either watter or bottom, the rop
being too &s;hort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journal des Savans, 1680, p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t cavities, and the deepe&s;t mines,
are generally in the mountains, and they &s;eldom
de&s;cend to the level of the plains; and we di&s;|cover
by them the internal &s;tructure of the
mountain only, not that of the globe it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the&s;e depths are not very con&s;iderable.
Mr Ray affirms, that the deepe&s;t mines exceed
not half a mile. The mine of Cotteberg, which,
in the time of Agricola, was e&s;teemed to be the
<PB N="237" REF="272">
deepe&s;t in the world, was only 2500 feet of
perpendicular depth. There are, indeed, holes
in particular places, as that mentioned by Plot,
or Pool's hole in the county of Derby, the depth
of which is probably very great: But none of
them bear any &s;en&s;ible proportion to the thick|ne&s;s
of the globe.</P>
<P>If the kings of Egypt, in place of erecting
pyramids as monuments of their vanity and
riches, had expended equal &s;ums in making pro|found
excavations into the bowels of the earth,
to the depth of perhaps a league, they might
have di&s;covered &s;ub&s;tances which would have
recompen&s;ed their labour; they would at lea&s;t
have extended the knowledge of the earth's in|ternal
&s;tructure, which might have been pro|ductive
of much utility.</P>
<P>But, let us return to the mountains. The
highe&s;t of them lie between the tropics; and
the nearer we approach to the equator, the
greater are the inequalities on the earth's &s;ur|face.
A &s;hort enumeration of mountains and
i&s;lands will be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h this point.</P>
<P>In America, the Cordeliers, which are the
highe&s;t mountains in the world, lie preci&s;ely
under the equator, and they extend on both &s;ides
a con&s;iderable way beyond the Tropic circles.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t mountains of the Moon, of Mo|nomotapa,
and the great and little Atlas, in
Africa, lie either under or very near the equa|tor.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="273">
In A&s;ia, Mount Cauca&s;us, the chain of which,
under different names, runs into China, and,
through this whole extent, lies nearer the equa|tor
than the poles.</P>
<P>In Europe, the Pyrennees, the Alps, and the
mountains of Greece, which form one chain,
are &s;till le&s;s di&s;tant from the equator than the
pole.</P>
<P>The&s;e chains of mountains, of which we
have given an enumeration, are higher, and of
greater extent, both in length and in breadth,
than tho&s;e of more northern countries. With
regard to their direction, the Alps form a con|tinued
chain which runs acro&s;s the whole Con|tinent
from Spain to China. They commence
on the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Galicia, join the Pyrennees,
traver&s;e France, by Vivares and Auvergne, run
through Italy, and &s;tretch into Germany, above
Dalmatia, until they reach Macedonia; from
thence they join the mountains of Armenia,
the Cauca&s;us, the Taurus, the Imaus, and at
la&s;t terminate on the coa&s;t of Tartary. Mount
Atlas, in the &s;ame manner, traver&s;es the whole
Continent of Africa, from the kingdom of Fez
to the &s;traits of the Red Sea. The mountains
of the Moon have likewi&s;e the &s;ame direction.</P>
<P>But the mountains of America have an oppo|&s;ite
direction. The va&s;t chains of Cordeliers,
and other mountains, run more from &s;outh to
north than from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="274">
What we have now remarked concerning the
greate&s;t elevations of the land, applies equally to
the greate&s;t depths of the &s;ea. The mo&s;t exten|&s;ive
and deepe&s;t &s;eas lie nearer the equator than
the poles: From the&s;e united ob&s;ervations, the
truth of our general po&s;ition, that the greate&s;t
inequalities of the globe are to be found in the
equatorial regions, is &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed.
The&s;e irregularities on the &s;urface of the earth
give ri&s;e to a number of curious phaenomena.
Between the Indus and the Ganges, for example,
there is a large penin&s;ula, through the middle
of which runs a chain of high mountains, called
the <HI>Gate,</HI> which extends, from north to &s;outh,
from the extremity of Mount Cauca&s;us to Cape
Comorin; one &s;ide of this penin&s;ula forms the
coa&s;t of Malabar, the other that of Coromandel.
On the Malabar &s;ide, between the chain of
mountains and the &s;ea, the &s;ea&s;on of &s;ummer is
from September to April; and, during the&s;e
months, the &s;ky is &s;erene, and no rain falls.
But, on the Coromandel coa&s;t, which lies on the
other &s;ide of the mountains, this very period is
their winter, and the rains fall abundantly.
This rever&s;e of &s;ummer and winter happens in
&s;ome places no farther di&s;tant than 20 leagues;
&s;o that, by cro&s;&s;ing the mountains, a man has it
in his power to change &s;ea&s;ons. The &s;ame thing,
it is &s;aid, takes place at Cape Razalgat in Arabia,
and even in Jamaica, which is divided from ea&s;t
to we&s;t by a chain of mountains; on the &s;outh
<PB N="240" REF="275">
&s;ide of the&s;e mountains, the plantations enjoy
the warmth of &s;ummer, while tho&s;e on the north
&s;uffer all the rigours of winter. Peru, which is
&s;ituated under the line, and extends about 1000
leagues towards the &s;outh, is divided into three
long and narrow portions, called by the inha|bitants
<HI>Lanos, Sierras,</HI> and <HI>Andes.</HI> The Lanos,
which are the plains, extend along the coa&s;t of
the South Sea; the Sierras are hills inter&s;per&s;ed
with vallies; and the Andes are the famous Cor|deliers,
the highe&s;t mountains in the world. The
Lanos are about 10 leagues broad; the Sierras,
in many places, 20 leagues; and the Andes
nearly the &s;ame, though &s;ome parts of them are
more, and others le&s;s broad. The breadth of
the&s;e divi&s;ions is from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and their
length from &s;outh to north. This part of the
world exhibits the following remarkable ap|pearances:
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Along the whole coa&s;t of the
Lanos, a &s;outh-we&s;t wind almo&s;t con&s;tantly
blows, which is contrary to the ordinary direc|tion
of the wind in the Torrid Zone. 2<HI>d,</HI> In
the Lanos, it never rains or thunders, though
they have plentiful dews. 3<HI>d,</HI> It rains almo&s;t
continually in the Andes. 4<HI>th,</HI> In the Sierras,
which lie between the Lanos and the Andes, it
rains from September to April.</P>
<P>It was long thought, that all high mountains
run from we&s;t to ea&s;t, till the contrary direction
was di&s;covered in America. But M. Bourguet
was the fir&s;t who remarked the &s;urpri&s;ing re|gularity
<PB N="241" REF="276">
in the &s;tructure of the&s;e great ma&s;&s;es.
After pa&s;&s;ing the Alps thirty times in fourteen
different places, the Apennines twice, and ma|king
&s;everal tours in the neighbourhood of the&s;e
mountains, and of Mount Jura, he found, that
the contours of all mountains have a near re|&s;emblance
to the works in regular fortifications.
When the direction of a mountain is from we&s;t
to ea&s;t, all its projections, or advances, &s;tretch
to the &s;outh and north. This amazing regula|rity
is &s;o remarkable in the vallies, that one is
apt to imagine that he is walking in a covered
way. If, for example, a man travels in a val|ley
from north to &s;outh, he perceives that the
mountain which lies to the right hand makes
projections to the ea&s;t, and that the projections
of the oppo&s;ite mountain regard the we&s;t, in
&s;uch a manner, that the prominent and concave
angles, on each &s;ide, alternately corre&s;pond with
one another. When the vallies are large, the
angles of the mountains are le&s;s acute, becau&s;e
they are more di&s;tant from each other, and the
declivity is not &s;o rapid or &s;teep. The&s;e angles
are not perceptible in plains, excepting when we
&s;tation our&s;elves on the banks of the rivers,
which generally occupy the middle of them,
and who&s;e natural windings corre&s;pond to the
mo&s;t advanced angles or projections of the
mountains. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;uch an ob|vious
fact &s;hould have remained &s;o long unno|ticed;
for, it is apparent, that, in vallies lined
<PB N="242" REF="277">
with oppo&s;ite mountains, when the declivity of
one of the mountains is le&s;s rapid than that of
the other, the cour&s;e of the rivers is not in the
middle, but neare&s;t to the &s;teepe&s;t mountain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettres Philo&s;ophiques fur la Formation des Sels, p. 181. and 200</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e general ob&s;ervations might be confirm|ed
by a multitude of facts. The moutains of
Switzerland, for example, are &s;teeper on the
&s;outh &s;ide than on the north, and on the we&s;t
&s;ide than on the ea&s;t. This appearance is ob|vious
in Mount Gemmi, Mount Bri&s;a, and in
almo&s;t all the other mountains in this country,
the highe&s;t of which are tho&s;e which &s;eparate
Valle&s;ia, and the Gri&s;ons of Savoy, from Pied|mont
and Tirol. The&s;e countries are, indeed,
only a continuation of the &s;ame mountains, the
chain of which extends to the Mediterranean;
and the Pyrennees are only a continuation of
that va&s;t mountain, which commences in Upper
Valle&s;ia, who&s;e branches &s;tretch far to the we&s;t
and &s;outh, and pre&s;erve, throughout that whole
extent, a great height; but, on the north and
ea&s;t &s;ides, they gradually &s;ink into plains, as ap|pears
in tho&s;e great countries which are traver|&s;ed
by the Rhine and Danube before they fini&s;h
their cour&s;e, while the Rhone de&s;cends with ra|pidity
to the &s;outh, and empties it&s;elf in the
Mediterranean. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is exem|plified
in the mountains of England and of
Norway. But the mo&s;t perfect example is af|forded
<PB N="243" REF="278">
by the mountains of Chili and Peru.
The Cordeliers are exceedingly &s;teep on the
we&s;t &s;ide; but they have a gradual declivity to
the ea&s;t, and terminate in va&s;t plains, that are
watered by the greate&s;t rivers in the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. Abridg. vol. 6. part 6. p. 158.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Bourguet, to whom we are indebted for
the di&s;covery of the corre&s;pondence between
the angles of mountains, calls this di&s;covery <HI>the
Key to the Theory of the Earth.</HI> However, he
appears not to have perceived its whole impor|tance;
for, in his treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, he
gives only the &s;keleton of an hypothetical &s;y&s;tem,
in which mo&s;t of his conclu&s;ions are either fal&s;e
or uncertain. The theory that we have deliver|ed
re&s;ts upon four principal facts, the truth of
which, after examining the proofs that &s;upport
them, cannot admit of a doubt: The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is,
That the earth, to very con&s;iderable depths, is
every where compo&s;ed of parallel &s;trata of dif|ferent
matters, which were formerly in a fluid
or &s;oft &s;tate: The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That the &s;ea has, for
many ages, covered the whole earth which we
now inhabit: The <HI>third,</HI> That the tides, and
other motions of the waters, produce inequali|ties
in the bottom of the &s;ea: And the <HI>fourth,</HI>
That the figure, and corre&s;ponding direction of
mountains, have originated from currents in the
ocean.</P>
<P>After peru&s;ing the proofs contained in the
&s;ub&s;equent articles, the reader will be enabled to
<PB N="244" REF="279">
determine whether I am right in maintaining,
that the&s;e facts, when firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, will
likewi&s;e a&s;certain the genuine theory of the
earth. What has been remarked concerning the
formation of mountains needs no farther expli|cation.
But, as it may be objected, that I have
not accounted for the formation of peaks, or
pointed mountains, nor for &s;ome other particu|lar
facts, I &s;hall add &s;uch ob&s;ervations as have
occurred upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to form a di&s;tinct and
general idea of the manner in which the mate|rials
compo&s;ing this earth are arranged, and
have reduced the whole to two cla&s;&s;es. The
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> includes all the matters that are di&s;po&s;ed in
horizontal, or regularly inclined beds or &s;trata;
and the <HI>&s;econd</HI> comprehends all tho&s;e matters
which appear in detached ma&s;&s;es, in ridges, or
in veins, either perpendicular, or irregularly in|clined.
In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cla&s;s I rank &s;ands, clays,
granites, flints, and free-&s;tones in large ma&s;&s;es,
pit-coal, &s;lates, and likewi&s;e marles, chalk, cal|cinable
&s;tones, marbles, &amp;c. In the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> I in|clude
metals, minerals, cry&s;tals, precious &s;tones,
and flints in detached and &s;mall ma&s;&s;es. Under
the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, all the known materials of the
earth are comprehended. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t
cla&s;s owe their origin to &s;ediments tran&s;ported
and depo&s;ited by the waters of the &s;ea, and ought
to be di&s;tingui&s;hed into tho&s;e that are calcinable
by the application of fire, and tho&s;e that melt,
<PB N="245" REF="280">
and are convertible into gla&s;s. The matters
comprehended under the &s;econd cla&s;s are all
vitrifiable, with the exception of tho&s;e called in|flammable,
or which totally con&s;ume in the fire.</P>
<P>There are, in the fir&s;t cla&s;s, two di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies
of &s;and; the one, which abounds more
than any other matter in the globe, is vitrifiable,
or rather con&s;i&s;ts of fragments of real gla&s;s:
The other, which is le&s;s in quantity, is calci|nable,
and ought to be regarded as the du&s;t of
&s;tone, and as differing from gravel only by the
gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of its grains. In general, vitrifiable
&s;and lies in beds; but they are frequently inter|rupted
by ma&s;&s;es of free-&s;tone, of granite, and
of flint; and &s;ometimes the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances appear
in banks of a con&s;iderable extent.</P>
<P>Sea-&s;hells are &s;eldom found in vitrifiable bo|dies;
and even tho&s;e which appear in them are
not di&s;po&s;ed in beds, but &s;cattered, as it were,
by chance: I never, for example, found any in
free-&s;tone. This &s;tone, which abounds in cer|tain
places, is nothing but &s;and united by a ce|ment.
It never appears but in countries where
vitrifiable &s;and is frequent; and the quarries of
it are generally in pointed hills, in &s;andy lands,
or in interrupted eminences. The&s;e quarries
may be wrought on all &s;ides; and, when they
appear in large beds, they are more di&s;tant from
each other than tho&s;e of marble or calcinable
&s;tones. Blocks of free-&s;tone may be cut of all
dimen&s;ions; and, though it be difficult to work,
<PB N="246" REF="281">
its hardne&s;s is incon&s;iderable; for it is ea&s;ily re|duced
to &s;and by friction, excepting the black
points or nails &s;ometimes found in it, which are
&s;o hard as to re&s;i&s;t the be&s;t files. Common rock|&s;tone,
which I con&s;ider as a &s;pecies of granite,
is vitrifiable, and of a &s;imilar nature with free|&s;tone;
it is only harder, and more firmly ce|mented.
It has likewi&s;e &s;everal den&s;e points,
which cut the &s;hoes of travellers on mountai|nous
grounds. It al&s;o contains a great number
of talky &s;pangles; and the whole is &s;o hard as
not to be worked without great labour.</P>
<P>After narrowly examining the&s;e hard points
found in free-&s;tone and granite, I di&s;covered that
they con&s;i&s;t of metallic matter, which has been
melted and calcined by a &s;trong fire, and that
they have a perfect re&s;emblance to certain &s;ub|&s;tances
thrown out of volcano's, of which I have
&s;een va&s;t quantities in Italy. They are called
by the inhabitants <HI>Schiarri.</HI> They are black
heavy ma&s;&s;es, upon which neither fire, water,
nor the file, can make any impre&s;&s;ion. It is
very different from lava, the latter being a &s;pe|cies
of gla&s;s; but the former &s;eems to partake
more of metal than of gla&s;s. The points in free|&s;tone
and granite have a great re&s;emblance to
this matter, whcih is a farther proof that tho&s;e
&s;ub&s;tances have formerly been liquified by fire.</P>
<P>On the tops of &s;ome high mountains, blocks
of granite appear in great quantities. Their
po&s;itions are &s;o irregular, that they &s;eem to have
<PB N="247" REF="282">
been thrown together by accident; and we
would be apt to imagine that they had tumbled
down from &s;ome neighbouring height, if the
places where they are found were not higher
than any neighbouring ground. But their vi|trifiable
nature, and their angular and &s;quare
figures, like tho&s;e of free-&s;tone rocks, di&s;cover
the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances to have an uncommon origin.
Thus, in large &s;trata of vitrifiable &s;and, we find
blocks of free-&s;tone and granite, the figure and
&s;ituation of which follow not exactly the hori|zontal
po&s;ition of &s;trata. The rains have gra|dually
brought down from the hills and moun|tains
the &s;and with which the&s;e blocks were ori|ginally
covered, by furrowing and cutting into
tho&s;e intervals that appear between the yokes or
nuclei in free-&s;tone, in the &s;ame manner as the
hills of Fountainbleau are inter&s;ected. Every
point of a hill re&s;embles a nucleus in free-&s;tone
quarries, and all the intervals have been &s;cooped
out by the rains, and the &s;and they originally
contained has been carried down to the vallies.
In the &s;ame manner, the angular blocks of gra|nite
on the tops of high mountains were for|merly
covered and &s;urrounded with vitrifiable
&s;and, which being gradually carried off by the
rains, left the blocks in the po&s;ition in which
they happened to be formed. The&s;e blocks are
generally pointed at the top, and augment in
thickne&s;s towards their ba&s;es; one block often
re&s;ts upon another, that upon a third, and &s;o on,
<PB N="248" REF="283">
leaving irregular intervals between them: And
as, in the cour&s;e of time, the &s;and which cover|ed
the blocks, and filled the intervals, was wa&s;h|ed
down by the rains, there would nothing re|main
on the tops of high mountains but pointed
piles of irregular blocks; and hence the origin
of peaks, or mountains ending in &s;harp points.</P>
<P>For, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, as may ea&s;ily be pro|ved
by the &s;ea-bodies found in the Alps, that
this chain of mountains was formerly covered
by the ocean, and that a thick bed of vitrifiable
&s;and was depo&s;ited upon their tops, which redu|ced
the whole chain to a level country. This
bed of &s;and would nece&s;&s;ary give ri&s;e to large
blocks of granite, of free-&s;tone, of flint, and of
other bodies, who&s;e con&s;i&s;tence and figure origi|nate
from &s;and, nearly in the &s;ame manner as
&s;alts cry&s;tallize. The&s;e blocks, after the &s;and
which covered them, and filled their inter&s;tices,
was carried down to the plains by rains, torrents,
&amp;c. would maintain their original &s;tations, re|main
bare on the tops of the mountains, and
con&s;titute all tho&s;e peaks or pointed eminences
&s;o frequently to be met with. To the &s;ame
origin mu&s;t be a&s;cribed tho&s;e high detached rocks
which are found in China and other countries,
as in Ireland, where they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by
the name of <HI>Devil's &s;tones,</HI> and the formation of
which, as well as of peaked mountains, has hi|therto
appeared &s;o difficult to explain. The
explication, however, which I have given, is &s;o
<PB N="249" REF="284">
natural, that it generally occurs to every per&s;on
who examines the&s;e objects; and, on this occa|&s;ion,
I will &s;et down a pa&s;&s;age from father Tar|tre.
'From Yanchuin-yen we arrived at Ho|tcheou;
upon the road we remarked a &s;in|gular
phaenomenon, namely, rocks of a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
height, re&s;embling &s;quare towers, in the
mid&s;t of va&s;t plains. I cannot account for this
appearance, unle&s;s I be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e
rocks to have formerly con&s;tituted a part of
mountains, and that the earth, &s;and, and other
loo&s;e parts, had been gradually wa&s;hed away
by the rains, and left the rocks bare on all &s;ides.
What fortifies this conjecture is, that we &s;aw

<P>The tops of the highe&s;t mountains, often for
200 or 300 fathoms, con&s;i&s;t of rocks of granite,
free-&s;tone, and other hard and vitrifiable &s;ub|&s;tances:
Below this, we frequently meet with
quarries of marble, or hard calcinable &s;tone, full
of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells; as may be &s;een at the great
Chartreu&s;e in Dauphiny, and upon Mount Cenis;
where the &s;tones and marbles that contain &s;hells
are &s;ituated &s;ome hundreds of fathoms below the
points or peaks of high mountains, though the&s;e
beds of &s;tone and marble be more than 1000
fathoms above the level of the &s;ea. Thus tho&s;e
mountains that have peaks or points, generally
<PB N="250" REF="285">
con&s;i&s;t of vitrifiable rocks; and tho&s;e, the &s;um|mits
of which are flat, contain, for the mo&s;t part,
marbles, and hard &s;tones full of &s;ea-bodies. The
&s;ame remark holds with regard to hills; for
tho&s;e compo&s;ed of granite or free-&s;tone, are ge|nerally
inter&s;ected with points, eminences, ca|vities,
and &s;mall vallies. But tho&s;e compo&s;ed
of calcinable &s;tone, are nearly of an equal height,
and are only interrupted by larger and more re|gular
vallies, with corre&s;ponding angles; and
they are crowned with rocks, uniform and level
in their po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e two &s;pecies of mountains &s;eem
to be very different, their figures have been pro|duced
by the &s;ame cau&s;e, as has already been
&s;hown: Only, it may be remarked, that the cal|cinable
&s;tones have &s;uffered no change &s;ince the
original formation of the horizontal &s;trata. But
the vitrifiable &s;ands may have been changed and
interrupted by the &s;ub&s;equent production of
rocks and angular blocks that takes place in &s;and|beds.
Both &s;pecies have fi&s;&s;ures; tho&s;e in cal|cinable
rocks are almo&s;t always perpendicular;
but tho&s;e of granite and free-&s;tone are &s;omewhat
more irregular in their direction. It is in the&s;e
fi&s;&s;ures that metals, minerals, cry&s;tals, &s;ulphur,
and all the &s;ub&s;tances of our &s;econd cla&s;s, are
found. Below the fi&s;&s;ures, the waters a&s;&s;emble,
penetrate the earth, and give ri&s;e to the veins of

<P>I HAVE already remarked, that, in general,
the greate&s;t mountains occupy the middle of
continents; that tho&s;e of a &s;maller kind divide
i&s;lands, penin&s;ula's, and promontories; that, in
the Old Continent, the direction of the greate&s;t
chains of mountains is from we&s;t to ea&s;t; and
that tho&s;e which run to the north or &s;outh, are
only branches of the principal chains. It will
appear, on examination, that the greate&s;t rivers
have the &s;ame direction, and few of them follow
the cour&s;e of the branches of mountains. To
be convinced of this fact, we have only to run
our eye over a common globe; and, beginning
with Spain, we &s;hall find that the Vigo, the
<PB N="252" REF="287">
Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, run from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, and the Ebro from we&s;t to ea&s;t; and
that there is not a river of any con&s;ideration
which runs from &s;outh to north, or from north
to &s;outh, although Spain be almo&s;t entirely en|vironed
by the &s;ea on the northern and &s;outhern
parts. This remark concerning the rivers of
Spain demon&s;trates, that the direction of the
mountains is from we&s;t to ea&s;t; that the &s;ou|thern
provinces near the Straits are more ele|vated
than the coa&s;ts of Portugal; that, in the
northern parts, the mountains of Galicia, the
A&s;turias, &amp;c. are only a continuation of the
Pyrennees; and that this elevation of the coun|try,
both in the &s;outh and north, is the cau&s;e
which prevents the rivers from running to the
&s;ea in the&s;e directions.</P>
<P>In examining the map of France, it is appa|rent,
that the Rhone is the only river which
runs from north to &s;outh; and even near one
half of its cour&s;e, from the mountains to Lyons,
is from ea&s;t to we&s;t: But the direction of all the
great rivers, as the Loire, the Charente, the Ga|ronne,
and even the Seine, is from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds with regard to
Germany. The Rhine, like the Rhone, has the
greate&s;t part of its cour&s;e from &s;outh to north:
But the other large rivers, as the Danube, the
Drave, and all the rivers which fall into them,
run from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and empty them&s;elves in
the Black Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="288">
The Black Sea, which &s;hould rather be re|garded
as a large lake, is, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, near|ly
three times as long as from &s;outh to north;
and con&s;equently its direction is &s;imilar to that
of the rivers. The &s;ame remark is applicable
to the Mediterranean, which is nearly &s;ix times
longer from ea&s;t to we&s;t than from north to
&s;outh.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;pian, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, ac|cording
to the chart made by order of the Czar
Peter I. extends more from north to &s;outh, than
from ea&s;t to we&s;t. But the antient charts re|pre&s;ented
it as nearly round, or rather as ex|tending
more from ea&s;t to we&s;t than in the
oppo&s;ite direction. If, however, the lake Aral
be con&s;idered as a part of the Ca&s;pian, from
which it is &s;eparated only by a &s;andy plain, the
greate&s;t extent of this &s;ea will &s;till be from we&s;t
to ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of the Euphrates, of the Per&s;ic
gulf, and of almo&s;t all the rivers of China, is
likewi&s;e from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The rivers of the
interior parts of Africa ob&s;erve the &s;ame direc|tion,
running either from we&s;t to ea&s;t, or from
ea&s;t to we&s;t. The Nile, and the rivers of Bar|bary,
are the only ones that run from &s;outh to
north. There are, it is true, large rivers in A|&s;ia,
as the Don, the Wolga, &amp;c. which partly
run from north to &s;outh: But they only ob|&s;erve
this direction in order to fall into the Black
<PB N="254" REF="289">
and Ca&s;pian &s;eas, which are lakes in the interior
parts of the country.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, lay it down as a fact,
that, in general, the rivers and mediterranean
waters of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, run or
&s;tretch more from ea&s;t to we&s;t than from north
to &s;outh. This is a natural con&s;equence of the
parallel direction of the different chains of
mountains. Be&s;ides, the whole continent of
Europe and of A&s;ia is broader from ea&s;t to we&s;t
than from north to &s;outh: For the direction of
mountains may be con&s;idered in two points of
view; in a long and narrow continent, like that
of South America, which contains only one
principal chain of mountains, extending from
&s;outh to north, the rivers, not being re&s;trained
by any parallel chain, mu&s;t run in channels per|pendicular
to the range of the&s;e mountains, that
is, either from ea&s;t to we&s;t, or from we&s;t to
ea&s;t; and this, in fact, is the direction of all the
great rivers in America. But though, both in
the Old and New Continent, the great rivers
run in the &s;ame direction, this effect is produ|ced
by different cau&s;es. The rivers, in the Old
Continent, run from ea&s;t to we&s;t, becau&s;e they
are confined by many parallel chains of moun|tains
that &s;tretch from we&s;t to ea&s;t; but tho&s;e
of America ob&s;erve the &s;ame direction, becau&s;e
there is only one cahin of mountains &s;tretching
from &s;outh to north.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="290">
The rivers generally occupy the middle of
the vallies, or the lowe&s;t ground between two
oppo&s;ite hills: If the two hills have nearly an
equal declivity, the river runs nearly in the mid|dle
between them, whether the intermediate
valley be broad or narrow. If, on the contra|ry,
the declivity of one of the hills be greater
than that of the other, the river will not occupy
the middle of the valley, but will approach to
the &s;teepe&s;t hill, in proportion to the &s;uperiority
of its declivity. In this ca&s;e, the middle of the
valley is not the lowe&s;t ground between the two
hills, but lies much nearer the &s;teepe&s;t of them;
and con&s;equently the river mu&s;t occupy this
&s;pace. This ob&s;ervation holds univer&s;ally where|ever
the difference in declivity is any ways re|markable;
and the rivers never recede from the
&s;teepe&s;t hills, unle&s;s, in their cour&s;e, they meet
with other hills of equal declivity. In proce&s;s
of time, however, the declivity of the &s;teepe&s;t
hill is dimini&s;hed by the rains, the melting of
&s;now, &amp;c. The &s;teeper any hill is, it lo&s;es great|er
quantities of earth, &s;and, and gravel, by the
operation of rains, and the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are car|ried
down into the plain with a proportionably
greater rapidity, and, of cour&s;e, force the ri|ver
to change its channel, or, in other words, to
retire into a lower part of the valley. To this
it may be added, that, as all rivers occa&s;ionally
&s;well, and overflow their banks, they carry off
mud and &s;and, which they depo&s;ite in different
<PB N="256" REF="291">
parts of the valley; and, as &s;and and gravel are
often accumulated in the channels them&s;elves,
the&s;e circum&s;tances make the waters overflow
and alter the direction of their cour&s;e. Nothing,
accordingly, is more common, than to find in
vallies many old channels in which the river has
formerly run, e&s;pecially when it is rapid, &s;ub|ject
to frequent inundations, and carries down
great quantities of &s;and and mud.</P>
<P>In plains, and exten&s;ive valleys, watered by
large rivers, the channels of the rivers are com|monly
the lowe&s;t parts: But the &s;urface of the
water in the river is &s;ometimes higher than the
adjacent ground. When a river, for in&s;tance,
begins to overflow, it &s;oon covers a con&s;iderable
part of the plain; but the banks remain longe&s;t
uncovered by the water. This plainly demon|&s;trates
the banks to be higher than the neigh|bouring
ground; and from the banks, to a cer|tain
part of the plain, there is a &s;mall declivity
or &s;lope. When, therefore, the water ri&s;es to
the margin of the banks, it mu&s;t be higher than
the plain. This elevation of the ground on the
banks of rivers is occa&s;ioned by mud and
&s;and being depo&s;ited in the time of inundations.
The water, during great &s;wells, is always ex|ceedingly
foul and muddy: When it begins to
overflow, it runs &s;lowly over the banks, and, by
depo&s;iting the mud and &s;and, it gradually puri|fies
as it advances into the plain: Thus, all the
mud, and other &s;ub&s;tances, that are not carried
<PB N="257" REF="292">
down by the current, are depo&s;ited upon the
banks, and gradually elevate them above the
re&s;t of the plain.</P>
<P>Rivers are always wide&s;t at their mouths, and
turn gradually narrower towards their &s;ources:
But it is more worthy of remark, that, in the in|terior
parts of a country, and at great di&s;tances
from the &s;ea, their cour&s;e is &s;traight, and the
frequency of their windings increa&s;es propor|tionably
as they approach to their termination.
I have been informed by M. Fabry, who per|formed
many journeys in the we&s;tern parts of
North America, that travellers, and even the &s;a|vages,
form pretty accurate computations of
their di&s;tance from the &s;ea, by ob&s;erving the
cour&s;es of the rivers. If a river ran &s;traight for
15 or 20 leagues, they knew them&s;elves to be a
great way from the coa&s;t; but, if the &s;inuo&s;ities
were frequent, they concluded that the &s;ea was
not very di&s;tant. M. Fabry, when travelling
through unknown and uninhabited regions, de|rived
much advantage from this ob&s;ervation.
Near the &s;ides of great rivers, the regorging of
the water is likewi&s;e le&s;s apparent the farther
from the &s;ea, which furni&s;hes another medium
of judging concerning the di&s;tance: And, as the
&s;inuo&s;ities multiply the nearer rivers approach
to their mouths, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;ome of
them &s;hould yield to the pre&s;&s;ure of the water,
and give ri&s;e to &s;everal branches, or divi&s;ions,
before they reach the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="293">
The motion of the water in rivers is very dif|ferent
from the repre&s;entation given of it by
mathematicians. The &s;urface, taken from bank
to bank, is not level; but the middle of the
&s;tream is either higher or lower, according to
circum&s;tances, than the water at the &s;ides. When
a river &s;wells &s;uddenly by the melting of &s;now,
or any other cau&s;e, its rapidity increa&s;es; and, if
its cour&s;e be &s;traight, the middle of the &s;tream,
where the current is greate&s;t, ri&s;es and forms a
&s;en&s;ible convexity. This elevation is &s;ometimes
very con&s;iderable. M. Hupeau, who mea&s;ured
this difference of level between the &s;ides and
the &s;tream of the Aveiron, found it to be three
feet. This effect mu&s;t always be produced
when the rapidity of the current is great; for
the quickne&s;s of the motion, by dimini&s;hing, or
partly preventing the action of gravity, allows
not to the water, in the middle of the &s;tream,
time &s;ufficient to bring it to a level with that on
the &s;ides, and, therefore, it remains higher. On
the other hand, near the mouths, though the
current be very rapid, the water near the &s;ides
is commonly more elevated than that of the
middle: The river, in this &s;ituation, has a con|cave
form, the lowe&s;t point of which is the
middle of the &s;tream. This always happens as
far as the influence of the tides is perceptible,
which, in large rivers, extends &s;ometimes to 100
or 200 leagues from the &s;ea. It is likewi&s;e a
fact well known, that the &s;treams of rivers con|tinue
<PB N="259" REF="294">
their motion a con&s;iderable way through
the waters of the &s;ea. In this ca&s;e, the water of
the river has two oppo&s;ite motions. The middle,
or current, precipitates it&s;elf towards the &s;ea;
but the action of the tide produces a counter
current, or regorging, which elevates the water
on the &s;ides, while that in the middle de&s;cends;
and, as all the water mu&s;t be carried down by
the current, that on the &s;ides con&s;tantly de&s;cends
towards the middle of the &s;tream, with a quick|ne&s;s
proportioned to the elevation it receives
from the regorging of the tide.</P>
<P>There are two &s;pecies of regorging, or dam|ming
up, in rivers: The fir&s;t is that ju&s;t now
de&s;cribed, and is occa&s;ioned by the action of the
ride, which not only oppo&s;es the natural de&s;cent
of the water, but even communicates to it a
contrary motion or current: The other is pro|duced
by an inactive cau&s;e, as a projection of
the land, an i&s;land, &amp;c. Though this kind of
regorging gives not ri&s;e to any extraordinary
counter current, it often &s;en&s;ibly retards the pro|gre&s;s
of &s;mall boats, and produces what is called
<HI>dead water,</HI> which ob&s;erves not the natural cour&s;e
of the river, but turns about in &s;uch a manner
as greatly ob&s;tructs the progre&s;s of ve&s;&s;els. The&s;e
dead waters are &s;en&s;ibly felt in pa&s;&s;ing through
the arches of a bridge, e&s;pecially if the river be
rapid. The celerity with which water runs,
when the height or pre&s;&s;ure is the &s;ame, increa&s;es
in proportion as the diameter of the canal,
<PB N="260" REF="295">
through which it pa&s;&s;es, is dimini&s;hed. The ce|lerity
of a river, therefore, in pa&s;&s;ing through a
bridge, increa&s;es in the inver&s;e proportion of the
width of the whole arches, to the total width of
the river. This increa&s;e of celerity, in pa&s;&s;ing
through the arch of a bridge, is &s;o con&s;iderable,
that it pu&s;hes the water from the &s;tream towards
the banks, from which it is reflected, and &s;ome|times
forms violent eddies or whirlpools. In
pa&s;&s;ing under the bridge of St E&s;prit, the mari|ners
are obliged &s;crupulou&s;ly to keep the &s;tream,
even after leaving the bridge; for, if they al|lowed
the boat to decline either to the right or
left, it would be driven with violence again&s;t
the banks, or, at lea&s;t, would be forced into the
whirling or dead waters, from which they would
find &s;ome difficulty of e&s;caping. When the
eddy is con&s;iderable, it forms a &s;mall gulf with
a cylindrical void in the middle of it, round
which the water turns with rapidity. This cy|lindrical
cavity is an effect of the centrifugal
force, which makes the water endeavour to fly
off from the center of the whirlpool.</P>
<P>When a great &s;well of the river is about to
happen, the water-men perceive a particular
motion, which they call a <HI>moving at the bottom</HI>;
that is, when the water at the bottom moves with
an unu&s;ual velocity, which, according to them,
always indicates the approach of a &s;udden &s;well.
The motion and weight of the &s;uperior waters,
though not yet arrived, fail not to act upon the
<PB N="261" REF="296">
waters in the inferior parts of the river, and to
communicate motion to them: For a river, in
&s;ome re&s;pects, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a column
of water contained in a tube, and its channel as a
long canal, in which every motion mu&s;t be com|municated
from one end of it to the other. Now,
independent of the motion of the &s;uperior wa|ters,
their weight alone may increa&s;e the celeri|ty
of the river, and perhaps make it move quick|e&s;t
at the bottom; for, it is well known, that,
when &s;everal boats are all at once pu&s;hed into a
river, they increa&s;e the motion of the water be|low,
and retard that of the &s;uperior water.</P>
<P>The celerity of running waters is not in ex|act
proportion to the declivity of their channels.
A river with a uniform declivity, and double to
that of another, ought not, it would appear, to
run with more than a double celerity: But its
celerity is much more quick, being &s;ometimes
triple, &s;ometimes quadruple, &amp;c. The celerity
depeends more upon the quantity of water, and
the weight of the &s;uperior waters, than upon
the degree of de&s;cent. In digging the bed of a
river or drain, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to make the de|&s;cent
uniform through its whole extent. A
quick motion is more ea&s;ily produced by ma|king
the declivity much greater at the &s;ource
then at the mouth, where, like the beds of na|tural
rivers, it is almo&s;t imperceptible, and yet
they pre&s;erve their celerity, which is more or
le&s;s, according to the quantity they contain; for,
<PB N="262" REF="297">
in great rivers, even where the ground is level,
the water &s;till runs, not only with the velocity
originally acquired, but with the accumulated
velocity produced by the action and weight of
the &s;uperior waters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By not attending to the&s;e circum&s;tances, M. Khun was led fal&s;ely to affirm, that the &s;ource of the Danube was at lea&s;t two German miles higher than its mouth; that the Mediterranean is 6&frac34; German miles lower than the &s;ources of the Nile; that the Atlantic ocean is half a mile lower than the Mediterranean, &amp;c.</NOTE>. To make this matter &s;till
more plain, let us &s;uppo&s;e the Seine from Pont|neuf
to Pont-royal to be perfectly level, and to
be ten feet deep; let us al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e the bed of
the river below Pont-royal and above Pont-neuf,
to be &s;uddenly dried up; the waters, in this ca&s;e,
would run both up and down the channel, till
their equilibrium was perfectly re&s;tored. This
effect is produced entirely by the weight of the
water, which never allows it to remain at re&s;t
till its particles are equally pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides,
and its &s;urface reduced to a perfect level. The
weight of water, therefore, contributes greatly
to increa&s;e the celerity of its motion. This is
the rea&s;on why the greate&s;t celerity in a current
of water is neither at the bottom nor at the &s;ur|face,
but nearly in the middle, which is pre&s;&s;ed
both by the column above, and by the reaction
from the bottom. But, what is &s;till more, when
a river acquires a great celerity, it will not only
pre&s;erve it, though running through a level
country, but even &s;urmount heights, without
<PB N="263" REF="298">
&s;preading much to a &s;ide, or, at lea&s;t, without
producing an inundation of any moment.</P>
<P>One would be apt to imagine, that bridges,
and other ob&s;tacles erected in rivers, would create
a con&s;iderable diminution of celerity in their
whole cour&s;e. But the difference is very &s;mall.
The water, upon meeting with any ob&s;tacle, ri&s;es,
in order to &s;urmount it; and the increa&s;e of ce|lerity
communicated by its fall, nearly compen|&s;ates
the retardation occa&s;ioned by the ob&s;tacle.
Thus, &s;inuo&s;ities, projections from the land, and
i&s;lands, create but a &s;mall variation on the total
celerity of a river's cour&s;e. The mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable
alterations are produced by the greater or
le&s;&s;er quantities of water; when the quantity is
&s;mall, a river runs &s;low, when great, it runs with
rapidity.</P>
<P>If rivers were always equally full, to enlarge
their channels would be the be&s;t method of di|mini&s;hing
their rapidity, and to contain them
within their banks. But, as almo&s;t all rivers
ri&s;e and fall, it is more nece&s;&s;ary, for this latter
purpo&s;e, to narrow their channels; for &s;mall
waters, with large channels, generally &s;coop
out winding beds in the middle; and, when they
&s;well, they follow the direction of the&s;e particu|lar
beds, and, by &s;triking with violence again&s;t
the banks, often do much injury to mills and
other works. The&s;e bad effects might be pre|vented,
by digging gulfs in the earth at conve|nient
di&s;tances. To accompli&s;h this, a part of
<PB N="264" REF="299">
one of the banks &s;hould be cut through, and the
earth removed for a con&s;iderable &s;pace. The&s;e
&s;mall gulfs &s;hould be made in the obtu&s;e angles
of the river; for the water, in turning, would
run into them; and, of cour&s;e, its celerity would
be dimini&s;hed. This method might be u&s;eful in
preventing the fall of bridges in places where
&s;ufficient barriers cannot be erected to re&s;i&s;t the
weight of the water.</P>
<P>The manner in which inundations are pro|duced,
merits particular attention. When a ri|ver
&s;wells, its celerity uniformly increa&s;es, till
it begins to overflow the banks: From that mo|ment
its rapidity is checked, which is the rea&s;on
why inundations always continue &s;everal days;
for, though the quantity of water &s;hould be
dimini&s;hed after the commencement of the in|undation,
it would, notwith&s;tanding, continue
to overflow; becau&s;e this circum&s;tance depends
more on the celerity than on the quantity of
water. If it were otherwi&s;e, rivers would often
overflow their banks for an hour or two, and
then retire to their channels, which never does
happen. An inundation, on the contrary, al|ways
la&s;ts &s;ome days, &s;uppo&s;ing the rains have
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and le&s;s water runs in the river; becau&s;e
the overflowing of waters dimini&s;hes their ecle|rity;
and, con&s;equently, although the &s;ame
quantity of water arrives not in the &s;ame time
as formerly, the effect is the &s;ame as if a larger
quantity had been brought down. It may like|wi&s;e
<PB N="265" REF="300">
here be remarked, that, if a high wind
blows contrary to the current of the river, the
inundation will be increa&s;ed by this occa&s;ional
cau&s;e, which dimini&s;hes the celerity of the wa|ter;
but, if the wind blows in the direction of
the current, the inundation will be le&s;s, and re|tire
more quickly.</P>
<P>'The inundation of the Nile,' &s;ays M. Gran|ger,
'has long been a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion a|mong
the learned. Mo&s;t of them have con&s;i|dered
it as a &s;ingular and wonderful phaenome|non,
though nothing be more natural or more
common; for it takes place in every country,
as well as in Egypt. The inundation of the
Nile is occa&s;ioned by the rains which fall in
Aethiopia and Aby&s;&s;inia; but the north wind
may be regarded as the principal cau&s;e of it:
1. Becau&s;e the north wind drives the clouds
that contain this rain into Aby&s;&s;inia: 2. Be|cau&s;e
it prevents the water from running out
of the mouths of the river in any great quan|tity,
by damming up the &s;tream. The great
effect of this wind may be remarked every
&s;ea&s;on; for, when it changes from north, the
Nile lo&s;es more water in one day than in four.'</P>
<P>Inundations are generally greate&s;t in the &s;u|perior
parts of rivers; becau&s;e, as formerly ob|&s;erved,
the velocity of a river uniformly in|crea&s;es
till it empties it&s;elf in the ocean. Father
Co&s;telli, a &s;en&s;ible writer on this &s;ubject, re|marks,
that the banks, rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of
<PB N="266" REF="301">
keeping the Po from overflowing, gradually di|mini&s;h
in height, as the river approaches to the
&s;ea; that, at Ferrara, which is 60 or 70 miles
from the mouth of the river, the banks are a|bout
20 feet above the ordinary level of the
water; but that, at 10 or 12 miles from the

at Ferrara, they are not above 12 feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Racolta d'autori che trattano del moto dell' acque, vel. 1. p. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In fine, the theory of running waters is &s;ub|ject
to many difficulties. It is not ea&s;y to give
general rules that will apply to every particular
ca&s;e. For this purpo&s;e, experience is preferable
to &s;peculation: It is not enough that we know
the common effects of rivers in general; but, if
we would rea&s;on ju&s;tly, and give &s;tability to
our operations, we ought to &s;tudy the peculiari|ties
of particular rivers in which we have an
intere&s;t. Though the remarks I have made be
generally new, a greater collection is nece&s;&s;ary;
and perhaps we &s;hall in time acquire a di&s;tinct
knowledge of this &s;ubject, and be enabled to
give certain rules for directing and confining
rivers in &s;uch a manner as will prevent the de|&s;truction
of bridges, banks, and other damages

<P>In order to compute the quantity of water
di&s;charged into the &s;ea by all the rivers, we &s;hall
&s;uppo&s;e, which is nearly the truth, that one half
of the earth's &s;urface is &s;ea, and the other half
dry land: We &s;hall likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e the mean
depth of the &s;ea to be about 230 fathoms. The
total &s;urface of the earth is 170981012 &s;quare
miles, and that of the &s;ea is 85490506 &s;quare
miles, which being multiplied by 1-fourth,
the depth of the &s;ea, gives 21372626 cubic
miles for the quantity of water contained
in the whole ocean. Now, to compute the
quantity di&s;charged into the ocean by the
rivers, let us take a river, the velocity and
quantity of who&s;e waters are known; the Po,
for example, which pa&s;&s;es through Lombardy,
and waters a country of 380 miles in length.
According to Riccioli, the breadth of the Po, be|fore
it divides into branches, is 100 perches of
Boulogne, or 1000 feet; and its depth is 10
feet; and it runs at the rate of 4 miles in an
<PB N="270" REF="305">
hour: Con&s;equently, the Po di&s;charges into the
&s;ea 200,000 cubical perches of water in an hour,
or 4,800,000 in a day. But a cubic mile con|tains
125,000,000 cubic perches; of cour&s;e, it
will require 26 days to di&s;charge into the &s;ea a
cubic mile of water. It only remains to deter|mine
the proportion that the Po bears to all the
rivers of the earth taken together, which cannot
be done exactly. But, to approach nearly to the
truth, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the quantity of water
which the &s;ea receives from the great rivers in
every country, is proportioned to the extent of
the &s;urfaces of the&s;e countries; and, con&s;equent|ly,
that the country watered by the Po, and by
the rivers which fall into it, is to the total &s;ur|face
of the dry land as the Po is to all the rivers
of the earth. Now, by the mo&s;t exact charts,
it appears, that the Po, from its origin to its
mouth, traver&s;es a country of 380 miles in
length; and the rivers which fall into it on each
&s;ide ari&s;e from &s;ources which are about 60 miles
di&s;tant from the Po. Thus, the Po, and the ri|vers
it receives, water a country 380 miles long,
and 120 broad, which makes 45600 &s;quare
miles. But the &s;urface of the dry land is
85490506 &s;quare miles; con&s;equently, the quan|tity
of water carried to the &s;ea by all the rivers
will be 1874 times greater than the quantity
di&s;charged by the Po. But, as 26 rivers, equal
to the Po, furni&s;h a cubic mile of water each
day, it follows, that, in the &s;pace of a year,
<PB N="271" REF="306">
1874 rivers equal to the Po, will carry to the
&s;ea 26308 cubic miles of water; and that, in
812 years, all the&s;e rivers would di&s;charge
21372626 cubic miles, which is a quantity equal
to what is contained in the ocean; of cour&s;e, if
the ocean were empty, 812 years would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to fill it by the rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See keil's examination of Burnet's theory, p. 126.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is a re&s;ult of this calculation, that the quan|tity
of water rai&s;ed from the &s;ea by evapora|tion,
and tran&s;ported upon land by the winds,
is from 20 to 21 inches in the year, or about &frac23;
of a French line each day. This evaporation,
though tripled to make allowance for what falls
back into the &s;ea from the clouds, is very incon|&s;iderable.
Mr Halley<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. num. 192.</NOTE> has clearly demon&s;trated,
that the vapours tran&s;ported from the &s;ea, and
di&s;charged upon the land, are &s;ufficient to main|tain
all the rivers and lakes in the world.</P>
<P>After the Nile, the Jordan is the large&s;t river
in the Levant, or even in Barbary. It di&s;charges
each day into the Dead Sea about 6,000,000 of
tons. All this water, and more, is carried off
by evaporation; for, according to Halley's cal|culation
of 6914 tons evaporated from each &s;u|perficial
mile, the Dead Sea, which is 72 miles
long and 18 broad, mu&s;t lo&s;e, every day, by
evaporation, near 9,000,000 of tons; that is,
not only all the water it receives from the Jor|dan,
but from the &s;maller rivers which come
<PB N="272" REF="307">
from the mountains of Moab, and el&s;ewhere.
Of cour&s;e, this &s;ea has no occa&s;ion to communi|cate
with any other by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t rapid of all rivers are, the Tigris,
the Indus, the Danube, the Yrtis in Siberia, the
Malmi&s;tra in Cilicia, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Varenii Geog. p. 178.</NOTE> But, as was for|merly
remarked, the velocity of rivers depends
both on the declivity and the weight of water.
In examining the globe, we find, that the Da|nube
has le&s;s declivity than the Po, the Rhine,
or the Rhone; for, the cour&s;e of the Danube is
longer, and it falls into the Black Sea, which is
higher than the Mediterranean, and perhaps
than the ocean.</P>
<P>Great rivers, in their cour&s;e, are con&s;tantly
receiving &s;mall ones into their channels. The
Danube, for example, receives more than 200
brooks and rivulets. But, if we reckon only
rivers of &s;ome con&s;ideration, we will find, that
the Danube receives 30 or 31, the Wolga 32 or
33, the Don 5 or 6, the Nieper 19 or 20, the
Duine 11 or 12. The Hoanho, in A&s;ia, receives
34 or 35 rivers, the Jeni&s;ca more than 60, the
Oby an equal number, the Amour about 40, the
Kian, or river of Nankin, 30, the Ganges more
than 20, the Euphrates 10 or 11, &amp;c. In Afri|ca,
the Senegal receives more than 20 rivers;
the Nile receives none lower than 500 leagues
from its mouth, the la&s;t which falls into it be|ing
the Moraba; and from this place to its
<PB N="273" REF="308">
&s;ource, it receives about 12 or 13. In America,
the Amazones receives more than 60 con&s;ide|rable
rivers, St Laurence about 40, reckoning
tho&s;e which fall into the lakes, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi
more than 40, the Plata above 50, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;urface of the earth, there are ele|vated
countries which &s;eem to be points of par|tition
marked out by nature for the di&s;tribution
of the waters. In Europe, one of the&s;e points
is Mont Saint-Godard, and its environs. A|nother
point is the country &s;ituated between the
provinces of Belozera and Wologda in Mu&s;covy,
from which many rivers de&s;cend, &s;ome into the
White Sea, &s;ome into the Black, and others into
the Ca&s;pian. In A&s;ia there are &s;everal points of
partition, as the country of the Mogul Tartars,
&s;ome of who&s;e rivers run into the &s;ea of Nova
Zembla, others into the gulf of Linchidolin,
others into the &s;ea of Corea, and others into that
of China; and the Le&s;&s;er Thibet, the rivers of
which run into the Chine&s;e &s;ea, into the gulf of
Bengal, the gulf of Cambaia, and the lake Aral.
The province of Quito, in America, di&s;charges
its rivers into the &s;outh and north &s;eas, and into
the gulf of Mexico.</P>
<P>There are, in the Old Continent, about 430
rivers which directly fall either into the Ocean,
or into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. But,
in the New Continent, we know of only 145
rivers that fall immediately into the &s;ea. In this
<PB N="274" REF="309">
number I have reckoned none that are not as
large as the river Somme in Picardy.</P>
<P>All the&s;e rivers tran&s;port, from the countries
through which they pa&s;s, into the &s;ea, great
quantities of mineral and &s;aline particles. The
particles of &s;alt, which di&s;&s;olve in water, are ea&s;ily
carried down to the &s;ea. Several philo&s;ophers, and
particularly Halley, have alledged, that the &s;alt|ne&s;s
of the &s;ea proceeds alone from the particles
of &s;alt tran&s;ported by the rivers: Others main|tain,
that this &s;altne&s;s was coeval with the &s;ea
it&s;elf, and that the &s;alt was created to prevent
the waters from corrupting. But the agitation
of the &s;ea by the winds and the tides is, I ima|gine,
a cau&s;e equally powerful as the &s;alt in pre|&s;erving
it again&s;t putrifaction; for, when bar|relled
up, it corrupts in a few days. And Boyle
informs us of a navigator who was overtaken
with a calm which la&s;ted 13 days, and who a&s;|&s;ured
him, that the water became &s;o putrid, that,
if the calm had continued much longer, the
whole crew would have peri&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Boyle, vol. 3. p. 222.</NOTE>. Sea-water is
al&s;o impregnated with a bituminous oil, which
renders it both unwhole&s;ome, and di&s;agreeable
to the ta&s;te. The quantity of &s;alt in &s;ea-water
is about a fortieth part, and it is nearly of an
equal &s;altne&s;s at the &s;urface and at the bottom,
under the Line and at the Cape of Good Hope;
though there are &s;ome particular places, as off
the Mo&s;ambique coa&s;t, where it is more &s;alt than
<PB N="275" REF="310">
in others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Boyle, vol. 3. p 217.</NOTE>. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid to be le&s;s &s;alt
within the Arctic circle: But this phaenomenon
may proceed from the immen&s;e quantities of
&s;now, and the large rivers which fall into the&s;e
&s;eas, and from the proportional defect of evapo|ration.</P>
<P>However this matter &s;tands, I believe, that
the &s;altne&s;s of the ocean is not only occa&s;ioned
by the many banks of &s;alt at the bottom of the
&s;ea, and along the coa&s;ts, but likewi&s;e by the
&s;alts continually brought down by the rivers;
that Halley was right in his conjecture that
there was originally little or no &s;alt in the &s;ea,
but that its &s;altne&s;s gradually augmented in pro|portion
as it was &s;upplied by the rivers; that
the degree of &s;altne&s;s is perpetually increa&s;ing;
and, con&s;equently, that, by computing the total
quantity of &s;alt carried down by the rivers, we
might be enabled to di&s;cover the real age of the
world. Mr Boyle affirms, on the authority of
divers and pearl-fi&s;hers, that the water is colder
in proportion to its depth; and that, at great
depths, the cold becomes &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to oblige
them to come up much &s;ooner than u&s;ual. But
the weight of the water may be as much the
cau&s;e of their unea&s;ine&s;s as the inten&s;ene&s;s of the
cold, e&s;pecially when they de&s;cend 300 or 400
fathom. Divers, however, &s;eldom go deeper
than 100 feet. The &s;ame author relates, that,
in a voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies, when they ar|rived
<PB N="276" REF="311">
at the 35th degree of &s;outh latitude, they
&s;ounded to the depth of 400 fathoms, and when
the lead, which weighed about 30 pounds, was
drawn up, it had become as cold as ice. It is
likewi&s;e a common practice at &s;ea, to &s;ink the
bottles &s;everal fathoms, in order to cool their
wine; and, it is &s;aid, that the deeper the bottles
are &s;unk, the wine becomes the cooler.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts would lead us to imagine, that
the &s;ea-water was &s;alter at the bottom than at
the &s;urface. But they are oppo&s;ed by facts of a
contrary nature: Experiments have been made
with ve&s;&s;els which opened only at a certain depth,
and the water was not found to be &s;alter than
that at the &s;urface. There are even examples
of the water at the bottom being fre&s;her than at
the &s;urface: This phaenomenon is exhibited in
all tho&s;e places where &s;prings ari&s;e from the bot|tom
of the &s;ea, as near Goa, at Ormus, and in
the &s;ea of Naples, in which there are many
warm &s;prings.</P>
<P>In other places, &s;ulphurous &s;prings and beds
of bitumen have been di&s;covered at the bottom
of the &s;ea; and, upon land, there are numerous
&s;prings of bitumen that run down into the &s;ea. At
Barbadoes, there is a fountain of bitumen which
runs from the rocks into the &s;ea. Bitumen and
&s;alt, then, are the principal ingredients in &s;ea|water.
But it is blended with many other &s;ub|&s;tances;
for its ta&s;te differs con&s;iderably in dif|ferent
parts of the ocean: Be&s;ides, agitation and
<PB N="277" REF="312">
the heat of the &s;un change the natural ta&s;te of
&s;ea-water, and the different colours of different
&s;eas, and even of the &s;ame &s;ea at different times,
prove it to be mixed with many heterogeneous
bodies, which are detached either from the bot|tom,
or carried down by the rivers.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t countries that are furni&s;hed with large
rivers are &s;ubject to periodical inundations; and
tho&s;e rivers which have long cour&s;es overflow
with the greate&s;t regularity. Every body has
heard of the inundations of the Nile, the waters
of which, though &s;pread over a large track of
country, and at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ea,
pre&s;erve their &s;weetne&s;s and tran&s;parency. Strabo
and other antient authors tell us, that the Nile
had &s;even mouths; but now only two that are
navigable remain: A third canal, indeed, &s;up|plies
the ci&s;terns of Alexandria; and there is a
fourth which is &s;till le&s;s con&s;iderable. As the
cleaning of their canals has long been neglected,
they are mo&s;tly in ruins. In the&s;e works the
antients annually employed a va&s;t number of
workmen and &s;oldiers, who carried off the mud
and &s;and which this river brings down in great
quantities. The overflowing of the Nile is oc|ca&s;ioned
by the rains that fall in Aethiopia: They
begin in April, and end not till September. Du|ring
the fir&s;t three months, the days are &s;erene
and beautiful; but the &s;un no &s;ooner &s;ets, than
the rains begin, continue ince&s;&s;antly till &s;un|ri&s;ing,
and are commonly accompanied with
<PB N="278" REF="313">
thunder and lightning. The inundation in
Egypt begins about the 17th of June; it gene|rally
takes 40 days in &s;welling, and as many in
&s;ub&s;iding. The whole flat country of Egypt is
overflowed: But the inundation is not now &s;o
great as in antient times; for Herodotus affirms,
that the Nile &s;welled 100 days, and required an
equal time to &s;ub&s;ide. If this fact be true, the
difference can be a&s;cribed to no other cau&s;e but
the gradual elevation of the land by the mud
depo&s;ited by the waters, and the diminution in
the height of the mountains from which this
river derives its &s;ource. It is natural to think,
that the height of the mountains is dimini&s;hed;
for the heavy rains that fall in the&s;e regions du|ring
one half of the year, bring down great
quantities of &s;and and earth from the tops of
the mountains into the vallies, from which they
are tran&s;ported by torrents into the channel of
the Nile, and are partly depo&s;ited on the land by
means of the inundations.</P>
<P>The Nile is not the only river that has regu|lar
and annual overflowings: The Pegu, which
is equally regular in its inundations, has, from
this circum&s;tance, got the name of the <HI>Indian
Nile.</HI> It overflows the country for 30 leagues
beyond its banks, and, like the Nile, leaves great
quantities of mud and &s;lime, which enrich the
ground &s;o much, that it produces excellent pa|&s;ture
for cattle, and enables the inhabitants to
<PB N="279" REF="314">
export rice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les Voyages d' Ovington, tom. 2. p. 290.</NOTE>. The Niger, or, which is the &s;ame
thing, the upper part of the Senegal, overflows
and covers the whole flat country of Nigritia.
Its inundation, like that of the Nile, begins about
the middle of June, and increa&s;es for 40 days.
The Plata, in Bra&s;il, overflows annually, and at
the &s;ame time with the Nile. The Ganges, the
Indus, the Euphrates, and &s;ome other rivers,
produce annual inundations. But all rivers are
not &s;ubject to periodic inundations: The&s;e pro|ceed
from a combination of cau&s;es, which, at
the &s;ame time, augment the quantity of water,
and dimini&s;h its velocity.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the declivity of
rivers gradually dimini&s;h till they arrive at the
&s;ea. But, in &s;ome places, the declivity is more
&s;udden, and forms what is called <HI>a cataract,</HI>
which is nothing more than an unu&s;ually rapid
fall of the water. In the Rhine, for example,
there are two cataracts, one at Bilefeld, and the
other near Schafhou&s;e. The Nile has &s;everal
cataracts, two of the mo&s;t remarkable fall from
a great height, between two mountains. In the
Wologda, in Mu&s;covy, there are al&s;o two, near
Ladoga. The Zaire, a river in Congo, com|mences
with a large cataract which falls from
the top of a mountain. But the mo&s;t celebra|ted
cataract is that of the river Niagara in Ca|nada:
It falls, in a prodigious torrent, 156 feet
of perpendicular height, and is a fourth part of
<PB N="280" REF="315">
a league in breadth. The vapour of the water
ri&s;es to the clouds, is &s;een at the di&s;tance of five
leagues, and, when the &s;un &s;hines above it, ex|hibits
a beautiful rainbow. Below this cataract
the whirlpools and commotions of the waters
are &s;o tremendous, as to render navigation im|practicable
for &s;ix miles; and above it, the ri|ver
is much narrower than higher up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</NOTE>. Char|levoix<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 353.</NOTE>
de&s;cribes it in the following manner:</P>
<P>'My fir&s;t care, after my arrival, was to vi&s;it
the noble&s;t ca&s;cade, perhaps, in the world; but
I pre&s;ently found the Baron de la Hontan had
committed &s;uch a mi&s;take with re&s;pect to its
height and figure, as to give grounds to believe
he had never &s;een it. It is certain, that, if you
mea&s;ure its height by that of the three moun|tains
you are obliged to climb to get at it, it
does not come much &s;hort of what the map of
M. De&s;li&s;le makes it, that is, 600 feet, having
certainly gone into this paradox, either on the
faith of the Baron de la Hontan, or Father
Hennepin. But after I arrived at the &s;ummit
of the third mountain, I ob&s;erved, that, in the
&s;pace of three leagues, which I had to walk
before I came to this piece of water, though
you are &s;ometimes obliged to a&s;cend, you mu&s;t
yet de&s;cend &s;till more, a circum&s;tance to which
travellers &s;eem not to have &s;ufficiently attend|ed.
As it is impo&s;&s;ible to approach it but on
<PB N="281" REF="316">
one &s;ide only, and con&s;equently to &s;ee it, ex|cepting
in profile, or &s;ideways; it is no ea&s;y
matter to mea&s;ure its height with in&s;truments.
It, has, however, been attempted by means of
a pole tied to a long line, and, after many re|peated
trials, it has been found only 115, or
120 feet high. But it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;ure
that the pole has not been &s;topt by &s;ome pro|jecting
rock; for, though it was always drawn
up wet, as well as the end of the line to which
it was tied, this proves nothing at all, as the
water which precipitates it&s;elf from the moun|tain,
ri&s;es very high in foam. For my own
part, after having examined it on all &s;ides,
where it could be viewed to the greate&s;t ad|vantage,
I am inclined to think we cannot al|low
it le&s;s than a hundred and forty, or fifty
feet.'</P>
<P>'As to its figure, it is in the &s;hape of a hor&s;e|&s;hoe,
and is about 400 paces in circumference;
it is divided into two, exactly in the middle,
by a very narrow i&s;land, half a quarter of a
league long. It is true, tho&s;e two parts very
&s;oon unite; that on my &s;ide, and which I could
only have a &s;ide view of, has &s;everal branches
which project from the body of the ca&s;cade,
but that which I viewed in front, appeared to
me quite entire. The Baron de la Hontan
mentions a torrent, which, if this author has
not invented it, mu&s;t certainly fall through
&s;ome channel on the melting of the &s;nows.'</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="317">
Three leagues from Albany, in the province
of New York, there is a cataract of 50 feet per|pendicular
height, the vapour of which gives
ri&s;e al&s;o to a rainbow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. Abridg. vol. 6. part 2. p. 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In every country where the number of men
is too incon&s;iderable for forming and &s;upporting
poli&s;hed &s;ocieties, the &s;urface of the earth is more
unequal and rugged, and the channels of rivers
are more extended, irregular, and often in|terrupted
by cataracts. The Rhone and the
Loire would require the operation of &s;everal
ages before they became navigable. It is by
con&s;ining and directing the waters, and clearing
the bottoms of rivers, that they acquire a fixed
and determinate cour&s;e. In thinly inhabited
regions, nature is always rude, and &s;ometimes
deformed.</P>
<P>Some rivers lo&s;e them&s;elves in the &s;ands, and
others &s;eem to precipitate into the bowels of the
earth. The Guadalquiver in Spain, the river of
Gottenburg in Sweden, and even the Rhine,
di&s;appear under ground. It is affirmed, that, in
the we&s;t part of the i&s;land of St Domingo, there
is a pretty high mountain, at the foot of which
are &s;everal large caverns, that receive the rivers
and brooks; and the noi&s;e of their fall is heard
at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight leagues<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 43.</NOTE>. The
number of rivers, however, that di&s;appear in the
earth, is very &s;mall; and they &s;eem not to de|&s;cend
<PB N="283" REF="318">
very deep. It is more probable, that, like
the Rhine, they lo&s;e them&s;elves by dividing and
di&s;per&s;ing through a large &s;urface of &s;and, which
is very common with tho&s;e &s;mall rivers that run
through dry and &s;andy ground, of which there
are many examples in Africa, Per&s;ia, Arabia,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The rivers of the north carry down to the
&s;ea prodigious quantities of ice, which, by accu|mulating,
form tho&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es, &s;o dan|gerous
to the mariner. The &s;traits of Waigat,
which is frozen during the greate&s;t part of the
year, is mo&s;t remarkable for the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of ice,
which are con&s;tantly brought into the &s;traits by
the river Oby. They attach them&s;elves all a|long
the coa&s;ts, and ri&s;e to great heights. The
middle of the &s;trait freezes la&s;t, and the ice, of
cour&s;e, does not ri&s;e &s;o high as on each &s;ide.
When the north wind cea&s;es, and it blows in the
direction of the &s;traits, the ice begins to melt and
to break in the middle; then large ma&s;&s;es are
detached, and tran&s;ported into the open &s;ea.
The wind, which blows during the whole win|ter
from the north, over the frozen country of
Nova Zembla, renders the regions watered by
the Oby, and all Siberia, &s;o cold, that, at Tobol|&s;ki,
in the 57th degree, there are no fruit trees,
though at Stockholm in Sweden, and even in
higher latitudes, they have fruit trees and legu|minous
plants. This difference proceeds not,
as has been imagined, from the &s;ea of Lapland
<PB N="284" REF="319">
being colder than that of the &s;traits, nor from
the country of Nova Zembla being colder than
that of Lapland, but from this circum&s;tance alone,
that the Baltic and the &s;ea of Bothnia &s;often the
rigour of the north wind; whereas, in Siberia,
there is nothing to check its activity. This &s;o|lution
is a re&s;ult of experience. The cold is
never &s;o inten&s;e near the &s;ea coa&s;ts as in the in|terior
parts of a country. There are plants
which endure the open air all winter at London,
which cannot be pre&s;erved at Paris: And Sibe|ria,
which is a va&s;t continent, is, for this rea&s;on,
colder than Sweden, which is almo&s;t &s;urround|ed
with the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Spitzbergen is the colde&s;t country in the
world: It runs as far as the 78th degree of north
latitude, and is compo&s;ed of &s;mall, pointed
mountains. The&s;e mountains con&s;i&s;t of gravel,
and of flat &s;tones, like gray &s;late, heaped upon
one another. According to the accounts of voy|agers,
the&s;e hills are rai&s;ed by the winds, and
new ones appear every &s;ea&s;on. In this country
no quadrupeds live but the rein-deer, which
feeds upon mo&s;s. Beyond the&s;e hills, and a|bove
a league from the &s;ea, the ma&s;t of a &s;hip
was lately found with a pully fixed to one end
of it; from which circum&s;tance, it has been
concluded, that this is a new country, and that
it was formerly covered with the &s;ea: It is un|inhabited
and uninhabitable; for the hills have
no con&s;i&s;tence, but are loo&s;e and moveable; and
<PB N="285" REF="320">
a vapour proceeds from the earth, &s;o cold and
penetrating, as to preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of re|maining
any time upon this dreary and inho&s;|pitable
land.</P>
<P>The whale-fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els arrive at Spitzber|gen
in July, and depart from it about the mid|dle
of Augu&s;t, the ice not permitting them
to arrive &s;ooner, or to remain longer. In the&s;e
&s;eas there are prodigious boards of ice, clear and
&s;hining as gla&s;s, and from 60 to 80 fathom
thick; and, in &s;ome places, the &s;ea appears to
be frozen to the bottom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See recueil des voyages du Nord, tom. 1. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;eas of North America are likewi&s;e much
infe&s;ted with ice, as in A&s;cen&s;ion-bay, in Hud|&s;on's,
Cumberland's, Davis's, and Frobi&s;her's
&s;traits, &amp;c. We are a&s;&s;ured by Robert Lade,
that the mountains of Frie&s;land are entirely co|vered
with &s;now; and that the ice &s;urrounds the
coa&s;ts, and, like a bulwark, prevents all approach
to them. 'It is remarkable,' &s;ays he, 'that, in
this &s;ea, we meet with i&s;lands of ice, more than
half a league in circumference, exceedingly
high, and that de&s;cend from 70 to 80 fathoms
deep. This ice, which is &s;weet, is perhaps o|riginally
formed in the rivers or &s;traits of the
adjacent lands, &amp;c. The&s;e i&s;lands or moun|tains
of ice are moveable, and , in &s;torms, they
follow the tract of a &s;hip, as if they were
drawn after her by a rope. Some of them
<PB N="286" REF="321">
ri&s;e &s;o high above water, that they &s;urmount
the tops of the talle&s;t ma&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lade's voyages.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the voyages collected for the u&s;e of the
Dutch Ea&s;t India Company, we have the fol|lowing
account of the ice off Nova Zembla:
'At Cape Troo&s;t, the weather was &s;o foggy, as
to oblige us to moor our ve&s;&s;el to a bank of
ice, which was 36 fathoms below, and 16 a|bove
the &s;urface of the water. On the 10th
of Augu&s;t, the ice began to &s;eparate, and to
float; we then remarked, that the ma&s;s to
which our ve&s;&s;el had been moored, touched
the bottom; for, though the others were all
in motion, and &s;truck again&s;t it, and again&s;t
each other, it remained immoveable. We
were now afraid of being frozen in, or da&s;hed
to pieces by the ice; we, therefore, endeavour|ed
to e&s;cape from this latitude, though the ve&s;|&s;el,
in her cour&s;e, was obliged to pu&s;h through
the ice, which made a great noi&s;e round us for
a con&s;iderable di&s;tance: We at la&s;t anchored
along another board of ice, where we remain|ed
that night.'</P>
<P>'During the fir&s;t watch, the ice began to
&s;plit, with an inconceivable noi&s;e. The &s;hip's
head kept &s;o &s;trongly to the current in which
the ice-boards floated, that we were obliged to
veer the cable in order to get her off. We
counted above 400 blocks of ice, which &s;ank
<PB N="287" REF="322">
10 fathoms below the water, and appeared to
ri&s;e about 2 fathoms above it.'</P>
<P>'We then moored the ve&s;&s;el to another block
of ice, which was immer&s;ed below the &s;urface
about &s;ix fathoms. At a little di&s;tance from
this &s;tation we perceived a large bank, which
was pointed like a cone, and reached to the
bottom of the &s;ea: We approached it, and
found it to be 20 fathoms below, and about
12 above the &s;urface of the water.'</P>
<P>'On the 11th, we &s;ailed up to another bank,
which was 18 fathoms below the &s;urface, and
10 fathoms above it.'</P>
<P>'The Dutch, on the 21&s;t, advanced a great way
between the boards of ice, and anchored during
the night. Next morning they retired, and
moored to a bank which was 18 fathoms below,
and 10 above the water. They climbed to
the top, and remarked, as a &s;ingular phaeno|menon,
that it was covered with earth, and
that they found there about 40 eggs. Its
colour was a fine azure blue, and totally diffe|rent
from that of the other ma&s;&s;es. This cir|cum&s;tance
gave ri&s;e to various &s;peculations;
&s;ome imagining it to be an effect of the ice,
and others thought the whole was a ma&s;s of
frozen earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Troi&s;ieme voyage des Hollandois par le Nord, tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 46.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Wafer met with many floating pieces of ice
off Terra del Fuego, which were &s;o large that
<PB N="288" REF="323">
he at fir&s;t imagined them to be i&s;lands: Some
of them, he remarks, appeared to be a league or
two in length, and the large&s;t of them &s;eemed to
ri&s;e 400 or 500 feet above the &s;urface of the
water.</P>
<P>All the&s;e boards of ice, as I have remarked in
the 6th Article, are tran&s;ported from the rivers
into the &s;ea. Tho&s;e in the &s;ea of Nova Zembla
and in the Straits of Waigat, come from the
Oby, and, perhaps, from the Jeni&s;ca, and
other great rivers in Siberia and Tartary;
tho&s;e of the Hud&s;on's Straits, from A&s;cen|&s;ion-bay,
into which many rivers in North A|merica
empty them&s;elves; and tho&s;e of Terra
del Fuego, from the &s;outhern continent. If
fewer of them appear in the northern coa&s;ts of
Lapland than in tho&s;e of Siberia and Waigat's
Straits, it is becau&s;e all the Lapland rivers fall
into the gulf of Bothnia, and none of them in|to
the north &s;ea. They may likewi&s;e be formed
in &s;traits, where the tides ri&s;e higher than in the
open &s;ea; and, con&s;equently, where the boards
of ice that float on the &s;urface may accumulate
and produce ma&s;&s;es or banks of &s;everal fathoms
high. But, with regard to tho&s;e which ri&s;e to
the height of four or five hundred feet, it ap|pears,
that they can no where be produced but
near very elevated coa&s;ts; and I imagine, that,
when the &s;nows which cover the&s;e coa&s;ts melt,
the water runs down upon the boards of ice,
and, by freezing anew, gradually augment their
<PB N="289" REF="324">
&s;ize, till they arrive at this amazing height;
that, in a warm &s;ummer, the action of the winds,
the agitation of the &s;ea, and perhaps their own
weight, may detach them from the coa&s;ts, and
&s;et them adrift; and that they may even be
tran&s;ported into temperate climates before they
are entirely di&s;&s;olved.</P>

<P>THE dry land is every where &s;urrounded
by the ocean: It penetrates, &s;ometimes by
large openings, and &s;ometimes by &s;mall &s;traits,
into the interior parts of different countries; and
it forms mediterranean &s;eas, &s;ome of which are
affected by the motion of the tides, and others
not. We &s;hall, in this article, trace the ocean
through all its windings; and, at the &s;ame time,
give an enumeration of all the mediterranean
&s;eas, which we &s;hall endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h
from what are called bays or gulfs, and lakes.</P>
<P>The &s;ea that wa&s;hes the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of
France, forms a gulf between Spain and Bri|tain.
This gulf is, by navigators, called the Bay
<PB N="291" REF="326">
of Bi&s;cay: It is very open, and advances far|the&s;t
into the land between Bayonne and St Se|ba&s;tian.
It likewi&s;e advances con&s;iderably at
Rochelle and Rochefort. This bay begins at
Cape Ortegal, and terminates at Bre&s;t, where a
&s;trait commences between the &s;outh point of
Britain and Cape Lizard. This &s;trait, which is
at fir&s;t pretty wide, forms a &s;mall bay on the
coa&s;t of Normandy, the mo&s;t advanced point of
which is at Auranche. It continues pretty large
till it arrives at the channel of Calais, where it
is very narrow; it then &s;uddenly enlarges, and
terminates between the Texel and the coa&s;t of
Norwich: At the Texel, it forms a &s;mall &s;hallow
mediterranean called <HI>Zuider&s;ee,</HI> and &s;everal large
gaps or advances, who&s;e waters are not of a con|&s;iderable
depth.</P>
<P>After this, the ocean forms a large bay called
the <HI>German Sea,</HI> which commences at the north|mo&s;t
point of Scotland, and runs along the ea&s;t
coa&s;t of Britain the length of Norwich; and
from thence to the Texel, along the coa&s;ts of
Holland and Germany, of Jutland and Norway,
as far as Bergen. This bay may even be con|&s;idered
as a mediterranean; for the Orkney
i&s;lands nearly &s;hut up its mouth, and &s;eem, by
their direction, to be a continuation of the moun|tains
of Norway. It forms a large &s;trait, which
commences at the &s;outh point of Norway, and
continues pretty broad to the i&s;land of Zetland,
where it &s;uddenly contracts, and forms, between
<PB N="292" REF="327">
the coa&s;ts of Sweden and the i&s;lands of Denmark
and Jutland, four &s;mall &s;traits; after which, it
widens to a &s;mall bay, the mo&s;t advanced point
of which is at Lubec; from thence, to the &s;outh
extremity of Sweden, it continues pretty broad;
then it enlarges more and more, and forms the
Baltic, which is a mediterranean &s;ea, extending,
from &s;outh to north, near 300 leagues, if the
gulph of Bothnia, which, in effect, is a continu|ation
of it, be comprehended. In the Baltic are
two bays, that of Livonia, the mo&s;t advanced
point of which is near Mittau and Riga, and
that of Finland, which is a branch of the Baltic,
extending between Livonia and Finland to Pe|ter&s;burgh,
and communicating with lake Ladoga,
and even with lake Onega, which joins the white
&s;ea by means of the river Onega. The whole
body of water which forms the Baltic, the Gulfs
of Bothnia, of Finland, and of Livonia, ought
to be regarded as an immen&s;e lake, &s;upported by
a great number of rivers, as the Oder, the Vi|&s;tula,
the Niemen, the Droine in Germany and
Poland; by other rivers in Livonia and Finland,
by others &s;till more con&s;iderable that come from
Lapland, as the Tornea, the Calis, the Lula, the
Pithea, the Uma; and by &s;everal from Sweden.
The&s;e rivers, which in general are large, amount
in all to more than 40, computing tho&s;e which
fall into them, and cannot fail to convey a quan|tity
of water &s;ufficient to &s;upply the Baltic. Be|&s;ides,
there are no tides in the Baltic, and its
<PB N="293" REF="328">
water has very little faltne&s;s: And, if the &s;itua|tion
of the land, and the number of lakes and
mar&s;hes in Finland and Sweden, which are con|tiguous
to the Baltic, be taken into con&s;ideration,
we &s;hall be inclined to regard it not as a &s;ea, but
as a great lake formed by the waters which it
receives from the adjacent countries, and which
have forced for them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age near Den|mark
into the ocean, into which, according to
the relation of voyagers, it &s;till continues to run.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the bay which
goes by the name of the German Sea, and which
terminates beyond Bergen, the ocean follows
the coa&s;ts of Norway, Swedi&s;h Lapland, North
Lapland, and Mu&s;covite Lapland, at the ea&s;tern
part of which it forms a large &s;trait, and gives
ri&s;e to the mediterranean called the White Sea,
which may al&s;o be con&s;idered as a great lake;
for it receives twelve or thirteen large rivers,
which are more than &s;ufficient to &s;upply it with
water; and its water contains but little &s;alt.
Be&s;ides, it is within a trifle, in &s;everal places, of
communicating with the Baltic; and it has an
evident communication with the gulf of Fin|land;
for, in a&s;cending the river Onega, we
arrive at a lake of the &s;ame name, which is
joined by two rivers to lake Ladoga; and this
la&s;t communicates by a large branch with the
gulf of Finland; and there are, in Swedi&s;h
Lapland, &s;everal places from which the waters
run almo&s;t indifferently either into the White
<PB N="294" REF="329">
Sea, or into the gulfs of Bothnia and of Fin|land.
This whole country being full of lakes
and mar&s;hes, it, therefore, &s;eems probable, that
the Baltic and White Seas were the receptacles
of its waters, and that, in time, they di&s;charged
them&s;elves into the German and Frozen &s;eas.</P>
<P>On leaving the White Sea, and coa&s;ting the
i&s;land of Candenos, and the north of Ru&s;&s;ia, the
ocean advances a &s;mall arm into the land at the
mouth of the river Petzora. This arm, which
is about 40 leagues in length, by 8 or 10 in
breadth, may rather be regarded as a collection
of water formed by the river, than as a gulf of
the &s;ea; and it al&s;o contains very little &s;alt. In
this place the land runs out in a promontory
terminated by the &s;mall i&s;lands of Maurice and
of Orange, and between this promontory and
the neighbouring land to the &s;outh of Waigat's
&s;traits, there is a bay of about 30 leagues long,
which belongs to the ocean, and is not formed
by rivers. This is &s;ucceeded by Waigat's &s;traits,
which lies nearly under the 70th degree of
north latitude; it is not above 8 or 10 leagues
in length, and it communicates with the &s;ea
which wa&s;hes the north coa&s;ts of Siberia. As
this &s;trait is blocked up with ice during the
greate&s;t part of the year, it is very difficult to
penetrate into the &s;ea beyond it. This pa&s;&s;age
has been tried in vain by many navigators; and
tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded have not given us exact
charts of this &s;ea, which they call the Pacific
<PB N="295" REF="330">
Sea. By the mo&s;t recent charts, and by the
be&s;t globes, it appears, that this &s;ea may be only
a mediterranean, having no connection with the
great &s;ea of Tartary; for it &s;eems to be &s;hut up
and bounded to the &s;outh by the country of the
Samoides, which is now well known, and which
extends from the Straits of Waigat to the mouth
of the river Jeni&s;ca: To the ea&s;t, it is bounded
by Jelmorland; to the we&s;t by Nova Zembla;
and, though we know not the extent of this
&s;ea to the north and north-ea&s;t, as the land &s;eems
not to be interrupted, it is probable that the Pa|cific
Sea is only a mediterranean; and that it is
bounded by land, and has no communication on
that &s;ide with the ocean. What e&s;tabli&s;hes this
fact is, that, in departing from the Straits of
Waigat, the whole we&s;t and north coa&s;ts of No|va
Zembla, the length of Cape De&s;ire, have been
traver&s;ed; that, from this Cape, the coa&s;ts of
Nova Zembla have been traced to a &s;mall bay
about the 75th degree, where &s;ome Dutchmen
pa&s;&s;ed a dreadful winter in 1596; and that, be|yond
this gulf, the land of Jelmorland was
di&s;covered in 1664, which is &s;eparated from Nova
Zembla only by a few leagues of land; &s;o that
the only land unknown is a &s;mall &s;pot near this
little bay ju&s;t now de&s;cribed; and this &s;pot ex|ceeds
not, perhaps, 30 leagues in length. If,
therefore, the Pacific Sea joins with the ea&s;tern
ocean, it mu&s;t be by means of this &s;mall bay,
which is the only way by which this mediter|ranean
<PB N="296" REF="331">
can have any communication with it.
And, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch a com|munication
exi&s;ted, as this bay lies in the 75th
degree of latitude, it would be nece&s;&s;ary, to gain
this open &s;ea, to keep five degrees farther north.
It is apparent, therefore, that, in attempting a
north pa&s;&s;age to China, it is better to &s;ail beyond
Nova Zembla to the 77th or 78th degree, where
the &s;ea is more open and clearer of ice, than to
per&s;i&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing the frozen &s;traits of Waigat,
when it is even uncertain whether the &s;ea be|yond
them has any communication with the
ea&s;tern ocean.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t has been traced from Nova Zem|bla
and Jelmorland to the mouth of the Chotan|ga,
which is about the 73d degree; beyond
which an unknow coa&s;t extends about 200
leagues. We only know, from the Ru&s;&s;ians
who travelled by land into the&s;e climates, that
the country is not interrupted; and, in their
charts, the rivers are delineated, and they called
the inhabitants <HI>Populi Palati.</HI> This interval of
unknown coa&s;t extends from the mouth of the
Chotanga to that of Kauvoina, in the 66th de|gree
of latitude. The bay of Linchidolin, in
which the Ru&s;&s;ians fi&s;h whales, advances far|the&s;t
into the land at the mouth of the Len,
which is a con&s;iderable river. This bay is very
open, and pertains to the &s;ea of Tartary.</P>
<P>From the mouth of the Len, the northern
coa&s;t of Tartary runs about 500 leagues ea&s;t|ward
<PB N="297" REF="332">
to a penin&s;ula inhabited by a people called
Schelates; it is the mo&s;t northern point of Tar|tary,
and lies under the 72d degree of latitude.
In this 500 leagues, the ocean forms neither
bays nor arms; only, from the penin&s;ula of the
Schelates, to the mouth of the Korvinea, the
coa&s;t has a con&s;iderable winding. This point is
the ea&s;tern extremity of the north coa&s;t of the
Old Continent, and Cape North in Lapland is the
we&s;tern extremity. Thus, we have of northern
coa&s;t, from Cape North in Lapland, to the extre|mity
of the country of the Schelates, an extent
of 1700 leagues, including the &s;inuo&s;ities of
bays; and it mea&s;ures about 1100 leagues in
a &s;traight line.</P>
<P>Let us next take a &s;urvey of the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts
of the Antient Continent, commencing at the
extreme point of the country of the Schelates,
and de&s;cending towards the equator. The ocean
fir&s;t makes a turn between the country of the
Schelates and that of the T&s;chut&s;chi, which la&s;t
projects con&s;iderably into the &s;ea. To the &s;outh
of this country, there is a &s;mall open bay, called
the bay of Suctoikret; this bay is &s;ucceeded by
another, which advances, like an arm, about 40
or 50 leagues into the land of Kamt&s;chatka:
After which the ocean flows in, by a narrow
&s;trait, full of &s;mall i&s;lands, between the &s;outhern
point of Kamt&s;chatka and the northern point
of the land of Je&s;&s;o, and forms a large medi|terranean,
which we &s;hall now de&s;cribe in de|tail.
<PB N="298" REF="333">
It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ea of Kamt&s;chatka, in
which there is a con&s;iderable i&s;land, called
the i&s;land of <HI>Amour.</HI> An arm of this &s;ea
runs north-ea&s;t. But, both this arm and the
&s;ea of Kamt&s;chatka may, at lea&s;t in part, be
formed by the waters from the rivers which
flow into it from the lands of Kamt&s;chatka, and
tho&s;e of Tartary. However this matter &s;tands,
the &s;ea of Kamt&s;chatka communications, by a very
long &s;trait, with the &s;ea of Corea, which is ano|ther
part of this mediterranean; and the whole
together, extending more than 600 leagues in
length, is bounded, on the we&s;t and north, by
the lands of Corea and Tartary; and, on the
ea&s;t and &s;outh, by tho&s;e of Kamt&s;chatka, Je&s;&s;o,
and Japan, without having any other communi|cation
with the ocean than by the &s;trait between
Kamt&s;chatka and Je&s;&s;o; for, it is uncertain
whether the communication between Japan and
the land of Je&s;&s;o, though laid down in &s;ome
charts, has a real exi&s;tence; and, even &s;uppo&s;ing
it did exi&s;t, the &s;ea of Kamt&s;chatka and that of
Corea would &s;till be regarded as forming toge|ther
a great mediterranean, &s;eparated on all
&s;ides from the ocean, and not as a bay; for it
communicates not with the ocean by its &s;outh|ern
&s;trait, but with the Chine&s;e Sea, which is
rather a mediterranean than a bay.</P>
<P>In the preeceding article, it was remarked, that
the &s;ea had a con&s;tant motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t;
and that, con&s;equently, the great Pacific Ocean
<PB N="299" REF="334">
is making continual efforts again&s;t the ea&s;tern
coa&s;ts. An accurate examination of the globe
will confirm the conclu&s;ions we have drawn
from this ob&s;ervation; for, it appears, that,
from Kamt&s;chatka to New Britain, di&s;covered
by Dampier in 1700, and which lies in the 4th
or 5th degree of &s;outh latitude, the ocean has
encroached on the&s;e coa&s;ts to the extent of 400
leagues; and, of cour&s;e, that the ea&s;tern bounds
of the Old Continent &s;tretch not &s;o far as they
did formerly; for, it is remarkable, that New
Britain and Kamt&s;chatka, which are the mo&s;t
advanced lands to the ea&s;t, lie under the &s;ame
meridian. Be&s;ides, all countries extend farthe&s;t
from north to &s;outh. Kamt&s;chatka makes a
point of about 160 leagues from north to &s;outh,
and this point, the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of which is
wa&s;hed by the Pacific Ocean, and the other by
the mediterranean above de&s;cribed, is divided
from north to &s;outh by a chain of mountains.
The lands of Japan and of Je&s;&s;o form another
territory between the ocean and the &s;ea of Co|rea,
extending from north to &s;outh more than
400 leagues; and the direction of the chains of
mountains in Je&s;&s;o and Japan mu&s;t be from
north to &s;outh; becau&s;e, in this direction, they
extend 400 leagues; but, from we&s;t to ea&s;t,
they exceed not 50 or 60. Thus, Kamt&s;chatka,
Je&s;&s;o, and the ea&s;tern part of Japan, ought to
be con&s;idered as contiguous lands, lying in a
direction from north to &s;outh: And, following
<PB N="300" REF="335">
the &s;ame direction, we find, after the point of
Cape Ava in Japan, the i&s;land of Barnevelt, and
three other i&s;lands, &s;ituated in a line from north
to &s;outh, and extending about 100 leagues.
We next meet with three i&s;lands, called Calla|nos,
and after the&s;e, the Ladrone i&s;lands, to the
number of 14 or 15, all &s;tretching in a line
from north to &s;outh, the whole occupying a
&s;pace of 300 leagues in length; and the broad|e&s;t
part of the&s;e i&s;lands, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, ex|ceeds
not 8 leagues. From the&s;e facts, I am
led to conclude, that Kamt&s;chatka, Je&s;&s;o, the
ea&s;t part of Japan, the i&s;lands of Barnevelt, the
Callanos, and the Ladrones, are a continuation
of the &s;ame chain of mountains, and the remains
of an antient country, which has been gradu|ally
corroded and covered with the &s;ea. All
the&s;e countries appear to be nothing but moun|tains,
of which the i&s;lands are the peaks or
points, the low-lands being occupied by the
ocean. What, therefore, is related in the <HI>Lettres
Ede&s;iantes</HI> is true; and, in fact, a number of
i&s;lands, called the New Philippines, has been
di&s;covered in the very &s;ituation that P. Gobien
&s;uppo&s;ed them to lie: And, it cannot be doubt|ed,
that the mo&s;t ea&s;terly of the&s;e New Philip|pines
are a continuation of the chain of moun|tains
which compo&s;e the Ladrones; for the&s;e
ea&s;tern i&s;lands, to the number of eleven, lie in
a line from north to the &s;outh, extending in
<PB N="301" REF="336">
length more than 200 leagues, and, in breadth,
the large&s;t of them exceeds not eight leagues.</P>
<P>But the&s;e conjectures may &s;eem to be bold,
on account of the great di&s;tances between the
i&s;lands in the neighbourhood of Cape Ava, of
Japan, and of the Callanos, between the&s;e i&s;lands
and the Ladrones, and between the Ladrones and
the New Philippines, the fir&s;t interval being
about 160 leagues, the &s;econd 50 or 60, and the
third near 120. But it ought to be con&s;idered,
that chains of mountains often extend much
farther below the waters of the ocean; and that
the&s;e intervals are nothing when compared to
the extent of land, from &s;outh to north, in the&s;e
i&s;lands or mountains, which, beginning at the
interior part of Kamt&s;chatka, is more than 1100
leagues. But, though this idea concerning the
quantity of land gained by the ocean on the
ea&s;tern parts of the Old Continent, and the con|tinuation
of the mountains, &s;hould be rejected,
&s;till it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that Kamt&s;chatka,
Je&s;&s;o, Japan, the i&s;lands of Rois, Formo&s;a, Vaif,
Ba&s;ha, Babuyane, Lucca, Mindano, Gilolo, &amp;c.
and, la&s;tly, New Guinea, which extends to New
Britain, and is &s;ituated under the &s;ame meridian
as Kamt&s;chatka, form a &s;tretch of country of
more than 2200 leagues, with &s;mall interrup|tions,
the greate&s;t of which exceeds not, per|haps,
20 leagues; &s;o that the ocean has &s;cooped
out an immen&s;e bay from the interior parts of
the ea&s;tern continent, which begins at Kamt|&s;chatka,
<PB N="302" REF="337">
and terminates at New Britain. This
bay is inter&s;per&s;ed with numerous i&s;lands, and
has all the appearances of being gained from
the land. It is, therefore, probable, that the
ocean, by its con&s;tant motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t,
has gradually gained this great tract of country
from the continent, and has formed &s;everal me|diterraneans,
as tho&s;e of Kamt&s;chatka, of Corea,
of China, and perhaps the whole Indian Archi|pelago;
for the land and the water are &s;o blen|ded
together in this region, that it evidently ap|pears
to have been a large country de&s;troyed by
inundations, of which only the eminences and
mountainous parts are now to be &s;een, the low|er
grounds being entirely concealed under the
waters of the ocean. This hypothe&s;is is farther
confirmed by the &s;hallowne&s;s of the &s;ea, and
the figures of the innumerable i&s;lands, which
&s;eem to be nothing but the tops of moun|tains.</P>
<P>If we take a more particular &s;urvey of the&s;e
&s;eas, we will find, that the northern part of the
Chine&s;e &s;ea forms it&s;elf into a great bay, which
begins at the i&s;land of Fungma, and terminates
at the frontiers of the province of Pekin, about
50 leagues from this capital of the Chine&s;e em|pire.
The mo&s;t advanced and narrowe&s;t part of
this bay is called the gulf of Changi. It is pro|bable
that this gulf, and part of the &s;ea of China,
are encroachments of the ocean, and that the
i&s;lands above de&s;cribed are the mo&s;t elevated
<PB N="303" REF="338">
parts of the antient country. Farther &s;outh are
the bays of Tonquin and of Siam, in the neigh|bourhood
of which is the penin&s;ula of Malacca,
con&s;i&s;ting of a long chain of mountains that run
from north to &s;outh; and the Andaman i&s;lands,
which form another chain of mountains, in the
&s;ame direction, &s;eem to be only a continuation
of the mountains of Sumatra.</P>
<P>After this the ocean forms the great bay of
Bengal; where it may be remarked, that the
land of the penin&s;ula of Indus makes a concave
curve, towards the ea&s;t, nearly re&s;embling the
great bay of the ea&s;tern continent, which &s;eems
to have been produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e, name|ly,
the motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t. In
this penin&s;ula are the mountains of Gates, which
extend from north to &s;outh; and the i&s;land of
Ceylon appears to have been &s;eparated from this
part of the continent.</P>
<P>The Maldiva i&s;lands are nothing but another
chain of mountains &s;tretching from north to
&s;outh. Then follows the Arabian gulph, which
&s;ends off four branches or arms; the two large&s;t
are on the we&s;t coa&s;t, and the two &s;malle&s;t on the
ea&s;t. The fir&s;t arm on the ea&s;t coa&s;t is the bay
of Cambaia, which extends not above 50 or 60
leagues; but it receives two con&s;iderable rivers,
the Tapta and the Baroche or Mehi. The &s;e|cond
arm or bay on the &s;ame coa&s;t is remark|able
for the rapidity and height of its tides,
which alternately advance and retreat more than
<PB N="304" REF="339">
50 leagues. Into this bay fall &s;everal rivers, as
the Indus, the Padar, &amp;c. which have brought
down &s;and and mud in &s;uch quantities as to ele|vate
the bottom of the bay, and reduce it nearly
to a perfect level. It is owing to this circum|&s;tance
that the tides extend to &s;o great a di&s;tance.
The fir&s;t arm on the we&s;t coa&s;t is the Per&s;ic
gulf, which advances into the land above 250
leagues; and the &s;econd is the Red Sea, which,
reckoning from the i&s;land of Socotora, extends
above 680 leagues. From the &s;traits of Ormuz
and of Babelmandel, the&s;e two arms &s;hould be
con&s;idered as mediterranean &s;eas: They are
both, indeed affected with the tides; but this is
occa&s;ioned by their vicinity to the equator,
where the tides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> higher than in other climates.
Be&s;ides, they are both very long and very nar|row.
The motion of the tides is more rapid in
the Red Sea than in the Per&s;ic gulf; becau&s;e the
former is nearly three times as long, and equally
narrow, as the latter; neither does it receive
any river capable of re&s;i&s;ting the tide: But the
Per&s;ic gulf receives three large rivers at its mo&s;t
advanced extremity. It is apparent, that the
Red Sea has been formed by an irruption of the
ocean; for the &s;ituation and &s;imilarity in the
direction of the coa&s;ts on each &s;ide of the &s;traits
of Babelmandel demon&s;trate, that this pa&s;&s;age
has been cut by the waters.</P>
<P>At the extremity of the Red Sea lies that fa|mous
&s;trip of land called the I&s;thmus of Suez,
<PB N="305" REF="340">
which is a barrier to the junction of the Red
Sea with the Mediterranean. In the preceding
article, I gave the rea&s;ons which render it pro|bable
that the Red Sea is higher than the Me|diterranean,
and that, if the I&s;thmus were cut,
an inundation and increa&s;e of the latter would
be the con&s;equence. It may here be added,
that, though the &s;uperior elevation of the Red
Sea &s;hould not be allowed, yet, that there are no
tides in the Mediterranean near the mouths of
the Nile, is an unconte&s;tible fact. It is equally
certain, that the tides in the Red Sea ri&s;e &s;everal
feet; and this circum&s;tance alone, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition
of the removal of the I&s;thmus, would oc|ca&s;ion
a great influx of water from the Red Sea
into the Mediterranean. Be&s;ides, Varenius, in
his geography<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 100.</NOTE>, remarks, 'Oceanus Germa|nicus,

ocean, therefore, is higher than the &s;ea of Hol|land,
there is nothing to prevent us from be|lieving
that the Red Sea may be higher than the
Mediterranean. Herodotus and Diodorus Si|culus
mention a canal of communication be|tween
the Nile, the Mediterranean, and the Red
Sea: And M. de l'I&s;le, in 1704, publi&s;hed a
map, in which he has laid down the termination
of a canal in the ea&s;t branch of the Nile, which
he imagined to be a part of that which former|ly
joined that river to the Red Sea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e, 1704.</NOTE> We meet
<PB N="307" REF="342">
with the &s;ame opinion in a book entitled <HI>Con|noi&s;&s;ance
de l'Ancien Monde</HI>; where the author,
copying Diodorus Siculus, farther informs us,
that this canal was begun by Neco King of
Egypt; that Darius King of Per&s;ia continued
the work; that it was fini&s;hed by Ptolomy II.
who conducted it to the city of Ar&s;inoa; and
that it could be &s;hut and opened at plea&s;ure. I
pretend not to deny the&s;e facts; but, I confe&s;s,
they appear to be doubtful. I &s;u&s;pect, that the
violence and height of the tides, in the Red Sea,
would nece&s;&s;arily produce and communicate
their influence to the waters of the canal: At
lea&s;t, it would require great precaution to pre|vent
inundations, and to keep the canal in pro|per
repair. Though we are told by hi&s;torians
that this canal was begun and fini&s;hed, they are
&s;ilent as to its duration; and the remains of it,
which are pretended &s;till to exi&s;t, are perhaps
all that was ever executed. This branch of the
ocean has been denominated the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> be|cau&s;e,
wherever there are madrepores or corals
at the bottom, the water of it has the appearance
of this colour. The following de&s;cription of it
is given in the <HI>Hi&s;toire Generale des Voyages</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 198.</NOTE>:
'Before leaving the Red Sea, D. Jean inquired
into the cau&s;es which induced the antients to
give it this appellation: He recollected, that
Pliny had delivered &s;everal opinions concer|ning
the origin of this name. Some derived it
<PB N="308" REF="343">
from a King of that country called <HI>Erythros,</HI>
which, in the Greek language, &s;ignifies <HI>Red</HI>:
Others imagined that the red colour was occa|&s;ioned
by the reflection of the &s;un from the
&s;urface of the water; and others affirmed the
water it&s;elf to be red. The Portugue&s;e, who
had made &s;everal voyages in that &s;ea, alledged,
that the whole coa&s;t of Arabia was remarkably
red; and that the du&s;t and &s;and carried into
the &s;ea by the winds tinged the water with the
&s;ame colour.'</P>
<P>'Dom Jean, who examined the nature of the
water and of the coa&s;ts, through their whole
extent, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention, a&s;|&s;ures
us, that the waters of this &s;ea have no
peculiarity in their colour, and that the du&s;t
and &s;and, not being red them&s;elves, could not
po&s;&s;ibly communicate this colour to the water.
The land on each &s;ide, he ob&s;erves, is gene|rally
brown; in &s;ome places, it is black, and,
in others, white: At Suaquem, the coa&s;ts of
which the Portugue&s;e never vi&s;ited, there are
three mountains &s;triped with red; but they
con&s;i&s;t of hard rocks, and the neighbouring
ground is of the u&s;ual colour.'</P>
<P>'The truth is, that this &s;ea is all of the &s;ame
uniform colour, of which any man may &s;atis|fy
him&s;elf by drawing water from different
parts. But, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, in
&s;ome places, it appears, by accident, to be red,
and, in others, green and white. This phae|nomenon
<PB N="309" REF="344">
admits of the following explication.
From Suaquem to Ko&s;&s;ir, which is an extent of
136 leagues, the &s;ea is filled with banks and
rocks of coral; they are &s;o called from their
re&s;embling coral in form and colour &s;o exact|ly,
that it is difficult to perceive the di&s;tinction:
There are two kinds of them, the one is white,
and the other extremely red. In many places,
they are covered with a kind of gum, or vi&s;cid
&s;ub&s;tance, of a green colour, and &s;ometimes of
a deep orange. Now the water of this &s;ea is
&s;o tran&s;parent, that the bottom is vi&s;ible at the
depth of twenty fathoms, e&s;pecially from
Suaquem to the extremity of the gulf; and
hence the water a&s;&s;umes, in appearance, the co|lour
of the bodies which it covers. When,
for example, the rocks are overlaid with a
green gum, the water abover them appears to
be green; when the bottom is &s;and alone, the
&s;uperincumbent water &s;eems to be white; and,
when the rocks are covered with coral, the
water above them appears to be reddi&s;h. But,
as the rocks of this colour are more frequent
than the green or white, Dom Jean concludes,
that the Arabic Gulf has, from this circum|&s;tance,
obtained the name of the Red Sea.
He was the more &s;atisfied with this di&s;covery,
becau&s;e the method he employed in the inve|&s;tigation
of it left no room for he&s;itation or
doubt. In &s;uch places as were not deep e|nough
to allow his ve&s;&s;el to &s;ail, he fa&s;tened
<PB N="310" REF="345">
pinks oppo&s;ite to the rocks; and the &s;ailors
were enabled to execute his orders, at more
than half a league from the rocks, without be|ing
immer&s;ed above the middle of their bodies.
In tho&s;e places where the water appeared red,
the greate&s;t part of the &s;tones and pebbles they
brought up were of the &s;ame colour; where
the water appeared green, the &s;tones were
green al&s;o; and where the water appeared
white, the bottom was a pure white &s;and.'</P>
<P>From the entrance to the Red Sea, at Cape
Gardafu, to the Cape of Good Hope, the direc|tion
of the coa&s;t is pretty equal, and the &s;ea
forms no bays of any note. There is, indeed, a
&s;mall &s;coop on the coa&s;t of Melinda, which, if
the I&s;land of Madaga&s;car were united to the
continent, might be con&s;idered as a part of a
large bay. This i&s;land, it is true, though &s;epa|rated
by the &s;traits of Mozambigue, appears to
have formerly belonged to the continent; for,
in this &s;trait, there are deep &s;ands of great ex|tent,
e&s;pecially on the Madaga&s;car coa&s;t, which
make the open part of it very narrow.</P>
<P>From the Cape of Good Hope to Cape
Negro, on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Africa, the land lies
in the &s;ame direction; and the whole of it
&s;eems to be a chain of mountains: It is, at lea&s;t,
a very elevated country, and, though more than
500 leagues in length, it it is furni&s;hed with no
rivers of any con&s;ideration, excepting one or
two, which are, known no farther than their
<PB N="311" REF="346">
mouths. But the coa&s;ts, above Cape Negro,
makes a large curve; and the land, along this
curve, appears to be lower than that of the re&s;t
of Africa: It is watered by &s;everal great rivers,
the large&s;t of which are the Coanza and the
Zaire. From Cape Negro to Cape Gon&s;alvez,
are the mouths of 24 con&s;iderable rivers; and
the &s;pace between the&s;e two capes, reckoning
along the &s;hore, is about 420 leagues. We
would be tempted to think, that the ocean has
encroached on the&s;e low lands of Africa, not by
its natural motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t, which could
have no influence in producing this effect, but
by the facility with which it might have under|mined
and &s;urmounted them. From Cape Gon|&s;alvez
to Cape Trois-pointes, the ocean forms
an open bay, which pre&s;ents nothing remark|able,
excepting a very advanced point nearly in
the middle of it, called <HI>Cape Formo&s;a</HI>: It like|wi&s;e
contains, in the &s;outhern part of it, the
i&s;lands of Fernandpo, St Thomas, and Prince's
I&s;land. The&s;e i&s;lands appear to be a continua|tion
of a chain of mountains &s;ituated between
Rie del Rey, and the river Jamoer. From Cape
Trois-pointes to Cape Palmas, the ocean runs
a little in upon the land; and from Cape
Palmas to Cape Tagrin, there is nothing wor|thy
of remark. But, beyond Cape Tagrin,
there is a &s;mall bay in the country of Sierra-Leona;
and a little farther, there is another, in
which are &s;ituated the i&s;lands of Bi&s;agas. After
<PB N="312" REF="347">
this we meet with Cape Verd, which projects far
into the &s;ea, and of which the i&s;lands of the &s;ame
name appear to be a continuation; or, rather,
they &s;eem to be a continuation of Cape Blanc,
which is a more elevated country, and &s;tretches
&s;till farther into the ocean. We next come to
a mountainous and dry coa&s;t, which commences
at Cape Blanc, and terminates at Cape Bajador:
The Canary i&s;lands &s;eem to be a continuation of
the&s;e mountains. La&s;tly, between Africa and
Portugal, is a large open bay, in the middle of
which are the celebrated &s;traits of Gibraltar.
The ocean pours its waters, with great rapidity,
through this &s;trait into the Mediterranean. This
&s;ea runs into the interior parts of the land near
900 leagues, and gives ri&s;e to many objects
worthy of remark. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It has no tides that are
perceptible, excepting in the Gulf of Venice;
and a &s;mall flux and reflux have been alledged to
take place at Mar&s;eilles and on the coa&s;t of Tri|poli.
2<HI>d,</HI> It contains many large i&s;lands, as
Sicily, Sardinia, Cor&s;ica, Cyprus, Majorca, &amp;c.
and Italy, which is one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
penin&s;ula's in the world: It is likewi&s;e adorned
with a rich Archipelago, or rather, it is from the
Mediterranean Archipelago that all other collec|tions
of i&s;lands have acquired that appellation.
But this Archipelago appears to belong more
properly to the Black Sea than to the Mediter|ranean;
and it is probable, that the country of
Greece was partly covered with the Black Sea,
<PB N="313" REF="348">
which runs into the &s;ea of Marmora, and from
that into the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that a double current
runs through the Straits of Gibraltar; one &s;upe|rior,
which carries the water from the ocean in|to
the Mediterranean, and another inferior,
which carries the waters from the Mediterrane|an
back to the ocean. But this notion is fal&s;e,
and contrary to the known laws of hydro&s;tatics.
The&s;e oppo&s;ite currents have been a&s;cribed to
&s;everal other &s;traits, as the Bo&s;phorus, the &s;traits
of the Sund, &amp;c.; and Mar&s;illi has related ma|ny
experiments tending to prove the exi&s;tence
of a &s;uperior and inferior current in the Bo&s;|phorus.
The&s;e experiments, however, mu&s;t
have been fallacious; for &s;uch a phaenomenon
is repugnant to the nature and motion of fluids.
Be&s;ide, Greaves, in his <HI>Pyramidographie,</HI> has de|mon&s;trated,
by accurate experiments, that there
are no oppo&s;ite currents in the Bo&s;phorus. Mar|&s;illi
and others may have been deceived by the
regorging of the water near the &s;hores, which
takes place in the Bo&s;phorus, in the &s;traits of
Gibraltar, and in all rapid rivers, and which oft|en
produces a motion oppo&s;ite to that of the
principal current.</P>
<P>Let us now briefly run over the coa&s;ts of the
New Continent. We &s;hall begin with Cape
Hold-with-hope, which is &s;ituated in the 73d
degree of North Latitude. This is the mo&s;t
northerly point of land in New Greenland, and
<PB N="314" REF="349">
is di&s;tant from Cape North in Lapland about
160 or 180 leagues. From this cape the coa&s;t
of Greenland might be traced to the polar circle,
where the ocean forms a large &s;trait between
Iceland and Greenland. Some maintain, that
this country in the neighbourhood of Iceland is
not the Antient Greenland, formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the Danes as a province dependent on that
kingdom; its inhabitants were civilized Chri&s;ti|ans,
who had bi&s;hops, churches, and a number
of towns proportioned to their trade. The Danes
had a communication with them as ea&s;y, and as
frequent, as the Spaniards with the Canary
i&s;lands: There &s;till exi&s;ts, it is &s;aid, laws and
regulations re&s;pecting the government of this
province, and the&s;e not of a very antient date.
However, without forming any conjectures how
this country came to be ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, we find
not, in New Greenland, the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of what
is here related. They are mere &s;avages: They
have no buildings: There is not a word in their
language that has the &s;malle&s;t affinity to the
Dani&s;h tongue; and there is not a &s;ingle cir|cum&s;tance
from which we can infer it to be the
&s;ame country. It is even almo&s;t a de&s;ert, and
is covered with &s;now and ice the greate&s;t part
of the year. But, as the&s;e lands are of va&s;t ex|tent,
and, as the coa&s;ts have been little frequent|ed
by modern navigators, they may have mi&s;|&s;ed
the place occupied by the de&s;cendents of
the&s;e poli&s;hed people; or the increa&s;e of the ice
<PB N="315" REF="350">
in this &s;ea may now, perhaps, prevent all acce&s;s
to them. If, however, maps can be tru&s;ted, the
whole coa&s;t of this country is known: It forms
a large penin&s;ula, at the extremity of which are
the two &s;traits of Frobi&s;her and of Frie&s;land,
where the cold is exce&s;&s;ive, although they are
not farther north than the Orkneys, that is, a|bout
60 degrees.</P>
<P>Between the we&s;t coa&s;t of Greenland, and
that of Labrador, the ocean forms a gulf, and
then a large mediterranean, which is the colde&s;t
of all &s;eas, and its coa&s;ts are little known. In
pur&s;uing this gulf, we meet with Davis's &s;trait,
which leads to the Chri&s;tian &s;ea, which termi|nates
in Baffin's bay, through which there ap|pears
to be an outlet into Hud&s;on's bay. The
&s;trait of Cumberland, which, like that of Davis,
may lead into the Chri&s;tian &s;ea, is more narrow
and more &s;ubject to be frozen. Hud&s;on's &s;trait,
though much farther &s;outh, is al&s;o frozen for
&s;ome part of the year: And it is remarkable,
that the tides are very high in the&s;e &s;eas and
&s;traits, although no tides take place in the inland
&s;eas of Europe, as the Baltic and Mediterranean.
This difference &s;eems to be occa&s;ioned by the
motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t, which pro|duces
high tides in &s;traits oppo&s;ite to the current
of the waters, or who&s;e mouths open to the ea&s;t.
Whereas, in tho&s;e of Europe, which open to the
we&s;t, there are no tides. The ocean, by its ge|neral
movement, ru&s;hes into the former, but
<PB N="316" REF="351">
from the latter; and this is the rea&s;on why
the tides are &s;o violent in the &s;eas of China,
Corea, and Kamt&s;chatka.</P>
<P>In &s;ailing down Hud&s;on's bay towards La|brador,
there is a narrow opening, which Davis,
in 1586, traver&s;ed for about 30 leagues, and
traded with the inhabitants. But no attempts
have hitherto been made to di&s;cover the whole
of this arm of the &s;ea. We know nothing of
the neighbouring country, but the land of the
E&s;quimaux. Fort Pon-chartrin is the only &s;et|tlement,
and the mo&s;t northerly part of this
country; and it is &s;eparated from the i&s;land of
Newfoundland by the &s;mall &s;trait of Bellei&s;le,
which is little frequented. As the ea&s;tern coa&s;t
of Newfoundland has the &s;ame direction with
that of Labrador, this i&s;land appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent, in the
&s;ame manner as I&s;le-Royal &s;eems to have been
detached from Acadia. The bottoms of the
great bank, and of the le&s;&s;er banks on which the
cod-fi&s;hery is carried on, are not deep; but, as
they &s;helve a great way under water, they pro|duce
violent currents. Between Cape Breton
and Newfoundland, there is a pretty large &s;trait,
which is the mouth of a &s;mall mediterranean,
called the <HI>Gulf of St Laurence.</HI> It &s;ends off a
branch, which extends a con&s;iderable way into
the country, and appears to be only the mouth
of the river of that name. In this arm of the
&s;ea the tides are very perceptible; and, even at
<PB N="317" REF="352">
Quebec, which is farther up the country, the
waters ri&s;e &s;everal feet. Leaving the gulf of St
Laurence, and following the coa&s;t of Acadia, we
meet with a &s;mall gulf called <HI>Bo&s;ton-Bay,</HI> which
is of a &s;quare figure, and advances but a little way
into the land. But, before we pur&s;ue this coa&s;t
any farther, it is worthy of remark, that, from
Newfoundland to Guiana, the ocean forms an
immen&s;e bay, that runs in upon the land as
far as Florida, which is more than 500 leagues.
This bay is &s;imilar to that of the Old Con|tinent
above de&s;cribed, where the ocean, af|ter
forming a large gulf between Kamt&s;chatka
and New Britain, gives ri&s;e to a great mediter|ranean,
which comprehends the &s;eas of Kamt|&s;chatka,
of Corea, of China, &amp;c. In the &s;ame
manner, in the New Continent, the ocean, after
forming a large gulf between Newfoundland
and Guiana, gives ri&s;e to a great mediterranean,
extending from the Antilles to Mexico; which
confirms what we have advanced concerning the
motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t: For it ap|pears
that the ocean has gained as much territory
on the ea&s;t of America as on the ea&s;t coa&s;t
of A&s;ia. Be&s;ides, the&s;e great gulfs in each con|tinent
lie under the &s;ame degrees of latitude,
and are nearly of equal extent. Such &s;ingular
relations, it would appear, mu&s;t have been pro|duced
by the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If we examine the po&s;ition of the Antilles,
beginning with the i&s;land of Trinidad, which is
<PB N="318" REF="353">
the &s;outhmo&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt but that
Trinidad, Tobago, the Granades, St Vincent,
Martinico, Marygalante, Antego, Barbadoes,
and all the adjacent i&s;les, once formed a chain
of mountains which extended from &s;outh to
north, like Newfoundland and the country of
the E&s;quimaux. Farther, the direction of the
Antilles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, if we begin with Bar|badoes,
and pa&s;s on to St Bartholomy, Porto-Rico,
St Domingo, and Cuba, is nearly the &s;ame
with the coa&s;ts of Cape Breton, Acadia, and
New England. All the&s;e i&s;lands lie &s;o clo&s;e to|gether,
that they may be regarded as a continued
belt of land, and as the mo&s;t elevated parts of a
country now occupied by the &s;ea. Mo&s;t of them,
in effect, are nothing but the tops of mountains;
and the &s;ea between them and the continent is a
true mediterranean, in which the tides are not
much more perceptible than in our Mediterra|nean,
although the &s;traits between the i&s;lands
are directly oppo&s;ite to the motion of the &s;ea
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, which &s;hould contribute to
rai&s;e the tides in the gulf of Mexico. But, as
this gulf is very broad, the waters elevated by
the tide, being expanded over a large &s;urface,
hardly produce any &s;en&s;ible change upon the
coa&s;t of Loui&s;ianna and &s;everal other places.</P>
<P>Both the Old and New Continents, therefore,
appear to have been encroached upon by the
ocean in the &s;ame latitudes: Both are furni&s;hed
with a great mediterranean, and a va&s;t number
<PB N="319" REF="354">
of i&s;lands, which likewi&s;e lie nearly in the &s;ame
latitudes. The only difference is, that the Old
Continent, being much larger than the New, has
a mediterranean on its we&s;t coa&s;t, to which the
New Continent has nothing analogous. But
both &s;eem to have undergone &s;imilar revolutions;
the&s;e revolutions are greate&s;t near their middle
parts, or between the tropics, where the motion
of the &s;ea is mo&s;t violent.</P>
<P>The coa&s;ts of Guiana, from the mouth of the
river Oronoko to that of the Amazones, offer
nothing remarkable. But the Amazones, which
is the large&s;t river in the univer&s;e, forms a con|&s;iderable
&s;heet of water near Coropa, before it
di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea by the two mouths
which &s;orround the i&s;land of Caviana. From
the mouth of the Amazones to Cape St Roche,
the river runs almo&s;t &s;traight ea&s;t; from Cape
St Roche to Cape St Augu&s;tine, it runs &s;outh;
and from Cape St Augu&s;tine, to the bay of All
Saints, it runs we&s;tward in &s;uch a manner that
this part of Bra&s;il projects con&s;iderably into the
ocean, which is directly oppo&s;ite to a &s;imilar
projection of the African coa&s;t. The bay of
All Saints is a &s;mall arm of the &s;ea, which ad|vances
about 50 leagues into the land, and is
much frequented by navigators. From this bay,
to Cape St Thomas, the coa&s;t runs &s;traight &s;outh,
and from thence, in a &s;outh-we&s;t direction, to
the mouth of the Plata, where an arm of the
&s;ea projects about 100 leagues into the land.
<PB N="320" REF="355">
From this river, to the &s;outhern extremity of
America, the ocean forms a large bay, which is
terminated by Falkland I&s;land, Cape A&s;&s;umption,
and other lands bordering on Terra del Fuego.
At the bottom of this bay is the &s;trait of Magel|lan,
the longe&s;t in the univer&s;e, and where the
tides ri&s;e very high. Beyond this is the &s;trait
of La Maire, which is much &s;horter; and, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI>
Cape Horn, which is the &s;outh point of Ame|rica.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of points or head-lands, it is
remarkable, that they all regard the &s;outh, and
that mo&s;t of them are cut by &s;traits that run
from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The point of South America
regards the Arctic Pole, and it is cut by the &s;trait
of Magellan: That of Greenland, which like|wi&s;e
has a &s;outhern a&s;pect, is cut from ea&s;t
to we&s;t by the &s;trait of Frobi&s;her: That of Afri|ca
regards al&s;o the &s;outh, and, beyond the Cape
of Good Hope, are banks and &s;hoals which ap|pear
to have been &s;eparated from it: That of
the penin&s;ula of India is cut by the &s;trait be|tween
it and i&s;land of Ceylon; and, like all
others, projects &s;outhward. The&s;e are facts;
but we are unable to give any explication of
them.</P>
<P>From Terra del Fuego, all along the we&s;t coa&s;t
of South America, the ocean makes con&s;iderable
advances into the land; and this coa&s;t &s;eems to
follow exactly the direction of the high moun|tains
which traver&s;e this part of the continent
<PB N="321" REF="356">
from &s;outh to north, from the Equator to the
Arctic Pole. Near the Line, the ocean forms a
large bay, extending from Cape St Francois to
Panama, that famous i&s;thmus, which, like that
of Suez, prevents the junction of the two &s;eas.
If the&s;e two necks of land were removed, both
the Old and the New Continent would be di|vided
into two di&s;tinct portions. From Panama
to California, there occurs nothing worthy of
remark. Between the penin&s;ula of California
and New Mexico, is a long arm of the ocean,
called the <HI>Vermilion Sea,</HI> which is more than 200
leagues long. In fine, the we&s;t coa&s;t of Cali|fornia
has been traced to the 43d degree of la|titude.
It was in this latitude that Drake, who
fir&s;t di&s;covered the land to the north of Califor|nia,
and which he called <HI>New Albion,</HI> was o|bliged,
by the rigour of the cold, to change his
cour&s;e, and to anchor in a &s;mall bay which
bears his name; &s;o that the countries beyond
the 43d or 44th degree, in this part of the globe,
are as little known as tho&s;e of North America
beyond the 48th degree, which is inhabited by
the Moozemleki, and the 51&s;t, which is inha|bited
by the A&s;&s;iniboils; the territory of the for|mer
&s;avages extends much farther we&s;t than that
of the latter. All beyond, for 1000 leagues in
length, and as much in breadth, is totally un|known,
unle&s;s the Ru&s;&s;ians, as they pretend,
have made &s;ome di&s;coveries by departing from
<PB N="322" REF="357">
Kamt&s;chatka, and vi&s;iting the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of
North America.</P>
<P>The ocean, then, &s;urrounds the whole globe,
without interruption, and we may &s;ail round it
by taking our departure from the &s;outh point
of America. But we are &s;till uncertain whether
the ocean &s;urrounds, in the &s;ame manner, the
north part of the globe; and all the navigators,
who have attempted to go from Europe to Chi|na
by the north-ea&s;t or north-we&s;t, have equally
failed in their enterpri&s;es.</P>
<P>Lakes differ from mediterraneans; the former
derive no water from the ocean; on the con|trary,
when they communicate with &s;eas, they
are con&s;tantly di&s;charging water into them.
Thus the Black Sea, which &s;ome geographers
have regarded as a branch of the Mediterranean,
and, of cour&s;e, as an appendage of the ocean, is
only a lake; becau&s;e, in place of receiving any
&s;upplies from the Mediterranean, its waters run
with rapidity through the Bo&s;phorus, in the
lake called the Sea of Marmora, and from thence
through the &s;traits of the Dardanelles into the
Grecian Sea. The Black Sea is about 250 leagues
long, and 100 broad: It receives a number
of large rivers, as the Danube, the Nieper, the
Don, the Boh, the Donjec, &amp;c. The Don,
which unites with the Donjec, before it arrives
at the Black Sea, forms a lake called the <HI>Palus
Meotis,</HI> which is more than 100 leagues in
length, and from 20 to 25 in breadth. The Sea
<PB N="323" REF="358">
of Marmora, which is below the Black Sea, is a
lake &s;maller than the Palus Meotis, being not
above 50 leagues long, and 8 or 9 broad.</P>
<P>It is related by &s;ome of the antients, and par|ticularly
by Diodorus Siculus, that the Euxine,
or Black Sea, was originally a great river or
lake, and had no communication with the Greek
Sea; but that its waters were, in the cour&s;e of
time, &s;o greatly augmented by the rivers that
fall into it, that they forced a pa&s;&s;age, fir&s;t by
the i&s;lands of Cyanea, and then by the Helle|&s;pont.
This opinion has great probability on
its &s;ide; and, I think, it is no difficult matter to
explain how the operation was effected: For,
&s;uppo&s;ing the bottom of the Black Sea to have
been formerly much lower than it is now, the
mud and &s;and carried down by the rivers would
gradually rai&s;e it, till the &s;urface of the water
was elevated above that of the land, and then
the water would nece&s;&s;arily find a pa&s;&s;age for
it&s;elf: And, as the rivers continue &s;till to tran&s;|port
&s;and and earth, and as, at the &s;ame time,
the quantity of water in the rivers dimini&s;hes in
proportion as the mountains from which they
&s;pring are lowered, it may happen, in the cour&s;e
of ages, that the Bo&s;phorus will again be filled
up. But, as effects of this nature depend on
many cau&s;es, we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with
&s;imple conjectures. Mr Tourne&s;ort, on the au|thority
of the antients, &s;ays, that the Black Sea,
which receives the waters of a great part of Eu|rope
<PB N="324" REF="359">
and A&s;ia, after being con&s;iderably augment|ed,
opened to it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age by the Bo&s;phorus,
and either formed the Mediterranean, or in|crea&s;ed
its waters to &s;uch a degree, that they
forced a pa&s;&s;age to the ocean through the &s;traits
of Gibraltar; and that the i&s;land of Atalantis,
mentioned by Planto, was, on this occa&s;ion, total|ly
overflowed. This notion cannot be &s;upport|ed;
for the ocean runs into the Mediterranean,
and not the Mediterranean into the ocean. Be|&s;ides,
M. Tournefort has not combined two e&s;|&s;ential
facts, though he has mentioned both of
them. The fir&s;t is, that the Black Sea receives
9 or 10 rivers, each of which furni&s;hes more
water than is di&s;charged by the Bo&s;phorus; and
the &s;econd, that the Mediterranean does not re|ceive
more water from rivers than the Black
Sea, though it be &s;even or eight times larger;
and what it receives from the Bo&s;phorus is not
the tenth part of what falls into the Black Sea.
How, therefore, could this tenth part of the
water that falls into a &s;mall &s;ea, produce not on|ly
a larger &s;ea, but augment its waters to &s;uch a

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Gibraltar, and overwhelm an i&s;land
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> extent than the whole of Europe?
It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to perceive that M. Tournefort has
not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered this matter. The
Mediterranean derives from the ocean at lea&s;t
ten times the quantity of water it receives from
the Black Sea; for the narrowe&s;t part of the
<PB N="325" REF="360">
Bo&s;phorus exceeds not 800 pace, while that of
the &s;traits of Gibraltar is more than 5000; and,
&s;uppo&s;ing the velocities of both to be equal, &s;till
the water in the &s;traits of Gibraltar is by much
the deepe&s;t.</P>
<P>M. Tournefort, who ridicules Polybius for
predicting that the Bo&s;phorus will in time be
filled up, has not attended &s;ufficiently to circum|&s;tances,
otherwi&s;e he would not have pronoun|ced
the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an event. Mu&s;t
not the Black Sea, which con&s;tantly receives the
&s;and and mud of eight or ten large rivers, gra|dually
fill up? Mu&s;t not the winds and the na|tural
current of the waters continually tran&s;port
part of the&s;e matters into the Bo&s;phous? It is,
therefore, extremely probable, that, in the cour&s;e
of ages, the Bo&s;phorus will be choaked up, when
the quantity of water di&s;charged by the rivers
into the Black Sea &s;hall be greatly dimini&s;hed.
Now, the rivers are dimini&s;hing daily, becau&s;e
the mountains, which collect the dews, and give
ri&s;e to the rivers, are continually dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Black Sea receives more water from ri|vers
than the Mediterranean; and Mr Tourne|fort
ob&s;erves, on this &s;ubject, 'That the greate&s;t
rivers in Europe fall into this &s;ea by means of
the Danube, into which are di&s;charged the ri|vers
of Subia, Franconia, Bavaria, Au&s;tria,
Hungary, Moravia, Corinthia, Croatia, Both|nia,
Servia, Tran&s;ylvania, and Wallachia: The
rivers of Black Ru&s;&s;ia and of Podolia fall like|wi&s;e
<PB N="326" REF="361">
wi&s;e into the &s;ame &s;ea by means of the Nie&s;ter;
tho&s;e of the &s;outhern and ea&s;tern parts of Po|land,
of the northern part of Mu&s;covy, and of
the country of the Co&s;&s;acks, fall into it, either
by the Nieper or Bori&s;thenes; the Tanais and
the Copa empty them&s;elves into the Black Sea
by the Cimmerian Bo&s;phorus; the rivers of
Mingrelia, the principal of which is the Pha&s;is,
al&s;o di&s;charge their contents into this &s;ea, and
likewi&s;e the Ca&s;almac, the Sangaris, and other
rivers of A&s;ia Minor which take a northern
cour&s;e: The&s;e va&s;t di&s;charges notwith&s;tanding,
the Thracian Bo&s;phorus, which is the only out|let
from the Black Sea, is not comparable to
any one of the&s;e great rivers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See voyage du Levant de Tournefort, vol. 2. p. 123.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>All the&s;e facts demon&s;trate the great quantity
of water carried off by evaporation; and it is
owing to this circum&s;tance that the ocean con|&s;tantly
runs into the Mediterranean by the &s;traits
of Gibraltar. It is difficult to a&s;certain the quan|tity
of water received by any &s;ea; it requires an
exact knowledge of the breadth, depth, and ve|locity
of all the rivers that fall into it, of their
augmentation and diminution in different &s;ea|&s;ons
of the year; and of the quantity which the
&s;ea lo&s;es by evaporation. This la&s;t is the mo&s;t
difficult to determine; for, &s;uppo&s;ing evapora|tion
to be proportioned to the &s;urfaces, it will
be greater in a warm than in a cold climate.
Be&s;ides, water mixed with &s;alt and bitumen eva|porates
<PB N="327" REF="362">
more &s;lowly than fre&s;h water; a &s;ea &s;ub|ject
to great agitations evaporates more quickly
than a calm &s;ea; and a difference in the depth
has al&s;o &s;ome effect. In fine, &s;o many particu|lars
are included in the theory of evaporation,
that it is not po&s;&s;ible to make an exact e&s;tima|tion
of it.</P>
<P>The water of the Black Sea is le&s;s clear, and
le&s;s &s;alt than that of the ocean. There are no
i&s;lands in it; and its tempe&s;ts are more violent
and more dangerous than tho&s;e of the ocean;
becau&s;e its waters, being extended in a ba&s;in
which has but an incon&s;iderable outlet, move,
when agitated, in a kind of whirlpools, which
beat upon all &s;ides of a ve&s;&s;el with an in&s;upport|able
violence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See voyages de Chardin, p. 142.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the Black Sea, the greate&s;t lake in the
world is the Ca&s;pian Sea, which extends from
&s;outh to north about 300 leagues, and its mean
breadth exceeds not 50. This lake receives the
Wolga, be&s;ides &s;everal other con&s;iderable rivers,
as the Kur, the Faie, and the Gempo. But,
what is &s;ingular, it receives not one river from
the ea&s;t coa&s;t; the country on that &s;ide is a &s;an|dy
de&s;ert, which remained, till lately, altogether
unknown. The Czar Peter I. &s;ent engineers to
make a chart of the Ca&s;pian Sea. It had been
repre&s;ented as round by former geographers;
but it is very long and very narrow. Its ea&s;t|ern
coa&s;t, and the neighbouring country, were
<PB N="328" REF="363">
entirely unknown; even Lake Aral, which is
about 100 leagues ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, was ei|ther
not known to exi&s;t, or was con&s;idered as a
part of this &s;ea. Thus, before the di&s;coveries
of the Czar, there was in this region an un|known
country of 300 leagues in length, and
100 or 150 in breadth. Lake Aral is nearly
oblong, and about 90 or 100 leagues long, and
50 or 60 broad. It receives the Sideroias and
the Oxus, two large rivers; but, like the Ca&s;|pian,
it has no outlet for di&s;charging its waters;
and, as the Ca&s;pian receives no rivers from the
ea&s;t, Lake Aral, on the contrary, receives none
from the we&s;t. Hence it is pre&s;umable, that
the&s;e two formerly con&s;tituted but one lake;
and the rivers being gradually choaked up, the
country between them would nece&s;&s;arily be co|vered
with &s;and. There are &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands in
the Ca&s;pian; and its waters are much fre&s;her than
tho&s;e of the ocean. Storms, in this &s;ea, are ex|ceedingly
dangerous; and it affords not navi|gation
to large ve&s;&s;els, on account of &s;hoals,
&s;and-banks, and rocks concealed under the &s;ur|face.
'The large&s;t ve&s;&s;els employed on the
Ca&s;pian,' &s;ays Pietro della Valle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 3. p. 235.</NOTE> 'along the
coa&s;ts of the province of Mazanda in Per&s;ia,
where &s;tands the town of Ferhabad, although
they be called <HI>&s;hips,</HI> are no better than our tar|tanes:
Their &s;ides are high; they draw little wa|ter,
and are flat-bottomed. They are built of this
<PB N="329" REF="364">
con&s;truction, not only becau&s;e this &s;ea is &s;hal|low
near the coa&s;ts, but becau&s;e it is full of
&s;hoals and &s;and-banks; &s;o that no other ve&s;&s;els
could be u&s;ed with &s;afety. I was &s;urpri&s;ed
to &s;ee no fi&s;hing carried on at Ferhabad, ex|cepting
&s;almons at the mouth of the river, a
bad kind of &s;turgeon, and other fre&s;h water
fi&s;hes of no value. I attributed this to their
ignorance of navigation and of the art of fi&s;h|ing,
till I was informed by the Cham of E&s;ter|abad,
that this &s;ea, at the di&s;tance of 20 or 30
miles from the &s;hore, is &s;o &s;hallow, that nets
could not be u&s;ed with advantage; and that
the &s;ame rea&s;on accounted for the con&s;truction
of their ve&s;&s;els, which carry no cannon, becau&s;e
the Ca&s;pian is not infe&s;ted with pirates.'</P>
<P>Struys, Avril, and others, affirm, that, in the
neighbourhood of Kilan, there are two gulfs,
which &s;wallow up the waters of the Ca&s;pian, and
carry them, by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, into the
Per&s;ic Gulf. De Fer, and other geographers,
have laid down the&s;e gulfs in their maps,
though we are a&s;&s;ured by the Czar's envoys,
that they have no exi&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1721.</NOTE>. The fact, with
regard to the willow leaves found on the Per&s;ic
Gulf, and which are alledged by the &s;ame au|thors
to be tran&s;ported from the Ca&s;pian Sea,
becau&s;e no willows grow near the Per&s;ic Gulf,
appears to be equally improbable as the &s;ubter|raneous
pa&s;&s;ages, which Gemelli Careri, as well
<PB N="330" REF="365">
as the Ru&s;&s;ians, maintain to be altogether ima|ginary.
Be&s;ides, the Ca&s;pian is about a third le&s;s
than the Black Sea, which la&s;t al&s;o receives more
water by rivers; evaporation, therefore, is a|lone
&s;ufficient to carry off all its adventitious wa|ters,
without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of imaginary gulfs,
or &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>There are lakes, or &s;eas, which neither re|ceive
nor di&s;charge rivers; there are others
which both receive and di&s;charge; and others
which only receive rivers. The Ca&s;pian, Lake
Aral, and the Dead Sea, are of the la&s;t kind:
In A&s;ia Minor, there is a &s;mall lake of the &s;ame
&s;pecies: There is another &s;till larger in Per&s;ia,
upon which the city of Marago is &s;ituated: It is
of an oval figure, and about 10 or 12 leagues
long, and 6 or 7 broad: It receives the Tauris,
which is not a very con&s;iderable river. If to
the&s;e we add a &s;mall lake of the &s;ame nature in
Greece, 12 or 15 leagues from Lepanto, we
have an enumeration of all the known lakes in
A&s;ia that belong to this &s;pecies. In Europe,
there is not a &s;ingle one of any con&s;ideration.
There are &s;everal &s;mall lakes of this kind in
Africa, as tho&s;e which receive the rivers Ghir,
Zez, Touguedout, and Tafilet. The&s;e four
lakes lie at no great di&s;tance from one another,
and are &s;ituated on the frontiers of Barbary,
near the de&s;art of Zaara. There is another in
the province of Kovar, which receives the river
that runs through the country of Berdoa. In
<PB N="331" REF="366">
North America, which abounds with lakes, there
are none of this kind, excepting two &s;mall col|lections
of water formed by brooks, the one
near Guatimapo, and the other &s;ome leagues
from Realnuevo, both in Mexico. But in Peru
there are two contiguous lakes, one of which,
Lake Titicaca, is very large, and receives a river
which ri&s;es near Cu&s;co; but no river i&s;&s;ues from
it. There is a &s;mall one in Tucuman, which
receives the river Salta; another, in the &s;ame
country, of greater extent, receives the Santiago;
and three or four between Tucuman and
Chili.</P>
<P>The&s;e lakes, which neither receive nor give
ri&s;e to any river, are more numerous than the
kind ju&s;t mentioned. They are a kind of
&s;wamps, which collect the rain water; or, they
may originate from &s;ubterraneous waters, which
i&s;&s;ue in the form of &s;prings in low grounds,
from which there is no fall to carry them off.
Tho&s;e rivers that overflow may al&s;o leave &s;tag|nating
waters upon the land, which remain a
con&s;iderable time, and are occa&s;ionally recruited
by &s;ub&s;equent inundations. Salt lakes may
&s;ometimes be produced by inundations from the
&s;ea, as that at Harlem, and &s;everal others, in
Holland, to which no other origin can be a&s;cri|bed.
The &s;ea, likewi&s;e, by abandoning certain
lands, may have left lakes in the low grounds
of particular countries, and which continue to
be maintained by the rains. Of this kind, there
<PB N="332" REF="367">
are &s;mall lakes in Europe, as in Ireland, in Jut|land,
in Italy, in the country of the Gri&s;ons,
in Poland, in Mu&s;covy, in Finland, and in
Greece: But all the&s;e are of little con&s;ideration.
In A&s;ia, near the Euphrates, in the de&s;art of Irac,
there is one above 15 leagues long; another in
Per&s;ia, nearly of the &s;ame extent, upon which
are &s;ituated the towns of Kelat, Tetuan, Va&s;tan,
and Van; a &s;mall one in Chorazan, near Fer|rior;
another in Independent Tartary, called
<HI>Lake Levi</HI>; two in Mu&s;covite Tartary; one in
Cochinchina; and, in &s;ine, a pretty large one
not far from Nankin. This la&s;t, however,
Communicates with the neighbouring &s;ea by a
canal of con&s;iderable extent. In Africa, there
is a &s;mall lake of this &s;pecies in the kingdom of
Morocco; another near Alexandria, which ap|pears
to have been left by the &s;ea; another, 8
or 10 leagues long, formed by the rain-water,
in the de&s;art of Azarad, about the 30th degree
of latitude; another, &s;till larger, upon which is
&s;ituated the town of Gaoga, under the 27th de|gree;
another, but much &s;maller, near the town
of Kanum, under the 30th degree; one near the
mouth of the river Gambia; &s;everal others in
Congo, about the 2d or 3d degree of &s;outh lati|tude;
two others in the country of the Caffres;
one of them, called <HI>Lake Ru&s;umbo,</HI> is not very
exten&s;ive; and the other, which lies in the pro|vince
of Arbuta, is perhaps the large&s;t of this
kind, being about 25 leagues long, and 7 or
<PB N="333" REF="368">
8 broad: There is likewi&s;e one of the&s;e lakes
near the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Madaga&s;car, about the
29th degree of &s;outh latitude.</P>
<P>In America, there is one of the&s;e lakes &s;itua|ted
in the middle of the penin&s;ula of Florida,
which has an i&s;land called <HI>Serrope</HI> in its centre.
The lake near the town of Mexico, which is
round, and about 10 leagues in diameter, belongs
likewi&s;e to this &s;pecies. There is another &s;till
more exten&s;ive in New Spain, about 25 leagues
from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the bay of Campeachy;
and another, of &s;maller dimen&s;ions, in the &s;ame
country, near the coa&s;t of the South Sea. Some
travellers have affirmed, that, in the interior
parts of Guiana, there is a very large lake of
this &s;pecies, which they call <HI>Golden Lake,</HI> or
<HI>Lake Parima</HI>; and they have given marvellous
accounts of the riches of the neighbouring coun|try,
and of the great quantities of gold du&s;t
found in this lake, which they alledge to be
more than 400 leagues in length, and above
125 in breadth; no river, it is &s;aid, either en|ters
into, or i&s;&s;ues from it. Though this lake
be laid down in &s;everal maps, its exi&s;tence is
&s;till problematical.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t common and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
lakes are tho&s;e which both receive and give ri&s;e
to rivers: As they are exceedingly numerous, I
&s;hall only mention the large&s;t, or the mo&s;t re|markable,
of them. Beginning with Europe,
we have, in Switzerland, the Lake of Geneva,
<PB N="334" REF="369">
that of Con&s;tance, &amp;c. In Hungary, Lake Ba|laton,
and another, of equal extent, in Livonia,
which &s;eparates this province from Ru&s;&s;ia; Lake
Lapwert in Finland, which is very long, and
divides into &s;everal branches, and Lake Oula,
which is of a circular figure: In Mu&s;covy, Lake
Ladoga, which is more than 25 leagues long,
and above 12 broad; Lake Onega, which is e|qually
long, but le&s;s in breadth; Lake Ilmen;
Lake Belozero, which is one of the &s;ources of the
Wolga; Lake Iwan-O&s;ero, which is one of the
&s;ources of the Don; and two other lakes, from
which the river Vitzogda derives its origin: In
Lapland, the lake from which i&s;&s;ues the river
Kimi; another much larger, and &s;ituated near
the coa&s;t of Wardhus; and &s;everal others of
le&s;s note, which give ri&s;e to the rivers Lula,
Pitha, and Uma: In Norway, two lakes nearly
of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with tho&s;e of Lapland:
In Sweden, Lake Vener, which is as large as
Lake Meller, upon which Stockholm is &s;ituated;
and two le&s;s con&s;iderable, one near Elvedal, and
the other near Lincopin.</P>
<P>In Siberia and in Mu&s;covite and Independent
Tartary, there are a great number of the&s;e lakes,
of which the principal are, the great lake Bara|ba,
which is more than 100 leagues long, and
of which the waters fall into the Irtis; the great
lake E&s;traguel the &s;ource of the Irtis; &s;everal
le&s;&s;er ones, the &s;ources of the Jeni&s;ca; the great
lake Kita, the &s;ource of the Oby; another great
<PB N="335" REF="370">
lake, the &s;ource of the Angara; Lake Baical,
which is more than 70 leagues long, and is
formed by the river Angara; and Lake Pehu,
the &s;ource of the Urack, &amp;c. In China and
Chine&s;e Tartary, we have Lake Dalai, the &s;ource
of the great river Argus, which falls into the
Amour; the lake of the Three Mountains, the
&s;ource of the river Helum, which falls likewi&s;e
into the Amour; the lakes of Cinhal, Cokmor,
and Sorama, the &s;ources of the river Hoamho;
two large lakes in the neighbourhood of Nankin,
&amp;c. In Tonquin is the Guadag, a lake of con|&s;iderable
magnitude. In India, we have Lake
Chiamat, which is the &s;ource of the river La|quia,
and lies near the &s;ources of the Ava, the
Longenu, &amp;c. This lake is more than 50 leagues
long, and about 40 broad. The &s;ource of the
Ganges is another lake; and one near Ca&s;h|mire
gives ri&s;e to the Indus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Africa there are Lake Cayar, and two or
three others, near the mouth of the Senegal;
Lake Guarda, and Lake Sigi&s;mus, which, toge|ther,
make a triangular lake of 100 leagues long,
and 75 broad, and contain a con&s;iderable i&s;land.
It is in this lake that the Niger lo&s;es its name,
and, at its exit, a&s;&s;umes that of <HI>Senegal.</HI> In a|&s;cending
towards the cour&s;e of this river, we
meet with another pretty large lake called <HI>Bour|nou,</HI>
where the Niger again changes its name;
for the river that falls into this lake is called
<HI>Gombaru.</HI> At the &s;ources of the Nile in Aethio|pia,
<PB N="336" REF="371">
is the great lake Gambia, which is above
50 leagues long. On the coa&s;t of Guiney are
al&s;o &s;everal lakes, which appear to have been o|riginally
formed by the &s;ea; and there are few
others in Africa of any con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>North America is the country of lakes. The
mo&s;t exten&s;ive of them are, Lake Superior, which
is about 125 leagues long, and 50 broad; Lake
Huron, which is near 100 leagues in length, and
about 40 in breadth; Lake Illionois, which,
comprehending the bay of Puants, is nearly as
exten&s;ive as Lake Huron; Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, which together, exceed 80 leagues in
length, by 20 or 25 in breadth; Lake Mi&s;ta&s;in,
to the north of Quebec, is about 50 leagues long;
Lake Champlain, to the &s;outh of Quebec, is
nearly of equal length; Lake Alemipigon, and
Lake Chri&s;tinaux, both to the north of Lake
Superior, are likewi&s;e con&s;iderable; the Lake of
the A&s;&s;miboils contains &s;everal i&s;lands, and is
more than 75 leagues long: Be&s;ides the Mexi|con
Gulf, there are two con&s;iderable lakes in
that country; that called Nicaragua, in the pro|vince
of the &s;ame name, is about 70 leagues in
length.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, in South America, there is a &s;mall
lake, the &s;ource of the Maragnon; a more ex|ten&s;ive
one gives ri&s;e to the river Paraguay:
There are, be&s;ides Lake Titicares, the waters of
which fall into the river Plata; two le&s;&s;er ones,
which di&s;charge their waters into the &s;ame ri|ver;
<PB N="337" REF="372">
and &s;ome incon&s;iderable ones in the inte|rior
parts of Chili.</P>
<P>All lakes that give ri&s;e to rivers, and all tho&s;e
which occur in the cour&s;e of rivers, or which
border upon and di&s;charge their waters into ri|vers,
are not &s;alt. Almo&s;t all tho&s;e, on the con|trary,
which receive rivers, but give ri&s;e to none,
are &s;alt. This circum&s;tance &s;eems to favour the
opinion, that the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea is occa&s;ioned
by the &s;alts brought down from the land by the
rivers; for we find &s;alt does not evaporate; and,
of cour&s;e, all that is tran&s;ported by the rivers
remains in the &s;ea: Although the water of ri|vers
appears to be fre&s;h, it is well known, that
it contains a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt, which, in the
cour&s;e of ages, might accumulate to &s;uch a de|gree
as would be &s;ufficient to produce the pre|&s;ent
&s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea, and which mu&s;t be con|tinually
augmenting. It is in this manner, I
pre&s;ume, the Ca&s;pian, Lake Aral, and the Black
Sea, have become &s;alt. With regard to tho&s;e
&s;eas, which, like mar&s;hes, or &s;wamps, neither
receive nor di&s;charge rivers, they are either &s;alt
or fre&s;h, according to their origin. Tho&s;e in
the neighbourhood of the &s;ea are commonly
&s;alt; and tho&s;e at a di&s;tance from it are fre&s;h;
becau&s;e the former have originated from an in|undations
of the &s;ea, and the latter from fre&s;h
fountains.</P>
<P>The waters of the Dead Sea contain a great deal
of the bitumen of Judea, which is nothing but
<PB N="338" REF="373">
a&s;phaltes; and, accordingly, this &s;ea is often
termed the <HI>A&s;phaltic Lake.</HI> The neighbouring
land is impregnated with this bitumen: And
many have imagined, like the Lake Avernus,
no fi&s;h could live in it, and that birds were &s;uf|focated
in attempting to fly over it. But &s;uch
di&s;mal effects are produced by neither of the&s;e
lakes; for both of them contain fi&s;hes, the birds
fly over them in &s;afety, and men bathe in them
with impunity.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that, in Bohemia, there is a lake,
which has holes in it &s;o deep, that they cannot
be &s;ounded, and that, from the&s;e holes, there
i&s;&s;ue violent winds which &s;weep over all Bohe|mia,
and, in winter, rai&s;e into the air ma&s;&s;es of
ice of more than 100 pounds weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Act. Leip&s;. anno 1682, p. 246.</NOTE>. We

that are external. The chief motion is that of
the tides, which ri&s;e and fall alternately, and
from which re&s;ults a general and perpetual mo|tion,
in all &s;eas, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The&s;e two
motions have an invariable relation to the mo|tions
<PB N="340" REF="375">
of the moon. During the full and new
moons, this motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t is mo&s;t re|markable,
as well as that of the tides, which ebb
and &s;low, upon mo&s;t coa&s;ts, every 6&frac12; hours: It
is always high tide when the moon arrives at
the meridian, either above or below the horizon
of the place; and it is always ebb or low tide
when the moon is at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from
the meridian, or when it ri&s;es and &s;ets. The
motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t is perpetual; becau&s;e,
when the tide is ri&s;ing, the whole ocean moves
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and pu&s;hes we&s;tward an im|men&s;e
body of water; and the ebbing, or reflux,
appears only to be owing to the &s;maller quan|tity
of water which is then impelled towards
the we&s;t. The flux, therefore, ought rather to
be regarded as a &s;welling, and the reflux as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the waters, which, in place of di|&s;turbing
the motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is the
cau&s;e which produces and renders it perpetual;
though this motion, for the rea&s;on already men|tioned,
is greater during the flux than the re|flux.</P>
<P>This motion is attended with the following
circum&s;tances: 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It is more &s;en&s;ible at the full
and new moon than at the quadratures; it is
likewi&s;e more violent in &s;pring and autumn than
in any other &s;ea&s;on; and it is weake&s;t at the fol|&s;tices.
This phaenomenon in occa&s;ioned by the
combined attractions of the moon and &s;un.
2<HI>d,</HI> The direction and quantity of this motion
<PB N="341" REF="376">
is often varied by the winds, e&s;pecially &s;uch as
blow con&s;tantly from the &s;ame quarter. Great
rivers, in like manner, by di&s;charging their wa|ter
into the &s;ea, produce currents which often
extend &s;everal leagues, and are &s;tronge&s;t when
the direction of the wind corre&s;ponds with the
general motion. Of this an example is afforded
in the Pacific Ocean, where the motion from
ea&s;t to we&s;t is con&s;tant, and very perceptible.
3<HI>d,</HI> It is worthy of remark, that, when one part
of a fluid is moved, the motion is communicated
to the whole: During the tides, therefore, a
great part of the ocean is &s;en&s;ibly put in mo|tion;
and, con&s;equently, the whole ocean, from
&s;urface to bottom, is moved at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>To render this more clear, let us attend to the
cau&s;es which produce the tides. We formerly
remarked, that the moon acted upon the earth
by a force which &s;ome call attraction, and others
gravity. This force penetrates the whole globe,
is exactly proportioned to the quantity of mat|ter,
and decrea&s;es as the &s;quares of the di&s;tances
increa&s;e. Let us next examine what effects
this force mu&s;t produce upon the waters when
the moon comes to the meridian of any place.
The &s;urface of the water immediately under the
moon is then nearer that planet than any other
part of the earth; of cour&s;e, that part of the &s;ea
mu&s;t be elevated towards the moon, and the
&s;ummit of this eminence mu&s;t be oppo&s;ite to the
moon's center. To produce this eminence, the
<PB N="342" REF="377">
waters upon the &s;urface, as well as tho&s;e at the
bottom, contribute their &s;hare, in proportion to
their di&s;tances from the moon, which acts upon
them in the inver&s;e ratio of the &s;quares of their
di&s;tances. Thus the &s;urface of this part of the
&s;ea is fir&s;t elevated; the &s;urface of the adjacent
parts is likewi&s;e elevated, but in a &s;maller de|gree;
and the waters at the bottom of all the&s;e
parts are rai&s;ed by the &s;ame cau&s;e. Hence, as
the whole portion of water under the moon is
rai&s;ed, the waters at a di&s;tance, upon which no
attraction is exerted, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ru&s;h for|ward
with precipitation to &s;upply the place of
tho&s;e which were elevated, or drawn towards
the moon. It is in this manner that the flux,
or high tide, is produced, which is more or le&s;s
&s;en&s;ible on different coa&s;ts, and which agitates
the &s;ea, not only at the &s;urface, but at the great|e&s;t
depths. The reflux, or ebb, is a con&s;equence
of the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the water, which,
when no longer acted upon by the moon, &s;ub|&s;ides,
and returns to occupy tho&s;e &s;hores from
which it had been forced to retire by a foreign
power. The &s;ame effect is produced when the
moon arrives at the antipode, or oppo&s;ite meri|dian,
but for a different rea&s;on: In the fir&s;t ca&s;e,
the waters ri&s;e, becau&s;e they are nearer the moon
than any other part of the globe; and, in the &s;e|cond,
they ri&s;e, becau&s;e the moon is at the greate&s;t
di&s;tance from them. It is ea&s;y to perceive that the
effect mu&s;t be the &s;ame; for, the waters here be|ing
<PB N="343" REF="378">
le&s;s attracted than tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite he|mi&s;phere,
they will nece&s;&s;arily recede, and form
an eminence, the highe&s;t point of which will be
where the attraction is lea&s;t, that is, in the me|ridian
oppo&s;ite to the moon's &s;tation, or to the
place where &s;he was thirteen hours before.
When the moon comes to the horizon, the tide
is ebb, and the &s;ea is in its natural &s;tate of equi|librium.
But, when &s;he is in the oppo&s;ite meri|dian,
this equilibrium cannot exi&s;t; for the wa|ters,
at the place oppo&s;ite to the moon, being
then at their great di&s;tance from her, they are
le&s;s attracted than the re&s;t of the globe; and
hence their relative gravity, by which they are
con&s;tantly kept in equilibrium, pu&s;hes them to|wards
the point oppo&s;ite to the moon, in order
to pre&s;erve this equilibrium. Thus, in both
ca&s;es, when the moon is in the meridian of a
place, or in the oppo&s;ite meridian, the waters
mu&s;t be elevated nearly to the &s;ame height; and,
con&s;equently, they mu&s;t ebb or flow back when
the moon is in the horizon, either at her ri&s;ing
or &s;etting. A motion, &s;uch as we have de|&s;cribed,
nece&s;&s;arily agitates the whole ma&s;s of
the ocean, from its &s;urface to its bottom; and,
as the bottom is le&s;s affected by winds than the
&s;urface, the motion produced in the former, by
the tides, is more regular and uniform.</P>
<P>From this alternate ebbing and flowing, there
re&s;ults, as already remarked, a con&s;tant motion
of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t; for the moon,
<PB N="344" REF="379">
which is the cau&s;e of the tides, moves from ea&s;t
to we&s;t, and, by acting &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in this di|rection,
&s;he draws the waters after her. This
motion is mo&s;t perceptible in &s;traits. At the
&s;traits of Magellan, for example, the tides ri&s;e
near 20 feet, and they continue at this height
&s;ix hours; but the reflux, or ebbing, la&s;ts only
two hours, and the waters run to the we&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Narborough's voyages.</NOTE>.
This inconte&s;tibly proves, that the reflux is not
equal to the flux, and that, from both, there re|&s;ults
a motion to the we&s;t, which is &s;tronger du|ring
the flux than the reflux. It is for this rea|&s;on,
that, in open &s;eas, at great di&s;tances from
land, the tides are only rendered perceptible by
this general current of the waters from ea&s;t to
we&s;t.</P>
<P>The tides are much higher between the tro|pics
than in any other part of the ocean. They
likewi&s;e ri&s;e higher in places that &s;tretch from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, in long and narrow bays, and upon
coa&s;ts which are interrupted with i&s;lands and
promontories. The highe&s;t known tides take
place at one of the mouths of the Indus, where
they ri&s;e 30 feet perpendicular. They have al|&s;o
a remarkable elevation at Malaya, in the
&s;traits of the Sund, in the Red Sea, in Nel&s;on's
bay, at the mouth of the river St Laurence, up|on
the coa&s;ts of China and Japan, at Panama, in
the gulf of Bengal, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="380">
The &s;ea's motion, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is mo&s;t
ob&s;ervable in particular places. Voyagers have
often remarked it in &s;ailing from India to Ma|daga&s;car
and Africa. It moves al&s;o with con&s;i|derable
force in the Pacific ocean, and between
the Moluccas and Brazil: But it is mo&s;t violent
in &s;traits: The waters are carried from ea&s;t to
we&s;t, through the &s;traits of Magellan, for ex|ample,
with &s;uch rapidity, that their motion is
perceptible, at a great di&s;tance, in the Atlantic
ocean. It was this circum&s;tance, it is &s;aid, that
made Magellan conjecture that a &s;trait exi&s;ted
by which there was a communication with the
two &s;eas. In the &s;traits formed by the Manillas,
in the channels between the Maldiva i&s;lands, and
in the gulf of Mexico, between Cuba and Juca|tan,
there is a con&s;tant current from ea&s;t to we&s;t.
This motion, in the gulf of Paria, is &s;o violent,
that its &s;trait is called the <HI>Dragon's Mouth.</HI> It
is likewi&s;e violent in the &s;ea of Canada, in that
of Tartary, and in Waigait's &s;traits, through
which it forces enormous ma&s;&s;es of ice into the
northern &s;eas. The Pacific ocean runs from ea&s;t
to we&s;t through the &s;traits of Japan; the &s;ea of
Japan runs towards China; and the Indian
ocean runs we&s;tward through the &s;traits of Java,
and other i&s;lands of India. It is, therefore, evi|dent,
that the &s;ea has a general and uniform
motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and, it is certain, that
the Atlantic runs towards America, and that the
<PB N="346" REF="381">
Pacific ocean flies from it, as is apparent at Cape
Current between Lima and Panama<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. p. 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In fine, the tides ri&s;e and fall alternately in
&s;ix hours and a half upon mo&s;t coa&s;ts, though
they happen at different hours, according to the
climate, and the po&s;ition of particular lands.
Thus the coa&s;ts of the &s;ea are perpetually beat
by the waves; and each tide carries off from the
higher grounds &s;mall quantities of matter, and
depo&s;ites them, at a di&s;tance, on the bottom of
the ocean. In the &s;ame manner, each tide car|ries
in, and depo&s;ites upon low coa&s;ts, &s;and,
&s;hells, and other &s;ea-bodies, which gradually
form horizontal &s;trata, and give ri&s;e to downs,
and little hills, &s;imilar to other hills, both in
their figure and internal &s;tructure. Thus the
&s;ea is con&s;tantly encroaching upon high coa&s;ts,
and lo&s;ing ground upon tho&s;e that are low.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the violent effects of a
&s;tormy &s;ea again&s;t a high coa&s;t, I &s;hall relate a
fact atte&s;ted by an eye-witne&s;s, a per&s;on worthy
of the highe&s;t credit. In the large&s;t of the Ork|ney
i&s;lands, there are coa&s;ts compo&s;ed of &s;olid
rock, above 200 feet high, and nearly perpendi|cular
to the &s;urface of the water. The tides, as
is u&s;ual in i&s;lands and promontories, ri&s;e very
high at this place. But, when a violent wind
concurs with the flow of the tide, the agitation
of the waters is &s;o great, that they often ri&s;e a|bove
the&s;e rocks, and fall down in the form of
<PB N="347" REF="382">
rain: Nay, to this amazing height, gravel, and
&s;tones as large as a man's fi&s;t, are rai&s;ed from
the foot of the rocks.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf &s;aw, in the port of Livourne, where
the &s;ea is much more tranquil, a tempe&s;t in De|cember
1731, which obliged the mariners to cut
off the ma&s;ts of their ve&s;&s;els, which were driven,
by the violence of the wind, from their anchors
in the road: The waters of the &s;ea &s;ur|mounted
fortifications of a great height; and,
as I was upon one of the mo&s;t advanced works,
before I could reach the town, I was more
drenched with &s;ea-water than I could have been
by the heavie&s;t rain.</P>
<P>The&s;e examples may convey a notion of the
violence with which the &s;ea acts again&s;t particu|lar
coa&s;ts. This con&s;tant agitation gradually
wears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told by Shaw, in his travels, that, in many parts on the coa&s;t of Syria and Phoenicia, the rocks had been cut, by the antients, into troughs of two or three yards long, and broad in proportion, for the purpo&s;e of making &s;alt by evapo|ration. But, notwith&s;tanding the hardne&s;s of the rocks, the&s;e troughs are now almo&s;t totally obliterated by the agitation of the waves.</NOTE>, corrodes, excavates, and dimini&s;hes the
quantity of the land. All the&s;e materials are tran&s;|ported
and depo&s;ited in places where the &s;ea is
more tranquil. In the time of &s;torms, the water is
foul and muddy, by the admixture of matters
detached from the coa&s;ts and from the bottom
of the &s;ea. The&s;e bodies, which are very vari|ous,
and carried from great di&s;tances, are thrown
<PB N="348" REF="383">
upon the low &s;hores, e&s;pecially after tempe&s;ts,
as ambergris on the we&s;t of Ireland, yellow am|ber
upon the coa&s;ts of Pomerania, cocoas upon
the coa&s;ts of India, &amp;c. and &s;ometimes pumice,
and other &s;ingular &s;tones. On this occa&s;ion, we
may quote a pa&s;&s;age from the New Voyages to
the i&s;lands of America. 'When at St Domingo,'
&s;ays the author, 'I was pre&s;ented, among other
things, with &s;ome light &s;tones, brought in by
the &s;ea in high &s;outh winds: Some of them
were two and a half feet long, 18 inches broad,
and about a foot thick; and yet they weighed
not above five pounds. They were as white
as &s;now, harder than pumice, of a fine grain,
and appeared not to be porous. When, how|ever,
they were thrown into water, they re|bounded
like a foot-ball thrown again&s;t the
ground. It was difficult to force them under
water with the hand. I inclo&s;ed two of the&s;e
&s;tones with thin boards, and found that they
bore 160 pounds without &s;inking. They &s;er|ved
my negro for a &s;hallop on which he divert|ed
him&s;elf in failing about the quay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 260.</NOTE>.' This
&s;tone mu&s;t have been a pumice of a clo&s;e fine
grain, which had been tran&s;ported by the &s;ea
from the neighbourhood of &s;ome volcano, in the
&s;ame manner as ambergris, cocoas, common pu|mice,
the &s;eeds of plants, reeds, &amp;c. are tran&s;|ported.
It is chiefly on the coa&s;ts of Ireland
and of Scotland that ob&s;ervations of this kind
have been made. The &s;ea, by its general mo|tion
<PB N="349" REF="384">
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, ought to carry to Ameri|ca
the productions of our coa&s;ts; and, it mu&s;t
be by the operation of &s;ome irregular move|ments,
that the productions of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t
Indias, and of the northern regions, are brought
upon our coa&s;ts. The winds are probably the
cau&s;e of tho&s;e effects. In open &s;eas, and at great
di&s;tances from land, large portions of the water
have been &s;een totally covered with pumice|&s;tones.
They could only come from volcano's
in i&s;lands, or on the continent; and they have
probably been tran&s;ported to the open &s;eas by
currents. Before the &s;outh part of America was
di&s;covered, and when it was not believed that
the Indian ocean had any communication with
ours, appearances of this kind fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to
the &s;u&s;picion that &s;uch a communication was not
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The alternate motion of the tides, and the
uniform motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t,
exhibit different appearances in different climates,
according to the different indentations in the
land, and the height of the coa&s;ts. In &s;ome
places the motion from ea&s;t to we&s;t is not per|ceptible;
at others, it moves in a contrary direc|tion,
as on the coa&s;t of Guiney. But the&s;e con|trary
motions are occa&s;ioned by the winds, by
the po&s;ition of the land, by the waters of great
rivers, and by the di&s;po&s;ition of the bottom of
the &s;ea. All the&s;e cau&s;es produce currents,
which often change the direction of the general
<PB N="350" REF="385">
movement. But, as this motion from ea&s;t to
we&s;t is the greate&s;t, mo&s;t general, and con&s;tant,
it ought to produce the mo&s;t &s;ignal effects; and,
upon the whole, the &s;ea mu&s;t gradually gain
ground on the we&s;t, and lo&s;e it on the ea&s;t; and,
although, upon coa&s;ts where the we&s;t wind blows
during the greate&s;t part of the year, as in France
and Britain, the &s;ea may gain land on the ea&s;t;
yet the&s;e exceptions de&s;troy not the effect of the
general cau&s;e.</P>

<P>THE coa&s;ts of the &s;ea may be divided
into three kinds: 1. High coa&s;ts com|po&s;ed
of hard rocks, commonly perpendicular,
and of a con&s;iderable elevation, ri&s;ing &s;ome|times
to the height of 700 or 800 feet. 2.
Low coa&s;ts, of which &s;ome are almo&s;t level with
the &s;urface of the water, and others have a &s;mall
elevation, and are often bordered with rocks
nearly of a level with the water, which give
ri&s;e to breakers, and render the approach of &s;hips
exceedingly dangerous. 3. Downs, or coa&s;ts
formed by &s;and, either accumulated by the &s;ea,
or brought down and depo&s;ited by rivers: The&s;e
<PB N="352" REF="387">
downs form hills of more or le&s;s elevation, ac|cording
to circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The coa&s;ts of Italy are lined with marble and
rocks of different &s;pecies. Tho&s;e rocks ap|pear
at a di&s;tance like perpendicular pillars of
marble. The coa&s;ts of France, from Bre&s;t to
Bourdeaux, con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of rocks on
a level with the &s;ea, which occa&s;ion breakers.
The coa&s;ts of England, of Spain, and of many
other places, are bordered with rocks and hard
&s;tones, excepting particular &s;pots which are em|ployed
as roads and harbours.</P>
<P>The depth of the water along the coa&s;ts is
generally proportioned to their elevation; a high
coa&s;t indicates a deep water; and, on low coa&s;ts,
the water is commonly &s;hallow. The inequa|lities
at the bottom of the &s;ea near the coa&s;ts
likewi&s;e corre&s;pond with the inequalities in the
&s;urface of the ground along the &s;hore. This
&s;ubject is illu&s;trated in the following manner by
a celebrated voyager.</P>
<P>'I have made it my general ob&s;ervation, that,
where the land is fenced with &s;teep rocks and
cliffs again&s;t the &s;ea, there the &s;ea is very deep,
and &s;eldom affords anchor-ground; and, on
the other &s;ide, where the land falls away with
a declivity into the &s;ea, (although the land be
extraordinary high within,) yet there are com|monly
good &s;oundings, and con&s;equently an|choring;
and, as the vi&s;ible declivity of the
land appears near, or at the edge of the water,
<PB N="353" REF="388">
whether pretty &s;teep, or more &s;loping, &s;o we
commonly find our anchor-ground to be more
or le&s;s deep or &s;teep; therefore we come near|er
the &s;hore, or anchor farther off, as we &s;ee
convenient; for there is no coa&s;t in the world,
that I know, or have heard of, where the land
is of a continual height, without &s;ome &s;mall
vallies or declivities, which lie intermixed with
the high land. They are the &s;ub&s;iding of val|lies
or low lands, that make dents in the &s;hore
and creeks, &s;mall bays, and harbours, or little
coves, &amp;c. which afford good anchoring, the
&s;urface of the earth being there lodged deep
under water. Thus we find many good har|bours
on &s;uch coa&s;ts, where the land bounds
the &s;ea with &s;teep cliffs, by rea&s;on of the de|clivities,
or &s;ub&s;iding of the land between the&s;e
cliffs: But, where the declen&s;ion from the hills
or cliffs is not within land, between hill and
hill, but, as on the coa&s;t of Chili and Peru, the
declivity is toward the main &s;ea, or into it, the
coa&s;t being perpendicular, or very &s;teep from
the neighbouring hills, as in tho&s;e countries
from the Andes, that run along the &s;hore,
there is a deep &s;ea, and few or no harbours or
creeks. All that coa&s;t is too &s;teep for anchor|ing,
and hath the fewe&s;t roads fit for &s;hips
of any coa&s;t I know. The coa&s;ts of Gallicia,
Portugal, Norway, and Newfoundland, &amp;c.
are coa&s;ts like the Peruvian, and the high
i&s;lands of the Archipelago; but yet not &s;o
<PB N="354" REF="389">
&s;canty of good harbours; for, where there are
&s;hort ridges of land, there are good bays at
the extremities of tho&s;e ridges, where they
plunge into the &s;ea; as on the coa&s;t of Ca|raccos,
&amp;c. The i&s;land of John Ferdinando,
and the i&s;land of St Helena, &amp;c. are &s;uch high
land with deep &s;hore: And, in general, the
plunging of any land under water, &s;eems to
be in proportion to the ri&s;ing of its continuous
part above water, more or le&s;s &s;teep; and it
mu&s;t be a bottom almo&s;t level, or very gently
declining, that affords good anchoring, &s;hips
being &s;oon driven from their moorings on a
&s;teep bank; therefore, we never &s;trive to anchor
where we &s;ee the land high, and bounding the
&s;ea with &s;teep cliffs; and, for this rea&s;on, when
we came in &s;ight of States-I&s;land, near Terra
del Fuego, before we entered into the South-Seas,
we did not &s;o much as think of anchor|ing
after we &s;aw what land it was, becau&s;e of
the &s;teep cliffs which appeared again&s;t the &s;ea;
yet there might be little harbours or coves for
&s;hallops, or the like, to anchor in, which we
did not &s;ee, or &s;earch after.'</P>
<P>'As high &s;teep cliffs bounding on the &s;ea
have this ill con&s;equence, that they &s;eldom af|ford
anchoring; &s;o they have this benefit, that
we can &s;ee them far off, and fail clo&s;e to them,
without danger; for which rea&s;on we call
them bold &s;hores; whereas low land, on the
contrary, is &s;een but a little way, and in many
<PB N="355" REF="390">
places we dare not come near it, for fear of
running a-ground before we &s;ee it. Be&s;ides,
there are, in many places, &s;hoals thrown out
by the cour&s;e of great rivers, that from the
low land fall into the &s;ea.'</P>
<P>'This which I have &s;aid, that there is u&s;ually
good anchoring near low lands, may be illu|&s;trated
by &s;everal in&s;tances. Thus, on the
&s;outh &s;ide of the bay of Campeachy, there is
mo&s;tly low land, and there al&s;o is good an|choring
all along &s;hore; and, in &s;ome places
to the ea&s;tward of the town of Campeachy,
we &s;hall have &s;o many fathom as we are leagues
off from land; that is, from 9 or 10 leagues
di&s;tance, till you come within 4 leagues; and
from thence to land it grows but &s;hallower.
The bay of Honduras al&s;o is low land, and con|tinues
mo&s;tly &s;o, as we pa&s;&s;ed along from thence
to the coa&s;ts of Portobel, and Cartagena, till
we came as high as Santa Martha; afterwards
the land is low again, till you come towards
the coa&s;t of Caraccos, which is a high coa&s;t
and bold &s;hore. The land about Surinam, on
the &s;ame coa&s;t, is low and good anchoring, and
that over on the coa&s;t of Guinea is &s;uch al&s;o.
And &s;uch, too, is the bay of Panama, where
the pilot-book orders the pilot always to &s;ound,
and not to come within &s;uch a depth, be it by
night or day. In the &s;ame &s;eas, from the high
land of Guatimala in Mexico, to California,
there is mo&s;tly low land and good anchoring.

<P>It is, therefore, fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the ob&s;er|vations
of navigators, that there are, in the bot|tom
of the &s;ea, con&s;iderable mountains, and o|ther
inequalities. We are al&s;o a&s;&s;ured by the
te&s;timony of divers, that there are &s;maller ine|qualities
occa&s;ioned by rocks, and that the cold
is greate&s;t in the hollows or valleys. In general,
as formerly remarked, the depths of open &s;eas
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in proportion to their di&s;tance from
the coa&s;ts. It appears, from M. Buache's
chart of that part of the ocean which lies be|tween
<PB N="357" REF="392">
the coa&s;ts of Africa and America, and
from the draughts he has given us of the &s;ea
from Cape Tagrin to Rio-grand, that the bot|tom
of the ocean is as irregular as the &s;urface
of the land; that Abrolhos, where there are
<HI>vigies,</HI> and where &s;ome of the rocks are on a
level with the water, are only the tops of large
and high mountains, of which Dolphin i&s;land
is one of the mo&s;t elevated points; that the Cape
de Verd i&s;lands are likewi&s;e the tops of moun|tains;
and that all round the&s;e abrolhos and
i&s;lands, the depth of the &s;ea is unfathomable.</P>
<P>With regard to the qualities of the different
&s;oils at the bottom of the &s;ea, little can be &s;aid
with preci&s;ion, as all our knowledge is derived
from &s;ounding and from divers. We on|ly
know, that &s;ome places are covered with
&s;lime and mud of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, in
which anchors can have no hold: It is proba|ble
that, in the&s;e places, the mud is depo&s;ited by
rivers. Other parts are covered with &s;and of
different kinds, &s;imilar to tho&s;e upon land. In
others are heaps of &s;hells, madrepores, corals,
and other productions of in&s;ects, ju&s;t beginning
to unite and to a&s;&s;ume the form of &s;tones: In
others, we find fragments of &s;tones, gravel, and
frequently &s;tones and marbles compleatly from|ed.
In the Maldiva i&s;lands, for example, they
build their hou&s;es with a hard &s;tone rai&s;ed from
&s;ome fathoms under water. At Mar&s;eilles very
good marble is rai&s;ed from the bottom of the
<PB N="358" REF="393">
&s;ea, which is &s;o far from wa&s;ting or de&s;troying
&s;tones and marble, that, as &s;hall be proved in
our di&s;cour&s;e on minerals, it creates and pre&s;erves
them: It is the &s;un, the earth, the air, and the
rains, which alone corrupt and de&s;troy the&s;e
&s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The bottom of the &s;ea mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of
the &s;ame materials as the &s;urface of the earth
which we inhabit, &s;ince the very &s;ame &s;ub&s;tan|ces
are found on both. At the bottom of &s;ome
parts of the ocean are va&s;t collections of &s;hells,
madrepores, and corals; and we find, upon
land, numberle&s;s quarries, banks of chalk, and
of other &s;ub&s;tances, mixed with the &s;ame &s;hells,
madrepores, and corals; &s;o that, in every view,
the dry parts of this globe re&s;emble tho&s;e cover|ed
with the waters, both in compo&s;ition of ma|terials,
and in &s;uperficial inequalities.</P>
<P>To the&s;e inequalities at the bottom, we mu&s;t
a&s;cribe the origin of currents; for, if the bot|tom
were uniform and level, there could be no
current but the general motion from ea&s;t to
we&s;t, and &s;uch as might occa&s;ionally be produ|ced
by the winds. But what inconte&s;tibly
proves, that mo&s;t currents are produced by the
tides, and take their direction from inequalities
at the bottom, is, that they uniformly follow
the tides, and change their cour&s;e at every ebb
and flow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pietro della Valle on the currents in the Gulf of Cam|baia, vol. 6. p. 363.</NOTE>. This is confirmed by the te&s;timony
<PB N="359" REF="394">
of all navigators, who unanimou&s;ly affirm, that,
in tho&s;e places where the tides are mo&s;t impetu|ous,
the currents are likewi&s;e mo&s;t rapid.</P>
<P>Thus it is apparent, that the tides give ri&s;e to
currents, and that they always follow the di|rection
of the oppo&s;ite hills or mountains be|tween
which they run. Currents produced by
winds likewi&s;e ob&s;erve the direction of the emi|nences
concealed under the waters; for they
&s;eldom run in the direct path of the winds; nei|ther
do tho&s;e produced by the tides invariably
ob&s;erve the cour&s;e pointed out by their original
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To give a di&s;tinct idea of the origin of cur|rents,
let it be remarked, that they take place in
all &s;eas; that &s;ome are rapid, and others
&s;low; that &s;ome are of great extent both in
length and breadth, and others &s;horter and nar|rower;
that the &s;ame cau&s;e by which they are
produced, whether it be the wind or the tides,
frequently be&s;tows on each a difference both in
celerity and direction; that a north wind, for
example, which ought to produce a general mo|tion
towards the &s;outh, gives ri&s;e, on the con|trary,
to a number of &s;eparate currents, very
different both in their direction and extent, &s;ome
running &s;outh, others &s;outh-ea&s;t, and others
&s;outh-we&s;t; &s;ome are rapid, others &s;low; &s;ome
long and broad, and others &s;hort and narrow:
In a word, their motions are &s;o various and
combined, that they lo&s;e all re&s;emblance to their
<PB N="360" REF="395">
general cau&s;e. When a contrary wind blows,
every motion is uniformly rever&s;ed; and the
cour&s;e of the different currents is preci&s;ely the
&s;ame as would nece&s;&s;arily take place between
two oppo&s;ite and neighbouring hills upon the
&s;urface of the land, were it covered with water.
Of this, the Maldiva and Indian i&s;lands, where
the winds blow and the currents run regularly
for &s;ix months in oppo&s;ite directions, afford mo&s;t
&s;triking examples. The &s;ame thing has been
remarked of currents between &s;hoals and &s;and|banks.
In general, all currents, from whatever
cau&s;e they proceed, have the &s;ame dimen&s;ions
and the &s;ame direction through their whole
cour&s;e; but they differ greatly from each other
in every re&s;pect. This uniformity and variety
can proceed from no other cau&s;e but the ine|qualities
of the hills, mountains, and vallies, at
the bottom of the ocean; for, it is an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
fact, that the current between two i&s;lands
follows the direction of the coa&s;ts; and the
&s;ame phaenomenon is exhibited between &s;hoals
and &s;and-banks. The hills and mountains in
the &s;ea, therefore, may be con&s;idered as the
banks which contain and direct the currents:
Hence a current is a river, the breadth of which
is determined by that of the valley through
which it runs; its rapidity is proportioned to
the force by which it is produced, combined
with the breadth of the interval through which
it pa&s;&s;es; and its direction is marked out by the
<PB N="361" REF="396">
po&s;ition of the hills and other inequalities be|tween
which it &s;hapes its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>An opportunity is now afforded us of ex|plaining
that &s;ingular corre&s;pondence between
the angles of hills and mountains, which is ob|&s;ervable
in every country of the world. We
have already remarked this uniform corre&s;pon|dence
of angles in the banks of rivers. The
cau&s;e of this effect depends on the laws of hy|dro&s;tatics,
and might be ea&s;ily explained. But
it is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that the
fact is general, and univer&s;ally known; and
every man may &s;atisfy him&s;elf with his own
eyes, that, when the bank of a river projects in|to
the land, to the left, for in&s;tance, the oppo|&s;ite
bank, on the contrary, makes a projection
from the land on the right.</P>
<P>The currents of the ocean, therefore, which
ought to be regarded as large rivers, and as &s;ub|ject
to the &s;ame laws as tho&s;e on land, mu&s;t,
like them, have formed, through the whole ex|tent
of their cour&s;e, many &s;inuo&s;ities or wind|ings
with corre&s;ponding angles or projections:
And, as the banks of currents are hills and
mountains, either above or below the &s;urface of
the water, they mu&s;t have produced on the&s;e
eminences the &s;ame effects as our rivers do up|on
their banks. Thus, we have no longer any
rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed, that our hills and
mountains, which were formerly covered with
<PB N="362" REF="397">
the &s;ea, and formed by the &s;ediments of its wa|ters,
&s;hould have a&s;&s;umed, by the motion of its
currents, this regular figure, ari&s;ing from the
corre&s;pondence of their oppo&s;ite angles. They
were originally banks of currents, or of &s;ea-ri|vers,
and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have a&s;&s;umed a figure
and direction &s;imilar to tho&s;e of land-rivers.</P>
<P>This alone, independent of the other proofs
which we have adduced, is a &s;ufficient demon|&s;tration
that all our pre&s;ent continents and
i&s;lands were formerly covered with the waters
of the ocean, and throws much light on the
theory which I have been endeavouring to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.
It was not enough to have proved that
the internal &s;trata of the earth were formed by
&s;ediments of the waters; that the mountains
were elevated by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive accumulations of the&s;e
&s;ediments; or, that many &s;trata were impreg|nated
with &s;hells and other productions of the
&s;ea. It was &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate and
a&s;&s;ign the real cau&s;e of the corre&s;pondence in
the angles of mountains, which hitherto had
never been attempted, but which, when united
with the other proofs, forms a connected chain
of evidence in &s;upport of my theory, as com|pleat
as the nature of phy&s;ical rea&s;oning will
admit.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;picuous currents of the ocean
are tho&s;e in the Atlantic near the coa&s;t of Gui|ney.
They extend from Cape Verd to the bay
of Fernandopo. They run from we&s;t to ea&s;t,
<PB N="363" REF="398">
which is contrary to the general motion of the
&s;ea; and they are &s;o rapid, that ve&s;&s;els &s;ail in
two days from Moura to Rio de Benin, about
150 leagues, but require &s;ix or &s;even weeks to
return. It would even be impo&s;&s;ible to clear
the&s;e latitudes, were it not by means of the tem|pe&s;tuous
winds which &s;uddenly ari&s;e in them:
But there are &s;ometimes whole &s;ea&s;ons in which
the mariner is obliged to remain &s;tationary, on
account of perpetual calms, the &s;ea having here
no motion but what it derives from the currents;
and the&s;e always run in upon the coa&s;ts, from
which they extend not above 20 leagues. Near
the i&s;land of Sumatra, there are rapid currents,
which run from &s;outh to north, and which have
probably given ri&s;e to the bay between Malacca
and India. We find &s;imilar currents between
Java and the lands of Magellan, and between
the Cape of Good Hope and Madaga&s;car, e&s;pe|cially
on the African coa&s;t from Natal to the
Cape. In the Pacific ocean, upon the coa&s;ts of
Peru, and the re&s;t of America, the waters move
from &s;outh to north, which is probably owing
to the con&s;tant blowing of the &s;outh wind. The
&s;ame motion from &s;outh to north has been re|marked
on the coa&s;ts of Bra&s;il, from Cape St
Augu&s;tine to the Antilles, and from the mouth
of the Manilla &s;traits to the Philippines and
Japan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="399">
There are violent currents in the neighbour|hood
of the Maldiva i&s;lands; and between the&s;e
i&s;lands, as already ob&s;erved, the currents run al|ternately
in oppo&s;ite directions &s;ix months in the
year, and are probably occa&s;ioned by the trade|winds.</P>
<P>We only here enumerate &s;uch currents as are
remarkable both for their extent and their rapi|dity;
becau&s;e the number of le&s;&s;er currents is
almo&s;t infinite. The tides, the winds, and every
cau&s;e that agitates the waters, produce currents,
which are more or le&s;s perceptible in different
places. We have already remarked, that the
bottom of the &s;ea is, like the land, inter&s;ected
with mountains and vallies, &s;hoals and &s;and|banks.
In all the mountainous places, the cur|rents
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be violent; and, where
the bottom is &s;mooth and level, they are almo&s;t
imperceptible; for the rapidity of a current mu&s;t
augment in proportion to the ob&s;tacles the water
meets with. The current between two chains
of mountains will be more or le&s;s violent in
proportion to their di&s;tance. The &s;ame thing
mu&s;t happen between two banks of &s;and, or two
adjacent i&s;lands. It is, accordingly, remarkable,
that, in the Indian ocean, which is inter&s;ected
with an innumerable quantity of i&s;lands and
&s;and-banks, there are every where currents,
which, by their rapidity, render navigation ex|tremely
dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="400">
Currents are not only occa&s;ioned by inequa|lities
at the bottom; but a &s;imilar effect is pro|duced
by the coa&s;ts, from which the waters are
repelled to greater or le&s;s di&s;tances. This re|gorging
of the waters may be rendered perpe|tual
and violent by particular circum&s;tances: An
oblique po&s;ition, for example, of a coa&s;t, its con|tiguity
to a bay or a great river, a promontory,
or any particular ob&s;tacle to the general move|ment
of the waters, will always give ri&s;e to a
current: Now, as nothing is more irregular than
the bottom and the coa&s;ts of the &s;ea, the num|ber
of currents that every where appear ought
not to create &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>All currents have a determinate breadth, pro|portioned
to the interval between the two emi|nences
which limit them. They run in the &s;ame
manner as land-rivers; they form a channel,
and cut their banks in a regular manner, with
corre&s;ponding angles: In fine, the currents of
the ocean have &s;cooped out our valleys, &s;haped
our mountains, and be&s;towed upon the land,
while it remained under the &s;urface of the wa|ters,
the form under which it now appears.</P>
<P>If any doubt &s;hould remain concerning the
corre&s;pondence in the angles of mountains, I
appeal to the te&s;timony of every man's ob&s;erva|tion.
Every traveller may remark this corre|&s;pondence
in oppo&s;ite hills. When a hill makes
a projection to the right, the oppo&s;ite one uni|formly
recedes to the left. Be&s;ides, in oppo&s;ite
<PB N="366" REF="401">
hills &s;eparated by vallies, there is rarely any dif|ference
in their height. The more I ob&s;erve
the contours and elevations of hills, I am the
more convinced of the corre&s;pondence of their
angles, and of their re&s;emblance to the channels
and banks of rivers. It was the repeated ob&s;er|vation
of this &s;urpri&s;ing regularity and re&s;em|blance
that fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the theory
of the earth which I am now &s;upporting. When
to this are added the paralleli&s;m of the &s;trata,
and the &s;hells &s;o univer&s;ally incorporated with
different materials, no &s;ubject of this nature can
admit of a greater degree of probability.</P>

<P>IN our climates, nothing can appear to be

and direction of the winds. But there are &s;ome
countries where this irregularity is not &s;o great,

the &s;ame direction, and with nearly the &s;ame de|gree

and powerful than others; but it is diffi|cult
to e&s;timate their preci&s;e effects, becau&s;e the&s;e
are often modified by &s;econdary cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="403">
The heat of the &s;un is the mo&s;t powerful
cau&s;e of winds: It produces a con&s;iderable and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive rarefaction in the different parts of
the atmo&s;phere, and gives ri&s;e to an ea&s;t-wind,
which blows con&s;tantly between the Tropics,
where the rarefaction is greate&s;t.</P>
<P>The force of the &s;un's attraction upon the at|mo&s;phere,
and even that of the moon, are in|con&s;iderable,
when compared with the cau&s;e
ju&s;t mentioned. This force it is true, produces
a motion in the air &s;imilar to that of the tides
in the &s;ea: But, though the air is ela&s;tic, and
800 times lighter than water, the motion pro|duced
by attraction cannot exceed what is ex|cited
in the waters of the ocean by the &s;ame
cau&s;e; for the action of gravity being propor|tioned
to the quantity of matter, it mu&s;t elevate
a &s;ea of water, of air, or of quick&s;ilver, nearly
to the &s;ame height. Hence the influence of the
planets upon the air mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Reflections fur la Cau&s;e Generale des Vents, par M. D'Alembert.</NOTE>;
and, though it mu&s;t occa&s;ion a &s;light motion
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, this motion becomes alto|gether
in&s;en&s;ible when compared with that pro|duced
by the heat of the &s;un: But, as the rare|faction
is always greate&s;t when the &s;un is in the
zenith, the current of air mu&s;t follow the cour&s;e
of the &s;un, and produce a con&s;tant wind from
ea&s;t to we&s;t. This wind blows perpetually at
&s;ea in the Torrid Zone, and at land, in mo&s;t
<PB N="369" REF="404">
places between the Tropics. It is this wind
which we perceive when the &s;un ri&s;es; and, in
general, ea&s;t winds are more frequent, and more
violent than we&s;t winds. The general wind,
from ea&s;t to we&s;t, extends even beyond the
Tropics. It blows &s;o con&s;tantly in the Pacific
ocean, that the &s;hips coming from Acapulco to
the Philippines, perform their voyage, which is
more than 2700 leagues, without the lea&s;t dan|ger,
and without, almo&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of being
directed. In the Atlantic, between Africa and
Bra&s;il, this wind is equally con&s;tant. It is like|wi&s;e
felt between the Philippines and Africa;
but there it is le&s;s con&s;tant, on account of the
ob&s;tacles it meets with from the numerous
i&s;lands in that &s;ea; for it blows, during the
months of January, February, March, and April,
between the Mozambique coa&s;t and India; but
it gives place to other winds during the re&s;t of
the year: And, though it is le&s;s perceptible on
the coa&s;ts than on the open &s;ea, and &s;till le&s;s in
the interior parts of continents than on the
coa&s;ts, yet, in &s;ome places, it blows almo&s;t per|petually,
as on the ea&s;t coa&s;ts of Bra&s;il, on the
coa&s;ts of Loango in Africa, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This wind is con&s;tant under the Line; and,
therefore, in going from Europe to America,
mariners direct their cour&s;e &s;outhward, along
the coa&s;ts of Spain and Africa, till they come
within 20 degrees of the Equator, where they
fall in with the ea&s;t, or trade-wind, which car|ries
<PB N="370" REF="405">
them directly to the coa&s;t of America. By
means of the &s;ame wind, the voyage from Aca|pulco
to the Philippines is performed in two
months; but the return from the Philippines
to Acapulco is much more difficult, and requires
a longer time. About 28 or 30 degrees on
this &s;ide of the Line, the we&s;t wind is equally
con&s;tant; and, for this rea&s;on, the ve&s;&s;els return|ing
from the We&s;t Indies to Europe, ob&s;erve
not the &s;ame rout as in going out. Tho&s;e from
New Spain run north along the coa&s;t till they
arrive at the Havannah, in the i&s;land of Cuba;
and from thence they proceed northward till
they fall in with the we&s;t wind, which carries
them to the Azores, and then to Spain. In the
&s;ame manner, ve&s;&s;els returning by the South
Sea from the Philippines or China, to Peru or
Mexico, &s;ail north as far as Japan; and, under
that latitude, they &s;ail to within a certain di&s;tance
from California; and from thence, following
the coa&s;t of New Spain, they arrive at Acapulco.
The&s;e ea&s;t winds blow not always from the &s;ame
point; but, in general, they blow from the
&s;outh-ea&s;t from April to September, and from
the north-ea&s;t from November to April.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t wind, by its con&s;tant action, aug|ments
the general motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t
to we&s;t. It al&s;o produces perpetual currents,
&s;ome of them running from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and
others from ea&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, or north-we&s;t, ac|cording
to the direction of the eminences, or
<PB N="371" REF="406">
chains of mountains, below the &s;urface, the
vallies or intervals between which &s;erving as
channels to the&s;e &s;ea-rivers. The variable
winds, which blow &s;ometimes from the ea&s;t,
and &s;ometimes from the &s;outh, likewi&s;e produce
currents, which change their direction with that
of the wind.</P>
<P>The winds that blow con&s;tantly for &s;ome
months are commonly &s;ucceeded by contrary
winds, which obliges the mariner to wait for
that which is mo&s;t favourable to his de&s;tination.
When the&s;e winds change, they often produce,
for &s;everal days, and &s;ometimes for a month, or

tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e general winds, occa&s;ioned by the ra|refaction
of the atmo&s;phere, are variou&s;ly com|bined
and modified by different cau&s;es, and in
different climates. In that part of the Atlantic
which lies under the Temperate Zone, the north
wind blows almo&s;t con&s;tantly during the months
of October, November, December, and January.
The&s;e months, therefore, are mo&s;t favourable
for &s;hips going to the Indies, which are carried
over the Line by this wind: And it is a well
known fact, that ve&s;&s;els which depart from Eu|rope
in March, frequently arrive not &s;ooner at
Bra&s;il than tho&s;e which &s;et out in the following
October. The north wind reigns almo&s;t perpe|tually,
during the winter, off Nova Zembla, and
other northern coa&s;ts. At Cape de Verd, the
<PB N="372" REF="407">
&s;outh wind blows, during the month of July,
which is the rainy &s;ea&s;on, or winter, in the&s;e
climates. At the Cape of Good Hope, the north-we&s;t
wind blows during the month of Septem|ber:
The &s;ame wind blows at Patna in the Ea&s;t
Indies, during the months of November, De|cember
and January, and occa&s;ion great rains;
but the ea&s;t wind prevails during the other nine
months. In the Indian Ocean, between Africa
and India, and as far as the Molucca i&s;lands,
the trade-wind from ea&s;t to we&s;t reigns from
January to the beginning of June; the we&s;t
winds begin in Augu&s;t or September; and, in
the interval between June and July, there are
dreadful tempe&s;ts, generally from the north
winds; but the&s;e winds are more variable on
the coa&s;ts than in the open &s;eas.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Guzarat, and upon the
neighbouring coa&s;ts, the north winds blow from
March to September; and, during the other
months, the &s;outh winds almo&s;t always prevail.
The Dutch, in returning from Java, &s;et out in
January or February, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
ea&s;t wind, which is felt as far as the 18th degree
of &s;outh latitude; and then they meet with &s;outh
winds, which carry them to St Helena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. cap. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some regular winds are produced by the
melting of the &s;nows. This was remarked by
the antient Greeks. During &s;ummer, a north-ea&s;t
wind, and a &s;outh-ea&s;t one during winter,
<PB N="373" REF="408">
was ob&s;erved to take place in Thracia, in Mace|donia,
in the Egean Sea, and even in Egypt
and Africa; and winds of the &s;ame kind have
been remarked in Congo, at Guzarat, and at the
extremity of Africa, which are all occa&s;ioned by
the melting of the &s;nows. Regular winds,
which la&s;t but a few hours, are al&s;o produced by
the motion of the tides; and, in many places, as
on the coa&s;ts of New Spain, of Congo, of Cuba,
&amp;c. a wind blows from the land during the
night, and from the &s;ea during the day.</P>
<P>The north winds are equally regular within
the polar circles; but they become more and
more imperceptible as we approach the Equa|tor:
This remark is applicable to both poles.</P>
<P>In the Atlantic and Aethiopic ocean, within
the tropics, an ea&s;t wind blows, through the
whole year, without any con&s;iderable variation,
excepting in &s;ome &s;mall &s;pots, where it changes
according to the &s;ituation of the coa&s;ts, and other
circum&s;tances: 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Near the coa&s;t of Africa, and
about the 28th degree of North latitude, ve&s;&s;els
are certain of finding a fre&s;h gale from the
north-ea&s;t, or north-north-ea&s;t, which accom|panies
them to the 10th degree of the &s;ame la|titude,
about 100 leagues from the coa&s;t of
Guinea; and, at the 4th degree of north latitude,
they meet with calms and tornadoes. 2<HI>d,</HI> In
going by the Caribbee i&s;lands, this wind turns
more and more ea&s;terly, in proportion as the
ve&s;&s;els approach the American coa&s;t. 3<HI>d,</HI> The
<PB N="374" REF="409">
limits of the&s;e variable winds, in the Atlantic,
are more exten&s;ive upon the coa&s;ts of America
than upon tho&s;e of Africa. Along the coa&s;t of
Guinea, from Sierra Leona to the i&s;land of St
Thomas, an extent of about 500 leagues, there
is a perpetual &s;outh, or &s;outh-we&s;t wind. The
narrowe&s;t part of the Atlantic is from the coa&s;t
of Guinea to Bra&s;il, where it is not above 500
leagues over. Ve&s;&s;els, however, that depart
from Guinea, are obliged to &s;hape their cour&s;e
&s;outhward, e&s;pecially when they &s;et out in the
months of July or Augu&s;t, in order to fall in
with the &s;outh-ea&s;t winds, which blow con&s;tant|ly
during this &s;ea&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. abridg. vol. 2. p. 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Mediterranean, the ea&s;t wind blows
from the land in the evening, and the we&s;t wind
from the &s;ea in the morning. The &s;outh wind,
which is accompanied with rain, and blows
commonly during the latter end of autumn, at
Paris, in Burgundy, and Champagne, yields to a
mild north wind, which produces that fine
weather vulgarly called Saint Martin's Sum|mer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Trait&eacute; des eaux de M. Mariotte.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Doctor Li&s;ter alledges, that the ea&s;t wind,
which reigns during the whole year between
the tropics, is occa&s;ioned by the tran&s;piration of
the plant called the <HI>&s;ea-lentil,</HI> which abounds in
the&s;e climates; and that the difference of land|winds
is owing to the different &s;ituation of trees
<PB N="375" REF="410">
and fore&s;ts. This ridiculous whim he a&s;&s;igns
as the cau&s;e of the winds; and, in his opinion,
the wind is &s;tronge&s;t at mid-day, becau&s;e the
tran&s;piration from plants is then the greate&s;t;
and the wind, continues he, blows from ea&s;t
to we&s;t, becau&s;e all plants are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
&s;un-flowers, and tran&s;pire mo&s;t from the &s;ide
oppo&s;ite to the &s;un<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. No. 156.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Other authors have a&s;&s;igned the diurnal mo|tion
of the earth as the cau&s;e of this ea&s;t wind.
This notion is &s;pecious: But every man, who
has the lea&s;t knowledge of phy&s;ics, mu&s;t allow,
that no fluid which &s;urrounds the earth can be
affected by its rotation; that the air mu&s;t move
along with the earth it&s;elf; and that the rota|tory
motion is equally imperceptible in the at|mo&s;phere,
as on the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>The principal cau&s;e of the winds, as already
remarked, is the heat of the &s;un<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Halley's treati&s;e on this &s;ubject in the Phil. Tran&s;.</NOTE>; for, what|ever
rarefies or conden&s;es the air, mu&s;t produce
a wind or current in a direction oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e
places where the rarefaction or conden&s;ation is
greate&s;t.</P>
<P>The pre&s;&s;ure of clouds, exhalations from the
earth, the explo&s;ion of meteors, rains, &amp;c. like|wi&s;e
produce con&s;iderable agitations in the at|mo&s;phere.
Each of the&s;e cau&s;es, when variou&s;|ly
combined, produce different effects. As it is
in vain to attempt a compleat theory of the
winds, I confine my&s;elf to their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="411">
If we had a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations upon the di|rection,
the force, and the variations of the winds
in the different climates of the earth, and if the&s;e
ob&s;ervations were &s;ufficiently numerous and ex|act,
we might be enabled to form more compleat
ideas with regard to the cau&s;es of the different
changes in the atmo&s;phere, than we at pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>The winds are more regular at &s;ea than upon
land; becau&s;e their motion is not interrupted.
But, upon land, the direction is often changed
by the interpo&s;ition of mountains, fore&s;ts, cities,
and other ob&s;tacles. Winds are often reflected
from mountains with a force nearly equal to that
of their original current: The&s;e winds are exceed|ingly
irregular, becau&s;e their direction depends
on the contour, the height, and the &s;ituation of
the mountains from which they rebound. The
&s;ea-winds al&s;o blow with more force and uni|formity,
and la&s;t longer: The land-winds, how|ever
violent, have intermi&s;&s;ions and moments of
repo&s;e: But, at &s;ea, the current of the air, ha|ving
no ob&s;tacles to contend with, is uniform
and perpetual.</P>
<P>At &s;ea, the ea&s;t winds, and tho&s;e which come
from the Poles, are generally &s;tronger than the
we&s;t winds, and tho&s;e that proceed from the E|quator.
But, at land, the &s;outh and we&s;t winds
are more or le&s;s violent, according to the differ|ent
&s;ituation of particular countries. During
&s;pring and autumn, the winds, both at &s;ea and
<PB N="377" REF="412">
land, are more violent than in &s;ummer or win|ter.
For this, &s;everal rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned:
1. In &s;pring and autumn the tides are highe&s;t;
and, con&s;equently, the winds they excite are
mo&s;t violent during the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons: 2. The mo|tion
produced in the atmo&s;phere by the action
of the &s;un and moon, or the tides of the air, mu&s;t
likewi&s;e be greate&s;t at the equinoxial &s;ea&s;ons:
3. The melting of the &s;nows in &s;pring, and the
conden&s;ation of the vapours exhaled in &s;ummer
by the &s;un, and which fall down in the autumn
in the form of rain, produce, or, at lea&s;t, aug|ment
the force of the winds. 4. The tran&s;ition
from heat to cold, or from cold to heat, mu&s;t
create con&s;iderable augmentation and diminu|tion
in the volume of the air, which alone is &s;uf|ficient
to rai&s;e great winds.</P>
<P>Contrary currents in the atmo&s;phere have oft|en
been remarked. We &s;ee &s;ome clouds mo|ving
in one direction, and others, either above
or below them, proceeding in a direction per|fectly
oppo&s;ite. This contrariety of motion ne|ver
continues long; becau&s;e its general cau&s;e is
the re&s;i&s;tence of &s;ome large cloud, which reflects
the wind in a direction oppo&s;ite to its natural
cour&s;e, but is &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>The winds are more violent in proportion to
the elevation of the ground, till it arrive at the
ordinary &s;tation of the clouds, which is about
one-fourth or one-third of a league perpendi|cular
height; and beyond this, the &s;ky is gene|rally
<PB N="378" REF="413">
&s;erene, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, and the wind
gradually dimini&s;hes: It is even &s;aid to be alto|gether
imperceptible on the tops of the highe&s;t
mountains. However, as the &s;ummits of the&s;e
mountains are covered with ice and &s;now, it is
natural to think, that this region of the air is
agitated during the fall of the &s;nows, and, that
the winds are only imperceptible in the &s;ummer
&s;ea&s;on. The light vapours which are rai&s;ed in
&s;ummer fall in the form of dews; but, in winter,
they are conden&s;ed, and fall on the tops of the
mountains in the form of &s;now or ice, which
may rai&s;e con&s;iderable winds at that altitude.</P>
<P>The celerity of a current of air is augmented
when its pa&s;&s;age is contracted. The &s;ame wind,
which is but &s;lightly felt in a large open plain, be|comes
violent in going through a narrow pa&s;s in
a mountain, or between two high hou&s;es; and it
is mo&s;t violent at the tops of the buildings or of
the mountain, becau&s;e the air being compre&s;&s;ed
by the&s;e ob&s;tacles, is augmented both in volume
and den&s;ity; and, as its celerity remains the
&s;ame, its force or momentum mu&s;t be increa&s;ed.
It is for this rea&s;on that the wind appears to be
more violent near a church or a tour than at a
di&s;tance from them. I have often remarked,
that the wind reflected from a building &s;tand|ing
by it&s;elf is &s;tronger than the direct wind
which produced it. This effect can be owing to
no other cau&s;e than the compre&s;&s;ion of the air
again&s;t the building from which it rebounds.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="414">
As the den&s;ity of the air is greate&s;t at the
&s;urface of the earth, it is natural to conclude,
that the wind mu&s;t there al&s;o be mo&s;t violent;
and this conclu&s;ion is, I apprehend, ju&s;t, when
the &s;ky is &s;erene: But, when it is charged with
clouds, the action of the wind will be mo&s;t vio|lent
at the height of the clouds, which are den|&s;er
than air, as they fall in the form of rain or
of hail. In computing the force of wind, there|fore,
we ought to e&s;timate not only its veloci|ty,
but likewi&s;e the den&s;ity of the air; for, two
winds of equal velocities may differ greatly in
their force, if the den&s;ities of the air be unequal.
From this remark, we may learn the imperfec|tion
of tho&s;e machines which have been em|ployed
for mea&s;uring the velocity of the winds.</P>
<P>Particular winds, whether they be direct or
reflected, are more violent than tho&s;e that are
general. The interrupted action of land-winds
depends on the compre&s;&s;ion of the air, which
renders every bla&s;t more violent than if the cur|rent
were uniform. A uniformly continued
&s;tream of air produces not &s;uch havock as the
fury of tho&s;e winds which blow, as it were, by
paroxy&s;ins. But of this we &s;hall treat more fully
in the next article.</P>
<P>The winds, in their various directions, may
be con&s;idered under general points of view,
from which, perhaps, &s;ome u&s;eful deductions
may be drawn. For example, the winds may
be divided into Zones. The ea&s;t wind, which
<PB N="380" REF="415">
extends 25 or 30 degrees on each &s;ide of the
Equator, exerts its force round the globe within
the Torrid Zone. The north wind blows with
equal con&s;tancy in both the Frigid Zones. Thus,
the ea&s;t wind occupies the Torrid Zone, and the
north wind the Frigid Zones. With regard to
the Temperate Zones, the winds peculiar to
them may be con&s;idered only as currents of air,
produced by the combination of the two princi|pal
winds, which gives ri&s;e to all tho&s;e that
come from the ea&s;tern points; and the we&s;t
winds, which are common in the Temperate
Zones, both in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,
may be con&s;idered as reflections from the con|tinents
of A&s;ia and America, but deriving their
origin principally from the ea&s;t and north winds.</P>
<P>Though we have &s;aid, that, generally &s;peak|ing,
the ea&s;t wind blows round the globe 25 or
30 degrees on each &s;ide of the Equator; yet it
mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, in &s;ome places, it
extends not &s;o far, and that its direction is not
throughout from ea&s;t to we&s;t; for, on this &s;ide
of the Equator, it is ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, and, beyond
the Equator, it is ea&s;t-&s;outh-ea&s;t, and, the more
we recede from the Equator, its direction is the
more oblique. The Equator is the line under
which the direction of the wind from ea&s;t to
we&s;t is mo&s;t exact. In the Indian Ocean, for
example, the general wind from ea&s;t to we&s;t ex|tends
not above 15 degrees beyond the Equator.
In going from Goa to the Cape of Good Hope,
<PB N="381" REF="416">
this wind is not felt beyond the 12th degree of
&s;outh latitude, nor is it perceptible on this &s;ide
of the Equator. But, after arriving at the 12th
degree of &s;outh latitude, this wind continues to
the 28th degree. In the &s;ea which &s;eparates A|frica
from america, there is an interval from the
4th degree of north latitude to the 10th or 11th
of &s;outh latitude, where this general wind is not
perceived. But, beyond the 10th or 11th de|gree,
it extends to the 30th.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e many deviations in the
trade-winds, which have an alternate motion.
Some continue for a longer or &s;horter time; o|thers
have a greater or le&s;&s;er extent; others are
more or le&s;s regular, and more or le&s;s violent.
The following, according to Varenius, are the
principal phaenomena of the&s;e winds. 'In the
ocean between Africa and India, and as far as
the Molucca i&s;lands, the ea&s;t wind commences
in January, and continues to the beginning of
June. In the month of Augu&s;t, the we&s;t wind
begins, and continues for three or four months.
In the interval between the&s;e trade-winds,
which is between the end of June and the be|ginning
of Augu&s;t, the &s;ea is infe&s;ted with vi|olent
tempe&s;ts from the north.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e winds are &s;ubject to the greate&s;t va|riations
near the coa&s;ts: Ve&s;&s;els cannot take
their departure from the coa&s;t of Malabar, and
other ports on the we&s;t coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula
of India, to Africa, Arabia, or Per&s;ia, but from
<PB N="382" REF="417">
the month of January to April or May; for,
at the end of May, and during the months of
June, July, and Augu&s;t, the tempe&s;ts from
the north and north-ea&s;t are &s;o violent, that
no &s;hips can keep the &s;eas. But, on the o|ther
&s;ide of this penin&s;ula, in the &s;ea which
wa&s;hes the coa&s;t of Coromandel, there are no
tempe&s;ts of this kind.'</P>
<P>'Ve&s;&s;els depart from Java, Ceylon, and &s;e|veral
other places, for the Molucca's in Sep|tember,
becau&s;e the we&s;t wind begins then to
blow in the&s;e regions. However, when 15
degrees &s;outh of the Equator, this wind cea&s;es,
and they fall in with the trade-wind, which,
in this place, blows from the &s;outh-ea&s;t. In
the &s;ame manner, ve&s;&s;els depart from Cochin
for Malacca in March; becau&s;e, at this time,
the we&s;t wind begins to blow. Thus the we&s;t
winds ari&s;e at different times, in different parts
of the Indian Ocean. The times of departure
are different from Java to the Molucca's, from
Cochin to Malacca, from Malacca to China,
and from China to Japan.'</P>
<P>'At Banda, the we&s;t winds terminate at the
end of March; calm and variable winds occu|py
the month of April; and the ea&s;t winds
begin with great violence in May. At Cey|lon,
the we&s;t winds commence about the mid|dle
of March, and continue to the beginning
of October, when the ea&s;t, or rather ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t
winds return. At Madaga&s;car, they have
<PB N="383" REF="418">
north or morth-we&s;t winds from the middle
of April to the end of May; but ea&s;t and
&s;outh winds in February and March. From
Madaga&s;car to the Cape of Good Hope, the
northerly winds prevail during the months of
March and April. In the gulf of Bengal, af|ter
the 20th of April, the &s;outh winds blow
with violence; and, before this period, the
&s;outh-we&s;t and north-we&s;t winds prevail. The
we&s;terly winds are al&s;o violent in the Chine&s;e
&s;ea during the months of June and July. This
is, therefore, the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;ail|ing
from China to Japan: But, in returning
from Japan to China, February and March are
preferable, becau&s;e the ea&s;terly winds then
prevail.'</P>
<P>'There are &s;ome winds which may be con|&s;idered
as peculiar to certain coa&s;ts: For ex|ample,
a &s;outh wind blows almo&s;t perpetually
on the coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru. It begins a|bout
the 46th degree of &s;outh latitude, and ex|tends
beyond Panama, which makes the voy|age
from Lima to Panama more ea&s;y and ex|peditious
than the return. The we&s;terly winds
blow almo&s;t continually on the coa&s;ts of Ma|gellan's
land, in the neighbourhood of the
&s;traits of Le Maire. Upon the Malabar coa&s;t,
they have almo&s;t con&s;tantly north and north|we&s;t
winds. The north wind is very frequent
on the coa&s;t of Guinea. The we&s;terly winds
<PB N="384" REF="419">
reign upon the coa&s;ts of Japan during the
months of November and December.'</P>
<P>The periodic, or alternate winds, mentioned
above, are peculiar to the &s;ea. But, upon land,
there are al&s;o periodic winds, which return at
certain &s;ea&s;ons, or particular days, or even at
&s;tated hours. On the coa&s;t of Malabar, for ex|ample,
an ea&s;terly land-wind blows from Sep|tember
to April: It generally commences at
midnight, and ends at noon; and it is not percep|tible
at 12 or 15 leagues from the coa&s;t. From
noon to midnight, there is a gentle we&s;terly
breeze from the &s;ea. Upon the coa&s;ts of New
Spain in America, and upon tho&s;e of Congo
in Africa, land-winds blow during the night,
and &s;ea-winds during the day. Winds blow
from all the coa&s;ts of Jamaica during the night,
which prevents the landing, or &s;ailing of &s;hips,
with &s;afety, before the ri&s;ing of the &s;un.</P>
<P>In winter, the port of Cochin is inacce&s;&s;ible;
neither can any ve&s;&s;el get out; becau&s;e the winds
are &s;o impetuous, that no ve&s;&s;els can keep the
&s;ea; and, be&s;ides, the we&s;t wind, which blows
with great fury, drives &s;uch a quantity of &s;and
into the mouth of the river, as renders it impo&s;|&s;ible
for &s;hips of any burden to enter it for &s;ix
months of the year. But the ea&s;t wind, which
blows during the other &s;ix months, drives back
the &s;and into the &s;ea, and opens the mouth of
the river. At the &s;traits of Babelmandel, there
blows a &s;outh-ea&s;t wind, which is regularly &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="385" REF="420">
by the north-ea&s;t. At Saint Domingo,
there are two different winds which ri&s;e regu|larly
every day; the one, which is from the &s;ea,
comes from the ea&s;t, and begins at 10 o'clock
before noon; the other, which is a land-wind
from the we&s;t, ri&s;es at 6 or 7 in the evening,
and continues the whole night. Other facts of
this kind, collected from voyagers of knowledge
and credit, might furni&s;h a compleat hi&s;tory of
the winds, which would be a work extremely
u&s;eful both to navigation and phy&s;ics.</P>

<P>THE winds are more irregular on the land
than on the &s;ea, and in high than in low
countries. The mountains not only change the
direction of the winds, but even produce &s;ome,
which are either con&s;tant or variable, according
to their cau&s;es. The melting of &s;nows on the
tops of the mountains generally give ri&s;e to
con&s;tant winds which la&s;t a con&s;iderable time.
The vapours which &s;trike again&s;t the mountains,
and accumulate upon them, produce variable
winds, which are very common in all climates;
and there is as great a variety in the motions of
<PB N="387" REF="422">
the air, as there are inequalities on the &s;urface
of the earth. We can only, therefore, give ex|amples
and genuine hi&s;tory of facts: And, as

of the winds, and even of the &s;ea&s;ons,
in different countries, is &s;till wanting, we &s;hall
not attempt to explain all the cau&s;es of the&s;e va|riations,
but &s;hall confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e which
are mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>In &s;traits, at the extremities of promontories,
penin&s;ula's, and capes, and in all narrow bays,
tempe&s;tuous winds are frequent. But, indepen|dent
of the&s;e, &s;ome &s;eas are much more infe&s;ted

the &s;eas of Japan and of Magellan, along the Afri|can
coa&s;t beyond the Canaries, and the oppo&s;ite
coa&s;t near Natal, and the Red and Vermilion
Seas, are all &s;ubject to tempe&s;ts. The Atlantic
is likewi&s;e more tempe&s;tuous than the great o|cean
called the Pacific: This ocean, however,
is no where perfectly tranquil, but between the
Tropics; for the nearer we approach the poles,
it is the more &s;ubject to variable winds, the &s;ud|den
changes of which produce tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>All continents are &s;ubject to the effects of va|riable
winds, which are &s;ometimes very &s;ingu|lar.
In the kingdom of Ca&s;&s;imir, which is &s;ur|rounded
with the mountains of Cauca&s;us, a mo&s;t
&s;udden rever&s;e of &s;ea&s;ons is felt on Mount Pire|penjale.
In le&s;s than an hour's journey, we pa&s;s
from &s;ummer to winter: A north and a &s;outh
<PB N="388" REF="423">
wind, according to Bernier, blow perceptibly
within 200 paces of each other. The po&s;ition
of this mountain mu&s;t be &s;ingular; and, there|fore,
it merits a particular examination. In the
penin&s;ula of India, which is traver&s;ed from north
to &s;outh by the mountains of Gate, the extreme
heats of &s;ummer are felt on one &s;ide of tho&s;e moun|tains,
and all the rigours of winter on the other.
The &s;ame phaenomenon takes place on the two
oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts of Cape Ro&s;algate in Arabia:
On the north coa&s;t the &s;ea is calm and tranquil;
while the &s;outh coa&s;t is infe&s;ted with continual
&s;torms. Geylon exhibits another example of
this phaenomenon; winter and high winds
reign in the north part of the i&s;land, while, on
the &s;outh &s;ide of it, fine weather and &s;ummer
heats prevail. Of oppo&s;ite &s;ea&s;ons in the neigh|bourhood
of each other, and at the &s;ame time,
there are &s;everal examples, not only on the con|tinent,
but on the i&s;lands, as at Cerem, a long
i&s;land near Amboyna, in the north part of which
it is winter, and &s;ummer in the &s;outh part; and
the interval between the&s;e two &s;ea&s;ons is not a|bove
three or four leagues.</P>
<P>In Egypt a &s;outh wind prevails in &s;ummer,
which is &s;o hot as to &s;top re&s;piration; and it
rai&s;es &s;uch immen&s;e quantities of &s;and, that the
&s;ky &s;eems to be covered with thick clouds. This
&s;and is &s;o fine, and is blown with &s;uch violence,
that it penetrates the clo&s;e&s;t che&s;ts. When the&s;e
winds continue for &s;everal days, they give ri&s;e
<PB N="389" REF="424">
to epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, which frequently cut off
va&s;t numbers of men. It &s;eldom rains in Egypt;
every year, however, there are &s;ome days of rain
in the months of December, January, and Fe|bruary.
But thick fogs are more frequent than
rain, e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of Cairo.
The&s;e fogs commence in November, and con|tinue
during the winter; and, through the whole
year, even when the &s;ky is &s;erene, the dews fall
&s;o copiou&s;ly, that they have all the effects of
rain.</P>
<P>In Per&s;ia, the winter commences in Novem|ber,
and la&s;ts till March. The cold is &s;trong e|nough
to produce ice; and &s;nows fall in the
mountains, and &s;ometimes in the plains. From
March to May, they have violent winds, which
recal the warmth of &s;ummer. From May to
September the &s;ky is &s;erene, and the heats are
moderated during the night by fre&s;h breezes
which continue till morning; and, in autumn,
they have violent winds, like tho&s;e which blow in
the &s;pring. However, though the&s;e winds are
very &s;trong, they &s;eldom produce tempe&s;ts or
hurricanes. But, in &s;ummer, a very noxious
wind blows along the Per&s;ic Gulf, which is call|ed
<HI>Samiel</HI> by the natives; it is &s;till hotter and
more terrible than that of Egypt; and acting
like an explo&s;ion of inflamed vapour, it &s;u&s;&s;o|cates
every per&s;on who unhappily falls within
its vortex. A &s;imilar wind ri&s;es in &s;ummer a|long
the Red Sea, which &s;u&s;&s;ocates animals, and
<PB N="390" REF="425">
tran&s;ports &s;uch quantities of &s;and, that many
people imagine this &s;ea will, in the cour&s;e
of time, be compleatly filled up with it. Ara|bia
gives birth to frequent clouds of &s;and which
darken the air, and excite dangerous whirlwinds.
At Vera Cruz, when the hot winds blow from
the north, the hou&s;es of that town are almo&s;t
buried with &s;and. Hot winds are al&s;o felt in
&s;ummer at Negapatan in India, and likewi&s;e at
Petapouli and Ma&s;ulapatan. The&s;e &s;corching
winds which kill men, are fortunately of no long
duration; but they are extremely violent, and
their heat and deleterious quality are propor|tioned
to their velocity; which is contrary to
the nature of other winds; for the more their
rapidity, they are the more whole&s;ome and re|fre&s;hing.
This difference proceeds from the de|gree
of heat in the air. When the heat of the
air is le&s;s than that of the body, the motion of
the air is agreeable. But, when the heat of the
air is greater than that of the bodies of animals,
its motion &s;corches and &s;u&s;&s;ocates. At Goa, the
winter, or rather the rainy and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea|&s;on,
is in the months of May, June, and July;
it cools and refre&s;hes the air, which would o|therwi&s;e
be perfectly in&s;upportable in that re|gion.</P>
<P>The Cape of Good Hope is famous for its
tempe&s;ts, and a peculiar cloud which produces
them. This cloud at fir&s;t appears like a &s;mall
round &s;pot in the heavens, which mariners di|&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="391" REF="426">
by the name of the <HI>Ox's Eye.</HI> The
&s;eeming &s;mallne&s;s of this cloud is probably ow|ing
to its great height. Of all voyagers who
mention this cloud, Kolbe appears to have ex|amined
it with the greate&s;t attention. 'This
cloud,' &s;ays he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 224.</NOTE>, 'which appears on the moun|tains
of the <HI>Table,</HI> or of the <HI>Devil,</HI> or of the
<HI>Wind,</HI> is compo&s;ed, if I am not deceived, of an
infinite number of particles pu&s;hed, in the fir&s;t
place, again&s;t the mountains to the ea&s;t of the
Cape, by the ea&s;t wind which blows in the
Torrid Zone during almo&s;t the whole year.
The&s;e particles or vapours are &s;topped by the
high mountains, and are collected on their
ea&s;t &s;ide. They then become vi&s;ible in the
form of &s;mall fragments of clouds, which, by
the con&s;tant action of the ea&s;t wind, are ele|vated
to the tops of the mountains. Here
they remain not long at re&s;t; but, being for|ced
to advance, they &s;ink down between the
mountains that are &s;till before them, where
they are locked up and &s;queezed on all &s;ides
as in a canal. The wind pre&s;&s;es the&s;e vapours
from above, and the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the two
mountains confine them on the right and left,
till, in their progre&s;s, they advance to the foot
of &s;ome mountain where the country is more flat
and open; they then expand, and become
again invi&s;ible. But they are &s;oon pu&s;hed
again&s;t another ridge of mountains by fre&s;h
<PB N="392" REF="427">
clouds coming up behind them; and in this
manner they proceed till they arrive with va&s;t
impetuo&s;ity at the top of the highe&s;t moun|tains
of the Cape, which are tho&s;e of the
<HI>Wind</HI> or of the <HI>Table,</HI> where they are met by a
wind blowing in the very oppo&s;ite direction.
Here a dreadful conflict en&s;ues. The vapours
are pre&s;&s;ed both before and behind, which pro|duces
terrible whirlwinds, either on the moun|tains
of the <HI>Table,</HI> or in the vallies. When the
north-we&s;t wind yields, that of the &s;outh-ea&s;t
increa&s;es, and continues to blow with more or
le&s;s violence for &s;ix months. When the <HI>Ox's
Eye</HI> is thick, the force of the &s;outh-ea&s;t wind
augments, becau&s;e the vapours ama&s;&s;ed behind
the mountains continually pre&s;s forward; for
the &s;ame rea&s;on, this wind dimini&s;hes when
the <HI>Ox's Eye</HI> is thin; and it entirely cea&s;es
when the <HI>Ox's Eye</HI> vani&s;hes, becau&s;e no va|pours
arrive from the ea&s;t.'</P>
<P>'The circum&s;tances attending this phaeno|menon
lead to the following hypothe&s;is:
1. Behind the mountain of the <HI>Table,</HI> a train
of thin white vapour is ob&s;erved, which com|mences
on the ea&s;tern declivity of this moun|tain,
ends in a &s;harp point at the &s;ea, and occu|pies,
in its extent, the whole mountains of
<HI>Stone.</HI> I have often contemplated this train,
and imagined it to originate from the rapid
motion of the vapour above de&s;cribed, from
the mountains of <HI>Stone</HI> to that of the <HI>Table.</HI>'</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="428">
'2. The pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e vapours mu&s;t be ex|tremely
embarra&s;&s;ed by the contrary &s;hocks
received, not only from the mountains, but
from the &s;outh and ea&s;t winds which prevail
in the neighbourhood of the Cape. I have al|ready
mentioned the two mountains &s;ituated
on the points of <HI>Fal&s;e bay,</HI> the one called the
<HI>Hanging Lip,</HI> the other the <HI>Norvege.</HI> When
the particles or vapours, which I have conjec|tured,
are pu&s;hed again&s;t tho&s;e mountains by
the ea&s;t winds, they are repelled by the &s;outh
winds, and driven again&s;t the neighbouring
mountains, where they are detained for &s;ome
time, and appear like clouds, as they often do
upon the mountains of <HI>Fal&s;e bay,</HI> and even be|yond
them. The&s;e clouds are frequently very
thick above the land in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch,
upon the mountains of <HI>Stellenbo&s;ck,</HI> of <HI>Draken|&s;tein,</HI>
and of <HI>Stone,</HI> but e&s;pecially upon the
mountains of the <HI>Table</HI> and of the <HI>Devil.</HI>'</P>
<P>'La&s;tly, The con&s;tant appearance of &s;mall
black clouds upon the <HI>Lion's Head</HI> two or three
days before the &s;outh-ea&s;t winds blow, con|firms
me in my conjecture; for the&s;e clouds,
in my opinion, are compo&s;ed of the particles
or vapour mentioned above. If the north-we&s;t
wind prevails when the&s;e particles arrive,
their cour&s;e is &s;topped; but they are never
driven to any great di&s;tance till the &s;outh-ea&s;t
wind commences.'</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="429">
The navigators who fir&s;t approached the Cape
of Good Hope, were ignorant of the effects of
the&s;e clouds, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e &s;lowly and
without any agitation in the air, but which, in
a moment, excite the mo&s;t furious tempe&s;ts, and
precipitate the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els to the bottom of
the ocean. In the country of Natal, a cloud &s;i|milar
to the Ox's Eye at the Cape, produces the
&s;ame direful effects. The&s;e &s;pecies of tempe&s;ts
are frequent in the Atlantic, e&s;pecially in the
neighbourhood of the Equator. Near the coa&s;t
of Guiney, three or four of the&s;e &s;torms &s;ome|times
happen in a day, which are likewi&s;e occa|&s;ioned
and announced by &s;mall black clouds,
while the re&s;t of the &s;ky is generally &s;erene,
and the &s;ea perfectly calm. It is principally in
April, May, and June, that the&s;e furious &s;torms
ari&s;e along the coa&s;t of Guiney, becau&s;e no re|gular
winds blow there at that &s;ea&s;on. On the
coa&s;t of Loango, the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on is in the months
of January, February, March, and April. At
Cape Gardafu, on the other &s;ide of Africa, they
have &s;torms of this kind in May, and the clouds
which produce them are generally in the north,
like tho&s;e of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;torms originate from winds that i&s;|&s;ue
from a cloud; and their direction is from
north to &s;outh, or from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t,
&amp;c. But there are tempe&s;ts of another kind,
called Whirlwinds, which are &s;till more violent,
and in which the wind &s;eems to blow from e|very
<PB N="395" REF="430">
quarter at once. Their motion is circular,
and nothing can re&s;i&s;t their fury. They are ge|nerally
preceded by a dead calm; but, in an
in&s;tant, the waves are elevated to the clouds by
the fury of the winds. Some parts of the &s;ea
cannot be approached; becau&s;e they are perpe|tually
infe&s;ted either with calms or whirlwinds.
The&s;e places have been called <HI>calms</HI> and <HI>torna|dos</HI>
by the Spaniards. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable
of them are near Guiney, about the 2d or 3d
degree of north latitude. They extend about
300 or 350 leagues in length, and nearly as
much in breadth, which includes a &s;pace of more
than 100,000 &s;quare leagues.</P>
<P>When contrary winds arrive at the &s;ame
time in the &s;ame place, they produce whirlwinds,
by the oppo&s;ite motion of the air, in the &s;ame
manner as whirlpools are produced in the &s;ea
by contrary currents. But, when tho&s;e oppo|&s;ite
winds are counterbalanced by their di&s;tant
action upon each other, they then revolve in a
great circle, and produce a perfect calm, which
it is impo&s;&s;ible for ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s through. The&s;e
places are all marked in the globes of Mr Se|nex.
I am inclined to think, that the contrariety
of the winds alone, if not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the direc|tion
of the coa&s;ts, and the particular &s;tructure
of the bottom of the &s;ea in the&s;e places, could
not produce this effect. I imagine that the cur|rents,
which are in effect occa&s;ioned by the
winds, but a&s;&s;ume their direction from the fi|gure
<PB N="396" REF="431">
of the coa&s;ts and the inequalities at the
bottom, terminate in the&s;e places; and that their
oppo&s;ite motions, in a plain &s;urrounded with a
chain of mountains, give ri&s;e to the tornados in
que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Whirlpools &s;eem to be nothing el&s;e but cir|cular
motions of the waters occa&s;ioned by the
action of two or more oppo&s;ite currents. The
Euripus, &s;o famed by the death of Ari&s;totle, al|ternately
ab&s;orbs and rejects the water &s;even
times every 24 hours. This whirlpool is near
the coa&s;t of Greece. Charybdis, which lies near
the &s;traits of Sicily, rejects and ab&s;orbs the wa|ter
thrice in 24 hours. We are uncertain as to
the number of alternate motions in other whirl|pools.
Dr Placentia informs us, that the mo|tions
of the Euripus are irregular for 18 or 19
days every month, and regular during the other
11; and that it &s;eldom &s;wells above one, or at
mo&s;t two feet. He farther informs us, that au|thors
are not agreed as to the tides in the Eu|ripus;
that &s;ome &s;ay it is twice, others &s;even
times, &s;ome eleven, others 12 or 14 times in
24 hours; but that Loirius, who examined it
attentively, found that the tides ro&s;e regularly e|very
&s;ix hours, and that their motion was &s;uffi|cient
to turn a mill-wheel.</P>
<P>The large&s;t known whirlpool is in the &s;ea of
Norway, the circumference of which exceeds
20 leagues. It ab&s;orbs, for &s;ix hours, water,
whales, &s;hips, and any thing that approaches it,
<PB N="397" REF="432">
and the next &s;ix hours are employed in throwing
them up again.</P>
<P>To account for the&s;e whirlpools, it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to have recour&s;e to an aby&s;s, or to pits in
the bottom of the &s;ea, which are perpetually
&s;wallowing the waters. It is well known, that,
when water has two directions, the combination
of the&s;e motions produces a whirling, and exhi|bits
the appearance of a void &s;pace in the middle.
In the &s;ame manner, whirlpools in the &s;ea are
occa&s;ioned by two or more contrary currents;
and, as the tides are the principal cau&s;e of cur|rents,
and, of cour&s;e, they run for &s;ix hours in
contrary directions, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the
whirlpools which are produced by them &s;hould
alternately reject and ab&s;orb every thing within
their reach during the &s;ame portions of time.</P>
<P>Whirlpools, then, are occa&s;ioned by contrary
currents, and whirlwinds by the conflict of
contrary winds. The&s;e whirlwinds are com|mon
in the Chine&s;e and Japane&s;e &s;eas, near the
Antilles, and in many other places of the ocean,
particularly in the neighbourhood of prominent
coa&s;ts. But they are &s;till more frequent upon
land; and their effects are &s;ometimes prodigious.
'I have &s;een,' &s;ays Bellarmin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De A&s;cen&s;u Mentis in Deum</NOTE>, 'an enormous
ditch &s;cooped out by the wind, tran&s;ported in
the air, and dropped upon a village, which was
for ever buried under this load of earth.' A
detail of the effects of &s;everal hurricanes may be
<PB N="398" REF="433">
&s;een in the hi&s;tory of the French Academy, and
in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, which would
appear altogether inconceivable, if they were not
atte&s;ted by intelligent and credible &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made with re|gard
to water-&s;pouts, which the mariner never
beholds without terror and amazement. They
are very common on certain coa&s;ts of the Medi|terranean,
e&s;pecially when the weather is cloudy,
and the wind blows from &s;everal coa&s;ts at the
&s;ame time. They are more frequent near the
coa&s;ts of Laodicea, of Grecgo, and of Carmel,
than in any other part of the Mediterranean.
Mo&s;t of them are large cylinders of water which
fall from the clouds, though, at a di&s;tance, the
water appears to ri&s;e up from the &s;ea to the
clouds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there are two &s;pecies of water-&s;pouts;
the fir&s;t is that we have ju&s;t mentioned, and is
nothing but a thick cloud compre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ur|rounded
by oppo&s;ite winds blowing from dif|ferent
coa&s;ts at the &s;ame time, which make it
a&s;&s;ume a cylindric figure, and fall down by its
own gravity. The quantity of water is &s;o im|men&s;e,
and the rapidity of the fall &s;o great, that
if, unfortunately, one of the&s;e &s;pouts break up|on
a &s;hip, it da&s;hes it to pieces, and &s;inks it in
an in&s;tant. It is alledged, and with probability,
that water-&s;pouts may be broken and di&s;&s;ipated
by the commotion excited in the air by the
<PB N="399" REF="434">
firing of cannons, which corre&s;ponds with the
di&s;&s;ipation of thunder-clouds by the ringing of
bells.</P>
<P>The other &s;pecies of water-&s;pout is called a
<HI>typhon,</HI> and is very frequent in the Chine&s;e Sea.
The typhon de&s;cends not from the clouds, nor
is produced by the action of oppo&s;ite winds. It,
on the contrary, ri&s;es from the water to the
heavens with amazing rapidity. Whirlwinds
often run along con&s;iderable tracts, bearing
down hou&s;es, trees, and every ob&s;tacle that they
meet with. But typhons remain always in the
&s;ame places, and can be owing to nothing but
&s;ubterraneous fires; for the &s;ea is then in the
greate&s;t agitation, and the air is &s;o impregnated
with &s;ulphureous exhalations, that the &s;ky ap|pears
to be covered with a copper-coloured cru&s;t,
although there be no clouds, and the &s;un or the
&s;tars appear through the vapour. It is to the&s;e
&s;ubterranean fires that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the warmth
of the Chine&s;e Sea in winter, where the&s;e ty|phons
are very frequent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Acta erud. Lip&s;. &s;upplem. tom. 1. p. 405.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thevenote, in his voyage to the ea&s;t, gives
the following account of water-&s;pouts: 'We &s;aw
water-&s;pouts in the Per&s;ic gulf, between the
i&s;lands of Que&s;omo, Lareca, and Ormutz. Few
have had the opportunity, and fewer &s;till have
paid the attention to water-&s;pouts, that I have
done. I &s;hall de&s;cribe them with per&s;picuity
<PB N="400" REF="435">
and &s;implicity, in order to render my account
the more ea&s;ily intelligible.'</P>
<P>'The fir&s;t that we &s;aw, was on the north &s;ide
between us and the i&s;land of Que&s;omo, about
a gun-&s;hot from our &s;hip. In this place, we
&s;aw the water begin to boil, and to be rai&s;ed
about a foot above the &s;urface: It was whiti&s;h,
and the top of it appeared like black &s;moke:
It made a kind of whi&s;pering noi&s;e, like a tor|rent
ru&s;hing down with violence into a deep
valley. This noi&s;e was mingled with another
that re&s;embled the hi&s;&s;ing of &s;erpents. A little
afterwards, we &s;aw an ob&s;cure canal or pipe,
which re&s;embled &s;moke ri&s;ing to the clouds,
and revolved with con&s;iderable velocity: This
pipe was about the &s;ize of a man's finger; and
the &s;ame noi&s;e continued. It then vani&s;hed,
having continued in all about a quarter of an
hour. We then perceived another on the
&s;outh, which began in the &s;ame manner as the
former: Immediately a third &s;prung up to the
we&s;t, and then a fourth likewi&s;e to the we&s;t;
the mo&s;t di&s;tant not exceeding a mu&s;ket-&s;hot
from us. Each of them appeared like heaps
of &s;moking &s;traw, and were accompanied
with the &s;ame noi&s;e as the fir&s;t. We next per|ceived
three pipes, or canals, extending from
the water to the clouds, where each of them
terminated like the mouth of a funnel or
trumpet, or like the paps of an animal drawn
perpendicularly downward by a weight. The&s;e
<PB N="401" REF="436">
pipes were of a dark white colour, which I
imagined to be owing to the water they con|tained;
for the pipes appeared to be formed
before they were filled with the water, and
they di&s;appeared when they were empty; in
the &s;ame manner as a cylinder of clear gla&s;s,
when held up in the light at a di&s;tance from
the eye, is not vi&s;ible, unle&s;s it be filled with
&s;ome coloured liquor. The&s;e pipes were not
&s;traight, but bent in &s;ome places: They were
not even perpendicular; on the contrary, from
the clouds into which they were ingrafted, to
the places from which they extracted the wa|ter,
they were very much inclined. And,
what is &s;ingular, the cloud to which the &s;econd
of the three was attached, having been pu&s;hed
forward by the wind, the pipe followed it
without breaking, or quitting its &s;tation in the
water; and, pa&s;&s;ing behind the pipe of the fir&s;t,
they remained for &s;ome time in the form of a
St Andrew's cro&s;s. At fir&s;t, none of the three
exceeded an inch in thickne&s;s, excepting where
they joined the cloud: But the one that ap|peared
fir&s;t, &s;welled afterwards con&s;iderably.
The other two continued not longer than the
one we had &s;een to the north. The &s;econd,
on the &s;outh, la&s;ted about a quarter of an
hour; but the fir&s;t, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the
ve&s;&s;el, continued longer, and gave us &s;ome un|ea&s;ine&s;s;
of it, therefore, we have &s;till farther
to remark, that, although it originally was not
<PB N="402" REF="437">
larger than a man's finger, it gradually &s;welled
to the &s;ize of an arm, then to that of a leg,
and, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> to that of the trunk of a tree as large
as a man could encompa&s;s with both his arms.
We &s;aw the water ri&s;ing di&s;tinctly through
this tran&s;parent body, which was of a &s;erpen|tine
form; and it &s;ometimes dimini&s;hed in
thickne&s;s both above and below. It now ex|actly
re&s;embled a &s;oft tube filled with water, and
pre&s;&s;ed with the fingers, either above to make
the fluid de&s;cend, or below to make it a&s;cend;
and I was &s;atisfied that the&s;e variations were
occa&s;ioned by the wind, which, when it pre&s;|&s;ed
the canal above, cau&s;ed the water to de|&s;cend,
and when the pre&s;&s;ure was lower down,
made the water a&s;cend. After this, it dimi|ni&s;hed
to the &s;ize of a man's arm; then it &s;wel|led
to the &s;ize of a thigh; then became ex|ceedingly
&s;mall; <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I perceived that the
water elevated from the &s;urface began to &s;ink,
and the end of the canal &s;eparated from it;
when a variation of the light removed it from
my view. I &s;till, however, continued to look
for it, becau&s;e I had remarked, that the canal
of the &s;econd &s;pout appeared to break in the
middle, and to reunite a little afterwards, one
half of it having been concealed by the light;
but this la&s;t never more appeared.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e &s;pouts are exceedingly dangerous at
&s;ea; for, when they fall upon a ve&s;&s;el, they
mingle &s;o with the &s;ails, that they &s;ometimes
<PB N="403" REF="438">
rai&s;e the ve&s;&s;el up, and let it fall back again
with &s;uch violence as to &s;ink it. But, although
they &s;hould not rai&s;e the &s;hip, they tear the
&s;ails, or let the whole water they contain fall
upon the ve&s;&s;el, which precipitates it to the
bottom. It is not improbable, that many ve&s;|&s;els,
of which we never have any accounts,
peri&s;h by &s;uch accidents; for there are few
examples of our ever learning with certainty
of &s;hips being lo&s;t in this manner.'</P>
<P>In the above account of water-&s;pouts, there
appears to be &s;everal optical illu&s;ions. But I
have related the facts <HI>verbatim,</HI> that they may
either be confirmed, or at lea&s;t compared with
tho&s;e of other navigators. M. Gentil, in his
voyage round the world, de&s;cribes water-&s;pouts
in the following manner: 'At eleven o'clock,
before noon, the &s;ky being cloudy, we &s;aw
round our &s;hip, at the di&s;tance of about a quar|ter
of a league, &s;ix water-&s;pouts, which began
with a noi&s;e like that of water running below
ground, and gradually increa&s;ed till it re&s;embled
the hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e occa&s;ioned by a high wind a|mong
the ropes of a &s;hip. We fir&s;t perceived
that the &s;ea began to boil; and its &s;urface ro&s;e
about a foot and a half; the top of this ele|vated
part was covered with a thick fog, or
rather &s;moke, which formed it&s;elf into a canal,
and mounted to the clouds. The&s;e canals
bended according as the wind carried the
clouds to which they were attached. Not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="404" REF="439">
the motion communicated to the
clouds by the wind, the canals not only ad|hered
to them, but &s;eemed to &s;tretch out, or
contract, in proportion as the clouds ro&s;e high|er,
or &s;unk down in the atmo&s;phere.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e appearances gave us much unea&s;ine&s;s;
and our &s;ailors, in&s;tead of encouraging each o|ther,
increa&s;ed their fears by dreadful &s;tories.
If the&s;e &s;pouts, &s;aid they, fall upon the &s;hip,
they will lift her up, and then plunge her to
the bottom. Others maintained, with a deci|&s;ive
tone, that they would not lift the ve&s;&s;el;
but that, being full of water, if the &s;hip went
forward, &s;he would break their communication
with the &s;ea, and that the great body of water,
by falling perpendicularly on the ve&s;&s;el, would
break her in pieces.'</P>
<P>'To prevent this misfortune, they lowered
the &s;ails, and charged the cannon. It is a ge|neral
opinion among &s;ailors, that the firing of
cannon, by agitating the air, bur&s;ts and di&s;per|&s;es
water-&s;pouts. But we were not under the
nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to this expedient;
for, after cour&s;ing round the &s;hip for about
ten minutes, &s;ome being about a quarter of a
league from us, and others nearer, the canals
became gradually narrower, detached them|&s;elves
from the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and then
entirely vani&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 191.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="440">
From the de&s;cription of the&s;e two voyagers,
it appears, that water-&s;pouts are produced, at
lea&s;t in part, by the action of fire or &s;moke,
which ri&s;es with violence from the bottom of
&s;ea; and that they are very different from tho&s;e
which are occa&s;ioned by oppo&s;ite winds: 'The
water-&s;pouts,' &s;ays Mr Shaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels. p. 334.</NOTE>, 'which I had
the opportunity of &s;eeing, &s;eemed to be &s;o ma|ny
cylinders of water falling down from the
clouds; though, by the reflection, it may be
of tho&s;e de&s;cending columns, or from the ac|tual
dropping of the water contained in them,
they would &s;ometimes appear, e&s;pecially at a
di&s;tance, to be &s;ucked up from the &s;ea. Nothing
more, perhaps, is required to explain this phae|nomenon,
than that the clouds &s;hould be fir&s;t
of all crouded together, and then, that contrary
winds, pre&s;&s;ing violently upon them, &s;hould
occa&s;ion them to conden&s;e, and fall in this cy|lindrical
manner.'</P>
<P>Many facts remain &s;till to be known before the&s;e
phaenomena can be properly explained. To me
it appears, that, if there be, in particular places,
at the bottom of the &s;ea, a mixture of &s;ulphur,
bitumen, and mineral &s;ub&s;tances, the&s;e may oc|ca&s;ionly
be inflamed, which will produce, like
the explo&s;ion of gun-powder, a great quantity
of air; and that this air newly generated, and
rarefied to a prodigious degree, mounts with ra|pidity,
and may elevate the water from the &s;ea
<PB N="406" REF="441">
to the clouds. In the &s;ame manner, if a perpen|dicular
current of air be produced by the explo|&s;ion
of &s;ulphureous matter in a cloud, the whole
of its water may follow this current, and give
ri&s;e to a water-&s;pout from the clouds to the &s;ea.
But, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that this account
of the la&s;t &s;pecies of &s;pout is not more &s;atisfac|tory
than that which we have given of tho&s;e
produced by contrary winds; for, it may be a&s;k|ed,
why tho&s;e &s;pouts which originate from the
clouds, are not as common on land as upon the
&s;ea?</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian of the academy for the year
1727, mentions a land water-&s;pout which ap|peared
at Cape&s;tan near Beziers. It de&s;cended
from a cloud like a black pillar, which gradually
dimini&s;hed, and ended in a point upon the &s;ur|face
of the earth. It followed the direction of
the wind, which was we&s;terly; it was attended
with a thick &s;moke, and made a noi&s;e like the
&s;ea when greatly agitated. It tore up trees by
the roots, and marked its way on the earth by
a large tract in which three carriages might have
pa&s;&s;ed each other. Another pillar of the &s;ame
kind appeared, but it &s;oon joined the fir&s;t; and,
when the whole was di&s;&s;ipated, there fell a great
quantity of hail.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of water-&s;pouts appears to be dif|ferent
from the other two. It is not &s;aid to have
contained water; and it &s;eems, both from what
I have mentioned, and by M. Andoque's expli|cation
<PB N="407" REF="442">
of it to the academy, to have been only
a hurricane rendered vi&s;ible by the du&s;t and con|den&s;ed
vapour which it contained. The &s;ame
hi&s;torian, for the year 1741, mentions a water-&s;pout
which was &s;een upon the lake of Geneva.
It was of a cylindrical figure, the upper part of
which ended in a black cloud, and the under
part of it was narrow, and terminated near the
&s;urface of the water. This meteor continued
only a few minutes; and, at the moment of its
di&s;&s;ipation, a thick vapour a&s;cended from the place
where it fir&s;t appeared; the water of the lake
boiled, and &s;eemed to make an effort to ri&s;e in|to
the air, which was very calm the whole time;
neither was this &s;pout followed either by wind
or rain. 'After all our knowledge of water-&s;pouts,'
&s;ays the hi&s;torian, 'does not this prove
that they are not produced by the conflict of
oppo&s;ite winds alone, but that they almo&s;t al|ways
originate from volcano's or &s;ubterrane|ous
vapours, which are known to exi&s;t at the
bottom of the &s;ea, as well as upon land? Whirl|winds
and hurricanes, therefore, which are ge|nerally
believed to be the cau&s;e of the&s;e appear|ances,
may be only an effect or an accidental
con&s;equence of them.'</P>

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Volcano's and Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>THE bowels of tho&s;e burning mountains
called <HI>volcano's,</HI> contain &s;ulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable materials, the effects of
which are more violent than tho&s;e of thunder
or of gun-powder; and they have, in all ages,
a&s;toni&s;hed mankind, and de&s;olated the earth. A
volcano is an immen&s;e cannon, with an aperture
often more than half a league in circumference.
From this va&s;t mouth are projected torrents of
&s;moke and of flames, rivers of bitumen, of &s;ul|phur,
and of melted metals, clouds of a&s;hes and
&s;tones; and &s;ometimes it ejects, to the di&s;tance
of &s;everal leagues, rocks &s;o enormous, that they
could not be moved by any combination of hu|man
<PB N="409" REF="444">
man powers. The conflagration is &s;o dreadful,
and the quantities of burning, calcined, melted,
and vitrified &s;ub&s;tances thrown out by the moun|tain
are &s;o great, that they bury whole towns
and fore&s;ts, cover the plains to the thickne&s;s
of a hundred or two hundred feet, and &s;ome|times
from hills and mountains, which are only
portions of the&s;e matters heaped up and com|pacted
into one ma&s;s. The action of the fire and
the force of the explo&s;ions are &s;o violent, that
they produce, by reaction, &s;uccu&s;&s;ions, which
&s;hake the earth, agitate the &s;ea, overturn moun|tains,
and de&s;troy towns and buildings of the
mo&s;t &s;olid materials.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects, though natural, have been re|garded
as prodigies; and, though we often be|hold,
in miniature, effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e of vol|cano's;
yet grandeur, from whatever &s;ource it
proceeds, has &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing influence up|on
the imagination, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing they
&s;hould have been con&s;idered by &s;ome authors as
vents to a central fire, and, by the vulgar, as
mouths of hell. A&s;toni&s;hment produces fear,
and fear is the &s;ource of &s;uper&s;tition. The in|habitants
of Iceland firmly believe that the groan|ings
of their volcano are the cries of the damned,
and that its eruptions are occa&s;ioned by the de|&s;peration
and ungovernable fury of devils and
tormented &s;pirits.</P>
<P>All the&s;e phaenomena, however, are only the
effects of fire and of &s;moke. In the bowels of
<PB N="410" REF="445">
mountains, there are veins of &s;ulphur, bitumen,
and other inflammable &s;ub&s;tances, together with
va&s;t quantities of pyrites, which ferment when
expo&s;ed to the air, or to moi&s;ture, and produce
explo&s;ions proportioned to the quantity of in|flammable
matter. This is the true idea of a
volcano; and it is ea&s;y for the naturali&s;t to imi|tate
the operation of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous fires.
A mixture of &s;ulphur, of filings of iron, and of
water, buried at a certain depth below the
ground, will exhibit, in miniature, all the ap|pearances
of a volcano: This mixture &s;oon fer|ments
to a degree of inflammation, throws off
the earth and &s;tones which cover it, and produces
explo&s;ions every way &s;imilar to tho&s;e of burn|ing
mountains.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t famous volcano's in Europe are
tho&s;e of Mount Aetna in Sicily, of Mount Hecla
in Iceland, and of Mount Ve&s;uvius, near Naples
in Italy. The burning of Mount Aetna is more
antient than the records of hi&s;tory. Its erup|tions
are extremely violent; and the quantity
of matter it throws out is &s;o enormous, that, af|ter
digging 68 feet deep, marble pavements, and
other ve&s;tiges of an antient city, have been
found covered with this amazing load of earth,
in the &s;ame manner as the town of Herculane|um
has been buried with the matter ejected
from Mount Ve&s;uvius. New mouths, or cra|ters,
were opened in Aetna, in the years 1650,
1669, and at other times. The &s;moke and
<PB N="411" REF="446">
flames of this volcano are &s;een as far as Malta,
a di&s;tance of 60 leagues: It &s;ends forth a perpe|tual
&s;moke, and, at particular times, it throws
out, with an a&s;toni&s;hing violence, flames, lava,
huge &s;tones, and matter of every kind. An e|ruption
of this volcano, in the year 1537, pro|duced
an earthquake over the whole i&s;land of
Sicily, which la&s;ted 12 days, and overthrew an
immen&s;e number of hou&s;es and public buildings.
It terminated by the bur&s;ting of a new mouth,
the lava of which burnt up every thing within
five leagues of the mountain. It di&s;charged
a&s;hes &s;o abundantly, and with &s;uch force, that
they reached the coa&s;t of Italy, and incommoded
ve&s;&s;els at great di&s;tances from the i&s;land. This
volcano has, at pre&s;ent, two principal craters,
one of which is narrower than the other. They
both &s;moke perpetually; but flames only appear
during the time of eruptions. Large &s;tones, it is
&s;aid, have been projected from them to the di|&s;tance
of 60,000 paces.</P>
<P>A violent eruption, in 1683, produced a
dreadful earthquake in Sicily. It laid the whole
city of Catanea in ruins, and killed more than
60,000 of its inhabitants, be&s;ide tho&s;e who
peri&s;hed in the neighbouring towns and villages.</P>
<P>Hecla darts its fires through the &s;nows and
ice of a frozen climate. Its eruption, how|ever,
are equally violent with tho&s;e of Aetna,
and other volcano's in the more &s;outhern regions.
It throws out a&s;hes, lava, pumice-&s;tones, and
<PB N="412" REF="447">
&s;ometimes boiling water. The whole i&s;land of
Iceland abounds in &s;ulphur; but it is not habi|table
within le&s;s than &s;ix leagues of the volcano.
The hi&s;tory of its mo&s;t violent eruptions is re|corded
in a book written by <HI>Dithmar Bleffken.</HI></P>
<P>According to hi&s;torians, the burning of mount
Ve&s;uvius began not before the &s;eventh con&s;ulate
of Titus Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and Flavius Domitian. The
top of the mountain then opened, and at fir&s;t
threw out &s;tones and rocks; the&s;e were &s;uc|ceeded
by flames and lava, which burned up
two neighbouring cities, and volumes of &s;moke
&s;o thick as to darken the light of the &s;un. The
elder Pliny, &s;timulated by curio&s;ity, approached
too near the mountain, and was &s;uffocated by
its &s;ulphureous &s;teams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pliny the younger's letter to Tacitus.</NOTE>. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius relates,
that this eruption was &s;o violent, that a&s;hes and
&s;ulphureous &s;teams were tran&s;mitted as far as
Rome, and acro&s;s the Mediterranean into Africa
and Egypt. Heraclea was one of the cities that
were overwhelmed by the matter ejected from
the mountain: It has lately been di&s;covered 60
feet under the &s;urface of the ground, which, in
the cour&s;e of time, had become arable, and fit
for every kind of culture. The hi&s;tory of the
di&s;covery of Heraclea is in the hands of the pu|blic.
We have only to wi&s;h, that &s;ome per&s;on,
&s;killed in the knowledge of nature, would exa|mine
with attention the different materials which
compo&s;e this 60 feet of earth, and remark their
<PB N="413" REF="448">
&s;ituation, the alterations they have undergone,
the direction they have followed, the hardne&s;s
they have acquired, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Naples appears to be &s;ituated upon a vault
filled with burning minerals; for Ve&s;uvius and
Solfatara &s;eem to have &s;ubterraneous communi|cations.
When Ve&s;uvius throws out lava, Sol|fatara
emits flames; and, when the eruptions of
the former cea&s;e, the burning of the latter is
likewi&s;e extingui&s;hed. The city of Naples is
nearly in the centre between them.</P>
<P>One of the la&s;t, and mo&s;t dreadful, eruptions
of Ve&s;uvius, happened in the year 1737<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This volume was publi&s;hed in the year 1749. Several eruptions have happened &s;ince that time. See Hamilton's hi&s;tory of ve&s;uvins.</NOTE>. The
mountain di&s;charged, from &s;everal mouths, im|men&s;e
torrents of melted matter, which &s;pread
over the fields, and terminated in the &s;ea. M.
de Montealegre, who communicated this account
of it to the Academy of Sciences, ob&s;erved, with
horror, one of the&s;e rivers of fire, which, from
its &s;ource to the &s;ea, was about 7 miles in length,
50 or 60 paces broad, from 25 to 30 palms
deep, and in the vallies 120 palms. The running
matter re&s;embled foam, or the dro&s;s which i&s;&s;ues
from a furnace, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See l'hi&s;t. de l'Acad. ann&eacute;e, 1737, p. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>In A&s;ia, and particularly in the i&s;lands of the
Indian ocean, volcano's are numerous. One of
the mo&s;t famous is Mount Albours, near Mount
Taurus, about 8 leagues from Herat. The top
<PB N="414" REF="449">
of this mountain &s;ends forth a pepetual &s;moke;
and it frequently throws out flames and burning
matter, in &s;uch quantities as to cover all the ad|jacent
plains with a&s;hes. In the i&s;land of Ter|nate,
there is a volcano which di&s;charges matter
&s;imilar to pumice-&s;tones. Some voyagers al|ledge,
that this volcano is mo&s;t furious during
the equinoxes, becau&s;e the&s;e periods are attended
with certain winds which increa&s;e the inflam|mation
of the&s;e fires, that have continued to
burn for ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyages d'Argen&s;ola, tom. 1. p. 21.</NOTE>. The i&s;land of Ternate is not
above 7 leagues round, and is only the top of a
large mountain. The land ri&s;es from the coa&s;t
to the middle of the i&s;land, where the volcano
mounts to a height &s;o great, that it is difficult to
get to the top of it. Several rills of &s;weet wa|ter
de&s;cend from the &s;ides of the mountain; and,
when the air is calm, and the weather fine, this
burning gulf is le&s;s agitated than during &s;torms
and high winds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Schouten.</NOTE>. This confirms what I for|merly
remarked, and &s;eems to prove, that the
fire of volcano's proceeds not from a great
depth, but from the top, or higher parts of the
mountain; for, if it were otherwi&s;e, high winds
could not increa&s;e the violence of the flames.
There are other volcano's in the Molucca i&s;lands.
In one of the i&s;lands of Mauritius, about 70
leagues from the Moluccas, there is a volcano,
the effects of which are equally violent as tho&s;e
<PB N="415" REF="450">
of the mountain in Ternate. The i&s;land of
Sorca, one of the Moluccas, was formerly inha|bited.
In the middle of this i&s;land there is a
very high mountain, with a volcano at the top
of it. In 1693, this volcano di&s;charged in im|men&s;e
quantity of bitumen, and inflamed mat|ter,
which, forming a burning lake, gradually
extended till it covered the whole i&s;land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. abrid. vol. 2. p. 391.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal volcano's in Japan, and the
adjacent i&s;lands, which &s;end out flames in the
night, and &s;moke in the day. In the Philippine
i&s;lands there are likewi&s;e &s;everal burning moun|tains.
One of the mo&s;t remarkable, and, at the
&s;ame time, the mo&s;t recent volcano in the Indian
i&s;lands, is that near the town of Panarucan in the
i&s;land of Java. It commenced in the year 1586;
and, at the fir&s;t eruption, it threw out immen&s;e
quantities of &s;ulphur, bitumen, and &s;tones. The
&s;ame year, Mount Gounapi, in the i&s;land of
Banda, which had been a volcano only about
17 years, opened and ejected, with a dreadful
noi&s;e, rocks and matter of every kind. There
are &s;till other volcano's in India, as in Sumatra,
and in the north of A&s;ia, beyond the river Je|ni&s;cea,
and the river Pe&s;ida: But the two la&s;t
are little known.</P>
<P>Near Fez in Africa, there is a mountain, or
rather a cavern, called <HI>Beni-guazeval,</HI> which
con&s;tantly throws out &s;moke, and &s;ometimes
flame. One of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, called
<PB N="416" REF="451">
the i&s;land of <HI>Fuogo,</HI> is nothing but a huge
mountain which burns ince&s;&s;antly. This vol|cano
ca&s;ts out &s;tones and a&s;hes; and the Portu|gueze,
who often attempted to inhabit the i&s;land,
have always abandoned the project, on account
of the volcano. The Peak of Teneriff, which
is reckoned one of the highe&s;t mountains in the
world, throws out fire, a&s;hes, and large &s;tones.
From the top of it, rivulets of melted &s;ulphur
run down the &s;outh &s;ide acro&s;s the &s;nows; this
&s;ulphur &s;oon conden&s;es and forms veins in the
&s;now, which are di&s;tingui&s;hable at great di|&s;tances.</P>
<P>America, and particularly the mountains of
Mexico and Peru, are much infe&s;ted with vol|cano's:
That of Arequipa is one of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated:
It often produces great earthquakes,
which are more frequent in Peru than in any
country of the world. Next to Arequipa, the
volcano's of Carrapa and Malahallo are, accor|ding
to the relation of travellers, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable.
But there are many others in the
new world of which we have no knowledge.
M. Bouguer, in his voyage to Peru, publi&s;hed in
the Memoirs of the Academy for the year 1744,
mentions two volcano's, the one called <HI>Cotopaxi,</HI>
and the other <HI>Pichincha.</HI> The fir&s;t is at &s;ome
di&s;tance from, and the other very near, the town
of Quito. In the year 1742, he &s;aw an erup|tion
of Cotopaxi, which, at that time, bur&s;t
open a new mouth in the mountain. It did no
<PB N="417" REF="452">
other damage than that of melting the &s;now,
and producing &s;uch torrents, as, in three hours,
laid the whole country, to the extent of 18
leagues, under water, and overturned every thing
that came in their way.</P>
<P>Popochampeche and Popocatepec are the
chief volcano's in Mexico. It was near this la&s;t
that Cortes pa&s;&s;ed in his way to the city of
Mexico: Some of the Spaniards a&s;cended to the
top of the mountain, where they found the cra|ter
to be about half a league in circumference.
Sulphureous mountains have al&s;o been found in
Guadaloupe, Tercera, and in others of the A|zore
i&s;lands; and, if all the mountains from
which &s;moke or flames i&s;&s;ue were to be con&s;i|dered
as volcano's, their number would exceed

A late earthquake at Lima was attended with
the mo&s;t dreadful effects. The town of Lima,
and the port of Callao, were almo&s;t entirely
&s;wallowed up. But the mi&s;chief was &s;till more
terrible at Callao. The &s;ea ro&s;e and covered
every hou&s;e in that unfortunate town, and drown|ed
the whole inhabitants, leaving only a &s;ingle
tour as a monument of its deva&s;tations. Of 25
ve&s;&s;els that lay in the harbour, four were driven
a league upon land, and the re&s;t &s;wallowed up
by the waves. Of Lima, which was a very large
city, only 27 hou&s;es remained &s;tanding. Mul|titudes
of people peri&s;hed; and the di&s;a&s;ter was
particularly fatal to the monks and other reli|gious,
becau&s;e their buildings were lofty, and of
more &s;olid materials than the common hou&s;es.
This calamity happened in the month of Octo|ber

<P>Gentil, in his voyage round the world, has
the following remarks upon earthquakes: '1.
That, half an hour before the earth begins to
&s;hake, all animals appear to be &s;eized with a
panic. The hor&s;es neigh, break their halters,
and run out of the &s;table; the dogs bark; the
birds, as if &s;tupid, fly for &s;helter into the
hou&s;es; the rats and mice come out of their
holes, &amp;c. 2. That &s;hips at anchor are &s;o
violently agitated, that all the parts of which
they are compo&s;ed &s;eem to be torn a&s;under;
their guns break loo&s;e, and their ma&s;ts &s;pring:
The&s;e facts I &s;hould hardly have credited, if
<PB N="428" REF="463">
they had not been confirmed to me by the
unanimous te&s;timony of many witne&s;&s;es. I
know that the bottom of the &s;ea is a continu|ation
of the land; and that agitations of the
one mu&s;t be communicated to the other; but
I could not comprehend how the different
parts of a ve&s;&s;el, &s;wimming in a fluid, &s;hould
be affected in the &s;ame manner as if &s;he had
been re&s;ting on the ground. Her motion, I
imagined, &s;hould have only re&s;embled that
produced by a &s;torm; be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent
in&s;tance, the &s;urface of the &s;ea was &s;mooth,
and the whole agitation mu&s;t have proceeded
from &s;ome internal cau&s;e, becau&s;e, at the time
of the earthquake, there was no wind. 3.
That, if the cavern of the earth which con|tains
the &s;ubterranean fire, runs from north to
&s;outh, and if the buildings of a town above it
lie in the &s;ame direction, the whole hou&s;es are
overturned; but, if the vein or cavern runs
acro&s;s the town, the damage produced by the
earthquake is le&s;s con&s;iderable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de M. le Gentil, tom. 1. p. 172.</NOTE>.'</P>

&s;ubject to earthquakes, they almo&s;t entirely cea&s;e,

<P>The enormous ravages produced by earth|quakes
have induced &s;ome naturali&s;ts to imagine,
<PB N="429" REF="464">
that mountains, and all the other irregularities
on the &s;urface of the globe, have derived their
origin from &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth occa&s;ioned by
the action of &s;ubterraneous fires. This, for in|&s;tance,
is the opinion of Mr Ray. He believes
that all the mountains have been formed by
earthquakes, or by the explo&s;ions of volcano's,
in the &s;ame manner as Monti di Cinere in Italy,
the new i&s;land near Santorini, &amp;c. But he has
not con&s;idered, that the &s;mall elevations formed
by earthquakes, or by the eruptions of volcano's,
are not, like all other mountains, compo&s;ed of
horizontal &s;trata; for, by digging into the Mon|ti
di Cinere, we find calcined &s;tones, a&s;hes, burnt
earth, iron-dro&s;s, pumice-&s;tones, all blended
together like a heap of rubbi&s;h. Be&s;ide, if earth|quakes
and &s;ubterraneous fires had rai&s;ed the
great mountains of the earth, as the Cordeliers,
Mount Taurus, the Alps, &amp;c. the prodigious
force requi&s;ite to elevate the&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es
would, at the &s;ame time, have de&s;troyed a great
part of the &s;urface of the globe. Earthquakes
&s;ufficient to produce &s;uch effects, mu&s;t have
been inconceivably violent, &s;ince the greate&s;t
of them recorded in hi&s;tory have not been able
to produce a &s;ingle mountain. In the reign of
Valentinian I. for in&s;tance, an earthquake was
felt over the whole known world<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ammian. Marcellin. lib. 26. c. 14.</NOTE>, and yet not
a mountain was rai&s;ed by it.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="465">
It is capable of demon&s;tration, however, that,
though an earthquake &s;hould have a force &s;uffi|cient
to rai&s;e the highe&s;t mountains, this force
would not be able to di&s;place the re&s;t of the
globe.</P>
<P>For, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the chain of high
mountains which traver&s;e South America from
the point of Terra Magellanica to New Grana|da
and the Gulf of Darien, had been &s;uddenly
elevated by an earthquake, and then let us e&s;ti|mate
the effect of this explo&s;ion. This chain of
mountains is about 1700 leagues long, and, at
a medium, 40 leagues broad, including the Si|erres,
which are lower than the Andes. This
gives a &s;urface of 68,000 &s;quare leagues. The
thickne&s;s of the matter di&s;placed by the earth|quake
I &s;uppo&s;e to be one league; or, that the
mean height of the mountains from their &s;ummits
to the caverns, which, agreeable to this hypo|the&s;is,
mu&s;t &s;upport them, is one league. The
force of the explo&s;ion, therefore, mu&s;t have ele|vated,
to the height of a league, a quantity of
earth equal to 68,000 cubic leagues. But, ac|tion
and reaction being equal, this explo&s;ion
mu&s;t have communicated an equal quantity of
motion to the whole globe. Now, the whole
globe con&s;i&s;ts of 12,310,523,801 cubic leagues.
From this number take 68,000, and there re|mains
12,310,455,801 cubic leagues, of which
the quantity of motion would be equal to that of
68,000 elevated one league. Hence it appears,
<PB N="431" REF="466">
that the force nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e 68,000 cubic
leagues would not be &s;ufficient to di&s;place the
whole globe a &s;ingle inch.</P>
<P>There is no ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility, therefore,
in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the mountains have been
rai&s;ed by earthquakes, were it not evident, both
from their internal &s;tructure and their external
figure, that they have been formed by the ope|ration
of the waters of the ocean. Their inte|rior
parts are compo&s;ed of parallel &s;trata, inter|&s;per&s;ed
with &s;ea-&s;hells; and their external figure
con&s;i&s;ts of angles every where corre&s;ponding. Is
it credible that this uniform &s;tructure, and regu|lar
figure, could have been produced by &s;udden
and de&s;ultory &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth?</P>
<P>But, as this notion has been embraced by
&s;ome philo&s;ophers, and, as the nature and effects
of earthquakes are not well under&s;tood, I &s;hall
hazard a few ideas, which may perhaps throw
&s;ome light upon this intricate &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;urface of the earth has undergone many
changes. At con&s;iderable depths, we find holes,
caverns, &s;ubterraneous rivulets, and voids, which
&s;ometimes communicate with each other by
means of chinks and fi&s;&s;ures. There are two
&s;pecies of caverns: The fir&s;t are tho&s;e which
have been formed by volcano's and the action
of &s;ubterraneous fires. The action of &s;ubterra|neous
fire elevates, &s;hakes, and throws off to a
di&s;tance the &s;uperincumbent materials; at the
&s;ame time, it &s;plits and deranges tho&s;e on each
<PB N="432" REF="467">
&s;ide of it, and thus produces caverns, grottos,
and irregular hollows. But &s;uch effects are on|ly
exhibited in the neighbourhood of volcano's,
and are not &s;o frequent as the other &s;pecies of
caverns which are produced by the operation of
water. It has already been remarked, that the
different &s;trata of the earth are all interrupted by
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, the origin of which &s;hall
be afterwards explained. The waters that fall
upon the &s;urface de&s;cend through tho&s;e fi&s;&s;ures,
collect when their progre&s;s is prevented by a
&s;tratum of clay, and form &s;prings and rivulets.
From the nature of water, it &s;earches for cavities
or &s;mall vacuities, and has a con&s;tant tendency
to force a pa&s;&s;age, till it finds a proper vent.
Wherever it goes, it carries along with it &s;and,
gravel, and other bodies, which it is capable of
dividing or di&s;&s;olving. In this manner, the o|peration
of water proceeds till it forms &s;ubter|raneous
pa&s;&s;ages; and then it breaks out in the
form of fountains, either on the &s;urface of the
earth, or in the bottom of the &s;ea. The mate|rials
which it perpetually carries off leave hol|lows
or caverns in the bowels of the earth,
which are often of great extent; and the&s;e ca|verns
have a very different origin from tho&s;e
produced by volcano's or earthquakes.</P>
<P>Earthquakes are of two kinds: The one is
occa&s;ioned by the action of &s;ubterraneous fires,
and by the explo&s;ions of volcano's, and are only
felt at &s;mall di&s;tances, previous to, or during the
<PB N="433" REF="468">
time of eruptions. When the inflammable mat|ters
in the bowels of the earth begin to ferment
and to burn, the fire makes an effort to e&s;cape
in every direction; and, if it finds no natural
vents, it forces a pa&s;&s;age, by elevating and throw|ing
off the earth above it. In this manner vol|cano's
commence, and their effects continue in
proportion to the quantity of inflammable mat|ter
they contain. When the quantity of in|flamed
matter is incon&s;iderable, it produces only
an earthquake, and exhibits no marks of a vol|cano:
The air generated by &s;ubterraneous fire
may al&s;o e&s;cape through &s;mall fi&s;&s;ures; and, in
this ca&s;e, likewi&s;e, it will be attended with a &s;uc|cu&s;&s;ion
of the earth; but no volcano will appear.
But, when the quantity of inflamed matter is
great, and when it is confined on all &s;ides by &s;o|lid
and compact bodies, an earthquake and a
volcano are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. But all
the&s;e commotions con&s;titute only the fir&s;t &s;pecies
of earthquakes, which are not felt but in the
neighbourhood of the places where they hap|pen.
A violent eruption of Aetna, for example,
will &s;hake all the i&s;land of Sicily; but it will
never extend to the di&s;tance of three or four
hundred leagues. When Ve&s;uvius bur&s;ts open
a new mouth, it excites an earthquake in Naples
and in the neighbourhood of the volcano; but
the&s;e earthquakes never &s;hake the Alps; nor do
they extend to France or other countries di&s;tant
from Ve&s;uvius. Thus, earthquakes produced
<PB N="434" REF="469">
by volcano's are limited to a &s;mall &s;pace; they
are nothing but effects of the reaction of the fire,
and they &s;hake the earth in the &s;ame manner as
the explo&s;ion of a powder-magazine occa&s;ions
an agitation to the di&s;tance of &s;everal leagues.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;pecies of earthquakes,
which are very different in their effects, and per|haps
al&s;o in their cau&s;e. The&s;e earthquakes
are felt at great di&s;tances, and &s;hake a long tract
of ground, without the intervention either of a
new volcano, or of eruptions in tho&s;e that al|ready
exi&s;t. There are in&s;tances of earthquakes
which have been felt at the &s;ame time in Britain,
in France, in Germany, and in Hungary. The&s;e
earthquakes always extend more in length than
in breadth. They &s;hake a zone or belt of earth
with greater or le&s;s violence in different places;
and they are generally accompanied with a hol|low
noi&s;e, like that of a heavy carriage rolling
with rapidity.</P>
<P>As to the cau&s;es of this &s;pecies of earthquake,
it mu&s;t be remarked, that the explo&s;ion of all
inflammable &s;ub&s;tances, like that of gun-powder,
generates a great quantity of air; that this air
is highly rarified by the heat; and that its effects,
from the compre&s;&s;ion it receives by being con|&s;ined
in the bowels of the earth, mu&s;t be exceed|ingly
violent. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that, at the depth
of 100 or 200 fathoms, there are a va&s;t collec|tion
of pyrites and &s;ulphureous bodies, and that
they are inflamed by the fermentation pro|duced
<PB N="435" REF="470">
by the admi&s;&s;ion of water to them, or by
other cau&s;es. What mu&s;t be the effect? In the
fir&s;t place, tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are not placed in
horizontal beds, like the antient &s;trata, which
were formed by the &s;ediments of the waters;
they are lodged, on the contrary, in the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, in &s;ubterraneous caverns,
and other places, to which the water has ac|ce&s;s.
When inflamed, they generate a va&s;t
quantity of air, the &s;pring of which, by be|ing
compre&s;&s;ed in a &s;mall &s;pace, like that of a
cavern, will not &s;hake the earth immediately a|bove,
but it will &s;earch for pa&s;&s;ages in order to
expand and make its e&s;cape. Caverns, and the
channels of &s;ubterraneous rivulets and &s;prings,
are the only natural pa&s;&s;ages for this rarified air.
Into the&s;e, therefore, it will ru&s;h with impetuo|&s;ity,
and produce in them a furious wind, the
noi&s;e of which will be heard on the &s;urface; and
it will be attended with vibrations or &s;uccu&s;&s;ions
of the ground. This &s;ubterraneous wind pro|duced
by fire, will extend the whole length of
the caverns or channels, and occa&s;ion a &s;haking,
more or le&s;s violent, in proportion to its di&s;tance
from the heat, and to the width or narrowne&s;s
of the canals. But this motion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
run in a longitudinal direction; and the &s;haking,
of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be felt over a long belt of ground.
This air, however, cannot produce an eruption
or a volcano; becau&s;e it finds &s;ufficient room
for expanding it&s;elf, and dimini&s;hing its force;
or rather, becau&s;e it e&s;capes through fi&s;&s;ures in
<PB N="436" REF="471">
the form of vapour or of wind. But, although
the exi&s;tence of caverns or channels for the pa&s;|&s;age
of this rarified air &s;hould be denied, it is
ea&s;y to conceive, that, in the very place where
the explo&s;ion is made, as the earth is elevated to
a con&s;iderable height, the neighbouring places
mu&s;t &s;plit horizontally in attempting to yield to
the impul&s;e communicated by the original mo|tion;
and, in this manner, pa&s;&s;ages may be gra|dually
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively opened, &s;o as to commu|nicate
with very di&s;tant places. This explica|tion
corre&s;ponds with all the phaenomena. Earth|quakes
are not felt at great di&s;tances at the &s;ame
minute, or even the &s;ame hour. They are not
accompanied with eruptions or external fire;
and the noi&s;e almo&s;t con&s;tantly marks the pro|gre&s;&s;ive
motion of this &s;ubterraneous wind. O|ther
facts concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing this theory.
Bla&s;ts of wind, and vapours, &s;ometimes of a &s;uf|focating
nature, it is well known, ari&s;e from
mines, independent of the motion in the air pro|duced
by the current of water. It is equally
well known, that winds i&s;&s;ue from certain aper|tures
of the earth, from caverns, aby&s;&s;es, and
deep lakes, as lake Bole&s;law in Bohemia, which
we have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>When the&s;e remarks are con&s;idered, I cannot
comprehend how the mountains &s;hould have o|riginated
from earthquakes, &s;ince the mineral
and &s;ulphureous bodies which occa&s;ion them
are &s;eldom to be met with but in the perpendicu|lar
<PB N="437" REF="472">
fi&s;&s;ures of mountains, and in other cavities of
the earth, the greate&s;t number of which have
been produced by the operation of water; &s;ince
tho&s;e inflammable &s;ub&s;tances produce only a mo|mentary
explo&s;ion, and violent winds which fol|low
the channels of &s;ubterraneous waters; &s;ince
the duration of earthquakes on the &s;urface of the
earth is &s;o &s;hort, they mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by a
&s;udden explo&s;ion, and not by a continued con|flagration;
and, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> &s;ince tho&s;e earthquakes,
which extend over large tracts of ground, never
produce the &s;malle&s;t eminence throughout their
whole cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Earthquakes, it is true, are more frequent in
the neighbourhood of volcano's, as in Sicily, and
the environs of Ve&s;uvius: But it appears, from
repeated ob&s;ervation, that the&s;e earthquakes are
very limited, and, con&s;equently, can never form
a chain of mountains.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes been remarked, that the
matters ejected from Aetna, after cooling for &s;e|veral
years, and being afterwards moi&s;tened with
rain, have rekindled, and thrown out flames with
&s;uch violent explo&s;ions, as to occa&s;ion &s;mall
earthquakes.</P>
<P>In 1669, during a violent eruption of Etna,
which began on the 11th of March, the &s;ummit
of the mountain &s;unk con&s;iderably<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. abridg. vol. 2. p 387.</NOTE>; which is
a proof that this volcano proceeds rather from
the &s;uperior part of the mountain than from
the bottom of it. Borelli, who is of the &s;ame
<PB N="438" REF="473">
opinion, ob&s;erves, 'That the fire of a volcano
proceeds neither from the centre, nor from the
bottom of a mountain, but from the top; and
that the inflammation never kindles but at a
&s;mall depth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borelli de incendiis montis Aetnae.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Mount Ve&s;uvius has frequently thrown out,
during eruptions, great quantities of boiling wa|ter.
Mr Ray, who imagines that the fire of
volcano's comes from a very great depth, &s;ays,
that this water proceeds from the &s;ea, which com|municates,
by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, with the
foot of the mountain. As a proof, he mentions
the remarkable dryne&s;s of the top of Ve&s;uvius,
and the agitation of the &s;ea during eruptions,
which &s;ometimes recedes &s;o far as to leave the
port of Naples entirely dry. But, &s;uppo&s;ing
the&s;e facts to be true, they by no means prove
that the fire of volcano's proceeds from a great
depth; for the water they eject is certainly rain|water,
which penetrates through the fi&s;&s;ures, and
collects in the cavities of the mountain. Rills
and &s;prings i&s;&s;ue from the tops of volcano's as
well as from other high mountains; and, as the
former are hollow, and have &s;uffered more con|cu&s;&s;ions
than the latter, nothing can be more na|tural
than they &s;hould collect water in their ca|verns,
and that the&s;e waters &s;hould &s;ometimes
be ejected, along with other &s;ub&s;tances, in the
time of eruptions. With regard to the motion
of the &s;ea, it ari&s;es &s;olely from the &s;hock com|municated
<PB N="439" REF="474">
to the waters by the explo&s;ion, which
makes it advance or retire according to different
circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common &s;ub&s;tances thrown out by
volcano's, are torrents of melted minerals, which
overflow the environs of the mountain. The&s;e
rivers of lava extend to great di&s;tances; and, in
cooling, they form beds, either horizontal or in|clined,
in the &s;ame manner as the &s;trata accumu|lated
by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ediments from water; but
the former are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from the
latter: 1. Becau&s;e &s;trata of lava are not every
where equal in thickne&s;s. 2. Becau&s;e they con|tain
nothing that has not evidently been cal|cined,
vitrified, or melted. 3. Becau&s;e their
extent is more limited. As there is a va&s;t num|ber
of volcano's in Peru, and, as the bottoms of
mo&s;t of the Cordeliers are covered with &s;ub&s;tan|ces
that have been thrown out by eruptions, it
is not &s;urpri&s;ing that no &s;ea-&s;hells have been
found there; for they mu&s;t have been calcined
and de&s;troyed by the fire. But I am &s;till per|&s;uaded,
that, if the clay ground, which, accor|ding
to M. Bourguet, is the ordinary earth in the
valley of Quito, had been dug, &s;hells would have
been di&s;covered there, as well as every where
el&s;e, e&s;pecially where the ground is not covered,
like the bottoms of the mountains, with matters
ejected from volcano's.</P>
<P>It has often been a&s;ked, Why all volcano's
appear only on high mountains? I have partly
<PB N="440" REF="475">
&s;olved this que&s;tion in the preceding article.
But, before fini&s;hing the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I &s;hall
endeavour more fully to explain my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The peaks or points of mountains were ori|ginally
covered with earth and &s;and, which, af|ter
being gradually wa&s;hed down to the vallies
by the rains, left nothing but tho&s;e bare rocks
or &s;tones called the core of mountains, which,
being likewi&s;e &s;ubjected to the action of the
weather, &s;mall and large fragments of them mu&s;t
have been occa&s;ionally loo&s;ened, and, of cour&s;e,
mu&s;t have rolled down to the plains. The rocks
at the ba&s;e of the &s;ummit being fully uncovered,
and having lo&s;t their original &s;upport from the
&s;and and earth, would nece&s;&s;arily give way a
little, and, by &s;eparating from each other, would
produce &s;mall intervals. But this yielding of
the lower rocks could not take place without
rending tho&s;e that lay above them. In this man|ner
the core of the mountain, from the &s;ummit
to the ba&s;e of the lower rocks, would be &s;plit
into an infinite number of perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures
of different dimen&s;ions. Through the&s;e the rains
would penetrate and carry along with them, into
the bowels of the mountain, all the minerals, and
other &s;ub&s;tances which they were capable of
tran&s;porting or di&s;&s;olving. Here pyrites, &s;ul|phur,
and other combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, would be
produced; and, in the cour&s;e of time, the&s;e bo|dies
would accumulate in great quantities, and,
by their fermentation, would give ri&s;e to explo|&s;ions
<PB N="441" REF="476">
and other effects of volcano's. Heaps of
the&s;e mineral &s;ub&s;tances might likewi&s;e exi&s;t in
the heart of the mountain, before the rain could
penetrate &s;o deep. In this ca&s;e, as &s;oon as the
air or rain got acce&s;s to them by means of the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, a conflagration and vol|cano
would in&s;tantly take place. No &s;uch phae|nomena
can be exhibited in plains; for, as every
thing there is at re&s;t, and nothing can be di&s;|placed,
it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the exi&s;tence of
volcano's &s;hould be confined entirely to the
mountains.</P>
<P>When coal-mines are opened, which are com|monly
found in clay-grounds, and at a great
depth, the mineral &s;ub&s;tances above mentioned
&s;ometimes kindle into flames. There are ex|amples
in Scotland, Flanders, &amp;c. of coal-mines
which have continued to burn for many years.
The admi&s;&s;ion of air is alone &s;ufficient to pro|duce
this effect. But the&s;e inflammations occa|&s;ion
only &s;light explo&s;ions, and never form vol|cano's;
becau&s;e, in &s;uch places, all being plain
and &s;olid, the fire cannot be excited to &s;uch a
degree as in burning mountains, which are full
of caverns and cliffs, through which the air pe|netrates,
and augments the action of the fire &s;o
forcibly, as to give ri&s;e to the terrible effects we
have been de&s;cribing.</P>

<P>NEW i&s;lands are either produced &s;uddenly
by the operation of &s;ubterraneous fires,
or &s;lowly by the accumulated &s;ediments of wa|ter.
Upon this &s;ubject we are furni&s;hed with
indubitable facts, both by antient hi&s;torians, and
by modern voyagers. Seneca tells us, that, in
his time, the i&s;land of Thera&s;ia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now called Santorini.</NOTE> &s;uddenly emer|ged
from the &s;ea, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of many
&s;pectators. Pliny relates, that 13 i&s;lands former|ly
aro&s;e all at once from the bo&s;om of the Me|diterranean,
and that Rhodes and Delos are the
chief of them. According to Ammianus Mar|cellinus,
Philo, Pliny, &amp;c. the&s;e 13 i&s;lands were
<PB N="443" REF="478">
not formed by an earthquake or by a &s;ubterra|neous
explo&s;ion, but were formerly concealed
under the water, which &s;unk and uncovered
them. Delos was even di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of Pelagia, becau&s;e it formerly belonged
to the &s;ea. Whether the&s;e 13 new i&s;lands were
produced by the action of &s;ubterraneous fire, or
by any other cau&s;e which dimini&s;hed the quan|tity
of water in the Meditterranen, it is not ea|&s;y
to determine. But we are informed by Pli|ny
him&s;elf, that the i&s;land of Hiera, in the neigh|bourhood
of Thera&s;ia, is compo&s;ed of ferrugi|nous
ma&s;&s;es, and of earth which had been thrown
up from the bottom of the &s;ea; and, in another
place, he mentions &s;everal other i&s;lands which
had been formed in the &s;ame manner. Upon
this &s;ubject, however, we have facts more re|cent,
and le&s;s involved in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>On the 23d day of May 1707, at &s;un-ri&s;ing,
there appeared, at the di&s;tance of two or three
miles from the i&s;land of Thera&s;ia or Santorini,
&s;omething which had the re&s;emblance of a float|ing
rock. Some men, &s;timulated by curio&s;ity,
approached it, and di&s;covered that it had ari&s;en
from the bottom of the &s;ea; that it increa&s;ed
under their feet; that oi&s;ters and other &s;hells &s;till
adhered to the rocks; and that many pumice|&s;tones
lay on its &s;urface. Two days before this
rock appeared, there had been a &s;light earthquake
in Santorini. This i&s;land continued to augment
con&s;iderably, without any accident, till the 14th
<PB N="444" REF="479">
of June; it was then about half a mile in cir|cumference,
and 20 or 30 feet high, and the
earth was white, and mixed with clay. After
this, the &s;ea began to be more and more agita|ted;
vapours aro&s;e from it which infe&s;ted the
i&s;land of Santorini, and, on the 16th of July,
17 or 18 rocks ro&s;e all at once from the bottom
of the &s;ea, and united into one ma&s;s. The&s;e
phaenomena were attended with a frightful noi&s;e,
which continued two months; and flames i&s;&s;u|ed
from the new i&s;land, which &s;till augmented
both in circumference and height; and the ex|plo&s;ions
were &s;o violent, that they drove large
&s;tones to more than 7 miles di&s;tance. The i&s;land
of Santorini it&s;elf was regarded by the antients
as a recent production; and, in 726, 1427, and
1573, it received con&s;iderable additions, be&s;ide
the &s;mall i&s;lands formed in its neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'hi&s;t. de l'acad, des &s;ciences, 1708. p. 23.</NOTE>.
The &s;ame volcano, which, in the days of Seneca,
rai&s;ed the i&s;land of Santorini, produced, in Pli|ny's
time, that of Hiera or Volcanella, and, in
our days, the rock above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October 1720, a great fire
was &s;een to ari&s;e from the &s;ea near the i&s;land of
Tercera. Navigators being &s;ent, by order of go|vernment,
to examine it, they perceived, on the
19th of the &s;ame month, an i&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting
of fire and &s;moke; and a prodigious quantity of
a&s;hes, thrown to a great di&s;tance, as from a vol|cano,
accompanied with a noi&s;e &s;imilar to that
<PB N="445" REF="480">
of thunder. The earth was al&s;o perceived to
&s;hake in the neighbourhood; and a va&s;t number
of pumice-&s;tones were found floating on the
&s;ea all round the new i&s;land: This la&s;t phaeno|menon
has &s;ometimes been remarked in the o|pen
&s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See philo&s;ophical tran&s;act. abridg. vol. 6. part 2, p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian of the French academy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ann. 1721, p. 26.</NOTE>, in
narrating this event, remarks, that, after an
earthquake in the i&s;land of St Michael, one of
the Azores, there appeared a torrent of fire be|tween
this i&s;land and that of Tercera, which
gave ri&s;e to two new rocks: And, in the &s;ub|&s;equent
year, the &s;ame hi&s;torian gives the fol|lowing
detail:</P>
<P>'M. de l'I&s;le has informed the academy of
&s;everal particulars concerning the new i&s;land
among the Azores, which he received in a
letter from M. de Montagnac con&s;ul at Li&s;|bon.
On the 18th of September 1721, M. de
Montagnac's ve&s;&s;el was moored off the fortre&s;s
of St Michael; and he learned the following
particulars from the pilot of the port.'</P>
<P>'During the night of the 7th or 8th of De|cember
1720, there was a great earthquake in
Tercera and St Michael, which i&s;lands are di|&s;tant
from each other about 28 leagues, and a
new i&s;land ro&s;e from the &s;ea. It was, at the
&s;ame time, remarked, that the point of the
i&s;land of Peak, at the di&s;tance of 30 leagues,
<PB N="446" REF="481">
which formerly threw out flames, was extin|gui&s;hed.
But a continual thick &s;moke i&s;&s;ued from
the new i&s;land, which was di&s;tinctly perceived
by M. de Montagnac, as long as he continued
in that part. The pilot a&s;&s;ured him, that he
had &s;ailed round the i&s;land, and approached
it as near as he could with &s;afety. He &s;ound|ed
on the &s;outh &s;ide of it with a rope of 60
fathoms; but found no bottom. On the we&s;t
&s;ide, the water was much changed: It ap|peared
to be mixed with white, blue, and
green; and, at the di&s;tance of two miles, it
&s;eemed to be &s;hallow and boiling. On the
north-we&s;t, the &s;ide from which the &s;moke
i&s;&s;ued, he found, at 15 fathoms, a bottom of
coar&s;e &s;and. He threw a &s;tone into the &s;ea,
and, at the place where it fell, he ob&s;erved the
water boil, and mount into the air with great
impetuo&s;ity. The bottom was &s;o hot, that, at
two different times, it melted a piece of &s;uet
which had been fa&s;tened to the end of the
plumb-line. The pilot likewi&s;e remarked,
that &s;moke i&s;&s;ued from a &s;mall lake, in the
mid&s;t of a &s;andy plain. This i&s;land is nearly
round, and high enough to be perceived, in
clear weather, at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight
leagues.'</P>
<P>'We have &s;ince learned, by a letter from M.
Adrien, French con&s;ul at St Michael, dated
in March 1722 that the new i&s;land is con&s;i|derably
dimini&s;hed; that it is nearly on a
<PB N="447" REF="482">
level with the water; and that it will probably
&s;oon di&s;appear.'</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and many other facts of a &s;imilar
nature, it is apparent, that inflammable bodies
exi&s;t under the bottom of the &s;ea, and that they
&s;ometimes produce violent explo&s;ions. The
places where they happen may be con&s;idered as
&s;ubmarine volcano's, which differ from com|mon
volcano's only in the &s;horter duration of
their effects; for, after the fire opens a pa&s;&s;age
to it&s;elf, the water ru&s;hes in, and extingui&s;hes
them. The elevation of new i&s;lands nece&s;|&s;arily
leaves caverns, which are &s;oon filled by the
waters; and the new ground, which con&s;i&s;ts of
matter thrown out by the &s;ubmarine volcano,
mu&s;t, in every re&s;pect, re&s;emble that of the
Monte di Cinere, and other eminences which
have been rai&s;ed by terre&s;trial volcano's. It is
on account of the water's ru&s;hing into the voids
and fi&s;&s;ures produced by explo&s;ions, that &s;ub|marine
volcano's exhibit their effects le&s;s fre|quently
than common volcano's, though both
derive their origin from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;ubterraneous, or rather &s;ubmarine fires,
mu&s;t be a&s;cribed all tho&s;e ebullitions of the &s;ea,
and water-&s;pouts, which have been remarked in
different places by mariners: They al&s;o produce
&s;torms and earthquakes, the effects of which are
equally felt at &s;ea as upon land. The i&s;lands
rai&s;ed by &s;ubmarine volcano's are generally
compo&s;ed of pumice-&s;tones and calcined rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="483">
Fire has frequently been ob&s;erved to i&s;&s;ue out
of the waters of the &s;ea. Pliny tells us, that the
whole &s;urface of the Thra&s;ymen lake has ap|peared
to be inflamed; and Agricola informs us,
that, when a &s;tone was thrown into the lake of
Den&s;tat in Thuringia, its de&s;cent was marked by
a train of fire.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> the great quantities of pumice-&s;tones
di&s;covered by voyagers in different parts of the
ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean, demon|&s;trate
the exi&s;tence of volcano's in the bottom
of the &s;ea, which differ not from tho&s;e upon
land, either in the violence of their explo&s;ions,
or in the matter they throw out, but only in
their rarity, and in the &s;hortne&s;s of their dura|tion.
Hence it may be remarked, that the bot|tom
of the &s;ea every way re&s;embles the &s;urface
of the earth, not admitting even the exception
of volcano's.</P>
<P>Between &s;ea and land volcano's there are
many relations. Both of them exi&s;t on the
tops of mountains. The Azore i&s;lands, and
tho&s;e of the Archipelago, are only the points
of mountains, &s;ome of which are above, and
others under, the &s;urface of the water. From
the account of the new i&s;lands among the A|zores,
it appears, that the place where the &s;moke
i&s;&s;ued was only 15 fathoms deep, which, when
compared with the ordinary depth of the ocean,
demon&s;trates this place to be the top of a pretty
high mountain. The &s;ame remark may be
<PB N="449" REF="484">
made with regard to the new i&s;land near Santo|rini.
Its depth mu&s;t have been incon&s;iderable,
&s;ince oi&s;ters were found attached to the rocks
which ro&s;e above the &s;urface of the water. It
likewi&s;e appears, that &s;ea-volcano's, as well as
tho&s;e upon land, have &s;ubterraneous communi|cations;
for, at the very time that the new
i&s;land among the Azores aro&s;e, the &s;ummit of
the volcano of St George, in the i&s;land of Peak,
&s;unk. It al&s;o merits ob&s;ervation, that new
i&s;lands never appear but in the neighbourhood
of old ones; and that there are no examples of
new i&s;lands in open &s;eas: They ought, there|fore,
to be regarded as continuations of the an|tient
i&s;lands; and, when volcano's happen to
exi&s;t in the latter, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the for|mer
&s;hould contain the &s;ame materials, which
may be kindled either by fermentation alone,
or by the action of &s;ubterraneous winds.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, new i&s;lands produced by earthquakes,
or by &s;ubterraneous fires, are few in number.
But the number of tho&s;e formed by &s;lime, &s;and,
and earth, tran&s;ported by rivers, or by the mo|tions
of the &s;ea, is almo&s;t infinite. At the
mouths of rivers, &s;uch quantities of earth and
&s;and are ama&s;&s;ed, as frequently give ri&s;e to
i&s;lands of con&s;iderable extent. The &s;ea, by re|tiring
from certain coa&s;ts, leaves uncovered the
highe&s;t parts of the bottom, and the&s;e parts con|&s;titute
&s;o many new i&s;lands. In the &s;ame man|ner,
when the &s;ea encroaches upon the land, it
<PB N="450" REF="485">
covers the plains, and the more elevated grounds
appear in the form of i&s;lands. It is for this rea|&s;on
that there are few i&s;lands in the open &s;eas,
and that they are &s;o numerous near the coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>Fire and water, though of very oppo&s;ite na|tures,
exhibit many effects &s;o &s;imilar, that the
one may often be mi&s;taken for the other. Be|&s;ide
the productions peculiar to the&s;e elements,
as chry&s;tal, gla&s;s, &amp;c. they give ri&s;e to many
great phaenomena, which have &s;uch &s;trong re|&s;emblances,
that they can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed.
Water, as we have &s;een, elevates moun|tains,
and forms the greate&s;t number of i&s;lands:
Some mountains and i&s;lands likewi&s;e derive their
origin from fire. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies
to caverns, fi&s;&s;ures, gulfs, &amp;c. Some of them
are the effects of fire, and others of water.</P>
<P>Caverns are, in a great mea&s;ure, peculiar to
mountains: They are &s;eldom or never found in
plains. They are frequent in the Archipelago,
and other i&s;lands; becau&s;e i&s;lands are generally
nothing but the tops of mountains. Caverns,
like precipices, are formed by the &s;inking or
mouldering of rocks, or, like aby&s;&s;es, by the
action of fire; for, to make a cavern form a
precipice or an aby&s;s, nothing farther is nece&s;|&s;ary
than that the tops of the oppo&s;ite rocks
&s;hould come together and form an arch, which
mu&s;t frequently happen when they are loo&s;ened
at the root, and &s;haken by earthquakes, or by
the operation of time and of the weather. Ca|verns
<PB N="451" REF="486">
may be produced by the &s;ame cau&s;es which
give ri&s;e to gulfs, apertures, or &s;inkings of the
earth; and the&s;e cau&s;es are explo&s;ions of vol|cano's,
the action of &s;ubterraneous vapours, and
earthquakes, which create &s;uch commotions in
the earth as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce caverns,
fi&s;&s;ures, and hollows of every kind.</P>
<P>The cavern of St Patrick in Ireland is not &s;o
con&s;iderable as it is famous: The &s;ame remark
may be made with regard to the Grotto del Cane
in Italy, and to that of Mount Beni-guazeval, in
the kingdom of Fez, which throws out fire.
There is a very large cavern in the county of
Derby in England. It is much larger than the
celebrated cavern of Bauman, near the Black
Fore&s;t of Brun&s;wick. I was informed by the
Earl of Morton, a philo&s;opher more re&s;pectable
for his merit than his high rank, that the en|trance
to this cavern, called the <HI>Devil's hole,</HI>
is larger than the door of any church; that a
&s;mall river runs through it; that, after advan|cing
&s;ome way, the vault of the cavern &s;inks
down &s;o low, that, in order to proceed farther,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to lie flat in a boat, and to be
pu&s;hed through this narrow pa&s;&s;age by people
accu&s;tomed to the bu&s;ine&s;s; and that, after get|ting
through, the roof, or arch of the cavern,
ri&s;es to a great height; and, after walking a con|&s;iderable
way on the &s;ide of the river, the arch
&s;inks again &s;o low as to touch the &s;urface of the
water. Here the cavern terminates. The river,
<PB N="452" REF="487">
which &s;eems to have its &s;ource in this part of
the cavern, &s;wells occa&s;ionally, and tran&s;ports
heaps of &s;and, which, by accumulating, forms a
kind of blind alley, who&s;e direction is different
from that of the principal cavern.</P>
<P>In Carniola, near Potpechio, there is a large
cavern, in which is a pretty con&s;iderable lake.
Near Adel&s;perg, we meet with a cavern in which
a man may travel two German miles. It contains
&s;everal tremendous and deep precipices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Acta erud. Lip&s;. anno 1689, p. 558.</NOTE>. The
Mendip hills in Somer&s;et-&s;hire likewi&s;e pre&s;ent us
with exten&s;ive caverns, and very fine grottos.
Near the&s;e caverns we find veins of lead, and
&s;ometimes large oak-trees, buried 15 fathoms
deep. In the county of Glouce&s;ter, there is a
large cavern called <HI>Pen-park-hole,</HI> at the bottom
of which we meet with 32 fathoms of water.
Here we al&s;o find veins of lead.</P>
<P>It is apparent, that the Devil's-hole, and o|ther
caverns, from which i&s;&s;ue large &s;prings or
brooks, have been gradually formed by the ope|ration
of the water, and their origin cannot be
a&s;cribed to earthquakes or volcano's.</P>
<P>One of the large&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ingular caverns
we are acquainted with, is that of Antiparos, of
which M. Tournefort has given a complete de|&s;cription.
We fir&s;t find a ru&s;tic cave about 30
feet wide, divided by &s;ome natural pillars. Be|tween
two pillars on the right, the ground &s;lops
gently, and then more precipitately for about
<PB N="453" REF="488">
20 paces to the bottom of the cavern. This is
the pa&s;&s;age to the grotto or interior cave, and is
nothing but a dark hole, through which a man
cannot pa&s;s without &s;tooping, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of lights. We then de&s;cend, by means of a
rope fixed at the entrance, a horrible precipice,
and arrive on the very borders of another &s;till
more tremendous, with corre&s;ponding aby&s;&s;es on
the left. By a ladder placed on the margin of
the&s;e gulphs, we get over a va&s;t perpendicular
rock. We then continue to &s;lip through places
le&s;s dangerous. But, when we think our&s;elves
in the greate&s;t &s;afety, we are &s;uddenly &s;topped
by a frightful pa&s;s; to e&s;cape through which,
we are obliged to glide on our backs along a
large rock, and to de&s;cend by means of a ladder.
When we arrive at the bottom of the ladder, we
&s;tumble for &s;ome time among irregular rocks,
and then the famous grotto pre&s;ents it&s;elf. This
grotto is about 300 fathoms below the &s;urface
of the earth, and it appears to be about 40 fa|thoms
high, and 50 wide. It is full of large
and beautiful &s;talactites, which both depend from
the roof of the vault and cover the floor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tournefort's voyage to the Levant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In that part of Greece called Achaia by the
antients, now Livadia, there is a large cavern in
a mountain which was formerly famous for the
oracles of Trophonius: It is &s;ituated between the
Lake of Livadia and the &s;ea, from which, at the
neare&s;t part, it is di&s;tant about four miles; and
<PB N="454" REF="489">
there are no le&s;s than 40 &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages
through which the waters run under the moun|tain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gordon's Geography, p. 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In all countries that are &s;ubject to earthquakes
or volcano's, caverns are frequent. The &s;tructure
of mo&s;t of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago is ex|ceedingly
cavernous. The i&s;lands in the Indian
ocean, and particularly the Moluccas, appear to
be chiefly &s;upported upon vaults. The land of
the Azores, of the Canaries, of the Cape de
Verd i&s;lands, and, in general, of almo&s;t all &s;mall
i&s;lands, is, in many places, hollow and full of
caverns; becau&s;e the&s;e i&s;lands, as formerly re|marked,
are only the tops of mountains, which
have &s;uffered great convul&s;ions either from vol|cano's,
or by the action of the waters, of fro&s;ts,
and of other injuries of the weather. In the
Cordelieres, where volcano's and earthquakes are
frequent, there are many caverns, precipices,
and aby&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The famous labyrinth in the i&s;land of Crete
is not the work of nature alone. We are a&s;&s;ured
by M. Tournefort, that, in many parts of it, the
operation of men is evident; and, it is probable,
that this is not the only cavern which has been
augmented by art. Mines and quarries are con|&s;tantly
digging; and, after the&s;e have been long
de&s;erted, it is not ea&s;y to determine whether
&s;uch excavations have been the effects of nature
or of art. Some quarries are amazingly exten|&s;ive.
<PB N="455" REF="490">
That of Mae&s;tricht, for in&s;tance, is &s;uffi|cient
to &s;helter 50,000 men, and is &s;upported by
more than 1000 pillars of 20 feet high; and the
earth and rock above is 25 fathoms thick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. abridg. vol. 2. p. 463.</NOTE>. The
&s;alt mines of Poland exhibit excavations &s;till
more exten&s;ive. Near large cities, quarries and
artificial hollows are common. But, we mu&s;t
proceed no farther in detail. Be&s;ides, the opera|tions
of men, however great, will always make
but an incon&s;iderable figure in the hi&s;tory of
nature.</P>
<P>Volcano's and water which form caverns in
the bowels of the earth, produce likewi&s;e on its
&s;urface, fi&s;&s;ures, precipices, and aby&s;&s;es. At
Cajeta in Italy, there is a mountain which had
been formerly &s;plit by an earthquake in &s;uch a
manner, that the &s;eparation &s;eems to have been
made by the hands of men. We have already
mentioned the <HI>Wheel-track,</HI> or great fi&s;&s;ure in
the i&s;land of Machian, the aby&s;s of Mount Ara|rat,
the port or gap in the Cordelieres, that of
Thermopylae, &amp;c. To the&s;e we might add the
gap in the mountain of the Troglodites in Arabia,
and that of the <HI>Ladders</HI> in Savoy, which was
begun by nature, and fini&s;hed by Victor-Ama|daeus.
Con&s;iderable &s;inkings in the earth, the
fall of rocks, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of mountains,
are frequently produced by the waters, as well
as by &s;ubterraneous fires. Of this many ex|amples
might be given.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="491">
'In the month of June 1714, a part of the
mountain of Diableret in Valois fell &s;udden|ly,
and, in a few hours, the &s;ky being &s;erene,
it appeared to have a&s;&s;umed a conical figure.
It de&s;troyed 55 hou&s;es, be&s;ides &s;everal men, and
a great many cattle; and it covered a league
&s;quare with its ruins. The &s;ky was darkened
with the du&s;t; the collection of &s;tones and
earth that were ama&s;&s;ed on the plain, exceeded
30 Rheni&s;h perches in height, dammed up the

accompanied with the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of bitumen,
&s;ulphur, or calcined lime-&s;tone; nor, con&s;e|quently,
of &s;ubterraneous fire: The ba&s;e of

<P>There is a remarkable example of the&s;e &s;ink|ings

hills in the neighbourhood &s;unk in&s;en&s;ibly, with|out
any earthquake or other commotion. The
interior parts of the&s;e hills con&s;i&s;t of rocks and
chalk; and, by their &s;inking, they have pu&s;hed
part of the adjacent land into the &s;ea. A well

Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abridg. vol. 4. p. 250.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1618, the town of Pleurs was buried un|der
the rocks at the foot of which it had been
&s;ituated. In 1678, a great inundation was oc|ca&s;ioned,
<PB N="457" REF="492">
in Ga&s;cony, by the &s;inking of &s;ome
portions of one of the Pyrenees, which forced
out the water that had been pent up in the &s;ub|terraneous
caverns of the&s;e mountains. In the
year 1680, a &s;till greater inundation was pro|duced
in Ireland, by the &s;inking of a mountain
into caverns that had been full of water. It is
not difficult to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of the&s;e ef|fects.
It is well known, that &s;ubterraneous wa|ters
are every where frequent. The&s;e waters
gradually work away &s;and and earth in their
pa&s;&s;ages; and, con&s;equently, they may, in the
cour&s;e of time, de&s;troy the &s;tratum of earth
which &s;erves as a ba&s;is to the mountain: If this
&s;tratum fail more on one &s;ide than on another,
the mountain mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be overturned;
or, if the ba&s;e wa&s;tes gradually and equally
throughout, the mountain will &s;ink, without be|ing
overturned.</P>
<P>Having mentioned a few of tho&s;e convul&s;ions
and changes produced in the earth by what may
be called the accidents of nature, we mu&s;t not
pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures in
the different &s;trata. The&s;e fi&s;&s;ures are obvious,
not only in all rocks and quarries, but in clays,
and in every &s;pecies of earth which has never
been removed from its natural po&s;ition. They
are called perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures; becau&s;e, like the
horizontal &s;trata, they are never oblique, but
from &s;ome accidental change. Woodward and
Ray talk of fi&s;&s;ures, but in a general and confu&s;ed
<PB N="458" REF="493">
manner, and they never mention them under
the appellation of perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, becau&s;e
they imagined that they might be indifferently
either oblique or perpendicular. No author has
hitherto attempted to explain their origin, though
it is apparent, as remarked in a former article,
that they have been occa&s;ioned by the drying of
the materials which compo&s;e the horizontal &s;tra|ta.
In whatever manner this drying &s;hould hap|pen,
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures mu&s;t have been a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
con&s;equence of it; for the matter of the
horizontal &s;trata could not be dimini&s;hed in &s;ize,
without &s;plitting, at different di&s;tances, in a di|rection
perpendicular to the &s;trata them&s;elves.
Under perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, I comprehend, not
only the natural cracks in rocks, but all tho&s;e
&s;eparations which have been effected by convul|&s;ive
accidents. When a ma&s;s of rocks have &s;uf|ered
any con&s;iderable motion, the fi&s;&s;ures are
&s;ometimes placed obliquely; but it is becau&s;e
the ma&s;s it&s;elf is oblique; and the &s;malle&s;t at|tention
to quarries of marble and lime-&s;tone, or
to great chains of rocks, will convince us, that
the general direction of fi&s;&s;ures is perpendicular
to the &s;trata in which they are found.</P>
<P>The bowels of mountains are chiefly compo|&s;ed
of parallel &s;trata of &s;tones and rocks. Be|tween
the parallel &s;trata, we often meet with
beds of matter &s;ofter than &s;tone; and the per|pendicular
fi&s;&s;ures are filled with &s;and, cry&s;tals,
metals, &amp;c. The formation of the&s;e la&s;t bo|dies
<PB N="459" REF="494">
is more recent than that of the horizontal
&s;trata in which &s;ea-&s;hells are found. The rains
have gradually detached the &s;and and earth from
the tops of mountains, and left the &s;tones and
rocks bare, which affords an opportunity of di|&s;tingui&s;hing
with ea&s;e both the parallel &s;trata and
the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures. On the other hand,
the rains and rivers have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively covered the
plains with con&s;iderable quantities of earth, &s;and,
gravel, and other bodies that are either &s;oluble
in water, or ea&s;ily divi&s;ible by it. Of the&s;e have
been formed beds of tufa, of &s;oft &s;tone, of &s;and,
of rounded gravel, and of earth mixed with ve|getable
&s;ub&s;tances. But the&s;e beds contain no
&s;ea-&s;hells, or, at mo&s;t, but fragments of them,
which have been detached from the mountains
along with the earth and gravel. The&s;e recent
beds &s;hould be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from the
antient and original &s;trata, in which we almo&s;t
univer&s;ally find a great number of entire &s;hells
placed in their natural &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In examining the internal order and di&s;tribu|tion
of the materials of a mountain, compo&s;ed of
common &s;tone or calcinable lapidific matter, we
generally find, after removing the vegetable &s;oil,
a bed of gravel, of the &s;ame nature and colour
with the &s;tones that predominate in the moun|tain;
and, under the gravel, we meet with the
&s;olid rock. When the mountain is cut by a
deep trench or <HI>ravine,</HI> the different banks or
&s;trata are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable. Each horizon|tal
<PB N="460" REF="495">
&s;tratum is &s;eparated by a kind of joint or fu|ture,
which is likewi&s;e horizontal. The&s;e &s;trata
generally augment in thickne&s;s, in proportion to
their depth or di&s;tance from the top of the
mountain; and they are all divided, vertically,
by perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures. In general, the fir&s;t
&s;tratum under the gravel, and even the &s;econd,
are not only thinner than tho&s;e which form the
ba&s;e of the mountain, but &s;o much cut by per|pendicular
fi&s;&s;ures, that only &s;mall portions of
them have any coherence. Mo&s;t of the&s;e fi&s;|&s;ures,
which exactly re&s;emble the cracks in
earth that has been dried, gradually di&s;appear as
they de&s;cend, and, at the ba&s;e of the mountain,
where they cut the larger &s;trata in a more regu|lar
and more perpendicular manner than tho&s;e
near the &s;urface, their number is much &s;maller.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trata of rock often extend, without in|terruption,
to great di&s;tances. Stones of the
&s;ame &s;pecies likewi&s;e are almo&s;t uniformly found
in oppo&s;ite mountains, whether they be &s;epa|rated
by a narrow neck or a valley; and the
&s;trata never entirely di&s;appear, unle&s;s when the
mountain terminates in a large and level plain.
Sometimes we find, between the vegetable &s;oil
and the gravel, a &s;tratum of marle, which com|municates
its colour, and other qualities, to the
neighbouring beds: The perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures
in the inferior rocks are, in this ca&s;e, filled with
marle, where it acquires a hardne&s;s equal, in ap|pearance,
to that of the &s;urrounding &s;tone; but,
<PB N="461" REF="496">
when expo&s;ed to the air, it &s;plits, and becomes
&s;oft and ductile.</P>
<P>The beds of &s;tone which compo&s;e the top of
the mountains are generally &s;oft and tender, but
tho&s;e near the ba&s;e are exceedingly hard. The
fir&s;t is commonly white, and of a grain &s;o fine
as to be hardly perceptible. In proportion as
they de&s;cend, the rocks become more compact,
and have a better grain; and the lowe&s;t beds are
not only harder than the &s;uperior ones, but are
al&s;o more compact and more heavy. Their
grain is fine and brilliant; and they are often
&s;o brittle as to break as purely and neatly as
flint.</P>
<P>The heart of a mountain, then, is compo&s;ed
of different &s;trata of &s;tones, which are harder or
&s;ofter in proportion to their di&s;tance from the
&s;ummit; and they are broad at the ba&s;e, and
&s;harp and narrow at the top. The la&s;t is, in|deed,
a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the fir&s;t: For, as the
&s;tones grow harder as they de&s;cend, it is natural
to think, that the currents, and other motions of
the water, which &s;cooped out the vallies, and
formed the contours of the mountains, mu&s;t
have gradually con&s;umed, by their lateral fric|tion,
the materials of which the mountains are
compo&s;ed; and that this con&s;umption would be
proportioned to the hardne&s;s or &s;oftne&s;s of the
matter acted upon. But, as the upper &s;trata are
known to be &s;ofte&s;t, and as their den&s;ity increa&s;es
according as they approach the ba&s;e, the moun|tains
<PB N="462" REF="497">
mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, have a&s;&s;umed their pre|&s;ent
inclined, and &s;omewhat conical figure.
This is one great cau&s;e of the declivity of
mountains; and it mu&s;t always become more
gentle, in proportion as the earth and gravel are
brought down by the rain from their &s;ummits.
For the&s;e rea&s;ons it is that the declivity of hills
and mountains, compo&s;ed of calcinable bodies, is
le&s;s than that of tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t of granite,
or of flint, in large ma&s;&s;es. The latter generally
ri&s;e almo&s;t perpendicularly to very great heights;
becau&s;e, in the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of vitrifiable matter, the
&s;uperior, as well as the inferior &s;trata, are ex|tremely
hard, and have pre&s;ented nearly an equal
re&s;i&s;tance to the operation of the waters.</P>
<P>Though, in the tops of &s;ome hills which are
flat, and pretty exten&s;ive, we find hard &s;tone
immediately under the vegetable &s;oil; yet it
&s;hould be remarked, that, in every example of
this kind, what appears to be the &s;ummit of a
hill is only a continuation of &s;ome more eleva|ted
hill in the neighbourhood, the upper &s;trata of
which con&s;i&s;t of &s;oft, and the inferior &s;trata of
hard &s;tone; and the hard &s;tone found on the
top of the fir&s;t hill is only a continuation of the
under &s;trata of the higher hill.</P>
<P>Still, however, on the tops of hills which are
not &s;urmounted by higher grounds, the &s;tone
is mo&s;tly of a &s;oft and friable nature; and hard
&s;tone cannot be had without digging to a con&s;i|derable
depth. It is between the&s;e layers of
<PB N="463" REF="498">
hard &s;tone only that marble is to be found; and
it is variegated with different colours by metalic
&s;ub&s;tances carried down by rain-water, and fil|trated
through the &s;trata: And it is probable
that, in every country which furni&s;hes &s;tones,
marble would be found, if pits were dug to a
&s;ufficient depth: <HI>Quoto enim,</HI> &s;ays Pliny, <HI>loco non
&s;uum marmor invenitur?</HI> It is, in fact, a more
common &s;tone than is generally imagined, and
di&s;&s;ers from other &s;tones only in the finene&s;s of
its grain, which renders it compact, and &s;u&s;cep|tible
of a fine and brilliant poli&s;h.</P>
<P>Both the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, and the hori|zontal
joints of quarries, are often filled, or en|cru&s;ted,
with concretions, which are &s;ometimes
tran&s;parent, and of regular figures, as cry&s;tals,
and &s;ometimes earthy and opaque. Water runs
through the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, and even
penetrates the clo&s;e texture of the &s;tone it&s;elf.
Stones that are porous imbibe water &s;o copiou&s;ly,
that fro&s;t &s;plits them in pieces. The rain-waters,
by filtrating through different &s;trata, are impreg|nated
with a great variety of &s;ub&s;tances. They
fir&s;t &s;ink through the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures; they
then penetrate the &s;trata of &s;tone, and depo&s;ite
in the horizontal joints, as well as in the per|pendicular
fi&s;&s;ures, &s;uch matter as they collect
in their cour&s;e, and give ri&s;e to different concre|tions,
according to the nature of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tan|ces.
For example, when the water filtrates
through marle, clay, or &s;oft &s;tone, the matter
<PB N="464" REF="499">
which it depo&s;ites is nothing but a fine pure
marle, and commonly appears in the perpendi|cular
fi&s;&s;ures under the form of a porous, &s;oft,
white, light &s;ub&s;tance, known among natura|li&s;ts
under the name of <HI>Lac Lunae, or Medulla
Saxi.</HI></P>
<P>When veins of water, charged with &s;toney
matter, run along the horizontal joints of &s;oft
&s;tone or chalk, this matter adheres to the &s;urface
of the &s;tones, and forms a white, &s;caly, light,
and &s;pongy cru&s;t, which, from its re&s;emblance
to the agaric, has been called <HI>mineral agaric.</HI> But,
if the &s;trata through which the water penetrates
be hard &s;tone, the filter being clo&s;er, the water
it lets pa&s;s will be impregnated with a &s;toney
matter more pure and homogeneous; and, con&s;e|quently,
the particles being capable of a more
compact and intimate union, will form concre|tions
nearly of equal den&s;ity with the &s;tone it|&s;elf,
and &s;omewhat tran&s;parent. In quarries of
this kind, the &s;urface of the &s;tones are encru&s;ted
with undulated concretions, which entirely fill
up the horizontal joints.</P>
<P>In grottos and cavities of rocks, which may
be regarded as the ba&s;ins or common &s;ewers of
the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, the different directions
of the veins of water give different forms to the
concretions which re&s;ult from them. The&s;e
forms are generally wreathed, or re&s;emble an in|verted
cone, attached to the roof of the cavern;
or, rather, they are white, hollow cylinders, com|po&s;ed
<PB N="465" REF="500">
of concentric coats. The impregnated
waters &s;ometimes fall in drops upon the floor of
the cavern, and form columns, and a thou&s;and
whim&s;ical figures, to which naturali&s;ts have
given the different appellations of <HI>&s;talactites,</HI>
<HI>&s;telegmites, o&s;teocollae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> when the concreting juices i&s;&s;ue im|mediately
from marble, or very hard &s;tone, the
lapidific matter is rather di&s;&s;olved than &s;u&s;pended
in the water, and it forms a kind of columns
with triangular points, which are tran&s;parent,
and con&s;i&s;t of oblique coats. This &s;ub&s;tance is
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>&s;par</HI> or <HI>&s;palt.</HI> It is
tran&s;parent and colourle&s;s, excepting when the
&s;tone or marble through which it filtrates con|tains
metallic particles. This &s;par is of equal
hardne&s;s with the &s;tone it&s;elf, and it di&s;&s;olves in
acids, and calcines with the &s;ame degree of heat.
Hence it is evident, that &s;par is a true &s;tone, and
perfectly homogeneous. It may even be &s;aid
to be pure and elementary &s;tone.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t naturali&s;ts, however, con&s;ider this as a
di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance, exi&s;ting independent of &s;tone:
It is the lapidi&s;ic or cry&s;talline juice, which, in
their e&s;timation, not only cements the particles
of common &s;tone, but even tho&s;e of flint. This
juice, they alledge, daily augments the den&s;ity
of &s;tones by reiterated filtrations, and at la&s;t
converts them into flint: When concreted into
&s;par, it perpetually receives fre&s;h &s;upplies of &s;till
purer juice, which increa&s;es both its hardne&s;s
<PB N="466" REF="501">
and its den&s;ity, till it changes to the con&s;i&s;tence
of gla&s;s, then to that of cry&s;tal, and at la&s;t it is
converted into genuine diamond.</P>
<P>But, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, Why does the lapi|dific
juice produce only &s;tone in &s;ome provinces,
and nothing but flint in others? It may be &s;aid,
that the one province is le&s;s antient than the
other, and that the juice has not had time &s;uffi|cient
to complete its natural operations. But in
this there is not the &s;hadow of probability. Be|&s;ides,
from whence does this juice proceed? If it
gives ri&s;e to &s;tones and flints, from whence does
it derive its own origin? It is obvious, that it
has no exi&s;tence independent of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances
which alone can impart to the water that pene|trates
them a petrifying quality, which uniform|ly
corre&s;ponds with their nature and peculiar
properties. Thus, when it filtrates through
&s;tone, it produces &s;par; when it i&s;&s;ues from flint,
it forms cry&s;tal; and there are as many &s;pecies
of this juice as of bodies from which it proceeds.
Experience confirms this account of the matter.
The waters which filtrate through quarries of
common &s;tone form tender and calcinable con|cretions
&s;imilar to the &s;tones them&s;elves. On
the other hand, the waters which ex&s;ude from
granite or from flint, produce concretions hard
and vitrifiable, and they have all the other pro|perties
of flint, as the former had all tho&s;e of
&s;tone. In the &s;ame manner, the waters that fil|trate
through mineral and metallic &s;ub&s;tances,
<PB N="467" REF="502">
give ri&s;e to pyrites, marca&s;ites, and metallic
grains.</P>
<P>It was formerly remarked, that all matter
might be divided into the two great cla&s;&s;es of
Vitrifiable and Calcinable. Clay and flint, marle
and &s;tone, may be regarded as the two extremes
of each cla&s;s, the intervals between which are
filled with an almo&s;t infinite variety of mixts,
that have always one or other of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances
for their ba&s;is.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tances belonging to the fir&s;t cla&s;s can
never acquire the properties of tho&s;e of the lat|ter.
Stone, however antient, will for ever be
equally removed from the nature of flint, as clay
is from that of marle. No known agent can ever
force them from the circle of combinations pe|culiar
to their nature. Places which produce
marble and &s;tone will always continue to do &s;o
as infallibly as tho&s;e which produce only &s;and|&s;tone,
flint, and granite, will never produce lime|&s;tone
or marble.</P>
<P>If we examine the order and di&s;tribution of
the materials of a hill compo&s;ed of vitrifiable
&s;ub&s;tances, we will generally find, under the ve|getable
&s;oil, a &s;tratum of clay, which is likewi&s;e
a vitrifiable &s;ub&s;tance analogous to flint, and
which, as already remarked, is only a decompo|&s;ition
of vitrifiable &s;and; or rather, we will find,
under the &s;oil, a &s;tratum of vitrifiable &s;and. This
&s;tratum of clay or of &s;and corre&s;ponds with the
bed of gravel in hills con&s;i&s;ting of calcinable
<PB N="468" REF="503">
matters. Below the &s;tratum of clay or of &s;and,
we meet with &s;ome beds of free-&s;tone, which
&s;eldom exceed half a foot in thickne&s;s, and they
are divided into &s;mall portions by perpendicular
fi&s;&s;ures. Under the&s;e are &s;everal &s;trata of the
&s;ame matter, and likewi&s;e beds of vitrifiable
&s;and. In proportion as we de&s;cend, the free|&s;tone
is more den&s;e, and its thickne&s;s increa&s;es.
Below the&s;e, we find what I call <HI>live-rock,</HI> or
<HI>flint in large ma&s;&s;es,</HI> a &s;ub&s;tance &s;o hard as to re|&s;i&s;t
the file, and all kinds of acids, more power|fully
than vitrifiable &s;and or powder of gla&s;s,
upon which aquafortis &s;eems to have &s;ome effect.
When &s;truck with another hard body, it throws
out &s;parks of fire, and exhales a penetrating &s;ul|phurcous
vapour. This flinty &s;ub&s;tance is com|monly
found along with beds of clay, of &s;late,
of pit-coal, of vitrifiable &s;and; and it corre&s;ponds
to the &s;trata of hard-&s;tone and marble, which
&s;erve as the ba&s;es of hills that con&s;i&s;t of calci|nable
matter.</P>
<P>The waters, in pa&s;&s;ing through the perpendi|cular
fi&s;&s;ures, and in penetrating the &s;trata of
vitrifiable &s;and, of free-&s;tone, of clay, and of
&s;late, are impregnated with the fine&s;t and mo&s;t ho|mogeneous
particles of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and pro|duce
various concretions, &s;uch as tale, a&s;be&s;tus,
and other bodies which owe their exi&s;tence to
di&s;tillation through vitriable matter.</P>
<P>Flint, notwith&s;tanding its hardne&s;s and den&s;i|ty,
has, like marble and common &s;tone, its exu|dations,
<PB N="469" REF="504">
from which re&s;ult &s;talactites of different
&s;pecies, varying in tran&s;parency, colour, and con|figuration,
according to the nature of the flint
that produces them, and to the different metallic
or heterogeneous particles it contains. Rock|cry&s;tal,
all the precious &s;tones, and even the
diamond it&s;elf, may be regarded as &s;talactites of
this kind. The flints in &s;mall ma&s;&s;es, the &s;trata
or coats of which are generally concentric, are
only &s;talactites, or para&s;itical &s;tones, from the
flints in large ma&s;&s;es; and mo&s;t of the fine opaque
&s;tones are nothing but &s;pecies of flint. The
&s;ub&s;tances produced by the vitrifiable cla&s;s of
bodies are not, as we have &s;een, &s;o various as
the concretions formed by tho&s;e of the calcinable.
Mo&s;t of the concretions formed by flint are hard
and precious &s;tones; but tho&s;e produced by cal|careous
&s;tones are friable, and of no value.</P>
<P>Perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures are found in flint-rocks
as well as in &s;tone; they are even frequently
larger in flint, which proves this &s;ub&s;tance to be
drier than &s;tone. Both the hill con&s;i&s;ting of
calcinable, and that compo&s;ed of vitrifiable mat|ter,
have clay or vitrifiable &s;and for their ba&s;es,
which are the mo&s;t commonly diffu&s;ed matters
of the globe, and which I regard as the lighte&s;t,
being the &s;coriae of the vitrified matter that con|&s;titutes
the interior parts of the earth. Thus all
mountains as well as plains are founded either
on clay or &s;and. We have &s;een, for example,
in the pits of Am&s;terdam, and in that of Marly|la-ville,
<PB N="470" REF="505">
that vitrifiable &s;and was always the
deepe&s;t &s;tratum.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, in mo&s;t bare rocks, that
the walls of perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, whether they
be narrow or wide, corre&s;pond as exactly with
each other as &s;plit pieces of wood. In the large
quarries of Arabia, which con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of gra|nite,
the perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures are frequent; and,
though &s;ome of them are 20 or 30 yards wide,
the &s;ides corre&s;pond exactly, and leave a deep
cavity between them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's Travels.</NOTE>. It is likewi&s;e common to
find, in perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures, &s;hells divided into
two pieces, each piece remaining attached to the
oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the fi&s;&s;ure; which proves, that
the&s;e &s;hells were depo&s;ited in the &s;olid &s;tratum
before it was &s;plit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Woodward, p. 298.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In &s;ome quarries mentioned by Mr Shaw, the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures are exceedingly large; and
for this rea&s;on, perhaps, it is, that they are le&s;s
numerous. In quarries of granite and flint in
large ma&s;&s;es, blocks of &s;tone may be rai&s;ed, as
the obeli&s;ks and columns at Rome, of 60, 80,
100, and 150 feet long, without the lea&s; inter|ruption.
It appears, that the&s;e va&s;t blocks have
been rai&s;ed from the &s;ame quarry, and, like &s;ome
&s;pecies of free-&s;tone, that they may be had of
any given thickne&s;s. In other &s;ub&s;tances, the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures are very narrow, as in clay,
in marle, and in chalk; and they are wider in
<PB N="471" REF="506">
marble and hard &s;tone. Some are imperceptible,
becau&s;e they have been filled with a matter near|ly
&s;imilar to that of the &s;tone it&s;elf; but &s;till
they interrupt the continuity of the &s;tones, and
are called <HI>hairs</HI> by the workmen. I have often
remarked, that the&s;e hairs in marble and &s;tone
differed from perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures only in the
&s;eparation of parts not being complete. The&s;e
&s;pecies of fi&s;&s;ures are filled with a tran&s;parent
matter, which is a true &s;par. In quarries of
free-&s;tone, the fi&s;&s;ures are numerous, and con&s;i|derably
large, becau&s;e rocks of this kind have
often a le&s;s &s;olid ba&s;e, than that which &s;upports
marble or lime-&s;tone, the former generally re&s;t|ing
upon a fine &s;and, and the latter upon clay.
In many places, free-&s;tone is not to be found in
large ma&s;&s;es; and in mo&s;t quarries, where this
&s;tone is good, the blocks lie irregularly upon one
another, in the form of cubes or parallelopipeds,
as in the hills of Fountainbleau, which appear,
at a di&s;tance, like the ruins of old buildings.
This irregular di&s;po&s;ition has been occa&s;ioned by
the &s;andy foundation of the&s;e hills allowing the
blocks to &s;ink and tumble upon each other, e|&s;pecially
where quarries have been formerly
wrought, which has given ri&s;e to a great variety
of fi&s;&s;ures and intervals between the different
blocks: And it may be remarked, in all coun|tries
abounding with &s;and and free-&s;tone, that
there are many fragments of rocks and large
&s;tones in the middle of the plains and vallies;
<PB N="472" REF="507">
and that, on the contrary, in countries abound|ing
with marble and hard &s;tone, the&s;e &s;cattered
fragments, which have rolled down from the
hills, are exceedingly rare. This phaenomenon
is owing to the different &s;olidities of the ba&s;es
upon which the&s;e &s;tones are &s;upported, and to
the extent of the banks of marble or lime-&s;tone,
which is always more con&s;iderable than that of
free-&s;tone.</P>

OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Effects of Rains&mdash;Of Mar&s;hes, Subter|raneous
Wood and Waters.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been remarked, that rains,
and the currents of water which they pro|duce,
continually detach, from the &s;ummits and
&s;ides of the mountains, earth, gravel, &amp;c. and
carry them down to the plains; and that the
rivers tran&s;port part of them to the &s;ea. The
plains, therefore, by fre&s;h accumulations of mat|ter,
are perpetually ri&s;ing higher; and the moun|tains,
for the &s;ame rea&s;on, are con&s;tantly dimi|ni&s;hing
both in &s;ize and elevation. Of the
&s;inking of mountains, Jo&s;eph Blancanus relates
&s;everal facts which were publicly known in his
time. The &s;teeple of the village of Craich, in
the county of Derby, was not vi&s;ible in 1572,
<PB N="474" REF="509">
from a certain mountain, on account of a high|er
mountain which intervened; but, 80 or
100 years afterwards, not only the &s;teeple, but
likewi&s;e part of the church, was vi&s;ible from the
&s;ame &s;tation. Dr Plot gives a &s;imilar example
of a mountain between Sibbertoft and A&s;hby, in
the county of Northampton. Sand, earth, gra|vel,
and &s;mall &s;tones, are not only carried down
by the rains, but they &s;ometimes undermine and
drive before them large rocks, which con&s;ide|rably
dimini&s;h the height of mountains. In ge|nera,
the rocks are pointed and perpendicular
in proportion to the height and &s;teepne&s;s of
mountains. The rocks in high mountains
are very &s;traight and naked. The large frag|ments
that appear in the vallies have been de|tached
by the operation of water and of fro&s;ts.
Thus &s;and and earth are not the only &s;ub&s;tances
detached from mountains by the rains; they at|tack
the harde&s;t rocks, and carry down large frag|ments
of them into the plains. At Nant-phrancon,
in 1685, a part of a large rock, which was &s;up|ported
on a narrow ba&s;e, being undermined by
the waters, fell and &s;plit into a number of frag|ments,
the large&s;t of which made deep trenches
in the plain, cro&s;&s;ed a &s;mall river, and &s;topped
at the other &s;ide of it. To &s;imilar accidents we
mu&s;t a&s;cribe the origin of all tho&s;e large &s;tones
which are found in vallies adjacent to moun|tains.
This phaenomenon, as formerly remark|ed,
is more common in countries where the
<PB N="475" REF="510">
mountains are compo&s;ed of &s;and and free-&s;tone,
than in tho&s;e, the mountains of which con&s;i&s;t of
clay and marble; becau&s;e &s;and is a le&s;s &s;olid ba&s;is
than clay.</P>
<P>To give an idea of the quantity of earth de|tached
from mountains by the rains, we &s;hall
quote a pa&s;&s;age on this &s;ubject from Dr Plot's
natural hi&s;tory of Stafford. He remarks, that
a great number of coins &s;truck in the reign of
Edward IV. i.e. 200 years ago, were found bu|ried
18 feet below the &s;urface: Hence, he con|cludes,
the earth, which is mar&s;hy where the
coins were found, augments about a foot in ele|ven
years, or an inch and a twelfth each year.
A &s;imilar ob&s;ervation may be made on trees bu|ried
17 feet below the &s;urface, under which were
found medals of Julius Cae&s;ar. Thus, the &s;oil
of the plains in con&s;iderably augmented and ele|vated
by the matters wa&s;hed down from the
mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;and, gravel, and earth carried down from
the mountains into the plains, form beds which
ought not to be confounded with the original
&s;trata of the globe. To the former belong the
beds of tufa, of &s;oft &s;tone, and of &s;and and gra|vel
which have been rounded by the operation
of water. To the&s;e may be added tho&s;e beds
of &s;tone which have been formed by a &s;pecies of
incru&s;tation, none of which derive their ori|gin
from the motion or &s;ediments of the &s;ea. In
the&s;e &s;trata of tufa and of &s;oft imperfect &s;tones,
<PB N="476" REF="511">
we find a number of different vegetables, leaves
of trees, land or river-&s;hells, and &s;mall terre&s;tri|al
animals, but never &s;ea-&s;hells, or other produc|tions
of the ocean. This circum&s;tance, joined
to their want of &s;olidity, evidently proves, that
the&s;e &s;trata have been &s;uperinduced upon the dry
&s;urface of the earth, and that they are more re|cent
than tho&s;e of marble and other &s;tones which
contain &s;ea-&s;hells, and have been originally form|ed
by the waters of the &s;ea. Tufa, and other
new &s;tones, appear to be hard and &s;olid when
fir&s;t dug out of the earth; but they &s;oon di&s;&s;olve
after being expo&s;ed to the operation of the wea|ther.
Their &s;ub&s;tance is &s;o different from that
of true &s;tone, that, when broken down in order
to make &s;and of them, they change into a kind
of dirty earth. The &s;talactites, and other &s;tony
concretions which Mr Tournefort apprehended
to be marbles which had vegetated, are not ge|nuine
&s;tones. We have already &s;hown, that the
formation of tufa is not antient; and that it is not
entitled to be ranked with &s;tones. Tufa is an im|perfect
&s;ub&s;tance, differing from &s;tone or earth,
but deriving its origin from both by the inter|vention
of rain-water, in the &s;ame manner as
incru&s;tations are formed by the waters of certain
&s;prings. Thus, the &s;trata of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are
not antient; nor have they, like the other &s;pe|cies,
been formed by &s;ediments from the waters

of half corrupted trees and other vegetables.
which owe their pre&s;ervation to a bituminous
earth. No production of the &s;ea ever appears in
any of the&s;e new &s;trata. But, on the contrary,
we find in them many vegetables, the bones of
land-animals, and land and river-&s;hells. In the
meadows near A&s;hly, in the county of Nort|hampton,
for example, they find, &s;everal feet be|low
the &s;urface, &s;nail-&s;hells, plants, herbs, and
&s;everal &s;pecies of river-&s;hells, well pre&s;erved;
but not a &s;ingle &s;ea-&s;hell appears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See phil. tran&s;. abridg. vol. 4. p, 271.</NOTE>. All the&s;e
new &s;trata have been formed by the waters on
the &s;urface changing their channels, and diffu|&s;ing
them&s;elves on all &s;ides. Part of the&s;e wa|ters
penetrate the earth, and run along the fi&s;|&s;ures
of rocks and &s;tones. The rea&s;on why wa|ter
is &s;eldom found in high countries, or on the
tops of hills, is, becau&s;e high grounds are gene|rally
compo&s;ed of &s;tones and rocks. To find
water, therefore, we mu&s;t cut through the rocks
till we arrive at clay or firm earth. But, when
the thickne&s;s of the rock is great, as in high moun|tains
where the rocks are often 1000 feet high,
it is impo&s;&s;ible to pierce them to their ba&s;e; and
con&s;equently it is impo&s;&s;ible to find water in &s;uch
&s;ituations. There are even exten&s;ive countries
that afford no water, as in Arabia Petrea, which is
a de&s;ert where no rains fall, where the &s;urface of
the earth is covered with burning &s;ands, where
there is hardly the appearance of any &s;oil, and
where nothing but a few &s;ickly plants are pro|duced.
<PB N="478" REF="513">
In this mi&s;erable country, wells are &s;o
rare, that travellers enumerate only five between
Cairo and Mount Sinai, and the water they con|tain
is bitter and &s;alti&s;h.</P>
<P>When the &s;uperficial waters can find no out|lets
or channels, they form mar&s;hes and fens.
The mo&s;t celebrated fens in Europe are tho&s;e of
Ru&s;&s;ia at the &s;ource of the Tanais; and tho&s;e of
Savolaxia and Ena&s;ak in Finland: There are al&s;o
con&s;iderable mar&s;hes in Holland, We&s;tphalia, and
other countries. In A&s;ia are the mar&s;hes of the
Euphrates, of Tartary, and of the Palus Meotis.
However, mar&s;hes are le&s;s frequent in A&s;ia and
Africa than in Europe. But the whole plains
of America may be regarded as one continued
mar&s;h; which is a greater proof of the modern|ne&s;s
of this country, and of the &s;carcity of its
inhabitants, than of their want of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>There are exten&s;ive fens in England, particu|larly
in Lincoln&s;hire, near the &s;ea, which has
lo&s;t a great quantity of land on one &s;ide, and
gained as much on the other. In the antient
&s;oil many trees are found buried under the new
earth which has been tran&s;ported and depo&s;ited
by the water: The &s;ame phaenomenon is com|mon
in the mar&s;hes of Scotland. Near Bruges
in Flanders, in digging to the depth of 40 or 50
feet, a va&s;t number of trees were found, as clo&s;e
to each other as they are in a fore&s;t. Their
trunks, branches, and leaves were &s;o well pre|&s;erved,
that their different &s;pecies could be ea&s;ily
<PB N="479" REF="514">
di&s;tingui&s;hed. About 500 years ago, the earth
where the&s;e trees were found was covered with
the &s;ea; and, before this time, we have neither
record nor tradition of its exi&s;tence. It mu&s;t,
however, have been dry-land when the trees
grew upon it. Thus the land that, in &s;ome re|mote
period, was firm, and covered with wood,
has been overwhelmed with the waters of the
&s;ea, which, in the cour&s;e of time, have depo&s;ited
40 or 50 feet of earth upon the antient &s;urface,
and then retired. A number of &s;ubterraneous
trees was likewi&s;e di&s;covered at Youle in York|&s;hire,
near the river Humber. Some of them
are &s;o large as to be of u&s;e in building; and it is
affirmed, that they are as durable as oak. The
country-people cut them into long thin &s;lices,
and &s;ell them in the neighbouring villages, where
the inhabitants employ them for lighting their
pipes. All the&s;e trees appear to be broken; and
the trunks are &s;eparated from the roots, as if
they had been thrown down by a hurricane or
an inundation. The wood appears to be fir; it
has the &s;ame &s;mell when burnt, and makes the
&s;ame kind of charcoal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. No. 228.</NOTE>. In the I&s;le of Man,
there is a mar&s;h called <HI>Curragh,</HI> about &s;ix miles
long and three broad, where &s;ubterraneous fir|trees
are found; and, though 18 or 20 feet be|low
the &s;urface, they &s;tand firm on their roots<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ray's Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 232.</NOTE>.
The&s;e trees are common in the mar&s;hes and bogs
<PB N="480" REF="515">
of Somer&s;et, Che&s;ter, Lanca&s;hire, and Stafford.
In &s;ome places there are &s;ubterraneous trees
which have been cut, &s;awed, and &s;quared by the
hands of men; and even axes, and other imple|ments,
are often found near them. Between
Birmingham and Bromley, in the county of
Lincoln, there are hills of a fine light &s;and,
which is blown about by the winds, and tran&s;|ported
by the rains, leaving bare the roots of
large firs, in which the impre&s;&s;ions of the ax are
&s;till exceedingly apparent. The&s;e hills have un|que&s;tionably
been formed, like downs, by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
accumulations of &s;and tran&s;ported by the
motions of the &s;ea. Subterraneous trees are al|&s;o
frequent in the mar&s;hes of Holland, Frizeland,
and near Groningen, which abound in turfs.</P>
<P>Subterraneous trees are of different &s;pecies,
viz. firs, oaks, birch, beech, yew, hawthorn, wil|low,
a&s;h, &amp;c. In the fens of Lincoln, along
the river Ou&s;e, and on Hatfield-chace in York|&s;hire,
the&s;e trees &s;tand erect, as if they were
growing in a fore&s;t. The oaks are extremely
hard, and are u&s;ed in building, where they are
&s;aid to la&s;t long, which I think improbable, as
all the &s;pecimens I have examined lo&s;e their &s;o|lidity,
after being dried and expo&s;ed to the air.
The a&s;hes are tender, and &s;oon fall into du&s;t.
Some of the&s;e trees are evidently cut and &s;awed
with in&s;truments; and the hatchets, which are
&s;ometimes found along with them, re&s;emble the
knives formerly u&s;ed in &s;acrifices. Be&s;ides trees,

we al&s;o meet with va&s;t quantities of filberds, a|corns,

Scotland, and Ireland, as well as in the

Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. abridg. vol. 4. p. 218. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>For four miles round the town of Modena,
whenever the earth is dug to the depth of 63
feet, the workmen pierce about five feet more
with a boring in&s;trument, through which the
water ru&s;hes up with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that it
fills the wells to the top, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly;
the water in the&s;e wells continues perpetually,
and is neither augmented nor dimini&s;hed by
rains or drought. What is &s;till more remark|able
in this &s;pot, whenever the workmen dig to
the depth of 14 feet, they find the rubbi&s;h and
ruins of an antient city, paved &s;treets, hou&s;es,
and different pieces of Mo&s;aic work. Below
this, the earth is &s;olid, and appears not to have
been moved. Still lower, however, we find a
moi&s;t &s;oil mixed with vegetables; and, at the
depth of 26 feet, entire trees, as filberds, with
nuts upon them, and great quantities of branches
and leaves. At 28 feet, there is a &s;tratum of
&s;oft chalk, 11 feet thick, mixed with &s;ea-&s;hells;
and, after this, we &s;till meet with vegetables,
leaves and branches of trees, till we arrive at the
depth of 63 feet, where there is a &s;tratum of
&s;and mixed with gravel and &s;hells, &s;imilar to
tho&s;e that appear on the coa&s;ts of Italy. The&s;e

&s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;trata lie always in the &s;ame order,
wherever pits have been dug; and &s;ometimes
the boring in&s;trument falls in with the trunks of
large trees, which the workmen pierce with
great labour: They likewi&s;e meet with bones of
animals, pit-coal, flints, and pieces of iron. Ra|mazzini,

have &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">wn that they have been produced by
no other cau&s;e than the waters that run or are

<HEAD>PROOFS
OF THE
THEORY OF THE EARTH.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the changes of Land into Sea, and of Sea into
Land.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what we have remarked in Article 1.
7. 8. and 9. it is apparent, that the ter|re&s;trial
globe has undergone &s;ome great and ge|neral
changes; and it is equally certain, from
what has been delivered in the other articles,
that the &s;urface of the earth has &s;uffered parti|cular
alterations. Though we are not &s;ufficient|ly
acquainted with the order or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e particular changes, we know the principal
cau&s;es which produced them. We can even di|&s;tingui&s;h
their different effects; and, if we were
able to collect all the facts which natural and ci|vil
hi&s;tory afford concerning the revolutions
<PB N="484" REF="519">
which have happened on the &s;urface of the earth,
our theory would unque&s;tionably receive addi|tional
&s;upports, and would be rendered &s;till more
&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>One of the principal cau&s;es of the&s;e revolu|tions
is the motion of the &s;ea, which has conti|nued
invariably the &s;ame in all ages; for, as the
&s;un, the moon, the earth, the waters, the air, &amp;c.
have exi&s;ted from the moment of creation, the
effects of the tides, of the motion of the &s;ea from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, of the currents, and of the winds,
mu&s;t have been felt for an equal time: And,
even &s;uppo&s;ing the axis of the globe to have
formerly had a different inclination, and that
the continents, as well as the &s;eas, were diffe|rently
di&s;po&s;ed, the motions of the ocean, and
the cau&s;es and effects of the winds, would have
remained unaltered. In whatever part of the
globe the immen&s;e quantities of water which fill
the ocean were collected, they would be &s;ubject
to the &s;ame motions.</P>
<P>It was no &s;ooner &s;u&s;pected that our continent
might formerly have been the bottom of the
&s;ea, than the fact became inconte&s;tible. The
&s;poils of the ocean found in every place, the ho|rizontal
po&s;ition of the &s;trata, and the corre&s;pon|ding
angles of the hills and mountains, appear|ed
to be convincing proofs; for, when we ex|amine
the plains, the vallies, and the hills, it is
apparent, that the &s;urface of the earth has been
figured by the waters. When we de&s;cend into
<PB N="485" REF="520">
the bowels of the earth, it is equally evident,
that tho&s;e &s;tones which include &s;ea-&s;hells, have
been formed by &s;ediments depo&s;ited by the wa|ters,
&s;ince the &s;ea-&s;hells them&s;elves are impreg|nated
with the &s;ame matter that &s;urrounds them.
And, in fine, if we con&s;ider the corre&s;ponding
angles of the hills and mountains, we cannot he|&s;itate
in pronouncing, that they received their
configuration and direction from currents of the
ocean. It is true, that, &s;ince the earth was fir&s;t
left uncovered, the original figure of its &s;urface
has been gradually changing: The mountains
have dimini&s;hed in height; the plains have been
elevated; the angles of the hills have become
more obtu&s;e; tho&s;e bodies which have been rol|led
about by the rivers have received a roundi&s;h
figure; new beds of tufa, of &s;oft &s;tone, of gra|vel,
&amp;c. have been formed. But every thing
has remained e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame. The antient
form is &s;till recogni&s;able; and I am per&s;uaded,
that every man may be convinced, by his own
eyes, of the truth of all that has been advanced
on this &s;ubject; and that, whoever has attended
to the proofs I have given, mu&s;t be fully &s;atis|fied,
that the earth was formerly under the
waters of the ocean, and that the &s;urface which
we now behold, received its configuration from
the currents and movements of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, that the principal
motion of the &s;ea is from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The
ocean, accordingly, &s;eems to have gained from
<PB N="486" REF="521">
the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of both the Old and the New
Continent, a &s;pace of no le&s;s than 500 leagues.
For the proofs, we mu&s;t refer to Art. IX. and
&s;hall only here add, that the direction of all
&s;traits which join two &s;eas, is from ea&s;t to we&s;t.
The &s;traits of Magellan, of Frobi&s;her, of Hud|&s;on,
of Ceylon, of the &s;ea of Corea, and of
Kamt&s;chatka, lie all in this direction, and ap|pear
to have been formed by the irruption of
the waters, which, being forcibly pu&s;hed from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, have opened the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, where
the waters &s;till pre&s;erve a &s;tronger current in this
direction than in any other; for, in all &s;traits of
this kind, the tides are high and violent; but,
in tho&s;e &s;ituated on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts, as that of
Gibraltar, of the Sound, &amp;c. the motion of the
tides is almo&s;t imperceptible.</P>
<P>The inequalities at the bottom of the &s;ea
change the direction of the motion of the wa|ters.
The&s;e inequalities have originated from
&s;ediments and matters tran&s;ported by the tides,
or by other movements in the water: The tides
are the principal, and fir&s;t, though not the only
cau&s;e which produced the&s;e inequalities. The
wind is another cau&s;e; though its action be|gins
at the &s;urface, it agitates the whole ma&s;s to
the greate&s;t depths, as appears from particular
bodies which are detached from the bottom of
the &s;ea, and thrown a&s;hore only during violent
&s;torms.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="522">
It has already been mentioned, that, between
the Tropics, and even &s;ome degrees beyond them,
an ea&s;t wind blows perpetually. This wind,
which a&s;&s;i&s;ts the general motion of the &s;ea from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, is as antient as the tides; becau&s;e
it is occa&s;ioned by the rarefaction of the air
produced by the heat of the &s;un. There are
two combined cau&s;es, therefore, the operation
of which is greate&s;t in the equatorial regions:
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The tides, which are greate&s;t in the &s;outhern
latitudes; and, 2<HI>d,</HI> The ea&s;t winds, which con|&s;tantly
reign in the&s;e climates. The&s;e two cau&s;es
have concurred, from the fir&s;t formation of the
earth, in producing a motion in the waters from
ea&s;t to we&s;t, and in agitating them more vio|lently
in this region of the globe than in any
other. It is for this rea&s;on that we find between
the Tropics the greate&s;t inequalities upon the
&s;urface of the earth. That part of Africa which
lies between the&s;e circles, is nothing but a group
of different chains of mountains, extending, for
the mo&s;t part, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, as appears
from the direction of the great rivers which tra|ver&s;e
this unknown region. The &s;ame ob&s;er|vation
holds with regard to the countries both
of A&s;ia and America, which lie between the
Tropics.</P>
<P>The general motion of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to
we&s;t, combined with the tides, currents, and
winds, produce a variety of effects, both on the
bottom of the ocean, and on the coa&s;ts. Vare|nius
<PB N="488" REF="523">
thinks it extremely probable, that the gulfs
and &s;traits have been formed by reiterated efforts
of the ocean again&s;t the land; that the gulfs of
Arabia, of Bengal, and of Cambaya, have been
produced by irruptions of the waters, as well as
the &s;traits between Sicily and Italy, between
Ceylon and India, between Greece and Euboea,
&amp;c.; that the probability of &s;uch irruptions, and
of certain lands having been de&s;erted by the
&s;ea, is &s;trengthened by the &s;carcity of i&s;lands in
the middle of great &s;eas, and by their never ap|pearing
there in groups; that, in the immen&s;e
&s;pace occupied by the Pacific Ocean, there are
only two or three &s;mall i&s;lands near the centre
of it; and that, in the va&s;t Atlantic Ocean be|tween
Africa and Bra&s;il, we find only the &s;mall
i&s;lands of St Helena and A&s;cen&s;ion: But all
i&s;lands lie near large continents, as tho&s;e of the
Archipelago, which approach the continents both
of Europe and A&s;ia; the Canaries are near Afri|ca;
the Indian i&s;lands lie near the ea&s;tern part
of the continent of A&s;ia; the Antilles lie off the
coa&s;t of America; and the Azores alone lie at a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance both from Africa and Ame|rica.</P>
<P>The popular tradition among the inhabitants
of Ceylon, that their i&s;land had been &s;eparated
from the penin&s;ula of India by an irruption of
the &s;ea, is extremely probable. The great num|ber
of rocks and &s;hoals between the i&s;land of
Sumatra and the continent demon&s;trate their
<PB N="489" REF="524">
former union. The Malabarians affirm, that
the Maldiva i&s;lands made once a part of the con|tinent
of India; and, in general, we may believe,
without he&s;itation, that all the ea&s;tern i&s;lands
have been &s;eparated from continents by irruptions
of the ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geog. p. 203, 217, and 220.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Great Britain appears to have
been formerly a part of the continent; and that
England was once joined to France, the narrow|ne&s;s
of the &s;trait, and the &s;amene&s;s of the &s;trata
of &s;tone and of earth on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides, are
a &s;ufficient indication. If we &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays Dr
Wallis, that France was connected to England
by an i&s;thmus between Calais and Dover, two
tides would nece&s;&s;ary &s;trike with violence again&s;t
each &s;ide of it twice every twenty-four hours;
and the operation of the &s;ea, both on the ea&s;t
and we&s;t of this i&s;thmus, would, in the cour&s;e
of time, nece&s;&s;arily wear away &s;uch a nar|row
neck of land as we have &s;uppo&s;ed. The
tides acting with violence not only again&s;t
this i&s;thmus, but al&s;o again&s;t the coa&s;ts of France
and of England, mu&s;t have carried away va&s;t
quantities of earth, &s;and, and clay, from every
part on which the waves exerted their fury.
Their cour&s;e, however, being interrupted by the
i&s;thmus, they would not, as might be imagined,
depo&s;ite their &s;ediments upon its &s;hores, but
would tran&s;port and depo&s;ite them on the great
<PB N="490" REF="525">
plain which now forms the mar&s;h of Romney,
and is four miles broad and eight long; for no
man, who has ever &s;een this plain, can po&s;&s;ibly
doubt of its having been formerly covered with
the &s;ea, as, without the intervention of the dikes
of Dimchurch, the &s;pring-tides would &s;till over|flow
a great part of it.</P>
<P>The German &s;ea would act in the &s;ame man|ner
again&s;t this i&s;thmus and again&s;t the coa&s;ts of
England and Flanders, and would carry its &s;edi|ments
into Holland and Zeland, the &s;oil of which
was formerly under the waters, though it is now
elevated 40 feet above them. On the Engli&s;h
coa&s;t, the German &s;ea mu&s;t have occupied that
large valley which commences at Sandwich,
runs by Canterbury, Chatham, Chilham, and
terminates at A&s;hford, a &s;pace of more than 20
miles. Here the land is much more elevated
than it was in antient times; for, at Chatham,
the bones of an hyppopotamos have been found
buried at the depth of 17 feet, and likewi&s;e
anchors of &s;hips, and &s;ea-&s;hells.</P>
<P>Nothing is more apparent than that new lands
are formed by the earth, &s;and, clay, &amp;c. tran|&s;ported
and depo&s;ited by the &s;ea: For, in the
i&s;land of Orkney, which is adjacent to the mar&s;hy
coa&s;t of Romney, there was a flat &s;pace of ground
in continual danger of being overflowed by the
river Rother; but this flat, in le&s;s than 60 years,
has been con&s;iderably elevated by the acce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="491" REF="526">
of fre&s;h matter brought in by every tide. This
river has be&s;ide deepened its channel &s;o greatly,
that its mouth, which, le&s;s than 50 years ago,
was fordable by men, is now capable of receiving
large ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner has the bank of &s;and,
which runs obliquely from the coa&s;t of Norfolk
to that of Zeland, been formed. This bank is
the place where the German and French &s;eas
encounter &s;ince the rupture of the i&s;thmus; and
it is here where the waters depo&s;ite the earth and
&s;and which they carry off from the coa&s;ts. It
is even not improbable but that this bank of &s;and
may, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, give ri&s;e to a new
i&s;thmus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See philo&s;ophical tran&s;act. abridg. vol. 4. p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, &s;ays Mr Ray, that
the i&s;land of Great Britain was formerly joined
to France: Whether it was disjoined by an earth|quake,
by an irruption of the ocean, or by the
operation of men, we know not. But the for|mer
junction of Britain to the continent is ap|parent
from the identity of the rocks and differ|ent
&s;trata, at the &s;ame elevation, on the oppo&s;ite
coa&s;ts; and from the &s;imilar extent of the rocks
on each &s;ide, being both about &s;ix miles. The
narrowne&s;s of this &s;trait, which exceeds not 24
Engli&s;h miles, and its &s;hallowne&s;s, when com|pared
to the depth of the neighbouring &s;ea, ren|der
it probable that England has been &s;eparated
from France by &s;ome accident. To the&s;e proofs
<PB N="492" REF="527">
we might add, that wolves and bears formerly
exi&s;ted in this i&s;land: It is not probable that the&s;e
animals could &s;wim over, nor that &s;uch de&s;truc|tive
creatures would be tran&s;ported by men; for,
in general, the noxious animals of the continent
are found in all tho&s;e i&s;lands which are very near
it, but never in tho&s;e that are remote. This fact
was remarked by the Spaniards when they ar|rived
in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ray's di&s;cour&s;es, p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the reign of Henry I. of England, a part
of Flanders was overflowed by an irruption of
the &s;ea. In 1446, more than 10,000 per&s;ons
were drowned by a &s;imilar irruption in the ter|ritory
of Dordrecht, and more than 100,000
round Dullart in Fri&s;eland and in Zeland. In
the&s;e two provinces, above 300 villages were
overflowed. The tops of their towers and &s;pires
are &s;till vi&s;ible above the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P>From the coa&s;ts of France, England, Holland,
and Germany, the &s;ea has in many places re|treated.
Hubert Thomas, in his de&s;cription of
the country of Liege, a&s;&s;ures us, that the walls
of the city of Tongres were formerly &s;urround|ed
by the &s;ea, though it is now 35 leagues di|&s;tant
from it. This he proves by &s;everal &s;atis|factory
rea&s;ons: Among others, he informs us,
that, in his time, the iron rings to which &s;hips
were fa&s;tened, &s;till remained in the walls. The
fens of Lincoln, of the i&s;land of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence in France, may be regarded as
<PB N="493" REF="528">
lands abandoned by the &s;ea, which has likewi&s;e,
&s;ince the year 1665, retired con&s;iderably from
the mouth of the Rhone. At the mouth of the
Arno in Italy, a large quantity of land has been
gained from the &s;ea; and Ravenna, which was
formerly a harbour, is no longer a &s;ea-port.
The whole of Holland appears to be new land:
The &s;urface of the ground is nearly on a level
with the &s;ea, although it has received daily ele|vations
from the mud and earths tran&s;ported by
the Rhine, the Mae&s;e, &amp;c.; for the &s;oil of Holland
was formerly, in many places, computed to be
50 feet below the bottom of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that, in the year 860, a
furious tempe&s;t drove &s;uch quantities of &s;and up|on
the coa&s;t, that the mouth of the Rhine near
Catt was entirely blocked up; and that this river
overflowed the whole country, overturned trees
and hou&s;es, and at la&s;t emptied it&s;elf into the
channel of the Mae&s;e. In 1421, another inun|dation
&s;eparated the city of Dordrecht from the
main land, overwhelmed 72 villages, and drown|ed
100,000 &s;ouls, be&s;ide a va&s;t number of cattle.
The dike of I&s;&s;el was broke down in 1638, by
the ice-boards from the Rhine &s;hutting up the
pa&s;&s;age of the water, which occa&s;ioned in the
dike an opening of &s;everal fathoms, and a great
part of the province was laid under water before
the breach could be repaired. The province of
Zeland, in 1682, &s;uffered a &s;imilar inundation,
which drowned more than 30 villages; and an
<PB N="494" REF="529">
amazing number of men and cattle peri&s;hed, ha|ving
been &s;urpri&s;ed by the waters in the night|time.
The lo&s;s would have been &s;till greater,
had not a &s;outh-ea&s;t wind oppo&s;ed the motion
of the waves; for there was &s;uch a &s;well in the
&s;ea, that the water ro&s;e 18 feet above the highe&s;t
ground in the province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyag. hi&s;t. de l'Europe, tom. 5. p. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The harbour of Hithe, in the county of Kent,
is entirely blocked up, notwith&s;tanding much
labour and expence be&s;towed, on different occa|&s;ions,
to clear it. For &s;everal miles round, we
find an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity of &s;hells and other
&s;ea-bodies, which had been accumulated in an|tient
times, and which are now covered with
&s;oil, and afford excellent pa&s;turage. The &s;ea,
on the other hand, often encroaches upon the
land; as, for example, the lands of Goodwin,
which formerly belonged to a nobleman of that
name, are now converted into &s;ands, and are
covered with the waters of the ocean. Thus the
&s;ea gains upon &s;ome coa&s;ts, and lo&s;es upon others,
according to their different &s;ituations and cir|cum&s;tances<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See phil. tran&s;. abridg. vol. 4. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Calecut was formerly a celebrated city, and

pa&s;t, has gained greatly upon this coa&s;t,
now covers mo&s;t of the antient city. The ve&s;|&s;els

<P>The province of Jucatan, a penin&s;ula in the
Gulf of Mexico, was formerly a part of the &s;ea.
This neck of land &s;tretches about 100 leagues
in length, and is no where above 25 leagues
broad. The air is hot and moi&s;t. The earth
furni&s;hes plenty of water, though, in &s;o large a
country, there are neither rivers nor brooks; and,
when pits are dug, &s;uch multitudes of &s;hells e|very
where appear, as leave little room for doubt|ing
that this whole tract was formerly a part of
the ocean.</P>
<P>It is a tradition among the inhabitants of Ma|labar,

<P><PB N="496" REF="531">
The number of the&s;e i&s;lands is &s;o great, and they

<P>The i&s;land of Ceylon, tho&s;e of Rammanakoiel,

&s;ea has encroached 30 or 40 leagues on the
north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of Ceylon.</P>
<P>The &s;ea appears to have lately abandoned ma|ny
of the promontories and i&s;lands of America.
We have already remarked, that the territory of
Jucatan is full of &s;hells; the &s;ame phaenomenon
takes place in the low grounds of Martinico and
the other i&s;lands of the Antilles. The inhabi|tants
di&s;tingui&s;h the earth below the &s;urface by
the name of <HI>lime</HI>; becau&s;e they make lime of
the &s;hells, great banks of which lie immediately
under the vegetable &s;oil<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Nouv. Voyages aux i&s;les de l'Amerique.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome lands which the &s;ea alternate|ly
covers and leaves bare, as in &s;everal i&s;lands of
<PB N="497" REF="532">
Norway, Scotland, the Maldiva's, the gulf of
Cambaya, &amp;c. The Baltic-&s;ea has gradually
gained a great part of Pomerania; and it has
covered and de&s;troyed the celebrated port of Vi|neta.
In the &s;ame manner, the Norwegian &s;ea
has advanced into the continent, and formed
&s;everal i&s;lands. The German &s;ea has incroach|ed
upon Holland, near Catt, to &s;uch a degree,
that the ruins of an antient Roman citadel,
which was formerly &s;ituated on the coa&s;t, lie
now at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in the &s;ea. The
mar&s;hy ground in the i&s;land of Ely, and the
Crau of Provence, are, on the contrary, lands
which the &s;ea has de&s;erted. The Downs have
been formed by accumulations of &s;and, earth, and
&s;hells, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively driven upon the coa&s;ts by
winds blowing from the &s;ea. For example, on
the we&s;t coa&s;ts of France, Spain, and Africa, a
violent we&s;t wind reigns, by which the waters
are pu&s;hed with violence again&s;t the &s;hores; and
downs, accordingly, are frequent on the&s;e coa&s;ts.
The ea&s;t winds, in the &s;ame manner, when they
continue long, drive the waters &s;o forcibly from
the coa&s;ts of Syria and Phoenicia, that large
chains of rocks, which are covered during the
we&s;t winds, are left dry. Be&s;ides, downs are
not compo&s;ed of &s;tones and marble, like the
mountains which have been formed in the bot|tom
of the ocean, becau&s;e they have not remain|ed
long enough under the waters. That the wa|ters
of the &s;ea po&s;&s;e&s;s a petrifying power, and that
<PB N="498" REF="533">
the &s;tones formed in the earth are very different
from tho&s;e formed at the bottom of the ocean,
is fully evinced in my di&s;cour&s;e on minerals.</P>
<P>Since fini&s;hing my theory of the earth, which
was compo&s;ed in the year 1744, I have peru&s;ed
M. Barrere's, di&s;&s;ertation on the origin of figu|red
&s;tones. It gave me peculiar &s;atisfaction to
find that the ideas of this accompli&s;hed naturali&s;t,
concerning the formation of downs, and the
duration of the &s;ea upon the &s;urface of the
earth which we inhabit, exactly corre&s;ponded
with my own. Aiguis-mortes, which is now
more than a league and a half from the &s;ea,
was a port in the time of St Louis. P&s;almodi
was an i&s;land in the 815; and it is now more
than two leagues from the &s;ea. The &s;ame change
has happened at Maguelone. The greate&s;t part
of the vineyard of Agde was covered, about 40
years ago, with the waters of the &s;ea. In Spain,
the &s;ea, within the&s;e few years, has retired con|&s;iderably
from Blanes, from Badalona, from the
environs of the river Vobregat, from Cape Tor|to&s;a
along the coa&s;t of Valencia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;ea may form hills and mountains in
different manners: 1. By tran&s;porting earth,
&s;lime, &s;and, and &s;hells from one place to another:
2. By depo&s;iting &s;ediments compo&s;ed of &s;mall
particles detached from the bottom and from the
coa&s;ts: And, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> hills and downs may be
formed by &s;and and other particles driven again&s;t
the coa&s;ts by particular winds; the&s;e are gradu|ally
de&s;erted by the &s;ea, and become parts of the
<PB N="499" REF="534">
dry land. The downs of Flanders and of Hol|land
are of this kind; they con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall cle|vations
or hills, compo&s;ed of &s;and and &s;hells,
which have been blown from the &s;ea upon the
coa&s;ts. M. Barrere gives another example, which
merits ob&s;ervation. 'The &s;ea,' he remarks, 'by its
motion, detaches immen&s;e quantities of plants,
&s;and, &s;hells and &s;lime from its bottom, which
are continually pu&s;hed by the winds and the
waves towards the coa&s;ts. The perpetual re|petition
of this operation mu&s;t give ri&s;e to gra|dual
accumulations of new &s;trata, which ele|vate
the earth, produce downs and hills, en|large
the land, and con&s;ine the &s;ea within nar|rower
bounds.'</P>
<P>'It is apparent that new &s;trata of different
materials mu&s;t have been formed by the con|&s;tant
attrition of the waters, by the depo&s;ition
of &s;ediments, and by other cau&s;es, the operation
of which has been co-eval with the exi&s;tence
of the globe it&s;elf. Of this we have a remark|able
proof in the different &s;trata of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells,
and other &s;ea bodies found at Rou&s;&s;illon near
the village of Naffiac, which is 7 or 8 leagues
from the &s;ea. The&s;e beds of &s;hells, which in|cline
at different angles from we&s;t to ea&s;t, are
divided from each other by &s;trata of earth and
&s;and, &s;ometimes of a foot and a half, and &s;ome|times
of two or three feet in thickne&s;s. In dry
weather they &s;eem as if &s;prinkled over with
&s;alt, and form a chain of hillocks from 25 to
<PB N="500" REF="535">
30 fathoms high. A long chain of hillocks of
&s;uch a height could not be formed at once,
but gradually, and by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time.
Effects &s;omewhat &s;imilar might have been pro|duced
by an univer&s;al deluge. But, in this
ca&s;e, the different beds of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, in&s;tead
of pre&s;erving a regular form, would have been
blended together without any order.'</P>
<P>I entirely agree with the &s;entiments of M.
Barrere, excepting as to the formation of moun|tains,
which cannot be &s;olely a&s;cribed to tho&s;e
cau&s;es which increa&s;e the land, and dimini&s;h the
boundaries of the ocean. On the contrary, I
think I can produce &s;everal convincing argu|ments
to prove, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e eminences,
which appear on the &s;urface of the earth, have
actually received their original formation in the
&s;ea it&s;elf: 1. Becau&s;e they have corre&s;ponding
angles, which nece&s;&s;arily imply the cau&s;e we
have a&s;&s;igned, namely, the motion of the cur|rents.
2. Becau&s;e downs and hills, which
have originated from materials thrown upon the
coa&s;ts, are not, like common hills, compo&s;ed of
marble and hard &s;tones. Be&s;ides, the &s;hells found
in the former, are only in the fo&s;&s;il &s;tate; where|as
tho&s;e in the latter are entirely petrified. Nei|ther
is the po&s;ition of the &s;trata equally hori|zontal
in downs, as in the hills compo&s;ed of
marble and hard &s;tone, but are more or le&s;s in|clined,
as in the hills of Naffiac. On the contrary,
in the hills and mountains formed by &s;ediments
<PB N="501" REF="536">
under the waters of the &s;ea, the &s;trata are always
parallel, and very often horizontal; and the
&s;hells and other matter of them are completely
petrified. I de&s;pair not of being able to prove,
that the marbles and other calcareous bodies,
which are almo&s;t all compo&s;ed of madrepores,
a&s;troites, and &s;hells, have acquired their den&s;ity
and perfection at the bottom of the ocean. But
the tufas, &s;oft &s;tones, incru&s;tations, &s;talactites,
&amp;c. which are likewi&s;e calcinable, and have been
formed &s;ince the earth was left dry, can never
acquire the degree of den&s;ity and of petrifaction
peculiar to marble and other hard &s;tones.</P>
<P>The remarks of M. Saulmon, concerning the
<HI>galets,</HI> which are found in many places, may be
&s;een in the hi&s;tory of the French Academy, <HI>an|no</HI>
1707. The&s;e <HI>galets</HI> are round, flat, finely
poli&s;hed pieces of flint, thrown out by the &s;ea
upon the coa&s;ts. At Bayeux, and at Prutel,
which is a league from the &s;ea, galets are found
in digging pits and wells. The mountains of
Bonneuil, of Broie, and of Que&s;noy, which are
18 leagues di&s;tant from the &s;ea, are covered with
galets. They are al&s;o found in the valley of
Clermont in Beauvois. M. Saulmon farther
informs us, that a hole, 16 feet in length, was
pierced horizontally into the high beach of Tre&s;|port,
which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;oft earth; and that,
in the &s;pace of 30 years, it was entirely oblite|rated
by the &s;ea. Suppo&s;ing the &s;ea to encroach
<PB N="502" REF="537">
uniformly upon this &s;hore, it will gain half a
league in 12000 years.</P>
<P>The motions of the &s;ea, therefore, mu&s;t be
regarded as the principal cau&s;e of all tho&s;e chan|ges
which have already happened, and of tho&s;e
which are daily produced upon the &s;urface of
the earth. But there are other cau&s;es, which,
though le&s;s con&s;iderable, have &s;ome effect in
changing the &s;uperficial parts of this globe. The
rivers, the brooks, the melting of &s;nows, the tor|rents,
the fro&s;ts, &amp;c. have given ri&s;e to many
alterations. The rains have dimini&s;hed the
height of the mountains; the rivers and brooks
have elevated the plains, and dammed up the &s;ea
at their mouths; the torrents and the melting
of &s;nows have &s;cooped out deep ravines or fur|rows
in the vallies and narrow pa&s;&s;ages between
the mountains; the fro&s;ts have &s;plit rocks, and
detached them from their original &s;tations: In|numerable
examples of revolutions produced by
all the&s;e cau&s;es might be given. Varenius tells
us, that the rivers tran&s;port into the &s;ea va&s;t
quantities of earth, and depo&s;ite them at greater
or le&s;&s;er di&s;tances from the &s;hore, in proportion
to the rapidity of their currents. The&s;e portions
of earth fall to the bottom, and fir&s;t form &s;mall
banks, which, by con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ions, become
&s;hoals, and at la&s;t appear in the form of fertile
and habitable i&s;lands. It is in this manner that
the i&s;lands in the Nile, tho&s;e in the river St
Lawrence, the i&s;land of Landa, &s;ituated near the
<PB N="503" REF="538">
mouth of the river Coanza, on the coa&s;t of A|frica,
the Norwegian i&s;lands, &amp;c. have received
their exi&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Varen. Geogr. p. 214.</NOTE>. To the&s;e may be added the
i&s;land of Trong-ming in China, which has been
gradually formed by matters brought down by
the river Nankin, and depo&s;ited near its mouth.
This i&s;land is more than 20 leagues in length,
and from 5 to 6 in breadth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Lettres edifiant. rec. 11. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Po, the Trento, and other rivers of Italy,
bring down &s;uch quantities of earth into the
<HI>lagunes</HI> of Venice, e&s;pecially in the time of
inundations, that they mu&s;t be gradually filled
up. Many parts of them are already dry during
the ebb tide; and there is in them no depth of
water, excepting in the canals, which are &s;up|ported
at an immen&s;e expence.</P>
<P>Large &s;and-banks are thrown up at the
mouths of the Nile, of the Ganges, of the In|dus,
of the Plata, and of many other rivers.
La Loubere, in his voyage to Siam, informs us,
that the banks of &s;and and of earth augment
daily, at the mouths of the great rivers of A&s;ia,
to &s;uch a degree that the navigation of them
becomes every hour more difficult, and will &s;oon
be impracticable. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies
to the great rivers of Europe, and e&s;pecially to
the Wolga, which empties it&s;elf by more than
70 mouths into the Ca&s;pian, and to the Danube,
which runs into the Black Sea by &s;even mouths,
&amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="539">
As it &s;eldom rains in Egypt, the regular in|undations
of the Nile proceed from the torrents
which fall into it from Aethiopia. It brings down
va&s;t quantities of mud, which it depo&s;ites annu|ally
not only upon the &s;oil of Egypt, but
throws it to great di&s;tances into the &s;ea, where it
is laying the foundations of a new country,
which mu&s;t ari&s;e, in the cour&s;e of time, out of
the bo&s;om of the ocean; for, upon &s;ounding at
the di&s;tance of 20 leagues from the coa&s;t, the
mud of the Nile is found at the bottom of the
&s;ea; and every year it receives fre&s;h accumula|tions.
The Lower Egypt, now called the <HI>Delta,</HI>
was formerly a bay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Diodor. Sic. lib. 3. Ari&s;tot. de Meteor. lib, 1. cap. 14. Herodot. &sect; 4. 5. &amp;c.</NOTE> Homer tells us, that the
i&s;land of Pharos was a day and a night's voyage
from Egypt; and now it is almo&s;t contiguous
to the land. The &s;oil of Egypt is not every
where of an equal depth; it grows thinner the
nearer we approach the &s;ea. Near the banks
of the Nile, there are &s;ometimes more than 30
feet of good &s;oil; but, at the end of the inun|dation,
there remain not, perhaps, above 7 inches.
All the cities of the Lower Egypt have been
built upon artificial eminences<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE> The town of
Damietta, which is now ten miles from the &s;ea,
was a part of the ocean in the year 1243. The
town of Fooah, which, 300 years ago, was &s;itu|ated
at the mouth of the Canopic branch of the
Nile, is now 7 miles di&s;tant from it. Within

<P>Many changes have al&s;o taken place at the
mouths of the great rivers of America, and even in
tho&s;e which have been but lately di&s;covered. Char|levoix
tells us, that, at the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi,
below New Orleans, the land runs out in|to
a point, which appears not to be very antient;
becau&s;e, wherever the earth is dug, plenty of
water is found; and be&s;ides, the many little
i&s;lands which have recently appeared in all the
mouths of this river, leave no room to doubt
but that this point of land was formed in the
&s;ame manner. It is certain, &s;ays he, that, when
M. Salle &s;ailed down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to the &s;ea,
the mouth of this river was con&s;iderably dif|ferent
from what it now appears.</P>
<P>The nearer, he adds, we approach the &s;ea,
this difference becomes the more con&s;picuous.
There is no water in mo&s;t of the &s;mall channels
cut in the bar by the river. The&s;e channels
are greatly multiplied by the trees brought down
by the current. A &s;ingle tree, with its branches
and roots, when &s;topped in a &s;hallow part of the
river, will entangle a thou&s;and. I have &s;een,
&s;ays he, 200 leagues from New Orleans, collec|tions
of trees, any one of which would &s;ill all
the wood-yards in Paris. Nothing can di&s;en|tangle
them. The mud brought down by the
river &s;erves as a cement to them, and gradually
<PB N="506" REF="541">
covers them. Every inundation leaves a new
&s;tratum; and, in a few years, plants and &s;hrubs
begin to grow. It is in this manner that mo&s;t
points of land and i&s;lands, which &s;o often change
the cour&s;e of rivers, are originally produced.</P>
<P>All the revolutions, however, brought about
by rivers, are very &s;low, and become not con&s;i|derable
till after a long cour&s;e of years. But
tho&s;e which are occa&s;ioned by inundations or
earthquakes are &s;udden, and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous.
According to the Timacus of Plato, we are a&s;|&s;ured
by the antient prie&s;ts of Egypt, 600 years
before the birth of Chri&s;t, that there exi&s;ted an
i&s;land beyond the Pillars of Hercules, called
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> which was larger than both A&s;ia and
Lybia taken together; and that this great i&s;land
was &s;unk under the waters of the ocean by a

<HI>Plato in Timaeo.</HI> This antient tra|dition
is not devoid of probability. The lands
&s;wallowed up by the waters were, perhaps, tho&s;e
which united Ireland to the Azores, and the
Azores to the continent of America; for, in
Ireland, there are the &s;ame fo&s;&s;ils, the &s;ame &s;hells,
and the &s;ame &s;ea-bodies, as appear in America,
and &s;ome of them are found in no other part of
Europe.</P>
<P>Two evidences are mentioned by Eu&s;ebius on
the &s;ubject of deluges: The one is Melo, who
affirms, that all the plains of Syria were former|ly
laid under water: The other is Abidenus,
who &s;ays, that, in the reign of King Si&s;ithrus,
there was a great deluge, which had been pre|dicted
by Saturn. Plutarch <HI>De Solertia Anima|lium,</HI>
Ovid, and other mythologi&s;ts, de&s;cribe the
deluge of Deucalion, which happened, they &s;ay,
in The&s;&s;aly, about 700 years after the univer&s;al
deluge. It is al&s;o alledged, that there was a
&s;till more antient deluge in Attica, during the
time of Ogiges, about 230 years before that of
Deucalion. In the year 1095, a deluge in Syria
drowned a prodigious number of people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Al&s;ted, Chron. chap. 25.</NOTE>. In
1164, a deluge in Frie&s;land covered the whole
environs of the coa&s;ts, and drowned &s;everal
thou&s;ands of the inhabitants<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Krank, lib. 5. c. 4.</NOTE>.
Another inun|dation,
<PB N="508" REF="543">
in 1218, de&s;troyed 100,000 men. Of
inundations there are many other examples, as
that which happened in England in the year
1604, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Impetuous winds may be regarded as a third
cau&s;e of changes on the &s;urface of the globe.
They not only give ri&s;e to downs and hills along
the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, but they often arre&s;t rivers, make
them regorge, and change their directions. They
carry off cultivated lands, tear up trees, overturn
hou&s;es, and cover whole countries with &s;and.
Upon the coa&s;t of Britany, in France, we have
an example of tho&s;e inundations of &s;and: The
hi&s;tory of the Academy, ann. 1722, de&s;cribes it
in the following terms:</P>
<P>'In the environs of St Paul de Leon, in
Lower Britany, there is a province on the &s;ea|coa&s;t,
which, before the year 1666, was inha|bited;
but is now totally de&s;erted, on account
of the &s;and, which has covered it to the depth
of 20 feet, and which daily gains ground.
Reckoning from the above period, the &s;and
has advanced about 6 leagues into the country;
and it is now within half a league of St Paul,
and that town mu&s;t probably &s;oon be de&s;erted,
The tops of &s;teeples, and of &s;ome chimnies,
&s;till appear above this ocean of &s;and. The
inhabitants, however, have always had lei&s;ure
to quit their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in &s;afety; p. 7.'</P>
<P>'This calamity is augmented by an ea&s;t, or a
north wind, which elevate this fine &s;and, and
<PB N="509" REF="544">
carry it in &s;uch quantities, and with &s;uch ra|pidity,
that M. De&s;landes, to whom the Aca|demy
are indebted for the ob&s;ervation, when
walking in this country during an ea&s;t wind,
found him&s;elf obliged to &s;hake his hat and his
garments from time to time, on account of the
great weight of &s;and with which they were
loaded. Be&s;ides, when the wind is violent, it
carries the &s;and over a &s;mall arm of the &s;ea as
far as Ro&s;cof, a port much frequented by fo|reign
ve&s;&s;els; and the &s;and accumulates in the
&s;treets of this villages to the height of two feet,
which obliges the inhabitants to drive it off in
waggons. It may be further remarked, that
the &s;and is mixed with ferruginous particles,
which are recogni&s;able by the magnet.'</P>
<P>'The coa&s;t which furni&s;hes this &s;and extends
from St Paul to Plouefcat, a &s;pace of more than
four leagues; and it is nearly on a level with
the &s;ea when the tide is full. It is &s;ituated in
&s;uch a manner that only the ea&s;t and north|ea&s;t
winds can blow the &s;and in upon the
country. It is ea&s;y to conceive how &s;and car|ried
and accumulated into any place by the
wind, may again be taken up by the &s;ame
wind, and carried &s;till farther. Thus the &s;and
may continue advancing, and covering new
lands, as long as the magazine from which it
originally proceeds &s;hall remain unexhau&s;ted;
for, if the fountain were once dried up, the
&s;and, by advancing, would dimini&s;h in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="510" REF="545">
and its de&s;tructive con&s;equences would gradu|ally
decay. But it is not improbable that the
&s;ea may long continue to &s;upply fre&s;h &s;and,
and keep this baneful magazine in a condition
to do perpetual mi&s;chief.'</P>
<P>'This di&s;a&s;ter is not of an old date. Perhaps
it was not till lately that the place was &s;uffi|ciently
&s;tored to allow great quantities of &s;and
to be carried off; or, perhaps, it has but re|cently
been left uncovered by the waters.
This coa&s;t has undergone &s;ome change. At
pre&s;ent, the &s;ea, at full tide, reaches half a
league on this &s;ide of certain rocks, which it
formerly never pa&s;&s;ed.'</P>
<P>'This mi&s;erable province ju&s;tifies what has
been related, both by antient and by modern
travellers, that whole cities, and even va&s;t
armies, have been buried by tempe&s;ts of &s;and
in the de&s;arts of Arabia.'</P>
<P>Mr Shaw relates, that the ports of Laodicea,
Torto&s;a, Rowad&s;a, Tripoly, Tyre, Acra, and
Jaffa, are blocked up with &s;and tran&s;ported by
the high waves which ri&s;e on that part of the
coa&s;t, when the we&s;t winds blow with vio|lence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to give more examples of alte|rations
on the &s;urface of this globe. The fire,
the air, and the waters, produce continual
changes, which, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, become
con&s;iderable. The &s;ea and the land not only
<PB N="511" REF="546">
change places from the effects of general and
&s;tated periodic laws, but a number of revolu|tions
are brought about by particular and acci|dental
cau&s;es, as earthquakes, inundations, &s;ink|ings
of mountains, &amp;c. Thus the &s;urface of the
earth, which we regard as the mo&s;t permanent
of all things, is &s;ubjected, like the re&s;t of nature,
to perpetual vici&s;&s;itudes.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the proofs delivered in Art. VII.
and VIII. it appears to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed
fact, that the whole &s;urface of what is now dry
land, was formerly buried under the waters of
the ocean. It is equally clear, from Art. XII.
that the flux and reflux, and other movements
of the ocean, perpetually detach from the coa&s;ts
and from the bottom of the &s;ea, &s;hells, and mat|ter
of every &s;pecies; and that the&s;e are depo&s;ited
in other places in the form of &s;ediments, and
give ri&s;e to the horizontal &s;trata which every
where appear. In the IX. art. we have proved,
that the inequalities on the &s;urface of the globe
have been occa&s;ioned by the motion of the waters
of the &s;ea; and that the mountains received their
original formation from &s;ucce&s;&s;ive accumulations
of the &s;ediments above de&s;cribed. It is likewi&s;e
evident, from Art. XIII. that the currents which
fir&s;t followed the direction of the&s;e inequalities,
afterwards be&s;towed on them their pre&s;ent fi|gure,
that is, their alternate and corre&s;ponding
angles. From Art. VIII. and XVIII. it appears,
that mo&s;t of the matters detached from the coa&s;ts
and from the bottom of the &s;ea were, when de|po&s;ited
in &s;ediments, in the form of a fine im|palpable
<PB N="513" REF="548">
powder, which entirely filled the cavi|ties
of &s;hells, whether this powder was of the
&s;ame nature, or only analogous to the matter of
which the &s;hells were compo&s;ed. It is unde|niable,
from Art. XVII. that the horizontal &s;tra|ta,
which have been formed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive accu|mulations
of &s;ediments, and which at fir&s;t were
&s;oft and ductile, acquired den&s;ity and compact|ne&s;s
in proportion as they dried; and that the
perpendicular fi&s;&s;ures in the &s;trata derived their
origin from the act of drying.</P>
<P>After peru&s;ing Art. X. XI. XIV. XV. XVI.
XVII. XVIII. and XIX. we mu&s;t be convinced,
that the &s;urface of the earth has been disfigured
by many revolutions and particular vici&s;&s;itudes,
ari&s;ing from the operation of the waters, and the
effects of rains, fro&s;t, rivers, winds, &s;ubterraneous
fires, earthquakes, inundations, &amp;c. and, con&s;e|quently,
that the &s;ea has alternately changed
places with the dry land, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t
ages after the creation, when terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tan|ces
were much &s;ofter than they are at pre&s;ent.
It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledged, that our
judgment concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of natural
revolutions cannot fail to be very imperfect; that
we are &s;till le&s;s competent judges of tho&s;e changes
which owe their birth to fortuitous events; and,
that the defect of hi&s;toric records deprives us of
the knowledge of particular facts. We de&s;iderate
both time and experience. We never con&s;ider,
that, though our exi&s;tence here be extremely li|mited,
<PB N="514" REF="549">
nature proceeds in her cour&s;e. We are
ambitious of conden&s;ing into our momentary
duration both the pa&s;t and the future, without
reflecting that human life is only a point of time,
a &s;ingle fact in the hi&s;tory of the operations of
the Almighty.</P>
