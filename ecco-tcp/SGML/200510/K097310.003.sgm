<P>AS the Natural Hi&s;tory of Quadrupeds com|mences in this Volume, the Tran&s;lator thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to mention a few circum&s;tan|ces, which, to &s;ome readers, might have the ap|pearance of not clo&s;ely following the original.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of dome&s;tic animals, the COUNT DE BUFFON has not given the SYNONYMA of authors. The &s;ame omi&s;&s;ion &s;ometimes happens in his account of wild animals. In all the&s;e in|&s;tances, the Tran&s;lator has added the SYNONY|MA from other &s;ources of information.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance mu&s;t be noticed. Many articles of the original work were publi&s;hed near thirty years ago. The COUNT DE BUFFON quoted from the editions of books which were at that time the la&s;t. But, as many of the&s;e books have &s;ince undergone different impre&s;&s;ions, and the authors have made con&s;iderable amendments in their definitions, and even in their &s;y&s;tematic ar|rangements, the Tran&s;lator, in ju&s;tice to the&s;e Naturali&s;ts, has referred to the pa&s;&s;ages and pa|ges as they appear in the corrected editions. Hence the references in the tran&s;lation frequent|ly corre&s;pond not with tho&s;e of the original. For <PB REF="3"> the &s;ame rea&s;on, &s;everal &s;trictures upon the wri|tings of Sir Charles Linnaeus, and others, could not be in&s;erted with any degree of propriety; becau&s;e many of the inaccuracies, which the COUNT reprehends, have now no exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>WE have already de&s;cribed the parts of which the human body con&s;i&s;ts; and &s;hall now proceed to examine tho&s;e curious or|gans by which &s;en&s;ations are conveyed to the mind. In this inve&s;tigation, we &s;hall endeavour to point out the u&s;es of the different &s;en&s;es, and to mark tho&s;e errors to which we are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;ubjected by Nature.</P>
<P>In the human foetus, the eyes are early form|ed; in the chicken al&s;o, they are the fir&s;t double organs which make their appearance; and, in the eggs of lizards, and of &s;everal &s;pecies of birds, I have remarked, that the eyes were more pro|minent and advanced in growth than any other double parts of the body. In viviparous ani|mals, it is true, and particularly in the human foetus, the eyes are not &s;o large, in proportion, <PB N="2" REF="7"> as in the oviparous; but &s;till they are more quickly expanded than the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. The &s;ame remark applies to the organ of hearing. The &s;mall bones of the ear are ful|ly formed before the other bones of the body have acquired any degree of &s;olidity or bulk. In the &s;eventh month, the whole bones of the ear are perfectly &s;olid, and have acquired all the den&s;ity they po&s;&s;e&s;s in the adult &s;tate. It is, therefore, apparent, that tho&s;e parts which are furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t quantity of nerves, are fir&s;t formed and expanded. We formerly remarked, that the ve&s;icles which contain the brain and cerebellum, and that which contains the &s;pinal marrow, appear fir&s;t. The &s;pinal marrow is a fundamental and e&s;&s;ential part of the body, and is therefore fir&s;t formed. Hence the nerves exi&s;t before any of the other parts of the body, and tho&s;e organs which are mo&s;t amply &s;upplied with them, as the ears and eyes, are mo&s;t quickly expanded.</P>
<P>Upon examining the eyes of an infant &s;ome hours after birth, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that it can make no u&s;e of them: This organ not ha|ving acquired a &s;ufficient degree of con&s;i&s;tence, the rays of light make only a confu&s;ed impre&s;&s;ion on the retina. About a month after birth, the eye &s;eems to have acquired that ten&s;ion and &s;o|lidity which are nece&s;&s;ary for the proper tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of the rays of light; but, even then, in|fants are incapable of fixing their eyes upon any <PB N="3" REF="8"> object: They roll and move them to all &s;ides, without being able to di&s;tingui&s;h the objects to which their eyes are directed. In &s;ix or &s;even weeks, however, they begin to fix their atten|tion upon luminous objects. But this exerci&s;e only tends to fortify the eye, without convey|ing any exact perception of different objects; for the fir&s;t great error in vi&s;ion, is the inverted repre&s;entation of objects upon the retina: And, till children learn the real po&s;ition of bodies by the &s;en&s;e of feeling, they &s;ee every object in|verted. A &s;econd error in the vi&s;ion of infants ari&s;es from the double appearance of objects; becau&s;e a di&s;tinct image of the &s;ame object is formed on the retina of each eye. It is only by the experience of feeling bodies, that children are enabled to correct this error; by the fre|quent handling of objects, they gradually learn that they are neither double nor inverted; and cu&s;tom &s;oon makes them imagine they &s;ee ob|jects in the order and po&s;ition in which they are repre&s;ented to the mind by the &s;en&s;e of touch|ing. Hence, if we were deprived of feeling, our eyes would deceive us, both with regard to the po&s;ition and number of objects.</P>
<P>The inver&s;ion of objects is a re&s;ult of the &s;tructure of the eye; for the rays which form the-images of the&s;e objects, cannot enter the pu|pil without cro&s;&s;ing each other. This admits of an ea&s;y proof: When light is tran&s;mitted through <PB N="4" REF="9"> a &s;mall hole into a dark chamber, the images of the objects from without are repre&s;ented on the wall in an inverted po&s;ition; becau&s;e all the rays reflected from the different points of the object cannot pa&s;s through this &s;mall hole, in the &s;ame extent and po&s;ition as they pro|ceed from the object, unle&s;s the hole be of equal dimen&s;ions with the object. But, as every part of the object reflects images of it&s;elf on all &s;ides, and, as the rays which form the&s;e i|mages proceed from every point of the object, as from &s;o many centres, none of them can pa&s;s through the hole but tho&s;e that arrive at it in different directions. Hence the hole becomes the centre of the whole object, at which the rays flowing from the lower, as well as the higher parts of the object, arrive in converging direc|tions; and, of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t cro&s;s each other at this centre, and repre&s;ent the picture of the object on the oppo&s;ite wall in an inverted po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is equally ea&s;y to &s;how that we &s;ee all ob|jects double: If, for in&s;tance, we look at an object with the right eye, we will find that it corre&s;ponds with a certain point of the wall; if we look at the &s;ame object with the left, it then corre&s;ponds with a different point; and, la&s;tly, when we look at it with both eyes, it appears in the middle between the&s;e points. Thus an i|mage of the object is formed on both eyes, one of which appears on the left and the other on <PB N="5" REF="10"> the right; and we perceive it to be &s;ingle and in a middle &s;ituation, becau&s;e we have learned to correct this error of vi&s;ion by the &s;en&s;e of touch|ing. In the &s;ame manner, if we look with both eyes at two objects, nearly in the &s;ame direc|tion, by fixing our eyes on the neare&s;t, we per|ceive it to be &s;ingle; but the farthe&s;t appears to be double; and, if we fix our eyes on the far|the&s;t, it appears to be &s;ingle, while the neare&s;t is perceived to be double. This is an evident proof, that we &s;ee all objects double, though we conceive them to be &s;ingle; and that, though we form an accurate idea of their real &s;ituation, yet we actually &s;ee them where they are not. If, therefore, the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing were not con|&s;tantly rectified by that of touching, we would be perpetually deceived as to the po&s;ition, num|ber, and &s;ituation of objects; we would perceive them to be inverted, double, and to the right or left of their real &s;ituations; and, in&s;tead of two, if we had 100 eyes, we would &s;till conceive ob|jects to be &s;ingle, though they were in reality multiplied a hundred fold.</P>
<P>Thus a &s;eparate image of every object is form|ed in each eye; and, when the two images fall on corre&s;ponding parts of the retina, or tho&s;e parts which are always affected at the &s;ame time, objects appear &s;ingle, becau&s;e we are accu&s;tomed to judge of them in this manner. But, when the images of objects fall upon parts of the re|tina which are not u&s;ually affected at the &s;ame <PB N="6" REF="11"> time, they then appear double, becau&s;e we have not acquired the habit of rectifying this unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mr Che&s;&s;elden, in his anatomy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 324.</NOTE>, relates the ca&s;e of a man who had been affected with a &s;trabi&s;mus, in con&s;equence of a blow on the head. This man &s;aw every object double for a long time. But he gradually learned to correct this error of vi&s;ion, with regard to objects which were mo&s;t familiar to him; and, at la&s;t, he &s;aw every object &s;ingle as formerly, though the &s;quinting of his eyes was never removed. This is a proof &s;till more direct, that we really &s;ee all objects double, and that it is by habit alone we learn to conceive them to be &s;ingle. If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, why children &s;ooner acquire the facul|ty of correcting this deception than adults who&s;e eyes have been di&s;torted by accident? it may be replied, that children, having acquired no op|po&s;ite habits, le&s;s time is, of cour&s;e, nece&s;&s;ary to correct the errors of their &s;en&s;ations; but that adults, who have for many years been accu&s;tom|ed to perceive objects &s;ingle, becau&s;e their ima|ges fall upon corre&s;ponding parts of the retina, have a contrary habit to oppo&s;e, and, con&s;e|quently, mu&s;t require a long time before they can efface all the traces of it.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing conveys no idea of di|&s;tances. Without the aid of touching, all objects would appear to be within the eye, becau&s;e it is <PB N="7" REF="12"> there alone that their images exi&s;t: And an in|fant, who has had no experience of the &s;en&s;e of touching, mu&s;t con&s;ider all external bodies as exi&s;ting in it&s;elf: They only appear larger or &s;maller, according as they approach or recede from the eye. A fly, when near the eye, will &s;eem larger than an ox or a hor&s;e at a di&s;tance. Thus an infant can have no idea of the relative magnitude of objects, becau&s;e he has no notion of the different di&s;tances at which he views them. It is only after mea&s;uring &s;pace by the exten&s;ion of the hand, or by tran&s;porting their bodies from one place to another, that children acquire ideas concerning the di&s;tances and magnitudes of ob|jects. Before this period, they can form no judgment of the di&s;tance or magnitude of an ob|ject, but by the image painted on the retina. Their ideas of magnitude entirely re&s;ult from the angle formed by the extreme rays reflected from the &s;uperior and inferior part of the object: Of cour&s;e, every near object mu&s;t appear to be large, and every di&s;tant object &s;mall. But, after having acquired, by touch, ideas of di&s;tances, the judgment concerning magnitude begins to be rectified: They tru&s;t not alone to the appa|rent magnitude conveyed by the eye: They en|deavour to inve&s;tigate the di&s;tance; they try, at the &s;ame time, to di&s;tingui&s;h the object by its form; and then they judge of its magnitude.</P>
<P>If we judge by the eye alone, and have not acquired the habit of apprehending the &s;ame ob|jects <PB N="8" REF="13"> to be equally large, though viewed at dif|ferent di&s;tances, the fir&s;t &s;oldiers, in a file of 20, mu&s;t appear much larger than the la&s;t. But we know the la&s;t &s;oldier to be equally large with the fir&s;t; and hence we judge him to be of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions. And, as we have the habit of con|&s;idering the &s;ame object to be of equal magni|tude at all ordinary di&s;tances, we are never de|ceived on this head, excepting when the di&s;tance is too great, or when the interval is in an uncom|mon direction. A di&s;tance cea&s;es to be familiar to us whenever it is too large, or rather when the interval is vertical in&s;tead of horizontal. The fir&s;t ideas of the comparative magnitude of objects we acquire either by mea&s;uring their re|lative di&s;tances by the hand, or by moving the whole body. But all the experiments by which we commonly rectify the errors of vi&s;ion, with regard to di&s;tances, are made horizontally. We have no acquired habit of judging of the mag|nitude of objects which are elevated above, or &s;unk below us; becau&s;e we are not accu&s;tomed to mea&s;ure in this direction by the touch. Hence, when viewing men from the top of a tower, or when looking up to a cock or a globe on the top of a &s;teeple, we think the&s;e objects are much more dimini&s;hed, than if we viewed them at equal di&s;tances in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>Though a &s;mall degree of reflection be &s;uffi|cient to convince us of the truth of the&s;e po&s;i|tions, it may &s;till be of u&s;e to relate the facts <PB N="9" REF="14"> which confirm them. The celebrated Che&s;&s;el|den couched cataracts in both eyes of a lad of 13 years of age, who had been blind from his birth. The operation &s;ucceeded; and Mr Che&s;&s;el|den carefully ob&s;erved the manner in which the young man was affected by the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing. The&s;e ob&s;ervations he publi&s;hed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Phil. Tran&s;. No. 402. and Tatler, Art. 55.</NOTE>. This young man was not ab&s;olutely blind: Like other per&s;ons affected with cataracts, he could di&s;tingui&s;h night from day, and even black from white; but he had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant conception of the fi|gure of bodies. The operation was fir&s;t per|formed on one eye. When he &s;aw for the fir&s;t time, he was &s;o far from judging of di&s;tances, that he believed every object touched his eyes, in the &s;ame manner as every thing he handled touched his &s;kin. Objects of a regular figure, and having plain &s;urfaces, were mo&s;t agreeable to him, though he was &s;till incapable of form|ing any judgment as to their form, or telling why they afforded him more plea&s;ure than o|thers. His ideas of colours, before the opera|tion, were &s;o faint, that, after receiving his &s;ight, he was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h one from another. He in&s;i&s;ted that the colours which he then &s;aw were not the &s;ame he was formerly acquainted with. He knew not the figure of any object; nor could he di&s;tingui&s;h one from another, however different in form and in magnitude. <PB N="10" REF="15"> When pre&s;ented with things which were for|merly familiar to him, he ob&s;erved them with attention, that he might be able to know them afterwards. But, as he had too many objects to recogni&s;e at once, he forgot the greate&s;t part of them; and, from his commencing to di&s;tin|gui&s;h objects, he did not retain in his memory one out of a thou&s;and. Tho&s;e objects and per|&s;ons which were formerly mo&s;t beloved by him, he was a&s;toni&s;hed to find that they were not al&s;o the mo&s;t agreeable to his &s;ight. It was more than two months before he could perceive that pic|tures were the repre&s;entations of &s;olid bodies. Previous to this period, he con&s;idered them on|ly as plain &s;urfaces diver&s;ified by different co|lours. But, after he began to perceive that pic|tures repre&s;ented &s;olid bodies, he expected to recogni&s;e their &s;eeming inequalities by touching the canvas; and was perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed when he found the whole uniformly &s;mooth. He a&s;ked, whether the deception aro&s;e from the &s;en&s;e of feeling or that of &s;eeing? He was then &s;hown a miniature portrait of his father, contained in his mother's watch-ca&s;e. He recogni&s;ed the re|&s;emblance of his father: But he inquired with amazement how &s;o large a countenance could po&s;&s;ibly be contained in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s; for it appeared to him equally &s;trange, as that a bu&s;hel &s;hould be held in a pint ve&s;&s;el. At fir&s;t, his eye could &s;upport only a &s;mall quantity of light; and every object &s;eemed much larger <PB N="11" REF="16"> than the life. But, after he had &s;een objects of large dimen&s;ions, former objects appeared to be proportionally dimini&s;hed. He had no con|ception that any object exceeded the limits of tho&s;e he had already &s;een. He knew that his own apartment was only a part of the hou&s;e, and yet he was unable to comprehend how the hou&s;e &s;hould be larger than his chamber. Be|fore the operation, he expected not much plea|&s;ure from the acqui&s;ition of the new &s;en&s;e that had been promi&s;ed him, excepting what &s;hould ari&s;e from his being enabled to read and write. He alledged, for example, that he could receive no new &s;atisfaction from walking in the garden, becau&s;e he already knew every corner of it, and could walk there with great ea&s;e and free|dom. He had even remarked, that his blind|ne&s;s gave him the advantage of walking in the night with more confidence and &s;ecurity than tho&s;e who enjoyed the benefit of &s;ight. But, after he began to have the proper u&s;e of this new &s;en&s;e, he was tran&s;ported beyond mea&s;re. He declared that every new object afforded, a fre&s;h delight; and that the plea&s;ure he felt ex|ceeded the powers of expre&s;&s;ion. About twelve months after the operation, he was conducted to Ep&s;om, from which there is a beautiful and ex|ten&s;ive pro&s;pect. He was charmed with the view; and he called this land&s;cape a new mode of &s;eeing.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17"> About a year after the fir&s;t operation, the ca|taract on the other eye was couched with equal &s;ucce&s;s. With this &s;econd eye he perceived ob|jects to be much larger than with the other, but not &s;o large as when he fir&s;t received &s;ight; and, when he viewed the &s;ame object with both eyes, he &s;aid that it appeared to be twice as large as with the fir&s;t eye alone. But, after he procured the u&s;e of both eyes, he did not &s;ee objects double, or, at lea&s;t, Mr Che&s;&s;elden could not be certain that he did.</P>
<P>Mr Che&s;&s;elden records &s;everal other examples of blind men, who had no remembrance of light, re&s;tored to vi&s;ion by the &s;ame operation; and he a&s;&s;ures us, that, when they fir&s;t obtained the u&s;e of their eyes, they expre&s;&s;ed their percep|tions in a &s;imilar manner, though not &s;o minutely: And he remarks, upon the whole, that as, du|ring their blindne&s;s, they had no occa&s;ion to move their eyes, it co&s;t them much difficulty and a con&s;iderable time, before they could ac|quire the faculty of directing them to the objects they wi&s;hed to examine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lettre &s;ur les aveugles, &agrave; l'u&s;age de ceux qui voient.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As, from particular circum&s;tances, we can have no ju&s;t idea of di&s;tance, and, as we cannot judge concerning the magnitude of objects, but by the largene&s;s of the angle or image formed in the eye, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be liable to de|ceptions with regard to the&s;e articles. Every body knows how liable we are, when travelling in the night, to mi&s;take a bu&s;h that is near us <PB N="13" REF="18"> for a tree at a di&s;tance, or a di&s;tant tree for a bu&s;h which is at hand. In the &s;ame manner, if we are unacquainted with the figure of ob|jects, we cannot form any idea, either of their di&s;tance or magnitude: A fly pa&s;&s;ing with rapi|dity at &s;ome inches from the eye, would, in this ca&s;e, appear like a bird at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and a hor&s;e, &s;tanding in the middle of a plain, would not &s;eem larger than a &s;heep. But, as &s;oon as we knew it to be a hor&s;e, it would in|&s;tantly appear as large as the life, becau&s;e we have the power of correcting the deception of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whenever, therefore, we are benighted in a part of the country with which we are unac|quainted, being unable, on account of the dark|ne&s;s, to judge of the di&s;tance or figure of ob|jects, we are every moment liable to all the de|ceptions of vi&s;ion. This is the &s;ource of that dread which mo&s;t feel in the dark, and of tho&s;e &s;pectres and terrible figures which &s;o many per|&s;ons tell us they have &s;een in the night. Though &s;uch figures, it is commonly a&s;&s;erted, exi&s;t only in the imagination; yet they may have a real exi&s;tence in the eye; for, whenever we have no other mode of judging of an unknown ob|ject but by the angle it forms in the eye, its magnitude will uniformly increa&s;e in proportion to its propinquity. If it appears, when at the di&s;tance of 20 or 30 paces, to be only a few feet high, its height, when within two or three <PB N="14" REF="19"> feet of the eye, will be many fathoms. An, ob|ject of this kind mu&s;t naturally excite terror and a&s;toni&s;hment in the &s;pectator, till he approaches and recogni&s;es it by actual feeling; for the mo|ment a man knows an object, the gigantic ap|pearance it a&s;&s;umed in the eye in&s;tantly dimi|ni&s;hes, and its apparent magnitude is reduced to its real dimen&s;ions. But if, in&s;tead of approach|ing &s;uch an object, the &s;pectator flies from it, he can have no other idea of it, but from the image which it formed in his eye; and, in this ca&s;e, he may affirm with truth, that he &s;aw an object terrible in its a&s;pect, and enormous in its &s;ize. Thus the notions concerning &s;pectres is founded in nature, and depend not, as &s;ome philo&s;ophers affirm, upon the imagination alone.</P>
<P>When we are unable to form an idea of the di&s;tance of objects by a knowledge of the &s;pace between them and the eye, we endeavour to judge of their magnitude by di&s;tingui&s;hing their figures. But, when the figures are not di&s;tin|gui&s;hable, and when we view a number of ob|jects of the &s;ame form, we conceive tho&s;e that are mo&s;t brilliant to be neare&s;t, and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t ob&s;cure to be at the greate&s;t di&s;tance. This mode of judging gives ri&s;e to deceptions of a &s;ingular nature. When a multitude of objects are di&s;po&s;ed in a right line, as the lamps on the road from Ver&s;ailles to Paris, of the proximity or remotene&s;s of which we can only judge by the different quantities of light they tran&s;mit to the <PB N="15" REF="20"> eye, it frequently happens, when viewed at the di&s;tance of an eighth of a league, that the lamps appear to be on the right hand, in place of the left. This deception is an effect of the cau&s;e above mentioned; for, as the &s;pectator has no other criterion to judge of the di&s;tance of the lamps, but the quantity of light they emit, he thinks the mo&s;t brilliant of them is neare&s;t to his eye. Now, if the fir&s;t two or three lamps &s;hould happen to be mo&s;t ob&s;cure, or, if one in the whole range was more brillant than the re&s;t, that one, to a &s;pectator, would &s;eem to be the fir&s;t, and all the others, whatever might be their real &s;ituation, would &s;eem to be placed behind it. This apparent tran&s;po&s;ition could not be ef|fected by any other means than a change of &s;i|tuation from left to right; for, in a long range of objects, we cannot apprehend what is really behind to be &s;ituated before any one of the&s;e objects, without &s;eeing on the right what is on the left, or on the left what is on the right.</P>
<P>I have thus mentioned the principal defects of the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing; and &s;hall now proceed to examine the nature, properties, and extent of that admirable organ by which we are enabled to have a communication with the mo&s;t di&s;tant objects. Sight is a &s;pecies of touching, but very different from the common &s;pecies of that &s;en&s;e. Before we can touch any object, we mu&s;t either approach it with &s;ome part of our body, or it mu&s;t approach us. But, with the eye, we can <PB N="16" REF="21"> touch any object, however di&s;tant, if it tran&s;|mits a &s;ufficient quantity of light to make an im|pre&s;&s;ion on, or if its picture forms a &s;en&s;ible an|gle in, the eye. The &s;malle&s;t vi&s;ible angle is a|bout one minute. This angle, when an object is viewed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance of vi&s;ion, is a|bout the 3436th part of the diameter of that ob|ject. An object, for example, of a foot &s;quare, cea&s;es to be vi&s;ible at the di&s;tance of 3436 feet. A man of five feet high is not vi&s;ible beyond the di&s;tance of 17,180 feet, when the &s;un &s;hines.</P>
<P>But, with regard to the extent of human vi|&s;ion, an ob&s;ervation occurs, which &s;eems to have e&s;caped all the writers on optics: The extent of our &s;ight dimini&s;hes or augments in proportion to the quantity of light that &s;urrounds us, &s;uppo|&s;ing the illumination of the object to remain the &s;ame. If the &s;ame object which we &s;ee during the day at the di&s;tance of 3436 times its dia|meter, were equally illuminated during the night, it would be vi&s;ible at a di&s;tance 100 times greater. A candle is vi&s;ible in the night at the di&s;tance of more than two leagues; that is, &s;up|po&s;ing the diameter of the luminary to be one inch, it would be vi&s;ible at the di&s;tance of 316800 times the length of its diameter. But, in the day, this candle would not be di&s;cernible beyond ten or twelve thou&s;and times the length of its diameter. The &s;ame remark is applicable to all objects, when viewed during the day or the <PB N="17" REF="22"> night. We may, therefore, conclude, that the extent of our vi&s;ion is much greater than our fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition; and that the rea&s;on why we are often unable to di&s;tingui&s;h di&s;tant objects is le&s;s owing to a defect of light, or to the &s;mall|ne&s;s of the angle under which they are painted in the eye, than to the profu&s;ion of rays reflec|ted from intermediate objects, which, by their brilliancy, prevent us from perceiving the faint|er and more diverging rays that proceed from di&s;tant objects. The retina of the eye is like a canvas upon which objects are painted. The colour of tho&s;e pictures are bright or ob&s;cure, in proportion to the di&s;tances of the objects repre|&s;ented. When objects are very remote, their pictures on the retina are &s;o faint, that they are entirely obliterated by the vigorous and lively impre&s;&s;ions made on the eye by nearer objects, with which we are every where environed. But, when the intermediate objects emit only a feeble light, compared with that which proceeds from remote objects, as, for example, when we view a luminous body in the night-time, then the di|&s;tant object makes a di&s;tinct picture on the re|tina, and becomes perfectly vi&s;ible. It is a con|&s;equence of the&s;e facts, that a man, by placing him&s;elf in the dark, and employing a long tube, may make a tele&s;cope, which will have a con&s;i|derable effect even during the day. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a man at the bottom of a deep pit can &s;ee the &s;tars at noon; and this fact was not <PB N="18" REF="23"> unknown to the antients, as appears from the following pa&s;&s;age of Ari&s;totle: 
<Q>Manu enim admota, aut per fi&s;tulam, longius cernet. Qui|dam ex foveis putei&s;que interdum &s;tellas con|&s;piciunt.</Q></P>
<P>We may, therefore, affirm, that the human eye is capable of being affected with objects which &s;ubtend not an angle above a &s;econd, or le&s;s, even when they reflect no more light than when they were &s;een under an angle of one minute; and, con&s;equently, that the powers of this organ are greater than was formerly ima|gined. But, if objects, without forming a great|er angle, were furni&s;hed with a more inten&s;e light, we would &s;ee them at &s;till greater di&s;tances. A &s;mall taper, when vivid, is &s;een much farther than a flambeau that emits a dim light. In or|der to determine the utmo&s;t di&s;tance at which an object can be rendered vi&s;ible, three things fall to be con&s;idered: 1. The largene&s;s of the angle formed in the eye; 2. The degree of light with which the neighbouring and intermediate ob|jects are illuminated; and, 3. The inten&s;ity of the light proceeding from the object it&s;elf. Vi|&s;ion is affected by each of the&s;e cau&s;es; and it is only by e&s;timating and comparing them, that we can determine the di&s;tance at which any par|ticular object can be di&s;cerned. The following is a demon&s;trative proof of the influence of the inten&s;ity of light upon vi&s;ion. Tele&s;copes and micro&s;copes are known to be in&s;truments of the <PB N="19" REF="24"> &s;ame kind, each of them increa&s;ing the vi&s;ible angle of objects, whether they be really minute, or appear &s;o on account of their di&s;tance. Why then do tele&s;copes with difficulty magnify ob|jects a thou&s;and times, when a good micro&s;cope magnifies them more than a million? This dif|ference, it is apparent, proceeds only from the degree of light; for, if we could illuminate di|&s;tant objects with an additional quantity of rays, they would appear infinitely clearer, though &s;een under the &s;ame angle; and tele&s;copes would have the &s;ame effect upon di&s;tant objects as micro|&s;copes have upon minute bodies. But this is not a proper place for expatiating on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance at which any object can be &s;een is &s;eldom the &s;ame in both eyes. There are few men who have both eyes equally &s;trong. When this inequality is great, the &s;tronge&s;t eye is mo&s;t generally employed, which is the cau&s;e of &s;quint|ing, as I have el&s;ewhere proved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. anne&eacute; 1743. e&s;&s;ay's on di&s;tinct and indi&s;tinct vi&s;ion.</NOTE>. When both eyes are equally &s;trong, and directed to the &s;ame object, one would imagine that the vi&s;ion would be doubly di&s;tinct; but the difference has been found by experiment to be only one 13th part<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Jurin's</NOTE>; and this phaenomenon may admit of the follow|ing &s;olution. The two optic nerves, near the place where they come out of the &s;kull, unite, and then &s;eparate by an obtu&s;e angle before they <PB N="20" REF="25"> enter the eyes. The motion communicated to the&s;e nerves by the impre&s;&s;ion of objects on the retina, cannot be tran&s;mitted to the brain with|out pa&s;&s;ing the united part. Hence the&s;e two motions mu&s;t be combined, and produce a &s;imi|lar effect, as when two bodies moving upon two &s;ides of a &s;quare, and impinging on a third, make it move in the diagonal. Now, if the angle were about 115 or 116 degrees, the dia|gonal would be to the &s;ide as 13 to 12, which is the &s;ame ratio that the &s;en&s;ation re&s;ulting from both eyes bears to that which re&s;ults from one. The angle formed by the two optic nerves being nearly equal to that above &s;uppo&s;ed, the lo&s;s of &s;en&s;ation may be attributed to this po&s;ition of the nerves; and this lo&s;s will always increa&s;e in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the angle.</P>
<P>Short-&s;ighted per&s;ons are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ee objects larger than other men: But the rever&s;e is the truth; for they actually &s;ee them dimini&s;hed. I my&s;elf am &s;hort-&s;ighted, and my left eye is &s;tronger than my right. I have a thou&s;and times examined the &s;ame objects, as the letters of a book, at the &s;ame di&s;tance, fir&s;t with the one eye, and then with the other, and uni|formly found that objects appeared both cleare&s;t and large&s;t to the left eye; and, when I di&s;|torted one of my eyes to make an object appear double, the image pre&s;ented to the right eye was le&s;s than the other. I cannot, therefore, he&s;itate in pronouncing, that the more &s;hort-&s;ighted any <PB N="21" REF="26"> man is, he &s;ees objects proportionally dimini&s;hed. I examined &s;everal per&s;ons who had eyes une|qual in &s;trength, and all of them declared that they &s;aw objects larger with the &s;trong than with the weak eye. This phaenomenon is per|haps the effect of habit; for &s;hort-&s;ighted peo|ple, being accu&s;tomed to approach clo&s;e to ob|jects, and to view only a &s;mall portion of them at a time, their eyes acquire a &s;tandard of mag|nitude much le&s;s than other men, who can take in at once all the parts of larger bodies.</P>
<P>Short-&s;ightedne&s;s has been often a&s;cribed to a roundne&s;s or prominence of the eyes. But this cau&s;e is not &s;atisfactory; for &s;ome have &s;udden|ly become &s;hort-&s;ighted, as the young man men|tioned by Mr Smith in his optics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2. p. 10.</NOTE>, who became &s;hort-&s;ighted on coming out of a cold bath, and who, from that period, was always obliged to u&s;e a concave gla&s;s. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the cry&s;talline and vitreous humours were all at once inflated to &s;uch a degree as to produce this difference in vi&s;ion. Short-&s;ightedne&s;s may as well proceed from the re&s;pective po&s;ition of the different parts of the eye, and e&s;pecially of the retina, as from the form of the humours; it may proceed from a le&s;s degree of &s;en&s;ibility in the retina, from a &s;mallne&s;s of the pupil, &amp;c. In the two latter ca&s;es, it is true, concave gla&s;&s;es would be u&s;ele&s;s, and even hurtful; in the two former, they may be employed with advantage. <PB N="22" REF="27"> But &s;till, objects &s;een through the&s;e gla&s;&s;es are neither &s;o di&s;tinct, nor perceived at &s;uch a di|&s;tance, as other men &s;ee them with the naked eye; becau&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted per&s;ons, as formerly remarked, &s;ee the pictures in a dimini&s;hed form, and concave gla&s;&s;es dimini&s;h them &s;till farther: Whenever, therefore, the&s;e pictures become &s;o &s;mall as to make too faint an impre&s;&s;ion on the retina, they cea&s;e to be vi&s;ible; con&s;equently, people who labour under this defect, &s;ee not &s;o far with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of gla&s;&s;es as other men do with their eyes.</P>
<P>As the eyes of infants are le&s;s than tho&s;e of adults, they mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;ee objects le&s;s; be|cau&s;e the greate&s;t angle which an object can form in the eye mu&s;t always be proportioned to the dimen&s;ions of the retina: If the field of the retina, where the pictures of objects are formed, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be half an inch in adults, it will not exceed a third or a fourth of an inch in in|fants. Children, of cour&s;e, cannot &s;ee &s;o far as adults; for, as objects appear le&s;s to them, they mu&s;t &s;ooner become invi&s;ible. But as, in in|fants, the pupils are larger, in proportion to the &s;ize of their eyes, than tho&s;e of adults, they may derive &s;ome &s;mall advantage from this circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Old men, as the humours of their eyes are &s;aid to be dried up, ought to &s;ee nearer than young men: But the rever&s;e is true; for old <PB N="23" REF="28"> men &s;ee be&s;t at a di&s;tance. This alteration can|not proceed entirely from a diminution, or a flattening of the humours of the eye, but rather from a change of po&s;ition between its parts, as between the cornea and the cry&s;talline, or be|tween the vitreous humour and the retina. This may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the cornea becomes more &s;olid as we advance in years, and, con&s;equently, that it cannot readily a&s;&s;ume that convexity which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;ee near objects; and, as it mu&s;t be flattened by drying, this circum&s;tance alone is &s;ufficient to make old men &s;ee be&s;t at a di|&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Clear</HI> and <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> vi&s;ion, though different in their nature, are terms very generally confound|ed by writers on optics. We &s;ee an object <HI>clear|ly,</HI> whenever it is &s;ufficiently illuminated to en|able us to form a general idea of its figure; but we &s;ee it not <HI>di&s;tinctly,</HI> till it be &s;o near that we can recogni&s;e all its parts. When we view a di&s;tant tower, we &s;ee it clearly as &s;oon as we perceive it to be a tower; but we &s;ee it not di|&s;tinctly, till we approach &s;o near as to be able to determine not only its general dimen&s;ions, but to di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of which it is com|po&s;ed, as the order of architecture, the materials, the windows, &amp;c. We may, therefore, &s;ee an object clearly without &s;eeing it di&s;tinctly, and we may &s;ee it di&s;tinctly without &s;eeing it clearly; becau&s;e <PB N="24" REF="29"> di&s;tinct vi&s;ion implies a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive examination of the different parts of objects. Old men &s;ee clear|ly, but not di&s;tinctly: They perceive large or luminous objects at a di&s;tance; but they are un|able to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;mall objects, as the charac|ters of a book, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of magni|fying gla&s;&s;es. Short-&s;ighted per&s;ons, on the contrary, &s;ee &s;mall objects di&s;tinctly; but they have no clear vi&s;ion of large objects, unle&s;s they are dimini&s;hed by concave gla&s;&s;es. A great quantity of light is nece&s;&s;ary for clear vi&s;ion, and a &s;mall quantity is &s;ufficient for di&s;tinct vi&s;ion. Hence &s;hort-&s;ighted people &s;ee better in the night than other men.</P>
<P>When an object is too brilliant, or when the eye fixes too long upon the &s;ame object, the or|gan is injured or fatigued, vi&s;ion becomes in|di&s;tinct, and the image of the object, having made an impre&s;&s;ion too violent, or remained too long on the retina, &s;eems, for &s;ome time, to be painted on every body we look at. But I will not enlarge on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I have el&s;e|where given a full explication of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mem. de l'Acad. ann&eacute;e 1743.</NOTE>. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that nothing, perhaps, is more de|&s;tructive to the eye than too great a quantity of light. Blindne&s;s is exceedingly frequent in the northern regions, where the &s;now, illumi|nated by the rays of the &s;un, obliges travellers to cover their eyes with crape, to prevent the <PB N="25" REF="30"> dangerous, and often &s;udden, effects of too much light. In the &s;andy de&s;arts of Arabia, the re|flection of the light is &s;o violent, that the eyes are unable to &s;upport it. Such per&s;ons, there|fore, as are obliged to write or read long at a time, &s;hould beware of u&s;ing a &s;trong light.</P>

<HEAD>SECT VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sen&s;e of Hearing.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of hearing, like that of &s;eeing, conveys perceptions of di&s;tant objects; it is, of cour&s;e, &s;ubject to &s;imilar errors, and mu&s;t deceive us, when we have no opportunity of rectifying, by the touch, the ideas it excites. The &s;en&s;e of hearing communicates no di&s;tinct intelligence of the di&s;tance of the &s;onorous bo|dies. A great noi&s;e at a di&s;tance, and a &s;mall one when near, produce the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation; and, unle&s;s we derive aid from the other &s;en&s;es, we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the di&s;tance of the one from that of the other.</P>
<P>When we hear an unknown &s;ound, we can neither judge of the di&s;tance, nor of the mo|mentum of the &s;troke which gives ri&s;e to it. But, whenever we can a&s;certain the &s;pecies of any individual &s;ound, we are able to gue&s;s both at the di&s;tance and momentum of the &s;troke. If, for example, we hear the report of a cannon, or the &s;ound of a bell, we compare them with tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind which we have formerly heard, and form a gro&s;s judgment both of their di&s;tance and momentum.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32"> Every body that impinges on another pro|duces &s;ound: This &s;ound, in non-ela&s;tic bodies, is &s;imple, but multiplied in tho&s;e which are ela&s;tic. When we &s;trike a bell, a &s;ingle &s;troke produces a &s;ound, which is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively repeated as long as the &s;onorous body continues to vibrate. If, therefore, we had not acquired the habit of judging every &s;ound to be &s;ingle which is pro|duced by one &s;troke, we would conceive all &s;ounds to be multiplied. On this &s;ubject, I &s;hall relate an incident that happened to my&s;elf. When lying in bed half a&s;leep, my clock &s;truck, and I counted five &s;trokes of the hammer on the bell, which I heard di&s;tinctly. I immediately ro&s;e, and, upon examination, found that it was only one o'clock, and that only one &s;troke had been &s;truck on the bell; for there was not the &s;malle&s;t derangement in the machinery. After a little reflection, I concluded, that, if we knew not from experience that a &s;ingle &s;troke &s;hould produce but one &s;ound, every vibration of a bell would be heard as a &s;eparate &s;ound, and as if &s;everal &s;trokes had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been repeated on the &s;onorous body. When I heard the clock &s;trike, I was in the &s;ame &s;ituation with a per&s;on who had heard for the fir&s;t time, and who, ha|ving no idea of the manner in which &s;ound is produced, would judge only by the impre&s;&s;ion made on the ear; and, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, he would hear as many di&s;tinct &s;ounds as there were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vibrations.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="33"> It is the number of vibrations excited in ela|&s;tic bodies which con&s;titutes the tone of &s;ound. There is no tone in a &s;imple &s;ound. The re|port of a gun, or the crack of a whip, produce different &s;ounds; but they have no tone. It is the &s;ame with every in&s;tantaneous &s;ound. Tone con&s;i&s;ts in the duration of the &s;ame &s;ound for a certain time. This duration of &s;ound may be effected in two different ways: The fir&s;t, and mo&s;t common, is the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vibrations in ela&s;tic and &s;onorous bodies. But the &s;ame effect may be produced in none-ela&s;tic bodies by a quick repetition of &s;trokes; for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vibrations acts upon the ear in the &s;ame manner as if each vibration were a &s;eparate &s;troke.</P>
<P>By con&s;idering, in this view, the production of &s;ound, and the different tones which modify it, we &s;hall find, that a repetition of equal &s;trokes is nece&s;&s;ary to produce a tone from bodies in|capable of vibration. If the number of equal &s;trokes be augmented in the &s;ame time, the tone will only be rendered more equal and percep|tible, without changing either the &s;ound or the tone produced by the &s;trokes. But, if the force of the equal &s;trokes be augmented, the &s;ound will be &s;tronger, and the tone may be changed. For example, if the force of the &s;troke be dou|bled, it will produce a &s;ound doubly &s;trong; and if the tone of the former was an octave, that of the latter will be doubly grave.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="34"> May not ela&s;tic bodies, when &s;et a vibrating by a &s;ingle &s;troke, be regarded as bodies who&s;e figure and length preci&s;ely determine the force of the &s;troke, and limit it to the production of a certain &s;ound only? If one &s;troke on a bell have only half the force of another, it will not be heard at &s;o great a di&s;tance, but it will &s;till produce the &s;ame tone. It is the &s;ame with the &s;tring of an in&s;trument; the &s;ame length gives always the &s;ame tone. Should not this lead us to think, that, in the explication of the produc|tion of different tones by the greater or &s;maller number of vibrations alone, we mi&s;take the ef|fect for the cau&s;e? for, the vibrations of &s;ono|rous bodies being nothing el&s;e than what is pro|duced in non-ela&s;tic bodies by a frequent repe|tition of equal &s;trokes, a greater or le&s;&s;er num|ber of vibrations &s;hould have no more influence, with regard to tones, than the quicker or &s;lower repetition of &s;trokes made upon bodies which do not vibrate. Now, this quicker or &s;lower re|petition of &s;trokes produces no change; neither ought the frequency of vibrations; and the tone, which, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, depends upon the force of the &s;troke, depends, in the &s;econd ca&s;e, upon the volume of the &s;onorous body. If it be double the thickne&s;s, and of the &s;ame length, or double the length, and of the &s;ame thickne&s;s, the gravity of the tone will be double, in the &s;ame manner as the tone of a non-ela&s;tic body <PB N="30" REF="35"> is doubly grave, when &s;truck with a double weight or force.</P>
<P>If we &s;trike a body incapable of vibrating, with a double force, or a double ma&s;s of matter, it will produce a &s;ound doubly grave, or an oc|tave lower; for it is the &s;ame thing as if we &s;truck with two equal ma&s;&s;es in&s;tead of one of them, which would nece&s;&s;arily double the inten|&s;ity of the &s;ound. Suppo&s;e, then, that two non-ela&s;tic bodies are &s;truck, the one with a &s;ingle ma&s;s, the other with two, each of them equal to the fir&s;t; a &s;ound would be produced by the fir&s;t body, who&s;e inten&s;ity would be only one half of that produced by the &s;econd. But, if we &s;trike one of the&s;e bodies with two ma&s;&s;es, and the other with three; in this ca&s;e, the fir&s;t body would produce a &s;ound, the inten&s;ity of which would be one third le&s;s than that pro|duced by the &s;econd. In the &s;ame manner, if we &s;trike the one body with three equal ma&s;&s;es, and the other with four, the former will pro|duce a &s;ound, the inten&s;ity of which will be one fourth le&s;s than that produced by the latter. Now, in comparing numbers, we comprehend them mo&s;t ea&s;ily in the proportions of one to two, one to three, one to four, &amp;c.; and, of all the proportions comprehended between the &s;ingle and the double, tho&s;e which we perceive with the greate&s;t facility, are two to one, three to two, four to three, &amp;c. Thus, in judging of &s;ounds, the octave corre&s;ponds be&s;t with the <PB N="31" REF="36"> original &s;ound, then the fifth, and then the fourth; becau&s;e the&s;e &s;ounds are in the above proportion. For, if we &s;uppo&s;e the &s;mall bones of the ear to be hard unela&s;tic bodies, which receive &s;trokes of equal ma&s;&s;es of matter, we would more ea&s;ily refer the &s;ound produced by one of them to a certain &s;tandard, if the other &s;ounds were produced by ma&s;&s;es that were proportioned to the fir&s;t, as 1 to 2, 2 to 3, or 3 to 4; becau&s;e the&s;e are the propor|tions which the mind recognizes with the great|e&s;t facility. Thus, in con&s;idering &s;ound as a &s;en&s;ation, the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from harmony appears to con&s;i&s;t in the proportion between the fundamental &s;ound and the others which &s;ucceed it. If the&s;e other &s;ounds mea&s;ure exactly the fundamental &s;ound, they will be always harmo|nious and agreeable; but, when they are incom|men&s;urable, they will be har&s;h and di&s;cordant.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, why &s;hould one proportion, when it is exact, be more agreeable than ano|ther, which is le&s;s exact? I an&s;wer, that the cau&s;e of plea&s;ure originates from this ju&s;tne&s;s of pro|portion; for, whenever our &s;en&s;es are acted up|on in this manner, an agreeable &s;en&s;ation is the re&s;ult; and di&s;proportion, on the contrary, is always di&s;agreeable to us. We may recollect what was &s;aid concerning the blind man who received his &s;ight from the dexterity of Mr Che&s;|&s;elden. When he began to &s;ee, regular objects were more agreeable to him than tho&s;e which were rough and irregular. It is, therefore, unque&s;tion|able, <PB N="32" REF="37"> that the idea of beauty, and the plea|&s;ing &s;en&s;ations we receive by the eye, originate from regularity and proportion. It is the &s;ame with the &s;en&s;e of touching: Smooth, round, and uniform bodies afford us more plea&s;ure than tho&s;e which are rough and unequal. Thus the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e of touching, as well as from that of &s;eeing. is founded in the proportion of objects. Why, therefore, &s;hould not the plea&s;ures of the ear proceed from the proportion of &s;ounds?</P>
<P>Sound, like light, is not only propagated at a di&s;tance, but is capable of being reflected. The laws which regulate the reflection of &s;ound are not indeed &s;o well under&s;tood. All we know is, that &s;ound is reflected when its motion is in|terrupted by hard bodies: A mountain, a hou&s;e, a wall, reflect &s;ound, and &s;ometimes &s;o perfectly, that we imagine it proceeds from a direction oppo&s;ite to that of its original motion. Smooth concave &s;urfaces, as vaults, hollow rocks, &amp;c. produce the mo&s;t di&s;tinct echoes. The internal cavity of the ear is fitted for reflecting &s;ound in the mo&s;t perfect manner. It is hollowed out of the hard part of the temporal bone, like a cavern in a rock. In this cavity &s;ounds are re|peated and articulated; this repetition of &s;ound excites vibrations in the &s;olid parts of the lamina of the cochlea, which are communicated to the membranous part of the lamina; and this mem|branous part is an expan&s;ion of the auditory <PB N="33" REF="38"> nerve, which tran&s;mits the&s;e different vibrations to the mind. As the o&s;&s;eous parts are &s;olid and in&s;en&s;ible, they can only receive and reflect &s;ounds; the nerves alone are capable of produ|cing &s;en&s;ation. Now, in the organ of hearing, the only nervous part is a portion of the &s;piral lamina; all the re&s;t is &s;olid; and hence I have made this part the immediate organ of hearing, which may be farther proved by the following reflections.</P>
<P>The external ear is only an acce&s;&s;ory to the internal. Its concave windings may augment the quantity of &s;ound; but we can hear very well without the external ears, as appears from dogs and other animals which have had them cut off. The membrane of the tympanum is not more e&s;&s;ential to the perception of &s;ound than the ex|ternal ear; for many per&s;ons have heard di|&s;tinctly after this membrane was either entirely or partly de&s;troyed. Some per&s;ons can make the &s;moke of tobacco, &s;ilk cords, lead plates, &amp;c. pa&s;s from the mouth to the ear, and yet they hear as well as other men. Neither do the &s;mall bones of the ear &s;eem to be e&s;&s;ential to hearing. It has frequently happened, that the&s;e bones have been carious, and have even come out of the ear, without de&s;troying the &s;en&s;e of hearing. Be&s;ides, birds have no &s;uch bones; and yet they have mo&s;t delicate ears. The &s;emicircular ca|nals appear to be more nece&s;&s;ary. They are a kind of winding tubes in the os petro&s;um, that <PB N="34" REF="39"> &s;eem to direct and conduct the &s;onorous par|ticles to the membranous part of the cochlea, upon which &s;ound acts, and the &s;en&s;ation of it is produced.</P>
<P>Deafne&s;s is incident to old age; becau&s;e th&egrave; den&s;ity of the membranous part of the lamina of the cochlea augments in proportion as we ad|vance in years. When this part becomes too &s;olid, the per&s;on grows dull of hearing; and when it is entirely o&s;&s;ified, deafne&s;s is the con|&s;equence; becau&s;e there is no longer any &s;en&s;ible part of the organ capable to tran&s;mit the &s;en&s;a|tion of &s;ound to the mind. A deafne&s;s proceed|ing from this cau&s;e is incurable. But, when it proceeds from a &s;tuffing of the auditory canal with wax, or other vi&s;cid matter, it may be re|moved by &s;yringing, or even by in&s;truments. Whether deafne&s;s be occa&s;ioned by an external or internal cau&s;e, we may ea&s;ily a&s;certain, by putting a repeating watch into the per&s;on's mouth. If he hears it &s;trike, he may be a&s;&s;ured that his deafne&s;s is effected by an external cau&s;e, and that it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, admits of a reme|dy.</P>
<P>I have often remarked, that men who have unmu&s;ical ears, and bad voices, hear better with the one ear than with the other. I formerly ob&s;erved, that &s;quinting was occa&s;ioned by an inequality of &s;trength in the eyes: A per&s;on who &s;quints &s;ees not &s;o far with the di&s;torted eye as with the other. From this analogy I was led <PB N="35" REF="40"> to make &s;ome experiments on men who &s;ung fal&s;ely; and I uniformly found that they heard better with the one ear than with the other. Through each ear they receive a different &s;en|&s;ation, which produces a di&s;cordance in the to|tal re&s;ult; and thus, by always hearing fal&s;e, they nece&s;&s;arily &s;ing fal&s;e, without perceiving any defect. Per&s;ons of this kind are likewi&s;e often deceived as to the quarter from which a &s;ound i&s;&s;ues. If their be&s;t ear be the right one, &s;ounds will more frequently &s;eem to proceed from the right than from the left. I &s;peak here of &s;uch per&s;ons only as are born with this im|perfection; for, though a man advanced in life may, by accident, have one ear duller than ano|ther; yet, as he was formerly in the habit of receiving ju&s;t perceptions of &s;ound, neither his ear nor his voice will be affected by the change.</P>
<P>Trumpets or funnels employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the hearing, an&s;wer the &s;ame end as convex gla&s;&s;es to old or decayed eyes. The parts nece&s;&s;ary to hearing, as well as tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to vi&s;ion, be|come den&s;e and in&s;en&s;ible with age; and, there|fore, each of them equally requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art to augment the quantity of the medium through which their peculiar &s;en&s;ations are tran&s;|mitted. Trumpets for facilitating hearing might be rendered as exten&s;ively u&s;eful to the ear as tele&s;copes are to the eye; but the&s;e trumpets could not be employed with advantage, except|ing in &s;olitary and &s;ilent places; for neighbour|ing <PB N="36" REF="41"> &s;ounds are uniformly collected and blended with tho&s;e at a di&s;tance, and produce in the ear nothing but a confu&s;ed noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of hearing is of more importance to man than to any other animal. In the latter, it is only a pa&s;&s;ive quality of receiving impre&s;|&s;ions from di&s;tant objects; but, in man, it is not only a pa&s;&s;ive quality, but becomes active by the u&s;e of &s;peech. It is by this &s;en&s;e that we are enabled to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety, and to form a mutual communication of our &s;enti|ments. The organs of the voice would be en|tirely u&s;ele&s;s, if they were not excited to motion by the &s;en&s;e of hearing. A man deaf from his birth is nece&s;&s;arily dumb, and has no idea of ab&s;tract and general knowledge. We mu&s;t not omit, in this place, a &s;ingular account of a man who, for the fir&s;t time, &s;uddenly acquired the u&s;e of hearing, when he was at the age of 24 years. His hi&s;tory, of which the following is an a|bridgement, is recorded in the Memoirs of the French Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ann&eacute;e 1703, p. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<Q>A young man, of the town of Chartres, aged about 24, who had been deaf from his birth, began, all at once, to &s;peak, to the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of all who knew him. He in|formed his friends, that, for three or four months before, he had heard the &s;ound of bells; and that he was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at this new and unknown &s;en&s;ation. Some time <PB N="37" REF="42"> after, a kind of humour i&s;&s;ued from his left ear, and then he heard di&s;tinctly with both. During the&s;e three or four months, he li&s;tened to every thing; and, without attempting to &s;peak aloud, he accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to utter &s;oftly the words &s;poken by others. He laboured hard in ac|quiring the pronunciation of words, and in learning the ideas annexed to them. At length, thinking him&s;elf qualified to break &s;ilence, he declared that he could &s;peak, though &s;till im|perfectly. Soon after, he was interrogated by &s;ome able divines concerning his former condition. The principal que&s;tions turned upon God, the &s;oul, and moral good and evil. But of the&s;e &s;ubjects he &s;eemed not to have the &s;malle&s;t conception. Though he was born of Catholic parents, attended ma&s;s, was in&s;tructed to make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and to a&s;&s;ume all the external marks of devotion, he com|prehended nothing of their real intention. He had formed no di&s;tinct idea of death; and ex|i&s;ted purely in an animal &s;tate. Wholly oc|cupied with &s;en&s;ible objects, and with the few ideas he had acquired by the eye, he drew no conclu&s;ions from them. He did not want parts; but the under&s;tanding of a man, when deprived of the intercour&s;e of &s;ociety, has &s;o little exerci&s;e or cultivation, that he never thinks but when &s;en&s;ible objects obtrude them|&s;elves on his mind. The great &s;ource of hu|man <PB N="38" REF="43"> ideas ari&s;es from the reciprocal intercour&s;e of &s;ociety.</Q>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, however, to communicate ideas to deaf men, and to give them preci&s;e notions of general truths, by writing and by &s;igns. A man deaf from his birth may be taught to read, to write, to communicate even the mo&s;t compli|cated ideas, and to under&s;tand words by the motions of the lips. Nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the great re&s;emblance between the dif|ferent &s;en&s;es, and how far one may &s;upply the place of another.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject, it may not be improper to relate a fact of which I was an eye-witne&s;s. Mr. Rodrigue Pereire, a native of Portugal, ha|ving long &s;tudied the mo&s;t effectual methods of teaching the u&s;e of language to the deaf and dumb, brought a young man to my hou&s;e, aged about 19, who had been deaf from his birth. M. Pereire undertook to learn him to &s;peak, read, &amp;c. At the end of four months, the young man could pronounce &s;yllables and words; and, after ten months, he knew, and could pro|nounce about 1300 words. His education, &s;o happily commenced, was interrupted for nine months, by the ab&s;ence of his ma&s;ter, who then found that he had forgot a great part of what he had formerly learned. His pronun|ciation was extremely bad, and mo&s;t of his words had e&s;caped from his memory. M. Pe|reire renewed his in&s;tructions in the month of <PB N="39" REF="44"> February 1748, and from that time has never left him, (June 1749). This young man was pre&s;ented before one of the meetings of the French Academy, where &s;everal que&s;tions were put to him in writing. His replies, which he made both in writing and in words, were ex|tremely di&s;tinct. But his pronunciation was &s;low, and the tone of his voice was har&s;h. The&s;e defects, however, were unavoidable; for it is by imitation alone that we bring our organs gradually to form preci&s;e and well articulated &s;ounds: But a deaf man cannot imitate what he does not hear. The &s;hortne&s;s of the time employed by the ma&s;ter, and the &s;urpri&s;ing pro|gre&s;s of the pupil, who was not deficient in a|bility, fully evince that per&s;ons born deaf and dumb may, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, be taught to hold intercour&s;e with &s;ociety; for I am per&s;ua|ded, that, if this man had begun to be in&s;tructed at the age of &s;even or eight, he would have at|tained as many ideas as mankind generally po&s;|&s;e&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This conjecture is now fully verified by the labours of the ingenious MR BRAIDWOOD of Edinburgh, who has, for many years, taught, in his academy, great numbers of pupils, who had been born deaf, to &s;peak, to read, to conver&s;e by ob&s;erving the motions of other mens lips, and to under&s;tand grammar, morals, religion, and even the mo&s;t ab&s;tract &s;ciences.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Sen&s;es in general.</HEAD>
<P>ANIMAL bodies are compo&s;ed of different &s;ub&s;tances; &s;ome of which, as the bones, the fat, the blood, the lymph, &amp;c. are in&s;en&s;ible; and others, as the membranes and nerves, &s;eem to be active &s;ub&s;tances, which give &s;pring and vivacity to all the members. The nerves are the immediate in&s;truments of feeling: Their nature, indeed, is diver&s;ified by a difference in their di&s;po&s;ition: According to their arrangement, po&s;ition, and quality, they convey to the mind different &s;pecies of feeling, which have been di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>&s;en&s;ations,</HI> and which &s;eem, in effect, to have no re&s;emblance to each other. If we con&s;ider, however, that all the external &s;en&s;es proceed &s;olely from nervous ex|pan&s;ions differently arranged and &s;ituated; that the nerves are the general organ of feeling; and that no other &s;ub&s;tance in the animal body is en|dowed with this faculty; we &s;hall be inclined to believe, that the &s;en&s;es have one common origin, and that, as all nerves are only various forms of <PB N="41" REF="46"> the &s;ame individual &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;en&s;ations which re&s;ult from them differ not &s;o e&s;&s;entially from each other as they at fir&s;t appear.</P>
<P>The body of the eye is, perhaps, only an expan|&s;ion of the optic nerve. Its &s;ituation is more exter|nal than that of any other nerve; and it likewi&s;e conveys the mo&s;t lively and the mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;ation. It mu&s;t, therefore, be affected by the &s;malle&s;t particles of matter, as tho&s;e of light, and, of cour&s;e, convey to the mind &s;en&s;ations of all di&s;tant bodies which either emit or reflect light. The &s;ituation of the ear is more internal than that of the eye; neither is it furni&s;hed with &s;o large an expan&s;ion of nervous &s;ub&s;tance, and mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be endowed with a le&s;s degree of &s;en&s;ibility, and cannot be affected with par|ticles of matter &s;o minute as tho&s;e of light. But it is capable of being affected by gro&s;&s;er particles; and it tran&s;mits to the mind &s;en&s;ations of &s;uch di&s;tant bodies as are endowed with the faculty of putting the&s;e particles in motion. As the&s;e particles are gro&s;&s;er, and have le&s;s velocity than tho&s;e of light, they can only move a &s;hort way; and, con&s;equently, the &s;en&s;ations conveyed to us by the ear are much more limited, as to di&s;tance, than tho&s;e afforded by the eye. The membrane which is the &s;eat of &s;mell, is &s;till le&s;s &s;upplied with nerves than the ear, and can only give us &s;en&s;ations by the intervention of particles of mat|ter which are gro&s;&s;er and nearer the organ, as tho&s;e that i&s;&s;ue from odorous bodies. The&s;e <PB N="42" REF="47"> particles probably con&s;i&s;t of the e&s;&s;ential oils, which exhale and float in the air, as light bodies &s;wim in water: And, as the nerves are &s;till few|er and more divided on the tongue and palate, odoriferous particles are too weak to affect them. To produce the &s;en&s;ation of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> the oily or &s;a|line parts mu&s;t be detached from other bodies, and applied to the tongue. This &s;en&s;e differs greatly from that of &s;melling. The latter con|veys &s;en&s;ations of bodies at a certain di&s;tance; but the former requires actual contact, and per|haps the &s;olution of particular parts of bodies, as their &s;alts, oils, &amp;c. before any &s;en&s;ation is com|municated. La&s;tly, as the nerves are minutely divided, and thinly &s;pread over the &s;kin, it can|not be affected by the particles of which light, &s;ound, or odors, are compo&s;ed. Nothing le&s;s than contact can give us the ideas which are pro|per to the &s;en&s;e of touching; and, of cour&s;e, it conveys to us no information with regard to di&s;tant objects.</P>
<P>Hence the difference between the &s;en&s;es ap|pears to proceed from the &s;ituation of the nerves being more or le&s;s external, and from the great|er or &s;maller quantity of them be&s;towed on the different organs. It is for this rea&s;on that a nerve, when irritated by a blow, or laid bare by a wound, frequently gives us the &s;en&s;ation of light without the intervention of the eye; and, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, we often feel the &s;en&s;ation <PB N="43" REF="48"> of &s;ound, when the ear is not affected by any thing from without.</P>
<P>When the particles of light or of &s;ound are collected in great quantities, they form a kind of &s;olid ma&s;s, and produce &s;en&s;ations of different &s;pecies, which &s;eem to have no analogy with the original &s;en&s;ations: A very great a&s;&s;emblage of luminous particles affect not only the eyes, but the nerves of the &s;kin, in which they excite the &s;en&s;ation of heat, which is a feeling different from that of vi&s;ion, though it be produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e. Heat, therefore, is a &s;en&s;ation proceeding from contact with light, which acts as a &s;olid body, or as a ma&s;s of matter in mo|tion. This action of light, like other bodies in motion, is apparent when light &s;ub&s;tances are expo&s;ed to the focus of a burning gla&s;s: Before they are heated, the action of the light commu|nicates to them a motion, by which they are driven from their former &s;tation. Here heat acts like &s;olid bodies upon each other, &s;ince it is capable of di&s;placing light &s;ub&s;tances, and of communicating to them a motion by actual im|pul&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, when the particles of &s;ound are collected in great quantities, they pro|duce a &s;en&s;ible agitation in the body, which is very different from the action of &s;ound on the ear. A violent explo&s;ion, or a clap of thunder, produces a &s;uccu&s;&s;ion in us, and in every neigh|bouring body. Here &s;ound likewi&s;e acts as a <PB N="44" REF="49"> &s;olid body. This tremulous motion is not oc|ca&s;ioned by the agitation of the air; for, we per|ceive not that it is accompanied with wind; and, be&s;ides, even the &s;tronge&s;t wind does not produce &s;uch violent concu&s;&s;ions. It is owing to this action of the &s;onorous particles, that the vibra|tions excited in one &s;tring are communicated to the others; and the tremulous &s;en&s;ation we feel from a violent noi&s;e is very different from the &s;en&s;ation of &s;ound in the ear, though it be an effect of the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>All the varieties in our &s;en&s;ations proceed from the greater or le&s;&s;er quantity of nerves, and from their po&s;ition being more or le&s;s ex|ternal. This is the rea&s;on why &s;ome of the &s;en&s;es, as the eye, the ear, the no&s;e, are affected by the minute particles which i&s;&s;ue from par|ticular &s;ub&s;tances; and why others, as the &s;en&s;es of ta&s;ting and touching, require actual contact, or emanations of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind, by the lat|ter of which we receive the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;olidity, or fluidity, and of the heat of bodies.</P>
<P>A fluid differs from a &s;olid, becau&s;e its par|ticles have no coherence, or are not gro&s;s enough to admit of being laid hold of on different &s;ides at the &s;ame time. The particles of fluids touch one another but in one, or &s;o few points, that none of them can have any great degree of ad|he&s;ion with another. Solid bodies, even when reduced to an impalpable powder, do not ab&s;o|lutely lo&s;e their &s;olidity; becau&s;e their particles, <PB N="45" REF="50"> by touching each other in many points, &s;till pre&s;erve a degree of cohe&s;ion; and this is the rea&s;on why we can &s;queeze them together, and form them into large tangible ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of feeling extends over the whole body; but its exertions are different in different parts. The &s;en&s;ation of touching is excited by the application of foreign bodies to &s;ome part of our own body. If a foreign body be applied to the brea&s;t or &s;houlders, we feel it; but we have no idea of its figure, becau&s;e the brea&s;t or &s;houl|der touches the foreign body on one &s;ide only. The &s;ame remark is applicable to other parts which are incapable of folding round, or em|bracing at one time, &s;everal &s;ides of foreign bo|dies. The idea of figure can only be acquired by the flexible parts of the body, as the hands, which, from their &s;tructure, are enabled to feel different parts of &s;urfaces at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The hand is not the principal organ of touch, becau&s;e the extremities of the fingers are fur|ni&s;hed with a great quantity of nervous papillae, but becau&s;e it is divided into &s;everal parts, which are all flexible, all act at the &s;ame time, and are all obedient to the will. This alone is the &s;ource of all our ideas of figure and of magnitude. The &s;urface of the hand and fingers is greater, in pro|portion, than any other part of the body, be|cau&s;e no other part is &s;o much divided. This advantage, when joined to the flexibility of the fingers, renders the hand the mo&s;t perfect in&s;tru|ment <PB N="46" REF="51"> for conveying ideas of the figures of bo|dies. If the hand were divided into 20 or more fingers, the&s;e ideas would be &s;till more preci&s;e and exact; if, on the contrary, their pre&s;ent number were dimini&s;hed, or if the hand were totally deprived of fingers, our ideas of figure would be very confu&s;ed and indetermined.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e animals which are furni&s;hed with hands appear to have mo&s;t &s;agacity. Apes imitate the mechanical actions of man &s;o completely, that they &s;eem to be excited by the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations. But all animals which are deprived of hands can have no di&s;tinct idea of the figure or magnitude of objects; becau&s;e none of their parts are &s;uffi|ciently flexible and divided, to enable them to twi&s;t round the &s;urfaces of bodies. This is the rea&s;on why animals are often terrified at objects which ought to be familiar to them. The muz|zle is their principal organ of feeling, becau&s;e it is divided into two parts by the mouth, and becau&s;e the tongue &s;erves both for touching bo|dies, and for turning them over, which they often do, before they &s;eize them with their teeth. It is likewi&s;e probable, that animals which are furni&s;hed with many in&s;truments of feeling, as the cuttle-fi&s;h, the polypus, and other in&s;ects, have a &s;uperior faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing and of choo&s;ing what is agreeable or convenient for them. Hence fi&s;hes, who&s;e bodies are covered with &s;cales, ought to be the mo&s;t &s;tupid of ani|mals, becau&s;e they can have no knowledge of <PB N="47" REF="52"> the form of objects; and a very obtu&s;e &s;en&s;e of feeling mu&s;t be conveyed through the &s;cales. Hence al&s;o, all animals which have not divided extremities, as arms, legs, paws, &amp;c. mu&s;t have a more obtu&s;e &s;en&s;e of feeling than tho&s;e that are furni&s;hed with the&s;e in&s;truments of &s;en&s;ation. Serpents, however, are le&s;s &s;tupid than fi&s;hes; becau&s;e, though their &s;kin is hard and &s;caly, they have the faculty of twi&s;ting round bodies, and of obtaining, by this means, more accurate con|ceptions of their forms and qualities.</P>
<P>Thus the two chief ob&s;tacles to the exerci&s;e of the &s;en&s;e of feeling proceed, fir&s;t, from the uniformity of the bodies of animals, or from their want of flexible and divided extremities; and, &s;econdly, from the materials which cover the &s;kin, as hair, feathers, &s;cales, &s;hells, &amp;c. The harder and more &s;olid this covering is, the &s;en&s;e of feeling will be the le&s;s acute, and the finer and more delicate the &s;kin, the &s;en&s;ation of feeling will be the more lively and ex|qui&s;ite. Women, among other advantages over the men, have a finer &s;kin, and a more delicate perception of feeling.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of a foetus, while in the womb of the mother, is extremely delicate. It ought, therefore, to have a lively &s;en&s;e of external im|pre&s;&s;ions. But, as it &s;wims in a liquor, and as fluids blunt the action of every &s;hock from with|out, the foetus is rarely hurt, and never without &s;ome violent &s;hock be received by the mother. <PB N="48" REF="53"> Thus the &s;en&s;e of feeling, though it depends on the finene&s;s of the &s;kin, and is extended over the whole body, can have little exerci&s;e in the foetus-&s;tate: A foetus, therefore, though it may touch different parts of its own body with its hands, can have no di&s;tinct &s;en&s;ations ari&s;ing from the &s;en&s;e of feeling.</P>
<P>To a new-born infant, the hands are equally u&s;ele&s;s as they are to a foetus; becau&s;e, by the ab&s;urd practice of &s;waddling, they are not allow|ed to employ them for &s;ix or &s;even weeks after birth. The improvement of the &s;en&s;e of feeling, from which we derive all our knowledge, is by this means unque&s;tionably retarded. If a child had the free u&s;e of its hands the moment it came into the world, it would &s;ooner acquire ideas of the figure and magnitude of objects: And who can determine the influence which our fir&s;t ideas have upon tho&s;e that are afterwards acquired? One man, perhaps, excels another in genius and ability, only becau&s;e he has been permitted, at a more early period, to make an unre&s;trained u&s;e of the &s;en&s;e of feeling. Infants, as &s;oon as they are allowed to employ their hands, endea|vour to touch every object they &s;ee. They delight in handling every thing they can &s;eize: By feeling every part of bodies, they &s;eem to be de&s;irous of acquiring exact ideas of their form. It is in this manner they amu&s;e, or rather in|&s;truct, them&s;elves with new objects: And this pa&s;&s;ion for novelty continues to be our amu&s;e|ment during life.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54"> It is by the &s;en&s;e of feeling alone that we ac|quire real knowledge. The innumerable errors into which we are led by the illu&s;ions of the other &s;en&s;es are corrected by feeling. But how is this important &s;en&s;e originally unfolded? How do primary ideas arrive at the mind? Have we forgot every trace of what pa&s;&s;es in the darkne&s;s of infancy? How &s;hall we recall the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions of thought? Do not inquiries of this nature imply pre&s;umption and temerity? If the &s;ubject were le&s;s momentous, we might be liable to cen&s;ure. But the mind cannot, perhaps, be occupied with a &s;ubject more worthy of re&s;earch; and every effort ought to be exerted in the con|templation of great objects.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, then, a man in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation with him who fir&s;t received exi&s;tence, a man who&s;e organs were perfectly formed, but who was equally new to him&s;elf and to every external object which &s;urrounded him: What would be this man's fir&s;t &s;en&s;ations, and his fir&s;t judgments concerning him&s;elf, and the objects of his &s;en&s;ations? Were he to give a hi&s;tory of his thoughts, and of the manner in which he received impre&s;&s;ions, What information would he convey? To give per&s;picuity to facts, I &s;hall attempt to make him &s;peak for him&s;elf; and this &s;hort philo&s;ophical detail may not, perhaps, be an u&s;ele&s;s digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55"> I remember the moment when my exi&s;tence commenced: It was a moment replete with joy, amazement, and anxiety. I neither knew what I was, where I was, nor from whence I came. I opened my eyes; what an increa&s;e of &s;en&s;a|tion! The light, the cele&s;tial vault, the verdure of the earth, the tran&s;parency of the waters, gave animation to my &s;pirits, and conveyed plea|&s;ures which exceed the powers of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I at fir&s;t believed that all the&s;e objects exi&s;ted within me, and formed a part of my&s;elf. When totally ab&s;orbed in this idea, I turned my eyes to the Sun: His &s;plendour overpowered me. I involuntarily &s;hut out the light, and felt a &s;light degree of pain. During this moment of dark|ne&s;s, I imagined that I had lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of my being.</P>
<P>When reflecting, with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, upon this great change, I was rou&s;ed with a variety of &s;ounds. The &s;inging of birds, and the murmuring of the breezes, formed a concert, which excited the mo&s;t &s;weet and enchanting emotions. I li&s;tened long, and was convinced that the&s;e harmonious &s;ounds exi&s;ted within me.</P>
<P>Totally occupied with this new &s;pecies of ex|i&s;tence, I had already forgot the light, though the fir&s;t part of my being that I had recognized. I again, by accident, opened my eyes, and was <PB N="51" REF="56"> delighted to find my&s;elf recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o many brilliant objects. This plea&s;ure &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed every former &s;en&s;ation, and &s;u&s;pended, for a time, the charming melody of &s;ound.</P>
<P>I fixed my eyes on a thou&s;and objects: I foon perceived that I had the power of lo&s;ing and of recovering them, and that I could, at plea&s;ure, de&s;troy and renew this beautiful part of my ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>I could now &s;ee without a&s;toni&s;hment, and hear without anxiety, when a gentle breeze wafted perfumes to my no&s;trils. This new, and delightful &s;en&s;ation, agitated my frame, and gave a fre&s;h addition to my &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>Totally occupied by all the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, and loaded with plea&s;ures &s;o delicate and &s;o exten|&s;ive, I &s;uddenly aro&s;e, and was tran&s;ported by the perception of an unknown power.</P>
<P>I had made but a &s;ingle &s;tep, when the novel|ty of my &s;ituation rendered me immoveable. My &s;urpri&s;e was extreme. I thought my being fled from me: The movement I had made con|founded the objects of vi&s;ion; and the whole creation &s;eemed to be di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed my hand to my head; I touched my forehead and my eyes; and I felt every part of my body. The hand now appeared to be the principal organ of my exi&s;tence. The percep|tions afforded by this in&s;trument were &s;o di&s;tinct and &s;o perfect; the plea&s;ures conveyed by it were &s;o &s;uperior to tho&s;e of light and &s;ound, <PB N="52" REF="57"> that, for &s;ome time, I attached my&s;elf entirely to this &s;ub&s;tantial part of my being, and I per|ceived that my ideas began to a&s;&s;ume a con&s;i|&s;tence and a reality which I had never before ex|perienced. Every part of my body, which I touched with my hand, reflected the &s;en&s;ation, and produced in my mind a double idea.</P>
<P>By this exerci&s;e I &s;oon learned, that the fa|culty of feeling was expanded over every part of my frame; and I began to recogni&s;e the li|mits of my exi&s;tence, which till now &s;eemed to be of an immen&s;e extent.</P>
<P>I &s;urveyed my body, and I judged it to be of a &s;ize &s;o immen&s;e, that all other objects, in com|pari&s;on, &s;eemed to be only luminous points. I followed my hand with my eyes, and ob&s;erved all its motions. Of all the&s;e objects my ideas were confu&s;ed and fallacious. I imagined that the motion of my hand was a kind of fugitive exi&s;tence, a mere &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;imilar cau&s;es; I brought my hand near my eye; it then &s;eemed to be larger than my whole body; for it con|cealed from my view almo&s;t every other object.</P>
<P>I began to &s;u&s;pect that there was &s;ome illu|&s;ion in the &s;en&s;ation conveyed by the eyes. I di&s;tinctly perceived my hand was only a &s;mall part of my body; but I was unable to compre|hend how it &s;hould appear &s;o enormou&s;ly large. I therefore re&s;olved to depend for information upon the &s;en&s;e of feeling alone, which had never <PB N="53" REF="58"> deceived me, and to be on my guard again&s;t all the other modes of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>This precaution was extremely u&s;eful to me. I renewed my motions, and walked with my face turned toward the heavens. I &s;truck again&s;t a palm tree, and felt a &s;light degree of pain. Seized with terror, I ventured to lay my hand upon the object, and di&s;covered it to be a being di&s;tinct from my&s;elf, becau&s;e it gave me not, like touching my own body, a double &s;en&s;ation: I turned from it with horror, and perceived, for the fir&s;t time, that there was &s;omething exter|nal, &s;omething which did not con&s;titute a part of my own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty that I could reconcile my&s;elf to this di&s;covery; but, after reflecting on the event which had happened, I concluded that I ought to judge concerning external objects in the &s;ame manner as I had judged concerning the parts of my body; and the &s;en&s;e of feeling alone could a&s;certain their exi&s;tence. I re&s;ol|ved, therefore, to feel every object that I &s;aw. I had a de&s;ire of touching the Sun; I according|ly &s;tretched forth my hands to embrace the hea|vens; but they met, without feeling any inter|mediate object.</P>
<P>Every experiment I made &s;erved only to in|crea&s;e my a&s;toni&s;hment; for all objects appear|ed to be equally near; and it was not till after an infinite number of trials, that I learned to u&s;e my eye as a guide to my hand. As the <PB N="54" REF="59"> hand gave me ideas totally different from the impre&s;&s;ions I received by the eye, my &s;en&s;ations were contradictory; the judgments I formed were imperfect; and my whole exi&s;tence was di&s;order and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Reflecting deeply on the nature of my being, the contradictions I had experienced filled me with humility: The more I meditated, my doubts and difficulties increa&s;ed. Fatigued with &s;o many uncertainties, and with anxious emo|tions which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively aro&s;e in my mind, my knees bended, and I &s;oon found my&s;elf in a &s;i|tuation of repo&s;e. This &s;tate of tranquility add|ed fre&s;h force to my &s;en&s;es. I was &s;eated un|der the &s;hade of a beautiful tree. Fruit of a vermilion hue hung down, in the form of grapes, within reach of my hand. The&s;e fruits I gently touched, and they in&s;tantly &s;eparated from the branch. In laying hold of one of them, I ima|gined I had made a great conque&s;t; and I re|joiced in the faculty of containing in my hand an entire being which made no part of my&s;elf. Its weight, though trifling, &s;eemed to be an a|nimated re&s;i&s;tence, which I had a plea&s;ure in being able to conquer.</P>
<P>I held the fruit near my eye: I examined its form and its colours. A delicious odor allured me to bring it near my lips, and I inhaled long draughts of its perfumes. When entirely oc|cupied with the &s;weetne&s;s of its fragrance, my mouth opened, and I di&s;covered that I had an <PB N="55" REF="60"> internal &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which was more de|licate and refined than that conveyed by the no|&s;trils. In fine, I ta&s;ted the fruit. The novelty of the &s;en&s;ation, and the exqui&s;itene&s;s of the &s;a|vour, filled me with a&s;toni&s;hment and tran&s;port. Till now I had only enjoyed plea&s;ures; but ta&s;te gave me an idea of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. The enjoy|ment was &s;o congenial and intimate, that it con|veyed to me the notion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or proper|ty. I thought that the &s;ub&s;tance of the fruit had become part of my own, and that I was en|dowed with the power of transforming bodies.</P>
<P>Charmed with this idea of power, and with the plea&s;ures I felt, I continued to pull and to cat. But an agreeable languor gradually im|paired my &s;en&s;es; my limbs grew heavy; and my mind &s;eemed to lo&s;e its natural activity. I perceived this inaction by the feeblene&s;s of my thoughts: The dullne&s;s of my &s;en&s;ations round|ed all external objects, and conveyed only weak and ill-defined ideas. At this in&s;tant my eyes &s;hut, and my head reclined upon the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Every thing now di&s;appeared: Darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion reigned. The train of my ideas was interrupted; and I lo&s;t the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my exi&s;tence. My &s;leep was profound; but, ha|ving no mode of mea&s;uring time, I knew no|thing of its duration. My awakening appeared to be a &s;econd birth; for I only perceived that I had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. This temporary annihi|lation <PB N="56" REF="61"> gave me the idea of fear, and made me conclude that my exi&s;tence was not permanent.</P>
<P>Another perplexity aro&s;e: I &s;u&s;pected that &s;leep had robbed me of &s;ome part of my powers: I tried my different &s;en&s;es, and endeavoured to recogni&s;e all my former faculties. When &s;ur|veying my body, in order to a&s;certain its iden|tity, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find at my &s;ide another form perfectly &s;imilar to my own! I conceived it to be another <HI>&s;elf</HI>; and, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing by &s;leep, I imagined my&s;elf to be doubled.</P>
<P>I ventured to lay my hand upon this new be|ing: With rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment I perceived that it was not my&s;elf, but &s;omething much more glorious and de&s;irable; and I imagined that my exi&s;tence was about to di&s;&s;olve, and to be wholly transfu&s;ed into this &s;econd part of my being.</P>
<P>I perceived her to be animated by the touch of my hand: I &s;aw her catch the expre&s;&s;ion in my eyes; and the lu&s;tre and vivacity of her own made a new &s;ource of life thrill in my veins. I ardently wi&s;hed to transfer my whole being to her; and this wi&s;h compleated my exi&s;tence; for now I di&s;covered a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant the Sun had fini&s;hed his cour&s;e; I perceived, with pain, that I lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing; and the pre&s;ent ob&s;curity recalled in vain the idea of my former &s;leep.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Varieties of the Human Species.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT we have hitherto remarked con|cerning the generation of man and the &s;tructure of his body, con&s;titutes only the hi&s;to|ry of the individual: That of the &s;pecies re|quires a &s;eparate detail, the principal facts of which mu&s;t be collected from the varieties that appear among men in different regions of the earth. The&s;e varieties may be reduced to three heads: 1. The colour; 2. The figure and &s;ta|ture; and 3. The di&s;po&s;itions of different peo|ple. Each of the&s;e heads, if exten&s;ively con|&s;idered, might afford materials for a volume; but we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e which are mo&s;t general and be&s;t a&s;certained.</P>
<P>With this view, we &s;hall &s;urvey the &s;urface of the earth, commencing with the northern regions. In Lapland, and on the northern coa&s;ts of Tartary, we find a race of men of an uncouth figure, and &s;mall &s;tature. Their countenances are equally &s;avage as their manners. The&s;e men, who ap|pear to be a degenerated &s;pecies, are very nume|rous, <PB N="58" REF="63"> and occupy va&s;t regions. The Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, and Mu&s;covite Laplanders, the inha|bitants of Nova Zembla, the Borandians, the Sa|moiedes, the northern Tartars, the O&s;tiacks of the Old Continent, and the Greenlanders and &s;ava|ges to the north of the E&s;quimaux Indians in the New Continent, appear to be all the &s;ame race, who have extended and multiplied along the coa&s;ts of the north &s;ea, in de&s;erts, and under cli|mates which could not be inhabited by other nations. All the&s;e people have broad large fa|ces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Voyage de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 169.; Il Genio vagante del Conte Aurelio degli Anzi; et les Voyages du Nord &s;aits par les Hoilandois.</NOTE>, and fiat no&s;es. Their eyes are of a yel|lowi&s;h brown colour, inclining to black<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Linnae Fauna Suecica, 1746. p. 1.</NOTE>; their eye-lids extend towards the temples<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See La Martiniere, p. 39.</NOTE>; their cheek-bones are very prominent; their mouths are large, and their lips thick and reflected; the under part of their face is narrow; they have a &s;queaking voice; the head is large, the hair black and &s;mooth; and the &s;kin of a tawny or &s;warthy hue. Their &s;ize is diminutive; but, though meagre, their form is &s;quat. Mo&s;t of them are only four feet high; and their talle&s;t men exceed not four feet and a half. This race is &s;o different from all others, that it &s;eems to con|&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for, if there be among them any di&s;tinction, it ari&s;es only from a great|er <PB N="59" REF="64"> or le&s;s degree of deformity. The Borandi|ans, for example, are &s;till le&s;s than the Laplan|ders. The iris of their eyes is of the &s;ame co|lour; but the white is of a reddi&s;h yellow: Their &s;kin is more tawny; and their legs, in|&s;tead of being &s;lender, like tho&s;e of the Lap|landers, are very thick, and &s;hapele&s;s. The Sa|moiedes are more &s;quat than the Laplanders; their heads are larger; their no&s;es are broader, and their complexion darker; their legs are &s;horter; their hair is longer, and their beards are more &s;canty. The &s;kin of the Greenlander is more tawny than that of the other nations, being of a deep olive colour; and, it is &s;aid, that &s;ome of them are as black as the Aethiopian. Among all the&s;e people, the women are fully as ugly as the men, and re&s;emble them &s;o much, that the di&s;tinction is not ea&s;ily perceived. The women of Greenland are very &s;hort; but their bodies are well proportioned. Their hair is blacker, and their &s;kin &s;ofter than tho&s;e of the Samoiede females. Their brea&s;ts are &s;o long and pliable, that they can &s;uckle their children over their &s;houlders. Their nipples are black as jet, and their &s;kin is of a very deep olive colour. Some travellers alledge that the&s;e women have no hair but upon their heads, and that they are not &s;ubject to the men&s;trual evacuation. Their vi&s;age is large; their eyes &s;mall, but black and lively; and their feet and hands are &s;hort. In every other re&s;pect, they re&s;emble the Samoiede <PB N="60" REF="65"> females. The &s;avages north of the E&s;quimaux, and even in the northern parts of the i&s;land of Newfoundland, have a great re&s;emblance to the Greenlanders. Like them, their &s;tature is &s;mall, their faces broad, and their no&s;es flat; but their eyes are larger than tho&s;e of the Laplander.</P>
<P>The&s;e people not only re&s;emble each other in deformity, in &s;mallne&s;s of &s;tature, and in the colour of their eyes and hair, but al&s;o in their di&s;po&s;itions and manners: They are all equally gro&s;s, &s;uper&s;titious, and &s;tupid. The Dani&s;h Laplanders have a large black cat, to which they communicate their &s;ecrets, and con&s;ult in all their important affairs; &s;uch as, whether this day &s;hould be employed in hunting or fi&s;hing. A|mong the Swedi&s;h Laplanders, a drum is kept in every family for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ulting the devil; and, though they are a robu&s;t and nimble people, &s;uch is their pu&s;illanimity, that they never could be per&s;uaded to face a field of battle. Gu&s;taphus Adolphus endeavoured to embody a regiment of Laplanders; but he was obliged to relinqui&s;h the project. They cannot, it would appear, exi&s;t but in their own coun|try, and in their own manner. To enable them to travel on the &s;now, they u&s;e &s;kates made of &s;ir-wood, about two ells long, and half a foot broad. The&s;e &s;kates are rai&s;ed before, with a hole in the middle for tying them &s;irm on the foot. With the&s;e they run on the &s;now with &s;uch rapidity, that they ea&s;ily overtake the <PB N="61" REF="66"> &s;wifte&s;t animals. They carry with them a pole pointed with iron at one end, and rounded at the other. This pole &s;erves to pu&s;h them along, to direct their cour&s;e, to pre&s;erve them from falling, to &s;top their impetuo&s;ity, and to kill the animals they overtake. With the&s;e &s;kates they de&s;cend the mo&s;t frightful precipices, and climb the &s;teepe&s;t and mo&s;t rugged mountains. The &s;kates u&s;ed by the Samoiedes are &s;horter, &s;eldom exceeding two feet in length. Among all the&s;e people, the women u&s;e &s;kates as well the men. They likewi&s;e employ the bow and the cro&s;s|bow; and, it is &s;aid, that the Mu&s;covite Lap|landers dart a javelin with &s;o much force and dexterity, that, at the di&s;tance of 30 paces, they are certain of hitting a mark not larger than a crown-piece; and that, at the &s;ame di&s;tance, they will transfix a human body. They hunt the ermine, the lynx, the fox, and the martin, and barter their &s;kins for brandy and tobacco. Their food con&s;i&s;ts principally of dried fi&s;h, and of the fle&s;h of the rein-deer and bear. Their bread is compo&s;ed of the pounded bones of fi&s;hes, mixed with the tender bark of the pine, or birch tree. Mo&s;t of them make no u&s;e of &s;alt. Their u&s;ual drink is whale-oil, - or water in which juniper berries have been infu&s;ed. They &s;eem to have no idea of religion, or of a Supreme Being. They are mo&s;tly idolaters, and exceedingly &s;u|per&s;titious. More gro&s;s than &s;avages, they have neither courage, dignity, nor a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. <PB N="62" REF="67"> The manners of the&s;e abject people &s;erve only to render them de&s;picable. They bathe naked, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly, boys and girls, mothers and &s;ons, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, without feeling the &s;malle&s;t &s;en&s;e of impropriety. When they come out of the baths, which are extremely warm, they immediately plunge them&s;elves into cold rivers. They offer their wives and daughters to &s;trangers, and e&s;teem it the highe&s;t affront if the offer be rejected. This cu&s;tom is univer&s;al a|mong the Samoiedes, the Borandians, the Laplan|ders, and the inhabitants of Greenland. In winter, the Laplanders clothe them&s;elves with the &s;kin of the rein-deer, and, in &s;ummer, with the &s;kins of birds. The u&s;e of linen is unknown to them. The women of Nova Zembla pierce their no&s;es and their ears, and ornament them with pendants of blue &s;tone; and, to increa&s;e their charms, they draw blue &s;treaks acro&s;s their forehead and chin&punc; Their hu&s;bands cut their beards into a round form, and wear no hair on the head. The Greenland women clothe them|&s;elves with the &s;kin of the dog-fi&s;h. They like|wi&s;e paint their faces blue and yellow, and wear pendants in their ears. They all live un|der ground, or in huts almo&s;t &s;unk below the &s;urface, and covered with the bark of trees, or bones of fi&s;hes. It is a common practice with them, during winter, to make &s;ubterraneous communications from hut to hut, by which they can vi&s;it their neighbours without going abroad. <PB N="63" REF="68"> A night, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal months, obliges them to illuminate their dreary abodes with lamps, in which they burn the &s;ame whale-oil that &s;erves them for drink. In &s;ummer they have hardly more ea&s;e than in winter; for they are obliged to live perpetually in a thick &s;moke. This is the only means they have hitherto con|trived to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the bite of the gnats, which are, perhaps, more numerous in this frozen country than in the Torrid Zone. Notwith&s;tanding this melancholy and hard mode of living, they are &s;eldom or never &s;ick, and all arrive at extreme old age. Even the old men are &s;o vigorous, that it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the young. Blindne&s;s, which is very frequent among them, is the on|ly malady to which they are &s;ubject. As their eyes are perpetually dazzled with the reflection from the &s;now in winter, autumn, and &s;pring, and involved in &s;moke during &s;ummer, few of them retain their &s;ight after they are advanced in years.</P>
<P>It is therefore apparent, that the Samoiedes, the Zemblians, the Borandians, the Laplanders, the Greenlanders, and the &s;avages to the north of the E&s;quimaux, are the &s;ame race of men; becau&s;e they re&s;emble one another in figure, in &s;tature, in colour, in manners, and even in &s;ingularity of cu&s;toms. The cu&s;tom of offering their wives and daughters to &s;trangers, and of being vain when the offer is accepted, may pro|ceed <PB N="64" REF="69"> from a &s;en&s;e of their own deformity, as well as that of their females, whom they are apt to think the more hand&s;ome, becau&s;e they are not de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;trangers. At any rate, it is certain, that this practice is general among all the&s;e nations, though very di&s;tant from each other, and though &s;eparated by a great &s;ea. We meet with it among the Crim Tartars, the Cal|mucs, and &s;everal other nations in Siberia and Tartary, who are almo&s;t equally ugly as the in|habitants of the more northern regions. In all the neighbouring nations, on the contrary, as China and Per&s;ia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Boulai informs us, that, after the death of the wives of the Schachs, they conceal the place where they are inter|red; and that the antient Egyptians would not embalm their wives till four or five days after their death, to prevent the &s;urgeons from having any temptation; Voyage de la Boulaie, p. 110.</NOTE>, where the women are beau|tiful, the men are remarkable for their jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>In examining the different nations adjacent to that va&s;t tract of land occupied by the Lap|landers, we find no relation between them and the race la&s;t mentioned. The O&s;tiacks and Ton|gu&s;ians, who border on the Samoiedes on the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, are the only people who have any re&s;emblance to them. The Samoiedes and Borandians have no &s;imilarity to the Ru&s;|&s;ians. The Laplanders re&s;emble not, in any manner, the Fins, the Goths, the Danes, or the Norwegians. The Greenlanders are totally dif|ferent from the &s;avages of Canada, who are large <PB N="65" REF="70"> and well made; and, though the tribes differ from one another, yet none of them have any analogy to the Laplanders. The O&s;tiacks, how|ever, &s;eem to be a le&s;s ugly, and a taller branch of the Samoiedes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Voyage de Everti&s;brand, p. 212, &amp;c. and les Nou|veaux Memoires &s;ur l'etat de la Ru&s;&s;ie, tom. 1. p. 270.</NOTE>. They feed upon raw fle&s;h or fi&s;h; they eat all kinds of animals without di&s;tinction; they prefer blood to water for their drink; like the Laplanders and Samoiedes, they are mo&s;tly idolaters; in a word, they appear to be the line which divides the Lapponian and Tartarian races; or, rather, the Laplanders, the Samoiedes, the Borandians, the Nova Zemblians, and perhaps the Greenlanders, and the Dwarfs of North America, may be con&s;idered as Tartars reduced to the lowe&s;t degree of degeneracy. The Tongu&s;ians &s;eem to be le&s;s degenerated than the O&s;tiacks; becau&s;e the former, though &s;uffi|ciently ugly, are taller and better proportioned. The Samoiedes and Laplanders lie under the 68th or 69th degree of latitude, but the O&s;tiacks under the 60th. The Tartars, who are &s;i|tuated along the Wolga, in the latitude of 55, are gro&s;s, &s;tupid, and brutal. Like the Tongu|&s;ians, they have no idea of religion; and they will not marry girls till they have had inter|cour&s;e with other men.</P>
<P>The Tartars occupy immen&s;e regions in A&s;ia. They &s;pread over that va&s;t tract of country ex|tending from Ru&s;&s;ia to Kam&s;chatka, a &s;pace of <PB N="66" REF="71"> 11 or 12 hundred leagues in length, by more than 750 in breadth, which is a territory more than 20 times larger than the kingdom of France. The Tartars border with China, the kingdoms of Boutan, and of Alva, and the Mogul and Per&s;ian empires, as far as the Ca&s;pian Sea, on the north and we&s;t. They &s;pread along the Wolga and the we&s;t coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, as far as Daghe&s;tan; they have penetrated to the north coa&s;t of the Black Sea, and have e&s;tabli&s;hments in Crimea, in Little Tartary near Moldavia, and in the Ukraine. All the&s;e people, even in their youth, have large wrinkled foreheads; their no&s;es are thick and &s;hort, and their eyes &s;mall and &s;unk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages de Rubru&s;quis, de Marc Paule, de Jean Struys, du Pere Avril, &amp;c.</NOTE>; their cheek-bones are very high, and the lower part of their face is very narrow; their chin is long and prominent, and the upper jaw falls in; the teeth are long and di&s;tinct from each other; the eye-brows are thick, and cover the eyes; the face is flat; the &s;kin is tawny or olive; and the hair is black. Their bodies are of a middle &s;tature, but &s;trong and robu&s;t. They have but little beard, and the hairs are di&s;|po&s;ed in tufts, like the beards of the Chine&s;e. Their thighs are thick, and their legs &s;hort. The Calmuck Tartars are the mo&s;t ugly; there is even &s;omething frightful in their countenance. They are all wandering vagabonds, living in tents made of cloth or of &s;kins. They eat the <PB N="67" REF="72"> fle&s;h of hor&s;es, and of other animals, either raw, or a little &s;oftened by putrifying under their &s;addles, and likewi&s;e fi&s;hes dried with the &s;un. Their common drink is mares milk fermented with the flour of millet. They all &s;have the head, excepting a little tuft which they allow to grow, in order to form two tre&s;&s;es, one of them to hang on each &s;ide of the face. The women, who are as ugly as the men, wear their hair, in which they fix little pieces of copper, and other ornaments of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Among mo&s;t of the&s;e tribes, no marks of re|ligion, or of decency in their manners, are to be found. They are all robbers; and the Tartars of Daghe&s;tan, who border on civilized nations, have a great trade in &s;laves, whom they carry off by force, and then &s;ell them to the Turks and Per&s;ians. Their wealth con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of hor&s;es, which are, perhaps, more numerous in Tartary than in any other country on the globe. The&s;e people live perpetually with their hor&s;es, and are continually occupied in training, dre&s;&s;ing, and exerci&s;ing them. They manage them with &s;uch addre&s;s, that a &s;tranger would imagine both creatures to be animated with the &s;ame mind. The&s;e hor&s;es not only obey the gentle&s;t mo|tions of the bridle, but they &s;eem to know the very intention of their riders.</P>
<P>To learn the particular differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the race of Tartars, we have only to compare the de&s;criptions given by travellers of <PB N="68" REF="73"> their different tribes. We are informed by Ta|vernier, that the Calmucks, who live in the neigh|bourhood of the Ca&s;pian Sea, between Mu&s;covy and Great Tartary, are robu&s;t men, but the mo&s;t ugly and deformed beings under Heaven. Their faces are &s;o large and &s;o flat, that their eyes, which are generally &s;mall, are &s;ituated five or &s;ix inches a&s;under. Their no&s;es are &s;o low, that, in&s;tead of no&s;trils, two holes are only to be &s;een; and their knees bend outward, and their legs inward. After the Calmucks, the Tartars of Daghe&s;tan hold the next rank in deformity. The Little Tartars, or tho&s;e of Nogai, who live near the Black Sea, are not &s;o ugly as the Calmucks, though they have flat faces, and &s;mall eyes, and re&s;em|ble the Calmucks in their general figure. By their intercour&s;e with the Circa&s;&s;ians, the Mol|davians, and other adjoining nations, this race of Tartars have perhaps lo&s;t a part of their ori|ginal deformity. The Tartars of Siberia, though, like the Calmucks, they have broad faces, &s;hort flat no&s;es, and &s;mall eyes, and though their lan|guage be very different, there is &s;till &s;o great a fimilarity between them, that they ought to be regarded as the &s;ame race of people. The Tar|tars of Brat&s;ki are con&s;idered by P&egrave;re Avril as of the &s;ame race with the Calmucks; and, in pro|portion as we advance ea&s;tward, and approach Independent Tartary, the features of the Tartars gradually &s;often; but the characters e&s;&s;ential to their race are never obliterated. La&s;tly, the <PB N="69" REF="74"> Mongou-Tartars, who conquered China, and were the mo&s;t poli&s;hed, though their features be le&s;s di&s;agreeable, yet, like all the other tribes, they have &s;mall eyes, large flat faces, thin black or red beards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Palafox, p. 444.</NOTE>, &s;hort &s;unk no&s;es, and a tawny complexion. The people of Thibet, and of the other &s;outhern provinces of Tartary, are al&s;o le&s;s deformed. Mr Sanchez, fir&s;t phy&s;ician to the Ru&s;&s;ian army, a man of great learning and ability, has obliged me with the following re|marks made by him in travelling through Tar|tary.</P>
<P>In the years 1735, 36, and 37, he vi&s;ited the Ukraine, the banks of the Don as far as the &s;ea of Zabach, and the confines of Cuban as far as A&s;oph. He traver&s;ed the de&s;erts which lie be|tween the country of the Crims and Backmut. He journeyed among the wandering Calmucks from the kingdom of Ca&s;an to the banks of the Don, among the Tartars of Crimea and Nogai, who wander between the Crimea and the U|kraine, and likewi&s;e among the Tartars of Ker|gi&s;&s;i and Tcheremi&s;&s;i, who are &s;ituated to the North of A&s;tracan, from the 50th to the 60th degree of latitude. He remarked, that the Tar|tars of Crimea and of the province of Cuban, were of a middle &s;tature; and that they had broad &s;houlders, narrow flanks, &s;trong nervous limbs, black eyes, and a tawny complexion. THe Tartars of Kergi&s;&s;i and Tcheremi&s;&s;i are &s;maller and more &s;quat; they are gro&s;&s;er, and le&s;s agile; <PB N="70" REF="75"> they have black eyes, a tawny hue, and faces &s;till broader than the former. He ob&s;erved, a|mong the&s;e Tartars, &s;everal men and women who had no re&s;emblance to them, and of whom &s;ome were as white as the inhabitants of Poland. As the&s;e nations abound with &s;laves, both male and female, who are carried off from Ru&s;&s;ia and Poland; as their religion permits a plurality of wives and concubines; and as their Sultans, Murzas, or Nobles, bring their wives from Cir|ca&s;&s;ia and Georgia, the children who &s;pring from &s;uch alliances are le&s;s deformed, and whiter than tho&s;e of the unmixed natives. There are even among the Tartars a whole nation, that of the Kabardin&s;ki, who are remarkably beautiful. M. Sanchez &s;aw no le&s;s than 300 of tho&s;e men in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice; and he a&s;&s;ures us, that he never &s;aw men make a more hand&s;ome figure. Their countenances were as fre&s;h and white as any in Europe; they had large balck eyes; and they were tall and well proportioned. He adds, that the Lieutenant General of Serapikin, who had lived long in Kabarda, informed him, that the women were equally beautiful. But this nation, &s;o totally different from the other Tartar tribes with which they are &s;urrounded, continued M. Sanchez, are &s;aid to have come originally from the Ukraine, and had been tran&s;ported into Kabarda about 150 years ago.</P>
<P>The blood of the Tartars is mixed on one &s;ide with the Chine&s;e, and, on the other, with the <PB N="71" REF="76"> oriental Ru&s;&s;ians. But the characteri&s;tic fea|tures of the race are not entirely obliterated by this mixture; for, among the Mu&s;covites, the Tartarian a&s;pect is very frequent; and, though the former have &s;prung from the common Eu|ropean race, we &s;till find many individuals with &s;quat bodies, thick thighs, and &s;hort legs, like the Tartars. But the Chine&s;e have &s;o great a re&s;emblance to the Tartars, that it is uncertain whether they be not of the very &s;ame race: The mo&s;t remarkable difference ari&s;es from a total di&s;parity in their di&s;po&s;itions, manners, and cu|&s;toms. The Tartars are fierce, warlike, and fond of hunting. They love fatigue and indepen|dence; and they are hardy and brutally gro&s;s. But the manners of the Chine&s;e are the very re|ver&s;e. They are effeminate, peaceable, indo|lent, &s;uper&s;titious, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, ceremonious, and para&s;itical. In their features and form, how|ever, they have a great re&s;emblance to the Tartars.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e, &s;ays Hugon, are large and fat men, with well-proportioned limbs, round broad faces, &s;mall eyes, large eye-brows, high eye-lids, and &s;mall &s;unk no&s;es. They have only &s;even or eight tufts of hair on each lip, and very little on the chin. Tho&s;e who live in the &s;outhern pro|vinces are browner and more tawny than tho&s;e in the northern parts; and their colour re&s;em|bles that of the people of Mauritania, or the more &s;warthy of the Spaniards: But, in the <PB N="72" REF="77"> middle provinces, they are as white as the Ger|mans. According to Dampier, and others, they are not all large and fat, though they regard the&s;e properties as great ornaments to the hu|man figure. Speaking of the inhabitants of the i&s;land of St John, on the coa&s;t of China, Dam|pier informs us, that they are tall, erect, and not incumbered with fat; that they have a long vi|&s;age and a high forehead; that their eyes are &s;mall, their no&s;e pretty large and elevated in the middle, their mouth of a moderate &s;ize, their lips thin, their complexion a&s;h-coloured, and their hair black; that they have naturally little beard; and that they pull out all the hairs, except a few on the chin and upper lip. According to Gentil, the Chine&s;e have nothing di&s;agreeable in their a&s;pect, e&s;pecially in the northern provinces: Tho&s;e whom nece&s;&s;ity expo&s;es to the &s;un, in the &s;outhern provinces, are tawny. In general, they have &s;mall oval eyes, &s;hort no&s;es, and thick bodies of a middle &s;tature. He a&s;&s;ures us, that the women u&s;e every art to dimini&s;h their eyes; and that the young girls, in&s;tructed by their mo|thers, continually extend their eye-lids, in or|der to make their eyes &s;mall and oblong, which, when joined to a flat no&s;e, and large, open, pen|dulous ears, con&s;titute a perfect beauty. He adds, that their complexion is fine, their lips of a beautiful red, their mouths well-&s;haped, and their hair exceedingly black; but that the chew|ing of betle blackens their teeth, and their con|&s;tant <PB N="73" REF="78"> u&s;e of paint &s;o greatly injures their &s;kin, that they have the appearance of old age before they arrive at 30 years.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ured by Palafox, that the Chine&s;e are whiter than the oriental Tartars; that they have al&s;o le&s;s beard; but that, in every other re&s;pect, there is little difference in the vi&s;ages of the&s;e two nations. It is very uncommon, he &s;ays, to &s;ee blue eyes either in China or the Philippine I&s;lands, excepting the Europeans, or tho&s;e born of European parents.</P>
<P>It is alledged by Innigo Biervillas, that the women of China are better made than the men. The faces of the latter, he ob&s;erves, are large, and their complexions yellowi&s;h; their no&s;es are broad and compre&s;&s;ed; and their bodies are thick and coar&s;e like tho&s;e of Dutchmen: The women, on the contrary, are exceedingly hand|&s;ome; their &s;kin and complexion are admirably &s;ine; and their eyes are extremely beautiful: But few of them, he adds, have good no&s;es, be|cau&s;e they are purpo&s;ely compre&s;&s;ed in their in|fancy.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Dutch voyagers agree that the Chi|ne&s;e, in general, have broad faces, &s;mall eyes, flat no&s;es, and hardly any beard; that the natives of Canton, and all along the &s;outhern coa&s;t, are as tawny as the inhabitants of Fez in Africa; but that tho&s;e of the interior provinces are mo&s;t|ly white. Now, if we compare the de&s;criptions of the Tartars and Chine&s;e given by the diffe|rent <PB N="74" REF="79"> authors above quoted, we cannot he&s;itate in pronouncing, that the Chine&s;e, though they differ a little in their &s;tature and in the form of their countenance, have a greater relation to the Tartars than to any other people, and that all the differences between them proceed entirely from climate and the mixture of races. This is the opinion of Chardin: 
<Q>'The &s;ize of the Little Tartars,' he remarks, 'is about four in|ches le&s;s than that of the Europeans; and they are thicker in the &s;ame proportion. Their complexion is copper-coloured; their faces are broad, flat, and &s;quare; their no&s;es are com|pre&s;&s;ed, and their eyes &s;mall. Now, the&s;e are the exact features of the Chine&s;e; for, after the mo&s;t minute examination, during my tra|vels, I found, that all the people, to the ea&s;t and north of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and to the ea&s;t of the Penin&s;ula of Malacca, have the &s;ame configuration of face, and nearly the &s;ame &s;ta|ture. From this circum&s;tance, I was induced to think, that all the&s;e people, notwith&s;tand|ing the varieties in their manners and com|plexion, &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;ource; for dif|ferences in colour proceed entirely from cli|mate and the manner of living; and varieties in manners originate from the &s;oil, and from the degrees of opulence enjoyed by different nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chardin, tom. 3. p. 86.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="80"> Father Parennin, who lived long in China, and accurately ob&s;erved the manners of that people, informs us, that the neighbouring na|tions on the we&s;t, from Thibet northward to Chamo, differed from the Chine&s;e in manners, language, features, and external conformation; that they are a rude, ignorant, &s;lothful people, faults very uncommon among the inhabitants of China; that, when any of the&s;e Tartars come to Pekin, and the Chine&s;e are a&s;ked the rea&s;on of the&s;e differences, they an&s;wer, that they are occa&s;ioned by the water and the &s;oil; or, in o|ther words, that the nature of the country pro|duces the&s;e changes in the bodies and di&s;po&s;itions of its inhabitants. He adds, that this remark &s;eems to be more verified in China than in any other country he ever &s;aw; and that, when fol|lowing the Emperor in a journey to Tartary, as far as the 48th degree of north latitude, he found Chine&s;e families from Nankin, who had &s;ettled there, who&s;e children had become perfect Mongous, having their heads &s;unk between their &s;houlders, crooked legs, and an a&s;pect that was truly gro&s;s and di&s;gu&s;ting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Recueil 24. des Lettres edifiantes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Japane&s;e are &s;o very &s;imilar to the Chi|ne&s;e, that they may be regarded as the &s;ame race of men; their colour is indeed darker, becau&s;e they live in a more &s;outhern climate. In gene|ral, their complexion is vigorous; their &s;tature &s;hort; their face and no&s;e broad and flat; their <PB N="76" REF="81"> eyes &s;mall; their beard thin; and their hair black. They are haughty, warlike, full of vigour and dexterity, civil and obliging, &s;mooth-tongued, and abound in compliments; but they are a vain and incon&s;tant people. They &s;u&s;tain, with in|credible patience, hunger, thir&s;t, cold, heat, fa|tigue, and all the other hard&s;hips of life. Like the Chine&s;e, they eat their meat with &s;mall &s;ticks, and, during their meals, they u&s;e a multitude of ceremonies and &s;trange grimaces. They are la|borious, &s;kilful artificers; and, in a word, their di&s;po&s;itions, manners, and cu&s;toms are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urd cu&s;tom of rendering the feet of their women &s;o &s;mall that they can hardly &s;up|port their bodies, is common to both nations. Some travellers affirm, that, when the Chine&s;e girls arrive at three years of age, their feet are bended in &s;uch a manner, that the toes lie un|der the &s;ole; that they apply aquafortis to burn off the fle&s;h; and then wrap them up in &s;trong bandages. They add, that the women feel the con&s;equences of this operation all their lives; for they walk with much difficulty, and their gate is exceedingly ungraceful. They chear|fully &s;ubmit, however, to this inconveniency; and, as it is a mean of plea&s;ing, they endeavour to make their feet as &s;mall as po&s;&s;ible. Other travellers deny that they break the feet, and al|ledge, that they only compre&s;s them &s;o forcibly as to prevent their growth: But all agree, that <PB N="77" REF="82"> every woman of fa&s;hion, and every woman that is reckoned hand&s;ome, mu&s;t have her feet &s;o &s;mall that they could enter with ea&s;e into the &s;hoe of a child of &s;ix years of age.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, upon the whole, conclude, that the Japane&s;e and Chine&s;e are the &s;ame race of men; that their civilization is of a very an|tient date; and that they differ more from the Tartars in their manners than in their figure. Their early civilization may be a&s;cribed to the fertility of the &s;oil, the mildne&s;s of the climate, and the vicinity of the &s;ea; while the Tartars, removed from the &s;ea, and &s;eparated from the &s;outhern nations by high mountains, have con|tinued to wander in their va&s;t de&s;erts, and un|der a climate, the rigour of which, e&s;pecially in the northern parts of Tartary, could only be &s;upported by a robu&s;t and uncultivated people. The country of Je&s;&s;o, which lies to the north of Japan, though &s;ituated under a climate which ought to be temperate, is, however, cold, barren, and mountainous: Its inhabitants are al&s;o totally different from tho&s;e of China and Japan. They are a gro&s;s brutal race, having neither manners nor arts. Their bodies are thick and &s;hort; their hair is long and bri&s;tly; their eyes are black; their forehead is flat, and their colour yellow, though le&s;s &s;o than that of the Japane&s;e. Their faces, as well as their whole body, are very hairy. They live like &s;avages, and their food con&s;i&s;ts of the fat and oil of whales, and <PB N="78" REF="83"> other fi&s;hes. They are exceedingly indolent, and &s;lovenly in their dre&s;s. Their children go almo&s;t naked; and the women have invented no other ornament but that of painting their eye-brows and lips of a blue colour. The &s;ole plea&s;ure and occupation of the men is hunting bears and rein-deer, and fi&s;hing whales. Though they have &s;ome Japane&s;e cu&s;toms, as that of &s;inging with a quavering voice, yet, in general, they have a greater re&s;emblance to the northern Tartars, or the Samoiedes, than to the natives of Japan.</P>
<P>In examining the people on the &s;outh and we&s;t of China, we find that the Cochin-chine&s;e, who inhabit a mountainous region that lies &s;outh of China, are more tawny, and more ugly than the Chine&s;e; and that the Tonquine&s;e, who&s;e country is more fertile, and who live under a colder climate than the Cochin-chine&s;e, are more hand&s;ome and beautiful. Dampier tells us, that the Tonquine&s;e are of a middle &s;tature; and that, though their complexion be tawny, their &s;kin is &s;o &s;mooth and delicate, that the &s;malle&s;t changes from redne&s;s to palene&s;s are perceptible in their faces, a circum&s;tance which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the other Indians. Their vi&s;age is generally flat and oval, their no&s;e and lips well proportioned, their hair black, long, and very thick; and they u&s;e every art to make their teeth black. According to the relations annex|ed to Tavernier's voyages, the Tonquine&s;e are <PB N="79" REF="84"> of a good &s;tature, and of an olive colour. They have not the flat faces and no&s;es of the Chine&s;e; and they are, in general, much hand&s;omer.</P>
<P>Thus, it appears, that the&s;e nations differ but little from the Chine&s;e: In colour they re&s;emble the inhabitants of the &s;outhern provinces of China. If they are more tawny, it is owing to their living under a warmer climate; and, though their faces and no&s;es be more prominent, they may &s;till be regarded as people &s;prung from the &s;ame origin.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to the natives of Siam, of Pegu, of Aracan, of Laos, &amp;c. the features of all the&s;e nations having a &s;triking re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the Chine&s;e; and, though they differ from the Chine&s;e in colour, yet they differ much more from the other Indians. The &s;tature of the Siame&s;e, according to Loub&egrave;re, is rather &s;mall; their bodies are well made; their faces are large, and their cheek-bones promi|nent; their forehead &s;uddenly contracts, and terminates in a point, like the chin; their eyes are &s;mall and oblique; the white of the eye is yellowi&s;h; the cheeks are hollow, from the ele|vation of the upper part of the cheek-bones; the mouth is large, the lips thick, and the teeth black; their complexion is coar&s;e, being a mix|ture of brown and red, or, according to other travellers, of an a&s;h-colour, which is, perhaps, as much owing to the perpetual fultrine&s;s of the air, as to their birth: Their no&s;e is &s;hort, and <PB N="80" REF="85"> rounded at the point; their ears are naturally large, and are much e&s;teemed when their &s;ize is remarkably great. This ta&s;te for long ears is common to all the ea&s;tern nations. Some draw the lob of the ear in order to lengthen it, and pierce it &s;o as only to allow the admi&s;&s;ion of an ordinary pendant; and others, as the natives of Laos, widen the holes in their ears &s;o prodigi|ou&s;ly, that they will almo&s;t admit a man's hand; and, by this means, their ears de&s;cend to the top of their &s;houlders. With regard to the Si|ame&s;e, however, their ears are naturally a little larger than ours. Their hair is coar&s;e, black, and &s;traight; and it is worn &s;o &s;hort, both by the men and the women, that it reaches no low|er than the ear all round the head. They a|noint their lips with a kind of perfumed poma|tum, which makes them appear unnaturally pale. They have little beard; and they always pull out the hairs: Nor is it cu&s;tomary to pare their nails, &amp;c. Struys informs us, that the women of Siam wear pendants in their ears, &s;o large and heavy, that the holes gradually grow wide enough to admit a thumb. He adds, that the colour of both men and women is tawny; that, though not tall, they are hand&s;ome; and that, in general, the Siame&s;e are a mild and po|li&s;hed people. Father Tachard remarks, that the Siame&s;e are very alert, and have among them dancers and tumblers as agile as tho&s;e in Europe. He tells us, that the cu&s;tom of black|ening <PB N="81" REF="86"> their teeth proceeds from a notion they entertain of its being un&s;eemly for men to have white teeth, like the brutes. They be&s;mear them with black varni&s;h, and ab&s;tain three or four days from meat, in order to make it adhere the more firmly.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the kingdoms of Pegu and Aracan differ not from tho&s;e of China and Siam, excepting in their colour, which is a little black|er

<P>All the&s;e nations, it is apparent, differ little from the Chine&s;e, and re&s;emble the Tartars in the &s;mallne&s;s of their eyes, their flat vi&s;ages, and their olive colour. But, in proceeding &s;outh|ward, <PB N="82" REF="87"> the features begin to be diver&s;ified in a more &s;en&s;ible manner. The inhabitants of Ma|lacca, and of the i&s;land of Sumatra, are black, &s;mall, active, and well proportioned.

Fa|ther Tachard remarks, that the people of Java are robu&s;t and hand&s;ome; that they &s;eem to be active and re&s;olute; and that the extreme heat of the climate obliges them to go naked.

<P>From all the&s;e relations, we may conclude, that the inhabitants of Java greatly re&s;emble the Tartars and Chine&s;e, while tho&s;e of Malacca, Sumatra, and the &s;mall adjacent i&s;lands, differ from them, both in their features and in the form of their bodies. Neither is it difficult to account for this phaenomenon; for the penin&s;ula of Ma|lacca, the i&s;lands of Sumatra and Java, as well <PB N="85" REF="90"> as all the other i&s;lands in the Indian Archipela|go, mu&s;t have been peopled by the neighbour|ing nations on the continent, and even the Eu|ropeans them&s;elves, who have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them near three centuries. This circum&s;tance mu&s;t have produced a great variety among the inhabitants, both in the features and colour, and in the form and proportions of their bodies. In the i&s;land of Java, for example, there are a peo|ple called <HI>Chacrelas,</HI> who are totally different, not only from the natives of this i&s;land, but from all the other Indians. The&s;e Chacrelas are white and fair, and their eyes are &s;o weak that they cannot &s;upport the rays of the &s;un. They go about, in the day, with their eyes half &s;hut, and directed to the ground; but they &s;ee be&s;t during the night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les Voyages de Legat. tom. 2. p. 137.</NOTE>.

<P>Turning northward, we find Manilla and the other Philippine i&s;lands, the inhabitants of which, by their alliances formed between the Spaniards, the Indians, the Chine&s;e, the Malabars, the Ne|groes, &amp;c. are perhaps more mixed than in any other part of the univer&s;e. The&s;e negroes, who live in the rocks and woods of Manilla, are en|tirely different from the other inhabitants. Some of them have cri&s;ped hair, like the negroes of Angola, and others long hair; their colour con|&s;i&s;ts of various &s;hades of black. Among the&s;e, &s;ome have been &s;een who had <HI>tails</HI> four or five inches long, like the i&s;landers mentioned by Ptolomy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Les Voyage de Gemelli Carreri, tom. 5. p. 68.</NOTE>. This traveller adds, that he was in|formed by Je&s;uites worthy of credit, that, in the i&s;land of Mindoro, which is adjacent to Manilla, there is a race of men, called <HI>Manghians,</HI> who have all tails of the &s;ame length; that &s;ome of the&s;e tailed men had even embraced the Catholic faith<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 5. p. 92.</NOTE>; and that they had olive complexions and long hair<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 5. p. 298.</NOTE>. Dampier tells us, that the in|habitants of the i&s;land of Mindanao, which is one of the principal and mo&s;t &s;outherly of the Philippines, are of a middle &s;tature; that their limbs are &s;lender, their bodies thin and &s;traight, <PB N="88" REF="93"> their vi&s;ages oval, their foreheads flat, their eyes black and &s;mall, their no&s;es &s;hort, their mouths large, their lips thin and red, their teeth black, their hair &s;mooth and black, their colour tawny and more yellow than &s;everal of the other In|dian tribes; that the women are hand&s;ome and fairer than the men; that their vi&s;age is longer, and their features &s;ufficiently regular, excepting the no&s;e, which is &s;hort and flat; that their limbs are &s;mall, and their hair long and black; and that the men, in general, are alert and inge|nious, but &s;lothful and addicted to robbery. We learn from the Lettres Edifiantes, that the inha|bitants of the Philippine i&s;lands re&s;emble the Malays, who formerly conquered the&s;e i&s;lands; that, like them, the no&s;e is &s;hort, the eyes large, the complexion of a yellowi&s;h olive colour, and their cu&s;toms and language are nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To the north of Manilla lies the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, which is not far di&s;tant from the pro|vince of Fokien in China. But the&s;e i&s;landers have no re&s;emblance to the Chine&s;e. Struys in|forms us, that the men of this i&s;land are of &s;mall &s;tature, particularly tho&s;e who live in the mountains; that they have flat faces; that the women have coar&s;e full brea&s;ts, and a beard like the men; that their ears are long, and their length is increa&s;ed by heavy &s;hells which they employ for pendants; that their hair is black and long, and their complexion of a yellowi&s;h black colour; that &s;ome of them are of a whiti&s;h yel|low, <PB N="89" REF="94"> and others entirely yellow; that they are extremely indolent, dexterous in managing the bow and the javelin, excellent &s;wimmers, and run with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. Struys expre&s;sly declares, that, in this i&s;land, he &s;aw a man with a tail more than a foot long, covered with red|di&s;h hair, and not unlike that of an ox; and that this tailed man a&s;&s;ured him, that the tail was a con&s;equence of the climate, for all the na|tives of the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land had tails of the &s;ame kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages de Struys, tom. 1. p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I know not what credit is due to this relation of Struys: If the fact concerning the tails be true, it mu&s;t be exaggerated; for it accords not with the accounts of other travellers, nor even with that of Ptolomy; and Marc Paul, in his Geographical de&s;cription, &s;ays, that, in the moun|tains of the kingdom of Lambry, there are men with tails only about a palm long. It appears that Struys re&s;ts upon the authority of Marc Paul, as Gemelli Carreri does upon that of Ptolomy; and that the tail he pretends to have &s;een is very different in its dimen&s;ions from that a&s;cribed by other travellers to the negroes of Manilla, the inhabitants of Lambry, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The editor of the Memoirs of P&s;almanazar, concerning the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, makes no mention of the&s;e extraordinary men; but he re|marks, that, though it be extremely warm in this i&s;land, the women are very fair and hand|&s;ome, particularly tho&s;e of them who are not <PB N="90" REF="95"> expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un; that they anxi|ou&s;ly pre&s;erve their complexion by the u&s;e of certain Iotions; that they are equally attentive to the beauty of their teeth, and, in&s;tead of paint|ing them black, like the Chine&s;e and Japane&s;e, they u&s;e every art to pre&s;erve their whitene&s;s; that the men are not tall, but thick and &s;trong; and that they are, in general, vigorous, indefa|tigable, good &s;oldiers, very dexterous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See la de&s;cription de l'i&s;le Formo&s;e, dre&s;&s;e&eacute; fur le Memoires de George P&s;almanazar, par le &s;ieur N.

<P>The Dutch voyagers, in their accounts of the natives of Formo&s;a, differ from all tho&s;e we have hitherto mentioned. Mandel&s;lo, as well as the writers of the collection of voyages which paved the way for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Dutch Ea&s;t|-India Company, inform us, that the&s;e i&s;landers are taller than the Europeans; that their colour is browni&s;h black; that their bodies are hairy; and that the women are of a low &s;tature, but robu&s;t, fat, and tolerably proportioned. In mo&s;t of the writers on this i&s;land, there is no men|tion of men with tails; and they differ widely from each other in their de&s;criptions of the form and features of the natives. But, with regard to one fact, which is no le&s;s extraordinary, they &s;eem entirely to agree; namely, that the women are not permitted to bear children till the age of 35, though they are at liberty to marry long before that period. Speaking of this cu&s;tom, <PB N="91" REF="96"> Rechteren expre&s;&s;es, him&s;elf in the following terms:

They wear rings in their <PB N="93" REF="98"> ears and no&s;es, and &s;ometimes in the partition of the no&s;e. They likewi&s;e wear bracelets of mo|ther of pearl above the elbows and on the wri&s;ts, and they cover their heads with caps made of the bark of trees, painted with different colours. They are &s;trong and well proportioned, have black teeth, a pretty good beard, and black and cri&s;ped hair, though not &s;o woolly as that of the negroes.

<P>The natives of the coa&s;t of New Holland, which is &s;ituated in the 16th degree of &s;outh la|ttitude, and beyond the i&s;land of Timor, are per|haps the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the human &s;pecies, and approach neare&s;t to the brutes. They are tall, erect, and thin; their limbs are long and &s;lender; they have large heads, a round fore|head, and thick eye-brows: Their eye-lids are always half-&s;hut, a habit which they contract in infancy, to protect their eyes from the gnats; and, as they never open their eyes, they cannot &s;ee at a di&s;tance, without rai&s;ing their heads as if they were looking at &s;omething above them. They have thick no&s;es and lips, and large mouths: They pull out, it would appear, the two fore-teeth of the upper-jaw; for, in neither &s;ex, nor at any period of life, are the&s;e teeth to <PB N="95" REF="100"> be &s;een. They have no beard; their vi&s;age is long, without a &s;ingle feature that is agreeable; their hair is &s;hort, black, and cri&s;ped; and their &s;kin is as black as that of the Guiney Negroes. They have no cloathing but a piece of the bark of a tree tied round their wai&s;t, with a handful of long herbs in the middle. They have no hou&s;es, and they &s;leep on the ground without any covering. They a&s;&s;ociate, men, women, and children, promi&s;cuou&s;ly, to the number of 20 or 30. Their only nouri&s;hment is a &s;mall fi&s;h which they catch in re&s;ervoirs made with &s;tones in &s;mall arms of the &s;ea; and they are totally unacquainted with bread, and every &s;pe|cies of grain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dampier, tom. 2. p. 171.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>From the&s;e de&s;criptions, it is apparent, that the i&s;lands and coa&s;ts of the Indian ocean are peopled with men of very different races. The natives of Malacca, of Sumatra, and of the Ni|cobar i&s;lands, &s;eem to derive their origin from the inhabitants of the penin&s;ula of Indus; and tho&s;e of Java from the Chine&s;e, excepting the <PB N="96" REF="101"> white men called <HI>Chacrelas,</HI> who mu&s;t have &s;prung from the Europeans. The natives of the Molucca i&s;lands &s;eem al&s;o, in general, to have proceeded from the Indian penin&s;ula. But the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Timor, which lies neare&s;t to New Holland, are very &s;imilar to the people of that country. Tho&s;e of Formo&s;a, and of the Mariana i&s;lands, re&s;emble each other in &s;tature, &s;trength, and features, and they appear to form a race entirely di&s;tinct from every o|ther people in their neighbourhood. The Pa|pous, and other nations adjacent to New Guiney, are real negroes, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of Africa, though they are &s;eparated from that continent by a tract of &s;ea more than 2200 leagues over. The natives of New Holland have a &s;trong a|nalogy to the Hottentots. But, before drawing any conclu&s;ions from all the&s;e relations and di&s;|crepancies, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine the condi|tion of the nations of A&s;ia and Africa.</P>
<P>The Moguls, and other natives of the penin|&s;ula of India, nearly re&s;emble the Europeans in traits and features; but they differ more or le&s;s from them in colour. The Moguls are olive, though, in the Indian language, <HI>Mogul</HI> &s;ignifies

<P>The natives of Bengal are yellower than the Moguls; their manners are al&s;o totally different: Their women, in&s;tead of being cha&s;te, are &s;up|po&s;ed to be the mo&s;t la&s;civious in India. A great &s;lave-trade, both of males and females, is carried on in this country; and a number of eunuchs are made, both by a &s;imple privation of the te|&s;ticles, and by a total amputation of the parts.

<P>The natives of the Coromandel coa&s;t are blacker than tho&s;e of Bengal; they are al&s;o le&s;s civilized, and go almo&s;t naked. Tho&s;e of the Malabar coa&s;t are &s;till blacker. They have very long, &s;mooth, black hair, and are of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Europeans.

<P>The cu&s;toms of the different Indian nations are all very &s;ingular, if not whim&s;ical. The Banians eat nothing that is animated; they e|ven dread to kill the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect, and will not de&s;troy the lou&s;e that bites them. They throw rice and beans into the rivers, to nouri&s;h the fi&s;hes, and grain upon the ground, to feed the birds and in&s;ects. When they meet a hunter or a fi&s;her, they earne&s;tly beg of him to de&s;i&s;t: If he be deaf to their entreaties, they offer him mo|ney for his gun or net; and, if he does not com|ply, they trouble the waters to frighten the fi&s;hes, and &s;et up hideous cries to put the birds and o|ther game to flight<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Voyages de Struys, tom. 2. p. 225.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="104"> The Naires of Calicut form a band of nobles, who&s;e only profe&s;&s;ion is that of arms. The&s;e men, though of an olive colour, are comely and hand&s;ome. They are tall and hardy, full of courage, and very dexterous in the management of their weapons. They lengthen their ears to &s;uch a pitch, that they hang down on their &s;houl|ders, and &s;ometimes lower. The&s;e Naires are allowed only one wife; but the women may have as many hu&s;bands as they plea&s;e. Father Tachard, in his letter to Father la Chai&s;e, dated at Pondicherry February 16, 1702, tells us, that, in the ca&s;t or cla&s;s of nobles, a woman &s;ome|times has 10 hu&s;bands, whom they regard as &s;laves &s;ubjected to their beauty. This privilege is confined to ladies of rank; for the women of inferior condition are allowed but one hu&s;band: The latter, indeed, take care to alleviate this hard&s;hip by their commerce with &s;trangers, to who&s;e embraces they abandon them&s;elves with|out re&s;erve; and their hu&s;bands dare not &s;o much as challenge them. The mothers pro&s;titute their daughters even before they arrive at a proper age. The Naires or nobles of Calicut &s;eem to be of a different race from the burge&s;&s;es; for the latter, both males and females, are of a &s;maller &s;tature, and are wor&s;e &s;haped, and more ugly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pyrard, p. 411.</NOTE>. Among the Naires there are &s;ome men, as well as women, who&s;e legs are as thick as the body of an ordinary man. This deformity is not a <PB N="100" REF="105"> con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;e; for they have it from their birth. In &s;ome this mon&s;trous thickne&s;s is confined to one leg only. The &s;kin of the&s;e legs is hard and rough like a wart: Notwith|&s;tanding this cumber&s;ome deformity, the per&s;ons affected with it are nimble and active. This race of men with thick legs have not multiplied greatly, either among the Naires or the other Indians. They, however, appear in other pla|ces, and e&s;pecially in Ceylon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 416. See al&s;o Recueil des voyages de la Comp. de Holl. tom. 4. p. 362.</NOTE>, where they are &s;aid to be of the race of St Thomas.</P>

Orient. part. 1. p. 39.</NOTE>, they have large ears which hang down to their &s;houlders. Their a&s;pect is mild; and they are naturally alert, dexterous, and vivacious. Their hair, which is very black, is worn &s;hort by the men. The common people go almo&s;t naked; and the women, according to a cu&s;tom pretty general in India, have their bo&s;oms unco|vered<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Recueil des voyages, &amp;c. tom. 7. p. 19.</NOTE>. In the northern part of the i&s;land of Ceylon, there is a &s;pecies of &s;avages called <HI>Bedas,</HI> who occupy only a &s;mall di&s;trict, and &s;eem to be of a peculiar race. The &s;pot they inhabit is entirely covered with wood, in which they con|ceal them&s;elves &s;o clo&s;ely, that it is difficult to di&s;cover any of them. Their complexion is <PB N="101" REF="106"> fair, and &s;ometimes red, like that of the Euro|peans. Their language has no analogy with any of the other Indian languages. They have no villages nor hou&s;es, and hold no intercour&s;e with the re&s;t of mankind. Their arms con&s;i&s;t of bows and arrows, with which they kill a num|ber of boars, &s;tags, and other animals. They never dre&s;s their meat, but they &s;ea&s;on it with honey, with which they are plentifully provided. We are ignorant of the origin of this tribe, who are not numerous, and who live in detached fa|milies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See I'hi&s;t. de Ceylon, par Ribeyro, p. 177.</NOTE>. The&s;e Bedas of Ceylon, as well as the Chacrelas of Java, who are both fair and few in number, appear to be of European extrac|tion. It is probable, that &s;ome European men and women have been formerly left on the&s;e i&s;lands by &s;hipwreck, or otherwi&s;e, and that, for fear of being maltreated by the natives, they and their de&s;cendants confined them&s;elves to the woody and mountainous parts of the country, where they continue to live a &s;avage life, which, perhaps, wants not its charms to tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to it.</P>
<P>The natives of the Maldiva i&s;lands are &s;up|po&s;ed to have de&s;cended from tho&s;e of Ceylon, though there is no re&s;emblance between them: For the natives of Ceylon are black and de|formed; but tho&s;e of the Maldiva i&s;lands are hand&s;ome, and, excepting their olive colour, little different from the Europeans; be&s;ides, <PB N="102" REF="107"> they are a people compo&s;ed of all nations. The inhabitants of the northern parts of tho&s;e i&s;lands are more civilized than tho&s;e who inhabit the &s;outhern parts. The women, notwith&s;tanding their olive colour, are beautiful, and &s;ome of them are as fair as the Europeans. Their hair is univer&s;ally black: This they regard as a beau|ty; and they &s;tudiou&s;ly render the hair black by &s;having the heads of their boys and girls, e|very eight days, till they arrive at the age of nine or ten. This practice, it is probable, con|tributes to blacken the hair; for, though every man and woman has black hair, that of their children is &s;ometimes pretty fair. Another beauty among the women is to have their hair very long and very thick, and, for this purpo&s;e, they anoint their head and body with a perfu|med oil. The men are more hairy than tho&s;e of Europe. The&s;e i&s;landers love exerci&s;e, and are indu&s;trious arti&s;ts; they are &s;uper&s;titious, and much addicted to venery; though the wo|men carefully conceal their bo&s;oms, they are exceedingly indolent and debauched; they per|petually eat betle and other hot &s;pices.

<P>Goa is the principal &s;ettlement of the Portu|gueze in India; and, though its antient &s;plen|dour is much decayed, it &s;till continues to be an <PB N="104" REF="109"> opulent and commercial city. It was formerly the greate&s;t market for &s;laves in the whole world. Hand&s;ome women and girls were &s;old here from every nation of A&s;ia. The&s;e &s;laves were of all colours; and they were &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and in every &s;pecies of &s;ewing and embroidery. The Indians were mo&s;t enamoured with the Caffre girls from Mo&s;ambique, who are all black. 'It is remarkable,' &s;ays Pyrard, 'that the &s;weat of the Indians, whether male or female, has no un&s;avoury odor, while the &s;tench of the Afri|can negroes, when they are over-heated, is perfectly un&s;upportable.'

<P>The Per&s;ians are adjacent to the Moguls, and have a great re&s;emblance to them; tho&s;e e|&s;pecially who inhabit the &s;outhern parts of Per|&s;ia differ very little from the Indians. The na|tives of Ormus, and of the provinces of Ba&s;cia and Bala&s;cia, are very brown and tawny; tho&s;e of Che&s;mur, and of the other provinces of Per|&s;ia, where the heat is not &s;o great as at Ormus, are fairer; and tho&s;e of the northern provinces are tolerably white<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See la De&s;cription des Provinces Orientales par Marc Paul, p. 22. 39. and Py|rard, tom. 2. p. 256.</NOTE>. According to the Dutch travellers, the women in the i&s;lands of the Gulph of Per&s;ia are brown or yellow, and not at all agreeable. They have a large vi&s;age, and <PB N="105" REF="110"> ugly eyes. In &s;ome of their manners and cu|&s;toms, they re&s;emble the Indian women, as that of wearing rings in the cartilage of the no&s;e, and of pa&s;&s;ing a gold pin through the &s;kin of the no&s;e, near the eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Recueil des Voyages de la Comp. de Holl. tom. 5. p. 191.</NOTE>. Indeed, this cu&s;tom of piercing the no&s;e for the purpo&s;e of embel|li&s;hing it with rings and other trinkets, has ex|tended much farther than the Gulph of Per&s;ia; many of the Arabian women wear rings in their no&s;es; and it is a piece of gallantry among the men to &s;alute their wives through the&s;e rings, which are &s;ometimes &s;o large, that they encircle the whole mouth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See le Voyage fait par ordre du Roi dans la Pale&s;tine, par M.

<P>That the blood of the Per&s;ians, &s;ays Chardin, is naturally gro&s;s, appears from the Guebres, who are a remnant of the antient Per&s;ians, and are an ugly, ill made, rough &s;kinned people. This is al&s;o apparent from the inhabitants of the provinces in the neighbourhood of India, who are nearly as clum&s;y and deformed as the Gue|bres, <PB N="106" REF="111"> becau&s;e they never form alliances with any other tribes. But, in the other parts of the kingdom, the Per&s;ian blood is now highly re|fined by frequent intermixtures with the Geor|gians and Circa&s;&s;ians, two nations who &s;urpa&s;s all the world in per&s;onal beauty. There is hardly a man of rank in Per&s;ia who is not born of a Georgian or Circa&s;&s;ian mother; and even the King him&s;elf is commonly &s;prung, on the female &s;ide, from one or other of the&s;e coun|tries: As it is long &s;ince this mixture commen|ced, the Per&s;ian women have become very hand|&s;ome and beautiful, though they do not rival the ladies of Georgia. The men are generally tall and erect; their complexion is ruddy and vigorous, and they have a graceful air, and an engaging deportment. The mildne&s;s of the cli|mate, joined to their temperance in living, have a great influence in improving their per&s;onal beauty. This quality they inherit not from their fathers; for, without the mixture men|tioned above, the men of rank in Per&s;ia, who are de&s;cendants of the Tartars, would be ex|tremely ugly and deformed. The Per&s;ians, on the contrary, are refined and ingenious; their imagination is lively and fertile; though war|like, they are lovers of the arts and &s;ciences; they are vain, and extremely ambitious of prai&s;e; their temper is &s;oft and ductile; they are volup|tuous, and much addicted to gallantry and in|trigue; they are luxurious and prodigal, and <PB N="107" REF="112"> are equally &s;trangers to oeconomy and to com|merce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chardin, tom. 2. p. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, though in general pretty &s;ober, devour va&s;t quantities of fruit. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee a man eat 12 pounds of melons; &s;ome will devour three or four times that quantity; and many of them fall a &s;acri|fice to this exce&s;&s;ive appetite for fruit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages de Thevenot, tom. 2. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fine women, of all complexions, are common in Per&s;ia; for they are &s;elected by the merchants, from every country, on account of their beauty. The white women are brought from Poland, from Mu&s;covy, from Circa&s;&s;ia, from Georgia, and from the frontiers of Great Tartary: The tawny women are tran&s;ported from the Mogul's dominions, and from the kingdoms of Golcon|da and Vi&s;apore, and the blacks from Melinda and the coa&s;ts of the Red Sea<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages de Tavernier, tom. 2. p. 368.</NOTE>. A &s;trange &s;u|per&s;tition prevails among the inferior cla&s;s of women.

<P>When this ab&s;urd remedy does not &s;ucceed, they go into the canals of water which run from the baths, when they know that many men are employed in bathing them&s;elves; and, if this <PB N="108" REF="113"> &s;pecific be equally un&s;ucce&s;sful as the former, their la&s;t re&s;ource is to &s;wallow that part of the prepuce which is cut off in the operation of cir|cumci&s;ion, which they con&s;ider as a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t &s;terility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages de Gemelli Carreri, tom. 2. p. 200.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Per&s;ia, of Turkey, of Ara|bia, of Egypt, and of all Barbary, may be re|garded as the &s;ame race of people, who, in the time of Mahomet and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, extended their dominions by invading immen&s;e territories, and became exceedingly diver&s;ified by intermix|ing with the original natives of all the&s;e different countries. The Per&s;ians, the Turks, and the Moors, have acquired a degree of civilization: But the Arabs have generally continued in a &s;tate of lawle&s;s independency. Like the Tartars, they live without government, without law, and al|mo&s;t without &s;ociety. Rape, theft, and robbe|ry, are authori&s;ed by their chiefs. They glory in their vices, and have no regard to virtue; and they de&s;pi&s;e every human in&s;titution, excepting tho&s;e only which produce &s;uper&s;tition and fana|tici&s;m.</P>
<P>The Arabs, however, are enured to labour. They likewi&s;e accu&s;tom their hor&s;es to undergo the greate&s;t fatigue, and allow them to drink on|ly once in 24 hours.

<P>Among the Arabs who live in the de&s;erts on the frontiers of Treme&s;en and Tunis, the girls, to improve their beauty, paint their bodies with cyphers of a blue colour, which they accompli&s;h by means of vitriol and the point of a lancet. In this they are followed by the country Afri|cans, but not by tho&s;e who live in towns; for there they pre&s;erve the &s;ame colour they bring with them into the world. Some of them, in|deed, paint a &s;mall flower on their cheek, their forehead, or their chin, with the &s;moke of galls and &s;affron, which makes a fine black colour: They likewi&s;e blacken their eye-brows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 88.</NOTE>. La Boulaye informs us, that the Arabian women of the De&s;ert paint their hands, lips, and chin, of a blue colour; that mo&s;t of them wear rings of gold or &s;ilver, about three inches diameter, in their no&s;es; that, though they are born fair, their complexions are &s;poilt by being continually expo&s;ed to the &s;un; that the young girls are extremely agreeable, and &s;ing perpetually; but their &s;ongs are not melancholy and plaintive like tho&s;e of the Turks, but have a &s;till &s;tranger effect, becau&s;e they rai&s;e their voice, to the high|e&s;t pitch, and articulate with great rapidity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de la Boulaye le Gouz, p. 318.</NOTE>.
<Q>'The Arabian prince&s;&s;es and ladies,' another traveller remarks, 'whom I was permitted to <PB N="111" REF="116"> &s;ee, were extremely hand&s;ome, beautiful, and fair, becau&s;e they are always covered, from the rays of the &s;un. But the common women, be|&s;ide their natural tawny complexion, are very much blackened by the &s;un; their form is ex|ceedingly di&s;agreeable, and, excepting tho&s;e natural attractions which always accompany youth, I could never perceive any thing in their appearance that could plea&s;e the fancy. The&s;e women puncture their lips with needles, and cover them with gun-powder and the gall of oxes, which penetrate the &s;kin, and render their lips blue and livid during life. They practice the &s;ame art upon the angles of the mouth, on each &s;ide of the chin, and upon the cheeks. They blacken the eye-lids with a black powder, and draw a black line from the corner of each eye, in order to make them ap|pear more expanded; for the chief beauty of the ea&s;tern women con&s;i&s;ts in large, prominent eyes. Female beauty among the Arabs is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;aying, That &s;he has the eyes of the antelope. They always compare their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to this &s;prightly animal; and black eyes, and the eyes of the antelope, are the principal topics of their love &s;ongs. The an|telope is indeed a mo&s;t beautiful and hand|&s;ome creature, and has in its a&s;pect a certain degree of innocent timidity, which re&s;embles, in a &s;triking manner, the mode&s;ty and appre|hen&s;ion natural to young women. The ladies and new married wives blacken their eye-brows, <PB N="112" REF="117"> and make them join in the middle of the forehead. They puncture their arms and hands, and form upon them the figures of animals, flowers, &amp;c. and paint their nails of a reddi&s;h colour: The men al&s;o paint their hair and the tails of their hor&s;es with the &s;ame colour. The women pierce their ears in &s;everal pla|ces, for the purpo&s;e of hanging rings and broaches to them, and they al&s;o wear bracelets on their arms and legs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Le Voyage fait par ordre du Roi dans la Pale&s;tine, par M.

To this account it may be added, that the Arabs are exceedingly jealous of their wives; and that, though they either purcha&s;e them, or carry them off by force, they treat them with gentlene&s;s, and even with re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, though adjacent to the Arabs, and though governed by the &s;ame laws, and profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame religion, are very different in their manners and cu&s;toms. In all the towns and villages along the Nile, for example, we find young girls de&s;tined by the public to the plea&s;ure of travellers, without any obligation to pay for this indulgence. For this &s;pecies of ho&s;pitality, they have hou&s;es filled with the&s;e girls; and it is a pious practice with rich men, when about to die, to found and endow hou&s;es for this charitable purpo&s;e. When any of the&s;e young women bring forth male children, the mothers are obliged to rear them to the age of three or four years; after which the children <PB N="113" REF="118"> are carried to the patron of the hou&s;e, or his repre&s;entatives, who then take charge of them, and employ them as &s;laves. But the female children continue with their mothers, and &s;up|ply their place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Les Voyages de Paul Lucas, p. 363.</NOTE>. The Egyptian women are very brown, but have lively eyes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Les Voyages de Gemelli Carreri, tom. 1. p. 190.</NOTE>.

They are remarkable for bearing many children; and &s;ome travellers pretend, that the fertility occa&s;ioned by the inundation of the Nile, is not limited to the &s;oil alone, but ex|tends to men and other animals. They add, that the women uniformly conceive after either drinking, or bathing in the new water; that, in July and Augu&s;t, the women are generally im|pregnated, and bring forth in April and May; and that the cows commonly produce two calves, and the ewes two lambs<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Les Voyages du Sieur Lucas, p. 83.</NOTE>, &amp;c. It is difficult to reconcile the&s;e benign influences of the Nile with the trouble&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es it occa&s;ions; for M. Granger informs us, that the air of Egypt is un|whole&s;ome; that di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes are fre|quent, and &s;o very difficult to cure, that the pa|tients generally lo&s;e their &s;ight; that in Egypt there are more blind per&s;ons than in any other country; and that, during the increa&s;e of the Nile, mo&s;t of the inhabitants are &s;eized with ob|&s;tinate <PB N="114" REF="119"> dy&s;enteries, occa&s;ioned by the &s;alts with which the water is then impregnated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Granger's Voyage, p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>

Idlene&s;s and cowardice are the principal vices of the Egyptians. Their chief employment through the day is drinking coffee, &s;moaking tobacco, &s;leeping, and chatter|ing in the &s;treets. They are gro&s;sly ignorant, and yet they are puffed up with a fanta&s;tical va|nity. Though they acknowledge that they have lo&s;t their antient dignity, their &s;kill in &s;cience and in arms, their hi&s;tory, and even their lan|guage, and that, from a valiant and illu&s;trious nation, they have degenerated into &s;lavery and cowardice; yet, &s;uch is the haughtine&s;s of their di&s;po&s;ition, that they affect to de&s;pi&s;e all other nations, and are exceedingly offended when any per&s;on advi&s;es them to &s;end their children into Europe, to be in&s;tructed in the arts and &s;ciences<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Lucas, tom. 3. p. 194. and P.

<P>The numerous nations who inhabit the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean, from Egypt to the We&s;t|ern ocean, and the internal regions of Barbary, as far as Mount Atlas, are compo&s;ed of people <PB N="115" REF="120"> of different races, as the original natives, Arabs, Vandals, and Spaniards; and, in more antient times, the Romans and Egyptians peopled the&s;e territories with men of very different qualities. The inhabitants of the mountains of Arras, for example, have no re&s;emblance in their a&s;pect and complexion to the adjacent tribes. Their co|lour, in&s;tead of being tawny, is white and ruddy, and their hair is of a deep yellow; but that of the adjacent nations is black. From the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances Mr Shaw thinks it probable, that they are de&s;cendants of the Vandals, who, after their expul&s;ion, took refuge in certain parts of the&s;e mountains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>. The women of the kingdom of Tripoli, though adjacent to tho&s;e of Egypt, have not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to them. The for|mer are tall, and con&s;ider height of &s;tature as an e&s;&s;ential article of beauty. Like the Arabian females, they puncture and paint their cheeks and chin; and, as in Turkey, they are &s;o fond of red hair, that they paint that of their children with vermilion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Etat des royaumes de Barbarie, La Haie, 1704.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Moori&s;h women, in general, affect to wear their hair &s;o long as to reach to their heels; and tho&s;e who&s;e hair is &s;horter, u&s;e fal&s;e locks twi&s;ted round with ribbands. They paint the hair of their eye-lids with black lead, and they e&s;teem the dark colour which this &s;ub&s;tance gives to the eyes as a &s;ingular beauty. This cu&s;tom <PB N="116" REF="121"> is both very general and very antient; it was practi&s;ed by the ladies of Greece and Rome, as well as by tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Moori&s;h women would be reckon|ed hand&s;ome even in Europe. The &s;kin of their children is exceedingly fair and delicate; and, though the boys, by being expo&s;ed to the &s;un, &s;oon grow &s;warthy; yet the girls, who keep more within doors, pre&s;erve their beauty till the age of 30, when they commonly give o|ver child-bearing: But, as a recompen&s;e for this early &s;terlity, they are often mothers at the age of 11, and grandmothers at that of 22; and, as they live as long as the European wo|men, they generally &s;ee &s;everal generations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In reading Marmol's de&s;cription of the&s;e dif|ferent nations, it is obvious to remark, that the inhabitants of the mountains of Barbary are white, and that tho&s;e of the plains and &s;ea-coa&s;ts are very brown and tawny. He tells us, that the inhabitants of Capez, a city in the kingdom of Tunis, &s;ituated upon the Mediterranean coa&s;t, are poor, and very black<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Marmol, tom. 2. p. 536.</NOTE>; that tho&s;e who live along the banks of the river Dara in the king|dom of Morocco, are exceedingly tawny<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 2. p. 125.</NOTE>; and that, on the contrary, the inhabitants of Zarhou, and of the mountains of Fez, on the &s;ide of Mount Atlas, are very fair: He adds, that the latter are &s;o little affected with cold, that, in the <PB N="117" REF="122"> greate&s;t fro&s;ts and &s;now, they dre&s;s very lightly, and go with their heads uncovered during the whole year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marmol, tom. 2. p. 198. 305.</NOTE>. And, with regard to the Numi|dians, he &s;ays, that they are rather tawny than black; that the women are pretty fair and jolly, though the men are meagre<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 3. p. 6.</NOTE>; but that the in|habitants of Guaden, at the extremity of Numi|dia, and on the frontiers of Senegal, are rather black than tawny<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 3. p. 7.</NOTE>; that, on the other hand, the women of the province of Dara are beauti|ful and fre&s;h-coloured; and that, through this whole region, there are multitudes of negroe &s;laves of both &s;exes<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 3. p. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears, then, that, in the antient Continent, all the nations who live between the 20th and 30th, or 35th degree of north latitude, namely, from the Mogul Empire to Barbary, and even from the Ganges to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Mo|rocco, differ but little from each other, except|ing tho&s;e varieties which have ari&s;en from a mixture with more northern nations, who, from time to time, have conquered and peopled &s;ome of tho&s;e va&s;t regions. In this exten&s;ive territo|ry, which &s;tretches, within the &s;ame parallels, about 2000 leagues, the men, in general, are brown and tawny, but, at the &s;ame time, pretty comely and hand&s;ome. If we next examine tho&s;e who live under more temperate climates, we &s;hall find, that the natives of the northern <PB N="118" REF="123"> parts of the Mogul and Per&s;ian Empires, the Armenians, the Turks, the Georgians, the Min|grelians, the Circa&s;&s;ians, the Greeks, and the people of Europe in general, are the faire&s;t, and mo&s;t hand&s;ome men in the world; and that, however remote Ca&s;hmire may be from Spain, or Circa&s;&s;ia from France, the natives of the&s;e countries, which are nearly at an equal di&s;tance from the equator, have a &s;triking re&s;emblance to each other. The people of Ca&s;hmire, Bernier remarks, are renouned for their beauty. They are as hand&s;ome as the Europeans, and have no features of the Tartarian vi&s;age; neither have they tho&s;e flat no&s;es and pig-eyes &s;o univer&s;al among the adjacent nations. Their women are exceedingly beautiful; and it is a common prac|tice with &s;trangers, when they come to the Mo|gul court, to provide them&s;elves with Ca&s;hmi|rian wives, that they may have children by them as fair as true Moguls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyage de Bernier, tom. 2. p. 281.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The blood of Georgia is &s;till more refined than that of Ca&s;hmire. In this country, not an ugly countenance is to be &s;een: And, with regard to the women, nature has adorned them with a profu&s;ion of grace: They are tall, hand|&s;ome, &s;lender wai&s;ted; and their faces are truly charming<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Chardin, p. 204.</NOTE>. The men are likewi&s;e very hand|&s;ome<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See il Genio vagante del Conte Aurelio degli Anzi, tom. 1. p. 170.</NOTE>. They are naturally ingenious; and, <PB N="119" REF="124"> if their education did not render them extreme|ly ignorant and debauched, they might make no incon&s;iderable progre&s;s in the arts and &s;cien|ces. But there is not, perhaps, a country in the univer&s;e where drunkenne&s;s and libertini&s;m have arrived at &s;o high a pitch as in Georgia. Char|din tells us, that even the clergy are much ad|dicted to wine; that they keep a number of fe|male &s;laves in their hou&s;es, whom they u&s;e as concubines; and that nobody is offended at this practice, becau&s;e it is general, and even autho|ri&s;ed. He adds, that he was informed by the prefect of the Capuchins, that the Patriarch of Georgia declares publicly, that the man who does not get drunk at their great fe&s;tivals, as tho&s;e of Ea&s;ter and Chri&s;tmas, is unworthy of the name of a Chri&s;tian, and ought to be excom|municated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardin, p. 205.</NOTE>. With all the&s;e vices, however, the Georgians are a civil, humane, grave, and peaceable people. They &s;eldom indulge re&s;ent|ment; but, when they conceive a hatred again&s;t any per&s;on, they are never to be reconciled.</P>
<P>The women of Circa&s;&s;ia, Struys remarks, are likewi&s;e exceedingly fair and beautiful. Their complexion con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t delicate tints. Their forehead is large and &s;mooth; and, with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, their eye-brows are &s;o fine, that they re&s;emble curved threads of &s;ilk. Their eyes are large, attracting, and full of fire. Their no&s;es are well &s;haped, and their lips are <PB N="120" REF="125"> perfect vermilion. Their mouth is &s;mall, and the perpetual re&s;idence of &s;miles; their chin is the termination of the complete&s;t oval. Their neck and throat are extremely hand&s;ome; their &s;kin is white as &s;now; the colour of their hair is a beautiful black; their &s;tature is tall, and their carriage ea&s;y. They wear a little black cap, upon which is fa&s;tened a roller of the &s;ame colour. But, what is extremely ridiculous, the widows, in place of this roller, wear a blad|der of an ox or a cow, fully blown up with air, which disfigures them amazingly. In &s;ummer, the women of inferior &s;tation wear only a &s;hift, which is generally blue, yellow, or red, and o|pen to the middle of the body. Their brea&s;ts are finely formed; and, though pretty familiar with &s;trangers, they are faithful to their hu&s;|bands, who are by no means jealous of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Struys, tom. 2. p. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tavernier al&s;o informs us, that the women of Comania and Circa&s;&s;ia, like tho&s;e of Geor|gia, are very hand&s;ome and beautiful; that they retain the fre&s;hne&s;s of their complexion till the age of 45 or 50; that they are all very indu|&s;trious, and often employed in the mo&s;t labori|ous offices. The&s;e people have pre&s;erved un|common liberties in their laws regarding mar|riage. If a hu&s;band is not plea&s;ed with his wife, and makes the fir&s;t complaint, the &s;eigneur of the di&s;trict &s;ends for the wife, &s;ells her, and pro|vides the hu&s;band with another.

<P>The Mingrelians, according to the relations of travellers, are as hand&s;ome and beautiful as the Georgians or Circa&s;&s;ians, and they &s;eem to be the &s;ame race of people. 'In Mingrelia,' &s;ays Chardin, 'there are women extremely hand&s;ome, of a maje&s;tic air, who&s;e form and vi&s;age are enchanting, and their a&s;pect attracts every beholder. Tho&s;e who are le&s;s hand&s;ome, or advanced in years, daub their eye-brows, cheeks, forehead, no&s;e, and chin, with coar&s;e paint. Others only paint their eye-brows, and be&s;tow much attention to their dre&s;s, which is &s;imilar to that of the Per&s;ians. They wear a veil, which covers only the crown and back part of the head. Though lively, civil, and affectionate, they are extremely perfidious; and there is no wickedne&s;s which they will not perpetrate, in order to procure, to pre&s;erve, or to get rid of their gallants. The men have likewi&s;e many bad qualities. They are all trained to robbery, which they &s;tudy both as a bu&s;ine&s;s and an amu&s;ement. They relate, with extreme &s;atisfaction, the depredations they have committed, and derive from this polluted &s;ource their greate&s;t prai&s;e and honour. In Mingrelia, fal&s;ehood, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and theft, are good actions, and whoredom, bigamy, and ince&s;t, are virtuous habits. A man marries <PB N="122" REF="127"> two or three wives at a time, and keeps as many concubines as he chu&s;es. Hu&s;bands in this country, are not jealous of their wives; and, when a wife is detected in the act of infidelity, he has only a right to demand a pig from the gallant, who generally eats a &s;hare of it in com|pany with the hu&s;band and wife. To have many wives and concubines, they pretend to be a good and laudable practice, becau&s;e it en|ables them to beget the more children, whom they &s;ell for gold, or exchange for wares and provi&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardin, p. 77.</NOTE>.' The Mingrelian &s;laves are not dear. A man, from 25 to 40 years, may be pur|cha&s;ed for 15 crowns; and, when farther ad|vanced, for 8 or 10.

<P>The pre&s;ent natives of Judea re&s;emble the other Turks; only they are more &s;warthy than tho&s;e who live in Con&s;tantinople, or on the coa&s;ts of the Black Sea; in the &s;ame manner as the Arabians are browner than the Syrians, be|cau&s;e they inhabit a more &s;outhern climate.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to the Greeks; the inhabitants of the north are fairer than tho&s;e <PB N="125" REF="130"> of the i&s;lands or of the &s;outhern provinces. In general, the great women are &s;till more beauti|ful and vivacious than the Turks. They have likewi&s;e the advantage of enjoying a greater de|gree of liberty. Gemelli Carreri informs us, that the women of the i&s;land of Chio are fair, beau|tiful, lively, and very familiar with the men; that the young girls &s;ee &s;trangers without re|&s;traint; and that they all go with their necks uncovered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Gemelli Carreri, tom. 1. p. 110.</NOTE>. He likewi&s;e remarks, that the Greek women, e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of Con&s;tantinople, have extremely fine hair; but that tho&s;e who&s;e hair de&s;cends to their heels are le&s;s regular in their features<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. tom. 1. p. 363.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Greeks e&s;teem large eyes and high eye|brows as great points of beauty in either &s;ex<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. de Belon, p. 200.</NOTE>; and, it is worthy of remark, that, in all the bu&s;ts and medals of the antient Greeks, the eyes are much larger than in tho&s;e of the antient Ro|mans.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Archipelago are re|markably fine &s;wimmers and divers. Thevenot tells us, that they exerci&s;e them&s;elves in bring|ing up &s;ponges, and even lo&s;t goods, from the bottom of the &s;ea; and that, in the i&s;land of Samos, a young man cannot obtain a wife, un|le&s;s he be able to dive at lea&s;t eight<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The|venot, tom. 1. p. 206.</NOTE>, or, accor|ding <PB N="126" REF="131"> to Dapper, 20 fathoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cription des i&s;les de l'Archipel. par Dapper, p. 163.</NOTE>. The latter adds, that, in &s;ome of the i&s;lands, as that of Nicaria, they have a &s;trange practice of conver&s;ing with each other at great di&s;tances; and that their voices are &s;o &s;trong, that, at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league, and &s;ometimes of a whole league, tho&s;e i&s;landers can maintain a conver&s;a|tion, which is nece&s;&s;arily interrupted by long intervals, the an&s;wer not arriving for &s;everal &s;e|conds after the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Greeks, the Neapolitans, the Sicilians, the Cor&s;icans, the Sardinians, and the Spaniards, being &s;ituated nearly under the &s;ame latitude, are very &s;imilar in their complexions. All the&s;e people are more &s;warthy than the French, the Briti&s;h, the Germans, the Polanders, the Moldavians, the Circa&s;&s;ians, and all the other inhabitants of the northern parts of Europe, till we advance to Lap|land, where, as formerly remarked, we meet with another race of men. In travelling through Spain, a difference of colour is perceptible even at Bayonne; there the complexion of the wo|men is browner, and their eyes are more bril|liant
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Relation du voyage d' E&s;pagne, p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, though meagre, are hand&s;ome. Their features are regular, their eyes beautiful, and their teeth well arranged: But their com|plexion is yellow and &s;warthy. Their children are born fair and beautiful; but, as they grow <PB N="127" REF="132"> up, their colour changes in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner: The operation of the air and of the &s;un &s;oon ren|ders them &s;o yellow and tawny, that a Spaniard is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from a native of any other country in Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 187.</NOTE>. In &s;ome provinces of Spain, as in the environs of the river Bida&s;&s;ao, it has been remarked, that the inhabitants have ears of an uncommon &s;ize<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 326.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Black or brown hair begins to be unfrequent in Britain, in Flanders, in Holland, and in the northern provinces of Germany; and in Den|mark, Sweden, and Poland, it is &s;eldom to be met with. Linnaeus informs us, that the Goths are tall; that their hair is &s;traight, and as white as &s;ilver; and that the iris of their eye is bluei&s;h: <Q>Gothi corpore proceriore, capillis albidis rectis, oculorum iridibus cinereo-coerule&s;centibus.</Q> The Findlanders, he adds, are mu&s;cular and fle&s;hy; their hair is long, and of a whiti&s;h yel|low colour; and the iris of the eye is of a deep yellow: <Q>Fennones corpore toro&s;o, capillis fla|vis prolixis, oculorum iridibus fu&s;cis<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Linnaei Faunam Suecicam, p. 1.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The women of Sweden are very prolific. Rud|beck &s;ays, that they generally bring forth 8, 10, or 12 children; and that 18, 20, 24, and even 30, are not uncommon. He adds, that the men often exceed the age of 100 years; that &s;ome arrive at 140; and that one Swede lived 156, and another 161 years<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Olaii Rudbekii Atlantica.</NOTE>. But this author, <PB N="128" REF="133"> it mu&s;t be allowed, is an enthu&s;ia&s;t with regard to his country; and, in his e&s;timation, Sweden is the be&s;t country in the world. This extra|ordinary fertility in the Swedi&s;h women implies not an uncommon propen&s;ity to love. Man|kind are more cha&s;te in cold than in hot climates. Though the women of Sweden are le&s;s amorous than tho&s;e of Spain or Portugal, yet they bring forth more children. The northern nations, it is well known, have over-run all Europe to &s;uch a degree, that hi&s;torians have di&s;tingui&s;hed the North by the appellation of 'Officina Gentium.'</P>
<P>The author of the 'Hi&s;torical Voyages of Europe,' agrees with Rudbeck, that the Swedes live longer than any other people of Europe; and adds, that he &s;aw &s;everal men who, he was a&s;|&s;ured, had exceeded their 150th year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Voyages hi&s;toriques de l'Europe, tom. 8. p. 229.</NOTE>. This longevity of the Swedes he a&s;cribes to the &s;alu|brity of the air. He makes the &s;ame remark with regard to Denmark: The Danes, he &s;ays, are tall and robu&s;t, of a lively and florid com|plexion, and, on account of the &s;alubrity of the air they re&s;pire, live very long: The Dani&s;h women are al&s;o fair, hand&s;ome, and extreme|ly prolific<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 8. p. 279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Previous to the reign of the Czar Peter I. the Ru&s;&s;ians, we are told, were almo&s;t entirely bar|barous. Born in &s;lavery, they were ignorant, brutal, cruel, and had neither courage nor man|ners. <PB N="129" REF="134"> Men and women often bathed promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly in baths heated to a degree that would have been in&s;upportable to any other people; and, like the Laplanders, immediately after coming out of the&s;e hot baths, they plunged them&s;elves into cold water. Their food was extremely coar&s;e. Cucumbers or melons, which they brought from A&s;tracan, and pre&s;erved during the &s;um|mer in a mixture of water, flour, and &s;alt, were their favourite di&s;hes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la relation curicu&s;e de Mo&s;covic, p. 181.</NOTE>. Some ab&s;urd &s;cruples prevented them from eating particular meats, as pigeons and veal. But, even at this unrefined period, the women knew the arts of colouring their cheeks, pulling out their eye-brows, and painting artificial ones. They al&s;o adorned them&s;elves with jewels and pearls, and their gar|ments were made of valuable &s;tuffs. Is it not apparent, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, that the bar|barity of the Ru&s;&s;ians had already begun to de|cay, and that their &s;overeign had not &s;uch ama|zing difficulties in poli&s;hing them, as &s;ome au|thors are de&s;irous of in&s;inuating? They are now a civilized and commercial people; they are fond of the arts and &s;ciences, of public &s;pecta|cles, and of ingenious novelties. Such impor|tant changes cannot be produced by a great man; but a great man may be born in a fortunate mo|ment.</P>
<P>It has been alledged by &s;ome authors, that the air of Mu&s;covy is &s;o &s;alubrious as to prevent the <PB N="130" REF="135"> exi&s;tence of pe&s;tilential contagion. It is record|ed, however, in their own annals, that, in the 1421, and during the &s;ix &s;ub&s;equent years, the Mu&s;covites were &s;o dreadfully afflicted with con|tagious di&s;tempers, that the con&s;titution of their de&s;cendants &s;uffered a con&s;iderable change. Be|fore that aera, many men lived above 100 years; but very few now arrive at that age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le voyage d'un Amba&s;&s;adeur de l'Empereur Leopold au Czar Micha&euml;lowits, p. 220.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ingrians and Carelians, who inhabit the northern provinces of Mu&s;covy, and are the na|tives of the country round Peter&s;burg, have vi|gorous and robu&s;t con&s;titutions. Mo&s;t of them have white or fair hair<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See les Nouveaux Memoires &s;ur l'etat de la Grand Ru&s;&s;ie, tom. 2. p. 64.</NOTE>. They re&s;emble the Findlanders, and &s;peak the &s;ame language, which has no affinity to any of the other European tongues.</P>
<P>From the above hi&s;torical account of all the inhabitants of Europe and A&s;ia, it is apparent, that the differences in colour depend much, though not entirely, upon the climates. There are ma|ny other cau&s;es which have an influence upon the colour, and even upon the features and cor|poreal form of different people. The nature of the food is one of the principal cau&s;es; and we &s;hall afterwards con&s;ider the changes it may pro|duce. Manners, or the mode of living, may al&s;o have con&s;iderable effects. A poli&s;hed people, who are accu&s;tomed to an ea&s;y, regular, and tranquil mode of life, and who, by the vigilance <PB N="131" REF="136"> of a wi&s;e government, are removed from the dread of oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;ery, will, for the&s;e rea&s;ons alone, be more &s;trong, vigorous, and hand&s;ome, than &s;avage and lawle&s;s nations, where every individual, deriving no &s;uccours from &s;o|ciety, is obliged to provide for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, to &s;uffer alternately the pangs ari&s;ing from hunger and from &s;urfeits of unwhole&s;ome food, to &s;ink under the fatigues of hard labour, to feel the rigours of a &s;evere climate, without po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the means of alleviating them, to act, in a word, more frequently like a brute than a man. Suppo&s;ing two nations, thus differently circum|&s;tanced, to live under the &s;ame climate, it is rea|&s;onable to think, that the &s;avage people would be more ugly, more tawny, more diminutive, and more wrinkled, than the nation that enjoy|ed the advantages of &s;ociety and civilization. If the former had any &s;uperiority over the latter, it would con&s;i&s;t in the &s;trength, or rather in the hardine&s;s of their bodies. Among the &s;avage people, there might likewi&s;e be fewer examples of lamene&s;s, and of other bodily impediments or deformities. Such men can live, and even mul|tiply, in a poli&s;hed &s;tate, where each individual contributes to the &s;upport of his neighbour, where the &s;trong injure not the feeble, and where the qualities of the body are le&s;s e&s;teemed than tho&s;e of the mind. But, among a &s;avage people, as every individual mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t and defend him|&s;elf by corporeal &s;trength and addre&s;s alone, <PB N="132" REF="137"> tho&s;e who unfortunately come into the world with deformed bodies, or feeble con&s;titutions, fall early victims to the defects of nature.</P>
<P>Three cau&s;es, therefore, mu&s;t be admitted, as concurring in the production of tho&s;e va|rieties which we have remarked among the dif|ferent nations of this earth: 1. The influence of climate; 2. Food, which has a great dependence on climate; and, 3. Manners, on which climate has, perhaps, a &s;till greater influence. But, be|fore we attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h this opinion by rea|&s;oning, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give as minute a de|&s;cription of the inhabitants of Africa and Ame|rica, as we have already given of tho&s;e of Europe and A&s;ia.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned the different na|tions who inhabit the northern part of Africa, from the Mediterranean to the Tropic. All tho&s;e beyond the Tropic, from the Red Sea to the Ocean, an extent of country about 100 or 150 leagues wide, are a &s;pecies of Moors, though &s;o &s;warthy, that they appear to be almo&s;t black. The men, in particular, are exceedingly brown; the women are a little fairer, well-made, and tolerably beautiful. Among tho&s;e Moors, there is a va&s;t number of Mulattoes, who are of a &s;till deeper black; becau&s;e they are born of Negroe women whom the Moors purcha&s;e, and with whom they have many children<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Marmol, tom. 3. p. 29. 33.</NOTE>. Be|yond this territory, under the 17th or 18th de|gree <PB N="133" REF="138"> of north latitude, we find the Negroes of Senegal and of Nubia, both on the coa&s;t of the we&s;tern ocean and that of the Red Sea; and then, from the 18th degree of north to the 18th of &s;outh latitude, the whole inhabitants of Afri|ca, excepting the Ethiopians or Aby&s;&s;inians, are perfectly black. Thus the portion of the globe allotted by Nature to this race of men, contains an extent of territory parallel to the Equator, of about 900 leagues in breadth, and con&s;iderably more in length, e&s;pecially northward of the E|quinoctial line. But, beyond the 18th or 20th degree of &s;outh latitude, the natives are no long|er Negroes, as &s;hall be evinced when we de&s;cribe the Caffres and Hottentots.</P>
<P>We have long been deceived with regard to the colour and features of the Ethiopians, be|cau&s;e they have been confounded with their neighbours the Nubians, who are a different race of people. Marmol tells us, that the Ethiopians are perfectly black, and that they have large faces and flat no&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marmol, tom. 3. p. 68.</NOTE>; and the Dutch travellers give the &s;ame de&s;cription of the&s;e people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Recueil des voy. de la Comp. des Indes de Holl. tom. 4. p. 33.</NOTE>. The truth, however, is, that the Ethiopians differ from the Nubians both in colour and features. The natural colour of the Ethiopians is brown or olive, like that of the &s;outhern Arabs, from whom they probably derive their origin. They are tall, and have regular features, fine eyes, <PB N="134" REF="139"> well proportioned no&s;es, thin lips, and white teeth. But the Nubians have flat no&s;es, thick prominent lips, and their vi&s;ages are extremely black<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, Recueil 4. p. 349.</NOTE>. The&s;e Nubians, like their we&s;tern neighbours, are a &s;pecies of Negroes, very &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e of Senegal.</P>
<P>The Ethiopians are a half poli&s;hed people. They wear garments of cotton and of &s;ilk. Their hou&s;es are low and ill built. In the culture of their lands they are extremely negligent; becau&s;e the citizens and common people are de&s;pi&s;ed, oppre&s;&s;ed, and plundered by the nobles. Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es live &s;eparate from each other in their own villages or hamlets. Their country produces no &s;alt, and the people purcha&s;e it for an equal weight of gold. They are fond of crude meat; and, in their fea&s;ts, the &s;econd cour&s;e, which they regard as the mo&s;t delicate, con&s;i&s;ts of fle&s;h entirely raw. Though they have vines, they make no wine; and their only beverage is a &s;our compo&s;ition of tamarinds and water. They travel on hor&s;es, and u&s;e mules for tran&s;|porting their merchandize. Their knowledge of the arts and &s;ciences is extremely limited; for their language is without rule, and their manner of writing is &s;o imperfect, that they require &s;e|veral days to write an epi&s;tle, though their cha|racters are more beautiful than tho&s;e of the A|rabians<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Voyages de la Comp. de Holl. tom. 4. p. 34.</NOTE>. Their mode of &s;alutation is &s;ingular: <PB N="135" REF="140"> They take one another by the right hand, and mutually apply it to their mouths; the &s;aluter then takes off the &s;carf of the per&s;on he &s;alutes, and wraps it round his own body, by which the other is left half naked; for mo&s;t of the Ethi|opians wear only this &s;carf and a pair of cotton drawers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, recueil 4. p. 349.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Admiral Drake, in his voyage round the world, mentions a fact, which, though &s;ingular, appears not to be incredible. On the frontiers of the de&s;art of Ethiopia, he remarks, there are men called <HI>Acridophagi,</HI> or locu&s;t-ea&s;ters, who are black, meagre, extremely nimble, and of &s;mall &s;tature. In the &s;pring-&s;ea&s;on, infinite num|bers of locu&s;t are tran&s;ported into their country by certain hot winds which blow from the we&s;t. Having neither cattle nor &s;i&s;h, they are obliged to live upon the&s;e locu&s;ts, which they ama&s;s in va&s;t quantities: They cure them with &s;alt, and pre&s;erve them for food during the whole year. This wretched nouri&s;hment produces very &s;trange effects: The people hardly reach the age of 40 years; and, when they approach to this period of life, winged in&s;ects<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The author, in&s;tead of winged in&s;ects, &s;hould have &s;aid caterpillars.</NOTE> are engendered under their &s;kin, which at fir&s;t create a violent itching, and &s;oon multiply &s;o amazingly that their whole fle&s;h &s;warms with them. They begin with de|vouring the belly, then the brea&s;t, and proceed in their ravages till they eat the whole fle&s;h from the bones. Thus are tho&s;e men, whom <PB N="136" REF="141"> nature forces to feed upon in&s;ects, devoured in their turn by them. If this fact were well at|te&s;ted, it would afford ample &s;cope for reflection.</P>
<P>In Ethiopia, and in that tract of land which &s;tretches to Cape Gardufu, there are va&s;t de&s;arts. This country, which may be regarded as the mo&s;t ea&s;terly part of Ethiopia, is almo&s;t entirely uninhabited. To the &s;outh, Ethiopia is bound|ed by the Bedwins, and &s;ome other nations, who ob&s;erve the Mahometan law; a circum&s;tance which corroborates the opinion, that the Ethi|opians have originated from the Arabians. The&s;e two people are only &s;eparated by the Straits of Babelmandel. It is probable, therefore, that the Arabians had formerly invaded Ethiopia, and obliged the natives of that country to retire to the northern parts of Nubia. The Arabians have even &s;pread them&s;elves along the coa&s;ts of Melinda; for the inhabitants of tho&s;e coa&s;ts are only tawny, and follow the religion of Maho|met<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pigafetta, p. 56.</NOTE>. Even in Zanguebar, the natives are not black; mo&s;t of them &s;peak the Arabic language; and they wear cotton &s;tuffs. This country, though under the Torrid Zone, is not exce&s;&s;ive|ly hot; and the hair of the natives is black and cri&s;ped like that of the Negroes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Marmol, p. 107.</NOTE>. Upon the whole of this coa&s;t, as well as at Mo&s;ambique and Madaga&s;car, we meet with &s;ome white men, who, it is alledged, came originally from China, and &s;ettled there, when the Chine&s;e were accu|&s;tomed <PB N="137" REF="142"> to &s;ail over all the ea&s;tern &s;eas, in the &s;ame manner as they are now navigated by the Europeans. Though this opinion be problema|tical, it is certain, that the nations of this ea&s;t|ern coa&s;t of Africa are black, and that the tawny or white people found there have come from o|ther countries.</P>
<P>But, to form a ju&s;t idea of the varieties which occur among the&s;e black nations, requires a more minute examination.</P>
<P>From comparing the te&s;timonies of travellers, it, in the fir&s;t place, appears, that the varieties among the blacks are equally numerous as tho&s;e among the whites. The blacks, as well as the whites, have their Tartars and their Circa&s;&s;ians. The natives of Guiney are extremely ugly, and have an in&s;ufferable odour: Tho&s;e of Sofala and of Mo&s;ambique are beautiful, and have no bad &s;mell. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to divide the blacks into different races; and, I think, they may be reduced to two principal races, that of the Negroes, and that of the Caffres. Under the fir&s;t I comprehend the blacks of Nubia, of Se|negal, of Cape Verd, of Gambia, of Sierra-leo|na, of the Teeth and Gold Coa&s;ts, of that of Juda, Benin, Gabon, Loango, Congo, Angola, and of Benguela, as far as Cape Negro. Under the &s;e|cond, I include all the nations from Cape Ne|gro to the point of Africa, where they a&s;&s;ume the name of <HI>Hottentots,</HI> and all tho&s;e on the ea&s;t|ern coa&s;t, within the &s;ame latitude, as the terri|tories <PB N="138" REF="143"> of Natal, of Sofala, of Monomotapa, of Mo&s;ambique, of Melinda: The blacks of Ma|daga&s;car and of the neighbouring i&s;lands are likewi&s;e Caffres, and not Negroes. The&s;e two races of men have a greater re&s;emblance to each other in colour than in their features, hair, &s;kin, or &s;mell: Their manners and natural di&s;po&s;itions are likewi&s;e very different.</P>
<P>On a clo&s;er examination of the different peo|ple of which each of the&s;e races con&s;i&s;t, we &s;hall find as many varieties among the blacks as a|mong the whites, and an equal number of &s;hades from brown to black, as we have found from brown to white in the other race.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with the countries to the north of Senegal, and, proceeding along the coa&s;ts, we &s;hall con&s;ider the different nations which have been recogni&s;ed and de&s;cribed by travellers. In the fir&s;t place, it is certain, that the natives of the Canary i&s;lands are not Negroes; for we are a&s;|&s;ured by voyagers, that the antient inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands were tall, well made, and of a vigorous complexion; that the women were beautiful, and had fine hair; and that the in|habitants of the &s;outhern parts of each i&s;land were more olive than tho&s;e on the northern parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See I'hi&s;toire de la premiere decouverte des Canaries, par Bentier et Verriere, p. 251.</NOTE>. Duret, in the hi&s;tory of his voyage to Lima<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 72.</NOTE>, informs us, that the antient inhabitants of the i&s;land of Teneriff were tall and robu&s;t, but <PB N="139" REF="144"> meagre and tawny, and that mo&s;t of them had flat no&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des. voyages, par M. I'Abb&eacute; Prevot, tom. 2. p. 230.</NOTE>. The&s;e people, we &s;ee, had nothing in common with the Negroes, excepting the flat no&s;e. The natives of Africa, in the &s;ame lati|tude with the&s;e i&s;lands, are Moors, and very tawny; but, like the i&s;landers, they evidently belong to the race of whites.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Cape Blanc are Moors, and follow the religion of Mahomet. Like the A|rabs, they wander about from place to place, pa&s;turing their hor&s;es, camels, oxen, goats, and &s;heep. They trade with the negroes, who give them eight or ten &s;laves for a hor&s;e, and two or three for a camel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage du le Maire. p. 46.</NOTE>. It is from the&s;e Moors that we have the gum Arabic, which they di&s;&s;olve a|mong their milk. They &s;eldom eat fle&s;h, and never kill their cattle, but when they are about to die of old age or di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Moors are &s;eparated from the Negroes by the river Senegal. They are only tawny, and live on the north &s;ide of this river; but the Negroes who inhabit the &s;outh &s;ide of it are ab|&s;olutely black. The Moors wander through the country; but the Negroes are &s;edentary, and dwell in villages. The former are free and in|dependent; the latter are the &s;laves of tyrants, who oppre&s;s them. The Moors are &s;mall, meagre, and have a pu&s;illanimous a&s;pect; but they are &s;ly and ingenious. The Negroes, on <PB N="140" REF="145"> the contrary, are large, plump, and well made; but they are &s;imple and &s;tupid. In fine, the country inhabited by the Moors con&s;i&s;ts of bar|ren &s;ands, where verdure appears only in very few places. But the Negro country is rich, fer|tile in pa&s;tures, and produces millet, and trees which are always green, but few of them bear fruit fit for food.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, both on the north and &s;outh of the river Senegal, there is a &s;pecies of men called <HI>Foulies,</HI> who &s;eem to form the &s;hade be|tween the Moors and Negroes, and who are, perhaps, Mulattoes, produced by a mixture of the two nations. The&s;e Foulies are not entirely black, like the Negroes; but they are much browner than the Moors, and hold the middle rank between the two. They are likewi&s;e more advanced in civilization than the Negroes; they follow the religion of Mahomet, and are ho&s;pi|table to &s;trangers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage du le Maire, p 75. Marmol, tom. 1. p. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Cape de Verd i&s;lands are peopled with Mulattoes, &s;prung from the Portugueze who fir&s;t &s;ettled there, and the Negroes whom they found on the&s;e i&s;lands. They are called <HI>Copper-co|loured Negroes,</HI> becau&s;e, though they re&s;emble the Negroes in their features, they are le&s;s black, or rather yellowi&s;h. They are hand&s;ome and ingenious; but extremely indolent and idle. They live chiefly by hunting and fi&s;hing. They train their dogs to kill the wild goats, with <PB N="141" REF="146"> which the i&s;lands abound. They deliver their wives and daughters to the embraces of &s;tran|gers, if they chu&s;e to pay for this &s;ingular fa|vour. For pins and other trifles, they &s;ell pa|roquets, porcelain-&s;hells, ambergris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les voyages de Roberts, p. 387. Struys, tom. 1. p. 11.

<P>The fir&s;t genuine Negroes we meet with, are tho&s;e on the &s;outhern banks of the Senegal. The&s;e people, as well as tho&s;e who inhabit the country comprehended between this river and that of Gambia, call them&s;elves <HI>Jaloffs.</HI> They are very black, hand&s;ome, of a fine &s;tature, and their features are not &s;o di&s;agreeable as tho&s;e of the other Negroes. Some of them, and par|ticularly the women, have very regular features. They have the &s;ame ideas of beauty with the Europeans; for they are fond of fine eyes, a &s;mall mouth, thin lips, and a well proportioned no&s;e; they differ only with regard to the ba&s;is of the picture, a very black &s;hining colour being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to form a beauty: Their &s;kin is very fine and &s;oft; and, ab&s;tracting from colour, they have as beautiful women as are to be met with in any other country in the world; their females are generally hand&s;ome, gay, ac|tive, and extremely amorous: They are pecu|liarly fond of white men, whom they care&s;s with ardour, both to &s;atisfy them&s;elves, and in hopes of obtaining pre&s;ents. In their attach|ment to &s;trangers, they meet with no re&s;traint from their hu&s;bands. But, though they offer <PB N="142" REF="147"> their wives, daughters, and &s;i&s;ters to &s;trangers, and conceive their honour to be injured by a refu&s;al, their jealou&s;y ri&s;es to &s;uch a pitch, when their wives tran&s;gre&s;s with men of their own nation, that they often beat, and even cut them|&s;elves with fabres. Tho&s;e women, notwith|&s;tanding, have the tobacco-pipe perpetually in their mouths, and their &s;kin, when they are heated, has a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, though it is not &s;o &s;trong as that of the other Negroes. They love dancing to the &s;ound of the drum and cala|ba&s;h. All their movements in the&s;e dances con|&s;i&s;t of la&s;civious and indecent po&s;tures. They bathe often; and file their teeth, in order to ren|der them more equal. Mo&s;t of the young girls engrave figures of animals, flowers, &amp;c. on their &s;kin.</P>
<P>It is a general practice among the Negroe women, when travelling, to carry their children on their backs. Some have a&s;cribed the flat no&s;e and big bellies of the Negroes to this cau&s;e: The mother, in rai&s;ing the child by &s;udden jerks, makes the child's no&s;e &s;trike again&s;t her back; and the child, to avoid the&s;e frequent blows, keeps its head as far back as po&s;&s;ible, by pu&s;hing its belly forward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Maire, p. 144. Le P&ecirc;re du Jaric, p. 364. et le P&ecirc;re du Tertre, p. 493.</NOTE>. Their hair is black and cri&s;ped, like curled wool. It is by the hair and the colour that they chiefly differ from other men; for their features are not, perhaps, &s;o dif|ferent <PB N="143" REF="148"> from tho&s;e of the Europeans, as the Tar|tarian vi&s;age differs from that of a Frenchman. Father Tertre affirms, that, if mo&s;t of the Ne|groes are flat no&s;ed, it is owing to a general practice of the mothers, who depre&s;s the no&s;es of their children as &s;oon as they come into the world, and &s;queeze their lips to make them thick; and that tho&s;e children, who chance to e&s;cape the&s;e operations, have elevated no&s;es, thin lips, and as fine features as the Europeans. This re|mark, however, is only applicable to the Ne|groes of Senegal, who are the mo&s;t hand&s;ome and mo&s;t beautiful of all the race. Among all the other Negroes, flat no&s;es and thick lips &s;eem to be features be&s;towed on them by nature; The&s;e, in&s;tead of deformities, are regarded as marks of beauty, and &s;upplied by art, when they happen to be denied by nature.</P>
<P>The Negroe women are extremely prolific: They bring forth their children with great ea&s;e, and require no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their labours are followed by no trouble&s;ome con&s;equences; for their &s;trength is fully re&s;tored by a day, or, at mo&s;t, two days repo&s;e. They make excellent nur&s;es, and manage their children with great tenderne&s;s and affection. They are al&s;o more lively and alert than the men; and they even cultivate the virtues of di&s;cretion and temperance. Father Jaric informs us, that the Jaloff Negroe women, in order to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to eat and &s;peak little, fill their mouths with water in <PB N="144" REF="149"> the morning, and keep it there till the hour of breakfa&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See I'Hi&s;t. par P&ecirc;re du Jaric, part 3. p. 365.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Negroes of the i&s;land of Goree, and of the Cape de Verd coa&s;t, like tho&s;e on the banks of the Senegal, are well made, and extremely black. They are &s;o fond of a black &s;hining com|plexion, that they de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch as want this per|fection, in the &s;ame manner as tawny men are de&s;pi&s;ed by the Europeans. Though &s;trong and robu&s;t, they are exceedingly indolent, and culti|vate neither corn, wines, nor fruits. Fi&s;h and millet are their chief articles of food; and they &s;eldom eat fle&s;h. They compare the Europe|ans to hor&s;es, becau&s;e they eat herbs. But they are &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of &s;pirits, that they &s;ell their children, their parents, and even them|&s;elves, for brandy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See le Voy. de M. de Gennes, p. 15.</NOTE>. They go almo&s;t naked, having only a cotton garment which covers them from the middle to about one half of the thigh; and they alledge, that the heat of the climate permits them not to wear any more<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, recueil 11. p. 48.</NOTE>. Their poverty and bad chear, however, hinder them not from being both fat and contented. They believe their country to be the fine&s;t in the univer&s;e; and that they are the hand&s;ome&s;t men in the world, becau&s;e they are the blacke&s;t: If their women betrayed no attachment to the white men, their colour would give them no unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="150"> Though the Negroes of Sierra-leona be not altogether &s;o black as tho&s;e of Senegal, they are not, however, as Struys alledges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tom. 1. p. 22.</NOTE>, of a reddi&s;h or tawny colour. Like the Guiney Negroes, they are of a black le&s;s deep than the natives of Senegal. The general cu&s;tom, among the Ne|groes of Guiney and Sierra-leona, of painting their bodies with red and other colours, might deceive Struys. They likewi&s;e paint a ring round their eyes with white, yellow, or red, and make rays of different colours upon their faces; and many of them cut, upon their &s;kin, figures of plants and of animals. Their women are &s;till more debauched than tho&s;e of Senegal. Many of them are common pro&s;titutes, without incur|ring the &s;malle&s;t di&s;honour. Both men and women keep their heads uncovered; and they &s;have or cut their hair, which is very &s;hort, in various modes. They wear ear-rings made of teeth, &s;hells, horns, bits of wood, &amp;c. which weigh three or four ounces. Some of them pierce their no&s;trils or their upper lip, for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pending &s;imilar ornaments. Their garments con&s;i&s;t of a kind of apron made of the bark of a tree, covered with apes &s;kins; and to the&s;e &s;kins they fix &s;mall bells. They &s;leep upon bull-ru&s;h mats; they eat fi&s;h, or fle&s;h, when they can procure it; but yams and banana's are their principal food<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Indiae Orient. part 2. in qua Johannis Hugonis Lin&s;tcotani &amp;c. navigatio, p. 11.</NOTE>. They <PB N="146" REF="151"> have no pa&s;&s;ion, but for their women, and no inclination to activity or labour. Their hou&s;es are wretched huts. They often continue to live in wild and barren places, though in the neigh|bourhood of rich valleys, hills covered with trees, green and fertile fields, inter&s;ected, in the mo&s;t delightful manner, with rivers and brooks. But their indolence and &s;tupidity make them in&s;en|&s;ible to every plea&s;ure of this nature. The roads which lead from one place to another are general|ly twice as long as they ought; but they attempt not to render them &s;horter; and, though the means were pointed out to them, they never think of taking the &s;horte&s;t road, but mechani|cally follow the beaten track, and are not an|xious about lo&s;ing time, which they have no mode of mea&s;uring.</P>
<P>Though the Guiney Negroes enjoy good health, and have vigorous con&s;titutions, they &s;eldom reach old age. A Negro of 50 years is a very old man. Their premature commerce with the women is, perhaps, the cau&s;e of the brevity of their lives. Their children, when very young, are allowed to commit every &s;pe|cies of debauchery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Voy. de Guin&eacute;e par Guill. Bo&s;man, p. 143.</NOTE>; and nothing is &s;o rare a|mong the&s;e people as to find a girl who can remember the time when &s;he cea&s;ed to be a vir|gin.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of St Thomas, of Annobona, &amp;c. are inhabited by Negroes &s;imilar to tho&s;e on the <PB N="147" REF="152"> neighbouring continent; but their numbers are few; becau&s;e the Europeans have cha&s;ed them of&s;, and retained only &s;uch as they reduced to &s;lavery. Both men and women go naked, ex|cepting a &s;mall apron round their middle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pyrard, p. 16.</NOTE>. Mandel&s;lo alledges that the Europeans who &s;et|tle in the i&s;land of St Thomas, which is but a degree and a half from the Equator, pre&s;erve their whitene&s;s till the third generation; and he &s;eems to in&s;inuate that they turn black after that period. But it is not probable that this change can be &s;o &s;uddenly effected.</P>
<P>The Negroes on the coa&s;ts of Juda and Arada, are le&s;s black than tho&s;e of Senegal, Guiney, and Congo. They prefer the fle&s;h of dogs to all o|ther meat, a roa&s;ted dog being generally the fir&s;t di&s;h pre&s;ented at their fea&s;ts. This ta&s;te is not peculiar to the Negroes; the &s;avages of North America, and &s;ome Tartarian nations are equally fond of dogs fle&s;h.

<P>Pigafetta, and Drake who &s;eems to copy him verbatim, inform us, that the Negroes of Congo are black, but le&s;s &s;o than tho&s;e of Senegal. Their hair is generally black and cri&s;ped, though in &s;ome it is red. The men are of a middle &s;ta|ture; in &s;ome, the eyes are brown; in others, they are of a &s;ea-green colour.

<P>In certain provinces of Congo, they have very &s;ingular cu&s;toms. When a per&s;on dies in Lo|ango, for example, they place the corp&s;e on a kind of amphitheatre, rai&s;ed about &s;ix feet above the ground, and in a &s;itting po&s;ture, with the hands re&s;ting on the knees. They dre&s;s him in his be&s;t garments, and then kindle fires all round the body. In proportion as the cloaths ab&s;orb the moi&s;ture, they cover him with fre&s;h gar|ments, till the body be perfectly dry; after which, they bury him with great pomp. In the province of Malimba, the wife ennobles the hu&s;|band. When the King dies, and leaves only a &s;ingle daughter, if &s;he has arrived at the age of puberty, &s;he becomes ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of the kingdom. She begins her reign by making a tour round her dominions. In all the towns and villages through which &s;he pa&s;&s;es, the whole men are obliged to appear before her, immedi|ately upon her arrival, and &s;he choo&s;es the man whom &s;he fancies mo&s;t to pa&s;s the night with her. At her return from her journey, &s;he &s;ends for the man who has been &s;o fortunate as to plea&s;e her be&s;t, and in&s;tantly marries him. After marriage, her power terminates, and devolves en|tirely on her hu&s;band. The&s;e facts I have ex|tracted <PB N="149" REF="154"> from M. de la Bro&s;&s;e's travels along the coa&s;t of Angola in the year 1738. He adds a fact not le&s;s &s;ingular. 'The&s;e Negroes,' &s;ays he, 'are extremely vindictive, of which I &s;hall give a convincing proof. They daily demand|ed of us &s;ome brandy for the u&s;e of the King and chief men of the town. One day this re|que&s;t was denied, and we had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent it; for all the French and Engli&s;h of|ficers having gone a fi&s;hing on a &s;mall lake near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, they erected a tent for the purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing and eating the fi&s;h they had caught. When they were amu&s;ing them|&s;elves after their repa&s;t, &s;even or eight Negroes, who were the chiefs of Loango, arrived in &s;e|dans, and pre&s;ented their hands, according to the cu&s;tom of the country. The&s;e Negroes privately rubbed the officers hands with a &s;ub|tile poi&s;on, which acts in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; and, accordingly, five Captains, and three &s;urgeons, died on the &s;pot,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>When the Negroes of Congo have a pain in their head, or any other place of the body, they make a &s;mall wound in the place affected, and apply to it a &s;mall horn with a hole in its mid|dle, by means of which they &s;uck out the blood till the pain abates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pigafetta, p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Negroes of Senegal, of Gambia, of Cape de Verd, of Angola, and of Congo, are of a finer black than tho&s;e of the coa&s;ts of Juda, I&s;|&s;igni, <PB N="150" REF="155"> Arada, and the adjacent provinces. When in health, they are all black; but, when &s;ick, they become yellowi&s;h, or copper-coloured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nouveaux voy. aux ifles de l'Amerique, tom. 4. p. 138.</NOTE>. In the French i&s;lands, the Negroes of Angola are preferred, for their &s;trength, to tho&s;e of Cape de Verd: But, when heated, they &s;mell &s;o rank, that the places they pa&s;s through are infected with the &s;tench for more than a quarter of an hour. The Cape de Verd Negroes do not &s;mell nearly &s;o &s;trong as tho&s;e of Angola: They have al&s;o a finer and blacker &s;kin; they are better made; their features are &s;ofter; their di&s;po&s;itions are more gentle; and their &s;tature is more com|modious
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'hi&s;t des Antilles, par le P&ecirc;re du Tertre, p. 493.</NOTE>. The Negroes of Guiney are very proper for cultivating the ground and other la|borious offices. Tho&s;e of Senegal are not &s;o &s;trong; but they are more ingenious, and better adapted for dome&s;tic &s;ervices<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nouveaux voy. aux i&s;les, tom. 4. p. 116.</NOTE>. Father Charle|voix tells us, that the Senegal Negroes are the mo&s;t hand&s;ome, mo&s;t docile, and be&s;t &s;uited for dome&s;tic u&s;es; that the Bambaras are larger, but that they are all rogues; that the Aradas are be&s;t acquainted with the culture of the earth; that the Congos are the &s;malle&s;t in &s;ize, and ex|cellent fi&s;hers, but that they are much addicted to de&s;ertion; that the Nagos are the mo&s;t hu|mane, the Mondongos the mo&s;t cruel, the Mi|mes the mo&s;t re&s;olute, mo&s;t capricious, and mo&s;t &s;ubject to de&s;pair; and that the Creole Negroes, <PB N="151" REF="156"> from whatever nations they derive their origin, retain nothing of their parents but the colour and the &s;pirit of &s;lavery. They are more inge|nious, rational, and dexterous, but more &s;loth|ful and debauched, than the African Negroes. He adds, that the genius of all the Guiney Ne|groes is extremely limited; that &s;ome of them appear to be perfectly &s;tupid, not being able to count, beyond the number of three; that they never think &s;pontaneou&s;ly; that they have no memory, the pa&s;t and the future being equally unknown to them; that the mo&s;t &s;prightly of them have &s;ome humour, and make tolerable mimics; that they are extremely cunning, and would rather die than tell a &s;ecret; that, in ge|neral, they are gentle, humane, docile, &s;imple, credulous, and even &s;uper&s;titious; and that they are faithful, and brave, and, if properly di&s;cipli|ned, would make good &s;oldiers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de St Dominique, par le P&ecirc;re Charlevoix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the Negroes have little genius, their feelings are extremely acute. According to the manner they are treated, they are gay or me|lancholy, laborious or &s;lothful, friends or ene|mies. When well fed, and not maletreated, they are contented, joyous, ready for every employ|ment, and the &s;atisfaction of their mind is paint|ed in their countenance. But, when oppre&s;&s;ed and abu&s;ed, they grow peevi&s;h, and often die of melancholy. Of benefits and of abu&s;e, they are exceedingly &s;en&s;ible, and again&s;t tho&s;e who <PB N="152" REF="157"> injure them they bear a mortal hatred. On the other hand, when they contract an affection to a ma&s;ter, there is no office, however hazardous, which they will not boldy execute, to demon|&s;trate their zeal and attachment. They are na|turally affectionate, and have an ardent love to their children, friends, and countrymen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Antilles, p. 483.</NOTE>. The little they po&s;&s;e&s;s they freely di&s;tribute among the nece&s;&s;itous, without any other motive than that of pure compa&s;&s;ion for the indigent.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is apparent, that the un|fortunate Negroes are endowed with excellent hearts, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;eeds of every human virtue. I cannot write their hi&s;tory, without lamenting their mi&s;erable condition. Is it not more than enough to reduce men to &s;lavery, and to oblige them to labour perpetually, with|out the capacity of acquiring property? To the&s;e, is it nece&s;&s;ary to add cruelty, and blows, and to abu&s;e them wor&s;e than brutes? Huma|nity revolts again&s;t tho&s;e odious oppre&s;&s;ions which re&s;ult from avarice, and which would have been daily renewed, had not the laws given a friend|ly check to the brutality of ma&s;ters, and fixed limits to the &s;ufferings of their &s;laves. They are forced to labour; and yet the coar&s;e&s;t food is dealt out to them with a &s;paring hand. They &s;upport, &s;ay their obdurate ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, hunger without inconvenience; a &s;ingle European meal is &s;ufficient provi&s;ion to a Negro for three days; however little they eat or &s;leep, they are always <PB N="153" REF="158"> equally &s;trong, and equally fit for labour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de St Dominique, p. 468.</NOTE>. How can men, in who&s;e brea&s;ts a &s;ingle &s;enti|ment of humanity remains unextingui&s;hed, adopt &s;uch dete&s;table maxims? How dare they, by &s;uch barbarous and diabolical arguments, attempt to palliate tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions which originate &s;ole|ly from their thir&s;t of gold? But, let us aban|don tho&s;e hardened mon&s;ters to perpetual infa|my, and return to our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Of the inhabitants of the coa&s;ts and of the in|terior parts of Africa, from Cape Negro to Cape de Voltes, an extent of about 400 leagues, we have no knowledge. We only know, that the&s;e men are le&s;s black than the other Negroes, and that they re&s;emble the Hottentots, with whom they border on the &s;outh. The Hottentots, on the contrary, are well known, and de&s;cribed by almo&s;t every voyager. They are not Negroes, but Caffres, and would be only of a tawny co|lour, if they did not blacken their &s;kin with grea&s;e and paint. M. Kolbe, who has given a very accurate de&s;cription of the&s;e people, regards them, however, as Negroes. He a&s;&s;ures us, that they have all &s;hort, black, frizled, woolly hair; and that he never &s;aw a &s;ingle Hottentot with long hair<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne E&s;perance, par M. Kolbe, p. 95.</NOTE>. But this circum&s;tance is not &s;uffi|cient to make us con&s;ider them as genuine Ne|groes. In the fir&s;t place, their colour is totally different; for M. Kolbe tells us, that they are <PB N="154" REF="159"> olive, and never black, though they employ e|very method to darken their &s;kin. In the next place, it &s;eems to be equally difficult to pronounce concerning their hair; for they never either comb or wa&s;h it, but daily rub on their heads va&s;t quantities of grea&s;e, &s;oot, and du&s;t, which make their hair re&s;emble a fleece of wool &s;tuffed with dirt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne E&s;perance, par. M. Kolbe, p. 92.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, their di&s;po&s;itions are dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the Negroes. The latter are &s;edentary, love cleanline&s;s, and are ea&s;ily re|conciled to &s;ervitude. The Hottentots, on the contrary, are a wandering, independent people, frightfully na&s;ty, and extremely jealous of their liberty. The&s;e differences are more than &s;ufficient to convince us that the Hottentots are not of the &s;ame race with the Negroes.</P>
<P>Gama, who fir&s;t doubled the Cape of Good Hope, arrived in the Bay of St Helena on the 4th of November 1497. He de&s;cribes the inhabitants as being black, of &s;mall &s;tature, and having a very di&s;agreeable a&s;pect: But he &s;ays not that they were naturally black like the Negroes; and, doubtle&s;s, they only &s;eemed black to him by the grea&s;e and &s;oot with which they are perpetually covered. This voyager adds, that the &s;ound of their voice re&s;embled &s;ighing; that they were clothed in the &s;kins of bea&s;ts; and that their arms were, bludgeons hardened with the fire, and pointed with the horn of &s;ome animal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voy. par l'Alb&eacute; Prevot, tom. 1. p. 22.</NOTE>. It is <PB N="155" REF="160"> apparent, therefore, that the Hottentots practi&s;e no arts in common with the Negroes.</P>
<P>We are informed by the Dutch voyagers, that the &s;avages to the north of the Cape are &s;maller than the Europeans; that their colour is a red|di&s;h brown; that they are extremely ugly, and endeavour to increa&s;e their blackne&s;s with paint; and that their hair re&s;embles that of a man who has hung long on a gibbet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de la Comp. de Hollande, p. 218.</NOTE>. In another place, they tell us, that the Hottentots are of the colour of Mulattoes; that their vi&s;age is greatly de|formed; that they are of a middle &s;ize, but meagre, and exceedingly nimble in the chace; and that their language re&s;embles the clucking of a Turkey cock<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Spit&s;berg, p. 443.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="156" REF="161"> From all the&s;e te&s;timonies, it is plain that the Hottentots are not true Negroes, but blacks be|ginning to approach towards whitene&s;s, as the Moors are whites approaching to blackne&s;s. The&s;e Hottentots, moreover, are a very &s;ingular &s;pecies of &s;avages. Their women, who are com|monly much le&s;s than the men, have a kind of excre&s;cence, or hard broad &s;kin, which originates above the os pubis, and de&s;cends, like an apron, to the middle of their thighs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See De&s;cript. du Cap. par.

Thevenot &s;ays the &s;ame thing of the Egyptian women, but that, in&s;tead of allowing this excre&s;cence to grow, they burn it off with hot irons. With regard to the women of Egypt, the fact is very doubtful. But it is certain, that all the women who are natives of the Cape are &s;ubject to this mon&s;trous defor|mity, which they uncover to tho&s;e who have the curio&s;ity to look at it. The men are all half eunuchs, not naturally, but by an ab&s;urd cu&s;tom of cutting out one of the te&s;ticles about the age of eight years. M. Kolbe &s;aw this operation performed on a young Hottentot. The circum|&s;tances with which this ceremony is accompa|nied are &s;o &s;ingular that they de&s;erve to be re|cited.</P>
<P>After rubbing the young man with grea&s;e taken from the entrails of a &s;heep which is &s;lain for the purpo&s;e, they lay him on his back on the ground, tie his hands and his feet, and three or four of his friends hold him. Then the prie&s;t, <PB N="157" REF="162">
(for it is a religious rite), armed with a &s;harp knife, makes an inci&s;ion, and cuts away the left te&s;ticle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tavernier &s;ays it is the right, tom. 4. p. 297.</NOTE>, and puts in its place a ball of grea&s;e of the &s;ame &s;ize, prepared with &s;ome medicinal herbs. He then &s;ews up the wound with the bone of a &s;mall bird, which &s;erves for a needle, and a thread made of the tendon of a &s;heep. The operation being thus fini&s;hed, the patient is untied. But the prie&s;t, before quitting him, rubs him all over with the warm grea&s;e of a new-killed &s;heep, or rather pours the grea&s;e up|on him &s;o copiou&s;ly, that, when cool, it forms a kind of cru&s;t. At the &s;ame time, he rubs him &s;o roughly, that the young man, who has al|ready &s;uffered too much, is covered with &s;weat, and fumes like a capon on a &s;pit. The opera|tor next makes furrows with his nails in this cru&s;t of grea&s;e, from one end of the body to a|nother, and then pi&s;&s;es in them. After which, he again rubs the patient, and fills up the fur|rows with fre&s;h grea&s;e. The young man is now in&s;tantly abandoned, and left alone in a condition rather re&s;embling death than life: He is obliged to crawl, in the be&s;t manner he can, into a hut purpo&s;ely erected near the place where the ope|ration is performed. There he either peri&s;hes or recovers, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or any other nou|ri&s;hment than the grea&s;e that covers him, and which he may lick, if he chu&s;es.

<P>All the Hottentots have broad flat no&s;es, which would not be the ca&s;e, if their mothers did not flatten them immediately after birth; for they regard a prominent no&s;e as a great defor|mity. They have al&s;o very thick lips, white teeth, bu&s;hy eye-brows, large heads, meagre bodies, and &s;mall limbs. They &s;eldom live above 40 years. The &s;hort duration of their lives is unque&s;tionably occa&s;ioned by the na&s;tine&s;s in which they perpetually wallow, and the putrid fle&s;h on which they chiefly feed. As mo&s;t tra|vellers have written fully concerning the man|ners of this dirty people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader may con&s;ult the following voyagers: Kolbe; voy. de la Comp.

<P>Along the African coa&s;t, beyond the Cape of Good Hope, we meet with the territory of Natal, <PB N="159" REF="164"> the inhabitants of which differ greatly from the Hottentots.

But, like the Hottentots, they have &s;ome ta&s;te for grea&s;e; for they wear bonnets made of the tal|low of oxen. The&s;e bonnets are from eight to ten inches high, and they &s;pend a good deal of time in preparing them: For this purpo&s;e, the tallow mu&s;t be well refined; they apply but little of it at a time, and mingle it &s;o compleatly with their hair, that it never falls off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier, tom. 2. p. 393.</NOTE>. M. Kolbe alledges, that their no&s;es are flat from their birth, and that they u&s;e no arts to flatten them; that they do not &s;tammer, or &s;trike the palate with their tongue, like the Hottentots; that they build hou&s;es, cultivate the ground, and &s;ow a &s;pecies of maize or Turki&s;h corn, of which they make ale, a drink unknown to the Hottentots<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap. tom. 1. p. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Beyond the territory of Natal, we meet with tho&s;e of Sofala and Monomotapa. According to Pigafetta, the people of Sofala are black, but tal|ler and thicker than the other Caffres. This au|thor places the Amazones in the neighbourhood of the kingdom of Sofala<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Indiae Orient. part. 1. p. 54.</NOTE>. But nothing can be more uncertain than what has been affirmed with regard to tho&s;e female warriors. The na|tives <PB N="160" REF="165"> of Monomotapa, &s;ay the Dutch travellers, are tall, hand&s;ome, black, and have fine com|plexions. The young girls go naked, wearing only a thin piece of cotton &s;tuff upon their middle; but put on garments as &s;oon as they get hu&s;bands. The&s;e people, though very black, are different from the Negroes. Their features are neither &s;o coar&s;e nor &s;o ugly; their bodies have no bad &s;mell; and they can neither &s;up|port &s;ervitude nor hard labour. Father Charle|voix tells us, that he has &s;een blacks of Mono|motapa and Madaga&s;car in America; but that they could never be trained to labour, and &s;oon peri&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de St Dominique, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The natives of Madaga&s;car and of Mo&s;ambique, are more or le&s;s black. The inhabitants of Madaga&s;car have the hair on the crown of their heads not &s;o much cri&s;ped as tho&s;e of Mo&s;am|bique. Neither of them are true Negroes; and, though tho&s;e on the coa&s;t are very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the Portugue&s;e, the people in the interior parts of the continent are extremely &s;avage, and jea|lous of their liberty. Both men and women go perfectly naked; they eat the fle&s;h of elephants, and &s;ell the ivory to &s;trangers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Recueil des Voyages, tom 3. p. 623.; Le Voy. de Moquet, p. 265.; et La Navigation de Jean Hugues Lint&s;cot, p. 20.</NOTE>. Madaga&s;car is chiefly inhabited by blacks and whites, who, though very tawney, &s;eem to be a different race of men. The hair of the former is black and <PB N="161" REF="166"> cri&s;ped; that of the latter is fairer, le&s;s frizled, and longer. It is a common opinion, that the&s;e whites derive their origin from the Chine&s;e. But Francis Cauche properly remarks, that they &s;eem to be of European extraction; for he a&s;|&s;ures us, that all of them he &s;aw had neither flat faces nor no&s;es, like the Chine&s;e. He likewi&s;e &s;ays, that the&s;e whites are fairer than the Ca&s;til|lans; that their hair is long; that the blacks are not flat-no&s;ed like tho&s;e on the continent; and that their lips are thin. In this i&s;land there are al&s;o many per&s;ons of an olive or tawny co|lour, who probably proceed from a mixture of the blacks and whites. The &s;ame traveller in|forms us, that the inhabitants round the bay of St Augu&s;tine are tawny; that they have no beard; that their hair is long and &s;mooth; that they are tall and hand&s;ome; and, la&s;tly, that they are all circumci&s;ed, though they probably never heard of the law of Mahomet, for they have neither temples, mo&s;ques, nor religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Fran&ccedil;ois Cauche, p. 45.</NOTE>.

They eat their meat almo&s;t raw, and devour the &s;kins of their oxen, after &s;inging the hair; they likewi&s;e eat the wax with the honey. The common people go almo&s;t naked; but the more opulent wear drawers or petticoats of cotton and &s;ilk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage de Flacour, p. 90.; Struys, tom. 1. p. 32.

<P>The natives of the interior parts of Africa are too little known to admit of de&s;cription. Tho&s;e called <HI>Zingues</HI> by the Arabians are black, and almo&s;t perfectly &s;avage. Marmol tell us, that they multiply prodigiou&s;ly, and would over-run the adjacent country, if numbers of them were not &s;wept off, from time to time, by a great mortality occa&s;ioned by hot winds.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears, that the Negroes are a different &s;pecies of Blacks from the Caffres. But, from the de&s;criptions we have given, it is &s;till more apparent, that the differences of colour are produced by the climate; and that the pe|culiarities in features depend much upon the cu&s;toms which take place among different nations, &s;uch as, flattening the no&s;e, pulling the hair off the eye-brows, lengthening the ears, thickening the <PB N="163" REF="168"> lips, making the face broad, &amp;c. Nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the influence of climate upon colour, than to find, under the &s;ame lati|tude, and di&s;tinct from each other more than 1000 leagues, people &s;o &s;imilar as the Nubians and natives of Senegal; and to find, that the Hottentots, who mu&s;t have originated from a black race, are the white&s;t people in Africa, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e their country is the colde&s;t. If the tawny nation on one &s;ide of the river Senegal, and the perfect blacks on the o|ther, occur as an objection, I mu&s;t refer to what was above remarked concerning the effects of food, which has a great influence on colour, as well as many other cu&s;toms and modes of li|ving: And, if an example be demanded, I &s;hall produce one from the brute creation, which e|very man is in a condition to verify. The fle&s;h of the hares that live in the plains and moi&s;t grounds, is whiter than that of tho&s;e which inha|bit mountainous or dry regions; and, even in the &s;ame part of the country, tho&s;e that feed in the meadows are perfectly different from tho&s;e that dwell on the hills. The colour of the fle&s;h proceeds from that of the blood and other hu|mours of the body, the qualities of which ne|ce&s;&s;arily depend on the nature of the food.</P>
<P>The origin of black men has, at all times, been an object of inquiry. The antients, who know only tho&s;e of Nubia, regarded them as the la&s;t or terminating &s;hade of the tawny colour, <PB N="164" REF="169"> and confounded them with the Ethiopians, and other African nations, who, though extremely brown, belong more to the white than to the black race. They thought that the differences of colour among the human &s;pecies proceeded &s;olely from the varieties of climate, and that blackne&s;s was occa&s;ioned by a perpetual expo|&s;ure to the hot rays of the &s;un. This opinion, though very probable, was much weakened, af|ter it was di&s;covered that the inhabitants of more &s;outhern climates, and even under the E|quator it&s;elf, as tho&s;e of Melinda and Mo&s;am|bique, were not black, but very tawny; and when it was farther di&s;covered, that blacks tran&s;|ported into more temperate climates, lo&s;t nothing of their original hue, but communicated it to their de&s;cendants. If we attend, however, to the migrations of different people, and to the time nece&s;&s;ary to produce a change in their co|lour, we &s;hall, perhaps, find the opinion of the antients to have been well founded; for the na|tives of this part of Africa are Nubians, and will pre&s;erve their original blackne&s;s as long as they continue to live under the &s;ame climate, and mix not with the whites. But the Ethiopians, the Aby&s;&s;inians, and even the natives of Melinda, though they derive their origin from the whites, their religion and cu&s;toms being the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Arabians, are, however, more tawny than the inhabitants of the &s;outhern parts of A|rabia. This circum&s;tance alone evinces, that, <PB N="165" REF="170"> even among the &s;ame race of men, the different degrees of blackne&s;s depend, more or le&s;s, upon the heat of the climate. Many ages are, per|haps, nece&s;&s;ary to change the white colour into perfect blackne&s;s; but it is probable, that, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, a white people, tran&s;|ported from the north to the Equator, would undergo this change, e&s;pecially if they adopted the manners, and u&s;ed the food of the new country.</P>
<P>The objection drawn from the difference of features is not un&s;urmountable; for the features of a Negro, who has not been purpo&s;ely de|formed in his infancy, differ not more from tho&s;e of an European, than a Tartar differs from a Chine&s;e, or a Circa&s;&s;ian from a Greek: And, with regard to the hair, the nature of it depends &s;o much on the quality of the &s;kin, that any differences which take place in it ought to be con|&s;idered as merely accidental; for, in the &s;ame country, and even in the &s;ame village, we find every po&s;&s;ible variety of hair. In France, for example, there are &s;ome men who&s;e hair is as &s;hort and as cri&s;ped as that of a Negro: Be&s;ides, heat and cold have great influence upon the co|lour of the hair both of men and other animals. In the northern regions, black hair is &s;eldom or never &s;een: And &s;quirrels, hares, wea&s;els, and &s;everal other animals, are white in the north, but brown or gray in more &s;outhern latitudes. The effects produced by cold and heat are even <PB N="166" REF="171"> &s;o remarkable, that, in Sweden, certain animals as the hares, are gray during the &s;ummer, and perfectly white in winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lepus apud nos ae&s;tate cinereus, hieme &s;emper albus; Linnaei Faun. Succ. p. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the New World affording no examples of true Blacks, is the &s;tronge&s;t argument again&s;t my hypothe&s;is; and it appears, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be almo&s;t in&s;uperable. If blackne&s;s were the effect of heat alone, why do we not find Negroes or black men in the Antilles, in Mexico, in San|ta-f&eacute;, in Guiana, in the country of the Ama|zones, or in Peru; &s;ince the&s;e countries of A|merica are &s;ituated under the &s;ame latitude with Senegal, Guiney, and Angola in Africa? If the different colours of the human &s;pecies were oc|ca&s;ioned by the climate, or the di&s;tance from the Pole, we &s;hould have found, in the Bra&s;ils, in Paraguay, or in Chili, men &s;imilar to the Caf|fres and Hottentots. But, before attempting to remove this objection, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort de&s;cription of the various American na|tions; after which we &s;hall be the more quali|fied to make ju&s;t compari&s;ons, and to draw ge|neral conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t northerly regions of America, we find a &s;pecies of Laplanders, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Europe, or to the Samoiedes of A&s;ia. Though their numbers are few, they are &s;pread over a large extent of country. Tho&s;e who live round Davis's Straits, are &s;mall, of an olive colour, and <PB N="167" REF="172"> have &s;hort thick limbs. They are excellent fi&s;hers, and eat their meat and fi&s;h raw. Their drink is pure water, or the blood of the &s;ea-dog. They are very robu&s;t, and long-lived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. des I&s;les, p. 189.</NOTE>. The&s;e are exactly the figure, colour, and manners of the Laplanders: And, what is &s;ingular, as the Fins, who are adjacent to the European Lap|landers, are white, beautiful, and pretty large and hand&s;ome; &s;o, in the neighbourhood of the American Laplanders, we find a &s;pecies of men, who are tall, hand&s;ome, pretty white, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of very regular features<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The &s;avages along Hud&s;on's Bay, and to the north of Labra|dor, though they are &s;mall, ill made, and ugly, appear not to be of the &s;ame race with the for|mer. Their vi&s;age is almo&s;t entirely covered with hair, like the &s;avages of the lands of Je&s;&s;o, to the north of Japan. In &s;ummer they dwell in tents made of the &s;kins of the rein-deer; and, in winter, they live under ground, like the Lap|landers and Samoiedes, where they lie promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly, and without ceremony. Though their food con&s;i&s;ts only of raw fle&s;h and fi&s;h, they live very long<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Rob. Lade, tom. 2. p. 309.</NOTE>. The &s;avages of Newfoundland re&s;emble tho&s;e of Davis's Straits. They are of &s;mall &s;tature, have little or no beard, broad faces, large eyes, and generally flat no&s;es.

<P>To the &s;outh of the&s;e &s;avages, who are &s;pread over the northern regions of America, we meet with a different and more numerous race, who occupy Canada, and the adjacent territories, as far as the A&s;&s;iniboils. They are large, &s;trong, well made, and all of them have black hair, black eyes, very white teeth, a &s;warthy colour, little beard, and hardly any hair on their bodies. They are indefatigable in travelling, and ex|tremely nimble in the chace. With equal ea&s;e they can &s;upport hunger, and the greate&s;t exce&s;s in eating. They are hardy, bold, grave, and moderate: In a word, they have &s;o &s;trong a re|&s;emblance, both in their external appearance, and in their manners and di&s;po&s;itions, to the oriental Tartars, that, if they were not &s;eparated by a va&s;t &s;ea, we would believe them to have &s;prung from the &s;ame nation. They al&s;o live under the &s;ame latitude; which is a farther proof of the influence of climate upon the figure and colour of the human &s;pecies. To conclude, in the northern extremities of the New Continent, as well as in tho&s;e of the old, we fir&s;t find men &s;imilar to the Laplanders, and likewi&s;e a race of whites with fair hair, like the inhabitants of the north of Europe; then hairy men re&s;embling the &s;avages of Je&s;&s;o; and, la&s;tly, the &s;avages of Canada, who occupy the whole territory as far <PB N="169" REF="174"> as the Gulf of Mexico, and &s;o &s;trongly re&s;emble the Tartars, that, if there were no embarra&s;&s;ment concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of their migration, we would conclude them to be the very &s;ame peo|ple. However, if we attend to the &s;mall num|ber of men &s;cattered over the immen&s;e territories of North America, and their univer&s;al want of civilization, we mu&s;t admit that all the&s;e nations of &s;avages have been peopled by the e&s;cape of individuals from &s;ome more numerous race. Though we &s;hould allow the number of natives to be now reduced to a twentieth part of what they were on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, &s;till this country was even then &s;o thinly inhabited, that it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a de&s;art, or a land &s;o recently peopled, that the men had not time &s;ufficient for an exten&s;ive multiplication. M. Fabry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. gen. et particul. tom. 1. p. 340.</NOTE>, who penetrated farther into the interi|or parts of this country, to the northwe&s;t of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, than any other man had done, and where, of cour&s;e, the &s;avages could not have &s;uffered any diminution by the inroads of the Europeans, a&s;&s;ures us, that he often travelled in this region 200 leagues without &s;eeing a human face, or any marks which indicated the adjacent country to be inhabited; and that, when he did meet with any Indian huts, they were always at lea&s;t 100 leagues di&s;tant from each other, and &s;eldom contained above 20 per&s;ons. Along the banks of rivers and lakes, it is true, the &s;avages <PB N="170" REF="175"> are more numerous, and &s;ome of them are even trouble&s;ome to our coloni&s;ts. But the&s;e nations &s;eldom exceed three or four thou&s;and per&s;ons, and are &s;pread over a country often more ex|ten&s;ive than the kingdom of France: So that I am per&s;uaded there are more men in Paris than all the natives of North America, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northern Ocean, though this territory is much larger than Europe.</P>
<P>Population depends more on &s;ociety than Na|ture. Men would not be comparatively &s;o nu|merous as the &s;avage animals, if they were not united, and derived not mutual aid and &s;uccour from &s;ociety. In North America, the bi&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;pecies of wild ox.</NOTE> are perhaps more abundant than the men. But, though population be a re&s;ult of &s;ociety, it is the increa&s;ed number of men which nece&s;&s;arily pro|duces their unity. We may, therefore, pre&s;ume, that the want of civilization in America is owing to the paucity of its inhabitants; for, though each nation had peculiar cu&s;toms and manners, though &s;ome were more &s;avage, cruel, and da|&s;tardly than others; yet they were all equally &s;tupid, ignorant, and de&s;titute of arts and of in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>I have run, perhaps, into too great a detail concerning the manners of &s;avage nations. Mo&s;t authors have mi&s;taken the particular actions of individuals, which often re&s;ult from caprice or unknown circum&s;tances, for the general and <PB N="171" REF="176"> e&s;tabli&s;hed manners of a nation. Some people, they tell us, eat their enemies; others burn or maim them; &s;ome delight in war; others love peace. Some kill their parents after they arrive at a certain age; among others, the fathers and mothers eat their own children. The&s;e, and &s;i|milar narrations, &s;o much delighted in by tra|vellers, are reducible to &s;ingle facts, and import no more than that one individual &s;avage eat his enemy, another burned or maimed him, and a third killed or eat his own child. All the&s;e ex|amples may be found in every &s;avage nation; for a people who live without the re&s;traint of fixed laws, or of a regular government, can only be con&s;idered as a tumultuous a&s;&s;emblage of bar|barous and independent individuals, who obey no laws but tho&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and caprice, and who, having no common intere&s;t, are incapable of pur&s;uing any determined &s;tandard of manners, which &s;uppo&s;es general views that have obtained the &s;anction both of time and a majority of numbers.</P>
<P>A nation, it may be &s;aid, is compo&s;ed of men who are known to each other, who &s;peak the &s;ame language, who unite, when nece&s;&s;ary, un|der the &s;ame chief, who u&s;e the &s;ame arms, and who paint them&s;elves with the &s;ame colours: To this we might &s;ub&s;cribe, without difficulty, if the&s;e manners were con&s;tant and uniform; if the people did not often unite and &s;eparate with|out de&s;ign; if their chief lo&s;t not all authority <PB N="172" REF="177"> by their caprice or his own; and if their lan|guage was not &s;o &s;imple as to be almo&s;t common to every tribe.</P>
<P>As they have but few ideas, their expre&s;&s;ions are limited to the mo&s;t common objects; and, though every mode of expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould differ from another; yet the &s;mallne&s;s of their number nece&s;&s;arily renders them of ea&s;y acqui&s;ition. It is not, therefore, &s;o difficult for a &s;avage to learn the language of all other &s;avages, as for a poli&s;h|ed man to learn the language of another people equally advanced in civilization.</P>
<P>But it is, perhaps, of more importance to exa|mine the nature of the individual &s;avage, than to enlarge upon the manners and cu&s;toms of the&s;e pretended nations. Of all animals, a &s;a|vage man is the mo&s;t &s;ingular, the lea&s;t known, and the mo&s;t difficult to de&s;cribe. We are &s;o ill qualified to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine gifts of Nature from what is acquired by education, art, and imitation, that it would not be &s;urpri&s;ing if we &s;hould totally mi&s;take the real portrait of a &s;avage, though the natural colouring and features of his character were faithfully repre&s;ented to us.</P>
<P>An ab&s;olute &s;avage, &s;uch as the boy brought up by the bear, de&s;cribed by Conor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Evang. Med. p. 133.</NOTE>, the young man found in the fore&s;t of Hanover, or the girl di&s;covered in the woods of France, would be a curious object to a philo&s;opher, by the contem|plation of which he might e&s;timate the force of <PB N="173" REF="178"> natural appetites: Here he would &s;ee the mind perfectly naked; he might di&s;tingui&s;h all its movements; he might, perhaps, di&s;cover in it more &s;weetne&s;s and tranquillity than in his own; he might, perhaps, clearly perceive, that virtue is more natural to the &s;avage than to the civi|lized, and that vice derives its origin and &s;upport from &s;ociety alone.</P>
<P>But to return to our &s;ubject: If North Ame|rica affords only &s;avages, Mexico and Peru pre|&s;ent us with a poli&s;hed people, governed by laws, and &s;ubject to regal e&s;tabli&s;hments. They had indu&s;try, arts, and a &s;pecies of religion. They dwelt in cities, where order and police were main|tained by the authority of the &s;overeign. The&s;e people, who were very numerous, cannot be con&s;idered as new nations, or as originating from individuals who had e&s;caped from Europe or A&s;ia, from whom they are &s;o remote. Be&s;ides, if the &s;avages of North America, becau&s;e they are &s;ituated under the &s;ame latitude, re&s;emble the Tartars; the people of Mexico and Peru, though, like the Negroes, they live under the Torrid Zone, have no &s;imilarity to them. What then is the origin of the&s;e people, and what cau&s;e can be a&s;|&s;igned for the difference of colour in the human &s;pecies, &s;ince the influence of climate is in&s;uf|ficient, in this ca&s;e, to &s;olve the phaenomenon?</P>
<P>Before an&s;wering the&s;e que&s;tions, we mu&s;t continue our de&s;cription of the &s;avages of South America. Tho&s;e of Florida, of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, <PB N="174" REF="179"> and of the more &s;outherly regions, though not ab&s;olutely brown, are more tawny than the Ca|nadians. The oil and paint with which they rub their bodies, render their colour unnaturally olive. Coreal tells us, that the women of Flo|rida are tall, &s;trong, and, like the men, of an olive colour; that they paint their arms, limbs, and body, with &s;everal colours, which remain for ever, becau&s;e they are engrained in the &s;kin by means of puncturing; that the olive colour of both &s;exes proceeds not &s;o much from the heat of the climate, as from the oil with which they varni&s;h their &s;kin: He adds, that the wo|men are extremely active; that, with an infant in their arms, they &s;wim acro&s;s large rivers; and that, with equal agility, they climb the high|e&s;t trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Voy. de Coreal, tom. 1. p. 36.</NOTE>. All the&s;e qualities they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with the Canadians and other &s;avages of America. The author of the Natural and Moral Hi&s;tory of the Antilles remarks, that the Apalachians, a people bordering on Florida, are tall, well-&s;haped, and of an olive colour; and that they all have long black hair: He adds, that the Caribbees, who inhabit the Antilles, have &s;prung from the &s;avages of Florida; and that the time of their migration has been handed down by tradition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. des i&s;les Antilles, p. 351.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The natives of the Lucai i&s;lands are le&s;s tawny than tho&s;e of St Domingo and Cuba. But &s;o <PB N="175" REF="180"> few of either now remain, that the relations of the fir&s;t voyagers to the&s;e countries can derive no &s;upport from them. The&s;e people, it has been alledged, were very numerous; that they were governed by a kind of chiefs called Ca|ciques; and that they had prie&s;ts and phy&s;icians. But all this is problematical, and, be&s;ides, has no connection with our hi&s;tory. The Caribbees, in general, &s;ays Father du Tertre, are tall, and have a plea&s;ant a&s;pect; they are &s;trong, robu&s;t, active, and healthy; &s;ome of them have flat vi&s;ages and depre&s;&s;ed no&s;es: But the&s;e features are not na|tural to them, but artificially induced by their parents, &s;oon after birth. This capricious prac|tice of altering the natural figure of the head is very general among &s;avage nations. Mo&s;t of the Caribbees have &s;mall black eyes, white teeth, and long, &s;mooth, black hair. Their colour is tawny or olive; and this colour is natural to them, and not the effect of painting, as &s;ome authors have maintained; for the colour of &s;uch of their children as have been trained up among Europeans, and not allowed the u&s;e of paint, was preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that of their parents. All the&s;e &s;avages, though they never think, have a pen&s;ive melancholy a&s;pect. Though cruel to their ene|mies, they are naturally mild and compa&s;&s;ionate. They marry indifferently, either their own mo|thers or &s;trangers. Their cou&s;ins-german belong to them by law; and &s;everal of them have been known to po&s;&s;e&s;s, at the &s;ame time, two &s;i&s;ters, <PB N="176" REF="181"> or the mother and the daughter, and even their own daughter. Tho&s;e who have &s;everal wives, vi&s;it them alternately for a month, or a &s;tated number of days, which extingui&s;hes jealou&s;y a|mong the women. They ea&s;ily pardon adultery in their wives; but they never forgive him who debauches them. They feed upon crabs, turtles, lizards, &s;erpents, and fi&s;hes, which they &s;ea&s;on with pimenta and the flour of manioc<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 453, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Being extremely indolent, and accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t unbounded independence, they dete&s;t &s;ervitude, and never can be trained to labour like the Ne|groes. To pre&s;erve their liberty, they exert e|very effort; and, when they find it impracticable, they, rather than work, chu&s;e to die of hunger, or of chagrin. The Arrouaguas, who are milder than the Caribbees, are &s;ometimes employed; but it is only in fi&s;hing or hunting, exerci&s;es of which they are naturally fond, and to which they have been accu&s;tomed in their own country. If the&s;e &s;avages are to be retained as &s;laves, they mu&s;t be treated with as much gentlene&s;s as dome&s;tic &s;ervants, otherwi&s;e they will de&s;ert, or peri&s;h with melancholy. The Bra&s;ilian &s;laves have nearly the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, though they &s;eem to be le&s;s &s;tupid, indolent, and melancholy than any other American &s;avages. However, when treat|ed with gentlene&s;s, they may be trained to any operation, except that of cultivating the ground, <PB N="177" REF="182"> which they con&s;ider as the characteri&s;tic badge of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Savage women are always le&s;s than the men. The Caribbee females are fat, and tolerably hand|&s;ome. Their hair and eyes are black; their vi|&s;age is round, their mouth &s;mall, their teeth white; their air is more open, gay, and lively, than that of the men; and they are mode&s;t and re&s;erved. They daub them&s;elves with paint; but they do not u&s;e the black &s;trokes upon the face and other parts of the body, as is cu&s;tomary with the men. They wear only a &s;mall apron, made of cotton, &s;tudded with beads, about eight or ten inches broad by five or &s;ix long. This &s;tuff they purcha&s;e of the Europeans; and, be|&s;ides the apron, they u&s;e collars of the &s;ame cloth round their necks, which hang down upon their bo&s;oms. They likewi&s;e wear bracelets of this &s;tuff on their wri&s;ts and arms, and ear-rings made of a blue &s;tone or of &s;trings of beads. The la&s;t ornament peculiar to the women is a kind of bu&s;kin of cotton &s;tudded with beads, which extends from the ankle to the calf of the leg. As &s;oon as the girls arrive at the age of puberty, they are furni&s;hed with an apron and bu&s;kins, the latter of which are made &s;o tight, that they cannot be removed; and, as they prevent the under part of the leg from thickening, the upper parts grow larger and &s;tronger than they would naturally do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nouv. Voy. aux i&s;les, tom. 2. p. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="183"> The inhabitants of Mexico and Peru are &s;o mixed, that it is difficult to find two faces of the &s;ame colour. In the town of Mexico, there are Europeans, Indians from north and &s;outh Ame|rica, African Negroes, Mulattoes, and mongrels of every kind; &s;o that we &s;ee men there of e|very &s;hade between black and white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres Edifiantes, recueil 11. p. 119.</NOTE>. The natives of the country are brown or olive, well|made, and nimble. They have little hair, even on their eye-brows; but that on their head is very long and very black<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Coreal, tom. 1. p. 116.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The natives of the I&s;thmus of America are, as Wafer remarks, generally of a good &s;tature and &s;hape. They have elegant limbs, a full che&s;t, and are extremely active and fleet in the chace. The women are little and &s;quat; and though, when young, they are jolly and have brilliant eyes; yet they po&s;&s;e&s;s not equal vivacity with the men. Both men and women have round faces, &s;hort flat no&s;es, large eyes, mo&s;tly of a gray colour, and full of fire, high fore-heads, white teeth, thin lips, mouths of a middle &s;ize, and, in general, a very regular &s;et of features. They all have long, black, &s;traight hair; and the men would have beards, if they did not pull out the hairs. Their colour is tawny; and their eye-brows are as black as jet.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only natives of this I&s;thmus; for we find among them a &s;pecies of <PB N="179" REF="184"> white men, who&s;e colour re&s;embles not that of the Europeans, but their whitene&s;s is &s;imilar to that of milk, or to the hairs of a white hor&s;e. Their &s;kin is covered with a kind of &s;hort white down, which is not &s;o thick upon the cheeks and fore-head as to conceal the &s;kin. Their eye|brows are perfectly white, as well as their hair, which is &s;even or eight inches long, and half cri&s;ped. The&s;e Indians are not &s;o tall as the o|thers; and, what is &s;ingular, their eye-lids are oblong&punc; or rather in the form of a cre&s;cent, with the points turned down. Their eyes are &s;o weak, that they can hardly &s;ee any object during the day; they cannot &s;uffer the rays of the &s;un, and have no di&s;tinct vi&s;ion but from the light of the moon. Their complexion is extremely de|licate; they have an abhorrence at all hard la|bour; they &s;leep during the day, and never go abroad but in the night. When the moon &s;hines, they run through the deepe&s;t &s;hades of the fore&s;ts with as much freedom and nimblene&s;s as other men do in the cleare&s;t day. Upon the whole, the&s;e men are neither &s;o robu&s;t nor vigorous as the other Indians: They form a peculiar and di&s;tinct race. But it &s;ometimes happens, that a hu&s;band and wife, though both of a copper co|lour, produce one of the&s;e white children. Wa|fer, from whom I have tran&s;cribed the&s;e facts, tells us, that he has &s;een a child of this kind be|fore it was a year old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier, tom. 4. p. 252.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="185"> If this fact be true, the &s;ingular colour and con&s;titution of the&s;e white Indians would be only a &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e which they derive from their parents. But, if the&s;e white Indians are not produced by tho&s;e of a copper colour, but form a di&s;tinct race, then they re&s;emble the Chacrelas of Java, and the Bedas of Ceylon, which I have de&s;cribed above. If, however, the&s;e white people actually proceed from copper-coloured parents, we mu&s;t allow that the Chacrelas and Bedas have al&s;o been produced by tawny progenitors, and that all the white men, whom we find at &s;uch great di&s;tances from each other, form not a par|ticular race, but are only individuals who have accidentally degenerated from their original &s;tock.</P>
<P>This la&s;t opinion, I acknowledge, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t probable; and, if voyagers had given us de&s;criptions of the Bedas and Chacrelas e|qually exact with what Wafer has given of the Dariens, we &s;hould, perhaps, have been &s;atisfied that they are not, any more than the latter, of European extraction. The production of whites by Negro parents, which &s;ometimes happens, adds great force to this theory. In the hi&s;tory of the French Academy, we have de&s;criptions of two of the&s;e white Negroes. I have &s;een one of them my&s;elf, and I am a&s;&s;ured, that they are very frequent among the Negroes of Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Venus Phy&s;ique.</NOTE>. What I have &s;een, independent of the relations <PB N="181" REF="186"> of voyagers, leaves me no room to doubt con|cerning the origin of the&s;e white Negroes: They are only Negroes who have degenerated from their race, and not a particular and permanent &s;pecies of men: In a word, they are among the Negroes, what Wafer tells us the white Indians are among the yellow or copper-coloured Indi|ans of Darien, and, probably, what the Chacrelas and Bedas are among the brown Indians of the Ea&s;t. It is &s;ingular, that this variation of na|ture takes place only from black to white, and not from white to black. It is no le&s;s &s;ingular, that all the people in the Ea&s;t Indies, in Africa, and in America, where the&s;e white men appear, lie under the &s;ame latitude: The I&s;thmus of Da|rien, the Negro country, and the i&s;land of Cey|lon, are under the very &s;ame parallel. Whites, then, appears to be the primitive colour of na|ture, which may be varied by climate, by food, and by manners, to yellow, brown, and black, and which, in certain circum&s;tances, returns, but &s;o greatly altered, that it has no re&s;emblance to the original whitene&s;s, becau&s;e it has been adul|terated by the cau&s;es which have already been a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the two extremes continu|ally approach each other. Nature, in her mo&s;t perfect exertions, made men white; and the &s;ame Nature, after &s;uffering every po&s;&s;ible change, &s;till renders them white: But the natural or &s;pe|cific whitene&s;s is very different from the indivi|dual <PB N="182" REF="187"> or accidental. Of this we have examples in vegetables, as well as in men and other animals, A white ro&s;e is very different, even in the qua|lity of whitene&s;s, from a red ro&s;e, which has been rendered white by the autumnal fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>A &s;till farther proof that tho&s;e white men are only degenerated individuals, may be drawn from their comparative weakne&s;s of con&s;titution, and from the extreme feeblene&s;s of their eyes. This la&s;t fact will appear to be le&s;s &s;ingular, when we reflect, that, in Europe, very fair men have ge|nerally weak eyes; and I have frequently re|marked that their organs of hearing are often dull. Nay, it is even alledged, that dogs of a perfect white colour, are deaf: Whether this be generally the ca&s;e, I know not; but I have found it to be true in &s;everal in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Like the natives of the I&s;thmus, the Indians of Peru are of a copper-colour, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who dwell in the plains, and along the &s;ea-coa&s;t; for tho&s;e who live in the elevated parts of the country, as between the two chains of the Cor|deliers, are nearly as white as the Europeans. Some parts of Peru are a league higher than o|thers, which, with regard to the temperature of the climate, produces a greater change than an hundred leagues of latitude. All the Indians in Guiana and along the river of the Amazons, are more or le&s;s of a reddi&s;h tawny colour. The difference of &s;hades, &s;ays M. de la Condamine, is chiefly owing to the temperature of the air, <PB N="183" REF="188"> which varies from the extreme heat of the Tor|rid Zone, to the great colds occa&s;ioned by the neighbourhood of the &s;now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de la Condamine, p. 49.</NOTE>. Some of the&s;e &s;avages, as the Omaguas, flatten the vi&s;ages of their children, by lacing their heads between two boards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 72.</NOTE>. Others pierce the no&s;trils, lips, or cheeks, in order to fix in them the bones of fi&s;hes, feathers, and other ornaments.

<P>Some voyagers mention a nation in Guiana, of which the natives are blacker than any other Indians. The Arras, &s;ays Raleigh, are nearly as black as the Negroes, are extremely &s;trong, and u&s;e poi&s;oned arrows. This author &s;peaks likewi&s;e of another nation of Indians, who&s;e necks are &s;o &s;hort, and &s;houlders &s;o elevated, that their eyes &s;eem to be upon their &s;houlders, and their mouths in their brea&s;t. This mon|&s;trous deformity cannot be natural: It is not improbable, that &s;avages, who delight in disfigu|ring <PB N="184" REF="189"> Nature by flattening, rounding, or length|ening the heads of their children, &s;hould like|wi&s;e conceive the fancy of &s;inking their heads between their &s;houlders. To give ri&s;e to &s;uch ab&s;urd caprices, nothing farther was nece&s;&s;ary than the idea that deformity rendered them more terrible to their enemies. The Scythians, who were formerly as &s;avage as the pre&s;ent Ameri|can Indians, entertained the &s;ame notions, and practi&s;ed the &s;ame ridiculous arts, which un|que&s;tionably gave ri&s;e to what the antients have written concerning men without heads, men with dogs heads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;avages of Bra&s;il are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize with the Europeans; but they are &s;tronger, more robu&s;t, and more nimble: Neither are they &s;ubject to &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es; and they live very long. Their hair, which is black, rarely grows hoary with age. Their colour is tawny, being a mixture of brown and red. They have large heads, broad &s;houlders, and long hair. They pull the hairs out of their beards, their eye-brows, and every other part of their bodies, which gives them an uncommon and fierce a&s;pect. They pierce their under lip for the purpo&s;e of in&s;erting a &s;mall bone poli&s;hed like ivory, or a green &s;tone. The mothers flatten the no&s;es of their children immediately after birth. They all go ab&s;olutely naked, and paint their bodies with various colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voy. de Lery, p. 108.; Coreal, tom. 1. p. 163.; Mem. pour &s;ervir a l'hi&s;t. des Indes, p. 287.; l'hi&s;t. des Indes par Maff&eacute;e, p. 71.

Tho&s;e of them who <PB N="185" REF="190"> lie on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts are now a little civilized by the trade they carry on with the Portugueze; but mo&s;t of tho&s;e who inhabit the interior parts of the country are &s;till ab&s;olute &s;avages. It is not by force and by &s;lavery that &s;avages are ci|vilized: The mi&s;&s;ionaries have poli&s;hed more men in the&s;e &s;avage nations than the arms of tho&s;e princes who &s;ubdued them. It was in this manner that Paraguay was conquered. The natural ferocity and &s;tubbornne&s;s of the&s;e &s;ava|ges were overcome by the gentlene&s;s, humanity, and venerable example of the mi&s;&s;ionaries. They often &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;olicited to be in&s;tructed in that law which rendered men &s;o perfect; and they frequently &s;ubmitted to its precepts, and united with &s;ociety. Nothing can reflect great|er honour on religion than the civilizing of the&s;e nations of Barbarians, and laying the founda|tions of an empire, without employing any o|ther arms but tho&s;e of virtue and humanity.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Paraguay are, in general, pretty tall, and well &s;haped: Their vi&s;age is long, and their &s;kin of an olive colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coreal, tom. 1. p. 240. et 259.; Lettres edifiantes, recueil 11. p. 391.; Recueil 12. p. 6.</NOTE>. They are &s;ometimes affected with an extraordinary di&s;ea&s;e: It is a &s;pecies of lepro&s;y, which forms a cru&s;t over the whole body, re&s;embling the <PB N="186" REF="191"> &s;cales of fi&s;hes; but it neither occa&s;ions pain, nor does any injury to their con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, recueil 25. p. 122.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Like the Peruvians, the Indians of Chili, ac|cording to Frezier, are of a tawny colour, re|&s;embling reddi&s;h copper. This colour is diffe|rent from that of the Mulattoes, who, as they are produced by a white man and a Negro wo|man, or a white woman and a Negro man, are of a brown colour, or a mixture of black and white. The Indians of South America, on the contrary, are yellow, or rather reddi&s;h. The natives of Chili are of a good &s;ize; they have thick limbs, a large che&s;t, a di&s;agreeable vi&s;age, &s;mall eyes, long ears, and &s;traight, bu&s;hy, black hair. They lengthen their ears, and pull out their beard with pinchers made of &s;hells. Though the climate be cold, mo&s;t of them go naked, ex|cepting a &s;kin thrown over their &s;houlders. At the extremity of Chili, and on the confines of Terra Magellanica, a gigantic race of men have, it is alledged, been lately di&s;covered. Frezier in|forms us, on the authority of &s;everal Spaniards, who pretended to be eye-witne&s;&s;es, that the&s;e men are nine or ten feet high. The&s;e giants, he remarks, are called <HI>Patagonians,</HI> and inhabit the ea&s;tern parts of the de&s;ert coa&s;t mentioned in an|tient voyages: The &s;tory of the Patagonians was afterwards regarded as perfectly fabulous; becau&s;e the Indians di&s;covered along the Straits of Magellan &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not the ordinary &s;tature <PB N="187" REF="192"> of men. It is this circum&s;tance, he continues, that might deceive Froger in his account of the voyage of M. de Gennes; for both &s;pecies of men have been &s;een at the &s;ame time by the crew of one ve&s;&s;el. In 1709, the crew of the James of St Malo &s;aw &s;even of the&s;e giants in Gregory Bay, and tho&s;e of the St Peter of Mar&s;eilles &s;aw &s;ix, whom they acco&s;ted, and offered them bread, wine, and brandy, which they refu&s;ed, though they had pre&s;ented the &s;ailors with &s;ome arrows, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in bringing the &s;hip's boat a|&s;hore
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de M. Frezier, p. 75.</NOTE>. But, as M. Frezier does not alledge that he him&s;elf &s;aw any of the&s;e &s;avages, and as the relations which mention them are replete with exaggerations with regard to other &s;ubjects, the exi&s;tence of a race of giants, e&s;pecially &s;o high as ten feet, mu&s;t be &s;till held as problema|tical: The body of &s;uch a man mu&s;t be eight times the bulk of that of an ordinary per&s;on. The mean height of the human &s;pecies is about five feet; and the extremes exceed not one foot above or below this &s;tandard. A man of &s;ix feet is very tall, and a man of four is very little. Giants and dwarfs who exceed the&s;e terms ought to be con&s;idered as accidental varieties, and not as di&s;tinct and permanent races.</P>
<P>Farther, if tho&s;e Magellanic giants exi&s;t, their number mu&s;t be very &s;mall; for the &s;avages of the Straits and of the adjacent i&s;lands are of a middle &s;tature. Their colour is olive; they have <PB N="188" REF="193"> a large che&s;t, &s;quat bodies, thick limbs, and black &s;traight hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Coreal, p. 231. and 284.; l'Hi&s;t. de la conqu&ecirc;te des Molucques, par Argen&s;ola, tom. 1. p. 35 and 255.; le Voy. de M. de Gennes, par Froger, p. 97.; les Voy. de la Comp. d'Holl. tom. 1. p 651.; and Dampier, p. 179. &amp;c.</NOTE>. In a word, their &s;tature exceeds not the common &s;tandard, and, both in colour and hair, they re&s;emble the other Ameri|cans.</P>
<P>Thus, the whole continent of America con|tains but one race of men, who are all more or le&s;s tawny: And, if we except the northern re|gions, where we find men &s;imilar to the Lap|landers, and likewi&s;e men with fair hair, like the inhabitants of the north of Europe, all the re&s;t of this va&s;t territory is peopled with inhabi|tants, among whom there is little or no diver&s;ity. In the Antient Continent, on the other hand, we have found a prodigious variety in different na|tions. This great uniformity among the na|tives of America &s;eems to proceed from their living all in the &s;ame manner. All the Ameri|cans were, or &s;till are &s;avages: The Mexicans and Peruvians were &s;o recently poli&s;hed, that they ought not to be regarded as an exception. Whatever, therefore, was the origin of the&s;e &s;a|vages, it &s;eems to have been common to the whole. All the Americans have &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;ource, and have pre&s;erved, with little variation, the characters of their race; for they have all continued in a &s;avage &s;tate, and have <PB N="189" REF="194"> followed nearly the &s;ame mode of life. Their climates are not &s;o unequal, with regard to heat or cold, as tho&s;e of the Antient Continent, and their e&s;tabli&s;hment in this country has been too recent to allow tho&s;e cau&s;es which produce va|rieties &s;ufficient time to operate, &s;o as to render their effects con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e rea&s;ons merits a &s;eparate di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion. That the Americans are a new people, can admit of no doubt, when we con&s;ider the &s;mallne&s;s of their number, their ignorance, and the little progre&s;s made by the mo&s;t civilized of them in the arts of life: For, though the fir&s;t relations of the di&s;covery and conque&s;t of Ame|rica mention Mexico, Peru, St Domingo, &amp;c. as countries full of people, and though we are told, that the Spaniards had every where to conquer numerous armies; yet it is ea&s;y to per|ceive that the&s;e facts are exaggerated; becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, few monuments remain of the pretended grandeur of the&s;e people; 2dly, Be|cau&s;e their country, though now peopled with Europeans, who are unque&s;tionably more indu|&s;trious than the natives, is &s;till wild, uncultiva|ted, and covered with wood; and, be&s;ides, it is only a group of inacce&s;&s;ible and uninhabitable mountains, which, of cour&s;e, leaves only &s;mall &s;pots proper either for culture or habitation; 3dly, Becau&s;e, even according to their own tra|ditions, concerning the time when they fir&s;t uni|ted into &s;ociety, the Peruvians reckon only 12 <PB N="190" REF="195"> kings, the fir&s;t of whom began to civilize them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, par Garcila&s;&s;o, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and thus it appears, that not above 300 years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the Peruvians cea&s;ed to be ab|&s;olutely &s;avage; 4thly, Becau&s;e, if the&s;e people had been numerous, the Europeans, even with the advantage of gun-powder, would never have been able to en&s;lave them. The Negroes, not|with&s;tanding all our attempts to conquer and reduce them to &s;ubjection, &s;till pre&s;erve their in|dependence, though the effects of gun-powder were equally unknown and equally formidable to them as to the Americans. The facility, therefore, with which America was conquered, appears to be a demon&s;tration that this country was thinly and recently inhabited.</P>
<P>In the new Continent, the temperature of the different climates is more equal than in the An|tient Continent. This effect is the production of &s;everal cau&s;es. The Torrid Zone is not &s;o hot in America as in Africa. The territories of America comprehended under this Zone are Mexico, New Spain, Peru, the country of the Amazones, Bra&s;il, and Guiana. The heat is never exce&s;&s;ive in Mexico, in New Spain, or in Peru; becau&s;e the&s;e countries are greatly eleva|ated above the ordinary &s;urface of the globe. The thermometer, during the hotte&s;t weather, never ri&s;es &s;o high in Peru as in France. The air is cooled by the &s;nows which cover the tops of the mountains; and this cau&s;e, which is a <PB N="191" REF="196"> con&s;equence of the former, has great influence on the temperature of the climate. The natives al&s;o, in&s;tead of being black or very brown, are only tawny. The country of the Amazones is covered with lakes, mar&s;hes, rivers, and fore&s;ts. There the air is extremely moi&s;t, and, of cour&s;e, much cooler than if the land were dry. It is, be&s;ides, worthy of remark, that the ea&s;t wind, which blows con&s;tantly between the Tropics, ar|rives not at Bra&s;il, the Amazone country, or Guiana, till it has traver&s;ed a va&s;t ocean, and acquired a con&s;iderable degree of cold. It is for this rea&s;on, as well as the quantity of water, fore&s;ts, and almo&s;t perpetual rains, that the&s;e regions of America are much more temperate than they would otherwi&s;e be. But the ea&s;t wind, in traver&s;ing the low lands of America, acquires a con&s;iderable degree of heat before it arrives at Peru. The air in Peru, therefore, would be much hotter than in Bra&s;il or Guiana, if it was not cooled by the elevation of the country and &s;nows. The ea&s;t wind, however, &s;till retains &s;o much heat as to have an influence on the colour of the natives; for tho&s;e who, by their &s;ituation, are much expo&s;ed to it, are more yellow than tho&s;e who live in the valleys be|tween the mountains, and are protected from the effects of this wind. Be&s;ides, this wind, af|ter &s;triking again&s;t the high mountains, is re|flected upon the adjacent plains, and carries a|long with it that fre&s;hne&s;s which it acquires from <PB N="192" REF="197"> the &s;now which covers their &s;ummits; and the melting of the &s;now mu&s;t, of it&s;elf, frequently produce cool winds. The united operation of the&s;e cau&s;es renders the Torrid Zone of Ame|rica uncommonly temperate. It is not, there|fore, &s;urpri&s;ing, that we find not, in this coun|try, black, or even brown men, &s;imilar to the natives of Africa or A&s;ia who live under the &s;ame parallels, where the circum&s;tances to be afterwards mentioned are extremely diffe|rent. Whether we &s;uppo&s;e, then, the inhabitants of America to have been antiently or recently e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country, we ought not to find black men there; becau&s;e their Torrid Zone is a temperate climate.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rea&s;on I mentioned for the little va|riety among the Americans, was the uniformity in their mode of living. They were all &s;avage or very recently civilized, and they all lived in the &s;ame manner. Suppo&s;ing them to have been derived from a common origin, they were di&s;|per&s;ed, without having their breed cro&s;&s;ed. Each family gave ri&s;e to a nation, the inhabitants of which were not only &s;imilar to each other, but to all the neighbouring tribes. As both their food and their climates were nearly the &s;ame, they had no means either of improving or de|generating. They mu&s;t, therefore, have always continued the &s;ame, whatever climate they chanced to occupy.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="198"> With regard to their origin, I have no doubt, independent of theological con&s;iderations, but that it is the &s;ame with ours. The re&s;emblance of the North American &s;avages to the oriental Tartars, renders it probable, that they originally &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tock. The late di&s;cove|ries by the Ru&s;&s;ians of &s;everal lands and i&s;lands beyond Kamt&s;chatka, which extend nearly as far as the we&s;t part of the Continent of Ameri|ca, leave no room to que&s;tion the po&s;&s;ibility of a communication, provided the&s;e di&s;coveries were well atte&s;ted, and the lands lay contiguous. But, even &s;uppo&s;ing con&s;iderable intervals of &s;ea, is it not extremely probable that &s;ome had cro&s;&s;ed the&s;e intervals in que&s;t of new countries, or that they were thrown upon the American coa&s;ts by tempe&s;ts? There is, perhaps, a greater interval of &s;ea between the Marianne i&s;lands and Japan, than between any of the lands from Kamt&s;chatka to America; and yet the Marianne i&s;lands were peopled with inhabitants who mu&s;t have come from the ea&s;tern continent. I am, therefore, inclined to believe that the fir&s;t men who arrived at America, landed on the north-we&s;t of Cali|fornia; that the extreme cold of this climate obliged them to migrate to the more &s;outhern parts of their new habitation; that they fir&s;t &s;ettled at Mexico and Peru, from whence they again &s;pread over the &s;outhern and northern re|gions of that continent; for Mexico and Peru mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the olde&s;t and fir&s;t inha|bited <PB N="194" REF="199"> territories of America, becau&s;e they are the mo&s;t elevated, and the only countries where men were found in the form of regular &s;ocieties. We may al&s;o pre&s;ume that the inhabitants of Davis's Straits, and of the northern parts of La|brador, came originally from Greenland, which is only &s;eparated from America by this narrow &s;trait; for, as I formerly remarked, the natives of Davis's Straits, and tho&s;e of Greenland, have a perfect re&s;emblance to each other. As to the manner in which Greenland was peopled, it is probable that the Laplanders would migrate from Cape-north, which is only 150 leagues from Greenland. Farther, as the i&s;land of Iceland is almo&s;t contiguous to Greenland, and is not very remote from the mo&s;t northerly of the Orcades, it is probable that it has long been inhabited and frequented by the people of Europe; and that colonies had even been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Greenland by the Danes. That white men, with fair hair, &s;hould have been found in Greenland, is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing, as they derived their origin immediately from the Danes; and there is rea|&s;on to think, that the white men along Davis's Straits proceeded from the European whites, who had been &s;ettled in Greenland, from which they might ea&s;ily pa&s;s by traver&s;ing the narrow &s;ea that forms this &s;trait.</P>
<P>America is not le&s;s &s;ingular for the uniformi|ty in the figure and colour of its inhabitants, than Africa is remarkable for the variety of men <PB N="195" REF="200"> it contains. This part of the world is very an|tient, and it abounds with people. The climate is extremely hot; and yet the temperature of the air differs widely in different nations. Their manners al&s;o are not le&s;s various, as appears from the de&s;cription given above. All the&s;e cau&s;es have concurred in producing a greater va|riety of men in this quarter of the globe than in any other: For, in examining the differences of temperatures in the countries of Africa, we find, that, in Barbary and all the regions adjacent to the Mediterranean, the men are white, and only a little tawny: This whole tract of coun|try is refre&s;hed, on one hand, by the air of the Mediterranean &s;ea, and by the &s;nows on Mount Atlas, on the other: It is, be&s;ides, &s;ituated in the Temperate Zone, on this &s;ide of the Tropic. All the natives, likewi&s;e, from Egypt to the Canary i&s;lands, are only more or le&s;s tawny. Beyond the Tropic, and on the other &s;ide of Mount At|las, the heat becomes much greater, and the in|habitants are very brown, but not entirely black. But, when we come to the 17th or 18th degree of north latitude, under which Senegal and Nu|bia are &s;ituated, the heat is exce&s;&s;ive, and the natives are perfectly black. At Senegal, the li|quor in the thermometer ri&s;es to 38 degrees, while it &s;eldom ri&s;es to 30 in France, and never exceeds 25 in Peru, though it be &s;ituated under the Tor|rid Zone. In Nubia, we have no ob&s;ervations made with the thermometer: But all travellers <PB N="196" REF="201"> agree in declaring the heat to be exce&s;&s;ive. The &s;andy de&s;arts between Upper Egypt and Nubia heat the air to &s;uch a degree, that the north wind mu&s;t be extremely &s;corching in that coun|try. Be&s;ides, as the ea&s;t wind, which generally blows between the Tropics, arrives not at Nu|bia till after it has traver&s;ed Arabia, it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing to find the natives very black: It is &s;till Iefs &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the inhabitants of Senegal perfectly black; for the ea&s;t wind, before it reaches them, mu&s;t blow over the whole of Afri|ca in its greate&s;t breadth, which renders the heat of the air almo&s;t in&s;upportable. Taking, there|fore, the whole of Africa &s;ituated between the Tropics, where the ea&s;t wind blows mo&s;t con|&s;tantly, we may ea&s;ily conceive why the we&s;t|ern coa&s;ts of this part of the globe &s;hould, and actually do &s;uffer a greater degree of heat than the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts; for this wind arrives at the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts with a fre&s;hne&s;s which it acquires by traver&s;ing a va&s;t &s;ea; but, on the other hand, before it arrives at the we&s;tern coa&s;ts, it acquires a &s;corching heat by blowing acro&s;s the interior regions of Africa. It is for this rea&s;on that the coa&s;ts of Senegal, Sierra-Leona, Guiney, and all the we&s;tern parts of Africa &s;ituated under the Tropics, are the hotte&s;t climates on the globe. It is not near &s;o hot on the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts, as at Mo&s;ambique, Mombaza, &amp;c. I cannot, there|fore, he&s;itate in a&s;cribing to this rea&s;on the cau&s;e of our finding the true Negroes, or the blacke&s;t <PB N="197" REF="202"> men, on the we&s;tern territories of Africa, and Caffres, or men of a le&s;s deep blackne&s;s, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts. The difference between the&s;e two kinds of blacks, which is very apparent, pro|ceeds from the heat of the climate, which is not very hot in the ea&s;tern parts, but exce&s;&s;ive on the we&s;tern. Beyond the Tropic on the &s;outh, the heat con&s;iderably dimini&s;hes, both on account of the higher latitude, and becau&s;e the point of Africa begins to turn narrow; and this point of land, being &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, receives fre&s;h|er breezes than if it had been in the mid&s;t of a continent. The natives al&s;o of this country be|gin to whiten, and are naturally more white than black, as was formerly remarked. Nothing can prove more clearly that the climate is the prin|cipal cau&s;e of the varieties of mankind, than this colour of the Hottentots, who&s;e blackne&s;s could not be dimini&s;hed but by the temperature of the climate.</P>
<P>We will be the more confirmed in this opi|nion, if we examine the other people who live under the Tropics, to the ea&s;t of Africa. The inhabitants of the Maldiva i&s;lands, of Ceylon, of the point of the Indian Penin&s;ula, of Sumatra, of Malacca, of Borneo, of Celebes, of the Phi|lippine i&s;lands, &amp;c. are all very brown, without being ab&s;olutely black; becau&s;e all the&s;e terri|tories are either i&s;lands or penin&s;ula's. The &s;ea, in the&s;e climates, has a great effect in tempering the air; and be&s;ides, the ea&s;t and we&s;t winds, <PB N="198" REF="203"> which blow alternately in this part of the globe, pa&s;s over a va&s;t extent of &s;ea, before they arrive at this Archipelago. Thus all the&s;e i&s;lands are peopled with brown men, becau&s;e the heat is not exce&s;&s;ive. But, in New Guiney, we find blacks, who, from the de&s;criptions of voyagers, appear to be real Negroes; becau&s;e, in this country, which extends &s;o far to the ea&s;t as to form a kind of continent, the wind which traver&s;es it is much hotter than that which prevails in the Indian ocean. In New Holland, which is not &s;o hot a climate, the natives are le&s;s black, and very &s;imi|lar to the Hottentots. Do not the&s;e Negroes and Hottentots, who live &s;o remote from the o|ther people di&s;tingui&s;hed by that appellation, prove that their colour depends on the heat of the climate? No communication can ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken place between Africa and this &s;outhern continent; and yet we find there the &s;ame &s;pecies of men, becau&s;e the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances concur in producing the &s;ame degree of heat. An example taken from the other ani|mals, will &s;till farther confirm what has been ad|vanced. It has been remarked, that, in the pro|vince of Dauphiny, all the &s;wine are black, but that, in Vivarais, on the other &s;ide of the Rhone, where it is colder than in Dauphiny, all the&s;e a|nimals are white. It is not probable that the in|habitants of one of the&s;e two provinces would agree to rai&s;e only black &s;wine, and the other only white &s;wine. It appears to me that this <PB N="199" REF="204"> phaenomenon is owing to the different tempera|ture of the climates, combined, perhaps, with the manner of feeding the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>The few blacks who are found in the Philip|pines, and &s;ome other i&s;lands of the Indian ocean, are probably derived from the Papous or Ne|groes of New Guiney, with which the Europeans have been acquainted only for the&s;e la&s;t 50 years. Dampier, in the 1700, di&s;covered the mo&s;t ea&s;t|ern part of this country, to which he gave the name of New Britain; but its extent is &s;till un|known; we only know that the&s;e parts of it which have been di&s;covered, &s;eem to be thinly inhabited.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the exi&s;tence of Negroes is confined to tho&s;e parts of the earth, where all the nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances concur in producing a con&s;tant and an exce&s;&s;ive heat. This heat is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, not only to the production, but even to the pre&s;ervation of Negroes, that it has been remarked in our i&s;lands, where the heat, though great, is not comparable to that of Senegal, that the Negro infants are &s;o liable to be affected by impre&s;&s;ions from the air, that they are obliged to keep them, for the fir&s;t nine days after birth, in clo&s;e warm chambers. If the&s;e precautions be neglected, and the children expo&s;ed to the air immediately after birth, they are liable to be affected with a tetanus, or locked jaw, which proves fatal, becau&s;e it deprives them of the power of taking nouri&s;hment. M. Littre, who <PB N="200" REF="205"> di&s;&s;ected a Negro in the year 1702, remarked, that the end of the glans, which was not cover|ed with the prepuce, was black, and that the part of it which was covered was perfectly white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'acad. des &s;ciences, ann&eacute;e 1702, p. 32.</NOTE>. This ob&s;ervation demon&s;trates, that the air is nece&s;&s;ary to produce the blackne&s;s of Negroes. Their children are born white, or rather red, like tho&s;e of other men. But, two or three days after birth, their colour changes to a yellowi&s;h tawny, which grows gradually darker till the 7th or 8th day, when they are totally black. It is well known, that all children, two or three days after birth, are affected with a kind of jaun|dice, which, among white people, &s;oon pa&s;&s;es off and leaves no impre&s;&s;ion: But in Negroes, on the contrary, it gives an indelible colour to the &s;kin, which becomes always more and more black. M. Kolbe remarks, that he has &s;een Hot|tentot children, who were born as white as the Europeans, become olive in con&s;equence of this jaundice which &s;preads over the &s;kin three or four days after birth, and never goes off. This jaundice, and the impre&s;&s;ion of the air, however, are only the occa&s;ional, and not the primary cau&s;es of blackne&s;s; for it has been ob&s;erved, that the children of Negroes, as &s;oon as they come into the world, have black genitals, and a black &s;pot at the root of their nails. The action of the air, and the jaundice, may, perhaps, help to expand this colour; but it is certain, that the <PB N="201" REF="206"> rudiments of blackne&s;s are communicated to them by their parents; that, in whatever part of the world a Negro is brought forth, he will be equally black as if he had been born in his own country; and that, if there is any difference in the fir&s;t generation, it is &s;o &s;mall as not to be per|ceptible. This fact, however, implies not that the colour will continue the &s;ame after many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. On the contrary, there are many rea&s;ons for pre&s;uming, that, as this co|lour is originally the effect of a long continued heat, it will be gradually effaced by the tempera|ture of a cold climate; and, con&s;equently, that if a colony of Negroes were tran&s;planted into a northern province, their de&s;cendants of the 8th, 10th, or 12th generation, would be much fairer, and perhaps as white as the natives of that cli|mate.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts have inquired into the &s;eat of this black colour. Some of them alledge, that it neither re&s;ides in the &s;kin nor &s;carf-&s;kin, but in the cellular membrane between them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'acad. des &s;ciences, ann&eacute;e 1702, p. 32.</NOTE>; that this membrane, after long maceration in hot water, retains its original blackne&s;s; but that the &s;kin and &s;carf-&s;kin appear to be as white as tho&s;e of other men. Dr Town, and &s;ome others, have maintained, that the blood of the Negroes is black, and that their blackne&s;s originates entire|ly from their blood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr Town's letter to the Royal Society.</NOTE>. I am much inclined to <PB N="202" REF="207"> believe this fact; for I have ob&s;erved, that, a|mong us, the blood of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have tawny, yellowi&s;h, or brown complexions, is blacker than that of tho&s;e who are fairer. M. Barrere, who &s;eems to have examined this &s;ub|ject mo&s;t minutely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. &s;ur la couleur des Negres, par. M. Barrere.</NOTE>, tells us, and M. Win&s;low agrees with him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Expo&s;. anatom. du corps humain, par M. Win&s;low, p. 489.</NOTE>, that the &s;carf-&s;kin of Ne|groes is black; and, though its extreme thinne&s;s and tran&s;parency may make it appear white, that it is really as black as the blacke&s;t horn, when reduced to the &s;ame degree of thinne&s;s. They al&s;o a&s;&s;ure us, that the &s;kin of the Negroes is of a reddi&s;h brown colour, approaching to black. This colour of the Negroes, according to Barrere, is produced by their bile, which he affirms, from &s;everal di&s;&s;ections he made in Ca|yenne, in&s;tead of yellow, to be as black as ink. The bile, when ab&s;orbed and di&s;per&s;ed through the body, tinges the &s;kin of white people yel|low; and, if it were black, it would probably produce a black colour. But, as &s;oon as the ef|fu&s;ion of the bile cea&s;es, the &s;kin re&s;umes its na|tural whitene&s;s. We mu&s;t, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e, that the bile of the Negroes is perpetually effu&s;ed, or, as Barrere alledges, that it is &s;o abundant as to be naturally &s;ecreted in the &s;carf-&s;kin, and to tinge it of a black colour. Upon the whole, it is probable, that both the bile and blood of Ne|groes are browner than tho&s;e of white people, as <PB N="203" REF="208"> their &s;kin is likewi&s;e blacker. But one of the&s;e facts cannot be admitted to prove the cau&s;e of the other; for, if the blackne&s;s of the blood or bile be allowed to give the &s;ame colour to the &s;kin, then, in&s;tead of demanding why the &s;kin of Negroes is black, we ought to a&s;k why their blood or their bile are of that colour? This &s;pe|cies of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, in place of &s;olving the que&s;tion, renders it &s;till more intricate. For my own part, it has always appeared to me, that the &s;ame cau&s;e which makes our complexions brown, after being expo&s;ed to the action of the air, and to the rays of the &s;un, which renders the Spaniards more brown than the French, and the Moors than the Spaniards, al&s;o renders the Negroes blacker than the Moors. Be&s;ides, I am not here inquiring how this cau&s;e acts; I only mean to a&s;certain that it does act, and that its effects are more perceptible in proportion to its &s;trength and time of acting.</P>
<P>The heat of the climate is the chief cau&s;e of blackne&s;s among the human &s;pecies. When this heat is exce&s;&s;ive, as in Senegal and Guiney, the men are perfectly black; when it is a little le&s;s violent, the blackne&s;s is not &s;o deep; when it becomes &s;omewhat temperate, as in Barbary, Mogul, Arabia, &amp;c. the men are only brown; and, la&s;tly, when it is altogether temperate, as in Europe and A&s;ia, the men are white. Some varieties, indeed, are produced by the mode of living. All the Tartars, for example, are taw|ny, <PB N="204" REF="209"> while the Europeans, who live under the &s;ame latitude, are white. This difference may &s;afely be a&s;cribed to the Tartars being always expo&s;ed to the air; to their having no cities or fixed habitations; to their &s;leeping con&s;tantly on the ground; and to their rough and &s;avage man|ner of living. The&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient to render the Tartars more &s;warthy than the Europeans, who want nothing to make life ea|&s;y and comfortable. Why are the Chine&s;e fair|er than the Tartars, though they re&s;emble them in every feature? Becau&s;e they are more poli&s;h|ed; becau&s;e they live in towns, and practice eve|ry art to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the injuries of the weather; while the Tartars are perpetu|ally expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un and air.</P>
<P>But, when the cold becomes extreme, it pro|duces effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e of violent heat. The Samoiedes, the Laplanders, and the natives of Greenland, are very tawny. We are even a&s;&s;ured, that &s;ome of the Greenlanders are as black as the Africans. Here the two extremes approach each other: Great cold and great heat produce the &s;ame effect upon the &s;kin, becau&s;e each of the&s;e cau&s;es acts by a quality common to both; and this quality is the dryne&s;s of the air, which, per|haps, is equally great in extreme cold as in extreme heat. Both cold and heat dry the &s;kin, and give it that tawny hue which we find among the Laplanders. Cold contracts all the productions of nature. The Laplanders, accordingly, who <PB N="205" REF="210"> are perpetually expo&s;ed to the rigours of fro&s;t, are the &s;malle&s;t of the human &s;pecies. Nothing can afford a &s;tronger example of the influence of climate than this race of Laplanders, who are &s;ituated, along the whole polar circle, in an ex|ten&s;ive zone, the breadth of which is limited by nothing but the exce&s;&s;ive coldne&s;s; for that race totally di&s;appears, whenever the climate becomes a little temperate.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t temperate climate lies between the 40th and 50th degree of latitude, and it produ|ces the mo&s;t hand&s;ome and beautiful men. It is from this climate that the ideas of the genu|ine colour of mankind, and of the various de|grees of beauty, ought to be derived. The two extremes are equally remote from truth and from beauty. The civilized countries, &s;ituated under this Zone, are Georgia, Circa&s;&s;ia, the Ukraine, Turkey in Europe, Hungary, the &s;outh of Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, and the northern part of Spain. The natives of the&s;e territories are the mo&s;t hand&s;ome and mo&s;t beautiful people in the world.</P>
<P>The climate may be regarded as the chief cau&s;e of the different colours of men. But food, though it has le&s;s influence upon colour, greatly affects the form of our bodies. Coar&s;e, unwhole|&s;ome, and ill-prepared food, makes the human &s;pecies degenerate. All tho&s;e people who live mi&s;erably, are ugly and ill-made. Even in France, the country-people are not &s;o beautiful <PB N="206" REF="211"> as tho&s;e who live in towns; and I have often re|marked, that, in tho&s;e villages where the people are richer and better fed than in others, the men are likewi&s;e more hand&s;ome and have better countenances. The air and the &s;oil have great influence upon the figure of men, bea&s;ts, and plants. In the &s;ame province, the inhabitants of the elevated and hilly parts, are more active, nimble, hand&s;ome, ingenious, and beautiful, than tho&s;e who live in the plains, where the air is thick and le&s;s pure. In France, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to perpetuate the race of Spani&s;h or Barba|ry hor&s;es: They degenerate even in the fir&s;t generation, and, in the third or fourth, unle&s;s the breed be cro&s;&s;ed by the importation of fre&s;h &s;tallions, they become altogether French hor&s;es. The effects of climate and of food upon animals are &s;o well known, that we need hardly mention them: And, though their operation is &s;lower and le&s;s apparent upon men; yet, from analogy, we ought to conclude, that their effects are not le&s;s certain, and that they manife&s;t them&s;elves in all the varieties we find among the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, every circum&s;tance concurs in proving, that mankind are not compo&s;ed of &s;pecies e&s;&s;entially different from each other; that, on the contrary, there was originally but one &s;pecies, who, after multiplying and &s;preading o|ver the whole &s;urface of the earth, have under|gone various changes by the influence of climate, food, mode of living, epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, and the <PB N="207" REF="212"> mixture of di&s;&s;imilar individuals; that, at fir&s;t, the&s;e changes were not &s;o con&s;picuous, and pro|duced only individual varieties; that the&s;e va|rieties became afterwards &s;pecific, becau&s;e they were rendered more general, more &s;trongly marked, and more permanent, by the continual action of the &s;ame cau&s;es; that they are tran&s;|mitted from generation to generation, as defor|mities or di&s;ea&s;es pa&s;s from parents to children; and that, la&s;tly, as they were originally produ|ced by a train of external and accidental cau&s;es, and have only been perpetuated by time and the con&s;tant operation of the&s;e cau&s;es, it is pro|bable that they will gradually di&s;appear, or, at lea&s;t, that they will differ from what they are at pre&s;ent, if the cau&s;es which produced them &s;hould cea&s;e, or if their operation &s;hould be va|ried by other circum&s;tances and combinations.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE NATURE of ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our knowledge is derived from com|paring the relations and di&s;crepancies which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between different objects. If brute animals had no exi&s;tence, the nature of man would be &s;till more incomprehen&s;ible. Having formerly con&s;idered man as a detached being, let us now in&s;titute a compari&s;on between him and the other animals. Let us examine the na|ture of the animal world; let us inve&s;tigate their organization, and &s;tudy their general oeconomy. This inquiry will enable us to draw particular in|ferences, <PB N="209" REF="214"> to di&s;cover relations, to reconcile appa|rent differences, and, from a combination of facts, to di&s;tingui&s;h the principal effects of the living machine, and lead us to that important &s;cience, of which man is the ultimate object.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with explaining the &s;ubject, and by reducing it to its ju&s;t limits.</P>
<P>The general properties of matter, being com|mon to animated as well as inanimated beings, belong not to our &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, Vol. II. Chap. 1.</NOTE>. The qualities po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by plants as well as animals, ought like|wi&s;e to be rejected. It is for this rea&s;on that we have treated of nutrition, of growth, of re|production, and even of generation, properties common to the plant and animal, before enter|ing upon tho&s;e qualities which are peculiar to, and con&s;titute animated bodies.</P>
<P>In the next place, as many beings are com|prehended in the cla&s;s of animals, who&s;e orga|nization differs greatly from that of man, and the more perfect animals, we &s;hall likewi&s;e keep the&s;e out of our view, and examine &s;uch only as make the neare&s;t approaches to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But, as man is not a &s;imple animal, and as his nature is &s;uperior to that of other animals, we &s;hall endeavour to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of this &s;uperiority, in order that we may be enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h what is peculiar to him, from what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with other animated be|ings.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215"> Having thus circum&s;cribed our &s;ubject, and lopt off its extremities, we &s;hall proceed to the general divi&s;ion of it. Before giving a detail of the various parts, and of their functions, let us attend to the general re&s;ults of the animal ma|chine; and, before rea&s;oning upon the cau&s;es, let us enumerate and de&s;cribe the effects.</P>
<P>An animal is di&s;tingui&s;hed by two modes of exi&s;tence, that of motion, and that of re&s;t, which alternately &s;ucceed one another during the whole of life. In the former, all the &s;prings of the machine are in action; in the latter, all is at re&s;t, excepting one part, and that part acts e|qually when the animal is a&s;leep and when it is awake. This part, therefore, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the animal cannot exi&s;t in any manner without it. This part is likewi&s;e inde|pendent of the other, becau&s;e it can act alone; and the other part depends upon this, becau&s;e it cannot act without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The one is a fundamental part of the animal oeconomy, becau&s;e it acts continually, and without inter|ruption; the other is le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, becau&s;e it acts only by alternate intervals.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the animal oeconomy is general, and &s;eems to be well founded. It is not &s;o difficult to examine an animal when a|&s;leep, as when awake and in action. This di|&s;tinction is e&s;&s;ential, and not a &s;imple change of condition, as in an inanimated body, which is equally indifferent to re&s;t or motion; for an inanimated body would continue perpetually in <PB N="211" REF="216"> either of the&s;e &s;tates, unle&s;s it were con&s;trained to change, by the application of &s;ome impelling or re&s;i&s;ting force. But an animal changes its &s;tate by its own proper powers. It pa&s;&s;es na|turally, and without re&s;traint, from motion to re&s;t, and from re&s;t to motion. The moment of awaking returns as nece&s;&s;arily as that of &s;leep, and both happen independent of foreign cau&s;es; becau&s;e the animal can exi&s;t during a certain time only in either &s;tate; and continued walking or &s;leeping would be equally fatal to life.</P>
<P>The animal oeconomy, then, may be divided into two parts; the fir&s;t of which acts perpetually without any interruption, and the &s;econd acts by intervals only. The action of the heart and lungs, in animals which re&s;pire, and the action of the heart in the foetus &s;tate, con&s;titute the for|mer; and the action of the &s;en&s;es, joined to the movements of the members, con&s;titute the lat|ter.</P>
<P>If we conceive the exi&s;tence of beings endow|ed by Nature with this fir&s;t part of the animal oeconomy only, though deprived of &s;en&s;e and progre&s;&s;ive motion, they would &s;till be animated, and would differ in nothing from animals a&s;leep. An oy&s;ter, or a zoophyte, which appear not to po&s;&s;e&s;s either external &s;en&s;es, or the power of progre&s;&s;ive motion, are animals de&s;tined to &s;leep continually. A vegetable, in this view, is a &s;leeping animal: And, in general, every orga|nized being, deprived of &s;en&s;e and motion, may <PB N="212" REF="217"> be compared to an animal con&s;trained by Nature to perpetual &s;leep.</P>
<P>Sleep, in the animal, therefore, is not an ac|cidental &s;tate induced by the exerci&s;e of its func|tions while awake: It is, on the contrary, an e&s;&s;ential mode of exi&s;tence, and &s;erves as a ba&s;is to the animal oeconomy. Our being commen|ces with &s;leep; the foetus &s;leeps perpetually; and the infant con&s;umes mo&s;t of its time in that &s;tate.</P>
<P>Sleep, therefore, which appears to be a &s;tate purely pa&s;&s;ive, a &s;pecies of death, is, on the con|trary, the original condition of animated beings, and the very foundation of life it&s;elf. It is not a privation of certain qualities and exertions, but a real and more general mode of exi&s;tence than any other. With &s;leep our exi&s;tence com|mences: All organized beings, which are not en|dowed with &s;en&s;es, remain perpetually in this condition; none exi&s;t in continued action; and the exi&s;tence of every animal con&s;i&s;ts more or le&s;s of this &s;tate of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>If the mo&s;t perfect animal were reduced to that part alone which acts perpetually, it would not differ, in appearance, from tho&s;e beings to which we can hardly a&s;cribe the name of Ani|mal. With regard to external functions, it would have a &s;triking re&s;emblance to a vegetable; for, though the animal and vegetable differ in external organization, they both exhibit the &s;ame re&s;ults: They both receive nouri&s;hment, <PB N="213" REF="218"> grow, expand, and are endowed with internal movements and a vegetating life. On this &s;up|po&s;ition, they would be equally deprived of progre&s;&s;ive motion, action, and &s;entiment; and they would have no external or apparent cha|racter of animation. But, if this internal part be clothed with a proper cover, or, in other words, if it be endowed with &s;en&s;es and mem|bers, animal life will in&s;tantly manife&s;t it&s;elf; and, in proportion to the quantity of &s;en&s;e and members contained in this cover, the animation will be more complete, and the animal more perfect. It is this envelope or cover, therefore, which con&s;titutes the di&s;tinction between diffe|rent animals. The internal part, which is the ba&s;is of the animal oeconomy, is common to e|very animated being, without exception; and, as to its mo~de, it is nearly the &s;ame in man and in all animals which con&s;i&s;t of fle&s;h and blood. But the external cover is exceedingly diver&s;ified, and the greate&s;t differences originate from the extremities of this cover.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;ubject, let us compare the body of a man with that of a hor&s;e, an ox, &amp;c. The internal part, which acts perpetually, name|ly the heart and lungs, or the organs of circula|tion and re&s;piration, is nearly the &s;ame in man and in the animal. But the external cover is extremely different. The &s;olids of the animal's body, though compo&s;ed of parts &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the human frame, differ prodigiou&s;ly in <PB N="214" REF="219"> number, magnitude, and po&s;ition. The bones are more or le&s;s &s;hortened, rounded, lengthened, flattened, &amp;c. Their extremities are more or le&s;s elevated, or hollowed; and &s;everal of them are &s;ometimes united into one. Some, as the clavicles, are entirely wanting; the number of others is augmented, as the cartilages of the no&s;e, the vertebrae, the ribs, &amp;c. Of others, the num|ber is dimini&s;hed, as the bones of the carpus, metacarpus, tar&s;us, metatar&s;us, phalanges, &amp;c. which give ri&s;e to great varieties in the figure of animals, compared with that of the human body.</P>
<P>We will be &s;till farther convinced, that the principal di&s;tinctions between the body of man, and tho&s;e of the other animals, ari&s;e from the extremities, if we attend to the following cir|cum&s;tances. Let us divide the body into three principal parts, the trunk, the head, and the members. The head and members, which are the extremities of the body, con&s;titute the chief differences between man and the other animals. By examining the&s;e three principal parts, we find that the greate&s;t differences in the trunk are found at its &s;uperior and inferior extremities; for the animals have no clavicles on the &s;uperior extremity of the trunk, and the inferior is ter|minated by a tail, which con&s;i&s;ts of a certain number of external vertebrae, which exi&s;t not in man. In the &s;ame manner, the inferior extre|mity of the head, or jaw-bones, and the &s;uperior, <PB N="215" REF="220"> or frontal bone, differ widely in man and the quadrupeds: The jaw-bones of mo&s;t animals are greatly lengthened, and their frontal bones, on the contrary, are contracted. In fine, by comparing the members of a brute with tho&s;e of a man, it is ea&s;y to perceive that they differ chiefly in their extremities; for, at the fir&s;t glance of the eye, nothing has le&s;s re&s;emblance to the human hand, than the foot of a hor&s;e or an ox.</P>
<P>Regarding the heart, therefore, as the centre of the animal machine, it is obvious that man re&s;embles the other animals in this and the neighbouring parts; and that the farther from this centre, the differences become more con&s;i|derable, till we arrive at the extremities, where they are by much the greate&s;t. But, where this centre, or the heart it&s;elf, differs, then the ani|mal is infinitely removed from man, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es nothing in common with the creatures under con&s;ideration. In mo&s;t in&s;ects, for example, the organization of this principal part of the animal oeconomy is &s;ingular. In&s;tead of a heart and lungs, we find parts which perform &s;imilar func|tions, and for that rea&s;on have been regarded as analogous to tho&s;e vi&s;cera, but which, in reality, are very different, both in their &s;tructure, and in the re&s;ult of their action. In&s;ects, accordingly, differ as much as po&s;&s;ible from man and the qua|drupeds. A &s;light variation in the central parts is always accompanied with an amazing differ|ence <PB N="216" REF="221"> in the external configuration. The heart of a turtle is of a &s;ingular &s;tructure; and its figure is &s;o extraordinary, that it has no re&s;em|blance to any other creature.</P>
<P>In contemplating men, quadrupeds, birds, fi&s;hes, and reptiles, what a prodigious variety occurs in the figure and proportion of their bo|dies, in the number and po&s;ition of their mem|bers, in the &s;ub&s;tance of their fle&s;h, bones, and integuments? The quadrupeds have tails and horns; and all their extremities differ remark|ably from tho&s;e of man. The cetaceous animals live in a different element; and, though they generate in a manner &s;imilar to the quadrupeds, their figure is extremely different, being totally deprived of inferior extremities. The birds dif|fer &s;till more from man, by their beak, their fea|thers, their flying, and their multiplication by means of eggs. The fi&s;hes and amphibious ani|mals are &s;till farther removed from the human figure; and the reptiles are entirely de&s;titute of members. Thus we find, that the greate&s;t di|ver&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in the envelope or external cover, the internal &s;tructure, on the contrary, being nearly the &s;ame: All animals are furni&s;hed with a heart, a liver, a &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and organs of generation. The&s;e, therefore, ought to be regarded as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the ani|mal oeconomy, becau&s;e they are the mo&s;t con|&s;tant, and lea&s;t &s;ubjected to variation.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="222"> But it is worthy of remark, that, even in this cover, &s;ome parts are more con&s;tant than others. None of the&s;e animals are deprived of all the &s;en&s;es. In treating of the &s;en&s;es, we explained what might be their &s;pecies of feeling. We know not the nature of their &s;melling and ta&s;te; but we are certain, that they are all endowed with the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, and perhaps al&s;o with that of hearing. The &s;en&s;es, therefore, may be con&s;idered as another e&s;&s;ential part of the animal oeconomy, as well as the brain, which is the ori|gin of all &s;en&s;ation. Even the infects, which differ &s;o much in their central parts from other animals, have &s;omething analogous to a brain, and its functions are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the other animals: And tho&s;e animals, as the oi&s;ter, which &s;eem to be deprived of a brain, ought to be re|garded as beings only half animated, and as forming the &s;hade between animal and vege|table life.</P>
<P>Thus we have di&s;covered the brain and the &s;en&s;es to be a &s;econd e&s;&s;ential part of the animal oeco|nomy. The brain is the centre of the envelope or cover, as the heart is the centre of the internal part of the animal. It is from the brain that the external parts receive their power of moving and acting, by means of the &s;pinal marrow and the nerves, which are only prolongations of this marrow: And, as the heart and the whole inte|rior parts communicate with the brain and ex|ternal <PB N="218" REF="223"> cover, by means of the di&s;tribution of blood-ve&s;&s;els, the brain has a &s;imilar communi|cation with the internal parts by the ramifica|tions of the nerves. This union is intimate and reciprocal; and, though the functions of the two organs be totally different, they cannot be &s;epa|rated, without in&s;tant de&s;truction to the animal.</P>
<P>The heart, and the whole internal parts, act continually, without the &s;malle&s;t interruption, and independent of external cau&s;es. But the &s;en&s;es and envelope act only by alternate inter|vals, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vibrations excited by exter|nal cau&s;es. Objects act upon the &s;en&s;es, and this action is modified by the &s;en&s;es, and tran&s;ported, in this modified form, to the brain, where the impre&s;&s;ion fir&s;t receives the appellation of Sen&s;a|tion: The brain, in con&s;equence of this impre&s;|&s;ion, acts upon the nerves, and communicates the vibrations it receives; and the&s;e vibrations produce progre&s;&s;ive motion, and all the other external actions of the body. When a body is acted upon by any cau&s;e, it is well known, that the body re-acts upon the cau&s;e. Thus objects act upon animals by means of the &s;en&s;es, and animals re-act upon objects by their external movements; and, in general, action is the cau&s;e, and re-action the effect.</P>
<P>The effect, it may be &s;aid, is not, in this ca&s;e, proportioned to the cau&s;e: In &s;olid bodies, which follow the laws of mechani&s;m, action and re|action are always equal. But, in the animal <PB N="219" REF="224"> body, re-action, or external motion, &s;eems to be incomparably greater than action; and, con&s;e|quently, progre&s;&s;ive motion, and the other ex|ternal movements, ought not to be regarded as &s;imple effects of the impre&s;&s;ions of objects upon the &s;en&s;es. To this objection I reply, that, though effects, in certain circum&s;tances, appear to be proportioned to their cau&s;es; yet there are in nature innumerable in&s;tances where the effects have no proportion to their apparent cau&s;es. A &s;ingle &s;park of fire will inflame a magazine of powder, and blow up a citadel. A &s;light friction produces, by electricity, a concu&s;&s;ion &s;o violent, that it is communicated to great di&s;tances, and affects equally a thou&s;and per&s;ons at the &s;ame time. It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;es &s;hould produce a violent re-action in the animal body, manife&s;ting it&s;elf by external movements.</P>
<P>Cau&s;es which admit of mea&s;urement, and the quantity of who&s;e effects can be exactly e&s;tima|ted, are not &s;o numerous as tho&s;e who&s;e qualities and manner of acting are perfectly unknown; and, con&s;equently, the proportion they may have to their effects mu&s;t be equally unknown. To mea&s;ure a cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;imple; its action mu&s;t be con&s;tant, and uniformly the &s;ame, or, at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t vary only according to a known law. Now, mo&s;t effects in nature are produced by a combination of different cau&s;es, the action of which varies, and which ob&s;erve no con&s;tant <PB N="220" REF="225"> law; and, of cour&s;e, they can neither be mea|&s;ured, nor e&s;timated, but by endeavouring to ap|proach the truth by probable conjectures.</P>
<P>I pretend not, therefore, to lay it down as a demon&s;trated fact, that progre&s;&s;ive motion, and the other external movements of animals, have no other cau&s;e but that of the impre&s;&s;ions of ob|jects upon the &s;en&s;es. I only &s;ay, that the fact is probable, and &s;eems to be founded on &s;trong analogies: For I find, that all organized beings, which are deprived of &s;en&s;es, are likewi&s;e depri|ved of the power of progre&s;&s;ive motion, and that all tho&s;e which are endowed with &s;en&s;es, enjoy likewi&s;e the loco-motive faculty. I al&s;o find, that this action of objects upon the &s;en&s;es often makes the animal move in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and even in|voluntarily; and that, when the movement is determined by the will, it is always the effect either of the immediate action of objects upon the &s;en&s;es, or of the remembrance of a former impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To render this matter more clear, let us analyze the phy&s;ical laws of our own actions. When an object &s;trikes any of our &s;en&s;es, and produces an agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and, of cour&s;e, a de&s;ire, this de&s;ire mu&s;t have a relation to &s;ome quality or mode of our enjoyment. We cannot de&s;ire an object in any other way than to have an inclina|tion to &s;ee, hear, ta&s;te, &s;mell, or touch it; and this de&s;ire is only to gratify more fully either that &s;en&s;e with which we perceive the object, or &s;ome <PB N="221" REF="226"> of our other &s;en&s;es at the &s;ame time; or, in other words, to heighten the agreeablene&s;s of the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation, or to excite another, which is a new mode of enjoying an object: For, the moment we perceive our object, if we could fully enjoy it by all the &s;en&s;es at once, we would have no|thing to de&s;ire. De&s;ire, then, originates from our being ill &s;ituated with regard to the object perceived. We are either too near or too di|&s;tant from it. We, therefore, naturally change our &s;ituation; becau&s;e, at the &s;ame time that we perceive the object, we al&s;o perceive the ob&s;truc|tion to the full enjoyment of it, ari&s;ing from the di&s;tance or proximity of our &s;ituation. Hence the movements we perform in con&s;equence of de&s;ire, and the de&s;ire it&s;elf, proceed entirely from the impre&s;&s;ion made by the object upon our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>When we perceive an object with the eye, and have an inclination to touch it, if it be near, we &s;eize it with our hand, and, if at a di&s;tance, we move forward in order to approach it. A man, when deeply occupied with &s;tudy, if he be hungry, will lay hold of bread which he feels under his hand, and even carry it to his mouth and eat it, without being con&s;cious of his having acted in this manner. The&s;e motions nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion made by the ob|ject; and they would never fail to &s;ucceed the impre&s;&s;ion, if this natural effect were not oppo&s;ed by other impre&s;&s;ions, which, by acting at the <PB N="222" REF="227"> &s;ame time, often weaken and efface the action of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>An organized being, therefore, without &s;en|&s;ation, as an oy&s;ter, which probably enjoys the &s;en&s;e of feeling very imperfectly, is deprived not only of progre&s;&s;ive motion, but of &s;entiment and intelligence; becau&s;e each of them would equal|ly excite de&s;ire, and this de&s;ire would manife&s;t it&s;elf by external movements. I am uncertain whether beings deprived of &s;en&s;es have any per|ception of their own exi&s;tence; if they have, it mu&s;t be very imperfect, &s;ince they are unable to perceive the exi&s;tence of others.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;ubject &s;till farther, let us &s;uppo&s;e a man, at the moment he wi&s;hes to ap|proach an object, &s;uddenly deprived of all his members, would he not endeavour to trail his trunk along the ground in order to gratify his de&s;ire? Nay, were he reduced to a globular form, and actuated by the &s;ame de&s;ires, though depri|ved of every faculty of motion, he would &s;till exert all his force to obtain a change of &s;itua|tion: But, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, as he could only act again&s;t the point that &s;upported him, he would &s;till evince his pa&s;&s;ion by rai&s;ing his body. Thus external and progre&s;&s;ive motion depend not on the organization and figure of the body, &s;ince, whatever be the confirmation of any being, if endowed with &s;en&s;es and a de&s;ire of gratifying them, it would not fail to move.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228"> The facility, the quickne&s;s, the direction, and the continuation of motion, depend, it is true, upon external organization: But the cau&s;e, prin|ciple, and determination of it, proceed &s;olely from de&s;ire, excited by the impre&s;&s;ion of objects upon the &s;en&s;es; for, if a man were deprived of &s;ight, he would make no movement to gratify his eyes. The &s;ame thing would happen if he were de|prived of any of the other &s;en&s;es; and, if depri|ved of every &s;en&s;e, he would remain perpetually at re&s;t; and no object would excite him to move, though, by his external conformation, he were fully capable of motion.</P>
<P>Natural wants, as that of taking nouri&s;hment, are internal movements, which nece&s;&s;arily excite de&s;ire or appetite. The&s;e movements may pro|duce external motion in animals; and, provided they are not entirely deprived of external &s;en&s;es, relative to the&s;e wants, they will act in order to &s;upply them. Want is not de&s;ire; the former differs from the latter as cau&s;e differs from effect; de&s;ire, therefore, cannot be produced with|out the intervention of &s;en&s;es. Whenever an animal perceives an object fitted to &s;upply its wants, de&s;ire is in&s;tantly excited, and action or motion &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>The action of external objects mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce &s;ome effect; and it is ea&s;y to perceive that this effect is animal motion, &s;ince every time the &s;en&s;es are &s;truck in the &s;ame manner, the &s;ame movements uniformly &s;ucceed. But how <PB N="224" REF="229"> does the action of objects excite de&s;ire or aver|&s;ion? How &s;hall we obtain a clear conception of the operation of that principle to which the &s;en&s;es communicate their notices? The &s;en&s;es are only the middle term between the action of objects and animal action. This principle, however, has the power of determining all our motions; for it can modify and alter the ani|mal action, and even &s;ometimes counteract it, notwith&s;tanding the impre&s;&s;ion of objects.</P>
<P>With regard to man, who&s;e nature is &s;o dif|ferent from that of other animals, this que&s;tion is difficult to &s;olve; becau&s;e the &s;oul participates all our movements; and it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the effects of this &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance from tho&s;e produced &s;olely by the material part of our frame. Of this we can form no judgment but by analogy, and by comparing our actions to the natural operations of the other animals. But, as this &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance has been conferred on man alone, by which he is enabled to think and reflect, and, as the brutes are purely material, and neither think nor reflect, and yet act, and &s;eem to be determined by motives, we cannot he&s;itate in pronouncing the principle of motion in them to be perfectly mechanical, and to de|pend ab&s;olutely on their organization.</P>
<P>I apprehend, therefore, that, in the animal, the action of objects on the &s;en&s;es produces an|other on the brain, which I con&s;ider as a ge|neral internal &s;en&s;e, that receives all the impre&s;|&s;ions <PB N="225" REF="230"> tran&s;mitted to it by the external &s;en&s;es. This internal &s;en&s;e is not only &s;u&s;ceptible of vi|brations from the action of the &s;en&s;es, but is ca|pable of retaining, for a long time, the vibrations thus excited; and it is the continuation of the&s;e vibrations that con&s;titute impre&s;&s;ions, which are more or le&s;s deep, in proportion to the duration of the vibrations.</P>
<P>The internal &s;en&s;e, therefore, differs, in the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, from the external &s;en&s;es by the facul|ty which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of receiving every &s;pecies of impre&s;&s;ion; while the external &s;en&s;es are only affected in one mode, corre&s;ponding to their con|formation: The eye, for in&s;tance, is not more affected with &s;ound than the ear with light. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The internal &s;en&s;e differs from the external &s;en&s;es, by the duration of the vibrations excited by external cau&s;es. In every other article, both the&s;e &s;pecies of &s;en&s;es are of the &s;ame nature. The internal &s;en&s;e of a brute, as well as its ex|ternal &s;en&s;es, are pure re&s;ults of matter and me|chanical organization. Like the animal, man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this internal material &s;en&s;e; but he is likewi&s;e endowed with a &s;en&s;e of a very different and &s;uperior nature, re&s;iding in that &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance which animates us, and &s;uperintends our determinations.</P>
<P>Hence the brain of an animal is a general &s;en&s;e, which receives all impre&s;&s;ions tran&s;mitted to it by the external &s;en&s;es; and the&s;e impre&s;|&s;ions or vibrations continue longer in the internal <PB N="226" REF="231"> than the external &s;en&s;es. Of this we may ea&s;ily form a conception, &s;ince the duration of impre&s;|&s;ions, even on the external &s;en&s;es, is very diffe|rent. The impre&s;&s;ion of light on the eye is well known to la&s;t much longer than that of &s;ound on the ear. A rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds can be heard di&s;tinctly; but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of colours equally rapid confounds the eye. It is for this rea&s;on that the vibrations tran&s;mitted to the in|ternal &s;en&s;e by the eye are &s;tronger than tho&s;e conveyed by the ear, and that we de&s;cribe ob|jects which we have &s;een in a more lively man|ner than tho&s;e we have heard. The vibrations excited by objects on the eye &s;eem to continue longer than tho&s;e made upon any of the other &s;en&s;es; and, therefore, it appears to participate more of the nature of the internal &s;en&s;e. This might be proved by the quantity of nerves ex|panded on the eye; for it alone receives nearly as many as the three organs of hearing, &s;melling, and ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>The eye, therefore, may be regarded as a continuation of the internal &s;en&s;e. It con&s;i&s;ts, as was remarked in another place, almo&s;t en|tirely of nervous fibres, and is only a prolon|gation of the organ in which the internal &s;en&s;e re&s;ides. It is not, of cour&s;e, &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould make the neare&s;t approach to this inter|nal &s;en&s;e. Its impre&s;&s;ions are not only more durable, but, like the internal &s;en&s;e, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <PB N="227" REF="232"> powers of a nature &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the other &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The eye exhibits external marks of internal impre&s;&s;ions. It expre&s;&s;es de&s;ire or aver&s;ion ex|cited by agreeable or di&s;agreeable objects. Like the internal &s;en&s;e, it is active; but all the other &s;en&s;es are purely pa&s;&s;ive: They are &s;imple or|gans, de&s;tined for the reception of external im|pre&s;&s;ions, but incapable of pre&s;erving or reflect|ing them.</P>
<P>When any of the &s;en&s;es, it mu&s;t be allowed, are long and &s;trongly acted upon, the vibrations continue &s;ome time after the action of the ob|ject has cea&s;ed. But the eye po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this power in a &s;upereminent degree; and it is only exceed|ed by the brain, which not only pre&s;erves the impre&s;&s;ions received, but propagates their ac|tion by communicating vibrations to the nerves. The external organs of &s;en&s;e, the brain, the &s;pinal marrow, and the nerves, which are ex|panded over the whole body, ought to be re|garded as one continued ma&s;s, as an organic machine, of which the &s;en&s;es are the parts to which the action of external objects is applied. The brain is the fulcrum or ba&s;is; and the nerves are the parts which receive motion from the acting powers. But what renders this machine diffe|rent from all others is, that its fulcrum not only re&s;i&s;ts and re-acts, but is even active it&s;elf; be|cau&s;e it long retains received impre&s;&s;ions. And, as this internal &s;en&s;e, the brain and its mem|branes, <PB N="228" REF="233"> is very large, and endowed with great &s;en&s;ibility, it can admit many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and con|temporary vibrations, and retain them in the &s;ame order they were received; becau&s;e each im|pre&s;&s;ion communicates vibrations to one part only of the brain, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive impre&s;&s;ions af|fect the &s;ame part, or contiguous parts, in a dif|ferent manner.</P>
<P>If we &s;uppo&s;e an animal deprived of a brain, but endowed with an external &s;en&s;e of great ex|tent and &s;en&s;ibility, as an eye, for example, ha|ving a retina as large as the brain, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the faculty of retaining received impre&s;&s;ions; it is certain, that an animal of this kind would &s;ee, at the &s;ame time, both pre&s;ent objects, and tho&s;e which it had formerly &s;een; becau&s;e, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, the vibrations always remaining, and the extent of the retina being large enough to receive them on different parts, the animal would perceive, at the &s;ame time, both pre&s;ent and pa&s;t objects; and would, therefore, be me|chanically determined to act according to the number or force of the vibrations produced by the images, corre&s;ponding with, or oppo&s;ite to this determination. If the number of images fitted to excite de&s;ire &s;urpa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;uited to produce aver&s;ion, the animal would nece&s;&s;arily be deter|mined to move, in order to gratify this appetite: But, if the number and force of different images were equal, the animal, having no &s;uperior mo|tive, would remain at re&s;t. I &s;ay, that all this <PB N="229" REF="234"> would happen mechanically, and without the intervention of memory; for, by &s;eeing and be|ing acted upon by all the images at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e which corre&s;pond with de&s;ire would be oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e that corre&s;pond with aver|&s;ion, and from this equilibrium, or from the ex|ce&s;s in number or force of one &s;et of images a|bove another, the animal could alone be deter|mined to re&s;t or to action.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts it appears, that, in brutes, the internal &s;en&s;e differs only from the external &s;en&s;es, by the faculty it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of retaining re|ceived impre&s;&s;ions. This faculty is alone &s;uffi|cient to explain all the actions of animals, and to give us &s;ome idea of what pa&s;&s;es within them. It likewi&s;e demon&s;trates the e&s;&s;ential and infinite difference between them and us, and, at the &s;ame time, enables us to di&s;tingui&s;h what we po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with them.</P>
<P>Animals have &s;ome &s;en&s;es of exqui&s;ite acute|ne&s;s; but, in general, they are not all equal to tho&s;e of man: And, it is worthy of remark, that the degrees of excellence in the &s;en&s;es fol|low not the &s;ame order in the brute, as in the human &s;pecies. The &s;en&s;e mo&s;t analogous to thinking is that of touch; and this &s;en&s;e is more perfect in man than in the other animals. The &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is mo&s;t analogous to in&s;tinct and appetite; and the brute enjoys it in a &s;upe|rior degree. Hence man &s;hould excell in know|ledge, and the brute in appetite. In man, the <PB N="230" REF="235"> fir&s;t &s;en&s;e for excellence is touching, and &s;mel|ling is the la&s;t: In the brute, the &s;en&s;e of &s;mel|ling is the fir&s;t, and that of touching is the la&s;t. This difference has a perfect corre&s;pondence to the nature of each. The &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing is ex|ceeding imperfect and delu&s;ive, without the aid of that of touching; and the former, according|ly, is le&s;s perfect in the brute than in man. The ear, though perhaps equally well con&s;tructed in the animals as in man, is not nearly &s;o u&s;eful to them, becau&s;e they are deprived of &s;peech, which, in man, depends on the ear, an organ which gives activity to this &s;en&s;e, and enables him to communicate his ideas: But hearing, in the brute, is a &s;en&s;e almo&s;t entirely pa&s;&s;ive. Hence man enjoys the &s;en&s;es of touching, &s;eeing, and hearing, more perfectly, and that of &s;melling more imperfectly, than the animal; and, as ta&s;te is an internal &s;melling, and is more analogous to appetite than any of the other &s;en&s;es, the animals al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s it in a &s;uperior degree, as ap|pears from their invincible aver&s;ion again&s;t cer|tain aliments, and their natural appetite for &s;uch as corre&s;pond to their con&s;titutions: But man, if he were not in&s;tructed, would eat the fruit of the mancinella like an apple, and the hemlock like par&s;ley.</P>
<P>The excellence of the &s;en&s;es is the gift of na|ture; but art and habit may be&s;tow on them a greater degree of perfection. A mu&s;ician, who&s;e ear is accu&s;tomed to harmony, is &s;hocked with <PB N="231" REF="236"> di&s;cord: A painter, with one glance of his eye, perceives a number of &s;hades which e&s;cape a com|mon ob&s;erver. The &s;en&s;es and even the appetites of animals may al&s;o be improved. Some birds learn to &s;ing, and to repeat words; and the ar|dor of a dog for the chace may be increa&s;ed by rewarding him for his labours.</P>
<P>But this excellence and improvement of the &s;en&s;es are mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the brute, who always appears to be more active and intelligent in proportion to the perfection of his &s;en&s;es. Man, on the contrary, has too great a portion of rea&s;on and genius to be&s;tow much attention to the improvement of his ear or his eye. Per&s;ons who are &s;hort-&s;ighted, dull of hearing, or in&s;en|&s;ible of &s;mell, &s;uffer not, for that rea&s;on, any diminution of capacity: An evident proof that man is endowed with &s;omething &s;uperior to an internal animal &s;en&s;e, which is a material organ, &s;imilar to the external organs of &s;en&s;ation, and differs from them only by the faculty of retaining received impre&s;&s;ions. But the &s;oul of man is a &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, or &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, totally dif|ferent, both in its action and e&s;&s;ence, from the nature of the external &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>We mean not, however, to maintain that man is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an internal material &s;en&s;e, a|nalogous to the external &s;en&s;es. In&s;pection a|lone is &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h this point. In man, the brain is proportionally larger than in any other animal, which is an evident proof of his <PB N="232" REF="237"> being endowed with this internal material &s;en&s;e. What I mean to inculcate, is, that this &s;en&s;e is infinitely &s;uperior to the other. It is &s;ubject to the commands of the &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, which, at plea&s;ure, &s;uppre&s;&s;es, or gives ri&s;e to all its o|perations. In the animal, this &s;en&s;e is the prin|ciple which determines all its movements; but, in man, it is only an intermediate and &s;econdary cau&s;e of action.</P>
<P>But, let us examine more clo&s;ely the powers of this internal material &s;en&s;e. When we have once fixed the extent of its action, every thing beyond this limit mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, originate from the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, and we will be furni&s;h|ed with a criterion for di&s;tingui&s;hing what we po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with the other animals, and in what articles we excell them.</P>
<P>The internal material &s;en&s;e receives indiffe|rently every impre&s;&s;ion conveyed by the exter|nal &s;en&s;es. The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions proceed from the action of objects, and quickly pa&s;s through the external &s;en&s;es, where they only excite momen|tary vibrations. But their progre&s;s &s;tops at the brain, and produce, in this organ of the internal &s;en&s;e, vibrations which are both di&s;tinct and du|rable. The&s;e vibrations give ri&s;e to de&s;ire or aver|&s;ion, according to the pre&s;ent &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the animal. Immediately after birth, the young animal begins to re&s;pire, and to feel a de&s;ire for food. The organ of &s;melling receives the ef|fluvia of the milk contained in the dugs of the <PB N="233" REF="238"> mother. Vibrations are excited in this &s;en&s;e by the odorous particles, and the&s;e vibrations are tran&s;mitted to the brain, which, in its turn, acts upon the nerves; and the animal is thus &s;timu|lated to make the proper movements, or, in o|ther words, to open its mouth, in order to pro|cure the nouri&s;hment de&s;ired. The &s;en&s;es pe|culiar to appetite being more obtu&s;e in man than in the brutes, the new-born child feels only the de&s;ire of taking nouri&s;hment, which he announ|ces by crying. But he is incapable of procu|ring it him&s;elf; neither is he &s;timulated by the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling; his mouth mu&s;t be applied to the brea&s;t, before he can u&s;e the means of gra|tifying his appetite. Then, indeed, the &s;en&s;es of &s;melling and of touching communicate vibra|tions to the brain, which, by re-acting on the nerves, &s;timulates the child to make the nece&s;|&s;ary motions for receiving and &s;ucking the milk. It is only by the &s;en&s;es of appetite, namely, tho&s;e of &s;melling or ta&s;ting, that the brute animal is appri&s;ed of the pre&s;ence of nouri&s;hment, or of the place where it is to be found. Its eyes are not yet open; and, though they were, they would not, at fir&s;t, be capable of determining it to u&s;e the proper efforts. The eye, which is a &s;en&s;e more analogous to intelligence than to ap|petite, is open in man from the moment of birth; but remains &s;hut, in mo&s;t other animals, for &s;e|veral days. The &s;en&s;es of appetite, on the con|trary, are more perfect and mature in the young <PB N="234" REF="239"> animal than in the infant. This affords another proof, that, in man, the organs of appetite are le&s;s perfect than tho&s;e of intelligence; and that, in the animal, the organs of intelligence are more imperfect than tho&s;e of appetite.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark may be made with regard to progre&s;&s;ive motion, and all the other exter|nal movements. It is long before the infant can u&s;e its members, or has &s;trength enough to change place. But a young animal &s;oon ac|quires the&s;e faculties. The&s;e powers, in the a|nimal, are all relative to appetite, which is ve|hement, quickly unfolded, and the &s;ole princi|ple of motion. But appetite, in man, is feeble, long before it is unfolded, and ought not to have &s;uch influence, as intelligence, upon the deter|mination of his movements. Man, therefore, is, in this re&s;pect, later in arriving at maturity.</P>
<P>Hence, every circum&s;tance, even in phy&s;ics, concurs in demon&s;trating that the brutes are ac|tuated by appetite only, and that man is influ|enced by a &s;uperior principle. The only doubt that remains is the difficulty of conceiving how appetite alone &s;hould produce, in animals, effects &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e produced in men by intelli|gence; and how to di&s;tingui&s;h the actions we perform in con&s;equence of our intellectual powers, from tho&s;e which originate from the force of appetite. I de&s;pair not, however, of being able to remove this difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="240"> The internal material &s;en&s;e, as formerly re|marked, retains, for a long time, the vibrations it receives. This &s;en&s;e, the organ of which is the brain, is common to every animal, and re|ceives impre&s;&s;ions tran&s;mitted to it by each of the external &s;en&s;es. When an object acts upon the &s;en&s;es, this action produces la&s;ting vibrations in the internal &s;en&s;e, and the&s;e vibrations com|municate motion to the animal. When the impre&s;&s;ion proceeds from the &s;en&s;es of appetite, the movement is determined, the animal either advances to lay hold of the object, or flies to a|void it. This motion may be uncertain, when the impre&s;&s;ion is tran&s;mitted by the &s;en&s;es ana|logous to intelligence, as the eye, and the ear. When an animal &s;ees or hears for the fir&s;t time, he feels the impre&s;&s;ion of light or of &s;ound; but the motions produced mu&s;t be uncertain, becau&s;e the&s;e &s;en&s;es have no relation to appetite. It is only by repeated acts, and after the animal has joined to the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;eeing or hearing tho&s;e of &s;melling, ta&s;ting, or touching, that he feels a determination to approach or retire from objects which experience alone renders analo|gous to his appetite.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;ubject, let us examine the conduct of an animal that has been in&s;tructed by man. A dog, for example, though excited by the mo&s;t violent appetite, will not venture to wre&s;t, from the hand of his ma&s;ter, the object that would gratify him; but he, at the &s;ame time, <PB N="236" REF="241"> makes a number of movements in order to ob|tain it. Does not the dog, in this ca&s;e, &s;eem to combine ideas? Does he not appear to de&s;ire, and to fear, in a word, to rea&s;on nearly in the &s;ame manner as a man, when violently tempted to take what belongs to another, but is re&s;trained by the fear of puni&s;hment? This is the vulgar mode of accounting for the conduct of animals. We naturally transfer our own motives to ani|mals, when placed in &s;imilar circum&s;tances; and the analogy is &s;aid to be well founded, becau&s;e in man, and in the animal, the conformation of both the internal and external &s;en&s;es is &s;imi|lar. Though this analogy, however, were ju&s;t, is not &s;omething more required? Is it not nece&s;|&s;ary that the animals &s;hould, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, do every thing which we perform? But the con|trary is evident: Animals never invent, nor bring any thing to perfection; of cour&s;e, they have no reflection; they uniformly do the &s;ame things in the &s;ame manner. This de&s;troys the force of the analogy &s;o much, that we may even doubt of its reality: We ought, therefore, to inquire, whether the actions of brutes proceed not from principles entirely different from tho&s;e which actuate men, and whether their &s;en&s;es alone are not &s;ufficient to produce their actions, with|out the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;cribing to them the powers of reflection.</P>
<P>Their internal &s;en&s;e is &s;trongly agitated by e|very thing that relates to their appetites. A <PB N="237" REF="242"> dog would in&s;tantly &s;eize the object he de&s;ires, if his internal &s;en&s;e retained not impre&s;&s;ions of pain, that had formerly accompanied this action. But the animal has received new qualities from external impre&s;&s;ions: This prey is not pre&s;ented to a &s;imple dog, but to a dog that has been beat: Every time he implicitly obeyed the dictates of appetite, has been followed with blows: The impre&s;&s;ions of pain, therefore, uniformly accom|pany tho&s;e of appetite, becau&s;e they have always been made at the &s;ame time. The animal being thus acted upon at once by two contrary impul|&s;es, which mutually de&s;troy each other, he re|mains in equilibrio, between two equal powers. The cau&s;e determining him to motion being coun|terbalanced, he makes no effort to obtain the object of his de&s;ire. But, though the vibrations occa&s;ioned by appetite and aver&s;ion, or by plea|&s;ure and pain, de&s;troy the effects of each other, a third vibration, which always accompanies the other two, is renewed in the brain of the animal, by the action of his ma&s;ter, from who&s;e hand he has often received his food: And, as this third vibration is not counterbalanced by any oppo&s;ite power, it becomes a cau&s;e &s;ufficient to excite motion. The dog is, therefore, determined to move towards his ma&s;ter, and to fri&s;k about till his appetite be fully gratified.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, and upon the &s;ame prin|ciples, may all the actions of animals, however complicated they appear, be explained, without <PB N="238" REF="243"> the nece&s;&s;ity of attributing to them either thought or reflection. Their internal &s;en&s;e is &s;ufficient to produce every motion they perform. One thing only remains to be illu&s;trated, and that is the nature of their &s;en&s;ations, which, according to the pre&s;ent doctrine, mu&s;t be very different from ours. Have the animals, it may be a&s;k|ed, no knowledge, no &s;entiment, or no con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of their exi&s;tence? Since you pretend to explain all their actions by mechani&s;m, do you not reduce them to mere machines, or in&s;en&s;ible automatons?</P>
<P>If I have properly explained my&s;elf, the read|er ought to perceive, that, &s;o far from depriving animals of all powers, I have already allowed them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing but thought and reflection. Their feelings are even more exqui&s;ite than ours. They are con&s;cious of their actual or pre&s;ent exi&s;tence; but they have no knowledge of that exi&s;tence which is pa&s;t. They have &s;en&s;ations; but they want the faculty of comparing them, or of forming ideas; for ideas are only the re&s;ults of the a&s;&s;ociation or compa|ri&s;on of &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider each of the&s;e articles &s;eparate|ly. The feelings of animals are more exqui&s;ite than tho&s;e of man. This, I imagine, has al|ready been &s;ufficiently proved by what was re|marked concerning the excellence of their &s;en&s;es relative to appetite; by their natural and invin|cible aver&s;ion again&s;t certain objects, and their <PB N="239" REF="244"> uniform and determined attachment to others; and by their faculty of in&s;tantly di&s;tingui&s;hing with certainty what is &s;alutary or noxious. A|nimals, therefore, as well as men, are capable of plea&s;ure and pain. They have no knowledge of good and evil; but they feel the di&s;tinction. Whatever is agreeable to them is good, and whatever is di&s;agreeable is bad. Both are only relations conformable or repugnant to their na|ture and organization. The plea&s;ure of tickling, and the pain of an wound, are common to us and the animals; becau&s;e they depend ab&s;olutely upon an external material cau&s;e, namely, a weak|er or &s;tronger action in the nerves, which are the organs of &s;en&s;ation. Every thing that acts gently on the&s;e organs gives plea&s;ure; and every thing that acts with violence is the cau&s;e of pain. All &s;en&s;ations, then, are &s;ources of plea&s;ure, when they are temperate and natural; but, when too violent, they produce pain, which, in phy&s;ics, is the extreme, rather than the oppo&s;ite of plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations are excited by a light too brilliant, too near an approach to fire, loud noi&s;es, &s;trong &s;mells, in&s;ipid or coar&s;e victuals, and hard friction. But a gentle light, a mode|rate heat, a &s;oft &s;ound, a delicate perfume, a fine favour, and &s;light friction, produce &s;en&s;ations of the mo&s;t agreeable kind. Thus every gentle application to the &s;en&s;es is plea&s;ure, and every &s;hock, or violent impre&s;&s;ion, is pain. As the <PB N="240" REF="245"> cau&s;es, therefore, which give ri&s;e to violent im|pre&s;&s;ions, occur more &s;eldom in nature than tho&s;e that produce &s;oft and moderate movements; and as animals, by the exerci&s;e of their &s;en&s;es, &s;oon acquire the habit of avoiding hurtful objects, and of di&s;tingui&s;hing and approaching &s;uch as are a|greeable to them, the &s;um of agreeable &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t exceed that of the di&s;agreeable; and there|fore the quantity of plea&s;ure mu&s;t be greater than that of pain.</P>
<P>If animal plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts of whatever flatters the &s;en&s;es, and if, in phy&s;ics, what flatters the &s;en&s;es be every thing that corre&s;ponds to nature; if, on the other hand, pain be whatever wounds the organs, and is repugnant to nature; if, in a word, plea&s;ure be phy&s;ical good, and pain phy|&s;ical evil, it is evident, that every &s;entient being mu&s;t enjoy more plea&s;ure than pain; for every thing that corre&s;ponds with his nature, contri|butes to his pre&s;ervation, or &s;upports his exi&s;t|ence, is plea&s;ant; and every thing that tends to his de&s;truction, to derange his organization, or to change his natural condition, is pain. It is by plea&s;ure alone, therefore, that a &s;entient be|ing can continue to exi&s;t; and, if the &s;um of agreeable &s;en&s;ations &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not that of the di&s;|agreeable, deprived of plea&s;ure, he would fir&s;t langui&s;h for want of good, and, loaded with pain, he would next peri&s;h by a &s;uperabundance of evil.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="246"> In man, phy&s;ical good and evil con&s;titute the &s;malle&s;t part of his plea&s;ures and pains. His i|magination, which is never idle, is a con&s;tant &s;ource of unhappine&s;s; for it pre&s;ents to the mind nothing but vain phantoms, or exaggerated pictures. More occupied by the&s;e illu&s;ions than by real objects, the mind lo&s;es both its faculty of judging and its empire: It compares chime|ras only; it &s;ees only at &s;econd hand, and often &s;ees impo&s;&s;ibilities. The will, of which the mind has now no command, becomes a burden: In &s;ine, his extravagant de&s;ires are real pains, and his vain hopes are at mo&s;t but fal&s;e plea&s;ures, which vani&s;h as &s;oon as the mind re&s;umes its fa|culty of di&s;cerning and of judging without pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, when we &s;earch for plea&s;ure, we create to our&s;elves pain; we are mi&s;erable from the moment we de&s;ire to augment our happine&s;s. Good exi&s;ts only within our&s;elves, and it has been be&s;towed on us by Nature; evil is external, and we go in que&s;t of it. The peaceable enjoy|ment of the mind is our only true good: We cannot augment this good, without the danger of lo&s;ing it: The le&s;s we de&s;ire, the more we po&s;&s;e&s;s: Whatever we wi&s;h beyond what Nature has be&s;towed on us is pain; and nothing is plea|&s;ure but what &s;he offers us.</P>
<P>Now, plea&s;ures innumerable are con&s;tantly pre&s;ented to us by Nature: She has provided for our wants, and fortified us again&s;t pain: Phy&s;i|cal <PB N="242" REF="247"> good infinitely exceeds phy&s;ical evil. It is not, therefore, realities, but chimeras, which we ought to dread. Neither bodily pain, nor di&s;ea&s;e, nor death, are formidable; but agitation of mind, the pa&s;&s;ions, and languor, are the only evils we have to apprehend.</P>
<P>The animals have only one mode of acquiring plea&s;ure, the exerci&s;e of their &s;en&s;ations to gratify their de&s;ires. We al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s this faculty: But we are endowed with another &s;ource of plea&s;ure, the exerci&s;e of the mind, the appetite of which is the de&s;ire of knowledge. This &s;ource of plea|&s;ure would be more pure and copious, were its current not interrupted by our pa&s;&s;ions, which de&s;troy all contemplation. Whenever they ob|tain the a&s;cendant, rea&s;on is &s;ilenced, or only makes feeble and unavailing efforts. We, of cour&s;e, lo&s;e all reli&s;h of truth; the charm of illu|&s;ion augments; error fortifies its dominion, and drags us on to mi&s;ery: For what mi&s;ery can be greater than no longer to &s;ee things as they are, to have the faculty of judging perverted by pa&s;|&s;ion, to act only according to its dictates, to ap|pear, con&s;equently, unju&s;t or ridiculous to others, and, la&s;tly, to be obliged to de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves, whenever we can command a moment's re|flection?</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of darkne&s;s and illu&s;ion, we would willingly change the nature of the &s;oul; &s;he has been be&s;towed on us for the purpo&s;es of know|ledge, and we would employ her only for tho&s;e <PB N="243" REF="248"> of &s;en&s;ation. If we could extingui&s;h her light entirely, in&s;tead of regretting the lo&s;s, we would envy the condition of idiots. As we only rea|&s;on by intervals, and as the&s;e intervals are bur|den&s;ome to us, and pa&s;s in &s;ecret reproaches, we wi&s;h to &s;uppre&s;s them. Thus, proceeding always from illu&s;ion to illu&s;ion, we voluntarily &s;eek to lo&s;e &s;ight of our&s;elves, and to terminate the whole by forgetting our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Uninterrupted pa&s;&s;ion is madne&s;s; and mad|ne&s;s is the death of the &s;oul. Violent pa&s;&s;ions, with intervals, are paroxy&s;ms of folly, di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, who&s;e danger con&s;i&s;ts in their fre|quency and duration. Wi&s;dom is only the &s;um of the&s;e intervals of health which we enjoy be|tween the paroxy&s;ms of pa&s;&s;ion, and this &s;um is not entirely made up of happine&s;s; for we then perceive that the mind has been di&s;ea&s;ed; we accu&s;e our pa&s;&s;ions; we condemn our actions. Folly is the germ of mi&s;ery, and wi&s;dom un|folds it. Mo&s;t people who call them&s;elves un|happy, are pa&s;&s;ionate men, or, in other words, fools, who have &s;ome intervals of rea&s;on, during which they perceive their folly, and, of cour&s;e, feel their mi&s;ery: And as, in the elevated con|ditions of life, there are more fal&s;e appetites, more vain preten&s;ions, more di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions, more abu&s;e of the mind, than in the inferior, men of birth and opulence mu&s;t unque&s;tionably be the mo&s;t unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="249"> But, let us turn from the&s;e melancholy ob|jects, the&s;e humiliating truths, and con&s;ider the wi&s;e man, who alone merits examination. He is both ma&s;ter of him&s;elf and of events. Con|tent with his condition, he de&s;ires not to live in any other manner than he has always lived: Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient re&s;ources, he &s;eldom re|quires the aid of others. Occupied perpetually in exerci&s;ing the faculties of his mind, he im|proves his under&s;tanding, cultivates his genius, acquires fre&s;h &s;ources of knowledge; and, being neither tormented with di&s;gu&s;t nor remor&s;e, he enjoys the univer&s;e, by enjoying him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such a man is, doubtle&s;s, the happie&s;t being in nature. To the plea&s;ures of the body, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with the other animals, he joins tho&s;e of the mind, that are peculiar to him. He has two modes of being happy, which mutually aid and fortify each other; and if, by di&s;ea&s;e or accident, he be afflicted with pain, he &s;uffers le&s;s than the fool: He is &s;upported by the &s;trength of his mind, and rea&s;on affords him con&s;olation: Even in &s;uffering pain, he has the plea&s;ure of perceiving that he is able to en|dure it.</P>
<P>Health, in man, is more feeble and precarious than in any other animal. He is oftener &s;ick; his &s;ickne&s;s is of longer duration; and he dies at every age. The brutes, on the contrary, &s;eem to run through the &s;pace allotted to their exi&s;t|ence with firm and equal &s;teps. This circum|&s;tance <PB N="245" REF="250"> appears to proceed from two cau&s;es, which, though very different, mutually contribute to produce the &s;ame effect. The fir&s;t is the agita|tion of mind occa&s;ioned by the derangement of our internal material &s;en&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ions have an influence on health, and introduce di&s;order into the vital principles. The majority of men lead either a timid or contentious life, and mo&s;t of them die of chagrin. The &s;econd is the im|perfection of tho&s;e of our &s;en&s;es which are analo|gous to appetite. The brute animals di&s;tingui&s;h better what is agreeable to their nature: They are never deceived in the choice of their ali|ment; they never exceed in their plea&s;ures; guided only by the perception of their actual wants, they remain &s;atisfied, and never &s;earch for new &s;ources of gratification. But man, inde|pendent of wi&s;hing for exce&s;s in every article, independent of that ardour with which he &s;eeks to de&s;troy him&s;elf by attempting to force nature, is not &s;o alert in di&s;tingui&s;hing the effects of par|ticular &s;pecies of food. He de&s;pi&s;es &s;imple ali|ment, and prefers compounded di&s;hes, becau&s;e his ta&s;te is corrupted, and becau&s;e he has con|verted the &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure into an in&s;trument of debauchery, which can only be gratified by irritation.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that we are more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es than the brutes, &s;ince we cannot, like them, di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o ea&s;ily what is noxious or &s;alutary to our frame. Our experi|ence, <PB N="246" REF="251"> in this article, is le&s;s certain than their &s;en|timent. Be&s;ides, we even abu&s;e tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of appetite, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in a more perfect degree: In brutes, the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are the means of health and pre&s;ervation; but, in man, they be|come the cau&s;es of malady and de&s;truction. In|temperance alone is more fatal to man than the united force of all the other evils incident to hu|man nature.</P>
<P>By the&s;e con&s;iderations we are led to believe, that the feelings of animals are more determined and more exqui&s;ite than ours; for, though it were allowed that brutes frequently poi&s;on them|&s;elves, it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be granted, that they ne|ver take poi&s;on but when concealed among other food, or when &s;o pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, that they eat whatever is pre&s;ented to them; and many in&s;tances have occurred where animals have peri&s;hed for want, rather than eat what was re|pugnant to their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior &s;trength of &s;entiment in brutes may be &s;till farther proved, by attending to their &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which, in mo&s;t animals, is &s;o powerful, that they &s;mell farther than they &s;ee: They not only &s;cent actual objects at a di&s;tance, but they can trace them by their effluvia long after they are gone. Such a &s;en&s;e is an univer|&s;al organ of perception; it is an eye that &s;ees objects, not only where they are, but where they have been. In a word, it is a &s;en&s;e by which the animal is enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h with certain|ty <PB N="247" REF="252"> what is agreeable to its nature, and by which it perceives what is fitted to gratify its appetite. Hence brute animals enjoy, in a &s;uperior degree, the &s;en&s;es relative to appetite; and, of cour&s;e, have feelings more exqui&s;ite than tho&s;e of men. They are likewi&s;e con&s;cious of their actual ex|i&s;tence; but retain no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their pa&s;t exi&s;tence. This latter propo&s;ition, as well as the fir&s;t, merits con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>In man, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence is compo&s;ed of the perception of actual exi&s;tence, as well as remembrance of pa&s;t exi&s;tence. Remembrance is a perception equally pre&s;ent with the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion; it even &s;ometimes affects us more &s;trongly than actual &s;en&s;ations. As the&s;e two &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ation are different, and as the mind has the faculty of comparing and forming ideas from them, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence is more certain and exten&s;ive, in proportion to the number and frequency of pa&s;t objects recalled by the memory, and to the frequent combining and comparing of them with each other, and with pre&s;ent objects. Each object is accompanied with a certain number of &s;en&s;ations, or different exi&s;tences, relative to the different &s;tates in which it was originally perceived. This number of &s;en&s;ations, by the compari&s;on made between them by the mind, becomes a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or train of ideas. The idea of time, and indeed every other idea, originates from the compari&s;on of our &s;en&s;ations. But this train of ideas, or of <PB N="248" REF="253"> exi&s;tences, often pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us in an order or arrangement very different from that in which our &s;en&s;ations were received. It is the arrange|ment of our ideas that we perceive, and not the order of our &s;en&s;ations; and in this con&s;i&s;t chiefly the differences of character and of ge|nius; for two men, though &s;imilar in organiza|tion, and educated in the &s;ame manner, and though they received their &s;en&s;ations in the &s;ame order, might, notwith&s;tanding, think very dif|ferently. As the temperament of their minds was not the &s;ame, and as each combined and compared &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations in a manner peculiar to him&s;elf, the general re&s;ults of the&s;e compari|&s;ons, or the ideas, genius, and character acqui|red, would likewi&s;e be different.</P>
<P>Some minds are peculiarly active in compa|ring &s;en&s;ations and forming ideas. Such men are always the mo&s;t ingenious, and, if not pre|vented by circum&s;tances, make the mo&s;t brilliant figure in life. There are others, who&s;e minds being more obtu&s;e, allow every &s;en&s;ation to e|&s;cape, but &s;uch as make &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions: The&s;e men have le&s;s genius and vivacity than the former. La&s;tly, there are other men, and the&s;e con&s;titute the multitude, who have &s;o little activity of mind, and &s;o great an aver&s;ion from thinking, that they never compare or combine &s;en&s;ations, at lea&s;t, quickly. The &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t be &s;trong, and repeated a thou&s;and times, before their minds can be rou&s;ed to compare <PB N="249" REF="254"> them, or to form ideas. The&s;e men are exceed|ingly &s;tupid, and only differ from the brutes by the &s;mall number of ideas which their minds have formed with &s;o much labour.</P>
<P>The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence being thus compo&s;ed not only of our actual &s;en&s;ations, but of the train of ideas which re&s;ults from a com|pari&s;on of our &s;en&s;ations, and of our pa&s;t exi&s;t|ences, it is evident, that the more ideas a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he is more certain of his exi&s;tence; that his exi&s;tence is proportioned to his genius; and that, by the power alone of reflection, we are con&s;cious of our former exi&s;tence, and that we will continue to exi&s;t, the idea of future be|ing only the inver&s;e compari&s;on of the pre&s;ent with the pa&s;t; for, in this view, the pre&s;ent is pa&s;t, and the future pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now, the power of reflection being denied to brutes, it is obvious, that they cannot form ideas, and, con&s;equently, that their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their exi&s;tence mu&s;t be le&s;s certain and le&s;s exten&s;ive than ours; for they have no idea of time, no knowledge of the pa&s;t, or of the future. Their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence is &s;imple; it depends &s;olely on the &s;en&s;ations which actually affect them, and con&s;i&s;ts of the internal feelings produced by the&s;e &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>We may, perhaps, acquire &s;ome notion of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence which animals po&s;&s;e&s;s, by reflecting on our own condition, when <PB N="250" REF="255"> &s;trongly occupied with any object, or &s;o vio|lently agitated with pa&s;&s;ion as to preclude every reflex idea of our&s;elves. This condition is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;aying, A man is ab&s;ent, or out of him&s;elf. We are out of our&s;elves when fully immer&s;ed in actual &s;en&s;ations, and e&s;pecially when the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are violent, rapid, and leave the mind no lei&s;ure to reflect. In this &s;tate, we feel every degree of plea&s;ure and pain; we even retain the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence, without any &s;en&s;ible participation of the mind. This condition, in which we have only momen|tary impre&s;&s;ions of our exi&s;tence, is the habitu|al &s;tate of animals; deprived of ideas, and fur|ni&s;hed with &s;en&s;ations, they know not their ex|i&s;tence, but they feel it.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this difference more fully, let us compare the powers and actions of brute ani|mals with tho&s;e of man. Like us, they have &s;en&s;es, and receive impre&s;&s;ions from exernal objects. They have al&s;o an internal &s;en&s;e, an organ which retains the vibrations excited by the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; and, con&s;equently, &s;en&s;ations, which, like ours, may be renewed, and are more or le&s;s &s;trong and durable. Still, however, they have neither imagination, under&s;tanding, nor memory; becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s not the power of comparing their &s;en&s;ations, and becau&s;e the&s;e three faculties of the mind depend upon this power.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="256"> Have brute animals no memory? The con|trary, I &s;hall be told, is demon&s;trably evident: Do they not recollect, after long ab&s;ence, the per&s;ons with whom they have lived, the places where they dwelt, the roads they frequented? Do they not remember the cha&s;ti&s;ements they had &s;uffered, the care&s;&s;es they had received, the le&s;&s;ons they had been taught? Every thing con|curs in &s;howing that, though deprived of imagi|nation and rea&s;on, they po&s;&s;e&s;s an active, exten|&s;ive, and, perhaps, more faithful memory than our own. But, however &s;triking the&s;e appear|ances may be, and however &s;trong the prejudices to which they have given ri&s;e. I imagine it is capable of demon&s;tration that they are deceitful, and that the brutes have no knowledge of pa&s;t events, no idea of time, and, of cour&s;e, no me|mory.</P>
<P>In man, memory originates from the faculty of reflection; for our remembrance of pa&s;t e|vents &s;uppo&s;es not only a continuation of the impre&s;&s;ions made upon the internal material &s;en&s;e, or a renewal of former &s;en&s;ations, but likewi&s;e the compari&s;on the mind makes between its &s;en&s;ations, or the ideas it forms. If memory con&s;i&s;ted not in the renovation of pa&s;t &s;en&s;ations, the&s;e &s;en&s;ations would be repre&s;ented in our in|ternal &s;en&s;e, without leaving any determined impre&s;&s;ions; they would be exhibited without order or connection, like the ravings of per&s;ons mad or intoxicated, where objects are &s;o de|ranged <PB N="252" REF="257"> and confu&s;ed, that no remembrance of them is retained; for we cannot remember things that have no relation to tho&s;e which have preceded or followed them. No i&s;olated &s;en&s;a|tion, however &s;trong, can leave any traces on the mind. Now, it is the mind alone that a&s;cer|tains the relations of objects, by the compari&s;on it makes between them, and connects our &s;en|&s;ations by a continued train of ideas. Memory, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the exi&s;tence of the power by which they are produced.</P>
<P>But, to leave no room for doubt on this im|portant point, let us examine that &s;pecies of re|membrance left by our &s;en&s;ations, when unac|companied with ideas. Pain and plea&s;ure are &s;en&s;ations of the pure&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t kind; yet our recollection of the&s;e feelings is feeble and confu&s;ed. We only remember that we felt plea&s;ure or pain; but our remembrance is indi|&s;tinct: We cannot figure either the &s;pecies, the degree, or the duration of tho&s;e feelings which af|fected us &s;o powerfully; and &s;till le&s;s are we able to have clear ideas of tho&s;e which have been &s;eldom repeated. A violent pain, for example, which is felt but once, continues only a few moments, and differs from all former pains, would nece&s;|&s;arily be &s;oon forgot. We might recollect that we felt a great pain; but, while we di&s;tinctly remembered the circum&s;tances which attended it, <PB N="253" REF="258"> and the time when it happened, we would have only a faint impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;ation it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why is every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in our infancy entirely obliterated? Why do old men recollect what happened in their youthful years better than what occurred during their old age? Can there be a &s;tronger proof that &s;en&s;ations alone are in&s;ufficient for the production of memory, and that it has no exi&s;tence but in the train of ideas which the mind forms from its &s;en&s;ations? In infancy, our &s;en&s;ations are perhaps as lively and rapid as in middle age; yet they leave little or no traces behind them; becau&s;e, at this period, the power of reflection, which alone forms ideas, is almo&s;t totally inactive; and, when it does act, its compari&s;ons are &s;uperficial, and it is incapable of reducing objects to any regular arrangement. At the age of maturity, rea&s;on is fully unfold|ed, becau&s;e the power of reflection is at its me|ridian. We then derive from our &s;en&s;ations all the fruit they can produce, and we form various orders of ideas and chains of thought, each of which, by being frequently revolved, makes an impre&s;&s;ion &s;o deep and indelible, that, when old age arrives, the &s;ame ideas recur with more force than tho&s;e derived from pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations; be|cau&s;e, at that period, our &s;en&s;ations are &s;low and feeble, and the mind it&s;elf participates the lan|guor of the body. Infancy is totally occupied with the pre&s;ent time: In mature years, we en|joy equally the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future; <PB N="254" REF="259"> and, in old age, we have but &s;light feelings of the pre&s;ent, we turn our eyes to futurity, and only live in the pa&s;t. Do not the&s;e differences depend entirely on the arrangement the mind has made of its &s;en&s;ations; and are they not more or le&s;s connected with the faculty we po&s;&s;e&s;s, at different ages, of forming, acquiring, and retain|ing ideas? Neither the prattling of the child, nor the garrulity of old age, have the tone of rea&s;oning, becau&s;e they are equally deficient in ideas; the fir&s;t is yet unable to form them, and the la&s;t has lo&s;t the faculty.</P>
<P>An idiot, who&s;e &s;en&s;es and bodily organs ap|pear to be perfectly &s;ound, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in common with us, every kind of &s;en&s;ation, and, if he li|ved in &s;ociety, and were obliged to act like other men, he would po&s;&s;e&s;s them in the very &s;ame or|der. But, as the&s;e &s;en&s;ations give ri&s;e to no i|deas; as there is no corre&s;pondence between his mind and his body; and, as he has not the facul|ty of reflection; he is, of cour&s;e, deprived of me|mory, and of all knowledge of him&s;elf. With regard to external powers, this man differs not from the brutes; for, though he has a &s;oul, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the principle of rea&s;on, as this principle remains inactive, and receives no intelligence from the bodily organs, it can have no influence on his actions, which, like tho&s;e of the brute animals, are &s;olely determined by his &s;en&s;ations, and by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his actual exi&s;tence and pre&s;ent wants. Thus, an idiot and a brute <PB N="255" REF="260"> are beings who&s;e operations are in every re&s;pect the &s;ame; becau&s;e the latter has no &s;oul, and the former makes no u&s;e of it: Both want the power of reflection, and, con&s;equently, have neither under&s;tanding, imagination, nor memo|ry; but they both po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;en&s;ations, feelings, and the faculty of moving.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall &s;till, however, be a&s;ked, Do not idiots and brutes often act as if they were deter|mined by the knowledge of pa&s;t objects? Do they not recollect the per&s;on with whom they have lived, the places where they dwelt, &amp;c.? Do not the&s;e actions nece&s;&s;arily imply the exer|tions of memory? and, does not this prove that memory flows not from the power of reflec|tion?</P>
<P>The reader ought to recollect, that I have al|ready di&s;tingui&s;hed two &s;pecies of memory, which, though they re&s;emble each other in their effects, proceed from very different cau&s;es: The fir&s;t is occa&s;ioned by the impre&s;&s;ions of our ide|as; and the &s;econd, which I would rather call remini&s;cence than memory, is only a renewal of our &s;en&s;ations, or of the vibrations that produced them. The fir&s;t is an emanation of the mind, and, as already remarked, is more perfect in man than the &s;econd. But the latter is only a renovation of the vibrations of the internal ma|terial &s;en&s;e; and it alone is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by idiots and brute animals. Their former &s;en&s;ations are re|newed by actual &s;en&s;ations; the principal and <PB N="256" REF="261"> pre&s;ent recall the acce&s;&s;ory and pa&s;t images; they feel as they formerly felt, and con&s;equently act as they formerly acted; they perceive the pre&s;ent and the pa&s;t; but they have not the ca|pacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing, or comparing objects, and, of cour&s;e, have no proper knowledge of them.</P>
<P>I am aware that dreams will be adduced as another proof of the memory of brutes. It is undeniable, that the objects which occupy ani|mals when awake, are likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to them during &s;leep. Dogs bark in their &s;leep; and, though this barking be feeble, it is ea&s;y to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the &s;ounds peculiar to the chace, to anger, to de&s;ire, to complaint, &amp;c. It is, therefore, unque|&s;tionable, that dogs have a lively and active me|mory, and very different from what has been a|bove de&s;cribed, &s;ince it acts independent of ex|ternal cau&s;es.</P>
<P>To obviate this difficulty, we mu&s;t examine the nature of dreams, and inquire whether they proceed from the mind, or depend &s;olely on our internal material &s;en&s;e. If we can prove that they re&s;ide entirely in the latter, the objection will not only be removed, but a new demon|&s;tration will be furni&s;hed again&s;t the under&s;tand|ing and memory of brutes.</P>
<P>Idiots, who&s;e minds are totally inactive, dream like other men: Dreams, therefore, are produ|ced independent of the mind. Brute animals, though they have no mind, not only dream, but <PB N="257" REF="262"> I am tempted to think that all dreams are inde|pendent of mind. Let any man reflect upon his dreams, and endeavour to di&s;cover why the parts of them are &s;o ill connected, and the events &s;o ridiculous and ab&s;urd. The chief rea&s;on, I have always thought, proceeds from this circum|&s;tance, that dreams are entirely derived from &s;en|&s;ations, and not from ideas. The idea of time, for example, never enters into dreams: Per&s;ons whom we never &s;aw are repre&s;ented; we even &s;ee tho&s;e who have been long dead in the &s;ame form as when they were alive; but they are al|ways connected with pre&s;ent objects and per&s;ons, or with tho&s;e which are pa&s;t. It is the &s;ame with the idea of place: In dreams we never &s;ee per|&s;ons where they are; objects mu&s;t be &s;een where they are not, or they cannot be perceived at all. If the mind acted, it would in&s;tantly reduce this chaos of &s;en&s;ations to order. But, in&s;tead of acting, the mind generally allows the&s;e illu&s;ory repre&s;entations to &s;ucceed each other in the order they occur; and, though each object appears in lively colours, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is often confu&s;ed, and always chimerical. If, however, the mind be half rou&s;ed by the ab&s;urdity of the repre&s;en|tations, or by the mere force of the &s;en&s;ations, a glimmering of light breaks in upon the dark|ne&s;s, and produces a real idea in the mid&s;t of chimeras; we then begin to dream, or rather to think, that the whole may be only a dream. Though this action be only a feeble exertion of <PB N="258" REF="263"> the mind, it is neither a &s;en&s;ation nor a dream; it is a real thought or reflection; but, as it has not &s;trength enough to di&s;&s;ipate the allu&s;ion, it mixes with, and becomes part of the dream, and allows the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of images to proceed; &s;o that, when we awake, we imagine we have dreamed what we in reality thought.</P>
<P>In dreams we &s;ee much, but &s;eldom under|&s;tand: Though we feel in the mo&s;t lively man|ner, we never rea&s;on: Images and &s;en&s;ations &s;ucceed each other; but the mind never unites or compares them. We have, therefore, &s;en&s;a|tions, but no ideas; for ideas are the re&s;ults of compared &s;en&s;ations. Hence dreams re&s;ide on|ly in the internal material &s;en&s;e; they are pro|duced without the intervention of the mind; and, therefore, con&s;titute a part of that material or purely animal remini&s;cence which we have formerly mentioned. Memory, on the contra|ry, cannot exi&s;t without the idea of time, with|out the actual compari&s;on of former ideas; and, &s;ince ideas enter not into dreams, it is obvious, that they can neither be a con&s;equence, nor an effect, nor a proof of memory. But, though i|deas &s;hould &s;ometimes accompany dreams, though the &s;omnambuli&s;ts, who walk, &s;peak &s;en&s;ibly, an&s;wer que&s;tions, &amp;c. in their &s;leep, &s;hould be quoted to prove that ideas are not &s;o entirely ex|cluded from dreams as I pretend, it is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e that dreams may be produced by the renewal of &s;en&s;ations alone, without the intervention of mind: For then brute animals <PB N="259" REF="264"> can only have dreams of this &s;pecies; and the&s;e dreams, in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of memory, indicate, on the contrary, nothing more than a material remini&s;cence.</P>
<P>I am, however, far from believing that &s;om|nambuli&s;ts are really occupied with ideas: The mind &s;eems to take no part in their actions; for, though they go about and return, they act without reflection or knowledge of their &s;itu|ation. They are neither con&s;cious of the dan|gers nor inconveniencies which accompany their expeditions. The animal faculties are alone em|ployed, and even not the whole of them. A &s;omnambuli&s;t, therefore, is in a more &s;tupid &s;tate than that of an idiot; becau&s;e he exerts only a part of his &s;en&s;es; but an idiot employs the whole, and enjoys exten&s;ively every &s;pecies of feeling: And as to the people who &s;peak during &s;leep, they never &s;ay any thing new. The an|&s;wering &s;ome trivial que&s;tions, the repetition of &s;ome common phra&s;es, prove not the action of the mind: All this may be performed indepen|dent of the thinking principle. Why may not a man a&s;leep &s;peak without thinking, &s;ince per|&s;ons fully awake, e&s;pecially when occupied with pa&s;&s;ion, utter many things without reflection?</P>
<P>With regard to the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of dreams, or the rea&s;on why former &s;en&s;ations are renew|ed, without being excited by pre&s;ent objects, it may be remarked, that we never dream during a profound &s;leep. Every thing is then extin|gui&s;hed; <PB N="260" REF="265"> we &s;leep both externally and internally. But the internal &s;en&s;e &s;leeps la&s;t, and awakes fir&s;t; becau&s;e it is more active, and more &s;u|&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions than the external &s;en&s;es. We dream mo&s;t, when our &s;leep is lea&s;t perfect and profound. Former &s;en&s;ations, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which require no reflection, are renewed. The internal &s;en&s;e, occupied with actual &s;en&s;a|tions, on account of the inactivity of the exter|nal &s;en&s;es, exerci&s;es it&s;elf with its pa&s;t &s;en&s;ations. The &s;tronge&s;t always pre&s;ent them&s;elves fir&s;t; and the &s;tronger they are, the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituations become more keenly intere&s;ting. It is for this rea&s;on that dreams are almo&s;t perpetually either dreadful or ravi&s;hing.</P>
<P>It is not even nece&s;&s;ary that the external &s;en&s;es &s;hould be ab&s;olutely lulled, before the internal &s;en&s;e can exert its independent powers: The &s;imple inaction of the&s;e &s;en&s;es is &s;ufficient to pro|duce this effect. The habit of going to repo&s;e at &s;tated times often prevents us from &s;leeping ea&s;ily. The body and its members are &s;oftly extended without motion; the eyes are involved in darkne&s;s; the tranquility of the place, and the &s;ilence of the night, render the ear u&s;ele&s;s; the other &s;en&s;es are equally inactive; all is in a &s;tate of repo&s;e, but nothing as yet entirely lulled or a&s;leep. In this condition, and when the mind is al&s;o unoccupied with ideas, the internal material &s;en&s;e alone exerts it&s;elf. This is the &s;ea&s;on of illu&s;ive images and fleeting &s;hades. We are a|wake, <PB N="261" REF="266"> and yet we feel the effects of &s;leep. If we be in health and vigour, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of i|mages and illu&s;ions is enchanting. But, when the body is di&s;ordered, or fatigued, the images are of a different nature: We are then torment|ed with hideous and threatening phantoms, which &s;ucceed each other with equal whim&s;icalne&s;s and rapidity. This &s;cene of chimeras may be cal|led a magic lanthorn which fills the brain with illu&s;ions, when void of all other &s;en&s;ations: The objects of this &s;cene are more lively, numerous, and di&s;agreeable, in proportion to the weakne&s;s of the body and delicacy of the nerves; for, the vibrations occa&s;ioned by real &s;en&s;ations being, in a &s;tate of weakne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;e, much &s;tronger and more di&s;agreeable than in a healthy &s;tate, the re|pre&s;entations of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, produced by a renewal of the &s;ame vibrations, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be more lively and painful.</P>
<P>In fine, we remember dreams for the &s;ame rea&s;on that we remember former &s;en&s;ations: The only difference between us and the brutes is, that we can di&s;tingui&s;h dreams from ideas or real &s;en|&s;ations; and this capacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing is a re&s;ult of compari&s;on, an operation of memory, which includes the idea of time. But the brutes, who are deprived of memory and of the faculty of comparing pa&s;t and pre&s;ent time, cannot di|&s;tingui&s;h their dreams from their actual &s;en&s;a|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="267"> In the article concerning the nature of man, I imagine I have proved, in a &s;atisfactory man|ner, that animals po&s;&s;e&s;s not the power of reflec|tion. Now, the under&s;tanding, which is a re|&s;ult of this power, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by two different operations: The fir&s;t is the faculty of comparing &s;en&s;ations, and forming ideas from them; and the &s;econd is the power of comparing the ideas them&s;elves, and forming a chain of rea&s;oning. By the fir&s;t operation, we acquire particular ideas, or the knowledge of &s;en&s;ible ob|jects: By the &s;econd, we form general ideas, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the acqui&s;ition of ab&s;tract truths. The brute animals po&s;&s;e&s;s neither of the&s;e faculties, becau&s;e they have no under&s;tanding; and the under&s;tanding of the bulk of mankind &s;eems to be limited to the fir&s;t of the above ope|rations.</P>
<P>If all men were equally capable of comparing and generalizing ideas, they would equally exhi|bit their ingenuity by new productions, which would be always different from tho&s;e of others, and often more perfect; all men would be en|dowed with inventive powers, or, at lea&s;t, with the capacity of improving and perfecting. But this is by no means the ca&s;e: Reduced to a &s;er|vile imitation, mo&s;t men execute only what they have &s;een performed by others; they think only from memory, and in the &s;ame order as others have thought; their under&s;tanding is limited en|tirely <PB N="263" REF="268"> to form and imitation, and their power of reflecting is too feeble for invention.</P>
<P>Imagination is another faculty of the mind: If, by imagination, we under&s;tand the power of comparing images with ideas, of illuminating our thoughts, of aggrandizing our &s;en&s;ations, of painting our &s;entiments, in a word, of perceiving with rapidity all the qualities and relations of objects, this power is the mo&s;t brilliant and mo&s;t active faculty of the mind, and the brutes are &s;till more devoid of it, than either of under&s;tand|ing or memory. But there is another &s;pecies of imagination, which depends &s;olely on corporeal organs, and is common to us with the brutes, namely, that tumultuary emotion excited by ob|jects analogous or oppo&s;ite to our appetites, that lively and deep impre&s;&s;ion of the images of ob|jects, which perpetually and involuntarily re|curs, and forces us to act, like the brutes, with|out deliberation or reflection. By this repre&s;en|tation of objects, which is more active than their pre&s;ence, every thing is exaggerated, and paint|ed in fal&s;e colours. This &s;pecies of imagination is the grand enemy of the human mind: It is the &s;ource of illu&s;ion, the mother of tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions which, in &s;pite of the efforts of rea&s;on, rule over us, and render us the unhappy theatre of a perpetual combat, in which we are almo&s;t con|&s;tantly vanqui&s;hed.</P>

<PB N="264" REF="269">
<HEAD>HOMO DUPLEX.</HEAD>
<P>The internal man is <HI>double.</HI> He is compo&s;ed of two principles, different in their nature, and oppo&s;ite in their action. The mind, or prin|ciple of all knowledge, wages perpetual war with the other principle, which is purely material. The fir&s;t is a bright luminary, attended with calmne&s;s and &s;erenity, the &s;alutary &s;ource of &s;cience, of rea&s;on, and of wi&s;dom. The other is a fal&s;e light, which &s;hines only in tempe&s;t and ob&s;curity, an impetuous torrent, which involves in its train nothing but pa&s;&s;ion and error.</P>
<P>The animal principle is fir&s;t unfolded. As it is purely material, and con&s;i&s;ts in the duration of vibrations, and the renewal of impre&s;&s;ions formed in the internal material &s;en&s;e, by objects analogous or oppo&s;ite to our appetites, it begins to act, and to guide us, as &s;oon as the body is capable of feeling pain or plea&s;ure. The &s;piri|tual principle appears much later, and is only unfolded and brought to maturity by means of education: It is by the communication of others thoughts alone that the child becomes a thinking and rational creature. Without this communi|cation, it would be &s;tupid or fanta&s;tical, according to the natural inactivity or activity of its internal material &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="270"> Let us view a child when left at full liberty, and removed from the ob&s;ervation of his guide. We may judge of what pa&s;&s;es within him from his external actions. He neither thinks nor re|flects. He follows indifferently every path to plea&s;ure. He obeys all the impre&s;&s;ions of ex|ternal objects. He acts without rea&s;on. Like the young animals, he amu&s;es him&s;elf by run|ning and bodily exerci&s;e. He goes and returns, without de&s;ign or preconceived project. His actions are de&s;ultory, and without order or con|nection. But, when called upon by his parents, or tho&s;e who have learned him to think, he in|&s;tantly compo&s;es him&s;elf, gives a direction to his actions, and &s;hows that he has retained the thoughts which had been communicated to him. The material principle has ab&s;olute &s;way during infancy, and would continue to reign alone through life, if the &s;piritual principle were not unfolded and put in motion by education.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y, by reflection, to perceive the ex|i&s;tence of the&s;e two principles. There are mo|ments, and even hours and days, in which we can di&s;tingui&s;h with certainty both their exi&s;t|ence, and the contrariety of their action. I re|fer to tho&s;e times of indolence, of fatigue, or di&s;gu&s;t, when we are unable to form any deter|mination, when our actions and de&s;ires are dia|metrical oppo&s;ite; to that condition or di&s;ea&s;e called <HI>vapours,</HI> with which the &s;edentary and idle are &s;o often affected. If we examine our&s;elves <PB N="266" REF="271"> when in this &s;tate, we will &s;eem to be divided into two di&s;tinct beings, the fir&s;t of which, or the rational faculty, blames what is done by the &s;econd, but has &s;eldom force enough to overcome it; the latter, on the contrary, being compo&s;ed of all the illu&s;ions of &s;en&s;e and imagination, com|mands, and often overpowers the former, and forces us to act contrary to our judgment, or makes us remain idle, though we have a de&s;ire of acting.</P>
<P>When the rational faculty reigns, a man feels a tranquil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf and his affairs; but he perceives, at the &s;ame time, that this is only acquirable by a kind of involuntary ab&s;trac|tion from the pre&s;ence of the other principle. But, when the irrational principle a&s;&s;umes the dominion, we re&s;ign our&s;elves with ardour to di&s;|&s;ipation, to appetite, and to pa&s;&s;ion, and hardly reflect upon the very objects which occupy us &s;o entirely. In both the&s;e &s;tates, we are happy: In the fir&s;t, we command with &s;atisfaction; and, in the &s;econd, we have &s;till greater plea&s;ure in obeying. As only one of the&s;e principles is then in action, and is not oppo&s;ed by the other, we are &s;en&s;ible of no internal conflict; our exi&s;tence appears to be &s;imple, becau&s;e we feel but one impul&s;e: It is in this unity of action that our happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; for, whenever rea&s;on accu&s;es our pa&s;&s;ions, or when the violence of pa&s;&s;ion makes us hate the admonitions of rea&s;on, we then cea&s;e to be happy; we lo&s;e the unity of <PB N="267" REF="272"> our exi&s;tence, in which alone tranquillity con|&s;i&s;ts; an internal conflict commences; the two per&s;ons oppo&s;e each other; and the two princi|ples manife&s;t them&s;elves by producing doubts, inquietude, and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>We may hence conclude, that the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable of all &s;tates takes place, when the&s;e two &s;overeign powers of human nature exert equally their greate&s;t efforts, and produce an equilibrium. This is that ultimate point of di&s;gu&s;t, which makes a man abhor him&s;elf, and leaves no other de&s;ire but that of cea&s;ing to exi&s;t, no other power but that of arming with fury again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What a dreadful condition! I have painted its darke&s;t &s;hade. But how many black clouds mu&s;t precede? All the &s;ituations adjacent to this &s;tate of equilibrium, mu&s;t be replete with melan|choly, irre&s;olution, and mi&s;ery. Even the body it&s;elf falls a victim to the agitations produced by the&s;e internal conflicts.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of man con&s;i&s;ts in the unity of his internal frame: During infancy, he is happy, becau&s;e the material principle reigns alone, and is in perpetual action. The con&s;traints, remon|&s;trances, and even the cha&s;ti&s;ements of parents, affect not the ba&s;is of happine&s;s in children. No &s;ooner do they obtain their liberty, than they re|&s;ume all the &s;pring and gaiety which they re|ceive from the novelty and vivacity of their &s;en|&s;ations. If a child were entirely left to him&s;elf, <PB N="268" REF="273"> his happine&s;s would be complete; but it would cea&s;e, and be &s;ucceeded with a long train of mi|&s;ery. We are therefore obliged to lay him un|der certain re&s;traints, which frequently make him unea&s;y; but the&s;e tran&s;itory pains are the germs of all his future good.</P>
<P>In youth, when the mental principle begins to act, and might even &s;erve for our guide, a new material &s;en&s;e &s;prings up, and a&s;&s;umes &s;uch an ab&s;olute dominion over all our faculties, that the &s;oul &s;eems to yield it&s;elf a willing victim to the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions excited by this &s;en&s;e. The material principle now gains a more complete command than it formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for it not only &s;ubdues rea&s;on, but perverts it, and employs it as an in&s;trument of gratification: We neither think nor act, but with a view to approve and to &s;atisfy this pa&s;&s;ion. As long as this intoxi|cation continues, we are happy: External oppo|&s;ition and difficulties &s;eem to corroborate the u|nity of this internal principle; they fortify the pa&s;&s;ion; they fill the intervals of languor; they rekindle the flame, and turn all our views to the &s;ame object, and all our powers towards the ac|compli&s;hment of the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>But this happy &s;cene pa&s;&s;es away like a dream; the charm vani&s;hes; and di&s;gu&s;t and a frightful void &s;ucceed the plenitude of agreeable feelings with which we had been occupied. The mind, when rou&s;ed from this lethargy, recogni&s;es it&s;elf with difficulty. It has lo&s;t by &s;lavery the habit <PB N="269" REF="274"> of commanding, together with its &s;trength. It even loves &s;ervitude, and goes in que&s;t of a new tyrant, a fre&s;h object of pa&s;&s;ion, which, in its turn, &s;oon di&s;appears, and is &s;ucceeded by ano|ther, who&s;e duration is &s;till &s;horter. Thus exce&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t continue to multiply; plea&s;ure flies from our embrace; the organs are debilitated, and the material &s;en&s;e, in place of governing, has not even the power to obey. After a youth &s;pent in this manner, nothing remains but an enervated body, a feeble and e&s;&s;eminate mind, and a total incapacity of employing either.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that, in the middle pe|riod of life, men are mo&s;t &s;ubject to tho&s;e lan|guors of mind, that internal malady which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>vapours.</HI> At this age, we &s;till &s;earch after the plea&s;ures of youth. This is the effect of habit, and not of any natu|ral propen&s;ity. In proportion as we advance in years, in&s;tead of plea&s;ure, we more frequently feel the incapacity of enjoyment. Our de&s;ires are &s;o often contradicted by our weakne&s;s, that we condemn both our actions and the pa&s;&s;ions which we wi&s;h in vain to gratify.</P>
<P>It is, be&s;ides, at this age, that cares and &s;olici|tude ari&s;e: We then a&s;&s;ume a certain &s;tate, or, in other words, either from chance or choice, we enter upon a particular cour&s;e of life, which it is always &s;hameful to abandon, and often dange|rous to pur&s;ue. We proceed, therefore, between two rocks equally formidable, contempt and a|ver&s;ion. <PB N="270" REF="275"> The efforts we make to avoid them weaken our powers, and throw a damp upon our &s;pirits: For, after long experience of the inju&s;tice of men, we acquire the habit of regard|ing every individual as nece&s;&s;arily vicious; and, after we are accu&s;tomed to prefer our own re|po&s;e to the opinions of the world, and after the heart, rendered callous by the frequent wounds it has received, has lo&s;t its &s;en&s;ibility, we ea&s;ily arrive at that &s;tate of indifference, that indolent tranquillity, of which we would formerly have been a&s;hamed. Ambition, the mo&s;t powerful motive of elevated minds, which is regarded at a di&s;tance as the noble&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;irable of all objects, and which &s;timulates us to the per|formance of great and u&s;eful actions, has no at|tractions to tho&s;e who have approached it, and proves a vain and deceitful phantom to tho&s;e who fall behind in the pur&s;uit. Indolence takes place of ambition, and &s;eems to offer to all men an ea&s;ier acqui&s;ition of more &s;olid good. But it is preceded by di&s;gu&s;t, and followed by languor, that dreadful tyrant of thinking minds, again&s;t which wi&s;dom has le&s;s influence than folly.</P>
<P>It is hence apparent, that the difficulty of re|conciling man to him&s;elf originates from his be|ing compo&s;ed of two oppo&s;ite principles; and that this is the &s;ource of his incon&s;tancy, irre&s;o|lution, and languor.</P>
<P>Brute animals, on the contrary, who&s;e nature <PB N="271" REF="276"> is &s;imple and purely material, feel no internal conflicts, no remor&s;e, no hopes, no fears.</P>
<P>If we were deprived of under&s;tanding, of me|mory, of genius, and of every faculty of the &s;oul, nothing would remain but the material part, which con&s;titutes us animals. We would &s;till have wants, &s;en&s;ations, plea&s;ure, pain, and even pa&s;&s;ions; for what is pa&s;&s;ion but a &s;trong &s;en&s;ation, which may every moment be renew|ed? Now, our &s;en&s;ations may be renewed in an internal material &s;en&s;e; we would, therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;s all the pa&s;&s;ions, at lea&s;t all tho&s;e which the mind, or principle of intelligence, can nei|ther produce nor foment.</P>
<P>But the great difficulty is to di&s;tingui&s;h clear|ly the pa&s;&s;ions peculiar to man from tho&s;e which are common to him and the brutes. Is it cer|tain, or even probable, that the animals have pa&s;&s;ions? Is it not, on the contrary, agreed, that every pa&s;&s;ion is a &s;trong emotion of the mind? Ought we not, therefore, to &s;earch &s;omewhere el&s;e, than in the &s;piritual principle, for the &s;eeds of pride, of envy, of ambition, of avarice, and of all the other pa&s;&s;ions which govern us?</P>
<P>To me it appears, that every thing which go|verns the mind is extraneous to it; that the principle of intelligence is not the principle of &s;entiment; that the &s;eeds of the pa&s;&s;ions exi&s;t in our appetites; that all illu&s;ions proceed from the &s;en&s;es, and re&s;ide in our internal material &s;en&s;e; that, at fir&s;t, the mind has no participation in <PB N="272" REF="277"> the&s;e illu&s;ions, but by its &s;ilence; and that, when the mind does give any countenance to them, it is &s;ubdued, and, when it a&s;&s;ents, it is totally per|verted.</P>
<P>Let us then di&s;tingui&s;h man's phy&s;ical from his moral pa&s;&s;ions: The one is the cau&s;e; the other the effect. The fir&s;t emotion originates in the internal material &s;en&s;e: The mind may receive, but it cannot produce this emotion. Let us likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h in&s;tantaneous emotions from tho&s;e that are durable, and we &s;hall, at once, perceive, that fear, horror, anger, love, or ra|ther the de&s;ire of enjoyment, are &s;en&s;ations, which, though durable, depend &s;olely on the im|pre&s;&s;ions of objects upon our &s;en&s;es, combined with the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of our former &s;en&s;ations; and, con&s;equently, that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be common to us and the other animals: I &s;ay, that the actual impre&s;&s;ions of objects are combined with the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of our former &s;en&s;ations; for nothing is horrible or alluring, either to man or the brutes, when &s;een for the fir&s;t time. This is fully proven by ex|perience: A young animal will run into the flames the fir&s;t time a fire is pre&s;ented to it. A|nimals acquire experience only by reiterated acts, the impre&s;&s;ions of which remain in their internal &s;en&s;e; and, though their experience be not natural, it is not le&s;s &s;ure, and even renders the animal more circum&s;pect; for a great noi&s;e, a violent motion, an extraordinary figure, &s;ud|denly, <PB N="273" REF="278"> and for the fir&s;t time, &s;een or pre&s;ented, produce in the animal a &s;hock, the effect of which re&s;embles the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of fear: But this feeling is in&s;tantaneous; and, as it cannot be combined with any former &s;en&s;ation, it can only excite a momentary vibration, and not a durable emotion, which the pa&s;&s;ion of fear ne|ce&s;&s;arily implies.</P>
<P>A young inhabitant of the fore&s;t, when &s;ud|denly &s;truck with the &s;ound of a hunter's horn, or with the report of a gun, &s;tarts, bounds, and flies off, &s;olely from the violence of the &s;hock which he felt. But, if this noi&s;e cea&s;es, and has been attended with no injury, the animal recog|ni&s;es the ordinary &s;ilence of nature; he compo&s;es him&s;elf, &s;tops, and returns to his peaceable re|treat. But age and experience &s;oon render him timid and circum&s;pect. If he feels him&s;elf wounded or pur&s;ued, after hearing a particular &s;ound, the painful &s;en&s;ation is pre&s;erved in his internal &s;en&s;e; and, whenever he again hears the &s;ame noi&s;e, the painful &s;en&s;ation is renewed, and, combining with the actual impre&s;&s;ion, pro|duces a durable pa&s;&s;ion, a real fear; the animal flies with all his &s;peed, and often abandons for ever his former abode.</P>
<P>Fear, then, is a pa&s;&s;ion of which brute ani|mals are &s;u&s;ceptible, though they feel not our rational or fore&s;een apprehen&s;ions. The &s;ame remarks apply to horror, anger, and love; though brutes have none of our reflex aver&s;ions, our <PB N="274" REF="279"> durable re&s;entments, or our con&s;tant friend&s;hips. Brute animals po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e primary pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;uppo&s;e no intelligence, no ideas, and are founded only on the experience of &s;entiment, or repeated feelings of plea&s;ure and pain, and a renewal of former &s;en&s;ations of the &s;ame kind. Anger, or natural courage, is remarkable in tho&s;e animals who have exerted their &s;trength, and found it &s;uperior to that of others. Fear is the offspring of weakne&s;s; but love is common to all animals. Love is an innate de&s;ire, the &s;oul of nature, the inexhau&s;tible fountain of exi&s;tence, the germ of perpetuity infu&s;ed by the Almighty into every being that breathes the breath of life. It &s;oftens the mo&s;t ferocious and obdurate hearts, and penetrates them with a genial warmth. It is the &s;ource of all good; by its attractions it unites the mo&s;t &s;avage and brutal tempers, and gives birth to every plea&s;ure. Love! Thou di|vine flame! Why do&s;t thou con&s;titute the hap|pine&s;s of every other being, and bring mi&s;ery to man alone? Becau&s;e this pa&s;&s;ion is only a phy|&s;ical good. Notwith&s;tanding all the pretences of lovers, morality is no ingredient in the com|po&s;ition of love. Wherein does the morality of love con&s;i&s;t? In vanity; the vanity ari&s;ing from the plea&s;ure of conque&s;t, an error which pro|ceeds from our attempts to exalt the importance of love beyond its natural limits; the vanity of exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is always accompa|nied with jealou&s;y, a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o low, that we u|niformly <PB N="275" REF="280"> wi&s;h to conceal it; the vanity proceed|ing from the mode of enjoyment, which only multiplies efforts, without increa&s;ing our plea|&s;ures. There is even a vanity in relinqui&s;hing the object of our attachment, if we fir&s;t wi&s;h to break it off. But, if we are &s;lighted, the humi|liation is dreadful, and turns into de&s;pair, after di&s;covering that we have been long duped and deceived.</P>
<P>Brute animals &s;uffer none of the&s;e mi&s;eries. They &s;earch not after plea&s;ure where it is not to be found. Guided by &s;entiment alone, they are never deceived in their choice. Their de&s;ires are always proportioned to the power of gratifica|tion. They reli&s;h all their enjoyments, and at|tempt not to anticipate or diver&s;ify them. But man, by endeavouring to invent plea&s;ures, de|&s;troys tho&s;e which corre&s;pond to his nature; by attempting to force &s;entiment, he abu&s;es his be|ing, and creates a void in his heart which no|thing can afterwards fill up.</P>
<P>Thus, every thing that is good in love belongs to the brutes as well as to man; and, as if this pa&s;&s;ion could never be pure, the animals even &s;eem to feel a &s;mall portion of jealou&s;y. Jea|lou&s;y, in the human &s;pecies, always implies &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t of our&s;elves, a tacit acknowledgment of our own weakne&s;s. The animals, on the con|trary, &s;eem to be jealous in proportion to their force, ardour, and habits of plea&s;ure; becau&s;e our jealou&s;y proceeds from ideas, and theirs from <PB N="276" REF="281"> &s;entiment. They have enjoyed, and they de&s;ire to enjoy more. They feel their &s;trength, and they beat off all that endeavour to occupy their place. Their jealou&s;y is not the effect of reflec|tion. They turn it not again&s;t the object of their love. They are only jealous of their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But, are animals limited &s;olely to tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions we have de&s;cribed? Are fear, anger, hor|ror, love, and jealou&s;y, the only permanent af|fections they are capable of feeling? To me it appears, that, independent of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, of which natural &s;entiment, or rather the experi|ence of &s;entiment, renders animals &s;u&s;ceptible, they po&s;&s;e&s;s other pa&s;&s;ions, which are commu|nicated to them by education, example, habit, and imitation. They have a &s;pecies of friend|&s;hip, of pride, and of ambition. And though, from what has been &s;aid, it is apparent that the operations they perform are not the effects of thought or reflection; yet, as the habits we have mentioned &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome degree of in|telligence, and to form the &s;hade between man and the brute creation, this &s;ubject merits a careful examination.</P>
<P>Can any thing exceed the attachment of a dog to his ma&s;ter? Some of them have been known to die on the tomb in which he had been laid. But, (not to quote prodigies or he|roes), with what fidelity does the dog attend, follow, and protect his ma&s;ter! With what anxi|ety does he &s;eek his care&s;&s;es! With what doci|cility <PB N="277" REF="282"> and alacrity does he obey him! With what patience does he &s;uffer his ill humour, and even his cha&s;ti&s;ements, though often unju&s;t! With what gentlene&s;s and humility does he endeavour to regain his favour! In a word, what agitation and chagrin does the dog di&s;cover when his ma&s;ter is ab&s;ent; and what exce&s;s of joy on his return! In all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, is it po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take the genuine characters of friend&s;hip? Are the&s;e characters equally &s;trong and ener|getic, even in the human &s;pecies?</P>
<P>This friend&s;hip, however, is the &s;ame with that of a lady for her goldfinch, of a child for its toy, or a dog for its ma&s;ter. Both attach|ments are equally blind and void of reflection: That of animals is only more natural, becau&s;e it ari&s;es from their wants; while that of the other is nothing but an in&s;ipid amu&s;ement, in which the mind has no &s;hare. The&s;e puerile attach|ments are kept alive by habit, and acquire all their &s;trength from a vacancy of brain. A ta&s;te for whims, the wor&s;hip of idols, and, in a word, an attachment to inanimated objects, indicate the highe&s;t degree of &s;tupidity; and yet there are many makers and wor&s;hippers of idols; and many are fond of the &s;oil which they have tilled.</P>
<P>All attachments, therefore, are acquired with|out the intervention of the mind; for they uni|formly ari&s;e when we think lea&s;t, and they ac|quire force, and become habitual, by want of reflection. If an object plea&s;es our &s;en&s;es, we <PB N="278" REF="283"> in&s;tantly love it; and, if this object continues for &s;ome time to occupy our attention, we con|vert it into an idol.</P>
<P>But friend&s;hip nece&s;&s;arily implies the power of reflection. It is of all attachments the mo&s;t worthy of man, and the only one which degrades not his nature. Friend&s;hip is the offspring of rea&s;on. The impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;e have no &s;hare in its production. It is the mind of our friend that we love; and to love a mind, implies that we have one, and that we have employed it in the inve&s;tigation of knowledge, and in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the qualities of different minds. Friend|&s;hip, therefore, &s;uppo&s;es, not only the exi&s;tence of an intelligent principle, but the actual exer|tions of this principle in reflecting and rea&s;on|ing.</P>
<P>Thus friend&s;hip belongs only to man; and, though the brutes may be allowed to have at|tachments, &s;entiment alone is &s;ufficient to attach them to tho&s;e whom they often &s;ee, and by whom they are fed and taken care of. It is &s;till more &s;ufficient to attach them to objects with which they are obliged to be much connected. The attachment of mothers to their young pro|ceeds from their being long occupied in car|rying them in the womb, and in produ|cing and &s;uckling them. In &s;ome &s;pecies of birds, the fathers &s;eem to have an attachment for their offspring, and to provide for the mo|thers during incubation: This attachment ori|ginates from their being employed in building <PB N="279" REF="284"> the ne&s;t, and from the plea&s;ure they receive from the females, which continue in &s;ea&s;on long after impregnation. But, in the other animals, who&s;e &s;ea&s;on of love is &s;hort, whenever it is pa&s;t, the males have no attachment to the females. Where there is no ne&s;t, no common operation to be performed, the fathers, like tho&s;e of Spar|ta, have no regard to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The pride and ambition of animals are effects of their natural courage, or of the &s;entiments a|ri&s;ing from their &s;trength, agility, &amp;c. Large animals &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e the audacious in&s;ults of the &s;maller ones. Their courage and ardour are even capable of being improved by education and example; for they are &s;u&s;ceptible of every thing, except rea&s;on. In general, brute animals can learn to repeat the &s;ame action a thou&s;and times, to perform in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion what they only did by intervals, to continue an action a long time, which they were accu&s;tomed to fini&s;h in an in&s;tant, to do voluntarily what at fir&s;t was the effect of force, to perform habitually what they once executed by chance, and to do, of their own accord, what they &s;ee performed by others. Of all the re&s;ults of the animal ma|chine, that of imitation is the mo&s;t admirable. It is the mo&s;t delicate, as well as the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive principle of action, and makes the neare&s;t approach to thought: And though, in animals, the cau&s;e of it be purely material, its effects have always been a&s;toni&s;hing. Men never admired <PB N="280" REF="285"> the apes, till they &s;aw them imitate human ac|tions. It is not, indeed, an ea&s;y matter to di&s;tin|gui&s;h &s;ome copies from the originals. There are, be&s;ides, &s;o few who can clearly perceive the difference between genuine and counterfeit ac|tions, that, to the bulk of mankind, the apes mu&s;t always excite &s;urpri&s;e and humiliation.</P>
<P>The apes, however, are more remarkable for talents than genius. Though they have the art of imitating human actions, they are &s;till brutes, all of which, in various degrees, po&s;&s;e&s;s the talent of imitation. This talent, in mo&s;t a|nimals, is entirely limited to the actions of their own &s;pecies. But the ape, although he belongs not to the human &s;pecies, is capable of imitating &s;ome of our actions. This power, however, is entirely the effect of his organization. He imi|tates the actions of men, becau&s;e his &s;tructure has a gro&s;s re&s;emblance to the human figure. What originates &s;olely from organization and &s;tructure, is thus ignorantly a&s;cribed, by the vul|gar, to intelligence and genius.</P>
<P>By the relations of motion, a dog learns the habits of his ma&s;ter; by the relations of figure, an ape mimics human ge&s;tures; and, by the re|lations of organization, a goldfinch repeats mu|&s;ical airs, and a parrot imitates &s;peech, which forms the greate&s;t external difference between one man and another, and between man and the other animals; for, by means of language, one man di&s;covers a &s;uperiority of knowledge and <PB N="281" REF="286"> genius, while others expre&s;s by it nothing but confu&s;ed or borrowed ideas; and, in an idiot, or in a parrot, it &s;erves only to mark the la&s;t degree of &s;tupidity, the incapacity, in either, to produce thought or reflection, though both be endowed with proper organs for expre&s;&s;ing what pa&s;&s;es within them.</P>
<P>It is &s;till ea&s;ier to prove that imitation is a re|&s;ult of mere mechani&s;m. The mo&s;t perfect imi|tation depends on the vivacity with which the internal material &s;en&s;e receives the impre&s;&s;ions of objects, and the facility of expre&s;&s;ing them by the aptne&s;s of external organs. Men who&s;e &s;en&s;es are mo&s;t delicate and ea&s;ily affected, and who&s;e members are mo&s;t agile and flexible, make the be&s;t actors, the be&s;t mimics, the be&s;t monkeys. Children, in&s;en&s;ibly, and without re|flection, imitate the actions, the ge&s;tures, and the manners of tho&s;e with whom they live: They are extremely alert in repeating and coun|terfeiting. Mo&s;t young people, though they &s;ee only with the eyes of the body, are very dexte|rous in perceiving ridiculous figures. They are &s;truck with every &s;trange form or new repre&s;en|tation. The impre&s;&s;ion is &s;o &s;trong that they relate it with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and copy it with ea&s;e and with gracefulne&s;s. Children, therefore, po&s;|&s;e&s;s, in a &s;uperior degree, the talent of imitation, which &s;uppo&s;es more perfect organs, and a more happy di&s;po&s;ition of members, to which nothing is &s;o repugnant as a &s;trong do&s;e of good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="287"> Thus, among men, tho&s;e who reflect lea&s;t, have generally the &s;tronge&s;t imitative talents. It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing, that this talent &s;hould appear in tho&s;e animals who have no reflection. They ought even to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in the highe&s;t de|gree of perfection, becau&s;e they have nothing to oppo&s;e its operation, no principle to excite a de|&s;ire of differing from each other. Among men, all the diver&s;ity of character, and variety of ac|tion, proceed entirely from the mind. But brute animals, who have no mind, and con&s;equently are de&s;titute of that principle which can alone give ri&s;e to variety of character, or of per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, mu&s;t, when they re&s;emble each other in organization, or are of the &s;ame &s;pecies, do the &s;ame things in the &s;ame manner, and i|mitate one another more perfectly than one man can imitate the actions of another man. Of cour&s;e, the talent of imitation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the brute animals, &s;o far from implying thought or reflection, proves that they are ab&s;olutely depri|ved of both.</P>
<P>It is, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the education of animals, though &s;hort, is always &s;ucce&s;sful. They &s;oon acquire, by imitation, all the know|ledge of their parents. They not only derive experience from their own feelings, but, by means of imitation, they learn the experience acquired by others. Young animals model them|&s;elves entirely upon the old: They &s;ee the latter approach or fly, when they perceive particular <PB N="283" REF="288"> objects, hear certain &s;ounds, or &s;mell certain odours. At fir&s;t, they approach or fly without any other determining principle but that of imi|tation; and afterwards they approach or fly of their own accord, becau&s;e they have then acqui|red the habit of flying or approaching, whenever they feel the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>Having thus compared man with the brutes, when taken individually, I &s;hall now compare man in &s;ociety with the gregarious tribes, and endeavour to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of that &s;pecies of indu&s;try which is &s;o remarkable in &s;ome ani|mals, even of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t numerous or|ders. What marvellous feats are not daily a|&s;cribed to certain in&s;ects? The talents and wi&s;|dom of the bee are admired with envy: They are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s an art peculiar to them&s;elves, the art of perfect government. A bee-hive, &s;ay the eulogi&s;ts of this in&s;ect, is a republic where every individual labours for the community, where every thing is di&s;tributed and arranged with a fore&s;ight, an equity, and a prudence, that is truly a&s;toni&s;hing: The policy of Athens it&s;elf was not more perfect, or better conducted: The more we examine the&s;e in&s;ects, they exhibit fre&s;h objects of admiration; an unalterable and uni|form &s;y&s;tem of government, a profound re&s;pect for the &s;overeign, an anxious attention to his wellfare and inclinations, an ardent love to their country, an incredible a&s;&s;iduity in labouring for the public good, the greate&s;t di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, <PB N="284" REF="289"> joined to the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, the fine&s;t geo|metry, combined with the mo&s;t elegant architec|ture, &amp;c. But, were I to run over the annals of this republic, and to retail all the incidents in the oeconomy of the&s;e in&s;ects, which have excited the admiration of their hi&s;torians, I &s;hould never come to an end.</P>
<P>Independent of that attachment which men acquire for their favourite &s;ubjects, the more they ob&s;erve, and the le&s;s they rea&s;on, their ad|miration is proportionally augmented. Can any thing be more gratuitous than this blind admira|tion of bees, than the pure republican principles a&s;cribed to them, than that &s;ingular in&s;tinct which rivals the mo&s;t &s;ublime geometry, which &s;olves, without he&s;itation, the difficult problem of <HI>build|ing, in the mo&s;t &s;olid manner, in the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;pace, and with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible oeconomy?</HI> The&s;e eulogies are not only exce&s;&s;ive, but ridi|culous: A bee ought to hold no higher rank in the e&s;timation of a naturali&s;t, than it actually holds in nature. This wonderful republic, there|fore, mu&s;t always appear, in the eye of rea&s;on, to be only an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;mall animals, which have no other relation to man, but that of fur|ni&s;hing him with wax and honey.</P>
<P>I here blame not curio&s;ity, but ab&s;urd excla|mation, and fal&s;e rea&s;oning. To examine the operations of bees, to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of their labours, to de&s;cribe their generation, their metamorpho&s;es, &amp;c. the&s;e are objects worthy the <PB N="285" REF="290"> attention of philo&s;ophers. But it is the morali|ty, and even the theology a&s;cribed to in&s;ects, that I cannot hear with patience: It is the marvel|lous feats fir&s;t invented, and then extolled by naturali&s;ts, which I wi&s;h to examine: It is the in|telligence, the fore&s;ight, and even the knowledge of futurity, which have, with &s;o much com|plai&s;ance, been fal&s;ely lavi&s;hed upon them, that I mu&s;t endeavour to reduce to their ju&s;t value.</P>
<P>The genius of &s;olitary bees, it is allowed on all hands, is va&s;tly inferior to that of the grega|rious &s;pecies; and the talents of tho&s;e which a&s;|&s;ociate in &s;mall troops, are le&s;s con&s;picuous than of tho&s;e that a&s;&s;emble in numerous bodies. Is not this alone &s;ufficient to convince us, that the &s;eeming genius of bees, is nothing but a re&s;ult of pure mechani&s;m, a combination of movements proportioned to numbers, an effect which appears to be complicated, only becau&s;e it depends on millions of individuals? Has not every congru|ity, and even di&s;order it&s;elf, the appearance of harmony, when we are ignorant of the cau&s;e? From apparent order to actual intelligence, there is but one &s;tep; for men are always more di&s;|po&s;ed to admire, than to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, therefore, be admitted, that bees, ta|ken &s;eparately, have le&s;s genius than the dog, the monkey, and mo&s;t other animals: It will likewi&s;e be admitted, that they have le&s;s docility, le&s;s attachment, and le&s;s &s;entiment; and that they po&s;&s;e&s;s fewer qualities relative to tho&s;e of <PB N="286" REF="291"> the human &s;pecies. Hence we ought to acknow|ledge, that their apparent intelligence proceeds &s;olely from the multitude united. This union, however, pre&s;uppo&s;es not intellectual powers; for they unite not from moral views: They find them&s;elves a&s;&s;embled together without their con|&s;ent. This &s;ociety, therefore, is a phy&s;ical a&s;|&s;emblage ordained by Nature, and has no depen|dence on knowledge or rea&s;oning. The mother bee produces at one time, and in the &s;ame place, ten thou&s;and individuals, which, though they were much more &s;tupid than I have &s;uppo&s;ed them, would be obliged, &s;olely for the pre&s;erva|tion of their exi&s;tence, to arrange them&s;elves into &s;ome order. As they all act again&s;t each other with equal forces, &s;uppo&s;ing their fir&s;t move|ments to produce pain, they would &s;oon learn to dimini&s;h this pain, or, in other words, to afford mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance: They, of cour&s;e, would exhi|bit an air of intelligence, and of concurring in the accompli&s;hment of the &s;ame end. A &s;uper|ficial ob&s;erver would in&s;tantly a&s;cribe to them views and talents which they by no means po&s;|&s;e&s;s: He would explain every action: Every o|peration would have its particular motive, and prodigies of rea&s;on would ari&s;e without number; for ten thou&s;and individuals produced at one time, and obliged to live together, mu&s;t all act in the very &s;ame manner; and, if endowed with feeling, they mu&s;t acquire the &s;ame habits, a&s;&s;ume that arrangement which is lea&s;t painful <PB N="287" REF="292"> or mo&s;t ea&s;y to them&s;elves, labour in their hive, return after leaving it, &amp;c. Hence the origin of the many wonderful talents a&s;cribed to bees, &s;uch as their architecture, their geometry, their order, their fore&s;ight, their patrioti&s;m, and, in a word, their republic, the whole of which, as I have proved, has no exi&s;tence but in the imagi|nation of the ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>Is not Nature her&s;elf &s;ufficiently a&s;toni&s;hing, without a&s;cribing to her miracles of our own creation? Are not the works of the Almighty &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate his power? and do we imagine that we can enhance it by our weak|ne&s;s? If po&s;&s;ible, this is the very way to degrade his perfections. Who gives the grande&s;t idea of the &s;upreme Being; he who &s;ees him create the univer&s;e, arrange every exi&s;tence, and found nature upon invariable and perpetual laws; or he who inquires after him, and di&s;covers him conducting and &s;uperintending a republic of bees, and deeply engaged about the manner of fold|ing the wings of a beetle?</P>
<P>Some animals unite into &s;ocieties, which &s;eem to depend on the choice of tho&s;e that compo&s;e them, and, con&s;equently, make a nearer approach to intelligence and de&s;ign than that of the bees, which has no other principle than phy&s;ical nece&s;|&s;ity. The elephants, the beavers, the monkeys, and &s;everal other &s;pecies of animals, a&s;&s;emble in troops, for defending each other, and for the purpo&s;e of carrying on &s;ome common operations. If the&s;e <PB N="288" REF="293"> &s;ocieties were le&s;s di&s;turbed, and, if they could be ob&s;erved with equal ea&s;e as that of the bees, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s di&s;cover wonders of a very dif|ferent nature, which, notwith&s;tanding, would be only effects of phy&s;ical laws. When a multi|tude of animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies are a&s;&s;embled in one place, a particular arrangement, a certain order, and common habits, mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ults<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the hi&s;tory of the deer, rabbit, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Now, every common habit, &s;o far from having intelligence for its cau&s;e, implies nothing more than a blind imitation.</P>
<P>Society, among men, depends le&s;s upon phy|&s;ical than moral relations. His weakne&s;s, his wants, his ignorance, and his curio&s;ity, &s;oon taught him the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ociating: He &s;oon found that &s;olitude was a &s;tate of war and of danger; and he &s;ought for &s;afety, peace, and &s;ociety. He augmented his own power and his knowledge, by uniting them with tho&s;e of his fellow-creatures. This union was the be&s;t u&s;e he ever made of his rational faculties. Man commands the univer&s;e &s;olely becau&s;e he has learned to govern him&s;elf, and to &s;ubmit to the laws of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Every thing has concurred to render man a &s;ocial animal: Though large and poli&s;hed &s;ocie|ties certainly depend upon cu&s;tom, and &s;ome|times on the abu&s;e of rea&s;on, they were unque|&s;tionably preceded by &s;maller a&s;&s;ociations, which had no ba&s;is but that of nature. A family is a <PB N="289" REF="294"> natural &s;ociety, which has deeper and more per|manent foundations, becau&s;e it is accompanied with more wants, and more cau&s;es of attachment. Man differs from the other animals: When he comes into the world, he hardly exi&s;ts. Naked, feeble, and incapable of action, his life depends on the aid of others. The weakne&s;&s;es of in|fancy continue long. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upport is converted into a habit, which, of it&s;elf, is ca|pable of producing a mutual attachment between the child and its parents. But, as the child ad|vances, he gradually acquires more force, and has le&s;s need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The affection of the parents, on the contrary, continues, while that of the child grows daily le&s;s. Thus love de|&s;cends more than it a&s;cends. The attach|ment of the parent becomes exce&s;&s;ive, blind, and invincible; and that of the child remains cold and inactive, till the &s;eeds of gratitude are unfolded by rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus human &s;ociety, even when confined to a &s;ingle family, implies the exi&s;tence of the ra|tional faculty; that of gregarious animals, who &s;eem to unite from choice and convenience, im|plies experience and &s;entiment; and that of in|&s;ects, which, like the bees, are a&s;&s;ociated with|out de&s;ign or motive, implies nothing at all. Whatever may be the effects of this latter a&s;&s;o|ciation, it is clear, that they have neither been fore&s;een nor conceived by the creatures which pro|duced them, and that they re&s;ult &s;olely from the <PB N="290" REF="295"> univer&s;al laws of mechani&s;m e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Almighty. Suppo&s;e ten thou&s;and automatons a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ame place, all endowed with the &s;ame force, and determined, by a perfect re&s;emblance in their external and internal &s;truc|ture, and by a uniformity in their movements, to perform the &s;ame operation, a regular work would be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult. They would exhibit the relations of regularity, of re&s;em|blance, and of po&s;ition; becau&s;e the&s;e depend up|on the relations of motion, which we have &s;up|po&s;ed to be equal and uniform. The relations of juxta-po&s;ition, of exten&s;ion, and of figure, would al&s;o appear; becau&s;e we have &s;uppo&s;ed a given and circum&s;cribed place: And, if we be|&s;tow on the&s;e automatons the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;en&s;ation, ju&s;t as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to make them feel their exi&s;tence, to have a tendency to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to avoid what is hurtful, to de|&s;ire what is agreeable, &amp;c. their operations will be not only regular, proportioned, &s;imilar, and equal, but they will have the air of the highe&s;t &s;ymmetry, &s;olidity, convenience, &amp;c.; becau&s;e, in the proce&s;s of their labours, each of the ten thou&s;and individuals has a&s;&s;umed that arrange|ment which was mo&s;t commodious to it&s;elf, and has, at the &s;ame time, been obliged to act, and to arrange it&s;elf in the manner lea&s;t incommo|dious to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Shall I enforce this argument &s;till farther? The hexagonal cells of the bee, which have been <PB N="291" REF="296"> the &s;ubject of &s;o much admiration, furni&s;h an additional proof of the &s;tupidity of the&s;e in&s;ects: This figure, though extremely regular, is no|thing but a mechanical re&s;ult, which is often exhibited in &s;ome of the mo&s;t rude productions of nature. Cry&s;tals, and &s;everal other &s;tones, as well as particular &s;alts, &amp;c. con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ume this figure. The &s;mall &s;cales in the &s;kin of the rou&s;&s;ette, or great bat, are hexagonal, becau&s;e each &s;cale, when growing, ob&s;tructs the progre&s;s of its neighbour, and tends to occupy as much &s;pace as po&s;&s;ible. We likewi&s;e find the&s;e &s;ame hexagons in the &s;econd &s;tomach of ruminating animals, in certain &s;eeds, cap&s;ules, and flowers, &amp;c. If we fill a ve&s;&s;el with cylindrical grain, and, after filling up the inter&s;tices with water, &s;hut it clo&s;e up, and boil the water, all the&s;e cy|linders will become hexagonal columns. The rea&s;on is obvious, and purely mechanical. Each cylindrical grain tends, by its &s;welling, to occu|py as much &s;pace as po&s;&s;ible; and therefore, by reciprocal compre&s;&s;ion, they nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;ume an hexagonal figure. In the &s;ame manner, each bee endeavours to occupy as much &s;pace as po&s;|&s;ible, in the limited dimen&s;ions of the hive; and, therefore, as the bodies of the bees are cylindri|cal, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make their cells hex|agonal, from the reciprocal ob&s;truction they give to each other.</P>
<P>The genius of bees has been e&s;timated accor|ding to the regularity of their works. Bees are <PB N="292" REF="297"> &s;aid to be more ingenious than wa&s;ps, hornets, &amp;c.; for, though the latter are acquainted with architecture, their fabrics are more rude and ir|regular. But it was not con&s;idered by the abet|tors of this opinion, that the greater or le&s;s re|gularity depends &s;olely on the number and fi|gure, and not on the intelligence of the&s;e crea|tures. In proportion to the greatne&s;s of the number, there are more equal and oppo&s;ite for|ces in action, and, of cour&s;e, more mechanical re&s;traint, and more regularity and apparent per|fection in their works.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e animals, therefore, who mo&s;t re&s;emble man in figure and organization, notwith&s;tand|ing the eulogi&s;ts of in&s;ects, will &s;till remain &s;u|perior to all others, in their internal qualities: And, though the&s;e qualities be infinitely diffe|rent from tho&s;e of man, though they are only, as has been proved, the re&s;ults of experience and feeling; yet they greatly exceed the qualities of in&s;ects. As every operation of nature is con|ducted by &s;hades, or &s;light gradations, a &s;cale may be formed for a&s;certaining the intrin&s;ic qua|lities of every animal, by taking, for the fir&s;t point, the material part of man, and by placing the animals &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at different di&s;tances, in proportion as they approach or recede from that point, either in external form, or internal orga|nization. Agreeable to this &s;cale, the monkey, the dog, the elephant, and other quadrupeds, will hold the fir&s;t rank; the cetaceous animals, <PB N="293" REF="298"> who, like the quadrupeds, con&s;i&s;t of fle&s;h and blood, and are viviparous, will hold the &s;econd; the birds, the third, becau&s;e they differ more from man than the quadrupeds or cetaceous a|nimals; and, were it not for oi&s;ters and polypi, which &s;eem to be the farthe&s;t removed from man, the in&s;ects would be thrown into the low|e&s;t rank of animated beings.</P>
<P>But, if the animals be deprived of under&s;tand|ing, of genius, of memory, and of all intelli|gence; if their faculties depend on their &s;en&s;es, and be limited entirely to the exerci&s;e of expe|rience and of feeling, how can we account for that &s;pecies of fore&s;ight which &s;ome of them &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s? Could feelings alone determine them to ama&s;s provi&s;ions in &s;ummer to nouri&s;h them during the rigours of winter? Does not this im|ply a compari&s;on of time, a rational anxiety concerning their future comfort and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; Why do birds build ne&s;ts, if they know not that they will be u&s;eful for depo&s;iting their eggs and rearing their young? It is unnece&s;&s;ary to multi|ply facts of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Before &s;olving the&s;e que&s;tions, or rea&s;oning concerning the above and &s;imilar facts, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain their reality: In&s;tead of be|ing retailed by lovers of the marvellous, if they had been examined by men of &s;en&s;e, and collect|ed by philo&s;ophers, I am per&s;uaded, that all the&s;e pretended miracles would have &s;oon di&s;appeared, and that, by cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reflection, the <PB N="294" REF="299"> cau&s;e of each particular fact might have been di&s;covered. But, let us admit the truth of all the&s;e facts; let us allow to the animals fore&s;ight, and even a knowledge of the future, can this be a&s;cribed to their intellectual powers? If this were really the ca&s;e, their intelligence would be great|ly &s;uperior to ours: For our fore&s;ight is entire|ly conjectural; our notions concerning futurity are always doubtful, and founded on probabi|lities. Hence brute animals, who &s;ee the future with certainty, &s;ince they determine before hand, and are never deceived, would be endowed with a principle of knowledge &s;uperior to the human mind. I a&s;k, whether this conclu&s;ion be not equally repugnant to religion and to rea&s;on?</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that the brutes have a certain knowledge of the future from an in|tellectual principle &s;imilar to ours. Why, then, a&s;cribe to them, upon &s;uch &s;light grounds, a quality &s;o &s;ublime? Why unnece&s;&s;arily degrade the human &s;pecies? Is it not le&s;s unrea&s;onable to refer the cau&s;e to mechanical laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed, like the other laws of nature, by the will of the Creator? The certainty with which animals are &s;uppo&s;ed to act, and the &s;tability and uniformity of their determinations, &s;ufficiently evince them to be the effects of pure mechani&s;m. To doubt, to deliberate, to compare, are the e&s;&s;ential cha|racters of rea&s;on. But movements and actions which are always deci&s;ive, and always certain, <PB N="295" REF="300"> indicate, at the &s;ame time, both mechani&s;m and &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>But, as the laws of nature are only general effects, and, as the facts in que&s;tion are limited and particular, it would be le&s;s philo&s;ophic, and more unworthy of the ideas we ought to enter|tain of the Creator, to embarra&s;s his will thus gratuitou&s;ly with a va&s;t number of petty &s;tatutes, of which one mu&s;t be enacted for bees, another for owls, a third for field-mice, &amp;c. Should we not, on the contrary, exert all our efforts to reduce the&s;e particular effects to more general ones? And if that be impo&s;&s;ible, let us record them, and wait patiently till new facts and new analogies enable us to inve&s;tigate their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Let us, however, examine if the&s;e facts be &s;o inexplicable and &s;o marvellous, or even if they be properly authenticated. The fore&s;ight a|&s;cribed to ants is now di&s;covered to be a vulgar error. They remain in a torpid &s;tate during winter. Their provi&s;ions, therefore, are only a &s;uperfluous ma&s;s, collected without de&s;ign, and without any knowledge of the future; for, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of this knowledge, they would be endowed with the faculty of fore&s;eeing what was perfectly u&s;ele&s;s. Is it not natural for ani|mals, that have a fixed abode, to which they are accu&s;tomed to tran&s;port their provi&s;ions, to col|lect more than they can con&s;ume? Is not feel|ing alone, guided by the habit they have acqui|red of tran&s;porting their food, in order that they <PB N="296" REF="301"> may u&s;e it in tranquillity, &s;ufficient to account for this phaenomenon? Does not this demon|&s;trate that they are only endowed with feeling, and not with rea&s;on? For the &s;ame rea&s;on, bees collect more wax and honey then they have oc|ca&s;ion for: Man profits not, therefore, by their intelligence, but by their &s;tupidity. Intelligence would nece&s;&s;arily determine them to collect no more than they could con&s;ume, and to &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of ama&s;&s;ing a &s;uperfluous quantity, e&s;pecially after they learn from expe|rience, that this labour is lo&s;t, that the overplus is uniformly taken from them, and that this a|bundance is the &s;ole cau&s;e of the de&s;olation and de&s;truction of their &s;ociety. What demon&s;trates this &s;uperfluous labour to be the effect of feeling alone is, that we can oblige them to work as much as we plea&s;e. As long as there are flowers in any country, the bee continues to extract from them honey and wax. If bees were tran&s;|ported from one region to another, &s;o as to af|ford them a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h flowers, their labours would never cea&s;e. The ama&s;&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition of the bee, therefore, is not an effect of fore&s;ight, but a movement produced by feel|ing; and this movement is continued as long as the objects which give ri&s;e to it exi&s;t.</P>
<P>I have be&s;towed particular attention on the oeconomy of field-mice. Their holes are ge|nerally divided into two apartments; in one of them they depo&s;it their young, and, in the <PB N="297" REF="302"> other, every thing that is agreeable to their pa|lates. When made by them&s;elves, their holes are not large, and can receive only a &s;mall quan|tity of provi&s;ions: But, when they find a large &s;pace under the trunk of a tree, there they take up their abode, and fill it with all the grain, nuts, &amp;c. they can collect. Hence the quan|tity of provi&s;ions ama&s;&s;ed, in&s;tead of being pro|portioned to the wants of the animal, depend entirely on the capacity of the place where they happen to be depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>Thus the provi&s;ions of the ant, of the field|mou&s;e, and of the bee, are di&s;covered to be on|ly u&s;ele&s;s and di&s;proportioned ma&s;&s;es, collected without any view to futurity, and the minute and particular laws of their pretended fore&s;ight are reduced to the general and real law of feel|ing. The &s;agacity and fore&s;ight a&s;cribed to birds originate from the &s;ame cau&s;e. To account for the con&s;truction of their ne&s;ts, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to a particular law e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Almighty in their favour. To this ope|ration they are led by degrees. They fir&s;t find a proper place, and then bring materials to ren|der it more commodious. The ne&s;t is only a place which they can di&s;tingui&s;h from all others, and where they can live in tranquillity. Love is the &s;entiment that &s;timulates and directs them in this operation. The male and female require the aid of each other. They feel a &s;trong mu|tual attachment; they endeavour to conceal <PB N="298" REF="303"> them&s;elves, and to retire from the re&s;t of the world, which is now become more dangerous to them than ever. They, therefore, retreat to the fore&s;t, to places the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and inac|ce&s;&s;ible; and, to render their &s;ituation more comfortable, they collect &s;traw, leaves, &amp;c. and form them, with ince&s;&s;ant labour, into a common habitation. Some, le&s;s dexterous or le&s;s &s;en&s;ual, make coar&s;e and rude ne&s;ts; others, contented with what they find already made, have no o|ther habitation than the holes they meet with, or the ne&s;ts which are pre&s;ented to them. All tho&s;e operations are effects of organization, and de|pend upon feeling, which, however exqui&s;ite in degree, can never produce rea&s;oning; and &s;till le&s;s can it produce that intuitive fore&s;ight, that certain knowledge of futurity, which have been a&s;cribed to the feathered tribes.</P>
<P>This doctrine may be farther proved by a few familiar examples. Birds, in&s;tead of knowing the future, are even ignorant of what is pa&s;t. A hen cannot di&s;tingui&s;h her own eggs from tho&s;e of another bird. She perceives not that the young ducks whom &s;he has hatched belong not to her. She broods over chalk eggs, from which nothing can be produced, with equal in|du&s;try as if they were her own. She has no knowledge, therefore, either of the pa&s;t or the future, and is &s;till more deceived with regard to the pre&s;ent. Why do not dome&s;tic poultry make ne&s;ts as well as other birds? Is it becau&s;e <PB N="299" REF="304"> the male belongs to many females? or rather, is it not becau&s;e, being accu&s;tomed to be out of the reach of inconvenience and danger, they have no occa&s;ion to conceal them&s;elves, no habit of &s;eeking for &s;afety in retreat and &s;olitude? This admits of proof by facts; for wild birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies perform actions which are entirely neglected when in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. The wild duck and wood-hen build ne&s;ts; but none are made by the&s;e birds when dome&s;ticated. The ne&s;ts of birds, therefore, the cells of bees, the collections of food laid up by the ant, the field|mou&s;e, &amp;c. &s;uppo&s;e not any intelligence in tho&s;e animals, nor proceed from particular laws e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for each &s;pecies, but depend, like every other animal operation, on number, figure, mo|tion, organization, and feeling, which are gene|ral of laws of nature, and common to all animated beings.</P>
<P>It is by no means a&s;toni&s;hing that man, who is &s;o little acquainted with him&s;elf, who &s;o often confounds his &s;en&s;ations and ideas, who &s;o &s;el|dom di&s;tingui&s;hes the productions of the mind from tho&s;e of the brain, &s;hould compare him&s;elf to the brute animals, and make the only diffe|rence between them con&s;i&s;t in the greater or le&s;s perfection of their organs: It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that he &s;hould make them rea&s;on, under&s;tand, and determine in the &s;ame manner with him&s;elf; and that he &s;hould attribute to them not only tho&s;e qualities which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, but even tho&s;e <PB N="300" REF="305"> of which he is deprived. Let man, however, examine, analyze, and contemplate him&s;elf, and he will &s;oon di&s;cover the dignity of his being; he will perceive the exi&s;tence of his &s;oul; he will cea&s;e to degrade his nature; he will &s;ee, at one glance, the infinite di&s;tance placed by the Supreme Being between him and the brutes.</P>
<P>God alone knows the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future. Man, who&s;e exi&s;tence continues but a few moments, perceives only the&s;e mo|ments: But a living and immortal power compares the&s;e moments, di&s;tingui&s;hes and ar|ranges them. It is by this power that man knows the pre&s;ent, judges of the pa&s;t, and fore&s;ees the future. Deprive him of this divine light, and you deface and ob&s;cure his being; no|thing will remain but an animal equally igno|rant of the pa&s;t and the future, and affectable only by pre&s;ent objects.</P>

<PB REF="306">
<HEAD>OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>MAN changes the natural condition of ani|mals, by forcing them to obey and to &s;erve him. A dome&s;tic animal is a &s;lave de&s;ti|ned to the amu&s;ement, or to aid the operations of men. The abu&s;es to which he is too fre|quently &s;ubjected, joined to the unnatural mode of his living, induce great alterations both in his manners and di&s;po&s;itions. But a &s;avage animal, obedient to Nature alone, knows no laws but tho&s;e of appetite and independence. Thus the hi&s;tory of &s;avage animals is limited to a &s;mall number of facts, the re&s;ults of pure Nature. But the hi&s;tory of dome&s;tic animals is complicated, and warped with every thing relative to the arts employed in taming and &s;ubduing the native wildne&s;s of their tempers: And, as we are ig|norant what influence habit, re&s;traint, and ex|ample, may have in changing the manners, de|terminations, movements, and inclinations of a|nimals, it is the duty of the naturali&s;t to exa|mine them with care, and to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e facts which depend &s;olely on in&s;tinct, from tho&s;e that originate from education; to a&s;certain what is proper to them from what is borrowed; to &s;eparate artifice from nature; and never to con|found <PB N="302" REF="307"> the animal with the &s;lave, the bea&s;t of burden with the creature of God.</P>
<P>Man holds a legitimate dominion over the brute animals, which no revolution can de&s;troy. It is the dominion of mind over matter; a right of nature founded upon unalterable laws, a gift of the Almighty, by which man is enabled at all times to perceive the dignity of his being: For his power is not derived from his being the mo&s;t perfect, the &s;tronge&s;t, or the mo&s;t dexterous of all animals. If he hold only the fir&s;t rank in the order of animals, the inferior tribes would unite, and di&s;pute his title to &s;overeignty. But man reigns and commands from the &s;uperiority of his nature: He thinks; and therefore he is ma&s;ter of all beings who are not endowed with this ine&s;timable talent. Material bodies are likewi&s;e &s;ubject to his power: To his will they can oppo&s;e only a gro&s;s re&s;i&s;tance, or an ob&s;tinate inflexibility, which his hand is always able to o|vercome, by making them act again&s;t each other. He is ma&s;ter of the vegetable tribes, which, by his indu&s;try, he can, at plea&s;ure, augment or di|mini&s;h, multiply or de&s;troy. He reigns over the animal creation; becau&s;e, like them, he is not only endowed with &s;entiment and the power of motion, but becau&s;e he thinks, di&s;tingui&s;hes ends and means, directs his actions, concerts his operations, overcomes force by ingenuity, and &s;wiftne&s;s by per&s;everance.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="308"> Among animals, however, &s;ome are more &s;oft and gentle, others more &s;avage and ferocious. When we compare the docility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper of the dog with the fiercene&s;s and rapa|city of the tigre, the one appears to be the friend, and the other the enemy of man. Thus his empire over the animals is not ab&s;olute. Many &s;pecies elude his power, by the rapidity of their flight, by the &s;wiftne&s;s of their cour&s;e, by the ob&s;curity of their retreats, by the element which they inhabit: Others e&s;cape him by the minutene&s;s of their bodies; and others, in&s;tead of acknowledging their &s;overeign, attack him with open ho&s;tility. He is likewi&s;e in&s;ulted with the &s;tings of in&s;ects, and the poi&s;onous bites of &s;erpents; and he is often incommoded with im|pure and u&s;ele&s;s creatures, which &s;eem to exi&s;t for no other purpo&s;e but to form the &s;hade between good and evil, and to make man feel how little, &s;ince his fall, he is re&s;pected.</P>
<P>But the empire of God mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the limited dominion of man. God, the creator of all being, is the &s;ole governour of na|ture. Man has no influence on the univer&s;e, the motions of the heavenly bodies, or the revo|lutions of the globe which he inhabits. He has no general dominion over animals, vegetables, or minerals. His power extends not to &s;pecies, but is limited to individuals; for &s;pecies and the great body of matter belongs to, or rather con&s;ti|tutes Nature. Every thing moves on, peri&s;hes, <PB N="304" REF="309"> or is renewed by an irre&s;i&s;tible power. Man him&s;elf, hurried along by the torrent of time, cannot prolong his exi&s;tence. Connected, by means of his body, to matter, he is forced to &s;ubmit to the univer&s;al law, and, like all other organized beings, he is born, grows, and peri&s;hes.</P>
<P>But the ray of divinity with which man is animated, ennobles and elevates him above every material exi&s;tence. This &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o far from being &s;ubject to matter, is entitled to govern it; and though the mind cannot com|mand the whole of nature, &s;he rules over indi|vidual beings. God, the &s;ource of all light and of all intelligence, governs the univer&s;e, and e|very &s;pecies, with infinite power: Man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only a ray of this intelligence, enjoys, accordingly, a power limited to individuals, and to &s;mall portions of matter.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that man has been enabled to &s;ubdue the animal creation, not by force, or the other qualities of matter, but by the powers of his mind. In the fir&s;t ages of the world, all animals were equally independent. Man, after he became criminal and &s;avage, was not in a condition to tame them. Before he could di&s;tingui&s;h, choice, and reduce animals to a dome&s;tic &s;tate, before he could in&s;truct and command them, he behoved to be civilized him|&s;elf; and the empire over the animals, like all other empires, could not be e&s;tabli&s;hed previous to the in&s;titution of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="310"> Man derives all his power from &s;ociety, which matures his rea&s;on, exerci&s;es his genius, and u|nites his force. Before the formation of &s;ociety, man was perhaps the mo&s;t &s;avage and the lea&s;t formidable of all animals. Naked, without &s;hel|ter, and de&s;titute of arms, the earth was to him only a va&s;t de&s;ert peopled with mon&s;ters, of which he often became the prey: And, even long after this period, hi&s;tory informs us, that the fir&s;t heroes were only de&s;troyers of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>But, when the human &s;pecies multiplied and &s;pread over the earth, and when, by means of &s;ociety and the arts, man was enabled to conquer the univer&s;e, he made the wild bea&s;ts gradually retire; he purged the earth of tho&s;e gigantic animals, who&s;e enormous bones are &s;till to be found; he de&s;troyed, or reduced to a &s;mall num|ber, the voracious and hurtful &s;pecies; he op|po&s;ed one animal to another; and, &s;ubduing &s;ome by addre&s;s, and others by force, and at|tacking all by rea&s;on and art, he acquired to him&s;elf perfect &s;ecurity, and e&s;tabli&s;hed an em|pire, which knows no other limits than inacce&s;|&s;ible &s;olitudes, burning &s;ands, frozen mountains, or dark caverns, which &s;erve as retreats to a few &s;pecies of ferocious animals.</P>

<P>THE reduction of the hor&s;e to a dome&s;tic &s;tate, is the greate&s;t acqui&s;ition, from the animal world, ever made by the art and indu|&s;try of man. This noble animal partakes of the fatigues of war, and &s;eems to feel the glory of victory. Equally intrepid as his ma&s;ter, he en|counters danger and death with ardour and magnanimity. He delights in the noi&s;e and tu|mult of arms, and annoys the enemy with re&s;o|lution and alacrity. But it is not in perils and conflicts alone that the hor&s;e willingly co-ope|rates with his ma&s;ter; he likewi&s;e participates of human plea&s;ures. He exults in the chace and the tournament; his eyes &s;parkle with e|mulation in the cour&s;e. But, though bold and intrepid, he &s;uffers not him&s;elf to be carried off by a furious ardour; he repre&s;&s;es his movements, and knows how to govern and check the natu|ral <PB N="307" REF="312"> vivacity and fire of his temper. He not on|ly yields to the hand, but &s;eems to con&s;ult the inclination of the rider. Uniformly obedient to the impre&s;&s;ions he receives, he flies or &s;tops, and regulates his motions entirely by the will of his ma&s;ter. He, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, renounces his very exi&s;tence to the plea&s;ure of man. He delivers up his whole powers; he re&s;erves no|thing, and often dies rather than di&s;obey the mandates of his governour.</P>
<P>The&s;e are features in the character of the hor&s;e who&s;e natural qualities have been matured by art, and tamed with care to the &s;ervice of man. His education commences with the lo&s;s of liber|ty, and is completed by re&s;traint. The &s;lavery of the hor&s;e is &s;o antient and &s;o univer&s;al, that he is rarely &s;een in a natural &s;tate. When em|ployed in labour, he is always covered with the harne&s;s; and, even during the time de&s;tined for repo&s;e, he is never entirely delivered from bonds. If &s;ometimes permitted to roam in the pa&s;tures, he always bears the marks of &s;ervitude, and of|ten the external impre&s;&s;ions of labour and pain. His mouth is deformed by the perpetual friction of the bit; his &s;ides are galled with wounds, or furrowed with cicatrices; and his hoofs are pierced with nails. The natural ge&s;tures of his body are con&s;trained by the habitual pre&s;&s;ure of fetters, from which it would be in vain to deli|ver him; for he would not be more at liberty. Tho&s;e hor&s;es, the &s;ervitude of which is mo&s;t <PB N="308" REF="313"> mild, which are kept &s;olely for the purpo&s;es of luxury and magnificence, and who&s;e golden chains only gratify the vanity of their ma&s;ters, are more di&s;honoured by the elegance of their trappings, and by the plaits of their hair, than by the iron &s;hoes on their feet.</P>
<P>Art is always excelled by nature; and, in a|nimated beings, liberty of movement con&s;titutes the perfection of their exi&s;tence. Examine tho&s;e hor&s;es which have multiplied &s;o prodigiou&s;ly in Spani&s;h America, and live in perfect freedom. Their motions are neither con&s;trained nor mea|&s;ured. Proud of their independence, they fly from the pre&s;ence of man, and di&s;dain all his care. They &s;earch for, and procure the food that is mo&s;t &s;alutary and agreeable. They wan|der and fri&s;k about in immen&s;e meadows, and collect the fre&s;h productions of a perpetual &s;pring. Without any fixed habitation, or other &s;helter than a &s;erene &s;ky, they breathe a purer air than in tho&s;e mu&s;ty vaults in which we con|fine them, when &s;ubjected to our dominion. Hence wild hor&s;es are &s;tronger, lighter, and more nervous than mo&s;t of tho&s;e which are in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. The former po&s;&s;e&s;s force and dignity, which are the gifts of nature; the lat|ter have only addre&s;s and gracefulne&s;s, which are all that art can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The&s;e wild hor&s;es are by no means feroci|ous in their temper; they are only wild and fiery. Though of &s;trength &s;uperior to mo&s;t ani|mals, <PB N="309" REF="314"> they never make an attack. But, when they are a&s;&s;aulted, they either di&s;dain the enemy, fri&s;k out of his way, or &s;trike him dead with their heels. They a&s;&s;ociate in troops from no other motive than the plea&s;ure of being toge|ther; for they have no fear; but acquire a mu|tual attachment to each other. As gra&s;s and vegetables con&s;titute their food, of which they have enough to &s;atisfy their appetite, and, as they are not carnivorous, they neither make war with other animals, nor among them&s;elves. They di&s;pute not about their common nouri&s;h|ment, and never have occa&s;ion to &s;natch prey from each other, the general &s;ource of quarrels and combats among the rapacious tribes. Hence they live in perpetual peace; becau&s;e their appe|tites are &s;imple and moderate, and they have no objects to excite envy.</P>
<P>All the&s;e features are apparent in young hor|&s;es, bred together in troops. Their manners are gentle, and their tempers &s;ocial; their force and ardour are generally rendered con&s;picuous by marks of emulation. They anxiou&s;ly pre&s;s to be foremo&s;t in the cour&s;e, to brave danger in traver&s;ing a river, or in leaping a ditch or pre|cipice; and, it has been remarked, that tho&s;e which are mo&s;t adventurous and expert in the&s;e natural exerci&s;es, are the mo&s;t generous, mild, and tractable, when reduced to a dome&s;tic &s;tate.</P>
<P>Wild hor&s;es are mentioned by &s;everal antient authors. Herodotus takes notice of white &s;a|vage <PB N="310" REF="315"> hor&s;es on the banks of the Hypanis in Scythia; and, in the northern part of Thrace, beyond the Danube, he remarks, there were wild hor&s;es, covered all over with hair, five inches long. Ari&s;totle &s;ays, they were to be found in Syria; Pliny, in the northern regions; and Stra|bo, in Spain and the Alps. Among the mo|derns, Cardan &s;ays the &s;ame thing of Scotland, and the Orkney i&s;les<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. de quadrup. &s;oliped. lib. 1. p. 19.</NOTE>; Olaus, of Mu&s;covy; Dapper, of the i&s;land of Cyprus, where he &s;ays, there were beautiful wild hor&s;es, of great &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See la de&s;cript. des i&s;les de l'Archipel. p. 50.</NOTE>; and Struys, of the i&s;land of May, one of the Cape de Verds, where he &s;aw wild hor&s;es of a &s;mall &s;tature<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Struys, tom. 1. p. 11.</NOTE>. Leo of Africa likewi&s;e relates, that there were wild hor&s;es in the de&s;erts of Africa and Arabia; and he a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;aw, in the &s;olitudes of Numidia, a colt with white hair, and a cri&s;ped mane<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. Africae, part 2. vol. 2. p. 750.</NOTE>. Marmol confirms this fact, by inform|ing us, that &s;mall wild hor&s;es, &s;ome of them of an a&s;h-colour, and others white, with &s;hort curl|ed hair and manes, are to be found in the Ly|bian and Arabian de&s;erts<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 50.</NOTE>: He adds, that they out-run the dogs and dome&s;tic hor&s;es. We likewi&s;e learn, from the Lettres Edifiantes<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Lettres Edifiantes, recueil 26. p. 371.</NOTE>, that there are &s;mall wild hor&s;es in China.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="316"> But, as Europe is now almo&s;t equally peopled, wild hor&s;es are no where to be found in this quarter of the globe. Tho&s;e in America are the offspring of dome&s;tic hor&s;es, tran&s;ported origi|nally from Europe by the Spaniards. In the&s;e uninhabited, or rather depopulated regions, hor|&s;es have multiplied prodigiou&s;ly. That this &s;pecies of animal was unknown in the New World, appears from the terror and a&s;toni&s;h|ment expre&s;&s;ed by the Mexicans and Peruvians at the &s;ight of hor&s;es and their riders. The Spaniards carried great numbers of hor&s;es to the&s;e regions, both with a view to their &s;er|vice, and to the propagation of the breed. Ma|ny were, accordingly, left on the i&s;lands, as well as on the Continent, where they have multiplied like other wild animals. M. le Salle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les dernieris decouvertes dans l'Amer. &s;epten. de M. de Salle, p. 250.</NOTE>, in the year 1685, &s;aw, near the bay of St Louis, in North America, the&s;e hor&s;es grazing in the mea|dows; and they were &s;o wild that he could not approach them. The author of the hi&s;tory of the Bucaniers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. des avantur. flibu&s;tiers, tom. 1. p. 110.</NOTE> remarks, 'That troops of hor|&s;es, to the number of 500, are &s;ometimes &s;een in the i&s;land of St Domingo, who all run to|gether; that, when they perceive a man, they all &s;top; and that one of them approaches to a certain di&s;tance, blows through his no&s;trils, takes flight, and is in&s;tantly followed by the <PB N="312" REF="317"> whole troop.' He adds, that he is uncertain whether the&s;e hor&s;es have degenared by be|coming wild; but that he found none of them &s;o hand&s;ome as tho&s;e of Spain, though they &s;prung from the &s;ame race. 'They have,' he continues, 'very gro&s;s heads and limbs, and long necks and ears. The inhabitants tame them with ea&s;e, and then train them to labour. In taking them, gins of ropes are laid in the places where they frequent. When caught by the neck, they &s;oon &s;trangle them&s;elves, unle&s;s &s;ome per&s;on arrives to di&s;entangle them. They are tied to trees by the body and limbs, where they are left for two days without victuals or drink. This trial is generally &s;ufficient for rendering them more tractable, and they &s;oon become as gentle as if they had never been wild; and, even if they &s;hould by accident re|gain their liberty, they never re&s;ume their &s;a|vage &s;tate, but know their ma&s;ters, and allow them&s;elves to be approached, and retaken with ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Garfault mentions another method of taming wild hor&s;es. 
<Q>'When the colts,' he ob&s;erves, 'are not very early tamed, it &s;ometimes happens, that the approach of man &s;trikes them with terror; that they defend them&s;elves with their heels and teeth, in &s;uch a manner, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to dre&s;s or &s;hoe them: If not broke by gentlene&s;s and patience, they are prevented from &s;leeping till they fall down with weakne&s;s. During this operation, a man con|tinues, day and night, at their heads, giving them, from time to time, handfuls of hay. When treated in this man|ner, it is a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;oon their tempers are &s;oftened. Some hor&s;es, however, require to be kept awake for eight days.'</Q> See Nouveau parfait Mar&eacute;chal, p. 89.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="318"> The&s;e facts prove hor&s;es to be naturally of gentle di&s;po&s;itions, and much di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;o|ciate with man. They never for&s;ake the abodes of men, to regain their liberty in the fore&s;ts. They di&s;cover, on the contrary, great anxiety to return to the &s;table, where they find only coar&s;e food, which is always the &s;ame, and of|ten mea&s;ured to them more by the rules of oe|conomy, than by the &s;trength of their appetite. But the &s;weets of habit &s;upply all they have lo&s;t by &s;lavery. After being oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, the place of repo&s;e is full of delight. They &s;mell it at a di&s;tance, can di&s;tingui&s;h it in the mid&s;t of great cities, and &s;eem uniformly to pre|fer bondage to liberty. They form a &s;econd nature out of tho&s;e habits to which they have been forced to &s;ubmit; for hor&s;es, after being abandoned in the fore&s;ts, have been known to neigh continually, in order to be heard, to run to the voice of man, and even to grow meagre, and die in a &s;hort time, though &s;ur|rounded with a profu&s;ion of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Thus, it is obvious, the manners of a hor&s;e originate entirely from his education, which is accompli&s;hed by a care and indu&s;try be&s;towed by man upon no other animal; but he is amply rewarded by the perpetual &s;ervices of this noble and laborious creature.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="319"> The foals are &s;eparated from their mothers at the age of five, &s;ix, or at mo&s;t &s;even months; for experience &s;hows, that, when allowed to &s;uck ten or eleven months, though generally fatter and larger, they are not of equal value as tho&s;e which have been more early weaned. Af|ter &s;ix or &s;even months, the foals are removed from their mothers, and are fed twice a-day with bran and a little hay, the quantity of which is augmented in proportion as they advance in age. They are confined to the &s;tables as long as they di&s;cover any anxiety to return to their mo|thers. But when this inquietude is gone, they are allowed to go out, and are conducted to the pa&s;ture: They mu&s;t not, however, be permitted to graze when their &s;tomach is empty. An hour before being put to the gra&s;s, they &s;hould have a little bran, be made to drink, and &s;hould never be expo&s;ed to great colds or to rain. In this manner they pa&s;s the fir&s;t winter. In the month of May following, they may be allow|ed to pa&s;ture freely every day, and to remain out continually till the end of October, only ob|&s;erving not to permit them to eat the after|maths. If accu&s;tomed to feed upon this de|licate herbage, they will reject hay, which ought neverthele&s;s, together with bran, to be their principal food during the &s;econd winter. They are managed in the &s;ame manner, namely, al|lowing them to pa&s;ture in winter during the day, and in &s;ummer during both day and night, <PB N="315" REF="320"> till they arrive at the age of four years, when they are confined to dry food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may be the practice in France; but, in Britain, hor|&s;es, of all ages, are allowed to pa&s;ture freely in &s;ummer, without receiving any injury.</NOTE>. This change of nouri&s;hment requires &s;ome precautions. Du|ring the fir&s;t eight days, they &s;hould have only &s;traw; and a few vermifuge draughts may be given, to de&s;troy tho&s;e worms which may have been engendered by the bad dige&s;tion of crude herbs. M. de Gar&s;ault<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nouveau parfait Mar&eacute;chal, p. 84.</NOTE> recommends this prac|tice, the utility of which he had often experi|enced. It is, however, an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, that the &s;tomachs of hor&s;es, at all ages, and in all circum&s;tances, whether they feed upon gra&s;s, or upon oats and hay, are perpetually &s;tuffed with a prodigious multitude of worms<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion appears to be too general; for, in this coun|try, at lea&s;t, worms are by no means &s;o frequent.</NOTE>. The &s;to|mach of the a&s;s is always in the &s;ame condition; and yet none of the&s;e animals are incommoded by this &s;pecies of vermin. The&s;e worms, there|fore, ought not to be regarded as an accidental malady, occa&s;ioned by the indige&s;tion of crude herbs, but rather as an effect depending on the common food and ordinary dige&s;tion of the hor&s;e and a&s;s.</P>
<P>After young colts are weaned, they &s;hould not be put into too warm a &s;table, otherwi&s;e they will be rendered too delicate and too &s;en|&s;ible to the impre&s;&s;ions of the air. They &s;hould <PB N="316" REF="321"> be often &s;upplied with fre&s;h litter, and kept clean by frequent friction. But they ought neither to be tied nor handled till they are near three years of age. The manger and rack &s;hould not be too high; for the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tretching their neck and rai&s;ing their head, may induce a habit of keeping them in that po&s;ition, which would &s;poil their neck. When 12 or 18 months old, their tails &s;hould be cut; the hair will &s;hoot af|terwards, and become &s;tronger and thicker. At the age of two years, the male colts &s;hould be put with the hor&s;es, and the females with the mares. Without this precaution, the young males would fatigue and enervate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At the age of three years, or three and a half, we &s;hould begin to dre&s;s the colts, and to render them tractable. At fir&s;t, a light ea&s;y &s;addle &s;hould be placed on them, and allowed to remain two or three hours each day. They &s;hould like|wi&s;e be accu&s;tomed to receive a &s;naffle into their mouths, and to allow their feet to be lifted and &s;truck, in imitation of &s;hoeing. If de&s;tined for the coach or the draught, they ought to be har|ne&s;&s;ed as well as &s;naffled. A bridle is unnece&s;|&s;ary at fir&s;t: By means of a halter or cave&s;&s;on on their no&s;e, they may be made to trot up and down on a &s;mooth piece of ground, with only a &s;addle and harne&s;s on their bodies: And, when they turn ea&s;ily, and approach, without fear, the man who holds the <HI>longe</HI> or halter, they may then be mounted and di&s;mounted, without <PB N="317" REF="322"> making them walk, till they be four years old; for, before this period, a hor&s;e has not &s;trength enough to walk with a rider on his back. But, at four years, they may be mounted, and walk|ed or trotted at &s;mall intervals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Elemens de cavalerie de M. de la Gueriniere, tom. 1. p. 140.</NOTE>. When a coach|hor&s;e is accu&s;tomed to the harne&s;s, he may be yoked with a bred hor&s;e, and guided with a <HI>longe</HI> or halter pa&s;&s;ed through the bridle, till he begins to know his duty. The coachman may next try to make him draw, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a man to pu&s;h him gently behind, and even to give him &s;ome &s;light la&s;hes. All this education &s;hould be gone through, before the young hor&s;es have their diet changed; for, after being fed with grain or &s;traw, they are more vigorous, and con|&s;equently le&s;s docile, and more difficult to<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le nouveau parfait Mar&eacute;chal, par M. de Garfault, p. 86.</NOTE> break<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">By this management, it is admitted, that hor&s;es may be ea|&s;ier broke.

<P>The bit and the &s;pur have been contrived to command the obedience of hor&s;es; the bit for the direction, and the &s;pur for the quickne&s;s of their movements. Nature &s;eems to have de&s;tined the mouth &s;olely for receiving the impre&s;&s;ions of ta&s;te and of appetite. But the mouth of the <PB N="318" REF="323"> hor&s;e is endowed with &s;uch an amazing &s;en&s;ibili|ty, that, to this organ, in place of the eye and ear, man applies for conveying the indications of his will to this animal. The &s;lighte&s;t motion or pre&s;|&s;ure of the bit gives him notice, and determines his cour&s;e. This organ of &s;en&s;ation has no fault but that of perfection; its too great &s;en&s;ibility requires the mo&s;t dexterous management; for the &s;malle&s;t abu&s;e &s;poils the mouth, by render|ing it in&s;en&s;ible to the impre&s;&s;ions of the bit. The &s;en&s;es of &s;eeing and hearing cannot be blunted in this manner: But it is probable, that all attempts to govern hor&s;es by the&s;e organs have been found inconvenient. Be&s;ides, the &s;igns tran&s;mitted by the touch have a &s;tronger effect upon animals in general, than tho&s;e conveyed by the eye or ear. The &s;ituation of a hor&s;e's eyes, with regard to his rider or conductor, is extremely unfavourable: And, though they be often animated and conducted by the ear, it ap|pears that the u&s;e of this organ is abandoned to the coar&s;er &s;pecies of hor&s;es; for, in the menage, they are &s;eldom addre&s;&s;ed by the ear. In a word, when hor&s;es are well educated, the &s;mall|est pre&s;&s;ure of the thighs, the &s;lighte&s;t movement of the bit, are &s;ufficient to direct them. Even the &s;pur is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, being &s;eldom employed but to force them to exert violent motions: And when, from the ignorance of the hor&s;eman, he gives the &s;pur, and at the &s;ame time retracts the bridle, the hor&s;e, finding him&s;elf incited on <PB N="319" REF="324"> one &s;ide and re&s;trained on the other, is obliged to rear, or make a perpendicular bound.</P>
<P>By means of the bridle, the hor&s;e is taught to keep his head in the mo&s;t beautiful and advan|tageous &s;ituation, and the &s;malle&s;t &s;ign or &s;light|e&s;t movement of the rider is &s;ufficient to make the animal a&s;&s;ume its different paces. The trot is perhaps the mo&s;t natural motion of a hor&s;e; but the pace, and even the gallop, are mo&s;t ea&s;y to the rider; and the&s;e are the two motions which are mo&s;t in reque&s;t. When a hor&s;e lifts his fore|leg in order to walk, this movement mu&s;t be made with &s;teadine&s;s and facility, and the knee mu&s;t likewi&s;e be bended. The lifted leg mu&s;t appear, for a moment, to be &s;upported, and when let down, it mu&s;t be firm, and equally &s;upported on the ground, before the head receive any impre&s;&s;ion from this movement; for, when the leg falls &s;uddenly down, and the head &s;inks at the &s;ame time, this motion is generally made to give a &s;peedy relief to the other leg, which is not &s;trong enough alone to &s;upport the whole weight of the body. This is a very great defect in a hor&s;e. It is al&s;o worthy of remark, that, when he re&s;ts on his heels, it is a &s;ign of weakne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only &s;ure mark of &s;trength and &s;oundne&s;s in a hor&s;e, is when he re&s;ts firmly upon his foot, without favouring any par|ticular part of it.</NOTE>; and when he &s;upports him&s;elf on his toes, it is an unnatural and fatiguing attitude, which the hor&s;e cannot long continue.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325"> Walking, though the &s;lowe&s;t of all motions, ought to be bri&s;k, light, and neither too long nor too &s;hort.

<P><PB N="323" REF="329"> But lightne&s;s is not the only good quality in the movements of the hor&s;e: They &s;hould like|wi&s;e be equal and uniform both before and be|hind: For, if the crupper vibrates when the &s;houlders are &s;upported, his motion will be jolt|ing and incommodious to the rider. The &s;ame thing happens, when the hor&s;e lengthens &s;o much the &s;tep of the hind-leg, that the foot lights beyond the print of the fore-foot. Hor&s;es with &s;hort bodies are &s;ubject to this fault. Tho&s;e who&s;e legs cro&s;s each other, or hew, have an un&s;teady motion; and, in general, long-bodied hor&s;es are mo&s;t commodious to the rider, becau&s;e he is placed at a greater di&s;tance from the two centres of motion, the &s;houlders and haunches, and is of cour&s;e le&s;s jolted.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="330"> The general mode of walking among quadru|peds is to lift, at one time, a fore-leg and a hind-leg of oppo&s;ite &s;ides. As their bodies re&s;t on four points which form an oblong &s;quare, the mo&s;t commodious manner of moving is to change two at a time in the diagonal; &s;o that the centre of gravity of the animal's body may always remain nearly in the direction of the two points of &s;up|port which are not in motion. In the three na|tural movements of the hor&s;e, namely, the walk, the trot, and the gallop, this mode is always ob|&s;erved, though with &s;ome variations. In walking there are four beats or times of moving: If the right fore-leg moves fir&s;t, the left hind-leg in&s;tant|ly follows; then the left fore-leg moves, and is in&s;tantly followed by the right hind-leg. Thus the right fore-foot re&s;ts fir&s;t on the ground, then the left hind-foot, next the left fore-foot, and, la&s;tly, the right hind-foot, which makes a mo|tion con&s;i&s;ting of four beats and three intervals, of which the fir&s;t and third are &s;horter than the middle one. In the trot, there are only two beats: If the right fore-leg parts from the ground, it is accompanied, at the &s;ame time, by the left hind-leg; then the left fore-leg moves at the &s;ame time with the right hind-leg; &s;o that, in this motion, there are but two beats and one interval; the right fore-leg and the left hind-leg re&s;ts on the ground at the &s;ame time, and the &s;ame thing happens with regard to the left fore-leg and the right hind-leg. In the gallop, <PB N="325" REF="331"> there are commonly three beats: The left hind-|leg moves fir&s;t and re&s;ts fir&s;t on the ground; then the right hind-leg is rai&s;ed along with the left fore-leg, and both re&s;t on the ground at the &s;ame time; and, la&s;tly, the right fore-leg is rai&s;ed in&s;tantly after the left fore-leg and the right hind-leg, and falls la&s;t upon the ground. Thus in the gallop, there are three beats and two intervals: In the fir&s;t interval, when the motion is quick, the four legs, for an in&s;tant, are in the air at the &s;ame time, and the four &s;hoes appear at once. When the hor&s;e has &s;upple limbs and haunches, and moves with agi|lity, the gallop is mo&s;t perfect, and the feet fall at four times, fir&s;t, the left hind-leg, then the right hind-leg, next the left fore-leg, and, la&s;tly, the right fore-leg.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es generally gallop upon the right foot, in the &s;ame manner as they &s;et out in walking or trotting, with the right fore-leg. In gallop|ing, they fir&s;t cut the road with the right fore-|leg, which is farther advanced than the left; and the right hind-leg, which immediately follows the right fore-leg, is likewi&s;e farther advanced than the left hind-leg. Hence the left leg, which bears the whole weight, and pu&s;hes the others forward, has the greate&s;t fatigue; &s;o that it would be proper to learn hor&s;es to gallop al|ternately upon the left and right legs; becau&s;e it would enable them to continue this violent motion much longer. This is practi&s;ed at the <PB N="326" REF="332"> menage, but perhaps for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e, in galloping round a circle, the centre of which is &s;ometimes on the right, and &s;ome|times on the left, the rider is frequently obliged to change his hand.</P>
<P>In walking, the hor&s;e rai&s;es his feet very little above the &s;urface; in trotting, he elevates them a little more, and, in galloping, &s;till higher. The walk ought to be &s;mart, light, and &s;ure; the trot &s;hould be firm, quick, and equally &s;up|ported, and the fore-legs pu&s;hed with rapidity by the hind ones. The trotting hor&s;e &s;hould carry his head pretty high, and keep his body &s;traight; for, if the haunches ri&s;e and fall alternately at every movement, and if the crupper rocks, the animal is too weak for this motion. To throw the fore-legs out, is another fault: They ought always to be on the &s;ame line with tho&s;e behind, and to efface their prints<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the author differs from all our expert hor&s;emen, who uniformly prefer tho&s;e hor&s;es which go wider behind than be|fore; becau&s;e hor&s;es of this kind are not &s;o apt to cut their legs, are more agile in their movements, and can &s;upport greater fa|tigue in long journies, &amp;c.</NOTE>. When one of the hind-legs moves, and if the fore-leg on the &s;ame &s;ide re&s;ts too long, the movement becomes hard by this re&s;i&s;tance. It is for this rea&s;on, that the interval between the two beats of the trot ought to be &s;hort: But, however &s;hort it may be, this re&s;i&s;tance is &s;ufficient to make the trot harder than the walk or gallop.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="333"> The &s;pring of the hocks contributes as much to the motions of galloping as that of the loins. While the latter make an effort to elevate and pu&s;h forward the anterior parts, the &s;pring of the hocks breaks the &s;troke and &s;oftens the &s;hock. Hence the more uniform and &s;trong the &s;pring of the hocks, the gallop is &s;ofter and more rapid.</P>
<P>Though walking, trotting, and galloping be the natural and ordinary movements of hor&s;es, yet &s;ome of them have another natural motion, known by the name of <HI>ambling,</HI> or <HI>pacing</HI>; which is very different from the other three; and, though le&s;s quick than the hard trot or gallop, it appears, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be extremely fati|guing to the animal. The foot of the hor&s;e, in this movement, grazes the &s;urface &s;till nearer than in walking, and each &s;tep is much longer. But, what is &s;ingular, to make a pace, the two legs of the &s;ame &s;ide part from the ground at the &s;ame time, the fore and hind leg, for ex|ample, of the right &s;ide, and then the two legs of the left &s;ide; &s;o that each &s;ide of the body alternately want &s;upport, which mu&s;t greatly fa|tigue the animal, who is obliged to &s;upport a balance forced by the rapidity of a movement which is hardly elevated above the ground; for nothing but the rapidity of the motion, and the &s;mallne&s;s of the elevation, could po&s;&s;ibly prevent the creature from falling on his &s;ide. In the motion of pacing, as in that of trotting, there are <PB N="328" REF="334"> only two beats. This movement, which is very laborious to the hor&s;e, and in which he ought not to be indulged excepting on &s;mooth ground, is very ea&s;y to the rider; it has not the hardne&s;s of the trot, becau&s;e the hind leg moves along with the fore one, and creates no re&s;i&s;tance to the motion. We are told by connoi&s;&s;eurs, that hor&s;es which naturally amble, never trot, and that they are much weaker than tho&s;e that have no &s;uch movement. Colts, indeed, often a&s;&s;ume this mode of moving, when forced to go quick, and when they have not &s;trength enough to trot or to gallop; and even good hor&s;es, after being fa|tigued, or when they begin to decay, are apt, when pu&s;hed, to amble &s;pontaneou&s;ly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'Ecole de cavalerie de M. de la Gueriniere, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The amble may therefore be regarded as a mo|tion occa&s;ioned by weakne&s;s or defect. But there are two other movements a&s;&s;umed &s;pontaneou&s;ly by weak or decayed hor&s;es, which are &s;till more defective than that of the amble, and are known by the name of <HI>Broken ambles.</HI> The one is a motion between walking and ambling, and the other between trotting and galloping. Both proceed from great fatigue, or weakne&s;s in the loins, and are con&s;picuous in many of our hack|ney and po&s;t-hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupeds, the hor&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, along with grandeur of &s;tature, the greate&s;t elegance and proportion of part. By comparing him with the animals immediately above or below <PB N="329" REF="335"> him, we find that the a&s;s is ill made; that the head of the lion is too large; that the limbs of the ox are too &s;lender and too &s;hort, in propor|tion to the &s;ize of his body; that the camel is deformed; and that the gro&s;&s;er animals, as the rhinoceros and elephant, may be con&s;idered as rude and &s;hapele&s;s ma&s;&s;es. The great difference between the head of man and that of the qua|drupeds, con&s;i&s;ts in the length of their jaws, which is the mo&s;t ignoble of all characters. But, though the jaws of the hor&s;e be very long, he has not, like the a&s;s, an air of imbecility, nor, like the ox, of &s;tupidity. The regularity and proportion of the parts of his head give him a light and &s;prightly a&s;pect, which is well &s;up|ported by the beauty of his che&s;t. He elevates his head, as if anxious to exalt him&s;elf above the condition of quadrupeds. In this noble attitude, he regards man face to face. His eyes are open and lively, his ears hand&s;ome and of a proper height, being neither too long, like tho&s;e of the a&s;s, nor too &s;hort, like tho&s;e of the bull. His mane adorns his neck, and gives him the ap|pearance of &s;trength and of courage. His long bu&s;hy tail covers and terminates with advantage the extremity of his body. His tail, very different from the &s;hort tails of the deer, ele|phant, &amp;c. and from the naked tails of the a&s;s, camel, rhinoceros, &amp;c. is formed of long thick hairs which &s;eem to ari&s;e from his crupper, becau&s;e the trunk from which they proceed is very &s;hort. <PB N="330" REF="336"> He cannot, like the lion, elevate his tail, but, though pendulous, it becomes him better: And, as he can move it from &s;ide to &s;ide, it &s;erves him to drive off the flies which incommode him; for, though his &s;kin be very firm, and well gar|ni&s;hed with clo&s;e hair, it fails not to be extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>The attitude of the head and neck contributes more than all the other parts of his body, to give him a graceful a&s;pect. The &s;uperior part of the neck from which the mane i&s;&s;ues, &s;hould fir&s;t ri&s;e in a &s;traight line from the withers, and then, as it approaches the head, form a curve nearly &s;imilar to that of a &s;wan's neck. The inferior part of the neck &s;hould have no curva|ture, but ri&s;e in a &s;traight line from the poitrel, or brea&s;t, to the under jaw, with a &s;mall inclina|tion forward. If it ro&s;e in a perpendicular direc|tion, its &s;ymmetry and gracefulne&s;s would be di|mini&s;hed. The &s;uperior part of the neck &s;hould be thin, with little fle&s;h near the mane, which ought to be garni&s;hed with long delicate hair. A fine neck &s;hould be long and elevated, but propor|tioned to the general &s;ize of the animal. When too long, the hor&s;e commonly throws back his head; and, when too &s;hort and fle&s;hy, the head is heavy to the hand. The mo&s;t advan|tageous po&s;ition of the head is, when the front is perpendicular to the horizon.</P>
<P>The head of a hor&s;e &s;hould be thin and mea|gre, and not too long. The ears &s;hould be <PB N="331" REF="337"> &s;mall, erect, but not too &s;tiff, narrow, and placed on the upper part of the head, at a proper di&s;tance from each other. The front &s;hould be narrow and a little convex, the eye-pits, or &s;paces between the eyes and ears, well filled, and the eye-lids thin; the eyes &s;hould be pretty large and prominent, clear, lively, and full of fire; the pupil &s;hould be ra|ther large, the under jaw a little thick, but not fle&s;hy, the no&s;e &s;omewhat arched, the no&s;trils open and deep, and divided by a thin &s;eptum or partition. The mouth &s;hould be delicate and moderately &s;plit, lips thin, the withers &s;harp and elevated, the &s;houlders flat, and not confined; the back equal, a little arched lengthways, and rai&s;ed on each &s;ide of the back-bone, which ought to have the appearance of being &s;unk; the flanks &s;hould be &s;hort and full, the crupper round and plump, the haunches well furni&s;hed with mu&s;cular fle&s;h, the dock or fle&s;hy part of the tail firm and thick, the thighs large and fle&s;hy, the hock round before, broad on the &s;ides, and tendinous behind; the &s;hank thin be|fore, and broad on the &s;ides; the tendon, (or tendo Achillis) prominent, &s;trong, and well de|tached from the leg-bone, and the fetlock &s;ome|what prominent, and garni&s;hed with a &s;mall tuft of long hair behind; the pa&s;terns &s;hould be of a middling length, and pretty large; the coronet a little elevated, the hoof black, &s;olid, and &s;hining, the in&s;tep high, the quarters round, the heels broad, and a little prominent, <PB N="332" REF="338"> the frog thin and &s;mall, and the &s;ole thick and concave.</P>
<P>Few hor&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;s all the&s;e perfections. The eyes are &s;ubject to many faults, which it is often difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h. In a &s;ound eye, two or three &s;oot-coloured &s;pots appear through the cornea above the pupil; for, unle&s;s the cornea be clean and tran&s;parent, the&s;e &s;pots cannot be &s;een. When the pupil is &s;mall, long, and nar|row, or &s;urrounded with a white circle, or when it is of a greeni&s;h blue colour, the eye is unque|&s;tionably bad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many other marks of bad eyes; but, as their colour depends much on the light in which they are viewed, little information can be derived from it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Without entering into a long detail, the fol|lowing general remarks will enable the reader to form a judgment of the principal perfections and imperfections of a hor&s;e. The motion of the ears affords a tolerable criterion: When a hor&s;e walks, the point of his ears &s;hould incline forwards; when fatigued, his ears hang down; and, when angry, or of a malignant di&s;po&s;ition, he points alternately one of his ears forwards, and another backwards. Every hor&s;e turns his ears to that &s;ide from which he hears any noi&s;e; and, when &s;truck on the back or on the crup|per, he turns his ears backward. Hor&s;es with hollow eyes, or with one eye &s;maller than the o|ther, have generally a bad &s;ight. Tho&s;e who&s;e mouths are dry, have not &s;uch good con&s;titutions <PB N="333" REF="339"> as tho&s;e that have moi&s;t mouths, and foam with the bit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A dry or wet mouth is a con&s;equence of the particular &s;tate of the body at the time; and, therefore, can be no indica|tion of the general con&s;titution or &s;trength of a hor&s;e.</NOTE>. The &s;houlders of a &s;addle-hor&s;e &s;hould be flat, &s;upple, and not too fle&s;hy. A draught-hor&s;e, on the contrary, ought to have thick, round, fle&s;hy &s;houlders. If, however, the &s;houlders of a &s;addle-hor&s;e be too meagre, and the bones advance too much through the &s;kin, it is an indication that his &s;houlders are not free, and that, of cour&s;e, he will be unable to under|go much fatigue. Another defect of a &s;addle-hor&s;e is to have the poitrel, or brea&s;t, too pro|minent, and the fore-legs inclined or placed too far backward; becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, he is &s;ubject to lean heavy upon the hand in galloping, and e|ven to &s;tumble and fall. The length of the legs &s;hould be proportioned to the &s;tature of the hor&s;e. When the fore-legs are too long, he is not &s;teady on his feet; and, when too &s;hort, he bears heavy on the hand. It has been remark|ed, that mares are more liable than hor&s;es to be low before, and that &s;tone-hor&s;es have thick|er necks than mares or geldings.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to know the age of a hor&s;e. The eye-pits of old hor&s;es are commonly hollow: But this mark is equivocal; for young hor&s;es begot by old &s;tallions have likewi&s;e hol|low eye-pits. The teeth afford the be&s;t criterion of the age of hor&s;es. The hor&s;e has, in all, 40 teeth, viz. 24 grinders, 4 canine, or tu&s;hes, and <PB N="334" REF="340"> 12 fore-teeth. Mares have either no dog-teeth, or very &s;hort ones. The canine and fore-teeth on|ly afford indications of the age. Five days af|ter birth, the fore-teeth begin to &s;hoot. The&s;e fir&s;t teeth are round, &s;hort, and not very &s;olid; and they fall out, at different times, to be repla|ced by others. At two years and a half, the four middle fore-teeth fall out, two above and two below. The next year, other four are &s;hed, one on each &s;ide of the fir&s;t, which are now re|placed. At four years and a half, other four fall out, always on each &s;ide of tho&s;e that were for|merly &s;hed and replaced. The&s;e la&s;t four foal-teeth are &s;ucceeded by other four, which grow not near &s;o quickly as the fir&s;t eight. It is from the&s;e four, called corner teeth, that the age of a hor&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed; and they are ea&s;ily known, being always the third, both a|bove and below, reckoning from the middle to the extremity of the jaw. They are hol|low, and have a black mark in their ca|vities. At four and a half, or five years, the&s;e teeth hardly ri&s;e above the gums, and their ca|vities are very perceptible. At &s;ix years and a half, the cavities begin to fill up, and the mark gradually dimini&s;hes till the animal is &s;even and a half, or eight years, when the cavities are per|fectly filled, and the mark totally effaced. Af|ter this period, the age is attempted to be di&s;co|vered by the tu&s;hes or canine teeth. The&s;e four teeth lie immediately adjacent to the other four <PB N="335" REF="341"> above de&s;cribed. Neither the tu&s;hes nor grinders &s;hed. At the age of three years and a half, the two tu&s;hes of the under jaw generally begin to &s;hoot; the two of the upper jaw appear at the age of four, and, till &s;ix years be completed, they are very &s;harp. At ten years, the tu&s;hes of the upper jaw &s;eem to be blunted, worn out, and long, becau&s;e the gums retract with age; and the more this appearance takes place, the older is the hor&s;e. From ten to thirteen or fourteen years, there are hardly any marks by which the age may be di&s;covered. Some hairs of the eye-brows, indeed, begin to grow white; but this mark is equally equivocal as that derived from the depth of the eye-pits; for, it has been remarked, that hor&s;es begot by old &s;tallions and old mares, have white hairs in the eye-brows at the age of nine or ten. The teeth of &s;ome hor&s;es are &s;o hard, that they wear not by eating, and never lo&s;e the black mark. But the&s;e hor|&s;es are ea&s;ily known, becau&s;e the cavities of their teeth are perfectly filled up, and their tu&s;hes are very long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'Ecole de cavalerie de M. de la Gueriniere, p. 25.</NOTE>. The age of a hor&s;e may likewi&s;e be known, though with le&s;s preci&s;ion, by the bars or ridges of the palate, which are effaced in proportion as he advances in years.</P>
<P>At the age of two years, or two and a half, the hor&s;e is in a condition to propagate; and the mares, like mo&s;t other females, are &s;till &s;ooner ripe for this operation. But the foals produced from &s;uch early embraces, are weakly, <PB N="336" REF="342"> or ill-formed. The hor&s;e &s;hould never be ad|mitted to the mare till he is four or four and a half; and even this period is too early, except|ing for coar&s;e or draught-hor&s;es. When fine hor&s;es are wanted, the male &s;hould not be ad|mitted to the mare before he is &s;ix years old; and Spani&s;h &s;tallions not till they be full &s;even. The mares may be one year younger: They generally come in &s;ea&s;on from the end of March to the end of June. But their chief ardour for the hor&s;e la&s;ts not above 15 days or three weeks; and, during this critical period, the mare &s;hould be admitted to the &s;tallion: He ought to be &s;ound, vigorous, well-made, and of a good breed. To procure fine &s;addle-hor&s;es, foreign &s;tallions, as Arabians, Turks, Barbs, and Andalou&s;ians, are preferable to all others. Next to the&s;e, Briti&s;h &s;tallions are the be&s;t; becau&s;e they originally &s;prung from tho&s;e above mentioned, and are very little degenerated. Italian &s;tallions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Naples, are extremely good. With mares of a proper &s;ize, they produce excellent hor&s;es for the &s;addle; and, with &s;trong large mares, they produce good coach-hor&s;es. It is alledged, that, in France, Britain, &amp;c. the Arabian and Barbary &s;tallions generally beget hor&s;es larger than them&s;elves; and that tho&s;e of Spain, on the contrary, produce a breed more diminutive. The be&s;t &s;tallions for coach-hor&s;es are tho&s;e of Naples, Denmark, Hol&s;tein, and Frie&s;land. The &s;tallions for &s;addle-hor&s;es &s;hould be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fourteen hands and a half.</NOTE> four feet <PB N="337" REF="343"> eight or ten inches, and five feet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fifteen hands.</NOTE>, at lea&s;t, for coach-hor&s;es. Neither ought the colour of &s;tal|lions to be overlooked, as a fine black, gray, bay, &s;orrel, &amp;c. All party-coloured, or ill defined colours, ought to be bani&s;hed from the &s;tud, as well as every hor&s;e which has white extremities. Be&s;ides the&s;e external qualities, a &s;tallion &s;hould be endowed with courage, tractability, and &s;pi|rit; he &s;hould have agility, a &s;en&s;ible mouth, and &s;ure limbs; his &s;houlders &s;hould be perfectly free, and his haunches &s;upple; he &s;hould have a &s;pring and ela&s;ticity in his whole body, e&s;pecial|ly in his hind legs; and he ought to be trained and dre&s;&s;ed in the riding-&s;chool. The&s;e precautions in the choice of a &s;tallion are the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it has been found by experience, that he communicates to his offspring almo&s;t all his good or bad qualities, whether natural or acquired. A hor&s;e naturally cro&s;s, &s;kitti&s;h, re&s;tive, &amp;c. pro|duces foals of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions: And, as the defects of conformation and the vices of the humours are more certainly perpetuated than the qualities of the temper, one &s;hould reject from the &s;tud every hor&s;e that is deformed or di&s;ea&s;ed, extremely vicious, glandered, broken-winded, frantic, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In our climate, the mare contributes le&s;s to the beauty of her offspring than the &s;tallion; but &s;he contributes more, perhaps, to their &s;tature and con&s;titution. It is, therefore, of great im|portance, <PB N="338" REF="344"> that mares for breed &s;hould be &s;ound, tall, large, and roomy in the trunk of the body, and good nur&s;es. For elegant hor&s;es, Spani&s;h and Italian mares are be&s;t; but, for draught|hor&s;es, tho&s;e of Britain and Normandy are pre|ferable. However, when the &s;tallions are good, fine hor&s;es may be produced from mares of any country, provided they be well made and of a good breed; for, if the mares have &s;prung from a bad &s;tallion, their offspring are generally de|fective. In hor&s;es, as in the human &s;pecies, the young very frequently re&s;emble either their male or female predece&s;&s;ors; only, it would appear, that, among the hor&s;e-kind, the female contri|butes le&s;s to the work of generation than in the human &s;pecies. The &s;on more frequently re|&s;embles his mother than the foal does the mare from which he is produced; and, when the foal happens to re&s;emble his mother, the likene&s;s is generally confined to the anterior parts of the body, as the head and neck.</P>
<P>To judge of the re&s;emblance of children to their parents, the compari&s;on ought not to be made till after the age of puberty. For, at this period, &s;o many changes take place, that a per|&s;on, with whom we were formerly familiar, we will hardly, at fir&s;t &s;ight, be able to di&s;tingui&s;h. In the human &s;pecies, the &s;on, after puberty, of|ten re&s;embles the father, and the daughter the mother, and, not unfrequently, each retains a partial likene&s;s to both parents; and this family-likene&s;s <PB N="339" REF="345"> is generally recogni&s;able in uncles, aunts, and in every a&s;cending or de&s;cending branch. Among hor&s;es, as the male contributes more to the offspring than the female, mares very fre|quently produce foals which have a great re|&s;emblance to the &s;tallion, or which always re|&s;emble the father more than the mother. And, even when the mare has been begot by a bad hor&s;e, it often happens, that, though &s;erved by a good &s;tallion, and though hand&s;ome her&s;elf, her offspring, though beautiful and well made at fir&s;t, gradually decline as they grow up; and other mares, &s;prung from a good race, produce foals, which, though they have an unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect when young, improve as they advance in years.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, though they &s;eem to concur in proving that the males have greater influence on the offspring than the females, appear not to be &s;ufficient to render this point altogether unque|&s;tionable. It is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;tal|lions, which are always &s;elected from a great number, generally imported from a warm cli|mate, and fed and managed with the greate&s;t care and circum&s;pection, &s;hould prevail, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of generation, over common mares, bred in a cold country, and often &s;ubjected to hard labour. If mares were &s;elected from warm climates, managed with equal attention, and &s;er|ved with the common &s;tallions of our own coun|try, I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, that, in this <PB N="340" REF="346"> ca&s;e, the &s;uperiority of the females would be equally apparent as that of the males; and, in general, that, among hor&s;es, as well as the hu|man &s;pecies, the influence of both parents, when placed in equal circum&s;tances, is nearly the &s;ame. What renders this opinion both more natural and more probable, is the well known fact, that, in &s;tuds, the number of females produced is e|qual to that of the males; which is a clear proof, that, with regard to &s;ex at lea&s;t, the female contributes her full proportion.</P>
<P>But, to return to our &s;ubject. When the &s;tal|lion is cho&s;en, and the mares are a&s;&s;embled, an|other &s;tone-hor&s;e &s;hould be allowed to teaze them, for no other purpo&s;e but to di&s;cover tho&s;e which are in &s;ea&s;on. Tho&s;e that are not in proper condition repel his attacks. But, in&s;tead of al|lowing him to proceed with the mares which are in &s;ea&s;on, he is led off, and the true &s;tallion is &s;ub&s;tituted in his place. This trial is chiefly u&s;eful for di&s;covering the condition of &s;uch mares as have never produced; for tho&s;e which have produced are commonly in &s;ea&s;on nine days af|ter their delivery, and may be &s;afely covered on the tenth day. Nine days after, their condition may be tried by the above proof, and, if &s;till in &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hould be covered a &s;econd time, and &s;o on every ninth day, till their ardour a|bates, which happens a few days after concep|tion. But, to conduct this matter properly, requires con&s;iderable attention and expence. The <PB N="341" REF="347"> &s;tud &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed on good ground, and its dimen&s;ions proportioned to the quantity of mares and &s;tallions employed. This ground &s;hould be divided into &s;everal apartments, and well fenced with ditches or hedges. The impreg|nated mares, and tho&s;e which are &s;uckling their young, &s;hould have the riche&s;t pa&s;ture. Another enclo&s;ure, where the gra&s;s is le&s;s rich, &s;hould contain the uncovered mares, tho&s;e that have not conceived, and the female foals; for a rich pa&s;ture makes them grow too fat, and weakens the generative faculty. La&s;tly, the young male foals and geldings &s;hould be confined to the drie&s;t and mo&s;t unequal part of the ground, that, by a&s;cending and de&s;cending the eminences, they may acquire a freedom in their limbs and &s;houlders. This la&s;t enclo&s;ure &s;hould be well fenced from that which contains the mares, to prevent the young hor&s;es from enervating them|&s;elves by premature efforts. If the field be &s;uf|ficiently exten&s;ive, each of the&s;e enclo&s;ures &s;hould be divided into two, and grazed alter|nately by hor&s;es and oxen. This mode of gra|zing improves the pa&s;ture; for the ox repairs what is injured by the hor&s;e. Each park &s;hould likewi&s;e be furni&s;hed with a pond, which is bet|ter than a running water, and al&s;o with trees to &s;helter the animals from too much heat; but, to prevent accidents, all old &s;tumps &s;hould be root|ed out, and deep holes filled up. The&s;e pa&s;tures will afford &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment to the &s;tud du|ring <PB N="342" REF="348"> the &s;ummer; but, in winter, the mares and foals &s;hould be put into &s;tables, and fed with hay, excepting in very fine weather, when they may be &s;et out to pa&s;ture during the day. The &s;tal|lions &s;hould be always kept in the &s;tables, fed with a greater proportion of &s;traw than of hay, and moderately exerci&s;ed till the time of cover|ing, which generally la&s;ts from the beginning of April till the end of June. During this pe|riod, they &s;hould be fed plentifully, but with nothing more than their ordinary food.</P>
<P>When the &s;tallion is conducted to the mare, to augment his ardour, he &s;hould be well dre&s;&s;ed. The mare &s;hould have the &s;hoes taken off her hind feet; for &s;ome of them are apt to kick at the approach of the &s;tallion. One man holds the mare by the head, and two others lead the &s;tal|lion by long reins. When in a proper &s;itua|tion, he &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the hand, and by turning a&s;ide the tail of the mare; for the op|po&s;ition of a &s;ingle hair might wound him in a dangerous manner. The &s;tallion &s;ometimes quits the mare without con&s;ummating. If the trunk of his tail near the crupper vibrates before he de&s;cends, we may be certain that he has con&s;um|mated; for this motion always accompanies e|mi&s;&s;ion. After con&s;ummation, the act &s;hould not be reiterated; but he ought to be carried back immediately to the &s;table, there to remain two days: For, though a hor&s;e might be able to cover every day during the &s;ea&s;on; yet, if only <PB N="343" REF="349"> admitted once in two days, he is both more vi|gorous and more &s;ucce&s;sful. During the fir&s;t &s;even days, therefore, let him have four differ|ent mares, and, on the ninth, let him again co|ver the fir&s;t mare, and &s;o on as long as they continue in &s;ea&s;on. When one of the mares cea&s;es to be ardent, another &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in her place; and, as many are impregnated at the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third time, a &s;tallion, mana|ged in this manner, may cover 15 or 18 mares, and produce 10 or 12 foals, during the three months that the&s;e amours continue. Stallions throw out a va&s;t profu&s;ion of &s;eminal fluid; mares likewi&s;e emit, or rather di&s;till, a fluid du|ring the time they are in &s;ea&s;on; and, as &s;oon as they are pregnant, the&s;e emi&s;&s;ions cea&s;e. This fluid was called <HI>Hippomanes</HI> by the Greeks; and of it they are &s;aid to have made love-po|tions, which rendered hor&s;es, in particular, fran|tic with de&s;ire. The Hippomanes in totally different from the fluid found in the membranes that cover the foal, which was fir&s;t di&s;covered and de&s;cribed by M. Daubenton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l' acad. des &s;ciences, ann&eacute;e 1751.</NOTE>. The ap|pearance of the hippomanes is the mo&s;t certain mark of ardour in mares. This pa&s;&s;ion may like|wi&s;e be di&s;covered by the &s;welling of the under part of the vulva, and by the frequent neighing of the mares, who, at this period, have a &s;trong de&s;ire of approaching the hor&s;e. After a mare has been covered, &s;he may be led to the pa&s;ture <PB N="344" REF="350"> without any other precaution. The fir&s;t foal is always more puny than the &s;ub&s;equent ones: To compen&s;ate this defect, a mare &s;hould be &s;erved, for the fir&s;t time, with a large &s;tallion. The differences in the figures of the hor&s;e and mare &s;hould be attended to, in order to correct the faults of the one by the perfections of the other; and no di&s;proportioned conjunctions ought to be admitted, as of a &s;mall hor&s;e and a large mare, or of a large hor&s;e and a &s;mall mare; for the produce of &s;uch conjunctions will either be &s;mall or ill-proportioned. In order to improve nature, we mu&s;t advance by gradual &s;teps: A plump, but hand&s;ome hor&s;e, for example, may be admitted to a mare that is too gro&s;s, a &s;mall mare to a hor&s;e a little taller, a mare with a bad fore-hand to a hor&s;e with a fine head, neck, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that &s;tuds kept in dry light &s;oils produce active, nimble, and vigorous hor&s;es, with nervous limbs and &s;trong hoofs; while tho&s;e kept in moi&s;t ground, and in too rich pa&s;turage, have generally large heavy heads, gro&s;s bodies, thick legs, bad hoofs, and broad feet. It is ea&s;y to perceive that the&s;e differences proceed from the varieties in climate and food. But the nece&s;&s;ity of cro&s;&s;ing the breed, to pre|vent the degeneration of hor&s;es, is more difficult to under&s;tand, and of more importance to be known.</P>
<P>There is in Nature a general prototype of e|very &s;pecies, upon which each individual is mo|delled, <PB N="345" REF="351"> but which &s;eems, in its actual production, to be depraved or improved by circum&s;tances; &s;o that, with regard to certain qualities, there appears to be an unaccountable variation in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of individuals, and, at the &s;ame time, an admirable uniformity in the entire &s;pecies. The fir&s;t animal, the fir&s;t hor&s;e, for example, has been the external and internal model, upon which all the hor&s;es that have exi&s;ted, or &s;hall exi&s;t, have been formed. But this model, of which we know only copies, has had, in com|municating and multiplying its form, the power of adulterating or of improving it&s;elf. The o|riginal impre&s;&s;ion is pre&s;erved in each individual. But, among millions of individuals, not one ex|actly re&s;embles another, nor, of cour&s;e, the mo|del from which they &s;prung. This difference, which &s;hows that Nature is not ab&s;olute, but knows how to vary her works by infinite &s;hades, is equally con&s;picuous in the human &s;pecies, in all animals, and in all vegetables. What is &s;in|gular, this model of the beautiful and the excel|lent, &s;eems to be di&s;per&s;ed over every region of the earth, a portion of which re&s;ides in all cli|mates, and always degenerates, unle&s;s united with another portion brought from a di&s;tance. In order, therefore, to obtain good grain, beau|tiful flowers, &amp;c. the &s;eeds mu&s;t be changed, and never &s;own in the &s;ame &s;oil that produced them. In the &s;ame manner, to have fine hor&s;es, dogs, &amp;c. the males and females of different <PB N="346" REF="352"> countries mu&s;t have reciprocal intercour&s;e. Without this precaution, all grain, flowers, and animals degenerate, or rather receive an impre&s;|&s;ion from the climate &s;o &s;trong as to deform and adulterate the &s;pecies. This impre&s;&s;ion remains; but it is disfigured by every feature that is not e&s;&s;ential. By mixing races, on the contrary, or by cro&s;&s;ing the breed of different climates, beau|ty of form, and every other u&s;eful quality, are brought to perfection; Nature recovers her &s;pring, and exhibits her be&s;t productions.</P>
<P>I mean not to enter into a detail of the cau&s;es of the&s;e effects; but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch conjectures as mo&s;t readily pre&s;ent them&s;elves. We know by experience, that animals or vege|tables, tran&s;ported from di&s;tant climates, often degenerate, and &s;ometimes come to perfection, in a few generations. This effect, it is obvious, is produced by the difference of climate and of food. The operation of the&s;e two cau&s;es mu&s;t, in proce&s;s of time, render &s;uch animals exempt from, or &s;u&s;ceptible of certain affections, or cer|tain di&s;ea&s;es. Their temperament mu&s;t &s;uffer a gradual change. Of cour&s;e, their form, which partly depends on food and the qualities of the humours, mu&s;t al&s;o, in the cour&s;e of generations, &s;uffer an alteration. This change, it is true, is hardly perceptible in the fir&s;t generation; be|cau&s;e the male and female, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the origin of this race, being fully grown, had received their form and &s;tructure before they <PB N="347" REF="353"> were tran&s;ported. The new climate and new food may change their temperament; but cannot have influence upon the &s;olid and organic parts &s;ufficient to alter their form. The fir&s;t genera|tion of the&s;e animals, therefore, will not &s;uffer any change in their figure; nor, at the in&s;tant of birth, will the &s;tock be vitiated or depraved. But the young and tender &s;tranger will feel a much &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion from the climate than its father or mother experienced. The opera|tion of food will likewi&s;e be &s;o great as to in|fluence the organic parts during the time of the animal's growth: A change will, of cour&s;e, be introduced into its form; the &s;eeds of imperfec|tion will be &s;own, and appear, in a &s;en&s;ible man|ner, in the &s;econd generation, which will not only labour under its own proper defects, or tho&s;e proceeding from its growth and nouri&s;h|ment, but inherit all the vices of the &s;econd &s;tock. La&s;tly, the imperfections and deformities tran&s;|mitted to the third generation, being combined with the influence of the climate and food du|ring the growth of the animal, will become &s;o great as to obliterate entirely the characters of the original &s;tock. Hence, in a few generations, animals tran&s;ported into a climate different from their own, lo&s;e all their di&s;tinctive qualities, and acquire tho&s;e peculiar to the country they are obliged to inhabit. In France, Spani&s;h or Bar|bary hor&s;es, when the breed is not cro&s;&s;ed, be|come French hor&s;es &s;ometimes in the &s;econd ge|neration, <PB N="348" REF="354"> and always in the third. In&s;tead of pre&s;erving the breed di&s;tinct, therefore, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s it every generation, by admitting Spani&s;h or Barbary hor&s;es to the mares of the country. It is &s;ingular, that this renewing of the race, which is only partial, produces better effects than if it were complete. A Spani&s;h hor&s;e and mare will not produce &s;uch fine hor&s;es in France, as tho&s;e bred from a Spani&s;h hor&s;e and a French mare. This may ea&s;ily be con|ceived, if we attend to the compen&s;ation of de|fects which nece&s;&s;arily happens, when males and females of different countries are allowed to in|termix. Every climate, by its influence, joined to that of the food, gives a certain conformation of parts, which errs either by exce&s;s or defect. When a warm climate produces redundancies in particular parts, a cold climate gives ri&s;e to deficiencies in the &s;ame parts: Hence, when a|nimals of oppo&s;ite climates intermix, an exact compen&s;ation is effected. As the mo&s;t perfect work of nature is that in which there are fewe&s;t defects, and as the mo&s;t perfect forms are tho&s;e which have fewe&s;t deformities, the production of two animals, who&s;e faults exactly compen&s;ate each other, will be the mo&s;t perfect of the kind. Now, this compen&s;ation being always complete&s;t, when animals of remote, or rather of oppo&s;ite climates are joined, the compound re&s;ulting from the mixture is more or le&s;s perfect, in proportion as the exce&s;s or defects in the con&s;titution of <PB N="349" REF="355"> the father are oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e peculiar to the mother.</P>
<P>To have good hor&s;es, therefore, in the tempe|rate climate of France, &s;tallions &s;hould be brought from the warme&s;t or the colde&s;t countries. The Arabian or Barbary hor&s;es ought to have the preference; and, after them, tho&s;e of Spain and of Naples. With regard to cold climates, the hor&s;es of Denmark &s;hould be preferred, and, next to them, tho&s;e of Hol&s;tein and Frie&s;land. All the&s;e &s;tallions, when admitted to French mares, will produce very fine hor&s;es; and they will al|ways be better and more beautiful, in propor|tion as the climate is more remote from that of France; &s;o that the Arabian hor&s;e is preferable to the Barb, and the Barb to the Spani&s;h. In the &s;ame manner, &s;tallions brought from Denmark will produce finer hor&s;es than tho&s;e brought from Frie&s;land. When &s;tallions from very warm or very cold countries cannot be procured, they &s;hould be brought from England or Ger|many, or even from the &s;outhern provinces of France to the northern. Some advantage is always obtained by &s;erving mares with &s;trange hor&s;es; for, when tho&s;e of the &s;ame race, and in the &s;ame &s;tud, are allowed to intermix, they infallibly degenerate in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The influence of climate and of food upon the human &s;pecies, is not &s;o great as upon other animals. The rea&s;on is obvious. Man defends him&s;elf better than any other animal from the <PB N="350" REF="356"> intemperance of the climate. He accommodates his lodging and his cloaths to the nature of the &s;ea&s;on. His food is more various, and, con&s;e|quently, does not operate in the &s;ame manner upon every individual. The defects or redun|dancies which proceed from the&s;e two cau&s;es, and which are &s;o con&s;tant and &s;o perceptible in the animals, are by no means equally con&s;picu|ous in man. As migrations have often happen|ed, as whole nations have intermixed, and as many men travel and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves through every quarter of the globe, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the human race are le&s;s &s;ubject to the in|fluence of climate, and that &s;trong, hand&s;ome, and even ingenious men, are to be found in e|very country. It is probable, however, that, from an experience, of which all remembrance is now lo&s;t, men had di&s;covered the evils that re&s;ult from alliances of the &s;ame blood; for, e|ven among the mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed nations, a bro|ther has rarely been permitted to marry his &s;i&s;ter. This cu&s;tom, which, among Chri&s;tians, is a di|vine law, and which is ob&s;erved by other people from political motives, may have originally been founded on ob&s;ervation. Policy, unle&s;s when derived from phy&s;ical con&s;iderations, never ex|tends in a manner &s;o general and &s;o ab&s;olute. But, if men once di&s;covered by experience that their race degenerated, when intercour&s;e was permitted among children of the &s;ame family, they would &s;oon regard the alliances of different <PB N="351" REF="357"> families, as a law e&s;tabli&s;hed by Nature. In a word, we may pre&s;ume from analogy, that, in mo&s;t climates, men, like other animals, would degenerate after a certain number of genera|tions.</P>
<P>The variety in the colour of animals is ano|ther effect to be a&s;cribed to the influence of cli|mate and food. Wild animals which live in the &s;ame climate, are of the &s;ame colour, varying only in brightne&s;s or deepne&s;s, according to the &s;ea&s;ons of the year. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, which live under different climates, differ likewi&s;e in colour; and dome&s;tic animals are &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly varied, that we have hor&s;es, dogs, cats, &amp;c. of every kind of colour. But the &s;tag, the hare, &amp;c. are uniformly of the &s;ame colour. The injuries received from the climate, which are always the &s;ame, and the con&s;tant eating of the &s;ame food, produce this uniformity in the wild animals. The care of man, the luxury of &s;helter, and the variety of nouri&s;hment, ef|face and variegate the original colours in do|me&s;tic animals. The mixture of foreign races, e&s;pecially when the males and females are not of the &s;ame colour, produce the &s;ame effect, and &s;ometimes give ri&s;e to beautiful varieties, as the pied hor&s;es, in which the white and black are often di&s;po&s;ed in a manner &s;o fanciful, as to &s;eem to be rather the operation of art than of nature.</P>
<P>In coupling hor&s;es, regard &s;hould be had to the &s;tature and the colour: The figures &s;hould <PB N="352" REF="358"> be contra&s;ted, and the breed cro&s;&s;ed by &s;tallions from the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite climates. Hor&s;es and mares brought up in the &s;ame &s;tud &s;hould never be allowed to intermix. The&s;e are e&s;&s;ential re|qui&s;ites. But there are other circum&s;tances which ought not to be neglected. For example, in a &s;tud, no mares, with &s;hort tails, &s;hould be kept; becau&s;e, being unable to defend them&s;elves from the flies, they are perpetually tormented. The continual agitation occa&s;ioned by the &s;tinging of the&s;e in&s;ects, dimini&s;hes the quantity of milk, which has &s;o great an influence on the con&s;titu|tion and &s;tature of the foal, that its vigour is al|ways proportioned to the goodne&s;s of its nur&s;e. Brood-mares &s;hould be cho&s;en from tho&s;e which have been always pa&s;tured, and never fatigued with labour. Mares which have been long nou|ri&s;hed in a &s;table with dry food, and afterwards turned out to gra&s;s, conceive not at fir&s;t. Time is nece&s;&s;ary to accu&s;tom them to this new kind of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The common &s;ea&s;on of mares is from the be|ginning of April to the end of June; but the ardour of &s;ome not unfrequently appears at a more early period. An ardour &s;o premature &s;hould be repre&s;&s;ed; becau&s;e the foal would be brought forth in cold weather, and, con&s;equent|ly, &s;uffer both from the intemperance of the &s;ea&s;on, and from bad milk. If this ardour ap|pears not till after the month of June, it &s;hould likewi&s;e be repre&s;&s;ed; becau&s;e the foal would be <PB N="353" REF="359"> produced in &s;ummer, and would not acquire &s;trength enough to re&s;i&s;t the rigours of winter.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of conducting the &s;tallion to the mare, it is not uncommon to allow him to go loo&s;e in the parks where the mares are feeding, and to &s;ingle out &s;uch as are in &s;ea&s;on. By this me|thod the mares conceive more readily. But it injures the &s;tallion more in &s;ix weeks, than he would be by &s;ix years exerci&s;e, moderated and conducted in the manner above directed.</P>
<P>When the impregnated mares begin to grow heavy, they &s;hould be &s;eparated from tho&s;e which are not in that condition, to prevent them from receiving any injury. Their period of ge&s;tation is generally eleven months and &s;ome days. They bring forth in a &s;tanding po&s;ture, while almo&s;t all other quadrupeds lie down. When the de|livery is difficult, they require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man; and, when the foal is dead, it is extracted with cords. As in mo&s;t animals, the colt fir&s;t pre&s;ents its head. In e&s;caping from the uterus, it breaks the membranes, and the waters flow a|bundantly. The waters are accompanied with &s;everal &s;olid ma&s;&s;es, formed by the &s;ediment of the liquor of the allantoides. Tho&s;e ma&s;&s;es, called
<HI>hippomanes</HI> by the antients, are not, as they &s;up|po&s;ed, pieces of fle&s;h attached to the head of the foal. They are, on the contrary, &s;eparated from the foal by the <HI>amnios.</HI> Immediately after birth, the mare licks the foal: But &s;he never touches <PB N="354" REF="360"> the <HI>hippomanes,</HI> though the antients a&s;&s;ert that &s;he in&s;tantly devours it.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual to cover a mare nine days after &s;he has foaled, that no time may be lo&s;t, and that every po&s;&s;ible profit may be derived from the &s;tud. It is certain, however, that her &s;trength being divided, &s;he is unable to nouri&s;h both a foal and a foetus &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully as if &s;he had but one at a time. To procure excellent hor&s;es, therefore, the mares &s;hould be covered but once in two years, which would make them live long|er, and hold more &s;urely; for, in ordinary &s;tuds, it is well if a half or two thirds bring forth in a year.</P>
<P>Mares, though impregnated, can &s;uffer to be covered; and yet there are no in&s;tances of &s;u|perfoetation. In general, they are capable of producing to the age of 14 or 15 years, and the mo&s;t vigorous produce not after 18. Stallions, when properly managed, retain their prolific powers to the age of 20 years, and &s;ometimes longer: And, as in man, tho&s;e which began too early are &s;oone&s;t extingui&s;hed; for the large hor&s;es, which come &s;ooner to maturity than fine ones, and are employed as &s;tallions at the age of four years, are commonly u&s;ele&s;s at 15.</P>
<P>The life of hor&s;es, as in every other &s;pecies of animals, is proportioned to the time of their growth. Man, who grows 14 years, can live &s;ix or &s;even times as long, i. e. 90 or 100. The hor&s;e, who&s;e growth is accompli&s;hed in four <PB N="355" REF="361"> years, can live &s;ix or &s;even times as much, i. e. 25 or 30. The exceptions to this rule are &s;o few, that no conclu&s;ions can be drawn from them: And, as the large hor&s;es come &s;ooner to maturity than the delicate ones, their lives are likewi&s;e &s;horter, and they are &s;uperannuated in 15 years.</P>
<P>In hor&s;es, and mo&s;t other quadrupeds, the growth of the po&s;terior parts &s;eems at fir&s;t to be greater than that of the anterior. But, in man, the growth of the inferior parts is at fir&s;t le&s;s than that of the &s;uperior: For the thighs and legs of infants are, in proportion to their bodies, much le&s;s than tho&s;e of adults. The hinder legs of the foal, on the contrary, are &s;o long that they can reach his head, which is by no means the ca&s;e after he acquires his full growth. But this difference proceeds not &s;o much from the ine|quality in the total growth of the anterior and po&s;terior parts, as from the unequal lengths of the fore and hind feet, which uniformly holds through all nature, and is mo&s;t remarkable in quadrupeds. Man's feet are larger, and like|wi&s;e &s;ooner formed, than his hands. The great|e&s;t part of the hor&s;e's hind leg is only a foot, be|ing compo&s;ed of bones corre&s;ponding to the tar&s;us, metatar&s;us, &amp;c. It is not, therefore, &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that this foot &s;hould be &s;ooner expand|ed than the fore-leg, the inferior part of which repre&s;ents the hand, being compo&s;ed of the bones of the carpus, metacarpus, &amp;c. This difference <PB N="356" REF="362"> is ea&s;ily perceived immediately after a foal is brought forth. The fore-legs, when compared with the hind ones, are proportionably much &s;horter than they are to be afterwards. Be&s;ides, the thickne&s;s which the body acquires, though independent of the proportional growth in length, increa&s;es the di&s;tance between the hind|feet and the head, and, con&s;equently, prevents the animal, when full grown, from reaching it.</P>
<P>In all animals, each &s;pecies varies according to the climates; and the general re&s;ults of the&s;e varieties con&s;titute different races. Of the&s;e we can only di&s;tingui&s;h the mo&s;t remarkable, or tho&s;e that &s;en&s;ibly differ from each other, pa&s;&s;ing over the intermediate &s;hades, which here, as in all the operations of nature, are infinite. We have even augmented their mumber and confu|&s;ion by cheri&s;hing the mixture of races. If the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, we have dealt roughly with nature by bringing into our climates the hor&s;es of A&s;ia and of Africa. By introducing into France the hor&s;es of every country, the primitive race cannot now be recogni&s;ed; &s;o that, to di&s;tingui&s;h hor&s;es, there remains only a few &s;light characters produced by the actual influence of the climate. The&s;e characters would be &s;till better marked, and the differences more &s;en&s;ible, if the races of each climate were pre|&s;erved without mixture. The&s;e &s;mall varieties would be more apparent, and le&s;s numerous. <PB N="357" REF="363"> But there would be a certain number of great varieties, which every man could di&s;tingui&s;h with ea&s;e. In&s;tead of which, habit, and even long experience, are nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to know the hor&s;es of different countries. On this &s;ubject we have no light but what is derived from the books of travellers, the works of New|ca&s;tle, Gar&s;ault, Gueriniere, &amp;c. and &s;ome re|marks communicated to us by M. de Pignerolles, ma&s;ter of hor&s;e to the King of France, and pre|&s;ident of the academy of Angers.</P>
<P>The Arabian hor&s;es are the mo&s;t beautiful. They are larger, more fle&s;hy, and hand&s;omer than the Barbs. But, as they are &s;eldom brought into France, few ob&s;ervations have been made with regard to their perfections or defects.</P>
<P>Barbary hor&s;es are more common. They have a long, fine neck, not overcharged with hair, and well divided from the withers. The head is &s;mall and beautiful. The ears are hand&s;ome and properly placed. The &s;houlders are light and flat. The withers are thin and well rai&s;ed. The back is &s;traight and &s;hort. The flank and &s;ides are round, and the belly not too large. The haunch-bones are properly concealed; the crupper is &s;ome|what long, and the tail placed rather high. The thigh is well formed, and rarely flat. The limbs are fine, hand&s;ome, and not hairy. The tendon is prominent, and the foot well made; but the pa&s;tern is often long. They are of all colours, but generally grayi&s;h. In their movements, they <PB N="358" REF="364"> are apt to be carele&s;s, and require to be checked. They are &s;wift, nervous, light, and make ex|tremely fine hunters. The&s;e hor&s;es appear to be the mo&s;t proper for improving the breed. Their &s;tature, however, is not &s;o large as could be wi&s;hed. They are &s;eldom above four feet eight inches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fourteen hands and a half.</NOTE>, and never exceed four feet nine. It is confirmed by repeated experience, that, in France, England, &amp;c. they produce foals which grow larger than their parents. Of the Barba|ry hor&s;es, tho&s;e of the kingdom of Morocco are &s;aid to be the be&s;t, and next to the&s;e are the Barbs from the mountains. The hor&s;es of Mau|ritania are of an inferior quality, as well as tho&s;e of Turkey, Per&s;ia, and Armenia. All the hor&s;es of warm climates have &s;moother and &s;horter hair than tho&s;e of other countries. The Turki&s;h hor&s;es are not &s;o well proportioned as the Barbs. Their necks are generally &s;lender, their bodies long, and their legs too thin. They are, however, excellent travellers, and have a long wind. It will not be thought &s;urpri&s;ing, that the bones of animals are harder in warm than in cold climates. It is for this rea&s;on, that, though they have thinner &s;hank bones than the hor&s;es of this country, their limbs are &s;tronger.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h hor&s;es, which hold the &s;econd rank after the Barbs, have a long, thick, hairy neck. The head is rather gro&s;s and fle&s;hy. The ears are <PB N="359" REF="365"> long, but well &s;ituated. The eyes are full of fire, and their air is bold and noble. The &s;houl|ders are thick and the che&s;t broad. The reins are often a little low, the &s;ides round, and the belly frequently too big. The crupper is gene|rally round and large, though in &s;ome it is &s;ome|what long. The limbs are fine and not hairy; the tendons in the legs are prominent; the pa|&s;tern is &s;ometimes too long, like that of the Barb; the foot is rather long, like that of the mule; and the heel is often too high. The Spani&s;h hor&s;es of the be&s;t race are thick, plump, and of a low &s;tature. Their movements are likewi&s;e quick and &s;upple; and they are re|markable for &s;pirit and boldne&s;s. Their colour is commonly black, or a dark che&s;nut, though they are to be found of all colours. Their no&s;es and limbs are &s;eldom white. The&s;e marks are di&s;liked by the Spaniards, who never breed from tho&s;e which have them. Their favourite mark is a &s;tar in the fore-head; and they e&s;teem a hor&s;e without a &s;ingle &s;pot, as much as we de&s;pi&s;e him. Both of the&s;e prejudices, though oppo&s;ite to each other, are perhaps equally ill founded; for we find excellent hor&s;es with all kinds of marks, or with no marks whatever. The&s;e little differences in the coats of hor&s;es, &s;eem to have no dependence on their di&s;po&s;i|tions or internal con&s;titution; but take their ri&s;e from external circum&s;tances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is, perhaps, not altogether true; for, it is generally remarked, that white or light coloured animals are not &s;o &s;trong and hardy as tho&s;e of darker colours. It is found by experience, that tho&s;e legs of hor&s;es which have much white upon them, are apte&s;t to &s;well and turn grea&s;y; and the white &s;pots occa&s;ioned by wounds &s;eem to indicate a parti|cular weakne&s;s in the parts.</NOTE>; for a &s;light <PB N="360" REF="366"> wound on the &s;kin produces a white &s;pot. Be|&s;ides, Spani&s;h hor&s;es, of whatever kind, are all marked in the thigh, with the mark of the &s;tud from which they were taken. They are gene|rally of a &s;mall &s;tature, though &s;ome of them are four feet nine or ten inches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fourteen hands and a half.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e of Up|per Andalu&s;ia are &s;aid to be the be&s;t, though their heads be often too long. But their other rare and excellent qualities make this fault be overlooked. They are obedient, couragious, graceful, &s;pirited, and more docile than the Barbs. For tho&s;e talents they are preferred to all the hor&s;es of the world, for the purpo&s;es of war, of pomp, or of the manage.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t Engli&s;h hor&s;es, in their conforma|tion, re&s;emble tho&s;e of Arabia and Barbary, from which they originally &s;prung. Their heads, however, are too large, though hand&s;ome; and their ears are too long, but well &s;ituated. By the ears alone, an Engli&s;h hor&s;e may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from a Barb. But the great difference lies in their &s;tature; for the Engli&s;h hor&s;es are much larger and plumper, being commonly four feet ten, and even five feet high<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">15 hands high.</NOTE>. They are of all colours, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by every &s;ort of <PB N="361" REF="367"> mark. They are generally &s;trong, vigorous, hardy, capable of enduring much fatigue, and excellent either for hunting or the cour&s;e. But they want grace and docility; they are &s;tiff, and have little play in their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h race-hor&s;es are extremely fleet, and are managed with great dexterity by their riders. I cannot give a better example than by relating the &s;ub&s;tance of a letter I received from a re&s;pectable nobleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Morton.</NOTE>, dated <HI>London,</HI> 18. <HI>Feb.</HI> 1748. Mr Thornhill, po&s;t-ma&s;ter of Stilton, laid a bet, that he would ride three times the road from Stilton to London, or 215 Engli&s;h miles, in 15 hours. He &s;et out from Stilton on the 29th day of April 1745, and, after mount|ing eight different hor&s;es on the road, arrived at London in three hours fifty-one minutes. He in&s;tantly &s;et off from London, and, having mounted only &s;ix hor&s;es, he reached Stilton in three hours fifty-two minutes. For the third cour&s;e, he u&s;ed &s;even of the &s;ame hor&s;es, and fi|ni&s;hed it in three hours forty-nine minutes. So that he not only gained his bet, but, in&s;tead of fifteen hours, he had performed what he had undertaken in eleven hours thirty-two minutes. I &s;u&s;pect that no example of &s;uch fleetne&s;s was ever exhibited at the Olympic games.</P>
<P>The Italian hor&s;es were formerly much hand|&s;omer than they are now; becau&s;e, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, the breed has been neglected. How|ever, the Neapolitan hor&s;es are &s;till excellent for <PB N="362" REF="368"> carriages. But, in general, they have large heads and thick necks; they are al&s;o untrac|table, and, of cour&s;e, not ea&s;ily managed. The&s;e defects are compen&s;ated by the &s;tateline&s;s of their form, by their high &s;pirit, and by the grace|fulne&s;s of their motions.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h hor&s;es, both on account of &s;ize and beauty, are preferred to all others for car|riages. Some of them are perfect models; but their number is &s;mall: For mo&s;t of them are not very regularly formed, having thick necks, gro&s;s &s;houlders, backs too long and too low, and cruppers too narrow in proportion to the thick|ne&s;s of their fore-parts. But they are all grace|ful in their movements; and, in general, they are excellent for war and for pomp. They are of all colours; and the tiger-&s;potted hor&s;es are peculiar to Denmark.</P>
<P>Germany produces very &s;ine hor&s;es: But, though generally bred from Barbary, Turki&s;h, Spani&s;h, and Italian hor&s;es, mo&s;t of them are heavy and &s;hort-winded; and therefore ill qualified for hunting or cour&s;ing. The hor&s;es of Hungary and Tran&s;ylvania, on the contrary, are light and nimble. To prevent their neigh|ing in time of war, and al&s;o, it is &s;aid, to improve their wind, the Hungarians &s;lit the no&s;trils of their hor&s;es. I have never had an opportunity of a&s;certaining the fact, that hor&s;es, who&s;e no|&s;trils are &s;lit, lo&s;e the power of neighing. But I &s;hould rather imagine, that this operation only <PB N="363" REF="369"> renders their neighing more feeble. It is re|marked of the Hungarian, Croatian, and Poli&s;h hor&s;es, that they are noted for retaining what is called the <HI>mark</HI> in their teeth till they be very old.</P>
<P>The Dutch hor&s;es an&s;wer very well for draw|ing coaches, and are commonly u&s;ed in France for that purpo&s;e. The be&s;t kind are brought from the province of Frie&s;land: Tho&s;e of Bergue and Juliers are al&s;o very good. The Flemi&s;h hor&s;es are much inferior to the Dutch. Almo&s;t the whole of them have large heads, and broad feet; and their legs are &s;ubject to humours. The&s;e two la&s;t faults render them very unfit for carriages.</P>
<P>In France there are hor&s;es of all kinds; but few of them are hand&s;ome. The be&s;t &s;addle|hor&s;es are brought from the Limo&s;in. They re&s;emble the Barbs, and are excellent for the chace. But they grow very &s;lowly, require much care when young, and mu&s;t not be u&s;ed till they arrive at the age of eight years. There are likewi&s;e good ponies in Auvergne, Poitou, and Burgundy. But, next to the Limo&s;in, Nor|mandy furni&s;hes the fine&s;t hor&s;es. They are not &s;o good for the chace; but they make bet|ter war-hor&s;es. They are plump, and &s;oon ac|quire their full growth. Good coach-hor&s;es, lighter and more alert than tho&s;e of Holland, are bred in Lower Normandy and Cotentin. Franche-Comt&eacute; and the Boulonnois furni&s;h us <PB N="364" REF="370"> with very good draught-hor&s;es. In general, the French hor&s;es have their &s;houlders too wide, while tho&s;e of the Barb are too narrow.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cribed tho&s;e hor&s;es with which we are be&s;t acquainted, we &s;hall now give the rela|tions of travellers concerning foreign hor&s;es, of which we have little knowledge. There are good hor&s;es in all the i&s;lands of the Archipela|go. Among the antients, the hor&s;es of Crete were in high e&s;timation for agility and &s;wift|ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;crip. des i&s;les de l'Archipel, par Dapper, p. 402.</NOTE>. However, hor&s;es are now little u&s;ed in that i&s;land, on account of the ruggedne&s;s of the country, which is every where mountainous, and full of inequalities. The be&s;t hor&s;es in the&s;e i&s;lands, and even in Barbary, are of the Arabian race. The native hor&s;es of the kingdom of Morocco are much &s;maller than tho&s;e of Arabia, but very nimble and vigorous<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 2. p. 124.</NOTE>. Mr Shaw al|ledges
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, that the breed of Egypt and of Tingi|tania is &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the neighbouring countries; and yet, more than a century ago, excellent hor&s;es were found throughout all Bar|bary: The&s;e Barbary hor&s;es, he &s;ays, never &s;tumble; and they &s;tand &s;till when the rider di&s;|mounts, or drops the bridle. They walk very fa&s;t, and gallop with great rapidity; but they are never allowed to trot or amble, the&s;e move|ments being con&s;idered by the natives as rude <PB N="365" REF="371"> and vulgar. He adds, that the Egyptian hor&s;es are &s;uperior to all others both in &s;tature and in beauty. But the&s;e Egyptian, as well as mo&s;t of the hor&s;es of Barbary, &s;prung originally from the Arabians, which are unque&s;tionably the hand&s;ome&s;t hor&s;es in the world.</P>
<P>According to Marmol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 50.</NOTE>, or rather Leo Afri|canus
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Leo. Afric. de Africae de&s;cript. tom. 2. p. 750.</NOTE>, whom Marmol has copied almo&s;t ver|batim, the Arabian hor&s;es are de&s;cended from the wild hor&s;es in the de&s;erts of Arabia, of which &s;tuds were formed very antiently, and which multiplied &s;o greatly, as to &s;pread over all A&s;ia and Africa. They are &s;o &s;wift as to out-run the o&s;trich. The Arabs of the de&s;ert and the people of Lybia rear numbers of the&s;e hor&s;es for the chace. They never u&s;e them either in war, or for travelling. They pa&s;ture them as long as the gra&s;s remains, and, when it fails, they feed them with dates and camel's milk, which make them nervous, light, and meagre. They catch the wild hor&s;es in &s;nares, and, when young, they eat their fle&s;h, which they e&s;teem to be very delicate. The&s;e wild hor&s;es are &s;mall, and commonly of an a&s;h-colour, though &s;ome of them are white; and the hair of the mane and tail is &s;hort and cri&s;ped. Curious relations, concerning the Arabian hor&s;es, are given by o|ther travellers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de M. de la Roque, p. 194, et l'hi&s;t. generale des voyages, tom. 2. p. 626.</NOTE>, of which I &s;hall only mention &s;ome of the principal facts.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="372"> There is not an Arabian, however poor, who has not his hor&s;es.

The fir&s;t, which are of a pure and antient race on both &s;ides, they call Nobles; the &s;econd are likewi&s;e of an antient race, but have been de|graded by vulgar alliances; and the third cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of their common hor&s;es. The latter &s;ell at a low price. But tho&s;e of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and even of the &s;econd, among which &s;ome indivi|duals are not inferior to the nobles, are exce&s;|&s;ively dear. Mares of the noble cla&s;s are never permitted to be covered but by hor&s;es of the &s;ame quality. The Arabs, by long experience, know all the races of their hor&s;es, as well as tho&s;e of their neighbours. They know their <PB N="368" REF="374"> names, &s;irnames, colours, peculiar marks, &amp;c. When a family have no noble &s;tallions, they borrow one of a neighbour to cover their mares, which is performed in pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es, who give an atte&s;tation of it, &s;igned and &s;ealed, be|fore the &s;ecretary of the Emir, or &s;ome other public per&s;on. This atte&s;tation contains the names of the hor&s;e and mare, and a complete hi&s;tory of their pedigrees. When the mare has foaled, witne&s;&s;es are again called, and another atte&s;tation is made, including a de&s;cription of the foal, and the day of its birth. The&s;e atte&s;ta|tions enhance the value of their hor&s;es, and they are always delivered to the purcha&s;ers. The &s;malle&s;t mares of this fir&s;t cla&s;s are worth 500 crowns; and many of them &s;ell at a 1000 crowns; and even higher prices are &s;ometimes given. As the Arabs live in tents, the&s;e tents &s;erve them likewi&s;e for &s;tables. The mare and her foal, the hu&s;band and his wife and children, &s;leep together promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The infants of|ten lie on the body, or on the neck of the mare or foal, without receiving any injury from the&s;e animals, which &s;eem afraid to move, for fear of hurting them. The&s;e mares are &s;o accu&s;tom|ed to &s;ociety, that they &s;ubmit to every kind of familiarity. The Arabs never beat their mares; but treat them gently, and talk and rea&s;on with them. They are &s;o careful of them as to allow them always to walk, and never &s;pur them, un|le&s;s the occa&s;ion be very urgent. Hence, when|ever <PB N="369" REF="375"> the creatures perceive the rider's heel make an approach to their &s;ides, they in&s;tantly &s;et off with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, and leap hedges and ditches as nimbly as &s;tags. If their riders chances to fall, they are &s;o well trained, that they &s;top &s;hort, even in the mo&s;t rapid gallop. All the Arabian hor&s;es are of a middle &s;tature, very ea&s;y in their carriage, and rather meagre than fat. They are dre&s;&s;ed every morning and evening with &s;o much care, that not a &s;pot of dirt is left on their &s;kin, and their legs, mane, and tail, are wa&s;hed. Their tails are allowed to grow long; and the comb is &s;eldom u&s;ed, to prevent the hair from being broken. During the day, they are not permitted to eat; but are watered twice or thrice. At &s;un-&s;et, a bag, containing about half a bu&s;hel of barley, is pa&s;|&s;ed over their heads, and fa&s;tened to the neck. This bag is not removed till next morning, when the barley is entirely con&s;umed. In the month of March, when the gra&s;s is good, they are turned out to pa&s;ture. This is al&s;o the &s;ea|&s;on in which the mares are covered; and, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, water is employed in the &s;ame manner as in other countries. After the &s;pring is pa&s;t, the hor&s;es are taken from the pa&s;ture; and, during the re&s;t of the year, they are allow|ed neither gra&s;s nor hay, and rarely &s;traw, barley being their only food. At the age of a year or ten months, the Arabians cut the manes of their foals, with a view to make them grow long and <PB N="370" REF="376"> bu&s;hy. When two years, or two years and a half old, they are mounted, having never, before that period, been either &s;addled or bridled. Every day, from morning to night, all the Arabian hor|&s;es &s;tand &s;addled at the tent-doors.</P>
<P>This race of hor&s;es is &s;pread over all Barbary; and the great men among the Moors, and even among the Negroes along the Gambia and Se|negal, have Arabian hor&s;es of great beauty. In|&s;tead of barley or oats, they are fed with maize, reduced to a powder, which is mixed with milk, when they require to be fattened. In this warm climate, they are allowed little water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. generale des voyages, tom. 3. p. 297.</NOTE>. On the other hand, the Arabian hor&s;es are di&s;|per&s;ed over Egypt, Turkey, and, perhaps, Per&s;ia, where very con&s;iderable &s;tuds were formerly kept. Marc Paul<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">La de&s;cript. geog. de l'Inde, par Marc Paul, tom. 1. p. 41. et liv. 1. p. 21.</NOTE> mentions one of the&s;e &s;tuds which contained ten thou&s;and white mares; and he &s;ays, that, in the Province of Bala&s;cia, there is a va&s;t number of large nimble hor&s;es, with hoofs &s;o hard as to require no &s;hoes.</P>
<P>The Levant hor&s;es, like tho&s;e of Per&s;ia and Arabia, have very hard hoofs: They are &s;hoed, however; but with &s;hoes extremely light and thin. In Turkey, Per&s;ia, and Arabia, the &s;ame manner of feeding and dre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es is ob|&s;erved. Their litter is made of their own dung, which is fir&s;t dried in the &s;un, to remove <PB N="371" REF="377"> the di&s;agreeable &s;mell, and then reduced into a powder. Of this a bed is laid in the &s;table or tent, about four or five inches thick. This lit|ter la&s;ts very long; for, after being &s;oiled, it is dried a &s;econd time in the &s;un, which clears it entirely from its offen&s;ive odour.</P>
<P>In Turkey there are Arabian, Tartarian, and Hungarian hor&s;es, be&s;ide the native hor&s;es of that country, which la&s;t are exceedingly hand&s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage de M.

They eat little, are ea&s;ily heat|ed, and their &s;kin is &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that they are unable to bear the friction of a comb; in place of which, they are bru&s;hed, and wa&s;hed with water. The&s;e hor&s;es, though beautiful, are in|ferior to the Arabians, and even to tho&s;e of Per|&s;ia; the latter, next to the Arabians<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Les Voyages de Thevenot, tom. 2. p. 220. de Chardin, tom. 2. p. 25.; d'Adam Olearius, tom. 1. p. 560.</NOTE>, being the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t hor&s;es of the Ea&s;t.

Their tails are allowed to grow long; and they are never gelded. Coverings are u&s;ed to defend them from the injuries of the weather. Peculiar care and attention are be&s;towed upon them; and they are managed by a &s;imple bridle, without em|ploying the &s;pur. Great numbers of them are tran&s;ported to Turkey and the Indies. Tho&s;e travellers, who be&s;tow &s;o much prai&s;e upon the Per&s;ian hor&s;es, allow, however, that the Arabi|ans are &s;uperior in agility, courage, &s;trength, and beauty; and that they are more valued, e|ven in Per&s;ia, than the hor&s;es of that country.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es which are bred in the Indies are very indifferent<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p. 256. et Recueil des voyages qui ont &s;ervi &agrave; l'&eacute;tabli&s;&s;ement de la compagnie des Indes, tom. 4. p. 424.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="377" REF="383"> From all the&s;e facts, it is apparent, that the Arabian hor&s;es have always been, and &s;till are, the be&s;t hor&s;es of the world, both for beauty and goodne&s;s; that from them, either directly, or by the mediation of the Barbs, are derived the fine&s;t hor&s;es in Europe, in Africa, and in A&s;ia; that Arabia is, perhaps, not only the ori|ginal climate of hor&s;es, but the be&s;t &s;uited to their con&s;titution; &s;ince, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing the breed by foreign hor&s;es, the natives anxiou&s;ly pre&s;erve the purity of their own race; that, at lea&s;t, if Arabia be not the be&s;t climate for hor&s;es, the Arabs have produced the &s;ame effect, by the &s;crupulous and perpetual attention they have paid towards ennobling the race, and never permit|ting individuals to mix which were not the mo&s;t hand&s;ome, and of the fine&s;t quality; and that, by the &s;ame attention, continued for ages, they have improved the &s;pecies far beyond what Na|ture would have performed in the mo&s;t favour|able climate. It may &s;till farther be concluded, that climates rather warm than cold, and above all, dry countries, are be&s;t adapted to the nature of hor&s;es; that, in general, the &s;mall are better than the large hor&s;es; that care is equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary to them as food; that, by familiarity and care&s;&s;es, we procure more advantage from them, than by force and cha&s;ti&s;ement; that the hor&s;es of warm countries have their bones, hoofs, and mu&s;cles, more firm and compact than tho&s;e of our climates; that, though heat is more con|formable <PB N="378" REF="384"> to the nature of the&s;e animals than cold, yet exce&s;&s;ive heat is exceedingly hurtful to them; that exce&s;&s;ive cold is not le&s;s injurious; and, in fine, that their con&s;titution and di&s;po&s;i|tions depend almo&s;t entirely upon climate, food, care, and education.</P>
<P>The practice of gelding hor&s;es, &s;o generally diffu&s;ed over Europe and China, is unknown in Per&s;ia, Arabia, and many other parts of the ea&s;t. This operation greatly dimini&s;hes their &s;trength, courage, &s;prightline&s;s, &amp;c.; but it endows them with gentlene&s;s, tranquility, and docility. In performing it, the animal is thrown on his back, by means of ropes fixed to his legs; the &s;cro|tum is opened with a &s;harp knife; and the te&s;tes, with their ve&s;&s;els, and the ligaments which &s;up|port them, are removed. The wound is then clo&s;ed up; and the patient is bathed twice a day with cold water. His food, during this period, con&s;i&s;ts of bran drenched in water, with a view to cool him. The operation &s;hould be perform|ed in &s;pring or autumn, much heat, or much cold, being equally dangerous. With regard to the age at which it &s;hould be executed, the prac|tice differs in different places. In certain pro|vinces of France, hor&s;es are gelded at the age of a year or eighteen months, or as &s;oon as the te&s;tes are very apparent without the body. But the mo&s;t general and mo&s;t rational cu&s;tom is to de|lay the operation till the age of two or three years; becau&s;e, when protracted this long, the <PB N="379" REF="385"> animal retains more of the qualities peculiar to the male &s;ex. Pliny &s;ays, that, if a hor&s;e be gelded before he lo&s;es his milk-teeth, they never &s;hed. But I know, from repeated ob&s;ervation, that this remark is fal&s;e. The antients, it is probable, were led into this error, by an analogy drawn from the &s;tag, roe-buck, &amp;c.; for the horns of the&s;e animals never fall off after ca&s;tra|tion. Geldings lo&s;e the power of impregnating; but there are many examples of their being &s;till able to copulate.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es of all colours, like mo&s;t animals co|vered with hair, moult or ca&s;t their hair every year, commonly in the &s;pring, and &s;ometimes in autumn. As they are then weaker than at any other period, they require more care, and &s;hould be more plentifully fed. Some hor&s;es likewi&s;e ca&s;t their hoofs, e&s;pecially in moi&s;t and mar&s;hy countries, as in Holland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this a&s;&s;ertion be true, the ca&s;ting of the hoofs mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome morbid cau&s;e; for no hor&s;es ca&s;t their hoofs, unle&s;s when di&s;ea&s;ed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mares and geldings neigh le&s;s frequently than perfect hor&s;es. Their voices are al&s;o neither &s;o full nor &s;o deep. In hor&s;es of every kind, five different &s;pecies of neighing, expre&s;&s;ive of differ|ent pa&s;&s;ions, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed. In the neigh proceeding from joy, the voice is long protracted, and begins and terminates with &s;harp &s;ounds: The hor&s;e, at the &s;ame time, flings, but without any inclination to &s;trike. In the <PB N="380" REF="386"> neigh of de&s;ire, whether from love or friend|&s;hip, the hor&s;e does not fling, the voice is long continued, and fini&s;hes with graver &s;ounds. The neigh of anger, during which the animal flings and &s;trikes with fury, is very &s;hort and &s;harp. The neigh of fear, during which he al&s;o flings, is not longer than that of anger; the voice is grave and hoar&s;e, and &s;eems as if it proceed|ed entirely from the no&s;trils. This neigh re|&s;embles the roaring of a lion. The noi&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ive of pain is not &s;o much a neigh, as a groan or &s;norting uttered with a grave voice, and following the alternate motions of re&s;pira|tion. It has likewi&s;e been remarked, that hor&s;es which neigh mo&s;t frequently from motives of joy or de&s;ire, are the be&s;t and mo&s;t generous. The voice of unmutilated hor&s;es is &s;tronger than that of geldings or mares. The female voice, even from the moment of birth, is weaker than that of the male. At two years, or two and a half, which is the age of puberty, the voice both of males and females, as in man and other ani|mals, becomes &s;tronger and more grave.</P>
<P>When the hor&s;e is fired with love, he &s;hows his teeth, and has the appearance of laughing. He likewi&s;e &s;hows them when angry and incli|ned to bite. He &s;ometimes thru&s;ts out his tongue to lick, but le&s;s frequently than the ox, though the latter is le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of care&s;&s;es. The hor&s;e remembers injuries much longer than the ox, and is al&s;o more ea&s;ily di&s;pirited. His na|tural <PB N="381" REF="387"> di&s;po&s;ition, which is bold and impetuous, makes him exert his whole force at once; and, when he perceives that &s;till more is requi&s;ite, he grows indignant, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;es to act. But the ox, who is naturally &s;low and &s;lothful, &s;eldom employs his whole &s;trength, and is not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;heartened.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e &s;leeps much le&s;s than man. When in good health, he never lies above two or three hours at a time. He then ri&s;es to eat. After being much fatigued, and after filling his belly, he lies down a &s;econd time. But, upon the whole, he &s;leeps not above three or four hours in the twenty-four. There are al&s;o &s;ome hor&s;es which never lie down, but &s;leep &s;tanding; and even tho&s;e which are accu&s;tomed to lie down, &s;ometimes &s;leep on their feet. It has been re|marked, that geldings &s;leep oftener and longer than perfect hor&s;es.</P>
<P>All quadrupeds drink not in the &s;ame manner, though all are under an equal nece&s;&s;ity of ex|ploring with the head that liquor which they have no other method of apprehending, except|ing the monkey, and &s;ome other animals that have hands, and can drink like man, when a proper ve&s;&s;el is pre&s;ented to them; for they car|ry it to their mouth, pour out the liquor, and &s;wallow it by the &s;imple movement of deglutition. This is the ordinary way in which man drinks, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t commodious. But he can vary his method of drinking, by contracting <PB N="382" REF="388"> the lips, and &s;ucking the fluid, or rather by &s;ink|ing both mouth and no&s;e into it, and then per|forming the motions nece&s;&s;ary to &s;wallowing. He can even &s;eize a fluid by the &s;imple motion of his lips; or, la&s;tly, he can &s;tretch out and expand his tongue, make a kind of little cup of it, and, in this manner, though with &s;ome diffi|culty, &s;atisfy his thri&s;t. Mo&s;t quadrupeds might al&s;o drink in different ways: But, like man, they follow that which is mo&s;t convenient. The dog, who&s;e mouth opens wide, and who&s;e tongue is long and &s;lender, drinks by lapping, or licking, with his tongue, which he forms into a kind of cup or &s;coop, fills at each time, and thus carries a &s;ufficient quantity of fluid into his mouth. This method he prefers to that of dipping his no&s;e into the water. The hor&s;e, on the contrary, who&s;e mouth is too &s;mall, and who&s;e tongue is too thick and too &s;hort, for forming a &s;coop, and who, be&s;ides, drinks with more avidity than he eats, bri&s;kly &s;inks his mouth and no&s;e deep into the water, which he &s;wallows plentifully by the &s;imple motion of deglutition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not always the ca&s;e; for many hor&s;es touch only the &s;urface of the water with their lips, and &s;uck it gently in; and even tho&s;e which dip their no&s;es deeper, never &s;ink the no&s;trils under the water, but breathe freely through them when drinking.</NOTE>. But this obliges him to drink without drawing his breath; while the dog re&s;pires at his no&s;e during the time he is drinking. After running, when the re&s;piration is &s;hort and laborious, hor&s;es &s;hould <PB N="383" REF="389"> be allowed to drink at lei&s;ure, and to breathe as often as they incline. Neither &s;hould they be permitted to drink water that is too cold; for, independent of the colics frequently occa&s;ioned by very cold water, it often cools their no&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as brings on rheums, and perhaps lays the foundation of the di&s;ea&s;e called <HI>glanders,</HI> the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of all maladies to which this noble animal is &s;ubject. It has lately been di&s;covered, that this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;eated in the pituitary mem|brane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de la Fo&s;&s;e, ferrier to the King, fir&s;t demon&s;trated this fact; and he has attempted to cure hor&s;es by the trepan.</NOTE>; and that it is a genuine rheum, which in time produces an inflammation in that mem|brane. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e travellers who give a de|tail of the di&s;ea&s;es of hor&s;es in warm countries, alledge not that the glanders is equally frequent in Arabia, Per&s;ia, and Barbary, as in cold cli|mates. Hence I am led to conjecture, that this malady is owing to the &s;uperior coldne&s;s of the water; becau&s;e the&s;e animals are obliged to keep their no&s;es in the water a con&s;iderable time, which might be prevented by never allowing them to drink very cold water, and by always drying their no&s;trils after drinking. A&s;&s;es, which dread cold more than hor&s;es, and re&s;emble them &s;o greatly in their internal &s;tructure, are not equal|ly &s;ubject to the glanders, which is owing, per|haps, to their drinking in a different manner from the hor&s;e; for, in&s;tead of &s;inking the no&s;e into the water, they barely touch it with their lips.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="390"> I &s;hall mention no more of the di&s;ea&s;es of hor&s;es. It would extend Natural Hi&s;tory be|yond all bounds, if, to the hi&s;tory of each ani|mal, we were to join that of its di&s;ea&s;es. How|ever, I cannot fini&s;h the hi&s;tory of the hor&s;e, without regretting that the health of this u&s;eful and valuable animal &s;hould be &s;till abandoned to the blind care, and often ab&s;urd and cruel practice, of a &s;et of men who have neither un|der&s;tanding nor letters. Of the art, called by the antients Medicina Veterinaria, we now hardly know more than the name. If any phy&s;ician would turn his views to this &s;ubject, and make it a principal object of his inquiry, I am convinced that he would be amply reward|ed for his trouble; and that he would not only acquire a fortune, but obtain the highe&s;t repu|tation. This &s;pecies of the medical art would by no means be conjectural, or &s;o difficult as the other. The manners, the food, the influence of &s;entiment, and all the other cau&s;es of di&s;orders, being le&s;s complicated in the&s;e animals than in man, their di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t al&s;o be more &s;imple, and, of cour&s;e, more ea&s;ily inve&s;tigated and treat|ed with &s;ucce&s;s. To the&s;e advantages may be added the perfect liberty of making experiments, of trying new remedies, and of arriving, with|out fear or reproach, to a mo&s;t exten&s;ive know|ledge of this kind, from which, by analogy, de|ductions might be drawn of the greate&s;t utility to the art of curing men.</P>

<P>WE have already de&s;cribed the manner in which the hor&s;es of Arabia are treated, and given a detail of the pains and attention be|&s;towed on their education. This dry and warm country, which appears to be the original cli|mate of this beautiful animal, and mo&s;t conform|able to its nature, permits or requires a number of u&s;ages that cannot be practi&s;ed, with equal effect, in any other region. In France, and o|ther northern nations, it is impracticable to train and feed hor&s;es in the &s;ame way as is done in warm climates. But men, who are intere&s;ted in the&s;e u&s;eful creatures, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to learn how they are managed in countries le&s;s favoured by heaven than Arabia, and how they conduct them&s;elves, when they act independent of the human &s;pecies, and when left entirely to their own di&s;po&s;itions and in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es are differently fed, according to the different countries to which they are tran&s;ported, and the different u&s;es to which they are de&s;tined. Tho&s;e of the Arabian races intended for hunting in Arabia or Barbary, &s;eldom eat herbage or grain. Their common food, which con&s;i&s;ts of dates and camels milk, is given them every morn|ing <PB N="386" REF="392"> and night. The&s;e aliments, in&s;tead of fat|tening them, render them meagre, nervous, and very fleet. They &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;uck the &s;he|camels, whom they follow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 50.</NOTE> till the time they are ready for mounting, which is not before the age of &s;ix or &s;even years.</P>
<P>In Per&s;ia, the hor&s;es are expo&s;ed night and day to the open air. But, to protect them from the injuries of the weather, from damp vapours, and from rain, they are covered, e&s;pecially in winter, with cloths; and &s;ometimes an addition|al covering is added, which is made of hair, and very thick. A &s;pot of dry even ground is pre|pared for them, greater or &s;maller according to their number, which is &s;wept and kept extreme|ly clean. Here they are all tied to a long rope, which is well &s;tretched, and firmly fixed at each end to two iron rods &s;tuck in the earth. Their halters, however, are &s;ufficiently free to allow them to move with ea&s;e. To prevent them from hurting each other, their hind-legs are tied with a rope, which has iron buckles at each extremity; the&s;e are brought about to the fore part of the hor&s;es, and fa&s;tened to the ground by pegs, but loo&s;e enough to allow them to lie down or to ri&s;e at their plea&s;ure. When put into &s;tables, they are managed in the &s;ame man|ner. Xenophon informs us, that this practice was ob&s;erved in his days; and it is alledged, that, by this means, the animals are rendered <PB N="387" REF="393"> more gentle, and tractable, and le&s;s peevi&s;h a|mong them&s;elves; qualities extremely u&s;eful in war, when vicious hor&s;es, tied up in &s;quadrons, often injure one another. For litter, the Per&s;i|ans u&s;e only &s;and or dry du&s;t, upon which their hor&s;es lie down and &s;leep as well as if it were &s;traw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage della Valle, tom. 5. p. 284.</NOTE>. In other countries, as Arabia and the Mogul empire, the hor&s;es are littered with their own dung, well dried and reduced to a powder<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thevenot, tom. 3. p. 129.</NOTE>. The ea&s;tern hor&s;es are never allowed to eat from the ground, or even from a rack; but are &s;erved with barley and cut &s;traw in pocks tied to their heads; for, in the&s;e climates, no hay is made, nor do the natives cultivate oats. In &s;pring, they are fed with gra&s;s or green barley, and great care is taken to give them only as much as is barely nece&s;&s;ary; for too much nouri&s;hment makes their legs &s;well, and &s;oon renders them u&s;ele&s;s. The&s;e hor&s;es, though ridden without bridle or &s;tirrups, are ea&s;ily managed. They carry their heads very high, by means of a &s;im|ple &s;naffle, and run with great rapidity and &s;ure|ne&s;s upon the wor&s;t roads. The whip and &s;pur are very &s;eldom employed. The latter, when u&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ts only of a &s;ingle point fixed to the heel of the boot. Their common whips are made of &s;mall &s;trips of parchment knotted and twi&s;ted. A few la&s;hes with this whip are &s;uffi|cient for every purpo&s;e of the rider.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="394"> Hor&s;es are &s;o numerous in Per&s;ia, that, though excellent, they &s;ell cheap.

<P>The Norwegian hor&s;es are likewi&s;e &s;mall, but well-proportioned. Mo&s;t of them are yellow, with a black line running the whole length of the back. Some of them are che&s;nut, and others of an iron-gray colour. The&s;e hor&s;es are very &s;ure-footed, travel with great caution through the rough paths of the mountains, and &s;lide down &s;teep declivities, by bringing their hind-feet un|der their bellies. They defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of the bear. When a &s;tallion, in company with mares or foals, perceives this voracious animal, he makes them &s;tay behind, approaches, and boldly attacks the enemy, whom he beats with his fore-feet, and generally kills. But, if the hor&s;es attempt to defend them&s;elves by &s;triking with their hind-feet, they are infallibly gone; for the bear leaps upon their backs, where he &s;ticks with &s;uch force as &s;uffocates them in a &s;hort time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan, hi&s;t. nat. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es of Nordland never exceed four feet and a half in height<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">12 1 half hands.</NOTE>. The nearer we ap|proach <PB N="390" REF="396"> to the pole, we find that hor&s;es become &s;maller and weaker. Tho&s;e of We&s;t Nordland are of a &s;ingular form.

The&s;e hor&s;es are good, &s;eldom re&s;tive or &s;tubborn, and climb with patience the highe&s;t mountains. The pa&s;ture in Nord|land is &s;o excellent, that, when hor&s;es are brought from thence to Stockholm, they &s;eldom remain above a year without lo&s;ing their fle&s;h and their vigour.

In that large and thinly <PB N="392" REF="398"> peopled country comprehended between the Don and the Nieper, the hor&s;es go in troops of three, four, or five hundred, and have no &s;helter even when the ground is covered with &s;now, which they remove with their fore-feet in que&s;t of food. The&s;e troops are guarded by two or three men on hor&s;eback; and it is only in &s;evere win|ters that they are lodged for a few days in the villages, which, in this country, are very di&s;tant from each other.

The&s;e animals, without being mounted or con|ducted by men, march in nearly as good order as our trained cavalry.

<P>In Finland, when the &s;nows are di&s;&s;olved in the month of May, the hor&s;es depart from their ma&s;ters, and go into certain di&s;tricts of the fo|re&s;ts, as if they had previou&s;ly fixed a rendez|vous. There they form different troops, which never &s;eparate or intermix. Each troop take a different di&s;trict of the fore&s;t for their pa&s;ture.

When the gra&s;s is exhau&s;ted, they de|camp, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fre&s;h pa&s;turage in the &s;ame order as before.

<P>The&s;e hor&s;es, which live in troops, and are often removed from the dominion of man, form the link or &s;hade between dome&s;tic and wild hor&s;es.

<P>When formerly treating of the hor&s;e, I re|marked, that, from all the ob&s;ervations of the breeders of hor&s;es, the male appeared to have greater influence upon the offspring than the female; and I then gave &s;ome rea&s;ons which rendered the univer&s;ality of this fact doubtful, and even made it probable that the influence of the male and female were equal. But numerous experiments and ob&s;ervations have now convin|ced me, that, not only in hor&s;es, but in man and every other animal, the male has more influence on the external form of the young than the fe|male, and that, in every &s;pecies, the male is the principal type of the race.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See below, vol. 8. art.

<P>THIS animal, even when examined with minute attention, has the appearance of a degenerated hor&s;e. The exact &s;imilarity in the &s;tructure of the brain, lungs, &s;tomach, inte&s;tinal canal, heart, liver, and other vi&s;cera, and the great re&s;emblance of the body, legs, feet, and whole &s;keleton, &s;eem to &s;upport this opinion. The &s;light differences which take place between the&s;e two animals may be attributed to the long continued influence of climate and food, and to a fortuitous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many generations of &s;mall wild hor&s;es, who, by gradually degenera|ting, at la&s;t produced a new and permanent &s;pe|cies, or rather a race of &s;imilar individuals, all marked with the &s;ame defects, and differing &s;o widely from the genuine hor&s;e, as to be regard|ed as con&s;tituting a new &s;pecies. The greater variety in the colour of hor&s;es than of a&s;&s;es ap|pears to favour this idea: This circum&s;tance <PB N="399" REF="405"> &s;hows that the former have been longer in a do|me&s;tic &s;tate; for the colour of all dome&s;tic ani|mals varies much more than that of wild ones of the &s;ame &s;pecies.

Some wild, as well as dome&s;tic hor&s;es, have likewi&s;e a black line on the back, and other characters which make them nearly approach to the a&s;s.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if we attend to the differ|ences of temperament, di&s;po&s;itions, manners, and, in a word, of the general re&s;ult of the or|ganization of the&s;e two animals, particularly the impo&s;&s;ibility of their commixture, &s;o as to form a common, or even an intermediate &s;pecies, ca|pable of procreating, the opinion, that they were originally di&s;tinct &s;pecies, equally removed from each other as at pre&s;ent, will appear to be the mo&s;t probable.

<P>Philo&s;ophers will perceive the extent, the dif|ficulties, and the importance of this que&s;tion, which we &s;hall here di&s;cu&s;s, only becau&s;e it for the fir&s;t time occurs. It relates to the produc|tion of beings, and, for its illu&s;tration, requires that we &s;hould con&s;ider Nature under a new point of view. If, from the immen&s;e number of animated beings which people the univer&s;e, we &s;elect a &s;ingle animal, or even the human body, as a &s;tandard, and compare all other organized beings with it, we &s;hall find that each enjoys an independent exi&s;tence, and that the whole are di|&s;tingui&s;hed by an almo&s;t infinite variety of gra|dations. There exi&s;ts, at the &s;ame time, a pri|mitive and general de&s;ign, which may be traced to a great di&s;tance, and who&s;e degradations are &s;till &s;lower than tho&s;e of figure or other exter|nal relations: For, not to mention the organs of dige&s;tion, of circulation, or of generation, without which animals could neither &s;ub&s;i&s;t nor reproduce, there is, even among the parts that contribute mo&s;t to variety in external form, &s;uch an amazing re&s;emblance as nece&s;&s;arily conveys the idea of an original plan upon which the whole has been conceived and executed. When, for example, the parts con&s;tituting the body of a hor&s;e, which &s;eems to differ &s;o widely from that of man, are compared in detail with the human frame, in&s;tead of being &s;truck with the differ|ence, <PB N="401" REF="407"> we are a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ingular and al|mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance. In a word, take the &s;keleton of a man, incline the bones of the pel|vis, &s;horten tho&s;e of the thighs, legs, and arms, lengthen the bones of the feet and hands, join the phalanges of the fingers and toes, lengthen the jaws by &s;hortening the frontal bone, and, la&s;tly, extend the &s;pine of the back: This &s;ke|leton would no longer repre&s;ent that of a man, but would be the &s;keleton of a hor&s;e; for, by lenghening the back-bone and the jaws, the number of vertebrae, ribs, and teeth, would like|wi&s;e be augmented; and it is only by the num|ber of the&s;e bones, which may be regarded as acce&s;&s;ory, and by the prolonging, contracting, or junction of others, that the &s;keleton of a hor&s;e differs from the &s;keleton of a man. But, to trace the&s;e relations more minutely, let us examine &s;eparately &s;ome parts which are e&s;&s;ential to the figure of animals, as the ribs: The&s;e we find in man, in all quadrupeds, in birds, in fi&s;h|es, and the ve&s;tiges of them are apparent even in the &s;hell of the turtle: Let us next con&s;ider, that the foot of a hor&s;e, &s;o &s;eemingly different from the hand of a man, is, however, compo&s;ed of the &s;ame bones, and that, at the extremity of each finger, we have the &s;ame &s;mall bone, re|&s;embling a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, which bounds the foot of that animal. From the&s;e facts we may judge, whether this hidden re&s;emblance is not more wonderful than the apparent differences; whe|ther <PB N="402" REF="408"> this con&s;tant uniformity of de&s;ign, to be traced from men to quadrupeds, from quadru|peds to the cetaceous animals, from the ceta|ceous animals to birds, from birds to reptiles, from reptiles to fi&s;hes, &amp;c. in which the e&s;&s;en|tial parts, as the heart, the inte&s;tines, the &s;pine, the &s;en&s;es, &amp;c. are always included, does not in|dicate, that the Supreme Being, in creating ani|mals, employed only one idea, and, at the &s;ame time, diver&s;ified it in every po&s;&s;ible manner, to give men an opportunity of admiring equally the magnificence of the execution and the &s;im|plicity of the de&s;ign?</P>
<P>In this view, not only the hor&s;e and a&s;s, but man, monkeys, quadrupeds, and every &s;pecies of animal, may be con&s;idered as one family. But from this are we warranted to conclude, that, in this great and numerous family, which were brought into exi&s;tence by the Almighty alone, there are le&s;&s;er families conceived by Na|ture, and produced by time, of which &s;ome &s;hould only con&s;i&s;t of two individuals, as the hor&s;e and a&s;s, others of &s;everal individuals, as the wea&s;el, the ferret, the martin, the pole-cat, &amp;c; and, at the &s;ame time, that, among vege|tables, there are families con&s;i&s;ting of ten, twenty, thirty, &amp;c. plants? If the&s;e families really ex|i&s;ted, they could only be produced by the mix|ture and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variation and degeneration of the primary &s;pecies: And, if it be once admitted that there are families among plants and ani|mals, <PB N="403" REF="409"> that the a&s;s belongs to the family of the hor&s;e, and differs from him only by degenera|tion; with equal propriety may it be concluded, that the monkey belongs to the family of man; that the monkey is a man degenerated; that man and the monkey have &s;prung from a common &s;tock, like the hor&s;e and a&s;s; that each family, either among animals or vegetables, has been derived from the &s;ame origin; and even that all animated beings have proceeded from a &s;ingle &s;pecies, which, in the cour&s;e of ages, has pro|duced, by improving and degenerating, all the different races that now exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e naturali&s;ts who, on &s;uch &s;light founda|tions, have e&s;tabli&s;hed families among animals and vegetables, &s;eem not to have con&s;idered, that, if their doctrine were true, it would reduce the product of the creation to any a&s;&s;ignable number of individuals, however &s;mall: For, if it were proved, that animals and vegetables were really di&s;tributed into families, or even that a &s;ingle &s;pecies was ever produced by the degene|ration of another, that the a&s;s, for in&s;tance, was only a degenerated hor&s;e, no bounds could be fixed to the powers of Nature: She might, with equal rea&s;on, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been able, in the cour&s;e of time, to produce, from a &s;ingle individual, all the organized bodies in the uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>But this is by no means a proper repre&s;enta|tion of Nature. We are a&s;&s;ured by the autho|rity <PB N="404" REF="410"> of revelation, that all animals have partici|pated equally of the favours of creation; that the two fir&s;t of each &s;pecies were formed by the hands of the Almighty; and we ought to believe that they were then nearly what their de&s;cen|dants are at pre&s;ent. Be&s;ides, &s;ince Nature was ob&s;erved with attention, &s;ince the days of Ari&s;totle to tho&s;e of our own, no new &s;pecies have appeared, notwith&s;tanding the rapid move|ments which break down and di&s;&s;ipate the parts of matter, notwith&s;tanding the infinite variety of combinations which mu&s;t have taken place during the&s;e twenty centuries, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e fortuitous or forced commixtures between animals of different &s;pecies, from which nothing is produced but barren and vitiated individuals, totally incapable of tran&s;mitting their mon&s;trous kinds to po&s;terity. Were the external or in|ternal re&s;emblances of particular animals, there|fore, &s;till greater than they are between the hor&s;e and a&s;s, they &s;hould not lead us to con|found the&s;e animals, or to a&s;&s;ign them a com|mon origin. For, if they actually proceeded from the &s;ame &s;tock, we would be enabled to bring them back to their primitive &s;tate, and thus, with time, de&s;troy the &s;uppo&s;ed operations of time.</P>
<P>It &s;hould likewi&s;e be con&s;idered, that, though Nature proceeds with gradual, and often imper|ceptible &s;teps; yet the intervals or marks of di|&s;tinction are not always equal. The more dig|nified <PB N="405" REF="411"> the &s;pecies, they are always the le&s;s nu|merous, and &s;eparated by more con&s;picuous &s;hades. The diminutive &s;pecies, on the con|trary, are very numerous, and make nearer ap|proaches towards each other. For this rea&s;on, we are often tempted to erect them into families. But it &s;hould never be forgotten, that the&s;e fa|milies are of our own creation; that we have contrived them to ea&s;e our memories, and to aid our imagination; that, if we cannot comprehend the real relations of all beings, it is our own fault, not that of Nature, who knows none of tho&s;e &s;purious families, and contains, in fact, nothing but individuals.</P>
<P>An individual is a &s;olitary, a detached being, and has nothing in common with other beings, excepting that it re&s;embles, or rather differs from them. All the &s;imilar individuals which exi&s;t on the &s;urface of the earth, are regarded as compo&s;ing the &s;pecies of the&s;e individuals. It is neither, however, the number, nor the collec|tion, of &s;imilar individuals, but the con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion and renovation of the&s;e individuals, which con&s;titutes the &s;pecies. A being, who&s;e duration was perpetual, would not make a &s;pe|cies. Species, then, is an ab&s;tract and general term, the meaning of which can only be appre|hended by con&s;idering Nature in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, and in the con&s;tant de&s;truction and re|novation of beings. It is by comparing pre&s;ent individuals with tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, that we <PB N="406" REF="412"> acquire a clear idea of &s;pecies; for a compari&s;on of the number or &s;imilarity of individuals is only an acce&s;&s;ory idea, and often independent of the fir&s;t: The a&s;s re&s;embles the hor&s;e more than the &s;paniel does the grayhound; and yet the latter are of the &s;ame &s;pecies, becau&s;e they produce fertile individuals; but, as the hor&s;e and a&s;s pro|duce only unfertile and vitiated individuals, they are evidently of different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It is in the characteri&s;tic diver&s;ities of &s;pecies, therefore, that the intervals in the &s;hades of na|ture are mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly marked. We may even affirm, that the&s;e intervals between diffe|rent &s;pecies are the mo&s;t equal and con&s;tant, &s;ince we can draw a line of &s;eparation between two &s;pecies, that is, between two &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of individuals who reproduce, but cannot mix; and, as we can al&s;o unite into one &s;pecies two &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of individuals who reproduce by mixing. This is the mo&s;t fixed and determined point in the hi&s;tory of nature. All other &s;imi|larities and differences which can be found in the compari&s;on of beings, are neither &s;o real nor &s;o con&s;tant. The&s;e intervals are the only lines of &s;eparation which &s;hall be followed in this work. We &s;hall introduce no artificial or arbi|trary divi&s;ions. Every &s;pecies, every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of individuals, who reproduce and cannot mix, &s;hall be con&s;idered and treated &s;eparately; and we &s;hall employ no other families, genera, or|ders, and cla&s;&s;es, than what are exhibited by Nature her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="413"> Species being thus confined to a con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of individuals endowed with the power of reproduction, it is obvious that this term ought never to be extended beyond animals and vege|tables, and that tho&s;e nomenclators who have employed it to di&s;tingui&s;h the different kinds of minerals have abu&s;ed terms and confounded ideas. We &s;hould not, therefore, con&s;ider iron as one &s;pecies, and lead as another &s;pecies: They ought only to be regarded as two different metals, and &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by lines of &s;eparation very different from tho&s;e employed in the di|&s;tinctions of animals or vegetables.</P>
<P>But to return to the degeneration of beings, and particularly to that of animals. Let us ex|amine more clo&s;ely the proceedings of Nature in the varieties &s;he offers to our con&s;ideration: And, as we are be&s;t acquainted with the human &s;pe|cies, let us ob&s;erve how far the varieties of it extend. Among men, all the gradations of co|lour, from black to white, are exhibited: They likewi&s;e differ, by one half, in height of &s;tature, thickne&s;s, &s;trength, &s;wiftne&s;s, &amp;c. But their mind is always the &s;ame. This latter quality, however, belongs not to matter, and ought not to be treated of in this place. The others are the common variations of Nature effected by the influence of climate and of food. But the&s;e dif|ferences in colour and dimen&s;ions prevent not the Negro and White, the Laplander and Pata|gonian, the giant and dwarf, from mixing toge|ther <PB N="408" REF="414"> and producing fertile individuals; and, con&s;equently, the&s;e men, &s;o different in appear|ance, are all of one &s;pecies, becau&s;e this uniform reproduction is the very circum&s;tance which con|&s;titutes di&s;tinct &s;pecies. Be&s;ide the&s;e general varieties, there are others of a more particular nature, and yet fail not to be perpetuated; as the enormous legs of <HI>the race of St Thomas</HI> in the i&s;land of Ceylon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. 2. under the article, <HI>Varieties of the human &s;pecies.</HI></NOTE>; the red eyes and white hair of the Dariens and Chacrelas; the &s;ix fin|gers and toes peculiar to certain families<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See this and other curious &s;ubjects relative to generation, &amp;c. in les lettres de M. de Maupertuis.</NOTE>, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;ingular varieties are accidental redun|dancies or defects, which, originating from &s;ome individuals, are propagated from generation to generation, like hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. But they ought not to be regarded as con&s;tituting parti|cular &s;pecies; &s;ince the&s;e uncommon races of men with gro&s;s limbs, or with &s;ix fingers, are capable of mixing and of producing fertile in|dividuals: The &s;ame remark is applicable to all other deformities which are communicated from parents to children.</P>
<P>Thus far only the errors of Nature and the varieties among men extend. If there are indi|viduals who degenerate &s;till farther, they pro|duce nothing, and change not the con&s;tancy and unity of the &s;pecies. Hence man con&s;titutes but one and the &s;ame &s;pecies; and, though this &s;pecies be, perhaps, the mo&s;t numerous, capri|cious, <PB N="409" REF="415"> and irregular in its actions; yet all the diver&s;ities in movement, food, climate, and other combinations which may be conceived, have not produced beings &s;o different from each other as to con&s;titute new &s;pecies, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;imilar to our&s;elves as to be con&s;idered as be|longing to us.</P>
<P>If the Negro and the White could not propa|gate, or if their productions remained barren, they would form two di&s;tinct &s;pecies; the Ne|gro would be to man what the a&s;s is to the hor&s;e; or, rather, if the White were man, the Negro would be a &s;eparate animal, like the mon|key; and we would be entitled to pronounce that the White and the Negro had not a common origin. But this &s;uppo&s;ition is contradicted by experience; for, as all the varieties of men are capable of mixing together, and of tran&s;initting the kind, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;prung from the &s;ame &s;tock or family.</P>
<P>A &s;light di&s;parity of temperament, or &s;ome accidental defect in the organs of generation, will render two individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies barren. A certain degree of conformity in the &s;tructure of the body, and in the organs of ge|neration, will enable two animals, of different &s;pecies, to produce individuals, &s;imilar to none of the parents, re&s;embling nothing fixed or per|manent; and, therefore, incapable of producing. But, what an amazing number of combinations are included in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that two ani|mals, <PB N="410" REF="416"> a male and a female, of a particular &s;pe|cies, &s;hould degenerate &s;o much as to form a new &s;pecies, and to lo&s;e the faculty of producing with any other of the kind but them&s;elves? It is &s;till more incredible that the offspring of &s;uch degenerated creatures &s;hould follow exactly the &s;ame laws which are ob&s;erved in the procreation of perfect animals: For a degenerated animal is a vitiated production; and how &s;hould an ori|gin that is vitiated, depraved, and defective, con|&s;titute a new &s;tock, and not only give ri&s;e to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of permanent and di&s;tinct beings, but even to produce them in the &s;ame manner, and according to the &s;ame laws which regulate the propagation of animals who&s;e race is pure and uncorrupted?</P>
<P>Though, therefore, we cannot demon&s;trate, that the formation of a new &s;pecies, by means of degeneration, exceeds the powers of Nature; yet the number of improbabilities attending &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, renders it totally incredible: For, if one &s;pecies could be produced by the degene|ration of another, if the a&s;s actually originated from the hor&s;e, this metamorpho&s;is could only have been effected by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t imperceptible degrees. Between the hor&s;e and a&s;s, there mu&s;t have been many intermediate a|nimals, the fir&s;t of which would gradually recede from the nature and qualities of the hor&s;e, and the la&s;t would make equal advances to tho&s;e of the a&s;s. What is become of the&s;e intermediate be|ings? <PB N="411" REF="417"> Why are their repre&s;entatives and de&s;cen|dants now extingui&s;hed? Why &s;hould the two extremes alone exi&s;t?</P>
<P>We may, therefore, without he&s;itation, pro|nounce the a&s;s to be an <HI>A&s;s,</HI> and not a degene|rated hor&s;e, a hor&s;e with a naked tail. The a&s;s is not a marvellous production. He is neither an intruder nor a ba&s;tard. Like all other ani|mals, his family, his &s;pecies, and his rank, are a&s;certained and peculiar to him&s;elf. His blood is pure and untainted: And, though his race be le&s;s noble and illu&s;trious, it is equally unalloyed, and as antient as that of the hor&s;e. Why, then, &s;hould an animal &s;o good, &s;o patient, &s;o tempe|rate, and &s;o u&s;eful, be treated with the mo&s;t &s;o|vereign contempt? Do men de&s;pi&s;e, even in the brute-creation, tho&s;e who &s;erve them be&s;t, and at the lea&s;t expence? The hor&s;e we educate with great care; we dre&s;s, attend, in&s;truct, and exerci&s;e him: While the poor a&s;s, abandon|ed to the brutality of the meane&s;t &s;ervants, or to the malicious abu&s;e of children, in&s;tead of ac|quiring, is rendered more &s;tupid and indocile, by the education he receives. If he had not a great &s;tock of good qualities, they would nece&s;|&s;arily be obliterated by the manner in which he is treated. He is the &s;port and pa&s;time of ru|&s;ticks, who conduct him with a rod, who beat, overload, and abu&s;e him, without precaution or management. We con&s;ider not, that, if the hor&s;e had no exi&s;tence, the a&s;s, both in him&s;elf and with regard to us, would be the fir&s;t, hand|&s;ome&s;t, <PB N="412" REF="418"> mo&s;t beautiful, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed animal in the creation. He holds, however, only the &s;econd, in&s;tead of the fir&s;t rank; and, for that rea&s;on, he is neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed. It is compari&s;on alone that degrades him. We view and judge of him, not as he is, but in com|pari&s;on with the hor&s;e. We forget that he is an a&s;s, that he has all the qualities and endow|ments peculiar to his &s;pecies; and we contem|plate the figure and qualities of the hor&s;e, which the a&s;s neither has, nor ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>In his di&s;po&s;ition, the a&s;s is equally humble, patient, and tranquil, as the hor&s;e is proud, ar|dent, and impetuous&punc; Cha&s;ti&s;ement and blows he endures with con&s;tancy, and perhaps with courage. He is temperate both as to the quan|tity and quality of his food. He eats content|edly the harde&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable herbage, which the hor&s;e and other animals pa&s;s by and di&s;dain. With regard to water, he is extremely nice. He drinks only from the cleare&s;t brooks he can find. In drinking, he is equally mode|rate as in eating. He never &s;inks his no&s;e in the water, being afraid, as has been alledged, of the &s;hadow of his ears<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cardan de &s;ubtilitate, lib. 10.</NOTE>. As no body takes the trouble of combing him, he often rolls on the gra&s;s, among thi&s;tles or ferns. Without paying any regard to the load he carries, he lies down and rolls as often as he can, &s;eemingly with &agrave; view to reproach the neglect of his ma&s;ter; for he <PB N="413" REF="419"> never wallows, like the hor&s;e, in the mire or in water. He is even afraid of wetting his feet, and turns off the road to avoid a puddle. His legs are al&s;o drier and cleaner than tho&s;e of the hor&s;e. He is &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of education, as to be &s;ometimes exhibited in public &s;hews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. de quadruped. &s;olidiped. lib. 1. p. 308.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The a&s;s, when young, is gay, hand&s;ome, nimble, and even graceful. But, whether from age or maletreatment, he &s;oon lo&s;es the&s;e qualities, and becomes &s;luggi&s;h, untractable, and &s;tubborn. He di&s;covers no ardour but in love. When under the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion, he is &s;o furious that nothing can re&s;train him; and, by exce&s;&s;ive in|dulgence, he &s;ometimes dies &s;oon after gratifi|cation. As his love ri&s;es to a degree of mad|ne&s;s, his attachment to his progeny is likewi&s;e exce&s;&s;ive. We are told by Pliny, that when the young is &s;eparated from the mother, &s;he will pa&s;s through flames to rejoin it. Though com|monly abu&s;ed, the a&s;s has a great affection for his ma&s;ter, whom he &s;cents at a di&s;tance, and di&s;tingui&s;hes him from every other per&s;on. He knows likewi&s;e the places where his ma&s;ter puts up, and the roads which he frequents. His eyes are exceedingly good; his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is admirable, e&s;pecially when in que&s;t of a female. His ear is excellent, which has contributed to make him be ranked among the timid animals, who are all &s;aid to have long ears and acute hearing. When oppre&s;&s;ed with too great a load, <PB N="414" REF="420"> he di&s;covers his unea&s;ine&s;s by inclining his head, and lowering his ears. When tormented by a|bu&s;e, he opens his mouth and draws back his lips in a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable manner, which gives him an air of &s;corn and deri&s;ion. If his eyes be covered, he &s;tands immoveably &s;till; and, when lying on one &s;ide, if the one eye re&s;ts on the ground, and the other be covered with a &s;tone or any other opaque body, he will continue in that &s;ituation, without making the &s;malle&s;t effort to ri&s;e. He walks, trots, and gallops like the hor&s;e: But all his movements are &s;lower and more circum&s;cribed. Though he can run, when he fir&s;t &s;ets out, with confiderable &s;wiftne&s;s, he only continues his career for a &s;hort time; and, whatever pace he a&s;&s;umes, if pu&s;hed hard, he is &s;oon fatigued.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e neighs; but the a&s;s brays: The la&s;t is performed by a very loud, long, di&s;agree|able, di&s;cordant cry, con&s;i&s;ting of di&s;cords alter|nately &s;harp and flat. He &s;eldom brays but when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger or love. The voice of the female is more clear and piercing than that of the male. When gelded, the a&s;s brays with a low voice; and, though he makes the &s;ame efforts and the &s;ame motions of the throat, yet the &s;ound reaches to no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupeds, the a&s;s is lea&s;t infe&s;ted with lice or other vermin, which &s;eems to be owing to the &s;uperior hardne&s;s and dryne&s;s of his &s;kin. <PB N="415" REF="421"> For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he is le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to the whip, or the &s;tinging of flies, than the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>At the age of two years and a half, the fir&s;t middle cutting teeth fall out, and the others on each &s;ide &s;oon follow. They are replaced in the &s;ame time and in the &s;ame order as tho&s;e of the hor&s;e. The age of the a&s;s is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hable, as in the hor&s;e, by the &s;ame marks in the teeth.</P>
<P>The a&s;s, when too years and a half old, is ca|pable of procreating. The female is &s;till more early, and equally la&s;civious, which la&s;t is a&s;|&s;igned as the rea&s;on for her want of fecundity. She rejects the cau&s;e of conception, unle&s;s the ar|dour of her de&s;ire be repre&s;&s;ed by blows. With|out this precaution, &s;he is &s;eldom impregnated. The ordinary &s;ea&s;on of love is the months of May and June. When pregnant, &s;he &s;oon becomes cool; and, in the eighth month, the milk appears in her paps. In the twelfth month, &s;he brings forth; and &s;olid ma&s;&s;es are often found in the liquor of the amnios, &s;imilar to the hippomanes of the foal. Seven days after deli|very, her ardour returns, and &s;he is in a condition to receive the male. Thus the female a&s;s may be &s;aid to be capable of perpetually nouri&s;hing and engendering. She produces but one colt; and there are very few examples of her bring|ing forth two at a time. At the end of five or &s;ix months, the colt may be weaned, e&s;pecially if the mother be pregnant, to enable her to af|ford proper nouri&s;hment to the foetus. The <PB N="416" REF="422"> jack-a&s;s &s;hould be cho&s;en from the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of his &s;pecies. He &s;hould be at lea&s;t three years of age, and &s;hould never exceed ten. He &s;hould have long limbs, a &s;trong body, an elevated and &s;mall head, vivacious eyes, large no&s;trils and che&s;t, fle&s;hy loins, broad ribs, flat buttocks, a &s;hort tail, and &s;hining, &s;oft hair of a deep gray colour.</P>
<P>The a&s;s, like the hor&s;e, takes three or four years before he arrives at full maturity; and, of cour&s;e, he lives to the age of 25 or 30 years. The females are &s;aid to live longer than the males. But this circum&s;tance is probably owing to the females being often pregnant, and more humanely treated; while the males are perpe|tually per&s;ecuted with blows and exce&s;&s;ive la|bour. They &s;leep le&s;s than the hor&s;e, and never lie down to &s;leep but after va&s;t fatigue. The jack-a&s;s lives longer than the &s;tallion. The ar|dour of the former increa&s;es with his years; and, in general, the health of this animal is more permanent and e&s;tabli&s;hed than that of the hor&s;e. The a&s;s is le&s;s delicate, and &s;ubject to much fewer di&s;tempers. The antients mention no other di&s;ea&s;e of the a&s;s but the glanders, to which, as formerly remarked, he is &s;till le&s;s liable than the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Of a&s;&s;es there are different races, as well as of hor&s;es: But they are not equally known; be|cau&s;e they have neither been taken care of nor traced with the &s;ame attention. It cannot, how|ever, <PB N="417" REF="423"> admit of a doubt, that they all originated from warm climates. Ari&s;totle a&s;&s;ures us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De generat. animal. lib. 11.</NOTE>, that, in his time, there were no a&s;&s;es in Scythia, or other northern nations, nor even in France, the climate of which, he remarks, was too cold: He adds, that cold climates either render them barren, or make them degenerate, which is the rea&s;on why they are &s;mall and feeble in Illyrica, Thracia, and Epirus. They are &s;till &s;o in France, though they have been long naturalized, and though, within the&s;e two thou&s;and years, the cold of the climate has been greatly dimini&s;hed by the cutting down of va&s;t fore&s;ts, and the draining of mar&s;hes. But it is more certain, that they have not long re&s;ided in Sweden and other northern countries<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Linnaei Faun. Suec.</NOTE>. They appear to have come originally from Arabia, and to have pa&s;&s;ed from Arabia to Egypt, from Egypt to Greece, from Greece to Italy, from Italy to France, and from thence to Germany, Britain, Sweden, &amp;c.; for it is a known fact, that they are weak and &s;mall in proportion to the coldne&s;s of the cli|mate.</P>
<P>This migration appears to be well &s;upported by the relations of travellers. Chardin remarks, 
<Q>'That there are two kinds of a&s;&s;es in Per&s;ia, one of which is &s;low and heavy, and u&s;ed only for carrying burdens; the other race come from Arabia, and are the hand&s;ome&s;t and fine&s;t <PB N="418" REF="424"> a&s;&s;es in the world. They have a glo&s;&s;y &s;kin, a high head, and nimble limbs: They move well, and are employed only for riding. The &s;addles which are put upon them re&s;emble round pannels, flattened above. They are made of woolen cloth, or of tape&s;try, with trappings and &s;tirrups. The rider &s;its nearer the crupper than the neck. Some of the&s;e a&s;&s;es co&s;t 400 livres, and they cannot be had for le&s;s than 25 pi&s;toles. They are dre&s;&s;ed like hor&s;es, and are never learned any motion but that of pacing. The art of training them con&s;i&s;ts of tying each fore-foot to the hind foot of the &s;ame &s;ide with two cords, which are made of the length that the a&s;s is to pace, and are &s;u&s;pended by another cord pa&s;&s;ed un|der the girth to the &s;tirrup-leather. They are exerci&s;ed by grooms, every morning and evening, to this kind of motion. Their no&s;es are &s;lit, to make them breathe more freely; and they go &s;o quick, that a hor&s;e mu&s;t gal|lop in order to keep up with them.'</Q></P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that the Arabians, who pre&s;erve with &s;o much care, and for &s;o long a time, the races of their hor&s;es, would pay equal attention to their a&s;&s;es: From the above pa&s;&s;age, and other &s;ources of information, however, it appears, that Arabia is the original and be&s;t cli|mate for both animals. From Arabia the a&s;&s;es pa&s;&s;ed into Barbary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's travels.</NOTE> and Egypt, where they <PB N="419" REF="425"> are large and hand&s;ome. In India and Guiney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le voyage de Guin&eacute;e de Bo&s;man, p. 239.</NOTE>, they are larger, &s;tronger, and more u&s;eful than the hor&s;es of the&s;e countries. They are in high e&s;timation at Madura<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lettres edifiantes, douzieme recueil, p. 96.</NOTE>, where one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable tribes of Indians revere them in a peculiar manner, becau&s;e they believe that the &s;ouls of all the nobility pa&s;s into the bodies of a&s;&s;es. La&s;tly, the number of a&s;&s;es exceeds that of hor&s;es in all the &s;outhern regions from Sene|gal to China. Wild a&s;&s;es are likewi&s;e more common than wild hor&s;es. The Latins, copy|ing the Greeks, called the wild a&s;s <HI>onager,</HI> which &s;hould not be confounded, as mo&s;t naturali&s;ts and travellers have done, with the zebra, becau&s;e the zebra is an animal of a different &s;pecies from that of the a&s;s. The onager, or wild a&s;s, is not &s;triped like the zebra, and is not nearly of &s;o e|legant a figure. Wild a&s;&s;es are found in &s;ome of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and particularly in that of Cerigo<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dapper's collection, p. 185.</NOTE>. There are many of them in the de&s;erts of Lybia and Numidia<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lconis A&s;ric. de Afric. de&s;cript. tom. 2. p. 52. et l'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 53.</NOTE>. They are gray, and run &s;o fleet, that they can only be overtaken in the chace by the be&s;t Barbary hor|&s;es. When they &s;ee a man, they give a loud cry, fling up their heels, &s;top, and fly not till he makes a near approach. They are caught in &s;nares and gins made of ropes. They pa&s;ture <PB N="420" REF="426"> in troops; and their fle&s;h is eaten by the natives. In the days of Marmol, there were wild a&s;&s;es in Sardinia; but they were &s;maller than tho&s;e of Africa; and Pietro della Valle &s;ays, that he &s;aw a wild a&s;s in Ba&s;&s;ora<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Pietre della Valle, tom. 8. p. 49.</NOTE>. He differed not in fi|gure from the dome&s;tic a&s;s, only his colour was clearer, and he had, from the head to the tail, a line of white hair. He was al&s;o more vivacious and &s;wift than common a&s;&s;es. Olearius relates<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Adam Olearius, tom. 1. p. 511.</NOTE>, that one day the King of Per&s;ia invited him to the top of a &s;mall building, in form of a theatre, to partake of a collation of fruits and &s;weat-meats; that, after the repast, thirty-two wild a&s;&s;es were introduced; that the King amu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;hooting a few bullets and arrows at them; that he then allowed the &s;ame privilege to &s;ome of the nobility and amba&s;&s;adors; that it was no &s;mall entertainment to &s;ee the&s;e a&s;&s;es running about, biting, and kicking each other, with &s;e|veral arrows &s;ticking in their bodies; and that, when the whole were killed in pre&s;ence of the King, they were &s;ent to I&s;pahan for the royal family, the Per&s;ians being extremely fond of a&s;s's fle&s;h, &amp;c. It does not appear, however, that all the&s;e 32 wild a&s;&s;es were taken in the fore&s;ts: It is more probable that they were brought up in large parks for the plea&s;ure of chacing and eating them.</P>
<P>Neither a&s;&s;es nor hor&s;es were found in Ame|rica, though the climate of South America is <PB N="421" REF="427"> very agreeable to their nature. Tho&s;e tran&s;port|ed thither by the Spaniards, and left in large i&s;lands, or in the continent, have multiplied ex|ceedingly. They pa&s;ture in troops, and are ta|ken by &s;nares, like the wild hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The jack-a&s;s and mare produce the large mules; and the hor&s;e and &s;he-a&s;s produce the &s;maller mules, which differ, in &s;everal re&s;pects, from the former. But, as we mean to treat of the generation of mules, jumars, &amp;c. in a &s;e|parate di&s;&s;ertation, we &s;hall fini&s;h the hi&s;tory of the a&s;s with the u&s;es men derive from this ani|mal.</P>
<P>Wild a&s;&s;es being unknown in our climates, we cannot determine whether their fle&s;h makes a whole&s;ome or &s;avoury di&s;h. But this we know, that the fle&s;h of the dome&s;tic a&s;s is wor&s;e, hard|er, and more di&s;agreeably in&s;ipid than that of the hor&s;e. Galen &s;ays, that it is a pernicious a|liment, and produces di&s;ea&s;es. The milk of the a&s;s, on the contrary, is an approven remedy and &s;pecific again&s;t certain di&s;tempers. The u&s;e of this remedy has been tran&s;mitted to us by the Greeks. To have good milk, the &s;he-a&s;s &s;hould be young, healthy, and plump, not long after delivery, and uncovered; the colt &s;hould be ta|ken from her; &s;he ought to be kept by her&s;elf, and fed with hay, oats, barley, and &s;uch &s;alu|tary herbs as may have an influence on the ma|lady. The milk &s;hould never be allowed to <PB N="422" REF="428"> cool, nor even be expo&s;ed to the air, which in|jures it in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>As the &s;kin of the a&s;s is very hard and ela&s;tic, it is applied to many different u&s;es. It is em|ployed for making &s;ieves, drums, &s;hoes, and poc|ket-book parchment, which is laid over with a &s;light coat of pla&s;ter. The a&s;s &s;kin is likewi&s;e u&s;ed by the ea&s;tern nations for making their &s;a|gri or chagrin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 2. p. 64.</NOTE>. It is al&s;o probable, that the bones of the a&s;s are harder than tho&s;e of other animals, &s;ince the antients preferred it for ma|king their be&s;t &s;ounding flutes.</P>
<P>In proportion to his &s;ize, the a&s;s can carry more weight than any other animal. As he is fed at very little expence, and requires hardly any care, he is of great u&s;e for different kinds of country-bu&s;ine&s;s. He may likewi&s;e be u&s;ed for riding: All his motions are &s;oft, and he is not &s;o apt to &s;tumble as the hor&s;e. In countries where the land is light, he is often yoked in the plough; and his dung, in &s;trong moi&s;t land, is an excellent manure.</P>

<P>THE &s;urface of the earth, adorned with its verdure, is the common and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource, from which man and other animals derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every animated being in na|ture is nouri&s;hed by vegetables; and the&s;e, in their turn, are &s;upported by the &s;poils of all that has lived or vegetated. De&s;truction is nece&s;&s;a|ry to life: It is only by the de&s;truction of beings, that animals can live and multiply. God, when <PB N="424" REF="431"> he created the fir&s;t individuals of each &s;pecies of animal and vegetable, not only be&s;towed form on the du&s;t of the earth, but gave it animation, by infu&s;ing into tho&s;e individuals a greater or &s;maller quantity of active principles, of living organic particles, which are inde&s;tructible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chap. VI. &amp;c. of the &s;econd volume of this work.</NOTE>, and common to every organized being. The&s;e par|ticles pa&s;s from body to body, and are equally the cau&s;es of life, of the continuation of the &s;pe|cies, of growth, and of nutrition. After the di&s;&s;olution of the body, after it is reduced to a&s;hes, tho&s;e organic particles, upon which death has no influence, &s;urvive, circulate through the univer&s;e, pa&s;s into other beings, and produce life and nouri&s;hment. Hence, every production, every renovation or increa&s;e by means of gene|ration, of nutrition, or of growth, implies a pre|ceding de&s;truction, a conver&s;ion of &s;ub&s;tance, a tran&s;lation of organic particles, which never multiply, but, uniformly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in equal numbers, render Nature always equally anima|ted, the earth equally peopled, and equally re|&s;plendent with the original glory of that Being by whom it was created.</P>
<P>Taking beings in general, therefore, the total quantity of life remains always the &s;ame; and death, which &s;eems to be an univer&s;al de&s;troyer, annihilates no part of that primitive life which is common to all organized bodies. Like all <PB N="425" REF="432"> &s;ubordinate powers, Death attacks individuals only. His blows are confined to the &s;urface: He destroys the form, but has no influence on the matter. He is unable to injure Nature; his &s;trokes, on the contrary, make her &s;hine with additional lu&s;tre. She permits him not to annihilate the &s;pecies, but allows him, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly, to mow down individuals, with a view to demon&s;trate her independence both of Death and of Time, to give her an opportunity of exert|ing, at every in&s;tant, her power, which is al|ways active, and of manife&s;ting the extent of her re&s;ources, by her fertility, and, by a perpe|tual renovation of beings, to make the univer&s;e a theatre always filled with objects which attract our attention by their grandeur and their novel|ty.</P>
<P>It is apparent, therefore, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beings cannot otherwi&s;e be effected than by mu|tual de&s;truction. For the nouri&s;hment and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of animals, vegetables or other animals mu&s;t be &s;acrificed: And as, both before and af|ter this de&s;truction, the quantity of life remains always the &s;ame, Nature &s;eems to be indifferent whether particular &s;pecies be more or le&s;s con|&s;umed. Like an oeconomical parent, however, in the mid&s;t of fulne&s;s and affluence, &s;he fixes limits to her expence, and prevents any unne|ce&s;&s;ary wa&s;te, by be&s;towing on few animals the in&s;tinct of feeding on fle&s;h, while &s;he has mul|tiplied, profu&s;ely, both the &s;pecies and the indi|viduals <PB N="426" REF="433"> of tho&s;e which live upon plants. In the vegetable kingdom, &s;he &s;eems even to be prodi|gal of &s;pecies, which are every where diffu&s;ed, and endowed with an a&s;toni&s;hing fecundity. Man, it is probable, has contributed not a little to promote the intentions of Nature, by main|taining, and even e&s;tabli&s;hing, this order upon the earth; for, in the ocean, we actually per|ceive that indifference which we have &s;uppo&s;ed. Fi&s;hes of every kind are almo&s;t equally voraci|ous. They live upon their own or different &s;pecies, and perpetually devour each other, with|out annihilating any particular kind; becau&s;e their &s;ecundity is proportioned to the depreda|tions they commit, and the whole con&s;umption reverts to the advantage of reproduction.</P>
<P>Man knows how to exerci&s;e his power over animals. He &s;elects tho&s;e who&s;e fle&s;h is mo&s;t agreeable to his palate, makes them his dome&s;tic &s;laves, and multiplies them far beyond what Na|ture would have done. By his indu&s;try in pro|moting their increa&s;e, he &s;eems to have acquired a right to &s;acrifice them. But he extends this right farther than his nece&s;&s;ities demand. He makes war again&s;t &s;avage animals, birds, and fi&s;hes. He does not even limit him&s;elf to tho&s;e of the climate he inhabits, but goes to foreign nations, and to the mid&s;t of the ocean, in que&s;t of new luxuries. All Nature &s;eems to be in&s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy the intemperance and caprice of his appetite. Man alone con&s;umes more fle&s;h <PB N="427" REF="434"> than all the other carnivorous animals in the world. He is unque&s;tionably the greate&s;t de|&s;troyer; and he is &s;o, more from abu&s;e than ne|ce&s;&s;ity. In&s;tead of enjoying, with moderation, the benefits pre&s;ented to him, in&s;tead of di&s;pen|&s;ing them with equity, or making reparation in proportion to his wa&s;te, by renewing what he annihilates, the rich man places his chief glory in con&s;uming at table more in one day than would be &s;ufficient to feed many families. His abu&s;e is not confined to the animals, but extends to his fellow-men, many of whom langui&s;h with famine and mi&s;ery, and labour only to &s;atiate the vanity and luxurious appetite of the opulent, who kill the poor by want, and put an end to their own exi&s;tence by exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Man, notwith&s;tanding, like &s;ome other ani|mals, might live upon vegetables. Fle&s;h, which appears &s;o analogous to fle&s;h, affords not better nouri&s;hment than grain or bread. That nutri|ment which contributes to the expan&s;ion, growth, and &s;upport of the body, con&s;i&s;ts not of the in|ert and vi&s;ible matter of which the texture of fle&s;h and of herbs is compo&s;ed, but of the orga|nic particles contained in both the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances; for the ox, in brow&s;ing the herbage, acquires as much fle&s;h as man, or other animals, who live entirely on carnage and blood. There is but one difference between the&s;e two kinds of ali|ment: When the quantities are equal, fle&s;h, corn, and &s;eeds, contain a greater number of <PB N="428" REF="435"> organic particles than herbage, or the leaves, roots, and other parts of plants. Of this fact we are a&s;certained by examining infu&s;ions of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances: So that man, and the other carnivorous animals, who&s;e &s;tomachs and inte|&s;tines are not &s;o capacious as to admit a great deal of aliment at a time, are unable to devour herbage in quantities &s;ufficient to afford the num|ber of organic particles nece&s;&s;ary for nouri&s;hing them. It is for this rea&s;on, that man, and the other animals who have but one &s;tomach, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t only upon fle&s;h and &s;eeds, which contain, in a &s;mall volume, a great number of the&s;e or|ganic nutritive particles: While the ox, and o|ther ruminant animals, who have &s;everal &s;to|machs, one of which is remarkably capacious, and, con&s;equently, can admit a large quantity of herbage, are enabled to extract from this ma&s;s a number of organic particles &s;ufficient for their nouri&s;hment, growth, and multiplication. Here the quantity compen&s;ates the quality of the nutriment. But the &s;tock is the &s;ame. It is the &s;ame matter, the &s;ame organic particles, which nouri&s;h man, the ox, and all other animals.</P>
<P>It will be objected, that the hor&s;e has but one &s;tomach, and a very &s;mall one; that the a&s;s, the hare, and other animals which live upon herbs, have likewi&s;e but one &s;tomach; and, con&s;e|quently, that this theory, however probable, is not well founded. The&s;e apparent exceptions, however, &s;o far from weakening, &s;eem to con|firm <PB N="429" REF="436"> the truth of it: For, though the hor&s;e and the a&s;s have but one &s;tomach, they have &s;acs or pouches in their inte&s;tines, &s;o large, that they may be compared to the paunch of ruminant a|nimals; and hares have a blind gut &s;o long and wide, that it is equivalent, at lea&s;t, to a &s;econd &s;tomach. Thus, it is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing, that the&s;e animals are properly nouri&s;hed by herbage alone: And, in general, it will always hold, that the different modes of feeding among animals depend on the total capacity of their &s;tomach and inte&s;tines: For ruminating ani|mals, as the ox, the &s;heep, the camel, &amp;c. have four &s;tomachs, and inte&s;tines of a prodigious length; and herbage alone is &s;ufficient nouri&s;h|ment for them. Hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, hares, rabbits, Guiney-pigs, &amp;c. have only one &s;tomach; but they have a blind gut equivalent to a &s;econd &s;tomach; and they feed upon herbage and grain. The wild boar, the hedge-hog, the &s;quirrel, &amp;c. who&s;e &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are of a mean ca|pacity, eat little herbage, but principally live upon &s;eeds, fruits, and roots: And tho&s;e animals which, in proportion to the &s;ize of their bodies, have &s;mall &s;tomachs and inte&s;tines, as the wolf, the fox, the tiger, &amp;c. are obliged to choo&s;e food of the mo&s;t &s;ucculent kind, and which contains the greate&s;t number of organic particles, and, of cour&s;e, to live upon fle&s;h, blood, &s;eeds, and fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="437"> It is obvious, therefore, that the diver&s;ity of ta&s;tes perceived in the appetites of different ani|mals, ari&s;es not from the &s;uperior agreeablene&s;s of particular kinds of food to their palates, but from a phy&s;ical cau&s;e nece&s;&s;arily depending on the &s;tructure of their bodies: For, if they were not oftener determined by nece&s;&s;ity, than by ta&s;te, how could they devour corrupted carrion with equal avidity as fre&s;h and &s;ucculent fle&s;h? Why &s;hould they eat, without di&s;tinction, every &s;pecies of fle&s;h? We &s;ee, that dome&s;tic dogs, who have the liberty of making a choice, con|&s;tantly refu&s;e certain meats, as pork, woodcocks, thru&s;hes, &amp;c. But wild dogs, wolves, foxes, &amp;c. eat, indi&s;criminately, the fle&s;h of &s;wine, woodcocks, birds of every kind, and even frogs; for I once found two frogs in the &s;tomach of a wolf. When they can procure neither fle&s;h nor fi&s;h, they eat fruits, &s;eeds, grapes, &amp;c. But they uniformly prefer tho&s;e kinds of food which, in a &s;mall volume, contain a great quantity of nu|triment, or rather of organic particles, proper for nouri&s;hing and &s;upporting their bodies.</P>
<P>If the&s;e proofs &s;hould not appear to be &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong, let us attend to the manner of feeding cattle, when the object is to fatten them. They are fir&s;t ca&s;trated, which ob&s;tructs the pa&s;&s;age through which the greate&s;t quantity of organic particles e&s;cape. Then, in&s;tead of allowing them to feed, as u&s;ual, on herbage alone, they are &s;erved with bran, corn, turnips, and, in a <PB N="431" REF="438"> word, with food more &s;ub&s;tantial than gra&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No food fattens cattle &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully or &s;o quickly as green herbage; but turnips, and the dry kinds of nouri&s;hment men|tioned in the text, are u&s;ed only in winter, when green vege|tables cannot be procured in &s;ufficient quantities.</NOTE>. The quantity of fle&s;h, juices, and fat, &s;oon aug|ment; and, from a fle&s;h naturally hard and dry, good and &s;ucculent meat is produced, which is u&s;ed as the ba&s;is of our be&s;t di&s;hes.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, it is likewi&s;e a con&s;equence, that man, who&s;e &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines are proportionally of no great capacity, could not live upon herbage alone. It is an in|conte&s;tible fact, however, that he can live pretty well upon bread, herbs, and the &s;eeds of plants; for we know whole nations, and particular or|ders of men, who are prohibited by their reli|gion from eating any animal &s;ub&s;tance. But the&s;e examples, though &s;upported by the autho|rity of Pythagoras, and recommended by &s;ome phy&s;icians, appear in&s;ufficient to convince us, that the health and multiplication of mankind would be improved by feeding &s;olely upon pot|herbs and bread; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that the country-people, whom the luxury and &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of the opulent reduce to this mode of living, langui&s;h and die much &s;ooner than men of the middle rank of life, who are equally &s;trangers to want and to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Next to man, the carnivorous animals are the greate&s;t de&s;troyers. They are at once the ene|mies <PB N="432" REF="439"> of Nature and the rivals of the human kind. A con&s;tant attention, joined to the mo&s;t indefa|tigable indu&s;try, are nece&s;&s;ary to protect our flocks, poultry, &amp;c. from birds of prey, and from the rapacious jaws of the wolf, fox, wea&s;el, mar|tin, &amp;c. A perpetual war is requi&s;ite to defend even our grain, fruits, and garments, again&s;t the voracious attacks of rats, caterpillars, beetles, mites, &amp;c.; for in&s;ects are to be ranked among tho&s;e animals which are more de&s;tructive than u&s;eful. But the ox, the &s;heep, and other herbi|vorous animals, are not only the mo&s;t precious and mo&s;t u&s;eful to man, but they con&s;ume le&s;s, and are maintained at the &s;malle&s;t expence. With regard to this article, the excellence of the ox is &s;uperior to that of any other creature; for he re&s;tores to the earth as much as he takes from it: He even enriches and improves the ground on which he feeds. The hor&s;e, on the con|trary, and mo&s;t other animals, impoveri&s;h, in a few years, the be&s;t pa&s;ture-lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It were to be wi&s;hed, that the author had &s;upported this a&s;&s;ertion by facts; for what he here advances, is not only doubt|ful, but probably altogether without foundation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only advantages which man derives from the ox. Without the aid of this u&s;eful animal, both the poor and the opu|lent would find great difficulty in procuring &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; the earth would remain uncultivated; our fields and gardens would become parched and barren. All the labour of the country de|pends <PB N="433" REF="440"> upon him. He is the mo&s;t advantageous dome&s;tic of the farmer. He is the very &s;ource and &s;upport of agriculture. Formerly the ox con&s;tituted the whole riches of mankind; and he is &s;till the ba&s;is of the riches of nations, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t and flouri&s;h in proportion only to the cul|tivation of their lands and the number of their cattle: For in the&s;e all real wealth con&s;i&s;ts; every other kind, even gold and &s;ilver, being only &s;ic|titious repre&s;entations, have no value, but what is conferred on them by the productions of the earth.</P>
<P>The form of the ox's back and loins &s;how that he is not equally qualified for carrying bur|dens as the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, or the camel. But the thickne&s;s of his neck, and broadne&s;s of &s;houlders, point him out as de&s;tined for the yoke. Though his chief &s;trength lies in his &s;houlders, yet, in many provinces of France, they oblige him to draw by the horns. In &s;upport of this practice, it is alledged, that, when yoked in this manner, he is more ea&s;ily managed. His head, I allow, is &s;o very &s;trong, that he may draw tolerably well by the horns; but &s;till he would draw with much more advantage if yoked by the &s;houlders. Nature &s;eems to have intended him for the plough. The largene&s;s of his body, the &s;low|ne&s;s of his movements, the &s;hortne&s;s of his legs, and even his tranquility and patience under la|bour, concur in rendering him &s;uperior to every other animal for cultivating the ground, and o|vercoming <PB N="434" REF="441"> that con&s;tant re&s;i&s;tance which the earth oppo&s;es to his efforts. The hor&s;e, though perhaps equal in &s;trength, is not &s;o well-fitted for this kind of labour. His limbs are too long, and his motions too &s;udden and violent. Be|&s;ides, he is impatient, and ea&s;ily di&s;heartened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hor&s;e, when properly trained, is equally firm and &s;teady at a con&s;tant draught as the ox, and much more capable of an extraordinary exertion, when that becomes nece&s;&s;ary. This quality gives him an evident &s;uperiority over the ox; becau&s;e it renders it unnece&s;&s;ary for the farmer to keep &s;upernumerary cattle for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of overcoming any violent re&s;i&s;tance that may occur.</NOTE>. When employed in this heavy work, which re|quires more per&s;everance than ardour, more force than quickne&s;s, and more weight than &s;pring, we rob the hor&s;e of all the nimblene&s;s of his motions, and all the graces of his gait and atti|tudes.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e animals which man forms into flocks, and who&s;e multiplication is his principal object, the females are more u&s;eful than the males. The produce of the cow is almo&s;t perpetually renew|ed. The fle&s;h of the calf is equally whole&s;ome and delicate; the milk is an excellent food, e|&s;pecially for children; butter is u&s;ed in mo&s;t of our di&s;hes; and chee&s;e is the principal nouri&s;h|ment of our pea&s;ants. How many poor fami|lies are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of living entirely on their cow? Tho&s;e very men, who toil from morning to night, who groan and are bowed down with the labour of ploughing the ground, obtain nothing from the earth but black bread, <PB N="435" REF="442"> and are obliged to yield to others the flour and &s;ub&s;tantial part of the grain. They rai&s;e rich crops, but not for them&s;elves. Tho&s;e men who breed and multiply our cattle, who &s;pend their whole lives in rearing and guarding them from injuries, are debarred from enjoying the fruits of their labour. They are denied the u&s;e of fle&s;h, and obliged, by their condition, or rather by the cruelty of the opulent, to live, like hor&s;es, upon barley, oats, coar&s;e pot-herbs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The cow may likewi&s;e be u&s;ed in ploughing; and, though her &s;trength is not equal to that of the <HI>ox,</HI> &s;he frequently &s;upplies his place. But, when employed in this way, &s;he &s;hould be matched, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, with an <HI>ox</HI> of the &s;ame &s;tature and &s;trength, or with another cow, in order to maintain the equality of the draught, and to keep the plough in equilibrium between the two forces, which facilitates the labour, and makes the furrows more regular. From &s;ix to eight oxen are often employed in &s;tiff land, and particularly in rough fallow-grounds, which ri&s;e in large ma&s;&s;es. But two cows are &s;ufficient for light &s;oils; and, in very light land, the length of the furrow drawn at once may be far|ther extended. The antients limited the length of the furrow, to be drawn without any inter|ruption in the motion of the cattle, to 120 paces; after which they were allowed to &s;top, for a few moments, to recover their breath, before going on with the &s;ame furrow, or beginning a <PB N="436" REF="443"> new one. But the antients delighted in the &s;tudy of agriculture, and gloried in ploughing them|&s;elves, or at lea&s;t in encouraging their labourers, and rendering both them and the cattle as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. Among the moderns, however, tho&s;e who enjoy the mo&s;t luxurious productions of the earth, are lea&s;t acquainted with the means of encouraging or &s;upporting the arts of culti|vation.</P>
<P>Propagation is the principal u&s;e of the bull. Though he may likewi&s;e be trained to labour; yet his obedience is uncertain, and it is always nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the improper exertions of his &s;trength. Nature has endowed the bull with a bold and untractable di&s;po&s;ition. In the rutting &s;ea&s;on, he becomes perfectly ungovern|able, and often furious. But ca&s;tration, while it de&s;troys the &s;ource of the&s;e impetuous emo|tions, dimini&s;hes not his &s;trength. On the contrary, it makes him larger, heavier, and more fit for the labour to which he is de&s;tined. It al&s;o changes his di&s;po&s;itions; for, after this o|peration, he becomes more tractable, more pa|tient, and le&s;s trouble&s;ome to his neighbours. A flock of bulls would exhibit a &s;cene of the mo&s;t frightful di&s;cord; they could neither be intimidated nor conducted by man.</P>
<P>The manner of performing ca&s;tration is well known to the country-people. Different modes, however, are practi&s;ed, and their effects are per|haps not properly attended to. In general, the <PB N="437" REF="444"> time mo&s;t proper for ca&s;tration, is that which immediately precedes puberty, which happens at the age of 18 months or two years. When performed more early, the animals &s;eldom &s;ur|vive

However, when young calves are ca|&s;trated &s;oon after birth, and &s;urvive an operation &s;o dangerous at that period of life, they become larger and fatter <HI>oxen,</HI> than if it had been de|layed till the &s;econd, third, or fourth year. But, in the latter ca&s;e, they pre&s;erve more of their na|tural activity and courage: And, when delayed till the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, or eight year, the animals hardly lo&s;e any of the qualities peculiar to the male &s;ex.

<P>The cow arrives at the age of puberty in eighteen months, and the bull in two years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this country, cows and bulls are capable of procrea|ting at a much earlier period,</NOTE>.

<P>In all quadrupeds, without exception, the voice of the male is &s;tronger and deeper than that of the female. Though the antients alledge, that the cow, the <HI>ox,</HI> and even the calf, have deeper voices than the bull; yet the contrary is certain; for the voice of the bull reaches much farther. The bellowing of the bull not being a &s;imple &s;ound, but compo&s;ed of two or three octaves, the highe&s;t of which &s;trikes the ear mo&s;t forcibly, may have given ri&s;e to this deception: But, when we li&s;ten attentively, we perceive, at the &s;ame time, a &s;ound much graver than is ut|tered by the cow, the <HI>ox,</HI> or the calf, who&s;e low|ings are al&s;o a great deal &s;horter. The bull never bellows, but when &s;timulated by love; the low|ings <PB N="443" REF="450"> of the cow proceed oftener from terror or timidity, than from any other cau&s;e; and pain, hunger, or the ab&s;ence of the mother, pro|duce the complaints of the calf.</P>
<P>The heavie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;luggi&s;h animals are not tho&s;e which &s;leep longe&s;t or mo&s;t profoundly. The &s;lumbers of the ox are &s;light and &s;hort. The &s;lighte&s;t noi&s;e rou&s;es him. He lies commonly on the left &s;ide; and the left kidney is always larger and fatter than the right.</P>
<P>The <HI>ox,</HI> like other dome&s;tic animals, varies in colour. The reddi&s;h colour, however, is mo&s;t common, and in highe&s;t e&s;timation. Some prai&s;e the black colour; and others maintain, that bay
<HI>oxen</HI> live longe&s;t; that the brown &s;oon decay and lo&s;e their &s;pirit; and that the gray, the dap|pled, and the white, are of no value for the pur|po&s;es of labour, and &s;hould only be fattened for &s;laughter. But, whatever be the colour of an <HI>ox,</HI> his coat ought to be &s;mooth, &s;hining, thick, and &s;oft to the touch; for, when rough and unequal, it indicates bad health, or a weak con&s;titution. A good <HI>ox</HI> for the plough &s;hould neither be too fat nor too lean; his head ought to be &s;hort, his ears large and well covered with hair, his horns &s;trong, &s;hining, and middle-&s;ized, his fore-head broad, his eyes large and black, his muzzle thick and flat, his no&s;trils wide, his teeth white and even, his lips black, his neck fle&s;hy and &s;trong, his &s;houlders thick and ma&s;&s;y, his che&s;t large, his dewlap long, and extending as far as <PB N="444" REF="451"> his knees, his loins very broad, his belly wide and prominent, his flanks large, his haunches long, his crupper thick, his legs and thighs large and nervous, his back &s;traight and plump, his tail as long as to reach the ground, and covered with fine bu&s;hy hair, his feet firm, his &s;kin thick and pliable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La nouvelle mai&s;on ru&s;tique, tom. 1. p. 279.</NOTE>, his mu&s;cles well rai&s;ed, and his toes or hoofs broad and &s;hort<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e marks are at pre&s;ent out of fa&s;hion in Britain, and not to be depended on.

But it is only by degrees, and by beginning at an early period, that the <HI>ox</HI> can be taught patiently to bear the yoke, and to allow him&s;elf to be con|ducted with ea&s;e. At the age of two and a half, or three years at mo&s;t, we &s;hould begin to tame and accu&s;tom him to the yoke. If longer de|layed, he often becomes perfectly ungovern|able. Patience, mildne&s;s, and even care&s;&s;es, are the only means which &s;hould be employed. Force and har&s;h treatment &s;erve no other pur|po&s;e than to di&s;pirit and render him totally un|manageable. He &s;hould be &s;troaked and care&s;|&s;ed; and he &s;hould occa&s;ionally be fed with boiled barley, brui&s;ed beans, and other aliments of the &s;ame kind, mixed with a little &s;alt, of all which he is extremely fond. His horns, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould be frequently tied. Some <PB N="445" REF="452"> days afterwards, he may be yoked to the plough along with another <HI>ox</HI> of the &s;ame &s;tature, which has been previou&s;ly trained. They &s;hould be tied up together at the manager, and led to the &s;ame pa&s;ture, in order to make them thoroughly acquainted, and acquire the habit of having al|ways the &s;ame movements. At fir&s;t the goad &s;hould never be u&s;ed; for it contributes to ren|der them untractable. He &s;hould be forced to work only a little at a time; for, when not thoroughly broke, he is &s;oon fatigued. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he &s;hould be fed more plentifully than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The <HI>ox</HI> ought to labour only from three to ten years; for, when he works till he be farther advanced in years, the quality of the beef is in|jured. The age of this animal is known by his teeth and horns. The middlemo&s;t fore-teeth fall out when he is ten months old, and are re|placed by others which are broader, but not &s;o white. At the age of &s;ixteen months, tho&s;e next to the former &s;hed, and are &s;ucceeded by others. At the age of four years, the whole cutting teeth are renewed; and they are then even, long, and pretty white. In proportion as the <HI>ox</HI> advances in years, the&s;e teeth wear and become black and unequal. The &s;ame thing happens to the bull and cow. Thus neither &s;ex nor ca&s;tration have any influence on the growth or &s;hedding of the teeth. Neither do the&s;e circum&s;tances produce any alteration in the ca&s;ting of the horns; for, <PB N="446" REF="453"> at the age of three years, the bull, cow, and <HI>ox,</HI> &s;hed their horns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black cattle, it is well known, never do <HI>&s;hed their horns.</HI> It is a&s;toni&s;hing that our learned author &s;hould have been be|trayed into this blunder, and &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing that it &s;hould be repeated in the la&s;t Paris edition, in 12mo. The rings he mentions do, indeed, begin to appear at this period, and con|tinue to increa&s;e, with &s;ome regularity, as long as the animal lives.</NOTE>, which are replaced by others, and which, like the &s;econd teeth, never fall off. The horns of the <HI>ox</HI> and cow are longer and thin|ner than tho&s;e of the bull. The growth of the &s;econd horns is not uniform. The fir&s;t year, which is the fourth of the animal's age, two neat pointed horns, terminated near the head by a kind of ring, ari&s;e. In the following year, this ring mounts farther from the head, being pu&s;hed forward by a new horny cylinder, which is likewi&s;e terminated by another ring, and &s;o on; for the horns continue to grow as long as the animal lives. The&s;e rings are very apparent; and, by their number, the ox's age may be ea&s;ily counted, by adding three years to the number of intervals between the rings.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e eats &s;lowly, but almo&s;t perpetually. The ox, on the contrary, eats fa&s;t, and fills his &s;tomach in a very &s;hort time; after which, he lics down to ruminate. This difference in eat|ing, proceeds from the different conformation of their &s;tomachs. The ox, who&s;e two fir&s;t &s;to|machs con&s;i&s;t of but one large bag, can, without <PB N="447" REF="454"> inconveniency, quickly throw in a great quan|tity of herbage, which, by means of chewing the cud, he dige&s;ts at lei&s;ure. But the &s;tomach of the hor&s;e, which is &s;ingle and &s;mall, can only receive a &s;mall quantity of food; and he, there|fore, fills it gradually, in proportion as the her|bage di&s;&s;olves, and pa&s;&s;es into the inte&s;tines, where the decompo&s;ition of the aliment is chiefly effec|ted. Having examined, in the ox and hor&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive product of dige&s;tion, particularly in the decompo&s;ition of hay, I remarked, in the ox, that, when the aliment was pa&s;&s;ing into that part of the paunch which forms the &s;econd &s;to|mach, it was reduced to a kind of green pa&s;te, re&s;embling boiled &s;pinage; that, under this form, it is retained in the folds of the third &s;tomach; that the decompo&s;ition is completed in the fourth &s;tomach; and that hardly any thing pa&s;&s;es into the inte&s;tines, excepting faeces or dregs. But, in the hor&s;e, the hay is not decompo&s;ed, either in the &s;tomach or fir&s;t portions of the inte&s;tines, where it only becomes more &s;oft and pliable, being ma|cerated by the liquor which &s;urrounds it. With very little alteration, it arrives at the caecum and colon. It is chiefly in the&s;e two inte&s;tines, who&s;e extraordinary capacity corre&s;ponds with that of the paunch of ruminant animals, that the food of hor&s;es is decompo&s;ed. But the decom|po&s;ition is never &s;o complete, as that which is ef|fected in the fourth &s;tomach of the ox.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="455"> For the&s;e rea&s;ons, and even from in&s;pecting the parts, it is ea&s;y to conceive how rumination is performed, and why the hor&s;e neither rumi|nates nor vomits. Rumination is only a vomit|ing without much effort, occa&s;ioned by the re|action of the fir&s;t &s;tomach upon its contents. The ox completely fills his two fir&s;t &s;tomachs, or portions of the paunch. This membrane, when di&s;tended, re-acts with great force on the food it contains, which is very little cut by chew|ing, and who&s;e volume is greatly augmented by fermentation. If the aliment were liquid, this contracting force would make it pa&s;s into the third &s;tomach, which communicates with the other by a narrow canal, who&s;e orifice is &s;ituated in the &s;uperior part of the fir&s;t, and nearly as high as that of the gullet. Hence this canal can on|ly admit the food, after it is reduced to a more fluid form. The drier parts mu&s;t, therefore, ri&s;e into the gullet, the orifice of which exceeds that of the canal. When the food comes back into the mouth, the animal chews it again, and macerates it with a fre&s;h quantity of &s;aliva, which gradually liquifies it to &s;uch a degree, as enables it to pa&s;s through the canal into the third &s;to|mach, where it is &s;till farther diluted before it enters the fourth. It is in this la&s;t &s;tomach that the hay, which is there reduced to a perfect mucilage, is completely decompo&s;ed. To con|firm the truth of this explanation, it may be re|marked, that, as long as the&s;e animals &s;uck, or <PB N="449" REF="456"> are nouri&s;hed with milk, and other liquid ali|ments, they never ruminate; and that, in win|ter, when they are fed with dry aliment, they ruminate much oftener than during &s;ummer, when the gra&s;s is tender and &s;ucculent. The &s;tomach of the hor&s;e, on the contrary, is &s;mall; the orifice of the oe&s;ophagus is narrow, and that of the pylorus very large. The&s;e circum&s;tances alone render rumination impracticable; for the food contained in this &s;mall &s;tomach, though perhaps it &s;uffers a greater compre&s;&s;ion than from the &s;tomach of the ox, cannot mount upwards; becau&s;e it de&s;cends with greater ea&s;e through the pylorus, which is much wider than the gul|let. To pa&s;s through the pylorus, it is not even nece&s;&s;ary that the hay be reduced to a &s;oft ma&s;h; for the contracting force of the &s;tomach is ca|pable of pu&s;hing it through, when almo&s;t dry. This difference of &s;tructure, therefore, enables the ox to ruminate, and prevents the hor&s;e from performing that function. But there is another &s;ingularity in the hor&s;e, which ab&s;olutely pre|vents him from vomiting, and, con&s;equently, from chewing the cud. The alimentary canal, by coming in a very winding direction into the &s;tomach, the coats of which are exceedingly thick, makes a gutter in piercing them, &s;o ob|lique, that, in&s;tead of being opened by the con|vul&s;ive motions of the &s;tomach, they only &s;erve to &s;hut it the clo&s;er. Though this, as well as other differences of &s;tructure ob&s;ervable in the <PB N="450" REF="457"> bodies of the&s;e two animals, are derived from Nature, becau&s;e they are invariably the &s;ame; yet, in the development of the &s;oft parts particularly, there are differences apparently con&s;tant, which, neverthele&s;s, may, and of|ten are varied by particular circum&s;tances. The great capacity of the ox's paunch, for ex|ample, is not &s;olely a production of Nature. Its original conformation, on the contrary, is vari|ed, and its capacity gradually enlarged, by the fermentation and great volume of the aliments it receives: For, in a calf that has never eat gra&s;s, though not very young, the paunch is pro|portionally much le&s;s than in the adult. Hence this uncommon capaciou&s;ne&s;s of the paunch proceeds from the exten&s;ion occa&s;ioned by the great ma&s;s of aliment daily devoured. Of this I was convinced by an experiment, which ap|pears to be deci&s;ive. I fed two lambs, of equal ages, and weaned, at the &s;ame time, the one with bread, and the other with gra&s;s. At the end of twelve months, when both were opened, I found that the paunch of the latter was much larger than that of the former.</P>
<P>It is alledged, that <HI>oxen</HI> which eat &s;lowly, &s;up|port labour longer than tho&s;e that eat quickly; that the <HI>oxen</HI> of dry and elevated countries are more active, vigorous, and healthful, than tho&s;e which are fed in low moi&s;t grounds; that they are &s;tronger when fed with dry hay than with &s;oft gra&s;s; that they are more difficulty habi|tuated <PB N="451" REF="458"> to a change of climate than hor&s;es; and, for this rea&s;on, that <HI>oxen</HI> de&s;igned for labour ought never to be brought from any great di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>As the <HI>oxen</HI> are idle in winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Are we from this to conclude, that the oxen in France labour none during the winter? We &s;hould rather imagine that winter is the mo&s;t bu&s;y &s;ea&s;on for ploughing there, as well as in Britain, unle&s;s in di&s;tricts where the &s;oil con&s;i&s;ts of very &s;trong clay, &amp;c.</NOTE>, they may be fed with &s;traw and a little hay. But, in the la|bouring &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hould have more hay than &s;traw, and even a little bran or oats. In win|ter, if the hay be &s;carce, they &s;hould be fed with cut gra&s;s, or rather with the young &s;hoots and leaves of the a&s;h, elm, oak, &amp;c. But of the&s;e la&s;t they &s;hould be allowed only &s;mall quanti|ties; becau&s;e indulgence in this kind of food, of which they are exceedingly fond, &s;ometimes occa&s;ions a bloody urine. Lucerne, &s;aintfoine, vetches, whether green or dry, lupins, turnips, boiled barley, &amp;c. afford them excellent nouri&s;h|ment; and, as they never u&s;e more than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould always have as much as they will take. They &s;hould not be permitted to pa&s;ture till the middle of May; becau&s;e young herbage is too crude for them; and, though they eat it with avidity, it &s;ometimes makes them unea&s;y. They &s;hould be pa&s;tured during the whole &s;ummer, and, about the middle of <PB N="452" REF="459"> October, they &s;hould be brought back to the &s;tall, always taking care not to make their chan|ges from green food to dry, or from dry to green, too rapid, but to accu&s;tom them gradual|ly to the&s;e different kinds of aliment.</P>
<P>Great heat is perhaps more hurtful to tho&s;e animals than great cold. During &s;ummer, they &s;hould be &s;et to work very early in the morn|ing, put into the &s;table, or left to graze under the &s;hade of trees, in the middle of the day, and not yoked again till three or four o'clock after noon. In &s;pring, autumn, and winter, they may be wrought, without interruption, from eight or nine in the morning to five or &s;ix in the evening. Though they require not &s;o much attention as the hor&s;e; yet, to keep them vigo|rous and healthful, they &s;hould be daily curried and wa&s;hed; their hoofs &s;hould likewi&s;e be rubbed over with grea&s;e. They &s;hould al&s;o have drink, at lea&s;t twice a day. Though the hor&s;e loves muddy and lukewarm water, the ox al|ways prefers that which is fre&s;h and clean.</P>
<P>Though the cow, in general, requires the &s;ame food and management as the <HI>ox</HI>; yet, the milk-cow demands particular attention, both in the choice and treatment of her. It is &s;aid, that black cows give the be&s;t milk; and that white cows furni&s;h the greate&s;t quantity of it. But, whatever be the colour of a milk-cow, &s;he ought to be plump, to have lively eyes, and a light|ne&s;s in her motions. She &s;hould likewi&s;e be <PB N="453" REF="460"> young, and give plenty of good milk. In &s;um|mer, &s;he &s;hould be milked twice a-day, and on|ly once in winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a better practice to milk cows three times a day in &s;ummer, and twice in winter.</NOTE>; and, when an increa&s;e in the quantity of milk is required, &s;he ought to have more &s;ucculent food than herbage.</P>
<P>Good milk is neither too thick nor too thin. Its con&s;i&s;tence &s;hould be &s;uch, that a &s;mall drop ought to pre&s;erve its &s;pherical figure, without running. It &s;hould al&s;o be very white; when of a yellow|i&s;h or bluei&s;h colour, it is of no value. Its ta&s;te &s;hould be &s;weet, without any degree of bitter|ne&s;s or &s;harpne&s;s. Its flavour &s;hould be agree|able. In the month of May, and during the &s;ummer, milk is better than in winter; and it is never perfectly good, but when the cow is of a proper age, and in good health. The milk of young heifers is too thin, and that of old cows is too dry, and too thick, e&s;pecially in winter. The&s;e different qualities of milk are proportion|ed to the quantities of oily, ca&s;eous, and &s;erous particles it contains. Thin milk has too great a quantity of &s;erous particles; too thick milk has the oppo&s;ite quality; and milk that is too dry, has not enough of the oily and &s;erous par|ticles. The milk of a cow in &s;ea&s;on, or when near the end of ge&s;tation, or &s;oon after delivery, is bad. In the third and fourth &s;tomachs of a &s;ucking calf, there are clots of curdled milk, which, after being dried in the air, become <PB N="454" REF="461"> runnet, or that well known &s;ub&s;tance which coagulates milk. The longer the runnet is kept, its &s;trength increa&s;es, and a &s;mall quantity of it is &s;ufficient to make a great deal of chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Both cows and <HI>oxen</HI> are fond of wine, vine|gar, and &s;alt; and they devour a dre&s;&s;ed &s;alled with great avidity. In Spain, and &s;ome other countries, they put one of tho&s;e &s;alt &s;tones, cal|led
<HI>&s;alegres,</HI> and which are found in the &s;alt|mines, near the young calves in the &s;table. They lick this &s;tone during the time their mo|thers are pa&s;turing, which excites their appetite, or creates thir&s;t to &s;uch a degree, that, when the mothers return, the calves &s;uck greedily, and, by this means, they grow and fatten much &s;ooner than tho&s;e to whom no &s;alt is given. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, when <HI>oxen</HI> lo&s;e their appetite, they are &s;erved with gra&s;s drenched in vinegar, or &s;prinkled with &s;alt. To make them fatten quickly, &s;alt, as it increa&s;es their appetite, may al&s;o be admini&s;tered. It is common to begin to fatten them at the age of ten years. If long|er delayed, &s;ucce&s;s is not &s;o certain, neither is their fle&s;h equally good. They may be fattened in all &s;ea&s;ons; but &s;ummer is preferable, becau&s;e le&s;s expence is incurred; and, by beginning in May or June, they are fit for the butcher before the end of October. Whenever we begin to fatten <HI>oxen,</HI> they &s;hould no longer be allowed to labour. They ought to drink frequently, to have plenty of &s;ucculent food, &s;ometimes mixed <PB N="455" REF="462"> with a little &s;alt; and they &s;hould be permitted to ruminate and &s;leep in the &s;table during the heat of the day. By this treatment, in four or five months, they will be &s;o fat as to be hardly able to walk, or be conducted to any di&s;tance but by very &s;hort journies. Cows, and even bulls who&s;e te&s;ticles have been twi&s;ted, [<HI>tau|reaux bi&s;tournes</HI>], may al&s;o be fattened. But the fle&s;h of the cow is drier than that of the <HI>ox</HI>; and the fle&s;h of the bull, even when maimed, is red, hard, and has a &s;trong di&s;agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Bulls, cows, and oxen, are fond of licking them&s;elves, e&s;pecially when lying at their ea&s;e. To prevent this practice, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to retard their fattening, it is common to be&s;mear every part of the body they can reach with their own dung<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This precaution is unnece&s;&s;ary; for the di&s;order mentioned in the text is extremely rare. Be&s;ides, it is a common notion, that licking promotes the health of cattle. It is certain, how|ever, that licking is a mark of their beginning to get into fle&s;h.</NOTE>. If this precaution be ne|glected, they &s;wallow great quantities of hair, which, being an indige&s;tible &s;ub&s;tance, remains in the &s;tomach, and forms a kind of balls, called
<HI>aegagropilae,</HI> of a &s;ize &s;o con&s;iderable as to hurt the powers of dige&s;tion. The&s;e balls, in proce&s;s of time, are covered with a brown cru&s;t, which, though formed of mucilage, becomes hard and poli&s;hed. They are only found in the maw; and, if any hairs enter into the other &s;tomachs, or bowels, they are probably di&s;charged along with the faeces.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="463"> Animals which, like the hor&s;e and a&s;s, have cutting teeth in both jaws, brow&s;e &s;hort gra&s;s with more ea&s;e than tho&s;e that want the&s;e teeth in the upper jaw. The &s;heep and goat, indeed, cut very clo&s;e, becau&s;e they are &s;mall animals, and have thin lips. But the ox, who&s;e lips are thick, can only eat long gra&s;s. It is for this rea&s;on that he does no injury to the pa&s;ture on which he feeds. As he only bites off the ex|tremities of young herbage, the roots are not di&s;turbed, and the growth is very little retarded. The &s;heep and goat, on the contrary, cut the plants &s;o clo&s;e to the ground, that the &s;tems are de&s;troyed and the roots &s;poiled. Be&s;ides, the hor&s;e always &s;elects the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t tender, allowing that which is longer and harder to ri|pen and &s;hed the &s;eeds. But the ox devours all the large &s;tems, and gradually de&s;troys the coar|&s;er kinds of gra&s;s. Hence, in a few years, gra&s;s pa&s;tured by the hor&s;e degenerates, while the ox always improves the herbage on which he feeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rea&s;oning has by no means the &s;anction of experience.

Be&s;ides, this &s;pecies, &s;o abun|dantly diffu&s;ed over all Europe, is not found in the equatorial regions, and extends not, in A&s;ia, beyond Armenia and Per&s;ia, nor, in Africa, be|yond Egypt and Barbary: For, in India, the &s;outhern parts of Africa, and even in America, their native cattle are either bi&s;ons, which have a protuberance on their backs, or other animals of a different &s;pecies, to whom travellers have gi|ven the name of oxen. Tho&s;e found at the Cape of Good Hope, and in many parts of America, were tran&s;ported thither from Europe by the Dutch and Spaniards. In general, countries which are &s;omewhat cold, &s;eem to be more a|greeable to our oxen than warm climates. They are likewi&s;e larger and taller in proportion to the moi&s;tne&s;s of the climate, and the richne&s;s of the pa&s;ture. The large&s;t oxen are tho&s;e of Den|mark, Podolia, the Ukraine, and Calmuck Tar|tary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Reynard, tom. 1. p. 217. and l'Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 7. p. 13.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e of Britain, Ireland, Holland, and Hungary, are larger than tho&s;e of Per&s;ia, Tur|key, Greece, Italy, France, and Spain; and the Barbary oxen are the mo&s;t diminutive. The Dutch, I am a&s;&s;ured, bring annually from Denmark a great number of large meagre cows, which give more milk than tho&s;e of France. The milch-cows, called <HI>Lath-backs,</HI> which are numerous in Poitou, Aunis, and the fens of Charpente, have probably been derived <PB N="458" REF="465"> from this race; for they are larger, leaner, and yield more milk and butter than the common kind. They may be milked during the whole year, excepting four or five days before they bring forth; but they require excellent pa&s;ture. Though they eat not more than ordinary cows, as they continue always meagre, all their &s;uper|fluous nouri&s;hment is converted into milk. But, whenever ordinary cows feed for &s;ome time in rich pa&s;tures, they become fat, and cea&s;e to give milk. With a bull of this race, and common cows, a ba&s;tard kind is produced, which is more fertile in milk than the ordinary race. This ba|&s;tard race frequently bring forth two calves at a birth, and likewi&s;e give milk during the whole year. Cows form a part of the riches of Hol|land, from which con&s;iderable quantities of but|ter and chee&s;e are annually exported. The Dutch cows give twice as much milk as the French cows, and &s;ix times more than tho&s;e of Bar|bary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Shaw's Travels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In Ireland, Britain, Holland, Switzerland, and other northern countries, great quantities of beef are &s;alted and &s;moked, both for the pur|po&s;es of trade, and for the u&s;e of the navy.

The dung of the ox is the be&s;t manure for dry and light <PB N="459" REF="466"> &s;oils. The horn of this animal afforded to men the fir&s;t in&s;trument for drinking, for augment|ing &s;ounds, for introducing light into hou&s;es, and for making lanthorns.

<P>THAT all dome&s;tic animals originally ex|i&s;ted in a wild or &s;avage &s;tate, &s;eems to be an inconte&s;tible fact: The hi&s;tory of tho&s;e al|ready given furni&s;hes ample proof of this po&s;i|tion; for we &s;till find hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, and bulls, living totally independent of the human race. Can man, who has &s;ubjected &s;o many millions of individuals, boa&s;t of having conquered and en&s;laved an entire &s;pecies? As all animals were created without his aid, is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that Nature be&s;towed on them the fa|culty of exi&s;ting and of multiplying without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance? If, however, we attend to the weak|ne&s;s and &s;tupidity of the &s;heep; if we con&s;ider, that this helple&s;s animal is even unable to &s;ave him&s;elf by flight; that all the carnivorous ani|mals are not only his mortal enemies, but prefer him to every other prey; that the &s;pecies are not very fertile; that the life of individuals is &s;hort, &amp;c. we would be tempted to think, that <PB N="463" REF="471"> the &s;heep was originally committed to the pro|tection and guardian&s;hip of man, and that, with|out his aid, this animal could neither &s;ub&s;i&s;t nor multiply, e&s;pecially as no wild &s;heep have ever been found in the de&s;erts. Wherever man has not the dominion, the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, reign by the laws of force and of cruelty. The&s;e &s;anguinary and rapacious animals live longer and multiply fa&s;ter than the &s;heep. In a word, if our flocks, which are now &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly numerous, were &s;till abandoned, the number and voracity of their enemies would annihilate the &s;pecies in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, probable, that, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of man, the &s;heep could never have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, or continued its &s;pecies in a wild &s;tate. The female is ab&s;olutely devoid of every art, and of every mean of defence. The arms of the ram are feeble and awkward. His courage is only a kind of petulance, which is u&s;ele&s;s to him&s;elf, incommodious to his neighbours, and is totally de&s;troyed by ca&s;tration. The wedder is &s;till more timid than the &s;heep. It is fear alone that makes &s;heep &s;o frequently a&s;&s;emble in troops: Upon the &s;malle&s;t unnu&s;ual noi&s;e, they run clo&s;e together; and the&s;e alarms are always accompanied with the greate&s;t &s;tupidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though the talents of the &s;heep are not &s;o brilliant as tho&s;e of &s;ome other quadrupeds; yet he appears not to be that &s;tupid, defencele&s;s, timid creature painted in the text. All tame animals lo&s;e a portion of that &s;agacity, dexterity, and courage, which they are obliged to employ again&s;t their enemies in a wild &s;tate; becau&s;e they have been long accu|&s;tomed to rely upon the protection of man. Sheep, when en&s;laved by men, tremble at the voice of the &s;hepherd or his dog. But, on tho&s;e exten&s;ive mountains, where they are allowed to range almo&s;t without control, and where they &s;eldom depend on the aid of the &s;hepherd, they a&s;&s;ume a very different mode of be|haviour. In this &s;ituation, a ram, or a wedder, boldly attacks a &s;ingle dog, and often comes off victorious. But, when the danger is of a more alarming nature, like man, they tru&s;t not to the prowe&s;s of individuals, but have recour&s;e to the collected &s;trength of the whole flock. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, they draw up into one compact body; they place the young and the fe|males in the centre; and the &s;tronge&s;t males take the foremo&s;t ranks, keeping clo&s;e by each others &s;ides. Thus an armed front is pre&s;ented on all quarters, and cannot be attacked without the greate&s;t hazard of de&s;truction. In this manner they wait, with firmne&s;s and intrepidity, the approach of the enemy. Nor does their courage fail them in the moment of attack: For, if the aggre&s;&s;or advances within a few yards of the line, the rams dart upon him with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as lays him dead at their feet, unle&s;s he &s;aves him&s;elf by flight. Again&s;t the attacks of &s;ingle dogs, or foxes, they are, when in this &s;ituation, perfectly &s;ecure. Be&s;ides, a ram, regardle&s;s of danger, often engages a bull, and never fails to conquer him; for the bull, by lowering his head, without being &s;en&s;ible of his defencele&s;s condition, receives be|tween his horns the &s;troke of the ram, which u&s;ually brings him to the ground.</P>
<P>In the &s;election of food, few animals di&s;cover greater &s;agacity than the &s;heep; nor does any dome&s;tic animal &s;how more dexte|rity and cunning in its attempts to elude the vigilance of the &s;hepherd, and to &s;teal &s;uch delicacies as are agreeable to its pa|late. The boldne&s;s of the female, when not in a &s;tate of ab|&s;olute &s;lavery, in protecting her young from injury, is likewi&s;e extremely remarkable. When perfectly tamed, and rendered dome&s;tic, the &s;portive gambols, and trouble&s;ome tricks of this animal, are too well known to require any de&s;cription.</P></NOTE>. They <PB N="464" REF="472"> know not how to fly from danger, and &s;eem not even to be con&s;cious of the hazard and inconve|nience <PB N="465" REF="473"> of their &s;ituation. Wherever they are, there they remain ob&s;tinately fixed; and neither rain nor &s;now can make them quit their &s;tation. To force them to move, or to change their route, they mu&s;t be provided with a chief, who is learn|ed to begin the march: The motions of this chief are followed, &s;tep by &s;tep, by the re&s;t of the flock. But the chief him&s;elf would al&s;o con|tinue immoveable, if he were not pu&s;hed off by the &s;hepherd, or by his dog, an animal which perpetually watches over their &s;afety, which de|fends, directs, &s;eparates, a&s;&s;embles, and, in a word, communicates to them every movement nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupeds, therefore, &s;heep are the mo&s;t &s;tupid, and derive the &s;malle&s;t re&s;ources from in&s;tinct. The goat, who &s;o greatly re|&s;embles the &s;heep in other re&s;pects, is endowed with much more &s;agacity. He knows how to conduct him&s;elf on every emergency: He a|voids danger with dexterity, and is ea&s;ily re|conciled to new objects. But the &s;heep knows neither how to fly nor to attack: However im|minent her danger, &s;he comes not to man for a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o willingly as the goat; and, to com|plete the picture of timidity and want of &s;enti|ment, &s;he allows her lamb to be carried off, without attempting to defend it, or &s;howing any marks of re&s;entment. Her grief is not even expre&s;&s;ed by any cry different from that of ordi|nary bleating<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is another heavy charge again&s;t the character of the &s;heep. But every per&s;on who has attended to tho&s;e animals, at lea&s;t in this country, mu&s;t know that the accu&s;ation is not alto|gether ju&s;t. Individuals, in a &s;tate of &s;ubjection, &s;eem to have no idea of re&s;i&s;ting the attacks of an enemy. But they &s;oon learn that their protection lies in the &s;hepherd or his dog; for, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, in Britain, to watch the folds, in or|der to prevent a&s;&s;aults from foxes or dogs, upon the fir&s;t alarm, the whole flock run with violence to the place where the watch|men are &s;tationed; &s;o that, when they chance to &s;leep, they are often hurt by the &s;heep trampling upon them. On other occa&s;ions, they never choo&s;e to make a very clo&s;e approach either to men or dogs; but the &s;en&s;e of immediate danger make them forget their u&s;ual timidity, and their &s;agacity teaches them where their &s;afety lies. When the female is robbed of her lamb, &s;he bleats in a manner that &s;trongly marks the angui&s;h &s;he feels. In the eagerne&s;s of her &s;earch, her eye-balls &s;eem to &s;tart from their &s;ockets; and her irregular and di&s;tracted motions, joined to the violence and con&s;tancy of her bleatings, are evident indications of the mo&s;t pungent grief.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="474"> But this animal, &s;o contemptible in it&s;elf, and &s;o devoid of every mental quality, is, of all o|thers, the mo&s;t exten&s;ively u&s;eful to man. From the &s;heep we are at once &s;upplied both with food and cloathing, without mentioning the particular advantages derived from the milk, the fat, the &s;kin, the bowels, the bones, and the dung.

<P>Love, which, in animals, is the mo&s;t active and mo&s;t general &s;en&s;ation, &s;eems to be the only one that communicates vivacity to the ram. When under the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion, he be|comes petulant, fights, and &s;ometimes even at|tacks the &s;hepherd. But the ewe, though in <PB N="467" REF="475"> &s;ea&s;on, di&s;covers not the &s;malle&s;t emotion: Her in&s;tinct extends no farther than not to refu&s;e the approaches of the male, to choo&s;e her food, and to di&s;tingui&s;h her own offspring from tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the flock.

The &s;heep has few in&s;tincts; and, therefore, as there is le&s;s danger of being di&s;tracted by a variety of motives to action, the animal is led with greater certainty to the purpo&s;es intended by Nature.</NOTE>. A young lamb, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t numerous flocks, &s;earches for, and di&s;covers its mother, without ever once com|mitting a mi&s;take.

<P>The&s;e animals, &s;o &s;imple and dull in their in|tellect, are likewi&s;e very feeble in their con&s;ti|tution. They cannot continue long in motion&punc; Travelling weakens and extenuates them.

They are &s;ubject to many di&s;ea&s;es, mo&s;t of which are contagious. A redundancy of fat often kills them, and always renders the ewes barren: They bring forth with difficulty, frequently mi&s;carry, and require more care than any other dome&s;tic animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is unque&s;tionably another exaggeration. The &s;heep, when nearly in a wild &s;tate, is a robu&s;t, active animal, and ca|pable of enduring much fatigue without injury.

<P>When the ewe is about to bring forth, &s;he &s;hould be &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the flock, and watched, in order to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in delivery. The lamb frequently pre&s;ents cro&s;s|ways, or by the feet. In &s;uch ca&s;es, if not a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, the mother's life is in great danger. When &s;he is delivered, the lamb &s;hould be rai&s;ed on its feet, and the milk &s;hould be drawn from the paps of the mother. As this fir&s;t milk is bad<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is difficult to conceive that Nature &s;hould prepare a fluid for the nouri&s;hment of young animals, which, in&s;tead of being &s;alutary, would, in the mo&s;t critical period of their exi&s;tence, be noxious to them. Such opinions require the &s;upport of facts; for, in this country, no lambs thrive &s;o well as tho&s;e which are left entirely to the care of the dam. In ca&s;es of preternatural labour, or when the mother is much debilitated, a&s;&s;i&s;tance is un|que&s;tionably nece&s;&s;ary; but ca&s;es of this kind are not common.</NOTE>, and would be hurtful to the lamb, it &s;hould not <PB N="469" REF="477"> be permitted to &s;uck till a fresh &s;tock has accu|mulated.

To recover the &s;trength of the ewe, &s;he &s;hould be fed, for &s;ome time, with good hay, grinded barley, or bran mixed with a little &s;alt. Her water &s;hould be luke|warm, and whitened with the flour of wheat, beans, or millet.

In our northern climates, it is even injurious to them.</NOTE>; but, to prevent the milk from being chaffed, &s;he &s;hould not be con|ducted to any great di&s;tance. Some time after, when the lamb has acquired &s;trength, and begins to fri&s;k about, it may be allowed to follow its mother to the fields.</P>
<P>All the lambs which have the appearance of feeblene&s;s are generally &s;ent to the butcher; and tho&s;e only are kept which are mo&s;t vigo|rous, large&s;t, and be&s;t covered with wool. Lambs of the fir&s;t litter are never &s;o good as tho&s;e of &s;ucceeding litters. When we want to rear lambs which are brought forth in the months of October, November, December, January, or Fe|bruary, they are kept in the &s;table, and only al|lowed to go out to &s;uck every morning and <PB N="470" REF="478"> evening, till the beginning of April. Some time before this la&s;t period, they are fed with a little gra&s;s every day, to accu&s;tom them to their new &s;pecies of nouri&s;hment. They may be weaned when a month old; but it is better to &s;uckle them &s;ix weeks or two months. White lambs are always preferred to tho&s;e which are black or &s;potted; becau&s;e white wool gives a higher price than that of any other colour.</P>
<P>In the temperate weather of &s;pring or autumn, the lambs may be ca&s;trated at the age of five or &s;ix months, or even a little later<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ooner lambs are ca&s;trated, the operation is attended with the le&s;s danger. But there is always a nece&s;&s;ity for delay|ing it till the te&s;ticles fall down into the &s;crotum, which &s;ome|times happens not till they are &s;everal weeks, or even &s;ome months old. There are examples where only one of the te&s;ti|cles de&s;cends. In ca&s;es of this kind, though the te&s;ticle that has come down be cut off, and the animal cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a wedder; yet he &s;till retains the power of procreating. In Scotland, &s;heep of this kind are called <HI>wrigglings.</HI></NOTE>. There are two methods of performing this operation. The te&s;ticles are either removed by inci&s;ion, or the ve&s;&s;els which terminate in them are de&s;troyed by a &s;trait ligature. Ca&s;tration renders lambs &s;ick and melancholy. To prevent the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;ucceeds, they &s;hould have bran mixed with &s;alt for two or three days.</P>
<P>At the age of twelve months, rams, ewes, and wedders, lo&s;e the two fore-teeth of the under jaw: Six months after, the two neighbouring teeth likewi&s;e fall out; and, at three years of <PB N="471" REF="479"> age, they are all replaced, and are then equal and pretty white. But, in proportion as the animal increa&s;es in years, the teeth begin to lo&s;e their enamel, and become blunt, unequal, and black. The age of the ram may be known by his horns, which appear the fir&s;t year, and often at birth, and have a fre&s;h ring added to them every year that he lives. Ewes &s;eldom have any horns; but, in place of them, they have two bony pro|tuberances. Some ewes, however, have two, and even four horns. The&s;e ewes are every way &s;imilar to the common kind; and their horns are from five to &s;ix inches long, and le&s;s twi&s;ted than tho&s;e of the ram. When ewes have four horns, the two anterior ones are &s;horter than the other two. The ram is capable of ge|nerating in 18 months, and the ewe can produce when a year old. But it is better to prevent all communication between them till the ewe be two years of age, and the ram three. The young produced at more early periods, and even the fir&s;t productions of the&s;e animals, are always feeble and ill-conditioned. One ram is more than &s;ufficient to &s;erve 25 or 30 ewes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A ram has been often known to beget one hundred lambs in a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on.</NOTE>. The ram &s;hould always be &s;elected from the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t hand&s;ome of his &s;pecies. They &s;hould be garni&s;hed with horns; for hornle&s;s rams, of which there are &s;ome in our climates, are le&s;s <PB N="472" REF="480"> vigorous and le&s;s proper for propagating<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many breeds of &s;heep in which both males and females want horns; yet they are as vigorous as any of the &s;pe|cies. The large&s;t and fine&s;t &s;heep in England have no horns. In &s;ome counties, the inhabitants are perfectly unacquainted with horned &s;heep. In other places, a &s;heep without horns is as great a rarity as one with four or &s;ix horns.</NOTE>. A good and beautiful ram &s;hould have a &s;trong thick head, a wide front, large black eyes, a flat no&s;e, big ears, a thick neck, a long high body, a large crupper and reins, ma&s;&s;y te&s;ticles, and a long tail. The be&s;t rams for breeding are tho&s;e which are of a white colour, well covered with wool upon the belly, the tail, the head, the ears, and as far as the eyes. Ewes, who&s;e wool is mo&s;t abundant, mo&s;t bu&s;hy, large&s;t, mo&s;t &s;ilky, and white&s;t, are always to be preferred, e&s;pecial|ly if, at the &s;ame time, they are large, have thick necks, and walk nimbly. It has al&s;o been remarked, that tho&s;e which are rather meagre than fat, are the be&s;t breeders.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of ewes is from the beginning of November to the end of April. However, when nouri&s;hed with &s;timulating food, as bread made of hemp-&s;eed, and &s;alted water, they conceive at any time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In this climate, ewes fed in good pa&s;tures admit the ram in July or Augu&s;t; but September and October are the months when the greate&s;t part of our ewes, if left to nature, take the ram. Neither is it cu&s;tomary, at this &s;ea&s;on, to give them dry food: nor would &s;uch a practice be po&s;&s;ible in large flocks. When the object is to force nature prematurely, &s;ome &s;timula|ting food may, perhaps, have the de&s;ired effect. It is more com|mon, however, to retard the &s;ea&s;on of general copulation, by &s;eparating the rams from the ewes, than to forward it The rule is, to admit the ram at &s;uch a time as will bring the ewes to lamb when there will be plenty of food for them; for, if they bring forth before the gra&s;s is good, the lambs become poor and feeble.</NOTE>. Ewes are allowed to be covered <PB N="473" REF="481"> three or four times; after which they are &s;epa|rated from the rams, who prefer the aged ewes, and de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e that are younger. During the rutting &s;ea&s;on, ewes &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to rainy or &s;tormy weather; for moi&s;ture prevents conception, and a clap of thunder often produces an abortion. A day or two after copulating, they are allowed to return to their ordinary mode of living; for, if the u&s;e of &s;alted water, hemp|&s;eed-bread, and other &s;timulating food, were continued, they would infallibly mi&s;carry. They carry five months, and bring forth in the begin|ning of the &s;ixth. They generally produce one lamb, but &s;ometimes two. In warm climates, they can produce twice a year; but, in France, and in colder climates, only once. To have lambs in the month of January, the ram is ad|mitted to the ewes towards the end of July, or beginning of Augu&s;t. Tho&s;e which are cover|ed in September, October, and November, pro|duce in February, March, and April. We may al&s;o have plenty of lambs in May, June, July, Augu&s;t, and September; and they only become rare in October, November, and December. The ewes give milk abundantly for &s;even or eight months. This milk affords pretty good nou|ri&s;hment <PB N="474" REF="482"> to children and country-people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The milk of ewes, in its natural &s;tate, is nau&s;eous, and &s;eldom u&s;ed by man in this country. We u&s;ually convert it into chee&s;e.</NOTE>. It makes very good chee&s;e, e&s;pecially when mixed with cow-milk. The time of milking ewes is immediately before they go out to the field, or &s;oon after their return. In &s;ummer, they may be twice milked every day, and once in winter.</P>
<P>Ewes, when with young, grow fat; becau&s;e they then eat more than at any other period. As they frequently hurt them&s;elves, and mi&s;|carry, they &s;ometimes become barren, and &s;ome of them produce mon&s;ters. However, when properly managed, they bring forth during life,
<HI>i. e.</HI> for ten or twelve years; but they are ge|nerally old and u&s;ele&s;s at the age of &s;even or eight years. The ram, who lives twelve or four|teen years, becomes unfit for propagating when eight years old. He &s;hould then be ca&s;trated, and fattened along with the old ewes. The fle&s;h of the ram, even after being ca&s;trated and fat|tened, has always a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te: That of the ewe is flabby and in&s;ipid. But the fle&s;h of the wedder furni&s;hes the mo&s;t &s;ucculent and be&s;t of all our common di&s;hes.</P>
<P>When men want to form a flock with a view to profit, they purcha&s;e ewes and wedders at the age of eighteen months, or two years, and a hundred of the&s;e might be managed by a &s;ingle &s;hepherd<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In an open country, and exten&s;ive pa&s;ture, a good &s;hepherd, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his dog, will manage, with ea&s;e, ten times the number mentioned in the text.</NOTE>. If vigilant, and aided by a good <PB N="475" REF="483"> dog, he will lo&s;e very few of them. When con|ducting them to the fields, he ought to go be|fore, accu&s;tom them to the &s;ound of his voice, and to following him without &s;topping, or go|ing a&s;ide among the corn, or the vines, where they commit great deva&s;tation. The &s;ea-coa&s;ts, or plains on the tops of hills, afford them the be&s;t pa&s;ture. But low, moi&s;t, and mar&s;hy grounds, &s;hould always be avoided. During winter, they are fed, in the &s;table, with bran, turnip, hay, &s;traw, lucerne, &s;aintfoine, a&s;h and elm leaves, &amp;c. When the weather is not very bad, they &s;hould be allowed, chiefly for the &s;ake of exerci&s;e, to go out every day. In this cold &s;ea&s;on, they are not led to the fields before ten in the morn|ing, where they remain for four or five hours: After which they are made to drink, and are conducted back about three o'clock afternoon. In &s;pring and autumn, on the contrary, they are led out as &s;oon as the &s;un has di&s;&s;ipated the moi|&s;ture, or hoar-fro&s;t, and are not brought back till &s;un-&s;et. In the&s;e two &s;ea&s;ons, it is &s;ufficient to make them drink once a-day, and immedi|ately before they return to the &s;table, where they mu&s;t always have forage, but in &s;maller quantity than during winter. It is only in &s;ummer that they ought to feed entirely in the fields, where they are conducted twice a-day, and al&s;o made to drink twice. They are brought out at day-break, allowed to feed four or five hours, and, after drinking, are led back to the fold, or &s;ome <PB N="476" REF="484"> other &s;hady place. About three or four o'clock afternoon, when the exce&s;&s;ive heat begins to di|mini&s;h, they are again pa&s;tured till night comes on. Were it not for the ravages of the wolf, they ought to remain in the field during the whole night, as is practi&s;ed in Britain, which would make them both more vigorous and more healthful. As the rays of the &s;un, when very warm, are apt to affect the&s;e animals with a vertigo, they &s;hould always be pa&s;tured with their heads turned from the &s;un, &s;o that the body may form a kind of &s;hade to defend the head. La&s;tly, to pre&s;erve their wool, they &s;hould not be allowed to feed among thorns, briars, thi&s;tles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In dry elevated grounds, where the wild thime and other odoriferous plants abound, the fle&s;h of the &s;heep is of a better quality, than when fed in low moi&s;t plains. But &s;andy downs on the &s;ea-coa&s;t produce the be&s;t mutton, becau&s;e the herbage is &s;alti&s;h, and nothing improves the reli&s;h of mut|ton &s;o much as pa&s;ture of this kind: Be&s;ides, it gives an agreeable &s;avour to the milk of the ewe, and increa&s;es its quantity. The&s;e animals are extremely fond of &s;alt, and, when given in mo|derate quantities, it is very &s;alutary. In &s;ome places, a bag of &s;alt, or a &s;alt-&s;tone, is put into the fold, which the creatures lick alternately.</P>
<P>Every year, tho&s;e which begin to grow old, &s;hould be &s;eparated from the flock, for the pur|po&s;e of fattening, becau&s;e then a different ma|nagement <PB N="477" REF="485"> is nece&s;&s;ary. If, in &s;ummer, they &s;hould be conducted to the field before &s;un-ri|&s;ing, that they may feed upon gra&s;s moi&s;tened with dew. Nothing contributes more to fatten wedders than water taken in great quantities; and nothing retards their fattening more than the heat of the &s;un. For this rea&s;on, they &s;hould be put into the fold or &s;hade at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, before the heat becomes too violent; and they ought to have a little &s;alt, in order to excite their appetite for water. They &s;hould be led out a &s;econd time, about four o'clock afternoon, to fre&s;h and moi&s;t pa&s;tures. By this treatment, they acquire, in two or three months, all the appearances of being fle&s;hy and fat. But this fat, which originates from the great quantities of water drunk by the ani|mal, is only a kind of pur&s;y &s;welling, and would &s;oon occa&s;ion the rot, if not prevented by killing them immediately after they acquire this falla|cious appearance. Even their fle&s;h, in&s;tead of being firm and juicy, is frequently very loo&s;e and in&s;ipid. To produce good mutton, be&s;ide the treatment above recommended, the animals &s;hould have better nouri&s;hment than gra&s;s. In winter, and indeed in all &s;ea&s;ons, they may be fattened by keeping them in &s;tables, and feeding them with the flour of barley, oats, wheat, beans, &amp;c. mixed with &s;alt, to increa&s;e their appetite for drink. But, whatever mode be followed, it &s;hould be executed as quickly as po&s;&s;ible; for <PB N="478" REF="486"> they cannot be fattened a &s;econd time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not true; for &s;heep, like other animals, may occa|&s;ionally lo&s;e and regain the fat they had formerly acquired.</NOTE>, mo&s;t of them dying by di&s;ea&s;es of the liver.</P>
<P>Worms are frequently found in the livers of animals: A de&s;cription of tho&s;e of the wed|der and ox may be &s;een in the Journal des Sa|vans<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ann&eacute;e 1668.</NOTE>, and in the German Ephimerides<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tom. 5. Ann&eacute;es 1675, and 1676.</NOTE>. It was formerly imagined, that the&s;e worms were peculiar to ruminating animals: But M. Dauben|ton di&s;covered the &s;ame &s;pecies in the liver of the a&s;s; and it is probable they exi&s;t in &s;everal other quadrupeds. Butterflies, it has likewi&s;e been &s;aid, are &s;ometimes found in the liver of the wedder. M. Rouill&eacute; communicated to me a let|ter from M. Gachet de Beau&s;ort, phy&s;ician at Montiers, of which the following is an extract: 'It is an old remark, that our Alpine wedders, which are the be&s;t in Europe, &s;ometimes &s;ud|denly lo&s;e their fle&s;h; that their eyes turn white and gummy; that their blood grows &s;erous, having hardly any red globules; that their tongues are parched; and that their no&s;es are &s;tuffed with a yellow purulent mucus: Though the creatures continue to eat plentifully, the&s;e &s;ymptoms are accompanied with extreme debi|lity, and at la&s;t terminate in death. From re|peated di&s;&s;ections, it has been di&s;covered, that the animals had always butterflies in their li|vers. The&s;e butterflies were white, and fur|ni&s;hed with wings; and their heads were near|ly <PB N="479" REF="487"> oval, hairy, and about the &s;ize of tho&s;e of the &s;ilk-worm fly. Above &s;eventy, which I &s;queezed out of the two lobes, convinced me of the truth of this fact. The convex part of the liver was al&s;o in a mangled condition. The butterflies are found in the veins only, and ne|ver in the arteries. Small butterflies, and like|wi&s;e &s;mall worms, have been di&s;covered in the cy&s;tic duct. The vena portarum and cap&s;ala Gli&s;&s;onii were &s;o &s;oft, as to yield to the &s;light|e&s;t touch. The lungs, and other vi&s;cera, were &s;ound,' &amp;c. If Dr Gachet de Beau&s;ort had been more particular in his de&s;cription of the&s;e butterflies, he might, perhaps, have removed the &s;u&s;picion, that the animals he &s;aw were only the common worms found in the liver of the &s;heep, which are very flat, broad, and of a figure &s;o &s;ingular, as to appear, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be rather leaves than worms.</P>
<P>The wool of the &s;heep is &s;horn every year. In warm countries, where no danger ari&s;es from making the animal quite bare, they do not &s;heer the wool, but tear it off; and this operation is performed twice a-year. But in France, and in colder climates, the fleece is &s;horn only once a-year, and a part of it is allowed to remain, in order to protect the animal from the inclemency of the weather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The fleece of the &s;heep, like the fur of mo&s;t other quadru|peds, loo&s;ens from the &s;kin in the beginning of &s;ummer, and, if permitted, would fall, of its own accord, from the animal's body. To prevent the wa&s;te which would en&s;ue, the farmer &s;heers his &s;heep before the fleeces become altogether loo&s;e. If the opera|tion be longer delayed, the fleece breaks and falls off in detached pieces. Thus the proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;heering &s;heep is determined by Nature. When the young fleece begins to grow, it pu&s;hes the old one before it, which becomes loo&s;e at the root, and the &s;heep, after the operation, remains covered with clo&s;e &s;hort wool. When &s;heep are &s;horn before the young fleece has begun to grow, they are left too bare, and are in danger of catching cold. Be&s;ides, that part of the old fleece which is left on the animal, is entirely lo&s;t. If, on the other hand, the operation be delayed till the young fleece has grown &s;o long as to mix with the old one, a part of the former will be cut off, which, by being too &s;hort, is not only perpectly u&s;ele&s;s, in manufactures, but in|jures the long wool among which it is blended. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, a &s;killful farmer &s;heers not all his &s;heep indi&s;criminately at the &s;ame time, but occa&s;ionally as the fleeces become ripe.</P>
<P>It was formerly the practice, in&s;tead of &s;heering, to pluck the wool from the &s;heep. But, though it might be done at different times, as parts of the fleece loo&s;ened, without giving the animal any pain; yet the practice is &s;lovenly, incompatible with the management of large flocks, and often attended with a con&s;ide|rable lo&s;s of wool.</P></NOTE>. The operation is performed <PB N="480" REF="488"> in the month of May, after wa&s;hing the &s;heep, to render the wool as clean as po&s;&s;ible. The month of April is too cold; and, if delayed till June or July, the wool does not grow &s;ufficient|ly long to protect the animal from the cold of winter. The wool of the wedder is generally better, and in greater quantity, than that of the ewe or ram. The wool upon the neck and a|bout the top of the back, is of a better quality than that upon the thighs, the tail, the belly, &amp;c. and that taken from dead or di&s;ea&s;ed animals, is the wor&s;t. White wool is preferred to gray, <PB N="481" REF="489"> brown, or black, becau&s;e it is capable of being dyed any colour; and &s;mooth &s;leek wool is bet|ter than that which is curled. It is even alled|ged, that wedders, who&s;e wool is curled, are not &s;o good as the others.</P>
<P>Land may be much improved by folding &s;heep: For this purpo&s;e a piece of ground is in|clo&s;ed, and the flock &s;hut up in it every night during the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on. The dung, urine, and heat of the animals &s;oon meliorate exhau&s;t|ed, cold, or barren grounds. A hundred &s;heep, in one &s;ummer, will fertilize eight acres of land for &s;ix years.</P>
<P>It has been remarked by the antients, that all ruminating animals have &s;uet: But this remark, &s;trictly &s;peaking, holds only with regard to the &s;heep and goat: The &s;uet of the wedder is more copious, whiter, drier, firmer, and better than that of any other animal. Fat or grea&s;e is very different from &s;uet, the former being always &s;oft, while the latter hardens in cooling. The greate&s;t quantity of &s;uet is found about the kid|neys; and the left kidney furni&s;hes more than the right. There are al&s;o con&s;iderable quanti|ties in the epiploon or web, and about the in|te&s;tines; but it is not near &s;o firm or good as that of the kidneys, the tail, and other parts of the body. Wedders have no other grea&s;e but &s;uet; and this matter is &s;o prevalent in their bo|dies, that their whole fle&s;h is covered with it. Even the blood contains a con&s;iderable quantity <PB N="482" REF="490"> of &s;uet; and the &s;emen is &s;o charged with it, as to give that liquor a different appearance from that of other animals. The &s;emen of men, of the dog, hor&s;e, a&s;s, and probably of every animal which affords not &s;uet, di&s;&s;olves with cold; or, when expo&s;ed to the air, becomes more and more fluid from the moment it e&s;capes from the body. But the &s;emen of the ram, and perhaps of every animal that has &s;uet, hardens and lo&s;es its fluidity with its heat. I remarked this dif|ference when examining the&s;e liquors with the micro&s;cope: That of the ram fixes a few &s;e|conds after coming from the body; and, in or|der to di&s;cover the living organic particles, of which it contains prodigious numbers, its flui|dity mu&s;t be pre&s;erved by the application of heat.</P>
<P>In the &s;heep, the ta&s;te of the fle&s;h, the finene&s;s of the wool, the quantity of &s;uet, and even the &s;ize of the body, vary greatly in different countries. In France, the province of Berri abounds mo&s;t in &s;heep. Tho&s;e about Beauvais, and in &s;ome other parts of Normandy, are fatter and more charged with &s;uet. They are very good in Burgundy; but the be&s;t are fed upon the &s;andy downs of our maritime provinces. The Italian, Spani&s;h, and even the Engli&s;h wools, are finer than the French wool. In Poitou, Provence, the environs of Bayonne, and &s;everal other parts of France, there is a race of &s;heep which have the appearance of being foreign. They are larger, &s;tronger, and <PB REF="491" MS="y">

The rams of this race engender with the common ewes, and pro|duce an intermediate kind. In Italy and in Spain, there are a great variety of races; but they ought all to be regarded as of the &s;ame &s;pecies with our common &s;heep, which, though &s;o numerous and diver&s;ified, extend not beyond Europe. Tho&s;e animals with a long broad tail, &s;o common in A&s;ia and Africa, and which are called Barbary &s;heep by travellers, appear to be a &s;pecies dif|ferent from the ordinary kind, as well as from the Pacos and Lama of America.</P>
<P>As white wool is mo&s;t valued, black or &s;pot|ted lambs are generally &s;laughtered. In &s;ome places, however, almo&s;t all the &s;heep are black; and black lambs are often produced by the com|mixture of white rams with white ewes. In France, there are only white, brown, black, and &s;potted &s;heep: But in Spain, there is a reddi&s;h kind; and, in Scotland, there are &s;ome of a yel|lowi&s;h colour. But all the&s;e varieties of colour are more accidental than tho&s;e produced by dif|ferent races, which, however, proceed from the influence of climate, and the difference of nou|ri&s;hment.</P>

<P>I here give figures of a ram and ewe, of which drawings were &s;ent me by the late Mr Colin&s;on, fellow of the Royal Society of London, under the names of the <HI>Walachian ram and ewe.</HI> As this learned naturali&s;t died &s;oon afterwards, I could not di&s;cover whether the&s;e &s;heep, who&s;e horns are extremely different from tho&s;e of the ordinary kind, be common in Walachia, or whe|ther they are only an accidental variety.</P>
<P>In the northern parts of Europe, as Denmark and Norway, the &s;heep are not good; but, to improve the breed, rams are occa&s;ionally import|ed from England.

<P>THOUGH the &s;pecies of animals are &s;epa|rated from each other by an interval, which Nature cannot overleap; yet &s;ome &s;pecies ap|proach &s;o near to others, and their mutual rela|tions are &s;o numerous, that &s;pace is only left for a bare line of di&s;tinction. When we compare the&s;e neighbouring &s;pecies, and con&s;ider them in relation to our&s;elves, &s;ome appear to hold the fir&s;t rank for utility, and others &s;eem to be only auxiliary &s;pecies, which might, in many re&s;pects, &s;upply the place of the fir&s;t. Thus the a&s;s might nearly &s;upply the place of the hor&s;e, and the goat that of the &s;heep. The goat, like the &s;heep, affords both milk and &s;uet in con&s;iderable quan|tities. His hair, though coar&s;er than wool, is capable of being made into very good cloth; his &s;kin is more valuable than that of the &s;heep; and the fle&s;h of the kid makes a near approach <PB N="487" REF="499"> to that of the lamb, &amp;c. The&s;e auxiliary &s;pecies are more ru&s;tic and robu&s;t than the principals: The a&s;s and the goat require not near &s;o much attention as the hor&s;e and the &s;heep. They every where find the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, eating al|mo&s;t indi&s;criminately the gro&s;&s;e&s;t as well as the mo&s;t delicate plants. They are le&s;s affected by the influence of climate, and can better di&s;pen&s;e with the aid of man. The le&s;s they depend on us, the more they &s;eem to belong to Nature; and, in&s;tead of regarding the&s;e &s;ubaltern &s;pecies as degenerated productions of the principal &s;pe|cies, in&s;tead of con&s;idering the a&s;s as a degenera|ted hor&s;e, it would be more con&s;onant to rea&s;on, to &s;ay, that the hor&s;e is an improved a&s;s; that the &s;heep is a more delicate kind of goat, which we have trained, rai&s;ed to greater perfection, and propagated for our own u&s;e; and, in general, that the mo&s;t perfect &s;pecies, e&s;pecially among dome&s;tic animals, derive their origin from tho&s;e wild and le&s;s perfect kinds which make the near|e&s;t approach to the former. The powers of Na|ture, when united to tho&s;e of man, are greatly augmented.</P>
<P>Independent of rea&s;onings of this kind, the goat is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, and perhaps &s;till far|ther removed from the &s;heep than the a&s;s from the hor&s;e. The buck as willingly copulates with the ewe, as the jack-a&s;s with the mare; and the ram embraces the &s;he-goat in the &s;ame manner as the hor&s;e intermixes with the &s;he-a&s;s. But, <PB N="488" REF="500"> though the&s;e commixtures be frequent, and &s;ome|times prolific, no intermediate &s;pecies has been formed between the goat and &s;heep. The two &s;pecies are di&s;tinct, and &s;till remain at the &s;ame di&s;tance from each other. No change has been effected by the&s;e mixtures; they have given ri&s;e to no new or middle race of animals. They have only produced individual differences, which have no influence on the unity of each primitive &s;pe|cies, but, on the contrary, confirm the reality of their characteri&s;tic and e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es, however, we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e characteri&s;tic differences with &s;ufficient certainty: In others, we are obliged to &s;u&s;pend our judgment; and, in the greate&s;t number, we have not a &s;ingle ray of light to direct us: For, independent of the uncertainty ari&s;ing from the contradictory te&s;timonies with regard to hi&s;tori|cal facts; independent of the doubts re&s;ulting from the inaccuracy of tho&s;e who have endea|voured to &s;tudy Nature, the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to the advancement of knowledge proceeds from our ignorance of many effects which time alone has not been able to exhibit, and which will not be di&s;covered even by po&s;terity, without num|berle&s;s experiments, and the mo&s;t accurate inve|&s;tigation. In the mean time, we wander in dark|ne&s;s, perplexed between probabilities and preju|dices, ignorant even of po&s;&s;ibilities, and every moment confounding the opinions of men with the operations of Nature. Examples are innu|merable: <PB N="489" REF="501"> But, without leaving our &s;ubject, we know that the he-goat and ewe, and the ram and &s;he-goat, procreate together: We have &s;till to learn, however, whether the mules produced by the&s;e commixtures be barren or fruitful. Be|cau&s;e mules produced by the mixture of the hor&s;e with the &s;he-a&s;s, or the jack-a&s;s with the mare, are &s;terile, we conclude that mules of every kind mu&s;t likewi&s;e be deprived of the power of tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion. But this opinion may be fal&s;e. The antients a&s;&s;ert po&s;itively, that the mule produces at the age of &s;even years; and that it likewi&s;e produces with the mare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mulus &s;eptennis implere pote&s;t, et jam cum equa con|junctus hinnum procreavit; <HI>Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. animal. lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 24.</NOTE>. They tell us, that the &s;he-mule is capable of conception; but that &s;he is unable to bring her fruit to perfection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Itaque concipere aliquando mula pote&s;t, quod jam fac|tume&s;t; &s;ed enutrire atque in finem perducere non pote&s;t. Mas generare interdum pote&s;t. <HI>Id. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 6.</NOTE>. The truth of the&s;e facts, which ob&s;cure the real, di&s;tinctions of animals, as well as the theory of generation, &s;hould be either confirmed or de|&s;troyed. Be&s;ides, though we had a di&s;tinct knowledge of all the &s;pecies of animals around us, we are &s;till ignorant of what might be pro|duced by intermixture with each other, or with foreign animals. We have no proper informa|tion concerning the jumar, an animal &s;aid to be produced by the cow and jack-a&s;s, or by the mare and bull. We know not whether the ze|bra can produce with the hor&s;e or a&s;s, or the <PB N="490" REF="502"> broad-tailed Barbary ram with the common ewe; whether the chamois goat be only the common goat in a wild &s;tate, and whether an intermedi|ate race might not be formed by their mixture; whether the monkeys really differ in &s;pecies, or whether they form but one &s;pecies, diver&s;ified, like that of the dog, by a great number of dif|ferent races; whether the dog can produce with the fox and the wolf, the &s;tag with the cow, &amp;c. Our ignorance of all the&s;e facts is almo&s;t invincible; for the experiments nece&s;&s;ary to a|&s;certain them would require more time, atten|tion, and expence, than the life or fortune of mo&s;t men can permit. I employed &s;everal years in making trials of this kind, of which an ac|count &s;hall be given when I treat of mules. But, in the mean time, I acknowledge, that they af|forded me very little information, and that mo&s;t of my experiments were abortive.</P>
<P>Upon the determination of the&s;e and &s;imilar facts, however, our knowledge of the di&s;tinction of &s;pecies, and of the genuine hi&s;tory of ani|mals, as well as the manner of treating them, chiefly depends. But, &s;ince we are deprived of this nece&s;&s;ary knowledge; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible, for want of facts, to e&s;tabli&s;h analogies, or to lay a proper foundation for rea&s;oning, there is no other method left us, than to proceed, &s;tep by &s;tep, to con&s;ider each animal individually, to regard as different &s;pecies all tho&s;e which &s;pontaneou&s;ly procreate together, and to write their hi&s;tory in <PB N="491" REF="503"> detached articles; re&s;erving a power of uniting or &s;eparating them, as &s;oon as we &s;hall acquire a more perfect knowledge, either from our own experience, or that of other men.</P>
<P>It is for this rea&s;on, that, though there are many animals which re&s;emble the &s;heep and goat, we here confine our&s;elves entirely to the dome|&s;tic kinds. We know not whether the foreign kinds could intermix with the common &s;pecies, and produce new races. We are, therefore, au|thori&s;ed to con&s;ider them as di&s;tinct &s;pecies, till &s;ufficient evidence is procured, that the foreign kinds can procreate with the common, and pro|duce fertile individuals: This is the only cha|racter which con&s;titutes the reality of what is called <HI>&s;pecies</HI> both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</P>
<P>The goat is &s;uperior to the &s;heep both in &s;en|timent and dexterity. He approaches man &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and is ea&s;ily familiarized. He is &s;en&s;ible of care&s;&s;es, and capable of a con&s;iderable degree of attachment. He is &s;tronger, lighter, more agile, and le&s;s timid than the &s;heep. He is a &s;prightly, capricious, wandering, la&s;civious ani|mal. It is with difficulty that he can be confined to a flock. He loves to retire into &s;olitude, to climb &s;teep and rugged places, to &s;tand and even to &s;leep on the points of rocks, and the edges of the mo&s;t frightful precipices. The female anxiou&s;ly &s;earches for the male; and they unite with ar|dour. They are robu&s;t and ea&s;ily nouri&s;hed; <PB N="492" REF="504"> for they eat almo&s;t every herb, and are injured by a very incon&s;iderable number. The bodily temperament of the goat, which, in all animals, has a great influence on the natural di&s;po&s;itions, is not e&s;&s;entially different from that of the &s;heep. The&s;e two animals, who&s;e internal organization is almo&s;t entirely &s;imilar, are nouri&s;hed, grow, and multiply in the &s;ame manner; and their di&s;ea&s;es are the &s;ame, excepting a few to which the goat is not &s;ubject. The goat fears not, like the &s;heep, too great a degree of heat. He chear|fully expo&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;un, and &s;leeps un|der his mo&s;t ardent rays, without being affected with a vertigo, or any other inconveniency. He is not afraid of rain or &s;torms; but he appears to feel the effects of &s;evere cold. The external actions and movements of animals, which, as formerly remarked, depend more upon the &s;trength and variety of their &s;en&s;ations, than the &s;tructure of their bodies, are, for this rea&s;on, more vivacious, and le&s;s limited in the goat than in the &s;heep. The incon&s;tancy of the goat's di&s;|po&s;ition is marked by the irregularity of his actions. He walks, &s;tops &s;hort, runs, leaps, ap|proaches, retires, &s;hows, and conceals him&s;elf, or flies off, as if he were actuated by mere caprice, and without any other cau&s;e than what ari&s;es from an excentric vivacity of temper. The &s;upplene&s;s of his organs, and the &s;trength and nervou&s;ne&s;s of his frame, are hardly &s;ufficient to <PB N="493" REF="505"> &s;upport the petulance and rapidity of his natural movements.</P>
<P>That the&s;e animals are naturally friends to man, and that, even in uninhabited countries, they betray no &s;avage di&s;po&s;itions, is apparent from the following fact. In the year 1698, an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el having put into the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta, two Negroes came aboard, and offered
<HI>gratis</HI> to the captain as many goats as he plea|&s;ed. The captain having expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;h|ment at this offer, the Negroes replied, that there were only twelve per&s;ons on the i&s;land; that the goats had multiplied &s;o greatly as to become extremely trouble&s;ome; and that, in|&s;tead of being caught with difficulty, they ob&s;ti|nately followed the men, like other dome&s;tic animals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 1. p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The male is in a capacity of engendering when he is a year old, and the female when &s;he is &s;even months. But the fruits of &s;uch prema|ture embraces are feeble and imperfect; and, for this rea&s;on, they are generally re&s;trained till they arrive at the age of eighteen months or two years. The he-goat is a beautiful, vigorous, and ardent animal. In the cour&s;e of two or three months, one male is &s;ufficient for more than 150 females. But this ardour, which &s;oon con|&s;umes him, la&s;ts only three or four years; and, at the age of five or &s;ix, he is old and enerva|ted. Hence, a male for breeding &s;hould be <PB N="494" REF="506"> large, hand&s;ome, and not exceeding two years of age. His neck &s;hould be &s;hort and fle&s;hy; his head light; his ears pendent; his thighs thick; his limbs firm; his hair black, thick, and &s;oft; and his beard long and bu&s;hy. The choice of the female is not of equal importance. It may only be remarked, that tho&s;e which have large bodies, thick thighs, a light walk, long and capacious udders, and &s;oft bu&s;hy hair, ought to be preferred. The females are in &s;ea&s;on du|ring the months of September, October, and November: But, when allowed to approach the male, they are willing to receive him, and are capable of producing, in all &s;ea&s;ons. They, however, hold much &s;urer in autumn; and the months of October and November are preferred; becau&s;e the young kids are brought forth when the gra&s;s is tender. They go with young about five months, and are delivered in the beginning of the &s;ixth. They &s;uckle their young a month or &s;ix weeks. Thus, &s;ix months and a half &s;hould be reckoned between the time when they are covered, and that when the kid begins to feed upon pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>When pa&s;tured along with &s;heep, the goats always take the lead of the flock. They love to feed &s;eparately upon the tops of hills, and prefer the mo&s;t elevated and rugged parts of mountains. They find &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment in heathy, barren, and uncultivated grounds. They do infinite mi&s;chief when permitted to go <PB N="495" REF="507"> among corn, vines, cop&s;es, or young plantations; for they eat with avidity the tender bark and young &s;hoots of trees, which generally proves fatal to their growth. They carefully avoid moi&s;t ground, mar&s;hy meadows, and rich pa&s;|tures. They are &s;eldom reared in plain coun|tries, where they never thrive, and where their fle&s;h is always bad. Va&s;t quantities are reared in warm climates; and they are never put into &s;tables. In France, they would peri&s;h, if not &s;heltered during winter. They require no lit|ter in &s;ummer; but, in winter, as moi&s;ture is very hurtful to them, they &s;hould be frequently &s;upplied with fre&s;h litter, and never allowed to lie upon their own dung. They are conducted to the fields very early in the morning, gra&s;s covered with dew, which is injurious to &s;heep, being extremely &s;alutary to goats. As they are untractable and wandering animals, one man, however robu&s;t and active, is unable to manage above fifty of them. They are never permitted to go out during &s;now or hoar-fro&s;t; but are fed in the &s;table with herbage, &s;mall branches of trees collected in autumn, cabbages, turnips, and other roots. The more they eat, the quan|tity of their milk is the greater. To increa&s;e the quantity of milk &s;till more, they are made to drink much, by mixing a little nitre or &s;alt with their water. The milk may be drawn from them five days after bringing forth; and they continue to yield con&s;iderable quantities of <PB N="496" REF="508"> it every morning and evening, for four or five months. The female produces but one kid, though &s;ometimes two, &s;eldom three, and never more than four. She is fertile from one year or eighteen months, till &s;he be &s;even years of age. The male may propagate as long, and perhaps longer, if he were properly managed; but he is &s;eldom employed above five years. He is then &s;ent to be fattened among the old and young male goats, which have been ca&s;tra|ted, to render their fle&s;h more tender and &s;uc|culent. The&s;e are fattened in the &s;ame manner as wedders. But, whatever attention is be&s;tow|ed on them, or however they are fed, their fle&s;h is never &s;o good as mutton, excepting in very warm climates, where mutton is always ill ta|&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;trong odour of the he-goat proceeds not from his fle&s;h, but from his &s;kin. The&s;e ani|mals, which are not permitted to grow old, might perhaps live ten or twelve years. When|ever they cea&s;e to multiply, they are killed; and the older they are, their fle&s;h is the wor&s;e. Both males and females, with very few excep|tions, are furni&s;hed with horns. The colour of their hair is exceedingly various. It is &s;aid, that tho&s;e which are white, and have no horns, give mo&s;t milk; and that the black goats are the &s;tronge&s;t. Though the food of tho&s;e animals co&s;ts almo&s;t nothing, yet they fail not to bring con&s;iderable profit. Their fle&s;h, tallow, hair, <PB N="497" REF="509"> and &s;kin are valuable commodities. Their milk is more whole&s;ome and better than that of the &s;heep: It is u&s;ed as a medicine, curdles ea&s;ily, and makes very good chee&s;e. As it contains only few oily particles, the cream &s;hould never be &s;eparated from it. The females allow them|&s;elves to be &s;ucked by infants, to whom their milk affords very good nouri&s;hment. Like cows and &s;heep, they are &s;ucked by the <HI>viper,</HI> and &s;till more by a bird called the <HI>goat-&s;ucker,</HI> which fixes on their paps during the night, and, it is &s;aid, makes them lo&s;e their milk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the viper &s;ucks cows, &s;heep, and goats, has all the appearances of a vulgar error; and &s;hould not, therefore, have been related &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, unle&s;s the author could have &s;upported what he advances with the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable facts. As to, the goat-&s;ucker, though it has been blamed for this practice by mo&s;t naturali&s;ts; yet I am convinced, that the accu&s;ation has not the &s;malle&s;t foundation in truth. This bird, which feeds upon moths, flies, and other in&s;ects, has indeed the power of o|pening its mouth to an uncommon width. But nothing can be more oppo&s;ite to the &s;tructure of parts nece&s;&s;ary for the opera|tion of &s;ucking, than the bill of a bird. The frequent atten|dance of tho&s;e birds upon cattle of all kinds has probably given ri&s;e to this ridiculous notion. They attend cattle, not to &s;uck them, but to &s;eize the flies and other in&s;ects which perpetually a&s;&s;emble about the&s;e animals. This rea&s;oning will acquire ad|ditional force, when it is con&s;idered, that the goat-&s;ucker at|tends males as con&s;tantly as females.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The goat has no cutting teeth in the upper jaw. Tho&s;e of the under jaw fall out, and are replaced in the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame or|der, as the teeth of the &s;heep. The age of the goat is indicated by the teeth and the knobs of the horns. The number of teeth in the &s;he-goat <PB N="498" REF="510"> is not uniform: They are generally few-|er than tho&s;e of the male, who&s;e hair is al&s;o more rude, and his beard and horns longer. The&s;e animals, like the ox and &s;heep, have four &s;tomachs, and chew the cud. Their &s;pecies is more univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed than that of the &s;heep. Goats, every way &s;imilar to our own, are found in many parts of the world. They are only &s;maller in Guiney and other warm climates, and larger in Mu&s;covy and other northern regions. The goats of Angora, or of Syria, with pendent ears, are of the &s;ame &s;pecies with ours; for they intermix together, and produce even in our climates. The horns of the male are equally long with tho&s;e of the common kind; but they are directed and contorted in a different man|ner. They extend horizontally from each &s;ide of the head, and form &s;pirals nearly like tho&s;e of a &s;crew. The horns of the female are &s;hort, bend backwards, downwards, and then advance forwards, &s;o as to terminate near the eyes; but their direction and contour are not always uni|form. The pre&s;ent de&s;cription was taken from a male and female in the royal menage. Like mo&s;t-Syrian animals, their hair was very long and bu&s;hy, and &s;o fine, that cloths, as beautiful and glo&s;&s;y as &s;ilken &s;tuffs, are made of it.</P>

<P>I HAVE joined the&s;e three animals, becau&s;e they form but one &s;pecies. The one is the wild animal, the other two are the &s;ame ani|mal, only in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. Though they differ in &s;ome external marks, and perhaps like|wi&s;e in &s;ome habits; yet, as the&s;e differences are not e&s;&s;ential, but relative to their condition, as their nature is not altered by their &s;lavery, and, la&s;tly, as they can produce, by intermix|ture, <PB N="501" REF="517"> fertile individuals, the only character which con&s;titutes a di&s;tinct and permanent &s;pecies, they ought not to be treated as &s;eparate animals.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are remarkably &s;ingular: Their &s;pecies is &s;olitary and detached. It is approach|ed by no neighbouring &s;pecies, which, like that of the hor&s;e and a&s;s, and of the &s;heep and goat, may be regarded as principal or as acce&s;&s;ory. Neither is it &s;ubject to a variety of races, like that of the dog. It participates of &s;everal &s;pecies; but differs e&s;&s;entially from the whole. Let tho&s;e who wi&s;h to limit the immen&s;ity of Nature to the contracted views of imperfect &s;y&s;tems, attend to this animal, and they will di&s;cover, that it eludes all their methodical arrangements. Its extremi|ties, which are <HI>cloven-hoofed,</HI> have no re&s;em|blance to tho&s;e that are <HI>whole-hoofed.</HI> It even re&s;embles not the <HI>cloven-hoofed</HI> animals; be|cau&s;e, though it appears to have only two toes, it has actually four concealed within. It has no re&s;emblance to the <HI>digitated</HI> quadrupeds; becau&s;e it walks only on two toes, and the other two are neither &s;o &s;ituated, nor extended &s;o far, as to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of walking. It has, therefore, equivocal or ambiguous characters, of which &s;ome are apparent and others concealed. Shall we con&s;ider this as an error of Nature, and maintain that the two internal toes &s;hould not be reckoned? But this error is con&s;tant. Be&s;ides, in this animal, the other bones of the foot have no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of cloven-footed ani|mals; <PB N="502" REF="518"> and there are other differences &s;till more &s;triking: For the latter have horns and no teeth in the upper jaw; they have four &s;tomachs, chew the cud, &amp;c. But the hog has no horns, only one &s;tomach, does not ruminate, and has cutting teeth both above and below. It is evi|dent, therefore, that he belongs neither to the genus of whole-hoofed, nor to that of cloven-hoofed. He has as little preten&s;ion to be rank|ed with the digitated quadrupeds; for he differs from them not only in the extremity of his foot, but &s;till more in his teeth, &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, internal parts of generation, &amp;c. All that can be &s;aid is, that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, he forms the link between the whole and cloven-footed ani|mals, and, in others, between the cloven-footed and digitated animals; for, in the number and arrangement of his teeth, he differs le&s;s from the whole-hoofed quadrupeds than from the other kinds. He al&s;o re&s;embles them in the prolon|gation of the jaws, and, like them, he has but one large &s;tomach; but, by an appendix attached to it, as well as by the po&s;ition of the inte&s;tines, he &s;eems to approach towards the cloven-footed or ruminant animals. He likewi&s;e re&s;embles them in the external parts of generation; and, at the &s;ame time, he re&s;embles the digitated quadrupeds in the form of his legs, in the habit of his body, and in the number of his progeny. Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quadrupedum autem, quac &s;anguine con&s;tant, eadem quae animal generant, alia multifida &s;unt; quales hominis ma|nus pede&s;que habentur.

But the only rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns is, that, in Illyrica, Poeonia, and &s;ome other places, there are whole-hoofed hogs. This animal &s;till affords a kind of exception to two general laws of nature, namely, that the larger the animals, they are the le&s;s prolific; and that digitated animals are the mo&s;t prolific. The hog, though of a &s;ize far beyond mediocrity, produces more than any other quadruped. By this &s;urpri&s;ing fecundity, as well as by the &s;truc|ture of the ovaria of the female, it &s;eems to con|&s;titute the extremity of the viviparous &s;pecies, and to approach to tho&s;e of the oviparous. In fine, the hog &s;eems to be of an equivocal nature, or rather he appears &s;o to tho&s;e who mi&s;take the hypothetical arrangement of their ideas for the common order of Nature, and who only per|ceive, in the infinite chain of being, &s;ome con|&s;picuous points to which they incline to refer every natural phaenomenon.</P>
<P>To circum&s;cribe the &s;phere of Nature, is not the proper method of acquiring the knowledge <PB N="504" REF="520"> of her. We cannot judge of her, by making her act agreeably to our particular and limited views. We can never enter deeply into the de|&s;igns of the author of Nature, by a&s;cribing to him our own ideas. In&s;tead of limiting the powers of Nature, we ought to enlarge and ex|tend them; we &s;hould regard nothing as im|po&s;&s;ible, but believe that every thing which can have exi&s;tence, really exi&s;ts. Ambiguous &s;pecies, and irregular productions, would not then excite &s;urpri&s;e, but appear to be equally nece&s;&s;ary as o|thers, in the infinite order of things. They fill the intervals, and con&s;titute the intermediate points of the chain. The&s;e beings pre&s;ent to the hu|man intellect, curious examples, where Nature, by appearing to act upon an unu&s;ual model, makes a greater di&s;play of her powers, and af|fords us an opportunity of recogni&s;ing &s;ingular characters, which indicate that her de&s;igns are more general than our contracted views, and that, if &s;he has made nothing in vain, neither are her operations regulated by the de&s;igns which we attribute to her.</P>
<P>Does not this &s;ingular conformation of the hog merit a few reflections? He appears not to have been con&s;tructed upon any original or per|fect model; for he is a compo&s;ition of different animals. Some of his parts, for example, the toes above de&s;cribed, the bones of which are per|fectly formed, are evidently of no u&s;e to him. Nature, therefore, in the con&s;truction of beings, <PB N="505" REF="521"> is by no means &s;ubjected to the influence of fi|nal cau&s;es. Why &s;hould &s;he not &s;ometimes give redundant parts, when &s;he &s;o often denies tho&s;e which are e&s;&s;ential? How many animals are de|prived of &s;en&s;es and of members? Why &s;hould we imagine, that, in each individual, every part is u&s;eful to its neighbour, and nece&s;&s;ary to the whole? Is it not enough that they exi&s;t toge|ther, that they never injure each other, that they can grow and expand without mutual de&s;truc|tion? Every thing which is not &s;o ho&s;tile as to de&s;troy, every thing that can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in connec|tion with other things, does actually &s;ub&s;i&s;t: And, perhaps, in mo&s;t beings, there are fewer relative, u&s;eful, or nece&s;&s;ary parts, than tho&s;e which are indifferent, u&s;ele&s;s, or redundant. But, as we always wi&s;h to make every thing refer to a certain end, when parts have no apparent u&s;es, we either &s;uppo&s;e that their u&s;es are concealed from us, or invent relations which have no ex|i&s;tence, and tend only to throw an ob&s;cure veil over the operations of Nature. It is the inten|tion of true philo&s;ophy, to in&s;truct us <HI>how</HI> ob|jects exi&s;t, and the manner in which Nature acts: But we pervert this intention, by attempting to inve&s;tigate <HI>why</HI> objects are produced, and the ends propo&s;ed by Nature in producing them.</P>
<P>This general and pre&s;umptuous prejudice, which &s;erves only to conceal our ignorance, is both u&s;ele&s;s, and prevents the di&s;covery of natu|ral truths. Without deviating from our &s;ubject, <PB N="506" REF="522"> &s;ome examples may be given where tho&s;e in|tentions, which we &s;o arrogantly a&s;cribe to Na|ture, are evidently fal&s;e and contradictory. The phalanges of the hand or foot are &s;aid to be formed for the purpo&s;es of producing fingers and toes; yet, in the hog, the phalanges are u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e they give ri&s;e to no toes which benefit the animal; and cloven-hoofed animals have &s;mall bones in their feet, which do not e|ven form phalanges. Hence, if Nature intend|ed to produce toes in the&s;e animals, it is evident, that, in the hog, &s;he has only half-executed her de&s;ign, and, in the others, that &s;he has hardly begun it.</P>
<P>The allantois is a membrane accompanying the foetus of the &s;ow, the mare, the cow, and &s;everal other animals. As this membrane ad|heres to the bladder of the foetus, it was &s;aid to be de&s;tined for the reception of the urine di&s;|charged during the time of ge&s;tation. At the in&s;tant of birth, an incon&s;iderable quantity of li|quor is found in the allantois. In the cow this liquor is perhaps mo&s;t abundant; and yet the allantois contains only a few pints: The capa|city of the membrane is here &s;o great, that no proportion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between it and the liquor. This membrane, when filled with air, forms a double bag in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent, about thir|teen or fourteen feet long, by nine, ten, eleven, and &s;ometimes twelve broad. Is a ve&s;&s;el, capable of containing &s;everal cubic feet, nece&s;&s;ary for the <PB N="507" REF="523"> reception of three or four pints of fluid? The bladder of the foetus, if not pierced at the bot|tom, would it&s;elf be &s;ufficient to contain this quantity, as it does in man and other animals, in which no allantois has hitherto been di&s;co|vered. Hence this membrane is not de&s;igned for receiving the urine of the foetus, nor for any purpo&s;e that we can a&s;cribe to it; for, if it were filled, as, according to our mode of rea&s;on|ing, it ought &s;ometimes to be filled, it would be as large as the body of the mother. Be&s;ides, as it bur&s;ts at the moment of birth, and is thrown away along with the other membranes which inve&s;t the foetus, it is equally u&s;ele&s;s then as it was before.</P>
<P>The number of paps, in every &s;pecies of ani|mals, it has been &s;aid, is proportioned to the number of young which the female is capable of producing and &s;uckling. But why &s;hould the male, who never produces, have generally the &s;ame number of paps? And why &s;hould the &s;ow, which often produces eighteen, and even twenty pigs, have only twelve paps, and &s;ome|times fewer? Does not this prove that the ope|rations of Nature are not to be judged of by final cau&s;es, or moral fitne&s;s, but by examining the manner in which &s;he acts, and by employing, to acquire a knowledge of her, all tho&s;e phy&s;ical relations exhibited to us by the immen&s;e variety of her productions. I allow, that this method, which is the only path that can conduct us to <PB N="508" REF="524"> real knowledge, is incomparably more difficult than the other, and that there are innumerable facts in Nature, to which, like the preceding, it cannot be applied with &s;ucce&s;s. However, in|&s;tead of &s;earching for the u&s;e of this great ca|pacity in the allantois, and finding that it neither &s;erves, nor can &s;erve, any purpo&s;e, we ought to inquire into tho&s;e phy&s;ical relations which may indicate the origin of its production. By ob|&s;erving, for example, that, in animals who&s;e &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are not very large, the allantois is either very &s;mall, or does not exi&s;t; and that, con&s;equently, the production of this membrane has &s;ome connection with the great capacity of the inte&s;tines, &amp;c. In the &s;ame man|ner, by con&s;idering, that the number of paps is not equal to the number of young, admitting only the mo&s;t prolific animals to have the great|e&s;t number of paps, we may conjecture, that this numerous production depends on the confor|mation of the internal parts of generation, and that the paps, depending al&s;o externally on the &s;ame parts, there is, between the number or ar|rangement of the&s;e parts, and that of the paps, a phy&s;ical relation which ought to be inve&s;ti|gated.</P>
<P>But I only point out the true path, this not being a proper place for pro&s;ecuting &s;uch nice di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. However, I mu&s;t remark, that nu|merous productions depend more upon the &s;truc|ture of the internal parts of generation than any other cau&s;e: They depend not upon the quan|tity <PB N="509" REF="525"> of &s;eminal fluid, otherwi&s;e the hor&s;e, the &s;tag, the ram, and the goat, would be more pro|lific than the dog, the cat, and other animals which &s;ecrete le&s;s &s;emen in proportion to their &s;ize. But the prolific powers of the latter far exceed tho&s;e of the former. Neither does the number of young depend upon the frequency of coition; for, in the &s;ow and bitch, one em|brace is &s;ufficient for the production of a nume|rous progeny. The longer or &s;horter time oc|cupied in di&s;charging the &s;emen, &s;eems likewi&s;e to have no influence on the number of young; for the dog remains long only in con&s;equence of an ob&s;tacle ari&s;ing from the &s;tructure of the parts; and, though the boar is retained by no &s;uch ob&s;tacle, and continues longer than mo&s;t animals; yet no conclu&s;ion can be drawn from this circum&s;tance in favour of a numerous pro|geny, &s;ince the cock requires but an in&s;tant to impregnate all the eggs which a hen can pro|duce in the cour&s;e of a month. I &s;hall after|wards unfold the ideas I have here accumulated, &s;olely with a view to demon&s;trate, that a &s;imple probability, or conjecture, when founded on phy&s;ical relations, brings more light and greater advantages than the whole group of final cau&s;es put together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is another bold and inconclu&s;ive attack upon final cau&s;es. See the note vol. II. p. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the peculiarities already related, &s;ome o|thers remain to be added. The fat of the hog differs from that of almo&s;t every other quadru|ped, <PB N="510" REF="526"> not only in its con&s;i&s;tence and quality, but in its po&s;ition in the body of the animal. The fat of man, and of tho&s;e animals which have no &s;uet, as the dog, the hor&s;e, &amp;c. is pretty equal|ly intermixed with the fle&s;h. The &s;uet of the &s;heep, goat, deer, &amp;c. is placed at the extremities of the fle&s;h. But the lard of the hog is neither mixed with the fle&s;h, nor collected at its extre|mities. It covers the whole animal in the form of a thick, di&s;tinct, and continued &s;tratum be|tween the fle&s;h and the &s;kin. This phaenome|non likewi&s;e takes place in the whale and other cetaceous animals.</P>
<P>What is &s;till more &s;ingular, the hog &s;heds not his fore-teeth; they continue to grow during life. He has &s;ix cutting teeth in the under jaw, and a corre&s;ponding number in the upper. But, by an irregularity, of which there is not another example in Nature, the figure of the &s;ix teeth in the under jaw is different from that of tho&s;e in the upper; for, in&s;tead of being &s;harp and cutting, the latter are long, cylindrical, blunt at the points, and form nearly a right angle with tho&s;e in the upper jaw; &s;o that their extremities apply to each other in a very oblique manner.</P>
<P>Tu&s;ks, or very long canine teeth, are peculiar to the hog, and two or three other &s;pecies of animals. They differ from other teeth, by ex|tending out of the mouth, and continuing to grow during life. In the elephant and &s;ea-cow, <PB N="511" REF="527"> they are cylindrical, and &s;everal feet in length. In the wild boar and male hog, I have &s;een the tu&s;ks from nine to ten inches long. They are flat, &s;harp, and bend in a circular form. They &s;ink very deep in the &s;ocket; and, like tho&s;e of the elephant, they have a cavity at their &s;uperior extremity. The tu&s;ks of the ele|phant and &s;ea-cow are placed in the upper jaw, and there are no canine teeth in the under jaw. But the male hog and wild boar have tu&s;ks in both jaws; and tho&s;e of the under jaw are mo&s;t u&s;eful to the animal, and al&s;o mo&s;t dangerous; for it is with them that the wild boar wounds tho&s;e who attack him.</P>
<P>The common &s;ow, the wild &s;ow, and the ca|&s;trated dome&s;tic boar, have likewi&s;e four canine teeth in the under jaw; but they are much le&s;s than tho&s;e of the male, and never extend be|yond the mouth. Be&s;ide the&s;e &s;ixteen teeth, namely, twelve cutting and four canine, they have twenty-eight grinders, which make forty-four in all. The tu&s;ks of the wild boar are lar|ger, his &s;nout &s;tronger, and his head longer than tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic hog. His feet are al&s;o larger, his toes more &s;eparated, and his bri&s;tles is always black.</P>
<P>Of all quadrupeds, the hog is the mo&s;t rude and brutal. The imperfections of his form &s;eem to have an influence on his nature and di&s;|po&s;itions. All his habits are gro&s;s; all his ap|petites are impure; all his &s;en&s;ations are confi|ned <PB N="512" REF="528"> to a furious lu&s;t, and a brutal gluttony. He devours indi&s;criminately every thing that comes in his way, even his own progeny, the moment after their birth. This voraciou&s;ne&s;s &s;eems to proceed from the perpetual cravings of his &s;tomach, which is of an immoderate &s;ize; and the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his appetites, it is probable, ari&s;es from the bluntne&s;s of his &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and of feeling. The rudene&s;s of the hair, the hardne&s;s of the &s;kin, and the thickne&s;s of the fat, render the&s;e animals le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to blows. Mice have been known to lodge upon a hog's back, to eat his &s;kin and his fat, without his &s;howing any marks of &s;en&s;ibility. The o|ther &s;en&s;es of the hog are very good. It is well known to the hunters, that the wild boar hears and &s;mells at a great di&s;tance; for, in or|der to &s;urpri&s;e him, they are obliged to watch him in &s;ilence during the night, and to place them&s;elves oppo&s;ite to the wind, that he may not perceive the &s;mell, which never fails to make him turn back.</P>
<P>The imperfection of the &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and feeling in the hog, is farther augmented by a le|prous di&s;ea&s;e, which renders him almo&s;t totally in&s;en&s;ible. This malady proceeds, perhaps, le&s;s from the texture of the fle&s;h or &s;kin, than from the natural dirtine&s;s of the animal, and the cor|ruption that mu&s;t re&s;ult from the putrid food he &s;ometimes devours; for the wild boar, who generally lives upon grain, fruits, acorns, and <PB N="513" REF="529"> roots, is not &s;ubject to this di&s;temper; neither is the pig while it continues to &s;uck. There is no method of preventing it, but by keeping the dome&s;tic hog in a clean &s;table, and feeding him with whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment. His fle&s;h will become excellent, and his fat firm and brittle, if he is kept for fifteen days or three weeks in a paved &s;table, without litter, and always clean, giving him only dry wheat to eat, and allowing him to drink very little. For this purpo&s;e, a
<HI>hog</HI> of a year old, in good health, and half-fat|tened, &s;hould be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The ordinary method of fattening <HI>hogs</HI> is to give them plenty of barley, acorns, cabbages, boiled peas, roots, &amp;c. and water mixed with bran. In two months they are fat; their lard is thick, but neither firm nor white; and their fle&s;h, though good, is &s;omewhat in&s;ipid. They may be fattened much cheaper in woody coun|tries, which produce acorns, and other nuts, by leading them into the fore&s;ts during au|tumn, when che&s;nuts, acorns, beech-ma&s;t, &amp;c. fall and quit their hu&s;ks. They eat indi&s;crimi|nately all wild fruits, and &s;oon fatten, e&s;pecial|ly if, on their return in the evening, they be &s;erved with lukewarm water mixed with a little bran and pea&s;e-meal. This drink makes them &s;leep, and take on fat to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;ometimes are unable to walk, or move them|&s;elves. They fatten much &s;ooner in autumn than in any other &s;ea&s;on, both becau&s;e their <PB N="514" REF="530"> food is more plentiful, and becau&s;e they lo&s;e le&s;s by per&s;piration than in the &s;ummer months.</P>
<P>In fattening <HI>hogs,</HI> it is unnece&s;&s;ary to delay, as we do with other cattle, till they be full grown; for, the older they are, they fatten with more difficulty, and their fle&s;h is not equally good. Ca&s;tration, which ought always to pre|cede the fattening of <HI>hogs,</HI> is generally perform|ed at the age of &s;ix months, and in the &s;pring or autumn; becau&s;e great heat or great cold renders the wound dangerous or difficult to cure; for the operation is commonly performed by in|ci&s;ion, though &s;ometimes by a &s;imple ligature. When ca&s;trated in &s;pring, they are fattened the following autumn, and are &s;eldom allowed to live two years. However, they continue to grow during the &s;econd, third, fourth, and even the fifth year. Tho&s;e which are remarkable for their &s;ize and corpulence, are too old, and have been &s;everal times fed in the fore&s;t. The continuance of their growth &s;eems not to be li|mited to four or five years. The boars kept for propagation grow larger during the &s;ixth year; and the wild boar is larger and fatter, in proportion to the number of his years.</P>
<P>The life of the wild boar may be extended to twenty-five or thirty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See La Venerie de du Fouilloux, p. 57.</NOTE>. Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that hogs in general live twenty years; and adds, that both males and females are fertile till they arrive at the age of fifteen. They can en|gender <PB N="515" REF="531"> at the age of nine or twelve months; but it is better to re&s;train them till they be eighteen months or two years. The fir&s;t litter of the &s;ow is not numerous; and, when only one year old, her pigs are weak, and even imperfect. She may be &s;aid to be in &s;ea&s;on at all times. Though full, &s;he &s;olicits the approach of the male. This may be regarded as an exce&s;s among animals; for almo&s;t every other &s;pecies refu&s;e the male after conception. The ardour of the &s;ow, though almo&s;t perpetual, is, however, marked by pa|roxy&s;ms and immoderate movements, which al|ways terminate by her wallowing in the mire. She, at the &s;ame time, emits a thick whiti&s;h fluid. She goes four months with young, brings forth in the beginning of the fifth; and &s;oon afterwards &s;olicits the male, is impregnated a &s;econd time, and, of cour&s;e, brings forth twice a-year. The wild &s;ow, which every way re&s;embles the dome&s;tic kind, produces only once a-year. This differ|ence in fertility is probably owing to want of nouri&s;hment, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uckling her pigs much longer than the dome&s;tic &s;ow, which is never allowed to nur&s;e her young above fifteen days or three weeks. Only eight or nine of the litter are kept longer; the re&s;t are &s;old. In fif|teen days, pigs are excellent food. As many females are unnece&s;&s;ary, and as ca&s;trated hogs bring mo&s;t profit, their fle&s;h being be&s;t, only two females, and &s;even or eight males, are left with the mother.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="532"> The male cho&s;en for propagation &s;hould have a thick body, rather &s;quare than long, a large head, a &s;hort flat &s;nout, large depending ears, &s;mall fiery eyes, a large thick neck, a flat belly, broad thighs, thick, &s;hort legs, and &s;trong, black bri&s;tles. White hogs are never &s;o &s;trong as the black kind. The &s;ow ought to have a long body, a large belly, and long dugs. She &s;hould al&s;o be of a placid temper, and &s;prung from a proli|fic race. Immediately after conception, &s;he &s;hould be &s;eparated from the male, who is apt to injure her. When &s;he brings forth, &s;he &s;hould be fed plentifully, and watched to prevent her from devouring &s;ome of her young. Still great|er attention is nece&s;&s;ary to keep off the male, who would de&s;troy the whole litter. The fe|males are covered in the beginning of &s;pring, that the pigs may be brought forth in &s;ummer, and have time to acquire &s;trength and become fat before winter. But, when two litters are wanted annually, the male is given in Novem|ber, that the female may bring forth in March; and &s;he is covered a &s;econd time in the begin|ning of May. Some &s;ows produce regularly every five months. The wild &s;ow, which pro|duces but once a-year, receives the male in Ja|nuary or February, and brings forth in May or June. She &s;uckles her young three or four months: She conducts, follows, and allows them not to &s;eparate from her till they be two or three years old; and it is not uncommon to &s;ee a <PB N="517" REF="533"> wild &s;ow accompanied with two or three litters. The dome&s;tic &s;ow is not allowed to &s;uckle her pigs above two months. At the end of three weeks, they are led to the fields along with the mother, to accu&s;tom them gradually to feed as &s;he does. Five weeks afterwards, they are weaned, and get, every morning and evening, a little milk mixed with bran, or only lukewarm water and boiled vegetables.</P>
<P>Hogs are fond of earth-worms and particular roots, as tho&s;e of the wild carrot. It is in &s;earch of the&s;e worms and roots, that they dig the ground with their &s;nouts. The wild boar, who&s;e &s;nout is longer and &s;tronger than that of the do|me&s;tic kind, digs deeper, and always nearly in a &s;traight line: But the common hog digs ir|regularly and more lightly. As they do much mi&s;chief in cultivated fields, they &s;hould be fed in the fore&s;ts, or in fallow land.</P>
<P>Wild boars, which have not pa&s;&s;ed their third year, are called by the hunters <HI>flock-bea&s;ts</HI> (b&ecirc;tes de compagnie); becau&s;e, previous to this age, they do not &s;eparate, but follow their common mother. They never wander alone, till they have acquired &s;trength &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the at|tacks of the wolf. The&s;e animals, when they have young, form a kind of flocks; and it is upon this alone that their &s;afety depends. When attacked, the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t front the e|nemy, and, by pre&s;&s;ing all round again&s;t the weaker, force them into the centre. The do|me&s;tic <PB N="518" REF="534"> hogs defend them&s;elves in the &s;ame man|ner, and have no occa&s;ion to be guarded by dogs. But, as they are ob&s;tinate and untractable, an active and robu&s;t man is unable to manage more than fifty of them. In autumn and winter, they are conducted to the woods, where wild fruits abound; in &s;ummer, they are led to moi&s;t grounds, where they find plenty of worms and roots; and, in &s;pring, they are allowed to go on wa&s;te or fallow lands. They are led out twice a-day from March to October, and feed from the time that the dew is di&s;&s;ipated in the morning, till ten o'clock, and from two in the afternoon till the evening. In winter, they are let out only once a-day, when the weather is fine; for dew, &s;now, and rain, are hurtful to them. When overtaken with a &s;torm, or even a great rain, they often de&s;ert the flock one after another, and run and cry till they arrive at the &s;table-door. The younge&s;t cry oftene&s;t, and loude&s;t. This cry, which differs from the ordinary grunt|ing, re&s;embles the cries they utter when bound with ropes, in order to be &s;laughtered. The male cries le&s;s frequently than the female. The wild boar &s;eldom cries, unle&s;s when he is wounded in combat. The wild &s;ow cries oftener; and, when &s;uddenly frighted, &s;he blows with &s;uch violence as to be heard at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Though extremely gluttonous, they never at|tack or devour other animals; but they &s;ome|times eat putrid fle&s;h. Wild boars have been <PB N="519" REF="535"> ob&s;erved eating the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, and the &s;kin of the roebuck, and claws of birds have been found in their &s;tomachs. But, perhaps, this proceeds more from nece&s;&s;ity than in&s;tinct. It cannot, however, be denied, that they are very fond of blood, and of fre&s;h and bloody fle&s;h; for hogs devour their own young, and even in|fants in the cradle. Whenever they find any &s;ucculent, moi&s;t, or unctuous &s;ub&s;tance, they fir&s;t lick, and then &s;wallow it. In their return from the fields, I have &s;een a whole herd &s;top round a piece of new ploughed clay-land, which, though but &s;lightly unctuous, they all licked, and &s;ome of them &s;wallowed con&s;iderable quantities of it. Their gluttony, as formerly remarked, is equally gro&s;s as their nature is brutal. They have no &s;entiments which are very di&s;tinct. The pigs hardly know their mother, or, at lea&s;t, they are extremely apt to mi&s;take her, and to &s;uck the fir&s;t &s;ow that will permit them. Fear and ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;eem to confer more &s;entiment and in|&s;tinct upon wild hogs. The young are more attached to their mother, and &s;he appears to be more attentive to them, than the dome&s;tic &s;ow. In the rutting &s;ea&s;on, the male follows the fe|male, and generally remains with her about thirty days in the thicke&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olitary re|ce&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t. He is then more ferocious than ever: When another male endeavours to occupy his place, he becomes perfectly furious; and they fight, wound, and often kill each other. <PB N="520" REF="536"> The wild &s;ow is never furious but when her pigs are attacked: And it may, in general, be remark|ed, that, in almo&s;t all wild animals, the males, during the rutting &s;ea&s;on, and the females, after they bring forth, become more or le&s;s furious.</P>
<P>The wild boar is hunted with dogs, or killed by &s;urpri&s;e during the night, when the moon &s;hines. As he flies &s;lowly, leaves a &s;trong odour behind him, and defends him&s;elf again&s;t the dogs, and often wounds them dangerou&s;ly, fine hunt|ing dogs are unnece&s;&s;ary, and would have their no&s;e &s;poiled, and acquire a habit of moving &s;low|ly by hunting him. Ma&s;tiffs, with very little training, are &s;ufficient. The olde&s;t, which are known by the track of their feet, &s;hould only be attacked: A young boar of three years old is difficult to hunt down; becau&s;e he runs very far without &s;topping. But the older boars do not run far, allow the dogs to run near, and of|ten &s;top to repel them. During the day, he commonly remains in his &s;oil, which is in the mo&s;t &s;eque&s;trated part of the woods. He comes out in the night in que&s;t of food. In &s;ummer, when the grain is ripe, it is ea&s;y to &s;urpri&s;e him among the cultivated fields, which he frequents every night. As &s;oon as he is &s;lain, the hunters cut off his te&s;ticles, the odour of which is &s;o &s;trong, that, in a few hours, it would infect the whole fle&s;h. The &s;nout of an old boar is the only part that is e&s;teemed; but every part of the ca&s;trated and young boar, not exceeding one <PB N="521" REF="537"> year fed, makes delicate eating. The pork of the dome&s;tic boar is &s;till wor&s;e than that of the wild boar; and it can only be rendered fit for eating by ca&s;tration and fattening. The an|tients<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. animal. lib. 6. cap 28.</NOTE> ca&s;trated the young boars which they could carry off from their mothers, and return|ed them to the woods, where they grew fat, and their pork was much better than that of dome|&s;tic
<HI>hogs.</HI></P>
<P>To tho&s;e who live in the country, the profits ari&s;ing from the hog are well known. Pork &s;ells nearly as dear as beef; the lard brings double or triple the price; the blood, the inte&s;tines, the feet, the tongue, are all prepared and u&s;ed as food. The dung of the hog is colder than that of other animals, and &s;hould not be u&s;ed but in grounds which are too warm and too dry. The fat of the inte&s;tines and web, which differs from common lard, is employed for grea&s;ing axles of wheels and many other purpo&s;es. Sieves are made of the &s;kin, and bru&s;hes, pencils, &amp;c. of the bri&s;tles. The fle&s;h of the hog takes &s;alt better, and keeps longer than that of any other animal.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies, though very numerous, and dif|fu&s;ed over Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, exi&s;ted not in the New Continent, till they were tran&s;ported thi|ther, and to mo&s;t of the American i&s;lands, by the Spaniards. In many places they have multiplied <PB N="522" REF="538"> greatly, and become wild. They re&s;emble our boards; and their bodies are &s;horter, and their &s;nout and &s;kin thicker than the dome&s;tic hogs, which, in warm climates, are all black, like the wild board.</P>
<P>By a ridiculous prejudice, which &s;uper&s;tition alone could &s;upport, the Mahometans are depri|ved of this u&s;eful animal. They have been told that it is unclean; and, therefore, they dare not either touch or feed it. The Chine&s;e, on the contrary, are extremely fond of pork. They rear hogs in numerous flocks, and pork is their mo&s;t common food. This circum&s;tance is &s;aid to have prevented them from embracing the religion of Mahomet. The Chine&s;e hogs, as well as tho&s;e of Siam and India, differ a little from the common kind. They are &s;maller, have &s;horter legs, and their fle&s;h is whiter and more delicate. They are reared in &s;everal places of France; and they intermix and produce with the dome&s;tic hog. Numbers of them are rear|ed by the Negroes; and, though there are few of them among the Moors, or in the countries inhabited by Mahometans; yet wild boars are as common in A&s;ia and Africa as in Europe.</P>
<P>Hence the&s;e animals affect not any particular climate: But the boar, by becoming dome&s;tic, &s;eems to have degenerated more in cold than in warm countries. A very &s;light alteration of climate is &s;ufficient to change their colour. In the northern provinces of France, and even in <PB N="523" REF="539"> Viverais, the hogs are generally white; but in Dauphiny, which is at no great di&s;tance, they are all black; and tho&s;e of Languedoc, Pro|vence, Spain, Italy, India, China, and America, are of the &s;ame colour. The hog of Siam has a greater re&s;emblance to the common hog than to the wild boar. The ears furni&s;h the mo&s;t evi|dent mark of degeneration; for they become more &s;upple, &s;oft, inclined, or pendulous, in proportion as the animal is altered, or rather as he has been &s;oftened by education in a dome&s;tic &s;tate: And, in fact, the ears of the dome&s;tic hog are more flexible, longer, and more inclined than tho&s;e of the wild boar, which ought to be regarded as the model of the &s;pecies.</P>

<P>I have little to add concerning the hogs of Europe, of Siam, and of China, which inter|mix together, and therefore con&s;titute but one &s;pecies. Tho&s;e of Europe are con&s;iderably lar|ger than the other races; and their &s;ize might be &s;till farther augmented, if they were allowed to live longer.
