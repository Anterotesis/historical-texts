<L>YOU told me, I remember, glory built</L>
<L>On &s;elfi&s;h principles, is &s;hame and guilt.</L>
<L>The deeds that men admire as half divine,</L>
<L>Stark naught, becau&s;e corrupt in their de&s;ign.</L>
<L>Strange doctrine this! that without &s;cruple tears</L>
<L>The laurel that the very light'ning &s;pares,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="5">
Brings down the warrior's trophy to the du&s;t,</L>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<L>I grant, that men continuing what they are,</L>
<L>Fierce, avaricious, proud, there mu&s;t be war.</L>
<L>And never meant the rule &s;hould be applied</L>
<L>To him that fights with ju&s;tice on his &s;ide.</L>
<L>Let laurels, drench'd in pure Parna&s;&s;ian dews,</L>
<L>Reward his mem'ry, dear to ev'ry mu&s;e,</L>
<L>Who, with a courage of un&s;haken root,</L>
<L>In honour's field advancing his firm foot,</L>
<L>Plants it upon the line that ju&s;tice draws,</L>
<L>And will prevail or peri&s;h in her cau&s;e.</L>
<L>Tis to the virtues of &s;uch men, man owes</L>
<L>His portion in the good that heav'n be&s;tows,</L>
<L>And when recording hi&s;tory di&s;plays</L>
<L>Feats of renown, though wrought in antient days,</L>
<L>Tells of a few &s;tout hearts that fought and dy'd</L>
<L>Where duty plac'd them, at their country's &s;ide,</L>
<L>The man that is not mov'd with what he reads,</L>
<L>That takes not fire at their heroic deeds,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="6">
Unworthy of the ble&s;&s;ings of the brave,</L>
<L>Is ba&s;e in kind, and born to be a &s;lave.</L>
<L>But let eternal infamy pur&s;ue</L>
<L>The wretch to naught but his ambition true,</L>
<L>Who, for the &s;ake of filling with one bla&s;t</L>

<L>The gla&s;s that bids man mark the fleeting hour,</L>

<L>Then grace the boney phantom in their &s;tead</L>

<HEAD>THE POET, THE OYSTER, AND SENSITIVE
PLANT.</HEAD>
<L>AN Oy&s;ter ca&s;t upon the &s;hore</L>
<L>Was heard, though never heard before;</L>
<L>Complaining in a &s;peech well worded,</L>
<L>And worthy thus to be recorded:</L>
<L>Ah haple&s;s wretch! condemned to dwell</L>
<L>For ever in my native &s;hell,</L>
<L>Ordain'd to move when others plea&s;e,</L>
<L>Not for my own content or ea&s;e,</L>
<L>But to&s;s'd and buffeted about,</L>
<L>Now <HI>in</HI> the water, and now <HI>out.</HI></L>
<L>'Twere better to be born a &s;tone</L>
<L>Of ruder &s;hape and feeling none,</L>
<L><PB N="363" REF="366">
Than with a tenderne&s;s like mine,</L>
<L>And &s;en&s;ibilities &s;o fine;</L>
<L>I envy that unfeeling &s;hrub,</L>
<L>Fa&s;t-rooted again&s;t ev'ry rub.</L>
<L>The plant he meant grew not far off,</L>
<L>And felt the &s;neer with &s;corn enough,</L>
<L>Was hurt, di&s;gu&s;ted, mortified,</L>
<L>And with a&s;perity replied.</L>
<L>When cry the botani&s;ts, and &s;tare,</L>
<L>Did plants call'd &s;en&s;itive grow there?</L>
<L>No matter when&mdash;a poet's mu&s;e is</L>
<L>To make them grow ju&s;t where &s;he chu&s;es.</L>
<L>You &s;hapele&s;s nothing in a di&s;h,</L>
<L>You that are but almo&s;t a fi&s;h,</L>
<L>I &s;corn your coar&s;e in&s;inuation,</L>
<L>And have mo&s;t plentiful occa&s;ion</L>
<L>To wi&s;h my&s;elf the rock I view,</L>
<L>Or &s;uch another dolt as you.</L>
<L>For many a grave and learned clerk,</L>
<L>And many a gay unletter'd &s;park,</L>
<L><PB N="364" REF="367">
With curious touch examines me,</L>
<L>If I can feel as well as he;</L>
<L>And when I bend, retire and &s;hrink,</L>
<L>Says, well&mdash;'tis more than one would think&mdash;</L>
<L>Thus life is &s;pent, oh fie upon't!</L>
<L>In being touch'd, and crying, don't.</L>
<L>A poet in his evening walk,</L>
<L>O'erheard and check'd this idle talk.</L>
<L>And your fine &s;en&s;e, he &s;aid, and yours,</L>
<L>Whatever evil it endures,</L>
<L>De&s;erves not, if &s;o &s;oon offended,</L>
<L>Much to be pitied or commended.</L>
<L>Di&s;putes though &s;hort, are far too long,</L>
<L>Where both alike are in the wrong;</L>
<L>Your feelings in their full amount,</L>
<L>Are all upon your own account.</L>
<L>You in your grotto-work inclos'd</L>
<L>Complain of being thus expos'd,</L>
<L>Yet nothing feel in that rough coat,</L>
<L>Save when the knife is at your throat,</L>
<L><PB N="365" REF="368">
Wherever driv'n by wind or tide,</L>
<L>Exempt from every ill be&s;ide.</L>
<L>And as for you, my Lady Squeami&s;h,</L>
<L>Who reckon ev'ry touch a blemi&s;h,</L>
<L>If all the plants that can be found</L>
<L>Embelli&s;hing the &s;cene around,</L>
<L>Should droop and wither where they grow,</L>
<L>You would not feel at all, not you.</L>
<L>The noble&s;t minds their virtue prove</L>
<L>By pity, &s;ympathy, and love,</L>
<L>The&s;e, the&s;e are feelings truly fine,</L>
<L>And prove their owner half divine.</L>
<L>His cen&s;ure reach'd them as he dealt it,</L>
<L>And each by &s;hrinking &s;hew'd he felt it.</L>
