<P>DURING my re&s;idence on
the Continent, I was &s;o
fortunate as to contract an ac|quaintance
with the pre&s;ent
<PB N="8" REF="5">
Bi&s;hop of M&mdash;o, who was for
many years &s;uperior of the
Scots College at Seville. To
that amiable man I am indebt|ed
for the following letters;
which were di&s;covered by him,
during his re&s;idence in Seville,
at the bottom of an old che&s;t,
which &s;tood in a de&s;erted
and traditionally haunted room
in the attic &s;tory of the Col|lege.</P>
<P>THE letters were tran&s;cribed
into a book that was bound in
vellum, and in good condition.
<PB N="9" REF="6">
From the date of the Preface
which is prefixed to them, they
appear to have been <HI>collected</HI> at
the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century.
At what time they were <HI>written,</HI>
it is impo&s; &s;ible now to deter|mine;
though probably about
the year 1671, as about that
time the dukedom of Arandina
became extinct by the death
of Don John twentieth and la&s;t
Duke.</P>
<P>THE author of the Preface
which is prefixed to the&s;e let|ters
&s;eems to have been well
<PB N="10" REF="7">
acquainted; with the hi&s;tory of
the hou&s;e of Arandina; and it
is by no means improbable,
that Father Alberto, who makes
&s;o important a figure through
the whole of the hi&s;tory, was
the per&s;on who thus pre&s;erved
it.</P>
<P>HAD the&s;e pages been the
production of a later period; I
&s;hould have been led to &s;up|po&s;e,
that the character of Al|berto
had been copied from
that of the Bi&s;hop of M&mdash;,
who&s;e many amiable qualities,
<PB N="11" REF="8">
and di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, have
in&s;ured to him the re&s;pect and
e&s;teem of all who are &s;o fortu|nate
as to rank in the number
of his acquaintance. Nor can
I lay down my pen without
expre&s;&s;ing the &s;atisfaction with
which I embrace this opportu|nity
of te&s;tifying my re&s;pect
for that truly amiable man;
who&s;e virtues would reflect ho|nour
on the highe&s;t &s;tation, and
who&s;e piety would adorn any
communion.</P>

How far the Editor has acted

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
PREFIXED TO THE
LETTERS,
BY THE
PERSON WHO COLLECTED THEM.</HEAD>
<P>DONNA I&s;abella della Villarea
was the only fruit of an un|fortunate
marriage. Her father was
the younger brother of Don John,
twentieth and la&s;t Duke of Arandina,
and grandee of the fir&s;t order. Don
Frederick, the father of I&s;abella, at
<PB N="14" REF="11">
an early period of his life, became
&s;trongly attached to Donna Eliza,
daughter of Don Carlos de Ulloa, a
grandee of the &s;econd cla&s;s.</P>
<P>THE narrowne&s;s of Don Frederick's
fortune retarded for a long time his
union with Donna Eliza. At length,
wearied with the frequent di&s;appoint|ments
he experienced, and not &s;ee|ing
any appearances in his favour,
he determined no longer to defer the
completion of his happine&s;s. He
had, indeed, repeatedly applied to
his brother for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the
only an&s;wer which he obtained from
the Duke was, that younger brothers
had better not marry. Don Frede|rick
now &s;tated his ca&s;e to Donna
<PB N="15" REF="12">
Eliza; who heroically preferred a
<HI>cottage</HI> with Don Frederick, to a
palace with the Duke of Ca&s;tillo
Neuovo, who at that time paid his
addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>DON FREDERICK was &s;oon ble&s;&s;ed
with the hand of Donna Eliza;
whil&s;t the family of Ulloa, incen&s;ed
to the la&s;t degree at the &s;tep &s;he had
taken, determined never more to &s;ee
her.</P>
<P>MEANTIME, Frederick and Eliza
retired to a &s;mall farm he had pur|cha&s;ed
in the province of Andalu&s;ia;
where, for &s;ome months, they ex|perienced
a &s;tate of uninterrupted
felicity; to which, however, a pe|riod
<PB N="16" REF="13">
was at length put by the villany
of the Duke of Ca&s;tillo Neuovo; for
one night, as Don Frederick was re|turning
home totally unattended,
the Duke, aided by a party of <HI>bravos,</HI>
attacked him. Don Frederick de|fended
him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t va|lour;
and, after di&s;patching the
Duke and two of the villains, &s;unk,
covered with wounds, and expired.
The remainder of the party in&s;tant|ly
retired with the body of the
Duke, whil&s;t that of Don Frederick,
was &s;oon after found by &s;ome pea|&s;ants
and carried home. The fir&s;t
per&s;on who encountered the mourn|ful
proce&s;&s;ion was Donna Eliza.
The &s;cene that en&s;ued is too horrible
for de&s;cription. Suffice it to &s;ay,
<PB N="17" REF="14">
that in a few hours I&s;abella was
born, and her mother recovered
by &s;low degrees from that phren&s;y
into which the death of Don Frede|rick
had driven her. Donna Eliza
continued in her retirement in An|dalu&s;ia,
where &s;he indulged her me|lancholy,
by &s;pending great part of
each day at the monument which
&s;he had reared over the du&s;t of her
beloved Lord. In this manner had
five years elap&s;ed, when Donna
Eliza found her&s;elf &s;eized with a
fever, which &s;he was a&s;&s;ured would
prove mortal. No &s;ooner did &s;he
receive the awful intelligence, than
&s;he addre&s;&s;ed the following letter
to the Duke of Arandina, to be
<PB N="18" REF="15">
delivered by I&s;abella after her
death.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DON JOHN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is in acts of mercy only that
man can re&s;emble Heaven. Re|member
<HI>that</HI> whil&s;t you read this
letter; which will not be delivered
to you till the trembling hand that
writes, and the bleeding heart that
dictates, are no more.</P>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE, that by marry|ing
your too-amiable brother I inju|red
him irreparably. I reduced
him to unmerited poverty; I depri|ved
him of your friend&s;hip and your
protection; and yet could only re|compence
all the&s;e lo&s;&s;es by be&s;tow|ing
<PB N="19" REF="16">
on him my unworthy &s;elf: A re|ward
highly inadequate to his de|&s;erts;
but the unfortunate Eliza had
no other to con&s;er, and the too-generous
Don Frederick was &s;atis|fied.</P>
<P>GREAT as is the plea&s;ure with
which I behold my approaching di&s;|&s;olution,
when I con&s;ider that a few
hours will certainly reunite me to
my much-beloved. Frederick; yet
my plea&s;ure is far from unalloyed,
when I reflect that the only fruit
of our fatal &s;hort-lived union, the
haple&s;s I&s;abella, who&s;e misfortunes
were coeval with her birth, will (if
you withhold your protection) be
expo&s;ed to innumerable dangers.
<PB N="20" REF="17">
Have pity, then, on the helple&s;s
orphan, who will deliver this to
your hands; and who, if you de&s;ert
her, will be left to the wide world,
without one friendly hand to guide
her infant &s;teps. Reflect, Don John,
on the ills to which the continuation
of your re&s;entment mu&s;t expo&s;e her.
Do not puni&s;h I&s;abella for the errors
of her unhappy parents. They have
drunk deep of the bitter cup of afflict|tion,
do not oblige her to &s;wallow
the dregs. By kindne&s;s to my I&s;a|bella,
you will atone for all the &s;uf|ferings
you have cau&s;ed me. I,
with my dying breath, forgive you;
and righteous Heaven will al&s;o par|don
you, if you are a protector to
my dear in&s;ant. A tremor, that now
<PB N="21" REF="18">
pervades my whole frame, obliges
me to conclude with once more a&s;|&s;uring
you of the pardon, nay, of the
e&s;teem, of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The unfortunate
ELIZA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>SCARCELY had Eliza fini&s;hed this
letter, when, cla&s;ping I&s;abella in her
arms, &s;he cea&s;ed to &s;igh, and &s;ought
her Frederick in the realms of bli&s;s.
No &s;ooner was Eliza entombed with
her Frederick, than I&s;abella was &s;ent
to the Ca&s;tle of Villarea, where Don
John then re&s;ided. On her arrival,
&s;he delivered to him her mother's
letter, which he read with con&s;ider|able
attention; and, after pau&s;ing
upon it for &s;ome time, he ordered his
<PB N="22" REF="19">
niece to be placed in the convent of
Ventina, where &s;he remained till the
age of &s;ixteen. The Duke then de|termined
to place her in his own
Ca&s;tle: a determination with which
&s;he was by no means plea&s;ed; as,
from the &s;pecimens which &s;he had
&s;een of her uncle's behaviour during
two or three &s;hort vi&s;its at the con|vent,
&s;he had no great pro&s;pect of
happine&s;s under his roof or in his
&s;ociety; Added to this, &s;he could
not bid an eternal adieu to tho&s;e
walls where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many
happy hours, without feeling &s;ome
pangs, e&s;pecially as &s;he was then to
be for ever &s;eparated from the friends
of her youth, of whom the mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hed
was Donna Laura de
<PB N="23" REF="20">
Ca&s;&s;ildina. The parting of the&s;e la|dies
was highly affecting to <HI>both,</HI>
but e&s;pecially to Donna I&s;abella,
who looked with horror on a world,
which &s;he had been ever taught to
con&s;ider as wor&s;e than it really is.</P>
<P>OF her reception at Villarea, a
full account is to be &s;een in her fir&s;t
letter to Donna Laura, with whom
&s;he con&s;tantly corre&s;ponded, and to
whom &s;he communicated every event
that befel her during their &s;epara|tion.</P>
<P>THUS, then, I have collected all
the facts relating to the life of Donna
I&s;abella della Villarea; a woman di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by every amiable quality;
<PB N="24" REF="21">
in whom even the prying eye
of envy could not di&s;cover a flaw,
whil&s;t malice Itself paid her virtue
the tribute of &s;ilence.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Ca&s;tle of Villarea.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the &s;acred injunc|tions
of my Laura, I &s;hall not
fail to inform her of every event, how|ever
trivial, that may occur in this
<PB N="26" REF="23">
dreary &s;olitude: A &s;olitude which
alone can be bani&s;hed by the pre|&s;ence
of her to whom I now write.
For her pre&s;ence, however, I have no
rea&s;on to hope; I am almo&s;t tempted
to &s;ay, I do not entertain a wi&s;h.
My uncle's behaviour could not fail
to render this place truly di&s;agree|able
to my deare&s;t friend; and great
as the happine&s;s of her &s;ociety mu&s;t
always be to the wretched I&s;abella,
it would &s;uffer an alloy which in the
end would prove its de&s;truction,
when I reflected that I was a &s;ource
of pain to her who has been the
friend of my youth, who &s;o kindly
&s;oothed my woes, and to whom I am
indebted for the &s;mall portion of &s;e|licity
which I once enjoyed&mdash;but
<PB N="27" REF="24">
of which I am now for ever
de|prived.</P>
<P>MY Laura will not be a little an|xious
to hear what was the reception
I met with from the Duke on my
arrival. He received me at the gate,
&s;urrounded by a numerous train of
dome&s;tics in rich dre&s;&s;es, who ap|peared
to me the fine&s;t people I had
ever &s;een; and though I have been
here &s;ome days, I cannot yet recon|cile
my&s;elf to giving them my or|ders.</P>
<P>MY uncle's reception of me was
formal and polite. He told the &s;er|vants,
that they mu&s;t henceforth con|&s;ider
me as their mi&s;tre&s;s, and mu&s;t.
<PB N="28" REF="25">
pay an implicit obedience to my com|mands.
He then introduced me to
his father-confe&s;&s;or, who re&s;ides in
the hou&s;e with him, and who ap|pears
to be about fifty, has a plea|&s;ing
countenance, an air &s;trongly
tinctured with melancholy, and man|ners
highly poli&s;hed. From what I
have &s;een of him, I have rea&s;on to
hope he will prove an agreeable com|panion,
A &s;ummons to attend the
Duke leaves me only time to &s;ub|&s;cribe
my&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the &s;ame to the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>TEN thou&s;and thanks for my
Laura's letter: it has &s;carce
ever been out of my hands &s;ince
its arrival. The affectionate re|gard
which you &s;o kindly expre&s;s
for me, &s;erves only to increa&s;e my
reget, when I reflect that I am for
<PB N="30" REF="27">
ever bani&s;hed from &s;o amiable a
friend. But, as you have often ob|&s;erved,
it is our duty to &s;ubmit, with|out
repining, to the di&s;pen&s;ations of
Providence, who&s;e conduct to &s;hort-&s;ighted
mortals &s;eems &s;ometimes &s;e|vere,
when it is directed to their
good, and when a different conduct
would involve them in misery. But
my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent is not to mo|ralize,
but to de&s;cribe the Ca&s;tle and,
its environs. The hou&s;e is ancient,
and the building has an air of me|lancholy
grandeur, well &s;uited to my
di&s;po&s;ition. The orange groves that
&s;urround it, and which are now in
full blo&s;&s;om, add greatly to the beau|ty
of the place; and, would Heaven
grant me the pre&s;ence of my Laura,
<PB N="31" REF="28">
I &s;hould e&s;teem it a perfect paradi&s;e.
A poor compliment this to Villarea;
as earth contains not the &s;pot, how|ever
barren or however horrid, that
would not appear to me a paradi&s;e,
if that &s;pot contained my Laura.</P>
<P>THE pea&s;antry are poor and lazy;
but as my uncle's, allowance to me is
liberal, I can remedy the former,
though not the latter evil. Indeed
I greatly fear all attempts on that
head will prove ineffectual; as every
writer, who has mentioned the pea|&s;antry
of Spain, &s;peaks of them as in|dolent
in the extreme. The mo&s;t in|du&s;trious
pea&s;antry of whom I have
ever read any account, are tho&s;e of
England; though, having only &s;een
<PB N="32" REF="29">
them repre&s;ented by writers of their
own country, I know not what cre|dit
is to be given to the repre&s;enta|tions.</P>
<P>IN your letter, you expre&s;s a wi&s;h
to become more acquainted with my
uncle. Of him, however, I know
nothing more than at my fir&s;t arri|val,
as he lives chie&s;ty alone; and,
wherever he appears, pre&s;erves &s;o
much &s;tate, as renders un&s;ucce&s;sful
all attempts to become acquainted
with him.</P>
<P>FATHER ALBERTO is a widely dif|ferent
character. His plea&s;ing man|ners
and melancholy air deeply in|tere&s;t
you in every thing that con|cerns
<PB N="33" REF="30">
him. He is &s;o good as to join
me in my walks, and exerts him&s;elf
on all occa&s;ions to render my resi|dence
here plea&s;ant. You would
like him much. If all men re&s;em|bled
him, what a world would this
be! My Laura perhaps would then
quit the peaceful cloi&s;ter, and adorn
&s;ome high &s;tation in active life.&mdash;
But I mu&s;t bid you adieu, as, the let|ters
are called for, and my paper is
nearly exhausted. I will, however,
always leave room enough to admit
of my &s;ub&s;cribbing myself,</P>

<P>MY Laura is too grateful for
my letters; as, were I de|barred
the privilege of addre&s;&s;ing her,
I &s;hould not know how to employ
tho&s;e hours of my life which I do
not con&s;ecrate to heaven. But &s;o
great is the plea&s;ure of writing to my

friend, that, whil&s;t I have my pen

am unfortunate. The Duke is going
to Madrid on bu&s;ine&s;s. How happy
is it for me that his exce&s;&s;ive <HI>hauteur</HI>

country, instead of &s;pending his
whole life in Madrid, as do all men
of his rank! But at Court he finds,
what he will never brook, <HI>&s;uperior.</HI>
He leaves me here to guard the Ca&s;tle
in his ab&s;ence. I am rejoiced that
I am not of the party, as then I &s;hould
have &s;carcely found time to tell my
Laura how I love her. But as I re|main
at Villarea, I &s;hall have little
el&s;e to do, except to offer up prayers

&mdash;The Duke is gone, attended by

am acquainted.</P>
<P>FORTY years ago, the ma&s;ter of
a Spani&s;h merchantman being on a
voyage to England, whither he was
bound to di&s;po&s;e of his cargo, it hap|pened
that one night there aro&s;e a
violent &s;torm. Ju&s;t as it began, he
de&s;cried an Engli&s;h &s;hip making &s;ig|nals
of di&s;tre&s;s; but the violence of
the hurricane prevented him from
rendering her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he
peri&s;hed in the &s;torm. The next
morning, the winds being now calm|ed,
he di&s;covered me, then not ap|parently
<PB N="44" REF="41">
above, a year old, floating
on a piece of the wreck. He in|&s;tantly
took me on board; and, &s;ome
&s;igns of life appearing, all attempts
were made for my recovery; and
the&s;e at la&s;t proving &s;ucce&s;sful, my
pre&s;erver, when all inquiries after
my original proved ineffectual, adop|ted
me as his &s;on. No fewer than
three Engli&s;h &s;hips had peri&s;hed in
that &s;torm; nor could he find any one
who knew that any of them had a
child on board. Thus was I pre|cluded
for ever from di&s;covering to
whom I owed my birth,&mdash;and whe|ther
or not both my parents peri&s;hed
in that fatal night;&mdash;fatal to <HI>me,</HI>
becau&s;e it deprived me of my natu|ral
protectors, and yet did not rob
<PB N="45" REF="42">
me of a life that has been perpetually
overca&s;t with the gloomy clouds of
misfortune. But the ways of Provi|dence
are un&s;earchable; and it is our
duty to &s;ubmit to its will without re|pining.
Nor have I any doubt but
that for wi&s;e and good rea&s;ons my
life was pre&s;erved from the mercile&s;s
waves. Under the roof of my &s;e|cond
father (who&s;e name I bear), the
fir&s;t &s;ixteen years of my life were
pa&s;&s;ed in ea&s;e and tranquillity, when
the good man propo&s;ed that I &s;hould
accompany him on a voyage to Italy.
As was natural at my age, I embra|ced
with plea&s;ure an offer of &s;eeing
foreign countries, and a few days
brought us in &s;ight of the Italian
coast. On our arrival at port, I ha|&s;tened
<PB N="46" REF="43">
on &s;hore, that I might gratify
my curio&s;ity, and make ob&s;ervations
on the inhabitants of a country which
had &s;o often given lords to the world.
It happened, that one night as I was
walking alone on a retired part of
the beach, I heard the &s;hrieks of &s;ome
per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, and they appeared
to be tho&s;e of a female. I followed
the &s;ound; and &s;oon di&s;covered two
ruffians dragging a mo&s;t beautiful
woman towards a boat that waited
for them. I flew with the utmo&s;t
&s;peed to re&s;cue the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair
one, and was happy enough to prove
&s;ucce&s;sful in the enterpri&s;e; for ha|ving
di&s;patched one of the villains,
the other made a precipitate retreat,
leaving me ma&s;ter of the field.</P></Q>

toward the hou&s;e, which terminated

the only daughter of a con&s;iderable
merchant of the name of Altino, and
heire&s;s to all his fortunes. <Q>To that

calamity from which your valour
has re&s;cued me. The <HI>fame of my

Among&s;t them was Alcanzar, for

whom I conceived an in&s;uperable
aver&s;ion, which his &s;ub&s;equent

"IN the &s;aloon I was introduced to

was with difficulty permitted to re|tire.
They a&s;&s;ured me how happy I

had taken leave of her father and

<PB N="59" REF="56">
a &s;hort voyage landed us at Cadiz.
But, ah! how altered was I &s;ince I
&s;ailed thence! I had &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s
we never can &s;uffer but once. The
change it had effected was &s;o &s;triking
as to be ob&s;erved by every one who
&s;aw me. I now played none but
plaintive airs, and &s;eldom touched
my guitar without bedewing it with
my tears. I was become the victim
of melancholy; and the image of
E&s;tafania was never ab&s;ent from my
mind. At night, when fancy was
permitted to rove unfettered by the
chains of rea&s;on, I was perpetually
wafted to tho&s;e &s;cenes of former joys,
the &s;hores of Italy, where indeed I
enjoyed a bli&s;s &s;upreme, the &s;ociety of
my E&s;tafania. But, alas! the bli&s;sful
<PB N="60" REF="57">
phantoms vani&s;hed at the approach
of day, and each new &s;un beheld my
griefs increa&s;e. In this manner near
a year had elap&s;ed, when my kind

that he was &s;oon to revi&s;it Italy. You
will ea&s;ily conceive with what readi|ne&s;s
I embraced the propo&s;al, and
with what anxiety I embarked; but
when the &s;hores of Italy appeared,
my anxiety became unutterable.
Sometimes my fancy repre&s;ented
E&s;tafania welcoming me with joy;
&s;ometimes her <HI>monument</HI> ro&s;e to my

I &s;aw her ble&s;&s;ing the arms

beneath the &s;hade of a large willow,

Heaven beholds the conduct

continue with un&s;haken per&s;e|verance

virtue, finds an a&s;ylum in her brea&s;t,

<P>OH, my Laura! how can I paint
my pre&s;ent feelings? The
Duke being &s;uddenly called from
home for a few days, I determined
to gratify an inclination I had long
felt, and to indulge my feelings by
<PB N="75" REF="72">
vi&s;iting the hallowed &s;pot where the
honoured a&s;hes of my parents moul|der.
Accompanied by Alberto, I
&s;et out for the village where my in|fant
years were &s;pent. At the clo&s;e
of day we reached the hamlet; and
having &s;ecured a lodging at the hou&s;e
of the Cur&egrave;, I repaired, with a throb|bing
heart, to the tomb of my pa|rents.
A grove of cypre&s;s appeared.
I entered with cautious &s;teps, as if I
feared to waken tho&s;e who &s;lept. It
is a covered monument in the form
of an altar, compo&s;ed of black and
white marble. I would have advan|ced,
but the &s;cene was too much for
my weak spirits. I fainted in the
arms of Alberto and Marianne.
When their attention re&s;tored me, I
<PB N="76" REF="73">
approached the tomb; and, by the
pale moon's uncertain light, read
the in&s;cription, which mentioned
their names, and the dates of their
re&s;pective deaths. O Heaven, Laura,
what were my feelings! I fell on my
knees,&mdash;I bedewed the hallowed
marble with my tears,&mdash;called on
each, dear departed &s;hade;&mdash;then
turned to heaven my &s;treaming eyes,
and begged a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>IN vain Alberto tried to remove
me from the monument: for me it
bad re&s;i&s;tle&s;s attractions; and whil&s;t
memory is mine, &s;hall be for ever
dear. At length I was per&s;uaded to
retire; but it was with the greate&s;t
difficulty I could ever prevail on my|&s;elf
<PB N="77" REF="74">
to quit the awful &s;cene. The
&s;tream, that flowed with melancholy
murmurs through the grove, &s;eemed
to reproach me for quitting the &s;a|cred
&s;pot; but half the night was
&s;pent, and Alberto feared a longer
&s;tay might injure my health. I com|plied
with his wi&s;h. On my arrival
at the Cur&egrave;'s, I in&s;tantly retired to
my apartment; and, notwith&s;tand|ing
the dejection of my &s;pirits, I fell
a&s;leep. Fancy, fleeting fancy, tran&s;|ported
me back to the tomb of Fre|deric
and Eliza. It appeared to me,
after I had remained &s;ome time kneel|ing
at their &s;hrine, that the monu|ment
opened, and that I in&s;tantly
entered; the ma&s;&s;ive portals then
clo&s;ed, and I waked to lament an
<PB N="78" REF="75">
exi&s;tence that is indeed painful. At
the fir&s;t dawn of the day I revi&s;ited
the grove; and, after &s;hedding &s;ome

<P>OH, Laura, what a &s;cene have

to walk that we might enjoy the de|lightful
evening. Scarcely had we
entered the grove that terminates
<PB N="84" REF="81">

the clashing of &s;words; and in a
moment my terror was increa&s;ed to
the highe&s;t, at &s;eeing a man with a

blood, &s;pring over the &s;ence. No
&s;ooner did I behold this horrid &s;pec|tacle,

the stranger who had thus alarmed
us reque&s;ted our protection, inform|ing
us that he had ju&s;t e&s;caped from
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, with whom he had long
maintained an unequal combat. Fa|ther
Alberto having a&s;&s;ured him of

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it to

We had an interview with
the unfortunate &s;tranger, who is now
&s;o much recovered from his wounds
as to &s;it in the garden on a bench for
&s;ome hours every day. At our ap|proach,
<PB N="88" REF="85">
he attempted to ri&s;e; but
from lo&s;s of blood was too feeble.
After recovering him&s;elf a little, and
returning his thanks in the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing

 <Q>I am the only &s;on of Albino de
Ca&s;tina a merchant in Cadiz, who
has a &s;mall hou&s;e in this neighbour|hood,
whither I was going when
attacked by the ruffians, from
whom you &s;o kindly protected me.
They were hired to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me
by a woman of con&s;iderable wealth,
who has done me the honour to
entertain &s;entiments in my favour.
To the&s;e I made not a &s;uitable re|turn;
which has &s;o exa&s;perated her,
that &s;he determined on having a
bloody revenge. On that revenge
<PB N="89" REF="86">
I &s;hall ever reflect with plea&s;ure,
since to it. I am indebted for the
honour of being known to the pre|&s;ent
company. My humble &s;itua|tion
in life precludes me from te&s;ti|fying
my gratitude in any way
but by words; yet you will, I

<P>HE was by this time &s;o much ex|hau&s;ted,
that Father Alberto inter|rupted

<P>AT the reque&s;t of your I&s;abella,
I have taken up my pen, to
communicate to you every circum&s;tance
relating to her pre&s;ent misfor|tune.
La&s;t night the Duke return|ed,
and retired to his apartment
<PB N="147" REF="144">
without any thing remarkable in his
conduct. But this morning he or|dered
all the &s;ervants to attend him
in the great hall; when, producing
a letter from a woman of the name
of Gonzara (the woman who endea|vored
to procure the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of
Alonzo), he obliged the gardener to
read it aloud. It contained a full
account of Alonzo's rencounter with
I&s;abella in the grove, as well as of
the parting &s;cene which took place
in my ab&s;ence. This account, &s;he
&s;aid, was communicated to her by
the gardener; who now threw him&s;elf
on his knees, and implored the
Duke's pardon for having concealed
the affair from his knowledge. No
&s;ooner was the Duke convinced that
<PB N="148" REF="145">
his information was well founded,
than his appearance cea&s;ed to be hu|man.
The man was in&s;tantly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
for having concealed from the
Duke what, for a few dollars, he had
communicated to Gonzara. Poor
I&s;abella, during this &s;cene, had
&s;wooned. Happily every attempt to
recover, her proved ineffectual; &s;o
that &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible of the abu&s;e
with which &s;he was loaded by the
Duke. I intreated the Duke to be
le&s;s violent; a&s;&s;uring him that I had
been the advi&s;er of I&s;abella through
the whole of the affair, at lea&s;t as
far as related to receiving Alonzo
when wounded, and to procuring
a proper attendance to be paid to
him during his illne&s;s. Adding, at
<PB N="149" REF="146">
the &s;ame time, that illu&s;trious as was
the hou&s;e of Arandina, it mu&s;t ever
receive additional lu&s;tre from acts of
mercy and benevolence; and that no
&s;tation, however exalted, could ex|empt
us from the duties which we
owe to our fellow-pilgrims in the
vale of tears. To this the Duke re|plied,
that I was the fir&s;t per&s;on who
had ever propo&s;ed to convert his
gardener's lodge into an infirmary
for all rogues who happened to quar|rel
on his e&s;tate; and that both his
niece and I were very much to blame
for the part we had acted. I &s;aid,
Whatever might be the errors of I&s;a|bella,
I was &s;ure they would, on
inquiry, prove to be tho&s;e of the
head, and not of the heart; and that
<PB N="150" REF="147">
the former were very excu&s;able in

<P>AT her reque&s;t, I communicated

of I&s;abella in the mo&s;t favourable

that &s;he di&s;couraged all hopes in the
brea&s;t of Alonzo. He &s;till continued
to rave at I&s;abella, till on the arrival
of Alonzo his fury took another
cour&s;e. No &s;ooner did this unfor|tunate
youth appear, than he loaded
him with every po&s;&s;ible in&s;ult, and
at la&s;t &s;truck him. On this, Alonzo
drew his &s;word, but happily was di&s;|armed
by the attendants. The Duke
now ordered his hands to be tied;
and producing his patent of creation,
read it aloud to Alonzo. In it were

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received your letter,
which to me was totally unin|telligible.
I was ignorant of your
ever having &s;een the Duke. The
<PB N="188" REF="165">
kind Alberto, unwilling to increa&s;e
my pain, had concealed from me
that fatal interview to which your
letter alludes. I do not wonder
that you were exa&s;perated: &s;uch
treatment no one could bear. It was
unmerited; it was unju&s;t in the la&s;t
extreme. But yet, my Alonzo,
when vengeance lifts her &s;word and
points it at the brea&s;t of Don John,
let the tears of I&s;abella avert the
blow.&mdash;Oh! Alonzo, you can give
me no proof of that affection you
pro&s;e&s;s for me&mdash;&s;o real, &s;o plea&s;ing,
&s;o generous,&mdash;as by pardoning Don
John. O ever bear in mind that he
is the &s;ole earthly protector of that
I&s;abella whom you profe&s;s to adore.
<PB N="197" REF="166">
I am poor&mdash;Never till now did I
wi&s;h for wealth&mdash;yet if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it,
I would not injure thy generous &s;oul
by the offer. No! the only bribe I
will ever propo&s;e as the reward of
your forbearance&mdash;is my friend&s;hip;
&mdash;<HI>that</HI> is the &s;ole offering I can make
at the &s;hrine of your injured honour.

<P>ALL my apprehen&s;ions for the
&s;afety of the Duke being re|moved
by the promi&s;e Alonzo has
given me not to take vengeance on
<PB N="201" REF="170">
him for his conduct at the Ca&s;tle, I
&s;hall now expre&s;s to my Laura the
fears I entertain concerning my fu|ture
happine&s;s. Oh, my Laura, how
little do we &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals
know what will be conducive to our
happine&s;s! The time was when I
thought that no event (however
gloomy in its appearance) could be
deemed unfortunate, if it was the
occa&s;ion of my returning to Ventina
and to you. But, ah! how chan|ged
are all my &s;entiments! How
often have I wearied Heaven with
prayers that I might return to Ven|tina!
<HI>now</HI> the mention of tho&s;e walls
fills my mind with horror. Why
this wonderful change? Is Laura
<PB N="202" REF="171">
le&s;s beloved than before? No, <HI>that</HI>
is impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Is I&s;abella le&s;s ena|moured
of virtue than &s;he once was?
She hopes not.&mdash;Is her heart a &s;tran|ger
to love? Ah, no! <HI>that</HI> is the &s;ad
truth&mdash;Alonzo is beloved. Within
Ventina's walls he never mu&s;t ap|pear;
yet Villarea is not more <HI>propi|tious</HI>
to his wi&s;hes than Ventina. But
the &s;olemn vow I &s;o &s;oon mu&s;t make,
chills my blood with horror. Have
mercy on me, Heaven. Oh! How
my heart throbs! Adieu, dear Laura.
