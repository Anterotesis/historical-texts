<P>EACH day that dawns on me is

This morning the Duke &s;ent for me,

<P>POOR I&s;abella's &s;ufferings in|crea&s;e
daily. You know that
&s;he has refu&s;ed the Count of Altina,
and that &s;he is now condemned,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
without hopes of a reprieve, to pa&s;s
her days in the convent of Ven|tina.
Her conduct has been highly
proper in refu&s;ing to marry Altina,
when her hand only was at her di&s;|po&s;al.
I endeavour to comfort her
as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to &s;upport
her in all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es. That &s;he
may receive from Heaven that &s;up|port
which &s;he &s;o much needs, &s;hall
be the con&s;tant prayer of her af|flicted
friend.</P>
<P>SHE is to be with you in about three
weeks. I think with plea&s;ure that
amid&s;t all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, Heaven has
&s;pared &s;o amiable and &s;o real a friend
as &s;he has ever found in you. I
<PB N="19" REF="18">
wondered much that the Duke &s;o
readily gave up all thoughts of mar|rying
her to Altina. But it &s;eems
he did not think it con&s;i&s;tent with

<HI>that,</HI> he &s;aid, would have appeared
as if the match was an object of im|portance
to his family;&mdash;now, &s;aid
he, there is no family, by a con|nection
with which the hou&s;e of
Arandina would receive additional
lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THUS, for once, has poor I&s;a|bella
been benefited by that pride
which has been the &s;ource of her
<HI>own</HI> and her <HI>parents</HI> wo! Heaven
&s;upport her, poor girl. I mu&s;t go

your la&s;t letter? You are indeed ig|norant
when you are to revi&s;it Vil|larea.
Had you entertained for Alonzo
that regard you pro&s;e&s;s towards him,
you would have imitated the con|duct

would have ble&s;&s;ed Alonzo with
your hand. He would have a&s;ked

He does adore her; he ever <HI>mu&s;t</HI>

cruel? why regret that &s;he is bound

<P>I WAS, as you ob&s;erved, greatly af|fected
by your departure, and do
not wonder that you were as much &s;o;
<PB N="55" REF="54">
but I tru&s;t, that, the bitter &s;cene
once pa&s;t, you will become every

will be moderated by time. You
are, undoubtedly, a great object of
pity; I never knew a greater: but
&s;till, amid&s;t all your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, you
will find great con&s;olation by reflect|ing
on your retiring from the world
&s;o early; for, believe me, we are
better calculated to &s;truggle with,
misfortune in youth than in age.
At the fir&s;t dawn of life the world is
tolerable, becau&s;e it is novel: but in
the evening of our day (for the life
of man, when compared with eter|nity,
is no more), when life has lo&s;t

to the being who, oppre&s;&s;ed with
misfortune, relies on it alone for
comfort and for happine&s;s.</P>
<P>YOUR uncle &s;ets out for Madrid
to-morrow, having received a &s;udden
and unexpected call to court. He
propo&s;es writing to you on his re|turn.
I am to accompany him to the
capital, where, he &s;ays, our &s;tay is
to be &s;hort. I am &s;orry to hear, that
the Count of Altina is much di&s;|plea&s;ed
with your uncle's conduct;
not &s;o much by his refu&s;al, as by
the manner of it: he has, I hear,
vowed to be revenged; but I tru&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="56">
he will not put his threats in exe|cution.</P>
<P>I INTREATED your uncle to &s;end
a le&s;s haughty refu&s;al: but all I &s;aid
was in vain; he was determined to
&s;upport the dignity of the hou&s;e of

his <HI>inferiors,</HI> but to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who are

<P>I HAVE written to Alonzo, in|forming
him of my return, and the

much di&s;atisfied with my conduct,
and even accu&s;es me of treachery;

will not feel the effects of Altina's

them, as I did tho&s;e of the injured

pride! The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion is
proved by every page of my &s;ad

all my parents' wo, and of my own.

<P>SCARCE had I fini&s;hed the per|u&s;al
of your la&s;t, &mdash; where you
ob&s;erve how fatal to happine&s;s are
<PB N="63" REF="62">
the effects of pride, &mdash; when the Duke
was brought home in the arms of
two &s;ervants, covered with wounds
and blood. He was followed by
Alonzo, who was al&s;o wounded; but
not &s;o &s;everely. When the Duke
was placed on a couch, and the &s;ur|geons
had dre&s;&s;ed his wounds, Alon|zo
addre&s;&s;ed him in the following
words: "Learn, Don John, from
this night's adventure, that a man
may act with <HI>honour,</HI> though his <HI>an|ce&s;tors</HI>
were not <HI>ennobled.</HI>" On &s;ay|ing
the&s;e words, he retired to his
own hou&s;e, attended by the &s;ur|geons;
who have; declared that <HI>he</HI> is
not in any danger. About the <HI>Duke</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="63">
they art &s;till doubtful; but I hope
the be&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM Alonzo, whom I this day
vi&s;ited, I learned the following ac|count
of the adventure. As the
Duke was returning home in his
coach, he pa&s;&s;ed through a retired
&s;treet, where the carriage was at|tacked,
by three Villains armed with
daggers. They ordered the coach|man
to &s;top in&s;tantly. The Duke,
on hearing their voices, and &s;eeing
them attempt to force open the door
of the carriage, opened the door on
the opo&s;ite &s;ide, and jumped out. He
then &s;et his back again&s;t a wall; and,
throwing his cloke over his left arm,
<PB N="65" REF="64">
&s;tood on his defence. He was in|&s;tantly
attacked by the ruffians, who
wounded him de&s;perately; his lac|keys
having in the mean time run
off, leaving their ma&s;ter to be a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated.
Whil&s;t the Duke was en|gaged
in this unequal conte&s;t, Alon|zo
happened to pa&s;s that way. He
ea&s;ily recognized the per&s;on who
was calling loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and
without delay &s;tabbed two of the
villains, who in&s;tantly fell; whil&s;t
the other is &s;ecured and has con|fe&s;&s;ed
that he was hired by the Count
of Altina to murder the Duke.&mdash;You,
I&s;abella, refu&s;ed to be&s;tow
your, hand on one man when your
heart was the property of another
<PB N="66" REF="65">
Heaven has, you &s;ee, rewarded you;
by delivering you from being united
to a man who is in fact an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.
A character; alas! too common in
Spain: The Duke's mi&s;fortune has
not produced the lea&s;t change in his
&s;entiments. I flattered my&s;elf, that
the per&s;on to whom he owed his
life might have been rewarded with
the hand of I&s;abella: but, on my
&s;ugge&s;ting the matter to him, he was
much enraged; and &s;aid, "that he
would rather have experienced a &s;till
more hateful death, than have his
life prolonged only to behold the
di&s;grace of his family! &mdash; A family
that will &s;oon be extinct; and of
which it may then be &s;aid, that, du|ring
<PB N="67" REF="66">
a cour&s;e of nine hundred years,
it has retained its nobility unconta|minated.
As to the young man
(continued he) who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me
in di&s;patching tho&s;e villains, I &s;hall
reward him in a manner becoming
his &s;tation, by be&s;towing on him a
large &s;um of money; &mdash; a reward
much fitter for a, merchant than an
illu&s;trious wife!"&mdash;How Alonzo
will bear this fre&s;h in&s;ult I know
not; but as he is &s;trongly attached
to you, I tru&s;t you will be able to
pacify his ju&s;t re&s;entment.</P>

mournful letter, than I &s;hall in wri|ting

it; for it is with un&s;eigned grief
that I communicate to you the dread|ful
intelligence.</P>
<P>THREE nights ago, this convent
was near being reduced to a&s;hes by
the heedle&s;&s;ness of a &s;ervant, who
neglected to extingui&s;h the fire of
the kitchen before &s;he went to re&s;t.
About eleven at night, I was alarm|ed
by the cry of fire; and as &s;oon as I
had left my apartment, I found that,
owing to the violence of the wind
which then blew high, the flames
had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s.
I ordered the doors to be in&s;tantly
thrown open; and advi&s;ed every one
<PB N="95" REF="94">
to &s;ecure her&s;elf by flight: an ad|vice
which was followed by all but the
amiable girl, who was &s;o lately
added to our &s;ociety. After we had
retired to a neighbouring church,
I inquired if all the &s;i&s;terhood were
there in &s;afety; and was &s;hocked to
find that &s;he was &s;till mi&s;&s;ing. I in|&s;tantly
returned to the convent,
where I found the flames &s;till raging
with the utmo&s;t violence, notwith|&s;tanding
every attempt to extingui&s;h
them; but in vain I endeavoured to
learn any thing concerning the love|ly
I&s;ebella. You will ea&s;ily conceive
what mu&s;t have been my feelings.
The next morning, however, I re|ceived
<PB N="96" REF="95">
the melancholy information
that &s;he was &s;een, after we had quit|ted
the convent, lying at the foot of
the altar: but the confu&s;ion was &s;o
great, that no one was &s;ufficiently
recollected to render her the lea&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and as that part of the
chapel was totally de&s;troyed, there is,
alas! no room to doubt that &s;he pe|ri&s;hed
in the flames. All attempts
to di&s;cover even the lea&s;t remains of
the dear girl have proved totally in|effectual.
You will do me the ju|&s;tice
to believe, that among&s;t all the
fatal con&s;equences of this &s;ad cata&s;|trophe,
the lo&s;s of that dear girl mo&s;t
deeply affects her, who is, with &s;in|cere

you will ea&s;ily believe how &s;incerely
I &s;ympathi&s;e with you on your lo&s;s.
The &s;ad cata&s;trophe, as you ob&s;er|ved,
affects only tho&s;e friends who
are, perhaps for years, to lament the
fate of the dear I&s;abella. You have
indeed &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s, in &s;ome re|&s;pects,

deprived of her &s;weet &s;ociety. Yet
I &s;hould have had the plea&s;ure of

<P>THE happie&s;t of beings has now
the plea&s;ure to addre&s;s you;
and to inform you, that I&s;abella,
<PB N="111" REF="110">
whom you doubtle&s;s con&s;ider as no
more, is in perfect health in New
Spain. To explain this my&s;tery,
you mu&s;t know, that after I had em|barked
for that country, whence I
never thought to return, I found it
would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ail till one
in the morning. On receiving this
intelligence, I got into a boat, and
went on &s;hore to contemplate, for
the la&s;t time, tho&s;e hated walls that
deprived me of I&s;abella. As the
convent is, you know, almo&s;t clo&s;e
to the &s;hore, I &s;oon found my&s;elf
there; and de&s;iring the men to wait
a little, I quitted them to indulge
my&s;elf in walking round the walls of
the garden. But as I was going to
<PB N="112" REF="111">
return to the boat, ob&s;erving the
convent in flames, and the doors
thrown wide open, I in&s;tantly flew
to the gate, and pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved
through the crowd of nuns who
were ru&s;hing out, and who were
too much engaged by attention to
their own pre&s;ervation even to ob|&s;erve
me. As I knew that my I&s;a|bella
had not yet a&s;&s;umed the con|ventual
dre&s;s, I was &s;ure &s;he had
not e&s;caped me in the crowd. I
flew therefore to that part of the
convent where &s;he re&s;ided; and as
I pa&s;&s;ed through the chapel, I ob|&s;erved
a female pro&s;trate at the foot
of the altar; who, on a nearer ap|proach,
proved to be that dear angel,
<PB N="113" REF="112">
who had fallen down in a &s;woon, and
lay there without any &s;igns of life.
I, however, lo&s;t no time; but,
catching the lovely burden in my
arms, bore her, &s;till &s;en&s;ele&s;s, to
the boat that waited for me; which,
as the nuns had all fled the other
way, I reached totally unob&s;erved.
No &s;ooner had I placed her in the
boat, than I tried every po&s;&s;ible
means to re&s;tore her; but to no pur|po&s;e.
My agonies were now incon|ceivable,
but I &s;till continued my
endeavours; and after rowing about
thirteen minutes, we reached the
ve&s;&s;el, which was ju&s;t going to hoi&s;t
&s;ail. The Captain, who had ob|&s;erved
the fire, ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed whence
<PB N="114" REF="113">
I had &s;tolen &s;o invaluable a trea&s;ure,
and objected to receiving her for fear
of con&s;equences; till ob&s;erving that
&s;he had not the dre&s;s of a nun, at
my earne&s;t entreaties he con&s;ented
to receive the dear girl; who now,
to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, began to
di&s;cover &s;igns of life. As &s;oon as
we were on board, the ve&s;&s;el got
under way, whil&s;t I conveyed I&s;a|bella
into the great cabin; where
&s;he was &s;oon re&s;tored, owing to the
kindne&s;s of a lady, who, with her
hu&s;band, was going to New Spain.
As &s;oon as &s;he recovered and learned
her &s;ituation, &s;he in&s;tantly relap&s;ed,
and it was with difficulty that &s;he was
the &s;econd time re&s;tored at all. When
<PB N="115" REF="114">
&s;he came to her&s;elf, I informed her
of the &s;ituation in which I had found
her; and that, had I not arrived at
the in&s;tant I did, &s;he mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed
in the flames, as every one
had fled and left her to meet her
fate. She in <HI>time</HI> became more re|conciled
to her &s;ituation; but at <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
&s;he earne&s;tly intreated to be put on
&s;hore. This, however, the Captain
a&s;&s;ured her, was impo&s;&s;ible; as the
&s;hip run nine notes in the hour, and
our di&s;tance was then near twenty
miles from the &s;hores of Spain. She
expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude to me for
pre&s;erving her life, but regretted
that I had taken advantage of the
general confu&s;ion to elope with her.
<PB N="116" REF="115">
I pleaded only in my defence, that
I was human, and that no man could
have neglected to embrace &s;o heaven|born
an opportunity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all
he held dear on earth. But, an|&s;wered
&s;he, my uncle will always
&s;u&s;pect that mine was a <HI>voluntary</HI>
e&s;cape, and will never pardon me.
Nay, perhaps good Alberto may
even &s;u&s;pect me (and here &s;he wept
bitterly.) If Laura &s;till live (Hea|ven
grant &s;he do), every &s;he may &s;u|&s;pect
I&s;abella. &mdash; I a&s;&s;ured her, that
tho&s;e who knew I&s;abella would never
&s;uppo&s;e her capable of acting but
as an angel would do, were it in her
&s;ituation. As to Laura, I could only
&s;ay, that I <HI>thought</HI> &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me in
<PB N="117" REF="116">
the crowd which ru&s;hed out as I
entered; and that as I &s;aw no one in
the convent, I hoped and believed
&s;he was &s;afe. In about a week, I
pre&s;umed to &s;olicit the ble&s;&s;ing of
her hand, exerted all the per&s;ua&s;ion
I was ma&s;ter of, and with great
difficulty prevailed on her to confer
on me a reward that would have
overpaid whole ages of mi&s;ery. As
there was a prie&s;t on board, who was
al&s;o a pa&s;&s;enger, we were married,

to &s;ee me, though I was totally; un|known

might congratulate me on the joy|ful
news. I now indeed am happy.

<P>I WAS this day alarmed with a
great noi&s;e i&s;&s;uing from the
Duke's apartment. I in&s;tantly went
<PB N="165" REF="136">
to learn the rea&s;on of the tumult;
and the moment I entered the room,
perceived the Duke weltering in his
blood. The phy&s;ician who attended
him told me, that he had left the
Duke only an in&s;tant, whil&s;t he went
to the next apartment to bring him
&s;ome medicine; and when he return|ed,
he found him in this horrid con|dition,
with a dagger in his hand;
which it &s;eems he had procured, but
<HI>how</HI> I have not been able to di&s;co|ver.
When I arrived, there were
&s;carce any &s;igns of life; and in a few
moments the Duke breathed his
la&s;t. Poor wretched man! he is a
&s;ad instance of the fatal effects of
pride.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="137">
I HAVE ordered &s;everal hundred
ma&s;&s;es to be offered up for his &s;oul,
that, through the infinite mercy of
the Almighty, &s;he may at la&s;t gain
admi&s;&s;ion into the bright regions of
eternal day; where the vain di&s;tinc|tions
of birth are unknown, and
where humility is preferred to ela|tion
of heart. May his example
warn others to &s;hun tho&s;e errors that
embittered his <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> and clouded
his <HI>pro&s;pects</HI> of a <HI>future,</HI> life!</P>
<P>BY his death I&s;abella &s;ucceeds
to his enormous property; which,
had &s;he not e&s;caped that fatal
night, would have devolved to the
<PB N="167" REF="138">
Crown. I have &s;ent immediate
intelligence to the Marchione&s;s of
Villarea (for the dukedom being
extinct, that title devolves to the
amiable I&s;abella); and have, in
her name, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Duke's funeral is fixed for
to-morrow, and as his rank was
&s;o high, I have ordered it to be con|ducted
in a pompous manner; tho',
alas! I fear his &s;pirit will receive
little plea&s;ure from the pomp with
which his remains will be con&s;igned
to the grave, where all di&s;tinction

<P>YESTERDAY a ve&s;&s;el from
New Spain arrived here; on
board of which there was a lady of
<PB N="170" REF="141">
di&s;tinction, who&s;e hu&s;band had been
drowned in the cour&s;e of the voyage;
and I was informed that &s;he was in a
very bad &s;tate. On receiving this in|telligence,
I, as was my duty, went
on board the &s;hip, and found that
the lady was of Villarea; and that
her only &s;on, an infant of nine
months old, was with her. She was
&s;o weak as not to be able to &s;peak,
and it was apprehended &s;he could
not &s;urvive many days. I had her
landed and placed in one of the be&s;t
hou&s;es here where &s;he is attended
by the faculty of the place; and
they give me hopes that &s;he may
yet recover. I learnt from one of
her attendants, that you are her
<PB N="171" REF="142">

my informing you of her &s;|ituation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA.</HEAD>
<P>I TOLD you in my la&s;t hurried
&s;crawl, that our I&s;abella was ar|rived
in Spain, and what misfortunes
<PB N="173" REF="144">
had befallen her. The in&s;tant I had
&s;cratched the&s;e few lines to you, I
&s;et off for Cadiz, and found the &s;ad
mourner in a very mi&s;erable &s;tate,
as you will &s;uppo&s;e. She had, how|ever,
recovered her &s;trength &s;o much
as to be able to &s;peak; and &s;howed
great plea&s;ure at my arrival. She
was in bed, and appeared wan and
much exhau&s;ted. On a little couch,
near the bed, lay a &s;miling in&s;ant
that &s;eems to inherit all its mo|ther's
charms. She wept bitterly
on my ki&s;&s;ing the &s;weet babe;
and &s;aid, it was all &s;he had by
which to remember her Alonzo.
It was about nine months old;
<PB N="174" REF="145">
and &s;he has named it Frederick
Alonzo.</P>
<P>I HOPE God will &s;upport her
in all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, of which Hea|ven
has given her a large propor|tion.
Indeed I have never cea&s;ed
to weep &s;ince I arrived here. To
&s;ee the mother hang in agony over
her infant &s;on, to hear her &s;ighs,
and to witne&s;s. her &s;orrows, is too
much for me.</P>
<P>OF poor, amiable, Alonzo's death,
I received the following account
from one of her attendants. After
they had embarked for Old Spain,
<PB N="175" REF="146">
and were ju&s;t out of the harbour,
I&s;abella recollected a ca&s;ket, con|taining
the certificate of her mar|riage,
which &s;he had left on &s;hore.
Alonzo in&s;i&s;ted on going to fetch it
him&s;elf, and got into a boat; they
were about this time two miles from
&s;hore. Scarce had the boat got half
way, when a hurricane over&s;et her;
all her crew peri&s;hed, and the &s;hip
was driven out to &s;ea. The hurri|cane
continued for twelve hours; du|ring
which time the &s;hip was in the
greate&s;t danger of foundering. When
the hurricane &s;ub&s;ided, they found
them&s;elves far out at &s;ea; and the
wind was &s;o contrary, that they
<PB N="176" REF="147">
could not return to inquire if the
corp&s;e of Alonzo had been driven on
&s;hore; for there were no hopes of his
life being pre&s;erved, as the hurricane
was &s;o violent that no one could
gain the &s;hore. Poor I&s;abella was
for a long time quite delirious, and
accu&s;ed her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of his
death. I tru&s;t, however, that &s;he
will yet recover, and that the young
Alonzo will not be deprived of both
his parents.</P>
<P>SHE &s;ays, whenever &s;he is able
to hold a pen, &s;he will write to
you. She &s;ends her love to you:
and I mu&s;t now lay down my
<PB N="177" REF="148">
pen, as the phy&s;icians are arrived;
and I always attend her when they
come.</P>

<P>O LAURA, what ec&s;tacy will
you feel at the peru&s;al of this
letter! Ye&s;terday, as the Marchione&s;s
<PB N="182" REF="153">
and I were walking in the grove, a
figure approached us, which &s;o near|ly
re&s;embled Alonzo that I &s;tarted;
but on a nearer approach it proved
to be that very Alonzo, who&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed
death had nearly proved fatal
to I&s;abella. The interview, as you
will &s;uppo&s;e, was intere&s;ting in the
extreme. I will not attempt to de|&s;cribe
it, le&s;t I &s;hould not do ju&s;tice
to &s;uch a &s;cene. Suffice it to &s;ay,
that plea&s;ure now reigns unrivalled
within the&s;e happy walls. The
e&s;cape of Alonzo was indeed nearly
miraculous! He alone, of all the
crew, e&s;caped by clinging to a plank,
and at length reached the &s;hore near|ly
<PB N="183" REF="154">
dead with fatigue. His &s;uffer|ings,
during his ab&s;ence from I&s;a|bella,
were doubtle&s;s of the &s;evere&s;t
nature. Ignorant of her fate, and
Unable to acquaint her with his
e&s;cape, he embarked for Old Spain
in the next fleet that failed; and
immediately oh his arrival, wrote to
me to prepare I&s;ebella for his return:
but unhappily the letter never ar|rived.
<HI>Unhappily,</HI> I &s;ay, becau&s;e
the &s;urpri&s;e had nearly proved fatal

may henceforth remain unal|loyed
