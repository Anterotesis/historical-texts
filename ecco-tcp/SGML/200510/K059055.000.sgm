out of his greatly benevo|lent
and truly Chri&s;tian Spirit, has comp|o&s;ed
a CATECHISM which he recommends
to my Scholars: This CATECHISM with

<HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> &s;heweth no Inclination to be

recommend it to them, not to be

<P>"LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive Velocity without
Motion, or Motion without Exten&s;ion,
or Exten&s;ion without Magnitude? If
he an&s;wers that he can, let him teach
them to do the &s;ame. If he cannot,
let him be asked, how he reconciles
the Idea of a Fluxion which he gives
(P. 13.) with common Sen&s;e? Again,
let him be asked, whether nothing be
not the Product of nothing multiply'd
by &s;omething? And if &s;o, when the
Difference between the Gnomon and
the Sum of the Rectangles vani&s;heth,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
whether the Rectangles them&s;elves do
not al&s;o vani&s;h? that is, when <HI>ab</HI> is
nothing, whether A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> be not al&s;o
nothing? that is, whether the Momen|tum
of AB be not nothing? Let him
then be asked, what his Momentums
are good for, when they are thus brought
to nothing? Again, I wi&s;h he were
asked to explain the Difference be|tween
a Magnitude infinitely &s;mall and
a Magnitude infinitely dimini&s;h'd? If
he faith there is no Difference, then
let him be asked, how he DARES to
explain the Method of Fluxions by the
<HI>Ratio</HI> of Magnitudes infinitely dimi|ni&s;h'd
(P.9.) when Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
hath expre&s;ly excluded all Con&s;idera|tion
of Quantities infinitely &s;mall? If
this able Vindicator &s;hould &s;ay that
Quantities infinitely dimini&s;h'd are no|thing
at all, and con&s;equently that,
according to him, the fir&s;t and la&s;t
<HI>Ratios</HI> are Proportions between no|things,
let him be de&s;ired to make
Sen&s;e of this or explain what he means
by '<HI>Proportion between nothings.</HI> If
he &s;hould &s;ay the ultimate Proportions
<PB N="6" REF="6">
are the Ratios of mere Limits, then
let him be asked how the Limits of
Lines can be proportioned or divided?
After all, who knows but this Gentle|man,
who hath already complained of
me for an uncommon Way of treating
Mathematics and Mathematicians, may
(as well as the <HI>Cantabrigian</HI>) cry out
<HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> when he
finds him&s;elf thus clo&s;ely pur&s;ued and
be&s;et with Interrogatories? That we
may not therefore &s;eem too hard on an
innocent Man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into Difficulties and Straits that
he was not aware of, I &s;hall propo&s;e
one &s;ingle Expedient, by which his
Di&s;ciples (whom it mo&s;t concerns) may
&s;oon &s;atisfy them&s;elves, whether this
Vindicator really under&s;tands what he
takes upon him to vindicate. It is in
&s;hort, that they would ask him to ex|plain
the &s;econd, third or fourth Fluxi|ons
upon his Principles. Be this the
Touch&s;tone of his Vindication. If he
can do it, I &s;hall own my &s;elf much
mi&s;taken: If he cannot, it will be evi|dent
<PB N="7" REF="7">
that he was much mi&s;taken in
him&s;elf, when he pre&s;umed to defend
Fluxions without &s;o much as knowing
what they are. So having put the Me|rits
of the Cau&s;e on this I&s;&s;ue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars."</P>
<P N="3">III. In this CATECHISM I am fir&s;t
to be: asked, "Whether I can conceive
Velocity without Motion, or Motion
without Exten&s;ion, or Exten&s;ion with|out
Magnitude?" The&s;e Que&s;tions are
more clearly expre&s;s'd in the 29th and
30th Queries of his <HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> where he asks,
"Whether we can form an Idea or Notion
of Velocity di&s;tinct from and exclu&s;ive
of its Mea&s;ures? Whether Motion can
be conceived in a Point of Space? And
if Motion cannot, whether Velocity
can? And if not, whether a fir&s;t or la&s;t
Velocity can be conceived in a mere Li|mit,
either initial or final, of the de&s;crib|ed
Space?" I an&s;wer, I can conceive
Velocity and Motion in a <HI>Point of Space</HI>;
that is without any a&s;&s;ignable Length or
Exten&s;ion de&s;cribed by it, and &s;o might
he too if he had under&s;tood and con&s;ider'd
<PB N="8" REF="8">
the Nature of Motion. For Moti|on
is an Effect of &s;ome Cau&s;e acting on
the Thing moved; which Effect &s;etting
a&s;ide all Re&s;i&s;tance, will ever be propor|tional
to the whole Action of the gene|rating
Cau&s;e: And therefore if a Cau&s;e
acts continually upon a given Thing with|out
any Interruption, there mu&s;t be a con|tinual
Increa&s;e of its Velocity. The Ve|locity
cannot be the &s;ame in any two
different Points of the Space de&s;cribed,
however near tho&s;e Points may be to
each other. For if it was, there mu&s;t: be
a Ce&s;&s;ation of the Action of the moving
Cau&s;e during the Pa&s;&s;age of the Thing
thro' the Space comprehended between
the two Points; which is contrary to
the Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
If the Thing moved be a Point, and
the Space de&s;cribed by this Point &s;etting
out from a State of Re&s;t at A, be AD;
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
and if the Point be acted upon con|tinually
by a moving Cau&s;e during
the Time of its going from A to D,
and the Cau&s;e act continually with
the &s;ame Degree of Strength during
that Time; the Velocity will con|tinually
increa&s;e with the Time of
the Motion, or with the Square
Root of the Space de&s;cribed; that
is, the Velocities in the Points C
and D, will be in the &s;ame Proportion
as the Times of de&s;cribing AC and AD,
or as the Square Roots of AC and AD.
The&s;e are the Laws of Motion ob&s;erved
by Bodies falling from &s;mall Heights to
the Surface of the Earth, &s;etting a&s;ide
the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air, and &s;uppo&s;ing
the Bodies to have exactly the &s;ame
Weights during the Times of their Fall.</P>
<P>If the Cau&s;e acts continually upon the
moving Point, but with different Degrees
of Strength during the Time of the Mo|tion;
the Velocity will not increa&s;e with
the Time, nor with the Square Root of the
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Space de&s;cribed; but will &s;till increa&s;e
from the Beginning to the End of the
Motion, and not be the &s;ame in any two
different Points of the Space de&s;cribed,
however near to each other. Let the
Velocity increa&s;e with the <HI>n</HI> Power of
the Time, that is, let V be as T^<HI>n</HI>; and
then V will be as <GAP DESC="math"> or as
<GAP DESC="math">, putting S for the Space de&s;crib'd:
Whence it appears that the Velocity will
not be the &s;ame in any two different
Points of the Space de&s;cribed: For it mu&s;t
vary upon the lea&s;t Change of the Space
S, and con&s;equently be different in every
different Point of AD; which &s;hews that
this Author has been greatly mi&s;taken in
imagining that there can be no Motion,
no Velocity, in a Point of Space.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The next Que&s;tions in the CA|TECHISM,
depending upon each other,
run thus. "Let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the Product of nothing
multiply'd by &s;omething? And if &s;o,
when the Difference between the Gno|mon
<PB N="11" REF="11">
and Sum of the two Rectangles
vani&s;heth, whether the Rectangles
them&s;elves do not al&s;o vani&s;h? that is
when <HI>a b</HI> is nothing, whether A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI>
be not al&s;o nothing? that is, whether
the Momentum of AB be not nothing?
And let him be asked what his Mo|mentums
are good for when thus they
are reduced to nothing?" As to the
fir&s;t of the&s;e Que&s;tions I agree with him
that nothing is the Product of nothing
multiply'd by &s;omething; but mu&s;t know
what he means by the vani&s;hing of
the Gnomon and Sum of the two
Rectangles in the &s;econd, before I give
him a direct An&s;wer. If by vani&s;hing he
means that they vani&s;h and become no|thing
as Areas, I grant they do; but ab|&s;olutely
deny, upon &s;uch an Evane&s;cence
of the Gnomon and Sum of the two Rect|angles
by the moving back of the Sides
of the Gnomon till they come to coin|cide
with tho&s;e of the Rectangle, that
nothing remains. For there &s;till remain
the moving Sides, which are now become
the Sides of the Rectangle; into which
Sides both the Gnomon and the Sum of
<PB N="12" REF="12">
the two Rectangles are now turned by
this retroverted Motion. And as the Gno|mon
and Sum of the two Rectangles, up|on
the Evane&s;cence of their Areas by
this retroverted Motion, are both con|verted
into the two Sides of the Rect|angle
AB, &s;o in the In&s;tant of that Con|ver&s;ion,
their Motions are exactly the
&s;ame; or the Motion of the Gnomon is
the &s;ame with the Sum of the Motions of
the two Rectangles, when they evane&s;ce,
and are converted into the two Sides of
the Rectangle AB.</P>
<P>If a Point moves forward to generate
a Line, and afterwards the &s;ame Point
moves back again to de&s;troy the Line
with the very &s;ame Degrees of Velocity,
in all Parts of the Line which it had in
tho&s;e Parts when moving forward to ge|nerate
it; in the In&s;tant the Line vani&s;hes
as a Length, nothing of a Line will re|main;
but &s;till the generating Point will
remain, together with the Velocity it had
at the very Beginning of its Motion. And
the Ca&s;e is the very &s;ame with re&s;pect to
a Rectangle increa&s;ing by the Motion of
<PB N="13" REF="13">
its Sides: For upon the Evane&s;cence of
a generated Gnomon, there &s;till remain
the Sides of the Rectangle into which the
Gnomon by its Evane&s;cence is converted,
together with the Velocities of tho&s;e
Sides that is, when the Gnomon eva|ne&s;ces
there &s;till remains A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>To make this more evident to Sen&s;e;
let the Point which generated the Line
AD, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> move back again from D to C with the very &s;ame Degrees of Ve|locity
in every Part of the Incre|ment
CD which it had in that part
in moving forward from C to D;
and when the Increment CD eva|ne&s;ces
and becomes nothing as a Line
by being converted into the moving
Point in C; there will remain that
that Point together with its Motion in C;
for neither the Point nor its Motion in
C is de&s;troy'd by the Evane&s;cence of the
Line CD.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">
If the Rectangle CDK be generated
by the Motions of two indefinite right
Lines IB and IA, of IB down IA and
of IA along IB, and from a Continuance
of the Motions of the&s;e Lines, be in|crea&s;ed
by the Gnomon CGK; and if
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the generating Lines return from L and E
to K and C, with the very &s;ame Degrees
of Velocity in the &s;everal Points of LK
and EC which they had in tho&s;e Points
in moving from K and C to L and E; it
is evident, when the Gnomon CGK or
the Increment of the Rectangle CDK
evane&s;ces and becomes nothing as an Area,
by being converted into the Sides DK
and DC; that there will remain tho&s;e
Sides and their Velocities in D; neither
the Sides nor the Velocities of tho&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Sides being de&s;troy'd by the Evane&s;cence
of the Area of the Gnomon. But per|haps
he will &s;ay, that when the Gnomon
evane&s;ces it turns into &s;omething more
than the Sum of the Sides DK and DC:
For the Rectangles LD and FC turn into
tho&s;e Sides, and the Rectangle FH turns
into a Point at D; and therefore the Mo|tion
of the Gnomon in the In&s;tant it eva|ne&s;ces,
will become the Sum of the Mo|tions
of the Sides DK and DC, and of
the Point in D; that is, putting A and
B for DK and DC, and <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> for the
Velocities in D towards F and H, and <HI>p</HI>
for a Point; it will be equal to A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI>
&plus; <HI>ap</HI> &plus; <HI>bp</HI>: Let it be &s;o, and yet <HI>a</HI>&plus;<HI>b</HI> &times; <HI>p</HI>
will be nothing when compared with A<HI>b</HI>
&plus; B<HI>a,</HI> nor make the lea&s;t Augmentation
to that Sum when added to it. For let
<HI>a</HI> be to <HI>b</HI> as 3 to 2, and A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>ap</HI>
&plus; <HI>bp</HI> will be 2A &plus; 3B &plus; 5<HI>p</HI>: But 5<HI>p</HI> or
five Points added to a Line, make no|thing
but the Line it&s;elf; a Point being
no Part of a Line; and con&s;equently not
in the lea&s;t increa&s;ing its Length when
added to it: And therefore the Motion
of the Gnomon when it evane&s;ces and
<PB N="16" REF="16">
turns into the Sides of the Rectangle
CDK, will be A<HI>b</HI> &plus; B<HI>a,</HI> as Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI> makes it.</P>
<P>If the Curvilineal Area ABD be gene|rated
by the Motion of any indefinite
Line AH down AG, While a Point &s;et|ting
out from A moves in the Line AH
from A towards H; and if from a Con|tinuance
of the&s;e two Motions that Area
be increa&s;ed by the Augment BDFE,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
con&s;i&s;ting of the Rectangle BC and of
the Triangle CFD; the Motion with
which the Increment BDFE begins to
be generated, is the Sum of the two Mo|tions
towards C and H in the Point D;
which Sum, putting <HI>b</HI> for the Velocity
towards C, <HI>a</HI> for the Velocity towards H
<PB N="17" REF="17">
and <HI>p</HI> for a Point, will be BD&times;<HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>ap.</HI>
Now &s;uppo&s;e the Ordinate EF to move
back to BD, and the Point F to move back
in the Line HE to C, and that in moving
back they have the &s;ame Degrees of Ve|locity
in every Point of EB and EH,
which they had before in moving for|ward;
it is manife&s;t, that when the Aug|ment
BDFE vani&s;hes and becomes no|thing
as an Area, by being converted into
the Ordinate BD, and into a Point at the
Extremity of that Ordinate; there will
remain BD and the Point in D, together
with their Velocities in that Point; for
the Motions of that Line and Point, are
not de&s;troy'd by the Evane&s;cence of the
Area BDFE, In the In&s;tant EF coin|cides
with BD, and the Point F with D,
the Area BDFE will be converted into
BD &plus; <HI>p,</HI> and its Motion will become BD &times;
<HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>pa,</HI> as before. But <HI>pa,</HI> being only &s;o
many Points as <HI>a</HI> contains Units, is real|ly
and truly nothing with re&s;pect to
BD &times; <HI>b</HI>; and con&s;equently does not at all
increa&s;e it when added to it. And there|fore
the <HI>Fluxion</HI> of the curvilineal Area
ABD, will be BD &times; <HI>b</HI>; or as BD if <HI>b</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="18">
be given, or the Line AH move down
AG with a Velocity which is exactly
the &s;ame in every Part of GA.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that if mathematical
Quantities be increa&s;ed in equal Times
by Motion, their i&s;ochronal Increments
mu&s;t be made to vani&s;h by a Retrover&s;ion
of the Motion, before we can obtain the
Motions with which they vani&s;h, or begin
to be generated; that is, before we can
obtain the <HI>Fluxions</HI> of the Quantities,
the Name given by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
to tho&s;e Motions. So then, this Author
has been much out in &s;uppo&s;ing that upon
the Evane&s;cence of the Gnomon CGK,
or of the curvilineal Figure BDFE, the
Momentum or <HI>Fluxion</HI> of the Rectangle
CDK, or of the Area ABD, vani&s;hes.
Con&s;equently, he has been greatly mi&s;ta|ken
in every one of the&s;e Que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="5">V. But he goes on. "I wi&s;h he were
asked to explain the Difference between
a Magnitude infinitely &s;mall and a Mag|nitude
infinitely dimini&s;hed. If he
&s;aith there is no Difference: Then let
<PB N="19" REF="19">
him, be further asked, how he DARES
to explain the Method of Fluxions by
the <HI>Ratio</HI> of Magnitudes infinitely di|mini&s;h'd,
when Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> hath
expre&s;ly excluded all Con&s;ideration of
Quantities infinitely &s;mall? If this able
Vindicator &s;hou'd &s;ay that Quantities
infinitely dimini&s;h'd are nothing at all,
and con&s;equently that, according to
him, the fir&s;t and la&s;t <HI>Ratios</HI> are Pro|portions

what he means by <HI>Proportion

the ultimate Proportions are the <HI>Ratios</HI>

how the Limits of Lines can be pro|portioned

<P>As all this Part of the CATECHISM
relates to the Mea&s;ures of Fluxions by

Increments generated and de&s;troy'd by
Motion, &s;o I have taken it together, and

Neither Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> nor I have

Magnitudes whatever generated in equal

a full and clear An&s;wer to this Part of
the CATECHISM, and &s;hews that its
Author has been greatly mi&s;taken in &s;up|po&s;ing
that I explained the Doctrine of
Fluxions by the <HI>Ratio of Magnitudes
infinitely demini&s;h'd,</HI> or by <HI>Proportions
between nothings.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. I come now to the la&s;t Part of
the CATECHISM, which &s;tands thus.
"I &s;hall propo&s;e one &s;ingle Expedient,
by which his Di&s;ciples (whom it mo&s;t
concerns) may &s;oon &s;atisfy them&s;elves,
whether this Vindicator really under|&s;tands
what he takes upon him to vindi|cate.
It is in &s;hort, that they wou'd ask
him to explain the &s;econd, third, or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this
<PB N="24" REF="24">
the Touch&s;tone of his Vindication:
If he can do it, I &s;hall own my &s;elf
much mi&s;taken: If he cannot it will
be evident that he was much mi&s;taken
in him&s;elf, when he <HI>pre&s;umed</HI> to de|&s;end
Fluxions without &s;o much as
knowing what they are. So having
put the Merits of the Cau&s;e on this
I&s;&s;ue, I leave him to be tried by his
Scholars."</P>
<P>I do not wonder that this Author &s;hou'd
have no clear Ideas or Conceptions of
&s;econd, third or fourth Fluxions, when
he has no clear Conceptions of the com|mon
Principles of Motion, nor of the fir&s;t
and la&s;t <HI>Ratios</HI> of the i&s;ochronal Increments
of Quantities generated and de&s;troy'd
by Motion. For Fluxions, according to Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> are the <HI>Motions</HI> with which
the i&s;ochronal Increments of Quantities be|gin
or cea&s;e to exi&s;t, or the Motions of the
generating Quantities in the very Limits
or Extremities of the <HI>Fluents</HI>: Thus
the Fluxions of Solids are the Motions of
Surfaces; the Fluxions of Surfaces, the
Motions of Lines; the Fluxions of Lines,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
the Motions of Points; and the Fluxions
of Points are nothing, for Points in their
own Nature are invariable, and therefore
incapable of being generated or increa&s;ed
by Motion: And if the fir&s;t Fluxions of
Quantities be Motions, it follows, that
the Mutations of the&s;e Motions and the
Mutations of tho&s;e Mutations, which
are the &s;econd and third Fluxions of the
Quantities, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be Motions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, &s;econd and third Fluxions do real|ly
exi&s;t, and may be clearly and di&s;tinct|ly
conceiv'd by attending to the Motions
of the &s;everal Parts of a Cube, namely,
of its Surfaces of their Lines and Points,
in the In&s;tant it begins to be increas'd by
Motion. For if A denotes the Side of a Cube
generated by an uniform Motion, who&s;e
Velocity is expre&s;s'd by <HI>a</HI>; the fir&s;t Fluxion
of the Cube, according to the&s;e Principles,
will be expre&s;&s;ed by 3<HI>a</HI>A^2; its &s;econd
Fluxion, which is the Fluxion of 3<HI>a</HI>A^2, will
be expre&s;&s;ed by 6<HI>a</HI>^2A, or by 6<HI>a</HI>A &times; <HI>a</HI>;
its third Fluxion, which is the fir&s;t Fluxi|on
on of 6<HI>a</HI>^2A, will be expre&s;s'd by 6<HI>a</HI>^3 or
by 6<HI>a</HI>^2 &times; <HI>a</HI>; and its fourth Fluxion will
<PB N="26" REF="26">
be nothing: But all the&s;e Fluxions or Mo|tions
do exi&s;t, and may be clearly and
di&s;tinctly conceived in the Motion of a
Cube, at the very End of its Generation,
or at the very Beginning of its Augmen|tation,
by Motion; for it begins to be
augmented by the Sum of the Motions
of three of its Squares comprehending
any one of its &s;olid Angles, each of which
Squares being denoted by A^2 and their
Velocity outward by <HI>a,</HI> the Fluxion of
the Cube or the Motion with which it
begins to increa&s;e or to be enlarged, will
be 3<HI>a</HI>A^2; and this is the fir&s;t Fluxion
of the Cube; and the three moving
Squares begin to be augmented, in the
very &s;ame In&s;tant wherein the Cube be|gins
to enlarge, each by the Sum of the
Motions of its two adjoining Sides, and
con&s;equently the Motions of tho&s;e Sides
to augment the cubic Surface, will be
expre&s;s'd by 6<HI>a</HI>A, but that Surface at
the &s;ame In&s;tant of Time moves outward
to augment the Solid with a Velocity
which is al&s;o denoted by <HI>a,</HI> and there|fore
the whole Motion of the fix moving
Sides of the three Squares for increa&s;ing
<PB N="27" REF="27">
or enlarging the Cube, will be expre&s;&s;ed
by 6<HI>a</HI>A &times; <HI>a</HI> or by 6<HI>a</HI>^2A; and this is the
&s;econd Fluxion of the Cube; and when
the three moving Squares begin thus to
increa&s;e, &s;ideways and outwards, for the
Enlargement of the Cube, their &s;ix mo|ving
Sides begin to be augmented by the
Motion of &s;ix Points; and the common
Velocity of tho&s;e Points in order to in|crea&s;e
the Sides of the Squares, being the
&s;ame with the Velocity of tho&s;e Sides to
increa&s;e the Cubic Surface, and with the
Velocity of that Surface to augment the
Solid; the whole Motion with which
tho&s;e Points begin to enlarge the Cube,
will be expre&s;s'd by 6<HI>a</HI>^3 or by 6<HI>a</HI>^3<HI>p</HI>; and
this is the third Fluxion of the Cube:
The&s;e three Kinds of Motion do all ne|ce&s;&s;arily
exi&s;t and may be clearly and
di&s;tinctly conceived in the Sy&s;tem of
Motion whereby a Cube begins to be
augmented: And therefore the fir&s;t, &s;e|cond
and third Fluxions of Quantities
may be di&s;tinctly conceived, and fully ex|plained
upon the Principles of Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="28">
As fir&s;t, &s;econd and third Fluxions are
explained by the &s;everal Motions nece&s;|&s;arily
exi&s;ting in the very In&s;tant a Cube
begins to be augmented, &s;o they may like|wi&s;e
be explain'd and distinctly compre|hended,
by con&s;idering the na&s;cent or
evane&s;cent Increments of the &s;everal Parts
of a Cube, generated by Motion; pro|vided
always that by na&s;cent or evane|&s;cent
Increments be under&s;tood not gene|rated
Increments of any Magnitude what|ever,
but only &s;uch Quantities or Mag|nitudes
as are proportional to and Con&s;e|quently
Mea&s;ures of the Motions with
which tho&s;e i&s;ochronal Increments begin
or cea&s;e to exi&s;t. For if <HI>a,</HI> which before
denoted Velocity, be now put for the
fir&s;t or la&s;t Ratio of the Space de&s;cribed
by that Velocity in a given Time; 3<HI>a</HI>A^2
will denote the na&s;cent Increment of the
Cube generated by the Motion of three
of its Squares comprehending any one of
its &s;olid Angles; and 6<HI>a</HI>A will expre&s;s the
Sum of the na&s;cent Increments of the
three moving Squares, which Sum mul|tiply'd
into <HI>a</HI> will be the Increment of
the na&s;cent Solid 3<HI>a</HI>A^2; con&s;equently
<PB N="29" REF="29">
6<HI>a</HI>^2A will be the &s;econd na&s;cent Incre|ment
of the Cube; and the na&s;cent In|crement
of 6A<HI>a,</HI> or of &s;ix Rectangles
each denoted by A<HI>a,</HI> will be 6<HI>a</HI>^2, which
multiply'd into <HI>a</HI> gives 6<HI>a</HI>^3 for the na&s;cent
Increment of 6<HI>a</HI>^2A, and therefore 6<HI>a</HI>^3 is
the third na&s;cent Increment of the Cube:
All this may be clearly conceiv'd and
made evident to Sen&s;e by the <HI>Figure</HI>
in <HI>Page</HI> 14. For let CDK repre&s;ent one
of the three moving Squares compre|hending
any of the &s;olid Angles of a
Cube increa&s;ing by Motion, and then
three times CDK multiply'd into <HI>a,</HI> or
3<HI>a</HI>A^2, will expound the fir&s;t na&s;cent In|crement
of the Cube; and 3FC &plus; 3LD
or 6A<HI>a</HI> (which is the na&s;cent Increment
of the three moving Squares) multiply'd
into <HI>a,</HI> will be the &s;econd na&s;cent Incre|ment
of the Cube; and, the Rectangle
FH or <HI>a</HI>^2 being the na&s;cent Increment of
the Rectangle FC or LD, and 2FH or
2<HI>a</HI>^2 the na&s;cent Increment of FC &plus; LD
or of 2A<HI>a,</HI> and 6<HI>a</HI>^2 the na&s;cent Incre|ment
of 6A<HI>a,</HI> it follows that 6<HI>a</HI>^2 multi|ply'd
into <HI>a,</HI> or that 6<HI>a</HI>^3, will be the na&s;cent
Increment of 6A<HI>a</HI>^2 and con&s;equently
<PB N="30" REF="30">
the third na&s;cent Increment of the Cube.
And the&s;e three di&s;tinct Orders of Incre|ments,
all begin to exi&s;t together, in the
very In&s;tant the Cube begins to be aug|mented
by Motion.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve as an An&s;wer to the
la&s;t Part of the CATECHISM, concern|ing
the Author's <HI>Touch&s;tone</HI> of my <HI>Vin|dication</HI>:
Whether he will <HI>own him&s;elf
mi&s;taken</HI> I know not; but I think he
ought after his unju&s;t and &s;hameful Treat|ment
of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>; who in <HI>the
Introduction to his Quadrature of
Curves,</HI> in <HI>the &s;econd Lemma of the
&s;econd Book, and in the Scholium to the
fir&s;t Section of the fir&s;t Book of his
Principles of Philo&s;ophy,</HI> has deliver'd
his Doctrine of <HI>Fluxions</HI> in &s;o clear and
di&s;tinct a Manner, without the lea&s;t <HI>In|con&s;i&s;tency</HI>
in Terms or Arguments, that
one wou'd have thought it impo&s;&s;ible for
any Per&s;on not to have under&s;tood him,
particularly for this Author, who &s;ays, <HI>he
had long and maturely con&s;idered tho&s;e
Principles, and taken as much pains as</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="31"> <HI>any Man living to under&s;tand and make
Sen&s;e of them.</HI></P>
<P>I have now done with the CATECHISM;
but beg leave before I conclude this Pa|per,
in order to prevent my being CATE|CHISED
any more by this Author, to give
the World a &s;hort Account of &s;ome Part
of my Faith in Religion. I believe that
there is one &s;upreme, incorporeal, ever|living,
intelligent and omnipre&s;ent Being,
called GOD, who made and governs the
World. I believe that GOD is endued
with infinite Power, Knowledge, Wi&s;|dom
and Goodne&s;s; and that to <HI>deny</HI> or
<HI>limit</HI> any one of the&s;e Attributes, is in
Effect to <HI>deny</HI> a GOD. I believe, that
to &s;ay GOD <HI>cannot</HI> create Spirits with a
Power, inherent in them&s;elves and re&s;ult|ing
from their own Frame and Make,
of perceiving and knowing. Things of a
quite different Nature from their own,
by Ideas and Sen&s;ations; is in Effect to
<HI>deny</HI> a GOD; for as much as by this
Principle his Almighty Power is denied.
And la&s;tly, I believe that this Supreme
Being has revealed his Will to Mankind
<PB N="32" REF="32">
by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Prophets, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>
and the Apo&s;tles; and that the Doctrine
by them deliver'd is therefore divine,
and cannot be altered by any Power or
Authority upon Earth, nor even by an
Angel from Heaven, who is pronounced
accur&s;ed &s;hou'd he preach any other <HI>Go&s;|pel</HI>
than what is delivered.</P>
