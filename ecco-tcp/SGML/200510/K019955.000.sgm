<L>Sons of the morning, fir&s;t born of creation,</L>
<L>And only le&s;s than him who marks their track,</L>
<L>And guides their fiery wheels. Here mu&s;t I &s;top,</L>
<L>Or is there aught beyond? What hand un&s;een</L>
<L>Impels me onward thro' the glowing orbs</L>
<L>Of habitable nature; far remote,</L>
<L>To the dread confines of eternal night,</L>
<L>To &s;olitudes of va&s;t unpeopled &s;pace,</L>
<L>The de&s;arts of creation, wide and wild;</L>
<L>Where embryo &s;y&s;tems and unkindled &s;uns</L>
<L>Sleep in the womb of chaos; fancy droops,</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="141">
And thought a&s;toni&s;h'd &s;tops her bold career.</L>
<L>But oh thou mighty mind! who&s;e powerful word</L>
<L>Said, thus let all things be, and thus they were,</L>
<L>Where &s;hall I &s;eek thy pre&s;ence? how unblam'd</L>
<L>Invoke thy dread perfection?</L>
<L>Have the broad eye-lids of the morn beheld thee?</L>
<L>Or does the beamy &s;houlder of Orion</L>
<L>Support thy throne? O look with pity down</L>
<L>On erring guilty man; not in thy names</L>
<L>Of terrour clad; not with tho&s;e thunders arm'd</L>
<L>That con&s;cious Sinai felt, when fear appall'd</L>
<L>The &s;catter'd tribes; thou ha&s;t a gentler voice,</L>
<L>That whi&s;pers comfort to the &s;welling heart,</L>
<L>Aba&s;h'd, yet longing to behold her Maker.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now my &s;oul unus'd to &s;tretch her powers</L>
<L>In flight &s;o daring, drops her weary wing,</L>
<L>And &s;eeks again the known accu&s;tom'd &s;pot,</L>
<L><PB N="138" REF="142">
Dre&s;t up with &s;un, and &s;hade, and lawns, and &s;treams,</L>
<L>A man&s;ion fair and &s;pacious for its gue&s;t,</L>
<L>And full replete with wonders. Let me here</L>
<L>Content and grateful, wait th' appointed time</L>
<L>And ripen for the &s;kies: the hour will come</L>
<L>When all the&s;e &s;plendours bur&s;ting on my &s;ight</L>
<L>Shall &s;tand unveil'd, and to my ravi&s;h'd &s;en&s;e</L>
<L>Unlock the glories of the world unknown.</L>
