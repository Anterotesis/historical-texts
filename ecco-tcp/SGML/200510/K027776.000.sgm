<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the following production is briefly
this. A lady, fond of blank ver&s;e, demanded
a poem of that kind from the author, and gave him
the SOFA for a &s;ubject. He obeyed; and having
much lei&s;ure, connected another &s;ubject with it;
and pur&s;uing the train of thought to which his &s;itua|tion
and turn of mind led him, brought forth at
length, in&s;tead of the trifle which he at fir&s;t intend|ed,
a &s;erious affair&mdash;a Volume.</P>
<P>In the poem, on the &s;ubject of education
he would be very &s;orry to &s;tand &s;u&s;pected of having
aimed his cen&s;ure at any particular &s;chool. His ob|jections
are &s;uch as naturally apply them&s;elves to &s;chools
in general. If there were not, as for the mo&s;t part
there is, wilful neglect in tho&s;e who manage them, and
<PB REF="4">
an omi&s;&s;ion even of &s;uch di&s;cipline as they are &s;u&s;cepti|ble
of, the objects are yet too numerous for minute at|tention;
and the aching hearts of ten thou&s;and parents
mourning under the bittere&s;t of all di&s;appointments, at|te&s;t
the truth of the allegation. His quarrel therefore is
with the mi&s;chief at large, and not with any particular
in&s;tance of it,</P>

<L>I SING the SOFA. I who lately &s;ang</L>

<L>Time was, when cloathing &s;umptuous or for u&s;e,</L>

<L>Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,</L>
<L>Fearle&s;s of wrong, repos'd his weary &s;trength.</L>
<L>Tho&s;e barb'rous ages pa&s;t, &s;ucceeded next</L>
<L>The birth-day of invention, weak at fir&s;t,</L>
<L>Dull in de&s;ign, and clum&s;y to perform.</L>
<L>Joint-&s;tools were then created; on three legs</L>

<LG>
<L>At length a generation more refined</L>
<L>Improv'd the &s;imple plan, made three legs four,</L>

<L>The &s;lipp'ry &s;eat betray'd the &s;liding part</L>

<L>Oh happy Britain! we have not to fear</L>

<HEAD>THE DIVERTING
HISTORY
OF
JOHN GILPIN,
SHEWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE
INTENDED AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>JOHN Gilpin was a citizen</L>
<L>Of credit and renown,</L>
<L>A train-band Captain eke was he</L>
<L>Of famous London town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin's &s;pou&s;e &s;aid to her dear,</L>
<L>Though wedded we have been</L>
<L>The&s;e twice ten tedious years, yet we</L>
<L>No holiday have &s;een.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="344" REF="338">
<L>To-morrow is our wedding-day,</L>
<L>And we will then repair</L>
<L>Unto the Bell at Edmonton</L>
<L>All in a chai&s;e and pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My &s;i&s;ter and my &s;i&s;ter's child,</L>
<L>My &s;elf and children three</L>
<L>Will fill the chai&s;e, &s;o you mu&s;t ride</L>
<L>On hor&s;e-back after we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;oon replied, I do admire</L>
<L>Of womankind but one,</L>
<L>And you are &s;he, my deare&s;t dear,</L>
<L>Therefore it &s;hall be done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I am a linnen-draper bold,</L>
<L>As all the world doth know,</L>
<L>And my good friend the Callender</L>
<L>Will lend his hor&s;e to go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="345" REF="339">
<L>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, that's well &s;aid;</L>
<L>And for that wine is dear,</L>
<L>We will be furni&s;h'd with our own,</L>
<L>Which is both bright and clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin ki&s;s'd his loving wife,</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd was he to find</L>
<L>That though on plea&s;ure &s;he was bent,</L>
<L>She had a frugal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning came, the chai&s;e was brought,</L>
<L>But yet was not allow'd</L>
<L>To drive up to the door, le&s;t all</L>
<L>Should &s;ay that &s;he was proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So three doors off the chai&s;e was &s;tay'd,</L>
<L>Where they did all get in,</L>
<L>Six precious &s;ouls, and all agog</L>
<L>To da&s;h through thick and thin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="346" REF="340">
<L>Smack went the whip, round went the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></L>
<L>Were never folk &s;o glad,</L>
<L>The &s;tones did rattle underneath</L>
<L>As if Cheap&s;ide were mad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>John Gilpin at his hor&s;e's &s;ide</L>
<L>Seized fa&s;t the flowing main,</L>
<L>And up he got in ha&s;te to ride,</L>
<L>But &s;oon came down again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;addle-tree &s;carce reach'd had he,</L>
<L>His journey to begin,</L>
<L>When turning round his head he &s;aw</L>
<L>Three cu&s;tomers come in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So down he came, for lo&s;s of time</L>
<L>Although it grieved him &s;ore,</L>
<L>Yet lo&s;s of pence, full well he knew,</L>
<L>Would trouble him much more:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="347" REF="341">
<L>'Twas long before the cu&s;tomers</L>
<L>Were &s;uited to their mind,</L>
<L>When Betty &s;creaming came down &s;tairs,</L>
<L>"The wine is left behind."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,</L>
<L>My leathern belt likewi&s;e</L>
<L>In which I bear my tru&s;ty &s;word</L>
<L>When I do exerci&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Mi&s;tre&s;s Gilpin, careful &s;oul,</L>
<L>Had two &s;tone bottles found,</L>
<L>To hold the liquor that &s;he loved,</L>
<L>And keep it &s;afe and &s;ound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each bottle had a curling ear</L>
<L>Through which the belt he drew,</L>
<L>And hung a bottle on each &s;ide</L>
<L>To make his balance true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="348" REF="342">
<L>Then over all, that he might be</L>
<L>Equipp'd from top to toe,</L>
<L>His long red cloak well bru&s;h'd and neat</L>
<L>He manfully did throw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;ee him mounted once again</L>
<L>Upon his nimble &s;teed,</L>
<L>Full &s;lowly pacing o'er the &s;tones</L>
<L>With caution and good heed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But finding &s;oon a &s;moother road</L>
<L>Beneath his well-&s;hod feet,</L>
<L>The &s;norting bea&s;t began to trot,</L>
<L>Which gall'd him in his &s;eat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So fair and &s;oftly, John he cried,</L>
<L>But John he cried in vain,</L>
<L>That trot became a gallop &s;oon</L>
<L>In &s;pite of curb and rein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="349" REF="343">
<L>So &s;tooping down, as needs he mu&s;t</L>
<L>Who cannot &s;it upright,</L>
<L>He gra&s;p'd the mane with both his hands</L>
<L>And eke with all his might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His hor&s;e who never in that &s;ort</L>
<L>Had handled been before,</L>
<L>What thing upon his back had got</L>
<L>Did wonder more and more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin neck or nought,</L>
<L>Away went hat and wig,</L>
<L>He little dreamt when he &s;et out</L>
<L>Of running &s;uch a rig.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</L>
<L>Like &s;treamer long and gay,</L>
<L>'Till loop and button failing both</L>
<L>At la&s;t it flew away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="350" REF="344">
<L>Then might all people well di&s;cern</L>
<L>The bottles he had &s;lung,</L>
<L>A bottle &s;winging at each &s;ide</L>
<L>As hath been &s;aid or &s;ung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dogs did bark, the children &s;cream'd;</L>
<L>Up flew the windows all,</L>
<L>And ev'ry &s;oul cried out, well done,</L>
<L>As loud as he could bawl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he;</L>
<L>His fame &s;oon &s;pread around&mdash;</L>
<L>He carries weight, he rides a race,</L>
<L>'Tis for a thou&s;and pound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;till as fa&s;t as he drew near,</L>
<L>'Twas wonderful to view</L>
<L>How in a trice the turnpike-men</L>
<L>Their gates wide open threw:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="351" REF="345">
<L>And now as he went bowing down</L>
<L>His reeking head full low,</L>
<L>The bottles twain behind his back</L>
<L>Were &s;hatter'd at a blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Down ran the wine into the road</L>
<L>Mo&s;t piteous to be &s;een,</L>
<L>Which made his hor&s;e's flanks to &s;moke</L>
<L>As they had ba&s;ted been.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;till he &s;eem'd to carry weight,</L>
<L>With leathern girdle braced,</L>
<L>For all might &s;ee the bottle necks</L>
<L>Still dangling at his wai&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all through merry I&s;lington</L>
<L>The&s;e gambols he did play,</L>
<L>And till he came unto the wa&s;h</L>
<L>Of Edmonton &s;o gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="352" REF="346">
<L>And there he threw the wa&s;h about</L>
<L>On both &s;ides of the way,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t like unto a trundling mop,</L>
<L>Or a wild-goo&s;e at play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At Edmonton his loving wife</L>
<L>From the balcony &s;pied</L>
<L>Her tender hu&s;band, wond'ring much</L>
<L>To &s;ee how he did ride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stop, &s;top John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the hou&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>They all at once did cry,</L>
<L>The dinner waits and we are tir'd,</L>
<L>Said Gilpin&mdash;&s;o am I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But yet his hor&s;e was not a whit</L>
<L>Inclined to tarry there,</L>
<L>For why? his owner had a hou&s;e</L>
<L>Full ten miles off at Ware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="353" REF="347">
<L>So like an arrow &s;wift he flew</L>
<L>Shot by an archer &s;trong,</L>
<L>So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to</L>
<L>The middle of my &s;ong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, out of breath,</L>
<L>And &s;ore again&s;t his will,</L>
<L>Till at his friend's the Callender's</L>
<L>His hor&s;e at la&s;t &s;tood &s;till.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Callender amazed to &s;ee</L>
<L>His neighbour in &s;uch trim,</L>
<L>Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,</L>
<L>And thus acco&s;ted him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What news, what news, your tidings tell,</L>
<L>Tell me you mu&s;t and &s;hall&mdash;</L>
<L>Say why bare headed you are come,</L>
<L>Or why you come at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="354" REF="348">
<L>Now Gilpin had a plea&s;ant wit</L>
<L>And loved a timely joke,</L>
<L>And thus unto the Callender</L>
<L>In merry gui&s;e he &s;poke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I came becau&s;e your hor&s;e would come,</L>
<L>And if I well forebode,</L>
<L>My hat and wig will &s;oon be here,</L>
<L>They are upon the road.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Callender right glad to find</L>
<L>His friend in merry pin,</L>
<L>Return'd him not a &s;ingle word,</L>
<L>But to the hou&s;e went in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whence &s;trait he came with hat and wig,</L>
<L>A wig that flow'd behind,</L>
<L>A hat not much the wor&s;e for wear,</L>
<L>Each comely in its kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="355" REF="349">
<L>He held them up, and in his turn</L>
<L>Thus &s;how'd his ready wit,</L>
<L>My head is twice as big as yours,</L>
<L>They therefore needs mu&s;t fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let me &s;crape the dirt away</L>
<L>That hangs upon your face,</L>
<L>And &s;top and eat, for well you may</L>
<L>Be in a hungry ca&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Said John, it is my wedding-day,</L>
<L>And all the world would &s;tare,</L>
<L>If wife &s;hould dine at Edmonton</L>
<L>And I &s;hould dine at Ware.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So turning to his hor&s;e, he &s;aid,</L>
<L>I am in ha&s;te to dine,</L>
<L>'Twas for your plea&s;ure you came here&punc;</L>
<L>You &s;hall go back for mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="356" REF="350">
<L>Ah luckle&s;s &s;peech, and bootle&s;s boa&s;t!</L>
<L>For which he paid full dear,</L>
<L>For while he &s;pake a braying a&s;s</L>
<L>Did &s;ing mo&s;t loud and clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whereat his hor&s;e did &s;nort as he</L>

<L>And gallop'd off with all his might</L>
<L>As he had done before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin and away</L>
<L>Went Gilpin's hat and wig;</L>
<L>He lo&s;t them &s;ooner than at fir&s;t,</L>
<L>For why? they were too big.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, Mi&s;tre&s;s Gilpin when &s;he &s;aw,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth did ride, and &s;oon did meet</L>

<L>But not performing what he meant</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away went Gilpin, and away</L>
<L>Went po&s;t-boy at his heels,</L>

<L>Stop thief, &s;top thief&mdash;a highwayman!</L>
<L>Not one of them was mute,</L>
