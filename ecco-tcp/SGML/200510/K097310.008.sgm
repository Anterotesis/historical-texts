<HEAD>OF MULES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[From the &s;upplementary Volume.]</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall retain the name of <HI>Mule</HI> to the animal produced by the jack-a&s;s and mare; and to that procreated between the hor&s;e and &s;he-a&s;s, we &s;hall give the denomination of
<HI>bardeau.</HI> The differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the&s;e two mongrel animals have never hitherto been marked by any author. The&s;e differences, however, afford the mo&s;t certain criterion of di&s;tingui&s;hing the relative influence of males and females in the product of generation. A compari&s;on of the&s;e two mules, and other mon|grels proceeding from a mixture of different &s;pecies, will give us more preci&s;e ideas concern|ing this relative influence, than could be obtain|ed by &s;imply comparing two individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8"> The bardeau is much &s;maller than the mule, and &s;eems to pre&s;erve the dimen&s;ions of its mo|ther, the &s;he-a&s;s; and the mule retains the di|men&s;ions of the mare. Hence, in mixed &s;pe|cies, the &s;ize of the body appears to depend more upon the mother than the father. Now, the&s;e two animals differ in figure. The neck of the bardeau is thinner, the back &s;harper, and the crupper more pointed; while the fore-head of the mule is better &s;haped, the neck more beau|tiful, the &s;ides rounder, and the crupper more plump. Hence both of the&s;e animals retain more of the mother than of the father, not only in magnitude, but in figure of body. This remark, however, does not apply to the head, limbs, and tail. The head of the bardeau is longer, and not &s;o thick in proportion as that of the a&s;s; and the head of the mule is &s;horter and thicker than that of the hor&s;e. Hence, in the figure and dimen&s;ions of the head, they have a greater re&s;emblance to the father than to the mother. The tail of the bardeau is garni&s;hed with hair nearly in the &s;ame manner as that of the hor&s;e; and the tail of the mule is almo&s;t naked, like that of the a&s;s. In this extreme part of the body, therefore, the &s;imilarity to the father pre|dominates. The ears of the mule are longer than tho&s;e of the hor&s;e; and the ears of the bardeau are &s;horter than tho&s;e of the a&s;s. The limbs of the mule are hard and limber, like tho&s;e of the hor&s;e; and the limbs of the bardeau are <PB N="3" REF="9"> more fle&s;hy. Hence the&s;e two animals, in the form of the head, limbs, and other extremities of the body, have a greater re&s;emblance to the father than to the mother.</P>
<P>In the years 1751 and 1752, I made two he|goats copulate with &s;everal ewes, and I obtain|ed nine mules, &s;even males and and two females. Struck with this difference between the number of males and females, I endeavoured to di&s;cover whether the number of male mules, produced by the a&s;s and mare, predominated in the &s;ame proportion. The information I received did not a&s;certain this point; but I learned that the num|ber of male mules always exceeded that of the females. The Marquis de Spontin-Beaufort made a dog intermix with a &s;he-wolf, and pro|cured four mules, three of which were males<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Marquis de Spontin-Beaufort to M. de Buffon, dated Namur, July 14. 1773, and atte&s;ted by two letters from M. Surirey de Boi&s;ly, likewi&s;e dated Namur, June 9. and July 19. 1773.</NOTE>. In fine, having made inquiries concerning mules which are more ea&s;ily obtained, I learned, that the number of males greatly exceeded that of the females. In the article, <HI>Canary-birds</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See tom. 4. de l'Hi&s;t. Nat. des Oi&s;eaux.</NOTE>, I remarked, that of nine young produced between a gold-finch and a Canary-bird, there were only three females. The&s;e are the only certain facts I could collect on this &s;ubject<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>What is related by different authors, concerning the ju|mars, appears to be very &s;u&s;picious. The Sicur L&eacute;ger, in his hi&s;tory of the Vaudois, tells us, 
<Q>That, in the vallies of Piedmont, there are mongrel animals, called <HI>jumars</HI>; that, when engendered by a bull and a mare, they are denomina|ted <HI>baf</HI> or <HI>buf,</HI> and when produced by a bull and a &s;he-a&s;s, they receive the appellation of <HI>bif</HI>; that the&s;e jumars have no horns, and are of the &s;ize of mules; that they are very &s;wift; that he mounted one of them on the 30th day of September, and performed, in a &s;ingle day, a journey of eighteen leagues, or fifty four Italian miles; and that they were &s;urer, and more ea&s;y than a hor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>From an a&s;&s;ertion of this kind, we would be led to believe, that the&s;e jumars, produced by the bull and the mare and &s;he-a&s;s, either exi&s;t, or did formerly exi&s;t; yet I have never been able to di&s;cover any confirmation of the&s;e facts.</P>
<P>Dr Shaw, in his hi&s;tory of Algiers, p. 166. &s;ays, 
<Q>To the mule we may join the <HI>Kumrab,</HI> as the Algerines call a little &s;erviceable bea&s;t of burden, begot betwixt an a&s;s and a cow. That which I &s;aw at Algiers (where it was not looked upon as a rarity), was &s;ingle hoofed, like the a&s;s, but di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from it, in having a &s;leeker &s;kin, with the tail and the head (though without horns) in fa&s;hion of the dam's.</Q>
Dr Shaw is an author who de&s;erves credit. However, having con&s;ulted &s;everal per&s;ons who had been in Barbary, and par|ticularly the Chevalier James Bruce, they all a&s;&s;ured me, that they had no knowledge concerning the&s;e animals engendered by an a&s;s and a cow.</P></NOTE>, which merits <PB N="4" REF="10"> more attention than it has yet received; for the my&s;teries of generation by the concour&s;e of dif|ferent &s;pecies, and the a&s;certaining of the pro|portional effective powers of males and females in every kind of reproduction, can alone be de|veloped by an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;imilar facts.</P>
<P>Of my nine mules produced by the he-goat and the ewes, the fir&s;t was brought forth on the 15th day of April. When examined three days <PB N="5" REF="11"> after birth, and compared with lambs of the &s;ame age, it differed from them in the following particulars: The ears, upper part of the head, as well as the di&s;tance between the eyes, were larger. It had, be&s;ides, a band of whiti&s;h gray hair from the nap of the neck to the extremity of the tail. The four legs, the &s;uperior part of the neck, the brea&s;t, and belly, were covered with the &s;ame white, coar&s;e hair. There was a &s;mall quantity of wool upon the flanks only; and even this &s;hort, curled wool, was mixed with a great deal of hair. The legs of this mule were al&s;o a foot and a half longer than tho&s;e of a lamb of the &s;ame age. When examined, eighteen days after birth, the white hairs were partly fallen off, and replaced by brown hairs, &s;imilar in colour to tho&s;e of the he-goat, and nearly as coar&s;e. The limbs continued to be more than a foot and a half longer than tho&s;e of the lamb; and, on account of this length of limbs, it did not walk &s;o well as the lamb. This lamb was killed by an accident; and I took no far|ther notice of the mule till four months after|ward, when I compared it with a &s;heep of the &s;ame age. In the mule, from the &s;pace between the eyes to the extremity of the muzzle, the di|&s;tance was at lea&s;t an inch &s;horter than in the &s;heep; and the head of the mule was more than half an inch broader, at the broade&s;t part. Hence the head of this mule was thicker and &s;horter than that of a &s;heep of equal age. The curva|ture <PB N="6" REF="12"> of the upper jaw, taken from the corner of the mouth, was near half an inch longer in the mule than in the &s;heep. The head of the mule was not covered with wool, but with long, bu&s;hy hair. The tail was two inches &s;horter than that of the &s;heep.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1752, I obtained, from the union of a he-goat with ewes, eight o|ther mules, &s;ix of which were males, and two females. Two of them died before I could ex|amine them; but they &s;eemed to re&s;emble tho&s;e who &s;urvived. Two of them, a male and a fe|male, had four teats, two on each &s;ide, like tho&s;e of the goats. In general, the&s;e mules had long hair on the belly, and particularly about the pe|nis, as in the he-goat, and al&s;o on the feet, and particularly tho&s;e behind. Mo&s;t of them had the chanfrin le&s;s arched than is common to lambs, the di&s;tance between the hoofs larger, and the tail &s;horter.</P>
<P>Under the article <HI>Dog,</HI> I related &s;ome experi|ments made with a view to procure an intermix|ture between a dog and a wolf, where all the precautions employed for that purpo&s;e were a|bortive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. p. 24.</NOTE>. The conclu&s;ion drawn from the&s;e ex|periments was in the following words: 'I pre|tend not ab&s;olutely to affirm, that the wolf, in no age or country, never intermixed with dogs. The contrary is a&s;&s;erted po&s;itively by the antients. Ari&s;totle remarks, that, though <PB N="7" REF="13"> animals of different &s;pecies &s;eldom intermix; yet it certainly happens among dogs, foxes, and wolves.' I have &s;ince learned the propri|ety of being thus cautious in my conclu&s;ions; for M. le Marquis de Spontin-Beaufort has &s;uc|ceeded in the junction of a dog and a wolf. I was informed of this fact by M. Surirey de Boi&s;|&s;y, in a letter which he wrote me in the follow|ing terms:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Namur,</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 9. 1773.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>The Marquis de Spontin has in this place reared a very young &s;he-wolf, to whom he gave, as a companion, a dog of nearly the &s;ame age. They were left at full liberty, and came into the apartments, the kitchen, the &s;table, &amp;c. They live in the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip, and are extremely care&s;&s;ing, lying under the table, and upon the feet of the per&s;ons who &s;it round it.</P>
<P>The dog is a kind of mongrel ma&s;tiff, and full of vigour. During the fir&s;t &s;ix months, the wolf was fed with milk, and afterward with raw fle&s;h, which it preferred to what was roa&s;ted. When &s;he eat, no per&s;on dur&s;t ap|proach her. At other times, &s;he permitted e|very freedom, except abu&s;e. She care&s;&s;ed all the dogs which came near her, till &s;he began to give a preference to her old companion; af|ter which, &s;he was enraged at every other. She was covered, for the fir&s;t time, on the 25th day of March la&s;t. Her amours continued fifteen days, with pretty frequent repetitions; <PB N="8" REF="14"> and &s;he brought forth her young on the &s;ixth day of June at eight o'clock in the morning. Hence the time of her ge&s;tation was &s;eventy-three days. The young were four in number, and of a blacki&s;h colour. Some of them have the half of the brea&s;t, and the pats, white. The&s;e colours are derived from the dog, who is black and white. From the moment of lit|tering, &s;he growled and attacked all who ap|proached her. She no longer di&s;tingui&s;hed her ma&s;ters; and would even have devoured the dog, if he had come near her.</P>
<P>I add, that &s;he has been chained ever &s;ince &s;he made a break at her gallant, who had leap|ed a neighbouring wall, in order to come at a bitch in &s;ea&s;on; that &s;he nearly worried his ri|val; and that the coachman &s;eparated them by repeated blows of a large bludgeon, and con|ducted her to her lodge, where, imprudently commencing his cha&s;ti&s;ement, her fury ro&s;e to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he bit him twice in the thigh, and the wounds confined him &s;ix weeks to his bed.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In my an&s;wer to this letter, I thanked M. de Boi&s;&s;y, and added &s;ome remarks, with a view to remove my doubts. M. le Marquis de Spon|tin having &s;een my an&s;wer, obligingly wrote me in the following terms:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Namur,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 14. 1773.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I read with much &s;atisfaction the judicious remarks you tran&s;mitted to M. Surirey de Boi&s;&s;y, whom I <PB N="9" REF="15"> had begged to communicate to you, during my ab&s;ence, a fact, which cannot be denied, notwith&s;tanding the force of your arguments, and the opinion I have always entertained, as well as the re&s;t of the world, of the excellence of the many learned productions by which you have enlightened the republic of letters. But, whether it was an effect of chance, or one of tho&s;e &s;ports of Nature, who, as you remark, &s;ometimes departs from her e&s;tabli&s;h|ed laws, the fact is inconte&s;tible; and you will be convinced of its truth, if you give cre|dit to what I have the honour of writing you, which can be atte&s;ted by two hundred per&s;ons at lea&s;t, who were witne&s;&s;es to it as well as my&s;elf. This &s;he-wolf was only three days old when I purcha&s;ed it from a pea&s;ant, who had carried it off, after killing the mother. I fed it with milk till it was able to eat fle&s;h. I recommended to tho&s;e who had the care of it, to care&s;s, and handle it often, with a view to render it as tame as po&s;&s;ible. At la&s;t, it be|came &s;o familiar that I have taken it to hunt in the woods at the di&s;tance of a league from my hou&s;e, without any danger of lo&s;ing it. Sometimes, when I was unable to call it back, it returned of its own accord in the night. I was always more certain of keeping it at home when I had a dog; for it was fond of dogs; and tho&s;e, who had overcome their natural re|pugnance, &s;ported with it, as if they had been <PB N="10" REF="16"> animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. During all this time, it attacked only cats and poultry, whom it &s;trangled, without di&s;covering any inclina|tion to eat them. As &s;oon as &s;he attained the age of twelve months, her ferocity increa&s;ed, and I began to perceive that &s;he had a &s;trong de&s;ire to attack &s;heep and bitches. I then chained her; becau&s;e &s;he frequently &s;prung up|on her ma&s;ter, when he attempted to re&s;train her. &s;he was at lea&s;t one year old when I in|troduced her to the acquaintance of the dog who covered her. She has been kept in my gar|den, which is &s;ituated in the centre of the town, &s;ince the end of November la&s;t; and, therefore, no male wolf can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had any communication with her. As &s;oon as &s;he came in &s;ea&s;on, &s;he di&s;covered &s;uch an affection for the dog, and the dog for her, that each of them howled frightfully when they were not together. She was fir&s;t cover|ed on the 28th day of March, and twice each day during the two following weeks. They continued attached to each other more than a quarter of an hour at every embrace, during which time the wolf complained, and &s;eemed to &s;uffer pain; but the dog was perfectly at his ea&s;e. Three weeks after, her pregnancy was perceptible. On the 6th day of June, &s;he brought forth four young, whom &s;he &s;till &s;uckles, though they are five weeks old, and have pretty long &s;harp teeth. They have a <PB N="11" REF="17"> perfect re&s;emblance to puppies, having long pendulous ears. One of them is black, with a white brea&s;t, which was the colour of the dog. The others will probably be of the colour of the mother. The hair of each of them is cour&s;er than that of ordinary dogs. There is but one female, with a very &s;hort tail, like the dog, who had &s;carcely any tail. They promi&s;e to be large, &s;trong, and very ferocious. The mother is extremely &s;olicitous concerning their wellfare. . . . . . I doubt whether I &s;hall keep her any longer, having been chagrined by an accident that befell my coachman, whom &s;he bit &s;o cruelly, that he has been confined to his bed the&s;e &s;ix weeks pa&s;t. But I will engage, that, if pre&s;er|ved, &s;he will again have puppies by the &s;ame dog, who is white, with large black &s;pots on the back. I hope, Sir, that what I have &s;aid will an&s;wer for a reply to your remarks, and that you will no longer he&s;itate concerning the truth of this &s;ingular event.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>My doubts are entirely removed, and I am happy to embrace this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing my thanks. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a rare fact in natural hi&s;tory is a great acqui&s;ition. The means of obtaining &s;uch facts are always difficult, and often, as we have &s;een, very dangerous. It was for this la&s;t rea&s;on that I feque&s;tered my wolf and dog from all &s;ociety. I had formerly rear|ed a young wolf, who, till the age of twelve months, did no mi&s;chief, and followed his ma|&s;ter <PB N="12" REF="18"> like a dog. But, in the &s;econd year, he committed &s;o many exce&s;&s;es that it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to kill him. I learned by experience, that the&s;e animals, though &s;oftened by education, re|&s;ume, with age, their natural ferocity. Willing to prevent the&s;e inconveniences, I kept my &s;he|wolf always confined along with the dog; and I acknowledge that this method of procuring an union between them, was ill imagined; for, in this &s;tate of &s;lavery and di&s;gu&s;t, the di&s;po&s;itions of the wolf, in&s;tead of being &s;oftened, were &s;oured to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he was more fe|rocious than if &s;he had been at full liberty; and the dog, having been early detached from his equals, and from the &s;ociety of men, had a&s;&s;u|med a &s;avage and cruel character, which the bad humour of the wolf &s;erved only to augment; &s;o that, during the two la&s;t years, their antipa|thy ro&s;e to &s;uch a degree, that they de&s;ired no|thing &s;o much as to devour each other. In the experiment made by the Marquis de Spontin, every circum&s;tance was rever&s;ed. The dog was in his ordinary condition: He had all the mild|ne&s;s and other qualities which this docile animal acquires by his intercour&s;e with man. The wolf was likewi&s;e reared in perfect freedom and fa|miliarity along with the dog, which, by being under no re&s;traint, had lo&s;t his repugnance to her; and &s;he, by the &s;ame mild management, became &s;u&s;ceptible of attachment to him. She, therefore, received him with cordiality, whenever <PB N="13" REF="19"> the hour of Nature &s;truck: And, though &s;he &s;eemed to complain and to &s;uffer, &s;he felt more plea&s;ure than pain; for &s;he allowed the opera|tion to be repeated every day, during all the time &s;he was in &s;ea&s;on. Be&s;ides, the proper moment for this unnatural union was &s;eized. The wolf felt the impre&s;&s;ion of love for the fir&s;t time. She was only in the &s;econd year of her age; and, of cour&s;e, had not entirely re&s;umed her natural ferocity.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances, and perhaps &s;ome others which were not ob&s;erved, contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of this fertile embrace. From what has been remarked, it would appear, that the mo&s;t certain method of rendering animals un|faithful to their &s;pecies, is to place them, like man, in &s;ociety, and to accu&s;tom them gradual|ly to individuals which, without &s;uch precau|tions, would not only be indifferent, but ho&s;tile to each other. However this matter &s;tands, the Marquis de Spontin has a&s;certained the fact, that the dog can produce with the wolf even in our climates. I could have wi&s;hed that the &s;ucce&s;s of this experiment had induced its author to try the union of a wolf with a bitch, and of foxes with dogs. But if this de&s;ire &s;hould be con&s;ider|ed as exorbitant, he mu&s;t a&s;cribe it to the in&s;a|tiable enthu&s;ia&s;m of a naturali&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;imilar fact has been announced by M. Bourgelat, in a letter to me, dated April 15. 1775: 'My Lord Pembroke,' &s;ays he, 'informed me, that, within the&s;e few days, he &s;aw a large ma&s;tiff copulate with a &s;he-wolf; that the wolf is tame; that &s;he is always in her ma&s;ter's chamber, and con|&s;equently under his eye; that &s;he never goes out alone; and that &s;he follows her ma&s;ter with all the fidelity of a dog. He adds, that an animal merchant has had, at four different times, mules produced by the wolf and dog. He alledges, that the wolf is only a wild dog; and in this opi|nion he is joined by the celebrated anatomi&s;t Mr Hunter. He thinks differently with regard to the fox. He tells me, that a bitch, who was a daughter of a wolf, and belonged to Lord Clanbrazil, intermixed with a &s;etting dog, and produced puppies, which, according to his hunter, will be excellent pointers.'</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20"> But to return to our mules. In tho&s;e I ob|tained from the he-goat and ewe, the number of males was as &s;even to two; in tho&s;e from the dog and &s;he-wolf, the males were as three to one; and, in tho&s;e from the goldfinch and Ca|nary bird, the mules were as &s;ixteen to three. It appears, therefore, to be certain, that the number of males, which is always greater than that of females in pure &s;pecies, is &s;till greater in mixed &s;pecies. Hence, the male, in general, has a greater influence on the produce of gene|ration than the female, becau&s;e he tran&s;mits his &s;ex to the greate&s;t number, and becau&s;e the number of males augments in proportion to the remotene&s;s of the &s;pecies who intermix. The &s;ame thing mu&s;t happen in the conjunction of different races: By cro&s;&s;ing the remote&s;t of the&s;e, we will not only procure the mo&s;t beautiful productions, but the greate&s;t number of males. <PB N="15" REF="21"> I have often endeavoured to inve&s;tigate the rea|&s;on why any religion, or any government, &s;hould prohibit the marriage of brothers and &s;i&s;ters. Did men learn, by very antient expe|rience, that the union of brother and &s;i&s;ter was le&s;s fertile than an intermixture with &s;trangers, or that the former produced fewer males, and feebler and more unhand&s;ome children? It is certain, however, that, from a thou&s;and experi|ments, both in men and the other animals, cro&s;&s;ing the breed is the only mode of ennobling and pre&s;erving the perfection of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>To the&s;e facts and experiments, let us add what the antients have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject. Ari&s;totle tells us, that the mule engenders with the mare, and that the junction produces an ani|mal which the Greeks called <HI>hinnus</HI> or <HI>ginnus.</HI> He likewi&s;e remarks, that the &s;he-mule ea&s;ily conceives, but &s;eldom brings the foetus to per|fection
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. animal. lib. 6. cap. 24.</NOTE>. Of the&s;e two facts, the &s;econd is more rare than the fir&s;t; and both happen only in warm climates. M. de Bory, of the royal aca|demy of Sciences, and formerly governour of the American i&s;lands, communicated to me a re|cent fact of this kind, in a letter, dated May 7. 1770, of which the following is an extrat.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>You will perhaps recollect, Sir, that M. d' Almbert read, la&s;t year, in the Academy of Sciences, a letter, which informed him, that a &s;he-mule, in the i&s;land of St Domingo, <PB N="16" REF="22"> had brought forth a foal. I was de&s;ired to write for proper vouchers of the fact; and I have now the honour of &s;ending you the certi|ficate which I received. . . . . My corre&s;pon|dent is worthy of the highe&s;t credit. He adds, that he has &s;een mules cover, indi&s;criminately, &s;he-mules and mares, and likewi&s;e &s;he-mules covered by &s;tallions and he-mules.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This certificate is judicially atte&s;ted, and &s;ign|ed by witne&s;&s;es of unque&s;tionable veracity. The &s;ub&s;tance of it is, that, on the 14th day of May 1769, M. de Nort, Knight of St Louis, and late Major of the Royal Legion of St Domingo, had a &s;he-mule brought to him, which was &s;aid to be &s;ick; that her belly was remarkably large, and a membrance protruded through the vagina. M. de Nort, believing the animal to be inflated, &s;ent for a Negro farrier, who had been accu&s;tom|ed to take care of di&s;ea&s;ed animals; that this Negro, who arrived in the ab&s;ence of M. de Nort, had thrown down the mule, in order to give her a draught; that, the moment after the fall, &s;he brought forth a young mule, perfectly formed, and covered with long and very black hair; that the young mule lived an hour; but that, having been both hurt by the fall, and foal died &s;oon after birth, and the mother ten hours after; and, in fine, that the young mule was &s;kinned, and the &s;kin &s;ent, &s;ays M. de Nort, to Doctor Matty, who depo&s;ited it in the Mu&s;aeum of the Royal Society at London.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23"> Other eye-witne&s;&s;es, and particularly M. Caza|vant, &s;urgeon, add, that the young mule &s;eemed to have been mature, and well formed; that, from the appearance of its hair, head, and ears, it had a greater re&s;emblance to the a&s;s than com|mon mules; that the paps of the mother were &s;welled, and full of milk; that, when the igno|rant Negro perceived the feet i&s;&s;uing from the vagina, he drew &s;o forcibly as to invert the uterus, and lacerate the parts, which occa&s;ioned the death of both mother and foal.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, which appear to be well a&s;cer|tained, demon&s;trate, that, in warm climates, the mule is not only capable of conception, but of bringing the foetus to full maturity. From my corre&s;pondents in Spain and Italy, I learn, that &s;imilar events have happened in the&s;e countries: But the facts are not &s;o completely authenticated. It &s;till remains to be inquired, whether this St Domingo mule was impregnated by an a&s;s or a mule. The &s;uperior re&s;emblance of the young mule to the former &s;eems to indicate, that &s;he had been covered by an a&s;s. The ferocious ar|dour of the a&s;s renders him very indifferent in the choice of females, and makes him attack, with nearly the &s;ame avidity, the &s;he-a&s;s, the mare, and the mule.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, con&s;ider it as an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed fact, that the he-mule can generate, and the &s;he-mule produce. Like other animals, they have a &s;eminal liquor, and all the organs nece&s;|&s;ary <PB N="18" REF="24"> to generation. But mongrel animals are always le&s;s fertile, and more tardy than tho&s;e of a pure &s;pecies. Be&s;ides, mules have never pro|duced in cold climates, &s;eldom in warm regions, and &s;till more &s;eldom in temperate countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To the above facts, the Tran&s;lator has to add an in&s;tance of the prolific powers of a &s;he mule in the North of Scotland. Having heard that a mule, belonging to Mr. David Tullo, farmer in Auchtertyre, in the county of Forfar, had &s;ome years ago brought forth a foal, he tran&s;mitted a few queries to be put to Mr Tullo; and reque&s;ted that his an&s;wers might be legally atte&s;ted before a magi&s;trate. This reque&s;t was chearfully complied with; and the following is an exact copy of the queries, an&s;wers, and atte&s;tations.</P>

<P>Interrogatories to be put to Mr Tullo tenant in Auchtertyre, pari&s;h of Newtyle, and county of Forfar, with his an&s;wers thereto.</P>
<P>1<HI>mo,</HI> Had you ever a &s;he-mule? At what period? Is it true that the mule had a foal? At what time was &s;he covered; and when did &s;he foal?</P>
<P>An&s;wered by Mr Tullo: That he bought a &s;he-mule about twenty years ago: That &s;he was con&s;tantly in &s;ea&s;on for a hor&s;e: That, about &s;ome years thereafter, he gave her a hor&s;e; and that &s;he, thereafter, gave him a foal, about the 10th of June. The mule's price was four pounds five &s;hillings Ster|ling.</P>
<P>2<HI>do,</HI> What was the colour of the foal? Was there any thing particular in its figure?</P>
<P>An&s;wer: The foal was exactly the colour of its mother, inclined to black, with a very large head, big ears, and &s;mall tail; and the declarant thinks, had its head been weighed when foaled, it would have weighted nearly as much as its body.</P>
<P>3<HI>tio,</HI> How long was the animal allowed to live?</P>
<P>An&s;wer: The next day after the mule foaled, it was &s;ent, with its mother, to the Loch of Lundie, in order to let the foal die, as the declarant could not want the mule's work, and the mother &s;eemed not fond of the foal: That it was accor|dingly left, and next day came to Auchtertyre, about two miles di&s;tance, over a hill, with the cattle of Auchtertyre. that had been grazing near to that place, and was drowned in a ditch the day following.</P>
<P>4<HI>to,</HI> Was its &s;kin pre&s;erved, or the head, or any other bones of the &s;keleton? Could any part thereof be &s;till found?</P>
<P>An&s;wered: neither the &s;kin, nor any part of the &s;keleton was pre&s;erved, nor can now be had; though the declarant has often regretted the not pre&s;erving the foal, as its mother always performed any work that a hor&s;e of fifteen pounds value could do.</P>
<P>5<HI>to,</HI> Is the mother &s;till alive? What is her age?</P>
<P>An&s;wer: The mother died, about eight years ago, of an epidemic cold that was raging among the hor&s;es in this country: The mule had little or no milk after foaling, and the foal got &s;ome cow's milk: And this is all that he remem|bers of the matter.</P>

<P>The original atte&s;tation is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Tran&s;la|tor; and he lately tran&s;mitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">otorial or authenticated copies of it to the Count de Buffon, and to Thomas Pennant, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Downing, in Flint&s;hire.</P></NOTE>. Hence their barrenne&s;s, without being ab&s;olute, <PB N="19" REF="25"> may be regarded as po&s;itive; &s;ince their produc|tions are &s;o rare, that a few examples only can <PB N="20" REF="26"> be collected. But men were wrong in a&s;&s;erting that mules were ab&s;olutely barren, and that all animals proceeding from a mixture of different &s;pecies were, like the mules, incapable of pro|ducing. The facts formerly related concerning the produce of a he-goat and a ewe, of a dog and a &s;he-wolf, and of Canary birds and gold-finches, demon&s;trate, that the&s;e mongrels are by no means barren, and that &s;ome of them are equally pro|lific with their parents.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy circum&s;tance, that a &s;mall, and often nominal error, extends over every ob|ject to which it has any relation, and at la&s;t not only becomes in an error in fact, but gives ri&s;e to a general prejudice, that is more difficult to re|move than the particular opinion from which it originated. A &s;ingle word, a name like that of
<HI>mule,</HI> which ought &s;olely to repre&s;ent the idea of the animla proceeding from the a&s;s and mare, has been improperly applied to the ani|mal produced by the hor&s;e and the &s;he-a&s;s, and afterward, with &s;till greater impropriety, to all quadrupeds, and all birds, of mixed &s;pecies: And, <PB N="21" REF="27"> as this word <HI>mule,</HI> in its original acceptation, in|cluded the idea of the barrenne&s;s common to the animal proceeding from the a&s;s and mare, this idea of barrenne&s;s has been conveyed to all be|ings who have the denomination of <HI>mules</HI>; I &s;ay to all beings; for, independent of quadru|peds, birds, and fi&s;hes, mule plants have been fancied, to which, without he&s;itation, this gene|ral &s;terility has al&s;o been a&s;cribed. None of the&s;e beings, however, is ab&s;olutely barren. The
<HI>mule,</HI> properly &s;o called, or the animal produced by the a&s;s mare, is not ab&s;olutely barren; but its prolific powers, when compared with tho&s;e of pure &s;pecies, or even with tho&s;e of other animals of a mixed &s;pecies, are much more feeble and uncertain.</P>
<P>All mules, &s;ays Prejudice, are vitiated ani|mals, incapable of producing: No animal, &s;ays Rea&s;on and Experience, though proceeding from two &s;pecies, is ab&s;olutely barren. It ought to be remarked, however, that, in pure, as well as mixed &s;pecies, the degrees of fertility are very different. In the fir&s;t, &s;ome, like the fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, multiply, annually, by millions; others, as the birds and &s;mall quadrupeds, produce by twenties and dozens; in fine, others, as man, and the larger quadrupeds, produce only one in twelve months. The number produced may be &s;aid to be in the inver&s;e proportion of the mag|nitude of animals. The hor&s;e and a&s;s bring forth but one in a year; and, in the &s;ame pe|riod, <PB N="22" REF="28"> the mou&s;e and Guinea pig produce thirty or forty. Hence the fecundity of the&s;e &s;mall animals is thirty or forty times greater; and, if a &s;cale were formed of the different degrees of fertility, the &s;mall animals above enumerated would occupy the highe&s;t points, while the hor&s;e and a&s;s would be found nearly in the lowe&s;t; for the elephant alone is le&s;s fertile.</P>
<P>In mixt &s;pecies, there are al&s;o differnt de|grees of fecundity; for animals proceeding from two &s;pecies partake of two natures, and are, in general, le&s;s fertile; and this want of fertility increa&s;es in proportion to the infecun|dity of the parents. Hence, if the hor&s;e and a&s;s, two animals naturally not very fertile, mix, the original infecundity, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing in the mongrel race, mu&s;t be augemented. The mule will not only be le&s;s fertile than its parents, but, perhaps, the mo&s;t unfertile of all mongrels; becau&s;e all the other mules which produce, &s;uch as tho&s;e proceeding from the he-goat and ewe, from the goldfinch and Canary bird, &amp;c. are much more fruitful than the a&s;s and hor&s;e. It is to this original and particular cau&s;e, that the infe|cundity of the mule and bardeau &s;hould be re|ferred. A &s;econd cau&s;e, &s;till more particular, renders the la&s;t animal le&s;s prolific than the fir&s;t. The mule proceeding from the a&s;s and mare re|tains the ardent temperament of the father, and, of cour&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a high degree of prolific power; while the bardeau proceeding from the <PB N="23" REF="29"> hor&s;e and a&s;s is, like its father, le&s;s potent, and le&s;s able to engender. Be&s;ides, the mare being le&s;s ardent than the &s;he-a&s;s, is likewi&s;e more fer|tile, &s;ince &s;he conceives and retains with more certainty. Thus every circum&s;tance concurs in rendering the mule more prolific than the bar|deau; for ardour of temperament in the male, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;sful generation and the number produced, is hurtful in the fe|male, and almo&s;t always prevents conception and retention.</P>
<P>This fact holds generally both in man and the other animals. Cold women, joined to ardent men, produce a number of children. A woman, on the contrary, who feels too acutely the emo|tions of love, is &s;eldom fertile. But, in mo&s;t women who are merely pa&s;&s;ive, the effect is more certain; becau&s;e the fruit of generation is le&s;s di&s;turbed by the convul&s;ions of plea&s;ure. The&s;e are &s;o marked, and &s;o de&s;tructive to conception, in &s;ome females, &s;uch as the &s;he|a&s;s, that &s;he requires cold water to be thrown on her crupper, and even heavy blows, in or|der to repre&s;s them. Without &s;uch di&s;agreeable aids, the &s;he-a&s;s would never be impregnated, till age abated the fury of her pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame means are &s;ometimes employed to make mares conceive.</P>
<P>But, it may be &s;aid, that female dogs and cats, who &s;eem to be more ardent than the mare and &s;he-a&s;s, never fail to conceive; and, there|fore, <PB N="24" REF="30"> that the fact advanced concerning the in|fecundity of females who&s;e feelings are exqui|&s;ite, is too general, and admits of many excep|tions. But the example of dogs and cats, in|&s;tead of being an exception, is rather a confir|mation of the general rule; for, in the bitch, however violent the convul&s;ions of the internal organs may be &s;uppo&s;ed, they have full time to be appea&s;ed during the long interval between con&s;ummation and the retreat of the male, who cannot detach him&s;elf till the turgidity and irri|tation of the parts &s;ub&s;ide. The female cat is in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Of all females, &s;he ap|pears to be the mo&s;t ardent in her amours; for &s;he calls to the males with lamentable cries, which announce the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity. But, as in the dog, from a particular conforma|tion of the male cat, this violent female never mi&s;&s;es conception. Her de&s;ires, which are exce&s;|&s;ive, are nece&s;&s;arily tempered with a pain almo&s;t equally acute. The glans of the male cat is co|vered with large &s;harp prickles. The intro|mi&s;&s;ion of it, therefore, mu&s;t be extremely pain|ful to the female, who announces her &s;ufferings by loud cries. The pain is &s;o great, that &s;he in&s;tantly makes every effort to e&s;cape, and the male, to retain her, is obliged to &s;eize her by the neck with his teeth, and to compell &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the very female who had invited his em|braces</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31"> In dome&s;tic animals, who are well fed and taken care of, multiplication is greater than in tho&s;e who continue in a wild &s;tate. Of this we have an example in dome&s;tic dogs and cats, who produce &s;everal times every year; but, when in a natural &s;tate, they produce only once in the &s;ame period. Dome&s;tic birds furni&s;h an example &s;till more &s;triking: Can the fecundity of any &s;pecies of wild birds be compared to that of a well fed hen, when properly &s;erved with a cock? And, even in the human &s;pecies, what a va&s;t difference betwen the &s;canty propagation of &s;a|vages, and the immen&s;e population of civilized nations, under the admini&s;tration of a wi&s;e go|vernment? But we here confine our&s;elves to the fecundity natural to animals in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, the relative fertility of whom is exhi|bited in the following Table, from which &s;ome important conclu&s;ions may be drawn.</P>

<P><PB N="30" REF="36"> This is the order in which Nature has pre&s;ent|ed to us the different degrees of fecundity in quadrupeds; and from it we perceive, that this fecundity dimini&s;hes in proportion to the mag|nitude of the animal. In general, this &s;ame &s;cale of fecundity extends to all the other tribes of animated Nature. Small birds are more prolific than the larger kinds. The &s;ame thing holds in fi&s;hes, and perhaps in in&s;ects. But, confining our remarks to quadrupeds alone, it appears from the above table, that the hog is the only excep|tion to the general rule; for, from the &s;ize of his body, he &s;hould be ranked with tho&s;e ani|mals which produce only two or three, once in twelve months, while, in fact, he is equally pro|lific with the &s;mall quadrupeds.</P>
<P>This table contains all that is known with re|gard to the fertility of pure &s;pecies. But the fecundity of mixed &s;pecies, which is always le&s;s than that of the pure, merits particular atten|tion. The rea&s;on will be apparent, by &s;uppo|&s;ing, for example, that all the males in the hor&s;e &s;pecies, and all the &s;he-a&s;&s;es, or, rather, all the jack-a&s;&s;es and all the mares, were de&s;troyed: In this ca&s;e, tho&s;e mixed animals alone, which we call <HI>mules</HI> and <HI>bardeaux,</HI> would be produced; and the number brought forth would be much fewer than that of hor&s;es or a&s;&s;es; becau&s;e the natural conformities or relations between the hor&s;e and &s;he-a&s;s, or between the jack-a&s;s and mare, are le&s;s than between the hor&s;e and mare, or the male <PB N="31" REF="37"> and female a&s;s. It is the number of conformi|ties and di&s;&s;imilarities which con&s;titutes or di&s;tin|gui&s;hes &s;pecies; and, &s;ince the &s;pecies of the a&s;s has at all times been &s;eparated from that of the hor&s;e, it is apparent, that, by mixing the&s;e two &s;pecies, whether by means of females or males, we dimini&s;h the number of conformities which con&s;titute the &s;pecies. Hence the males will en|gender and the females produce &s;eldomer, and with more difficulty; and even tho&s;e mixed &s;pecies, if their conformities were fewer, would become entirely barren. Mules of every kind, there|fore, mu&s;t be rare; becau&s;e it is only from be|ing deprived of its natural female, that any ani|mal will intermix with a female of a different &s;pecies. Even when mongrel animals approach each other with &s;ome degree of warmth, their produce is neither &s;o certain nor &s;o frequent as in pure &s;pecies, where the number of conformi|ties is greater. Now, the produce of mixed &s;pe|cies will be le&s;s frequent, in proportion to the infecundity of the pure &s;pecies from whom they proceed; and the produce of animals proceed|ing from mixed &s;pecies will always dimini&s;h in proportion as they recede from the original &s;tock; becau&s;e the conformities between them and any other animal are augmented. For example, I am per&s;uaded, from the rea&s;ons above a&s;&s;igned, that an intercour&s;e between two bardeaux would be abortive. Be&s;ides, the&s;e animals proceed from two &s;pecies which are not very fertile, and are <PB N="32" REF="38"> al&s;o under the influence of the &s;ame cau&s;s which often prevent the &s;he-a&s;s from conceiving with her own male. I am more uncertain with re|gard to the &s;terility of <HI>mules</HI> properly &s;o called; becau&s;e they are not liable to the la&s;t cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s; for, as the mare conceives more ea|&s;ily than the &s;he-a&s;s, and the jack-a&s;s is more ar|dent than the hor&s;e, their re&s;pective prolific pow|ers are greater, and their produce not &s;o rare as that of the &s;he-a&s;s and hor&s;e. The mules, of cour&s;e, will be le&s;s barren than the bardeaux. I &s;u&s;pect, however, that two mules never engen|der; and I pre&s;ume, even from the examples of fertile mules, that they owe their impregnation to the a&s;s, rather than to the mule; for we ought not to regard the he-mule as the natural male of the &s;he-mule, though they both have the &s;ame name, or rather, differ only in &s;ex.</P>
<P>To explain this matter, let us &s;uppo&s;e an or|der of kindred in &s;pecies, like that which takes place in families. The hor&s;e and mare will be brother and &s;i&s;ter in &s;pecies, and parents in the fir&s;t degree. It is the &s;ame with the male and female a&s;s. But, if the male a&s;s is given to the mare, they are only coun&s;ins in &s;pecies, or kin|dred in the &s;econd degree. The mule produced by them, participating one half of both &s;pecies, will be removed to the third degree of kindred. Hence the male and female mule, though pro|ceeding from the &s;ame father and mother, in|&s;tead of being brother and &s;i&s;ter in &s;pecies, are <PB N="33" REF="39"> only kindred in the fourth degree; and, of cour&s;e, will produce more difficultly between them&s;elves, than the jack-a&s;s and mare, who are kindred &s;pecies in the &s;econd degree. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the male and female mules will not produce &s;o ea&s;ily between them&s;elves, as with the mare or a&s;s; becau&s;e the kindred of the latter in &s;pecies is only in the third degree, while that of the former is in the fourth degree. The infe|cundity, which appears in the &s;econd degree, &s;hould be more con&s;picuous in the third, and perhaps ab&s;olute in the fourth.</P>
<P>In general, kindred of &s;pecies is one of tho&s;e my&s;teries of Nature, which man can never un|ravel, without a long continued and difficult &s;e|ries of experiments. How can we otherwi&s;e learn, than by the union of different &s;pecies of animals many thou&s;and times repeated, the de|gree of their kindred? Is the a&s;s more allied to the hor&s;e than the zebra? Does the wolf ap|proach nearer to the dog than the fox or jackal? At what di&s;tance from man &s;hall we place the large apes, who re&s;emble him &s;o perfectly in con|formation of body? Are all the &s;pecies of ani|mals the &s;ame now that they were orginally? Has not their number augmented, in&s;tead of be|ing dimini&s;hed? Have not the feeble &s;pecies been de&s;troyed by the &s;tronger, or by the tyran|ny of man, the number of whom has become a thou&s;and times greater than that of any other large animal? What relations can be e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween <PB N="34" REF="40"> kindred &s;pecies, and another kindred &s;till better known, that of different races in the &s;ame &s;pecies? Does not a race, like the mixed &s;pecies, proceed from an anomalous individual, which forms the original &s;tock? In the dog &s;pe|cies, there is, perhaps, a race &s;o rare, that it is more difficult to procreate than the mixed &s;pecies proceeding from the a&s;s and mare. How many que&s;tions does this &s;ubject admit of; and how few of them are we in a condition to re&s;olve? How many facts mu&s;t be di&s;covered before we can even form probable conjectures? However, in&s;tead of being di&s;couraged, the philo&s;opher ought to applaud Nature, even when &s;he is mo&s;t my&s;terious, and to rejoice that, in proportion as he removes one part of her veil, &s;he exhibits an immen&s;ity of other objects, all worthy of his re&s;earches. For, what we already know ought to point out what may &s;till be known. There is no boundary to the human intellect. It ex|tends in proportion as the univer&s;e is di&s;played. Hence man can and ought to attempt every thing: He wants nothing but time to enable him to ob|tain univer&s;al knowledge. By multiplying his ob&s;ervations, he might fore&s;ee all the phaeno|mena and all the events of Nature with equal certainty, as if he deduced them from their im|mediate cau&s;s: And what enthu&s;ia&s;m can be more pardonable, or rather more noble, than to believe that man is capable, by his labours, to <PB N="35" REF="41"> di&s;cover all the powers and my&s;teries of Na|ture!</P>
<P>The&s;e labours con&s;i&s;t chiefly in making ob&s;er|vations and experiments, from which we di&s;co|ver new truths. For example, the union of animals of different &s;pecies, by which alone we can learn their kindred, has never been &s;uffi|ciently tried. The facts we have been able to collect concerning this union, whether volun|tary or forced, are &s;o few, that we are not in a condition to a&s;certain the exi&s;tence of <HI>jumars.</HI> This name was fir&s;t given to mules &s;aid to have proceeded from the bull and mare; but it has likewi&s;e been applied to denote mongrels alledged to have been procreated by the jack-a&s;s and cow. Dr Shaw tells us, that, in the provinces of Tu|nis and Algiers, 'there is a little &s;erviceable bea&s;t of burden, called <HI>Kumrah,</HI> begot betwixt an <HI>a&s;s</HI> and a <HI>cow.</HI> That which I &s;aw at Al|giers
(where it was not looked upon as a rari|ty) was &s;ingle hoofed like the a&s;s, but di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from it in having a &s;leeker &s;kin, with the tail and the head (though without horns) in fa&s;hion of the dam's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shaw's Travels, p. 166.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus we have already two kinds of jumars, the one proceeding from the bull and mare, and the other from the jack-a&s;s and cow. A third is mentioned by Merolle, and is pretended to proceed from the bull and &s;he-a&s;s. <Q>'There was a bea&s;t of burden which proceeds from <PB N="36" REF="42"> the bull and &s;he-a&s;s, and is obtained by cover|ing the a&s;s with a cow's &s;kin, in order to de|ceive the bull<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Merolle au Congo, en 1682.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>But I am equally doubtful concerning the ex|i&s;tence of all the three kinds of jumar; though I pretend not to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of the fact. I have even enumerated &s;ome facts which prove an actual copulation between animals of very different &s;pecies: But their embraces were ineffec|tual. Nothing &s;eems to be more remote from the amiable character of the dog than the brutal manners and in&s;tinct of the hog; and the form of their bodies is as different as their natural di&s;|po&s;itions. I have &s;een, however, two examples of a violent attachment between a dog and a &s;ow. Even during this very &s;ummer 1774, a large &s;paniel di&s;covered a violent pa&s;&s;ion for a &s;ow which was in &s;ea&s;on: They were &s;hut up together for &s;everal days; and all the dome&s;tics were witne&s;&s;es of the mutual ardour of the&s;e two animals. The dog exerted many violent efforts to copulate with the &s;ow; but the di&s;&s;imilarity of their organs prevented their union<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This fact happened in the hou&s;e of M. le Conte de la Feuill&eacute;e, in Burgundy.</NOTE>. The &s;ame thing happened &s;ome years before<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Billy, near Chanceau in Burgundy.</NOTE>. Hence animals, though of very different &s;pecies, may contract a &s;trong affection to each other; for it is certain, that, in the above examples, nothing prevented the union of the dog and &s;ow but the <PB N="37" REF="43"> conformation of their organs. It is not equally certain, however, that, if con&s;ummation had ta|ken place, production would have followed. It often happens, that animals of different &s;pecies &s;pontaneou&s;ly unite. The&s;e voluntary unions ought to be prolific, &s;ince they imply that the natural repugnance, which is the chief ob&s;tacle, is &s;urmounted, and al&s;o a conformity between the organs. No fertility, however, has re&s;ulted from &s;uch commixtures. Of this an example recently pa&s;&s;ed before my own eyes. In 1767, and &s;ome &s;ucceeding years, the miller at my e&s;tate of Buffon kept a mare and a bull in the &s;ame &s;table, who contracted &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for each other, that, as often as the mare came in &s;ea&s;on, the bull covered her three or four times every day. The&s;e embraces were repeated during &s;e|veral years, and gave the ma&s;ter of the animals great hopes of &s;eeing their offspring. Nothing, however, re&s;ulted from them. All the inhabi|tants of the place were witne&s;&s;es to this fact, which proves, that, in our climate at lea&s;t, the bull cannot procreate with the mare, and renders this fir&s;t kind of jumar extremely &s;u&s;picious. I have not equal evidence to oppo&s;e to the &s;econd kind, which Dr Shaw &s;ays proceeds from the jack-a&s;s and cow. I acknowledge, that, though the di&s;|&s;imilarities in &s;tructure appear to be nearly e|qual in both ca&s;es, the po&s;itive te&s;timony of a traveller &s;o well informed as Dr Shaw, &s;eems to give a greater degree of probability to the exi&s;t|ence <PB N="38" REF="44"> of this &s;econd kind of jumar than we have for the fir&s;t. With regard to the third jumar, proceeding from the bull and &s;he-a&s;s, I am per|&s;uaded, notwith&s;tanding the authority of Merolle, that it has no more exi&s;tence than the one &s;up|po&s;ed to be produced by the bull and mare. The nature of the bull is &s;till farther removed from that of the &s;he-a&s;s, than from that of the mare: And the unfertility of the mare and bull, which is a&s;certained by the above examples, &s;hould apply with greater force to the union of the bull and a&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>The NOMENCLATURE of APES.</HEAD>
<P>TO teach children, and to addre&s;s men, are two very different ta&s;ks. Children receive, without examination, and even with avidity, the arbitrary and the real, the true and the fal&s;e, whenever they are pre&s;ented to them under the form of precepts. Men, on the contrary, re|ject with contempt all precepts which are not founded on &s;olid principles. We &s;hall, there|fore, adopt none of tho&s;e methodical di&s;tribu|tions by which, under the appellation of <HI>Ape,</HI> a multitude of animals, belonging to very different &s;pecies, have been huddled together in one in|di&s;criminate ma&s;s.</P>
<P>What I call an <HI>ape</HI> is an animal without a tail, who&s;e face is flat, who&s;e teeth, hands, fingers, and nails re&s;emble tho&s;e of man, and who, like him, walk erect on two feet. This definition, derived from the nature of the animal it&s;elf, and from its relations to man, excludes all animals who have tails; all tho&s;e who have prominent faces or long muzzles; all tho&s;e who have crook|ed or &s;harp claws; and all tho&s;e who walk more willingly on four than on two legs. According to this preci&s;e idea, let us examine how many &s;pecies of animals ought to be ranked under the denomination of <HI>ape.</HI> The antients knew only <PB N="40" REF="46"> one. The <HI>pithecos</HI> of the Greeks, and the <HI>&s;imia</HI> of the Latins, is a true <HI>ape,</HI> and was the &s;ubject upon which Ari&s;totle, Pliny, and Galen in&s;ti|tuted all the phy&s;ical relations they di&s;covered between that animal and man. But this ape, or pigmy of the antients, which &s;o &s;trongly re|&s;embles man in external &s;tructure, and &s;till more &s;trongly in its internal organization, differs from him, however, by a quality, which, though rela|tive in it&s;elf, is not the le&s;s e&s;&s;ential. This qua|lity is magnitude. The &s;tature of man, in ge|neral, exceeds five feet; that of the <HI>pithecus,</HI> or pigmy, never ri&s;es above one fourth of this height. Hence, if this ape had been &s;till more &s;imilar to man, the antients would have been ju|&s;tified for regarding it only as an <HI>homunculus,</HI> an imperfect dwarf, a pigmy, capable of combating with cranes; while man knew how to tame the elephant and conquer the lion.</P>
<P>But, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the &s;outhern re|gions of Africa and India, we have found another ape po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this quality of magnitude; an ape as tall and as &s;trong as man, and equally ardent for women as for its own females; an ape who knows how to bear arms, to attack his enemies with &s;tones, and to defend him&s;elf with clubs. Be&s;ides, he re&s;embles man &s;till more than the pigmy; for, independent of his having no tail, of his flat face, of the re&s;emblance of his arms, hands, toes, and nails to ours, and of his walk|ing con&s;tantly on end, he has a kind of vi&s;age <PB N="41" REF="47"> with features which approach to tho&s;e of the human countenance, a beard on his chin, and no more hair on his body than men have, when in a &s;tate of nature. Hence the inhabitants of his country, the civilized Indians, have not he|&s;itated to a&s;&s;ociate him with the human &s;pecies, under the denomination of <HI>Orang-outang,</HI> or
<HI>wild man</HI>; while the Negroes, almo&s;t equally wild, and as ugly as the&s;e apes, who imagine not that civilization exalts our nature, have gi|ven it the appellation of <HI>Pongo,</HI> which is the name of a bea&s;t, and has no relation to man. This orang-outang or pongo is only a brute, but a brute of a kind &s;o &s;ingular, that man cannot behold it without contemplating him&s;elf, and without being thoroughly convinced that his bo|dy is not the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of his nature.</P>
<P>Thus, we have di&s;covered two animals, the pigmy and the orang-outang, to which the name of <HI>ape</HI> ought to be applied. There is a third, to which, though more deformed both in relation to man and to the ape, this appellation cannot be refu&s;ed. This animal, which till now was unknown, and was brought from the Ea&s;t Indies, under the name of <HI>gibbon,</HI> walks on end, like the other two, and has a flat face. He likewi&s;e wants a tail. But his arms, in&s;tead of being pro|portioned to the height of his body, like tho&s;e of man, the orang-outang, or the pigmy, are &s;o enormou&s;ly long, that, when &s;tanding on his two feet, he touches the ground with his hands, <PB N="42" REF="48"> without bending either his body or limbs. This ape is the third and la&s;t to which the name ought to be applied: In this genus, he con&s;titutes a &s;in|gular or mon&s;trous &s;pecies, like the race of thick-legged men, &s;aid to inhabit the i&s;land of Saint-Thomas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Di&s;&s;ertation on the Varieties of the Human Spe|cies, Vol. III. of this work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the apes, another tribe of animals pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, to which we &s;hall give the ge|neric name of <HI>baboon.</HI> To di&s;tingui&s;h them more accurately from the other kinds, let it be remarked, that the baboon has a &s;hort tail, a long face, a broad high muzzle, canine teeth, proportionally larger than tho&s;e of man, and callo&s;ities on its buttocks. By this definition, we exclude from the baboon tribe all the apes, who have no tail; all the monkeys, who&s;e tails are as long or longer than their bodies; and all tho&s;e who have thin, &s;harp pointed muzzles. The antients had no proper names for the&s;e ani|mals. Ari&s;totle alone &s;eems to have pointed out one of the baboons under the name <HI>&s;imia porca|ria</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The denomination <HI>Simia Porcaria,</HI> which is employed by no other author but Ari&s;totle, was not improperly applied to denote the baboon; for I find in the works of &s;everal travel|lers, who probably never read Ari&s;totle, the muzzle of the ba|boon compared to the &s;nout of a hog. Be&s;ides, the&s;e animals have &s;ome re&s;emblance in the form of their bodies.</NOTE>, though he has given but a very imperfect idea of the animal. The Italians fir&s;t called it
<HI>babuino</HI>; the Germans, <HI>bavion</HI>; the French, <HI>ba|bouin</HI>; <PB N="43" REF="49"> the Briti&s;h, <HI>baboon</HI>; and all the modern writers of Latin, <HI>papio.</HI> We &s;hall call it <HI>baboon,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other &s;pecies which have &s;ince been di&s;covered in the &s;outhern re|gions of Africa and India. We are acquainted with three &s;pecies of the&s;e animals: 1. The <HI>ba|boon</HI> properly &s;o called, which is found in Lybia, Arabia, &amp;c. and is probably the <HI>&s;imia porcaria</HI> of Ari&s;totle. 2. The <HI>mandrill,</HI> or <HI>ribbed-no&s;e,</HI> is &s;till larger than the baboon, has a violet colour|ed face, the no&s;e and cheeks ribbed with deep oblique furrows, and is found in Guinea and in the warme&s;t provinces of Africa. 3. The <HI>ou|anderou,</HI> which is &s;maller than the baboon and mandrill; its body is thinner, its head and face are &s;urrounded with a kind of long bu&s;hy mane, and is found in Ceylon, Malabar, and other &s;outhern regions of India. Thus we have pro|perly defined three &s;pecies of apes, and three &s;pecies of baboons, which are all very different from one another.</P>
<P>But, as Nature knows none of our definitions, as &s;he has not cla&s;&s;ed her productions by bundles or genera, and as her progre&s;s is always gradual and marked by minute &s;hades, &s;ome intermediate animal &s;hould be found between the ape and baboon. This intermediate &s;pecies actually ex|i&s;ts, and is the animal which we call <HI>magot,</HI> or the <HI>Barbary ape.</HI> It occupies a middle &s;tation between our two definitions. It forms the &s;hade between the apes and baboons. It differs from <PB N="44" REF="50"> the fir&s;t by having a long muzzle and large ca|nine teeth; and, from the &s;econd, becau&s;e it ac|tually wants the tail, though it has an appendix of &s;kin, which has the appearance of a very &s;mall tail. Of cour&s;e, it is neither an ape nor a baboon, but, at the &s;ame time, partakes of the nature of both. This animal, which is very common in Higher Egypt, as well as in Barbary, was known to the antients. The Greeks and Romans called it <HI>cynocephalus,</HI> becau&s;e its muz|zle re&s;embled that of a dog. Let us now arrange the&s;e animals in their proper order: The <HI>orang-outang</HI> is the fir&s;t ape; the <HI>pigmy</HI> the &s;econd; and the <HI>gibbon,</HI> though different in figure, the third; the <HI>cynocephalus</HI> or <HI>magot</HI> the fourth ape, or the fir&s;t baboon; the <HI>papio</HI> is the fir&s;t baboon; the <HI>mandrill</HI> the &s;econd; and the <HI>ouanderou,</HI> or little baboon, the third. This order is neither arbitrary nor fictitious, but agreeable to the &s;cale of Nature.</P>
<P>After the apes and baboons, come the <HI>guenons,</HI> or <HI>monkeys</HI>; that is, animals re&s;embling the apes and baboons, but which have tails as long, or longer than their bodies. The word <HI>guenon</HI> has, for &s;ome ages, had two acceptations different from that we have here given it: It is general|ly employed to &s;ignify &s;mall apes, and &s;ometimes to denote the female of the ape. But, more an|tiently, we called <HI>&s;inges,</HI> or <HI>magots,</HI> the apes with|out a tail, and <HI>guenons,</HI> or <HI>mones,</HI> tho&s;e which had long tails. This fact appears from the <PB N="45" REF="51"> works of &s;ome travellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Senegal there are &s;everal &s;pecies of apes, as the <HI>gue|nons,</HI> with a long tail; and the <HI>magots,</HI> who have no tail; <HI>Voyage de le Maire, p.</HI> 101.&mdash;In the mountains of South Ame|rica, there is a kind of <HI>mones,</HI> or long-tailed monkeys, which the &s;avages call <HI>cacuyen.</HI> They are of the &s;ame &s;ize with the common kind, from which they differ only by having a beard on their chin.&mdash;Along with the&s;e <HI>mones,</HI> there are found a number of &s;mall yellow animals, called <HI>&s;agouins</HI>; <HI>Singularit&eacute;s da la Fr. Antarct. par Thevet, p.</HI> 103.</NOTE> in the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth centuries. The word <HI>guenon</HI> is pro|bably derived from <HI>k&eacute;bos,</HI> or <HI>k&eacute;pos,</HI> which the Greeks employed to denote the long-tailed apes. The&s;e <HI>k&eacute;bes,</HI> or <HI>guenons,</HI> are &s;maller and weaker than the apes and baboons. They are ea&s;ily di|&s;tingui&s;hable from one another by this difference, and particularly by their long tail. With equal ea&s;e, they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>makis</HI> or <HI>maucaucos</HI>; becau&s;e they have not a &s;harp muzzle, and in&s;tead of &s;ix cutting teeth, like the makis, they have only four, like the apes and baboons. We know eight &s;pecies of gue|nons; and, to prevent confu&s;ion, we &s;hall be|&s;tow on each a proper name: 1. The <HI>macaque,</HI> or hare-lipped monkey; 2. The <HI>patas,</HI> or red monkey; 3. The <HI>malbrouk</HI>; 4. The <HI>mangabey,</HI> or monkey with the upper eye-lids of a pure white colour; 5. The <HI>mone,</HI> or varied monkey; 6 The <HI>callitrix,</HI> or green monkey: 7. The
<HI>mou&s;tac,</HI> or whi&s;kered monkey; 8. The <HI>talapoin</HI>; 9. The <HI>douc,</HI> or monkey of Cochinchina. The antient Greeks knew only two of the&s;e <HI>guenons,</HI> <PB N="46" REF="52"> or long-tailed monkeys, namely, the mone and the callitrix, who are natives of Arabia and the northern parts of Africa. They had no idea of the other kinds; becau&s;e the&s;e are only found in the &s;outhern provinces of Africa and the Ea&s;t Indies, countries entirely unknown in the days of Ari&s;totle. This great philo&s;opher, and the Greeks in general, were too wi&s;e to confound beings by common, and, therefore, equivocal names. They called the ape without a tail <HI>pi|thecos,</HI> and the monkey with a long tail, <HI>k&eacute;bos.</HI> As they knew the&s;e animals to be di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies, they gave to each a proper name, derived from their mo&s;t &s;triking characters. All the apes and baboons which they knew, namely, the <HI>pigmy,</HI> the <HI>cynocephalus,</HI> or <HI>magot,</HI> and the
<HI>&s;imia porcaria,</HI> or <HI>papio,</HI> have their hair nearly of a uniform colour. But the monkey, which we have called <HI>mone,</HI> and the Greeks <HI>k&eacute;bos,</HI> has hair of different colours, and is generally known by the name of the <HI>varied ape.</HI> This &s;pecies of monkey was mo&s;t common, and be&s;t known in the days of Ari&s;totle; and, from its mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed character, he called it <HI>k&eacute;bos,</HI> which, in Greek, &s;ignifies <HI>varieties in colour.</HI> Thus all the animals belonging to the cla&s;s of apes, baboons, and monkeys, mentioned by Ari&s;totle, are redu|ced to four, the <HI>pithecos,</HI> the <HI>cynocephalos,</HI> the
<HI>&s;imia porcaria,</HI> and the <HI>k&eacute;bos</HI>; which we believe to be the <HI>pigmy,</HI> the <HI>magot,</HI> or Barbary ape, the
<HI>baboon,</HI> and the <HI>mone,</HI> or varied monkey, not <PB N="47" REF="53"> only becau&s;e they agree with the characters gi|ven of them by Ari&s;totle, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e the other &s;pecies mu&s;t have been unknown to the antients, &s;ince they are natives of countries into which the Greek travellers had never penetrated.</P>
<P>Two or three centuries after Ari&s;totle, we find, in the Greek writers, two new names, <HI>cal|lithrix</HI> and <HI>cercopithecos,</HI> both relative to the <HI>gue|nons,</HI> or long-tailed monkeys. In proportion as di&s;coveries were made of the &s;outhern regions of Africa and A&s;ia, we found new animals, and other &s;pecies of monkeys: And, as mo&s;t of the&s;e monkeys had not, like the <HI>k&eacute;bos,</HI> various colours, the Greeks invented the generic name <HI>cercopi|thecos,</HI> or <HI>tailed ape,</HI> to denote all the &s;pecies of monkeys or apes with long tails; and, having re|marked, among the&s;e new &s;pecies, a monkey with hair of a lively greeni&s;h colour, they called it
<HI>callithrix,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>beautiful hair.</HI> This callithrix is found in the &s;outh part of Maurita|nia, and in the neighbourhood of Cape de Verd, and is commonly known by the name of the
<HI>green ape.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the other &s;even &s;pecies of monkeys, mentioned above under the appella|tions of <HI>makaque, patas, malbrouk, mangabey,</HI>
<HI>mou&s;tac, talapoin,</HI> and <HI>douc,</HI> they were unknown to the Greeks and Latins. The makaque is a native of Congo; the patas, of Senegal; the man|gabey, of Madaga&s;car; the malbrouk, of Bengal; the mou&s;tac, of Guinea; the talapoin, of Siam; <PB N="84" REF="54"> and the douc, of Cochinchina. All the&s;e terri|tories were equally unknown to the antients.</P>
<P>As the progre&s;s of Nature is uniform and gra|dual, we find between the baboons and monkeys an intermediate &s;pecies, like that of the magot between the apes and baboons. The animal which fills this interval has a great re&s;emblance to the monkeys, particularly to the makaque; its muzzle, at the &s;ame time, is very broad, and its tail &s;hort, like that of the baboons. Being ignorant of its name, we have called it <HI>maimon,</HI> or <HI>pig-tailed baboon,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the others. It is a native of Sumatra. Of all the monkeys or baboons, it alone has a naked tail; and, for this rea&s;on, &s;everal authors have given it the denomination of the <HI>pig-tailed,</HI> or <HI>rat-tailed ape.</HI></P>
<P>We have now enumerated all the animals of the Old World, to whom the common name of
<HI>ape</HI> has been applied, though they belong not only to different &s;pecies, but to different genera. To augment the confu&s;ion, the &s;ame names of
<HI>ape, cynocephalus, k&eacute;bos,</HI> and <HI>cercopithecos,</HI> which had been invented by the Greeks fifteen centu|ries ago, have been be&s;towed on animals pecu|liar to the New World, though &s;o recently di&s;|covered. They never dreamed that none of the African or Ea&s;t Indian animals had any exi&s;tence in the &s;outhern regions of the New Continent. In America, we have di&s;covered animals with hands and fingers. This &s;imilarity was alone <PB N="49" REF="55"> &s;ufficient to procure to them the name of <HI>apes,</HI> without con&s;idering that, for the transfe|rence of a name, identity of genus, and even of &s;pecies, is nece&s;&s;ary. Now, the&s;e American animals, of which we &s;hall make two cla&s;|&s;es, under the appellations of <HI>&s;apajous,</HI> or mon|keys with prehen&s;ile tails; and <HI>&s;agoins,</HI> or mon|keys with long tails, which are not prehen&s;ile, or want the faculty of laying hold of any ob|ject, are very different from the apes of A&s;ia and Africa; and, in the &s;ame manner, as no apes, ba|boons, or monkeys are to be found in the New World, there are neither &s;apajous nor &s;agoins in the Old. Though we have already given a ge|neral view of the&s;e facts, in our di&s;&s;ertation con|cerning the animals of both Continents, we can now prove them in a more particular manner, and demon&s;trate, that, of &s;eventeen &s;pecies, to which all the animals of the Old World called
<HI>apes,</HI> may be reduced, and, of twelve or thir|teen in the New World, to whom this name has been transferred, none of them are the &s;ame, or to be found equally in both Worlds; for, of the &s;eventeen &s;pecies in the Old Continent, three or four apes mu&s;t fir&s;t be retrenched, who certainly exi&s;t not in America, and to whom the &s;apajous and &s;agoins have no re&s;emblance. In the &s;econd place, three or four baboons mu&s;t likewi&s;e be retrenched: They are larger than the &s;apajous and &s;agoins, and al&s;o very different in figure. There remain only nine monkeys with whom <PB N="50" REF="56"> any compari&s;on can be in&s;tituted. Now, all the&s;e monkeys, as well as the apes and baboons, have general and particular characters, which &s;eparate them entirely from the &s;apajous and &s;a|goins. The fir&s;t of the&s;e characters is to have naked buttocks, and natural callo&s;ities peculiar to the&s;e parts: The &s;econd is to have <HI>abajoues,</HI> or pouches under the cheeks, in which they can keep their victuals. The third is to have a nar|row partition between the no&s;trils, and the a|pertures of the no&s;trils them&s;elves placed in the under part of the no&s;e, like tho&s;e of man. The &s;apajous and &s;agoins have none of the&s;e charac|ters. The partition between their no&s;trils is al|ways very thick; the apertures of their no&s;trils are &s;ituated in the &s;ides of the no&s;e, and not in the under part of it. They have hair on their buttocks, and no callo&s;ities. They have no pouches under the cheeks. Hence they differ from the monkeys not only in &s;pecies, but in genus, &s;ince they po&s;&s;e&s;s none of the general characters which are common to the whole tribe of monkeys. This difference of genus nece&s;&s;a|rily implies greater differences in &s;pecies, and &s;hows that the&s;e animals are very remote from each other.</P>
<P>It is with much impropriety, therefore, that the names <HI>ape</HI> and <HI>monkey</HI> have been applied to the <HI>&s;apajous</HI> and <HI>&s;agoins.</HI> We mu&s;t pre&s;erve their names, and, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;ociating them with the apes, we &s;hould begin by comparing <PB N="51" REF="57"> them with one another. The&s;e two tribes dif|fer from each other by a remarkable character: All the &s;apajous u&s;e their tail as a finger to hang upon branches, or to lay hold of any object they cannot reach with their hand. The &s;agoins, on the contrary, have not the power of employing their tail in this manner. Their face, ears, and hair are al&s;o different: We may, therefore, &s;epa|rate them into two di&s;tinct genera. In giving the hi&s;tory of the &s;pecies, I &s;hall avoid all tho&s;e denominations which can only apply to the apes, baboons, and monkeys, and pre&s;erve the names they receive in their native country.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with &s;ix or &s;even &s;pecies of &s;apajous, and &s;ix of &s;agoins, mo&s;t of which have &s;ome varieties. We have carefully &s;earch|ed all the writings of travellers in order to di&s;|cover the proper name of each &s;pecies; becau&s;e the names they receive in the places they inhabit, generally point out &s;ome peculiar characteri&s;tic, which alone is &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h them from one another.</P>
<P>With regard to the varieties, which, in this cla&s;s of animals, are perhaps more numerous than the &s;pecies, we &s;hall endeavour to refer each of them to their proper kinds. We have had forty of the&s;e animals alive, each of which differed more or le&s;s from one another; and to us it appears that the whole may be reduced to thirty &s;pecies, namely, three apes, and an inter|mediate &s;pecies between them and the baboons; <PB N="52" REF="58"> three baboons, and an intermediate &s;pecies be|tween them and the monkeys; nine monkeys; &s;even &s;apajous; and &s;ix &s;agoins. All the others, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t of them, ought to be regarded as varieties only. But, as we are uncertain whether &s;ome of the&s;e varieties may not be di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies, we &s;hall endeavour to give all of them proper names.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, let us con&s;ider terre&s;trial animals, &s;ome of which have a great re&s;em|blance to man, in a new point of view. The whole have improperly received the general name of <HI>quadrupeds.</HI> If the exceptions were few, we would not have found fault with the application of this name. It was formerly remarked, that our definitions and denomina|tions, however general, never comprehend the whole; that beings always exi&s;t which elude the mo&s;t cautious definitions which ever were in|vented; that intermediate beings are always di&s;|covered; that &s;everal of them, though appa|rently holding a middle &s;tation, e&s;cape from the li&s;t; and that the general names, under which we mean to include them, are incomplete; be|cau&s;e Nature &s;hould only be con&s;idered by uni|ties, and not by aggregates; becau&s;e man has invented general denominations with the &s;ole view of aiding his memory, and &s;upplying the defects of his under&s;tanding; and becau&s;e he afterwards fooli&s;hly con&s;idered the&s;e general names as realities; and, in fine, becau&s;e he has <PB N="53" REF="59"> endeavoured to comprehend under them beings, and even whole cla&s;&s;es of beings, which required different appellations. I can give an example, without departing from the cla&s;s of quadrupeds, which, of all animals, we are be&s;t acquaint|ed with, and, of cour&s;e, were in a condition to have be&s;towed on them the mo&s;t preci&s;e de|nominations.</P>
<P>The name <HI>quadruped</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that the ani|mal has <HI>four feet.</HI> If it wants two feet, like the manati; if it has arms and hands, like the ape; or if it has wings, like the bat, it is not a quadruped. Hence this general term, when applied to the&s;e animals, is abu&s;ed. To obtain preci&s;ion in words, the ideas they pre&s;ent mu&s;t be &s;trictly true. If we had a term for two hands &s;imilar to that which denotes two feet, we might then &s;ay that man was the only biped and <HI>bima|nus,</HI> becau&s;e he alone has two hands and two feet; that the manati is a <HI>bimonus</HI>; that the bat is only a biped; and that the ape is a <HI>quadrima|nus,</HI> or four-handed animal. Let us now apply the&s;e new denominations to all the particular beings to which they belong, and we &s;hall find, that, from about two hundred animals who go under the common name of <HI>quadrupeds,</HI> thirty-five &s;pecies of apes, baboons, monkeys, &s;apajous, &s;agoins, and makis, mu&s;t be retrenched, becau&s;e they are <HI>quadrimani,</HI> or four-handed; and that to the&s;e thirty-five &s;pecies, the loris, or taille&s;s maucauco, the Virginian, murine, and Mexican <PB N="54" REF="60"> opo&s;&s;um, the Egyptian and woolly jerboa's, &amp;c. &s;hould be added, becau&s;e they are four|handed like the apes and monkeys. Thus the li&s;t of four-handed animals being at lea&s;t forty &s;pecies, the real number of quadrupeds is one fifth dimini&s;hed. We mu&s;t likewi&s;e retrench twelve or fifteen &s;pecies of bipeds, namely, the bats, who&s;e fore-feet are rather wings than feet, and likewi&s;e three or four jerboa's, becau&s;e they can walk on their hind feet only, the fore-feet being too &s;hort. If we &s;ubtract al&s;o the manati, which has no hind feet, the arctic and Indian walrus, and the &s;eals, to whom the hind feet are u&s;ele&s;s; and, if we &s;till retrench tho&s;e animals which u&s;e their fore-feet like hands, as the bears, the marmots, the coati's the a|gouti's, the &s;quirrels, the rats, and many others, the denomination of <HI>quadruped</HI> will appear to be applied improperly to more than one half of the&s;e animals. The whole and cloven-hoof|ed are indeed the only real quadrupeds. When we de&s;cend to the digitated cla&s;s, we find four-handed, or ambiguous quadrupeds, who u&s;e their fore-feet as hands, and ought to be &s;epa|rated or di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others. Of whole-hoofed animals, there are three &s;pecies, the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, and the zebra. If to the&s;e we add the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippo|potamus, and the camel, who&s;e feet, though terminated by nails, are &s;olid, and &s;erve the a|nimals for walking only, we &s;hall have &s;even <PB N="55" REF="61"> &s;pecies to which the name of <HI>quadruped</HI> is per|fectly applicable. The number of cloven-hoof|ed animals greatly exceeds that of the whole|hoofed. The oxen, the &s;heep, the goats, the antilopes, the bubalus, the lama, the pacos, the the giraffe, the elk, the rain-deer, the &s;tag, the fallow-deer, the roebuck, &amp;c. are all cloven|footed, and con&s;titute about forty &s;pecies. Thus we have already fifty animals, ten whole and forty cloven-hoofed, to whom the name <HI>qua|druped</HI> is properly applied. In the digitated animals, the lion, tiger, panther, leopard, lynx, cat, wolf, dog, fox, hyaena, badger, polecat, wea&s;els, ferret, porcupines, hedgehogs, arma|dillos, ant-eaters, and hogs, which la&s;t con&s;ti|tute the &s;hade between the digitated and cloven|footed tribes, form a number con&s;i&s;ting of more than forty &s;pecies, to which the term of <HI>qua|druped</HI> applies with perfect preci&s;ion; becau&s;e, though their fore-feet be divided into four or five toes, they are never u&s;ed as hands. But all the other digitated &s;pecies, who u&s;e their fore-feet in carrying food to their mouths, are not, in &s;trict propriety of language, quadrupeds. The&s;e &s;pecies, which likewi&s;e amount to forty, make an intermediate cla&s;s between quadru|peds and four-handed animals, being neither the one nor the other. Hence, to more than a fourth of our animals, the name of <HI>quadruped</HI> does not apply: and, to more than a half of them, the application of it is incomplete.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62"> The four-handed animals fill the interval be|tween man and the animals; and the two-hand|ed &s;pecies con&s;titute a mean term in the di&s;tance between man and the cetaceous tribes. The bipeds with wings form the &s;hade between qua|drupeds and birds; and the digitated &s;pecies, who u&s;e their fore-feet as hands, fill the whole &s;pace between the quadrupeds and the four|handed kinds. But I will pur&s;ue this &s;ub|ject no farther: However u&s;eful it may be for acquiring a di&s;tinct knowledge of animals, it is &s;till more &s;o by affording a fre&s;h proof, that all our definitions or general terms want pre|ci&s;ion, when applied to the objects or beings which they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But why are the&s;e definitions and general terms, which appear to be the mo&s;t brilliant exer|tions of the human intellect, &s;o defective in their application? Does the error nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the narrow limits of our under&s;tanding? Or, rather, does it not proceed &s;olely from our in|capacity of combining and perceiving at one time a great number of objects? Let us com|pare the works of Nature with tho&s;e of man. Let us examine how both operate, and inquire whether the mind, however acute, can follow the &s;ame route, without loo&s;ing it&s;elf in the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, in the ob&s;curity of time, or in the infinity of related beings. When man directs his mind to any object, if his per|ceptions be accurate, he takes the &s;traight line, <PB N="57" REF="63"> runs over the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, and employs the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible time in accompli&s;hing his end. What an expence of thought, how many com|binations are nece&s;&s;ary to avoid tho&s;e deceitful and fallacious roads which at fir&s;t pre&s;ent them|&s;elves in &s;uch numbers, that the choice of the right path requires the nice&s;t di&s;crnment? This path, however, is not beyond the reach of the human intellect, which can proceed without deviating from the &s;traight line. The mind is enabled to arrive at a point by means of a line; and, if another point mu&s;t be gained, it can only be attained by another line. The train of our ideas is a delicate thread, which extends in length, without any other dimen&s;ions. Nature, on the contrary, never moves a &s;tep which extends not on all &s;ides, and runs at once through the three dimen&s;ions of length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. While man reaches but one point, Nature accompli&s;hes a &s;olid, by penetrating the whole parts which com|po&s;e a ma&s;s. In be&s;towing form on brute matter, our &s;tatuaries, by the union of art and time, are enabled to make a &s;urface which exactly repre&s;ents the out&s;ide of an object. Every point of this &s;ur|face requires a thou&s;and combinations. Their genius is directly exerted upon as many lines as there are &s;trokes in the figure. The &s;malle&s;t deviation would be a deformity. This marble, &s;o perfect that it &s;eems to breathe, is, of cour&s;e, only a multitude of points at which the arti&s;t arrives by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of labour; becau&s;e human genius, being unable to &s;eize more than <PB N="58" REF="64"> one dimen&s;ion at the &s;ame time, and our &s;en&s;es reaching no farther than &s;urfaces, we cannot pe|netrate matter: But Nature, in a moment, puts every particle in motion. She produces forms by exertions almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous. She at once developes them in all their dimen&s;ions. As &s;oon as her movements reach the &s;urface, the penetra|ting forces with which &s;he is animated operate internally. The &s;malle&s;t atom, when &s;he choo&s;es to employ it, is in&s;tantly compelled to obey. Hence &s;he acts, at the &s;ame time, on all &s;ides, before, behind, above, below, on the right and left; and, con&s;equently, &s;he embraces not only the &s;urface, but every particle of the ma&s;s. How different likewi&s;e is the product? What compari|&s;on is there between a &s;tatue and an organized bo|dy? How unequal, at the &s;ame time, are the pow|ers, how di&s;proportioned the in&s;truments? Man can employ only the power he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Limited to a &s;mall quantity of motion, which he can only communicate by the mode of impul&s;ion, his exer|tions are confined to &s;urfaces; becau&s;e, in general, the impul&s;ive force is only tran&s;mitted by &s;uper|ficial contact. He neither &s;ees nor touches more than the &s;urfaces of bodies; and, when he wi&s;hes to attain a more intimate knowledge, though he opens and divides, &s;till he &s;ees and touches no|thing more than their &s;urfaces. To penetrate the interior parts of bodies, he would require a por|tion of that force which acts upon the ma&s;s, or, of gravity, which is Nature's chief in&s;trument. If man could employ this penetrating force as <PB N="59" REF="65"> he does that of impul&s;ion, or if he had a &s;en&s;e relative to it, he would be enabled to perceive the e&s;&s;ence of matter, and to arrange &s;mall por|tions of it, in the &s;ame manner as Nature ope|rates at large. It is owing to the want of in&s;tru|ments, therefore, that human art cannot ap|proach that of Nature. His figures, his pictures, his de&s;igns, are only &s;urfaces, or imitations of &s;urfaces; becau&s;e the images he receives by his &s;en&s;es are all &s;uperficial, and he has no mode of giving them a body.</P>
<P>What is true with regard to the arts, applies likewi&s;e to the &s;ciences. The latter, however, are not &s;o much limited; becau&s;e the mind is their chief in&s;trument, and becau&s;e, in the for|mer, it is &s;ubordinate to the &s;en&s;es. But, in the &s;ciences, the mind commands the &s;en&s;es as often as it is employed in thinking and not in opera|ting, in comparing and not in imitating. Now, the mind, though bound up by the &s;en&s;es, though often deceived by their fallacious reports, is nei|ther dimini&s;hed in its purity nor activity. Man, who naturally loves knowledge, commenced by rectifying and demon&s;trating the errors of the &s;en&s;es. He has treated them as mechanical in&s;tru|ments, the effects of which mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the te&s;t of experiment. Proceeding thus with the balance in one hand, and the compa&s;s in the other, he has mea&s;ured both time and &s;pace. He has cogni&s;ed the whole out&s;ide of Nature; and, be|ing unable to penetrate her internal parts by his <PB N="60" REF="66"> &s;en&s;es, his deductions concerning them have been drawn from compari&s;on and analogy. He di&s;|covered that there exi&s;ts in matter a general force, different from that of impul&s;ion, a force which falls not under the cogni&s;ance of our &s;en&s;es, and which, though we are incapable of u&s;ing it, Nature employs as her univer&s;al agent. He has demon&s;trated, that this force belongs equally to all matter, in proportion to its ma&s;s or real quan|tity; and that its action extends to immen&s;e di&s;tances, decrea&s;ing as the &s;paces augment. Then, turning his views upon living beings, he perceived that heat was another force nece&s;&s;ary to their production; that light was a matter en|dowed with infinite ela&s;ticity and activity; that the formation and expan&s;ion of organized bo|dies were effects of a combination of all the&s;e forces; that the exten&s;ion and growth of ani|mals and vegetables follow the laws of the at|tractive force, and are effected by an augmenta|tion in the three dimen&s;ions at the &s;ame time; and that a mould, when once formed, mu&s;t, by the&s;e laws of affinity, produce a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of o|ther moulds perfectly &s;imilar to the original. By combining the&s;e attributes, common to the animal and vegetable, he recogni&s;ed, that there exi&s;ted in both an inexhau&s;tible, circulating &s;tore of organic &s;ub&s;tance; a &s;ub&s;tance equally real as brute matter; a &s;ub&s;tance which continues al|ways in a live as the other does in a dead &s;tate; a &s;ub&s;tance univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, which pa&s;&s;es from <PB N="61" REF="67"> vegetables to animals by means of nutrition, re|turns from animals to vegetables by the proce&s;s of putrefaction, and maintains a perpetual circu|lation for the animation of beings. He percei|ved, that the&s;e active organic particles exi&s;ted in all organized bodies; that they were combined, in &s;maller or greater quantities, with dead mat|ter; that they were more abundant in animals, in whom every thing is alive, and more rare in vegetables, in which death predominates, and life &s;eems to be extinct, organization being &s;urcharged with brute matter; and that plants are, of cour&s;e, deprived of progre&s;&s;ive motion, of heat, and of life, exhibiting no other quality of animation but expan&s;ion and reproduction. Reflecting on the manner in which the&s;e la&s;t are accompli&s;hed, he di&s;covered that every living being is a mould that has the power of a&s;&s;imilating the &s;ub&s;tances with which it is nouri&s;hed; that growth is an effect of this a&s;&s;imilation; that the development of a living body is not a &s;imple augmentation of volume, but an exten&s;ion in all dimen&s;ions, a penetration of new matter through all parts of the ma&s;s; that the&s;e parts, by increa&s;ing propor|tionally to the whole, and the whole proportion|ally to the parts, the form is pre&s;erved and con|tinues always the &s;ame, till growth is completed; that, when the body has acquired its full expan|&s;ion, the &s;ame matter, formerly employed in augmenting its volume, is returned, as &s;uperflu|ous, from all the parts to which it had been a&s;|&s;imilated, <PB N="62" REF="68"> and, by uniting in a common point, forms a new being perfectly &s;imilar to the fir&s;t, and, to attain the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, requires only to be developed by the &s;ame mode of nutrition. He perceived that man, quadrupeds, cetaceous ani|mals, birds, reptiles, in&s;ects, trees, and herbs, were nouri&s;hed, expanded, and reproduced by the &s;ame law; and that the mode of their nutrition and generation, though depending on the &s;ame gene|ral cau&s;e, appeared to be very different, becau&s;e it could not operate but in a manner relative to the form of each particular &s;pecies of being. Proceeding gradually in this inve&s;tigation, he be|gan, after a &s;uce&s;&s;ion of ages, to compare ob|jects. To di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other, he gave them particular names; and, to unite them under one point of view, he invented general terms. Taking his own body as the phy&s;ical model of all animated beings, he mea&s;ured, exa|mined, and compared all their parts, and he di&s;|covered that the form of every animal that breathes is nearly the &s;ame; that, by di&s;&s;ecting an ape we may learn the anatomy of a man; that, taking another animal, we always find the &s;ame fund of organization, the &s;ame &s;en&s;es, the &s;ame vi&s;cera, the &s;ames bones, the &s;ame fle&s;h, the &s;ame motion of the fluids, the &s;ame play and ac|tion of the &s;olids. In all of them he found a heart, veins, and arteries, and the &s;ame organs, circulation, re&s;piration, dige&s;tion, nutrition, and &s;ecretion; in all of them, he found a &s;olid &s;truc|ture <PB N="63" REF="69"> compo&s;ed of the &s;ame pieces, and nearly &s;ituated in the &s;ame manner. This plan pro|ceeds uniformly from man to the ape, from the ape to quadrupeds, from quadrupeds to cetaceous animals, to birds, to fi&s;hes, and to reptiles: This plan, I &s;ay, when well apprehended by the hu|man intellect, exhibits a faithful picture of ani|mated Nature, and affords the mo&s;t general as well as the mo&s;t &s;imple view under which &s;he can be con&s;idered: And, when we want to ex|tend it, and to pa&s;s from the animal to the ve|getable, we perceive this plan, which had at fir&s;t varied only by &s;hades, gradually degenerating from reptiles to in&s;ects, from in&s;ects to worms, from worms to zoophytes, from zoophytes to plants; and, though changed in all its external parts, &s;till pre&s;erving the &s;ame character, the principal features of which are nutrition, growth, and reproduction. The&s;e features are common to all organized &s;ub&s;tances. They are eternal and divine; and, in&s;tead of being effaced by time, it only renews and renders them more con|&s;picuous.</P>
<P>If, from this grand picture of re&s;emblances ex|hibited in animated Nature, as con&s;tituting but one family, we pa&s;s to that of the differences, where each &s;pecies claims a &s;eparate apartment, and a di&s;tinct portrait, we &s;hall find, that, with the exception of a few large kinds, &s;uch as the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the tiger, and the lion, which ought to have parti|cular <PB N="64" REF="70"> frames, all the others &s;eem to unite with their neighbours, and to form groups of degra|ded &s;imilarities, or genera, repre&s;ented by our nomeclators in a net-work of figures, &s;ome of which are &s;upported by the feet, others by the teeth, by the hair, and others by relations &s;till more minute: And, even the apes, who&s;e form &s;eems to be mo&s;t perfect, or approaches neare&s;t to that of man, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in a group, and require the utmo&s;t attention to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from each other; becau&s;e the privilege of &s;eparate &s;pecies depends le&s;s on figure than magnitude; and man him&s;elf, though a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, and infinitely removed from that of all other animals, being only of a middle &s;ize, has a greater number of neighbouring &s;pecies than the very large kinds. In the hi&s;tory of the orang-outang, we &s;hall find, that, if figure alone be regarded, we might con&s;ider this animal as the fir&s;t of apes, or the mo&s;t imperfect of men; becau&s;e, except the intellect, the orang-outang wants nothing that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and, in his body, differs le&s;s from man that from the other ani|mals which receive the denomination of <HI>apes.</HI></P>
<P>Hence mind, reflection, and language depend not on figure, or on the organization of the bo|dy. The&s;e are endowments peculiar to man. The orang-outang, though he neither thinks nor &s;peaks, has a body, members, &s;en&s;es, a brain, and a tongue perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of man: He counterfiets every human movement; but <PB N="65" REF="71"> her performs no action that is characteri&s;tic of man. This imperfection is perhaps owing to want of education, or to an error in our judg|ment. You compare, it may be &s;aid, an ape in the woods with a man in poli&s;hed &s;ociety. But, in order to form a proper judgment of them, a &s;avage man and an ape &s;hould be viewed toge|ther; for we have no ju&s;t idea of man in a pure &s;tate of nature. The head covered with bri&s;tly hair, or with curled wool; the face veiled with a long beard; two cre&s;cents of hairs &s;till gro&s;|&s;er, by their length and prominency contract the front, and not only ob&s;cure the eyes, but &s;ink and round them like tho&s;e of the brutes; the lips thick and protruded; the no&s;e flat; the a&s;pect wild and &s;tupid; the ears, the body, and the members covered with hair; the brea&s;ts of the female long and flabby, and the &s;kin of her belly hanging down as far as her knees; the children wallowing in filth, and crawling on their hands and feet; the father and mother &s;itting &s;quat on their hams, both hideous, and be&s;meared with corrupted grea&s;e. This &s;ketch, drawn from a &s;avage Hottentot, is a flattering portrait; for the di&s;tance between man in a pure &s;tate of na|ture and a Hottentot, is greater than between a Hottentot and us. But, if we want to compare the ape to man, we mu&s;t add the relations of or|ganization, the conformities of temperament, the vehement appetite of the males for the females, the &s;ame &s;tructure of genitals in both &s;exes, the <PB N="66" REF="72"> periodic cour&s;es of the female, the voluntary or forced intermixture of the Negre&s;&s;es with the apes, the produce of which has entred into both &s;pecies; and then con&s;ider, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they are not the &s;ame, how difficult it is to perceive the interval by which they are &s;epa|rated.</P>
<P>If our judgment were limited to figure alone, I acknowledge that the ape might be regarded as a variety of the human &s;pecies. The Creator has not formed man's body on a model ab&s;o|lutely different from that of the mere animal. He has comprehended the figure of man, as well as that of all other animals, under one general plan. But, at the &s;ame time that he has given him a material form &s;imilar to that of the ape, he has penetrated this animal body with a di|vine &s;pirit. If he had conferred the &s;ame privi|lege, not on the ape, but on the meane&s;t, and what appears to us to be the wor&s;t con&s;tructed animal, this &s;pecies would &s;oon have become the rival of man; it would have excelled all the o|ther animals by thinking and &s;peaking. What|ever re&s;emblance, therefore, takes place between the Hottentot and the ape, the interval which &s;eparates them is immen&s;e; becau&s;e the former is endowed with the faculties of thought and of &s;peech.</P>
<P>Who will ever be able to a&s;certain how the organization of an idiot differs from that of ano|ther man? Yet the defect is certainly in the ma|terial <PB N="67" REF="73"> organs, &s;ince the idiot is likewi&s;e endowed with a &s;oul. Now, as between one man and another, where the whole &s;tructure is perfectly &s;imilar, a difference &s;o &s;mall that it cannot be perceived is &s;ufficient to prevent thought, we &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed that it never appears in the ape, who is deprived of the nece&s;&s;ary prin|ciple.</P>
<P>The &s;oul, in general, has a proper action to|tally independent of matter. But, as its divine Author has been plea&s;ed to unite it to the body, the exerci&s;e of its particular acts depends on the &s;tate of the material organs. This dependence is apparent, not only from the ca&s;e of idiots, but from people affected with delirium, from &s;leep, from new born infants, who cannot think, and from very old men, whom the power of think|ing has for&s;aken. It is even probable, that the chief effect of education con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in in&s;tructing the mind, or maturing its operations, as in modifying the material organs, and bring|ing them into the mo&s;t favourable &s;tate for the exerci&s;e of the &s;entient principle. Now, there are two kinds of education, which ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e their effects are extremely different; the education of the indi|vidual, which is common to man and the other animals; and the education of the &s;pecies, which appertains to man alone. A young animal, both from natural encitements and from example, learns, in a few weeks, to do every thing its pa|rents <PB N="68" REF="74"> can perform. To an infant, &s;everal years are nece&s;&s;ary before it acquires this degree of perfection; becau&s;e, when brought forth, it is incomparably le&s;s advanced, weaker, and more imperfectly formed, than the &s;maller animals. In early infancy, the mind is nothing, when com|pared to the powers it will afterwards acquire. In receiving individual education, therefore, the infant is much &s;lower than the brute; but, for this very rea&s;on, it becomes &s;u&s;ceptible of that of the &s;pecies. The multiplicity of &s;uccours, the continual cares, which this &s;tate of imbecillity for a long time requires, cheri&s;h and augment the attachment of the parents. In training the body, they cultivate the mind. The time employed in &s;trengthening the former gives an advantage to the latter. The bodily powers of mo&s;t ani|mals are more advanced in two months than tho&s;e of the infant in two years. Hence the time employed in be&s;towing on the infant its in|dividual education is as twelve to one, without e&s;timating the fruits of what follows after this period, without con&s;idering that animals &s;epa|rate from their parents as &s;oon as they can pro|vide for them&s;elves, and that, not long after this &s;eparation, they know each other no more. All education cea&s;es the moment that the aid of the parents become unnece&s;&s;ary. This time of edu|cation being &s;o &s;hort, its effects mu&s;t be very li|mited: It is even a&s;toni&s;hing that the animals acquire, in two months, all that is nece&s;&s;ary for <PB N="69" REF="75"> them during the re&s;t of life: If we &s;uppo&s;e that a child, in an equal period, were &s;trong enough to quit his parents, and never return to them, would there be any perceptible difference be|tween this infant and a brute? However inge|nious the parents, they would not have time &s;uf|ficient to modify and prepare his organs, or to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;malle&s;t communication of thought between their minds and his. They could not excite his memory by impre&s;&s;ions frequently e|nough reiterated. They could not even mollify or unfold the organs of &s;peech. Before a child can pronounce a &s;ingle word, his ears mu&s;t be &s;truck many thou&s;and times with the &s;ame &s;ound; and, before he can make a proper application of it, the &s;ame combination of the word and the object to which it relates, mu&s;t be many thou|&s;and times pre&s;ented to him. Education, there|fore, which alone can develope the powers of the mind, mu&s;t be uninterruptedly continued for a long time. If &s;topt, not at two months, as in the animals, but even at the age of one year, the mind of the infant, having received no in&s;truc|tion, would remain inactive like that of the idiot, the defect of who&s;e organs prevents the recep|tion of knowledge. This rea&s;oning would ac|quire redoubled &s;trength, if the infant were born in a pure &s;tate of nature, if it were confined to the &s;ole tutorage of a Hottentot mother, and were enabled by its bodily powers to &s;eparate from her at the age of two months, would it not <PB N="70" REF="76"> &s;ink below the condition of the idiot, and, with regard to its material part, be entirely levelled with the brutes? But in this condition of nature, the fir&s;t education requires an equal time as in the civilized &s;tate; for in both, the infant is e|qually feeble, and equally &s;low in its growth; and, con&s;equently, demands the care of its pa|rents during an equal period. In a word, if abandoned before the age of three years, it would infallibly peri&s;h. Now, this nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o long continued intercour&s;e between the mother and child, is &s;ufficient to communicate to it all that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es: And though we &s;hould fal&s;ely &s;up|po&s;e, that a mother, in a &s;tate of nature, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es nothing, not even the faculty of &s;peech, would not this long intercour&s;e with her infant produce a language? Hence a &s;tate of pure nature, in which man is &s;uppo&s;ed neither to think nor &s;peak, is imaginary, and never had an exi&s;tence. This nece&s;&s;ity of a long intercour&s;e between pa|rents and children produces &s;ociety in the mid&s;t of a de&s;ert. The family under&s;tand each other both by &s;igns and &s;ounds; and this fir&s;t ray of intelligence, when cheri&s;hed, cultivated, and com|municated, unfolds, in proce&s;s of time, all the germs of cogitation. As this habitual intercour&s;e could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;o long, without producing mu|tual &s;igns and &s;ounds, the&s;e &s;igns and &s;ounds, always repeated and gradually engraven on the memory of the child, would become permanent expre&s;&s;ions. The catalogue of words, though <PB N="71" REF="77"> &s;hort, forms a language which will &s;oon extend as the family augments, and will always follow, in its improvement, the progre&s;s of &s;ociety. As &s;oon as &s;ociety begins to be formed, the educa|tion of the infant is no longer individual, &s;ince the parents communicate to it not only what they derive from Nature, but likewi&s;e what they have received from their progenitors, and from the &s;ociety to which they belong. It is no long|er a communication between detached indivi|duals, which, as in the animals, would be limited to the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of &s;imple faculties, but an in|&s;titution of which the whole &s;pecies participate, and who&s;e produce con&s;titutes the ba&s;is and bond of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Even among brute animals, though deprived of the &s;entient principle, tho&s;e who&s;e education is longe&s;t appear to have mo&s;t intelligence. The elephant, which takes the longe&s;t time in acqui|ring its full growth, and requires the &s;uccour of its mother during the whole fir&s;t year of its ex|i&s;tence, is al&s;o the mo&s;t intelligent of all animals. The Guiney-pig, which is full grown, and ca|pable of generating at the age of three weeks, is for this rea&s;on alone, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t &s;tupid &s;pecies. With regard to the ape, who&s;e nature we are endeavouring to a&s;certain, how|ever &s;imilar to man, he is &s;o &s;trongly marked with the features of brutality, that it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from the moment of his birth. He is then proportionally &s;tronger and better formed <PB N="72" REF="78"> than the infant: He grows fa&s;ter: The &s;upport of his mother is only nece&s;&s;ary for a few months: His education is purely individual, and con&s;e|quently as limited as that of the other animals.</P>
<P>Hence the ape, notwith&s;tanding his re&s;em|blance to man, is a brute, and, in&s;tead of ap|proaching our &s;pecies, holds not the fir&s;t rank among the animals; becau&s;e he is by no means the mo&s;t intelligent. The relation of corporeal re&s;emblance alone has given ri&s;e to the prejudice in favour of the great faculties of the ape. He re&s;embles man, it has been &s;aid, both externally and internally; and, therefore, he mu&s;t not only imitate us, but do every thing which we perform. We have &s;een, that all the actions which ought to be denominated <HI>human,</HI> are relative to &s;ociety; that they depend, at fir&s;t, on the mind, and af|terwards on education, the phy&s;ical principle of which is the long intercour&s;e that nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the parents and children; that, in the ape, this intercour&s;e is very &s;hort; that, like the other animals, he receives only an indi|vidual education; and that he is not &s;u&s;ceptible of that of the &s;pecies. Of cour&s;e, he can per|form no human actions, &s;ince no action of the ape has the &s;ame principle, or the &s;ame de&s;ign. With regard to imitation, which appears to be the mo&s;t &s;triking character of the ape-kind, and which the vulgar have attributed to him as a pe|culiar talent, before we decide, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inquire whether this imitation be &s;pontaneous or forced. Does the ape imitate us from inclina|tion, <PB N="73" REF="79"> or becau&s;e, without any exertion of the will, he feels the capacity of doing it? I appeal to all tho&s;e who have examined this animal with|out prejudice, and I am convinced that they will agree with me, that there is nothing voluntary in this imitation. The ape, having arms and hands, u&s;es them as we do, but without thinking of us. The &s;imilarity of his members and or|gans nece&s;&s;arily produces movements, and &s;ome|times &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of movements, which re&s;emble ours. Being endowed with the human &s;truc|ture, the ape mu&s;t move like man. But the &s;ame motions imply not that he acts from imi|tation. Two bodies which receive the &s;ame im|pul&s;e, two &s;imilar pendulums or machines, will move in the &s;ame manner. But the&s;e bodies or machines can never be &s;aid to intimate each other in their motions. The ape and the human body are two machines &s;imilarly con&s;tructed, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily move nearly in the &s;ame manner. But parity is not imitation. The one depends on matter and the other on mind. Imitation pre|&s;uppo&s;es the de&s;ign of imitating. The ape is in|capable of forming this de&s;ign, which requires a train of thinking; and, con&s;equently, man, if he inclines, can imitate the ape; but the ape can|not even incline to imitate man.</P>
<P>This parity is only the phy&s;ical part of imi|tation, and by no means &s;o complete as the &s;i|militude, from which, however, it proceeds as an immediate effect. The ape has a greater re&s;em|blance <PB N="74" REF="80"> to us in his body and members, than in the u&s;e he makes of them. By ob&s;erving him attentively, we ea&s;ily perceive, that all his move|ments are bri&s;k, intermittent, and precipitous; and that, in order to compare them with tho&s;e of man, we mu&s;t adopt another &s;cale, or rather a different model. All the actions of the ape are derived from his education, which is purely a|nimal. To us they appear ridiculous, incon&s;e|quent, and extravagant; becau&s;e, by referring them to our own, we a&s;&s;ume a fal&s;e &s;cale, and a deceitful mode of mea&s;uring. As his nature is vivacious, his temperament warm, his di&s;po&s;i|tions petulant, and none of his affections have been &s;oftened or re&s;trained by education, all his habitudes are exce&s;&s;ive, and re&s;emble more the movements of a maniac than the actions of a man, or even of a peaceable animal. It is for this rea&s;on that we find him indocile, and that he receives with difficulty the impre&s;&s;ions we wi&s;h to make on him. He is in&s;en&s;ible to care&s;|&s;es, and is rendered obedient by cha&s;ti&s;ement alone. He may be kept in captivity, but not in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. Always melancholy, &s;tub|born, repugnant, or making grimaces, he may be &s;aid to be rather conquered than tamed. The &s;pecies, of cour&s;e, have never been rendered do|me&s;tic in any part of the world, and, con&s;e|quently, is farther removed from man than mo&s;t other animals: For docility implies &s;ome analo|gy between the giver and the receiver of in|&s;truction. <PB N="75" REF="81"> It is a relative quality, which cannot be exerted but when there is a certain number of common faculties on both &s;ides, that differ only between them&s;elves, becau&s;e they are ac|tive in the ma&s;ter, and pa&s;&s;ive in the &s;cholar. Now, the pa&s;&s;ive qualities of the ape have le&s;s relation to the active qualities of man than tho&s;e of the dog or elephant, who require no more than good treatment to communicate to them the delicate and gentle &s;en&s;ations of faithful at|tachment, voluntary obedience, grateful &s;ervice, and unre&s;erved devotion.</P>
<P>In relative qualities, therefore, the ape is far|ther removed from the human race than mo&s;t other animals. His temperament is al&s;o very different. Man can inhabit every climate. He lives and multiplies in the northern as well as the &s;outhern regions of the earth. But the ape exi&s;ts with difficulty in temperate countries, and can multiply only in tho&s;e which are warm. This difference of temperament implies others in organization, which, though concealed, are not the le&s;s real: It mu&s;t likewi&s;e have a great influence on his natural di&s;po&s;itions. The ex|ce&s;s of heat, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;titu|tion and vigour of this animal, renders all his qualities and affections inordinate. No other cau&s;e is requi&s;ite to account for his petulance, his &s;alaciou&s;ne&s;s, and his other pa&s;&s;ions, which appear to be equally violent and di&s;orderly.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="82"> Thus the ape, which philo&s;ophers, as well as the vulgar, have regarded as a being difficult to define, and who&s;e nature was at lea&s;t equivocal, and intermediate between that of man and the animals, is, in fact, nothing but a real brute, en|dowed with the external mark of humanity, but deprived of thought, and of every faculty which properly con&s;titutes the human &s;pecies; a brute inferior to many others in his relative powers, and &s;till more e&s;&s;entially different from the hu|man race by his nature, his temperament, and the time nece&s;&s;ary to his education, ge&s;tation, growth, and duration of life; that is, by all the real habitudes which con&s;titute what is called
<HI>Nature</HI> in a particular being.</P>

But this orang|outang of Linnaeus and Bontius would not be the true kind, which is larger than the talle&s;t man.

The people of the country, when they travel in the woods, make fires where they &s;leep in the night; and in the morning, when they are gone, the Pongoes will come and &s;it about the &s;ire, till it goeth out; for they have no under&s;tanding to lay the wood together. They go many together, and kill many Negroes that travail in the woods. Ma|ny times they fall upon the elephants, which come to feed where they be, and &s;o beat them with their clubbed fi&s;ts, and pieces of wood, <PB N="83" REF="89"> that they will run roaring away from them. Tho&s;e Pongoes are never taken alive, becau&s;e they are &s;o &s;trong, that ten men cannot hold one of them; but yet they take many of their young ones with poi&s;oned arrows. The young Pongo hangeth on his mother's belly, with his hands fa&s;t cla&s;ped about her; &s;o that, when the country people kill any of the females, they take the young one, which hangeth fa&s;t upon his mother.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas's Pilgrimes, part 2. p. 982.</NOTE>.' It is from this explicit pa&s;&s;age that I have derived the names <HI>pongo</HI> and <HI>jocko.</HI> Battel farther remarks, that, when one of the&s;e animals dies, the others cover his body with branches and leaves of trees. Pur|chas adds in a note, that, in the conver&s;ations he had with Battel, he learned that a pongo car|ried off a young Negro from him, who lived a whole year in the &s;ociety of the&s;e animals; that, on his return, the Negro &s;aid, that they had ne|ver injured him; that they were generally as tall as a man, but much thicker; and that they were nearly double the volume of an ordinary man. Job&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, that, in places frequent|ed by the&s;e animals, he &s;aw a kind of habitations compo&s;ed of interlaced branches of trees, which would at lea&s;t protect them from the &s;corching rays of the &s;un<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, tom. 3. p. 295.</NOTE>.

They are capable of being taught almo&s;t every thing we choo&s;e.' Gauthier Schoutten remarks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Gaut. Schoutten.</NOTE>, 'that the apes called <HI>orang-outangs</HI> by the Indians are nearly of the &s;ame figure and &s;ize with men, only their back and reins are covered with hair, though there is no hair on the fore part of their bodies; that the females have two large brea&s;ts; that their vi&s;age is coar&s;e, their no&s;e flat, and even &s;unk, and their ears like tho&s;e of men; that they are robu&s;t and active; that they defend them&s;elves again&s;t armed men; that they are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of women, who cannot pa&s;s through the woods, without being &s;uddenly attacked and ravi&s;hed by the&s;e apes.' Dampier, Froger, and other travellers, a&s;&s;ure us, that the orang-outangs carry off girls of eight or ten years of age to the tops of trees, and that it is extremely difficult to re&s;cue them. To the&s;e te&s;timonies we may add that of M. de la Bro&s;&s;e, who a&s;&s;ures us, in his voyage to Angola in the year 1738, that the orang-outangs, which he calls <HI>quimpez&eacute;s,</HI> 'endeavour to &s;urpri&s;e the Ne|gre&s;&s;es, <PB N="85" REF="91"> whom they detain for the purpo&s;e of enjoying them, and entertain them plentiful|ly. I knew a Negre&s;s at Loango who remain|ed three years with the&s;e animals. They grow from &s;ix to &s;even feet high. They erect huts, and u&s;e bludgeons in their own defence. They have flat faces, broad flat no&s;es, flat ears, &s;kins clearer than tho&s;e of Molattoes, long thinly &s;cattered hairs in &s;everal parts of their bodies, bellies extremely ten&s;e, and flat heels rai&s;ed behind about half an inch. They walk upon two or four feet, at plea&s;ure. We purcha&s;ed two young ones, a male of fourteen months of age, and a female of twelve,' &amp;c.</P>
<P>We have thus enumerated the mo&s;t certain facts we could collect concerning the great <HI>orang|outang</HI> or <HI>pongo</HI>; and, as magnitude is the chief character by which it differs from the jocko, I per&s;i&s;t in thinking that they are of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies: For, two circum&s;tances are at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible: 1. The jocko may be a permanent variety, a race much &s;maller than that of the pongo. In fact, they both inhabit the &s;ame climate; they live in the &s;ame manner; and, of cour&s;e, ought to re|&s;emble each other in every article, &s;ince they both receive equally the influences of the &s;ame &s;oil and &s;ky. In the human &s;pecies, have we not an example of a &s;imilar variety? The Laplander and Fin, though they live under the &s;ame climate, differ nearly as much in &s;tature, <PB N="86" REF="92"> and much more in other qualities, than the jocko differs from the great orang-outang. 2. The jocko, or &s;mall orang-outang, which we have &s;een alive, as well as tho&s;e of Tulpius, Ty&s;on, and others which have been brought to Europe, were all, perhaps, young animals, who had ac|quired only a part of their growth. The one I &s;aw was about two feet and a half high; and the Sieur Nonfoux, to whom it belonged, a&s;&s;u|red me that it exceeded not two years of age. On the &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore, that its growth were proportional to that of man, it might, if it had lived, arrived at the height of more than five feet. The orang-outang of Ty&s;on was &s;till younger; for it was only about two feet high, and its teeth were not perfectly formed. Tho&s;e of Tulpius and Edwards were nearly of the &s;ame &s;tature with the one I &s;aw. Hence it is probable, that the&s;e young animals, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberty in their own climate, would have acquired with age the &s;ame height and di|men&s;ions which travellers have a&s;cribed to the great orang-outang. Of cour&s;e, till better infor|mation be received, we mu&s;t regard the&s;e two animals as con&s;tituting but one &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The orang-outang which I &s;aw, walked al|ways on two feet, even when carrying things of con&s;iderable weight. His air was melancho|ly, his gate grave, his movements mea&s;ured, his di&s;po&s;itions gentle, and very different from tho&s;e of other apes. He had neither the impatience <PB N="87" REF="93"> of the Barbary ape, the maliciou&s;ne&s;s of the ba|boon, nor the extravagance of the monkeys. It may be alledged, that he had the benefit of in|&s;truction; but the other apes, which I &s;hall com|pare with him, were educated in the &s;ame man|ner. Signs and words were alone &s;ufficient to make our orang-outang act: But the baboon required a cudgel, and the other apes a whip; for none of them would obey without blows. I have &s;een this animal pre&s;ent his hand to conduct the people who came to vi&s;it him, and walk as gravely along with them as if he had formed a part of the company. I have &s;een him &s;it down at table, unfold his towel, wipe his lips, u&s;e a &s;poon or a fork to carry the victuals to his mouth, pour his liquor into a gla&s;s, and make it touch that of the per&s;on who drank along with him. When in|vited to take tea, he brought a cup and &s;aucer, placed them on the table, put in &s;ugar, poured out the tea, and allowed it to cool before he drank it. All the&s;e actions he performed, with|out any other in&s;tigation than the &s;igns or ver|bal orders of his ma&s;ter, and often of his own accord. He did no injury to any per&s;on: He even approached company with circum&s;pection, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf as if he wanted to be ca|re&s;&s;ed. He was very fond of dainties, which every body gave him: And, as his brea&s;t was di&s;ea&s;ed, and he was afflicted with a teazing cough, this quantity of &s;weetmeats undoubtedly contributed to &s;horten his life. He lived one <PB N="88" REF="94"> &s;ummer in Paris, and died in London the follow|ing winter. He eat almo&s;t every thing; but preferred ripe and dried fruits to all other kinds of food. He drank a little wine; but &s;ponta|neou&s;ly left it for milk, tea, or other mild li|quors.

<P><PB N="90" REF="96"> Henry Gro&s;s informs us, vol. 1. pag. 233. 
<Q><P>That &s;ome places towards the hills are covered with immen&s;e impenetrable fore&s;ts, that afford a &s;helter for wild bea&s;ts of all &s;orts. But in that which forms the inland boundary of the Carnatic Rajah's dominions, there is one &s;in|gular &s;pecies of creatures, of which I had heard much in India, and of the truth of which the following fact, that happened &s;ome time before my arrival there, may &s;erve for an atte&s;tation.</P>
<P>Vancajee, a merchant of that country, and an inhabitant on the &s;ea coa&s;t, &s;ent up to Bom|bay to the then governour of it, Mr Horne, a couple of tho&s;e creatures before mentioned, as a pre&s;ent, by a coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el, of which one Captain Boag was the ma&s;ter, and the make of which, according to his de&s;cription, and that of others, was as follows.</P>
<P>They were &s;carcely two feet high, walked erect, and had perfectly an human form. They were of a &s;allow white, without any hair, ex|cept in tho&s;e parts that it is cu&s;tomary for man|kind to have it. By their melancholy, they &s;eemed to have a rational &s;en&s;e of their capti|vity, and had many of the human actions. They made their bed very orderly in the cage in which they were &s;ent up, and on being view|ed, would endeavour to conceal, with their hands, tho&s;e parts that mode&s;ty forbids mani|fe&s;ting. The joints of their knees were not re-entering, like tho&s;e of monkeys, but &s;aliant, <PB N="91" REF="97"> like tho&s;e of men; a circum&s;tance they have
(if I mi&s;take not), in common with the orang|outangs in the ea&s;tern parts of India, in Su|matra, Java, and the Spice-i&s;lands, of which the&s;e &s;eem to be the diminutives, though with nearer approaches of re&s;emblance to the human &s;pecies. But, though the navigation from the Carnatic coa&s;t to Bombay is of a very &s;hort run, of not above &s;ix or &s;even degrees, whether the &s;ea air did not agree with them, or that they could not brook their confinement, or that Captain Boag had not properly con&s;ulted their provi&s;ion, the female &s;ickening fir&s;t, died; and the male giving all the demon&s;trations of grief, &s;eemed to take it to heart &s;o, that he refu&s;ed to eat, and, in two days after, followed her. The Captain, on his return to Bombay, report|ing this to the governour, was by him a&s;ked, What he had done with the bodies? He &s;aid he had flung them over board. Being further a&s;ked, why he did not keep them in &s;pirits? He replied bluntly, that he did not think of it. Upon this, the governour wrote afre&s;h to Van|cajee, and de&s;ired him to procure another couple, at any rate, as he &s;hould grudge no expence to be ma&s;ter of &s;uch a curio&s;ity. Van|cajee's an&s;wer was, he &s;hould very willingly oblige him, but that he was afraid it would not be in his power: That the&s;e creatures came from a fore&s;t about &s;eventy leagues up the country, where the inhabitants would &s;ometimes <PB N="92" REF="98"> catch them on the &s;kirts of it; but that they were &s;o exqui&s;itely cunning and fly, that this &s;carcely happened once in a century.</P></Q></P>
<P>Francis Pyrard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Fran&ccedil;ois Pyrard, tom. 2. p. 331.</NOTE> relates, 
<Q>'That, in the pro|vince of Sierra Leona, there is a &s;pecies of a|nimals called <HI>baris,</HI> who are &s;trong and well limbed, and &s;o indu&s;trious, that, when proper|ly trained and fed, they work like &s;ervants; that they generally walk on the two hind feet; that they pound any &s;ub&s;tances in a mortar; that they go to bring water from the river in &s;mall pitchers, which they carry full on their heads. But, when they arrive at the door, if the pitchers are not &s;oon taken off, they allow them to fall; and, when they perceive the pit|cher overturned and broken, they weep and lament.</Q>
Father Jarric, quoted by Nierem|berg
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Euf. Nieremberg. Hi&s;t. Nat. peregrin. lib. 9. cap. 45.</NOTE>, &s;ays the &s;ame thing, nearly in the &s;ame terms. With regard to the education of the&s;e animals, the te&s;timony of Schoutten<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Guat. Schoutten aux Indes Orientales.</NOTE> accords with that of Pyrard. 

<Q><P>'They are taken,' he re|marks, 'with &s;nares, taught to walk on their hind feet, and to u&s;e their fore feet as hands in performing different operations, as rin&s;ing gla&s;&s;es, carrying drink round the company, turning a &s;pit,' &amp;c. 'I &s;aw, at Java,' &s;ays Guat<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Fr. le Guat. tom. 2. p. 96.</NOTE>, 'a very extraordinary ape. It was a female. She <PB N="93" REF="99"> was very tall, and often walked erect on her hind feet. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;he concealed with her hands the parts which di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ex. Except the eye-brows, there was no hair on her face, which pretty much re&s;embled the grote&s;que female faces I &s;aw among the Hotten|tots at the Cape. She made her bed very neat|ly every day, lay upon her &s;ide, and covered her&s;elf with the bed-clothes. . . . When her head ached, &s;he bound it up with a handker|chief; and it was amu&s;ing to &s;ee her thus hooded in bed. I could relate many other little articles which appeared to be extremely &s;ingular. But I admired them not &s;o much as the multitude; becau&s;e, as I knew the de&s;ign of bringing her to Europe to be exhibited as a &s;hew, I was inclined to think that &s;he had been taught many of the&s;e monkey-tricks, which the people con&s;idered as being natural to the animal. She died in our &s;hip, about the lati|tude of the Cape of Good Hope. The figure of this ape had a very great re&s;emblance to that of man,' &amp;c. Gemelli Carreri tells us, that he &s;aw one of the&s;e apes, which cried like an in|fant, walked upon its hind feet, and carried a matt under its arm to lie down and &s;leep upon. The&s;e apes, he adds, appear, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to have more &s;agacity than men: For, when the fruits on the mountains are exhau&s;ted, they come down to the &s;ea coa&s;ts, where they feed <PB N="94" REF="100"> upon carbs, oy&s;ters, and other &s;hell-fi&s;hes. There is a &s;pecies of oy&s;ter called <HI>taclovo,</HI> which weighs &s;everal pounds, and commonly lies open on the &s;hore. The ape, when he wants to eat one of them, being afraid left it &s;hould clo&s;e on his paw, puts a &s;tone into the &s;hell, which prevents it from &s;hutting, and then eats the oy&s;ter at his ea&s;e.</P>
<P>'The apes along the banks of the river Gam|bia,' &s;ays Froger, 'are larger and more mi&s;|chieveous than in any part of Africa: The Ne|groes dread them, and cannot travel alone in the country, without running the hazard of being attacked by the&s;e animals, who often pre&s;ent them with a &s;tick, and force them to fight. I have heard the Portugue&s;e &s;ay, that they have often &s;een them hoi&s;t up young girls, a|bout &s;even or eight years old, into trees, and that they could not be wre&s;ted from them without a great deal of difficulty. The mo&s;t part of the Negroes imagine them to be a fo|reign nation come to inhabit their country, and that they do not &s;peak for fear of being compelled to work.'</P>
<P>'We might di&s;pen&s;e,' another traveller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. hi&s;torique du royaume de Macacar, p. 51.</NOTE> re|marks, 'with &s;eeing a number of apes at Ma|cacar; becau&s;e a rencounter with them is often fatal.

<P>The&s;e are nearly all the facts, concerning this animal, which have been related by voyagers who are lea&s;t credulous, and de&s;erve mo&s;t credit. I have quoted the pa&s;&s;ages entire, becau&s;e every article is important in the hi&s;tory of a brute which has &s;o great a re&s;emblance to man. And, that we may be enabled to a&s;certain the nature of this animal with the greater preci&s;ion, we &s;hall now mark the differences and conformities which make him approach or recede from the human &s;pe|cies. He differs from man externally by the flat|ne&s;s of his no&s;e, by the &s;hortne&s;s of his front, and by his chin, which is not elevated at the ba&s;e. His ears are proportionally too large, his eyes too near each other, and the di&s;tance between his no&s;e and mouth is too great. The&s;e are the only differences between the face of an orang-outang and that of a man. With regard to the body and members, the thighs are proportional|ly too &s;hort, the arms too long, the fingers too &s;mall, the palm of the hands too long and nar|row, and the feet rather re&s;emble hands than the human foot. The male organs of generation differ not from tho&s;e of man, except that the prepuce has no <HI>fraenum.</HI> The female organs are extremely &s;imilar to tho&s;e of a woman.</P>
<P>The orang-outang differs internally from the human &s;pecies in the number of ribs: Man has only twelve; but the orang-outang has <PB N="96" REF="102"> thirteen. The vertebrae of the neck are al&s;o &s;horter, the bones of the pelvis narrow, the but|tocks flatter, and the orbits of the eyes &s;unk deeper. He has no &s;pinal proce&s;s on the fir&s;t vertebra of the neck. The kidneys are round|er than tho&s;e of man, and the ureters have a different figure, as well as the bladder and gall-bladder, which are narrower and longer than in the human &s;pecies. All the other parts of the body, head, and members, both external and in|ternal, &s;o perfectly re&s;emble tho&s;e of man, that we cannot make the compari&s;on without being a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch a &s;imilarity in &s;tructure and organization &s;hould not produce the &s;ame ef|fects. The tongue, and all the organs of &s;peech, for example, are the &s;ame as in man; and yet the orang-outang enjoys not the faculty of &s;peaking; the brain has the &s;ame figure and proportions; and yet he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the power of thinking. Can there be a more evident proof than is exhibited in the orang-outang, that matter alone, though perfectly organized, can produce neither language nor thought, unle&s;s it be animated by a &s;uperior principle? Man and the orang-outang are the only animals who have buttocks and calfs of the legs, and who, of cour&s;e, are formed for walking erect; the only animals who have a broad che&s;t, flat &s;houlders, and vertebrae of the &s;ame &s;tructure; and the only animals who&s;e brain, heart, lungs, liver, &s;pleen, &s;tomach, and inte&s;tines are perfectly &s;i|milar, <PB N="97" REF="103"> and who have an appendix vermiformis or blind-gut. In fine, the orang-outang has a greater re&s;emblance to man than even to the baboons or monkeys, not only in all the parts we have mentioned, but in the largene&s;s of the face, the figure of the cranium, of the jaws, of the teeth, and of the other bones of the head and face; in the thickne&s;s of the fingers and thumb, the figure of the nails, and the number of vertebrae; and, la&s;tly, in the con|formity of the articulations, the magnitude and figure of the rotula, &s;ternum, &amp;c. Hence, as there is a greater &s;imilarity between this ani|mal and man, than between tho&s;e creatures which re&s;emble him mo&s;t, as the Barbary ape, the baboon, and monkey, who have all been de&s;igned by the general name of <HI>apes,</HI> the In|dians are to be excu&s;ed for a&s;&s;ociating him with the human &s;pecies, under the denomination of
<HI>orang-outang,</HI> or <HI>wild man.</HI> As &s;ome of the facts we have related may appear &s;u&s;picious to tho&s;e who never &s;aw this animal, we &s;hall &s;up|port them by the authority of two celebrated anatomi&s;ts. Ty&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The orang-outang has a greater re&s;emblance to man than to the apes or monkeys; becau&s;e, 1. The hairs on his &s;houl|ders are directed downward, and tho&s;e of the arms upward. 2. His face is broader and flatter than that of the apes. 3. The figure of his ear has a greater re&s;emblance to that of man, except the cartilaginous part, which is thin, as in the apes. 4. His fingers are proportionally thicker than tho&s;e of the apes. 5. He is in every article formed for walking erect, which is by no means the ca&s;e with the apes and monkeys. 6. He has thicker buttocks than all the other apes. 7. He has calfs to his legs. 8.

His caecum has a vermicular appendix as in man; but this appendix is wanting in all the other apes: Be&s;ides, the neck of the colon is not &s;o long as that of the apes. 15. The in&s;ertions of the biliary and pancreatic ducts have but one com|mon orifice in man and the orang-outang; but, in the mon|keys, the&s;e in&s;ertions are two inches a&s;under. 16. The colon is longer than that of the apes. 17. The liver is not divided into lobes, as in the apes, but entire, as in man. 18. The bi|liary ve&s;&s;els are the &s;ame as in man. 19. The &s;pleen, and, 20. the pancreas, are the &s;ame. 21. The number of lobes in the lungs is the &s;ame. 22. The pericardium is attached to the diaphragm, as in man. 23. The cone of the heart is blunter than in the apes. 24. He has no pouches at the bottom of the cheeks, as the other apes and monkeys have. 25. His brain is larger than that of the apes, and exactly formed like the human brain. 26. The cranium is rounder, and double the &s;ize of that of the monkeys. 27. All the &s;u|tures of the cranium are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of man; and the bones called <HI>o&s;&s;a triquetra Wormiana</HI> are found in the lambdoid future, which is not the ca&s;e in the other apes or monkeys. 28. He has the <HI>os cribriforme</HI> and the <HI>cri&s;ta galli,</HI> which are wanting in the monkeys. 29. He has the <HI>&s;ella equina</HI> exactly as in man; but, in the apes and monkeys, this part is more elevated and prominent. 30. The proce&s;&s;us pteregoideus is the &s;ame as in man; but it is wanting in the apes and mon|keys. 31. The temporal bones, and tho&s;e called <HI>o&s;&s;a breg|matis,</HI> are the &s;ame as in man; but, in the apes and monkeys, the&s;e bones are of a different form. 32. The os zygomati|cus is &s;mall; but it is large in the apes and monkeys. 33. The teeth, and particularly the dog-teeth and grinders, are more &s;imilar to the human teeth than to tho&s;e of the apes. 34. The tran&s;ver&s;e proce&s;&s;es of the vertebrae of the neck, and the &s;ixth and &s;eventh vertebrae, have a greater re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of man than to tho&s;e of the apes and monkeys. 35. The verte|brae of the neck are not perforated, as in the apes, for the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of nerves, but plain and entire, as in man. 36. The vertebrae of the back and their proce&s;&s;es are the &s;ame as in man; and, in the lower vertebrae, there are only two inferior proce&s;&s;es; but, in the apes, there are four. 37. As in man, there are only five lumbar vertebrae; but, in the monkeys, there are &s;ix or &s;even. 38. The &s;pinal proce&s;&s;es of the lumbar vertebrae are &s;traight, as in man. 39. The <HI>os &s;acrum</HI> is compo&s;ed of five vertebrae, as in man; but, in the apes and monkeys, it con&s;i&s;ts only of three. 40. The coccix is compo&s;ed of four bones, as in man, and the&s;e bones are not perforated; but, in the apes and monkeys, the coccix is compo&s;ed of a greater number of bones, which are all perfo|rated. 41. In the orang-outang, there are only &s;even true ribs (<HI>co&s;tae verae,</HI>) and the extremities of the fal&s;e ribs (<HI>co&s;tae nothae</HI>) are cartilaginous, and articulated with the bodies of the vertebrae; but, in the apes and monkeys, there are eight true ribs, and the extremities of the fal&s;e ribs are o&s;&s;eous, and their articulations are placed in the inter&s;tices between the vertebrae. 42. The &s;ternum of the orang-outang is as broad as that of man, and not narrow, as in the monkeys. 43. The bones of the four fingers are thicker than tho&s;e of the apes. 44. The thigh bone is perfectly &s;imilar to that of man. 45. The rotula is round, and not long, &s;ingle, and not double, as it is in the apes. 46. The heel, the <HI>tar&s;us,</HI> and <HI>metatar&s;us,</HI> are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of man. 47. The middle toe is not &s;o long as in the apes. 48. The <HI>obliquus in&s;erior capitis, pyrifor|mis,</HI> and <HI>biceps femoris</HI> mu&s;cles, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of man; but they are different in the apes and monkeys, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The orang-outang differs from the human &s;pecies more than from the apes or monkeys in the following articles. 1. The thumb is proportionally &s;maller than that of man; but it is larger than that of the other apes. 2. The palm of the hand is longer and narrower than in man. 3. He dif|fers from man and approaches the apes by the length of his toes. 4. He differs from man by having the large toe of the foot removed nearly to the di&s;tance of an inch from the next one, and he &s;hould be rather con&s;idered as a four-hand|ed animal than a quadruped. 5. His thighs are &s;horter than tho&s;e of man; and, 6. his arms are longer. 7. The te&s;ticles are not pendulous. 8. The epiploon is larger than in man. 9. The gall-bladder is longer and narrower. 10. The kid|neys are rounder than in man; and the ureters are al&s;o dif|ferent. 11. The bladder is longer. 12. He has no <HI>fraenum</HI> to the prepuce. 13. The bone in the orbit of the eye is &s;unk deeper. 14. He wants the two cavities below the <HI>&s;ella turcica.</HI> 15. The ma&s;toid and &s;tyloid proce&s;&s;es are extremely &s;mall. 16. The bones of the no&s;e are flat. 17. The <HI>vertebrae</HI> of the neck are &s;hort, as in the apes, flat before and not round, and their &s;pinal proce&s;&s;es are not forked, as in man. 18. He has no &s;pinal proce&s;s in the fir&s;t <HI>vertebra</HI> of the neck. 19. He has thirteen ribs on each &s;ide, and man has only twelve. 20. The <HI>o&s;&s;a illa</HI> are perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the apes, being longer, narrower, and le&s;s concave than in man. 21. The fol|lowing mu&s;cles are found in man, and are wanting in the orang-outang, <HI>Occipitales, frontales, dilatatores alarum na&s;i, &s;eu elevatores labii &s;uperioris, inter&s;pinales colli, glutaei minimi, exten|&s;or digitorum pedis brevis, et tran&s;ver&s;alis pedis.</HI> 22. The mu&s;cles which appear not in the orang-outang, and are &s;ometimes found in man, are tho&s;e called <HI>pyramidales, caro mu&s;culo&s;a qua|drata,</HI> the long tendon and fle&s;hy body of the <HI>palmaris,</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> auriculam.</HI> 23. The orang-outang, has the <HI>elevator</HI> mu&s;cles of the clavicles like tho&s;e of the apes, and different from tho&s;e of man. 24. The following are the mu&s;cles by which the orang-outang re&s;embles the apes, and differs from man: <HI>Longus colli, pectoralis, lati&s;&s;imus dor&s;i, glutaeus maximus et medius, p&s;oas magnus et parvus, iliacus inter nus, et ga&s;trocnemius internus.</HI> 25. He differs from man in the fi|gure of the <HI>deltoides, pronator radii teres, et exten&s;or pollicis brevis.</HI> Anatomy of the orang-outang by Ty&s;on.</P></NOTE> and Cowper di&s;&s;ected him <PB N="98" REF="104"> with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, and have gi|ven us the re&s;ults of the compari&s;ons they made <PB N="99" REF="105"> between the different parts of his body with that of man.

<HI>cynocephalus</HI> or Barbary ape. I &s;hould like|wi&s;e remark, that this author gives &s;ome re&s;em|blances and differences which are not &s;ufficiently accurate.</P>
<P N="1">1. Ty&s;on makes it peculiar to man and the o|rang-outang, to have the hair on the &s;houlders directed downward, and that of the arms up|ward. The hair of mo&s;t animals, it is true, is directed backward or downward; but there are &s;ome exceptions. The &s;loth, and the lea&s;t ant-eater have the hair of their anterior parts directed backward, and that of the crupper and reins di|rected <PB N="102" REF="108"> forward. Hence this character is of no great moment in the compari&s;on of the orang-outang with man.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the pa&s;&s;age quoted from Ty&s;on, I took no notice of the four fir&s;t differences; becau&s;e they are either too &s;light, or ill founded. The fir&s;t is the difference of &s;tature, which is an un|certain and gratuitous character, e&s;pecially as the author acknowledges that his animal was very young. The &s;econd, third, and fourth are derived from the form of the no&s;e, the quan|tity of hair, and other minute relations. I re|trenched &s;everal other differences; for example, the twenty-fir&s;t, drawn from the number of teeth. It is certain that both the human &s;pe|cies and this animal have an equal number of teeth. If the latter had only twenty-eight, as our author remarks, it was owing to his youth; and, it is well known, that man, when young, has not a greater number.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;eventh difference is al&s;o very equivo|cal: The te&s;ticles of children are &s;ituated very high; and this animal, being young, ought not to have had them pendulous.</P>
<P N="4">4. The forty-eight mark of re&s;emblance, and the twenty-fir&s;t, twenty-&s;econd, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth marks of dif|ference, are derived from the figure or pre&s;ence of certain mu&s;cles, which, as they vary in mo&s;t individuals of the human &s;pecies, ought not to be regarded as e&s;&s;ential characters.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="103" REF="109"> 5. All the re&s;emblances and differences drawn from parts too minute, as the proce&s;&s;es of the vertebrae, or derived from the po&s;ition and mag|nitude of certain parts, &s;hould only be con&s;ider|ed as acce&s;&s;ory characters; &s;o that the whole detail of Ty&s;on's table may be reduced to the re&s;emblances and differences we have pointed out.</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;hall mention &s;ome characters of a more general nature, &s;ome of which have been omit|ted by Ty&s;on, and others imperfectly related. 1. Of all the apes, baboons, and monkeys, the orang-outang alone wants tho&s;e pouches with|in the cheeks, into which they put their food, before they &s;wallow it; for the in&s;ide of his mouth is the &s;ame as in man. 2. The gibbon, the Barbary ape, all the baboons, and all the monkeys, except the douc, have flat buttocks, with callo&s;ities on them. The orang-outang alone has plump buttocks without callo&s;ities. The douc likewi&s;e has no callo&s;ities; but his buttocks are flat and covered with hair; &s;o that, in this re&s;pect, the douc forms the &s;hade be|tween the orang-outang and the monkeys. 3. The orang-outang alone has calfs of the legs and fle&s;hy buttocks. This &s;ingle character &s;hows that he is be&s;t formed for walking erect; only his toes are very long, and his heel re&s;ts with more difficulty on the ground than that of man. He runs with more ea&s;e than he walks; and, to enable him to walk ea&s;ily and long, he would <PB N="104" REF="110"> require artificial heels higher than tho&s;e of our &s;hoes. 4. Though the orang-outang has thir|teen ribs, and man but twelve. This difference does not make him approach nearer to the ba|boons or monkeys than it removes him from man; becau&s;e the number of ribs varies in mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;pecies, &s;ome of them having twelve, others eleven, others ten, &amp;c. Hence the only differences between the body of this animal and that of man are reduced to two, namely, the figure of the bones of the pelvis, and the con|formation of the feet. The&s;e are the only parts worthy of con&s;ideration, by which the orang-outang has a greater re&s;emblance to the other apes than he has to man.</P>
<P>From this expi&s;cation, which I have made with all the exactne&s;s I was capable of, a judg|ment may be formed concerning the orang-outang. If there were a &s;cale by which we could de&s;cend from human nature to that of the brutes, and if the e&s;&s;ence of this nature con&s;i&s;ted entirely in the form of the body, and depended on its organization, the orang-outang would approach nearer to man than any other animal. Placed in the &s;econd rank of beings, he would make the other animals feel his &s;uperiority, and oblige them to obey him. If the principle of imitation, by which he &s;eems to mimic human actions, were a re&s;ult of thought, this ape would be &s;till farther removed from the brutes, and have a greater affinity to man. But, as we for|merly <PB REF="111" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate CCLII. JOCKO.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="105" REF="112"> remarked, the interval which &s;eparates them is immen&s;e; and the re&s;emblance in figure and organization, and the movements of imita|tion which &s;eem to re&s;ult from the&s;e &s;imilarities, neither make him approach the nature of man, nor elevate him above that of the brutes.</P>

<P>The orang-outang has no pouches within his cheeks, no tail, and no callo&s;ities on his but|tocks; which la&s;t are plump and fle&s;hy. All his teeth are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of man. His face is flat, naked, and tawny. His ears, hands, feet, brea&s;t, and belly, are likewi&s;e naked. The hair of his head de&s;cends on both temples in the form of tre&s;&s;es. He has hair on his back and loins, but in &s;mall quantities. He is five or &s;ix feet high, and walks always erect on his two feet.

<P>ARISTOTLE remarks, 'that there are animals who&s;e nature is ambiguous, and are partly allied to man, and partly to qua|drupeds; &s;uch as the <HI>pigmies,</HI> the <HI>kebes,</HI> and the <HI>cynocephali.</HI> The <HI>kebe</HI> is a pigmy with a tail; and the <HI>cynocephalus</HI> is perfectly &s;imilar to the pigmy, except that it is larger and &s;tronger, and has a longer muzzle, approach|ing nearly to that of the bull-dog, from which circum&s;tance its name has been derived. Its manners are likewi&s;e more ferocious, and its <PB N="107" REF="114"> teeth are &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the pigmy, and have a greater re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the dog.' From this pa&s;&s;age, it is apparent, that neither the pigmy nor the <HI>cynocephalus</HI> men|tioned by Ari&s;totle have a tail; for he &s;ays, that the pigmies with tails are called <HI>kebes,</HI> and that the <HI>cynocephalus</HI> re&s;embles the pigmy in every article, except the muzzle and teeth. Hence Ari&s;totle takes notice of two apes without tails, the pigmy and <HI>cynocephalus,</HI> and other apes with tails, to which he gives the denomination of
<HI>kebes.</HI> Now, to compare our own knowledge with that of Ari&s;totle, we &s;hall remark, that we have &s;een three &s;pecies of apes without tails, the orang-outang, the gibbon, or long armed ape, and the magot, or Barbary ape, and that the pigmy is none of the&s;e three &s;pecies; for the orang-outang and gibbon could not be known to Ari&s;totle, &s;ince the&s;e animals are only found in the &s;outhern parts of Africa and India, which were not di&s;covered in his time; be&s;ides, they have characters very different from tho&s;e he a|&s;cribes to the pigmy. But the third &s;pecies, which we call the <HI>magot,</HI> or Barbary ape, is the
<HI>cynocephalus</HI> of Ari&s;totle; for it has no tail; its muzzle re&s;embles that of a bull-dog; and its canine teeth are long and thick. Be&s;ides, this animal is common in A&s;ia Minor, and other ea&s;t|ern provinces which were known to the Greeks. The pigmy belongs to the &s;ame country; but we know it only from the relations of travel|lers. <PB N="108" REF="115"> But, though we have never been able to procure this ape, its exi&s;tence is equally real with that of the <HI>cynocephalus.</HI> Ge&s;ner and John|&s;ton have given figures of the pigmy.

<P>We remarked, that the orang-outang, the pig|my, the gibbon, and the Barbary ape, are the only animals to which the generic name <HI>ape</HI> ought to be applied; becau&s;e they alone want the tail, and walk &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and oftener on two feet than on four. The orang-outang and the gibbon are very different from the pigmy and Barbary ape. But, as the two latter have a perfect re&s;emblance, except in the length of the muzzle and the largene&s;s of the canine teeth, the one has frequently been mi&s;taken for the o|ther. They have always been mentioned under <PB N="109" REF="116"> the common appellation of <HI>ape,</HI> even in lan|guages which have one name for apes without tails, and another for tho&s;e which have tails. In German, both the pigmy and Barbary ape are called <HI>aff,</HI> and <HI>ape</HI> in Engli&s;h. It is only in the Greek language that each of the&s;e animals has a proper name. <HI>Cynocephalus</HI> is rather an adjec|tive than a proper &s;ub&s;tantive; and for that rea|&s;on we have not adopted it.</P>
<P>From the te&s;timony of the antients, it appears, that the pigmy is more mild and docile than all the other apes with which they were acquaint|ed, and that it was common in A&s;ia as well as in Lybia, and other provinces of Africa which were frequented by the Greek and Roman tra|vellers. Hence I pre&s;ume that the following pa&s;&s;ages of Leo Africanus and Marmol ought to be applied to the pigmy. They tell us, that the apes with long tails, which are &s;hown in Mau|ritania, and which the Africans call <HI>mones,</HI> come from the Negro country; but that the apes with|out tails are natives, and very numerous in the mountains of Mauritania, Bugia, and Con&s;tan|tina: 'They have,' &s;ays Marmol, 'the feet, the hands, and the countenance of a man, and are extremely malicious and full of &s;pirit. They live upon herbs, corn, and all kinds of fruits. They go in troops into the gardens or fields; but, before they leave the thickets, one of them a&s;cends an eminence, from which he views the country; and, when he &s;ees no per&s;on, he <PB N="110" REF="117"> gives the &s;ignal, by a cry for the re&s;t to pro|ceed, and removes not from his &s;tation as long as they continue abroad. But, whenever he perceives any per&s;on approaching, he &s;creams with a loud voice; and, by leaping from tree to tree, they all fly to the mountains. Their flight is worthy of admiration; for the females, though they carry four or five young ones on their backs, make great &s;prings from branch to branch. Though extremely cunning, va&s;t numbers of them are taken by different arts. When wild, they bite de&s;perately; but by car|re&s;&s;es they are ea&s;ily tamed. They do much mi&s;chief to the fruits and corn; for they gather it together in heaps, cut it, and throw it on the ground, whether it be ripe or not, and de|&s;troy more than they eat or carry off. Tho&s;e who are tamed perform things which are al|mo&s;t incredible, and imitate every human ac|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 57.</NOTE>.' Kolbe relates nearly the &s;ame facts with regard to the apes of the Cape of Good Hope. But, from his figure and de&s;cription, it is obvious, that the&s;e apes are baboons, and have a &s;hort tail, a long muzzle, pointed nails, &amp;c.; and that they are much larger and &s;tronger than the apes of Mauritania<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See below, Art. <HI>Baboon.</HI></NOTE>. We may, therefore, pre&s;ume, that Kolbe has copied the pa&s;&s;age from Marmol, and attributed to the baboons of the <PB N="111" REF="118"> Cape the manners and di&s;po&s;itions of Maurita|nian pigmies.</P>
<P>The pigmy, the Barbary ape, and the baboon, were known to the antients; the&s;e animals are found in A&s;ia Minor, Arabia, Upper Egypt, and in all the northern parts of Africa. Hence this pa&s;&s;age of Marmol may be applied to all the three. But it corre&s;ponds not with the baboon; for it mentions, that the&s;e apes have no tails. Neither is it the Barbary ape, but the pigmy, of which this author treats; for the Barbary ape is not ea&s;ily tamed, and, in&s;tead of four or five, it generally produces only two young. But the pigmy, being &s;maller, &s;hould produce a greater number. Be&s;ides, it is milder and more docile than the Barbary ape, who is never perfectly tamed. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I am convinced that it is not the Barbary ape, but the pigmy, to which the pa&s;&s;age in the above author ought to be ap|plied. The &s;ame remark is applicable to a pa&s;|&s;age of Rubruquis; when mentioning the apes of Cathay, he remarks, 'That, in every article, they are fa&s;hioned like man. . . . That they are more than a foot and a half high, and all covered with hair; that they live in caverns; that, in order to &s;eize them, the natives put &s;trong inebriating liquors in the caverns they frequent;. . . . that they a&s;&s;emble together to drink the&s;e liquors, crying <HI>chinchin,</HI> from which they have obtained the name of <HI>chinchin</HI>; and that, after intoxicating them&s;elves, they fall <PB N="112" REF="119"> a&s;leep, when they are ea&s;ily taken by the hun|ters.' The&s;e characters corre&s;pond with the pigmy, and by no means with the Barbary ape. The latter we have &s;een alive, and never heard it cry <HI>chinchin.</HI> Be&s;ides, it is much more than a foot and a half high, and has not &s;o great a re&s;emblance to man as the author alledges. We have the &s;ame rea&s;ons for applying to the pigmy the figure and remark of Pro&s;per Alpinus: He tells us, that the &s;mall apes without tails, which he &s;aw in Egypt, tame &s;ooner and more ea&s;ily than any other; that they have likewi&s;e more &s;a|gacity and indu&s;try, and are gayer and more fro|lic&s;ome. Now, the Barbary ape is thick, and of a con&s;iderable &s;tature; it is a dirty, ferocious, melancholy animal, and is never fully tamed. Hence the characters given by Pro&s;per Alpinus to his ape without a tail, apply not to the Bar|bary ape, and can belong to no other animal than the pigmy.</P>

<P><HI>Gibbon</HI> is the name under which M. Dupleix gave us this a|nimal, which he brought from the Ea&s;t Indies. I fir&s;t imagined this to be an Indian word.

The following is the pa&s;&s;age of Pliny, with Dale|champ's note; <Q>'Pompeii Magni primum Iudi o&s;tenderunt ex Ethiopia quas vocant <HI>cephos</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cephos</HI>; Strabo. lib. 15. <GAP DESC="foreign"> vocat, e&s;&s;eque tradit facie &s;atyro &s;imilem; <HI>Dal.

<P>THE Gibbon keeps him&s;elf always erect, e|ven when he walks on four feet; becau&s;e his arms are as long as both his body and legs. We have &s;een him alive. He exceeded not three feet in height; but he was young, and in cap|tivity. Hence we may pre&s;ume, that he had not acquired his full dimen&s;ions, and that, in a natural &s;tate, he might arrive at four feet. He has not the ve&s;tige of a tail. But he is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed <PB N="114" REF="121"> from the other apes by the prodigious length of his arms: When &s;tanding erect on his hind feet, his hands touch the ground; and he can walk on his four feet without bending his body. Round the face there is a circle of white, which gives him a very extraordinary appear|ance. His eyes are large, but deep &s;unk. His ears are naked. His face is flat, of a tawny co|lour, and pretty &s;imilar to that of man. After the orang-outang and the pigmy, the gibbon would make the neare&s;t approach to the human figure, if he was not deformed by the exce&s;&s;ive length of his arms; for, in a &s;tate of nature, man would likewi&s;e have a &s;trange a&s;pect. The hair and the beard, if neglected, would form round his countenance a circle &s;imilar to that which &s;urrounds the face of the gibbon.</P>
<P>This ape appeared to be of a tranquil di&s;po|&s;ition, and of gentle manners. His movements were neither too bri&s;k nor precipitant. He re|ceived mildly what was given him to eat. He was fed with bread, fruits, almonds, &amp;c. He was afraid of cold and moi&s;ture, and did not live long in a foreign climate. He is a native of the Ea&s;t Indies, and particularly of Coroman|del, Malacca, and the Molucca i&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father le Comte tells us, that he &s;aw in the Molucca's a kind of ape, which walked naturally on two feet, u&s;ed its hands like a man, and had a face like that of a Hottentot. But the whole body was covered with a kind of gray wool. It had an exact re&s;emblance to an infant, and expre&s;&s;ed its pa&s;&s;ions and appetites in the mo&s;t perfect manner.

<P>OF all the apes without tails<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is certain that this ape has no tail, though there is a &s;light appearance of one, formed by a &s;mall appendix of &s;kin about half an inch long, and &s;ituated above the anus. But this appendix has no vertebrae, and is only a portion of &s;kin, which adheres not more to the coccix than to the re&s;t of the &s;kin.</NOTE>, the Magot agrees be&s;t with the temperature of our climate. We kept one &s;everal years. In &s;um|mer, he delighted to be in the open air; and, in winter, he might be kept in a room without fire. Though by no means delicate, he was al|ways melancholy, and &s;ometimes dirty. He u&s;ed the &s;ame grimaces to mark his anger, or to expre&s;s his appetite. His movements were bri&s;k, his manners gro&s;s, and his a&s;pect more ugly than <PB N="118" REF="127"> ridiculous. When agitated with pa&s;&s;ion, he ex|hibited and grinded his teeth. He filled the pouches of his cheeks with the food which was given him, and generally eat every thing, ex|cept raw fle&s;h, chee&s;e, and whatever had under|gone a kind of fermentation. When about to &s;leep, he loved to perch upon an iron or wooden bar. He was always chained; becau&s;e, though he had been long in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, he was not civilized, and had no attachment to his ma&s;ters. He &s;eems to have been ill educated; for I have &s;een others of the &s;ame &s;pecies more intelligent, more obedient, more gay, and &s;o docile as to learn to dance, to make ge&s;ticulations in cadence, and to allow them&s;elves peaceably to be clo|thed.</P>
<P>This ape, when erect upon his two hind legs, is generally two feet and a half, or three feet high; the female is &s;maller than the male. He walks more willingly on four feet than on two. When re&s;ting, he commonly &s;upports his body on two prominent callo&s;ities, which are &s;ituated where the buttocks ought to be: The anus is placed higher. Hence his body is more inclined than that of a man, when &s;itting. He differs from the pigmy or ape properly &s;o called: 1. Becau&s;e his muzzle is thick and long, as in the dog; but the face of the pigmy is flat; 2. Becau&s;e he has very long canine teeth; 3. Be|cau&s;e his nails and fingers are neither &s;o flat nor &s;o round; and, 4. Becau&s;e he is larger, more <PB N="119" REF="128"> &s;quat, and of a more ferocious and untractable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome varieties in this &s;pecies. We have &s;een magots of different &s;izes, and with hair more or le&s;s deeply coloured, and more or le&s;s bu&s;hy.

<P>IN man, the phy&s;iognomy is deceitful, and the figure of his body gives no indication of the qualities of his mind. But, in the brute creation, we may judge of the di&s;po&s;ition by the a&s;pect; for every internal quality appears externally. For example, in looking at the apes and baboons, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that the latter ought to be the mo&s;t &s;avage and mi&s;chievous. Their manners differ as much as their figures. The orang-ou|tang has the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to man; and he is the mo&s;t grave, docile, and intelligent of the whole race. The Barbary ape, which begins to recede from the human figure, and approaches to that of the brutes by his muzzle and canine teeth, is bri&s;k, di&s;obedient, and na&s;ty. The ba|boons, who re&s;emble man in the hands only, and who have a tail, &s;harp nails, a large muzzle, &amp;c. have the air of ferocious bea&s;ts, which they are in effect. The baboon, of which a figure is <PB N="122" REF="133"> here given, I &s;aw alive. He was not perfectly hideous; and yet he excited a degree of horror. Perpetually grinding his teeth, fretting and chafing with rage, his owner was obliged to keep him confined in an iron cage, the bars of which he moved &s;o powerfully with his hands, that he in&s;pired the &s;pectators with terror. He is a &s;quat animal, who&s;e compact body and ner|vous members indicate &s;trength and agility. He is covered with long clo&s;e hair, which gives him the appearance of being larger than he is in re|ality. His &s;trength, however, is &s;o great, that he would ea&s;ily overcome one or &s;everal men, if not provided with arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to this &s;pecies that the animal called <HI>tr&eacute;, tr&eacute;, tr&eacute;, tr&eacute;,</HI> at Madaga&s;car, ought to be referred. It is as large, &s;ays Fla|court, as a calf of two years old. It has a round head, and the face of a man. The fore and hind feet are like tho&s;e of the ape. The hair is cri&s;ped, the tail &s;hort, and the ears re|&s;emble tho&s;e of man. It is &s;imilar to the <HI>tanach</HI> de&s;cribed by Ambro&s;e Pary. It is a &s;olitary animal, and much dreaded by the natives; <HI>Voyage &agrave; Madaga&s;car, p.</HI> 151.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, he is con|tinually agitated by that pa&s;&s;ion which renders the gentle&s;t animals ferocious. He is in&s;olently &s;alacious, affects to &s;how him&s;elf in this &s;itua|tion, and &s;eems to gratify his de&s;ires, <HI>per manum &s;uum,</HI> before the whole world. This dete&s;table action recalls the idea of vice, and renders di&s;|gu&s;tful the a&s;pect of an animal, which Nature &s;eems to have particularly devoted to &s;uch an uncommon &s;pecies of impudence; for, in all o|ther <PB N="123" REF="134"> animals, and even in man, &s;he has covered the&s;e parts with a veil.

In this &s;pe|cies, there &s;eem to be races &s;till larger, and others much &s;maller. We have given figures both of the large and &s;mall kinds, in which we can per|ceive no other difference but that of magnitude. This difference, however, proceeds not from age; for the &s;mall baboon appeared to be an a|dult as well as the large. The females are &s;ub|ject to the men&s;trual di&s;charge*</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="note">
<P>* In Augu&s;t 1779, a male baboon, remarkable for its mag|nitude, &s;trength, and beautiful colours, was exihibited at Edin|burgh. It was generally thought to be a variety of the man|drill de&s;cribed by Ge&s;ner, Buffon, Ray, Linnaeus, and Bri&s;|&s;on. But, as it differed from the mandrill of the&s;e authors in <PB N="126" REF="139">a number of characters, the Tran&s;lator cau&s;ed a drawing of it to be made. [See the plate]. The mandrill is &s;aid not to exceed two feet in length. But this baboon, when erect, was near five feet high. The mandrill is repre&s;ented as a good-natured, though not a &s;portive animal. This baboon, on the contrary, was exce&s;&s;ively fierce, pre&s;ented uniformly to the &s;pectators the mo&s;t threatening a&s;pect, and attempted to &s;eize every per&s;on who came within reach of his chain. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, he made a deep grunting noi&s;e, and to&s;&s;ed up his head almo&s;t perpetually. The baboon de&s;cribed by Buffon <Q>pre&s;ented his hind parts more frequently than his front, e&s;pecially when he &s;aw women.</Q> But this baboon uniformly pre&s;ented his face, and allowed no per&s;on to ap|proach him behind. The Count de Buffon remarks, that the mandrill is an animal of the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting deformity, and that he perpetually licks a &s;not which runs from his no&s;e. But the baboon under con&s;ideration was an animal of great beauty, and had no vi&s;ible di&s;tillation from his no&s;trils.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, Mr Pennant obligingly communi|cated to the Tran&s;lator the proof &s;heet of a new and elegant edition of his excellent Synop&s;is of Quadrupeds, in which is contained the following accurate de&s;cription of this animal, under the appellation of the <HI>Great Baboon.</HI></P>

Head, arms, and legs, covered with &s;hort hair, yellow and black intermixed; the brea&s;t with long, whiti&s;h, yellow hairs; the &s;houlders with long brown hair.</P>

<P>This was de&s;cribed from a &s;tuffed &s;pecimen in Sir A&s;hton Lever's mu&s;eum. In October 1779, a live animal of this &s;pecies was &s;hown at Che&s;ter, which differed a little in co|lour from the above, being in general much darker. Eyes much &s;unk in the head, and &s;mall. On the internal &s;ide of each ear was a white line, pointing upwards. The hair on the forehead turned up, like a toup&eacute;e. Feet black; in other re&s;pects re&s;embled the former.</P>
<P>In this I had an opportunity of examining the teeth. The cutting teeth were like tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the genus; but, in the upper and lower jaw, were two canine, or rather tu&s;ks, near three inches long, and exceedingly &s;harp and pointed.</P>
<P>This animal was five feet high, of a mo&s;t tremendous &s;trength in all its parts; was exce&s;&s;ively fierce, libidinous, and &s;trong.</P>
<P>Mr Schreber &s;ays, that this &s;pecies lives on &s;ucculent fruits, and on nuts; is very fond of eggs, and will put eight at once into its pouches, and, taking them out one by one, break them at the end, and &s;wallow the yolk and white: Re|jects all fle&s;h-meat, unle&s;s it be dre&s;&s;ed: Would drink quan|tities of wine or brandy: Was le&s;s agile than other baboons: Very cleanly; for it would immediately fling its excrements out of its hut.</P>
<P>That which was &s;hown at Che&s;ter was particularly fond of chee&s;e. Its voice was a kind of roar, not unlike that of a lion, but low and &s;omewhat inward. It went upon all fours, and never &s;tood on its hind legs, unle&s;s forced by the keeper; but would frequently &s;it on its rump in a crouch|ing manner, and drop its arms before the belly.</P>

<P>To this de&s;cription very little can be added. In the indi|vidual &s;hown at Edinburgh, which was probably the &s;ame that Mr Pennant afterwards &s;aw at Che&s;ter, the colours of the face were di&s;tinct and unmixed. The ribbed cheeks were of a &s;ky-blue colour. A vermilion line began a little above the eyes, and running down between them, and on each &s;ide of <PB N="128" REF="141">the no&s;e, &s;pread over the &s;nout. The in&s;ide of the ears was blue, which, &s;oftening from purple, terminated in vermilion. The beard, at the roots, was of the &s;ame dark brown colour with that on upper part of the body; but it &s;oon changed into a deep orange, and ended in yellow. The hairs on the belly were of an a&s;h-colour, and &s;peckled like the &s;ides of a partridge. The rump was of a vermillion colour; and the beautiful colours on the hips were only gradations from red to blue. If it had any callo&s;ities on the buttocks, they were not apparent. The penis was nearly of the &s;ame red colour with the rump; that of the te&s;ticles was more fiery, and &s;of|tened into a light blue, which likewi&s;e &s;pread over the in&s;ide of the thighs.&mdash;It was very fond of the ears of wheat, the grains of which it dexterou&s;ly picked out, one by one, with its teeth.</P>

<P>THE uggline&s;s of this baboon is perfectly di&s;gu&s;ting. His no&s;e, or rather his two no&s;trils, are flat, from which a &s;not perpetually runs, and he licks it into his mouth with his tongue. His head is very large, and his muzzle long. His body is &s;quat, and his buttocks are of a blood colour. His anus is con&s;picuous, and &s;ituated almo&s;t as high as the loins. His face is of a violet colour, and &s;urrounded on each &s;ide with deep longitudinal wrinkles, which <PB N="130" REF="145"> augment the &s;ullenne&s;s and deformity of his a&s;pect. He is likewi&s;e larger, and perhaps &s;trong|er than the baboon; but, at the &s;ame time, he is more peaceable, and le&s;s ferocious. We here give figures of both the male and the female, which we have &s;een alive. Whether they had received a better education, or if they be natu|rally more gentle than the baboon, they appear|ed to be more tractable and le&s;s impudent; but they were equally di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of baboon is found on the Gold Coa&s;t, and in the other &s;outhern provinces of Africa, where he is called <HI>boggo</HI> by the Negroes, and <HI>mandrill</HI> by the Europeans. Next to the orang-outang, he is the large&s;t of all the apes or baboons. Smith relates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bodies of the mandrill, when full grown, are as big in circumference as a middle-&s;ized man's. Their legs much &s;horter, and their feet longer, their arms and hands in pro|portion. The head is mon&s;trou&s;ly big, and the face broad and flat, without any other hair but the eye-brows; the no&s;e very &s;mall, the mouth wide, and the lips thin. The face, which is covered by a white &s;kin, is extremely ugly, being all over wrinkled as with old age; the teeth broad and very yellow; the hands have no more hair than the face, but the &s;ame white &s;kin, though all the re&s;t of the body is covered with long black hair like a bear. They never go upon all four like apes, but cry when vexed or teazed, ju&s;t like chil|dren. It is &s;aid, that the males often attack and u&s;e violence to the Black women, wherever they meet them alone in the woods. They are generally very &s;notty-no&s;ed, and take great delight in &s;craping it down from their no&s;es to their mouths. When I was at Skerbro one Mr Cummerbus made me a pre|&s;ent of one of the&s;e &s;trange animals, which are called by the natives <HI>Boggoe.</HI> It was a &s;he-cub of &s;ix months age, but was then larger than a baboon: <HI>Smith's voyage to Guinea, p.</HI> 51. In the &s;ame country, this animal is called <HI>boogoc</HI> or <HI>boggo,</HI> and <HI>mandrill,</HI> and they likewi&s;e call the orang-outang, <HI>pongo</HI> and <HI>drill.</HI> There is much &s;imilarity in the&s;e names, and they are probably derived from each other: And, in fact, the pongo and boggo, or the drill and mandrill, have &s;everal common characters. But the fir&s;t is an ape without a tail, almo&s;t na|ked, and with a flat oval face; and the &s;econd is a baboon with a tail, long hair, and a thick and long muzzle. <HI>Man,</HI> in the German and Engli&s;h languages, &s;ignifies <HI>man</HI> in gene|ral; and <HI>drill,</HI> in the jargon of &s;ome of our French provinces, denotes a <HI>vigorous libertine.</HI></NOTE>, that he had a pre|&s;ent <PB N="131" REF="146"> of a female mandrill, which was only &s;ix months old, and that it was as large as an adult baboon. He adds, that the&s;e mandrills walk al|ways on two feet; that they weep and groan like men; that they have a violent pa&s;&s;ion for women, which they never fail to gratify when they find a woman at a di&s;tance from relief.</P>

<P>The mandrill has cheek-pouches, and callo|&s;ities on the buttocks. The tail exceeds not two or three inches. The canine teeth are much thicker and longer than tho&s;e of man. The muzzle is very thick, very long, and furrowed on each &s;ide with deep longitudinal wrinkles. The face is naked, and of a bluei&s;h colour. The ears, as well as the palm of the hands and &s;oles of the feet, are naked. The hair is long, <PB N="132" REF="147"> of a reddi&s;h brown upon the body, and gray upon the brea&s;t and belly.

Others of the &s;ame &s;pecies are totally white.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e two animals appear to belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, we have pre|&s;erved to each of them the proper names they receive in Ceylon, which is their native coun|try; becau&s;e they con&s;titute, at lea&s;t, two di|&s;tinct and permanent races. The body of the ouanderou is covered with brown and black hairs; it has a bu&s;hy head, and a large beard. The body of the lowando, on the con|trary, is covered with whiti&s;h hairs, and the hair on its head and beard is black. In the &s;ame country, there is a third race or variety, which <PB N="134" REF="150"> is probably the common &s;tock of the other two; for the hair on its body, head, and beard, is of one uniform white colour. The&s;e three ani|mals are not apes, but baboons, of which they have all the characters both in figure and di&s;po|&s;itions. They are wild, and even ferocious. Their muzzle is long, their tail &s;hort, and they are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize and &s;trength as the baboons. Their bodies are indeed le&s;s &s;quat, and their hind parts &s;eem to be more feeble. That of which we have given a figure, was ex|hibited to us under fal&s;e appellations, both with regard to its name and climate. Its owners told us, that it came from the continent of America, and that it was called <HI>cayouva&s;&s;ou.</HI> I &s;oon re|collected that this word <HI>cayouva&s;&s;ou</HI> is a Bra&s;ili|an term, which is pronounced <HI>&s;ajuoua&s;&s;ou,</HI> and &s;ignifies <HI>&s;apajou</HI>; and, con&s;equently, that it was improperly applied; &s;ince all the &s;apajous have very long tails. But the animal under con&s;ide|ration is a baboon with a very &s;hort tail. Be|&s;ides, not a &s;ingle &s;pecies of baboon exi&s;ts in A|merica. Errors with regard to climate are very common, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e who exhibit wild bea&s;ts: When they are ignorant of the cli|mate and the name of an animal, they fail not to give it a foreign denomination, which, whether true or fal&s;e, equally &s;erves their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e baboon-ouanderous, when not tamed, are &s;o mi&s;chievous, that they mu&s;t be kept in iron cages, where they are frequently agitated <PB N="135" REF="151"> with va&s;t fury. But, when taken young, they are ea&s;ily tamed, and appear to be even more &s;u&s;ceptible of education than the other baboons. The Indians delight in in&s;tructing the&s;e animals, and pretend that the other apes, that is, the monkeys, have a great re&s;pect for the baboons, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more gravity and intelli|gence. In a &s;tate of liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Malabar, we find four &s;pecies of apes: The fir&s;t is all black and lu&s;trous, with a white beard, which &s;urrounds its chin, and is more than a palm in length. The other apes have &s;uch a re&s;pect for this &s;pecies, that they humble them|&s;elves in its pre&s;ence, as if they were con&s;cious of its &s;uperio|rity. The Princes and Nobles e&s;teem tho&s;e bearded apes; becau&s;e they appear to have more gravity and intelligence than the other kinds. They are educated for ceremonies and &s;ports, in which they acquit them&s;elves to the admiration of the &s;pectators; <HI>Voyage du Pere Vincent Marie, p.</HI> 405.</NOTE>, they are extreme|ly wild, and keep perpetually in the woods<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Ceylon, there are monkeys as large as our &s;paniels.

<P>THE apes, baboons, and monkeys, form three tribes, with intervals between each, the fir&s;t of which is filled by the magot, and the &s;econd by the maimon. The latter con&s;titutes the link or &s;hade between the baboons and mon|keys, as the magot does between the apes and baboons. In effect, the maimon re&s;embles the baboons by the thickne&s;s and largene&s;s of his muzzle, and by his &s;hort, arched tail; but he differs from them, and approaches the monkeys, by the &s;mallne&s;s of his &s;ize, and the mildne&s;s of his nature. Mr Edwards has given a figure and de&s;cription of the maimon, under the denomi|nation of the <HI>pig-tailed ape.</HI> This peculiar cha|racter <PB N="138" REF="155"> is &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h him; for, of all the baboons or monkeys, he alone has a naked, &s;lender, and arched tail, like that of a pig. He is nearly of the &s;ize of the magot, and has &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the macaque, or hare-lipped monkey, that he might be regarded as a variety of this &s;pecies, if his tail were not totally different. He has a naked, tawny face, che&s;nut-coloured eyes, black eye-lids, a flat no&s;e, and thin lips, with &s;ome &s;tiff hairs, but too &s;hort to form whi&s;kers. He has not, like the apes and baboons, his te&s;ticles and penis prominent and apparent; the whole organs are concealed un|der the &s;kin. Hence the maimon, though vi|vacious and full of fire, has none of that impu|dent petulance peculiar to the baboons. He is gentle, tractable, and even care&s;&s;ing. He is found in Sumatra, and probably in other &s;ou|thern provinces of India; of cour&s;e, he endures with difficulty the cold of our climate.

<P>OF all the <HI>guenons,</HI> or monkeys with long tails, the macaque makes the neare&s;t ap|proach to the baboons. Like them, his body is <PB N="141" REF="159"> &s;hort and &s;quat, his head and muzzle large, his no&s;e flat, his cheeks wrinkled, and, at the &s;ame time, he exceeds mo&s;t of the other monkeys in &s;ize. He is al&s;o extremely ugly; &s;o that he might be regarded as a &s;mall &s;pecies of baboon, if his tail were not long and bu&s;hy, while that of the baboons in general is very &s;hort. This &s;pecies is a native of Congo, and other &s;outhern provinces of Africa. It is numerous, and &s;ubject to &s;everal varieties in &s;ize, in colour, and in the di&s;po&s;ition of the hair. The body of that de&s;cribed by Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t was more than two feet long; and tho&s;e we have &s;een exceeded not a foot and a half. The one we have denominated
<HI>egret,</HI> becau&s;e it has a cre&s;t or tuft of hair on the top of the head, appears to be only a variety of the macaque, which it re&s;embles in every article, except this, and &s;ome other &s;light differences in the hair. They are both of mild manners, and extremely tractable. But, independent of a di&s;|agreeable mu&s;ky odour which they both diffu&s;e, they are &s;o dirty, &s;o ugly, and &s;o loath&s;ome, that, when they make their grimaces, they cannot be viewed without horror and di&s;gu&s;t. The&s;e monkeys go often in troops, e&s;pecially in their expeditions to rob gardens. Bo&s;man relates, that they take in each paw a quantity of millet, <PB N="142" REF="160"> and an equal quantity under their arms and in their mouths; that they return thus loaded leaping on their hind feet, and, when pur&s;ued, they drop the &s;talks which they held under their arms and in their hands, pre&s;erving only what they carry in their teeth, to enable them to run with more &s;peed on their four feet. He adds, that they examine, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous accuracy, every &s;talk of millet they pull, and, if it does not plea&s;e them, they throw it on the ground, and tear up others. By this delicacy of choice, they do more damage than by their robberies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Bo&s;man, p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The macaque has cheek-pouches and callo&s;i|ties on his buttocks. His tail is from eighteen to twenty inches long. His head is large, his muzzle very thick, and his face naked, livid, and wrinkled. His ears are covered with hair. His body is &s;hort and &s;quat, and his limbs thick and &s;hort. The hair on the &s;uperior parts of his body is of a greeni&s;h a&s;h-colour, and of a yel|lowi&s;h gray on the brea&s;t and belly. He has a &s;mall cre&s;t of hair on the top of the head. He walks on four and &s;ometimes on two feet. The length of his body, comprehending that of the head, is about eighteen or twenty inches. In this &s;pecies, there appear to be races much lar|ger, <PB REF="161" MS="y">

<P>THE Patas belongs to the &s;ame country, and is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize with the macaque; but his body is longer, his face le&s;s hideous, and his hair more beautiful. He is re|markable for the brilliancy of his robe, which is of &s;o vivid a red as to have the appearance of being painted. We have &s;een two varieties of this &s;pecies. The fir&s;t has a black line above the eyes, which extends from ear to ear. The &s;e|cond differs from the fir&s;t only in the colour of this line, which is white. Both have long hair under the chin and round the cheeks, which makes a fine beard: But, in the fir&s;t, it is yel|low, and, in the &s;econd, white. This variety &s;eems to indicate others in the colour of the hair; and I am inclined to think, that the monkey <PB N="145" REF="165"> mentioned by Marmol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The apes of the colour of a wild cat, with a long tail, and a white or black muzzle, commonly called in Spain <HI>Galos|paul&eacute;s,</HI> come from the Negro country; <HI>L'Afrique de Marmol, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 57.</NOTE>, which is of the colour of a wild cat, and &s;aid to come from the Negro country, is a variety of the patas.</P>
<P>The&s;e monkeys are not equally dexterous as the other kinds; and, at the &s;ame time, they are extremely inqui&s;itive. <Q>'I have &s;een them,' &s;ays Brue, 'de&s;cend from the tops of the trees to the extremities of the branches, in order to ad|mire the barks as they pa&s;&s;ed.

Some of them &s;ell, others were wounded, and the re&s;t were &s;truck with a &s;trange con&s;ternation. One party rai&s;ed hide|ous cries; another collected &s;tones to throw at the enemy: Some of them, with their bowels in their hands, attempted to throw their in|trails at the &s;pectators.

<P>It is probably of this &s;pecies of monkey which le Maire &s;peaks of in the following terms: <Q>'The havock which the&s;e monkeys make in the fields of Senegal, when the millet and other grains are ripe, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed.

When he perceives any per&s;on, he &s;ets up loud &s;hrieks to alarm the band, who obey the &s;ignal, fly off with their prey, leaping from tree to tree with prodigious agility.

<P>THESE two monkeys &s;eem to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which, though different in &s;ome re&s;pects from that of the Macaque, makes &s;o near an approach to it, that we are doubtful whether the macaque, the egret, the malbrouck, and the Chine&s;e-bonnet, are only four varieties, or permanent races, of the &s;ame &s;pecies. As the&s;e animals produce not in our climate, we cannot a&s;certain the identity or diver&s;ity of their &s;pecies, but mu&s;t judge from the differences in their figure and in their external qualities. The macaque and the egret are &s;o &s;imilar, that we pre&s;umed them to be one &s;pecies. It is the &s;ame with the malbrouck and Chine&s;e-bonnet. But, as the latter differ from the former more than they differ between them&s;elves, we thought it be&s;t to &s;eparate them.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;umption, with regard to the diver&s;ity of the&s;e two &s;pecies, is founded, 1. On the dif|ference <PB N="149" REF="171"> in their figure; 2. On that of the colour and di&s;po&s;ition of the hair; 3. On the different proportions in the &s;keletons of the two kinds; and, in fine, on the two former being natives of the &s;outhern regions of Africa, while the two latter are natives of Bengal. This la&s;t con&s;ideration is of equal weight with any of the others; for we have &s;hown, that, in wild animals totally in|dependent of man, the di&s;tance of climate is a pretty certain indication of remotene&s;s of &s;pe|cies. Be&s;ides, the malbrouck and Chine&s;e-bon|net are not the only &s;pecies or races of monkeys found in Bengal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The monkey of Calicut, with grayi&s;h hair, mentioned by Pyrard, &s;hould probably be referred to the malbrouck &s;pe|cies. In this country, the killing of monkeys is prohibited. They are &s;o importunate, trouble&s;ome, and numerous, that they do much damage. The inhabitants of the towns and villages are obliged to lattice their windows, to prevent the monkeys from entering their hou&s;es; <HI>Voyages de Fr. Pyrard, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 427.</NOTE> It appears, from the evi|dence of travellers, that there are four varieties, namely, white, black, red, and gray monkeys. They alledge that the black kind are mo&s;t ea&s;i|ly tamed. Tho&s;e we &s;aw were of a reddi&s;h gray colour, and appeared to be tame, and even docile.</P>
<P>'The&s;e animals,' travellers remark<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages d'Inigo de Biervillas, p. 172.</NOTE> '&s;teal fruits, and particularly the &s;ugar cane. One &s;tands &s;entinel on a tree, while the others load them&s;elves with the booty. If he perceives any per&s;on, he cries <HI>houp, houp, houp,</HI> with a <PB N="150" REF="172"> loud and di&s;tinct voice. The moment this &s;ignal is given, the whole troop throw down the canes they held in their left hand, and run off on three feet. When pur&s;ued hard, they quit what they had in their right hand, and &s;ave them&s;elves by climbing trees, which are the u&s;ual places of their abode. They leap from tree to tree; and even the females, though loaded with their young, which they hold firmly, leap like the others; but they &s;ometimes fall. The&s;e animals are never more than half-tamed, and always require a chain. Even in their own country, they never pro|duce, when in bondage: They require to be at perfect freedom in the woods. When fruits and &s;ucculent plants fail, they eat in&s;ects, and &s;ometimes de&s;cend to the margins of rivers, and the &s;ea-coa&s;t, to catch fi&s;hes and crabs. They put their tail between the pincers of the crab, and, whenever the pincers are clo&s;ed, they carry it quickly off, and eat it at their lei&s;ure. They gather cocoa nuts, and are well acquainted with the method of extracting the juice for drink, and the kernel for food. They likewi&s;e drink the <HI>zari</HI> which drops from the
<HI>bamboos,</HI> which they place on the tops of trees, in order to extract the liquors; and they u&s;e it occa&s;ionally. They are taken by means of a cocoa nut, with a &s;mall hole made in it. They put their paw into the hole with difficul|ty <PB N="151" REF="173"> becau&s;e it is narrow; and the people who are watching, &s;eize them before they can di&s;|engage them&s;elves. In the provinces of India inhabited by the Bramins, who kill no ani|mals, the number of monkeys, which are high|ly venerated, is almo&s;t infinite. They come in troops into the cities, and enter the hou&s;es at all times with perfect freedom; &s;o that tho&s;e who &s;ell provi&s;ions, and particularly fruits, pot-herbs, &amp;c. have much difficulty in pre&s;er|ving their commodities.' In Amadabad, the capital of Guzarat, there are three ho&s;pitals for animals, where lame and &s;ick monkeys, and even tho&s;e who, without being di&s;ea&s;ed, choo&s;e to dwell there, are fed and cheri&s;hed. Twice every week, the monkeys in the neighbourhood a&s;|&s;emble &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the &s;treets of the city. They then mount upon the hou&s;es, each of which has a &s;mall terrace, or flat roof, where they lie during the great heats. On the&s;e two days, the inhabitants fail not to lay upon the&s;e terraces rice, millet, &s;ugar canes, and other fruits in their &s;ea&s;on; for, if the&s;e animals, by any accident, find not their provi&s;ions in the accu&s;tomed place, they break the tiles which cover the re&s;t of the hou&s;e, and commit great outrages. They never eat any thing, without thoroughly examining it; and, when full, they fill their cheek-pouches for another occa&s;ion. In places frequented by the monkeys, the birds dare not build their ne&s;ts on <PB N="152" REF="174"> the trees; for they never fail to de&s;troy the ne&s;ts, and da&s;h the eggs on the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les voyages de la Boulaye le Gouz, p. 253.

<HI>nonne</HI> from a corruption of <HI>mone</HI> or <HI>mona,</HI> and o|thers the <HI>old man,</HI> on account of its gray beard. But the vulgar appellation of <HI>varied monkey</HI> is be&s;t known, and corre&s;ponds with the Greek name <HI>kebos,</HI> and Ari&s;totle's definition of the

<P>In general, the monkeys have milder di&s;po&s;i|tions than the baboons, and their character is le&s;s melancholy than that of the apes. They are extravagantly vivacious; but have no fero|city; for they become tractable the moment their attention is fixed by fear or re&s;traint. The mona is particularly &s;u&s;ceptible of education, and even of &s;ome attachment to tho&s;e who take <PB N="158" REF="184"> care of him. The one we kept allowed him|&s;elf to be touched and carried about by the peo|ple with whom he was acquainted; but, to o|thers, he permitted not this freedom, and even bit them. He likewi&s;e endeavoured to obtain his liberty: He was fixed with a long chain. When he could either break the chain or di&s;en|gage him&s;elf, he fled to the fields, and, though he did not &s;pontaneou&s;ly return, he allowed him&s;elf to be taken by his ma&s;ter. He eat every thing, roa&s;ted meat, bread, and particular|ly fruits. He likewi&s;e &s;earched for &s;piders, ants, and in&s;ects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probably this &s;pecies which Ludolf mentions under the denomination of the <HI>Aby&s;&s;inian ape.</HI> 'They come,' &s;ays he, 'in great troops.

<P><HI>CALLITRIX</HI> is a term employed by Ho|mer, to denote, in general, the beautiful colour of the hair of animals. It was not till &s;everal ages after Homer's time, that the Greeks applied this name to particular &s;pecies of mon|keys. Its application to the animal under con|&s;ideration is peculiarly proper. The body is of a beautiful green colour, the throat and belly are white, and the face is of a fine black. He is found in Mauritania, and in the territories of antient Carthage.

He is allied to the monkeys by the length of his tail, to the baboons by his &s;ize, and to the apes by his flat face. He &s;eems, by a particular cha|racter, to form the &s;hade between the monkey's and &s;apajous: In the&s;e two tribes of animals, the monkeys are di&s;tingui&s;hed by naked buttocks, and all the &s;apajous have the&s;e parts covered with hair: Of all the monkeys the douc has hair on the buttocks, like the &s;apajous.

Be&s;ides, the inter|val which &s;eparates the two tribes is immen&s;e; for the douc and all the monkeys belong to the Old Continent, and all the &s;apajous are natives of the New World. It may likewi&s;e be remark|ed, that, as the douc, like the monkeys, has a long tail, but has no callo&s;ities on the buttocks, he forms the &s;hade between the orang-outangs and monkeys; as the gibbon does on another account, having no tail, like the orang-outangs, but, like the monkeys, having callo&s;ities on the buttocks. Independent of the&s;e general rela|tions, the douc has peculiar characters which render him di&s;tingui&s;hable, at fir&s;t &s;ight, from the apes, baboons, monkeys, and &s;apajous. His robe, which is variegated with many colours, &s;eems to indicate the ambiguity of his nature, and di&s;tingui&s;hes his &s;pecies in a con&s;picuous manner.

The top of the front and the up|per part of the arms, are black. The under parts of the body are of a cinereous gray and a whiti&s;h yellow colour. The tail and under part of the loins are white. He walks as often on two as on four feet. When erect, he is three and a half or four feet high. It is uncertain whether the females of this &s;pecies be &s;ubject to the men&s;trual di&s;charge.</P>

<P>WE now pa&s;s from the Old Continent to the New. All the four-handed animals formerly de&s;cribed, and which were compre|hended under the generic names of <HI>apes, baboons,</HI> and <HI>monkeys,</HI> belong exclu&s;ively to the Old Con|tinent; and all the re&s;t, who&s;e hi&s;tory we are a|bout to relate, are found only in the New World. We fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h them by the two generic names <HI>&s;apajous</HI> and <HI>&s;agoins.</HI> The feet of both are con&s;tructed nearly in the &s;ame man|ner with tho&s;e of the apes, baboon, and mon|keys. But they differ from the apes by having tails. They differ from the baboons by the want of cheek-pouches and callo&s;ities on their buttocks. In fine, they differ from the apes, baboons, and monkeys, by having the portion between their no&s;trils very broad and thick, and the apertures placed to a &s;ide and not under the no&s;e. Hence the &s;apajous and &s;agoins differ not only &s;pecifically, but generically from the apes, <PB N="173" REF="204"> baboons, and monkeys. When compared with each other, we likewi&s;e find that they differ in generic characters; for all the &s;apajous have pre|hen&s;ile tails, which are &s;o con&s;tructed that the animals can u&s;e them as fingers to lay hold of any thing. This under part of the tail, which they fold, extend, curl up, or unfold at plea&s;ure, and by the extremity of which they &s;u&s;pend them&s;elves on the branches of trees, is generally deprived of hair, and covered with a &s;mooth &s;kin. The tails of all the &s;agoins, on the con|trary, are proportionally longer than tho&s;e of the &s;apajous, and are &s;traight, flaccid, and entire|ly covered with hair; &s;o that they can neither u&s;e the tail in laying hold of any thing, nor in &s;u&s;pending them&s;elves. This differnce alone is &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;apajou from a &s;a|goin.</P>
<P>We know eight &s;apajous, which may be re|duced to five &s;pecies: 1. The <HI>ouarine</HI> or <HI>gouariba</HI> of Bra&s;il. This &s;apajou is as large as a fox, and differs from the <HI>alouate</HI> of Cayenne in colour only. The hair of the ouarine is black, and that of the alouate is reddi&s;h; and, as they re|&s;emble each other in every other re&s;pect, I con|&s;ider them as belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies. 2. The <HI>coaita,</HI> which is black like the ouarine, but not &s;o large. The <HI>exquima</HI> &s;eems to be a variety of this &s;pecies. 3. The <HI>&s;ajou,</HI> or <HI>&s;apajou</HI> properly &s;o called, is &s;mall, of a brown colour, <PB N="174" REF="205"> and commonly known by the name of the ca|puchin monkey. Of this &s;pecies there is a va|riety, which we &s;hall call the <HI>gray &s;ajou,</HI> to di|&s;tingui&s;h it from the <HI>brown &s;ajou.</HI> 4. The <HI>&s;ai,</HI> which &s;ome travellers have called the <HI>weeper,</HI> is &s;omewhat larger than the &s;ajou, and has a broad|er muzzle. There are two kinds, which differ only in colour, the one being reddi&s;h brown, and the other whiti&s;h red. 5. The <HI>&s;aimiri,</HI> which is commonly called the <HI>orange monkey.</HI> It is the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of the &s;a|pajous.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with &s;ix &s;pecies of &s;agoins: 1. The <HI>&s;aki,</HI> which is the large&s;t, and who&s;e tail is covered with hair &s;o long and bu&s;hy, that it has been called the <HI>fox-tailed monkey.</HI> There &s;eems to be a variety in this &s;pecies. I have &s;een two, both of which appeared to be adults; but the one was almo&s;t twice as large as the o|ther. 2. The <HI>tamarin</HI> is generally black, with the four feet yellow. But they vary in colour; for I have &s;een &s;ome of them brown, and &s;potted with yellow. 3. The <HI>oui&s;titi,</HI> which is remark|able for large tufts of hair round its face, and an annulated tail. 4. The <HI>marikina,</HI> which has a mane round the neck, and bu&s;hy hair, like the lion, at the end of the tail. From this circum|&s;tance it has received the appellation of the <HI>lion|monkey.</HI> 5. The <HI>pinche,</HI> who&s;e face is of a beautiful black colour, with hair which de&s;cends <PB N="175" REF="206"> from the top and each &s;ide of the head, in the form of long &s;mooth tre&s;&s;es. 6. The <HI>mico</HI> is the mo&s;t beautiful of the &s;agoins. Its hair is of a &s;ilver white colour, and its face is as red as ver|milion.</P>

<P>THE Ouarine and Alouate are the large&s;t four-handed animals in the New Conti|nent. In &s;ize they much exceed the large&s;t monkeys, and approach to the magnitude of <PB N="177" REF="208"> baboons. They have prehen&s;ile tails, and con|&s;equently belong to the family of &s;apajous, in which they hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, not only by their &s;tature, but al&s;o by their voice, which re&s;ounds like a drum, and is heard at a great di&s;tance. Maregrave relates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marcgrav. Hi&s;t. Bra&s;. p. 226.</NOTE>, 'That, every morning and evening, the ouarines a&s;&s;emble in the woods; that one of them takes a more e|levated &s;tation, and gives a &s;ignal with his hand for the others to &s;it around and li&s;ten to him; that, when he peceives them to be all &s;eated, he begins a di&s;cour&s;e, in a tone &s;o loud and rapid as to be heard at a great di&s;tance; and a per&s;on would be led to think that the whole were crying together; that all the re&s;t, how|ever, keep the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence; that, when he &s;tops, he gives a &s;ignal with his hand for the others to reply; that, in an in&s;tant, the whole cry together, till he commands &s;ilence by another &s;ignal, which they obey in a mo|ment; that the fir&s;t re&s;umes his di&s;cour&s;e or &s;ong; and that, after hearing him attentively for a con&s;iderable time, the a&s;&s;embly breaks up.' The&s;e facts, which Marcgrave &s;ays he has often witne&s;&s;ed, may perhaps be exaggerated, and &s;ea&s;oned a little with the marvellous: The whole may be founded on the terrible noi&s;e made by the&s;e animals. They have a kind of o&s;&s;eous drum in their throat, in the concavity of which the &s;ound is augmented, multiplied, and <PB N="178" REF="209"> makes a howling noi&s;e. Hence the&s;e &s;apajous have been di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others by the name of <HI>howlers.</HI> We have never &s;een the ou|arine, but have the &s;kin of an alouate, and like|wi&s;e a dried foetus of the &s;ame &s;pecies, in which the bone of the throat, the in&s;trument of the great noi&s;e he makes, is already perceptible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The alouate monkey is a &s;avage animal, of a reddi&s;h bay colour, very large, and, by means of the &s;ingular &s;tructure of the os hyoides, makes a terrible rattling noi&s;e, which is heard at a great di&s;tance: <HI>Barr&egrave;re, Hi&s;t. Franc. Equin. p.</HI> 150.&mdash;In the i&s;land of St. George, under the Tropic, and about two leagues from the continent of America, there are monkeys as large as calves, which make &s;uch a &s;trange noi&s;e, that people who are not accu&s;tomed to it think the mountains are falling.&mdash;They are exceedingly wild; <HI>Voyage de Gentil, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 15.</NOTE>. According to Marcgrave, the ouarine has a large &s;quare face, black and brilliant eyes, &s;hort, round|i&s;h ears, and a tail naked at the extremity, which adheres firmly to every thing it can embrace. The hair on the whole body is black, long, &s;mooth, and lu&s;trous; that on the chin and throat is longer, and forms a kind of round beard; and that on the hands, feet, and part of the tail, is brown. The female is of the &s;ame colour with the male, and differs from him on|ly in being &s;maller. The females carry their young on their back, and leap with them from branch to branch, and from tree to tree. The young embrace with their arms and hands the narrowe&s;t part of the mother's body, and remain firmly fixed as long as &s;he is in motion. Be|&s;ides, <PB N="179" REF="210"> the&s;e animals are &s;o wild and mi&s;chievous, that they can neither be conquered nor tamed. They bite cruelly; and, though not carnivorous, they fail not to excite terror by their frightful voice, and their ferocious a&s;pect. As they feed only upon fruits, pot-herbs, grain, and &s;ome in|&s;ects, their fle&s;h is not bad eating<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monkeys are the mo&s;t common game, and the mo&s;t a|greeable to the ta&s;te of the Amazon Indians.&mdash;Some of them are as large as a greyhound; <HI>Voyage &s;ur la rivi&egrave;re de l'Amazone, par M. de la Condamine, p.</HI> 164.&mdash;Cayenne is the country of monkeys.&mdash;When the reluctance at eating them is once over|come, it is certain that their fle&s;h is very good. It is white, and, though generally not overcharged with fat, it fails not to be tender, delicate, and well ta&s;ted. Fine &s;oup is made of their heads, which are &s;erved up like boiled capons; <HI>Voyage de De&s;marchais, tom.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 311. <HI>et</HI> 338.&mdash;There are monkeys in Cayenne of the &s;ize of large dogs, and of a reddi&s;h colour. They are called <HI>howlers</HI>; becau&s;e, when in troops, they make a noi&s;e like a flock of hogs fighting. They in&s;pire terror, and have very large mouths. I believe they are ferocious. When the Savages &s;hoot them with arrows, they extract the arrow out of their bodies with their hands, like a human creature. The fle&s;h of the howlers is very good, and re|&s;embles mutton. One of them is a meal to &s;ix per&s;ons. They have a horn in their throat, which renders their cries hideous; <HI>Voyage de Binet, p.</HI> 341.&mdash;The Achagua &s;avages along the river Oronoko are fond of the yellow monkeys called <HI>arabata,</HI> which make an in&s;upportable noi&s;e every morning and eve|ning; <HI>Hi&s;t. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, p.</HI> 8.</NOTE>. 
<Q>'The hunt|ers,' Oexmelin remarks, 'bring home in the evening the monkeys they kill in the country of Cape Gracias-a-Dio. They roa&s;t one part of the&s;e monkeys, and boil the other: The fle&s;h is good, and re&s;embles that of the hare; <PB N="180" REF="211"> but it is &s;weeti&s;h, and requires a great deal of &s;alt in dre&s;&s;ing. The fat is very good, and as yellow as that of a capon. We lived upon the&s;e animals during all the time we remained there, becau&s;e we could procure no other food, and the hunters &s;upplied us daily with as many as we could eat. I went to &s;ee this &s;pecies of hunting, and was &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;agacity of the&s;e animals, not only in di&s;tingui&s;hing par|ticularly tho&s;e who make war again&s;t them, but, when attacked, in defending them&s;elves and providing for their own &s;afety. When we approached, they all a&s;&s;embled together, uttered loud and frightful cries, and threw at us dried branches which they broke off from the trees. Some of them voided their excre|ments in their hands, and threw them at our heads. I likewi&s;e remarked, that they never abandoned one another; that they leapt from tree to tree with incredible agility; and that they flung them&s;elves headlong from branch to branch, without ever falling to the ground; becau&s;e, before reaching the earth, they always caught hold of a branch either with their hands or tail; &s;o that, if not &s;hot dead at once, they could not be laid hold of; for, even when mortally wounded, they remain fixed to the trees, where they often die, and fall not till they are corrupted. More than four days af|ter death, I have &s;een them firmly fixed to the trees; and fifteen or &s;ixteen of them are fre|quently <PB N="181" REF="212"> &s;hot before three or four of them can be obtained. What is &s;ingular, as &s;oon as one is wounded, the re&s;t collect about him, and put their fingers into the wound, as if they meant to &s;ound it; and, when much blood is di&s;charged, &s;ome of them keep the wound &s;hut, while others make a ma&s;h of leaves, and dexte|rou&s;ly &s;top up the aperture. This operation I have often ob&s;erved with much admiration. The females bring forth but one young, which they carry in the &s;ame manner as the Negre&s;&s;es do their children. The young monkey em|braces its mother's neck with the two fore-feet, and with the two hind it lays hold of the mid|dle of her back. When &s;he wants to give it &s;uck, &s;he takes it in her paws, and pre&s;ents the brea&s;t to it, like a woman. . . . There is no o|ther method of obtaining the young but by killing the mother; for &s;he never abandons it. When &s;he is killed, it falls from her, and may then be &s;eized. When the&s;e animals are em|barra&s;&s;ed, they a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in pa&s;&s;ing a brook, or from one tree to another. . . . Their cries are heard at the di&s;tance of more than a league<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Aventuriers, par Oxemelin, tom. 2. p. 251.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e facts are confirmed by Dam|pier <PB N="182" REF="213">
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The monkey's found in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Campeachy, are the uglie&s;t I ever &s;aw. They are much bigger than a hare, and have great tails, about two feet and a half long. The under &s;ide of their tails is all bare, with a black hard &s;kin; but the upper &s;ide, and all the body, is co|vered with coar&s;e, long, black, &s;taring hair. The&s;e creatures keep together 20 or 30 in a company, and ramble over the woods, leaping from tree to tree. If they meet with a &s;ingle per&s;on, they will threaten to devour him. When I have been alone, I have been afraid to &s;hoot them, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t time I met them. They were a great company dancing from tree to tree, over my head, chattering and making a terrible noi&s;e, and a great many grim faces, and &s;hewing antick ge|&s;tures. Some broke down dry &s;ticks and threw at me; others &s;cattered their urine and dung about my ears; at la&s;t, one bigger than the re&s;t, came to a &s;mall limb ju&s;t over my head, and leaping directly at me, made me &s;tart back; but the monkey caught hold of the bough with the tip of his tail, and there continued &s;winging to and fro, and making mouths at me.&mdash;At la&s;t I pa&s;t on, they &s;till keeping me company, with the like menacing po&s;tures, till I came to our huts. The tails of the&s;e monkeys are as good to them as one of their hands; and they will hold as fa&s;t by them. If two or more of us were together, they would ha&s;ten from us. The females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the males; for they have commonly two: One &s;he carries under one of her arms; the other &s;its on her back, and cla&s;ps her two fore-paws about its neck. The&s;e monkeys are the mo&s;t &s;ullen I ever met with, for all the art we could u&s;e would ne|ver tame them. It is a hard matter to &s;hoot one of them, &s;o as to take it, for if it gets hold with its claws or tail, it will not fall as long as one breath of life remains. After I have &s;hot at one and broke a leg or an arm, I have pitied the poor creatures to &s;ee it look and handle the wounded limb, and turn it about from &s;ide to &s;ide. The&s;e monkeys are very rare|ly, or (as &s;ome &s;ay) never on the ground; <HI>Dampier, vol.</HI> 2. <HI>part</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 60.</NOTE>: He a&s;&s;ures us, however, that the females generally produce two young, one of which the <PB N="183" REF="214"> mother carries between her arms, and the other on her back.

<P>NEXT to the ouarine and alouate, the co|aita is the large&s;t of the &s;apajous. I &s;aw one of them at the palace of the Duke of Bouil|lon, <PB N="185" REF="216"> where, by its familiarity, and even its ca|re&s;&s;es, it procured the affection of tho&s;e who had the charge of it. But, notwith&s;tanding all the care and attention it received, it was unable to re&s;i&s;t the cold of the winter 1764. It died, to the regret of its ma&s;ter, who was &s;o obliging as to &s;end it to me, to be placed in the Royal Cabinet. I &s;aw another in the hou&s;e of the Marquis de Montmirail. This was a male, and the former a female. Both were equally trac|table and well tamed. Hence this &s;apajou, by its mild and docile di&s;po&s;ition, differs much from the ouarine and alouate, who are &s;o wild that no art can tame them. Neither has it, like them, an o&s;&s;eous pouch in the throat. Like the oua|rine, its hair is black, but rough. The coaita likewi&s;e differs from all the other &s;apajous, by having only four fingers on his hands. By this character and his prehen&s;ile tail, he is ea&s;ily di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the monkeys, who have all five fingers, and a flaccid tail.</P>
<P>The animal called <HI>exquima</HI> by Marcgrave, is a &s;pecies very nearly allied to the <HI>coaita,</HI> and is perhaps only a variety of it. This author &s;eems to have been deceived when he tells us, that the exquima is a native of Guiney and Congo. The figure he has given of it was alone &s;ufficient to have convinced him of his error; for it repre|&s;ents this animal with a tail rolled up at the point, a character which belongs exclu&s;ively to the &s;a|pajous. Of cour&s;e, Marcgrave's exquima is not <PB N="186" REF="217"> a monkey of Guiney, but a &s;apajou with a pre|hen&s;ile tail, which had been tran&s;ported thither from Bra&s;il. The name <HI>exquima,</HI> or <HI>quima,</HI> by ab&s;tracting the article <HI>ex,</HI> and which ought to be pronounced <HI>quoima,</HI> is not very different from
<HI>quoaita,</HI> the manner in which &s;everal authors &s;pell the name <HI>coaita,</HI> Hence every circum|&s;tance concurs in e&s;tabli&s;hing Marcgrave's <HI>exqui|ma,</HI> which he calls a Guiney monkey, to be a Bra&s;ilian <HI>&s;apajou,</HI> and a variety only of the co|aita, which it re&s;embles in di&s;po&s;itions, &s;ize, co|lour, and the prehen&s;ile tail. The mo&s;t remark|able difference is, that the exquima has whiti&s;h hair on the belly, and a white beard, two inches long, under the chin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cercopithecus barbatus Guineen&s;is; in Congo vocatur <HI>Exquima,</HI> pilos habet &s;u&s;cos, &s;ed per totum dor&s;um qua&s;i adu|&s;tos &s;eu ferrugineos; fu&s;cis autem punctulatim in&s;per&s;us color albus: venter albicat er mentum inferius; barbam quoque e|gregie albam habet, con&s;tantem capillis duos digitos longis et amplius pa&s;&s;is qua&s;i ordinatim pexa fui&s;&s;et; quando haec &s;pecies ira&s;citur, os ample diducendo et mandibulas celeriter movendo exagitat hominem; egregie &s;altant, varios fructus comedunt; <HI>Maregr.

But the&s;e differences &s;eem not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for we learn from the evidence of travellers, that &s;ome coaitas are black and others white, and &s;ome have beards and others no beards: 'There are,' &s;ays Dampier, 'great droves of monkeys, &s;ome of them white, but mo&s;t of them black; &s;ome have beards, others <PB N="187" REF="218"> are beardle&s;s. They are of a middle &s;ize, yet extraordinary fat at the dry &s;ea&s;on, when the fruits are ripe; and they are very good meat, for we ate of them very plentifully. The In|dians were &s;hy of eating them for a while; but they &s;oon were per&s;uaded to it, by &s;eeing us feed on them &s;o heartily. In the rainy &s;ea|&s;on they have worms in their bowels. I have taken a handful of them out of one monkey we cut open; and &s;ome of them &s;even or eight feet long. They are a very waggi&s;h kind of monkey, and played a thou&s;and antick tricks as we marched at any time through the woods, &s;kipping from bough to bough, with the young ones hanging at the old ones backs, making faces at us, chattering, and, if they had oppor|tunity, pi&s;&s;ing down purpo&s;ely on our heads. To pa&s;s from top to top of high trees, who&s;e branches are a little too far a&s;under for their leaping, they will &s;ometimes hang down by one another's tails in a chain; and &s;winging in that manner, the lowermo&s;t catches hold of a bough of the other tree, and draws up the re&s;t of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dampier's voyages, vol. 3. p. 330.</NOTE>.' All the&s;e facts, even the worms in the inte&s;tines, corre&s;pond with our coaitas. M. Daubenton, in di&s;&s;ecting the&s;e animals, found a great number of worms, &s;ome of which were from twelve to thirteen inches long. It is obvi|ous, therefore, that the exquima of Marcgrave is <PB N="188" REF="219"> a &s;apajou of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or, at lea&s;t, of a &s;pecies very nearly allied to that of the coaita.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t likewi&s;e remark, that, if the animal mentioned by Linnaeus, under the name of

<P>Independent of this variety, the characters of which are con&s;picuous, there are other varieties, though le&s;s remarkable, in the &s;pecies of the co|aita. That de&s;cribed by M.

But tho&s;e I have &s;een were entirely black, and had very few hairs on the inferior parts of the body, where the &s;kin appeared, and was equally black with the hair. Of the two coaitas men|tioned by Mr Edwards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gleanings, p. 222.</NOTE>, the one was black and <PB N="189" REF="220"> the other brown. On account of the length and &s;lenderne&s;s of their legs and tail, they were called
<HI>&s;pider monkeys.</HI></P>
<P>Some years ago, a coaita was &s;ent me, under the denomination of <HI>chamek,</HI> which, I was told, came from the coa&s;t of Peru. I &s;hall give a de|&s;cription of it in the margin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal was brought from the coa&s;t of Bancet in Peru, when thirteen months old. It weighed about &s;ix pounds. The whole body was black. The &s;kin of the face was naked, of a coar&s;e grain, and of the colour of a Mulatto. The hair was coar&s;e, and from two to three inches in length. The ears, which re&s;embled tho&s;e of man, were naked, and of the &s;ame colour with the face. The tail was one foot ten inches long, five inches thick at the ba&s;e, and about one inch at the point. It was round, and garni&s;hed with hair above and be|low about thirteen inches from the origin, but naked below nine inches from the extremity, where the under part of it is flat and furrowed in the middle, and round above. This a|nimal &s;u&s;pends it&s;elf by the tail, and likewi&s;e u&s;es it as a fifth hand to lay hold of any thing it wants.

The hair on its body was of a beautiful &s;ilvery white colour; and that on its tail was a &s;hining che&s;nut approaching to black. Its ears, cheeks, and muzzle, were of &s;o lively a vermilion co|lour, that it had the appearance of being the work of art. I kept it for twelve months; and, now that I am in &s;ight of the French coa&s;t, it is &s;till alive. But, notwith&s;tanding all my precautions to defend it again&s;t the cold, it fell a victim to the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on be|fore my arrival. . . . I have pre&s;erved it in aquavitae, which will be &s;ufficient to &s;how that <PB N="215" REF="260"> my de&s;cription is not exaggerated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage &s;ur la rivi&egrave;re des Amazones, par M. de la Con|damine, p. 165.</NOTE>.' From this narration it is obvious, that M. de la Con|damine's de&s;cription will apply to no other ani|mal than the <HI>Mico</HI>; and that it is a di&s;tinct, and probably a very rare &s;pecies.

<P>The mico has neither cheek-pouches nor cal|lo&s;ities on-the buttocks. The tail is about one half longer than the head and body, and is not prehen&s;ile. The partition of the no&s;trils is thin|ner than that of the other &s;agoins; but their a|pertures are placed at a &s;ide. Its face and ears are naked, and of a vermilion colour.

<P>THE white bear is a famous animal in our mo&s;t northern regions. It is mentioned by Marten, and &s;ome other voyagers. But none <PB REF="262" MS="y">

</FIGURE> <PB N="217" REF="263"> of their de&s;criptions are &s;o complete as to enable us to a&s;certain whether it differs in &s;pecies from the common bear. If what they have &s;aid, how|ever, be exact, it is probably a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. But, as we know that the wolf varies in differ|ent climates, &s;ome of them being black, others brown, others white, and others variegated, co|lour is a character of no value in con&s;tituting different &s;pecies. I &s;aw two &s;mall bears which had been brought from Ru&s;&s;ia, and were entire|ly white<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We find white land-bears not only in Ru&s;&s;ia, but in Po|land, Siberia, and Tartary. The mountains of Great Tar|tary furni&s;h great numbers of white bears; <HI>Relat. de Grande Tartarie, p.</HI> 8. The&s;e mountain bears do not frequent the &s;ea, and yet they are white. This colour, therefore, &s;eems rather to proceed from the difference of climate than from that of the element inhabited by the&s;e animals.</NOTE>; and yet they were unque&s;tionably of the &s;ame &s;pecies with our Alpine bears. The&s;e animals likewi&s;e vary greatly in &s;ize. As they live long, and become very thick and fat in places where they have plenty of nouri&s;hment, and are not di&s;turbed, the character drawn from magnitude is equivocal. Hence we are not au|thori&s;ed to conclude, that the bear of the nor|thern &s;eas is a peculiar &s;pecies, &s;olely becau&s;e he <PB N="218" REF="264"> is white and larger than the common kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ur&s;us in Polonia variat, maximus nigricans, minor ful|vus, minimus argentinus, in confiniis Mo&s;choviae pilis nigris et argentei coloris mixti . . . ex Ur&s;o occi&s;o pellis detracta fere ad ulnas &s;ex protendebatur in terra <HI>Chelmen&s;i,</HI> altera in Palatinatu <HI>Braclavien&s;i,</HI> tertia ad ulnas quinque in <HI>Bondargout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> pago Palatinatus Pomeraniae . . . . non raro ex Lithuania advehuntur Gedanum pelles octo pedum; <HI>Rzaczin&s;ki, p.</HI> 322.&mdash;<HI>Nota.</HI> This pa&s;&s;age proves that there are white land-bears as large as tho&s;e of the Northern &s;eas.</NOTE>, The difference of habits &s;eems not to be more deci&s;ive than that of colour and magnitude. The bear of the northern &s;eas feeds upon fi&s;hes. He never quits the margins of the &s;ea, and often in|habits the floating i&s;lands of ice. But, if we con&s;ider that the bear is an animal which eats every thing, that, when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, he has no choice, and that he is not afraid of wa|ter, the&s;e habits will not appear &s;ufficient to form di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The fi&s;h eaten by the &s;ea-bears is rather a kind of fle&s;h, being chiefly the car|ca&s;&s;es of whales, walru&s;es, and &s;eals. The cli|mate produces no other animals. Neither does it afford grains or fruits; and, con&s;equently, the bear is under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the productions of the &s;ea. Is it not probable that our bears, if tran&s;ported to the mountains of Spitzbergen, and finding no food upon land, would take to the &s;ea in que&s;t of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence?</P>
<P>Colour, &s;ize, and mode of living, being in&s;uf|ficient, no other e&s;&s;ential characters remain but tho&s;e which may be derived from figure. Now <PB N="219" REF="265"> all that voyagers have &s;aid of the &s;ea-bear, a|mounts only to this, that his head, body, and hair are longer than tho&s;e of our bear, and that his &s;kull is much harder. If the&s;e differences were real and con&s;iderable, they would be &s;uffi|cient to con&s;titute another &s;pecies. But I am not certain that Marten has examined with ac|curacy, and that the other writers who copied him, have not exaggerated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on's hi&s;t. of Greenland; and Ellis Voy. to Hud|&s;on's Bay.</NOTE>. 'The&s;e white bears,' he remarks, 'are quite otherwi&s;e &s;haped than tho&s;e that are &s;een in our country; they have a long head like unto a dog, and a long neck, and they bark like dogs that are hoar&s;e, and all their whole body is much otherwi&s;e &s;haped than ours. They are &s;lenderer in the body, and a great deal &s;wifter;' <HI>Marten's voy|age to Spitzbergen, p.</HI> 100. This de&s;cription furni&s;hes the following remarks: 1. That the author does not make the&s;e bears larger than ours; and, con&s;equently, that we ought to &s;u|&s;pect the evidence of tho&s;e who tell us that the &s;ea-bear is &s;ometimes thirteen feet in length<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A white bear, which had been killed, was brought aboard. Its &s;kin was thirteen feet long; <HI>Troi&s;i&egrave;me voyage des Hollandois par le Nord, p.</HI> 35.</NOTE>. 2. That hair as &s;oft as wool is not a &s;pecific cha|racter; for, to render hair &s;oft, and even more bu&s;hy, it is only nece&s;&s;ary that an animal be frequently in the water, as appears from the land <PB N="220" REF="266"> and water beavers. The latter, who dwelt of|tener in the water than on land, have coar&s;er and le&s;s bu&s;hy hair: And, I am inclined to think, that the other differences are neither real nor &s;o con&s;picuous as Marten would have us to believe; for Dithmar Blefken, in his de&s;cription of Ice|land, mentions the&s;e bears, and a&s;&s;ures us that he &s;aw one killed in Greenland, which rai&s;ed it&s;elf on the two hind feet, like our bears; but he &s;ays not one word which indicates that the white bear of Greenland is not entirely &s;imilar to ours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habet I&s;landia coloris albi ingentes Ur&s;os . . . in Groen|landia ur&s;um magnum et album habuimus obviam, qui neque nos timebat neque no&s;tro clamore abigi poterat, verum recta ad nos tanquam ad certam praedam contendebat, cumque proprius nos acce&s;&s;i&s;&s;et, is bonbarda trajectus, ibi demum erec|tus, po&s;terioribus pedibus tanquam homo &s;tabat donec tertio trajiceretur, atque ita exanimatus concidit; <HI>Dithmar Blefken. p.</HI> 64.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, when the&s;e animals find prey on land, they never go to &s;ea in que&s;t of food. They devour rain-deer, and &s;uch other animals as they can &s;eize. They even attack men, and never fail to dig up dead bodies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The white bears live upon dead whales, and, in the neigh|bourhood of the&s;e carca&s;&s;es, they are mo&s;t frequently found. They likewi&s;e devour men, when they can &s;urpri&s;e them. If they &s;cent the place where a dead body is interred, they re|move the earth and &s;tones, open the coffin, and eat the carca&s;s; <HI>Recueil des voyages du Nord, tom.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 126.</NOTE>. But hunger, which they often feel in the&s;e de|&s;ert and barren lands, obliges them to frequent the water, in que&s;t of &s;eals, young walru&s;es, and <PB N="221" REF="267"> whales. They take up their re&s;idence on i&s;lands of ice, on which they are often &s;een floating at a di&s;tance, and never abandon their &s;tation as long as they can find abundance of food. When the&s;e boards of ice are detached in the &s;pring, the bears allow them&s;elves to be carried along; and, as they cannot regain the land, or abandon the ice on which they are embarked, they often peri&s;h in the open &s;ea. Tho&s;e who arrive with the ice on the coa&s;ts of Iceland or Norway<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the i&s;lands of ice &s;eparate from the North of Greenland, and are driven &s;outhward, the white bears dare not depart from them. When they arrive in Norway, or at any i&s;land, they are mad with hunger; and &s;trange &s;tories are told of the ravages made by the&s;e animals; <HI>Recueil des voyages du Nord, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 100.</NOTE>, are &s;tarved to &s;uch a degree, that they devour every thing they meet, which may have given ri&s;e to the prejudice, that the&s;e &s;ea-bears are more fierce and voracious than the common kind. Some authors tell us, that the &s;ea-bears are amphibious like the &s;eals, and that they can live as long as they plea&s;e under water. But the contrary is evident from the manner of hunt|ing them: They are incapable of &s;wimming long, and never accompli&s;h above a league at a time. They are followed by a &s;mall boat, and are &s;oon worn out with fatigue. If they could di&s;pen&s;e with re&s;piration, they would dive to the bottom, in order to re&s;t them&s;elves. But, when they dive, it is only for a few &s;econds; and, for <PB N="222" REF="268"> fear of drowning, they allow them&s;elves to be killed on the &s;urface of the water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This white bear &s;wam about a mile.

<P>I here give a figure of the white &s;ea bear, from a drawing &s;ent me by the late Mr Colin&s;on. If this drawing be exact, it is certain that the &s;ea bear is a different &s;pecies from the land bear.

From the drawing it like|wi&s;e appears, that the feet, in&s;tead of re&s;embling the human hand, like tho&s;e of the land bear, are formed nearly like the feet of a large dog, and other carnivorous animals of this kind. Be&s;ides, from &s;everal relations, it appears, that &s;ome of the&s;e bears are much larger than the land bear. <PB REF="270">

<P>M. GMELIN, in the New Memoirs of the Academy of Peter&s;burg, has given a de&s;cription of a Tartarian cow, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, appears to differ from all tho&s;e we have enumerated un|der the article <HI>buffalo.</HI> 

<Q>'This cow,' &s;ays he, 'which I &s;aw alive, and had a drawing made of it is Siberia, came from Calmuck. It was about two and a half Ru&s;&s;ian ells in length. <PB N="226" REF="277"> By this &s;tandard we may judge of its other dimen&s;ions, the proportions of which have been accurately ob&s;erved by the painter. The body re&s;embles that of a common cow. The horns are bended inward. The hair on the body and head is back, except on the front and ridge of the back, where it is white. It has a mane on the neck; and the whole body, like that of a buck, is covered with very long hair, which de&s;cends as far as the knees, and makes the legs appear &s;hort. It has a bunch on the back. The tail re&s;embles that of a hor&s;e, and is white and very bu&s;hy. The fore legs are black, the hind ones white, and the whole re&s;emble tho&s;e of the ox. Upon the heels of the hind feet, there are two tufts of long hair, the one before and the other behind; and, on the fore feet, there is but one tuft placed behind. The excrements are more &s;olid than tho&s;e of cows; and, when the animal di&s;charges urine, it draws its body backward. It lows not like an ox, but grunts like a hog. It is wild, and even ferocious; for, except the man from whom it receives its food, it gives blows with its head to every per&s;on who comes near it. It hardly &s;uffers the pre&s;ence of do|me&s;tic cows: Whenever it perceives one of them, it grunts, which it &s;eldom does on any other occa&s;ion.' To this de&s;cription M. Gmelin adds, 'That it is the &s;ame animal mentioned by Rubruquis in his travels into Tartary: <PB N="227" REF="278"> That there are two &s;pecies of it among the Calmucks, the fir&s;t called <HI>Sarluk,</HI> which I have already de&s;cribed, and the &s;econd <HI>Chainuk,</HI> which differs from the other by the largene&s;s of its head and horns, and al&s;o by the tail, which at its origin re&s;embles that of the hor&s;e, and terminates like that of a cow. But they both have the &s;ame natural di&s;po&s;itions.'</Q></P>
<P>In the whole of this de&s;cription, there is only a &s;ingle character which indicates the Calmuck cows to be a particular &s;pecies, and that is their grunting in&s;tead of a lowing. It every other ar|ticle, they have &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the bi&s;on, that they mu&s;t belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, or rathe the &s;ame race. Be&s;ides, though the author &s;ays, that the&s;e cows do not low, but grunt, he acknowledges that they very rarely utter that kind of &s;ound. Perhaps it was an af|fection peculiar to the individual he &s;aw; for Rubruquis, and the other writers whom he quotes, mention not this grunting. Perhaps the bi&s;ons, when enraged, likewi&s;e make a grunting noi&s;e. Even our bulls, particularly in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, have a hollow, interrupted voice, which has a greater re&s;emblance to grunting than to lowing. I am per&s;uaded, therefore, that this grunting cow of Gmelin is nothing el&s;e but the bi&s;on, and does not con&s;titute a particular &s;pecies.</P>

<P>IN Ca&s;an, and the provinces watered by the Wolga, as far as Au&s;tria, there is a &s;mall animal <PB N="235" REF="286"> called <HI>&s;ou&s;lik</HI> in the Ru&s;&s;ian language, which fur|ni&s;hes a beautiful fur. In figure and &s;hort|ne&s;s of tail, it has a great re&s;emblance to the &s;hort-tailed field mou&s;e. But it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mou&s;e or rat kind by its fur, which is every where inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;mall &s;pots of a bright and &s;hining white. The&s;e &s;pots exceed not a line in diameter, and are placed at the di&s;tance of two or three lines from each other. They are more con&s;picuous and better defined upon the loins than on the &s;houlders and head. Mr Pennant, a well known and very able Natu|rali&s;t, favoured me with one of the&s;e &s;ou&s;liks, which had been tran&s;mitted to him from Au&s;tria, as an animal unknown to the Naturali&s;ts.

The&s;e eight animals arrived in Peter&s;burg, after a long journey from Siberia. But, notwith&s;tanding all the attention paid to them, they died in pa&s;&s;ing from Peter&s;|burg to France. The in&s;tructions from Siberia were, to feed them only with grain or hemp|&s;eed; to give them as much air as po&s;&s;ible; to put a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;and in their cage, becau&s;e, in their natural &s;tate, they burrow in light &s;oils.</P>

In the&s;e holes they make diffe|rent apartments, and ama&s;s in them their winter provi&s;ions during the &s;ummer.

<P>IN the neighbourhood of Cape Verd, there is another hog or boar, which, from the number <PB N="242" REF="294"> of his teeth, and the enormous &s;ize of the tu&s;ks in his upper-jaw, appears to be a peculiar race, if not a different &s;pecies from that of all the o|ther hogs, and approaches toward the babirou&s;&s;a. The&s;e tu&s;ks have a greater re&s;emblance to ivory horns than to teeth. They are half a foot long, five inches in circumference at the ba&s;e, and bended nearly like the horns of a bull. This character alone is not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a difference in &s;pecies. But, what &s;upports this pre&s;umption, he likewi&s;e differs from all other hogs in the length of the aperture of his no&s;trils, in the great breadth and figure of his jaws, and in the number and form of his grinders. How|ever, we have &s;een the tu&s;ks of a wild boar, which was killed in the woods of Burgundy, and made an approach to the Cape Verd boar: Its tu&s;ks were about three inches and a half long, and four inches in circumference at the ba&s;e. They had al&s;o a double bend, like the horns of a bull. They appeared likewi&s;e to con&s;i&s;t of &s;olid ivory; and, it is certain, that this boar mu&s;t have had larger jaws than the common kind. <PB N="243" REF="295"> Hence we may pre&s;ume, that the Cape Verd boar is only a &s;imple variety, a particular race, in the &s;pecies of the common hog.</P>

<P>We formerly &s;ugge&s;ted, that the wild boar of Cape Verd appeared to be a different race, and perhaps a different &s;pecies from all the other hogs. The celebrated M. Allamand, profe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory at Leyden, was kind enough to &s;end us an engraving of this animal, and af|terwards wrote M. Daubenton in the follow|ing terms:</P>
<Q>I believe, Sir, that the wild boar repre&s;ent|ed in the plate which I &s;ent you, is the &s;ame with that pointed out by you under the deno|mination of the <HI>Wild Boar of Cape Verd.</HI> This animal is &s;till living (May 5. 1767) in the me|nagerie of the Prince of Orange. I vi&s;it him occa&s;ionally, and always with fre&s;h plea&s;ure. I cannot help admiring the &s;ingular form of his head. I have written to the Governour of the Cape of Good Hope, begging him, if po&s;|&s;ible, to tran&s;mit me another. But of this I have little hope; becau&s;e, even at the Cape, it was regarded as a mon&s;ter, which had never hitherto been &s;een by any per&s;on. If, how|ever, I &s;ucceed in my reque&s;t, I &s;hall &s;end the animal to France, that you and M. de Buffon <PB N="244" REF="296"> may have an opportunity of examining it. We tried to make the one in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion copulate with a &s;ow; but, as &s;oon as &s;he was pre&s;ented to him, he darted upon her with fury, and tore her to pieces.</Q>
<P>We have copied the engraving tran&s;mitted to us by M. Allamand. M. Pallas, and M. Vo&s;|ma&euml;r have u&s;ed the &s;ame figure, and each of them have given a de&s;cription of this animal. M. Allamand, in his letter to M. Daubenton, dated at Leyden, October 31. 1766, remarks, that the head is the mo&s;t &s;ingular part of this boar, which chiefly differs from that of our hogs by two un|common appendixes, in the form of ears, at the &s;ide of each eye.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here remark, that the di&s;dain and cruelty, mentioned by M. Allamand, of this wild boar to the &s;ow when in &s;ea&s;on, &s;eems to prove it to be a different &s;pecies from our hogs. A farther proof ari&s;es from the difference in the form of the head, both external and internal. However, as it approaches the hog much near|er than any other animal, and as it is found not only in the neighbourhood of Cape Verd, but not very di&s;tant from the Cape of Good Hope, we &s;hall call it the <HI>African boar,</HI> and give the hi&s;tory and de&s;cription of it from the writings of Pallas and Vo&s;ma&euml;r.</P>
<P>Vo&s;ma&euml;r calls it the <HI>wild African boar,</HI> or the
<HI>boar with a large &s;nout,</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hes it, with propriety, from the Guiney hog with long <PB N="245" REF="297"> pointed ears, from the American pecari, and from the Indian babirou&s;&s;a.</P>
<Q>'M. de Buffon,' he remarks, '&s;peaking of a part of the jaws, the tail and feet of a &s;ingular wild boar of Cape Verd, pre&s;erved in the royal cabinet, &s;ays, that it has cutting teeth: But no &s;uch teeth appear in our &s;ubject.'</Q>
<P>Hence M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r in&s;inuates, that it is not the &s;ame animal. We have &s;een, however, that M. Allamand and I agree, that this Cape de Verd boar, of which I have had an opportunity of ex|amining a part of the head only, is found, not|with&s;tanding, to be the &s;ame large &s;nouted hog which M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r &s;aid was unknown to all the naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>M. Tulbagh, Governour of the Cape of Good Hope, who tran&s;mitted this wild boar to Europe, writes, that it was taken between Caffraria and the country of the great Namaquas, about two hundred leagues from the Cape, and that it was the only one of the &s;pecies which had been there &s;een alive. M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r likewi&s;e received the &s;kin of an animal of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which ap|peared to differ in &s;ome particulars, from the live animal.</P>
<P>This animal was kept in a cage; 
<Q><P>and, as I was informed,' M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r remarks, 'that he was not mi&s;chievous, I opened the door of his cage. He came out, without &s;howing any marks of rage. He gaily fri&s;ked about in que&s;t of food, and greedily devoured whatever was given him. <PB N="246" REF="298"> Having left him alone for a few moments, I found him, on my return, bu&s;y in digging the earth, where, notwith&s;tanding the pavement was made of &s;mall bricks well cemented, he had already made a hole of an incredible &s;ize, with a view, as we afterwards di&s;covered, to reach a common &s;ewer which pa&s;&s;ed below at a great depth. I cau&s;ed his labour to be inter|rupted; and it was not without much trouble, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal men, that we could overcome his re&s;i&s;tance, and make him return to his cage. His re&s;entment was expre&s;&s;ed by &s;harp and mournful cries. He &s;eems to have been taken in the African woods when he was very young; for he has grown con&s;iderably &s;ince his arrival in Europe, and is &s;till alive
(1767). He pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t winter very well, though the fro&s;t was &s;evere, and he was con|fined during the greate&s;t part of that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In agility, he exceeds the hogs of this coun|try. He freely allows him&s;elf to be &s;troaked with the hand, and even with a &s;tick. He &s;eems to be plea&s;ed with rough friction; for it was by this means that we made him remain quiet when the painter drew his picture. When provoked or rudely pu&s;hed, he retires back|ward, always facing the a&s;&s;ailant, and &s;haking or &s;triking forcibly with his head. When let loo&s;e after long confinement, he is very gay, leaps, and pur&s;ues fallow-deer, and other ani|mals. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, he erects his tail, <PB N="247" REF="299"> which is commonly pendulous. He emits a &s;trong odour, which is not di&s;agreeable; but I cannot compare it to any other &s;mell. When I &s;troaked him with the hand, this odour ap|proached to that of new chee&s;e. He eats all kinds of grains. His food, when on &s;hip-board, was maize, and as much fre&s;h herbage as could be procured. But, after he had ta&s;ted barely and European wheat, with which other animals in our menagerie are fed, he preferred this kind of food, and roots dug out of the earth. He was &s;o fond of rye-bread, that he followed any per&s;on who had a piece of it. When he eats or drinks, he &s;upports him&s;elf on the knees of his fore feet; and he often re&s;ts in this po&s;ition. His &s;en&s;es of hearing and &s;melling are very acute; but his &s;ight is limited by the &s;mallne&s;s and &s;ituation of his eyes, which prevent his &s;eeing objects around him, becau&s;e they are placed higher and nearer each other than in other hogs, and there are two large excre&s;cences at the &s;ides and below the eyes. He has more &s;agacity than the common hog.</P>
<P>The figure of the head is terrible. The flatne&s;s and breadth of the no&s;e, joined to the length of the &s;nout, the &s;ingular excre&s;cences ri&s;ing from the &s;ides of the eyes, and the &s;trong tu&s;ks, give to the animal a mon&s;trous a&s;pect. The length of the body is about four Rheni&s;h feet.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="300">The figure of the body makes a near ap|proach to that of the dome&s;tic hog: He ap|pears to be &s;maller, hsi back being flatter, and his legs &s;horter.</P>
<P>When compared with other hogs, his head is deformed both in figure and dimen&s;ions. The muzzle is large, flat, and very hard. The no&s;e is moveable, a little bended laterally toward the ba&s;e, and terminates obliquely. The no&s;trils are large, di&s;tant from each other, and appear only when the head is rai&s;ed. The upper lip is hard, and thick at the &s;ide. Round the tu&s;ks it is prominent and pendulous, forming behind them a kind of oval cartilaginous protuberance, which covers the corners of the muzzle.</P>
<P>This animal wants fore teeth both above and below but the gums are &s;mooth, rounded, and hard.</P>
<P>The tu&s;ks of the upper jaw are an inch thick at the ba&s;e, crooked, and project out of the mouth five inches and a half, and terminate in an obtu&s;e point. On the &s;ide of each of them there is a kind of furrow. Tho&s;e of the un|der jaw are much &s;maller, le&s;s crooked, and almo&s;t triangular. By continual friction a|gain&s;t the upper tu&s;ks, they appear to be cut obliquely. We were prevented from exami|ning the grinders by the furious re&s;i&s;tance of the animal.</P>
<P>In proportion to the head, the eyes are &s;mall, placed higher, and nearer each other and the' <PB N="249" REF="301"> ears, than in the common hog. The iris is of a deep brown colour, and the cornea white. The upper eye-lids are garni&s;hed with brown, &s;tiff, erect, and very clo&s;e ciliae, which are longer in the middle than at the two &s;ides. There are no ciliae on the under eye-lids.</P>
<P>The ears are pretty large, more round than pointed, covered in the in&s;ide with clo&s;e yel|low hair, and bend back toward the animal's body. Under the eyes there is a kind of bul|bous or glandular fac; and immediately be|low that, appear two round, flat, thick, and horizontal excre&s;cences, about two inches and a quarter in diameter. . . . . . In a &s;traight line between the&s;e excre&s;cences and the muz|zle, there is, on each &s;ide of the head, a hard, round, &s;harp protuberance.</P>
<P>The &s;kin &s;eems to be very thick, filled with lard in the ordinary places, but flaccid on the neck, groin, and dewlap. In &s;ome places it appears to be &s;lightly furrowed, unequal, and as if the upper part of it fell off by intervals. Thinly di&s;per&s;ed over the body are &s;ome tufts of hairs, con&s;i&s;ting of three, four, or five, long|er and &s;horter, and placed in a &s;traight line near one another. The front, and between the ears, &s;eem to be wrinkled, and are adorned with very clo&s;e, white, and brown hairs. From thence, toward the ba&s;e of the muzzle, de|&s;cends a narrow band of black and gray hairs, which, &s;eparating in the middle, fall upon each <PB N="250" REF="302"> &s;ide of the head. On the nap of the neck, and the anterior part of the back, the bri&s;tles are the longe&s;t and mo&s;t clo&s;e: Their colour is a du&s;ky brown and gray. Some of them are &s;even or eight inches long: In thickne&s;s they exceed not tho&s;e of the common hog, and they &s;plit in the &s;ame manner. The&s;e bri&s;tles are not &s;traight, but &s;lightly inclined. Upon the back, their number is &s;o &s;mall, that the &s;kin appears to be naked. The flanks, brea&s;t, belly, &s;ides of the head and neck, are garni&s;h|ed with &s;mall white bri&s;tles.</P>
<P>The feet, like tho&s;e of our hogs, are divi|ded into two black, pointed hoofs. The tail is naked, hangs perpendicularly, and terminates almo&s;t in a point.</P>
<P>The colour of the head is blacki&s;h; but that of the back and belly is a bright reddi&s;h gray.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e differences pointed out by M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, and the repugnance which this boar di&s;covered to the &s;ow that was pre&s;ented to it, I am uncertain whether it is not a variety only of our European hog. This &s;pecies varies greatly in A&s;ia, Siam, and China. My uncer|tainty is increa&s;ed by having found, about thir|ty years ago, an enormous head of a wild boar that was killed in my own woods, the tu&s;ks of which were nearly as large as tho&s;e of the Cape boar.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="303"> Be&s;ides, M. Comer&s;on informs me, that there are wild boars in Madaga&s;car, who&s;e head, from the ears to the eyes, is of the ordinary form; but that below the eyes is a protuberance which gradually tapers to the end of the &s;nout, &s;o that the animal appears to have two heads, the half of the one &s;unk into the other. The fle&s;h of this hog is &s;limy and in&s;ipid. This information made me &s;u&s;pect, that the animal I had fir&s;t mentioned under the denomination of the <HI>Wild Boar of Cape Verd,</HI> becau&s;e its head was brought from the neighbourhood of that Cape, and af|terwards called it the <HI>Wild African Boar,</HI> becau&s;e it exi&s;ts in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, is likewi&s;e found in the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY><DIV1 TYPE="addendum">
<HEAD>Addition by Profe&s;&s;or Allamand.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Buffon, in his hi&s;tory of the hog, has &s;hown, that the hog eludes all tho&s;e methodical di&s;tributions into cla&s;&s;es and genera, the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characters of which are derived from particular parts of the body. Though his rea|&s;ons are not to be an&s;wered, they would have acquired additional force, if he had been ac|quainted with the animal under con&s;ideration. It is a wild boar &s;ent from the Cape of Good <PB N="252" REF="304"> Hope, in the year 1765, to the menagerie of the Prince of Orange, which has hitherto been unknown to the Naturali&s;ts. Be&s;ide the many &s;ingularities which make the European hog a detached &s;pecies, this animal exhibits fre&s;h ano|malies, which di&s;tingui&s;h him from all the other varieties of the &s;ame genus; for the figure of his head is not only different, but he has no cut|ting teeth, from which mo&s;t of our Nomencla|tors have drawn their di&s;tinctive characters, though the number of the teeth is by no means uniform, even in our dome&s;tic hogs.</P>
<P>To M. Tulbagh, Governour of the Cape of Good Hope, who mi&s;&s;es no opportunity of tran&s;|mitting to Europe the curious productions of that country, we are indebted for this wild boar. In his letter, he remarks, that this animal was taken about two hundred leagues from the Cape, and that it was the fir&s;t which had ever been &s;een there alive. The la&s;t year, however, he &s;ent another, which is &s;till living; and, in 1767, he tran&s;mitted a &s;kin, of which we have only been able to pre&s;erve the head. The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eem to indicate, that this animal is not rare in its native country. I know not whether Kolbe means to &s;peak of the&s;e boars in the following pa&s;&s;age. 'In the country occupied by the Dutch, we rarely meet with <HI>wild hogs</HI>: As there are few woods, which are their common retreats, they have no motive to frequent the&s;e territo|ries. Be&s;ides, the lions, tigers, and other ra|pacious <PB N="253" REF="305"> pacious animals, prevent the multiplication of the hogs, by devouring great numbers of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne-e&s;perance, tom. 3. p. 43.</NOTE>.' He adds no de&s;cription; and, there|fore, no conclu&s;ion can be drawn. Be&s;ides, he ranks among the number of Cape hogs the large ant-eater, which is an American animal, and has no re&s;emblance to the hog. What credit is due to an author &s;o ill informed?</P>
<P>The body of our African boar re&s;embles that of the European kind: But it differs widely in the form of the head, which is of an enormous &s;ize. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous objects are the large tu&s;ks which &s;pring from each &s;ide of the upper jaw, and are directed almo&s;t perpendicularly up|ward. They are near &s;even inches long, and terminate in a blunt point. Two &s;imilar tu&s;ks, but &s;maller and thinner, ri&s;e from the under jaw, and apply them&s;elves exactly to the external &s;ide of the &s;uperior tu&s;ks when the mouth is &s;hut. The&s;e are powerful arms, which he may u&s;e to advantage in his native country, where he mu&s;t be often expo&s;ed to the attacks of carnivorous animals.</P>
<P>His head, which is large and flat before, ter|minates in an ample &s;nout, nearly equal in dia|meter to the breadth of the head, and of a hard|ne&s;s which approaches to that of horn. He u&s;es it, like our hogs, in digging the earth. His eyes are &s;mall, and &s;ituated &s;o far forward in the head, that he can only &s;ee &s;traight before him. They <PB N="254" REF="306"> are nearer each other and the ears, than in our European boars. Below the eyes, there is a de|pre&s;&s;ion in the &s;kin, which forms a kind of wrinkled &s;ac. The in&s;ide of his ears are clo&s;ely covered with hair. A little lower, and near the &s;ide of the eyes, the &s;kin ri&s;es and forms two ex|cre&s;cences, which, when viewed at a certain di|&s;tance, have a perfect re&s;emblance to a couple of ears, being of the &s;ame figure and &s;ize, and, though not moveable, they lie nearly in the &s;ame plane with the fore-head. Still lower, be|tween the&s;e excre&s;cences and the tu&s;ks, there is a large wart on each &s;ide of the head. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that a configuration of this kind mu&s;t give a very &s;ingular a&s;pect to the animal. When viewed in front, we think we &s;ee four ears up|on a head which has no re&s;emblance to that of any known animal, and in&s;pires terror by the largene&s;s of its tu&s;ks.</P>
<P>Pallas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pallas, Mi&s;cellanea Zoologica; et eju&s;dem Spicilegia Zoologica, Fa&s;ciculus Secundus.</NOTE> and Vo&s;ma&euml;r, who have given good de&s;criptions of this boar, tell us, that, when he arrived in Holland, he was very mild and tame; that, as he had been &s;everal months on board the ve&s;&s;el, and had been taken young, he was become almo&s;t dome&s;tic; but that, when pur&s;ued by &s;trangers, he retired &s;lowly backward, and pre&s;ented his front with a menacing air; and even tho&s;e who were daily near him were not with|out apprehen&s;ions of danger. One day he con|ceived <PB N="255" REF="307"> a re&s;entment again&s;t his keeper, whom he wounded &s;o de&s;perately in the thigh with his tu&s;ks, that the poor man died next day. To prevent &s;imilar accidents, he was taken out of the menagerie, and &s;o clo&s;ely impri&s;oned that no body could approach him. He died in about twelve months, and his &s;kin is pre&s;erved in the Prince of Orange's cabinet. The other one, which is now in the &s;ame menagerie, is &s;till very young, and his tu&s;ks exceed not two inches in length. When allowed to come out of the place where he is confined, he te&s;tifies his joy by leap|ing, bounding, and running with much more a|gility than our hogs. On the&s;e occa&s;ions he carries his tail perfectly erect. The inhabitants of the Cape, on account of his &s;wiftne&s;s, give him the denomination of <HI>hartlooper,</HI> or cour&s;er.</P>
<P>This animal unque&s;tionably forms a genus di|&s;tinct from all the other known races of hogs. Though he re&s;embles them in the body, the want of cutting teeth, and the &s;ingular &s;tructure of the head, are characters too marked to be a&s;cribed to the influence of climate, e&s;pecially as there are hogs in Africa which differ from ours only by being &s;maller. Be&s;ides, it would appear that he cannot produce with our hogs. A Guiney &s;ow was pre&s;ented to him. After &s;melling her for &s;ome time, he pur&s;ued her into a narrow place from which &s;he could not e&s;cape, and tore her to pieces with his tu&s;ks. He afterwards abu&s;ed a common &s;ow to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he was <PB N="256" REF="308"> carried off, in order to &s;ave her from de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>It is wonderful that this animal, which, as I formerly remarked, &s;eems not to be rare in its native country, has not been mentioned by any traveller, or at lea&s;t in terms &s;o vague, that no idea can be formed of it. Flacourt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de la grand i&s;le Madaga&s;car, p. 152.</NOTE> tells us, that in Madaga&s;car there are wild boars which have two horns on the &s;ide of the no&s;e, re&s;em|bling two callo&s;ities; and that the&s;e animals are nearly as dangerous as in France. M. de Buf|fon imagines, that this pa&s;&s;age relates to the babirou&s;&s;a, and perhaps he may be right: But it may, with equal probability, relate to our boar. The&s;e horns, which re&s;embled two callo&s;ities, may have been the tu&s;ks of this boar, as well as tho&s;e of the babirou&s;&s;a, though extremely ill de|&s;cribed; and, what Flacourt adds, that the&s;e ani|mals are dangerous, &s;eems to corre&s;pond better with our African boar. M. Adan&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. du Senegal, p. 76.</NOTE>, when &s;peaking of a wild boar he &s;aw in Africa, ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the&s;e terms: 'I &s;aw,' &s;ays he, 'one of tho&s;e enormous wild boars peculiar to Africa, and which, I believe, have never been mentioned by any Naturali&s;t. It was black, like the European wild boar, but va&s;tly larger in &s;ize. It had four large tu&s;ks, the two &s;u|perior of which bended in a &s;emicircular form toward the front, and had the appearance of <PB REF="309" MS="y">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate CCXCI. BOAR of CAPE VERDE</HEAD>
</FIGURE> <PB N="257" REF="310"> horns.' M. de Buffon &s;uppo&s;es, that M. Adan|&s;on means to de&s;cribe the babirou&s;&s;a; and, were it not for his authority, I &s;hould have been led to believe, that M. Adan&s;on intended to point out our African boar; for, if he had the babi|rou&s;&s;a under his in&s;pection, I cannot compre|hend how he &s;hould remark, that it had never been mentioned by any Naturali&s;t. He is too much conver&s;ant in Natural Hi&s;tory, not to know that the babirou&s;&s;a has been often de&s;cribed, and that its head is found in almo&s;t every Mu&s;aeum in Europe.</P>
<P>But in Africa there is, perhaps, another &s;pe|cies of wild boar, with which we are &s;till unac|quainted, and was the animal &s;een by M. Adan|&s;on. This conjecture is &s;upported by the de|&s;cription which M. Daubenton has given of a part of the jaws of a Cape Verd wild boar. His remarks clearly prove, that it differs from our boars, and would apply directly to the one un|der con&s;ideration, if there had not been cutting teeth in each of the&s;e jaws.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>I willingly a&s;&s;ent to mo&s;t of M. Allamand's reflections. But I per&s;i&s;t in believing, as he him&s;elf at fir&s;t believed, that the Cape Verd boar which I mentioned, and the jaws de&s;cribed by M. Daubenton, belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies, tho' <PB N="258" REF="311"> the former had no cutting teeth; for in no ani|mal is the number and order of the teeth &s;o va|rious as in the hog kind. This difference alone &s;eems not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute two &s;pecies of the African wild boar and that of Cape Verd, e&s;pecially as all the other characters of the head appear to be the &s;ame.</P>

It appears that this &s;pecies is diffu&s;ed as far as New Spain and Mexico; and that, in this warm climate, it has undergone &s;ome alte|rations, without having his nature or di&s;po&s;itions changed; for the Mexican wolf has the &s;ame figure, appetites, and habits as the European or North American wolf; and all of them appear to be the &s;ame &s;pecies. The Mexican wolf, or rather the wolf of New Spain, where he is more common than in Mexico, has five toes on the fore feet, and four on tho&s;e behind. The ears are long and erect; and the eyes &s;parkle like tho&s;e of our wolf. But the head is twice as large, the neck thicker, and the tail le&s;s bu&s;hy. Above the mouth, there are &s;ome bri&s;tles as large, but not &s;o &s;tiff, as tho&s;e of the hedge-hog. Upon an a&s;h-coloured ground, the body is marked with &s;ome yellow &s;pots. The head is of the &s;ame colour with the body, and marked with tran&s;ver&s;e browni&s;h lines, and the front is &s;potted with yellow. The ears are gray, like the head and body. There is a long yellow &s;pot on the neck, another on the brea&s;t, and a <PB N="260" REF="313"> third on the belly. On the flanks are tran&s;ver&s;e bands from the back to the belly. The tail is gray, with a yellow &s;pot in the middle. The legs are barred with gray and brown. This is the mo&s;t beautiful of all wolves, and its &s;kin &s;hould be e&s;teemed for its variety of colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It might be &s;uppo&s;ed, on account of the variety of co|lours, that the Mexican wolf is a lynx, which, like the wolf, is found in both Continents.

<HEAD>THE ALCO.</HEAD>
<P>WE formerly remarked, that, in Peru and Mexico, before the arrival of the Europeans, there were dome&s;tic animals called <HI>alco,</HI> which were nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize and di&s;po&s;itions with our &s;mall dogs; and that, from this con|formity, and becau&s;e they were equally faithful and attached to their ma&s;ters, the Spaniards gave them the name of <HI>Mexican</HI> or <HI>Peruvian dogs.</HI> The &s;pecies of the&s;e animals, indeed, &s;eems not to differ e&s;&s;entially from that of the dog. Be&s;ides, the word <HI>alco</HI> might, perhaps, be a generic and not a &s;pecific term. Recchi has left us a figure of one of the&s;e alcos, which, in the Mexican language, was called <HI>Ytzcuinte Por|zotli.</HI> It was prodigiou&s;ly fat, and probably degraded by its dome&s;tic &s;tate, and by too much nouri&s;hment. The head is repre&s;ented to be &s;o &s;mall, that it has no proportion to the &s;ize of the body. Its ears are pendulous, which is an|other mark of &s;lavery. The muzzle re&s;embles that of a dog; the fore part of the head is white, and the ears are pretty yellow. The neck is &s;o &s;hort, that there is no interval between the head <PB N="262" REF="315"> and &s;houlders. The back is arched, and cover|ed with yellow hair. The tail is white, &s;hort, and pendulous, and de&s;cends no lower than the thighs. The belly is large, ten&s;e, and marked with black &s;pots. It has &s;ix con&s;picuous paps. The legs and feet are white; and the toes, like tho&s;e of the dog, are armed with long &s;harp claws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ytzcuinte porzotli.

Fabri, who gives this de&s;cription, con|cludes, after a long di&s;&s;ertation, that this animal is the &s;ame with the <HI>alco</HI>; and I believe his con|clu&s;ion is well founded. But this appellation mu&s;t not be regarded as exclu&s;ive; for there is another race of dogs in America to which it ap|plies with equal propriety. Be&s;ide the dogs, Fernandes remarks, which the Spaniards tran&s;|ported from Europe to America, there are three other &s;pecies, which are pretty &s;imilar to ours, both in their nature and di&s;po&s;itions; neither is their figure altogether different. The fir&s;t and large&s;t of the&s;e American dogs is called <HI>Xoloizt|cuintli.</HI> He is often three cubits long; and, what is remarkable, he is totally de&s;titute of hair, and only covered with a &s;oft clo&s;e &s;kin, marked with yellow and blue &s;pots. The &s;e|cond is covered with hair, and of the &s;ize of our &s;mall Malte&s;e dogs. He is marked with <PB N="263" REF="316"> white, black, and yellow. His deformity, though &s;ingular, is not di&s;agreeable: His back is arched; and his neck &s;o &s;hort, that it &s;eems to proceed immediately from the &s;houlders. He is named in his own country <HI>michuacanens.</HI> The third, which likewi&s;e re&s;embles our &s;mall dogs, is called <HI>techichi.</HI> But he has a wild and me|lancholy a&s;pect. The Americans eat his fle&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernand. Hi&s;t. Anim. Nov. Hi&s;p. p. 6. cap. 20. et p. 10. cap. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From comparing the te&s;timonies of Fabri and Fernandes, it is obvious, that the &s;econd dog, which this la&s;t author calls <HI>michuacanens,</HI> is the &s;ame with the <HI>ytzcuinte porzotli,</HI> and that this &s;pecies of animal exi&s;ted in America before the arrival of the Europeans; and the &s;ame mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e with the <HI>techichi.</HI> I am per|&s;uaded, therefore, that the word <HI>alco</HI> was a ge|neric name, which applied equally to both, and perhaps to other races or varieties that we are unacquainted with. But, as to the fir&s;t, Fernan|des &s;eems to have been deceived both with re|gard to the name and the animal. No author mentions naked dogs in New Spain. This race, commonly called <HI>Turki&s;h dogs,</HI> come from In|dia, and other warm climates of the Old Con|tinent; and, it is probable, that tho&s;e &s;een in America by Fernandes, had been tran&s;ported thither, e&s;pecially as he mentions his having &s;een this kind in Spain, before his departure for America. The proof is &s;till farther corrobo|rated <PB N="264" REF="317"> by the circum&s;tance of this animal's having no American name: Fernandes gives it the bor|rowed one of <HI>Xoloitzcuintli,</HI> which is the name of the Mexican wolf. Thus, of the&s;e three &s;pecies or varieties of American dogs, there re|main only two, which are called indi&s;criminate|ly
<HI>alco</HI>; for, independent of the far alco, which &s;erved as a lap-dog to the Peruvian ladies, there was a meagre and melancholy alco, which was employed in the chace; and, it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible, that the three races, apparently diffe|rent from tho&s;e of our dogs, &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;tock. The dogs of Lapland, Siberia, Ice|land, &amp;c. mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed, like the foxes and wolves, from the one Continent to the other, and degenerated by the influence of the climate and a dome&s;tic &s;tate. The fir&s;t <HI>alco,</HI> with the &s;hort neck, approaches the Iceland dog; and the <HI>techichi</HI> of New Spain is, perhaps, the &s;ame animal with the <HI>koupara</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canis ferus, major, cancro&s;us, vulgo dictus <HI>koupara</HI>; <HI>Bar|r&egrave;re, Franc. Equin. p.</HI> 149.</NOTE>, or <HI>crab-dog</HI> of Gui|ana, which in figure re&s;embles the fox, and in hair the jackal. He has been called the <HI>crab-dog,</HI> becau&s;e he chiefly lives upon crabs and other cru&s;taceous animals. I have &s;een only one &s;kin of this Guiana animal; and I am unable to de|termine whether it is a particular &s;pecies, or whether it &s;hould be referred to tho&s;e of the dog, fox, or jackal.</P>

The body is covered with &s;oft hair, or rather wool of a reddi&s;h yellow colour, but of a bright red on the back. The front, muzzle, belly, and feet, are whiti&s;h yellow. The ears are naked, and pretty hard. On the upper lip, and al&s;o above the eyes, there are long hairs in the form of whi&s;kers. Its teeth, like tho&s;e of the dormou&s;e, are very &s;harp. Upon the tail of the male, which is naked, and of a pale red colour, there are du&s;ky red &s;pots, which appear not on the tail of the female. The feet re&s;emble the hands of an ape; tho&s;e before have the four toes, and the thumb garni&s;hed with &s;hort, blunt, nails; but on the hind feet the thumb alone has a flat, blunt nail, the other four toes being arm|ed with &s;mall &s;harp claws.

<P>In the original work we remarked, that the akouchi was a different &s;pecies from the agouti; becau&s;e the former had a tail, and the latter had no tail. The akouchi differs from the agou|ti &s;till more in magnitude, being no larger than a young rabbit of &s;ix months old. The akou|chi is found only in exten&s;ive woods. He feeds on the &s;ame fruits, and has nearly the &s;ame manners with the agouti. In the i&s;lands of Saint Lucia and Grenada he is called <HI>agouti.</HI> His fle&s;h is white, and has the flavour of a young rabbit; and he is ranked among&s;t the fine&s;t game in South America. When the akouchis are pur&s;ued by dogs, rather than take the wa|ter, they allow them&s;elves to be taken. M. de la Borde informs us, though I doubt the fact, that the females produce only one, or at mo&s;t two young at a litter. They are ea&s;ily tamed, and have a &s;mall cry like that of the Guiney pig; but it is &s;eldom heard.</P>

<P>Some other &s;pecies of animals might be added to the preceding li&s;t; but the accounts given of them are &s;o vague, that I choo&s;e rather to con|fine my&s;elf to what is known with &s;ome de|gree of certainty, than to give way to con|jecture, or to exhibit creatures of imagination as real &s;pecies. But, notwith&s;tanding this limi|tation, intelligent men will ea&s;ily perceive, that my hi&s;tory of quadrupeds is as complete as they could po&s;&s;ibly expect. It comprehends a great number of new animals, and none of tho&s;e who were formerly known are omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="332"> The preceding notices, though compo&s;ed of twenty-one articles, contain not above nine or ten di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for all the others are only varieties.

<P>THE name <HI>crab-eater,</HI> or <HI>crab-dog,</HI> has been given to this animal, becau&s;e crabs are his principal food. He has a very little rela|tion to the dog or fox, to which &s;ome travellers have compared him. He &s;eems to be more nearly allied to the opo&s;&s;ums; but he is much larger, and the female crab-eater carries not her young, like the female opo&s;&s;um, in a pouch under her belly. Hence the crab-eater appears to be a detached &s;pecies, and different from all tho&s;e we have formerly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the figure, the long naked, &s;caly tail, the large thumbs without claws on the hind feet, <PB N="280" REF="334"> and the flat claws on the fore feet, are remark|able. This animal, who&s;e &s;kin is pre&s;erved in the royal cabinet, was young when it was tran&s;|mitted to us. It is a male; and the following is a de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>The length of the whole body, from the no&s;e to the origin of the tail, is about &s;even|teen inches. Before, it is &s;ix inches three lines high, and &s;ix inches and a half behind. The tail, which is grayi&s;h, &s;caly, and naked, is fif|teen inches and a half long, ten lines in circum|ference at the origin, and gradually tapers to a point.</P>
<P>As the legs of this animal are very &s;hort, he has, at a di&s;tance, &s;ome re&s;emblance to a ter|rier. The head is not very different from that of a dog, and exceeds not four inches one line in length, from the point of the no&s;e to the occiput. The eye is not large; the edges of the eye-brows are black; and, above the eye, there are hairs of an inch and a quarter in length. There are &s;imilar hairs on the &s;ide of the cheek near the ear. The whi&s;kers are black, and a|bout an inch and a half long. The opening of the mouth is near two inches. The upper jaw is armed, on each &s;ide, with a crooked canine tooth, which reaches beyond the under jaw. The ear is brown, naked, broad, and round at the extremity.</P>
<P>The hair on the body is woolly, and inter|&s;per&s;ed with other long &s;tiff black hairs. The&s;e <PB N="281" REF="335"> long hairs increa&s;e upon the thighs and the &s;pine of the back, which is totally covered with them, and form a kind of mane from the middle of the back to the origin of the tail: They are three inches long, of a dirty white colour from the ba&s;e to the middle, and after|wards of a dark brown as far as the point. The hair on the &s;ides, as well as on the belly, is yel|lowi&s;h white; but it approaches more to yel|low toward the &s;houlders, and on the thighs, neck, brea&s;t, and head, where this yellow tinc|ture is mixed in &s;ome places with brown. The &s;ides of the neck are yellow; and the legs and feet are of a blacki&s;h brown colour. There are five toes on each foot. The fore foot is an inch and three quarters long, the large&s;t toe nine lines, and the furrowed claw two lines. The toes are a little bended, like tho&s;e of the rat, the thumb alone being &s;traight. The hind feet are an inch and eight lines long, the large&s;t toe nine lines, and the thumb half an inch. The thumb is thick, broad, and at a di&s;tance from the toes, as in the apes. The nail of the thumb is flat; but tho&s;e of the other toes are crooked, and reach beyond their points. The thumb of the fore foot is &s;traight, and not removed from the other toe.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde informs me, that this animal is very common in Cayenne, and that it al|ways frequents the &s;avannahs, and other mar&s;hy places.</P>
<Q><PB N="282" REF="336"> 'It climbs trees,' he remarks, 'with great dexterity, and continues oftener upon them than on the ground, e&s;pecially during the day. It has fine teeth, and defends it&s;elf a|gain&s;t the dogs. Crabs are its principal nou|ri&s;hment, and it is always fat. When unable to draw the crabs from their holes with its foot, it introduces the tail, which it u&s;es as a hook. The crab &s;ometimes lays hold of the tail, and makes the animal cry. This cry has &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of a man, and is heard at a great di&s;tance. But its or|dinary voice is a kind of grunting like pigs. The female produces four or five young at a litter, and depo&s;its them in the hollows of old trees. The natives of the country eat its fle&s;h, which re&s;embles that of a hare. The&s;e ani|mals are ea&s;ily tamed, and they are fed in the hou&s;es, like dogs and cats, with all kinds of victuals. Hence their ta&s;te for crabs is by no means exclu&s;ive.'</Q>
<P>It is alledged, that there are two &s;pecies of crab-eaters in Cayenne. The fir&s;t is the ani|mal we have already de&s;cribed: The other is not only a different &s;pecies, but belongs to a different genus. Its tail is totally covered with hair, and it &s;eizes crabs with its paws only. The&s;e two animals re&s;emble each other in the head alone; and they differ in the figure and proportions of the body, as well as in the &s;truc|ture of the feet and claws.</P>

<HEAD>ANONYMOUS ANIMAL.</HEAD>
<P>WE here give the figure of an unde&s;cribed a|nimal, the drawing of which was made by the Chevalier Bruce, who permitted me to copy it. This animal, which we &s;hall call <HI>anonymous,</HI> till we learn its real name, has &s;ome &s;imilarities to the hare, and others to the &s;quirrel. Mr Bruce gave the following account of it in writing.</P>
<Q>In Lybia, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake formerly called <HI>Palus Tritonides,</HI> there is a very &s;ingular animal, from nine to ten inches long, with ears nearly as long as the half of the body, and pro|portionally broad, a circum&s;tance which takes place in no other quadruped, except the long-eared bat. Its muzzle re&s;embles that of the fox; and yet it &s;eems to approach nearer to that of the &s;quirrel. It lives on the palm-trees, of which it eats the fruit. It has &s;hort retractile claws, and is a very beautiful crea|ture. Its colour is white mixed with a little gray and a bright yellow. The in&s;ide of the ears is naked in the middle only. They are covered with brown hair mingled with yellow, and garni&s;hed within with large white hairs. The end of the no&s;e is black, the tail yellow, and black at the point. The tail is pretty <PB N="284" REF="340"> long, but of a different form from that of the &s;quirrel; and all the hair, both on the body and tail, is very &s;oft.</Q>

<HEAD>MADAGASCAR RAT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the figure is repre&s;ented a &s;mall animal from Madaga&s;car, which was drawn alive, when in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Counte&s;s of Mar&s;an. It appeared to make a nearer approach to the &s;pe|cies of the palm-&s;quirrel than to that of the rat; for I was a&s;&s;ured that it frequented the palm-trees. I have not been able to procure farther information concerning this animal. It may be remarked, however, that, as its claws did not project, it &s;eemed to con&s;titute a &s;pecies very dif|ferent from that of the rat, and to approach nearer to the palm-&s;quirrel. To this animal may be referred the rat on the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of Madaga&s;car, mentioned by the Dutch voyagers; for they tell us, that the&s;e rats live in the palm-trees, and eat the dates; that their body is long, their muzzle &s;harp, their legs &s;hort, and their tail long and &s;potted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recueil des voyages qui ont &s;ervi &agrave; l'&eacute;tabli&s;&s;ement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales, tom. 1. p. 413.</NOTE>.

<P>It lived &s;everal years with the Counte&s;s of Mar&s;an. Its movements were extremely bri&s;k, and its cry was nearly &s;imilar, though much weaker, than that of the &s;quirrel. Like the &s;quirrels, it carried its food to its mouth with the fore paws, erected its tail, and leaped about. It bit de&s;perately, and could not be tamed. It was fed with almonds and fruits. It never came out of its cage, except in the night; and it endured the winters very well in an apartment where the cold was moderated by a &s;mall fire.</P>
