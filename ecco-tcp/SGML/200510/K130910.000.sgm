<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, you mu&s;t regulate your fire ac|cording
to the Piece of meat you are to dre&s;s:&mdash;
If it be a &s;mall or thin piece, make a pretty
little bri&s;k fire; but if it be a large joint, let a
very good fire be laid to cake. Take care to
keep your fire always clear, and let your &s;pit be
very clean. When the &s;team draws near the
fire, it is a &s;ign that the meat is done enough;
but you will be&s;t judge of that from the time it
was put down. Ob&s;erve, that in fro&s;ty weather
all kinds of meat take more time in dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Veni&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE a haunch of veni&s;on, and when you have
&s;pitted it, lay over it a large &s;heet of white
paper, then a thin pa&s;te with another &s;heet of paper
over it, and tie it well to prevent the pa&s;te from falling.
<PB N="2" REF="4">
About five or &s;ix minutes before you take it up,
take off the paper and pa&s;te, ba&s;te it with butter,
and dredge it with a little flour: when you di&s;h it
up, let it be accompanied with &s;ome good gravy in
one &s;auceboat, and &s;weet &s;auce in another. If it
be a large haunch, it will take three hours roa&s;ting.
The neck and &s;houlder may be dre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame
way. The &s;auce for veni&s;on may be either cur|rent
jelly warmed, or half a pint of red wine, with
a quarter of a pound of &s;ugar, &s;immered over a clear
fire for &s;even or eight minutes; or about half a pint
of vinegar, with a proportionate quantity of &s;ugar,
&s;immered till it becomes of the con&s;i&s;tence of a
&s;yrup.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Mutton.</HEAD>
<P>If it be a Chine or faddle of mutton, you mu&s;t
rai&s;e the &s;kin, and then &s;kewer it on again; for that
will prevent its being &s;corched. Strip off the &s;kin
about a quarter of an hour before you take it up;
throw &s;ome flour on your meat, together with a
handful of &s;alt, and ba&s;te it with butter. Roa&s;t mut|ton,
when &s;erved up, may be accompanied with
French beans, broccoli, potatoes, cauliflower, hor&s;e|radi&s;h,
or water cre&s;&s;es.&mdash;N. B. Onion &s;auce is
frequently u&s;ed with a &s;houlder of mutton, either
roa&s;ted or boiled.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Mutton &s;o as to make it eat like Veni&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>Having procured a fat hind-quarter of mutton,
cut the leg in the &s;hape of a haunch of veni&s;on, lay
it in a pan, and pour over it a bottle of red wine, in
which it mu&s;t lie twenty-four hours; then put it on
the &s;pit, and ba&s;te it with the &s;ame liquor and butter
all the time it is roa&s;ting. If you have a good
quick fire, your meat will be done in two hours.
You may &s;end it to table with &s;ome good gravy in
one ba&s;on, and current jelly in another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t a Pig.</HEAD>
<P>Put into the belly of your pig a few &s;age leaves
chopped, a piece of butter, a cru&s;t of bread grated,
and &s;ome pepper and &s;alt; &s;ew it up, &s;pit it, and lay
it down to a large bri&s;k fire. Flour it all over very
thick, and continue to do &s;o till the eyes begin to
&s;tart. As &s;oon as you find the &s;kin tight and cri&s;p,
and that the eyes are dropped, &s;et two ba&s;ons in
the dripping-pan, to receive the gravy that comes
from it. When the pig is done enough, put a lump
of butter into a cloth, and rub all over it, till the
flour is quite off; then take it up into your di&s;h, and
having cut off the head, cut the pig in two down
the back; chop off the ears, and place one upon
each &s;houlder; cut the under jaw in two, and lay on
each &s;ide; melt &s;ome butter, put it into the gravy
that came from your pig, boil it up and put it into
the di&s;h with the brains brui&s;ed fine, and a little
&s;hred &s;age; then &s;end the whole to table, with bread
&s;auce in a ba&s;on, and garni&s;h with lemon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>A Pig barbecued.</HEAD>
<P>Take two or three anchovies, a few leaves of
&s;age, and the liver of the pig; chop them very
&s;mall, and put them into a marble mortar, with half
a pint of red wine, &s;ome butter, bread-crumbs, and
pepper: beat them all together to a pa&s;te, and &s;ew
them up in your pig's belly; then lay it down to
the fire, &s;inge it well, pour in the dripping pan
two or three bottles of red wine, and ba&s;te it with
the wine all the time it is roa&s;ting. When it is
almo&s;t done, take the &s;auce out of your dripping-pan,
add to it one anchovy, half a lemon, and a
bunch of &s;weet herbs, boil the&s;e a few minutes,
then take up your pig, put a &s;mall lemon, or apple
in its mouth, &s;train your &s;auce, and pour it on
boiling hot; lay barberries and &s;liced lemon round
the pig, and &s;erve it up whole.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="6">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t a Leg of Mutton with Oy&s;ters or Cockles.</HEAD>
<P>Take a leg of mutton that has been butchered two
or three days before, &s;tuff it all over with oy&s;ters or
cockles, and roa&s;t it. Garni&s;h the di&s;h with hor&s;e|radi&s;h.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Beef.</HEAD>
<P>Butter a piece of writing-paper, and fa&s;ten it with
&s;mall &s;kewers to the top of your beef; then lay it
down to a good fire, throw &s;ome &s;alt on it, and ba&s;te
it well with good dripping. A little while before
you take it up, remove the paper, dredge the meat
with &s;ome flour, and ba&s;te it with a piece of butter.
Garni&s;h the di&s;h with &s;craped hor&s;e-radi&s;h, and &s;end
it to table with broccoli, French beans, potatoes,
hor&s;e-radi&s;h, or cauliflower. When you want to
keep your meat a few days before you dre&s;s it, you
mu&s;t dry it well with a clean cloth, then flour it all
over, and hang it up in a place where the air may
come to it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Veal.</HEAD>
<P>In dre&s;&s;ing a fillet or loin of veal, paper the udder
of the fillet to pre&s;erve the fat, and the back of the
loin to prevent it from being &s;corched. Lay your
meat at &s;ome di&s;tance from the fire till it is &s;oaked,
and then draw it nearer the fire; ba&s;te it well with
butter, and du&s;t it with a little flour. The &s;tuffing
for a fillet is made thus: take half a pound of &s;uet,
about a pound of grated bread, &s;ome par&s;ley, thyme,
&s;weet marjoram, and &s;avory, a piece of lemon-peel,
nutmeg, pepper, and &s;alt, and mix them up together
with the yolks and whites of a few eggs.</P>
<P>A brea&s;t of veal mu&s;t be roa&s;ted with the caul on,
and the &s;weet-bread &s;kewered on the back-&s;ide:
when it is almo&s;t done, take off the caul, and ba&s;te
it with butter and a little flour.</P>

<HEAD>To roa&s;t Lamb.</HEAD>
<P>When you lay it down, ba&s;te it well with fre&s;h
butter, and &s;catter on it a very little flour; then ba&s;te
it with what drips from it; and ju&s;t before you
take it up, &s;prinkle on a little &s;alt and chopped par|&s;ley,
and ba&s;te it again with butter. You may &s;erve
it up with mint &s;auce, green pea&s;e, a &s;allad, cauli|flower,
or French-beans.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t a Leg of Lamb with Forcemeat.</HEAD>
<P>Take a large leg of lamb, and with a &s;harp knife
cut off all the meat, leaving the &s;kin whole with the
fat on it: then chop the meat &s;mall with half a
pound of beef &s;uet, &s;ome marrow, a few oy&s;ters, an
onion, an anchovy, &s;ome &s;weet herbs, lemon-peel,
mace, and nutmeg; and having beat all the&s;e toge|ther

when done, pour &s;ome nice gravy into the di&s;h,
and &s;end it up.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>To roa&s;t Pork.</HEAD>
<P>In roa&s;ting a loin of pork, you mu&s;t cut the &s;kin
acro&s;s in &s;mall &s;treaks, and take care that it be joint|ed
before you lay it down; it is &s;ometimes &s;erved
up with onions.&mdash;A &s;parerib &s;hould be roa&s;ted before
a clear fire, and ba&s;ted with a &s;mall piece of butter,
a little flour, and &s;ome &s;age &s;hred fine: &s;end it up
with apple &s;auce.&mdash;The knuckle of a roa&s;t leg of pork
is frequently &s;tuffed with &s;age and onion chopped
&s;mall, with a little pepper and &s;alt, and eat with gra|vy
and apple &s;auce. But the be&s;t way of roa&s;ting a
leg is as follows: fir&s;t parboil it, then &s;kin it and
lay it down, and ba&s;te it with butter; take a little
&s;age &s;hred fine, a few crumbs of bread, &s;ome nutmeg,
pepper and &s;alt; mix the&s;e together, and &s;trew them
over your meat white it is roa&s;ting: &s;end up &s;ome

well with butter, &s;tick ten or twelve cloves about it,
and &s;end it to table with &s;ome gravy and &s;weet &s;auce.

off, then &s;tick it with cloves, put it on the &s;pit, wrap
a veal caul over it, and roa&s;t it till it is enough; af|ter

half a pound of fre&s;h butter into your dripping-pan,

<HEAD>How to chu&s;e Beef.</HEAD>
<P>IF the beef be young, it will be &s;mooth and
tender; if old, it generally appears rough and
&s;pongy. When it is of a carnation colour, it is a
&s;ign of its being good &s;pending meat.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To chu&s;e Mutton.</HEAD>
<P>When mutton is old, the fle&s;h, when pinched,
will wrinkle, and continue &s;o; if it be young, the
fle&s;h will pinch tender, and the fat will ea&s;ily
part from the lean; whereas, when the meat is
old, the fat will &s;tick by &s;trings and &s;kins. The
fle&s;h of ewe mutton is in general paler than that
of wether mutton; it is of a clo&s;er grain, and
<PB N="98" REF="98">
parts more ea&s;ily. When the fle&s;h of mutton is loo&s;e
at the bone, and of a pale yellowi&s;h colour, it is an
indication of its being &s;omewhat rotten.</P>

<HEAD>To chu&s;e Lamb.</HEAD>
<P>If a hind-quarter of lamb has a &s;aint &s;mell under
the kidney, and the knuckle be limber, it is &s;tale
meat. If the neck vein of a fore quarter be of an
azure colour, it is new and good meat; but if
greeni&s;h, or yellowi&s;h, the meat is nearly tainted.</P>

<HEAD>To chu&s;e Pork.</HEAD>
<P>If the pork be old, the lean will be tough, and
the fat &s;pongy and flabby; if young, the lean,
when pinched, will break between your fingers,
and when you nip the &s;kin with your nails, it will
make a dent. The &s;kin of pork is in general
clammy and &s;weaty when the meat is &s;tale, but
&s;mooth and cool when new. When many little
kernels, like hail-&s;hot, are found in the fat of pork,
it is then mea&s;ly.</P>

<P>Mo&s;t &s;tarchers boil their mu&s;lins, but they

you mu&s;t make the rin&s;ing-water a little bluer:
After you have rin&s;ed them, &s;queeze them one by

out with dry hands, double them upon a clean
dry cloth, in order to &s;tarch them. Some people
&s;tarch them dry; but they ought not, for it makes

<DIV3 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>To make Starch for the Mu&s;lins.</HEAD>
<P>Take a pint of pump water to a quarter of a
pound of &s;tarch, put the water in a &s;killet, and put
it over a clear fire till it is luke-warm, then put in
your &s;tarch, keep it &s;tirring &s;lowly one way till it
boils, one boil and no more, then pour it into a
pan, cover it with a plate till it is cold; when it is
cold, take &s;ome upon your hand, and &s;ome blue
in the other hand, then mix them together, but
make it not too blue, for the le&s;s blue the better:
You need not make any more at a time, keep it not
above a week, for that will make your mu&s;lins look
yellow: Take your mu&s;lins doubled as before, one
by one, then &s;pread the &s;tarch with your hand,
but not too thick, fir&s;t on one &s;ide, and then on the
other, but not open it; then blue the fine&s;t mu&s;lins
fir&s;t, and then the thicker, for the &s;tarch that
comes out of the fine&s;t will &s;tarch the thick ones;
and the &s;ame &s;tarch that comes out of the mu&s;lins
will &s;tarch aprons, caps and handkerchiefs, for
thin &s;tarch is be&s;t for them, becau&s;e they mu&s;t not
be too &s;tiff.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="112">
When you have &s;tarched the mu&s;lins, lay them
in an earthen di&s;h, kneading them with your dou|ble
fi&s;t till the &s;tarch &s;ticks about your hands, then
&s;queezing them hard, wipe them with a dry cloth,
after that open them, and rub them &s;lightly through
your hands.</P>
<P>When you have opened them, and rubbed
them, take the two ends and &s;o clap them between
your hands, pull them out very well, to you and
from you, to prevent the fraying. Be &s;ure your
hands are dry.</P>
<P>If any of the &s;tarch remains on your hands, it
will fray the mu&s;lin; dry them well, and as you
pull them out, hold them again&s;t the light to &s;ee if
they are clapped enough.</P>
<P>If any thing looks &s;hining, that is the &s;tarch,
you mu&s;t rub it over gently; when they are clap|ped
enough, you will ob&s;erve them to fly a&s;under,
and not &s;tick to your hands; but ob&s;erve to clap
very thick, and very hard, for if you let them dry
they will be limber, &s;o that when you &s;ee no
&s;hining, they are clapped enough. You mu&s;t never
clap them &s;ingle, for that frays and tears them;
neither clap by the fire, except in fro&s;ty weather,
for that &s;poils the colour.</P>
<P>For the ironing of mu&s;lins, pull them out dou|ble
on the board, as &s;mooth and even as you can,
and &s;o on till you fini&s;h about &s;ix one upon ano|ther;
then, with your box-iron, iron the under
two fir&s;t, becau&s;e that is the drie&s;t, and &s;hould be
pretty dry, but not quite dry, that you may iron
them even, and prevent fraying. Let fine plain
mu&s;lin be ironed upon a &s;oft woollen cloth; but
if you have any that is coar&s;e or thick, you mu&s;t
fir&s;t iron them upon a damp cloth, and then after|wards
upon your ironing-cloth, the wrong
&s;ide.</P>
<P>As for lawns, in the wa&s;hing and rin&s;ing, do
them as you do mu&s;lins; make a very thin &s;tarch,

but not water &s;tarch; dip them in, and &s;queeze
them out hard, wipe them with a dry cloth very
hard, and clap them carefully, for they are very
apt to &s;lip; then fold them up, and put them into
a dry pan when they are clapped enough: If
you touch them with any wet, it will leave a &s;ort
of thick look, and &s;o will mu&s;lins. You may iron
them on a damp cloth like the mu&s;lins, but not with
too hot an iron; and al&s;o iron them on the wrong
&s;ide, as you do the thick mu&s;lins.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not &s;tarch with &s;tarch left from other
things, therefore make fre&s;h as before, and &s;ee
that the &s;ame be a little matter bluer than be|fore.</P>
<P>As for night-caps, aprons, &amp;c. you mu&s;t &s;tarch
them in very thin &s;tarch, which comes from the
mu&s;lins; but it mu&s;t be thicker than water &s;tarch,
a &s;mall matter of clapping &s;erves them; but ob|&s;erve
that they are clear; you mu&s;t al&s;o pull them
out towards the gathers, to prevent the fraying
them. Every way double them, and lay them on
the board as even as you can, and let them lie till
they are pretty near dry; then put them even, and
iron them on the wrong &s;ides.</P>
<P>To do lace the be&s;t way, you mu&s;t &s;ew tape to
each &s;ide of the lace, then wa&s;h it among&s;t other
mu&s;lins, or by it&s;elf, in three lathers, and if it
looks not white, put it into warm butter-milk,
and let it lie a day, then hang it to dry, and then
wa&s;h it out in two or three lathers, but the lathers
mu&s;t be blue, after which take it out, and pin it
upon your board by the tapes very even; then
take mu&s;lins the length of the lace, and dip it in
water &s;tarch, and &s;o lay it upon the lace till it
dries; ob&s;erve not to &s;queeze any of the &s;tarch out
of the mu&s;lin.</P>
<P>When the lace is dry, take off the tapes;
after which pick the purls and the foot very
tenderly.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114">
If you open the purls, you mu&s;t make a round
hardi&s;h pillow, and lay paper on it, which will

lace upon the paper, and, with a long &s;lender nee|dle,
with a bit of wax at the head, you may ea&s;ily
open them, if they are well picked out at fir&s;t;

<HEAD>Of Brewing Strong OCTOBER BEER.</HEAD>
<P>CARE, in the fir&s;t place, mu&s;t be taken that
the malt be very clean, and when it is ground,
it &s;hould &s;tand four and twenty hours at lea&s;t in the
&s;acks.</P>
<P>The quantity is five quarters of malt to three
hog&s;heads of beer, and eighteen pounds of hops,
unle&s;s the malt be pale dried, then there mu&s;t be
added three or four pounds more.</P>
<P>The choice of liquor for brewing is of con&s;ider|able
advantage, the &s;ofte&s;t and cleane&s;t water is the
be&s;t.</P>
<P>You are to boil your fir&s;t liquor, adding a hand|ful
or two of hops to it, then, before your &s;trike it
over to your malt, cool it in as much liquor as will
bring it to a temper, not to &s;cald the malt; for it
is a fault not to take the liquor as high as po&s;&s;ible,
but not to &s;cald.</P>
<P>The next liquors do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And, indeed, all your liquors ought to be taken
as high may be, that is, not to &s;cald.</P>
<P>When you let your wort from your malt into the
under-back, put to it a handful or two of hops, it
will pre&s;erve it from that accident which brewers
call, Blinking or Foxing.</P>
<P>In boiling your worts, the fir&s;t wort boil high
or quick; for the quicker the wort is boiled the
better it is.</P>
<P>The &s;econd boil more than the fir&s;t, and the third
or la&s;t more than the &s;econd.</P>
<P>In cooling, lay your worts thin, and let each be
well cooled, and care mu&s;t be taken in letting them
down into the tun, that you do it lei&s;urely, to the
end, that as little of the foeces, or &s;ediment, as
<PB N="137" REF="135">
po&s;&s;ible, may pa&s;s with it, which cau&s;es the fer|mentation
to be fierce or mild, for,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> There is in all fermented liquors &s;alt and
&s;ulphur, and to keep the&s;e two bodies in a due pro|portion,
that the &s;alt does not exalt it&s;elf above
the &s;ulphur, con&s;i&s;ts a great Part of the art in
brewing.</P>
<P>When your wort is fir&s;t let into your tun, put
but a little yea&s;t to it, and let it work by degrees
quietly, and if you find it works but moderate,
whip in the yea&s;t two or three times or more,
till you find your drink well fermented, for without
a full opening of the body by fermentation, it
will not be perfectly fine, nor will it drink clean
or light.</P>
<P>When you clean&s;e, do it by a cock from your
tun, placed &s;ix inches from the bottom, to the
end that mo&s;t of the &s;ediment may be left behind,
which may be thrown on your malt to mend your
&s;mall-beer.</P>
<P>When your drink is tunned, fill your ve&s;&s;el full;
let it work at the bung hole, and have a re&s;erve in
a &s;mall ca&s;k to fill it up, and do not put any of the
drink, which will be under the yea&s;t after it is
worked over, into your ve&s;&s;els; but put it by it&s;elf
into another ca&s;k, for it will not be &s;o good as your
other in the ca&s;k.</P>
<P>This done, you mu&s;t wait for the fini&s;hing the
fermentation; then &s;top it clo&s;e, and let it &s;tand
till the Spring, for brewing ought to be done in
the month of October, that it may have time to
&s;ettle and dige&s;t all the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Spring you mu&s;t un&s;top your vent-hole,
and thereby &s;ee whether your drink doth ferment
or not; for as &s;oon as the warm weather comes,
your drink will have another fermentation, which,
when it is over, let it be again well &s;topped, and
&s;tand till September, or longer, and then peg it if
you find it pretty fine, the hop well rotted, and of

<P>Having got a large nutmeg, grate one half of
it, and toa&s;t the flat &s;ide of the other 'till the oily
part begins to &s;weat out; then clap it to the pit of
the patient's &s;tomach as hot as can be endured, and
keep it on whil&s;t it continues warm, and then, if
need be, put on another. This is recommended
by the famous Mr. Boyle.</P>

<HEAD>SOME
GENERAL RULES
TO BE OBSERVED IN
COOKERY.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we conclude this Work, we think
it may not be improper to give our readers
&s;ome General Rules in Cookery.<LIST>
<ITEM N="1">I. In all &s;oups you mu&s;t ob&s;erve not to put in
your thickening, 'till your herbs are very tender.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="2">II. When you boil any greens, fir&s;t &s;oak them
near two hours in water and &s;alt, or el&s;e boil them
in water and &s;alt in a copper by them&s;elves, with
a great quantity of water: Boil no meat with them
for that di&s;colours them.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="3">III. U&s;e no iron pans, &amp;c. for they are not proper;
but let them be copper, bra&s;s, or &s;ilver.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="4">IV. When you fry any Fi&s;h, fir&s;t dip them in
yolks of eggs, and fry them rather in a &s;tew-pan
over the fire, and that will make them of a light
gold colour.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="5"><PB N="164" REF="160">
V. White &s;auces being now more generally u&s;ed
than brown; the&s;e are chiefly to be made &s;o with
cream, and adding a little Champaign or French
white wine, and butter rolled up in flour.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="6">VI. Parboil all your meats that you u&s;e for fri|ca&s;ees,
or el&s;e &s;tewing them too long on the fire will
make them hard.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="7">VII. In roa&s;ting or boiling, a quarter of an hour
to every pound of meat, at a &s;teady fire, is the be&s;t
rule that can be given to do it to perfection.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="8">VIII. When you beat almonds, always put in
orange flower-water, or ro&s;e-water, to prevent their
turning to oil, which they are &s;ubject to.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="9">IX. When you dre&s;s mutton, pigeons, &amp;c. in
blood, always wring in &s;ome lemon-juice, to keep
it from changing.</ITEM>
<ITEM N="10">X. When you grill any thing, let it be over a
&s;tove of charcoal, rather than &s;ea-coal; it makes
it eat &s;weeter and &s;horter; turn your meat very
often.</ITEM>
