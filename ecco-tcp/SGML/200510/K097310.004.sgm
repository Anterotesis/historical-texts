<P>NEITHER maje&s;ty and elegance of form,
&s;trength of body, freedom of movement,
nor other external qualities, con&s;titute the
principal dignity of animated beings. In man,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
we prefer genius to figure, courage to &s;trength,
and &s;entiment to beauty; and, therefore, we are
induced to think, that the chief excellence of an
animal con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o of internal qualities. By
the&s;e he differs from an automation, ri&s;es above
the vegetable tribes, and approaches the human
&s;pecies. It is &s;entiment which ennobles, go|verns,
and gives activity to all his organs and
propen&s;ities. Hence the perfection of an ani|mal
depends on &s;entiment alone; and, in pro|portion
to its extent, his faculties, re&s;ources, and
relations with the re&s;t of the univer&s;e, are aug|mented.
When his &s;entiment is delicate, and
improved by education, he is then fit to a&s;&s;ociate
with man, to concur with his de&s;igns, to aid, to
defend, and to care&s;s him. By a frequent per|formance
of the&s;e &s;ervices, he conciliates the fa|vour
of his ma&s;ter, and, from a tyrant, converts
him into a friend and protector.</P>
<P>The dog, independent of the beauty of his
figure, his &s;trength, vivacity, and nimblene&s;s,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every internal excellence which can at|tract
the regard of man. A pa&s;&s;ionate, and even
a ferocious and &s;anguinary temper, renders the
wild dog formidable to all animals. But, in the
<PB N="3" REF="9">
dome&s;tic dog, the&s;e ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions vani&s;h,
and are &s;ucceeded by the &s;ofter &s;entiments of
attachment, and the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing. He runs
with chearfulne&s;s and alacrity to his ma&s;ter's
foot, where he lays down his courage, his
&s;trength, and his talents. He attends for or|ders,
which he is always &s;olicitous to execute.
He con&s;ults, he interrogates, he &s;upplicates his
ma&s;ter. A &s;ingle glance of the eye is &s;ufficient;
for he knows the external &s;igns of our inten|tions
and wi&s;hes. Without being endowed, like
man, with the faculty of thinking, his feelings
are extremely delicate, and he has more fidelity
and &s;teadine&s;s in his affection. He is not cor|rupted
by ambition, by intere&s;ted views, or by a
de&s;ire of revenge; and he has no fear, but that
of di&s;plea&s;ing. He is all zeal, ardour, and obe|dience.
More apt to recal benefits than out|rages,
he is not di&s;couraged by blows or bad
treatment, but calmly &s;uffers, and &s;oon forgets
them; or he remembers them only to increa&s;e
his attachment. In&s;tead of flying, or di&s;cover|ing
marks of re&s;entment, he expo&s;es him&s;elf to
torture, and licks the hand from which he re|ceived
the blow. To the cruelty of his ma&s;ter,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> only oppo&s;es complaint, patience, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>More tractable than man, and more plaint
than any other animal, the dog is not only &s;oon
in&s;tructed, but even conforms him&s;elf to the
manners, movements, and habits of tho&s;e who
<PB N="4" REF="10">
govern him. He a&s;&s;umes the very tone of the
family in which he lives. Like other &s;ervants,
he is haughty with the great, and ru&s;tic with
the pea&s;ant. Always eager to obey and to plea&s;e
his ma&s;ter, or his friends, he pays no attention
to &s;trangers, and furiou&s;ly repels beggars, whom
he di&s;tingui&s;hes by their dre&s;s, their voice, and
their ge&s;tures. When the charge of a hou&s;e or
garden is committed to him during the night,
his boldne&s;s increa&s;es, and he &s;ometimes becomes
perfectly ferocious. He watches, goes the
rounds, &s;mells &s;trangers at a di&s;tance, and, if they
&s;top, or attempt to leap any barrier, he in&s;tant|ly
darts upon them, and, by barking, and other
marks of pa&s;&s;ion, alarms the family and neigh|bourhood.
Equally furious again&s;t thieves as
again&s;t rapacious animals, he attacks and wounds
them, and forces from them whatever they have
been attempting to carry off: But, contented
with victory, he lies down upon the &s;poil, and
will not touch it even to &s;atisfy his appetite, ex|hibiting,
at the &s;ame time, an example of cou|rage,
temperance, and fidelity.</P>
<P>To conceive the importance of this &s;pecies in
the order of Nature, let us &s;uppo&s;e that it never
exi&s;ted. Without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the dog, how
could man have conquered, tamed, and reduced
the other animals into &s;lavery? How could he
&s;till di&s;cover, hunt down, and de&s;troy noxious
and &s;avage bea&s;ts? For his own &s;afety, and to
render him ma&s;ter of the animated world, it was
<PB N="5" REF="11">
nece&s;&s;ary to form a party among the animals
them&s;elves, to conciliate by care&s;&s;es tho&s;e which
were capable of attachment and obedience, in
order to oppo&s;e them to the other &s;pecies. Hence
the training of the dog &s;eems to have been the
fir&s;t art invented by man; and the re&s;ult of this
art was the conque&s;t and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the earth.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t animals are &s;uperior to man in agility,
&s;wiftne&s;s, &s;trength, and even in courage: Na|ture
has fortified and armed them better. Their
&s;en&s;es, and particularly that of &s;melling, are like|wi&s;e
more perfect. To have brought over to
our intere&s;t a bold and tractable &s;pecies, like that
of the dog, was to acquire new &s;en&s;es and fa|culties.
The machines and in&s;truments we have
invented to improve, or to extend our other
&s;en&s;es, are not nearly &s;o u&s;eful as tho&s;e pre&s;ented
to us ready made by Nature, which, by &s;upply|ing
the defects of our &s;melling, have furni&s;hed
us with great and permanent re&s;ources for con|que&s;t
and dominion. The dog, ever faithful to
man, will always maintain a portion of this em|pire;
he will always pre&s;erve a degree of &s;upe|riority
above the other animals. He reigns at
the head of a flock, and is better heard than the
voice of the &s;hepherd. Safety, order, and di&s;|cipline,
are the fruits of his vigilance and acti|vity.
Sheep and cattle are a people &s;ubjected to
his management, whom he prudently conducts
and protects, and never employs force again&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="12">
them, but for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good
order.</P>
<P>But in war again&s;t his enemies, or wild ani|mals,
he makes a full di&s;play of his courage and
intelligence. Here his natural and acquired ta|lents
are united. As &s;oon as the din of arms is
heard, as &s;oon as the horn, or the voice of the
hunter, gives the alarm, the dog, &s;parkling with
redoubled ardour, demon&s;trates his joy by the
mo&s;t lively emotions: He announces, by his
movements and cries, his impatience for the
combat, and his pa&s;&s;ion for victory. Sometimes
he moves &s;ilently along, reconnoitres the ground,
and endeavours to di&s;cover and &s;urpri&s;e the e|nemy.
At other times, he traces the animal's
&s;teps, and, by different accents, indicates the di|&s;tance,
the &s;pecies, and even the age of the fu|gitive.
Pu&s;hed, intimidated, and de&s;pairing of
&s;afety from flight alone, the poor animal like|wi&s;e
exerts its faculties, and oppo&s;es craftine&s;s
to &s;agacity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See below, article Deer.</NOTE>. The re&s;ources of in&s;tinct are now
worthy of admiration. To make him lo&s;e the
&s;cent, the creature doubles, returns on its former
&s;teps, bounds, and wi&s;hes to detach it&s;elf from the
earth; at one leap it often clears a highway, or
a hedge, and &s;wims over brooks and rivers. But,
always pur&s;ued, and being unable to conceal or
annihilate its body, the animal endeavours to
&s;tart another of le&s;s experience, and, after run|ning
together till the former imagines that the
<PB N="7" REF="13">
two &s;cents or traces are confounded, it then
&s;uddenly &s;eparates, in order to let the other fall
a victim to the deceived enemy.</P>
<P>But the dog, by the &s;uperiority he has acqui|red
from habit and education, and from the pe|culiar
finene&s;s of his &s;en&s;ations, lo&s;es not the ob|ject
of his pur&s;uit. By the acutene&s;s of his &s;cent,
he unravels all the windings of the labyrinth,
all the fal&s;e routs which were intended to de|ceive
him; and, in&s;tead of abandoning the ene|my
for an indifferent animal, he redoubles his
ardour, he overtakes, attacks, &s;lays, and extin|gui&s;hes
his thir&s;t and his rage in the blood of the
victim.</P>
<P>The propen&s;ity to hunting, or to war, is e|qually
&s;trong in man as in other animals. The
whole knowledge of the Savage is confined to
fighting and hunting. All carnivorous animals,
which have weapons and &s;trength, hunt natu|rally.
The lion and the tiger, who&s;e &s;trength
is &s;o great as to in&s;ure them of victory, hunt a|lone,
and without artifice. Wolves, foxes, and
wild dogs, hunt in packs, a&s;&s;i&s;t each other with
much art, and mutually &s;hare in the prey. When
the natural talents of the dog have been impro|ved
by education, when he has learned to re|pre&s;s
his ardour, and to regulate his movements,
he then hunts artificially, and is always certain
of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In de&s;ert and depopulated countries, there are
wild dogs, which, in their manners, differ not from
<PB N="8" REF="14">
wolves, excepting by the facility with which
they may be tamed. They unite in troops, and
attack wild boars, and bulls, and even lions and
tigers. The wild dogs of America are of the
dome&s;tic race, and were tran&s;ported thither from
Europe. Some of them have been abandoned
in the&s;e de&s;erts, where they have multiplied &s;o
prodigiou&s;ly, that they &s;pread over the inhabited
countries in great packs, and attack the dome&s;tic
cattle, and even in&s;ult the natives, who are ob|liged
to di&s;per&s;e and kill them, like other fero|cious
animals. Wild dogs, though they have
no knowledge of man, when approached with
gentlene&s;s, &s;oon &s;often, become familiar, and
remain faithfully attached to their ma&s;ters. But
the wolf, though taken young, and brought up
in the hou&s;e, is only gentle when a mere cub,
never lo&s;es his ta&s;te for prey, and &s;ooner or later
indulges his inclination for rapine and de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>The dog may be &s;aid to be the only animal
who&s;e fidelity is un&s;haken; who always knows
his ma&s;ter, and the friends of the family; who
di&s;tingui&s;hes a &s;tranger as &s;oon as he arrives;
who under&s;tands his own name, and the voices
of the dome&s;tics; who confides not in him&s;elf;
who calls on his lo&s;t ma&s;ter by cries and lamen|tation;
who, in long journeys, which he has
travelled but once, remembers and finds out the
roads: In fine, the dog is the only animal who&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="15">
natural talents are con&s;picuous, and who&s;e edu|cation
is always &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the dog is al&s;o mo&s;t &s;u&s;cep|tible
of impre&s;&s;ions, mo&s;t ea&s;ily modified by
moral cau&s;es, and mo&s;t &s;ubject to alterations oc|ca&s;ioned
by phy&s;ical influence. His tempera|ment,
faculties, and habits, very prodigiou&s;ly;
and even the figure of his body is by no means
con&s;tant. In the &s;ame country, one dog differs
greatly from another; and, in different climates,
the very &s;pecies &s;eems to be changed. From
the&s;e cau&s;es, the number and mixture of races
are &s;o great, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to re|cogni&s;e
or enumerate them. To the &s;ame cau&s;es
mu&s;t be attributed tho&s;e remarkable varieties in
&s;ize, figure, length of muzzle, form of the head,
length and direction of the ears and tail, colour,
quantity of hair, &amp;c. In a word, nothing &s;eems
to be permanent in the&s;e animals but their in|ternal
organization, and the faculty of procrea|ting
together. As tho&s;e which differ mo&s;t from
each other are capable of intermixing and of
producing fertile individuals, it is evident, that
all dogs, however diver&s;ified, con&s;titute but one
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>In this numerous variety of races, it is diffi|cult
to inve&s;tigate the character of the primitive
&s;tock from which they have all &s;prung. How
&s;hall the effects produced by the influence of
climate, food, &amp;c. be di&s;tingui&s;hed? How &s;hall
we perceive the changes introduced by the
<PB N="10" REF="16">
mixture of different races when in a wild, or in
a dome&s;tic &s;tate? In the progre&s;s of time, all
the&s;e cau&s;es alter the mo&s;t permanent forms;
and the original &s;tamp of Nature never pre&s;erves
its purity in beings which have been long under
the management of man. This original im|pre&s;&s;ion
is be&s;t pre&s;erved in tho&s;e animals that
have the independent choice both of their cli|mate
and food, the mo&s;t antient of which are
&s;till faithfully repre&s;ented by their de&s;cendants.
But tho&s;e which man has &s;ubdued, tran&s;ported
from climate to climate, and changed their food,
their habits, and manner of living, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
have &s;uffered the greate&s;t alterations in
their form; and, it is a well known fact, that
there are more varieties among the dome&s;tic
than the wild animals: And, of all dome&s;tic
animals, as the dog is mo&s;t clo&s;ely attached to
man, lives as irregularly, and is endowed with
di&s;po&s;itions which render him docile, obedient,
&s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
to every re&s;traint, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that he
&s;hould likewi&s;e exhibit the greate&s;t variety in
figure, &s;ize, colour, and other qualities.</P>
<P>But other cau&s;es concur in producing the&s;e
changes. The life of the dog is &s;hort; his pro|lific
powers are great; and, as he is perpetually
under the eye of man, whenever by any acci|dent,
which is not uncommon in Nature, &s;ome
individuals, marked with &s;ingular characters, ap|peared,
they would be perpetuated by prevent|ing
<PB N="11" REF="17">
their intermixture with any other kinds, as
is done at pre&s;ent when we want to procure
new races of dogs, or of other animals. Be|&s;ides,
though every &s;pecies were equally antient,
the number of generations, from the creation,
being greater in tho&s;e who&s;e lives are &s;hort,
their varieties, alterations, and even degenera|tion,
mu&s;t become more con&s;picuous; becau&s;e
they are farther removed from the original &s;tock
than tho&s;e which live longer. Man is at pre|&s;ent
eight times nearer Adam, than the dog to
his fir&s;t parent; becau&s;e man lives eighty years,
and the dog only ten. If, therefore, by any
cau&s;e, the&s;e two &s;pecies had an equal tendency
to degenerate, the alteration would be ten times
more &s;trongly marked in the dog than in man.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;mall animals who&s;e lives are &s;o &s;hort,
that they are &s;ucceeded every year by a new
generation, are infinitely more &s;ubject to varia|tions
of every kind than tho&s;e which live longer.
The &s;ame remark is applicable to annual plants;
&s;ome of which may be con&s;idered as of an arti|ficial
or factitious nature. Wheat, for example,
has been &s;o greatly altered by man, that it is
now no where to be found in a natural &s;tate.
It has a &s;imilarity to darnel, dog's-gra&s;s, and
&s;everal other gra&s;&s;es; but &s;till we know not to
which of the&s;e plants it ought to be referred:
And, as it is annually renewed, is u&s;ed as the
common food of man, and more cultivated than
any other vegetable, its nature, of cour&s;e, has
<PB N="12" REF="18">
undergone the greate&s;t alterations. Hence man
is able, not only to make every individual in the
univer&s;e an&s;wer his own ends, but, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of time, he can change, modify, and
improve their &s;pecies. This is the chief power
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over Nature. To have transformed
a barren herb into wheat, is a kind of creation,
of which, however, we have no rea&s;on to boa&s;t,
&s;ince it is only by the &s;weet of our brows, and
reiterated culture, that we are able to extract
from the earth a &s;canty, and often a bitter &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Hence, both in the animal and vegetable king|doms,
the &s;pecies which have received the high|e&s;t
culture from man, have undergone the great|e&s;t
changes from their original condition: And,
as we are often unable to recogni&s;e their primi|tive
form, as in the example of wheat and other
grain, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that, among the nu|merous
varieties of dogs which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
not one of them &s;hould re&s;emble the fir&s;t ani|mal
of the &s;pecies that virtually gave birth to
the whole.</P>
<P>Nature, however, when not re&s;trained, never
fails to re&s;ume her rights. Wheat, when &s;own
on uncultivated ground, degenerates the very
fir&s;t year; and, if &s;own for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages
upon the &s;ame ground, this degeneration would
gradually proceed till the plant acquired its ori|ginal
from. By an experiment of this kind,
the time required by Nature for de&s;troying the
<PB N="13" REF="19">
effects of art, and re&s;uming her pri&s;tine &s;tate,
might be di&s;covered. This experiment might
be ea&s;ily performed on plants: But, in animals,
there is little hope of its &s;ucce&s;s; becau&s;e it is
difficult to manage them with &s;ufficient dexte|rity,
or to overcome their invincible repugnance
again&s;t every thing that re&s;trains or counteracts
their natural or acquired habits. We cannot,
therefore, expect to learn, by this method, the
primitive race of dogs, or of other animals
which are &s;ubjected to permanent varieties. But,
to &s;upply the place of facts which cannot be a|&s;certained,
we may collect particular marks, and
from the&s;e draw probable conjectures.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic dogs which were abandoned in
the de&s;erts of America, and have lived in a wild
&s;tate during 150 or 200 years, though original|ly
derived from altered races, mu&s;t, during &s;o
long a cour&s;e of time, have made greater or
&s;maller approaches toward their primitive form.
Travellers, however, inform us, that they re|&s;emble
our grey-hounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des avanturiers Flibu&s;tiers, par Oexmelin, tom. 1. p. 112.</NOTE>. They make the
&s;ame remark with regard to the wild dogs of
Congo<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, par l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, tom. 1. p. 86.</NOTE>, which, like tho&s;e of America, make
war in packs again&s;t tigers, lions, &amp;c. But o|thers,
without comparing the wild dogs of St
Domingo to grey-hounds, only ob&s;erve, that
they have generally a long flat head, a &s;lender
<PB N="14" REF="20">
muzzle, a ferocious air, and meagre bodies; that
they are exceedingly &s;wift in the chace, hunt in
the mo&s;t perfect manner, and ea&s;ily tame, when
taken young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nonv. voyages aux i&s;les de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</NOTE>. Thus the&s;e wild dogs are very
meagre and fleet; and, as the common grey-hounds
differs little, in other re&s;pects, from the
Iri&s;h grey-hound, or from the &s;hepherd's dog,
it is probable that tho&s;e wild dogs rather belong
to this kind than to the true grey-hound race;
for, on the other hand, the more antient travel|lers
tell us, that the native dogs of Canada had
erect ears, like the fox, and re&s;embled our vil|lage
or &s;hepherd's dog<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage du pays des Hurons, par Sabard Theodat, p. 310.</NOTE>; that tho&s;e belonging
to the &s;avages of the Antilles had very long
heads and ears, and approached to the figure of
foxes<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>; that the Indians of Peru had only a

and that tho&s;e of the I&s;thmus of America were
very ugly, and had long, coar&s;e hair, which
likewi&s;e implies erect ears<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Nouveaux voyages aux i&s;les de l'Amerique, tom. 5. p. 195.</NOTE>. Hence it is appa|rent,
that the original dogs of America, before
they had any communication with tho&s;e of Eu|rope,
were all of one race, and that they ap|proached
mo&s;t to the dogs with &s;lender muzzles,
erect ears, and coar&s;e hair, like the &s;hepherd's
<PB N="15" REF="21">
dog: And I am &s;till farther convinced that the
wild dogs of St Domingo are not genuine grey|hounds,
becau&s;e the latter is &s;o rare in France,
that they are brought, for the u&s;e of the King,
from Con&s;tantinople and other parts of the Le|vant,
and becau&s;e I never knew of any grey|hounds
being tran&s;ported to France from St Do|mingo,
or any of our American colonies. Be&s;ides,
by con&s;ulting what travellers have &s;aid concer|ning
the dogs of different countries, we find that
all the dogs of cold climates have long muzzles
and erect ears; that tho&s;e of Lapland are &s;mall,
and have long hair, erect ears, and &s;harp muz|zles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 75. II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</NOTE>;
that the Siberian dogs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate XXIX.</NOTE>, and tho&s;e called
wolf-dogs, are larger than the Lapland kind;
but their ears are &s;till erect, their hair coar&s;e,
and their muzzle &s;harp; that tho&s;e of Iceland<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate XXX.</NOTE>
are nearly &s;imilar to the Siberian dog; and, in
the &s;ame manner, that the native dogs of the
Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">De&s;crip|tion du Cap. par Kolbe, part. 1. p. 304.</NOTE>, and other warm climates,
have pointed muzzles, erect ears, long trailing
tails, and clear, but long, rough hair; that tho&s;e
dogs are excellent for guarding flocks, and, of
cour&s;e, that they re&s;emble the &s;hepherd's dog,
not only in figure, but in in&s;tinct; that, in &s;till
warmer climates, as at Madaga&s;car<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Flacourt, p. 152.</NOTE>, Madura<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage d'Innigo de Biervillas, p. 178.</NOTE>,

all long muzzles, erect ears, and have &s;uch a re|&s;emblance
to the &s;hepherd's dog, that, when I|ri&s;h
grey-hounds, &s;paniels, water-dogs, bull-dogs,
blood-hounds, grey-hounds, &amp;c. were
tran&s;ported thither, they degenerated at the &s;e|cond
or third generation; la&s;tly, that, in exce&s;|&s;ive
warm countries, as in Guiney<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voy|ages, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, tom. 4. p. 229.</NOTE>, this dege|neration
is &s;till quicker; for, in three or four
years, they lo&s;e their voice, bark no more, but
make a di&s;mal kind of howling noi&s;e; and their
progeny have erect ears, like the fox. The na|tive
dogs of tho&s;e countries are ugly animals,
with &s;harp muzzles, long erect ears, and long
pointed tails. There is no hair on their bo|dies;
their &s;kin is commonly &s;potted, but &s;ome|times
of a uniform colour: In a word, they are
di&s;agreeable to the eye, and &s;till more &s;o to the
touch.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e, with &s;ome de|gree
of probability, that the &s;hepherd's dog ap|proaches
nearer to the primitive race than any
of the other kinds; for in every country inha|bited
by &s;avage or by half civilized men, the
native dogs re&s;emble this race more than any
other. Be&s;ides, in the whole of the New Con|tinent,
there was no other variety; neither is
there any other at the &s;outh and north extre|mities
<PB N="17" REF="23">
of our own continent; and in France,
and other temperate climates, they are very nu|merous,
though greater attention has been paid
to the rearing of other more beautiful kinds,
than to the pre&s;ervation of this race, which has
no recommendation but its utility, and for that
rea&s;on has been abandoned to the care of the
&s;heep-farmers. If it be farther con&s;idered, that
this dog, notwith&s;tanding his ugline&s;s, and his
wild and melancholy a&s;pect, is &s;uperior in in|&s;tinct
to all others; that he has a decided cha|racter,
independent of education; that he a|lone
is born fully trained; that, guided &s;ole|ly
by natural powers, he applies him&s;elf &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
to the keeping of flocks, which he
executes with amazing fidelity, vigilance, and
a&s;&s;iduity; that he conducts them with an admi|rable
and uncommunicated intelligence; that his
talents, at the &s;ame time a&s;toni&s;h and give re|po&s;e
to his ma&s;ter, while other dogs require the
mo&s;t laborious in&s;truction to train them to the
purpo&s;es for which they are de&s;tined; we will
be confirmed in the opinion, that the &s;hepherd's
dog is the true dog of Nature; that he has been
preferably be&s;towed on us for the extent of his
utility; that he has a &s;uperior relation to the
general order of animated beings, who mutually
depend on each other; and, la&s;tly, that he ought
to be regarded as the origin and model of the
whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In the frozen regions of the north, the human
&s;pecies is deformed, ru&s;tic, and diminutive. Lap|land,
<PB N="18" REF="24">
Greenland, and all countries where the
cold is exce&s;&s;ive, produce only dwarfi&s;h and ugly
men. But, in the neighbouring and le&s;s rigo|rous
regions of Finland, Denmark, &amp;c. the mo&s;t
beautiful race &s;udenly appears; for, in figure,
colour, and &s;tature, they are perhaps the hand|&s;ome&s;t
of the human kind. The &s;ame phaeno|menon
is exhibited in the dog-&s;pecies. The
Lapland dogs are very ugly, and &s;o &s;mall, that
they exceed not a foot in length<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II Genio vagante, vol. 2. p. 13.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e of
Siberia, though le&s;s ugly, have erect ears, and a
&s;avage a&s;pect: But, in the neighbouring climate,
where we meet with the hand&s;ome men already
mentioned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. 3. art. Varieties of the human &s;pecies.</NOTE>, we find al&s;o the mo&s;t beautiful and
large&s;t dogs. The dogs of Tartary, of Albania,
of the north of Greece, of Denmar, and of Ire|land,
are the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of the &s;pecies,
and are u&s;ed for drawing carriages. The Iri&s;h
grey-hounds are of a very antient race, and &s;till
exi&s;t, though their number is &s;mall, in their ori|ginal
climate. They were called by the antients
dogs of Epirus, and Albanian dogs. Pliny has
recorded, in mo&s;t elegant and energetic terms, a
combat between one of the&s;e dogs, fir&s;t with a
lion, and then with an elephant<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Indiam petenti Alexandro magno, Rex Albaniae dono dederat inu&s;itatae magnitudinis unum, cujus &s;pecie delectatus, ju&s;&s;it ur&s;os. mox apros, et deinde damas emitti, contemptu im|mobili jacente eo; qua &s;egnitie tanti corporis offen&s;us Impe|rator genero&s;i &s;piritus, eum interimi ju&s;&s;it.

feet high, and re&s;embled in figure the Dani&s;h
dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate XXV.</NOTE>; but greatly exceeded him in &s;tature. He
was totally white, and of a mild and peaceable
di&s;po&s;ition. We find, then, in all the temperate
climates, as in Britain, France, Germany, Spain,
and Italy, men and dogs of all races. This va|riety
proceeds partly from the influence of cli|mate,
and partly from the great concour&s;e and
intermixture of foreigners. With regard to
dogs, I &s;hall mark, with all po&s;&s;ible attention,
the &s;imilarities and di&s;crepancies which &s;helter,
care, food, and climate, have produced among
the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h dog<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate XXV.</NOTE>, the Iri&s;h grey-hound<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate XXIV.</NOTE>,
and the common grey-hound<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See plate XXVI.</NOTE>, though they
appear to be different, are only the &s;ame dog.
The Dani&s;h dog is but a more corpulent Iri&s;h
<PB N="20" REF="26">
grey-hound; and the common grey-hound is
the Iri&s;h grey-hound rendered thinner and more
delicate by culture; for the&s;e three dogs, though
perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hable at fir&s;t &s;ight, differ not
more from each other than a Dutchman, a
Frenchman, and an Italian. If we &s;uppo&s;e the
Iri&s;h grey-hound to have been a native of France,
he would have produced the Dani&s;h dog in a
colder climate, and the common grey-hound in
a warmer one: And this conjecture is even ve|rified
by experience; for the Dani&s;h dogs come
to us from the north, and the grey-hounds from
Con&s;tantinople and the Levant. The &s;hepherd's
dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See plate XXVII.</NOTE>, the Pomeranian or wolf-dog<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXVIII.</NOTE>, the Sibe|rian
dog<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXIX.</NOTE>, to which may be joined the Lapland
dog, the Canadian dog, the Hottentot dog, and
all tho&s;e which have erect ears, con&s;titute but
one kind. They differ from the &s;hepherd's dog
only in &s;tature, in being more or le&s;s gro&s;s, or
in the length, coar&s;ene&s;s, or bu&s;hine&s;s of their
hair. The hound<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXI.</NOTE>, the harrier<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXII.</NOTE>, the turn&s;pit<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXIV.</NOTE>,
the water-dog<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXVI.</NOTE>, and even the &s;paniel<NOTE N="&Dagger;&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXXVII.</NOTE>, may
be regarded as one dog. Their figure and in|&s;tincts
are nearly the &s;ame; and they differ only
in the length of their legs, and the &s;ize of their
ears, which, however, in all of them are long,
&s;oft, and pendulous. The&s;e dogs are natives of
France; and I am uncertain whether the Dalma|tian

convinced that this dog is not an original native
of Bengal, or of any other part of India, and
that it is not, as has been pretended, the Indian
dog mentioned by the antients, and &s;aid to have
been produced between a dog and a tiger; for
it has been known in Italy above 170 years
ago, and not con&s;idered as a dog brought

But the &s;paniels and water-dogs are
natives of Spain and Barbary, where the tem|perature
of the climate renders the hair of all

The bull-dog<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate XLII.</NOTE>, what is improperly called

Iceland dog<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plate XXX.</NOTE>, con&s;titute but one race, which,
being tran&s;ported from cold countries, where the
fur is always &s;trong, into the warmer climates
of Africa and India, have lo&s;t their hair; for
the naked dog is improperly called the Turki&s;h
dog: It is not in the temperate climate of Tur|key
that dogs lo&s;e their hair, but in Guiney,
and the warm regions of India. The Turki&s;h
dog is nothing but the &s;mall Dani&s;h dog, which
has fir&s;t been tran&s;ported to a very warm climate,
where it ca&s;t its hair, and then afterwards
brought to Turkey, and propagated carefully on
account of its &s;ingularity. The fir&s;t of them,
&s;ays Aldrovandus, which appeared in Europe,
were brought into Italy in his own time, where
they could not be propagated, becau&s;e the cli|mate
was too cold for them. But, as he gives
no de&s;cription of the&s;e naked dogs, we know
not whether they were &s;imilar to what is now
called the Turki&s;h, nor, con&s;equently, whether
they can be referred to the &s;mall Dani&s;h dog;
becau&s;e dogs of every kind lo&s;e their hair in very
warm climates<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, par. M. l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, tom. 4. p. 229.</NOTE>; and, as formerly remarked,
they al&s;o lo&s;e their voice. In &s;ome countries,
they are perfectly mute; in others, they lo&s;e
only the faculty of barking, but howl like wolves,
<PB N="23" REF="29">
or yelp like foxes. This change &s;eems to make
them approach to their natural &s;tate; for both

that dogs pre&s;erve their ardour, courage, &s;agacity,
and other talents. They lo&s;e every thing, when
tran&s;ported to very hot countries. But, as if Na|ture
never made any being perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, in
climates where dogs cannot &s;erve the purpo&s;es for
which we employ them, they are in great reque&s;t
for the table, and their fle&s;h is preferred by the
Negroes to that of all other animals. They &s;ell
dogs in the market as dear as mutton, veni&s;on,
or game of any kind, a roa&s;ted dog being the
mo&s;t luxurious fea&s;t to a Negro. Perhaps this
remarkable appetite for dogs fle&s;h is owing to a
change produced in its quality by the heat of the
country; for, in our climates, it is extremely
di&s;agreeable. But I am inclined to think that
this appetite depends more on the nature of man
than that of the dog; for the &s;avages of Canada,
who inhabit a cold country, are equally fond of
dogs fle&s;h with the Negroes; and our mi&s;&s;ionaries
&s;ometimes eat of it without di&s;gu&s;t. P. Sabard

<P>In our climates, the wolf and fox make the
neare&s;t approach to the dog, particularly to
the &s;hepherd's dog, which I con&s;ider as the
original &s;tock of the &s;pecies: And, as their
internal &s;tructure is almo&s;t entirely the &s;ame,
and their external differences very &s;light, I
wi&s;hed to try if they would intermix and pro|duce
together. I hoped, at lea&s;t, to make them
copulate; and, if they produced not fertile in|dividuals,
I expected to procure mules which
would participate of the nature of both animals.
With this view, I reared a &s;he-wolf, taken in
the woods at the age of three months, along
with an Iri&s;h grey-hound of the &s;ame age. They
were &s;hut up together in a pretty large court, to
which no other bea&s;t could have acce&s;s, and
where they were provided with a &s;helter for
their retirement. They were equally &s;trangers
to any individual of their own &s;pecies, and knew
no per&s;on but the man who gave them their
victuals. They were kept in this &s;tate three
years, without the &s;malle&s;t re&s;traint. During
the fir&s;t year, they played perpetually, and &s;eem|ed
to be extremely fond of each other. The
<PB N="25" REF="31">
&s;econd year they began to quarrel about their
food, though they were &s;upplied in a plentiful
manner. The wolf always began the di&s;pute.
When meat and bones were given them on a
large wooden di&s;h, the wolf, in&s;tead of &s;eizing
the meat, in&s;tantly drove off the dog, then laid
hold of the edge of the plate &s;o dexterou&s;ly as
to allow nothing to fall, and carried off the whole.
I have &s;een her run, in this manner, with the di&s;h
in her teeth, five or &s;ix times round the wall,
and never &s;et it down, unle&s;s to take breath, to
devour the meat, or to attack the dog, when he
approached. The dog was &s;tronger than the
wolf: But, as he was le&s;s ferocious, we began
to be apprehen&s;ive for his life, and therefore
furni&s;hed him with a collar. After the &s;econd
year, the&s;e quarrels and combats became more
frequent, and more &s;erious, and a collar was al&s;o
given to the wolf, whom the dog now handled
more roughly than before.</P>
<P>During the&s;e two years, not the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymp|tom
of de&s;ire appeared either in the one or the
other. At the end of the third year, they
began to feel all the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion; but di&s;|covered
no marks of love. This condition, in|&s;tead
of &s;oftening and making them approach
each other, rendered them more untractable and
ferocious. Nothing now was heard but di&s;mal
howlings, and cries of re&s;entment. In three
weeks they were both very meagre; but never
approached but to tear each other. At la&s;t they
<PB N="26" REF="32">
fought &s;o cruelly that the dog killed the wolf.
The dog was &s;hot &s;ome days after, becau&s;e,
as &s;oon as he was &s;et at liberty, he &s;prung with
fury upon poultry, dogs, and even men.</P>
<P>I had, at the &s;ame time, three young foxes,
two males and a female, which were taken with
nets, and kept in &s;eparate apartments. One of
them was &s;ecured by a long, light chain, and a
hut was built for &s;heltering him. I kept him
&s;everal months; and, though he had a melan|choly
air, and kept his eyes fixed upon the fields,
of which he had a view from his hut, yet both
his health and appetite were good. A bitch in
&s;ea&s;on was pre&s;ented to him; but, as &s;he would
not remain near the fox, &s;he was chained in the
&s;ame place, and both were amply provided with
victuals. The fox neither bit nor maletreated
her. During ten days that they lived together,
there was not the &s;malle&s;t quarrel, neither night
nor day, nor during the time of feeding. The
fox even approached her pretty familiarly; but,
as &s;oon as he had &s;cented her too near, the mark
of de&s;ire di&s;appeared, he mournfully return|ed
to his hut, and no commixture took place.
When the ardour of this bitch was gone, another,
and afterwards a third, and a fourth, were &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
pre&s;ented to him. He treated them
with the &s;ame gentlene&s;s, and the &s;ame indif|ference.
To a&s;certain whether this indifference
was owing to a natural repugnance, or to a &s;tate
of re&s;traint, he was furni&s;hed with a female of
<PB N="27" REF="33">
his own &s;pecies, which he covered more than
once the fir&s;t day. The female was di&s;&s;ected
&s;ome weeks after, and four foetus's were found
in the uterus. The male fox was then let loo&s;e
in a clo&s;e court, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively furni&s;hed with
&s;everal bitches in &s;ea&s;on: He di&s;covered neither
hatred nor love to them; and he died of chagrin
and melancholy a few months afterwards.</P>
<P>From the&s;e experiments we learn, that the
wolf and fox are very different in their natures
from the dog; that their &s;pecies are &s;o di&s;tinct
and remote from each other, as to prevent their
commixture, at lea&s;t in our climates; that, con|&s;equently,
the dog derives not his origin from
the wolf or the fox; and that the nomencla|tors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canis cauda &s;ini&s;tror&s;um recurvata, <HI>the dog.</HI> Canis cauda incurvata, <HI>the wolf.</HI> Canis cauda recta, apice albo, <HI>the fox. Linn. Sy&s;t. p</HI> 59.</NOTE>,

The congre&s;s was immediate, and as u&s;ual between dog and bitch: She produced ten pup|pies. I have &s;een one of them that had very much the re&s;em|blance of the wolf, and much of its nature: Being &s;lipped at a weak deer, it in&s;tantly caught at the animal's throat, and killed it.'&mdash;It is to be regretted, that Mr Pennant gives no in|formation as to the fertility or &s;terility of the&s;e mules.</NOTE>.
<PB N="28" REF="34">
In warm climates, there is a ferocious animal
which differs le&s;s from the dog than the wolf
or fox: This animal, called the <HI>Jackal,</HI> has
been well de&s;cribed by travellers. They are
very numerous in A&s;ia, and Africa, in the neigh|bourhood
of Trebi&s;ond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Gemell: Carreri, tom. 1. p. 419.</NOTE>, round Mount Cauca|&s;us,

Though this animal is con&s;idered by the natives
as a wild dog, yet, as it is doubtful whether they
intermix and produce together, we &s;hall treat of
the jackal, the wolf, and the dog, as &s;eparate
and di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>I pretend not ab&s;olutely to affirm, that the
jackal, or even the wolf and fox, in no age or
country, never intermixed with dogs. The
contrary is a&s;&s;erted po&s;itively by the antients.
Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. de generat. animal. lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE> remarks, that, though animals of
different &s;pecies intermingle &s;eldom; yet it cer|tainly
happens among dogs, foxes, and wolves:
He adds, that the Indian dogs proceed from an|other
&s;imilar wild bea&s;t and the dog. This wild
bea&s;t, to which he gives no name, is probably
<PB N="29" REF="35">
the jackal. But he ob&s;erves, in another place<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, hi&s;t. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</NOTE>,
that the Indian dogs proceed from a commix|ture
between the tiger and the bitch. This no|tion
is extremely improbable; beeau&s;e the tiger,
both in his form and di&s;po&s;itions, differs much
more from the dog than the wolf, the fox, or
the jackal. Ari&s;totle indeed appears to violate
his own argument; for, after telling us, that
the Indian dogs proceeded from a wild bea&s;t &s;i|milar
to the wolf or fox, he &s;ays afterwards,
that they proceed from the tiger, without men|tioning
whether this conjunction was made be|tween
the tiger and bitch, or between the dog
and tigre&s;s: He only adds, that the affair did
not &s;ucceed till the third trial; that the fir&s;t lit|ter
con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of tigers; that dogs were
chained in the de&s;erts, and, unle&s;s the tiger was
in &s;ea&s;on, they were often devoured; that the
great heat, and &s;carcity of water, made the pro|duction
of mon&s;ters and prodigies very frequent
in Africa, becau&s;e numbers of animals were o|bliged
to a&s;&s;emble in the &s;ame place in order to
drink, where they often grew familiar and cou|pled
together. All this &s;eems to be not only
conjectural and uncertain, but &s;u&s;picious, and
unworthy of credit; for, the more narrowly we
examine the nature of animals, we perceive that
in&s;tinct is the mo&s;t certain criterion for judging
of them. By the mo&s;t attentive in&s;pection of
their internal parts, we di&s;cov&eacute;r only &s;light dif|ferences.
<PB N="30" REF="36">
The hor&s;e and a&s;s, though perfectly
&s;imilar in their internal &s;tructure, are very dif|ferent
in their natures. The internal parts of
the bull, the ram, and the he-goat, are exactly
the &s;ame; yet they con&s;titute three &s;pecies more
remote from each other than the a&s;s and hor&s;e:
The &s;ame remark is applicable to the dog; the
fox, and the wolf. We derive more light from
in&s;pecting the external form. But as, in &s;pecies
which are not remote, there are, even external|ly,
more re&s;emblances than di&s;crepancies, this
in&s;pection is not &s;ufficient to determine whether
they belong to the &s;ame or to different &s;pecies.
In a word, when the &s;hades are &s;till lighter,
they mu&s;t be combined with the information
derived from in&s;tinct. It is from the di&s;po&s;itions
of animals that we ought to judge of their na|tures:
If we &s;uppo&s;e two animals perfectly &s;i|milar
in form, but very different in their di&s;po|&s;itions,
they would neither join nor produce to|gether,
but con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This mode of judging concerning the diffe|rences
of neighbouring &s;pecies, is the only one
that can be employed when we want to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the numerous varieties which take place
in the &s;ame &s;pecies. We know thirty fixed va|rieties
of dogs, though we certainly are not ac|quainted
with the whole. Of the&s;e thirty va|rieties,
there are &s;eventeen which ought to be a|&s;cribed
to the influence of climate, namely, the
&s;hepherd's dog, the Pomeranian dog, the Sibe|rian
<PB N="31" REF="37">
dog, the Iceland dog, the Lapland dog, the
Iri&s;h grey-hound, the common grey-hound, the
ma&s;tiff, the great Dani&s;h dog, the hound, the har|rier,
the terrier, the &s;paniel, the water dog, the
&s;mall Dani&s;h dog, the Turki&s;h dog, and the
bull-dog. The other thirteen, which are the
mongrel Turki&s;h dog, the grey-hound with hair
like an wolf, the &s;hock-dog, or lap-dog, the
ba&s;tard pug-dog, the pug-dog, the Calabrian,
Burgos, and Alicant dogs, the lion-dog, the
&s;mall water dog, the dog of Artois, and the
King Charles's dog, are nothing but mongrels
produced by the commixture of the above &s;even|teen
races; and, by tracing each of the&s;e mon|grels
back to the two races from which they
&s;prung, their natures will then be &s;ufficiently a|&s;certained.
But, if we want to know the rela|tions
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the fir&s;t &s;eventeen
races, we mu&s;t attend to their in&s;tincts, their
figure, and many other circum&s;tances. I have
put into one group the &s;hepherd's dog, the Po|meranian
dog, the Siberian dog, the Lapland and
Iceland dogs, becau&s;e a &s;tronger re&s;emblance
takes place between them than between any of
the other kinds, and becau&s;e all of them have
&s;harp muzzles like the fox, erect ears, and an
in&s;tinct which induces them to follow and pro|tect
flocks. The grey-hound, the large Dani&s;h
dog, and the Iri&s;h grey-hound have, be&s;ide their
&s;imilarity in figure and length of muzzle, the
&s;ame di&s;po&s;itions: They are found of running,
and of following hor&s;es and carriages. They
<PB N="32" REF="38">
have little &s;cent, and hunt rather by the eye
than the no&s;e. The hounds, the harriers, the
&s;paniels, the terriers, and the water-dogs, are the
true hunting dogs. Though they differ a little
in figure, they have all thick muzzles, and the
&s;ame in&s;tincts; and therefore they ought to be
ranked together. The &s;paniel, for example, has
been called by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, <HI>canis aviarius
terre&s;tris,</HI> and the water-dog, <HI>canis aviarius aqua|ticus.</HI>
The only difference in di&s;po&s;ition be|tween
the&s;e two dogs is, that the water-dog,
with his long, bu&s;hy-hair, takes the water more
chearfully than the others, who&s;e hair is &s;mooth
and &s;hort. La&s;tly, the &s;mall Dani&s;h dog and the
Turki&s;h dog mu&s;t be joined together, &s;ince the
latter is &s;aid to be the &s;ame dog with the former,
only deprived of his hair by the effects of heat.
There remains only the bull-dog, which, from
the &s;hortne&s;s of his muzzle, re&s;embles the little
Dani&s;h dog, but differs from him &s;o much, both
in figure and in&s;tinct, as to form a particular
variety. He &s;eems al&s;o to affect a particular
climate: He comes from Britain, and it is dif|ficult
to pre&s;erve the breed in France. The
mongrels that proceed from him, which are the
ma&s;tiff and the pug-dog, &s;ucceed better. All
the&s;e dogs have very &s;hort muzzles, little &s;cent,
and often &s;end forth a di&s;agreeable &s;mell. The
finene&s;s of &s;cent &s;eems to depend more on the
largene&s;s than the length of the muzzle; for
the grey-hound, the large Dani&s;h dog, and the
<PB N="33" REF="39">
Iri&s;h grey-hound, have le&s;s &s;cent than the hound,
the harrier, the tarrier, the &s;paniel, or the wa|ter-dog,
who have all, in proportion to their
&s;ize, &s;horter, but broader muzzles, than the for|mer.</P>
<P>The greater or le&s;&s;er perfection of the &s;en&s;es
forms not, in man, an eminent or remarkable
quality; but be&s;tows on the other animals all
their merit, and produces, as a cau&s;e, all the ta|lents
of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible. I mean not
to enumerate all the qualities of hunting dogs.
The &s;uperiority they po&s;&s;es over other animals,
by the excellence and acutene&s;s of their &s;en&s;e of
&s;melling, is well known. But details of this
kind are remotely connected with natural hi|&s;tory.
Be&s;ides, the artifices and dexterity,
though derived &s;olely from nature, employed
by wild animals to conceal them&s;elves, or to a|void
the pur&s;uit of the dogs, are perhaps more
worthy of admiration than the mo&s;t refined me|thodical
exhibitions derived from the art of
hunting.</P>
<P>The dog, like every other animal which pro|duces
above one or two at a time, is not perfect|ly
formed immediately after birth. Dogs are
commonly brought forth blind. The two eye|lids
are not &s;imply glued together, but &s;hut up
with a membrane, which is torn off as &s;oon as
the mu&s;cles of the upper eye-lid acquire &s;trength
&s;ufficient to overcome this ob&s;tacle to vi&s;ion,
which generally happens about the tenth or
<PB N="34" REF="40">
twelfth day. At this period, the bones of the
head are not completed, the body and muzzle are
turgid, and the whole figure is ill defined. But,
in le&s;s than two months, they learn to u&s;e all
their &s;en&s;es; their growth is rapid, and they &s;oon
acquire &s;trength. In the fourth month, they
lo&s;e &s;ome of their teeth, which, as in other ani|mals,
are &s;oon replaced, and never again fall
out. The number of teeth is forty-two, namely,
&s;ix cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw, and
fourteen grinders in the upper and twelve in
the under. But the number of grinders is
not uniform, being greater or le&s;s in particular
dogs. When very young, both males and fe|males
&s;quat down a little to void their urine:
In the ninth or tenth month, they begin to rai&s;e
the thigh, when they perform this operation;
and, at the &s;ame period, they acquire the capa|city
of procreating. The male is ready at all
times; but the female receives him only at cer|tain
fixed &s;ea&s;ons, which generally happen
twice a-year, and more frequently in winter
than in &s;ummer. The ardour of the female
continues ten, twelve, and &s;ometimes fifteen
days; and it is known by external &s;igns, which
appear &s;ome days before &s;he admits the male:
The parts become moi&s;t and prominent; and
this phaenomenon is always accompanied with
a &s;mall flux of blood. The male di&s;covers the
condition of the female by a peculiar &s;mell; but
&s;he &s;eldom receives him for the fir&s;t &s;ix or &s;even
<PB N="35" REF="41">
days. One embrace is &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to
make her conceiv&eacute; a great number of young;
but, when not re&s;trained, &s;he will admit &s;everal
dogs every day. She &s;eems to have no predi|lection,
excepting in favour of the large&s;t dogs,
without regarding their figure or beauty. Hence
it frequently happens, that a &s;mall female, who
has admitted a large male, dies in bringing forth
her young.</P>
<P>But a &s;ingularity in the&s;e animals, ari&s;ing from
the &s;tructure of their organs, they are incapable
of &s;eparating, after con&s;ummation, but are ob|liged
to remain united as long as the erection
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts. The dog, like &s;everal other animals,
has not only a bone in the penis, but, in the
middle of the corpus caverno&s;um, there is a large
hollow ring, which, in time of copulation, &s;wells
to a con&s;iderable &s;ize. The female, on the o|ther
hand, has a larger clitoris than perhaps any
other animal; be&s;ides, in the time of coition, a
large firm protuberance ari&s;es, and remains, per|haps,
longer than that of the male, and prevents
him from retiring till it &s;ub&s;ides; for, immedi|ately
after con&s;ummation, he changes his po&s;i|tion,
in order to repo&s;e on his four legs; his a|&s;pect
is melancholy, and the efforts for &s;epara|tion
never proceed from the female.</P>
<P>The time of ge&s;tation is nine weeks, or 63
days, &s;ometimes 62 or 61, but never le&s;s than
60. The females produce &s;ix, &s;even, and &s;ome|times
even twelve puppies. The large&s;t and
<PB N="36" REF="42">
talle&s;t are more prolific than the &s;maller kinds,
which often produce only four or five, and
&s;ometimes but one or two, e&s;pecially at the fir&s;t
litters, which, in all animals, are always le&s;s nu|merous
than the &s;ub&s;equent ones.</P>
<P>Dogs, though extremely ardent in their a|mours,
continue to propagate during life, which
is generally limited to fourteen or fifteen years,
though &s;ome have been known to live to the
age of twenty. The duration of life in the dog,
as in other animals, is proportioned to the
time of his growth, which is not comple|ted
in le&s;s than two years, and he lives four|teen.
His age may be di&s;covered by his teeth,
which, when young, are white, &s;harp, and point|ed:
But, as he increa&s;es in years, they become
black, blunt, and unequal. It may likewi&s;e be
known by the hair, which turns grey on the
muzzle, front, and round the eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, which are naturally vigilant,
active, and frolick&s;ome, by being over-fed in
our hou&s;es, become &s;o heavy and &s;lothful, that
they pa&s;s their lives in &s;leeping and eating. Their
&s;leep, which is almo&s;t perpetual, is accompanied
with dreams, which is perhaps a gentle mode of
exi&s;ting. They are naturally voracious; and yet
they can endure very long ab&s;tinence. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, we have
the hi&s;tory of a bitch, that, having been forgot
in a country-hou&s;e, lived forty days, without
any other nouri&s;hment than the wool of a ma|tre&s;s,
<PB N="37" REF="43">
which &s;he had torn to pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des. &s;ciences, ann&eacute;e 1706, p. 5.</NOTE> Water
&s;eems to be more nece&s;&s;ary to dogs than victuals;
for they drink often and very plentifully: It is
even a vulgar opinion, that, when they want
water too long, they become mad. It is al&s;o a
peculiarity in dogs, that they make great efforts,
and &s;eem to &s;uffer much pain, in voiding their
excrement. This happens not, as Ari&s;totle al|ledges<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. de partibus animal. lib. ult.</NOTE>,
becau&s;e their inte&s;tines become narrow|er
in approaching the anus. On the contrary,
it is certain, that, in the dog, as in other ani|mals,
the great inte&s;tines enlarge as they proceed
downward, and that the rectum is larger than
the colon. The dry temperament of this ani|mal,
and not the &s;trangulations of the colon,
which are too di&s;tant from the rectum, is &s;uffi|cient
to produce this effect.</P>
<P>To give a clear idea of the different kinds of
dogs, of their degeneration in particular climates,
and of the mixture of their races, I have &s;ub|joined
a table, or genealogical tree, in which all
the&s;e varieties may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. This
tree is drawn in the form of a geographical
chart, pre&s;erving as much as po&s;&s;ible the po&s;ition
of the different climates to which each variety
naturally belongs. The &s;hepherd's dog is the
root of the tree. This dog, when tran&s;ported
into Lapland, or other very cold climates, a&s;|&s;umes
an ugly appearance, and &s;hrinks into a
<PB N="38" REF="44">
&s;maller &s;ize. But, in Ru&s;&s;ia, Iceland, and Si|beria,
where the climate is le&s;s rigorous, and
the people a little more advanced in civilization,
he &s;eems to be better accompli&s;hed. The&s;e
changes are occa&s;ioned &s;olely by the influence
of tho&s;e climates, which produce no great alte|ration
in the figure of this dog; for, in each of
the&s;e climates, his ears are erect, his hair thick
and long, his a&s;pect wild, and he barks le&s;s fre|quently,
and in a different manner, than in more
favourable climates, where he acquires a finer
poli&s;h. The Iceland dog is the only one that
has not his ears entirely erect; for their extre|mities
are a little inclined; and Iceland, of all
the northern regions, has been longe&s;t inhabit|ed
by half civilized men.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;hepherd's dog, when brought into
temperate climates, and among a people perfect|ly
civilized, as Britain, France, Germany, whould,
by the mere influence of the climate, lo&s;e his
&s;avage a&s;pect, his erect ears, his rude, thick,
long hair, and a&s;&s;ume the figure of a bull-dog,
the hound, and the Iri&s;h grey-hound. The bull-dog
and Iri&s;h grey-hound have their ears &s;till
partly erect, and very much re&s;emble, both in
their manners and &s;anguinary temper, the dog
from which they derive their origin. The
hound is farthe&s;t removed from the &s;hepherd's
dog; for his ears are long and entirely pendu|lous.
The gentlene&s;s, docility, and even the ti|midity
of the hound, are proofs of his great de|generation,
<PB N="39" REF="45">
or rather of the great perfection he
has acquired by the long and careful education
be&s;towed on him by man.</P>
<P>The hound, the harrier, and the terrier, con|&s;titute
but one race; for, it has been remarked,
that, in the &s;ame litter, hounds, harriers, and
terriers, have been brought forth, though the
female hound had been covered by only one of
the&s;e three dogs. I have joined the common
harrier to the Dalmatian dog, or harrier of Ben|gal,
becau&s;e they differ only in having more or
fewer &s;pots on their coat. I have al&s;o linked
the turn&s;pit, or terrier with crooked legs, with
the common terrier; becau&s;e the defect in the
legs of the former has originally proceeded from
a di&s;ea&s;e &s;imilar to the rickets, with which &s;ome
individuals had been affected, and tran&s;mitted
the deformity to their de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>The hound, when tran&s;ported into Spain and
Barbary, where all animals have fine, long,
bu&s;hy hair, would be converted into the &s;paniel
and water-dog. The great and &s;mall &s;paniel,
which differ only in &s;ize, when brought into
Britain, have changed their white colour into
black, and become, by the influence of climate,
the great and little King Charles's dog: To the&s;e
may be joined the Pyrame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This dog, though very common in Britain, has no Engli&s;h name.</NOTE>, which is only a
King Charles's dog, black like the others, but
marked with red on the four legs, and a &s;pot of
<PB N="40" REF="46">
the &s;ame colour above each eye, and on the
muzzle.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h grey-hound, tran&s;ported to the
north, is become the great Dani&s;h dog; and,
when carried to the &s;outh, was converted into
the common grey-hound. The large&s;t grey-hounds
come from the Levant, tho&s;e of a &s;maller
&s;ize from Italy; and tho&s;e Italian grey-hounds,
carried into Britain, have been &s;till farther dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The great Dani&s;h dog, tran&s;ported into Ire|land,
the Ukraine, Tartary, Epirus, and Alba|nia,
has been changed into the Iri&s;h grey-hound,
which is the large&s;t of all dogs.</P>
<P>The bull-dog, tran&s;ported from Britain to
Denmark, is become the little Dani&s;h dog; and
the latter, brought into warm climates, has been
converted into the Turki&s;h dog. All the&s;e races,
with their varieties, have been produced by the
influence of cliamte, joined to the effects of
&s;helter, food, and education. The other dogs
are not pure races, but have proceeded from
commixtures of tho&s;e already de&s;cribed. I have
marked, in the table, by dotted lines, the double
origin of the&s;e mongrels.</P>
<P>The grey-hound, and Iri&s;h grey-hound, have
produced the mongrel grey-hound, called al&s;o
the grey-hound with wolf's hair. The muzzle
of this mongrel is le&s;s pointed than that of the
true grey-hound, which is very rare in France.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47">
The great Dani&s;h dog, and the large &s;paniel,
have produced the Calabrian dog, which is a
beautiful animal, with long bu&s;hy hair, and lar|ger
than the Iri&s;h grey-hound.</P>
<P>The &s;paniel and terrier have produced the dog
called <HI>Burgos.</HI></P>
<P>From the &s;paniel and little Dani&s;h dog, has
proceeded the lion-dog, which is now very rare.</P>
<P>The dogs with long, fine, cri&s;ped hair, called
the <HI>Bouffe</HI> dogs, and which are larger than the
water-dog, proceed from the &s;paniel and water-dog.</P>
<P>The little water-dog comes from the water-dog
and &s;mall &s;paniel.</P>
<P>From the bull-dog and Iri&s;h grey-hound, pro|ceeds
a mongrel called the <HI>ma&s;tiff,</HI> which is lar|ger
than the bull-dog, and re&s;embles the latter
more than the Iri&s;h grey-hound.</P>
<P>The pug-dog proceeds from the bull-dog and
&s;mall Dani&s;h dog.</P>
<P>All the&s;e dogs are &s;imple mongrels, and are
produced by the commixture of two pure races.
But there are other dogs, called <HI>double mongrels,</HI>
becau&s;e they proceed from the junction of a pure

mongrels,</HI> becau&s;e they are produced by two mixed
races. Of this kind are the Artois and I&s;lois
dogs, which are produced by the pug-dog and
the ba&s;tard pug-dog; to which may be added

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Mailly, of the academy of Dijon, well
known by &s;everal ingenious performances, com|municated
to me a fact, which merits a place in
the Natural hi&s;tory of the dog. The following
is an extract of his letter upon this &s;ubject, dated
October 6. 1772.</P>
<P>"The curate of Norges, near Dijon, had a
bitch, which, without either having ever been
pregnant, or delivered of puppies, had all the
&s;ymptoms which characteri&s;e the&s;e two &s;tates.
She came in &s;ea&s;on at the u&s;ual period; but
never had any connections with a male.
When the common term of ge&s;tation was fi|ni&s;hed,
her paps were di&s;tended with milk,
<PB N="43" REF="49">
without being irritated by any particular treat|ment;
for it is po&s;&s;ible to bring milk into the
dugs of animals by frequently chaffing them.
But, in this ca&s;e, every thing was the effect
of nature; and this bitch &s;uckled &s;ome young
puppies with which &s;he was furni&s;hed, and
for whom &s;he di&s;covered as much tenderne&s;s
and attention, as if &s;he had been their real
mother. All this I &s;aw with my eyes. But,
what is &s;till more &s;ingular, this &s;ame bitch, a|bout
three years ago, &s;uckled two young cats,
one of which participated &s;o much of the na|ture
of its nur&s;e, that its cries had more re|&s;emblance
to the barking of a dog, than to
the mewing of a cat."</P>
<P>If the production of milk, without impregna|tion,
were more frequent among quadrupeds,
it would make them analogous to female birds,
which lay eggs without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
male.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>OF THE VARIETIES OF DOGS.</HEAD>
<P>A few years ago, at the fair of Saint Germain,
there was a Siberian dog, which appeared to dif|fer
&s;o much from that repre&s;ented in Plate XXIX.
as to merit a &s;hort de&s;cription. It was covered
with long hair, hanging almo&s;t down to the
ground. At fir&s;t &s;ight, it re&s;embled a large lion-dog;
but its ears were erect, and much larger.
<PB N="44" REF="50">
Its colour was all white, and its length, from the
no&s;e to the extremity of the body, was 21 inches
and a half; and its height behind was 11 inches
nine lines, and 11 inches three lines before. The
eye was of a brown che&s;nut colour, and the end
of the no&s;e, as well as round the no&s;trils and
mouth, were black. The ears were bu&s;hy, of a
whiti&s;h yellow within, and yellow on the edges
and extremities. The long hair of its head part|ly
concealed the eyes, and fell down upon the
no&s;e. Its toes and claws were al&s;o hid by the
hair of its legs. The tail, which turned up like
that of the Pomeranian dog, was covered with
hair about &s;even or eight inches long. This is
certainly the roughe&s;t furred of all dogs.</P>
<P>Other dogs, brought to Paris by the Ru&s;&s;ians,
which they called <HI>Siberian dogs,</HI> belonged to a
very different race from the preceding. Both
male and female were about the &s;ize of an ordi|nary
grey-hound. The no&s;e was &s;harp, the ears
half erect, but bended a little in the middle.
They were not &s;lender, like the grey-hound,
but round and full below the belly. Their tail
was about eight or nine inches in length, pretty
thick, and obtu&s;e at the extremity. Their co|lour
was black, without any mixt&ugrave;re of white
hairs; but the female had a grey tuft on the
middle of the head, and the male a tuft of the
&s;ame colour at the end of the tail. They were
trouble&s;ome with their care&s;&s;es, and &s;o voracious
that they could never be &s;atiated. They were,
<PB N="45" REF="51">
at the &s;ame time, in&s;ufferably dirty, and perpe|tually
roaming about in que&s;t of food. Their
legs were tollerably hand&s;ome; but their feet
were large and broad, and their toes united by a
membrane. Their voice was very &s;trong; they
had no inclination to bite; they care&s;&s;ed every
per&s;on indi&s;criminately; and their vivacity was
inexpre&s;&s;ible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extracted from a letter of M. Pa&s;umot of the academy of Dijon, to M. de Buffon, dated March 2. 1775.</NOTE>. From this de&s;cription, it appears,
that the&s;e pretended Siberian dogs, are of the
&s;ame race with that I have called the Iceland dog,
who&s;e figure is engraven Plate XXX. which
exhibits a number of the characters mentioned in
the above delineation.</P>
<P>'I have made &s;ome inquiry,' &s;ays Mr Colin|&s;on,
'concerning the dogs of Siberia. Tho&s;e
which draw &s;leds and carts are of a middle &s;ize:
Their no&s;e is &s;harp, and their ears long and e|rect.
They carry their tail bended, &s;ome of
them like the wolf, and others like the fox;
and it is certain, that they copulate with wolves
and foxes. I &s;ee, from your experiments, that,
when the&s;e animals are confined, they will not
intermix; but, when at full liberty, they wil|lingly
come together. With regard to the dog
and wolf, I my&s;elf have &s;een them couple in
England. But I have never met with any per|&s;on
who &s;aw dogs and foxes intermingle.
However, from a kind I &s;aw produced from a
bitch, which had lived at freedom in the woods,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
I have no doubt that &s;he had been impregnated
by a fox. The pea&s;ants know this &s;pecies, and
di&s;tingui&s;h it by the name of the <HI>fox-dogs.</HI>'</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Greenland dogs are white; but
&s;ome of them are black, with very bu&s;hy hair.
They rather may be &s;aid to howl than bark;
and they are &s;tupid, and unfit for every &s;pecies
of hunting. They &s;erve, however, for dragging
&s;leds, to which they are yoked by fours and &s;ixes.
The Greenlanders eat the dog's fle&s;h, and make
garments of his &s;kin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dogs of Kamt&s;chatka are rude, and half
&s;avage, like their ma&s;ters. They are commonly
black or white, and more nimble and active than
our dogs. They are great eaters of fi&s;h, and
are u&s;ed for drawing &s;leds. In &s;ummer, they
have their liberty; but are collected together in
the month of October, for the purpo&s;e of draw|ing
the &s;leds; and, during winter, they are fed
with a kind of pa&s;te compo&s;ed of fi&s;h, which
is allowed to ferment in a ditch, and given to
them half boiled<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, it appears, that the Green|land
and Kamt&s;chatkan dogs, and perhaps tho&s;e
of other northern regions, have a greater re&s;em|blance
to the Iceland dog, than to any of the o|ther
races; for the above de&s;cription of the two
Ru&s;&s;ian dogs, as well as the notices concerning
tho&s;e of Greenland and Kamt&s;chatka, corre&s;pond
<PB N="47" REF="53">
very well, and may be equally applied to our
Iceland dog.</P>
<P>Though we have de&s;cribed all the varieties
which we could collect, there are &s;till &s;ome
which could not be procured. For example,
there is a race of wild dogs, of which I have &s;een
two individuals, but had not an opportunity of
either de&s;cribing or delineating them. The in|genious
and learned M. Aubry, curate of Saint
Louis, has often furni&s;hed us with animals of
which we had no knowledge. He informs us, that,
a few years ago, he &s;aw a dog, nearly of the &s;ize
of a &s;paniel, which had long hair, and a large
beard on its chin. This dog was produced from
parents of the &s;ame race with tho&s;e which had
formerly been &s;ent ot Lowis XIV. by M. le
Comte de Toulou&s;e. M. le Comte de La&s;&s;ai had
al&s;o &s;ome of the&s;e dogs; but I know not what
has become of this &s;ingular race.</P>
<P>With regard to the wild dogs, among which
there are different races, as well as among the do|me&s;tic
kinds, I have little to add to what I have
&s;aid in my original work. M. le Vicomte de
Querho&euml;nt has been &s;o obliging as to communi|cate
to me a note with regard to the wild dog
found in the environs of the Cape of Good Hope.
He remarks, 'That, at the Cape, there are nu|merous
packs of wild dogs, as large as our
large&s;t kinds, who&s;e &s;kin is marked with vari|ous
colours. They have erect ears, run with
great &s;wiftne&s;s, and have no fixed re&s;idence.
<PB N="48" REF="54">
They de&s;troy an incredible quantity of deer.
They are &s;eldom &s;lain, and very difficult to take
in &s;nares; for they have an aver&s;ion to ap|proach
any thing that has been touched by
man. As their young are &s;ometimes met with
in the woods, attempts have been made to ren|der
them dome&s;tic; but they are &s;o large, and
&s;o ferocious, that the&s;e attempts have always
been abortive.'</P>

<P>THE cat is an unfaithful dome&s;tic, and kept
only from the nece&s;&s;ity we find of oppo|&s;ing
him to other dome&s;tics &s;till more incommodi|ous,
and which cannot be hunted; for we make
no account of tho&s;e people, who, being fond of
all brutes, fooli&s;hly keep cats for their amu&s;e|ment.
Though the&s;e animals, when young, are
frolick&s;ome and beautiful, they po&s;&s;e&s;s, at the
<PB N="50" REF="78">
&s;ame time, an innate malice, and perver&s;e di&s;po|&s;ition,
which increa&s;e as they grow up, and
which education learns them to conceal, but not
to &s;ubdue. From determined robbers, the be&s;t
education can only convert them into flattering
thieves; for they have the &s;ame addre&s;s, &s;ubtlety
and de&s;ire of plunder. Like thieves, they know
how to conceal their &s;teps and their de&s;igns, to
watch opportunities, to catch the proper moment
for laying hold of their prey, to fly from pu|ni&s;hment,
and to remain at a di&s;tance till &s;ollici|ted
to return. They ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ume the habits of
&s;ociety, but never acquire its manners; for they
have only the appearance of attachment or
friend&s;hip. This di&s;ingenuity of character is
betrayed by the obliquity of their movements,
and the duplicity of their eyes. They never
look their be&s;t benefactor in the face; but, ei|ther
from di&s;tru&s;t or fal&s;ene&s;s, they approach him
by windings, in order to procure care&s;&s;es, in
which they have no other plea&s;ure than what a|ri&s;es
from flattering tho&s;e who be&s;tow them.
Very different from that faithful animal the dog,
who&s;e &s;entiments totally centre in the per&s;on and
happine&s;s of his ma&s;ter, the cat appears to have
no feelings which are not intere&s;ted, to have no
affection that is not conditional, and to carry on
no intercour&s;e with men, but in the view of
turning it to his own advantage. By the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions,
the cat has a greater relation to man
<PB N="51" REF="79">
than to the dog, in whom there is not the &s;mal|le&s;t
mark of in&s;incerity or unju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The form and temperament of the cat's body
perfectly accord with his temper and di&s;po&s;itions,
He is jolly, nimble, dexterous, cleanly, and vo|luptuous.
He loves ea&s;e, and choo&s;es the &s;oft|e&s;t
and warme&s;t &s;ituations for repo&s;e. He is
likewi&s;e extremely amorous, and, what is &s;ingu|lar
in the animal world, the female &s;eems to be
more ardent than the male. She not only in|vites
and goes in que&s;t of him, but announces,
by loud cries, the fury of her pa&s;&s;ion, or rather
the pre&s;&s;ure of her nece&s;&s;ities; and, when the
male di&s;dains her, or flies from her, &s;he pur&s;ues,
tears, and, though their embraces are always ac|companied
with the mo&s;t acute pain, compels
him to comply with her de&s;ires. This pa&s;&s;ion|ate
ardour of the female continues only nine or
ten days, and it happens generally twice a-year,
though often thrice, and even four times. The
period of ge&s;tation is 55 or 56 days, and four or
five are commonly produced at a litter. As the
male has an inclination to devour the young, the
female carefully conceals them; and, when ap|prehen&s;ive
of a di&s;covery, &s;he takes them up, one
by one, in her mouth, and hides them in holes,
and in places which are inacce&s;&s;ible. After &s;uck|ling
them a few weeks, &s;he pre&s;ents them with
mice, or young birds, to learn them to eat fle&s;h.
But, by an unaccountable caprice, the&s;e &s;ame
careful, tender, and affectionate mothers, &s;ome|times
<PB N="52" REF="80">
a&s;&s;ume an unnatural &s;pecies of cruelty, and
devour their own offspring.</P>
<P>Young cats are gay, vivacious, and frolick|&s;ome,
and, if nothing was to be apprehended
from their claws, would afford excellent amu&s;e|ment
to children. But their toying, though al|ways
light and agreeable, is never altogether in|nocent,
and is &s;oon converted into habitual ma|lice.
As their talents can only be exerted with
advantage again&s;t &s;mall animals, they lie in wait,
with great patience and per&s;everance, to &s;eize
birds, mice, and rats, and, without any in&s;truc|tion,
become more expert hunters than the be&s;t
trained dogs. Naturally aver&s;e to every kind
of re&s;traint, they are incapable of any &s;y&s;tem of
education. It is related, however, that the Greek
Monks of the i&s;land of Cyprus had trained cats
to hunt and de&s;troy &s;erpents, with which that
i&s;land was much infe&s;ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des i&s;les de l'Archipel, par Dapper, p. 51.</NOTE>. But this hunting
mu&s;t rather be a&s;cribed to their general de&s;ire
of &s;laughter, than to any kind of tractability or
obedience; for they delight in watching, attack|ing,
and de&s;troying all weak animals indi&s;crimi|nately,
as birds, young rabbits, hares, rats, mice,
bats, moles, frogs, toads, lizards, and &s;erpents.
They have not that docility and finene&s;s of &s;cent,
for which the dog is &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed.
They hunt only by the eye: Neither do they
properly pur&s;ue, but lie in wait, and attack ani|mals
by &s;urpri&s;e; and, after &s;porting with them,
<PB N="53" REF="81">
and tormenting them for a long time, they at
la&s;t kill them without any nece&s;&s;ity, and even
when well fed, purely to gratify their &s;angui|nary
appetite.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious phy&s;ical cau&s;e of their
watching and catching other animals by &s;urpri&s;e,
proceeds from the advantage they derive from
the peculiar &s;tructure of their eyes. In man
and mo&s;t other animals, the pupil is capable of a
certain degree of contraction and dilatation. It
enlarges a little when the light is faint, and con|tracts
when the light is too &s;plendid. But, in
cats and night birds, as the owls, &amp;c. the con|traction
and dilatation are &s;o great, that the pu|pil,
which is round in the dark, becomes, when
expo&s;ed to much light, long and narrow like a
line. Hence the&s;e animals &s;ee better in the
night than in the day. The pupil of the cat,
during the day, is perpetually contracted, and
it is only by a &s;trong effort that he can &s;ee with
a &s;trong light. But, in the twilight, the pupil
re&s;umes its natural roundne&s;s, the animal en|joys
perfect vi&s;ion, and takes advantage of this
&s;uperiority to di&s;cover and &s;urpri&s;e his prey.</P>
<P>Though cats live in our hou&s;es, they are not
entirely dome&s;tic. Even the tame&s;t cats are not
under the &s;malle&s;t &s;ubjection, but may rather be
&s;aid to enjoy perfect liberty; for they act only
to plea&s;e them&s;elves; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to re|tain
them a moment after they choo&s;e to go off.
Be&s;ides, mo&s;t cats are half wild. They know
<PB N="54" REF="82">
not their ma&s;ters, and only frequent barns, of|fices,
or kitchens, when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger.</P>
<P>Though greater numbers of them are reared
than of dogs, as they are &s;eldom &s;een, their num|ber
makes le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion on us. They contract
a &s;tronger attachment to our hou&s;es than to our
per&s;ons. When carried to the di&s;tance of a
league or two, they return of their own accord,
probably becau&s;e they are acquainted with all
the retreats of the mice, and all the pa&s;&s;ages and
outlets of the hou&s;e, and becau&s;e the labour of
returning is le&s;s than that which would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to acquire the &s;ame knowledge in a new
habitation. They have a natural antipathy at
water, cold, and bad &s;mells. They are fond of
ba&s;king in the &s;un, and of lying in warm places.
They are al&s;o fond of perfumes, and willingly
allow them&s;elves to be taken and care&s;&s;ed by
per&s;ons who carry aromatic &s;ub&s;tances. They
are &s;o delighted with valerian root, that it &s;eems
to throw them into a tran&s;port of plea&s;ure. To
pre&s;erve this plant in our gardens, we are under
the nece&s;&s;ity of fencing it round with a rail; for
the cats &s;mell it at a di&s;tance, collect about it in
numbers, and, by frequently rubbing, and pa&s;|&s;ing
and repa&s;&s;ing over it, they &s;oon de&s;troy the
plant.</P>
<P>Cats require fifteen or eighteen months before
they come to their full growth. In le&s;s than a
year, they are capable of procreating, and re|tain
this faculty during life, which extends not
<PB N="55" REF="83">
beyond nine or ten years. They are, however,
extremely hardy and vivacious, and are more
nervous than other animals which live longer.</P>
<P>Cats eat &s;lowly, and with difficulty: Their
teeth are &s;o &s;hort and ill placed, that they can
tear, but not grind their food. Hence they al|ways
prefer the mo&s;t tender victuals, as fi&s;hes,
which they devour either raw or boiled. They
drink frequently; their &s;leep is light; and they
often a&s;&s;ume the appearance of &s;leeping, when
they are only meditating mi&s;chief. They walk
&s;oftly, and without making any noi&s;e. As their
hair is always clean and dry, it is ea&s;ily electri|fied,
and the &s;parks become vi&s;ible when it is
rubbed acro&s;s with the hand in the dark. Their
eyes al&s;o &s;parkle in the dark like diamonds, and
&s;eem to throw out, in the night, the light they
imbibe during the day.</P>
<P>The wild cat couples with the dome&s;tic kind;
and, con&s;equently, they belong to the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.
It is not uncommon to &s;ee both males and
females quit their hou&s;es in the &s;ea&s;on of love,
go to the woods in que&s;t of wild cats, and after|wards
return to their former habitations. It is
for this rea&s;on that &s;ome dome&s;tic cats &s;o per|fectly
re&s;emble the wild cat. The only real dif|ference
is internal; for the inte&s;tines of the do|me&s;tic
cat are commonly much longer than tho&s;e
of the wild cat. The latter, however, is larger
and &s;tronger than the dome&s;tic kind; his lips
are always black; his ears are al&s;o &s;tiffer; his
<PB N="56" REF="84">
tail larger, and his colours more con&s;tant. In
this climate there is only one &s;pecies of wild
cat; and it appears from the te&s;timony of tra|vellers,
that this kind is found in all climates,
without being &s;ubject to much variety. They
exi&s;ted in America before its di&s;covery by the
Europeans. A hunter brought one of them to
Chri&s;topher Columbus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vie de Chri&s;t. Columb. part. 2. p. 167.</NOTE>, which was of an ordi|nary
&s;ize, of a browni&s;h grey colour, and having
a very long and &s;trong tail. They were like|wi&s;e
found in Peru<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 121.</NOTE>, though not in a dome&s;tic
&s;tate, and al&s;o in Canada<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Nouvelle France, par Charlevoix, tom. 3. p. 407.</NOTE>, in the country of the
Illinois, &amp;c. They have been &s;een in many
places of Africa, as in Guiney<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prevot, tom. 4. p. 230.</NOTE>, and the Gold
Coa&s;t; at Madaga&s;car<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Relation de Francois Cauche, p. 225.</NOTE>, where the natives keep
them in a dome&s;tic &s;tate; and at the Cape of
Good Hope<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap. par Kolbe, p. 49.</NOTE>, where M. Kolbe &s;ays there is
likewi&s;e a wild kind, of a blue colour; but they
are not numerous. The&s;e blue, or rather &s;late
coloured cats, are al&s;o found in A&s;ia. 'In Per&s;ia,'
&s;ays Pietro della Valle<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage, tom. 5. p. 98.</NOTE>, 'there is a &s;pecies of
cats which properly belong to the province of
Chorazan. Their figure and &s;ize are the &s;ame
with tho&s;e of the common cat. Their beauty
con&s;i&s;ts in the colour of their hair, which is
grey, and uniformly the &s;ame over the whole
body, excepting that it is darker on the back
<PB N="57" REF="85">
and head, and clearer on the brea&s;t and belly,
where it approaches to whitene&s;s, with that
agreeable mixture of clare-ob&s;cure, to u&s;e the
language of the painters, which has always a
wonderful effect. Be&s;ides, their hair is fine,
&s;hining, &s;oft as &s;ilk, and &s;o long, that, though
not frizled, it forms ringlets in &s;ome parts,
and particularly under the throat. The&s;e cats
are among other cats, what the water-dog is
among other dogs. The mo&s;t beautiful part
of the body is the tail, which is very long, and
covered with hair five or &s;ix inches in length.
They extend and turn it upon their backs,
like the &s;quirrel, the point re&s;embling a
plume of feathers. They are very tame; and
the Portugue&s;e have brought them from Per&s;ia
into India.' The &s;ame author adds, that he
had four couple of the&s;e cats, which he intend|ed
to bring to Italy. From this de&s;cription it
appears, that the Per&s;ian cats re&s;emble, in co|lour,
tho&s;e we call Chartreux cats, and that, ex|cepting
in colour, they have a perfect re&s;emblance
to the cat of Angora. It is probable, therefore,
that the cat of Chorazan in Per&s;ia, the cat of
Angora in Syria, and the Chartreux cat, con&s;ti|tute
but one race, who&s;e beauty proceeds from the
particular influence of the climate, as the Spani&s;h
cats, which are red, black, and white, owe their
beauty to the climate of Spain. It may be re|marked
in general, that, of all climates on the
habitable parts of the globe, tho&s;e of Spain and
<PB N="58" REF="86">
Syria are mo&s;t favourable to the production of
beautiful varieties in natural objects. In Spain
and Syria, the &s;heep, the goats, the dogs, the
cats, the rabbits, &amp;c. have the fine&s;t wool, the
mo&s;t beautiful and longe&s;t hair, and the mo&s;t a|greeable
and variegated colours. The&s;e climates,
it would appear, &s;often Nature, and embelli&s;h
the form of all animals.</P>
<P>The wild cat, like mo&s;t other animals in a &s;a|vage
&s;tate, has coar&s;e colours, and hard hair.
But, when rendered dome&s;tic, the hair &s;oftens,
the colours vary; and, in the favourable climates
of Chorazan and Syria, the hair grows long,
fine, and bu&s;hy; all the colours become more de|licate;
the black and red change into a &s;hining
brown, and the greyi&s;h brown is converted into
an a&s;h-coloured grey. By comparing the wild
cat with the Chartreux cat, it will be found,
that they differ only in this degradation in the
&s;hades of colour. As the&s;e animals have al|ways
more or le&s;s whitene&s;s on the &s;ides and
belly, it is apparent, that, to produce cats entire|ly
white and with long hair, like the cats of An|gora,
nothing farther is requi&s;ite, than to join
tho&s;e which have the greate&s;t quantity of white,
as has been done to procure white rabbits, dogs,
goats, &s;tags, &amp;c. In the Spani&s;h cat, which is
only another variety of the wild kind, the colours,
in&s;tead of being weakened by uniform &s;hades,
as in the cat of Syria, are exalted, and have be|come
more lively and brilliant; the yellow is
<PB N="59" REF="87">
changed into red, the brown into black, and the
grey into white. The&s;e cats, though tran&s;port|ed
into America, have not degenerated, but pre|&s;erve
their beautiful colours. 'In the Antilles,'
&s;ays Father Tertre, 'there are a number of cats,
which have probably been brought from Spain.
They are mo&s;tly marked with red, white, and
black. Several of our countrymen, after eat|ing
the fle&s;h, carry the &s;kins of the&s;e cats into
France. When we fir&s;t arrived at Guadaloupe,
the cats were &s;o accu&s;tomed to feed on par|tridges,
pigeons, thru&s;hes, and other &s;mall
birds, that they di&s;dained the rats; but, when
the game was much dimini&s;hed, they attacked
the rats with great fury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par. le. P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. In general,
cats are not &s;ubject, like dogs, to degeneration,
when tran&s;ported into warm climates. 'The
European cats,' Bo&s;man remarks, 'when car|ried
to Guiney, change not, like the dogs, but
pre&s;erve their original figure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Guin&eacute;e, par Bo&s;man, p. 2403.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. Their
nature is indeed more con&s;tant; and, as their do|me&s;tic
&s;tate is neither &s;o complete, &s;o univer&s;al,
nor, perhaps, &s;o antient as that of the dog, it is
not &s;urpri&s;ing that they are al&s;o le&s;s variegated.
Our dome&s;tic cats, though they differ in colour,
form no di&s;tinct races. The climates of Spain
and Syria have alone produced permanent varie|ties:
To the&s;e may be added the climate of
Pe-chi-ly in China, where the cats have long
<PB N="60" REF="88">
hair and pendulous ears, and are the favourites
of the ladies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Prevot, tom. 6. p. 10.</NOTE>. The&s;e dome&s;tic cats with pen|dulous
ears, of which we have full de&s;criptions,
are &s;till farther removed from the wild and pri|mitive
race, than tho&s;e who&s;e ears are erect.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here terminate the hi&s;tory of the cat,
and at the &s;ame time that of dome&s;tic animals.
The hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the ox, the &s;heep, the goat,
the hog, the dog, and the cat, are our only do|me&s;tic
animals. We add not to this li&s;t, the
camel, elephant, rain-deer, &amp;c. which, though
dome&s;tic in other countries, are &s;trangers to us;
and we &s;hall not treat of foreign animals, till
we have given the hi&s;tory of the wild animals
which are natives of our own climate. Be&s;ides,
as the cat may be con&s;idered as only half-do|me&s;tic,
he forms the &s;hade between dome&s;tic and
wild animals; for we ought not to rank among
dome&s;tics tho&s;e trouble&s;ome neighbours, mice,
rats, and moles, which, though they inhabit our
hou&s;es and gardens, are perfectly wild and free.
In&s;tead of being attached or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to man,
they fly from him, and pre&s;erve entire, in their
ob&s;cure retreats, their manners, their habits, and
their liberty.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, in the hi&s;tory of each dome&s;tic
animal, the great influence which education,
&s;helter, and the careful hand of man, have upon
the manners, di&s;po&s;itions, and even the form of
<PB N="61" REF="89">
animals. We have &s;een, that the&s;e cau&s;es, join|ed
to the effects of climate, modify and change
the &s;pecies to &s;uch a degree, as to make them
very different from what they are in a natural
&s;tate, and, at the &s;ame time, introduce &s;uch
changes among individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
that they would be regarded as different animals,
if they pre&s;erved not the faculty of intermixing
and producing fertile individuals, which is the
only e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of &s;pecies. We have
&s;een, that the different races of dome&s;tic ani|mals
ob&s;erve, in different climates, nearly the
&s;ame order as the races of the human kind;
that, like men, they are &s;tronger, larger, and
more courageous in cold countries, milder and
more civilized in temperate climates, and weak|er
and more deformed in very warm regions;
and that, in temperate climates, and among po|li&s;hed
people, the varieties of each &s;pecies are
mo&s;t numerous and diver&s;ified, and exhibit the
mo&s;t evident marks of the antiquity of their &s;la|very:
Pendulous ears, variegated colours, fine
long hair, are effects produced by their long
continuance in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. Mo&s;t wild a|nimals
have erect ears. The ears of the wild
boar are erect and &s;tiff; but tho&s;e of the dome|&s;tic
hog are inclined and half-pendulous. A|mong
the Laplanders, the &s;avages of America,
the Hottentots, the Negroes, and other unpoli&s;h|ed
people, all the dogs have erect ears; but they
are generally &s;oft and pendulous in Spain, France,
<PB N="62" REF="90">
Britain, Turkey, Per&s;ia, China, and other civi|lized
nations. The ears of the dome&s;tic cat are
not &s;o &s;tiff and erect as tho&s;e of the wild kind;
and in China, a nation which has been very long
in a &s;tate of civilization, and who&s;e climate is
mild, there are cats with pendulous ears. It is
for this rea&s;on, that the goat of Angora, who&s;e
ears are pendulous, &s;hould be regarded as a va|riety
farthe&s;t removed from the natural &s;tate.
The &s;trong and marked influence of the climate
of Syria, joined to the dome&s;tic condition of
the&s;e animals among a people very antiently
civilized, would, in the progre&s;s of time, pro|duce
this variety, which cannot be pre&s;erved in
any other climate. In the goats of Angora,
brought forth in France, the ears are neither &s;o
long nor &s;o pendulous as in tho&s;e of Syria, and
would probably, after a certain number of ge|nerations,
re&s;ume the ears and coar&s;e hair of our
common goat.</P>

<P>By mi&s;taking &s;ome of my expre&s;&s;ions in the
above hi&s;tory of the cat, I find it has been ima|gined
that I had denied him the power of &s;leep|ing
altogether. I always knew that cats &s;lept,
but not &s;o profoundly as I now find they &s;ome|times
do. On this &s;ubject M. Pa&s;umot, of the
<PB N="63" REF="91">
academy of Dijon, an able naturali&s;t, communi|cated
to me a letter, of which the following is
an extract.</P>
<P>'Permit me, Sir, to remark, that, in your
work, you &s;eem to deny the cat the power of
&s;leeping. I a&s;&s;ure you, that, though he &s;leeps
&s;eldom, his &s;leep is &s;o profound, that it is a
&s;pecies of lethargy, which I have ob&s;erved at
lea&s;t ten times in different cats. When young,
a favourite cat lay every night in bed at my
feet. One night, I pu&s;hed him from me; but
I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find him &s;o heavy, and at
the &s;ame time &s;o immoveable, that I believed
him to be dead. I pulled him &s;martly with
my hand; but I felt no motion. I then to&s;|&s;ed
him about, and, by the force of the agita|tion,
he began &s;lowly to awake. This pro|found
&s;leep, and difficulty of wakening, I have
frequently ob&s;erved. It generally happened in
the night, having only once ob&s;erved it in the
day; and this was after peru&s;ing what you have
&s;aid concerning the &s;leep of the&s;e animals. I
know another gentleman who has likewi&s;e of|ten
&s;een cats &s;leeping in this profound manner.
He tells me, that, when cats &s;leep during the
day, it is always at the time of the greate&s;t
heat, and particularly before the approach of
&s;tormy weather.'</P>
<P>M. de Le&s;tr&eacute;e, a merchant of Chalons in
Champagne, who is accu&s;tomed to allow cats to
lie in his bed, remarks:</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="92">
1. 'That, when the&s;e animals purr, when
they are tranquil, and appear to be &s;leeping,
they &s;ometimes make a long in&s;piration, which
is followed by a &s;trong expiration; and that,
at this period, their breath has an odour which
greatly re&s;embles that of mu&s;k.'</P>
<P>2. 'That, when &s;urpri&s;ed by a dog, or any
other object which &s;uddenly alarms them, they
make a kind of hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, which is accom|panied
with the &s;ame odour. This is not pe|culiar
to the males; for I have remarked the
&s;ame thing of both &s;exes, and of cats of all ages
and colours.'</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts, M. de Le&s;tr&eacute;e &s;eems to think,
that, in the brea&s;t or &s;tomach of the cat, there
are &s;ome ve&s;&s;els filled with an aromatic &s;ub&s;tance,
the perfume of which i&s;&s;ues from the mouth.
But we di&s;cover nothing of this kind from ana|tomy.</P>
<P>I formerly remarked, that, in China, there
were cats with pendulous ears. This variety is
not found any where el&s;e, and perhaps it is an
animal of a different &s;pecies; for travellers, when
mentioning an animal called <HI>Sumxu,</HI> which is
entirely dome&s;tic, &s;ay, that they can compare it
to nothing but the cat, with which it has a great
re&s;emblance. Its colour is black or yellow, and
its hair very bright and glittering. The Chine&s;e
put &s;ilver collars about the necks of the&s;e ani|mals,
and render them extremely familiar. As
they are not common, they give a high price,

<P>At Madaga&s;car there are al&s;o wild cats ren|dered
dome&s;tic. Mo&s;t of them have twi&s;ted

<P>Another variety has been ob&s;erved. In our
own climate, cats are &s;ometimes produced with
pencils of hair at the points of their ears. M.
de Seve writes me, (Nov. 16. 1773), that a young
cat was brought forth in his hou&s;e at Paris, of
the &s;ame race with that we have called the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
cat,</HI> with pencils at the points of its ears,

<HEAD>OF WILD ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the hi&s;tory of man, and of dome&s;tic animals,
we have &s;een Nature under re&s;traint, &s;eldom
per&s;ect, often changed and deformed, and per|petually
encompa&s;&s;ed with fetters, or loaded with
foreign ornaments. She is now to appear na|ked,
and adorned with &s;implicity alone; but
her attractions will be heightened by native beau|ty,
by the freedom of her demeanour, the &s;pright|line&s;s
of her movements, and other marks of
true dignity and independence. We are to &s;ee
her traver&s;ing the &s;urface of the earth, like a &s;o|vereign,
dividing her empire among the animals,
a&s;&s;igning to each his proper element, climate,
and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. We &s;hall &s;urvey her in the fo|re&s;ts,
in the waters, and in the plains, dictating
her &s;imple but immutable laws, impre&s;&s;ing upon
every &s;pecies indelible characters, di&s;pen&s;ing her
bounty with equity, compen&s;ating evil with
good, giving to &s;ome &s;trength and courage, ac|companied
with hunger and voracity; to others
gentlene&s;s, temperance, and agility, attended
with re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and timidity; and to all, liber|ty,
uniform manners, and ardour in love, which
is always ea&s;ily gratified, and always followed
with a happy fecundity.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="100">
Love and liberty are the mo&s;t ine&s;timable gifts
which Nature has to be&s;tow. Do the&s;e animals
we call <HI>wild,</HI> becau&s;e they are not &s;ubject to our
caprice, require more to render them completely
happy? But they al&s;o enjoy a perfect equality;
they are neither the &s;laves nor the tyrants of each
other. The individual has no occa&s;ion, like
man, to dread the re&s;t of his &s;pecies. They have
peace among them&s;elves, and war never ap|proaches
them, but from &s;trangers, or from man.
They have, therefore, great rea&s;on to fly from
the human race, to conceal them&s;elves from our
ob&s;ervation, to take up their abode in &s;olitudes
remote from the habitations of men, to provide
for their &s;afety by all the re&s;ources afforded them
by in&s;tinct, and to withdraw them&s;elves from
the power of man, u&s;ing, in every manner, that
liberty be&s;towed on them by Nature, at the &s;ame
time that &s;he has given them the de&s;ire of inde|pendence.</P>
<P>Some animals, and they are the mo&s;t gentle,
innocent, and tranquil, content them&s;elves with
retiring, and pa&s;&s;ing their lives in our fields.
Tho&s;e which are more fierce and &s;u&s;picious, hide
them&s;elves in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t.
Others, as if they knew there was no &s;afety on
the &s;urface of the earth, dig &s;ubterraneous a|bodes,
take refuge in caverns, or gain the &s;um|mits
of the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible mountains. La&s;tly,
the mo&s;t ferocious and formidable kinds, inha|bit
only de&s;erts, and reign as monarchs in tho&s;e
<PB N="68" REF="101">
burning climates, where man, equally &s;avage as
them&s;elves, is unable to conquer them.</P>
<P>As all beings, however free, are &s;ubjected to
phy&s;ical laws, and as the brute animals, as well
as man, feel the influences of the heavens and
the earth, it appears, that the &s;ame cau&s;es which
have &s;oftened and civilized the human &s;pecies in
our climates, have produced &s;imilar effects upon
every other &s;pecies. The wolf, which is per|haps
the mo&s;t ferocious animal in the Temperate
Zone, is not nearly &s;o terrible or &s;o cruel as the
tiger, the panther, and the lion of the Torrid
Zone, or the white bear, the lynx, and the hy|aena
of the Frozen Zone. This difference, as
if Nature, to give more harmony to her produc|tions,
had adapted the climate to the &s;pecies,
or the &s;pecies to the climate, is not only general,
but, in each particular &s;pecies, the climate is form|ed
for the manners, and the manners for the
climate.</P>
<P>In America, where the heat, under the &s;ame
latitudes, is le&s;s, and the air and earth &s;ofter than
in Africa, the tiger, the lion, the panther, have
nothing formidable but the name. They are no
longer tho&s;e tyrants of the fore&s;t, tho&s;e bold and
intrepid enemies of man, tho&s;e rapacious mon|&s;ters
which perpetually thir&s;t for blood and car|nage.
The&s;e animals, in America, generally fly
from man, and attack not other wilds bea&s;ts with
open force, but lie in wait to &s;urpri&s;e them:
They may even be &s;ubdued, and almo&s;t tamed.
Hence, if ferociou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty were natural
<PB N="69" REF="102">
to them, they mu&s;t have degenerated, or rather
felt the influence of climate. Under a mild cli|mate,
their nature has been &s;oftened; every ex|ce&s;s
of temper has been moderated; and tho&s;e
changes have only rendered them more con|formable
to the quality of the country they in|habit.</P>
<P>The vegetables which cover the earth, and are
more clo&s;ely connected with it than the animal
that feeds upon them, participate al&s;o more of
the nature of the climate. Every country, every
degree of temperature, has its peculiar plants.
At the foot of the Alps, we find the vegetables
of France and Italy, and, on their &s;ummit, tho&s;e
of the northern regions: We even meet with the
&s;ame plants on the frozen ridges of the African
mountains. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the mountains
which divide the Mogul empire from the king|dom
of Ca&s;hmire, we &s;ee all the Indian plants,
and we are &s;urpri&s;ed to find, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide,
nothing but the European kinds. Intemperate
climates likewi&s;e produce drugs, perfumes, poi|&s;ons,
and all vegetables who&s;e qualities are high|ly
exalted. The productions of temperate cli|mates,
on the contrary, are always mild: The
&s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t whole&s;ome herbs, the &s;weete&s;t
fruits, the gentle&s;t animals, and the mo&s;t poli&s;h|ed
men, are peculiar to tho&s;e happy climates.
Thus, the earth produces plants, the earth and
plants make animals, and the earth, plants, and
animals, give birth to man; for the qualities of
vegetables proceed immediately from the earth
<PB N="70" REF="103">
and the air; the temperature and other relative
qualities of herbivorous animals are derived from
the plants upon which they feed; and the phy|&s;ical
qualities of man, and other creatures which
are nouri&s;hed partly by fle&s;h and partly by plants,
depend, though more remotely, on the &s;ame
cau&s;es, who&s;e influence extends even to di&s;po|&s;itions
and manners. Figure and &s;ize, which ap|pear
to be ab&s;olute and determined qualities, de|pend,
however, like the relative qualities, upon
the influence of climate, and concur in proving
that every thing is moderate in temperate re|gions.
The &s;ize of our large&s;t quadrupeds have no
proportion to that of the elephant, the rhinoce|ros,
or hyppopotamus. Our large&s;t birds are
&s;mall, when compared with the o&s;trich, the con|dor,
or the ca&s;&s;awary; and what compari&s;on is
there between the fi&s;hes, the lizards, and the &s;er|pents
of our climates, with the whale, the wal|rus,
and manati, which people the northern &s;eas,
or the crocodiles, the large lizards, and the enor|mous
&s;erpents which infe&s;t the land and waters
of the &s;outh? And, if we examine each &s;pecies
in different climates, we &s;hall find &s;en&s;ible vari|eties
both in &s;ize and in figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the hi&s;tory of the hor&s;e, vol. III. p. 306.; goat, vol. III. p. 406.; hog, vol. III. p. 500.; and dog, vol. IV. p. 1.</NOTE>. The&s;e chan|ges
are produced in a &s;low and imperceptible
manner. Time is the great workman of nature.
He moves with regular and uniform &s;teps. He
performs no operation &s;uddenly; but, by de|grees,
<PB N="71" REF="104">
or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive impre&s;&s;ions, nothing can re|&s;i&s;t
his power; and tho&s;e changes which at fir&s;t
are imperceptible, become gradually &s;en&s;ible, and
at la&s;t are marked by re&s;ults too con&s;picuous to
be mi&s;apprehended.</P>
<P>Wild and free animals, without excepting
man, are, of all animated beings, lea&s;t &s;ubject to
changes or variations of any kind. As they are
at ab&s;olute liberty in the choice of their food and
their climate, their nature is more permanent
than that of dome&s;tic animals, which are en&s;laved,
tran&s;ported, maletreated, and fed, without con|&s;ulting
their inclination or ta&s;te. Wild animals
live perpetually in the &s;ame manner. They ne|ver
wander from climate to climate. The wood
where they are brought forth is a country to
which they are faithfully attached, and they ne|ver
depart from it, unle&s;s they perceive that they
can no longer live there in &s;afety. They fly not
&s;o much from their natural enemies, as from the
pre&s;ence of man. Nature has furni&s;hed them
with re&s;ources again&s;t the other animals, and put
them on a level; they know their &s;trength, their
addre&s;s, their de&s;igns, their haunts, and, if un|able
to avoid them, oppo&s;e force to force: In a
word, they are &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus. But
how can they defend them&s;elves again&s;t a being
who can &s;eize without &s;eeing, and kill without
approaching them?</P>
<P>It is man, therefore, who di&s;turbs and di&s;per&s;es
wild animals, and renders them a thou&s;and more
<PB N="72" REF="105">
&s;avage than they would naturally be; for mo&s;t
of them require only tranquility, and a moderate
u&s;e of the air and earth. Nature even teaches
them to live together, to unite into families, and
to form &s;ocieties. In countries not totally en|gro&s;&s;ed
by man, &s;ome ve&s;tiges of the&s;e &s;ocieties
&s;till remain. We there perceive common works
carried on, de&s;igns that, though not founded on
rea&s;on, appear to be projected upon rational con|ventions,
the execution of which &s;uppo&s;es union
at lea&s;t, and a joint co-operation of labour. It is
not by force or phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity, like the ants,
the bees, &amp;c. that the beavers labour and build
hou&s;es; for they are neither con&s;trained by &s;pace,
nor time, nor number, but unite from choice. Tho&s;e
which agree, dwell together; and tho&s;e which do
not agree, remove; and &s;ome of them have been
remarked which, being con&s;tantly repul&s;ed by
others, were obliged to betake them&s;elves to a
&s;olitary life. It is only in di&s;tant and de&s;ert
countries, where they dread not the approach of
man, that they incline to render their dwellings
more fixed and commodious, by con&s;tructing
hou&s;es, or a kind of villages, which have no
&s;mall re&s;emblance to the feeble and primitive ef|forts
of a na&s;cent republic. In countries, on
the contrary, &s;pread over by men, they carry
terror along with them. The &s;ociety of animals
is then at an end. All indu&s;try cea&s;es, and eve|ry
art is &s;tifled. They think no more of build|ing,
and neglect every conveniency. Perpetu|ally
<PB N="73" REF="106">
pre&s;&s;ed by fear and nece&s;&s;ity, their only de|&s;ire
is the bare pre&s;ervation of life, and their on|ly
occupation is flight and concealment. If the
human &s;pecies, as is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hall,
in the progre&s;s of time, people equally the whole
&s;urface of the earth, the hi&s;tory of the beaver, in
a few ages, will be regarded as a ridiculous
fable.</P>
<P>We may, therefore, conclude, that the talents
and faculties of animals, in&s;tead of augmenting,
are perpetually dimini&s;hing. Time fights again&s;t
them. The more the human &s;pecies multiplies
and improves, the more will the wild animals
feel the effects of a terrible and ab&s;olute tyrant,
who, hardly allowing them an individual exi&s;t|ence,
deprives them of liberty, of every a&s;&s;ocia|ting
principle, and de&s;troys the very rudiments of
their intelligence. What advances they have
made, or may &s;till make, conveys little informa|tion
of what they have been, or might acquire.
If the human &s;pecies were annihilated, to which
of the animals would the &s;ceptre of the earth
belong?</P>

<P>THE &s;tag is one of tho&s;e innocent, gentle,
and peaceable animals, which &s;eem to be
de&s;tined to embelli&s;h and animate the &s;olitudes
of the fore&s;t, and to occupy, at a di&s;tance from
man, the tranquil retreats of tho&s;e gardens
of nature. The elegance and lightne&s;s of his
<PB N="75" REF="108">
figure, the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;tature, the
flexibility and nervou&s;ne&s;s of his limbs, his gran|deur,
&s;trength, and &s;wiftne&s;s, and his head, which
is rather adorned than armed with living bran|ches,
that, like the leaves of trees, are annually
renewed, &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h him from the o|ther
inhabitants of the wood. As he is al&s;o the
noble&s;t of the&s;e animals, he mini&s;ters to the plea|&s;ure,
and has occupied the lei&s;ure, of the great|e&s;t
heroes. The exerci&s;e of the chace &s;hould
always &s;ucceed, or rather precede, the fatigues
of war. To know the management of hor&s;es
and arms, are talents common to the warrior
and the hunter. To be accu&s;tomed to fatigue,
addre&s;s, dexterity, and quickne&s;s of movement,
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of courage, are qua|lities
acquired in the chace, and extremely u&s;e|ful
in battle. Hunting is a mo&s;t delightful
&s;chool of a nece&s;&s;ary art. It is the only amu&s;e|ment
which entirely dive&s;ts us of care, the only
recreation that is not accompanied with effemi|nacy,
and gives vivacity and plea&s;ure, without
languor or di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>How can men, who, from their &s;ituation in
life, are perpetually harra&s;&s;ed with company, be
better employed than in hunting? Always &s;ur|rounded
with a multitude, tea&s;ed with the im|portunity
of their demands, obliged to give their
attention to affairs which are foreign to them,
agitated by the &s;olicitations of men of high rank,
and con&s;trained and fettered in proportion to
<PB N="76" REF="109">
their elevation, great men would feel only the
weight of their own grandeur, and exi&s;t only
for others, if they did not occa&s;ionally ab&s;tract
them&s;elves from a croud of para&s;ites and flatter|ers.
To pre&s;erve &s;elf-enjoyment, to recal per|&s;onal
attachments, and receive private friend|&s;hip,
&s;entiments a thou&s;and times more precious
and intere&s;ting than all the ideas of grandeur,
retirement from the tumult and bu&s;ine&s;s of the
world is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary; and what retire|ment
can be more various and animated than the
chace? what exerci&s;e more u&s;eful to the body?
what amu&s;ement more agreeable to the mind?</P>
<P>Perpetual action, or intercour&s;e with man, is
equally painful as perpetual thinking. Nature
never intended man for the contemplation of
ab&s;tract &s;ubjects. To be occupied, without re|laxation,
in difficult &s;tudies, to lead a &s;edentary
life, and to make the clo&s;et the centre of our ex|i&s;tence,
is equally unnatural as to pa&s;s our days
in tumult and agitation, continually drawn along
by the movements of other men, and obliged to
keep a jealous and con&s;trained watch over our
own conduct, looks, and ge&s;tures. Whatever
ideas we may conceive of the dignity of human
nature, it is apparent, that public exhibition is
not exi&s;tence, and that we are le&s;s fitted for
thinking than for action, for rea&s;oning than en|joyment.
True plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in the unre|&s;trained
u&s;e of our&s;elves. Our be&s;t gifts are
tho&s;e we receive from Nature. She pre&s;ents us
<PB N="77" REF="110">
with the u&s;eful and inexhau&s;tible enjoyments
which ari&s;e from the air, the earth, the fields,
and the fore&s;ts. Hence a ta&s;te for hunting,
fi&s;hing, gardening, and agriculture, is natural to
all men: And, in &s;ocieties le&s;s complicated than
ours, there are only two ranks, both of them
connected with this mode of life; the Nobles,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is arms and hunting; and the
Vulgar, who are occupied in cultivating the
earth.</P>
<P>In poli&s;hed &s;ocieties, where every thing is im|proved
and brought nearer perfection, to render
hunting more delightful and &s;prightly, to ennoble
this mo&s;t beneficial and re&s;pectable of all exer|ci&s;es,
it has been formed into an art. The chace
of the &s;tag requires a &s;pecies of knowledge,
which can only be learned by experience: It
implies a royal a&s;&s;emblage of men, hor&s;es, and
dogs, all &s;o trained, practi&s;ed, and di&s;ciplined,
that their movements, their re&s;earches, and their
&s;kill, mu&s;t concur in producing one common
end. The hunt&s;man &s;hould know the age and
the &s;ex of the animal; he &s;hould be able to di|&s;tingui&s;h
with preci&s;ion, whether the &s;tag he
has <HI>harboured</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To harbour</HI> a &s;tag, is to go round the place in which he has taken refuge, and to learn whether he has not e&s;caped.</NOTE> with his hound be a <HI>knobber</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Knobber</HI> is a &s;tag after he pa&s;&s;es his fir&s;t year till he arrives at the third.</NOTE>,

the excrement. The <HI>foot</HI> of the &s;tag is better
formed than that of the hind, or female. Her
<HI>leg</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the language of hunters, <HI>leg</HI> means the two bones be|hind the foot, which make an impre&s;&s;ion on the ground along with the foot.</NOTE> is more gro&s;s and nearer the heel. The
impre&s;&s;ions of his feet are rounder, and farther
removed from each other. He moves more re|gularly,
and brings the hind foot into the im|pre&s;&s;ion
made by the fore foot. But the di|&s;tance
between the &s;teps of the hind are &s;horter,
and her hind feet &s;trike not &s;o regularly the
track of the fore feet. As &s;oon as the &s;tag ac|quires
his fourth horns, he is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h|ed;
but, to know the <HI>foot</HI> of a young &s;tag from
that of a hind, requires repeated experience.
Stags of &s;ix, &s;even, &amp;c. years, are &s;till more
ea&s;ily known; for their fore foot is much lar|ger
than the hind foot; the older they are, the
&s;ides of their feet are the more worn<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This mark is equivocal; for the wearing of the hoof de|pends much on the plainne&s;s or roughne&s;s of the country which the animals frequent.</NOTE>; the
di&s;tance of their &s;teps are more regular than
tho&s;e of young &s;tags; they always place their
hind foot exactly in the track of the fore foot,
excepting, when they &s;hed their horns, the old

&s;tags <HI>mi&s;place</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To mi&s;place,</HI> is to put the hind foot out of the track of the fore foot.</NOTE>, at this &s;ea&s;on, nearly as often
as the young ones; but in this they are more
regular than the hind or young &s;tag, placing the
hind foot always at the &s;ide of the fore foot,
and never beyond or within it.</P>
<P>When the hunt&s;man, from the dryne&s;s of the
&s;ea&s;on, or other circum&s;tances, cannot judge by
the foot, he is obliged to trace the animal back|wards,
and endeavour to find his dung. This
mark requires, perhaps, greater experience than
the knowledge of the foot; but, without it, the
hunt&s;man would be unable to give a proper re|port
to the company. After the report of the
hunt&s;man, and the dogs are led to the refuge of the
&s;tag, he ought to encourage his hound, and make
him re&s;t upon the track of the &s;tag till the animal
be unharboured. In&s;tantly the alarm is given to
uncouple the dogs, which ought to be enlivened
by the voice and the horn of the hunt&s;man. He
&s;hould al&s;o diligently ob&s;erve the foot of the &s;tag,
in order to di&s;cover whether the animal has
&s;tarted, and &s;ub&s;tituted another in his place. But
it is then the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hunters to &s;epa|rate
al&s;o, and to recall the dogs which have gone
a&s;tray after fal&s;e game. The hunt&s;man &s;hould
always accompany his dogs, and encourage, with|out
pre&s;&s;ing them too hard. He &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t
them in detecting all the arts of e&s;cape u&s;ed
by the &s;tag; for this animal has remarkable
<PB N="80" REF="113">
addre&s;s in deceiving the dogs. With this view,
he often returns twice or thrice upon his former
&s;teps; he endeavours to rai&s;e hinds or younger
&s;tags to accompany him, and draw off the dogs
from the object of their pur&s;uit: He then flies
with redoubled &s;peed, or &s;prings off at &s;ide, lies
down on his belly, and conceals him&s;elf. In
this ca&s;e, when the dogs have lo&s;t his foot, the
hunt&s;men, by going backwards and forwards,
a&s;&s;i&s;t them in recovering it. But, if they cannot
find it, they &s;uppo&s;e that he is re&s;ting within
the circuit they have made, and go in que&s;t of
him. But, if they are &s;till unable to di&s;cover him,
there is no other method left, but, from view|ing
the country, to conjecture where he may
have taken refuge, and repair to the place. As
&s;oon as they have recovered his foot, and put the
dogs upon the track, they pur&s;ue with more ad|vantage,
becau&s;e they perceive that the &s;tag is
fatigued. Their ardour augments in proportion
to his feeblene&s;s; and their &s;cent becomes more
di&s;tinct as the animal grows warm. Hence they
redouble their cries and their &s;peed; and, though
the &s;tag practi&s;es &s;till more arts of e&s;cape than
formerly, as his &s;wiftne&s;s is dimini&s;hed, his arts
and doublings become gradually le&s;s effectual.
He has now no other re&s;ource but to fly from
the earth which he treads, and get into the waters,
in order to cut off the &s;cent from the dogs. The
hunt&s;men go round the&s;e waters, and again put
the dogs on the track of his foot. The &s;tag, af|ter
<PB N="81" REF="114">
taking to the water, is incapable of running
far, and is &s;oon <HI>at bay</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a &s;tag is worn out with fatigue, he turns upon the hounds, and is &s;aid to be <HI>at bay.</HI></NOTE> But he &s;till attempts
to defend his life, and often wounds the dogs,
and even the hunt&s;men when too forward, by
blows with his horns, till one of them cuts his
hams to make him fall, and then puts an end to
his life by a blow of a hanger. They now ce|lebrate
the death of the &s;tag by a flouri&s;h of their
horns; the dogs are allowed to trample upon
him, and at la&s;t partake richly of the victory by
devouring his fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Every &s;ea&s;on is not equally proper for hunt|ing
the &s;tag with hounds. In &s;pring, when the
leaves begin to unfold and to adorn the fore&s;ts,
when the earth is covered with fre&s;h herbage
and flowers, their perfumes dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;a|tion
of the dogs; and, as the &s;tag is then in his
greate&s;t vigour, it is extremely difficult for them
to come up with him. It is likewi&s;e a &s;ettled
point among hunters, that, when the hinds are
about to bring forth, the chace is mo&s;t difficult,
and that, at this period, the dogs often quit a fa|tigued
&s;tag, and pur&s;ue any hind which bounds
before them. In the &s;ame manner, in the begin|ning
of autumn, when the rutting &s;ea&s;on commen|ces,
the hounds hunt without ardour: The &s;trong
odour of love renders, perhaps, the &s;cent more un|intere&s;ting;
and, perhaps, at this &s;ea&s;on, the odour
of all &s;tags is nearly the &s;ame. During the winter
<PB N="82" REF="115">
&s;nows, it is al&s;o improper to hunt the &s;tag; be|cau&s;e
the hounds have no acutene&s;s of &s;cent, and
&s;eem to pur&s;ue the foot rather by the eye than
the no&s;e. As, in this &s;ea&s;on, the &s;tags find not
&s;ufficient nouri&s;hment in their retreats, they i&s;|&s;ue
forth into the more open parts of the coun|try,
and even into the &s;own fields. They a&s;|&s;emble
in flocks in the month of December, and,
when the fro&s;ts are &s;evere, they &s;eek &s;helter on
the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, or in covered places, where they
lock them&s;elves fa&s;t together, and acquire warmth
by mutual re&s;piration. When the rigours of
winter decline, they frequent the borders of the
fore&s;t, and make depredations on the ri&s;ing
wheat. In &s;pring, they &s;hed their horns, which
fall off &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or by rubbing them gently
again&s;t the branches of trees. It is &s;eldom that
both horns fall off at the &s;ame time, the one ge|nerally
preceding the other a day or two. The
old &s;tags ca&s;t their horns fir&s;t, which happens a|bout
the end of February or beginning of March.
An aged &s;tag, or one in his &s;eventh year or up|wards,
does not ca&s;t his horns before the middle
of March; a &s;tag of &s;ix years &s;heds his horns
in April; young &s;tags, or tho&s;e from three to
five years old, &s;hed their horns in the beginning,
and tho&s;e which are in their &s;econd year, not till
the middle or end of May. But, in all this there
is much variety; for old &s;tags &s;ometimes ca&s;t
their horns &s;ooner than tho&s;e which are young|er.
Be&s;ides, the &s;hedding of the horns is ad|vanced
<PB N="83" REF="116">
by a mild, and retarded by a &s;evere and
long winter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;tags ca&s;t their horns, they &s;e|parate
from each other, the young ones only
keeping together. They no longer haunt the
deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, but advance in|to
the cultivated country, and remain among
bru&s;hwood during the &s;ummer, till their horns
are renewed. In this &s;ea&s;on, they walk with
their heads low to prevent their horns from
rubbing again&s;t the branches; for they con|tinue
to have &s;en&s;ibility till they acquire their
full growth. The horns of the olde&s;t &s;tags are
not half completed in the middle of May, and
acquire their full length and hardne&s;s before the
end of July. Tho&s;e of the younger &s;tags are
proportionally later both in &s;hedding and being
renewed. But, as &s;oon as they have acquired
their full dimen&s;ions and &s;olidity, the &s;tags rub
them again&s;t the trees, in order to clear them of
a &s;kin with which they are covered: And, as
they continue this friction for &s;everal days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively,
it is &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le nouveau trait&eacute; de la venerie, p. 27.</NOTE>, that the horns retain the
colour peculiar to the juices of the trees again&s;t
which they have been rubbed; that they become
red when rubbed again&s;t beeches and birches,
brown again&s;t oaks, and black again&s;t elms and
trembling poplars. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that the
horns of young &s;tags, which are &s;moother, take
not &s;o deep a tincture from the trees as tho&s;e of
<PB N="84" REF="117">
old &s;tags, which are rougher, and clo&s;er cover|ed
with little prominences; becau&s;e it is tho&s;e
prominences which retain the coloured juices of
the trees. But I cannot believe that this is the
true cau&s;e; for I have kept tamed &s;tags in an
inclo&s;ure where there was not a &s;ingle tree, and
yet their horns were coloured in the &s;ame man|ner
as in tho&s;e which inhabit the fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;tags have poli&s;hed their horns,
they begin to feel the impre&s;&s;ions of love. To|wards
the end of Augu&s;t or beginning of Sep|tember,
they leave the coppice, return to the
fore&s;ts, and &s;earch for the hinds. They cry with
a loud voice; their neck and throat &s;well; they
become perfectly re&s;tle&s;s, and traver&s;e, in open
day, the fields and the fallow grounds; they
&s;trike their horns again&s;t trees and hedges; in a
word, they &s;eem to be tran&s;ported with fury, and
run from country to country till they find the
hinds or females, whom they pur&s;ue and compel
into compliance; for the female at fir&s;t avoids
and flies from the male, and never &s;ubmits to his
embraces till &s;he be fatigued with the pur&s;uit.
The old hinds likewi&s;e come in &s;ea&s;on before the
younger ones. When two &s;tags approach the
&s;ame hind, they mu&s;t fight before they enjoy.
If nearly equal in &s;trength, they threaten, paw
the ground, &s;et up terrible cries, and attack each
other with &s;uch fury, that they often inflict mortal
wounds with the &s;trokes of their horns. The
combat never terminates but in the defeat or
<PB N="85" REF="118">
flight of one of the rivals. The conqueror
lo&s;es not a moment in enjoying his victory, un|le&s;s
another rival approaches, whom he is again
obliged to attack and repel. The olde&s;t &s;tags
are always ma&s;ters of the field; becau&s;e they are
&s;tronger and more furious than the young ones,
who mu&s;t wait patiently till their &s;uperiors tire,
and quit their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Sometimes, however,
the young &s;tags accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es when
the old ones are fighting, and, after a ha&s;ty gra|tification,
fly off. The hinds prefer the old &s;tags,
not becau&s;e they are mo&s;t courageous, but be|cau&s;e
they are much more ardent. They are
likewi&s;e more incon&s;tant, having often &s;everal
females at a time; and, when a &s;tag has but one
hind, his attachment to her does not continue
above a few days: He then leaves her, goes in
que&s;t of another, with whom he remains a &s;till
&s;horter time; and, in this manner, pa&s;&s;es from
one to another, till he is perfectly exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>This ardour of love la&s;ts only three weeks,
during which the &s;tags take very little food, and
neither &s;leep nor re&s;t. Night and day, they are
either walking, running, fighting, or enjoying
the hinds. Hence, at the end of the rutting
&s;ea&s;on, they are &s;o meagre and exhau&s;ted, that
they recover not their &s;trength for a con&s;iderable
time. They generally retire to the borders of
the fore&s;ts, feed upon the cultivated fields, where
they find plenty of nouri&s;hment, and remain
there till their &s;trength is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. The
<PB N="86" REF="119">
rutting &s;ea&s;on of old &s;tags commences about
the beginning, and ends about the 20th day
of September. In tho&s;e of &s;ix or &s;even years
old, it begins about the 10th of Septem|ber,
and concludes in the beginning of Octo|ber.
In young &s;tags, or tho&s;e in their third,
fourth, or fifth year, it begins about the 20th of
September, and terminates about the 15th of
October; and, at the end of October, the rut|ting
is all over, excepting among the <HI>prickets,</HI> or
tho&s;e which have entered into their &s;econd year;
becau&s;e they, like the young hinds, are late&s;t of
coming into &s;ea&s;on. Hence, at the beginning
of November, the &s;ea&s;on of love is entirely fini&s;h|ed;
and the &s;tags, during this period of weak|ne&s;s
and la&s;&s;itude, are ea&s;ily hunted down. In
&s;ea&s;ons when acorns and other nuts are plenti|ful,
the &s;tags &s;oon recover their &s;trength, and a
&s;econd rutting frequently happens at the end of
October; but it is of much &s;horter duration than
the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In climates warmer than that of France, the
rutting time, like the &s;ea&s;ons, is more forward.
Ari&s;totle informs us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;tot. Hi&s;t. animal. lib. 6. c. 29.</NOTE>, that, in Greece, it com|mences
in the beginning of Augu&s;t, and termi|nates
about the end of September. The hinds
go with young eight months and &s;ome days,
and &s;eldom produce more than one fawn. They
bring forth in May or the beginning of June,
and &s;o anxiou&s;ly conceal their fawns, that they
often expo&s;e them&s;elves to be chaced, with a
<PB N="87" REF="120">
view to draw off the dogs, and afterwards return
to take care of their young. All hinds are not
fertile; for &s;ome of them never conceive. The&s;e
barren hinds are gro&s;&s;er and fatter than tho&s;e
which are prolific, and al&s;o come &s;oone&s;t in &s;ea|&s;on.
Some hinds are &s;aid to have horns like
the &s;tag, which is not altogether improbable.
The young are not called <HI>fawns</HI> or <HI>calves</HI> after
the &s;ixth month: The knobs of their horns then
begin to appear, and they take the name of
<HI>knobbers</HI> till their horns lengthen into <HI>&s;pears,</HI> and
then they are called <HI>brocks</HI> or <HI>&s;taggards.</HI> During
the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, they never leave their mothers.
In winter, the &s;tags and hinds, of all ages, keep
together in flocks, which are always more nu|merous
in proportion to the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on.
They &s;eparate in &s;pring: The hinds retire to
bring forth; and, during this period, the flocks
con&s;i&s;t only of knobbers and young &s;tags. In
general, the &s;tags are inclined to a&s;&s;ociate, and
nothing but fear or nece&s;&s;ity obliges them to
di&s;per&s;e. The &s;tag is capable of generating at
the age of eighteen months: Tho&s;e brought
forth during the &s;pring of the preceding year,
cover the hinds in autumn; and it is pre&s;ume|able
that the&s;e embraces are prolific. The fol|lowing
circum&s;tances, however, may render this
opinion doubtful: The &s;tags have not then ac|quired
above a half or two thirds of their growth,
which is not completed till the eighth year of
their age; and their horns continue to increa&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="121">
during the &s;ame period. But it ought to be re|marked,
that the fawn &s;oon gathers &s;trength;
that, during the fir&s;t, and even the &s;econd year,
his growth is very quick; and that he has al|ready
a redundance of nouri&s;hment, becau&s;e his
horns are con&s;iderably long, which is the mo&s;t
certain mark of ability to impregnate. It is al|lowed,
that animals, in general, are not capable
of procreating till they have nearly acquired
their full growth. But tho&s;e which have fixed
&s;ea&s;ons for rutting or &s;pawning, &s;eem not to ob|&s;erve
this law. Fi&s;hes &s;pawn and are prolific be|fore
they have attained a fourth, or even an
eighth part of their growth; and, among qua|drupeds,
tho&s;e which, like the deer-hind, have
determined &s;ea&s;ons for rutting, procreate earlier
than other animals.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many relations between the nu|trition,
the production of the horns, the rutting,
and the generation of the&s;e animals, that, to have
a clear conception of the particular effects which
re&s;ult from them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give a gene|ral
recapitulation of what I formerly advanced
on the &s;ubject of reproduction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. chap. 2. 3. 4.</NOTE>. Generation
depends &s;olely on a redundance of nouri&s;hment.
During the growth of an animal, which is al|ways
mo&s;t rapid in infancy, the nouri&s;hment is
entirely exhau&s;ted in the exten&s;ion and deve|lopement
of the body. Hence there is no re|dundance,
con&s;equently no production or &s;ecre|tion
<PB N="89" REF="122">
of &s;eminal fluid, and, of cour&s;e, young ani|mals
are incapable of procreation. But, when
they have attained the greate&s;t part of their
growth, the redundance of nouri&s;hment begins
to manife&s;t it&s;elf by new productions. In man,
the beard, the hair, the prominency of the brea&s;ts,
and the expan&s;ion of the organs of generation,
appear at the age of puberty. In the brute cre|ation;
and particularly in the &s;tag, this redun|dance
produces effects &s;till more remarkable, as
the growth of the horns, the &s;welling of the te&s;ti|cles,
the turgidity of the neck and throat, the fat,
the rutting, &amp;c. And, as the growth of the &s;tag
is at fir&s;t very rapid, only a year pa&s;&s;es before the
redundance of nouri&s;hment begins to &s;how it&s;elf
by the production of horns: If brought forth
in May, the rudiments of the horns appear in
the &s;ame month of the following year; and they
continue to lengthen and acquire &s;olidity, in pro|portion
to the quantity of nouri&s;hment taken by
the animal. About the end of Augu&s;t, they are
fully grown, and &s;o den&s;e and in&s;en&s;ible, that
the animal rubs them again&s;t the trees, in order
to deprive them of the &s;kin or &s;curf with which
they are covered. At the &s;ame time, the fat,
which is likewi&s;e produced by the redundance of
nouri&s;hment, cea&s;es to accumulate, and begins
to be determined toward the organs of genera|tion,
and to excite in the &s;tag that ardour of de|&s;ire
which renders him perfectly furious. That
the production of horns, and the &s;ecretion of
&s;emen depend on the &s;ame cau&s;e, is evident
<PB N="90" REF="123">
from this fact, that, when the organs nece&s;|&s;ary
for the &s;ecretion of &s;emen are de&s;troy|ed
by ca&s;tration, the production of the horns
is likewi&s;e prevented; for, if this operation
is performed after the horns are &s;hed, they
are never renewed; and if, on the contrary,
it is done when the horns are perfect, they
never fall off. In a word, after ca&s;tration, the
animal remains during life in the &s;ame condition
it was before that operation. As it feels no
longer the ardour of rutting, the concomitant
&s;ymptoms likewi&s;e di&s;appear. There is no long|er
any accumulation of fat or &s;uet, no more
turgidity of the neck and throat, and the di&s;po|&s;ition
of the creature becomes more gentle and
tranquil. The parts cut off, therefore, were ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
not only for collecting the redundant
nouri&s;hment, but likewi&s;e for pu&s;hing it to the
&s;urface of the body in the form of fat, and
particularly to the top of the head, where it
gives ri&s;e to the horns, and for giving vigour
and &s;pirit to the animal. Ca&s;trated &s;tags, it is
true, become fat; but they produce no horns;
their neck and throat never &s;well; and their fat
is never &s;o highly exalted as that of entire &s;tags,
which, in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, have an odour &s;o
&s;trong, as to be perceived at a great di&s;tance;
and their fle&s;h is &s;o infected with it, that it is un|eatable,
offen&s;ive to the &s;mell, and putrifies in a
very &s;hort time; while that of the ca&s;trated &s;tag
may be pre&s;erved fre&s;h, and eat at all &s;ea&s;ons.
The difference between the horns of &s;tags of the
<PB N="91" REF="124">
&s;ame age, of which &s;ome are thick, and others
thin and &s;lender, which is &s;olely owing to a de|fect
of food, is another proof that the horns are
produced by redundant nouri&s;hment: For a &s;tag
which inhabits a rich country, where he is not
di&s;turbed by dogs or men, but is allowed to feed
and ruminate in peace, will always have the high|e&s;t,
wide&s;t, large&s;t, and mo&s;t branchy horns.
But tho&s;e which live in &s;ituations where they
can neither find repo&s;e nor a &s;ufficient quantity
of food, will have horns with few branches,
&s;lender &s;tems, and brow-antlers. Thus it is
ea&s;y to judge, by the horns of the &s;tag, whether
he has lived in a rich and peaceful country, or
the oppo&s;ite. Tho&s;e which are in bad condi|tion,
have been wounded, or much di&s;turbed by
hunting, are &s;eldom fat, or have fine horns;
their rutting time is al&s;o later; and their horns
are neither &s;o &s;oon &s;hed or renewed. Hence
every circum&s;tance concurs in demon&s;trating
that the horns, like the &s;eminal fluid, are no|thing
but the redundant and &s;uperfluous organic
nouri&s;hment, which could not be exhau&s;ted in
expanding and &s;upporting the animal body.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, apparent, that penury of food
both retards the growth and dimini&s;hes the &s;ize
of the horns; and, perhaps, it is not impo&s;&s;ible,
by retrenching the quantity of food, to &s;uppre&s;s
entirely this production, without having recour&s;e
to ca&s;tration. It is, however, certain, that ca&s;tra|ted
&s;tags eat le&s;s food than tho&s;e which are un|mutilated;
and the females of this &s;pecies, as
<PB N="92" REF="125">
well as tho&s;e of the fallow-deer, the roe, and the
elk, have no horns, becau&s;e they eat le&s;s than
the males; and becau&s;e, at the very time that a
redundance of nouri&s;hment would naturally hap|pen,
they are with young, and, in&s;tead of &s;how|ing
it&s;elf externally, it is fir&s;t exhau&s;ted in nou|ri&s;hing
the foetus, and afterwards in nouri&s;hing
the fawn. The objection, that the female rain-deer,
which has horns like the male, rather &s;up|ports
than weakens this argument; for, of all
horned animals, the rain-deer, in proportion to
his &s;ize, has the large&s;t and mo&s;t voluminous
horns, often extending, before and behind, the
whole length of the body. He likewi&s;e abounds
mo&s;t in fat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Veneric de du Foilloux, p. 97.</NOTE>; and, be&s;ides, the horns of the female
are much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the male. This
example, therefore, proves no more than that,
when the redundance is &s;o great as not to be ex|hau&s;ted
by ge&s;tation and the growth of the foe|tus,
it breaks through the body, and forms a new
production, as in the male, only &s;maller in &s;ize,
becau&s;e the quantity of redundant matter is le&s;s.</P>
<P>What I have remarked concerning nouri&s;h|ment
ought not to be extended to the ma&s;s or
volume of the aliments, but only to the quanti|ty
of organic particles, that living, active, and
prolific matter which unfolds and &s;upports all a|nimated
beings. The re&s;t is nothing but dregs,
which may be more or le&s;s in quantity, without
inducing any change upon the body: And, as the
<PB N="93" REF="126">
lichen rangiferinus, or rain-deer liverwort, is the
ordinary food of the rain-deer, and is more &s;ub&s;tan|tial
than the leaves, the bark, or the buds of trees,
it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that this animal &s;hould have
a greater redundance of organic particles, and,
con&s;equently, larger horns, and more fat, than
the common &s;tag. It mu&s;t be acknowledged,
however, that the organic matter which produ|ces
the horns is not perfectly di&s;engaged from
u&s;ele&s;s particles, and that it pre&s;erves, after pa&s;|&s;ing
the body of the animal, marks of its former
vegetable &s;tate. The horns of the &s;tag &s;hoot,
grow, and are di&s;po&s;ed like the branches of a
tree. Its &s;ub&s;tance is, perhaps, le&s;s o&s;&s;eous than
lignous. To u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, it is a vegetable
grafted upon an animal, participating of the na|ture
of both, and forming one of tho&s;e &s;hades by
which nature always bounds the extremities of
her productions, and which &s;he employs to con|nect
&s;ub&s;tances that are greatly removed from
each other.</P>
<P>In the animal, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. art. <HI>Of Old age and Death.</HI></NOTE>, both
extremities of the bones grow at a time. The ful|crum
upon which the extending power is exerted,
is in the middle of the bone, which part is always
fir&s;t o&s;&s;ified, and from which the two extremes
progre&s;&s;ively recede, and continue &s;oft till the
bone acquires its full length. In the vegetable,
on the contrary, only one extremity of the wood
grows. The bud, which unfolds to form a
<PB N="94" REF="127">
branch, is attached to the old wood by its infe|rior
extremity, and upon this fulcrum the power
of longitudinal exten&s;ion acts. This remark|able
difference between the vegetation of bones
and the &s;olid parts of plants, does not take place
in the horns of &s;tags. On the contrary, nothing
can be more &s;imilar to the growth of a tree.
The horns extend at one extremity only, the o|ther
&s;erving for a fulcrum. They are fir&s;t tender
as an herb, and then harden like wood. The
&s;kin which covers and grows along with them is
their bark, and it is rubbed off after they attain
their full &s;ize. As long as they continue to grow,
their extremities are &s;oft; and they likewi&s;e di|vide
into &s;everal branches. In a word, every
circum&s;tance is &s;imilar, and corre&s;ponds in the
developement of both. Hence the organic par|ticles,
which con&s;titute the living &s;ub&s;tance of the
&s;tag, &s;till retain the impre&s;&s;ion of the vegetable;
becau&s;e they arrange them&s;elves in the &s;ame or|der
as the parts of plants. Here it is apparent,
that matter has an influence upon form. The
&s;tag which inhabits the fore&s;t, and feeds only on
the &s;prigs of trees, takes &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion
from the wood, that he produces a &s;pecies of
tree, which pre&s;erves indelible and evident marks
of its origin. This effect, though &s;ingular, is not
&s;olitary, and depends on a general cau&s;e, which I
have already pointed out.</P>
<P>Both in animals and vegetables, the character,
or mould, of each &s;pecies, is the mo&s;t con&s;tant
<PB N="95" REF="128">
and unalterable thing in Nature: What is mo&s;t
variable and de&s;ultory, is the matter of which they
are compo&s;ed. Matter, in general, &s;eems to be
indifferent to all forms, and capable of receiving
every po&s;&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion. The organic or li|ving
particles of this matter pa&s;s from vegetables
to animals, without de&s;truction or alteration, and
form equally the living &s;ub&s;tance of the herb, of
the wood, of the fle&s;h, and of the bones. Ac|cording
to this view, it appears that matter can
never have any influence on form, and that
no kind of food, provided the animal can ex|tract
the organic particles, and a&s;&s;imilate them by
nutrition, could induce any change upon the form,
or have any other effect than to &s;upport and ex|pand
the body, by modelling it&s;elf upon all the
particles of the interior mould, and intimately
penetrating them. What proves this point is,
that animals which live upon herbage, a &s;ub|&s;tance
very different from that of their own
bodies, extract from it materials &s;ufficient for
the production of fle&s;h and blood, and that they
are nouri&s;hed and grow as well as animals who
feed upon fle&s;h alone. However, by examining
Nature more minutely, we &s;hall find, that the&s;e
organic particles &s;ometimes do not perfectly a&s;&s;i|milate
them&s;elves to the internal mould, and that
matter has often a &s;en&s;ible influence upon form.
Size, for example, which is one of the attributes
of form, varies in every &s;pecies, according to the
difference of climate. The quality and quantity
<PB N="96" REF="129">
of fle&s;h, two other attributes of form, change ac|cording
to the difference of food. This organic
matter, therefore, which the animal a&s;&s;imilates
to its own body by nutrition, is not ab&s;olutely
indifferent to the reception of every form, nor
deprived of the original figure which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
It retains &s;ome characters of its primitive &s;tate.
It acts, therefore, by its proper form upon that
of the organized body to which it affords nou|ri&s;hment;
and, though this action is almo&s;t im|perceptible,
and infinitely inferior to the power
which obliges the organic particles to a&s;&s;imilate
them&s;elves to the internal mould that receives
them, yet, in the progre&s;s of time, &s;en&s;ible ef|fects
mu&s;t re&s;ult from it. The &s;tag, who inha|bits
the fore&s;ts, and lives &s;olely upon wood, pro|duces
and carries about with him a &s;pecies of
trees, which is nothing but the redundant part
of his nouri&s;hment. The beaver, who lives in
the waters, and feeds upon fi&s;hes, has a tail co|vered
with &s;cales. The fle&s;h of the otter, and of
mo&s;t water fowls, is a lent diet, a kind of fi&s;hy
fle&s;h. We may, therefore, pre&s;ume, that animals
perpetually nouri&s;hed by the &s;ame food, howe|ver
&s;trong the original impre&s;&s;ion of nature,
would, in proce&s;s of time, acquire a tincture from
the qualities of this food, and undergo a kind of
transformation, by an a&s;&s;imilation contrary to
the fir&s;t. The nouri&s;hment would no longer a&s;|&s;imilate
it&s;elf entirely to the form of the animal,
but the animal would partly a&s;&s;imilate it&s;elf to
<PB N="97" REF="130">
the form of the nouri&s;hment, as we perceive in
the horns of the &s;tag and the tail of the beaver.</P>
<P>In the &s;tag, the horns are an acce&s;&s;ory, a part
foreign to the animal, and only regarded as be|longing
to him, becau&s;e it proceeds from his
body. But it is really a vegetable production,
&s;ince it retains the characters of that vegetable
from which it derives its origin, and re&s;embles
the wood of trees, in the manner of its growth,
ramification, &s;olidity, drying, and &s;eparation;
for, after acquiring its greate&s;t den&s;ity, it
cea&s;es to extract nouri&s;hment, it falls &s;pontane|ou&s;ly,
like a ripe fruit from the branch. The
very name given to this production in our lan|guage,
is an indication that it has been regarded
as wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French call the horns of a &s;tag his <HI>wood.</HI></NOTE>, and not as a horn, a bone, a tu&s;k,
&amp;c. And, though this theory &s;eems to be &s;uffi|ciently

yet I ought not to pa&s;s over a fact recorded by

round the young horns of &s;tags. If this fact be
<PB N="98" REF="131">
true, and it may ea&s;ily be determined by experi|ment,
an analogy &s;till more intimate will be e|&s;tabli&s;hed
between the <HI>wood</HI> of the &s;tag and that
of trees.</P>
<P>The horns and tu&s;ks of other animals are not
only different from the <HI>wood</HI> of the &s;tag; but, in
their growth, texture, and form, both external
and internal, there is nothing analogous to wood.
The nails, the claws, the hairs, the feathers, the
&s;cales of animals, grow, it is admitted, by a &s;pe|cies
of vegetation; but this vegetation differs
widely from that of wood. The horns of oxen,
goats, antelopes, &amp;c. are hollow within; but
the wood of the &s;tag is equally &s;olid through
its whole extent. The &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e horns
is the &s;ame with that of the nails, claws, and
&s;cales: But the horns of the &s;tag re&s;emble wood
more than any other &s;ub&s;tance. The in&s;ide of
all hollow horns is covered with a kind of <HI>peri|o&s;teum,</HI>
and they contain in their cavity a bone,
or core, which &s;upports them; they never &s;hed,
but grow during the life of the animal; and its
age may be learned by their rings or annual
circles. In&s;tead of growing by their &s;uperior ex|tremity,
like the <HI>wood</HI> of the &s;tag, they grow
like nails, feathers, and hairs, by their inferior
extremity. In the &s;ame manner, the tu&s;ks of
the elephant, walrus, and wild boar, and all o|ther
animals, are hollow within, and grow only
by their inferior extremity. Thus horns and
<PB N="99" REF="132">
tu&s;ks have no more analogy to the <HI>wood</HI> of the
&s;tag than nails, hairs, or feathers.</P>
<P>Vegetation may, therefore, be reduced to three
kinds. The fir&s;t, in which the growth proceeds
from the &s;uperior extremity, as in plants, trees,
and the <HI>wood</HI> of the &s;tag; the &s;econd, where the
growth advances from the inferior extremity, as
in horns, nails, claws, hairs, feathers, &s;cales,
tu&s;ks, teeth, and other external parts of animal
bodies; the third, in which the growth proceeds
from both extremities at the &s;ame time, as in
bones, cartilages, mu&s;cles, tendons, and other in|ternal
parts of animals. The material cau&s;e of all
the&s;e three &s;pecies, is the redundance of organic
nouri&s;hment; and the a&s;&s;imilation of this nou|ri&s;hment
by the internal mould, which receives
it, is the effect. Thus the growth of an animal
is always more or le&s;s rapid, in proportion to the
quantity of this redundant nouri&s;hment; and,
after the greate&s;t part of growth is acquired, it
is determined to the &s;eminal re&s;ervoirs, endea|vours
to e&s;cape from the body, and to produce,
by means of copulation, new organized beings.
The difference between animals, which, like the
&s;tag, have fixed &s;ea&s;ons, and other animals which
can engender at all times, proceeds entirely from
their manner of feeding. Man and dome&s;tic a|nimals,
who have daily an equal quantity of
food, and often too much, are perpetually in a
capacity for procreation. The &s;tag, on the con|trary,
and mo&s;t wild animals, who &s;uffer greatly
<PB N="100" REF="133">
in the winter for want of food, have then no|thing
redundant, and are incapable of generating
till they recruit during the &s;ummer. It is im|mediately
after this &s;ea&s;on that the &s;tag begins
to rut; and, by the great wa&s;te he &s;uffers at this
period, he continues, during winter, in a &s;tate
of languor and debility. His fle&s;h is then &s;o
meagre, and his blood &s;o impoveri&s;hed, that
worms breed under his &s;kin, which &s;till augment
his mi&s;ery, and he does not get quit of them till
the &s;pring, when he acquires new life and vigour
by the active nouri&s;hment furni&s;hed to him by
the fre&s;h productions of the earth.</P>
<P>Thus the life of the &s;tag is &s;pent in alternate
plenty and want, vigour and debility, health and
&s;ickne&s;s, without having any change introduced
into his con&s;titution by the&s;e oppo&s;ite extremes.
He lives as long as other animals which are not
&s;ubjected to &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes. As he grows five
or &s;ix years, he lives &s;even times that number,
or from 35 to 40 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nouveau trait&eacute; de la venerie, p. 141.</NOTE>. What has been re|ported
concerning the longevity of the &s;tag me|rits
no credit. It is only a popular prejudice
which prevailed in the days of Ari&s;totle, and
which that philo&s;opher con&s;idered as improbable,
becau&s;e neither the time of ge&s;tation, nor of the
growth of the young &s;tag, indicated long life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vita e&s;&s;e perquam longa hoc animal fertur; &s;ed nihil certi ex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> quae narrantur videmus; nec ge&s;tatio aut incrementum hin|nulli ita evenit qua&s;i vita e&s;&s;et praelonga. <HI>Ari&s;t.

<PB N="101" REF="134">
This authority ought to have aboli&s;hed the pre|judice:
But it has been renewed, in the ages of ig|norance,
by a fabulous account of a &s;tag taken by
Charles VI. in the fore&s;t of Senlis, with a collar
upon which was written this in&s;cription, <HI>Cae&s;ar
hoc me donavit.</HI> The love of the marvellous
inclined men to believe that this animal had lived
a thou&s;and years, and had his collar from a Ro|man
Emperor, rather than to &s;uppo&s;e that he came
from Germany, where all the Emperors take the
name of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>The horns of the &s;tag augment annually both
in height and thickne&s;s, from the &s;econd to the
eighth year, and continue nearly in equal beauty
during all the vigour of life. But when he
grows old, his horns decline. Our &s;tags have
&s;eldom more than twenty or twenty-two ant|lers
or palms; and this number, even when at
the highe&s;t pitch of vigour and perfection, is by
no means con&s;tant; for it varies every year, ac|cording
to the quantity of nouri&s;hment and re|po&s;e
the animal has enjoyed: The largene&s;s of
the horns depends on the &s;ame cau&s;e; and their
quality is al&s;o determined by the kind of nou|ri&s;hment
they receive. Like the wood of the
fore&s;t, the <HI>wood</HI> of the &s;tag is large, tender, and
light in moi&s;t and fertile countries, and &s;hort,
hard, and heavy, in dry and barren regions.</P>
<P>The &s;ize and &s;tature of the animals them|&s;elves
likewi&s;e differ according to the places
they inhabit. The &s;tags which frequent the
<PB N="102" REF="135">
valleys, or hills abounding in grain, are larger
and taller than tho&s;e which feed upon dry and
rocky mountains. The latter are low, thick,
and &s;hort. Neither are they equally &s;wift; but
they run longer than the former: They are al&s;o
more vicious, and have longer hair on their
heads. Their horns are commonly &s;hort and
black, like a &s;tunted tree, the bark of which
is always of a darker colour. But the horns of
the &s;tags which feed in the plains are high, and
of a clear reddi&s;h colour, like the wood and bark
of trees which grow in a good &s;oil. The&s;e little
&s;quat &s;tags never frequent the lofty woods, but
keep always among the coppices, where they
can more ea&s;ily elude the pur&s;uit of the dogs.
The Cor&s;ican appears to be the &s;malle&s;t of
the&s;e mountain-&s;tags. He exceeds not the half
of the height of the ordinary kind, and may be
regarded as a terrier among &s;tags. His colour
is brown, his body is &s;quat, and his legs are
&s;hort. And, what convinces me, that the &s;ize
and &s;tature of &s;tags in general depend on the
quantity and quality of their food, is, that, ha|ving
reared one at my hou&s;e, and fed him very
plentifully for four years, he was much taller,
thicker, and plumper at that age than the olde&s;t
&s;tags in my woods, which are, however, of a
very good &s;ize.</P>
<P>Yellow is the mo&s;t common colour of the
&s;tag. But many of them are brown, and others
<PB N="103" REF="136">
red. White &s;tags are more rare, and &s;eem to be a
race that has become dome&s;tic, but very antient|ly;
for both Ari&s;totle and Pliny mention white
&s;tags; and they appear then to have been equal|ly
uncommon as at pre&s;ent. The colour of the
horns, like that of the hair, depends on the age
and nature of the animal, and the impre&s;&s;ion of
the air. The horns of young &s;tags are whiti&s;h,
and le&s;s deeply coloured than tho&s;e of the old.
Stags, who&s;e colour is a clear diluted yellow,
have often pale ill-coloured horns. Tho&s;e which
are of a lively yellow have generally red horns;
and brown &s;tags, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which have
black hair on the neck, have likewi&s;e black
horns. The internal &s;ub&s;tance of the horns, it
is true, is almo&s;t equally white in all &s;tags; but
they differ greatly in &s;olidity and texture. Some
of them are very &s;pongy, and even contain pret|ty
large cavities. This difference in texture is
&s;ufficient to account for their a&s;&s;uming different
colours; and it is unnece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e
to the juices of trees, &s;ince we daily &s;ee the
white&s;t ivory turn yellow or brown after being
expo&s;ed to the air, though its texture be much
more compact than that of the &s;tag's horns.</P>
<P>The &s;tag appears to have a fine eye, an acute
&s;mell, and an excellent ear. When li&s;tening, he
rai&s;es his head, erects his ears, and hears from a
great di&s;tance. When he is going into a cop|pice,
or other half covered place, he &s;tops to
look round him on all &s;ides, and &s;cents the wind,
<PB N="104" REF="137">
to di&s;cover if any object is near that might di|&s;turb
him. He is a &s;imple, and yet a curious
and crafty animal. When hi&s;&s;ed or called to
from a di&s;tance, he &s;tops &s;hort, and looks &s;ted|fa&s;tly,
and with a kind of admiration, at carria|ges,
cattle, or men; and, if they have neither
arms nor dogs, he moves on unconcernedly, and
without flying. He appears to li&s;ten, with great
tranquillity and delight, to the &s;hepherd's pipe;
and the hunters &s;ometimes employ this artifice
to encourage and deceive him. In general, he
is le&s;s afraid of men than of dogs, and is never
&s;u&s;picious, or u&s;es any arts of concealment, but
in proportion to the di&s;turbances he has recei|ved.
He eats &s;low, and has a choice in his ali|ment;
and, after his &s;tomach is full, he lies
down, and ruminates at lei&s;ure. He &s;eems to
ruminate with le&s;s facility than the ox. It is
only by violent &s;hakes that the &s;tag can make
the food ri&s;e from his fir&s;t &s;tomach. This diffi|culty
proceeds from the length and direction of
the pa&s;&s;age through which the aliment has to
go. The neck of the ox is &s;hort and &s;traight;
but that of the &s;tag is long and arched; and
therefore greater efforts are nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e
the food. The&s;e efforts are made by a kind of
hiccup, the movement of which is apparent, and
continues during the time of rumination. His
voice is &s;tronger, and more quivering, in pro|portion
as he advances in years. The voice of
the hind is &s;horter and more feeble. She never
<PB N="105" REF="138">
bellows from love, but from fear. The &s;tag,
during the rutting &s;ea&s;on, bellows in a frightful
manner: He is then &s;o tran&s;ported, that no|thing
di&s;turbs or terrifies him. He is, therefore,
ea&s;ily &s;urpri&s;ed; as he is loaded with fat, he can|not
keep long before the dogs. But he is dan|gerous
when at bay, and attacks the dogs with
a &s;pecies of fury. He drinks none in winter,
nor in &s;pring, the dews and tender herbage be|ing
then &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h his thir&s;t. But,
during the parching heats of &s;ummer, to obtain
drink, he frequents the brooks, the mar&s;hes, and
the fountains; and, in the &s;ea&s;on of love, he is
&s;o over-heated, that he &s;earches every where for
water, not only to &s;atisfy his immoderate thir&s;t,
but to bathe and refre&s;h his body. He then
&s;wims ea&s;ier than at any other times on account
of his fatne&s;s. He has been ob&s;erved cro&s;&s;ing
very large rivers. It has even been alledged,
that, attracted by the odour of the hinds, the
&s;tags, in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, throw them&s;elves
into the &s;ea, and pa&s;s from one i&s;land to another
at the di&s;tance of &s;everal leagues. They leap
&s;till more nimbly than they &s;wim; for, when
pur&s;ued, they ea&s;ily clear a hedge or a pale fence
of &s;ix feet high. Their food varies in different
&s;ea&s;ons. In autumn, after rutting, they &s;earch
for the buds of green &s;hrubs, the flowers of
broom or heath, the leaves of brambles, &amp;c.
During the &s;nows of winter, they feed upon the
bark, mo&s;s, &amp;c. of trees; and, in mild weather,
<PB N="106" REF="139">
they brouze in the wheat-fields. In the begin|ning
of &s;pring, they go in que&s;t of the catkins
of the trembling poplar, willow, and hazel trees,
the flowers and buds of the cornel-tree, &amp;c.
In &s;ummer, when they have great choice, they
prefer rye to all other grain, and the black berry-bearing
alder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhamnus frangula Linn.</NOTE> to all other wood. The fle&s;h of the
fawn is very good; that of the hind and knobber
not ab&s;olutely bad; but that of the &s;tag has al|ways
a &s;trong and di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. The &s;kin
and the horns are the mo&s;t u&s;eful parts of this
animal. The &s;kin makes a pliable and very du|rable
leather. The horns are u&s;ed by cutlers,
&s;word-&s;lippers, &amp;c. and a volatile &s;pirit, much
employed in medicine, is extracted from them
by the chymi&s;ts.</P>

<P>It is well known, that, in many animals, as
cats, owls, &amp;c. the pupil of the eye contracts
prodigiou&s;ly in the light, and dilates in the dark.
But this great contraction and dilatation had ne|ver
been ob&s;erved in the eyes of the &s;tag. I re|ceived
from M. Beccaria, a learned phy&s;ician
and celebrated profe&s;&s;or at Pi&s;a, the following
letter, dated at Turin, October 28. 1767.</P>
<P>'I pre&s;ented a piece of bread,' &s;ays M. Bec|caria,
'to a &s;tag that was confined in an ob&s;cure
<PB N="107" REF="140">
apartment, to allure him to a window, that I
might admire at lei&s;ure the rectangular and
tran&s;ver&s;e form of his pupils, which, in a
&s;trong light, exceed not half a line in width,
by about five lines in length. In a fainter
light, their breadth enlarges to more than a
line and a half; but &s;till pre&s;erve their rectan|gular
figure: And in pa&s;&s;ing from light to
darkne&s;s, they dilate about four lines, but al|ways
tran&s;ver&s;ely, that is, horizontally, and
pre&s;erving their rectangular form. The&s;e facts
may be ea&s;ily a&s;certained, by laying the hand
upon the eye of a &s;tag; for, whenever the eye
is uncovered, the pupil will be &s;een dilated a|bove
four lines.'</P>
<P>From this fact M. Beccaria concludes with
probability, that the other &s;pecies of deer enjoy
the &s;ame power of contracting and dilating their
pupils. But, what is mo&s;t remarkable, the pu|pils
of cats, owls, and &s;everal other animals,
contract and dilate vertically, while that of the
&s;tag contracts and dilates horizontally.</P>
<P>To the hi&s;tory of the &s;tag, I mu&s;t add a fact
communicated to me by M. le Marquis d'Ame|zaga,
who, to much learning, has joined great
experience in the chace.</P>
<P>'Stags,' he remarks, '&s;hed their horns &s;oon|er
or later in the month of March, in propor|tion
to their ages. At the end of June, the
horns of the old &s;tag are long, and begin to
itch him. It is at this time al&s;o, that the &s;tags
<PB N="108" REF="141">
begin to rub off the &s;kin which covers their
horns. At the commencement of Augu&s;t,
their horns begin to a&s;&s;ume that con&s;i&s;tence
which they retain during the re&s;t of the year:
On the 17th of October, the attendants of the
Prince of Cond&eacute; pur&s;ued a &s;tag of &s;ix years
old. This was the rutting &s;ea&s;on, when the
&s;tags are much le&s;s vigorous; but we were
&s;urpri&s;ed to find the animal fly at a great rate,
and lead near fix leagues from his harbour.'</P>
<P>'When this &s;tag was &s;eized, we found that
his horns were white, and &s;prinkled with blood,
as they ought to be at the time they are rub|bed
again&s;t the trees; and that they had &s;till
rags of the &s;kin which covers them during the
time of their growth. His horns were diver|&s;ified
with many branches. All the hunters
who were in at the death expre&s;&s;ed their &s;ur|pri&s;e
at the&s;e appearances. But their a&s;toni&s;h|ment
was augmented, when they wanted to
remove his te&s;ticles; for none were to be found
in the &s;crotum. But, after opening the body,
two te&s;ticles were di&s;covered in the abdomen
about the &s;ize of filberds, and we clearly per|ceived
that he had never experienced the ef|fects
of the rut. It is well known, that, during
the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, the
&s;tags are prodigiou&s;tly loaded with fat, which
is generally &s;o entirely exhau&s;ted about the
middle of September, that nothing but the mu&s;|cular
fle&s;h remains. But this &s;tag had lo&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="142">
none of his fat, becau&s;e he was never in a
condition for rutting. He had &s;till another
&s;ingularity; for, in the right foot, he wanted
the middle bone, which, in the left, was half
an inch long, and as large and pointed as a
tooth-pick.'</P>
<P>'It is well known, that a &s;tag, ca&s;trated when
he has no horns, never afterwards acquires
them, and that, if the operation is performed
when his horns are in perfection, they remain
in the &s;ame &s;tate during life. Hence it ap|pears,
that the very minute organs of genera|tion
above de&s;cribed were &s;ufficient to pro|duce
the annual change of horns; but that
Nature has always proceeded &s;lowly in the con|formation
of this animal; for we could di&s;co|ver
no marks of any accident which could in|duce
us to believe that the order of Nature had
been deranged. It is, therefore, rea&s;onable to
&s;uppo&s;e, that this retardation proceeded from
the imbecillity of the organs of generation,
which, however, were &s;ufficient to produce the
fall and renewal of the horns, &s;ince the cab|bage
or burs demon&s;trated, that, at the time
this &s;tag was killed, he had had horns annual|ly
from the &s;econd to the &s;ixth year.'</P>

&s;eem to prove, in a &s;till &s;tronger manner than
any thing formerly remarked, that the fall and
renovation of the &s;tag's horns depend entirely
on the pre&s;ence of the te&s;ticles, and partly on
<PB N="110" REF="143">
their being more or le&s;s perfect; for, in the in|&s;tance
before us, the te&s;ticles being imperfect
and too &s;mall, the horns, for that rea&s;on, in their
growth, &s;hedding, and renewal, were much later
than in other &s;tags.</P>

&s;tags, remarks, 'that they are only found
in the dioce&s;es of Bergen and Drontheim;
that they &s;ometimes &s;wim in flocks acro&s;s the
&s;traits between the continent and the neigh|bouring

<P>It has been thought, that the &s;tags of our
fore&s;ts might, by treating them with care and
gentlene&s;s, as the Laplanders manage the rain|deer,
be rendered dome&s;tic. Upon this &s;ubject,
M. le Vicomte de Querho&euml;nt has communicated
to me the following fact. Stags were fir&s;t
brought to the I&s;le of France by the Portugue&s;e.
They are &s;mall, and of a greyer colour than
tho&s;e of Europe, from whom, however, they de|rived
their origin. When the French took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this i&s;land, they found great numbers
of tho&s;e &s;tags, of which they de&s;troyed a part,
and the remainder took refuge in the mo&s;t re|tired
places. They are now rendered dome&s;tic,
<PB N="111" REF="144">
and &s;ome of the inhabitants keep large flocks of
them.</P>
<P>I have &s;een, at l'Ecole Veterinaire, a &s;mall kind
of &s;tag, which was &s;aid to have been brought
from the Cape of Good Hope. Its &s;kin was in|ter&s;per&s;ed
with white &s;pots, like that of the axis.
It was called the <HI>Hog-&s;tag,</HI> becau&s;e its legs were
thicker, and it had not the &s;ame agility of body
as the common kind. The figure of it is repre|&s;ented
in the Plate. Its length from the muzzle
to the extremity of the body, was only three
feet four inches and a half; the legs were &s;hort,
and the feet and hoofs very &s;mall; the colour
yellow, mixed with white &s;pots; the eye black
and open, with large black hair on the upper
eye-lid; the no&s;trils black, with a blacki&s;h band
at the corners of the mouth; the colour of the
head the &s;ame with that of the belly, only mixed
with grey, and brown on the chanfrin and &s;ides
of the eyes; the ears very large, garni&s;hed on
the in&s;ide with white hairs, and with &s;mooth
hair, mixed with yellow, on the out&s;ide. The
horns of this &s;tag were eleven inches &s;even lines
in length, and ten lines thick. The top of the
back was browner than the re&s;t of the body. The
tail was yellow above and white below; and the
legs were of a browni&s;h black colour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Pennant, in his Synop&s;is of Quadrupeds, which was publi&s;hed in the year 1771, has de&s;cribed this animal as a di&s;|tinct &s;pecies of deer.

<P>NO &s;pecies of animals makes &s;o near an ap|proach
to another as the fallow deer to
that of the &s;tag. But though their &s;imilarity
be great in every re&s;pect, they fly from each o|ther,
never intermix, and, of cour&s;e, give ri&s;e to
no intermediate race. It is even rare to find fal|low
deer in a country much frequented by &s;tags,
unle&s;s they are indu&s;triou&s;ly tran&s;ported into it.
Their nature &s;eems to be le&s;s ru&s;tic and robu&s;t
than that of the &s;tag; and they are likewi&s;e le&s;s
common in the fore&s;ts. They are kept in parks,
<PB N="114" REF="151">
where they may be &s;aid to be half dome&s;tic.
More of them are reared in England than in any
other country of Europe; and the Engli&s;h are
extremely fond of their veni&s;on. The dogs al|&s;o
prefer the fle&s;h of this deer to that of all other
animals; and, after they have once eat of it,
they are extremely apt, in the chace of the &s;tag
or roe deer, to change their cour&s;e when they
perceive the &s;cent of the fallow deer. In &s;ome
provinces of France, and in the neighbourhood
of Paris, there are fallow deer, as al&s;o in Spain
and Germany. Tho&s;e of America were probably
tran&s;ported from Europe. It &s;eems to be an a|nimal
peculiar to the temperate climates; for
there are none in Ru&s;&s;ia, and they are &s;eldom
met with in Sweden or other northern coun|tries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linn. Faun. Suec.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;tags are more generally diffu&s;ed over
Europe; they are even found in Norway, and
all the northern regions, Lapland, perhaps,
excepted. They are al&s;o frequent in A&s;ia, e&s;pe|cially
in Tartary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cription de l'Inde, par Marc Paul, liv. 1. p. 38. Let|tres edifiantes, recueil 26. p. 371.</NOTE>, and the northern provinces
of China. They are likewi&s;e found in America;
for tho&s;e of Canada<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Canadian &s;tag is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that of France; <HI>de&s;cription de la Nouv. France, par Charlevoix, tom.</HI> 13. <HI>p.</HI> 129.</NOTE> differ from ours only in
the length of their horns, and the direction of
<PB N="115" REF="152">
their antlers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the figure of the Canadian &s;tag, in <HI>l'hi&s;t. des animaux, par M. Perrault.</HI></NOTE>, which is &s;ometimes not &s;traight,
as in the common &s;tag, but turned backward, &s;o
that the end of each points to the &s;tem of the
horns. But this form of the horns is not ab&s;o|lutely
peculiar to the &s;tag of Canada; for we
find &s;imilar horns engraven in <HI>la Venerie de du
Fouilloux</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">La Venerie de Jacques du Fouilloux, p. 22.</NOTE>; and tho&s;e of the Cor&s;ican &s;tag
have &s;traight antlers; which is a &s;ufficient
proof that the Canadian &s;tag is only a variety,
to which &s;tags of all countries are &s;ubject.
There are likewi&s;e horns which have a number
of antlers on their &s;ummits, in form of a crown.
The&s;e are rarely found in France; but, &s;ays Du
Fouilloux<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 20.</NOTE>, they come from Ru&s;&s;ia and Germa|ny.
This is only another variety, and not a
different &s;pecies from the common kind. Hence,
in Canada, as well as in France, mo&s;t &s;tags have
&s;traight antlers; but in the former, they are lar|ger
and thicker; becau&s;e they find, in the&s;e un|inhabited
regions, more nouri&s;hment and repo&s;e
than in populous countries. There are large
and &s;mall &s;tags in America, as well as in Europe.
But, however generally this &s;pecies is diffu&s;ed, it
&s;eems to be limited to cold and temperate cli|mates.
The &s;tags of Mexico and South A|merica,
tho&s;e of Cayenne, tho&s;e called <HI>Gange
&s;tags,</HI> mentioned in M. Perrault's memoirs, un|der
<PB N="116" REF="153">
the name of <HI>Sardinian hinds,</HI> tho&s;e denomi|nated
<HI>Cape &s;tags,</HI> and tho&s;e of Guiney, and other
warm countries, belong not to the common &s;pe|cies,
as will appear when the particular hi&s;tory
of each is given.</P>
<P>As the fallow deer is le&s;s &s;avage, more deli|cate,
and approaches nearer to the dome&s;tic &s;tate
than the &s;tag, he is al&s;o &s;ubject to a greater num|ber
of varieties. Be&s;ides the common and the
white fallow deer, there are &s;everal other varie|ties,
as tho&s;e of Spain, which are nearly as large
as the &s;tag; but their neck is not &s;o thick, and
their colour is darker, with a blacki&s;h tail, not
white below, and longer than that of the com|mon
kind; tho&s;e of Virginia, which are almo&s;t
as large as tho&s;e of Spain, and remarkable for
the great &s;ize of their genital organs: Others
have a compre&s;&s;ed forehead, ears and tail longer
than tho&s;e of the common fallow deer, and
marked with a white &s;pot upon the hoofs of the
hind feet; others are &s;potted with white, black,
and yellow; and others are entirely black. All
the&s;e have their horns flatter, broader, and bet|ter
garni&s;hed with antlers than tho&s;e of the &s;tag;
they likewi&s;e incline more inwardly, and are
more palmated at the points; and, when the
horns are very &s;trong, the large&s;t antlers are
&s;ometimes terminated by &s;mall plams. The tail
of the common fallow deer is longer than that
of the &s;tag, and its hair is brighter. The horns
of the fallow deer &s;hed, like tho&s;e of the &s;tag;
<PB N="117" REF="154">
but they fall off later, and are renewed nearly
at the &s;ame time. Their rutting &s;ea&s;on arrives
fifteen days or three weeks after that of the &s;tag.
The males then bellow frequently, but with a
low and interrupted voice. They are not &s;o
furious as the &s;tag, nor exhau&s;t them&s;elves by
rutting. They never depart from their own
country in que&s;t of females; but they di&s;pute
and fight for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.
They a&s;&s;ociate in herds, which almo&s;t always
keep together. When there is a great number
in one park, they generally form them&s;elves in|to
two di&s;tinct troops, which &s;oon become ho|&s;tile,
becau&s;e they both wi&s;h to occupy the &s;ame
part of the inclo&s;ure. Each of the&s;e troops has
its own chief, who marches foremo&s;t; and he is
always the olde&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of the flock.
The others follow him; and the whole draw up
in order of battle, to force the other troop from
the be&s;t pa&s;ture. The order with which the&s;e
combats are conducted is very &s;ingular. They
make regular attacks, fight with courage, mutu|ally
&s;upport each other, and never think them|&s;elves
vanqui&s;hed by a &s;ingle check; for the battle
is daily renewed, till the weaker are completely
defeated, and obliged to remain in the wor&s;t pa|&s;ture.
They love elvated and hilly countries.
When chaced, they run not out, like the &s;tag,
but double, and endeavour to conceal them&s;elves
from the dogs by artifice, and by &s;ub&s;tituting an|other
animal in their place. However, when
<PB N="118" REF="155">
fatigued and heated, they take the water, but
never attempt to cro&s;s &s;uch exten&s;ive rivers as
the &s;tag. Thus, between the chace of the fal|low
deer and &s;tag, there is no material difference.
Their knowledge and in&s;tincts, their &s;hifts and
doublings, are the &s;ame, only they are more fre|quently
practi&s;ed: by the fallow deer. As he is
le&s;s enterpri&s;ing, and runs not &s;o far before the
dogs, he has oftener occa&s;ion to change, or &s;ub|&s;titute
another in his place, to double, return up|on
his former tracts, &amp;c. which renders the hunt|ing
of the fallow deer more &s;ubject to inconve|niencies
than that of the &s;tag. Be&s;ides, as he is
&s;maller and lighter, the impre&s;&s;ions of his feet
upon the ground are &s;lighter, and the branches
he knocks off from the trees with his horns are
&s;maller. Hence the dogs are le&s;s apt to ob&s;erve
the change, or &s;ub&s;titution of another animal,
and it is more difficult to bring them into the
&s;cent when at fault.</P>
<P>The fallow deer is very ea&s;ily tamed, and eats
many &s;ub&s;tances which are rejected by the &s;tag.
He likewi&s;e pre&s;erves his fat or veni&s;on much
better; for he is not rendered meagre by rutting,
though followed by the longe&s;t and &s;evere&s;t
winters; and he is nearly in the &s;ame condition
during the whole year. He brouzes clo&s;er than
the &s;tag, which makes the trees or bu&s;hes cut by
him more difficult to &s;hoot than tho&s;e cut by the
&s;tag. The young fallow deer eat quicker, and
with more avidity than the old. They rumi|nate;

they &s;earch for the females in their &s;econd
year, and attach not them&s;elves to one, like the
roe buck, but love variety, like the &s;tag. The
female goes with young eight months and &s;ome
days. Like the hind, &s;he produces one, &s;ome|times
two, and very rarely three fawns. They
are capable of engendering and producing from
the age of two to that of fifteen or &s;ixteen years.
La&s;tly, the fallow deer re&s;emble the &s;tag in al|mo&s;t
all their natural di&s;po&s;itions and habits;
the greate&s;t difference between the&s;e two animals
con&s;i&s;ts in the duration of their lives. We for|merly
remarked, from the te&s;timony of hunt&s;|men,
that the &s;tag lives thirty-five or forty years;
and, from the &s;ame authority, we learn that the
fallow deer live only about twenty years. As
they are &s;maller, it is probable that their growth
is &s;ooner accompli&s;hed than that of the &s;tag; be|cau&s;e,
in all animals, the duration of life is pro|portioned
to the time of growing, and not to the
time of ge&s;tation; for here the time of ge&s;tation
is the &s;ame. Be&s;ides, in other &s;pecies, as that of
the ox, though the time of ge&s;tation be long,
the duration of life is &s;hort. Of cour&s;e, we
ought not to mea&s;ure the duration of life by the
time of ge&s;tation, but by that of the growth,

<P>AS the &s;tag is the noble&s;t inhabitant of the

the fore&s;t, and the mo&s;t elevated ridges of tho&s;e
mountains which are covered with lofty trees.
The roe deer, as if inferior in &s;pecies, contents
<PB N="121" REF="160">
him&s;elf with a humbler re&s;idence, and generally
dwells among the thick foliage of young bru&s;h|wood.
But, if he is inferior to the &s;tag in dig|nity,
&s;trength, and &s;tature, he is endowed with
more gracefulne&s;s, vivacity, and courage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the fawns of the roe deer are attacked, he defends them with courage, and, though &s;maller, he has &s;trength enough to combat a young &s;tag, and put him to flight; <HI>Nouv. Trail&eacute; de la Venerie,</HI> p. 178.</NOTE>. He
is &s;uperior in gaiety, neatne&s;s, and &s;prightline&s;s.
His figure is more elegant and hand&s;ome. His
eyes are more brilliant and animated. His
limbs are more nimble, his movements quicker,
and he bounds, &s;eemingly without effort, with
equal vigour and agility. His coat, or hair, is
always clean, &s;mooth, and glo&s;&s;y. He never
wallows in the mire, like the &s;tag. He delights
in dry and elevated &s;ituations, where the air is
pure&s;t. He is likewi&s;e more crafty, conceals
him&s;elf with greater addre&s;s, is more difficult to
trace, and derives &s;uperior re&s;ources from in&s;tinct:
For, though he has the misfortune to leave be|hind
him a &s;tronger &s;cent than the &s;tag, which
redoubles the ardour and appetite of the dogs,
he knows how to withdraw him&s;elf from their
pur&s;uit, by the rapidity with which he begins
his flight, and by his numerous doublings. He
delays not his arts of defence till his &s;trength
fails him; but, as &s;oon as he finds that the fir&s;t
efforts of a rapid chace have been un&s;ucce&s;sful,
he repeatedly returns on his former &s;teps; and,

<PB N="122" REF="161">
the direction he has taken, after intermixing
the pre&s;ent with the pa&s;t emanations from
his body, he ri&s;es from the earth by a great
bound, and, retiring to a &s;ide, he lies down flat
on his belly, and, in this immoveable &s;ituation,
he allows the whole troop of his deceived ene|mies
to pa&s;s very near him.</P>
<P>The roe deer differs from the &s;tag and fallow
deer in di&s;po&s;ition, temperament, manners, and
almo&s;t every natural habit. In&s;tead of a&s;&s;ocia|ting
in heards, they live in &s;eparate families. The
father, mother, and young, go together, and
never mix with &s;trangers. They are con&s;tant in
their amours, and never unfaithful like the &s;tag.
As the females generally produce two fawns,
the one male and the other female, the&s;e young
animals, brought up and nouri&s;hed together, ac|quire
&s;o &s;trong a mutual affection, that they ne|ver
quit each other, unle&s;s one of them meets
with a misfortune, which never ought to &s;epa|rate
lovers. This attachment is more than love;
for, though always together, they feel the ar|dour
of the rut but once a year, and it continues
only fifteen days, commencing at the end of
October, and ending before the fifteenth day of
November. They are not then, like the &s;tag,
overloaded with fat: They have no &s;trong &s;mell,
no fury, in a word, nothing that can change the
&s;tate of their bodies. During this period, they
indeed &s;uffer not their fawns to remain with
them. The father drives them off, as if he meant
<PB N="123" REF="162">
to oblige them to yield their place to tho&s;e
which are to &s;ucceed, and to form new families
for them&s;elves. However, after the rutting &s;ea|&s;on
is pa&s;t, the fawns return to their mother,
and remain with her &s;ome time; after which
they &s;eparate forever, and remove to a di&s;tance
from the place which gave them birth.</P>
<P>The female goes with young five months and
a half, and brings forth about the end of April
or beginning of May. The hinds, as formerly
remarked, go with young above eight months;
and this difference alone is &s;ufficient to prove,
that the&s;e animals are &s;o remote from each other
in &s;pecies, as to prevent their ever intermixing
or producing an intermediate race. By this dif|ference,
as well as that of figure and &s;ize, they
approach the goat as much as they recede from
the &s;tag; for the goat goes with young nearly
the &s;ame time, and the roe deer may be regard|ed
as a wild goat, which, feeding &s;olely on wood,
carries <HI>wood</HI> in&s;tead of horns. The female, when
about to bring forth, &s;eparates from the male.
To avoid the wolf, who is her mo&s;t dangerous
enemy, &s;he conceals her&s;elf in the deepe&s;t rece&s;|&s;es
of the fore&s;t. In ten or twelve days, the
fawns acquire &s;trength &s;ufficient to enable them
to follow her. When threatened with danger,
&s;he hides them in a clo&s;e thicket, and, to pre&s;erve
them, pre&s;ents her&s;elf to be chaced. But, not|with&s;tanding
all her care and anxiety, the young
are &s;ometimes carried off by men, dogs, or
<PB N="124" REF="163">
wolves. This is indeed the time of their great|e&s;t
de&s;truction. Of this &s;pecies, which is not
very numerous, I know, from experience, that
more are de&s;troyed in the month of May, than
during all the re&s;t of the year. I often live in a
part of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Montbard in Burgundy.</NOTE> where roe deer are greatly
e&s;teemed. Many fawns are annually brought
me alive by men, and others killed by dogs,
without reckoning tho&s;e which are devoured by
wolves: And I have ob&s;erved, during the &s;pace
of more than twenty-five years, that, as if there
were a perfect equilibrium between the cau&s;es
of de&s;truction and renovation, their number is
always nearly equal in the &s;ame di&s;tricts. It is
not difficult to count them; for they are no
where numerous, and they live &s;eparately in di|&s;tinct
families: In a coppice, for example, of
100 acres, there will be one family, or from three
to five individuals; for a female, which gene|rally
produces two fawns, &s;ometimes brings forth
but one, and &s;ometimes, though very &s;eldom,
three. In another di&s;trict, of double the extent,
there will be &s;even or eight, that is, two fami|lies;
and I have remarked, that each di&s;trict al|ways
harbours an equal number, excepting when
the winters have been extremely rigorous and
long: In this ca&s;e, the whole family is de&s;troy|ed;
but it is replaced by another the following
year; and tho&s;e di&s;tricts, for which they have a
predilection, are always inhabited nearly by an
<PB N="125" REF="164">
equal number. It is alledged, however, that, in
general, their number is dimini&s;hing. There are
whole provinces, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, of
France, where not one of them is to be found.
Though common in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are not very common in Scotland; for they exi&s;t no where but in what is called the <HI>Highlands,</HI> or northern moun|tains of Scotland.</NOTE>, there are none
in England. They are very rare in Italy; and
they are now &s;carcer in Sweden than formerly,
&amp;c. But this effect may have proceeded from
the diminution of fore&s;ts, or from &s;ome very &s;e|vere
winter, like that of the year 1709, which
almo&s;t de&s;troyed the whole roe deer of Burgun|dy;
&s;o that &s;everal years pa&s;&s;ed before the &s;pecies
was recruited. Be&s;ides, they are not equally
fond of every country; for, in the &s;ame coun|tries,
they prefer particular places. They love
hills, or plains on the tops of mountains. They
never &s;tay in the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;ts,
nor in the middle of exten&s;ive woods; but give
the preference to the &s;kirts or projections of
woods which are &s;urrounded with cultivated
&s;ields, and to open coppices which produce the
berry-bearing alder, brambles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fawns continue with their parents eight
or nine months, and, when &s;eparated, about the
end of the fir&s;t years of their age, their fir&s;t horns
begin to appear in the form of two knobs much
le&s;s than tho&s;e of the &s;tag. There is &s;till a great|er
difference between the&s;e two animals: The
horns of the &s;tag &s;hed in the &s;pring, and are re|newed
<PB N="126" REF="165">
in &s;ummer; but tho&s;e of the roe deer fall
off at the end of autumn, and are replaced in
winter. Several cau&s;es concur in producing the&s;e
different effects. In &s;ummer, the &s;tag takes a
great deal of nouri&s;hment, and grows exceed|ingly
fat; he next exhau&s;ts him&s;elf &s;o much
in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, that the whole winter is
nece&s;&s;ary to recover his vigour. But, during
this &s;ea&s;on, in&s;tead of &s;uperabundant nouri&s;h|ment,
he is half &s;tarved for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
and, con&s;equently, his horns cannot begin to
&s;hoot till the &s;pring, when his nouri&s;hment be|gins
to be redundant. The roe deer, on the
contrary, who is never &s;o much wa&s;ted, has no
occa&s;ion for equal reparation; and, as he is ne|ver
loaded with fat, as no change is produced in
him by rutting, but continues always nearly the
&s;ame, he has at all times a redundance of nou|ri&s;hment;
&s;o that even in winter, and a &s;hort
time after rutting, he &s;heds and renews his horns.
Thus, in all the&s;e animals, the redundant orga|nic
nouri&s;hment, before it is determined to the
&s;eminal re&s;ervoirs, and forms the &s;eminal fluid,
is transferred to the head, and manife&s;ts it&s;elf
externally by the production of horns; in the
&s;ame manner as in man, the hair and the beard
announce and precede the &s;ecretion of the &s;emi|nal
fluid: And, it is apparent, that the&s;e vege|table
productions, as they may be denominated,
are formed of a redundant organic &s;ub&s;tance, but
&s;till imperfect, and mixed with brute particles,
<PB N="127" REF="166">
&s;ince they pre&s;erve, in their growth and &s;ub|&s;tance,
the qualities of vegetables. But the &s;e|minal
fluid, the production of which is not &s;o
early, is a matter purely organic, deprived en|tirely
of its brute particles, and perfectly a&s;&s;imi|lated
to the body of the animal.</P>
<P>When the roe deer has renewed his horns, he
rubs them again&s;t the trees, like the &s;tag, in or|der
to tear off the &s;kin with which they are co|vered;
and this commonly happens in the month
of March, before the trees begin to &s;hoot. Hence
it is not the &s;ap of the wood which colours the
horns of the roe deer. However, the horns are
brown when the animal is brown, and yellow
when he is red; and, con&s;equently, the colour
of the horns proceeds, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, Hi&s;tory of the &s;tag, p. 103.</NOTE>,
&s;olely from the nature of the animal, and the
impre&s;&s;ion of the air. The &s;econd horns of the
roe have two or three antlers in each &s;ide; the
third, three or four; the fourth, four or five,
and they &s;eldom have more. We di&s;tingui&s;h
the old ones by the thickne&s;s of the &s;tems, the
largene&s;s of the bur, of the pearlings, &amp;c. As
long as the horns continue &s;oft, they are ex|tremely
&s;en&s;ible: Of this I have had a &s;triking
example: The young &s;hoot of a roe buck's
horn was cut off with a ball. The animal
was &s;tunned, and fell down as if he had been
dead. The &s;hooter, who was near, &s;eized him
by the foot; but the buck, &s;uddenly recovering
<PB N="128" REF="167">
his &s;en&s;es and his &s;trength, dragged the man,
though he was &s;trong and alert, thirty paces in|to
the wood. After killing him with a knife,
we di&s;covered that he had received no other
wound. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that flies are
very trouble&s;ome to the &s;tag: When his horns
are growing, he retires to the deepe&s;t parts of
the wood, where the flies are le&s;s numerous;
becau&s;e, when they fix upon the tender horns,
the irritation they occa&s;ion is in&s;upportable.
Thus there is an intimate communication be|tween
the &s;oft parts of the horns, and the whole
nervous &s;y&s;tem of the animal. The roe buck,
who has nothing to apprehend from the flies,
becau&s;e he renews his horns in winter, never re|tires
in this manner; but he walks with caution,
and carries his head low, le&s;t he &s;hould touch
the branches.</P>
<P>In the &s;tag, the fallow deer, and roe buck,
the frontal bone has two proce&s;&s;es, or eminences,
on which the horns re&s;t. The&s;e proce&s;&s;es be|gin
to &s;hoot at the age of five or &s;ix months,
&s;oon after acquire their full growth, and, in&s;tead
of ri&s;ing higher in proportion as the animal ad|vances
in years, they annually &s;ink and dimi|ni&s;h;
&s;o that, in old &s;tags or roe bucks, the
burs are nearly &s;upported upon the frontal bone,
the proce&s;&s;es of which having then become very
broad and very &s;hort: This is the mo&s;t certain
mark by which the age of the&s;e animals can be
di&s;tingui&s;hed. At fir&s;t &s;ight, this fact appears to
<PB N="129" REF="168">
be &s;ingular, but admits of an ea&s;y explanation,
when it is con&s;idered, that the horns, &s;upported
by the&s;e proce&s;&s;es, pre&s;s again&s;t them during the
whole time of growth, which continues for &s;e|veral
months every year: Hence the&s;e bones,
however hard, mu&s;t become broader and &s;ink
lower annually, by the great and long continued
pre&s;&s;ure they receive from every renewal of the
animal's horns. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that,
though the &s;tems and burs, or rings, always
grow thicker in proportion to the animal's age,
the height of the horns and the number of
antlers dimini&s;h &s;o fa&s;t, that, when he is very
old, they are only two thick knobs, with very
&s;mall antlers.</P>
<P>As the female roe goes with young only five
months and a half, and as the growth of the
fawn is more rapid than that of the &s;tag, the du|ration
of her life is much &s;horter, &s;eldom exten|ding,
I imagine, beyond twelve or fifteen years.
I have reared &s;everal of them; but could never
pre&s;erve them above five or &s;ix years. They
are very delicate in the choice of their food, re|quire
a great deal of exerci&s;e, fine air, and much
room, which is the rea&s;on why they are unable,
excepting in the fir&s;t years of their growth, to re|&s;i&s;t
the inconveniences of a dome&s;tic life. To make
a male live comfortable, he mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with
a female, and a park of a hundred acres. They
may be tamed, but can never be rendered obe|dient
or familiar. They always retain a por|tion
<PB N="130" REF="169">
of their natural wildne&s;s, are ea&s;ily terrifi|ed,
and then run with &s;uch force and precipita|tion
again&s;t the walls, that they often break
their limbs. However tame they may be, they
cannot be tru&s;ted; for the males particularly are
&s;ubject to dangerous caprices; they take an aver|&s;ion
at certain per&s;ons, and make furious attacks
with their horns, the blows of which are &s;uffi|cient
to knock a man to the ground, after which
they continue to tread on him with their feet.
The roe buck bellows not &s;o frequently, nor
with &s;o loud or &s;o &s;trong a voice, as the &s;tag.
The young ones utter a &s;hort and plaintive cry,
<HI>mi....mi,</HI> by which they indicate their want of
food. This &s;ound is ea&s;ily imitated; and the
mother, deceived by the <HI>call,</HI> will come up to
the very muzzle of the hunter's gun.</P>
<P>In winter, the roe bucks frequent the thicke&s;t
coppices, and feed upon brambles, broom, heath,
the catkins of the hazel, willow, &amp;c. In &s;pring,
they repair to the more open bru&s;hwood, and
eat the buds and young leaves of almo&s;t every
tree. This warm food ferments in their &s;to|machs,
and intoxicates them to &s;uch a degree
that they are ea&s;ily &s;urpri&s;ed. They know not
where they are going, and not unfrequently
come out of the wood, and &s;ometimes approach
flocks of cattle, and the habitations of men. In
&s;ummer, they dwell in the more elevated coppi|ces,
from which they &s;eldom depart, excepting
in very dry weather, when they go to drink at
<PB N="131" REF="170">
&s;ome fountain; for, when the dews abound,
or the leaves are moi&s;tened with rain, they ne|ver
drink. They are delicate in the choice of
their food; they eat not with avidity, like the
&s;tag, and they &s;eldom approach the cultivated
fields, becau&s;e they prefer the berry-bearing alder
and bramble to grain or pot herbs of any kind.</P>
<P>Though the fle&s;h of the&s;e animals be excel|lent
food; yet it admits of much choice. The
quality of their veni&s;on depends chiefly on
the country they inhabit; and even the be&s;t
countries produce good and bad kinds. The
fle&s;h of the brown roe buck is finer than that of
the red. All the males, after the age of two
years, have hard and ill-ta&s;ted fle&s;h; but that of
the females, though farther advanced in years,
is more tender. The fle&s;h of the fawns, when
very young, is loo&s;e and &s;oft; but, at the age of
eighteen months, it is in its highe&s;t &s;tate of per|fection.
Tho&s;e which live in plains and val|leys
are not good; tho&s;e that come from moi&s;t
countries are &s;till wor&s;e; tho&s;e brought up in
parks are in&s;ipid; and, la&s;tly, there are no good
roe bucks but tho&s;e of dry and elevated coun|tries,
inter&s;per&s;ed with hills, woods, cultivated
and fallow lands, where they enjoy plenty of air,
food, freedom, and &s;olitude; for tho&s;e which
have been often di&s;turbed are meagre, and the
fle&s;h of tho&s;e that have been often hunted is dry
and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies, which is le&s;s numerous than that
of the &s;tag, and very rare in many parts of Eu|rope,
<PB N="132" REF="171">
&s;eems to be much more abundant in Ame|rica,
where there are two varieties, the red,
which is the large&s;t, and the brown, which has
a white &s;pot behind, and is &s;maller: And, as
they are found in the northern as well as the
&s;outhern parts of America, it is probable that
they differ more from each other than from
tho&s;e of Europe. They are very common,
for example, in Loui&s;iana<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fle&s;h of the roe buck is much u&s;ed in Loui&s;iana. This animal is &s;omewhat larger than the European kind, and his horns are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the &s;tag; but he differs both in the coat and the colour. He &s;erves the inhabitants in place of mutton; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ur la Loui&s;iaine,</HI> par <HI>M. Dumont, tom.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 75.</NOTE>, and larger than
tho&s;e of France. They are likewi&s;e found
in Brazil; for the animal called <HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI>
differs not more from our roe buck than
the &s;tag of Canada from our &s;tag. There is in|deed
a little variation in the figure of the horns,
as appears from Perrault's figure of the Canadi|an
&s;tag, compared with the de&s;cription and fi|gure
of the Bra&s;ilian &s;tag given by Pi&s;o. 'In
Brazil,' &s;ays Pi&s;o, 'there are roe bucks, of
which &s;ome have no horns, and are called
<HI>Cujuacu-&eacute;t&eacute;,</HI> and others have horns, and are
called <HI>Cujuacu-apara.</HI> The latter are &s;maller
than the former; their hair is &s;mooth, glo&s;&s;y,
and mixed with brown and white, e&s;pecially
when the animals are young; for the white is
effaced with age. The foot is divided into two
black toes, upon each of which there is a &s;mal|ler
one &s;uperinduced; the tail is &s;hort; the
<PB N="133" REF="172">
eyes large and black; the no&s;trils open; the
horns are of a middle &s;ize, and fall off annual|ly.
The female goes with young five or &s;ix
months. They may be tamed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;on. Hi&s;t. Bra&s;il. p. 98.</NOTE>,' &amp;c. Mar|graave
adds, 'that the horns of the <HI>apara</HI> have
three branches, and that the inferior branch is
longe&s;t and divided into two.' From the&s;e de|&s;criptions,
it is apparent, that the <HI>apara</HI> is only a
variety of our roe buck; and Ray &s;u&s;pects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Raii Synop&s;. anim. quad. p. 90.</NOTE>,
that the <HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI> is the male, and the <HI>Cu|juacu-&eacute;t&eacute;</HI>
the female, and that they both belong
to the &s;ame &s;pecies. I &s;hould willingly a&s;&s;ent to
Mr Ray's opinion, if Pi&s;o had not expre&s;sly &s;aid,
that tho&s;e which have horns are &s;maller than
the other kind. It is not probable that, at Bra|zil,
the females of this &s;pecies &s;hould be larger
than the males, &s;ince every where el&s;e they are
&s;maller. At the &s;ame time, though I believe the
<HI>Cujuacu-apara</HI> to be only a variety of our roe
buck, to which we may al&s;o add the <HI>Capreolus

<P>It has frequently been mentioned, in my ori|ginal

animals are yellow, brown, and grey, and that
the dome&s;tic &s;tate gives ri&s;e to white fallow deer,
white rabbits, &amp;c. I find, however, that Nature
alone &s;ometimes produces the &s;ame effect upon
wild animals. M. l'Abb&eacute; de la Villette informs
me, that a man belonging to his brother's e&s;tate,

<P>Roe bucks, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Europe, are
found throughout all North America; only
they are larger, and their &s;ize increa&s;es in pro|portion
as the climate becomes more temperate.
The roe bucks of Loui&s;iana are generally double
the &s;ize of tho&s;e of France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from M. de Fontenelle, King's phy&s;i|cian at New Orleans, to M. de Buffon.</NOTE>. M. de Fontenelle
adds, that they are ea&s;ily tamed. In this he is
&s;upported by the evidence of M. Kalm, who
mentions a roe buck which went daily to the
<PB N="135" REF="174">
wood in que&s;t of food, and returned to his hou&s;e
in the evening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Pierre Kalm, tom. 2. p. 350.</NOTE>. But, in South America, this
&s;pecies is &s;ubject to great varieties. M. de la
Borde, King's phy&s;ician at Cayenne, &s;ays, 'that
they have there four kinds of &s;tags, called in|di&s;criminately,
both males and females, by the
name of <HI>hinds.</HI> The fir&s;t kind, called <HI>wood</HI> or
<HI>red hinds,</HI> keep perpetually in the thicke&s;t parts
of the woods, to avoid being tormented by the
flies. This kind is taller and thicker than that
called the <HI>&s;avanna hind,</HI> and yet is exceed|ed
in &s;ize by the <HI>barallou hind,</HI> which is the
&s;econd &s;pecies, and of the &s;ame colour with the
wood hind. When the males are old, their
horns con&s;i&s;t of only one branch, and they at
no period exceed four or five inches in height.
The&s;e barallou hinds are rare, and combat the
wood hinds. In the&s;e two &s;pecies, at the &s;ide
of each no&s;tril, there are two con&s;iderable
glands which &s;ecrete a white, fetid humour.'</P>
<P>'The third &s;pecies is called the <HI>&s;avanna hind.</HI>
Its coat is greyi&s;h, and its limbs and body long|er
than the preceding. M. de la Borde was
a&s;&s;ured by the hunters, that the &s;avanna hind
had no glands on the no&s;trils, and that it was
le&s;s &s;avage, and even &s;o curious as to approach
men.'</P>
<P>'The fourth &s;pecies is the &s;avanna hind,
which is &s;maller and more common than the
other three. They are not &s;o wild, and their
<PB N="136" REF="175">
horns are longer and more palmated or branch|ed
than tho&s;e of the other three kinds. They
are called <HI>&s;avanna hinds,</HI> becau&s;e they fre|quent
the watery &s;avannas, and lands covered
with mar&s;hes.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e animals feed upon the manioc, and
often de&s;troy the plantations. Their fle&s;h is
very tender and well-ta&s;ted. Both the old and
the young are u&s;ed as food, and are &s;uperior
to the European &s;tags. They tame &s;o ea&s;ily,
that they run about the &s;treets of Cayenne,
and go out of the town and return, without
being afraid of any object. The females even
go into the woods in que&s;t of wild males, and
afterwards return with their fawns.'</P>
<P>'The caricou is the &s;malle&s;t; his hair is of a
whiti&s;h grey colour; and his horns are &s;traight
and pointed. He belongs rather to the roe
buck than to the &s;tag. He never appears near
inhabited places; but is very common in large
woods. However, he is ea&s;ily tamed; and
the female brings forth only one fawn every
year.'</P>
<P>If the above de&s;criptions be compared with
what is afterwards remarked, in the hi&s;tory of
the <HI>Mazame,</HI> or Mexican deer, it will appear,
that all the&s;e pretended &s;pecies of &s;tags or hinds,
are only roe bucks, the varieties of which are
more numerous in the New than in the Old

<P>THE mo&s;t numerous &s;pecies of animals are
by no means the mo&s;t u&s;eful. Nothing
can be more noxious than tho&s;e multitudes of
rats, mice, locu&s;ts, caterpillars, and other in&s;ects,
the fecundity of which Nature &s;eems rather to
permit than to ordain. But the &s;pecies of the
<PB N="138" REF="179">
hare and of the rabbit afford to man the double
advantage ari&s;ing from number and utility. The
hare is univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed over all the climates
of the earth. The rabbits, though originally na|tives
of particular climates, multiply &s;o prodigi|ou&s;ly
wherever they are tran&s;ported, that, in&s;tead
of being rooted out, much art is nece&s;&s;ary to di|mini&s;h
their number, which is &s;ometimes incom|modious.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the amazing fecundity
of each &s;pecies, the rapid and prodigious multi|plication
of particular animals which come forth
in myriads to ravage the earth, we are a&s;toni&s;hed
that they oppre&s;s not Nature by their numbers,
and, after de&s;olating her productions, fall vic|tims
to the univer&s;al wa&s;te they have created.</P>
<P>We view with terror the approach of tho&s;e
thick clouds, tho&s;e winged armies of fami&s;hed in|&s;ects,
which &s;eem to threaten the whole globe
with de&s;truction, and, lighting on the fruitful
plains of Egypt, or of India, annihilate, in an
in&s;tant, the labours and the hopes of nations;
and, &s;paring neither grain, nor fruits, nor herbs,
nor leaves, nor roots, &s;poil the earth of its ver|dure,
and convert the riche&s;t countries into de|&s;erts.
We behold, de&s;cending from the moun|tains
of the north, innumerable multitudes of
rats, which, like an animated deluge, overwhelm
the plains, &s;pread over the &s;outhern provinces,
and, after de&s;troying, in their pa&s;&s;age, every thing
that lives or vegetates, fini&s;h their noxious cour&s;e,
<PB N="139" REF="180">
by infecting the earth and the air with the pu|trid
emanations of their dead carca&s;&s;es. In the
&s;outhern regions, we behold, i&s;&s;uing &s;uddenly
from the de&s;erts, myriads of ants, which, like an
inexhau&s;tible torrent, pre&s;s forward in continued
columns, drive men and animals from their ha|bitations,
and never retire till they have produ|ced
an univer&s;al deva&s;tation: And, when men,
like the animals, were half &s;avage, and &s;ubject
to all the laws and exce&s;&s;es of Nature, have not
&s;imilar inundations of the human &s;pecies taken
place? Have not Normans, Huns, Goths, whole
nations, or rather colonies of fierce and brutal
people, without habitation or name, &s;uddenly
i&s;&s;ued from their caverns, and with no other
power but what ari&s;es from number, overturned
cities and empires, and, after laying wa&s;te the
earth, repeopled it with men equally new and
barbarous as them&s;elves?</P>
<P>The&s;e great events, the&s;e remarkable aeras in
the hi&s;tory of the human race, are, however,
only &s;light vici&s;&s;itudes in the ordinary cour&s;e of
animated Nature, which, in general, is always
the &s;ame: Its movements are performed on two
&s;teady pivots, unlimited fecundity, and tho&s;e in|numerable
cau&s;es of de&s;truction which reduce the
product of this fecundity to a determined mea|&s;ure,
and pre&s;erve, at all periods, nearly an e|qual
number of individuals in each &s;pecies. And,
as tho&s;e enormous multitudes of animals, which
&s;ometimes &s;uddenly appear, vani&s;h without aug|menting
<PB N="140" REF="181">
menting the common &s;tock, that of the human
&s;pecies, in like manner, continues always the
&s;ame. The variations of the latter are only
&s;lower; becau&s;e, the life of man being longer
than that of &s;mall animals, more is nece&s;&s;ary to
bring about the alternate changes of augmenta|tion
and diminution. But even this time, though
it makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e it has been
accompanied with horror and de&s;olation, is only
an in&s;tant in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages: For, in e&s;ti|mating
the whole human &s;pecies who ever exi&s;t|ed,
the number of men, like that of all other a|nimals,
ought, at all periods, to be nearly the
&s;ame, &s;ince it depends upon the equilibrium of
phy&s;ical cau&s;es; and this equilibrium, to which
every thing has been long reduced, cannot be
infringed either by the efforts of men, or by any
moral circum&s;tances, which are only particular
effects of tho&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es. Whatever care
man may be&s;tow on his own &s;pecies, he will ne|ver
render it more numerous in one place, but
at the expence of an equal diminution in another.
When any portion of the earth is over&s;tocked
with men, they di&s;per&s;e, or de&s;troy each other,
and often e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch laws and cu&s;toms as give
too great a check to this exce&s;s of multiplication.
In remarkably prolific climates, as in China,
Egypt, and Guiney, the inhabitants bani&s;h, mu|tilate,
&s;ell, or drown their off&s;pring: In France,
and other Catholic countries, they are condemn|ed
to perpetual celebacy. Tho&s;e who exi&s;t, u&s;urp
<PB N="141" REF="182">
ea&s;ily the rights of tho&s;e who have no exi&s;t|ence:
Regarding them&s;elves as nece&s;&s;ary beings,
they annihilate tho&s;e which are contingent, and,
for their own convenience, &s;uppre&s;s future ge|nerations.
The &s;ame re&s;trictions are laid upon
man, without his perceiving it, as are impo&s;ed upon
the other animals: We cheri&s;h or multiply, ne|glect
or de&s;troy our &s;pecies, according to the advan|tages
or inconveniences which re&s;ult from them:
And, as all moral effects depend upon phy&s;ical
cau&s;es, which, ever &s;ince the earth acquired its
con&s;i&s;tence, are fixed and permanent, the num|ber
of the human &s;pecies, as well as that of all
other animals, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be con&s;tant and un|alterable.
Be&s;ides, this &s;ixed &s;tate, this con&s;tant
number, imply not ab&s;olute quantities. All phy|&s;ical
and moral cau&s;es, and the effects that re&s;ult
from them, are balanced, and comprehended
within certain limits, which are more or le&s;s ex|tended,
but never to &s;uch a degree as to de&s;troy
the equilibrium. As the whole univer&s;e is in
perpetual motion, as all the powers of matter
mutually act upon and counterbalance each other,
every effect is produced by a kind of o&s;cillations,
to the middle points of which we refer the or|dinary
cour&s;e of Nature, and the extremes are
tho&s;e effects which are farthe&s;t removed from
that cour&s;e. Hence we find, that, both in ani|mals
and vegetables, an exce&s;&s;ive multiplication
is commonly followed by &s;terility: Plenty and
&s;carcity alternately &s;ucceed each other, and of|ten
<PB N="142" REF="183">
&s;o quickly, that a tolerable judgment may
be formed of the produce of one year by that of
the preceding year. Apple, plumb, oak, beech,
and mo&s;t fruit and fore&s;t trees, produce abun|dantly
but once every other &s;ea&s;on. When ca|terpillars,
flies, field-mice, and other animals
mutliply to exce&s;s in one year, their number is
greatly dimini&s;hed the following year. If in&s;ects,
during the&s;e fertile &s;ea&s;ons, multiplied the next
in proportion to their numbers, the whole fruits
of the earth, all our dome&s;tic animals, and even
man him&s;elf, would fall victims to their rapacity.
But the cau&s;es of de&s;truction and &s;terility imme|diately
&s;ucceed tho&s;e which give ri&s;e to a redun|dant
multiplication. Neither is this de&s;truction
occa&s;ioned by contagion: It is a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence
of too great a ma&s;s of animated matter
collected in one place. In every &s;pecies, there
are particular cau&s;es of death, as &s;hall afterwards
be &s;hown, which are &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the
exce&s;s of preceding generations.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t again remark, that this rea&s;oning is not
to be under&s;tood in an ab&s;olute or even in a &s;trict
&s;en&s;e, e&s;pecially with regard to tho&s;e &s;pecies which
are not left entirely to the guidance of Nature.
Man, and the other animals he has taken under
his protection and care, are more abundant than
they would be without that attention he be&s;tows
on them. But, as this care has al&s;o its limits,
the augmentation which re&s;ults from it, has long
been confined by immutable boundaries. And
<PB N="143" REF="184">
though, in civilized countries, the human &s;pecies,
as well as dome&s;tic animals, are more numerous
than in other climates, they never multiply to
exce&s;s; becau&s;e, whenever they become incom|modious,
their number is dimini&s;hed by the &s;ame
power that produced them.</P>
<P>In di&s;tricts appropriated to the plea&s;ures of the
chace, four or five hundred hares are &s;ometimes
killed in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle day's &s;port. The
multiplication of the&s;e animals is very rapid.
From the fir&s;t year of their exi&s;tence, they are
always in a condition for propagating. The fe|males
go with young only thirty or thirty-one
days. They bring forth three or four at a litter,
and, immediately afterwards, they receive the
male. They likewi&s;e admit him during the time
of ge&s;tation; and, from a peculiar conforma|tion
of their organs, they have frequent &s;uper|foetations:
For the uterus is only a continua|tion
of the vagina, and has neither neck nor o|rifice,
as in other animals; but, in each horn,
there is an orifice opening into the vagina, which
dilates during the time of bringing forth. Thus
the horns are two di&s;tinct uteri, which can act
independent of each other; &s;o that the females
of this &s;pecies are capable of conceiving and
bringing forth, at different times, by each ute|rus;
and, con&s;equently, &s;uperfoetations mu&s;t
be as frequent among the&s;e animals as they are
rare in tho&s;e which have not a double organ.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="185">
It is, therefore, apparent, that the female
hares may be in &s;ea&s;on and impregnated at all
times. Another &s;ingularity in their &s;tructure
proves them to be equally la&s;civious as they are
fertile. The glans of the clitoris is prominent,
and nearly as large as that of the male penis;
and, as the vulva is hardly vi&s;ible, and the male,
when young, has neither &s;crotum nor te&s;ticles on
the out&s;ide of the body, it is often difficult to
di&s;tingui&s;h the females from the males. This
peculiarity of &s;tructure has given ri&s;e to the fol|lowing
notions: That hermophradite hares are
very common; that the males &s;ometimes bring
forth young; and that &s;ome are alternately males
and females, and perform the functions of ei|ther
&s;ex, becau&s;e the females, being more ardent
than the males, often mount upon them, and be|cau&s;e
the external re&s;emblance is &s;o great, that,
unle&s;s narrowly examined, the one may ea&s;ily
be mi&s;taken for the other.</P>
<P>The young, when brought forth, have their
eyes open. The mother &s;uckles them about
twenty days; after which they &s;eparate, and pro|cure
their own food. They never remove far
from each other, nor from the place where they
are littered. They live, however, in &s;olitude,
each making a form or &s;eat at the di&s;tance of
&s;ixty or eighty paces. Thus, when we meet with
one young hare, we are almo&s;t certain of find|ing
two or three others in the neighbourhood.
They feed more in the night than in the day;
<PB N="145" REF="186">
they eat herbs, roots, leaves, fruit, grain, pre|ferring
tho&s;e plants which have milky juices.
During winter, they gnaw the bark indi&s;crimi|nately
from all trees, excepting that of the al|der
and lime, which they never touch. When
reared in hou&s;es, they are fed with lettuce and
pot-herbs: But the fle&s;h of tho&s;e fed hares is al|ways
bad ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>During the day, they &s;leep or repo&s;e in their
form, and are active only in the night, when
they move about, feed, and copulate. When
the moon &s;hines, they are &s;een playing toge|ther,
leaping and chacing each other. The &s;mall|e&s;t
motion, or the noi&s;e of a falling leaf, is &s;uf|ficient
to terrify and make them fly different
ways.</P>
<P>Some authors maintain, that hares chew the
cud. But I cannot a&s;&s;ent to this opinion; be|cau&s;e
they have one &s;tomach only, and its con|formation,
as well as that of the other inte&s;tines,
are totally different from tho&s;e of ruminating
animals. The caecum of the latter is &s;mall, but
that of the hare is very large; and, when to the
capacity of the &s;tomach this large caecum is
added, it is ea&s;y to perceive that this animal, by
taking a great quantity of aliment, may live up|on
herbs alone, like the hor&s;e and a&s;s, which
have al&s;o a large caecum, and but one &s;tomach,
and, con&s;equently, are incapable of ruminating.</P>
<P>Hares &s;leep much, but always with open eyes.
They have neither eye-lids nor cilia, and their
<PB N="146" REF="187">
eyes &s;eem to be bad. But, as a remuneration,
they have an acute &s;en&s;e of hearing, and enor|mous
ears in proportion to the &s;ize of their bo|dies.
The&s;e long ears they move with great fa|cility,
and employ them as a rudder to direct
their cour&s;e, which is &s;o rapid, that they out&s;trip
all other animals. As their fore legs are much
&s;horter than the hind legs, they run ea&s;ier up
than down hill; hence, when pur&s;ued, they al|ways
take to the highe&s;t grounds. Their run|ning
is a kind of gallop, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of quick
leaps. Their motion is not accompanied with
noi&s;e; becau&s;e their feet are covered, both above
and below, with hair. They are perhaps the
only animals which have hair in the in&s;ide of
the mouth.</P>
<P>The duration of their life, like that of other
animals, is proportioned to the time of their
growth, which is completed in one year, and
they live about &s;even. The males are &s;aid to
live longer than the females. They pa&s;s their
days in &s;olitude and &s;ilence; and their voice is
never heard but when &s;eized or wounded: It is
a loud, &s;harp cry, having &s;ome re&s;emblance to
the human voice. They are not &s;o &s;avage as
their manners and habits would indicate: They
are gentle, and &s;u&s;ceptible of a kind of education.
Though ea&s;ily tamed, and even rendered care&s;|&s;ing,
they never acquire that attachment which
is nece&s;&s;ary to make them dome&s;tic; for, when
taken young, and brought up in the hou&s;e, they
<PB N="147" REF="188">
take the fir&s;t opportunity of regaining their li|berty,
and of flying to the fields. As they have
a fine ear, &s;it &s;pontaneou&s;ly on their hind legs,
and u&s;e the fore legs as a kind of hands, they
have been trained to beat a drum, to perform
ge&s;tures in cadence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In general, the hare wants neither in&s;tinct
&s;ufficient for his own pre&s;ervation, nor &s;agacity
for e&s;caping his enemies. He forms a &s;eat or
ne&s;t: In winter, he choo&s;es &s;ituations expo&s;ed
to the &s;outh, and, in &s;ummer, to the north.
With a view to deceive, he conceals him&s;elf be|tween
clods or hillocks of the &s;ame colour with
that of his own hair. 'I have &s;een,' &s;ays Fouil|loux,
'a hare &s;o &s;agacious, that, after hearing
the hunter's horn, he &s;tarted from his form,
and, though at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a
league, went to &s;wim in a pool, and lay
down on the ru&s;hes in the middle of it,
without being chaced by the dogs. I have
&s;een a hare, after running two hours before
the dogs, pu&s;h another from his &s;eat, and take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. I have &s;een others &s;wim over
two or three ponds, the narrowe&s;t of which was
eighty paces broad. I have &s;een others, after a
two hours chace, run into a &s;heep-fold and lie
down among them. I have &s;een others, when
hard pu&s;hed, run in among a flock of &s;heep,
and would not leave them. I have &s;een others,
after hearing the noi&s;e of the hounds, conceal
them&s;elves in the earth. I have &s;een others
<PB N="148" REF="189">
run up one &s;ide of a hedge and return by the
other, when there was nothing el&s;e between
them and the dogs. I have &s;een others, after
running half an hour, mount an old wall, &s;ix
feet high, and clap down in a hole covered with
ivy. La&s;tly, I have &s;een others &s;wim over a
river of about eighty paces broad, more than
two times, in a length of two hundred paces.'</P>
<P>But the&s;e facts unque&s;tionably exhibit the
greate&s;t efforts of their in&s;tinct; for their ordi|nary
re&s;ources are not &s;o fine nor &s;o complicated:
When pur&s;ued, they fir&s;t run with rapidity, and
then double, or return upon their former &s;teps.
They always run in the direction that the wind
blows. The females run not &s;o far from their
place of &s;tarting as the males; but they double
oftener. In general, hares hunted in the place
that gave them birth, never remove to a great
di&s;tance from it, but return to their form; and,
if chaced two days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, they perform, in
the &s;econd day, the &s;ame doublings they had ob|&s;erved
the day before. When a hare runs
&s;traight out, and to a great di&s;tance from the
place he &s;tarted, it is a proof that he is a &s;tran|ger.
It often happens, that male hares, e&s;pecial|ly
during the mo&s;t remarkable period of rutting,
which is in the months of January, February,
and March, when they have few females near
them, perform journies of &s;everal leagues in
que&s;t of mates; but, as &s;oon as they are &s;tarted
by the dogs, they fly back to the place of their
<PB N="149" REF="190">
nativity, and never more return. The females
wander not in this manner. Though longer
than the males, they are weaker and le&s;s agile:
But they are more timid; for they never allow
the dogs to come &s;o near their &s;eats as the males,
and their doublings are more frequent. They
are al&s;o more delicate, and more &s;u&s;ceptible of
impre&s;&s;ions from the weather. They avoid wa|ter
and dews. But there are males called <HI>mea&s;|led
hares,</HI> which love mar&s;hy and watery grounds.
The fle&s;h of the&s;e hares is bad ta&s;ted; and, in
general, the fle&s;h of all hares which inhabit val|leys,
is whiti&s;h and in&s;ipid; but tho&s;e of elevated
or hilly countries, where the wild thime and o|ther
&s;avory herbs abound, are extremely good.
It has even been remarked, that tho&s;e which live
in the low woody grounds of the &s;ame country,
are not near &s;o good as tho&s;e that inhabit the
ridges of hills, or the cultivated fields, and vine-yards;
and that the fle&s;h of the female is always
more delicate than that of the male.</P>
<P>The nature of the &s;oil has a con&s;iderable influ|ence
on the hare, as well as upon all other ani|mals.
The mountain hares are larger than tho&s;e
of the plains, and likewi&s;e of a different colour.
The former are browner, and have more white
under the neck than the latter, which are almo&s;t
red. In high mountains, and in northern re|gions,
they become white during winter, and
re&s;ume their u&s;ual colour in the &s;ummer. Only
a few, and perhaps the&s;e are very old, continue
<PB N="150" REF="191">
white; for they all turn more or le&s;s white with
age. The hares of Italy, Spain, and Barbary,
are &s;maller than tho&s;e of France and other nor|thern
nations. According to Ari&s;totle, they are
&s;maller in Egypt than in Greece.</P>
<P>Hares are equally diffu&s;ed over all climates.
They abound in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Ru&s;|&s;ia,
France, Britain, Germany, Barbary, Egypt,
the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and particularly
Delos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. des I&s;les de l'Archipel de Dapper, p. 375.</NOTE>, which was called <HI>Lagaia</HI> by the antient
Greeks, becau&s;e of the number of hares which
were found there. La&s;tly, hares are numerous
in Lapland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Les Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 180. Il genio va|gante, tom. 2. p. 46. Voyage de la Martiniere, p. 74.</NOTE>, where they are white for ten
months of the year, and re&s;ume their proper co|lour
only during the two warm months of &s;um|mer.
Hence it appears, that every climate is
nearly equal to the&s;e animals. It has, however,
been remarked, that they are le&s;s frequent in
the Ea&s;t than in Europe, and that they are very
rare in South America, though they again make
their appearance in Virginia, Canada<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">La relation de la Ga&s;pe&s;ie, par le P. le Clercq, p. 488. &amp;c.</NOTE>, in the
neighbourhood of Hud&s;on's bay<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage de Robert Lade, tom. 2. p. 317.</NOTE>, and the
&s;traits of Magellan. But the&s;e North American
hares are perhaps a different &s;pecies from ours;
for travellers inform us, that they are not only
much larger, but that their fle&s;h is white, and of
<PB N="151" REF="192">
a different ta&s;te from that of the common kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La &s;uite des voyages de Dampier, tom. 5. p. 167.</NOTE>.
They add, that the hair of the North American
hares never falls off, and that their &s;kins are ex|cellent,
furs. In exce&s;&s;ively hot countries, as Se|negal,
Gambia, Guiney<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Prev&ocirc;t, tom. 3. p. 235. 296.</NOTE>, and particularly in
the cantons of Fida, Apam, Agra, and &s;ome o|ther
regions &s;ituated under the Torrid Zone,
both in Africa and America, as in New Holland,
and the I&s;thmus of Panama, there are animals
which have been called <HI>hares</HI> by travellers, but
are rather a &s;pecies of rabbit<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier, vol. 4. p. 111. Wafer tom. 4. p. 224.</NOTE>; for the rabbit
is a native of warm climates, and is never found
very far to the north; but the hares are larger
and &s;tronger in proportion to the coldne&s;s of the
country they inhabit.</P>
<P>This animal, though &s;o much in reque&s;t for
the tables of Europeans, is not reli&s;hed by the
Oriental nations. The fle&s;h of the hare, it is
true, as well as that of the hog, was interdicted
by the law of Mahomet, and &s;till more antiently
by the Jewi&s;h law. But it was much e&s;teemed
by the Greeks and Romans: <HI>Inter quadrupedes,
gloria prima Lepus</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Martial.</NOTE>. It mu&s;t, indeed, be al|lowed,
that not only the fle&s;h, but the blood of
this animal is excellent. The fat contributes
nothing to the delicacy of the fle&s;h; for the
hare, in his natural &s;tate of perfect liberty, is
<PB N="152" REF="193">
never fat; but, when fed in the hou&s;e, he often
dies merely by the load of fat he acquires.</P>
<P>The hunting of the hare is the amu&s;ement,
and not unfrequently the &s;ole occupation of the
idle: As it requires little apparatus or expence,
and is even u&s;eful, it is a diver&s;ion univer&s;ally
agreeable. In the mornings and evenings, the
hunter watches, at the edges of the wood, the
going out or returning of the hares. During
the day, he &s;earches for them in their forms.
When the air is clear and the &s;un brilliant, an
expert hunter will di&s;cover, at a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance,
a hare that has been chanced, by the fumes
which ari&s;e from its body. Conducted by this
mark, I have &s;een men, who&s;e eyes were accu|&s;tomed
to this kind of ob&s;ervation, part from
their company, and go to the di&s;tance of half a
league to kill a hare in its &s;eat. Hares allow a
very near approach, if they are not advanced
upon directly, but by a winding and &s;eemingly in|attentive
motion. They are more afraid of dogs
than of men, and &s;tart &s;ooner when they hear
or perceive a dog. Though the hares run fa&s;t|er
than the dogs; yet, as they never fly &s;traight
out, but double about the place where they were
&s;tarted, the grey hounds, who hunt more by the
eye than the &s;cent, generally overtake and kill
them. In &s;ummer, they frequent the fields, the
vineyards in autumn, and the woods or coppices
in winter; and, in all &s;ea&s;ons, they may be rai|&s;ed
and chaced by hounds. They may al&s;o be
<PB N="153" REF="194">
taken by birds of prey. A perpetual war is car|ried
on again&s;t them by owls, buzzards, eagles,
foxes, wolves, and men. So numerous are their
enemies, that they e&s;cape only by chance, and
are rarely allowed to enjoy the &s;mall protion of
time allotted them by Nature.</P>

<P>It is univer&s;ally known, that hares make forms,
and burrow not in the ground, like rabbits. But
I have been informed by an able naturali&s;t, M.
Hettlinger, &s;uperintendant of the Pyrennean
mines, that, in the mountains in the neighbour|hood
of Baigory, the hares often make holes in
the clefts of rocks, which is not con&s;idered as
remarkable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from M. Hettlinger to M. de Bu&s;&s;on, dated at Baigory, July 16. 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e well known, that hares do not
willingly inhabit places which are frequented by
rabbits; but it al&s;o appears, that rabbits do not
multiply in countries where hares are numerous:</P>
<P>'In Norway,' &s;ays Pontoppidon, 'rabbits are
found only in a few places; but hares are
very frequent. Their hair, which is brown
and grey during &s;ummer, becomes white in
winter. <HI>Like cats, they take and eat mice,</HI> and
are of a &s;maller &s;ize than tho&s;e of Denmark<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidou's Nat. hi&s;t. of Norway.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="195">
That hares eat mice, is extremely improbable:
But it is not the only marvellous or fal&s;e fact
related by the good Bi&s;hop of Bergen.</P>
<P>'The hares of the I&s;le of France,' remarks
M. le Vicomte de Querho&euml;nt, 'are not larger
than French rabbits. Their fle&s;h is white, and
they burrow not in the ground. They are very
numerous; their hair is &s;moother than that of
our hares; and they have a large black &s;pot

Senegal are not entirely &s;imilar to tho&s;e of

<P>AS the hare and rabbit, though very &s;imilar
both in external form and internal &s;truc|ture,
never intermix, they con&s;titute two di&s;tinct
&s;pecies. However, as it has been maintained by
hunters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">La Venerie de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</NOTE>, that male hares, in the rutting &s;ea|&s;on,
pur&s;ue and cover female rabbits, I endea|voured
to di&s;cover what would re&s;ult from this
union. For this purpo&s;e, I reared together male
rabbits and female hares, and female rabbits and
male hares. But nothing was produced from
the&s;e trials. I only learned from them, that
<PB N="156" REF="198">
the&s;e animals, though very &s;imilar in form, are
&s;o different in their natures, as to be incapable of
producing mules. I put a young hare and a
young female rabbit in the &s;ame apartment; but
they lived not together three months. As &s;oon
as they acquired a little &s;trength, they became
mortal enemies; and their continual wars ter|minated
in the death of the hare. Of two male
hares farther advanced in life, which I confined
&s;eparately with a female rabbit, one &s;uffered the
&s;ame fate; and the other, which was very &s;trong,
and very ardent, perpetually tormented the rab|bit
with attempts to cover her, and at la&s;t killed
her by wounds, or by too violent care&s;&s;es. I
made &s;imilar trials with three or four male rab|bits,
and an equal number of female hares; but
the latter died in a &s;till &s;horter time. Though
nothing was produced, I am inclined to think
that they &s;ometimes actually coupled. It is cer|tain,
at lea&s;t, that, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;i&s;tance
of the female, the male was gratified: And it
was more rea&s;onable to expect fruit from the&s;e
mixtures than from that of the rabbit and hen,
which, according to a certain author, would pro|duce
<HI>chickens covered with hair, or rabbits co|vered
with feathers</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'art d'elever des poulets.</NOTE>. This ridiculous conclu|&s;ion
was drawn from a vicious male rabbit, which,
having no female, u&s;ed a hen in the &s;ame man|ner
as he would any other moveable. It was
extremely improbable, that two &s;pecies, &s;o
<PB N="157" REF="199">
remote from each other, &s;hould be fertile, while
nothing re&s;ults from the union of the hare and
rabbit, who&s;e &s;pecies are &s;o very analogous.</P>
<P>The fecundity of the rabbit is &s;till greater than
that of the hare. Without believing, with Wot|ton,
that, from a &s;ingle pair put upon an i&s;land,
&s;ix millions were found at the end of one year,
it is certain that the&s;e animals multiply &s;o pro|digiou&s;ly
in a country which is commodious for
them, that the produce of the earth is not &s;uf|ficient
to afford them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They devour
herbs, roots, grain, fruits, and even young trees
and &s;hrubs; and, if not furni&s;hed with dogs
and ferrets, the inhabitants would be obliged to
de&s;ert the&s;e countries. The rabbit not only pro|duces
more frequently, and in greater number
than the hare, but has likewi&s;e more re&s;ources
for e&s;caping his enemies. He ea&s;ily ab&s;tracts
him&s;elf from the ob&s;ervation of man. The
holes which he digs in the earth, where he re|tires
during the day, and impregnates his mate,
protect him from the ravages of the wolf, the
fox, and birds of prey. Here the whole family
live in perfect &s;ecurity. The females nouri&s;h
their young about two months, and never allow
them to go out of their retreat till they are able
to &s;hift for them&s;elves. By this means, they a|void
all the dangers of youth; while more hares,
on the contrary, are de&s;troyed during this period
than in all the after part of their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="200">
This management is alone &s;ufficient to prove
that the rabbit is &s;uperior in &s;agacity to the
hare. The &s;tructure of both is the &s;ame, and
might enable them equally to dig retreats in the
earth. Both are equally timid; but the talents
of the one being weaker than tho&s;e of the other,
he contents him&s;elf with forming a &s;eat on the
&s;urface of the ground, where he remains perpe|tually
expo&s;ed; while the rabbit, endowed with
a &s;uperior in&s;tinct, digs for him&s;elf an a&s;ylum in
the earth. This labour is unque&s;tionably the
effect of &s;entiment; for dome&s;tic rabbits never
give them&s;elves the trouble of digging. They
di&s;pen&s;e with digging retreats, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on
that dome&s;tic birds di&s;pen&s;e with building
ne&s;ts, becau&s;e they are equally &s;heltered from
the inconveniencies and dangers to which wild
birds and wild rabbits are continually liable. It
has often been remarked, that, when a warren is
attempted to be repleni&s;hed with dome&s;tic rabbits,
both they and their offspring remain, like the
hares, upon the &s;urface; and that they never be|gin
to dig holes for their protection, till after
they have endured many hard&s;hips, and pa&s;&s;ed
through &s;everal generations.</P>
<P>The colours of the dome&s;tic rabbit vary, like
tho&s;e of all other dome&s;tic animals; for we have
white, black, brown, and &s;potted rabbits. The
black rabbits are rarer than the white, brown, or
variegated kinds. All wild rabbits are brown;
and, even among the dome&s;tic ones, it is &s;till the
<PB N="159" REF="201">
predominant colour; for, in every litter, though
both male and female be white, or both black,
or the one white and the other black, &s;ome of
the young are always brown. It is &s;eldom that
above two or three re&s;emble the parents. But
the brown rabbits, though in a dome&s;tic &s;tate,
generally produce young of their own colour
only; and it is very rare, and as by accident,
that they bring forth white, black, or mixed
kinds.</P>
<P>At the age of five or &s;ix months, the&s;e animals
are capable of procreating. They are &s;aid to be
con&s;tant in their amours; and, after attaching
them&s;elves to a particular female, generally ne|ver
quit her. The female is almo&s;t perpetually
in a condition for receiving the male. She goes
with young thirty or thirty-one days, and pro|duces
from four to eight at a litter. Like the
female hare, &s;he has a double uterus, and con&s;e|quently
may bring forth at two different times.
Superfoetations, however, &s;eem to be le&s;s fre|quent
in this &s;pecies than in that of the hare.
This circum&s;tance may, perhaps, be owing to
the con&s;tancy of the females, and to their indulging
in fewer adventures and un&s;ea&s;onable embraces.</P>
<P>Some days before bringing forth, they dig a
new hole, not in a &s;traight line, but angular; at
the bottom of which they make an excavation;
and then pull great quantities of hair off their
bellies, and make a bed of it for the reception of
their young. During the two fir&s;t days, they
<PB N="160" REF="202">
never leave their offspring: They never go out
but when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, and return as &s;oon
as they have filled their &s;tomach, which they do
with &s;urpri&s;ing quickne&s;s. In this manner they
tend and &s;uckle their young for more than &s;ix
weeks, during which the father has no know|ledge
of them. He never enters the hole dug
by the mother; and the female, when &s;he leaves
her young, frequently &s;huts up the mouth of the
hole with earth diluted in her own urine. But,
when they begin to come to the mouth of the
hole, and to eat ground&s;el, or other herbs, pre|&s;ented
to them by the mother, the father &s;eems
to know them: He takes them between his
paws, &s;mooths their hair, and licks their eyes.
Each of them, one after another, equally partakes
of his care and attention. He receives, at the
&s;ame time, many care&s;&s;es from the mother;
and, in a few days afterwards, &s;he is generally
impregnated.</P>
<P>I received the following remarks from M. le
Chapt du Moutier, who has amu&s;ed him&s;elf for
&s;everal years in rearing rabbits: 'I began,' &s;ays
he, 'with only one male and one female. The
male was perfectly white, and the female
brown. In their po&s;terity, which was very nu|merous,
the brown greatly predominated; there
was a con&s;iderable number of them white and
mixed, and &s;ome black. When the female is
in &s;ea&s;on, the male &s;eldom quits her. His con|&s;titution
is &s;o vigorous and ardent, that I have
<PB N="161" REF="203">
&s;een him embrace the female five or &s;ix times
in le&s;s than an hour. In the time of coition,
the female lies flat on her belly, with her four
paws &s;tretched out; and &s;he utters &s;mall cries,
which rather indicate plea&s;ure than pain. Their
manner of coupling re&s;embles that of the cats,
with this difference, that the male bites the
neck of the female with le&s;s violence. The&s;e
animals pay much re&s;pect to their fathers,
which I di&s;covered by the great deference my
rabbits entertained for their original father, who
was ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by his whitene&s;s, being
the only male of this colour which I pre&s;erved.
The family &s;oon increa&s;ed: But tho&s;e who had
likewi&s;e become fathers, were always &s;ubordi|nate
to their fir&s;t &s;ire. Whenever they fought,
either for females or food, the grandfather ran
up to them with full &s;peed; and, as &s;oon as they
perceived him, order was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. If
he &s;urpri&s;ed them in the act, he fir&s;t &s;eparated
the combatants, and then gave them an exem|plary
puni&s;hment. I had &s;till a farther proof
of his dominion over his po&s;terity. Having
accu&s;tomed them to retire into their apartment
upon the blowing of a whi&s;tle, when I gave
the &s;ignal, however di&s;tant they might be, the
grandfather put him&s;elf at their head, and,
though he arrived fir&s;t, he allowed them all to
pa&s;s before, and entered la&s;t him&s;elf. I fed
them with bran, hay, and a good deal of juni|per;
<PB N="162" REF="204">
of this la&s;t, they eat the berries, the leaves,
the bark, and leave nothing but the wood.
This food gave a fine flavour to their fle&s;h,
and made it equally good as that of the wild
rabbit.'</P>
<P>The&s;e animals live eight or nine years. As
they pa&s;s the greate&s;t part of their lives in holes,
where they enjoy perfect tranquillity, they grow
much fatter than hares. Their fle&s;h differs like|wi&s;e
both in colour and ta&s;te. The fle&s;h of the
young rabbit is very delicate; but that of the
old is dry and hard. As I formerly remarked,
they are originally natives of warm climates.
They were known to the Greeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. animal. lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE>; Greece and
Spain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. 8.</NOTE> &s;eem to be the only places of Europe

<HEAD>OF
CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have treated of u&s;eful
animals only. The noxious &s;pecies are
few in number; and though, upon the whole,
what is hurtful &s;eems to abound more than what
is &s;erviceable, yet every thing is well ordered;
for, in the phy&s;ical world, evil is &s;ub&s;ervient to
good, and there is nothing really noxious in Na|ture.
If the de&s;truction of animals be hurtful,
is not man, con&s;idered as forming a part of the
general &s;y&s;tem of animation, the mo&s;t noxious
and pernicious of all beings? He alone &s;acri|fices
and annihilates more individuals than
the whole carnivorous tribes. The latter are
hurtful only, becau&s;e they are rivals to man, be|cau&s;e
they have the &s;ame appetites, the &s;ame
ta&s;te for animal food, and becau&s;e, in obedience
to this unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary de&s;ire, they
&s;ometimes di&s;pute with him that prey which he
would engro&s;s for the gratification of his inor|dinate
appetite; for man always &s;acrifices more
to his intemperance than to his real wants. Born
to de&s;troy the &s;ubordinate races of animals, he
would exhau&s;t all Nature, if, by a fecundity &s;u|perior
to his depredations, &s;he did not repair the
<PB N="165" REF="212">
perpetual havock he makes. But death is only
the mini&s;ter of life, and de&s;truction is the parent
of reproduction. However great, therefore, the
wa&s;te made by man and the carnivorous animals,
the fund or total quantity of life is never dimi|ni&s;hed;
for, in proportion to their premature
de&s;truction, fre&s;h births are produced.</P>
<P>Large animals con&s;titute but a &s;mall part of
life: The earth teems with the &s;maller tribes.
Every plant, every grain, every particle of orga|nized
matter, contains millions of animated a|toms.
Vegetables &s;eem to be the great fund of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but this fund, however inexhau&s;ti|ble,
would hardly be &s;ufficient to the &s;till more
numerous tribes of in&s;ects. Their fecundity,
which is equally great, and often quicker than
the reproduction of plants, indicates the &s;uperi|ority
of their numbers: For plants are only re|newed
every year; but a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on gives
birth to &s;everal generations of in&s;ects, e&s;pecially
among the minuter tribes. Their multiplication,
therefore, if they were not devoured by other
animals, would exceed that of vegetables. But
many in&s;ects feed upon other in&s;ects: Some
tribes, as the &s;peeders, devour indifferently their
own as well as many other &s;pecies; the whole
are eaten by the birds; and the wild and do|me&s;tic
fowls &s;erve for nouri&s;hment to man, or
become the prey of carnivorous animals. Thus
violent deaths are equally nece&s;&s;ary as natural
ones: They are both modes of de&s;truction and
<PB N="166" REF="213">
of reproduction; the one continues Nature in
perpetual youth, and the other pre&s;erves the or|der
of her productions, and limits the number
of &s;pecies. Both are effects depending upon ge|neral
cau&s;es: Every individual drops at the end
of a determined period; or, if prematurely cut
off, it was becau&s;e he was &s;uperfluous. How
many flowers are cropped in the &s;pring? What
numberle&s;s beings are extingui&s;hed the moment
they begin to exi&s;t? How many germs are an|nihilated
before they are unfolded? Man and
the carnivorous animals feed upon individuals
either completely formed, or about to exi&s;t.
Fle&s;h, eggs, &s;eeds, and germs of every &s;pecies,
con&s;titute their ordinary nouri&s;hment. This
wa&s;te alone might limit the exuberance of Na|ture.
Let us attend to one of tho&s;e inferior &s;pe|cies
that &s;erve for nouri&s;hment to others. The
herrings, for example, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in my|riads
to our fi&s;hers; and, after feeding all the
mon&s;ters of the northern ocean, they furni&s;h
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence to Europe during a certain part of the
year. If incredible numbers of them were not
devoured by other animals, what would be the
effects of &s;uch an amazing multiplication? They
alone would cover the whole &s;urface of the &s;ea.
But, by their numbers, they would &s;oon injure
and de&s;troy each other. For want of &s;ufficient
nouri&s;hment, their fecundity would dimini&s;h.
Contagion and famine would produce the &s;ame
effects as the pre&s;ent con&s;umption; the number
<PB N="167" REF="214">
of the&s;e animals would by no means increa&s;e;
but the number of tho&s;e who feed upon them
would greatly dimini&s;h. And, as the &s;ame re|mark
may be applied to any other &s;pecies, they
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity prey upon one another: Hence
the killing of animals is both a lawful and an
innocent practice, becau&s;e it is founded in na|ture,
and they hold their exi&s;tence under that
&s;eemingly hard condition.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, however, that the motives
which have rai&s;ed doubts concerning this matter,
do honour to humanity. Animals, at lea&s;t tho&s;e
who are endowed with &s;en&s;es, and are compo&s;ed
of fle&s;h and blood, are &s;en&s;itive beings: Like us,
they are capable of plea&s;ure, and &s;ubject to pain.
To &s;acrifice unnece&s;&s;arily tho&s;e animals who ap|proach
or live with us, and who, like man, ex|hibit
&s;ymptoms of pain when injured, indicates
a cruel in&s;en&s;ibility; for tho&s;e who&s;e nature dif|fers
greatly from ours, cannot affect us. Natu|ral
pity is founded on the analogy which takes
place between us and the object that &s;uffers, and
the degree of it is proportioned to the nearne&s;s
of this conformity or re&s;emblance in &s;tructure.
The word <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> implies a divi&s;ion of &s;uffer|ing.
In man, the &s;entiment of pity belongs more
to the body than to the mind; and the animals
are al&s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of it. They are moved by
the voice of pain; they run to &s;uccour each o|ther;
they recoil at the view of a dead body of
their own &s;pecies. Thus horror and pity are not
<PB N="168" REF="215">
&s;o much pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, as natural affec|tions
depending on the &s;en&s;ibility of the body,
and &s;imilarity of &s;tructure. This emotion, there|fore,
ought to dimini&s;h in proportion as different
animals recede from each other in their nature
and conformation. The beating of a dog, or
the killing of a lamb, excite our compa&s;&s;ion:
But we feel no emotion when a tree is felled or
an oy&s;ter &s;wallowed.</P>
<P>Animals, who&s;e organization re&s;embles that
of man, mu&s;t have &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations; and the
liveline&s;s of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t be proportion|ed
to the activity and perfection of their &s;en&s;es.
Tho&s;e, on the other hand, who&s;e &s;en&s;es are blunt,
cannot have exqui&s;ite feelings; and tho&s;e who
are deprived of any organ of &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
want the corre&s;pondent &s;en&s;ations. Mo|tion
is a nece&s;&s;ary effect of the exerci&s;e of &s;enti|ment.
We formerly proved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sec above, di&s;cour&s;e on the nature of animals, vol. 3. p. 208.</NOTE>, that, whatever be
the organization of an animal, if it be endowed
with &s;entiment, it mu&s;t exhibit its feelings by
external movements. Thus plants, though pro|perly
organized, are in&s;en&s;ible beings, as well as
tho&s;e animals who have no apparent motion. In
the &s;ame manner, animals, who, like the &s;en&s;i|tive
plant, only move their bodies, but are de|prived
of progre&s;&s;ive motion, have very little
&s;entiment; and even tho&s;e who are endowed
with the power of moving progre&s;&s;ively, but
who&s;e actions, like tho&s;e of automations, are ex|tremely
<PB N="169" REF="216">
limited in number, and always perform|ed
in the &s;ame manner, have only a &s;mall por|tion
of &s;entiment, which is confined to a few
objects. In the human &s;pecies, there are many
automatons: Education, and the mutual com|munication
of ideas, by means of &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e,
augment both the quantity and the viva|city
of our &s;entiments. What a va&s;t difference,
in this re&s;pect, between a &s;avage and a civilized
man, between a female Hottentot and a woman
of fa&s;hion? Among the animals, in like manner,
tho&s;e who live in a dome&s;tic &s;tate have their feel|ings
improved by their frequent intercour&s;e with
man; while tho&s;e who remain wild pre&s;erve
only their natural &s;en&s;ibility, which is often
more certain, but always more confined than that
which is acquired by education and example.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, con&s;idering &s;entiment entirely as a
natural faculty, independent of the movements
produced by it, we may &s;till a&s;certain its differ|ent
degrees by phy&s;ical relations, to which too
little attention has hitherto been given. To po&s;|&s;e&s;s
a high degree of &s;en&s;ibility, the animated
body mu&s;t form a whole, not only &s;en&s;ible in all
its parts, but &s;o con&s;tructed that the&s;e parts inti|mately
corre&s;pond with each other, in &s;uch a
manner, that an impre&s;&s;ion made upon one,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be communicated to all the re&s;t.
There mu&s;t al&s;o be a common centre, upon which
the various impre&s;&s;ions or vibrations mu&s;t ter|minate,
and this centre mu&s;t, like a fulcrum,
<PB N="170" REF="217">
re-act, and reflect all the&s;e movements. Thus
man, and tho&s;e animals who re&s;emble him mo&s;t
in organization, will be the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible beings.
Tho&s;e, on the contrary, who form not &s;o com|plete
a whole, who&s;e parts have a le&s;s intimate
corre&s;pondence, who have &s;everal centres of
feeling, and who, under the &s;ame covering, &s;eem
not to include one perfect animal, but various
centres of exi&s;tence &s;eparate from each other,
are beings of much le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility. When a
polypus is cut in pieces, each divi&s;ion lives &s;epa|rately;
the head of a wa&s;p, after being divided
from the body, lives, moves, and even eats as
formerly; a lizard, though cut a&s;under, is nei|ther
deprived of motion nor of feeling; the
limbs of a lob&s;ter are renewed after amputation;
the heart of a turtle continues to beat long after
being cut out of the body; the principal vi&s;cera
of in&s;ects, as the heart and lungs, make not a
whole in the centre of the&s;e animals, but extend
along the body, and form a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of un|connected
hearts and wind-pipes: All the&s;e, and
&s;imilar animals, who&s;e organization is &s;o far re|moved
from that of man, have little &s;entiment.</P>
<P>In man, and in the animals which re&s;emble him,
the diaphragm appears to be the centre of &s;enti|ment:
It is upon this nervous part, which con|veys
the impre&s;&s;ion of pain and of plea&s;ure, that
all the movements of the &s;en&s;ible &s;y&s;tem are ex|erted.
The diaphragm makes a tran&s;ver&s;e divi|&s;ion
of the body into two equal parts, the &s;upe|rior
<PB N="171" REF="218">
of which includes the heart and lungs, and
the inferior contains the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.
This membrane is endowed with &s;uch an extreme
&s;en&s;ibility, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the communi|cation
and propagation of feeling, that the &s;light|e&s;t
wound, whether in its centre or circumfe|rence,
is always accompanied with convul&s;ions,
and often with death. The brain, therefore,
which has been con&s;idered as the &s;eat of &s;en&s;a|tion,
is by no means the centre of &s;entiment;
for it may be wounded, and even parts of it cut
away, without de&s;troying the animal.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ation, therefore, ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from &s;entiment. Sen&s;ation is only a vibration,
or impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;e; but &s;entiment is the
&s;ame &s;en&s;ation rendered agreeable and di&s;agree|able
by the propagation of the vibration through
the &s;y&s;tem. The e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of &s;en|timent
is plea&s;ure or pain; for all other move|ments,
though they pa&s;s within us, are totally
indifferent, and do not affect us. All the exter|nal
motions, and the exerci&s;e of every animal
force, depend on &s;entiment, which only acts in
proportion as it is affected. The diaphragm,
therefore, which we con&s;ider as the centre of
&s;entiment, is al&s;o the centre of force, or common
fulcrum upon which every force is exerted.</P>
<P>All lively emotions, whether plea&s;ant or pain|ful,
&s;ickne&s;s, fainting, and every &s;en&s;ation that
has become agreeable or di&s;agreeable, are felt
internally in the region of the diaphragm. In
<PB N="172" REF="219">
the brain, on the contrary, there is no indication
of &s;entiment. We feel only pure &s;en&s;ations in
the head. We can, indeed, recal any &s;en&s;ation,
whether agreeable or di&s;agreeable; and, if this
operation, which is performed in the head, be
followed by a real and lively &s;entiment, we im|mediately
feel the impre&s;&s;ion of it in the region
of the diaphragm. Thus, in the foetus, where
this membrane is not exerci&s;ed, there is no &s;en|timent,
or at lea&s;t it is &s;o feeble as to produce
no effect; for the little motions of a foetus are
mechanical, and have no dependence either on
&s;en&s;ation or on the will.</P>
<P>Whatever be the nature of that matter, which
&s;erves as a vehicle to &s;entiment, and gives ri&s;e
to mu&s;cular motion, we know that it is pro|pagated
by the nerves, and that it is in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly
communicated from one extremity of the
&s;y&s;tem to the other. We know not how this
movement is performed, whether by vibrations
like tho&s;e of ela&s;tic cords, or by a &s;ubtile fire &s;i|milar
to that of electricity, which re&s;ides not
only in animated and unanimated bodies, but is
perpetually regenerated by the motion of the
heart and lungs, by the friction of the blood in
the arteries, and al&s;o by the action of external
cau&s;es upon the organs of &s;en&s;e. It is certain,
however, that the nerves and membranes are the
only &s;en&s;ible parts of an animal body. The
blood, the lymph, the fat, the bones, the fle&s;h,
and all the other &s;olids and fluids are, in them|&s;elves,
<PB N="173" REF="220">
totally in&s;en&s;ible. The brain is a &s;oft
unela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance, and, of cour&s;e, incapable of
producing or of propagating the vibrations of
&s;entiment. The meninges, on the contrary,
which &s;erve as an envelope or covering to all the
nerves, are exceedingly &s;en&s;ible. Like the nerves,
the meninges originate in the head, and, like
them, they divide into branches, and extend a|long
with their mo&s;t minute ramifications. They
may be regarded as nerves rendered flat; for
they are of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, have nearly the
&s;ame degree of ela&s;ticity, and form a nece&s;&s;ary
part of the &s;en&s;ible &s;y&s;tem. If the head, there|fore,
be the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation, it mu&s;t re&s;ide in
the meninges, and not in the medullary part of
the brain, the &s;ub&s;tance of which is entirely dif|ferent.</P>
<P>The opinion, that the brain is the fountain of
&s;en&s;ation, and the centre of all &s;en&s;ibility, aro&s;e
from this circum&s;tance, that the whole nerves,
which are the organs of &s;en&s;ation, terminate in
the brain; and hence it was regarded as the only
part fitted to receive every impre&s;&s;ion or vibra|tion.
This &s;uppo&s;ition appeared &s;o &s;imple and
&s;o natural, that the phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility which
it implies, though abundantly evident, was ne|ver
attended to: How can an in&s;en&s;ible part, a
&s;oft inactive &s;ub&s;tance, &s;uch as the brain, be it|&s;elf
the in&s;trument of all &s;en&s;ation and motion?
How can this &s;oft in&s;en&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance not only
receive impre&s;&s;ions, but retain them for a long
<PB N="174" REF="221">
time, and propagate vibrations through all the
&s;olid and &s;en&s;ible parts of the body? It may,
perhaps, be replied, with De&s;cartes and Peyronie,
that the principle of &s;en&s;ation re&s;ides not in the
brain, but in the pineal gland, or in the cortical
&s;ub&s;tance. But, from examining the parts of
the brain, it is apparent, that neither the pineal
gland nor cortical &s;ub&s;tance contain nerves: They
are &s;urrounded with the in&s;en&s;ible part of the
brain, and &s;o &s;eparated from the nerves, that they
can receive none of their movements. Hence
the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, as well as the former, fall to
the ground.</P>
<P>But what is the u&s;e, what are the functions
of this noble and principal part of the body? Is
not the brain found in every animal? Is it not
larger in man, in the quadrupeds, and in the
birds, who have all a great deal of &s;entiment,
than in fi&s;hes, in&s;ects, and other animals which
have little &s;entiment? When compre&s;&s;ed, is
not all motion &s;u&s;pended? If this part is not the
principle of action, why is it &s;o e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary?
Why is it even proportioned, in every
&s;pecies of animals, to the quantity of &s;entiment
they po&s;&s;e&s;s?</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions, however difficult they may
appear, admit of ea&s;y &s;olutions. Upon an at|tentive
and unprejudiced examination, the brain,
as well as the medulla oblongata, and &s;pinal
marrow, which is a prolongation of the brain,
are only a &s;pecies of mucilage, and hardly orga|nized.
<PB N="175" REF="222">
We di&s;cover in it, indeed, the extremi|ties
of &s;mall arteries, which terminate there in
va&s;t numbers, and carry no blood, but only a
white nutritious lymph. The&s;e minute arteries,
or lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, when &s;eparated from the
brain by maceration, appear like very fine threads.
The nerves, on the contrary, never penetrate the
&s;ub&s;tance of the brain, but terminate on its &s;ur|face;
but they fir&s;t lo&s;e their &s;olidity and ela&s;ti|city;
and their extremities next the brain are &s;oft,
and almo&s;t mucilaginous. Hence the brain,
which is nouri&s;hed by the lymphatic arteries,
furni&s;hes, in its turn, nutriment to the nerves,
which ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of ve|getation
i&s;&s;uing from the brain in trunks and
branches, which afterwards divide into an infi|nite
number of ramifications. The brain is to
the nerves, what the &s;oil is to plants: The ex|tremities
of the nerves are the roots which, in
every vegetable, are more tender and &s;oft than
the trunk or branches. They contain a ductile
matter proper for the growth and nouri&s;hment
of the nervous tree. This ductile matter they
derive from the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain it&s;elf, to
which the arteries perpetually carry the nece&s;|&s;ary
&s;upplies of lymph. The brain, therefore,
in&s;tead of being the origin of &s;en&s;ation, or the
principle of &s;entiment, is only an organ of &s;ecre|tion
and nutrition, but a very e&s;&s;ential organ;
for, without it, the nerves would neither grow
nor be &s;upported.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="223">
The brain is large&s;t in man, quadrupeds, and
birds; becau&s;e the quantity of nerves is great|er
than in the fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, who&s;e &s;entiment,
for this rea&s;on, is feeble: The latter have a &s;mall
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, proportioned to the &s;mall quantity of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it has to nouri&s;h. On this occa&s;ion, I
must remark, that man's brain, as has been al|ledged,
is not proportionally larger than that of
any other animal: There are &s;pecies of monkeys
and of the cetaceous tribes which have larger
brains, in proportion to the &s;ize of their bodies,
than man: And this fact likewi&s;e proves, that
the brain is neither the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation, nor the
principle of &s;entiment; for, if this were the ca&s;e,
the&s;e animals would have finer &s;en&s;ations and
more &s;entiment than the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Plants ab&s;orb not the &s;olid parts of earth
or water: The&s;e parts mu&s;t be reduced by
heat into thin vapours, before they can be ab|&s;orbed
by the roots. In the &s;ame manner, the
nerves are nouri&s;hed by the &s;ubtile moi&s;ture of
the brain, which is ab&s;orbed by their extremi|ties
or roots, and from thence conveyed to all
the branches of the &s;en&s;itive &s;y&s;tem. This &s;y&s;|tem,
as formerly remarked, forms a whole, all
the parts of which have &s;uch an intimate con|nection,
that none of them can be injured with|out
wounding the whole. The &s;lighte&s;t irrita|tion
of a &s;mall nerve, is &s;ufficient to convul&s;e the
whole body; and the pain and con&s;equent con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ions
cannot be cured but by cutting the nerve
<PB N="177" REF="224">
above the injured part; and then all the parts
upon which this nerve was di&s;tributed, become
for ever immoveable and in&s;en&s;ible. The brain
ought not to be regarded as an organic portion
of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; becau&s;e it has not the
&s;ame properties, nor con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance,
being neither &s;olid, nor ela&s;tic, nor &s;en&s;ible.
I acknowledge, that, when compre&s;&s;ed, &s;en&s;ation
cea&s;es. But this alone proves it to be a body
foreign to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which, acting by
its gravity on the extremities of the nerves, pre&s;|&s;es
and benumbs them, in the &s;ame manner as a
weight applied to the arm, leg, or any other part
of the body, benumbs the nerves, and annihilates
their &s;en&s;ation. It is true, this ce&s;&s;ation of feel|ing,
by compre&s;&s;ion, is only a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or a
benumbing, which vani&s;hes the moment the com|pre&s;&s;ion
is removed, and &s;en&s;ation and motion
are again renewed. I farther acknowledge, that,
by tearing the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain,
convul&s;ions, privation of feeling, and death it&s;elf,
will en&s;ue. But the&s;e effects are produced, be|cau&s;e
the nerves are entirely deranged, and the
whole of them materially injured in their very
&s;ource.</P>
<P>To the&s;e arguments particular facts might be
added, which would equally demon&s;trate that
the brain is neither the centre of &s;entiment, nor
the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation. We have &s;een animals,
and even children, born without head or brain,
and yet had &s;entiment, motion, and life. There
are whole cla&s;&s;es of animals, as in&s;ects and worms,
<PB N="178" REF="225">
in whom the brain is not perceptible, having
only a part corre&s;ponding to the medulla oblon|gata
and &s;pinal marrow. It is, therefore, more
rational to place the &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation in the &s;pi|nal
marrow, which no animal wants, than in the
brain, which is not an univer&s;al part, common to
all &s;en&s;itive beings.</P>
<P>The great ob&s;tacle to the advancement of hu|man
knowledge, lies not in the objects them|&s;elves,
but in our manner of con&s;idering them.
Man's body, however complicated, is more &s;imple
than his ideas. It is le&s;s difficult to &s;ee Nature
as &s;he is, than to know her in the dre&s;s &s;he is
exhibited to us. She only wears a veil; but we
give her a ma&s;k. We conceal her with prejudi|ces.
We &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he operates as we act and
think. Her actions, however, are evident; but
our thoughts are ob&s;cure. To her operations
we transfer the ab&s;tractions of our own minds.
We judge of her de&s;igns by our own views;
and we perpetually blend her works which are
uniform, her facts which are always certain, with
the fluctuating illu&s;ions of our own imagina|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not here of &s;y&s;tems purely arbitrary, or
of frivolous and imaginary hypothe&s;es, but of the
methods generally employed in the inve&s;tigation
of Nature. Even the method of experiment has
produced more errors than truths. This method,
though the mo&s;t certain, requires great dexteri|ty
of management: A &s;mall deviation either leads
<PB N="179" REF="226">
to barren regions, or to rare and ob&s;cure objects.
We neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;emble them together, and
a&s;cribe to them general relations and common
properties; and, as mankind pa&s;s and repa&s;s on
the crooked paths which have been formed, the
road appears to be clear and beaten. Though
it terminates in nothing, the whole world fol|lows,
the method is adopted, and the con&s;equen|ces
derived from it are received as fixed princi|ples.
I might demon&s;trate this doctrine by ex|po&s;ing
the origin of what are called <HI>principles</HI>
in all the &s;ciences, both ab&s;tract and real: In the
former, the general ba&s;is of the principle is
ab&s;traction, or one or two &s;uppo&s;itions: In
the latter, the principles are only con&s;equen|ces,
good or bad, of the methods which have been
ob&s;erved. I &s;hall here limit my&s;elf to the &s;cience
of anatomy: Did not the fir&s;t man who, contra|ry
to a repugnance of nature, opened a human
body, believe that, by di&s;&s;ecting and examining
its different parts, he would &s;oon di&s;cover its
&s;tructure, mechani&s;m, and functions? But, ha|ving
found the &s;ubject to be infinitely more com|plicated
than he imagined, he was &s;oon obliged
to renounce his preten&s;ions, and to in&s;titute a
method, not for di&s;tingui&s;hing and judging, but
&s;olely in order that he might &s;ee the parts in a
certain train or order. Many ages were nece&s;|&s;ary
to bring this method to any degree of per|fection;
and it alone &s;till occupies the attention
of our mo&s;t accompli&s;hed anatomi&s;ts. This me|thod,
however, is not the &s;cience, but only the
<PB N="180" REF="227">
road which ought to lead to it, and which perhaps
might have led to it, if, in&s;tead of travelling al|ways
in the &s;ame narrow path, anatomi&s;ts had
extended the tract, and compared the human
body with that of the other animals. What
real knowledge can be derived from a &s;ingle
object? Is not every &s;cience founded on the
compari&s;on of &s;imilar and different objects, of
their analogous or oppo&s;ite properties, and of
all their relative qualities? Ab&s;olute know|ledge,
if it has an exi&s;tence, exceeds the powers
of man: We can only judge by the relations
of things. When &s;olely occupied with the method
of inve&s;tigating a &s;ubject, and when we con|&s;ider
it independent of what is analogous or dif|ferent
from it, we can never arrive at real
knowledge, and far le&s;s ri&s;e to any general prin|ciple:
In this ca&s;e, we can only invent names,
and make de&s;criptions of the object, and of all
its parts. Thus, though human bodies have
been di&s;&s;ected for three thou&s;and years, anatomy
is &s;till nothing but &agrave; nomenclature; and hardly
any advances have been made toward the real
object, which is the knowledge of the animal
oeconomy. Be&s;ides, the method it&s;elf is &s;till
imperfect, though it ought to be clear and &s;imple,
&s;ince it depends on in&s;pection, and has no end
but that of denominations? As this nominal
knowledge has been mi&s;taken for &s;cience, ana|tomi&s;ts
have been anxious to augment the num|ber
of names, in&s;tead of limiting the number of
<PB N="181" REF="228">
objects. They have loaded the &s;ubject with mi|nute
and fruitle&s;s details. They were inclined to
di&s;cover di&s;crepances, where every thing was a|like.
In creating new names, they imagined
they were exhibiting new objects; and the de|&s;cription
of a minute part, which had been either
overlooked or neglected by former anatomi&s;ts,
was dignified with the appellation of a <HI>di&s;covery.</HI>
Even the names them&s;elves being frequent|ly
&s;ub&s;tituted in place of the objects, with which
they have no relation, have only &s;erved to aug|ment
the confu&s;ion. Are not the <HI>nates</HI> and <HI>te|&s;tes</HI>
&s;mall parts of the brain &s;imilar to the whole,
and unworthy to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by particular
denominations? The&s;e names, be&s;towed origi|nally
from caprice, at la&s;t gave ri&s;e to new opi|nions
and prejudices. Others, given to parts
which either did not exi&s;t, or were imperfectly
viewed, have been the &s;ources of fre&s;h errors.
How many functions and u&s;es have been a&s;cri|bed
to the pineal gland, and that pretended
void in the brain, called the <HI>fornix,</HI> while the
former is only a &s;imple gland, and the exi&s;tence
of the latter is doubtful, being probably pro|duced
by the hand of the di&s;&s;ector<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Steno.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t difficult part of &s;cience, therefore,
is not to know tho&s;e things which form the di|rect
object of it, but to &s;trip them of a thou|&s;and
fal&s;e colours under which they have been
concealed, to examine the foundation and effects
<PB N="182" REF="229">
of the method employed by former inquirers, to
reject every arbitrary arrangement, and, in fine,
to endeavour to detect every error or prejudice
that has been adopted. All the&s;e precautions
are nece&s;&s;ary to uncover Nature; but, to know
her, we have only to compare her with her&s;elf.
In the animal oeconomy, her appearance is very
my&s;terious, not only becau&s;e the &s;ubject is com|plex,
but becau&s;e, having neglected tho&s;e modes
of compari&s;on, which alone could afford light,
we have been left to wander in the darkne&s;s of
vague hypothe&s;es. The human body has been
de&s;cribed in millions of volumes; while the ana|tomy
of the other animals has been almo&s;t en|tirely
neglected. In the human &s;ubject, we
have di&s;tingui&s;hed, named, and de&s;cribed the
mo&s;t minute parts; while we are ignorant whe|ther
the&s;e, or even parts of greater magnitude
and improtance, exi&s;t in other animals. Particu|lar
functions have been a&s;cribed to particular
organs, without knowing whether the &s;ame
functions are not performed in other beings,
though deprived of the&s;e organs. So that, in the
different explications of the animal oeconomy,
we labour under the double di&s;advantage of ha|ving
commenced with the mo&s;t complicated &s;ub|ject,
and of rea&s;oning concerning this &s;ubject
without the aid of analogy.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this work, we have ob&s;erved
a very different method. Uniformly comparing
Nature with her&s;elf, we have traced her in her
<PB N="183" REF="230">
relations, in her di&s;crepances, and in her ex|tremes.
To mention here only tho&s;e parts rela|tive
to the animal oeconomy, of which we have
had occa&s;ion to treat, as the generation, the &s;en|&s;es,
the movements, the &s;entiment, and the na|ture
of animals, the reader will ea&s;ily perceive,
that, after all the labour be&s;towed in di&s;carding
fal&s;e ideas, in rooting out e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices,
and in &s;eparating truth from arbitrary conceits,
the only art we have employed is that of com|pari&s;on.
If we have &s;ucceeded in throwing
light upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed not
&s;o much to ingenuity or labour, as to the me|thod
we have followed, and which we have en|deavoured
to render as general as our know|ledge
would permit. Before giving general ideas,
we have invariably exhibited the particular re|&s;ults,
or effects.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now content our&s;elves with rela|ting
a few facts, which will be &s;ufficient to prove
that man, in the &s;tate of nature, was never de|&s;tined
to live upon herbs, grain, or fruits; but
that, in every period of his exi&s;tence, he, as well
as mo&s;t other animals, eagerly de&s;ired to nou|ri&s;h
him&s;elf with fle&s;h.</P>
<P>The Pythagorean diet, though extolled by
antient and modern philo&s;ophers, and even re|commended
by certain phy&s;icians, was never
indicated by Nature. In the golden age, man
was innocent as the dove; his food was acorns,
and his beverage pure water from the fountain:
<PB N="184" REF="231">
Finding every where abundant &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he
felt no anxieties, but lived independent, and al|ways
in peace both with him&s;elf and the other
animals. But he no &s;ooner forgot his native
dignity, and &s;acrificed his liberty to the bonds of
&s;ociety, than war and the iron age took place
of that of gold and of peace. Cruelty, and an
in&s;atiable appetite for fle&s;h and blood, were the
fir&s;t fruits of a depraved nature, the corruption
of which was completed by the invention of
manners and of arts.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the reproaches which, in all periods,
have been thrown upon man, in a &s;tate of &s;o|ciety,
by certain au&s;tere and &s;avage philo&s;ophers:
Flattering their private pride, by the humiliation
of the whole &s;pecies, they have exhibited this
unnatural picture, which has no value but in
the contra&s;t: To hold out to man chimerical
ideas of happine&s;s, may, perhaps, be &s;ometimes
u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Did this &s;tate of ideal innocence, of exalted
temperance, of entire ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h, of
perfect tranquillity, of profound peace, ever ex|i&s;t?
Is it not a fable, where man has been em|ployed
as an animal, to give us le&s;&s;ons of moral
in&s;truction? Is it even po&s;&s;ible to conceive the
exi&s;tence of virtue previous to &s;ociety? Does the
lo&s;s of this &s;avage &s;tate merit regret? Was man,
while a wild, un&s;ocial animal, more dignified
than the poli&s;hed citizen? Yes; for every evil
&s;prings from &s;ociety; and what does it import
<PB N="185" REF="232">
whether there was virtue in a &s;tate of nature, if
it gave ri&s;e to happine&s;s, if man were only le&s;s
mi&s;erable than in his pre&s;ent condition? Liberty,
health, &s;trength, are not the&s;e preferable to ef|feminacy,
&s;en&s;uality, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, ac|companied
with &s;lavery? The ab&s;ence of pain is
more e&s;timable than a thou&s;and plea&s;ures: What
is happine&s;s, but to have nothing to de&s;ire?</P>
<P>If this repre&s;entation were ju&s;t, they &s;hould
go farther, and tells us, that it is better to vege|tate
than to live, to have no de&s;ires than to gra|tify
our appetites, to doze perpetually in apathe|tic
&s;lumbers, than to open our eyes to view the
beauties of Nature, and, in a word, to &s;ink below
the condition of brutes, or to become ma&s;&s;es of
inanimate matter attached to the earth, than to
be active and &s;entient beings, capable of recei|ving
plea&s;ure from a thou&s;and &s;ources.</P>
<P>But, in&s;tead of di&s;puting, let us attend to facts:
We &s;ee not the ideal, but the real &s;tate of nature.
Is the &s;avage inhabitant of the de&s;ert a tranquil
being? Is he a happy man? For we mu&s;t not
&s;uppo&s;e, with a certain philo&s;opher, one of the
mo&s;t ferocious cen&s;ors of humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE>, that the
di&s;tance from man, in a pure &s;tate of nature, to
the &s;avage, is greater than from the &s;avage to us;
that the ages elap&s;ed before the invention of
words, have been longer than tho&s;e which were
nece&s;&s;ary for the perfecting of &s;ings and of lan|guage.
I have always thought, that, in rea&s;on|ing
<PB N="186" REF="233">
concerning facts, all &s;uppo&s;itions ought to be
bani&s;hed, till every thing pre&s;ented by Nature be
candidly examined. Now, we find that man|kind
de&s;cend, by imperceptible degrees, from the
mo&s;t enlightened and poli&s;hed nations, to people
of le&s;s genius and indu&s;try; from the latter, to
others more gro&s;s, but &s;till &s;ubject to Kings
and to laws; from the&s;e, again, to &s;avages, who
exhibit as many different &s;hades as the poli&s;hed
nations. Some &s;avages form numerous nations
&s;ubject to chiefs; &s;maller &s;ocieties of them are
governed by cu&s;toms; and the mo&s;t &s;olitary and
independent &s;pecies con&s;titute families, and &s;ub|mit
to their fathers. Thus an empire and a
monarch, a family and a father, are the two ex|tremes
of &s;ociety. The&s;e extremes are likewi&s;e
the boundaries of nature: If they extended far|ther,
in traver&s;ing the numberle&s;s &s;olitudes of
the globe, we mu&s;t have di&s;covered the&s;e human
animals deprived of &s;peech like the monkeys, the
males &s;eparated from the females, their offspring
abandoned to the elements, &amp;c. Even &s;uppo|&s;ing
the con&s;titution of the human body to be
very different from what we &s;ee it, and that its
growth were more rapid, it is impo&s;&s;ible to main|tain
that man ever exi&s;ted without forming fa|milies;
becau&s;e, if not cheri&s;hed and attended
for &s;everal years, the whole children mu&s;t have
inevitably peri&s;hed. Whereas, other animals re|quire
the care of the mother only a few months.
This phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity is a perfect demon&s;tra|tion,
<PB N="187" REF="234">
that the human &s;pecies could neither mul|tiply
nor exi&s;t independent of &s;ociety; and that
the attachement of parents to children is natural.
This attachment mu&s;t unite the parents and chil|dren
into a &s;mall &s;ociety, which alone would be
&s;ufficient to accu&s;tom them to make certain ge|&s;tures,
to utter certain &s;ounds, and inure them to
every expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment and of de&s;ire. All
this is atte&s;ted by facts; for the mo&s;t &s;olitary &s;a|vages
have, like other men, the u&s;e of &s;igns and
of words.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;tate of pure nature is a known &s;tate:
It is that of the &s;avage living in the de&s;ert, but
living in family, knowing his children, and be|ing
known by them, u&s;ing words, and making
him&s;elf under&s;tood. The &s;avage girl picked up
in the woods of Champagne, and the man found
in the fore&s;ts of Hanover, are not exceptions to
this doctrine. They had lived in ab&s;olute &s;oli|tude;
and could not, therefore, have any idea
of &s;ociety, or of the u&s;e of words: But, if they
had ever met, the propen&s;ity of nature would
have con&s;trained, and plea&s;ure united them. At|tached
to each other, they would &s;oon have made
them&s;elves under&s;tood; they would have fir&s;t
learned the language of love, and then that of
tenderne&s;s for their offspring. Be&s;ides, the&s;e &s;a|vages
&s;prung from men of &s;ociety, and mu&s;t have
been left in the woods at the age of four or five
years; for, before this period, they could not
have exi&s;ted. They mu&s;t have been old enough
<PB N="188" REF="235">
to be able to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but not to re|tain
the ideas which had been communicated to
them.</P>
<P>Let us, then, examine this man of nature, this
&s;avage living in the family &s;tate. If the family
pro&s;pers, he will &s;oon become the chief of a nu|merous
&s;ociety, of which all the members will
have the &s;ame manners, ob&s;erve the &s;ame cu|&s;toms,
and &s;peak the &s;ame language. At the
third or fourth generation, new families will
ari&s;e, who may live &s;eparately; but, being uni|ted
by the common bonds of cu&s;toms and lan|guage,
they will form a &s;mall nation, which, in|crea&s;ing
with time, may, according to circum|&s;tances,
either become one people, or remain in
a &s;tate &s;imilar to that of tho&s;e &s;avage nations
with which we are acquainted. If the&s;e new
men live under a mild climate, and upon a fer|tile
&s;oil, they may occupy, in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of liberty, a con&s;iderable &s;pace, beyond which,
if they meet with nothing but de&s;erts, or men
equally new with them&s;elves, they will remain
&s;avage, and become, according to circum&s;tances,
either friends or enemies to their neighbours.
But, when under a &s;evere climate, or ungrateful
&s;oil, they find them&s;elves pinched by numbers,
or cramped for want of room, they will make
irruptions, form colonies, and blend them&s;elves
with other nations, of which they will either be|come
the conquerors or the &s;laves. Thus man,
in every &s;ituation, and under every climate, tends
<PB N="189" REF="236">
equally toward &s;ociety. It is the uniform effect
of a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e; for, without this natural
tendency, the propagation of the &s;p&egrave;cies, and, of
cour&s;e, the exi&s;tence of mankind, would &s;oon
cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the origin of &s;ociety, and
&s;hown that it is founded on nature, let us next
inquire what are the appetites and ta&s;te of &s;a|vages.
In this inve&s;tigation, we &s;hall find, that
none of them live &s;olely on fruits, herbs, or
grain; that they all prefer fle&s;h and fi&s;h to other
aliments; that pure water is not plea&s;ant to
them; and that they endeavour either to make
for them&s;elves, or to procure from others, a le&s;s
in&s;ipid beverage. The &s;avages of the South
drink the water of the date-tree; tho&s;e of the
North &s;wallow large draughts of whale oil; o|thers
make fermented liquors; and the whole,
without exception, di&s;cover a violent pa&s;&s;ion for
ardent &s;pirits. Their indu&s;try, dictated by ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and excited by their natural appetites, is
confined to the making of in&s;truments for hunt|ing
and fi&s;hing. A bow and arrows, a club, a
net, and a canoe, con&s;titute the whole of their
arts, and are all de&s;tined to procure a &s;pecies of
food corre&s;ponding to their ta&s;te: And, what
corre&s;ponds with their ta&s;te, mu&s;t be agreeable to
nature; for, as formerly remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. 3. article Bull.</NOTE>, man would
die of inanition, if he took not more &s;ub&s;tantial
food than herbs alone. Having but one &s;to|mach
<PB N="190" REF="237">
mach and &s;hort inte&s;tines, he could not take a
&s;ufficient quantity of &s;uch meagre food as would
afford him proper nouri&s;hment. The &s;ame
remark is applicable to fruits and grain; for,
though corns and other grains have been high|ly
improved by culture, and contain a greater
quantity of organic nutritive particles, than any
of tho&s;e which are produced &s;pontaneou&s;ly by
nature; yet, if men were denied any other food,
he would only drag out a feeble and a langui&s;h|ing
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>View tho&s;e &s;olitary enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who ab|&s;tain
from every thing that has had life, who,
from motives of &s;anctity, renounce the gifts of
the Creator, fly from &s;ociety, and &s;hut them&s;elves
up within &s;acred walls, again&s;t which Nature
continually revolts: Confined in tho&s;e living
tombs, where they contemplate nothing but
death, their mortified vi&s;ages and hollow eyes
indicate perpetual efforts to &s;upport a lan|gui&s;hing,
feeble, and u&s;ele&s;s exi&s;tence. They
take food; but their hunger never abates.
Though aided by the fervour of a romantic i|magination,
they are enabled to re&s;i&s;t the effects
of this cruel ab&s;tinence for a few years only,
and may be &s;aid rather to die daily than to live.</P>
<P>If man were obliged to ab&s;tain totally from
fle&s;h, he could not, at lea&s;t in our climates, ei|ther
exi&s;t or multiply. This diet may, perhaps,
be practicable in &s;outhern countries, where the
fruits are better concocted, and the plants, roots,
<PB N="191" REF="238">
and grains more nouri&s;hing. The Brahmans,
however, rather form a &s;ect, than a people; and
their religion, though very antient, has never
extended beyond their own climate.</P>
<P>This religion, founded on metaphy&s;ics, is a
&s;triking example of the lot of human opinions.
By collecting the &s;cattered fragments which re|main,
it is unque&s;tionable that the &s;ciences have
been very antiently cultivated, and perhaps ri|pened
to a degree of perfection beyond what
they now are. It has been known, long before
the pre&s;ent aera, that all animated beings con|tained
inde&s;tructible living particles, which pa&s;|&s;ed
from one body into another. This truth,
adopted at fir&s;t by philo&s;ophers, and afterwards
more generally diffu&s;ed, would only pre&s;erve its
purity during the enlightened ages. A revolu|tion
of dark periods having &s;ucceeded, no more
of the living organic particles were remembered
than what was &s;ufficient to give ri&s;e to the no|tion,
that the living principle of animals con&s;ti|tuted
an inde&s;tructible whole, which &s;eparated
from the body after death. To this ideal whole
they gave the name of <HI>Soul,</HI> which they &s;oon re|garded
as a being really exi&s;ting in all animals;
and, combinging with this chimerical being, the
real, but disfigured, idea of the pa&s;&s;age of living
particles, they maintained, that, after death, this
&s;oul tran&s;migrated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and perpetually
from one body to another. From this &s;y&s;tem
man was not excepted: They quickly a&s;&s;ociated
<PB N="192" REF="239">
morality with metaphy&s;ics: They he&s;itated not
to hold, that this &s;urviving being retained, in all
its tran&s;migrations, its former &s;entiments, affec|tions,
and de&s;ires. Weak minds trembled. They
contemplated with horror the pa&s;&s;age of the &s;oul
from an agreeable lodging to be an inhabitant
of an unclean and lothe&s;ome animal. Every
new fear engenders a fre&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. In kill|ing
an naimal, they were terrified le&s;t they
&s;hould murder their mi&s;tre&s;s or their father.
They regarded every brute as their neighbour:
And, at la&s;t, both from motives of tenderne&s;s
and of duty, they maintained that they ought
to ab&s;tain from every thing endowed with life.
This is the origin and progre&s;s of the mo&s;t an|tient
religion of India: An origin which &s;hows,
that truth, when committed to the multitude, is
&s;oon disfigured; that a philo&s;ophical opinion
never becomes popular till it has changed its
form; but that, by means of this preparation, it
may prove the ba&s;is of a religion, the &s;tability of
which will be proportioned to the univer&s;ality
of the prejudice, and, being founded on truths
mi&s;under&s;tood, it mu&s;t be environed with ob&s;cu|rity,
and, of cour&s;e, it will have an air of my|&s;tery,
of grandeur, and of incomprehen&s;ibi|lity:
In fine, that fear, combining with reve|rence,
will make this religion degenerate into
&s;uper&s;titious and ridiculous practices, which,
however, will take root, and produce rites that
at fir&s;t will be &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved, but will &s;o
<PB N="193" REF="240">
gradually alter with time, that even the opinion
which gave them birth, can only be traced in
fal&s;e traditions, in proverbs, and in tales puerile
and ab&s;urd. From hence we may conclude, that
every religion founded on human opinions is
fal&s;e and variable; and that, to promulgate the
true religion, which depends not on the fancies
of men, and which is con&s;tant, unalterable, and
will always be the &s;ame, is the prerogative of
God alone.</P>
<P>But, to return to our &s;ubject. An entire ab|&s;tinence
from fle&s;h can have no effect but to en|feeble
nature. Man, to pre&s;erve him&s;elf in pro|per
plight, requires not only the u&s;e of this &s;olid
nouri&s;hment, but even to vary it. To obtain
complete vigour, he mu&s;t choo&s;e that &s;pecies of
food which is mo&s;t agreeable to his con&s;titution;
and, as he cannot pre&s;erve him&s;elf in a &s;tate of
activity, but by procuring new &s;en&s;ations, he
mu&s;t give his &s;en&s;es their full &s;tretch, and eat a
variety of meats, to prevent the di&s;gu&s;t ari&s;ing
from an uniformity of nouri&s;hment. But he
mu&s;t avoid every exce&s;s, which is &s;till more noxi|ous
than ab&s;tinence.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e animals who have but one &s;tomach, and
&s;hort inte&s;tines, are obliged, like man, to feed
upon fle&s;h. It is an unque&s;tionable fact, that all
animals which have more &s;tomachs than one, and
long inte&s;tines, like the cow, &s;heep, goat, &amp;c.
are herbivorous, and that tho&s;e who have but
<PB N="194" REF="241">
one &s;tomach and &s;hort inte&s;tines, like men, dogs,
wolves, lions, &amp;c. are carnivorous.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not, however, be concluded, that her|bivorous
animals are under a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity
of feeding on herbs alone, though the carnivo|rous
tribes can by no means &s;ub&s;i&s;t without fle&s;h.
We only maintain, that the former can be &s;uffi|ciently
nouri&s;hed without the u&s;e of fle&s;h; not
that they would not have recour&s;e to this food,
if Nature had endowed them with talents a|dapted
to the purpo&s;es of &s;eizing prey; for we
have &s;een &s;heep, calves, goats, and hor&s;es, eat,
with avidity, milk, eggs, and even fle&s;h, when
cut down and &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt, though they
had not been previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to &s;uch food.
We may, therefore, maintain, that the ta&s;te for fle&s;h
is an appetite common to all animals, and that it
is exerted with more or le&s;s vehemence or mo|deration
according to their particular conforma|tion;
for this appetite is apparent not only in
man and the quadrupeds, but in birds, fi&s;hes, in|&s;ects,
and worms; to the la&s;t of which, it would
appear, all fle&s;h has been ultimately de&s;tined by
Nature.</P>
<P>Nutrition, in every animal, is performed by
organic particles, which, after being &s;eparated
from the gro&s;s ma&s;s of aliment, by means of
dige&s;tion, mingle with the blood, and are a&s;&s;i|milated
to all the parts of the body: But,
independent of this principal effect, which is
always proportioned to the quality of food, an|other
effect is produced, which depends on the
<PB N="195" REF="242">
quantity or bulk of the nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances.
The &s;tomach and inte&s;tines con&s;i&s;t of flexible
membranes, which occupy a con&s;iderable &s;pace
within the body. The&s;e membranes, to pre&s;erve
them in a proper &s;tate of ten&s;ion, and to counter|balance
the action of the neighbouring organs,
require to be always partly filled. If, for want
of nouri&s;hment, this large &s;pace be left entirely
void, the membranes, having no internal &s;up|port,
collap&s;e, and adhere to each other, which
gives ri&s;e to weakne&s;s, and all the &s;ymptoms of
extreme want. Thus the aliments, before an|&s;wering
the purpo&s;es of nutrition, &s;erve as a bal|la&s;t
to the body. Both their pre&s;ence and their
volume are nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the equilibrium
between the internal parts, which act and re|act
again&s;t each other. When a man dies of
hunger, it is not &s;o much for want of nouri&s;h|ment,
as of a proper poi&s;e to the body. Thus
animals, and e&s;pecially the mo&s;t voracious tribes,
when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, are &s;o eager to fill
the internal void, that they &s;wallow earth and
&s;tones. Clay has been found in the &s;tomach of
a wolf; and I have &s;een &s;wine eat it greedily.
Mo&s;t birds &s;wallow pebbles, &amp;c. This is not the
effect of ta&s;te, but of nece&s;&s;ity; for the mo&s;t
craving want is, not to refre&s;h the blood with
new chyle, but to maintain an equilibrium in the
action of the great parts of the animal machine.</P>

<P>THE wolf is one of tho&s;e animals who&s;e
carnivorous appetite is &s;tronge&s;t. Though
he has received from Nature the means of gra|tifiying
this ta&s;te, though &s;he has be&s;towed on
him arms, craftine&s;s, &s;trength, agility, and every
thing nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;covering, &s;eizing, conquer|ing,
and devouring his prey; yet he often dies
of hunger; becau&s;e men have declared war a|gain&s;t
him, put a price on his head, and forced
him to fly to the fore&s;ts, where he finds only a
few &s;pecies of wild animals, who e&s;cape from
him by the &s;wiftne&s;s of their cour&s;e, and whom
he cannot &s;urpri&s;e but by chance, or by a patient,
<PB N="197" REF="244">
and often fruitle&s;s attendance at tho&s;e places to
which they generally re&s;ort. He is naturally
clowni&s;h and da&s;tardly; but want makes him
ingenious, and nece&s;&s;ity gives him courage.
When pre&s;&s;ed with famine, he braves danger;
he attacks tho&s;e animals which are under the pro|tection
of man, e&s;pecially &s;uch as he can tran&s;|port
with ea&s;e, as lambs, &s;mall dogs, and kids;
and, when &s;ucce&s;sful in his bloody expeditions,
he returns often to the charge, till, being wound|ed,
chaced, and maletreated by men and dogs, he
retires, during the day, to his den; but i&s;&s;ues
forth in the night, traver&s;es the country, roams
about the cottages, kills all the animals which have
been left without, digs the earth under the doors,
enters with a dreadful ferocity, and puts every
living creature to death before he choo&s;es to
depart, and carry off his prey. When the&s;e in-roads
happen to be fruitle&s;s, he returns to the
woods, &s;earches about with avidity, follows the
tract of wild bea&s;ts, and pur&s;ues them, in the hope
that they may be &s;topped and &s;eized by &s;ome o|ther
wolf, and that he may be a partaker of the
&s;poil. In fine, when his hunger is extreme, he
lo&s;es the idea of fear; he attacks women and
children, and even &s;ometimes darts upon men,
till, becoming perfectly furious by exce&s;&s;ive ex|ertions,
he generally falls a &s;acrifice to pure rage
and di&s;traction.</P>
<P>The wolf, both externally and internally, has
&s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the dog, that he &s;eems
<PB N="198" REF="245">
to have been formed upon the &s;ame model. But
he exhibits the &s;ame characters under a ma&s;k.
The figure is &s;imilar; but the re&s;ult is directly
rever&s;ed. Their natural di&s;po&s;itions are &s;o op|po&s;ite,
that they are not only incompatible, but
repugnant by nature, and inimical by in&s;tinct.
A young dog trembles at the fir&s;t glance of a
wolf. The odour of the wolf, though new and
unknown, excites &s;uch an aver&s;ion in the dog,
that he flies, and comes quivering to the feet of
his ma&s;ter. A ma&s;tiff, who knows his own
&s;trength, though terrified at the appearance of a
wolf, attacks him with courage, endeavours to
put him to flight, and exerts every effort to get
rid of an odious object. They never meet, but
either flight or death is the con&s;equence. When
the wolf is &s;tronge&s;t, he mangles and devours
his prey. The dog, with more genero&s;ity, con|tents
him&s;elf with victory; he finds no &s;avory
odour in the body of a dead enemy; but aban|dons
him to be food for the ravens, and even to
other wolves; for wolves eat the carca&s;&s;es of
each other, and, when one is much wounded,
the others follow the blood, and a&s;&s;emble in troops
to de&s;patch him.</P>
<P>The dog, even when wild, is not a fierce ani|mal.
He is ea&s;ily tamed, and attaches him&s;elf
with fidelity to his ma&s;ter. The young wolf
may al&s;o be tamed; but he feels no attachments;
Nature in him is too powerful for education:
With age, he re&s;umes his ferocious character, and
<PB N="199" REF="246">
returns, with the fir&s;t opportunity, to his &s;avage
&s;tate. Dogs, even tho&s;e of the mo&s;t clowni&s;h
race, love to a&s;&s;ociate with other animals, and
are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to accompany them: It is
by in&s;tinct alone, and not by education, that
they know how to conduct and guard the flocks.
The wolf, on the contrary, is an enemy to all
&s;ociety, and keeps no company even with tho&s;e
of his own &s;pecies. When &s;everal wolves ap|pear
together, it is not a &s;ociety of peace, but of
war; it is attended with tumult and dreadful
prowlings, and indicates an attack upon &s;ome
large animal, as a &s;tag, an ox, or a formi|dable
ma&s;tiff. This military expedition is no
&s;ooner fini&s;hed, than they &s;eparate, and each re|turns
in &s;ilence to his &s;olitude. There is even
little intercour&s;e between the males and females:
They feel the mutual attractions of love but once
a-year, and never remain long together. The
females come in &s;ea&s;on in winter: Many males
follow the &s;ame female; and this a&s;&s;ociation is
more bloody than the former; for they growl,
chaff, fight, and tear one another, and often &s;a|crifice
him that is preferred by the female. The
female commonly flies a long time, fatigues her
admirers, and retires, while they &s;leep, with the
mo&s;t alert or mo&s;t favourite male.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of love continues only twelve or
fifteen days; it commences with the olde&s;t fe|males;
the young ones are not &s;o early di&s;po&s;ed.
The males have no marked period, but are e|qually
<PB N="200" REF="247">
ready at all times. They go from female
to female, according as they are in a condition to
receive them: They begin with the old females
about the end of December, and fini&s;h with the
young ones in the month of February or begin|ning
of March. The time of ge&s;tation is about
three months and a half<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Nouveau trait&eacute; de venerie, p. 75.</NOTE>; and young whelps
are found from the end of April to the month
of July. This difference in the time of ge&s;ta|tion
between the &s;he-wolf, who carries 100 days,
and the bitch, who carries only 60 days, proves
that the wolf and dog differ as much in their
con&s;titutions, and particularly in one of the chief
functions of the animal oeconomy, as they do
in their tempers. Thus, the wolf and dog have
never been regarded as the &s;ame animal but by
the nomenclators of natural hi&s;tory, who, being
acquainted with the &s;urface of nature only, ne|ver
extend their views beyond their own me|thods,
which are always deceitful, and often er|roneous,
even in the mo&s;t obvious facts. The
dog and wolf cannot copulate, or produce an
intermediate race<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See article Dog.</NOTE>. Their di&s;po&s;itions are op|po&s;ite,
and their con&s;titutions different. The
wolf lives much longer than the dog; the for|mer
brings forth but once a-year, and the latter
twice or thrice. The&s;e di&s;tinctions are more
than &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate the two animals
to be of very different kinds. Be&s;ides, upon a
<PB N="201" REF="248">
clo&s;er examination, we ea&s;ily perceive, that, even
externally, the wolf differs from the dog by e&s;|&s;ential
and uniform characters. The appearance
of the head and form of the bones are by no
means the &s;ame. The cavity of the eye in the
wolf is placed obliquely; the orbits are inclined;
the eyes &s;parkle, and &s;hine in the dark; in&s;tead
of barking, he howls; his movements, though
quick and precipitate, are more equal and uni|form;
his body is &s;tronger, but not &s;o flexible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle tells us, that the neck of the wolf con&s;i&s;ts of one continued bone. But this is a mi&s;take; for the wolf's neck is compo&s;ed of vertebrac, and is equally flexible as that of a dog.</NOTE>;
his members are firmer, his jaws and teeth lar|ger,
and his hair coar&s;er and thicker.</P>
<P>But the&s;e animals have a great re&s;emblance in
their internal &s;tructure. The wolves copulate
like the dogs, and have an o&s;&s;eous penis, &s;ur|rounded
with a ring, which &s;wells and hinders
them from &s;eparating. When the females are
about to bring forth, they &s;earch for a concealed
place in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t. After
fixing on the &s;pot, they make it &s;mooth and plain
for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, by cutting and tearing up
with their teeth all the brambles and bru&s;h-wood.
They then bring great quantities of mo&s;s, and
prepare a commodious bed for their young,
which are generally five or &s;ix, though &s;ome|times
they bring forth &s;even, eight, and even
nine, but never le&s;s than three. They come in|to
the world blind, like the dogs; the mother
<PB N="202" REF="249">
&s;uckles them &s;ome weeks, and &s;oon learns them
to eat fle&s;h, which &s;he prepares for them by
tearing it into &s;mall pieces. Some time after,
&s;he brings them field-mice, young hares, par|tridges,
and living fowls. The young wolves begin
by playing with the&s;e animals, and at la&s;t worry
them; then the mother pulls off the feathers,
tears them in pieces, and gives a part to each of
her young. They never leave their den till the
end of &s;ix weeks or two months. They then
follow their mother, who leads them to drink in
the hollow trunk of a tree, or in &s;ome neigh|bouring
pool. She conducts them back to the
den, or, when any danger is apprehended, ob|liges
them to conceal them&s;elves el&s;ewhere.
Though, like other females, the &s;he-wolf is na|turally
more timid than the male; yet, when
her young are attacked, &s;he defends them with
intrepedity; &s;he lo&s;es all &s;en&s;e of danger, and
becomes perfectly furious. She never leaves them
till their education is fini&s;hed, till they are &s;o
&s;trong as to need no a&s;&s;i&s;tance or protection, and
have acquired talents fit for rapine, which gene|rally
happens in ten or twelve months after their
fir&s;t teeth, which commonly fall out in the &s;ixth
month<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la Veneri&eacute; de du Fouilloux, p. 100.</NOTE>, are replaced.</P>
<P>Both males and females are capable of gene|rating
at the age of two years. The females, it
is probable, like tho&s;e of other &s;pecies, are &s;ooner
mature for this operation than the males. It is
<PB N="203" REF="250">
certain, however, that they never come in &s;ea&s;on
before the &s;econd winter after birth, which im|plies
18 or 20 months. A &s;he-wolf, which I
brought up, di&s;covered no marks of love till the
third winter, or more than two years and a half.
We are a&s;&s;ured by the hunters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le Nouveau trait&eacute; de la Veneri&eacute;, p. 276.</NOTE>, that, in every
litter, there are more males than females; which
confirms the general remark, that, in every &s;pe|cies,
the number of males exceeds that of the
females. They likewi&s;e tell us, that &s;ome males
attach them&s;elves to the females, after the &s;ea&s;on
of love is over, and accompany them till they
are about to bring forth; that then the female
&s;teals off, and anxiou&s;ly conceals her young, le&s;t
the father &s;hould devour them immediately af|ter
birth; but that, when brought forth,
he takes an affection for them, &s;upplies them
with food, and, if deprived of their mother,
provides for and protects them him&s;elf. The&s;e
facts, however, have the air of fiction, and &s;eem
contrary to the natural di&s;po&s;itions of the wolf.</P>
<P>Wolves acquire their full growth at the end
of two or three years, and live 15 or 20 years.
This fact accords with what we have already
remarked concerning many other &s;pecies, that
the time of growth is the &s;eventh part of the
total duration of life. When old, wolves turn
whiti&s;h, and their teeth are much worn. When
full, or fatigued, they &s;leep, but more during the
day than the night, and it is always a kind of
<PB N="204" REF="251">
&s;light &s;lumber. They drink often; and, in the
time of drought, when there is no water in the
hollows, or in the trunks of old trees, they re|pair,
&s;everal times in a day, to the brooks or ri|vulets.
Though extremely voracious, if &s;up|plied
with water, they can pa&s;s four or five days
without meat.</P>
<P>The wolf has great &s;trength, e&s;pecially in the
anterior parts of the body, in the mu&s;cles of the
neck and jaws. He carries a &s;heep in his mouth,
and, at the &s;ame time, outruns the &s;hepherds;
&s;o that he can only be &s;topped or deprived of his
prey by dogs. His bite is cruel, and always
more ob&s;tinate in proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of
the re&s;i&s;tance; for, when an animal can defend
it&s;elf, he is cautious and circum&s;pect. He never
fights, but from nece&s;&s;ity, and not from motives
of courage. When wounded with a ball, he
cries; and yet, when de&s;patching him with blud|geons,
he complains not. He is harder, le&s;s
&s;en&s;ible, and more robu&s;t than the dog. He
runs and roams about whole days and nights;
and, of all animals, he is perhaps the mo&s;t diffi|cult
to conquer in the chace. The dog is gentle
and courageous; the wolf, though ferocious, is
timid. When he falls into a &s;nare, he is &s;o o|vercome
with terror, that he may be either kill|ed
or taken alive, without re&s;i&s;tance. He allows
him&s;elf to be chained, muzzled, and led where
you plea&s;e, without exhibiting the lea&s;t &s;ymptom
of re&s;entment or di&s;content. The &s;en&s;es of the
<PB N="205" REF="252">
wolf are excellent, but particularly his &s;en&s;e of
&s;melling, which often extends farther than his
eye. The odour of carrion &s;trikes him at the
di&s;tance of more than a league. He likewi&s;e
&s;cents live animals very far, and hunts them
a long time by following their track. When
he i&s;&s;ues from the wood, he never lo&s;es the
wind. He &s;tops upon the borders of the fore&s;t,
&s;mells on all &s;ides, and receives the emanations
of living or dead animals brought to him from a
di&s;tance by the wind. Though he prefers living
to dead animals; yet he devours the mo&s;t pu|trid
carca&s;&s;es. He is fond of human fle&s;h, and,
if &s;tronger, he would, perhaps, eat no other.
Wolves have been known to follow armies, to
come in troops to the field of battle, where bo|dies
are carele&s;sly interred, to tear them up, and
to devour them with an infatiable avidity: And,
when once accu&s;tomed to human fle&s;h, the&s;e
wolves ever after attack men, prefer the &s;hep|herd
to the flock, devour women, and carry off
children. Wolves of this vitious di&s;po&s;ition are
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Loups garoux</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la cha&s;&s;e du loup de Ga&s;ton Phoebus.</NOTE>, or
wolves that &s;hould be guarded again&s;t.</P>
<P>Whole countries are &s;ometimes obliged to arm,
in order to de&s;troy the wolves. Princes have
particular equipages for this &s;pecies of hunting,
which is both u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary. Hunters di|&s;tingui&s;h
wolves into <HI>young, old,</HI> and <HI>very old.</HI>
They know them by the tracks of their feet.
<PB N="206" REF="253">
The older the wolf, his feet is the larger. The
&s;he-wolf's feet are longer and more &s;lender; her
heel is al&s;o &s;maller, and her toes thinner. A
good blood-hound is nece&s;&s;ary for hunting the
wolf; and, when he falls into the &s;cent, he mu&s;t
be coaxed and encouraged; for all dogs have an
aver&s;ion from the wolf, and proceed with cold|ne&s;s
in the chace. When the wolf is rai&s;ed, the
grey-hounds are let loo&s;e in pairs, and one is
kept for di&s;lodging him, if he gets under cover;
the other dogs are led before as a re&s;erve. The
fir&s;t pair are let after the wolf, and are &s;upport|ed
by a man on hor&s;e-back; then the &s;econd
pair are let loo&s;e at the di&s;tance of &s;even or eight
hundred paces; and, la&s;tly, the third pair, when
the other dogs begin to join and to teaze the wolf.
The whole together &s;oon reduce him to the la&s;t
extremity; and the hunters complete the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
by &s;tabbing him with a dagger. The dogs
have &s;uch a reluctance to the wolf's fle&s;h, that
it mu&s;t be prepared and &s;ea&s;oned, before they will
eat it. The wolf may al&s;o be hunted with
beagles or hounds; but, as he darts always
&s;traight forward, and runs for a whole day with|out
&s;lopping, the chace is irk&s;ome, unle&s;s the
beagles be &s;upported by grey-hounds, to teaze
him, and give the hounds time to come up.</P>
<P>In the country, though men, attended with
ma&s;tiffs, beat the bu&s;hes, lay &s;nares and baits, dig
pits, and &s;catter poi&s;oned pieces of meat; yet
the number of the&s;e de&s;tructive animals never
<PB N="207" REF="254">
decrea&s;es, e&s;pecially in woody countries. The
Briti&s;h pretend to have cleared their i&s;land of
this rapacious creature; and yet I am a&s;&s;ured
that wolves &s;till exi&s;t in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;upplement to this article.</NOTE>. As there is
little wood in the &s;outhern parts of Britain, it
was a more ea&s;y ta&s;k to extirpate the wolf.</P>
<P>The hair and colour of the&s;e animals vary
with the climate, and &s;ometimes even in the &s;ame
country. In France and Germany, be&s;ide the
common wolves, we find &s;ome with thicker and
more yellow coloured hair. The&s;e wolves, more
wild, though le&s;s de&s;tructive, than the other kind,
never trouble the flocks or the habitations of
men, and live &s;olely on hunting. In the nor|thern
countries, we meet with &s;ome wolves which
are entirely white, and others entirely black;
and the latter are larger and &s;tronger than the
former. The common &s;pecies are very generally
diffu&s;ed: They are found in A&s;ia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Le Voyage de Pietro della Valle, vol. 4. p. 4.</NOTE>, Africa<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Prev&ocirc;t, tom. 5. p. 85.</NOTE>, and
America<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Le Voyage du Leclercq. p. 488.</NOTE>, as well as in Europe. The wolves
of Senegal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, tom. 3. p. 285. Voage de le Maire aux i&s;les Canaries, Cap Verd, &amp;c. p. 100.</NOTE> re&s;emble tho&s;e of France, only they
are larger and more rapacious. The wolves of
Egypt<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. animal. lib. 8. cap. 28.</NOTE> are &s;maller than tho&s;e of Greece. In
the Ea&s;t, and particularly in Per&s;ia, wolves are ex|hibited
as &s;pectacles to the people. When young,
<PB N="208" REF="255">
they are learned to dance, or rather to perform
a kind of wre&s;tling with a number of men.
Chardin tell us, that a wolf, well educated in
dancing, is &s;old at 500 French crowns. This
fact proves, that the&s;e animals, by time and re|&s;traint,
are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome kind of educa|tion.
I have brought up &s;everal of them: When
young, or during their fir&s;t year, they are very
docile, and even care&s;&s;ing; and, if well fed, they
neither di&s;turb the poultry, nor any other ani|mal.
But, at the age of 18 months or two years,
their natural ferocity returns, and they mu&s;t be
chained, to prevent them from running off, and
doing mi&s;chief. I brought up one till the age
of 18 or 19 months, in a court along with fowls,
none of which he ever attacked; but, for his fir&s;t
e&s;&s;ay, he killed the whole in one night, without
eating any of them. Another, having broken
his chain, run off, after killing a dog with whom
he had lived in great familiarity. I kept a
&s;he-wolf three years in a large court; and,
though &s;hut up, when very young, along with a
ma&s;tiff dog of the &s;ame age, &s;he could never &s;uf|fer
him to approach, even when &s;he came in &s;ea|&s;on.
She provoked, &s;he attacked, &s;he bit the
dog, who at fir&s;t only defended him&s;elf, but at
la&s;t he worried her.</P>
<P>There is nothing valuable in the wolf but his
&s;kin, which makes a warm, durable fur. His
fle&s;h is &s;o bad, that it is rejected with abhorrence
by all other quadrupeds; and no animal but a
<PB N="209" REF="256">
wolf will voluntarily eat a wolf. The &s;mell of
his breath is exceedingly offen&s;ive. As, to ap|pea&s;e
hunger, he &s;wallows indi&s;criminately every
thing he can find, corrupted fle&s;h, bones, hair,
&s;kins half tanned and covered with lime, he vo|mits
frequently, and empties him&s;elf oftener
than he fills. In fine, the wolf is con&s;ummate|ly
di&s;agreeable; his a&s;pect is ba&s;e and &s;avage,
his voice dreadful, his odour in&s;upportable, his
di&s;po&s;ition perver&s;e, his manners ferocious; o|dious
and de&s;tructive when living, and, when
dead, he is perfectly u&s;ele&s;s.</P>

<P>In the hi&s;tory of the wolf, I remarked, that
this animal was entirely extirpated in England.
By way of recompen&s;e, it would appear, that
the&s;e voracious creatures have found out new
countries to inhabit. Pontoppidan alledges, that
they exi&s;ted not in Norway before the year 1718.

were &s;omewhat larger, more erect, and at a great|er
di&s;tance from each other. The eyes were
likewi&s;e a little &s;maller, and appeared to be more
di&s;tant from one another, than in the common
wolf. The&s;e differences, in my opinion, are
too incon&s;iderable to con&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.
The greate&s;t difference is that of the &s;ize. But,
as I have oftener than once remarked, all the
animals common to the northern parts of Eu|rope
and America differ in &s;ize; and the black
wolf of Canada being &s;maller than tho&s;e of Eu|rope,
only tends to confirm the general fact.
Be&s;ides, as he had been taken when very young,
and ever afterwards confined with a chain, con|&s;traint
alone was perhaps &s;ufficient to prevent

<P>THE fox is famous for craftine&s;s; and he
merits, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the reputation
he has acquired. What the wolf executes by
force alone, the fox performs by addre&s;s, and
often with more &s;ucce&s;s. Without combating
dogs or &s;hepherds, without attacking the flocks,
or di&s;interring the bodies of the dead, the fox
is more certain of procuring his food. He ex|erts
more genius than motion, and all his re|&s;ources
are within him&s;elf. Acute as well as
circum&s;pect, ingenious, and patiently prudent,
he diver&s;ifies his conduct, and always re&s;erves
&s;ome art for unfore&s;een accidents. Of his own
pre&s;ervation he is extremely vigilant. Though
equally indefatigable, and even nimbler than the
<PB N="215" REF="264">
wolf, he tru&s;ts not entirely to the &s;wiftne&s;s of
his cour&s;e. The fox knows how to en&s;ure &s;afe|ty,
by providing him&s;elf with an a&s;ylum, where
he retires from pre&s;&s;ing dangers, where he dwells,
and where he brings up his young. He is not
a vagabond, but lives in a &s;ettled dome&s;tic &s;tate.</P>
<P>This difference, though it appears even among
men, has greater effects, and &s;uppo&s;es more power|ful
cau&s;es, among the inferior animals. The
&s;ingle idea of a hou&s;e, or &s;ettled place of abode, in|dicates
a &s;ingular attention to &s;elf. The choice
of &s;ituation, the art of making and rendering a
hou&s;e commodious, and of concealing the ave|nues
to it, imply a &s;uperior degree of &s;entiment.
The fox is endowed with this quality, and ma|nages
it with advantage. He fixes his abode on
the border of the wood, in the neighbourhood
of cottages: He li&s;tens to the crowing of the
cocks and the cries of the poultry. He &s;cents
them at a di&s;tance; he choo&s;es his time with
judgment; he conceals his road as well as his
de&s;ign; he &s;lips forward with caution, &s;ome|times
even trailing his body, and &s;eldom makes
a fruitle&s;s expedition. If he can leap the wall,
or get in underneath, he ravages the court-yard,
puts all to death, and then retires &s;oftly with his
prey, which he either hides under the herbage,
or carries off to his kennel. He returns in a
few minutes for another, which he carries off,
or conceals in the &s;ame manner, but in a differ|ent
place. In this way he proceeds till the pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="265">
of the &s;un, or &s;ome movements perceived
in the hou&s;e, adverti&s;e him that it is time to &s;u|&s;pend
his operations, and to retire to his den.
He plays the &s;ame game with the catchers of
thru&s;hes, wood-cocks, &amp;c. He vi&s;its the nets
and bird-lime, very early in the morning, car|ries
off &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the birds which are entangled,
and lays them in different places, e&s;pecially near
the &s;ides of high-ways, in the furrows, under
the herbage or bru&s;hwood, where they &s;ome|times
lie two or three days; but he knows per|fectly
where to find them, when he is in need.
He hunts the young hares in the plains, &s;eizes
old ones in their &s;eats, never mi&s;&s;es tho&s;e which
are wounded, digs out the rabbits in the warrens,
di&s;covers the ne&s;ts of partridges and quails, &s;eizes
the mothers on the eggs, and de&s;troys a va&s;t
quantity of game. The wolf is not more noxious
to the pea&s;ant, than the fox to the gentleman.</P>
<P>The chace of the fox requires le&s;s apparatus,
and is more amu&s;ing, than that of the wolf. To
the latter every dog has great reluctance; but all
dogs hunt the fox &s;pontaneou&s;ly and with plea|&s;ure;
for, though his odour be &s;trong, they
often prefer him to the &s;tag or the hare.
He may be hunted with terriers, hounds,
&amp;c. Whenever he finds him&s;elf pur&s;ued, he
runs to his hole; the terriers with crooked
legs, or turn&s;pits, go in with mo&s;t ea&s;e. This
mode an&s;wers very well when we want to carry
off a whole litter of foxes, both mother and
<PB N="217" REF="266">
young. While the mother defends her&s;elf a|gain&s;t
the terriers, the hunters remove the earth
above, and either kill or &s;eize her alive. But,
as the holes are often under rocks, the roots
of trees, or &s;unk too deep in the ground, this me|thod
is frequently un&s;ucce&s;sful. The mo&s;t cer|tain
and mo&s;t common method of hunting foxes,
is to begin with &s;hutting up their hole, to place
a man with a gun near the entrance, and then to
&s;earch about with the dogs. When they fall in
with him, he immediately makes for his hole;
but, when he comes up to it, he is met with a
di&s;charge from the gun. If he e&s;capes the &s;hot,
he flies with full &s;peed, takes a large circuit, and
returns again to the hole, where he is fired up|on
a &s;econd time; but, finding the entrance
&s;hut, he now endeavours to e&s;cape by darting
&s;traight forward, with the de&s;ign of never revi|&s;iting
his former habitation. He is then pur&s;ued
by the hounds, whom he &s;eldom fails to fatigue,
becau&s;e he purpo&s;ely pa&s;&s;es through the thicke&s;t
parts of the fore&s;t or places of the mo&s;t difficult
acce&s;s, where the dogs are hardly able to follow
him; and, when he takes to the plains, he runs
&s;traight out, without &s;topping or doubling.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t effectual mode of de&s;troying fox|es,
is the laying of &s;nares baited with a pigeon,
a live fowl, &amp;c. I once &s;u&s;pended on a tree, at
the height of nine feet, &s;ome meat, bread, and
bones. The foxes had been at &s;evere exerci&s;e
during the night; for, next morning, the earth
<PB N="218" REF="267">
all around was beaten, by their jumping, as
&s;mooth as a barn-floor. The fox is exceeding|ly
voracious; be&s;ide fle&s;h of all kinds, he eats,
with equal avidity, eggs, milk, chee&s;e, fruits,
and particularly grapes. When the young hares
and partridges fail him, he makes war again&s;t
rats, field-mice, &s;erpents, lizards, tods, &amp;c. Of
the&s;e he de&s;troys va&s;t numbers; and this is the
only &s;ervice he does to mankind. He is &s;o fond
of honey, that he attacks the wild bees, wa&s;ps,
and hornets. They at fir&s;t put him to flight by
a thou&s;and &s;tings; but he retires only for the
purpo&s;e of rolling him&s;elf on the ground to cru&s;h
them; and he returns &s;o often to the charge,
that he obliges them to abandon the hive, which
he &s;oon uncovers, and devours both the honey
and wax. In a word, he eats fi&s;hes, lob&s;ters,
gra&s;s-hoppers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fox has a great re&s;emblance to the dog,
e&s;pecially in his internal parts. His head, how|ever,
is larger in proportion to his body; his
ears are al&s;o &s;horter, his tail thicker, his hair
longer and more bu&s;hy, and his eyes more in|clined.
He differs &s;till more from the dog by a
&s;trong offen&s;ive odour which is peculiar to him,
and by his natural di&s;po&s;ition; for he is not ea|&s;ily,
and never fully tamed: He langui&s;hes when
deprived of liberty, and, if kept too long in a
dome&s;tic &s;tate, he dies of chagrin. He does not
copulate with the female dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my experiments on this &s;ubject, article Dog.</NOTE>: If they have
<PB N="219" REF="268">
no rooted antipathy, they are at lea&s;t indifferent
to each other. Foxes produce but once a year;
and the litter commonly con&s;i&s;ts of four or five,
&s;eldom &s;ix, and never le&s;s than three. When
the female is full, &s;he retires, and &s;eldom goes
out of her hole, where &s;he prepares a bed for her
young. She comes in &s;ea&s;on in the winter;
and young foxes are found in the month of A|pril.
When &s;he perceives that her retreat is di&s;|covered,
and that her young have been di&s;turb|ed,
&s;he carries them off one by one, and goes in
&s;earch of another habitation. The young are
brought forth blind; like the dogs, they grow
18 months, or two years, and live 13 or 14
years.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;es of the fox are equally good as
tho&s;e of the wolf; his &s;entiment is more deli|cate;
and the organs of his voice are more pliant
and perfect. The wolf &s;ends forth only fright|ful
howlings; but the fox barks, yelps, and ut|ters
a mournful cry like that of the peacock.
He varies his tones according to the different &s;en|timents
with which he is affected: He has an
accent peculiar to the chace, the tone of de&s;ire,
of complaint, and of &s;orrow. He has another
cry expre&s;&s;ive of acute pain, which he utters
only when he is &s;hot, or has &s;ome of his mem|bers
broken; for he never complains of any o|ther
wound, and, like the wolf, allows him&s;elf
to be killed with a bludgeon without complain|ing;
but he always defends him&s;elf to the la&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="269">
with great courage and bravery. His bite is
ob&s;tinate and dangerous; and the &s;evere&s;t blows
will hardly make him quit his hold. His yelp|ing
is a &s;pecies of barking, and con&s;i&s;ts of a quick
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;imilar tones; at the end of which
he generally rai&s;es his voice &s;imilar to the cry of
the peacock. In winter, and particularly during
fro&s;t and &s;now, he yelps perpetually; but, in
&s;ummer, he is almo&s;t entirely &s;ilent, and, during
this &s;ea&s;on, he ca&s;ts his hair. The &s;kins of young
foxes, and of tho&s;e taken in &s;ummer, are of little
value. The fle&s;h of the fox is not &s;o bad as that
of the wolf: Dogs, and even men, eat it in au|tumn,
e&s;pecially when he has been fattened with
grapes; and his &s;kin in winter makes excellent
furs. He &s;leeps &s;ound, and may be ea&s;ily ap|proached
without wakening: He &s;leeps in a
round form, like the dog; but, when he only
repo&s;es him&s;elf, he extends his hind legs, and lies
on his belly. It is in this &s;ituation that he &s;pies
the birds along the hedges, who have &s;uch an
antipathy to him, that they no &s;ooner perceive
him, than they &s;end forth &s;oft &s;hrill cries to ad|verti&s;e
their neighbours of the enemy's approach.
The jays and black birds, particularly, follow the
fox from tree to tree, &s;ometimes two or three
hundred paces, often repeating the watch-cries.</P>
<P>I brought up &s;ome young foxes: Their offen|&s;ive
odour made it nece&s;&s;ary to keep them in
&s;tables or places which were not much frequent|ed.
This, perhaps, might be one rea&s;on why
<PB N="221" REF="270">
they were le&s;s tame than the wolf, which was
kept nearer the hou&s;e. At the age of five or &s;ix
months, the young foxes pur&s;ued the ducks and
fowls; and, therefore, it became nece&s;&s;ary to
chain them. I kept two males and a female two
years. I tried in vain to make the males copu|late
with bitches: Though they had never &s;een
females of their own &s;pecies, and were &s;timulated
by the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ires of nature, they uniform|ly
rejected the bitches. But, whenever a &s;he-fox
was pre&s;ented to them, though chained, they in|&s;tantly
covered her, and &s;he brought forth four
whelps. The young foxes, who, when at li|berty,
had darted on the poultry, never attempt|ed
to touch a &s;ingle fowl, after they were chain|ed.
A living hen was generally fixed near them
for a whole night; and, though victuals were
kept from them for many hours; yet, in &s;pite of
hunger and of opportunity, they never forgot
that they were chained, and di&s;turbed not the
hen.</P>
<P>The fox is &s;o extremely &s;ubject to the influ|ences
of climate, that the varieties of this &s;pecies
are almo&s;t as numerous as tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic
animals. Mo&s;t of our foxes are reddi&s;h; but
&s;ome of them are found of a &s;ilver gray: In
both, the end of the tail is white. In Burgun|dy,
the latter are called <HI>coal foxes</HI>; becau&s;e their
feet are remarkably black. Their bodies have
al&s;o the appearance of being &s;horter, becau&s;e
they are better clad with hair. There are &s;ome
<PB N="222" REF="271">
who are really longer than the other kinds, and
of a dirty gray colour, nearly the &s;ame with that
of old wolves. But it is uncertain whether this
difference con&s;titutes a real variety, or is produ|ced
by the age of the animal, who, perhaps,
grows whiter as he advances in years. In the
northern regions, the foxes are of all colours,
black, blue, gray, iron-coloured, &s;ilver gray,
white, white with yellow feet, white with black
heads, white with the extremity of the tail black,
reddi&s;h with the throat and belly entirely white;
and, la&s;tly, &s;ome of them have a black line along
the &s;pine, cro&s;&s;ed with another black line over
the &s;houlder. The latter are larger than the
other kinds, and have black throats. The com|mon
&s;pecies are more generally diffu&s;ed than any
of the others. We find them in every part of
Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See les Oeuvres de Renard, tom. 1. p. 175.</NOTE>, in the northern and temperate regions

animal. He retires to the mo&s;t &s;ecret places,
to the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, and there digs
a &s;ubterranean habitation. He &s;eems to fly &s;o|ciety,

<PB N="227" REF="277">
fourths of life in his dark abode, from which he
never departs but in que&s;t of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. As his
body is long, his legs &s;hort, his claws, e&s;pecial|ly

he digs and penetrates the earth with greater

him quit his habitation by force, the fox prac|ti&s;es
every art to render him unea&s;y: He &s;tands
&s;entinel at the entrance of the hole, and even de|files
it with his ordure. He afterwards takes
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, enlarges, and fits it up for his own
accommodation. The badger, though obliged
to change his habitation, leaves not his country.
He goes only to a &s;mall di&s;tance, where he digs
a fre&s;h hole, from which he never removes but
in the night; and, as he never goes far, he re|turns
upon the approach of danger. This is his
only mean of &s;afety; for he cannot e&s;cape by
flight: His legs are too &s;hort for quick motion.
When at &s;ome di&s;tance from his hole, he is &s;oon
overtaken by the dogs. They &s;eldom, however,
accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The
hair of the badger is very thick, and his legs,
jaws, teeth, and claws, are exceedingly &s;trong.
The&s;e natural weapons he u&s;es with courage and
dexterity: He lies on his back, re&s;i&s;ts all the ef|forts
of the dogs, and wounds them in the mo&s;t
dangerous manner. He is, be&s;ides, very tena|cious
<PB N="228" REF="278">
of life, fights long, makes a brave defence,
and per&s;i&s;ts to the very la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Formerly, when badgers were more common,
terriers were trained to hunt and to take them
in their holes. The badger defends him&s;elf by
retiring and throwing back the earth, in order
to &s;top or bury the dogs. He can only be taken
by opening the hole above, after the dogs have
pu&s;hed him to the end of it. The people lay
hold of him with pincers, and then muzzle him,
to prevent his biting. I have kept &s;ome of them,
which had been taken in this manner, a con&s;ide|rable
time. The young ones are ea&s;ily tamed;
they play with the dogs, and follow the per&s;on
who feeds them. But, when taken old, they
continue always &s;avage. They are neither mi&s;|chievous
nor ravenous, like the wolf and fox;
and yet they are carnivorous. They eat every
thing pre&s;ented to them, as fle&s;h, eggs, chee&s;e,
butter, bread, fi&s;h, fruit, nuts, grain, roots, &amp;c.
But raw fle&s;h they prefer to every other food.
They &s;leep the whole night and three fourths of
the day; and yet they are &s;ubject to a lethargic
or benummed &s;tate during winter, like the mar|mottes
or dormice. This great quantity of &s;leep
makes them fat, though they eat but little; and,
for the &s;ame rea&s;on, they can &s;upport hunger
with ea&s;e, and often remain in their holes three
or four days together, e&s;pecially during &s;now.</P>
<P>They keep their habitations extremely clean,
and never defile them with their ordure. The
<PB N="229" REF="279">
male is &s;eldom found with the female. When
about to bring forth, &s;he cuts down the herbage,
bundles it up, and trails it with her feet to the
bottom of the hole, where &s;he makes a commo|dious
bed for her&s;elf and her young. She brings
forth in &s;ummer; and the litter commonly con|&s;i&s;ts
of three or four. When &s;omewhat advan|ced,
&s;he brings them victuals. She now travels
in the night to greater di&s;tances than formerly.
She uncovers the earth from bee-hives, and car|ries
off the honey; &s;he ru&s;hes into the burrows
of rabbits, and &s;eizes their young; &s;he likewi&s;e
lays hold of field-mice, lizards, &s;erpents, gra&s;&s;-hoppers,
and birds eggs, which &s;he conveys to her
offspring, whom &s;he often leads to the mouth
of the hole, in order to &s;uckle or to feed them.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are naturally chilly: Tho&s;e
brought up in the hou&s;e would never quit the
corner of the fire, and often approach &s;o near as
to burn their feet, which do not readily heal.
They are &s;ubject to the itch, and often infect the
dogs which enter their holes, unle&s;s they be after|wards
carefully wa&s;hed. The hair of the badger
is always rude and grea&s;y. Between the anus
and tail, there is a pretty large fi&s;&s;ure, penetra|ting
only about an inch deep, from which con|tinually
exudes an unctuous ill &s;cented liquor,
which the animal is found of &s;ucking. The fle&s;h
of the badger has not a very bad ta&s;te; and
coar&s;e furs, collars for dogs, coverings for hor&s;es,
&amp;c. are made of his &s;kin.</P>

never &s;pread beyond Spain, France, Italy, Ger|many,

every where very &s;carce. The badger admits
not only of no varieties, but he even approaches
not to any other &s;pecies. His characters are
deeply marked, and very &s;ingular. The alter|nate

<P>THE Otter is a voracious animal, but fonder
of fi&s;h than of fle&s;h: He never quits the
margins of rivers or of lakes, and often depopu|lates
the fi&s;h-ponds. He &s;wims with more ea&s;e
than the beaver; for the latter has membranes
on his hind-feet only, and the toes of his fore|feet
are &s;eparate; but the otter has membranes
on all his feet. He &s;wims almo&s;t as quick as he
walks. He never goes to the &s;ea like the bea|ver;
but traver&s;es the fre&s;h waters and rivers
to very con&s;iderable di&s;tances. He often &s;wims
<PB N="233" REF="284">
under the water, and, after remaining pretty
long, a&s;cends to the &s;urface for air. Properly
&s;peaking, he is not an amphibious animal, or an
animal that can live equally in air or in water.
He is not formed for continuing in the latter ele|ment;
for, like other terre&s;trial creatures, he re|quires
the aid of re&s;piration. When in pur&s;uit
of a fi&s;h, if he chances to be entangled in a net,
he drowns; and we perceive that he has not had
time to cut a &s;ufficient quantity of the me&s;hes to
effectuate his e&s;cape. His teeth re&s;emble tho&s;e
of the martin; but they are proportionally long|er
and &s;tronger. For want of fi&s;hes, crabs, frogs,
water-rats, or other food, he gnaws the young
twigs, and eats the bark of aquatic trees; he
likewi&s;e eats the young herbage in the &s;pring.
He is neither afraid of cold nor of moi&s;ture.
The female comes in &s;ea&s;on in winter, brings
forth in March, and the litter con&s;i&s;ts of three or
four. Young animals are generally beautiful;
but the young otter is not &s;o hand&s;ome as the
old. A head ill-&s;haped, ears placed low, eyes
&s;mall and covered, a lurid a&s;pect, aukward mo|tions,
an ignoble and deformed figure, and a kind
of mechanical cry which he repeats every mo|ment,
&s;eem to indicate a &s;tupid animal. The ot|ter,
however, acquires indu&s;try with age, &s;uf|ficient,
at lea&s;t, to carry on a &s;ucce&s;sful war a|gain&s;t
the fi&s;hes, who, both with regard to &s;en|timent
and in&s;tinct, are much inferior to other
animals. But I can hardly allow him to have
<PB N="234" REF="285">
the talents of the beaver, or even the habits a&s;cri|bed
to him, &s;uch as that of always a&s;cending the
rivers, in order to &s;wim the more ea&s;ily down
the current, when loaded with his prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ge&s;ner. hi&s;t. quad. p. 685.</NOTE> that
of fitting up and flooring his hou&s;e to exclude
the water; that of hoarding a &s;tore of fi&s;hes, in
ca&s;e of a &s;carcity; and, la&s;tly, that of being ea|&s;ily
tamed, of fi&s;hing for his ma&s;ter, and even
bringing the fi&s;h into the kitchen. All I know
is, that the otters dig no habitations for them|&s;elves;
that they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t hole
they find, under the roots of poplars or willows,
in the cliffs of rocks, and even in piles of float|ing
wood; that they depo&s;it their young on beds
made of twigs and herbs; that we find in their
habitations, heads and bones of fi&s;hes; that they
often change their places of abode; that they
bani&s;h their young at the end of &s;ix weeks or two
months; that tho&s;e I attempted to tame, endea|voured
to bite, though they were only taking
milk, and unable to eat fi&s;h; that &s;ome days af|ter,
they became more gentle, perhaps becau&s;e
they were weak or &s;ick; that, &s;o far from be|ing
ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to a dome&s;tic life, all of
them which I attempted to bring up, died young;
that the otter is naturally of a &s;avage and cruel
di&s;po&s;ition; that, when he gets into a fi&s;h pond,
he is equally de&s;tructive as the polecat in a hen|hou&s;e;
that he kills many more fi&s;hes than he
can eat, and then carries off one in his mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="286">
Though the otter does not ca&s;t his hair, his
&s;kin is browner, and &s;ells dearer in winter than
in &s;ummer; it makes a very fine fur. His fle&s;h
has a di&s;agreeable fi&s;hy ta&s;te. His retreats ex|hale
a noxious odour, from the remains of pu|trid
fi&s;hes; and his own body has a bad &s;mell.
The dogs chace the otter &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and ea&s;ily
apprehend him when at a di&s;tance from water
or from his hole. But, when &s;eized, he defends
him&s;elf, bites the dogs mo&s;t cruelly, and &s;ome|times
with &s;uch force as to break their leg-bones,
and never quits his hold till death loo&s;es his
jaws. The beaver, however, who is not a very
&s;trong animal, pur&s;ues the otters, and permits
them not to live upon the banks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
latter.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies, though not very numerous, is
&s;pread over Europe from Sweden to Naples; and
we find them even in North America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See le voyage de la Hontan, tom. 2. p. 38.</NOTE>. They
were well known to the Greeks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ari&s;t. Hi&s;t. animal. lib. 8. cap. 5.</NOTE>, and probably
extend over all the temperate climates, e&s;pecially
in places which abound with water; for the otter
can neither dwell in burning &s;ands, nor in dry
de&s;erts. He equally flies barren rivers, and tho&s;e
that are too much frequented. I believe none
of them are to be found in very warm countries;

<P>Pontoppidan a&s;&s;ures us, that, in Norway, the
otters frequent the &s;alt as well as the fre&s;h wa|ters;
and that they live among the fragments
of rocks, from which the hunters decoy them
by imitating their voice, which con&s;i&s;ts of a low
kind of whi&s;tle. He adds, that they eat only
the fatty parts of fi&s;hes; and that a tamed otter,
which was fed with milk, brought fi&s;h daily to
the hou&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pontop. Nat. Hi&s;t. of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In &s;ome notes communicated by M. de la
Borde, I find that there are three &s;pecies of ot|ters
in Cayenne; the black, which weighs 40 or
50 pounds; the yellowi&s;h, which weighs 20 or
<PB N="237" REF="288">
25 pounds; and the &s;mall grayi&s;h kind, which
weighs not above three or four pounds. He
farther remarks, that the&s;e animals are very fre|quent
in Guiana, along the rivers and mar&s;hes
where fi&s;hes abound: They &s;ometimes appear in
numerous troops, and are &s;o fierce that they
cannot be approached. Their bite is cruel, and
they defend them&s;elves again&s;t the dogs. They
litter in holes which they dig in the banks.
They are often tamed and brought up in hou&s;es.
I have remarked, &s;ays M. de la Borde, that all
the animals of Guiana are ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to
a dome&s;tic &s;tate, and become even trouble&s;ome
by their familiarity.</P>
<P>M. Aublet, a learned botani&s;t formerly quoted,
and M. Olivier, &s;urgeon to the King, who have
long re&s;ided in Cayenne, affirm, that there are
otters in that country &s;o large, that they weigh
90 and 100 pounds. They live in the great and
unfrequented rivers, and their heads often ap|pear
above the water. Their cry is heard at
great di&s;tances; their hair is very &s;oft, but &s;hort|er
than that of the beaver, and generally of a
dark brown colour. They live upon fi&s;h, and
eat likewi&s;e the grains which fall into the water
from the banks of the rivers.</P>
<P>I have added the figure of a &s;mall ani|mal
&s;ent me from Guiana, under the name of
<HI>the &s;mall fre&s;h-water otter of Cayenne,</HI> which
appears to be the third &s;pecies mentioned by M.
la Borde. It is only &s;even inches long, from
<PB N="238" REF="289">
the end of the no&s;e to the extremity of the body.
The tail of this &s;mall otter, like that of the wa|ter-rat,
has no hair; its length is &s;ix inches &s;e|ven
lines, and five lines thick at the origin, di|mini&s;hing
gradually to the extremity, which is
white, though the re&s;t of the tail is brown; and,
in place of hair, it is covered with a rough gra|nulated
&s;kin, like chagreen; it is flat below and
convex above. The whi&s;kers, and the long
hairs under the eye, are about an inch in length.
All the under part of the body and head, as well
as the fore-part of the fore-legs, is white. The
top and &s;ides of the head and body are marked
with large browni&s;h black &s;pots, and the inter|vals
are of a yellowi&s;h gray colour. The black
&s;pots corre&s;pond on each &s;ide of the body. There
is a white &s;pot above the eye. The ears are
large, and &s;eem to be longer than tho&s;e of the
common otter. The legs are &s;hort; the fore|feet
have five unconnected toes; there are the
&s;ame number in the hind-feet, but they are con|nected
with membranes.</P>

<P>MOST naturali&s;ts have de&s;cribed the Mar|tin
and the pine-wea&s;el, or yellow-brea&s;ted
martin, as animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.
Ge&s;ner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, Hi&s;t. quad. p. 76. Ray, &s;ynop&s;. quad. p. 200.</NOTE> and Ray, in imitation of Albertus,
affirm, that they intermix promi&s;cuou&s;ly. This
fact, however, which is &s;upported by no other
evidence, appears, at lea&s;t, to be doubtful: I be|lieve,
on the contrary, that the&s;e animals have
no intercour&s;e, but form two di&s;tinct and inde|pendent
<PB N="240" REF="293">
pendent &s;pecies. To illu&s;trate this point, I &s;hall
give a few rea&s;ons. If the pine-wea&s;el were
only a wild martin, or the martin a dome&s;tic
pine-wea&s;el, the fir&s;t would con&s;tantly pre&s;erve
the &s;ame characters, and the latter would be
&s;ubject to variations; as the wild cat uniformly
remains the &s;ame, while the dome&s;tic cat a&s;&s;umes
all &s;orts of colours. The martin, on the con|trary,
never varies, but pre&s;erves its peculiar cha|racters
as con&s;tantly as the pine-wea&s;el retains
tho&s;e which are proper to it. This alone is a &s;uf|ficient
proof, that tho&s;e two animals are &s;pecifi|cally
different, and that the one is not a &s;imple
variety of the other. Be&s;ides, there is no rea|&s;on
for regarding the martin as a dome&s;tic ani|mal:
He is no more dome&s;tic than the fox or the
polecats, who, like him, approach the habitations
of men in que&s;t of their prey; and he has no
greater communication with mankind than the
other animals we call wild or &s;avage. The mar|tin,
therefore, differs from the pine-wea&s;el both
in di&s;po&s;ition and temperament; for the latter flies
the open fields, lives in the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es
of the fore&s;t, and is never found, in great num|bers,
in cold climates: But the martin approaches
our habitations, takes up his abode in old build|ings,
in hay-lofts, and in holes of the walls.
The &s;pecies is likewi&s;e &s;pread in great numbers
over all the temperate countries, and is even
found in warm regions, as in Madaga&s;car<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyages de Struys, tom. 1. p. 30.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="241" REF="294">
the Maldiva i&s;lands<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Pyrard, tom. 1. p. 132.</NOTE>, and is never &s;een in high
latitudes.</P>
<P>The martin has a fine countenance, a lively
eye, &s;upple limbs, and a flexible body. His
movements are all exceedingly nimble; he rather
bounds and leaps, than walks. He climbs rough
walls with ea&s;e and alacrity; enters the pigeon
or hen-hou&s;es, eats the eggs, pigeons, fowls, &amp;c.
and the female often kills great numbers, and
tran&s;ports them to her young. He likewi&s;e
&s;eizes mice, rats, moles, and birds in their ne&s;t.
I kept one of the&s;e animals a con&s;iderable time.
He tamed to a certain degree; but never form|ed
any attachment, and continued always &s;o wild
that it was nece&s;&s;ary to chain him. He made
war again&s;t the rats, and attacked the poultry,
whenever they came in his way. He often got
loo&s;e, though chained by the middle of the body.
At fir&s;t, he went to no great di&s;tance, and re|turned
in a few hours, but without di&s;covering
any &s;ymptoms of joy or of affection to any par|ticular
per&s;on. He, however, called for victuals,
like a cat or a dog. Afterwards he made longer
excur&s;ions, and, at la&s;t, he thought proper ne|ver
to return. He was then about a year and a
half old, &s;eemingly the age at which nature a&s;|&s;umes
her full a&s;cendency. He eat every thing
pre&s;ented to him, except &s;alad and herbs. He
was fond of honey, and preferred hemp-&s;eed
to every other grain. We remarked, that he
<PB N="242" REF="295">
drank very often; that he &s;ometimes &s;lept two
days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; that, at other times, he would
&s;leep none for two or three days; that, before
&s;leeping, he folded him&s;elf in a round form, and
covered his head with his tail; and that, while
awake, his motions were &s;o violent, &s;o perpetual,
and &s;o incommodious, that, though he had not
di&s;turbed the fowls, we found it nece&s;&s;ary to
chain him, to prevent him from breaking every
thing. We have had in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal other
martins of a more advanced age, which had been
taken in nets; but they continued to be totally
&s;avage, bit all who attempted to touch them, and
would eat nothing but raw fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Martins, it is &s;aid, go with young as long as
cats. We meet with young ones from &s;pring
to autumn; and, therefore, it is probable that they
bring forth more than once a year. The younger
females litter only three or four at a time; but
the more aged produce &s;ix or &s;even. When a|bout
to bring forth, they take up their abode in
magazines of hay, in holes of walls, which
they &s;tuff with &s;traw and herbs, in clefts of rocks,
or in the hollow trunks of trees; and, when di|&s;turbed,
they remove their young, who &s;eem to
grow very &s;oon to maturity; for the one I kept
had nearly attained its full growth in one year;
Hence we may conclude, that tho&s;e animals live
only eight or ten years. They have a kind of
mu&s;ky &s;mell, which is not very di&s;agreeable.
The pine-wea&s;el and the martin, like &s;ome other
<PB N="243" REF="296">
animals, have two ve&s;icles, one on each &s;ide of
the extremity of the rectum, which contain an
odoriferous matter, &s;imilar to that procured from
the civet cat. Their fle&s;h retains a little of this
odour; and yet that of the pine-wea&s;el is not
bad. The fle&s;h of the martin is more di&s;agree|able,
and his &s;kin is likewi&s;e much le&s;s valuable.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have added the figure of an American ani|mal,
which was &s;ent from Guiana to M. Aubry,
curate of St Louis. Though this animal wants
the teeth, it is &s;o &s;imilar in all the other parts of
the body to the common martin, that it may be
regarded as a variety of that &s;pecies. It differs
from the martin only in having the colour of the
hair &s;prinkled with black and white, a &s;horter
tail, and &s;pots on the head. The martin of Gui|ana
is three or four inches longer than the Eu|ropean;
but the tail is proportionally &s;horter.
The muzzle &s;eems al&s;o to be longer; it is black,
and the blackne&s;s extends above the eyes, pa&s;&s;es
under the ears along the neck, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in
the brown hair of the &s;houlders. There is a large
white &s;pace above the eyes, which &s;preads upon
the front, &s;urrounds the ears, forms a narrow
band along the neck, and di&s;appears on the &s;houl|ders.
The ears are perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of
<PB N="244" REF="297">
the martin. The top of the head is gray, mixed
with white; the neck is brown, inter&s;per&s;ed with
a&s;h-coloured hairs; and the body is covered
with a mixture of white and blacki&s;h hairs.
The&s;e hairs are gray and a&s;h-coloured at their
origin, then brown, and black and white at the
extremities. The under part of thejaw is of a
blacki&s;h brown colour, which extends under the
neck, and vani&s;hes towards the belly, which is of
a bright brown or che&s;nut. The legs and feet are
covered with &s;hining reddi&s;h black hair; and the
toes have a greater re&s;emblance to the toes of
the &s;quirrel and rat than to tho&s;e of the martin.
The great toes of the fore-feet are four lines
long; but tho&s;e of the hind-feet only two. The
tail is more bu&s;hy at the origin than the extre|mity,
and the hair of it is che&s;nut or a bright
brown mixed with black.</P>
<P>We have given the figure of another Cayenne
animal, which &s;eems to have a great analogy to
the former. It was drawn from the life at the
fair of St Germain, in 1768, and mea&s;ured 15
inches from the tip of the no&s;e to the origin of
the tail, which was eight inches, and more bu&s;hy
at the root than at the extremity. This animal
is &s;hort legged, like our martins: The form of
the head approaches nearly to that of the martin;
but in the ears there is no re&s;emblance. The body
is covered with woolly hair: There are five toes
on each foot, armed with &s;mall claws like tho&s;e
of the martin.</P>

<P>THIS animal is a native of northern
regions, where the &s;pecies is &s;o nume|rous,
that the quantity of their furs annually
con&s;umed is perfectly a&s;toni&s;hing. There are
very few of them in the temperate climates, and
they exi&s;t not in very warm countries. Some
of them are found in the fore&s;ts of Burgundy,
and likewi&s;e in tho&s;e of Fountainbleau; but, in
general, they are as rare in France as the martin
is frequent. There are none of tho&s;e animals in
Britain; becau&s;e they have no exten&s;ive fore&s;ts
in that country. They fly equally inhabited
countries and uncovered fields. They dwell in
the woods, and conceal not them&s;elves among
<PB N="246" REF="302">
the rocks, but traver&s;e the fore&s;t and climb the
trees. They live by hunting, and de&s;troy pro|digious
quantities of birds, by eating their eggs.
They &s;eize &s;quirrels, field-mice, &amp;c. They al|&s;o
eat honey, like the martin and polecat. They
never appear in the open fields, in the meadows,
or in the vineyards. They approach not the
dwellings of men; and they differ &s;till farther
from the martin in their manner of making their
e&s;cape from the hunters. When the martin is
pur&s;ued by a dog, he in&s;tantly runs to his hay|loft
or his hole. The pine-wea&s;el, on the con|trary,
runs a long time before the dogs, then
climbs the trunk of a tree, and, from this &s;tation,
he views them as they pa&s;s. The track which he
leaves in the &s;now appears to be that of a large
animal, becau&s;e he always leaps, and both feet
make but one mark. He is &s;omewhat larger
than the martin, and yet his head is &s;horter. His
legs are longer, and con&s;equently he runs more
ea&s;ily. His neck is yellow; but that of the
martin is white. His hair is finer, more bu&s;hy,
and le&s;s &s;ubject to fall off. The female pre|pares
not a bed for her young; and yet lodges
them mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly. The &s;quirrels build
ne&s;ts in the tops of trees, with equal art as the
birds. When the pine-wea&s;el is about to bring
forth, &s;he climbs to the &s;quirrel's ne&s;t, bani&s;hes
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, enlarges the entry to it, and there
depo&s;its her young. She likewi&s;e u&s;es the old
ne&s;ts of ducks or buzzards, and holes of antient
<PB N="247" REF="303">
trees, from which &s;he di&s;lodges the wood-peckers
and others birds. She brings forth in the &s;pring,
and her litter con&s;i&s;ts only of two or three.
Though her young come into the world blind,
they &s;oon acquire a con&s;iderable growth. She
brings to them eggs and birds; and afterwards
leads them out to hunt along with her&s;elf. The
birds are &s;o well acquainted with their enemies,
that, when they perceive the pine-wea&s;el, they
utter the &s;ame mournful cry to adverti&s;e his ap|proach,
as when they &s;ee a fox. What &s;hows
that the birds are animated with hatred, rather
than fear, is, that they follow at a di&s;tance, and
utter this peculiar cry again&s;t all carnivorous a|nimals,
as the wolf, the fox, the pine-wea&s;el,
the wild cat, &amp;c. but never again&s;t the &s;tag,
the roe, the hare, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pine-wea&s;els are very frequent in the
northern parts of America, Europe, and A&s;ia.
Many of them are brought from Canada, and
they extend as far as Hud&s;on's bay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lade's Voyages, vol. 2. p. 227.</NOTE>; and, in
A&s;ia, as far north as the kingdom of Tonquin<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tavernier, tom. 4. p. 182. Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 7. p. 117.</NOTE>
and the empire of China<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 6. p. 562.</NOTE>. They ought not to
be confounded with the &s;able, an animal who&s;e
fur is much more precious. The &s;able is black;
but the pine-wea&s;el is brown and yellow. The
mo&s;t valuable part of the &s;kin of the latter is
the brown, which extends along the whole back
to the extremity of the tail.</P>

<P>THE polecat has a great re&s;emblance to the
martin in temperament, di&s;po&s;ition, man|ners,
and figure. Like the latter, he approach|es
our habitations, mounts on the roofs, takes
up his abode in hay-lofts, barns, and unfrequent|ed
places, from which he i&s;&s;ues during the night
only, in que&s;t of prey. He &s;teals &s;lily into the
court-yards, voleries, and pigeon-hou&s;es, where,
with le&s;s noi&s;e than the martin, he makes great|er
havock, cutting off the heads of all the fowls,
and then tran&s;porting them one by one to his
magazine. If, as frequently happens, he can|not
carry them off entire, on account of the
&s;mallne&s;s of the entry to his hole, he eats the
<PB REF="305">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>Plate LXXIII. YELLOW BREASTED WEASEL</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="249" REF="306">
brains, and takes only their heads along with
him. He is likewi&s;e very fond of honey, at|tacks
the hives in winter, and forces the bees to
abandon them. He never retires far from the
abodes of men. The &s;pring is their &s;ea&s;on of
love: The males fight for the female on the
roofs of hou&s;es. They afterwards leave her, and
go to pa&s;s the &s;ummer in the fields or in the
woods. The female, on the contrary, continues
in her habitation till &s;he brings forth, and leads
not off her young till toward the end of &s;ummer.
She litters three or four, and &s;ometimes five,
&s;uckles them but a &s;hort time, and early accu&s;toms
them to eat blood and eggs.</P>
<P>In the villages, they live upon poultry; and,
in the country, they hunt for prey. During the
&s;ummer, they take up their abode in rabbit|holes,
in the cliffs of rocks, or in the hollow
trunks of trees, from which they i&s;&s;ue out in the
night, and roam about the fields and woods,
&s;earching for the ne&s;ts of partridges, larks, and
quails. They climb trees in que&s;t of the ne&s;ts
of other birds. They lie in watch for rats,
field-mice, and moles; and carry on a perpetual
war again&s;t the rabbits, who cannot e&s;cape them,
as they enter with ea&s;e into their holes. A
&s;ingle family of polecats is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy
a whole warren. This would be a &s;imple me|thod
of dimini&s;hing the number of rabbits in
places where they are too abundant.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="307">
The polecat is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the mar|tin:
His tail is al&s;o &s;horter, his muzzle &s;harper,
and his hair blacker and more bu&s;hy: He has
white hair on his front, and likewi&s;e on the &s;ides
of the no&s;e and round the mouth. He differs
&s;till more from the martin in his voice; the mar|tin
has a &s;harp piercing cry; the cry of the pole|cat
is blunter. Each of them, as well as the
pine-wea&s;el and &s;quirrel, have a deep grunting
tone, which they often repeat when irritated.
La&s;tly, the odour of the martin is very different
from that of the polecat, which, in&s;tead of being
agreeable, is extremely foetid; and, from this
circum&s;tance, the animal obtained its Latin name
<HI>putorius.</HI> He &s;ends forth this in&s;upportable
odour to a great di&s;tance, e&s;pecially when irri|tated.
The dogs will not eat the fle&s;h of the
polecat; and even his &s;kin, though good, is in
no e&s;timation, becau&s;e it never lo&s;es entirely its
natural &s;mell. This odour proceeds from two
ve&s;icles near the anus, from which an unctuous
matter continually exudes; and the effluvia of
it is extremely offen&s;ive in the polecat, ferret,
wea&s;el, badger, &amp;c.; but it con&s;titutes, on the
contrary, a &s;pecies of perfume, in the civet-cat,
pine-wea&s;el, martin, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The polecat &s;eems to be confined to the tem|perate
climates: Few or none of them are found
in the northern regions; and, in warm countries,
they are &s;till more rare than the pine-wea&s;el.
The meles Surinamen&s;is, or &s;tifling wea&s;el, is an

appears to be bounded, in Europe, from Italy to
Poland. This animal, it is certain, avoids the

and his &s;teps are never &s;een in the &s;now, either
in the woods or in fields which are di&s;tant from

<P>WHETHER the ferret and polecat belong
to different &s;pecies, has been a &s;ubject of
doubt with &s;ome naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Linn, Sy&s;t. ibid.</NOTE>. The re&s;emblance
of colour of &s;ome ferrets to that of the polecat
may have given ri&s;e to this doubt. The polecat,
however, is a native of temperate climates, and
is a wild animal, like the martin. But, the fer|ret
is a native of warm countries, and cannot
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, even in France, unle&s;s in a dome&s;tic &s;tate.
The ferret alone is u&s;ed in hunting rabbits, be|cau&s;e
he is more ea&s;ily tamed than the polecat.
Both, indeed, have a &s;trong and di&s;agreeable
odour. But the mo&s;t convincing proof of their
being different animals, is, that they have no in|tercour&s;e
with one another, and differ in a num|ber
<PB N="253" REF="311">
of e&s;&s;ential characters. The body of the
ferret is thinner and more lengthened, his head
narrower, and his muzzle &s;harper, than tho&s;e of
the polecat. He is not endowed with the &s;ame
in&s;tinct in finding &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but, at lea&s;t in
our climates, mu&s;t be carefully nouri&s;hed with|in
doors, and cannot exi&s;t in the fields; for tho&s;e
who are lo&s;t in the burrows of rabbits never
multiply, but probably peri&s;h during the winter.
The ferret al&s;o, like other dome&s;tic animals,
varies in colour; and is equally common in
warm regions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ferret is found in Barbary, and is called <HI>Nim&s;e.</HI> See Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, as the polecat is rare.</P>
<P>The female ferret is le&s;s than the male: When
in &s;ea&s;on, &s;he is &s;o extremely ardent, that, we
are a&s;&s;ured, &s;he dies, if her de&s;ires be not gratifi|ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner. hi&s;t. quad. p. 763.</NOTE>.
Ferrets are brought up in ca&s;ks or boxes,
where they are furni&s;hed with beds of hemp or
flax. They &s;leep almo&s;t continually. Whene|ver
they awake, they &s;earch eagerly for food,
which con&s;i&s;ts of brawn, bread, milk, &amp;c. They
produce twice every year: The female goes &s;ix
weeks with young: Some of them devour their
young as &s;oon as they are brought forth, in&s;tantly
come again in &s;ea&s;on, and have three litters,
which generally con&s;i&s;t of five or &s;ix, and &s;ome|times
&s;even or eight, and even nine.</P>
<P>This animal is by nature a mortal enemy to
the rabbit. Whenever a dead rabbit is, for the
fir&s;t time, pre&s;ented to a young ferret, he flies
<PB N="254" REF="312">
upon it, and bites it with fury; but, if it be
alive, he &s;eizes it by the throat or the no&s;e, and
&s;ucks its blood. When let into the burrows of
rabbits, he is muzzled, that he may not kill them
in their holes, but only oblige them to come out,
in order to be caught in the nets. If the ferret
is let in without a muzzle, he is in danger of
being lo&s;t; for, after &s;ucking the blood of the
rabbit, he falls a&s;leep; and even &s;moking the hole
is not a certain method of recalling him; be|cau&s;e
the holes have often &s;everal entries which
communicate with each other, and the ferret re|tires
into one of the&s;e, when incommoded with
the &s;moke. Boys likewi&s;e u&s;e the ferret for
catching birds in the holes of walls or of old
trees.</P>
<P>According to Strabo, the ferret was brought
from Africa into Spain; which is by no means
improbable, as Spain is the native climate of rab|bits,
and the country where formerly the&s;e ani|mals
mo&s;t abounded. It may, therefore, be pre|&s;umed,
that, in order to dimini&s;h their number,
which perhaps was incommodious, ferrets were
imported for the purpo&s;e of hunting rabbits in a
profitable manner, in place of multiplying mar|tins,
which would have de&s;troyed the rabbits
without bringing any advantage to the hunters.</P>
<P>The ferret, though ea&s;ily tamed and rendered
docile, is extremely ira&s;cible. His odour is al|ways
di&s;agreeable; but, when he is irritated, it
becomes much more offen&s;ive. His eyes are
<PB N="255" REF="313">
lively, and his a&s;pect is inflammatory; all his
movements are nimble, and he is, at the &s;ame
time, &s;o vigorous, that he can ea&s;ily ma&s;ter a
rabbit, though at lea&s;t four times larger than
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the authority of commenta|tors,
it is &s;till uncertain whether the ferret be the
<HI>ictis</HI> of the Greeks. 'The ictis,' &s;ays Ari&s;totle,
'is a &s;pecies of wild wea&s;el, &s;maller than the
little Malte&s;e dog, but re&s;embling the wea&s;el
in its hair, in the whitene&s;s of the under part
of the body, and likewi&s;e in the craftine&s;s of
its manners. It admits of being tamed; and
makes great havock among the bee-hives, be|ing
extremely found of honey. It al&s;o attacks
birds, and, like the cat, has an o&s;&s;eous penis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. anim. lib. 9. cap. 6.</NOTE>.'
1. There appears to be a contradiction in &s;aying
that the ictis is a &s;pecies of wild wea&s;el, which
admits of being tamed; for the common wea&s;el,
which, in this country, is the mo&s;t &s;avage of the
two, is perfectly irreclaimable. 2. The ferret,
though larger than the wea&s;el, can never be com|pared,
for &s;ize, to the lap-dog. 3. The ferret
appears not to have the cunning of the wea&s;el,
nor indeed any craftine&s;s at all: La&s;tly, he never
attacks the bee-hives, nor is he fond of honey.
I inquired of M. le Roi, in&s;pector of the royal
chaces, concerning this la&s;t fact. His an&s;wer
follows: 'M. de Buffon may be a&s;&s;ured, that
the ferrets have no predilection for honey;
<PB N="256" REF="314">
but, when hungry, may be made to eat to it.
I have fed them &s;everal days with bread &s;oak|ed
in water mixed with honey. The two la&s;t
days, they eat it in pretty large quantities; but
the weake&s;t of them began to be &s;en&s;ibly ema|ciated.'
This is not the fir&s;t time that M. le
Roi has obliged me with important facts. Ha|ving
no ferrets, I tried the &s;ame experiment on
the ermine, by giving him only pure honey to
eat, and a little milk for drink: But he died
in a few days. Thus neither the ermine nor the
ferret are fond of honey, like the ictis of the
antients; which inclines me to think, that the
word <HI>ictis</HI> is perhaps only a generic name; or,
if it marks any particular &s;pecies, it ought rather
to be applied to the martin or polecat, both of
which po&s;&s;e&s;s the craftine&s;s of the wea&s;el, attack
the bee-hives, and are extremely fond of honey.</P>

<P>THE Wea&s;el is as common in temperate and
warm climates<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The wea&s;el is found in Barbary, and is called <HI>Fert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">el Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"></HI>; Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, as it is rare in the nor|thern
regions. The ermine, on the contrary, a|bounds
in the north, is &s;eldom met with in
temperate climates, and never in warm countries.
The&s;e animals, therefore, form two di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies.
The common wea&s;el &s;ometimes turns
white during the winter, even in our climate.
This circum&s;tance might give ri&s;e to its being
regarded as of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the ermine.
This mark is common to both: But there are
others in which they differ. The ermine is red|di&s;h
in &s;ummer and white in winter; but the
end of its tail is uniformly black. The end of
the wea&s;el's tail is yellow, even when the animal
<PB N="258" REF="318">
turns white in winter. It is, be&s;ides, always
le&s;s, and its tail much &s;horter than that of the
ermine. The wea&s;el dwells not, like the er|mine,
in woods and de&s;erts, but near the habi|tations
of men. I have kept both &s;pecies toge|ther;
but animals which differ in climate, in
con&s;titution, and in di&s;po&s;ition, never intermix.
It is true, &s;ome wea&s;els are larger or &s;maller than
others; but the difference never exceeds an inch
in the whole length of the body. But the er|mine
is two inches longer than the large&s;t wea|&s;el.
Neither of them can be tamed, but are
kept wild in iron cages. Neither of them
voluntarily eat honey, nor attack the bee|hives,
like the polecat and martin. Thus
the ermine is not the &s;avage wea&s;el, nor the
ictis of Ari&s;totle, which, he &s;ays, is ea&s;ily
tamed, and very fond of honey. The wea&s;el
and ermine, in&s;tead of being ea&s;ily tamed, are &s;o
wild, that they will not eat when any per&s;on
looks at them: They are in perpetual agitation,
always endeavouring to conceal them&s;elves: And,
if a man wants to keep them, he mu&s;t furni&s;h
them with a bundle of wool or flax, in which
they wrap and hide them&s;elves from the light.
Thither they drag every thing they can lay hold
of, and never eat but in the night. They allow
fre&s;h meat to lie three or four days, and even till
it corrupt, before they touch it. They &s;leep
three fourths of the day, and watch their prey
during the night. When a wea&s;el gets among
the poultry, he attacks not the cocks or old hens,
<PB N="259" REF="319">
but &s;ingles out the chickens and young birds,
whom he kills with a &s;ingle bite on the head,
and then carries off the whole one by one. He
likewi&s;e breaks the eggs, and &s;ucks them with
incredible avidity. In winter, they generally
live in granaries and barns, where they often re|main
during the &s;pring, and bring forth their
young among the hay and &s;traw. During this
period, the female makes war, with more &s;ucce&s;s
than the cat, again&s;t the rats and mice, who can|not
e&s;cape her, becau&s;e &s;he follows them into
their holes. She mounts the pigeon-hou&s;es,
and de&s;troys the pigeons, &s;parrows, &amp;c. In
&s;ummer, they retire farther from hou&s;es, e&s;peci|ally
into low grounds, about mills, along rivu|lets,
conceal them&s;elves among bru&s;h-wood, in
order to &s;urpri&s;e birds, and often take up their
abode in old willows, where the female brings
forth her young: She prepares for them a bed
of &s;traw, leaves, and other herbage, and litters,
in the &s;pring, from three to five. The young,
like tho&s;e of the polecat, pine-wea&s;el, and mar|tin,
are born blind; but they very &s;oon acquire
growth and &s;trength enough to follow their mo|ther
in the chace. The wea&s;els attack &s;erpents,
water-rats, moles, field-mice, &amp;c. and, over|running
the meadows, they devour quails and
partridges, together with their eggs. Their mo|tion
con&s;i&s;ts of inequal and precipitant leaps;
and, when they want to mount a tree, they make
a &s;udden bound, by which they are at once ele|vated
<PB N="260" REF="320">
&s;everal feet high. They leap in the &s;ame
manner when they attempt to &s;eize a bird.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, as well as the polecat and fer|ret,
have a di&s;agreeable odour, which is &s;tronger
in &s;ummer than in winter; and, when pur&s;ued
or irritated, their &s;mell is felt at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance. They move always with caution and
with &s;ilence, and never cry, but when they are
hurt. Their cry is &s;harp, rough, and very ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of re&s;entment. As their own odour is
offen&s;ive, they &s;eem not to be &s;en&s;ible of a bad
&s;mell in other bodies. A pea&s;ant in my neigh|bourhood
took three new-littered wea&s;els out of
the carca&s;s of a wolf that had been hung on a
tree by the hind feet. The wolf was almo&s;t en|tirely
putrified, and the female wea&s;el had made
a ne&s;t of leaves and herbage for her young in
the thorax of this putrid carca&s;s.</P>

<P>The author here ingenuou&s;ly quotes a letter
he received from the Counte&s;s of Noyan, dated

that he had injured the character of the wea&s;el,

he went. The method of taming them is, to
&s;troke them often and gently over the back, and
to threaten, and even beat them, when they bite.
Their odour is never offen&s;ive, but when they
are irritated. They are fed with milk, boiled
fle&s;h, and water; and, unle&s;s they be &s;tarved,

<P>THE wea&s;el with a black tail, is called the
<HI>ermine,</HI> and <HI>ro&s;elet</HI> by the French; the
<HI>ermine</HI> when it is white, and the <HI>ro&s;elet</HI> when it
is red or yellowi&s;h. Though le&s;s frequent than
the ordinary wea&s;el, they are &s;till found in con|&s;iderable
numbers, e&s;pecially in the antient fo|re&s;ts,
and &s;ometimes, during winter, in fields
bordering upon woods. It is ea&s;y, at all &s;ea&s;ons,
to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the common wea&s;el;
<PB N="263" REF="323">
for the end of their tail is always of a deep black,
and the borders of the ears and toes are white.</P>
<P>We have little to add to what we formerly
remarked concerning this animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, article Wea&s;el.</NOTE>. We &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that it changes its colour, as u&s;ual,
in winter. I had one &s;ent me, in the beginning of
March 1757, which was then white. I kept it
till April 1758, when it would probably have
become white, had it been at liberty; but it was
confined in an iron cage, again&s;t the bars of
which it perpetually rubbed, and, as it had not
been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed to the cold, it &s;till pre|&s;erved
its &s;ummer coat. It remains as &s;avage as
ever, and has lo&s;t nothing of its bad &s;mell. In
every other circum&s;tance, it is a healthy vivaci|ous
animal, has lively eyes, a fine countenance,
and movements &s;o rapid, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to
follow them with the eye. It has always been
fed with eggs and fle&s;h; but it touches not meat
till it has become putrid. It never inclined to
eat honey; and, being deprived of victuals for
three days, it died, after having taken a &s;mall
quantity of honey. The &s;kin of this animal is
very precious. The furs of the ermine are finer
and fairer than tho&s;e of the white rabbit; but
they &s;oon turn yellowi&s;h; and, indeed, the er|mines
of our climate have always a &s;light tincture
of yellow.</P>
<P>This animal is very frequent in the north, e|&s;pecially
in Ru&s;&s;ia, Norway, and Lapland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 178.</NOTE>, where,
<PB N="264" REF="324">
as in every other place, they are reddi&s;h in &s;um|mer
and white in winter. They feed upon &s;mall
animals, and particularly a &s;pecies of rat, which
abounds in Norway and Lapland, to be after|wards
mentioned. The ermines are rare in tem|perate
climates, and are never found in warm
countries. The Cape animal, called the <HI>ermine</HI>
by Kolbe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne-e&s;perance, p. 54.</NOTE>, and who&s;e fle&s;h, he remarks, is
whole&s;ome and agreeable to the palate, has no
affinity to the ermine. The wea&s;els of Cayenne,
de&s;cribed by M. Barrere<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. de la France equinoctiale.</NOTE>, and the gray ermines
of Tartary, and of the northern parts of China,
mentioned by &s;ome travellers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 565.&mdash;603.</NOTE>, are al&s;o animals
different from our wea&s;els and ermines.</P>

<P>In the natural hi&s;tory of Norway by Pontop|pidan,
we have the following remarks.</P>
<P>'In Norway, the ermine lives among the frag|ments
of rocks. This animal &s;eems to belong
to the wea&s;el tribe. His &s;kin is white, except
the tail, which is &s;potted with black. The furs
of Norway and Lapland pre&s;erve their white|ne&s;s
better than tho&s;e of Ru&s;&s;ia, which &s;ooner
turn yellowi&s;h; and, for this rea&s;on, the for|mer
are of greater reque&s;t, even at Peter&s;burg.

particularly fond of eggs, and, when the &s;ea is

when the female brings forth on an i&s;land, &s;he

<P>THE &s;quirrel is a little neat animal, and may
be con&s;idered as in a &s;tate between &s;avage
and dome&s;tic. The gentlene&s;s, docility, and
inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of his manners, entitle him to re|gard
and protection. Though he &s;ometimes
&s;eizes birds, he is neither carnivorous nor de&s;truc|tive.
Fruits, almonds, nuts, beech-ma&s;t, and a|corns,
are his common food. He is hand&s;ome,
lively, alert, and extremely vigilant and indu|&s;trious.
He has eyes full of fire, a fine counte|nance,
a nervous body, and very nimble limbs.
The beauty of his figure is heightened by a tail
<PB N="269" REF="332">
re&s;embling a plume of feathers, which he
rai&s;es the length of his head, and under which
he &s;hades him&s;elf from the &s;un and weather.
The under part of his body is furni&s;hed with an
apparatus equally remarkable, and which indi|cates
&s;trong generative powers. The &s;quirrel
partakes le&s;s of the nature of quadrupeds than
mo&s;t others of that tribe. He generally re&s;ts
almo&s;t on end, and u&s;es his fore-feet like hands,
in carrying his food to his mouth. In&s;tead of
concealing him&s;elf under the earth, he is perpe|tually
in the air. He approaches the birds by
his lightne&s;s; and, like the feathered tribes, he
dwells on the tops of trees, and traver&s;es the fore&s;ts
by leaping from one tree to another. He like|wi&s;e
builds his ne&s;t in the trees, gathers grains
and &s;eeds, drinks the dews, and de&s;cends not to the
earth, but when the trees are agitated by &s;torms.
He is never found in the open fields, nor in the
plains. He approaches not the habitations of
men, and never remains among bru&s;hwood; but
delights in the lofty trees of the fore&s;t. Of wa|ter
he is &s;till more afraid than of the earth; and
we are a&s;&s;ured, that, when he wants to pa&s;s a ri|ver
or lake, he employs the bark of a tree for a
&s;hip, and u&s;es his tail for the rudder and &s;ails<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rei veritate nititur quod Ge&s;nerus ex Vincentio Beluan|cen&s;i et Olao Magno refert, &s;ciuros, quando aquam tran&s;ire cupiunt, lignum levi&s;&s;imum aquae imponere; eique in&s;identes, et cauda, non tamen ut vult, erecta, &s;ed continuo mota, velifi|cantes neque flante vento, &s;ed tranquillo aequore tran&s;vehi, quod fide dignus, fidu&s;que meus emi&s;&s;arius ad in&s;ulas Goth|landiae, plus &s;implici vice ob&s;ervavit, et cum &s;poliis in littori|bus ibidem collectis redux mirabundus mihi retulit; <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. de Sciuro volante.

and, if the foot of the tree where he repo&s;es be
touched, he in&s;tantly leaves his little ne&s;t, and
flies to another tree, or &s;helters him&s;elf under a
branch. He collects nuts during &s;ummer, hides
them in the trunks or hollows of old trees, and
has recour&s;e to them for his winter food: He like|wi&s;e

of the &s;un; for, during the day, they remain in
their ne&s;ts, from which they i&s;&s;ue, in the night,
to eat, to frolick, and to make love. Their habita|tion
is clean, warm, impenetrable to rain, and
generally &s;ituated in the cleft of a tree. They
begin the work by carrying &s;mall &s;ticks,
<PB N="271" REF="334">
which they mix and interlace with mo&s;s: They
then pre&s;s and &s;tamp it, to give it firmne&s;s and
capacity for holding them&s;elves and their young.
Only a &s;mall &s;trait aperture is left near the top,
hardly &s;ufficient to allow them to pa&s;s. Above
this aperture is a conical cover which &s;helters the
whole, and makes the rain run off the &s;ides.
They generally produce three or four at a litter:
The females come in &s;ea&s;on in the &s;pring, and
bring forth in May, or the beginning of June.
They ca&s;t their hair in winter, and the new fur
is redder than the former. They comb and
dre&s;s them&s;elves with their hands and teeth, are
very cleanly, and have no bad &s;mell. Their
fle&s;h makes pretty good eating. The hair of
their tail is u&s;ed for pencils; but their &s;kin is
only an indifferent fur.</P>

<P>Squirrels &s;hould be con&s;idered rather as na|tives
of northern regions, than of temperate cli|mates;
for they abound &s;o much in Siberia, that
immen&s;e numbers of their &s;kins are annually &s;old
in that country. The Siberians, &s;ays M. Gmelin,
take the &s;quirrels in traps, made nearly in the

<P>It was formerly remarked, that there are black
&s;quirrels in America. M. Aubry, curate of Saint-Louis,
has, in his cabinet, a &s;quirrel, &s;ent him
from Martinico, which is totally black. It is al&s;o
<PB N="273" REF="336">
di&s;tingui&s;hed from other &s;quirrels by having no
hair, or at lea&s;t a very &s;mall quantity, on its ears.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, King's phy&s;ician at Cayenne,
remarks, that, in Guiana, there is only one &s;pe|cies
of &s;quirrel, which lives in the woods; that
its hair is reddi&s;h; that it exceeds not the &s;ize of
an European rat; that it feeds on the grain of
the <HI>Maripa, Aoura, Comana,</HI> &amp;c.; that it brings
forth its young to the number of two, in the
holes of trees; that it bites like a rat; that it is
ea&s;ily tamed; that it makes a kind of low whi&s;|tling
cry; and that it is always &s;een alone, leap|ing
from branch to branch.</P>
<P>I am not certain that this animal, mentioned
by M. de la Borde, is a real &s;quirrel; for the&s;e
animals, in general, are not found in very warm
climates, &s;uch as that of Guiana. The &s;pecies,
on the contrary, is very numerous in the cold
and temperate regions of both Continents.</P>
<P>'We find,' &s;ays M. Kalm, '&s;everal &s;pecies of
&s;quirrels in Pen&s;ylvania, where the &s;mall kind,
called the <HI>ground-&s;quirrel,</HI> is preferred; be|cau&s;e,
though difficult to tame, it is mo&s;t hand|&s;ome.
The large &s;quirrels do much mi&s;chief
to the plantations of maize. They cut the
&s;tems, in order to eat the pith. They &s;ome|times
come in hundreds into a field, and often
devour the whole wheat in a &s;ingle night. In
order to de&s;troy them, a price is put upon their
heads. The inhabitants eat the fle&s;h of the
&s;quirrels, but put little value on their &s;kins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 245.</NOTE>.

<P>NATURE, by de&s;cending gradually from
great to &s;mall, from &s;trong to weak, coun|terbalances
every part of her works. Attentive
&s;olely to the pre&s;ervation of each &s;pecies, &s;he
creates a profu&s;ion of individuals, and &s;upports
by numbers the &s;mall and the feeble, whom &s;he
hath left unprovided with arms or with courage.
She has not only put tho&s;e inferior animals in a
condition to perpetuate and to re&s;i&s;t by their own
numbers, but &s;he &s;eems, at the &s;ame time, to
have afforded a &s;upply to each by multiplying
the neighbouring &s;pecies. The rat, the mou&s;e,
the field-mou&s;e, the water-rat, the &s;hort tailed
<PB N="276" REF="340">
field mou&s;e, the fat &s;quirrel, the garden &s;quirrel,
the dormou&s;e, the &s;hrew-mou&s;e, and &s;everal o|thers,
whom I mention not, becau&s;e they belong
not to our climate, form &s;o many di&s;tinct and
&s;eparate &s;pecies, but &s;o analogous to each other,
that, if any one &s;hould happen to fail, the gap
in the genus would hardly be perceptible. It is
this great number of neighbouring &s;pecies which
hath given to naturali&s;ts the idea of genera; an
idea which can only be employed when we view
objects in general, but which vani&s;hes whenever
we con&s;ider nature in detail.</P>
<P>Men at fir&s;t gave di&s;tinct names to objects which
appeared to differ from each other; and, at the
&s;ame time, they gave general denominations to
objects that &s;eemed to be nearly &s;imilar. A|mong
a rude people, and in the infancy of all lan|guages,
there is hardly any thing but general
terms, or vague and ill-formed expre&s;&s;ions for
objects of the &s;ame order, though very different
from each other. An oak, a beech, a linden-tree,
a fir, a pine, a yew, would, at fir&s;t, have
no other name but that of <HI>a tree</HI>; afterwards the
oak, the beech, and the yew, would all be called
<HI>oak</HI>; when the&s;e were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the fir,
the pine, and the yew, the three latter would be
called <HI>fir.</HI> Particular names could only be in|vented
in con&s;equence of a minute examination
of each different &s;pecies; and the numbers of
the&s;e names are augmented in proportion to the
extent of our knowledge of Nature: The more
<PB N="277" REF="341">
we examine her, proper and particular names
will become more frequent. When natural ob|jects,
therefore, are repre&s;ented to us, under ge|neral
denominations, or by cla&s;&s;es and genera, it
is recalling the darkne&s;s peculiar to the infant
&s;tate of human knowledge. Ignorance is the
parent of genera; but &s;cience will for ever con|tinue
to create and to multiply proper names;
and I &s;hall never he&s;itate in adding to their num|ber,
as often as I have occa&s;ion to delineate dif|ferent
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>Several &s;pecies of &s;mall animals have been
confounded under the generic name of <HI>Rat</HI>: But
we &s;hall confine this name &s;olely to the com|mon
rat, which is of a blacki&s;h colour, and in|fe&s;ts
the habitations of men. The rat common|ly
frequents granaries and barns, and from
thence, when food is &s;carce, comes into our
hou&s;es. He is a carnivorous, or rather an om|nivorous
animal: He &s;eems only to prefer hard
&s;ub&s;tances to tho&s;e which are tender or &s;ucculent.
He gnaws linen, cloaths, furniture, makes holes
in the walls, lodges in the ceilings, and in the
void &s;paces between the wall and the wain&s;cot|ting.
From the&s;e lurking places the rats i&s;&s;ue in
que&s;t of food, and tran&s;port thither every &s;ub|&s;tance
they can drag, forming con&s;iderable ma|gazines,
e&s;pecially when they have young to
provide for. The female brings forth &s;everal
times a year, but always in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on.
The litter generally con&s;i&s;ts of five or &s;ix. They
<PB N="278" REF="342">
are fond of warmth, and, in winter, in&s;inuate
them&s;elves near the chimneys, or lodge among
hay or &s;traw: In &s;pite of cats, poi&s;on, and &s;nares,
the&s;e animals multiply &s;o greatly, that they of|ten
do much damage. In old country-hou&s;es
where grain is kept, and where the vicinity of
barns and magazines of hay facilitates their re|treat,
they often increa&s;e &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, that
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are obliged to remove and de&s;ert
their habitations, unle&s;s the rats happen to de|&s;troy
each other. It is well known, that rats,
when pinched for food, eat one another. When
a famine is created by too great a number being
crouded into one place, the &s;trong kill the weak,
open their heads, and fir&s;t eat the brain, and then
the re&s;t of the body. Next day, the war is re|newed,
and continues in the &s;ame manner till
mo&s;t of them are de&s;troyed. This is the rea&s;on
why the&s;e animals, after being extremely trouble|&s;ome,
di&s;appear all of a &s;udden, and return not
for a long time. The &s;ame thing happens to
field-mice, who&s;e prodigious multiplication is in|terrupted
only by the ho&s;tilities they exerci&s;e on
each other, when provi&s;ions become &s;carce. This
&s;udden de&s;truction is a&s;cribed by Ari&s;totle to the
operation of rains. But rats are not expo&s;ed to
rain, and the field-mice know how to guard
them&s;elves again&s;t its effects; for the holes they
inhabit are not even moi&s;t.</P>
<P>The rats are as la&s;civious as they are voraci|ous:
They &s;queak during their amours, and cry
<PB N="279" REF="343">
when they fight. They prepare a bed for their
young, and &s;oon learn them to eat. When the
young begin to i&s;&s;ue from their hole, the mo|ther
watches, defends, and even fights with the
cats, in order to &s;ave them. A large rat is more
mi&s;chievous, and nearly as &s;trong as a young
cat. The fore-teeth of the rat are long and
&s;trong: The cat is not a good biter; and, as &s;he
u&s;es only her claws, &s;he requires both to be vi|gorous
and accu&s;tomed to fight. The wea&s;el,
though &s;maller, is a more dangerous and formi|dable
enemy, becau&s;e he follows the rat into his
hole. Their &s;trength being nearly equal, the
combat often continues long: But the method of
u&s;ing their arms is very different. The rat wounds
only by reiterated &s;trokes with his fore-teeth,
which are rather de&s;tined for gnawing than bi|ting;
and, being &s;ituated at the extremity of the
lever, or jaw, they have not much force. But
the wea&s;el bites cruelly with the whole jaw, and,
in&s;tead of letting go his hold, he &s;ucks the blood
from the wounded part; and, therefore, the rat
uniformly falls a &s;acrifice to the wea&s;el.</P>
<P>Of this &s;pecies, as in all tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t of
numerous individuals, there are many varieties.
Be&s;ide the common rat, which is blacki&s;h, &s;ome
are brown, others gray, reddi&s;h, and even totally
white. The white rats have red eyes, like the
white rabbit, the white mou&s;e, and all the other a|nimals
which are perfectly white. The whole &s;pe|cies,
and its varieties, appear to be natives of the
<PB N="280" REF="344">
temperate climates, and are more diffu&s;ed over
the warm than the cold regions. There were no
rats originally in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See la de&s;cript. des Antilles par le P. du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 303. L'hi&s;t. nat. des Antilles, p. 261. Nouveaux voyages aux iles de l'Amerique, tom. 3. p. 160. Dampier, tom. 4. p. 225.</P></NOTE>; but tho&s;e imported
from Europe multiplied &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, that they
were long the &s;courge of the colonies, where they
had no enemies but large &s;erpents, who &s;wallow|ed
them alive. They have been carried by &s;hips

multiplied beyond Sweden; for what are

<P>Pontoppidan remarks, 'that neither the wood
nor water rats can live farther north than Nor|way;
that there are &s;everal di&s;tricts, as that of
Hordenver in the dioce&s;e of Bergen, and others
in the dioce&s;e of Aggerhum, where no rats are
to be found; and that the rats on the &s;outh

<P>THE Mou&s;e is much &s;maller, equally nume|rous,
and more generally diffu&s;ed than the
rat. It has the &s;ame in&s;tinct, the &s;ame con&s;titu|tion
and natural di&s;po&s;itions, and differs only by
its weakne&s;s, and the habits which re&s;ult from this
circum&s;tance. Timid by nature, and familiar
from nece&s;&s;ity, fear and want are the &s;ources of
all its movements. He never i&s;&s;ues from his hole
but in que&s;t of food, and runs in again upon the
lea&s;t alarm. He goes not, like the rat, from
hou&s;e to hou&s;e, unle&s;s he be forced, and is not
near &s;o de&s;tructive. His manners are gentle, and
he may be tamed to a certain degree; but he ne|ver
<PB N="283" REF="347">
di&s;covers the &s;malle&s;t attachment to his bene|factors.
It is not, indeed, ea&s;y to love tho&s;e who
are perpetually laying &s;nares for us. Though
weak, the mou&s;e has many enemies, from whom
he has no means of e&s;cape, but tho&s;e of agility
and minutene&s;s. Owls, birds of prey, cats, wea|&s;els,
and even rats, make war upon the mice.
They are &s;hot, caught in traps, and de&s;troyed
by millions. In a word, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by their a|mazing
fecundity alone.</P>
<P>They bring forth at all &s;ea&s;ons, and &s;everal
times in the year. The litter generally con&s;i&s;ts
of five or &s;ix. In le&s;s than fifteen days, the
young are &s;trong enough to di&s;per&s;e, and to pro|cure
food for them&s;elves. The duration of life
in tho&s;e &s;mall animals mu&s;t, therefore, be &s;hort,
&s;ince their growth is &s;o rapid; and this circum|&s;tance
&s;till farther augments the idea of their pro|digious
multiplication. Ari&s;totle tells us, that,
having &s;hut up a pregnant mou&s;e in a ve&s;&s;el, a|long
with plenty of grain, he, in a &s;hort time af|ter,
found 120 mice, all &s;prung from the &s;ame
mother.</P>
<P>The&s;e little animals are by no means ugly;
they have a vivacious and elegant air. That &s;pe|cies
of horror &s;ome people feel at them, ari&s;es
from the &s;urpri&s;e and inconveniencies they &s;ome|times
occa&s;ion. All mice are whiti&s;h under the
belly, and &s;ome are altogether white. Others are
more or le&s;s brown and black. The &s;pecies is
generally diffu&s;ed over Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa;
<PB N="284" REF="348">
and, it is alledged, that tho&s;e of America, where
they are very numerous, came originally from the
Old Continent. It is, however, certain, that this
little animal follows man, and flies from uninha|bited
places, probably on account of its natural
appetite for bread, chee&s;e, butter, oil, and other
aliment which men prepare for them&s;elves.</P>

<P>White mice, with red eyes, are found not only
in our temperate climates, but in the &s;outhern

mice, with red eyes,' &s;ays Pontoppidan, 'have

but, whether they are indigenous, or

<P>THIS animal is le&s;s than the rat, and larger
than the mou&s;e. It never lives in hou&s;es,
but is found in the fields and woods. Its eyes are
remarkably large and prominent; and it differs
&s;till more from the rat and mou&s;e, by the colour
of its hair, which is whiti&s;h under the belly, and
of a reddi&s;h brown on the back. It is very gene|rally
and copiou&s;ly diffu&s;ed, e&s;pecially in elevated
countries. It &s;eems to take a con&s;iderable time in
arriving at full growth, becau&s;e it varies greatly
in &s;ize. The large&s;t are between four and five
inches long; and the &s;maller ones, which appear
likewi&s;e to be adults, are an inch &s;horter. And,
as we find them of all intermediate &s;izes, both the
<PB N="286" REF="350">
great and &s;mall are unque&s;tionably the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.
Ignorance of this fact has, probably, led
&s;ome naturali&s;ts to make two &s;pecies of them, the
one called <HI>the great field-rat,</HI> and the other <HI>the
field-mou&s;e.</HI> Ray, who fir&s;t fell into this blunder,
&s;eems to acknowledge that he knew but one
&s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De hac &s;pecie mihi non undequaque &s;atisfactum e&s;t; <HI>Ray, &s;ynop&s;. quad. p.</HI> 219.</NOTE>. And, though the &s;hort de&s;criptions he
has given each &s;pecies appear to differ, we ought not
to conclude that both exi&s;t: 1. Becau&s;e he him|&s;elf
knew but one; 2. Becau&s;e, after all the re|&s;earches
I have made, I have not been able to di&s;|cover
more than one kind; becau&s;e Ge&s;ner, and
other naturali&s;ts, mention only one &s;pecies, under
the name of <HI>mus agre&s;tis major,</HI> which they &s;ay
is very common; and becau&s;e Ray &s;ays that the
other kind, called <HI>mus dome&s;ticus medius,</HI> is al&s;o
very common: Hence, it is apparent, that none
of the&s;e authors have ever &s;een both kinds, &s;ince
they acknowledge both to be very common; 4.
Becau&s;e, in this &s;ingle &s;pecies, individuals are
found of a larger and le&s;&s;er &s;ize, this circum&s;tance
might lead them to con&s;ider the &s;mall as of one
&s;pecies, and the large of another; La&s;tly, becau&s;e
the de&s;criptions are too vague and inaccurate to
e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;pecific difference.</P>
<P>The antients, indeed, mention two &s;pecies, the
one under the denomination of <HI>mus agre&s;tis ma|jor,</HI>
the other under that of <HI>mus agre&s;tis minor.</HI>
The&s;e two &s;pecies are very common, and we know
<PB N="287" REF="351">
them as well as the antients: The fir&s;t is our long|tailed
field-mou&s;e; the &s;econd is not the <HI>mus do|me&s;ticus
medius</HI> of Ray, but another animal,
known by the name of the <HI>&s;hort-tailed field-mou&s;e,</HI>
or <HI>little field-rat.</HI> And, as it differs both from
the rat and the long-tailed field-mou&s;e, I have
given it its Italian name, <HI>compagnoli</HI> or <HI>compag|nol.</HI></P>
<P>The long-tailed field-mou&s;e, as I formerly re|maked,
lives in dry and elevated grounds. In
the woods and adjacent fields, they are found in
va&s;t numbers. They retire into holes among the
bru&s;hwood and under the trunks of trees, where
they ama&s;s great quantities of acorns, nuts, and
beech-ma&s;t; &s;ometimes a whole bu&s;hel is found
in a &s;ingle hole; and this hoard is not propor|tioned
to the wants of the animal, but to the ca|pacity
of the place where it is depo&s;ited. The&s;e
holes are generally more than a foot under ground,
and often divided into two apartments, the one
for living in along with their young, and the o|ther
for a magazine. I have frequently &s;een great
damage done to the plantations by the&s;e animals.
They carry off the new &s;own acorns; by follow|ing
the furrow of the plough, they dig up one
after another, not leaving a &s;ngle &s;eed. This
happens chiefly in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when the acorns
are &s;carce: Not finding enough in the woods,
they come in que&s;t of them in the cultivated fields,
and do not eat them on the &s;pot, but tran&s;port
them to their holes, where they ama&s;s &s;uch quan|tities,
<PB N="288" REF="352">
tities, that they often corrupt. The&s;e creatures
alone do more mi&s;chief in a nur&s;ery of trees than
all the birds and other animals put together. The
only way to prevent this damage is, to lay traps at
ten paces a&s;under through the extent of the &s;own
ground. No other apparatus is nece&s;&s;ary than a
roa&s;ted walnut placed under a flat &s;tone, &s;upport|ed
by a &s;tick. The animals come to eat the wal|nut,
which they prefer to acorns; and, as the
walnut is fixed to the &s;tick, whenever they touch
it, the &s;tone falls and cru&s;hes them to death. I
have u&s;ed the &s;ame expedient for the de&s;truction
of the &s;hort-tailed field-mou&s;e, who likewi&s;e de|&s;troy
acorns. When I began this operation, I
de&s;ired all the mice that were caught by the traps
to be brought to me, and found, with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
that above 100 were taken each day, from
a piece of ground con&s;i&s;ting only of about 40
French arpents. From the 15th of November to
the 8th of December, above 2000 were &s;lain in
this manner. Their numbers gradually decrea&s;ed
till the fro&s;t became &s;evere, when they retire to
their holes, and feed upon the magazines they
have collected. It is more than 20 years &s;ince I
made this trial, which I always repeated when I
&s;owed tree-&s;eeds, and never failed to catch va&s;t
quantities of the&s;e mice. They abound chiefly
in autumn, their numbers being much le&s;s in the
&s;pring: For, if provi&s;ions fail during the winter,
the &s;trong devour the weak. The long-tailed
field mice likewi&s;e eat the &s;hort-tailed &s;pecies, and
<PB N="289" REF="353">
even thru&s;hes, blackbirds, and other birds which
they find entangled in &s;nares. They fir&s;t eat the
brain, and then the re&s;t of the body. I once
kept a dozen of the&s;e mice in a cage, and furni&s;h|ed
them with food every morning at eight o'clock.
One day they were neglected for about a quar|ter
of an hour, when one of their number was
eaten up by the re&s;t; next day another fuffered
the &s;ame fate; and, in a few days, only one re|mained:
All the others had been killed, and part|ly
devoured; and even the &s;urvivor him&s;elf had
his feet and tail mutilated.</P>
<P>The rat is very prolific; but the long-tailed
field-mou&s;e is more &s;o. The latter brings forth
more than once a year, and the litters often con|&s;i&s;t
of nine or ten, while tho&s;e of the rat never
exceed five or &s;ix. In one hole I have found two
mothers and twenty young. This animal is very
generally diffu&s;ed over Europe. It is found in
Sweden, and is called by Linnaeus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faun. Suec. p. 11.</NOTE> <HI>mus cauda
longa, corpore nigro &s;lave&s;cente, abdomine albo.</HI> It
is very common in France, Italy, and Switzer|land:

<P>THIS animal is about the &s;ize of a rat; but,
from its manners and di&s;po&s;itions, has a
much greater re&s;emblance to the otter than to
the common rat. Like the otter, it frequents
the fre&s;h water, and is found on the margins of
rivers, brooks, and pools, and lives mo&s;tly on
fi&s;hes. Gudgeons, minnows, blays, and the fry
of carps, pikes, and barbels, are its ordinary food.
<PB N="291" REF="355">
He likewi&s;e eats frogs, water-in&s;ects, and &s;ome|times
the roots of plants. He has not, like the
otter, membranes between his toes. This error
has been copied from Willoughby by Ray and
other naturali&s;ts. Though all his toes be &s;e|parate,
he &s;wims with ea&s;e, keeps long under
the water, and carries off his prey to be devour|ed
upon the gra&s;s, or in his hole. He is &s;ome|times
&s;urpri&s;ed by fi&s;hers when &s;earching for
craw-fi&s;h; and he endeavours to e&s;cape by biting
their fingers, or leaping into the water. His
head is &s;horter, his muzzle thicker, his hair more
bu&s;hy, and his tail much &s;horter, than tho&s;e of
the rat. Like the otter, he avoids large rivers,
or rather tho&s;e which are much frequented. He
never vi&s;its hou&s;es or barns, but keeps upon the
margins of waters, from which he wanders not
upon dry land &s;o far as the otter, who is &s;ome|times
found at the di&s;tance of a league from wa|ter.
Water-rats are &s;eldom met with in elevated
places, or in dry plains, but are extremely nu|merous
in moi&s;t and mar&s;hy vallies. The fe|males
come in &s;ea&s;on about the end of winter,
and bring forth in the month of April, the litter
generally con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix or &s;even. Perhaps
they bring forth more than once a year; but of
this we have no proper knowledge. Their fle&s;h
is not intollerably bad, being eaten by the pea|&s;ants,
as well as the otter, during the &s;ea&s;on of
lent. They are found every where over Europe,
<PB N="292" REF="356">
excepting in the polar regions. If we may cre|dit
Bellon, they inhabit the banks of the Nile:
However, the figure he gives of them has &s;o lit|tle
re&s;emblance to our water-rat, that it is proba|ble
the Nile rats form a different &s;pecies of ani|mals.</P>

<P>THE Short-tailed Field-mou&s;e is &s;till more
common and more generally diffu&s;ed than
the long-tailed kind. The latter never appears
in high grounds; but the former is found every
where, in the woods, the fields, the meadows,
and even in the gardens. It is remarkable for
the thickne&s;s of its head, and the &s;hortne&s;s of its
tail, which exceeds not an inch in length. It
digs holes in the earth, where it ama&s;&s;es grain,
filberts, and acorns: But it appears to prefer corn
to every other food. In the month of July,
when the grain is ripe, the &s;hort-tailed field-mice
a&s;&s;emble from all quarters, and often do great da|mage
<PB N="294" REF="360">
by cutting the &s;talks of the corn, in order
to come at the ears. They follow the reapers,
and eat up all the fallen or neglected grain.
When the gleanings are devoured, they flock
to the new-&s;own fields, and prematurely de|&s;troy
the crop of the en&s;uing year. In winter,
mo&s;t of them retire into the woods, where they
feed upon filberts, acorns, and the &s;eeds of trees.
In particular years, they appear in numbers &s;o
immen&s;e, that they would de&s;troy every thing,
if they continued long: But they always kill and
eat one another during a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions.
They, be&s;ides, become the prey of the long-tailed
field-mou&s;e, the fox, the wild cat, and the wea|&s;els.</P>
<P>In its internal &s;tructure, this animal re&s;embles
the water-rat more than any other; but differs
from him externally by &s;everal e&s;&s;ential charac|ters:
1. By the &s;ize; the &s;hort-tailed field mou&s;e
is not above three inches long; but the water|rat
is &s;even inches: 2. By the dimen&s;ions of the
head and body, tho&s;e of the former being pro|portionally
thicker than tho&s;e of the latter: 3. By
the length of the tail, which, in this field-mou&s;e,
exceeds not a third of the length of the animal's
body; but the length of the tail of the water-rat
is near two thirds of its body: La&s;tly, By its
manners and di&s;po&s;itions: It feeds not upon fi&s;h|es,
nor goes into water, but nouri&s;hes it&s;elf with
acorns, corn, and tuberous roots, &s;uch as tho&s;e of
the dandelion, &amp;c. Their holes re&s;emble tho&s;e

<P>THIS little animal, though a native of Bra|&s;il
and of Guiney, lives and propagates in
the temperate, and even in the cold climates,
when protected from the inclemency of the &s;ea|&s;ons.
Though they multiply prodigiou&s;ly in
France, their numbers are never great; becau&s;e
the care they require is not compen&s;ated by the
profits ari&s;ing from them. Their &s;kin is hardly
of any value, and their fle&s;h, though eatable, is
<PB N="297" REF="364">
not &s;o good as to be much demanded; but, it
might be improved, by keeping them in warrens,
where they would have the benefit of fre&s;h air,
and the liberty of choo&s;ing herbs agreeable to
their ta&s;te. Tho&s;e kept in hou&s;es have nearly
the &s;ame bad ta&s;te with warren-rabbits; and
tho&s;e kept in gardens during &s;ummer, have an
in&s;ipid, but le&s;s di&s;agreeable &s;avour.</P>
<P>The temperament of the&s;e animals is &s;o hot
and premature, that they copulate five or &s;ix
weeks after their birth. They acquire not, how|ever,
their full growth before the 8th or 9th
month. But this increa&s;e of &s;ize con&s;i&s;ts only of
fat; for the &s;olid parts are fully unfolded before the
age of &s;ix months. The females go with young
only three weeks; and I have known them bring
forth at the age of two months. The fir&s;t litter
con&s;i&s;ts of four or five; the &s;econd of five or &s;ix;
and the &s;ucceeding ones of &s;even or eight, and
&s;ometimes of ten or twelve. The mother &s;uckles
her young twelve or fifteen days; &s;he bani&s;hes
them as &s;oon as &s;he receives the male, which
happens, at farthe&s;t, three weeks after her deli|very;
and, if any of them per&s;i&s;t in following
her, they are maletreated and &s;lain by the father.
Thus the&s;e animals produce at lea&s;t every two
months; and, as their young bring forth in the
&s;ame &s;pace, we are a&s;toni&s;hed at their rapid and
numerous multiplication. From a &s;ingle couple
we may have 1000 in one year. But their
de&s;truction is as rapid as their propagation. They
<PB N="230" REF="365">
are killed by cold and by moi&s;ture; they allow
them&s;elves, without re&s;i&s;tance, to be eaten by the
cats; even the mothers defend not their young
from their de&s;troyers; not having time to form
an attachment to their young, they make no ef|forts
to &s;ave them. The males are &s;till le&s;s &s;olli|citous
about their offspring, and even allow them|&s;elves
to be devoured, without re&s;i&s;tance. They
&s;eem to have no di&s;tinct &s;entiment, but that of
love. When under the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion,
they are &s;u&s;ceptible of anger, fight cruelly, and e|ven
kill each other in di&s;puting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
a female. They pa&s;s their lives in &s;leeping, eat|ing,
and amours. Their &s;leep is &s;hort, but fre|quent;
they eat every hour, both day and night;
and they indulge in mutual embraces as often as
they eat. Though perpetually throwing out
urine, they never drink. They feed on all kinds
of herbs, but e&s;pecially on par&s;ley, which they
prefer to grain or to bread. They are likewi&s;e
fond of apples and other fruits. They eat preci|pitantly,
like the rabbit, little at a time, but very
often. They make a kind of grunting noi&s;e, &s;i|milar
to that of a young pig. A kind of chirp|ing
noi&s;e marks the time of their amours, and
they rai&s;e a &s;harp cry when they feel pain. They
are extremely delicate, and &s;o impatient of cold,
that it is difficult to pre&s;erve them through the
winter. They mu&s;t be kept in a dry, warm,
whole&s;ome place. When they feel cold, they a&s;|&s;emble

<P><GAP DESC="foreign"> 'That the fox
knows many things, and the hedge-hog but
one important thing,' is a proverbial &s;aying
of the antients<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zenodotus, Plutarchus, et alii ex Archilocho.</NOTE>. The latter knows how to de|fend
him&s;elf without fighting, and to wound
without making an attack. Having little &s;trength,
and le&s;s agility for flight, he has received from
<PB N="301" REF="369">
Nature a &s;pinous armour, with the faculty of rol|ling
him&s;elf up like a ball, and of pre&s;enting on
all &s;ides tho&s;e &s;harp weapons, which repel the e|nemy.
The more he is hara&s;&s;ed, he rolls him|&s;elf
up the clo&s;er. His fears tend &s;till farther to
defend him; for, by throwing out his urine, the
&s;mell and humidity of which &s;preads over his
whole body, he completely di&s;gu&s;ts the enemy.
Thus mo&s;t dogs content them&s;elves with barking,
and never choo&s;e to &s;eize the hedge-hog. The
fox, however, accompli&s;hes his end, by wounding
the animal's feet, and making the blood run into
its mouth. But the hedge-hog is proof again&s;t the
wea&s;el, the martin, the polecat, the ferret, and birds
of prey. From the head to the tail, both male
and female are equally covered with &s;pines, and
only the under parts of their bodies are garni&s;h|ed
with hair. But tho&s;e arms, which are &s;o u&s;eful
to them in defending again&s;t enemies, become
exceeding inconvenient when they want to u|nite.
They cannot copulate in the manner of
other quadrupeds, but face to face, either on end,
or lying. The females come in &s;ea&s;on in the
&s;pring, and bring forth in the beginning of &s;um|mer.
I have frequently had the mother and her
young brought to me in the month of June. The
litter generally con&s;i&s;ts of three or four, and &s;ome|times
of five. When very young, they are white,
and the buds of the &s;pines are only vi&s;ible through
the &s;kin. I tried to rear &s;ome of them, by put|ting
the mother and her young in a barrel, with,
<PB N="302" REF="370">
plenty of provi&s;ions: But, in place of &s;uckling,
&s;he devoured them one after another. This was
not the effect of hunger; for &s;he eat bread, meat,
and fruits. One would never have imagined that
an animal &s;o &s;low and indolent, could be &s;o im|patient
of confinement. It even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the
&s;ame &s;pecies of malevolence with that of the mon|key.
A hedge-hog that had &s;lipped into the
kitchen, took the meat out of a &s;mall kettle, and
defiled it with his ordure. I kept males and fe|males
in a room together; but, though they li|ved,
they never coupled. I left &s;everal of them
in my gardens, where they did &s;o little mi&s;chief,
that it could hardly be perceived. They live up|on
fallen fruits; and dig the earth to a &s;mall
depth with their no&s;es. They eat may-bugs,
beetles, gra&s;hoppers, worms, and &s;ome roots.
They are likewi&s;e fond of fle&s;h-meat, which they
devour either raw or roa&s;ted. In the country,
they are frequently found in the woods, under
the trunks of old trees, in the cliffs of rocks, and
particularly among the &s;tones collected upon the
fields and vineyards. I am uncertain whether
they climb trees, as &s;ome naturali&s;ts a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Arbores a&s;cendit, poma et pyra decutit, in i&s;tis &s;e&s;e volu|tat ut &s;pinis haereant; <HI>Sperling. Zoologia,</HI> p. 281.</P></NOTE>, or
u&s;e their &s;pines for tran&s;porting fruits or grapes.
They &s;eize with the mouth every thing they eat;
and, though they abound in our fore&s;ts, they
have never been di&s;covered upon trees, but are
always found in holes or under the mo&s;s. They
<PB N="303" REF="371">
&s;tir not during the day, but go about the whole
night. They approach not the habitations of
men; but, though they &s;ometimes appear in the
meadows, they prefer dry and elevated grounds.
They are taken by the hand, never fly, nor de|fend
them&s;elves with their feet or their teeth;
but, when touched, they roll up in the form of a
ball, and will not extend them&s;elves, unle&s;s they
be plunged in water. They &s;leep during the
winter; and, therefore, the provi&s;ions they are
&s;aid to ama&s;s in &s;ummer, would be entirely u&s;e|le&s;s
to them. They eat little, and can live long
without food. Their blood is nearly as cold as
that of tho&s;e animals who &s;leep during winter.
Their fle&s;h makes not good eating; and their
&s;kin, of which no u&s;e is now made, was former|ly
employed for heckling hemp.</P>
<P>Some authors mention two &s;pecies of hedge|hog,
one with a &s;nout like a hog, and the o|ther

I know only one &s;pecies, of which there are even

<P>THE Shrew Mou&s;e &s;eems to form a link in
the chain of &s;mall animals, and to fill the
interval between the rat and the mole, which,
though they re&s;emble each other in &s;ize, differ
greatly in figure, and are very di&s;tant &s;pecies.
The &s;hrew is &s;till &s;maller than the mou&s;e, and has
<PB N="306" REF="375">
an affinity to the mole, by its long no&s;e; by its
eyes, which, though larger than tho&s;e of the
mole, are much concealed, and more minute than
tho&s;e of the mou&s;e; by the number of its toes,
having five on each foot; by the tail and legs, e|&s;pecially
the hind-legs, which are &s;horter than
tho&s;e of the mou&s;e; by the ears; and, la&s;tly, by
the teeth. This little animal has a &s;trong and
peculiar odour, which is very di&s;agreeable to the
cats, who pur&s;ue and kill, but never eat the &s;hrews.
It is probably this bad &s;mell, and the reluctance
of the cats, which have given ri&s;e to the vulgar
prejudice, that the bite of the &s;hrew-mou&s;e is ve|nomous,
and particulary hurtful to hor&s;es. But
the &s;hrew is neither venomous, nor is it capable
of biting; for the aperture of its mouth is not
large enough to take in a duplicature of another
animal's &s;kin, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the
action of biting. The di&s;ea&s;e of hor&s;es, vulgarly
a&s;cribed to the bite of the &s;hrew-mou&s;e, is a &s;wel|ling
or blotch, and proceeds from an internal cau&s;e,
which has no relation to a bite. This animal,
e&s;pecially in winter, frequents hay-lofts, &s;tables,
barns, and dung-hills. It feeds upon grain, in|&s;ects,
and putrid fle&s;h. In the country, it fre|quents
the woods, and lives upon grain. It con|ceals
it&s;elf under mo&s;s and the leaves and trunks
of trees, and &s;ometimes in the holes abandoned
by the mole, or in &s;maller holes which it digs
with its muzzle and claws. The &s;hrew produ|ces
an equal number, though not &s;o frequently,
<PB N="307" REF="376">
as the mou&s;e. Its cry is al&s;o much &s;harper; but
it is not near &s;o agile. It is ea&s;ily taken;
becau&s;e it both &s;ees and runs badly. The colour
of the &s;hrew is a mixture of brown and red; but
&s;ome are a&s;h-coloured, and others nearly black,
though all of them are white under the belly.
They are very common in Europe; but they &s;eem

prodigious quantity of &s;eminal fluid, enormous
te&s;ticles, a penis of immoderate length; and
all the&s;e parts are concealed within the body,
which mu&s;t render them more hot and ac|tive.
Of all animals the mole is mo&s;t amply en|dowed
with generative organs, and con&s;equent|ly
with their relative &s;en&s;ations. It has, be&s;ides,
a delicate &s;en&s;e of touch; a &s;kin as &s;oft as vel|vet;
a very fine ear, and &s;mall hands, with five
fingers, very different from the extremities of o|ther
quadrupeds, and nearly &s;imilar to the hu|man
hand; great &s;trength in proportion to the
&s;ize of its body; a compact &s;kin; and a perpetual
vigour. So lively and reciprocal an attachment
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the male and female, that they
&s;eem to dread or to di&s;reli&s;h all other &s;ociety.
They enjoy the placid habits of repo&s;e and of
&s;olitude, the art of &s;ecuring them&s;elves from di&s;|quiet
and injury, of in&s;tantaneou&s;ly making an
a&s;ylum or habitation, of extending its dimen&s;ions,
and of finding a plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, without the
nece&s;&s;ity of going abroad. The&s;e are the man|ners,
the di&s;po&s;itions, and the talents of the mole;
and they are unque&s;tionably preferable to talents
<PB N="311" REF="381">
more brilliant and more incompatible with hap|pine&s;s,
than the mo&s;t profound ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The mole &s;huts up the entrance of her retreat,
and &s;eldom leaves it, unle&s;s compelled by the ad|mi&s;&s;ion
of water, or when its man&s;ion is demo|li&s;hed
by art. She makes a round vault in the
meadows, and generally a long trench in the gar|dens;
becau&s;e it is ea&s;ier to remove cultivated
ground, than a turf rendered compact and &s;olid
by the roots of herbs. She continues not long
in miry nor in hard &s;tony ground, but delights in
a &s;oft earth, &s;tored with e&s;culent roots, and well
peopled with in&s;ects and worms, which con&s;titute
her chief nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>As the moles &s;eldom leave their &s;ubterranean
abodes, they have few enemies, and ea&s;ily elude
the carnivorous animals. The overflowing of
rivers is their greate&s;t &s;courge: During inunda|tions,
they are &s;een &s;wimming in va&s;t numbers, and
u&s;ing every effort to gain the more elevated
grounds; but mo&s;t of them peri&s;h, as well as
their young, who remain in their holes. With|out
this deva&s;tation, the great talents they have
for multiplying would render them extremely
incommodious to man. They couple about the
end of winter, and go but a &s;hort time with young;
for we find them very &s;mall in the month of May.
They generally bring forth four or five at a time;
and it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the hillocks under which
they litter; for they are larger, and made with
more art than the common kind. I believe tho&s;e
<PB N="312" REF="382">
animals bring forth more than once a year; but
of this I cannot be certain: It is a fact, however,
that we meet with young ones from April to Au|gu&s;t.
Perhaps &s;ome of them may be later in
coupling than others.</P>
<P>The habitation where they depo&s;it their young
merits a particular de&s;cription; becau&s;e it is con|&s;tructed
with &s;ingular intelligence. They begin
with rai&s;ing the earth, and forming a pretty high
arch. They leave partitions, or a kind of pillars
at certain di&s;tances, beat and pre&s;s the earth, in|terweave
it with the roots of plants, and render
it &s;o hard and &s;olid, that the water cannot pene|trate
the vault, on account of its convexity and
firmne&s;s. They then elevate a little hillock below,
upon the top of which they lay herbs and leaves,
for a bed to their young. In this &s;ituation, they
are above the level of the ground, and con&s;e|quently
out of the reach of ordinary inundations,
and are, at the &s;ame time, defended from the rains
by the large vault that covers the internal one,
upon the convexity of which they re&s;t, along with
their young. This internal hillock, or vault, is
pierced on all &s;ides with &s;loping holes, which de|&s;cend
&s;till lower, and &s;erve as &s;ubterraneous pa&s;|&s;ages
for the mother to go in que&s;t of food
for her&s;elf and her offspring. The&s;e by-paths
are firm and beaten, extend about twelve or fif|teen
paces, and i&s;&s;ue from the man&s;ion like rays
from a centre. We likewi&s;e find, under the &s;uperior
vault, the remains of the roots of the <HI>colchicum,</HI> or
<PB N="313" REF="383">
meadow &s;affron, which &s;eem to be the fir&s;t food
given to the young. From this de&s;cription it is
apparent, that the mole never comes out but at a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance from her habitation, and
that the mo&s;t &s;imple and mo&s;t certain method of
taking both the old and the young, is to make a
round trench, which will cut off all the commu|nicating
pa&s;&s;ages. But, as the mole, upon the
&s;malle&s;t noi&s;e, flies, and endeavours to carry off
her young, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to employ three
or four men with &s;pades to rai&s;e the hillock at
once, or to make a trench almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly,

<P>I have here given a figure of a mole found at
the Cape of Good Hope, a &s;tuffed &s;kin of
which was &s;ent me by M. Sonnerat. This mole
pretty much re&s;embles the common &s;pecies in the
form of its body, in the eyes, in the ears, and in
the tail; but it differs in the head, which is lar|ger,
and in the muzzle, which re&s;embles that of a
Guiney-pig. The fore-feet are likewi&s;e different:
The hair is not black, but dark brown, with a
little yellow at the extremity of each hair. The
tail is covered with large hairs of a yellowi&s;h
white colour; and, in general, the hair of this
mole is longer than that of the European. From
all the&s;e de&s;criptions we may conclude, that it is
a particular &s;pecies, and that, though allied to the
common mole, it cannot be regarded as a &s;imple

<HEAD>The PENSYLVANIA MOLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN Pen&s;ylvania, &s;ays M. Kalm, there is a &s;pe|cies
of mole, which lives principally on roots.
This animal digs, in the fields, &s;mall winding &s;ub|terraneous
alleys. In proportion to its &s;ize, it
has more &s;trength and rigidity in its paws than
mo&s;t other quadrupeds. In digging the earth, it
u&s;es its feet like oars. M. Kalm put one of them
into his handkerchief; and he found, that, in
le&s;s than a minute, it had made a number of &s;mall
holes, as if the cloth had been pierced with a bod|kin.
It was very mi&s;chievous; and, whenever
it found any objects in its way, it immediately
perforated them with its teeth. I pre&s;ented to it,
continues M. Kalm, my ink-piece, which was
made of &s;teel; it began to bite the ink-piece; but
was &s;oon repelled by the hardne&s;s of the metal,
and never afterwards inclined to bite any thing
that was held out to it. This animal rai&s;es not
the earth, like the moles of Europe, but only
makes &s;mall paths under the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Kalm, tom. 2. p. 333.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THOUGH all beings are equally perfect
in them&s;elves, &s;ince they proceed from the
hands of the &s;ame Creator; yet, in relation to
man, &s;ome beings are more accompli&s;hed, and o|thers
&s;eem to be imperfect or deformed. Of the
former kind are all tho&s;e who&s;e figures appear to
us to be agreeable and complete; becau&s;e all their
parts and members are proportioned, all their
movements and functions ea&s;y and natural. The
latter kind of beings, which to us have a hideous
a&s;pect, comprehends all tho&s;e who&s;e qualities are
noxious to man, who&s;e nature is uncommon, and
who&s;e form differs from the ordinary figures from
<PB N="318" REF="390">
which we received our primary &s;en&s;ations, and
derived tho&s;e ideas which &s;erve as models to our
judgment. The head of a man upon the neck
of a hor&s;e, and its body covered with feathers,
and terminating in the tail of a fi&s;h, repre&s;ents a
picture of enormous deformity, for no other rea|&s;on
but becau&s;e it unites what Nature has placed
at the greate&s;t di&s;tance. An animal, like the bat,
which is half a quadruped and half a bird, and
which, upon the whole, is neither the one nor
the other, mu&s;t be a mon&s;trous being; becau&s;e,
by uniting the attributes of two oppo&s;ite genera,
it re&s;embles none of tho&s;e models pre&s;ented to us
in the great cla&s;&s;es of nature. It is an imperfect
quadruped, and a &s;till more imperfect bird. A
quadruped &s;hould have four feet, and a bat &s;hould
have feathers and wings. In the bat, the fore|feet,
though they &s;erve the animal for the double
purpo&s;e of flying and of trailing its body on the
ground, are neither wings nor feet. They are
deformed extremities, the bones of which are e|normou&s;ly
lengthened, and united by a mem|brane,
which is neither covered with feathers nor
with hair. They are a &s;pecies of pinions, or
winged paws, in which we &s;ee only a claw of
an inch in length; and the other four long toes
mu&s;t act along with the former; for they have
no proper movements or &s;eparate functions.
They are a kind of hands ten times larger than
the feet, and four times longer than the body of
the animal. In fine, they are parts which have
<PB N="319" REF="391">
rather the air of caprice than of a regular pro|duction.
This membrane covers the arm, forms
the wings or hands of the animal, unites with the
&s;kin of the body, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;urrounds
the legs, and even the tail, which, by this bizarre
conjunction, becomes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, one of
its toes. To the&s;e di&s;crepancies and di&s;propor|tions
of the body and its members may be added
the deformities of the head, which are often much
greater: For, in &s;ome &s;pecies, the no&s;e is hardly
vi&s;ible, the eyes are &s;unk near the ear, and con|founded
with the cheeks: In others, the ears are
as long as the body, or the face is twi&s;ted into the
form of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe, and the no&s;e turned up like
a cock's comb. All of them have &s;mall, ob&s;cure,
covered eyes, a no&s;e, or rather no&s;trils, ill|formed,
and a mouth extending from ear to ear:
They all likewi&s;e endeavour to conceal them&s;elves,
fly the light, inhabit dark places only, from
which they never go out but during the night,
return at break of day, and fa&s;ten them&s;elves
again&s;t the walls. Their motion in the air is ra|ther
a de&s;ultory fluttering, than flying, which
they execute very aukwardly. With difficulty
they rai&s;e them&s;elves from the earth, and never
fly to any great height: They quicken, relax,
or direct their flight, in a manner the mo&s;t bung|ling
and imperfect. Their flight is neither rapid
nor direct, but con&s;i&s;ts of quick vibrations, in an
oblique and winding direction. They fail not,
however, in pa&s;&s;ing, to &s;eize flies, gnats, and par|ticularly
<PB N="320" REF="392">
moths, which fly only during the night.
The&s;e they &s;wallow almo&s;t entire; and we find,
in their excrements, portions of wings and other
dry and indige&s;tible parts of moths. Having one
day de&s;cended into the caverns of Arcy, to exa|mine
the &s;talactites, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find, in a
place covered with alaba&s;ter, and &s;o dark and pro|found,
a kind of earth which was totally differ|ent:
It was a thick ma&s;s, &s;everal feet in extent,
of a blacki&s;h matter, almo&s;t entirely compo&s;ed of
fragments of the wings and legs of flies and
moths, as if immen&s;e numbers of the&s;e in&s;ects
had a&s;&s;embled in order to die and corrupt toge|ther.
This, however, was nothing el&s;e but the
dung of bats, probably ama&s;&s;ed during many
years in a favourite part of the&s;e &s;ubterranean
caverns; for, through the whole of the&s;e caverns,
which extend above half a quarter of a league, I
&s;aw no other collection of this matter; and I i|magined
that the bats had fixed upon this place
for their common abode; becau&s;e it was reached
by a glimmering light from an aperture in the
rock, and that they cho&s;e not to go farther, le&s;t
they &s;hould be lo&s;t in a darkne&s;s too profound.</P>
<P>Bats are real quadrupeds: Excepting the fa|culty
of flying, they have nothing in common
with birds. But, as the action of flying implies
great &s;trength in the upper and anterior parts of
the body, the bats have their pectoral mu&s;cles
much &s;tronger and more fle&s;hy than tho&s;e of
quadrupeds; and in this they have an affinity to
<PB N="321" REF="393">
the birds. They differ from them, however, in
every other part of their &s;tructure, both external
and internal: The lungs, the heart, the organs of
generation, and all the other vi&s;cera, are &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of quadrupeds, excepting the penis, which
is pendulous and loo&s;e, a thing peculiar to man,
the monkeys, and the bats. Like the quadru|peds,
the bats are viviparous, and have teeth and
paps. They are &s;aid to bring forth but two at a
time, and that they &s;uckle their young, and even
carry them when flying. In &s;ummer they copu|late
and bring forth; for they are in a torpid
&s;tate during winter. Some cover them&s;elves with
their wings, as with a mantle, and &s;u&s;pend them|&s;elves
by the hind feet to the vaults of &s;ubterrane|ous
caverns; others &s;tick fa&s;t to old walls, or re|tire
into holes. Wherever they take up their
winter abode, they always a&s;&s;emble in &s;uch num|bers
as &s;ecure them again&s;t the effects of cold.
They pa&s;s the winter without food or motion,
never awake till the &s;pring, and again retire at
the end of autumn. They &s;upport hunger bet|ter
than cold: Though carnivorous animals, they
can &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;everal days without food. When
they get into a lardner, they fix upon the &s;u&s;pend|ed
meat, and eat fle&s;h whether raw or roa&s;ted,
fre&s;h or corrupted.</P>
<P>Only two &s;pecies of bats have formerly been
de&s;cribed as natives of our climate. Be&s;ide the&s;e,
M. Daubenton has di&s;covered other &s;ix, which
are equally numerous and common; and it is

to the naturali&s;ts, and is perhaps &s;till more nu|merous
than the common bat. The long-eared
bat is much le&s;s than the common &s;pecies; its
wings are likewi&s;e &s;horter, its muzzle &s;maller

and even more frequent than the two preceding
&s;pecies. This bat is found under the eaves of
hou&s;es, ca&s;tles, and churches, and al&s;o in the hol|lows
of old trees. It is nearly as large as the
common bat. Its ears are broad and &s;hort, its
hair reddi&s;h, and it has a &s;harp piercing voice,

winter; for it is not a &s;tate of natural &s;leep,
but a torpor or numbne&s;s of the &s;en&s;es and mem|bers,
produced by a chillne&s;s of the blood. The
internal heat of the&s;e creatures exceeds not that
of the air. When the heat of the air is ten de|grees
above the freezing point, their temperature
is preci&s;ely the &s;ame. I have plunged the ball
of a thermometer into the bodies of &s;everal living
garden &s;quirrels, and found their internal heat to
be always nearly equal to the temperature of the
air: I have even &s;een the thermometer &s;ink a de|gree
or half a degree when applied to the heart,
the temperature of the air being at that time on|ly
11&deg;. Now, we know that the heat of man,
and of mo&s;t quadrupeds, is always more than
30 degrees. It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that
the&s;e animals, who&s;e heat is &s;o &s;mall, &s;hould fall
into a benumbed &s;tate, whenever their internal
heat is not augmented by that of the external
air; and this always happens when the thermo|meter
exceeds not ten or eleven degrees above
the freezing point. This is the true cau&s;e of the
<PB N="327" REF="404">
torpid &s;tate of what are called the &s;leeping ani|mals;
a cau&s;e which, though common to all a|nimals
that &s;leep during winter, has hitherto been
overlooked. I have di&s;covered it in the three
animals under con&s;ideration, in the hedge-hogs,
and in the bats; and, though I have never had
an opportunity of examining the marmot, I am
per&s;uaded that its blood, like that of the other
&s;leepers, is cold; becau&s;e it is &s;ubject to torpor
during the winter.</P>
<P>This torpid &s;tate continues as long as the cau&s;e
by which it is produced, and cea&s;es with the cold.
A few degrees of heat above ten or eleven is &s;uf|ficient
to re-animate them; and, if kept in a
warm place during the winter, they are never
benumbed, but go about, and eat and &s;leep from
time to time, like other animals. When they
feel cold, they roll them&s;elves up in the form
of a ball, in order to expo&s;e le&s;s &s;urface to the
air, and to pre&s;erve their natural warmth. It is
in this form that they are found, during the win|ter,
in hollow trees, and in holes of walls expo&s;ed
to the &s;outh. There they lie, without the &s;mall|e&s;t
motion, upon mo&s;s and leaves; and, though
to&s;&s;ed about, they neither extend them&s;elves, nor
exhibit any &s;igns of life. From this &s;tate no|thing
can rou&s;e them but the application of a
gentle and gradual heat; for they die when &s;ud|denly
brought near a fire. Though, in this &s;tate,
they have no motion, though their eyes are &s;hut,
and they &s;eem to be deprived of every &s;en&s;ation;
<PB N="328" REF="405">
yet they feel pain when it is acute. A wound,
or a burn, makes them contract, and utter a low
cry, which they even repeat &s;everal times: Hence
their internal &s;en&s;ibility, as well as the action of
the heart and lungs, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It is pre&s;umable,
however, that the&s;e vital motions act not with
equal force as when the animal is in its ordinary
&s;tate. The circulation, it is probable, proceeds
in the large ve&s;&s;els only; the re&s;piration is &s;low
and feeble; the &s;ecretions are incon&s;iderable; and
no excrements are voided. There mu&s;t likewi&s;e
be little or no per&s;piration, &s;ince they pa&s;s &s;everal
months without eating, which could not happen,
if they lo&s;t as much of their &s;ub&s;tance by this
means, as they do at other times, when they
have an opportunity of repairing this natural
wa&s;te by taking nouri&s;hment. They &s;till, how|ever,
lo&s;e &s;ome part; becau&s;e, in long winters,
they die in their holes. Perhaps, likewi&s;e, it is
not the duration, but the rigour of the cold that
de&s;troys them; for they &s;oon die when expo&s;ed
to a &s;trong fro&s;t. What induces me to think that
they peri&s;h not by lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance, is, that in
autumn they are exceedingly fat, and equally &s;o
when they revive in the &s;pring. This quantity
of fat &s;erves for an internal nouri&s;hment to the
animal, and &s;upplies what it lo&s;es by re&s;pira|tion.</P>
<P>As cold is the only cau&s;e of their torpor, and
as they fall not into this &s;tate but when the tem|perature
of the air is below ten or eleven degrees,
<PB N="329" REF="406">
they frequently revive during the winter; for, in
this &s;ea&s;on, there are often many days when the
liquor in the thermometer &s;tands at 12, 13, 14,
and even higher degrees; and, during fine weather
of this kind, the dormice come out of their holes
in que&s;t of food, or eat what they had collected
in autumn. Ari&s;totle, and all the &s;ucceeding na|turali&s;ts,
have a&s;&s;erted, that the dormice pa&s;s the
whole winter without eating, that, in this &s;ea&s;on
of ab&s;tinence, they grow very fat, and that they
are better nouri&s;hed by &s;leep alone, than other
animals by food. This notion is both ab&s;urd and
impo&s;&s;ible. The dormou&s;e, who &s;leeps four or
five months, could only fatten by the air it re|&s;pires.
Suppo&s;ing a part of this air to be convert|ed
into nouri&s;hment, an augmentation &s;o con&s;i|derable
could never re&s;ult from it. It would not
even be &s;ufficient to repair the continual wa&s;te
occa&s;ioned by per&s;piration. Ari&s;totle might be
led into this error by the mild winters of Greece,
where the dormice &s;leep not perpetually, but of|ten
revive, take plenty of food, and are, therefore,
extremely fat, though in a torpid &s;tate. The
truth is, they are fat at all times, and particularly
in &s;ummer and autumn. Their fle&s;h re&s;embles
that of the Guiney-pig. The Romans reckoned
dormice among their mo&s;t delicate di&s;hes, and
reared them in great quantities. Varro de&s;cribes
the method of making warrens for them; and
we learn from Appicius the manner of dre&s;&s;ing
them in the high ta&s;te of his times. In this
<PB N="330" REF="407">
practice, whether from a di&s;gu&s;t at the&s;e animals,
becau&s;e they re&s;emble rats, or from the badne&s;s
of their fle&s;h, the Romans have not been follow|ed
by other nations. I have been informed by
pea&s;ants who had eat them, that they were not
better than water-rats. Be&s;ides, the fat &s;quirrel
is the only &s;pecies that is eatable; the fle&s;h of
the garden &s;quirrel is bad, and has a di&s;agreeable
flavour.</P>
<P>In manners and di&s;po&s;itions, the fat &s;quirrel
greatly re&s;embles the common &s;pecies. It lives
in fore&s;ts, climbs trees, and leaps from branch to
branch, with le&s;s agility indeed, becau&s;e the &s;quir|rel
has longer legs, and a body more light and
meagre. They both, however, live upon the
&s;ame food, namely, filberts, che&s;nuts, and wild
fruits. The fat &s;quirrel likewi&s;e eats &s;mall
birds, which he takes in their ne&s;ts. He makes
not a ne&s;t in the tops of trees, like the &s;quirrel;
but he makes a bed of mo&s;s in the hollows of
their trunks, or in the cliffs of rocks; but he al|ways
choo&s;es a dry place. He abhors moi&s;ture,
drinks little, and &s;eldom de&s;cends on the ground.
He differs &s;till more from the &s;quirrel in this cir|cum&s;tance,
that the latter is ea&s;ily tamed, and the
former continues always wild. They couple in
the end of &s;pring, and the females bring forth in
&s;ummer, the litter generally con&s;i&s;ting of four or
five. The young grow quickly; and we are a&s;|&s;ured
that they live only &s;ix years. In Italy,
where the&s;e animals are &s;till eat, the natives dig
<PB N="331" REF="408">
pits in the woods, and &s;trew them with &s;traw,
mo&s;s, and beach-ma&s;t. They choo&s;e dry places,
under the &s;helter of rocks, and with a &s;outh ex|po&s;ure.
To the&s;e the fat &s;quirrels re&s;ort in great
numbers, and the people find them there in a
torpid &s;tate towards the end of autumn, when
they are in the be&s;t condition for eating. The&s;e
&s;mall animals are bold, and defend their young
to the la&s;t extremity. They bite violently with
their fore-teeth, which are very long, and of
great &s;trength. They neither fear the wea&s;el nor
&s;mall birds of prey. They e&s;cape from the fox,
becau&s;e he cannot follow them to the tops of
trees. Their mo&s;t formidable enemies are the
martins and wild cats.</P>
<P>The fat &s;quirrels are not very generally dif|fu&s;ed.
They appear not in very cold climates,
&s;uch as tho&s;e of Lapland and Sweden; at lea&s;t
they are not mentioned by the northern natura|li&s;ts:
The &s;pecies they de&s;cribe is the dormou&s;e,
which is the lea&s;t of the three. Neither, I ima|gine,
are they to be met with in very warm coun|tries,
becau&s;e our travellers are &s;ilent on this ar|ticle.
There are few or none in open countries,
like Britain; they require temperate climates a|bounding
with wood. We find them in Spain,
in France, in Greece, in Italy, in Germany, and
in Switzerland, where they live in the fore&s;ts up|on
the hills, and not on the tops of high moun|tains,
like the marmots, who, though &s;ubject to
torpor from cold, &s;eem to delight in fro&s;t and
&s;nows.</P>

<P>THE fat &s;quirrel dwells in fore&s;ts, and &s;eems

ought to be careful to de&s;troy the garden &s;quir|rels.
They al&s;o climb with ea&s;e pear, apricot,
and plumb-trees; and, when &s;oft fruits are not
to be had, they eat almonds, filberts, nuts, and
even leguminous plants. Of the&s;e they carry off
great quantities into their retreats which they dig
in the earth, and particularly in well cultivated
gardens; for, in old orchyards, they are often
found in the hollows of old trees, where they
make beds of herbs, mo&s;s, and leaves. Cold be|numbs
or makes them &s;leep, and they are revived
by heat. Eight or ten of them are frequently
found in the &s;ame place, all benumbed, and rolled
up, in the mid&s;t of their provi&s;ion of nuts and
filberts. They copulate in &s;pring, and bring
forth in &s;ummer. The litter con&s;i&s;ts of five or

<P>THE Dormou&s;e is the lea&s;t ugly of all the
rats. It has brilliant eyes, and a bu&s;hy
tail, which is rather fair than red. It never lives
in hou&s;es, and &s;eldom in gardens; but, like the
fat &s;quirrel, frequents the woods, and dwells in
the hollows of old trees. The &s;pecies is by no
means &s;o numerous as that of the garden &s;quirrel.
The dormou&s;e is always found alone in its hole;
and there is a con&s;iderabel difficulty in procuring
&s;pecimens of them. It appears, however, that
they are pretty frequent in Italy, and that they
exi&s;t in northern climates; for Linnaeus men|tions
them, in his li&s;t of Swedi&s;h animals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Faun Suec. p. 11.</NOTE>. But

who had &s;een them in Italy, &s;ays, that the <HI>little

like that of Italy, and that perhaps it is a different
&s;pecies. In France, it is the &s;ame as in Italy, and

is very well de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovand. hi&s;t. quad. digit. p. 440.</NOTE>; but he
tells us, that there are two &s;pecies in Italy; the
one is rare, and has the &s;mell of mu&s;k; the o|ther
is common, and has no peculiar odour; and
that, at Bologna, they are both called dormice,
becau&s;e of their re&s;emblance in figure and &s;ize.
We know only the &s;econd of the&s;e &s;pecies; for
our dormou&s;e has no &s;mell, either good or bad.
Like the garden &s;quirrel, it wants the fatty folli|cles
which inve&s;t the inte&s;tines of the fat &s;quirrel,
never becomes &s;o fat, and, though its fle&s;h has no
di&s;agreeable odour, it makes not good eating.</P>
<P>Like the fat and garden &s;quirrels, the dormou&s;e
rolls it&s;elf up and &s;leeps in winter, revives in
mild weather, and ama&s;&s;es nuts and dry fruits.
It makes its ne&s;t upon trees, like the common
&s;quirrel, but generally lower, between the branches
of hazels, or bru&s;hwood. The ne&s;t, which con|&s;i&s;ts
of interwoven herbs, is about &s;ix inches dia|meter,
and is only open above. I have been a&s;|&s;ured
by many countrymen, that they have found
the&s;e ne&s;ts in cut woods, and in hedges; that
they are &s;urrounded with mo&s;s and leaves; and
that, in each ne&s;t, there were three or four young.
When they grow large, they abandon the ne&s;ts,
and harbour in the hollows or under the trunks
of old trees, where they repo&s;e, ama&s;s provi&s;ions,

<P>TO this &s;pecies of rat, which has only been
known for a few years pa&s;t, I have given
the appellation of <HI>Surmulot.</HI> This animal is
mentioned by no naturali&s;t, excepting M. Bri&s;|&s;on,
who calls it the <HI>wood-rat.</HI> It is larger and
more mi&s;chievous than the common rat. It has
reddi&s;h hair, a very long naked tail, and the &s;pine
of the back arched like that of the &s;quirrel. Its
body is likewi&s;e thicker; and it has whi&s;kers
like a cat. It is not above nine or ten years &s;ince
this &s;pecies was diffu&s;ed through the environs of
Paris. From whence the&s;e animals came, is un|certain;
but they have multiplied prodigiou&s;ly.
Neither is this wonderful, when we con&s;ider that
they generally produce from 12 to 15 young at
a litter, and &s;ometimes even the lenght of 19.
They were fir&s;t di&s;covered at Chantilly, Marly|la
Ville, and Ver&s;ailles, where they committed
<PB N="337" REF="416">
great ravages. M. le Roy favoured me with
great numbers of them, both living and dead, and
communicated to me the remarks he had made
upon this new &s;pecies. The males are larger,
&s;tronger, and more mi&s;chievous than the females.
When hard pur&s;ued, or when we attempt to &s;eize
them, they face about, and bite the &s;tick or the
hand that &s;trikes them. Their bite is not only
cruel, but dangerous; for it is in&s;tantly follow|ed
by a con&s;iderable &s;welling, and the wound,
though &s;mall, is long in healing. The females
bring forth three times a year: Hence two indi|viduals
of this &s;pecies may produce at lea&s;t 36
young in 12 months. The mothers prepare a
bed for their offspring. Some of the females &s;ent
us, whom we kept in cages, were with young;
and, two or three days before they brought forth,
we ob&s;erved that they gnawed the wood of the
cages, and made of the cuttings, which were in
con&s;iderable quantities, a convenient bed for their
little ones.</P>
<P>The brown rats have &s;ome qualities which make
them approach to the nature of the water-rat.
Though every where diffu&s;ed, they &s;eem to pre|fer
the banks of waters. The dogs pur&s;ue them
with the &s;ame remarkable fury as they chace the
water-rat. When pur&s;ued, and they find it equal|ly
ea&s;y to take to the water, or to conceal them|&s;elves
in bru&s;h-wood, they choo&s;e the water, enter
it without fear, and &s;wim with great dexterity and
ea&s;e. This phaenomenon is chiefly exhibited when
they cannot regain their holes; for, like the long|tailed
<PB N="338" REF="417">
field-mou&s;e, they dig &s;ubterraneous retreats,
or rather they ne&s;tle in tho&s;e made by the rab|bits.
The brown rats may be taken in their
holes by ferrets, who pur&s;ue them with equal ar|dour
as they do the rabbit.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals pa&s;s the &s;ummer in the coun|try:
And, though they feed principally upon
fruits and grain, they eat young hares, partridges,
and fowls: When they enter a hen-hou&s;e, like
the pole-cat, they kill more than they can eat.
Towards the month of November, the mother,
and all the young quit the fields, and come in
troops into the barns, where they do infinite mi&s;|chief,
by mincing the &s;traw, con&s;uming the grain,
and infecting every thing with their ordure. The
old males remain in the fields, each inhabiting
his own hole, where, like the field-mice, they
ama&s;s acorns, beach-ma&s;t, &amp;c. filling the holes to
the top, and remaining them&s;elves at the bottom.
They &s;leep not, like the dormou&s;e; but go out
in winter, e&s;pecially when the weather is mild.
Tho&s;e who take up their abode in barns, bani&s;h
all the mice and rats. It has even been remark|ed,
that, &s;ince the multiplication of the brown
rat about Paris, the common rats are much le&s;s
frequent.</P>

He learns to &s;eize a &s;tick, to dance, to perform
various ge&s;ticulations, and to obey the voice of
his ma&s;ter. Like the cat, he has an antipathy
again&s;t dogs. When he begins to be familiar in
the hou&s;e, and perceives that he is protected by
his ma&s;ter, he attacks and bites dogs of the mo&s;t
formidable kind. Though not &s;o large as a hare,
he is &s;touter, and his &s;trength is aided by a pe|culiar
&s;upplene&s;s and dexterity. With his fore|teeth,
which are pretty long, he bites mo&s;t cruel|ly.
He attacks not, however, either dogs or men,
unle&s;s when he is irritated. If not prevented, he
gnaws furniture and &s;tuffs, and, when confined,
even pierces through wood. As his limbs are
&s;hort, and his toes fa&s;hioned like tho&s;e of the
bear, he often &s;its on end, and walks with ea&s;e on
his hind-legs. He carries food to his mouth with
the fore-legs, and eats in the manner of a &s;quir|rel.
He runs pretty quick up hill, but &s;lowly
on a plain. He climbs trees, and mounts between
the cliffs of rocks, or two adjoining walls; and
the Savoyards, it is &s;aid, learned from the mar|mots
to climb for the purpo&s;e of &s;weeping chim|neys.
They eat every thing pre&s;ented to them,
as fle&s;h, bread, fruit, roots, pot-herbs, may-bugs,
<PB N="341" REF="421">
gra&s;s-hoppers, &amp;c.; but milk and butter they
prefer to every other aliment. Though le&s;s in|clined
to theft than the cat, they endeavour to
&s;lip into the dairy, where they drink great quan|tities
of milk, making, like the cat, a murmuring
noi&s;e expre&s;&s;ive of plea&s;ure. Be&s;ides, milk is the
only liquor that is agreeable to them; for they
rarely drink water; and they refu&s;e wine.</P>
<P>As to figure, the marmot has &s;ome re&s;em|blance
both to the bear and to the rat. It is not,
however, as Perrault, and &s;ome others imagined,
the <HI>arctomys</HI> or <HI>bear-rat</HI> of the antients. Its
no&s;e, lips, and form of the head re&s;emble tho&s;e
of the hare; it has the hair and claws of the bad|ger,
the teeth of the beaver, the whi&s;kers of the
cat, the eyes of the fat &s;quirrel, and the legs of
the bear. The tail is &s;hort, and the ears termi|nate
abruptly. The hair on the back is of a
reddi&s;h brown colour, more or le&s;s deep: This
hair is pretty rude; but that of the belly is red|di&s;h,
&s;oft, and bu&s;hy. Its voice re&s;embles the
murmuring of a young dog, when care&s;&s;ed, or in
a &s;porting humour. But, when irritated or
frighted, it makes a whi&s;tling noi&s;e, &s;o loud and
piercing, that it hurts the ear. It loves clean|line&s;s,
and retires, like the cat, to void its ordure.
But, like the rat, it has a very &s;trong di&s;agree|able
&s;mell, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer. It is remark|ably
fat in autumn: Be&s;ides a large epiploon, it
has two very thick fatty follicles. All the parts
of its body, however, are not equally fat. The
<PB N="342" REF="422">
back and reins are loaded with firm and &s;olid fat,
&s;imilar to the fle&s;h of a cow's udder. Thus the
marmot would make very good eating, if it had
not always a di&s;agreeble odour, which cannot
be concealed but by very &s;trong &s;ea&s;onings.</P>
<P>This animal, which delights in the regions of
fro&s;t and &s;now, and which is only found on the
tops of the highe&s;t mountains, is more &s;ubject
than any other to be rendered torpid by cold.
In the end of September, or beginning of Octo|ber,
he retires into his hole, from which he comes
not out till the beginning of April. His retreat
is made with precaution, and furni&s;hed with art.
It is capacious, broader than long, and very deep,
&s;o that it can contain &s;everal marmots, without
any danger from the corrupting of the air. With
their feet and claws, which are admirably adapt|ed
for the purpo&s;e, they dig the earth with a|mazing
quickne&s;s, and throw it behind them. It
is not a hole, or a &s;traight or winding tube, but
a &s;pecies of gallery made in the form of a Y,
each branch of which has an aperture, and both
terminate in one, where the animal lodges. As
the whole is made on the declivity of a mountain,
the innermo&s;t part alone is on a level. Both
branches of the Y are inclined, and the one is u&s;ed
for depo&s;iting the excrements of the animals, and
the other for their going out and coming in.
The place of their abode is well lined with mo&s;s
and hay, of which they make ample provi&s;ion
during the &s;ummer. It is even affirmed, that this
<PB N="343" REF="423">
labour is carried on jointly; that &s;ome cut the
fine&s;t herbage, which is collected by others, and
that they alternately &s;erve as vehicles for tran&s;|porting
it to their dens. One, it is &s;aid, lies
down on his back, allows him&s;elf to be loaded
with hay, extends his limbs, and others trail him
in this manner by the tail, taking care not to o|ver&s;et
him. The&s;e repeated frictions are a&s;&s;ign|ed
as the rea&s;on why the hair is generally rub|bed
off from their backs. But, it is more pro|bable,
that this effect is produced by their fre|quent
digging of the earth, which is &s;ufficient to
peel the hair off their backs. Whatever may be
in this, it is certain, that they dwell together, and
work in common at their habitations, where they
pa&s;s three fourths of their lives. Thither they
retire during rain, or upon the approach of dan|ger,
and never go out but in fine weather, and
even then to no great di&s;tance. One &s;tands &s;en|tinel
upon a rock, while the others &s;port on the
gra&s;s, or are employed in cutting it to make hay.
When the &s;entinel perceives a man, an eagle, a
dog, &amp;c. he alarms the re&s;t by a loud whi&s;tle,
and is him&s;elf the la&s;t to enter the hole.</P>
<P>They make no provi&s;ions for winter, as if they
divined that they would then have no u&s;e for
victuals. But, when they perceive the fir&s;t ap|proaches
of the &s;leeping &s;ea&s;on, they &s;et to work
in &s;hutting up the two entrances of their habita|tion;
and this they perform with &s;uch labour
and &s;olidity, that it is ea&s;ier to dig the earth any
<PB N="344" REF="424">
where el&s;e, than in the parts they have fortified.
They are at this time very fat, weighing &s;ome|times
twenty pounds; and they continue to be
plump for three months; but afterwards gradual|ly
decay, and are extremely emaciated at the
end of winter. When di&s;covered in their re|treats,
they are found rolled up in the form of a ball,
covered with hay; and they are carried off in &s;o
torpid a &s;tate, that they may be killed without
&s;eeming to feel pain. The fatte&s;t are cho&s;en for
eating, and the young ones for taming. Like
the dormice, they are revived by a gradual heat;
and tho&s;e which are fed in hou&s;es, and kept warm,
never become torpid, but are equally lively and
active in the winter as in the &s;ummer. As to the
&s;leeping of the marmot, we &s;hall not repeat what
was &s;aid under the article of the fat fquirrel. The
cooling of the blood is the &s;ole cau&s;e of this
pheanomenon; and it has been remarked by o|ther
writers, that, in this torpid condition, the cir|culation,
as well as all the &s;ecretions, were ex|tremely
languid, and that the blood, not being
renewed by fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions of chyle, has no &s;ero|&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. No. 397.</NOTE>.
Whether they remain con&s;tantly torpid
for &s;even or eight months, as is alledged by mo&s;t
authors, is uncertain. Their holes are deep, and
they live together in numbers; a con&s;iderable
heat, therefore, mu&s;t be pre&s;erved for &s;ome time,
and they may eat the herbage they have ama&s;&s;ed.
We are even told by M. Altmann, in his treati&s;e
<PB N="345" REF="425">
on the animals of Switzerland, that the hunters
allow the marmots to remain unmole&s;ted for
three weeks or a month; that they never dig in
&s;oft weather, or during a warm wind; that, with|out
the&s;e precautions, the marmots awaken and
dig &s;till deeper; but that, by opening their re|treats
during hard fro&s;ts only, they find them
&s;o torpid as to be carried off with ea&s;e. We may,
therefore, conclude, that they, in every re&s;pect,
re&s;emble the dormice; and that, if they remain
longer torpid, it is becau&s;e they inhabit a climate
where the winter is longer.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals produce but once a year, and
the litter generally con&s;i&s;ts of three or four. The
growth of their young is very quick; they live
only nine or ten years; and the &s;pecies is neither
numerous nor much diffu&s;ed. The Greeks were
unacquainted with the marmot, or, at lea&s;t, they
have made no mention of it. Among the Latins,
Pliny is the fir&s;t who takes notice of it, under
the name of <HI>mus Alpinus,</HI> or Alpine rat: And,
indeed, though there are &s;everal &s;pecies of rats
in the Alps, none of them is &s;o remarkable as the
marmot, or, like it, live in the &s;ummits of the
highe&s;t mountains. The other &s;pecies confine
them&s;elves to the vallies, the &s;ides of the hills,
or fir&s;t mountains. Be&s;ides, the marmot never
de&s;cends from the heights, but &s;eems peculiarly
attached to the chain of the Alps, and to prefer
a &s;outh or ea&s;t expo&s;ure to that of the north or
we&s;t. He is found, however, in the Appen|nines,
<PB N="346" REF="426">
the Pyrenees, and the highe&s;t mountains
of Germany. The <HI>bobak</HI> of Poland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Auctuarium Hi&s;t. Nat. Poloniae, auct. Rzaczyn&s;ki, p. 327.</NOTE>, to which

<HI>marmot,</HI> differs from this animal, not only in
colour, but in the number of toes; for it has five
toes on the fore feet. The claw of the great toe
appears beyond the &s;kin; and we find within,
the two phalanges of the fifth toe, which is en|tirely
wanting in the marmot. Hence the <HI>bo|bak,</HI>
or Poli&s;h marmot, the <HI>mouax,</HI> or marmot
of Canada, the <HI>cavia,</HI> or marmot of Bahama,
and the <HI>cricet,</HI> or marmot of Stra&s;burgh, are all
different &s;pecies from the Alpine marmot.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="supplement">
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have here given the figure of an animal cal|led
<HI>Monax,</HI> or <HI>Marmot of Canada.</HI> The de&s;ign
was &s;ent me by Mr Colin&s;on, but without any
de&s;cription. This &s;pecies of marmot &s;eems to
differ from the other marmots, by its having
only <HI>four</HI> toes on the fore-feet, while the Alpine
marmot and the bobak or Poli&s;h marmot have
<PB N="347" REF="427">
<HI>five</HI> toes both on the fore and the hind feet.
There is al&s;o &s;ome difference in the form of the
head, which is more thinly covered with hair.
The tail of the monax is longer and le&s;s bu&s;hy
than that of the common marmot; &s;o that this
Canada animal may regarded rather as a neigh|bouring
&s;pecies than as a &s;imple variety of the
Alpine marmot. In this &s;pecies, I pre&s;ume, the
animal called the <HI>Whi&s;tler</HI> by Baron Hontan,
may be ranked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Baron de la Honton, tom. 1. p. 95.</NOTE>. He &s;ays, that it is found in
the northern parts of Canada; that it is nearly
of the &s;ize of a hare, but &s;horter in the body;
that it is hunted only for its &s;kin, which is much
valued; but that its fle&s;h is not good. He adds,
that the Canadians call the&s;e animals <HI>Whi&s;tlers,</HI>
becau&s;e, in fine weather, they whi&s;tle at the en|trance
to their holes, which he has frequently
heard. Our Alpine marmot makes the &s;ame

<HEAD>The MARMOT of the Cape of
Good Hope.</HEAD>
<P>WE owe the fir&s;t notices of this animal to
M. Allamand, a learned naturali&s;t and
profe&s;&s;or at Leyden. M. Pallas has de&s;cribed it
under the name of <HI>Cavia Capen&s;is,</HI> and M. Vo&s;|maer
under that of the <HI>Ba&s;tard African Marmot.</HI>
Both have given a figure of it from the &s;ame
plate, of which M. Allamand has &s;ent me a copy.
<PB N="349" REF="429">
In writing on this &s;ubject to M. Daubenton, he
remarks:</P>
<P>'I &s;end you the figure of a &s;pecies of cabiai,
(I know no other name to give it), which I re|ceived
from the Cape of Good Hope. It is
not &s;o well drawn as I could wi&s;h; but, as I
have the animal &s;tuffed in my cabinet, if you
are inclined, I &s;hall tran&s;mit it to you by the
fir&s;t opportunity.'</P>
<P>We accepted not this obliging offer of M. Al|lamand,
becau&s;e we were &s;oon after informed,
that one or two of the&s;e animals had arrived in
Holland alive, and hoped that &s;ome naturali&s;t
would furni&s;h us with an exact de&s;cription. Both
Mr Pallas and Vo&s;maer have accordingly de&s;cri|bed
this animal, and I &s;hall here give extracts
from their remarks.</P>
<P>"This animal," &s;ays M. Vo&s;maer, "is known
at the Cape of Good Hope, under the name of
the <HI>Rock Badger,</HI> probably becau&s;e it lives a|mong
rocks, and under the earth, like the badger;
to which, however, it has no re&s;emblance. It
has a greater affinity to the marmot, and yet it
differs con&s;iderably from that animal. . . . . Kolbe is the fir&s;t who mentions this animal, and
he &s;ays, that it re&s;embles the marmot more than
the badger."</P>
<P>We &s;hall adopt the name of the <HI>Marmot of the
Cape,</HI> in preference to that of the cavia, becau&s;e
it differs from the cavia or cabiai in many re|&s;pects:
1. In the climate, the cavia being an
<PB N="350" REF="430">
animal of South America, while the other is found
only in Africa; 2. Becau&s;e cavia is a Bra&s;ilian
word, and ought not to be tran&s;ported into Afri|ca,
&s;ince it belongs to the true cavia, and to the
cavia-cobaia, or Guiney-pig; La&s;tly, becau&s;e the
cabiai inhabits only the margins of waters, and
has membranes between its toes; but the mar|mot
of the Cape lives among rocks, and in dry
grounds, which it can dig with its claws.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t animal of this &s;pecies," &s;ays M.
Vo&s;maer, "that appeared in Europe, was &s;ent
by M. Tulbagh to the Prince of Orange, and its
&s;kin is &s;till pre&s;erved in his cabinet. The colour
of the fir&s;t differed greatly from that of another
which arrived afterwards: It was very young
and very &s;mall. That which I am about to de|&s;cribe
was a male, and was &s;ent me by M. Berg|meyer
of Am&s;terdam. . . . . The life of this
animal, according to my information, is very me|lancholy;
for it &s;lept much during the voyage.
Its motion is &s;low, and performed by leaps. But,
perhaps, in a natural &s;tate, it is equally active as
the rabbit. Its cries were frequent, but &s;hort,
&s;harp, and piercing."</P>
<P>I &s;hall ob&s;erve in pa&s;&s;ing, that this character
brings the animal &s;till clo&s;er to the marmot; for
the Alpine marmots often make a &s;harp whi&s;|tling
noi&s;e.</P>
<P>"In Holland," continues M. Vo&s;maer, "they
feed this marmot with bread and different kinds
of pot-herbs. It is probable that this animal
<PB N="351" REF="431">
brings forth often, and in great numbers. The
form of their feet indicates that they are de&s;tined
for digging the earth. The pre&s;ent marmot ha|ving
died at Am&s;terdam, I gave it for di&s;&s;ection
to M. Pallas.</P>
<P>"In &s;tature, it re&s;embles the common rabbit,
but it is thicker and more collected. The belly
is peculiarly gro&s;s; the eyes are beautiful, and
of an ordinary &s;ize. The eye-brows, both above
and below, are garni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;hort black
hairs, above which there are five or &s;ix hairs of
the &s;ame colour, but long, that turn back toward
the head. It has &s;imilar whi&s;kers on the upper
lip, about the middle of the muzzle.</P>
<P>The no&s;e is black, naked, and divided by a
fine future, which de&s;cends to the lip. The no|&s;trils
re&s;emble a cord broke through the middle.
Under the muzzle, on the throat, and the
cheeks, are &s;ome long, rude, black hairs; and
hairs of the &s;ame kind are &s;cattered over the
whole body. In the palate there are eight deep
furrows; the tongue is very thick, tolerably long,
garni&s;hed with &s;mall papillae, and oval at the
point. In the upper jaw, there are two &s;trong
teeth, which protrude over the under jaw, and
are con&s;iderably di&s;tant from each other, having
a kind of triangular appearance. In the under
jaw, it has four clo&s;e cutting teeth, which are
very broad, long, and flat. The grinders, of
which it has four on each &s;ide, are al&s;o large;
and a fifth of a &s;maller &s;ize may be added to the
<PB N="352" REF="432">
number. Its fore-legs are &s;hort, and half cover|ed
with the &s;kin of the body. The feet are black
and naked. Tho&s;e before have four toes, the
one in the middle longe&s;t; and the exterior one
is &s;horter, and &s;eems to adhere to the third. The
toes are armed with round &s;hort claws, which ad|here
to the &s;kin like the human nails. There
are three toes on the hind feet; the middle one
only is furni&s;hed with a crooked claw, and the
exterior toe is &s;horter than the others. The ani|mal
leaps on its hind legs, like the rabbit. It
has not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of a tail. The co|lour
of the hair is gray, or a yellowi&s;h brown,
nearly like that of a wild rabbit; but it is deep|er
upon the head and back; and the brea&s;t and
belly are whiti&s;h. There is al&s;o a whiti&s;h belt
upon the neck and near the &s;houlders. This
belt forms not a collar, but terminates at the top
of the fore-legs. In general, the hair is &s;oft and
woolly."</P>
