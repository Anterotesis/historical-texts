<HEAD>REASONS
FOR
CONTENTMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN life has been &s;aid to re&s;emble
the &s;ituation of &s;pectators in a theatre,
where, whil&s;t each per&s;on is engaged by the
&s;cene which pa&s;&s;es before him, no one thinks
about the place in which he is &s;eated. It is
only when the bu&s;ine&s;s is interrupted, or
when the &s;pectator's attention to it grows
idle and remi&s;s, that he begins to con&s;ider at
all, who is before him or who is behind
him, whether others are better accommoda|ted
than him&s;elf, or whether many be not
much wor&s;e. It is thus with the various
ranks and &s;tations of &s;ociety. So long as a
man is intent upon the duties and concerns of
his own condition, he never thinks of com|paring
it with any other; he is never troub|led
with reflections upon the different cla&s;&s;es
and orders of mankind, the advantages or
di&s;advantages of each, the nece&s;&s;ity or
non-nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of civil di&s;tinctions, much le&s;s
does he feel within him&s;elf a di&s;po&s;ition to
covet or envy any of them. He is too much
taken up with the occupations of his calling,
its pur&s;uits, cares, and bu&s;ine&s;s, to be&s;tow
unprofitable meditations upon the circum|&s;tances
in which he &s;ees others placed. And
by this means a man of a &s;ound and active
mind has, in his very con&s;titution, a remedy
again&s;t the di&s;turbance of envy and di&s;con|tent.
The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions gain no admittance
into his brea&s;t, becau&s;e there is no lei&s;ure
there or vacancy for the trains of thought
which generate them. He enjoys therefore
ea&s;e in this re&s;pect, and ea&s;e re&s;ulting from
the be&s;t cau&s;e, the power of keeping his
imagination at home; of con&s;ining it to
what belongs to him&s;elf, in&s;tead of &s;ending
it forth to wander among&s;t &s;peculations
which have neither limits nor u&s;e, amid&s;t
views of unattainable grandeur, fancied hap|pine&s;s,
of extolled, becau&s;e unexperienced,
privileges and delights.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e&s;t advice that can be given is,
never to allow our attention to dwell upon
compari&s;ons between our own condition and
that of others, but to keep it fixed upon the
duties and concerns of the condition it&s;elf.
But &s;ince every man has not this power;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;ince the minds of &s;ome men will be bu&s;y
in contemplating the advantages which they
&s;ee others po&s;&s;e&s;s, and &s;ince per&s;ons in labo|rious
&s;tations of life are wont to view the
higher ranks of &s;ociety, with &s;entiments
which not only tend to make them&s;elves
unhappy, but which are very different from
the truth, it may be an u&s;eful office to
point out to them &s;ome of the&s;e con&s;idera|tions,
which, if they <HI>will</HI> turn their thoughts
to the &s;ubject, they &s;hould endeavour to take
fairly into the account.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, we are mo&s;t of us apt to mur|mur,
when we &s;ee exorbitant fortunes pla|ced
in the hands of &s;ingle per&s;ons; larger,
we are &s;ure, than they can want, or, as we
think, than they can u&s;e. This is &s;o com|mon
a reflection that I will not &s;ay it is not
natural. But whenever the complaint comes
into our minds, we ought to recollect, that
the thing happens in con&s;equence of tho&s;e
very rules and laws which &s;ecure to our&s;elves
our property, be it ever &s;o &s;mall. The laws
which accidentally ca&s;t enormous e&s;tates in|to
one great man's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, are, after all,
the &s;elf &s;ame laws which protect and guard
the poor man. Fixed rules of property are
e&s;tabli&s;hed, for one as well as another, with|out
knowing, before hand, whom they may
<PB N="6" REF="5">
affect. If the&s;e rules &s;ometimes throw an
exce&s;&s;ive or di&s;proportionate &s;hare to one
man's lot, who can help it? It is much
better that it &s;hould be &s;o, than that the
rules them&s;elves &s;hould be broken up: and
you can only have one &s;ide of the alternative
or the other. To aboli&s;h riches would not
be to aboli&s;h poverty; but, on the contrary,
to leave it without protection or re&s;ource.
It is not for the poor man to repine at the
effects of laws and rules by which he him|&s;elf
is benefited every hour of his exi&s;tence;
which &s;ecure to him his earnings, his habi|tation,
his bread, his life; without which he,
no more than the rich man, could either
eat his meal in quietne&s;s, or go to bed in
&s;afety. Of the two, it is rather more the
concern of the poor to &s;tand up for the laws
than of the rich; for it is the law which
defends the weak again&s;t the &s;trong, the
humble again&s;t the powerful, the little
again&s;t the great; and weak and &s;trong,
humble and powerful, little and great there
would be, even were there no laws whatever.
Be&s;ide; what after all is the mi&s;chief? The
owner of a great e&s;tate does not eat or drink
more than the owner of a &s;mall one. His
fields do not produce wor&s;e crops, nor does
the produce maintain fewer mouths. If
<PB N="7" REF="6">
e&s;tates were more equally divided, would
greater numbers be fed, or clothed, or em|ployed?
Either therefore large fortunes are
not a public evil, or, if they be in any de|gree
an evil, it is to be borne with for the
&s;ake of tho&s;e fixed and general rules con|cerning
property, in the pre&s;ervation and
&s;teadine&s;s of which all are intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Fortunes however of any kind, from the na|ture
of the thing, can only fall to the lot of a
few. I &s;ay, "from the nature of the thing."
The very utmo&s;t that can be done by laws
and government, is to enable every man,
who hath health, to procure a healthy &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
for him&s;elf and a family. Where
this is the ca&s;e, things are at their perfec|tion.
They have reached their limit. Were
the princes and nobility, the legi&s;lators and
coun&s;ellors of the land, all of them, the be&s;t
and wi&s;e&s;t men that ever lived, their united
virtue and wi&s;dom could do no more than
this. They, if any &s;uch there be, who
would teach you to expect more, give you
no in&s;tance where more has ever been at|tained.</P>
<P>But Providence which fore&s;aw, which ap|pointed
indeed, the nece&s;&s;ity to which hu|man
affairs are &s;ubjected, and again&s;t which
it were impious to complain, hath contrived
<PB N="8" REF="7">
that, whil&s;t fortunes are only for a few, the
re&s;t of mankind may be happy without
them. And this leads us to con&s;ider the
comparative advantages and comforts which
belong to the condition of tho&s;e, who &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
as the great ma&s;s of every people do and
mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t, by per&s;onal labour, and the
&s;olid rea&s;ons they have for contentment in
their &s;tations. I do not now u&s;e the terms
poor and rich, becau&s;e that man is to be ac|counted
poor, of whatever rank he be, and
&s;uffers the pains of poverty, who&s;e expences
exceed his re&s;ources; and no man is, pro|perly
&s;peaking, poor but he. But I at pre|&s;ent
con&s;ider the advantages of tho&s;e labori|ous
conditions of life, which compo&s;e the
great portion of every human community.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, it is an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of
&s;uch &s;ituations, that they &s;upply a con&s;tant
train of employment both to body and
mind. A hu&s;bandman, or a manufacturer,
or a trade&s;man, never goes to bed at night
without having his bu&s;ine&s;s to ri&s;e up to in
the morning. He would under&s;tand the
value of this advantage, did he know that
the want of it compo&s;es one of the greate&s;t
plagues of the human &s;oul; a plague by
which the rich, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who inhe|rit
riches, are exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ed. Indeed
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y">
it is to get rid of it, that is to &s;ay, it is to
have &s;omething to do, that they are driven
upon tho&s;e &s;trange and unaccountable ways
of pa&s;&s;ing their time, in which we &s;ome|times
&s;ee them, to our &s;urpri&s;e, engaged. A poor man's condition &s;upplies him with
that, which no man can do without, and
which a rich man, with all his opportunities
and all his contrivance, can hardly &s;upply
him&s;elf, regular engagement, bu&s;ine&s;s to
look forward to, &s;omething to be done for
every day, &s;ome employment prepared for
every morning. A few of better judgement
can &s;eek out for them&s;elves con&s;tant and
u&s;eful occupation. There is not one of you
takes the pains in his calling, which &s;ome of
the mo&s;t independent men in the nation
have taken, and are taking, to promote what
they deem to be a point of great concern to
the intere&s;ts of humanity, by which neither
they nor theirs can ever gain a &s;hilling, and in
which, &s;hould they &s;ucceed, tho&s;e who are to
be benefited by their &s;ervice, will never know
nor thank them for it. I only mention this
to &s;how, in conjunction with what has been
ob&s;erved above, that of tho&s;e who are at liber|ty
to act as they plea&s;e, the wi&s;e prove, and the
fooli&s;h confe&s;s, by their conduct, that a life
of employment is the only life worth lead|ing;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and that the chief difference between
their manner of pa&s;&s;ing their time and yours
is, that they can chu&s;e the objects of their
activity, which you cannot. This privilege
may be an advantage to &s;ome, but for nine
out of ten it is fortunate, that occupation is
provided to their hands, that they have it
not to &s;eek, that it is impo&s;ed upon them
by their nece&s;&s;ities and occa&s;ions; for the
con&s;equence of liberty in this re&s;pect would
be, that, lo&s;t in the perplexity of choo&s;ing,
they would &s;ink into irrecoverable indolence,
inaction, and unconcern; into that vacancy
and tire&s;omene&s;s of time and thought which
are in&s;eparable from &s;uch a &s;ituation. A
man's thoughts mu&s;t be going. Whil&s;t he
is awake, the working of his mind is as
con&s;tant as the beating of his pul&s;e. He
can no more &s;top the one than the other.
Hence if our thoughts have nothing to act
upon, they act upon our&s;elves. They ac|quire
a corro&s;ive quality. They become in
the la&s;t degree irk&s;ome and tormenting.
Wherefore that &s;ort of equable engagement,
which takes up the thoughts &s;ufficiently, yet
&s;o as to leave them capable of turning to
any thing more important, as occa&s;ions offer
or require, is a mo&s;t invaluable ble&s;&s;ing. And
if the indu&s;trious, be not &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="10">
it is for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e
they have never experienced, or rather &s;uf|fered,
the want of it.</P>
<P>Again; &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ities which
poverty (if the condition of the labouring
part of mankind mu&s;t be &s;o called) impo&s;es,
are not hard&s;hips but plea&s;ures. Frugality
it&s;elf is a plea&s;ure. It is an exerci&s;e of at|tention
and contrivance, which, whenever it
is &s;ucce&s;sful, produces &s;atisfaction. The
very care and foreca&s;t that are nece&s;&s;ary to
keep expences and earnings upon a level
form, when not embarra&s;&s;ed by too great
difficulties, are an agreeable engagement of
the thoughts. This is lo&s;t amid&s;t abundance.
There is no plea&s;ure in taking out of a large
unmea&s;ured fund. They who do that, and
only that, are the mere conveyors of money
from one hand to another.</P>
<P>A yet more &s;erious advantage which per|&s;ons
in inferior &s;tations po&s;&s;e&s;s, is the ca&s;e
with which they provide for their children.
All the provi&s;ion which a poor man's child re|quires
is contained in two words, "indu&s;try
and innocence." With the&s;e qualities, tho'
without a &s;hilling to &s;et him forwards, he
goes into the world prepared to become an
u&s;eful, virtuous, and happy man. Nor
will he fail to meet with a maintenance
adequate to the habits with which he has
<PB N="12" REF="11">
been brought up, and to the expectations
which he has formed; a degree of &s;ucce&s;s
&s;ufficient for a per&s;on of any condition
whatever. The&s;e qualities of indu&s;try and
innocence, which, I repeat again, are all that
are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, every parent can
give to his children without expence, be|cau&s;e
he can give them by his own authority
and example; and they are to be commu|nicated,
I believe, and pre&s;erved in no
other way. I call this a &s;erious advantage
of humble &s;tations, becau&s;e, in what we reck|on
&s;uperior ranks of life, there is a real dif|ficulty
in placing children in &s;ituations,
which may in any degree &s;upport them in
the cla&s;s and in the habits in which they
have been brought up with their parents:
from which great and oftentimes di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
perplexity the poor are free. With health
of body, innocency of mind, and habits of
indu&s;try, a poor man's child has nothing to
be afraid of; nor his father or mother any
thing to be afraid of for him.</P>
<P>The labour of the world is carried on by
<HI>&s;ervice,</HI> that is, by one man working under
another man's direction. I take it for
granted, that this is the be&s;t way of con|ducting
bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e all nations and
ages have adopted it. Con&s;equently &s;ervice

What then (for this is the fair way of cal|culating)
is there in higher &s;tations to place

<P>Was there as much in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures&punc;

of. Habits of all kinds are much the &s;ame&punc;
Whatever is habitual becomes &s;mooth, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
indifferent, and nothing more. The luxu|rious
<PB N="15" REF="14">
receive no greater plea&s;ures from their
dainties, than the pea&s;ant does from his
homely fare. But here is the difference.
The pea&s;ant, whenever he goes abroad, finds
a fea&s;t, whereas the epicure mu&s;t be &s;ump|tuou&s;ly
entertained to e&s;cape di&s;gu&s;t. They
who &s;pend every day in diver&s;ions, and they
who go every day about their u&s;ual bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
pa&s;s their time much alike. Attending
to what they are about, wanting nothing,
regretting nothing, they are both, whil&s;t
engaged, in a &s;tate of ea&s;e; but then what|ever
&s;u&s;pends the pur&s;uits of the man of
diver&s;ion di&s;tre&s;&s;es him, whereas to the la|bourer
or the man of bu&s;ine&s;s every pau&s;e is
a recreation. And this is a va&s;t advantage
which they po&s;&s;e&s;s who are trained and
inured to a life of occupation, above the man
who &s;ets up for a life of plea&s;ure. Variety is
&s;oon exhau&s;ted. Novelty it&s;elf is no longer
new. A mu&s;ements are become too familiar
to delight, and he is in a &s;ituation in which
he can never change but for the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Another article, which the poor are apt to
envy in the rich, is their <HI>ca&s;e.</HI> Now here
they mi&s;take the matter totally. They call
inaction ea&s;e, whereas nothing is farther
from it. Re&s;t is ea&s;e. That is true. But no
man can re&s;t who has not worked. Re&s;t is the
<PB N="16" REF="15">
ce&s;&s;ation of labour. It cannot therefore be
enjoyed, or even ta&s;ted, except by tho&s;e who
have known fatigue. The rich &s;ee, and not
without envy, the refre&s;hment and plea&s;ure
which re&s;t affords to the poor, and chu&s;e to
wonder that they cannot find the &s;ame en|joyment
in being free from the nece&s;&s;ity of
working at all. They do not ob&s;erve that
this enjoyment mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed by pre|vious
labour, and that he who will not pay
the prices, cannot have the gratification.
Being without work is one thing; repo&s;ing
from work is another. The one is as tire|&s;ome
and in&s;ipid, as the other is &s;weet and
&s;oothing. The one in general is the fate of
the rich man, the other is the fortune of the
poor. I have heard it &s;aid that if the face
of happine&s;s can any where be &s;een, it is in
the &s;ummer evening of a country village.
Where, after the labours of the day, each
man, at his door, with his children, among&s;t
his neighbours, feels his frame and his heart
at re&s;t, every thing about him plea&s;ed and
plea&s;ing, and a delight and complacency in
his &s;en&s;ations far beyond what either luxury
or diver&s;ion can afford. The rich want this;
and they want what they mu&s;t never have.</P>
<P>As to &s;ome other things which the poor
are di&s;po&s;ed to envy in the condition of the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
rich, &s;uch as their &s;tate, their appearance,
the grandeur of their hou&s;es, dre&s;s, equi|page,
and attendance, they only envy the
rich the&s;e things, becau&s;e they do not know
the rich. They have not opportunities of
ob&s;erving with what neglect and in&s;en&s;ibi|lity
the rich po&s;&s;e&s;s and regard the&s;e things
them&s;elves. If they could &s;ee the great
man in his retirement, and in his actual
manner of life, they would find him, if
plea&s;ed at all, taking plea&s;ure in &s;ome of
tho&s;e &s;imple enjoyments which they can
command as well as he. They would find
him among&s;t his children, in his hu&s;bandry,
in his garden, pur&s;uing &s;ome rural diver&s;ion,
or occupied with &s;ome trifling exerci&s;e,
which are all gratifications, as much within
the power and reach of the poor man, as of
the rich; or rather more &s;o.</P>
<P>To learn the art of contentment, is only
to learn what happine&s;s actually con&s;i&s;ts in.
Sen&s;ual plea&s;ures add little to its &s;ub&s;tance.
Ea&s;e, if by that be meant exemption from
labour, contributes nothing. One, however,
con&s;tant &s;pring of &s;atisfaction, and almo&s;t
infallible &s;upport of chearfulne&s;s and &s;pirits,
is the exerci&s;e of dome&s;tic affections; the
pre&s;ence of objects of tenderne&s;s and endear|ment
in our families, our kindred, our
<PB N="18" REF="17">
friends. Now have the poor any thing to
complain of here? Are they not &s;urrounded
by their relatives as generally as others.
The poor man has his wife and children
about him; and what has the rich man
more? He has the &s;ame enjoyment of
their &s;ociety, the &s;ame &s;olicitude for their
welfare, the &s;ame plea&s;ure in their good
qualities, improvement and &s;ucce&s;s: their
connection with him is as &s;trict and inti|mate,
their attachment as &s;trong, their gra|titude
as warm. I have no propen&s;ity to
envy any one, lea&s;t of all the rich and great;
but if I were di&s;po&s;ed to this weakne&s;s, the
&s;ubject of my envy would be, a healthy
young man, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;trength
and faculties, going forth in a morning to
work for his wife and children, or bringing
them home his earnings at night.</P>
<P>But was difference of rank or fortune of
more importance to per&s;onal happine&s;s than
it is, it would be ill purcha&s;ed by any &s;ud|den
or violent change of condition. An
alteration of circum&s;tances, which breaks up
a man's habits of life, deprives him of his
occupation, removes him from his ac|quaintance,
may be called an elevation of
fortune, but hardly ever brings with it an
addition of enjoyment. They to whom ac|cidents
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of this &s;ort have happened never
found them to an&s;wer their expectations.
After the fir&s;t hurry of the change is over,
they are &s;urpri&s;ed to feel in them&s;elves,
li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and dejection, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
&s;olitude, vacancy and re&s;traint, in the place
of chearfulne&s;s, liberty, and ea&s;e. They try
to make up for what they have lo&s;t, &s;ome|times
by a bea&s;tly &s;otti&s;hne&s;s, &s;ometimes by
a fooli&s;h di&s;&s;ipation, &s;ometimes by a &s;tupid
&s;loth; all which effects are only &s;o many
confe&s;&s;ions, that changes of this &s;ort were
not made for man. If any public di&s;|turbance
&s;hould produce not an equality,
(for that is not the proper name to give it)
but a jumble of ranks and profe&s;&s;ions
among&s;t us, it is not only evident what the
rich would lo&s;e, but there is al&s;o this further
mi&s;fortune, that what the rich lo&s;t the poor
would not gain. I (God knows) could not
get my livelihood by labour, nor would the
labourer find any &s;olace or enjoyment in my
&s;tudies. If we were to exchange conditions
to-morrow, all the effect would be, that we
both &s;hould be more mi&s;erable, and the
work of both be wor&s;e done. Without deba|ting
therefore, what might be very difficult
to decide, which of our two conditions was
better to begin with, one point is certain,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
that it is be&s;t for each to remain in his
own. The change, and the only change, to
be de&s;ired, is that gradual and progre&s;&s;ive
improvement of our circum&s;tances, which
is the natural fruit of &s;ucce&s;sful indu&s;try;
when each year is &s;omething better than the
la&s;t; when we are enabled to add to our
little hou&s;ehold one article after another of
new comfort or conveniency, as our profits
increa&s;e, or our burthen becomes le&s;s; and,
what is be&s;t of all, when we can afford, as
our &s;trength declines, to relax our labours,
or divide our cares. This may be looked
forward to, and is practicable, by great
numbers, in a &s;tate of public order and
quiet, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible in any
other.</P>
<P>If in comparing the different conditions
of &s;ocial life we bring religion into the ac|count,
the argument is &s;till ea&s;ier. Religion
&s;mooths all inequalities, becau&s;e it unfolds a
pro&s;pect which makes all earthly di&s;tinctions
nothing. And I do allow that there are
many ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, affliction, and di&s;|tre&s;s,
which Chri&s;tianity alone can comfort.
But in e&s;timating the mere diver&s;ities of &s;ta|tion
and civil condition, I have not thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce religion into the
enquiry at all, becau&s;e I contend, that the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
man who murmurs and repines, when he
has nothing to murmur and repine about,
but the mere want of independent property,
is not only irreligious, but ill founded and
unrea&s;onable in his complaint; and that he
would find, did he know the truth, and
con&s;ider his ca&s;e fairly, that a life of labour,
&s;uch I mean as is led by the labouring part
of mankind in this country, has advantages
in it, which compen&s;ate all its inconvenien|cies.
When compared with the life of the
rich, it is better in the&s;e important re&s;pects.
It &s;upplies employment, it promotes activity.
It keeps the body in better health, the mind
more engaged, and, of cour&s;e, more quiet.
It is more &s;en&s;ible of ea&s;e, more &s;u&s;ceptible
of plea&s;ure. It is attended with greater ala|crity
of &s;pirits, a more con&s;tant chearfulne&s;s
and &s;erenity of temper. It affords ea&s;ier
and more certain methods of &s;ending chil|dren
into the world in &s;ituations &s;uited to
their habits and expectations. It is free
from many heavy anxieties which rich men
feel; it is fraught with many &s;ources of de|light
which they want.</P>
<P>If to the&s;e rea&s;ons for contentment the
reflecting hu&s;bandman or artificer adds
another very material one, that changes of
condition, which are attended with a breaking
<PB N="22" REF="21" MS="y">
up and &s;acrifice of our ancient cour&s;e
and habit of living, never can be productive
of happine&s;s, he will perceive, I tru&s;t, that
to covet the &s;tations or fortunes of the rich,
or &s;o however to covet them, as to wi&s;h to
&s;eize them by force, or through the medium
of public uprore and confu&s;ion, is not only
wickedne&s;s, but folly; as mi&s;taken in the
end, as in the means; <HI>that it is not only to
venture out to &s;ea in &s;torm, but to venture for
nothing.</HI></P>
