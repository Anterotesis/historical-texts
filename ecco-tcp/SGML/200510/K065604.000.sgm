<HEAD>THE
Minute Mathematician, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Cambridge, <DATE>June 13, 1735.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>_I Freely own to you, when I &s;at
down to write my defen&s;e of
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and the Bri|ti&s;h
Mathematicians, I was not
a little moved at the treatment
you had been plea&s;ed to give to one or two
of tho&s;e Great Men, whom I am proud to call
my Ma&s;ter, and who&s;e memories on that ac|count
I &s;hall always reverence and honour.
<HI>But now,</HI> you tell me, <HI>I may be &s;uppo&s;ed cool.</HI>
I am &s;o: partly through the length of time
that has intervened; and partly by con&s;ider|ing
the &s;everity of the di&s;cipline you have
undergone. It has had, I &s;ee, a marvellous
effect upon you. One may plainly perceive
an alteration, notwith&s;tanding your endea|vours
to conceal it, not only in your &s;enti|ments,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
but in your language, your behaviour,
and your very air. You no longer breathe
that &s;uperiority and contempt of all mankind
you were wont to &s;hew. This change in you
has greatly mitigated <HI>the pa&s;&s;ion</HI> with which I
was before <HI>overcome.</HI></P>
<P>In this calm and cool &s;tate therefore when
I reflect upon what is pa&s;t, I am not a little
&s;tartled at my own audaciou&s;ne&s;s and pre|&s;umption,
in entring the li&s;ts again&s;t &s;o re|doubtable
an adver&s;ary as the Author of the
Minute Philo&s;opher. To you, likewi&s;e, I
find, this pre&s;umption of mine appeared &s;o
extraordinary, that though you are &s;o good as
to qualify it by the &s;ofter name of <HI>courage,
you could not but admire it, it &s;eemed unaccount|able
to you, till you reflected on my &s;eeming &s;e|cure
in the favour of one part of my readers,
and the ignorance of the other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neverthele&s;s you are per&s;uaded there are fair
and candid men among the Mathematicians.</HI> I
likewi&s;e am per&s;uaded not only that there are
fair and candid men among the Mathemati|cians;
but that generally &s;peaking Mathema|ticians
are fair and candid men. What &s;hould
make them otherwi&s;e? Are their opinions di|ge&s;ted
into Creeds and Articles, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
by Law? Has the Publick thought fit to
<PB N="3" REF="10">
be&s;tow dignities and large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on
them, which are not to be obtained without
embracing tho&s;e opinions, nor to be retained
without per&s;evering in them? Were even
this the Ca&s;e; yet &s;urely there would be
found among them fair and candid men. I
am &s;ure I know many &s;uch among another
&s;et of men in the&s;e very circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Ay, but this other &s;et of men, you will
&s;ay, have nothing but truth to defend. I
grant it. And I take this to be the ca&s;e of
the Mathematicians likewi&s;e. They are at
lea&s;t as good rea&s;oners as any other &s;et of
men what&s;oever, and con&s;equently are as
likely to know truth, when they meet it, and
have nothing to hinder them from embra|cing
it. It is therefore on their judgment,
not their favour, that I depend.</P>
<P>But you &s;peak of <HI>the ignorance of the other
part of my Readers.</HI> Alas! Sir, of what ad|vantage
can that be to me? To me, <HI>Phila|lethes,</HI>
who aim at truth alone, who have
no intere&s;t in deceiving them?</P>
<P>Were I indeed the Author of the Minute
Philo&s;opher: <HI>Had</HI> I any <HI>other end to &s;erve
than truth</HI>: Were I ma&s;ter of a&s;&s;urance e|nough
to mi&s;lead my reader at the in&s;tant
that I call out to him to mind his way; to
<PB N="4" REF="11">
de&s;ire him to examine, while I am mi&s;in|forming
him; to throw du&s;t in his eyes, and
bid him &s;ee: then undoubtedly much might
be done. But the&s;e are arts I neither need
nor practi&s;e. I content my &s;elf with the
plain hone&s;t way of giving my Reader the
be&s;t light I can, neither mi&s;leading him my
&s;elf, nor &s;uffering him to be mi&s;led by others.
With this view it is that I divide my reply
into the &s;ame number of &s;ections with your
defen&s;e, and confine my &s;ections to the &s;ame
matter with yours. This will indeed make
what I have to &s;ay &s;omewhat le&s;s methodical,
but then it will enable the Reader more ea|&s;ily
to compare us together, and to make a
more certain deci&s;ion between us.</P>
<P>The taking this method, Sir, will make it
plainly appear, that what I aim at is only
manife&s;ting the truth; and con&s;equently that
the rea&s;on of my courage in encountering
you, is my being verily per&s;uaded that I have
truth and ju&s;tice on my &s;ide. I know and am
aware of your &s;uperior accompli&s;hments:
But <HI>Philalethes</HI> is my name: And truth will
prevail again&s;t the pens of men or angels.
Your vanity has engaged you in a difficulty,
from which all your abilities &s;hall never ex|tricate
you.</P>
<Q><PB N="5" REF="12">
<L>Verte omnes tete in facies, &amp; contrahe quicquid</L><L>Sive animis, &s;ive arte vales.</L></Q>
<P>Your arms are wedged in the oak you have
pre&s;umptuou&s;ly attempted to rend: Your
&s;trength is no longer of any u&s;e to defend
you: A woman, a child may be too hard
for you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. Your &s;econd &s;ection teaches us, <HI>that
things ob&s;cure are not therefore &s;acred; and
that it is no more a crime to canva&s;s and detect
un&s;ound principles or fal&s;e rea&s;onings in Mathe|maticks,
than in any other part of Learning.</HI>
I agree with you. I go farther. It can never
be a crime, but on the contrary is highly lau|dable,
to canva&s;s and to examine the princi|ples
and rea&s;oning made u&s;e of in any &s;cience
what&s;oever, and that with the utmo&s;t free|dom
and impartiality. All ingenuous minds
will be plea&s;ed with &s;uch an examination:
They will readily con&s;ent that the &s;cience
they profe&s;s, be brought to the &s;evere&s;t and
&s;tricte&s;t trial. Truth can never be hurt by
Inquiry: Truth loves the light: But error,
fal&s;hood and impo&s;ture dread and abhor it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
III. I am much at a lo&s;s here. You &s;peak
of<HI> men who reject that VERY THING in Reli|gion
which they admit in human Learning.</HI> Do
they <HI>admit that Fluxions are</HI> to them <HI>mo&s;t in|comprehen&s;ible
My&s;teries</HI>? Do they, notwith|&s;tanding
this conce&s;&s;ion, <HI>believe them to be
clear and &s;cientifick</HI>? Do they, notwith&s;tand|ing
this belief, <HI>entertain an implicit faith in
the Author of that Method</HI>? The&s;e things &s;eem
hard to reconcile.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<P>IV. I do not a&s;k, Why you cho&s;e to de|fame
Mathematicians in the month of <HI>March,</HI>
<HI>Ann. Dom.</HI> 1734, rather than at any time be|fore?
The only que&s;tion with me was, Whe|ther
Vanity or Chri&s;tianity were the motive
to writing the Analy&s;t. <HI>Quae relligio aut quae
machina belli?</HI> I have fully proved there was
no Religion, no Chri&s;tianity in it. It was
partly Vanity, partly Machine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P>V. Here I would ob&s;erve, that whoever
admires Fluxions, mu&s;t admire them for
&s;omething of excellence he &s;ees in the Me|thod
of Fluxions, and con&s;equently cannot
ju&s;tly be &s;aid to <HI>yield Faith</HI> to the Inventor
of that Method. But this whole &s;ection &s;eems
<PB N="7" REF="14">
to me to be matter of &s;ecret hi&s;tory and de|clamation
of the wor&s;t &s;ort, namely, the de|famatory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<P>VI. More &s;ecret hi&s;tory and declamation,
partly about what no body denies, and part|ly
about what no body believes. You give
us to under&s;tand, <HI>you have a right to examine
Fluxions, even though Religion were quite un|concerned,
and though you had no end to &s;erve
but Truth.</HI> No body di&s;putes your right of
examining: but &s;urely no good can be ex|pected
from the examination of a Per&s;on
who has any end to &s;erve but Truth, let that
end be what it will. But pray what is this
other end, this end different from Truth, that
you have to &s;erve? It looks as if Religion
were meant. But I hope better things of
you, a Chri&s;tian, and a Preacher of the Go|&s;pel.
Truth and the Chri&s;tian Religion are
one. I profe&s;s I am greatly puzzled. <HI>I have
taken as much pains</HI> to under&s;tand this pa&s;&s;age
as, I &s;incerely believe, you <HI>have done to make
&s;en&s;e of Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton'<HI>s principles.</HI> A
friend of mine is of opinion the pa&s;&s;age has
been corrupted either by the tran&s;cribers or
the printer, and bids me for <HI>Religion</HI> read
<HI>Promotion. Ita legendum cen&s;eo,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>re|clamantibus</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="15">
<HI>centum</HI> Ton&s;onis. I am apt to
think he is in the right, partly becau&s;e I take
him to be a very able Critick, and partly be|cau&s;e
this emendation, though con&s;iderably
differing from the vulgar reading, &s;erves to
confirm the proof I had before given, that
your end was neither Truth nor Religion.</P>
<P>You tell me I am very angry, and refer to
page 13 and 14 of my Defen&s;e. I have
looked over tho&s;e pages to &s;ee what &s;igns of
anger I have there &s;hown, what injury, what
affront I have there offered you. All I can
find is, that I have propo&s;ed to you the ex|ample
of our Saviour and of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> I
beg your pardon, Sir: I took you for one of
their followers.</P>
<P><HI>You will not take upon you to &s;ay you know
me to be a Minute Philo&s;opher.</HI> I am much
obliged to you for this tenderne&s;s, and &s;hould
be more &s;o, if it appeared that you knew &s;o
much as one letter of my name. But it
&s;eems, you would not be concerned if others
&s;hould take me to be &s;uch a one. You &s;peak
of <HI>my &s;pleen again&s;t the Clergy</HI>; and you tell
me <HI>the Minute Philo&s;ophers make ju&s;t &s;uch com|pliments
as I do to our Church.</HI> Here I appre|hend
you mi&s;take the compliments I make
to your&s;elf, and a few of your credulous
<PB N="9" REF="16">
friends, for compliments to the body of the
Clergy. I a&s;&s;ure you, I look upon the body
of the Clergy as a body of learned and u&s;e|ful
men. I know and am known to a great
many individuals among them, whom I
highly e&s;teem and honour: I have &s;poke of
&s;ome of them in my Defence with &s;ingular
re&s;pect. If I laugh at any, it is at &s;uch as
think you do &s;ervice to the Church in wri|ting
the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI>: If I di&s;like any, they are
&s;uch as are perpetually gra&s;ping at dominion
and riches. No wonder. I am a Layman.
If the Clergy obtain more power, I &s;hall
have le&s;s liberty: If they will have more
wealth, I am one of tho&s;e mu&s;t pay to it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<P>VII. The chief purport of this &s;ection
&s;eems to be to &s;trengthen the proof you had
before given of the infidelity of Mathema|ticians.
You had told us in the <HI>Analy&s;t,</HI><HI>you were not a &s;tranger to it: It was known:
You were credibly informed.</HI> Now you go far|ther.
<HI>You make no doubt of it: You have &s;een
&s;hrewed &s;igns: You have been</HI> VERY <HI>credibly in|formed.</HI>
Can any thing be plainer? I declare
my&s;elf fully &s;atisfied with this proof, even
without the &s;tory told you by Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI>
of <HI>a witty man who was an Infidel,</HI> becau&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="17">
of <HI>the infidelity of a certain noted Mathema|tician.</HI>
Surely this witty man was in je&s;t; at
lea&s;t he was no wi&s;e man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8-10" TYPE="section">
<P>VIII, IX, X. In the&s;e three &s;ections I
meet with nothing but declamation. The
&s;ubject of it is <HI>my pa&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, my
railing and raging, my rhetorick</HI> and writing
<HI>tragedy</HI>; your own &s;incerity and laudable en|deavours

<P>XVII. You begin this &s;ection with ad|dre&s;&s;ing
your &s;elf to me in the following
manner. "I have &s;aid (and I venture &s;till to
<PB N="15" REF="22">
&s;ay) that a fluxion is incomprehen&s;ible:
That &s;econd, third and fourth fluxions
are yet more incomprehen&s;ible: That it is
not po&s;&s;ible to conceive a &s;imple infinite|&s;imal:
That it is yet le&s;s po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive
an infinite&s;imal of an infinite&s;imal,
and &s;o onward. What have you to &s;ay to
this?" Truly very little. Only I don't
well comprehend, how one incomprehen&s;i|ble
can be MORE incomprehen&s;ible than
another incomprehen&s;ible: How it can po&s;|&s;ibly
be LESS po&s;&s;ible to conceive one thing
than to conceive another thing, which other
thing it is not at all po&s;&s;ible to conceive.</P>
<P>For clearing up the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions I have had
recour&s;e, pur&s;uant to your directions, to the
fourth &s;ection of the Analy&s;t, which is the
only one relating to fluxions, of the three
you refer me to. But all the &s;atisfaction I
there meet with is, That <HI>your imagination is
very much &s;trained and puzzled</HI> with one
thing; That <HI>it &s;eems &s;till more difficult to con|ceive</HI>
another thing; That a third <HI>&s;eems an

mi&s;take not, all human under&s;tanding</HI>; That
<HI>take</HI> another <HI>in what light one plea&s;es, the
clear conception of it will, if you mi&s;take not,
be found impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> This to me &s;eems to
<PB N="16" REF="23">
amount to thus much. The Author of the
<HI>Minute Philo&s;opher</HI> cannot comprehend the
principles of fluxions: Therefore no man
living can comprehend them. He cannot
under&s;tand them: Therefore they exceed
all human under&s;tanding. A notable proof
of my Hypothe&s;is, that that Gentleman has
too good an opinion of him&s;elf, and too
mean a one of all other men.</P>
<P>You go on addre&s;&s;ing your &s;elf to me;
<HI>Do you attempt to clear up the notion of a
fluxion? Nothing like it.</HI> Very true, nor did
I ever undertake it. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has
done it incomparably well to tho&s;e who are
qualified to read his Works, and thither I
refer you. May not I expo&s;e your blunders,
without pretending to explain his doctrine
better than he has done it him&s;elf?</P>
<P>But you tell me, <HI>I only a&s;&s;ure you (upon my
bare word) from my own experience, and that
of &s;everal others whom I could name, that the
doctrine of fluxions may be clearly conceived and
di&s;tinctly comprehended.</HI> Why pray, Sir, what
did you require more? <HI>You appealed to the
trial of every thinking reader.</HI> I am one of
your <HI>thinking readers.</HI> I have made the <HI>trial</HI>
you de&s;ired. I acquaint you with the re&s;ult
of that <HI>trial,</HI> and all the return you make
<PB N="17" REF="24">
me is, <HI>Can you think I will take your word
when I refu&s;e to take your Ma&s;ter's?</HI> I appeal
to all my thinking readers whether this be
civil u&s;age. You &s;ay, you don't under&s;tand
fluxions. I &s;ay I do. I believe you: And
yet you won't believe me.</P>
<P>This, Sir, my judgment tells me is all the
an&s;wer I ought to make to the invitations you
&s;o frequently give me upon this head. I am
&s;en&s;ible it were better to hold &s;o &s;lippery an
adver&s;ary to the points we have already in
hand, than before the&s;e are &s;ettled, to go up|on
new matter. Be&s;ides, I am afraid of incur|ring
the common fate of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s
interpreters, to be le&s;s intelligible than my
Ma&s;ter. I apprehend likewi&s;e that, let me
take ever &s;o much pains to &s;atisfy and oblige
you, I &s;hall meet with no better u&s;age than
when you appealed to me: That all the re|turn
I am to expect is, <HI>Alas! I find no &s;en&s;e
or rea&s;on in what you &s;ay.</HI> And yet I am &s;o
de&s;irous of contributing my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to|wards
your laudable de&s;ign of <HI>putting this
controver&s;y in &s;uch a light as that every reader
may judge thereof,</HI> that I think I mu&s;t run
that hazard. But I de&s;ire it may be remem|bred
that I do not here intend, nor indeed
think my &s;elf at all qualified to write a com|plete

treati&s;e of Fluxions, that being ex|pected
from better hands. All that you re|quire
of me is to &s;hew that the principles of
Fluxions may be clearly conceived. This
therefore is what I &s;hall endeavour to do, and
in order to render tho&s;e principles as intelli|gible

<P N="1">1. While the generating point is in mo|tion

increa&s;es, while the generating point
is moving in the direction <HI>AB,</HI> and perpe|tually

is called the fluxion of the flowing

the increment of the flowing line <HI>AC</HI>;
and in the &s;econd ca&s;e is called the decrement
of the flowing line <HI>Ac.</HI></P>

<PB N="21" REF="28">
in&s;tant of time that it &s;ets out or departs from
the point <HI>C,</HI> at that very in&s;tant of time an
increment begins to be generated, or begins
to exi&s;t, which therefore is properly called a
na&s;cent increment. And as the generating
point at that in&s;tant of time is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
ju&s;t &s;etting out, and not as yet to have moved
to the lea&s;t imaginable di&s;tance from the
point <HI>C,</HI> nor con&s;equently to have generated
the lea&s;t imaginable increment, it is plain that
the na&s;cent increment here con&s;idered will
be le&s;s than any quantity that can be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>In like manner when the generating point
returns back from <HI>c</HI> to <HI>C,</HI> in order to annihi|late

continually grow le&s;s and le&s;s, will become

to conceive them. When thou ha&s;t done
this, then wilt thou be rightly prepared for
under&s;tanding the following fundamental
propo&s;ition, upon which Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>

whole bu&s;ine&s;s of which Method is, from
the proportion between the Fluxions, or be|tween
the na&s;cent increments, of flowing

<DIV2 TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>The Fluxions, or Velocities, of flowing

of tho&s;e flowing quantities, generated in very

that the na&s;cent increments mu&s;t be exactly
as the velocities with which they begin to be
generated. <HI>Q. E. D.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve to
you, that if Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> had proceeded
no farther than the fir&s;t part of this propo&s;i|tion,
and had contented him&s;elf with e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
the proportion between the incre|ments
and their velocities very nearly, with|out
going to the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s, yet his
Method had been no le&s;s &s;cientifical and no
le&s;s demon&s;trative than it now is. Con&s;e|quently
you were very much over&s;een in
charging him and his followers with pro|ceeding
blindfold, and not knowing what
they were doing, even though you had &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="24" REF="31">
in proving that his Method did not
come up to the rigor of Geometry.</P>
<P>To prevent cavils, I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve
that the third part of this demon&s;tration
might ea&s;ily be put into a more diffu&s;ive
form, and might be deduced &s;tep by &s;tep
from the <HI>Methodus rationum primarum &amp; ul|timarum.</HI>
But this at pre&s;ent is no way ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
e&s;pecially as you admit the propo&s;i|tion
to be true. All that I have to do there|fore
is to explain it a little more particularly,
and this I &s;hall be the more careful in doing;
becau&s;e this proportion of na&s;cent or evane|&s;cent
increments is what I apprehend, you
are &s;o often plea&s;ed to call a proportion be|tween
nothings. With what ju&s;tice you do
&s;o the Reader may ea&s;ily judge, if he gives
him&s;elf the trouble of con&s;idering what
follows.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, and above all, it is here
to be diligently attended to, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI> no where &s;ettles or determines the
magnitude of na&s;cent or evane&s;cent incre|ments
any farther than to &s;ay it is le&s;s than
any finite magnitude. On the contrary, he
expre&s;ly declares that their magnitude can|not
be a&s;&s;igned or determined. Nor indeed
has he any occa&s;ion to determine their mag|nitude,
<PB N="25" REF="32">
but only the proportion between
them, this being all that is requi&s;ite in his
Method.</P>
<P>Now the proportion between two evane|&s;cent
increments is ea&s;ily to be conceived,
though the ab&s;olute magnitude of tho&s;e in|crements
is utterly imperceptible to the ima|gination.
For tho&s;e increments may be ex|pounded
or repre&s;ented by any two finite
quantities bearing the &s;ame proportion to
one another: And as the&s;e finite quantities
may be clearly conceived, the proportion
between them may likewi&s;e be clearly con|ceived,
<HI>i. e.</HI> the proportion of the evane|&s;cent
increments may be clearly conceived
by this means. Of this &s;everal examples
may be found in Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s <HI>Methodus ratio|num
primarum &amp; ultimarum,</HI> and one in imi|tation
of him may be &s;een in this Letter, Sect.
XXXII.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, I come now to il|lu&s;trate
and explain the Propo&s;ition, to
which end I &s;hall make u&s;e of the following
ea&s;y example.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33"><FIGURE>

Let the right

line <HI>AbB,</HI> di|vided
into two
equal parts in

revolve about

even or uneven, remove into the &s;ituation
<HI>AcC.</HI> Then will the points <HI>B</HI> and <HI>b</HI> de&s;cribe
the circular arcs <HI>BC, bc:</HI> The velocity of
the point <HI>B</HI> will be always double of the ve|locity
of the point <HI>b:</HI> The arc <HI>BC</HI> will be
double of the arc <HI>bc:</HI> And the increment
<HI>BD</HI> will be double of the increment <HI>bd.</HI>
In all this there is no difficulty between us.</P>
<P>I &s;ay farther, The na&s;cent or evane&s;cent
increment of the arc <HI>BC</HI> is double of the
na&s;cent or evane&s;cent increment of the arc
<HI>bc.</HI> This you won't under&s;tand. I explain
it thus, beginning fir&s;t with the na&s;cent in|crements.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the line <HI>AbB</HI> begins to revolve
upon the point <HI>A,</HI> and thereby begins to de|part
from the &s;ituation <HI>AbB</HI>; at that in&s;tant
of time do the points <HI>B</HI> and <HI>b</HI> begin to gene|rate
their &s;everal increments. And as the
velocity of the point <HI>B</HI> is always double of
the velocity of the point <HI>b,</HI> it is manife&s;t that
<PB N="27" REF="34">
the increment of the arc <HI>BC</HI> begins to be
generated with twice the velocity that the
increment of the arc <HI>bc</HI> begins to be gene|rated
with; <HI>i.e.</HI> that the na&s;cent increment
of <HI>BC</HI> is generated with twice the velocity
that the na&s;cent increment of <HI>bc</HI> is generated
with; and con&s;equently that the former
na&s;cent increment is by this propo&s;ition
double of the latter na&s;cent increment.</P>
<P>To come now to the evane&s;cent incre|ments,
let us &s;uppo&s;e the line <HI>AbB</HI> to have
removed into the &s;ituation <HI>AdD</HI> very near
to <HI>AbB,</HI> whereby the increments <HI>BD, bd</HI>
have been generated. Next let us imagine
the line <HI>AbD</HI> to return gradually to its fir&s;t
&s;ituation <HI>AbB,</HI> and thereby let the incre|ments
<HI>BD, bd</HI> grow continually le&s;s and
le&s;s, and at la&s;t entirely vani&s;h and become
nothing. Then as the fir&s;t of the&s;e two incre|ments
is double of the &s;econd, and decrea&s;es
twice as fa&s;t as the &s;econd, it mu&s;t perpe|tually
bear the &s;ame proportion to the &s;e|cond;
and con&s;equently the la&s;t proportion
of the&s;e two increments, their proportion at
the in&s;tant of evane&s;cence will be the &s;ame as
at fir&s;t, namely that of 2 to 1. You tell
me, when they vani&s;h, they become nothing.
I allow it. You &s;ay, to talk of a proportion
<PB N="28" REF="35">
between nothings is to talk non&s;en&s;e. I a|gree
with you. But their la&s;t proportion is
not their proportion after they are vani&s;hed
and are become nothing: It is their propor|tion
when they vani&s;h: It is the proportion
with which they vani&s;h.</P>
<P>You will tell me, perhaps, this is unintel|ligible.
I expect it. I ask you therefore,
which vani&s;hes fir&s;t? The increments them|&s;elves?
Or the proportion between them?
I think, Sir, even you will not venture to &s;ay,
that the increments vani&s;h before their pro|portion
vani&s;hes; or that the proportion va|ni&s;hes
before the increments vani&s;h. If &s;o;
we are agreed thus far, that the increments
vani&s;h and their proportion vani&s;hes at one
and the &s;ame in&s;tant of time. This propor|tion
therefore which vani&s;hes at the &s;ame in|&s;tant
of time that the increments vani&s;h, is
the proportion with which the increments
vani&s;h, or, in other words, is the la&s;t pro|portion
of the evane&s;cent increments.</P>
<P>This, I hope, will appear &s;ufficiently
clear to an attentive Reader: But for his
farther &s;atisfaction I &s;hall beg leave to lay
before him another example.</P>
<P>Let the point <HI>A</HI> with a given uniform ve|locity
de&s;cribe or generate the flowing line <FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="36">
</FIGURE>
<HI>AB:</HI> And let the point <HI>D</HI> with a velocity
continually increa&s;ing de&s;cribe or generate
the flowing line <HI>DE:</HI> Al&s;o let both points
arrive at the line <HI>CF,</HI> (cutting the two flow|ing
lines) at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, and
with velocities exactly equal.</P>
<P>Then it is plain, that if we take two in|crements
<HI>Ff, Cc,</HI> generated in the &s;ame
particle of time, <HI>Ff</HI> will a little exceed <HI>Cc.</HI>
But if we &s;uppo&s;e the generating points to
return towards the line <HI>CF,</HI> and their re|&s;pective
velocities in every point of the incre|ments
<HI>Ff, Cc,</HI> to be the very &s;ame in re|turning
as they had been before in proceed|ing
from the line <HI>CF</HI>; it is manife&s;t that the
more the increments are dimini&s;hed by the
gradual return of the generating points to|wards
the line <HI>CF,</HI> the nearer will the pro|portion
between them approach to that of a
perfect equality. This is ea&s;ily conceived,
and admits of no di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Farther, if the generating points be &s;uppo&s;ed
to return exactly to the line <HI>CF,</HI> and there|by
<PB N="30" REF="37">
by the increments vani&s;h and become no|thing;
the ratio with which the increments
vani&s;h into nothing, or the la&s;t proportion
of the evane&s;cent increments, will be that of
a perfect equality. For, as during the time
that the generating points are returning to|wards
the line <HI>CF,</HI> the increments <HI>Ff, Cc</HI>
are continually more and more dimini&s;hed,
and the velocities with which the increments
decrea&s;e, approach more and more to the
ratio of equality; &s;o at the in&s;tant of time
that tho&s;e points actually arrive at the line
<HI>CF,</HI> at that &s;ame in&s;tant the increments en|tirely
vani&s;h, and at the very &s;ame in&s;tant
the velocities with which they decrea&s;e
and in decrea&s;ing vani&s;h, arrive at the ra|tio
of perfect equality: which therefore is
the ratio of the velocities with which the in|crements
vani&s;h, and con&s;equently, by this
propo&s;ition, is the ratio of the evane&s;cent
increments.</P>
<P>It is to be carefully attended to, that the
proportion here given as the proportion of
the evane&s;cent increments, is not their pro|portion
before they vani&s;h. For then <HI>Ff</HI>
will exceed <HI>Cc.</HI> Nor is it their proportion
after they have vani&s;hed. For then they are
become nothing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> proportion.
<PB N="31" REF="38">
But it is their proportion at the in&s;tant that
they vani&s;h, or the proportion with which
they vani&s;h.</P>
<P>I might ob&s;erve farther, that as the incre|ments
do not come to this proportion before
they vani&s;h, &s;o neither do they vani&s;h before
they come to this proportion: but at one and
the &s;ame in&s;tant of time they come to this
proportion and vani&s;h, they vani&s;h and come
to this proportion. But I am now afraid I
have taken up too much of my reader's
time in explaining a point &s;ufficiently clear
before.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="42">
notice of as a pious art of mi&s;leading and
confounding your reader, in&s;tead of in&s;truct|ing
him, and had put the two following
que&s;tions to you, which I &s;hall here tran|&s;cribe
at large; becau&s;e with another pious
art you have thought fit to truncate the one,
and to leave out the other, for particular
rea&s;ons which I &s;hall by and by lay before
the reader. Where, &s;aid I, do you find
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as
<HI>the velocities of the velocities, the &s;econd,
third and fourth velocities, the incipient ce|lerity
of an incipient celerity, the na&s;cent aug|ment

<P>To the&s;e two Que&s;tions you are &s;en&s;ible
it is incumbent upon you to &s;eem to give an

<P>In the fir&s;t place you curtail my fir&s;t que|&s;tion,
cutting off the latter part of it with an

one of your definitions, and that the lea&s;t
ju&s;tifiable of them all, namely <HI>the incipient</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="43">
<HI>celerity of an incipient celerity.</HI> There's one
difficulty cleverly got over.</P>
<P>In the next place you entirely cut off my
&s;econd que&s;tion. In which I find you have
two advantages. The fir&s;t is to avoid giving
an an&s;wer to it. The &s;econd, not to let your

which I had in&s;erted into that que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But &s;etting all this a&s;ide, after you have

what an&s;wer do you give to it? Do you
&s;hew me where Sir <HI>I. N.</HI> u&s;es &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions?
No. You don't pretend to it. What
then? Why truly you endeavour to &s;hew,
by comparing together two independent Pa&s;|&s;ages
taken from two different treati&s;es of
Sir <HI>I. N.</HI> that you may ju&s;tifiably call a &s;e|cond

&s;hew that a definition of your own may be

<P><PB N="37" REF="44">
In order to get out of this <HI>Egyptian</HI> dark|ne&s;s

<P>That great Man making u&s;e of the liberty
which has always been allowed to Inventors,
of giving new names to new conceptions,
and of defining tho&s;e names as they thought
fit, has been plea&s;ed to call by the name of
fluxion, the velocity with which a flowing
quantity increa&s;es or decrea&s;es. If this velo|city
do not always continue the &s;ame, but
undergo any change, the velocity of that
change is called a fluxion of a fluxion, or a &s;e|cond
fluxion; and as the change is &s;wifter or
&s;lower, the &s;econd fluxion is &s;aid to be greater
<PB N="38" REF="45">
or le&s;s. For in&s;tance, if the fir&s;t fluxion or
velocity of the flowing quantity continually
increa&s;e, the &s;econd fluxion is the velocity
with which the fir&s;t velocity increa&s;es, and
is proportional to the momentaneous increa&s;e
of that fir&s;t velocity.</P>
<P>In like manner the third fluxion is the ve|locity
of the change of the &s;econd fluxion;
the fourth fluxion is the velocity of the
change of the third; the fifth the velocity
of the change of the fourth, <HI>&amp;c. ad infini|tum.</HI></P>
<P>Here perhaps it may not be ami&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the reader's imagination by repre&s;enting the
proportions betwen fluxions of all the &s;everal
orders in a &s;en&s;ible manner. I &s;ay their pro|portions:
for, as I &s;aid before, Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI> makes no enquiry into, nor ever
con&s;iders the ab&s;olute magnitude of fluxions,
or moments, or na&s;cent increments, but on|ly
the proportion between them. And this
I de&s;ire may be carefully remembred.</P>

<P>XXIV, XXV, XXVI. I do not remem|ber

plentifully di&s;per&s;ed all over the

<P>To this I had replied, Fir&s;t, that this
omi&s;&s;ion, at the wor&s;t, could not cau&s;e them

quantity, in computing the mo&s;t immen&s;e

magnitude: Secondly, that as they clearly
&s;aw and could plainly demon&s;trate this in&s;ig|nificancy
of the omi&s;&s;ion, they could not
ju&s;tly be &s;aid to proceed blindfold: Thirdly,
that this pretended error or omi&s;&s;ion of theirs
was only a blunder of your own.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, you &s;pend three &s;ections

that the main &s;tre&s;s of my defence of Sir

error of theirs is <HI>of no &s;ignificancy in practice</HI>;
without taking the lea&s;t notice of the &s;econd

<P>One of them indeed could make nothing
of what I had &s;aid about the length of a
&s;ubtangent, or the magnitude of the orb of
the fixed &s;tars; but was fully &s;atisfied by
the information given him by one of his ac|quaintance
to the following effect. The
Author of the Minute Philo&s;opher has found
out that, if Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> were to mea|&s;ure
the height of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church by
Fluxions, he would be out about three quar|ters
of a hair's breadth: But yonder is one
<HI>Philalethes</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who pretends that
Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> would not be out above the tenth
part of a hair's breadth. Hearing this, and
that two books had been written in this
controver&s;y, the hone&s;t Gentleman flew in|to
a great pa&s;&s;ion, and after muttering &s;ome|thing
to him&s;elf about &s;ome body's being
<PB N="44" REF="51">
overpaid, he went on making reflections,
which I don't care to repeat, as not being
much for your honour or mine, any more
than for that of another per&s;on, whom I too
highly reverence to name upon this occa&s;ion.</P>

My antagoni&s;t <HI>intreats you to ob&s;erve how
fairly I proceed.</HI> I de&s;ire you to be upon
your guard, to look well about you. After
this, if either of us endeavour to throw du&s;t

to the <HI>Liffy</HI> with him, pump him, duck
him for a Pickpocket. The di&s;pute here is
about a matter of fact, and I will endeavour
to &s;tate the ca&s;e &s;o plainly, that it &s;hall be
impo&s;&s;ible either to mi&s;take or to evade it.</P>
<P>In Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s demon&s;tration of
the rule for finding the moment of the re|ctangle
of two flowing quantities, mention
is made of three &s;everal rectangles, to each
of which the flowing rectangle is equal, at
<PB N="45" REF="52">
three different times, or in three different
&s;tates.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the rectangle <HI>A</HI>&plus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&plus;&frac12;<HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved, Sir, that you were mi|&s;taken
in taking it for granted, that what
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was endeavouring to find
by the &s;uppo&s;itions made in this demon&s;tra|tion,
was the increment of the &s;econd of
the&s;e rectangles, the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> The
rea&s;on I gave for &s;uppo&s;ing you in a mi&s;take,
was expre&s;&s;ed in the following words. "For
neither in the demon&s;tration it &s;elf, nor
in any thing preceding or following it,
is any mention &s;o much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI>" This
therefore is a matter of fact that you di&s;pute
with me: But how you di&s;pute it, is worth
ob&s;erving. It greatly imports you to con|tradict
me, and yet you cannot, you dare
not contradict what I &s;ay. Notwith&s;tanding
this you will contradict me. Methinks I &s;ee

And yet I &s;peak the words of truth

to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and detect you. But you
can fir&s;t alter what I &s;ay, and then contra|dict
me. In&s;tead of my words alone, you can
give the reader other words which are not

every reader &s;hall take them for mine; and
then you can <HI>affirm the direct contrary.</HI> You

you can affirm that he makes mention of the

makes expre&s;s mention of the increment of
<HI>&s;uch rectangle:</HI> Of the increment of <HI>that
rectangle who&s;e &s;ides have</HI> a <HI>and</HI> b <HI>for their

is not therefore about what Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>

what he under&s;tands, but what he
declares: Not about his &s;en&s;e, but his
words. And in all his words throughout
this demon&s;tration and every thing prece|ding
and following it, I affirm and aver that
he does not &s;o much as once mention the in|crement
of the rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> Deny it, if

<P>XXVIII. You tell me, <HI>I would fain per|plex
this plain ca&s;e by di&s;tingui&s;hing between an</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="55">
<HI>increment and a moment. But it is evident
to every one, who has any notion of demon&s;tra|tion,
that the</HI> incrementum <HI>in the conclu&s;ion
mu&s;t be the</HI> momentum <HI>in the Lemma; and
to &s;uppo&s;e it otherwi&s;e is no credit to the Author.</HI>
Now, Sir, to &s;hew you how little I am in|clined
to <HI>perplex the ca&s;e,</HI> I hereby declare
that I ab&s;olutely and fully agree with you
that the <HI>incrementum</HI> in the conclu&s;ion is the
<HI>momentum</HI> in the Lemma. Let us now &s;ee
whither this our agreement will lead us.</P>
<P>The <HI>momentum</HI> in the Lemma we both
agree to be the <HI>momentum</HI> of the rectangle
<HI>AB.</HI> The <HI>incrementum</HI> in the conclu&s;ion
is manife&s;tly the exce&s;s of the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>&plus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&plus;&frac12;<HI>b,</HI> above the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>b,</HI> i.e. the increment of the
rectangle <HI>A</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>b.</HI> Therefore we
are agreed that the moment of the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> is the increment of the rectangle
<HI>A</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>b.</HI> Con&s;equently you were
mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that the moment of
the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> was the increment of the
&s;ame rectangle <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>You quote Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s words a|gain&s;t
me to &s;hew that a moment is an in|crement
or decrement. Why Sir! You
make me &s;tare. Did not I plainly tell you
<PB N="49" REF="56">
in my defence that the moment of <HI>AB</HI>
was an increment? Did not I likewi&s;e tell
you what increment it was, namely the in|crement
of <HI>A</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;&frac12;<HI>b</HI>? If you will
be plea&s;ed to put on your mathematical
&s;pectacles, or rather to put on the ingenuity
of a Scholar and a Gentleman, (for your
eyes are good enough) you will plainly &s;ee
that the di&s;tinction I make, is not between a
moment in general and an increment in ge|neral,
but between a particular moment and
a particular increment, between the mo|ment

of the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> i.e. the exce&s;s of the

<HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve me well, Sir, what I have affirm|ed,
and what I &s;till affirm, and what before
I have done, I &s;hall prove pa&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility
of being denied, is this. The moment of
<HI>AB</HI> is neither the increment nor the decre|ment
of <HI>AB</HI>; neither the exce&s;s of <HI>A</HI>&plus;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&plus;<HI>b</HI> above <HI>AB</HI>; nor the defect of <HI>A</HI>&minus;<HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>B</HI>&minus;<HI>b</HI> from <HI>AB.</HI> This &s;eems to you <HI>a won|derful</HI>
a&s;&s;ertion. But one of yours, which
you call a <HI>very plain and ea&s;y</HI> one, is to me
much more wonderful.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57">
I a&s;ked, which of the&s;e two quantities,
the increment of <HI>AB,</HI> or the decrement of
<HI>AB,</HI> you would be plea&s;ed to call the mo|ment
of <HI>AB</HI>? Your an&s;wer is, <HI>Either of
them.</HI> This to me is a very wonderful an|&s;wer
for &s;o great and &s;o accurate a Mathema|tician
to make, and if I have not quite for|got
my Logick, I &s;hall draw as wonderful
an inference from it. The moment of <HI>AB</HI>
is equal to the increment of <HI>AB:</HI> The &s;ame
moment of <HI>AB</HI> is equal to the decrement
of <HI>AB. Ergo,</HI> the increment of <HI>AB</HI> is e|qual
to the decrement of <HI>AB.</HI> That is,
<HI>Ab</HI>&plus;<HI>Ba</HI>&plus;<HI>ab</HI>&equals;<HI>Ab</HI>&plus;<HI>Ba</HI>&minus;<HI>ab,</HI> i.e.
2<HI>ab</HI>&equals;<HI>o.</HI> Therefore the rectangle <HI>ab,</HI> a|bout
which the Author of the Minute Phi|lo&s;opher
has made &s;uch a pother, is by his
own confe&s;&s;ion equal to nothing.</P>
<P>Your example in numbers does by no
means come up to our ca&s;e. I &s;hall beg leave
to &s;tate it a little more pertinently. It is a|greed
that all numbers are either odd, or e|ven.
Upon this you pronounce an unknown
number to be even, without giving any rea|&s;on
for it. I repre&s;ent to you that, &s;ince the
number is unknown, it may as well be odd
as even; and therefore to pronounce it either
the one or the other, without any rea&s;on for
<PB N="51" REF="58">
&s;o doing, is no better, and no more like an A|rithmetician,
than to to&s;s up cro&s;s or pile
what you &s;hall call it. You may call this
mirth, if you plea&s;e; but the argument is
not the le&s;s &s;trong again&s;t you for this &s;eem|ing
levity.</P>
<P>Nor is the accommodation I propo&s;ed in
the di&s;pute between an increment and a de|crement
for the title of moment, at all the
le&s;s rea&s;onable for being delivered in a ludi|crous
manner, under which other per&s;ons
can plainly di&s;cern a &s;erious argument, and I
perceive you find it much ea&s;ier to rally than
to an&s;wer that argument. To &s;ay truth,
there is no an&s;wer to be given to it; it is a
demon&s;tration again&s;t you as &s;trong as any in
<HI>Euclid,</HI> that the moment of the rectangle
<HI>AB</HI> is a middle arithmetical proportional
between the increment and decrement of the
&s;ame rectangle <HI>AB.</HI> If &s;o;</P>

<P>XXIX. You are plea&s;ed to take notice
that <HI>I very candidly repre&s;ent my ca&s;e to be that

by this you are duly &s;en&s;ible of my candour.
Had I been le&s;s candid, you &s;ee plainly I had
<PB N="52" REF="59">
a fair occa&s;ion of repre&s;enting another per|&s;on
in that perplexity, who might not have
had a Gho&s;t &s;o ready at hand to help him out.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion with me was, Whether the
velocity of the flowing rectangle <HI>AB</HI> was
the velocity with which the increment, or
the velocity with which the decrement, of
the &s;ame rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> might be generated?
I could &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of a rea&s;on to deter|mine
me either way. This led me to fix up|on
a middle arithmetical proportional be|tween
the&s;e two velocities, for the velocity
of the rectangle <HI>AB:</HI> As I had before &s;hewn
its moment to be a middle arithmetical pro|portional
between the increment and decre|ment.
But you, who talk &s;o much of rea|&s;oning
and logick, and who &s;et up for the
great and &s;ole Ma&s;ter of the <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Geome|trica,
are of opinion that either of the&s;e veloci|ties
may be deemed the velocity</HI> of the rectangle
<HI>AB.</HI> That is, in your opinion, of two un|equal
velocities, either the one, or the other,
may be deemed equal to a third velocity;
or two velocities may be deemed equal and
unequal at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>You tell me, <HI>For your part, in the rectan|gle</HI>
AB <HI>con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, without ei|ther
increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing, you can conceive</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="60">
<HI>no velocity at all.</HI> Nor I neither. But in
the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> con&s;idered as flowing,
whether increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing, I can
conceive &s;ome velocity or other: And if it
flow with an accelerated velocity; I can con|ceive
that velocity to be different in every
point of time: And if we &s;uppo&s;e the incre|ment
of the rectangle to be generated in a
given particle of time, and the decrement of
the &s;ame rectangle to be generated in ano|ther
equal particle of time; I can conceive
the uniform velocity that would generate the
increment in the given time, to exceed the
uniform velocity that would generate the de|crement
in the &s;ame time: And the&s;e two ve|locities
being unequal, I can conceive an a|rithmetical
mean between them; in like
manner as I had before &s;uppo&s;ed an arithme|tical
mean between the increment and decre|ment
of <HI>AB,</HI> which mean is the moment of
<HI>AB:</HI> And la&s;tly, while <HI>AB</HI> flows, I can con|ceive
that the fir&s;t arithmetical mean is con|&s;tantly
proportional to the la&s;t, <HI>i.e.</HI> that the
velocity of <HI>AB</HI> is proportional to the mo|ment
of <HI>AB.</HI></P>
<P>Upon my a&s;&s;erting that the moment of the
rectangle <HI>AB</HI> is neither the increment nor
decrement of that &s;ame rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> you
<PB N="54" REF="61">

I may tell you farther, that the

<P>You &s;eem much at a lo&s;s to conceive how
a na&s;cent increment, a quantity ju&s;t begin|ning
to exi&s;t, but not yet arrived to any a&s;|&s;ignable
magnitude, can be divided or di|&s;tingui&s;hed
into two equal parts. Now to
me there appears no more difficulty in con|ceiving
this, than in apprehending how any
finite quantity is divided or di&s;tingui&s;hed in|to
halves. For na&s;cent quantities may bear
all imaginable proportions to one another, as
well as finite quantities. One example of this
I have already given in &s;ect. 17. p. 27. where
the na&s;cent increments <HI>BD, bd,</HI> bear to
each other the proportion of 2 to 1; and
con&s;equently the na&s;cent increment <HI>bd</HI> is
equal to one half of the na&s;cent increment
<PB N="57" REF="64">
<HI>BD.</HI> And by dividing the revolving line
<HI>AbB</HI> into any other a&s;&s;ignable parts, it is
very ea&s;y to conceive what number one
plea&s;es of na&s;cent increments bearing any
a&s;&s;ignable proportions to one another.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible you may be &s;o exceedingly
&s;crupulous as to object that, though a mo|ment
as <HI>bd,</HI> is here &s;hewn to be equal to
half of another moment <HI>BD,</HI> yet &s;till this
does not come up to the ca&s;e of Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton's</HI> demon&s;tration, where one mo|ment
is &s;uppo&s;ed not only to be double of
another, as in this ca&s;e, but to be actually
divided into two equal parts. I am willing
to have all po&s;&s;ible regard for the tenderne&s;s
and delicacy of your under&s;tanding in con|ceiving
any thing that makes again&s;t you,
and therefore &s;hall readily you give the be&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance I can towards overcoming this dif|ficulty
likewi&s;e. And perhaps it may be
mo&s;t ea&s;y to your imagination, if we fir&s;t
&s;uppo&s;e our moments to be finite quantities,
and afterwards to become evane&s;cent, as
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> generally does, and ob|&s;erves
to be agreeable to the geometry of
the ancients.</P>
<P>Let therefore the line <HI>AC</HI> be bi&s;ected in
the point <HI>B,</HI> and at a given in&s;tant of time <FIGURE>
<PB N="58" REF="65">

let a point &s;et out from <HI>A</HI> to de&s;cribe the
line <HI>AC</HI> with any given velocity. It is plain
this point will arrive at <HI>C</HI> in a given time.
Let another point at the &s;ame given in&s;tant
of time &s;et out from <HI>B</HI> with one half of the
former velocity, to de&s;cribe the line <HI>BC.</HI>
Then will this &s;econd point arrive at <HI>C</HI> in
the &s;ame given time as the fir&s;t point will
arrive there. Now let us &s;uppo&s;e the lines
<HI>AC, BC,</HI> to be gradually de&s;troyed by this
motion of their re&s;pective de&s;cribing points
<HI>A</HI> and <HI>B.</HI> It is manife&s;t that the&s;e lines will
be to one another as 2 to 1, not only at the
fir&s;t, but all the time they are dimini&s;hing.
And as by the approach of the points <HI>A</HI> and
<HI>B</HI> to the point <HI>C</HI> the&s;e lines will be dimi|ni&s;hed
<HI>&s;ine fine,</HI> and will at la&s;t vani&s;h into
nothing by the actual arrival of tho&s;e points

will &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them to the in&s;tant
of their evane&s;cence, and even at that very in|&s;tant.
Here then we have the evane&s;cent
line <HI>AB</HI> actually divided into two equal

<P>And here, I own, you have fairly gra|velled

great a perplexity, as when my hunger was
equally divided between the two bottles of

What then can be done? I had, I thought,

a moment was, but to prevent, as far as
po&s;&s;ible, all mi&s;takes about it, I had mo&s;t
carefully and circum&s;pectly &s;hown what it
was not. Since that account was publi&s;hed,
I had ob&s;erved &s;everal per&s;ons to be greatly

<P>I hope, by this time, Sir, you may have
di&s;covered &s;ome <HI>&s;en&s;e and rea&s;on in what I &s;ay</HI>
in my account of a moment: but if you can|not
or will not di&s;cover any, I flatter my&s;elf
the reader both will and can. And having
now a figure before me, I &s;hall take the op|portunity
<PB N="68" REF="75">
of &s;hewing you, that there is &s;ome

mu&s;t <HI>Lq</HI> be le&s;s than the moment: And if
the moment be equal to <HI>Lq,</HI> then mu&s;t <HI>Lt</HI>

them can never be equal to the moment?

<P>Things &s;tanding thus, I offer this argu|ment

to you, I may take <HI>Lt</HI> for the moment
of <HI>RL</HI>; and &s;ince, according to you I may
likewi&s;e take <HI>Lq</HI> for the moment of <HI>RL</HI>;
it is manife&s;t that, according to you, I may
take <HI>Lt</HI> and <HI>Lq</HI> added together for twice
the moment of <HI>RL.</HI> Con&s;equently, accord|ing
to you, I may take the half of <HI>Lt</HI> and
the half of <HI>Lq</HI> added together for the
moment of <HI>RL,</HI> i.e. I may take <HI>r&s;</HI>; for the
moment of <HI>RL.</HI> I hope I may now be al|lowed
to &s;ay, "Believe me there is no re|medy,
you mu&s;t acquie&s;ce."</P>
<Q>&mdash;Fru&s;tra cerno te tendere contra.</Q>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you may now compre|hend
my meaning, when I &s;ay, that the mo|ment
of <HI>AB</HI> is not the increment of <HI>AB,</HI>
tho' I allow the moment of <HI>AB</HI> to be an in|crement,
agreeably to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s
definition of the word moment. But &s;till it
is po&s;&s;ible, you may doubt whether the &s;en&s;e
I a&s;&s;ign to the word moment, be Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton</HI>'s &s;en&s;e of that term, or a new one that
<PB N="70" REF="77">
I have affixed to it in oppo&s;ition to you.
This is the next point to be cleared up.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave to ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t
place, the pre&s;umption is &s;trong in my fa|vour,
that by the moment of <HI>AB</HI> Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>
means &s;omething different from the incre|ment
of <HI>AB.</HI> For if the&s;e two words &s;igni|fied
preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, it is probable
he would have u&s;ed them indifferently,
&s;ometimes the one and &s;ometimes the other.
Whereas the fact is, that, after he has done
with defining his terms, he never mentions
the word increment but in one place, and
then he does not &s;peak of the increment of
the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> but only of the increment
of the rectangle, <HI>i.e.</HI> of the flowing rectan|gle
taken at large. But where he names his
rectangle, or other flowing quantity, as <HI>AB,</HI>
<HI>ABC, A</HI>^2, <HI>A</HI>^3, &amp;c. He never mentions
the increment of <HI>AB,</HI> of <HI>ABC,</HI> of <HI>A</HI>^2, &amp;c.
but always the moment of <HI>AB,</HI> the moment
of <HI>ABC,</HI> the moment of <HI>A</HI>^2, of <HI>A</HI>^3, &amp;c.
And when &s;uch a writer as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
chu&s;es con&s;tantly to u&s;e one term, rather than
another &s;eemingly of the &s;ame &s;ignification,
it is to be pre&s;med he has &s;ome rea&s;on for
&s;o doing.</P>
<P>But farther, we are to take notice that, ac|cording
to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> the moment of
<PB N="71" REF="78">
a flowing quantity is ever proportional to the
velocity of the &s;ame flowing quantity. Let
the velocity and the moment of a flowing
quantity vary as they will, yet if any in&s;tant
of time be taken, the&s;e three things will be
given, &s;uch as they are at that &s;ame in&s;tant,
namely, the rectangle it&s;elf, its velocity, and
its moment. And this velocity and moment
are always proportional. If therefore it &s;hall
be &s;hown, that the moment of a flowing
quantity, &s;uch as I &s;uppo&s;e it, is proportio|nal
to the velocity of that &s;ame flowing quan|tity;
it will follow that what I &s;uppo&s;e to
be the moment, is the &s;ame with the mo|ment
intended by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>In order therefore to render the concep|tion
of this point as ea&s;y and as clear as
po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall once more have recour&s;e to
that well known and familiar in&s;tance of a
flowing quantity I have &s;o often made u&s;e of,
<HI>viz.</HI> that of a line de&s;cribed by the motion
of a point.</P>
<P>Let <HI>x</HI> repre&s;ent the time, in which a flow|ing
line is generated, in all the following
ca&s;es, and &s;ince time flows uniformly, let
the con&s;tant quantity <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> repre&s;ent the mo|ment,
or increment, (for in this particular
ca&s;e they are both one) of the time <HI>x.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="79">
Ca&s;e 1. If the velocity of the genera|ting
point be uniform, the flowing line will
be as the time in which it is generated, and
con&s;equently the line may al&s;o be repre&s;ent|ed
by <HI>x,</HI> and its moment or increment may
be repre&s;ented by <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> In this ca&s;e therefore
the moment <HI>x&cmbdot;,</HI> being con&s;tant, mu&s;t be pro|portional
to the velocity, which is likewi&s;e
con&s;tant.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e 2. Let the velocity be equably acce|lerated,
as in the ca&s;e of a falling body ac|cording
to <HI>Galileo</HI>'s Theory. Then will the
velocity be as the time, and con&s;equently
the velocity likewi&s;e may be repre&s;ented by
<HI>x.</HI> And the flowing line being as the time
and velocity jointly, that line may be repre|&s;ented
by <HI>x</HI>^2. Now the &s;uppo&s;ed moment
of this line <HI>x</HI>^2, is 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;,</HI> and I &s;ay, 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI> is
proportional to <HI>x</HI> the velocity of the flow|ing
line. For &s;ince <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> is a con&s;tant quantity,
it is evident that 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI> is as 2<HI>x</HI>; and 2<HI>x</HI> is
as <HI>x.</HI> Therefore 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI> is as <HI>x.</HI> In this ca&s;e
therefore the &s;uppo&s;ed moment is as the ve|locity
of the flowing quantity.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e 3. Let the velocity be as the &s;quare
of the time, and be repre&s;ented by <HI>x</HI>^2. Then
will the flowing line &s;till be as the velocity
<PB N="73" REF="80">
and the time jointly, and con&s;equently may be
repre&s;ented by <HI>x</HI>^3, the &s;uppo&s;ed moment
of which, <HI>viz.</HI> 3<HI>x</HI>^2<HI>x&cmbdot;,</HI> is evidently as <HI>x</HI>^2, or as
the velocity.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e 4. In general, let the velocity be as
any power of the time, and con&s;equently be
repre&s;ented by <HI>x</HI>^<HI>n</HI>^&minus;^1. Then may the flowing
line be repre&s;ented by the time and the velo|city
jointly, or by <HI>x</HI> &times; <HI>x</HI>^<HI>n</HI>^&minus;^1, <HI>i.e.</HI> by <HI>x</HI>^<HI>n.</HI> And
the &s;uppo&s;ed moment of this line will be
<HI>nx</HI>^<HI>n</HI>^&minus;^1<HI>x&cmbdot;,</HI> which is manife&s;tly as <HI>x</HI>^<HI>n</HI>^&minus;^1, that is,
as the velocity.</P>
<P>The moment therefore &s;uppo&s;ed by me
is ever proportional to the velocity, and con|&s;equently
is the moment &s;uppo&s;ed by Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI></P>
<P>While I am upon this con&s;ideration, it
may not be ami&s;s for a more compleat illu|&s;tration
of what we have been talking of,
to con&s;ider a little more particularly the &s;e|cond
ca&s;e, or that of the flowing quantity
<HI>x</HI>^2, an&s;wering to the rectangle <HI>AB</HI> of Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> I &s;hall therefore take the li|berty
of laying before my reader in one
view, the decrement, the moment, and the
increment of the flowing quantity <HI>x</HI>^2, toge|ther

<P>Here it appears that as the moment is a
middle arithmetical proportional between
the decrement and increment; &s;o is the ve|locity
of the flowing line, or the velocity that
would generate the moment in the given
time 2<HI>x&cmbdot;,</HI> a middle arithmetical propor|tional
between the velocities that would re|&s;pectively
generate the decrement and incre|ment
in the &s;ame given time. And this pro|portion
equally holds, whether the mo|ments
be evane&s;cent, or finite quantities of
what&s;oever magnitude.</P>
<P>Whence I infer, that although it were not
po&s;&s;ible to conceive an evane&s;cent moment
divided into two equal parts, yet as finite
ones may be conceived to be &s;o divided, that
demon&s;tration of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s which
you object again&s;t, will &s;till hold firm and
entire, by &s;ub&s;tituting finite moments in the
<PB N="75" REF="82">
room of evane&s;cent moments. Which is a
&s;ecret you were not aware of.</P>
<P>One more ob&s;ervation, and I have done.
You would have us take the increment of
<HI>AB,</HI> or in this ca&s;e the increment of <HI>x</HI>^2, for
the moment of <HI>x</HI>^2; that is, you would have
us take 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI>&plus;<HI>x&cmbdot;x&cmbdot;,</HI> and not 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;,</HI> for the
moment of <HI>x</HI>^2: And yet you allow that the
moment of <HI>x</HI>^2 is proportional to the velo|city
of <HI>x</HI>^2. But the velocity of <HI>x</HI>^2 is <HI>x</HI>; and
the quantity you give us as the moment,
namely 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI>&plus;<HI>x&cmbdot;x&cmbdot;,</HI> is not proportional to
this velocity <HI>x.</HI> Therefore by your own
conce&s;&s;ion, that quantity is not the true mo|ment.
But the quantity that Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>
a&s;&s;igns, namely 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;,</HI> has ju&s;t now been
&s;hown to be proportional to <HI>x,</HI> the velocity
of <HI>x</HI>^2, and therefore is the true moment.
Now therefore I may &s;afely repeat my que|&s;tion,
and <HI>ask with my accu&s;tomed air,</HI>
"What &s;ay you, Sir? Is this a ju&s;t and le|gitimate
rea&s;on for Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s proceeding

it to be &s;o."</P>

<P>XXXI. It is now &s;o evident even to your

<P>XXXII. Before I proceed to vindicate
that a&s;&s;ertion of mine which makes the &s;ub|ject
of this &s;ection, I crave leave to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="81" REF="88">
that this a&s;&s;ertion, true or fal&s;e, is no way
material to the point in debate between us.
You were fully an&s;wered before I laid down
that a&s;&s;ertion: And all the &s;ubterfuges you
have &s;ince made u&s;e of, are clearly removed
before I vindicate it. Why therefore did I
make that a&s;&s;ertion? Dear Sir, the true rea|&s;on
is a &s;ecret. I &s;ee plainly it never entered
your <HI>Pericranium,</HI> any more than that of
&s;ome other per&s;ons much &s;uperior to you
in this part of &s;cience. In due time it may
come out. In the mean while all I &s;hall &s;ay
is, it was made to guard, not again&s;t pre|&s;ent,
but future objections.</P>
<P>Do not mi&s;take me, Sir, I am not going
to excu&s;e that a&s;&s;ertion, much le&s;s to give
it up. I intend to vindicate it to the la&s;t
drop of my pen. Like <HI>Mackbeth</HI> in blood,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;I am in ink</L>
<L>Stept in &s;o far, that &s;hould I wade no more,</L>
<L>Returning were as tedious as go o'er.</L></Q>
<P>My a&s;&s;ertion was, That the moment of
the rectangle <HI>AB,</HI> determined by Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton,</HI> namely <HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA,</HI> and the incre|ment
of the &s;ame rectangle determined by
your &s;elf, namely <HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA</HI>&plus;<HI>ab,</HI> are per|fectly
and exactly equal, &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="89">
to be dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; and this by
<HI>Lemma</HI> 1. <HI>Sect.</HI> 1. <HI>Libr.</HI> 1. <HI>Princip.</HI></P>
<P>You an&s;wer, <HI>If</HI> a <HI>and</HI> b <HI>are real quanti|ties,
then</HI> ab <HI>is &s;omething, and con&s;equently
makes a real difference; but if they are nothing,
then the rectangles whereof they are coefficients,
become nothing likewi&s;e; and con&s;equently the</HI>
momentum <HI>or</HI> incrementum, <HI>whether Sir</HI>
I&s;aac<HI>'s or mine, are in that ca&s;e nothing at
all.</HI></P>
<P>By giving this for an an&s;wer to my a&s;&s;er|tion,
it is plain you have no notion of what
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> means by a quantity being
infinitely dimini&s;hed, though he has &s;o fully
and clearly explained him&s;elf in the <HI>&s;cholium</HI>
of that &s;ection of the <HI>Principia,</HI> which I &s;o
often refer you to.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a given line to be gradually dimi|ni&s;hed,
during a given time, by the conti|nued
motion of a point, &s;o that at the end of
the given time the line would entirely vani&s;h
and become nothing. Then if the motion
of the point, and the gradual diminution
of the line con&s;equent thereupon, be &s;up|po&s;ed
to &s;top before the expiration of the
given time, it is plain that the line will not
as yet have been dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; it
will &s;till be &s;omething, it will be a real
<PB N="83" REF="90">
quantity, it will be a finite quantity. But
if the motion go on, without &s;top or &s;tay, to
the end of the given time, it is manife&s;t that
the line mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed <HI>&s;ine fine, &s;ine
limite,</HI> it mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed <HI>ad infinitum,</HI>
it mu&s;t vani&s;h, it mu&s;t become nothing.
The end of this diminution <HI>ad infinitum,</HI>
the vani&s;hing of the line, and its becoming
nothing, the&s;e three mu&s;t all happen at one
and the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, namely at the
expiration of the given time. So that an in|&s;tant
before the expiration of the given time,
or before the quantity becomes nothing, it
cannot truly be &s;aid to be actually dimini&s;hed
<HI>ad infinitum.</HI> Therefore while <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are
real quantities, they are not yet dimini&s;hed
<HI>ad infinitum,</HI> they may be farther dimi|ni&s;hed.
And con&s;equently the fir&s;t part of
your an&s;wer is quite be&s;ide the purpo&s;e: It
tends only to &s;hew that there is a real diffe|rence
between the moment and increment,
before the in&s;tant of time when I &s;uppo&s;e
them to become equal; that while they are
unequal, there is a difference between them.
A great di&s;covery, and undoubtedly true!</P>
<P>You proceed in your an&s;wer, <HI>If they,</HI> i.e.
a <HI>and</HI> b, <HI>are nothing, then the rectangles where|of
they are coefficients, become nothing likewi&s;e:</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="91">
<HI>and con&s;equently the</HI> momentum <HI>or</HI> incremen|tum,
<HI>whether Sir</HI> I&s;aac'<HI>s or mine, are in that
ca&s;e nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>This likewi&s;e is undoubtedly true. But it
is &s;o far from contradicting Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI>'s
doctrine, that it is perfectly agreeable
to it. What he &s;ays, and what I contend
for, is this.</P>
<P>Though &s;o long as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> are real quanti|ties,
their rectangle <HI>ab</HI> is a real quantity,
and there is a real difference between the
two quantities <HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA</HI> and <HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA</HI>&plus;<HI>ab</HI>:
Yet, when by a continual diminution
<HI>ad infinitum a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> vani&s;h, their rectangle
<HI>ab,</HI> or the difference between the two quan|tities
<HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA</HI> and <HI>aB</HI>&plus;<HI>bA</HI>&plus;<HI>ab,</HI> vani|&s;hes
likewi&s;e, and there is no longer any dif|ference
left between tho&s;e quantities, <HI>i.e.</HI>
tho&s;e quantities are equal. But you &s;ay,
when <HI>ab,</HI> when the difference between the&s;e
two quantities vani&s;hes, the quantities them|&s;elves
do likewi&s;e vani&s;h. I agree with you.
Their difference therefore vani&s;hes when
they vani&s;h: And they vani&s;h when their
difference vani&s;hes: Or, The quantities
them&s;elves, and the difference between them,
vani&s;h at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant of time.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="92">
You &s;ee I agree perfectly with you, that
the moment and increment vani&s;h at the

<P>I am &s;o de&s;irous of leaving both you, Sir,

point, that I cannot content my&s;elf with on|ly
demon&s;trating, that in fact the thing is as
I &s;ay, unle&s;s I likewi&s;e &s;hew you by what
means it comes to be &s;o. The ca&s;e is this.</P>
<P>While <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> is gradually dimini&s;hed, the ra|tio
between the increment and moment is
likewi&s;e perpetually dimini&s;hed, and tends
to a certain limit which it can never pa&s;s,
and can never arrive at till <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> is dimini&s;hed <HI>ad</HI>

<P>Likewi&s;e while <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> is gradually dimini&s;hed,
the increment and moment are perpetually
dimini&s;hed, and tend to a certain limit, which
they can never arrive at till <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI> is dimini&s;hed

<P>XXXIII. We come now to the method
for obtaining a rule to find the fluxion of any
power of a flowing quantity, which is deli|vered
in the introduction to the Quadratures,
and con&s;idered in the Analy&s;t. <HI>And here,</HI>
&s;ay you, <HI>the que&s;tion between us is, whether
I have rightly repre&s;ented the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e
words,</HI> evane&s;cant jam augmenta illa, <HI>in ren|dering
them, let the increments vani&s;h,</HI> i.e.
<HI>let the increments be nothing, or let there be no
increments?</HI> And &s;o, Sir, you would have
the Reader believe that this is the whole of
the que&s;tion between us: That we have each
of us &s;pent four or five pages, and may po&s;|&s;ibly
&s;pend twice as many more before we
have done, in wrangling about the tran&s;la|tion
of four <HI>Latin</HI> words. If &s;o, methinks
his be&s;t way will be to let us wrangle by our
&s;elves, and to tran&s;late tho&s;e four words
him&s;elf as he thinks fit, without ever trou|bling
his head about us.</P>
<P>But I take the que&s;tion between us to be
of a little more extent, and of &s;omewhat
more importance. What I have endeavour|ed
to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;en&s;e of, is not tho&s;e four
<PB N="92" REF="99">
words alone, but the whole pa&s;&s;age taken
together, <HI>i.e.</HI> in the &s;tyle of divines, the
text and the context. The whole pa&s;&s;age is,
<HI>Evane&s;cant jam augmenta illa &amp; eorum ratio
ultima erit,</HI> and I have endeavoured to &s;ettle
the meaning of this whole pa&s;&s;age taken toge|ther,
by comparing it with an equivalent pa&s;|&s;age,
but expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch terms as not to be
liable to any &s;ophi&s;tication, <HI>Na&s;cantur jam
augmenta illa &amp; eorum ratio prima erit.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore between us is not
barely how tho&s;e four words may be tran|&s;lated:
If they &s;tood alone, they might be tran|&s;lated
twenty different ways: But the que&s;tion
is, how the&s;e four words ought to be tran&s;lated
in conjunction with the other words that
follow; how the whole pa&s;&s;age ought to be
tran&s;lated, &s;o as to let the Reader under&s;tand
the meaning and de&s;ign of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
in that pa&s;&s;age. His de&s;ign is manife&s;tly to
con&s;ider the proportion between the evane|&s;cent
augments, or to con&s;ider the pro|portion
with which the augments vani&s;h.
He plainly makes two &s;uppo&s;itions in
this pa&s;&s;age. The fir&s;t is, that the aug|ments
vani&s;h, or become nothing. The &s;e|cond,
that the augments have a la&s;t ratio.
And his bu&s;ine&s;s is to determine what this
la&s;t ratio is: Now the que&s;tion between you
<PB N="93" REF="100">
and me is, when, at what in&s;tant of time
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the augments to
have this la&s;t ratio? You will needs have it,
that he &s;uppo&s;es the augments fir&s;t to vani&s;h,
to become nothing, and then con&s;iders the
proportion between tho&s;e nothings. I
maintain, that he con&s;iders the proportion
between the augments, not after they are va|ni&s;hed,
but at the in&s;tant that they vani&s;h,
in the very point of evane&s;cence. And I am
ju&s;tified by his own words, where he more
fully explains him&s;elf,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schol. Sect. 1. Libr. 1. Princip.</NOTE> <HI>intelligendam e&s;&s;e ra|tionem
quantitatum non antequam evane&s;cutn
NON POSTEA, &s;ed quacum evane&s;cunt.</HI>
You &s;ee therefore, Sir, the hard words, you
&s;ay, I have u&s;ed, do not fall upon my Friends,
but fall where I intended them. The blun|der
of making the quantities fir&s;t become no|thing,
and then &s;ettling the proportion be|tween
tho&s;e nothings, &s;tands ju&s;t as it did.
It puts me in mind of an Evidence, who was
in&s;tructed to &s;wear that a certain will was
made ju&s;t as the Te&s;tator was dying, and
was therefore &s;ub&s;equent to another will
made &s;ome time before his death. This per|&s;on
re&s;olved to make &s;ure work, and &s;wore
po&s;itively that this was the la&s;t will, for it
was made after the Te&s;tator was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101">
You &s;ee likewi&s;e you had no rea&s;on to de|&s;pair
of making me acknowledge, that va|ni&s;hing
and becoming nothing were equiva|lent
terms with Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> Indeed,
how was it po&s;&s;ible to think otherwi&s;e? A
na&s;cent augment mu&s;t have been nothing
before it began to exi&s;t, and an evane&s;cent
augment mu&s;t be nothing after it cea&s;es to
exi&s;t.</P>
<P>As it is my bu&s;ine&s;s chiefly to keep upon
the defen&s;ive, and I have hitherto had very
little occa&s;ion to act offen&s;ively, I did in my
fir&s;t Letter con&s;ider your important <HI>Lemma</HI>
and rea&s;oning upon it, no farther than was
nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> again&s;t
the con&s;equences you draw from that <HI>Lem|ma.</HI>
But now, as you are plea&s;ed to &s;hew
more than ordinary arrogance in this and the
following &s;ection, I hope the reader will ex|cu&s;e
me, if I &s;tep out of my way to call you
a little to account. A vigilant General,
who is a&s;&s;aulted in his entrenchments by an
overbearing and in&s;olent Enemy, may &s;ome|times
ob&s;erve that Enemy in the heat of his
attack, to lay him&s;elf &s;o open, as to give a
fair opportunity of &s;allying out and cha&s;ti&s;ing
him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102">
And it may not be ami&s;s to &s;hew, that
Mathematicians are not the only per&s;ons,
who <HI>fal&s;ely imagine their rational faculties to
be more improved than tho&s;e of other men, which
have been exerci&s;ed in a different manner, and
on different &s;ubjects.</HI> That there are other
per&s;ons, who <HI>erect them&s;elves into judges and
oracles, concerning matters,</HI> which they have
<HI>never</HI> &s;ufficiently <HI>con&s;idered nor comprehended.</HI>
And if this appear, it will &s;urely <HI>furni&s;h a

they admit in</HI> Logick. It will be <HI>a proper way
to abate the pride, and di&s;credit the preten&s;ions
of the&s;e</HI> Logicians and Metaphy&s;icians, <HI>who
in&s;i&s;t upon clear Ideas in points of</HI> Mathe|maticks,
<HI>if it be &s;hewn that they do without
them in their own &s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of your <HI>Lemma</HI> is this. If
one &s;uppo&s;ition be made, and be afterwards
de&s;troy'd by a CONTRARY &s;uppo&s;ition;
then every thing that followed from the
fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, is de&s;troyed with it. This
being laid down, you proceed thus. Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;uppo&s;es certain increments to
exi&s;t, or that there are certain increments.
In con&s;equence of their &s;uppo&s;ed exi&s;tence,
he forms certain expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e incre|ments,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
with intent to deduce the proportion
of the increments from tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions.
He afterwards &s;uppo&s;es that tho&s;e incre|ments
vani&s;h, <HI>i.e.</HI> &s;ay you, that the incre|ments
are nothing, that there are no incre|ments.</P>
<P>I forbear making any remarks upon your
interpretation of the word vani&s;h. I admit
it to be as you are plea&s;ed to make it, that
the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition is, there are increments;
and that the &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition is, there are
no increments. What do you infer from
this? The &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ay you, is
contrary to the former, and de&s;troys the for|mer,
and in de&s;troying the former it de|&s;troys
the expre&s;&s;ions, the proportions, and
every thing el&s;e derived from the former
&s;uppo&s;ition. Not too fa&s;t, good Mr. <HI>Logi|cian.</HI>
If I &s;ay, the increments now exi&s;t,
and, the increments do not now exi&s;t; the
latter a&s;&s;ertion will be contrary to the for|mer,
&s;uppo&s;ing now to mean the &s;ame in|&s;tant
of time in both a&s;&s;ertions. But if I
&s;ay at one time, the increments now exi&s;t;
and &s;ay an hour after, the increments do not
now exi&s;t; the latter a&s;&s;ertion will neither
be contrary, nor contradictory to the for|mer,
becau&s;e the fir&s;t now &s;ignifies one
<PB N="97" REF="104">
time, and the &s;econd now &s;ignifies another
time, &s;o that both a&s;&s;ertions may be true.
The ca&s;e therefore in your argument does
not come up to your <HI>Lemma,</HI> unle&s;s you will
&s;ay Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that there are
increments, and that there are no increments,
at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time. Which is what
you have not &s;aid, and what, I hope, you will
not dare to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But perhaps you will &s;till maintain, that
whether the &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition be e&s;teemed
contrary, or not contrary, to the fir&s;t, yet
as the increments, which were &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t
to exi&s;t, are now &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t, but
to be vani&s;hed and gone, all the con&s;equen|ces
of their &s;uppo&s;ed exi&s;tence, as their ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
proportions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t now be &s;up|po&s;ed
to be vani&s;hed and gone with them.
I cannot allow of this neither.</P>
<P>Let us imagine your &s;elf and me to be
debating this matter, in an open field, at a di|&s;tance
from any &s;helter, and in the middle
of a large company of Mathematicians and
Logicians. A &s;udden violent rain falls.
The con&s;equence is, we are all wet to the
&s;kin. Before we can get to covert, it clears
up, and the Sun &s;hines. You are for going
on with the di&s;pute. I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed,
I mu&s;t go home and &s;hift my cloaths, and
<PB N="98" REF="105">
advi&s;e you to do the &s;ame. You endeavour
to per&s;uade me I am not wet. The &s;hower,
&s;ay you, is vani&s;hed and gone, and con&s;e|quently
your coldne&s;s, and wetne&s;s, and every
thing derived from the exi&s;tence of the
&s;hower, mu&s;t have vani&s;hed with it. I tell
you I feel my &s;elf cold and wet. I take my
leave, and make ha&s;te home. I am per&s;uaded
the Mathematicians would all take the &s;ame
cour&s;e, and &s;hould think them but very in|different
Logicians, that were moved by your
arguments to &s;tay behind.</P>
<P>Another example may make all clear. I
know a certain Gentleman, who about the
fir&s;t day of <HI>April</HI> 1734, was verily per&s;ua|ded
he &s;aw more clearly into the principles
of fluxions, than Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> had ever
done. The con&s;equence of this per&s;ua&s;ion
was, that he publi&s;hed a book, which imme|diately
convinced all mankind of the con|trary.
He has &s;ince had &s;uch rea&s;ons given
him, as have entirely altered his opinion.
His former per&s;ua&s;ion is vani&s;hed and gone;
but the book that was the con&s;equence of
that per&s;ua&s;ion, is not vani&s;hed and gone
with it. It would have been much for his
credit, and for the quiet of the poor Genle|man's
mind, if it had.</P>

Section quoted. From all which it &s;eemed
to me, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was rather more
concerned in this affair than the <HI>Marquis,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="111">
who&s;e works I do not find to be quoted in
any of tho&s;e Sections, &s;o much as once.</P>
<P N="4">4. The arguments u&s;ed in the Analy&s;t
&s;eemed to me to bear equally hard again&s;t
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> and the <HI>Marquis</HI>; &s;o that I
could not &s;ee how you could condemn the
one, and acquit the other, of either of the
two errors.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations had &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
my mind, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was &s;up|po&s;ed
by you to be guilty of this double er|ror,
that nothing, but my firm per&s;ua&s;ion of
your veracity and integrity, could ever have
removed that apprehen&s;ion. I mu&s;t own, I
have &s;till one &s;cruple upon my thoughts. If
you will be &s;o good as to remove that, my
mind will be perfectly ea&s;y about this affair.
It is this.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t error in giving 2<HI>xdx</HI> for the dif|ference,
or 2<HI>xx&cmbdot;</HI> for the moment of <HI>xx,</HI> is
common to the <HI>Marquis</HI> and Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Marquis</HI> makes a &s;econd error, which
perfectly corrects the fir&s;t, whence his con|clu&s;ion
comes out right.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> makes no &s;econd error to
correct his fir&s;t, and therefore his conclu&s;ion
ought to come out wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">
And yet Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s conclu&s;ion comes out
exactly right, and is the &s;ame with the <HI>Mar|quis</HI>'s
conclu&s;ion. The more I con&s;ider this,
the more it puzzles me: Po&s;&s;ibly, for want of
the <HI>Philo&s;ophia prima,</HI> which you are &s;o great
a ma&s;ter of.</P>

<P>XXXIX. As you do not <HI>per&s;i&s;t,</HI> nay, on
the contrary, de&s;i&s;t, and entirely di&s;own your
accu&s;ing Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> of this double er|ror,
methinks there is now no occa&s;ion for
my producing any evidence to ju&s;tify him.
But you are plea&s;ed to <HI>call publickly upon me
to produce it,</HI> to <HI>deny as &s;trongly as I affirm,</HI>
to <HI>aver, that my declaring I have &s;uch evidence,
is an unque&s;tionable proof of the matchle&s;s con|tempt
that I,</HI> Philalethes, <HI>have for truth.</HI>
Why this indeed is matchle&s;s&mdash;Blindne&s;s,
or a&s;&s;urance, &s;hall I call it? I beg the Reader
will turn to <HI>p.</HI> 70. of my Defence. There
he will &s;ee I have already produced my e|vidence,
and have named the pa&s;&s;ages, where
the&s;e very objections of yours appear to have
been fore&s;een, and to be clearly and fully re|moved.
I have there named the pa&s;&s;ages, I
&s;ay, though you have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them, and
every Reader, who is qualified to examine
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, will find what I &s;ay to be
<PB N="106" REF="113">
true; and that the pretence of your fir&s;t er|ror
is fully removed by <HI>Lemma</HI> 7. and that
of the &s;econd by <HI>Lemma</HI> 1.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="40" TYPE="section">
<P>XL. I have nothing to &s;ay to the princi|ples
of the <HI>Marquis de l'Ho&s;pital,</HI> I defend
nothing but his rea&s;oning. You &s;ay, <HI>he re|jects
infinite&s;imals in virtue of a Po&s;tulatum,
and this you venture to call rejecting them with|out
ceremony.</HI> I know of no greater ceremo|ny
u&s;ed by <HI>Euclid,</HI> than to reject a thing in ne|ce&s;&s;ary
and unavoidable con&s;equence of a <HI>Po|&s;tulatum.</HI>
You tell me, <HI>he inferreth a conclu&s;ion
accurately true, contrary to the rules of Lo|gick,
from inaccurate and fal&s;e premi&s;es.</HI>
This I deny: for if his premi&s;es be allowed,
his conclu&s;ion will follow by the &s;tricte&s;t
rules of <HI>Logick,</HI> though tho&s;e premi&s;es are
fal&s;e. Allow him his fir&s;t <HI>po&s;tulatum,</HI> and
then 2<HI>xdx</HI> will be equal to 2<HI>xdx</HI>&plus;<HI>dxdx.</HI>
Allow him his &s;econd <HI>Po&s;tulatum,</HI> and then
<HI>RN</HI> in your figure (Analy&s;t, p. 32.) will be
equal to <HI>RL.</HI> And his conclu&s;ion mu&s;t
come out right. It &s;eems therefore, that the
<HI>Marquis</HI> is acquitted of this double error, as
well as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and that it is you
alone, who <HI>have acted blindfold, as not know|ing
the true rea&s;on of the conclu&s;ion's coming out
accurately right, which I &s;hew</HI> not <HI>to have</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="114">
<HI>been the effect of a double error,</HI> but of his two
<HI>Po&s;tulata.</HI></P>

<P>XLI. To all this declamation I &s;hall need
to give no other reply, than one you furni&s;h
me with, <HI>p.</HI> 27. of this very an&s;wer. <HI>It
mu&s;t be owned,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>that after you have

thus, nor have any meaning like this, but

<P>It mu&s;t be owned in your favour, you
have already recanted the principal of them,
and that which led to all the re&s;t, as amply
and fully, as from you could po&s;&s;ibly be ex|pected.
You had expre&s;&s;ed your &s;elf in Art.
CXXV of your new Theory of Vi&s;ion, in the
following words. "After reiterated endea|vours
to apprehend the GENERAL
IDEA of a Triangle, I have found it al|together
incomprehen&s;ible." But now,
<Q>Ut primum di&s;cu&s;&s;aeumbrae, &amp; lux redditamenti,</Q>
your eyes being opened, (pardon me this va|nity)
by the arguments I have done my
&s;elf the honour of laying before you, you
are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, "This implies that I
hold, there are no GENERAL IDEAS.
But I hold the direct contrary, that there
are INDEED GENERAL IDEAS,
but not formed by ab&s;traction in the man|ner
&s;et forth by Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">
I am &s;o much plea&s;ed with this piece of
ingenuity and candid proceeding, that for
the &s;ake of it I willingly excu&s;e all that fol|lows,
however incon&s;i&s;tent with this recanta|tion:
Particularly your making no difference
between a round &s;quare, and a &s;pace com|prehended
by three right lines. For the
&s;ame rea&s;on I willingly pa&s;s by your &s;uppo|&s;ing,
that the words of my definition have no
ideas, or conceptions of the mind, joined with
them, and con&s;equently that the definition
has no meaning. For to make the defi|nition
have a meaning, &s;ome particular idea,
&s;imple or compound, mu&s;t be joined to every
word u&s;ed in it; and a compound idea, made
up of all tho&s;e particular ideas, mu&s;t be joined
to, and always go along with the whole defini|tion:
And the&s;e two, the compound idea
and the definition are in&s;eparable, if the de|finition
be under&s;tood. Methinks therefore,
in&s;tead of &s;eparating the&s;e, it were better to
make a di&s;tinction between this compound
idea an&s;wering to the definition of a triangle,
and the image, or &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entation of
a triangle; two things which I have ob&s;erv|ed
you often to confound, both here and in
your other writings. The compound idea
is general, but the image, if exactly attend|ed

to and adequately perceived by the mind,
mu&s;t always be particular.</P>
