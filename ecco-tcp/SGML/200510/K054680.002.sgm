<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters and other Arti&s;ts in the Reign of JAMES I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was well for the arts that King James had no di&s;po&s;ition to them:
He let them take their own cour&s;e. Had he felt any inclination
for them, he would probably have introduced as bad a ta&s;te as he
did into litterature. A Prince who thought puns and quibbles the per|fection
of eloquence, would have been charmed with the monkies of
Hem&s;kirk and the drunken boors of O&s;tade. James loved his ea&s;e
and his plea&s;ures and hated novelties. He gave him&s;elf up to hunting
and hunted in the mo&s;t cumbrous and inconvenient of all dre&s;&s;es, a
ruff and trow&s;er breeches. The nobility kept up the magnificence
they found e&s;tabli&s;hed by Queen Elizabeth, in which predominated a
want of ta&s;te, rather than a bad one. In more ancient times the man|&s;ions
of the great lords, were, as I have mentioned before, built for de|fence
and &s;trength rather than convenience. The walls thick, the win|dows
pierced wherever it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for them to look abroad,
in&s;tead of being contrived for &s;ymmetry or to illuminate the chambers.
To that &s;tyle &s;ucceeded the richne&s;s and delicacy of the Gothic. As
this declined, before the Grecian ta&s;te was e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;pace and va&s;t|ne&s;s
&s;eem to have made their whole ideas of grandeur. The palaces
<PB N="2" REF="3">
erected in the reign of Elizabeth by the memorable Counte&s;s of Shrew&s;|bury,
Elizabeth of Hardwicke, are exactly in this &s;tyle. The apart|ments
are lofty and enormous, and they knew not how to furni&s;h them.
Pictures, had they had good ones, would be lo&s;t in chambers of &s;uch
height: Tape&s;try, their chief moveable, was not commonly perfect
enough to be real magnificence. Fretted cielings, gracefull mouldings
of windows, and painted gla&s;s, the ornaments of the preceding age,
were fallen into di&s;u&s;e. Immen&s;e lights compo&s;ed of bad gla&s;s in dia|mond
panes, ca&s;t an air of poverty on their mo&s;t co&s;tly apartments.
That at Hardwicke, &s;till pre&s;erved as it was furni&s;hed for the reception
and empri&s;onment of the Queen of Scots, is a curious picture of that
age and &s;tyle. Nothing can exceed the expence in the bed of &s;tate, in
the hangings of the &s;ame chamber, and of the coverings for the tables.
The fir&s;t is cloth of gold, cloth of &s;ilver, velvets of different colours,
lace, fringes and embroidery. The hangings con&s;i&s;t of figures, large
as life, repre&s;enting the virtues and vices, embroidered on grounds of
white and black velvet. The cloths to ca&s;t over the tables are embroi|dered
and embo&s;&s;ed with gold, on velvets and dama&s;ks, The only
moveables of any ta&s;te are the cabinets and tables them&s;elves, carved
in oak. The chimnies are wide enough for a hall or kitchen, and over
the arras are freezes of many feet deep with mi&s;erable relievos in &s;tucco
repre&s;enting huntings. There and in all the great man&s;ions of that age
is a gallery, remarkable only for its extent. That at Hardwicke is of
&s;ixty yards.</P>
<P>James built no palace him&s;elf. Tho&s;e erected by the Nobles in
his reign are much like what I have been de&s;cribing. Audley-inn, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, writing after the days of Inigo Jones, &s;ays, that this hou&s;e was not to be equalled by any fabric in this realm, excepting Hampton-court. There are prints of Audley-inn in it's grandeur by Win&s;tanley, who lived at Littlebury near it, where, within my memory, was his hou&s;e, remarkable for &s;everal mecha|nic tricks, known by the name of WINSTANLEY's WONDERS. His plates of Audley-inn are extant, but the prints are very &s;carce. Part of the edifice was taken down about forty years ago, and a greater part, with the magnificent gal|lery, was demoli&s;hed after the decea&s;e of the la&s;t Earl of Suffolk of that line.</NOTE>

one of the wonders of that age, de&s;erved little notice but for the pro|digious
&s;pace it covered. Towards the end of that monarch's reign
genius was called out and appeared. The magnificent temper or ta&s;te
of the Duke of Buckingham led him to collect pictures, and pointed
out the &s;tudy of them to Prince Charles. Rubens came over, Inigo
Jones aro&s;e, and architecture broke forth in all the lu&s;tre and purity of
Rome and Athens&mdash;But before I come to that period, I mu&s;t clear
my way by &s;ome account of the preceding arti&s;ts. The fir&s;t painter
who &s;eems to have arrived after the acce&s;&s;ion of James was</P>
<P>PAUL VANSOMER,</P>
<P>a native of Antwerp. The accounts of him are extremely deficient,
no author of the lives of painters mentioning him but Carl Vermander,
who only &s;ays that Van&s;omer was living when he wrote, and then re|&s;ided
with his brother Bernard at Am&s;terdam. Yet Van&s;omer as a
painter of portraits was a very able ma&s;ter. The picture of the Lord
Chamberlain William Earl of Pembroke, half length at St. James's,
is an admirable portrait, and a whole length at Chat&s;worth of the fir&s;t
Earl of Devon&s;hire in his robes, though a&s;cribed to Mytens, I &s;hould
think was painted by the &s;ame hand. Mytens was much colder in his
<PB N="4" REF="6">
colouring and &s;tiff in his drawing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mytens improved &s;o much in his later portraits, that this character mu&s;t be read with allowances; and on &s;tudying more of his works, I cannot determine whether the portrait at Chat&s;worth is not painted by him, as con&s;tant tradition &s;ays it was. In general, the portraits by Van&s;omer and Mytens, when at whole length, may be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed; Van&s;omer commonly placed his on a mat, Mytens, on a carpet.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e portraits are bold and
round, and the chiaro &s;curo good. The Earl of Devon&s;hire is equal
to the pencil of Vandyck, and one of the fine&s;t &s;ingle figures I have
&s;een. In what year Van&s;omer came to England we do not know; cer|tainly
as early as 1606, between which and 1620 he did &s;everal pic|tures.
I &s;hall mention but a few, that are indubitably his, from
whence by compari&s;on his manner may be known.</P>
<P>James I. at Wind&s;or, behind him a view of Whitehall.</P>
<P>Anne of Denmark, with a pro&s;pect of the we&s;t end of St. Paul's.</P>
<P>The &s;ame King at Hampton-court, armour lying by him on the
ground; better than the former. Dated 1615.</P>
<P>His Queen in blue, with a hor&s;e and dogs; al&s;o at Hampton-court.
This picture is imitated in the tape&s;try at Houghton.</P>
<P>Three ladies, 1615, at Ditchley; Lady Morton in purple; another,
with yellow lace about her neck and a gauze &s;carf: the third in black
with a crape over her forehead.</P>
<P>Lord Chancellor Bacon and his brother Nicholas at Gorhambury.</P>
<P>Sir Simon We&s;ton, brother of Lord Trea&s;urer Portland, whole
length with a pike in his hand, 1608, aet. 43. This piece was in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Raymond.</P>

generally, but inaccurately, called John&s;on, was, according to Sandrart,
born in London of Flemi&s;h parents; but Vertue, and the author of an
E&s;&s;ay towards an Engli&s;h &s;chool, &s;ay it was at Am&s;terdam, where the
latter a&s;&s;erts that he re&s;ided long, the former that he came over young,
which, con&s;idering how late he lived, I &s;hould be inclined to believe,
if Vertue did not at the &s;ame time pronounce that his earlie&s;t perfor|mances
are his be&s;t: So good a &s;tyle of colouring was hardly formed
here. His pictures are ea&s;ily <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;ometimes put this mark on his pictures <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> fecit.</NOTE> di&s;tingui&s;hed by their clearne&s;s,
neatne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s. They are generally painted on board, and
except being a little &s;tiff, are often &s;tronglly marked with a fair charac|ter
of nature, and remarkable for a lively tranquillity in the counte|nances.
His draperies are &s;eldom but black. I have two portraits by
him of &s;ingular merit; one of Mr. Leneve, ma&s;ter of the company of
merchant-taylors; the other of Sir George Villiers, father of the great
Duke of Buckingham, le&s;s hand&s;ome, but extremely like his &s;on. One
of his hands re&s;ts on the head of a greyhound, as fine as the animals of
Snyder.</P>
<P>Jan&s;en's fir&s;t works in England are dated about 1618. He dwelt
in the Black-friars, and had much bu&s;ine&s;s. His price for a head was
five broad pieces. He painted too in &s;mall in oil, and often copied his
<PB N="6" REF="9">
own works in that manner. In the family of Verney were the por|traits
of Sir Robert Heath and his lady in both &s;izes. At Ca&s;hiobury
is a large piece, curious, but &s;o inferior to Jan&s;en's general manner,
that if his name were not to it, I &s;hou'd doubt it's being of his hand.
It repre&s;ents Arthur Lord Capel, who was beheaded, his Lady and
Children. Behind them is a view of the Garden at Hadham, at that
time the chief &s;eat of the family. Between the years 1630 and 1640
Jan&s;en lived much in Kent at a &s;mall village called Bridge near Bar|hamdown,
and drew many portraits for gentlemen in the neighbour|hood,
particularly of the families of Auger, Palmer, Hammond and
Bowyer. One of his be&s;t works was the picture of a Lady Bowyer,
of the family of Auger, called for her exqui&s;ite beauty <HI>The Star in the
Ea&s;t.</HI> At Sherburn Ca&s;tle in Dor&s;et&s;hire is a head of Elizabeth Wri|othe&s;ley
elde&s;t daughter of Henry Earl of Southampton, and wife of
William Lord Spen&s;er, her head richly dre&s;&s;ed, and a picture in a blue
enamelled ca&s;e at her brea&s;t. This picture is well coloured, tho' not
equal to another at the &s;ame &s;eat, a half length of her mother, Eliza|beth,
daughter of John Vernon, wife of Earl Henry. Her cloaths
are magnificent, and the attire of her head, &s;ingular, a veil turned
quite back. The face and hands are coloured with incomparable
lu&s;tre, and equal to any thing this ma&s;ter executed. There is al&s;o a
half length in black &s;atten of John Digby, fir&s;t Earl of Bri&s;tol, young
and remarkably hand&s;ome. It is a&s;cribed to Jan&s;en, but is faintly
coloured, and evidently in the manner of Vandyck, whom perhaps he
imitated as well as rivalled.</P>
<P>Jan&s;en's fame declined <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Lord Pomfret's at Ea&s;ton was a portrait of Charles I. by Jan&s;en.</NOTE> on the arrival of Vandyck, and the civil war
<PB N="7" REF="10" MS="y">
breaking out, Cornelius, at the importunity of his wife, quitted Eng|land.
His pa&s;s is recorded in the Journals of the Commons:</P>
<P>October 10, 1648. Ordered, that Cornelius John&s;on, picture-drawer,
&s;hall have Mr. Speaker's warrant to pa&s;s beyond &s;eas with Emanuel
Pa&s;&s;e, George Hawkins; and to carry with him &s;uch pictures and co|lours,
bedding, hou&s;hold &s;tuff, pewter, and bra&s;s, as belongs unto him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>He retired fir&s;t to Midelburg and then to Am&s;terdam, where he
continued to paint and died in 1665. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandrart, p. 314.</NOTE> His wife's name was Eliza|beth
Beck, to whom he was married in 1622. They had a &s;on Cor|nelius,
bred to his father's profe&s;&s;ion, which he followed in Holland,
where he died poor, being ruined by the extravagance of a &s;econd wife.
The &s;on drew the Duke of Monmouth's picture, as he was on the
point of &s;ailing for his unfortunate expedition to England.</P>
<P>A &s;i&s;ter of Cornelius Jan&s;en the elder was &s;econd wife of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the catalogue of King Charles's pictures is mentioned a portrait drawn by George Spence of Nuremberg, and bought of Nica&s;ius Ru&s;&s;el, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">35.</NOTE> Nica&s;ius
Ru&s;&s;el or Rou&s;&s;el of Bruges, jeweller to the Kings James and Charles
the fir&s;t. They had many children. To one of the &s;ons born in
1619 Cornelius Jan&s;en was godfather, and the widow of I&s;aac Oliver,
godmother. Theodore Ru&s;&s;el, an elder &s;on was born in 1614, and
lived nine years with his uncle Cornelius Jan&s;en, and afterwards with
Vandyck, who&s;e pictures he copied very tolerably on &s;mall pannels;
many of them are in a private apartment at Wind&s;or, at Warwick|ca&s;tle,
and in the collection of the Duche&s;s Dowager of Argyle.
Ru&s;&s;el chiefly was employed in the country in the families of the Earls
of E&s;&s;ex and Holland, and was a lover of his ea&s;e and his bottle.
<PB N="8" REF="11">
He was father of Antony Ru&s;&s;el, a painter, from whom Vertue recei|ved
the&s;e particulars, and at who&s;e hou&s;e he &s;aw a picture of Cornelius
Jan&s;en, his wife and &s;on, drawn by Adrian Hanneman, who courted
Jan&s;en's neice, but was di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>DANIEL MYTENS</P>
<P>of the Hague, was an admired painter in the reigns of King James
and King Charles. He had certainly &s;tudied the works of Rubens
before his coming over; his land&s;cape in the back grounds of his por|traits
is evidently in the &s;tyle of that &s;chool; and &s;ome of his works
have been taken for Vandyck's. The date of his arrival is not certain;
probably it was in hopes of &s;ucceeding Van Somer; but though he
drew &s;everal of the court, he was not formally employed as the King's
painter 'till the reign of Charles. His patent is pre&s;erved in Rymer's
Foedera, vol. xviii, p. 3.</P>

At Hampton-court are &s;everal whole lengths of Princes and Prin|ce&s;&s;es
of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick-Lunenburgh, and the portrait of
Charles Howard Earl of Nottingham; at Ken&s;ington is Mytens's own
head. At Knowle, Lionel Cranfield Earl of Middle&s;ex, Lord Trea|&s;urer,
with his white &s;taff, whole length. A &s;mall bell on the table has
the&s;e letters D. M. F. 1623. It was more common for him to paint a
&s;lip of paper on his pictures, in&s;cribed only with the names or titles of
the per&s;ons repre&s;ented. At Lady Elizabeth Germain's at Drayton,
is a very fine whole length of Henry Rich Earl of Holland, in a &s;tri|ped
habit with a walking &s;tick. At St. James's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The picture of the Queen of Scots at St. James's is a copy by Mytens.</NOTE> is Jeffery Hud&s;on
the dwarf, holding a dog by a &s;tring, in a land&s;cape, coloured warmly
and freely like Snyder or Rubens. Mytens drew the &s;ame figure in a
very large picture of Charles I. and his Queen, which was in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the late Earl of Dunmore, but the &s;ingle figure is much bet|ter
painted. The hi&s;tory of this diminutive per&s;onage was &s;o remark|able,
that the reader will perhaps not di&s;like the digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Fuller and Wright's Rutland&s;hire.</NOTE> He was born at Oakham in Rutland&s;hire in 1619, and about the
age of &s;even or eight, being then but eighteen inches high, was re|tained
in the &s;ervice of the Duke of Buckingham, who re&s;ided at Bur|leigh
on the Hill. Soon after the marriage of Charles I, the King and
Queen being entertained at Burleigh, little Jeffery was &s;erved up to
table in a cold pye, and pre&s;ented by the Duche&s;s to the Queen, who
kept him as her dwarf. From &s;even years of age 'till thirty he never
grew taller; but after thirty he &s;hot up to three feet nine inches, and
there fixed. Jeffery became a con&s;iderable part of the entertainment
<PB N="10" REF="14">
of the court. Sir William Davenant wrote a poem called Jeffreidos,
on a battel between him and a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;cene is laid at Dunkirk, and the midwi&s;e re&s;cues him from the fury of his antagoni&s;t.</NOTE> turkey-cock, and in 1638 was publi&s;h|ed
a very &s;mall book called The New-year's Gift, pre&s;ented at court
from the Lady Parvula to the Lord Minimus (commonly called little
Jeffery) her maje&s;ty's &s;ervant, &amp;c. written by Microphilus, with a little
print of Jeffery prefixed. Before this period Jeffery was employed on
a negotiation of great importance: He was &s;ent to France to fetch a
midwife for the Queen, and on his return with this gentlewoman, and
her maje&s;ty's dancing-ma&s;ter, and many rich pre&s;ents to the Queen
from her mother Mary de Medici, he was taken by the Dunkirkers. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was in 1630. Be&s;ides the pre&s;ent he was bringing for the Queen, he lo&s;t to the value of 2500<HI>l.</HI> that he had received in France on his own account from the Queen-mother and ladies of that court.</NOTE>
Jeffery, thus made of con&s;equence, grew to think him&s;elf really &s;o.
He had born with little temper the teazing of the courtiers and dome|&s;tics,
and had many &s;quabbles with the King's gigantic porter; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A ba&s;relief of this dwarfand giant is to be &s;een fixed in the front of a hou&s;e near the end of Bagnio-court on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Newgate-&s;treet. Probably it was a &s;ign. Oliver Cromwell too had a porter of an enormous height, who&s;e &s;tandard is recorded by a large O on the back of the terrace at Wind&s;or, almo&s;t under the window of the gallery. This man went mad and prophecied. In Whitechapel was a &s;ign of him taken from a print of St. Peter.</NOTE> at la&s;t
being provoked by Mr. Crofts, a young gentleman of family, a chal|lenge
en&s;ued, and Mr. Crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only
with a &s;quirt, the little creature was &s;o enraged that a real duel en&s;ued,
and the appointment being on hor&s;eback with pi&s;tols, to put them more

on a level, Jeffery with the fir&s;t fire &s;hot his antagoni&s;t dead. This
happened in France whither he had attended his mi&s;tre&s;s in the trou|bles.
He was again taken pri&s;oner by a Turki&s;h rover, and &s;old into
Barbary. He probably did not long remain in &s;lavery; for at the be|ginning
of the civil war he was made a captain in the royal army, and
in 1644 attended the Queen to France where he remained 'till the re|&s;toration.
At la&s;t upon &s;u&s;picion of his being privy to the Popi&s;h plot,
he was taken up in 1682, and confined in the gate-hou&s;e We&s;tmin&s;ter,
where he ended his life in the &s;ixty-third year of his age.</P>
<P>Mytens remained in great reputation 'till the arrival of Vandyck,
who being appointed the King's principal painter, the former in di&s;|gu&s;t
a&s;ked his maje&s;ty's leave to retire to his own country; but the
King learning the cau&s;e of his di&s;&s;atisfaction, treated him with much
kindne&s;s, and told him that he could find &s;ufficient employment both
for him and Vandyck; Mytens con&s;ented to &s;tay, and even grew inti|mate,
it is probable, with his rival, for the head of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions the name of I&s;aac appears in this plate, in&s;tead of Daniel. It was corrected afterwards.</NOTE> Mytens is one
of tho&s;e painted among the profe&s;&s;ors by that great ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;ame jealou&s;y operated again, or real decline of bu&s;ine&s;s
influenced him, or any other cau&s;e, Mytens did not &s;tay much longer in
England. We find none of his works here after the year 1630. Yet
he lived many years afterwards. Houbraken quotes a regi&s;ter at the
Hague dated in 1656, at which time it &s;ays Mytens painted part of
the cieling of the town-hall there; the &s;ubject is, Truth writing hi&s;tory
on the back of Fame.</P>

pieces of this ma&s;ter in the royal collection, chiefly hi&s;toric minia|tures;
&s;even of them are &s;till pre&s;erved in Queen Caroline's clo&s;et at
Ken&s;ington. At the Earl of Exeter's at Burleigh is the &s;tory of Venus
and Adonis, painted by Peter, and dated 1631. Vertue mentions
another, which was in Mr. Hal&s;ted's &s;ale in May, 1726; it repre&s;ented
Jo&s;eph, the Virgin, and the Child a-&s;leep, eight inches wide and five
high. On it was written his name, with the termination French, P.
Olivier fecit, 1628. Another piece, a fine drawing in indian ink, was
copied by him from a picture of Raphael in the collection of King
Charles, St. John pre&s;enting a cro&s;s to the child, kneeling before the
Virgin. The original was &s;old after the King's death to the Spani&s;h
Emba&s;&s;ador for 600<HI>l.</HI> Jerome Laniere bought Peter's drawing, and
&s;old it for twenty guineas to Mr. John Evelyn, from whom it came to
the pre&s;ent Sir John Evelyn. The Duke of Devon&s;hire has the por|trait
of Edward 6th. when an infant, the drapery highly ornamented

Drayton the Madonna and Child. The fine&s;t work of Peter Oliver in my
opinion is the head of his own wife, in the cabinet of the Duche&s;s of
Portland: It is life it&s;elf. I doubt whether his father ever excelled this
piece. I have a head of the &s;ame woman drawn with black lead on
the leaf of a vellom pocket-book; on the rever&s;e is his own portrait

are not known, as he commonly made duplicates of his pictures, re|&s;erving
one of each for him&s;elf. On this &s;ubject Ru&s;&s;el the painter,
related to or connected with the Olivers, told Vertue a remarkable
&s;tory. The greater part of the collection of King Charles being di&s;per|&s;ed
in the troubles, among which were &s;everal of the Olivers, Charles
II. who remembered, and was de&s;irous of recovering them, made many
inquiries about them after the re&s;toration. At la&s;t he was told by one
Rogers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vertue &s;ays he was very great at court; it was probably Progers, well known for being employed in the King's private plea&s;ures. See Memoires de Grammont.</NOTE> of I&s;leworth that both the father and &s;on were dead, but that
the &s;on's widow was living at I&s;leworth and had many of their works.
The King went very privately and unknown with Rogers to &s;ee them;
the widow &s;howed &s;everal fini&s;hed and unfini&s;hed, with many of which
the King being plea&s;ed, a&s;ked if &s;he would &s;ell them: She replied,
&s;he had a mind the King &s;hould &s;ee them fir&s;t, and if he did not pur|cha&s;e
them, &s;he &s;hould think of di&s;po&s;ing of them. The King di&s;co|vered
him&s;elf, on which &s;he produced &s;ome more pictures which &s;he
&s;eldom &s;howed. The King de&s;ired her to &s;et her price; &s;he &s;aid &s;he did
not care to make a price with his maje&s;ty, &s;he would leave it to him;
but promi&s;ed to look over her hu&s;band's books and let his maje&s;ty
know what prices his father the late King had paid. The King took
<PB N="16" REF="23">
away what he liked, and &s;ent Rogers to Mrs. Oliver with the option of
1000<HI>l.</HI> or an annuity of 300<HI>l,</HI> for her life. She cho&s;e the latter. Some
years afterwards it happened that the King's mi&s;tre&s;&s;es having begged
all or mo&s;t of the&s;e pictures, Mrs. Oliver, who was probably a prude
and apt to expre&s;s her&s;elf like a prude, &s;aid, on hearing it, that if &s;he had
thought the King would have given them to &s;uch whores, and &s;trum|pets
and ba&s;tards, he never &s;hould have had them. This reached the
court, the poor woman's &s;alary was &s;topped, and &s;he never received it
afterwards. The re&s;t of the limnings which the King had not taken,
fell into the hands of Mrs. Ru&s;&s;el's father.</P>
<P>Peter Oliver, &s;ays Vertue, died about the year 1664, aged near 60;
but this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take, as his father's drawing at Ken&s;ington
fini&s;hed by the &s;on is dated 1616, when by that account Peter was not
above twelve years old. From his age and the &s;tory of his widow it
is more likely that he died before the re&s;toration. Probably the date
1664 &s;hould be 1654. He was buried with his father in the Black|&s;ryars.</P>
<P>As in none of the&s;e accounts mention is made of any children of
Peter Oliver, I conclude that I&s;aac Oliver, gla&s;s-painter, born in 1616,
was &s;on of the younger brother James. Among the ver&s;es printed by
the univer&s;ity of Cambridge in 1638 on the death of Mr. Edward
King, Milton's Lycidas, one of the Engli&s;h copies is in&s;cribed, I&s;aac
Oliver, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Peck's life of Milton, p. 36.</NOTE> who, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the gla&s;s-painter, and then about the age

and in &s;ome of the chapels at Oxford the art again appears dating it|&s;elf

A few lovers of the art collected &s;ome di&s;per&s;ed panes from ancient buildings, particularly the late Lord Cobham, who erected a gothic temple at Stowe, and filled it with arms of the old Nobility, &amp;c. About the year 1753, one A&s;ciotti an Italian, who had married a Flemi&s;h woman, brought a parcel of painted gla&s;s from Flanders, and &s;old it for a very few guineas to the Hon. Mr. Bateman of Old Wind&s;or. Upon that I &s;ent A&s;ciotti again to Flanders, who brought me 450 pieces, for which, including the expence of his journey, I paid him thirty-&s;ix guineas.

<P>though of a very inferior walk in the profe&s;&s;ion, de&s;erves to be remem|bered

married his mother, and who ob&s;erving his inclination to limning and

Earl of Arundel, to purcha&s;e for him, but returning by Mar&s;eilles and
by &s;ome accident being di&s;appointed of the remittances he expected,
and totally unknown there, he was ob&s;erved by a French gentleman
<PB N="20" REF="28">
to walk many hours every day on the cours in a di&s;con&s;olate manner.
The gentleman inquiring into his circum&s;tances, told him, that percei|ving
he was able to walk at lea&s;t twenty miles a day, if he would &s;et
out on his journey homewards, he would furni&s;h him hand&s;omely for

certain letters written from his maje&s;ty to the King of Per&s;ia, the &s;um

<P>The warrant for re&s;toring the u&s;e of the old Engli&s;h march, which

by this per&s;on; but the be&s;t evidence of his abilities is a curious patent
lately di&s;covered. The pre&s;ent Earl of Stirling received from a relation
an old box of neglected writings, among which he found the original
commi&s;&s;ion of Charles I. appointing his Lord&s;hip's predece&s;&s;or Alexan|der
Earl of Stirling commander in chief of Nova-Scotia with the con|firmation
of the grant of that province made by James I. In the initial
letter are the portraits of the King &s;itting on the throne delivering the
patent to the Earl, and round the border repre&s;entations in miniature
of the cu&s;toms, huntings, fi&s;hings and productions of the country, all
in the highe&s;t pre&s;ervation, and &s;o admirably executed, that it was be|lieved
of the pencil of Vandyck. But as I know no in&s;tance of that
<PB N="21" REF="29">
ma&s;ter having painted in this manner, I cannot doubt but it was the
work of Norgate, allowed the be&s;t illuminator of that age, and gene|rally
employed, &s;ays Fuller, to make the initial letters in the patents of
Peers and commi&s;&s;ions of Emba&s;&s;adors. Fuller concludes his account

Mireveldt as very fanta&s;tic and capricious. Mr. We&s;t has two

<P>Of this per&s;on I find no farther record with relation to the arts, but
that he made a pre&s;ent to the King of a &s;ea-piece painted by Per&s;ellis;
and was dead when Vanderdort drew up the catalogue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King Charles's catalogue page 13. He went to Paris to be cut for the &s;tone in the bladder in 1635, and probably died there.

See Strafford papers, vol. i. p. 361. 336. 524. He was &s;ometime chancellor of the garter, and founded five additional Alms-knights, by his will dated in 1635.

<P>Stone had three &s;ons, Henry, Nicholas, and John. The two elde&s;t
were &s;ent to Italy to &s;tudy; the younge&s;t was educated at Oxford, being
de&s;igned for a clergyman, but in the civil war he entered into the army
on the King's &s;ide. During that period this John Stone publi&s;hed a
book on fortification, called Enchiridion, with many &s;mall cuts etched
by him&s;elf but without his name. The King's forces being routed,
young Stone and a companion made their e&s;cape; the latter was taken
and hanged before his father's door in Smithfield, but Stone hid him|&s;elf
in his father's hou&s;e in Long-acre for above a twelve-month, with|out
the knowledge, &s;ays Vertue, of his father, whence I &s;uppo&s;e, he
had either offended the old man by quitting his &s;tudies for arms, or the
father was too prudent to ri&s;k the emoluments of his profe&s;&s;ion by en|gaging
in party-di&s;&s;entions. John at la&s;t found means of retiring to
France, where he lived &s;ome years, and, I conclude, applied him&s;elf to
the arts, as we &s;hall find him after his return engaged in his father's
bu&s;ine&s;s. Nicholas, the &s;econd &s;on, was of a promi&s;ing genius; and
while abroad modelled after the antiques &s;o well, that his works have
been mi&s;taken for the be&s;t Italian ma&s;ters. Mr. Bird the &s;tatuary had
<PB N="34" REF="43">
the Laocoon and Bernini's Apollo and Daphne in Terra cotta by this
Nicholas Stone, and Vertue &s;aw a book with many of his drawings of
palaces, churches, and other buildings in Italy. He returned to Eng|land
in 1642, and died the &s;ame year as his father.</P>
<P>Henry, the elde&s;t &s;on, who erected the monument for his father,
mother, and brother, carried on, in conjunction with John, the bu&s;ine&s;s
of &s;tatuary, after his father's death; though Henry addicted him&s;elf
chiefly to painting, and was an excellent copyi&s;t of Vandyck and the
Italian ma&s;ters: He is generally known by the name of <HI>Old Stone,</HI> I
&s;uppo&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h him from his brother John. Henry wrote a
book, a thin folio, entituled the third part of the art of painting, taken
mo&s;tly from the ancients. Vertue, who &s;aw this book, was uncertain
whether the two former parts were compo&s;ed by Stone, or by &s;ome
other author. The accounts of Nicholas Stone, &s;en. which I have
quoted above, were continued by John, while he and Henry worked in
partner&s;hip; among other articles are the following;</P>

<P>who calls him&s;elf joyner and architect, invented the triumphal arches

<P>I &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay on the reign of King James, with
a brief account of a few of his medalli&s;ts. This article is one of the
mo&s;t deficient in Vertue's notes; he had found but very &s;light materials,
though equally inqui&s;itive on this head with the re&s;t. One mu&s;t ex|cept
the &s;ubject of the two Simons, of who&s;e works as he him&s;elf pub|li&s;hed
a mo&s;t curious volume, I &s;hall omit the mention of them in this
catalogue, only de&s;iring that Vertue's account of the two Simons and
Hollar, and the catalogues of the collections of King Charles, King
James and the Duke of Buckingham, may be regarded as parts of this
his great de&s;ign. By tho&s;e &s;pecimens one &s;ees how perfect he wi&s;hed
and laboured to make the whole.</P>
<P>I was in hopes of compleating this article, by having recour&s;e to
Mr. Evelyn's Di&s;cour&s;e on Medals, but was extremely di&s;appointed to
&s;ind that in a folio volume, in which he has given the plates and in|&s;criptions
of a regular &s;eries of our medals, he takes not the lea&s;t no|tice
of the gravers. I &s;hould not have expected that a virtuo&s;o &s;o know|ing
would have contented him&s;elf with de&s;criptions of the per&s;ons re|pre&s;ented,
he who had it in his inclination, and generally in his power,
to inform po&s;terity of almo&s;t every thing they would wi&s;h to learn.
Had Mr. Evelyn never regretted his ignorance of the names of the
workmen of tho&s;e inimitable medals of the Seleucidae, of the fair
<PB N="41" REF="51">
coins of Augu&s;tus, and of the Denarii of the other Roman Emperors?
Was he &s;atisfied with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the effigies of Tiberius, Claudius, Irene,
without wi&s;hing to know the names of the ingenious and more harmle&s;s
gravers&mdash;Why did he think po&s;terity would not be as curious to learn
who were the medalli&s;ts of Charles II. James I. Mary I.? He has
omitted all names of gravers except in two or three of the plates,
and even there &s;ays not a word of the arti&s;t. For in&s;tance in a

<P>THOMAS BUSHELL</P>
<P>was probably a medalli&s;t of the &s;ame age. In the year 1737 Mr.

This Coquerel, I find by another note, was Generalis monetarius,
or Pope of the mint, into which the reformation was to be introduced.
The Luther, Briot, I &s;uppo&s;e, mi&s;carried, as we &s;oon afterwards find
him in the &s;ervice of the crown of England, where projectors were
more favorably received. From the&s;e circum&s;tances I conclude he ar|rived
in the reign of King James, though he did not make his way to
court before the acce&s;&s;ion of King Charles, the patron of genius.
Briot's fir&s;t public work was a medal of that Prince exhibited in Eve|lyn,
with the arti&s;t's name and the date 1628. To all or to almo&s;t all
his coins and medals he put at lea&s;t the initial letter of his name. He
was employed both in England and Scotland. In 1631, as appears by
<PB N="45" REF="55">
Rymer's Foedera, tom xix. p. 287, a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion was appointed
for making trial of the experience &s;kill and indu&s;try of Nicholas
Briot, in the coinage of money at the mint, dated June 13, 1631, at
We&s;tmin&s;ter. This was the project he had attempted in France, by
in&s;truments, mills and pre&s;&s;es, to make better money and with le&s;s ex|pence
to the crown than by the way of hammering. The &s;cheme was
probably approved, for in the very next year we find him coining mo|ney
upon the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment. There is extant a parchment roll,
containing the accounts of Sir Robert Harley, Knight of the Bath,
ma&s;ter worker of his maje&s;ty's monies of gold and &s;ilver within the
tower of London, in the reign of King Charles I. from November 8,
1628, to Augu&s;t 1, 1636. In this account, in 1632 are payments to
Briot for coining various parcels of gold and &s;ilver, which are followed
by this entry.</P>
<P>"And delivered to his maje&s;tie in fair &s;ilver monies at Oatlands by
Sir Thomas Ayle&s;bury, viz. iij crownes, and iij half crownes of Briot's
moneys, and iij crownes, and iij half crownes, and ten &s;hillings of the
monoyers making."</P>
<P>The&s;e comparative pieces were probably pre&s;ented to the King by Sir
Robert Harley, Briot's patron, to &s;how the &s;uperior excellence of the
latter's method.</P>
<P>Briot returned to France about 1642, having formed that excellent
&s;cholar Thomas Simon.</P>

<GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. The tradition in that family was, that the carver having been

removed from the &s;ervice of the crown, and at la&s;t obtaining the place
of poor Knight at Wind&s;or, cut that curio&s;ity to &s;how he was not &s;u|perannuated
nor incapable of his office as he had been repre&s;ented. If
the mark <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignified Nicholas Briot, as is probable, either the &s;tory
is fictitious, or Briot did not return to France on the breaking out of the
civil war. The latter is mo&s;t likely, as in the Trea&s;ury, where the plate
of St. George's chapel is depo&s;ited, there is &s;uch another piece, though
inferior in workman&s;hip to that above-mentioned. In the Mu&s;eum at

Di&s;per&s;ion of the King's Collection, and of the Earl

<P>THE acce&s;&s;ion of this Prince was the fir&s;t aera of real ta&s;te in
England. As his temper was not profu&s;e, the expence he
made in collections, and the rewards he be&s;towed on men of
true genius and merit, are proofs of his judgment. He knew how
and when to be&s;tow. Queen Elizabeth was avaricious with pomp;
James I. lavi&s;h with meanne&s;s. A prince who patronizes the arts, and
can di&s;tingui&s;h abilities, enriches his country, and is at once generous
and an oeconomi&s;t. Charles had virtues to make a nation happy; for|tunate,
if he had not thought, that he alone knew how to make them
happy, and that he alone ought to have the power of making them &s;o!</P>
<P>His character, as far as it relates to my &s;ubject, is thus given by
Lilly; "He had many excellent parts in nature, was an excellent

was a good judge of pictures, a good mathematician, not un&s;killfull in
mu&s;ic, well read in divinity, excellently in hi&s;tory and law, he &s;poke
&s;everal languages, and writ well, good language and &s;tyle." Perinchief
is &s;till more particular; "His &s;oul, &s;ays that writer, was &s;tored with a
full knowledge of the nature of things, and ea&s;ily comprehended almo&s;t
all kinds of arts that either were for delight or of a public u&s;e; for he
was ignorant of nothing, but of what he thought it became him to be
negligent, for many parts of learning, that are for the ornament of a
private per&s;on, are beneath the cares of a crowned head. He was well
&s;killed in things of antiquity, could judge of medals whether they had
the number of years they pretended unto; his libraries and cabinets
were full of tho&s;e things on which length of time put the value of rari|ties.
In painting he had &s;o excellent a fancy, that he would &s;upply the
defect of art in the workman, and &s;uddenly draw tho&s;e lines, give tho&s;e
airs and lights, which experience and practice had not taught the

<P>With regard to his knowledge of pictures, I find the following anec|dote
from a book called the original and growth of printing by Rich|ard
Atkyns <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> "This excellent Prince, &s;ays that author, who was
not only aliquis in omnibus, but &s;ingularis in omnibus, hearing of rare
heads (painted) among&s;t &s;everal other pictures brought me from Rome,
&s;ent Sir James Palmer to bring them to Whitehall to him, where were
pre&s;ent divers picture-drawers and painters. He a&s;ked them all of
who&s;e hand that was? &s;ome gue&s;t at it; others were of another opi|nion,
but none was po&s;itive. At la&s;t &s;aid the King, This is of &s;uch a
man's hand, I know it as well as if I had &s;een him draw it; but, &s;aid
he, is there but one man's hand in this picture? None did di&s;cern
whether there was or not; but mo&s;t concluded there was but one hand.
<PB N="50" REF="60">
Said the King, "I am &s;ure there are two hands have workt in it, for
I know the hand that drew the heads, but the hand that did the re&s;t I
never &s;aw before." Upon this a gentleman that had been at Rome
about ten years before, affirmed that he &s;aw this very picture, with the
two heads unfini&s;hed at that time, and that he heard his brother (who
&s;taid there &s;ome years after him) &s;ay, that the widow of the painter
that drew it wanting money, got the be&s;t ma&s;ter &s;he could find to fini&s;h
it and make it &s;aleable." This &s;tory which in truth is but a blind one,
e&s;pecially as Mr. Atkyns does not mention even the name of the
painter of his own picture, &s;eems calculated to prove a fact, of which
I have no doubt, his maje&s;ty's knowledge of hands. The gentleman
who &s;tood by and was &s;o long before he recollected &s;o circum&s;tantial
a hi&s;tory of the picture, was, I dare &s;ay, a very good courtier.</P>
<P>The King is &s;aid not only to have loved painting but to have prac|ticed
it; it is affirmed that Rubens corrected &s;ome of his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Piles, in his life of Rubens, &s;ays, that the King's mother-in-law, Mary de' Medici de&s;igned well.</NOTE> maje&s;ty's

<P>It was immediately after his acce&s;&s;ion that Charles began to form his
collection. The crown was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;&s;ion of &s;ome good pictures:
Henry VIII. had &s;everal. What painters had been here had added
others. Prince Henry, as I have &s;aid, had begun a &s;eperate collection

His maje&s;ty was de&s;irous too of having &s;omething of the hand of Ber|nini.
Vandyck drew in one piece the full face and the three quarter
face and the profile of the King, from which Bernini made a bu&s;t,
that was con&s;umed or &s;tolen in the fire of Whitehall. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is very uncertain what became of this bu&s;t: Vertue from &s;everal circum|&s;tances, which I &s;hall lay before the reader, believed it was not de&s;troyed. Cooper the print-&s;eller told him that he had often heard Norrice frame-maker to the court, and who &s;aved &s;everal of the pictures, averr, that he was in the room where the bu&s;t u&s;ed to &s;tand over a corner chimney, and that it was taken away before that chamber was de&s;troyed. Lord Cutts who commanded the troops, was impatient to blow up that part, and yet after he had ordered the drums to beat, it was half an hour before the explo&s;ion was begun, time enough to have &s;aved the bu&s;t, if it was not &s;tolen before. Sir John Stanley, then deputy-chamberlain, was of the latter opinion. He was at dinner in Craig-court when the fire began which was about three o'clock: He immediately went to the palace, and perceived only an incon&s;iderable &s;moke in a garret, not in the principal building. He found Sir Chri&s;topher Wren and his workmen there, and the gates all &s;hut. Looking at Bernini's bu&s;t, he begged Sir Chri&s;topher to take care of That, and the &s;tatues. The latter replied, "Take you care of what you are concerned in and leave the re&s;t to me." Sir John &s;aid it was above five hours after this before the fire reached that part. Norrice afterwards dug in the ruins of that chamber but could not di&s;|cover the lea&s;t fragment of marble. The crouching Venus in the &s;ame apartment was known to be &s;tolen, being di&s;covered after a concealment of four years and re|taken by the crown. Vertue thought that the brazen bu&s;t of King Charles in the pa&s;&s;age near We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, was not taken from Bernini's, of which ca&s;ts are extant, but of an earlier date. In the imperial library at Vienna, &s;ays Dr. Edward Brown in his travels, is a head of King Charles in white marble, but this cannot be Bernini's, as Brown wrote in 1673, and the fire of Whitehall happened in 1697.</NOTE> It was on
<PB N="58" REF="69">
&s;eeing this picture that Bernini pronounced, as is well known, that
there was &s;omething unfortunate in the countenance of Charles. The
&s;ame arti&s;t made a bu&s;t too of Mr. Baker, who carried the picture to
Rome. The Duke of Kent's father bought the latter bu&s;t at Sir Pe|ter
Lely's &s;ale; it is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Roy&s;ton, and was
reckoned preferable to that of the King. The hair is in prodigious
quantity and incomparably loo&s;e and free; the point-band very fine.
Mr. Baker paid Bernini an hundred broad pieces for his, but for the
King's Bernini received a thou&s;and Roman crowns. The King was
&s;o plea&s;ed with his own, that he de&s;ired to have one of the Queen too;
but that was prevented by the war. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the church at Chel&s;ea is a fine monument in a niche for the Lady Jane Cheyney; &s;he is repre&s;ented lying on her right &s;ide, and leaning on a bible. This tomb was the work of Bernini, and co&s;t 500<HI>l.</HI></NOTE></P>

was a mau&s;oleum with arms, altar-tomb, columns and in&s;criptions in
honour of that Prince dated 1630. It is certain King Charles had no le&s;s
inclination for architecture than for the other arts. The intended pa|lace
at Whitehall would have been the mo&s;t truly magnificent and
beautifull fabric of any of the kind in Europe. His maje&s;ty did not
&s;end to Italy and Flanders for architects as he did for Albano and Van|dyck:
He had Inigo Jones. Under the direction of that genius the
King erected the hou&s;e at Greenwich.</P>
<P>Charles had in his &s;ervice another man, both architect and painter,
of whom, though excellent in neither branch, the reader will perhaps
not di&s;like &s;ome account, as he was a remarkable per&s;on and is little
known.</P>
<P>Sir Balthazar Gerbier D'ouvilly of Antwerp, was born about 1591,
came young into England, and was a retainer of the Duke of Bucking|ham
as early as 1613. In Finette's ma&s;ter of the ceremonies it is &s;aid,
"Alonzo Contarini Emba&s;&s;ador from Venice came to Mr. Gerbier, a
gentleman &s;erving the Duke of Buckingham." Sander&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graphice page 15.</NOTE> calls him
a common penman, who pen&s;iled the dialogue (probably the decalogue)
in the Dutch church London, his fir&s;t ri&s;e of preferment." It is cer|tain
that he ingratiated him&s;elf much with that favorite and attended
him into Spain, where he was even employed in the treaty of marriage,
though o&s;ten&s;ibly acting only in the character of a painter. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He painted &s;mall figures in di&s;temper. De Piles. While in Spain he drew the Infanta in miniature, which was &s;ent over to King James.</NOTE> Among

Tanner had a MS. catalogue of the Duke's collection drawn up by
Gerbier who had been employed by the Duke in &s;everal of the purcha|&s;es.
However there is &s;ome appearance of his having fallen into di&s;|grace
with his patron. In one of Vertue's MSS. is a pa&s;&s;age that &s;eems
to be an extract, though the author is not quoted, in which the Duke
treats Gerbier with the highe&s;t contempt. The tran&s;cript is &s;o ob&s;cure

<P>"King James I. ill and dying, the Duke of Buckingham was advi|&s;ed

to imprint his recantation, of which the Duke bid Gerbier join
malice and knavery together, and &s;pit their venom 'till they &s;plit, and
he would pay for printing that al&s;o."</P>
<P>Nothing can be built upon &s;o vague a foundation. It is certain that
immediately after the acce&s;&s;ion of King Charles, Gerbier was employed
in Flanders to negotiate privately a treaty with Spain, the very treaty
in which Rubens was commi&s;&s;ioned on the part of the Infanta, and for
which end that great painter came to England. Among the Conway|papers
I found a very curious and long letter from Gerbier him&s;elf on
this occa&s;ion, which though too prolix to in&s;ert in the body of this
work, I &s;hall affix at the end, not only as pertinent to my &s;ubject from
the part the&s;e painters had in &s;o important a bu&s;ine&s;s, but as it is more
particular than any thing I know in print on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Gerbier kept his ground after the death of Buckingham. In 1628
he was knighted at Hampton-court, and, as he &s;ays him&s;elf in one of
his books, was promi&s;ed by King Charles the office of &s;urveyor-general
of the works after the death of Inigo Jones.</P>
<P>In 1637 he &s;eems to have been employed in &s;ome other private
tran&s;actions of &s;tate, negotiating with the Duke of Orleans, the King's
brother, who was di&s;contented with the court. The Earl of Leice&s;ter,
Emba&s;&s;ador to Paris, writes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sidney papers vol. ii, p. 528. In one of his dedications mentioned hereafter, Gerbier puts this Lord in mind of his having been in a publick employment when his Lord&s;hip was at Paris: and De Piles &s;ays that the Duke of Buckingham find|ing him a man of good under&s;tanding, recommended him to the King, who &s;ent him as his agent to Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> to Mr. Secretary Windebank Nov. 24.

<P>"Sir Balthazar Gerbier's manife&s;tation of greater profits to be done

is &s;et forth that he having a commi&s;&s;ion to go there, &s;ettle and make
enquirys, he went to <HI>Cajana</HI> (Cayenne) with his family, and &s;ettled at
Surinam. A governor there from the Dutch had orders to &s;eize upon
him and all his papers and bring him back to Holland, which they did
in a very violent manner, breaking into his hou&s;e, killed one of his
children, endangered the lives of the re&s;t of his family, and narrowly
e&s;caped him&s;elf with his life, having a pi&s;tol charged at his brea&s;t if he
had re&s;i&s;ted. They brought him to Holland: He complained, but got
no redre&s;s, the &s;tates di&s;owning they had given any &s;uch orders. How|ever,
it was ju&s;t before the re&s;toration, and knowing the obligations he
had to England, they apprehended he might give the King notice of
the advantages might be gained by a &s;ettlement there."</P>
<P>This perhaps was one among the many provocations, which, meet|ing
his inclinations to France, led Charles II. into his impolitic, though
otherwi&s;e not wholly unju&s;tifiable, war with Holland, a people too apt
even in their depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, to hazard barbarous and brutal infraction
of treaties and humanity, when a glimp&s;e of commercial intere&s;t invites
it.</P>
<P>Gerbier probably returned to England with that Prince, for the tri|umphal
arches erected for his reception, are &s;aid to have been de&s;igned
by Sir Balthazar.</P>
<P>In France he publi&s;hed a book on fortification, and in 1662 at
London a &s;mall di&s;cour&s;e on magnificent buildings, dedicated to the
<PB N="65" REF="77">
King, in which he principally treats of &s;olidity, convenience and orna|ment,
and glances at &s;ome errors of Inigo Jones in the banquetting|hou&s;e.
Here too he mentions a large room built by him&s;elf near the
watergate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gate it&s;elf was de&s;igned by Inigo.</NOTE> at York-&s;tairs, thirty-five feet &s;quare, and &s;ays, that King
Charles I. being in it in 1628 at &s;ome repre&s;entation of &s;cenery, com|mended
it, and expre&s;&s;ed as much &s;atisfaction with it as with the ban|quetting-hou&s;e.
In the piece he propo&s;es to the Lords and Commons
to level the &s;treets, Fleet-bridge and Cheap&s;ide, and erect a &s;umptuous
gate at Temple-bar, of which he had pre&s;ented a draught to his ma|je&s;ty.
Before this book is a different print of him with a ribband and
a medal, in&s;cribed C. R. 1653. The medal I &s;uppo&s;e was given him
when appointed, as he &s;ays he was, Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies to
Charles I.</P>
<P>His portrait in one piece with Sir Charles Cotterel and Dob&s;on,
painted by the latter, is at Northumberland-hou&s;e; Gerbier has been
mi&s;taken in that picture for Inigo Jones. This piece was bought for
44<HI>l.</HI> at the &s;ale of Betterton, the player.</P>
<P>Gerbier's la&s;t piece is a &s;mall manual, intituled, Coun&s;el and Advice
to all builders, &amp;c. London 1663. A full half of this little piece is
wa&s;ted on dedications, of which there are no fewer than forty, and
which he excu&s;es by the example of Antonio Perez. They are ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to the Queen-mother, Duke of York, and mo&s;t of the principal
Nobility and Courtiers. The la&s;t is to his own di&s;ciple Captain Wil|liam
Wind. There is a heap of a kind of various knowledge even in
the&s;e dedications, and &s;ome curious things, as well as in the book it&s;elf,
particularly the prices of work and of all materials for building at that
time. In one place he ridicules the heads of lions, which are creeping

<P>The late Prince of Wales hearing of a capital picture by Vandyck
in Holland, to which various names of Engli&s;h families were given, as
Sir Balthazar Arundel, Sir Melchior Arundel, Sir Balthazar Bucking|ham,
or Sheffield, the la&s;t of which gained mo&s;t credit from a re&s;em|blance
in the arms, his Royal Highne&s;s gave a commi&s;&s;ion to purcha&s;e
it, and it was brought to Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e. It appeared that a celebrated
piece, for which Lord Burlington had bid 500<HI>l.</HI> at Lord Radnor's &s;ale,
and which Mr. Scawen <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was again expo&s;ed at Mr. Scawen's &s;ale, but bought in, and has &s;ince been purcha&s;ed by Samp&s;on Gideon.</NOTE> bought at a &s;till greater price was the &s;ame
with this picture, but not &s;o large nor containing &s;o many figures.
Mr. Scawen's had always pa&s;&s;ed for a mi&s;tre&s;s and children of the Duke
of Buckingham; but Vertue di&s;covered on that of the Prince of Wales
<PB N="67" REF="79">
an almo&s;t effaced in&s;cription, written by Vandyck's own hand, with
the&s;e words remaining, La famille de Balthazar&mdash;Chevalier; and he
&s;howed the Prince that the arms on a flower-pot were the &s;ame with
tho&s;e on two different prints of Gerbier, and allu&s;ive to his name, viz.
a chevron between three garbs or &s;heafs. There is a group of children
on the right hand, very inferior to the re&s;t of the compo&s;ition, and cer|tainly
not by Vandyck. The little girl leaning on the mother's knee
was originally painted by Rubens in a &s;eparate piece, formerly belong|ing
to Richard&s;on the painter, &s;ince that to General Skelton and Capt.
William Hamilton, and now in the collection of the Lord Vi&s;count
Spen&s;er. It is finer than the large picture&mdash;but it is time to return to
King Charles.</P>
<P>The academy erected by Gerbier was probably imitated from one
e&s;tabli&s;hed by Charles I. in the eleventh year of his reign and called
Mu&s;eum Minervae. The patent of erection is &s;till extant in the office
of the rolls. None but who could prove them&s;elves gentlemen were
to be admitted to education there, where they were to be in&s;tructed in
arts and &s;ciences, foreign languages, mathematics, painting, architec|ture,
riding, fortification, antiquities and the &s;cience of medals. Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
were appointed, and Sir Francis King&s;ton, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Francis King&s;ton, who &s;tyled him&s;elf Corporis Armiger, printed in 1635 a tran&s;lation into Latin ver&s;e of Chaucer's Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida.</NOTE> in who&s;e hou&s;e in
Covent-garden the academy was held, was named regent. There is a
&s;mall account of the de&s;ign of this academy, with it's rules and orders,
printed in 1636. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At the end of the little edition of Bu&s;bequius's Epi&s;tles printed at Oxford 1660, is the grant of a coat of arms to the regent and profe&s;&s;ors of the Mu&s;eum Minervae from Sir John Burroughs the herald, dated 1635, which arms are pre|fixed to the rules and orders of that e&s;tabli&s;hment printed 1636. Previous to it's being &s;et on foot, a committee had been appointed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, con&s;i&s;t|ing of the Duke of Buckingham and others, for taking into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the public &s;chools and method of education. What progre&s;s was made by this committee is not known, but probably the Mu&s;eum Minervae owed it's ri&s;e to it.</NOTE> But it fell to the ground with the re&s;t of the King's
<PB N="68" REF="80">
plans and attempts&mdash;and &s;o great was the inveteracy to him, that it
&s;eems to have become part of the religion of the time to war on the
arts, becau&s;e they had been countenanced at court. The parliament
began to &s;ell the pictures at York-hou&s;e &s;o early as 1645, but le&s;t the
nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs &s;hould not be thought &s;ufficient ju&s;tification,
they coloured it over with a piece of fanatic bigotry that was perfectly
ridiculous; pa&s;&s;ing the following votes among others July 23. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal of the Commons.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ordered, that all &s;uch pictures and &s;tatues there (York-hou&s;e) as are
without any &s;uper&s;tition, &s;hall be forthwith &s;old, for the benefit of Ire|land
and the North.</P>
<P>Ordered, that all &s;uch pictures there, as have the repre&s;entation of
the &s;econd per&s;on in trinity upon them, &s;hall be forthwith burnt.</P>
<P>Ordered, that all &s;uch pictures there, as have the repre&s;entation of

<P>This was a worthy contra&s;t to Archbi&s;hop Laud, who made a &s;tar|chamber-bu&s;ine&s;s
of a man who broke &s;ome painted gla&s;s in the cathe|dral
at Sali&s;bury. The cau&s;e of liberty was then, and is always, the
only cau&s;e that can excu&s;e a civil war: yet if Laud had not doated on
trifles, and the pre&s;byterians been &s;queami&s;h about them, I que&s;tion
whether the nobler motives would have had &s;ufficient influence to &s;ave
us from arbitrary power. They are the &s;lighte&s;t objects that make the
<PB N="69" REF="81">
deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the people. They &s;eldom fight for a liberty of
doing what they have a right to do, but becau&s;e they are prohibited or
enjoined &s;ome folly that they have or have not a mind to do. One co|mical
in&s;tance of the humour of tho&s;e times I find in Aubrey's hi&s;tory
of Surrey; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii, page 30.</NOTE> one Blee&s;e was hired for half-a-crown a day to break the
painted gla&s;s windows of the church of Croydon. The man probably
took care not to be too expeditious in the de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Immediately after the death <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I cannot help in&s;erting a &s;hort remark here, though foreign to the purpo&s;e. The very day after the execution of the King, was pa&s;&s;ed this vote, "Ordered, That the Lord Grey be de&s;ired, out of Haberda&s;her's-hall, to di&s;po&s;e of one hun|dred pounds for the &s;ervice of the commonwealth, <HI>as he &s;hall think fit</HI>: and that the committee at Haberda&s;her's-hall be required forthwith to pay the &s;ame to the &s;aid Lord Grey for that purpo&s;e." This order is &s;o covertly worded, without any particular application, at the &s;ame time that the &s;um is &s;o &s;mall for any public &s;ervice, that joined to the circum&s;tance of time and the known zeal of the pay|ma&s;ter, I cannot doubt but this was intended for the reward of the executioner. Mr. We&s;t has an authentic account of the execution, in which it is &s;aid, that Richard Brandon, the executioner, having &s;ound in the King's pocket an orange &s;tuck with cloves, was offered 20 &s;hillings for it; which he refu&s;ed, but &s;old it for ten on his way home.</NOTE> of the King, &s;everal votes were pa&s;&s;ed

in the &s;ale, was the cau&s;e that the collection fell into a variety
of low hands, and were di&s;per&s;ed among the painters and officers of
the late King's hou&s;hold, where many of them remained on &s;ale with
low prices affixed. The principal pieces were rated more highly, and
&s;ome of them were even &s;old above their valuation.</P>
<P>Ireton on the 2d of June 1648 reported the act for &s;ale, and mention
is made of &s;ome propo&s;ition of Captain Myldmay concerning the pic|tures
and &s;tatues, to be referred to the council of &s;tate. This propo&s;al
it &s;eems had been accepted but was revoked. Probably this per&s;on
might be an agent of Cromwell to prevent the di&s;per&s;ion. Cromwell
had greater matters to attend to; the &s;ale proceeded. Two years after|wards,
viz. in October and November 1650, the journals &s;peak of &s;ums
of money received from the &s;ale of the King's goods, and of various
applications of the money towards di&s;charge of his debts. From that
time I find no farther mention of the collection in the records.</P>

King's death ordered the crown and &s;ceptres, &amp;c. to be locked up.

A catalogue of the pictures, &s;tatues, goods, tape&s;tries and jewels,

<P>Some of the mo&s;t capital pictures were purcha&s;ed by the King of

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the havoc that had been made, it is plain from the

indeed were carried to Li&s;bon from Somer&s;et-hou&s;e by the Queen

of the &s;peaker, as it does of that of the relator. The Earl &s;eems to

<P>Sir PETER PAUL RUBENS.</P>
<P>ONE cannot write the life of Rubens without tran&s;cribing twenty
authors. The mo&s;t common books expatiate on a painter,
who&s;e works are &s;o numerous and &s;o well known. His pic|tures
were equally adapted to plea&s;e the ignorant and the conoi&s;&s;eurs.
Familiar &s;ubjects, familiar hi&s;tories, treated with great lu&s;tre and full|ne&s;s
of colouring, a richne&s;s of nature and propriety of draperies, re|commend
them&s;elves at fir&s;t &s;ight to the eyes of the vulgar. The ju&s;t
boldne&s;s of his drawing, the wonderfull chiaro &s;curo diffu&s;ed through|out
his pictures, and not loaded like Rembrandt's to force out one pe|culiar
&s;pot of light, the variety of his carnations, the fidelity to the cu&s;|toms
and manners of the times he was repre&s;enting, and attention to
every part of his compo&s;itions, without enforcing trifles too much or
too much neglecting them, all this union of happy excellencies endear
the works of Rubens to the be&s;t judges: he is perhaps the &s;ingle arti&s;t
who attracts the &s;uffrages of every rank. One may ju&s;tly call him the

<HI>popular painter</HI>; he wanted that maje&s;ty and grace which confine the
works of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters to the fewe&s;t admirers. I &s;hall be but
brief on the circum&s;tances of his life; he &s;taid but little here, in which
light only he belongs to this treati&s;e.</P>
<P> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This extract is chiefly made from Felibien. vol. iii. p. 404. from De&s;camps, p. 297. and Sandrart.</NOTE> His father was doctor of laws and &s;enator of Antwerp, which he
quitted on the troubles of that country and retired with his family to
Cologn, where on the fea&s;t of St. Peter and Paul his wife was delivered
of Rubens in 1577. Great care was taken of his education; he learned
and &s;poke Latin in perfection. When Antwerp was reduced by the
arms of Philip, Rubens the father returned to his native country.
The &s;on was grown up, and was well made. The Counte&s;s of Lalain
took him for her page, but he had too elevated a di&s;po&s;ition to throw
away his talents on &s;o di&s;&s;ipated a way of life. He quitted that &s;ervice,
and his father being dead, his mother con&s;ented to let him pur&s;ue his
pa&s;&s;ion for painting. Toby Verhae&s;t, a land&s;cape-painter, and Adam
Van Oort were his fir&s;t ma&s;ters, and then Otho Venius, under whom
he imbibed (one of his lea&s;t merits) a ta&s;te for allegory. The perplexed
and &s;illy emblems of Venius are well known. Rubens with nobler &s;im|plicity
is perhaps le&s;s ju&s;t in his. One may call &s;ome of his pictures
<HI>a toleration of all religions.</HI> In one of the compartments of the Luxem|burgh
gallery, a cardinal introduces Mercury to Mary de' Medici, and
Hymen &s;upports her train at the &s;acrament of marriage, before an al|tar
on which are the images of God the Father and Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See more on this &s;ubject at the end of Mr. Spence's Polymetis.</NOTE> At the
age of twenty-three Rubens &s;et out for Italy, and entered into the &s;er|vice
of Vincent Gonzaga Duke of Mantua. One day while he was at
<PB N="88" REF="101">
that court, and was painting the &s;tory of Turnus and Aeneas, intend|ing
to warm his imagination by the rapture of poetry, he repeated
with energy tho&s;e lines of Virgil. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No wonder his emulation was rai&s;ed at Mantua, where the works of Homer were treated by Raphael and Julio Romano.</NOTE>
<Q>Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet, &amp;c.</Q>
The Duke who over heard him and entered the chamber, was &s;urpriz|ed
to find the mind of his painter cultivated with a variety of gracefull
litterature. Rubens was named Envoy to Spain, and carried magnifi|cent
pre&s;ents to the favorite Duke of Lerma; exerting at that court his
political and elegant talents with a dignity and propriety that rai&s;ed
the latter without deba&s;ing the former. He conver&s;ed little with the
painters of that country except Vela&s;quez, with whom he continued a
corre&s;pondence of letters.</P>
<P>The fame of the young painter reached Don John of Braganza, af|terwards
King of Portugal, who invited him to Villa Vicio&s;a. Rubens
&s;et out with &s;uch a train, that the Duke apprehended the expence of
entertaining &s;o pompous a vi&s;itor, and wrote to &s;top his journey, ac|companying
the excu&s;e with a pre&s;ent of fifty pi&s;toles. The painter
refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent, &s;aid he had not propo&s;ed to paint, but to pa&s;s a
week at Villa Vicio&s;a, and had brought a thou&s;and pi&s;toles that he in|tended
to &s;pend there.</P>
<P>Returned to Mantua, the Duke &s;ent him to Rome to copy the
works of the great ma&s;ters. There he &s;tudied them, not what they
had &s;tudied, the ancients; Rubens was too carele&s;s of the antique as
Pou&s;&s;in copied it too &s;ervilely. The former &s;eemed never to have &s;een
a &s;tatue, the latter nothing el&s;e. The reputation of Titian and Paul
<PB N="89" REF="102">
Verone&s;e drew Rubens to Venice; there he was in his element, in the
empire of colours. There he learned to imitate nature; at Rome he
had mi&s;&s;ed the art of improving on it. If he has not the &s;implicity of
Titian, he has far more than Paul Verone&s;e. The buildings with
which he has enriched the back grounds of his compo&s;itions, do not
yield to tho&s;e of the latter; his land&s;capes are at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of
the former. Seldom as he practiced it, Rubens was never greater
than in land&s;cape; the tumble of his rocks and trees, the deep &s;hadows
in his glades and glooms, the watery &s;un&s;hine, and dewy verdure, &s;how
a variety of genius, which are not to be found in the inimitable but
uniform glow of Claud Lorrain.</P>
<P>Rubens was much wor&s;e employed at Genoa, where he drew mo&s;t
of their palaces, and cau&s;ed them to be engraved in two volumes.
How could a genius like his overlook the ruins of Rome, the de&s;igns
of Raphael and Michael Angelo, and the re&s;torers of ancient architec|ture
at Venice, and wa&s;te his time on the very moderate beauties that
he found at Genoa, where their greate&s;t art lay in crowding magnifi|cence
into a narrow and almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s &s;ituation? where mo&s;t of their
palaces can only be &s;een from a &s;edan chair!</P>
<P>His mother's illne&s;s drew him back to Antwerp, where the Arch|duke
Albert detained him, and where he married his fir&s;t wife Eliza|beth
Brants. He built a palace and painted it within and without.
His cabinet or rotunda was enriched with antique va&s;es, &s;tatues, me|dals
and pictures. The Duke of Buckingham &s;aw and coveted it. Le
Blond, whom I have mentioned in the life of Holbein, negotiated the
bargain, to which Rubens con&s;ented with regret. The favorite, who
was bent on the purcha&s;e, gave, it is &s;aid, ten thou&s;and pounds for what
had not co&s;t above a thou&s;and.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="103">
In Flanders he executed many great works, which created him as
many enemies. They affected to a&s;cribe to the &s;cholars whom he had
formed or been forced to take to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, as Jordaens, Van Uden,
Snyder, and Wildens, the merits of the ma&s;ter&mdash;but the greater the
talents of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, the higher the genius of the ma&s;ter. Do able
painters work under an indifferent one? Abraham Jan&s;&s;ens challenged
Rubens to a trial of their art; Rubens replied he would engage with
him, when Jan&s;&s;ens had proved him&s;elf worthy to be his competitor.
A more friendly offer was rejected by him with equal wit. A chymi&s;t
tendered him a &s;hare of his laboratory and of his hopes of the philo&s;o|pher's
&s;tone. Rubens carried the vi&s;ionary into his painting room, and
told him his offer was dated twenty years too late, "for &s;o long it is,
&s;aid he, &s;ince I found the art of making gold with my pallet and pen|cils."</P>
<P>From Antwerp he was called to Paris by Mary de' Medici, and
painted the o&s;ten&s;ible hi&s;tory of her life in the Luxemburgh. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that &s;he de&s;igned he &s;hould fill another gallery with the &s;tory of Henry IV. her hu&s;band, and that he had begun &s;everal of the compartments, but the troubles of that Prince&s;s prevented the execution. Abreg&egrave; de la vie des pein|tres. Vol. ii, p. 141.</NOTE> A pecu|liar
honour, as that Prince&s;s was an Italian. It is even &s;aid that he gave
her &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in drawing. If the prodigious number of large pieces
painted by Rubens were not te&s;timonies of the abundance and facility
of his genius, this gallery alone, compleated in three years, would de|mon&s;trate
it. As &s;oon as it was fini&s;hed, he returned to Antwerp,
where his various talents were &s;o con&s;picuous, that he was pitched upon
to negotiate a treaty of peace between Spain and England. The In|fanta
I&s;abella &s;ent him to Madrid for in&s;tructions, where he ingratiated
<PB N="91" REF="104">
him&s;elf &s;o much with the Conde-Due D'olivarez, that be&s;ides many
valuable pre&s;ents, he had a brevet for him&s;elf and his &s;on of &s;ecretary
of the Privy-council, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a &s;ecret commi&s;&s;ion to
King Charles, as I have mentioned before, in which he had the honour
of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>Neither Charles nor Rubens overlooked in the Emba&s;&s;ador the ta|lents
of the Painter. The King engaged him to paint the cieling of
the Banquetting-hou&s;e. The de&s;ign is the apotheo&s;is of King James,
for whom, when once deified, there &s;eems to have been no farther
thought of erecting a monument. The original &s;ketch for the middle
compartment is pre&s;erved at Houghton: It had belonged to Sir God|frey
Kneller, who often &s;tudied it, as is evident by Sir Godfrey's ori|ginal
&s;ketch, at Houghton too, for the great eque&s;trian picture of King
William at Hampton-court, though in the larger piece he &s;eems to
have forgot that he ever had &s;tudied the former de&s;ign. Sir Godfrey
had heard that Jordaens a&s;&s;i&s;ted Rubens in the execution; if true,
&s;ome of the compartments mu&s;t have been painted in Holland and
&s;ent over hither, for I do not find that Jordaens was ever in England.
Rubens received three thou&s;and pounds for his work. The building
it&s;elf co&s;t &s;eventeen thou&s;and pounds. What had it been, if compleat|ed!
Vandyck was to have painted the &s;ides with the hi&s;tory of the or|der
of the garter. Inigo Jones, Rubens, and Vandyck! Europe could
not have &s;hown a nobler chamber. Kent in the late reign repaired
the painting on the cieling.</P>
<P>During his re&s;idence here Rubens painted for the King a St.
George, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter in the Mu&s;eum dated March 6, 1630, it is &s;aid, "My Lord Car|li&s;le hath twice in one week mo&s;t magnificently fea&s;ted the Spani&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador and Mon&s;. Rubens al&s;o, the agent who prepared the way for his coming: who in honour of our nation hath drawn with his pencil the hi&s;tory of St. George, where|in (if it be po&s;&s;ible) he hath exceeded him&s;elf; but the picture he hath &s;ent home into Flanders to remain as a monument of his abode and employment here." This, I &s;uppo&s;e, was a repetition of the picture he drew for the King: One of them is now in the collection of the Earl of Lincoln.</NOTE> four feet high and &s;even feet wide.

the fir&s;t ornaments of Blenheim but have &s;uffered by neglect. At Wil|ton
are two; one, the A&s;&s;umption of the Virgin, painted for the Earl
of Arundel while Rubens was in England, and with which he was &s;o
plea&s;ed him&s;elf, that he afterwards made a large picture from it for a
convent at Antwerp. The other contains four children, Chri&s;t, an
Angel, St. John, and a girl repre&s;enting the church. This picture
which is far &s;uperior to the foregoing, and very fine, is &s;aid in the ca|talogue
to be allowed to be the be&s;t picture in England of Rubens; an
hyperbole indeed. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Kennedy's account of Wilton, p. 76. 79.</NOTE> At the Earl of Pomfret's at Ea&s;ton was a portrait
of Lodowic Duke of Richmond and Lenox. At Houghton is that
ma&s;terly piece, Mary Magdalen anointing the feet of Chri&s;t; and a
large cartoon of Meleager and Atalanta. There too are three pieces
in three different &s;tyles, in each of which he excelled, a land&s;cape; and
&s;atyrs; and lions. Animals, e&s;pecially of the &s;avage kind, he painted
beyond any ma&s;ter that ever lived. In his &s;atyrs, though highly co|loured
and with characteri&s;tic countenances, he wanted poetic imagina|tion.
They do not &s;eem a &s;eperate &s;pecies, but a compound of the
human and animal, in which each part is kept too di&s;tinct. His fe|male
&s;atyrs are &s;carce more indelicate than his women; one would
think that, like Swift, he did not intend that Yahoos &s;hould be too di&s;|criminate
from human nature; though what the &s;atyrist drew from
&s;pleen, flowed in the painter from an hone&s;t love of fle&s;h and blood.
There are be&s;ides in Lord Orford's collection the &s;ketches for the Car|dinal
Infant's entry into Antwerp, the family of Rubens by his &s;cholar
<PB N="94" REF="107">
Jordaens, and his &s;econd wife Helena Forman, a celebrated whole
length by Vandyck.</P>
<P>The fine picture of St. Martin the late Prince of Wales bought of
Mr. Bagnol, who brought it from Spain. It is remarkable that in
this piece Rubens has borrowed the head of an old man from the
cripple in one of the cartoons, of which I have &s;aid he gave informa|tion
to King Charles, who purcha&s;ed them. At Lord Spencer's at
Wimbleton is a fine portrait of Cardinal Howard. At Burleigh is an
Ebony Cabinet the front and Sides of which are painted by Rubens;
at one End are his three Wives, highly coloured.</P>
<P>I do not find how long Rubens &s;tayed in England, probably not
above a year. He died of the gout in his own country in 1640. A
catalogue of his works may be &s;een in De&s;camps. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o a li&s;t of the works of Rubens in Le Comte's cabinet des &s;ingularitez d' architecture, peinture, &amp;c. vol. i, p. 251.

<P>Mr. Maurice John&s;on of Spalding in Lincoln&s;hire, a great antiqua|rian,
produced to the Society of Antiquaries &s;ome years ago a MS.
containing di&s;cour&s;es and ob&s;ervations on human bodies, and on the
&s;tatues and paintings of the ancients and moderns, written partly in
Latin, partly in Italian, and &s;ome notes in Dutch, and illu&s;trated with
&s;everal drawings, as heads, attitudes, proportions, &amp;c. habits of Greeks
and Romans, various in&s;truments, uten&s;ils, armour, and head-dre&s;&s;es
from coins and &s;tatues, and compari&s;ons of Raphael, Michael Angelo
and others. It was an octavo pocket-book, and appeared to be an
exact copy of Rubens's Album, which he u&s;ed in his travels; the
drawings, and even hand-writing and different inks being exactly imi|tated
<PB N="95" REF="108">
This book was brought from Bru&s;&s;els by Capt. John&s;on, Mr.

<P>ABRAHAM DIEPENBECK,</P>
<P>among the various &s;cholars of Rubens, was one of the few that came
to England, where he was much employed by William Cavendi&s;h
Duke of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e managed hor&s;es he drew from the life, from
whence were engraved the cuts that adorn that Peer's book of hor&s;e|man&s;hip.
Several of the original pictures &s;till remain in the hall at
Welbeck. Diepenbeck drew views of the Duke's &s;eats in Nottingham|&s;hire
and Derby&s;hire, and portraits of the Duke, Duche&s;s, and his chil|dren,
and gave de&s;igns for &s;everal plates prefixed to the works of both
their Graces. "Diepenbeck, &s;ays De Piles, was born at Boi&s;leduc,
and in his youth was much employed in painting upon gla&s;s, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sandrart &s;ays he excelled all the other painters on gla&s;s.</NOTE> and en|tering
afterwards into the &s;chool of Rubens, became one of his be&s;t

in 1598, the only &s;on of a merchant, and of a mother, who was
admired for painting flowers in &s;mall, and for her needleworks in &s;ilk.
Vandyck was fir&s;t placed with Van Balen, who had &s;tudied at Rome,
and painted figures both in large and &s;mall; but the fame of Rubens
drew away to a nobler &s;chool the young congenial arti&s;t. The pro|gre&s;s
of the di&s;ciple &s;peedily rai&s;ed him to the glory of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the
works from which he learned. Fame that always &s;uppo&s;es jealou&s;y is
felt where there are grounds for it, attributes to Rubens an envy of
which his liberal nature I believe was incapable, and makes him advi&s;e
Vandyck to apply him&s;elf chiefly to portraits. I &s;hall &s;how that jea|lou&s;y,
at lea&s;t emulation, is rather to be a&s;cribed to the &s;cholar than to
the ma&s;ter. If Rubens gave the advice in que&s;tion, he gave it with rea|&s;on;
not maliciou&s;ly. Vandyck had a peculiar genius for portraits;
his draperies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;attins of which he was fond, particularly white and blue, are remarkably fini&s;hed; his back-grounds heavy, and have great &s;amene&s;s.</NOTE> are fini&s;hed with a minutene&s;s of truth not demanded in
hi&s;toric compo&s;itions; be&s;ides his invention was cold and tame, nor
does he any where &s;eem to have had much idea of the pa&s;&s;ions, and
their expre&s;&s;ion: Portraits require none. If Rubens had been jealous
of Vandyck, would he, as all their biographers agree he did, per&s;uade
him to vi&s;it Italy, whence him&s;elf had drawn his greate&s;t lights? Ad|di&s;on
did not advi&s;e Pope to tran&s;late Homer, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted Tickell in a

three hi&s;tories, and the famous portrait of the latter's wife, &s;et out for
Italy, and made his fir&s;t re&s;idence at Genoa. From thence he went to
Venice, which one may call the metropolis of the Flemi&s;h painters,
who &s;eem &s;o naturally addicted to colouring, that even in Italy they
&s;ee only with Flemi&s;h eyes. Vandyck imbibed &s;o deeply the tints of
Titian, that he is allowed to approach nearer to the carnations of that
ma&s;ter even than Rubens; Sir Anthony had more delicacy than the
latter, but like him never reached the grace and dignity of the antique.
He &s;eldom even arrived at beauty. His Madonnas are homely; his
ladies &s;o little flattered, that one is &s;urprized he had &s;o much cu&s;tom.
He has left us to wonder that the famous Counte&s;s of Carli&s;le could be
thought &s;o charming; and had not Waller been a better painter, Sa|chari&s;&s;a
would make little impre&s;&s;ion now. One excellence he had,
which no portrait-painter ever attained except Sir Godfrey Kneller;
the hands are often the fine&s;t part of his pictures.</P>
<P>He went to Rome and lived &s;plendidly, avoiding the low conver&s;a|tion
of his countrymen, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of the
<HI>Pittore Cavaliere&s;co.</HI> It was at Rome he drew that capital portrait of
Cardinal Bentivoglio, who having been Nuncio in Flanders, had a par|tiality
for their arti&s;ts, and as he celebrated their hi&s;tory with his pen,
was in return almo&s;t immortalized by one of their be&s;t pencils.</P>
<P>Vandyck, while at Rome, received an invitation to Palermo, and
went thither. There he painted Prince Philibert of Savoy, the Vice-Roy,
and a paintre&s;s of &s;ome name, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the Lord Spen&s;er's at Wimbledon is a good portrait of Sophoni&s;ba An|gui&s;ciola playing on a harp&s;ichord, painted by her&s;elf, and an old woman attend|ing her; on the picture is written, Ju&s;&s;u Patris. Lord A&s;hburnham has a &s;mall head of her in a round.</NOTE> Sophoni&s;ba Angui&s;ciola, then at

<PB N="98" REF="112">
he returned to Genoa, where he had gained the highe&s;t reputation,
and where he has left many con&s;iderable works.</P>
<P>He went back to Antwerp, and practiced both hi&s;tory and portrait.
Of the former kind were many applauded Altar-pieces; in the latter,
were particularly the heads of his cotemporary arti&s;ts. He drew them
in Chiaro &s;curo on &s;mall pannels, thirty-five of which are in the collec|tion
of the Counte&s;s of Cardigan at Whitehall. Admirable is the va|riety
of attitudes and airs of heads; but in tho&s;e pieces he meaned to
&s;urpa&s;s as well as record. The whole collection has been thrice
publi&s;hed; the fir&s;t edition by Vanden Enden contains four&s;core plates;
the &s;econd by Giles Hendrix, one hundred; the la&s;t by Verdu&s;&s;en,
who effaced the names and letters of the original engravers. Some of
the plates were etched by Vandyck him&s;elf. I &s;ay nothing of the
numbers of prints from his other works.</P>
<P>Hearing of the favour King Charles &s;howed to the arts, Vandyck
came to England, and lodged with his friend Geldorp, a painter,
hoping to be introduced to the King; it is extraordinary he was not.
He went away chagrined; but his maje&s;ty &s;oon learning what a trea|&s;ure
had been within his reach, ordered Sir Kenelm Digby, who had
&s;at to Vandyck, to invite him over. He came, and was lodged among
the King's arti&s;ts at Black-fryars, which Felibien, according to the
dignity of ignorance which the French affect, calls <HI>L'Hotel de Blaifore.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii, page 445.</NOTE>
Thither the King went often by water, and viewed his performances
with &s;ingular delight, frequently &s;itting to him him&s;elf, and be&s;peaking

At Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, the King and Queen, half lengths,
holding a crown of laurel between them. At Wind&s;or is a beautifull
half length of the Queen in white. Many portraits of her pretend to
be by Vandyck, but none are &s;o lovely as this. He two or three times
drew Prince Charles in armour &s;tanding. At Ken&s;ington in one piece
are Prince Charles, Prince James, and the Prince&s;s Mary; lately en|graved
by Strange. In the &s;ame palace is one of his fine&s;t works;
George Villiers, the &s;econd Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Francis
his brother, when children. Nothing can exceed the nature, lu&s;tre,
and delicacy of this &s;weet picture. At Houghton are two young
daughters of the Lord Wharton, admirable too, but rather inferior to
the foregoing. In Lord Orford's collection are &s;everal principal works <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a particular de&s;cription of the&s;e pictures in the Aedes Walpolianae.</NOTE>

Thomas Chaloner, governor of Prince Henry. Be&s;ides the&s;e my fa|ther
bought of the la&s;t Duke the whole collection of the Wharton fa|mily:
There were twelve whole lengths, the two girls, &s;ix half lengths,
and two more by Sir Peter Lely; he paid an hundred pounds each for
the whole lengths and the double picture, and fifty pounds each for
the half lengths. Mo&s;t of them were carried to Houghton, but &s;ome
not &s;uiting the places, were brought back, and &s;old for a trifle after
the death of my father. Tho&s;e that remain, are, King Charles, the

Some of the whole lengths were engraved by Van Gun&s;t.</NOTE></P>
<P>At Cornbury, the &s;eat of the Earls of Clarendon in Oxford&s;hire, was
a noble collection of portraits of the principal per&s;ons in the reign of
King Charles, many of which were drawn by Vandyck. The collec|tion
has &s;ince been divided between the Duche&s;s of Queen&s;berry, Lady
Hyde and Lady Mary Forbes, the heire&s;&s;es of the family. Several
others of his works are at the Earl of Denbigh's and at Lord Spen&s;er's
at Althrop. Among the latter, a celebrated double whole length of
the fir&s;t Duke of Bedford and the famous Lord Digby, afterwards
Earl of Bri&s;tol. The whole figure of the latter is good, and both the
heads fine; the body of Bedford is flat, nor is this one of his capital
works. Here too is a good picture of Daedalus and Icarus; half
lengths; a fine &s;urly impatience in the young man, and his body well
coloured. The Duke of Devon&s;hire has &s;ome good pictures by him;
at Chi&s;wick is the well known <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Burlington gave 1000<HI>l.</HI> for this picture at Paris, and had another of Luca Jordano into the bargain.</NOTE> Beli&s;arius, though very doubtfull if by

from Titian, and of Sophoni&s;ba Angui&s;ciola, mentioned above.</P>
<P>At Holkham is a large eque&s;trian picture of a Count D'Aremberg;
both the rider and hor&s;e are in his be&s;t manner; and at Earl Cowper's
a large piece of John Count of Na&s;&s;au and his family, lately engraved
by Baron.</P>
<P>Mr. Skinner, with the collection of the late Mr. Thomas Walker,
has a fine little picture of the Lady Venetia Digby, wife of Sir Kenelm;
though only a model for the large one at Wind&s;or; it is exqui&s;itely fi|ni&s;hed.
She is repre&s;ented as treading on Envy and Malice, and is
unhurt by a &s;erpent that twines round her arm. This galant compli|ment
is a little explained in the new life of Lord Clarendon, who men|tions
Sir Kenelm's marriage with a Lady, "though of an extraordinary
beauty, of as extraordinary fame." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is an elegy and epitaph on this Lady in Randolph's poems, page 28, in which her beauty is exceedingly commended. She was daughter and co-heire&s;s of Sir Edward Stanley, grand&s;on of Edward Earl of Derby, by the Lady Lucy Percy, daughter of Thomas Earl of Northumberland. Lady Venetia was found dead in her bed. Sir Kenelm erected for her a monument of black marble with her bu&s;t in copper gilt, and a lofty epitaph, in Chri&s;t-church without Newgate; but it was de&s;troyed in the fire of London. Lodge's peerage of Ireland. vol. iv, p. 89. There are two copper bu&s;ts of the Lady Venetia extant at Mr. Wright's at Gothur&s;t in Buckingham&s;hire, with &s;everal portraits of the family of Digby. The hou&s;e belonged to Sir Kenelm, and was purcha&s;ed by Sir Nathan Wright.</NOTE> Mr. Walker's collection was
chiefly cho&s;en for him by a &s;et of virtuo&s;i called Vandyck's or the club
of St. Luke, and it is plain from the pictures they recommended, that
they under&s;tood what they profe&s;&s;ed. There was another large piece
of Sir Kenelm, his lady and two children, in the collection of the Earl
<PB N="103" REF="117">
of Oxford; and a fine half length of Sir Kenelm alone is at Ken&s;ington.
Vandyck painted too for the King a twelfth Roman Emperor, to com|pleat
the &s;et of Titian, in the room of one which was &s;poiled and left
at Mantua. They co&s;t the King 100<HI>l.</HI> a piece, and after his death
were bought by the Spani&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador, the fir&s;t purcha&s;er of tho&s;e
effects. As the King's collection was embezzled or taken by his &s;er|vants
for their arrears, that mini&s;ter laid out 500<HI>l.</HI> in tho&s;e purcha&s;es

half figure of a Venus. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e and many other notices are taken from the Pocket-books of Richard Symonds of Black-Notley in E&s;&s;ex, gent. who was born at Okehampton, and was in the army of King Charles during the civil war, writing memoires of battles, actions, motions, and promotions of officers from time to time in &s;mall pocket-books; and through the &s;everal counties he pa&s;&s;ed, memorandums of churches, monuments, painted windows, arms, in&s;criptions, &amp;c. 'till January 1, 1648, when he left London, and travelled, fir&s;t to Paris, and then to Rome and Venice (al|ways continuing his memoires) where he &s;tayed 'till his return to England in 1652. Eight or ten of the&s;e books were in the Harleian library, two in that of Dr. Meade, and two or three in the herald's office, where is the pedigree of his family with his picture (probably) in red wax from a &s;eal, engraved by T. Simon, his name&s;ake, but no relation.</NOTE> The Flemings gave any price for the works
of Vandyck from that collection. Sir Peter Lely, as may be &s;een in
his catalogue, had &s;everal capital ones.</P>
<P>But it is at the Earl of Pembroke's at Wilton that Vandyck is on
his throne. The great Salon is entirely furni&s;hed by his hand. There
is that principal picture of Earl Philip and his family, which though
damaged, would &s;erve alone as a &s;chool of this ma&s;ter. Yet with great

It is &s;aid that the Earl of Pembroke had obtained leave to have a piece
of the whole royal family by the &s;ame hand as a companion to his
own.</P>
<P>At Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e is a double portrait, bought by the late Prince of
Wales of Mr. Bagnols. It repre&s;ents two of the wits of that time, T.
Carew, of the privy-chamber to Charles I. and a poet, and Henry

<P>He was much addicted to his plea&s;ures and expence; I have men|tioned
how well he lived. He was fond of mu&s;ick and generous to

hurt his fortune. He &s;ought to repair it, not like his ma&s;ter by the la|boratory
of his painting room, but by that real folly, the pur&s;uit of the
Philo&s;opher's &s;tone, in which perhaps he was encouraged by the ex|ample
or advice of his friend Sir Kenelm Digby. Towards the end of
his life the King be&s;towed on him for a wife, Mary the daughter of the
unfortunate Lord Gowry, which if meaned as a &s;ignal honour, might
be calculated too to depre&s;s the di&s;graced family by connecting them
with the blood of a painter. It is certain that the alliance does not &s;eem

it looks as if it had been accepted, though &s;ome &s;ay it was rejected,
on the extravagant price demanded by Vandyck: I would not &s;pecify
the &s;um, it is &s;o improbable, if I did not find it repeated in Fenton's
notes on Waller. It was four&s;core thou&s;and pounds! The civil war
prevented farther thoughts of it, as the death of Vandyck would have
interrupted the execution, at lea&s;t the completion of it. He died in
Black-fryars December 9, 1641, and was buried on the 11th in St.
Paul's near the tomb of John of Gaunt.</P>
<P>By Maria Ruthven his wife, he left one daughter married to Mr.
Stepney, a gentleman who rode in the hor&s;e-guards on their fir&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hment by Charles II. Their grand&s;on Mr. Stepney was Envoy
to &s;everal courts, and is known by his poems publi&s;hed in the collection
of the works of our minor poets. Sir John Stepney, another de&s;cen|dent,
<PB N="108" REF="122">
died on the road from Bath to Wales in 1748. Lady Vandyck
the widow was married again to Richard Pry&s;e &s;on of Sir John Pry&s;e
of Newton-Aberbecham in Montgomery&s;hire Knight. Richard, who
was created a Baronet Augu&s;t 9, 1641, was fir&s;t married to He&s;ther,
daughter of Sir Hugh Middleton; by Vandyck's widow he had no
i&s;&s;ue. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue a&s;certained the&s;e matches by books in the college os arms.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides his legitimate children Vandyck had a natural daughter
called Maria Tere&s;a, to whom, as appears by his will in Doctor's Com|mons,
he left four thou&s;and pounds, then in the hands of his &s;i&s;ter
Su&s;annah Vandyck in a convent at Antwerp, whom he appoints tru&s;|tee
for that daughter. To his &s;i&s;ter I&s;abella he bequeaths 250 guild|ers
yearly; and in ca&s;e his daughter Maria Tere&s;a die unmarried, he
entails 4000<HI>l.</HI> on another &s;i&s;ter, married to Mr. Derick, and her chil|dren.
To his wife Mary and his newborn daughter Ju&s;tiniana Anna
he gives all his goods, effects and monies, due to him in England from
King Charles, the Nobility, and all other per&s;ons whatever, to be equal|ly
divided between them. His executors are his wife, Mr. Aurelius
de Meghan, and Katherine Cowley, to which Katherine he leaves the
care of his daughter to be brought up, allowing ten pounds per ann.
'till &s;he is eighteen years of age. Other legacies he gives to his exe|cutors
and tru&s;tees for their trouble, and three pounds each to the poor
of St. Paul's and St. Anne's Black-friar's, and to each of his &s;ervants
male and female.</P>
<P>The war prevented the punctual execution of his will, the probate
of which was not made 'till 1663, when the heirs and executors from
abroad and at home a&s;&s;embled to &s;ettle the accounts and recover what
<PB N="109" REF="123">
debts they could&mdash;but with little effect. In 1668, and in 1703, the
heirs, with Mr. Carbonnel who had married the daughter of Vandyck's
daughter, made farther in&s;pections into his affairs and demands on his
creditors, but what was the i&s;&s;ue does not appear.</P>

<P>GEORGE GELDORP,</P>
<P>of Antwerp, a countryman and friend of Vandyck, in who&s;e hou&s;e
that painter lodged at his fir&s;t arrival, had been &s;ettled here &s;ome time
before. He could not draw him&s;elf, but painted on &s;ketches made by
others, and was in repute even by this artificial practice; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to include his portraits, for which he certainly would have had no cu&s;tom, if the per&s;ons had been obliged to &s;it to two different men. A painter may execute a head, tho' he cannot compa&s;s a whole figure. A print by Voer&s;t of James Stewart Duke of Lenox, with Geo. Geldorp pinx. is indubitable proof that the latter painted portraits.</NOTE> though Vertue
was told by Mr. Ro&s;e that it was not his mo&s;t lucrative employment,
his hou&s;e being reckoned convenient for the intrigues of people of
fa&s;hion. He fir&s;t lived in Drury-lane in a large hou&s;e and garden
rented from the crown at 30<HI>l.</HI> per ann. and afterwards in 1653
in Archer-&s;treet. He had been concerned in keeping the King's
pictures, and when Sir Peter Lely fir&s;t came over, he worked for Gel|dorp,
who lived 'till after the re&s;toration, and was buried at We&s;tmin|ster.
Another of the apprentices of Geldorp was</P>
<P>ISAAC SAILMAKER</P>

Mardyke. A print of the confederate fleet under Sir George Rooke
<PB N="111" REF="125">

in 1714 from a de&s;ign of Sailmaker, who lived to the age of
eighty-eight, and died June 28, 1721.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> BRADSHAW</P>
<P>was another painter in the reign of Charles I. whom I only mention
with other ob&s;olete names to lead inquirers to farther di&s;coveries. All
I find of him is a note from one of the pocket-books of R. Symonds
above-mentioned, who &s;ays, "Pierce in Bi&s;hopgate-&s;treet told me that
Brad&s;haw is the only man that doth under&s;tand per&s;pective of all the

<P>B. VAN BASSEN</P>
<P>of Antwerp, was a very neat painter of architecture. In the private
apartment below &s;tairs at Ken&s;ington are two pictures by him; in one
are repre&s;ented Charles I. and his Queen at dinner; in the other the
King and Queen of Bohemia, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their initial letters F.

bought by her father the Earl of Oxford from the Arundelian collec|tion
at Tart-hall. On each of the drawers is a &s;mall hi&s;tory by Polen|burg,
and pieces of architecture in the manner of Steenwyck by this
Van Ba&s;&s;en, who mu&s;t not be confounded with the Italian Ba&s;&s;ans, nor
with the Ba&s;&s;anos, who were mu&s;icians to Charles, and of which name
there was al&s;o a herald-painter. The fir&s;t Ba&s;&s;ano, who came hither in
<PB N="112" REF="126">
the reign of Queen Elizabeth and was related to the Italian painters of
that name, &s;ettled in E&s;&s;ex and purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate, which was &s;old in
1714 by the male de&s;cendent. In the man&s;ion was a portrait of the
mu&s;ician, holding a ba&s;s-viol. It is now at Narford in Norfolk, the
&s;eat of the late Sir Andrew Fountain.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS POLENBURG</P>
<P>the &s;weet painter of little land&s;capes and figures, was born at Utrecht
in 1586, and educated under Bloemart, whom he &s;oon quitted to tra|vel
to Italy, as he abandoned, &s;ay our books, the manner of El&s;heimer
to &s;tudy Raphael&mdash;but it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay where they find Raphael
in Polenburg. The latter formed a &s;tyle entirely new, and though
preferable to the Flemi&s;h, unlike any Italian, except in having adorned
his land&s;capes with ruins. There is a varni&s;hed &s;moothne&s;s and fini&s;h|ing
in his pictures that makes them always plea&s;ing, though &s;imple
and too nearly re&s;embling one another. The Roman Cardinals were
charmed with the neatne&s;s of his works; &s;o was the great Duke, but
could not retain him. He returned to Utrecht and plea&s;ed Rubens
who had &s;everal of his performances. King Charles invited him to
London, where he lived in Archer-&s;treet next door to Geldorp, and ge|nerally
painted the figures in Steenwyck's per&s;pectives. There is a
very curious picture at Earl Poulet's at Hinton St. George, repre&s;ent|ing
an in&s;ide view of Theobald's, with figures of the King, Queen, and
the two Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, William and Philip.
This piece is probably of Steenwyck, and the figures, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In King Charles's catalogue are mentioned the portraits of his maje&s;ty, and of the children of the King of Bohemia, by Polenburg: and in King James's are eight pieces by him.</NOTE> which are co|pied

which he altered for King Charles. It is the portrait of the &s;on, that

in England al&s;o, painted for King Charles, and probably died here.</P>
<P>JOHN TORRENTIUS</P>
<P>of Am&s;terdam, is known to have been here, not by his works, but
on the authority of Schrevelius, in his hi&s;tory of Arlem, from whom
De&s;camps took his account. Torrentius, &s;ays the latter, painted admi|rably
in &s;mall, but his &s;ubjects were not calculated to procure him ma|ny
avowed admirers. He painted from the lectures of Petronius and
Aretine, had the confidence to dogmatize on the &s;ame &s;ubjects, and
practiced at lea&s;t what he preached. To profligacy he added impiety,
'till the magi&s;trates thought proper to put a &s;top to his boldne&s;s. He
underwent the que&s;tion, and was condemned to an impri&s;onment of
twenty years; but obtained his liberty by the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome men
of quality, and particularly of the Engli&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador&mdash;what the
name of the latter was we are not told. Torrentius came over to
England, but giving more &s;candal than &s;atisfaction, he returned to
Am&s;terdam, and remained there concealed 'till his death in 1640, aged

<P>GEORGE JAMESONE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The materials of this article were communicated by Mr. John Jami&s;one, wine-merchant in Leith, who has another portrait of this painter by him&s;elf, 12 inches by 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>was the Vandyck of Scotland, to which title he had a double preten|&s;ion,
not only having &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his countrymen as a portrait-painter,
but from his works being &s;ometimes attributed to Sir Antony, who

<P>Jame&s;one was &s;on of Andrew Jame&s;one, an architect, and was born
at Aberdeen in 1586. At what age he went abroad, or how long he
continued there, is not known. After his return, he applied with inde|fatigable
indu&s;try to portrait in oil, tho' he &s;ometimes practiced in mi|niature,
and in hi&s;tory and land&s;cape too. His large&s;t portraits <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His earlie&s;t works are chiefly on board, afterwards on a fine linen cloth, &s;moothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his &s;hadows. His be&s;t works were from 1630 to his death.</NOTE>
were generally &s;omewhat le&s;s than life. His excellence is &s;aid to con|&s;i&s;t
in delicacy and &s;oftne&s;s, with a clear and beautifull colouring, his
&s;hades not charged, but helped by varni&s;h, with little appearance of
the pencil. There is a print of him, his wife I&s;abella To&s;h and a
young &s;on, painted by him&s;elf in 1623, engraved by Alexander Jame|&s;one,
his de&s;cendent, in 1728, and now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. John

portraits of the family, painted by George; particularly another of
him&s;elf in his &s;chool, with &s;ketches both of hi&s;tory and land&s;cape, and
with portraits of Charles 1&s;t. his Queen, Jame&s;one's wife, and four
others of his works from the life.</P>
<P>When King Charles vi&s;ited Scotland in 1633, the magi&s;trates of
Edinburgh, knowing his maje&s;ty's ta&s;te, employed Jame&s;one to make
drawings of the Scotti&s;h monarchs, with which the King was &s;o much
plea&s;ed, that inquiring for the painter, he &s;at to him and rewarded him
with a diamond ring from his own finger.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that Jame&s;one always drew him&s;elf with his hat on,
either in imitation of his ma&s;ter Rubens, or on having been indulged
in that liberty by the King when he &s;at to him.</P>
<P>Though mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable families in Scotland are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of works by this ma&s;ter, the greate&s;t collection of them is at Tay|mouth,
the &s;eat of the Earl of Breadalbane; Sir Colin Campbell of
Glenorchy, his Lord&s;hip's ance&s;tor, having been the chief and earlie&s;t
patron of Jame&s;one, who had attended that gentleman on his travels.
From a MS. on vellom, containing the genealogy of the hou&s;e of
Glenorchy, begun in 1598, are taken the following extracts, written
in 1635, page 52;</P>
<P>"Item, The &s;aid Sir Coline Campbell (8th. Laird of Glenorchy)
gave unto George Jame&s;one, painter in Edinburgh, for King Robert
and King David Bruy&s;&s;es, Kings of Scotland, and Charles the 1&s;t King
of Great Brittane France and Ireland, and his Maje&s;ties Quein, and for
nine more of the Queins of Scotland their portraits, quhilks are &s;et up
in the hall of Ballock [now Taymouth] the &s;um of tua hundreth thrie
&s;cor punds."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="135">
"Mair the &s;aid Sir Coline gave to the &s;aid George Jame&s;one for
the Knight of Lockow's Lady, and the fir&s;t Counte&s;s of Argylle, and
&s;ix of the Ladys of Glenurquhay their portraits, and the &s;aid Sir Co|line
his own portrait, quhilks are &s;et up in the chalmer of Dea&s;s of Bal|lock,
ane hundreth four &s;coire punds."</P>
<P>Memorandum. In the &s;ame year 1635 the &s;aid George Jame&s;one
painted a large genealogical tree of the family of Glenorchy, 8 feet
long and 5 broad, containing in miniature the portraits of Sir Duncan
Campbell of Lockow, of Archibald Campbell his elde&s;t &s;on, fir&s;t Earl
of Argylle, and of Sir Coline Campbell his &s;econd &s;on, fir&s;t Laird of
Glenorchy, together with the portraits of eight &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Knights,
Lairds of Glenorchy, with the branches of their inter-marriages, and
of tho&s;e of their &s;ons and daughters, beautifully illuminated. At the
bottom of which tree the following words are painted on a &s;croll;
"The genealogie of the Hous of Glenurquhie, whereof is de&s;cendit
&s;undrie nobill and worthie hou&s;es, 1635, <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ame&s;one faciebat."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the foregoing, Lord Breadalbane has at Taymouth, by the
&s;ame hand, eleven portraits of Lords and Ladies of the fir&s;t families
in Scotland, painted in 1636 and 1637.</P>
<P>From the extract above, it appears that Jame&s;one received no more
for each of tho&s;e heads than twenty pounds Scots, or one pound thir|teen
&s;hillings and four-pence Engli&s;h: Yet it is proved by their pu|blick
records that he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ea&s;y fortune, which he left
to his three daughters, two of whom were honorably married. One
of them, named Mary, di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf by admirable needlework,
a piece of which u&s;ed to be exhibited on fe&s;tivals in the Church of St.
Nicholas at Aberdeen. Her de&s;cendent Mr. Thom&s;on of Portlethem
has an original picture of her father by him&s;elf. Three &s;mall portraits
<PB N="119" REF="136">
of the hou&s;e of Haddington are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Thomas Hamilton
E&s;q. of Fala.</P>
<P>Many of Jame&s;one's works are in both colleges of Aberdeen. The
Sibyls there, it is &s;aid, he drew from living beauties of that city. Mr.
Baird of Auchmedden in Aberdeen&s;hire has in one piece three young
Ladies, cou&s;ins, of the hou&s;es of Argyle, Errol and Kinnoul, their
ages, &s;ix, &s;even and eight, as marked on the &s;ide of the picture. The
&s;ame Gentleman has a &s;mall whole length of William Earl of Pem|broke,
by &s;ome a&s;cribed to Vandyck. At Mr. Lind&s;ay's of Worme|&s;ton
in Fife is a double half length of two boys, of that family, play|ing
with a dog, their ages five and three, 1636.</P>
<P>There is a per&s;pective view of Edinburgh by Jame&s;one, with a
Neptune on the fore ground.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed a fine whole length of Charles I. he expected the
magi&s;trates of Aberdeen would purcha&s;e it for their hall, but they of|fering
him too incon&s;iderable a price, he &s;old it to a gentleman in the
north of England.</P>
<P>Jame&s;one had many &s;cholars, particularly Michael Wright, men|tioned
in the third Volume of the&s;e Anecdotes. His own portrait is
in the Florentine chamber of Painters.</P>
<P>Though Jame&s;one is little known in England, his character as well
as his works were greatly e&s;teemed in his own country. Arthur John|&s;ton,
the Poet, addre&s;&s;ed to him an elegant Epigram on the picture of
the Marchione&s;s of Huntley, which may be &s;een in the works of that
author printed at Middleburgh in 1642. The portrait it&s;elf is ex|tant
in the collection of the Duke of Gordon; and in the Newton-|college
of Aberdeen is the picture of Doctor John&s;ton him&s;elf by the
&s;ame hand. A Latin Elegy compo&s;ed by David Wedderburn was
<PB N="120" REF="137">
printed on his death, which happened in 1644 at Edinburgh, where
he was interred in the church-yard by the Gray-friars, but without any
monument.</P>
<P>By his will, written with his own hand in July 1641, and breathing
a &s;pirit of much piety and benevolence, he provides kindly for his wife
and children, and leaves many legacies to his relations and friends,
particularly to Lord Rothes the King's picture from head to foot, and
Mary with Martha in one piece: to William Murray he gives the
medals in his coffer, makes a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for his natural
daughter, and be&s;tows liberally on the poor. That he &s;hould be in a
condition to do all this, &s;eems extraordinary, his prices having been

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. Symonds &s;ays he learned mo&s;t of Old Cleyn.</NOTE> to Sir Robert Peake, whom I have mentioned, a painter and
dealer in pictures. Under him, though no excellent performer, but
by the advantage of copying &s;ome pictures of Titian and Vandyck,
Dob&s;on profited &s;o much, that a picture he had drawn being expo&s;ed
in the window of a &s;hop on Snow-hill, Vandyck pa&s;&s;ing by was &s;truck
with it, and inquiring for the author, found him at work in a poor
garret, from whence he took him and recommended him to the King.
On the death of Vandyck, Dob&s;on was appointed Serjeant-painter,
and groom of the privy-chamber, and attended the King to Oxford,
and lodged in the high-&s;treet almo&s;t over again&s;t St. Mary's church in
a hou&s;e where &s;ome of his works remained 'till of late years. At Oxford

It was, obliging per&s;ons who &s;at to him to pay half the price down; and that he was the fir&s;t who u&s;ed this practice. By the &s;warms of portraits that are left on the hands of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, this method is either neglected, or has very little effect!</NOTE> &s;at to him;
but the declen&s;ion of the King's affairs proved fatal to Dob&s;on; he
loved his plea&s;ures, and not having had time to enrich him&s;elf, was
involved in debts and thrown into pri&s;on, from whence he was deli|vered
by one Mr. Vaughan of the Exchequer, who&s;e picture he drew
and thought it the be&s;t of his portraits. He enjoyed this relea&s;e but a
&s;hort time; dying at the age of thirty-&s;ix, he was buried at St. Martin's
October 28, 1646. A &s;hort life, in which he had promi&s;ed much ex|cellence.
His pictures are thought the be&s;t imitations of Vandyck;
they are undoubtedly very faithfull tran&s;cripts of nature. He painted
<PB N="122" REF="140">
hi&s;tory as well as portrait; and even the latter generally containing
more than a &s;ingle figure, ri&s;e almo&s;t above that denomination.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t &s;ort, is the Decollation of St. John at Wilton. It is in a
good &s;tyle, but the colouring is raw. The idea of St. John is &s;aid
to have been taken from the face of Prince Rupert. At Chat&s;worth
is a very particular picture, &s;aid to be General Monke, his child, and
his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he took again&s;t the con&s;ent of her hu&s;band. The
man in armour, undoubtedly re&s;embles Monke, but the whole piece has
the air of a holy family; nor is there any other tradition of any mi&s;tre&s;s
of Monke, but the famous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of her in Lord Clarendon's hi&s;tory of his life, in Ludlow's memoires, and in the collection of &s;tate poems, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE> Anne Clarges whom he afterwards mar|ried,
and who, &s;ome &s;ay, was a milliner. There are many in&s;tances of
painters who have deified their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but the character of the Vir|gin
Mary was never more pro&s;tituted, than if a&s;&s;umed by Anne Clar|ges.
Mr. Stanley has a picture extremely like this, by <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ words">. At
Albury in Surrey, the &s;eat of the Earl of Arundel, was a picture by
Dob&s;on of the woman caught in adultery, with &s;everal figures; the
heads taken from per&s;ons then living, among whom was the poet
Cowley. At Chippenham, in Cambridge&s;hire, formerly the &s;eat of
Ru&s;&s;el Earl of Orford, in one piece are Prince Rupert, Colonel John
Ru&s;&s;el and Mr. William Murray drinking, and dipping their favour-ribbands
in the wine. At Blenheim, is a family, by &s;ome &s;aid to be
that of Francis Carter, an architect and &s;cholar of Inigo Jones; by
others of Lilly the A&s;trologer, whom Vertue thought it re&s;embled. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">But Whitlocke &s;ays that Lilly had no family.</NOTE>
The man holds a pair of compa&s;&s;es. I have &s;een nothing of Dob&s;on

Medici, his wife, two &s;ons and as many daughters. Mr. Willett,
merchant in Thames-&s;treet, has a &s;mall family-piece of Dr. Hibbard,
phy&s;ician, his wife and five children. The father and mother are par|ticularly
well painted. A little boy leans on the father's knee, evi|dently
borrowed from the well-known attitude by Rubens of Sir B.
Gerbier's daughter. Two children on the right-hand were certainly
added afterwards, and are much inferior to the re&s;t. The dates were
probably in&s;erted at the &s;ame time. A whole length of Sir William
Compton is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family. At the Lord Byron's is
the portrait of Sir Charles Lucas; and at Drayton in Northampton|&s;hire,
Henry Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough in armour with a page
holding his hor&s;e, and an angel giving him his helmet. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The la&s;t circum&s;tance may relate to his pre&s;ervation in the Civil War, in which he was wounded, and made his e&s;cape when taken pri&s;oner with Duke Hamilton and Lord Holland.

the Marquis of Montro&s;e was taken for the hand of Vandyck: in a
corner in &s;tone colour is a &s;tatue of peace, on the other &s;ide, his helmet.
At Mr. Skinner's (Mr. Walker's collection) is a large piece of Prince
Charles in armour, drawn about 1638, Mr. Windham, a youth, hold|ing
his helmet; at bottom are arms and trophies. I have mentioned
a fine head of Vanderdort at Houghton. Dob&s;on's wife, by him, is
on the &s;tairs of the A&s;hmolean mu&s;eum at Oxford; and his own head
is at Earl Paulett's; the hands were added long &s;ince by Gib&s;on, as he
him&s;elf told Vertue. Charles Duke of Somer&s;et had a picture of an old

King, was engaged by his maje&s;ty to tran&s;late Davila's hi&s;tory of the

and that he left England and went to Venice in 1627. I find no
other authority for this account: not one work of Sandrart is mention|ed

became known to Sir Henry Wotton, and Sir Robert An&s;truther re|commended
him to Prince Charles. He arrived while the Prince was
in Spain, but notwith&s;tanding was graciou&s;ly received by King James,
who mentions that circum&s;tance in a Latin letter that he wrote to the
King of Denmark, de&s;iring leave to detain Cleyn in England, though
with a permi&s;&s;ion to return fir&s;t to Copenhagen and fini&s;h a work he
had begun there, and promi&s;ing to pay the expence of his journey.
The letter is pre&s;erved by Fuller. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Worthies of Surrey, p. 77.</NOTE> The reque&s;t was granted, and
Cleyn returned to London at the end of the &s;ummer. The King had
ju&s;t then given two thou&s;and pounds towards Sir Francis Crane's new
manufacture of tape&s;try at Mortlack. They had worked only after
old patterns; Cleyn was placed there, and gave de&s;igns both in hi&s;tory
and grote&s;que, which carried tho&s;e works to &s;ingular perfection. It ap|pears
by King Charles's catalogue that five of the cartoons were &s;ent

Rymer. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. xviii, p. 112.</NOTE> "Know yee that we do give and graunt unto Francis Cleyne a certain annuitie of one hundred pounds by the year during his natural
life." He enjoyed this &s;alary 'till the civil war; and was in &s;uch favour
with the King and in &s;uch reputation, that on a &s;mall drawing of him
in Indian ink about &s;ix inches &s;quare, which Vertue &s;aw, he is called,
Il famo&s;i&s;&s;imo pittore France&s;co Cleyn, miracolo del &s;ecolo, e molto
&s;timato del re Carlo della gran Britania, 1646." Cleyn was not em|ployed
&s;olely in the works at Mortlack; he had a hou&s;e near the church
in Covent-garden, and did &s;everal other things for the King and Nobi|lity.
At Somer&s;et-hou&s;e he painted a cieling of a room near the gal|lery
with hi&s;tories and compartments in gold. The out&s;ide of Wimble|don-hou&s;e
he painted in fre&s;co. Bol&s;over in Nottingham&s;hire, Stone|park
in Northampton&s;hire, and Carew-hou&s;e at Par&s;on's-green (&s;ince
Lord Peterborough's) were ornamented by him. There is &s;till extant
a beautifull chamber adorned by him at Holland-hou&s;e, with a cieling
in grote&s;que, and &s;mall compartments on the chimnies, in the &s;tyle and
not unworthy, of Parmegiano. Two chairs, carved and gilt, with large
&s;hells for backs, belonging to the &s;ame room, were undoubtedly from
his de&s;igns; and are evidences of his ta&s;te. A letter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strafford papers.</NOTE> from Lord
Cottington to Lord Strafford, de&s;cribing the former's hou&s;e at Han|worth,
mentions Cleyn, though not by name. "There is a certain large
low room made under the building with a fountain in it, and other rare
devi&s;es, and the open gallery is all painted by the hand of a &s;econd
Titian. Aug. 1629." In King Charles's catalogue is mention of four
<PB N="146" REF="172">
patterns for the great &s;eal, drawings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed that &s;ome drawings by Cleyn are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl of Moray in Scotland.</NOTE> on blue paper by Cleyn. He
made de&s;igns for various arti&s;ts; particularly for &s;everal of Hollar's
plates to Virgil and Ae&s;op: for the&s;e he received fifty &s;hillings a piece.
There are two &s;mall books of foliages from his drawings; one contain|ing
&s;ix &s;mall &s;lips with animals in grote&s;que; the other, in five &s;lips, of
the &s;en&s;es; and the initial letters of his name F. C. inv. 1646. And
two books for carvers, gold&s;miths, &amp;c. containing 25 plates. It is
however uncertain whether the&s;e and a few other plates of the &s;ame
kind are not by his &s;on, who had the &s;ame chri&s;tian name, and imita|ted
his father's manner. Such is a title-page to Lacrymae Mu&s;arum,
elegies on the Lord Ha&s;tings, who died in 1650, the day before he
was to have been married. Al&s;o, &s;even plates of the liberal arts, about
four or five inches &s;quare, prettily de&s;igned and neatly etched. On a
&s;mall print of the father, etched by the &s;on, Mr. Evelyn wrote, "A
mo&s;t pious man, father of two &s;ons, who were incomparable painters
in miniature; all died in London." By the regi&s;ter of Mortlack it ap|pears
that he had three &s;ons; Francis born in 1625, who died and was
buried at Covent-garden October 21, 1650. Charles and John; and
two daughters, Sarah and Magdalen. He had another daughter, pro|bably
born in London, and called Penelope. Vertue &s;aw a miniature,
like Cooper's manner, but not &s;o well, of Dorothea, younge&s;t daughter
of Richard Cromwell, act. 4, 1668, with the&s;e letters, P. C. which he

pocket-books mentions another piece of Cleyn and his family by can|dlelight,
and a copy by the &s;on of a &s;acrifice from Raphael, which was
in the royal collection, and a drawing on coloured paper. At Ken|&s;ington
I have lately found a picture which I do not doubt is of Cleyn's
hand. It repre&s;ents Chri&s;t and Mary in a chamber, the walls and
windows of which are painted in grote&s;que. Different rooms are &s;een
through the doors, in one I &s;uppo&s;e is Martha employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s
of the family. There is merit in this piece, particularly in the per|&s;pective
and grote&s;ques, the latter of which, and the figures in the
manner of the Venetian &s;chool, make me not he&s;itate to a&s;cribe it to
this ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>JOHN HOSKINS.</P>
<P>For the life of this valuable ma&s;ter I find fewer <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is not even a portrait of him extant.</NOTE> materials, than of
almo&s;t any man in the li&s;t who arrived to &s;o much excellence. Vertue
knew no more of him than what was contained in Graham's Engli&s;h
School, where we are only told "that he was bred a face-painter in oil,
but afterwards taking to miniature, far exceeded what he did before;
that he drew King Charles, his Queen and mo&s;t of the court, and had
two con&s;iderable di&s;ciples, Alexander and Samuel Cooper, the latter of
whom became much the more eminent limner." Ho&s;kins, though

&s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his &s;cholar, the younger Cooper, was a very good painter;
there is great truth and nature in his heads; but the carnations are too
bricky, and want a degradation and variety of tints. I have a head of
&s;erjeant Maynard by him, boldly painted and in a manly &s;tyle, though
not without the&s;e faults; and another good one of Lord Falkland,
more de&s;criptive of his patriot melancholy than the common prints; it
was in the collection of Dr. Meade. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Burleigh is a portrait of David Cecil, &s;on of John 4th.

<P>ANNE CARLISLE,</P>
<P>a paintre&s;s, admired for her copies (it is not &s;aid whether in oil or mi|niature)
from Italian ma&s;ters. Graham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Engli&s;h School.</NOTE> &s;ays, &s;he was in &s;uch favour

ultramarine at one time as co&s;t him above five hundred pounds. If her
&s;hare was near equal, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;he painted in oil. It would be
a very long time before the worth of 200<HI>l.</HI> in ultramarine could be
employed in miniatures. Vertue mentions her teaching a lady to paint,
who&s;e picture &s;he drew &s;tanding behind her own; her&s;elf was &s;itting
with a book of drawings in her lap; and he adds, that many pieces
painted by her were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a widow Lady Cotterel. Mrs.
Carli&s;le died about 1680.

</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="176">JOHN PETITOT</P>
<P>was patronized by the two monarchs, who of late years have given the
noble&s;t encouragement to arti&s;ts, Charles 1&s;t. and Louis 14th. He
de&s;erved their protection as a genius, and has never been equalled in
enamel. Zincke alone has once or twice, and but once or twice, pro|duced
works that might &s;tand in competition with any &s;ingle per|formance
of Petitot.</P>
<P>The latter was born at Geneva in 1607; his father, a &s;culptor and
architect, having pa&s;&s;ed part of his life in Italy, had retired to
that city. The &s;on was de&s;igned for a jeweller, and having frequent
occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of enamel, he attained &s;uch a tone of colour, that
Bordier, who afterwards became his brother-in-law, conceived, that if
Petitot would apply him&s;elf to portrait, he might carry the art to great
perfection. Though both wanted &s;everal colours, which they knew
not how to prepare for the fire, their attempts had great &s;ucce&s;s. Pe|titot
executed the heads and hands, Bordier, the hair, draperies and
grounds.</P>
<P>In this intercour&s;e of &s;ocial labour, the two friends &s;et out for Italy.
As painters, the trea&s;ures of the art were open to them; as enamellers,
they improved too by frequenting the be&s;t chymi&s;ts of that country;
but it was in England that they were &s;o fortunate as to learn the
choice&s;t &s;ecrets in the branch to which they had devoted them&s;elves.
Sir Theodore Mayern, fir&s;t phy&s;ician to Charles, and a great chymi&s;t,
communicated to them the proce&s;s of the principal colours which
ought to be employed in enamel, and which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the famous vi|trifications
of Venice and Limoges.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="177">
Mayern introduced Petitot to the King, who knighted and gave
him an apartment in Whitehall. The French author of the Abreg&egrave;
de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres, whom I copy, and am &s;orry to
criticize while I am indebted to him, &s;ays, that Vandyck &s;eeing &s;ome
de&s;igns of Petitot at the King's gold&s;mith's, and informing him&s;elf of
the author, advi&s;ed him to quit the profe&s;&s;ion of jeweller, and apply
him&s;elf to painting portraits in enamel. But the biographer had told
us that that &s;tep was already taken; and &s;urely had not been aban|doned
during a long &s;tay in Italy. What the &s;ame writer adds, that
Vandyck gave him in&s;tructions, when Petitot copied the works of
that ma&s;ter, and that his copies from Vandyck are his be&s;t performan|ces,
is much more agreeable to probability and fact. The magnifi|cent
whole length of Rachel de Rouvigny Counte&s;s of Southampton,
in the collection of the Duke of Devon&s;hire, is painted from the origi|nal
in oil by Vandyck, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Hardwicke, and is
indubitably the mo&s;t capital work in enamel in the world; it is nine
inches three quarters high, by five inches and three quarters wide; and
though the enamel is not perfect in &s;ome trifling parts, the execution
is the bolde&s;t and the colouring the mo&s;t rich and beautifull that can
be imagined. It is dated 1642. His Grace has a head of the Duke
of Buckingham by the &s;ame hand; with the painter's name and the
date 1640; con&s;equently a copy performed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is evidently copied from the Duke's portrait in his family-piece by Hon|thor&s;t at Ken&s;ington.</NOTE> after the Duke's death.
In the &s;ame collection is a portrait of a middle-aged man in armour, in|clo&s;ed
in a ca&s;e of tortoi&s;hel, the per&s;on unknown, but inferior to none
I have &s;een of this ma&s;ter. The Duche&s;s of Portland has another of
the Duke of Buckingham, exactly the &s;ame as the preceding; Charles
<PB N="152" REF="178">
fir&s;t and his Queen, and the Lady Morton, governe&s;s of the royal
children, who is celebrated by Waller. I have a fine head of Charles
1&s;t. in armour, for which he probably &s;at, as it is not like any I have
&s;een by Vandyck; James 2d. when Duke of York, freely painted,
though highly fini&s;hed, and I &s;uppo&s;e done in France; a very large
and capital one of his &s;i&s;ter Henrietta Duche&s;s of Orleans, exqui&s;itely
laboured; a very &s;mall, but fine head of Anne of Au&s;tria; another of
Madame de Monte&s;pan; and a few more of le&s;s note, but all of them
touched in that minute and delicate &s;tyle, into which he afterwards
fell in France, and which, though more laboured, has le&s;s merit in
richne&s;s of tints, than his Engli&s;h works. Vanderdort mentions a
carving by Petitot from Titian's Lucretia, in which way I find no
other account of his attempts, though, as his father was a &s;culptor, he
probably had given his &s;on &s;ome in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The tragic death of his royal protector was a dreadful &s;troke, &s;ays
his biographer, to Petitot, who attended the exiled family to Paris. I
que&s;tion, as &s;o few Engli&s;h portraits appear by his hand, and none
that I know later than 1642, whether the Civil War did not early
drive him back to France; but Bordier undoubtedly remained here
&s;ometime longer, having been employed by the parliament to paint a
memorial of the battle of Na&s;eby, which they pre&s;ented to Fairfax
their victorious general. This &s;ingular curio&s;ity is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
purcha&s;ed from the Mu&s;eum of Thore&s;by, who <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the receipt of the executors of Fairfax to Thore&s;by, who paid 185<HI>l.</HI> for his purcha&s;es. He has, at the end of his Ducatus Leodien&s;is, in the account of his own Mu&s;eum, given a more minute de&s;cription of the&s;e enamels.</NOTE> bought it, with
other rarities, from the executors of Fairfax. It con&s;i&s;ts of two round
plates each but an inch and half diameter, and originally &s;erved, I
<PB N="153" REF="179">
&s;uppo&s;e, for the top and bottom of a watch, &s;uch enamelled plates
being frequent to old watches in&s;tead of cry&s;tals. On the out&s;ide of
that which I take for the bottom, is a repre&s;entation of the Hou&s;e of
Commons, as exhibited on their &s;eals by Simon. Nothing can be
more perfect than the&s;e diminutive figures; of many even the counte|nances
are di&s;tingui&s;hable. On the other piece, within, is delineated
the battle of Na&s;eby; on the out&s;ide is Fairfax him&s;elf on his che&s;tnut
hor&s;e, men engaging at a di&s;tance. The figure and hor&s;e are copied
from Vandyck, but with a freedom, and richne&s;s of colouring, per|haps
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing that great ma&s;ter. Under the hor&s;e, one reads P. B.
fecit. This is the &s;ingle work which can with certainty be allotted to
Bordier alone, and which demon&s;trates how unju&s;tly his fame has been
ab&s;orbed in the renown of his brother-in-law. Charles 2d. during
his abode in that kingdom took great notice of Petitot; and introdu|ced
him to Louis, who, when the re&s;toration happened, retained Pe|titot
in his own &s;ervice, gave him a pen&s;ion and lodged him in the
Louvre. Small portraits of that monarch by this great enameller, are
extremely common, and of the two Queens, his mother and wife.</P>
<P>In 1651 he married Margaret Cuper; the celebrated Drelincourt
performed the ceremony at Charenton; for Petitot was a zealous pro|te&s;tant,
and dreading the con&s;equences of the revocation of the edict
of Nantes in 1685, he begged permi&s;&s;ion of the King to retire to Ge|neva.
Louis, who did not care to part with &s;o favorite a painter,
and who perhaps thought that an enameller's religion was not compo|&s;ed
of &s;terner &s;tuff, than the great Turenne's, eluded his demand; and
at la&s;t being pre&s;&s;ed with repeated memorials, &s;ent Petitot to Fort-l'eveque,
and Bo&s;&s;uet to convert him. The &s;ubtle apo&s;tle, who had
woven &s;uch a texure of devotion and ambition, that the latter was
<PB N="154" REF="180">
&s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable from the former, had the mortification of not
&s;ucceeding, and Petitot's chagrin bringing on a fever, he at la&s;t ob|tained
his liberty, now almo&s;t arrived at the age of four&s;core, which
makes it probable that his conver&s;ion rather than his pencil had been
the foundation of detaining him. He no &s;ooner was free, than he
e&s;caped with his wife to Geneva in 1685. His children, who dreaded
the King's wrath, remained at Paris, and throwing them&s;elves at his
feet, implored his protection. His Maje&s;ty, &s;ays my author, receiv|ed
them with great goodne&s;s, and told them, he willingly forgave an
old man, who had a whim of being buried with his fathers.&mdash;I do not
doubt but this is given, and pa&s;&s;ed at the time, for a bonmot&mdash;but a
very flat wittici&s;m cannot depreciate the glory of a confe&s;&s;or, who has
&s;uffered impri&s;onment, re&s;i&s;ted eloquence, and &s;acrificed the emolu|ments
of court-favour to the uprightne&s;s of his con&s;cience. Petitot
did not wi&s;h to be buried with his fathers, but to die in their religion.</P>
<P>Returned to his country, the good old man continued his darling
profe&s;&s;ion. The King and Queen of Poland de&s;ired to be painted by
his hand, and &s;ent their portraits to be copied by him in enamel, but
the me&s;&s;enger finding him departed, proceeded to Geneva, where he
executed them with all the vigour of his early pencil. The Queen
was repre&s;ented &s;itting on a trophy, and holding the picture of the
King. For this piece he received an hundred Louis d'or's.</P>
<P>So great was the concour&s;e to vi&s;it him, that he was obliged to
quit Geneva and retire to Veray, a little town in the canton of Berne,
where as he was painting his wife, an illne&s;s &s;eized and carried him off
in a day, in 1691, at the age of four&s;core and four. He had had &s;e|venteen
children; one of his daughters, a widow, was living in 1752.
My portrait of Charles 1&s;t. came from one of his &s;ons, who was a ma|jor
<PB N="155" REF="181">
in our &s;ervice. Of the re&s;t, one only attached him&s;elf to his father's
art and practiced in London, his father often &s;ending him his works
for models. This &s;on painted in miniature too, and left de&s;cendents,
who are &s;ettled at Dublin.</P>
<P>It is idle to write a panegyric on the greate&s;t man in any vocation.
That rank di&s;pen&s;es with encomiums, as they are never wanted but
where they may be conte&s;ted. Petitot generally u&s;ed plates of gold
or &s;ilver, &s;eldom copper. In the dawn of his reputation he received
twenty guineas for a picture, which price he afterwards rai&s;ed to forty.
His cu&s;tom was to have a painter to draw the likene&s;s in oil, from
which he made his &s;ketches, and then fini&s;hed them from the life.
Tho&s;e of Louis he copied from the be&s;t pictures of him, but generally
obtained one or two &s;ittings for the completion. His biographer
&s;ays, that he often added <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;pecifies one at Paris of Michel L'a&s;ne, the engraver, a large oval with hands, of which one re&s;ts on his brea&s;t.</NOTE> hands to his portraits; I have &s;een but one
&s;uch, the whole length of Lady Southampton; and that at Loretto
there is of his work an incomparable picture of the Virgin. A collec|tor
at Paris po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more than thirty of this great ma&s;ter's perfor|mances,
particularly the portraits of Me&s;dames de la Valiere, Mon|te&s;pan,
Fontanges &amp;c. Another has tho&s;e of the famous Counte&s;s
d'Olonne, the Duche&s;s of Bouillon, and other ladies of the court. Van
Gun&s;t engraved after Petitot the portrait of Chevreau.</P>
<P>Of Bordier, we have no fuller account than this incidental mention
of him; yet I have &s;hown that his is no trifling claim to a principal
place among tho&s;e arti&s;ts who&s;e works we have mo&s;t rea&s;on to boa&s;t.
I wi&s;h this clue may lead to farther di&s;coveries concerning him!</P>

I come now to other arti&s;ts in the reign of Charles; and fir&s;t of

<P>ANDREW KEARNE</P>

worked. Kearne too carved many &s;tatues for Sir Ju&s;tinian I&s;ham, at

but the greater part of his works con&s;i&s;ting of altar-pieces and cielings
of churches were de&s;troyed in the fire of London. One of his cielings
was in the church of Covent-garden. For &s;ome time he worked
under Vandyck, and &s;everal of his performances are at the Duke of
Rutland's at Belvoir. A book of freeze-work in eight leaves, etched
in 1640, was I &s;uppo&s;e by the hand of the father; as to him mu&s;t be
referred an entry in an office-book, where he is mentioned for paint|ing
and gilding frames of pictures at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e at two &s;hillings
the foot, Feb. 17, 1636. He al&s;o agrees to paint and gild the chimney
piece in the cro&s;s-gallery there for eight pounds. Dob&s;on drew his pic|ture.
He died a few years after the re&s;toration and was buried at
Stamford. He had three &s;ons, who all, &s;ays Graham, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Engli&s;h School.</NOTE> became famous
in their different ways. One was John Pierce, a painter; of the third,
I find no account of his profe&s;&s;ion; the other was Edward the &s;tatuary
and architect. He made the &s;tatues of Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, of Ed|ward
III. at the Royal-exchange, and of Sir William Walworth at Fi&s;h|monger's-hall;
a marble bu&s;t of Thomas Evans, ma&s;ter of, and a
great benefactor to, the company of painters in 1687: The bu&s;t is in
their hall: a model of the head of Milton, which Vertue had, the
bu&s;t of Sir Chri&s;topher Wren in the picture-gallery at Oxford, and a
bu&s;t of Cromwell &s;old at an auction in 1714. He much a&s;&s;i&s;ted Sir
Chri&s;topher in many of his de&s;igns, and built the church of St. Cle|ment
under his direction. Edward Pierce too carved the four dragons
<PB N="158" REF="185">
on the monument, at fifty pounds each. The whole co&s;t of that co|lumn,
exclu&s;ive of the dragons, and of the ba&s;relief which is not men|tioned
in the account, appears by the &s;urvey of Hooke, Leybourn
and others, to have amounted to 8000<HI>l.</HI> A rich va&s;e at Hampton-court
is another of the works of Pierce. He lived and died at his
hou&s;e the corner of Surrey-&s;treet in the Strand, and was buried at St.

was made with the Earl-mar&s;hal, Sir Francis Windebank, and Sir

another architect, was</P>
<P>INIGO JONES,</P>
<P>who, if a table of fame like that in the Tatler, were to be formed for
men of real and indi&s;putable genius in every country, would &s;ave Eng|land
from the di&s;grace of not having her repre&s;entative among the arts.
She adopted Holbein and Vandyck, &s;he borrowed Rubens, &s;he produ|ced
Inigo Jones. Vitruvius drew up his Grammar, Palladio &s;howed
him the practice, Rome di&s;played a theatre worthy of his emulation,
and King Charles was ready to encourage, employ, and reward his
talents. This is the hi&s;tory of Inigo Jones as a genius. The particu|lars
of his life have been often written, and therefore I &s;hall run them
over very briefly; adding &s;ome le&s;s known minutiae [which, I fear,
are the characteri&s;tics of the&s;e volumes] and &s;ome catalogue of his
works.</P>
<P>He was born about 1572, the &s;on of a cloth-worker, and by the
mo&s;t probable accounts, bound apprentice to a joiner, but even in that
ob&s;cure &s;ituation, the brightne&s;s of his capacity bur&s;t forth &s;o &s;trongly,
that he was taken notice of by one of the great Lords at court; &s;ome
&s;ay, it was the Earl of Arundel; the greater <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among whom is Loyd in his Memoires, p. 577.</NOTE> number that it was Wil|liam
Earl of Pembroke; though again&s;t that opinion there is, at lea&s;t,
a negative evidence, which I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently. By one of the&s;e
Lords, Inigo was &s;ent to Italy to &s;tudy land&s;cape-painting, to which
his inclination then pointed, and for which that he had a talent, ap|pears

but the trees freely and ma&s;terly imagined. He was no
&s;ooner at Rome, than he found him&s;elf in his &s;phere. He felt that
nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets, but de&s;ign palaces.
He dropped the pencil, and conceived Whitehall. In the &s;tate of
Venice he &s;aw the works of Palladio, and learned how beautifully ta&s;te
may be exerted on a le&s;s theatre than the capital of an empire. How
his abilities di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a &s;pot where they certainly had
no opportunity to act, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though no building at Venice is attributed to Inigo, the palace and a front of a church at Leghorn are &s;aid to be de&s;igned by him.</NOTE> we are not told, though it would not be the
lea&s;t curious part of his hi&s;tory; certain it is, that on the &s;trength of
his reputation at Venice, Chri&s;tian IV. invited him to Denmark and
appointed him his architect; but on what buildings he was employed
in that country we are yet to learn. James I. found him at Copen|hagen,
and Queen Anne took him in the quality of her architect to
Scotland. He &s;erved Prince Henry in the &s;ame capacity, and the
place of &s;urveyor-general of the works was granted to him in rever&s;ion.
On the death of that Prince, with whom at lea&s;t all his lamented qua|lities
did not die, Jones travelled once more to Italy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
ripene&s;s of judgment perfected his ta&s;te. To the interval between
tho&s;e voyages I &s;hould be inclined to a&s;&s;ign tho&s;e buildings of Inigo,
which are le&s;s pure, and border too much upon that ba&s;tard &s;tyle,
which one calls <HI>King James's Gothic.</HI> Inigo's de&s;igns of that period are
not Gothic, but have a littlene&s;s of parts and a weight of ornaments,
with which the revival of the Grecian ta&s;te was encumbered, and
which he &s;hook of in his grander de&s;igns. The &s;urveyor's place fell
and he returned to England, and as if architecture was not all he had
<PB N="168" REF="197">
learned at Rome, with an air of Roman di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s he gave up
the profits of his office, which he found extremely in debt, and pre|vailed
on the comptroller and payma&s;ter to imitate his example, 'till
the whole arrears were cleared.</P>
<P>In the reign of James I find a payment by a warrant from the coun|cil
to Inigo Jones, Thomas Baldwin, William Portington and George
Weale, officers of his maje&s;ty's works, for certain &s;caffolds and other
works by them made, by the command of the Lord Chamberlain,

<P>In 1620 he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius.
King James &s;et him upon di&s;covering, that is, gue&s;&s;ing, who were the
founders of Stone-henge. His ideas were all romanized; con&s;equently
his partiality to his favorite people, which ought rather to have pre|vented
him from charging them with that ma&s;s of barbarous clum&s;i|ne&s;s,
made him conclude it a Roman Temple. It is remarkable that
whoever has treated of that monument, has be&s;towed it on whatever
cla&s;s of antiquity he was peculiarly fond of; and there is not a heap of
&s;tones in the&s;e Northern countries, from which nothing can be proved,
but has been made to depo&s;e in favour of &s;ome of the&s;e fanta&s;tic hy|pothe&s;es.

1633, when Laud, then Bi&s;hop of London, laid the fir&s;t &s;tone and
Inigo the fourth. In the re&s;toration of that cathedral he made two capi|tal
faults. He fir&s;t renewed the &s;ides with very bad Gothic, and then
added a Roman portico, magnificent and beautifull indeed, but which
had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained, and made his own
Gothic appear ten times heavier. He committed the &s;ame error at
Winche&s;ter, thru&s;ting a &s;creen in the Roman or Grecian ta&s;te into the
middle of that cathedral. Jones indeed was by no means &s;ucce&s;sfull
when he attempted Gothic. The chapel of Lincoln's-inn has none of
the characteri&s;tics of that architecture. The cloy&s;ter beneath &s;eems
oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of the building above. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Dugdale's Origines Judiciales, p. 34, is an account of the building of that chapel from a de&s;ign of Inigo. The fir&s;t propo&s;al of building it was in 1609, but it was retarded 'till about 1617. The charge was e&s;timated at two thou&s;and pounds. It was fini&s;hed in five years, and con&s;ecrated on A&s;cen&s;ion-day 1623 by the Bi&s;hop of London, Dr. Donne preaching the &s;ermon.</NOTE></P>
<P>The authors of the life of Jones place the erection of the banquet|ting-hou&s;e
in the reign of King Charles; but, as I have &s;hown from
the accounts of Nicholas Stone, it was begun in 1619, and fini&s;hed in
two years&mdash;a &s;mall part of the pile, de&s;igned for the palace of our
Kings; but &s;o compleat in it&s;elf, that it &s;tands a model of the mo&s;t
pure and beautifull ta&s;te. Several plates of the intended palace of
<PB N="170" REF="199">
Whitehall have been given, but, I believe, from no fini&s;hed de&s;ign.
The four great &s;heets are evidently made up from general hints, nor
could &s;uch a &s;ource of invention and ta&s;te, as the mind of Inigo, ever
produce &s;o much &s;amene&s;s. The &s;trange kind of cherubims on the
towers at the end are propo&s;terous ornaments, and whether of Inigo or
not, bear no relation to the re&s;t. The great towers in the front are
too near, and evidently borrowed from what he had &s;een in Gothic,
not in Roman buildings. The circular court is a picture&s;que thought,
but without meaning or utility. The whole fabric however was &s;o
glorious an idea, that one forgets for a moment, in the regret for it's
not being executed, the confirmation of our liberties obtained by a me|lancholy
&s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed before the windows of that very banquet|ting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1623 he was employed at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, where a chapel was to
be fitted up for the Infanta, the intended bride of the Prince. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir H. Bourgchier in a letter to archbi&s;hop U&s;her, dated July 14, 1623, &s;ays, "The new chapel for the In&s;anta goes on in building." There was another chapel erected for her at St. James's, of which Don Carlos Colonna laid the fir&s;t &s;tone. V. Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> The
chapel is &s;till in being. The front to the river, part only of what was
de&s;igned, and the water-gate, were erected afterwards on the de&s;igns
of Inigo; as was the gate at York-&s;tairs.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Charles he was continued in his po&s;ts under
both King and Queen. His fee as &s;urveyor was eight &s;hillings and
four-pence per day, with an allowance of forty-&s;ix pounds a year for
hou&s;e-rent, be&s;ides a clerk, and incidental expences. What greater re|wards
he had are not upon record. Con&s;idering the havoc made in
offices and repo&s;itories during the war, one is glad of being able to re|cover
the &s;malle&s;t notices.</P>

During the pro&s;perous &s;tate of the King's affairs, the plea&s;ures of the
court were carried on with much ta&s;te and magnificence. Poetry,
painting, mu&s;ic, and architecture, were all called in to make them ra|tional
amu&s;ements; and I have no doubt but the celebrated fe&s;tivals
of Louis XIV. were copied from the &s;hows exhibited at Whitehall, in
it's time the mo&s;t polite court in Europe. Ben John&s;on was the lau|reat;
Inigo Jones, the inventor of the decorations; Laniere and Fera|bo&s;co
compo&s;ed the &s;imphonies; the King, the Queen, and the young
nobility danced in the interludes. We have accounts of many of the&s;e
entertainments, called ma&s;ques: They had been introduced by Anne
of Denmark. I &s;hall mention tho&s;e in which Jones was concerned.</P>

Queen's wake. Several of the Lords and Ladies acted in it. Daniel
owns that the machinery, and contrivance and ornaments of the &s;cenes
made the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the entertainment.</P>
<P>February 16, 1613, a ma&s;que at Whitehall on the nuptials of the
Pal&s;grave and the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, invented and fa&s;hioned by our

and written by the ingenious poet, George Chapman. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chapman was an intimate friend of Jones, and in 1616 dedicated his tran&s;la|tion of Mu&s;aeus "To the mo&s;t generally ingenious and learned architect of his time, Inigo Jones, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;urveyor of his maje&s;ty's works."

Inigo's own hand, con&s;i&s;ting of habits, ma&s;ks, &s;cenes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The harmony of the&s;e triumphs was a little interrupted by a war
that broke out between the compo&s;ers, Inigo and Ben; in which who|ever
was the aggre&s;&s;or, the turbulent temper of John&s;on took care to
be mo&s;t in the wrong. Nothing exceeds the gro&s;sne&s;s of the language
that he poured out, except the badne&s;s of the ver&s;es that were the ve|hicle.
There he fully exerted all that brutal abu&s;e which his cotem|poraries
were willing to think wit, becau&s;e they were afraid of it; and
which only &s;erves to &s;hew the arrogance of the man, who pre&s;umed to
&s;atirize Jones and rival Shake&s;peare. With the latter indeed he had
not the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to be compared, except in having &s;ome|times
writ ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e. John&s;on tran&s;lated the ancients, Shake|&s;peare
transfu&s;ed their very &s;oul into his writings.</P>
<P>Another per&s;on who &s;eems to have born much re&s;entment to Jones
was Philip Earl of Pembroke; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R. Symondes calls him, the bawling coward.</NOTE> in the Harleian library was an edition
of Stone-henge which formerly belonged to that Earl, and the margins
of which were full of &s;trange notes writ by him, not on the work, but
on the author or any thing el&s;e. I have &s;uch another common-place
book, if one may call it &s;o, of Earl Philip, the life of Sir Thomas
More. In the Stonehenge are memorandums, jokes, wittici&s;ms and
<PB N="174" REF="203">
abu&s;e on &s;everal per&s;ons, particularly on Cromwell and his daughters,
and on Inigo, whom his Lord&s;hip calls, Iniquity Jones; and &s;ays, he
had 16000<HI>l.</HI> a year for keeping the King's hou&s;es in repair. This
might be exaggerated, but a little &s;upplies the want I have mentioned
of any record of the rewards be&s;towed on &s;o great a man. It is ob|&s;ervable
that the Earl who does not &s;pare reflections on his architect,
never objects to him his having been maintained in Italy by Earl Wil|liam;
nor does Webb in his preface to the Stone-henge, though he
&s;peaks of Inigo's being in Italy, &s;ay a word of any patron that &s;ent him
thither. Earl Philip's re&s;entment to Jones was probably occa&s;ioned
by &s;ome di&s;agreement while the latter was employed at Wilton. There
he built that noble front, and a grotto at the end of the water. Wil|ton
is one of the principal objects in a hi&s;tory of the arts, and Belles
Lettres. Sir Philip Sidney wrote his Arcadia there for his &s;i&s;ter;
Vandyck drew many of the race, Holbein and Inigo Jones imagined
the buildings, Earl Thomas compleated the collection of pictures and
a&s;&s;embled that throng of &s;tatues, and the la&s;t Earl Henry has &s;hown
by a bridge de&s;igned by him&s;elf, that had Jones never lived, Wilton
might yet have been a villa worthy of ancient Rome.</P>
<P>The works of Inigo are not &s;carce, though &s;ome that bear his name
were productions of his &s;cholars: &s;ome indeed neither of the one nor
the other. Albins in E&s;&s;ex, I &s;hould attribute to the la&s;t cla&s;s, though
always a&s;cribed to Inigo. If he had any hand in it, it mu&s;t have been
during his fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ion, and before he had &s;een any good buildings.
The hou&s;e is hand&s;ome, has large rooms and rich cielings, but all en|tirely
of the King James's Gothic. Pi&s;hiobury in Hertford&s;hire is &s;aid
to have been built by him for Sir Walter Mildmay. At Woburn is
a grotto-chamber, and &s;ome other &s;mall parts by him, as there is of
<PB N="175" REF="204">
his hand at Thorney-abbey, and a &s;ummer-hou&s;e at Lord Barrington's
in Berk&s;hire. The middle part of each end of the quadrangle at St.
John's Oxford is a&s;cribed to him. The &s;upporters of the royal arms
are &s;trangly crouded in over the niches; but I have &s;een in&s;tances of his
over-doing ornament. Charlton-hou&s;e in Kent is another of his &s;up|po&s;ed
works; but &s;ome critics have thought that only the great gate at
the entrance and the colonades may be of his hand. The cabinet at
Whitehall for the King's pictures was built by him, but we have no
drawing of it. At St. James's he de&s;igned the Queen's chapel. Surge|on's-hall
is one of his be&s;t works; and of the mo&s;t admired, the
arcade of Covent-garden and the church; two &s;tructures, of which I
want ta&s;te to &s;ee the beauties: In the arcade there is nothing remark|able;
the pila&s;ters, are as errant and homely &s;tripes as any plai&s;terer
would make. The barn-roof over the portico of the church &s;trikes my
eyes with as little idea of dignity or beauty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;tice to Inigo one mu&s;t own, that the defect is not in the architect but in the order&mdash;who ever &s;aw a beautifull Tu&s;can building? would the Romans have cho&s;en that order for a temple? Mr. On&s;low, the late &s;peaker, told me an anecdote that corroborates my opinion of this building. When the Earl of Bed|&s;ord &s;ent for Inigo, he told him he wanted a chapel for the pari&s;hioners of Co|vent-garden, but added, he wou'd not go to any con&s;iderable expence; in &s;hort, &s;aid he, I wou'd not have it much better than a barn&mdash;well! then, replied Jones, you &s;hall have the hand&s;ome&s;t barn in England.</NOTE> as it could do if it covered
nothing but a barn. The expence of building that church was 4500<HI>l.</HI>
Ambre&s;bury in Wilt&s;hire was de&s;igned by him, but executed by his
&s;cholar Webb, who married a cou&s;in-german of Jones. Chevening is
another hou&s;e a&s;cribed to him, but doubtfull; Gunner&s;bury near Brent|ford
was certainly his; the portico is too large, and engro&s;&s;es the whole
<PB N="176" REF="205">
front except a &s;ingle window at each end. The &s;tair-ca&s;e and &s;alon are
noble, but de&s;troy the re&s;t of the hou&s;e; the other chambers are &s;mall,
and crouded by va&s;t chimney-pieces, placed with an Italian negligence
in any corner of the room. Lind&s;ey-hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones was one of the fir&s;t that ob&s;erved the &s;ame gradual diminution of pi|la&s;ters as in pillars. Lind&s;ey-hou&s;e owes it's chief grace to this &s;ingularity.</NOTE> in Lincoln's-inn-fields
has a cha&s;ter front, but is not better di&s;po&s;ed for the apartments. In
1618 a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued to the Lord Chancellor, the Earls
of Worce&s;ter, Pembroke, Arundel, and others, to plant, and reduce to
uniformity Lincoln's inn-fields, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That &s;quare is laid out with a regard to &s;o trifling a circum&s;tance, as to be of the exact dimen&s;ions of one of the pyramids. This would have been admired in tho&s;e ages, when the keep at Kenelworth-ca&s;tle was erected in the form of a hor&s;e-fetter, and the E&s;curial in the &s;hape of St. Laurence's gridiron.</NOTE> as it &s;hall be drawn by way of map
or ground-plot, by Inigo Jones, &s;urveyor general of the works. Cole|&s;hill,
in Berk&s;hire, the &s;eat of Sir Matthew Pleydell, built in 1650,
and Cobham-hall in Kent, were his; He was employed to rebuild
Ca&s;tle-A&s;hby, and fini&s;hed one front, but the civil war interrupted his
progre&s;s, there and at Stoke-park in Northampton&s;hire. Shaft&s;bury-hou&s;e,
now the London-lying-in ho&s;pital, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Alder&s;|gate-&s;treet,
is a beautifull front; at Wing, &s;even miles from his pre&s;ent
&s;eat at Ethorp, in Buckingham&s;hire, Sir William Stanhope pulled
down a hou&s;e built by Inigo. The front to the garden of Hinton St.
George in Somer&s;et&s;hire, the &s;eat of Earl Poulet; and the front of
Brympton, formerly the man&s;ion of Sir Philip Sydenham, were from
de&s;igns of Jones; as Chilham-ca&s;tle, and the tower of the church at
Staines, where Inigo &s;ometime lived, are &s;aid to be. So is a very cu|rious
work, if really by him, as I know no other performance of his in
that kind, a bridge at Gwydder in Wales, on the e&s;tate of the Duke of
<PB N="177" REF="206">
Anca&s;ter. Some alterations and additions he made at Sion. At
Oatlands remains a gate of the old palace, but removed to a little di&s;|tance,
and repaired, with the addition of an in&s;cription, by the pre&s;ent
Earl of Lincoln. The Grange, the &s;eat of the Lord Chancellor
Henley in Hamp&s;hire, is entirely of this ma&s;ter. It is not a large
hou&s;e, but by far one of the be&s;t proofs of his ta&s;te. The hall which
opens to a &s;mall ve&s;tibule with a cupola, and the &s;tairca&s;e adjoining,
are beautifull models of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t cla&s;&s;ic antiquity. The
gate of Beaufort-garden at Chel&s;ea, de&s;igned by Jones, was purcha&s;ed
by Lord Burlington and tran&s;ported to Chi&s;wick, where in a temple
are &s;ome wooden &s;eats with lions and other animals for arms, not of
his mo&s;t delicate imagination, brought from Tart-hall. He drew a
plan for a palace at Newmarket, but not that wretched hovel that
&s;tands there at pre&s;ent. The la&s;t, and one of the mo&s;t beautifull of
his works, that I &s;hall mention, is the Queen's hou&s;e at Greenwich.
The fir&s;t idea of the ho&s;pital is &s;aid to have been taken by Webb from
his papers. The re&s;t of his de&s;igns, and his &s;maller works, as chim|nies
and cielings, &amp;c. may be &s;een in the editions of Kent, Ware, Var|dy,
and Campbell.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke of Oxford had Jones's Palladio with his own notes and
ob&s;ervations in Italian, which the doctor bequeathed to Worce&s;ter col|lege.
The Duke of Devon&s;hire has another with the notes in Latin.
Lord Burlington had a Vitruvius noted by him in the &s;ame manner.
The &s;ame Lord had his head by Dob&s;on. At Houghton, it is by
Vandyck. Hollar engraved one of them. Villamena made a print of
him while he was in Italy. Among the Stra&s;&s;ord papers there is a
letter from Lord Cottington to the Lord deputy &s;ending him a memo|rial
from Inigo, relating to the procurement of marble from Ireland.</P>

Inigo ta&s;ted early of the misfortunes of his ma&s;ter: He was not
only a favorite <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vanderdort's catalogue is mention of a picture of Stenwyck bought by Inigo for the King, p. 15, and of a waxen picture of Henry VIII. and a drawing of Prince Henry pre&s;ented by him, p. 75.</NOTE> but a Roman catholic. In 1646 he paid 545<HI>l.</HI> for
his delinquency and &s;eque&s;tration. Whether it was before or after
this fine I know not, that he and Stone buried their joint &s;tock of ready
money in Scotland-yard; but an order being publi&s;hed to encourage
the informers of &s;uch concealments, and four per&s;ons being privy to
the &s;pot where the money was hid, it was taken up and reburied in
Lambeth-mar&s;h.</P>
<P>Grief, misfortunes. and age, terminated his life. He died at Somer|&s;et-hou&s;e
July 21, 1651, and on the 26th of the &s;ame month was bu|ried
in the church of St. Bennet's Paul's-wharf, where a monument <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> on the frame of his picture, when bought by Sir Robert Walpole, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> ermine and ermine, a lion rampant, or, within a border <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;ame.</NOTE>

a Latin epigram. This head by Walker is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord

many directions in painting that had been communicated to him by

ten pounds for the portrait of Mr. Thomas Knight's wife to the
knees; that &s;he &s;at thrice to him, four or five hours at a time. That
for two half lengths of philo&s;ophers, which he drew from poor old
men, he had ten pounds each in 1652; that he paid twenty five
pounds for the Venus putting on her &s;mock (by Titian) which was the
King's, and valued it at &s;ixty-pounds, as he was told by Mrs. Board|man,
