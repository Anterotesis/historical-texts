<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SOME Ver&s;es, it may be ob&s;erv'd,
in the following Collection, were
wrote upon the Scheme of the My&s;tick
Divines. And the&s;e, 'tis own'd, we haa
once in great Veneration, as the be&s;t
Explainers of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST.
But we are now convinced that we
therein <HI>greatly err'd: not knowing the
Scriptures, neither the Power of</HI> GOD.
And becau&s;e this is an Error which many
&s;erious Minds are &s;ooner or later expo&s;ed
to, and which indeed mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets
tho&s;e, who &s;eek the LORD JESUS
in Sincerity; we believe our&s;elves indi&s;|pen&s;ably
obliged, in the Pre&s;ence of GOD
and Angels, and Men, to declare wherein
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
we apprehend tho&s;e Writers, Not to
teach <HI>the Truth as it is in JESUS.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. And fir&s;t, we apprehend them to lay
Another Foundation. They are carefull
indeed to pull down our own Works, and
to prove, that <HI>by the DEEDS of the Law
&s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified.</HI> But why
is this? Only, <HI>to e&s;tabli&s;h our own
Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in the place of our own
Works. They &s;peak largely and well, a|gain&s;t
expecting to be accepted of GOD
for our Virtuous Actions: And then
teach, That we are to be accepted, For
our Virtuous Habits or Tempers. Still
the Ground of our Acceptance is placed
<HI>in our&s;elves.</HI> The Difference is only this:
Common Writers &s;uppo&s;e we are to be
ju&s;tified, for the Sake of our Outward
Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The&s;e &s;uppo&s;e we are to
be ju&s;tified, for the Sake of our Inward
Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Whereas in truth, we
are no more ju&s;tified, for the &s;ake of
one than of the other. For neither
our own Inward nor Outward Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
is the Ground of our Ju&s;tification.
Holine&s;s of Heart, as well as Holine&s;s of
Life, is not the Cau&s;e, but the Effect of
<PB N="v" REF="4">
it. The Sole Cau&s;e of our Acceptance with
GOD (or, That for the Sake of which
on the Account of which we are accepted)
is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and the Death of
CHRIST, who fulfilled GOD's Law,
and died in our Stead. And even the
Condition of it, is not (as they &s;uppo&s;e)
our Holine&s;s either of Heart of Life: But
our Faith Alone; Faith contradi&s;tingui&s;h'd
from Holine&s;s as well as from Good Works.
Other Foundation therefore can no Man lay,
without being an Adver&s;ary to CHRIST
and his Go&s;pel, than Faith Alone, Faith,
though nece&s;&s;arily producing both, yet not
including either Good Works, or Holi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. But &s;uppo&s;ing them to have laid the
Foundation right, the Manner of building
thereon which they advi&s;e, is quite oppo|&s;ite
to that pre&s;cribed by CHRIST. He
commands to <HI>build up one another.</HI> They
advi&s;e, "To the De&s;ert, to the De&s;ert,
and GOD will build you up." Num|berle&s;s
are the Commendations that occur
in all their Writings, not of Retirement
intermix'd with Conver&s;ation, but of an
intire Seclu&s;ion from Men, (perhaps for
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Months or Years) in order to purify the
Soul. Whereas, according to the Judg|ment
of our Lord, and the Writings of
his Apo&s;tles, it is only when we are <HI>knit
together,</HI> that we <HI>have Nouri&s;hment
from Him, and increa&s;e with the In|crea&s;e
of GOD.</HI> Neither is there any
time, when the weake&s;t Member can &s;ay
to the &s;tronge&s;t, or the &s;tronge&s;t to the
weake&s;t, "<HI>I have no need of Thee.</HI>"
Accordingly our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, when his
Di&s;ciples were in their weake&s;t State,
&s;ent them forth, not alone, but <HI>Two by
Two.</HI> When they were &s;trengthen'd a
little, not by Solitude, but by abiding with
him and one another, he commanded them
to <HI>wait,</HI> not &s;eparate but <HI>being a&s;&s;em|bled
together, for the Promi&s;e of the
Father.</HI> And <HI>they were all with one
Accord in one Place,</HI> when they re|ceived
the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. Ex|pre&s;s
mention is made in the &s;ame Chapter,
that when <HI>there were added unto them
Three Thou&s;and Souls, all that believed
were together, and continued &s;tedfa&s;tly</HI>
not only <HI>in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine</HI> but al&s;o
<HI>in fellow&s;hip and in breaking of Bread</HI>
and in praying <HI>with one Accord.</HI> A|greeable
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
to which is the Account the
Great Apo&s;tle gives, of the Manner which
he had been taught of GOD, <HI>for the
perfecting of the Saints, for the edi|fying
of the Body of CHRIST,</HI> even
to the end of the World. And according
to St. <HI>Paul, all</HI> who will ever <HI>come, in
the Unity of the Faith, unto a per|fect
Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the
Stature of the Fulne&s;s of CHRIST,</HI>
mu&s;t together <HI>grow up into him. From
whom the whole Body fitly join'd to|gether
and compacted</HI> (or &s;trengthen'd)
<HI>by that which every joint &s;upplieth,
according to the effectual Working in
the Mea&s;ure of every part, maketh
Increa&s;e of the Body, unto the Edi|fying
of it&s;elf in Love.</HI> Ephe&s;ians iv.
15, 16.</P>
<P N="4">4. So widely di&s;tant is the Manner of
Building up Souls in CHRIST taught
by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> from that taught by the
My&s;ticks! Nor do they differ as to the
Foundation, or the Manner of Building
thereon, more than they do with Regard
to the Super&s;tructure. For the Religion
the&s;e Authors wou'd edify us in, is Soli|tary
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Religion. If Thou wilt be Per|fect,
&s;ay they, "trouble not thy&s;elf a|bout
Outward Works. It is better to
work Virtues in the Will. He hath
attain'd the True Re&s;ignation, who
hath e&s;tranged him&s;elf from all Out|ward
Works, that GOD may work
inwardly in him, without any turning
to Outward Things. The&s;e are the
true Wor&s;hippers, who wor&s;hip GOD,
in Spirit and in Truth." For Con|templation
is with them, the fulfilling
of the Law, even a Contemplation that
"con&s;i&s;ts in a Ce&s;&s;ation of all Works."</P>
<P N="5">5. Directly oppo&s;ite to this is the Go&s;pel
of CHRIST. Solitary Religion is not
to be found there. "Holy Solitaries" is
a Phra&s;e no more con&s;i&s;tent with the Go|&s;pel
than Holy Adulterers. The Go&s;pel
of CHRIST knows of no Religion, but
Social; no Holine&s;s but Social Holine&s;s.
<HI>Faith working by Love,</HI> is the length
and breadth and depth and height of
Chri&s;tian Perfection. <HI>This Command|ment
have we from CHRIST, that
he who love GOD, love his Brother
al&s;o</HI>: And that we manife&s;t our Love,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
<HI>by doing good unto all Men; e&s;pe|cially
to them that are of the Hou&s;e|hold
of Faith.</HI> And in truth, who|&s;oever
loveth his Brethren not in Word
only, but as CHRIST loved him, can|not
but be <HI>zealous of Good Works.</HI>
He feels in his Soul a burning, re&s;tle&s;s
De&s;ire, of &s;pending and being &s;pent for
them. <HI>My Father,</HI> will he &s;ay, <HI>work|eth
hitherto and I work,</HI> And at all
po&s;&s;ible Opportunities, he is, like his Ma|&s;ter,
<HI>going about doing good.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This then is the Way: Walk Ye in
it, who&s;oever Ye are that have believed in
his Name. Ye know,</HI> Other Foundation
can no Man lay, than that which is laid,
even JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Ye feel that</HI> by
Grace Ye are <HI>&s;aved thro' Faith; &s;aved
from Sin, by CHRIST form'd</HI> in your
Hearts, <HI>and from Fear, by</HI> his Spirit
bearing Witne&s;s with your Spirit, that
Ye are the Sons of GOD. <HI>Ye are taught
of GOD,</HI> not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling
of your&s;elves together, as the Manner
of &s;ome is; <HI>but to in&s;truct, admoni&s;h,
exhort, reprove, comfort, confirm and
every Way</HI> build up one another. Ye
<PB N="x" REF="9">
have an Unction from the Holy One,
<HI>that teacheth you to renounce any other or
higher Perfection, than</HI> Faith working
by Love, <HI>Faith</HI> zealous of Good Works,
<HI>Faith</HI> as it hath opportunity doing good
unto all Men. As Ye have therefore
received JESUS CHRIST the LORD, &s;o
Walk ye in Him: Rooted and built
up in Him, and &s;tabli&s;h'd in the Faith
and abounding therein <HI>more and more.
Only,</HI> beware le&s;t any Man &s;poil you
thro' Philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after
the tradition of Men, after the rudiments
of the World, and not after CHRIST.
<HI>For</HI> Ye are complete in Him. He is
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. <HI>Only</HI>
continue in <HI>Him,</HI> grounded and &s;ettled
and be not moved away from the Hope
of the Go&s;pel: And when CHRIST,
who is our Life, &s;hall appear, then
&s;hall Ye al&s;o appear with him in Glory!</P>
