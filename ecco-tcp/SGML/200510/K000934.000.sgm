</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GENERAL GAGE's Proclamation lies before
me, though it is not a &s;ubject for critici&s;m, yet
it de&s;erves notice; we may overlook the &s;tyle, but
mu&s;t dete&s;t the doctrine; with what judgment the
General may command, with what &s;pirit he
may fight, with what prudence he may retreat, is
yet unknown; but if his conduct in the field is
equal to his compo&s;ition in the clo&s;et, the &s;ucce&s;s
of his maje&s;ty's arms mu&s;t be owing more to fate
than judgment. This murderous proclamation
opens with great &s;olemnity, bold a&s;&s;ertions, and
notorious fal&s;ehoods; it proceeds with the per&s;e|vering
&s;pirit of the times; but, alas! its imperious
offers of clemency, and its conceited menaces,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
are vain alike. The one will make no converts
for want of confidence; and the other can make
no cowards for want of power. To &s;ubjugate
America entirely, by means of our fleet and
&s;tanding army, is impo&s;&s;ible; the thought only
proves that admini&s;tration is as weak as it is wick|ed;
&s;hould they be determined, like their mi&s;|guided
ma&s;ter, to per&s;evere, they will, ere long,
find it impracticable either to go forward, or to
retreat; they will (let them mark the words of an
unknown writer) oblige the people, throughout
the empire of Great Britain, to take the power
again into their own hands; even anarchy is pre|ferable
to de&s;poti&s;m, e&s;pecially while the govern|ment
is in the hands of fools, madmen, knaves,
and tyrants; hard u&s;age ju&s;tifies hard names.&mdash;Let
us now proceed to this alluring proclamation, this
flim&s;y, political trap for antiquated Roman vir|tue.</P>
<P>The General thought fit to arraign the conduct
of the Americans as incendiaries and traitors
again&s;t the con&s;titutional authority of the &s;tate; if
the word incendiary has any meaning in the Eng|li&s;h
language, it can only be applied with propriety
to one who is the fir&s;t kindler of commotions in a
&s;tate; according to our con&s;titution, the very head
that wears the crown may be an incendiary, by
encouraging a faction, which may as well originate
in the court as in the cottage, if the King and his
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Parliament, devoted to a vile admini&s;tration, com|bine
to per&s;evere in carrying any one point again&s;t
the con&s;titution, they are from that moment a fac|tion
(incendiaries) and not a government; they
are traitors, traitors to the people. Let me now
a&s;k, whether faction fir&s;t took ri&s;e in America, or
the mother country? In that &s;pot (wherever it
may be) we mu&s;t look for the&s;e incendiaries and
traitors. I have put the que&s;tion fairly; it is &s;imple,
plain, and determinative.&mdash;I pau&s;e for a reply&mdash;
not from the mouth of a haughty pen&s;ioner, a
Scotch placeman, or a fawning courtier; but by
the deci&s;ion of a true con&s;titutionali&s;t I am willing
to abide. In the interim, I &s;hall declare my own
opinion&mdash;That the mother country, repre&s;ented
as &s;he is by a corrupt majority, fir&s;t formed a fac|tion
her&s;elf again&s;t the laws and liberties of Ame|rica;
nay, &s;he has done more, &s;he has artfully
formed even a religious faction (the wor&s;t of all
others) upon that great continent. Her govern|ment
has of late been admini&s;tered upon &s;uch mi&s;|taken,
narrow, rotten principles, that &s;he did not
think her&s;elf &s;ecure till &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed Popery
by act of Parliament at Quebec, by way of fo|menting
di&s;&s;entions and enmity in tho&s;e dominions
&s;he would en&s;lave, or admini&s;tration knew and
feared the principles of the people upon that con|tinent.
They had read that their ance&s;tors were
Puritans, and no friends to tyranny or popery;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
they knew their de&s;igns, and planted Papi&s;ts in
their rear to keep their rebellious &s;ubjects, as they
call them, between two fires, and to deter them
from taking refuge in the back &s;ettlements; but
they have numbers and virtue &s;ufficient to enable
them to keep, or at lea&s;t to recover their ground.
Thus have a corrupt majority, fal&s;ely called the
Great Council of the Nation, them&s;elves departed,
and encouraged Government to depart, in this as
well as numberle&s;s other in&s;tances, from the line
of right laid down at the Revolution, a period but
little reverenced by our State-pilots, Bute and
Mansfield; the&s;e two men, with their lacqueys in
and out of Parliament, are the real and only incen|diaries
of America. The wretched Americans,
unju&s;tly branded by every hireling with the name
of traitors, are only bu&s;ied, and ju&s;tly bu&s;ied, in
extingui&s;hing tho&s;e flames, which &s;uch a govern|ment
(if it de&s;erves the name of one) has kindled;
whether the Americans are traitors, or unhappy
&s;ubjects making a lawful re&s;i&s;tance to repeated
tyrannies, mu&s;t be determined, not by hirelings,
who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate for pay, but by tho&s;e who pay
them with reluctance, by the collective body of
the people, in whom all power virtually re&s;ides,
from whom it originates, and to whom it mu&s;t
perhaps &s;hortly di&s;&s;olve again. What the General
calls trea&s;on, this collective body (an awful tri|bunal)
will pronounce con&s;titutional re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
The Americans are next accu&s;ed of a fatal pro|gre&s;&s;ion
of crimes again&s;t the con&s;titutional autho|rity
of the &s;tate.&mdash;By the term con&s;titutional, if the
General means an authority con&s;titutionally exer|ci&s;ed,
I deny his a&s;&s;ertion; it is as little founded
on truth, as our mini&s;terial mea&s;ures are upon
&s;ound policy, ju&s;tice and humanity; when the
principles of the con&s;titution are abandoned (as
they have lately been) the &s;tate may proceed au|thoritively,
or rather de&s;potically, but it cannot
be &s;aid to act con&s;titutionally.&mdash;That the Ameri|cans
avow rebellion, I deny likewi&s;e; that they
avow re&s;i&s;tance (as their brave ance&s;tors once did,
and as all true Revolutioni&s;ts will do) every Bri|ton,
as an enemy to &s;lavery, mu&s;t rejoice.</P>
<P>For the patience and lenity of the King's (in
truth of Lord Bute's and Lord Mansfield's) go|vernment,
I appeal to facts. Tho&s;e, who are
ma&s;ters of the di&s;putes between England and Ame|rica,
and &s;tand unbia&s;&s;ed by corruption, will pa&s;s
an impartial judgment between the oppre&s;&s;ors and
oppre&s;&s;ed; we doubt not but the Sovereign's pa|tience
is equal to his other godlike attributes; but
we know that the patience of America has been
&s;everely tried; among other inva&s;ions &s;he has been
&s;tripped of the mo&s;t valuable privilege, the birth|right
of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, trial by juries. In many
other in&s;tances government has attempted to en|&s;lave
them; and &s;hall the aggre&s;&s;ors pre&s;ume to
<PB N="6" REF="8">
boa&s;t thus of their patience and lenity? At what time,
in what particulars, were they exerted? Were the
humble &s;upplications and remon&s;trances of Ame|rica
received by either, and by which of the three
great e&s;tates of this kingdom? If &s;o, a Norton
and Ap&s;ley, or &s;ome mini&s;terial paricide, can in|form
us; but if they were (and they really were)
rejected with contempt by all, what pretence, what
effrontery have the tools and &s;ycophants of power,
to in&s;ult the under&s;tandings of mankind with
&s;ounds? What hopes (for &s;uch the General talks
of) could America ever entertain of &s;uch an Ad|mini&s;tration,
&s;uch a Parliament, and &s;uch a Sove|reign?
She has, alas! been driven to de&s;pair by
all; nay, her &s;upplications have been finally an|&s;wered
by tho&s;e divine effects of patience and
lenity&mdash;Famine and the &s;word. Thus have tho&s;e
who are entru&s;ted (as the General &s;ays) with &s;u|preme
rule, manife&s;ted to all the world, that they
bear not the &s;word in vain. Could George the
Third, that mirror of per&s;everance, that idol of
an abandoned Mini&s;try, pre&s;ent the &s;word of ju&s;|tice,
like the old heathen emperor, to the people,
and bid them u&s;e it for him, or again&s;t him, ac|cording
to his de&s;erts? If he could, he then bears
not the &s;word in vain, but in defiance of heaven
and earth, in defiance of all laws human and
divine; nor can he bear it long.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
But the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of the crown and
people of Great Britain (&s;ays the General) have
been infringed. It is a mo&s;t audacious piece of
military in&s;olence, after the late act of tyranny
a&s;&s;ented to by the &s;teady Sovereign, to join the
names of crown and people together, as if their
views and intere&s;t were &s;till, as in truth they ought
to be, the &s;ame. Blind to its own intere&s;t, to its
honour, to its e&s;tabli&s;hment, to its &s;acred engage|ments
at the altar, has the crown, who&s;e &s;ole aim
is plainly de&s;potic power, con&s;ulted the intere&s;ts of
the people in its di&s;putes with America? The rights
of the crown and people were &s;tipulated anew at
the Revolution. But has the crown kept its com|pact
with the people of America? If not, by whom
have the rights of the people been infringed?&mdash;As
to the rights of the crown, as &s;tipulated at the Re|volution,
they are well known, and have been reli|giou&s;ly
&s;ubmitted to both at home and abroad,
even in rebellious America; but when it begins to
&s;tretch out the arm of u&s;urpation, it is time that
its de&s;potic &s;inews &s;hould be &s;hrunk.</P>
<P>That the Americans have been guilty (and
bravely guilty) of premeditation and con&s;piracy is
mo&s;t true. They have been provoked to action,
and they were too wi&s;e to act without thinking.
They have mo&s;t virtuou&s;ly con&s;pired again&s;t ty|rants,
and di&s;dained to wear the chains of the mo&s;t
pious King, the wi&s;e&s;t Admini&s;tration, and mo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="10">
incorrupt Parliament that Great Britain ever
knew.&mdash;For the&s;e demerits the fulne&s;s of cha&s;ti&s;e|ment
is threatened. But &s;uppo&s;e the cha&s;ti&s;ers
&s;hould be cha&s;ti&s;ed? I have always under&s;tood
that true courage was ever accompanied by the
greate&s;t mode&s;ty. Hi&s;tory is full of the&s;e exam|ples.
But our Mini&s;try (like their Sandwich and
their Denbigh) have idly thought that America may
be &s;ubdued by ga&s;conade. Such corrupt wretches
are &s;trangers to the great effects of virtue. Sad
experience will inform them &s;oon that all human
&s;ouls are not as abject as their own.</P>
<P>The Americans are next accu&s;ed of an unna|tural
revolt. If by this expre&s;&s;ion is meant a revolt
again&s;t their natural allegiance, I an&s;wer, that
when protection is fir&s;t unju&s;tly withdrawn on the
Sovereign's part, all allegiance cea&s;es on the &s;ub|ject's.
The &s;ubject mu&s;t then recur to the rights
of nature; re&s;i&s;tance may en&s;ue, but no revolt;
for the Sovereign, by breaking his compact, has
&s;et the &s;ubject free. A politician would rea&s;on
thus; but a &s;oldier has no idea of any mode of
government but by the &s;word.&mdash;We are then told
that our coloni&s;ts dared not tru&s;t their cau&s;e to the
impartial judgment of the public, or even to the
di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reflection of their followers.&mdash;But
with what truth? Were not the General Congre&s;&s;es
throughout the continent of America &s;o many open
appeals to the judgment of an impartial public?
<PB N="9" REF="11">
Were not the flagitious prints, the popular ha|rangues,
the declamation from the pulpits (which
the General complains of) &s;o many incitements to
the cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reflection of their follow|ers?
Indeed, General, you &s;hould always rea&s;on
&s;word in hand. The pen is not your fort. You
are lo&s;t upon paper, and mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ubmit to be
vanqui&s;hed in the field. Putnam is in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The poor Americans are charged in the next
place with a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of truth; with ob&s;tructing
every appeal to the real intere&s;t of the people;
with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t forgeries, calumnies, and ab&s;ur|dities.
To &s;ay that the Americans have been
guilty of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing truth, forging fal&s;ehoods,
venting calumnies, and impo&s;ing ab&s;urdities upon
their party, is but a kind of petulant recrimination.
The&s;e di&s;honourable proceedings, if true, are but
the common &s;tratagems of war. They are not pe|culiar
to one &s;ide only, for the King's party has
practi&s;ed them; all the in&s;idious &s;pies of Go|vernment
have practi&s;ed them; General Carle|ton
has practi&s;ed them mo&s;t ba&s;ely; you your|&s;elf,
General Gage, have practi&s;ed them as di&s;|honourably;
but after all, is this malicious
&s;plenetic recrimination a proof of trea&s;on and
rebellion again&s;t the&s;e injured people? In &s;pite
of all this foul language, the world will think
that there is as much veracity, virtue, candour,
honour, and true courage on the part of free|men
<PB N="10" REF="12">
who defend, as on the part of tyrants who
invade their liberties. I now wi&s;h to be in|formed
of the&s;e appeals which have been made
(if the General &s;ays true) to the real intere&s;t of
America.</P>
<P>Through what channels have they pa&s;&s;ed? Have
either of the three great e&s;tates of this kingdom,
or has the Mini&s;ter, or even a &s;ingle tool or lac|quey
of Admini&s;tration, has a North, a Sandwich,
or a Denbigh, once conde&s;cended to advi&s;e, ad|moni&s;h,
or expo&s;tulate with America? Has the
Secretary of State for that department ever had
orders to write in &s;uch a &s;train? Have not all
Lord Bute's &s;ervile clan endeavoured, on the con|trary,
to carry every thing with a high hand, and
a menacing audacious front? Have they not &s;hut
their eyes, ears and hearts, again&s;t every humble
approach, every filial interce&s;&s;ion of America?
The&s;e in&s;olent invaders of royal charters, human
rights, and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, have been too much
&s;lu&s;hed with the hopes of conque&s;t, to wi&s;h cor|dially
for a reconciliation with America. They
have indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;topped up every opening to|wards
it. The mouths of our patriots and our
citizens have been &s;topped by corrupt votes and
maje&s;tic in&s;ults; as to the propo&s;al made by Lord
North in his Hou&s;e of Commons, it was calcu|lated
for the contempt it met with. His Lord&s;hip
was not quite fool enough to think it could take
<PB N="11" REF="13">
place. By whom then has any appeal to the real
intere&s;t of America been made by tho&s;e who would
exterminate the people?</P>
<P>The pro&s;titution of the pre&s;s makes the next
item in the General's catalogue of complaints. If
the American pre&s;s has been pro&s;tituted, I pray
that Doctor John&s;on may be called upon to declare,
upon the honour of a court-pen&s;ioner, how glori|ou&s;ly
the Engli&s;h pre&s;s has been employed in the
cau&s;e of truth by his brother Garreteers; even the
eloquence of the laity and clergy has been exerted
(&s;ays the General) to excite and ju&s;tify deva&s;tation
and ma&s;&s;acre. Can a &s;oldier, who &s;hould be a
man of honour, a&s;&s;ert &s;o gro&s;s a fal&s;ehood? It is
notorious that no one popular harangue, as the
General calls them, has been made in America,
with any other view than that of animating their
gallant countrymen to a ju&s;t defence of their liber|ties,
properties, and lives; the noble&s;t purpo&s;e of
which the di&s;tingui&s;hed gift of the &s;peech can &s;erve.
That the brave and virtuous Americans have
animated each other in &s;upport of their national
rights, will be recorded in hi&s;tory to their immor|tal
honour; that our perfidious government has
armed the Papi&s;ts, whom they patronize at Que|bec,
with a view of de&s;troying their Prote&s;tant
&s;ubjects, is a circum&s;tance which will make a
figure of a different ca&s;t in hi&s;tory, and will mo&s;t
a&s;&s;uredly bring the advi&s;ers of that mea&s;ure to an
<PB N="12" REF="14">
ignominious death, in &s;pite of the &s;tanding army
employed and paid at pre&s;ent for no other purpo&s;e
than that of protecting tyrants; whether popular
harangues made in one ca&s;e, or arms &s;upplied in
the other, is mo&s;t characteri&s;tic of national honour
and virtue, may ea&s;ily be determined. And to
this the ba&s;e, the cowardly, the traiterous de&s;ign of
government, after all the parade and military blu&s;|ter,
of &s;urrendering Canada to the French, a va&s;t
province acquired la&s;t war, at the expence of &s;o
much blood and trea&s;ure. This pu&s;illanimous
thought has been &s;ugge&s;ted to gratify a de&s;pairing
tyrant. I now accompany the General to the ac|count
he gives of the 19th of April la&s;t, re&s;pecting
an attack upon the King's troops from behind
walls, and lurking holes. Be it &s;o; yet who can
believe that the King's troops &s;hould have been
unprepared for ambu&s;cade, or any acts of ho&s;tile
frenzy, as the General calls it? Have not the
Americans been driven to this frenzy? Is it not
common for an enemy to take every advantage?
Is it not uncommon, nay impo&s;&s;ible, that troops,
charged with vengeance, &s;hould be unprepared to
take it? They could not be unprepared for taking
it, if they were armed; nor would they decline
taking it, if they were Scotchmen. Their not
taking it, therefore, mu&s;t be owing either to a want
of &s;pirit or want of conduct, or a want of power.
Since that period (of the 19th of April) &s;ays the
<PB N="13" REF="15">
General, the rebels have derived confidence from
impunity.&mdash;Is it a matter of merit then, with a mer|cenary
&s;oldiery, that they did not execute what
they were unable to effect? This is talking like a
driveller, General! But the&s;e rebels, the&s;e traiter|ous
Revolutioni&s;ts in America, have dared to fire
upon the King's &s;hips and &s;ubjects&mdash;Granted&mdash;but
have not the&s;e &s;hips invaded them, have not the&s;e
&s;ubjects (why did you not &s;ay &s;oldiers and marines)
threatened their de&s;truction? Is the doctrine of
pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance to the divine
will of tyrants, to be ob&s;erved by the in&s;ulted and
en&s;laved Americans, till they felt their Sovereign's
bayonet in their bo&s;oms?&mdash;The&s;e rebels have pro|ceeded
even farther; they have affected (&s;ays our
General) to hold the King's army be&s;ieged&mdash;Have
they? May heavens pro&s;per &s;uch a glorious piece
of affectation! Every con&s;titutionali&s;t throughout
the Briti&s;h empire hopes they will not only affect
it, but effect it: every true born Briton longs to
&s;ee the final triumph of America marked as an
epocha in the future annals of his country; nor
would their joy be checked by the appearance of
another ble&s;&s;ed martyrdom in the calendar. Ty|ranny
and martyrdom, like repre&s;entation and tax|ation,
&s;hould go together.</P>
<P>The charge of inva&s;ion upon private property,
and a wantonne&s;s of cruelty, is not only indecent,
but imprudent, from that mouth which commands
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the King's banditti in America, who have &s;o dar|ingly
them&s;elves invaded the liberties, the proper|ties,
the laws and lives of a free people with the
&s;word, merely becau&s;e they claim, and will main|tain,
the rights of Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>As to the actions of the nineteenth of April la&s;t,
which &s;o often haunt the General's mind, they
ought to &s;tand for ever recorded in the calendar,
to the eternal honour of America, who that day
not only totally di&s;appointed, but bravely re&s;i&s;ted
no con&s;iderable party of the King's military a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins.
If any improprieties were committed on that
nineteenth of April by the American troops, which
cannot ea&s;ily be pardoned by &s;o con&s;ummate a &s;ol|dier
as General Gage; yet their gallant behaviour
on the &s;eventeenth of June following mu&s;t &s;urely
have de&s;erved his admiration. They did not fire
then from behind walls and lurking holes, but
bravely faced, attacked and defeated the tyrant's
forces. This appears &s;ufficiently, even from the
letter which has been artfully impo&s;ed on the pub|lic
for General Gage's genuine account of that
action; but let the Mini&s;ter &s;hew forth the Gene|ral's
real letter, if he dares. His ma&s;ter lo&s;t his
colour when he read it; and I verily believe that
even Lord North (the o&s;ten&s;ible Mini&s;ter) is not
him&s;elf entru&s;ted with the true contents of it. His

The real genuine letter (&s;o dreadful are its tidings)
is a &s;ecret to all but the tyrant, and his gemini,
the Ca&s;tor and Pollux of his cabinet, Bute and
Mansfield. They dare not publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>I am now come to the la&s;t effort within the
bounds of the General's duty, to &s;pare the effu&s;ion
of blood, which he is &s;trictly charged to &s;hed with|out
mercy or reluctance. The General, according
to his orders, mo&s;t dutifully di&s;patched his blu&s;ter|ing
Colonel Smith to commence the intended car|nage.
This bully failed; yet blood was unnatu|rally
and unju&s;tifiably drawn by our hireling cut|throats
at Concord; and then the General, in
commi&s;eration of the calamities which his murder|ous
army had occa&s;ioned, mo&s;t humanely offers,
two months afterwards (when he found him&s;elf un|equal
to the ta&s;k of conque&s;t) his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t
gracious pardon to the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers. Your
treacherous offer is di&s;dained&mdash;away with it!&mdash;
and ma&s;&s;acre (if you can) but without an in&s;ult,
the brave&s;t men in the Briti&s;h empire. Did not
the ance&s;tors of the&s;e brave &s;pirits &s;purn the in&s;i|dious
proclamation of that tyrant Charles, and
&s;hall their &s;ons fall a prey to the delu&s;ive orders
of a weaker tyrant, and a more con&s;ummate hypo|crite?
&mdash;Will not the gallant Adams, and the me|ritorious
Hancock fall with their country, if it is her
fate to fall? Or &s;hould they be unfortunately taken
<PB N="16" REF="18">
pri&s;oners, will they not ca&s;t an indignant &s;mile
upon the wretch who &s;hould affect to pardon them,
after he had en&s;laved their country? The pro|claiming
all America (except the King's Roman
Catholic &s;ubjects, and good allies at Quebec)
traitors, is but a contemptible echo of that act of
parliament which declared them &s;o long &s;ince, for
con&s;ulting and preparing only again&s;t an intended
ma&s;&s;acre by &s;word and famine.&mdash;America de&s;pi&s;es
your threats, your clemency, and all naval and
military terror and parade, thou impotent tyrant!
This General concludes his ga&s;conade with a mo&s;t
notorious fal&s;ehood, by a&s;&s;erting that the pre&s;ent
unnatural rebellion of the Americans (as he calls
it) has &s;topped the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in that
country.&mdash;For &s;hame, for &s;hame, General! A
&s;oldier, and guilty of a lye (&mdash;Your ma&s;ter knows,
you know, the whole world knows, that the rotten
Parliament of this nation not only &s;topped the
cour&s;e, but extingui&s;hed every benefit of the com|mon
law (the &s;ubjects great inheritance) when they
dared take away the privilege of juries. The de|&s;ign
was ba&s;e, atrocious, glaring, perfidious, and
tyrannical; but why does this unthinking tool of
military power call the royal charter of the pro|vince
to his aid; that charter, which his ma&s;ter
and his parliamentary junto has &s;o gro&s;sly violated?
Is that charter unfavourable to freedom, and can
it now &s;erve the cau&s;e of &s;lavery? Has it hitherto
<PB N="17" REF="19">
been &s;lighted, and is it now made u&s;e of to betray
the people for who&s;e protection it was granted?
Has it been &s;o often di&s;allowed, with an indignant
&s;neer, when America petitioned for redre&s;s, and is
it now &s;et up again&s;t her by the &s;hallow tools of
power, when &s;he is defending tho&s;e rights and liber|ties
which it gives her? Is this royal charter now
called in aid of de&s;potic mea&s;ures, through weak|ne&s;s,
in&s;olence, or inadvertency? Why, General!
General! Your haughty unrelenting ma&s;ter tram|ples
on the royal charters of his wi&s;er predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>I tell thee, Homicide, that the faith of Kings
is now no more. Our very laws mu&s;t &s;hortly
truckle to the &s;word. The law martial which you
have ju&s;t proclaimed, and of which you may &s;hortly
ta&s;te your&s;elf, will, if you &s;ucceed in America,
be at length the only law of England. Mansfield
is an advocate for &s;ummary proceedings.</P>
<P>The die is ca&s;t in the great divan (the wi&s;e
council of this nation) and tho&s;e who would RISE
AGAIN to the STATE and LIBERTIES of
ENGLISHMEN mu&s;t RISE through BLOOD.
The parricides of this con&s;titution, General, are
to be found in England, NOT IN AMERICA,
nor can HAPPINESS, PEACE, LIBERTY,
and LAW, be now re&s;tored (unle&s;s Providence
miraculou&s;ly intervenes) but by ANOTHER

<P>THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S

hell, is not ea&s;ily conquered: yet we have this
con&s;olation with us, that the harder the conflict,
the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain
too cheap, we e&s;teem too lightly: 'tis dearne&s;s only
that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows
how to &s;et a proper price upon its goods; and it
would be &s;trange, indeed, if &s;o cele&s;tial an article
as freedom &s;hould not be highly rated. Britain,
with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared
that &s;he has a right, not only to tax, but "to bind
us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:" and if being bound in
that manner is not &s;lavery, there is not &s;uch a thing
as &s;lavery upon earth. Even the expre&s;&s;ion is im|pious:
for &s;o unlimited a power can belong only to
God.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
Whether the independence of the continent was
declared too &s;oon, or delayed too long, I will not
now enter into as an argument: my own &s;imple
opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier,
it would have been much better. We did not
make a proper u&s;e of la&s;t winter; neither could
we, while we were in a dependent &s;ituation. How|ever,
the fault, if it were one, was all our own:
we have none to blame but our&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pre&s;ent winter is worth an age, if rightly employ|ed: but if lo&s;t, or neglected, the whole continent will par|take of the evil: and there is no puni&s;hment that man does not de&s;erve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of &s;acrificing a &s;ea&s;on &s;o precious and u&s;eful.</NOTE>. But no
great deal is lo&s;t yet: all that Howe has been doing
for this month pa&s;t, is rather a ravage than a con|que&s;t,
which the &s;pirit of the Jer&s;eys a year ago,
would have quickly repul&s;ed, and which time and
a little re&s;olution will &s;oon recover.</P>
<P>I have as little &s;uper&s;tition in me as any man
living: but my &s;ecret opinion has ever been, and
&s;till is, that God will not give up a people to mili|tary
de&s;truction, or leave them un&s;upportedly to
peri&s;h, who had &s;o earne&s;tly and &s;o repeatedly
&s;ought to avoid the calamities of war, by every de|cent
method which wi&s;dom could invent. Neither
have I &s;o much of the infidel in me, as to &s;uppo&s;e
that he has relinqui&s;hed the government of the
world, and given us up to the care of devils: and
as I do not, I cannot &s;ee on what grounds the king
<PB N="20" REF="22">
can look up to heaven for help again&s;t us. A com|mon
murderer, a highwayman, or a hou&s;ebreaker,
has as good a pretence as he.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how rapidly a panic will
&s;ometimes run through a country. All nations and
ages have been &s;ubject to them. Britain has trem|bled
like an ague, at the report of a French fleet of
flat-bottomed boats: and in the fourteenth cen|tury,
the whole Engli&s;h army, after ravaging the
kingdom of France, was driven back, like men
petrified with fear: and this brave exploit was
performed by a few broken forces, collected and
headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would that
heaven might in&s;pire &s;ome Jer&s;ey maid to &s;pirit up
her countrymen, and &s;ave her fair fellow &s;ufferers
from ravage and ravi&s;hment! Yet panics, in &s;ome
ca&s;es, have their u&s;es: they produce as much good
as hurt. Their duration is always &s;hort: the mind
&s;oon grows through them, and acquires a firmer
habit than before. But their peculiar advantage
is, that they are the touch&s;tones of &s;incerity and
hypocri&s;y, and bring things and men to light,
which might otherwi&s;e have lain for ever undi&s;co|vered.
In fact, they have the &s;ame effect upon
&s;ecret traitors, which an imaginary apparition would
upon a private murderer. They &s;ift out the pri|vate
thoughts of man, and hold them up in public
to the world. Many a di&s;gui&s;ed tory has lately
&s;hown his head, that &s;hall penitentially &s;olemnize
<PB N="21" REF="23">
with cur&s;es the day on which Howe arrived upon
the Delaware.</P>
<P>As I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and
marched with them to the edge of Penn&s;ylvania, I
am well acquainted with many circum&s;tances, which
tho&s;e, who lived at a di&s;tance, know but little
or nothing of. Our &s;ituation there was exceed|ingly
cramped, the place being on a narrow neck
of land, between the North river and the Hackin|&s;ack.
Our force was incon&s;iderable, being not one
fourth &s;o great as Howe could bring again&s;t us. We
had no army at hand to have relieved the garri&s;on,
had we &s;hut our&s;elves up, and &s;tood on the defence.
Our ammunition, light artillery, and the be&s;t part
of our &s;tores, had been removed, upon the appre|hen&s;ion
that Howe would endeavour to penetrate
the Jer&s;eys, in which ca&s;e Fort Lee could have been
of no u&s;e to us: for it mu&s;t occur to every think|ing
man, whether in the army or not, that the&s;e kinds
of field-forts are only fit for temporary purpo&s;es,
and la&s;t in u&s;e no longer than the enemy directs
his force again&s;t the particular object which &s;uch
forts were rai&s;ed to defend. Such was our &s;itu|ation
and condition at Fort Lee, on the morning
of the twentieth of November, when an officer
arrived with information, that the enemy, with two
hundred boats, had landed about &s;even or eight
miles above. Major-general Green, who com|manded
the garri&s;on, immediately ordered them
<PB N="22" REF="24">
under arms, and &s;ent expre&s;s to his Excellency
General Wa&s;hington, at the town of Hackin&s;ack,
di&s;tant, by way of the ferry, &s;ix miles. Our fir&s;t
object was to &s;ecure the bridge over the Hackin|&s;ack,
which lay up the river, between the enemy
and us, about &s;ix miles from us, and three from
them. General Wa&s;hington arrived in about three
quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of
the troops to the bridge, which place I expected
we &s;hould have a bru&s;h for: however, they did
not choo&s;e to di&s;pute it with us: and the greate&s;t
part of our troops went over the bridge, the re&s;t
over the ferry, except &s;ome which pa&s;&s;ed at a mill,
on a &s;mall creek, between the bridge and the ferry,
and made their way through &s;ome mar&s;hy grounds,
up to the town of Hackin&s;ack, and there pa&s;&s;ed the
river. We brought off as much baggage as the
waggons could contain: the re&s;t was lo&s;t. The
&s;imple object was to bring off the garri&s;on, and to
march them on till they could be &s;trengthened by
the Jer&s;ey or Penn&s;ylvania militia, &s;o as to be en|bled
to make a &s;tand. We &s;taid four days at New|ark,
collected in our out-po&s;ts, with &s;ome of the
Jer&s;ey militia, and marched out twice to meet the
enemy, on information of their being advancing,
though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs.
General Howe, in my opinion, committed a great
error in general&s;hip, in not throwing a body of &s;orces
off from Staten I&s;land through Amboy, by which
<PB N="23" REF="25">
means he might have &s;eized all our &s;tores at Brun&s;|wick,
and intercepted our march into Penn&s;ylva|nia.
But if we believe the power of hell to be
limited, we mu&s;t likewi&s;e believe that their agents
are under &s;ome providential controul.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now attempt to give all the particu|lars
of our retreat to the Delaware. Suffice it for
the pre&s;ent to &s;ay, that both officers and men,
though greatly harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued, frequently
without re&s;t, covering, or provi&s;ion, the inevitable
con&s;equences of a long retreat, bore it with a
manly and a martial &s;pirit. All their wi&s;hes were
one; which was, that the country would turn out,
and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire
has remarked, that king William never appeared to
full advantage, but in difficulties and in action.
The &s;ame remark may be made on General Wa&s;h|ington,
for the character fits him. There is a na|tural
firmne&s;s in &s;ome minds, which cannot be un|locked
by trifles; but which, when unlocked, di&s;|covers
a cabinet of fortitude: and I reckon it
among tho&s;e kind of public ble&s;&s;ings which we do
not immediately &s;ee, that God hath ble&s;&s;ed him
with uninterrupted health, and given him a mind
that can even flouri&s;h upon care.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with &s;ome mi&s;cella|neous
remarks on the &s;tate of our affairs; and &s;hall
begin with a&s;king the following que&s;tion: Why
is it that the enemy hath left the New England pro|vinces,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and made the&s;e middle ones the &s;eat of
war? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y: New England is not
infe&s;ted with Tories, and we are. I have been
tender in rai&s;ing the cry again&s;t the&s;e men, and u&s;ed
numberle&s;s arguments to &s;how them their danger:
but it will not do to &s;acrifice a world to either their
folly or their ba&s;ene&s;s. The period is now arrived,
in which either they or we mu&s;t change our &s;en|timents,
or one or both mu&s;t fall. And what is
a tory? Good God! what is he? I &s;hould not be
afraid to go with an hundred Whigs again&s;t a thou|&s;and
Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms.
Every Tory is a coward; for a &s;ervile, &s;lavi&s;h,
&s;elf-intere&s;ted fear is the foundation of toryi&s;m;
and a man under &s;uch influence, though he may be
cruel, never can be brave.</P>
<P>But before the line of irrecoverable &s;eparation
may be drawn between us, let us rea&s;on the matter
together: your conduct is an invitation to the
enemy; yet not one in a thou&s;and of you has heart
enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived
by you, as the American cau&s;e is injured by you.
He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to
his &s;tandard with mu&s;kets on your &s;houlders. Your
opinions are of no u&s;e to him, unle&s;s you &s;upport
him per&s;onally; for it is &s;oldiers, and not tories,
that he wants.</P>
<P>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man
ought to feel, again&s;t the mean principles that are
<PB N="25" REF="27">
held by the Tories. A noted one, who kept a
tavern at Amboy, was &s;tanding at his door, with
as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine
years old, as mo&s;t I ever &s;aw; and after &s;peaking
his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, fini&s;h|ed
with this unfatherly expre&s;&s;ion, "Well, give
me peace in my days." Not a man lives on the
continent, but fully believes that &s;eparation mu&s;t
&s;ome time or other finally take place, and a gene|rous
parent would have &s;aid, "if there mu&s;t be
trouble, let it be in my days, that my child may
have peace;" and this &s;ingle reflection, well ap|plied,
is &s;ufficient to awaken every man to duty.
Not a place upon earth might be &s;o happy as Ame|rica.
Her &s;ituation is remote from all the wrang|ling
world, and &s;he has nothing to do but to trade
with them. A man may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h in him|&s;elf
between temper and principle, and I am as
confident as I am that God governs the world, that
America will never be happy till &s;he gets clear of
foreign dominion. Wars, without cea&s;ing, will
break out till that period arrives, and the continent
mu&s;t, in the end be conqueror; for, though the
flame of liberty may &s;ometimes cea&s;e to &s;hine, the
coal never can expire.</P>
<P>America did not, nor does not want force; but
&s;he wanted a proper application of that force.
Wi&s;dom is not the purcha&s;e of a day and it is no
wonder we &s;hould on at fir&s;t &s;etting off. From an
<PB N="26" REF="28">
exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, we were unwilling to rai&s;e
an army, and tru&s;ted our cau&s;e to the temporary
defence of a well meaning militia. A &s;ummer's
experience has now taught us better; yet with tho&s;e
troops, while they were collected, we were able to
&s;et bounds to the progre&s;s of the enemy; and,
thank God! they are again a&s;&s;embling. I always
con&s;idered a militia as the be&s;t troops in the world
for a &s;udden exertion, but they will not do for a long
campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an at|tempt
on this city; &s;hould he fail on this &s;ide the
Delaware, he is ruined; if he &s;ucceeds, our cau&s;e
is not ruined. He &s;takes all on his &s;ide again&s;t a
part on ours; admitting he &s;ucceeds, the con&s;e|quence
will be, that armies from both ends of the
continent will march to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;uffering friends
in the middle &s;tates; for he cannot go every where:
it is impo&s;&s;ible. I con&s;ider Howe as the greate&s;t
enemy the tories have; he is bringing a war into
their own country, which, had it not been for him
and partly for them&s;elves, they had been clear of.
Should he now be expelled, I wi&s;h, with all the
devotion of a chri&s;tian, that the names of whig and
tory may never more be mentioned; but &s;hould the
tories give him encouragement to come, or a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
if he come, I as &s;incerely wi&s;h that our next
year's arms may expel them from the continent,
and the congre&s;s appropriate their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to
the relief of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered in well-doing.
<PB N="27" REF="29">
A &s;ingle &s;ucce&s;sful battle next year will &s;ettle the
whole. America will carry on a two-years war by
the confi&s;cation of the property of di&s;affected per|&s;ons,
and be made happy by their expul&s;ion. Say
not that this is revenge: call it rather the &s;oft re|&s;entment
of a &s;uffering people, who, having no
object in view but the good of all, have &s;taked
their own all upon a &s;eemingly doubtful event.
Yet it is folly to argue again&s;t determined hardne&s;s:
eloquence may &s;trike the car, and the language of
&s;orrow draw forth the tear of compa&s;&s;ion, but
nothing can reach the heart that is &s;teeled with
prejudice.</P>
<P>Quitting this cla&s;s of men, I turn, with the
warm ardour of a friend, to tho&s;e who have nobly
&s;tood, and are yet determined to &s;tand the matter
out. I call not upon a few, but upon all; not on
this &s;tate, or that &s;tate, but on every &s;tate. Up
and help us. Lay your &s;houlders to the wheel.
Better have too much force than too little, when
&s;o great an object is at &s;take. Let it be told to the
future world, that in the depth of winter, when
nothing but hope and virtue could &s;urvive, that
the city and the country, alarmed at one common
danger, came forth to meet and to repul&s;e it. Say
not that thou&s;ands are gone: turn out your tens of
thou&s;ands: throw not the burden of the day upon
providence, but &s;how your faith by your good
works, that God may ble&s;s you. It matters not
<PB N="28" REF="30">
where you live, or what rank of life you hold; the
evil or the ble&s;&s;ing will reach you all. The far
and the near, the home counties and the back,
the rich and the poor, &s;hall &s;uffer or rejoice alike.
The heart that feels not now, is dead. The blood
of his children &s;hall cur&s;e his cowardice, who
&s;hrinks back at a time when a little might have
&s;aved the whole and made them happy. I love
the man that can &s;mile in trouble&mdash;that can gather
&s;trength from di&s;tre&s;s, and grow brave by reflec|tion.
It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of little minds to &s;hrink;
but he, who&s;e heart is firm, and who&s;e con&s;cience
approves his conduct, will pur&s;ue his principles
unto death. My own line of rea&s;oning is to my|&s;elf,
as &s;trait and clear as a ray of light. Not all
the trea&s;ures of the world, &s;o far as I believe,
could have induced me to &s;upport an offen&s;ive
war; for I think it murder: but if a thief break
into my hou&s;e&mdash;burn and de&s;troy my property,
and kill, or threaten to kill me and tho&s;e that are in
it, and to "bind me in all ca&s;es what&s;oever," to his
ab&s;olute will, am I to &s;uffer it? What &s;ignifies it
to me, whether he who does it, is a king or a com|mon
man; my countryman, or not my country|man;
whether it is done by an individual villain,
or an army of them? If we rea&s;on to the root of
things we &s;hall find no difference; neither can any
ju&s;t cau&s;e be a&s;&s;igned, why we &s;hould puni&s;h in the
one ca&s;e and pardon in the other. Let them call
<PB N="29" REF="31">
me rebel, and welcome; I feel no concern from it;
but I &s;hould &s;uffer the mi&s;ery of devils, were
I to make a whore of my &s;oul, by &s;wearing allegi|ance
to one who&s;e character is that of a &s;otti&s;h,
&s;tupid, &s;tubborn, worthle&s;s, bruti&s;h man. I con|ceive
likewi&s;e, a horrid idea in receiving mercy
from a being, who at the la&s;t day, &s;hall be &s;hriek|ing
to the rocks and mountains to cover him, and
fleeing with terror from the orphan, the widow, and
the &s;lain of America.</P>
<P>There are ca&s;es which cannot be overdone by
language; and this is one. There are per&s;ons too,
who &s;ee not the full extent of the evil that threatens
them. They &s;olace them&s;elves with hopes, that
the enemy, if they &s;ucceed, will be merciful. It
is the madne&s;s of folly, to expect mercy from tho&s;e
who have refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice: and even mercy,
where conque&s;t is the object, is only a trick of
war. The cunning of the fox is as murderous as
the violence of the wolf, and we ought to be
equally on our guard again&s;t both. Howe's fir&s;t
object is partly by threats, and partly by promi&s;es,
to terrify or &s;educe the people to give up thei
arms, and receive mercy. The mini&s;try recom|mended
the &s;ame plan to Gage: and this is what
the tories call making their peace&mdash;"a peace
which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding," indeed. A
peace which would be the immediate forerunner o
a wor&s;e ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye
<PB N="30" REF="32">
men of Penn&s;ylvania, do rea&s;on upon tho&s;e things!
Were the back counties to give up their arms, they
would fall an ea&s;y prey to the Indians, who are
all armed. This, perhaps, is what &s;ome tories
would not be &s;orry for. Were the home counties
to deliver up their arms, they would be expo&s;ed
to the re&s;entment of the back counties, who would
then have it in their power to cha&s;ti&s;e their defection
at plea&s;ure. And were any one &s;tate to give up
its arms, that &s;tate mu&s;t be garri&s;oned by all Howe's
army of Britons and He&s;&s;ians, to pre&s;erve it from
the anger of the re&s;t. Mutual fear is a principal
link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to
that &s;tate that breaks the compact. Howe is mer|cifully
inviting you to a barbarous de&s;truction, and
men mu&s;t be either rogues or fools that will not &s;ee
it. I dwell not upon the vapours of imagination,
I bring rea&s;on to your ears; and in language as
plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.</P>
<P>I thank God, that I fear not. I &s;ee no real
cau&s;e for fear. I know our &s;ituation well, and can
&s;ee the way out of it. While our army was col|lected,
Howe dared not ri&s;k a battle: and it is no
credit to him, that he decamped from the White
Plains, and waited a mean opportunity to ravage
the defencele&s;s Jer&s;eys: but it is great credit to us&punc;
that, with an handful of men, we &s;u&s;tained an
orderly retreat for near an hundred miles, brought
off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the
<PB N="31" REF="33">
greate&s;t part of our &s;tores, and had four rivers to
pa&s;s. None can &s;ay, that our retreat was precipi|tate&punc;
for we were near three weeks in performing
it, that the country might have time to come in.
Twice we marched back to meet the enemy, and
remained out till dark. The &s;ign of fear was not
&s;een in our camp: and had not &s;ome of the cow|ardly
and di&s;affected inhabitants &s;pread fal&s;e alarms
through the country, the Jer&s;eys had never been
ravaged. Once more, we are again collected and
collecting. Our new army, at both ends of the
continent, is recruiting fa&s;t; and we &s;hall be able
to open the next campaign with &s;ixty thou&s;and men,
well armed and cloathed. This is our &s;ituation&mdash;
and who will, may know it. By per&s;everance
and fortitude, we have the pro&s;pect of a glorious
i&s;&s;ue; by cowardice and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the &s;ad choice
of a variety of evils&mdash;a ravaged country&mdash;a depo|pulated
city&mdash;habitations without &s;afety&mdash;and
&s;lavery without hope&mdash;our homes turned into bar|racks
and bawdy-hou&s;es for He&s;&s;ians&mdash;and a future
race to provide for, who&s;e fathers we &s;hall doubt
of! Look on this picture, and weep over it! and if
there yet remains one thoughtle&s;s wretch, who be|lieves
it not, let him &s;uffer it unlamented.</P>

<L>To bring my grievance to the public ear? <BIBL>CHURCHILL.</BIBL></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO LORD HOWE.</HEAD>
<P>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a
writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and
though he cannot command their obedience, he
can a&s;&s;ign them their duty. The republic of let|ters
is more ancient than monarchy, and of far
higher character in the world than the va&s;&s;al court
of Britain; he that rebels again&s;t rea&s;on is a real
rebel, but he that in defence of rea&s;on, rebels
again&s;t tyranny, has a better title to "defender
of the faith" than George the third.</P>
<P>As a military man, your lord&s;hip may hold out
the &s;word of war, and call it the <HI>"ultima ratio re|gum</HI>;"
the la&s;t rea&s;on of kings; we in return can
&s;hew you the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and call it, "the
be&s;t &s;courge of tyrants." The fir&s;t of the&s;e two
<PB N="33" REF="35">
may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and
ca&s;t a &s;ickly langour over an in&s;ulted people, but
rea&s;on will &s;oon recover the debauch, and re&s;tore
them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lord&s;hip,
I find, has now commenced author, and publi&s;hed
a Proclamation; I too have publi&s;hed a Cri&s;is;
as they &s;tand, they are the antipodes of each other;
both cannot ri&s;e at once, and one of them mu&s;t
de&s;cend: and &s;o quick is the revolution of things,
that your Lord&s;hip's performance, I &s;ee, has al|ready
fallen many degrees from its fir&s;t place, and
is now ju&s;t vi&s;ible on the edge of the political ho|rizon.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing to what a pitch of infatuation blind
folly and ob&s;tinacy will carry mankind, and your
Lord&s;hip's drow&s;y Proclamation is a proof that it
does not even quit them in their &s;leep. Perhaps
you thought America too was taking a nap, and
therefore cho&s;e, like Satan to Eve, to whi&s;per the
delu&s;ion &s;oftly, le&s;t you &s;hould awaken her. This
continent, Sir, is too exten&s;ive to &s;leep all at
once, and too watchful, even in its &s;lumbers, not
to &s;tartle at the unhallowed foot of an invader.
You may i&s;&s;ue your proclamations, and welcome,
for we have learned to "reverence our&s;elves,"
and &s;corn the in&s;ulting ruffian that employs you.
America, for your decea&s;ed brother's &s;ake, would
gladly have &s;hewn you re&s;pect, and it is a new
aggravation to her &s;eelings, that Howe &s;hould be
<PB N="34" REF="36">
forgetful, and rai&s;e his &s;word again&s;t tho&s;e, who at
their own charge rai&s;ed a monument to his bro|ther.
But your ma&s;ter has commanded, and you
have not enough of nature left to refu&s;e. Surely
there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trangely degenerating in
the love of monarchy, that can &s;o completely wear
a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to
lick the du&s;t that kings have trode upon. A few
more years, &s;hould you &s;urvive them, will be&s;tow
on you the title of an old man, and in &s;ome hour
of future reflection you may probably find the
fitne&s;s of Wol&s;ey's de&s;pairing penitence, "Had
I &s;erved my God as faithfully as I have &s;erved
my king, he would not thus have for&s;aken me
in my old age."</P>
<P>The character you appear to us in is truly ridi|culous.
Your friends, the tories, announced your
coming with high de&s;criptions of your unlimited
powers; but your Proclamation has given them
the lie, by &s;hewing you to be a commi&s;&s;ioner with|out
authority. Had your powers been ever &s;o
great, they were nothing to us, farther than we
plea&s;ed; becau&s;e we had the &s;ame right which
other nations had, to do what we thought was
be&s;t. "The United States of America," will
found as pompou&s;ly in the world, or in hi&s;tory, as
"the Kingdom of Great Britain;" the character of
General Wa&s;hington will fill a page with as much
lu&s;tre as that of Lord Howe; and the congre&s;s
<PB N="35" REF="37">
have as much right to command the king and par|liament
of London to de&s;i&s;t from legi&s;lation, as
they or you have to command the congre&s;s. Only
&s;uppo&s;e how laughable &s;uch an edict would appear
from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but
turn the tables upon your&s;elf, and you will &s;ee
how your Proclamation is received here. Having
thus placed you in a proper po&s;ition, in which you
may have a full view of folly, and learn to de&s;pi&s;e
it, I hold up to you, for that purpo&s;e, the follow|ing
quotation from your own lunarian Proclama|tion.
"And we (Lord Howe and General Howe)
do command (and in his Maje&s;ty's name for|&s;ooth),
all &s;uch per&s;ons as are a&s;&s;embled toge|ther
under the name of general or provincial
congre&s;&s;es, committees, conventions, or other
a&s;&s;ociations, by whatever name or names known
or di&s;tingui&s;hed, to de&s;i&s;t and cea&s;e from all
&s;uch trea&s;onable actings and doings."</P>
<P>You introduce your Proclamation by referring
to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th
of September. In the la&s;t of the&s;e, you &s;unk
your&s;elf below the character of a private gentle|man.
That I may not &s;eem to accu&s;e you un|ju&s;tly,
I &s;hall &s;tate the circum&s;tance: By a verbal
invitation of yours, communicated to congre&s;s by
General Sullivan, then a pri&s;oner on his parole,
you &s;ignified your de&s;ire of conferring with &s;ome
members of that body as private gentlemen. It
<PB N="36" REF="38">
was beneath the dignity of the American congre&s;s
to pay any regard to a me&s;&s;age that at be&s;t was
but a genteel affront, and had too much of the
mini&s;terial complexion of tampering with private
per&s;ons; and which might probably have been the
ca&s;e, had the gentlemen, who were deputed on that
bu&s;ine&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that ea&s;y kind of virtue which
an Engli&s;h courtier is &s;o truly di&s;tingui&s;hed by.
Your reque&s;t, however, was complied with, for
hone&s;t men are naturally more tender of their civil
than their political fame. The interview ended
as every sensible man thought it would; for your
Lord&s;hip knows, as well as the writer of the Cri&s;is,
that it is impossible for the King of England to
promi&s;e the repeal, or even the revi&s;al, of any
acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part you
had nothing to &s;ay, more than to reque&s;t, in the
room of demanding the entire &s;urrender of the
continent; and then, if that was complied with,
to promise the that the inhabitants &s;hould e&s;cape with
their lives. This was the up&s;hot of the conference.
You informed the conferees that you were two
months in &s;oliciting the&s;e powers. We a&s;k, what
powers&punc; for, as commi&s;&s;ioner, you have none. If
you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique
proof, that your ma&s;ter was determined to &s;acri|fice
all before him; and that you were two months
in di&s;&s;uading him from his purpo&s;e. Another evi|dence
of his &s;avage ob&s;tinacy! From your own
<PB N="37" REF="39">
account of the matter, we may ju&s;tly draw the&s;e
two conclu&s;ions: fir&s;t, that you &s;erve a mon&s;ter;
and &s;econdly, that never was a commi&s;&s;ioner &s;ent
on a more fooli&s;h errand than your&s;elf. This
plain language may perhaps &s;ound uncoothly to an
ear vitiated by courtly re&s;inements; but words
were made for u&s;e, and the fault lies in de&s;erving
them, or the abu&s;e in applying them unfairly.</P>
<P>Soon after your return to New-York, you pub|li&s;hed
a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill again&s;t
the congre&s;s; for it was certainly &s;tepping out of
the line of common civility, fir&s;t to &s;creen your
national pride by &s;oliciting an interview with them
as private gentlemen, and in the conclu&s;ion to en|deavour
to deceive the multitude by making an
hand-bill attack on the whole body of the congre&s;s;
you got them together under one name, and abu&s;ed
them under another. But the king you &s;erve, and
the cau&s;e you &s;upport, afford you &s;o few in&s;tances
of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your
&s;ituation, the congre&s;s pardoned the in&s;ult by tak|ing
no notice of it.</P>
<P>You &s;ay in that hand-bill, "that they, the con|gre&s;s,
di&s;avowed every purpo&s;e for reconcilia|tion
not con&s;onant with their extravagant and
inadmi&s;&s;ible claim of independence."</P>
<P>Why, God ble&s;s me! what have you to do with
our independence? we a&s;ked no leave of yours to
&s;et it up; we a&s;k no money of yours to &s;upport it;
<PB N="38" REF="40">
we can do better without your fleets and armies
than with them; you may &s;oon have enough to do
to protect your&s;elves without being burthened with
us. We are very willing to be at peace with you,
to buy of you and &s;ell to you, and, like young be|ginners
in the world, to work for our own living;
therefore, why do you put your&s;elves out of ca&s;h,
when we know you cannot &s;pare it, and we do not
de&s;ire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir,
you &s;hould &s;ee your folly in every view I can
place it, and for that rea&s;on de&s;cend &s;ometimes to
tell you in je&s;t what I wi&s;h you to &s;ee in earne&s;t.
But to be more &s;erious with you, why do you &s;ay
"their" independence? To &s;et you right, Sir,
we tell you, that the independency is ours, not
theirs. The congre&s;s were authori&s;ed, by every
&s;tate on the continent, to publi&s;h it to all the world,
and in &s;o doing are not to be con&s;idered as the in|ventors,
but only as the heralds that proclaimed
it, or the office from which the &s;en&s;e of the peo|ple
received a legal form; and it was as much as
any or all their heads were worth, to have treated
with you, on the &s;ubject of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, under any
name whatever. But we know the men in whom
we have tru&s;ted;&mdash;can England &s;ay the &s;ame of
her parliament?</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to your Procla|mation
of the 30th of November la&s;t. Had you
gained an entire conque&s;t over all the armies of
<PB N="39" REF="41">
America, and then put forth a proclamation, of|fering
(what you call) mercy, your conduct would
have had &s;ome &s;pacious &s;hew of humanity; but to
creep by &s;urpri&s;e into a province, and there en|deavour
to terrify and &s;educe the inhabitants from
their ju&s;t allegiance to the re&s;t, by promi&s;es which
you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both
cruel and unmanly: cruel in its effects; becau&s;e,
unle&s;s you can keep all the ground you have
marched over, how are you, in the words of your
Proclamation, to &s;ecure to your pro&s;elytes "the
enjoyment of their property?" What are to be|come
either of your new-adopted &s;ubjects, or your
old friends the tories, in Burlington, Bordentown,
Trenton, Montholly, and many other places, where
you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled
with the precipitation of a pur&s;ued thief? What,
I &s;ay, are to become of tho&s;e wretches? What
are to become of tho&s;e who went over to you from
this city and &s;tate? What more can you &s;ay to
them than "&s;hift for your&s;elves?" Or what more
can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds
over the face of the earth? You may now tell
them to take their leave of America, and all that
once was theirs. Recommend them, for con&s;ola|tion,
to your ma&s;ter's court: there perhaps they
may make a &s;hift to live on the &s;craps of &s;ome dang|ling
para&s;ite, and chu&s;e companions among thou|&s;ands
<PB N="40" REF="42">
like them&s;elves. A traitor is the foule&s;t fiend
on earth.</P>
<P>In a political &s;en&s;e we ought to thank you for
thus bequeathing e&s;tates to the continent; we &s;hall
&s;oon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war with|out
expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of
Lord Howe, and the generous defection of the
tories. Had you &s;et your foot into this city, you
would have be&s;towed e&s;tates upon us which we ne|ver
thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were
unwilling to &s;u&s;pect. "But the&s;e men" you will
&s;ay, "are his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects;" let
that honour then be all their fortune, and let his
maje&s;ty take them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am now thoroughly di&s;gu&s;ted with them; they
live in ungrateful ca&s;e, and bend their whole minds
to mi&s;chief. It &s;eems as if God had given them
over to a &s;pirit of infidelity, and that they are open
to conviction in no other line but that of puni&s;h|ment.
It is time to have done with tarring, feather|ing,
carting, and taking &s;ecurities for their future
good behaviour. Every &s;en&s;ible man mu&s;t feel a
con&s;cious &s;hame at &s;eeing a poor fellow hawked for
a &s;hew about the &s;treets, when it is known, that he is
only the tool of &s;ome principal villian, bla&s;&s;ed into
his offence by the force of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, or bribed
thereto through &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity. We di&s;honour our|&s;elves
by attacking &s;uch trifling characters, while
greater ones are &s;uffered to e&s;cape. 'Tis our duty
<PB N="41" REF="43">
to find them out, and their proper puni&s;hment
would be to exile them from the continent for ever.
The circle of them is not &s;o great as &s;ome ima|gine.
The influence of a &s;ew has tainted many
who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circu|lation
of lies among tho&s;e who are not much in the
way of hearing them contradicted, will in time pa&s;s
for truth: and the crime lies not in the believer,
but the inventor. I am not for declaring war
again&s;t every man that appears not &s;o warm as my|&s;elf.
Difference of con&s;titution, temper, habit of
&s;peaking, and many other things, will go a great
way in &s;ixing the outward character of a man, yet
&s;imple hone&s;ty may remain at bottom. Some men
have naturally a military turn, and can brave hard|&s;hips
and the ri&s;k of life, with a chearful face: others
have not; no &s;lavery appears to them &s;o great as
the fatigue of arms, and no terror &s;o powerful as
that of per&s;onal danger. What can we &s;ay; We
cannot alter nature; neither ought we to puni&s;h
the &s;on becau&s;e the father begot him in a cowardly
mood. However, I believe mo&s;t men have more
courage than they know of, and that a little at fir&s;t
is enough to begin with. I knew the time when
I thought that the whi&s;tling of a cannon ball would
have frightened me almo&s;t to death: but I have
&s;ince tried it, and find I can &s;tand it with as little
di&s;compo&s;ure, and (I believe) with a much ea&s;ier
con&s;cience than your Lord&s;hip. The &s;ame dread
<PB N="42" REF="44">
would return to me again, were I in your &s;ituation:
for my &s;olemn belief of your cau&s;e, is, that it is
helli&s;h and damnable: and under that conviction,
every thinking man's heart mu&s;t fail him.</P>
<P>From a concern, that a good cau&s;e &s;hould be
di&s;honoured by the lea&s;t di&s;union among us, I &s;aid
in my former paper, No. II. that, "&s;hould the ene|my
now be expelled, I wi&s;h, with all the &s;ince|rity
of a chri&s;tian, that the names of whig and
tory might never more be mentioned:" but there
is a knot of men among us, of &s;uch a venomous
ca&s;t, that they will not admit even one's good wi&s;hes
to act in their favour. In&s;tead of rejoicing that
heaven had, as it were, providentially pre&s;erved
this city from plunder and de&s;truction, by deli|vering
&s;o great a part of the enemy into our hands,
with &s;o little effu&s;ion of blood, they &s;tubbornly
affected to di&s;believe it, until within an hour, nay
half an hour of the pri&s;oners arriving: and the
quakers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole &s;ocieties of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown fet of men, who claim to them&s;elves the right of repre&s;enting the whole; and while the whole &s;ociety of Quak|ers admit its validity by a &s;ilent acknowledgment, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that any di&s;tinction can be made by the public; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permi&s;&s;ion of our enemies, &s;ays, that "the Quakers begin to &s;peak openly of their attachment to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution." We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wi&s;h to know them.</NOTE> put forth a te&s;timony, dated the twentieth
of December, &s;igned John Pemberton, declaring
their attachment to the Briti&s;h government. The&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="45">
men are continually harping on the great &s;in of our
bearing arms: but the king of Briton may lay wa&s;te
the world in blood and famine, and they, poor
fallen &s;ouls, have nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>In &s;ome future paper, I intend to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
the different kinds of per&s;ons who have been
denominated tories: for this I am clear in, that all
are not &s;o, who have been called &s;o, nor all men
whigs, who were once thought &s;o: and as I mean
not to conceal the name of any true friend, when
there &s;hall be occa&s;ion to mention him; neither
will I that of an enemy, who ought to be known,
let his rank, &s;tation, or religion be what it may.</P>
<P>Much pains have been taken by &s;ome to &s;et your
Lord&s;hip's private character in an amiable light:
but as it has chiefly been done by men who know
nothing about you, and who are no ways remark|able
for their attachment to us, we have no ju&s;t
authority for believing it. George the Third was
impo&s;ed upon us by the &s;ame arts: but time has
at length done him ju&s;tice: and the &s;ame fate may
probably attend your Lord&s;hip. Your avowed
purpo&s;e here, is, to kill, conquer, plunder, par|don,
and en&s;lave: and the ravages of your army,
through the Jer&s;eys, have been marked with as
much barbari&s;m, as if you had openly profe&s;&s;ed
your&s;elf the prince of ruffians. Not even the ap|pearance
of humanity has been pre&s;erved either on
the march or the retreat of your troops. No ge|neral
<PB N="44" REF="46">
order, that I could ever learn, has ever been
i&s;&s;ued to prevent or even forbid your troops from
robbery, wherever they came: and the only in|&s;tance
of ju&s;tice, if it can be called &s;uch, which
has di&s;tingui&s;hed you for impartiality, is, that you
treated and plundered all alike. What could not
be carried away, have been de&s;troyed: and maho|gany
furniture has been deliberately laid on the fire
for fuel, rather than the men &s;hould be fatigued
with cutting wood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;ome people may doubt the truth of &s;uch wanton de|&s;truction, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this informa|tion at the hou&s;e of Mr. Michael Hutchin&s;on (one of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion), who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Penn&s;yl|vania &s;ide, Mr. Hutchin&s;on being pre&s;ent.</NOTE>. There was a time, when the
whigs confided much in your &s;uppo&s;ed candour,
and the tories re&s;ted them&s;elves on your favour.
The experiments have now been made, and failed:
and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jer&s;eys
where your arms have been, is a te&s;timony again&s;t
you. How you may re&s;t under this &s;acrifice of
character, I know not: but this I know, that you
&s;leep and ri&s;e with the daily cur&s;es of thou&s;ands
upon you. Perhaps, the mi&s;ery which the tories
have &s;uffered by your proffered mercy, may give
them &s;ome claim to their country's pity, and be in
the end the be&s;t favour you could &s;hew them.</P>
<P> In a folio general order book belonging to Co|lonel
Rahl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now
<PB N="45" REF="47">
now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the council of &s;afety for
this &s;tate, the following barbarous order is fre|quently
repeated: "His excellency the commander
in chief orders that all inhabitants which &s;hall be
found with arms, not having an officer with them,
&s;hall be immediately taken and hung up." How
many you may thus have privately &s;acrificed, we
know not; and the account can only be &s;ettled in
another world. Your treatment of pri&s;oners, in
order to di&s;tre&s;s them to enli&s;t into your infernal
&s;ervice, is not to be equalled by any in&s;tance in
Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe, and
his brother, whom the tories, and their three-quarter
kindred, the quakers, or &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, have
been holden up for patterns of ju&s;tice and mercy!</P>
<P>A bad cau&s;e will ever be &s;upported by bad means,
and bad men: and whoever will be at the pains of
examining &s;trictly into things, will find that one and
the &s;ame &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition and impiety, more or
le&s;s, governs through your whole party in both
countries. Not many days ago, I accidentally fell
in company with a per&s;on of this city, noted for
e&s;pou&s;ing your cau&s;e; and on my remarking to him,
that it appeared clear to me, by the late providen|tial
turn of affairs, that God Almighty was vi&s;ibly
on our &s;ide; he replied, we care nothing for that;
you may have him, and welcome; if we have but
enough of the devil on our &s;ide, we &s;hall do.
However carele&s;sly this be &s;poken, matters not;
<PB N="46" REF="48">
'tis &s;till the in&s;en&s;ible principle that directs all your
conduct, and will at la&s;t mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly deceive
and ruin you.</P>
<P>If ever a nation was mad and fooli&s;h, blind to
its own intere&s;t, and bent on its own de&s;truction, it
is Britain. There are &s;uch things as national &s;ins:
and though the puni&s;hment of individuals may be
re&s;erved to another world, national puni&s;hment can
only be inflicted in this world. Britain, as a na|tion,
is, in my inmo&s;t belief, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t
ungrateful offender again&s;t God, on the face of the
whole earth. Ble&s;&s;ed with all the commerce &s;he
could wi&s;h for, and furni&s;hed by a va&s;t extent of
dominion, with the means of civilizing both the
ea&s;tern and we&s;tern world, &s;he has made no other
u&s;e of both, than proudly to idolize her own
"thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole coun|tries,
for what &s;he could get. Like Alexander,
&s;he has made war her &s;port, and inflicted mi&s;ery
for prodigality &s;ake. The blood of India is not
yet repaid, nor the wretchedne&s;s of Africa yet re|quited.
Of late, &s;he has enlarged her lift of na|tional
cruelties, by her butcherly de&s;truction of
the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and in returning an
an&s;wer by the &s;word, to the meek prayer for "peace,
liberty, and &s;afety." The&s;e are &s;erious things:
and whatever a fooli&s;h tyrant, a debauched court,
a trafficking legi&s;lature, or a blinded people, may
think, the national account with heaven mu&s;t &s;ome
<PB N="47" REF="49">
day or other be &s;ettled. All countries have &s;ooner or
later been called to their reckoning. The proude&s;t
empires have &s;unk, when the balance was &s;truck:
and Britain, like an individual penitent, mu&s;t un|dergo
her day of &s;orrow, and the &s;ooner it hap|pens
to her the better. As I wi&s;h it over, I wi&s;h
it to come, but withal wi&s;h that it may be as light
as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Perhaps your Lord&s;hip has no ta&s;te for &s;erious
things. By your connexions in England, I &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e not: therefore I &s;hall drop this part of the
&s;ubject, and take it up in a line in which you
will better under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>By what means, may I a&s;k, do you expect to
conquer America? If you could not effect it in
the &s;ummer when our army was le&s;s than yours,
nor in the winter, when we had none, how are
you to do it? In point of general&s;hip, you have
been outwitted; and in point of fortitude, outdone:
your advantages turn out to your lo&s;s, and &s;hew us
that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts. Like
a game of drafts, we can move out of one &s;quare,
to let you come in, in order that we may after|wards
take two or three for one; and as we can
always keep a double corner for our&s;elves, we can
always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be &s;o
in&s;en&s;ible, as not to &s;ee that we have two to one
the advantage of you, becau&s;e we conquer by a
drawn game, and you lo&s;e by it. Burgoyne might
<PB N="48" REF="50">
have taught your Lord&s;hip this knowledge; he has
been long a &s;tudent in the doctrine of chances.</P>
<P>I have no other idea of conquering countries
than by &s;ubduing the armies which defend them:
have you done this, or can you do this? If you
have not, it would be civil in you to let your pro|clamations
alone for the pre&s;ent; otherwi&s;e, you
will ruin more tories by your grace and favour than
you will whigs by your arms.</P>
<P>Were you to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this city, you
would not know what to do with it, more than to
plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold
New York, would be an additional dead weight
upon your hands: and if a general conque&s;t is
your object, you had better be without the city
than with it. When you have defeated all our
armies, the cities will fall into your hands of them|&s;elves;
but to creep into them in the manner you
got into Princetown, Trenton, &amp;c. is like robbing
an orchard in the night, before the fruit be ripe,
and running away in the morning. Your experi|ment
in the Jer&s;eys is &s;ufficient to teach you that
you have &s;omething more to do than barely to get
into other people's hou&s;es; and your new converts
to whom you promi&s;ed all manner of protection,
and &s;educed into new guilt by pardoning them
from their former virtues, mu&s;t begin to have a
very contemptible opinion both of your power and
policy. Your authority in the Jer&s;eys is now re|duced
<PB N="49" REF="51">
to the &s;mall circle which your army occu|pies,
and your Proclamation is no where el&s;e &s;een,
unle&s;s it be to be laughed at. The mighty &s;ub|duers
of the continent are retreated into a nut&s;hell,
and the proud forgivers of our &s;ins are fled from
tho&s;e they came to pardon; and all this at a time
when they were di&s;patching ve&s;&s;el after ve&s;&s;el to
England, with the great news of every day. In
&s;hort, you have managed your Jer&s;ey expedition
&s;o very dexterou&s;ly, that the dead only are con|querors,
becau&s;e none will di&s;pute the ground with
them. In all the wars you have formerly been
concerned in, you had only armies to contend
with; in this ca&s;e, you have both an army and a
country to combat with. In former wars, the
countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca|nada
fell with Quebec; and Minorca, with Port
Mahon or St. Philips; by &s;ubduing tho&s;e, the con|querors
opened a way into, and became ma&s;ters
of the country: here it is otherwi&s;e: if you get
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a city here, you are obliged to &s;hut
your&s;elves up in it, and can make no other u&s;e of
it, than to &s;pend your country's money in. This
is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York;
and you would draw le&s;s from Philadelphia,
becau&s;e it requires more force to keep it, and is
much farther from the &s;ea. A pretty figure you
and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river
full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the imme|diate
<PB N="50" REF="52">
con&s;equence of your getting here would be,
that you would be cannonaded out again, and the
tories be obliged to make good the damage; and
this, &s;ooner or later, will be the fate of New York.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to &s;ee the city &s;aved, not &s;o much from
military, as from natural motives. It is the hiding-place
of women and children, and Lord Howe's
proper bu&s;ine&s;s is with our armies. When I put
all the circum&s;tances together which ought to be
taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering Ame|rica.
Becau&s;e you lived in a little country, where
an army might run over the whole in a few days,
and where a &s;ingle company of &s;oldiers might
put a multitude to the rout, you expected to
find it the &s;ame here. It is plain that you brought
over with you all the narrow notions you were
bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation
in the king's name was to do great things; but
Engli&s;hmen always travel for knowledge, and your
Lord&s;hip, I hope, will return, if you return at all,
much wi&s;er than you came.</P>
<P>We may be &s;urpri&s;ed by events we did not ex|pect,
and in that interval of recollection you may
gain &s;ome temporary advantage: &s;uch was the ca&s;e
a few weeks ago: but we &s;oon ripen again into
rea&s;on, collect our &s;trength, and while you are
preparing for a triumph, we come upon you with
a defeat. Such it has been&punc; and &s;uch it would be
were you to try it an hundred times over. Were
<PB N="51" REF="53">
you to garri&s;on the places you might march over,
in order to &s;ecure their &s;ubjection (for remember
you can do it by no other means), your army
would be like a &s;tream of water running to no|thing.
By the time you reached from New York
to Virginia, you would be reduced to a &s;tring of
drops not capable of hanging together; while we
by retreating from &s;tate to &s;tate, like a river turn|ing
back upon it&s;elf, would acquire &s;trength in
the &s;ame proportion as you lo&s;t it, and in the end
be capable of overwhelming you. The country
in the mean time would &s;uffer; but it is a day of
&s;uffering, and we ought to expect it. What we
contend for is worthy the affliction we may go
through. If we get but bread to eat, and any
kind of raiment to put on, we ought, not only to
be contented, but thankful: more than that we
ought not to look for; and le&s;s than that, heaven
has not yet &s;uffered us to want. He that would
fell his birth-right for a little &s;alt, is as worthle&s;s
as he who &s;old it for porrage without falt: and he
that would part with it for a gay coat, or a plain
coat, ought for ever to be a &s;lave in buff. What
are &s;alt, &s;ugar, and finery, to the ine&s;timable ble&s;|&s;ings
of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the
inconveniences of a few months to the tributary
bondage of ages? The meane&s;t pea&s;ant in Ame|rica,
ble&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, is a happy man,
compared with a New York tory; he can eat his
<PB N="52" REF="54">
mor&s;el without repining, and when he has done,
can &s;weeten it with a repa&s;t of whole&s;ome air; he
can take his child by the hand and ble&s;s it, with|out
feeling the con&s;cious &s;hame of neglecting a
parent's duty.</P>
<P>In publi&s;hing the&s;e remarks, I have &s;everal ob|jects
in view. On your part they are, to expo&s;e
the folly of your pretended authority, as a commi&s;|&s;ioner&mdash;the
wickedne&s;s of your cau&s;e in general&mdash;
and the impo&s;&s;ibility of your conquering us at any
rate. On the part of the public, my meaning is,
to &s;hew them their true and &s;olid intere&s;t; to en|courage
them to their own good; to remove the
fears and fal&s;ities, which bad men had &s;pread, and
weak men had encouraged; and to excite in all
men a love for union, and a chearfulne&s;s for duty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubmit one more ca&s;e to you, re&s;pecting
your conque&s;t of this country, and then proceed
to new ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e our armies in every part of the conti|nent
immediately to di&s;per&s;e, every man to his
home, or where el&s;e he might be &s;afe, and engage
to re-a&s;&s;emble again on a certain future day. It
is clear that you would then have no army to con|tend
with; yet you would be as much at a lo&s;s as
you are now: you would be afraid to &s;end your
troops in parties over the continent, either to di&s;|arm,
or prevent us from a&s;&s;embling, le&s;t they &s;hould
not return: and while you kept them together,
<PB N="53" REF="55">
having no army of ours to di&s;pute with, you could
not call it a conque&s;t. You might furni&s;h out a
pompous page in the London Gazette, or the New
York paper: but when we returned at the appointed
time, you would have the &s;ame work to do you had
at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been the folly of Britain to &s;uppo&s;e her|&s;elf
more powerful than &s;he really is, and by that
means have arrogated to her&s;elf a rank in the
world &s;he is not entitled to: for more than this
century pa&s;t &s;he has not been able to carry on a
war without foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In Marlborough's
campaigns, and from that day to this, the number
of German troops and officers a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, have
been about equal with her own. Ten thou&s;and
He&s;&s;ians were &s;ent to England la&s;t war, to protect
her from a French inva&s;ion: and &s;he would have
cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and We&s;t
Indian expeditions, had not America been lavi&s;h
of her men and money to help her along. The
only in&s;tance, in which &s;he was engaged &s;ingly,
that I can recollect, was again&s;t the rebellion in
Scotland in 1745 and 1746, and in that, out of
three battles, &s;he was twice beaten, till by thus re|ducing
their numbers (as we &s;hall yours), and tak|ing
a &s;upply &s;hip, that was coming to Scotland,
with clothes, arms, and money (as we have often
done), &s;he was at la&s;t enabled to defeat them.</P>
<P>England was never famous by land. Her of|ficers
<PB N="54" REF="56">
have generally been &s;u&s;pected of cowardice,
have more of the air of a dancing ma&s;ter than a
&s;oldier; and by the &s;ample we have taken pri&s;on|ers,
we begin to give the preference to our&s;elves.
Her &s;trength of late has laid in her extravagance:
but as her finances and her credit are now low, her
&s;inews in that line begin to fail fa&s;t. As a nation,
&s;he is the poore&s;t in Europe: for were the whole
kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to &s;ale,
like the e&s;tate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as
much as &s;he owes. Yet this thoughtle&s;s wretch
mu&s;t go to war, and with the avowed de&s;ign, too,
of making us bea&s;ts of burden, to &s;upport her in
riot and debauchery, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her afterwards in
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e nations who are now our be&s;t
friends. This ingratitude may &s;uit a tory, or the
unchri&s;tian peevi&s;hne&s;s of a fallen quaker, but none
el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is the unhappy temper of the Engli&s;h, to be
plea&s;ed with any war, right or wrong, be it but
&s;ucce&s;sful: but they &s;oon grow di&s;contented with
ill fortune: and it is an even chance, that they are
as clamourous for peace next &s;ummer, as the king
and his mini&s;ters were for war la&s;t winter. In this
natural view of things, your Lord&s;hip &s;tands in a
very ugly critical &s;ituation. Your whole charac|ter
is &s;taked upon your laurels: if they wither, you
wither with them. If they flouri&s;h, you cannot
live long to look at them: and at any rate, the
<PB N="55" REF="57">
black account hereafter is not far off. What
lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only ble&s;|&s;ings
in di&s;gui&s;e: and the &s;eeming advantages on
your &s;ide have turned out to our profit. Even
our lo&s;s of this city, as far as we can &s;ee, might
be a principal gain to us. The more &s;urface you
&s;pread over, the thinner you will be, and the ea&s;ier
wiped away: and our con&s;olation, under that ap|parent
di&s;a&s;ter, would be, that the e&s;tates of the
tories would be &s;ecurities for the repairs. In &s;hort,
there is no old ground we can fail upon, but &s;ome
new foundation ri&s;es again to &s;upport us. "We
have put, Sir, our hands to the plough&mdash;and cur&s;ed
be he that looketh back."</P>
<P>Your king, in his &s;peech to parliament, la&s;t
&s;pring, declared to them, that "he had no doubt
but the great force they had enabled him to &s;end
to America would effectually reduce the rebellious
colonies." It has not&mdash;neither can it. But it has
done ju&s;t enough to &s;ay the foundation of its own
next year's ruin. You are &s;en&s;ible that you left
England in a divided di&s;tracted &s;tate of politics, and,
by the command you had here, you became a prin|cipal
prop in the court party: their fortunes re&s;t
on yours: by a &s;ingle expre&s;s, you can fix their
value with the public, and the degree to which
their &s;pirits &s;hall ri&s;e or fall. They are in your
hands as &s;tock, and you have the &s;ecret of the al|ley
with you. Thus &s;ituated, and connected, you
<PB N="56" REF="58">
become the unintentional, mechanical in&s;trument
of your own and their overthrow. The king and his
mini&s;ters put conque&s;t out of doubt, and the credit
of both depended on the proof. To &s;upport them
in the interim, it was nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould
make the mo&s;t of every thing: and we can tell by
Hugh Gaine's New York paper, what the com|plexion
of the London Gazette is. With &s;uch a
li&s;t of victories, the nation cannot expect you will
a&s;k new &s;upplies; and to confe&s;s your want of them,
would give the lie to your triumphs, and impeach
the king and his mini&s;ters of trea&s;onable decep|tion.
If you make the nece&s;&s;ary demand at home,
your party &s;inks: if you make it not, you &s;ink
your&s;elf. To a&s;k it now, is too late, and to a&s;k it
before, was too &s;oon, and unle&s;s it arrive quickly,
will be of no u&s;e. In &s;hort, the part you have to
act, cannot be acted: and I am fully per&s;uaded,
that all you have to tru&s;t to is, to do the be&s;t with
what force you have got, or little more. Though
we have greatly excelled you in point of general|&s;hip,
and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we
have not entered into the full &s;oul of enterprize:
for I, who know England, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the
people well, am confident, that it is ea&s;ier for us to
effect a revolution there, than you a conque&s;t here.
A few thou&s;and men, landed in England, with the
declared de&s;ign of depo&s;ing the pre&s;ent king&punc;
bringing his mini&s;ters to trial, and &s;etting up the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
Duke of Glouce&s;ter in his &s;tead, would a&s;&s;uredly
carry their point, while you were grovelling here
ignorant of the matter. As I &s;end all my papers
to England, this, like Common Sen&s;e, will find its
way there: and though it may put one party on
their guard, it will inform the other, and the nation
in general, of our de&s;ign to help them.</P>
<P>Thus far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you
a picture of pre&s;ent affairs: you may draw from it
what conclu&s;ion you plea&s;e. I wi&s;h as well to the
true po&s;terity of England as you can, but I con&s;i|der
independence as America's natural right and
intere&s;t, and never could &s;ee any real di&s;&s;ervice it
would be to Britain. If an Engli&s;h merchant re|ceives
an order, and is paid for it, it &s;ignifies no|thing
to him who governs the country. This is
my creed of politics. If I have any where ex|pre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf over warmly, it is from a fixt im|moveable
hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel
men and cruel mea&s;ures. I have likewi&s;e an aver|&s;ion
to monarchy, as being too deba&s;ing to the
dignity of man; but I never troubled others with
my notions till very lately, nor ever publi&s;hed a
&s;yllable in England in my life. What I write is
pure nature, and my pen and my &s;oul have ever
gone together. My writings I have always given
away, re&s;erving only the expence of printing and
paper, and &s;ometimes not even that. I have ne|ver
courted either fame or intere&s;t, and my man|ner
<PB N="58" REF="60">
of life, to tho&s;e who know it, will ju&s;tify what
I &s;ay. My &s;tudy is, to be u&s;eful, and if your
Lord&s;hip love mankind as well as I do, you would,
&s;eeing you cannot conquer us, ca&s;t about and lend
your hand towards accompli&s;hing a peace. Our
independence, with God's ble&s;&s;ing, we will main|tain
again&s;t all the world: but as we wi&s;h to avoid
evil our&s;elves, we wi&s;h not to inflict it on others.
I am never over inqui&s;itive into the &s;ecrets of the
cabinet, but I have &s;ome notion, if you neglect
the pre&s;ent opportunity, that it will not be in our
power to make a &s;eparate peace with you after|wards;
for whatever treaties or alliances we form,
we &s;hall mo&s;t faithfully abide by: wherefore you
may be deceived, if you think you can make it
with us at any time. A la&s;ting independent peace
is my wi&s;h, end, and aim; and to accompli&s;h that,
"I pray God the Americans may never be de|feated,
and I tru&s;t while they have good officers,
and are well commanded, and willing to be com|manded,
that they never will."</P>

<HEAD>AMERICAN CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of politics, as in the common
occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget
the ground we have travelled over, but frequently
neglect to gather up experience as we go. We
expend, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the knowledge of every
day on the circum&s;tances that produce it, and
journey on in &s;earch of new matter and new re|finements:
but as it is plea&s;ant, and &s;ometimes
u&s;eful, to look back, even to the fir&s;t periods of
infancy, and trace the turns and windings through
which we have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o we may likewi&s;e derive
many advantages by halting a while in our politi|cal
career, and taking a review of the wonderous
complicated labyrinth of little more than ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P>Truly, may we &s;ay, that never did man grow old
in &s;o &s;hort a time! We have crowded the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of an age into the compa&s;s of a few months,
and have been driven through &s;uch a rapid &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of things, that, for the want of lei&s;ure to
think, we unavoidably wa&s;ted knowledge as we
<PB N="60" REF="62">
came, and have left nearly as much behind us as
we brought with us: but the road is yet rich with
fragments, and, before we fully lo&s;e &s;ight of them,
will repay us for the trouble of &s;topping to pick
them up.</P>
<P>Were a man to be totally deprived of memory,
he would be incapable of forming any ju&s;t opinion;
every thing about him would &s;eem a chaos; he
would even have his own hi&s;tory to a&s;k from every
one; and by not knowing how the world went on
in his ab&s;ence, he would be at a lo&s;s to know how
it OUGHT to go on when he recovered, or rather
returned to it again. In like manner, though in a
le&s;s degree, a too great inattention to pa&s;t occur|rences
retards and bewilders our judgment in
every thing; while, on the contrary, by comparing
what is pa&s;t with what is pre&s;ent, we frequently
hit on the true character of both, and become wi&s;e
with very little trouble. It is a kind of counter|march,
by which we get into the rear of Time, and
mark the movements and meaning of things as we
make our return. There are certain circum&s;tances,
which, at the time of their happening, are kind of
riddles; and as every riddle is to be followed by
its an&s;wer, &s;o tho&s;e kind of circum&s;tances will be
followed by their events, and tho&s;e events are al|ways
the true &s;olution. A con&s;iderable &s;pace of
time may lap&s;e between, and unle&s;s we continue
our ob&s;ervations from the one to the other, the
<PB N="61" REF="63">
harmony of them will pa&s;s away unnoticed: but
the misfortune is, that partly from the pre&s;&s;ing ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of &s;ome in&s;tant things, and partly from the
impatience of our tempers, we are frequently in
&s;uch a hurry to make out the meaning of every
thing as fa&s;t as it happens, that we thereby never
truly under&s;tand it; and not only &s;tart new diffi|culties
to our&s;elves by &s;o doing, but, as it were,
embarra&s;s Providence in her good de&s;igns.</P>
<P>I have been civil in &s;tating this fault on a large
&s;cale; for, as it now &s;tands, it does not appear to
be levelled again&s;t any particular &s;et of men; but
were it to be refined a little further, it might after|wards
be applied to the Tories with a degree of
&s;triking propriety: tho&s;e men have been remark|able
for drawing &s;udden conclu&s;ions from &s;ingle
facts. The lea&s;t apparent mi&s;hap on our &s;ide, or
the lea&s;t &s;eeming advantage on the part of the ene|my,
have determined the fate of a whole cam|paign.
By this ha&s;ty judgment they have con|verted
a retreat into a defeat; mi&s;took general&s;hip
for error: while every little advantage purpo&s;ely
given the enemy, either to weaken their &s;trength
by dividing it, embarra&s;s their councils by multi|plying
their objects, or to &s;ecure a greater po&s;t
by the &s;urrender of a le&s;s, has been in&s;tantly mag|nified
into a conque&s;t. Thus, by quartering ill
policy upon ill principles, they have frequently
<PB N="62" REF="64">
promoted the cau&s;e they de&s;igned to injure, and
injured that which they intended to promote.</P>
<P>It is probable the campaign may open before
this number comes from the pre&s;s. The enemy
have long lain idle, and amu&s;ed them&s;elves with
carrying on the war by proclamations only. While
they continue their delay, our &s;trength increa&s;es:
and were they to move to action now, it is a cir|cum&s;tantial
proof they have no reinforcement com|ing;
wherefore, in either ca&s;e, the comparative
advantage will be ours. Like a wounded di&s;a|bled
whale they want only time and room to die in;
and though in the agony of their exit, it may be
un&s;afe to live within the flapping of their tail, yet
every hour &s;hortens their date, and le&s;&s;ens their
power of mi&s;chief. If any thing happens while
this Number is in the pre&s;s, it will afford me a
&s;ubject for the la&s;t pages of it. At pre&s;ent I am
tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor
the &s;tate of politics, have YET produced any thing
new, I am thereby left in the field of general
matter undirected by any &s;triking or particular
object. This Cri&s;is, therefore, will be made up
rather of variety than novelty, and con&s;i&s;t more of
things u&s;eful than things wonderful.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the cau&s;e, the union of the peo|ple,
and the means of &s;upporting and &s;ecuring both,
are points which cannot be too much attended to.
He who doubts of the former is a de&s;ponding cow|ard,
<PB N="63" REF="65">
and he who wilfully di&s;turbs the latter is a
traitor. Their characters are ea&s;ily fixed, and
under the&s;e &s;hort de&s;criptions I leave them for the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t degrees of &s;entimental uni|on
which America ever knew, was in denying the
right of the Briti&s;h Parliament "TO BIND THE
COLONIES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." The
declaration is in its form an almighty one, and
is the loftie&s;t &s;tretch of arbitrary power that ever
one &s;et of men, or one country claimed over ano|ther.
Taxation was nothing more than putting the
declared right into practice; and this failing, re|cour&s;e
was had to arms, as a means to e&s;tabli&s;h
both the right and the practice, or to an&s;wer a
wor&s;e purpo&s;e, which will be mentioned in the
cour&s;e of this Number. And in order to repay
them&s;elves the expence of an army, and to profit
by their own inju&s;tice, the Colonies were, by ano|ther
law, declared to be in a &s;tate of actual rebel|lion,
and of con&s;equence all property therein
would fall to the conquerors.</P>
<P>The Colonies, on their part, fir&s;t, denied the
right; &s;econdly, they &s;u&s;pended the u&s;e of taxable
articles, and petitioned again&s;t the practice of tax|ation:
and the&s;e failing, they, thirdly, defended
their property by force, as &s;oon as it was forcibly
invaded; and in an&s;wer to the declaration of re|bellion
and non-protection, publi&s;hed their decla|ration
<PB N="64" REF="66">
of Independence, and right to &s;elf-protec|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e, in a few words, are the different &s;tages
of the quarrel; and the parts are &s;o intimately and
nece&s;&s;arily connected with each other, as to admit
of no &s;eparation. A per&s;on, to u&s;e a trite phra&s;e,
mu&s;t be a Whig or a Tory in the lump. His feel|ings,
as a man, may be wounded; his charity, as a
Chri&s;tian, may be moved: but his political prin|ciples
mu&s;t go through all the ca&s;es on one &s;ide or
the other. He cannot be a Whig in <HI>this</HI> &s;tage, and
a Tory in <HI>that.</HI> If he &s;ays he is again&s;t the United
Independence of the Continent, he is, to all in|tents
and purpo&s;es again&s;t her in all the re&s;t; be|cau&s;e
THIS LAST comprehends the whole. And
he may ju&s;t as well &s;ay, that Britain was right in
declaring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right
in declaring her "RIGHT TO BIND THE COLO|NIES
IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." It &s;ignifies
nothing what neutral ground, of his own creation,
he may &s;kulk upon for &s;helter; for the quarrel in
no &s;tage of it hath afforded any &s;uch ground; and
either we or Britain are ab&s;olutely right or ab&s;o|lutely
wrong through the whole.</P>
<P>Britain, like a game&s;ter nearly ruined, hath now
put all her lo&s;&s;es into one bet, and is playing a
de&s;perate game for the total. If &s;he win it, &s;he
wins from me MY life; &s;he wins the Continent as
the forfeited property of rebels; the right of tax|ing
<PB N="65" REF="67">
tho&s;e that are left as reduced &s;ubjects; and the
power of binding them as &s;laves: And the &s;ingle die
which determines this unparalleled event is, whether
we &s;upport our independence or &s;he overturn it.
This is coming to the point at once. Here is the
touch-&s;tone to try men by. <HI>He that is not a &s;up|porter
of the independent &s;tates of America; in the
&s;ame degree that his religious and political principles
would &s;uffer him to &s;upport the government of any
other country, of which he called him&s;elf a &s;ubject,
is, in the American &s;en&s;e of the word,</HI> A TORY<HI>;
and thein&s;tant that he endeavors to bring his toryi&s;m
into practice, he becomes</HI> A TRAITOR. The
fir&s;t man can only be detected by a general te&s;t,
and the law hath already provided for the latter.</P>
<P>It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who
would root up our independence to have any &s;hare
in our legi&s;lation, either as electors or repre&s;enta|tives;
becau&s;e the &s;upport of our independence
re&s;ts in a great mea&s;ure on the vigour and purity of
our public bodies. Would Britain, even in time
of peace, much le&s;s in war, &s;uffer an election to be
carried by men who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves not to be
her &s;ubjects, or allow &s;uch to &s;it in parliament? Cer|tainly
not.</P>
<P>But there are a certain &s;pecies of tories with
whom con&s;cience or principle hath nothing to do,
and who are &s;o from avarice only. Some of the
fir&s;t fortunes in the continent, on the part of the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
whigs, are &s;taked on the i&s;&s;ue of our pre&s;ent mea|&s;ures.
And &s;hall di&s;affection only be rewarded with
&s;ecurity? Can any thing be a greater inducement
to a mi&s;erly man, than the hope of making his
mammon &s;afe? And though the &s;cheme be fraught
with every character of folly, yet, &s;o long as he
&s;uppo&s;es, that by doing nothing materially crimi|nal
again&s;t America on one part, and by expre&s;&s;ing
his private di&s;approbation again&s;t independence, as
a palliative with the enemy on the other part, he
&s;tands thereby in a &s;afe line between both, while, I
&s;ay, this ground be &s;uffered to remain, craft and
the &s;pirit of avarice will point it out, and men will
not be wanting to fill up this mo&s;t contemptible of
all characters.</P>
<P>The&s;e men, a&s;hamed to own the &s;ordid cau&s;e
from whence their di&s;affection &s;prings, and thereby
add meanne&s;s to meanne&s;s, by endeavouring to &s;hel|ter
them&s;elves under the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y; that is,
they had rather be thought to be tories from <HI>&s;ome
kind of principle,</HI> than tories by having <HI>no principle
at all.</HI> But till &s;uch time as they can &s;how &s;ome
real rea&s;on, natural, political or con&s;cientious, on
which their objections to independence are founded,
we are not obliged to give them credit for being
tories of the fir&s;t &s;tamp, but mu&s;t &s;et them down as
tories of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd number of the Cri&s;is I endeavoured
to &s;hew the impo&s;&s;ibility of the enemy making any
<PB N="67" REF="69">
conque&s;t of America that nothing was wanting on
our part but patience and per&s;everance, and that,
with the&s;e virtues, our &s;ucce&s;s, as far as human &s;pe|culation
could di&s;cern, &s;eemed as certain as fate.
But as there are many among us, who, influenced
by others, have regularly gone back from the prin|ciples
they once held, in proportion as we have gone
forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a
good man to live within the neighbourhood of di&s;|affected
ones; I &s;hall therefore, for the &s;ake of
confirming the one and recovering the other, en|deavour,
in the &s;pace of a page or two, to go over
&s;ome of the leading principles in &s;upport of inde|pendence.
It is a much plea&s;anter ta&s;k to pre|vent
vice than to puni&s;h it; and however our tem|pers
may be gratified by re&s;entment, or our nati|onal
expences ea&s;ed by forfeited e&s;tates, harmony
and friend&s;hip is neverthele&s;s the happie&s;t condition
a country can be ble&s;t with.</P>
<P>The principal arguments in &s;upport of indepen|dence
may be comprehended under the four fol|lowing
heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t,&mdash;The natural right of the continent to
independence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly,&mdash;Her intere&s;t in being independent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity,&mdash;and</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly,&mdash;The moral advantages ari&s;ing
therefrom.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="70">
I. The natural right of the continent to indepen|dence,
is a point which never yet was called in
que&s;tion. It will not even admit of a debate. To
deny &s;uch a right, would be a kind of athei&s;m
again&s;t nature: And the be&s;t an&s;wer to fuch an ob|jection
would be, "<HI>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart,
there is no God.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">II. The intere&s;t of the continent in being inde|pendent
is a point as clearly right as the former.
America, by her own internal indu&s;tty, and un|known
to all the powers of Europe, was at the be|ginning
of the di&s;pute, arrived at a pitch of great|ne&s;s,
trade and population, beyond which it was the
intere&s;t of Britain not to &s;uffer her to pa&s;s, le&s;t &s;he
&s;hould grow too powerful to be kept &s;ubordinate.
She began to view this country with the &s;ame un|ea&s;y
malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian
would view his ward who&s;e e&s;tate he had been en|riching
him&s;elf by for twenty years, and &s;aw him
ju&s;t arriving to manhood. And America owes no
more to Britain for her pre&s;ent maturity, than the
ward would to his guardian for being twenty-one
years of age. That America hath flouri&s;hed <HI>at the
time</HI> &s;he was under the government of Britain, is
true; but there is every natural rea&s;on to believe,
that had &s;he been an independent country from the
fir&s;t &s;ettlement thereof, uncontrouled by any foreign
power, free to make her own laws, regulate and
encourage her own commerce, &s;he had by his
<PB N="69" REF="71">
time been of much greater worth than now. The
ca&s;e is &s;imply this, The fir&s;t &s;ettlers in the different
colonies were left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, unnoticed
and un&s;upported by any European government;
but as the tyranny and per&s;ecution of the old world
daily drove numbers to the new, and, as by the fa|vor
of Heaven on their indu&s;try and per&s;everance,
they grew into importance, &s;o, in a like degree,
they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes
of Europe. It was impo&s;&s;ible in this &s;tate of in|fancy,
however thriving and promi&s;ing, that they
could re&s;i&s;t the power of any armed invader that
&s;hould &s;eek to bring them under his authority. In
this &s;ituation Britain thought it worth her while to
claim them, and the continent received and ac|knowledged
the claimer. It was, in reality, of no
very great importance who was her ma&s;ter, &s;eeing
that from the force and ambition of the different
powers of Europe &s;he mu&s;t, till &s;he acquired
&s;trength enough to a&s;&s;ert her own right, acknow|ledge
&s;ome one. As well, perhaps, Britain as ano|ther;
and it might have been as well to have been
under the &s;tates of Holland as any. The &s;ame hopes
of engro&s;&s;ing and profiting by her trade, by not
oppre&s;&s;ing it too much, would have operated
alike with any ma&s;ter, and produced to the colo|nies
the &s;ame effects. The clamour of protection
likewi&s;e, was all a farce; becau&s;e, in order to make
<HI>that</HI> protection nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he mu&s;t fir&s;t, by her own
<PB N="70" REF="72">
quarrels create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!</P>
<P>To know whether it be the intere&s;t of the con|tinent
to be independent, we need only a&s;k this
ea&s;y, &s;imple que&s;tion: Is it the intere&s;t of a man
to be a boy all his life? The an&s;wer to one will be
the an&s;wer to both. America hath been one con|tinued
&s;cene of legi&s;lative contention from the fir&s;t
king's repre&s;entative to the la&s;t; and this was una|voidably
founded in the natural oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t
between the old country and the new. A governor
&s;ent from England, or receiving his authority there|from,
ought never to have been con&s;idered in any
other light than that of a genteel commi&s;&s;ioned &s;py,
who&s;e private bu&s;ine&s;s was information, and his
public bu&s;ine&s;s a kind of civilized oppre&s;&s;ion. In
the fir&s;t of the&s;e characters he was to watch the tem|pers,
&s;entiments and di&s;po&s;ition of the people, the
growth of trade, and the increa&s;e of private for|tunes;
and in the latter, to &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch acts of
the a&s;&s;emblies, however beneficial to the people,
which did not directly or indirectly throw &s;ome in|crea&s;e
of power or profit into the hands of tho&s;e
who &s;ent him.</P>
<P>America, till now, could never be called a <HI>free
country,</HI> becau&s;e her legi&s;lation depended on the
will of a man three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant, who&s;e
intere&s;t was in oppo&s;ition to ours, and who by a
&s;ingle "no," could forbid what law he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The freedom of trade, likewi&s;e, is, to a trading
<PB N="71" REF="73">
country, an article of &s;uch va&s;t importance, that
the principal &s;ource of wealth depends upon it; and
it is impo&s;&s;ible that any country can flouri&s;h, as it
otherwi&s;e might do, who&s;e commerce is engro&s;&s;ed
cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of
another&mdash;yet the&s;e evils, and more than I can here
enumerate, the continent has &s;uffered by being un|der
the government of Great Britain. By an inde|pendence
we clear the whole at once&mdash;put an end
to the bu&s;ine&s;s of unan&s;wered petitions and fruitle&s;s
remon&s;trances&mdash;exchange Britain for Europe&mdash;
&s;hake hands with the world&mdash;live at peace with
mankind&mdash;and trade to any market where we be&s;t
can buy and &s;ell.</P>
<P N="3">III. The nece&s;&s;ity, likewi&s;e, of being independ|ent,
even before it was declared, became &s;o evident
and important, that the continent ran the ri&s;k of be|ing
ruined every day &s;he delayed it. There were
rea&s;ons to believe that Britain would endeavour to
make an European matter of it, and rather than lo&s;e
the whole, would di&s;member it like Poland, and
di&s;po&s;e of her &s;everal claims to the highe&s;t bidder.
Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Cor&s;ica,
made a &s;ale of it to the French, and &s;uch traffics
have been common in the old world. We had at
that time no Amba&s;&s;ador in any part of Europe, to
counteract her negociations, and by that means &s;he
had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted
on our part. We even knew nothing of the treaty
<PB N="72" REF="74">
for the He&s;&s;ians till it was concluded, and the troops
ready to embark. Had we been independent be|fore,
we had probably prevented her obtaining them.
We had no credit abroad, becau&s;e of our rebellious
dependency. Our &s;hips could claim no protection
in foreign ports, becau&s;e we afforded them no ju&s;ti|fiable
rea&s;on for granting it to us. The calling
our&s;elves &s;ubjects, and at the &s;ame time fighting
again&s;t the power we acknowledged, was a danger|ous
precedent to all Europe. If the grievances
ju&s;tified our taking up arms, they ju&s;tified our &s;e|paration;
if they did not ju&s;tify our &s;eparation,
neither could they ju&s;tify our taking up arms. All
Europe was intere&s;ted in reducing us as rebels, and
all Europe (or the greate&s;t part at lea&s;t) is intere&s;ted
in &s;upporting us as independent &s;tates. At home
our condition was &s;till wor&s;e: Our currency had
no foundation. and the fall of it would have ruined
whig and tory alike. We had no other law than a
kind of moderated pa&s;&s;ion; no other civil power
than an hone&s;t mob; and no other protection than
the temporary attachment of one man to another.
Had independence been delayed a few months lon|ger,
this continent would have been plunged into
irrecoverable confu&s;ion: Some violent for it, &s;ome
again&s;t it, till in the general cabal the rich would
have been ruined, and the poor de&s;troyed. It is
to independence that every tory owes the pre&s;ent
&s;afety he lives in; for by <HI>that,</HI> and <HI>that only,</HI> we
<PB N="73" REF="75">
emerged from a &s;tate of dangerous &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and
became a regular people.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity likewi&s;e of being independent, had
there been no rupture between Britain and America,
would in a little time have brought one on. The
encrea&s;ing importance of commerce, the weight
and perplexity of legi&s;lation, and the entangled &s;tate
of European politics, would daily have &s;hewn to
the continent the impo&s;&s;ibility of continuing &s;ubor|dinate;
for, after the coole&s;t reflections on the mat|ter,
this mu&s;t be allowed, that Britain was too jea|lous
of America, to govern it ju&s;tly; too ignorant
of it, to govern it well; and too di&s;tant from it, to
govern it at all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But, what weigh mo&s;t with all men of &s;e|rious
reflection are the MORAL ADVANTA|GES
ari&s;ing from independence: War and de&s;ola|tion
are become the trades of the old world; and
America neither could nor can be under the go|vernment
of Britain without becoming a &s;harer of
her guilt, and a partner in all the di&s;mal commerce
of death. The &s;pirit of duelling, extended on a
national &s;cale, is a proper character for European
wars. They have &s;eldom any other motive than
pride, or any other object than fame. The con|querors
and the conquered are generally ruined
alike, and the chief difference at la&s;t is, that the
one marches home with his honours, and the other
without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the
<PB N="74" REF="76">
Engli&s;h to fight for a feather, if they &s;uppo&s;e <HI>that
feather</HI> to be an affront; and America, without the
right of a&s;king why, mu&s;t have abetted in every
quarrel and abided by its fate. It is a &s;hocking
&s;ituation to live in, that one country mu&s;t be
brought into all the wars of another, whether the
mea&s;ure be right or wrong, or whether &s;he will or
not; yet this, in the fulle&s;t extent, was, and ever
would be, the unavoidable con&s;equence of the
connection. Surely! the Quakers forgot their
own principles, when in their late te&s;timony
they called <HI>this connection</HI> with the&s;e military and
mi&s;erable appendages hanging to it, "<HI>The happy
con&s;titution.</HI>"</P>
<P>Britain, for centuries pa&s;t has been nearly fifty
years out of every hundred at war with &s;ome power
or other. It certainly ought to be a con&s;cientious
as well as political con&s;ideration with America, not
to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe.
Our &s;ituation affords us a retreat from their cabals,
and the pre&s;ent happy union of the &s;tates bids fair
for extirpating the future u&s;e of arms from one
quarter of the world; yet &s;uch have been the irre|ligious
politics of the pre&s;ent leaders of the Quakers,
that, for the &s;ake of they &s;carce knew what, they
would cut off every hope of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing by ty|ing
this continent to Britain, like Hector to the
chariot-wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through
all the mi&s;eries of endle&s;s European wars.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
The connection, viewed from this ground, is di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing
to every man who has the feelings of hu|manity.
By having Britain for our ma&s;ter, we be|came
enemies to the greate&s;t part of Europe, and
they to us; and the con&s;equence was war inevitable.
By being our own ma&s;ters, independent of any fo|reign
one, we have Europe for our friends, and the
pro&s;pect of an endle&s;s peace among our&s;elves.
Tho&s;e who were advocates for the Briti&s;h govern|ment
over the&s;e colonies, were obliged to limit both
their arguments and their ideas to the period of an
European peace only: The moment Britain be|came
plunged in war, every &s;uppo&s;ed convenience
to us vani&s;hed away, and all we could hope for was
<HI>not to be ruined.</HI> Could this be a de&s;irable condi|tion
for a young country to be in?</P>
<P>Had the French pur&s;ued their fortune immedi|ately
after the defeat of Braddock, la&s;t war this city
and province had then experienced the woeful ca|lamities
of being a Briti&s;h &s;ubject. A &s;cene of the
&s;ame kind might happen again; for America, con|&s;idered
as a &s;ubject to the crown of Britain, would
ever have been the &s;eat of war and the bone of con|tention
between the two powers.</P>
<P>On the whole, if the future expul&s;ion of arms
from one quarter of the world be a de&s;irable object
to a peaceable man;&mdash;if the freedom of trade to
every part of it can engage the attention of a man
of bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;if the &s;upport or fall of millions of
<PB N="76" REF="78">
currency can affect our intere&s;t;&mdash;if the entire po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of e&s;tates, by cutting off the lordly claims of
Britain over the &s;oil, de&s;erves the regard of landed
property;&mdash;and if the right of making our own laws,
uncontrouled by royal or mini&s;terial &s;pies or man|dates,
be worthy our care as freemen;&mdash;then are
all men intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of independence;
and may he that &s;upports it not, be driven from the
ble&s;&s;ing, and live unpitied beneath the &s;ervile &s;uf|ferings
of &s;candalous &s;ubjection!</P>
<P>We have been amu&s;ed with the tales of ancient
wonders; we have read, and wept over, the hi&s;|tories
of other nations; applauded, cen&s;ured or pi|tied,
as their ca&s;es affected us.&mdash;The fortitude and
patience of the &s;ufferers&mdash;the ju&s;tne&s;s of their cau&s;e
&mdash;the weight of their oppre&s;&s;ions and oppre&s;&s;ors&mdash;
the object to be &s;aved or lo&s;t&mdash;with all the con&s;e|quences
of a defeat or a conque&s;t&mdash;have, in the
hour of &s;ympathy, bewitched our hearts and chained
it to their fate: But where is the power that ever
made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war
on which a world was &s;taked till now?</P>
<P>We may not, perhaps, be wi&s;e enough to make
all the advantages we ought of our independence;
but they are, neverthele&s;s, marked and pre&s;ented
to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD
and worthy the hand of Him who &s;ent them. I
look through the pre&s;ent trouble to a time of tran|quility,
when we &s;hall have it in our power to &s;et
<PB N="77" REF="79">
an example of peace to all the world. Were the
Quakers really impre&s;&s;ed and influenced by the quiet
principles they profe&s;s to hold, they would, how|ever
they might di&s;approve the means, be the fir&s;t
of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE,
becau&s;e, by &s;eparating from the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity, never given
to man before, of carrying their favourite principle
of peace into general practice, by e&s;tabli&s;hing go|vernments
that &s;hall hereafter exi&s;t without wars.
Oh ye fallen, cringing prie&s;t and Pemberton-rid|den
people! what more can we &s;ay of ye than that
a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a
political Quaker a real Je&s;uit.</P>
<P>Having thus gone over &s;ome of the principal
points in &s;upport of independence, I mu&s;t now re|que&s;t
the reader to return back with me to the pe|riod
when it fir&s;t began to be a public doctrine, and
to examine the progre&s;s it has made among the
various cla&s;&s;es of men. The aera I mean to begin
at, is the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, April 19th,
1775. Until this event happened, the continent
&s;eemed to view the di&s;pute as a kind of law-&s;uit for
a matter of right, litigating between the old coun|try
and the new; and &s;he felt the &s;ame kind and
degree of horror, as if &s;he had &s;een an oppre&s;&s;ive
plantiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the
court, while the cau&s;e was before it, and put the
judge, the jury, the defendant and his council to the
<PB N="78" REF="80">
&s;word. Perhaps a more heart-felt convul&s;ion ne|ver
reached a country with the &s;ame degree of pow|er
and rapidity before, and never may again. Pi|ty
for the &s;ufferers, mixed with indignation at the
violence, and heightened with apprehen&s;ions of un|dergoing
the &s;ame fate, made the affair of Lex|ington
the affair of the continent. Every part of it
felt the &s;hock and all vibrated together. A gener|al
promotion of &s;entiment took place: Tho&s;e who
had drank deeply into whiggi&s;h principles, that is,
the right and nece&s;&s;ity not only of oppo&s;ing, but
wholly &s;etting a&s;ide the power of the crown as &s;oon
as it became practically dangerous (for in theory it
was always &s;o) &s;tept into the fir&s;t &s;tage of indepen|dence;
while another cla&s;s of whigs, equally &s;ound
in principle, but not &s;o &s;anguine in enterprize, at|tached
them&s;elves the &s;tronger to the cau&s;e and fell
clo&s;e in with the rear of the former; their partition
was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men
who&s;e chief fault, <HI>at that time,</HI> aro&s;e from their en|tertaining
a better opinion of Britain than &s;he de|&s;erved,
convinced now of their mi&s;take, gave her
up and publicly declared them&s;elves good whigs.
While the tories, &s;eeing it was no longer a laughing
matter, either &s;unk into &s;ilent ob&s;curity, or con|tented
them&s;elves with coming forth and abu&s;ing
General Gage: Not a &s;ingle advocate appeared to
ju&s;tify the action of that day; it &s;eemed to appear
to every one with the &s;ame magnitude, &s;truck every
<PB N="79" REF="81">
one with the &s;ame force, and created in every one
the &s;ame abhorrence. From this period we may
date the growth of independence.</P>
<P>If the many circum&s;tances, which happened at
this memorable time, be taken in one view, and
compared with each other, they will ju&s;tify a con|clu&s;ion
which &s;eems not to be attended to, I mean
a fixt de&s;ign in the king and mini&s;try of driving
America into arms, in order that they might be
furni&s;hed with a pretence for &s;eizing the whole con|tinent,
as the immediate property of the crown.
A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!</P>
<P>It ought to be remembered, that the fir&s;t peti|tion
from the congre&s;s was at this time unan&s;wered
on the part of the Briti&s;h king. That the motion
called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of Fe|bruary,
1775, arrived in America the latter end of
March. This motion was to be laid by the &s;everal
governors, then in being, before the a&s;&s;embly of
each province; and the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly before which
it was laid, was the a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania in
May following. This being a ju&s;t &s;tate of the ca&s;e,
I then a&s;k, why were ho&s;tilities commenced be|tween
the time of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;olve in the hou&s;e
of commons, of the 20th of February, and the
time of the a&s;&s;emblies meeting to deliberate upon
it? Degrading and infamous as that motion was,
there is, neverthele&s;s, rea&s;on to believe that the
king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would
<PB N="80" REF="82">
agree to it, and le&s;t they &s;hould, took effectual care
they &s;hould not, by provoking them with ho&s;tilities
in the interim. They had not the lea&s;t doubt at
that time of conquering America at one blow;
and what they expected to get by a conque&s;t being
infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to
get either by taxation or accommodation, they
&s;eemed determined to prevent even the po&s;&s;ibility
of hearing each other, le&s;t America &s;hould di&s;ad|point
their greedy hopes of the whole, by li&s;tening
even to their own terms. On the one hand they
refufed to hear the petition of the continent, and on
the other hand took effectual care the continent
&s;hould not hear them.</P>
<P>That the motion of the 20th of February and the
orders for commencing ho&s;tilities were both con|certed
by the &s;ame per&s;on or per&s;ons, and not the
latter by General Gage, as was fal&s;ely imagined at
fir&s;t, is evident from an extract of a letter of his to
admini&s;tration, read among other papers in the
hou&s;e of commons; in which he informs his ma&s;ters,
<HI>That though their idea of his di&s;arming certain coun|ties
was a right one, yet it required him to be ma&s;ter
of the country, in order to enable him to execute it.</HI>
This was prior to the commencement of ho&s;tilities
and con&s;equently before the motion of the 20th of
February could be deliberated on by the &s;everal
a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
Perhaps it may be a&s;ked, why was the motion
pa&s;t, if there was at the &s;ame time a plan to aggra|vate
the Americans not to li&s;ten to it? Lord North
a&s;&s;igned one rea&s;on him&s;elf, which was, <HI>a hope of
dividing them.</HI> This was publicly tempting them
to reject it; that if, in ca&s;e, the injury of arms
&s;hould fail of provoking them &s;ufficiently, the in|&s;ult
of &s;uch a declaration might fill it up. But by
pa&s;&s;ing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected
in America, it enabled them, in their wretched
idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the
colonies to foreign powers with every po&s;&s;ible mark
of di&s;obedience and rebellion. They had applied
to tho&s;e powers not to &s;upply the continent with
arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and it was nece&s;&s;ary they
&s;hould incen&s;e them again&s;t us by a&s;&s;igning on their
own part &s;ome &s;eeming reputable rea&s;on why.
By dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the
&s;tates, and likewi&s;e to perplex the adherents of
America in England. But the principal &s;cheme,
and that which has marked their character in every
part of their conduct, was a de&s;ign of precipitating
the colonies into a &s;tate which they might after|wards
deem rebellion, and under that pretence put
an end to all future complaints, petitions or re|mon&s;trances,
by &s;eizing the whole at once. They
had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut
them no longer; their prodigality required new
plunder, and through the Ea&s;t-India article TEA,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
they hoped to transfer their rapine from that quar|ter
of the world to this.&mdash;Every de&s;igned quarrel
has its pretence; and the &s;ame barbarian avarice
accompanied the plant to America, which ruined
the country which produced it.</P>
<P>That men never turn rogues without turning
fools, is a maxim, &s;ooner or later, univer&s;ally true.
The commencement of ho&s;tilities, being in the be|ginning
of April, was, of all times the wor&s;t cho|&s;en:
The congre&s;s were to meet the tenth of May
following, and the di&s;tre&s;s the continent felt at this
unparalleled outrage gave a &s;tability to that body,
which no other circum&s;tance could have done. It
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed too, all inferior debates, and bound them
together by a nece&s;&s;itous affection, without giving
them time to differ upon trifles. The &s;uffering
likewi&s;e, &s;oftened the whole body of the people in|to
a degree of pliability, which laid the principal
foundation-&s;tone of union, order and government;
and which, at any other time, might only have
fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unim|proved:
But providence, who be&s;t knows how to
time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favors,
cho&s;e this to be the time. And who dares di&s;|pute
it?</P>
<P>It did not &s;eem the di&s;po&s;ition of the people at
this cri&s;is to heap petition upon petition, while the
former remained unan&s;wered: The mea&s;ure, how|ever,
was carried in congre&s;s, and a &s;econd petition
<PB N="83" REF="85">
was &s;ent; of which I &s;hall only remark, that it was
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive even to a dangerous fault, becau&s;e the
prayer of it appealed &s;olely to, what it called, the
prerogative of the crown, while the matter in di&s;|pute
was confe&s;&s;ed to be con&s;titutional. But even
this petition, flattering as it was, was &s;till not &s;o
harmonious as the chink of ca&s;h, and con&s;equently
not &s;ufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his mini&s;|try.
From every circum&s;tance it is evident, that
it was the determination of the Briti&s;h court to have
nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully
and ab&s;olutely. They were certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and the
field of battle was to be the only place of treaty.
I am confident there are thou&s;ands and tens of thou|&s;ands
in America who wonder now they &s;hould
ever think otherwi&s;e; but the &s;in of that day was
the &s;in of civility, yet it operated again&s;t our pre|&s;ent
good in the &s;ame manner that a civil opinion
of the devil would again&s;t our future peace.</P>
<P>Independence was a doctrine &s;carce and rare even
towards the conclu&s;ion of the year &s;eventy-five:
All our politics had been founded on the hope or
expectation of making the matter up&mdash;a hope,
which, though general on the &s;ide of America, had
never entered the head or heart of the Briti&s;h court.
Their hope was conque&s;t and confi&s;cation. Good
Heavens! what volumes of thanks does America
owe to Britain! What infinite obligations to the
<PB N="84" REF="86">
tool, that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the
throne! Nothing but the &s;harpe&s;t effence of vil|lainy,
compounded with the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;tillation of
folly, could have produced a men&s;truum that
would have effected a &s;eparation. The congre&s;s
in &s;eventy-four admini&s;tered an abortive medicine
to independence, by prohibiting the importation of
goods, and the &s;ucceeding congre&s;s rendered the
do&s;e &s;till more dangerous by continuing it. Had
independence been a &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem with America
(as Britain has advanced) &s;he ought to have dou|bled
her importation, and prohibited in &s;ome degree
her exportation. And this &s;ingle circum&s;tance is
&s;ufficient to acquit America, before any jury of na|tions,
of having a continental plan of independence
in view: A charge, which had it been true, would
have been honourable, but is &s;o gro&s;sly fal&s;e, that
either the amazing ignorance, or the wilful di&s;hon|e&s;ty
of the Briti&s;h court, is effectually proved by
it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd petition, like the fir&s;t, produced no
an&s;wer: it was &s;carcely acknowledged to be recei|ved;
the Briti&s;h court were too determined in their
villany even to act it artfully, and in their rage for
conque&s;t, neglected the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubtilties for ob|taining
it. They might have divided, di&s;tracted,
and played a thou&s;and tricks with us, had they been
as cunning as they were cruel.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
This la&s;t indignity gave a new &s;pring to indepen|dence.
Tho&s;e who knew the &s;avage ob&s;tinacy of
the king and the jobbing gambling &s;pirit of the court
predicted the fate of the petition, as &s;oon as it was
&s;ent from America; for the men being known, their
mea&s;ures were ea&s;ily fore&s;een. As politicians, we
ought not &s;o much to ground our hope on the rea|&s;onablene&s;s
of the thing we a&s;k, as on the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s
of the per&s;on of whom we a&s;k it; Who
would expect di&s;cretion from a fool, candor from
a tyrant, or ju&s;tice from a villain?</P>
<P>As every pro&s;pect of accommodation &s;eemed
now to fail fa&s;t, men began to think &s;eriou&s;ly on the
matter; and their rea&s;on being thus &s;tript of the
fal&s;e hope which had long encompa&s;&s;ed it, became
approachable by fair debate; yet &s;till the bulk of
the people he&s;itated; they &s;tartled at the novelty
of independence, without once con&s;idering that our
getting into arms at fir&s;t was a more extraordinary
novelty, and that all other nations had gone through
the work of independence before us. They doubted,
likewi&s;e, the ability of the continent to &s;upport it,
without reflecting, that it required the &s;ame force
to obtain an accommodation by arms as an inde|pendence.
If the one was acquirable, the other was
the &s;ame; becau&s;e to accompli&s;h either, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that our &s;trength &s;hould be too great for
Britain to &s;ubdue; and it was too unrea&s;onable to
&s;uppo&s;e, that with the power of being ma&s;ters, we
<PB N="86" REF="88">
&s;hould &s;ubmit to be &s;ervants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this &s;tate of political &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the pamphlet <HI>Com|mon Sen&s;e,</HI> made its appearance, and the &s;ucce&s;s it met with does not become me to mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams were &s;everally &s;poken of as the &s;uppo&s;ed author: I had not, at that time, the plea&s;ure either of per&s;onally knowing or being known to the two la&s;t gentlemen. The favor of Dr. Franklin's friend&s;hip I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a &s;chool boy, to pick up a plea&s;ing natural hi&s;tory of virginia, and my inclination from that day of &s;eeing the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Atlantic never left me. In Octo|ber, &s;eventy-five, Dr. Franklin propo&s;ed giving me &s;uch materials as were in his hands, towards completing a hi&s;|tory of the pre&s;ent tran&s;actions, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of having the fir&s;t volume out the next &s;pring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Sen&s;e, and fini&s;hed near|ly the fir&s;t part; and as I &s;uppo&s;ed the Doctor's de&s;ign in getting out a hi&s;tory, was to open the new year with a new &s;y&s;tem. I expected to &s;urpri&s;e him with a production on that &s;ubject, much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the pre&s;s as fa&s;t as I conveniently could, and ent him the fir&s;t pamphlet that was printed off.</NOTE>. Their caution at
this time, was exceedingly mi&s;placed; for if they
were able to defend their property and maintain their
rights by arms, they con&s;equently were able to de|fend
and &s;upport their independence; and in pro|portion
as the&s;e men &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity and rightene&s;s
of the mea&s;ure, they hone&s;tly and openly declared
and adopted it, and the part they have acted &s;ince,
has done them honour, and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed their
characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar ad|vantage
with it, that the foremo&s;t point of the con|trary
ground may at any time be reached by the
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;udden exertion of a thought; and it frequently
happens in &s;entimental differences that &s;ome &s;triking
circum&s;tance, or &s;ome forcible rea&s;on, quickly
conceived, will effect in an in&s;tant what neither ar|gument
nor example could produce in an age.</P>
<P>I find it impo&s;&s;ible in the &s;mall compa&s;s I am
limited to, to trace out the progre&s;s which inde|pendence
has made on the minds of the different
cla&s;&s;es of men, and the &s;everal rea&s;ons by which
they were moved. With &s;ome, it was a pa&s;&s;ionate
abhorrence again&s;t the king of England and his mi|ni&s;try,
as a &s;et of &s;avages and brutes; and the&s;e men
governed by the agony of a wounded mind, were
for tru&s;ting every thing to hope and heaven, and
bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a
growing conviction that the &s;cheme of the Briti&s;h
court was to create, ferment and drive on a quar|rel
for the &s;ake of confi&s;cated plunder: Men of this
ca&s;t ripened into independence in proportion as the
evidence increa&s;ed. While a third cla&s;s concei|ved
it was the true intere&s;t of America, internally
and externally, to be her own ma&s;ter, gave their
&s;upport to independence, &s;tep by &s;tep, as they &s;aw
her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many, it
was a compound of all the&s;e rea&s;ons; while tho&s;e
who were too callous to be reached by either, re|mained,
and &s;till remain tories.</P>
<P>The legal nece&s;&s;ity of being independent, with
&s;everal collateral rea&s;ons, is pointed out in an ele|gant,
<PB N="88" REF="90">
ma&s;terly manner, in a charge to the grand
jury for the di&s;trict of Charle&s;town, by the Hon.
William Henry Drayton, E&s;q. chief ju&s;tice of
South-Carolina. This performance, and the ad|dre&s;s
of the convention of New-York, are pieces,
in my humble opinion, of the fir&s;t rank in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>The principal cau&s;es why independence has not
been &s;o univer&s;ally &s;upported as it ought, are fear
and indolence, and the cau&s;es why it has been op|po&s;ed,
are, <HI>avarice, downright villainy,</HI> and <HI>lu&s;t of
per&s;onal power.</HI> There is not &s;uch a being in Ame|rica,
as a tory from con&s;cience; &s;ome &s;ecret defect
or other is interwoven in the character of all tho&s;e,
be they men or women, who can look with pa|tience
on the brutality, luxury and debauchery of
the Briti&s;h court, and the violations of their army
here. A woman's virtue mu&s;t &s;it very lightly on
her, who can even hint a favourable &s;entiment in
their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race
of pro&s;titutes in New-York were tories; and the
&s;chemes for &s;upporting the tory cau&s;e, in this city,
for which &s;everal are now in gaol, and one hanged
were concerted and carried on in common baudy|hou&s;es,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e who kept them.</P>
<P>The connection between vice and meanne&s;s is a
fit object for &s;atire, but when the &s;atire is a fact, it
cuts with the irre&s;i&s;tible power of a diamond. If a
Quaker, in defence of his ju&s;t rights, his property,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
and the cha&s;tity of his hou&s;e, takes up a mu&s;ket,
he is expelled the meeting; but the pre&s;ent king
of England, who &s;educed and took into keeping a
&s;i&s;ter of their &s;ociety, is reverenced and &s;upported
with repeated te&s;timonies, while the friendly noo|dle
from whom &s;he was taken (and who is now in
this city) continues a drudge in the &s;ervice of his ri|vals,
as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature
called a king.</P>
<P>Our &s;upport and &s;ucce&s;s depend on &s;uch a varie|ty
of men and circum&s;tances, that every one, who
does but wi&s;h well, is of &s;ome u&s;e: There are men
who have a &s;trange auk wardne&s;s to arms, yet have
hearts to ri&s;k every &s;hilling in the cau&s;e, or in &s;up|port
of tho&s;e who have better talents for defending
it. Nature in the arrangement of mankind, has
fitted &s;ome for every &s;ervice in life: Were all &s;ol|diers,
all would &s;tarve and go naked, and were
none &s;oldiers, all would be &s;laves. As di&s;affection
to independence is the badge of a tory, &s;o affection
to it is the mark of a whig; and the different &s;er|vices
of the whigs down from tho&s;e who nobly con|tribute
every thing, to tho&s;e who have nothing to
render but their wi&s;hes, tend all to the &s;ame centre,
though with different degrees of merit and ability.
The larger we make the circle, the more we &s;hall
harmonize, and the &s;tronger we &s;hall be. All we
want to &s;hut out, is di&s;affection, and, that excluded,
we mu&s;t accept from each other &s;uch duties as we
<PB N="90" REF="92">
are be&s;t fitted to be&s;tow. A narrow &s;y&s;tem of po|litics,
like a narrow &s;y&s;tem of religion is calculated
only to &s;our the temper, and live at variance with
mankind.</P>
<P>All we want to know in America is &s;imply this,
who is for independence, and who is not? Tho&s;e
who are for it will &s;upport it, and the remainder
will undoubtedly &s;ee the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their pay|ing
the charges; while tho&s;e who oppo&s;e or &s;eek to
betray it mu&s;t expect the more rigid fate of the
gaol and the gibbet. There is a ba&s;tard kind of
genero&s;ity, which, by being extended to all men,
is as fatal to &s;ociety, on one hand, as the want of
true genero&s;ity is on the other. A lax manner of
admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, fal&s;ely termed moderation,
has a tendency both to di&s;pirit public virtue, and
promote the growth of public evils. Had the late
committee of &s;afety taken cognizance of the la&s;t te&s;|timony
of the Quakers, and proceeded again&s;t &s;uch
delinquents as were concerned therein, they had,
probably prevented the trea&s;onable plans which have
been concerted &s;ince. When one villain is &s;uffered
to e&s;cape, it encourages another to proceed, either
from a hope of e&s;caping likewi&s;e, or an apprehen|&s;ion
that we dare not puni&s;h. It has been a matter
of general &s;urpri&s;e, that no notice was taken of the
incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th
of November la&s;t; a publication evidently intended
to promote &s;edition and trea&s;on, and encourage the
<PB N="91" REF="93">
enemy, who were then within a day's march of this
city, to proceed on and po&s;&s;e&s;s it. I here pre&s;ent
the reader with a memorial, which was laid before
the board of &s;afety a few days after the te&s;timony
appeared. Not a member of that board, that I
conver&s;ed with, but expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t dete&s;ta|tion
of the perverted principles and conduct of the
Quaker junto, and that the board would take the
matter up; notwith&s;tanding which, it was &s;uffered
to pa&s;s away unnoticed, to the encouragement of
new acts of trea&s;on, the general danger of the
cau&s;e, and the di&s;grace of the &s;tate.<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

citizens and fellow-&s;ubjects of one civil community;
and in this line of connection we hold out the right
hand of fellow&s;hip to all men. But we &s;hould con|ceive
our&s;elves to be unworthy members of the
FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES OF
AMERICA, were we unconcernedly to &s;ee or &s;uffer
any trea&s;onable wound, public or private, directly or
indirectly, to be given again&s;t the peace and &s;afety of
the &s;ame. We enquire not into the rank of the of|fenders,
nor their religious per&s;ua&s;ion; we have no
bu&s;ine&s;s with either, our part being only to find
them out, and exhibit them to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November,
and &s;igned "<HI>John Pemberton,</HI>" whom we &s;uppo&s;e
to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been di&s;|per&s;ed
abroad, a copy of which accompanies this.
Had the framers and publi&s;hers of that paper con|ceived
it their duty, to exhort the youth, and others,
of their &s;ociety, to a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under the
pre&s;ent trying vi&s;itations, and humbly to wait the
event of heaven towards them, they had therein
&s;hewn a Chri&s;tian temper, and we had been &s;ilent;
<PB N="93" REF="95">
but the anger and political virulence with which
their in&s;tructions are given, and the abu&s;e with
which they &s;tigmatize all ranks of men, not think|ing
like them&s;elves, leave no doubt on our minds
from what &s;pirit their publication proceeded: And
it is di&s;graceful to the pure cau&s;e of truth, that men
can dally with words of the mo&s;t &s;acred import, and
play them as mechanically off, as if religion con|&s;i&s;ted
only in contrivance. We know of no in&s;tance
in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear
arms, or do any thing which might &s;train their
con&s;cience; wherefore their advice, "to with&s;tand
and refu&s;e to admit to the arbitrary in&s;tructions and
ordinances of men," appear to us a fal&s;e alarm,
and could only be trea&s;onably calculated to gain fa|vour
with our enemies, when they were &s;eemingly
on the brink of invading this &s;tate, or what is &s;till
wor&s;e, to weaken the hands of our defence, that
their entrance into this city might be made practi|cal
and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>"We di&s;claim all tumult and di&s;order in the
puni&s;hment of offenders; and wi&s;h to be governed
not by temper but by rea&s;on, in the manner of treat|ing
them. We are &s;en&s;ible that our cau&s;e has &s;uf|fered
by the two following errors; fir&s;t, by ill|judged
lenity to traiterous per&s;ons in &s;ome ca&s;es;
and &s;econdly, by only a pa&s;&s;ionate treatment of
them in others. For the future we di&s;own both,
<PB N="94" REF="96">
and wi&s;h to be &s;teady in our proceedings, and &s;erious
in our puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>"Every &s;tate in America has by the repeated
voice of its inhabitants, directed and authorized the
continental congre&s;s to publi&s;h a formal declaration
of independence of, and &s;eparation from, the op|pre&s;&s;ive
king and parliament of great Britain; and
we look on every man an enemy who does not in
&s;ome line or other give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards &s;up|porting
the &s;ame; at the &s;ame time we con&s;ider the
offence to be heightened to a degree of unpar|donable
guilt, when &s;uch per&s;ons, under the &s;hew
of religion, endeavour, either by writing, &s;peaking,
or otherwi&s;e, to &s;ubvert, overturn, or bring re|proach
upon the independence of this continent, as
declared by congre&s;s.</P>
<P>"The publi&s;hers of the paper, &s;igned "John
Pemberton," have called in a loud and pa&s;&s;ionate
manner on their friends and connections, "to with|&s;tand
and refu&s;e" obedience to whatever "in&s;truc|tions
or ordinances" may be publi&s;hed, not war|ranted
by (what they call) "that happy con|&s;titution
under which they and others long
enjoyed tranquillity and peace." If this be
not trea&s;on, we know, not what may properly be
called by that name.</P>
<P>"To us it is a matter of &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
that men with the word "peace, peace"
continually on their lips, &s;hould be &s;o fond of living
<PB N="95" REF="97">
under, and &s;upporting a government, and at the
&s;ame time calling it "happy," which is never bet|ter
plea&s;ed than when at war&mdash;that hath filled In|dia
with carnage and famine&mdash;Africa with &s;lavery&mdash;
and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the
throats of the freemen of America. We conceive
it a di&s;grace to this &s;tate, to harbour or wink at &s;uch
palpable hypocri&s;y. But as we &s;eek not to hurt the
hair of any man's head, when we can make our|&s;elves
&s;afe without, we wi&s;h &s;uch per&s;ons to re&s;tore
peace to them&s;elves and us, by removing them&s;elves
to &s;ome part of the king of Great Britain's domi|nions,
as by that means they may live unmole&s;ted
by us, or we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that
tho&s;e who do not de&s;erve a place among us, ought
not to have one.</P>
<P>"We conclude, with reque&s;ting the council of
&s;afety to take into their con&s;ideration the paper
&s;igned "John Pemberton; and if it &s;hall appear to
them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a trea|&s;onable
nature, that they would commit the &s;igner,
together with &s;uch other per&s;ons as they can di&s;co|ver

&s;uch time as &s;ome mode of trial &s;hall a&s;certain the
full degree of their guilt and puni&s;hment; in the
doing of which, we wi&s;h their judges, whoever
they may be, to di&s;regard the man, his connections,
intere&s;t, riches, poverty, or principles of religion,
and to attend to the nature of his offence only."</P>

THE mo&s;t cavilling &s;ectarian cannot accu&s;e the
foregoing with containing the lea&s;t ingredient of
per&s;ecution. The free &s;pirit on which the Ameri|can
cau&s;e is founded, di&s;dains to mix with &s;uch an
impurity, and leave it a rubbi&s;h fit only for narrow
and &s;u&s;picious minds to grovel in: Su&s;picion and
per&s;ecution are weeds of the &s;ame dunghill, and
flouri&s;h be&s;t together. Had the Quakers minded
their religion and their bu&s;ine&s;s, they might have
lived through this di&s;pute in enviable ea&s;e, and
none would have mole&s;ted them. The common
phra&s;e with the&s;e people is, "<HI>Our principles are

are the rever&s;e</HI>; for never did the conduct of
men oppo&s;e their own doctrine more notoriou&s;ly
than the pre&s;ent race of the Quakers. They have
artfully changed them&s;elves into a different &s;ort of

like antiquated virgins they &s;ee not the havoc de|formity

and it is the principle of an <HI>unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI>
I would be for maintaining."</P>
<P>Can words be more expre&s;&s;ive than the&s;e.
Surely the tories will believe the tory lords! The
truth is, they <HI>do believe them,</HI> and know as fully as
any whig on the continent knows, that the king and
mini&s;try never had the lea&s;t de&s;ign of an accommo|dation
with America, but an ab&s;olute unconditional
conque&s;t. And the part which the tories were to
act, was, by downright lying, to endeavour to put
the continent off its guard, and to divide and &s;ow
di&s;content in the minds of &s;uch whigs as they might
gain an influence over. In &s;hort, to keep up a
di&s;traction here, that the force &s;ent from England
might be able to conquer in "<HI>one campaign.</HI>"
They and the mini&s;try were, by a dsifferent game,
playing into each others hands. The cry of the
tories in England was, "<HI>No reconciliation, no ac|commodation,</HI>"
in order to obtain the greater military
force; while tho&s;e in America were crying nothing
but "<HI>reconciliation and accommodation,</HI>" that the
force &s;ent might conquer with the le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But <HI>this</HI> "<HI>&s;ingle campaign</HI>" is over, and America
not conquered. The whole work is yet to do, and
the force much le&s;s to do it with. Their condition
<PB N="100" REF="102">
is both de&s;picable and deplorable: Out of ca&s;h&mdash;out
of heart, and out of hope. A country furni&s;hed
with arms and ammunition, as America now is,
with three millions of inhabitants, and three thou|&s;and
miles di&s;tant from the neare&s;t enemy that can
approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the
face.</P>
<P>Howe appears to have two objects in view,
either to go up the North-river, or come to Phila|delphia.
By going up the North-river, he &s;ecures
a retreat for his army through Canada, but the &s;hips
mu&s;t return if they return at all, the &s;ame way they
went; and as our army would be in the rear, the
&s;afety of their pa&s;&s;age down is a doubtful matter.
By &s;uch a motion, he &s;huts him&s;elf from all &s;upplies
from Europe, but through Canada, and expo&s;es
his army and navy to the danger of peri&s;hing. The
idea of his cutting off the communication between
the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern &s;tates, by means of the
North-river, is merely vi&s;ionary. He cannot do it
by his &s;hipping; becau&s;e no &s;hip can lay long at
anchor in any river within reach of the &s;hore; a
&s;ingle gun would drive a fir&s;t rate from &s;uch a &s;ta|tion.
This was fully proved la&s;t October, at fort
Wa&s;hington and Lee, where one gun only, on each
&s;ide the river, obliged two frigates to cut and be
towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it
off by his army; becau&s;e the &s;everal po&s;ts they
<PB N="101" REF="103">
mu&s;t occupy, would divide them almo&s;t to nothing,
and expo&s;e them to be picked up by ours like peb|bles
on a river's bank; but admitting he could,
where is the injury? Becau&s;e while his whole
force is cantoned out, as centries over the water,
they will be very innocently employed, and the
moment they march into the country, the commu|nication
opens.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable object is Philadelphia, and
the rea&s;ons are many. Howe's bu&s;ine&s;s in Ame|rica
is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds
him&s;elf unable to the ta&s;k, he will employ his
&s;trength to di&s;tre&s;s women and weak minds, in or|der
to accompli&s;h through <HI>their</HI> fears, what he
cannot effect by his <HI>own</HI> force. His coming, or
attempting to come to Philadelphia, is a circum|&s;tance
that proves his weakne&s;s: For no general,
that felt him&s;elf able to take the field and attack his
antagoni&s;t, would think of bringing his army into a
city in the &s;ummer time; and this mere &s;hifting
the &s;cene from place to place, without effecting any
thing, has feeblene&s;s and cowardice on the face of
it, and holds him up in a contemptible light to any
one who can rea&s;on ju&s;tly and firmly. By &s;everal
informations from New York, it appears that their
army in general, both officers and men, have given
up the expectation of conquering America; their
eye now is fixt upon the &s;poil. They &s;uppo&s;e Phi|ladelphia
<PB N="102" REF="104">
to be rich with &s;tores, and as they think
to get more by robbing a town, than by attacking
an army, their movement towards this city is pro|bable
We are not now contending again&s;t an
army of &s;oldiers, but again&s;t a band of thieves, who
had rather plunder than fight, and have no other
hope of conque&s;t than by cruelty.</P>
<P>They expect to get a mighty booty and &s;trike
another general panic by making a &s;udden move|ment
and getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this city, but un|le&s;s
they can march <HI>out</HI> as well as <HI>in,</HI> or get the
entire command of the river, to remove off their
plunder, they may probably be &s;topt with the &s;tolen
goods upon them. They have never yet &s;uc|ceeded
wherever they have been oppo&s;ed but at
fort Wa&s;hington. At Charle&s;ton their defeat was
effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In
every &s;kirmi&s;h at King&s;bridge and the White-Plains
they were obliged to retreat, and the in&s;tant
our arms were turned upon them in the Jer&s;eys,
they turned likewi&s;e, and tho&s;e that turned not
were taken.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of always fitting our internal police
to the circum&s;tances of the times we live in, is
&s;omething &s;o &s;trikingly obvious, that no &s;ufficient
objection can be made again&s;t it. The &s;afety of all
&s;ocieties depend upon it; and where this point is
not attended to, the con&s;equences will either be a
<PB N="103" REF="105">
general languor or a tumult. The encourage|ment
and protection of the good &s;ubjects of any
&s;tate, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and puni&s;hment of bad
ones, are the principal objects for which all au|thority
is in&s;tituted, and the line in which it ought
to operate. We have in this city a &s;trange variety
of men and characters, and the circum&s;tances of
the times require they &s;hould be publicly known;
it is not the number of tories that hurt us, &s;o much
as the not finding out who they are; men mu&s;t
now take one &s;ide or the other, and abide by the
con&s;equences: The quakers, tru&s;ting to their &s;hort|&s;ighted
&s;agacity, have, mo&s;t unluckily for them,
made their declaration in their la&s;t te&s;timony, and
we ought <HI>now</HI> to take them at their word. They
have voluntarily read them&s;elves out of the con|tinental
meeting, and cannot hope to be re&s;tored
to it again, but by payment and penitence. Men
who&s;e political principles are founded on avarice,
are beyond the reach of rea&s;on, and the only cure
of toryi&s;m of this ca&s;t, is to tax it. A &s;ub&s;tantial
good drawn from a real evil, is of the &s;ame benefit
to &s;ociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where
men have not public &s;pirit to render them&s;elves &s;er|viceable,
it ought to be the &s;tudy of government
to draw the be&s;t u&s;e po&s;&s;ible from their vices. When
the governing pa&s;&s;ion of any man or &s;et of men is
once known, the method of managing them is
<PB N="104" REF="106">
ea&s;y; for even mi&s;ers, whom no public virtue can
impre&s;s, would become generous, could a heavy
tax be laid upon covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tories have endeavoured to in&s;ure their pro|perty
with the enemy, by forfeiting their reputa|tion
with us; from which may be ju&s;tly inferred,
that their governing pa&s;&s;ion is avarice. Make them
as much afraid of lo&s;ing on one &s;ide as the other,
and you &s;tagger their toryi&s;m; make them more
&s;o, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to
wor&s;hip any power they are mo&s;t afraid of.</P>
<P>This method of con&s;idering men and things toge|ther,
opens into a large field for &s;peculation, and
affords me opportunity of offering &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions
on the &s;tate of our currency, &s;o as to make the
&s;upport of it go hand in hand with the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion
of di&s;affection, and the encouragement of public
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>The thing which fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf in in&s;pecting
the &s;tate of the currency is, that we have too much
of it, and that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of reducing the
quantity, in order to increa&s;e the value. Men are
daily growing poor by the very means they take to
get rich, for in the &s;ame proportion that the prices
of all goods on hand are rai&s;ed, the value of all mo|ney
laid by, is reduced. A &s;imple ca&s;e will make
this clear: Let a man have one hundred pounds
ca&s;h, and as many goods on hand as will to-day &s;ell
<PB N="105" REF="107">
for 20l. but not content with the pre&s;ent market
price, he rai&s;es them to 40, and by &s;o doing, obli|ges
others in their own defence to rai&s;e cent per
cent likewi&s;e; in this ca&s;e, it is evident that his hun|dred
pounds laid by is reduced fifty pounds in va|lue;
whereas, had the markets dropt cent per cent,
his goods would have &s;old but for ten, but his hun|dren
pounds would have ri&s;en in value to two hun|dred;
becau&s;e it would then purcha&s;e as many goods
again, or &s;upport his family as long again as before.
And &s;trange as it may &s;eem, he is one hundred and
fifty pounds the poorer for rai&s;ing his goods, to
what he would have been had he lowered them;
becau&s;e the forty pounds his goods &s;old for, is by
the general ri&s;e of the markets, cent per cent, ren|dered
of no more value than the ten pounds would
be, had the market fallen in the &s;ame proportion:
and con&s;equently the whole difference of gain or lo&s;s
is on the different values of the hundred pounds
laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage
for rai&s;ing goods is, for &s;everal rea&s;ons, much more
the fault of the tories than the whigs; and yet the
tories (to their &s;hame and confu&s;ion ought they to
be told of it) are by far the mo&s;t noi&s;y and di&s;con|tented.
The greate&s;t part of the whigs, by being
now either in the army, or employed in &s;ome pub|lic
&s;ervice, are <HI>buyers</HI> only, and not <HI>&s;ellers</HI>; and as
<PB N="106" REF="108">
this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged
on tho&s;e who are out of it.</P>
<P>But the grievance is now become too general to
be remedied by partial methods, and the only effec|tual
cure is to reduce the quantity of money; with
half the quantity we &s;hould be richer than we are
now, becau&s;e the value of it would be doubled, and
con&s;equently our attachment to it increa&s;ed; for it
is not the number of dollars a man has, but how far
they will go, that makes him either rich or poor.</P>
<P>The&s;e two points being admitted, viz. that the
quantity of money is too great, and that the prices
of goods can be only effectually reduced by redu|cing
the quantity of the money; the next point to be
con&s;idered is, the method how to reduce it?</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the times, as before ob|&s;erved,
require that the public characters of all men
&s;hould <HI>now</HI> be fully under&s;tood, and the only gene|ral
method of a&s;certaining it, is by an oath or affir|mation,
renouncing all allegiance to the king of
Great Britain, and to &s;upport the independency of
the United States, as declared by Congre&s;s. Let,
at the &s;ame time, a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty per
cent per annum, to be collected quarterly, be levied
on all property. The&s;e alternatives, by being per|fectly
voluntary, will take in all &s;orts of people.
Here is the te&s;t; here is the tax. He who takes
the former, con&s;cientiou&s;ly proves his affection to
<PB N="107" REF="109">
the cau&s;e, and binds him&s;elf to pay his quota by
the be&s;t <HI>&s;ervices</HI> in his power, and is thereby ju&s;tly
exempt from the latter; and tho&s;e who chu&s;e the
latter, pay their quota in money, to be excu&s;ed
from taking the former, or rather 'tis the price
paid to us for their &s;uppo&s;ed, though mi&s;taken
in&s;urance with the enemy.</P>
<P>But this is only a part of the advantage which
would ari&s;e by knowing the different characters of
men. The whigs &s;take every thing on the i&s;&s;ue of
their arms, while the tories, by their di&s;affection,
are &s;apping and undermining their &s;trength, and,
of con&s;equence, the property of the whigs is the
more expo&s;ed thereby; and whatever injury their
e&s;tates may &s;u&s;tain by the movements of the enemy,
mu&s;t either be borne by them&s;elves, who have done
every thing which has <HI>yet</HI> been done, or by the to|ries,
who have not only done nothing, but have, by

<P>In the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, we ought to know &s;quare by
&s;quare, and hou&s;e by hou&s;e, who are in real allegi|ance
with the United Independent States, and who
are not. Let but the line be made clear and di&s;|tinct,
and all men will then know what they are to
tru&s;t to. It would not only be good policy, but
&s;trict ju&s;tice, to rai&s;e fifty or a hundred thou&s;and

and property of the king of England's votaries, re&s;i|dent

in Philadelphia, to be di&s;tributed, as a reward
to tho&s;e inhabitants of the city and &s;tate, who &s;hould
turn out and repul&s;e the enemy, &s;hould they at|tempt
their march this way; and likewi&s;e, to bind
the property of all &s;uch per&s;ons to make good the
damages which that of the whigs might &s;u&s;tain. In
the undi&s;tingui&s;hable mode of conducting a war, we
frequently make repri&s;als at &s;ea, on the ve&s;&s;els of
per&s;ons in England who are friends to our cau&s;e,
compared with the re&s;identary tories among us.</P>
<P>In every former publication of mine, from Com|mon
&s;en&s;e down to the la&s;t Cri&s;is, I have generally
gone on the charitable &s;uppo&s;ition, that the tories
were rather a mi&s;taken than a criminal people, and
have applied argument after argument with all the
candor and temper I was capable of, in order to &s;et
every part of the ca&s;e clearly and fairly before them,
and if po&s;&s;ible, to reclaim them from ruin to rea|&s;on.
I have done my duty by them, and have
now done with that doctrine, taking it for granted,
that tho&s;e who yet hold their di&s;affection, are either
a &s;et of avaricious mi&s;creants, who would &s;acrifice
the continent to &s;ave them&s;elves, or a banditti of
hungry traitors, who are hoping for a divi&s;ion of the
&s;poil. To which may be added, a li&s;t of crown
or proprietary dependants, who, rather than go
without a portion of power, would be content to
&s;hare it with the devil. Of &s;uch men there is no
<PB N="109" REF="111">
hope; and their obedience will only be according
to the danger that is &s;et before them, and the power
that is exerci&s;ed over them.</P>
<P>A time will &s;hortly arrive, in which by a&s;certain|ing
the characters of per&s;ons now, we &s;hall be
guarded again&s;t their mi&s;chiefs then; &s;o in pro|portion
as the enemy de&s;pair of conque&s;t, they
will be trying the arts of &s;eduction and the force
of fear, by all the mi&s;chiefs they can inflict. But in
war we may be certain of the&s;e two things, viz.
that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with
more than u&s;ual parade, are always &s;igns of weak|ne&s;s.
He that can conquer, finds his mind too free
and plea&s;ant to be bruti&s;h; and he that intends to
conquer, never makes too much &s;how of his
&s;trength.</P>
<P>We now know the enemy we have to do with.
While drunk with the certainty of victory, they
di&s;dained to be civil; and in proportion as di&s;ap|pointment
makes them &s;ober, and their apprehen|&s;ions
of an European war alarm them, they will be|come
cringing and artful; hone&s;t they cannot be.</P>
<P>But our an&s;wer to them, in either condition they
may be in, is &s;hort and full, "As free and inde|pendent
&s;tates, we are willing to make peace with
you to-morrow, but we can neither hear nor reply
in any other character."</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
If Britain cannot conquer us, it proves, that &s;he
is neither able to govern or protect us, and our par|ticular
&s;ituation now is &s;uch, that any connexion
with her would be unwi&s;ely exchanging a half de|feated

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Sept. 12, 1777.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who expect to reap the ble&s;&s;ings of
freedom, mu&s;t, like men, undergo the fatigues of
&s;upporting it. The event of Ye&s;terday is one of
tho&s;e kind of alarms which is ju&s;t &s;ufficient to rou&s;e
us to duty, without being of con&s;equence enough
to depre&s;s our fortitude. It is not a field of a few
acres of ground, but a cau&s;e we are defending, and
whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by
degrees, the con&s;equence will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Look back at the events of la&s;t winter and the
pre&s;ent year; there you will find that the enemy's
&s;ucce&s;&s;es have always contributed to reduce them.
What they have gained in ground, they paid &s;o
dearly for in numbers, that their victories have in
the end amounted to defeats. We have always
been ma&s;ters at the la&s;t pu&s;h, and always &s;hall, while
we do our duty. Howe has been once on the
banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven
back with lo&s;s and di&s;grace; and why not be again
driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and
<PB N="112" REF="114">
ours are very different. He has every body to
fight, we have only his <HI>one</HI> army to cope with,
and which wa&s;tes away at every engagement; we
can not only reinforce, but can redouble our num|bers;
he is cut off from all &s;upplies, and mu&s;t &s;ooner
or later inevitably fall into our hands.</P>
<P>Shall a band of ten or twelve thou&s;and robbers,
who are this day fifteen hundred or two thou&s;and
men le&s;s in &s;trength than they were ye&s;terday, con|quer
America, or &s;ubdue even a &s;ingle &s;tate? The
thing cannot be, unle&s;s we &s;it down and &s;uffer them
to do it. Another &s;uch a bru&s;h, notwith&s;tanding
we lo&s;t the ground, would, by &s;till reducing the
enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards
totally defeated.</P>
<P>Could our whole army have come up to the at|tack
at one time, the con&s;equences had probably
been otherwi&s;e; but our having different parts of
the Brandywine-creek to guard, and the uncertainty
which road to Philadelphia the enemy would at|tempt
to take, naturally afforded them an opportu|nity
of pa&s;&s;ing with their main body at a place
where only a part of ours could be po&s;ted; for it
mu&s;t &s;trike every thinking man with conviction,
that it requires a much greater force to oppo&s;e an
enemy in &s;everal places, than is &s;ufficient to defeat
in any one place.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
Men who are &s;incere in defending their freedom,
will always feel concern at every circum&s;tance
which &s;eems to make again&s;t them; it is the natural
and hone&s;t con&s;equence of all affectionate attach|ments,
and the want of it is a vice. But the de|jection
la&s;ts only for a moment; they &s;oon ri&s;e out
of it with additional vigour; the glow of hope,
courage and fortitude, will, in a little time &s;upply
the place of every inferior pa&s;&s;ion, and kindle the
whole heart into heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>There is a my&s;tery in the countenance of &s;ome
cau&s;es, which we have not always pre&s;ent judg|ment
enough to explain. It is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to &s;ee an
enemy advancing into a country, but it is the only
place in which we can beat them, and in which we
have always beaten them, whenever they made the
attempt. The nearer any di&s;ea&s;e approaches to
a cri&s;is, the nearer it is to a cure. Danger and de|liverance
make their advances together, and it is
only the la&s;t pu&s;h, that one or the other takes the
lead.</P>
<P>There are many men who will do their duty
when it is not wanted; but a genuine public &s;pirit
always appear mo&s;t, when there is mo&s;t occa&s;ion for
it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet
entire. The attack made by us ye&s;terday, was un|der
many di&s;advantages, naturally ari&s;ing from the
uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy
would take; and from that circum&s;tance, the whole
of our force could not be brought up together
<PB N="114" REF="116">
time enough to engage all at once. Our &s;trength
is yet re&s;erved; and it is evident that Howe does
not think him&s;elf a gainer by the affair, otherwi&s;e
he would this morning have moved down and at|tacked
General Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the city and country, it is in your
power, by a &s;pirited improvement of the pre&s;ent
circum&s;tance, to turn it to a real advantage. Howe
is now weaker than before, and every &s;hot will con|tribute
to reduce him. You are more immediately
intere&s;ted than any other part of the continent;
your all is at a &s;take; it is not &s;o with the general
cau&s;e; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder
and de&s;truction: It is the encouragement which
Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promi&s;ed his
army. Thus circum&s;tanced, you may &s;ave your|&s;elves
by a manly re&s;i&s;tance, but you can have no
hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our
brave general, or any part of the army, officers or
men, out of heart, and I have &s;een them in circum|&s;tances
a thou&s;and times more trying than the pre|&s;ent.
It is only tho&s;e that are not in action, that
feel languor and heavine&s;s, and the be&s;t way to rub
it off, is to turn out, and make &s;ure work of it.</P>
<P>Our army mu&s;t undoubtedly feel fatigue, and
want a reinforcement of re&s;t, though not of valour.
Our own intere&s;t and happine&s;s call upon us to give
them every &s;upport in our power, and make the
<PB N="115" REF="117">
burden of the day, on which the &s;afety of this city
depends, light as po&s;&s;ible. Remember, gentle|men,
that we have forces both to the northward
and &s;outhward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be
but &s;topt till tho&s;e can arrive, this city will be &s;aved,
and the enemy finally routed. You have too
much at &s;take to he&s;itate. You ought not to think
an hour on the matter, but to &s;pring to action at
once. Other &s;tates have been invaded, have like|wi&s;e
driven off the invaders. Now our time
and turn is come, and perhaps the fini&s;hing
&s;troke is re&s;erved for us. When we look back on
the dangers we have been &s;aved from, and reflect
on the &s;ucce&s;s we have been ble&s;&s;ed with, it would
be &s;inful either to be idle or de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this paper with a &s;hort addre&s;s to General
Howe. You, &s;ir, are only lingering out the period
that &s;hall bring with it your defeat. You have
yet &s;carce began upon the war, and the farther you
enter, the fa&s;ter will your troubles thicken. What
you now enjoy is only a re&s;pite from ruin; an in|vitation
to de&s;truction: &s;omething that will lead
on to our deliverance at your expence. We know
the cau&s;e we are engaged in, and though a pa&s;&s;ion|ate
fondne&s;s for it may make us grieve at every
injury that threatens it, yet, when the moment of
concern is over, the determination to duty returns.
We are not moved by the gloomy &s;mile of a worth|le&s;s
<PB N="116" REF="118">
king, but by the ardent glow of generous
patrioti&s;m. We fight not to en&s;lave, but to &s;et a
country free, and to make room upon the earth for
hone&s;t men to live in. In &s;uch a cau&s;e, we are
&s;ure we are right; and we leave to you, the de|&s;pairing
reflection of being the tool of a mi&s;erable

<HEAD>To General Sir William Howe.</HEAD>
<P>TO argue with a man who has renounced the
u&s;e and authority of rea&s;on, and who&s;e philo&s;ophy
con&s;i&s;ts in holding humanity in contempt, is like
admini&s;tering medicines to the dead, or endeavour|ing
to convert an athei&s;t by &s;cripture. Enjoy, &s;ir,
your in&s;en&s;ibility of feeling and reflecting. It is
the prerogative of animals. And no man will en|vy
you tho&s;e honours, in which a &s;avage only can
be your rival, and a bear your ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>As the genero&s;ity of this country, rewarded your
brother's &s;ervices la&s;t war with an elegant monu|ment
in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, it is con&s;i&s;tent that
&s;he &s;hould be&s;tow &s;ome mark of di&s;tinction upon
you. You certainly de&s;erve her notice, and a con|&s;picuous
place in the catalogue of extraordinary
per&s;ons. Yet it would be a pity to pa&s;s you from
the world in &s;tate, and con&s;ign you to magnificent
oblivion among the tombs, without telling the fu|ture
<PB N="118" REF="120">
beholder why. Judas is as much known as
John, yet hi&s;tory a&s;cribes their fame to very differ|ent
actions.</P>
<P>Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monu|ment:
But of what kind? or of what in&s;cription?
where placed? or how embelli&s;hed? is a que&s;tion
that would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's, in
the profounde&s;t mood of hi&s;torical deliberation.
We are at no lo&s;s, &s;ir, to a&s;certain your real charac|ter,
but &s;omewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its
identity, and pre&s;erve it uninjured from the tran&s;|formations
of time or mi&s;take. A &s;tatuary may
give a fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ion to your bu&s;t, or decorate
it with &s;ome equivocal emblems, by which you may
happen to &s;teal into reputation, and impo&s;e upon
the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature, or
ridicule may con&s;pire, or a variety of accidents com|bine
to le&s;&s;en, enlarge or change Sir William's
fame; and no doubt, but he who has taken &s;o much
pains to be &s;ingular in his conduct, would choo&s;e
to be as &s;ingular in his exit, his monument and his
epitaph.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual honours of the dead, to be &s;ure, are
not &s;ufficiently &s;ublime to e&s;cort a character like
you to the republic of du&s;t and a&s;hes; for however
men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or
government here, the grave is neverthele&s;s a per|fect
republic. Death is not the monarch of the
<PB N="119" REF="121">
dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains
a conque&s;t, he lo&s;es a &s;ubject, and, like the fooli&s;h
king you &s;erve, will, in the end, war him&s;elf out of
all dominion.</P>
<P>As a proper preliminary towards the arrange|ment
of your funeral honours, we readily admit
your new rank of <HI>knighthood.</HI> The title is perfectly
in character, and is your own, more by merit than
creation. There are knights of various orders
from the knight of the windmill, to the knight of
the po&s;t. The former is your patron for exploits,
and the latter will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in &s;ettling your accounts.
No honourary title could be more happily applied!
The ingenuity is &s;ublime! And your royal ma&s;ter
hath di&s;covered more genius in fitting you there|with,
than in generating the mo&s;t fini&s;hed figure
for a button, or de&s;canting on the properties of a
button mould.</P>
<P>But how, &s;ir, &s;hall we di&s;po&s;e of you? The
invention of a &s;tatuary is exhau&s;ted, and Sir Wil|liam
is yet unprovided with a monument. America
is anxious to be&s;tow her funeral favours upon you,
and wi&s;hes to do it in a manner that &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h
you from all the decea&s;ed heroes of the la&s;t war.
The <HI>Egyptian method of embalming</HI> is not known
to the pre&s;ent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry
hath out lived the &s;cience of decyphering it. Some
other method, therefore, mu&s;t be thought of to
<PB N="120" REF="122">
immortalize the new knight of the windmill and
po&s;t. Sir William, thanks to his &s;tars, is not op|pre&s;&s;ed
with very delicate ideas. He has no am|bition
of being wrapt up and handed about in
myrrh, aloes, and ca&s;&s;ia. Le&s;s chargeable odours
will &s;uffice; and it fortunately happens, that the
&s;imple genius of America, hath di&s;covered the art
of pre&s;erving bodies, and embelli&s;hing them too,
with much greater frugality than the ancients. In
a balmage, &s;ir, of humble tar, you will be as &s;ecure
as Pharoah, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival
in finery all the mummies of Egypt.</P>
<P>As you have already made your exit from the
moral world, and by numberle&s;s acts both of pa&s;|&s;ionate
and deliberate inju&s;tice engraved an "<HI>Here
Lyeth</HI>" on your decea&s;ed honour, it mu&s;t be mere
affectation in you to pretend concern at the hu|mours
or opinions of mankind re&s;pecting you.
What remains of you may expire at any time.
The &s;ooner the better. For he who &s;urvives his
reputation, lives out of &s;pite to him&s;elf like a man
li&s;tening to his own reproach.</P>
<P>Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to
the in&s;pection of the curious, and return to the
hi&s;tory of your yet &s;urviving actions.&mdash;The
character of Sir William hath undergone &s;ome ex|traordinary
revolutions &s;ince his arrival in America.
It is now fixed and known; and we have nothing
<PB N="121" REF="123">
to hope from your candour or to fear from your
capacity. Indolence and inability have too large
a &s;hare in your compo&s;ition ever to &s;uffer you to
be any thing more than the hero of little villanies
and unfini&s;hed adventures. That, which to &s;ome
per&s;ons appeared moderation in you at fir&s;t, was
not produced by any real virtue of your own, but
by a contra&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions dividing and holding you
in perpetual irre&s;olution. One vice will frequent|ly
expel another without the lea&s;t merit in the man,
as powers in contrary directions reduce each other
to re&s;t.</P>
<P>It became you to have &s;upported a dignified
&s;olemnity of character; to have &s;hewn a &s;uperior
liberality of &s;oul; to have won re&s;pect by an ob|&s;tinate
per&s;everance in maintaining order, and to
have exhibited on all occa&s;ions, &s;uch an unchange|able
graciou&s;ne&s;s of conduct, that while we beheld
in you the re&s;olution of an enemy, we might ad|mire
in you the &s;incerity of a man. You came to
America under the high &s;ounding titles of com|mander
and commi&s;&s;ioner; not only to &s;uppre&s;s
what you called rebellion by arms, but to &s;hame it
out of countenance by the excellence of your ex|ample.
In&s;tead of which, you have been the pa|tron
of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of
Indian cruelties, and have imported a cargo of
vices blacker than tho&s;e you pretend to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">
Mankind are not univer&s;ally agreed in their de|termination
of right and wrong; but there are cer|tain
actions which the con&s;ent of all nations and in|dividuals
hath branded with the unchangeable name
of MEANNESS. In the li&s;t of human vices we
find &s;ome of &s;uch a refined con&s;titution, that they
cannot be carried into practice without &s;educing
&s;ome virtue to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> hath
neither alliance nor apology. It is generated in
the du&s;t and &s;weepings of other vices, and is of
&s;uch a hateful figure that all the re&s;t con&s;pire to
di&s;own it. Sir William, the commi&s;&s;ioner of
George the Third, hath at la&s;t vouch&s;afed to give
it rank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive
at the council board, and dubbed it companion of
the order of knighthood.</P>
<P>The particular act of meanne&s;s which I allude to
in this de&s;cription, is forgery. You, &s;ir, have abet|ted
and patronized the forging and uttering counter|feit
continental bills. In the &s;ame New-York
new&s;papers in which your own proclamation under
your ma&s;ter's authority was publi&s;hed, offering, or
pretending to offer, pardon and protection to the
inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates, there were repeated ad|verti&s;ements
of counterfeit money for &s;ale, and
per&s;ons who have come officially from you and
under &s;anction of your flag, have been taken up in
attempting to put them off.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125">
A conduct &s;o ba&s;ely mean in a public character
is without precedent or pretence. Every nation on
earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in
de&s;pi&s;ing you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon &s;o|ciety
which nothing can excu&s;e or palliate&mdash;An
improvement upon beggarly villany&mdash;and &s;hews an
inbred wretchedne&s;s of heart made up between the
venomous malignity of a &s;erpent and the &s;piteful
imbecility of an inferior reptile.</P>
<P>The laws of any civilized country would con|demn
you to the gibbet without regard to your
rank or titles, becau&s;e it is an action foreign to the
u&s;age and cu&s;tom of war; and &s;hould you fall into
our hands, which pray God you may, it will be a
doubtful matter whether we are to con&s;ider you as
a military pri&s;oner or a pri&s;oner for felony.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is exceedingly unwi&s;e and impolitic in
you, or any per&s;ons in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, to pro|mote,
or even encourage, or wink, at the crime
of forgery in any ca&s;e whatever. Becau&s;e, as the
riches of England, as a nation, are chiefly in paper,
and the far greater part of trade among individuals
is carried on by the &s;ame medium, that is, by notes
and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all
people in the world ought to endeavour to keep
forgery out of &s;ight, and, if po&s;&s;ible, not to re|vive
the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men
familiar with a crime which they may afterwards
<PB N="124" REF="126">
practi&s;e to much greater advantage again&s;t tho&s;e
who fir&s;t taught them. Several officers in the
Engli&s;h army have made their exit at the gallows
for forgery on their agents; for we all know, who
know any thing of England, that there is not a
more nece&s;&s;itous body of men, taking them ge|nerally,
than what the Engli&s;h officers are. They
contrive to make a &s;hew at the expence of the
taylor, and appear clean at the charge of the
wa&s;her-woman.</P>
<P>England hath at this time nearly two hundred
million pounds &s;terling of public money in paper,
for which &s;he hath no real property, be&s;ides a large
circulation of bank notes, bank po&s;t bills, and
promi&s;&s;ory notes and drafts of private bankers,
merchants, and trade&s;men. She hath the greate&s;t
quantity of paper currency and the lea&s;t quantity of
gold and &s;ilver of any nation in Europe; the real
&s;pecie, which is about &s;ixteen millions &s;terling,
&s;erve only as change in large &s;ums, which are al|ways
made in paper, or for payment in &s;mall ones.
Thus circum&s;tanced, the nation is put to its wit's
end, and obliged to be &s;evere almo&s;t to criminality,
to prevent the practice and growth of forgery.
Scarcely a &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es at the Old Bailey, or an
execution at Tyburn, but witne&s;&s;eth this truth. Yet
you, &s;ir, regardle&s;s of the policy which her nece&s;|&s;ity
obliges her to adopt, have made your whole
<PB N="125" REF="127">
army intimate with the crime. And as all armies,
at the conclu&s;ion of a war, are too apt to carry into
practice the vices of the campaign, it will probably
happen, that England will hereafter abound in for|geries,
to which art, the practitioners were fir&s;t
initiated under your authority in America. You,
&s;ir, have the honour of adding a new vice to the
military catalogue; and the rea&s;on, perhaps, why
the invention was re&s;erved for you is, becau&s;e no
general before was mean enough even to think
of it.</P>
<P>That a man who&s;e &s;oul is ab&s;orbed in the low
traffic of vulgar vice, is incapable of moving in any
&s;uperior region, is clearly &s;hewn in you by the
event of every campaign. Your military exploits
have been without plan, object or deci&s;ion. Can
it be po&s;&s;ible that you or your employers can &s;up|po&s;e
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia to be any ways
equal to the expence or expectation of the nation
which &s;upports you? What advantages does En|gland
derive from any achievements of yours? To
<HI>her</HI> it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in,
&s;o long as the bu&s;ine&s;s of conque&s;t is unperformed,
and the charge of maintaining you remains the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>If the principal events of the three campaigns be
attended to, the balance will appear &s;trongly again&s;t
you at the clo&s;e of each; but the la&s;t, in point of
importance to us, hath exceeded the former two.
<PB N="126" REF="128">
It is plea&s;ant to look back on dangers pa&s;t, and
equally as plea&s;ant to meditate on pre&s;ent ones,
when the way out begins to appear. <HI>That</HI> period is
now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is
changing to the &s;weeter pro&s;pects of victory and
joy. At the clo&s;e of the campaign in &s;eventy-five,
you were obliged to retreat from Bo&s;ton. In the
&s;ummer of &s;eventy-&s;ix, you appeared with a numer|ous
fleet and army in the harbour of New York.
By what miracle the Continent was pre&s;erved in
that &s;ea&s;on of danger is a &s;ubject of admiration!
If in&s;tead of wa&s;ting your time again&s;t Long I&s;land,
you had run up the North River, and landed any
where above New York, the con&s;equence mu&s;t
have been, that either you would have compelled
General Wa&s;hington to fight you with very un|equal
numbers, or he mu&s;t have &s;uddenly evacuated
the city, with the lo&s;s of nearly all the &s;tores of the
army, or have &s;urrendered for the want of provi|&s;ions,
the &s;ituation of the place naturally producing
one or other of the&s;e events.</P>
<P>The preparations made to defend New York,
were, neverthele&s;s, wi&s;e and military; becau&s;e
your forces were then at &s;ea, their numbers uncer|tain;
&s;torms, &s;ickne&s;s, or variety of accidents might
have di&s;abled their coming, or &s;o dimini&s;hed them
on their pa&s;&s;age, that tho&s;e which &s;urvived, would
have been incapable of opening the campaign with
<PB N="127" REF="129">
any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; in which ca&s;e, the defence
would have been &s;ufficient, and the place pre&s;erved;
for cities that have been rai&s;ed from nothing with
an infinitude of labour and expence, are not to be
thrown away on the bear probability of their be|ing
taken. On the&s;e grounds, the preparations
made to maintain New York were as judicious as
the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim,
let &s;lip the <HI>very</HI> opportunity, which &s;eemed to put
conque&s;t in your power.</P>
<P>Through the whole of that campaign you had
nearly double the forces which General Wa&s;hing|ton
immediately commanded. The principal
plan, at that time, on our part, was to wear away
the &s;ea&s;on with as little lo&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, and to rai&s;e
the army for the next year. Long-I&s;land, New-York,
Forts Wa&s;hington and Lee, were not de|fended,
after your &s;uperior force was known, under
any expectation of their being finally main|tained,
but as a range of out works, in the attack|ing
of which, your time might be wa&s;ted, your num|bers
reduced, and your vanity amu&s;ed by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
them on our retreat. It was intended to have
withdrawn the garri&s;on from Fort Wa&s;hington,
after it had an&s;wered the former of tho&s;e purpo&s;es,
but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands
without much honour to your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
Your progre&s;s through the Jer&s;esy, was accidental;
you had it not even in contemplation, or you would
not have &s;ent &s;o principal a part of your force to
Rhode I&s;land before hand. The utmo&s;t hope
of America in the year &s;eventy &s;ix reached no
higher than that &s;he might not <HI>then</HI> be conquered.
She had no expectation of defeating you in that
campaign. Even the mo&s;t cowardly tory allowed,
that, could &s;he with&s;tand the &s;hock of <HI>that</HI> &s;um|mer,
her independence would be pa&s;t a doubt. You
had <HI>then</HI> greatly the advantage of her. You were
formidable. Your military knowledge was &s;up|po&s;ed
to be complete. Your fleets and forces
arrived without an accident. You had neither ex|perience
nor reinforcements to wait for. You had
nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in
the fir&s;t vigorous on&s;et,</P>
<P>America was young and un&s;killed. She was
obliged to tru&s;t her defence to time and practice;
and hath, by mere dint of per&s;everance, maintained
her cau&s;e, and brought her enemy to a condition,
in which, &s;he is now capable of meeting him on
any grounds.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in the campaign of &s;eventy-&s;ix,
you gained no more notwith&s;tanding your great
force, than what was given you by con&s;ent of
evacuation, except Fort Wa&s;hington: while every
advantage obtained by us, was by fair and hard
fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was
<PB N="129" REF="131">
complete. The conque&s;t of the He&s;&s;ians at Tren|ton
by the remains of a retreating army, which but
a few days before, you affected to de&s;pi&s;e, is an
in&s;tance of heroic per&s;everance, very &s;eldom to be
met with. And the victory over the Briti&s;h troops
at Princetown, by a harra&s;&s;ed and wearied party,
who had been engaged the day before, and marched
all night without refre&s;hment, is attended with &s;uch
a &s;cene of circum&s;tances and &s;uperiority of general|&s;hip,
as will ever give it a place on the fir&s;t line in
the hi&s;tory of great actions.</P>
<P>When I look back on the gloomy days of la&s;t
winter, and &s;ee America &s;u&s;pended by a thread, I
feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her de|livery,
and a reverence for the characters which
&s;natched her from de&s;truction. To doubt <HI>now,</HI>
would be a &s;pecies of infidelity, and to forget the
in&s;truments which &s;aved us <HI>then,</HI> would be ingrati|tude.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of that campaign, left us with the &s;pi|rits
of conquerors. The northern di&s;tricts were
relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over
the lakes. The army under your command were
hunted back, and had their bounds pre&s;cribed. The
Continent began to feel its military importance,
and the winter pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly away in prepara|tions
for the next campaign.</P>
<P>However confident you might be on your fir&s;t
arrival, the cour&s;e of the year &s;eventy &s;ix, gave
<PB N="130" REF="132">
you &s;ome idea of the difficulty, if not impo&s;&s;ibility
of conque&s;t. To this rea&s;on, I a&s;cribe your delay
in opening the campaign in &s;eventy &s;even. The
face of matters, on the clo&s;e of the &s;ormer year,
gave you no encouragement to pur&s;ue a di&s;cre|tionary
war as &s;oon as the &s;pring admitted the ta|king
the field: for, though conque&s;t in that ca&s;e,
would have given you a double portion of fame,
yet the experiment was too hazardous. The mi|ni&s;try,
had you &s;ailed, would have &s;hifted the whole
blame upon you, charged you with having acted
without orders, and condemned at once, both your
plan and execution.</P>
<P>To avoid tho&s;e misfortunes, which might have
involved you, and your money accounts in per|plexity,
and &s;u&s;picion, you prudently waited the
arrival of a plan of operations from England,
which was, that you &s;hould proceed to Philadel|phia
by the way of Che&s;apeak, and that Burgoyne,
after reducing Ticonderoga, &s;hould take his route
by Albany, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, join you.</P>
<P>The &s;plendid laurels of la&s;t campaign have flou|ri&s;hed
in the north. In that quarter America hath
&s;urprized the world, and laid the foundation of her
this year's glory. The conque&s;t of Ticonderoga
(if it may be called a conque&s;t) has, like all your
other victories, led on to ruin. Even the provi|&s;ions
taken in that fortre&s;s, (which by General Bur|goyne's
<PB N="131" REF="133">
return was &s;ufficent in bread and flour for
nearly 5000 men, for ten weeks, and in beef and
pork for the &s;ame number of men for one month)
&s;erved only to ha&s;ten his overthrow, by enabling
him to proceed for Saratoga, the place of his de|&s;truction.
A &s;hort review of the operations of the
la&s;t campaign, will &s;hew the condition of affairs on
both &s;ides.</P>
<P>You have taken Ticonderoga, and marched into
Philadelphia. The&s;e are all the events which the
year hath produced on your part. A trifling cam|paign
indeed, compared with the expences of Eng|land,
and the conque&s;t of the continent. On the
other &s;ide, a con&s;iderable part of your northern
force has been routed by the New York militia,
under General Herkemer. Fort Stanwix hath
bravely &s;urvived a compounded attack of &s;oldiers
and &s;avages, and the be&s;iegers have fled. The
battle of Bennington has put a thou&s;and pri&s;oners
into our hands, with all their arms, &s;tores, artillery
and baggage. General Burgoyne in two engage|ments
has been defeated; him&s;elf, his army, and all
that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonde|roga
and Independence are retaken, and not the
&s;hadow of an enemy remains in all the northern
di&s;tricts. At this in&s;tant, we have upwards of
eleven thou&s;and pri&s;oners, between &s;ixty and &s;e|venty
pieces of bra&s;s ordnance, be&s;ides &s;mall arms,
tents, &s;tores, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134">
In order to know the real value of tho&s;e advan|tages&punc;
we mu&s;t rever&s;e the &s;cene, and &s;uppo&s;e
General Gates and the force he commanded, to be
at your mercy as pri&s;oners, and General Burgoyne
with his army of &s;oldiers and &s;avages to be already
joined to you in Pen&s;ylvania. So di&s;mal a picture,
can &s;carcely be looked at. It hath all the traces and
colourings of horror and de&s;pair, and excites the
mo&s;t &s;welling emotions of gratitude, by exhibiting
the mi&s;eries we are &s;o graciou&s;ly pre&s;erved from.</P>
<P>I admire this di&s;tribution of laurels around the
continent. It is the earne&s;t of future union. South
Carolina has had her day of &s;uffering and of fame;
and the other &s;outhern &s;tates have exerted them|&s;elves
in proportion to the force that invaded or in|&s;ulted
them. Towards the clo&s;e of the campaign
in &s;eventy &s;ix, the&s;e middle &s;tates were called upon,
and did their duty nobly. They were witne&s;&s;es to
the almo&s;t expiring flame of human freedom. It
was the clo&s;e &s;truggle of life and death. The line
of invi&s;ible divi&s;ion, and on which, the unabated
fortitude of a Wa&s;hington prevailed, and &s;aved the
&s;park, that has &s;ince blazed in the north with unri|valled
lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k, &s;ir, what great exploits have you
performed? Through all the variety of changes
and opporunities which this war hath produced, I
know no one action of yours, that can be &s;tiled ma&s;|terly.
<PB N="133" REF="135">
You have moved in and out&punc; backward and
forward, round and round, as if valour con&s;i&s;ted in
a military jig. The hi&s;tory and figure of your
movements would be truly ridiculous could they be
ju&s;tly delineated. They re&s;emble the labours of
a puppy pur&s;uing his tail, the end is &s;till at the
&s;ame di&s;tance, and all the turnings round mu&s;t be
done over again.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga
wore &s;uch an unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect, that it was nece&s;|&s;ary,
in July, to detach a part of the forces to the
&s;upport of that quarter, which were otherwi&s;e de&s;|tined
or intended to act again&s;t you, and this, per|haps,
has been the means of po&s;tponing your down|fal
to another campaign. The de&s;truction of one
army at a time is work enough. We know, &s;ir,
what we are about, what we have to do, and how to
do it.</P>
<P>Your progre&s;s from Che&s;apeak, was marked by
no capital &s;troke of policy or heroi&s;m. Your prin|cipal
aim was to get General Wa&s;hington between
the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadel|phia
and your army. In that &s;ituation, with a
river on each of his flanks, which united about five
miles below the city, and your army above him,
you could have intercepted his reinforcements and
&s;upplies, cut off all his communication with the
country, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, have di&s;patched a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to open a pa&s;&s;age for General Burgoyne. This
<PB N="134" REF="136">
&s;cheme was too vi&s;ible to &s;ucceed, for had General
Wa&s;hington &s;uffered you to command the open
country above him, I think it a very rea&s;onable
conjecture that the conque&s;t of Burgoyne would not
have taken place, becau&s;e you could, in that ca&s;e,
have relieved him. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary,
while that important victory was in &s;u&s;pence, to
trepan <HI>you</HI> into a &s;ituation, in which you could only
be on the defen&s;ive, without the power of affording
him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The manoeuvre had its effect,
and Burgoyne was conquered.</P>
<P>There has been &s;omething unmilitarily pa&s;&s;ive in
you from the time of your pa&s;&s;ing the Schuylkill, and
getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia, to the clo&s;e of the
campaign, You mi&s;took a trap for a conque&s;t, the
probability of which had been made known to Eu|rope,
and the edge of your triumph taken off by
our own information long before.</P>
<P>Having got you into this &s;ituation, a &s;cheme for a
general attack upon you at Germantown, was car|ried
into execution on the fourth of October, and
though the &s;ucce&s;s was not equal to the excellence
of the plan, yet the attempting it, proved the genius
of America to be on the ri&s;e, and her power ap|proaching
to &s;uperiority. The ob&s;curity of the
morning was your be&s;t friend, for a fog is always
favourable to an hunted enemy. Some weeks
after this, you, likewi&s;e, planned an attack on Ge|neral
<PB N="135" REF="137">
Wa&s;hington while at Whitemar&s;h. Marched
out with infinite paracle, but on finding him pre|paring
to attack you the next morning, you pru|dently
cut about, and retreated to Philadelphia,
with all the precipitation of a man conquered in
imagination.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle of German town, the
probability of Burgoyne's defeat gave a new policy
to affairs in Pen&s;ylvania, and it was judged mo&s;t
con&s;i&s;tent with the general &s;afety of America, to
wait the i&s;&s;ue of the northern campaign. Slow and
&s;ure is &s;ound work. The news of that victory
arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and
no &s;ooner did the &s;hout of joy, and the report of
the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than you re|&s;olved
upon a retreat, and the next day, that is,
on the 19th, withdrew your drooping army into
Philadelphia. This movement was evidently dic|tated
by fear; and carried with it a po&s;itive confe&s;|&s;ion
that you dreaded a &s;econd attack. It was
hiding your&s;elf among women and children, and
&s;leeping away the choice&s;t part of a campaign
in expen&s;ive inactivity. An army in a city can
never be a conquering army. The &s;ituation ad|mits
only of defence. It is a mere &s;helter; and
every military power in Europe will conclude you
to be eventually defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">
The time when you made this retreat, was the
very time you ought to have fought a battle, in
order to put your&s;elf in a condition of recovering
in Pen&s;ylvania, what you had lo&s;t at Saratoga.
And the rea&s;on why you did not, mu&s;t be either
prudence or cowardice; the former &s;uppo&s;es your
inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I
draw no conclu&s;ions, &s;ir, but &s;uch as are naturally
deduced from known and vi&s;ible facts, and &s;uch as
will always have a being while the facts which pro|duced
them remain unaltered.</P>
<P>After this retreat, a new difficulty aro&s;e, which
exhibited the power of Britain in a very contemp|tible
light, which was the attack and defence of Mud
I&s;land. For &s;everal weeks did that little unfini&s;hed
fortre&s;s &s;tand out again&s;t all the attempts of Admiral
and General Howe. It was the fable of Bendar
realized on the Delaware. Scheme after &s;cheme,
and force upon force were tried and defeated. The
garri&s;on, with &s;carce any thing to cover them but
their bravery, &s;urvived in the mid&s;t of mud, &s;hot
and &s;hells, and were at la&s;t obliged to give it up
more to the powers of time and gunpowder, than
to the military &s;uperiority of the be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>It is my &s;incere opinion, that matters are in much
wer&s;e condition with you, than what is generally
known. Your ma&s;ter's &s;peech at the opening of par|liament
is like a &s;oliloquy on ill luck. It &s;hews him to
<PB N="137" REF="139">
be coming a little to his rea&s;on, for &s;en&s;e of pain is
the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of recovery in profound &s;tupefac|tions.
His condition is deplorable. He is obliged
to &s;ubmit to all the in&s;ults of France and Spain, with|out
daring to know or re&s;ent them, and thankful for
the mo&s;t trivial eva&s;ions, to the mo&s;t humble re|mon&s;trances.
The time <HI>was</HI> when he could not
<HI>deign</HI> an an&s;wer to a petition from America, and the
time now <HI>is</HI> when he dare not <HI>give</HI> an an&s;wer to
an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's
army will &s;ink his con&s;equence as much in Europe
as in America. In his &s;peech, he expre&s;&s;es his &s;u&s;|picions
at the warlike preparations of France and
Spain, and he has only the one army which you
command to &s;upport his character in the world
with; it remains very uncertain when, or in what
quarter it will be mo&s;t wanted, or can be be&s;t em|ployed;
and this will partly account for the great
care you take to keep it from action and attacks,
for &s;hould Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it pro|bably
will, England may take her endle&s;s farewel,
not only of all America, but of all the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Never did a nation invite de&s;truction upon it&s;elf
with the eagerne&s;s and ignorance with which Britain
has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young and un|offending
country, &s;he hath drawn the &s;word that
hath wounded her&s;elf to the heart, and in the agony
of her re&s;entment, hath applied a poi&s;on for a cure.
<PB N="138" REF="140">
Her conduct towards America is a compound of
rage and lunacy; &s;he aims at the government of it,
yet pre&s;erves neither dignity nor character in her
methods to obtain it. Were government a mere
manufacture, or article of commerce immaterial by
whom it &s;hould be made or &s;old, we might as well
employ her, as another, but when we con&s;ider it as
the fountain from whence the general manners and
morality of a country take their ri&s;e, that the per|&s;ons
entru&s;ted with the execution thereof, are by
their &s;erious example, and authority to &s;upport
the&s;e principles, how abominably ab&s;urd is the idea
of being hereafter governed by a &s;et of men who
have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery,
theft, and every &s;pecies of villainy, which the lowe&s;t
wretches on earth could practi&s;e or invent. What
greater public cur&s;e can befal any country, than to
be under &s;uch authority, and what greater ble&s;&s;ing,
than to be delivered therefrom. The &s;oul of any
man of &s;entiment, would ri&s;e in brave rebellion
again&s;t them, and &s;purn them from the earth.</P>
<P>The malignant and venomous tempered General
Vaughan has amu&s;ed his &s;avage fancy in burning
the whole town of King&s;ton, in York government,
and the late governor of that &s;tate, Mr. Tryon, in
his letter to General Par&s;ons, has endeavoured to
ju&s;tify it, and declared his with to ju&s;tify it, and de|clared
his wi&s;h to burn the hou&s;es of every com|mittee-man
<PB N="139" REF="141">
in the country. Such a confe&s;&s;ion from
one who was once entru&s;ted with the powers of
civil government, is a reproach to the character.
But it is the wi&s;h and the declaration of a man
whom angui&s;h and di&s;appointment have driven to
de&s;pair, and who is daily decaying into the grave
with con&s;titutional rottenne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is not in the compa&s;s of language a &s;uffi|ciency
of words to expre&s;s the ba&s;ene&s;s of your king,
his mini&s;try, and his army. They have refined
upon villainy till it wants a name. To the fiercer
vices of former ages, they have added the dregs and
&s;cummings of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed ra&s;callity, and are
&s;o completely &s;unk in &s;erpentine deceit, that there
is not left among them <HI>one</HI> generous enemy.</P>
<P>From &s;uch men, and &s;uch ma&s;ters, may the gra|cious
hand of Heaven, pre&s;erve America! And
though her &s;ufferings are heavy and &s;evere, they are
like &s;traws in the wind, compared to the weight of
evils &s;he would feel under the government of your
king, and his pen&s;ioned parliament.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in meanne&s;s which excites a
&s;pecies of re&s;entment that never &s;ub&s;ides, and &s;ome|thing
in cruelty which &s;tirs up the heart to the
highe&s;t agony of human hatred. Britain hath filled
up both the&s;e characters till no addition can be
made, and hath not reputation left with us to ob|tain
credit for the &s;lighte&s;t promi&s;e. The will of
<PB N="140" REF="142">
God hath parted us, and the deed is regi&s;tered for
eternity. When &s;he &s;hall be a &s;pot &s;carcely vi&s;ible
among the nations, America &s;hall flouri&s;h, the fa|vourite
of Heaven, and the friend of mankind.</P>
<P>For the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of Britain, and the
peace of the world, I wi&s;h &s;he had not a foot of
land but what is circum&s;cribed within her own
i&s;land. Extent of dominion hath been her ruin,
and in&s;tead of civilizing others, hath brutalized
her&s;elf. Her late reduction of India, under Clive
and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, was not &s;o properly a conque&s;t,
as an extermination of mankind. She is the only
power who could practi&s;e the prodigal barbarity of
tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and
blowing them away. It happens that General
Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid
tran&s;action in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is now a
pri&s;oner with us, and though an enemy, I can ap|peal
to him for the truth of it, being confident
that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive
received the approbation of the la&s;t parliament.</P>
<P>When we take a &s;urvey of mankind, we cannot
help cur&s;ing the wretch, who, to the unavoidable
misfortunes of nature, &s;hall wilfully add the calami|ties
of war. One would think there were evils
enough in the world without &s;tudying to increa&s;e
them, and that life is &s;ufficiently &s;hort, without
thanking the &s;and that mea&s;ures it. The hi&s;tories of
<PB N="141" REF="143">
Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hi&s;to|ries
of human devils; a good man cannot think of
their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths
without rejoicings. To &s;ee the bounties of Hea|ven
de&s;troyed, the beautiful face of nature laid
wa&s;te, and the choice&s;t works of creation and art
tumbled into ruin, would fetch a cur&s;e from the
&s;oul of piety it&s;elf. But in this country the aggra|vation
is heightened by a new combination of affect|ing
circum&s;tances. America was young, and,
compared with other countries, was virtuous. None,
but a Herod of uncommon malice would have
made war upon infancy and innocence; and none
but a people of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fortitude dared,
under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, have re&s;i&s;ted tyranny.
The natives, or their ance&s;tors had fled from the
former oppre&s;&s;ions of England, and, with the in|du&s;try
of bees, had changed a wilderne&s;s into a
habitable world. To Britain, they were indebted
for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven,
and God alone is their Lord and &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The time, &s;ir, will come, when you, in a melan|choly
hour, &s;hall reckon up your mi&s;eries by your
murders in America. Life, with you, begins to
wear a clouded a&s;pect. The vi&s;ion of plea&s;urable
delu&s;ion is wearing away, and changing to the bar|ren
wild of age and &s;orrow. The poor reflection
of having &s;erved your king, will yield you no con|&s;olation
<PB N="142" REF="144">
in your parting moments. He will crum|ble
to the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hed a&s;hes with your&s;elf,
and have &s;ins enough of his own to an&s;wer for. It
is not the farcical benedictions of a bi&s;hop, nor the
cringing hypocri&s;y of a court of chaplains, nor the
formality of an act of parliament, that can change
guilt into innocence, or make the puni&s;hment of
<HI>one</HI> pang the le&s;s. You may, perhaps, be unwil|ling
to be &s;erious, but this de&s;truction of the goods
of Providence, this havock of the human race, and
this &s;owing the world with mi&s;chief, mu&s;t be ac|counted
for to him who made and governs it. To
us they are only pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, but to him they
are deep rebellions.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;in &s;uperior to every other, it is that
of wilful and offen&s;ive war. Mo&s;t other &s;ins are
circum&s;cribed within narrow limits, that is, the
power of <HI>one</HI> man cannot give them a very general
ten&s;ion, and many kind of &s;ins have only a mental
exi&s;tence, from which no infection ari&s;es; but he
who is the author of a war, lets loo&s;e the whole con|tagion
of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation
to death. We leave it to England and Indians to
boa&s;t of the&s;e honours; we feel no thir&s;t for &s;uch &s;a|vage
glory; a nobler flame, a purer &s;pirit animates
America. She hath taken up the &s;word of virtuous
defence; &s;he hath bravely put her&s;elf between ty|ranny
and freedom, between a cur&s;e and a ble&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="143" REF="145">
determined to expel the one, and protect the other.</P>
<P>It is the object only of war that makes it ho|nourable.
And if ever there were <HI>a ju&s;t</HI> war &s;ince
the world began, it is this which America is now
engaged in. She invaded no land of yours. She
hired no mercenaries to burn your towns, nor
Indians to ma&s;&s;acre their inhabitants. She wanted
nothing from you, and was indebted nothing to
you; and thus circum&s;tanced, her defence is ho|nourable,
and her pro&s;perity certain.</P>
<P>Yet it is not on the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> only, but likewi&s;e on
the <HI>importance</HI> of this cau&s;e, that I ground my &s;eem|ing
enthu&s;ia&s;tical confidence of our &s;ucce&s;s. The
va&s;t exten&s;ion of America, makes her of too much va|lue
in the &s;cale of Providence, to be ca&s;t like a
pearl before &s;wine, at the feet of an European i&s;land;
and of much le&s;s con&s;equence would it be that
Britain were &s;unk in the &s;ea, than that America
&s;hould mi&s;carry. There has been &s;uch a chain of
extraordinary events in the di&s;covery of this
country at fir&s;t, in the peopling and planting it, and
afterwards, in the rearing and nur&s;ing it to its pre|&s;ent
&s;tate, and in the protection of it through the
pre&s;ent war, that no man can doubt, but Provi|dence
hath &s;ome nobler end to accompli&s;h than the
gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover, or
the ignorant and in&s;ignificant King of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
As the blood of the martyrs hath been the &s;eed
of the chri&s;tian church, &s;o the political per&s;ecutions
of England, will, and hath already enriched America
with indu&s;try, experience, union and importance.
Before the pre&s;ent aera &s;he was a mere chaos of un|cemented
colonies, individually expo&s;ed to the ra|vages
of the Indians, and the inva&s;ion of any power
that Britain &s;hould be at war with. She had no|thing
&s;he could call her own. Her felicity de|pended
upon accident. The convul&s;ions of Eu|rope
might have thrown her from one con|queror
to another, till &s;he had been the &s;lave of
all, and ruined by every one; for until &s;he had
&s;pirit enough to become her own ma&s;ter, there was
no knowing to which ma&s;ter &s;he &s;hould belong.
<HI>That</HI> period, thank God, is pa&s;t, and &s;he is no
longer the dependant, di&s;united colonies of Britain,
but the Independent and United States of America,
knowing no ma&s;ter but Heaven and her&s;elf. You
or your king, may call this "Delu&s;ion," "Re|bellion,"
or what name you plea&s;e. To us it is
perfectly indifferent. The i&s;&s;ue will determine
the character, and time will give it a name as la&s;t|ing
as his own.</P>
<P>You have now, &s;ir, tried the fate of three cam|paigns,
and can fully declare to England, that no|thing
is to be got on your part, but blows and bro|ken
bones; and nothing on hers, but wa&s;te of
<PB N="145" REF="147">
trade and credit, and an encrea&s;e of poverty and tax|es.
You are now only where you might have been
two years ago without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle &s;hip, and
yet not a &s;tep the forwarder towards the conque&s;t
of the continent; becau&s;e, as I have already hinted,
"An army in a city can never be a conquering ar|my."
The full amount of your lo&s;&s;es &s;ince the begin|ning
of the war, exceeds twenty thou&s;and men, be|&s;ides
millions of trea&s;ure, for which you have no|thing
in exchange. Our expences, though great,
are circulated within our&s;elves. Yours is a direct
&s;inking of money, and that from both ends at once,
fir&s;t, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in
paying them afterwards, becau&s;e the money in nei|ther
ca&s;e can return again to Britain. We are
already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize, you only in &s;uit
for it. To us it is a real trea&s;ure, to you it would be
only an empty triumph. Our expences will repay
them&s;elves with tenfold intere&s;t, while yours en|tail
upon you everla&s;ting poverty.</P>
<P>Take a review, &s;ir, of the ground you have gone
over, and let it teach you policy, if it cannot ho|ne&s;ty.
You &s;tand upon a very tottering foundation.
A change of the mini&s;try in England, may proba|bly
bring your mea&s;ures into que&s;tion, and your
head to the block. Clive, with all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es,
had &s;ome difficulty in e&s;caping, and yours, being all
a war of lo&s;&s;es, will afford you le&s;s preten&s;ions,
and your enemies more ground for impeachment.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148">
Go home, &s;ir, and endeavour to &s;ave the remains
of your ruined country by a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of
the madne&s;s of her mea&s;ures. A few moments
well applied, may yet pre&s;erve her from political de|&s;truction.
I am not one of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee
Europe in a flame, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded &s;uch an
event will not &s;horten the war. The rupture, at pre|&s;ent,
is confined between the two powers of Ame|rica
and England. England finds &s;he cannot con|quer
America, and America has no wi&s;h to con|quer
England. You are fighting for what you can
never obtain, and we defending what we mean
never to part with. A few words, therefore,
&s;ettle the bargain. Let England, mind her
own bu&s;ine&s;s, and we will mind ours. Govern
your&s;elves and we will govern our&s;elves. You may
then trade where you plea&s;e unmole&s;ted by us, and
we will trade where we plea&s;e unmole&s;ted by you;
and &s;uch articles as we can purcha&s;e of each other
better than el&s;ewhere, may be mutually done. If
it were po&s;&s;ible that you could carry on the war for

&s;trength, and exhau&s;ted coffers in a three years war

<HEAD>To the Inhabitants of America.</HEAD>
<P>WITH all the plea&s;ure with which a man ex|changes
bad company for good, I take my leave of
Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly
three years &s;ince the tyranny of Britain received its
fir&s;t repul&s;e by the arms of America. A period,
which has given birth to the New World, and
erected a monument of folly to the old.</P>
<P>I cannot help being &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed at the
complimentary references, which I have &s;een and
heard made to ancient hi&s;tories and tran&s;actions.
The wi&s;dom of civil governments, and &s;en&s;e of ho|nour
of the States of Greece and Rome, are fre|quently
held up as objects of excellence and imita|tion.
Mankind have lived for very little purpo&s;e,
if, at this period of the world, they mu&s;t go two or
three thou&s;and years back for le&s;&s;ons and examples.
We do di&s;honourary inju&s;tice to our&s;elves by pla|cing
them in &s;uch a &s;uperior line. We have no ju&s;t
authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that
we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves inferior.</P>
<P>Could the mi&s;t of antiquity be taken away, and
men and things viewed as they then really were,
it is more than probable that they would admire us,
rather than we them. America has &s;urmounted a
<PB N="149" REF="151">
greater variety and combination of difficulties, than,
I believe, ever fell to the &s;hare of any one peo|ple
in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, and has repleni&s;hed
the world with more u&s;eful knowledge, and &s;ounder
maxims of civil government than were ever pro|duced
in any age before. Had it not been for
America, there had been no &s;uch thing as freedom
left throughout the whole univer&s;e. England hath
lo&s;t hers, in a long chain of right rea&s;oning from
wrong principles, and it is from this now &s;he mu&s;t
learn the re&s;olution to redre&s;s her&s;elf, and the wi&s;|dom
how.</P>
<P>The Grecians and Romans were &s;trongly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of liberty, but <HI>not</HI> the <HI>principle,</HI>
for at the time they were determined not to be
&s;laves them&s;elves, they employed their power to
en&s;lave the re&s;t of mankind. But this di&s;tingui&s;hed
aera is blotted by no one mi&s;anthropical vice. In
&s;hort, if the principle on which the cau&s;e is founded,
the univer&s;al ble&s;&s;ings that are to ari&s;e from
it, the difficulties that accompanied it; the wi&s;|dom
with which it has been debated, the
&s;ortitude by which it has been &s;upported, the
&s;trength of the power we had to oppo&s;e, and the
condition in which we undertook it, be all taken
in one view, we may ju&s;tly &s;tile it, the mo&s;t virtuous
and illu&s;trious revolution that ever graced the hi&s;|tory
of mankind.</P>
<P>A good opinion of our&s;elves is exceedingly
nece&s;&s;ary in private life, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in
<PB N="150" REF="152">
public life; and of the utmo&s;t importance in &s;up|porting
national character. I have no notion of
yielding the palm of the United States to any Gre|cians
or Romans that were ever born. We have
equalled the brave&s;t in times of danger, and ex|celled
the wi&s;e&s;t in the con&s;truction of civil go|vernments,
<HI>no one in America excepted.</HI></P>
<P>From this agreeable eminence, let us take a re|view
of pre&s;ent affairs. The &s;pirit of corruption
is &s;o in&s;eparably interwoven with Briti&s;h politics,
that their mini&s;try &s;uppo&s;e all mankind are go|verned
by the &s;ame motive. They have no idea of
people &s;ubmitting even to a temporary inconveni|ence,
from an attachment to rights and privileges.
Their plans of bu&s;ine&s;s are calculated <HI>by</HI> the hour,
and <HI>for</HI> the hour, and are uniform in nothing but
in the corruption which give them birth. They
never had, neither have they at this time, any re|gular
plan for the conque&s;t of America by arms.
They know not how to go about it, neither have
they the power to effect it, if they could know. The
thing is not within the compa&s;s of human practicabi|lity,
for America is too exten&s;ive either to be fully
conquered, or <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> defended. But &s;he may be
<HI>actively</HI> defended, by defeating or making pri&s;oners
of the army that invades her. And this is the
only &s;y&s;tem of defence that can be effectual in a
large country.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153">
There is &s;omething in a war carried on by in|va&s;ion,
which makes it differ in circum&s;tances
from any other mode of war, becau&s;e, he who
conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains,
be for him, or again&s;t him, when he fir&s;t makes
it. In the winter of &s;eventy &s;ix, General Howe,
marched with an air of victory through the Jer|&s;eys,
the con&s;equence of which, was his defeat,
and General Burgoyne, at Saratoga experienced
the &s;ame fate from the &s;ame cau&s;e. The Spaniards,
about two years ago, were defeated by the Alge|rines
in the &s;ame manner, that is, their fir&s;t tri|umphs
became a trap, in which they were totally
routed. And, whoever will attend to the circum|&s;tances,
and events of a war carried on by inva&s;ion,
will find, that any invader, in order to be finally
conquered, mu&s;t begin fir&s;t to conquer.</P>
<P>I confefs my&s;elf one of tho&s;e who believe the
lo&s;s of Philadelphia to be attended with more ad|vantages
than injuries. The ca&s;e &s;tood thus. The
enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more im|portance
to us, than it really was; for we all know
that it had long cea&s;ed to be a port, not a cargo
of goods had been brought into it for near a
twelvemonth, nor any fixed manufactories, nor
even &s;hip-building carried on in it; yet, as the
enemy believed the conque&s;t of it to be prac|ticable,
and, to that belief, added the ab&s;urd idea,
that the &s;oul of all America was centered there,
and would be conquered there, it naturally follows,
<PB N="152" REF="154">
that their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, by not an&s;wering the end
propo&s;ed, mu&s;t break up the plans they had fool|i&s;hly
gone upon, and either oblige them to form a
new one, for which their pre&s;ent &s;trength is not
&s;ufficient, or to give over the attempt.</P>
<P>We never had &s;o &s;mall an army to fight again&s;t,
nor &s;o fair an opportunity of final &s;ucce&s;s as <HI>now.</HI>
The death wound is already given. The day is
our own, if we follow it up. The enemy by his
&s;ituation is within our reach, and by his reduced
&s;trength is within our power. The mini&s;ters of
Britain may rage as they plea&s;e, but our part is to
conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and
welcome, but let it not draw our attention from
the <HI>one</HI> thing needful. <HI>Here, in this</HI> &s;pot is our
bu&s;ine&s;s to be accompli&s;hed; our felicity &s;ecured.
What we have now to do, is as clear as light, and
the way to do it is as &s;trait as a line. It needs
not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be per|fectly
under&s;tood, I will put a ca&s;e that cannot ad|mit
of a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Had the armies under Generals Howe and Bur|goyne
been united and taken po&s;t at Germantown,
and had the northern army, under General Gates,
been joined to that under General Wa&s;hington, at
Whitemar&s;h, the con&s;equence would have been a
general action; and, if in that action, we had killed
and taken the &s;ame number of officers and men,
that is, between nine and ten thou&s;and, with the
<PB N="153" REF="155">
&s;ame quantity of artillery, arms, &s;tores, &amp;c. as have
been taken at the northward, and obliged General
Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with
the &s;ame number he now commands, to take &s;helter
in Philadelphia, we &s;hould certainly have thought
our&s;elves the greate&s;t heroes in the world; and
&s;hould as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on permitted, have col|lected
together all the force of the continent, and
laid &s;iege to the city, for it requires a much greater
force to be&s;iege an enemy in a town, than to defeat
them in the field. The ca&s;e <HI>now</HI> is ju&s;t the &s;ame,
as if it had been produced by the means I have
here &s;uppo&s;ed. Between nine and ten thou&s;and
have been killed and taken, all their &s;tores are in
our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and General Howe in con&s;equence
of that victory, has thrown him&s;elf for &s;helter into
Philadelphia. He, or his trifling friend Galloway,
may form what pretences they plea&s;e, yet no ju&s;t
rea&s;on can be given for their going into winter
quarters &s;o early as the 19th of October, but their
apprehen&s;ion of a defeat if they continued out, or
their con&s;cious inability to keep the field with
&s;afety. I &s;ee no advantage which can ari&s;e to
America, by hunting the enemy from State to
State. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly
unworthy the attention of a people determined to
conquer. Neither can any State promi&s;e to it&s;elf
&s;ecurity, while the enemy remains in a condition to
tran&s;port them&s;elves from one part of the continent
<PB N="154" REF="156">
to another. Howe, likewi&s;e, cannot conquer where
we have no army to oppo&s;e, therefore any &s;uch re|movals
in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces
Britain to a common pilferer. If he retreats from
Philadelphia, he will be de&s;pi&s;ed; if he &s;tays, he
may be &s;hut up and &s;tarved out, and the country,
if he advances into, may become his Saratoga. He
has his choice of evils, and we of opportunities. If
he moves early, it is not only a &s;ign, but a proof
that he expects no reinforcement, and his delays
will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a
plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both:
in <HI>which</HI> ca&s;e, our &s;trength will encrea&s;e more than
his, therefore, in <HI>any</HI> ca&s;e, we cannot be wrong, if
we do but proceed.</P>
<P>The particular condition of Pen&s;ylvania, de&s;erves
the attention of all the other States. Her military
&s;trength mu&s;t not be e&s;timated by the number of
inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, charac|ters,
profe&s;&s;ions, and intere&s;ts. Here are the firme&s;t
whigs, &s;urviving, like &s;parks in the ocean, un|quenched
and uncooled, in the mid&s;t of di&s;courage|ment
and di&s;affection. Here are men lo&s;ing their
all with cheerfulne&s;s, and collecting fire and forti|tude,
from the flames of their own e&s;tates. Here
are others &s;kulking in &s;ecret; many making a mar|ket
of the times; and numbers, who are changing
whig and tory with the circum&s;tances of every
day.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">
It is by mere dint of fortitude and per&s;everance,
that the whigs of this &s;tate, have been able to main|tain
&s;o good a countenance, and do even what they
have done. We want help, and the &s;ooner it can
arrive, the more effectual it will be. The invaded
&s;tate, be it which it may, will always feel an ad|ditional
burthen upon its back, and be hard
&s;et to &s;upport its civil power with &s;ufficient
authority: and this difficulty will always ri&s;e or
fall in proportion as the other &s;tates throw in their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemy will mo&s;t probably make many ma|noeuvres
at the opening of this campaign, to amu&s;e
and draw off the attention of the &s;everal &s;tates from
the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> We may expect to hear of
alarms, and pretended expeditions to <HI>this</HI> place,
and <HI>that</HI> place; to the &s;outhward, the ea&s;tward, and
the northward, all intended to prevent our forming
into one formidable body. The le&s;s the enemy's
&s;trength is, the more &s;ubtleties of this kind will
they make u&s;e of. Their exi&s;tence depends upon
it, becau&s;e the force of America, when collected, is
&s;ufficient to &s;wallow their pre&s;ent army up. It is
therefore our bu&s;ine&s;s to make &s;hort work of it, by
bending our whole attention to <HI>this one principal
point,</HI> for the in&s;tant that the main body, under Ge|neral
Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms
throughout the continent, like &s;o many &s;hadows,
will follow his downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">
The only way to fini&s;h a war with the lea&s;t po&s;|&s;ible
blood&s;hed, or perhaps without any, is to col|lect
an army, again&s;t the power of which, the enemy
&s;hall have no chance. By not doing this, we pro|long
the war, and double both the calamities and
the expences of it. What a rich and happy coun|try
would America be, were &s;he, by a vigourous
exertion, to reduce Howe, as &s;he hath reduced
Burgoyne. Her currency would ri&s;e to millions
beyond its pre&s;ent value. Every man would be
rich, and every man would have it in his power to
be happy. And why not do the&s;e things? What
is there to hinder? America is her own mi&s;tre&s;s, and
can do what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>If we had not at this time a man in the field, we
could, neverthele&s;s, rai&s;e an army in a few weeks,
&s;ufficient to overwhelm all the force which General
Howe at pre&s;ent commands. Vigour and determi|nation
will do any thing and every thing. We be|gan
the war with this kind of &s;pirit, why not end
it with the &s;ame? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy.
Here is the army. The intere&s;t, the happine&s;s of all
America is centered in this half ruined &s;pot. Come
on and help us. Here are laurels, come and &s;hare
them. Here are tories, come and help us to expel
them. Here are whigs that will make you wel|come,
and enemies that dread your coming,</P>
<P>The wor&s;t of all policy, is that of doing things by
halves. Penny wi&s;e and pound fooli&s;h, has been
<PB N="157" REF="159">
the ruin of thou&s;ands. The pre&s;ent &s;pring, if
rightly improved, will free us from all our troubles,
and &s;ave us the expence of millions. We have
now only one army to cope with. No opportu|nity
can be fairer; no pro&s;pect more promi&s;ing.
I &s;hall conclude this paper, with a few outlines of a
plan, either for filling up the battalions with expe|dition,
or for rai&s;ing an additional force, for any
limited time, on any &s;udden emergency.</P>
<P>That in which every man is intere&s;ted, is every
man's duty to &s;upport. And any burthen which
falls equally on all men, and, from which every
man is to receive an equal benefit, is con&s;i&s;tent
with the mo&s;t perfect ideas of liberty. I would
wi&s;h to revive &s;omething of that virtuous ambition
which fir&s;t called America into the field. Then
every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps
the principal rea&s;on why we have in any degree
fallen therefrom, is, becau&s;e we did not &s;et a &s;ufficient
value by it at fir&s;t, but left it to blaze out by it&s;elf,
in&s;tead of regulating and pre&s;erving it by ju&s;t pro|portions
of re&s;t and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e any &s;tate, who&s;e number of effective
inhabitants was 80,000, &s;hould be required to fur|ni&s;h
3,200 men towards the defence of the conti|nent
on any &s;udden emergency.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Let the whole number of effective inhabi|tants
be divided into hundreds; then if each of tho&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="160">
hundreds turn out four men, the whole number of
3,200 will be had.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let the names of each hundred men be
entered in a book, and let four dollars be collected
from each man, with as much more as any of the
gentlemen who&s;e abilities can afford it, &s;hall plea&s;e
to throw in, which gifts &s;hall likewi&s;e be entered
again&s;t the donors names.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Let the &s;ums &s;o collected be offered as a
pre&s;ent, over and above the bounty of twenty
dollars, to any four who may be inclined to pro|po&s;e
them&s;elves as volunteers; if more than four
offer, the majority of the &s;ub&s;cribers pre&s;ent &s;hall
determine which; if none offer, then four out of
the hundred &s;hall be taken by lot, who &s;hall be en|titled
to the &s;aid &s;ums, and &s;hall either go, or pro|vide
others that will, in the &s;pace of &s;ix days.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As it will always happen, that in the
&s;pace of ground on which an hundred men &s;hall
live, there will be always a number of per&s;ons, who,
by age and infirmity, are incapable of doing per|&s;onal
&s;ervice, and as &s;uch per&s;ons are generally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the greate&s;t part of the property in any
county, their portion of &s;ervice, therefore, will be
to furni&s;h each man with a blanket, which will
make a regimental coat, jacket and breeches, or
cloaths in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak,
and two pair of &s;hoes&mdash;for however choice people
may be of the&s;e things, matters not in ca&s;es of this
<PB N="159" REF="161">
kind&mdash;Tho&s;e who live always in hou&s;es, can find
many ways to keep them&s;elves warm, but it is a
&s;hame and a &s;in to &s;uffer a &s;oldier in the field to
want a blanket while there is one in the country.</P>
<P>Should the cloathing not be wanted, the &s;uperan|nuated
or infirm per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing property, may,
in lieu thereof, throw in their money &s;ub&s;criptions,
towards encrea&s;ing the bounty; for though age will
naturally exempt a per&s;onal &s;ervice, it cannot ex|empt
him from his &s;hare of the charge, becau&s;e the
men are rai&s;ed for the defence of property and li|berty
jointly.</P>
<P>There never was a &s;cheme again&s;t which objec|tions
might not be rai&s;ed. But this alone is not a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejection. The only line to
judge truly upon, is, to draw out and admit all
the objections which can fairly be made, and
place again&s;t them all the contrary qualities, con|veniences,
and advantages, then by &s;triking a ba|lance,
you come at the true character of any &s;cheme,
principle or po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t material advantages of the plan here
propo&s;ed, are ea&s;e, expedition, and cheapne&s;s; yet
the men &s;o rai&s;ed, get a much larger bounty, than
is, any where, at pre&s;ent given; becau&s;e all the ex|pences,
extravagance, and con&s;equent idlene&s;s of
recruiting are &s;aved or prevented. The country
incurs no new debt, nor intere&s;t thereon; the whole
matter being all &s;ettled at once, and entirely done
<PB N="160" REF="162">
with. It is a &s;ub&s;cription an&s;wering all the purpo&s;es
of a tax, without either the charge or trouble of
collecting. The men are ready for the field
with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible expedition, becau&s;e, it
becomes the duty of the inhabitants them&s;elves, in
every part of the country, to find up their propor|tion
of men, in&s;tead of leaving it to a recruiting
&s;erjeant, who, be he ever &s;o indu&s;trious, cannot
know always where to apply.</P>
<P>I do not propo&s;e this as a regular dige&s;ted plan,
neither will the limits of this paper admit any fur|ther
remarks upon it. I believe it to be a hint ca|pable
of much improvement, and as &s;uch &s;ubmit it
to the public.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Earl of Carli&s;le, General Clinton, and
William Eden, E&s;q. Briti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners, at
New York.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a dignity in the warm pa&s;&s;ions of a
whig, which is never to be found in the cold ma|lice
of a tory. In the one, nature is only heated
&mdash;in the other &s;he is poi&s;oned. The in&s;tant the
former has it in his power to puni&s;h, he feels a
di&s;po&s;ition to forgive; but the canine venom of
the latter knows no relief but revenge. This ge|neral
di&s;tinction, will, I believe, apply in all ca&s;es,
and &s;uit as well the meridian of England as
America.</P>
<P>As I pre&s;ume your la&s;t proclamation will un|dergo
the &s;trictures of other pens, I &s;hall confine
my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that
you have &s;aid, might have been compri&s;ed in half
the compa&s;s. It is tedious and unmeaning, and
only a repetition of your former follies, with here
and there an offen&s;ive aggravation. Your cargo
of pardons will have no market&mdash;It is unfa&s;hionable
<PB N="162" REF="164">
to look at them Even &s;peculation is at an end.
They are become a perfect drug, and no way cal|culated
for the climate.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of your proclamation, you &s;ay,
"The policy, as well as the BENEVOLENCE
OF GREAT BRITAIN, have thus far checked
the extremes of war, when they tended to di&s;tre&s;s a
people, &s;till con&s;idered as their fellow &s;ubjects, and
to de&s;olate a country &s;hortly to become again a
&s;ource of mutual advantage." What you mean
by "the BENEVOLENCE of Great Britain,"
is to me, inconceivable. To put a plain que&s;tion:
Do you con&s;ider your&s;elves men or devils? For
until this point is &s;ettled, no determinate &s;en&s;e can
be put upon the expre&s;&s;ion. You have already
equalled, and in many places excelled the &s;avages
of either Indies; and if you have yet a cruelty in
&s;tore, you mu&s;t have imported it unmixed with
every human material from the original warehou&s;e
of hell.</P>
<P>To the interpo&s;ition of Providence, and her
ble&s;&s;ings on our endeavours, and not to BRITISH
BENEVOLENCE, are we indebted for the &s;hort
chain that limits your ravages. Remember, you
do not at this time, command a foot of land on the
continent of America. Staten I&s;land, York I&s;land,
a &s;mall part of Long I&s;land and Rhode I&s;land,
circum&s;cribe your power; and even tho&s;e you hold
at the expence of the We&s;t Indies. To avoid a
<PB N="163" REF="165">
defeat, and prevent a de&s;ertion of your troops, you
have taken up your quarters in holes and corners
of inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity; and in order to conceal
what every one can conceive, you now endeavour
to impo&s;e your weakne&s;s upon us for an act of
mercy. If you think to &s;ucceed by &s;uch &s;hadowy
devices, you are but infants in the political world;
you have the A, B, C, of &s;tratagem yet to learn,
and are wholly ignorant of the people you have to
contend with. Like men in a &s;tate of intoxica|tion,
you forget that the re&s;t of the world have eyes,
and that the &s;ame &s;tupidity which conceals you
from your&s;elves, expo&s;es you to their &s;atire and
contempt.</P>
<P>The paragraph I have quoted, &s;tands as an in|troduction
to the following: "But when that coun|try
(America) profe&s;&s;es the unnatural de&s;ign, not
only of e&s;tranging her&s;elf from us, but of mortga|ging
her&s;elf and her re&s;ources to our enemies, the
whole conte&s;t is changed; and the que&s;tion is,
how far Great Britain may, by every means in her
power, de&s;troy or render u&s;ele&s;s, a connection con|trived
for her ruin, and the aggrandizement of
France. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the laws of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation mu&s;t direct the conduct of Britain,
and if the Briti&s;h Colonies are to become an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to France, will direct her, to render that
acce&s;&s;ion of as little avail as po&s;&s;ible to her enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
I con&s;ider you, in this declaration, like madmen
biting in the hour of death. It contains, likewi&s;e,
a fraudulent meanne&s;s; for, in order to ju&s;tify a
barbarous conclu&s;ion, you have advanced a fal&s;e
po&s;ition. The treaty we have formed with France
is open, noble and generous. It is the true policy,
founded on &s;ound philo&s;ophy, and neither a &s;urren|der
or mortgage, as you would &s;candalou&s;ly in&s;inu|ate.
I have &s;een every article, and &s;peak from
po&s;itive knowledge. In France, we have found an
affectionate friend, a faithful ally; from Britain
nothing but tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.</P>
<P>But the happine&s;s is, that the mi&s;chief you
threaten, is not in your power to execute; and if it
were, the puni&s;hment would return upon you, in a
tenfold degree. The humanity of America, hath
hitherto, re&s;trained her from acts of retaliation, and
the affection &s;he retains for many individuals in
England, who have fed, clothed, and comforted her
pri&s;oners, has, to the pre&s;ent day, warded off her
re&s;entment, and operated as a &s;creen to the whole.
But even the&s;e con&s;iderations mu&s;t cea&s;e, when na|tional
objects interfere and oppo&s;e them. Re|peated
aggravations will provoke a retort, and po|licy
ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure. We mean now to take you
&s;eriou&s;ly up upon your own ground and principles,
and as you do, &s;o &s;hall you be done by.</P>
<P>You ought to know, gentlemen, that England
and Scotland, are far more expo&s;ed to incendiary
<PB N="165" REF="167">
de&s;olation than America in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, can
po&s;&s;ibly be. We occupy a country, with but few
towns, and who&s;e riches con&s;i&s;t in land and annual
produce. The two la&s;t can &s;u&s;&s;er but little, and
that only within a very limited compa&s;s. In Bri|tain,
it is otherwi&s;e. Her wealth lies chiefly in
cities and large towns, the repo&s;itories of manufac|tures,
and fleets of merchantmen.&mdash;There is not a
nobleman's country &s;eat but may be laid in a&s;hes
by a &s;ingle per&s;on. Your own, may probably con|tribute
to the proof: In &s;hort, there is no evil
which cannot be returned, when you come to incen|diary
mi&s;chief.&mdash;The &s;hips in the Thames, may cer|tainly
be ea&s;ily &s;et on fire, as the temporary
bridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair, no
di&s;covery was ever made; and the lo&s;s you would
&s;u&s;tain by &s;uch an event, executed at a proper &s;ea|&s;on,
is infinitely greater than any you can inflict.
The Ea&s;t India hou&s;e, and the bank, neither,
are, nor can be &s;ecure from this &s;ort of de&s;truction,
and, as Dr. Price ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, a fire at the latter
would bankrupt the nation. It has never been
the cu&s;tom of France and England, when at war,
to make tho&s;e havocs on each other, becau&s;e the
ea&s;e with which they could retaliate, rendered it as
impolitic, as if each had de&s;troyed his own.</P>
<P>But think not, gentlemen, that our di&s;tance &s;e|cures
you, or our invention fails us. We can much
ea&s;ier accompli&s;h &s;uch a point than any nation in Eu|rope.
<PB N="166" REF="168">
We talk the &s;ame language, dre&s;s in the
&s;ame habit, and appear with the &s;ame manners as
your&s;elves. We can pa&s;s from one part of Eng|land
to another un&s;u&s;pected; many of us are
as well acquainted with the country as you are, and
&s;hould you impoliticly provoke our will, you will
mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly lament the effects of it. Mi&s;chiefs
of this kind, requires no army to execute them.
The means are obvious, and the opportunities un|guardable.
I hold up a warning piece to your
&s;en&s;es, if you have any left, and "to the unhappy
people likewi&s;e, who&s;e affairs are committed to
you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Clinton's letter to Congre&s;s.</NOTE>." I call not with the rancour of an enemy,
but with the earne&s;tne&s;s of a friend, on the deluded
people of England, le&s;t, between your blunders and
theirs, they &s;ink beneath the evils contrived for us.</P>
<P>"He who lives in a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, &s;ays the Spa|ni&s;h
proverb, &s;hould never begin throwing &s;tones."
This, gentlemen, is exactly your ca&s;e, and you
mu&s;t be the mo&s;t ignorant of mankind, or &s;uppo&s;e
us &s;o, not to &s;ee on which &s;ide the balance of ac|counts
will fall. There are many other modes of
retaliation, which for &s;everal rea&s;ons, I choo&s;e not
to mention. But, be a&s;&s;ured of this, that the in|&s;tant
you put a threat in execution, a counter blow
will follow it. If you openly profe&s;s your&s;elves
&s;avages, it is high time we &s;hould treat you as &s;uch,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
and if nothing but di&s;tre&s;s can recover you to rea|&s;on,
to puni&s;h, will become an office of charity.</P>
<P>While your fleet lay la&s;t winter in the Delaware, I
offered my &s;ervice to the Pen&s;ylvanian navy-board,
then at Trenton, as one who would make a party with
them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedi|tion
down the river, to &s;et fire to it, and though it
was not then accepted, nor the thing per&s;onally
attempted, it is more than probable, that your own
folly will provoke a much more vulnerable part.
Say not, when the mi&s;chief is done, that you had
warning, and remember that we did not begin it,
but mean to repay it. Thus much for your &s;avage
and impolitic threat.</P>
<P>In another part of your proclamation you &s;ay,
"But if the honours of a military life, are become
the object of the Americans, let them &s;eek tho&s;e
honours, under the banners of their rightful &s;ove|reign,
and in fighting the battles of the united Bri|ti&s;h
empire, again&s;t our late mutual and natural
enemies." Surely! The union of ab&s;urdity with
madne&s;s, was never marked with more di&s;tingui&s;h|able
lines than the&s;e. Your rightful &s;overeign as
you call him, may do well enough for you, who
dare not enquire into the humble capacities of the
man; but we, who e&s;timate per&s;ons and things by
their real worth, cannot &s;uffer our judgments to be
&s;o impo&s;ed upon; and, unle&s;s it is your wi&s;h to
&s;ee him expo&s;ed, it ought to be your endeavour to
<PB N="168" REF="170">
keep him out of &s;ight. The le&s;s you have to &s;ay
about him the better. We have done with him,
and that ought to be an&s;wer enough. You have
often been told &s;o. Strange! that the an&s;wer mu&s;t
be &s;o often repeated. You go a begging with your
king as with a brat, or with &s;ome un&s;aleable com|modity
you were tired of; and though every body
tells, no, no, &s;till you keep hawking him about.
But there is one who will have him in a little time,
and as we have no inclination to di&s;appoint you of a
cu&s;tomer, we bid you nothing for him.</P>
<P>The impertinent folly of the paragraph I have
ju&s;t quoted, de&s;erve no other notice than to be
laughed at, and thrown by, but the principle on
which it is founded, is dete&s;table. We are invited
to &s;ubmit to a man who has attempted by every
cruelty to de&s;troy us, and to join him in making
war again&s;t France, who is already at war again&s;t
him for our &s;upport.</P>
<P>Can Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a
more mad and devili&s;h reque&s;t; Were it po&s;&s;ible a
people could &s;ink into &s;uch apo&s;tacy, they would
de&s;erve to be &s;wept from the earth, like the inhabi|tants
of Sodom and Gomorrah. The propo&s;ition
is an univer&s;al affront to the rank which man holds
in the creation, and an indignity to him who
placed him there. It &s;uppo&s;es him made up with|out
a &s;park of honour, and under no obligation to
God or man.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="171">
What &s;ort of men or Chri&s;tians mu&s;t you &s;uppo&s;e
the Americans to be, who, after &s;eeing their mo&s;t
humble petitions in&s;ultingly rejected, the mo&s;t griev|ous
laws pa&s;&s;ed to di&s;tre&s;s them in every quarter,
an undeclared war let loo&s;e upon them, and Indians
and negroes invited to the &s;laughter; who after
&s;eeing their kindred murdered, their fellow citizens
&s;tarved to death in pri&s;ons, and their hou&s;es and
property de&s;troyed and buried; who after the mo&s;t
&s;erious appeals to heaven, the mo&s;t &s;olemn abjura|tion
by oath of all government connected with you,
and the mo&s;t heart-felt pledges and prote&s;tations
of faith to each other; and who, after &s;oliciting
the friend&s;hip, and entering into alliances with other
nations, &s;hould at la&s;t break through all the&s;e obli|gations,
civil and divine, by complying with your
horrid and infernal propo&s;al. Ought we ever after
to be con&s;idered as a part of the human race? Or,
ought we not rather to be blotted from the &s;ociety
of mankind, and become a &s;pectacle of mi&s;ery to
the world? But there is &s;omething in corruption,
which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the colour of
of it&s;elf to the object it looks upon, and &s;ees every
thing &s;tained and impure; for unle&s;s you were
capable of &s;uch conduct your&s;elves, you could never
have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch a character in us. The offer
fixes your infamy. It exhibits you as a nation
without faith, with whom oaths and treaties are
con&s;idered as trifles, and the breaking them, as the
<PB N="170" REF="172">
breaking of a bubble. Regard to decency or to
rank, might have taught you better, or pride in|&s;pired
you, though virtue could not. There is not
left a &s;tep in the degradation of character to which
you can now de&s;cend; you have put your foot on
the ground floor, and the key of the dungeon is
turned upon you.</P>
<P>That the invitation may want nothing of being a
complete mon&s;ter, you have thought proper to fini&s;h
it with an a&s;&s;ertion which has no foundation, either
in fact or philo&s;ophy; and as Mr. Fergu&s;on, your
&s;ecretary, is a man of letters, and has made
civil &s;ociety his &s;tudy, and publi&s;hed a treati&s;e on
that &s;ubject, I addre&s;s this part to him.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of the paragraph which I la&s;t quoted,
France is &s;tiled the "natural enemy" of England,
and by way of lugging us into &s;ome &s;trange idea, &s;he
is &s;tiled the "late mutual and natural enemy" of
both countries. I deny that &s;he ever was the na|tural
enemy of either, and that there does not exi&s;t
in nature &s;uch a principle. The expre&s;&s;ion is an
unmeaning barbari&s;m, and wholly unphilo&s;ophical,
when applied to beings of the &s;ame &s;pecies, let their
&s;tation in the creation be what it may. We have
a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of
the devil, becau&s;e the enmity is perpetual, unalter|able,
and unabateable. It admits neither of peace,
truce, or treaty; con&s;equently the warfare is eternal,
and therefore it is natural. But man with man
<PB N="171" REF="173">
cannot arrange in the &s;ame oppo&s;ition. Their
quarrels are accidental and equivocally created.
They become friends or enemies at the change of
temper, as the ca&s;t of intere&s;t inclines them. The
Creator of man did not con&s;titute them the natural
enemy of each other. He has not made any one
order of beings &s;o. Even wolves may quarrel, &s;till
they herd together. If any two nations are &s;o, then
mu&s;t all nations be &s;o, otherwi&s;e it is not nature,
but cu&s;tom, and the offence frequently originates
with the accu&s;er. England is as truly the natural
enemy of France, as France is of England, and,
perhaps, more &s;o. Separated from the re&s;t of Eu|rope,
&s;he has contracted an un&s;ocial habit of man|ners,
and imagines in others the jealou&s;y &s;he creates
in her&s;elf. Never long &s;atisfied with peace, &s;he
&s;uppo&s;es the di&s;content univer&s;al, and buoyed up
with her own importance, conceives her&s;elf the
only object pointed at. The expre&s;&s;ion has been
often u&s;ed, and always with a fraudulent de&s;ign;
for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived,
it prevents all other enquiries, and the real cau&s;e of
the quarrel is hidden in the univer&s;ality of the con|ceit.
Men &s;tart at the notion of a natural enemy,
and a&s;k no other que&s;tion. The cry obtains credi
like the alarm of a mad dog, and is one of tho&s;e
kind of tricks, which, by operating on the com|mon
pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ecures their intere&s;t through their
folly.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="174">
But we, &s;ir, are not to be thus impo&s;ed upon.
We live in a large world, and have extended our
ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an i&s;land.
We hold out the right hand of friend&s;hip to all the
univer&s;e, and we conceive there to be a &s;ociality in
the manners of France, which is much better di&s;|po&s;ed
to peace and negociation than that of Eng|land,
and until the latter becomes more civilized,
&s;he cannot expect to live long at peace with any
power. Her common language is vulgar and of|fen&s;ive,
and children, with their milk, &s;uck in the
rudiments of in&s;ult.&mdash;"The arm of Britain! The
mighty arm of Britain! Britain that &s;hakes the
earth to its center and its poles! The &s;courge of
France! The terror of the world! That governs
with a nod, and pours down vengeance like a
God." This language neither makes a nation great
or little; but it &s;hews a &s;avagene&s;s of manners, and
has a tendency to keep national animo&s;ity alive.
The entertainments of the &s;tage are calculated to
the &s;ame end, and almo&s;t every public exhibition is
tinctured with in&s;ult. Yet England is always in
dread of France. Terrified at the apprehen&s;ion of
an inva&s;ion. Su&s;picious of being outwitted in a treaty
and privately cringing, though &s;he is publicly of|fending.
Let her therefore, reform her manners,
and do ju&s;tice, and &s;he will find the idea of a natural
enemy, to be only a phantom of her own ima|gination.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="175">
Little did I think, at this period of the war, to
&s;ee a proclamation which could promi&s;e you no one
u&s;eful purpo&s;e whatever, and tend only to expo&s;e
you. One would think you were ju&s;t awakened
from a four years dream, and knew nothing of
what had pa&s;&s;ed in the interval. Is this a time to
be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgot|ten
&s;ubjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth
your while, after every force has failed you, to re|treat
under the &s;helter of argument and per&s;ua&s;ion?
Or can you think that we, with nearly half your
army pri&s;oners, and in alliance with France, are to
be begged or threatened into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by a
piece of paper? But as commi&s;&s;ioners, at a hun|dred
pounds &s;terling a week each, you conceive
your&s;elves bound to do &s;omething, and the genius

<P>For my own part I have not put pen to paper
the&s;e &s;everal months. Convinced of your &s;uperio|rity
by the i&s;&s;ue of every campaign, I was inclined
to hope, that that which all the re&s;t of the world
now &s;ee, would become vi&s;ible to you, and there|fore
felt unwilling to ruffle your temper by fretting
you with repetitions and di&s;coveries. There have
been intervals of he&s;itation in your conduct, from
which it &s;eemed a pity to di&s;turb you, and a cha|rity
to leave you to your&s;elves. You have often
&s;topt, as if you intended to think, but your
thoughts have ever been too early or too late.</P>

There was a time when Britain di&s;dained to an|&s;wer,
and even to hear a petition from America.
That time is pa&s;t, and &s;he, in her turn, is petitioning
our acceptance. We now &s;tand on higher ground,
and offer her peace; and the time will come, when
&s;he, perhaps in vain, will a&s;k it from us. The latter
ca&s;e is as probable as the former ever was. She
cannot refu&s;e to acknowledge our independence
with greater ob&s;tinacy than &s;he before refu&s;ed to
repeal her laws; and if America alone could bring
her to the one, united with France &s;he will re|duce
her to the other. There is &s;omething in
ob&s;tinacy which differs from every other pa&s;&s;ion,
whenever it fails it never recovers, but either breaks
like iron, or crumbles &s;ulkily away like a fractured
arch. Mo&s;t other pa&s;&s;ions have their periods of
fatigue and re&s;t; their &s;ufferings and their cure;
but ob&s;tinacy has no re&s;ource, and the fir&s;t wound
is mortal. You have already begun to give it
up, and you will, from the natural con&s;truction
of the vice, find your&s;elves both obliged and
inclined to do &s;o.</P>
<P>If you look back you &s;ee nothing but lo&s;s
and di&s;grace. If you look forward, the &s;ame
&s;cene continues, and the clo&s;e is an impenetrable
gloom. You may plan and execute little mi&s;|chiefs,
but are they worth the expence they co&s;t
you, or will &s;uch partial evils have any effect
<PB N="175" REF="177">
on the general cau&s;e? Your expedition to Egg-Harbour,
will be felt at a di&s;tance like an at|tack
upon a hen-roo&s;t, and expo&s;e you in Eu|rope
with a &s;ort of childi&s;h phren&s;y. It is well
worth while to keep an army to protect you in
writing proclamations, or to get once a year
into winter quarters? Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing your&s;elves of
towns is not conque&s;t, but convenience, and in
which you will, one day or the other, be tre|panned.
Your retreat from Philadelphia was
only a timely e&s;cape, and your next expedition
may be le&s;s fortunate.</P>
<P>It would puzzle all the politicians in the univer&s;e
to conceive what you &s;tay for, or why you &s;hould
have &s;taid &s;o long. You are pro&s;ecuting a war
in which you confe&s;s you have neither object
nor hope, and that conque&s;t, could it be ef|fected,
would not repay the charges: In the mean
while, the re&s;t of your affairs are running into
ruin, and a European war kindled again&s;t you.
In &s;uch a &s;ituation, there is neither doubt or
difficulty; the fir&s;t rudiments of rea&s;on will de|termine
the choice, for if peace can be pro|cured
with more advantages than even a con|que&s;t

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the People of England.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;tages in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;erious life
in which to amu&s;e is cruel, but to deceive is
to de&s;troy; and it is of little con&s;equence in the
conclu&s;ion, whether men deceive them&s;elves or &s;ub|mit
by a kind of mutual con&s;ent, to the impo&s;itions
of each other. That England has been long under
the influence of delu&s;ion or mi&s;take, needs no other
proof than the unexpected and wretched &s;ituation
&s;he is now involved in: And &s;o powerful has been
the influence, that no provi&s;ion was ever made or
thought of again&s;t the misfortune, becau&s;e the po&s;|&s;ibility
of its happening was never conceived.</P>
<P>The general and &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance of Ame|rica,
the conque&s;t of Burgoyne, and a war with
France, were treated in parliament as the dreams
of a di&s;contented oppo&s;ition, or a di&s;tempered ima|gination.
They were beheld as objects unworthy
of a &s;erious thought, and the bare intimation of
<PB N="178" REF="180">
them afforded the mini&s;try a triumph of laughter.
Short triumph indeed! For every thing which has
been predicted has happened, and all that was pro|mi&s;ed
have failed. A long &s;eries of politics &s;o re|markably
di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of misfor|tunes,
without one alleviating turn, mu&s;t certainly
have &s;omething in it &s;y&s;tematically wrong. It is
&s;ufficient to awaken the mo&s;t credulous into &s;u&s;pi|cion,
and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate into thought. Either the
means in your power are in&s;ufficient, or the mea|&s;ures
ill-planned; either the execution has been
bad, or the thing attempted impracticable; or to
&s;peak more emphatically, either you are not able,
or Heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you
have not conquered us? Who, or what has pre|vented
you? You have had every opportunity
you could de&s;ire, and &s;uccceded to your utmo&s;t
wi&s;h in every preparatory means. Your fleets and
armies have arrived in America without an acci|dent.
No uncommon misfortune hath intervened.
No foreign nation hath interfered until the time
you had allotted for victory was pa&s;t. The oppo|&s;ition
either in or out of parliament, neither di&s;con|certed
your mea&s;ures, retarded or dimini&s;hed your
force. They only foretold your &s;ate. Every mi|ni&s;terial
&s;cheme was carried with as high a hand as
if the whole nation had been unanimous. Every
thing wanted was a&s;ked for, and every thing a&s;ked
<PB N="179" REF="181">
for was granted. A greater force was not within the
compa&s;s of your abilities to &s;end, and the time you
&s;ent it was, of all others, the mo&s;t favourable.
You were then at re&s;t with the whole world be&s;ide.
You had the range of every court in Europe uncon|tradicted
by us. You amu&s;ed us with a tale of
commi&s;&s;ioners of peace, and under that di&s;gui&s;e
collected a numerous army and came almo&s;t unex|pectedly
upon us. The force was much greater
than we looked for; and that which we had to op|po&s;e
it with was unequal in numbers, badly armed
and poorly di&s;ciplined; be&s;ides which, it was em|bodied
only for a &s;hort time, and expired within
a few months after your arrival. We had govern|ments
to form; mea&s;ures to concert; an army to
rai&s;e and train, and every nece&s;&s;ary article to im|port
or to create. Our non-importation &s;cheme had
exhau&s;ted our &s;tores, and your command by &s;ea,
intercepted our &s;upplies. We were a people un|known,
and unconnected with the political world,
and &s;trangers to the di&s;po&s;ition of foreign powers.
Could you po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h for a more favorable con|junction
of circum&s;tances? Yet all the&s;e have hap|pened
and pa&s;&s;ed away, and, as it were, left you
with a laugh. They are likewi&s;e events of &s;uch an
original nativity as can never happen again, unle&s;s
a new world &s;hould ari&s;e from the ocean.</P>
<P>If any thing can be a le&s;&s;on to pre&s;umption,
&s;urely the circum&s;tances of this war will have their
<PB N="180" REF="182">
effect. Had Britain been defeated by any Euro|pean
power, her pride would have drawn con&s;ola|tion
from the importance of her conquerors; but in
the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;he is excelled by tho&s;e &s;he affected
to de&s;pi&s;e, and her own opinion retorting on her&s;elf,
become an aggravation of her di&s;grace. Misfor|tune
and experience are lo&s;t upon mankind, when
they produce neither reflection nor reformation.
Evils, like poi&s;ons, have their u&s;es, and there are
di&s;ea&s;es which no other remedy can reach. It has
been the crime and folly of England to &s;uppo&s;e
her&s;elf invincible, and that, without acknowledging
or perceiving that a full third of her &s;trength was
drawn from the country &s;he is now at war with.
The arm of Britain has been &s;poken of as the arm
of the Almighty, and &s;he has lived of late, as if &s;he
thought the whole world created for her diver&s;ion.
Her politics, in&s;tead of civilizing, has tended to
brutalize mankind, and under the vain unmeaning
title of "Defender of the Faith," &s;he has made
war, like an Indian, again&s;t the religion of huma|nity.
Her cruelties in the Ea&s;t Indies, will NEVER,
NEVER be forgotten; and, it is &s;omewhat re|markable,
that the produce of that ruined country,
tran&s;ported to America, &s;hould there kindle up a
war, to puni&s;h the de&s;troyer. The chain is conti|nued,
though with a kind of my&s;terious uniformity,
both in the crime and the puni&s;hment. The latter
<PB N="181" REF="183">
runs parallel with the former; and time and fate
will give it a perfect illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Where information is withheld, ignorance be|comes
a rea&s;onable excu&s;e; and one would charita|bly
hope, that the people of England do not encou|rage
cruelty from choice, but from mi&s;take. Their
reclu&s;e &s;ituation, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, pre&s;erves
them from the calamities of war, and keeps them
in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies.
They &s;ee not, therefore they feel not. They tell
the tale that is told them, and believe it, and ac|cu&s;tomed
to no other news than their own, they re|ceive
it, &s;tript of its horrors, and prepared for the
palate of the nation, through the channel of the
London Gazette. They are made to believe
that their generals and armies differ from tho&s;e of
other nations, and have nothing of rudene&s;s or bar|barity
in them. They &s;uppo&s;e them what they
wi&s;h them to be. They feel a di&s;grace in thinking
otherwi&s;e, and naturally encourage the belief from
a partiality to them&s;elves. There was a time when
I felt the &s;ame prejudices, and rea&s;oned from the
&s;ame errors; but experience, &s;ad and painful expe|rience,
has taught me better. What the conduct
of former armies was, I know not, but what the
conduct of the pre&s;ent is, I well know. It is low,
cruel, indolent, and pro&s;&s;igate: and had the people
of America no other cau&s;e for &s;eparation than what
<PB N="182" REF="184">
the army has occa&s;ioned, that alone is cau&s;e
enough.</P>
<P>The field of politics in England is far more ex|ten&s;ive
than that of news. Men have a right to rea|&s;on
for them&s;elves, and though they cannot contra|dict
the intelligence in the London Gazette, they
can frame upon it what &s;entiments they plea&s;e.
But the misfortune is, that a general ignorance has
prevailed over the whole nation re&s;pecting Ameri|ca.
The mini&s;try and the minority have both been
wrong. The former was always &s;o; the latter,
only lately &s;o. Politics to be executively right,
mu&s;t have a unity of means and time, and a defect
in either overthrows the whole. The mini&s;try re|jected
the plans of the minority while they were
practicable, and joined in them, when they became
impracticable. From wrong mea&s;ures, they got
into wrong time, and have now completed the
circle of ab&s;urdity by clo&s;ing it upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It was my fate to come to America a few months
before the breaking out of ho&s;tilities. I found the
di&s;po&s;ition of the people &s;uch, that they might have
been led by a thread, and governed by a reed.
Their &s;u&s;picion was quick and penetrating, but
their attachment to Britain was ob&s;tinate, and it
was, at that time, a kind of trea&s;on to &s;peak again&s;t
it. They di&s;liked the mini&s;try, but they e&s;teemed
the nation. Their idea of grievance operated
without re&s;entment, and their &s;ingle object was re|conciliation,
<PB N="183" REF="185">
Bad as I believed the mini&s;try to be,
I never conceived them capable of a mea&s;ure &s;o
ra&s;h and wicked as the commencing of ho&s;tilities;
much le&s;s did I imagine the nation would en|courage
it. I viewed the di&s;pute as a kind of law|&s;uit,
in which I &s;uppo&s;ed the parties would find a
way either to decide or &s;ettle it. I had no thoughts
of independence, or of arms. The world could
not then have per&s;uaded me, that I &s;hould be ei|ther
a &s;oldier or an author. If I had any talents
for either, they were buried in me, and might ever
have continued &s;o, had not the nece&s;&s;ity of the
times dragged and driven them into action. I had
formed my plan of life, and conceiving my&s;elf hap|py,
wi&s;hed every body el&s;e &s;o. But when the
country into which I had ju&s;t put my foot, was &s;et
on fire about my ears, it was time to &s;tir. It
was time for every man to &s;tir. Tho&s;e who had
been long &s;ettled and had &s;omething to defend;
tho&s;e who had ju&s;t come had &s;omething to pur&s;ue;
and the call, and the concern was equal and univer|&s;al.
For in a country where all men were once ad|venturers,
the difference of a few years in their arri|val,
could make none in their right.</P>
<P>The breaking out of ho&s;tilities, opened a new
&s;u&s;picion in the politics of America, which, though
at that time very rare, has been &s;ince proved to be
very right. What I allude to, is, "A &s;ecret and
fixt determination in the Briti&s;h cabinet to annex
<PB N="184" REF="186">
America to the crown of England as a conquered
country." If this be taken as the object, then the
whole line of conduct pur&s;ued by the mini&s;try,
though ra&s;h in its origin, and ruinous in its con&s;e|quences,
is neverthele&s;s uniform and con&s;i&s;tent in
its parts. It applies to every ca&s;e, and re&s;olves
every difficulty. But if taxation, or any thing el&s;e
taken in its room, then there is no proportion be|tween
the object and the charge. Nothing but the
whole &s;oil and property of the country can be
placed as a po&s;&s;ible equivalent again&s;t the millions
which the mini&s;try expended. No taxes rai&s;ed in
America could po&s;&s;ibly repay it. A revenue of
two millions &s;terling a year, would not di&s;charge
the &s;um and intere&s;t accumulated thereon, in twenty
years.</P>
<P>Reconciliation never appears to have been the
wi&s;h or the object of admini&s;tration, they looked on
conque&s;t as certain and infallible, and under that
per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ought to drive the Americans into what
they might &s;tile, a general rebellion, and then
cru&s;hing them with arms in their hands, reap the
rich harve&s;t of a general confi&s;cation, and &s;ilence
them for ever. The dependants at court were too
numerous to be provided for in England. The
market for plunder in the Ea&s;t Indies were over;
and the profligacy of government required that a
a new mine &s;hould be opened, and that mine,
could be no other than America conquered and
<PB N="185" REF="187">
forfeited. They had no where el&s;e to go. Every
other channel was drained; and extravagance with
the thir&s;t of a drunkard, was gaping for &s;upplies.</P>
<P>If the mini&s;try deny this to have been their plan,
it becomes them to explain what was their plan.
For either they have abu&s;ed us in coveting pro|perty
they never laboured for, or they have abu&s;ed
you in expending an amazing &s;um upon an incom|petent
object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,
could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by
arms; and any kind of formal obedience which
America could have made, would have weighed
with the lightne&s;s of a laugh again&s;t &s;uch a load of
expence. It is, therefore, mo&s;t probable, that the
mini&s;try will at la&s;t ju&s;tify their policy by their di&s;|hone&s;ty,
and openly declare, that their original de|&s;ign
was conque&s;t: And in this ca&s;e, it well becomes
the people of England, to con&s;ider how far the na|tion
would have been benefited by the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In a general view, there are few conque&s;ts that
repay the charge of making them, and mankind
are pretty well convinced, that it can never be
worth their while to go to war for profit &s;ake. If
they are made war upon, their country invaded, or
their exi&s;tence at &s;take, it is their duty to defend
and pre&s;erve them&s;elves, but in every other light,
and from every other cau&s;e, is war inglorious and
dete&s;table. But to return to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion&mdash;</P>
<P>When conque&s;ts are made of foreign countries,
it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the COMMERCE and DO|MINION
<PB N="186" REF="188">
of the country which made them are
extended. But this could neither be the object
nor the con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent war. You en|joyed
the whole commerce before. It could re|ceive
no po&s;&s;ible addition by a conque&s;t, but on
the contrary, mu&s;t dimini&s;h as the inhabitants were
reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the
DOMINION over the country which you u&s;ed
to have, and had no complaint to make again&s;t her
for breach of any part of the compact between you
and her, or contending again&s;t any e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;|tom,
commercial, political or territorial. The
country and commerce were both your own when
you BEGAN to conquer, in the &s;ame manner
and form as they had been your own an hundred
years before. Nations have &s;ometimes been in|duced
to make conque&s;ts for the &s;ake only of re|ducing
the power of their enemies, or bringing it
to a balance with their own. But this could be no
part of your plan. No foreign authority was
claimed here, neither was any &s;uch authority &s;u&s;|pected
by you, or acknowledged, or imagined by
us. What then, in the name of heaven, could
you go to war for? or what chance could you
po&s;&s;ibly have in the event, but either to hold the
&s;ame country which you held before, and that in a
much wor&s;e condition, or to lo&s;e with an amazing
expence, what you might have retained without a
farthing charges.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
War never can be the intere&s;t of a trading nation,
any more than quarrelling can be profitable to a
man in bu&s;ine&s;s. But to make war with tho&s;e
who trade with us, is like &s;etting a bull-dog upon
a cu&s;tomer at the &s;hop door. The lea&s;t degree
of common &s;en&s;e &s;hews the madne&s;s of the latter,
and it will apply with the &s;ame force of conviction
to the former. Piratical nations, having neither
commerce or commodities of their own to lo&s;e,
may make war upon all the world, and lucratively
find their account in it. But it is quite otherwi&s;e
with Britain. For, be&s;ides the &s;toppage of trade in
time of war, &s;he expo&s;es more of her own property
to be lo&s;t, than &s;he has the chance of taking from
others. Some mini&s;terial gentlemen in parliament
have mentioned the greatne&s;s of her trade, as an
apology for the greatne&s;s of her lo&s;s. This is mi&s;e|rable
politics indeed! becau&s;e, it ought to have been
given as a rea&s;on for her not engaging in a war at
fir&s;t. The coa&s;t of America commands the We&s;t
India trade, almo&s;t as effectually as the coa&s;t of
Africa does that of the Streights, and England can
no more carry to the former, without the con&s;ent
of America, than &s;he can the latter without a Me|diterranean
pa&s;s.</P>
<P>In whatever light the war with America is con|&s;idered
upon commercial principles, it is evidently
the intere&s;t of the people of England not to &s;up|port
it; and why it has been &s;upported &s;o long
<PB N="188" REF="190">
again&s;t the cleare&s;t demon&s;trations of truth and na|tional
advantage, is to me, and mu&s;t be to all the
rea&s;onable world, a matter of actoni&s;hment. Per|haps,
it may be &s;aid, that I live in America, and
write this from intere&s;t. To this I reply, that my
principles are univer&s;al. My attachment is to all
the world, and not to any particular part, and if
what I advance is right, no matter where, or who
it comes from. We have given the proclamation
of your commi&s;&s;ioners a currency in our new&s;pa|pers,
and I have no doubt but you will give this a
place in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this part of my addre&s;s, I &s;hall
mention one more circum&s;tance in which I think
the people of England have been equally mi&s;taken;
and then proceed to other matter.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch an idea exi&s;ting in the world, as
that of NATIONAL HONOUR, and this
fal&s;ely under&s;tood, is oftentimes the cau&s;e of war. In
a chri&s;tian and philo&s;ophical &s;en&s;e, mankind &s;eem
to have &s;tood &s;till at individual civilization, and
to retain as nations, all the original rudene&s;s of
nature. Peace by treaty, is only a ce&s;&s;ation of vio|lence,
for a reformation of &s;entiment. It is a &s;ub|&s;titute
for a principle that is wanting, and ever will
be wanting till the idea of NATIONAL HO|NOUR
be rightly under&s;tood. As individuals,
we profe&s;s our&s;elves chri&s;tians, but as nations, we are
heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the
<PB N="189" REF="191">
late Admiral Saunders declaring in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, and that in the time of peace, "That
the city of Madrid laid in a&s;hes, was not a &s;ufficient
atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of
an Engli&s;h &s;loop of war." I do not a&s;k whether
this is chri&s;tianity or morality, I a&s;k whether it is
decency? whether it is proper language for a na|tion
to u&s;e? In private life we &s;hould call it by the
plain name of bullying, and the elevation of rank
cannot alter its character. It is, I think, exceed|ingly
ea&s;y to define, what ought to be under&s;tood by
national honour, for that which is the be&s;t character
for an individual, is the be&s;t character for a nation;
and wherever the latter exceeds or falls beneath
the former, there is a departure from the line of
true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have thrown out this ob&s;ervation with a de&s;ign
of applying it to Great Britain. Her idea of na|tional
honour &s;eems devoid of that benevolence of
heart, that univer&s;al expan&s;ion of philanthropy,
and that triumph over the rage of vulgar prejudice,
without which, man is inferior to him&s;elf, and a
companion of common animals. To know whom
&s;he &s;hall regard or di&s;like, &s;he a&s;ks what country
they are of, what religion they profefs, and what
property they enjoy. Her idea of national honour
&s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in national in&s;ult, and that to be a
great people, is to be neither a chri&s;tian, a philo&s;o|pher,
or a gentleman, but to threaten with the rude|ne&s;s
<PB N="190" REF="192">
of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a
lion. This, perhaps, may found har&s;h and un|courtly,
but it is too true, and the more is the pity.</P>
<P>I mention this only as her general character.
But towards America &s;he has ob&s;erved no character
at all, and de&s;troyed by her conduct what &s;he a&s;|&s;umed
in her title. She &s;et out with the title of Pa|rent
or Mother Country. The a&s;&s;ociation of ideas
which naturally accompany this expre&s;&s;ion, are
filled with every thing that is fond, tender, and
forbearing. They have an energy particular to
them&s;elves, and overlooking the accidental attach|ment
of common affections, apply with peculiar
&s;oftne&s;s to the fir&s;t feelings of the heart. It is a po|litical
term which every mother can feel the force
of, and every child can judge of. It needs no
painting of mine to &s;et it off, for nature only
can do it ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But has any part of your conduct to America
corre&s;ponded with the title you &s;et up? If in your
general national character you are unpoli&s;hed and
&s;evere, in this you are incon&s;i&s;tent and unnatural,
and you mu&s;t have exceeding fal&s;e notions of na|tional
honour, to &s;uppo&s;e that the world can admire
a want of humanity, or that national honour de|pends
on the violence of re&s;entment, the inflexibi|lity
of temper, or the vengeance of execution.</P>
<P>I would willingly convince you, and that with as
much temper as the times will &s;uffer me to do,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
that as you oppo&s;ed your own intere&s;t by quarrelling
with us, &s;o likewi&s;e your national honour, rightly
conceived and under&s;tood, was no ways called upon
to enter into a war with America; had you &s;tudied
true greatne&s;s of heart, the fir&s;t and faire&s;t ornament
of mankind, you would have acted directly con|trary
to all that you have done, and the world would
have a&s;cribed it to a generous cau&s;e; be&s;ides which,
you had (though with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this country)
&s;ecured a powerful name by the la&s;t war. You
were known and dreaded abroad; and it would have
been wi&s;e in you to have &s;uffered the world to have
&s;lept undi&s;turbed under that idea. It was to you a
force exi&s;ting without expence. It produced to you
all the advantages of real power, and you were
&s;tronger through the univer&s;ality of that charm
than any future fleets and armies may probably make
you. Your greatne&s;s was &s;o &s;ecured and inter|woven
with your &s;ilence, that you ought never to
have awakened mankind, and had nothing to do
but to be quiet. Had you been true politicians
you would have &s;een all this, and continued to draw
from the magic of a name, the force and authority,
of a nation.</P>
<P>Unwi&s;e as you were in breaking the charm, you
were &s;till more unwi&s;e in the manner of doing of
it. Sam&s;on only told the &s;ecret, but you have per|formed
the operation; you have &s;haven your own
head, and wantonly thrown away the locks. Ame|rica
<PB N="192" REF="194">
was the hair from which the charm was
drawn that infatuated the world. You ought to
have quarrelled with no power; but with her upon
no account. You had nothing to fear from any
conde&s;cen&s;ion you might make. You might have
humoured her, even if there had been no ju&s;tice in
her claims, without any ri&s;k to your reputation;
for Europe fa&s;cinated by your &s;ame, would have
a&s;cribed it to your benovolence, and America, in|toxicated
by the great, would have &s;lumbered in
her fetters.</P>
<P>But this method of &s;tudying the progre&s;s of the
pa&s;&s;ions, in order to a&s;certain the probable conduct
of mankind, is a philo&s;ophy in politics, which tho&s;e
who pre&s;ide at St. James's have no conception of.
They know no other influence than corruption,
and reckon all their probabilities from precedent.
A new ca&s;e, is to them a new world, and while
they are &s;eeking for a parallel, they get lo&s;t. The
talents of Lord Mansfield can be e&s;timated, at be&s;t,
no higher than tho&s;e of a &s;ophi&s;t. He under&s;tands
the &s;ubtleties, but not the elegance of nature? and
by continually viewing mankind through the cold
medium of the law, never thinks of penetrating
into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord
North, it is his happine&s;s to have in him more phi|lo&s;ophy
than &s;entiment, for he bears flogging like a
top, and &s;leeps the better for it. His puni&s;hment be|comes
his &s;upport, for while he &s;uffers the la&s;h for
his &s;ins, he keeps him&s;elf up by twirling about. In
<PB N="193" REF="195">
politics, he is a good arithmetician, and in every
thing el&s;e, nothing at all.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance which comes &s;o much
within Lord North's province as a financier, that I
am &s;urpri&s;ed it &s;hould e&s;cape him, which is the dif|ferent
abilities of the two countries in &s;upporting the
expence; for, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, England is
not a match for America in this particular. By a
curious kind of revolution in accounts, the people
of England &s;eem to mi&s;take their poverty for their
riches, that is, they reckon their national debt as
part of their national wealth. They make the &s;ame
kind of error which a man would do, who, after
mortgaging his e&s;tate, &s;hould add the money bor|rowed,
to the full value on the e&s;tate, in order to
count up his worth, and in this ca&s;e, he would con|ceit
that he got rich by running into debt. Ju&s;t
thus it is with England. The government owed
at the beginning of this war, one hundred and thirty
five millions &s;terling, and though the individuals
to whom it was due, had a right to reckon their
&s;hares as &s;o much private property, yet to the na|tion
collectively, it was &s;o much poverty. There
is as effectual limits to public debts as to private
ones, for when once the money borrowed is &s;o great
as to require the whole yearly revenue to di&s;charge
the intere&s;t thereon, there is an end to a farther bor|rowing;
in the &s;ame manner as when the intere&s;t
of a man's debts amounts to the yearly income of
<PB N="194" REF="196">
his e&s;tate, there is an end to his credit, This is
nearly the ca&s;e with England; the intere&s;t of her
pre&s;ent debt being at lea&s;t equal to one half of her
yearly revenue, &s;o that out of ten millions annually
collected by taxes, &s;he has but five &s;he can call her
own.</P>
<P>The very rever&s;e of this was the ca&s;e with Ame|rica;
&s;he began the war without any debt upon her,
and in order to carry it on, &s;he neither rai&s;ed mo|ney
by taxes, nor borrowed it upon intere&s;t, but
created it; and her &s;ituation at this time, continues
&s;o much the rever&s;e of yours, that taxing would
make her rich, whereas it would make you poor.
When we &s;hall have &s;unk the &s;um which we have
created, we &s;hall then be out of debt, be ju&s;t as
rich as when we began, and all the while we are
doing it, &s;hall feel no difference, becau&s;e the
value will ri&s;e, as the quantity decrea&s;es.</P>
<P>There was not a country in the world, &s;o capa|ble
of bearing the expence of a war, as America;
not only, becau&s;e, &s;he was not in debt when &s;he be|gan,
but becau&s;e the country is young, and capa|ble
of infinite improvement, and has an almo&s;t
boundle&s;s tract of new lands in &s;tore, whereas, Eng|land
has got to her extent of age and growth, and
has no unoccupied land, or property in re&s;erve.
The one is like a young heir, coming to a large im|proveable
e&s;tate, the other like an old man who&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="197">
chances are over, and his e&s;tate mortgaged for half
its worth.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd number of the Cri&s;is, which I find
has been re-publi&s;hed in England, I endeavoured to
to &s;et forth the impracticability of conquering
America. I &s;tated every ca&s;e, that I conceived
could po&s;&s;ibly happen, and ventured to predict its
con&s;equence. As my conclu&s;ions were drawn not
artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be
true. I was upon the &s;pot; knew the politics of
America, her &s;trength, and re&s;ources; and, by a
train of &s;ervices, the be&s;t in my power to render, was
honoured with the friend&s;hip of the congre&s;s&punc; the ar|my,
and the people. I con&s;idered the cau&s;e a ju&s;t one.
I know and feel it a ju&s;t one, and under that confi|dence
never made my own profit or lo&s;s an object.
My endeavour was to have the matter well under|&s;tood
on both &s;ides, and I conceived my&s;elf tender|ing
a general &s;ervice, by &s;etting forth to the one
the impo&s;&s;ibility of being conquered, and to the
other, the impo&s;&s;ibility of conquering. Mo&s;t of
the arguments made u&s;e of by the mini&s;try for &s;up|porting
the war, are the very arguments that ought
to have been u&s;ed again&s;t &s;upporting it; and the
plans, by which they thought to conquer, are the
very plans, in which they were &s;ure to be defeated.
They have taken every thing up at the wrong end.
Their ignorance is a&s;toni&s;hing, and were you in my
<PB N="196" REF="198">
&s;ituation you would &s;ee it. They may, perhaps,
have your confidence, but I am per&s;uaded, they
would make very indifferent members of congre&s;s.
I know what England is, and what America is,
and from the compound of knowledge, am better
enabled to judge of the i&s;&s;ue, than what the king or
any of his mini&s;ters can be.</P>
<P>In this number, I have endeavoured to &s;hew the
ill policy and di&s;advantages of the war. I believe
many of my remarks are new. Tho&s;e which are
not &s;o, I have &s;tudied to improve, and place in a
manner that may be clear and &s;triking, Your fail|ure,
is, I am per&s;uaded, as certain as fate. America
is above your reach. She is, at lea&s;t, your equal
in the world, and her independance, neither re&s;ts
upon your con&s;ent, or can be prevented by your
arms. In &s;hort, you &s;pend your &s;ub&s;tance in vain,
and impoveri&s;h your&s;elf without a hope.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e you had conquered America, what
advantage collectively or individually, as mer|chants,
manufacturers, or conquerors, could you
have looked for. This is an object you &s;eem
never to have attended to. Li&s;tening for the
&s;ound of victory, and led away by the phrenzy of
arms, you neglected to reckon either the co&s;t or
the con&s;equences. You mu&s;t all pay towards the
expence; the poore&s;t among you mu&s;t bear his
&s;hare, and it is both your right and duty to
weigh &s;eriou&s;ly the matter. Had America been
<PB N="197" REF="199">
conquered, &s;he might have been parcelled out in
grants to the favourites at court, but no &s;hare of
it would have fallen to you. Your taxes would not
have been le&s;&s;ened, becau&s;e, &s;he would have been in
no condition to have paid any towards your relief.
We are rich by a contrivance of our own, which
would have cea&s;ed, as &s;oon as you became ma&s;ters.
Our Paper money will be of no u&s;e in England, and
&s;ilver and gold we have none. In the la&s;t war you
made many conque&s;ts, but were any of your taxes
le&s;&s;ened thereby? On the contrary, were you not
taxed to pay for the charge of making them, and
have not the &s;ame been the ca&s;e in every war?</P>
<P>To the parliament, I beg to addre&s;s my&s;elf in a
particular manner They appear to have &s;uppo&s;ed
them&s;elves partners in the chace, and to have hunted
with the lion from an expectation of a right in
the booty; but in this, it is mo&s;t probably they
would, as legi&s;lators, have been di&s;appointed.
The ca&s;e is quite a new one, and many unfore|&s;een
difficulties would have ari&s;en thereon. The
parliament claimed a legi&s;lative right over America,
and the war originated from that pretence. But
the army is &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the crown, and
if America had been conquered through their
means, the claims of the legi&s;lature would have
been &s;uffocated in the conque&s;t. Ceded, or con|quered
countries, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be out of the au|thority
<PB N="198" REF="200">
of parliament. Taxation is exerci&s;ed over
them by prerogative and not by law. It was attempted
to be done in the Grenades a few years ago, and the
only rea&s;on why it was not done, was, becau&s;e, the
crown had made a prior relinqui&s;hment of its claim.
Therefore, parliament have been all this while &s;up|porting
mea&s;ures for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their au|thority,
in the i&s;&s;ue of which, they would have been
triumphed over by prerogative. This might have
opened a new and intere&s;ting oppo&s;ition between
the parliament and the crown. The crown would
have &s;aid that it conquered for it&s;elf, and that to
conquer for parliament was an unknown ca&s;e.
The parliament might have replied, that America
not being a foreign country, but a country in rebel|lion,
could not be &s;aid to be conquered, but reduced;
and thus continued their claim, by di&s;owning the
term. The crown might have rejoined, that how|ever
America might be con&s;idered at fir&s;t, &s;he be|came
foreign at la&s;t, by a declaration of indepen|dence,
and a treaty with France; and that her ca&s;e
being by that treaty, put within the law of nations,
was out of the law of parliament. The parlia|ment
might have maintained, that as their claim
over America had never been &s;urrendered, &s;o neither
could it be taken away. The crown might have
in&s;i&s;ted, that though the claim of parliament could
not be taken away yet being an inferior, might be
<PB N="199" REF="201">
&s;uperceded; and that, whether the claim was with|drawn
from the object, or the object taken from the
claim, the &s;ame &s;eparation en&s;ued; and that America
being &s;ubdued after a treaty with France, was to all
intents and purpo&s;es a regal conque&s;t, and of cour&s;e
the &s;ole property of the king. The parliament, as
the legal delegates of the people, might have con|tended
again&s;t the term "inferior," and re&s;ted the
ca&s;e upon the antiquity of power; and this would
have brought on a &s;et of very intere&s;ting and ration|al
que&s;tions.<LIST>

<P>In &s;hort, the contention about the dividend
might have di&s;tracted the nation; for nothing is
more common than to agree in the conque&s;t and
quarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a
happy circum&s;tance, that our &s;ucce&s;&s;es have pre|vented
the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>If the parliament had been thrown out in their
claim, which it is mo&s;t probable they would, the
nation likewi&s;e would have been thrown out in their
expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid
by the crown, without the parliament, the revenue
ari&s;ing therefrom, if any could have aro&s;e, would
not have gone into the exchequer, but into the
privy pur&s;e, and &s;o far from le&s;&s;ening the taxes,
would not even have been added to them, but
&s;erved only as pocket money to the crown. The
more I reflect on this matter, the more I am a&s;ton|i&s;hed
at the blindne&s;s and ill-policy of my coun|trymen,
who&s;e wi&s;dom &s;eems to operate without
di&s;cernment, and their &s;trength without an object.</P>
<P>To the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the
mercantile and manufacturing part thereof, I like|wi&s;e
pre&s;ent my addre&s;s. It is your intere&s;t to &s;ee
America an independent country, and not a con|quered
one. If conquered, &s;he is ruined; and if
ruined, poor; con&s;equently the trade will be a
trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent,
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;he flouri&s;hes, and from her flouri&s;hing, mu&s;t your
profits ari&s;e. It matters nothing to you, who go|verns
America, if your manufactures find a con|&s;umption
there. Some articles will con&s;equently
be obtained from other places, and right they &s;hould;
but the demand of others, will increa&s;e by the great
influx of inhabitants which a &s;tate of independence and
peace will occa&s;ion, and on the final event you may
be enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly
free, and ever will be &s;o. She will con&s;ign away
no part of it to any nation. She has not to her
friends, and certainly will not to her enemies,
though it is probable that your narrow-minded poli|ticians,
thinking to plea&s;e you thereby, may &s;ome
time or other make &s;uch an unnece&s;&s;ary propo&s;al.
Trade flouri&s;hes be&s;t when it is free, and it is weak
policy to attempt to fetter it. Her treaty with
France is on the mo&s;t liberal and generous princi|ples,
and the French in their conduct towards her,
have proved them&s;elves to be philo&s;ophers, politi|cians,
and gentlemen.</P>
<P>To the mini&s;try I likewi&s;e addre&s;s my&s;elf. You,
gentlemen, have &s;tudied the ruin of your country,
from which it is not within your abilities to re&s;cue
her. Your attempts to recover are as ridiculous as
your plans, which involved her, are dete&s;table.
The commi&s;&s;ioners being about to depart, will pro|bably
bring you this, and with it my &s;ixth number
to them; and in &s;o doing they carry back more
<PB N="202" REF="204">
COMMON SENSE than they brought, and you
will likewi&s;e have more than when you &s;ent them.</P>
<P>Having thus addre&s;&s;ed you &s;everally, I conclude
by addre&s;&s;ing you collectively. It is a long lane
that has no turning. A period of &s;ixteen years of
mi&s;conduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough
for any one nation to &s;uffer under; and upon a &s;up|po&s;ition
that war is not declared between France
and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before
you that will ea&s;ily lead you out of all your trou|bles.
It has been hinted before, and cannot be too
much attended to.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e America had remained unknown to
Europe till the pre&s;ent year, and that Mr. Banks
and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the
world, had made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of her in the
&s;elf &s;ame condition &s;he is now in, of arts, arms,
numbers, and civilization. What, I a&s;k, in that
ca&s;e, would have been your conduct towards her,
for THAT will point out what it ought to be
now? The problems and their &s;olutions are
equal, and the right line of the one is the parallel of
the other. The que&s;tion takes in every circum|&s;tance
that can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e. It reduces politics to
a &s;imple thought, and is moreover a mode of in|ve&s;tigation,
in which, while you are &s;tudying your
intere&s;t, the &s;implicity of the ca&s;e will cheat you into
good temper. You have nothing to do but to &s;up|po&s;e
you have found America, and &s;he appears
<PB N="203" REF="205">
found to your hand, and, while in the joy of your
heart you &s;tand &s;till to admire her, the path of
politics ri&s;es &s;traight before you.</P>
<P>Were I di&s;po&s;ed to paint a contra&s;t, I could ea&s;ily
&s;et off what you have done in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e
again&s;t what you would have done in THAT ca&s;e,
and, by ju&s;tly oppo&s;ing them, conclude a picture
that would make you blu&s;h. But, as when any of
the prouder pa&s;&s;ions are hurt, it is much better phi|lo&s;ophy
to let a man &s;lip into a good temper, than
to attack him in a bad one; for that rea&s;on, there|fore,
I only &s;tate the ca&s;e, and leave your&s;elves to
reflect upon it.</P>
<P>To go a little back into politics, it will be found
that the true intere&s;ts of Britain lay in propo&s;ing and
promoting the independence of America immedi|ately
after the la&s;t peace; for the expence which
Britain had then incurred by defending America,
as her own dominions, ought to have &s;hewn her the
policy and nece&s;&s;ity of changing the STILE of the
country, as the be&s;t probable method of preventing
future wars and expence, and the only method by
which &s;he could hold the commerce without the
charge of &s;overeignty. Be&s;ides which, the title
&s;he a&s;&s;umed of parent country, led to, and pointed
out, the propriety, wi&s;dom and advantage of a &s;epa|ration;
for as in private life, children grow into
men, and, by &s;etting up for them&s;elves, extend and
&s;ecure the intere&s;t of the whole family, &s;o in the
<PB N="204" REF="206">
&s;ettlement of colonies large enough to admit of
maturity, the &s;ame policy &s;hould be pur&s;ued, and
the &s;ame con&s;equences would follow. Nothing
hurts the affections both of parents and children
&s;o much, as living too clo&s;ely connected, and keep|ing
up the di&s;tinction too long. Domineering will
not do over tho&s;e, who by a progre&s;s in life are
become equal in rank to their parents, that is, when
they have families of their own; and though they
may conceive them&s;elves the &s;ubjects of their ad|vice,
will not &s;uppo&s;e them the objects of their
government. I do not, by drawing this parallel,
mean to admit the title of PARENT COUN|TRY,
becau&s;e, if due any where, it is due to Eu|rope
collectively, and the fir&s;t &s;ettlers from Eng|land
were driven here by pro&s;ecution. I mean
only to introduce the term for the &s;ake of policy,
and to &s;how from your title, the line of your
intere&s;t.</P>
<P>When you &s;aw the &s;tate of &s;trength and opu|lence,
and that by her own indu&s;try, which America
had arrived at, you ought to have advi&s;ed her to
have &s;et up for her&s;elf, and propo&s;ed an alliance of
intere&s;t with her, and, in &s;o doing, you would have
drawn, and that at her own expence, more real ad|vantage,
and more military &s;upplies and a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
both of &s;hips and men, than from any weak and
wrangling government you could exerci&s;e over her.
In &s;hort, had you &s;tudied only the dome&s;tic poli|tics
<PB N="205" REF="207">
of a family, you would have learned how to
govern the &s;tate; but, in&s;tead of this ea&s;y and na|tural
line, you flew out into every thing which was
wild and outrageous, till by following the pa&s;&s;ion
and &s;tupidity of the pilot, you wrecked the ve&s;&s;el
within &s;ight of the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Having &s;hown what you ought to have done, I
now proceed to &s;hew the rea&s;on why it was not done.
The caterpillar circle of the court, had an intere&s;t
to pur&s;ue di&s;tinct from, and oppo&s;ed to yours, for
though by the independence of America, and an
alliance therewith, the trade would have continued,
if not increa&s;ed, as in many articles neither country
can go to a better market, and, though by defend|ing
and protecting her&s;elf, &s;he would have been no
expence to you, and con&s;equently your national
charges would have decrea&s;ed, and your taxes might
have been proportionally le&s;&s;ened thereby; yet the
&s;triking off &s;o many places from the court calendar
was put in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of the nation.
The lo&s;s of thirteen government &s;hips, with their
appendages here and in England, is a &s;hocking
&s;ound in the ear of a hungry courtier. <HI>Your pre|&s;ent
king and mini&s;ter will be the ruin of you; and
you had better ri&s;k a revolution and call a congre&s;s,
than be thus led on from madne&s;s to de&s;pair, and
from de&s;pair to ruin. America has &s;et you the ex|ample,
and may you follow it and be &s;ree.</HI></P>

I now come to the la&s;t part&mdash;a war with France.
This is what no man in his &s;en&s;es will advi&s;e you to,

France will declare war again&s;t you, is not for me
in this place to mention, or to hint even if I knew
it, but it mu&s;t be madne&s;s in you to do it fir&s;t.
The matter is now come to a full cri&s;is, and peace
is ea&s;y, if willingly &s;et about. Whatever you may
think, France has behaved hand&s;omely to you.
She would have been unju&s;t to her&s;elf to have acted
otherwi&s;e than &s;he did; and having accepted our
offer of alliance, &s;he gave you genteel notice of it.
There was nothing in her conduct re&s;erved or in|delicate;
and, while &s;he announced her determina|tion
to &s;upport her treaty, &s;he left you to give the
fir&s;t offence. America, on her part, has exhibited
a character of firmne&s;s to the world. Unprepared
and unarmed, without form or government, &s;he
&s;ingly oppo&s;ed a nation that domineered over half
the globe. The greatne&s;s of the deed demands
re&s;pect; and, though you may feel re&s;entment, you
are compelled both to WONDER and AD|MIRE.</P>
<P>Here I re&s;t my arguments, and fini&s;h my ad|dre&s;s,
&s;uch as it is: it is a gift, and you are welcome.
It was always my de&s;ign to dedicate a CRISIS to
you, when the time &s;hould come that would pro|perly
MAKE IT A CRISIS; and when, likewi&s;e,
I &s;hould catch my&s;elf in a temper to write it, and
<PB N="207" REF="209">
&s;uppo&s;e you in a condition to read it. THAT
time is now arrived, and with it the opportunity of
conveyance. For the commi&s;&s;ioners&mdash;POOR
COMMISSIONERS! having proclaimed, that
"YET FORTY DAYS AND NINEVEH
SHALL BE OVERTHROWN" have waited
out the date, and, di&s;contented with their God, are
returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wi&s;h
them, is, that it may not WITHER about their
cars, and that they may not make their exit in the
belly of a whale.</P>

<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P.S. Though, in the tranquility of my mind, I
have concluded with a laugh, yet I have &s;omething
to mention to the COMMISSIONERS, which to
them is &s;erious, and worthy their attention. Their
authority is derived from an act of parliament,
which likewi&s;e de&s;cribes and LIMITS their OF|FICIAL
powers. Their commi&s;&s;ion, therefore,
is only a recital, and per&s;onal inve&s;titure, of tho&s;e
powers, or a nomination and de&s;cription of the per|&s;ons
who are to execute them. Had it contained
any thing contrary to, or gone beyond the line of,
the written law from which it is derived and by
which it is bound, it would, by the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution,
have been trea&s;on in the crown, and the
king been &s;ubject to an impeachment. He dared
not, therefore, put in his commi&s;&s;ion what you
<PB N="208" REF="210">
have put in your proclamation, that is, he dared not
have authori&s;ed you, in that commi&s;&s;ion, to burn
and de&s;troy, or to threaten to burn and de&s;troy, any
thing in America. You are both in the ACT, and
in the COMMISSION, &s;tiled COMMISSION|ERS
FOR RESTORING PEACE, and the
methods for doing it are there pointed out. Your
la&s;t proclamation is &s;igned by you, as commi&s;&s;ion|ers
UNDER THAT ACT. You make parlia|ment
the patron of its contents. Yet in the body
of it, you in&s;ert matters contrary both to the &s;pirit
and letter of the act, and what likewi&s;e your king
dared not have put in his commi&s;&s;ion to you. The
&s;tate of things in England, gentlemen, is too tick|li&s;h
for you to run hazards. You are ACCOUNT|ABLE
TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE EX|ECUTION
OF THAT ACT ACCORDING
TO THE LETTER OF IT. Your heads may
pay for breaking it, for you certainly have broke it
by exceeding it. And as a friend, who would wi&s;h
you to e&s;cape the paw of the lion as well as the
belly of the whale, I civilly hint to you, TO
KEEP WITHIN COMPASS.</P>
<P>Sir Harry Clinton, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is as ac|countable
as the re&s;t; though a general, he is like|wi&s;e
a commi&s;&s;ioner, acting under a &s;uperior autho|rity.
His fir&s;t obedience is to the act; and his plea
of being a general, will not and cannot clear him as
a commi&s;&s;ioner, for that would &s;uppo&s;e the crown,
<PB N="209" REF="211">
in its &s;ingle capacity, to have the power of di&s;pen|&s;ing
with a &s;ingle act of parliament. Your &s;itua|tions,
gentlemen, are nice and critical, and the
more &s;o, becau&s;e England is un&s;ettled. Take
heed! Remember the times of Charles the Fir&s;t!
For Laud and Stafford fell by tru&s;ting to a hope
like yours.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn you the danger of your pro|clamation,
I now &s;hew you the folly of it. The
means contradict the de&s;ign. You threaten to
lay wa&s;te, in order to render America a u&s;ele&s;s ac|qui&s;ition
of alliance to France. I reply, that the
more de&s;truction you commit, (if you could do it,)
the more valuable to France you make that alli|ance.
You can de&s;troy only hou&s;es and goods;
and by &s;o doing you encrea&s;e our demand upon
her for materials and merchandize; for the wants
of one nation, provided it has FREEDOM and
CREDIT, naturally produces riches to the other;
and as you can neither ruin the land, nor prevent
the vegetation, you would encrea&s;e the exportation
of our produce in payment, which, to her, would
be a new fund of wealth. In &s;hort, had you ca&s;t
about for a plan on purpo&s;e to enrich your enemies,
you could not have hit upon a better.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addre&s;&s;ed to the People of England.</HEAD>
<P>"TRUSTING, (&s;ays the king of England in
his &s;peech of November la&s;t) in the Divine
Providence, and in the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e, I am
firmly re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour,
and to make every exertion in order to compel
our enemies to equitable terms of peace and ac|commodation." To this declaration the United
States of America, and the confederated powers of
Europe, will reply, <HI>if Britain will have war, &s;he
&s;hall have enough of it.</HI></P>
<P>Five years have nearly elap&s;ed &s;ince the com|mencement
of ho&s;tilities, and every campaign, by
a gradual decay, has le&s;&s;ened your ability to conquer,
without producing a &s;erious thought on your con|dition
or your fate. Like a prodigal lingering in an
habitual con&s;umption, you feel the relics of life, and
mi&s;take them for recovery. New &s;chemes, like
<PB N="211" REF="213">
new medicines, have admini&s;tered fre&s;h hopes, and
prolonged the di&s;ea&s;e in&s;tead of curing it. A
change of generals, like a change of phy&s;icians,
&s;erved only to keep the flattery alive, and furni&s;h
new pretences for new extravagance.</P>
<P><HI>"Can Britain fail</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitehead's New Year's Ode, 1776.</NOTE><HI>?</HI>" Has been proudly a&s;ked
at the commencement of every enterprize, and
that <HI>"whatever &s;he wills is fate</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ode at the in&s;tallation of lord North, for chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford.</NOTE>," has been given
with the &s;olemnity of prophetic confidence, and
though the que&s;tion has been con&s;tantly replied to
by di&s;appointment, and the prediction fal&s;ified by
misfortune, yet &s;till the in&s;ult continued, and your
catalogue of national evils encrea&s;ed therewith.
Eager to per&s;uade the world of her power, &s;he con|&s;idered
de&s;truction as the mini&s;ter of greatne&s;s, and
conceived that the glory of a nation, like that of an
Indian, lay in the number of its &s;calps, and the mi|&s;eries
it inflicts.</P>
<P>Fire, &s;word and want, as far as the arms of Bri|tain
could extend them, have been &s;pread with
wanton cruelty along the coa&s;t of America; and
while you, remote from the &s;cene of &s;uffering, had
nothing to lo&s;e, and as little to dread, the informa|tion
reached you like a tale of antiquity, in which
the di&s;tance of time defaces the conception, and
<PB N="212" REF="214">
changes the &s;evere&s;t &s;orrows into conver&s;able amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>This makes the &s;econd paper, addre&s;&s;ed, per|haps
in vain, to the people of England. That ad|vice
&s;hould be taken, wherever example has
failed, or precept be regarded, where warning is
ridiculed, is like a picture of hope re&s;ting on de|&s;pair:
But when time &s;hall &s;tamp with univer&s;al
currency, the facts you have long encountered with
a laugh, and the irre&s;i&s;table evidence of accumula|ted
lo&s;&s;es, like the hand writing on the wall, &s;hall
add terror to di&s;tre&s;s, you will then, in a conflict of
&s;ufferings, learn to &s;ympathize with others by feel|ing
for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>The triumphant appearance of the combined
fleets in the channel, and at your harbour's mouth,
and the expedition of captain Paul Jones, on the
we&s;tern and ea&s;tern coa&s;t of England and Scotland,
will, by placing you in the condition of an endan|gered
country, read to you a &s;tronger lecture on the
calamities of inva&s;ion, and bring to your minds a
truer picture of promi&s;cuous di&s;tre&s;s, than the mo&s;t
fini&s;hed rhetoric can de&s;cribe, or the keene&s;t imagi|nation
can conceive.</P>
<P>Hitherto, you have experienced the expences,
but nothing of the mi&s;eries of war. Your di&s;ap|pointments
have been accompanied with no im|mediate
&s;uffering, and your lo&s;&s;es came to you only
by intelligence. Like fire at a di&s;tance, you heard
<PB N="213" REF="215">
not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you &s;aw
not the confu&s;ion. To you, every thing has been
foreign, but the taxes to &s;upport it. You knew
not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with an
armed enemy in the &s;treets. You were &s;trangers
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene of a family in flight, and
the thou&s;and re&s;tle&s;s cares, and tender &s;orrows that
ince&s;&s;antly aro&s;e. To &s;ee women and children
wandering in the &s;everity of winter with the broken
remains of a well furni&s;hed hou&s;e, and &s;eeking &s;helter
in every crib and hut, were matters you had no con|ception
of. You knew not what it was to &s;tand
by and &s;ee your goods chopt up for fuel, and your
beds ript to pieces to make packages for plunder.
The mi&s;ery of others, like a tempe&s;tuous night, ad|ded
to the plea&s;ures of your own &s;ecurity. You
even enjoyed the &s;torm, by contemplating the dif|ference
of conditions, and that which carried &s;or|row
into the brea&s;t of thou&s;ands, &s;erved but to
heighten in you a &s;pecies of tranquil pride.&mdash;Yet
the&s;e are but the fainter &s;ufferings of war, when
compared with carnage and &s;laughter, the mi&s;eries
of a military ho&s;pital, or a town in flames.</P>
<P>The people of America by anticipating di&s;tre&s;s,
had fortified their minds again&s;t every &s;pecies you
could inflict. They had re&s;olved to abandon their
homes, to re&s;ign them to de&s;truction, and to &s;eek
new &s;ettlements, rather than &s;ubmit. Thus fa|miliarized
to misfortune, before it arrived, they
<PB N="214" REF="216">
bore their portion with le&s;s regret: The ju&s;tne&s;s
of their cau&s;e, was a continual &s;ource of con&s;ola|tion,
and the hope of final victory, which never
left them, &s;erved to lighten the load, and &s;weeten
the cup allotted them to drink.</P>
<P>But when their &s;uffering &s;hall become yours, and
inva&s;ion be transferred to the invaders, you will
have neither an extended wilderne&s;s to fly to, their
cau&s;e to comfort you, nor their hopes to re&s;t
on. Di&s;tre&s;s with them was &s;harpened with no
&s;elf-reflection. They had not brought it on
them&s;elves. On the contrary, they had by every
proceeding endeavoured to avoid it, and had de|&s;cended
even below the mark of congre&s;&s;ional
character to prevent a war. The national honour,
or the advantages of independence, were matters,
which, at the commencement of the di&s;pute, they
had never &s;tudied, and it was only at the la&s;t moment
that the mea&s;ure was re&s;olved on. Thus circum|&s;tanced,
they naturally and con&s;cientiou&s;ly felt a de|pendance
upon Providence. They had a clear pre|tention
to it, and had they failed therein, infidelity
had gained a triumph.</P>
<P>But your condition is the rever&s;e of theirs.
Every thing you &s;uffer you have &s;ought; nay, had
you created mi&s;chiefs on purpo&s;e to inherit them,
you could not have &s;ecured your title by a firmer
deed. The world awakens with no pity at your
complaints. You felt none for others; you de|&s;erve
<PB N="215" REF="217">
none for your&s;elves. Nature doth not inter|e&s;t
her&s;elf in ca&s;es like yours, but, on the contrary,
turns from them with di&s;like, and abandons them
to puni&s;hment. You may now pre&s;ent memorials
to what court you plea&s;e, but &s;o far as America is
the object, none will li&s;ten. The policy of Europe,
and the propen&s;ity there isin every mind to curb
in&s;ulting ambition, and bring cruelty to judgment,
are unitedly again&s;t you; and where nature and in|tere&s;t
reinforces each other, the compact is too in|timate
to be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Make but the ca&s;e of others your own, and your
own theirs, and you will then have a clear idea of
the whole. Had France acted towards her colo|nies
as you have done, you would have branded
her with every epithet of abhorrence; and had you
like her, &s;tept in to &s;uccour a &s;truggling people, all
Europe mu&s;t have echoed with your own applau&s;es.
But entangled in the pa&s;&s;ion of di&s;pute, you &s;ee it
not as you ought, and form opinions thereon which
&s;uit with no intere&s;t but your own. You wonder
America does not ri&s;e in union with you to im|po&s;e
on her&s;elf a portion of your taxes, and
reduce her&s;elf to unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.
You are amazed that the &s;outhern powers of Europe
do not a&s;&s;i&s;t you in conquering a country, which is
afterwards to be turned again&s;t them&s;elves; and
that the northern ones do not contribute to rein&s;tate
you in America, who already enjoy the market for
<PB N="216" REF="218">
naval &s;tores by the &s;eparation. You &s;eem &s;urprized
that Holland does not pour in her &s;uccours, to
maintain you mi&s;tre&s;s of the &s;eas, when her own
commerce is &s;uffering by your act of navigation,
or that any country &s;hould &s;tudy her own intere&s;ts
while yours is on the carpet.</P>
<P>Such exce&s;&s;es of pa&s;&s;ionate folly, and unju&s;t, as
well as unwi&s;e re&s;entment, have driven you on,
like Pharoah, to unpitied mi&s;eries, and while
the importance of the quarrel &s;hall perpetuate your
di&s;grace, the flag of America will carry it round
the world. The natural feelings of every rational
being will take again&s;t you, and wherever the &s;tory
&s;hall be told, you will have neither excu&s;e nor con|&s;olation
left. With an un&s;paring hand, and an un&s;a|tiable
mind, you have havocked the world, both to
gain dominion, and to lo&s;e it; and while in a phrenzy
of avarice and ambition, the ea&s;t and the we&s;t are
doomed to tributary bondage, you rapidly earned
de&s;truction as the wages of a nation.</P>
<P>At the thoughts of a war at home, every man
among&s;t you ought to tremble. The pro&s;pect is far
more dreadful there than in America. Here the party
that was again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the continent,
were, in general, a kind of neutrals, who added
&s;trength to neither army. There does not exi&s;t a
being &s;o devoid of &s;en&s;e and &s;entiment as to covet
"UNCONDITIONAL SUBMISSION," and
therefore no man in America could be with you in
<PB N="217" REF="219">
principle. Several, might, from a cowardice of
mind, PREFER it to the hard&s;hips and dangers
of OPPOSING it; but the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition that
gave them &s;uch a choice, unfitted them to act either
for or again&s;t. But England is rent into parties, with
equal &s;hares of re&s;olution. The principle which
produced the war, divides the nation. Their ani|mo&s;ities
are in the highe&s;t &s;tate of fermentation, and
both &s;ides by a call of the militia are in arms. No
human fore&s;ight can di&s;cern, no conclu&s;ion can be
formed, what turn a war might take, if once &s;et on
by an inva&s;ion. She is not now in a fit di&s;po&s;ition
to make a common cau&s;e of her own affairs, and
having no conque&s;ts to hope for abroad, and nothing
but expences ari&s;ing at home, her every thing is
&s;taked upon a defen&s;ive combat, and the further
&s;he goes, the wor&s;e &s;he is off.</P>
<P>There are &s;ituations a nation may be in, in which
peace or war, ab&s;tracted from every other con&s;idera|tion,
may be politically right or wrong. When
nothing can be lo&s;t by a war, but what mu&s;t be lo&s;t
without it, war is then the policy of that country;
and &s;uch was the &s;ituation of America at the com|mencement
of ho&s;tilities; But when no &s;ecurity can
be gained by a war, but what may be accompli&s;hed
by a peace, the cafe becomes rever&s;ed, and &s;uch now
is the &s;ituation of England.</P>
<P>That America is beyond the reach of conque&s;t,
is a fact which experience has &s;hewn, and time con|firmed;
and this admitted, what, I a&s;k, is now the
<PB N="218" REF="220">
object of contention; If there be any honour in
pur&s;uing &s;elf-de&s;truction with inflexible pa&s;&s;ion: if
national &s;uicide be the perfection of national glory,
you may, with all the pride of criminal happine&s;s,
expire unenvied, and unrivalled.&mdash;But when the
tumult of war &s;hall cea&s;e, and the tempe&s;t of pre|&s;ent
pa&s;&s;ions be &s;ucceeded by calm reflection, or
when tho&s;e, who &s;urviving its fury, &s;hall inherit
from you, a legacy of debts and misfortunes, when
the yearly revenue &s;hall &s;carcely be able to di&s;charge
the intere&s;t of the one, and no po&s;&s;ible remedy be
left for the other: Ideas, far different to the pre|&s;ent,
will ari&s;e, and embitter the remembrance of
former follies. A mind di&s;armed of its rage, feels
no plea&s;ure in contemplating a frantic quarrel.
Sickne&s;s of thought, the &s;ure con&s;equence of con|duct
like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment, no
reli&s;h for re&s;entment; and though, like a man in a
fit, you feel not the injury of the &s;truggle, nor di&s;|tingui&s;h
between &s;trength and di&s;ea&s;e, the weakne&s;s,
will, neverthele&s;s, be proportioned to the violence
and the &s;en&s;e of pain, encrea&s;e with the recovery.</P>
<P>To what per&s;ons, or to who&s;e &s;y&s;tem of politics
you owe your pre&s;ent &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s, is a
matter of total indifference to America. They
have contributed, however unwillingly, to &s;et her
above them&s;elves; and &s;he, in the tranquillity of
conque&s;t, re&s;igns the enquiry. The ca&s;e now, is
not &s;o properly, who began the war, as who conti|nues
it. That there are men in all countries to
<PB N="219" REF="221">
whom a &s;tate of war is a mine of wealth, is a fact ne|ver
to be doubted. Characters like the&s;e, naturally
breed in the putrefaction of di&s;tempered times, and
after fattening on the di&s;ea&s;e, they peri&s;h with it,
or impregnated with the &s;tench, retreat into ob&s;cu|rity.</P>
<P>But there are &s;everal erroneous notions, to
which you likewi&s;e owe a &s;hare of your misfortunes,
and which, if continued, will only increa&s;e your
trouble and your lo&s;&s;es. An opinion hangs about
the gentlemen of the minority, that America would
reli&s;h mea&s;ures under THEIR admini&s;tration,
which &s;he would not from the pre&s;ent cabinet.
On this rock lord Chatham would have &s;plit had he
gained the helm, and &s;everal of his &s;urvivors are
&s;teering the &s;ame cour&s;e. Such di&s;tinctions in the
infancy of the argument, had &s;ome degree of foun|dation,
but they now &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than
to lengthen out a war, in which the limits of the
di&s;pute, being fixt by the fate of arms, and guaran|tied
by treaties, are not to be changed, or altered
by trivial circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try and many of the minority &s;acrifice
their time in di&s;puting on a que&s;tion, with which,
they have nothing to do, namely, whether America
&s;hall be independent or not? Whereas, the only
que&s;tion that can come under their determination,
is, whether they will accede to it or not? They
confound a military que&s;tion with a political one,
<PB N="220" REF="222">
and undertake to &s;upply by a vote, what they lo&s;t
by a battle. Say, &s;he &s;hall not be independent,
and it will &s;ignify as much, as if they voted again&s;t
a decree of fate, or &s;ay that &s;he &s;hall, and &s;he will
be no more independent than before. Que&s;tions,
which when determined, cannot be executed, &s;erve
only to &s;hew the folly of di&s;pute, and the weakne&s;s
of the di&s;putants.</P>
<P>From a long habit of calling America your own,
you &s;uppo&s;e her governed by the &s;ame prejudices
and conceits which govern your&s;elves. Becau&s;e
you have &s;et up a particular denomination of reli|gion
to the exclu&s;ion of all others, you imagine &s;he
mu&s;t do the &s;ame; and, becau&s;e you, with an
un&s;ociable narrowne&s;s of mind, have cheri&s;hed
again&s;t France and Spain, you &s;uppo&s;e her alliance
mu&s;t be defective in friend&s;hip. Copying her no|tions
of the world from you, &s;he formerly thought
as you in&s;tructed, but now feeling her&s;elf free, and
the prejudice removed, &s;he thinks, and acts upon a
different &s;y&s;tem. It frequently happens, that in
proportion as we are taught to di&s;like per&s;ons and
countries, not knowing why, we feel an ardour of
e&s;teem upon a removal of the mi&s;take: It &s;eems
as if &s;omething was to be made amends for, and
we eagerly give into every office of friend&s;hip, to
atone for the injury of the error.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">
But, perhaps, there is &s;omething in the extent
of countries, which, among the generality of peo|ple,
in&s;en&s;ibly communicates exten&s;ion of the mind.
The &s;oul of an i&s;lander in its native &s;tate, &s;eems
bounded by the foggy confines of the water's edge,
and all beyond, affords to him matters only for
profit or curio&s;ity&mdash;not for friend&s;hip. His i&s;land
is to him, his world, and fixt to that, his every
thing centers in it; while tho&s;e, who are inhabi|tants
of a continent, by ca&s;ting their eye over a
larger field, take in likewi&s;e a larger intellectual
circuit, and thus approaching nearer to an ac|quaintance
with the univer&s;e, their atmo&s;phere of
thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider
&s;pace. In &s;hort, our minds &s;eem to be mea&s;ured
by countries when we are men, as they are by
places, when we are children, and until &s;omething
happens to di&s;entangle us from the prejudice, we
&s;erve under it without perceiving it.</P>
<P>In addition to this, it may be remarked, that
men who &s;tudy any univer&s;al &s;cience, the principles
of which are univer&s;ally known or admitted, and
applied without di&s;tinction to the common benefit

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>No. X.</HEAD>
<P>HAD America pur&s;ued her advantages with
half the &s;pirit &s;he re&s;i&s;ted her misfortunes, &s;he
would, before now, have been a conquering,
and a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of
&s;oft tranquillity, &s;he re&s;ted on her hopes, and ad|ver&s;ity
only has convul&s;ed her into action. Whe|ther
&s;ubtlety or &s;incerity, at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t
year, induced the enemy to an appearance for
peace, is a point not material to know; it &s;uffi|cient
that we &s;ee the effects it has had on
our politics, and that we &s;ternly ri&s;e to re&s;ent the
delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The war, on the part of America, has been a
war of natural feelings. Brave in di&s;tre&s;s; &s;erene
in conque&s;t; drow&s;y while at re&s;t; and in every
&s;ituation generou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to peace. A danger|ous
calm, and a mo&s;t heightened zeal, have, as cir|cum&s;tances
varied, &s;ucceeded each other. Every
pa&s;&s;ion, but that of de&s;pair, has been called to a
tour of duty; and &s;o mi&s;taken has been the enemy,
<PB N="224" REF="226">
of our abilities and di&s;po&s;ition, that when &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed
us conquered, we ro&s;e the conquerors. The
exten&s;ivene&s;s of the United States, and the variety
of their re&s;ources; the univer&s;ality of their cau&s;e,
the quick operation of their feelings, and the &s;imi|larity
of their &s;entiments, have, in every trying &s;itu|ation,
produced <HI>a &s;omething,</HI> which favoured by
Providence, and pur&s;ued with ardour, has accom|pli&s;hed
in an in&s;tant the bu&s;ine&s;s of a campaign.
We have never deliberately &s;ought victory, but
&s;natched it; and bravely undone in an hour, the
plotted operations of a &s;ea&s;on,</P>
<P>The reported fate of Charle&s;town, like the mis|fortunes
of &s;eventy-&s;ix, has at la&s;t called forth a
&s;pirit, and kindled up a flame, which, perhaps, no
other event could have produced. If the enemy
has circulated a fal&s;hood, they have unwi&s;ely ag|gravated
us into life, and if they have told us a
truth, they have unintentionally done us a &s;ervice.
We were returning with folded arms from the fa|tigues
of war, and thinking and &s;etting lei&s;urely
down to enjoy repo&s;e. The dependance that has
been put upon Charle&s;town, threw a drow&s;ine&s;s over
America. We looked on the bu&s;ine&s;s done&mdash;
The conflict over&mdash;the matter &s;ettled&mdash;or that all
which remained unfini&s;hed would follow of it|&s;elf.
In this &s;tate of dangerous relax, expo&s;ed to
the poi&s;onous in&s;u&s;ions of the enemy, and having
<PB N="225" REF="227">
no common danger to attract our attention, we
were extingui&s;hing by &s;tages the ardour we began
with, and &s;urrendering by piece meals the virtue
that defended us.</P>
<P>Afflicting as the lo&s;s of Charle&s;town may be, yet
if it univer&s;ally rouze us from the &s;lumber of a
twelvemonths pa&s;t, and renew in us the &s;pirit of
former days, it will produce an advantage more
important than its lo&s;s. America ever <HI>is</HI> what &s;he
<HI>thinks</HI> her&s;elf to be. Governed by &s;entiment,
and acting her own mind, &s;he becomes, as &s;he
plea&s;es, the victor or the victim.</P>
<P>It is not the conque&s;t of towns, nor the acci|dental
capture of garri&s;ons, that can reduce a coun|try
&s;o exten&s;ive as this. The &s;ufferings of one part
can ever be relieved by the exertions of another,
and there is no &s;ituation the enemy can be in, that
does not afford to us the &s;ame advantages &s;he &s;eeks
her&s;elf. By dividing her force, &s;he leaves every
po&s;t attackable. It is a mode of war that carries
with it a confe&s;&s;ion of weakne&s;s, and goes on the
principle of di&s;tre&s;s, rather than conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The decline of the enemy is vi&s;ible, not only in
their operations, but in their plans; Charle&s;town
originally made but a &s;econdary object in the &s;y&s;|tem
of attack, and it is now become their princi|pal
one, becau&s;e they have not been able to &s;ucceed
el&s;ewhere. It would have carried a cowardly ap|pearance
<PB N="226" REF="228">
in Europe, had they formed their grand
expedition in &s;eventy-&s;ix, again&s;t a part of the con|tinent,
where there was no army, or not a &s;ufficient
one to oppo&s;e them; but failing year after year in
their impre&s;&s;ions here, and to the ea&s;tward and
northward, they de&s;erted their fir&s;t capital de&s;ign,
and prudently contenting them&s;elves with what
they can get, give a flouri&s;h of honour to conceal
di&s;grace.</P>
<P>But this piecemeal work is not conquering the
continent. It is a di&s;credit in them to attempt it,
and in us to &s;uffer it. It is now full time to put an
end to a war of aggravations, which, on one &s;ide,
has no po&s;&s;ible object, and on the other, has every
inducement which honour, intere&s;t, &s;afety and hap|pine&s;s
can in&s;pire. If we &s;uffer them much longer
to remain among us, we &s;hall become as bad as
them&s;elves. An a&s;&s;ociation of vices will reduce us
more than the &s;word. A nation hardened in the
practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by
it, than a young country newly corrupted. We
are not a match for them in the line of advantage|ous
guilt, nor they to us on the principles we bravely
&s;et out with. Our fir&s;t days were our days of honour.
They have marked the character of America
wherever the &s;tory of her wars are told; and con|vinced
of this, we have nothing to do, but wi&s;ely
and unitedly to tread the well known track.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">
The progre&s;s of a war is often as ruinous to indi|viduals,
as the i&s;&s;ue of it is to a nation; and it is
not only nece&s;&s;ary that our forces be &s;uch, that we
be conquerors in the end, but that by timely ex|ertions
we be &s;ecure in the interim. The pre&s;ent
campaign will afford an opportunity which has
never pre&s;ented it&s;elf before, and the preparations
for it are equally nece&s;&s;ary, whether Charl&s;town
&s;tand or fall. Suppo&s;e the fir&s;t, it is in that ca&s;e
only a failure of the enemy, not a defeat. All the
conque&s;t a be&s;ieged town can hope for, is, not to be
conquered; and compelling an enemy to rai&s;e the
&s;iege, is to the be&s;ieged a victory. But there mu&s;t
be a probability, amounting almo&s;t to certainty,
that would ju&s;tify a garri&s;on marching out to attack
a retreat. Therefore, &s;hould Charle&s;town not be
taken, and the enemy abandon the &s;iege, every
other part of the continent &s;hould prepare to meet
them; and on the contrary, &s;hould it be taken, the
&s;ame preparations are nece&s;&s;ary to balance the lo&s;s,
and put our&s;elves in a condition to co-operate with
our allies, immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>We are not now fighting our battles alone, as
we were in &s;eventy &s;ix. England, from a malici|ous
di&s;po&s;ition to America, has not only not declared
war again&s;t France and Spain, but the better to
pro&s;ecute her pa&s;&s;ions here, has afforded tho&s;e two
powers no military object, and avoids them, to
di&s;tre&s;s us. She will &s;uffer her We&s;t India i&s;lands
<PB N="228" REF="230">
to be over-run by France, and her &s;outhern &s;ettle|ments
taken by Spain, rather than quit the object
that gratifies revenge. This conduct, on the part
of Britain, has pointed out the propriety of France
&s;ending a naval and land force to co - operate
with America on the &s;pot. Their arrival cannot
be very di&s;tant, nor the ravages of the enemy long.
In the mean time the part nece&s;&s;ary to us needs no
illu&s;tration. The recruiting the army, and procu|ring
the &s;upplies, are the two things needful, and a
capture of either of the enemy's divi&s;ions, will re|&s;tore
to America peace and plenty.</P>
<P>At a cri&s;is, big, like the pre&s;ent, with expectation
and events, the whole country is called to unani|mity
and exertion. Not an ability ought now to
&s;leep, that can produce but a mite to the general good,
nor even a whi&s;per to pa&s;s that militates again&s;t it.
The nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and the importance of
the con&s;equences, admit no delay from a friend,
no apology from an enemy. To &s;pare now,
would be the height of extravagance, and to con|&s;ult
pre&s;ent ea&s;e, would be to &s;acrifice it, perhaps,
for ever.</P>
<P>America, rich in patrioti&s;m and produce, can want
neither men nor &s;upplies, when a &s;erious nece&s;&s;ity
call them forth. The &s;low operation of taxes,
owing to the exten&s;ivene&s;s of collection, and their
depreciated value before they arrived in the trea|&s;ury,
have in many in&s;tances, thrown a burthen
<PB N="229" REF="231">
upon government, which has been artfully inter|preted
by the enemy into a general decline through|out
the country. Yet this, inconvenient as it may
at fir&s;t appear, is not only remediable, but may be
turned to an immediate advantage; for it makes
no real difference, whether a certain number of
men, or company of militia (and in this country,
every man is a militia man) are directed by law to
&s;end a recruit at their own expence, or whether a
tax is laid on them for that purpo&s;e, and the man
hired by government afterwards. The fir&s;t, if
there is any difference, is both cheape&s;t and be&s;t,
becau&s;e it &s;aves the expence which would attend
collecting it as a tax, and brings the man &s;ooner into
the field, than the modes of recruiting formerly
u&s;ed. And on this principle, a law has been pa&s;&s;ed
in this &s;tate, for recruiting two men from each com|pany
of militia, which will add upwards of a thou|&s;and
to the force of the country.</P>
<P>But the flame, which has broke forth in this city
&s;ince the report from New York, of the lo&s;s of
Charle&s;town, not only does honour to the place,
but, like the blaze of &s;eventy-&s;ix, will kindle into
action the &s;cattered &s;parks throughout America.&mdash;
The valour of a country, may be learned by the
bravery of its &s;oldiery, and the general ca&s;t of its in|habitants,
but confidence of &s;ucce&s;s is be&s;t di&s;covered
by the active mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by men of property;
and when the &s;pirit of enterprize becomes &s;o uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="230" REF="232">
as to act at once on all ranks of men, a war
may then, and not till then, be &s;tiled truly popular.</P>
<P>In &s;eventy-&s;ix, the ardour of the enterpri&s;ing
part was con&s;iderably checked, by the real revolt of
&s;ome, and the coolne&s;s of others. But in the pre|&s;ent
ca&s;e, there is a firmne&s;s in the &s;ub&s;tance and pro|perty
of the country to the public cau&s;e. An a&s;&s;o|ciation
has been entered into by the merchants,
trade&s;men, and the principal inhabitants of this
city, to receive and &s;upport the new &s;tate money at
the value of gold and &s;ilver; a mea&s;ure, which,
while it does them honour, will likewi&s;e contribute
to their intere&s;t, by rendering the operations of the
campaign convenient and effectual.</P>
<P>Neither has the &s;pirit of exertion &s;topt here. A
voluntary &s;ub&s;cription is likewi&s;e began, to rai&s;e a
fund of hard money to be given as bounties to fill
up the full quota of the Penn&s;ylvania line. It has
been the remark of the enemy, that every thing
in America has been done by the force of govern|ment;
but when &s;he &s;ees individuals throwing in
their voluntary aids, and facilitating the public mea|&s;ures
in concert with the e&s;tabli&s;hed powers of the
country, it will convince her that the cau&s;e of
America &s;tands not on the will of a few, but on the
broad foundation of property and popularity.</P>
<P>Thus aided, and thus &s;upported, di&s;affection
will decline, and the withered head of tyranny ex|pire
<PB N="231" REF="233">
in America. The ravages of the enemy will
be &s;hort and limited, and like all their former ones,
will produce a victory over them&s;elves.</P>

<P>&rindx; At the time of writing this number of the
Cri&s;is, the lo&s;s of Charle&s;town, though believed by
&s;ome, was more confidently di&s;believed by others.
But there ought to be no longer a doubt on the
matter. Charle&s;town is gone, and I believe, for
the want of a &s;ufficient &s;upply of provi&s;ions. The
man that does not now feel for the honour of the

<HEAD>THE
CRISIS
EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(On the Subject of Taxation.)</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;it down and think &s;eriou&s;ly on
the affairs of America, but the original principles
on which &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, and the glow and ardour
they in&s;pired, will occur like the undefaced remem|brance
of a lovely &s;cene. To trace over in imagi|nation
the purity of the cau&s;e, the voluntary &s;acri|fices
made to &s;upport it, and all the various turnings
of the war in its defence, is at once both paying and
receiving re&s;pect. The principles de&s;erve to be
remembered, and to remember them rightly, is
repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. In this indulgence of gene|rous
recollection, we become gainers by what we
&s;eem to give, and the more we be&s;tow the richer we
become.</P>
<P>So exten&s;ively right was the ground on which
America proceeded, that it not only took in every
ju&s;t and liberal &s;entiment which could impre&s;s the
heart, but made it the direct intere&s;t of every cla&s;s
and order of men to defend the country. The war,
<PB N="233" REF="235">
on the part of Britain, was originally a war of covet|ou&s;ne&s;s.
The &s;ordid, and not the &s;plendid pa&s;&s;ions
gave it being. The fertile fields, and pro&s;perous
infancy of America, appeared to her as mines for
tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and di&s;re|garding
the indu&s;try that had enriched it, thir&s;ted for
the honey. But in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of her affairs,
the violence of temper is added to the rage of ava|rice;
and therefore, that, which at the fir&s;t &s;etting
out proceeded from purity of principle and public
intere&s;t, is now heightened by all the obligations of
nece&s;&s;ity; for it requires but little knowledge of hu|man
nature, to di&s;cern what would be the con&s;e|quence,
were America again reduced to the &s;ubjec|tion
of Britain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands
of an incen&s;ed, imperious, and rapacious conqueror,
is an engine of dreadful execution, and woe be to
that country over which it can be exerci&s;ed. The
names of whig and tory would then be &s;unk in the
general term of rebel, and the oppre&s;&s;ion, whatever
it might be, would, with very few in&s;tances of ex|ception,
light equally on all.</P>
<P>Britain did not go to war with America for the
&s;ake of dominion, becau&s;e &s;he was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
neither was it for the exten&s;ion of trade and com|merce,
becau&s;e &s;he had monopolized the whole
and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to
extingui&s;h what <HI>&s;he</HI> might call rebellion, becau&s;e,
before &s;he began, no re&s;i&s;tance exi&s;ted. It could
<PB N="234" REF="236">
then be from no other motive than avarice, or a
de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the &s;ame
taxes in America as are paid in England (which,
as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, are above eleven times
heavier than the taxes we now pay for the pre&s;ent
year, 1780), or in the &s;econd in&s;tance, to confi&s;cate
the whole property of America, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance
and conque&s;t of the latter, of which &s;he had then
no doubt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew what the taxes in
England are, and what the yearly expence of the
pre&s;ent war is to her,&mdash;What the taxes of this
country amount to, and what the annual expence of
defending it effectually will be to us; and &s;hall en|deavour
conci&s;ely, to point out the cau&s;e of our
difficulties, and the advantages on one &s;ide, and the
con&s;equences on the other, in ca&s;e we do, or do
not put our&s;elves in an effectual &s;tate of defence. I
mean to be open, candid and &s;incere. I &s;ee a uni|ver&s;al
wi&s;h to expel the enemy from the country, a

more vigour, and my intention is, to &s;hew, as

<PB N="236" REF="238">
annually to pay the intere&s;t of the national debt
contracted by former wars, and the remaining &s;um
of &s;ix millions &s;ix hundred and forty two thou&s;and
&s;ix hundred pounds was applied to defray the
yearly expence of government, the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the army and navy, placemen and pen&s;ion|ers,
&amp;c. con&s;equently the whole of her enormous
taxes being thus appropriated, &s;he had nothing to
&s;pare out of them towards defraying the expences
of the pre&s;ent war, or any other. Yet had &s;he not
been in debt at the beginning of the war, as we
were not, and like us had only a land, and not a na|val
war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven
millions and a half pounds &s;terling would then defray
all her annual expences of war and government
within each year.</P>
<P>But this not being the ca&s;e with her, &s;he is ob|liged
to borrow about ten million pounds &s;terling
<PB N="237" REF="239">
yearly, to pro&s;ecute the war &s;he is now engaged in
(this year &s;he borrowed twelve), and lay on new
taxes to di&s;charge the intere&s;t: and allowing that
the pre&s;ent war has co&s;t her only fifty millions &s;ter|ling,
the intere&s;t thereon at five per cent, will be
two millions and an half, therefore the amount of
her taxes now mu&s;t be fourteen millions, which, on
an average, is not le&s;s than forty &s;hillings &s;terling
per head, men, women and children throughout the
nation. Now as this expence of fifty millions was
borrowed on the hopes of conquering America,
and as it was Avarice which fir&s;t induced her to
commence the war, how truly wretched and deplo|rable
would the condition of this country be, were
&s;he, by her own remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, to &s;uffer an enemy of
&s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o circum&s;tanced, to reduce
her to &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated the number of &s;ouls in Ameri|ca
to be three millions, and by a calculation I have
made, which I have every rea&s;on to believe is &s;uf|ficiently
right, the whole expence of the war and the
&s;upport of the &s;everal governments, may be defray|ed
for two million pounds &s;terling, annually; which,
on an average, is thirteen &s;hillings and four pence
per head, men, women, and children, and the peace
e&s;tabli&s;hment at the end of the war, will be but three
quarters of a million, or five &s;hillings &s;terling per
<PB N="238" REF="240">
head. Now, throwing out of the que&s;tion every
thing of honour, principle, happine&s;s, freedom and
reputation in the world, and taking it up on the
&s;imple ground of intere&s;t, I put the following ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Britain was to conquer America, and
as conquerors, was to lay her under no other con|ditions
than to pay the &s;ame proportions towards
her annual revenue which the people of England,
pay; our &s;hare in that ca&s;e, would be &s;ix mil|lion
pounds &s;terling yearly; can it then be a que&s;|tion,
whether it is be&s;t to rai&s;e two millions to de|fend
the country and govern it our&s;elves, and
only three quarters of a million afterwards, or pay
&s;ix millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy
govern it.</P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that conquerors would chu&s;e
to put them&s;elves in a wor&s;e condition than what
they granted to the conquered. In England, the
tax on rum is five &s;hillings and one penny &s;terling
per gallon, which is one &s;ilver dollar and fourteen
coppers. Now would it not be laughable to ima|gine,
that after the expence they have been at, they
would let either whig or tory in America drink it
cheaper than them&s;elves. Coffee, which is &s;o con|&s;iderable
an article of con&s;umption and &s;upport here,
is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price
between five and &s;ix &s;hillings &s;terling a pound, and
a penalty of fifty pounds &s;terling on any per&s;on de|tected
<PB N="239" REF="241">
in roa&s;ting it in his own hou&s;e. There is
&s;carce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear,
or enjoy, that is not there loaded with a tax; even
the light from heaven is only permited to &s;hine
into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence &s;ter|ling
per window annually; and the humble&s;t drink
of life, &s;mall beer, cannot there be purcha&s;ed with|out
a tax of nearly two coppers a gallon, be&s;ides a
heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops
before it is brewed, exclu&s;ive of a land tax on the
earth which produces them. In &s;hort, the condi|tion
of that country in point of taxation is &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ive,
the number of her poor &s;o great, and the
extravagance and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the court &s;o enor|mous,
that were they to effect a conque&s;t of Ame|rica,
it is then only that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of America
would begin. Neither would it &s;ignify any thing
to a man whether he be whig or tory. The peo|ple
of England, and the mini&s;try of that country
know us by no &s;uch di&s;tinctions. What they want
is clear &s;olid revenue, and the modes they would
take to procure it, would operate alike on all.
Their manner of rea&s;oning would be &s;hort, becau&s;e
they would naturally infer, that if we were able to
carry on a war of five or &s;ix years again&s;t them, we
were able to pay the &s;ame taxes which they do.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated that the expence of conduct|ing
the pre&s;ent war, and the government of the &s;e|veral
&s;tates, may be done for two millions &s;terling,
<PB N="240" REF="242">
and the e&s;tabli&s;hment in time of peace, for three
quarters of a million<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have made the calculations in &s;terling, becau&s;e it is a rate generally known in all the &s;tates, and becau&s;e, likewi&s;e, it admits of an ea&s;y compari&s;on between our expences to &s;upport the war, and tho&s;e of the enemy. Four &s;ilver dollars and an half is one pound &s;terling, and three pence over.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to navy matters, they flouri&s;h &s;o well, and
are &s;o well attended in the hands of individuals,
that I think it con&s;i&s;tent on every principle of real
u&s;e and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard mo|ney,
(keeping only three or four packets) and ap|ply
it to promote the &s;ervice of the army. We
&s;hall not have a &s;hip the le&s;s; the u&s;e of them, and
the benefit from them, will be greatly increa&s;ed, and
their expence &s;aved. We are now allied to a for|midable
naval power, from whom we derive the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a navy. And the line in which we
can pro&s;ecute the war, &s;o as to reduce the common
enemy, and benefit the alliance mo&s;t effectually,
will be, by attending clo&s;ely to the land &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I e&s;timate the charge of keeping up, and main|taining
an army, officering them, and all expences
included, &s;ufficient for the defence of the country,
to be equal to the expence of forty thou&s;and men at
thirty pounds &s;terling per head, which is one million
two hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243">
I likewi&s;e allow four hundred thou&s;and pounds
for continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>And four hundred thou&s;and pounds for the &s;up|port
of the &s;everal &s;tate governments, the amount
will then be,

<P>I take the proportion of this &s;tate, Penn&s;ylvania,
to be an eighth part of the thirteen United States,
the quota then for us to rai&s;e will be two hundred
and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; two hundred
thou&s;and of which, will be our &s;hare for the &s;up|port
and pay of the army and continental expences
at home and abroad, and fifty thou&s;and pounds for
the &s;upport of &s;tate government.</P>
<P>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in
which the rai&s;ing &s;uch a &s;um will fall, I make the
following calculation:</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania contains three hundred and &s;eventy
five thou&s;and inhabitants, men, women, and chil|dren,
which is likewi&s;e an eighth of the whole in|habitants
of the whole United States: therefore
two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling to
be rai&s;ed among three hundred and &s;eventy five
thou&s;and per&s;ons, is, on an average, thirteen &s;hil|lings
<PB N="242" REF="244">
and four pence &s;terling, per head, per annum,
or &s;omething more than one &s;hilling &s;terling per
month. And our proportion of three quarters of
a million, for the government of the country, in
time of peace, will be ninety three thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and fifty pounds &s;terling, fifty thou&s;and of
which will be for the government expences of the
&s;tate, and forty three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty
pounds for continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The peace e&s;tabli&s;hment then, will, on an ave|rage,
be five &s;hillings &s;terling per head. Whereas,
was England now to &s;top, and the war to cea&s;e, her
peace e&s;tabli&s;hment would continue the &s;ame as it
is now, viz. forty &s;hillings per head; therefore, was
our taxes nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war as much
per head, as her's now is, and the difference to be
only whether we &s;hould, at the end of the war, pay
at the rate of five &s;hillings per head, or forty
&s;hillings per head, the ca&s;e needs no thinking of.
But as we can &s;ecurely defend and keep the coun|try
for one third le&s;s than what our burthen would
be if it was conquered, and &s;upport the govern|ments
afterwards for one eighth of what Britain
would levy on us, and, could I find a mi&s;er who&s;e
heart never felt the emotion of a &s;park of princi|ciple,
even that man, uninfluenced by every love,
but the love of money, and capable of no attach|ment
but to his intere&s;t, would, and mu&s;t, from the
frugality which governs him, contribute to the de|fence
<PB N="243" REF="245">
of the country, or he cea&s;es to be a mi&s;er, and
becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it,
every thing that can ornament mankind; when
the line of our intere&s;t becomes the line of
our happine&s;s; when all that can cheer and
animate the heart? when &s;en&s;e of honour, fame,
character at home and abroad, are interwoven, not
only with the &s;ecurity, but the increa&s;e of property;
there exi&s;ts not a man in America, unle&s;s he be a
hired emi&s;&s;ary, who does not &s;ee that his good is
connected with keeping up a &s;ufficient defence.</P>
<P>I do not imagine that an in&s;tance can be pro|duced
in the world, of a country putting her&s;elf to
&s;uch an amazing charge to conquer and en&s;lave
another, as Britain has done. The &s;um is too great
for her to think of with any tolerable degree of
temper; and when we con&s;ider the burthen &s;he
&s;u&s;tains, as well as the di&s;po&s;ition &s;he has &s;hewn,
it would be the height of folly in us, to &s;uppo&s;e
that &s;he would not reimbur&s;e her&s;elf by the mo&s;t
rapid means, had &s;he once more America within
her power. With &s;uch an oppre&s;&s;ion of expence,
what would an empty conque&s;t be to her? what
relief under &s;uch circum&s;tances could &s;he derive
from a victory without a prize! It was money, it
was revenue &s;he fir&s;t went to war for, and nothing
but <HI>that</HI> would &s;atisfy her. It is not the nature of
avarice to be &s;atisfied with any thing el&s;e. Every
pa&s;&s;ion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode
of operation. Many of them are temporary and
<PB N="244" REF="246">
fluctuating; they admit of ce&s;&s;ation and variety.
But avarice is a fixed uniform pa&s;&s;ion. It neither
abates of its vigour, nor changes its object; and the
rea&s;on why it does not, is founded on the nature
of things, for wealth has not a rival, where avarice
is a ruling pa&s;&s;ion. One beauty may excel another,
and extingui&s;h from the mind of a man the pictured
remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the
phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot &s;eek a new
object, becau&s;e there is not another in the world.</P>
<P>I now pa&s;s on to &s;hew the value of the pre&s;ent
taxes, and compare them with the annual expence;
but this I &s;hall preface with a few explanatory re|marks.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tinct things which make the
payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and
real value of the &s;um to be paid, and the other is,
the &s;carcity of the thing in which the payment is to
be made; and, although the&s;e appear to be one
and the &s;ame, they are in &s;everal in&s;tances, not
only different, but the difficulty &s;prings from differ|ent
cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a tax was to be laid, equal to one half
of what a man's yearly income is, &s;uch a tax could
not be paid, becau&s;e the property could not be
&s;pared; and on the other hand, &s;uppo&s;e a very
trifling tax was laid to be collected in <HI>pearls,</HI> &s;uch
a tax likewi&s;e could not be paid, becau&s;e it could
not be had. Now any per&s;on may &s;ee that the&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="247">
are di&s;tinct ca&s;es, and the latter of them is a repre|&s;entation
of ours.</P>
<P>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the
former, that is, from the real value or weight of
the tax is evident at fir&s;t view, to any per&s;on who
will con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>The amount of the quota of taxes for this &s;tate,
for the pre&s;ent year, 1780, (and &s;o on in proportion
for every other &s;tate) is twenty millions of dollars,
which at &s;eventy for one, is but &s;ixty four thou&s;and
two hundred and eighty pounds three &s;hillings &s;ter|ling,
and on an average, is no more than three &s;hil|lings
and five pence &s;terling, per head, per annum,
per man, woman, and child, or 3&frac25; pence per head,
per month. Now here is a clear po&s;itive fact, that
cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the
difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in
it&s;elf it is a trifle, and far from being adequate to
our quota of the expence of the war. The quit-rents
of one penny &s;terling per acre, on only one
half the &s;tate, come to upwards of fifty thou&s;and
pounds, which is almo&s;t as much as all the taxes of
the pre&s;ent year, and as tho&s;e quit-rents made no
part of the taxes then paid, and are now di&s;conti|nued,
the quantity of money drawn for public &s;er|vice
this year, exclu&s;ive of the militia fines, which
I &s;hall take notice of in the proce&s;s of this work, is
le&s;s than what was paid, and payable in any year
preceding the revolution, and &s;ince the la&s;t war;
<PB N="246" REF="248">
what I mean, is, that the quit-rents and taxes taken
together, came to a larger &s;um then, than the
pre&s;ent taxes without the quit-rents do now.</P>
<P>My intention by the&s;e arguments and calcula|tions
is, to place the difficulty to the right cau&s;e,
and &s;hew that it does not proceed from the weight
or worth of the tax, but from the &s;carcity of the
medium in which it is paid: and to illu&s;trate this
point &s;till farther, I &s;hall now &s;hew, that if the tax of
twenty millions of dollars, was of four times the real
value it now is, or nearly &s;o, which would be about
two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling,
and would be our full quota, that this &s;um would
have been rai&s;ed with more ea&s;e, and le&s;s felt, than
the pre&s;ent &s;um of only &s;ixty four thou&s;and two hun|dred
and eighty pounds.</P>
<P>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a
tax in money ari&s;es from the quantity of money that
can be &s;pared out of trade.</P>
<P>When the emi&s;&s;ions &s;topt, the continent was
left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two hundred millions of dollars,
perhaps as equally di&s;per&s;ed as it was po&s;&s;ible for
trade to do it. And as no more was to be i&s;&s;ued,
the ri&s;e or fall of prices could neither increa&s;e nor
dimini&s;h the quantity. It therefore remained the
&s;ame through all the fluctuations of trade and
exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="249">
Now had the exchange &s;tood at twenty for one,
which was the rate Congre&s;s calculated upon when
they quoted the &s;tates the latter end of la&s;t year,
trade would have been carried on for nearly four
times le&s;s money than it is now, and con&s;equently
the twenty millions would have been &s;pared with
much greater ea&s;e, and when collected would have
been of almo&s;t four times the value they now are.
And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be
ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required
for trade would be more than at &s;ixty or &s;eventy
for one, and though the value of them would be
le&s;s, the difficulty of &s;paring the money out of
trade would be greater. And on the&s;e facts and ar|guments
I re&s;t the matter, to prove that it is not
the want of property, but the &s;carcity of the me|dium,
by which the proportion of property for tax|ation
is to be mea&s;ured out, that makes the embar|ra&s;&s;ment
we lie under. There is not money
enough, and what is equally as true, the people
will not let there be money enough.</P>
<P>While I am on the &s;ubject of the currency, I
&s;hall offer one remark, which will appear true to
every body, and can be accounted for by nobody,
which is, that the better the times were, the wor&s;e the
money grew; and the wor&s;e the times were, the
better the money &s;tood. It never depreciated by
any advantage obtained by the enemy. The trou|bles
<PB N="248" REF="250">
of &s;eventy-&s;ix, and the lo&s;s of Philadelphia, in
&s;eventy-&s;even, made no &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on
it, and every one knows, that the &s;urrender of
Charle&s;town did not produce the lea&s;t alteration in
the rate of exchange, which, for long before, and
for more than three months after, &s;tood at &s;ixty for
one. It &s;eems, as if the certainty of its being our
own, made us carele&s;s of its value, and that the mo&s;t
di&s;tant thoughts of lo&s;ing it, made us hug it the
clo&s;er, like &s;omething we were loth to part with;
or that we depreciate it for our pa&s;time, which,
when called to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s by the enemy, we leave off
to renew again at our lei&s;ure. In &s;hort, our good
luck &s;eems to break us, andour bad make us whole.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing on from this digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall now en|deavour
to bring into one view, the &s;everal parts I
have already &s;tated, and form thereon &s;ome propo|&s;itions,
and conclude.</P>
<P>I have placed before the reader, the average tax
per head, paid by the people in England; which is
forty &s;hillings &s;terling.</P>
<P>And I have &s;hewn the rate on an average per
head, which will defray all the expence of the war
to us, and &s;upport the &s;everal governments, without
running the country into debt, which is thirteen
&s;hillings and four pence.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn what the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment may
be conducted for, viz: an eighth part of what it
would be if under the government of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251">
And I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn what the average per
head of the pre&s;ent taxes are, namely, three &s;hillings
and five pence &s;terling, or 3&frac25; per month; and that
their whole yearly value, in &s;terling, is only &s;ixty
four thou&s;and two hundred and eighty pounds.
Whereas, our quota, to keep the payments equal
with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thou&s;and
pounds. Con&s;equently, there is a deficiency of one
hundred and eighty-five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
twenty pounds, and the &s;ame proportion of defect,
according to the &s;everal quotas, happens in every
other &s;tate. And this defect is the cau&s;e why the
army has been &s;o indifferently fed, cloathed and
paid. It is the cau&s;e, likewi&s;e, of the nervele&s;s
&s;tate of the campaign, and the in&s;ecurity of
the country. Now, if a tax equal to thir|teen
and four pence per head, will remove all
the&s;e difficuties, make people &s;ecure in their homes,
leave them to follow the bu&s;ine&s;s of their &s;tores and
farms unmole&s;ted, and not only keep out, but drive
out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect
of rai&s;ing this &s;um will let them in, and produce the
evils which might be prevented&mdash;on which
&s;ide, I a&s;k, does the wi&s;dom, intere&s;t and policy lie;
Or, rather, would it not be an in&s;ult to rea&s;on to
put the que&s;tion? The &s;um, when proportioned out
according to the &s;everal abilities of the people, can
<PB N="250" REF="252">
hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins
hundreds of families.</P>
<P>Look at the de&s;truction done in this city. The
many hou&s;es totally de&s;troyed, and others damaged;
the wa&s;te of fences in the country round it, be&s;ides
the plunder of furniture, forage and provi&s;ion. I
do not &s;uppo&s;e that half a million &s;terling would
rein&s;tate the &s;ufferers; and does this, I a&s;k, bear any
proportion to the expence that would make us &s;e|cure.
The damage, in an average, is at lea&s;t ten
pounds &s;terling per head, which is as much as thir|teen
&s;hillings and four pence per head comes to for
fifteen years. The &s;ame has happened on the fron|tiers,
and in the Jer&s;eys, New York, and other
places where the enemy has been&mdash;Carolina and
Georgia are likewi&s;e &s;uffering the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>That the people generally do not under&s;tand the
in&s;ufficiency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evi|dent,
not only from common ob&s;ervation, but
from the con&s;truction of &s;everal petitions, which
were pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;embly of this &s;tate, again&s;t
the recommendation of Congre&s;s of the 18th of
March la&s;t, for taking up and funding the pre&s;ent
currency at forty for one, and i&s;&s;uing new money in
its &s;tead. The prayer of the petition was, <HI>That the
currency might be appreciated by taxes</HI> (meaning the
pre&s;ent taxes) <HI>and that part of the taxes be applied
to the &s;upport of the army, if the army could not be
<PB N="251" REF="253">
otherwi&s;e &s;upported.</HI> Now it could not have
been po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a petition to have been pre|&s;ented,
had the petitioners known, that &s;o far from
<HI>part</HI> of the taxes being &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of
the army, the <HI>whole</HI> of them falls three fourihs &s;hort
of the year's expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to propo&s;e methods by which
a &s;ufficiency of money may be rai&s;ed, I &s;hall take a
&s;hort view of the general &s;tate of the country.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the weight of the war, the ra|vages
of the enemy, and the ob&s;tructions &s;he has
thrown in the way of trade and commerce, &s;o &s;oon
does a young country outgrow misfortune, that
America has already &s;urmounted many that once
heavily oppre&s;&s;ed her. For the fir&s;t year or two of
the war, we were &s;hut up within our ports, &s;carce
venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our
rivers are beautified with large and valuable ve&s;&s;els,
our &s;tores filled with merchandize, and the produce
of the country has a ready market, and an advanta|geous
price. Gold and &s;ilver, that for a while
&s;eemed to have retreated again within the bowels
of the earth, is once more ri&s;en into circulation,
and every day adds new &s;trength to trade com|merce,
and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by
Sir John Dalrymple, and di&s;per&s;ed in America in
the year 1775, he a&s;&s;erted, that, <HI>two twenty gun
&s;hips, nay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>tenders of tho&s;e &s;hips, &s;tationed
between Albemarle &s;ound, and Che&s;apeak bay would
<PB N="252" REF="254">
&s;hut up the trade of America for</HI> 600 <HI>miles.</HI> How
little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities
of America!</P>
<P>While under the government of Britain, the
trade of this country was loaded with re&s;trictions.
It was only a few foreign ports we were allowed to
&s;ail to. Now it is otherwi&s;e; and allowing that
the quantity of trade is but half what it was before
the war, the ca&s;e mu&s;t &s;hew the va&s;t advantage of
an open trade, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent quantity under
her re&s;trictions, could not &s;upport it&s;elf; from
which I infer, that if half the quantity without the
re&s;trictions can bear it&s;elf up nearly, if not quite, as
well as the whole when &s;ubject to them, how pro&s;|perous
mu&s;t the condition of America be when the
whole &s;hall return open with all the world. By
trade, I do not mean the employment of a mer|chant
only, but the whole intere&s;t and bu&s;ine&s;s of
the country taken collectively.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much my intention, by this publica|cation,
to propo&s;e particular plans for rai&s;ing mo|ney,
as it is to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity and the advanta|ges
to be derived from it. My principle de&s;ign is
to form the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to &s;uch mea|&s;ures
which I am fully per&s;uaded is their intere&s;t
and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force
to accompli&s;h them than the force of being felt.
But as every hint may be u&s;eful, I &s;hall throw out
<PB N="253" REF="255">
a &s;ketch, and leave others to make &s;uch improve|ments
upon it as to them may appear rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The annual &s;um wanted is two millions, and the
average rate in which it falls is thirteen &s;hillings and
four pence per head.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then, that we rai&s;e half the &s;um, and
&s;ixty thou&s;and pounds over. The average rate
thereof, will be &s;even &s;hillings per head.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, we &s;hall have half the &s;upply
we want, and an annual fund of &s;ixty thou&s;and
pounds, whereon to borrow the other million; be|cau&s;e
&s;ixty thou&s;and pounds is the intere&s;t of a
million at &s;ix per cent. and if at the end of another
year, we &s;hould be obliged by the continuance of
the war, to borrow another million, the taxes will be
increa&s;ed to &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, and thus
for every million borrowed, and an additional tax
equal to &s;ixpence per head mu&s;t be levied.</P>
<P>The &s;um then to be rai&s;ed next year, will be one
million and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds; one half of
which I would propo&s;e &s;hould be rai&s;ed by duties
on imported goods and prize goods, and the other
half by a tax on landed property and hou&s;es, or &s;uch
other means as each &s;tate may devi&s;e,</P>
<P>But as the duties on imports and prize goods mu&s;t
be the &s;ame in all the &s;tates, therefore the rate per
cent, or what other form the duty &s;hall be laid, mu&s;t
be a&s;certained and regulated by Congre&s;s, and
ingrafted in that form into the law of each &s;tate;
and the monies ari&s;ing therefrom carried into the
<PB N="254" REF="256">
trea&s;ury of each &s;tate. The duties to be paid in
gold or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>There are many rea&s;ons why a duty on imports
is the mo&s;t convenient duty or tax that can be col|lected;
one of which is, becau&s;e the whole is pay|able
in a few places in a country, and it likewi&s;e ope|rates
with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and equality, becau&s;e as
every one pays in proportion to what he con&s;umes,
&s;o people, in general, con&s;ume in proportion to
what they can afford, and therefore the tax is regu|lated
by the abilities which every man &s;uppo&s;es
him&s;elf to have, or in other words every man be|comes
his own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and pays by a little at a time,
when it &s;uits him to buy. Be&s;ides, it is a tax
which people may pay or let alone, by not con&s;u|ming
the articles; and though the alternative may
have no influence on their conduct, the power of
choo&s;ing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For
my own part, it would be a &s;atisfaction to me, was
there a duty on all &s;orts of liquors during the war,
as in my idea of things, it would be an addition to
the plea&s;ure of &s;ociety, to know, that when the
health of the army goes round, a few drops from
every gla&s;s become theirs. How often have I
heard an emphatical wi&s;h, almo&s;t accompanied with
a tear, "<HI>Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had
&s;ome of this!</HI>" Why then need we &s;uffer under
<PB N="255" REF="257">
a fruitle&s;s &s;ympathy, when there is a way to enjoy
both the wi&s;h and the entertainment at once?</P>
<P>But the great national policy of putting a duty
upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign
trade in our own hands, or draws &s;omething for the
defence of the country from every foreigner who
participates it with us.</P>
<P>Thus much for the fir&s;t half of the taxes, and as
each &s;tate will be&s;t devi&s;e means to rai&s;e the other
half, I &s;hall confine my remarks to the re&s;ources of
this &s;tate:</P>
<P>The quota then of this &s;tate, of one million and
and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, will be one hundred
and thirty three thou&s;and two hundred and fifty
pounds, the half of which, is &s;ixty &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix
hundred and twenty five pounds; and &s;uppo&s;ing
one fourth part of Penn&s;ylvania inhabited, then a
tax of one bu&s;hel of wheat on every twenty acres
of land, one with another, would produce the &s;um,
and all the pre&s;ent taxes to cea&s;e. Whereas the
tythes of the bi&s;hops and clergy in England, ex|clu&s;ive
of the taxes, are upwards of half a bu&s;hel of
wheat on <HI>every &s;ingle</HI> acre of land, good and bad,
throughout the nation.</P>
<P>In the former part of this paper, I mentioned
the militia fines, but re&s;erved &s;peaking to the mat|ter,
which I &s;hall now do: The ground I &s;hall
put it upon is, that two millions &s;terling a year, will
<PB N="256" REF="258">
&s;upport a &s;ufficient army, and all the expences of
war and government, without having recour&s;e to
the inconvenient method of continually calling men
from their employments, which of all others is the
mo&s;t expen&s;ive and the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial. I con&s;i|der
the revenues created by taxes as the fir&s;t and
principal thing, and fines only as &s;econdary and ac|cidental
things. It was not the intention of the
militia law to apply the miltia fines to any thing el&s;e
but the &s;upport of the militia, neither do they pro|duce
any revenue to the &s;tate, yet the&s;e fines amount
to more than all the taxes; for taking the mu&s;ter-roll
to be &s;ixty thou&s;and men, the fine on forty thou|&s;and
who may not attend, will be &s;ixty thou&s;and
pounds &s;terling, and tho&s;e who mu&s;ter, will give up
a portion of time equal to half that &s;um, and if the
the eight cla&s;&s;es &s;hould be called within the year,
and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining
forty thou&s;and, would amount to &s;eventy two mil|lions
of dollars, be&s;ides the fifteen &s;hillings on every
hundred pounds property, and the charge of &s;even
and a half per cent for collecting, in certain in|&s;tances,
which on the whole, would be upwards of
two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Now if tho&s;e very fines di&s;able the country
from rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient revenue, without producing
an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the
ca&s;e and intere&s;t of all parties, to encrea&s;e the reve|nue
<PB N="257" REF="259">
in the manner I have propo&s;ed, or any better, if
a better can be devi&s;ed, and cea&s;e the operation of
the fines? I would &s;till keep the militia as an or|ganized
body of men, and, &s;hould there be a real
nece&s;&s;ity to call them forth, pay them out of the
proper revenues of the &s;tate, and encrea&s;e the taxes
a third or fourth per cent. on tho&s;e who do not at|tend.
My limits will not allow me to go farther
into this matter, which I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e with
this remark, that fines are, of all modes of revenue,
the mo&s;t un&s;uited to the mind of a free country.
When a man pays a tax, he knows the public ne|ce&s;&s;ity
requires it, and therefore feels a pride in
di&s;charging his duty; but a fine &s;eems an atone|ment
for neglect of duty, and of con&s;equence, is
paid with di&s;credit, and frequently levied with
with &s;everity.</P>
<P>I have now only one &s;ubject more to &s;peak to,
with which I &s;hall conclude, which is, the re&s;olve
of Congre&s;s of the 18th of March la&s;t, for taking up
and funding the pre&s;ent currency at forty for one,
and i&s;&s;uing new money in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>Every one knows that I am not the flatterer of
Congre&s;s but in this in&s;tance <HI>they are right</HI>; and if
that mea&s;ure is &s;upported, the currency will acquire
a value, which, without it, it will not. But this is
not all: It will give relief to the finances until &s;uch
time as they can be properly arranged, and &s;ave the
<PB N="258" REF="260">
country from being immediately double taxed un|der
the pre&s;ent mode. In &s;hort, &s;upport that mea|&s;ure,
and it will &s;upport you.</P>
<P>I have now waded through a tedious cour&s;e of
difficult bu&s;ine&s;s, and over an untrodden path. The
&s;ubject on every point it could be viewed, was en|tangled
with perplexities, and enveloped in ob&s;urity,
yet &s;uch are the re&s;ources of America, that &s;he
wants nothing but &s;y&s;tem to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>On the pre&s;ent State of News.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets,
in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at New York from England, a
variety of unconnected <HI>news</HI> has circulated through
the country, and afforded as great a variety of &s;pe|culation.</P>
<P>That &s;omething is the matter in the cabinet and
councils of our enemies, on the other &s;ide of the
water is certain&mdash;that they have run their length
of madne&s;s, and are under the nece&s;&s;ity of changing
their mea&s;ures may ea&s;ily be &s;een into; but to what
this change of mea&s;ure may amount, or how far
it may corre&s;pond with our intere&s;t, happine&s;s and
duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hi|therto
<PB N="260" REF="262">
experienced, we have too much rea&s;on to
&s;u&s;pect them in every thing.</P>
<P>I do not addre&s;s this publication &s;o much to the
people of America as to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, who|ever
they may be, for if it is their intention to pro|mote
any kind of negociation, it is proper they
&s;hould know before hand, that the United States
have as much honour as bravery; that they are no
more to be &s;educed from their alliance, than their
allegiance; that their line of politics is formed, and
not dependant, like that of their enemy, on chance,
and accident.</P>
<P>On our part, in order to know, at any time,
what the Briti&s;h government will do, we have
only to find out what they ought <HI>not</HI> to do, and this
la&s;t will be their conduct. For ever changing, and
for ever wrong; too di&s;tant from America to im|prove
circum&s;tances, and too unwi&s;e to fore&s;ee
them; &s;cheming without principle, and executing
without probability; their whole line of manage|ment
has hitherto been blunder and ba&s;ene&s;s.
Every campaign has added to their lo&s;s, and every
year to their di&s;grace; till unable to go on, and
a&s;hamed to go back, their politics have come to a
halt, and all their fine pro&s;pects to the halter.</P>
<P>Could our affections forgive, or humanity for|get
the wounds of an infant country&mdash;we might,
under the influence of a momentary oblivion, &s;tand
<PB N="261" REF="263">
&s;till and laugh. But they are engraven where no
amu&s;ement can conceal them, and of a kind for
which there is no recompence. Can ye re&s;tore
to us the beloved dead? Can ye &s;ay to the
grave, give up the murdered; Can ye obliterate
from our memories tho&s;e who are no more? Think
not then to tamper with our feelings by in&s;idious
contrivance, nor &s;uffocate our humanity by &s;edu|cing
us to di&s;honour.</P>
<P>In March 1780, I publi&s;hed part of the Cri&s;is,
No. IX, in the new&s;papers, but did not conclude it
in the following papers, and the remainder has lain
by me till the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>There appeared about that time &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition
in the Briti&s;h cabinet to cea&s;e the further pro&s;ecu|tion
of the war, and, as I had formed my opinion,
that whenever &s;uch a de&s;ign &s;hould take place, it
would be accompanied with a di&s;honourable pro|po&s;ition
to America, re&s;pecting France, I had &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
the remainder of that number, not to ex|po&s;e
the ba&s;ene&s;s of any &s;uch propo&s;ition. But
the arrival of the next news from England, declared
her determination to go on with the war, and con|&s;equently
as the political object I had then in view
was not become a &s;ubject, it is unnece&s;&s;ary in me
to bring it forward, which is the rea&s;on it was
never publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The matter which I allude to in the unpubli&s;hed
part, I &s;hall now make a quotation of, and apply it
<PB N="262" REF="264">
as the more enlarged &s;tate of things, at this day,
&s;hall make convenient or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It was as follows:</P>
<P>"By the &s;peeches which have appeared from the
Briti&s;h Parliament, it is ea&s;y to perceive to what
impolitic and imprudent exce&s;&s;es their pa&s;&s;ions and
prejudices, have, in every in&s;tance, carried them
during the pre&s;ent war. Provoked at the upright
and honourable treaty between America and France,
they imagined nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary to be
done to prevent its final ratification, than to pro|mi&s;e
through the agency of their commi&s;sioners,
(Carli&s;le, Eden, and John&s;ton) a repeal of their
once offen&s;ive acts of parliament. The vanity of
the conceit was as unpardonable, as the experiment
was impolitic. And &s;o convinced am I, of their
wrong ideas of America, that I &s;hall not wonder, if
in their la&s;t &s;tage of political phrenzy, they propo&s;e
to her, to break her alliance with France, and en|ter
into one with them. Such a propo&s;ition, &s;hould
it ever be made, and it has already been more than
once hinted in parliament, would di&s;cover &s;uch a
di&s;po&s;ition to perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;uch di&s;regard of
honour and morals, as would add the fini&s;hing vice
to national corruption.&mdash;I do not mention this to
put America on the watch, but to put England on
her guard, that &s;he do not, in the loo&s;ene&s;s of her
<PB N="263" REF="265">
heart, envelope in di&s;grace, every fragment of re|putation."&mdash;Thus far the quotation.</P>
<P>By the complexion of &s;ome part of the news,
which has tran&s;pired through the New York pa|pers,
it &s;eems probable that this in&s;idious aera in the
Briti&s;h politics, is beginning to make its appear|ance.
I wi&s;h it may not; for that which is a di&s;|grace
to human nature, throws &s;omething of a &s;hade
over all the human character, and the individual
feels his &s;hare of the wound, that is given to the
whole.</P>
<P>The policy of Britain has ever been to divide
America in &s;ome way or other. In the beginning
of the di&s;pute, &s;he practi&s;ed every art to prevent
or de&s;troy the union of the &s;tates, well knowing,
that could &s;he once get them to &s;tand &s;ingly, &s;he
could conquer them unconditionally. Failing in
this project in America, &s;he renewed it in Europe;
and after the alliance had taken place, &s;he made &s;e|cret
offers to France to induce her to give up Ame|rica,
and what is &s;till more extraordinary, &s;he at
the &s;ame time, made propo&s;itions to doctor Frank|lin,
then in Paris, the very court to which &s;he was
&s;ecretly applying, to draw off America from France.
But this is not all.</P>
<P>On the 14th of September, 1778, the Briti&s;h
court, through their &s;ecretary, lord Weymouth,
made application to the Marquis D'Almadovar the
<PB N="264" REF="266">
Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, at London, to "a&s;k the
MEDIATION," for the&s;e were the words of the
court of Spain, for the purpo&s;e of negociation a
peace with France, leaving America (as I &s;hall
hereafter &s;hew) out of the que&s;tion. Spain readily
offered her Mediation, and likewi&s;e the city of Ma|drid
as the place of conference, but withal, propo&s;ed
that the united States of America &s;hould be invited
to the treaty, and con&s;idered as independent during
the time the bu&s;ine&s;s was negociating. But this
was not the view of England. She wanted to draw
France from the war, that &s;he might uninterruptedly
pour out all her force and fury upon America: and
being di&s;appointed in this plan as well through the
open and generous conduct of Spain, as the deter|mination
of France, &s;he refu&s;ed the mediation &s;he
had &s;olicited.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give &s;ome extracts from the ju&s;tifying
memorial of the Spani&s;h court, in which &s;he has &s;et
the conduct and character of Britain with re&s;pect
to America, in a clear and &s;triking point of
light.</P>
<P>The memorial &s;peaking of the refu&s;al of the Bri|ti&s;h
court to meet in conference, with commi&s;|&s;ioners
from the United States, who were to be
con&s;idered as independent during the time of the
conference, &s;ays,</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridicu|culous,
that the court of London, who treats the
colonies as independent, not only in acting, but of
right, during the war, &s;hould have a repugnance to
treat them as &s;uch only in acting during a truce of
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities. The convention of Sara|toga;
the reputing general Burgoyne as a lawful
pri&s;oner, in order to &s;u&s;pend his trial; the exchange
and liberating other pri&s;oners made from the colonies;
they having named Commi&s;&s;ioners to go and &s;uppli|cate
the Americans, at their own doors, reque&s;t
peace of them, and treat with them and the Congre&s;s,
and finally by a thou&s;and other acts of this &s;ort, au|thori&s;ed
by the court of London, which have
been, and are true &s;igns of the acknowledgement of
of their independence.</P>
<P>"In aggravation to all the foregoing, at the &s;ame
time the Briti&s;h cabinet an&s;wered the king of Spain
in the terms already mentioned; they were in&s;inua|ting
them&s;elves at the court of France by means of
&s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries, and making very great offers to
her to abandon the colonies and make peace
with England. But there is yet more; for at this
&s;ame time the Engli&s;h mini&s;try were treating by
means of another certain emi&s;&s;ary, with doctor
Franklin, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the colonies,
re&s;iding at Paris, to whom they made various pro|po&s;als
<PB N="266" REF="268">
to di&s;unite them from France, and accommo|date
matters with England."</P>
<P>"From what has been ob&s;erved it evidently fol|lows,
that the whole of the Briti&s;h politics was to
di&s;unite the two courts of Paris and Madrid, by
means of the &s;ugge&s;tions and offers &s;he &s;eparately
made to them; and al&s;o to &s;eparate the colonies
from their treaties and engagements entered into
with France, and induce them to arm again&s;t the
hou&s;e of Bourbon or MORE PROBABLY TO
OPPRESS THEM WHEN THEY FOUND
FROM BREAKING THEIR ENGAGE|MENTS,
THEY STOOD ALONE AND
WITHOUT PROTECTORS."</P>
<P>"This therefore is the net they laid for the Ame|rican
&s;tates; that is to &s;ay, to tempt them with flat|tering
and very magnificent promi&s;es to come to
an accommodation with them, exclu&s;ive of any in|tervention
of Spain or France, that the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;try
might always remain the arbiters of the fate
of the colonies.</P>
<P>"But the Catholic king, (the king of Spain)
faithful on the one part to the engagements which
bind him to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king (the king of
France) his nephew; ju&s;t and upright on the other,
to his own &s;ubjects whom he ought to protect and
guard again&s;t &s;o many in&s;ults, and finally, full of
humanity and compa&s;&s;ion for the Americans and
<PB N="267" REF="269">
other individuals who &s;uffer in the pre&s;ent war, he
is determined to pur&s;ue and pro&s;ecute it, and to
make all the efforts in his power, until he can ob|tain
a &s;olid and permanent peace, with full and &s;a|tisfactory
&s;ecurities that it &s;hall be ob&s;erved."</P>
<P>Thus far the memorial; a tran&s;lation of which
into Engli&s;h, may be &s;een in full, under the head of
STATE PAPERS, in the Annual Regi&s;ter for
1779, page 367.</P>
<P>The extracts I have here given, &s;erve to &s;hew
the various endeavours and contrivances of the ene|my
to draw France from her connection with Ame|rica,
and to prevail on her to make a &s;eparate peace
with England, leaving America totally out of the
que&s;tion, and at the mercy of a mercile&s;s unprin|cipled
enemy. The opinion, likewi&s;e, which
Spain has formed of the Briti&s;h cabinet character,
for meanne&s;s and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, is &s;o exactly the
opinion of America, re&s;pecting it, that the memo|rial
in this in&s;tance, contains our own &s;entiments
and language; for people, however remote, who
think alike, will unavoidably &s;peak alike.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the in&s;idious u&s;e which Britain en|deavoured
to make of the propo&s;itions for peace,
under the mediation of Spain.&mdash;I &s;hall now proceed
to the &s;econd propo&s;ition under the mediation of
the emperor of Germany and the empre&s;s of
Ru&s;&s;ia; the general outline of which was, that a
<PB N="268" REF="270">
congre&s;s of the &s;everal powers at war, &s;hould meet
at Vienna, in 1781, to &s;ettle preliminaries of
peace.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h my&s;elf at liberty to make u&s;e of
all the information I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of on this &s;ub|ject;
but as there is a delicacy in the manner, I
do not conceive it prudent, at lea&s;t at pre&s;ent, to
make references and quotations in the &s;ame manner
as I have done with re&s;pect to the mediation of
Spain, who publi&s;hed the whole proceedings her|&s;elf;
and, therefore, what comes from me on this
part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t re&s;t on my own credit
with the public, a&s;&s;uring them, that when the
whole proceedings, relative to the propo&s;ed con|gre&s;s
at Vienna, &s;hall appear, they &s;hall find my
account not only true but &s;tudiou&s;ly moderate.</P>
<P>We know that at the time this mediation was
on the carpet, the expectations of the Briti&s;h king
and mini&s;try ran high with re&s;pect to the conque&s;t
of America. The Engli&s;h packet which was
taken with the mail on board, and carried into
l'Orient, in France, contained letters from lord
G. Germaine to &s;ir Henry Clinton, which ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
in the fulle&s;t terms, the mini&s;terial idea of
a total conque&s;t. Copies of tho&s;e letters were &s;ent
to Congre&s;s, and publi&s;hed in the new&s;papers of
la&s;t year. Colonel Laurens brought over the ori|ginals,
&s;ome of which, &s;igned in the hand writing
<PB N="269" REF="271">
of the then &s;ecretary Germaine, are now in my
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Filled with the&s;e high ideas, nothing could be
more in&s;olent towards America than the language
of the Briti&s;h court on the propo&s;ed meditation.
A peace with France and Spain &s;he anxiou&s;ly &s;o|licited;
but America, as before, &s;hould be left to
her mercy; neither would &s;he hear any propo|&s;itions
for admitting an agent from the United
States into the congre&s;s of Vienna.</P>
<P>On the other hand, France with an open, no|ble,
and manly determination, and the fidelity of
a good ally, would hear no propo&s;ition for a &s;e|parate
peace, nor even meet in congre&s;s at Vi|enna,
without an agent from America: and like|wi&s;e,
that the independant character of the United
States, repre&s;ented by the agent, &s;hould be fully
and unequivocally defined and &s;ettled before any
conference &s;hould be entered on. The rea&s;oning
of the court of France on the &s;everal propo&s;i|tions
of the two Imperial courts, which relate
to us, is rather in the &s;tyle of an American,
than an ally; and &s;he advocated the cau&s;e of
America, as if &s;he had been America her&s;elf.
Thus the &s;econd mediation, like the fir&s;t, proved
ineffectual.</P>
<P>But &s;ince that time a rever&s;e of fortune has over|taken
the Briti&s;h arms, and all their high expecta|tions
are da&s;hed to the ground. The noble exer|tions
<PB N="270" REF="272">
to the &s;outhward, under general Green; the
&s;ucce&s;sful operations of the allied armies in the
Che&s;epeake; the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of their i&s;lands in the
We&s;t-Indies, and Minorca in the Mediterranean;
the per&s;evering &s;pirit of Spain again&s;t Gibraltar;
the expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of
making a &s;eparate peace with Holland, and the ex|pence
of one hundred millions &s;terling, by which
all the&s;e fine lo&s;&s;es were obtained, have read them
a loud le&s;&s;on of di&s;graceful misfortune, and ne|ce&s;&s;ity
has called on them to change their ground.
in this &s;ituation of confu&s;ion and de&s;pair their pre|&s;ent
councils have no fixed character. It is now the
hurricane months of Briti&s;h politics. Every day
&s;eems to have a &s;torm of its own, and they are
&s;cudding under the bare poles of hope. Beaten,
but not humble; condemned, but not penitent;
they act like men trembling at fate, and catching at
a &s;traw.&mdash;From this convul&s;ion in the intrails of
their politics, it is more than probable that the
mountain groaning in labor, will bring forth a
mou&s;e as to its &s;ize, and a mon&s;ter in its make.
They will try on America the &s;ame in&s;idious arts
they tried on France and Spain.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes experience &s;en&s;ations to which
language is not equal. The conception is too bulky
to be born alive, and in the torture of thinking we
&s;tand dumb. Our feelings, impri&s;oned by their
<PB N="271" REF="273">
magnitude, find no way out&mdash;and, in the &s;truggle
of expre&s;&s;ion every finger tries to be a tongue.
The machinery of the body &s;eems too little for the
mind, and we look about for helps to &s;hew our
thoughts by.&mdash;Such mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;ation of
America, whenever Britain, teeming with cor|ruption,
&s;hall propo&s;e to her to &s;acrifice her
faith.</P>
<P>But, exclu&s;ive of the wickedne&s;s, there is a per|&s;onal
offence contained in every &s;uch attempt.
It is calling us villains; for no man a&s;ks another to
act the villain unle&s;s he believes him inclined to
be one. No man attempts to &s;educe a truly hone&s;t
woman. It is the &s;uppo&s;ed loo&s;ene&s;s of her mind
that &s;tarts the thoughts of &s;eduction, and he who
offers it calls her a pro&s;titute. Our pride is always
hurt by the &s;ame propo&s;itions, which offend our
principles; for when we are &s;hocked at the
crime, we are wounded by the &s;u&s;picion of our
compliance.</P>
<P>Could I convey a thought that might &s;erve to re|gulate
the public mind, I would not make the in|tere&s;t
of the alliance the ba&s;is of defending it. All
the world are moved by intere&s;t, and it affords
them nothing to boa&s;t of. But I would go a
&s;tep higher, and defend it on the ground of
honour and principle. That our public affairs
have flouri&s;hed under the alliance&mdash;that it was
<PB N="272" REF="274">
wi&s;ely made, and has been nobly executed&mdash;that
by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance we are enabled to pre&s;erve our
country from conque&s;t, and expel tho&s;e who &s;ought
our de&s;truction&mdash;that it is our true intere&s;t to
maintain it unimpaired, and that while we do &s;o
no enemy can conquer us;&mdash;are matters which ex|perience
has taught us, and the common good
of our&s;elves, ab&s;tracted from principles of faith
and honor, would lead us to maintain the con|nection.</P>
<P>But over and above the mere letter of the al|liance,
we have been nobly and generou&s;ly
treated, and have had the &s;ame re&s;pect and attention
paid us, as if we had been an old e&s;tabli&s;hed
country. To oblige, and be obliged, is fair
work among mankind, and we want an oppor|tunity
of &s;hewing to the world that we are a
people &s;en&s;ible of kindne&s;s, and worthy of con|fidence.
&mdash;Character is to us, in our pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances, of more importance than intere&s;t.
We are a young nation, ju&s;t &s;tepping upon the
&s;tage of public life, and the eye of the world is
upon us to &s;ee how we act. We have an ene|my
that is watching to de&s;troy our reputation,
and who will go any length to gain &s;ome evi|dence
again&s;t us, that may &s;erve to render
our conduct &s;u&s;pected, and our character odious;
becau&s;e, could &s;he accompli&s;h this, wicked as it
<PB N="273" REF="275">
is, the world would withdraw from us, as from
a people not to be tru&s;ted, and our ta&s;k would
then become difficult.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;ets the character of a nation in
a higher or lower light with others, than the faith|fully
&s;ulfilling, or perfidiou&s;ly breaking of treaties.
They are things not to be tampered with; and &s;hould
Britain, which &s;eems very probable, propo&s;e
to &s;educe America into &s;uch an act of ba&s;ene&s;s, it
would merit from her &s;ome mark of unu&s;ual dete&s;|tation.
It is one of tho&s;e extraordinary in&s;tances in
which we ought not to be contented with the bare
negative of congre&s;s, becau&s;e it is an affront on the
multitude as well as on the government. It goes
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the public are not hone&s;t
men, and that they may be managed by contrivance
though they cannot be conquered by arms. But,
let the world and Britain know, that we are neither
to be bought nor &s;old. That our mind is great and
fixt, our pro&s;pect clear, and that we will &s;upport
our character as firmly as our independence.</P>
<P>But I will go &s;till farther, general Conway, who
made the motion in the Briti&s;h parliament, for di&s;|continuing
<HI>offen&s;ive</HI> war in America, is a gentleman
of an amiable character. We have no per&s;onal
quarrel with him. But he feels not as we feel; he
is not in our &s;ituation, and that alone, with out any
other explanation, is enough.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276">
The Briti&s;h parliament &s;uppo&s;es they have many
friends in America, and that when all chance of
conque&s;t is over, they will be able to draw her
from her alliance with France. Now, if I have
any conception of the human heart, they will fail
in this, more than in any thing they have yet tried.</P>
<P>This part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is not a que&s;tion of poli|cy
only but of honour and hone&s;ty; and the propo|&s;ition
will have in it &s;omething &s;o vi&s;ibly low and
ba&s;e that their partizans, if they have any, will be
a&s;hamed of it. Men are often hurt by a mean ac|tion
who are not &s;tarted at a wicked one, and this
will be &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion of their inability, &s;uch a
declaration of &s;ervile thinking, that the &s;candal of it
will ruin all their hopes.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we have nothing to do but to go on
with vigour and determination. The enemy is yet
in our country. They hold New-york, Charle&s;|ton
and Savannah, and the very being in tho&s;e pla|ces
is an offence, and a part of offen&s;ive war, and
until they can be driven from, or captured in them,
it would be folly in us to li&s;ten to an idle tale. I
take it for granted that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try are &s;ink|ing
under the impo&s;&s;ibility of carrying on the war.
Let them come to a fair and open peace with France,
Spain, Holland and America in the manner &s;he
ought to do; but until then we can have nothing to
&s;ay to them.</P>

<HEAD>To Sir Guy Carlton.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the nature of compa&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;ociate with
misfortune; and I addre&s;s this to you in behalf even
of an enemy, a captain in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, now
on his way to the head quarters of the American
army, and unfortunately doomed to death for a
crime not his own.&mdash;A &s;entence &s;o extraordinary,
an execution &s;o repugnant to every human &s;en&s;ation,
ought never to be told without the circum&s;tances
which produced it; and as the de&s;tined victim is yet
in exi&s;tence, and in your hands re&s;t his life or death,
I &s;hall briefly &s;tate the ca&s;e and the melancholy con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>Captain Huddy of the Jer&s;ey militia, was attacked
in a &s;mall fort on Tom's river, by a party of refu|gees
in the Briti&s;h pay and &s;ervice, was made pri&s;oner
together with his company, carried to New-York
and lodged in the provo&s;t of that city: about three
weeks after which, he was taken out of the Provo&s;t
down to the water-&s;ide, put into a boat and brought
again upon the Jer&s;ey &s;hore, and there, contrary to
the practice of all nations but &s;avages, was hung up
on a tree, and left hanging until found by our peo|ple,
who took him down and buried him.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278">
The inhabitants of that part of the country where
the murder was committed, &s;ent a deputation to
General Wa&s;hington with a full and certified &s;tate|ment
of the fact. Struck, as every human brea&s;t
mu&s;t be, with &s;uch bruti&s;h outrage, and determined
both to puni&s;h and prevent it for the future, the ge|neral
repre&s;ented the ca&s;e to General Clinton, who
then commanded, and demanded that the refugee
officer, who ordered and attended the execution,
and who&s;e name is Lippincut, &s;hould be delivered
up as a murderer; and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, that the
per&s;on of &s;ome Briti&s;h officer &s;hould &s;uffer in his
&s;tead. The demand, though not refu&s;ed, has
not been complied with; and the melancholy lot,
(not by &s;election, but by ca&s;ting lots) has fallen
upon Captain A&s;gill of the guards, who, as I have
already mentioned, is on his way from Lanca&s;ter to
camp, a martyr to the general wickedne&s;s of the
cau&s;e he engaged in, and the ingratitude of tho&s;e he
has &s;erved.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t reflection that ari&s;es on this black bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
is, what &s;ort of men mu&s;t Engli&s;hmen be,
and what &s;ort of order and di&s;cipline do they pre|&s;erve
in their army, when, in the immediate place
of their head quarters, and under the eye and no&s;e
of their commander in chief, a pri&s;oner can be ta|ken
at plea&s;ure from his confinement, and his death
made a matter of &s;port.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="279">
The hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t &s;avage Indians does not
produce in&s;tances exactly of this kind. They, at
lea&s;t, have a formality in their puni&s;hments. With
them it is the horridne&s;s of revenge, but with your
army it is the &s;till greater crime, the horridne&s;s of
diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h generals who have &s;ucceeded each
other, from the time of General Gage to your&s;elf,
have all affected to &s;peak in language they have no
right to. In their proclamations, their addre&s;&s;es,
their letters to General Wa&s;hington, and their &s;up|plications
to Congre&s;s (for they de&s;erve no other
name), they talk of Briti&s;h honour, Briti&s;h genero|&s;ity,
and Briti&s;h clemency, as if tho&s;e things were
matters of fact; whereas, we, who&s;e eyes are open,
who &s;peak the &s;ame language with your&s;elves, many
of whom were born on the &s;ame &s;pot with you,
and who can no more be mi&s;taken in your
words, than in your actions, can declare to all
the world, that &s;o far as our knowledge goes,
there is not a more dete&s;table character, nor a
meaner, or more barbarous enemy than the pre&s;ent
Briti&s;h one. With us, you have forfeited all pre|tentions
of reputation, and it is only holding you
like a wild bea&s;t, afraid of your keepers, that you
can be made manageable&mdash;But to return to the
point in que&s;tion:</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="280">
Though I can think no man innocent who has
lent his hand to de&s;troy the country which he did
not plant, and to ruin tho&s;e he could not en&s;lave,
yet ab&s;tracted from all ideas of right or wrong on
the original que&s;tion, Captain A&s;gyli, in the pre&s;ent
ca&s;e, is not the guilty man. The villain and the
victim are here &s;eparated characters. You hold
the one and we the other. You di&s;own or affect
to di&s;own and reprobate the conduct of Lippencut,
yet you give him &s;anctuary, and by &s;o doing, you
as effectually become the executioner of A&s;gill, as
if you put the rope round his neck, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
him from the world. Whatever your feelings on
this extraordinary occa&s;ion may be, are be&s;t known
to your&s;elf. Within the grave of our own mind
lies buried the fate of A&s;gill. He becomes the
corp&s;e of your will, or the &s;urvivor of your ju&s;tice.
Deliver up the one, and you &s;ave the other; with|hold
the one, and the other dies by your choice.</P>
<P>On our part the ca&s;e is exceeding plain; AN
OFFICER HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM
HIS CONFINEMENT AND MURDERED
AND THE MURDERER IS WITHIN
YOUR LINES. Your army have been guilty
of a thou&s;and in&s;tances of equal cruelty, but they
have been rendered equivocal, and &s;heltered from
per&s;onal detection. Here the crime is fixt; and
is one of tho&s;e extraordinary ca&s;es, which can nei|ther
<PB N="279" REF="281">
be denied nor palliated, and to which the
cu&s;tom o&s; war does not apply; for it never could
be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch a brutal outrage would ever
be committed. It is an original in the hi&s;tory of
civilized barbarians, and is truly Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>On your part, you are accountable to us for the
per&s;onal &s;afety of the pri&s;oners within your walls.
Here can be no mi&s;take: they can neither be &s;pies
nor &s;u&s;pected as &s;uch; your &s;ecurity is not endan|gered,
nor your operations &s;ubjected to mi&s;carriage,
by men immured within a dungeon. They differ
in every cirum&s;tance from men in the field, and
leave no pretence for &s;everity of puni&s;hment. But
if to the di&s;mal condition of captivity with you,
mu&s;t be added the con&s;tant apprehen&s;ions of death;
if to be impri&s;oned is &s;o nearly to be entombed,
and, if after all, the murderers are to be protected,
and thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you
differ from Indians, either in conduct or character.</P>
<P>We can have no idea of your honour, or your
ju&s;tice in any future tran&s;action, of what nature it
may be, while you &s;helter within your lines an out|rageous
murderer, and &s;acrifice in his &s;tead, an
officer of your own. If you have no regard to us
at lea&s;t &s;pare the blood which it is your duty to
&s;ave. Whether the pui&s;hment will be greater on
him, whom in this ca&s;e innocently dies, or on him
whom &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity forces to retaliate, is, in the
<PB N="280" REF="282">
nicety of &s;en&s;ation, an undecided Que&s;tion? It
re&s;ts with you to prevent the &s;ufferings of both.
You have nothing to do but to give up the murder|er,
and the matter ends.</P>
<P>But to protect him, be he who he may, is to pa|tronize
his crime, and to trifle it off by frivolous and
and unmeaning enquiries is to promote it. There
is no declaration you can make, no promi&s;e you can
give that will obtain credit. It is the man and not
the apology that is demanded.</P>
<P>You &s;ee your&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides to &s;pare the
life of your own officer, for die he will if you with|hold
ju&s;tice. The murder of captain Huddy is an
offence not to be borne with, and there is no &s;ecurity
we can have that &s;uch actions, or &s;imilar ones &s;hall
not be repeated, but by making the puni&s;hment fall
upon your&s;elves. To de&s;troy the la&s;t &s;ecurity of
captivity, and to take the unarmed, the unre&s;i&s;ting
pri&s;oner to private and &s;portive execution, is carry|ing
barbarity too high for &s;ilence. The evil mu&s;t
be put an end to, and the choice of per&s;ons re&s;ts
with you. But if your attachment to the guilty is
&s;tronger than to the innocent, you invent a crime
that mu&s;t de&s;troy your character, and if the cau&s;e
of your King needs to be &s;upported, for ever cea&s;e,
&s;ir, to torture our remembrance with the wretched
phra&s;es of Briti&s;h honour, Briti&s;h genero&s;ity, and
Briti&s;h clemency.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283">
From this melancholy circum&s;tance, learn, &s;ir, a
le&s;&s;on of morality. The refugees are men whom
your predece&s;&s;ors have in&s;tructed in wickedne&s;s, the
better to fit them to their ma&s;ter's purpo&s;e. To
make them u&s;eful they have made them vile, and the

on the heads of their encouragers. They have
been trained like hounds to the &s;cent of blood, and
cheri&s;hed in every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;olute barbarity.
Their ideas of right and wrong are worn away in
the con&s;tant habitude of repeated infamy, till like
men practi&s;ed in executions, they feel not the value
of another's life,</P>
<P>The ta&s;k before you though painful is not diffi|cult;

time to act before the reli&s;h for new &s;cenes is

<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;the mighty magnitude
of the object&mdash;the various uncertainties of fate
it has undergone&mdash;the numerous and complicated

we now &s;tand on, and the va&s;t pro&s;pect
before us, mu&s;t all con&s;pire to impre&s;s us with con|templation.</P>
<P>To &s;ee it in our power to make a world happy
&mdash;to teach mankind the art of being &s;o&mdash;to ex|hibit
on the theatre of the univer&s;e, a character hi|therto
unknown&mdash;and to have, as it were, a new
creation entru&s;ted to our hands, are honors that
command reflection, and can neither be too highly
e&s;timated, nor too gratefully received.</P>
<P>In this pau&s;e then of recollection&mdash;while the
&s;torm is cea&s;ing, and the long agitated mind vi|brating
to a re&s;t, let us look back on the &s;cenes we
have pa&s;&s;ed, and learn from experience what is yet
to be done.</P>
<P>Never, I &s;ay, had a country &s;o many openings to
happine&s;s as this. Her &s;etting out into life, like
the ri&s;ing of a fair morning, was unclouded and
promi&s;ing. Her cau&s;e was good. Her princi|pals
<PB N="284" REF="286">
ju&s;t and liberal. Her temper &s;erene and firm.
Her conduct regulated by the nice&s;t &s;teps, and
every thing about her wore the mark of honour.</P>
<P>It is not every country (perhaps there is not ano|ther
in the world) that can boa&s;t &s;o fair an origin.
Even the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of America corre&s;ponds
with the character of the revolution. Rome, once
the proud mi&s;tre&s;s of the univer&s;e, was originally
a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her
rich, and her oppre&s;&s;ion of millions made her great.
But America needs never be a&s;hamed to tell her
birth, nor relate the &s;tages by which &s;he ro&s;e to
empire.</P>
<P>The remembrance then of what is pa&s;t, if it
operates rightly, mu&s;t in&s;pire her with the mo&s;t
laudable of all ambition, that of adding to the
fair fame &s;he began with. The world has &s;een her
great in adver&s;ity. Struggling without a thought
of yielding beneath accumulated difficulties.
Bravely, nay proudly, encountering di&s;tre&s;s, and
ri&s;ing in re&s;olution as the &s;torm encrea&s;ed. All
this is ju&s;tly due to her, for her fortitude has
merited the character. Let then the world &s;ee that
&s;he can bear pro&s;perity: and that her hone&s;t virtue
in time of peace, is equal to the brave&s;t virtue in
time of war.</P>
<P>She is now de&s;cending to the &s;cenes of quiet and
dome&s;tic life. Not beneath the cypre&s;s &s;hade of
<PB N="285" REF="287">
di&s;appointment, but to enjoy in her own land,
and under her own vine, the &s;weet of her labors,
and the reward of her toil. In this &s;ituation, may
&s;he never forget that a fair national reputation is
of as much importance as independence. That it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a charm which wins upon the world, and
makes even enemies civil. That it gives a dignity
which is often &s;uperior to power, and commands a
reverence where pomp and &s;plendor fail.</P>
<P>It would be a circum&s;tance ever to be lamented
and never to be forgotten, were a &s;ingle blot, from
any cau&s;e whatever, &s;uffered to fall on a revolution,
which to the end of time mu&s;t be an honor to the
age that accompli&s;hed it: and which has contributed
more to enlighten the world, and diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of
freedom and liberality among mankind, than any
human event (if this may be called one) that ever
preceded it.</P>
<P>It is not among the lea&s;t of the calamities of a
long continued war, that it unhinges the mind from
tho&s;e nice &s;en&s;ations which at other times appear &s;o
amiable. The continual &s;pectacle of woe, blunts
the finer feelings, and the nece&s;&s;ity of bearing with
the &s;ight, renders it familiar. In like manner, are
many of the moral obligations of &s;ociety weakened,
till the cu&s;tom of acting by nece&s;&s;ity, becomes an
apology, where it is truly a crime. Yet let but a
nation conceive rightly of its character, and it will
<PB N="286" REF="288">
be cha&s;tly ju&s;t in protecting it. None ever began
with a fairer than America, and none can be under
a greater obligation to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>The debt which America has contracted, com|pared
with the cau&s;e &s;he has gained, and the ad|vantages
to flow from it, ought &s;carcely to be men|tioned.
She has it in her choice to do, and to live
as happily as &s;he plea&s;es. The world is in her
hands. She has no foreign power to monopolize
her commerce, perplex her legi&s;lation, or con|troul
her pro&s;perity. The &s;truggle is over, which
mu&s;t one day have happened, and perhaps, never
could have happended at a better time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the revolution began at the exact period of time be&s;t fitted to the purpo&s;e, is &s;ufficiently proved by the event&mdash;But the great hinge on which the whole ma|chine turned is the UNION OF THE STATES: and this union was naturally produced by the inability of any one &s;tate to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t any foreign enemy with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Had the &s;tates &s;everally been le&s;s able than they were when the war began, their united &s;trength would not have been equal to the undertaking, and they mu&s;t, in all hu|man probability have failed&mdash;And on the other hand, had they &s;everally been more able, they might not have &s;een, or what is more, might not have felt the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting; and either by attempting to &s;tand alone, or in &s;mall confederacies, would have been &s;eparately con|quered.</P>
<P>Now, as we cannot &s;ee a time (and many years mu&s;t pa&s;s away before it can arrive) when the &s;trength of any one &s;tate, or &s;everal united, can be equal to the whole of the pre&s;ent United States, and as we have &s;een the ex|treme difficulty of collectively pro&s;ecuting the war to a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue, and pre&s;erving our national importance in the world, therefore, from the experience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we mu&s;t, unle&s;s we make a wa&s;te of wi&s;dom, be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the advantage, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;trengthening that happy union which has been our &s;alvation, and without which, we &s;hould have been a ruined people.</P>
<P>While I was writing this note, I ca&s;t my eye on the pamphlet COMMON SENSE, from which I &s;hall make an extract, as it applies exactly to the ca&s;e. It is as follows:</P>
<P>"I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confe&s;&s;ed his opinion that a &s;epa|ration between the countries would take place one time or other: And there is no in&s;tance in which we have &s;hewn le&s;s judgment, than in endeavouring to de&s;cribe, what we call, the ripene&s;s or fitne&s;s of the continent for independence.</P>
<P>"As all men allow the mea&s;ure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove mi&s;takes, take a general &s;urvey of things, and endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out the VERY TIME. But we need not go far, the enquiry cea&s;es at once, for, THE TIME HATH FOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact.</P>
<P>"It is not in numbers, but in a union, that our great &s;trength lies. The continent is ju&s;t arrived at that pitch of &s;trength, in which no &s;ingle colony is able to &s;upport it&s;elf, and the whole when united, can accompli&s;h the matter; and either more or le&s;s than this, might be fatal in its effects."</P></NOTE>. And
<PB N="287" REF="289">
in&s;tead of a domineering ma&s;ter, &s;he has gained an
<HI>ally,</HI> who&s;e exemplary greatne&s;s, and univer&s;al li|berality,
have extorted a confe&s;&s;ion even from her
enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">
With the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, independence, and
an univer&s;al commerce, the &s;tates individually, and
collectively, will have lei&s;ure and opportunity to re|gulate
and e&s;tabli&s;h their dome&s;tic concerns, and
to put it beyond the power of calumny to throw
the lea&s;t reflection on their honor. Character is
much ea&s;ier kept than recovered, and that man, if
any &s;uch there be, who, from any &s;ini&s;ter views, or
littlene&s;s of &s;oul, lends un&s;een his hand to injure it,
contrives a wound it will never be in his power to
heal.</P>
<P>As we have e&s;tabli&s;hed an inheritance for po&s;|terity,
let that inheritance de&s;cend, with every mark
of an honourable conveyance. The little it will
co&s;t, compared with the worth of the &s;tates, the
greatne&s;s of the object, and the value of national
character, will be a profitable exchange.</P>
<P>But that which mu&s;t more forcibly &s;trike a
thoughtful penetrating mind, and which includes
and renders ea&s;y all inferior concerns, is the
<PB N="289" REF="291">
UNION OF THE STATES. On this, our great
national character depends. It is this which mu&s;t
give&punc; us importance abroad and &s;ecurity at home.
It is through this only that we are, or can be
nationally known in the world. It is the flag
of the United States which renders our &s;hips
and commerce &s;afe on the &s;eas, or in a foreign
port. Our Mediterranean pa&s;&s;es mu&s;t be ob|tained
under the &s;ame &s;tile. All our treaties,
whether of alliance, peace or commerce, are
formed under the &s;overeignty of the United
States, and Europe knows us by no other name
or title.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the empire into &s;tates is for
our own convenience, but abroad this di&s;tinction
cea&s;es. The affairs of each &s;tate are local.
They can go no farther than to it&s;elf. And
were the whole worth of even the riche&s;t of
them expended in revenue, it would not be &s;uf|ficient
to &s;upport &s;overeignty again&s;t a foreign
attack. In &s;hort, we have no other national &s;o|vereignty
than as United States. It would even
be fatal for us if we had&mdash;too expen&s;ive to be
maintained, and impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;upported. In|dividuals
or individual &s;tates may call them&s;elves
what they plea&s;e; but the world, and e&s;pecially
the world of enemies, is not to be held in awe by
the whi&s;tling of a name. Sovereignty mu&s;t have
<PB N="290" REF="292">
power to protect all the parts that compo&s;e and
con&s;titute it: and as UNITED STATES we are
equal to the importance of the title, but otherwi&s;e
we are not. Our union well and wi&s;ely regulated
and cemented, is the cheape&s;t way of being great,
the ea&s;ie&s;t way of being powerful, and the hap|pie&s;t
invention in government, which the cir|cum&s;tances
of America can admit of&mdash;Becau&s;e it
collects from each &s;tate, that, which, by being in|adequate,
can be of no u&s;e to it, and forms an ag|gregate
that &s;erves for all.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of Holland are an unfortunate in&s;tance
of the effects of individual &s;overeignty. Their
disjointed condition expo&s;es them to numerous in|trigues,
lo&s;&s;es, calamities and enemies; and the
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of bringing their mea&s;ures to a
deci&s;ion, and that deci&s;ion into execution, is to
them, and would be to us, a &s;ource of endle&s;s mis|fortune.</P>
<P>It is with confederated &s;tates, as with individuals
in &s;ociety; &s;omething mu&s;t be yielded up to make
the whole &s;ecure. In this view of things, we gain
by what we give, and draw an annual intere&s;t
greater than the capital.&mdash;I ever feel my&s;elf
hurt when I hear the union, that great palladium of
our liberty and &s;afety, the lea&s;t irreverently &s;poken
of. It is the mo&s;t &s;acred thing in the con&s;titution
of America, and that, which every man &s;hould be
<PB N="291" REF="293">
mo&s;t proud and tender of. Our citizen&s;hip in the
United &s;tates is our national character. Our citi|zen&s;hip
in any particular &s;tate, is only our local di&s;|tinction.
By the latter, we are known at home, by
the former to the world. Our great title is,
AMERICANS&mdash;our inferior one varies with the
place.</P>
<P>So far as my endeavours could go, they have all
been directed to conciliate the affections, unite the
intere&s;ts, and draw and keep the mind of the coun|try
together; and the better to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this founda|tion
work of the revolution, I have avoided all
places of profit or office, either in the &s;tate I live
in, or in the United States; kept my&s;elf at a di&s;|tance
from all parties and party connections, and
even di&s;regarded all private and inferior concerns:
and when we take into view the great work we have
gone through, and feel as we ought to feel, the ju&s;t
importance of it, we &s;hall then &s;ee, that the little
wranglings, and indecent contentions of per&s;onal
party, are as di&s;honourable to our characters, as
they are injurious to our repo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the cau&s;e of America that made me an
author. The force with which it &s;truck my
mind, and the dangerous condition of the coun|try
appeared to me in, by courting an impo&s;&s;i|ble
and unnatural reconciliation with tho&s;e who
were determined to reduce her, in&s;tead of &s;triking
<PB N="292" REF="294">
out into the only line that could cement and
&s;ave her, A DECLARATION OF INDE|PENDENCE,
made it impo&s;&s;ible for me, feeling
as I did, to be &s;ilent: and if, in the cour&s;e of
more than &s;even years, I have rendered her any
&s;ervice, I have likewi&s;e added &s;omething to the
reputation of literature, by freely and di&s;intere&s;tedly
employing it in the great cau&s;e of mankind,
and &s;hewing there may be genius without pro&s;|titution.</P>
<P>Independence always appeared to me practi|cable
and probable; provided the &s;entiment of
the country could be formed, and held to the
object; and there is no in&s;tance in the world,
where a people &s;o extended, and wedded to for|mer
habits of thinking, and under &s;uch a variety
of circum&s;tances, were &s;o in&s;tantly and ineffectu|ally
pervaded, by a turn in politics, as in the
ca&s;e of independence, and who &s;upported their
opinon, undimini&s;hed, through &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of good and ill-fortune, till they crowned it with
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But as the &s;cenes of war are clo&s;ed, and every
man preparing for home and happier times, I
therefore take my leave of the &s;ubject. I have
mo&s;t &s;incerely followed it from beginning to end,
and through all its turns and windings: and what|ever
<PB N="293" REF="295">
country I may hereafter be in, I &s;hall always
feel an hone&s;t pride at the part I have taken and
acted, and a gratitude to Nature and Providence
for putting it in my power to be of &s;ome u&s;e to
mankind.</P>
