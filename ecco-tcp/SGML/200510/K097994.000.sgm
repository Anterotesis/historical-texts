<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM many propo&s;itions di&s;per&s;ed through
the writings of the ancient geometers, and
more e&s;pecially from one whole treati&s;e, it
appears, that the proce&s;s, by which they
inve&s;tigated the &s;olutions of their problems, was for
the mo&s;t part the rever&s;e of the method, whereby
they demon&s;trated tho&s;e &s;olutions. But what they
have delivered upon the tangents of curve lines, and
the men&s;uration of curvilinear &s;paces, does not fall
under this ob&s;ervation; for the analy&s;is, they made
u&s;e of in the&s;e ca&s;es, is no where to be met with in
their works. In later times, indeed, a method for
inve&s;tigating &s;uch kind of problems has been in|troduced,
by con&s;idering all curves, as compo&s;ed of
an infinite number of indivi&s;ible &s;treight lines, and
curvilinear &s;paces, as compo&s;ed in the like manner
of parallelograms. But this being an ob&s;cure and in|di&s;tinct
conception, it was obnoxious to error.</P>
<P>SIR I&s;aac Newton therefore, to avoid the imper|fection,
with which this method of indivi&s;ibles was
ju&s;tly charg'd, in&s;tituted an analy&s;is for the&s;e pro|blems
upon other principles. Con&s;idering magni|tudes
not under the notion of being increa&s;ed by a
repeated acce&s;&s;ion of parts, but as generated by a
continued motion or flux; he di&s;covered a me|thod
to compare together the velocities, wherewith
<PB N="2" REF="5">
homogeneous magnitudes increa&s;e, and thereby has
taught an analy&s;is free from all ob&s;curity and indi|&s;tinctne&s;s.</P>
<P>MOREOVER to facilitate the demon&s;trations for
the&s;e kinds of problems, he invented a &s;ynthetic form
of rea&s;oning from the prime and ultimate ratios of the
contemporaneous augments, or decrements of tho&s;e
magnitudes, which is much more conci&s;e than the
method of demon&s;trating u&s;ed in the&s;e ca&s;es by the
ancients, yet is equally di&s;tinct and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>OF this analy&s;is, called by Sir I&s;aac Newton his
method of fluxions, and of his doctrine of prime and
ultimate ratios, I intend to write in the en&s;uing di&s;|cour&s;e.
For though Sir I&s;aac Newton has very di|&s;tinctly
explained both the&s;e &s;ubjects, the fir&s;t in his
treati&s;e on the Quadrature of curves, and the other in
his Mathematical principles of natural philo&s;ophy;
yet as the author's great brevity has made a more
diffu&s;ive illu&s;tration not altogether unnece&s;&s;ary; I
have here endeavoured to con&s;ider more at large
each of the&s;e methods; whereby, I hope, it will
appear, they have all the accuracy of the &s;tricte&s;t
mathematical demon&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD>OF FLUXIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the method of fluxions geometrical mag|nitudes
are not pre&s;ented to the mind, as
compleatly formed at once, but as ri&s;ing
gradually before the imagination by the mo|tion
of &s;ome of their extremes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newt. Introd ad Quad. Curv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS the line AB may be conceived to be tra|ced
out gradu|ally
by a point moving on
from A to B, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>either with an equable motion, or
with a velocity in any manner varied. And the
velocity, or degree of &s;wiftne&s;s, with which this
point moves in any part of the line, AB, is called
the fluxion of this line at that place.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uppo&s;e two lines AB and AC to form
a &s;pace unbounded
toward BC; and
upon AB a line DE
to be erected.<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>NOW, if this
line DE be put in motion (&s;uppo&s;e &s;o
as to keep always parallel to it&s;elf,) as &s;oon as it</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">
has pa&s;&s;ed the point A, a &s;pace bounded on all &s;ides
will begin to appear between the&s;e three lines. For
in&s;tance, when DE is
moved into the &s;itua|tion
FG, the&s;e three
lines will include the
&s;pace AFH. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Here
it is evident, that this
&s;pace will increa&s;e fa|&s;ter
or &s;lower, ac|cording
to the degree
of velocity, where|with
the line DE &s;hall
move. It is al&s;o evi|dent,
that though the
line DE &s;hould move
with an even pace, the
&s;pace AFH would
not for that rea&s;on in|crea&s;e
equably; but where the line AC was farthe&s;t di&s;tant from AB,
the &s;pace AFH would increa&s;e fa&s;te&s;t. Now the
velocity or celerity, wherewith the &s;pace AFH
at all times increa&s;es, is called the fluxion of that
&s;pace.</P>
<P>HERE it is obvious, that the velocity, wherewith
the &s;pace augments, is not to be under&s;tood lite|rally
the degree of &s;wiftne&s;s, with which either the
line FG, or any other line or point appertaining
to the curve actually moves; but as this &s;pace, while
the line FG moves on uniformity, will increa&s;e
more, in the &s;ame portion of time, at &s;ome places,
than at others; the terms velocity and celerity are
<PB N="5" REF="8">
applied in a figurative &s;en&s;e to denote the degree,
wherewith this augmentation in every part proceeds.</P>
<P>BUT we may dive&s;t the con&s;ideration of the fluxi|on
of the &s;pace from this figurative phra&s;e, by cau|&s;ing
a point &s;o to pa&s;s over any &s;treight line IK,
that the length IL mea&s;ured out, while the line
DE is moving from A to F, &s;hall augment in the
&s;ame proportion with the &s;pace AFH. For
this line being thus de&s;cribed fa&s;ter or &s;lower in
the &s;ame proportion, as the &s;pace receives its aug|mentation;
the velocity or degree of &s;wiftne&s;s,
wherewith the point de&s;cribing this line actually
mores, will mark out the degree of celerity, where|with
the &s;pace every where increa&s;es. And here
the line IL will pre&s;erve always the &s;ame analogy
to the &s;pace AFH, in &s;o much, that, when the line
DE is advanced into any other &s;ituation MNO,
if IP be to IL in the proportion of the &s;pace
AMN to the &s;pace AFH, the fluxion of the &s;pace
at MN will be to the fluxion thereof at FH, as
the velocity, wherewith the point de&s;cribing the
line IK moves at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, to the velocity of the &s;ame
at L. And if any other &s;pace QRST be de&s;cribed
along with the former by the like motion, and at
the &s;ame time a line VW, &s;o that the portion VX
&s;hall always have to the length IL the &s;ame propor|tion,
as the &s;pace QRST bears to the &s;pace AFH;
the fluxion of this latter &s;pace at TS will be to the
fluxion of the former at FH, as the velocity, where|with
the line VW is de&s;cribed at X, to the velocity,
wherewith IK is de&s;cribed at L. It will hereafter
appear, that in all the applications of fluxions to geo|metrical
problems, where &s;paces are concerned, no|thing
<PB N="6" REF="9">
more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to determine the ve|locity
wherewith &s;uch lines as the&s;e are de&s;cribed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner may a &s;olid &s;pace be concei|ved
to augment with a continual flux, by the mo|tion
of &s;ome plane, whereby it is bounded; and
the velocity of its augmentation (which may be e&s;ti|mated
in like manner) will be the fluxion of that
&s;olid.</P>
<P>FLUXIONS then in general are the ve|locities,
with which magnitudes varying by a con|tinued
motion increa&s;e or dimini&s;h; and the mag|nitudes
them&s;elves are reciprocally called the fluents
of th&s;e fluxions <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters"> vel incrementorum velocitates nominando fluxi|ones, &amp; quantitates genitas nominando fluentes. Newton. Introd. ad Quadr. Curv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND as different fluents may be under&s;tood to
be de&s;cribed together in &s;uch manner, as con&s;tant|ly
to pre&s;erve &s;ome one known relation to each
other; the doctrine of fluxions teaches, how to
a&s;&s;ign at all times the proportion between the ve|locities,
wherewith homogeneous magnitudes, vary|ing
thus together, augment or dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine al&s;o reaches on the other hand,
how from the relation known between the fluxions,
to di&s;cover what relation the fluents them&s;elves,
bear to each other.</P>
<P>IT is by means of this proportion only, that
fluxions are applied to geometrical, u&s;es;, for this
<PB N="7" REF="10">
doctrine never requires any determinate degree of
velocity to be a&s;&s;igned for the fluxion of any one
fluent. And that the proportion between the fluxi|ons
of magnitudes is a&s;&s;ignable from the relation
known between the magnitudes them&s;elves, I now
proceed to &s;hew.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, let us &s;uppo&s;e two lines AB and
CD to be de|&s;cribed toge|ther
by two
points, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>one
&s;etting out
from A, and the other from C, and to move in &s;uch
manner, that if AE and CF are lengths de&s;cribed
in the &s;ame time, CF &s;hall be analogous to &s;ome
power of AE, that is, if AE be denoted by the
letter <HI>x,</HI> then CF &s;hall always be denoted by <GAP DESC="math">;
where <HI>a</HI> repre&s;ents &s;ome given line, and <HI>n</HI> any num|ber
whatever. Here, I &s;ay, the proportion be|tween
the velocity of the point moving on AB to
the velocity of that moving on CD, is at all times
a&s;&s;ignable.</P>
<P>FOR let any other &s;ituations, that the&s;e moving
points &s;hall have at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, be ta|ken,
either farther advanced from E and F, as at
G and H, or &s;hort of the &s;ame, as at I and K;
then if EG be denoted by <HI>e,</HI> CH, the length
pa&s;&s;ed over by the point moving on the line CD,
while the point in the line AB has pa&s;&s;ed from A
<PB N="8" REF="11">
to G, will be expre&s;&s;ed by <GAP DESC="math">; and if EI be
denoted by <HI>e,</HI> CK, the length pa&s;&s;ed over by the
point moving on the line CD, while the point mo|ving
in AB has got only to I, will be denoted by
<GAP DESC="math">: or reducing each of the&s;e terms into a
&s;eries, CH will be denoted by <GAP DESC="math"> and CK by <GAP DESC="math">. Hence all the
terms of the former &s;eries, except the fir&s;t term, <HI>viz.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math"> will denote FH;
and all the latter &s;eries, except the fir&s;t term. <HI>viz.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math"> will denote KF.</P>
<P>WHEN the number <HI>n</HI> is greater than unite,
while the line AB is de&s;cribed with a uniform mo|tion,
the point, wherewith CD is de&s;cribed, moves
with a velocity continually accelerated; for if IE
be equal to EG, FH will be greater than KF.</P>
<P>NOW here, I &s;ay, that neither the propor|tion
of FH to EG, nor the proportion of KF
to IE is the proportion of the velocity, which the
point moving on CD has at F, to the uniform
<PB N="9" REF="12">
velocity, wherewith the point moves on the line
AB. For, while that point is advanced from E
to G,<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the point mov|ing
on CD has pa&s;&s;ed
from F
to H, and has moved through that &s;pace with a
velocity continually accelerated; therefore, if it
had moved during the &s;ame interval of time with
the velocity, it has at F, uniformly continued, it
would not have pa&s;&s;ed over &s;o long a line; con|&s;equently
FH bears a greater proportion to EG,
than what the velocity, which the point moving on
CD has at F, bears to the velocity of the point
moving uniformly on AB.</P>
<P>IN like manner KF bears to IE a le&s;s propor|tion
than that, which the velocity of the point in
CD has at F, to the velocity of that in AB. For
as the point in CD, in moving from K to F, pro|ceeds
with a velocity continually accelerated; with
the velocity, it has acquired at F, if uniformly con|tinued,
it would de&s;cribe in the &s;ame &s;pace of time
a line longer than KF.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place I &s;ay, that no line whatever,
that &s;hall be greater or le&s;s than the line repre&s;en|ted
by the &s;econd term of the foregoing &s;eries (<HI>viz.</HI>
the term <GAP DESC="math">) will bear to the line denoted
by <HI>e</HI> the &s;ame proportion, as the velocity, where|with
the point moves at F, bears to the velocity of
the point moving in the line AB; but that the ve|locity
at F is to that at E as <GAP DESC="math"> to <HI>e,</HI> or as
<GAP DESC="math"> to <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
IF po&s;&s;ible let the velocity at F bear to the velo|city
at E a greater ratio than this, &s;uppo&s;e the ratio
of <HI>p</HI> to <HI>q.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;eries, whereby CH is denoted, the line
<HI>e</HI> can be taken &s;o &s;mall, that any term propo&s;ed
in the &s;eries &s;hall exceed all
the following
terms toge|ther;

at F to the velocity at E, which is ab&s;urd; for it
has above been &s;hewn, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e ratios
is greater than the la&s;t. Therefore the velocity at
F cannot bear to the velocity at E any greater
proportion than that of <GAP DESC="math"> to <HI>e.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other hand, if po&s;&s;ible, let the velocity

But in all the&s;e ca&s;es the demon&s;tration
proceeds in like manner:</P>

the variations, to which the&s;e velocities are &s;ub|ject.</P>

Sir I&s;aac Newton calls the fluxion of the fluxi|on,
and al&s;o the &s;econd fluxion of the fluent; di|&s;tingui&s;hing
the fluxions, we have hitherto treated
of, by the name of the fir&s;t fluxions. The&s;e &s;econd

<P>IN the two fluents AE and CF, who&s;e fluxions
we compared at page 7, &amp;c. where AE being deno|ted
by <HI>x,</HI> CF was equal to
<GAP DESC="math">, and the
fluxion of AE bore to the fluxion of CF the proportion of <GAP DESC="math">

</FIGURE>Here it is evident, that the antecedent
<GAP DESC="math"> of this proportion being a fix'd quantity, and
the con&s;equent <GAP DESC="math"> a variable one; the fluxion
of AE does not bear to the fluxion of CF always
the &s;ame proportion. If <HI>n</HI> be the number 2, the
fluxion of AE is to the fluxion of CF as <HI>a</HI> to the

the fluxion of AE to that of CF will be as <HI>a</HI>^2 to

unite, CF is &s;o de&s;cribed with a velocity continually
accelerating, that when <HI>n</HI> is &equals; 2, this velocity aug|ments
in the &s;ame proportion as CF it&s;elf increa&s;es;
and when <HI>n</HI> is &equals; 3, it augments in the duplicate of
that proportion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we &s;ee, that while one quan|tity
flows uniformly, the other is de&s;cribed with a
varying motion; and the variation in this motion
is called the &s;econd fluxion of this quantity.</P>
<P>IT is evident farther, that in this in&s;tance, when
<HI>n</HI> is &equals; 2, the variation of the velocity is uniform:
for the velocity keeping always in the &s;ame propor|tion
to <HI>x,</HI> while <HI>x</HI> increa&s;es uniformly, the velocity
mu&s;t al&s;o increa&s;e after the &s;ame manner. But when <HI>n</HI>
is &equals; 3; &s;ince the velocity is every where as <HI>x</HI>^2, and <HI>x</HI>^2
does not increa&s;e uniformly; neither will the velo|city
augment uniformly. So that it appears by this
example, that the variation in the velocity, where|with
magnitudes increa&s;e, may al&s;o vary, and this
variation is called the third fluxion of the magni|tude.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner may the fluxions of the fol|lowing
orders be conceived; each order being the
variation found in the preceeding one. And the
con&s;ideration of velocities thus perpetually varying,
and their variation it&s;elf changing, is a u&s;eful &s;pe|culation;
for mo&s;t, if not all, the bodies, we have
<PB N="31" REF="34">
any acquaintance with, do actually move with ve|locities
thus modified.</P>
<P>A STONE, for in&s;tance, in its direct fall towards
the earth has its velocity perpetually augmented;
and in Galileo's Theory of falling Bodies, when
the whole de&s;cent is performed near the &s;urface of
the earth, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to receive equal augmen|tations
of velocity in equal times. In this ca&s;e
therefore the velocity augments uniformly, and the
&s;econd fluxion of the line de&s;cribed by the falling bo|dy
will in all parts of that line be the &s;ame; &s;o that
third fluxions cannot take place in this in&s;tance;
&s;ince the variation of the velocity &s;uffers no change,
but is every where uniform.</P>
<P>BUT if the &s;tone be &s;uppo&s;ed to have its gravity
at the beginning of its fall le&s;s than at the &s;urface
of the earth, the variation of its velocity at fir&s;t
will then be le&s;s than the variation at the end of
its motion; or in other words, the &s;econd fluxions
in the beginning and end of its fall would be une|qual;
con&s;equently, third fluxions would here take
place, &s;ince the variation would be &s;wifter, as the
body in its fall approached the earth.</P>
<P>THE &s;tone in this la&s;t in&s;tance then not only
moves with a velocity perpetually varying, as in
the preceeding example, but this variation conti|nually
changes. In the true theory of falling bo|dies,
neither this la&s;t variation nor any &s;ub&s;equent
one can ever be uniform; &s;o that fluxions of every

in different parts, the&s;e &s;uperior orders of fluxions
are u&s;eful; for by the inflexion of the curve, whil&s;t
its ab&s;ci&s;&s;e flows uniformly, the fluxion of the or|dinate
mu&s;t continually vary, and thereby will be
attended with the&s;e &s;uperior orders of fluxions.</P>
<P>FOR example, were it required to compare the
different degrees of curvature either of different

degree of curvature might be the &s;ame with that
of any curve propo&s;ed, in any point, that &s;hould
be a&s;&s;igned; &s;uch a circle may be found by the
help of &s;econd fluxions. When the ab&s;ci&s;&s;es of
two curves flow with equal velocity; where the
ordinates have equal fir&s;t fluxions, the tangent;
make equal angles with their re&s;pective ordinates.
If now the &s;econd fluxions of the&s;e ordinates are al|&s;o
equal, the curves in tho&s;e points mu&s;t be equally
<PB N="39" REF="42">
deflected from their tangents, that is, have equal
degrees of curvature. Upon this principle &s;uch
circles, as have here been mentioned, may be found
by the following method.</P>
<P>THE curve ABC being given, let it be required
to find a circle equally incurvated with this curve at

the tangent FH at the point F makes with the or|dinate

the ordinate BL of that curve. Now if the two ab|&s;ci&s;&s;es
AL and EI are de&s;cribed with equal veloci|ties,
the fir&s;t fluxion of the ordinates LB and IF will
be equal; and therefore, if the two curves are equally
incurvated at the points B and F, the &s;econd fluxi|ons
of the&s;e ordinates will be al&s;o equal. If M be

fluxion of IF will be to the fluxion of MI, or of
<HI>x,</HI> as <HI>x</HI> to <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e the line NO to be &s;o de&s;cribed,
that the fluxion of MI, or of <HI>x,</HI> &s;hall be to the
fir&s;t fluxion of IF, as &s;ome given line <HI>e</HI> to NP in
the line NO, then will NP be &equals; <GAP DESC="math">.
Suppo&s;e likewi&s;e the lines QR to be &s;o de&s;cribed,
that the fluxion of AL in the curve ABC &s;hall be
to the fir&s;t fluxion of LB, as the &s;ame given line <HI>e</HI>
to QS in the line QR. Here the fir&s;t fluxions
of IF and LB being equal, NP and QS are equal.
And &s;ince the &s;econd fluxions of IF and LB are
equal, the fluxions of NP and QS are al&s;o equal.
But NP was &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, and by the rules for
finding fluxions, the fluxion of NP will be to the
fluxion of MI as <HI>eaa</HI> to <GAP DESC="math">, that is, as
<HI>e</HI> &times; EM<HI>q</HI> to IF<HI>c.</HI> Therefore in the curve ABC
the fluxion of QS to the fluxion of AL will be in

by finding fir&s;t QS, then its fluxion, from the e|quation
expre&s;&s;ing the nature of the curve ABC, the

<PB N="41" REF="44">
be given, who&s;e curvature is equal to the curvature
of the curve ABC at the point B.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the curve ABC to be the conical pa|rabola,
where AL<HI>q</HI> &s;hall be equal to &ggr; &times; LB, &ggr; be|ing
the latus rectum of the axis. Here <HI>e</HI> will be to
QS as &ggr; to 2 AL; for that is the ratio of the fluxi|on
of AL to the fluxion of BL: therefore QS is
<FIGURE>

&equals; <GAP DESC="math"> AL, and con&s;equently the fluxion of QS
to the fluxion of AL (that is <HI>e</HI> &times; EM<HI>q</HI> to IF<HI>c</HI>)

&s;o much that IF<HI>c</HI> is &equals; &frac12; &ggr; &times; EM<HI>q,</HI> and the given

that is, IF is equal to half the latus rectum apper|taining
<PB N="42" REF="45">
to the diameter of the parabola, who&s;e ver|tex
is the point B.</P>
<P>THIS is all we think nece&s;&s;ary towards giving
a ju&s;t and clear idea of the nature of fluxions,
and for proving the certainty of the deductions
made from them. For it mu&s;t now be manife&s;t to
every reader, that mathematical quantities become
the proper object of this doctrine of fluxions, when|ever
they are &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e by any continued
motion of prolongation, dilatation, expan&s;ion or
other kind of augmentation, provided &s;uch augmen|tation
be directed by &s;ome general rule, whence
the mea&s;ure of the increa&s;e of the&s;e quantities may
from time to time be e&s;timated. And when different
homogeneous magnitudes increa&s;e after this manner
together, one may vary fa&s;ter than another. Now
the velocity of increa&s;e in each quantity, is the
fluxion of that quantity. This is the true inter|pretation
of Sir I&s;aac Newton's appellation of fluxi|ons,
Incrementorum velocitates. For this doctrine
does not &s;uppo&s;e the fluents them&s;elves to have
any motion. Fluxions are not the velocities, with
which the fluents, or even the increments, which
tho&s;e fluents receive, are them&s;elves moved; but
the degrees of velocity, wherewith tho&s;e increments
are generated. Subjects incapable of local motion,
&s;uch as fluxions them&s;elves, may al&s;o have their
fluxions. In this we do not a&s;cribe to the&s;e fluxi|ons
any actual motion; for to a&s;cribe motion, or
velocity to what is it&s;elf only a, velocity, would
be wholly unintelligible. The fluxion of another
fluxion is only a variation in the velocity, which is
<PB N="43" REF="46">
that fluxion. In &s;hort, light, heat, &s;ound, the mo|tion
of bodies, the power of gravity, and whatever
el&s;e is capable of variation, and of having that va|riation
a&s;&s;igned, for this rea&s;on comes under the
pre&s;ent doctrine; nothing more being under&s;tood
by the fluxion of any &s;ubject, than the degree of
&s;uch its variation.</P>
<P>TO a&s;&s;ign the velocities of variation or increa&s;e
in different homogeneous quantities, it is nece&s;&s;ary
to compare the degrees of augmentation, which tho&s;e
quantities receive in equal portions of time; and in
this doctrine of fluxions no farther u&s;e is made of
&s;uch increments: for the application of this doctrine
to geometrical problems depends upon the know|ledge
of the&s;e velocities only. But the con&s;idera|tion
of the increments them&s;elves may be made
&s;ub&s;ervient to the like u&s;es upon other principles;
the explanation of which leads us to the &s;econd part
of our de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>OF PRIME and ULTIMATE RATIOS.</HEAD>
<P>THE primary method of comparing together
the magnitudes of rectilinear &s;paces is by lay|ing
them one upon another: thus all the right lined
&s;paces, which in the fir&s;t book of Euclide are pro|ved
to be equal, are the &s;um or difference of &s;uch
&s;paces, as would cover one another. This method
cannot be applied in comparing curvilinear &s;paces
with rectilinear ones; becau&s;e no part whatever of
a curve line can be laid upon a &s;treight line, &s;o as
wholly to coincide with it. For this purpo&s;e there|fore
the ancient geometers made u&s;e of a method
of rea&s;oning, &s;ince commonly called the method of
exhau&s;tions; which con&s;i&s;ts in de&s;cribing upon the
curvilinear &s;pace a rectilinear one, which though not
equal to the other, yet might differ le&s;s from it
than by any the mo&s;t minute difference whatever,
that &s;hould be propo&s;ed; and thereby proving, the
two &s;paces, they would compare, could be neither
greater nor le&s;s than each other.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">
FOR example, in order to prove the equality be|tween
the &s;pace comprehended within the circum|ference
of a circle, and a triangle, who&s;e ba&s;e &s;hould
be equal to the circumference of that circle, and
its altitude to the &s;emidiameter, Archimedes takes this
method. About the circle he de&s;cribes a polygon
as ABC, and makes it appear, that by multiplying
the &s;ides of this polygon, there may at length be
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
de&s;cribed &s;uch an one, as &s;hall exceed the circle le&s;s
than by any difference, that &s;hall be propo&s;ed, how
minute &s;oever that difference be. By this means it
was ea&s;y to prove, that the triangle DEF, who&s;e
ba&s;e EF &s;hould be equal to the circumference of
the circle, and altitude ED equal to the &s;emidia|meter,
is not greater than the circle. For were it
greater, how &s;mall &s;oever be the exce&s;s, it were po&s;|&s;ible
to de&s;cribe about the circle a polygon le&s;s than
the triangle; but the circumference of the polygon
is greater than the circumference of the circle, there|fore
the polygon can never be le&s;s, but mu&s;t be
always greater than the triangle; for the polygon
<PB N="46" REF="49">
is equal to a triangle, who&s;e altitude is the &s;emidiame|ter
of the circle, and ba&s;e equal to the circumference
of the polygon. It appears therefore impo&s;&s;ible for
the triangle DEF to be greater than the circle.</P>
<P>THUS far Archimedes makes u&s;e of the polygon
circum&s;cribing the circle and no farther: but in&s;cri|bing
another within the circle he proves, by a &s;imi|lar
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the
triangle to be le&s;s than the circle; whereby at
length it becomes certain, that the triangle DEF
is neither greater nor le&s;s than the circle, but equal
to it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the triangle may be proved not to
be le&s;s than the circle by the circum&s;cribed polygon
al&s;o. For were it le&s;s, another triangle DEG,
who&s;e ba&s;e EG is greater than EF, might be ta|ken,
which &s;hould not be greater than the circle.
But a polygon can be circum&s;cribed about the cir|cle,
the circumference of which &s;hall exceed the
circumference of the circle by le&s;s than any line, that
<PB N="47" REF="50">
can be named, con&s;equently by le&s;s than FG, that
is, the circumference of the polygon &s;hall be le&s;s than
EG, and the polygon le&s;s than the triangle DEG;
therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible, that this triangle &s;hould
not exceed the circle, &s;ince it is greater than the
polygon: con&s;equently the triangle DEF cannot be le&s;s than the circle.</P>
<P>THUS the circle and triangle may be proved
to be equal by comparing them with one polygon
only, and Sir I&s;aac Newton has in&s;tituted upon
this principle a briefer method of conception and
expre&s;&s;ion for demon&s;trating this &s;ort of propo&s;itions,
than what was u&s;ed by the ancients; and his ideas
are equally di&s;tinct, and adequate to the &s;ubject,
with theirs, though more complex. It became the
fir&s;t writers to choo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;imple form of
expre&s;&s;ion, and the lea&s;t compounded ideas po&s;&s;ible.
But Sir I&s;aac Newton thought, he &s;hould oblige
the mathematicians by u&s;ing brevity, provided he
introduced no modes of conception difficult to be
comprehended by tho&s;e, who are not un&s;killed in
the ancient methods of writing.</P>
<P>THE conci&s;e form, into which Sir I&s;aac New|ton
has ca&s;t his demon&s;trations, may very po&s;&s;ibly
create a difficulty of apprehen&s;ion in the minds of
&s;ome unexerci&s;ed in the&s;e &s;ubjects. But otherwi&s;e
his method of demon&s;trating by the prime and
ultimate ratios of varying magnitudes is not only
ju&s;t, and free from any defect in it&s;elf; but ea&s;ily
to be comprehended, at lea&s;t by tho&s;e who have

AB and BE is for this rea&s;on called the

it is the proportion, which tho&s;e quadrila|terals
can never actually have to each other, but
the limit of that proportion.</P>
<P>THE quadrilaterals may be continually dimini|&s;hed,
either by dividing BC in any known propor|tion

DF may be &s;uppo&s;ed to advance towards AE
with an uninterrupted motion, 'till the quadrila|terals
quite di&s;appear, or vani&s;h. And under this

be called vani&s;hing quantities, &s;ince they are now
con&s;idered, as never having any &s;table magnitude,

ABCD to the quadrilateral BEFC, while
the quadrilaterals dimini&s;h, approaches to that of
AB to BE in &s;uch manner, that this ratio of AB
to BE is the neare&s;t limit, that can be a&s;&s;igned to
the other; it is by no means a forced conception to
con&s;ider the ratio of AB to BE under the notion
of the ratio, wherewith the quadrilaterals vani&s;h;

<P>THE reader will perceive, I am endeavouring

the Latin participle evane&s;cens, by the En|gli&s;h
one vani&s;hing, and not by the word evane&s;cent,
which having the form of a noun adjective, does
not &s;o certainly imply that motion, which ought
here to be kept carefully in mind. The quadri|laterals
ABCD, BEFC become vani&s;hing quan|tities
from the time, we fir&s;t a&s;cribe to them this
perpetual diminution; that is, from that time they
are quantities going to vani&s;h. And as during their

WE &s;ee here the &s;ame ratio may be called &s;ome|times
the prime, at other times the ultimate ratio
of the &s;ame varying quantities, as the&s;e quantities
are con&s;idered either under the notion of vani&s;hing,
or of being produced before the imagination by an
uninterrupted motion. The doctrine under exami|nation
receives its name from both the&s;e ways of
epxpre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THUS we have given a general idea of the
manner of conception, upon which this doctrine is
built. But as in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e we
confirmed the doctrine of fluxions by demon&s;tra|tions
of the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial kind; &s;o here, to
remove all di&s;tru&s;t concerning the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of
this method of rea&s;oning, we &s;hall draw out its
fir&s;t principles into a more diffu&s;ive form.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e, we &s;hall in the fir&s;t place
define an ultimate magnitude to be the limit, to
which a varying magnitude can approach within
any degree of nearne&s;s whatever, though it can
never be made ab&s;olutely equal to it.</P>
<P>THUS the circle di&s;cour&s;ed of above, accord|ing
to this definition, is to be called the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon circum&s;cribing it; be|cau&s;e
this polygon, by increasing the number of its
&s;ides, can be made to differ from the circle, le&s;s
than by any &s;pace, that can be propo&s;ed how &s;mall
<PB N="54" REF="57">
&s;oever; and yet the polygon can never become ei|ther
equal to the circle or le&s;s.</P>
<P>IN like manner the circle will be the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon in&s;cribed, with this dif|ference
only, that as in the fir&s;t ca&s;e the vary|ing
magnitude is always greater, here it will
be le&s;s than the ultimate magnitude, which is its
limit.</P>
<P>AGAIN the triangle DEF is the ultimate mag|nitude
of the triangle DEG; becau&s;e the ba&s;e EG,
being always equal to the circumference of the po|lygon,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
will con&s;tantly be greater than the ba&s;e EF,
equal to the circumference of the circle only, and
yet EG may be made to approach EF nearer than
by any difference, that can be named.</P>
<P>UPON this definition we may ground the fol|lowing
propo&s;ition; That, when varying magni|tudes
<PB N="55" REF="58">
keep con&s;tantly the &s;ame proportion to each
other, their ultimate magnitudes are in the &s;ame
proportion.</P>
<P>LET A and B be two varying magnitudes,
which keep con&s;tantly in the &s;ame proportion to
each other; and let C be the ultimate magnitude
of A, and D the ultimate magnitude of B. I &s;ay
that C is to D in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>AS A is a varying magnitude continually ap|proaching
to C, but can never become equal to it,
A may be either always greater or always le&s;s than
C. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>In the fir&s;t place &s;uppo&s;e it
greater. When A is greater than
C, in approaching to C it is con|tinually
dimini&s;hed; therefore B
keeping always in the &s;ame pro|portion
to A, B in approaching
to its limit D is al&s;o continually dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>NOW, if po&s;&s;ible, let the ratio of C to D be
greater than that of A to B, that is, &s;uppo&s;e C to
have to &s;ome magnitude E, greater than D, the
&s;ame proportion as A has to B. Since C is the ul|timate
magnitude of A in the &s;en&s;e of the preceed|ing
definition, A can be made to approach nearer
to C than by any difference, that can be propo&s;ed,
but can never become equal to it, or le&s;s. There|fore,
&s;ince C is to E as A to B, B will always ex|ceed
E; con&s;equently can never approach to D &s;o
near as by the exce&s;s of E above D: which is ab|&s;urd.
For &s;ince D is &s;uppo&s;ed the ultimate mag|nitude
<PB N="56" REF="59">
of B, it can be approached by B nearer than
by any a&s;&s;ignable difference.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ame manner, neither can the ratio
of D to C be greater than that of B to A.</P>
<P>IF the varying magnitude A be le&s;s than C, it
follows, in like manner, that neither the ratio of C
to D can be le&s;s than that of A to B, nor the ratio
of D to C le&s;s than that of B to A.</P>
<P>IT is an evident corollary from this propo&s;ition,
that the ultimate magnitudes of the &s;ame or equal
varying magnitudes are equal.</P>
<P>NOW from this propo&s;ition the fore-mentioned
equality between the circle and triangle DEF will
again readily appear. For the circle being the ul|timate
magnitude of the polygon, and the triangle
DEF the ultimate magnitude of the triangle
DEG; &s;ince the polygon and the triangle DEG
are equal, by this propo&s;ition the circle and triangle
DEF will be al&s;o equal.</P>
<P>IF the preceeding propo&s;ition be admitted, as a
genuine deduction from the definition, upon which
it is grounded; this demon&s;tration of the equality
of the circle and triangle cannot be excepted to.
For no objection can lie again&s;t the definition it&s;elf,
as no inference is there deduced, but only the &s;en&s;e
explained of the term defined in it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60">
THE other part of this method, which concerns
varying ratios, may be put into the &s;ame form by
defining ultimate ratios as follows.</P>
<P>IF there be two quantities, that are (one or both)
continually varying, either by being continually
augmented, or continually dimini&s;hed; and if the
proportion, they bear to each other, does by this
means perpetually vary, but in &s;uch a manner, that
it con&s;tantly approaches nearer and nearer to &s;ome
determined proportion, and can al&s;o be brought at
la&s;t in its approach nearer to this determined pro|portion
than to any other, that can be a&s;&s;igned,
but can never pa&s;s it: this determined proportion
is then called the ultimate proportion, or the ulti|mate
ratio of tho&s;e varying quantities.</P>
<P>TO this definition of the &s;en&s;e, in which the
term ultimate ratio, or ultimate proportion is to
be under&s;tood, we mu&s;t &s;ubjoin the following pro|po&s;ition:
That all the ultimate ratios of the &s;ame
varying ratio are the &s;ame with each other.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the ratio of A to B continually varies
by the variation of one or both of the terms A and
B. If the ratio of C to D be the ultimate ratio of
A to B, and the ratio of E to F be likewi&s;e the
ultimate ratio of the &s;ame; I &s;ay, the ratio of C
to D is the &s;ame with the ratio of E to F.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">
IF po&s;&s;ible, let the ratio of E to F differ from
that of C to D. Since the ratio of C to D is the
ultimate ratio of A to B, the ratio of A to B, in its
approach to that of C to D, can be brought at la&s;t
nearer to it, than to any other whatever. Therefore
if the ratio of E to F differ from that of C to D,
the ratio of A to B will either pa&s;s that of E to F,
or can never approach &s;o near to it, as to the ratio
of C to D: in &s;o much that the ratio of E to F
cannot be the ultimate ratio of A to B, in the &s;en&s;e
of this definition.</P>
<P>THE two definitions here &s;et down, together
with the general propo&s;itions annexed to them, com|prehend
the whole foundation of this method, we
are now explaining.</P>
<P>WE find in former writers &s;ome attempts toward
&s;o much of this method, as depends upon the fir&s;t
definition. Lucas Valerius in a mo&s;t excellent trea|ti&s;e
on the Center of gravity of &s;olid bodies, has
given a propo&s;ition nothing different, but in the
form of the expre&s;&s;ion, from that we have &s;ubjoin|ed
to our fir&s;t definition; from which he demon|&s;trates
with brevity and elegance his propo&s;itions con|cerning
the men&s;uration and center of gravity of the
&s;phere, &s;pheroid, parabolical and hyperbolical co|noids.
This author writ before the doctrine of in|divi&s;ibles
was propo&s;ed to the world. And &s;ince,
Andrew Tacquet, in his treati&s;e on the Cylindrical
and annular &s;olids, has made the &s;ame propo&s;ition,
though &s;omething differently expre&s;&s;ed, the ba&s;is
<PB N="59" REF="62">
of his demon&s;trations at the &s;ame time very judi|ciou&s;ly
expo&s;ing the inconclu&s;ivene&s;s of the rea&s;on|ings
from indivi&s;ibles. However, the con&s;ideration
of the limits of varying proportions, when the quan|tities
expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e proportions have them&s;elves
no limits, which renders this method of prime and
ultimate ratios much more exten&s;ive, we owe in|tirely
to Sir I&s;aac Newton. That this method, as
thus compleated, is applicable not only to the &s;ub|jects
treated by the ancients in the method of ex|hau&s;tions,
but to many others al&s;o of the greate&s;t
importance, appears from our author's immortal
treati&s;e on the Mathematical principles of natural
philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we &s;hall farther illu&s;trate
this doctrine in applying it to the &s;ame general pro|blems
as tho&s;e, whereby the u&s;e of fluxions was
above exemplified.</P>
<P>WE have already given one in&s;tance of its u&s;e in
determining the dimen&s;ions of curvilinear &s;paces; we
&s;hall now &s;et forth the &s;ame by a more general ex|ample.</P>
<P>LET ABC be a curve line, its ab&s;ci&s;&s;e AD, and
an ordinate DB. If the parallelogram EFGH,
formed upon the given line EF under the &s;ame
angle, as the ordinates of the curve make with its
ab&s;ci&s;&s;e, be in all parts &s;o related to the curve, that
the ultimate ratio of any portion of the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e
AD to the corre&s;pondent portion of the line EH,
&s;hall be that of the given line EF to the ordinate
of the curve at the beginning of that portion of the
<PB N="60" REF="63">
ab&s;ci&s;&s;e then will the curvilinear &s;pace ADB be
equal to the parallelogram EG.</P>
<P>IN the curve let the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e AD be divided into
any number of equal parts AI, IL, LN, ND,
and let the ordinates IK, LM, NO be drawn,
and al&s;o in the parallelogram EG the corre&s;pondent
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
lines PQ, RS and TV. In the curve compleat
the parallelograms IW, LX, NY, and in the
parallelogram EG make the parallelogram PZ e|qual
to the parallelogram IW, the parallelogram
<PB N="61" REF="64">
R&Ggr; equal to LX, and the parallelogram T&Dgr; e|qual
to NY: then the whole figure IKWMXOYD
will be equal to the whole Figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H.
But in the curve, by increa&s;ing the number and di|mini&s;hing
the breadth of the&s;e parallelograms, the
figure IKWMXOYD will approach nearer and
nearer in magnitude to the curvilinear &s;pace ADB;
in &s;o much that their difference may be reduced to
le&s;s than any &s;pace, that &s;hall be a&s;&s;igned; there|fore
the curvilinear &s;pace ADB is the ultimate
magnitude of the figure IKWMXOYD. Far|ther,
&s;ince the parallelogram EG is in all parts &s;o
related to the curve, that the ultimate ratio of every
portion, as LN, of the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e AD to RT, the
corre&s;pondent portion of EH, is the &s;ame with
the ratio of EF or RS, to LM; the ultimate
ratio of the parallelogram LX, or its equal R&Ggr;,
to the parallelogram RV, is the ratio of equality.
This is al&s;o true of all the other corre&s;pondent pa|rallelograms;
therefore, the ultimate ratio of the
figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H to the parallelogram PG is the
ratio of equality; that is, the figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H, by
increa&s;ing the number of its parallelograms, can
be brought nearer to the parallelogram PG than
by any difference whatever, that may be propo&s;ed.
Moreover, by increa&s;ing of the number of ordi|nates
in the curve, the re&s;iduary portion AI of
the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e can be reduced to le&s;s than any magni|tude,
that &s;hall be propo&s;ed; whereby the paral|lelogram
EQ, corre&s;ponding to this portion of
the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e, may be al&s;o reduced to le&s;s than any
magnitude, that can be propo&s;ed; and the paral|lelogram
PG be brought to differ le&s;s from EG than by any a&s;&s;ignable magnitude. Since therefore the
<PB N="62" REF="65">
figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H can be brought nearer to the pa|rallelogram
PG than by any difference, that can be
a&s;&s;igned; the Figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H can be brought al&s;o
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
nearer to the parallelogram EG than by any differ|ence,
that can be a&s;&s;igned. Con&s;equently the pa|rallelogram
EG is the ultimate magnitude of the
figure PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H. Therefore the figures PZ&Ggr;&Dgr;H
and IK WMXOYD being equal varying mag|nitudes,
and the ultimate magnitudes of equal
varying magnitudes being equal, the curvilinear
&s;pace ADB is equal to the parallelogram EG.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">
SUPPOSE the curve ABC were a cubical para|bola
convex to the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e, that is, &s;uppo&s;e &THgr;
a given line, and &THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; LM &equals; AL <HI>c.</HI> If EH be

<P>As EH is &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, ER will be &equals; <GAP DESC="math">
and ET &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, con&s;equently RT &equals; <GAP DESC="math">.
Therefore the parallelogram EG is here &s;o related
in all parts to the curve, that LN is to RT as &THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; EF
to AL<HI>c</HI> &plus; &frac14; AL<HI>q</HI> &times; LN &plus; AL &times; LN<HI>q</HI> &plus; &frac14; LN<HI>c.</HI>
Now it is evident, that the ratio of LN to RT can
never be &s;o great as the ratio of &THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; EF to AL<HI>c</HI>;
but yet, by dimini&s;hing LN, the ratio of LN to
RT may at la&s;t be brought nearer to this ratio

Con&s;equently by the preceeding definition of
what is to be under&s;tood by an ultimate ratio, the
ratio of &THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; EF to AL<HI>c</HI> is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. But AL<HI>c</HI> being &equals; &THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; LM,
&THgr;<HI>q</HI> &times; EF is to AL<HI>c</HI> as EF to LM. Therefore
the ratio of EF to LM is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. Con&s;equently, by the preceeding ge|neral

to the curvilinear &s;pace ADB. And this paral|lelogram
is equal to &frac14; AD &times; DB.</P>

AGAIN this method is equally u&s;eful in deter|mining
the &s;ituation of the tangents to curve lines.</P>
<P>IN the curve ABC, who&s;e ab&s;ci&s;&s;e is AD, let
EB be a tangent at the point B. Let BF be the
ordinate at the &s;ame point B, and GH another or|dinate
paral|lel
to it, which &s;hall
meet the tan|gent
in I, and
the line BK,
parallel to
the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e
AD, in K.
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Here the ra|tio
of HK, the difference of the ordinates, to BK
can never be the &s;ame with the ratio of BF to FE,
unle&s;s by the figure of the curve the tangent chance
to cut it in &s;ome point remote from B; this ratio of
BF to FE being the &s;ame with that of IK to
KB. But it is farther evident, that the nearer GH
is to FB, the ratio of KH to KB will approach
&s;o much the nearer to the ratio of IK to KB;
and the angle, which the curve BC makes with
the tangent BI being le&s;s than any right-lined an|gle,
it is manife&s;t, that GH may be made to ap|proach
towards FB, 'till the ratio of HK to KB,
&s;hall at la&s;t approach nearer to the ratio of IK to
KB, or of BF to FE, than to any other ratio
whatever, that &s;hall be propo&s;ed; that is, the ra|tio
of BF to FE is the ultimate ratio of HK to
<PB N="65" REF="68">
KB. Therefore, if from the properties of the
curve ABC the ratio of HK to KB be determined,
and from thence their ultimate ratio a&s;&s;igned; this
ratio thus a&s;&s;igned will be the ratio of BF to FE;
becau&s;e all the ultimate ratios of the &s;ame variable
ratio are the &s;ame with each other.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the curve ABC again to be a cubical
parabola, where BF is &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, and GH =
<GAP DESC="math">. Here HK will be &equals; <GAP DESC="math">;
therefore HK is to FG, or BK, as 3 AF &times; AG &plus;
FG<HI>q</HI> to Z<HI>q.</HI> Con&s;equently the ratio of HK to BK
can never be &s;o &s;mall as the ratio of 3AF<HI>q</HI> to Z<HI>q</HI>;
but by dimini&s;hing BK it may be brought nearer to
that ratio, than to any other whatever; that is, the
ratio of 3AF<HI>q</HI> to Z<HI>q</HI> is the ultimate ratio of HK
to KB. Therefore, if BF bear to FE the ratio of 3AF<HI>q</HI> to Z<HI>q,</HI> the line BE will touch the curve
in B: and EF will be equal to &frac13; AF.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ituation of the tangent has been
thus determined, the magnitude of HI, the part
of the ordinate intercepted between the tangent and
the curve, will be known. For example, in this
in&s;tance &s;ince BF is to FE, that is IK to FG, as
3AF<HI>q</HI> to Z<HI>q,</HI> IK will be &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, and
HK being &equals; <GAP DESC="math">, HI will

Now by this line HI may the curvature of curve
lines be compared.</P>
<P>LET the &s;treight line AB touch the curve CBD
in the point B; CE being the ab&s;ci&s;&s;e of the curve,
and BF the ordinate at B. Take any other point
G in the curve, and through the points G, B de|&s;cribe
the circle BGH, that &s;hall touch the line AB

</FIGURE>
in B; la&s;tly, draw IKGL parallel to FB. Here are
two angles formed at the point B with the circle, one
by the line BK, the other by the curve; and the pro|portion
of the fir&s;t of the&s;e angles to the &s;econd will
be different in different di&s;tances of the point G from
the point B. And by the approach of G to B the
angle between the circle and curve will be dimini|&s;hed,
even &s;o much as at length to bear a le&s;s pro|portion
to the angle between the circle and tangent,
than any, that can be propo&s;ed. That is, by the
<PB N="67" REF="70">
approach of the point G to B the angle between the
tangent and circle may be brought nearer to the an|gle
between the tangent and the curve, than by any
difference how minute &s;oever homogeneous to tho&s;e
angles; therefore the magnitude of the circle being
continually varied by the gradual approach of G to
B, and the angle between the tangent and circle
thereby al&s;o varied; the angle between the tangent
and curve is the ultimate magnitude of the&s;e angles.
That is, the ultimate of the&s;e circles determines the
degree of curvature of the curve CBD at the point
B. But in the circle the rectangle under LKG is
equal to the &s;quare of BK. And whereas the mag|nitude
of KL will perpetually vary by the ap|proach
of the point G towards B; if BM taken in
FB produced be the ultimate magnitude of KL,
the circle de&s;cribed through M and B to touch the
tangent AK in B will be the circle, by which the cur|vature
of the curve CBD in B is to be e&s;timated.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the curve CBD to be the cubical pa|rabola
as before, where Z<HI>q</HI> &times; FB is &equals; CF<HI>c,</HI> then
KG will be &equals; <GAP DESC="math">. Hence LK
(&equals; <GAP DESC="math">) is &equals; <GAP DESC="math">. But it
is evident, that in a given &s;ituation of the tangent
AB the ratio of BK<HI>q</HI> to FI<HI>q</HI> is given; therefore
LK will be reciprocally as 3CF &plus; FI, and will
continually increa&s;e, as the point G approaches to
the point B, but can never be &s;o great, as to equal
<GAP DESC="math">; yet by the near approach of G
to B, LK may be brought nearer to this quantity
<PB N="68" REF="71">
than by any difference, that can be propo&s;ed.
Therefore, by our former definition of ultimate
magnitudes, <GAP DESC="math"> is the ultimate mag|nitude
of LK. Con&s;equently, if BM be taken
equal to this <GAP DESC="math">, the circle de&s;cribed

<HEAD>OF
Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S
METHOD
Of demon&s;trating his Rules for finding
FLUXIONS.</HEAD>
<P>SIR I&s;aac Newton has comprehended his di|rections
for computing the fluxions of quan|ties
in two propo&s;itions; one in his Introduction to
his treati&s;e on the Quadrature of curves; the other
is the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of the book it&s;elf. In the
fir&s;t he a&s;&s;igns the fluxion of a &s;imple power, the
latter is univer&s;al for all quantities whatever.</P>
<P>FOR determining the fluxion of a &s;imple power
&s;uppo&s;e the line
AB to be de|noted

by <HI>x,</HI> and
another line
CD to be de|noted
by <GAP DESC="math">, or by con&s;idering <HI>a</HI> as unite, CD
will be denoted by <HI>x</HI>^n.<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
SUPPOSE the points B and D to move in equal
&s;paces of time into two other po&s;itions E and F;
then DF will be to BE in the ratio of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be de&s;cribed with an uniform
motion, to the velocity, wherewith BE will be de&s;cri|bed
in the &s;ame time with an uniform motion. But
if the point de|&s;cribing the line
AB moves uni|formly;
the ve|locity,
where|with
the line CD is de&s;cribed, will not be uniform.
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>Therefore the &s;pace DF is not de&s;cribed with a
uniform velocity; in &s;o much that the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly de&s;cribed, is
never the &s;ame with the velocity at the point D.
But by dimini&s;hing the magnitude of DF, the uni|form
velocity, wherewith DF would be de&s;cribed,
may be made to approach at plea&s;ure to the velo|city
at the point D. Therefore the velocity at the
point D is the ultimate magnitude of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly de&s;cribed.
Con&s;equently the ratio of the velocity at D to the
velocity at B is the ultimate ratio of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly de&s;cribed, to
the velocity, wherewith BE is uniformly de&s;cribed.
But DF being to BE as the velocity, wherewith
DF would be uniformly de&s;cribed, to that, where|with
BE is uniformly de&s;cribed, the ultimate ratio
of DF to BE is al&s;o the ultimate ratio of the fir&s;t
of the&s;e velocities to the la&s;t; becau&s;e all the ulti|mate
ratios of the &s;ame varying ratio are the &s;ame
with each other. Therefore the ratio of the velo|city
<PB N="71" REF="74">
at D to the velocity at B, that is, of the fluxi|on
of CD to the fluxion of AB, is the &s;ame with
the ultimate ratio of DF to BE.</P>
<P>IF now the augment BE be denoted by <HI>o,</HI> the
augment DF will be denoted by
<GAP DESC="math">. And here
it is obvious, that all the terms after the fir&s;t taken
together may be made le&s;s than any a&s;&s;ignable part
of the fir&s;t. Con&s;equently the proportion of the
fir&s;t term <GAP DESC="math"> to the whole augment may be
made to approach within any degree whatever of
the proportion of equality; and therefore the ulti|mate
proportion of
<GAP DESC="math"> to <HI>o,</HI> or of DF to
BE, is that of <GAP DESC="math"> only to <HI>o,</HI> or the proportion
of <GAP DESC="math"> to 1.</P>
<P>AND we have already proved, that the proportion
of the velocity at D to the velocity at B is the &s;ame
with the ultimate proportion of DF to BE; there|fore
the velocity at D is to the velocity at B, or the
fluxion of <HI>x</HI>^n to the fluxion of <HI>x,</HI> as <GAP DESC="math"> to 1.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of the treati&s;e of Qua|dratures
the author propo&s;es the relation betwixt
three varying quantities <HI>x, y,</HI> and <HI>z</HI> to be expre&s;&s;ed
by this equation <GAP DESC="math">. Suppo&s;e
the&s;e qnantities to be augmented by any contem|poraneous
<PB N="72" REF="75">
increments great or &s;mall. Let us al&s;o
&s;uppo&s;e &s;ome quantity <HI>o</HI> to be de&s;cribed at the
&s;ame time by &s;ome known velocity, and let that
velocity be denoted by <HI>m</HI>; the velocity, wherewith
the augment of <HI>x</HI> would be uniformly de&s;cribed in
that time be denoted by <HI>x&cmbdot;</HI>; the velocity, wherewith
the augment of <HI>y</HI> would be uniformly de&s;cribed in
the &s;ame time by <HI>y&cmbdot;</HI>; and la&s;tly the velocity, where|with
the augment of <HI>z</HI> would be uniformly de&s;cri|bed
in the &s;ame time by <HI>z&cmbdot;.</HI> Then <GAP DESC="math">, <GAP DESC="math">, and
<GAP DESC="math"> will expre&s;s the contemporaneous increments
of <HI>x, y,</HI> and <HI>z</HI> re&s;pectively. Now when <HI>x</HI> is become <GAP DESC="math">, <HI>y</HI> is become <GAP DESC="math"> and <HI>z</HI> become <GAP DESC="math">;
the former equation will become
<GAP DESC="math">. Here, as the fir&s;t of the&s;e equations exhi|bits
the relation between the three quanties <HI>x, y, z,</HI>
as far as the &s;ame can be expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle equa|tion;
&s;o this &s;econd equation, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the fir&s;t, will expre&s;s the relation between the aug|ments
of the&s;e quantities. But the fir&s;t of the&s;e equa|tions
may be taken out of the latter; whence will
ari&s;e this third equation <GAP DESC="math">
<PB N="73" REF="76">
<GAP DESC="math">; which al&s;o expre&s;&s;es the
relation between the &s;everal increments; and like|wi&s;e
if <HI>o</HI> be a given quantity, this equation will e|qually
expre&s;s the relation between the velocities,
wherewith the&s;e &s;everal increments are generated
re&s;pectively by a uniform motion. And this equa|tion
being divided by <HI>o</HI> will be reduced to more
&s;imple terms, and yet will equally expre&s;s the rela|tion
of the&s;e velocities; and then the equation will
become <GAP DESC="math">.
Now let us form an equation out of the terms of
this, from which the quantity <HI>o</HI> is ab&s;ent. This e|quation
will be <GAP DESC="math">; and this equation multiplied by <HI>m</HI> becomes
<GAP DESC="math">. It is evident, that
this equation does not expre&s;s the relation of the
forementioned velocities; yet by the diminution of
<HI>o</HI> this equation may come within any degree of
expre&s;&s;ing that relation. Therefore, by what has
been &s;o often inculcated, this equation will expre&s;s
the ultimate relation of the&s;e velocities. But the
fluxions of the quantities <HI>x, y, z</HI> are the ultimate
magnitudes of the&s;e velocities; &s;o that the ultimate
relation of the&s;e velocities is the relation of the
fluxions of the&s;e quantities. Con&s;equently this la&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="77">
equation repre&s;ents the relation of the fluxions of
the quantities <HI>x, y, z.</HI></P>
<P>IT is now pre&s;umed, we have removed all dif|ficulty
from the demon&s;trations, which Sir I&s;aac
Newton has him&s;elf given, of his rules for finding
fluxions.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e we have en|deavoured
at &s;uch a de&s;cription of fluxions, as might
not fail of giving a di&s;tinct and clear conception of
them. We then confirmed the fundamental rules
for comparing fluxions together by demon&s;trations
of the mo&s;t formal and unexceptionable kind. And
now having ju&s;tified Sir I&s;aac Newton's own de|mon&s;trations,
we have not only &s;hewn, that his
doctrine of fluxions is an unerring guide in the &s;o|lution
of geometrical problems, but al&s;o that he
him&s;elf had fully proved the certainty of this me|thod.
For accompli&s;hing this la&s;t part of our un|dertaking
it was nece&s;&s;ary to explain at large ano|ther
method of rea&s;oning e&s;tabli&s;hed by him, no
le&s;s worthy con&s;ideration; &s;ince as the fir&s;t inabled
him to inve&s;tigate the geometrical problems, where|by
he was conducted in tho&s;e remote &s;earches into
nature, which have been the &s;ubject of univer&s;al
admiration, &s;o to the latter method is owing the
&s;urprizing brevity, wherewith he has demon&s;trated
tho&s;e di&s;coveries.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THUS we have at length fini&s;hed the
whole of our de&s;ign, and &s;hall therefore put
a period to this di&s;cour&s;e with the explanation of
the term momentum frequently u&s;ed by Sir I&s;aac
Newton, though we have yet had no occa&s;ion to
mention it.</P>
<P>AND in this I &s;hall be the more particular, be|cau&s;e
Sir I&s;aac Newton's definition of momenta,
That they are the momentaneous increments or de|crements
of varying quantities, may po&s;&s;ibly be
thought ob&s;cure. Therefore I &s;hall give a fuller
delineation of them, and &s;uch a one, as &s;hall agree
to the general &s;en&s;e of his de&s;cription, and never
fail to make the u&s;e of this term, in every propo|&s;ition,
where it occurs, clearly to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IN determining the ultimate ratios between the
contemporaneous differences of quantities, it is often
previou&s;ly required to con&s;ider each of the&s;e differ|ences
apart, in order to di&s;cover, how much of
tho&s;e differences is nece&s;&s;ary for expre&s;&s;ing that
ultimate ratio. In this ca&s;e Sir I&s;aac Newton di|&s;tingui&s;hes,
by the name of momentum, &s;o much
<PB N="76" REF="79">
of any difference, as con&s;titutes the term u&s;ed in ex|pre&s;&s;ing
this ultimate ratio.</P>
<P>THUS in page 71, where BE is &equals; <HI>o,</HI> and DF
equal to <GAP DESC="math"> the ultimate ratio of DF to BE be|ing
the ratio of

<GAP DESC="math"> to <HI>o,</HI> &s;uch a part only
of DF as is de|noted
by <GAP DESC="math">,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>without the addition of any of the following terms
of the &s;eries, con&s;titutes the whole of the momen|tum
of the line CD; but the momentum of AB
is the &s;ame as the whole difference BE, or <HI>o.</HI></P>
<P>IN like manner, if A and B denote varying
quantities, and their contemporaneous increments
be repre&s;ented by <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>; the rectangle under any
given line M and <HI>a</HI> is the contemporaneous in|crement
of the rectangle under M and A, and
A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>b</HI> is the like increment of the
rectangle under A, B. And here the whole incre|ment
M &times; <HI>a</HI> repre&s;ents the momentum of the re|ctangle
under M, A; but A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> only, and
not the whole increment A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>b,</HI> is
called the momentum of the rectangle under A, B;
becau&s;e &s;o much only of this latter increment is re|quired
for determining the ultimate ratio of the
increment of M &times; A to the increment of A &times; B, this
ratio being the &s;ame with the ultimate ratio of
M &times; <HI>a</HI> to A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI>; for the ultimate ratio of
A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> to A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>b</HI> is the ratio
<PB N="77" REF="80">
of equality. Con&s;equently the ultimate ratio of
M &times; <HI>a</HI> to A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> differs not from the ulti|mate
ratio of M &times; <HI>a</HI> to A &times; <HI>b</HI> &plus; B &times; <HI>a</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI> &times; <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>THESE momenta equally relate to the de|crements
of quantities, as to their increments,
and the ultimate ratio of increments, and of de|crements
at the &s;ame place is the &s;ame; therefore
the momentum of any quantity may be determined,
either by con&s;idering the increment, or the decre|ment
of that quantity, or even by con&s;idering both
together. And in determining the momentum of
the rectangle under A and B&punc; Sir I&s;aac Newton has
taken the la&s;t of the&s;e methods; becau&s;e by this
means the &s;uperfluous rectangle is &s;ooner di&s;enga|ged
from the demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>HERE it mu&s;t always be remembred, that the
only u&s;e, which ought ever to be made of the&s;e
momenta, is to compare them one with another,
and for no other purpo&s;e than to determine the
ultimate or prime proportion between the &s;everal
increments or decrements, from whence they are
deduced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neque &s;pect.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters"> magnitudo momentorum, &s;ed prima na&s;cen|tium
proportio. Newt. Princ. Phil. Lib. II. Lem. 2.</NOTE>. Herein the method of prime and ulti|mate
ratios e&s;&s;entially differs from that of indivi&s;i|bles;
for in that method the&s;e momenta are con&s;i|dered
ab&s;olutely as parts, whereof their re&s;pective
quantities are actually compo&s;ed. But though the&s;e
momenta have no final magnitude, which would
be nece&s;&s;ary to make them parts capable of com|pounding

<PB N="78" REF="81">
a whole by accumulation; yet their ulti|mate
ratios are as truly a&s;&s;ignable as the ratios be|tween
any quantities whatever. Therefore none
of the objections made again&s;t the doctrine of indi|vi&s;ibles
are of the lea&s;t weight again&s;t this method:
but while we attend carefully to the ob&s;ervation
here laid down, we &s;hall be as &s;ecure again&s;t error,
and the mind will receive as full &s;atisfaction, as in
any the mo&s;t unexceptionable demon&s;tration of Eu|clide.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall make no apology for the length of
this di&s;cour&s;e: for as we can &s;carce &s;u&s;pect, after
what has been above written, that our readers will
be at any lo&s;s to remove of them&s;elves, whatever
little difficulties may have ari&s;en in this &s;ubject from
the brevity of Sir I&s;aac Newton's expre&s;&s;ions; &s;o
our time cannot be thought mi&s;employed, if we
&s;hall at all have contributed, by a more diffu&s;ive
phra&s;e, to the ea&s;ier under&s;tanding the&s;e exten|&s;ive,
and celebrated inventions.</P>
