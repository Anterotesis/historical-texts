<HEAD>To the <HI>AUTHOR</HI> of the <HI>ENQUIRY</HI>
into the Cau&s;es of the Decay of the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will probably be &s;urpriz'd at this
Addre&s;s on occa&s;ion of your Enquiry,
&s;o many months after the publication
of it. But my di&s;tance from the town,
and engagement in bu&s;ine&s;s, hinder'd
me from an early &s;ight of it; and many accidents,
which 'tis of no importance to mention, oblig'd
me to delay fini&s;hing the&s;e papers, &s;o &s;oon as I in|tended,
when I began to write them. On the
whole, as I am not attempting to critici&s;e on your
performance, but only to offer &s;ome remarks,
which I hope may be of common u&s;e, if what I
&s;ay be ju&s;t and important, it cannot be quite too
late; and if it be either fal&s;e or trifling, it ap|pears
after all too &s;oon.</P>
<P>As I am per&s;uaded that the Di&s;&s;enting Cau&s;e is
founded on rea&s;on and truth, and that the honour
of God, and the publick good is nearly concern'd
in its &s;upport, you have my hearty thanks for that
generous zeal with which you have appear'd for
the defence of it. On this account, I &s;hould think
my&s;elf highly oblig'd to treat you with decency
and re&s;pect, how much &s;oever my &s;entiments might
differ from yours, as to the particular cau&s;es of
its decay. And indeed, Sir, you have taken the
<PB N="4" REF="4">
mo&s;t effectual method in the world to prevent any
thing of a rude attack, by treating all whom you
mention, even the meane&s;t and the weake&s;t, with
remarkable candour and humanity.</P>
<P>But I have the happine&s;s of agreeing with you
in far the greater part of what you advance. I
will not now debate, whether the principles of our
Di&s;&s;ent are le&s;s known than they formerly were;
and con&s;equently whether that be, properly &s;peak|ing,
a cau&s;e of the late decay of our intere&s;t: but
I will readily grant, Sir, that it is highly nece&s;&s;ary
they &s;hould be known; and I think you have done
us a great deal of &s;ervice by &s;etting them in &s;o
ea&s;y, and yet in &s;o &s;trong a light. I hope it may
be a means of informing and e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome,
who are too bu&s;y or too indolent to give them&s;elves
the trouble of peru&s;ing what Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI>
and &s;ome others have written &s;o copiou&s;ly and &s;o
judiciou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I farther apprehend, Sir, that nothing can be
&s;aid upon the ca&s;e before us of more certain truth
or more &s;olid importance, than what you have
frequently ob&s;erv'd; <HI>viz.</HI> that our intere&s;t has re|ceiv'd
great damage from our acting in a manner
directly oppo&s;ite to our principles, by un&s;criptural
impo&s;itions, and uncharitable contentions with each
other. I hope many of us have &s;een our mi&s;takes
here, and &s;hall be careful for the future, to avoid
what has been attended with &s;o many unhappy
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>After having thus declar'd my agreement with
you, in the greater part of your di&s;cour&s;e, I hope,
Sir, you will pardon me, if I add, that I cannot
think that you have exhau&s;ted your &s;ubject. To
&s;peak freely, I think you have omitted &s;ome cau&s;es
of the decay of our intere&s;t, which are at lea&s;t
as important as tho&s;e you have handled. It
is the de&s;ign of my pre&s;ent undertaking, to point
<PB N="5" REF="5">
out &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them, which
have occur'd to my thoughts: And I per&s;uade my|&s;elf,
Sir, you will be no more offended with me, for
offering this &s;upplement to your Enquiry, than I
imagine I &s;hould my&s;elf be with any third per&s;on,
who &s;hould fix upon others which may have e&s;caped
us both.</P>
<P>You will the more readily excu&s;e the freedom
which I take, as I imagine that the Scenes of our
Lives have been widely different<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the Author to whom I write is not certainly known, I take it for granted he is what he &s;eems by his manner of writing, a Gentleman of the Laity: And tho' I have been told &s;ince I drew up this letter, he is &s;uppos'd by many to be a young mini&s;ter in town, I have no evidence of it which is convincing to me: And as I apprehend, it would be ill manners to appear to know him under &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e, I thought it not proper to alter what I had writ with regard to the late report.</NOTE>, and con&s;equent|ly
I may have had an opportunity of making &s;ome
u&s;eful ob&s;ervations which have not fallen in your
way: Tho' I que&s;tion not but if you, Sir, had been
in my circum&s;tances, you would &s;oon have re|mark'd
them; and perhaps have communicated
them to the publick with much greater advantage.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add nothing more by way of introduction,
but that I chu&s;e the title I have prefix'd to the&s;e
papers, rather than that of <HI>a farther Enquiry into
the cau&s;es of the decay of the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t</HI>; part|ly,
Sir, as it &s;eem'd mo&s;t re&s;pectful to you, but
principally that I may not appear to advance any
direct charge again&s;t any of my brethren in the
proce&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e. I am &s;en&s;ible that would
be highly indecent on many accounts, and parti|cularly
as it is from the example of &s;everal among&s;t
them whom I have mo&s;t intimately known, that I
have learnt many of tho&s;e particulars of conduct,
which I am now going to offer to your con&s;idera|tion,
as the happie&s;t expedients for the revival of
our common cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
But before I proceed to particulars, I would ob|&s;erve
(what we immediately allow, but too quick|ly
forget) that we are to be concern'd for this in|tere&s;t,
not merely as the cau&s;e of a di&s;tinct party,
but of truth, honour, and liberty; and I will add,
in a great mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e of &s;erious piety too.
I would be far from confining all true religion to
the members of our own congregations. I am very
well aware that there are a multitude of excellent
per&s;ons in the e&s;tabli&s;hment, both among&s;t the cler|gy
and the laity, who are (in their different &s;ta|tions)
burning and &s;hining lights; &s;uch as reflect a
glory on the Human Nature, and the Chri&s;tian
Profe&s;&s;ion. Yet I apprehend &s;ome of the&s;e are the
per&s;ons who will mo&s;t readily allow, that, in pro|portion
to the numbers, there is generally more
practical religion to be found in our a&s;&s;emblies,
than in theirs. This was &s;urely the original, and
this, if I mi&s;take not, mu&s;t be the &s;upport of our
cau&s;e. It was not merely a generous &s;en&s;e of li|berty,
(which may warm the brea&s;t of a dei&s;t or
an athei&s;t) but a religious reverence for the divine
authority, which animated our pious forefathers,
to &s;o re&s;olute and &s;o expen&s;ive an oppo&s;ition to the
attempts which were made in their day, to invade
the rights of con&s;cience, and the throne of God
its only &s;overeign. And if the cau&s;e be not &s;till
maintain'd on the &s;ame principles, I think it will
hardly be worth our while to be much concern'd
about maintaining it at all. It mu&s;t argue a great
defect, or partiality of thought, for any with the
<HI>Jews</HI> of old to boa&s;t of their being free from hu|man
impo&s;itions, when they are <HI>the &s;ervants of &s;in</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 33, 34.</NOTE>.
And all the world will evidently perceive, that it
is the temper of a Phari&s;ee, rather than of a Chri|&s;tian,
to contend about <HI>mint, ani&s;e</HI> and <HI>cummin,</HI>
(on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion or the other) while
<PB N="7" REF="7">
there is an apparent indifference about <HI>the weightier
matters of the law</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 23.</NOTE>. We that are mini&s;ters may
entertain our&s;elves and our hearers with fine ha|rangues
in defence of liberty; but I apprehend
that in the near views of death and eternity, we
&s;hall have little &s;atisfaction in reflecting on the
converts we have made to that, unle&s;s at the &s;ame
time we have &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that they are
per&s;ons of true &s;ub&s;tantial piety; &s;uch as will be
our crown in the day of the Lord, and our com|panions
in the glories of the heavenly world. I
cannot &s;ay how trifling and contemptible our la|bours
appear to me, when con&s;ider'd in any other
view. And therefore, Sir, it will be my concern
throughout this whole di&s;cour&s;e, to point out tho&s;e
methods for the &s;upport of the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t,
which I imagine will be mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to the
cau&s;e of practical religion, and vital holine&s;s in all
its branches.</P>
<P>It was the ob&s;ervation of Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> almo&s;t for|ty
years ago, in his incomparable di&s;cour&s;e on the
Pa&s;toral Care<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. viii. p. 204.</NOTE>, "That the Di&s;&s;enters had then in
a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t that good character for
&s;trictne&s;s in religion, which had gain'd them
their credit, and made &s;uch numbers fall off to
them." Whether that good character has &s;ince
been recover'd, or has not been more and more
declining, &s;ome others are more capable of judg|ing;
but I think it calls for our &s;erious reflection.
And if we find upon enquiry, that this our glory
is departing, it &s;urely de&s;erves to be mention'd, as
one cau&s;e, at lea&s;t, of the decay of our intere&s;t:
And that all who &s;incerely wi&s;h well to it, &s;hould
expre&s;s their affection, by exerting them&s;elves with
the utmo&s;t zeal, for the revival of practical religion
among&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
This mu&s;t be our common care, according to
the various &s;tations in which Providence has placed
us: And as for mini&s;ters, nothing can be more evi|dent,
than that they, by virtue of their office, are
under peculiar obligations to it. And in order to
pur&s;ue it with the greater advantage, I cannot but
think that it &s;hould be their concern, TO STUDY
THE CHARACTER AND TEMPER OF THEIR PEOPLE;
that, &s;o far as they can do it with con&s;cience and
honour, they may render them&s;elves agreeable to
them, both in their publick mini&s;trations, and their
private conver&s;e.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is &s;o obvious a thought, that one would
imagine it could not be overlook'd or di&s;puted;
yet it is certain our intere&s;t has receiv'd con&s;ide|rable
damage for want of a becoming regard to it,
e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who have been &s;etting out in the
mini&s;try among&s;t us. It was therefore, Sir, with
great &s;urprize, that I found you had intirely omit|ted
it in your late Enquiry, and had dropt &s;ome
hints, which (tho' to be &s;ure you did not intend it)
may very probably lead young preachers into a dif|ferent
and contrary way of thinking, than which
hardly any thing can be more prejudicial, either
to them, or to the cau&s;e in which they are imbark'd.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of yours, to which I principally re|fer,
is in the 33^d and 34^t^h pages of your <HI>Enquiry</HI>:
where, among&s;t other things, you ob&s;erve, that "a
great many of tho&s;e things that plea&s;e the people,
have often a very bad tendency in general." And
you add, "the being pleas'd, which they &s;o
much in&s;i&s;t upon, &s;eldom ari&s;es from any thing
but &s;ome oddne&s;s that hits their peculiar hu|mour,
and is not from any view to edification at
all, and therefore too mean to be worthy any
one's &s;tudy. The people do not u&s;ually know
wherein oratory, &s;trength of &s;peech, the art of
per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> con&s;i&s;t; and therefore it is vanity
<PB N="9" REF="9">
&s;hip; <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. l. 11.</NOTE><HI>they only compa&s;s them&s;elves about with &s;parks of
their own kindling, and &s;hall at la&s;t lie down in &s;orrow.</HI>
And if we be &s;incere Chri&s;tians, &s;uperficial &s;ervices
will rob us of that noble plea&s;ure which would attend
a more lively di&s;charge of our duty, and give us a
great deal of perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s in the review;
&s;o that if we are concerned either for our own &s;afety,
or comfort, it &s;hould be our care, that the vigour of
religion be kept up in our hearts.</P>
<P>I would further recommend this, as what is of the
utmo&s;t importance to our publick u&s;efulne&s;s. It is
probable that our people will imbibe the temper and
&s;pirit which appears in us. This is &s;o obvious a re|mark,
that it is become a proverb; <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. iv. 9.</NOTE><HI>like people, like
prie&s;t.</HI> If we are &s;tupid and unaffected, it will abate
the energy of our addre&s;&s;es, and at once be the cau&s;e
and the excu&s;e, of the like languor and in&s;en&s;ibility
in them. But if our heart be filled with vital reli|gion,
it will have a happy influence on all our mini|&s;trations.
Our prayers and our &s;ermons will be tinc|tured
with it. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 34.</NOTE><HI>Out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> When grace is in exerci&s;e within, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P&s;al xlv. 2.</NOTE><HI>it
will be poured into our lips,</HI> and <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Luke iv. 22.</NOTE><HI>many gracious words

wor&s;hippers, in pre&s;enting &s;ea&s;onable and proper pe|titions
to GOD, and the divine warmth and fervency
of our own &s;ouls, will be a means to kindle the like
holy fire in theirs: And when we are <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 27.</NOTE><HI>declaring the
coun&s;el of God</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 2.</NOTE>, <HI>our doctrine will drop as the rain, our
&s;peech will di&s;til as the dew, as the &s;mall rain on the ten|der
herb, and as the &s;howers upon the gra&s;s</HI>: The con|&s;olations
de&s;igned for tho&s;e <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 18.</NOTE><HI>who have fled for refuge
to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before them,</HI> will gently in|&s;inuate
them&s;elves into their minds, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 13.</NOTE><HI>and fill them</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HI>with joy and peace in believing.</HI> And if we partake
of that <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John iii. 34.</NOTE><HI>Spirit</HI> which <HI>God gave without mea&s;ure to</HI> his
Son, <HI>whom he &s;ent to &s;peak his words,</HI> we &s;hall then
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 29.</NOTE><HI>teach with authority</HI>; our in&s;tructions will be deli|vered
with an elevation &s;uitable to our character, and
our people will not only hear, but they will al&s;o feel
the weight of our admonitions.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in the performances of &s;ome
mini&s;ters, which &s;trangely impre&s;&s;es their pious hear|ers.
Though their di&s;cour&s;es be de&s;titute of the or|naments
of language, yet they <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John i. 13.</NOTE><HI>who are born of God</HI>
find a &s;weetne&s;s in them, which is incomparably be|yond
that which ari&s;eth from elegant phra&s;es, and
harmonious periods. That which appears low and
flat to the ta&s;te of many, affords the experienced
Chri&s;tian &s;uch an inward and &s;ublime plea&s;ure, as is
not to be found in the highe&s;t &s;trains of the mo&s;t pom|pous
eloquence. Happy <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE><HI>the men of God,</HI> who have
this divine unction which &s;o powerfully attracts de|vout
&s;ouls, who&s;e reli&s;h is formed by conver&s;ing with
heaven. They are like <HI>Aaron</HI> the high-prie&s;t, when
he was con&s;ecrated to his office; the holy oil which
was <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cxxxiii. 2.</NOTE><HI>poured on his head,</HI> in &s;o abundant a quantity, <HI>that
it flowed down to the &s;kirts of his garments,</HI> was grateful
to all who were about him: So when the&s;e anointed
ones come forth to mini&s;ter, a &s;weet perfume, and a
divine fragrancy diffu&s;eth it&s;elf through the whole a&s;|&s;embly,
and is delightfully perceived, by all tho&s;e who
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 14.</NOTE><HI>have their &s;en&s;es &s;piritually exerci&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The advanced piety of our fathers in the mini&s;try,
did eminently conduce to their remarkable &s;ucce&s;s.
The <HI>Memoirs</HI> which we have of the lives of &s;everal
of them, manife&s;t their great attainments in vital and
inward religion; and I fear we &s;hall never recover the
dying intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity, 'till that be found in
us, which render'd them &s;o &s;ignally u&s;eful in their ge|neration.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">
I have heard it ob&s;erved by &s;ome, who are in a way
of thinking different from us, that our publick ad|mini&s;trations
are managed with greater propriety and
exactne&s;s, than they were in the days of our prede|ce&s;&s;ors.
And without &s;u&s;picion of flattery, I can
congratulate the ri&s;ing generation of mini&s;ters among
us, with the great improvements they have made, in
the method and &s;tyle of their performances. But if
the form and order of them is better, I am afraid
the temper of our minds is wor&s;e; and &s;ince the mi|ni&s;ters
of the la&s;t age did &s;o much good with their
unpoli&s;hed addre&s;&s;es, and we &s;o little with our neater
compo&s;ures, one would think this might fully con|vince
us, that <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mat xvi. 23.</NOTE><HI>a &s;avour of the things that be of God</HI>
is of much greater importance to a mini&s;ter of the
Go&s;pel, than that politene&s;s which is now &s;o much
admired and affected. It is happy, indeed, when both
the&s;e meet in the &s;ame per&s;on, but in&s;tances of this
are very rare. Every pious preacher cannot deliver
him&s;elf with elegance and exactne&s;s; and accurate
method and beautiful language, are not always ani|mated
and &s;upported by real devotion. We &s;hould
therefore divide our work, and prepare our hearts as
well as lips for the &s;ervices of the &s;anctuary, and en|deavour
after &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of &s;pirit, which will more
effectually recommend our labours to enlighten'd
minds, than <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 4.</NOTE><HI>excellency of &s;peech, or the enticing words
of man's wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>II. We &s;hould not only <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE><HI>take heed unto our&s;elves,</HI> but
al&s;o <HI>to our doctrine,</HI> that our preaching may have the
mo&s;t direct tendency to do good.</P>
<P>Upon this head I cannot but advi&s;e, that &s;ublime
&s;peculations and ab&s;tru&s;e controver&s;ies, &s;hould not or|dinarily
be introduced into our &s;ermons. The&s;e <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ib. i. 4.</NOTE><HI>mi|ni&s;ter
que&s;tions rather than godly edifying.</HI> Chri&s;tianity
<PB N="12" REF="12">
is a <HI>doctrine according to godline&s;s, and not a &s;trife about
words.</HI> It is an ea&s;y matter to engage our warmer
hearers in di&s;putes on &s;ubjects, which neither they, nor
we can fully under&s;tand; and the mo&s;t unfit for &s;uch
work, are generally the mo&s;t forward to enter into it.
I allow, it is the ready way to procure the regards of
tho&s;e, who lay a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon their own opini|ons,
but their e&s;teem will be purcha&s;ed at too dear a
rate, &s;ince in&s;tead of promoting true religion, it will
mo&s;t certainly de&s;troy it. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word"> Jam. iii. 16.</NOTE><HI>Where this zeal and con|tention
is, there is confu&s;ion, and every evil work.</HI> Some
may po&s;&s;ibly admire it for its &s;hining lu&s;tre, but too
fatal experience proves it to be a raging flame and a
devouring fire, and wherever it breaks out, there is
rea&s;on to fear, that practical godline&s;s will &s;oon be
con&s;umed. The thoughts and the di&s;cour&s;es of
Chri&s;tians, will be &s;o entirely &s;wallowed up by the
matters in debate, that things of the greate&s;t moment
will be di&s;regarded by them; and their tempers will
be &s;o embitter'd again&s;t each other, that charity it|&s;elf,
the <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 13.</NOTE><HI>greate&s;t</HI> of all graces, will perhaps be counted
a crime.</P>
<P>We live in an age, in which all advantages will be
taken again&s;t Chri&s;tianity: And our pulpit &s;kirmi&s;hes
have made &s;port for unbelievers, and furni&s;hed them
with matter for banter and ridicule. By the&s;e we have
given them occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. ix. 7.</NOTE><HI>the prophet is a fool, the

if tho&s;e in&s;tances of our weakne&s;s and folly were bu|ried

his exaltation to the right-hand of GOD, and
his glorious appearance to the univer&s;al judgment.
The&s;e arguments &s;hould be frequently and largely

&s;cribes in&s;tructed unto the kingdom of heaven, bringing

<P>Nor would I have the writings of other wi&s;e and
good men entirely laid a&s;ide; I could rather wi&s;h,
that the u&s;e of &s;ome of them, which are much neg|lected,
might be revived. I particularly refer to the
works of &s;ome of the <HI>old Puritans,</HI> and of the Divines
of the la&s;t age. I own my&s;elf an admirer of them,
and have often thought it a great mercy, that there
are &s;o many of them in the hands of the common peo|ple,
to &s;upply what is deficient in our more fa&s;hiona|ble
in&s;tructions. I allow that the &s;tyle of tho&s;e ex|cellent
men is &s;ometimes heavy, their diction low,
and their method not the mo&s;t ea&s;y or ju&s;t; but their
thoughts are weighty, their matter &s;ub&s;tantial, and
their di&s;cour&s;es &s;piritual and affecting. I once a&s;ked
a very <HI>popular preacher,</HI> (who filled a con&s;iderable
po&s;t among&s;t us, with great reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s)
<PB N="17" REF="17">
a thou&s;and arguments concurring to in&s;pire us
with a &s;ort of paternal tenderne&s;s for the &s;ouls of
the meane&s;t of our people. This will teach us
to bear with their prejudices, to accommodate
our&s;elves to their weakne&s;s; and to con&s;ider it as
a mixture of impiety and cruelty, to neglect num|bers
of them, out of complai&s;ance to the ta&s;te of
a few, who are perhaps &s;ome of them but occa|&s;ional
vi&s;itants, and whom we judge by their ha|bits,
rather than by any per&s;onal acquaintance, to
be a part of the polite world.</P>
<P>Did I affect to throw together all that might be
&s;aid on this &s;ubject, I might both illu&s;trate and
confirm what I have already written, by &s;hewing
at large, that Chri&s;tianity is a religion originally
calculated for the plainer part of mankind, by that
God who <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 27.</NOTE><HI>has cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world
to confound the wi&s;e, and the weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty</HI>; and con&s;e|quently
that a neglect and contempt of the com|mon
people, is far from being the &s;pirit of the
go&s;pel. I might add many remarks to this pur|po&s;e
on the preaching and conduct of St. <HI>Paul,</HI>
and fill whole pages with quotations from him and
the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, and many more from
&s;ome of the mo&s;t ancient and celebrated Fathers
of the Church. But I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary
for the &s;upport of my argument, and I am per|&s;uaded
that you, Sir, in particular, have no need
of being taught the&s;e things from me.</P>
<P>Permit me only to add, (what you mu&s;t fre|quently
have ob&s;erv'd) that our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>
is a mo&s;t amiable and wonderful example of a
plain, familiar, and popular preacher. When we
come to peru&s;e tho&s;e divine di&s;cour&s;es, which ex|torted
a confe&s;&s;ion from his very enemies that he
<PB N="18" REF="18">
&s;pake as never man &s;pake, we find neither a long
train of ab&s;tract rea&s;onings, nor a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
labour'd periods, adorn'd with an artificial exact|ne&s;s;
but the mo&s;t &s;olid and important &s;en&s;e, de|liver'd
in an ea&s;y and natural way, illu&s;trated
by &s;imilies taken from the mo&s;t common objects
in life, and enforced with lively figures, and the
&s;tronge&s;t energy of expre&s;&s;ion; which is well con|&s;i&s;tent
with all the former. So that upon the
whole it was mo&s;t happily calculated, at once to
in&s;truct the mo&s;t ignorant, and to awaken the
mo&s;t negligent hearer. I cannot but wi&s;h that
&s;ome judicious writer would attempt to &s;et this
part of our Lord's character in a clearer and a
more particular light; and would &s;hew us how
the whole of his conduct, as well as the manner
of his addre&s;s, was calculated to promote his u&s;e|fulne&s;s
under the character of a preacher of
righteou&s;ne&s;s. I hope &s;uch an e&s;&s;ay might be very
&s;erviceable to tho&s;e of us, who have the honour
to &s;ucceed him in that part of his work; and I
per&s;uade my&s;elf that it would furni&s;h us with a
variety of beautiful remarks on many pa&s;&s;ages in
the evangelical hi&s;torians, which are not to be
found in the mo&s;t celebrated commentators.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me, Sir, for having in&s;i&s;ted &s;o
largely on the nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to render
our&s;elves agreeable to our people; becau&s;e I am
fully per&s;uaded, that it is of great importance to
the &s;upport and revival of the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t.
I hope you already apprehend that I intend no|thing
in this advice, which is below the pur&s;uit of
the mo&s;t elevated genius, or the mo&s;t generous
temper; nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the politene&s;s
of the gentleman and the &s;cholar, or the dignity
of the chri&s;tian and the mini&s;ter. You cannot
imagine that I would recommend a popularity
<PB N="19" REF="19">
rais'd by quirks and jingles, or &s;ounded on af|fected
tones, or ridiculous grimaces; and much le&s;s
on an attempt to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind
about trifling controver&s;ies, and the peculiar un|&s;criptural
phra&s;es of a party. Such a popularity
as this, is almo&s;t the only thing that is more de|&s;picable,
than the in&s;olent pride of de&s;pi&s;ing the
people.</P>
<P>If any of my younger brethren were to en|quire
how another popularity, of a far more ho|nourable
kind, is to be pur&s;ued and &s;ecured, I
an&s;wer, that their own conver&s;e and ob&s;ervation
on the world, mu&s;t furni&s;h them with the mo&s;t
valuable in&s;tructions on this head. And tho' &s;ome
of their particular remarks may differ, according
to the various places and circum&s;tances in which
they are made; yet I apprehend there are many
things of con&s;iderable importance, in which they
will all agree. As for in&s;tance:</P>
<P>They will quickly &s;ee that the generality of
the Di&s;&s;enters, who appear to be per&s;ons of &s;e|rious
piety, have been deeply impre&s;s'd with the
peculiarities of the go&s;pel-&s;cheme. They have
felt the divine energy of tho&s;e important doctrines,
to awaken, and revive, and enlarge the &s;oul; and
therefore they will have a peculiar reli&s;h for di&s;|cour&s;es
upon them. So that if a man &s;hould ge|nerally
confine him&s;elf to &s;ubjects of natural re|ligion,
and moral virtue, and &s;eldom fix on the doc|trines
of Chri&s;t, and the &s;pirit, and then perhaps
treat them with &s;uch caution, that he might &s;eem
rather to be making conce&s;&s;ions to an adver&s;ary,
than giving vent to the fulne&s;s of his heart on its
darling &s;ubject, he would &s;oon find, that all the
penetration and eloquence of an angel, could not
make him univer&s;ally agreeable to our a&s;&s;em|blies.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="20">
Many of our people have pa&s;s'd thro' a variety
of exerci&s;es in their minds, relating to the great
concern of eternal &s;alvation. And they apprehend
that the &s;cripture teaches us to a&s;cribe this com|bat
to the agency of &s;atan, and the corruptions of
our own heart on the one hand, and the opera|tions
of the holy &s;pirit of God on the other. It
is therefore very agreeable to them, to hear the&s;e
experimental &s;ubjects handled with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
and tenderne&s;s. It rai&s;es their veneration for
&s;uch a mini&s;ter, as for one who has him&s;elf ta&s;ted
of the grace of God, and encourages their con|fidence
in him, and their expectations of impro|ving
by his labours. On the other hand, it
grieves them when the&s;e &s;ubjects are much ne|glected,
and gives them the mo&s;t formidable &s;u&s;|picions
if one word be dropt which &s;eems to pour
contempt upon them, as if they were all fancy
and enthu&s;ia&s;m; (with which, it mu&s;t be granted,
they are &s;ometimes mix'd.)</P>
<P>The greater part of mo&s;t di&s;&s;enting congrega|tions
con&s;i&s;ting (as we before ob&s;erv'd) of plain
people, who have not enjoy'd the advantages of a
learned education, nor had lei&s;ure for improve|ments
by after-&s;tudy, it is apparently nece&s;&s;ary
that a man &s;hould &s;peak <HI>plainly</HI> to them, if he de|&s;ire
they &s;hould under&s;tand and approve what he
&s;ays. And as for tho&s;e that are truly religious,
they attend on publick wor&s;hip, not that they
may be amu&s;ed with a form or a &s;ound, nor en|tertain'd
with &s;ome new and curious &s;peculation;
but that their hearts may be enlarged as in the
pre&s;ence of God, that they may be powerfully
affected with tho&s;e great things of religion, which
they already know and believe, that &s;o their con|duct
may be &s;uitably influenced by them. And
to this purpo&s;e they de&s;ire that their mini&s;ters
<PB N="21" REF="21">
may &s;peak as if they were in earne&s;t, in a <HI>lively</HI>
and <HI>pathetick,</HI> as well as a clear and intelligible
manner.</P>
<P>Such is the ta&s;te of the generality of the di&s;|&s;enters;
a ta&s;te which I apprehend they will &s;till
retain, whatever attempts may be made to alter
it. And I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that I
conceive this turn of thought in the people to be
the great &s;upport of our intere&s;t, and not the
little &s;cruples which you hint at in the 34^t^h page of
your Letter, nor even tho&s;e rational and generous
principles of liberty, which you &s;o clearly pro|po&s;e,
and &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert. And I cannot
but believe, that if the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, and
the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters in general, were mutual|ly
to exchange their &s;train of preaching, and their
manner of living but for one year, it would be
the ruin of our cau&s;e, even though there &s;hould
be no alteration in the con&s;titution and di&s;cipline
of the church of <HI>England.</HI> However you might
fare at <HI>London,</HI> or in &s;ome very &s;ingular ca&s;es
el&s;ewhere, I can hardly imagine that there
would be di&s;&s;enters enough left in &s;ome con&s;i|derable
counties, to fill one of our large&s;t meet|ing-places.</P>
<P>We have then advanced thus far; that he who
would be generally agreeable to di&s;&s;enters, mu&s;t
be an evangelical, an experimental, a plain and
an affectionate preacher. Now I mu&s;t do our
common people the ju&s;tice to own, that when
the&s;e points are &s;ecured, they are not very
delicate in their demands, with regard to the
forms of a di&s;cour&s;e. They will not in &s;uch a
ca&s;e be very much di&s;gu&s;ted, though there be no
regular charm of rea&s;oning, no remarkable pro|priety
of thought or of expre&s;&s;ion, no elegance
of language, and but little decency of addre&s;s.
<PB N="22" REF="22">
The want of all the&s;e is forgiven, to what they
apprehend of much greater importance. Yet, Sir,
I would not from hence in&s;er, that the&s;e things
are to be neglected; on the contrary, I appre|hend
it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould
be diligently attended to, in order to obtain that
univer&s;al popularity, which I think &s;o de&s;irable
for the &s;ake of more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. A
man of a good ta&s;te will certainly take &s;ome care
about them. 'Tis what he owes to him&s;elf, and
to the politer part of his audience, whom he
will never be willing to lo&s;e in the crowd: And
he need not fear that a prudent regard to them,
will &s;poil his acceptance with the people. Few
of them like a di&s;cour&s;e the wor&s;e for being
thoroughly good; and the accompli&s;hed orator
will find, perhaps to his &s;urprize, that they will
not only know and feel the important truths of
religion, in the mo&s;t agreeable dre&s;s he can give
them, but that they will even applaud the order
and regularity of his compo&s;ures, the beauty of his
language, and the gracefulne&s;s of his delivery,
at the &s;ame time that they have the candour
not to complain of the indige&s;ted rovings, the
unnatural tran&s;ports, and the awkward di&s;tor|tions
of the pious well-meaning, but injudicious
preacher. For human nature is &s;o formed, that
&s;ome manners of thinking and &s;peaking are uni|ver&s;ally
agreeable and delightful. 'Tis the per|fection
of eloquence to be ma&s;ter of the&s;e, and
&s;hould, I think, be the care of every one that
&s;peaks in publick, to pur&s;ue them as far as ge|nius
and opportunity will allow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is that regard to the <HI>SENSUS COMMUNIS,</HI> which <HI>Tully</HI> thinks &s;o nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE>.</P>

The man who forms him&s;elf upon &s;uch views
as the&s;e, if he be not remarkably deficient in
natural capacities, will probably be popular a|mong&s;t
the di&s;&s;enters <HI>as a Preacher</HI>: But a think|ing
man will ea&s;ily perceive this is not the only
character under which a mini&s;ter is con&s;idered.
His people will naturally and rea&s;onably expect a
<HI>Conduct</HI> an&s;werable to his publick di&s;cour&s;es; and
without it, he cannot be thoroughly agreeable to
them. They will take it for granted, that a
man &s;o well acquainted with divine truths, and
one that &s;eems to be &s;o deeply affected with
them, &s;hould be regular and exemplary in the
whole of his behaviour, and free from the taint
of vice, or of folly, in any remarkable degree.
They will expect that he &s;hould be far from
being a &s;lave to &s;ecular intere&s;t, or to the little
trifles of food, dre&s;s, or dome&s;tick accommoda|tion;
and that he &s;hould avoid every thing
haughty and overbearing, or peevi&s;h and fretful
in his daily conver&s;e. They will conclude, that
a de&s;ire of doing good to &s;ouls, will make him
ea&s;y of acce&s;s to tho&s;e who apply to him for
advice, with regard to their &s;piritual concern|ments;
and that it will likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;e him at
proper times to vi&s;it all the people of his charge,
the poor as well as the rich; and that not only
under the character of a friend, but of a mi|ni&s;ter,
in a direct view to their &s;piritual edifi|cation.

<P>The tenderne&s;s with which parents intere&s;t
them&s;elves in the concerns of their children, and
the earne&s;t de&s;ire that all religious parents mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily have, that theirs may be <HI>a &s;eed to &s;erve
the Lord,</HI> will engage them very kindly to accept
<PB N="24" REF="24">
our care, in attempting to bring them under early
impre&s;&s;ions of &s;erious piety. Catechi&s;ing has there|fore
been generally found a very popular, as well as
a very u&s;eful practice. And here I think it is much
to be wi&s;h'd that our labour may extend to the
youth, as well as to little children; that in a fa|miliar
way they may be methodically acquainted
with the principles of natural religion, and then
with the evidences of the truth of Chri&s;tianity,
and with the nature of it, as it is exhibited in
the New Te&s;tament; both with regard to the
privileges and the duties of chri&s;tians. As this
might be a means of filling our churches with a
con&s;iderable number of rational, catholick, and
pious communicants, from whom con&s;iderable
u&s;efulne&s;s might in time be expected, &s;o it would
greatly oblige their religious parents, and lay a
foundation for a growing friend&s;hip between us,
and our catechumens, in the advance of life.</P>
<P>I once thought to have in&s;i&s;ted more largely on
the&s;e hints, but am happily prevented by the pub|lication
of Mr. <HI>Some's</HI> Sermon, on the methods to
be taken by mini&s;ters for the revival of religion.
He has fully &s;poken my &s;entiments, with regard
to many of tho&s;e articles on which I have only
glanc'd. I per&s;uade my &s;elf, Sir, you will read it
with a great deal of plea&s;ure; for (&s;o far as I
can judge) this &s;ermon is almo&s;t as agreeable an
example of that preaching, as his life is of that
conduct, which he recommends. I am confident
that a man of your good &s;en&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
approve the &s;cheme which I have briefly laid down,
and which is there largely con&s;ider'd and recom|mended.
Were you to chu&s;e a Pa&s;tor for your
&s;elf, I doubt not but you would rejoice in &s;uch
a one; and you would probably have the hearty
concurrence of the weake&s;t and mo&s;t illiterate of
<PB N="25" REF="25">
your pious neighbours. My younger brethren
(for whom alone I am now pre&s;uming to write)
can have no rea&s;on to complain, that I have a&s;|&s;igned
them either a mean, or a &s;evere task. I
heartily de&s;ire to be their companion in all the
mo&s;t laborious, and &s;elf-denying parts of it; and
I per&s;uade my &s;elf, that we &s;hall find it, on the
whole, as delightful as honourable, and as advan|tageous
to our &s;elves, as it will be &s;erviceable to
the publick intere&s;t.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be but one material objection
again&s;t all this; and it is an objection, in which,
I doubt not, but your own thoughts have already
prevented me. It may perhaps be pleaded, that
we have a &s;ort of people among&s;t us, who&s;e appro|bation
and e&s;teem cannot be obtain'd by &s;uch
honourable methods as I propos'd. For they,
whom we call the <HI>rigidly orthodox,</HI> are &s;o devoted
to a peculiar &s;ett of human phra&s;es, which have
been introduc'd into the explication of &s;ome im|portant
doctrines, that they will hardly entertain
a favourable thought of any who &s;cruple the u&s;e
of them, or who do not &s;eem to value them as
highly as they, tho' they may, on all other ac|counts,
be ever &s;o con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>You, Sir, hint at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 44.</NOTE> a very expeditious remedy for
unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing from this quarter; that per&s;ons
of generous and bigotted &s;entiments, &s;hould meet
in different places. In <HI>London</HI> it is certainly practi|cable,
and may perhaps be mo&s;t expedient; but
to attempt any &s;uch &s;eparation in the country,
would be the utter ruin of many of our &s;ocieties,
which now make &s;ome con&s;iderable appearance.
But be&s;ides my regard to the mini&s;ters and &s;ocieties
to which they are related, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have
<PB N="26" REF="26">
too much tenderne&s;s for the per&s;ons them&s;elves, to
be willing intirely to give them up. I have been
intimately acquainted with tho&s;e who have been
accus'd, and perhaps not unju&s;tly, of this unhappy
attachment to human phra&s;es, and nicety in con|trover&s;ial
points; and I mu&s;t do many of them the
ju&s;tice to own, that I have found very excellent
qualities mingled with this exce&s;s of zeal, (which
mu&s;t methinks appear pardonable in them, when
we con&s;ider how artificially it has been infus'd;
and how innocently they have receiv'd and retain'd
it, from a real principle of con&s;cience to God.)
But, indulging them in this one article, &s;everal of
them will appear to be per&s;ons of &s;o much humi|lity
and piety, of &s;o much integrity and genero&s;ity,
of &s;o much activity and zeal for the common in|tere&s;t,
that &s;eparate from all views to private ad|vantage
or reputation, one would heartily wi&s;h to
do all he hone&s;tly can, to remove tho&s;e prejudices,
which give them &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, and impair
the lu&s;tre of &s;o many virtues and graces. And
if at the &s;ame time we can &s;ecure their e&s;teem and
friend&s;hip, it may have &s;uch an influence, both on
our own comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s in life, that it
mu&s;t be great ignorance or pride to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P>You will readily grant, Sir, that the thing is in
it &s;elf de&s;irable: The great que&s;tion is, how it
may be effected? And here I will venture to &s;ay
freely, that I apprehend bigotry of all kinds, to
be a fortre&s;s, which may be attack'd by &s;ap more
&s;ucce&s;sfully than by &s;torm. It is evident that we
have mo&s;t of us &s;omething of the humour of
children, that gra&s;p a thing &s;o much the more
eagerly, when an attempt is made to wre&s;t it out
of their hands by violence; and yet perhaps will
drop it them&s;elves in a few minutes, if you can
but divert their attention to &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27">
From &s;uch a view of things, I apprehend, we
are to judge of the mo&s;t proper methods of deal|ing
with tho&s;e, who&s;e ca&s;e is now under con&s;ide|ration.
You, Sir, may tell them again, and again,
with your natural coolne&s;s and moderation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, p. 34, 37.</NOTE><HI>That
it would be an in&s;tance of their mode&s;ty to re&s;ign their
plea&s;ures to the general notions and judgment&mdash;that
in&s;tead of a&s;&s;uming the characters of judges and cen&s;ors,
they &s;hould put on the humble temper of learners&mdash;
and receive the truth without being jealous of here&s;y
in our younger preachers&mdash;</HI>And at the &s;ame time,
that you are thus giving your advice, you may
give your rea&s;ons, as clearly and hand&s;omely, as you
have given them for Nonconformity in this Enqui|ry;
yet after all, you will probably find, that the
<HI>Civium Ardor</HI> PRAVA JUBENTIUM will
out-noi&s;e the voice of the charmer, charming ever
&s;o wi&s;ely. And &s;hould I exert my &s;elf with greater
warmth and eagerne&s;s, &s;hould I grow a bigot in
the defence of catholici&s;m, and load tho&s;e of diffe|rent
&s;entiments with reproaches, becau&s;e they
have profited no better by &s;o many &s;olid argu|ments;
I &s;hould indeed pay a very great compli|ment
to them, in &s;uppo&s;ing them capable of know|ing,
and admitting truth, under &s;o di&s;agreeable a
di&s;gui&s;e; but it would be at the expence of my
own character and ea&s;e, and I &s;hould run the risk
of being &s;everely &s;corch'd by that flame, which I
pretended to extingui&s;h, by pouring on oil.</P>
<P>I cannot but think it much more advi&s;eable, ac|cording
to the Apo&s;tle's maxim of <HI>becoming all
things to all men,</HI> to &s;tudy to accommodate our
&s;elves in this re&s;pect, as well as in others, to the
infirmities of our hearers, as far as with a &s;afe
con&s;cience we may. If we can put a tolerably
<PB N="28" REF="28">
good &s;en&s;e on any of their favourite phra&s;es, it
would &s;urely be a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable &s;tiffne&s;s and
perver&s;ene&s;s of temper, to avoid it merely becau&s;e
they admire it. Or if we cannot go &s;o far, we
may at lea&s;t lay a&s;ide any darling phra&s;es of our
own, which we know will be offen&s;ive to them.
(For if the Bible be a compleat rule, <HI>our</HI> human
forms are no more nece&s;&s;ary than <HI>theirs.</HI>) Chri&s;tians
as &s;uch profe&s;s a reverence for the Scripture, and
many of the&s;e chri&s;tians have a di&s;tingui&s;hing re|gard
to it, as they have felt its divine energy on
their &s;ouls. Now, Sir, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
better judgment of my brethren, I think we,
who are Mini&s;ters, &s;hould take them by the handle,
and &s;hould labour to di&s;cover to them, more and
more, the beauty and fulne&s;s of the word of God,
not only with regard to this or that particular
doctrine, but to the whole &s;y&s;tem of truth and
duty contain'd in it. 'Tis a &s;ubject on which we
might &s;peak, and they would hear with plea&s;ure;
and it would not only divert their attention, and
their zeal from other things, which might give
unea&s;ine&s;s, but would have a direct tendency to
enlarge their views, and &s;weeten their tempers,
beyond all our encomiums on liberty and catho|lici&s;m,
or our &s;atyrs on bigotry and impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e apprehend, that a regard to what
was &s;aid under the former heads, will farther
conduce to this happy end. When the&s;e exact
people hear us preaching in a truly &s;piritual and
experimental &s;train, and at the &s;ame time in &s;uch
a rational and graceful manner, as may &s;et our
di&s;cour&s;es above contempt, and make them agree|able
to the younger and politer part of our au|ditory,
as well as to others; they will quickly &s;ee
that it is not for their own intere&s;t, or that of
their children, to drive us away with a rigorous
<PB N="29" REF="29">
&s;everity. And therefore, in&s;tead of &s;tudying to
find us hereticks, they will rather put the mo&s;t
favourable &s;en&s;e on ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, and
labour to believe us as orthodox as they can:
Or, if they &s;u&s;pect us to be in the dark as to
&s;ome particulars, yet they will charitably hope,
that age and experience will perfect what is
wanting; and that <HI>God will reveal it to us</HI> in his
own time. With the&s;e views they will chearfully
commit them&s;elves to our mini&s;terial care, if pro|vidence
&s;eems to open a way for our &s;ettlement a|mong&s;t
them. And when they find, that they are
hand&s;omely treated by us, that no direct attack is
made upon their darling notions; but that the
great concerns of practical religion (as dear to
them as to any people upon earth) are plainly
and faithfully pur&s;ued by us, both in publick and
private (to the refre&s;hment of their own &s;ouls,
and to the evident advantage of many others)
they will contract a tender, growing affection for
us: And thus their bigotry will gradually wear
away, till perhaps they come at la&s;t joyfully to
embrace tho&s;e more generous notions, from which
they would at fir&s;t have &s;tarted back with hor|ror.</P>
<P>Thus we may, after the example of our great
ma&s;ter, teach our followers, as they are able to
bear it: And by this moderation, may be in&s;trumen|tal
in healing the breaches which we profe&s;s to la|ment,
in re&s;cuing many an excellent &s;oul from
a painful and di&s;honourable bondage; and in
&s;preading a generous, candid, chri&s;tian &s;pirit,
which will be the glory and happine&s;s of our
Intere&s;t in general, as well as of the particular
&s;ocieties under our care. And in the mean time
another generation will be ri&s;ing, whom we may
hope to form, in a manner agreeable to our
<PB N="30" REF="30">
own &s;entiments, who may tran&s;mit to remote
ages, tho&s;e united principles of piety and ca|tholici&s;m,
which they have happily learnt from
us.</P>
<P>I cannot but think, that &s;uch rational and no|ble
pro&s;pects may encourage us to &s;ubmit to &s;ome
re&s;traints, which we &s;hould not otherwi&s;e have
cho&s;e. But if, after all, we inflexibly in&s;i&s;t on
"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE><HI>as unbounded a liberty of &s;peaking our &s;entiments
in publick, as of forming them in private,</HI>" or in
the language of <HI>Solomon, of uttering all our mind,</HI>
I think we &s;hall dearly purcha&s;e the plea&s;ure of
hearing our &s;elves talk, on a &s;ubject on which we
can do little more, than echo back a part of what
has been &s;o copiou&s;ly and judiciou&s;ly written, and
&s;o frequently repeated by others. The wi&s;er part
of mankind will look upon us as forward heirs,
who &s;pend our e&s;tate of reputation and impor|tance
in life, before we come to it; and upon the
whole, we &s;hall not only exceedingly injure our
&s;elves in private life, which is comparatively but a
trifle, but &s;hall impair our future u&s;efulne&s;s, and
even wound the darling cau&s;e of liberty, to which
we are &s;o ready to &s;acrifice all. For I &s;eriou&s;ly
declare, that if I could be &s;o wicked as to form a
de&s;ign again&s;t it, and &s;o ba&s;e as to pro&s;ecure it by
clande&s;tine and hypocritical methods, I would only
&s;et my &s;elf to declaim in its favour, with impru|dent
zeal, and unbounded fury.</P>
<P>You have now, Sir, all that I think it proper to
&s;ay, at pre&s;ent, concerning the methods by which
I apprehend tho&s;e of us, who are imploy'd in the
mini&s;try, may mo&s;t effectually contribute to the
revival of the Di&s;&s;enting Intere&s;t. I can a&s;&s;ure
you, they are not the reveries of my own clo&s;et,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
but ob&s;ervations which I have drawn from life, as
occa&s;ions have occur'd in conver&s;ing with a variety
of per&s;ons, of different &s;tations, reli&s;hes, and cha|racters.
I have the better opinion of many of them,
as I know that they are thoroughly agreeable to
the &s;entiments and conduct of &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable per&s;ons of all denominations among&s;t
us, both in town and country; who&s;e friend&s;hip
is the honour and plea&s;ure of my life. I am par|ticularly
confirm'd in this way of thinking, by ob|&s;erving
the &s;ucce&s;s which &s;uch mea&s;ures have had
in the congregations of my fathers and brethren in
the&s;e parts. For I know, that in many of them,
the number of Di&s;&s;enters is greatly increas'd
within the&s;e twenty years; and the intere&s;t con|tinues
&s;o to flouri&s;h, that I am confident &s;ome of
our hone&s;t people, who conver&s;e only in their own
neighbourhood, will be &s;urpriz'd to hear of <HI>an En|quiry
into the cau&s;es of its decay.</HI></P>
<P>If what I have writ appear rea&s;onable to you,
Sir, I cannot but wi&s;h that you, and other gentle|men
of the laity, who are heartily concern'd for
our intere&s;t, would endeavour to cultivate &s;uch
&s;entiments as the&s;e in the minds of young mini&s;ters
of your acquaintance. We are naturally very
de&s;irous of being known to you, and &s;ingled out
as the object of your regard. Whereas we early
begin to look with a comparative contempt upon
the meaner &s;ort of people, as an ignoble Herd&mdash;
<HI>Fruges con&s;umere nati&mdash;</HI> Whil&s;t engag'd in our
preparatory &s;tudies, we are indeed &s;o generous,
as to give up one another to the vulgar; but we
have each of us the penetration to di&s;cover, that
there is &s;omething uncommon in our dear &s;elves,
by which nature &s;eems to have intended us to be
(as we ab&s;urdly enough expre&s;s it) orators for
the polite. The&s;e arrogant and pernicious &s;en|timents
<PB N="32" REF="32">
we &s;ometimes carry along with us, from
the academy to the pulpit; where perhaps, we
make our fir&s;t appearance infinitely &s;olicitous
about every trifling circum&s;tance of a di&s;cour&s;e,
yet negligent of that which &s;hould be the &s;oul of
it. And if the people are not as much charm'd
with it as our&s;elves, we have then an evident
demon&s;tration of their incorrigible &s;tupidity; and
&s;o re&s;entment concurs with pride and ambition,
to &s;et us at the remote&s;t di&s;tance from tho&s;e, who
ought to be the objects of our tendere&s;t re|gards.</P>
<P>If an elder mini&s;ter have &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion
and genero&s;ity, as to deal freely with us upon
the&s;e heads, and give us &s;uch advice as cir|cum&s;tances
require, 'tis great odds but we find
&s;ome excu&s;e for neglecting what he &s;ays&mdash;
"He is ignorant and unpolite; or perhaps in|toxicated
with his own popularity, and means
his coun&s;els to us as encomiums upon him|&s;elf."&mdash;Or
if neither of the&s;e will do,
&s;ome other artifice mu&s;t be found out, to fix
the blame any where rather than at home. And
if in the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and mortifications, we
can but find out one gentleman of fortune, &s;en&s;e,
and learning, that admires us, we are happy.
A &s;ingle diamond is worth more than a whole
load of pebbles; and we perhaps adapt, with
va&s;t &s;atisfaction, the celebrated words of <HI>Arbu&s;cula</HI>
in <HI>Horace</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hor. Sat. Lib. I. x. v. 78, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
<Q>Men' moveat Cimex Pantilius, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Without con&s;idering that what was highly pro|per
in the mouth of a player, and a poet, would
<PB N="33" REF="33">
be extremely ab&s;urd in a Heathen, and much
more in a Chri&s;tian Orator.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, what I intend by all this, is
to &s;hew that you gentlemen may have it in
your power to do a great deal to correct
the&s;e mi&s;taken notions. If we plainly &s;ee that
you regard us, not merely according to the
manner in which our performances are ac|commodated
to your own private ta&s;te, but
according to our de&s;ire and capacity of be|ing
u&s;eful to the publick intere&s;t, we &s;hall
perhaps be taught to place our point of ho|nour
right; and when that is once done,
a moderate degree of genius, application, and
prudence, may be &s;ufficient, by the ble&s;&s;ing of
God, to &s;ecure the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I would here, Sir, have ended my Letter,
but the hints you give in the conclu&s;ion of
yours concerning <HI>Academical Education,</HI> lead me
to add a few words on that head. I would
be far from the in&s;olence of pretending to
teach tutors; but I apprehend that if my for|mer
principles be allow'd, it will follow, by
the ea&s;ie&s;t con&s;equence in the world, that it
is a very important part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, to
form their pupils to a regard for the people,
and to a manner of preaching, and of conver&s;e,
which may be agreeable to them.</P>
<P>There is hardly any thing which &s;hould be
more di&s;couraged in a young &s;tudent, than
&s;uch a mi&s;taken haughty way of thinking, as I
&s;o freely de&s;cribed a little above, e&s;pecially when
it di&s;covers it&s;elf in a petulant inclination to
employ their talent at &s;atyr, in ridiculing the
infirmities of plain &s;erious Chri&s;tians, or the
labours of tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who are willing to
<PB N="34" REF="34">
conde&s;cend to the meane&s;t capacities, that they
may be wi&s;e to win &s;ouls.</P>
<P>A young man of &s;en&s;e will ea&s;ily enter into
&s;uch plain rea&s;onings as I have offered in the
beginning of this Letter, and be convinced by
them, that if he ever appear under the cha|racter
of a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, he mu&s;t not
neglect the people. But it is greatly to be
de&s;ired, that our &s;tudents may be engaged to
regard them, not merely from political, but re|ligious
views.</P>
<P>It is therefore, no doubt, the care of every
pious tutor among&s;t us, (and may God make
it a more con&s;tant and &s;ucce&s;sful care) to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
his pupils, who are de&s;ign'd for the mi|ni&s;try,
with a deep and early &s;en&s;e of the im|portance
of the go&s;pel-&s;cheme, for the reco|very
of man from the ruins of the apo&s;tacy,
and his re&s;toration to God, and happine&s;s by
a mediator.&mdash;To &s;hew (as it may ea&s;ily be
&s;hewn) that this has been the great end of
the divine coun&s;els, with regard to which, the
harmony of nature in the lower world has
been &s;upported, and the various oeconomies of
providence di&s;po&s;ed:&mdash;To point out the
Son of God de&s;cending from heaven in favour
of this de&s;ign, pur&s;uing it by humble conde|&s;cen&s;ions
for the lowe&s;t of the people, and un|wearied
labours among&s;t them; and at la&s;t,
e&s;tabli&s;hing it by agonies and death:&mdash;To
&s;hew them the Apo&s;tles taking up their ma|&s;ter's
cau&s;e, pro&s;ecuting it with unwearied vi|gour
and re&s;olution, and &s;acrificing to it their
ea&s;e, their reputation, their liberty, and their
lives:&mdash;To trace out tho&s;e generous e|motions
of &s;oul, which &s;till live and breathe
in their immortal writings:&mdash;And then
<PB N="35" REF="35">
(when their minds are warmed with &s;uch a
&s;urvey) to apply to the &s;tudents them&s;elves,
as per&s;ons de&s;igned by Providence, to engage
in the &s;ame work, to &s;upport and carry on
the &s;ame intere&s;t, who therefore mu&s;t be
acted by the &s;ame views, and imbibe the &s;ame
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>Something of this kind is, I doubt not, at|tended
to; and I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay,
that I think the&s;e the mo&s;t important lectures
a tutor can read. You cannot but &s;ee, Sir,
that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;uch addre&s;&s;es
mu&s;t have an apparent tendency to fill the
mind with &s;ublime and elevated views, and to
make a man feel and own too, (though it may
appear &s;omething unpolite) that the &s;alvation of
one &s;oul, is of infinitely greater importance,
than charming a thou&s;and &s;plendid a&s;&s;emblies,
with the mo&s;t elegant di&s;cour&s;es that were ever
delivered. A young mini&s;ter under the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions,
will come out to his publick work
<HI>naturally di&s;po&s;ed to care for the &s;tate of his peo|ple</HI>;
and &s;uch &s;incere zeal and tenderne&s;s will
form him to a popular addre&s;s, abundantly
&s;ooner, and more happily, than the mo&s;t judi|cious
rules which it is po&s;&s;ible to dictate.</P>
<P>As examples are the be&s;t illu&s;tration of pre|cepts,
it mu&s;t certainly be a great advantage
to pupils to hear &s;uch preaching, and &s;ee &s;uch
pa&s;toral care, as is recommended to them in
the lecture-room. A prudent man, who is con|cerned
in the education of young mini&s;ters,
will be particularly careful to avoid tho&s;e faults
in preaching, which they are in the greate&s;t
danger of falling into; and particularly too ab|&s;tracted
a train of rea&s;oning, and too great a
care about the little ornaments of &s;peech, when

addre&s;&s;ing to a common auditory. And if
(where other circum&s;tances may allow it) he
&s;ometimes engage the attendance of &s;enior pu|pils
in his pa&s;toral vi&s;its, and introduce them
to the acquaintance and freedom of &s;ome &s;e|rious
Chri&s;tians in the &s;ociety, it may be much
for their improvement. A more intimate know|ledge
of their hidden worth, and perhaps of
tho&s;e noble traces of natural genius, which
they might di&s;cover among&s;t &s;ome of a very
low education, would &s;omething increa&s;e their
e&s;teem for the populace in general. And from
their ob&s;ervations on books and &s;ermons,
and their accounts of the various exerci&s;es of
their minds, (where our politer hearers are
generally more re&s;erv'd) a man may be&s;t learn
how they are to be addre&s;s'd, and form him|&s;elf
to that experimental &s;train, on which &s;o
much of his acceptance and u&s;efulne&s;s among&s;t
us will depend.</P>
<P>If you apprehend, Sir, that &s;uch a cour&s;e
will make them preachers for the vulgar, <HI>and
for them only</HI>; I think it &s;ufficient to an&s;wer,
that I intirely agree with you in what you &s;ay
of the great advantages of an intimate ac|quaintance
with the learned languages, and
the cla&s;&s;ical writers both of the <HI>Romans</HI> and
<HI>Greeks.</HI> I heartily wi&s;h our &s;tudents may al|ways
be well furni&s;hed with it before they
leave the &s;chools, and think it highly proper
it &s;hould be carried on through the whole of
their academical cour&s;e. And I cannot ima|gine,
that a man of tolerable &s;en&s;e, who is
every day conver&s;ing with &s;ome of the fine&s;t
writers of antiquity, and who is (as mo&s;t of
our &s;tudents are) a little exerci&s;ed in the ma|thematical
&s;ciences, (to teach him attention of
<PB N="37" REF="37">
thought, and &s;trength, and per&s;picuity of rea|&s;oning)
will be in great danger of &s;aying any
thing remarkably impertinent, or contemptibly
low.</P>
<P>As for being ma&s;ters of our own language,
'tis a point which I think &s;hould be thorough|ly
labour'd from the very beginning of their
education. They &s;hould to be &s;ure make them|&s;elves
familiarly acquainted with tho&s;e writers,
which are allowed to be the &s;tandards of it,
and &s;hould frequently be tran&s;lating and com|po&s;ing.
And if this be not only practi&s;ed at
&s;chool, but continued through four or five
years of academical education, they will have
formed a habit of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves grace|fully,
or at lea&s;t tolerably well: So that in
their ordinary compo&s;ures, when they have
dige&s;ted their materials, and ranged their
thoughts, they will often find proper, expre&s;&s;ive,
and elegant words, flowing in fa&s;ter than they
can write them.</P>
<P>And as compo&s;ition is far from being the
only bu&s;ine&s;s of an orator; &s;o I heartily wi&s;h,
that not only tutors, but &s;chool-ma&s;ters (who&s;e
character and conduct, by the way, is of
va&s;t importance to our intere&s;t) would make
a very &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s of teaching lads, who
are de&s;ign'd for the mini&s;try, to read well,
and to pronounce properly and hand&s;omely.
Thus an early remedy would be provided
on the one hand, again&s;t tho&s;e unnatural
tones and ge&s;tures, which (as you well ob|&s;erve)
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enq. p. 43.</NOTE><HI>are a grand cau&s;e of our reproach and
contempt</HI>; and on the other, again&s;t that
cold in&s;en&s;ible air, which &s;ometimes, among&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="38">
&s;trangers at lea&s;t, affects even the moral cha|racter
of the preacher.</P>
<P>I think &s;ome care &s;hould be taken, both at the
&s;chool and the academy, to engage &s;tudents to a
genteel and complai&s;ant behaviour, not only as
what is apparently conducive to their mutual
ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, and the convenience of the
family where they are; but as what may
render them more agreeable and u&s;eful in
life, to per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank, and even
to the populace them&s;elves. For a well-bred
man knows how to conde&s;cend, in the mo&s;t
obliging way; and the common people (&s;uch
is either their good &s;en&s;e or their humour)
are peculiarly pleas'd with the vi&s;its and
conver&s;e of tho&s;e, who they know may be
welcome to greater company.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have done with my &s;ub|ject,
and mu&s;t conclude, with a&s;&s;uring you,
that it is not the de&s;ign of one line which
I have writ, merely to prove, that you are
mi&s;taken in any thing that you have a&s;&s;erted;
and therefore I have purpo&s;ely avoided many
citations from your Letter, which might ea&s;ily
have been connected with what I have &s;aid.
You will infer from what you have read, that
I differ from you in &s;ome other particulars,
which are not mention'd, but they apparent|ly
depend on what I have debated at large;
and I cho&s;e to omit them, not only becau&s;e
my Letter is already longer than I intended,
but from a general ob&s;ervation, which I have
had frequent occa&s;ion to make; that if a
man de&s;ires to do good by what he &s;ays,
he mu&s;t oppo&s;e and contradict as little as
po&s;&s;ible. If I am mi&s;taken in what I have
<PB N="39" REF="39">
advanced, I &s;hall be heartily thankful for
better information; and, if it come from
you, it will be peculiarly agreeable, as I &s;hall
have nothing to fear from your reproaches,
and much to hope from your arguments.</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
