<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>_IT will be found a true ob&s;ervation,
tho' &s;omewhat &s;urprizing, that
when any &s;candal is vented again&s;t
a man of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction and
character either in the State or in
Literature, the publick in general afford it a
mo&s;t quiet reception, and the larger part accept it
as favourably as if it were &s;ome kindne&s;s done to
them&s;elves: Whereas if a known &s;coundrel or
blockhead chance to be but touch'd upon, a whole
legion is up in Arms, and it becomes the common
Cau&s;e of all Scriblers, Book&s;ellers, and Printers
what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Not to &s;earch too deeply into the rea&s;on hereof, I
will only ob&s;erve as a <HI>Fact,</HI> that every week for
the&s;e two Months pa&s;t, the town has been per&s;e|cuted
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
with Pamphlets, Adverti&s;ements, Letters,
and weekly E&s;&s;ays, not only again&s;t the Wit and
Writings, but again&s;t the Character and Per&s;on,
of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI> And that of all tho&s;e men who have
received plea&s;ure from his Writings (which by
mode&s;t computation may be about a hundred
thou&s;and in the&s;e Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
not to mention <HI>Jer&s;cy, Guern&s;ey,</HI> the
<HI>Orcades,</HI> tho&s;e in the <HI>New world,</HI> and <HI>Foreign|ers</HI>
who have tran&s;lated him into their languages)
of all this number, not a man hath &s;tood up to
&s;ay one word in his defence.</P>
<P>The only exception is the Author of the follow|ing
Poem, who doubtle&s;s had either a better in|&s;ight
into the grounds of this clamour, or a bet|ter
opinion of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s integrity, join'd with
a greater per&s;onal love for him, than any other
of his numerous friends and admirers.</P>
<P>Further, that he was in his peculiar intima|cy,
appears from the knowledge he manife&s;ts of
the mo&s;t <HI>private</HI> Authors of all the <HI>anonymous</HI>
pieces again&s;t him, and from his having in this
Poem attacked no man living, who had not be|fore
printed and publi&s;hed again&s;t this particular
Gentleman.</P>
<P>How I became po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, is of no concern to
<PB N="v" REF="7">
the Reader; but it would have been a wrong to
him, had I detain'd this publication: &s;ince tho&s;e
<HI>Names</HI> which are its chief ornaments, die off dai|ly
&s;o fa&s;t, as mu&s;t render it too &s;oon unintelligible.
If it provoke the Author to give us a more per|fect
edition, I have my end.</P>
<P>Who he is, I cannot &s;ay, and (which is great
pity) there is certainly nothing in his &s;tyle and
manner of writing, which can di&s;tingui&s;h, or
di&s;cover him. For if it bears any re&s;emblance
to that of Mr. <HI>P.</HI> 'tis not improbable but it
might be done on purpo&s;e, with a view to have
it pa&s;s for his. But by the frequency of his
allu&s;ions to <HI>Virgil,</HI> and a <HI>labour'd,</HI> (not to &s;ay
<HI>affected, &s;hortne&s;s,</HI> in imitation of him, I &s;hould
think him more an admirer of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet
than of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> and in that, not of the
&s;ame ta&s;te with his Friend.</P>
<P>I have been well inform'd, that this work
was the labour of full &s;ix years of his life, and
that he retired him&s;elf entirely from all the
avocations and plea&s;ures of the world, to attend
diligently to its correction and perfection; and
&s;ix years more he intended to be&s;tow upon it, as
it &s;hould &s;eem by this ver&s;e of <HI>Statius,</HI> which
was cited at the head of his manu&s;cript.
<Q><PB N="vi" REF="8">
<L>Oh mihi bi&s;&s;enos multum vigilata per annos,</L>
<L>Duncia!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we learn the true <HI>Title</HI> of the
Poem; which with the &s;ame certainty as we
call that of <HI>Homer</HI> the <HI>Iliad,</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> the
<HI>Aeneid,</HI> of <HI>Camoens</HI> the <HI>Lu&s;iad,</HI> of <HI>Voltaire</HI>
the <HI>Henriad,</HI> we may pronounce could have
been, and can be no other, than<Q>THE DUNCIAD.</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;tyled <HI>Heroic,</HI> as being <HI>doubly</HI> &s;o;
not only with re&s;pect to its nature, which ac|cording
to the be&s;t Rules of the Ancients and
&s;tricte&s;t ideas of the Moderns, is critically &s;uch;
but al&s;o with regard to the Heroical di&s;po&s;ition
and high courage of the Writer, who dar'd
to &s;tir up &s;uch a formidable, irritable, and
implacable race of mortals.</P>
<P>The time and date of the Action is evident|ly
in the la&s;t reign, when the office of City
Poet expir'd upon the death of <HI>Elkanah Set|tle,</HI>
and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of
Sir <HI>Geo. Tho<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ld.</HI> But there may ari&s;e
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
&s;ome ob&s;curity in Chronology from the <HI>Names</HI>
in the Poem, by the inevitable removal of
&s;ome Authors, and In&s;ertion of others, in their
Niches. For whoever will con&s;ider the unity
of the whole de&s;ign, will be &s;en&s;ible, that the
<HI>Poem was not made for the&s;e Authors, but
the&s;e Authors for the Poem.</HI> And I &s;hould
judge they were clapp'd in as they ro&s;e, fre&s;h
and fre&s;h, and chang'd from day to day, in
like manner as when the old boughs wither,
we thru&s;t new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much trou|bled
or anxious, if he cannot decypher them;
&s;ince when he &s;hall have found them out, he
will probably know no more of the Per&s;ons
than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to pre&s;erve them as
they are, than to change them for fictitious
names, by which the Satyr would only be mul|tiplied;
and applied to many in&s;tead of one.
Had the Hero, for in&s;tance, been called <HI>Co|drus,</HI>
how many would have affirm'd him to
be Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Sir <HI>R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI>
&amp;c. but now, all that unju&s;t &s;candal is &s;aved,
by calling him <HI>Theobald,</HI> which by good luck
happens to be the name of a real per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10">
I am indeed aware, that this name may
to &s;ome appear too mean, for the Hero of an
Epic Poem? But it is hoped, they will alter
that opinion, when they find, that an Author
no le&s;s eminent than <HI>la Bruyere,</HI> has thought
him worthy a place in his Characters.<Q><P>Voudriez vous, THEOBALDE, que je
