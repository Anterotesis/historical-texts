<P>THE PREFACE.</P>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is not doubted but the candid Reader will find the following <HI>BOOK</HI> in Cor|respondence with the Title, which will super|sede the Necessity of any other Recommendation that might be given of it.</P>
<P>As the Compiler of it engaged in the Un|dertaking at the Instance and Importunity of many Persons of eminent Account and Dis|tinction, so she can truly assure them, and the World, that she has acquitted herself with the utmost Care and Fidelity.</P>
<P>And she entertains the greater Hopes that her Performance will meet with the kinder Acceptance, because of the good Opinion she has been held in by those, her ever honoured Friends, who first excited her to the Publica|tion of her Book, and who have been long Eye-Witnesses of her Skill and Behaviour in the Business of her Calling.</P>
<P>She has nothing to add, but her humblest Thanks to them, and to all others from whom she has received Favour and Encouragement.</P>

<P>You must send up the Mutton Chops in the Dish with the Hotch-Potch.</P>
