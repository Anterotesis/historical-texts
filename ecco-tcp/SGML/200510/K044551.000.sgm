</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE u&s;e of many of the precepts and maxims of &s;cripture,
is not &s;o much to pre&s;cribe actions, as to generate &s;ome
certain turn and habit of thinking: and they are then only ap|plied
as they ought to be, when they furni&s;h us with &s;uch a
view of, and &s;uch a way of con&s;idering, the &s;ubject to which
they relate, as may rectify and meliorate our di&s;po&s;itions;
for from di&s;po&s;itions, &s;o rectified and meliorated, particular
good actions, and particular good rules of acting, flow of
their own accord. This is true of the great chri&s;tian maxims
of loving our neighbour as our&s;elves; of doing to others, as
we would that others &s;hould do to us; and (as will appear,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
I hope, in the &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e) of that of the text.
The&s;e maxims being well impre&s;&s;ed, the detail of conduct
may be left to it&s;elf. The &s;ubtleties of ca&s;ui&s;try, I had almo&s;t
&s;aid the &s;cience, may be &s;pared. By pre&s;enting to the mind
one fixed con&s;ideration, &s;uch a temper is at length formed within
us, that our fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions and fir&s;t impul&s;es are &s;ure almo&s;t
of being on the &s;ide of virtue; and that we feel likewi&s;e an
almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible inclination to be governed by them. When
this di&s;po&s;ition is perfected, the influence of religion, as a
moral in&s;titution, is &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is not in this way, but in another, that human laws, e&s;pe|cially
the laws of free countries, proceed to attain their objects.
Fora&s;much as <HI>their</HI> ultimate &s;anctions are to be di&s;pen&s;ed by
fallible men, in&s;tead of an unerring and omni&s;cient judge, the
&s;afety, as well as the liberty, of the &s;ubject, requires, that di&s;|cretion
&s;hould be bound down by preci&s;e rules both of acting,
and of judging of actions. Hence lawgivers have been obliged
to multiply directions and prohibitions without number: and
this nece&s;&s;ity, for &s;uch I acknowledge it to be, hath drawn
them into a prolixity, which incumbers the law as a &s;cience
to tho&s;e who &s;tudy or admini&s;ter it; and &s;ometimes perplexes
it, as a rule of conduct, to tho&s;e who have nothing to do with:
it, but to obey it. Yet &s;till they find them&s;elves unable
to make laws as fa&s;t as occa&s;ions demand them: they find them|&s;elves
<PB N="7" REF="5">
perpetually called upon to pur&s;ue, by fre&s;h paths, the
inventive ver&s;atility of human fraud, or to provide for new and
unfore&s;een varieties of &s;ituation. Now &s;hould religion, which
profe&s;&s;es to guide the whole train and range of a man's con|duct,
interior as well as external, dome&s;tic as well as civil;
and which, con&s;equently, extends the operations of its rules
to many things which the laws leave indifferent and uncon|trolled;
&s;hould religion, I &s;ay, once &s;et about to imitate the
preci&s;ion of human laws, the volume of its precepts would &s;oon
be rendered u&s;ele&s;s by its bulk, and unintelligible by its intri|cacy.
The religion of Mahomet, as might be expected from
the religion of a military prophet, con&s;tituted it&s;elf into the
law of the &s;tates into which it was received. A&s;&s;uming the
functions of legi&s;lators and magi&s;trates, in conjunction with
the character of interpreters of the Koran and depo&s;itaries of
the &s;upplemental laws of the religion, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the
Arabian have, under the name of traditionary rules, compiled
a code for the direction of their followers in almo&s;t every
part of their conduct. The <HI>&s;eventy-five thou&s;and</HI> precepts of that
code<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hamilton's tran&s;lation of the Hedaya or Guide.</NOTE> &s;erve only to &s;hew the futility of the attempt; to
prove by experiment, that religion can only act upon human
life by general precepts, addre&s;&s;ed and applied to the di&s;po&s;i|tion;
<PB N="8" REF="6">
that there is no ground for the objection, that has &s;ome|times
been made to chri&s;tianity, that it is defective, as a mo|ral
in&s;titution, for the want of more explicit, more circum&s;tan|tial,
and more accurate directions; and that when we place by
the &s;ide of each other human and divine laws, without under|&s;tanding
the di&s;tinction in the two methods by which they
&s;eek to attain their purpo&s;e, and the rea&s;on of that di&s;tinction,
we form a compari&s;on between them, which is likely to be
injurious to both. We may find fault with the &s;criptures, for
not giving us the preci&s;ion of civil laws; and we may blame
the laws, for not being content with the conci&s;ene&s;s and &s;im|plicity
of &s;cripture: and our cen&s;ure in both ca&s;es be unfound|ed
and unde&s;erved.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of the text is exactly of the nature I have
been alluding to. It &s;upplies a principle. It furni&s;hes us with
a view of our duty, and of the relations in which we are placed,
which, if attended to (and no in&s;truction can be of u&s;e with|out
that), will produce in our minds ju&s;t determinations, and,
what are of more value, becau&s;e more wanted, efficacious mo|tives.</P>
<P>"None of us liveth to him&s;elf." We ought to regard our
lives (including under that name our faculties, our opportuni|ties,
our advantages of every kind) not as mere in&s;truments
of per&s;onal gratification, but as due to the &s;ervice of God;
<PB N="9" REF="7">
and as given us to be employed in promoting the purpo&s;e of
his will in the happine&s;s of our fellow creatures. I am not able
to imagine a turn of thought which is better than this. It
encounters the antagoni&s;t, the check, the de&s;troyer of all virtue,
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. It is intelligible to all: to all in different degrees
applicable. It ince&s;&s;antly prompts to exertion, to activity, to
beneficence.</P>
<P>In order to recommend it, and in order to render it as u&s;e|ful
as it is capable of being made, it may be proper to point
out, how the force and truth of the Apo&s;tle's a&s;&s;ertion bears
upon the different cla&s;&s;es of civil &s;ociety. And in this view,
the de&s;cription of men, which fir&s;t, undoubtedly, offers it&s;elf
to our notice, is that of men of public characters; who po&s;&s;e&s;s
offices of importance, power, influence and authority. If the
rule and principle, which I am exhibiting to your ob&s;ervation,
can be &s;aid to be made for one cla&s;s of mankind more than
another, it is for them. "<HI>They,</HI> certainly, live not to them&s;elves."
The de&s;ign, the tenure, the condition of their offices; the
public expectation, the public claim, con&s;ign their lives and
labours, their cares and thoughts and talents, to the public
happine&s;s, wherein&s;oever it is connected with the duties of
their &s;tations, or can be advanced by the fidelity of their &s;er|vices.
There may be occa&s;ions and emergencies when men
are called upon to take part in the public &s;ervice, out of the
<PB N="10" REF="8">
line of their pro&s;e&s;&s;ions, or the ordinary limits of their voca|tion.
But the&s;e emergencies occur, I think, &s;eldom. The
nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be manife&s;t, before we yield to it. A too
great readine&s;s to &s;tart out of our &s;eparate precincts of duty,
in order to ru&s;h into provinces which belong to others, is a
dangerous exce&s;s of zeal. In general the public intere&s;t is be&s;t
upheld, the public quiet always be&s;t pre&s;erved, by each one
attending clo&s;ely to the proper and di&s;tinct duties of his &s;tation.
In &s;ea&s;ons of peril or con&s;ternation, this attention ought to be
doubled. Dangers are not be&s;t oppo&s;ed by tumultuous or di&s;|orderly
exertions; but by a &s;edate, firm, and calm re&s;i&s;tance,
e&s;pecially by that regular and &s;ilent &s;trength, which is the
collected re&s;ult of each man's vigilance and indu&s;try in his
&s;eparate &s;tation. For public men therefore to be active in
the &s;tations a&s;&s;igned to them, is demanded by their country
in the hour of her fear or danger. If ever there was a time,
when they that rule "&s;hould rule with diligence;" when &s;upine|ne&s;s,
negligence, and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in office, when a timidity or
love of ea&s;e, which might in other circum&s;tances be tolerated,
ought to be pro&s;cribed and excluded, it is the pre&s;ent. If ever
there was a time to make the public feel the benefit of public
in&s;titutions, it is this.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall add nothing more concerning the obligation
which the text, and the le&s;&s;on it conveys, impo&s;es upon pub|lic
<PB N="11" REF="9">
men, becau&s;e I think that the principle is too apt to be
con&s;idered as appertaining to them alone. It will therefore
be more u&s;eful to &s;hew, how what are called private &s;tations,
are affected by the &s;ame principle. I &s;ay what are called
private &s;tations, for &s;uch they are, only as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed
from public tru&s;ts, publicly and formally confided. In them|&s;elves,
and accurately e&s;timated, there are few &s;uch; I mean
that there are few &s;o de&s;tined to the private emolument of
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as that they are innocently occupied by him,
when they are occupied with no other attention but to his
own enjoyment. Civil government is con&s;tituted for the
happine&s;s of the governed, and not for the gratification of
tho&s;e who admini&s;ter it. Not only &s;o, but the gradations of
rank in &s;ociety are &s;upported, not for the advantage or plea|&s;ure
of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the highe&s;t places in it, but for the
common good; for the &s;ecurity, the repo&s;e, the protection,
the encouragement of all. They may be very &s;atisfactorily
defended upon this principle: but then this principle ca&s;ts
upon them duties. In particular it teaches every man who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a fortune, to regard him&s;elf as in &s;ome mea&s;ure occu|pying
a public &s;tation; as obliged to make it a channel of
beneficence, an in&s;trument of good to others, and not merely
a &s;upply to him&s;elf of the materials of luxury, o&s;tentation, or
avarice. There is a &s;hare of power and influence nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="12" REF="10">
attendant upon property; upon the right or the wrong u&s;e of
which, the exertion or the neglect, depends no little part of
the virtue or vice, the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the community.
It is in the choice of every man of rank and property, to be|come
the benefactor or the &s;courge, the guardian or the ty|rant,
the example or the corrupter of the virtue, of his &s;er|vants,
his tenants, his neighbourhood; to be the author to
them, of peace or contention, of &s;obriety or di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, of
comfort or di&s;tre&s;s. This power, whence&s;oever it proceeds,
whether expre&s;sly conferred or &s;ilently acquired (for I &s;ee no
difference in the two ca&s;es), brings along with it obligation,
and re&s;pon&s;ibility. It is to be lamented when this con&s;idera|tion
is not known, or not attended to. Two cau&s;es appear
to me to ob&s;truct, to men of this de&s;cription, the view of
their moral &s;ituation. One is, that they do not perceive any
<HI>call</HI> upon them at all; the other, that, if there be one, they do
not &s;ee to what they are called. To the fir&s;t point I would
an&s;wer in the words of an excellent morali&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Abraham Tucker, E&s;q. author of <HI>The Light of Nature,</HI> and of <HI>The Light of Nature and Revelation pur&s;ued,</HI> by Edward Search, E&s;q.</NOTE>, "The delivery
of the talent is the call:" it is the call of Providence, the call
of Heaven. The &s;upply of the means, is the requi&s;ition of
the duty. When we find, our&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of faculties
<PB N="13" REF="11">
and opportunities, whether ari&s;ing from the endowments and
qualities of our minds, or from the advantages of fortune and
&s;tation, we need a&s;k for no further evidence of the intention
of the donor: we ought to &s;ee in that intention a demand
upon us for the u&s;e and application of what has been given.
This is a principle of natural as well as revealed religion;
and it is univer&s;al. Then as to the &s;econd enquiry, the &s;pe|cies
of benevolence, the kind of duty to which we are bound,
it is pointed out to us by the &s;ame indication. To whatever
office of benevolence our faculties are be&s;t fitted, our talents
turned; whatever our opportunities, our occa&s;ions, our for|tune,
our profe&s;&s;ion, our rank or &s;tation, or whatever our lo|cal
circum&s;tances, which are capable of no enumeration, put
in our power to perform with the mo&s;t advantage and effect,
that is the office for us: that it is, which, upon our principle,
we are de&s;igned, and, being de&s;igned, are obliged to di&s;charge.
I think that the judgement of mankind does not often fail them
in the choice of the objects or &s;pecies of their benevolence:
but what fails them is the &s;en&s;e of the obligation, the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of the connection between duty and power, and,
&s;pringing from this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eek oppor|tunities,
or to embrace tho&s;e that occur, of rendering them|&s;elves
u&s;eful to their generation.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e, which keeps out of the &s;ight of tho&s;e who
<PB N="14" REF="12">
are concerned in them, the duties that belong to &s;uperior
&s;tations, is a language, from their infancy familiar to them,
viz. that they are placed above work. I have always con&s;i|dered
this as a mo&s;t unfortunate phra&s;eology. And, as habi|tual
modes of &s;peech have no &s;mall effect upon public &s;enti|ment,
it has a direct tendency to make one portion of man|kind
envious, and the other idle. The truth is, every man
has his work. The kind of work varies, and that is all the
difference there is. A great deal of labour exi&s;ts be&s;ide that
of the hands; many &s;pecies of indu&s;try be&s;ide bodily opera|tion,
equally nece&s;&s;ary, requiring equal a&s;&s;iduity, more atten|tion,
more anxiety. It is not true therefore that men of ele|vated
&s;tations are exempted from work; it is only true that
there is a&s;&s;igned to them work of a different kind: whether
more ea&s;y, or more plea&s;ant, may be que&s;tioned; but certain|ly
not le&s;s wanted, not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the common good.
Were this maxim once properly received as a principle of con|duct,
it would put men of fortune and rank upon enquiring,
what were the opportunities of doing good (for &s;ome, they may
depend upon it, there are) which, in a more e&s;pecial manner,
belonged to their &s;ituation or condition: and were this princi|ple
carried into any thing like its full effect, or even were this
way of thinking &s;ufficiently inculcated, it would completely
remove the invidiou&s;ne&s;s of elevated &s;tations. Mankind would
<PB N="15" REF="13">
&s;ee in them this alternative. If &s;uch men di&s;charged the duties
which were attached to the advantages they enjoyed, they de|&s;erved
the&s;e advantages. If they did not, they were morally
&s;peaking in the &s;ituation of a poor man who neglected his bu|&s;ine&s;s
and his calling; and in no better. And the proper re|flection
in both ca&s;es is the &s;ame: the individual is in a high
degree culpable, yet the bu&s;ine&s;s and the calling beneficial and
expedient.</P>
<P>The habit and the di&s;po&s;ition which we wi&s;h to re|commend,
namely that of ca&s;ting about for opportunities of
doing good, readily &s;eizing tho&s;e which accidentally pre&s;ent
them&s;elves, and faithfully u&s;ing tho&s;e which naturally and re|gularly
belong to our &s;ituations, appear to be &s;ometimes check|ed
by a notion, very natural to active &s;pirits, and to flattered
talents. They will not be content to do little things. They
will either attempt mighty matters, or do nothing. The &s;mall
effects, which the private endeavours of an individual can pro|duce
upon the ma&s;s of &s;ocial good, is &s;o lo&s;t, and &s;o unper|ceived,
in the compari&s;on, that it neither de&s;erves, they think,
nor rewards the attention which it requires. The an&s;wer is,
that the compari&s;on, which thus di&s;courages them, ought ne|ver
to be made. The good which their efforts can produce,
may be too minute to bear any &s;en&s;ible proportion to the &s;um
of public happine&s;s, yet may be their &s;hare; may be enough
<PB N="16" REF="14">
for them. The proper que&s;tion is not, whether the good we
aim at be great or little; &s;till le&s;s, whether it be great or little
in compari&s;on with the whole; but whether it be the mo&s;t
which it is in our power to perform. A &s;ingle action may be, as
it were, nothing to the aggregate of moral good; &s;o al&s;o may be
the agent. It may &s;till therefore be the proportion, which is
required of <HI>him.</HI> In all things nature works by numbers. Her
greate&s;t effects are achieved by the joint operation of multi|tudes
of, &s;eparately con&s;idered, in&s;ignificant individuals. It
is enough for each that it executes its office. It is not its con|cern,
becau&s;e it does not depend upon its will, what place that
office holds in, or what proportion it bears to, the general re&s;ult.
Let our only compari&s;on therefore be, between our opportuni|ties
and the u&s;e which we make of them. When we would
extend our views, or &s;tretch out our hand, to di&s;tant and ge|neral
good, we are commonly lo&s;t and &s;unk in the magnitude
of the &s;ubject. Particular good, and the particular good which
lies within our reach, is all we are concerned to attempt, or to
enquire about. Not the &s;malle&s;t effort will be forgotten; not a
particle of our virtue will fall to the ground. Whether &s;ucce&s;sful
or not, our endeavours will be recorded; will be e&s;timated, not
according to the proportion which they bear to the univer&s;al
intere&s;t, but according to the relation which they hold to our
means and opportunities; according to the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s,
<PB N="17" REF="15">
the &s;incerity, with which we undertook; the pains and per&s;eve|rance
with which we carried them on. It may be true, and I
think it is the doctrine of &s;cripture, that the right u&s;e of great
faculties or great opportunities, will be more highly rewarded,
than the right u&s;e of inferior faculties and le&s;s opportunities.
He that, with ten talents, had made ten talents more, was placed
over ten cities. The neglected talent was al&s;o given to him.
He who, with five talents, had made five more, though pro|nounced
to be a good and faithful &s;ervant, was placed only over
five cities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 25 et &s;eq.</NOTE>. This di&s;tinction might, without any great har&s;h|ne&s;s
to our moral feelings, be re&s;olved into the will of the &s;u|preme
benefactor: but we can &s;ee perhaps enough of the &s;ub|ject
to perceive that it was ju&s;t. The merit may rea&s;onably be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been more in one ca&s;e, than the other. The
danger, the activity, the care, the &s;olicitude, were greater.
Still both received rewards, abundant beyond mea&s;ure when
compared with the &s;ervices, equitable and proportioned when
compared with one another.</P>
<P>That our obligation is commen&s;urate with our opportunity,
and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the opportunity is &s;ufficient, without
any further or more formal command, to create the obligation,
is a principle of morality and of &s;cripture; and is alike true in
<PB N="18" REF="16">
all countries. But that power and property &s;o far go together,
as to con&s;titute private fortunes into public &s;tations, as to
ca&s;t upon large portions of the community occa&s;ions which render
the preceding principles more con&s;tantly applicable, is the effect
of civil in&s;titutions, and is found in no country more than in
ours; if in any &s;o much. With us a great part of the public
bu&s;ine&s;s of the country, is tran&s;acted by the country it&s;elf:
and upon the prudent and faithful management of it, depends,
in a very con&s;iderable degree, the interior pro&s;perity of the
nation, and the &s;atisfaction of great bodies of the people. Not
only offices of magi&s;tracy, which affect and pervade every di&s;|trict,
are delegated to the principal inhabitants of the neigh|bourhood,
but there is erected in every county a high and
venerable tribunal, to which owners of permanent property,
down almo&s;t to their lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es, are indi&s;criminately called;
and called to take part, not in the forms and ceremonies of
the meeting, but in the mo&s;t efficient and important of its func|tions.
The wi&s;dom of man hath not devi&s;ed a happier in&s;ti|tution
than that of juries, or one founded in a ju&s;ter knowledge
of human life, or of the human capacity. In juri&s;prudence,
as in every &s;cience, the points ultimately re&s;t upon common
&s;en&s;e. But to reduce a que&s;tion to the&s;e points, and to pro|po&s;e
them accurately, requires not only an under&s;tanding &s;u|perior
to that which is nece&s;&s;ary to decide upon them when
<PB N="19" REF="17">
propo&s;ed, but oftentimes al&s;o a technical and peculiar crudi|tion.
Agreeably to this di&s;tinction, which runs perhaps through
all &s;ciences, what is preliminary and preparatory, is left to the
legal profe&s;&s;ion; what is final, to the plain under&s;tanding of
plain men. But &s;ince it is nece&s;&s;ary that the judgement of
&s;uch men &s;hould be informed; and &s;ince it is of the utmo&s;t
importance that advice, which falls with &s;o much weight, &s;hould
be drawn from the pure&s;t &s;ources; judges are &s;ent down to us,
who have &s;pent their lives in the &s;tudy and admini&s;tration of
the laws of their country, and who come among&s;t us, &s;trangers
to our contentions, if we have any, our parties and our preju|dices;
&s;trangers to every thing, except the evidence which they
hear. The effect corre&s;ponds with the wi&s;dom of the de&s;ign.
Juries may err, and frequently do &s;o; but there is no &s;y&s;tem of
error incorporated with their con&s;titution. Corruption, terror,
influence, are excluded by it; and prejudice, in a great degree,
though not entirely. This danger, which con&s;i&s;ts in juries view|ing
one cla&s;s of men, or one cla&s;s of rights, in a more or le&s;s
favorable light than another, is the only one to be feared, and
to be guarded again&s;t. It is a di&s;po&s;ition, which, whenever it
ri&s;es up in the minds of jurors, ought to be repre&s;&s;ed, by their
probity, their con&s;ciences, the &s;en&s;e of their duty, the remem|brance

and honorable to tho&s;e popular feelings of which all good go|vernments
are tender. Hear the language of the law. In the
mo&s;t momentous intere&s;ts, in the la&s;t peril indeed of human
life, the accu&s;ed appeals to God and his country, "which country
you are." What pomp of titles, what di&s;play of honors, can
equal the real dignity, which the&s;e few words confer upon
tho&s;e to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed? They &s;hew, by terms the
mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;ignificant, how highly the law deems of
the functions and character of a jury: they &s;hew al&s;o, with
what care of the &s;afety of the &s;ubject it is, that the &s;ame law
has provided for every one a recour&s;e to the fair and indiffe|rent
arbitration of his neighbours. This is &s;ub&s;tantial equa|lity;
real freedom: equality of protection; freedom from in|ju&s;tice.
May it never be invaded; never abu&s;ed! May it be
perpetual! And it will be &s;o, if the affection of the country
continue to be pre&s;erved to it, by the integrity of tho&s;e who
are charged with its office.</P>
