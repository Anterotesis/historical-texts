<HEAD>THE
LIFE <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
OF
GILBERT LANGLEY.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Pages contain the Ad|ventures
of <HI>Gilbert Langley,</HI> Gold|&s;mith,
written by his own Pen. It
is conceived, that a liker Picture
cannot well be drawn than that which
he has given us of him&s;elf, it is publi&s;hed chiefly
for the U&s;e of &s;uch as may re&s;emble him in &s;ome
Re&s;pects. Many would fly from Vice if they &s;aw
her Face all at once, and in Day Light; here &s;he is,
never was was &s;he better known to any than to this
Man, and he has &s;ent her abroad in her own Cloaths.
His Stile is the Stile of a Man of Plea&s;ure, and
was not altered, becau&s;e it may be of U&s;e to know
what &s;ort of Stile that is.</P>
<P>Some People may perhaps fancy the reading &s;uch
a Life dangerous, for their Sakes this Adverti&s;e|ment
is prefixed. If they &s;ee young People make
ill U&s;e of it, let them &s;et them right, let them bid
<PB N="4" REF="4">
the&s;e incon&s;iderate Folks make the Growth and
Progre&s;s of Vice, from abu&s;ing Education to cheat|ing
a Father, to defrauding the World, from de|frauding
the World to downright Robbery, and &s;o
to the Gallows; an open broad Road, and his un|happy
Journey makes the Stages for others, that
they &s;top or ride back in Time, according to the
old approved Maxim.
<Q><L>Satius e&s;t recurrere quam currere male.</L>
<LG>
<L>Better return, than in an ill Road run.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>We commonly hear the young Spendthri&s;ts of
our Times, di&s;cour&s;e exactly in Mr. <HI>Langley's</HI> Lan|guage,
and rea&s;on, or rather pervert Rea&s;on as he
does. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, point out a &s;imilar Pa&s;&s;age
in this fine Hi&s;tory of modern Gallantry, and put
him in Mind of the Conclu&s;ion; tell him, which
is a certain Truth, that <HI>Greenwich</HI> Rambles lead to
<HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> Goal, that Intrigues with Pro&s;titutes in
the Plea&s;ure rather of a Goat, than of a Man, and
that the Digre&s;&s;ions from the Paths of Virtue, is
walking for the Air in <HI>Tyburn Road,</HI> where you run
more Hazards than one of Choaking. But to
proceed to his own Account.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert Langley,</HI> elde&s;t Son of <HI>Holdenby Langley,</HI>
an eminent <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and Nephew to
Sir <HI>Thomas Langley,</HI> Bart. was born <HI>Nov.</HI> 19, 1710;
at three Years of Age he was &s;ent down to his
Grandmother's Seat at <HI>Pelder&s;ley</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> un|der
who&s;e Care he continued till he was &s;even
Years of Age, when his Mother growing impa|tient
at his long Continuance in the Country, came
down from <HI>London</HI> to &s;etch him Home. No &s;ooner
<PB N="5" REF="5">
had he received the Vi&s;its common on &s;uch Occa|&s;ions,
and recovered from the Fatigue of his
Journey, but he was put to School to Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>
in <HI>Red-lion-&s;treet,</HI> from who&s;e prudent In&s;tructions
he in his tenders Years made &s;o great an Improve|ment,
that few or none in the &s;ame School were
thought his Equals, and his Father unwilling to
curb the promi&s;ing Genuis of his Child, by the
Advice and Con&s;ent of his Ma&s;ter, removed him
from thence to the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI> and thereby
gave him a further Opportunity of exerting his na|tural
Parts. Here in a &s;hort Time he began to
read <HI>Virgil, Ovid, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> and
had as great Knowledge of tho&s;e Authors as his
tender Years would admit. But &s;uch is the Mi&s;|fortune
of &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schools, that the
Ma&s;ters, either to plea&s;e the Parents, or indulge
the Child, hurry their Pupils, from Cla&s;s to Cla&s;s
without con&s;ulting whether they are &s;ufficiently
grounded in the fir&s;t Rudiments of Learning,
Hence it is, that &s;o many Youths who have ran
through all the Cla&s;&s;ic Authors, after a Year or
two's Ab&s;ence from School, are almo&s;t as far to
&s;eek, as if their Parents had not expended any
Thing on their Education.</P>
<P><HI>Gilbert's</HI> Father being &s;ully per&s;uaded of this al|mo&s;t
univer&s;al Error and Corruption in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Schools, re&s;olved to &s;end him over to the Bene|dictine
Monks at <HI>Doway</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> there to have
him brought up in his own Religion; but not|with&s;tanding
the great Di&s;parity between a Foreign
and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Education, was &s;o fully proved by &s;e|veral
of Mr. <HI>Langley's</HI> Friends, yet his Wife could
not by Arguments, be induced to a Compliance in
<PB N="6" REF="6">
parting with her Child, preferring rather the Pre|&s;ence
of her Son in Ignorance, before his Ab&s;ence,
in a Place where he was &s;ure to have the faire&s;t Op|portunity
of acquiring &s;olid and u&s;eful Learning.
Thus her Fondne&s;s triumph'd over her Rea&s;on,
and &s;he could not bear the Thoughts of a Separa|tion
from her Darling, who to plea&s;e her, though
to his own Prejudice, was continued at Home, till
Providence, was plea&s;ed to take her away, and by
that removed the &s;ole Ob&s;tacle to the intended Pro|gre&s;s
of our young Student; for no &s;ooner was
his too-fond Mamma dead, and decently interred,
but the Father, earne&s;tly bent on his Son's Ad|vancement,
made diligent Search for a proper Per|&s;on,
to whom he might commit the Tru&s;t of his
Son, until he &s;hould arrive at <HI>Doway,</HI> the Place
de&s;igned for his future Education. Upon Enqui|ry,
he found out Mr. <HI>Sturton,</HI> the Prior of the
<HI>Benedictine Monks,</HI> who being come to <HI>London</HI> a|bout
&s;ome particular Bu&s;ine&s;s, was now returning
to his Convent; with this Gentleman he agreed on
an annual Sum for my Board, Learning, and all
other nece&s;&s;ary Expences, and it was agreed my
Departure was to be as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The Day
been fixed, we met at the <HI>Cro&s;s-Keys,</HI> in <HI>Grace|church-Street,</HI>
where my indulgent Father, with
reiterated Entreaties, &s;ollicited Mr. <HI>Sturton,</HI> to a
peculiar Care of his young Pupil, and after he had
tenderly embraced me, with flowing Eyes, com|mitted
me to the Management of my new Tutor.
For my Part, I readily con&s;e&s;s, that being fond
of Novelty, and having a roving Di&s;po&s;ition, I
was rather plea&s;ed than concerned at our Parting,
and with Joy re&s;igned my&s;elf to a new &s;trange
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Guardian. In &s;hort, we lay at the Inn that Eight,
and in the Morning took Coach for <HI>Dover,</HI> from
whence (the Packet being ready to Sail) we em|barked
for Calais, and in a fw Hours, with a fre&s;h
and favourable Gale, we reached the wi&s;hed-for
Haven. My Tutor being intimately acquainted
with Mr. <HI>Francia,</HI> (commonly known in <HI>England</HI>
by the Name of <HI>Francia</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI>) we lodged in his
Hou&s;e, and were civilly and agreeably entertained
by him for the Space of three Days.</P>
<P>Now all Things appear'd to me very uncom|mon,
and being unable to under&s;tand the Native
Language, Manners, or Cu&s;toms, I thought my|&s;elf
in a New World, a&s;king &s;everal impertinent
Que&s;tions of my Guardian, who well plea&s;ed with
my Curio&s;ity, and juvenile Ob&s;ervations, gave me
&s;uch An&s;wers as my tender Age was capable to
under&s;tand. Now after Thanks to Mr. <HI>Francia</HI>
for his kind Entertainment, we proceeded on our
Journey, and the next Day arrived at St. <HI>Omers,</HI>
where we &s;pent the whole Day viewing the Curio|&s;ities
of that Town, which I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to
de&s;cribe, being then but in the 12th Year of my
Age; yet I cannot forbear taking Notice of the
Cathedral of St. <HI>Bartin</HI>'s, an ancient and &s;tately
Structure, adorned with &s;everal curious Pieces of
Painting, and embelli&s;hed with numerous Orna|ments;
but what &s;truck me mo&s;t with Wonder
and Surprize, were the Skins of a Toad and a
Crocodile, each of an enormous Size, that were
fixed to one of the Columns of the Church; but
&s;ince there are &s;o many various Reports, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o|mantick
Fables devi&s;ed by the Populace concern|ing
the prodigious Dimen&s;ions of tho&s;e Animals,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
and the Manner of their being di&s;covered, I &s;hall
omit troubling my Reader any farther on that
Head, &s;ince where I cannot give a full, true, and
&s;atisfactory Account, my Re&s;olution is to be
&s;ilent.</P>
<P>Adjoining to this noble Cathedral, is a magni|ficent
and &s;plendid Convent, re&s;embling more the
Palace of a grand Monarch, than the Receptacle
of Per&s;ons, who under the &s;pacious Pretence of
Religion retire thither; although in Reality, they
much more fully iudulge their irregular Pa&s;&s;ions and
inordinate De&s;ires, than tho&s;e who &s;truggling in
the tempe&s;tuous Ocean of the World, boldly ex|po&s;e
them&s;elves to all Dangers, and to the utmo&s;t
of their Abilities, &s;erve and glorify their great
Creator&punc; In this Convent are upwards of 150 Je|&s;uits,
and near 100 Students, who all pay the an|nual
Salary of 25<HI>l.</HI> Sterling, except twelve of
them, who are upon the Pope's Foundation. My
Guardian and I paid a Vi&s;it to the Prior, who en|tertained
us in a &s;umptuous and elegant Manner,
none being &s;o profu&s;e in their Entertainments as
the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Clergy one among another. The next
Morning we &s;et out for <HI>Doway,</HI> where we arrived
in the Evening, to the great Satisfaction and Com|fort
of the <HI>Benedictines,</HI> who with all po&s;&s;ible De|mon&s;trations
of Joy, received their Superior, and
(as I was afterwards informed) highly applauded
him for the due Execution of his Commi&s;&s;ion, and
commended his Diligence and unwearied Endea|vours,
in encrea&s;ing the Number of the Faithful.
At the Expiration of three Days, which are u&s;u|ally
allowed to young Sparks, to initiate them&s;elves
in the Forms and Precepts of the College, I was
<PB N="9" REF="9">
examined by three Reverend Fathers, and upon a
&s;trict Examination, was found capable of nothing
higher than <HI>Alvarus's</HI> Grammar, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Com|mentaries,
a plain Proof of the Vanity of &s;ome of
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schools. But &s;ince my Readers may
be curious, and willing to be informed of the Man|ners
and Cu&s;toms of our Collegiate Life, I &s;hall
for their Satisfaction give a true Account thereof.
The annual Salary is 25<HI>l.</HI> Sterling for an elder
Brother, and 20 ditto for a younger; at our fir&s;t
Entrance we are dive&s;ted of our &s;ecular Garb, and
cloathed with a Ca&s;&s;ock and a Gown, re&s;embling
in Form tho&s;e of the Foundation of the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI>
which Dre&s;s, according to the ancient
Rules of the Hou&s;e, is allowed to each Student
new every Year. The Scholars are divided accord|ing
to their different Abilities and Capacities into
&s;everal Cla&s;&s;es, each apart, to prevent Noi&s;e and
Interruption, and over each Cla&s;s pre&s;ides a pro|per
Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to in&s;truct his Pupils
in the Knowledge of &s;uch Authors as he thinks
mo&s;t proper and &s;uitable to their Genius and Un|der&s;tanding.
We were obliged to continue twelve
Months in the &s;ame Study, that we may be entire|ly
perfect therein, and during that Time, have
Monthly Examinations, in which the mo&s;t perfect
is for his Encouragement to receive a Praemium
from the Hands of the Prior, at the three &s;everal
grand Examinations, that are held before the whole
Hou&s;e; at <HI>Ea&s;ter, Michaelmas,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> All
(except tho&s;e who are in the <HI>Accidence</HI>) are com|pell'd
at all Times, and on all Occa&s;ions to &s;peak
the Latin Tongue. We have a large Dormitory,
where each Student has a Bed a-part, a Cale-facto|ry,
<PB N="10" REF="10">
and at each End thereof, a large fire Place,
though but &s;mall Allowance of Wood, having but
one Faggot, and two Billets to each Fire, and that
only in the Evening, which cau&s;es &s;ome of our
young Sparks, &s;ometimes privately, and &s;ometimes
by open Force, to break into the Wood-hou&s;e,
that &s;tands in our Area or Yard. Our Refectory
or Dining-Room, is large and commodious, and
&s;erved with due Oeconomy, where each Scholar
has the fir&s;t Choice of the Portions of Meat, ac|cording
to his Superiority in Learning. Our Diet
is Bread and Butter every Morning, at Noon half
a Pound of boil'd Meat, with a Porringer of Broth,
and at Night, the &s;ame Allowance of Roa&s;t, with
a Sallad, except on Fa&s;ts; but at Meals, we have
as much Bread and Beer as we de&s;ire, although at
all other Times, we are debarr'd even from a cru&s;t
of Bread, or a Draught of Beer, which makes us
Frequently convey out the &s;ame under our Ca&s;&s;ocks,
and &s;ometimes like ravenous Wolves, make bold
Incur&s;ions into the Kitchen, and there plunder and
carry away all that we can meet with; but of this
more hereafter. Over the Students, which are
never le&s;s than fifty or three&s;core, a Prefect is ap|pointed
by the Prior, who ought to be a Per&s;on of
great Sagacity and Di&s;cretion, for to his Care the
Direction of all the Scholars (when out of their re|&s;pective
Schools) is committed; he hears all De|bates,
&s;ettles all Controver&s;ies, and appea&s;es all
Quarrels that ari&s;e among&s;t his Pupils; his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
is to call them at five in the Morning, as well
in Winter as Summer, he rings the Bell to Prayers,
at their Meals &s;ays Grace, and orders one of the
Scholars in his Turn to mount the Pulpit, and
<PB N="11" REF="11">
read the Martyrology, during the Time of Repa&s;t,
whil&s;t he him&s;elf &s;tands at the upper End of the
Refectory to keep Silence, and prevent any Con|fu&s;ion
or Irregularities, that might otherwi&s;e hap|pen
among &s;uch Boys. Hours of Study are from
Five till half an Hour after Seven, the other half
Hour being allowed for wa&s;hing and breakfa&s;t
Time; at Eight we go to School, at Eleven to
Prayers, at Noon to Dinner, at One to Study, at
Two to School, at half an Hour after Four to
Play, at Five to Study, at Six to Supper, and
afterwards to play if in the Summer Time, or in
the Winter to our re&s;pective Seats in the Calefac|tory.
None dares pre&s;ume to go into the Town
without the Prefect's Leave; we have a capacious
Area or Yard, wherein is a Terras Walk, and a
Place very proper for the Exerci&s;e of Hand-Ball,
in which we &s;trove to &s;urpa&s;s each other.</P>
<P>At <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> the Scholars are allowed to chu&s;e
a King to promote Pa&s;time, and all the great Of|ficers
of his Court; which occa&s;ions a great deal
of Diver&s;ion. On Twelfth Night, the King &s;ends
his Amba&s;&s;adors to invite the Prior, and &s;ome of
the Grandees of the Hou&s;e, to an elegant and
co&s;tly Supper, to which none except the great
Officers of State, are admitted; all the re&s;t being
then in waiting, and receive, as his Maje&s;ty's
Bounty, what comes from his Royal Table. For
my Readers Satisfaction, I &s;hall mention an odd
Accident that happened to me, whil&s;t I had the
Honour of &s;erving in Quality of an Amba&s;&s;a|dor.</P>
<P>On the Eve of the Epiphany, I received an Order
to take three of the Lords of the Bed-chamber, and
<PB N="12" REF="12">
go about two Miles out of Town to a Publick-hou&s;e,
and there to purcha&s;e four Gallons of Brandy for the
abovementioned Entertainment. As I could &s;peak the
<HI>French</HI> Language, I &s;oon executed the Commi&s;&s;ion, at
a far more rea&s;onable Rate than I could po&s;&s;ibly have
done in the Town, there being a large Duty on the
Import of any Spirituous Liquors into the Garri&s;on,
and that farm'd by a <HI>Comis,</HI> or Officer, that hath his
Myrmidons con&s;tantly attending at the Entrance of
the Town Gate, who &s;earch all comers in; but it be|ing
u&s;ual to let the Students of different Colleges pa&s;s
and repa&s;s, without Hindrance or Examination, we
thought our&s;elves &s;ecure from any Danger that might
ari&s;e on that Head; &s;o after our Bottles were filled,
we &s;at down in the Hou&s;e, and drank a Gla&s;s or two
to refre&s;h our&s;elves; but, as ill Fortune would have
it, a Soldier coming into the &s;ame Hou&s;e, privately
took Notice of our Bottles that &s;tood on the Table,
and went to the Searcher's Office, and gave Informa|tion
that four Students of the Benedictine Monks,
were going to convey Brandy into the Garri&s;on. We
were entirely ignorant of the private Information that
he had given, and therefore in a merry Mind, paid
the Reckoning, and returned homeward with the Li|quor
under our Ca&s;&s;ocks, when, to our great Surprize,
as we were going in at the Gate, we were &s;topped,
the Brandy found upon us, and we &s;ecured in the ad|joining
Office, till they had called a File of Mu&s;que|teers
to conduct us to the head Comis's Hou&s;e for fur|ther
Examination. I had then a Pi&s;tole in my
Pocket, and knowing the mighty Force of Gold, of|fered
it to the Searchers for our Enlargement; but
they were inflexible, and therefore any one may judge,
what Horror and Confu&s;ion we were in, at the ap|proaching
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Danger. In &s;hort, as we marched along
with the Guard of Soldiers, the Inhabitants won|dered
what Crime &s;uch Youths could be guilty of, that
had thus expo&s;ed them to publick Scandal and Shame.
Some pitied our Misfortune, and others condemned our
Folly, but by a lucky Accident, we met with two <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Franci&s;can Fryers, who enquiring of the Serjeant the
Cau&s;e of this unu&s;al Treatment, reprimanded him &s;e|verely
for his Folly, in carrying us to the Officer of
the Cu&s;toms, and at the &s;ame Time advi&s;ed him to
conduct us to our own College, and inform the Prior
of what had happened, it being properly his Bu&s;ine&s;s
to an&s;wer for the Mi&s;demeanors and Trepa&s;&s;es of all
Students under his immediate Care and Direction.
This &s;age Advice of the Fathers, prevailed on the
rigid Officer, who conveyed us &s;afe to our own Convent
and a&s;terwards made his Report to the abovemention'd
Officer, who next Morning &s;ent to demand four hun|dred
Florins of the Prior, the u&s;ual Forfeiture, or
Fine impo&s;ed for the infringement of his Dues and
Privileges. Our Prior was &s;tartled at this exorbi|tant
Demand, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give the lea&s;t
Satisfaction, which &s;o exa&s;perated the Comis, that he
re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute us with the utmo&s;t Rigour.
Hereupon the Prior con&s;ulting the Sages of the Law,
was advi&s;ed to quiet the impending Storm, and
bring this unlucky Accident to an amicable Compo&s;i|tion,
which was accordingly effected on the Payment
of one hundred Florins, and a further Promi&s;e that
none of his Pupils &s;hould ever be guilty of the like
Offence.</P>
<P>The <HI>March</HI> following, another Misfortune hap|pened
to me that had likely to have proved fatal,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and of greater Con&s;equence than the former,
which was as follows:</P>
<P><HI>John Hu&s;&s;ey, William Etherington, George
Pigot, John Racket, William Brown, and my|&s;elf,</HI>
formed a Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Peace of the
Common-wealth, and by a mutual and &s;olemn Engage|ment,
were fully determined to make an Irruption in|to
the Kitchen, and there plunder all that we could
meet with. The Night before the Execution of our
Plot, we, by the Help of Gimblets, had &s;ecretly bored
two Holes in the Kitchen Door, that leads to the Re|fectory,
and fixed two Pieces of Packthread, blacked
on purpo&s;e to prevent their being ob&s;erved, to the
Bolts that fa&s;tened the Door on the In&s;ide; this
Scheme, though artfully managed, was perceived by
one of the Scullions, who immediately gave Notice
thereof, to the re&s;t of the Servants, who judging our
Intent, armed them&s;elves with Bludgeons, and re&s;olv'd
to di&s;pute the Entrance into their &s;ooty Kingdom a|gain&s;t
all Invaders. They likewi&s;e furni&s;hed them|&s;elves
with a dark Lanthorn, either to de&s;cry the
Number of the A&s;&s;ailants, and loudy complain again&s;t
&s;uch publick Acts of Rapine and Ho&s;tility. No le&s;s
diligent were we to execute our Intent, and having pro|vided
our&s;elves with lu&s;ty Cudgels, and a Chi&s;&s;el to
open the Refectory Door, between the Hours of twelve
and One, we began to attack the Garri&s;on; fir&s;t with
little or no Noi&s;e, forced open the Door, and gained
an ea&s;y Entrance into the Kitchen Pa&s;&s;age by the Help
of tho&s;e Cords we had fa&s;tened to the Bolts of the
&s;aid Door that guarded the Entrance. We now
thought our&s;elves &s;ecure, and found in the &s;aid inlett
into our intended Port, two large Barrels of Rai&s;ins,
with the Heads of them open; this unexpected Prize
<PB N="15" REF="15">
overjoyed us, and we immediately fell to plunder, and
filled a large &s;ack that we had brought with us,
to carry away our Booty; but to our great A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
we were &s;uddenly &s;aluted with repeated Blows
on our Heads, Backs, and Shoulders, from different
Quarters laid heavily on us, by the numerous company
of Servants, that were fully bent to retrieve their lo&s;t
Reputation, and make us Pri&s;oners of War. We
&s;traitway quitted our Prize, and fell Pell-mell on the
Enemy, with true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> courage, and Bravery,
and returned their blows &s;o bri&s;kly, that they began
to give Ground, which &s;o redoubled our Ardour, that
we drove them out of their Fortifications, into the
open Garden, belonging to the Religious; where find|ing
them&s;elves unable to with&s;tand our Fury, they
immediately &s;et up a great cry, calling out, <HI>Laroon,</HI>
<HI>Laroon,</HI> which is in Engli&s;h, Thieves, Thieves, and
the <HI>Shoemaker,</HI> who was one of the Gang, &s;tretching
forth his dark Lanthorn, looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on us;
whereupon <HI>Hu&s;&s;ey</HI> knocked it out of his Hand, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
too late, for he already knew us, and their Out-cry
by this Time having alarmed the Hou&s;e, we were
obliged to make a precipitate Retreat, and endeavour
to regain our Quarters before the Perfect's Arrival,
which was happily effected, and we all in our re&s;pec|tive
Beds, pretending to be fa&s;t a&s;leep; but this Arti|fice
would not pa&s;s on him, for we not having Time to
Undre&s;s, our Ca&s;&s;ocks were not as u&s;ual &s;pread over
our Bed-cloaths, and he thereby ea&s;ily di&s;covered
us.</P>
<P>The next Morning we were &s;ummoned before the
Grand Prior, where the poor battered and brui&s;ed
&s;ervants made a mo&s;t pitious complaint of their bar|barous
Treatment, vowing that they would all leave
<PB N="16" REF="16">
the Hou&s;e, except they had ample Satisfaction for the
Injury done them. The Prior taking this Affair into
his con&s;ideration, rightly judged, that if he counte|nanced
&s;nch open Acts of Theft and Ho&s;tility, that
none would ever &s;erve in the Convent, and that it
va&s;tly derogated from his character, who&s;e Office was
to maintain Peace and good Tranquility throughout
his Juri&s;diction, and therefore he pronounced this har&s;h,
tho' ju&s;t &s;entence, that we &s;hould for this unparallel'd
crime, be expelled the college, as an Example to deter
others from the like notorious Offence. We were now
like criminals under Sentence of Death, none caring to
conver&s;e with us, lea&s;t they &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to be
infected with our wicked and perver&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions.
However, as Mercy is &s;ometimes extended to the mo&s;t
abandoned Wretches, we all (except <HI>Brown</HI>) by great
Itnere&s;t, and the characters our Ma&s;ters gave of our
being Youths of a promi&s;ing Genius, were reprieved,
and once more on promi&s;e of our future good behavi|our,
again admitted into Favour. Notwith&s;tanding
this unexpected clemency, we could not &s;uppre&s;s our
Re&s;entment, at the Expul&s;ion of our old confederate
<HI>Brown,</HI> but vowed to revenge the Injury and Inju&s;tice
that we thought was done to our former companion,
in the mo&s;t &s;ecret Manner that po&s;&s;ibly we could; and
therefore we had frequent Debates and con&s;ultations
how to bring about our intended Project. At la&s;t,
the following Method was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved on.
In our Area &s;tands the Wood-hou&s;e, to which the
Scullion (the Informer of our fir&s;t Attack) u&s;ually came
every Day with a Wheelbarrow to fetch Wood, be|tween
the Hours of four and five in the Afternoon,
for the U&s;e of the Kitchen. We therefore provided
our&s;elves with a cloak belonging to one of the minor
<PB N="17" REF="17">
Students to prevent Su&s;picion, ready again&s;t his
Entrance, to &s;urprize him in the following Man|ner.</P>
<P>There was a Ladder &s;tanding in the Yard, by
the Help of which, we privately got in at the
Window, and hid our&s;elves behind the Faggots,
and there with Impatience waited his coming, hav|ing,
in the mean Time, well provided our&s;elves
with &s;mart Switches, to la&s;h the bare Bumb of our
inveterate Enemy. No &s;ooner had he opened the
Door, and began to load his Barrow, but the
Cloak was thrown over his Head, and fa&s;tened with
a Cord round his Neck, &s;o that being blinded, he
was uncapable to di&s;cover who was the Foe, or
make any Defence to prevent his intended Puni&s;h|ment.
In &s;hort, we fir&s;t &s;hut the Door, to prevent
his Cries being heard, then knocked him down, let
down his Breeches, and paid his bare Buttocks in
Turns, 'till we were all weary&punc; Nor were his hide|ous
Cries, or loud Invocations of his Tutelar
Saints, able to abate our Rage, or defend him
from the &s;evere Puni&s;hment, that we were in Ho|nour
bound to inflict on this Delinquent, as a Re|taliation,
and Satisfaction for the Di&s;grace of our
former Companion. No &s;ooner was this bloody
Flagellation, or Scourging ended, but the Bell
rang to Study, and we left the poor unhappy
Wretch alone to bemoan his dire Misfortune, and
vainly vonjecture who were the Per&s;ons who had
thus irreverently prophaned their Characters, and
went in a decent Manner to the <HI>Mu&s;aeum,</HI> where we
took our re&s;pective Seats, as innocently in Appear|ance,
as if nothing had happened, though well
plea&s;ed in our Conceits at the good Succe&s;s of
<PB N="18" REF="18">
what we had &s;o long and &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for.
The Scullion had no &s;ooner freed him&s;elf from his
Hood-wink, and recovered his lo&s;t Sight, but he
ran crying out, <HI>le Diable, le Diable,</HI> with the utmo&s;t
Speed into the Kitchen, and there after having re|covered
his Breath, recounted the di&s;mal Story to
his Fellow-Servants, who were all amazed, and
&s;orely affrighted le&s;t the &s;ame Devils &s;hould unex|pectedly
&s;urprize and puni&s;h them for the &s;aid Of|fence.
However, when the pannic Fear and Ter|ror
they were in, was &s;omething abated, they in a
whole Po&s;&s;e, with the injured Party at their Head,
went to the Prior, and loudly exclaimed again&s;t
the In&s;ult and barbarous Treatment of their Coun|tryman,
by tho&s;e <HI>Bougre de Chiens,</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Dogs,</HI>
as they were plea&s;ed to call us, his Students. The
Prior calmly heard their ju&s;t Accu&s;ation, and faith|fully
promi&s;ed them, in <HI>Verbo Sacerdotis,</HI> to redre&s;s
their Grievances, and inflict condign Puni&s;hment
on tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;ound guilty of this vil|lainous
and unpardonable Act of Cruelty. Accord|ingly
he came into the <HI>Mu&s;aeum,</HI> and ca&s;t a piercing
and ob&s;ervant Look over all the Scholars, hoping
thereby to di&s;cern by their Countenances, who
were the guilty Per&s;ons; but as the mo&s;t &s;agacious
and cunning, are &s;ometimes deceived, &s;o was he.
All his Artifices proved ineffectual, and therefore,
he with Rea&s;on good, as we were formerly prov'd
guilty of a Mi&s;demeanor, po&s;itively charged us
with the Fact, and called us one by one, into a
private Room, for further Examination; but we,
who were alway true to each other, ab&s;olutely de|nied
that we either directly or indirectly, were
privy to, or knew any Thing of what we were
<PB N="19" REF="19">
thus charged with: And I, for my Part, to clear
my&s;elf and Co-partners in the Crime, &s;wore by the
Holy Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that then &s;tood on a Table,
in the Room, that we were no ways acce&s;&s;ary, or
concerned in the Commi&s;&s;ion of this horrid Vil|lainy,
and in Confirmation thereof on bended
Knees, ki&s;&s;ed and embraced the &s;ame. This &s;o|lemn
Prote&s;tation had its de&s;ired Effect, and the
Prior being thoroughly &s;atisfied with this frank and
unprecedented Manner of acquitting our&s;elves, af|terwards
treated us with more than u&s;ual Marks of
his Civility and E&s;teem. Nor was it ever known
during my Stay in the College, who were the Au|thors
of the abovementioned Riot,</P>
<P>Affairs being thus happily accommodated, all
Things &s;eemed to bear the chearful Air of Joy,
Peace and Tranquility, and I plyed my Studies &s;o
very diligently, that for the two following Years,
I had the Honour to receive the annual Praemiums,
given for the Encouragement of the indu&s;trious
Student. Now the Eyes of the whole Synod
was fix'd on me, of whom they had great Hopes,
if they could by any Means or Arguments induce
me, to relinqui&s;h all Thoughts of a gay and &s;e|cular
Life, and embrace a religious Mona&s;tical
State, and to accompli&s;h this their De&s;ign, they
treated me in a Manner different from that u&s;ed
towards the re&s;t of my Contemporaries, and by
their artful and engaging Behaviour ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded
me to promi&s;e that, with my Father's Con&s;ent and Approbation, I would accept of the Habit,
and add one more to the Number of the Faithful.
But mark how Providence, by an unexpected and
unfore&s;een Accident, &s;ubverted and fru&s;trated wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="20" REF="20">
they with &s;o much Art had endeavoured to obtain.
As by the Benevolence, and kind Indulgence of
my Father, I was con&s;tantly &s;upplied with Money,
I frequently went into the Town, partly for my
Recreation, and partly to improve my&s;elf in the
French Language, which I was very de&s;irous to
become Ma&s;ter of, and therefore one <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> in
the Afternoon, which is always a Holyday with
us, I a&s;ked Leave of the Prefect for me and my
Companion, <HI>Roger Meynel,</HI> to go out and walk
on the Ramparts. The Prefect being vexed at
&s;ome Di&s;appointment or other, was in a &s;ullen
moro&s;e Humour, and there&s;ore denied our Re|que&s;t.
Exa&s;perated at this unexpected Denial,
we determined <HI>Nolens Volens</HI> to accompli&s;h our
Intent, and thus re&s;olved, we boldly went out at
the Convent-Gate, into the Town, and from
thence to a Tavern, where we gave a loo&s;e to
Plea&s;ure and revelled at large, till we were weary
and intoxicated with Liquor, and then to &s;ober
our&s;elves we &s;tagger'd about an Hour on the
Ramparts; not unob&s;erved by many, and from
thence we reel'd Home, but had the Wit to &s;teal
privately to Bed: When the Bell rang to Supper,
we being mi&s;&s;ing, were enquired for; however,
An&s;wer was made by &s;ome of our Friends, that
we were taken ill and gone to Bed. This Excu&s;e
pa&s;s'd for two or three Days, till a Gentleman who
knew us, came to vi&s;it the Prior, and informed
him in what a &s;candalous, fooli&s;h Condition we
had been ob&s;erved on the publick Ramparts, which
&s;o highly incens'd our Governor, that after &s;everal
Reprimands, he ordered us both to be &s;martly
&s;logg'd. I was then in Poetry, and therefore was
<PB N="21" REF="21">
&s;o highly exa&s;perated at this In&s;ult, that I re&s;olved
to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of any further Progre&s;s in
my Learning, and therefore betook my&s;elf to a
&s;ullen and continued Silence, which I &s;trictly ob|&s;erved
for near a Month, and no Per&s;ua&s;ions were
able to alter my perver&s;e Di&s;po&s;ition, till Father
<HI>Howard</HI> took me to ta&s;k, and by his winning Af|fability,
prevail'd on my &s;ullen Temper. This
Gentleman indulged me with the free U&s;e of his
Chamber, where I &s;pent my lei&s;ure Hours with
the umto&s;t Plea&s;ure in the Peru&s;al of his Books,
and was highly delighted with his ingenious Re|marks
and Ob&s;ervations, on &s;uch Authors as be&s;t
&s;uited my Genius, and heightened the natural Con|ceptions
of my growing Capacity. Thus having
relinqui&s;hed all De&s;ires of coming to England, I
clo&s;ely followed my Studies, and having ran
through all the Cla&s;&s;icks, I proceeded to Philo|&s;ophy,
pa&s;s'd through my Dialect of Logick, and
was ju&s;t entring upon a Cour&s;e of Metaphy&s;icks,
when an Order came for my immediate return
Home.</P>
<P>This unexpected News greatly &s;urprized the
whole Hou&s;e, and the Prior with my Con&s;ent
wrote to my Father, in the mo&s;t moving Terms,
urg'd the future Advantage I &s;hould reap by a full
Conclu&s;ion of what I had &s;o happily began; but
all his Endeavours were in vain, for the old Gen|tleman
remained inflexible, and once more &s;ent a
po&s;itive Order for my Removal, and al&s;o for five
Guineas for my Return Home. Thus having
bid adieu, and taken my la&s;t Farewell of the Re|ligious,
and all my Fellow-Students, with Tears
in my Eyes, I took Coach to St. <HI>Omers.</HI> We had
<PB N="22" REF="22">
not drove above a Mile or two out of Town, but
my gloomy Melancholy was di&s;pers'd and di&s;&s;ipat|ed,
by the Sprightline&s;s and Alacrity of my Fellow-Travellers,
con&s;i&s;ting of two <HI>French</HI> Officers and
three Ladies. The Thoughts of a College Life,
were now turned into Gaiety and Plea&s;ure, and I
was emulous to out&s;hine the Officers in Point of
Complai&s;ance to my fair female Companions. At
Night we arrived at St. <HI>Omers,</HI> where we had an
elegant Supper, and &s;pent the Evening with the
utmo&s;t Mirth and Delight. The Ladies being
excu&s;ed from any Part in the Reckoning, accord|ing
to the Cu&s;tom of <HI>France.</HI> From thence I took
Po&s;t to <HI>Calais,</HI> and lodged at the Sign of the <HI>Ville
des Londres</HI> (or the City of <HI>London</HI>) where I met
with &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen and Ladies that
were waiting a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>England.</HI> Next Day hav|ing
a Letter of Recommendation to my old Friend
Mr. <HI>Francia,</HI> I went and din'd with him, who ge|nerou&s;ly
offered me the free U&s;e of his Hou&s;e dur|ing
my &s;tay at <HI>Calais</HI>; but plea&s;ed with the Va|riety
of diverting Company at my Inn, I mode&s;tly
declined his courteous Offer, becau&s;e thereby I
had a greater Freedom of indulging my juvenile
Follies and Extravagancies. The Wind continuing
<HI>N. W.</HI> for near three Weeks, no Ve&s;&s;el could &s;tir
out of the Harbour, wherefore my Money being
almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by this unexpected Delay, I was
obliged to make Proof of Mr. <HI>Francia's</HI> Friend|&s;hip,
who procured me a Pa&s;&s;age on board the
<HI>Mary</HI> Sloop, Capt. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> who quartered at the
&s;ame Inn with me and the re&s;t of the Company,
who were all his Pa&s;&s;engers. At la&s;t the Wind
chopping about to the Southward, we all embark'd,
<PB N="23" REF="23">
ca&s;t of from the Key, and had a plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age
to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where we went a&s;hore, and &s;upped at
the <HI>Faulcon</HI> Tavern and drank plentifully; but
here I confe&s;s I &s;at on Thorns, for having expend|ed
all my Money, I was at a great Lo&s;s how to
di&s;charge my Share of the Reckoning. At la&s;t I
a&s;&s;umed an Air of Boldne&s;s, and putting my Hand
in my Pocket, a&s;ked the Gentleman that &s;at next
to me, if he would favour me with Change of a
Pi&s;tole, telling him that I had no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coin;
the Gentleman replied, Sir, a Crown is at your Ser|vice.
I humbly thank'd him and readily accepted
the plea&s;ing Proffer, which was &s;ufficient to di&s;|charge
my Dividend of the Reckoning; highly
delighted at my good Luck, and the generous
Treatment of a Stranger.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we arrived at <HI>Tower-&s;tairs,</HI> and having
returned many Thanks to the abovementioned
Gentleman, and gave him Directions where my
Father liv'd, I took my leave of the re&s;t of the
Company, went a&s;hore, and call'd a Coach, and
order'd him to drive to <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</HI> My
Father was &s;tanding at his Door, but &s;carcely knew
me, habited like a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and dre&s;&s;ed <HI>Ala|mode
de Paris,</HI> till at la&s;t recovering him&s;elf from
his Surprize, he took me into the Parlour and
there tenderly embraced me. Numbers of the
Neighbours came to compliment me on my &s;afe
return Home. Sometime after I had refre&s;hed my|&s;elf,
the good old Gentleman a&s;ked me, what
Cour&s;e of Life I was willing to embrace, for my
future Support and Maintenance. I propo&s;ed the
Study of the Law, or Phy&s;ic, both which the re|jected,
<PB N="24" REF="24">
and I at la&s;t by his earne&s;t Sollicitations,
was bound Apprentice to him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Gilpin,</HI> (my Fellow Apprentice)
having then about one Year and a half to &s;erve, my
Father made u&s;e of this Opportunity, of giving
me a further Education, and more &s;uitable for the
Tran&s;action of Public Bu&s;ine&s;s than the former,
and therefore he &s;ent me to Mr. <HI>Yeate</HI>'s Academy,
in <HI>Chancery-Lane,</HI> there to be perfect in Arithme|tic.
He likewi&s;e provided me a <HI>French</HI> Ma&s;ter,
who daily came to in&s;truct me in the Theory of
that u&s;eful Language, of which before I had no|thing
but the practick Part. In the Evening, I
went to a <HI>German</HI> Limner, in <HI>Craven-Buildings,</HI>
there to learn that noble and ingenious Science of
Drawing, &s;o va&s;tly beneficial in all the Stages of
human Life. Thus for a con&s;iderable Time, my
Thoughts were wholly intent on the Pur&s;uit of the
abovementioned Accompli&s;hments; till by Degrees
falling into Company with &s;ome other gay Sparks&punc;
I grew weary of my habitual Exerci&s;es, and &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

of the Town; this Nymph, &s;o &s;truck me at
the fir&s;t Sight, that I re&s;olved at all Events to fol|low
her Home, which as it happened was not far
off that Part of the Town, being the u&s;ual Re&s;i|dence
for tho&s;e of her Stamp. In &s;hort, &s;eeing her
go into a Hou&s;e, I thought my&s;elf &s;ecure, and
went to a neighbouring Publican's, where calling
for a Quartern of Brandy, by the De&s;cription of
my fair Charmer, I &s;oon found that that was the
u&s;ual Place of her Re&s;idence and Abode. How|ever,
having then a Charge of Plate, and being in
a Di&s;hable, I dur&s;t not pre&s;ume to gratify my ar|dent
De&s;ires with my fair <HI>Phillis</HI> for the pre&s;ent,
but re&s;olved at all Events to vi&s;it her, the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, and therefore I di&s;charged my Tru&s;t
and went Home. Her lovely Form, filled my
Soul, and therefore all my earne&s;t Care and Study
was, how to rai&s;e Money &s;ufficient to indulge and
gratify my eager Wi&s;hes in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e
Charms, with which I was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately enamour'd.
Now Fortune, by the following unexpected Ac|cident,
gave me an Opportunity to furni&s;h my&s;elf
with a Sufficiency to execute my amorous Exploit.
My Father according to Cu&s;tom, being gone to
&s;moak a Pipe after Dinner, I was left alone in the
Shop, and knowing that he would not return in
le&s;s than an Hour, I thought this a proper Time to
execute my intended Project; then going to his
De&s;k, to my great Joy and Surprize found the
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Key in it, and willingly embracing this favourable
Opportunity, opened the De&s;k, and took &s;even
Guineas out of the three &s;everal Bags, lea&s;t that
Sum, if taken out of one, &s;hould be mi&s;&s;ed, and
I &s;u&s;pected of the Fraud. No &s;ooner had I put
the Money in my Pocket, but I called up the
Maid to look after the Shop, whil&s;t I went back|wards
and hid the Money, lea&s;t perchance I &s;hould
be di&s;covered, and the Ca&s;h found upon me. But
the old Gentleman who never kept any regular
Account thereof, never mi&s;&s;ed it, and I the <HI>Sunday</HI>
following, having dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the be&s;t Ad|vantage,
put three Guineas of my &s;tolen Trea&s;ure
into my Pocket, and about three in the Afternoon
went to vi&s;it my lovely Godde&s;s. Her Apartment
was up one-Pair-of-Stairs, well furni&s;hed, her At|tendant
an old &s;uperannuated Curtezan, worn out
in the Wars of <HI>Venus,</HI> who in a &s;nuffling Tone,
a&s;ked me what I would plea&s;e to have? I bri&s;kly
reply'd, your Lady. Sir, &s;ays &s;he, plea&s;e to walk
in, and &s;he will be here immediately. I obeyed
the old Hag's Command, and &s;eated my&s;elf in the
Dining Room, where the old Bawd fatigued me
with the ful&s;ome and impertinent Di&s;cour&s;e, con|cerning
her former antiquated Amours, and de|&s;ired
me to treat her with a Gla&s;s of Wine; I rea|dily
con&s;ented, and flung down two Shillings for a
Bottle; pre&s;ently after, in came my <HI>Phillis,</HI> I a|ro&s;e,
and paying my Re&s;pects, civilly &s;aluted her.
She returned the Compliment, and &s;eating her&s;elf
by me, with a plea&s;ing Air of Gaiety, and carele&s;s
Negligence, orders her Servant to put on the Tea
Kettle. Her Di&s;cour&s;e was melting and amorous,
which &s;o rai&s;ed my youthful Vigour, that unable
<PB N="27" REF="27">
any longer to oppo&s;e the mighty Force of Love,
with eager Ha&s;te, I conducted her to the Bed|chamber;
but not willing &s;o &s;oon to quit the Com|pany
of my Darling, I propo&s;ed a Supper at the
<HI>Fountain</HI> Tavern, in <HI>Katherine-&s;treet,</HI> and &s;he readily
yielded to my Reque&s;t. But it being Summer-Time,
and a fine Day, I handed her to the above|mentioned
Place of Rendezvous, but was (to my
Sorrow afterward) ob&s;erved and taken Notice of
by my Father, who watched my Motions, and &s;aw
me go into the &s;aid Tavern. Neverthele&s;s, for
&s;ome &s;ecret Cau&s;e unknown to me, he avoided my
Sight; and I wholly intent on my amorous Dalli|ances
of Love, never &s;o much as &s;aw him, nor had
the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of his being privy to my &s;ecret
Amour. In &s;hort, we had an elegant Supper,
Arrack Punch, Jellies, and other Provocations to
Lu&s;t, and about Three in the Morning I di&s;charg'd
the Reckoning, &s;atisfied my mercenary Nymph for
her Attendance, and well plea&s;ed with this my fir&s;t
Entrance into this new Scene of Life, went
Home, little thinking how dearly I &s;hould pay
for &s;o trivial and tran&s;itory a Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The next Day my Father called me to him, and
with an angry and frowning Countenance, a&s;ked me
where I had been Ye&s;terday in the Afternoon, and
what induced me to keep &s;uch unrea&s;onable
Hours? I replied that I had been at Church, and
afterwards in Company with two or three of my
Companions. Mr. <HI>Gilpert,</HI> &s;ays he, I know your
Tricks, and therefore think my&s;elf in Duty bound
to cha&s;ti&s;e, and re&s;train your libidinous Exce&s;&s;es, by
a timely and &s;evere Puni&s;hment; &s;o taking me
down into the Cellar, he made me &s;trip, and there
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;courg'd me very heartily with a Hor&s;ewhip, and
afterwards ordered that I &s;hould not be admitted
again to his Table, until by my future and good
Behaviour, I had amply atoned for my former pa&s;t
Offence. But this har&s;h Treatment had not the
de&s;ired Effect; for being bani&s;hed from my Fa|ther's,
I dined with the Maid, and my De&s;ires
daily waxed more fierce and ardent; wherefore to
appea&s;e the Rage and Torrent of Lu&s;t, I made a
vigorous Attack on the Servant, who neither
armed with the Shield of Mode&s;ty or Virtue, made
a faint Re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;oon rendered her&s;elf a
Victim. Nor was I wanting in Genero&s;ity to my
new and pretty. I cannot omit to tell you, that
one Day having bought a Pair of Gold laced Shoes
for my <HI>Chloe,</HI> (my Father being out) I called her
up into the Parlour, and &s;hut the Shop Door. Ma|dam,
&s;aid I, &s;aluting her; plea&s;e to accept of this
Trifle, and with it the Heart of your Admirer.
This, I pre&s;ume, is a Proof of your being &s;ole
Mi&s;tre&s;s of my E&s;teem and Affections, which I
&s;hall always maintain fixed and unalterable. Chloe
well plea&s;ed with the Pre&s;ent, fondly care&s;&s;ed me,
which &s;o fann'd the amorous Flame, that notwith|&s;tanding
my Father's expected immediate Return,
or any one's coming about Bu&s;ine&s;s, I ha&s;ten'd to
enjoy her. But as the Devil would have it my
Father knock'd at the Door, at which Confu&s;ion
and Shame o'er&s;pread my Countenance. However,
<HI>Chloe</HI> had the good Fortune to get off unperceived
by him, who &s;eeing the lac'd Shoes &s;tanding on
the Table, &s;aid, Pray who&s;e are the&s;e? methink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
they are very gay. I replied, Sir, a Lady of
whom I bought &s;ome Silver Lace, de&s;ir'd &s;he
<PB N="29" REF="29">
might leave them here till her return. This An|&s;wer
as I plainly perceived was not &s;atisfactory to
the old Gentleman, who ever after kept a &s;tricter
Eye both on my Conduct in Point of Hone&s;ty, and
Behaviour towards the Maid; wherefore I grew
more cautious and artful in tricking him of Ca&s;h,
and more vigilant and circum&s;pect in the Pur&s;uit
of my Amours, till having by Hypocri&s;y, and
a well di&s;&s;embled good Behaviour, rein&s;tated my
&s;elf in the Love and E&s;teem of my Father.</P>
<P>I was again admitted to his Table, and all for|mer
Flights of Youth buried in Oblivion, till one
<HI>Sunday</HI> Night coming Home drunk, and finding
no body there, but the Maid, I out of a Frolick,
toyed with her on the Kitchen Floor, but by ill
Fortune was again &s;urpriz'd by my Father, who
contrary to Cu&s;tom opening the Shutters of the
Kitchen Window, &s;aw me engaging in the amo|rous
Combat.</P>
<P>The Wench and I were both ignorant of this
unexpected Di&s;covery, and he for that Night took
no Notice thereof; but the next Morning he called
up the Maid, whom he immediately di&s;charged,
and &s;everely reprimanded me, vowing by all that
was good and &s;acred, that if I ever was guilty of
the like Impudence, he would totally di&s;card, and
turn me like a Vagabond out of Doors; and fur|thermore
to prevent &s;uch Di&s;orders in his Hou&s;e,
he hired a grave, &s;edate Matron, and who (as he
thought) was pa&s;t the Follies and Dalliances of
Love; but as there can be no Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for
that bewitching Pa&s;&s;ion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o neither the wrinkled
Furrows of her aged Face, nor the Vigilancy of
my Father, were able to re&s;train my furious and
<PB N="30" REF="30">
ardent De&s;ires of enjoying that living Sepulchre;
but as Youth and Age are as oppo&s;ite as Fire and
Water, &s;o the cold and feeble Embraces of this
antiquated Dame, &s;erv'd only to allay and quench
my lu&s;tful Ardour, which reillumin'd by the va|rious
and plea&s;ing Objects of the Town, therefore
in the Bloom of vigorous Youth I pur&s;ed the wil|ling
Fair ones, who tho' like the Apples of <HI>Go|morrah,</HI>
they appear beauteous and alluring without,
yet are their In&s;ides both rotten and pe&s;tilen|tial.</P>
<P>I &s;oon grew tainted by their poi&s;onous Infection,
for the Cure of which, I &s;ecretly apply'd my&s;elf to
an able Surgeon, who religiou&s;ly kept my Secret,
and faithfully di&s;charged his Tru&s;t with Honour
and Integrity.</P>
<P>One Evening being in Liquor, as I cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Drury
Lane,</HI> I was &s;aluted by a Female, who in a &s;oft
and engaging Voice &s;aid, Come my Dear, won't
you give me a Pint of Wine, and as <HI>Bacchus</HI> is
the con&s;tant Companion of Love, I replied, Yes,
my Angel; &s;o in I carried her to the <HI>Feathers</HI> Ta|vern,
up Stairs we went, and I called for a Bottle
of Wine, when as &s;oon as we had drank a Gla&s;s
or two a-piece, I grew pa&s;&s;ionately fond of my
new Prize, which &s;he ob&s;erving, and &s;eeing me
di&s;gui&s;ed in Liquor, re&s;olved to make her Market,
and therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon Half a Crown before
Hand; I conde&s;cended, and fooli&s;hly gave it her,
but was then no nearer the Point I aim'd at than
before: Well &s;aid &s;he, give me the other two Shil|lings
and Sixpence, and you &s;hall be fea&s;ted, which
I had no &s;ooner parted with, and was preparing for
the wanton Engagement, but upon a Stamp that
<PB N="31" REF="31">
&s;he gave with her Foot, in ru&s;h'd four more bold
Viragoes, who &s;eizing me, held my Hands, and
rifled my Pockets, &s;wearing that if I offered to
make a Noi&s;e, or cry out, that they would charge
me with a Con&s;table, for attempting to abu&s;e them.
At the Word Con&s;table, I was &s;orely affrighted,
fearing I &s;hould be expo&s;ed, and my Father be|come
acquainted therewith; wherefore I &s;eem|ingly
conde&s;cended to what I could by no Means
prevent.</P>
<P>When they had robbed me of every Thing valu|ble
except my Cloaths, they &s;wore they would
&s;trip me, if I did not call for a Bottle of Arrack,
wherefore to prevent the impending Ruin, that
would have proved my total Overthrow, I readily
&s;ubmitted to their Impo&s;ition, and ringing the
Bell odrered the Drawer to bring in my Forfeit,
(for that was the Term they ordered me to make
u&s;e of;) no &s;ooner was the Bottle out, but the &s;he
devils di&s;appeared, and left me alone to bemoan
my unfortunate di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I went to the Bar, and loudly com|plained
of the ill Treament I had met with, but it
availed nothing, for the Landlady in&s;i&s;ted on her
Reckoning, and &s;aid, Sir, I know nothing of the
Women, they came in with you, had you applied
to me for a Lady I &s;hould have provided you one,
and been accountable for her Civility and good
Behaviour; at length finding it in vain to di&s;pute,
I left my Wai&s;tcoat to &s;atisfy her Demands, and
went Home much &s;obered by the Fright and Sur|prize
that I had been in.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, &s;tanding alone at the Shop Door,
an old Woman came and gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> me a Letter &s;ealed with
<PB N="32" REF="32">
a Thimble, (a Mark peculiar to fallen Women) I
opened it, and found by the Scrawl, that it came from
the Maid whom my Father had formerly di&s;charged
on my Account; the Contents were, that &s;he was big
with Child, and expected in a Fortnight or three
Weeks to be brought to Bed; and therefore if I was
willing to &s;creen my&s;elf from Shame and Di&s;grace,
I mu&s;t take Care, pur&s;uant to the Directions in the
Letter, either to come and &s;ee her, or el&s;e &s;end a con|&s;tant
&s;upply during her lying-in; but that if I failed
to comply with her reque&s;t, that &s;he &s;hould through
nece&s;&s;ity be forced to expo&s;e me. I was not a little
&s;tartled at this &s;udden, and, as I thought, unrea&s;on|able
demand; however, I gave the Bearer half a
crown for her u&s;e, and &s;ixpence for her own trouble in
bringing the unwelcome letter, with a promi&s;e &s;hortly
to vi&s;it my Molly, and ea&s;e her under her misfortunes;
but as the old &s;aying is, <HI>Out of &s;ight out of Mind,</HI>
I forgot my promi&s;e, but &s;he &s;trictly ob&s;erved hers, for
in le&s;s than three Weeks &s;he &s;wore the ba&s;tard to me&punc;
and I was taken into cu&s;tody for the &s;ame. Hereupon
I immediately wrote to my father, who came and
pa&s;&s;ed his word to &s;ee the affair compounded, which he
in three days time, upon the payment of 15 <HI>l.</HI> with
the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy effected.</P>
<P>This was a &s;tanding memorial of my folly, and
therefore to blot out the remembrance of it, I &s;eemed
va&s;tly unea&s;y and &s;hagrined, in&s;omuch, that my father
took notice thereof, and kindly compa&s;&s;ionating my
anxious troubles, and di&s;quietude of mind, gener ou&s;ly
forgave the offence, and promi&s;ed never to reflect on
the&s;e my former f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ights of youth. Having thus freed
my&s;elf from this &s;candalous reflection, I pur&s;ued my
former plea&s;ures, and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in high e&s;teem and
<PB N="33" REF="33">
credit with my father, I artfully altering the figures
and current of the ca&s;h book, ama&s;&s;ed together a con|&s;iderable
&s;um, which I hid in the cellar, making u&s;e
thereof on extraordinary occa&s;ions. My reigning fa|vourit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
were <HI>Molly St. Gerrge, Phebe Player,</HI>
and <HI>Sally King,</HI> with whom I indulged my&s;elf in all
libidinous exce&s;&s;es, as often as time or opportunity
would permit.</P>
<P>Being now almo&s;t grown to man's e&s;tate, and my
father was taken very ill, and obliged to keep his bed,
and therefore the whole charge of the bu&s;ine&s;s lay upon
my hands, and to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice, (during the time
of his &s;ickne&s;s) I faithfully di&s;charged the great tru&s;t
repo&s;ed in me; honour, gratitude, and filial duty,
gaining the a&s;cendant over the ba&s;e allurements of a
depraved nature. Now the good gentleman dying, left
me a large fortune, and a &s;hop well &s;tocked with a|bundance
of plate, jewels, and other valuable effects,
as al&s;o a &s;et of worthy gentlemen for my cu&s;tomers,
who (to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onour and credit be it &s;poken) di&s;|charged
their debts due to the decea&s;ed, and continued
their favours to me his unworthy &s;on. My father no|minated
three Executors, viz. <HI>Francis Cunning,</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Richard Lacon,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Gilpin,</HI>
who all unanimou&s;ly agreed, that I, altho' under age,
&s;hould carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> as an
Over&s;eer and ob&s;erver of my behaviour in this new
&s;cene of life, boarded with me in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now the godde&s;s of fortune &s;eemed to &s;hower down
her favours on me, and my trade daily encrea&s;ing, I
found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to hire a journeyman, and
a boy to run on errands. I now totally relinqui&s;hed
all thoughts of extravagancy, abhorred and dete&s;ted
my former vicious cour&s;e of life, and therefore for my
<PB N="34" REF="34">
in&s;truction and amu&s;ement, I furni&s;hed my&s;elf with a
&s;elect library of books, and was &s;o con&s;tant and dili|gent
in my bu&s;ine&s;s, that it was the received and ge|neral
opinion of the town, that young <HI>Langley</HI> would
in a few years gain a plentiful e&s;tate; and had I been
&s;o happy as to have maintained the prudent and di&s;|creet
Oeconomy that I ob&s;erved at my fir&s;t launching
out into the world, I had certainly verified tho&s;e can|did
conceptions that the town in general had conceiv'd
of me; for in the fir&s;t year that I followed bu&s;ine&s;s,
upon the ballance of accounts, I found my&s;elf 700 <HI>l.</HI>
gainer by my trade, and that more likely to encrea&s;e
than dimini&s;h, if I trod tho&s;e paths in which I had &s;o
wi&s;ely began. But ala&s;s! what is &s;o prevalent on
youth as bad example, di&s;gui&s;ed under the fal&s;e pre|text
of paternal care, and inviolable friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>M. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> (whom I mentioned before) was the
only acting executor, wherefore to plea&s;e him was all
my earne&s;t care and &s;tudy; now this gentleman hav|ing
imprudently entru&s;ted me with my brother's for|tunes,
which were 1000 <HI>l.</HI> on the payment of 5 <HI>l.</HI> per
cent, I naturally grew fond of his company, and made
him a pre&s;ent of a gold watch and chain, thinking
thereby, more firmly to rivet my&s;elf in his affections,
and wholly engage him to my intere&s;t; and by my art|ful
and engaging behaviour, I won &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
him, that (laying a&s;ide the re&s;pect and awe du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to a guardian) he not only repo&s;ed an entire confidenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
in me, and never examined into the &s;tate of my affairs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
but cho&s;e, nay even in&s;i&s;ted on my being his companion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and partner in his frequent debauches, which by the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
continual repetitions &s;o vitiated my former principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
that the young gold&s;mith was &s;oon metamorpho&s;ed in
to the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e prodigal and &s;pend thrift.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35">
Thus having none to awe and re&s;train my unbound|le&s;s
and unlimited de&s;ires, I &s;oon became a profe&s;t rake,
and whorema&s;ter; I cannot forget one night, being in
company with <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> and having drank very plenti|fully,
I propo&s;ed to conduct him to the apartments of
one of my favourite ladies; he &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed
with the proffer, and took coach and drove to madam's
lodgings, who being a well bred woman, entertained us
in a courteous and obliging manner: The old gentle|man
was &s;oon captivated with her charms, and burn'd
for enjoyment, which I ob&s;erving, called her a&s;ide,
and &s;aid, Madam, the gentleman is my uncle, and
therefore I de&s;ire you would oblige him, and me al&s;o,
in the reque&s;t I am now going to make you; &s;he, with
a &s;mile con&s;ented; whereupon, I ordered her, whil&s;t
the fumbler was in the vain pur&s;uit of delight, to
pick his pocket of &s;ome notes that I knew he had
about him. She faithfully performed her promi&s;e,
and afterwards gave them into my Hands.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, &s;he and he (after &s;everal at|tempts
to do, what in reality he could not effect) re|turned
into the dining-room, little thinking of the
merry trick that had been put upon him. To be brief,
we &s;taid till about three in the morning, then calling a
coach, went home.</P>
<P>The next day, recollecting him&s;elf where he had
been, and mi&s;&s;ing his bills, called for me, and acquaint|ed
me with his lo&s;s, and that he &s;u&s;pected that, that
damn'd painted whore had &s;tolen them from him. I
&s;eemed to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ware, that I believed
&s;he would &s;corn &s;o ba&s;e an action, but that for his
&s;atisfaction, I would go and enquire into the matter,
and at the &s;ame time let him know, that if &s;he had
them, &s;he would in&s;i&s;t on a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent on the
<PB N="36" REF="36">
delivery of the &s;ame; damn her, &s;ays he, give her two
guineas, and place them to my account. Thus the old
gentleman paid the forfeit due to his folly, and Mrs.
<HI>Morris</HI> and I revelled the en&s;uing night at his co&s;t
and charge. This impo&s;ition gave the old fool &s;uch a
di&s;ta&s;te and abhorrence to the female pro&s;titutes, that
after I had returned him his notes, he &s;olemly vowed
and declared never to conver&s;e with any of them for
the future.</P>
<P>Sometime after, (as the Biter is Bit at la&s;t) a
Gentleman well dre&s;&s;ed, &s;topt at my Door in a
Coach, and coming into the Shop, complimented
me on my Father's Decea&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed the
great Value and E&s;teem he had for him, and that
upon his Account he was willing to continue his
Favours, for the Encouragement of me his Son.
I humbly thank'd him for his Civility, and told
him, I &s;hould &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavour to maintain
the good Repute, and fair Character of my decea&s;|ed
Father, by a &s;trict Adherence to his Principles
of inviolable Honour, and Integrity. He, full
fraught with Deceit, &s;eem'd highly plea&s;ed with
my Reply; and therefore, as a &s;eeming Promi&s;e of
his Friend&s;hip, be&s;poke 150<HI>l.</HI> worth of Plate, and
after he had given me the Impre&s;&s;ion of his Coat
of Arms, from a Seal that hung to his Gold
Watch, &s;aid, He &s;hould be glad to take a Gla&s;s of
Wine with me. I was proud of the Honour, and
we went to a neighbouring Tavern, where drink|ing
plentifully, he took the Opportunity, whil&s;t I
was elevated with Liquor, to propo&s;e a Lady to me
in Marriage, who (altho' deform'd) he &s;aid, had
50,000<HI>l.</HI> Fortune; and further more he added&punc;
that &s;he was under his Tuition, and Direction of
<PB N="37" REF="37">
his Spou&s;e; and that if I plea&s;ed to come down to
his Country Seat, he would engage to gain her
Con&s;ent, and bring her to a very &s;peedy Compli|ance.</P>
<P>This artful Bait had its de&s;ir'd Effect, for I now
not only look'd on him as a good Cu&s;tomer, but
as a worthy Friend, and therefore I invited him
to Dinner with me the next Day, and he in return
engaged me to &s;up with him the next Evening at
his Lodgings in Tavi&s;tock-Street where an elegant
Entertainment was provided. The Chambers
were richly furni&s;h'd, and illuminated with Wax
Candles&punc; in &s;ilver Candle&s;ticks, and Sconces, in
the &s;ame Metal; two Footmen in lac'd Liveries
waited at Supper, and every Thing augmented
the Opinion I had already received of his being
a Gentleman of a large and plentiful E&s;tate. A|bout
Twelve I took my Leave of him, and the
next Day gave Orders for getting ready his Plate
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, which being done, he in about a
Week's Time came to me; I &s;hew'd him the
Plate, with which he was extreamly plea&s;ed, and
highly commended the curious Workman&s;hip
thereof; and &s;aid, Sir, Come let's take a Bottle
before we part, for to Morrow Morning I mu&s;t go
to my Country Seat. I with Plea&s;ure yielded to
his Reque&s;t, and whil&s;t we were in the Tavern,
he pull'd out his Pocket-Book, and gave me a
Note on a Vintner in Bartholomew-Clo&s;e, for
150 <HI>l.</HI> payable in three Weeks; &s;aying, Sir, This
I pre&s;ume is the &s;ame to you as ready Ca&s;h; but
plea&s;e for your own Satisfaction, to &s;end immedi|ately
and enquire into the Character of the Man&punc;
I readily obey'd his Order, and finding by the
<PB N="38" REF="38">
Account I receiv'd from my Servant, that the
Vintner was a Per&s;on of a fair Character; upon
his Endor&s;ement of the Note, I accepted it in full
Payment for my Goods, and &s;ent the Plate pack'd
up to the Gun Tavern at Billing&s;gate, pur&s;uant to
his Order; neither did I forget to take a Direction
where he liv'd in the Country, but promi&s;ed, as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to vi&s;it my intended&punc; wealthy
Bride.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we parted, and I went Home quite
blown up with the a&s;piring Thoughts of rai&s;ing my
Fortune at once and making a &s;plendid and gay
Appearance in the World; but as I lay one Night
in my Bed, ruminating on the imaginary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Nymph, who (like the Godde&s;s of Riches)
was to load me with her Favours a &s;udden Thought
eclip&s;ed my Joys, perhaps (&s;ays I to my&s;elf) I am
deceived, and this great Fortune like Fary-land,
as &s;oon as &s;een di&s;appears, wherefore I re&s;olv'd to
&s;end to my Neighbour <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> (a cunning and artful
Man, who&s;e Veracity and Integrity I had often
experienced) the next Day down to the Gentleman's
Seat, with Orders to make a private Enquiry in
the Neighbourhood, of the Truth and Reality of
what my &s;eeming Friend had given me &s;o fair an
Expectance of. Accordingly I gave him two
Guineas, and loaded with In&s;tructions, he de|parted.</P>
<P>I was now rack'd with alternate Hope and Fear
till his Return, which was in three Days Time,
when he ingeniou&s;ly told me, that after the utmo&s;t
Search and &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny it was po&s;&s;ible for
Man to make, he could not find out, or even hear
of any &s;uch Gentleman or Lady that ever lived or
<PB N="39" REF="39">
re&s;ided in that Country. This was &s;hocking News
to me, and I rea&s;onably conjectured, that &s;ince
I was deceiv'd in my Mi&s;tre&s;s, there was al&s;o &s;ome
Fallacy in the Note he had given me in Payment
for my Goods; but &s;ince I had accepted the &s;ame,
I knew no other Remedy but to wait with Patience,
till Time &s;hould bring to Light the Fraud, and
di&s;cover the whole Villainy. As I judged, &s;o it
happened, for on &s;ending my Servant with the
Note, after three Days Grace to demand the Mo|ney,
the Vintner was gone, and his Hou&s;e &s;hut
up. Highly incens'd at this ba&s;e and &s;candalous
Trick I vowed revenge on the pretended Gentle|man,
and re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible, at all Events, to lay
him by the Heels, and make an Example of him,
to deter others from the like Fal&s;hood and Trea|chery.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight afterwards, a Gentlewoman
came to my Shop, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with me
in private; I led her into the Parlour, where &s;he
immediately bur&s;t out into Tears, and for &s;ome
Time, could not utter a Word, till being recover'd
from her Di&s;order, &s;he &s;aid, Sir, I am ruin'd and
undone for ever, that Villain <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> has impo&s;ed on
my Hu&s;band's Credulity, and under a Pretence of

has obtain'd three Notes of Hand of him for 150 <HI>l.</HI>
each, which he has paid away, and applied the
Money to his own U&s;e.</P>
<P>This (I confe&s;s) at fir&s;t &s;tartled me, but upon a
further enquiry, I found that her hu&s;band was the
&s;ame per&s;on on whom <HI>I</HI> had the abovementioned note,

not to trouble her hu&s;band, but al&s;o to u&s;e my
intere&s;t and endeavour with the other gentlemen (my
fellow &s;ufferers in the fraud) to engage them to a com|pliance,

and departed, leaving directions with me where to

<P>Next Day, according to my promi&s;e, I went to
the Gentlemen, who being of tender and human
Di&s;po&s;itions, were ea&s;ily brought to an Accom|modation,
wherefore &s;ending for <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> and
an Attorney, we agreed on Terms to the Satisfac|tion
of all Parties. But one Day walking along
<HI>Fleet Street,</HI> near St. <HI>Dun&s;tan's,</HI> a &s;trange Gentleman
came up to me, and a&s;ked me, whether my Name
was not <HI>Langley,</HI> I replied, Yes. Sir, &s;ays he,
have you not a Demand on one <HI>Anthony G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>?
Yes, Sir, quoth I, well then &s;aid he, we'll &s;tep in|to
the Bull Head, and there I'll inform you further
of the Matter. So in we went, where he told me,
that he had <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Dead-&s;et,</HI> and that if I would
give him one Guinea, he would engage to have
him in clo&s;e Quarters in le&s;s than an Hour,
Overjoyed at this News, I freely granted him his
Demand, and told him that I would wait there till
his return; but had I been as good as my Word, I
&s;hould have &s;taid there till now, for I never &s;aw
him afterwards. This &s;econd Bite exa&s;perated me
more than the former, and I re&s;olved if ever I
<PB N="41" REF="41">
caught <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> to make him pay for all. Where|fore
I employed a bri&s;k and expert Attorney to
hunt him out, and promi&s;ed to be accountable for
all Charges in the Execution thereof. At la&s;t, I
took the Villain, and clapt him into the <HI>Mar&s;hal|-Pri&s;on,</HI>
where he obliged me to &s;ue him to an Ex|ecution,
and there he remained during the whole
Time that I continued in Trade.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, I became acquainted with
a Vintner, near Gray's Inn Gate, in Holborn,
with whom I contracted &s;uch an Intimacy that very
Evening I paid a Vi&s;it, and he was fooli&s;hly fond
of Hor&s;e Racing, Cock Fighting, Hunting, and
the like expen&s;ive and co&s;tly Pa&s;times, and Diver|&s;ions,
and being a con&s;tant Attendant at <HI>Newmarket</HI>
Sea&s;ons, kept a good Gelding for that Purpo&s;e.
Being daily at his Hou&s;e, he often &s;ollicited me to
accompany him thither, and greatly enlarged on
the Grandeur of the A&s;&s;embly, and the Variety of
Recreations and Amu&s;ements that pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
for the Delight of the curious Spectators.
At la&s;t, I yielded to his Reque&s;t, and furni&s;hed
my&s;elf with a good Saddle Hor&s;e, and other
Jockey-like Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rements, &s;uitable to the Hu|mour

<HI>Pagods.</HI> Here it was that I fir&s;t caught the ruin|ous
Itch of Gaming, which was ever after &s;o pre|valent,
that I could not &s;ee a Box and Dice, but I
was as fond of the Gewgaw as a Child is of a Rattle,
and at fir&s;t (as the old Saying is, <HI>the Devil is kind to
a young Game&s;ter</HI>) I won upwards of 700 l. and had
the Wit and Di&s;cretion to carry it off; but this
was but a glimmering of life, that vainly buoys
up the departing Patient, before the fatal approach
of Death; for in le&s;s than &s;ix Months, I doubled
the Lo&s;s of my former Gain, and by my too fre|quent
Extravagancies, now found my Circum|&s;tances
in a melancholy Po&s;ture, and my Sub&s;tance
va&s;tly impaired; however, I play'd my Cards &s;o
artfully, that none of my Creditors ever &s;u&s;pected
me in the lea&s;t guilty of &s;o much Imprudence and
Folly.</P>
<P>One Day being at my Friend the Vintner's
Hou&s;e, he called me a&s;ide, and de&s;ired me to take
his Niece to my Service; I readily conde&s;cended,
and giving my old Servant a Month's Warning,
<PB N="44" REF="44">
prepared for the Reception of the new one, whom,
on her Uncle's Account, I always u&s;ed with the
utmo&s;t Civility and good Manners. In &s;hort, af|ter
&s;he had been with me a Month, I di&s;covered
&s;omething &s;o innocent and mode&s;t in her Behaviour,
that &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me, that in de&s;pite of
my vicious and inordinate De&s;ires, her Virtue &s;o
awed and re&s;trained my villainous Intentions, that
for &s;ome Time, I dur&s;t not approach her but with
the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect and Mode&s;ty, till one fatal
Night to her, coming Home a little elate with
Liquor, I called for a Bottle of Wine, and de&s;ired
her Company to partake of it; &s;he with a Blu&s;h
mode&s;tly excu&s;ed her&s;elf, which rather heightened
than dimini&s;hed my Pa&s;&s;ion; and therefore I in|&s;i&s;ted
on her Compliance with my friendly Re|que&s;t;
&s;he con&s;ented, and I took this favourable
Opportunity to acquaint her with my &s;incere Love,
and E&s;teem; then turning the Di&s;cour&s;e to an amo|rous
Scene, gave her to under&s;tand, by a double
Entendre, the Meaning of my foul De&s;ign. Whe|ther
her amorous Star had then the A&s;cendant, I
&s;oon read her approaching De&s;tiny, who was then
upon the Point of being ruined by me, without
any Regard to my former E&s;teem for her, or the
Friend&s;hip I had long profe&s;&s;ed to her Uncle; &s;uch
Is the Worth of a Man given up to Lu&s;t, and of
&s;uch Value his Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>My own Hou&s;e, which before &s;eemed to me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Pri&s;on, was now changed into a perfect <HI>Ely&s;ium&punc;</HI>

Ends, and was far more de&s;erving of being
the legal Partner of a Marriage Bed, than Mi&s;tre&s;s
of a lawle&s;s Love, that &s;ometime or other would
prove her Ruin.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, had I been &s;o happy and prudent, as to
have made her my Wife, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that
the Union of the &s;acred Knot, would have ex|empted
me from various Inconveniences, that de|&s;table
Poverty and horrid Want in the Sequal ex|po&s;ed
me to. During the Heat of my Amour, I
had &s;everal advantageous Offers of Marriage pro|po&s;ed
to me, which I declined for the following
Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Parents or Friends of &s;uch
young Ladies that were actually in a Capacity to
be&s;tow on them large Fortunes, in&s;i&s;ted on proper
Settlements for their Daughters, and al&s;o an exact
Scrutiny into my Affairs, which although by my
artful and deceitful Conduct, appeared to be in a
flouri&s;hing Condition, yet if nicely examined into,
there was nothing to be found, but the Ruins, and
poor Remains of a &s;hattered Fortune; for by this
Time I had obtained a con&s;iderable Credit from &s;e|veral
Merchants in Jewels, and by the punctual
Payment of my Bills, my Notes pa&s;&s;ed as current
as tho&s;e of the <HI>Bank,</HI> and I confequently was re|puted
a great and eminent Trader, particularly in
that mo&s;t advantageous and profitable Part of Bu|&s;ine&s;s;
but ala&s;s! to my Sorrow, I only fulfilled
the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb, <HI>Robbing</HI> Peter to <HI>pay</HI>
Paul; for under the &s;pecious Pretence of di&s;po&s;ing
of the abovementioned Goods to Per&s;ons of Qua|lity,
I &s;ecretly pawned them to tho&s;e, who out of
a &s;ordid Lucre of Gain, and an avaracious De&s;ire of
<PB N="46" REF="46">
more than legal Intere&s;t, &s;upplied me with what
Ca&s;h I required, and by their Indi&s;cretion and Fol|ly,
in relyiag on my Integrity, &s;uffered them to be
greatly impo&s;ed upon by me, who frequently bor|rowed
larger Sums on tho&s;e Goods, than what I
had contracted to pay for them.</P>
<P>By this Means I had always a large Quantity of
Money at my Command, and thinking this Arti|fice
would always pa&s;s undi&s;covered, I liv'd more
like an Heir apparent to a great E&s;tate, than a
wary and indu&s;trious Trade&s;man. A&s;&s;emblies,
Opera's, Ma&s;querades, Plays, and Country Jour|nies,
were now my only Delight, and my
&s;ole favourite Companions, &s;uch young Gentle|men,
who were either in the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of large E&s;tates, or in a fair Expectation of the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>I can't omit, that two of the&s;e young Sparks
and I, having made an Agreement to pa&s;s a Fort|night
or three Weeks at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for the Benefit
of the Air in the Summer Sea&s;on, we quartered
at the <HI>Greyhound</HI> Inn there; when one Evening
over a merry Bottle, a Propo&s;al was made to pa|trole
through the Town in que&s;t of Ladies of
Plea&s;ure, which was readily agreed too by all Par|ties;
but finding none there either hand&s;ome enough
or fitting for our Purpo&s;es, I immediately pro|po&s;ed
to return to <HI>London,</HI> and bring down three
of the be&s;t of that Stamp, that I could find were
willing to indulge them&s;elves with the Diver&s;ions
of a Country Life. My Companions highly ap|plauded
my De&s;ign, and I took a pair of Oars,
which pre&s;ently wa&s;ted me to <HI>Temple-Stairs,</HI> where
<PB N="47" REF="47">
as &s;oon as I landed, I went in Pur&s;uit of my Game,
and being well known to the Porter at the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI>
in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> to him I apply'd for the Execu|tion
of my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Porter went directly out, whil&s;t I called for
a Pint of Wine, to wait for his Return, who in a|bout
half an Hour's Time brought three wanton
La&s;&s;es well dre&s;&s;ed, and not di&s;agreeable; I aro&s;e,
and &s;aluting them, &s;aid, Ladies, plea&s;e to &s;eat your|&s;elves;
my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to acquaint you, that your
Company is de&s;ired for a Fortnight or three Weeks
at Greenwich, where you may be a&s;&s;ured to be
treated in the mo&s;t courteous and polite Manner;
for the Per&s;ons that you will have to do with,
are Gentlemen of Honour, and therefore if you
approve of my Propo&s;al, plea&s;e to provide your|&s;elves
with &s;uch Linnen and Apparel as you &s;hall
think proper for your U&s;e, during your Re&s;i|dence
in the Country, I'll remain here an Hour
longer; &s;o Ladies, if ye are willing, go and pre|pare
your&s;elves for the Journey. They unani|mou&s;ly
agreed, and dropping a Curti&s;ie at their go|ing
out of the Room, returned with their Bag|gage
within the Time appointed. I called a Coach
and drove to the <HI>Temple Stairs,</HI> where I took a Pair
of Oars, and landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> but not without
the repeated In&s;ults of opprobious Language, com|monly
u&s;ed by the Vulgar on the <HI>Thames</HI>; how|ever,
my Female Companions verified the Latin
Adage, <HI>Nemo me impune lace&s;&s;it,</HI> and returned their
Scurrility with as &s;mart and &s;atyrical repartees, as
if they had &s;erved a &s;even Years Apprentice&s;hip
to any of the mo&s;t celebrated Fi&s;hwomen at <HI>Bil|ling&s;gate.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48">
I looked upon my&s;elf now as an Ea&s;tern Mo|narch,
bearing as ab&s;olute Sway in my floating
Seraglio, as the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> ever did in his
&s;umptuous Edifice at <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> In &s;hort I
conducted the Ladies to the <HI>Greyhound</HI> Inn, where
my Companions were with Impatience, waiting
for my Return. Upon our Entrance into the
Room, they civilly complimented the Women,
and we being all &s;eated, I &s;aid, Gentlemen, I pre|&s;ume
I have an&s;wered your Expectations, and
honourably di&s;charged my Tru&s;t, plea&s;e therefore
to take the fir&s;t Choice, and the Nymph that hath
not the Honour to plea&s;e either of you, &s;hall be
the Co-Partner of my Bed, and be taken under
immediate Care and Protection. This generous
Offer augmented their Delight, and each <HI>Pyramis</HI>
cho&s;e his favourite <HI>Thi&s;be.</HI> Now nothing was to
be &s;een but perfect Harmony, and an uninterrupt|ed
Scene of Joys, the Gods of Love and Wine,
by alternate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, re&s;ided in our Hearts, nor
were the <HI>Sylvan</HI> Deities exempt from participating
the mutual and tran&s;porting Plea&s;ures that we ful|ly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the &s;hady Retirement of the ad|jacent
Park; but tho&s;e &s;oft and endearing Care&s;&s;es
of our amorous Godde&s;&s;es, by reiterated Repi|titions,
grew dull and infipid, and we cloy'd and
wearied with the continual Performance of daily
Sacrifice to the <HI>Cyprian</HI> Dame, re&s;olved to put a
merry Trick upon the Ladies, and leave them in
the Lurch.</P>
<P>One Day after we had dined, we de&s;ired them to
go and walk in the Park, and we would follow im|mediately
and order the Tea-kettle, and other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
to be brought up with us thither.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
They &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with our Reque&s;t, and
readily obeyed, whereupon we called our Landlord, and
paid him his Bill, and then cro&s;&s;ed the Water to the
<HI>I&s;le of Dogs,</HI> where we &s;pent the Remainder of the
Day in Mirth and Jollity, highly diverted that we
had bilked the Pro&s;titutes of their expected Fare.
They walked in the Park a long Time, and &s;eeing no
Appearance of us, or the Servant of the Hou&s;e, re|turned
to the Inn, and on Enquiry, finding that we
were gone, (as the Landlord told them by our Order)
to London, they quarrelled with each other for their
Folly, in complying with our Reque&s;t, before they had
had Satisfaction for their Ware; but finding it in
vain to trifle away their Time in railing and &s;colding to
no Purpo&s;e, they hired a Pair of Oars for <HI>London</HI>
and as ill Fortune would have it, our Boats both met
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ver-again&s;t <HI>Cuckolds Point</HI>; they immediately &s;et
up a Cry, that both alarmed and &s;urprized us, the

as fa&s;t as we could, and encouraging our Watermen to
make Way, we in &s;pite of our Adver&s;aries, kept a|bout
&s;our Boats Length a-head of them, but were
forced to bear the La&s;h of their Tongues, till we got
within three or four Yards of the Landing Place of
the <HI>Temple,</HI> and then we jumped a&s;hore, making the
be&s;t of our Way to one of the Gentlemen's Chambers,
to prevent the Scandal and Di&s;turbance that would
have en&s;ued, had they come up with us.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, a married Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, de&s;ired me to accompany him and his
Spou&s;e to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to which I readily a&s;&s;ented, be|ing
glad of the Opportunity to make knownn my Affec|tions
to Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny,</HI> their Chambermaid, we &s;topt
at the Gun Tavern at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> and put three
<PB N="50" REF="50">
Bottles of Wine into the Boat, to animate our Spirits,
and excite Mirth and Gaiety in our Pa&s;&s;age to the in|tended
Port. The Gentleman a&s;ked me, if I could re|commend
him to an Inn? Yes, Sir, I replyed, and
the be&s;t in Town, where I have been very civilly en|tertained,
the Landlord knows me perfectly well, and
I'll engage that you and your Lady &s;hall be accommo|dated
to the utmo&s;t of your De&s;ires; and as for Mi&s;s
<HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;ays I, in a joco&s;e Manner, I'll recommend
her to a bri&s;k young Fellow, that's worth Money,
though he &s;erves as a Drawer in the Hou&s;e; <HI>Jenny</HI>

a brave Bumper to the good Succe&s;s of this new A|mour.</P>
<P>In an Hour's Time we landed, and I led the Way
to my Inn the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> where the Ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed
a great Satisfaction in &s;eeing me, and returned me
Thanks for the Favour I did him, in recommending
his Hou&s;e. Here we ordered a Supper, and <HI>I</HI> took an
Opportunity, whil&s;t <HI>Jenny</HI> was in the Kitchen, to let
her know how pa&s;&s;ionately I loved her, and by a &s;ted|fa&s;t
Ob&s;ervance of her Eyes, found that my Propo&s;als
were not di&s;agreeable; wherefore I holdly urged her to
yield to my Embraces, could it be managed with Se|crecy;
whereupon I faithfully promi&s;ed to contrive the
Matter with &s;o much Privacy ond Cunning, that
none in the Hou&s;e &s;hould have the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion to
dream or &s;u&s;pect any Thing of our Amour. With
this &s;olemn A&s;&s;urance of Secrecy, confirmed with a
Volley of Oaths and Imprecations, <HI>Jenny</HI> con&s;ented,
and the only Difficulty remaining was, to engage the
Chambermaid to be faithful to her Tru&s;t; wherefore
I immediately took her a&s;ide, and &s;liding half a Gui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">
into her Hand, imparted my De&s;ign to her, who
<PB N="51" REF="51">
promi&s;ed to perform her Part to my Satisfaction. At
Supper we were exceeding merry&punc; amd I was highly
plea&s;ed at the Conceit of my new Favourite, when we
ogled each other as the Figures in an old Suit of
Hangings.</P>
<P>The Hour of Repo&s;e drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">igh, my Friend
called to the Chambermaid to &s;hew him a Room
with two Beds in it, one for him&s;elf and Spou&s;e,

&s;ame Chamber with them; but it was all in vain,
for the artful Hu&s;&s;ey, well vers'd in Intrigues,
with an hypocritical Cant and Smile, declared, that
would the Gentleman give her fifty Pounds, &s;he
could not oblige him with that Favour, for all the
Rooms (except tho&s;e re&s;erved for our Lodgings)
were taken up and engaged. The Gentleman be|ing
an ea&s;y credulous Per&s;on, believed what &s;he
&s;aid was true, &s;o ordering her and Jenny to light
them to bed, took his Leave of me for that Night.
As &s;oon as they were gone up Stairs, I called for a
Bottle of Wine, and &s;at &s;moaking my Pipe with
Impatience, waiting the Return of my Mi&s;tre&s;s,
who as &s;oon as &s;he had undre&s;&s;ed her Lady, and put
her to bed, came and &s;at down by me, and pre|&s;ently
after in came my true and faithful Confident,
whom I de&s;ired to &s;it down and bear us Company.
When the Bottle was out, I de&s;ired her to &s;hew us
to our Room, and bring a Cool-Tankard with her
up Stairs. The Chamber we lay in was up two
Pair of Stairs backwards, and commodiou&s;ly con|trived
for the like Intrigues, for there was two

that &s;uppo&s;ing the Gentleman had had any Su&s;pi|cion,
and &s;hould have attempted (if he had known
my Apartment) to &s;urprize us, it was morally
impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;ucceed in his De&s;ign, for
as I locked the Door fronting the great Stair-ca&s;e,
before we went to bed, &s;o I could ea&s;ily have con|cealed
my Doxy, by turning her out at the pri|vate

had &s;omething el&s;e to think on, for although Jenny
and I lay together during our whole Stay there, nei|ther
he or his Spou&s;e ever imagined any thing of
the Matter. In about ten Days we returned to
London, where I vi&s;i&s;ted him as u&s;ual, and by pri|vate
Billets appointed my Charmer at the <HI>Blue Po&s;ts</HI>
without <HI>Temple Bar</HI>; &s;he was truly ob&s;ervant to my

Time, ob&s;erved that &s;he was with Child,
till at la&s;t unable to conceal&punc; her public Shame any
longer, &s;he quitted her Service, and took private
Lodgings, from whence &s;he daily plagued me
with ful&s;ome Letters &s;tuffed with Non&s;ence and
Love, with which (being pretty well cloyed) the
Remembrance of her former Embraces was grown
not only grating but loath&s;ome. However, rather
than to &s;uffer her to lay the Child to me, I ap|pointed
her a Meeting, where to acquit my&s;elf
with Honour, I gave her a Pur&s;e of Guineas, and
there took my final Leave of her, neither have I
ever heard of her &s;ince, nor would the Gentleman
or his Lady have been acquainted with this our A|mour,
had I not now publi&s;hed it to the World.
But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Exce&s;&s;es, <HI>Clarinda,</HI> by
<PB N="53" REF="53">
Merit claimed the greate&s;t Share of my Affecti|ons;
and being acquainted with all my Follies and
Extravagancies, &s;he often with an engaging and
per&s;ua&s;ive Air, repre&s;ented the di&s;mal State of
Want and griping Penury, which &s;he clearly fore|&s;aw
mu&s;t be the future I&s;&s;ue of my profu&s;e and
licentious Manner of Life; and as often with re|peated
A&s;&s;urances of real Love and &s;incere Friend|&s;hip,
warmly pre&s;&s;ed me to de&s;i&s;t, and leave my
vicious Cour&s;es; but all her Tears and amicable
Admonitions prov'd abortive, and unable to curb
and re&s;train me in the full Career of my lawle&s;s
Pa&s;&s;ions, that blindly hurried me on to my utter
Ruin. However, to do her Ju&s;tice, although &s;he
knew the Parties of whom I had borrow'd con&s;ider|able
Sums of Money, and doubtle&s;s might by a
Di&s;covery of my Affairs, been amply rewarded
by them; yet &s;o exten&s;ive was the Genero&s;ity of
her Soul, that &s;he di&s;dain'd &s;o vile and &s;ordid a
Practice, and dete&s;ted and abhorred &s;uch mean and
mercenary Views.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, I went to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> with
my particular and worthy Friend Capt. L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, his
Spou&s;e, and a young Lady a Relation of his. We
were very merry in our Journey, and during our
Re&s;idence there, we enjoyed all the Diver&s;ion of a
rural Life, for having a&punc; Coach and four at Com|mand,
we took the Benefit of the Morning Air
in the Park, and her Grace the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marl|borough,</HI>
being then in <HI>London,</HI> we frequently vi|&s;ited
her Lodge, celebrated for its curious and in|imitable
Pieces of Painting; and in the Afternoon
drove to the antient College of Eton, fam'd for
Learning, and &s;o eminent in the Numbers of bright
<PB N="54" REF="54">
and ingenious Gentlemen, who are de&s;ervedly
deem'd the Pride and Glory of their Country;
Nor was the Ca&s;tle unob&s;erv'd, that noble and
magnificent Structure, &s;o much honoured with the
Pre&s;ence of our ancient Monarchs, and greatly or|namented
and embelli&s;h'd by various and bizarre
Figures, form'd in different Shapes, from Num|berle&s;s
Arms, by the ingenious and artful Contri|vers.
Here is al&s;o a beauteous Terras, command|ing
a delightful Pro&s;pect of all the adjacent Coun|try,
and from whence the curious Spectators are
gratified with a View of the &s;tately Cathedral of
St. <HI>Paul's</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> Love and Gallantry were
now the fole Topicks of our Conver&s;ation, and
the young Lady being &s;ingle, I made honourable
Propo&s;als of Love to her, with which neither &s;he,
nor the Captain or his Lady, were in the lea&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ed.
In a Fortnight's Time we returned to
Town, and &s;topped at the St. <HI>Alban's</HI>-Tavern in St.
<HI>Alban's-Street,</HI> where we ordered a Supper and the
Footman to bring the Arms that we carry'd into
the Country for our Safeguard and Defence into
our Room. After Supper, we drank plentifully,
and Wine growing more potent than Rea&s;on, the
Captain (for variety Sake) would ki&s;s my fair Com|panion,
whereby I thinking my Property infring'd
oppo&s;ed his Intent, upon which Words aro&s;e, and
the Pi&s;tols lying on a Marble Slab in the Room,
we each of us ha&s;tily &s;natch'd up one of them, and
pre&s;enting, attempted to give Fire; but were pro|videntially
di&s;appointed in our De&s;ign, by the Di|ligence
and Care of the Footman, who had un|loaded
them, well knowing the capricious Temper
of his Ma&s;ter, when di&s;guis'd in Liquor. The
<PB N="55" REF="55">
Ladies were &s;orely affrighted at this &s;urprizing
Rencountre, and &s;kream'd out, at which the
Landlord and his Drawers came in upon us, and
&s;eeing us (for we had thrown down our Arms)
hard at it with our Fi&s;ts, parted us, and calling two
Coaches &s;ent us home to our re&s;pective Habita|tions.
Next Morning when I awak'd, I was igno|rant
of what had happened, and about Eleven the
Captain came to &s;ee me, then we went to take our
Mornings Draught, when, upon &s;aying what
News, Sir? News, quoth he, my Wife tells me
that you and I were going to murther one another
la&s;t Night, on Mi&s;s <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Account, but I declare
upon Honour, that I knew nothing of it, and
&s;ince it was a mad Frolick, I'll engage the young
Lady to be at my Hou&s;e this Evening, and &s;hall
expect your Company there likewi&s;e. I punctually
obey'd his Orders, and we &s;pent the Evening very
agreeably, all Strife and Contention gave Place
to Mirth and Gaiety: We a&s;k'd the Ladies Pardon
for putting them in a Fright, which they readily
granted, and Mi&s;s <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> with a plea&s;ing and jo|co&s;e
Air, added, that &s;he had conceiv'd a much
better Opinion of her&s;elf than &s;he ever had before,
&s;ince two &s;uch Gentlemen, at the hazard of their
Lives, had contended for her Favours; whereupon
bowing we returned the Compliment, and it now
growing late, I waited on Mi&s;s Home. All Night
I was no more Ma&s;ter of my own Per&s;on, but
pa&s;s'd the tedious Night rack'd with alternate Hope
and Fear. The next Evening, I &s;ent for the Cap|tain
to the Queen's-Head Tavern in <HI>Holhorn,</HI> and
there (to ea&s;e my Torment) di&s;clos'd my ardent
Pa&s;&s;ion; he Gentleman-like, in an open and free
<PB N="56" REF="56">
Manner told me that her Fortune was but &s;mall,
and that too, in the Hands of tho&s;e who he feared
would not, without Difficulty, &s;urrender it. How|ever,
&s;aid he, if you are upon honourable Terms,
I'll u&s;e my intere&s;t to bring Mi&s;s to a Compliance.
Sir, &s;ays I, I &s;hould think my&s;elf unde&s;erving of
that Frieud&s;hip you always profe&s;&s;ed for me, &s;hould
I even pre&s;ume to entertain the lea&s;t Glymp&s;e of
a di&s;honourable Thought for a young Lady any
ways releated to your worthy Family. Hereupon
the Captain well plea&s;ed with my generous Reply,
told me where her Uncle lived, and in a friendly
Manner advi&s;ed me to apply to him, who being a
Gentleman of Fortune, if he approved of my
Propo&s;al, would inevitably compel her Guardians
to pay her Fortune upon the Marriage Day. Pur+&s;uant
to my Friend's good Coun&s;el, I went to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Uncle and to him opened the whole Affair, who
&s;eemed very willing for the Match, and promi&s;ed
his Friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the Recovery of her
Fortune.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained, but the u&s;ual Ceremony
of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ew Days Court&s;hip, and therefore I, with
free Con&s;ent and Permi&s;&s;ion of her Friends, vi&s;ited
her daily; but as the old Saying is, many Things
happen between the Cup and the Lip, for this
young Lady had a younger Si&s;ter, who for the
fir&s;t two or three Days that I went to the Hou&s;e
treated me with an Air of Indifferency, even littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Inferior to that of Ill-manners. However, I too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
no Notice of it, but continuing my Court&s;hip a
u&s;ual, I &s;oon &s;aw the Scene was changed, for &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Intent, re&s;olved to re&s;ent the Affront, which &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="57" REF="57">
thought was offered her, in preferring her Si&s;ter's
Company to hers, when we went the above men|tioned
Journey. Being apprized hereof, I com|municated
it the Captain, and de&s;ired him to u&s;e
his Endeavours to repair the Breach, and appea&s;e
the young Lady's &s;eeming Indignation. He at fir&s;t
&s;eemed to &s;light the Affair, as merely trivial and
frivolous, till &s;eeing me very urgent and impor|tunate,
he then promi&s;ed his friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance to
accommodate the &s;eeming Difference, and there|fore
gave the two Si&s;ters and me an Invitation to
&s;up at his Hou&s;e. After Supper, he very genteely,
and with &s;o much Prudence, excu&s;ed both him&s;elf
and me, in the Choice of our Companion to <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI>
that they were both highly plea&s;ed, and were
extreme good Company, particularly Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny,</HI>
who was naturally of a more gay and airy Temper
than her elde&s;t Si&s;ter, and although &s;he had not
the fine&s;t of Faces, yet &s;o graceful was her Air,
&s;o ea&s;y and engaging her Behaviour, and &s;o &s;oft and
alluring her Voice, not &s;trained by Art, but by
the meer Effect of the lavi&s;h Bounty of Nature,
that &s;he captivated the Hearts of all who had the
Plea&s;ure of her Company; upon the Captain's Re|que&s;t,
&s;he favoured us with a Tune on the Spinnet,
and to perfect the Mu&s;ick, joined &s;o melodious a
Voice, that tran&s;ported with Ravi&s;hment and De|light,
I thought my&s;elf in Paradi&s;e. 'Twas then,
that I began to repent my Choice. Mi&s;s <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s
Charms, once &s;o prevalent, now appeared as mere
Phantoms and Illu&s;ions, and <HI>Fanny</HI> reigned &s;ole
Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Affections.</P>
<P>However, as I thought it was not Prudence in
me to di&s;clo&s;e this &s;udden Change, I behaved my|&s;elf
<PB N="58" REF="58">
as one indifferent to her, and in&s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e
amicable Qualifications, that &s;he was perfect Mi|&s;tre&s;s
of. In &s;hort, having paid our Compliments
to our generous Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, I waited on the
Ladies home.</P>
<P>The next Day I began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
would be the Con&s;equence of breaking my Affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
with the Elder, and making my Addre&s;&s;es to the
Younger; when upon mature Deliberation, it ap|peared
to me &s;o vile and &s;candalous an Action, af|ter
&s;uch mutual and &s;olemn A&s;&s;urances of Fidelity
that fearing (as with ju&s;t Rea&s;on I might) that
&s;hould not &s;ucceed in my De&s;ign upon <HI>Fanny,</HI>
fully re&s;olved of the two Evils, to chu&s;e the lea&s;t
and therefore with great Difficulty and Violence to
my&s;elf, I broke off the Intimacy, and after, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HI>King&s;ton upon Thames,</HI> where we u&s;ually drank
hard, and play'd high; and Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> finding
that notwith&s;tanding my Youth, I was Ma&s;ter of
that valuable Art of Secrecy, placed an intire Con|fidence
in me, and made me privy to all his In|trigues
and lawle&s;s Plea&s;ures. This Intimacy of
the Father's gave Birth to the Daughter's Love,
that afterwards proved both her Ruin and mine.
She took all Opportunities of being in my Com|pany,
and frequently &s;taid &s;o late at my Hou&s;e,
without the Leave of her Father and Mother, that
in a little Time it became the publick Talk of the
Neighbours, and almo&s;t the whole Town; and as
Fame is generally attended with Fal&s;hood, &s;ome
there were that &s;crupled not to report, that I was
more familiar with her than was con&s;i&s;tent with the
Mode&s;ty of her Sex; but this Accu&s;ation (I take
God to Witne&s;s) was utterly fal&s;e, for upon my
hearing that her Character and Reputation was &s;o
&s;o gro&s;ly injured, and that tho&s;e malicious A&s;per|&s;ions
aro&s;e from the innocent Pa&s;times with which
we amu&s;ed our&s;elves together, I acquainted my
Neighbour <HI>Brown</HI> with what I heard was current|ly
reported, concerning his Daughter and me, and
furthermore de&s;ired him, as he tendered the Wel|fare
of his Child, to keep her away from my
Hou&s;e; he heartily thanked me for my good
Coun&s;el, and accordingly removed her to her Cou|&s;in
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s at Mile End, where &s;he continued
near three Months, but not without &s;ending me a
Letter or two, to let me know &s;he &s;hould be very
glad to &s;ee me at the Place appointed in the
&s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60">
But I who had no Thoughts of making her my
Wife, out of Friend&s;hip to her Father, &s;corned to
take Advantage of her Youth, nor ever an&s;wered
her Billet-doux, or went according to her Reque&s;t

my intimate and bo&s;om Friend F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> pro|po&s;ed
to take a Hou&s;e on <HI>Epping-fore&s;t,</HI> the Rent

About a Week after, I &s;ent down the Goods ac|cording
to my Promi&s;e, and likewi&s;e for my Part
in the Hou&s;e-warming, a large Ham, and two
Gallons of Brandy. Soon after, my Friend F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">
and I, with &s;ome other merry Blades, went down
to our Country Seat, where we &s;taid three or four
Days. On our Retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, an Accident happened to
me, that had like to have proved very fatal, but I
verified the old Saying, Nought is often in Danger,
but never hurt; for being three Parts mellow, and
mounted on a Golding of great Spirit and Cou|rage,
by my frequent tickling him with the Spur,
he in Spite of all I could do, ran away with me
till I came to Hackney River, where to puni&s;h my
Cour&s;er for his Ob&s;tinacy, and cool his Courage, I
clapped Spurs to him, and plunged him into the

River, down he fell, broke his Knees, and in the
Fall pitched me clear over his Ears, where for
&s;ome Time I could not recover my&s;elf; but by
good Fortune, at length I regained my Legs, and
kept puffing and blowing like a Porpice, till my
Companions came up, and &s;eeing me in that pity|ful
Condition, di&s;patched old <HI>Charon</HI> to take me
up, and waft me to the other Side of the Ferry,
whence like a drowned Rat I went dripping along,
&s;tripped my&s;elf, and got half a Pint of Brandy
made hot, and went to bed, where I lay till my
Shirt and Clothes were dried by the Fire. In the
Evening I ro&s;e, and returned to <HI>London,</HI> and ad|journed
to the old Place of Rendezvous, the Trum|pet
Tavern, in <HI>Sheer Lane,</HI> where we pa&s;&s;ed the
Evening very merrily, but I re&s;olved for the fu|ture
never to be guilty of the like Frolick a|gain.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> thinking that
Ab&s;ence had &s;ufficiently abated the Warmth of his
Daughter's Affections, &s;ent for her home, and I
out of good Manners went to compliment Mi&s;s on
her Return; but alas, her Ab&s;ence had only
&s;erved to &s;mother the amorous Flame, which by
frequent Interviews &s;oon burnt with fiercer Rage.
In fine, one Morning the old Gentlewoman &s;ent
for me to Breakfa&s;t, and then propo&s;ed very advan|tageous
Terms of Marriage with her Daughter,
and urged me to a Compliance with very great
Warmth and Zeal. Furthermore to corroborate
her Argument, down came&punc; Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> with her
Hair di&s;hevel'd, her Eyes flowing with Tears, and
her Dre&s;s carele&s;s and negligent. See, &s;ays the
Mother, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> canting Tone, in what a Pickle poor
<PB N="62" REF="62">
<HI>Nancy</HI> is, how can you be &s;o cruel and hard-hearted,
as not to return her Love? Come, come,
Neighbour Langley, I'll engage you'll have no
Occa&s;ion to repent of your Bargain, Mr. <HI>Browne</HI>
and I &s;hall never have any more Children, and
when we die, you'll come in for ALL. At the
Word ALL, which had a far greater Impre&s;&s;ion on
me than what &s;he had &s;aid before, I pricked up my
Ears, and &s;eemed to hearken to her with Plea&s;ure,
and Nancy, who was before cruelly in the Dumps,
now began to revive, and put on the Air of Joy.
In &s;hort, I told Mrs. Brown, that &s;ince it was an
Affair of &s;uch great Con&s;equence, I mu&s;t de&s;ire a
Month's Time to con&s;ider of it, and that then I
would give her my final An&s;wer. Upon this &s;he
was well &s;atisfied, and I took my Leave of them for
the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now I began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the State of my
Affairs, and finding by the private Accounts that I
kept in my Pocket Book, that the Payment of
tho&s;e &s;everal large Sums borrowed on Jewels of a
con&s;iderable le&s;s Value, than what I had fraudu|lently
pledged them for, was within three Months
of its Expiration: I thought my Circum&s;tances in
a very melancholly Po&s;ture, and my Ca&s;e almo&s;t
de&s;perate, for if I &s;hould not redeem tho&s;e Pledges
pur&s;uant to Contract, my Credit and Reputation
would be entirely lo&s;t; and on the contrary, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

&s;ince I had begun to play the villainous Part, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

<PB N="63" REF="63">
effectually executing what I &s;o fully intended, and
was &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;olved upon. Marriage, I con|&s;idered
with my&s;elf, would not only furni&s;h me
with a pretty Sum of ready Ca&s;h, but would like|wi&s;e
corroborate my Credit, and &s;trengthen my In|tere&s;t.
For as the greate&s;t Villainies are carried on,
and &s;upported by the &s;pecious Pretect of Sanctity
and Di&s;&s;imulation, &s;o I thought it was but a rea&s;on|able
Suppo&s;ition, that the Town now generally ac|quainted
with my frequent Debauches, would upon
my Entrance into the Connubial State, judge me
thereby reclaimed, and become a &s;edate and &s;ober
Man. For this Rea&s;on, &s;ometime before and af|ter
my Marriage, I gave due Attendance at the
Romi&s;h Chapel in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and in a|bout
three Weeks Time I invited Mrs. Brown and
her Daughter to Supper, I told her, that upon a
mature Deliberation of her Propo&s;als, I was willing
to acquie&s;ce and conde&s;cend thereunto, on the fol|lowing
Terms, viz, That Mr. Brown &s;hould be at
the Expence of the Wedding-Clothes, and pay the
&s;tipulated Sum on the Morning of the Wedding|Day,
She readily agreed, and promi&s;ed her Hus|band's
punctual Compliance with my Demands.
Furthermore, as a Surety to bind the Bargain, I
gave the old Gentlewoman a Ring &s;et with Ro&s;e
Diamonds in Form of a Coronet, Nanncy was now
all Life and Gaiety, and by her Parents Approba|tion,
as well as mine, acted the Part of a Mi&s;tre&s;s
in my Hou&s;e, with the &s;ame Freedom and Autho|rity
before, as &s;he did after the Ceremony was per|formed.
But alas, poor Girl, &s;he little thought
how &s;hort her Reign would prove, and how the
Sun&s;hine of her Glory would &s;peedily be darkened

and eclip&s;ed by black impending Clouds that
threatened &s;ure, though not immediate De&s;truction
and endle&s;s Woe. But notwith&s;tanding this En|gagement
and &s;olemn Contract with Nancy, I con|tinued
my lawle&s;s Embraces with Clarinda, whom
I made my Coun&s;ellor and Confidant in the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Tran&s;actions of my Life, and therefore al|though
to &s;atisfy my intended Spou&s;e, and plea&s;e
her Parents, I turned her away &s;oon after Marriage,
yet I frequently kept Company with her after|wards,
and made her &s;everal con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents.
Mrs. Brown immediately purcha&s;ed all Things
&s;uitable for the Wedding, and al&s;o was &s;o very in|dulgent,
as to bring the &s;everal Patterns of Silks
and Laces de&s;igned for Nancy's Parapharnalia, to me
for my Approbation thereof. This Courte&s;y,
and the Richne&s;s of the Dre&s;s, &s;o plea&s;ed me, that
I made her a Pre&s;ent of a Gold Watch and Chain,
and likewi&s;e a brilliant Diamond round-about Ring,
that &s;he might appear in the Fa&s;hion of other mar|ried
Ladies; and now the Licence being taken out,
and all Things ready for the Con&s;ummation of
our Nuptials, Mr. Brown de&s;ired me to &s;ix the
&s;olemn Day, which he &s;aid he &s;hould chu&s;e on that
of his Birth Day. But I declined &s;o &s;peedy an
Execution, on Account of a Tour I had promi&s;ed
to take with &s;ome Friends, to a Gentleman's Seat
in E&s;&s;ex, and de&s;ired the Marriage might be de|&s;erred
for three Weeks longer, which Favour was
ea&s;ily granted. And now all Things being agreed
on, I bethought my&s;elf of a Clergyman of my Ac|quaintance,
a Gentleman void of a Living, and
reduced to a low State, greatly inferior to that of
his Profe&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s he was a boon Com|panion,
<PB N="65" REF="65">
told a merry Tale, and &s;ung a Song with
a good Grace, and by his Indu&s;try made a Shift to
get a red Face in the Service of the Church; for
having given my Word to this Gentleman, that
he &s;hould be my &s;acred Magician, when&s;oever I
altered my Condition of Life, I thought my&s;elf in
Honour bound to perform my Promi&s;e therein. I
therefore &s;ent for him to the Bull Head in Lin|coln's-Inn-Fields,
where over a merry Bottle, I
acquainted the Doctor with my Intent, and en|joyned
him to be ready on the Day appointed for
the Performance thereof. Having thus prepared
the Mini&s;ter, I went down in the Country, and
after a &s;incere and hearty Welcome, returned to
London on the Evening before our appointed
Nuptials, when after having drank a Bottle or two
with the Inn-keeper, where my Hor&s;e &s;tood at
Livery, I went to Mr. <HI>Browne's,</HI> who had pre|pared
a hand&s;ome Supper for my Reception, where
none were pre&s;ent but Captain <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s</HI> Lady and
our Family. After Supper Mr. <HI>Browne</HI> a&s;ked me,
if I was provided with a Clergyman? Yes, Sir,
&s;aid I, and he will be punctual to his Appoint|ment
at <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI> Chapel at Eight in the Morn|ing;
well then, replied he, all's right, for I have
ordered a Coach and Four to be here at Seven, and
after the Ceremony we'll drive to <HI>Tim Harris's</HI> at
<HI>Egham.</HI> Agreed Sir, &s;aid I, &s;o taking my Leave
went home, where, according to Cu&s;tom, I lay
with <HI>Clarinda</HI> all Night. At Six in the Morning I
aro&s;e, and went to my Neighbour <HI>Browne's,</HI> where
they were all very bu&s;y in preparing the new
Bride; he called me a&s;ide, and a&s;ked me whether
<PB N="66" REF="66">
I would have the Ca&s;h before or after Marriage.
Before, Sir, &s;aid I, by all Means; whereupon he
immediately complied with the Contract, by Notes
drawn on Sir <HI>Francis Child,</HI> and likewi&s;e gave me
the Writings of a Hou&s;e belonging to his Daugh|ter,
in <HI>Charles Court</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and afterwards
taking a Bottle of Rum out of his Corner Cup|board,
we drank all Health to each other. Now
the Bride being ready, we drove to the Chapel,
where my good Friend the Doctor was waiting, and
performed his Duty as a Gentleman worthy of his
Profe&s;&s;ion. From Chapel we drove to <HI>Egham,</HI>
where an elegant Dinner was provided at Mr.
<HI>Browne's</HI> Expence, and to u&s;e the Words of the
ingenious Mr. <HI>Phillips,</HI> 'Naught but Mirth and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">Joy around the Table flow'd.' At Four we re|turned
to Town, and I, regardle&s;s of my Spou&s;e,
mounted the Coach-box, and drove to the Queen's
Head Tavern in Holborn, where <HI>Clarinda,</HI> by my
Direction, had ordered a &s;umptuous and elegant
Entertainment to be provided, at which Mr.
<HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">n,</HI> Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">d,</HI> jun. and his Spou&s;e, the
Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, were all pre&s;ent. About Eleven
we adjourned to my Father <HI>Browne's,</HI> where whil&s;t
the Men drank a Bowl of Punch, the Women out
of their pious Care, di&s;hed out the Bride in Bed,
fit for the Reception of her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that we were married on a Thur&s;|day,
and therefore I thought, if I could prevail
on my Wife (who was one of the Church of Eng|land)
to accompany me to Ma&s;s on the Sunday fol|lowing,
I &s;hould thereby gain the Applau&s;e and
E&s;teem of all tho&s;e blinded Zealots. This I con|fe&s;s
I did not attempt out of a religious Motive,
<PB N="67" REF="67">
but from a Thought of private Gain, hoping by
this well feigned Hypocri&s;y, to in&s;inuate my&s;elf
further into the good Graces and E&s;teem of the
mo&s;t eminent and wealthy Followers of that Faith
and Profe&s;&s;ion. My Spou&s;e to oblige me, yielded
to my Reque&s;t, and her Conde&s;cention thereunto
had its de&s;ired Effect; for a Merchant in Ba&s;inghall-&s;treet
&s;ent for me next Day, and commending the
meritorious Act of making a Convert, favoured
me with Nine hundred and Seventy-five Pounds
worth of Silver on my Note, payable in a Month's
Time. This was a great Encouragement to me,
and &s;erved further to facilitate my De&s;ign in run|ning
away as much in Debt as po&s;&s;ibly I could.
Wherefore I re&s;olved to &s;trike while the Iron was
hot, and make as much of my Credit as Time and
Occa&s;ion would permit. For the effectual Per|formance
of which, I took up large Quantities of
Jewels of &s;everal Merchants, under Pretence of
di&s;po&s;ing of them to &s;everal Ladies, whom I had
the Honour to &s;erve, and in three or four Days,
artfully returned them again, telling the Owners,
that the Ladies were not as yet come to a full Re|&s;olution
for the Purcha&s;e of them. I likewi&s;e took
up a Repeating Watch of one Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI> in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI>
the out&s;ide Ca&s;e whereof was &s;et with large
Brilliants of the fir&s;t Water, in Form of a Mari|ner's
Compa&s;s; betwixt the Hours and Minutes
were inter&s;per&s;ed &s;ome Brilliant Sparks, with Ru|bies,
Topazes, and various precious Stones of dif|ferent
Colours, re&s;embling the <HI>Iris.</HI> The Rims of
the Ca&s;e were al&s;o ornamented with co&s;tly Jewels,
imitating the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, and on
the Top of the Spring, that cau&s;es the Movement to
<PB N="68" REF="68">
&s;trike, was &s;et a large Brilliant of the fir&s;t Water,
The Chain was three continued Rows of Diamonds,
and on the Top of the Hook was a very large oval
Brilliant. In &s;hort, it was the riche&s;t and mo&s;t cu|rious
Performance of that Nature, that had been
&s;een in <HI>Europe</HI> at that Time.</P>
<P>This Watch I pretended was de&s;igned for the
Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> and having the Honour to &s;hew
it to &s;everal Noblemen and Ladies of the highe&s;t
Rank, I could have di&s;po&s;ed of it to them; how|ever,
I thought it would turn more to my Advan|tage
to refu&s;e the Sale thereof, for this Rea&s;on, viz.
if I &s;old it in <HI>England,</HI> the Owner would have ex|pected
the Payment thereof in a &s;hort Time, and
on the contrary, it was not rea&s;onable to think that
he would refu&s;e to wait for the Return of foreign
Bills, if it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ent to her <HI>Catho|lick</HI>
Maje&s;ty. And now the Time drawing on for
the Execution of my full Purport, I made it my
Bu&s;ine&s;s to frequent Slaughter's Coffee Hou&s;e in
St. <HI>Martin's Lane,</HI> where I &s;oon got acquainted
with a Set of Foreigners, of whom I enquired into
the Laws and Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e Countries relating
to broken Trade&s;men, that fled thither for Refuge
and Safety, and being a&s;&s;ured by them that <HI>Holland</HI>
was the &s;afe&s;t Azylum to &s;kreen Villanies of that
Nature, I re&s;olved to &s;teer my Cour&s;e thither, and
therefore went to <HI>Bland</HI>'s on Tower Hill, to en|quire
for a Ve&s;&s;el that would be ready to &s;ail in a|bout
a Fortnight's Time. Upon Enquiry, I met
with one <HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">s J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> Commander of the <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI>
Sloop, a Gentleman ob&s;ervant of his Word, if the
Wind and Weather permitted; with this Captain I
agreed for the Pa&s;&s;age of two Per&s;ons, to have the
<PB N="69" REF="69">
Conveniency of his State Room and great Cabbin,
and gave him a Guinea Earne&s;t. The next Thing
I did was to get a Bill of Exchange for five hun|dred
Pounds, in the Name of <HI>Robert Clinton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
payable to nim or Order, which being ea&s;ily ob|tained,
I then applied my&s;elf to the above-menti|oned
Merchants for their Jewels, pretending that
the Ladies were now come to a final Re&s;olution,
and would purcha&s;e them; and now the Prices be|ing
agreed on, I gave them my promi&s;&s;ary Note,
three Months after Date for the &s;ame. All Things
being thus carried on with the utmo&s;t Secrecy, I
appointed <HI>Clarinda,</HI> whom I &s;till kept Company, to
be at the Prince William's Head at <HI>Charing. Cro&s;s.</HI>
She was punctual to my A&s;&s;ignation, and there af|ter
mutual A&s;&s;urances of con&s;tant Love and invi|olable
Friend&s;hip, I acquainted her with my &s;ecret
De&s;ign, and in&s;i&s;ted on her accompanying me in
my Voyage thither, and that upon her Conde&s;cen|&s;ion
thereunto, &s;he &s;hould be an equal Co-partner
and Sharer of my large Fortune, which in all hu|man
Probability, was &s;ufficient for our Mainte|nance,
in a polite and genteel Way, during the
Term of our Lives. But &s;he, like a generous
Girl, declined my ba&s;e Propo&s;als, and in her De|fence,
urged my being already married to a very
de&s;erving young Lady, whom in Honour I could
not leave, and that if &s;he con&s;ented to my Proffer,
&s;he &s;hould thereby de&s;ervedly incur the Scandal of
the mo&s;t vile and abandoned Adultre&s;s. In fine,
all the Arguments I could u&s;e were fruitle&s;s. So
having engaged her religiou&s;ly to keep my im|portant
Secret, I took my Farewel of her; and then
re&s;olved, that &s;ince I could not obtain her con&s;ent,
<PB N="70" REF="70">
that I would take my Wife over with me, which
confe&s;s I did not &s;o much out of pure Love, a
out of a View of Intere&s;t, hoping, that if I &s;hould
be fru&s;trated in my De&s;ign, that her Father, out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Love and Regard to her, would look with a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">vourable
Eye on me, and impute my Mi&s;for+tunes,
or rather ill Management, to the Folly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Youth.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as &s;oon as I came home, I propo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
my wife a country journey on the &s;unday following
and ordered her to get ready, and pack up all he
clothes, my intent being to &s;tay there for three week
or a month. In the mean time I hired a chai&s;e an
four for two days, to be ready at the time appointed
and to prevent my being &s;een, or taken notice of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
pa&s;&s;ing through the city, I ordered the chai&s;e to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

all to the Value of nineteen thou&s;and or twenty thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;and
pounds, in a little trunk, and meeting the cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tain
at Bland's, pur&s;uant to his Appointment, on Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">day
at four in the afternoon, I gave the trunk in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
his cu&s;tody, with a particular charge to lock it up i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
his bureau, and took a receipt for the &s;ame; bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
well a&s;&s;ured by him that he would &s;ail from Grave&s;en
on the monday following. In the evening I went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
my father Brown's, and acquainted him with my pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">tended
journey into the country, with which he &s;eeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
well plea&s;ed, it being the long vacation time. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
morning I gave my journeyman charge of the &s;hop, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
left all my plate &s;tanding therein, lea&s;t the remove
thereof &s;hould cau&s;e a &s;u&s;picion among&s;t my creditor
<PB N="71" REF="71">
and intercept my intended flight. I likewi&s;e ordered
him to pay all &s;uch trivial &s;ums as were owing to my
workmen.</P>
<P>And now my &s;pou&s;e and I having taken leave of
our parents, called a coach, and drove to the above-mentioned
place, where the chai&s;e and four were wait|ing
according to my order. Then di&s;charging the
coach, we went into the King's Arms, and break|fa&s;ted.
From thence we went to Grave&s;end, and put
up at the Faulcon, where I paid two guineas and an
half for the di&s;charge of the chai&s;e according to agree|ment.</P>
<P>On Sunday we dined with the captain, and other
gentlemen and ladies that were going pa&s;&s;engers with
us. On monday morning the captain, according to
his promi&s;e heaved up his anchor with the wind S. W.
All the pa&s;&s;engers with my &s;pou&s;e went on board, but
I &s;taid a&s;hore till the captain went off, which was
nigh an hour after, and now the &s;hip being adrift, lay
to for his coming on board. In the mean time as I was
drinking with my landlord in his back yard fronting the
water, I e&s;pied a one eye game cock, which I pur|cha&s;ed
for half a crown, for a venture in Holland.
Now the captain having completed all his bu&s;ine&s;s a|&s;hore,
hurried me and my new purcha&s;e on board, we
then braced about, filled our held &s;ails, and &s;pread all
the canva&s;s we could to the welcome gale, that fre&s;h|ing
on us, wafted our &s;hip the next day to the Bombkays
at Rotterdam, where we went a&s;hore, and by the
commander's recommendation lodged at the &s;ign of the
Koning Van England, (or King of England's Head)
kept by one John Gadbury, on the Vine Haven.</P>
<P>The next day captain J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> came to dinner with
us, and acquited his charge honourably. Thus all
<PB N="72" REF="72">
things &s;eemed to favour my undertaking, and I being
of a vain and a&s;piring temper, re&s;olved to pa&s;s for the
younger &s;on of my lord F<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and to the end that
I might make an appearance &s;uitable to the dignity
that I had fal&s;ely a&s;&s;umed, I ordered a Taylor to make
me a rich &s;uit of clothes; and as it happened, one Mr.
Loven, a decayed gentleman,, quartered at the &s;ame
inn with me, who &s;peaking the Dutch and French lan|guages
to perfection, with him I contracted to be my
gentleman and interpreter, and to do him ju&s;tice, he
faithfully executed the tru&s;t I repo&s;ed in him. This
gentleman I ordered to hire three French footmen, and
cloth them with the utmo&s;t expedition, with my li|very,
which was blue cloth turned up with red, &s;car|let
wai&s;tcoats and breeches trimmed with &s;ilver, and
broad gold lac'd hats. As to the coach, Mr. Laven
informed me, that it was cu&s;tomary in Holland for
all per&s;ons of quality, except foreign mini&s;ters, to hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
their equipages, as they had occa&s;ion for them, there
being many grand and &s;tately ones kept for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettled my equipage and &s;ervants af|ter
the nice&s;t and riche&s;t fancy, I re&s;olved to devote
my&s;elf to plea&s;ure for &s;ome time; although in the in|terim
I privately enquired for a gentleman of worth
and integrity, to whom I might with &s;afety commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the tru&s;t of my effects, that if peradventure, my cre|ditors
&s;hould come over in que&s;t of me, that they no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
finding any thing valuable in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, might no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
think it worth their while to give them&s;elves any
further trouble about me, but re&s;t contented with
tho&s;e effects I had left in England.</P>
<P><HI>Now I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that upon my return to my
quarters, I frequently found the above-mentioned</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="73">
Captain in Company with my Spou&s;e; how|ever,
I took no Notice thereof, but on the contrary
always entertained him with the utmo&s;t Courte&s;y
and good Manners; but one Night, as we were in
Bed, I a&s;ked her the Meaning of the Captain's fre|quent
Vi&s;its, and whether he endeavoured to &s;hew
a more than lawful Love and Re&s;pect for her.
Hereupon &s;he frankly told me, that &s;he believed
it was the Captain's De&s;ign to betray her Virtue,
for that he often expre&s;&s;ed how pa&s;&s;ionately he
loved her; that therefore &s;he had u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible
Means to avoid his Company, but found it a very
difficult Matter, which gave her cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect,
that he had bribed the Landlady to acquie&s;ce in the
Pur&s;uit of his Amours, wherefore &s;he earne&s;tly
reque&s;ted me to provide fre&s;h Lodgings, where &s;he
might be more retired, and &s;hun the vile Imperti|nence
of the &s;aid Commander: Well plea&s;ed with
this open and generous Confe&s;&s;ion, I highly com|mended
her Honour and Integrity, but de&s;ired that
&s;he would not offer the lea&s;t Affront to the Cap|tain.
I artfuly &s;aid, until I could be further in|formed
of the Puni&s;hments inflicted on Per&s;ons
in Adultery, by the &s;evere Laws of the United
Provinces, Upon con&s;ulting with my Gentleman,
who was well ver&s;ed in Statutes of that Republick,
I found that the Penalty on &s;uch henious Crimes,
was immediate Forfeiture of all the Delinquent's
Effects, and clo&s;e Impri&s;onment during Life, as a
Satisfaction or Atonement to the injured Party, for
the Di&s;honour.</P>
<P>One Day, hearing that there was to be a Cock-fight,
I ordered one of my Servants to prepare
<PB N="82" REF="74">
mine, who had been for &s;ome Time in keeping, to
enter the Li&s;ts, and by my Spou&s;e's earne&s;t En|treaty,
I took her (though contrary to the u&s;ual
Cu&s;tom of the Ladies) with me, to &s;ee the Pa|&s;time.
In &s;hort I backed my Cock again&s;t the
Oppo&s;ers, and he, by good Fortune, at one chance
Blow killed his Antagoni&s;t, by who&s;e unexpected
Death I was a Gainer of about ten Pounds. Highly
plea&s;ed with my Succe&s;s I returned home, and it
being Summer Time we &s;eated our&s;elves under a
&s;hady Tree, that fronted the Inn Door, and called
for a Bottle of Claret, but had not been there long,
before the Captain came and joined us, and being
informed of my good Fortune, wi&s;hed me Joy. I
returned the Compliment, and <HI>Nancy</HI> with an Air
of Gaiety, de&s;ired that I would favour her with the
Winnings for the Purcha&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Toys; I
replied, With all my Heart, my Dear, for this and
all that I have is at your Service, and thereupon
immediately flung the Money into her Lap. Soon
after this, I &s;aw her Countenance change, and ask'd
her what was the Matter? but &s;he made me no
An&s;wer, whereupon Madam, &s;aid I, what are you
dumb? This ra&s;h and ha&s;ty Expre&s;&s;ion &s;o nettled
her, that &s;he threw the Money into the Street,
which I knowing the Value of better than &s;he, ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and picked it up, &s;wearing, that &s;ince &s;he had
abu&s;ed my Genero&s;ity, I would give her &s;ufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
Rea&s;on to repent it; but my Pa&s;&s;ion was over, and
by Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Mediation, I promi&s;ed to forgive
and forget that &s;illy Flight of Youth.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Captain propo&s;ed a Tour to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>Hague,</HI> which was with Plea&s;ure agreed to, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

of Nobility, where we dined in a &s;umptuous
and elegant Manner, at the Sign of the <HI>Engli&s;h
Parliament,</HI> a celebrated Hou&s;e for polite Entertain|ment.
From whence we returned to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
where I entertained the Captain and &s;ome of the
other Gentlemen with a grand Entertainment;
when the Company was gone, I u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible
Arguments to per&s;wade <HI>Nancy</HI> to yield a &s;eeming
compliance to the Captain's lawle&s;s De&s;ires, and to
appoint him pur&s;uant to my Direction, a Place
proper for the Execution of his villainous De&s;ign.
Furthermore, I urged the great Advantage accru|ing
from thence, and the diligent care and caution
I would take to &s;urprize him, bla&s;ted in the fruit|le&s;s
Expectations of &s;atiating his luxuriant and adul|terous
Pa&s;&s;ion. But notwith&s;tanding all my Argu|ments,
<HI>Nancy</HI> remained inflexible, and could not
be induced to acquie&s;ce to this treacherous Propo|&s;al,
and in her Defence urged, that no Lucre or
&s;ordid Gain (though ever &s;o great) could expiate or
atone for that Di&s;honour and Lo&s;s of Character,
that &s;he mu&s;t inevitably &s;u&s;tain, by conde&s;cending
to &s;o infamous an Act; wherefore I thought pro|per
to drop an Argument &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing and un|grateful
to her, and to proceed to an Affair far
more weighty and important, viz. the Security of
my Per&s;on and Effects.</P>
<P>For the effectual Performance of which, being
recommended to Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, a Man of Worth
and experienced Fidelity, that kept a large Ware|hou&s;e
on the <HI>Bombkays,</HI> to him I committed the
Charge of my Ca&s;h and Jewels; and now finding
by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he was well ver&s;ed in the
Laws of that Republick, and more particular in
<PB N="84" REF="76">
tho&s;e relating to broken Trade&s;men that took
Sanctuary in tho&s;e Parts, him I judged to be the
propere&s;t Per&s;on to con&s;ult and communicate with
about my own Affairs. Neverthele&s;s I was not &s;o ra&s;h
as to let him into the Secret of my Circum|&s;tances
at the fir&s;t Interview, but taking a Note of
him for the Re-delivery of my Ca&s;h and Effects on
demand, I parted with him for the pre&s;ent, and
as &s;oon as I came home, enquired more &s;trictly of
my Landlord, into his Character and Repute. Mr.
<HI>Gadbury,</HI> my Ho&s;t, &s;crupled not to expatiate
largely on his undoubted Veracity, and unbia&s;&s;ed
Fidelity to his Tru&s;t, and at the &s;ame Time nomi|nated
&s;everal Gentlemen, who&s;e Affairs were then
in a melancholly and dangerous Po&s;ture, that by
his Prudence and Sagacity, had been re-in&s;tated in
their pri&s;tine Glory.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words uttered with &s;o much Warmth and
Ardour, ea&s;ily induced me to a Belief, that Mr.
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> was in Reality de&s;erving of &s;o great a Cha|racter,
and therefore I engaged him to dine with
me the next Day at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and without Re|&s;erve
I unbo&s;omed my&s;elf to him in a frank and
friendly Manner. Hereupon he promi&s;ed to be
&s;teadfa&s;t, and true to my Intere&s;t, and advi&s;ed me
immediately to procure a Protection from the
States General, which he a&s;&s;ured me, would totally
exempt me from the Juri&s;diction of any other Fo|reign
Laws; and as a farther Proof of his Since|rity,
he promi&s;ed by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Lawyer,
(his particular Friend) to obtain what he &s;o hear|tily
wi&s;hed, as well for my Security as his own Sa|tisfaction,
that I were now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. More|over
added he, it mu&s;t be done with the utmo&s;t

<P>Charmed with his Di&s;cour&s;e, that in&s;pired me
with new Life and Vigour, and bani&s;hed the gloo|my

pre&s;&s;ed him to a &s;peedy Execution of his Promi&s;e,

Air of Gaiety &s;aid, Sir, I wi&s;h you Joy, of what
replied I? Of your &s;o much de&s;ired Protection,

<P>I now rambled up and down without Fear or

Scarce had I read the Letter, before I was alarm'd
with a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e in the Street; whereupon my

Zounds&punc; Sir, you are taken, my Hou&s;e is now &s;ur|rounded.
Be calm, Sir, &s;aid I, and &s;end up one
of your <HI>Dutch</HI> Servants to me, I'll change Habits
with him; al&s;o let me have a lighted Candle and a

Orders, I &s;tript, put on <HI>Mynheer</HI>'s Habit, black'd
my Eye-brows, and pa&s;&s;ed out at the back Door,
unob&s;erved by any; from thence I went into the
Weod, where I lay hid until the Time appointed,
when Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> came, highly overjoyed to find
me e&s;caped from the Fury of my Adver&s;aries.
Come, Sir, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t now per&s;onate the

Place, of ten miles in Circumference, where I will
obtain for you the Governor's Protection, and there
you may live &s;ecure and free from all Mole&s;tations

than with Plea&s;ure agreed to, &s;o from the Wood
we went into the next Town, and there hired a
Phaeton or Chai&s;e for <HI>Vienna.</HI> In the Evening we
arrived there, and the next Morning waited on the
Governor, of whom for 50 Guineas I received the
Favour of a Protection, with a &s;trict Charge and
Caution not to exceed the Bounds of his Minute
Territories.</P>
<P>The next Day Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> took his Leave of

I enjoy'd all Plea&s;ures, that a Place inhabited by
unfortunate Per&s;ons cou'd afford, this being
but a living Goal in Epitome. However, hav|ing
<PB N="81" REF="83">
a &s;ufficiency of Ca&s;h, the Honour and Re|&s;pect
I met with there, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure alleviated
the Hard&s;hip of my Confinement. Here I be|came
acquainted with two Iri&s;h young Fellows, of
daring and bold Di&s;po&s;itions, who had here taken
Refuge and Sanctuary for Murder, no Crime be|ing
reckon'd &s;ufficiently black or infamous, to ex|clude
the vile Offenders from the Graces and Pro|tection

Expences, and they, as the only Satisfaction that
they could make, faithfully promi&s;ed at the Ha|zard
of their Lives, to &s;ecure me from all In&s;ults
and Dangers.</P>
<P>Hither came Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> pur&s;uant to his Pro|mi&s;e,
Weekly, and &s;upplied me with what Ca&s;h I
demanded, and a&s;&s;ured me, that my Creditors be|gan
to be out of all Hopes, and that if I patiently
&s;ubmitted to my Confinement for a &s;hort Time,
that they would &s;oon be wearied out, with the
large and extravagant Charges they were at, in
their vain Search and fruitle&s;s Pur&s;uit. Whereup|on
I charged him to make my Wife as ea&s;y as he
po&s;&s;ibly could, and let her know, that as &s;oon as
the Storm was over, I would pay her a Vi&s;it&punc; but
at the &s;ame Time, cautioned him not to let her
into the Secret of my Abode, lea&s;t peradventure,
thro' the Folly and indi&s;cretion of Youth, &s;he
&s;hould inadvertently blab it out. <HI>Nancy,</HI> I mu&s;t
ob&s;erve to you, had near upon four hundred
Pounds by her, be&s;ides her Jewels, Gold Watch,
and Snuff Box, &s;o that I knew &s;he could not be in
<PB N="82" REF="84">
any Want, and therefore made my&s;elf ea&s;y on that
Head.</P>
<P>During my Stay here, I was taken violently ill,
which prevented my intended Journey to his <HI>Pru&s;|&s;ian</HI>
Maje&s;ty's Dominions, whither I had de&s;igned
to go, and by pre&s;enting my &s;o-much&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">amed and
celebrated Watch to his then favourite Lady, flat|tered
my&s;elf with the Hopes of obtaining a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
in that great Monarch's Service. Dr.
W<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was my Phy&s;ician, who lived contiguous
to the Hou&s;e where I lodged, and three Times a
Day vi&s;ited me, lying in a dangerous Condition in
my Bed, not able to move either Hand or Foot,
but racked with tormenting Pains both Night and
Day. My faithful <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> con&s;tantly attended
me, and for my Security brought Fire Arms into
my Room, lea&s;t the Governor being influenced by
a larger Sum, or &s;ollicited by their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es,
&s;hould cancel or &s;upercede my Protection,
and thereby expo&s;e me to the free Arre&s;t and Fu|ry
of my Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>One Night as I lay in my Bed, two of my Cre|ditors
came and &s;urprized me in my Room, and
in&s;i&s;ted on my going with them immediately&punc; pro|ducing
the Governor's Order to compel me to ac|quie&s;ce
to their Demands; but I excu&s;ed my&s;elf
on Account of my Illne&s;s for that Night, and pro|mi&s;ed
to be ready in the Morning, to comply with
their Reque&s;t. Neverthele&s;s this An&s;wer, was not
Satisfactory, for they in&s;i&s;ted on lying in the &s;ame
Room with me, as a Guard to my Per&s;on. Here
upon my Comrades armed them&s;elves with a Brac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of Pi&s;tols each, and pre&s;enting, &s;wore, that if the
Gentlemen did not immediately depart, that they
<PB N="83" REF="85">
would &s;everely puni&s;h their Ra&s;hne&s;s and In&s;olence,
for they in&s;i&s;ted on that Room being their Pro|perty;
and that I was only there on Sufference.
Hereupon the Creditors withdrew, but placed a
Guard round the Hou&s;e, &s;wearing that they would
hurry me away with them very early in the Mor|ning.</P>
<P>Now the Fright I was in di&s;pelled all my Pain,
and I, who before could not move my&s;elf in my
Bed, now put on my Cloaths, and walked ha&s;tily
up and down the Room, ruminating what Cour&s;e
to take to extricate my&s;elf from this Emergency.
At la&s;t I &s;ent for the Doctor, who had already heard
of the Affair, and with him I agreed, that if he
would leave open his back Door, between the
Hours of Twelve and One, I would make my
E&s;cape, and take Shelter in his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e he readily con&s;ented, and pro|mi&s;ed
to be punctual in the Execution of his
Tru&s;t. Whereupon my Companions and I called
for Liquor plentifully, and I &s;eemed to be no ways
concerned at the Danger I was in,</P>
<P>Now the Time of my intended Flight drawing
nigh; we called for a large Bowl of Arrack Punch,
which whil&s;t the Landlady, (the &s;ole Per&s;on then
&s;tirring in the Hou&s;e) was making, I by the Fa|vour
and Ob&s;curity of the Night, e&s;caped out at
the back Door, and &s;lipped un&s;een into the Doc|tor's
Hou&s;e, where I lay concealed for nine or ten
Days, leaving my Pur&s;uers to cur&s;e their unhappy
Stars, and commence a fre&s;h Hunt after their flown
Game,</P>
<P>At length, growing weary of this intolerable con|finement,
I re&s;olved to venture abroad in di&s;gui&s;e, and
<PB N="84" REF="86">
therefore borrowed a &s;uit of woman's apparel of the
Doctor's &s;pou&s;e, in return for which I gave her a di|amond
girdle Buckle. The dre&s;s I had was <HI>French,</HI>
and therefore I was now obliged to play the part of
<HI>Madam de Paris,</HI> and for two or three days behav'd
very mode&s;tly among the ladies, being in&s;tructed in my
female di&s;cipline by the Doctor's &s;pou&s;e. At la&s;t I &s;et
out for <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> having a gentleman of the Doc|tor's
recommendation to per&s;onate my Husband; as
&s;oon as I arrived there, I wrote to Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, de|&s;iring
him to remit me 200 Guineas, but he never
complied with my demand.</P>
<P>Three days afterwards I received a letter from an
uuknown hand, a&s;&s;uring me that my Partner H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had
proved fal&s;e, and betray'd his Tru&s;t to me; for
that he had actually agreed to deliver up all my ef|fects,
on promi&s;e of the above-mentioned reward;
that therefore the only expedient I had left to prevent
his villainous de&s;ign was, a voluntary &s;urrender of
my&s;elf. Whereupon, as the old &s;aying is, Needs mu&s;t
when the devil drives, I determined to make the be&s;t
of my way to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where I heard that my
creditors were a&s;&s;embled at Mr. E<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, at the
Sun on the <HI>Vine-Haven,</HI> and by a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
to their mercy and clemency, to appea&s;e their ju&s;t
indignation, and thereby obtain that Reward that my
partner had by &s;o infamous and treacherous a plot, en|deavoured
to gain.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign happily had its de&s;ired Effect, for upon
my free &s;urrender, the creditors not only u&s;ed me in a
generous and gentleman-like manner, but &s;ent for Mr.
<HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> and ab&s;olutely demanded all tho&s;e effects
that&punc; I had lodged in his hands, threat'ning upon re|fu&s;al
thereof, to &s;eize them by authority. In &s;hort&punc;
<PB N="85" REF="87">
he was obliged to comply, and produced all that eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
I had committed to his tru&s;t, and at the &s;ame time
brought in a charge again&s;t me for ca&s;h drawn out of
his hands, as likewi&s;e his bill for attendance and &s;er|vices
done for me, whil&s;t under my Misfortunes. The
gentlemen, as well as I, were greatly amazed at his
exorbitant demands, which were upwards of 700 l.
but neverthele&s;s, to avoid further trouble and ex|pences,
they were advi&s;ed to acquie&s;ce to his exactions;
the laws of the united provinces being &s;trictly &s;evere
in compelling all per&s;ons to &s;atisfy the parties by them
employed, to the utmo&s;t of their demands, tho' never
&s;o immoderate. And now as a gratuity, the credi|tors
gave me the &s;um of 200 <HI>l.</HI> enjoining me to be
ready to &s;ail with them for <HI>England</HI> on the fir&s;t op|portunity.</P>
<P>Matters being thus accommodated, I went to my
old landlord's at the King's Head, but to my &s;urprize,
&s;ound that my wife was gone from thence, at the in|&s;tigation
of the above-mentioned <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> who
had ba&s;ely per&s;uaded her to make a tour to <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he &s;aid I was &s;ettled. Upon a
further enquiry about her effects, the landlord told
me, that &s;he had honourably di&s;charged the hou&s;e,
and took her trunk along with her. However, I
made my&s;elf as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, under my unfortunate
circum&s;tances, but vowed to revenge my&s;elf on <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI>
for the injury and inju&s;tice he had done me; and there|fore,
I privately bought a pair of pocket pi&s;tols, load|ed
them, and then went to his hou&s;e to drink a gla&s;s
with him, under pretence of accommodating our dif|ferences,
tho' my full and real intent was to have
&s;hot him, as an example to deter others from violating
the &s;acred ties of friend&s;hip, by the horrid and &s;canda|lous
<PB N="86" REF="88">
breach of tru&s;t. But he (unable to bear the
reproaches of the populace) was gone, and &s;o pre&s;erv'd
his own life, as well as mine, which would have been
inevitably forfeited to the ju&s;t laws of the Republic,
&s;everely rigid again&s;t homicide.</P>
<P>Soon after this, my creditors and I returned for
<HI>England.</HI> On our arrival at <HI>London,</HI> we went to
Mr. <HI>Barnes</HI>'s, a gold&s;mith on <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> and one
of my principal creditors, who was generon&s;ly plea&s;ed
to treat me better than I de&s;erved; at this gentle|man's
hou&s;e I lay all night, and the next morning was
carried to the Crown and Rolls Tavern in <HI>Chancery
Lane,</HI> where the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Bankruptcy
were a&s;&s;embled; here to my &s;urprize, I met with my
wife and mother-in-law, both dre&s;&s;ed in mourning, for
the death of their relation capt. <HI>Holden</HI>; when after
a civil &s;alute, the old gentlewoman &s;aid, <HI>Ah! Mr.</HI>
Langley, <HI>this Dre&s;s well becomes our pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances,
for we are all ruin'd by your Folly.
Mr.</HI> Brown <HI>raves like a Madam, and will by no
Means be pacified, and</HI> Nancy's Dutch <HI>Landlord
has ran away with all her Ca&s;h, Cloaths, and Jew|els,
whil&s;t &s;he was in Que&s;t of you.</HI> Our further
di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by an order from the commi&s;|&s;ioners
for me to attend them immediately; where af|ter
a long and &s;trict examination pa&s;&s;ed, to the con|tent
of all parties, I was di&s;charged, upon promi&s;e
of giving due attendance to the attorney for the com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and one of the a&s;&s;ignees for my encouragement
thereunto, gave me five guineas in hand. After this,
I took an apartment for my&s;elf and wife, in <HI>Devercux
Court,</HI> near <HI>Temple Bar,</HI> and daily wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted on the
a&s;&s;ignees and their attorney, for the execution of the
then dependant bu&s;ine&s;s, viz. to &s;ettle my affairs, and
<PB N="87" REF="89">
cell in my debts, which were large, there being up|wards
of eighteen hundred pounds in the book, and my
plate and hou&s;hold furniture was &s;old for upwards of
twelve hundred pounds more. But among&s;t all my
misfortunes, none &s;o much grieved me as to &s;ee my cu|rious
library of books, that with pains I purcha&s;ed
for two hundred and fifty pounds, di&s;po&s;ed of for
the trivial &s;um of thirty pounds. And now my wife
being taken very ill, was removed to her mother's,
to be attended with all nece&s;&s;ary care for a &s;ick per&s;on;
whereupon finding 5 s. per week too much for my fallen
circum&s;tances, to pay for a room barely to &s;leep in, I
di&s;charged the &s;ame, and took another at 1 s. 6 d. per
week in <HI>Hemlock Court.</HI></P>
<P>During the indi&s;po&s;ition of my &s;pou&s;e, I was not
permitted to &s;ee her, being &s;trictly forbid the hou&s;e by
her father. Wherefore having now &s;ettled the book
debts, and given an account of the re&s;pective abodes of
the different creditors, I re&s;olved to &s;eek my fortune
abroad, hoping that upon my return, I &s;hould find my
affairs happily concluded, and my&s;elf thereby ma&s;ter of
a great &s;um ari&s;ing from the Statute. Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI>
u&s;ed her utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;&s;uade me from my pur|po&s;e;
but I remained inflexible, and deaf to all her
earne&s;t entreaties, and therefore mu&s;tering up the &s;um
of thirty Guineas, I went to the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Coffee|hou&s;e,
where I agreed with captain <HI>Jo&s;eph Richard|&s;on,</HI>
commander of the <HI>Frere</HI> Galley, bound for the a|bove-mentioned
i&s;land, for my pa&s;&s;age thither. Upon

de&s;titute of either Money or Friends; however, I
amu&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;ettling the Accounts of one
Mr. <HI>Morgan,</HI> a yearly Trader to tho&s;e Parts, and
knowing no other Antidote to my pre&s;ent Afflicti|ons
but Patience, I determined to bear up again&s;t
the Torrent of Adver&s;ity, with a chearful Alcrity,
and plea&s;ing Hopes of &s;ome unectxpeed Turn of
Fortune.</P>
<P>On <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day we went a&s;hore, and the
Ship's Doctor invited me to Dinner with him at a
Friend's Hou&s;e, for every one by my Apparel,
judged me to be a young Gentleman of Fortune.
In the Evening I went to Mrs. <HI>Carmichael's,</HI> the
be&s;t Tavern in <HI>Charles Town,</HI> where I quartered for
a con&s;iderable Time; my good Friend Mr. <HI>Mor|gan</HI>
having given me a fair Character to my Land|lady,
and al&s;o pre&s;ented me with two Moidores,
for the Service I had done him, in &s;ettling his
Accounts; but this ready Ca&s;h was &s;oon expend|ed,
and I con&s;iderably indebted to my kind Ho|&s;te&s;s,
which threw me in &s;o a great Dilemma how
to manage my Affairs, that I could neither re&s;t
Night nor Day; full well I knew that I could not
get off from the I&s;land without giving public No|tice
thereof for one and twenty Days. Neverthe|le&s;s,
as I had artfully lodged my Che&s;t and Appa|rel
at a little Tavern adjoining to the Water-&s;ide, I
waited in Hopes of &s;ome favourable Opportunity
of bilking my Landlady. Accordingly, &s;ome
Time afterwards his Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Go&s;port,</HI> ar|rived
in the Bay, and by good Fortune, &s;ome of
the young Officers came to Dinner at my Quar|ters,
where in the Afternoon, over a merry Bottle,
one of the Gentlemen a&s;ked me, if I was not a
<PB N="90" REF="92">
Commander, of &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el, for &s;o he judged me
to be my Apparel, which was Scarlet trimm'd with
Silver. Sir, &s;aid I, my Appearance, I confe&s;s,
may &s;peak me to be &s;uch as you plea&s;e to imagine,
but to tell you the real Truth, I am the mo&s;t un|fortunate
young Fellow alive, for here I am in|volv'd
in Debt, which I am unable to di&s;charge,
neither know I how to e&s;cape from this accur&s;ed
I&s;land. Sir, replied he bri&s;kly, If that be all your
Grievance, I'll put you in a Way to redre&s;s it im|mediately;
our Captain is an honourable and good-natured
Gentleman, and therefore, if you apply to
him for your Pa&s;&s;age, to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I doubt not but
that he will ea&s;ily grant your Reque&s;t; he comes
a&s;hore every Morning about Nine, and your be&s;t
Way is, to addre&s;s your&s;elf to him on his Land|ing,
before he is engaged in other Company; in
the mean Time, be cautious how you let any one
into the Secret, and you need not fear Succe&s;s
therein. In fine, I heartily thanked him for his
whole&s;ome and highly agreeable Advice, and the
next Morning met the Commander, to whom I
freely without Re&s;erve, made known the State of
my Affairs, and he as generou&s;ly was plea&s;ed to
promi&s;e me my Pa&s;&s;age on Board the Ship, and at
the &s;ame Time, as a Signal, ordered me, when I
&s;aw his Maintop &s;ail Sheets hauld home, to come
on Board, and he would receive me into his Care
and Protection.</P>
<P>Highly plea&s;ed with this unexpected Courte&s;y
from a Stranger, I was not failing in an humble
and grateful Acknowledgement of &s;o &s;ingular a
Favour, and elate with Joy, returned to my Quar|ters.
Now my &s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep a &s;harp
<PB N="91" REF="93">
look-out for my &s;o much de&s;ired Signal; which
on the fourth Day I e&s;pied, to my great Joy and
Comfort; whereupon, I directly took a Canoe,
put my Che&s;t therein, and went on Board. Captain
<HI>Richard&s;on</HI> &s;eeing me go on board the Man of
War, imagined how Affairs went, and &s;ent his
Mate to me, with three Guineas, for the Whig
which I had had of my afore&s;aid Friend the Barber
at <HI>Blackwall.</HI> From <HI>Barbadoes</HI> we &s;ailed to <HI>Ja|maica,</HI>
and during the Pa&s;&s;age, I had the Honour
to Me&s;s with the Lieutenats, who &s;eemed well
plea&s;ed at the merry Recital of my various Adven|tures.
I leave my Readers to judge of the Confu|&s;ion
that my Landlady was in, at the News of my
&s;udden Departure, and now proceed to the Relation
of what happened to me in the above-mentioned
I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>I lodged at Mr. <HI>Wade's</HI> at <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and by
my coming there in the Man of War, pa&s;&s;ed cur|rently
for one of the Mid&s;hipmen. Here in a &s;hort
Time I expended my &s;mall Stock, but was happily
prevented from running in Debt, by an unexpected
Accident. For one Night being at Supper with
&s;ome Gentlemen of the I&s;land, one of the Company
gave me a kind Invitation to come over to his Plan|tation,
near <HI>Salt-pan-Hill,</HI> there to &s;pend three
Weeks or a Month with him in a retired Life. I
readily embraced the Opportunity, as hoping there|by
to gain the Favour of being recommended to
&s;ome Employment on the I&s;land. The next Day
we went to his Country Seat, far more re&s;embling
the infernal Regions, than the plea&s;ing Abode of a
Mortal here on Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
His numerous Attendants, both Male and Fe|male,
were all Black, and their young, like Swine,
lay groveling in the Du&s;t. Here the parched and
yawning Earth brought to my Remembrance, how
Dame <HI>Tullis</HI> rai&s;ed up her barren Head, invoking
<HI>Jove</HI> to cru&s;h the giddy <HI>Phaeton</HI> in his wild and
mad Carreer, and by his de&s;erved fall, to &s;ave her
va&s;t Dominions from an univer&s;al Conflagration.
As this Gentleman had no <HI>European</HI> but my&s;elf to
Conver&s;e, I &s;oon became familiar with him, who
being acquainted with my Circum&s;tances, promis'd
to &s;erve me to the utmo&s;t of his Capacity, Al|though
I here enjoyed all that the I&s;land afforded,
yet a retired Life was not agreeable to my own
Di&s;po&s;ition; and therefore, I re&s;olved to u&s;e &s;ome
Stratagem to get a little Ca&s;h of him, and then go
on board the Fleet commanded by Admiral <HI>Stew|ard.</HI>
To effect this, I propo&s;ed to live with this
Gentleman as his Servant or Over&s;eer, which Fa|vour
after many Solicitations, and earne&s;t Entrea|ties
was granted, and my de&s;igned Employment
was to overlook the Negroes in the Fi&s;hery. Now
as &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Lynch</HI> (for that was the Gentleman's
Name) and I, had agreed on Terms for my Wages,
I freely told him, that my Che&s;t and Cloaths lay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
as a Security for twenty Dollars at Port Royal, and
I mo&s;t humbly entreated him to advance me Mo|ney
for the Redemption of the &s;ame; to which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
readily con&s;ented, and ordered his Negroes t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Royal, and there wait till I had compleated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I landed there, but I took one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
the Slaves with me to a Tavern, and there gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="93" REF="95">
him a Letter to carry to his Ma&s;ter, the Contents
whereof were, 'That I returned him many Thanks
for his kind Entertainment, and generous A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance;
but that Fortune had unexpectedly provid|ed
&s;omething for me far &s;uperior to the Station
of a Servant; that I hoped he would excu&s;e my
Breach of Promi&s;e, and that as to the Ca&s;h, that
he had lent me, I would repay him as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible.' Having thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Negroe, I
forthwith addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the afore&s;aid Admi|ral,
who generou&s;ly compa&s;&s;ionating my Youth,
and Misfortunes, was plea&s;ed to order me on board
the &s;ame Ship that brought me thither, and the
Commander thereof, favoured me with the Liberty
of walking the Quarter Deck. In three or four
Days, the Fleet &s;ailed round for Port Antonio, &s;i|tuate
on the Northermo&s;t Part of the I&s;land, where
we continued near four Months, all Hands being
daily employed A&s;hore, in building a Dock for his
Maje&s;ty's Service. From whence we returned to
Port Royal, and after a &s;hort &s;tay there, our Ship
was ordered home to Plymouth, and there, &s;oon
after paid off. Whil&s;t I was on board, I had con|tracted
an Intimacy with the Surgeon's Mate, and
we two now became in&s;eparable Companions, we
both lodging at the Three Guns at the Dock. A|mid&s;t
the various Company that re&s;orted thither,
was an old Gentleman, Clerk of the Dock Yard, a
Man of an affable and engaging Temper, with
whom, as he daily frequented the Hou&s;e, we &s;oon
became acquainted. This Gentleman had a very
agreeable young Lady for his Daughter, with
whom, as &s;he accidentally came to call her Father
Home, my Comrade, the Doctor, was &s;o &s;mitten
<PB N="94" REF="96">
at the fir&s;t Sight, that he could not re&s;t, till he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Company, to Supper on the following Evening
Mr. B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">, (for that was the Gentleman's Name

Mirth and Gaiety; the young Lady to heighter
our Plea&s;ures, diverting us with &s;everal Songs
Between Twelve and One we waited on our Com|pany
Home, and afterwards returned to our Quar|ters,
where the Doctor was now more inflamed, his
Thoughts and Di&s;cour&s;e running continually on
the Perfections of his new Mi&s;tre&s;s. But, for my
Part, I concealed my ardent Pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;olved
to wait a more favourable Opportunity, of di&s;|clo&s;ing
my Love and E&s;teem, in an honourable
Manner, if &s;o it may be called in me, who had al|ready
tied the Conjugal Knot. In the mean Time,
the Doctor and I (being both flu&s;h with Money) re|velled
at large, till by our repeated Extravagan|cies,
we had almo&s;t drained our Pockets, and in
return to our Folly, got the <HI>French</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>However, one Day as we were playing at Bil|liards,
I looking out of the Window, accidentally
&s;aw my Charmer &s;tanding at the Door of a Corner
Shop; whereupon, giving the Game for lo&s;t, Doc|tor,
&s;aid I, there's Molly, come, let's go and drink
a Di&s;h of Tea with her; by no Means, replied he,
for the People of the Hou&s;e are Strangers, and
con&s;equently would deem it Impudence in us to
force any Acquaintance with them. No matter
for that quoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, if you won't go, I will; &s;o down
Stairs I ran to the Shop, and (as in a Surprize)
&s;aid, Ble&s;s me, Madam! what good Fortune has
brought you hither, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">'ve oftentimes promi&s;ed my|&s;elf
<PB N="95" REF="97">
the Happine&s;s of drinking Tea with you, but
never till now had the Opportunity; &s;o &s;lipping
into the Shop, I told the Mi&s;tre&s;s thereof, that I
hoped &s;he would excu&s;e my Freedom, in de&s;iring
the favour of her to make a Pot of Tea, and at the
&s;ame Time flung down Half a Crown as a Satis|faction
for her Trouble.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed to have the Op|portunity
of obliging her Cou&s;in, as &s;he called her,
and me, and therefore de&s;ired us to walk into the
Parlour, whil&s;t &s;he prepared the Tea Equipage.
Here I freely di&s;clo&s;ed my Mind to my lovely God|de&s;s,
and met with a more favourable Reception
than I expected: &s;oon after, in came the old Gen|tleman,
who merrily &s;aid, So, &s;o, Mr. <HI>Englefield,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
&s;ee that <HI>Molly</HI> and you are got together. Yes, Sir,
&s;aid I, and &s;ince I have had the Plea&s;ure of
drinking Tea with Mi&s;s, I de&s;ire the Favour that
we may now go and drink a Gla&s;s together, for
I've &s;omething to impart to you of great Con&s;e|quence.
Agreed to, Sir, replyed he, and you and
I will go fir&s;t, and <HI>Molly,</HI> if &s;he plea&s;es, may fol|low
after us. In &s;hort, I told the old Gentleman
how pa&s;&s;ionately I loved his Daughter, and that I
&s;hould be proud to make her my Wife: Whil&s;t we
were thus di&s;cour&s;ing, <HI>Molly</HI> came to us, where|upon
I &s;hewed all po&s;&s;ible Marks of &s;incere Love
and E&s;teem for her in the Pre&s;ence of her Father,
who invited me to breakfa&s;t with him next Mor|ning.
All this Time, my good Friend, the Doc|tor,
was on Thorns, and longed to know the Re&s;ult
of our long Conferences, which I told him was
on various Subjects, but never mentioned that I
had made the lea&s;t Pro&s;&s;er of Love to <HI>Molly,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

that I repeated my Addre&s;&s;es, and pa&s;&s;ionately

con&s;ummate our Happine&s;s by his con&s;ent; to
which he generou&s;ly replied, &s;ince my Daughter
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> willing, I am content. Whereupon we went in
to breakfa&s;t, and all my de&s;ires being<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> thus hap|pily
accompli&s;hed, I took my Leave for the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came to my Lodgings, I began
&s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on my pa&s;t Folly in engaging
my&s;elf in &s;o &s;olemn and important an Affair, with|out
any Probability of effecting what I had &s;eem|ingly
carried on with &s;o much Succe&s;s; the &s;ole
Rea&s;on whereof was owing to my Imprudence;
for although I made a gay Appearance, yet I had
but ten Shillings le&s;t in Money, and moreover was
&s;everely pepper'd by the Favours of a Mi&s;s I had
met with at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Wherefore on mature De|liberation,
of the Con&s;equences that mu&s;t inevita|bly
ari&s;e from the Con&s;umption of my intended
Nuptials, I determined to vi&s;it her once more, to
let her know, that, that I had received an Ordor
from my Friends to repair to London forthwith,
on &s;ome urgent Affair; but that upon the Con|clu&s;ion
<PB N="97" REF="99">
thereof, I would return, and honourably
perform my promi&s;e. <HI>Molly</HI> &s;eemed well enough
plea&s;ed herewith, but in&s;i&s;ted on knowing how to
write to me, whereupon I told her to direct to
the <HI>Gun</HI> Tavern at <HI>Billing&s;gate.</HI> Now there be|ing
a Sloop ready to &s;ail that Day for <HI>London,</HI> my
Friend the Doctor and I, embark'd therein, and
landed at <HI>Tower</HI> Stairs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I then did, was to &s;end for Mr.
<HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">e,</HI> to whom I related my Adventures, and
of him enquired into the State of the Bankruptcy:
Hereupon he told me, that Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">n,</HI> and the
A&s;&s;ignees, were involved in Law, and that no
Dividend had as yet been made, but &s;ays he, I
have two Guineas for you, that was le&s;t by your
worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Gilpin,</HI> which I &s;hould have
&s;ent to you on board the Ship that you went out
in, had I not heard that &s;he was &s;ailed before I
could po&s;&s;ibly remit them to you. Mr. <HI>Brown</HI>
has &s;ent your Wife to board in the North of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
but as to the particular Place I can't inform
you. I would therefore now advi&s;e you to lodge
privately on <HI>Southwark</HI> Side, where if you &s;end
me a Direction, I will &s;ometimes call and &s;ee you.
Hereupon I took my leave of him, and went in
&s;earch of an Apartment, which by good Fortune
I &s;oon met with, agreeable to my Ta&s;te, it being
in a Publick Hou&s;e, where I had the Room <HI>Gra|tis.</HI>
Near unto my Man&s;ion lived a Mantua|maker
and her Daughter who I be&s;ieged &s;o clo&s;ely,
that in a little Time her Virtue began to &s;tagger,
and her Concupi&s;cence to be a Tiptoe. In &s;hort,
the &s;ole Prevention of her Ruin was my being &s;o

my Misfortunes, and to prevent the
&s;candalous Reflection of my Death in &s;o dete&s;table

hoping that in that Time I &s;hould get into &s;ome

<P>Now being pretty well recovered of my indi&s;po|&s;ition,
by propitious Fortune, I crept into the
good Graces of Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Attorney, who em|ployed
me for a con&s;iderable Time.</P>
<P>One Day I chanced to meet <HI>John Gadbury,</HI> (my
former Landlord in <HI>Holland</HI>) who had ran away
with my Wife's Effects whom I dogged to his
Lodgings, and acquainting my Attorney for the
Commi&s;&s;ion therewith, had him &s;ecured in the
<HI>Fleet,</HI> from whence after &s;even Months Impri&s;on|ment,
he made his E&s;cape to the great detriment
of the Warden, who was obliged thereby to &s;a|tisfy
our Demands. Upon the abovementioned
Attorney's going to &s;ettle in the Country, I con|tracted
with one <HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">k,</HI> a Buckle-maker in
<HI>Water-Lane, Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> to learn the Art of carv|ing
Buckles. Our Agreement was, that I &s;hould
&s;erve him twelve Months, and for his Trouble in
in&s;tructing me in that Branch of Bu&s;ine&s;s, give
him a Promi&s;&s;ory Note for twenty five Pounds,
payable &s;ix Months after the Expiration of my
Servitude. For &s;ome time I lived very happy with
this Man, 'till by an unexpected Accident he be|came
jealous of me and his Wife; the &s;ole Rea&s;on
whereof was as follows. A Relation of Mr.

men affrighted, ran out of the Room, and he and I
&s;at down together, where I u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Arguments
to eradicate the&s;e groundle&s;s Whim&s;ies that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
his Brain; but all to no Purpo&s;e, for he remained
inflexible, and vowed Revenge on her. Wherefore
finding it in vain to reconcile the Difference, and
that I &s;hould run in danger of my Life, if I continued
any longer in his Service, I propo&s;ed a Separation,
to prevent any farther Mi&s;chief, which he readily
agreed to. Now being de&s;titute of all Bu&s;ine&s;s, I
lived on the Rever&s;ions of a Pro&s;titute of the Town,
'till growing weary of that &s;candalous Cour&s;e of Life,
I re&s;olved to go to Sea, and therefore applied to my
Friend <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">e,</HI> who was &s;o kind as to obtain for
me a Letter of Recommendation to Captain <HI>Tollard,</HI>
Commander of the <HI>Pearl</HI> Man of W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">, that was go|ing
on her Station to <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Now I might have
been happy, and recovered my lo&s;t Reputation and
Credit, had I been &s;o wi&s;e as to have gone on board
pur&s;uant to Order; but &s;o prevalent was my lewd
Habit of Life, that I could not quit the ruinous
Company of my Harlot, with whom I &s;taid in
Dalliances of lawle&s;s Love, till the Ship was
&s;ailed.</P>
<P>By this Imprudent Action I entirely di&s;obliged all
my Friends, and was therefore obliged to keep on
in the &s;ame abandoned and de&s;picable State of Life,
till one Day, as I cro&s;&s;ed <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Square,</HI> I
was arre&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> the Officer at the Suit of
<HI>K<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">k,</HI> my former Ma&s;ter. Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> know|ing
me when I was in Pro&s;perity conducted me
to his Hou&s;e, where he told me I might remain as
long as I could find Money. I was now in the utmo&s;t
De&s;pair, and had there ended my Days mi&s;erably by
<PB N="102" REF="104">
hanging my&s;elf, had not the Rope unfortunately
broke.</P>
<P>Now Mr. <HI>Dod</HI>'s wife being ill, had lodgings in
the country, and his bu&s;ine&s;s often calling him out, I
was left in the hou&s;e with only two women &s;ervants,
which made me re&s;olve to take the fir&s;t favourable op|portunity
of making my e&s;cape, neither was it long
before I effected it; for one day as <HI>Dod,</HI> and his fol|lower
were gone to <HI>Kenti&s;h Town,</HI> I &s;ent the old
woman out for a quart of gin, and ply'd her &s;o
clo&s;e with that intoxicating liquor, that &s;he &s;oon fell
fa&s;t a&s;leep. As to the young one, I elevated her &s;pi|rits
with &s;ack and walnuts, till by amorous toys,
and merry waggi&s;h tales, I prevailed on her to grant
me the favour of &s;tanding at the &s;treet door for the
benefit of the air. In the interim came by a barrow
of peaches, whereupon, come, my dear, &s;aid I, will
you eat a peach? &s;he replying, yes, &s;ir, I gave her
&s;ixpence to purcha&s;e &s;ome of them, but did not &s;tay
to partake of the remainder, for I immediately ran
down to <HI>Temple</HI>-&s;tairs, and cro&s;&s;ed the water, where
I lay perdue at the hou&s;e of one <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> an acquaint|ance
of mine, who employed me to make handles for
bru&s;hes, and afterwards recommended me to Mr.
<HI>Weed,</HI> a colourman, who had built a Shed in a
field remote from all hou&s;es, where he boiled his bul|lock's
blood, an ingredient u&s;ed among&s;t them in the
compo&s;ition of blue. This retired life, attended with
a noi&s;ome &s;tench did not long agree with me, and
therefore I re&s;olved to &s;ell my&s;elf for a four year's &s;er|vant.
Accordingly I contracted with one <HI>Burge,</HI> who
&s;ent me on board the <HI>Spani&s;h Town</HI> Factor captain
<HI>Gray,</HI> bound to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> In my pa&s;&s;age I &s;ettled the
captain's books, who &s;old me for a &s;chool-ma&s;ter
<PB N="103" REF="105">
to Colonel <HI>Sands</HI> at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> who having a Plan|tation
at <HI>Saltpan-Hill,</HI> removed me and his children
thither, for the better conveniency of their education.
Here I continued near three months, frequently di|verting
my&s;elf in the company of one <HI>Quimino,</HI> a
facetious and tru&s;ty negroe &s;lave, belonging to my
ma&s;ter, till growing weary of the mean and poor
diet I met with there I re&s;olved at all events to run
away; and accordingly about four in the morning,
I went privately to <HI>Pa&s;&s;age Fort,</HI> but had not got
into the boat that was to carry me to <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> before
I was pur&s;ued, overtaken, and conducted back. Not|with&s;tanding
this, I &s;till remained ob&s;tinate, and in&s;i&s;ted
on going to the colonel's at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which being
agreed to, I loudly exclaimed again&s;t the ill Treat|ment
I had met with, and plainly told him, that I
would &s;erve him no longer; which &s;o exa&s;perated the
colonel, that he threatened to have me whipt by his
negroes. Enraged at this menace, I &s;wore that
nothing le&s;s than his life &s;hould expatiate the gro&s;s
affront; whereupon he finding me &s;o re&s;olute, remanded
me to my former captain, with whom (he having bu|ried
one of his hands) I returned to <HI>England,</HI> and
in the <HI>Downs</HI> was pre&s;&s;ed by his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the
<HI>Portland,</HI> from whence I went to <HI>Ilvercomb, Bri|&s;tol,</HI>
and <HI>Bath,</HI> and rambled up and down the country
with my comrade, who was one of our corporals o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
board, till having expended all our ca&s;h, we made
the be&s;t of our way to <HI>London,</HI> taking the opportu|nity
of pa&s;&s;ing for &s;ea-faring men ca&s;t away in the
<HI>Lamb,</HI> captain <HI>Morgan,</HI> bound for <HI>Ireland,</HI> with
the tran&s;port &s;oldiers; by which fal&s;e pretence we
obtained great relief on the road. When we came
to <HI>London,</HI> we lodged in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, at one of tho&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="106">
mean and &s;candalous hou&s;es, that harbour &s;trangers
for two pence a night. But this life not being agree|able
to either of us, I per&s;uaded my companion to en|ter
for a &s;oldier in the foot guards, and for my part
I &s;old my&s;elf once more to go to <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> and con|tinued
on board near a week in the river; but there
finding indifferent u&s;age, and &s;earing to meet with
wor&s;e at &s;ea, I &s;tole a&s;hore in company with a weaver&punc;
who was likewi&s;e going on the &s;ame fooli&s;h errand&punc;
From thence we travelled to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where pre|tending
our&s;elves to be <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> we were r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lieved
by the Prote&s;tants of that town, and then continued
on our journey to <HI>Dover,</HI> where by good fortune we
met with captain <HI>Jennings,</HI> who gave us our pa&s;&s;age
to <HI>Calais.</HI> At my landing there, I was &s;olicited by
by &s;everal <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> officers to enli&s;t into the <HI>French</HI> &s;er|vice,
but would by no means agree to their propo&s;als.
My companion now parted from me in &s;earch of bu|&s;ine&s;s,
but I entered my&s;elf on board a &s;now, loaded
with corn, and bound for <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI> At <HI>Calais,</HI> we
&s;taid &s;even weeks, in which time the captain and
all the crew were &s;o involved in debt, that we
were obliged to put to &s;ea in the middle of the
night. When we arrived at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> the Com|mander
was turned out of his employ, and we all
paid off.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet lying there, I had &s;ome
thoughts of entering on Board thereof, but was
prevented by Me&s;&s;r. <HI>Ibraham</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Gue&s;t,</HI>
who kept a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">avern at <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Bay,</HI> who agreed
with me &s;or ten Pounds per Annuum to &s;erve them
in the Capacity of a Drawer. Here I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s
that I lived upon the be&s;t that the City af|forded
and each of my Ma&s;ters keeping a &s;epa|rate
<PB N="105" REF="107">
Lady of Plea&s;ure, I likewi&s;e grew wanton,
and maintain'd a Mi&s;s for my&s;elf; but as this
Cour&s;e of Life could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any
long Duration, my Ma&s;ter &s;oon fail'd, and I there|by
was obliged to &s;eek out for a fre&s;h Service.
Hereupon I &s;hipp'd my&s;elf with Captain <HI>Brook,</HI>
Commander of the <HI>Sarah</HI> Galley, bound to <HI>Sancta-Cruz,</HI>
in <HI>Barbary,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cadiz</HI> and
&s;o home to <HI>England</HI>; but the Captain and I not
long agreeing together, I ran away from her at
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> from thence, (after I had involved my&s;elf in
Debt) I made the be&s;t of my Way to <HI>Malaga</HI> by
by Land, all through the Province of <HI>Andaluzia.</HI>
In my Journey, I was greatly &s;urprized at the Po|verty,
and extreme Mi&s;ery of the Inhabitants,
chiefly owing to their Bigottry, they &s;carcely hav|ing
Bread to eat whil&s;t the pretended Religious are
pampered up in the mo&s;t exuberant Luxury.</P>
<P>When I arrived at <HI>Malaga,</HI> I lodged at one <HI>O'|Brian</HI>'s
almo&s;t a Month upon Credit, but finding
at la&s;t cold Reception, I re&s;olved to apply myfelf
to the Clergy, who I knew full well were the only
Per&s;ons for me to work on, and having ob&s;erved
that it was cu&s;tomary for &s;ome of them to frequent
the Sea-&s;ide daily; I &s;eated my&s;elf there on a Stone,
and in a melancholy Po&s;ture waited for their com|ing;
nor was it long before two of the Dominican
Order came, and &s;eated them&s;elves by me, asking
in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue, what Countryman I was?
I replied in <HI>Latin,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>; whereupon ac|cording
to their fooli&s;h Notion, deoming me no
Chri&s;tian, and therefore incapable of Salvation,
they out of their &s;eeming Piety, invited me to
their Convent, there to be in&s;tructed in their Faith.
<PB N="106" REF="108">
In &s;hort, I verify'd the old Proverb, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity has
no Law</HI>; for being then almo&s;t &s;tarved, I was glad
to embrace any thing that offered for my imme|diate
Relief, and pretending to be entirely igno|rant
of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Principals, I pa&s;s'd on them for
a great Proficient therein. Here I liv'd a retir'd
and indolent Life near four Months, during which
Time they often pre&s;s'd me to the Acceptance of
the Habit, which I always declin'd, as having an
Aver&s;ion to their &s;uper&s;titious Follies, though by
them artfully contrived to impo&s;e on the giddy
Vulgar. The&s;e Fathers recommended me to the
Service of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nobleman, in Quality of Page
to his Lady, with whom I liv'd eleven Months, till
being unfortunately di&s;cover'd in an Amour with
his Niece, whom I had debauched, and was forced
to &s;kreen my&s;elf from the Rage of the injured
<HI>Don,</HI> by leaping out at the Window, and making
the be&s;t of my Way to the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tay|lor
of my Acquaintance, where I lay concealed
for a con&s;iderable Time, till at length meeting
with a Sloop bound to <HI>Gibralter,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> I entered on Board thereof, our Pa&s;&s;age
was unparallell'd, and hardly credible, for we were
thirty-five Days before we got into the Bay at
<HI>Gibralter,</HI> which from <HI>Malaga,</HI> is but eighteen
Leagues di&s;tant. Wherefore thinking that &s;uch an
uncommon and unu&s;ual Di&s;appointment, portend|ed
&s;omething fatal attendant on our Sloop. I there
quitted her, and offered my&s;elf as a Soldier in the
Garri&s;on, but was rejected, by the Followers of
<HI>Mars,</HI> on Account of my Stature, whereupon
having nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, I was forc'd to per|form
the di&s;agreeable and &s;lavi&s;h Part of a Labour|er
<PB N="107" REF="109">
to the <HI>Bricklayers,</HI> which I thought was the
greate&s;t Hard&s;hip that I ever yet met with, and
therefore I re&s;olved to quit this intollerable fatiguing
Service, and &s;eek out for &s;ome other more facile.</P>
<P>Accordingly I applied my &s;elf to the <HI>Tennis-Court,</HI>
and &s;erved therein as a Waiter; but that
likewi&s;e did not an&s;wer my Expectation, for my
Mi&s;tre&s;s, on Account of the wet Sea&s;on, not hav|ing
&s;o much Company as u&s;ual, put me to fetch
Water from the Fountain, and clean the Hog&s;ties,
which &s;ervile Employs not con&s;i&s;ting with my No|tions
of Life, I quitted her Service, and com|menced
U&s;her to a School-ma&s;ter, who not living
within the Bounds of his Schola&s;tical Revenues,
was in a little Time compelled to quit the Gar|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>I now thought I had a fair Expectance of &s;uc|ceeding
him in that Occupation, but my Hopes
therein prov'd abortive, through the Malice of &s;ome
envious Per&s;ons, who repre&s;ented me to the then
Governor (General <HI>Sabine</HI>) as a Per&s;on &s;ent thither
as a Spy, though in Di&s;gui&s;e; whereupon his Ex|cellency
ordered me to be confin'd in the <HI>Moor</HI>'s
Ca&s;tle, and in a noi&s;ome and filthy Cell, where I
continued for the Space of &s;eventeen Days; at the
Expiration of which I was relea&s;ed and turned out
of the Garri&s;on. Whereupon I &s;hipp'd my&s;elf as
<HI>Cook</HI> on Board a <HI>Tartan,</HI> commanded by one <HI>An|thony
Jenkins,</HI> bound for <HI>Walidea,</HI> on the <HI>Barbary</HI>
Shore. We went out in our Balla&s;t, with four

our Ve&s;&s;el with Corn, and then return to <HI>Gibralter,</HI>

But the Ma&s;ter, either through his Ignorance, or

of three Pound of <HI>Barbary</HI> Ru&s;k per Week,
and half a Pint of Water a Day. The&s;e Hard|&s;hips,

being afraid to go into the u&s;ual Port of that Place,

re&s;olved to loo&s;e no Time in freeing my&s;elf

met with a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> mounted on a <HI>Bourico,</HI> or
Jack-A&s;s, who civilly bidding us Good-Morrow,
a&s;ked for an old Pipe, whereupon, I having the

Mayor of that Town, which we then &s;aw on the

thinking it &s;ecure to make any longer Stay here,
<PB N="110" REF="112">
lea&s;t the Captain (who without Di&s;pute would come
in Search of us) &s;hou'd on his Appearance confute
our A&s;&s;ertions, and thereby making us appear
greater Villains, than what we had repre&s;ented him,
and obtain an Order to have us bound Neck and
Heels, and carried on Board, where we could expect
no Mercy from him, or the injured <HI>Moors,</HI> we there|fore
went privately in the Night to the Place called
<HI>la Valla,</HI> the Re&s;idence of the Governor, where
&s;tood two Convents, one of <HI>Dominican,</HI> and the
other of <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Fryars, where we took Sanc|tuary,
my two Comrades in the latter, and I in the
former Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>The Priors of the re&s;pective Orders, treated us
very hand&s;omly, and promi&s;ed to &s;ecure us from
all Danger, if we kept in the Confines of their pri|viledged
Territories. We had not been long here,
before the Captain came up to the Governor's, and
upon Complaint, that he could not put to Sea
without his Hands, obtained of him an Order to
apprehend us, if found without the Limits of the
Convents, it not being in his Power to take us out
of the Pale of the Church. Hereupon the Captain
endeavoured by Flattery, to per&s;uade us to return
on Board, but all in vain, for we not only re&s;olved
to continue in our Station, but al&s;o to do him all
the Prejudice we cou'd; and therefore I drew up a
Complaint to the Governor, and prevailed on the
Prior to pre&s;ent it to his Excellency, &s;etting forth
our barbarous U&s;age; and that the &s;aid Com|mander
had <HI>Moors</HI> on Board, who under Pretence
of Traffick, came to take a View of the I&s;land,
in order to return with Force, and &s;urpri&s;e the
Inhabitants. This &s;o incen&s;ed the Governor, that
<PB N="111" REF="113">
he ordered a Company of Soldiers on Board, to
&s;earch the Ve&s;&s;el, and to oblige the Captain to
pay 334 Dollars as a Fine for not anchoring in
the open Port; and furthermore, to put to Sea
in ten Days Time. All which he unable to re&s;i&s;t
their &s;uperior Power, was obliged to comply
with.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was &s;ailed, we ranged through
the I&s;land at our Liberty, and were civilly enter|tained
by the Natives, in the be&s;t manner they
could afford. My Companions went on Board a
<HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, but I waited for the Arrival of the
Father Provincial, well knowing that if I had the
Fortune to get into his good Graces, that it would
turn con&s;iderably to my Advantage; wherefore on
his Arrival there, I play'd my Cards with &s;o
much Art and Cunning, that I &s;oon obtained the
Favour of waiting on his Per&s;on, who I mu&s;t ac|knowledge
treated me with the utmo&s;t Humanity.
With him I went to <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> another of the
<HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, where I continued in the &s;ame Po&s;t;
but altho' I never wanted for the be&s;t of Victuals,
nor Cloaths, neverthele&s;s &s;eeing no Pro&s;pect of
getting Money in his Service, (the Clergy of that
Profe&s;&s;ion being generally much addicted to the
inordinate Love thereof) I left him, and from
thence proceeded to the Port of <HI>Oratava,</HI> where
for &s;ome Time I was maintain'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Merchants; but as Courte&s;ies of that Nation are
not of any long Duration, I was &s;oon obliged to
Ship my&s;elf on Board the <HI>Charming Molly</HI> Captain
<HI>Patrick Mackhugh,</HI> bound to <HI>Genoa,</HI> where we un|loaded
onr <HI>Orchilea,</HI> (a Weed u&s;ed by the <HI>Dyers</HI>)
and after about a Month's Continuance there, we
<PB N="112" REF="114">
loaded with Bale Goods for <HI>Cadiz.</HI> And I now
waiting on the Captain, I had an Opportunity of
&s;eeing the Directions of the &s;everal Letters that he
brought for the numerous Merchants of that City,
and among&s;t them I found one directed to Me&s;&s;rs.
<HI>Ryan</HI> and <HI>Mannock</HI>; whereupon knowing Mr.
<HI>Mannock</HI> to have been my old School-fellow, and
familiar Companion when in Trade, I re&s;olv'd to
wait on him, and therefore a&s;ked the Captain Li|berty
to go a&s;hore, where I &s;ecreted my&s;elf all
Night in a <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> Hou&s;e, and the next Morning
waited on my worthy Friend, who a&s;ked me
<HI>What Service could he do me?</HI> To which generous
Offer I reply'd, <HI>Sir, plea&s;e to obtain my Di&s;charge
from the Commander.</HI> Whereupon he immediately
gave me a Note to the Captain for that Purpo&s;e;
yet he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to di&s;charge me, and the
next Day &s;ailed for St. <HI>Lucan,</HI> to load with Fruit
for <HI>London,</HI> leaving me behind. Mr. <HI>Mannock</HI> (as
my Wages were but trivial) advi&s;ed me not to trou|ble
my&s;elf about them, but ordered me to take a
Lodging, and come to Dinner with him every
Day, untill he could procure my Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
in a Gentleman-like manner; he enabled me
be&s;ides to quit my Seaman's Garb, and gave me a
genteel Suit of his own, with Shirts, Hat, Wig,
&amp;c. and 20 Pi&s;toles in my Pocket.</P>
<P>Now I began to ta&s;te the Plea&s;ures of Life once
more and buried all my former Hard&s;hips in Obli|vion;
yet &s;till I ob&s;erved a regular and &s;edate
Conduct for fear of di&s;obliging my generous Pa|tron;
till one Night in the <HI>Carnaval</HI> Time I unfor|tunately
picked up a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady, with whom I
went Home, and &s;pent the Evening in lewd Plea|&s;ures,
<PB N="113" REF="115">
&s;ures, and as I was returning Home thro' a dark
Pa&s;&s;age, my Hat and Wig were &s;natch'd from off
my Head, and at the &s;ame Time a Book that I
had borrowed of my Friend was pick'd out of my
Pocket. The Place was &s;o dark and ob&s;cure, that
I could not di&s;cover the Villain, who fled as fa&s;t
as he could, and &s;oon &s;kreen'd him&s;elf from my
fruitle&s;s Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>It is oftentimes very Dangerous for Strangers
at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and many other Places in <HI>Spain,</HI> to fre|quent
Hou&s;es kept by Courtezans, becau&s;e there
are frequently, if not always, Fellows who re&s;ort
thither and make their Prey of poor Sailors, and
others, who are &s;o unfortunate as to go thither.
They watch every Per&s;on very narrowly and are
&s;ure to make &s;omething of them; for if they
have not an Opportunity of robbing you in the
Hou&s;e, you are &s;ure to be met, and plundered
as you return home to your Quarters; and many
Times <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors have been &s;tabb'd in dark
Places in that City a cruel In&s;tance of which
happened during the Time I tarried there.</P>
<P>A young Fellow, an Iri&s;hman, Clerk to the
Captain of the <HI>Cales</HI> Factor, (for <HI>Cales</HI> is more
frequently u&s;ed by Mariners than <HI>Cadiz</HI>) being
returning from a bad Hou&s;e, where he had idly
&s;pent two Days and Nights with lewd Women,
and &s;quandered away a great deal of Ca&s;h, he was
attacked in the Dusk of the Evening by &s;ome
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, who barbarou&s;ly murdered him, after
they had taken all his Money, and even &s;tript all
the Cloaths from off his Back; and I never could
hear that the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians were ever detected, tho'
the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul and the Commander of the Ve&s;|&s;el
<PB N="114" REF="116">
to which the Youth belonged, publi&s;h'd a Re|ward
for apprehending them; and the Governor
of <HI>Cadiz</HI> did all he could to bring them to Ju&s;tice
and Puni&s;hment; but all the Searches that were
made by the Officers of the City were ineffectual,
and the Rogues were never found out, as I ever
heard of.</P>
<P>This unhappy Affair however, put mo&s;t of
the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h Seamen on their Guard, who
rather cho&s;e to tarry on board their re&s;pective
Ships, than hazard their Lives on Shore among
&s;uch abandoned Wretches as the Courtezans, and
the Villains who re&s;ort among&s;t them, who act
much in the &s;ame Manner as Bullies do to the
common Pro&s;titutes who ply in <HI>London</HI> Streets,
but with a good deal more Caution, for fear of
being clapp'd up in Pri&s;on, from which they are
&s;eldom or ever di&s;charged, without being fined,
and corporally puni&s;hed. But, to return to my
own Story.</P>
<P>Stung with Remor&s;e, not &s;o much I confe&s;s for
the Offence, as for the Lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained; I
went Home greatly perplex'd, how to prevent
this &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ter from reaching my Friend's Ear,
which full well I knew I cou'd not effect but by
procuring the Book the &s;ole Ob&s;tacle to the
Concealment of my pa&s;t Folly; but Mr. <HI>Mannock</HI>
had unfortunately heard of the Affair by the Book
being expo&s;ed to Sale; wherefore at Dinner he
a&s;ked me for the &s;ame, &s;aying, <HI>That he highly
e&s;teemed it, as being a pre&s;ent from his Brother to
him.</HI> I blu&s;h'd, and after Dinner called him a&s;ide,
freely acknowledged my Fault, and humbly begg'd
Pardon for the Offence, which he generou&s;ly for|gave;
<PB N="115" REF="117">
but cautioned me to beware of the like
Folly for the future. I now re&s;olved, (&s;ince my
Friend was acquainted with the Amour) to make
the Harlot (whom I &s;u&s;pected to be an Accom|plice
in the Robbery) to render me an ample Sa|tisfaction
for the Injury received, and therefore I
made my Complaints to the Alcade Major, or
Mayor of the Town, who order'd two Officers to
go with me to the Hou&s;e, and to demand the
Goods I had lo&s;t; and if the Pro&s;titute refu&s;ed to
deliver them, to &s;eize her Effects, and carry her to
Pri&s;on. In &s;hort the Hu&s;&s;y to prevent the im|pending
Storm returned the Things, and as an At|tonement
for her Crime, gave the Officer and me
a Dollar a-piece, and a hand&s;ome Treat.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cadiz,</HI> I had an Opportunity of keeping
Company with &s;ome Spani&s;h Sea Officers, and
other Gentlemen of Fa&s;hion, who finding me a
Man of tolerable Capacity, took &s;ome Pains to
in&s;truct me in the Spani&s;h Language. Many Au|thors
have mentioned the Multiplicity of Titles
u&s;ed by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but without having
perfect Knowledge of them, and therefore I will
here give them my Readers.</P>
<P>He is &s;tiled King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Leon,</HI> of <HI>Ara|gon,</HI>
of the two <HI>Sicilies,</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI>

and Continent of the Ocean, Arch-Duke of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI>
Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Brabant</HI> and <HI>Milan,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="118">
Earl of <HI>Flanders Tirol</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> Lord of
<HI>Bi&s;ca</HI> and <HI>Molina, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have been in the City of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> which is a
very antient one, and was built by <HI>Barea,</HI> a Car|thagenian,
200 Years before Chri&s;t, has a &s;afe
Harbour on the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> is large, well for|tify'd,
and &s;ecured by a Ca&s;tle without it, called
<HI>Mount Jovi.</HI> It was well built before the French
Siege in 1688, which ruined many &s;tately Struc|tures,
and the Inhabitants were rich. Into this
Place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> put all their Foot, under the
Command of the Prince of <HI>He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tadt.</HI> The
<HI>French</HI> opened their Trenches, and carry'd them
on with extraordinary Vigour, though much re|tarded
by bad Weather, and the continual Fire of
the Be&s;ieg'd. At the &s;ame Time the <HI>French</HI> Fleet
riding before the Harbour threw in abundance of
Bombs. The Garri&s;on made &s;everal great Sallies,
in which many Men were killed on both Sides,
but yet they were always repul&s;ed, and had not
their intended Effect. Yet the Be&s;iegers had no
great Rea&s;on to rejoice in their Succe&s;s, for being
too few to enclo&s;e the City, it was daily &s;upplied
from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army that lay hard by. <HI>Vendo&s;me</HI>
(the French General) under&s;tanding that it was
concerted to attack him by way of a general Sally,
and from both the Vice Roy's &s;mall Camps, re|&s;olved
to prevent them, and therefore leaving a
&s;ufficient Force to &s;ecure his Works, he marched
him&s;elf with one Part of his Army, &s;ending the
the Sieur <HI>d'U&s;&s;on,</HI> with the other in the Dead of the
Night, and &s;urprizing both the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Camps,
put all to the Rout, killing many, and dronwing
many more, who endeavoured to get over the Ri|ver
<PB N="117" REF="119">
<HI>Lobregat,</HI> taking all their Baggage, among
which was the Vice Roy's, in it a Box with 22000
Pi&s;toles, and 700 Hor&s;es and Mules. This Suc|ce&s;s
encouraged the Be&s;iegers, who &s;prung two
Mines under two Ba&s;tions, and lodg'd them&s;elves
on them, though with the Lo&s;s of many Men,
and having blown up other Mines, and made a
con&s;iderable Breach, at la&s;t the Garri&s;on capitu|lated
to march out the 15th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in an ho|nourable
Manner, and be conducted to Tarragona.
It was reported that this City co&s;t the French
12000 Men, which indeed &s;eems incredible, but
very many died of Sickne&s;s. The Bombs thrown
in by the Fleet had de&s;troy'd above half the Town,
but when I was there, it appeared like a flouri&s;h|ing
City.</P>
<P>The trade at <HI>Cadiz</HI> is far more exten&s;ive than
that of any other port belonging to the Spani&s;h mo|narch
either in Europe, or el&s;ewhere; the galleons
and flotilla load and unload here, when go to, or re|turn
from the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, from whatever I have
heard or read of it, is beyond Di&s;pute the longe&s;t
in Extent; and, if we con&s;ider the infinite and
great Wealth of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> perhaps the very
riche&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>The Emperor of China, generally e&s;teemed the
greate&s;t Monarch for compa&s;s of Dominions, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
not above as much Land as all <HI>Europe</HI> to|gether
makes; but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has more
than that in <HI>America</HI> alone, be&s;ides all his great
Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;ome, though not very
large, in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> yet they are &s;uch as are
of a con&s;iderable Value.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
It is well known that this Monarch has Lands
in all the four Parts of the World, and therefore
the Spaniards &s;ay the Sun never Sets upon his
Dominions. They are too large to be de&s;crib'd by
me who here only give the Reader a view of them
in the Names of the &s;everal Countries with the
Arch-bi&s;hopricks, Bi&s;hopricks, and Univer&s;ities,
in them together with the Number of Towns as
near as Authors have been able to compute, and
&s;ome Hints of Revenues which are as follows.</P>
<P>In Spain twelve Kingdoms, or large Provinces,
which are Ca&s;tile, Leon, Aragon, Navarre, Ca+talonia,
Galicia, Valencia, Murcia, Bi&s;cay, Gra|nada,
Andaluzia, and E&s;tremadura, wherein there
are &s;ixteen Thou&s;and &s;even Hundred Towns, ele|ven
Arch-bi&s;hopricks, and forty-&s;even Bi&s;hopricks,
and fourteen Univer&s;ities, the Revenues of the
Crown out of only the&s;e Provinces here mentioned,
amount to above thirty-&s;ix Millions of Ducats
yearly. The Income of the abovemention'd Arch|bi&s;hopricks
is near nineteen Million of ducats.</P>
<P>The prebendaries, pari&s;hes, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical
benifices, are worth as much more.</P>
<P>There are nine thou&s;and mona&s;teries, and in them
near eighty thou&s;and religious per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates of the dukes that are grandees of <HI>Spain</HI>
are worth near two millions of ducats per annnm, and
&s;ome &s;ay a good deal more.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Marqui&s;&s;es that are grandees, about
one million and a half of ducats.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Earls grandees, upwards of four
hundred thou&s;and ducats.</P>
<P>All the&s;e revenues are within the kingdom, without
including the va&s;t income hoth King and Nobles yearly
<PB N="119" REF="121">
have from the We&s;t Indies, and other parts of the
world.</P>
<P>I have heard the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> clergy declare, that their
mo&s;t catholick, and augu&s;t monarch is the riche&s;t
and mo&s;t powerful prince in the univer&s;e; but we all
know this is fal&s;e; however, it was not my bu&s;ine&s;s
to contradict the prie&s;ts, for I always concurr'd with
what they &s;aid, becau&s;e I was greatly carre&s;s'd, and
led a lazy life, and lived very well among&s;t them dur|ing
my &s;tay.</P>
<P>In Africa, on the Coa&s;t of Mazelquivir, the
King of Spain has Oran, Penon, Melillae and
Ceuta. The Canary I&s;lands being &s;even in Num|ber,
called Lancarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Ca|naria,
Tenrife, Gomera, Falma, and Hierro.</P>
<P>In A&s;ia he has the Philipine I&s;lands, which with
others between them and New Spain, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the Spaniards are above two Hundred, but the
chiefe&s;t of them all is Lucon, which though not
broad is above two Hundred Leagues in length,
on it is built a good City called Manila, upon a
noble River, at the Mouth of which is a &s;trong
Fortre&s;s, and on the other Side the River an indif|ferent
Town. All the&s;e I&s;lands produce Gold,
Cinnamon and other rich Commodities.</P>
<P>In America, he is Ma&s;ter of &s;o many I&s;lands on
the North Sea, that the Number was never yet
known. Tho&s;e call'd Kecayes, are many and large,
tho&s;e of St. John de Puerto Rico, about eighty
Leagues in Length, and twenty in Breadth, Cuba
three Hundred Leagues in Length, and twenty
in Breadth, Hi&s;paniola above five Hundred
Leagues in Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Continent of America, is divided into two
<PB N="120" REF="122">
Penin&s;ulas, link'd together by a &s;mall Neck of
Land, but eighteen Leagues over.</P>
<P>The Northern Penin&s;ula is called New Spain,
and the Southern Peru.</P>
<P>The Southern Penin&s;ula, which is all encom|pa&s;&s;ed
with the Sea, except where the I&s;thmus joins
it it to the Continent, and here are many very rich
Provinces.</P>
<P>In the&s;e We&s;tern Countries there are &s;ix Arch|bi&s;hopricks
and thirty-one Bi&s;hopricks; but as I
intend to have done with this Subject, I &s;hall pro|ceed
to my own Hi&s;tory, until I land my&s;elf once
more in my native Country.</P>
<P>My good Friend, Mr. Mannock, having &s;ent
for me, told me, he had agreed for my Pa&s;&s;age
Home, and that I mu&s;t go on board in the Even|ing,
for the Ship would &s;ail the next Morning for
England: Whereupon I humbly thank'd him for
all Favours, and took my la&s;t Farewell of him,
highly overjoy'd at the Thoughts of my returning
one more to my native Country. But as I pa&s;&s;ed
through the City Gates with a full Intent to go on
Board, I unhappily met a Courtezan, a quandom
Acquaintace, with whom I &s;tay'd all Night, but the
next Morning when I came down to the Mould, I
found to my equal Sorrow and Surprize, the Ship
was &s;ail'd; whereupon I was &s;o enrag'd at this fatal
Di&s;appointment occa&s;ioned entirely by my own
Folly, that I almo&s;t re&s;olved to put a Period to
my wretched Life, and now being no longer able
to &s;tay at Cadiz, for fear of being &s;een by my in|jured
Friend, I took Boat and went over to Fort
St. Mary, and from thence to St. Lucar, where I
had heard, that one Mr. Brown, a wealty Merchant
<PB N="121" REF="123">
re&s;ided who&s;e Si&s;ter had been married to my Un|cle
Sir <HI>Roger Langley.</HI> Here I had the Honour
to dine with this Gentleman, who made me a
a Pre&s;ent of two Doubloons, and advi&s;ed me to
return Home. Whereupon, lodging at the Hou&s;e
of one Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who kept an Ordinary for the
Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els, I fortunately became ac|quainted
with Captain <HI>Whitaker,</HI> bound for <HI>Cowes</HI>
and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> with this Gentleman I came Home,
landed at <HI>Limington,</HI> and from thence made the
be&s;t of my Way to <HI>London,</HI> where finding that
my Creditors had received 10 s. in the Pound in
my long Ab&s;ence, I was in Hopes of receiving
the &s;um &s;tipulated by Parliament for Bankrupts,
and thereby rein&s;tating my&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ettled Bu|&s;ine&s;s
with my Wife. Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> her Father being
dead in my Ab&s;ence, and all the Differences now
now &s;eemingly thereby to be appea&s;ed, whereupon
I waited on my Mother-in-law, and to her made
Propo&s;als of &s;ending for my Wife to Town, which
&s;he agreed to, but through her avaritious Temper,
refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with Money to enable me to
advance my&s;elf once more in Trade, and recover my
Right from the Statute, and to obtain my Certifi|cate
from the Creditors. Whereupon finding my
good De&s;igns rend'red impracticable, I gave a
Loo&s;e to fal&s;e Plea&s;ure, leading a loo&s;e and extra|vagant
Li&s;e, until I had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted all my
&s;lender Gains, as likewi&s;e a &s;mall Legacy that was
le&s;t me by my Cou&s;in <HI>Brent.</HI> Wherefore I now
re&s;olv'd once more to range abroad in Search of
new Adventures, and accidentally coming ac|quainted
with one Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> a young Spark of as
de&s;perate a Fortune as my own, with him I pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="124">
to make a Tour to <HI>Paris</HI>; in order where|unto
we travelled by Land to <HI>Dover,</HI> but on our
Arrival there, we were unhappily di&s;appointed in
our intended Progre&s;s, by an Embargo laid on the
Shipping in that Port.</P>
<P>Where on our Return Home, Money being
low, we &s;topp'd <HI>John Springate</HI> of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI>
within Sight of the Turnpike at <HI>Harble Down,</HI> but
upon rifling his Pockets, and finding no more
than three Farthings therein, not thinking &s;o

we return'd him the &s;ame, and civilly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
him.</P>

<P><PB N="123" REF="125">
As to my Part, I did not care what became
of me, for my Life had already been mi&s;erable
enough; but my unfortunate <HI>Fellowman,</HI> (which
is generally u&s;ed by tho&s;e who engage in bad
Cour&s;es) or I may &s;ay, more properly, <HI>Brother
Thief</HI>) knew not the Con&s;equence of this Affair,
nor did he &s;eem more affected than a poor Country
Fellow that had robb'd a Hen-Roo&s;t: I bid him be
quiet and ea&s;y, and keep up his Countenance, for
I was con&s;cious we had committed the Robbery,
and, if the Man &s;wore to our Per&s;ons, we mu&s;t
&s;tand committed to the County Gaol.</P>
<P>After we had tarried near an Hour in the Apart|ment
where the Ju&s;tice hears Affairs of this kind,
in came his wor&s;hip with his bouncing Belly, at|tended
by the Con&s;table, Headborough, and Ty|thingmen,
who all of them &s;eem'd to be plea&s;ed
with the Reward of 80 <HI>l.</HI> that they &s;hould have
for hanging us, and quarrelled in the Hall, even
before the Magi&s;trate was &s;eated, who was entitled
to the greate&s;t Share.</P>
<P>After Silence was demanded in the Hall, <HI>Alli|bone</HI>
the Con&s;table, who had Charge of us, was
commanded to bring us forward to the Place of
Audience. Both of us had our Hands tied behind
us, at that Time; but his Wor&s;hip was &s;o humane
as to order us to be untied, which was done in an
In&s;tant.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we tarried for a Hearing, the Ju&s;tice had
Notice brought him by a Livery Servant, that Sir
<HI>Thomas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">s,</HI> had called to pay him a Vi&s;it, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="124" REF="126">
to take a Dinner with him.&mdash;His Wor&s;hip de|parted,
but returned again pre&s;ently, on purpo&s;e
to di&s;patch us one way or other.&mdash;I had forgot to
mention, that poor <HI>Hill,</HI> whil&s;t we were together
in the Hall, whi&s;per'd me, and &s;aid, <HI>why</HI> Gill,
<HI>this is only a Bridewell Job,</HI> tell me?&mdash;I &s;hook my
Head, and told him, I was afraid it was much
wor&s;e;&mdash;at which he appear'd to be quite di&s;pirit|ed,
and very &s;orrowful.</P>
<P>Our Examination before the Ju&s;tice was but
very &s;hort; <HI>Springate</HI> was called, and a&s;k'd if he
knew either of us, and was cautioned to be po&s;i|tive
to what he &s;wore.</P>
<P>He told the Ju&s;tice that we had robb'd him, but
he believed it was only <HI>in Fun,</HI> (that it is in a
merry Way) for that he had got his Three Far|things
returned him again.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome of the Country Fellows per|&s;uaded
him to &s;wear that he was put in &s;ear of his
Life; and told him, that if he did not, we &s;hould
ruin him for ever;&mdash;&s;o the poor Fellow very
ju&s;tly &s;wore it; we did order him to deliver; and
&s;wore we wou'd either have his Money or his Life.
From my Heart, I don't believe the Man would
have troubled him&s;elf about us, had he not been
&s;pirited on by his clowni&s;h Acquaintance, (I mean
our Pur&s;uers and Apprehenders) who wanted us
hanged for the &s;ake of the Reward, which was
&s;orry Pounds &s;or each of us.</P>
<P>On the Man's po&s;itive affidavit, the Ju&s;tice &s;oon
<PB N="125" REF="127">
ordered his Footman to write our <HI>Mittimus</HI> to the
County Goal, where we were convey'd by a &s;trong Po&s;&s;ee,
being mounted on Hor&s;eback, with our Legs chained
under the Hor&s;e's Belly, and guarded by thirty Coun|try
Loobies, the Con&s;table who had the Commitment,
riding fir&s;t with his long Staff, pitched on his Boot,
exactly repre&s;enting an Officer guarding a poer Cri|minal
to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P>At this Time the Country being pe&s;tered with Smug|glers,
and as we pa&s;&s;ed on to <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> every Body
imagined we were &s;ome of that Gang that were re|ported
to be taken in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> which caus'd Numbers
of People, both on Hor&s;eback and on Foot to follow
us into <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> Town. I never in my Life &s;uf|fered
&s;o great a Puni&s;hment as the Fatigue of this
Journey from the Ju&s;tice's to Pri&s;on; it being ex|ce&s;&s;ive
hot Weather, and in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI>
I could not per&s;uade my Guard to &s;top for a little
Refre&s;hment, the Con&s;table pretending he apprehended a
Re&s;cue was intended by the Smugglers.</P>
<P>When we approached near the Entrance of <HI>Maid|&s;tone</HI>
Town, there appeared to me to be as many Peo|ple
as were generally at <HI>Newgate</HI> to &s;ee the poor Cri|minals
go forth to Execution.</P>
<P>As I went into the Goal I thought to my&s;elf, <HI>Poor</HI>
Gill, <HI>here you have ca&s;t you la&s;t Stone</HI>! My Friend
<HI>Hill, napp'd his Bibb</HI> (a cant Term for Weeping)
and &s;aid he was ruin'd. I told him, <HI>I hop'd not,</HI>
<HI>but I was afraid we were undone (Body and Breeches)
'till next Month</HI>; meaning the time we were to be
try'd.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
No &s;ooner were we un-hors'd, but the <HI>cunning</HI>
Con&s;table deliver'd his Commitment o the Turnkey,
who was a <HI>funny Dog</HI>; and on looking at it, re|turn'd
it to the Con&s;table, telling him he had no Bu|&s;ine&s;s
with <HI>Three Farthing Chaps,</HI> and that he mu&s;t
take us to the Place from whence we came. The &s;illy
Con&s;table &s;tar'd; and the Turnkey &s;natching the
Commitment from him again, ordered us (Pri&s;oners)
both to walk forward into the Lodge, which
we, with &s;orrowful Hearts, were oblig'd to comply
with.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I was under the&s;e unhappy Cir|cum&s;tances,
nothing diverted more than the Pa&s;time
between the Con&s;table, his Attendants and the Turn|key,
who told him, <HI>As we were the fir&s;t two Pri|&s;oners

again.</HI> The <HI>Silly Oaf</HI> laugh'd, and ordered the
Wine immediately, which was not deliver'd before
be tipp'd 'em the Ready-Pull-Out; and what was
very merry, it went round &s;o fa&s;t, that before it came
to the Con&s;table's Turn, he ne'er ta&s;ted one Drop; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oon after more was called for, that the Con&s;table drank
&s;o freely that he was <HI>Top-Heavy (meaning he had it
in his Nob)</HI> and dropp'd the Receipt which the Turn|key
had given him as a Di&s;charge for his Delivering
us to the Keeper of the County Goal of <HI>Kent</HI>; for
the Return of which he paid another Bottle; and,
after drinking a Gla&s;s or two, went away, but &s;oon
return'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd demanded the Hor&s;e Locks that <HI>Hill</HI>

have them if he did not go out of Town before; but
if he did, he &s;hould receive them by a Penny Po&s;t
Letter. The Silly Cull went off full of <HI>Booze,</HI> and
I remained there full of <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the con&s;table and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants de|parted
but my poor c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nfederate <HI>Hill</HI> and I were called
before the head turnkey; when we appeared, he, <HI>Cer|berus</HI>
like, ordered us <HI>to come to Book.</HI> I put on a
very dejected and &s;orrowful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">untenance, and told
him neither I nor my companion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;ow&s;e to &s;ave
us from perdition. He then ordered us to &s;it down
at a table, where he, like <HI>Radamanthus</HI> the Judge
of Hell, &s;at to determine complaints among&s;t the pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>We had not been long &s;eated before he call'd out to
a fellow who wos one of the jiggers, or under&s;trappers
belonging to the goal, and the fellow immediately ap|pearing
before him, made a low bow, and de&s;ired to
know his plea&s;ure. Here, <HI>Bob,</HI> &s;aid the turnkey,
(pointing to me) that gentleman has a good upper|&s;hell,
and de&s;ires to borrow a trifle on it.</P>
<P>At this expre&s;&s;ion I &s;tared like a conjurer, well
knowing that my <HI>Upper-Shell,</HI> was my great coat;
but, however, I had no remedy but patience, being
obliged to comply with this villainous demand; and &s;o
I was immediately obliged to &s;trip, not &s;o much ro|garding
the lo&s;s of my coat, as the tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion
of the&s;e &s;ort of fellows, who always make
the be&s;t market they can of the unfortunate per&s;ons
that are committed to their care.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
Finding my&s;elf &s;tript, I look'd on poor <HI>Hill</HI>

mi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">n in the <HI>Stripping Lay,</HI> they play'd off a
new Game with my Friend, as will appear in the
Sequel.</P>
<P>But, to return to my Story: In about half an
Hour returns the Fellow, &s;eemingly very joyous,
running to me in a great Hurry, and putting three
Shillings into my Hand, told me that was all he
could borrow on my Coat; and, D<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">mn me (&s;aid

&s;haking me by the Fi&s;t, &s;aid he, Friend, I believe
your'e a <HI>Cock.</HI> I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of pocketing
the In&s;olence of this Ra&s;cal, and was glad to get
rid of his Impertinence and Stupidity, con&s;idering
&s;uch Fellows as he were the only Per&s;ons that
could relieve me under my pre&s;ent unhappy Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Hill</HI> (who now look'd as cunning as a dead
Pig) ask'd me what I intended to do with the Mo|ney?
I an&s;wer'd him, You'll &s;oon &s;ee an end of it:
&mdash;And ju&s;t as I was &s;peaking, up &s;tept the Turn|key,
who had then ju&s;t left Company, and acco&s;ted
me in this Manner:&mdash;'Well, Friend, I &s;uppo&s;e

Cu&s;tomer to the Hou&s;e; and he often <HI>gigs</HI> it
with the old Dutche&s;s.'&mdash;On this the Turnkey
was called out to take Charge of another Pri&s;oner,
and I was glad he was gone, fearing he wanted my
little Cole, having only that to &s;upport me.</P>
<P>Newgate now came fre&s;h into my Memory, but
recommend me to that Pri&s;on (terrible as the Name
is) for Humanity; for being a Pri&s;oner there for
Debt a con&s;iderable Time, I could perceive how
the Felons were u&s;ed by the under Keepers, and
even the Ma&s;ter of the Gaol him&s;elf, who at that
Time was Rowland Ingram, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who would
come into the Common Felons Ward, and hear
Complaints again&s;t the Jiggers or Runners, if
they had beat or injured any one.</P>
<P>Our Turnkey of <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> was a civil Fellow
enough, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who had the Ca&s;h, and
of the three Shillings I had, he was &s;o civil as to
accept only of half a Crown; and when he got
near my <HI>All,</HI> he de&s;ired one of the Followers to
put on our Darbies.&mdash;This Scene, which I never
had yet been accu&s;tom'd to, gave me the greate&s;t
Unea&s;ine&s;s; but to do Ju&s;tice to my worthy Friend,

<P>In the Morning at the Time of unlocking our

a little Sub&s;i&s;tance. He told me I was welcome,
provided I was furni&s;h'd with Pen, Ink, and Pa|per;

not, no An&s;wer being ever returned, which was

the week after the Mother of a Fellow Pri&s;oner,

formerly kept Company with near St. Martin's in

<P>This Letter was received, but not by the Party
it was directed to, &s;he having been married &s;ome
Time before; but her Si&s;ter, lodging in the &s;ame

opening it, read the Contents, which &s;he gene|rou&s;ly

<P>The a&s;&s;izes for the Home Circuit being appoint|ed
