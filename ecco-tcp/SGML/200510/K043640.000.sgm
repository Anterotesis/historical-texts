<HEAD TYPE="sub">Query I.</HEAD>
<P N="1">WHETHER there ever was, is,
or will be an indu&s;trious Nation
poor, or an idle, rich?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a People can be called
poor, where the common Sort are well fed,
cloathed, and lodged?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Drift and Aim of
every wi&s;e State &s;hould not be, to encourage
Indu&s;try in its Members? and whether tho&s;e,
who employ neither Heads nor Hands for
the common Benefit, de&s;erve not to be expel|led
like Drones out of a well governed State?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the four Elements, and
Man's Labour therein, be not the true Source
of Wealth?</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="4" REF="3">
5. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Money be not only &s;o
far u&s;eful, as it &s;tirreth up Indu&s;try, enabling
Men mutually to participate the Fruits of
each others Labour?</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether any other Means, equal|ly
conducing to excite and circulate the In|du&s;try
of Mankind, may not be as u&s;eful as
Money?</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the real End and Aim of
Men be not Power? And whether he who
could have every Thing el&s;e at his Wi&s;h or
Will, would value Money?</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the public Aim in every
well govern'd State be not, that each Member,
according to his ju&s;t Preten&s;ions and Indu&s;try,
&s;hould have Power?</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Power be not referred to
Action; and whether Action doth not follow
Appetite or Will?</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Fa&s;hion doth not create
Appetites, and whether the prevailing Will of
a Nation is not the Fa&s;hion?</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Current of Indu&s;try
and Commerce be not determin'd by this pre|vailing
Will?</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="5" REF="4">
12. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not owing to Cu|&s;tom
that mo&s;t Fa&s;hions are agreeable?</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it may not concern the
Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature to interpo&s;e in the
making of Fa&s;hions; and not leave an Affair
of &s;o great influence, to the management of
Women and Fops and Taylors and Vintners?</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether rea&s;onable Fa&s;hions are
a greater re&s;traint on Freedom than tho&s;e which
are unrea&s;onable?</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a general good Ta&s;te in
a People would not greatly conduce to their
thriving? And whether an uneducated Gen|try
be not the greate&s;t of national Evils?</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Cu&s;toms and Fa&s;hions
do not &s;upply the Place of Rea&s;on, in the
Vulgar of all Ranks? Whether, therefore,
it doth not very much import that they &s;hould
be wi&s;ely framed?</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the imitating tho&s;e
Neighbours in our Fa&s;hions, to whom we
bear no likene&s;s in our Circum&s;tances, be
not one cau&s;e of Di&s;tre&s;s to this Nation?</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether frugal Fa&s;hions in the
upper Rank, and comfortable living in the
<PB N="6" REF="5">
lower, be not the Means to multiply Inha|bitants?</P>
<P N="19">19. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the bulk of our Iri&s;h
Natives are not kept from thriving, by that
cynical Content in Dirt and Beggary, which
they po&s;&s;e&s;s to a Degree beyond any other
People in Chri&s;tendom?</P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the creating of Wants
be not the likelie&s;t way to produce Indu&s;try
in a People? And whether if our Pea&s;ants were
accu&s;tomed to eat Beef and wear Shoes they
would not be more Indu&s;trious?</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether other Things being giv|en,
as Climate, Soil, &amp;c. the Wealth be
not proportioned to the Indu&s;try, and this to
the Circulation of Credit, be the Credit cir|culated
or transferred by what Marks or To|kens
&s;o ever?</P>
<P N="22">22. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether therefore le&s;s Money
&s;wiftly circulating be not, in effect, equivalent
to more Money &s;lowly circulating? Or whe|ther
if the Circulation be reciprocally as the
Quantity of Coin, the Nation can be a Lo&s;er?</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Money is to be con&s;ider|ed
as having an intrin&s;ic Value, or as being a
Commodity, a Standard, a Mea&s;ure, or a
Pledge, as is variou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted by Writers?
<PB N="7" REF="6">
And whether the true Idea of Money, as
&s;uch, be not altogether that of a Ticket or
Counter?</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Value or Price of
Things, be not a compounded Proportion, di|rectly
as the Demand, and reciprocally as the
Plenty?</P>
<P N="25">25. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Terms <HI>Crown, Li|vre,</HI>
<HI>Pound Sterling,</HI> &amp;c. are not to be con|&s;idered
as Exponents or Denominations of
&s;uch Proportion? and whether Gold, Silver,
and Paper, are not Tickets or Counters for
Reckoning, Recording, and Transferring
thereof?</P>
<P N="26">26. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Denominations be|ing
retained, although the Bullion were gone,
Things might not neverthele&s;s be rated, bought
and &s;old, Indu&s;try promoted, and a Circula|tion
of Commerce maintained?</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether an equal rai&s;ing of all
Sorts of Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin can
have any effect in bringing Money into the
Kingdom? And whether altering the Propor|tions
between the &s;everal Sorts can have any
other effect, but multiplying one Kind and
le&s;&s;ening another, without any increa&s;e of the
Sum total?</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="8" REF="7">
28. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether arbitrary changing the
Denomination of Coin, be not a public
Cheat?</P>
<P N="29">29. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether neverthele&s;s the Damage
would be very con&s;iderable, if by Degrees our
Money were brought back to the Engli&s;h Va|lue,
there to re&s;t for ever?</P>
<P N="30">30. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Engli&s;h Crown did
not formerly pa&s;s with us for &s;ix Shillings?
And what Inconvenience en&s;ued to the Public,
upon its Reduction to the pre&s;ent Value, and
whether what hath been may not be?</P>
<P N="31">31. <HI>Qu.</HI> What makes a wealthy People?
And whether Mines of Gold and Silver are
capable of doing this? Whether Negroes
amid&s;t the Gold Sands of Afric are not poor
and de&s;titute?</P>
<P N="32">32. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any Vertue in
Gold or Silver, other than as they &s;et People
at Work, or create Indu&s;try?</P>
<P N="33">33. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not the Opinion
or Will of the People, exciting them to In|du&s;try,
that truly enricheth a Nation? And
whether this doth not principally depend on
the Means for counting, transferring and pre|&s;erving
Power, that is, property of all Kinds?</P>
<P N="34"><PB N="9" REF="8">
34. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if there was no Silver
in the Kingdom, our Trade might not never|thele&s;s
&s;upply Bills of Exchange, &s;ufficient to
an&s;wer the Demands of Ab&s;entees in England
or el&s;ewhere?</P>
<P N="35">35. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether current Bank Notes may
not be deemed Money? And whether they
are not actually the greater part of the Money
of this Kingdom?</P>
<P N="36">36. <HI>Qu.</HI> Provided the Wheels move, whe|ther
it is not the &s;ame Thing, as to the effect
of the Machine, be this done by the Force of
Wind or Water or Animals?</P>
<P N="37">37. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Power to command the
Indu&s;try of others be not real Wealth? And
whether Money be not in Truth, Tickets or
Tokens for conveying and recording &s;uch
Power, and whether it be of great Con&s;equence
what Materials the Tickets are made of?</P>
<P N="38">38. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Trade, either foreign
or dome&s;tick, be in Truth any more than this
Commerce of Indu&s;try?</P>
<P N="39">39. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether to promote, transfer,
and &s;ecure this Commerce, and this Property
in human Labour, or, in other Words, this
Power, be not the &s;ole Means of enriching a
<PB N="10" REF="9">
People, and how far this may be done inde|pendently
of Gold and Silver?</P>
<P N="40">40. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it were not wrong to
&s;uppo&s;e Land it &s;elf to be Wealth? And whe|ther
the Indu&s;try of the People is not fir&s;t to
be con&s;ider'd, as that which con&s;titutes Wealth,
which makes even Land and Silver to be
Wealth, neither of which would have any
Value, but as Means and Motives to Indu|&s;try?</P>
<P N="41">41. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in the Wa&s;tes of Ame|rica
a Man might not po&s;&s;e&s;s twenty Miles
&s;quare of Land, and yet want his Dinner or
a Coat to his Back?</P>
<P N="42">42. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a fertile Land, and the
Indu&s;try of its Inhabitants, would not prove
inexhau&s;table Funds of real Wealth, be the
Counters for conveying and recording thereof
what you will, Paper, Gold, or Silver?</P>
<P N="43">43. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a &s;ingle Hint be &s;uffi|cient
to overcome a Prejudice? And whether
even obvious Truths will not &s;ometimes bear
repeating?</P>
<P N="44">44. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if human Labour be the
true &s;ource of Wealth, it doth not follow that
Idlene&s;s &s;hould of all things be di&s;courag'd in
a wi&s;e State?</P>
<P N="45"><PB N="11" REF="10">
45. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether even Gold or Silver, if
they &s;hould le&s;&s;en the Indu&s;try of its Inhabi|tants,
would not be ruinous to a Country?
And whether Spain be not an In&s;tance of
this?</P>
<P N="46">46. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether the Opinion of Men,
and their Indu&s;try con&s;equent thereupon, be
not the true Wealth of Holland, and not the
Silver &s;uppo&s;ed to be depo&s;ited in the Bank at
Am&s;terdam?</P>
<P N="47">47. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there is in Truth any
&s;uch Trea&s;ure lying dead? And whether it be
of great con&s;equence to the Public, that it
&s;hould be real rather than notional?</P>
<P N="48">48. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether in order to under&s;tand
the true Nature of Wealth and Commerce,
it would not be right to con&s;ider a Ship's
Crew ca&s;t upon a de&s;ert I&s;land, and by De|grees
forming them&s;elves to Bu&s;ine&s;s and ci|vil
Life; while Indu&s;try begot Credit, and
Credit moved to Indu&s;try?</P>
<P N="49">49. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether &s;uch Men would not
all &s;et them&s;elves to Work? Whether they
would not &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the mutual Participation
of each others Indu&s;try? Whether when one
Man had in his Way procured more than
he could con&s;ume, he would not exchange
his Superfluities to &s;upply his Wants? Whe|ther
this mu&s;t not produce Credit? Whether
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to facilitate the&s;e Conveyances, to record and
circulate this Credit, they would not &s;oon
agree on certain Tallies, Tokens, Tickets or
Counters?</P>
<P N="50">50. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Reflection in the better
Sort might not &s;oon remedy our Evils? And
whether our real Defect be not a wrong Way
of Thinking?</P>
<P N="51">51. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it would not be an un|happy
Turn in our Gentlemen, if they &s;hould
take more Thought to create an Intere&s;t to
them&s;elves in this or that County or Borough,
than to promote the real Intere&s;t of their
Country?</P>
<P N="52">52. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be not a Bull to call
that making an Intere&s;t, whereby a Man
&s;pendeth much and gaineth nothing?</P>
<P N="53">53. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether if a Man builds a Hou&s;e
he doth not in the fir&s;t Place provide a Plan
which governs his Work? and &s;hall the Pub|lic
act without an End, a View, a Plan?</P>
<P N="54">54. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether by how much the le&s;s
particular Folk think for them&s;elves, the
Public be not &s;o much the more obliged to
think for them?</P>
<P N="55">55. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Cunning be not one
thing and good Sen&s;e another? And whether
<PB N="13" REF="12">
a cunning Trade&s;man doth not &s;tand in his
own Light?</P>
<P N="56">56. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether &s;mall Gains be not the
way to great Profit? And if our Trade&s;men
are Beggars, whether they may not thank
them&s;elves for it?</P>
<P N="57">57. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether &s;ome way might not be
found for making Criminals u&s;eful in Public
Works, in&s;tead of &s;ending them either to
America, or to the other World?</P>
<P N="58">58. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether we may not, as well as
other Nations, contrive Employment for
them? And whether Servitude, Chains and
hard Labour, for a term of Years, would not
be a more di&s;couraging, as well as a more
adequate Puni&s;hment for Felons, than even
Death it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="59">59. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there are not &s;uch Things
in Holland as bettering Hou&s;es for bringing
young Gentlemen to Order? And whether
&s;uch an In&s;titution might be u&s;ele&s;s among
us?</P>
<P N="60">60. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether it be true, that the Poor
in Holland have no Re&s;ource but their own
Labour, and yet there are no Beggars in their
Streets?</P>
<P N="61"><PB N="14" REF="13">

foreign Products, and who&s;e Indu&s;try
produceth nothing dome&s;tic to Exchange for
them, is not &s;o far forth injurious to his Coun|try?</P>
<P N="62">62. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether, con&s;equently, the fine
Gentlemen, who&s;e Employment is only to
dre&s;s, drink, and play, be not a public Nui|&s;ance?</P>
<P N="63">63. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether Nece&s;&s;ity is not to be
hearkened to before Convenience, and Conve|nience
before Luxury?</P>
<P N="64">64. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether to provide plentifully
for the Poor, be not feeding the Root, the
Sub&s;tance whereof will &s;hoot upwards into
the Branches, and cau&s;e the Top to flouri&s;h?</P>
<P N="65">65. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether there be any In&s;tance of
a State wherein the People, living neatly and

Ambition, making Men li&s;tle&s;s, helple&s;s,
and &s;lothful?</P>
<P N="67">67. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a Country inhabited by
People well fed, cloathed, and lodged, would
not become every Day more populous? And
<PB N="15" REF="14">
whether a numerous Stock of People in &s;uch
Circum&s;tances would not con&s;titute a flouri&s;h|ing
Nation; and how far the Product of our

of this End?</P>
<P N="68">68. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether a People, who had pro|vided
them&s;elves with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life
in good Plenty, would not &s;oon extend their
Indu&s;try to new Arts and new Branches of
Commerce?</P>
<P N="69">69. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether tho&s;e &s;ame Manufactures
which England imports from other Countries
may not be admitted from Ireland? And if

<P N="70">70. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether France and Flanders

us fall &s;hort of the Dutch, in Dama&s;ks, Dia|pers,
and printed Linen but our Ignorance in
De&s;ign?</P>
<P N="73">73. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether tho&s;e Specimens of our

Ignorance? And whether for the Honour of
the Nation they ought not to be removed?</P>
<P N="74">74. <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether tho&s;e, who may &s;light
this Affair as notional, have &s;ufficiently con&s;i|dered
the exten&s;ive u&s;e of the Art of De&s;ign,
