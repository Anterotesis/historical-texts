<P>AMONG the great Numbers, who
drink Tar Water in <HI>Dublin,</HI> your
Letter informs me, there are &s;everal, that
make or u&s;e it in an undue Manner. To ob|viate
tho&s;e Inconveniences, and render this
Water as generally u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible, you
de&s;ire I would draw up &s;ome Rules and Re|marks
in a &s;mall Compa&s;s, which according|ly
I here &s;end you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>Put a Gallon of cold Water to a Quart
of Tar, &s;tir and work them &s;trongly toge|ther
for about four Minutes; let the Ve&s;&s;el
&s;tand clo&s;e covered for eight and forty Hours,
that the Tar may &s;ub&s;ide; then pour off the
clear Water, and keep it in Bottles, well
corked, for U&s;e: This is a good general Rule,
but as Stomachs and Con&s;titutions are &s;o va|rious,
it may admit of &s;ome Latitude, the le&s;s
Water or more &s;tirring makes it &s;tronger, as
more Water or le&s;s &s;tirring makes it weaker.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ame Tar will not do &s;o well a &s;econd
Time, but may &s;erve for common U&s;es: The
putting off Tar that hath been u&s;ed, for fre&s;h
Tar, would be a bad Fraud. To prevent which
it is to be noted, that Tar already u&s;ed is of a
lighter brown than other Tar. The only Tar
that I have u&s;ed is that from our Northern
Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and that from <HI>Norway,</HI>
the latter being thinner, mixeth ea&s;ier with
Water, and &s;eems to have more Spirit. If the
former be made u&s;e of (as I have &s;ometimes
known it with good Succe&s;s) the Tar Water
will require longer &s;tirring to make it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>Tar Water, when right, is, not paler than
<HI>French</HI> nor deeper coloured than <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> White
Wine, and full as clear; if there be not a Spi|rit
very &s;en&s;ibly perceived in drinking, you
may conclude the Tar Water is not good; if
you would have it good, you mu&s;t &s;ee it made
your&s;elf. Tho&s;e who begin with it, little and
weak, may by Habit come to drink more
and &s;tronger, according to the Sea&s;on, or the Hu|mour
of the Patient. It may be drank either
cold or warm; it lays under no Re&s;traint as to
Air, Exerci&s;e, Cloaths, or Diet, and may be
taken at all times in the Year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>As to the Quantity in common chronical
Indi&s;po&s;itions, one Pint of Tar Water a Day
may &s;uffice, taken on an empty Stomach, at
two or four Times, to wit, Night and Morn|ing,
and about two Hours after Dinner and
Breakfa&s;t; more may be taken by &s;trong Sto|machs.
Alteratives in general, taken in &s;mall
Do&s;es, and often, mix be&s;t with the Blood;
how oft or how &s;trong each &s;tomach can bear,
Experience will &s;hew. But tho&s;e who labour
under great and inveterate Maladies, mu&s;t drink
a greater Quantity, at lea&s;t one Quart <HI>per</HI><PB N="4" REF="6">
<HI>Diem,</HI> taken at four, &s;ix, or eight Gla&s;&s;es, as
be&s;t &s;uits the Circum&s;tances and Ca&s;e of the
Drinker. All of this Cla&s;s mu&s;t have much
Patience and Per&s;everance in the U&s;e of this, as
well as of all other Medicines, which, if &s;ure
and &s;afe, mu&s;t yet, from the Nature of Things,
be &s;low in the Cute of inveterate Chronical
Di&s;orders. In acute Ca&s;es, Fevers of all Kinds,
it mu&s;t be drank in Bed warm, and in great
Quantity, the Fever &s;till enabling the Patient
to drink, perhaps a Pint every Hour, which I
have known to work &s;urpri&s;ing Cures.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>As the Morning's Draught is mo&s;t difficult
to nice Stomachs, &s;uch may le&s;&s;en, or even
omit it, at the Beginning, or rather po&s;tpone
it till after Breakfa&s;t, and take a larger Do&s;e at
Night; the Di&s;tance from Meal-time need not
be more than one Hour, when the Stomach is
&s;trong, or the Gla&s;&s;es &s;mall: the Oil that &s;wims
on the Top, may either be drank with the
re&s;t of the Liquor, or &s;kimmed off and kept
for outward Sores. Whether there be any
Difference between old Tar or new Tar, or
which of all the various Tars, produced from
different Trees, or in different Parts of the
World, is mo&s;t medicinal, future Trials mu&s;t
determine&mdash;I have made a &s;econd Sort of
Tar Water, to be u&s;ed externally, as a Wa&s;h
for the Itch, Scabs, Ulcers, Lepro&s;y, and all
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;uch foul Ca&s;es, which I have tried with Suc|cess,
and recommend it to the Trial of others.
For inveterate Ca&s;es of that Kind, Tar Water
&s;hould be drank, a Quart every Day, at fix or
eight Gla&s;&s;es; and at the &s;ame time the Wa&s;h
applied Outwardly, and warm, by bathing,
fomenting, and &s;teeping, to heal and dry up
the Sores, and this &s;everal Times in the twen|ty-four
Hours. This Water, for external U&s;e,
mu&s;t be made in the following manner: Pour
two Quarts of hot boiling Water on a Quart of
Tar, &s;tir and work it &s;trongly with a flat Stick
or Ladle, for a full quarter of an Hour; let it
&s;tand eight Hours, then pour it off, and keep
it clo&s;e covered for U&s;e. It may be made
weaker or &s;tronger as there is Occa&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>My Experiments have been made in va|rious
Ca&s;es, and on many Per&s;ons; and I make
no doubt its Virtues will &s;oon be more fully
di&s;covered, as Tar-water is now growing into
general U&s;e, tho' not without that Oppo&s;ition
which u&s;ually attends upon Novelty. The
great Objection I find made to this Medicine is,
that it promi&s;es too much. What, &s;ay the
Objectors, do you pretend to a Panacea, a thing
&s;trange, chimerical, and contrary to the Opi|nion
and Experience of all Mankind. Now to
&s;peak out, and, give this Objection or Que&s;tion
a direct An&s;wer, I freely own that I &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Tar-water is a Panacea. I may be mi&s;taken,
but it is worth trial; for the Chance of &s;o great
and general a Benefit, I am willing to &s;tand
the Ridicule of propo&s;ing it. And as the old
Philo&s;opher cried aloud, from the Hou&s;e-top,
to his Fellow Citizens, <HI>educate your Children</HI>;
&s;o, I confe&s;s, if I had a Situation high enough,
and a Voice loud enough, I would cry out, to
all the Valetudinarians upon Earth, <HI>drink Tar
Water.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus frankly owned the Charge,
I mu&s;t explain to you, that by a Panacea is
not meant a Medicine which cures all In|dividuals,
(this con&s;i&s;ts not with Mortality)
but a Medicine that cures or relieves all the
different Species of Di&s;tempers. And if God
hath given us &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, and made a
Medicine &s;o cheap and plentiful as Tar, to
be withal &s;o univer&s;al in its Effects, to ea&s;e
the Mi&s;eries of human Life, &s;hall Men be
ridiculed or bantered out of its U&s;e, e&s;pe|cially
when they run no Ri&s;que in the
Trial?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned I have not had Op|portunities
of trying it my&s;elf in all Ca&s;es,
neither will I undertake to demon&s;trate <HI>a</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9"><HI>priori,</HI> that Tar Water is a Panacea. But
yet, methinks, I am not quitede&s;titute of pro|bable
Rea&s;ons, which, joined to what Facts
I have ob&s;erved, induced me to entertain
&s;uch a Su&s;picion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<P>I know Tar was u&s;ed to pre&s;erve Cattle
from Contagion; and this may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to have given Ri&s;e to that Practice of drin|king
Tar Water for a Pre&s;ervative again&s;t
the Small-Pox. But as the Tar Water u&s;ed
for that Purpo&s;e was made by mixing equal
Quantities of Tar and Water, it proved a
mo&s;t offen&s;ive Portion; be&s;ides, as a fre&s;h
Gla&s;s of Water was put in for each Gla&s;s
that; was taken our, and this for many Days
on the &s;ame Tar, it followed that the Wa|ter
was not equally impregnated with the fine
volatile Spirit, though all alike &s;trongly &s;aturated
with gro&s;s Particles.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<P>Having found this nau&s;eous Draught very
u&s;eful again&s;t the Small Pox, to as many
as could be prevailed on to take it; I be|gan
to con&s;ider the Nature of Tar. I re|flected
that Tar is a Bal&s;am flowing from
the Trunks of aged Ever-geens; that it re|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="8" REF="10">
Putrefaction; that it hath the Virtues
of Turpentine, which in Medicine are known
to be very great and manifold; but I ob|&s;erved
withal, that Turpentines or Bal&s;ams
are very offen&s;ive in the taking: I therefore
con&s;idered di&s;tinctly the &s;everal con&s;tituent
Parts of Bal&s;ams; which were tho&s;e, where|in
the medicinal Virtues re&s;ided and which
were to be regarded, rather as a Vi&s;cous
Matrix to receive, arre&s;t, and retain the
more volatile and active Particles. And if
the&s;e la&s;t could be &s;o &s;eparated and di&s;engaged
from the gro&s;&s;er Parts, as to impreg|nate
a clear and potable Liquor, I concluded
that &s;uch Liquor mu&s;t prove a Medicine of
great Force, and general U&s;e. I con&s;idered,
that Nature was the be&s;t Chemi&s;t and Pre|parer
of Medicines, and that the Fragrance
and Flavour of Tar argued very active Qua|lities
and Virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<P>I had, of a long Time, entertained an
Opinion agreeable to the Sentiments of many
antient Philo&s;ophers, <HI>That Fire may be re|garded
as the Animal Spirit of this vi&s;ible
World.</HI> And it &s;eemed to me that the at|tracting
and &s;ecreting of this Fire in the va|rious
Pores, Tubes, and Ducts of Vetegables,
did impart their &s;pecifick Virtues to each
Kind; that this &s;ame Light, or Fire, was the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
immediate in&s;trumental or phy&s;ical Cau&s;e
of Sen&s;e and Motion, and con&s;equently of Life
and Health to Animals; that on Account of
this Solar Light or Fire, <HI>Phoebus</HI> was in the
ancient Mythology reputed the God of Medi|cine
Which Light as it is lei&s;urely intro|duced,
and fixed in the vi&s;eid Juice of old
Firs and Pines, &s;o the &s;etting it free in Part,
that is, the changing its vi&s;cid for a volatile
Vehicle, which may mix with Water, and
convey it throughout the Habit copiou&s;ly and
inoffen&s;ively, would be of infinite U&s;e in
Phy&s;ic, extending to all Ca&s;es what&s;oever,
ina&s;much as all Di&s;tempers are in Effect a
Struggle, between the <HI>Vis Vitae</HI> and the peculiar
Mia&s;ma or Fomes Morbi; and nothing
&s;trengthens Nature, or lends &s;uch Aid and
Vigour to Life, as a Cordial which doth not
heat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Solar Light in great Quantity during
the Space of many &s;uoce&s;&s;ive Years, being at|tracted
and detained in the Juice of ancient.
Ever-greens, doth form and lodge it&s;elf in an,
Oil &s;o fine and volatile, as &s;hall mix well
with Water, and lightly pa&s;s the <HI>Primae Viae.</HI>
and penetrate every Part and Capillary of the
original Sy&s;tem, when once exempt and freed
from the gro&s;&s;er nau&s;eous Refin. It will not,
therefore, &s;eem unrea&s;onable to whoever is
<PB N="10" REF="12">
acquainted with the medicinal Virtues of
Turpentine in &s;o many different Di&s;tempers,
for which it hath been celebrated both by
ancient and modern Phy&s;icians, and withal
reflects on the Nau&s;ea or Clog that prevents
their full Operation and Effect on the human
Body, it will not, I &s;ay, &s;eem unrea&s;onable to
&s;uch a one to &s;uppo&s;e, that if this &s;ame Clog
were removed, numberle&s;s Cures might be
wrought in great Variety of Ca&s;es.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>De&s;ideratum</HI> was, how to &s;eparate the
active Particles from the heavy vi&s;cid Sub&s;tance
wich &s;erved to attract and retain
them, and &s;o to order Matters, that the
Vehicle of the Spirit &s;hould not on the
one hand be volatile enough to e&s;cape, nor
on the other, gro&s;s enough to offend. For
the performing of this, I have found a mo&s;t
ea&s;y, &s;imple, and effectual Method, which
furni&s;heth a potable inoffen&s;ive Liquor, clear
and fine as the be&s;t White Wine, Cordial
and Stomachic, to be kept bottled, as being
endued with a very &s;en&s;ible Spirit, though,
not fermented.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<P>I tried many Experiements as to the Quan|tity
of Water, and the Time of &s;tirring and
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;tanding, in order to impregnate and clarify
it, and, after all, fixed on the forementioned
Receipt, as the mo&s;t generally u&s;eful for
making this &s;alutiferous Liquor well impreg|nated,
and not offen&s;ive to common Stomachs,
and even drank with Plea&s;ure by many: In
which the mo&s;t medicinal and active Particles,
that is to &s;ay, the native Salts, Spirit, and
volatile Oil, being di&s;entangled from the gro&s;s
Oil and vi&s;cous Re&s;in, can freely pa&s;s the
<HI>Primae Viae,</HI> in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the
&s;malle&s;t Ducts, and pervade the whole animal
Machine, and that, in &s;uch full Proportion
and Mea&s;ure, as &s;uiteth every Ca&s;e and Con|&s;titution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The foregoing general Con&s;iderations put
me upon making Experiments in many va|rious
and unlike Ca&s;es, which otherwi&s;e I
&s;hould never have thought of doing, and
the Succe&s;s an&s;wered my Hopes. Philo&s;ophical
Principles led me to make &s;afe. Trials,
and on tho&s;e Trials is founded my Opinion
of the &s;alutary Virtues of Tar Water; which
Virtues are recommended from, and depend
on, Experiments and Matters of Fact, and
neither &s;tand nor fall with any Theories or
&s;peculative Principles whatever. Howbeit,
tho&s;e Theories, as I &s;aid, enlarged my Views
of this Medicine, led me to a greater Variety
<PB N="12" REF="14">
of Trials, and thereby engendered and nou|ri&s;hed
my Su&s;picion, that it is a Panacea. I
have been the more prolix in the&s;e Parti|culars,
hoping that, to as many as &s;hall can|didly
weigh and con&s;ider them, the high
Opinion I conceive of this Medicine will not
&s;eem altogether an Effect of vain Prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
or blind empiric Ra&s;hne&s;s, but rather
the Re&s;ult of free Thought and Inquiry, and
grounded on my be&s;t Rea&s;on, Judgment,
and Experience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e who have only the Good of Man|kind
at Heart, will give this Medicine fair
play; if there be any who act from other
Motives, the Public will look &s;harp and be|ware.
To do Ju&s;tice to Tar Water, as well as
to tho&s;e who drink it, Regard mu&s;t be had
to the particular Strength and Ca&s;e of the
Patients. Grievous or inveterate Maladies
mu&s;t not be treated as common Ca&s;es. I
cured a horrible Ca&s;e, a Gangrene in the
Blood, which had broke out in &s;everal Sores,
and threatened &s;peedy Death, by obliging the
Per&s;on to drink nothing but this Liquor for
&s;everal Weeks, as much and as often as his
Stomach would bear. Common Sen&s;e will
direct a proportionable Conduct in other
Ca&s;es. But this mu&s;t be left to the Con|&s;cience
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and Di&s;ceretion of the Givers and Takers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>After all that can be &s;aid, it is mo&s;t certain,
that a Panacea &s;ounds odd, and conveys &s;ome|what
&s;hocking to the Ear and Sen&s;e of mo&s;t
Men, who are wont to rank the univer&s;al Me|dicine
with the Philo&s;ophers Stone, and the
Squaring of the Circle; whereof this chief, if
not &s;ole Rea&s;on, I take to be, that it is thought
incredible, the &s;ame Thing &s;hould produce
contrary Effects, as it mu&s;t do, if it cures op|po&s;ite
Di&s;tempers. And yet this is no more
than every Day's Experience verifies. Milk,
for in&s;tance, makes &s;ome co&s;tive, and others
laxative: This regards the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Pa|nacea
in general; as for Tar Water in parti|cular,
I do not &s;ay it is a Panacea, I only &s;u&s;|pect
it to be &s;o.&mdash;Time and Trial will
&s;hew.</P>

<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<P>But I am mo&s;t &s;incerely per&s;uaded from

induced by the Nature and Analogy of Things,
and its wonderful Succe&s;s in Fevers of all

to be called forth from his pre&s;ent Ob&s;curity
into Practice, when he has rai&s;ed a Character
by demoli&s;hing a Writer of Eminence.</P>
<P>But <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> as he &s;uppo&s;es the World will
take him to be, I much doubt whether it may
mot give to the Bi&s;hop, even in <HI>that Re&s;pect,</HI>
the Preference. To make a Science a <HI>No&s;trum,</HI>
is as <HI>quacki&s;h</HI> as to make a Medicine one.
Knowledge is open to every Man of Sen&s;e and
Application; and has the Bi&s;hop &s;hewn his
Want of either in his Study of Phy&s;ic, tho' it
is not more immediately his Profe&s;&s;ion? How
frequently have Phy&s;icians turn'd Divines?
where is the Ab&s;urdity for a Divine to become
a Phy&s;ician? Is the Pale of Phy&s;ic only &s;o nar|row
that it admits of no Interlopers? What
then does this <HI>Gentleman</HI> mean, when he tells
us<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE>, <HI>the principal Points of Knowledge nece&s;|&s;ary
to a Phy&s;ician, are</HI> NATURALLY <HI>wanting</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="20"><HI>in a Divine</HI>? Alas! it is not the Degree, or
the Robe, the tye Wig, or the Gold-headed
Cane, that makes the Phy&s;ician, anymore than.
Prunella the Par&s;on. But the Knowledge of
either may be concealed under every Habit,
and the &s;even Sciences contained without a
College Title.</P>
<P>Need I produce Authority or Example for
this? the two great Names of <HI>Bacon</HI> and <HI>Boyle</HI>
will be la&s;ting Monuments, that the Know|ledge
of Phy&s;ic is not confined to tho&s;e of the
Profe&s;&s;ion only.</P>
<P>But the Letter-Writer &s;ays<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE>, He cannot
<HI>gue&s;s,</HI> from any Part of the Bi&s;hop's Treati&s;e,
<HI>that he ever made Phy&s;ic his Study.</HI> Many
others &s;ay, he talks as rationally of it as tho&s;e
that have. This Author him&s;elf ob&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ves<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Page 37.</NOTE>,
That he has <HI>&s;earched the Books of Phy&s;icians
for Hi&s;tories of Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and to find out <HI>the
peculiar</HI> Properties <HI>of Medicines</HI>; no &s;mall Part
of a Phy&s;ician's Learning, as much, I believe,
as many an one &s;ets up on. But becau&s;e the
Bi&s;hop has applied it to the magnifying his fa|vourite
Medicine, this Author will not allow
him to have made any Improvement from his
Re&s;earches.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, that Phy&s;ic has eluded his
Labours, becau&s;e the Theory of it is more
<PB N="20" REF="21">
exten&s;ive than any other? The World has ge|nerally
judged very differently. And, if we
con&s;ider how &s;acredly the Avenues to this Sci|ence
are guarded, by my&s;teriou&s;ly pre&s;cribbing
Things unknown in an unknown Tongue, how
it is conver&s;ant with Mankind in its weake&s;t
State, when the Mind is drooping, and catches
at any Thing that promi&s;es Relief, the whole
Faculty ought with <HI>Humility and Thankful|ne&s;s</HI>
to acknowledge the Reputation the World
has given them. Nay, I would appeal to this
very Writer, whether he is not per&s;uaded, that e|ven
a regular Phy&s;ician's Practice does not depend
more on his Addre&s;s to the Whims and Foi|bles
of his Patients, than his real Skill in his
profe&s;&s;ion. I ask this, when he has compar'd
his own Merit with his Practice. I know his
<HI>natural</HI> Pride will extort from him what his
<HI>artificial</HI> Pride would tempt him to conceal.</P>
<P>To <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Study</HI> has not the Bi&s;hop
join'd <HI>Experience</HI>? Experience founded on
his own unbounded Genero&s;ity to the Poor,
itself an Ho&s;pital without adventitious Sub|&s;criptions.
And is he not to be believ'd, when
he tells us, without Fee or Reward, he has
known, frequently known, after repeated Tri|als,
upon various Con&s;titutions, his Medicine
prove &s;ucce&s;sful? The Letter-Writer &s;ays the
Facts were all<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Page 36.</NOTE> <HI>mi&s;under&s;tood,</HI> and endea|vours
to prove from Theory, that<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Page 18.</NOTE> <HI>Tar</HI>

<HI>worth the Name of one, and that it can care
no one Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> Nay, to make &s;ure Work, and
to be as far in one Extreme as the Bi&s;hop in
the, other, That it can do no Good<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Page 20.</NOTE>, but
may do Harm. He a&s;&s;ures us <HI>Cold Water
oured on Tar can take none, not the lea&s;t of
its Medicinal Virtues</HI>: That, <HI>if we ask the
Chemi&s;t, he will tell us,</HI> "Oil cannot be mix'd with, or drawn forth by Cold Water." Now
in Obedience to this Gentleman I have <HI>ask'd</HI>
the Chemi&s;t, and he tells me, that &s;ome of
<HI>the Virtues of the Oil of Tar may be drawn
forth by Cold Water.</HI> And I have actually
ta&s;ted Water, wherein the Oil of Tar was
wa&s;hed (two Ounces to a Pint) &s;trongly im|bued
with its Virtues, and which had much
the &s;ame Ta&s;te with Water wherein the Oil
of <HI>Benzoin</HI> was wa&s;hed. In Analyzing Tar
there are found to come over &s;ome fine Flow|ers,
&s;o quick with the Oil that they cannot be
&s;eparated, which may be communicated to
Water. And it is well known, all Acids will
imbibe &s;ome Part of the Flowers, or fine&s;t
Part of the Oil of all Re&s;inous Sub&s;tances.
As it may afford &s;ome Satisfaction to the Let|ter-Writer,
and enable others to determine
more particularly the Virtues of Tar, I &s;hall
&s;et down the Product of 22 Pound of the be&s;t

&s;hall only ob&s;erve almo&s;t as odd an one in this

of great Effects<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Page 28.</NOTE> produced by a trifling Altera|tion
in the Pointing. "In&s;tead of <HI>Cain</HI>'s &s;aying,
<HI>I have killed a Man</HI> with a Colon at the

only write it thus, <HI>I have killed a Man.</HI>"
Where is the Difference? This Story, it
&s;eems made him <HI>wonder,</HI> when he heard it,
and it makes the Reader <HI>&s;tare,</HI> when he reads it.
It &s;hould be, I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>Have I killed a Man.</HI>
But when he tells us how the fame Blun|der
came to &s;tand in his &s;econd Edition, as well
as in his fir&s;t, we may find out perhaps how
<HI>Tar and Honey</HI> came to be in the <HI>Index</HI> only.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop having illu&s;trated how Acid
are &s;heathed by Alkalies from a Simile of Spi|gots
and Faucets, this Author's Mode&s;ty I
much offended at it. Hail! <HI>Woodward</HI> lives
I cannot but admire, &s;aies he, <HI>the perfect
Decency of your Lord&s;hip's Manner, your ex|cellent
Cleane&s;s as well as Delicacy in</HI> Sm|lles.
Which reminds me of the Lady that
could not bear a Chapter of hard Names
for Fear there &s;hould be &s;ome what immode&s;
in them.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that he cut down the
Bi&s;hop in Phy&s;ic, unle&s;s he makes Repri&s;als
<PB N="27" REF="28">
upon him in Divinity. He charges him
with making the Scriptures &s;erve the Turn
of his Philo&s;ophy <HI>by new Tran&s;laitions, and
even where there was no need of it.</HI> This, I
&s;uppo&s;e, alludes to &sect;. 179. where the Bi&s;hop
ob&s;erves that the Pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, <HI>who
maketh his Mini&s;ters a flaming Fire,</HI> might as
well be rendered, and more agreeably to the
Context, <HI>who maketh flaming Fire his Mini|&s;ters.</HI>
If it is more agreeable to the Context,
why will this Author &s;ay, <HI>There was no need
of the Alteration</HI>? And, as to the Charge of
Novelty, there is &s;carce a Commentator but
gives the Pa&s;&s;age the &s;ame Con&s;truction, tho'
they have nothing to do with the Bi&s;hiop's
Hypothe&s;is. Without a Pomp of Quotations,
I recommend only to this Author's Polite
Ta&s;te, <HI>Buchanan's</HI> Ver&s;ion; or, if that is more

<Q>Apparent accinctae <HI>AURAE FLAMMAEQUE</HI>
mini&s;trae.</Q>
<P>In the &s;ame Place he &s;aies, <HI>I &s;hall only
commemorate to your Lord&s;hip's Honour as a
Bi&s;hop, that you can &s;often Athei&s;m into Mi&s;|con&s;truction.</HI>
Ay, and this very Lord&s;hip he
<HI>honours and re&s;pects,</HI> As A Bishop, <HI>whom as a
Physician he de&s;pi&s;es.</HI> It is plain, his <HI>per&s;onal
Charity</HI> is as great as his <HI>publick Zeal,</HI> which
could prompt him to con&s;ute an Author, half
dead as he was with the Fatigues of Practice
which that very Author had helped him to.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
But how has his Lord&s;hip been guilty of
le&s;&s;ening Athei&s;m? Why he has vindicated,
it &s;eems, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and &s;ome other Philo&s;ophers
from that Imputation, by &s;hewing how their

of whom, I am per&s;uaded, cure more than
