<HEAD>TO Mrs. <HI>ARABELLA FERMOR.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT will be in vain to deny that I have some Value for this Piece, since I Dedicate it to You. Yet You may bear me Witness, it was intended only to divert a few young
<PB REF="4">
Ladies, who have good Sense and good Humour enough, to laugh not only at their Sex's little unguarded Follies, but at their own. But as it was communicated with the Air of a Secret, it soon found its Way into the World. An imperfect Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller, You had the Good-Nature for my Sake to consent to the Publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to be|fore I had executed half my Design, for the <HI>Machinery</HI> was entirely wanting to compleat it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Machinery,</HI> Madam, is a Term invented by the Criticks, to signify that Part which the Deities, Angels, or Dae|mons, are made to act in a Poem: For the ancient Poets are in one respect like
<PB REF="5">
many modern Ladies; Let an Action be never so trivial in it self, they always make it appear of the utmost Impor|tance. These Machines I determin'd to raise on a very new and odd Foundation, the <HI>Rosicrucian</HI> Doctrine of Spirits.</P>
<P>I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard Words before a Lady; but 'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to have his Works understood, and particu|larly by your Sex, that You must give me leave to explain two or three difficult Terms.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rosicrucians</HI> are a People I must bring You acquainted with. The best Account I know of them is in a French Book call'd <HI>Le Comte de Gabalis,</HI> which
<PB REF="6">
both in its Title and Size is so like a <HI>Novel,</HI> that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by Mistake. According to these Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call <HI>Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,</HI> and <HI>Salamanders.</HI> The <HI>Gnomes,</HI> or Daemons of Earth, de|light in Mischief; but the <HI>Sylphs,</HI> whose Habitation is Air, are the best-condition'd Creatures imaginable. For they say, any Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Fa|miliarities with these gentle Spirits, upon a Condition very easie to all true <HI>Adepts,</HI> an inviolate Preservation of Chastity.</P>
<P>As to the following Canto's, all the Passages of them are as Fabulous, as the Vision at the Beginning, or the Transfor|mation at the End; (except the Loss of
<PB REF="7">
your Hair, which I always name with Re|verence.) The Human Persons are as Ficti|tious as the Airy ones; and the Character of <HI>Belinda,</HI> as it is now manag'd, resem|bles You in nothing but in Beauty.</P>
<P>If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in Your Person, or in Your Mind, yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the World half so Uncensured as You have done. But let its Fortune be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given me this Occasion of assuring You that I am, with the truest Esteem,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>

<L>Thrice the wrought Slipper knock'd against the Ground,</L>
<L>And striking Watches the tenth Hour resound.</L>
<L><HI>Belinda</HI> still her downy Pillow prest,</L>
<L>Her Guardian <HI>Sylph</HI> prolong'd the balmy Rest.</L>
<L>'Twas he had summon'd to her silent Bed</L>
<L>The Morning Dream that hover'd o'er her Head.</L>
<L>A Youth more glitt'ring than a <HI>Birth-night Beau,</HI></L>

<L>Fairest of Mortals, thou distinguish'd Care</L>
<L>Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!</L>
<L>If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant Thought,</L>
<L>Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught,</L>
<L>Of airy Elves by Moonlight Shadows seen,</L>
<L>The silver Token, and the circled Green,</L>
<L>Or Virgins visited by Angel-Pow'rs,</L>
<L>With Golden Crowns and Wreaths of heav'nly Flow'rs,</L>
<L>Hear and believe! thy own Importance know,</L>
<L>Nor bound thy narrow Views to Things below.</L>
<L>Some secret Truths from Learned Pride conceal'd,</L>
<L>To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:</L>
<L>What tho' no Credit doubting Wits may give?</L>
<L>The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.</L>
<L>Know then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,</L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="12">These, tho' unseen, are ever on the Wing,</L>

<L>As now your own, our Beings were of old,</L>
<L>And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous Mold;</L>
<L>Thence, by a soft Transition, we repair</L>

<L>That all her Vanities at once are dead:</L>
<L>Succeeding Vanities she still regards,</L>
<L>And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the Cards.</L>
<L>Her Joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,</L>
<L>And Love of <HI>Ombre,</HI> after Death survive.</L>
<L>For when the Fair in all their Pride expire,</L>
<L>To their first Elements the Souls retire:</L>
<L>The Sprights of fiery Termagants in Flame</L>
<L>Mount up, and take a <HI>Salamander</HI>'s Name.</L>
<L>Soft yielding Minds to Water glide away,</L>
<L>And sip with <HI>Nymphs,</HI> their Elemental Tea.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13">The graver Prude sinks downward to a <HI>Gnome,</HI></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know farther yet; Whoever fair and chaste</L>

<L>For Spirits, freed from mortal Laws, with ease</L>
<L>Assume what Sexes and what Shapes they please.</L>
<L>What guards the Purity of melting Maids,</L>
<L>In Courtly Balls, and Midnight Masquerades,</L>
<L>Safe from the treach'rous Friend, and daring Spark,</L>
<L>The Glance by Day, the Whisper in the Dark;</L>
<L>When kind Occasion prompts their warm Desires,</L>
<L>When Musick softens, and when Dancing fires?</L>

<L>Tho' <HI>Honour</HI> is the Word with Men below.</L>

<L>Instruct the Eyes of young <HI>Coquettes</HI> to roll,</L>

<L>And little Hearts to flutter at a <HI>Beau.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>Oft when the World imagine Women stray,</L>
<L>The <HI>Sylphs</HI> thro' mystick Mazes guide their Way,</L>

<L>What tender Maid but must a Victim fall</L>
<L>To one Man's Treat, but for another's Ball?</L>

<L><PB N="7" REF="15">With varying Vanities, from ev'ry Part,</L>

<L>This erring Mortals Levity may call,</L>

<L>I saw, alas! some dread Event impend,</L>
<L>E're to the Main this Morning's Sun descend.</L>
<L>But Heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:</L>

<L>Beware of all, but most beware of Man!</L>

<L>SHE said: the pitying Audience melt in Tears,</L>

<L>In vain <HI>Thalestris</HI> with Reproach assails,</L>

<L>Not half so fixt the <HI>Trojan</HI> cou'd remain,</L>
