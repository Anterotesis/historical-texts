<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a long Complaint of the Vertuous
and Refined World, that Poe&s;ie who&s;e Original
is Divine, &s;hould be en&s;lav'd to Vice and Profane|ne&s;s;
that an Art in&s;pired from Heaven &s;hould have
&s;o far lo&s;t the Memory of its Birth-place, as to be in|gaged
in the Intere&s;ts of Hell: and bring all her re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s
Forces of Metaphor, Wit, Rhyme and Num|ber,
and range them under the Banner of the Great
Malicious Spirit to a&s;&s;ault the Honour of God and
the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>The Elde&s;t Song which Hi&s;tory has brought down
to our Ears was a noble Act of Wor&s;hip paid to the
God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> <Q>When his <HI>Right hand became glo|rious
in Power, when thy Right hand, O Lord,
da&s;hed in pieces the Enemy; the Chariots of Pharaoh
and his Ho&s;t were ca&s;t into the Red-Sea; Thou did&s;t
blow with thy Wind, the Deep covered them, and
they &s;ank as Lead in the mighty Waters,</HI> Exod. 15.</Q>
This Art was maintain'd Sacred thro' the following
Ages of the Church, and imploy'd by Kings and Pro|phets,
by <HI>David, Solomon,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> in breathing
the Life of Angels into the Hearts of Men, and rear|ing
their Minds Heavenward in warm and tuneful
Devotion.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
In the Younger Days of Heatheni&s;m the Mu&s;es
were devoted to the &s;ame Service: The Language in
which Old <HI>He&s;iod</HI> addre&s;&s;es them is this.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="2 lines">,</L></Q><Q>In Engli&s;h.
<LG>
<L>Pierian Mu&s;es, fam'd for Heavenly Lays,</L>
<L>De&s;cend, and &s;ing the God your Fathers Prai&s;e.</L>
</LG></Q>And the pur&s;ues the Subject in ten Pious Lines, which
I could not forbear to Tran&s;cribe if the A&s;pect and
Sound of &s;o much <HI>Greek</HI> were not terrifying to a nice
Reader.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of the later Poets of the <HI>Pagan</HI> World
have more deba&s;ed this Divine Gift, and many of
the Writers of fir&s;t Rank in this our Age of Na|tional
Chri&s;tians have to their Eternal Shame &s;urpa&s;|&s;ed
the vile&s;t of the Gentiles. They have Expos'd
Religion to Drollery, and dre&s;t her up in the mo&s;t
Ridiculous Habit, for the Scorn of the ruder Herd
of Mankind. They have painted the Vices like &s;o
many Godde&s;&s;es, added the Charms of Wit to Debau|chery,
and heightned the Temptation where Nature
needs the &s;tronge&s;t Re&s;traints. With Sweetne&s;s of
Sound and Delicacy of Expre&s;&s;ion they have given a
Reli&s;h to Bla&s;phemies of the har&s;he&s;t kind, and when
they rant at their Maker in Sonorous Numbers they
fancy them&s;elves to have acted the Hero well.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
Thus almo&s;t in vain have the Throne and the Pul|pit
cried, <HI>Reformation,</HI> while the Stage and Licen|tious
Poems have waged open War with the Pious
De&s;ign of Church and State. The Pre&s;s has &s;pread
the Poy&s;on far, and &s;catter'd wide the Mortal Infecti|on;
Unthinking Youth have been allured to Sin be|yond
the Vicious Propen&s;ities of Nature, plung'd
early into Di&s;ea&s;es and Death, and &s;unk down to
Damnation in Multitudes. How will the&s;e Allies of
the Nether World, the Lewd and Profane Ver&s;ifiers
&s;tand agha&s;t before the Great Judge, when the Blood
of many Souls whom they never &s;aw &s;hall be laid to
the Charge of their Writings, and be dreadfully re|quir'd
at their Hands. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
has &s;et this Awful Scene before them in ju&s;t and fla|ming
Colours; and if the Application were not too
rude and uncivil, that noble Stanza of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;|common</HI>
on <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 148. might be addre&s;s'd to them,
<Q><L>Ye Dragons, who&s;e Contagious Breath</L>
<L>Peoples the dark Retreats of Death,</L>
<L>Change your dire Hi&s;&s;ings into Heav'nly Songs,</L>
<L>And prai&s;e your Maker with your Forked Tongues.</L></Q></P>
<P>But ala&s;s! there is a deep Silence among the&s;e
Men of all Divine Subjects, unle&s;s in Banter; The
Wonders of Creating Power, the My&s;teries of Re|deeming
Love, and the mighty Works of Renewing
Grace are neglected by tho&s;e, whom Heaven has in|dued
with a Gift proper to adorn and cultivate 'em:
An Art who&s;e &s;weet In&s;inuations might have almo&s;t
<PB REF="5">
convey'd Piety into re&s;i&s;ting Nature, and melted
Souls of Iron to the Love of Virtue.</P>
<P>Will the Writers of this Age cite the <HI>French</HI> Critic
on their &s;ide, and &s;ay,
<Q><L>De la Foy d'un Chr&eacute;tien les My&s;teres terribles</L>
<L>D'Ornemens egayez ne &s;ont point &s;u&s;ceptibles:</L></Q>
That the My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity are not capable of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Ornaments: The <HI>Davideis</HI> and the two <HI>Arthurs</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> broke down this Ob&s;tacle, and experimentally
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">futed the vain pretence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Chri&s;tian My&s;teries have no need of
the&s;e Tin&s;el Trappings; the Glories of our Religion
in a plain Narration and a &s;imple Dre&s;s have &s;ome|thing
brighter and bolder in them, &s;omething more
&s;urprizing and Divine, than all the Adventures of
Gods and Heroes, all the dazling Images of fal&s;e lu|&s;tre
that compo&s;e and garni&s;h a Heathen Poem; here
the Subjects them&s;elves would give wonderful Aids
to the Mu&s;e; and the Heavenly Theme would &s;o
relieve a dull Hour and a langui&s;hing Genius, that
when the Mu&s;e nods, the Sen&s;e would burn and
&s;parkle upon the Reader, and keep him feelingly
awake.</P>
<P>With how much le&s;s toil and expence might a
<HI>Dryden,</HI> an <HI>Otway,</HI> a <HI>Congreve,</HI> or a <HI>Dennis</HI> furni&s;h
out a Chri&s;tian Poem than a Modern Play; there is
nothing among&s;t all the Ancient Fables or Later
Romances, that have two &s;uch Extremes united in
them, as the Eternal God becoming an Infant of
Days, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Pallace of Heaven laid to
<PB REF="6">
Sleep in a Manger, the Holy <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who knew no
Sin bearing the Sins of Men in his Body on the
Tree, Agonies of Sorrow loading the Soul of him
who was God over all Ble&s;&s;ed for ever; and the So|veraign
of Life &s;tretching his Arms on a Cro&s;s,
Bleeding and Expiring: The Heaven and the Hell
in our Divinity are infinitely more delightful and
dreadful than the Childi&s;h Figments of a Dog with
three Heads, the Buckets of the <HI>Belides,</HI> the Furies
with Snaky Hairs, or all the Flow'ry Stories of <HI>Ely|&s;ium.</HI>
Aud if we &s;urvey the one as Themes Divinely
True, and the other as a Medly of Fooleries which
we can never believe, the advantage for touching the
Springs of Pa&s;&s;ion will fall infinitely on the &s;ide of
the Chri&s;tian Poet; our Wonder and our Love, our
Pity, Delight, and Sorrow, with the long train of
Hopes and Fears, mu&s;t needs be under the Command
of an Harmonious Pen, who&s;e every Line makes a
part of the Reader's Faith, and is the very Life or
Death of his Soul.</P>
<P>If the trifling and incredible Tales that furni&s;h out
a Tragedy are &s;o arm'd by Wit and Fancy as to be|come
Soveraign of the Rational Powers, to triumph
over all the Affections, and manage our Smiles and
our Tears at plea&s;ure; how wondrous a Conque&s;t
might be obtain'd over a wild World, and reduce it
at lea&s;t to Sobriety, if the &s;ame Happy Talent were
employed in dre&s;&s;ing the Scenes of Religion in their
proper Figures of Maje&s;ty, Beauty and Terror. The
Affairs of this Life with their reference to a Life to
come, would &s;hine bright in a Dramatick De&s;cripti|on.
The Angui&s;h of inward Guilt, the &s;ecret Stings
<PB REF="7">
and Racks and Scourges of Con&s;cience, the &s;weet re|tiring
Hours and Seraphical Joys of Devotion, the
Victory of a Re&s;olved Soul over a thou&s;and Temp|tations,
the Inimitable Love and Pa&s;&s;ion of a Dying
God, the Awful Glories of the la&s;t Tribunal, the
grand Deci&s;ive Sentence from which there is no Ap|peal,
and the Con&s;equent Tran&s;ports or Horrors of
the two Eternal Worlds. How would &s;uch a Per|formance
call back the dying Piety of the Nation to
Life and Beauty: It would make Religion appear
like it &s;elf, and confound the Bla&s;phemies of a pro|fligate
World, ignorant of Pious Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But we have rea&s;on to fear that the Tuneful Men
of our Day have not rais'd their Ambition to &s;o Di|vine
a Pitch; I &s;hould rejoyce to &s;ee more of this
Coele&s;tial Fire kindling within them, for the Fla&s;hes
that break out in &s;ome pre&s;ent and pa&s;t Writings be|tray
an Infernal Source. This the Incomparable
Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> in the latter End of his Preface, and the
Ingenious Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI> in the beginning of
his have &s;o pathetically de&s;crib'd and lamented; and
I rather refer the Reader to mourn with them than
detain and tire him here. The&s;e Gentlemen in their
large and laboured Works of Poe&s;ie have given the
World happy Examples of what they wi&s;h and in|courage
in Pro&s;e: The One in a rich Variety of
Thought and Fancy; the Other in all the Beauties
of Profu&s;e and Florid Diction.</P>
<P>If &s;horter Sonnets were compos'd on &s;ublime Sub|jects,
&s;uch as the P&s;alms of <HI>David,</HI> and the Holy
Tran&s;ports inter&s;pers'd in the other Sacred Writings,
or &s;uch as the Moral Odes of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the An|cient
<PB REF="8">
<HI>Lyricks,</HI> I per&s;wade my &s;elf that the Chri&s;tian
Preacher would find abundant Aid from the Poet in
his De&s;ign to diffu&s;e Vertue and allure Souls to
God. If the Heart were fir&s;t inflam'd from Hea|ven,
and the Mu&s;e were not left alone to form the
Devotion and pur&s;ue a Cold Scent, but only call'd in
as an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Wor&s;hip, then the Song would
end where the In&s;piration cea&s;es; the whole Com|po&s;ure
would be of a Piece, all Meridian Light and
Meridian Fervor. And the &s;ame Pious Flame would
be propagated and kept glowing in the Heart of him
that reads. Some of the &s;horter Odes of the two
Poets now mentioned, and a few of the Reverend
Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s E&s;&s;ays in Ver&s;e are convincing In&s;tances
of the Succe&s;s of this Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>'Tis my Opinion al&s;o that the free and unconfin'd
Mea&s;ures of <HI>Pindar</HI> would be&s;t maintain the Digni|ty
of the Theme, as well as give a loo&s;e to the De|vout
Soul, nor check the Raptures of her Faith and
Love. Tho' in my feeble Attempts of this kind I
have mo&s;t unhappily fetter'd my Thoughts in the
narrow Numbers of our Old P&s;alm-Tran&s;lators, I
have contracted and cramp't the Sen&s;e, or render'd
it ob&s;cure and feeble by the too &s;peedy and regular
returns of Rhime.</P>
<P>If my Friends expect a particular account of this
or any other Circum&s;tance relating to what I here
Publi&s;h, they will be pleas'd to accept of this &s;hort
one.</P>
<PB REF="9">
<LIST>
<LABEL>The TITLE</LABEL>
<ITEM>A&s;&s;ures them that Poe&s;y is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my
Life, and if I &s;eized tho&s;e Hours of Lei&s;ure wherein
my Soul was in a more &s;prightly and tuneful Frame
to entertain them or my &s;elf with a Divine or Moral
Song, I hope I &s;hall find an Ea&s;y Pardon.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The SONGS Sacred
to DEVOTION</LABEL>
<ITEM>Were never written with a de&s;ign to appear before
the Judges of Wit, but only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Meditations
and Wor&s;hip of Vulgar Chri&s;tians, to whom the Mea|&s;ures
of <HI>Hopkins</HI> by Cu&s;tom are grown Familiar and
Natural, and e&s;teemed almo&s;t Sacred by being bound
up in the &s;ame Volume with Scripture. The&s;e are
but a &s;mall part of two hundred Hymns of the &s;ame
kind which are ready for Public U&s;e if the World
receive favourably what I now pre&s;ent. The Rea|&s;on
that &s;ent the&s;e out fir&s;t, and divided them from
their Fellows, is, that in mo&s;t of The&s;e there are
&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which are not &s;uited to the plain|e&s;t
Capacities, and differ too much from the u&s;ual
<PB REF="10">
Methods of Speech in which Holy Things are pro|pos'd
to the general Part of Mankind.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The ODES to VER|TUE <HI>&amp;c.</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM>Were form'd when the Frame and Humour of my
Soul was ju&s;t &s;uited to the Subject of my Ver&s;e:
The Image of my Heart is painted in them; and if
they meet with a Reader who&s;e Soul is akin to mine,
perhaps they may agreeably entertain him. The
Dullne&s;s of the Fancy and Coar&s;ene&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion
will di&s;appear, the &s;amene&s;s of the Humour will
create a Plea&s;ure, and in&s;en&s;ibly overcome and con|ceal
the Defects of the Mu&s;e.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The IMITATIONS</LABEL>
<ITEM>Of that Noble&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> Poet of Modern Ages <HI>Ca&s;i|mire
Sarbiewski</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> would need no Excu&s;e,
did they but ari&s;e to the Beauty of the Original. I
have often taken the Freedom to add ten or twenty
Lines, or to leave out as many, that I might &s;uit my
Song more to my own De&s;ign, or becau&s;e I found it
Impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;ent the Force, the Finene&s;s, and
<PB REF="11">
the Fire of his Expre&s;&s;ion in our Language. I wi&s;h
&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pen would import &s;ome of the Trea|&s;ures
of that rich Genius and ble&s;s our Nation.</ITEM>

<LABEL>The INSCRIPTIONS</LABEL>
<ITEM>To particular Friends are warranted and defended
by the Practi&s;e of the two be&s;t <HI>Lyric</HI> Writers <HI>Horace</HI>
and <HI>Ca&s;imire</HI>: And tho' the Authority of the fir&s;t be
more Venerable, yet if in &s;ome In&s;tances I prefer the
latter, I pray the Criticks to forgive me; and I hope
my Friends will excu&s;e the Freedom of the Ad|dre&s;s.</ITEM>

<LABEL>In the POEMS of HE|ROIC
Mea&s;ure</LABEL>
<ITEM>I have attempted in Rhime the &s;ame variety of Ca|dence,
Comma, and Period, which Blank Ver&s;e
Glories in as its peculiar Elegance and Orna|ment.</ITEM>

<PB REF="12">

<LABEL>In the PINDARIQUES</LABEL>
<ITEM>I have generally conformed my Lines to the &s;horter
Size of the Ancients, and avoided to imitate the Ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Lengths to which &s;ome Modern Writers have
&s;tretched their Sentences, and e&s;pecially the conclu|ding
Ver&s;e. In the&s;e the Ear is the true&s;t Judge,
nor was it made to be en&s;lav'd to any preci&s;e Model
of Elder or Later Times.</ITEM>
</LIST>

<P>After all, I mu&s;t petition my Reader to lay a&s;ide
the &s;owr and &s;ullen Air of Critici&s;m, and to a&s;&s;ume
the Friend. Let him come with a de&s;ign to be en|tertain'd
and pleas'd, rather than to &s;eek his own Di&s;|gu&s;t
and Aver&s;ion, which will not be hard to find.
I am not &s;o Vain as to think there are no Faults, nor
&s;o Blind as to e&s;py none: There is not one Copy that
intirely plea&s;es me: The be&s;t of them &s;inks va&s;tly
below the Idea which I form of a Divine or Moral
Ode. He that deals in the My&s;teries of Heaven, or
of the Mu&s;es &s;hould be a Genius of no Vulgar Mould;
and as the Name of <HI>Vates</HI> belongs to both, &s;o the
Furniture of Both is compriz'd in that Line of <HI>Ho|race,</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Cui Mens Divinior, atque Os</L>
<L>Magna Locuturum&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB REF="13">
But what <HI>Juvenal</HI> &s;pake in his Age abides true in
ours: A compleat Poet or a Prophet is &s;uch an one
<Q>&mdash;Qualem nequeo mon&s;trare, &amp; &s;entio tant&ugrave;m.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps neither of the&s;e Characters in Perfection
&s;hall ever be &s;een on Earth, till the Seventh Angel
has &s;ounded his Awful Trumpet, till the Victory be
compleat over the Bea&s;t and his Image; when the
Natives of Heaven &s;hall joyn in Triumphal Con&s;ort
with Prophets and Tuneful Saints, and Sing unto
their Golden Harps, <HI>Salvation Honour and Glory to
him that &s;its upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I been a common Mourner at the Funeral of
the Dear Gentleman decea&s;ed, I &s;hould have
labour'd after more of Art in the following
Compo&s;ition to &s;upply the defect of Nature and to feign
<PB N="220" REF="240">
a Sorrow; but the uncommon Conde&s;cen&s;ion of his
Friend&s;hip to Me, the Inward E&s;teem I pay his Me|mory,
and the va&s;t and tender Sence I have of our
Lo&s;s make all the Methods of Art needle&s;s, whil&s;t na|tural
Grief &s;upplies more than all.</P>
<P>I had re&s;olv'd indeed to lament in Sighs and Silence,
and frequently check'd the forward Mu&s;e when &s;he
brought me Grief in Numbers, and urg'd me to a tune|ful
Mourning; but the Importunity was not to be re|&s;i&s;ted:
Long Lines of Sorrow flow'd in upon my Fancy
'ere I was aware, whil&s;t I took many a Solitary Walk
in the Garden adjoyning to his Seat at <HI>Newington</HI>:
Nor could I free my &s;elf from the Melancholy Idea's
that crowded them&s;elves upon me, and your Lady&s;hip
will find throughout the Poem that the fair and unfi|ni&s;h'd
Building which he had ju&s;t rai&s;ed for him&s;elf
gave almo&s;t all the turns of Mourning to my Thoughts,
for I pur&s;ue no other Topicks of Elegy then what my
Pa&s;&s;ion and my Sen&s;es led me to.</P>
<P>The Poem roves as my Eyes and Thoughts did, from
one part of the Fabrick to the other: It ri&s;es from the
Foundation, &s;alutes the Walls, the Doors, and the
Windows, drops a Tear upon the Roof, and climbs the
Turret that dear Retreat, where I promis'd my &s;elf
many &s;weet Hours of his Conver&s;ation; there my Song
wanders among&s;t the delightful Subjects Divine and
Moral which u&s;ed to Entertain our happy lei&s;ure, and
thence flings her &s;elf down to the Fields and the Shady
Walks where I &s;o often injoy'd his plea&s;ing Di&s;cour&s;e,
and my Sorrows diffu&s;e them&s;elves there without a limit:
<PB N="221" REF="241">
I had quite forgotten what I was writing, till I correct
my &s;elf and ri&s;e to the Turret again to lament that De|&s;olate
Seat, and how vainly &s;hines the Golden Ball
that Crowns it: Thus I have written without rule and
with a negligence becoming Woe unfeigned.</P>
<P>Had I de&s;ign'd a compleat Elegy on your Deare&s;t
Brother and intended it for publick View, I &s;hould
have followed the u&s;ual Forms of Poetry, &s;pent whole
Pages in the Character and Prai&s;es of the Decea&s;ed,
and thence took occa&s;ion to call Mankind to Complain
aloud of the Univer&s;al and Un&s;peakable Lo&s;s: But I
wrote meerly for my &s;elf as a Friend of the Dead and
to ea&s;e my full Soul by breathing out my own Com|plaint:
I knew his Character and Vertues &s;o well that
there was no need to mention 'em while I talk'd only
with my &s;elf, for the Image of them was ever pre&s;ent
with me, which kept my Sorrow lively and my Tears
flowing with my Numbers.</P>
<P>Perhaps your Lady&s;hip will expect &s;ome Divine
Thoughts and Sacred Meditations mingled with a Sub|ject
&s;o &s;olemn as this is: Had I form'd a De&s;ign of
offering it to your Hands I had compos'd a more Chri|&s;tian
Poem: But 'twas Grief purely natural for a Death
&s;o &s;urprizing that drew all the Lines of it, and there|fore
my highe&s;t Reflections are but of a Moral Strain;
Such as it is, your Lady&s;hip requires a Copy of it, but
let it not touch your Soul too tenderly, nor renew your
own Mournings. Receive it, <HI>Madam,</HI> as a Sacrifice
of Love and Tears offer'd at the Tomb of a Departed
Friend, and let it abide with you as a Witne&s;s of that
<PB N="222" REF="242">
Affectionate Re&s;pect and Honour that I bore him, all
which as your Lady&s;hips mo&s;t rightful Due both by Me|rit
and Succe&s;&s;ion, is now humbly offered by</P>
