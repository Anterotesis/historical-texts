<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN XVII. v. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>This is Life Eternal, that they may
know Thee the only true God, and
Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THAT human kind were not
de&s;igned merely to &s;ojourn a
few Days upon this Earth: that
a Being of &s;uch Excellence as
the Soul of Man, &s;o capable of a nobler
Life, and having &s;uch a high Sen&s;e of
Things moral and intellectual, was not crea|ted
in the &s;ole View of being impri&s;oned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few
Pains and Plea&s;ures which chequer this mor|tal
Life, without a&s;piring to any thing ei|ther
above or beyond it, is a Fundamental
Doctrine as well of Natural Religion as of
the Chri&s;tian. It comes at once recom|mended
<PB N="4" REF="4">
by the Authority of Philo&s;o|phers
and Evangeli&s;ts. And that there ac|tually
is in the Mind of Man a &s;trong in|&s;tinct
and de&s;ire, an appetite and tendency
towards another and a better State, income|parably
&s;uperior to the pre&s;ent, both in
point of Happine&s;s and Duration, is no
more than every one's Experience and in|ward
Feeling may inform him. The &s;a|tiety
and di&s;reli&s;h attending &s;en&s;ual Enjoy|ments,
the reli&s;h for things of a more pure
and &s;piritual kind, the re&s;tle&s;s Motion of
the Mind, from one terrene Object of pur|&s;uit
to another, and often a Flight or Endea|vour
above them all towards &s;omething un|known,
and perfective of its Nature, are &s;o
many &s;igns and tokens of this better State,
which in the Style of the Go&s;pel is termed
Life Eternal.</P>
<P>AND as this is the greate&s;t Good that
can befal us, the very end of our Being,
and that alone which can crown and &s;atisfy
our Wi&s;hes, and without which we &s;hall be
ever re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; &s;o every Man,
who knows and acts up to his true Inte|re&s;t,
mu&s;t make it his principal Care and
Study to obtain it: And in order to this,
he mu&s;t endeavour to live &s;uitably to his
Calling, and of con&s;equence endeavour to
<PB N="5" REF="5">
make others obtain it too. For how can
a Chri&s;tian &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of his Cal|ling,
otherwi&s;e than by performing the Du|ties
of it? And what Chri&s;tian Duty is
more e&s;&s;entially &s;o, than that of Charity?
And what Object can be found upon Earth
more de&s;erving our Charity, than the Souls
of Men? Or, how is it po&s;&s;ible for the
mo&s;t beneficent Spirit to do them better
Service, than by promoting their be&s;t and
mo&s;t la&s;ting Intere&s;t, that is by putting
them in the Way that leads to Eternal
Life.</P>
<P>WHAT this Eternal Life was, or how
to come at it, were Points unknown to the
Heathen World. It mu&s;t be owned, the
wi&s;e Men of Old, who followed the Light
of Nature, &s;aw even by that Light, that
the Soul of Man was deba&s;ed, and born
downwards, contrary to its natural Bent,
by carnal and terrene Objects; and that,
on the other hand, it was exalted, purged,
and in &s;ome &s;ort a&s;&s;imulated to the Deity,
by the Contemplation of Truth and Prac|tice
of Virtue. Thus much in general they
&s;aw or &s;urmi&s;ed. But then about the Way
and Means to know the one, or perform
the other, they were much at a lo&s;s. They
were not agreed concerning the true End
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of Mankind; which, as they &s;aw, was mi&s;|taken
in the vulgar Pur&s;uits of Men; &s;o
they found it much more ea&s;y to confute
the Errors of others, than to a&s;certain the
Truth them&s;elves. Hence &s;o many Divi|&s;ions
and Di&s;putes about a Point which it
mo&s;t imported them to know, in&s;omuch as
it was to give the Bias to human Life, and
govern the whole Tenor of their Actions
and Conduct.</P>
<P>BUT when Life and Immortality were
brought to Light by the Go&s;pel, there could
remain no Di&s;pute about the chief End and
Felicity of Man, no more than there could
about the Means of obtaining it, afer the
expre&s;s Declaration of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <HI>This is Life eter|nal,
that they may know thee, the only true
God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI>
For the right under&s;tanding of which Words
we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that by the Knowledge
of God, is not meant a barren Speculation,
either of Philo&s;ophers or Schola&s;tic Divines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Di&s;putes and Di&s;&s;entions among Men; but,
on the contrary, an holy practical Know|ledge,
which is the Source, the Root, or
Principle of Peace and Union, of Faith,
Hope, Charity, and univer&s;al Obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
A Man may frame the mo&s;t accurate Notions,
and in one Sen&s;e attain the exacte&s;t Know|ledge
of God and Chri&s;t that human Fa|culties
can reach, and yet, notwith&s;tanding
all this, be far from knowing them in that
&s;aving Sen&s;e. For St. <HI>John</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. iii. 6.</NOTE> that
<HI>who&s;oever &s;inneth, hath not &s;een Chri&s;t, nor
known him.</HI> And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. iv. 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</HI> To know God as we
ought, we mu&s;t love him; and love him
&s;o as withal to love our Brethren, his Crea|tures,
and his Children. I &s;ay that Know|ledge
of God and Chri&s;t, which is Life
eternal, implies univer&s;al Charity, with all
the Duties ingrafted thereon, or en&s;uing
from thence, that is to &s;ay, the Love of
God and Man. And our Lord expre&s;ly
&s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xiv. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He that hath my Commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> From
all which it is evident, that this &s;aving
Knowledge of God is in&s;eparable from
the Knowledge and Practice of his Will;
the explicit Declaration whereof, and of
the Means to perform it, are contained
in the Go&s;pel, that divine In&s;trument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men.
The metaphy&s;ical Knowledge of God,
con&s;idered in his ab&s;olute Nature of E&s;|&s;ence,
is one thing, and to know him as
<PB N="8" REF="8">
he &s;tands related to us as Creator, Re|deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The
former kind of Knowledge (whatever it
amounts to) hath been, and may be, in
Gentiles as well as Chri&s;tians, but not the
latter, which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid, it is a plain
Con&s;equence, that whoever is a &s;incere
Chri&s;tian, cannot be indifferent about
bringing over other Men to the Know|ledge
of God and Chri&s;t; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that
Title, is indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged in Duty to
God, and in Charity to his Neighbour, to
de&s;ire and promote, &s;o far as there is Op|portunity,
the Conver&s;ion of Heathen and
Infidels, that &s;o they may become Parta|kers
of Life and Immortality. For, <HI>this
is Life eternal, to know thee the only true
God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>IN my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e upon which
Words; I &s;hall,<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> CONSIDER in general, the Obli|gation
that Chri&s;tians lie under, of
bringing other Men to the Knowledge
of the only true God, and of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="9"><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider it in Reference
to this laudable Society, in&s;tituted for
the Propagation of the Go&s;pel. And
under each Head, I propo&s;e to obviate
&s;uch Difficulties as may &s;eem to re|tard,
and intermix &s;uch Remarks as
&s;hall appear proper to forward &s;o
good a Work.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>NOW although it be very evident, that
we can really have neither a ju&s;t Zeal for
the Glory of God, nor a beneficent Love
of Man, without wi&s;hing and endeavour|ing,
as occa&s;ion &s;erves, to &s;pread the glad
Tidings of Salvation, and bring tho&s;e who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to
Life eternal, by the Knowledge of the only
true God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he
hath &s;ent. Yet this Duty, plain and un|doubted
as it &s;eems, happens to be too of|ten
overlooked, even by tho&s;e, who&s;e At|tention
to other Points would make one
think their Neglect of this, not an Effect
of lukewarm Indifference, &s;o much as of
certain mi&s;taken Notions and Suppo&s;itions.
Two principal Con&s;iderations occur, which,
in this particular, &s;eem to have &s;lackened
<PB N="10" REF="10">
the Indu&s;try of &s;ome, otherwi&s;e zealous and
&s;erious Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>ONE I apprehend to be this, that it is
&s;urmi&s;ed, the Chri&s;tian Religion is in a
declining State, which by many Symptoms
&s;eems likely to end either in Popery, or a
general Infidelity. And that of Cour&s;e a
prudent Per&s;on has nothing to do, but to
make &s;ure of his own Salvation, and to
acquie&s;ce in the general Tendency of things,
without being at any fruitle&s;s Pains to op|po&s;e
what cannot be prevented, to &s;teer
again&s;t the Stream, or re&s;i&s;t a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and
Rapidity, and in the End, will be &s;ure to
overflow, and carry all before it. When
a Man of a de&s;ponding and foreboding
Spirit hath been led, by his ob&s;ervation of
the Ways of the World, and the prevail|ing
Humour of our Times, to think af|ter
this manner; he will be inclined to
&s;trengthen this his preconceived Opinion,
as is u&s;ual in other the like Ca&s;es, by Mi&s;|application
of holy Scripture: For in|&s;tance,
by tho&s;e Words of our Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xviii. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>When the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall
he find Faith upon Earth?</HI> which have
been applied to this very purpo&s;e, as im|porting
that before the final Judgment,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Chri&s;tian Faith &s;hould be extingui&s;hed up|on
Earth; Although the&s;e Words do, from
the Context, &s;eem plainly to refer to the
De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the ob&s;ti|nate
Blindne&s;s of the Jews, who even
then when they felt the Hand of God,
&s;hould not acknowledge it, or believe the
<HI>Roman</HI> Army to be the In&s;trument of Di|vine
Vengeance, in the Day of their Vi|&s;itation,
by him whom they had injuri|ou&s;ly
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</P>
<P>BUT, granting the former Sen&s;e might
be &s;upported by no ab&s;urd Hypothe&s;is, or
no improbable Gue&s;s; yet &s;hall the En|deavours
of Chri&s;tian Men for propaga|ting
the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t be fore&s;talled
by any Suppo&s;itions or Conjectures what|&s;oever?
admitting, I &s;ay, tho&s;e Words
regard the future Advent of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
yet can any one tell how near or how far
off that Advent may be? Are not the Times
and Sea&s;ons foreknown only to God? And
&s;hall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmi&s;e of what is to come
hereafter? This way of thinking might
furni&s;h as &s;trong Rea&s;ons again&s;t Preaching
at home, as abroad, within, as without the
Pale of the Church. It would be as &s;peci|ous
an Argument again&s;t the one as the o|ther,
<PB N="12" REF="12">
but in reality can conclude again&s;t nei|ther.
For, as we know not when that &s;up|po&s;ed
Time of general Infidelity is to be, or
whether it will be at all; &s;o, if it were
ever &s;o &s;ure, and ever &s;o near, it would ne|verthele&s;s
become us to take Care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particu|lar
Indifference and Neglect.</P>
<P>BUT if we take our Notions, not from
the uncertain Interpretation of a particular
Text, but from the whole Tenor of the di|vine
Oracles, from the expre&s;s Promi&s;e and
reiterated Predictions of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord,
and his Apo&s;tles, we &s;hall believe, that
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE><HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is highly exalted of God, to the
End,
that at his Name every Knee &s;hall
bow, and every Tongue confe&s;s that he is the
Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI> That
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xv. 25.</NOTE><HI>he mu&s;t Reign till he hath put all Enemies
under his Feet.</HI>
That <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxviii. 20.</NOTE><HI>He is with us alway,
even unto the End of the World.</HI>
And that,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xvi. 18.</NOTE><HI>The Church of the living God, the pillar and
ground of Truth, is &s;o far from being de|&s;troy'd
human Means,
that the gates of
Hell</HI> (all the infernal Powers) <HI>&s;hall not pre|vail
again&s;t it.</HI> Let us therefore bani&s;h all
&s;uch Conceits as may &s;eem to ju&s;tifie our In|dolence,
as may rea&s;on us out of all courage
and vigour in the Race that is &s;et before
<PB N="13" REF="13">
us; let us not, I &s;ay, &s;lacken our own Hands,
nor enfeeble our own Knees, by preconceiv|ed
Fancies and Suppo&s;itions, con&s;idering
that as the Succe&s;s of all Enterpri&s;es in
great Mea&s;ure depends on the Spirit of the
Undertakers, &s;o nothing is more apt to rai&s;e
a Spirit than Hope; or to depre&s;s it, than
De&s;pondency. We ought therefore to &s;hake
off every vain Fear in our &s;piritual Warfare.
The Number, the Pre&s;umption, and the
Abilities of tho&s;e, who take Coun&s;el toge|ther
again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his A|nointed,
&s;hould not di&s;hearten, but rather
excite and encourage us to &s;tand in the Gap.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Con&s;ideration, that may po&s;|&s;ibly
withhold divers &s;incere Believers from
contributing their Endeavours for bring|ing
Men to the Knowledge of God and
Chri&s;t, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the pre&s;ent Age. Men
naturally ca&s;t about for Rea&s;ons to counte|nance
the Part they take. And as the Gift
of Miracles was of mighty Influence and
Help to tho&s;e, who were commi&s;&s;ioned to
&s;pread abroad the Light of the Go&s;pel in
its fir&s;t promulgation, &s;o no Pretence offers
it &s;elf more naturally to excu&s;e a Man
from executing any purpo&s;e, than the want
of Authority, which, in the Opinion of
<PB N="14" REF="14">
Men, cannot be without a ju&s;t Commi&s;|&s;ion,
nor this unle&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e
proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to
this defect of Miracles, I &s;hall beg leave to
make two Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is to be ob&s;erved, that if we have
not Miracles, we have other Advantages
which make them le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary now, than
in the fir&s;t &s;preading of the Go&s;pel: Whole
Nations have found the Benefit of Chri&s;t's
Religion, it is protected by Princes, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
and encouraged by Laws, &s;upported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by
the Experience of many Ages, as well as
by the Authority and Example of the wi|&s;e&s;t
and mo&s;t knowing Men. Certainly,
if the greater Part of Mankind are Gen|tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied
that the mo&s;t knowing, mo&s;t learned, and
mo&s;t improved Nations, profe&s;s Chri&s;tia|nity,
and that even the Mahometans them|&s;elves
bear Te&s;timony to the Divine Mi&s;|&s;ion
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wan|derers,
of the meane&s;t of the People, had
the Prejudices, the Learning, and the Pow|er
of their own, as well as other Nations,
in one Word, the whole World, to oppo&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="15">
and overcome: Tho&s;e who at this Day en|gage
in the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, do
it upon Terms in many Re&s;pects far more
ea&s;y and advantageous. It is Power again&s;t
Weakne&s;s, Civility again&s;t Barbari&s;m, Know|ledge
again&s;t Ignorance, &s;ome or other, if
not all the&s;e Advantages, in the pre&s;ent
Times, attending the Progre&s;s of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion, in whatever Part of the
World Men &s;hall attempt to plant it.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd Place we may reflect, that
if we have not the Gift of Miracles, this
is a good Rea&s;on why we &s;hould exert
more &s;trongly tho&s;e human Means which
God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the
Head, or the Hand, or the Tongue, our
Intere&s;t, our Credit, or our Fortune, &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the great Giver of them; and
chearfully contribute our humble Mite to|wards
ha&s;tening that Time,
wherein <NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm lxxxvi. 9.</NOTE><HI>all
Nations whom thou ha&s;t made, &s;hall come
and wor&s;hip before thee, O Lord, and &s;hall
glorifie thy Name.</HI> It is at lea&s;t a plain
Ca&s;e, that the Want of Apo&s;tolical Gifts
&s;hould not be pleaded as a Bar to our
doing that, which in no Re&s;pect, either
of Difficulty or Danger, equals, or ap|proaches
the Apo&s;tolical Office. What
<PB N="16" REF="16">
Pretence can this &s;upply for Mens being
quite unconcerned about the &s;preading of
the Go&s;pel, or the Salvation of Souls? For
Mens forgetting that they are Chri&s;tians,
and related to human Kind? How can
this ju&s;tify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not con|tributing
a &s;mall Part of their Fortune
towards forwarding a De&s;ign, wherein they
&s;hare neither Pains nor Peril; the not be|&s;towing
on it, even the cheap A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of their Speech, Attention, Coun&s;el, or
Countenance, as Occa&s;ion offers? How un|like
is this worldly, &s;elfi&s;h Indifference, to
that Account which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of him|&s;elf,
that <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. x. 33.</NOTE><HI>he &s;ought not his own the Profit, but
the Profit of many, that they may be &s;aved.</HI>
And yet herein he expected the <HI>Corinthi|ans</HI>
(and the &s;ame Rea&s;on will hold for
us) &s;hould be like him; for he &s;ubjoins, <HI>Be
ye Followers of me as I al&s;o am of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered the Duty in gene|ral,
I come now to treat of it with Refe|rence
to <HI>America,</HI> the peculiar Province of
this Venerable Society; which I &s;uppo&s;e
well informed of the State and Progre&s;s of
Religion in that part of the World, by
their Corre&s;pondencies with the Clergy
upon their Mi&s;&s;ion. It may neverthele&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="17">
be expected that one who had been engaged
in a De&s;ign in this very View, who hath
been upon the Place, and re&s;ided a con&s;i|derable
Time in one of our Colonies, &s;hould
have ob&s;erved &s;omewhat worth reporting.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that one Part
of my Audience will pardon, what the
other may, perhaps, expect, while I detain
them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have ob&s;erved, and &s;uch Reflections as
thereupon &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves; &s;ome
part of which may po&s;&s;ibly be found to
extend to other Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> with a Portion of the ad|jacent
Continent, under the &s;ame Govern|ment,
is inhabited by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony,
con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Sectaries of many differ|ent
Denominations, who &s;eem to have worn
off part of that Prejudice, which they inhe|rited
from their Ance&s;tors, again&s;t the Na|tional
Church of this Land; though it
mu&s;t be acknowledged at the &s;ame Time,
that too many of them have worn off a
&s;erious Sen&s;e of all Religion. Several in|deed
of the better Sort are accu&s;tomed to
a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves regularly on the Lord's
Day for the Performance of Divine Wor|&s;hip.
But mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who are di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="18">
throughout this Colony, &s;eem to rival
&s;ome well-bred People of other Countries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is
&s;acred, being equally carele&s;s of outward
Wor&s;hip, and of inward Principles, whe|ther
of Faith or Practice. Of the Bulk
of them it may certainly be &s;aid, that
they live without the Sacraments, not be|ing
&s;o much as baptized: And as for their
Morals, I apprehend there is nothing to
be found in them that &s;hould tempt others
to make an Experiment of their Principles,
either in Religion or Government. But
it mu&s;t be owned, the general Behaviour
of the Inhabitants in tho&s;e Towns where
Churches and Meetings have been long
&s;ettled, and regularly attended, &s;eems &s;o
much better, as &s;ufficiently to &s;hew the
Difference, which a &s;olemn regular Wor&s;hip
of God makes between Per&s;ons of the &s;ame
Blood, Temper, and natural Faculties.</P>
<P>THE native Indians, who are &s;aid to
have been formerly many Thou&s;ands, with|in
the compa&s;s of this Colony, do not at
pre&s;ent amount to one Thou&s;and, includ|ing
every Age and Sex. And the&s;e are
all either Servants or Labourers for the
Engli&s;h, who have contributed more to
de&s;troy their Bodies by the U&s;e of &s;trong
<PB N="19" REF="19">
Liquors, than by any Means to improve
their Minds, or &s;ave their Souls. This
&s;low Poi&s;on, jointly operating with the
Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much
more de&s;tructive than both) hath con&s;u|med
the Indians, not only in our Colonies,
but al&s;o far and wide upon our Confines.
And having made Havock of them, is
now doing the &s;ame Thing by tho&s;e who
taught them that odious Vice.</P>
<P>THE Negroes in the Government of
<HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> are about half as many more
than the Indians; and both together &s;carce
amount to a &s;eventh Part of the whole
Colony. The Religion of the&s;e People,
as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, takes after that
of their Ma&s;ters. Some few are baptized;
&s;everal frequent the different A&s;&s;emblies:
and far the greater Part none at all. An
antient Antipathy to the Indians, whom,
it &s;eems, our fir&s;t Planters (therein as in
certain other Particulars affecting to imi|tate
Jews rather than Chri&s;tians) imagined
they had a Right to treat on the Foot
of <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Amalekites,</HI> together with
an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had
no Right to be in&s;tructed or admit|ted
to the Sacraments, have proved a
<PB N="20" REF="20">
main Ob&s;tacle to the Conver&s;ion of the&s;e
poor People.</P>
<P>TO this may be added, an erroneous No|tion,
that the being baptized, is incon&s;i&s;tent
with a State of Slavery. To undeceive
them in this Particular, which had too
much Weight, it &s;eemed a proper Step, if
the Opinion of his Maje&s;ty's Attorney and
Sollicitor-General could be procured. This
Opinion they charitably &s;ent over, &s;igned
with their own Hands; which was accor|dingly
printed in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and di&s;per|&s;ed
throughout the Plantations. I heartily
wi&s;h it may produce the intended Effect.
It mu&s;t be owned, our reformed Planters,
with re&s;pect to the Natives and the Slaves,
might learn from tho&s;e of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> how it is their Intere&s;t and Duty to
behave. Both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
intermarried with <HI>Indians,</HI> to the great
Strength, Security and Increa&s;e of their
Colonies. They take Care to in&s;truct both
them and their Negroes, in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Re|ligion,
to the Reproach of tho&s;e who pro|fe&s;s
a better. They have al&s;o Bi&s;hops and
Seminaries for Clergy; and it is not found
that their Colonies are wor&s;e Subjects,
or depend le&s;s on their Mother Country,
on that Account.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
IT &s;hould &s;eem, that the likelie&s;t Step
towards converting the Heathen, would be
to begin with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Planters; who&s;e
Influence will for ever be an Ob&s;tacle to
propagating the Go&s;pel, till they have a
right Sen&s;e of it them&s;elves, which would
&s;hew them how much it is their Duty to
impart it to others. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries em|ployed
by this Venerable Society have done,
and continue to do, good Service, in bring|ing
tho&s;e Planters to a &s;erious Sen&s;e of Re|ligion,
which, it is hoped, will in time ex|tend
to others. I &s;peak it knowingly, that
the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in tho&s;e Pro|vinces
which go by the Name of <HI>New-England,</HI>
&s;ent and &s;upported at the Expence
of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of
Manners, di&s;creet Behaviour, and a compe|tent
Degree of u&s;eful Knowledge, &s;hewn
them&s;elves worthy the Choice of tho&s;e who
&s;ent them; and particularly in living on a
more friendly Foot with their Brethren of
the Separation; who, on their Part, are al|&s;o
very much come off from that Narrow|ne&s;s
of Spirit, which formerly kept them
at &s;uch an unamicable Di&s;tance from us.
And as there is rea&s;on to apprehend, that
Part of <HI>America</HI> could not have been thus
di&s;tingui&s;hed, and provided with &s;uch a
<PB N="22" REF="22">
Number of proper Per&s;ons, if one half of
them had not been &s;upplied out of the di&s;|&s;enting
Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal
Improvements of Learning, are ob&s;erved to
quit their Prejudice towards an Epi&s;copal
Church; &s;o I verily think it might increa&s;e
the Number of &s;uch u&s;eful Men, if Provi|&s;ion
were made to defray their Charges in
coming hither to receive holy Orders; pa&s;|&s;ing
and repa&s;&s;ing the Ocean, and tarrying
the nece&s;&s;ary Time in <HI>London,</HI> requiring an
Expence that many are not able to bear.
It would al&s;o be an Encouragement to the
Mi&s;&s;ionaries in general, and probably pro|duce
good Effects, if the Allowance of cer|tain
Mi&s;&s;ionaries were augmented, in pro|portion
to the Service they had done, and
the Time they had &s;pent in their Mi&s;&s;ion.
The&s;e Hints I venture to &s;ugge&s;t, as not
unu&s;eful in an Age, wherein all humane
Encouragements are found more nece&s;&s;ary,
than at the fir&s;t Propagation of the Go&s;pel.
But they are, with all due Deference and
Re&s;pect, &s;ubmitted to the Judgment of this
Venerable Audience.</P>
<P>AFTER all, it is hardly to be expected,
that &s;o long as Infidelity prevails at home,
the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;hould thrive and
<PB N="23" REF="23">
flouri&s;h in our Colonies abroad. Mankind,
it mu&s;t be owned, left to them&s;elves, are &s;o
much bewildered and benighted, with re&s;pect
to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a Lo&s;s about the
Means of being freed; that the Doctrines of
the lap&s;ed State of Man, his Reconciliation
by Chri&s;t, and Regeneration by the Spirit,
may rea&s;onably be hoped to find an ea&s;y
Admi&s;&s;ion, as bringing with them Light and
Comfort, into a Mind not hardened by Im|penitency,
nor fore-clo&s;ed by Pride, nor
bias'd by Prejudice. But, &s;uch is the Va|nity
of Man, that no Prejudice operates
more powerfully than that in Favour of
Fa&s;hion; and no Fa&s;hions are &s;o much
followed by our Colonies, as tho&s;e of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt
in their Modes of living, to their great
Inconvenience, without allowing for the
Di&s;parity of Circum&s;tance or Climate.
This &s;ame Humour hath made Infidelity
(as I find it too credibly reported) &s;pread
in &s;ome of our wealthy Plantations; un|educated
Men being more apt to tread in
the Steps of Libertines and Men of Fa|&s;hion,
than to model them&s;elves by the
Laws and Institutions of their Mother
<PB N="24" REF="24">
Country, or the Lives and Profe&s;&s;ions of
the virtuous and religious Part of it.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; While tho&s;e abroad
are le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to receive, &s;ome at home
are, perhaps, le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to propagate the
Go&s;pel, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e. It is to be
feared, I &s;ay, that the prevailing Torrent
of Infidelity, which &s;taggers the Faith of
&s;ome, may cool the Zeal, and damp the
Spirit of others, who, judging from the
Event and Succe&s;s of tho&s;e, who impugn
the Church of Chri&s;t, may po&s;&s;ibly enter|tain
&s;ome Scruple or Surmi&s;e, whether it
may not be, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, aban|doned
by Providence, and that human Care
mu&s;t ineffectually interpo&s;e, till it &s;hall plea&s;e
God, <HI>yet once more to &s;hake not the Earth
only, but al&s;o the Heavens.</HI> This Point hath
been touched before, but de&s;erves farther
Con&s;ideration: to the end, that the peculiar
Impiety of a profane Age, may not be a Bar
to tho&s;e very Endeavours, which it &s;elf ren|ders
more nece&s;&s;ary, and calls for more loud|ly
now than ever.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Men may think, the Arm
of the Lord is not &s;horten'd. In all this
Prevalency of Athei&s;m and Irreligion, there
is no Advantage gained, by the Powers of
Darkne&s;s, either again&s;t God, or godly Men,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
but only again&s;t their own wretched Parti&s;ans.
The Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation is a Di&s;pen&s;ation
of Grace and Favour. The Chri&s;tian Church
a Society of Men intitled to this Grace,
on performing certain Conditions. If this
Society is dimini&s;hed, as tho&s;e who remain
true Members of it &s;uffer no Lo&s;s to them|&s;elves,
&s;o God lo&s;eth no Right, &s;uffereth no
Detriment, foregoeth no Good; his Grace
re&s;i&s;ted or unfruitful, being no more lo&s;t to
him, than the Light of the Sun &s;hining on
de&s;art Places, or among People who &s;hut
their Eyes.</P>
<P>BESIDES, this Exce&s;s, this un&s;temmed
Torrent of Profanene&s;s, may po&s;&s;ibly, in the
Conclu&s;ion, defeat it&s;elf, confirm what it
meant to extirpate, and in&s;tead of de&s;troy|ing,
prove a Means of pre&s;erving our Reli|gion;
the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being &s;o notorious and flagrant, and &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly
felt, as in all likelyhood to be able to
open the Eyes, and rou&s;e the Attention of
tho&s;e, who may be blind and deaf to every
other Argument and Con&s;ideration. Or, who
knows but the Chri&s;tian Church corrupted
by Pro&s;perity, is to be re&s;tored and purified
by Adver&s;ity? which may prove, for ought
we can tell, as &s;alutary in future, as it hath
been in pa&s;t Ages. Many in&s;olent and pre|&s;umptuous
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Foes have &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t
the Church of God; who&s;e Hook neverthe|le&s;s
may be in their No&s;trils, and his Bridle
in their Lips, managing and governing, even
their Rage and Folly, to the fulfilling of his
own wi&s;e Purpo&s;es; and who may not fail
in the End, to deal by them as he did by the
King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> when he had <HI>performed his
Work upon Sin and upon Jeru&s;alem, puni&s;h|ing
their &s;tout Heart and high Looks.</HI> This
pre&s;umptuous Conqueror was, without
knowing it, a Tool or In&s;trument in the
Hands of that God whom he bla&s;phemed.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. x. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE><HI>O A&s;&s;yrian,
the Rod of mine Anger! I will
&s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical Nation, and
again&s;t the People of my Wrath will I give
him a Charge to take the Spoil, and to take
the Prey, and to tread them down like the
Mire of the Streets. Howbeit he meaneth
not &s;o, neither doth his Heart think &s;o, but
it is in his Heart to de&s;troy and cut off Na|tions
not a few.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much at lea&s;t is evident: It is no
new Thing, that great Enormities &s;hould
produce great Humiliations, and the&s;e again
noble Vertues, which have often recovered
both &s;ingle Men, and whole States, even in a
natural and civil Sen&s;e. And if the Captivi|ties,
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and De&s;olations of the Jew|i&s;h
<PB N="27" REF="27">
Church, have occa&s;ioned their Return to
God, and rein&s;tated them in his Favour;
nay, if it was actually foretold, whenever
they lay under the Cur&s;e of God, at the
Mercy of their Enemies, peeled and &s;cat|tered
in a foreign Land, that neverthele&s;s
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxx. 3.</NOTE><HI>the Lord their God
would turn their Captivity,
and have Com|pa&s;&s;ion
upon them.</HI> I &s;ay, if Things were &s;o,
why may we not in Rea&s;on hope for &s;ome|thing
analogous thereto, in behalf of the
Chri&s;tian Church. It cannot be denied, that
there was a great Analogy between the Jew|i&s;h
In&s;titutions, and the Doctrines of the
Go&s;pel; for in&s;tance, between the Pa&s;chal
Lamb, and the Lamb of God &s;lain from the
Foundation of the World; between the <HI>E|gyptian</HI>
Bondage, and that of Sin; the earthly
<HI>Canaan,</HI> and the heavenly; the fle&s;hly Cir|cumci&s;ion, and the &s;piritual. In the&s;e and
many other Particulars, the Analogy &s;eems &s;o
plain, that it can hardly be di&s;puted. To be
convinced that the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the
Jewi&s;h Oeconomy were Figures and Sha|dows
of the Evangelical, we need only look
into the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> May we
not therefore, in pur&s;uance of this &s;ame A|nalogy,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;uppo&s;e a &s;imilar Treatment of the
Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Church?</P>
<P>LET us then &s;ee, on what Terms the
former &s;tood with God, in order to di&s;cover
what the latter may rea&s;onably expect. The
&s;olemn Denunciation to the Jews was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxviii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>If thou
&s;halt kearken diligently to the Lord thy God,
to ob&s;erve and to do all his Commandments,
which I command thee this Day, the Lord thy
God will &s;et thee on high above all the Nations
of the Earth.</HI> But in ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience,
it is added among many other Threats and
Maledictions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;mite thee
with Bla&s;ting and with Mildew: and the
Heaven that is over thy Head &s;hall be Bra&s;s,
and the Earth that is under thy Feet &s;hall be
Iron.</HI>
And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 28</NOTE> <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;mite thee
with Madne&s;s, and Blindne&s;s, and A&s;toni&s;h|ment
of Heart.</HI> Have not the People of this
Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the ju&s;t Judgments of Heaven?
Surely we have felt in a Metaphor the fir&s;t
of the forementioned Judgments; and the
la&s;t hath been literally fulfilled upon us.
Is it not vi&s;ible that we are le&s;s knowing,
le&s;s vertuous, le&s;s rea&s;onable, in proportion
as we are le&s;s religious? Are we not grown
drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity
and Pre&s;umption, and Free-thinking, and
<PB N="29" REF="29">
Extravagance of every kind? to a Degree
that we may truly be &s;aid to be <HI>&s;mitten with
Madne&s;s, and Blindne&s;s, and A&s;toni&s;hment of
Heart.</HI></P>
<P>AS antiently mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Schi&s;ms and
Di&s;putes, joined with great Corruption of
Manners, made way for the Mahometan in the
Ea&s;t, and the Papal Dominion in the
We&s;t; even &s;o here at home in the la&s;t Cen|tury,
a weak Reliance upon human Politics
and Power on the one hand, and enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
Rage on the other, together with car|nal
Mindedne&s;s on both, gave occa&s;ion to
introduce Athei&s;m and Infidelity. If the
temporal State, and outward Form of the
Jewi&s;h Church was, upon their Defection,
overturned by Invaders, in like manner, when
Chri&s;tians are no longer governed by the
Light of Evangelical Truth, when we re&s;i&s;t
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<HI>the Heaven above will be as Bra&s;s,</HI> that the
Divine Grace will no longer &s;hower down
on our obdurate Hearts, that our Church
and Profe&s;&s;ion will be bla&s;ted by licentious
Scorners, tho&s;e Madmen, who in Sport <HI>&s;cat|ter
Firebrands, Arrows and Death</HI>? As all
this is no more than we may rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;e
will en&s;ue upon our Back&s;liding, &s;o we
<PB N="30" REF="30">
may, with equal Rea&s;on, hope it will be re|medied
upon our Return to God.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid it follows,
that in order to propagate the Go&s;pel a|broad,
it is nece&s;&s;ary we do it at home, and
extend our Charity to dome&s;tic Infidels, if
we would convert or prevent foreign ones.
So that a View of the declining State of Re|ligion
here at home, of tho&s;e things that
produced this Declen&s;ion, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected
with the Subject of this Di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall
therefore beg your Patience, while I ju&s;t
mention a few Remarks or Hints, too ob|vious,
perhaps, in them&s;elves to be new or
unknown to any pre&s;ent, but too little vi|&s;ible
in their Effects, to make one think
they are, by all, much attended to.</P>
<P>SOME, preferring Points notional or ri|tual
to the Love of God and Man, con&s;ider
the National Church only as it &s;tands oppo|&s;ed
to other Chri&s;tian Societies. The&s;e ge|nerally
have a Zeal without Knowledge, and
the Effects are &s;uitable to the Cau&s;e; they
really hurt what they &s;eem to e&s;pou&s;e. O|thers
more &s;olicitous about the Di&s;covery
of Truth, than the Practice of Holine&s;s,
employ them&s;elves, rather to &s;py out Er|rors
in the Church, than enforce its Pre|cepts.
<PB N="31" REF="31">
The&s;e, it is to be feared, po&s;tpone
the great Intere&s;ts of Religion to Points of
le&s;s Concern, in any Eyes but their own.
But &s;urely they would do well to con&s;ider,
that an humble, though confu&s;ed or indi|&s;tinct,
Faith in the Bond of Charity, and
productive of good Works, is much more
Evangelical than an accurate di&s;puting and
conceited Knowledge.</P>
<P>A Church which contains the Fundamen|tals,
and nothing &s;ubver&s;ive of tho&s;e Fun|damentals,
is not to be &s;et at naught by any
particular Member; becau&s;e it may not, in
every Point, perhaps, corre&s;pond with his
Ideas, no not, though he is &s;ure of being
in the right. Probably there never was, or
will be, an e&s;tabli&s;hed Church in this World,
without vi&s;ible Marks of Humanity upon
it. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">x Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE> that <HI>on the Foun|dation
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
there will be human
Super&s;tructures of Hay and Stubble,</HI> things
light and trivial, wrong or &s;uper&s;titious,
which indeed is a natural Con&s;equence of
the Weakne&s;s and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid
in the Mind, there will not fail to grow and
&s;pring from thence tho&s;e Vertues and Gra|ces,
which are the genuine Effects and To|kens
of true Faith, and which are by no
<PB N="32" REF="32">
means incon&s;i&s;tent with every Error in The|ory,
or every needle&s;s Rite in Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Religion was calculated
for the Bulk of Mankind, and therefore
cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in
&s;ubtle and nice Notions. From the time
that Divinity was con&s;idered as a Science,
and human Rea&s;on enthroned in the San|ctuary
of God, the Hearts of its Profe&s;&s;ors
&s;eem to have been le&s;s under the Influence
of Grace. From that time have grown ma|ny
unchri&s;tian Di&s;&s;entions and Controver&s;ies,
of Men <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. vi. 4.</NOTE><HI>knowing nothing,
but doating about
Que&s;tions and Strife of Words, whereof com|eth
Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Surmi&s;es, per|ver&s;e
Di&s;putings of Men of corrupt Minds,
and de&s;titute of Truth.</HI> Doubtle&s;s, the ma|king
Religion a notional Thing, hath been
of infinite Di&s;&s;ervice. And whereas its ho|ly
My&s;teries are rather to be received with
Humility of Faith, than defined and mea|&s;ured
by the accuracy of human Rea&s;on; all
Attempts of this kind, however well inten|ded,
have vi&s;ibly failed in the Event; and
in&s;tead of reconciling Infidels, have, by cre|ating
Di&s;putes and Heats among the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
of Chri&s;tianity, given no &s;mall Ad|vantage
to its Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33">
TO conclude, if we proportioned our
Zeal to the Importance of Things: If we
could love Men who&s;e Opinions we do not
approve: If we knew the World more,
and liked it le&s;s: If we had a due Sen&s;e
of the Divine Perfection and our own De|fects:
If our chief Study was the Wi&s;|dom
from above, de&s;cribed by St. <HI>Paul.</HI>
And if, in order to all this, that were done
in Places of Education, which cannot &s;o
well be done out of them: I &s;ay, if the&s;e
Steps were taken at home, while proper
Mea&s;ures are carrying on abroad, the one
would very much forward or facilitate
the other. As it is not meant, &s;o it mu&s;t
not be under&s;tood, that foreign Attempts
&s;hould wait for dome&s;tic Succe&s;s, but on|ly
that it is to be wi&s;hed they may co|operate.
Certainly if a ju&s;t and rational,
a genuine and &s;incere, a warm and vigo|rous
Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would &s;oon reach
our Foreign Plantations, and extend through|out
their Borders. We &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee
Religion &s;hine forth with new Lu&s;tre and
Force, to the Conver&s;ion of Infidels, both
at home and abroad, and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. x. 5.</NOTE><HI>the ca&s;ting

and every Thing
