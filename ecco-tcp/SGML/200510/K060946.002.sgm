<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Di&s;pute very learnedly handled by two
Ladies, in which the Reader may take
what Part he plea&s;es.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was too much
in Love to pa&s;s the Night with
any great Degree of Tranquillity,
under the Apprehen&s;ions he felt;
it being the Nature of that Pa&s;|&s;ion,
to magnify the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable
Trifles into Things of the greate&s;t Import|ance,
when they concern the beloved Ob|ject;
did not fail to torment him&s;elf with
a thou&s;and different Fears, which the my&s;teri|ous
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Behaviour of his Father, and the more
my&s;terious Words of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, gave Ri&s;e to.
Among many various Conjectures, all equally
unrea&s;onable, he fixed upon one, no way ad|vantageous
to Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> for, &s;uppo&s;ing that
the Folly of <HI>Arabella</HI> had really di&s;gu&s;ted him,
and made him de&s;irous of breaking off the de|&s;igned
Match between them; he was, as he
thought, taking Mea&s;ures to bring this about,
knowing, that if Lady <HI>Bella</HI> refu&s;ed to fulfil
her Father's De&s;ire in this Particular, a very
con&s;iderable E&s;tate would de&s;cend to him.</P>
<P>Upon any other Occa&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
would not have &s;u&s;pected his Father of &s;o un|generous
an Action; but Lovers think every
thing po&s;&s;ible, which they fear; and being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with this Opinion, he re&s;olved the
next Morning to &s;ound his Father's Inclina|tions,
by intreating him to endeavour to pre|vail
upon Lady <HI>Bella</HI> to marry him before her
Year of Mourning for the marquis was ex|pired.</P>
<P>Attending him, therefore, at Breakfa&s;t, in
his own Chamber, he made his de&s;igned Re|que&s;t,
not without heedfully ob&s;erving his
Countenance at the &s;ame time; and trembling,
le&s;t he &s;hould make him an An&s;wer, that
might confirm his unea&s;y Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed
him, by promi&s;ing to comply with his De&s;ire
that Day; for, added he, tho' my Niece has
&s;ome odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, &s;he is a
very accompli&s;hed Woman; and when you
are her Hu&s;band, you may probably find the
Means of curing her of tho&s;e little Follies,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
which at pre&s;ent are con&s;picuous enough; but
being occa&s;ioned by a Country Education, and
a perfect Ignorance of the World, the In|&s;truction,
which then you will not &s;cruple to
give her, and which, from a Hu&s;band, with|out
any Offence to her Delicacy, &s;he may
receive, may reform her Conduct; and make
her Behaviour as complete, as, it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, both her Per&s;on and Mind now
are.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> having acquie&s;ced in the Ju&s;|tice
of this Remark, as &s;oon as Breakfa&s;t was
over, went to vi&s;it the two Ladies, who ge|nerally
drank their Chocolate together.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> being then in Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s
Apartment, he was immediately admitted,
where he found them engaged in a high Di&s;|pute;
and, much again&s;t his Will, was obliged
to be Arbitrator in the Affair, they having, up|on
his Entrance, both appealed to him.</P>
<P>But, in order to place this momentous Af|fair
in a true Light, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to go back a
little, and acquaint the Reader with what had
pa&s;&s;ed in the Apartment; and al&s;o, following
the Cu&s;tom of the Romance and Novel-Wri|ters,
in the Heart, of our Heroine.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were her fair Eyes open in the
Morning, than the unfortunate Sir <HI>George</HI> pre|&s;enting
him&s;elf to her Imagination, her Thoughts
to u&s;e <HI>Scudery</HI>'s Phra&s;e, were at a cruel War with
each other: She wi&s;hed to prevent the Death
of this ob&s;equious Lover; but &s;he could not re|&s;olve
to pre&s;erve his Life, by giving him that
Hope he required; and without which, &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="6">
feared, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to
live.</P>
<P>After pondering a few Hours upon the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of his Ca&s;e, and what a ju&s;t Regard to
her own Honour required of her, Decorum
prevailed &s;o much over Compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he
re&s;olved to abandon the mi&s;erable Sir <HI>George</HI>
to all the Rigour of his De&s;tiny; when, hap|pily
for the di&s;con&s;olate Lover, the Hi&s;tory of
the fair <HI>Amalazotha</HI> coming into her Mind,
&s;he remembred, that this haughty Prince&s;s,
having refu&s;ed to marry the Per&s;on, her Fa|ther
recommended to her, becau&s;e he had not
a Crown upon his Head; neverthele&s;s, when he
was dying for Love of her, conde&s;cended to
vi&s;it him, and even to give him a little Hope,
in order to pre&s;erve his Life: See conceived it
could be no Blemi&s;h to her Character, if &s;he
followed the Example of this mo&s;t glorious
Prince&s;s; and &s;uffered her&s;elf to relax a little in
her Severity, to prevent the Effects of her Lo|ver's
De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Fear not, <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; fear
not to obey the Dictates of thy Compa&s;&s;ion,
&s;ince the glorious <HI>Amalazontha</HI> ju&s;tifies, by her
Example, the Means thou wilt u&s;e to pre&s;erve
a noble Life, which depends upon a few Words
thou &s;halt utter.</P>
<P>When &s;he had taken this Re&s;olution, &s;he
rung her Bell for her Women; and as &s;oon as
&s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them all but <HI>Lucy,</HI>
whom &s;he ordered to bring her Paper and Pens,
telling her, &s;he would write an An&s;wer to Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> obeyed with great Joy; but by that
<PB N="5" REF="7">
time &s;he had brought her Lady all the Mate|rials
for Writing, her Mind was changed; &s;he
having reflected, that <HI>Amalazontha,</HI> who&s;e Ex|ample,
in order to avoid the Cen&s;ure of future
Ages, &s;he was re&s;olved exactly to follow, did
not write to <HI>Ambiome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> but paid him a Vi&s;it,
&s;he re&s;olved to do the like; and therefore bid
<HI>Lucy</HI> take them away again, telling her: She
had thought better of it, and would not write
to him.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> extremely concerned at this Re&s;olution,
obeyed her very &s;lowly, and with greeat &s;eem|ing
Regret.</P>
<P>I perceive, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are afraid, I
&s;hall abandon the unfortunate Man you &s;o|licit&punc;
for, to the Violence of his De&s;pair; but
tho' I do not intend to write to him, yet I'll
make u&s;e of a Method, perhaps as effectual;
for, to &s;peak truly, I mean to make him a Vi&s;it;
for by this time his Fever is, I &s;uppo&s;e, vio|lent
enough to make him keep his Bed.</P>
<P>And will you be &s;o good, Madam, &s;aid
<HI>Lucy,</HI> to go and &s;ee the poor Gentleman? I
warrant you, he will be ready to die for Joy,
when he &s;ees you.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be proper Precautions u&s;ed, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to prevent tho&s;e Con&s;equences, which
the &s;udden and unexpected Sight of me may
produce. Tho&s;e about him, I &s;uppo&s;e, will have
Di&s;cretion enough for that: Therefore give Or|ders
for the Coach to be made ready, and tell
my Women, they mu&s;t attend me; and be
&s;ure you give them Directions, when I enter
Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Chamber, to &s;tay at a convenient
Di&s;tance, in order to leave me an Opportunity
<PB N="6" REF="8">
of &s;peaking to him, without being heard: As
for you, you may approach the Bed-&s;ide with
me; &s;ince, being my Confident, you may hear
all we have to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having thus &s;ettled the Ceremonial
of her Vi&s;it, according to the Rules pre&s;cribed
by Romances, &s;at down to her Tea-table,
having &s;ent to know, if Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was up,
and received for An&s;wer, that &s;he would at|tend
her at Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had at fir&s;t determined to
&s;ay nothing of this Affair to her Cou&s;in, could
not re&s;i&s;t the De&s;ire &s;he had of talking upon a
Subject &s;o intere&s;ting; and, telling her with a
Smile, that &s;he was about to make a very
charitable Vi&s;it that Morning, a&s;ked her, if
&s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to bear her Company in it.</P>
<P>I know you Country Ladies, &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> are very fond of vi&s;iting your &s;ick
Neighbours: For my Part, I do not love &s;uch
a grave kind of Amu&s;ement; yet, for the &s;ake
of the Airing, I &s;hall be very willing to attend
you.</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a more &s;erious
Air than before, it behoves every generous Per|&s;on
to compa&s;&s;ionate the Misfortunes of their
Acquaintance and Friends, and to relieve them
as far as lies in their Power; but tho&s;e Mi&s;eries
we our&s;elves occa&s;ion to others, demand, in a
more particular Manner, our Pity; and, if con|&s;i&s;tent
with Honour, our Relief.</P>
<P>And pray, returned Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who is
it you have done any Mi&s;chief to, which you
are to repair by this charitable Vi&s;it, as you
call it?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
The Mi&s;chief I have done, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
blu&s;hing, and ca&s;ting down her Eyes, was not
voluntary, I a&s;&s;ure you: Yet I will not &s;cruple
to repair it, if I can; tho', &s;ince my Power is
confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my En|deavours
may not haply have all the Succe&s;s I
could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Well, but, dear Cou&s;in, interrupted Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> tell me in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> what this
Mi&s;chief is, which you have done; and to what
Purpo&s;e you are going out this Morning?</P>
<P>I am going to pay a Vi&s;it to Sir <HI>George Bell|mour,</HI>
replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I intreat you, fair
Cou&s;in, to pardon me for robbing you of &s;o
accompli&s;hed a Lover. I really always thought
he was in Love with you, till I was undeceiv|ed
by &s;ome Words he &s;poke Ye&s;terday; and
a Letter I received from him la&s;t Night, in
which he has been bold enough to declare his
Pa&s;&s;ion to me, and, through the Apprehen&s;ion
of my Anger, is this Moment dying with
Grief; and 'tis to reconcile him to Life, that
I have prevailed upon my&s;elf to make him a
Vi&s;it; in which charitable De&s;ign, as I &s;aid
before, I &s;hould be glad of your Company.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who believed not a Word
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had &s;aid, bur&s;t out a laughing, at a
Speech, that appeared to her &s;o extremely fal&s;e
and ridiculous.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are of a Humour
to divert your&s;elf with the Mi&s;eries of a de|&s;pairing
Lover; and in this Particular, you
greatly re&s;emble the fair and witty <HI>Dorali&s;a,</HI>
who always je&s;ted at &s;uch Maladies as are oc|ca&s;ioned
by Love: However, this In&s;en&s;ibility
<PB N="8" REF="10">
does not become you &s;o well as her, &s;ince
all her Conduct was conformable to it, no Marr
in the World being bold enough to talk to her
of Love; but you, Cou&s;in, are ready, even by
your own Confe&s;&s;ion, to li&s;ten to &s;uch Di&s;|cour&s;es
from any body; and therefore this Be|haviour,
in you, may be with more Ju&s;tice
termed Levity, than Indifference.</P>
<P>I perceive, Cou&s;in, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
have always the wor&s;t of tho&s;e Compari&s;ons
you are plea&s;ed to make between me and other
People; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, as free and indi&s;|creet
as you think me, I &s;hould very much
&s;cruple to vi&s;it a Man, upon any Occa&s;ion
whatever.</P>
<P>I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> re|&s;umed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to hear you a&s;&s;ume a Cha|racter
of &s;o much Severity; you, who have
granted Favours of a Kind in a very great De|gree
criminal.</P>
<P>Favours! interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> crimi|nal
Favours! Pray explain your&s;elf, Madam.</P>
<P>Yes, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> I repeat it again;
criminal Favours, &s;uch as allowing Per&s;ons to
talk to you of Love; not forbidding them to
write to you; giving them Opportunities of
being alone with you for &s;everal Moments to|gether;
and &s;everal other Civilities of the like
Nature, which no Man can po&s;&s;ibly merit, un|der
many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains:
All the&s;e are criminal Favours, and highly blame|able
in a Lady, who has any Regard for her
Reputation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, replied Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> are no|thing
in Compari&s;on of making them Vi&s;its; and
<PB N="9" REF="11">
no Woman, who has any Reputation at all,
will be guilty of taking &s;uch Liberties.</P>
<P>What! Mi&s;s, replied, <HI>Arabella,</HI> will you
dare, by this In&s;inuation, to ca&s;t any Cen&s;ures
upon the Virtue of the divine <HI>Mandana,</HI> the
haughty <HI>Amalazontha,</HI> the fair <HI>Statira,</HI> the cold
and rigid <HI>Pari&s;atis,</HI> and many other illu&s;trious
Ladies, who did not &s;cruple to vi&s;it their Lo|vers,
when confined to their Beds, either by
the Wounds they received in Battle, or the
more cruel and dangerous ones they &s;uffered
from their Eyes? The&s;e cha&s;te Ladies, who ne|ver
granted a Ki&s;s of their Hand to a Lover,
till he was upon the Point of being their Hu&s;|band,
would neverthele&s;s mo&s;t charitably con|de&s;cend
to approach their Bed-&s;ide, and &s;peak
&s;ome compa&s;&s;ionate Words to them, in order
to promote their Cure, and make them &s;ubmit
to live; nay, the&s;e divine Beauties would not
refu&s;e to grant the &s;ame Favour to Per&s;ons
whom they did not love, to prevent the fatal
Con&s;equences of their De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Lord, Madam! interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I wonder you can talk &s;o bla&s;phemou&s;ly, to call
a Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and
&s;uch terrible Words.</P>
<P>Do you know, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a
&s;tern Look, that 'tis of the greate&s;t Prince&s;&s;es
that ever were, whom you &s;peak in this irre|verent
Manner? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that you can be
ignorant of the &s;ublime Quality of <HI>Mandana,</HI>
who was the Heire&s;s of Two powerful King|doms?
Are you not &s;en&s;ible, that <HI>Amalazontha</HI>
was Queen of <HI>Turringia?</HI> And will you pre|tend
<PB N="10" REF="12">
to deny the glorious Extraction of <HI>Statira</HI>
and <HI>Pari&s;atis,</HI> Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Per&s;ia?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf to deny any thing
about them, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> for
I never heard of them before; and really I do
not choo&s;e to be always talking of Queens and
Prince&s;&s;es, as if I thought none but &s;uch great
People were worthy my Notice: It looks &s;o
affected, I &s;huld imagine every one laughed
at me, that heard me.</P>
<P>Since you are &s;o very &s;crupulous, returned
<HI>Arabella,</HI> that you dare not imitate the Sublime&s;t
among Mortals, I can furni&s;h you with many
Examples, from the Conduct of Per&s;ons, who&s;e
Quality was not much &s;uperior to yours, which
may reconcile you to an Action, you at pre&s;ent,
with &s;o little Rea&s;on, condemn: And, to name
but One among &s;ome Thou&s;ands, the fair <HI>Cleo|nice,</HI>
the mo&s;t rigid and au&s;tere Beauty in all <HI>Sar|dis,</HI>
paid &s;everal Vi&s;its to the pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Ligda|mis,</HI>
when his Melancholy, at the ill Succe&s;s of
his Pa&s;&s;ion, threw him into a Fever, that con|fined
him to his Bed.</P>
<P>And pray, Madam, who was that <HI>Cleonice?</HI>
&s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> and where did &s;he live?</P>
<P>In <HI>Sardis,</HI> I tell you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> in the
Kingdom of <HI>Lydia.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! then it is not in our Kingdom, &s;aid
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI> What &s;ignifies what Foreigners
do? I &s;hall never form my Conduct, upon the
Example of Outlandi&s;h People; what is com|mon
enough in their Countries, would be very
particular here; and you can never per&s;uade me,
that it is &s;eemly for Ladies to pay Vi&s;its to
Men in their Beds.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
A Lady, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely angry at
her Cou&s;in's Ob&s;tinacy, who will &s;uffer Men
to pre&s;s her Hand, write to her, and talk to
her of Love, ought to be a&s;hamed of &s;uch an
affected Nicene&s;s, as that you pretend to.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t upon it, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
that all tho&s;e innocent Liberties you rail
at, may be taken by any Woman, without
giving the World room to cen&s;ure her: but,
without being very bold and impudent, &s;he
cannot go to &s;ee Men in their Beds; a Free|dom
that only becomes a Si&s;ter, or near Re|lation.</P>
<P>So then, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> reddening with
Vexation, you will per&s;i&s;t in affirming the di|vine
<HI>Mandana</HI> was impudent?</P>
<P>If &s;he paid &s;uch indi&s;creet Vi&s;its as tho&s;e, &s;he
was, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Oh Heavens! cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> have I lived
to hear the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Prince&s;s, that ever
was in the World, &s;o &s;hamefully reflected
on?</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Madam! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> what
Rea&s;on have you to defend the Character of
this Prince&s;s &s;o much? She will hardly thank
you for your Pains, I fan&s;y.</P>
<P>Were you acquainted with the Character of
that mo&s;t generous Prince&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you
would be convinced, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of
the &s;malle&s;t Benefits; but it is not with a View
of acquiring her Favour, that I defend her
again&s;t your inhuman A&s;per&s;ions, &s;ince it is
more than Two thou&s;and Years &s;ince &s;he died;
yet common Ju&s;tice obliges me to vindicate a
Per&s;on &s;o illu&s;trious for her Birth and Virtue;
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and were you not my Cou&s;in, I &s;hould expre&s;s
my Re&s;entment in another Manner, for the
Injury you do her.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I am not much
obliged to you Madam, for not downright
quarrelling with me for one that has been in
her Grave Two thou&s;and Years: However,
nothing &s;hall make me change my Opinion,
and I am &s;ure mo&s;t People will be of my Side
of the Argument.</P>
<P>That Moment Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;ending for
Permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;he ordered
him to be admitted, telling Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;he
would acquaint her Brother with the Di&s;pute:
To which &s;he con&s;ented.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which inculcates by a very good Example,
that a Per&s;on ought not to be too ha&s;ty in
deciding a Que&s;tion he does not perfectly
under&s;tand.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOU are come very opportunely, Sir, &s;aid.
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when he entered the Room, to
be Judge of a great Controver&s;y between Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville</HI> and my&s;elf. I be&s;eech you therefore,
let us have your Opinion upon the Matter.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> maintains, that it is le&s;s cri|minal
in a Lady to hear Per&s;ons talk to her of
Love, allow them to ki&s;s her Hand, and permit
them to write to her, than to make a charitable
Vi&s;it to a Man who is confined to his Bed
<PB N="13" REF="15">
through the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion and De|&s;pair;
the Intent of this Vi&s;it being only to pre|vent
the Death of an unfortunate Lover, and,
if nece&s;&s;ary, to lay her Commands upon him
to live.</P>
<P>And this latter is your Opinion, is it not
Madam? &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> and in this I
am ju&s;tified by all the Heroines of Antiquity.</P>
<P>Then you mu&s;t be in the Right, Madam, re|turned
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> both becau&s;e your own
Judgment tells you &s;o, and al&s;o the Example
of the&s;e Heroines you mention.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
ha&s;tily, &s;ince my Brother has given Sentence on
your Side, I hope you will not delay your Vi&s;it

<P>How! &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed, is Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> going to vi&s;it Sir <HI>George?</HI> Pray, Madam,
may I pre&s;ume to-inquire the Rea&s;on for your
doing him this extraordinary Favour?</P>
<P>You are not very wi&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> looking
gravely upon Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> to di&s;cover a
Thing, which may haply create a Quarrel be|tween
your Brother, and the unfortunate Per|&s;on
you &s;peak of: Yet &s;ince this Indi&s;cretion
cannot be recalled, we mu&s;t endeavour to pre|vent
the Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
extremely impatient to know the Mean|ing
of the&s;e Hints, you have nothing to fear
from me: Therefore you need not think your|&s;elf
under any Nece&s;&s;ity of concealing this Affair
from me.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
You are not, haply, &s;o moderate as you pre|tend,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> (who would not have been
di&s;plea&s;ed to have &s;een him in all the jealous
Tran&s;ports of an enraged <HI>Orontes);</HI> but what|ever
en&s;ues, I can no longer keep from your
Knowledge, a Truth your Si&s;ter has begun to
di&s;cover; but, in telling you what you de&s;ire to
know, I expect you will &s;uppre&s;s all Inclina|tions
to Revenge, and tru&s;t the Care of your In|tere&s;t
to my Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>You are to know then, that in the Per&s;on of
your Friend Sir <HI>George,</HI> you have a Rival,
haply the more to be feared, as his Pa&s;&s;ion is
no le&s;s re&s;pectful than violent: I po&s;&s;ibly tell
you more than I ought, pur&s;ued &s;he, blu&s;hing,
and ca&s;ting down her Eyes, when I confe&s;s,
that for certain Con&s;iderations, wherein perhaps
you are concerned, I have received the fir&s;t In|&s;inuation
of this Pa&s;&s;ion with Di&s;dain enough;
and I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that you are too generous
to de&s;ire any Revenge upon a mi&s;erable Rival,
of whom Death is going to free you.</P>
<P>Then, taking Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Letter out of her
Cabinet, &s;he pre&s;ented it to Mr. <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Read this, added &s;he; but read it without
&s;uffering your&s;elf to be tran&s;ported with any
violent Motions of Anger: And as in Fight, I
am per&s;uaded you would not oppre&s;s a fallen
and vanqui&s;hed Foe; &s;o in Love, I may hope,
an unfortunate Rival will merit your Com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Never doubt it, Madam, replied Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
receiving the Letter, which Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
with a beating Heart, earne&s;tly de&s;ired to hear
read. Her Brother, after a&s;king Permi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<HI>Arabella,</HI> prepared to gratify her Curio&s;ity; but
he no &s;ooner read the fir&s;t Sentence, than,
notwith&s;tanding all his Endeavours, a Smile ap|peared
in his Face; and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> le&s;s able,
and indeed le&s;s concerned to re&s;train her Mirth
at the uncommon Stile, bur&s;t out a laughing,
with &s;o much Violence, as obliged her Brother
to &s;top, and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Cough|ing,
in order to avoid giving <HI>Arabella</HI> the like
Offence.</P>
<P>The A&s;toni&s;hment of this Lady, at the &s;ur|pri&s;ing
and unexpected Effect her Lover's Let|ter
produced on Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> kept her in a
profound Silence, her Eyes wandering from the
Si&s;ter to the Brother; who, continuing his
Cough, was not able, for &s;ome Moments, to
go on with his Reading.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> during this Interval, having reco|vered
her&s;elf a little, a&s;ked Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
&s;he found any thing in a Lover's De&s;pair,
capable of diverting her &s;o much, as &s;he &s;eemed
to be with that of the unfortunate Sir <HI>George?</HI></P>
<P>My Si&s;ter, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
preventing her Reply, knows &s;o many of Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Infidelities, that &s;he cannot per&s;uade
her&s;elf he is really in &s;uch a dangerous Way
as he in&s;inuates: Therefore you ought not to be
&s;urpri&s;ed, if &s;he is rather di&s;po&s;ed to laugh at
this Epi&s;tle, than to be moved with any Con|cern
for the Writer, who, though he is my Ri|val,
I mu&s;t &s;ay, appears to be in a deplorable
Condition.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little compo|&s;ed
by tho&s;e Words, fini&s;h the Letter: Your
<PB N="16" REF="18">
Si&s;ter may po&s;&s;ibly find more Cau&s;e for Pity
than Contempt, in the latter Part of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> giving a Look to his Si&s;ter,
&s;ufficient to make her comprehend, that he
would have her re&s;train her Mirth for the future,
proceeded in his Reading; but every Line in|crea&s;ing
his &s;trong Inclination to laugh, when
he came to the pathetic Wi&s;h, that her fair
Eyes might &s;hed &s;ome Tears upon his Tomb,
no longer able to keep his a&s;&s;umed Gravity,
he threw down the Letter in a counterfeited
Rage.</P>
<P>Cur&s;e the &s;tupid Fellow! cried he, is he mad,
to call the fine&s;t Black Eyes in the Univer&s;e,
fair. Ah! Cou&s;in, &s;aid he to <HI>Arabella,</HI> to mu&s;t
be little acquainted with the Influence of your
Eyes, &s;ince he can &s;o egregiou&s;ly mi&s;take their
Colour.</P>
<P>And it is very plain, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
you are little acquainted with the &s;ublime Lan|guage
in which he writes, &s;ince you find Fault
with an Epithet, which marks the Beauty, not
the Colour, of tho&s;e Eyes he prai&s;es; for, in
fine, Fair is indifferently applied, as well to
Black and Brown Eyes, as to Light and Blue
ones, when they are either really lovely in
them&s;elves, or by the Lover's Imagination
created &s;o: And therefore, &s;ince Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has made him &s;ee Charms in my
Eyes, which que&s;tionle&s;s are not there; by
calling them fair, he has very happily expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf, &s;ince therein he has the Sanction of
tho&s;e great Hi&s;torians, who wrote the Hi&s;tories
of Lovers he &s;eems to imitate, as well in his
Actions as Stile.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
I find my Rival is very happy in your Opi|nion,
Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I am
apt to believe, I &s;hall have more Rea&s;on to

<P>If you keep within the Bounds I pre&s;cribe
you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you &s;hall have no Rea|&s;on
to envy his Situation; but, con&s;idering the
Condition to which his De&s;pair has by this Time
certainly reduced him, Humanity requires that
we &s;hould take &s;ome Care of him; and, to
&s;hew you how great my Opinion of your Ge|nero&s;ity
is, I will even intreat you to accom|pany
me in the Vi&s;it I am going to make him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being determined, if po&s;&s;ible,
to prevent her expo&s;ing her&s;elf, affected to be
extremely moved at this Reque&s;t; and, ri&s;ing
from his Chair in great &s;eeming Agitation, tra|ver&s;ed
the Room for &s;ome Moments, without

upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, that I will con&s;ent to
your vi&s;iting my Rival; and that I will be mean
enough to attend you my&s;elf to his Hou&s;e? Do
you think, that <HI>Orontes</HI> you have often re|proached
me with, would act in &s;uch a
Manner?</P>
<P>I don't know how <HI>Orontes</HI> would have acted
in this Ca&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> becau&s;e it never
happened that &s;uch a Proof of his Submi&s;&s;ion
was ever de&s;ired of him; but, con&s;idering that
he was of a very fiery and jealous Di&s;po&s;ition,
it is probable he might act as you do.</P>
<P>I always under&s;tood, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
that <HI>Orontes</HI> was a Favourite of yours,
but it &s;eems I was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
You will be very unju&s;t, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> to

and truly whoever reflects upon the
great Actions he did in the Wars between the
<HI>Amazons</HI> and the fierce <HI>Naobarzanes</HI> King of
the <HI>Cilicians,</HI> mu&s;t needs conceive a very high
Idea of his Virtue; but if I cannot bring the

when his Rival <HI>Oxyatres</HI> was &s;ick, intreat the

And the complai&s;ant Hu&s;band of the divine <HI>Pa|ri&s;atis</HI>
was not contented with barely de&s;iring
her to vi&s;it <HI>Ly&s;imachus,</HI> who was dying with
De&s;pair at her Marriage, but would many
times bring her him&s;elf to the Bed-&s;ide of this
unfortunate Lover, and, leaving her there, give
him an Opportunity of telling her what he
&s;uffered for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
&s;hall never be capable of imitating either the
brave <HI>Memnon,</HI> nor the complai&s;ant <HI>Ly&s;imachus,</HI>
in this Ca&s;e, and the Humour of <HI>Orontes</HI> &s;eems
to me the mo&s;t commendable.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> the Humour of
<HI>Orontes</HI> co&s;t him an infinite Number of Pains;
and it may happen, you will as near re&s;emble
him in his Fortune as you do in his Di&s;po&s;ition:
But pray let us end this Di&s;pute at pre&s;ent.
If you are not generous enough to vi&s;it an un|fortunate
Rival, you &s;hall not put a Stop to

I &s;hall be contented with the Attendance of

<P>Saying this, &s;he ro&s;e from her Seat, calling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> and ordered her to bid her Companions
attend.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;eeing her thus determined,
was almo&s;t mad with Vexation.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, &s;aid he, feizing
her Hand, you mu&s;t not go.</P>

<P>Nay, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> one of the&s;e

<P>In which our Heroine is in &s;ome little

<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> was uttering this pa|thetic
Complaint, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with
great Difficulty, kept him&s;elf from &s;miling;
and, by &s;ome &s;upplicating Looks to his Si&s;ter,
prevented her laughing out; yet &s;he gigled in
&s;ecret behind her Fan: But <HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;o lo&s;t
in her melancholy Reflections, that &s;he kept
her Eyes immoveably fixed on the Ground for
&s;ome Moments: At la&s;t, ca&s;ting an upbraiding
Glance at <HI>Glanville;</HI></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, cruel Per&s;on that you are !
&s;aid &s;he to him, that you can, without Pity,
&s;ee me &s;uffer &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s; and, knowing
the Sen&s;ibility of my Temper, can expo&s;e me
to the Grief of being acce&s;&s;ary to the Death of
an unfortunate Man, guilty indeed of a too
violent Pa&s;&s;ion, which merits a gentler Puni&s;h|ment,
than that you doom him to?</P>
<P>Don't be unea&s;y, dear Cou&s;in, interrupted
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> I dare a&s;&s;ure you Sir <HI>George</HI>
won't die.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to think that, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
&s;ince he has not &s;o much as received a Com|mand
from me to live; but tell me truly, pur|&s;ued
&s;he, do you believe it probable, that he will
obey me, and live?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
Indeed, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I could
&s;wear for him that he will.</P>
<P>Well, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I will content my&s;elf
with &s;ending him my Commands in Writing;
but it is to be feared they will not have &s;o much
Efficacy upon his Spirit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely plea&s;ed that &s;he
had laid a&s;ide her De&s;ign of vi&s;iting Sir <HI>George,</HI>
did not oppo&s;e her writing to him, though he
was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching
his Hands; and while &s;he went into her Clo&s;et
to write, he conferred with his Si&s;ter upon the
Means he &s;hould u&s;e, expre&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame
time, great Re&s;entment again&s;t Sir <HI>George,</HI>
for endeavouring to &s;upplant him in his Cou&s;in's
Affection.</P>
<P>What then, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> do you
really imagine Sir <HI>George</HI> is in Love with Lady
<HI>Bella?</HI></P>
<P>He is either in Love with her Per&s;on or
E&s;tate, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> or perhaps with
both; for &s;he is hand&s;ome enough to gain a
Lover of his Merit, though &s;he had no For|tune;
and &s;he has Fortune enough to do it,
though &s;he had no Beauty.</P>
<P>My Cou&s;in is well enough, to be &s;ure, &s;aid
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> but I never could think her a
Beauty.</P>
<P>If, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> a mo&s;t lovely
Complection, regular Features, a fine Stature,
an elegant Shape, and an inexpre&s;&s;ible Grace
in all her Motions, can form a Beauty, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> may pretend to that Character, without
any Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
Though &s;he was all that you &s;ay, returned
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I am certain Sir <HI>George</HI> is not

<P>I wi&s;h I was certain of that, replied Mr.

<P>You may &s;ee by his Letter, interrupted Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> what a Je&s;t he makes of her; and
if you had heard how he talked to her the other
Day in the Garden, you would have died with
Laughing; yet my poor Cou&s;in thought he was
very &s;erious, and was &s;o fooli&s;hly plea&s;ed!</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you <HI>Charlotte,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
gravely, I &s;hall take it very ill, if you make &s;o

Sir <HI>George</HI> pre&s;umes to make a Je&s;t of her, as
you &s;ay, I &s;hall teach him better Manners.</P>
<P>You are the &s;trange&s;t Creature in the World!
&s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI> A Minute or two ago, you
was wi&s;hing to be &s;ure he was not in Love with
her; and now you are angry, when I a&s;&s;ure
you he is only in Je&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> that Moment coming out of her
Clo&s;et, broke off their Di&s;cour&s;e. I have

<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> taking the Letter out of her

him&s;elf; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> willing his Si&s;ter &s;hould

I am too well convinced, &s;aid &s;he to Sir
<HI>George,</HI> that the Intent of your coming hither
To day, is to commit &s;ome Violence again&s;t
your&s;elf before my Eyes: But li&s;ten not, I be|&s;eech
you, to the Dictates of your De&s;pair:
Live; I command you, live; and &s;ince you &s;ay,
I have the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of your Life, do

<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who did not imagine <HI>Arabella</HI>
would communicate his Letter to her Cou&s;ins,
and only expected &s;ome di&s;tant Hints from her
concerning it, was &s;o confounded at this Re|ception
before them, that he was not able to
reply: He blu&s;hed, and turned pale alternately;
and, not daring to look, either upon Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
or her Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the
fair Vi&s;ionary, who, with great Impatience, ex|pected
his An&s;wer, he hung down his Head
in a very &s;illy Po&s;ture; and, by his Silence, con|firmed
<HI>Arabella</HI> in her Opinion.</P>
<P>As he did not want for Wit and A&s;&s;urance,
during that Interval of Silence, and Expecta|tion
from all Parties; his Imagination &s;ugge&s;ted
to him the Means of extricating him&s;elf out of
the ridiculous Perplexity he was in; and as it
concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel,
with the Brother and Si&s;ter, he determined to
turn the whole Matter into a Je&s;t; but, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to manage it &s;o, that <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;hould not
enter into his Meaning.</P>
<P>Rai&s;ing therefore his Eyes, and looking upon
<HI>Arabella</HI> with a melancholy Air;</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
You are not deceived, Madam, &s;aid he: This
Criminal, with whom you are &s;o ju&s;tly offend|ed,
comes with an Intention to die at your
Feet, and breathe out his mi&s;erable Life, to ex|piate
tho&s;e Crimes of which you accu&s;e him:
But &s;ince your &s;evere Compa&s;&s;ion will oblige
me to live, I obey, oh! mo&s;t divine, but cruel
<HI>Arabella!</HI> I obey your har&s;h Commands; and,
by endeavouring to live, give you a more con|vincing
Proof of that Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion
I &s;hall always have for your Will.</P>
<P>I expected no le&s;s from your Courage and
Genero&s;ity, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a Look of great
Complacency; and &s;ince you &s;o well know
how to imitate the great <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI> in your
Obedience, I &s;hall not be le&s;s acknowleging
then the fair <HI>Pari&s;atis;</HI> but will have for you
an E&s;teem equal to that Virtue I have ob|&s;erved

<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> having received this gracious Pro|mi&s;e,
with a mo&s;t profound Bow, turned to
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a kind of cha&s;tened Smile
upon his Countenance.</P>
<P>And, you, fortunate and de&s;erving Knight,
&s;aid he, happy in the Affections of the faire&s;t
Per&s;on in the World! grudge me not this &s;mall
Alleviation of my Misfortunes; and envy me
not that E&s;teem, which alone is able to make
me &s;uffer Life, while you po&s;&s;e&s;s, in the Heart
of the divine <HI>Arabella,</HI> a Felicity that might
be envied by the greate&s;t Monarchs in the
World.</P>
<P>As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
was extremely unea&s;y: For though Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Stratagem took, and he believed he
<PB N="28" REF="30">
was only indulging the Gaiety of his Humour,
by carrying on this Farce; yet he could not
endure, he &s;hould divert him&s;elf at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Expence. The &s;olemn Speech he had made him,
did indeed force him to &s;mile; but he &s;oon a&s;|&s;umed
a graver Look, and told Sir <HI>George,</HI> in
a low Voice, that when he had fini&s;hed his
Vi&s;it, he &s;hould be glad to take a Turn with
him in the Garden.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> promi&s;ed to follow him, and Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> left the Room, and went into the
Gardens; where the Baronet, having taken a
re&s;pectful Leave of <HI>Arabella,</HI> and, by a &s;ly
Glance, convinced Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> he had &s;a|crificed
her Cou&s;in to her Mirth, went to join
her Brother.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;aw him, walk|ed
to meet him with a very re&s;erved Air: Which
Sir <HI>George</HI> ob&s;erving, and being re&s;olved to keep
up his Humour;</P>
<P>What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, &s;aid
he, what, am I to under&s;tand by that Cloud
upon your Brow? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that thou
can&s;t envy me the &s;mall Comfort I have re|ceived;
and, not &s;atisfied with the glorious
Advantages thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t, wilt thou &s;till deny
me that E&s;teem, which the divine <HI>Arabella</HI>
has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me?</P>
<P>Pray, Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> lay
a&s;ide this pompous Style: I am not di&s;po&s;ed to
be merry at pre&s;ent, and have not all the Re|li&s;h
for this kind of Wit, that you &s;eem to ex|pect.
I de&s;ired to &s;ee you here, that I might
tell you without Witne&s;&s;es, I take it extreme|ly
ill, you &s;hould pre&s;ume to make my Cou&s;in
<PB N="29" REF="31">
the Object of your Mirth. Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> Sir,
is not a Per&s;on, with whom &s;uch Liberties
ought to be taken; nor will I, in the double
Character of her Lover and Relation, &s;uffer it
from any one whatever.</P>
<P>Cruel Fortune! &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;tepping back
a little, and lifting up his Eyes, &s;hall I al|ways
be expo&s;ed to thy Per&s;ecutions? And
mu&s;t I, without any apparent Cau&s;e, behold
an Enemy in the Per&s;on of my Friend; who,
though, without murmuring, I re&s;ign to him
the adorable <HI>Arabella,</HI> is yet re&s;olved to di&s;|pute
with me, a Satisfaction, which does not
deprive him of any Part of that glorious For|tune
to which he is de&s;tined? Since it is &s;o,
unju&s;t and cruel Friend, pur&s;ued he, &s;trike
this Brea&s;t, which carries the Image of the
divine <HI>Arabella;</HI> but think not, that I will offer
to defend my&s;elf, or lift my Sword, again&s;t a
Man beloved by her.</P>
<P>This is all very fine, returned Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
hardly able to forbear laughing; but 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible, with all your Gaiety, to hinder me
from being &s;erious upon this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Then be as &s;erious as thou wilt, dear <HI>Charles,</HI>
interrupted Sir <HI>George,</HI> provided you will allow
me to be gay; and not pretend to infect me
with thy unbecoming Gravity.</P>
<P>I have but a few Words to &s;ay to you, then,
Sir, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI> Either behave with
more Re&s;pect to my Cou&s;in; or prepare to
give me Satisfaction, for the In&s;ults you offer
her.</P>
<P>Oh! I under&s;tand you, Sir, &s;aid Sir <HI>George;</HI>
and becau&s;e you have taken it into your Head
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to be offended at a Trifle of no Con&s;equence in
the World, I mu&s;t give you a fair Chance to
run me through the Body! There is &s;omething
very fooli&s;h, &s;aith, in &s;uch an extravagant Ex|pectation:
But &s;ince Cu&s;tom has made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
that a Man mu&s;t venture his Soul and
Body upon the&s;e important Occa&s;ions; becau&s;e
I will not be out of the Fa&s;hion, you &s;hall com|mand
me whenever you think &s;it; though I
&s;hall fight with my Schoolfellow with a very
ill Will, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>There is no Nece&s;&s;ity for fighting, &s;aid Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> blu&s;hing at the ludicrous Light, in
which the gay Baronet had placed his Challenge:
The Conce&s;&s;ion I have required, is very &s;mall,
and not worth the conte&s;ting for, on your Side.
Lady <HI>Beila</HI>'s Peculiarity, to which you contri|bute
&s;o much, can afford you, at be&s;t, but an
ill-natured Diver&s;ion, while it gives me a real
Pain; and &s;ure, you mu&s;t acknowlege, you
are doing me a very great Injury, when you
endeavour to confirm a Lady, who is to be my
Wife, in a Behaivour that excites your Mirth,
and makes her a fit Object for your Ridicule,
and Contempt.</P>
<P>You do Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> a mnch greater Injury
than I do, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> by &s;uppo&s;ing,
&s;he can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Con|tempt:
I think very highly of her Under&s;tand|ing;
and though the Bent of her Studies has
given her Mind a romantic Turn, yet the
Singularity of her Manners is far le&s;s di&s;agree|able,
than the lighter Follies of mo&s;t of her
Sex.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">
But to be ab&s;olutely perfect, interrupted Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I mu&s;t cure her of that Singularity;
and therefore I beg you will not per&s;i&s;t in a&s;|&s;uming
a Behaviour conformable to her ro|mantic
Ideas; but rather help me to bani&s;h them
from her Imagination.</P>
<P>Well, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;ince you no longer
threaten, I'll do what I can to content you; but
I mu&s;t quit my Heroics by Degrees, and &s;ink
with Decency into my own Character; other|wi&s;e
&s;he will never endure me in her Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> appearing in
the Walk, broke off the Conver&s;ation. The
Baronet and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> walked forward to
meet them; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> who did not de&s;ire
Company, &s;truck into another Walk, whi|ther
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> following, propo&s;ed to join
her; when he &s;aw his Father, who had been
taking a Turn there alone, make up to <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and, &s;uppo&s;ing he would take that Op+portunity
to talk to her concerning him, he
went back to his Si&s;ter and Sir <HI>George,</HI> who&s;e

<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
advancing towards her, when, &s;en&s;ible of
the Con&s;equence of being alone with a Per|&s;on
whom &s;he did not doubt, would make u&s;e
of that Advantage, to talk to her of Love, &s;he
endeavoured to avoid him, but in vain; for Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> gue&s;&s;ing her Intentions, walked ha&s;tily
up to her; and, taking hold of her Hand,</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not go away, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid he:
I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely di&s;compo&s;ed at this Be|haviour,
&s;truggled to free her Hand from her
Uncle; and, giving him a Look, on which Di&s;|dain
and Fear were vi&s;ibly painted,</P>
<P>Unhand me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, and force me not
to forget the Re&s;pect I owe you, as my Uncle,
by treating you with a Severity &s;uch uncom|mon
In&s;olence demands.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> letting go her Hand in a great
Surprize, at the Word In&s;olent, which &s;he had
u&s;ed, a&s;ked her, If &s;he knew to whom &s;he was
&s;peaking?</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s, I am &s;peaking to my Uncle,
replied &s;he; and 'tis with great Regret I &s;ee
my&s;elf obliged to make u&s;e of Expre&s;&s;ions no
<PB N="33" REF="35">
way conformable to the Re&s;pect I bear that
&s;acred Character.</P>
<P>And, pray, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;ome|what
&s;oftened by this Speech, who is it that
obliges you to lay a&s;ide that Re&s;pect you &s;eem
to acknowlege is due to your Uncle?</P>
<P>You do, Sir, replied &s;he; and 'tis with in|finite
Sorrow, that I beheld you a&s;&s;uming a
Character unbecoming the Brother of my Fa|ther.</P>
<P>This is pretty plain, indeed, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles:</HI> But pray, Madam, inform me, what
it is you complain of.</P>
<P>You, que&s;tionle&s;s, know much better than I
can tell you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing, the
Offence I accu&s;e you of; nor is it proper for
me to mention, what it would not become me
to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Zounds! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no longer able
to &s;uppre&s;s his growing Anger, this is enough
to make a Man mad.</P>
<P>Ah! I be&s;eech you, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
&s;uffer not an unfortunate and ill-judged Pa&s;|&s;ion
to be the Bane of all your Happine&s;s and
Virtue: Recall your wandring Thoughts; re|flect
upon the Di&s;honour you will bring upon
your&s;elf, by per&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch unju&s;tifiable Sen|timents.</P>
<P>I do not know how it is po&s;&s;ible to avoid it,
&s;aid Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> and, notwith&s;tanding all this
fine Rea&s;oning, there are few People but would
fly into greater Extremities; but my Affection
for you makes me.&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, hold, I conjure you, Sir, interrupted
<HI>Arabella;</HI> force me not to li&s;ten to &s;uch injurious
<PB N="34" REF="36">
Language; carry that odious Affection &s;ome|where
el&s;e; and do not per&s;ecute an unfortu|nate
Maid, who has contributed nothing to thy
Fault, and is only guilty of too much Com|pa&s;&s;ion
for thy Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Good God, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;tarting back,
and looking upon <HI>Arabella</HI> with A&s;toni&s;hment;
how I pity my Son! What would I not give, if
he did not love this Girl?</P>
<P>Think not, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that the Pa&s;&s;ion
your Son has for me, makes your Condition a
bit the wor&s;e; for I would be &s;uch as I am,
with re&s;pect to you, were there no Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>

<P>I never thought, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> af|ter
a little Pau&s;e, that any Part of my Beha|viour,
could give you the Offence you com|plain
of, or authorize that Hatred and Con|tempt
you take the Liberty to expre&s;s for me:
But &s;ince it is &s;o, I promi&s;e you, I will quit
your Hou&s;e, and leave you to your &s;elf; I have
always been &s;olicitous for your Welfare; and,
ungrateful as you are&mdash;</P>
<P>Call me not ungrateful, interrupted <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
again: Heaven is my Witne&s;s, that had
you not forgot I was your Niece, I would have
always remembred you was my Uncle; and
not only have regarded you as &s;uch, but have
looked upon you as another Father, under
who&s;e Direction Providence had placed me,
&s;ince it had deprived me of my real Father; and
who&s;e Tenderne&s;s and Care, might have in
&s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplied the Lo&s;s I had of him:
But Heaven has decreed it otherwi&s;e; and &s;ince
it is his Will, that I &s;hould be deprived of the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
Comfort and A&s;&s;i&s;tance my Orphan State re|quires,
I mu&s;t &s;ubmit, without murmuring, to
my De&s;tiny. Go then, unfortunate and la|mented
Uncle, pur&s;ued &s;he, wiping &s;ome
Tears from her fine Eyes; go, and endeavour
by Rea&s;on and Ab&s;ence to recover thy Re|po&s;e;
and be a&s;&s;ured, whenever you can con|vince
me you have triumphed over the&s;e Sen|timents
which now cau&s;e both our Unhappine&s;s,
you &s;hall have no Cau&s;e to complain of my
Conduct towards you.</P>
<P>Fini&s;hing the&s;e Words, &s;he left him with &s;o
much Speed, that it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible
for him to have &s;topped her, though he
had intended it: But indeed, he was &s;o lo&s;t in
Wonder and Confu&s;ion at a Behaviour for
which he was not able to a&s;&s;ign any other
Cau&s;e than Madne&s;s, that he remained fixed
in the &s;ame Po&s;ture of Surprize, in which &s;he
had left him; and from which he was fir&s;t in|terrupted
by the Voice of his Son, who, &s;ee|ing
<HI>Arabella</HI> flying towards the Hou&s;e in great
&s;eeming Emotion, came to know the Re&s;ult of
their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had &s;poken to
his Father before, but had no An&s;wer, will
you not inform me, what Succe&s;s you have had
with my Cou&s;in? How did &s;he receive your
Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Speak of her no more, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;he
is a proud ungrateful Girl, and unworthy the
Affection you have for her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who trembled to hear &s;o un|favourable
an An&s;wer to his Inquiries, was
&s;truck dumb with his Surprize and Grief; when
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> taking Notice of the Alteration in
his Countenance;</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, &s;aid he, to find you have &s;et
your Heart upon this fanta&s;tic Girl: If ever
&s;he be your Wife, which I very much doubt,
&s;he will make you very unhappy: But, <HI>Charles,</HI>
pur&s;ued he, I would advi&s;e you to think no
more of her; content your&s;elf with the E&s;tate
you gain by her Refu&s;al of you: With that Ad|dition
to your own Fortune, you may pretend
to any Lady whatever; and you will find many
that are full as agreeable as your Cou&s;in, who
will be proud of your Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a Sigh,
there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would
choo&s;e to marry, but Lady <HI>Bella:</HI> I flattered
my&s;elf, I had been happy enough to have made
&s;ome Progre&s;s in her Affection; but it &s;eems, I
was mi&s;taken; however, I &s;hould be glad to
know, if &s;he gave you any Rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing
me.</P>
<P>Rea&s;ons! &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles:</HI> There is no mak|ing
her hear Rea&s;on, or expecting Rea&s;on from
her; I never knew &s;o &s;trange a Woman in my
Life: She would not allow me to &s;peak what
I intended concerning you; but interrupted me,
every Moment, with &s;ome high-flown Stuff or
other.</P>
<P>Then I have not lo&s;t all Hopes of her, cried
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> eagerly; for &s;ince &s;he did not
hear what you had to &s;ay, &s;he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
deny you.</P>
<P>But &s;he behaved in a very impertinent Man|ner
to me, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> complained
of my har&s;h Treatment of her; and &s;aid &s;eve|ral
<PB N="37" REF="39">
other Things, which, becau&s;e of her uncom|mon
Style, I could not perfectly under&s;tand;
yet they &s;eemed &s;hocking; and, upon the Whole,
treated me &s;o rudely, that I am determined to
leave her to her&s;elf, and trouble my Head no
more about her.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, dear Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
alarmed at this Re&s;olution, &s;u&s;pend your
Anger, till I have &s;een my Cou&s;in: There is
&s;ome Mi&s;take, I am per&s;uaded, in all this. I
know &s;he has &s;ome very odd Humours, which
you are not &s;o well acquainted with, as I am.
I'll go to her, and prevail upon her to explain
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>You may do &s;o, if you plea&s;e, replied Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> but I fear it will be to very little Pur|po&s;e;
for I really &s;u&s;pect her Head is a little
turned: I do not know what to do with her:
It is not fit &s;he &s;hould have the Management of
her&s;elf; and yet 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to live upon ea&s;y
Terms with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who did not doubt but <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
had been guilty of &s;ome very ridiculous
Folly, offered nothing more in her Ju&s;tifica|tion;
but, having attended his Father to his own
Chamber went to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment.</P>
<P>He found the pen&s;ive Fair-one, in a melan|choly
Po&s;ture, her Head reclined upon one
of her fair Hands; and though her Eyes were
fixed upon a Book &s;he held in the other, yet
&s;he did not &s;eem to read, but rather to be
wholly buried in Contemplation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> having &s;o happily found her
alone (for her Women were not then in her
Chamber) &s;eated him&s;elf near her; having fir&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="40">
a&s;ked Pardon for the Interruption he had given
to her Studies; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> throwing a&s;ide her
Book, prepared to li&s;ten to his Di&s;cour&s;e;
which by the Agitation, which appeared in
Looks, &s;he imagined, would be upon &s;ome
extraordinary Subject.</P>
<P>I left my Father ju&s;t now, &s;aid he, in a
great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s, on account of &s;ome|thing
you &s;aid to him, Lady <HI>Bella:</HI> He ap|prehends
you are di&s;obliged, and he would
willingly know how.</P>
<P>Has your Father then acquainted you with
the Subject of our Conver&s;ation? interrupted
<HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>I know what would have been the Subject of
your Conver&s;ation, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
you had been plea&s;ed to li&s;ten to what Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> intended to &s;ay to you on my Be|half.</P>
<P>On your Behalf? interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> Ah
poor deceived <HI>Glanville!</HI> how I pity thy blind
Sincerity! But it is not for me to undeceive
thee: Only thus much I mu&s;t &s;ay to you, Beware
of committing your Intere&s;ts to a Per&s;on, who
will be a much better Advocate for another
than for you.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> rejoiced to find by the&s;e
Words, that her Re&s;entment again&s;t his Fa|ther
was occa&s;ioned by a Su&s;picion &s;o favour|able
for him, a&s;&s;ured her, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
wi&s;hed for nothing more earne&s;tly, than that he
might be able to merit her E&s;teem; and that
it was to di&s;po&s;e her to li&s;ten to his Addre&s;&s;es,
that he wanted to di&s;cour&s;e with her that Morn|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being obliged, through his
Knowlege of his Cou&s;in's Temper, to &s;peak

Re&s;pect; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> who would not de|clare
her Rea&s;ons for doubting it, only replied,
That &s;he wi&s;hed Sir <HI>Charles</HI> meant all that he
had &s;aid to him; but that &s;he could not per|&s;uade
her&s;elf to believe him &s;incere, till his fu|ture
Actions had convinced her he was &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> impatient to let his Father
know, how greatly he had been mi&s;taken in
the Cau&s;e of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Behaviour, made his
Vi&s;it &s;horter than he would otherwi&s;e have done,
in order to undeceive him.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when his Son
had repeated the Conver&s;ation he had ju&s;t had
with <HI>Arabella,</HI> that &s;he could be &s;o fooli&s;h, as
to imagine, I had a De&s;ign to propo&s;e any one
el&s;e to her but you? What Rea&s;on have I ever
given her, to think I would not be glad to
have her for my Daughter-in-law? Indeed,
&s;he has &s;ome odd Ways that are very di&s;agree|able;
but &s;he is one of the be&s;t Matches in
<HI>England</HI> for all that: Poor Girl! pur&s;ued he,
&s;he had Rea&s;on to be angry, if that was the
Ca&s;e; and now I remember, &s;he cried, when
I told her I would leave the Hou&s;e; yet her
Spirit was &s;o great, that &s;he told me, I might
go. Well, I'll go and make it up with her;
but who could have imagined, &s;he would have
been &s;o fooli&s;h? Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> at the Repetition
of the&s;e Words, hurried away to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
Niece, &s;aid he at his Entrance, I am come
to a&s;k you Pardon, for having led you into a

<P>'Tis enough, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> I grant
you my Pardon for what is pa&s;t; and as it does not
become me to receive Submi&s;&s;ions from my

with your Acknowlegements at pre&s;ent:
Only to convince me, that this &s;udden Altera|tion

all Occa&s;ions of di&s;plea&s;ing me.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that I never in|tended&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not hear you &s;ay a Word more of your
pa&s;t Intentions, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> again: I
have forgot them all; and, while you con|tinue
to regard me as your Niece, I will ne|ver
remember them to your Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Then I may hope, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh! Heavens! cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> not &s;uffering
him to proceed; do you come to in&s;ult me
thus, with a mock Repentance? And has my
Ea&s;ine&s;s, in being &s;o ready to forget the In|jury
you would have done me, made you pre|&s;umptuous
enough to cheri&s;h an in&s;olent Hope
that I will ever change my Re&s;olution?</P>
<P>How vexatious is this! replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
fretting to &s;ee her continually mi&s;taking him.
I &s;wear to you, by all that is &s;acred, that 'tis
my Son, for whom I would &s;olicit your Con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>How! &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> a&s;toni&s;hed, Will you
then be ju&s;t at la&s;t? And can you re&s;olve to
plead for that Son, who&s;e Intere&s;t, but a Mo|ment
ago, you would have de&s;troyed?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
I &s;ee, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to
convince you.</P>
<P>No, no interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> ha&s;tily; it is
not impo&s;&s;ible but my own ardent Wi&s;hes that
it may be &s;o, will help to convince me of the
Truth of what you &s;ay: For in fine, do you
think, I &s;hall not be as glad as your&s;elf, to find
you capable of acting honourably by your Son;
and to &s;ee my&s;elf no longer the Cau&s;e of the
mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Conduct imaginable?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was opening his Mouth, to pre&s;s
her in Favour of Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI> whom, not|with&s;tanding
her &s;trange Behaviour, he was
glad to find, &s;he loved; when <HI>Arabella</HI> pre|venting
him,</P>
<P>Seek not, I be&s;eech you, &s;aid &s;he, to de|&s;troy
that Belief I am willing to give your
Words, by any more Attempts at this time
to per&s;uade me; for truly, I &s;hall interpret
your Solicitude no way in your Favour; there|fore,
if you de&s;ire I &s;hould be convinced you
are &s;incere, let the Silence I require of you, be
one Proof of it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who looked exce&s;&s;ively out of
Countenance at &s;uch a peremptory Command
from his Niece, was going out of her Cham|ber
in a very ill Humour, when the Dinner|bell
ringing, &s;he gave him her Hand, with a
very gracions Air; and permitted him to lead
her into the Dining-room, where they found
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> his Si&s;ter, and Sir <HI>George,</HI> who
had been detained to Dinner by Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing &s;ome Account of Thale&s;tris,
Queen of the Amazons, with other

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY <HI>Bella</HI> having recovered her u&s;ual
Chearfulne&s;s, thro' the Satisfaction &s;he
felt at her Uncle's returning to Rea&s;on, and
the Abatement &s;he perceived in Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Conver&s;a|tion
with that Wit and Vivacity which was
natural to her, and which &s;o ab&s;olutely charmed
the whole Company, that not one of them re|membred
any of her former Extravagancies.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gazed on her with a pa&s;&s;ionate
Tenderne&s;s, Sir <HI>George</HI> with Admiration, and
the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was inwardly vexed
at the Superiority her Cou&s;in's Wit gave her
over her&s;elf, wi&s;hed for nothing more than an
Opportunity of interrupting a Conver&s;ation in
which &s;he could have no Share; and, willing
to put them in mind of &s;ome of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
&s;trange Notions, when &s;he ob&s;erved them
di&s;puting concerning &s;ome of the Actions of
the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;he very innocently a&s;ked
Sir <HI>George,</HI> Whether in former times Women
went to the Wars, and fought like Men? For
my Cou&s;in, added &s;he, talks of one <HI>Thaltris,</HI> a
Woman, that was as courageous as any Soldier
whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> horridly vexed at a Que&s;tion
that was likely to engage <HI>Arabella</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e
very different from that &s;he had been &s;o capa|ble
of plea&s;ing in, frowned very intelligibly at
his Si&s;ter; and, to prevent any An&s;wer being
given to her ab&s;urd Demand, directed &s;ome
other Conver&s;ation to <HI>Arabella:</HI> But &s;he, who
&s;aw a favourite Subject &s;tarted, took no Notice
of what Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was &s;aying to her; but,
directing her Looks to Sir <HI>George,</HI></P>
<P>Though Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, be a little
mi&s;taken in the Name of that fair Queen &s;he
has mentioned; yet I am per&s;uaded you know
whom &s;he means; and that it is the renowned
<HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> who&s;e Valour &s;taggers her Belief,
and of whom &s;he wants to be informed.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI> It
is &s;uch a &s;trange Name I could not remember
it; but, pray, was there ever &s;uch a Per&s;on?</P>
<P>Certainly, Madam, there was, replied Sir
<HI>George:</HI> She was Queen of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> a war|like
Nation of Women, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great
Part of <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> and extended their Con|que&s;ts
&s;o far, that they became formidable to
all their Neighbours.</P>
<P>You find, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> I did not at|tempt
to impo&s;e upon you, when I told you
of the admirable Valour of that beautiful
Queen; which indeed was &s;o great, that the
united Princes, in who&s;e Cau&s;e &s;he fought,
looked upon her A&s;&s;i&s;tance to be equal to that
of a whole Army; and they honoured her,
accordingly, with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks
of their E&s;teem and Acknowlegement, and
offered her the chief Command of their Forces.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">
O &s;hameful! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> offer a
Woman the Command of an Army! Brave
Fellows indeed, that would be commanded by
a Woman! Sure your mi&s;take, Niece; there
never was &s;uch a thing heard of in the World.</P>
<P>What, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> will you contradict
a Fact atte&s;ted by the greate&s;t Hi&s;torians that
ever were? You may as well pretend to &s;ay,
there never were &s;uch Per&s;ons as <HI>Oroondates</HI> or
<HI>Juba,</HI> as di&s;pute the Exi&s;tence of the famous
<HI>Thale&s;tris.</HI></P>
<P>Why, pray, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
were tho&s;e?</P>
<P>One of them, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> was the
great King of <HI>Scythia;</HI> and the other, Prince
of the Two <HI>Mauritanias.</HI></P>
<P>Ods-heart! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I believe
their Kingdoms are in the Moon: I never heard
of <HI>Scythia,</HI> or the Two <HI>Mauritanias,</HI> before.</P>
<P>And yet, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho&s;e King|doms
are doubtle&s;s as well known, as <HI>France</HI>
or <HI>England;</HI> and there is no Que&s;tion, but the
De&s;cendants of the great <HI>Oroondates,</HI> and the
valiant <HI>Juba,</HI> &s;way the Sceptres of them to this
Day.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> I have a
very great Admiration for tho&s;e Two renowned
Princes, and have read their beautiful Exploits
with infinite Plea&s;ure; notwith&s;tanding which,
I am more inclined to e&s;teem the great <HI>Arta|ban,</HI>
then either of them.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Artaban,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is without
Que&s;tion, a Warrior equal to either of them,
and haply no Per&s;on in the World po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o
&s;ublime a Courage as his was; yet, it may be,

your Partiality proceeds from another Cau&s;e;

to favour him more than any other.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;hed when &s;he ended the&s;e
Words: And Sir <HI>George</HI> replied, with a Sigh;</P>
<P>I have, indeed, the Honour, Madam, to re|&s;emble
the great <HI>Artaban,</HI> in having dared to
rai&s;e my Thoughts towards a Divine Per&s;on,
who, with Rea&s;on, condemns my Adorations.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> are you going
to &s;peak of Divine Things, after all the Fables
you have been talking of? Troth, I love to
hear young Men enter upon &s;uch Subjects: But
pray, Niece, who told you Sir <HI>George</HI> was an
Infidel?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella:</HI> And I am
inclined to think he &s;poke Truth; for Sir
<HI>George</HI> has never pretended to deny it.</P>
<P>How! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> I am &s;orry
to hear that. I hope you have never, added
he, looking at the young Baronet, endea|voured
to corrupt my Son with any of your
Free-thinking Principles: I am for every
body having Liberty of Con&s;cience; but I
cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp
endeavouring to propagate your mi&s;chievous
Notions; and becau&s;e you have no Regard for
your own future Happine&s;s, di&s;turbing other
People in the laudable Pur&s;uit of theirs.</P>
<P>We will not ab&s;olutely condemn Sir <HI>George,</HI>
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> till we have heard his Hi&s;tory
from his own Mouth, which he promi&s;ed, &s;ome
time ago, to relate when I de&s;ired it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
I do not imagine his Hi&s;tory is fit to be heard
by Ladies, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> for your Infidels
live a &s;trange kind of Life.</P>
<P>However that may be, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> we
mu&s;t not di&s;pen&s;e with Sir <HI>George</HI> from per|forming
his Promi&s;e: I dare &s;ay there are no
Ladies here, who will think the wor&s;e of him
for freely confe&s;&s;ing his Faults.</P>
<P>You may an&s;wer for your&s;elf, if you plea&s;e,
Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> but I hope my Girl
there, will not &s;ay as much.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay my Cou&s;in is not &s;o rigid, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella:</HI> She has too much the Spirit of <HI>Ju|lia</HI>
in her, to find Fault with a little Infidelity.</P>
<P>I am always obliged to you for your Com|pari&s;ons,
Cou&s;in, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e
this is greatly to my Advantage too.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> has done you no Injury by the Compari|&s;on
&s;he has ju&s;t now made; for <HI>Julia</HI> was one
of the fine&s;t Prince&s;&s;es in the World.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he was not free from the Su&s;picion of
Infidelity, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> but though I do
not pretend to tax my Cou&s;in with that Fault,
yet it is with a great deal of Rea&s;on that I &s;ay
&s;he re&s;embles her in her volatile Humour.</P>
<P>I was never thought to be ill-humoured in
my Life, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> co|louring;
and I cannot imagine what Rea&s;on I
have given you for &s;aying I am.</P>
<P>Nay, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am not con|demning
your Humour; for, to &s;ay the Truth,
there are a great many Charms in a volatile
Di&s;po&s;ition; and, notwith&s;tanding the admirable
Beauty of <HI>Julia,</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible &s;he made as
<PB N="47" REF="49">
many Slaves by her light and airy Carriage, as
&s;he did by her Eyes, though they were the
faire&s;t in the World, except the divine <HI>Cleo|patra</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra!</HI> cried Sir <HI>Charles:</HI> Why &s;he was
a Gyp&s;ey, was &s;he not?</P>
<P>I never heard her called &s;o, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
gravely; and I am apt to believe you are not at
all acquainted with her: But pray, pur&s;ued &s;he,
let us wave this Di&s;cour&s;e at pre&s;ent, and pre|pare
to li&s;ten to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Relation of his
Life; which, I dare &s;ay, is full of very extra|ordinary
Events: However, Sir, added &s;he, di|recting
her Speech to the young Baronet, I am
afraid your Mode&s;ty will induce you to &s;peak
with le&s;s Candour than you ought, of tho&s;e
great Actions, which que&s;tionle&s;s you have per|formed:
Therefore we &s;hall hear your Hi&s;tory,
with greater Satisfaction, from the Mouth of
your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the
&s;ame Rea&s;ons that you have, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
what is mo&s;t admirable in the Adventures of
your Life.</P>
<P>Since it is your Plea&s;ure, Madam, replied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> to hear my Adventures, I will re|count
them as well as I am able my &s;elf, to
the end that I may have an Opportunity of
obliging you by doing &s;ome Violence to my na|tural
Mode&s;ty, which will not &s;uffer me to re|late
Things the World have been plea&s;ed to
&s;peak of to my Advantage, without &s;ome little
Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then, ca&s;ting down his Eyes, he &s;eemed to

the Diver&s;ion of hearing what Kind of Hi&s;tory
he would invent; and therefore re&s;olved to &s;tay

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was al&s;o highly delighted with
the Propo&s;al; but Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who could not
conceive there could be any thing worth

the Garden; when, perceiving it rained, he
changed his Re&s;olution, and, re&s;uming his Seat,

<P>_THOUGH at pre&s;ent, Madam,
you behold me in the Quality of a
private Gentleman, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
only of a tolerable E&s;tate;
yet my Birth is illu&s;trious enough:
My Ance&s;tors having formerly worn a Crown&punc;
which, as they won by their Valour, &s;o they lo&s;t
by their Misfortune only.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
How, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> are you de|&s;cended
from Kings? Why, I never heard you
&s;ay &s;o before: Pray, Sir, how far are you re|moved
from Royal Blood? and which of your
Forefathers was it that wore a Crown?</P>
<P>Sir, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> it is not much more
than Eight hundred Years &s;ince my Ance&s;tors,
who were <HI>Saxons,</HI> &s;wayed the Sceptre of <HI>Kent;</HI>
and from the fir&s;t Monarch of that mighty
Kingdom, am I lineally de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Pray where may that Kingdom of <HI>Kent</HI> lie?
&s;aid Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>In&mdash;replied Sir <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>A mighty Kingdom indeed! &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
Why, it makes but a very &s;mall Part of the King|dom
of <HI>Britain</HI> now: Well, if your An|ce&s;tors
were Kings of that County as it is now
called, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed their Dominions
were very &s;mall.</P>
<P>However that may be, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> it rai&s;es
Sir <HI>George</HI> greatly in my E&s;teem, to hear he is
de&s;cended from Kings; for, truly, a Royal Ex|traction
does infinitely &s;et off noble and valiant
Actions, and in&s;pires only lofty and generous
Sentiments: Therefore, illu&s;trious Prince (for
in that Light I &s;hall always con&s;ider you), be
a&s;&s;ured, though Fortune has de&s;poiled you of
your Dominions, yet &s;ince &s;he cannot deprive
you of your Courage and Virtue, Providence
will one Day a&s;&s;i&s;t your noble Endeavours to
recover your Rights, and place you upon the
Throne of your Ance&s;tors, from whence you
have been &s;o inhumanly driven: Or, haply, to
repair that Lo&s;s, your Valour may procure you
<PB N="51" REF="53">
other Kingdoms, no le&s;s con&s;iderable than that
to which you was born.</P>
<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
How come &s;uch improbable Things into your
Head? Is it &s;uch an ea&s;y Matter, think you, to
conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young
Man, who has neither Fleets nor Armies, with
&s;uch &s;trange Hopes?</P>
<P>The great <HI>Artaban,</HI> Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Ma&s;ter
only of a &s;ingle Sword; yet he &s;oon &s;aw him|&s;elf
greater than any King, di&s;po&s;ing the De|&s;tinies
of Monarchs by his Will, and deciding
the Fates of Empires by a &s;ingle Word: But
pray let this Di&s;pute re&s;t where it is, and per|mit
Sir <HI>George</HI> to continue his Relation.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary, Madam, re&s;umed Sir
<HI>George,</HI> to acquaint you with the Misfortunes
of my Family, or relate the &s;everal Progre&s;|&s;ions
it made towards the private Condition in
which it now is: For, be&s;ides that reciting the
Events of &s;o many Hundred Years may haply,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, try your Patience, I &s;hould
be glad if you would di&s;pen&s;e with me from
entering into a Detail of Accidents that would
&s;en&s;ibly afflict me: It &s;hall &s;uffice, therefore, to
inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable
Man, fond of Retirement and Tranquillity,
made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty
from which his Ance&s;tors had been unju&s;tly
expelled; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of
<HI>Kent</HI> in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of other Ma&s;ters, while
he contented him&s;elf with the Improvement of
that &s;mall Pittance of Ground, which was all
<PB N="52" REF="54">
that the unhappy Prince <HI>Veridomer,</HI> my Grand|father,
was able to bequeath to him.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Will you new|chri&s;ten
your Grandfather, when he has been
in his Grave the&s;e Forty Years? I knew ho|ne&s;t
Sir <HI>Edmard Bellmour</HI> very well, though I
was but a Youth when he died; but I be|lieve
no Per&s;on in <HI>Kent</HI> ever gave him the
Title of Prince <HI>Veridomer:</HI> Fie! fie! the&s;e are
idle Brags.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> without taking Notice of the old
Baronet's Heat, went on with his Narration in
this manner:</P>
<P>Things were in this State, Madam, when I
was born. I will not trouble you with the
Relation of what I did in my Infancy.</P>
<P>No, pray &s;kip over all that, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e your Infancy was like other
Peoples? What can there be worth hearing in
that?</P>
<P>You are deceived, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI> The
Infancy of illu&s;trious Per&s;onages has always
&s;omething very extraordinary in it; and from
their childi&s;h Words and Actions there have
been often Pre&s;ages drawn of their future
Greatne&s;s and Glory.</P>
<P>Not to di&s;oblige Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, &s;aid
the young Prince of <HI>Kent,</HI> I will not repeat
many things, which I &s;aid and did in the fir&s;t
Years of my Life, that tho&s;e about me thought
very &s;urpri&s;ing; and from them progno&s;ti|cated,
that very &s;trange Accidents would befal
me.</P>
<P>I have been a Witne&s;s of &s;ome very unfa|vourable
Progno&s;tics of you, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="55">
&s;miling; for you was the mo&s;t unlucky bold
Spark, that ever I knew in my Life.</P>
<P>'Tis very certain, pur&s;ued Sir <HI>George,</HI> that the
Forwardne&s;s of my Spirit gave great Unea&s;ine&s;s
to my Father; who, being, as I &s;aid before, in|clinable
to a peaceable and &s;edentary Life, en|deavoured
as much as po&s;&s;ible to repre&s;s that
Vivacity in my Di&s;po&s;ition, which he feared
might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes.
The Pains he took in my Education, I re|compen&s;ed
by a more than ordinary Docility:
and, before I was Thirteen, performed all my
Exerci&s;es with a marvelous Grace; and, if I
may dare &s;ay &s;o, was, at tho&s;e early Years, the
Admiration and Wonder of all that &s;aw me.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had &s;ome Rea&s;on to fear your
Mode&s;ty, I find, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;miling; for,
methinks you really &s;peak too &s;lightly of your
Excellencies.</P>
<P>However that may be, re&s;umed Sir <HI>George;</HI>
my Father &s;aw the&s;e early In&s;tances of a tower|ing
Genius in me, with a Plea&s;ure, cha&s;tened
by his Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage
would lead me to attempt &s;omething for the
Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my
Due; and which might haply occa&s;ion his lo&s;ing
me.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e Thoughts, he carefully
avoided &s;aying any thing to me concerning the
glorious Pretences, to which my Birth gave me
a Right; and often wi&s;hed it had been po&s;&s;ible
for him to conceal from me, that I was the
true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of <HI>Kent;</HI>
a Circum&s;tance he never cho&s;e to mention to
<PB N="54" REF="56">
any Per&s;on, and would have been glad, if it
had always remained a Secret.</P>
<P>And &s;o it was a Secret, interrupted Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> for, till this Day, I never heard of it;
and it might &s;till have been a Secret, if you had
plea&s;ed; for nobody, I dare &s;ay, would &s;u&s;pect
&s;uch a Thing; and very few, I believe, will
be inclined to think there is any thing in &s;uch
an improbable Tale.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my Father's Endeavours
to the contrary, Madam, pur&s;ued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
I cheri&s;hed tho&s;e towering Sentiments, the
Knowledge of my Birth in&s;pired me with; and
it was not without the utmo&s;t Impatience, that
I brooked the private Condition, to which I
found my&s;elf reduced.</P>
<P>Cruel Fate! would I &s;ometimes cry; was it
not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom,
which is my Due, and, &s;ubject me to a mean,
and inglorious State; but, to make that Condi|tion
infinitely more grievous, mu&s;t thou give
me a Soul, towering above my abject For|tune?
A Soul, that cannot but di&s;dain the ba&s;e
Submi&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t pay to tho&s;e, who triumph
in the Spoils of my ruined Hou&s;e? A Soul,
which &s;ees nothing above its Hopes and Ex|pectations?
And, in fine, a Soul, that excites
me daily to attempt Things worthy of my
Birth, and tho&s;e noble Sentiments I inherit
from my great Forefathers? Ah! pur&s;ued I,
unhappy <HI>Bellmour;</HI> what hinders thee from
making thy&s;elf known and acknowleged for
what thou art? What hinders thee from bold|ly
a&s;&s;erting thy ju&s;t and natural Rights; and
<PB N="55" REF="57">
from defying the U&s;urper, who detains them
from thee? What hinders thee, I &s;ay?</P>
<P>What? Interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> why the
Fear of a Halter, I &s;uppo&s;e: There is nothing
more ea&s;y than to an&s;wer that Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Such, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> were the
Thoughts, which continually di&s;turbed my
Imagination; and, doubtle&s;s, they had not fail|ed
to pu&s;h me on to &s;ome hazardous Enter|prize,
had not a fatal Pa&s;&s;ion interpo&s;ed; and
by its &s;weet, but dangerous Allurements,
&s;tifled for a while that Flame, which Ambi|tion,
and the Love of Glory, kindled in my
Soul.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> here pau&s;ing, and fixing his Eyes
with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as if
pre&s;t with a tender Remembrance;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> a&s;ked him, &s;imiling, If the
Thoughts of poor <HI>Dolly</HI> di&s;turbed him? Pray,
added he, give us the Hi&s;tory of your fir&s;t
Love, without any Mixture of Fable; or &s;hall
I take the Trouble off you? For you know, I
am very well acquainted with your Affair with
the pretty Milk-maid, and can tell it very &s;uc|cinctly.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Sir, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;ighing, I
cannot recall the Idea of <HI>Dorothea,</HI> into my
Remembrance, without &s;ome Pain: That fair,
but unfaithful Shepherde&s;s, who fir&s;t taught me
to &s;igh, and repaid my Tenderne&s;s with the
blacke&s;t Infidelity: Yet I will endeavour to
compo&s;e my&s;elf, and go on with my Narra|tion.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to know then, Madam, pur&s;ued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> that having my Thoughts, in this
<PB N="56" REF="58">
manner, wholly employed with the Di&s;a&s;ters
of my Family, I had arrived to my &s;eventeenth
Year, without being &s;en&s;ible of the Power of
Love; but the Moment now arrived, which
was to prove fatal to my Liberty. Following
the Chace one Day with my Father, and &s;ome
other Gentlemen, I happened to lag a little be|hind
them; and, being taken up with my ordi|nary
Reflections, I lo&s;t my Way, and wander|ed
a long time, without knowing or con&s;ider|ing
whither I was going. Chance at la&s;t con|ducted
me to a plea&s;ant Valley, &s;urrounded
with Trees; and, being tired with riding, I
lighted, and tying my Hor&s;e to a Tree, walked
forward, with an Intention to repo&s;e my&s;elf a
few Moments under the Shade of one of tho&s;e
Trees, that had attracted my Ob&s;ervation: But
while I was looking for the mo&s;t convenient
Place, I &s;pied, at the Di&s;tance of &s;ome few
Yards from me, a Woman lying a&s;leep upon
the Gra&s;s: Curio&s;ity tempted me to go nearer
this Per&s;on; and, advancing &s;oftly, that I
might not di&s;turb her, I got near enough to
have a View of her Per&s;on: But, ah! Hea|vens!
what Wonders did my Eyes encounter
in this View!&mdash;The Age of this fair Sleeper
&s;eemed not to exceed Sixteen; her Shape was
formed with the exacte&s;t Symmetry; one of her
Hands &s;upported her Head; the other, as it
lay carele&s;ly &s;tretched at her Side, gave me an
Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour
and Proportion: The thin Covering upon her
Neck di&s;covered Part of its inimitable Beauty
to my Eyes; but her Face, her lovely Face,
fixed all my Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
Certain it is, Madam, that, out of this Com|pany,
it would be hard to find any thing &s;o
perfect, as what I now viewed. Her Com|plexion
was the pure&s;t White imaginable,
heightened by the inchanting Glow, which
dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that
of a new-blown Ro&s;e: Her Lips, formed with
the greate&s;t Perfection, and of a deeper Red,
&s;eemed to receive new Beauties from the Fra|grance
of that Breath, that parted from them:
Her auburn Hair fell in loo&s;e Ringlets over her
Neck; and &s;ome &s;traggling Curls, that played
upon her fair Forehead, &s;et off by a charming
Contra&s;t the Whitne&s;s of that Skin it partly
hid: Her Eyes indeed were clo&s;ed; and though
I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty
were equal to tho&s;e other Miracles in her Face,
yet their Proportion &s;eemed to be large; and
the &s;nowy Lids, which covered them, were
admirably &s;et off by tho&s;e long and fable La&s;hes
that adorned them.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Moments I gazed upon this love|ly
Sleeper, wholly lo&s;t in Wonder and Admira|tion.</P>
<P>Where, whi&s;pered I, where has this Miracle
been concealed, that my Eyes were never ble&s;|&s;ed
with the Sight of her before? The&s;e Words,
though I uttered them &s;oftly, and with the
utmo&s;t Caution; yet by the murmuring Noi&s;e
they made, cau&s;ed an Emotion in the beauteous
Sleeper, that &s;he &s;tarted, and pre&s;ently after
opened her Eyes: But what Words &s;hall I find
to expre&s;s the Wonder, the A&s;toni&s;hment, and
Rapture, which the Sight of tho&s;e bright Stars
in&s;pired me with? The Flames which darted
<PB N="58" REF="60">
from tho&s;e glorious Orbs, ca&s;t &s;uch a dazling
Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a
Radiance &s;o unu&s;ual, that, &s;tepping back a few
Paces, I contemplated at a Di&s;tance, that
Brightne&s;s, which began already to kindle a
con&s;uming Fire in my Soul.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> con|founded
at &s;o pompous a De&s;cription; who
could this be?</P>
<P>The pretty Milk-maid, <HI>Dolly Acorn,</HI> replied
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gravely: Did you never &s;ee her,
Sir, when you was at your Seat, at&mdash;?
She u&s;ed often to bring Cream to my Lady.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I remember
her: She was a very pretty Girl: And &s;o it was
from her Eyes, that all tho&s;e Splendors and
Flames came, that had like to have burnt you
up, Sir <HI>George:</HI> Well, well, I gue&s;s how the
Story will end: Pray let us hear it out.</P>
<P>I have already told you, Madam, re&s;umed
Sir <HI>George,</HI> the marvelous Effects the Sight of
tho&s;e bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit: I
remained fixed in a Po&s;ture of A&s;toni&s;hment
and Delight; and all the Faculties of my Soul
were &s;o ab&s;orbed in the Contemplation of the
Miracles before me, that I believe, had &s;he
&s;till continued before my Eyes, I &s;hould never
have moved from the Place where I then &s;tood:
But the fair Virgin, who had &s;pied me at the
&s;mall Di&s;tance to which I was retired, turned
ha&s;tily about, and flew away with extraordi|nary
Swiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>When Love, now lending me Wings, whom
Admiration had before made motionle&s;s, I per|&s;ued
her &s;o eagerly, that at la&s;t I overtook her;
<PB N="59" REF="61">
and, throwing my&s;elf upon my Knees before
her,</P>
<P>Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you be
a Divinity, as your cele&s;tial Beauty makes me
believe, do not refu&s;e the Adoration I offer
you: But if, as I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h, you are
a Mortal, though &s;ure the faire&s;t that ever
graced the Earth; &s;top a Moment, to look up|on
a Man, who&s;e Re&s;pects for you as a Mor|tal
fall little &s;hort of tho&s;e Adorations he of|fers
you as a Godde&s;s.</P>
<P>I can't but think, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> laughing,
how poor <HI>Dolly</HI> mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a rho|domontade
Speech!</P>
<P>Oh, Sir! replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you will
find &s;he will make as good a one.</P>
<P>Will &s;he, by my Troth, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles.</HI> I
don't know how to believe it.</P>
<P>This Action, pur&s;ued Sir <HI>George,</HI> and the
Words I uttered, a little &s;urpri&s;ed that fair
Maid, and brought a Blu&s;h into her lovely
Cheeks; but, recovering her&s;elf, &s;he replied
with an admirable Grace,</P>
<P>I am no Divinity, &s;aid &s;he; and therefore
your Adorations are mi&s;placed: But if, as you
&s;ay, my Countenance moves you to any Re|&s;pect
for me, give me a Proof of it, by not
endeavouring to hold any further Di&s;cour&s;e
with me, which is not permitted me from one
of your Sex and Appearance.</P>
<P>A very wi&s;e An&s;wer, indeed! interrupted
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> again: Very few Town Ladies
would have di&s;claimed the Title of Godde&s;s, if
their Lovers had thought proper to be&s;tow it
<PB N="60" REF="62">
upon them. I am mightily plea&s;ed with the Girl
for her Ingenuity.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cretion of &s;o young a Dam&s;el, re|&s;umed
Sir <HI>George,</HI> charmed me no le&s;s than her
Beauty; and I be&s;ought her, with the utmo&s;t
Earne&s;tne&s;s, to permit me a longer Conver&s;a|tion
with her.</P>
<P>Fear not, lovely Virgin, &s;aid I, to li&s;ten to
the Vows of a Man, who, till he &s;aw you,
never learnt to &s;igh: My Heart, which de|fended
its Liberty again&s;t the Charms of many
admirable Ladies, yields, without Reluctance,
to the plea&s;ing Violence your Beauties lay
upon me. Yes, too charming and dangerous
Stranger, I am no longer my own Ma&s;ter: It
is in your Power to di&s;po&s;e of my De&s;tiny:
Con&s;ider therefore, I be&s;eech you, whether you
can con&s;ent to &s;ee me die? For I &s;wear to
you, by the mo&s;t &s;acred Oaths, unle&s;s you pro|mi&s;e
to have &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion on me, I will
no longer behold the Light of Day.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily conceive, Madam, that, con|&s;idering
this lovely Maid in the Character of
a Shepherde&s;s, in which &s;he appeared, I made
her a Declaration of my Pa&s;&s;ion, without think|ing
my&s;elf obliged to ob&s;erve tho&s;e Re&s;pects,
which, to a Per&s;on of equal Rank with my&s;elf,
Decorum would not have permitted me to for|get.</P>
<P>However, &s;he repelled my Boldne&s;s with
&s;o charming a Mode&s;ty, that I began to be|lieve,
&s;he might be a Per&s;on of illu&s;trious Birth,
di&s;gui&s;ed under the mean Habit &s;he wore: But,
having reque&s;ted her to inform me who &s;he was,
&s;he told me, her Name was <HI>Dorothea;</HI> and that
<PB N="61" REF="63">
&s;he was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in
the neighbouring Valley. This Knowlege in|crea&s;ing
my Confidence, I talked to her of my
Pa&s;&s;ion, without being the lea&s;t afraid of of|fending
her.</P>
<P>And therein you was greatly to blame, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella:</HI> For, truly, though the fair <HI>Dorothea</HI>
told you, &s;he was Daughter to a Farmer; yet,
in all Probability, &s;he was of a much higher
Extraction, if the Picture you have drawn of
her be true.</P>
<P>The fair <HI>Ar&s;inoe,</HI> Prince&s;s of <HI>Armenia,</HI> was
con&s;trained for a while to conceal her true
Name and Quality, and pa&s;s for a &s;imple
Country-woman, under the Name of <HI>Delia:</HI>
Yet the generous <HI>Philadelph,</HI> Prince of <HI>Cilicia,</HI>
who &s;aw and loved her under that Di&s;gui&s;e,
treated her with all the Re&s;pect he would have
done, had he known &s;he was the Daughter of a
King. In like manner, Prince <HI>Philoxipes,</HI> who
fell in Love with the beautiful <HI>Policrete,</HI> before
he knew &s;he was the Daughter of the great
<HI>Solon;</HI> and while he looked upon her as a poor
Stranger, born of mean Parents; neverthele&s;s,
his Love &s;upplying the Want of tho&s;e Advan|tages
of Birth and Fortune, he wooed her with
a Pa&s;&s;ion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if her
Extraction had been equal to his own. And
therefore tho&s;e admirable Qualities the fair
<HI>Dorothea</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, might al&s;o have convinced
you, &s;he was not what &s;he &s;eemed, but, haply,
&s;ome great Prince&s;s in Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>To tell you the Truth, Madam, replied Sir
<HI>George,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the fair <HI>Dorothea</HI> in|formed
me, &s;he was of a mean De&s;cent, I could
<PB N="62" REF="64">
not ea&s;ily forego the Opinion, that &s;he was of
an illu&s;trious Birth: And the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e
fair Prince&s;&s;es you have mentioned, coming in|to
my Mind, I al&s;o thought it very po&s;&s;ible,
that this divine Per&s;on might either be the
Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like
them; but, being wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the Vio|lence
of my new-born Affection, I li&s;tened to
nothing, but what mo&s;t flattered my Hopes;
and, addre&s;&s;ing my lovely Shepherde&s;s with all
the Freedom of a Per&s;on who thinks his Birth
much &s;uperior to hers; &s;he li&s;tened to my Pro|te&s;tations,
without any &s;eeming Reluctance,
and conde&s;cended to a&s;&s;ure me before we part|ed,
that &s;he did not hate me. So fair a Begin|ning,
&s;eemed to promi&s;e me the mo&s;t favour|able
Fortune I could with Rea&s;on expect. I
parted from my fair Shepherde&s;s with a thou&s;and
Vows of Fidelity; exacting a Promi&s;e from
her, that &s;he would meet me as often as &s;he
conveniently could, and have the Goodne&s;s to
li&s;ten to tho&s;e A&s;&s;urances of inviolable Tender|ne&s;s
my Pa&s;&s;ion prompted me to offer her.
When &s;he left me, it &s;eemed as if my Soul had
for&s;aken my Body to go after her: My Eyes
pur&s;ued her Steps as long as &s;he was in Sight; I
envied the Ground &s;he pre&s;t as &s;he went along,
and the Breezes that ki&s;&s;ed that cele&s;tial
Countenance in their Flight.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Hours I &s;tood in the &s;ame Po&s;ture
in which &s;he had left me; contemplating the
&s;udden Change I had experienced in my Heart,
and the Beauty of that divine Image, which
was now engraven in it. Night drawing on, I
began to think of going home; and, untying my
<PB N="63" REF="65">
Hor&s;e, I returned the Way I had come; and
at la&s;t &s;truck into a Road, which brought me
to the Place where I parted from the Company;
from whence I ea&s;ily found my Way home,
&s;o changed both in my Looks and Carriage,
that my Father, and all my Friends, ob&s;erved
the Alteration with &s;ome Surprize.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Sir George, continuing his &s;ur|pri&s;ing
Hi&s;tory, relates a mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous
In&s;tance of a Valour only to be pa|rallelled
by that of the great Oroondates,
Cae&s;areo, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR &s;ome Months, continued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
I pro&s;ecuted my Addre&s;&s;es to the admir|able
<HI>Dorothea;</HI> and I flattered my&s;elf with a
Hope, that I had made &s;ome Progre&s;s in her
Heart: But, alas! this deceitful Fair-one, who
only laughed at the Torments &s;he made me en|dure,
at the time &s;he vowed eternal Con&s;tancy
to me, gave her Hand to a Lover of her Fa|ther's
providing, and abandoned me, without
Remor&s;e, to the mo&s;t cruel De&s;pair.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you, Madam, with the
Repetition of tho&s;e Complaints, which this
perfidious Action drew from me for a long time.
At length, my Courage enabling me to over|come
the Violence of my Grief, I re&s;olved to
think of the ungrateful <HI>Dorothea</HI> no more; and
<PB N="64" REF="66">
the Sight of another Beauty completing my
Cure, I no longer remembred the unfaithful
Shepherde&s;s, but with Indifference.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, have I faithfully related one
of tho&s;e Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies
&s;lander me; who can &s;upport their A&s;&s;ertion,
with no better Proof, than that I did not die,
when <HI>Dorothea</HI> abandoned me: But I &s;ubmit
it to your Candour, whether an unfaithful
Mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;erved &s;uch an In&s;tance of Affec|tion,
from a Lover &s;he had betrayed?</P>
<P>Why, really, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> after a little
Pau&s;e, you had &s;ome Excu&s;e to plead for your
Failure in this Point: And though you cannot
be called, the mo&s;t perfect among&s;t Lovers,
&s;eeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of
dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked
among tho&s;e who are mo&s;t culpable: But pray
proceed in your Story: I &s;hall be better able to
form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lo|ver,
when I have heard all your Adventures.</P>
<P>My Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Dorothea,</HI> re&s;umed Sir <HI>George,</HI>
being cured by her Treachery towards me,
the Love of Glory began again to revive in my
Soul. I panted after &s;ome Occa&s;ion to &s;igna|lize
my Valour, which yet I had met with no
Opportunity of doing; but, hearing that a
mighty Army was preparing to march upon a
&s;ecret Expedition, I privately quitted my Fa|ther's
Seat; and, attended only by my faithful
'Squire, I took the &s;ame Route the Army had
taken, and arrived the Day before the terrible
Battle of&mdash;was fought, where, without
making my&s;elf known, I performed &s;uch Pro|digies
of Valour, as a&s;toni&s;hed all who beheld
<PB N="65" REF="67">
me. Without doubt, I &s;hould have been highly
care&s;&s;ed by the Commander, who certainly
would have given me the Honour of a Victory
my Sword alone had procured for him; but,
having unwittingly engaged my&s;elf too far in
Pur&s;uit of the flying Enemy, I found my&s;elf
alone, encompa&s;&s;ed with a Party of about Five
hundred Men; who, &s;eeing they were pur&s;ued
only by a &s;ingle Man, faced about, and pre|pared
to kill or take me Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when did
all this happen? And how came it to pa&s;s, that
your Friends have been ignorant to this Mo|ment
of tho&s;e Prodigies of Valour you per|formed
at that Battle? I never heard you was
ever in a Battle: Fame has done you great In|ju&s;tice,
by concealing the Part you had in that
famous Victory.</P>
<P>The great Care I took to conceal my&s;elf,
replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> was one Rea&s;on why my
Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits,
which the Knight in black Armour, who was
no other than my&s;elf, performed; and the Ac|cident
I am going to relate, prevented my be|ing
di&s;covered, while the Memory of tho&s;e
great Exploits were yet fre&s;h in the Minds of
tho&s;e I had &s;o greatly obliged.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to know, therefore, Madam, that,
&s;eeing my&s;elf about to be encompa&s;&s;ed by this
Party of the Enemy, I di&s;dained to fly; and,
though I was alone, re&s;olved to &s;u&s;tain their
Attack, and &s;ell my Life as dear as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Why, if you did &s;o, you was a Madman,
cried Sir <HI>Charles</HI> in a Heat: The brave&s;t Man
that ever lived, would not have pre&s;umed to
<PB N="66" REF="68">
fight with &s;o great a Number of Enemies. What
could you expect, but to be cut in Pieces?
Pooh! pooh! don't think any body will credit
&s;uch a ridiculous Tale: I never knew you was
&s;o addicted to&mdash;</P>
<P>Lying, perhaps, the good Knight would have
&s;aid; but Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was concerned he
was pre&s;ent at his Legend, and could not
blame him for doubting his Veracity, prevent|ed
his Utterance of a Word he would be oblig|ed
to take ill, by abruptly going on with his
Story.</P>
<P>Placing my Back therefore again&s;t a Tree,
pur&s;ued he, to prevent my being a&s;&s;aulted be|hind,
I pre&s;ented my Shield to the Bolde&s;t of
the&s;e A&s;&s;ailants; who, having &s;truck an impo|tent
Blow upon it, as he was lifting up his Arm
to renew his Attack, I cut it off with one
Stroke of my Sword; and the &s;ame In&s;tant
plunged it to the Hilt in the Brea&s;t of another,
and clove the Scull of a Third, who was mak|ing
at me, in two Parts.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> at this Relation, bur&s;t into a
loud Fit of Laughter; and, being more inclined
to divert him&s;elf, than be offended at the Folly
and Vanity of the young Baronet, he permitted
him to go on with his &s;urpri&s;ing Story, with|out
giving him any other Interruption.</P>
<P>The&s;e Three Executions, Madam, pur&s;ued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> were the Effects only of &s;o many
Blows; which rai&s;ed &s;uch Indignation in my
Enemies, that they pre&s;t forward in great Num|bers
to de&s;troy me; but, having, as I before
&s;aid, po&s;ted my&s;elf &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that I
could only be a&s;&s;aulted before, not more than
<PB N="67" REF="69">
Three or Four could attack me at one time. The
De&s;ire of lengthening out my Life, till happily
&s;ome Succour might come to my Relief, &s;o in|vigorated
my Arm, and added to my ordinary
Strength an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible Force, that I dealt
Death at every Blow; and in le&s;s than a quar|ter
of an Hour, &s;aw more than Fifty of my
Enemies at my Feet, who&s;e Bodies &s;erved for a
Bulwark again&s;t their Fellows Swords.</P>
<P>The Commander of this little Body, not
having Genero&s;ity enough to be moved with
tho&s;e prodigious Effects of my Valour in my
Favour, was tran&s;ported with Rage at my Re|&s;i&s;tance;
and the Sight of &s;o many of his Men
&s;lain before his Face, &s;erved only to increa&s;e
his Fury; and that Moment, &s;eeing, that, with
Two more Blows, I had &s;ent Two of his mo&s;t
valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the re&s;t
fearing to come within the Length of my
Sword, had given me a few Moments Re|&s;pite,</P>
<P>Ah! Cowards! cried he, are you afraid of
a &s;ingle Man? And will you &s;uffer <HI>him</HI> to
e&s;cape from your Vengeance, who has &s;lain &s;o
many of your brave Comrades before your
Eyes?</P>
<P>The&s;e Words in&s;piring them with a Fierce|ne&s;s,
&s;uch as he de&s;ired, they advanced towards
me with more Fury than before: By this time,
I had received &s;everal large Wounds, and my
Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body:
Yet was I not &s;en&s;ible of any Decay of Strength,
nor did the &s;ettled De&s;igns of my Enemies to
de&s;troy me daunt me in the lea&s;t: I &s;till relied
upon the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I expected Providence
<PB N="68" REF="70">
would &s;end to my Relief, and determined, if
po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve my Life, till it arrived.</P>
<P>I fought, therefore, with a Re&s;olution, which
a&s;toni&s;hed my Enemies, but did not move them
to any Regard for my Safety: And, ob&s;erving
their brutal Commander, a few Paces from me,
encouraging his Men, both with his Cries and
Ge&s;tures, Indignation again&s;t this inhuman
Wretch &s;o tran&s;ported me out of my Di&s;cre|tion,
that I quitted my Po&s;t, in order to &s;acri|fice
him to my Revenge.</P>
<P>Seeing me advance furiou&s;ly towards him, he
turned pale with Fear, and endeavoured to &s;hel|ter
him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of his Men; who, more
valiant than him&s;elf, oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to my
Rage, to favour his Retreat: But quickly clear|ing
my&s;elf a Way with my Sword, I pre&s;&s;ed to|wards
the barbarous Coward; and, ere he could
avoid the Blow I aimed at him, it &s;truck him
&s;en&s;ele&s;s at my Feet.</P>
<P>My particular Revenge thus &s;atisfied, I was
&s;en&s;ible of the Fault I had committed in quit|ting
my Po&s;t, by which I expo&s;ed my&s;elf to be
&s;urrounded by the Enemy. I endeavoured to
regain it, but in vain: I was be&s;et on all Sides,
and now de&s;paired of any Safety; and there|fore
only fought to die courageou&s;ly, and make
as many of my Enemies as I could, attend
my Fall.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated by the Misfortune of their Com|mander,
they pre&s;&s;ed upon me with redoubled
Fury. Faint as I was, with the Lo&s;s of Blood,
and &s;o fatigued with the pa&s;t Action, and the
ob&s;tinate Fight I had maintained &s;o long with
&s;uch a con&s;iderable Number, I could hardly any
<PB N="69" REF="71">
longer lift up my Arm; and, to complete, my
Misfortune, having thru&s;t my Sword into the
Body of one of the forwarde&s;t of my Enemies,
in my endeavouring to regain it, it broke in
Pieces, and the Hilt only remained in my Hand.</P>
<P>This Accident completed my Defeat: De|prived
of my Sword, I was no longer capable
of making any Defence: Several of them pre&s;&s;ed
upon me at once; and, throwing me down,
tied my Hands together behind me. Shame and
Rage at this Indignity worked &s;o forcibly up|on
my Spirts, weakened as I then was, that I
fell into a Swoon. What happened till my Re|covery,
I am not able to tell; but, at the Re|turn
of my Sen&s;es, I found my&s;elf laid on a
Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and &s;ome Per&s;ons
with me, who kept a profound Silence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Love-Adventure, after the Romantic
Ta&s;te.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>RECOLLECTING in a few Moments
all that happened to me, I could not
choo&s;e but be &s;urpri&s;ed at finding my&s;elf
treated with &s;o little Severity, con&s;idering I
was Pri&s;oner to Per&s;ons who had been Wit|ne&s;&s;es
of the great Quantity of Blood I had
&s;hed in my own Defence. My Wounds had
been dre&s;&s;ed while I continued in my Swoon;
and the Faces of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were about
me, expre&s;&s;ed nothing of Unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">
After reflecting &s;ome time longer on my
Situation, I called to a young Man, who &s;at
near my Bed-&s;ide, and intreated him to inform
me, Where I was, and to whom I was a Pri|&s;oner?
But could get no other An&s;wer to tho&s;e
Que&s;tions, than a mo&s;t civil Intreaty to com|po&s;e
my&s;elf, and not protract the Cure of my
Wounds by talking, which, the Surgeons had
declared, would be of a bad Con&s;equence;
and had therefore ordered me to be as little
di&s;turbed as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Remon&s;trance, I re|peated
my Reque&s;t, promi&s;ing to be entirely
governed by them for the future in what re|garded
my Health, provided they would &s;atisfy
me in tho&s;e Particulars: But my Attendant did
not &s;o much as reply to tho&s;e Importunities;
but, to prevent the Continuance of them, ro&s;e
from his Seat, and retired to the other End of
the Chamber.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed that Day, and &s;everal others, with|out
being able to learn the Truth of my Condi|tion:
All this time, I was diligently waited on
by the two Per&s;ons I had fir&s;t &s;een, neither
of whom I could prevail upon to inform me
of what I de&s;ired to know; and, judging, by
this ob&s;tinate Re&s;erve, and the Manner of my
Treatment, that there was &s;ome My&s;tery in
the Ca&s;e, I forbore to a&s;k them any more
Que&s;tions, conceiving they had particular Or|ders
not to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>The Care that was taken to forward my
Cure, in Three Weeks entirely re&s;tored me
to Health: I longed impatiently to know,
what was to be my De&s;tiny; and bu&s;ied my&s;elf
<PB N="71" REF="73">
in conjecturing it, in vain; when, one Morning,
an elderly Lady entered my Chamber, at who&s;e
Appearance my Two Attendants retired.</P>
<P>After &s;he had &s;aluted me very civilly, and
inquired after my Health, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf in
a Chair near my Bed&s;ide, and &s;poke to me in
this manner:</P>
<P>I make no que&s;tion, Sir, but you are &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at the Manner in which you have been
treated, and the Care there has been taken to
prevent di&s;covering to you the Place where
you now are; but you will doubtle&s;s be more
&s;urpri&s;ed, to hear you are in the Fortre&s;s of&mdash;,
and in the Hou&s;e of Prince <HI>Marcomire,</HI> who&s;e
Party you fought again&s;t alone; and whom
you &s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded, before you was
taken Pri&s;oner by his Men.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, Madam, &s;aid I, who, from
the fir&s;t Moment of her Appearance, had been
in a &s;trange Perplexity, is it po&s;&s;ible, I am in
the Hou&s;e of a Man, who&s;e Life I endeavoured
&s;o eagerly to de&s;troy? And is it to him, who
oppre&s;&s;ed me &s;o ba&s;ely with Numbers, that I
am obliged for the Succour I have received?</P>
<P>It is not to him, replied the Lady, that you
are obliged for the favourable Treatment you
have had; but li&s;ten to me patiently, and I
will di&s;clo&s;e the Truth of your Adventure.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Marcomire,</HI> who was the Per&s;on that
headed that Party again&s;t which you &s;o valiant|ly
defended your&s;elf, after the Lo&s;s of the
Battle, was ha&s;tening to throw him&s;elf into
this Place, where his Si&s;ter, and many Ladies
of Quality, had come for Security: Your in|di&s;creet
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Pur&s;uit engaged you in the mo&s;t un|equal
Combat that ever was fought; and&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> though I do
not refu&s;e to give you all the Prai&s;es your gal|lant
Defence of your&s;elf again&s;t Five hundred
Men de&s;erves; yet I cannot agree with that
Lady, in &s;aying, it was the mo&s;t unequal Com|bat
that ever was fought: For, do but reflect, I
be&s;eech you, upon that which the brave Prince
of <HI>Mauritania</HI> &s;u&s;tained again&s;t twice that Num|ber
of Men, with no other Arms than his
Sword; and, you having been in Battle that
Day, was, as I conceive, completely armed.
The young Prince of <HI>Egypt,</HI> accompanied only
by the valiant, but indi&s;creet, <HI>Cepio</HI> his Friend,
engaged all the King of <HI>Armenia</HI>'s Guards,
and put them all to Flight. The courageous
<HI>Arioba&s;anes</HI> &s;corned to turn his Back upon a
whole Army; not to mention the invincible
<HI>Artaban,</HI> whom a thou&s;and Armies together
could not have made to turn.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI>
that to the end I may faithfully recount my
Hi&s;tory, I am under a Nece&s;&s;ity of repeating
Things, which, haply, may &s;eem too advan|tageous
for a Man to &s;ay of him&s;elf: Therefore
I indeed greatly approve of the Cu&s;tom, which,
no doubt, this Inconveniency introduced, of a
'Squire, who is thoroughly in&s;tructed with the
Secrets of his Ma&s;ter's Heart, relating his Ad|ventures,
and giving a proper Eulogium of his
rare Valour, without being in Danger of of|fending
the Mode&s;ty of the renowned Knight;
who, as you know, Madam, upon tho&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions,
commodiou&s;ly &s;lips away.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">
It being, however, this Lady's Opinion, that
no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Com|bat,
or with greater Odds, again&s;t him, &s;he did
not fail to expre&s;s her Admiration of it, in very
high Terms.</P>
<P>The Noi&s;e of this Accident, pur&s;ued &s;he,
was &s;oon &s;pread over the whole Town; and
the beautiful <HI>Sydimiris, Marcomire</HI>'s Si&s;ter, hear|ing
that her Brother was wounded, as it was
thought to Death, and that the Per&s;on who
killed him, was taken Pri&s;oner; &s;he flew out
to meet her wounded Brother, di&s;tracted with
Grief, and vowing to have the &s;evere&s;t Tor|tures
executed on him, who had thus barba|rou&s;ly
murdered her Brother. Tho&s;e who bore
that unhappy Prince, having brought him into
the Hou&s;e, his Wounds were &s;earched; and
the Surgeons declared, they were very dan|gerous.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> hearing this, redoubled her Com|plaints
and Vows of Vengeance again&s;t you:
Her Brother having then the chief Authority in
the Place, &s;he commanded, in his Name, to
have you brought hither, and to be mo&s;t &s;trictly
guarded; determined, if her Brother died, to
&s;acrifice you to his Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;anguinary Re&s;olutions, &s;he
left his Chamber, having &s;een him laid in Bed;
and his Wounds dre&s;&s;ed; but pa&s;&s;ing along a
Gallery to her own Apartment, &s;he met the
Per&s;ons who were bringing you to the Room
that was to be your Pri&s;on: You was not, pur|&s;ued
the Lady, yet recovered from your Swoon,
&s;o that they carried you like one that was dead:
They had taken off your Helmet to give you
<PB N="74" REF="76">
Air; by which means your Face being quite
uncovered, pale, langui&s;hing, and your Eyes
clo&s;ed, as if in Death, pre&s;ented the mo&s;t
moving, and, at the &s;ame time, mo&s;t plea&s;ing
Object in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who &s;topt, and for a Moment
eagerly gazed upon you, lo&s;t all of a &s;udden
the Fiercene&s;s, which before had animated her
again&s;t you: And lifting up her Eyes to view
tho&s;e Men that carried you;</P>
<P>Are you &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he to them, that this is
the Per&s;on who wounded my Brother?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, replied one of them; this mu&s;t
be he, &s;ince there was no other in his Com|pany;
and he alone &s;u&s;tained the Attack of Five
hundred Men; and would probably not have
left one of them alive, had not his Sword, by
breaking, put it into our Power to take him
Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Carry him away, &s;aid <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> but let his
Wounds be dre&s;&s;ed, and let him be carefully
looked to, that, if my Brother dies, he may
be puni&s;hed as he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Pronouncing the&s;e Words in a low and fal|tering
Voice, &s;he turned her Eyes a &s;econd time
upon you; then, ha&s;tily averting her Looks,
&s;he hurried to her own Chamber, and threw
her&s;elf into a Chair, with all the Marks of a
very great Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The Affection I have for her, being the Per|&s;on
who had brought her up, and mo&s;t favoured
with her Confidence, made me behold her in
this Condition with great Concern; and &s;up|po&s;ing
it was her Brother that di&s;quieted her,
I be&s;ought her not to give way to the Violence
<PB N="75" REF="77">
of her Grief, but to hope that Heaven would
re&s;tore him to her Prayers.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear <HI>Urinoe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I am more
culpable than you can imagine; and I grieve le&s;s
for the Condition to which I &s;ee <HI>Marcomire</HI> re|duced,
than for that Moderation wherewith I
am con&s;trained, &s;pite of my&s;elf, to behold his
Enemy.</P>
<P>Yes, dear <HI>Urinoe,</HI> pur&s;ued &s;he, blu&s;hing,
and ca&s;ting down her Eyes, the Actions of
this Unknown appear to me in quite another
Light, &s;ince I have &s;een him; and, in&s;tead of
looking upon him as the Murderer of my Bro|ther,
I cannot help admiring that rare Valour,
with which he defended him&s;elf again&s;t &s;o great
a Number of Enemies; and am even ready to
condemn the furious <HI>Marcomire,</HI> for oppre&s;&s;ing
&s;o brave a Man.</P>
<P>As I had never approved of tho&s;e violent
Tran&s;ports of Grief and Rage, which &s;he had
expre&s;&s;ed upon the fir&s;t News of her Brother's
Misfortune; and as I looked upon your glo|rious
Defence with the utmo&s;t Admiration; &s;o,
far from condemning the Change of her
Thoughts, I confirmed her in the favourable
Opinion &s;he began to entertain of you; and,
continuing to make Remarks upon all the Par|ticulars
of the Combat, which had come to
our Knowlege, we found nothing in your Be|haviour,
but what increa&s;ed our Admiration.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> therefore, following the Dictates
of her own Genero&s;ity, as well as my Advice,
placed Two Per&s;ons about you, who&s;e Fide|lity
we could rely on; and gave them Orders
to treat you with all imaginable Care and Re|&s;pect,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
but not to inform you of the Place in
which you was, or to whom you was Pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Marcomire,</HI> who&s;e
Wounds had been again examined, was de|clared
out of Danger by the Surgeons; and he
having under&s;tood the Exce&s;s of his Si&s;ter's
Grief, and the Revenge &s;he had vowed again&s;t
you, gave her Thanks for tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of
her Tenderne&s;s; and al&s;o uttered &s;ome Threats,
which intimated a violent Hatred again&s;t you;
and a De&s;ign of pro&s;ecuting his Revenge upon
you, as &s;oon as he was in a Condition to leave
his Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who heard him, could with Dif|ficulty
di&s;&s;emble her Concern.</P>
<P>Ah! <HI>Urinoe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me, when we were
alone; 'tis now, that I more than ever repent
of that Exce&s;s of Rage, which tran&s;ported me
again&s;t the brave Unknown. I have thereby
put him intirely into my Brother's Power, and
&s;hall be haply acce&s;&s;ary to that Death he is
meditating for him, or el&s;e a perpetual Impri|&s;onment.</P>
<P>This Reflection gave her &s;o much Pain, that
I could not choo&s;e but pity her; and con&s;ider|ing,
that the only way to pre&s;erve you, was
for her to di&s;&s;emble a Rage equal to <HI>Mar|comire</HI>'s
again&s;t you, in order to prevent being
&s;u&s;pected of any De&s;ign in your Favour, I per|&s;uaded
her to join with him in every thing he
&s;aid; while, in the mean time, we would en|deavour
to get you cured of your Wounds, that
you might at lea&s;t be in a Condition once more
<PB N="77" REF="79">
to defend your&s;elf with that miraculous Valour
Heaven has be&s;towed on you.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> perceiving her Brother would &s;oon
be in a Condition to execute his Threats, re&s;olv|ed
to hazard every thing, rather than to expo&s;e
you to his Rage: She therefore communicated
to me her De&s;ign of giving you Liberty, and,
by pre&s;enting a &s;ufficient Reward to your
Guard, inducing them to favour your E&s;cape.</P>
<P>I undertook to manage this Bu&s;ine&s;s in her
Name, and have done it &s;o effectually, that
you will this Night be at Liberty, and may
depart the Town immediately, in which it will
be dangerous to &s;tay any time, for fear of
being di&s;covered.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> forbad me to let you know the
Per&s;on to whom you would be obliged for your
Freedom; but I could not endure, that you
&s;hould unju&s;tly involve the Si&s;ter of <HI>Marcomire,</HI>
in that Re&s;entment you will que&s;tionle&s;s always
pre&s;erve again&s;t <HI>him;</HI> and to keep you from being
innocently guilty of Ingratitude, I re&s;olved to
acquaint you with the Nature of tho&s;e Obliga|tions
you owe to her.</P>

<P>The Adventure continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AH! Madam, &s;aid I, perceiving &s;he had
fini&s;hed her Di&s;cour&s;e, doubt not but I
&s;hall mo&s;t gratefully pre&s;erve the Remembrance
of what the generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> has done for me;
<PB N="78" REF="80">
and &s;hall always be ready to lo&s;e that Life in
her Defence, which &s;he has had the &s;uperlative
Goodne&s;s to take &s;o much Care of. But, Ma|dam,
pur&s;ued I, with an earne&s;t Look, do not,
I be&s;eech you, refu&s;e me one Favour, without
which I &s;hall depart with inconceivable Sorrow.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied &s;he,
that if what you will require of me, be in my
Power, and fit for me to grant, I &s;hall very
willingly oblige you.</P>
<P>It is then, re&s;umed I, trembling at the Bold|ne&s;s
of my Reque&s;t, that you would conde|&s;cend
to intreat the mo&s;t generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to
favour me with an Interview, and give me an
Opportunity of throwing my&s;elf at her Feet,
to thank her for all tho&s;e Favours I have re|ceived
from her Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I cannot promi&s;e you, replied the Lady,
ri&s;ing, to prevail upon <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to grant you an
Audience; but I a&s;&s;ure you, that I will endea|vour
to di&s;po&s;e her to do you this Favour; and
it &s;hall not be my Fault, if you are not &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he went out of my Chamber,
I having followed her to the Door, with Pro|te&s;tations
that I would never forget her Kindne&s;s
upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I pa&s;t the re&s;t of that Day in an anxious Im|patience
for Night, divided between Fear and
Hope, and more taken up with the Thoughts
of &s;eeing <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> than with my expected
Liberty.</P>
<P>Night came at la&s;t, and the Door of my
Apartment opening, I &s;aw the Lady who had
been with me in the Morning, enter.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">
I have prevailed upon <HI>Sydimiris</HI> to &s;ee you,
&s;aid &s;he; and &s;he is willing, at my Intreaty, to
grant that Favour to a Per&s;on, who, &s;he with
Rea&s;on thinks, has been inhumanly treated by
her Brother.</P>
<P>Then, giving me her Hand, &s;he conducted
me along a large Gallery, to a &s;tately Apart|ment;
and after traver&s;ing &s;everal Rooms, &s;he
led me into one, where <HI>Sydimiris</HI> her&s;elf was:
Who, as &s;oon as &s;he perceived me, ro&s;e from
her Seat, and received me with great Civility.</P>
<P>In the Tran&s;port I then was, I know not
how I returned the grateful Salute the incom|parable
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> gave me; for mo&s;t certain
it is, that I was &s;o lo&s;t in Wonder, at the Sight
of the many Charms I beheld in her Per&s;on,
that I could not unlock my Tongue, or re|move
my Eyes from her inchanting Face; but
remained fixed in a Po&s;ture, which at once ex|pre&s;&s;ed
my Admiration and Delight.</P>
<P>To give you a De&s;cription of that Beauty
which I then contemplated, I mu&s;t inform
you, Madam, that <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is tall, of a hand|&s;ome
Stature, and admirably proportioned; her
Hair was of the fine&s;t Black in the World; her
Complexion marvelou&s;ly fair; and all the Li|neaments
of her Vi&s;age were perfectly beauti|ful;
and her Eyes, which were large and black,
&s;parkled with &s;o quick and piercing a Fire, that
no Heart was able to re&s;i&s;t their powerful
Glances: Moreover, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is admirably
&s;haped; her Port is high and noble; and her
Air &s;o free, yet &s;o commanding, that there are
few Per&s;ons in the World, with whom &s;he may

<PB N="80" REF="82">
Madam, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> appeared with &s;o many Ad|vantages,
to a Spirit prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed already with
the mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e of her Favours, that
I could not re&s;i&s;t the &s;weet Violence wherewith
her Charms took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Heart: I
yielded therefore, without Reluctance, to my
De&s;tiny, and re&s;igned my&s;elf, in an In&s;tant, to
tho&s;e Fetters, which the Sight of the Divine
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> prepared for me: Recovering there|fore
a little from that Admiration, which
had &s;o totally ingro&s;&s;ed all my Faculties, I
threw my&s;elf at her Feet, with an Action whol|ly
compo&s;ed of Tran&s;port.</P>
<P>Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> &s;aid I, beholding her with
Eyes, in which the Letters of my new-born
Pa&s;&s;ion might very plainly be read, &s;ee at
your Feet a Man devoted to your Service, by
all the Ties of Gratitude and Re&s;pect. I come,
Madam, to declare to you, that from the Fir&s;t
Moment you gave me Liberty, I had devoted
that and my Life to you; and at your Feet I
confirm the Gift; prote&s;ting by all that is mo&s;t
dear and &s;acred to me, that &s;ince I hold my
Life from the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> &s;he alone &s;hall
have the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of it for the future;
and &s;huld &s;he plea&s;e again to demand it, either
to appea&s;e her Brother's Fury, or to &s;acrifice
it to her own Security, I will mo&s;t faithfully
perform her Will, and &s;hed the la&s;t Drop of
that Blood at her Command, which I would
with Tran&s;port lo&s;e in her Defence.</P>
<P>A fine high-flown Speech indeed! &s;aid Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> laughing; but I hope you did not in|tend
to keep your Word.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
Sure, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you do not ima|gine,
that Sir <HI>George</HI> would have failed in
executing all he had promi&s;ed to the beautiful
and generous <HI>Sydimiris:</HI> What could he po&s;&s;i|bly
have &s;aid le&s;s? And indeed what le&s;s could
&s;he have expected from a Man, whom at the
Hazard of her own Life and Happine&s;s, &s;he had
given Freedom to?</P>
<P>I accompanied the&s;e Words, Madam, pur|&s;ued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> with &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate a Look and
Accent, that the fair <HI>Sydimiris</HI> blu&s;hed, and,
for a Moment, ca&s;t down her Eyes with a
vi&s;ible Confu&s;ion. At la&s;t,</P>
<P>Sir, replied &s;he, I am too well &s;atisfied with
what I have done, with re&s;pect to your Safety,
to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that
might be dangerous to it; and &s;hall remain ex|tremely
well &s;atisfied, if the Obligations you
think you owe me, may induce you to mode|rate
your Re&s;entment again&s;t my Brother, for
the cruel Treatment you received from him.</P>
<P>Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I, eagerly,
but I &s;hall, in the Per&s;on of <HI>Marcomire,</HI> regard
the Brother of the divine <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> and that
Con&s;ideration will be &s;ufficient, not only to
make me forget all the Violences he committed
again&s;t me, but even to de&s;end his Life, if need
be, with the Hazard of my own.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ively generous indeed! &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
I never heard any thing like it.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> there are
numberle&s;s In&s;tances of equal, and even &s;upe|rior
Genero&s;ity, to be met with in the L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ves of
the Heroes of Antiquity: You will there &s;ee
a Lover, who&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;s has been taken from
<PB N="82" REF="84">
him, either by Treachery or Force, venture
his Life in Defence of the injurious Hu&s;band
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her; and though all his Felicity
depends upon his Death, yet he will re&s;cue him
from it, at the Expence of the greater Part of
his Blood.</P>
<P>Another, who after a long and bloody War,
has, by taking his Enemy Pri&s;oner, an Oppor|tunity
of terminating it honourably; yet, thro'
an heroick Principle of Genero&s;ity, he gives
his Captive Liberty, without making any Con|ditions,
and has all his Work to do over again.</P>
<P>A Third, having contracted a violent Friend|&s;hip
with the Enemies of his Country, through
the &s;ame generous Sentiments, draws his Sword
in their Defence, and makes no Scruple to fight
again&s;t an Army, where the King his Father
is in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that Gene|ro&s;ity
&s;eems to me very peculiar, that will make
a Man fight for his Enemies again&s;t his own
Father.</P>
<P>It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that his Genero&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts; for certainly there
is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's
Father, and one's Country; but when a Man
has arrived to &s;uch a Pitch of Greatne&s;s of
Soul, as to neglect tho&s;e mean and &s;elfi&s;h Con|&s;iderations,
and, loving Virtue in the Per&s;ons
of his Enemies, can prefer their Glory before
his own particular Intere&s;t, he is then a perfect
Hero indeed: Such a one was <HI>Oroondates, Ar|taxcrxes,</HI>
and many others I could name, who
all gave eminent Proofs of their Di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s
and Greatne&s;s of Soul, upon the like Oc|ca&s;ions:
<PB N="83" REF="85">
Therefore not, to detract from Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Merit, I mu&s;t &s;till in&s;i&s;t, that in the
Re&s;olutions he had taken to defend his Ene|my's
Life at the Expence of his own, he did
no more, than what any Man of ordinary Ge|nero&s;ity
ought to do, and what he was particu|larly
obliged to, by what the amiable <HI>Sydimiris</HI>
had done for him.</P>
<P>I was &s;o happy, however, Madam, continued
Sir <HI>George,</HI> to find that tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of my
Gratitude wrought &s;omewhat upon the Heart
of the lovely <HI>Sydimiris</HI> in my Favour: Her
Words di&s;covered as much, and her Eyes &s;poke
yet more intelligibly; but our Conver&s;ation was
interrupted by the di&s;creet <HI>Urinoe,</HI> who, fearing
the Con&s;equence of &s;o long a Stay in her Cham|ber,
repre&s;ented to me, that it was time to
take my Leave.</P>
<P>I turned pale at this cruel Sound; and, be|holding
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> with a langui&s;hing Look,</P>
<P>Would to Heaven, Madam, &s;aid I, that
in&s;tead of giving me Liberty, you would keep
me eternally your Pri&s;oner; for though a Dun|geon
was to be the Place of my Confinement,
yet if it was near you, it would &s;eem a Palace
to me; for indeed I am no longer in a Condi|tion
to reli&s;h that Freedom you be&s;tow upon
me, &s;ince it mu&s;t remove me farther from you:
But I be&s;eech you, Madam, to believe, that in
delivering me from your Brother's Fetters, you
have ca&s;t me into your own, and that I am more
a Pri&s;oner than ever, but a Pri&s;oner to &s;o lovely
a Conqueror, that I do not wi&s;h to break my
Chains, and prefer the &s;weet and glorious Cap|tivity
<PB N="84" REF="86">
I am in, to all the Crowns in the
World.</P>
<P>You are very bold, &s;aid <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> blu&s;hing,
to entertain me with &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e; yet I
pardon this Offence, in Con&s;ideration of what
you have &s;uffered from my Brother, and on
Condition that you will depart immediately,
without &s;peaking another Word.</P>
<P><HI>Sydimiris</HI> &s;poke this &s;o earne&s;tly, that I dur&s;t
not di&s;obey her; and, ki&s;&s;ing the Hem of her
Robe, with a pa&s;&s;ionate Air, I left ber Cham|ber,
conducted by <HI>Urinoe;</HI> who having brought
me to a private Door, which carried us into
the Street, I there found a Man waiting for
me, whom I knew to be the &s;ame that had
attended me during my Stay in that Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> having recommended to him to &s;ee
me &s;afe out of the Town, I took Leave of
her, with the mo&s;t grateful Acknowlegements
for her Kindne&s;s; and followed my Conductor,
&s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with Grief at the Thoughts of
leaving the Place where <HI>Sydimiris</HI> was, that I
had hardly Strength to walk.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>An extraordinary In&s;tance of Genero&s;ity in
a Lover, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of the
great Artaxerxes, in Ca&s;&s;andra.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE farther I went, continued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
the more my Regret increa&s;ed; and,
finding it would be impo&s;&s;ible to live, and quit
<PB N="85" REF="87">
the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> I all at once took a Re|&s;olution
to remain in the Town concealed; and,
communicating my De&s;ign to my Guide, I en|gaged
him to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in it, by a Pre&s;ent of a
con&s;iderable Sum, which he could not re&s;i&s;t:
Accordingly he left me in a remote Part of the
Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodg|ing
for me; which he &s;oon procured, and al&s;o
a Suit of Cloaths to di&s;gui&s;e me, my own being
very rich and magnificent.</P>
<P>Having recommended me as a Relation of
his, who was newly arrived, I was received
very civilly by the People with whom he placed
me; and, finding this young Man to be very
witty and di&s;creet, and al&s;o very capable of
&s;erving me, I communicated to him my In|tentions
by &s;taying, which were only to be near
the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> and to have the Happine&s;s
of &s;ometimes &s;eeing her, when &s;he went
abroad.</P>
<P>This Man entering into my Meaning, a&s;&s;ured
me, he would faithfully keep my Secret; and
that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence
of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the Palace of <HI>Marcomire.</HI></P>
<P>I could with Difficulty keep my&s;elf from
falling at his Feet, to expre&s;s my Sen&s;e of his
kind and generous Offers; but I contented
my&s;elf with pre&s;enting him another Sum of
Money, larger than the fir&s;t, and a&s;&s;ured him
of my future Gratitude.</P>
<P>He then took Leave, and left me to my Re|flections,
which were wholly upon the Image
of the Divine <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> and the Happine&s;s of
being &s;o near the Object I adored.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">
My Confident came to me the next Day;
but brought me no other News, than that my
E&s;cape was not yet known to <HI>Marcomire.</HI> I
inquired if he had &s;een <HI>Sydimiris;</HI> but he re|plied
he had not, and that <HI>Urinoe</HI> had only
a&s;ked him, if he had conducted me &s;afe out of
Town: To which he had an&s;wered as we had
agreed, that I had got out &s;afe and undi&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>A Day or two after, he brought me News
more plea&s;ing; for he told me, that <HI>Sydimiris</HI>
had &s;ent for him into her Chamber, and a&s;ked
him &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning me: That
&s;he appeared very melancholy, and even blu&s;h|ed,
whenever &s;he mentioned my Name.</P>
<P>This Account gave &s;ufficient Matter for my
Thoughts to work upon for &s;everal Days. I
interpreted <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s Blu&s;h a Thou&s;and differ|ent
Ways; I reflected upon all the different
Cau&s;es to which it might be owing, and bu&s;ied
my&s;elf with all tho&s;e innumerable Conjectures,
which, as you know, Madam, &s;uch an Incident
always gives Ri&s;e to in a Lover's Imagination.
At length I explained it to my own Advantage,
and felt thereby a con&s;iderable Increa&s;e of my
Affection.</P>
<P>A whole Week having elap&s;ed, without
another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be
greatly alarmed; when, on the Eighth Day of
this cruel Su&s;pen&s;e, I &s;aw him appear; but with
&s;o many Marks of Di&s;turbance in his Face,
that I trembled to hear what he had to acquaint
me with.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, &s;aid he, as &s;oon as his Concern
&s;uffered him to &s;peak, <HI>Marcomire</HI> has di&s;covered
<PB N="87" REF="89">
your E&s;cape, and the Means by which it was pro|cured:
One of tho&s;e in whom <HI>Urinoe</HI> confided,
has betrayed it to him; and the beauteous <HI>Sy|dimiris</HI>
is likely to feel the mo&s;t terrible Effects
of his Di&s;plea&s;ure: He has confined her to her
Chamber, and vows to &s;acrifice her Life to the
Honour of his Family; which he &s;ays, &s;he
has &s;tained; and he loads that admirable Lady
with &s;o many Reproaches, that it is thought,
her Grief for &s;uch unde&s;erved Calumnies will
occa&s;ion her Death.</P>
<P>Scarce had he fini&s;hed the&s;e cruel Words,
when I, who all the time he had been &s;peaking,
beheld him with a dying Eye, &s;unk down at
his Feet in a Swoon; which continued &s;o long,
that he began to think me quite dead: How|ever
I at la&s;t opened my Eyes; but it was only
to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter
Complaints, which might have moved the mo&s;t
obdurate Heart.</P>
<P>After having a long time tormented my&s;elf
in weeping and complaining, I at la&s;t took a
Re&s;olution, which afforded me &s;ome Alleviation
of my Grief; and the faithful <HI>Toxares,</HI> &s;eeing
me a little compo&s;ed, left me to my&s;elf, with
a Promi&s;e to return &s;oon, and acquaint me with
what pa&s;&s;ed further in the Palace of <HI>Marcomire.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, I ro&s;e from my Bed;
and, dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf in tho&s;e Cloaths I wore
when I was taken Pri&s;oner, I went to the Pa|lace
of <HI>Marcomire;</HI> and, demanding to &s;ee him,
I was told he was in the Apartment of <HI>Sydimi|ris;</HI>
and, at my earne&s;t De&s;ire, they conducted
me thither.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">
When I entered the Room, I beheld that
incomparable Beauty &s;tretched upon a Couch,
di&s;&s;olved in Tears; and <HI>Urinoe</HI> upon her Knees,
before her, accompanying with her own, tho&s;e
precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes
of her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Marcomire,</HI> who was walking furiou&s;ly about
the Room, exclaiming with the utmo&s;t Vio|lence
again&s;t that fair Sufferer, did not ob&s;erve
my Entrance; &s;o that I had an Opportunity of
going towards <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who, lifting up her
Eyes to look upon me, gave a loud Shriek;
and, by a Look of extreme Angui&s;h, let me
under&s;tand, how great her Apprehen&s;ions were
upon my Account.</P>
<P>I am come, Madam, &s;aid I, to perform
Part of the Promi&s;e I made you, and by dying,
to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from
the Reproaches you &s;uffer on my Account, I
&s;hall have the Happine&s;s to convince you, that
my Life is infinitely le&s;s dear to me, than your
Tranquillity. <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who hearkened to
me with great Emotion, was going to make
&s;ome An&s;wer, when <HI>Marcomire,</HI> alarmed by
his Si&s;ter's Shriek, came towards us, and, view|ing
me at fir&s;t with A&s;toni&s;hment, and then
with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge,</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, that I behold my de|&s;igned
Murderer again in my Power?</P>
<P>I am in thy Power, &s;aid I, becau&s;e I am
willing to be &s;o; and came voluntarily to put
my&s;elf into your Hands, to free that excellent
Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her:
Know, <HI>Marcomire,</HI> that it is to my&s;elf alone
I owed my Liberty, which I would &s;till pre|&s;erve
<PB N="89" REF="91">
again&s;t all the Forces thou could&s;t bring to
deprive me of it; and this Sword, which left
thee Life enough to threaten mine, would haply
once more put yours in Danger, were I not re|&s;trained
by a powerful Con&s;ideration, which
leaves me not the Liberty of even wi&s;hing you
ill.</P>
<P>Ah! Di&s;&s;embler, &s;aid <HI>Marcomire,</HI> in a Rage,
think not to impo&s;e upon me by thy counter|feited
Mildne&s;s: Thou art my Pri&s;oner once
more, and I &s;hall take care to prevent your
e&s;caping a Second time.</P>
<P>I am not your Pri&s;oner, replied I, while I
po&s;&s;e&s;s this Sword, which has already defended
me again&s;t greater Numbers than you have here
to oppo&s;e me; but, continued I, throwing down
my Sword at <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s Feet, I re&s;ign my Li|berty
to re&s;tore that Lady to your good Opi|nion,
and to free her from tho&s;e ba&s;e A&s;per&s;ions
thou ha&s;t unju&s;tly loaded her with, upon my
Account.</P>
<P>It matters not, &s;aid the brutal Brother, taking
up my Sword, whether thou ha&s;t re&s;igned, or
I have deprived thee of Liberty; but &s;ince thou
art in my Power, thou &s;hall feel all the Effects
of my Re&s;entment: Take him away, pur&s;ued
he to &s;ome of his People; put him into the wor&s;t
Dungeon you can find; and let him be guarded
carefully, upon Pain of Death, if he again
e&s;capes.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Words, &s;everal Men offered to
lead me out of the Room; but I repul&s;ed them
with Di&s;dain; and, making a low Reverence to
<HI>Sydimiris,</HI> who&s;e Countenance expre&s;&s;ed the

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter, Madam, pur&s;ued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
being wholly calculated to make me hope
that I was not hated by the Divine <HI>Sydimiris;</HI>
and that &s;he meditated &s;omething in my Favour;
I re&s;igned my&s;elf up to the mo&s;t delightful Ex|pectations.</P>
<P>What! cried I, tran&s;ported with the Ex|ce&s;s
of my Joy: Does the mo&s;t admirable <HI>Sy|dimiris</HI>
conde&s;cend to a&s;&s;ure me, that I have
touched her Heart? And does &s;he promi&s;e

<P>Ah! too happy, and too fortunate <HI>Bellmour,</HI> to
what a glorious De&s;tiny ha&s;t thou been re|&s;erved!
And how oughte&s;t thou to adore the&s;e
Fetters, that have procured thee the E&s;teem
of the Divine <HI>Sydimiris!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Such, Madam, were the Apprehen&s;ions,
which the Billet I had received in&s;pired me
with. I continually flattered my&s;elf with the
mo&s;t plea&s;ing Hopes; and during Three Weeks
longer, in which I heard no more from <HI>Sydi|miris,</HI>
my Imagination, was wholly filled with
tho&s;e &s;weet Thoughts, which her Letter had
made me entertain.</P>
<P>At length, on the Evening of a Day which
I had wholly &s;pent in reading over <HI>Sydimiris</HI>'s
Letter; and interpreting the Sen&s;e of it a thou|&s;and
different Ways, but all agreeable to my
ardent Wi&s;hes; I &s;aw the &s;age <HI>Urinoe</HI> enter my
<PB N="92" REF="94">
Pri&s;on, accompanied by <HI>Toxares,</HI> whom I had
not &s;een during my la&s;t Confinement. Wholly
tran&s;ported at the Sight of the&s;e Two Friends,
and not doubting but they had brought me the
mo&s;t agreeable News, I ran towards them; and,
throwing my &s;elf at <HI>Urinoe</HI>'s Feet, I begged her,
in an Ec&s;tacy of Joy, to acquaint me with <HI>Sy|dimiris</HI>'s
Commands.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe,</HI> in &s;ome Confu&s;ion at this Action,
intreated me to ri&s;e. 'Tis fit, cried I, in a
Tran&s;port I could not ma&s;ter, that in this
Po&s;ture I &s;hould receive the Knowlege of that
Felicity <HI>Sydimiris</HI> has had the Goodne&s;s to
promi&s;e me. <HI>Urinoe</HI> &s;ighed at the&s;e Words;
and, beholding me with a Look of Compa&s;&s;ion
and Tenderne&s;s,</P>
<P>Would to God, &s;aid &s;he, that all I have to
&s;ay, were as agreeable, as the fir&s;t News I have
to tell you; which is, that you are free, and at
Liberty to leave the Town this Moment! <HI>Sy|dimiris,</HI>
continued &s;he, has bought your Free|dom,
at the Expence of her own; and, to de|liver
you from her Brother's Chains, &s;he has
put on others, haply more cruel than tho&s;e
you have worn: In fine, &s;he has married a Man,
whom &s;he dete&s;ted, to procure your Liberty;
her Brother having granted it to her upon that
Condition alone.</P>
<P>Scarce had <HI>Urinoe</HI> fini&s;hed the&s;e Words, when
I fell, without Sen&s;e or Motion, at her Feet.
<HI>Toxares</HI> and &s;he, who had fore&s;een what might
happen, having provided them&s;elves with Cor|dials
nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore me, brought me to

<P><PB N="93" REF="95">
Cruel! &s;aid I to them, with a Tone and

dying, at once to prevent the thou&s;and Deaths
I &s;hall &s;uffer from my Grief? Is this the Con|firmation
of tho&s;e glorious Hopes <HI>Sydimiris</HI> had

is it by throwing her&s;elf into the Arms of my
Rival, that &s;he repays tho&s;e Obligations &s;he
thinks &s;he owes me?</P>
<P>Ah! inhuman <HI>Sydimiris!</HI> was it to make
my De&s;pair more poignant, that thou flattere&s;t
me with &s;uch a Pro&s;pect of Happine&s;s? And
was it nece&s;&s;ary, to the Grandeur of thy Nup|tials,
that my Life &s;hould be the Sacrifice?</P>
<P>But, how unju&s;t am I, cried I, repenting in
an In&s;tant of tho&s;e injurious Su&s;picions; How
unju&s;t am I, to accu&s;e the Divine <HI>Sydimiris</HI> of
Inhumanity? Was it not to give me Freedom,
that &s;he be&s;towed her&s;elf upon a Man &s;he
hates? And has &s;he not made her&s;elf mi&s;erable
for ever, to procure me a fan&s;ied Happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Ah! if it be &s;o, what a Wretch am I? I,
who have been the only Cau&s;e of that Mi&s;ery,
to which &s;he has doomed her&s;elf? Ah! Liberty!
pur&s;ued I, how I dete&s;t thee, &s;ince purcha&s;ed
by the Misfortune of <HI>Sydimiris!</HI> And how far
more &s;weet and glorious were tho&s;e Chains,
which I wore for her &s;ake!</P>
<P>My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer
the Power of Speech, I &s;unk down on my Bed,
oppre&s;s'd with a mortal Grief.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares</HI> drew near to comfort me,
<PB N="94" REF="96">
and &s;aid all that &s;en&s;ible and di&s;creet Per&s;ons
could think of to alleviate my De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Though I have heard that <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is mar|ried,
replied I, without dying immediately;
yet do not imagine, that I will &s;uffer this odious
Life to continue long. If Sorrow do not quickly
di&s;patch me, I will &s;eek Death by other Means;
for &s;ince <HI>Sydimiris</HI> is lo&s;t, I have no more Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
in the World.</P>
<P>The charitable <HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares</HI> endea|voured
in vain to divert me from this &s;ad Re|&s;olution,
when <HI>Urinoe,</HI> finding all their Rea&s;on|ings
ineffectual, drew a Letter out of her Pocket,
and, pre&s;enting it to me, I had Orders, &s;aid
&s;he, not to let this Letter be delivered to you,
till you had left the Town; but the De&s;pair,
to which I &s;ee you reduced, does, I conceive,
di&s;pen&s;e with my rigorous Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e

</LETTER>
<P>Ah! <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> cried I, having read this
Letter, more cruel in your Kindne&s;s than Se|verity!
After having deprived me of your&s;elf,
do you forbid me to die; and expo&s;e me by &s;o
rigorous a Command to Ills infinitely more
hard and painful than Death?</P>
<P>Yes, pur&s;ued I, after a little Pau&s;e; yes, <HI>Sy|dimiris,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="98">
thou &s;halt be obeyed; we will not dye,
&s;ince thou ha&s;t commanded us to live; and,
notwith&s;tanding the Tortures to which thou
condemne&s;t us, we will obey this Command;
and give thee a glorious Proof of our pre&s;ent
Submi&s;&s;ion, by enduring that Life, which the
Lo&s;s of thee has rendered truly wretched.</P>
<P><HI>Urinoe</HI> and <HI>Toxares,</HI> &s;omewhat rea&s;&s;ured, by
the Re&s;olution I had taken, exhorted me by all
the Per&s;ua&s;ions, Friend&s;hip could put in their
Mouths, to per&s;evere in it; and, <HI>Urinoe</HI> bid|ding
me Farewel, I endeavoured to prevail upon
her to procure me a Sight of <HI>Sydimiris</HI> once
more, or at lea&s;t to bear a Letter from me to
her; but &s;he refu&s;ed both the&s;e Reque&s;ts &s;o
ob&s;tinately, telling me, <HI>Sydimiris</HI> would neither
con&s;ent to the one nor the other, that I was oblig|ed
to be contented with the Promi&s;e &s;he made
me, to repre&s;ent my Affliction in a true Light
to her Mi&s;tre&s;s; and to a&s;&s;ure her, that nothing
but her ab&s;olute Commands could have hin|dered
me from dying. Then, taking leave of
me with much Tenderne&s;s, &s;he went out of
tbe Pri&s;on, leaving <HI>Toxares</HI> with me, who a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
me to dre&s;s, and conducted me out of
that mi&s;erable Place, where I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many
&s;ad, and al&s;o joyful Hours. At a Gate to which
he brought me, I found a Hor&s;e waiting; and,
having embraced this faithful Confidant, with
many Expre&s;&s;ions of Gratitude, I be&s;towed a
Ring of &s;ome Value upon him to remember me
by; and, mounting my Hor&s;e, with a breaking
Heart, I took the fir&s;t Road which pre&s;ented
it&s;elf to my Eyes, and galloped away, without
knowing whither I went. I rode the whole
<PB N="97" REF="99">
Night, &s;o totally engro&s;&s;ed by my De&s;pair, that
I did not perceive my Hor&s;e was &s;o tired, it
could hardly carry me a Step farther: At la&s;t
the poor Bea&s;t fell down under me, &s;o that I
was obliged to di&s;mount; and, looking about
me, perceived I was in a Fore&s;t, without &s;ee|ing
the lea&s;t Appearance of any Habitation.</P>
<P>The Wilderne&s;s, and Solitude of the Place,
flattered my De&s;pair, and while my Hor&s;e was
feeding upon what Gra&s;s he could find, I wan|dered
about: The Morning ju&s;t breaking, gave
me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance
at la&s;t conducted me to a Cave, which &s;eemed
to have been the Re&s;idence of &s;ome Hermit, or
unfortunate Lover like my&s;elf. It was dug at
the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to it thick
&s;et with Bu&s;hes, which hid it from View. I
de&s;cended by a few Steps cut rudely enough,
and was convinced, it had formerly &s;erved for
a Habitation for &s;ome religious or melan|choly
Per&s;on; for there were Seats of Turf
rai&s;ed on each Side of it, a kind of Bed com|po&s;ed
of dried Leaves and Ru&s;hes, and a Hole
made artificially at the Top, to admit the Light.</P>
<P>While I con&s;idered this Place attentively,
I all at once took up a Re&s;olution, in&s;pired by
my De&s;pair; which was, to continue there,
and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement
&s;o fitted for my Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Giving my Hor&s;e therefore Liberty to go
where he plea&s;ed, and hanging up my Arms
upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this &s;olitary Man&s;ion, with a gloomy Kind
of Satisfaction, and devoted all my Hours to
the Contemplation of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">
I lived in this manner, Madam, for Ten
Months, without feeling the lea&s;t De&s;ire to
change my Habitation; and, during all that
time, no Mortal approached my Solitude, &s;o

<P>A &s;ingle Combat fought with prodigious
Valour, and de&s;cribed with amazing
Accuracy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>GIVE me Leave, Sir, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> to
a&s;k, If you eat in all this Time?</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> Sighs and Tears
were all my Su&s;tenance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and Mi&s;s, laugh|ing
at this An&s;wer, <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;eemed greatly con|fu&s;ed:</P>
<P>It is not to be imagined, &s;aid &s;he, that Sir
<HI>George;</HI> or, to &s;ay better, Prince <HI>Viridmore,</HI> lived
Ten Months without eating any thing to &s;upport
Nature; but &s;uch trifling Circum&s;tances are
always left out, in the Relations of Hi&s;tories;
and truly an Audience mu&s;t be very dull and
unapprehen&s;ive, that cannot conceive, without
being told, that a Man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily eat in
the Space of Ten Months.</P>
<P>But the Food Sir <HI>George</HI> lived on, replied
the Baronet, was very un&s;ub&s;tantial, and would
not afford him much Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101">
I &s;uppo&s;e, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he lived upon
&s;uch Provi&s;ions as the Fore&s;t afforded him; &s;uch as
wild Fruits, Herbs, bitter Sallads, and the
like; which, con&s;idering the Melancholy that
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, would appear a voluptuous Re|pa&s;t;
and which the unfortunate <HI>Orontes,</HI>
when he was in the &s;ame Situation, thought
infinitely too good for him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> finding <HI>Arabella</HI> took no Notice
of the Hi&s;torian's Hyperbole of living upon his
Sighs and Tears, pa&s;&s;ed it over, for fear of of|fending

he perceived <HI>Arabella</HI> was rea&s;onable enough
to &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t have eat during his Abode
in the Fore&s;t, went on with his Relation in
this Manner.</P>
<P>I lived, as I before ob&s;erved to you, Ma|dam,
in this Cave for Ten Months; and truly
I was &s;o reconciled to that &s;olitary way of Life,
and found &s;o much Sweetne&s;s in it, that I be|lieve,
I &s;hould have remained there till this
Day, but for the Adventure which I am going
to recount.</P>
<P>It being my Cu&s;tom to walk out every Even|ing
in the Fore&s;t; returning to my Cave,
&s;omething later then u&s;ual, I heard the Cries
of a Woman at &s;ome Di&s;tance, who &s;eemed to
be in Di&s;tre&s;s: I &s;topped to li&s;ten from what
Side tho&s;e Cries proceeded; and perceiving
they &s;eemed to approach nearer to me, I took
down my Armour from the Tree where I had
hung it; and ha&s;tily arming my&s;elf, &s;haped my
Cour&s;e towards the Place from whence tho&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Complaints &s;eemed to come, re&s;olving to a&s;&s;i&s;t
that unknown Per&s;on with all the Strength
that was left me.</P>
<P>Having gone &s;ome Paces, I &s;pied through
the Branches of the Trees a Man on Hor&s;e|back
with a Lady, who &s;truggled to get loo&s;e,
and at times calling aloud for Succour.</P>
<P>This Sight inflaming me with Rage again&s;t
that impious Ravi&s;her; I flew towards him:
And when I came within hearing;</P>
<P>Hold, Wretch! cried I, and cea&s;e to offer
Violence to that Lady, whom thou beare&s;t
away by Force; or prepare to defend thy&s;elf
again&s;t one, who will die, before he will &s;uffer
thee to pro&s;ecute thy unju&s;t De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Man, without an&s;wering me, clapped
Spurs to his Hor&s;e; and it would have been
impo&s;&s;ible to have overtaken him, had not my
own Hor&s;e, which had never quitted the Fore&s;t,
appeared in my View: I quickly mounted him,
and followed the Track the Ravi&s;her had taken,
with &s;uch Speed, that I came up with him in a
Moment.</P>
<P>Caitiff! &s;aid I, relea&s;e the Lady, and de|fend
thy&s;elf. The&s;e Words, which I accom|panied
with a thundering Blow upon his
Head-piece, obliged him to &s;et down the Lady,
who implored Heaven, with the utmo&s;t Ar|dour,
to grant me the Victory: And, recoiling
back a few Paces, to take a View of me,</P>
<P>I know not, &s;aid he, for what Rea&s;on thou
&s;ette&s;t thy&s;elf to oppo&s;e my De&s;igns; but I
well know, that thou &s;halt dearly repent of thy
Temerity.</P>
<P>Saying this, he advanced furiou&s;ly towards
<PB N="101" REF="103">
me, and aimed &s;o heavy a Blow at my Head,
that, had I not received it on my Shield, I
might haply have no longer been in a Condi|tion
to defend the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady: But, hav|ing,
with the greate&s;t Dexterity imaginable,
avoided this Blow, I made at him with &s;o
much Fiercene&s;s, and directed my Aims &s;o
well, that in a few Moments I wounded him
in &s;everal Places; and his Arms were all dyed
with his Blood.</P>
<P>This good Succe&s;s redoubled my Vigour;
and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword,
cut the Strings of his Head-piece, it fell off:
And his Head being bare, I was going to let
fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which doubtle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
would have &s;hivered it in a thou&s;and Pieces,
when he cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall
his Sword, by that Action a&s;&s;ured me my Vi|ctory
was intire.</P>
<P>Live Wretch, cried I, &s;ince thou art ba&s;e
enough to value Life after being vanqui&s;hed;
but &s;wear upon my Sword, that thou wilt ne|ver
more attempt the Liberty of that Lady.</P>
<P>While I was &s;peaking, I perceived he was
no longer able to &s;it his Hor&s;e: But, &s;taggering
a Moment, he fell off, and lay extended with|out
Motion upon the Ground. Touched with
Compa&s;&s;ion at this Sight, I alighted, and, &s;up|po&s;ing
him to be in a Swoon, was preparing to
give him &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, upon my nearer
Approach, I found he was quite dead.</P>
<P>Leaving therefore this mournful Object, I
I turned about, with an Intention to go and
offer the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lady my further Help; but
I perceived her already at my Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Reader will find a De&s;cription
of a Beauty, in a Style truly &s;ublime.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE new-fallen Snow, pur&s;ued Sir <HI>George,</HI>
was tanned, in Compari&s;on of the refin|ed
Purity of that White which made up the
<PB N="103" REF="105">
Ground of her Complexion; and, though Fear
had a little gathered the Carnations of her
Cheeks, yet her Joy at being delivered
&s;eemed to plant them there with &s;uch fre&s;h
Advantages, that my Eye might &s;hrink at the
Brightne&s;s of that mingled Lu&s;tre: Her Mouth,
as well for Shape as Colour, might &s;hame the
Imitation of the be&s;t Pencils, and the livelie&s;t
Tints; and though through &s;ome petty Inter|vals
of Joy, it wanted the Smiles, which Grief
and Terror &s;eque&s;tred, yet &s;he never opened it,
but like the Ea&s;t, at the Birth of a beautiful
Day, and then di&s;covered Trea&s;ures, who&s;e ex|celling
Whitene&s;s made the Price ine&s;timable:
All the Features of her Face had &s;o near a
Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry, as the
&s;everal Ma&s;ters of <HI>Apelles</HI>'s Art might have
called it his Glory to have copied Beauties from
her, as the be&s;t of Models: The Circumfe|rence
of her Vi&s;age &s;hewed the Extremes of
an imperfect Circle, and almo&s;t formed it to a
perfect Oval: And this Abridgment of Mar|vels
was tapered by a Pair of the brighte&s;t
Stars, that ever were lighted up by the Hand
of Nature: As their Colour was the &s;ame with
the Heavens, there was a &s;pherical Harmony
in their Motion; and that mingled with a Vi|vacity
&s;o penetrating, as neither the firme&s;t
Eye, nor the &s;tronge&s;t Soul, could arm them|&s;elves
with a Re&s;i&s;tance of Proof again&s;t tho&s;e
pointed Glories: Her Head was crowned with
a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair, which
Colour as fitly &s;uited the Beauty of her Eyes,
as Imagination could make it: To the&s;e Mar|vels
of Face were joined the re&s;t of her Neck,
<PB N="104" REF="106">
Hands, and Shape; and there &s;eemed a Conte&s;t
between the Form and Whitene&s;s of the two
former, which had the large&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion from
Nature to work Wonders.</P>
<P>In fine, her Beauty was miraculous, and
could not fail of producing a &s;udden Effect
upon a Heart like mine.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed in an In&s;tant from the ex|treme&s;t
Admiration, to &s;omething yet more
tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to
the fair Unknown; who told me, &s;he feared her
Father had Occa&s;ion for &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, her
Ravi&s;her having left his Men to engage him, and
keep off his Pur&s;uit, while he rode off with
his Prize: Hereupon I begg'd her to direct me
to the Place where &s;he left her Father, a&s;&s;uring
her I would gladly venture my Life a Second
time, to pre&s;erve his; and &s;he de&s;iring to go
with me, I placed her before me on my Hor&s;e,
and had the exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure of &s;upporting
with my Arms the faire&s;t and mo&s;t admirable
Creature in the World.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an Hour, which had ap|peared
to me but a Moment, we got to the
Place where &s;he had been torn from her Father;
whom we beheld with three of his Servants,
maintaining a Fight again&s;t twice as many of
their Enemies.</P>
<P>Having gently &s;et down the beauteous Un|known
upon the Gra&s;s, I flew to the Relief
of her Father; and, throwing my&s;elf furiou&s;ly
among&s;t his A&s;&s;ailants, di&s;patched two of them
with &s;o many Blows: The others, &s;eeing &s;o un|expected
an A&s;&s;i&s;tance, gave back a little; and
<PB N="105" REF="107">
I took Advantage of their Con&s;ternation, to
redouble my Blows, and brought Two more
of them at my Feet.</P>
<P>There remained now but Four to overcome;
and my Arrival having given new Vigour to
tho&s;e who&s;e Part I had taken, they &s;econded
me &s;o well, that we &s;oon had nothing more left
to do; for the re&s;t, &s;eeing their Comrades &s;lain,
&s;ought their Safety in Flight: We were too
generous to pur&s;ue them, the Blood of &s;uch
Wretches being unworthy to be &s;hed by our
Swords.</P>
<P>The fair Unknown, &s;eeing us Conquerors,
flew to embrace her Father; who, holding her
pre&s;&s;ed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon
me; then quitting her, came towards me, and,
in the mo&s;t obliging Terms imaginable, re|turned
me Thanks for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I had
brought him; and being informed by his
Daughter, of what I had done for her Pre&s;er|vation,
this old Gentleman renewed his Ac|knowlegements,
calling me the Pre&s;erver of
his Life, the valiant Defender of his Daugh|ter's
Honour, his tutelary Angel, and the
Guardian of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In fine, he loaded me with &s;o many Thanks
and Prai&s;es, that I could not choo&s;e but be in
&s;ome Confu&s;ion; and, to put an End to them, I
begged he would inform me, by what means
he came into that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He told me, that, re&s;iding in a Ca&s;tle at the
Extremity of this Fore&s;t, the Charms of his
Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord,
who&s;e Character and Per&s;on being di&s;agreeable
<PB N="106" REF="108">
both to her and him&s;elf, he had ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed
to give her to him: Thereupon he had &s;et
upon them as they were going to vi&s;it a Rela|tion
at &s;ome Di&s;tance, and, dragging <HI>Philonice</HI>
out of the Coach, put her before him on his
Hor&s;e, and carried her away, leaving Eight of
his Men to engage him, and his Servants; who,
being but Four in Number, mu&s;t inevitably
have peri&s;hed, had I not come to his Relief,
and, by my miraculous Valour, vanqui&s;hed all
his Enemies.</P>
<P>Saying this, he de&s;ired me to go home with
him to the Ca&s;tle; and having led his Daugh|ter
to the Coach, in&s;i&s;ted upon my placing my|&s;elf
next her; and, getting in him&s;elf, ordered
them to return home.</P>
<P>This Accident having altered his De&s;ign of
making the Vi&s;it which had been the Occa&s;ion
of his Journey;</P>
<P>The Baron, for that I found was his Title,
entertained me, all the Way, with repeated Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of Acknowledgements and Tenderne&s;s;
and the incomparable <HI>Philonice</HI> conde&s;cended
al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure me of her Gratitude for the Ser|vice
I had done her.</P>
<P>At our Arrival at the Ca&s;tle, I perceived it
was very large and magnificent: The Baron con|ducted
me to one of the be&s;t Apartments, and
would &s;tay in the Room till my Armour was
taken off, that he might be a&s;&s;ured I had re|ceived
no Hurts: Having rendered him the like
Civility in his own Chamber, and &s;atisfied
my&s;elf he was not wounded, we returned to
the beautiful <HI>Philonice;</HI> and this &s;econd Sight
<PB N="107" REF="109">
having fini&s;hed my Defeat, I remained &s;o ab|&s;olutely
her Slave, that neither <HI>Dorothea</HI> nor
<HI>Sydimiris</HI> were more pa&s;&s;ionately beloved.</P>
<P>At the earne&s;t Intreaty of the Baron, I &s;taid
&s;ome Weeks in the Ca&s;tle; during which, the
daily Sight of <HI>Philonice</HI> &s;o augmented my
Flames, that I was no longer in a Condition to
conceal them; but, fearing to di&s;plea&s;e that Di|vine
Beauty by a Confe&s;&s;ion of my Pa&s;&s;ion, I
langui&s;hed in &s;ecret; and the Con&s;traint I laid
upon my&s;elf, gave me &s;uch Torments, that I
fell into a profound Melancholy, and looked
&s;o pale and dejected, that the Baron was &s;en&s;i|ble
of the Alteration, and conjured me in the
mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Terms, to acquaint him with the
Cau&s;e of my Unea&s;ine&s;s: But though I conti|nued
ob&s;tinately &s;ilent with my Tongue, yet
my Eyes &s;poke intelligibly enough; and the
Blu&s;hes which appeared in the fair Cheeks
of <HI>Philonice,</HI> whenever &s;he &s;poke to me on the
Subject of my Grief, convinced me &s;he was
not ignorant of my Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length the Agitation of my Mind throw|ing
me into a Fever, the Baron, who was firmly
per&s;uaded, that my Illne&s;s proceeded from &s;ome
concealed Vexation, pre&s;&s;ed me continually to
declare my&s;elf; and, finding all his Intreaties
ineffectual, he commanded his Daughter to en|deavour
to find out the Cau&s;e of that Grief
which had put me into &s;uch a Condition.</P>
<P>For that Purpo&s;e therefore, having brought
the fair <HI>Philonice</HI> into my Chamber, he &s;taid a
few Minutes, and, leaving the Room, under
Pretence of Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Philonice</HI> remained alone
<PB N="108" REF="110">
by my Bed&s;ide, her Women, out of Re&s;pect,
&s;taying at the other End of the Chamber.</P>
<P>This Divine Per&s;on, &s;eeing her&s;elf alone with
me, and remembring her Father's Command,
blu&s;hed, and ca&s;t down her Eyes in &s;uch appa|rent
Confu&s;ion, that I could not help ob&s;erving
it: And, interpreting it to the Di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he
took in being &s;o near me,</P>
<P>Whatever Joy I take in the Honour your
Vi&s;it does me, Madam, &s;aid I, in a weak Voice;
yet &s;ince nothing is &s;o dear to me, as your Sa|tisfaction,
I would rather di&s;pen&s;e with this
Mark of your Goodne&s;s to an unfortunate
Wretch, then &s;ee you in the lea&s;t Con&s;traint.</P>
<P>And why, replied &s;he, with a Tone full of
Sweetne&s;s, do you &s;uppo&s;e that I am here by
Con&s;traint, when it would be more ju&s;t to be|lieve,
that in vi&s;iting the valiant Defender of
my Honour, and the Life of my Father, I only
follow my own Inclinations?</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, &s;aid I, tran&s;ported with Joy
at &s;o favourable a Speech, the little Service I
had the Happine&s;s to do you, does not merit
&s;o infinite a Favour; and tho' I had lo&s;t the be&s;t
Part of my Blood in your Defence, I &s;hould
have been well rewarded with your Safety.</P>
<P>Since you do not repent of what you have
done, replied &s;he, I am willing to be obliged
to you for another Favour; and a&s;k it with the
greater Hope of obtaining it, as I mu&s;t acquaint
you, it is by my Father's Command I take
that Liberty, who is much intere&s;ted in my
Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="111">
There is no Occa&s;ion, Madam, returned I,
to make u&s;e of any Intere&s;t but your own, to
engage me to obey you, &s;ince that is, and ever
will be, all-powerful with me: Speak then,
Madam, and let me know what it is you de&s;ire
of me, that I may, once in my Life, have the
Glory of obeying you.</P>
<P>It is, &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing &s;till more than before,
that you will acquaint us with the Cau&s;e of that
Melancholy, which has, as we imagine, occa|&s;ioned
your pre&s;ent Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>At the&s;e Words I trembled, turned pale; and,
not daring to di&s;cover the true Cau&s;e of my
Affliction, I remained in a profound Silence.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid the beautiful <HI>Philonice,</HI> that you
have no Inclination to obey me; and &s;ince my
Reque&s;t has, as I perceive, given you &s;ome
Di&s;turbance, I will prevail upon my Father to
pre&s;s you no farther upon this Subject.</P>
<P>No, Madam, &s;aid I, eagerly; the Baron &s;hall
be &s;atisfied, and you &s;hall be obeyed; though,
after the Knowlege of my Crime, you doom
me to that Death I &s;o ju&s;tly merit.</P>
<P>Yes Madam, this unfortunate Man, who has
had the Glory to acquire your E&s;teem by the
little Service he did you, has cancelled the Me|rit
of that Service by daring to adore you.</P>
<P>I love you, divine <HI>Philonice;</HI> and, not being
able either to repent, or cea&s;e to be guilty of
loving you, I am re&s;olved to die, and &s;pare
you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence.
I be&s;eech you therefore to believe, that I would
have died in Silence, but for your Command
to declare my&s;elf, and you &s;hould never have
<PB N="110" REF="112">
known the Exce&s;s of my Love and De&s;pair,
had not my Obedience to your Will obliged
me to confe&s;s it.</P>
<P>I fini&s;hed the&s;e Words with &s;o much Fear
and Confu&s;ion, that I dur&s;t not lift my Eyes
up to the fair Face of <HI>Philonice,</HI> to ob&s;erve how
&s;he received this Di&s;cour&s;e: I waited therefore,
trembling, for her An&s;wer; but finding that in
&s;everal Minutes &s;he &s;poke not a Word, I ven|tured
at la&s;t, to ca&s;t a langui&s;hing Glance upon
the Vi&s;age I adored, and &s;aw &s;o many Marks
of Di&s;order upon it, that I was almo&s;t dead
with the Apprehen&s;ions of having offended her
beyond even the Hope of procuring her Pardon
by my Death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Wherein Sir George concludes his Hi&s;tory;
which produces an unexpected Effect.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Silence of <HI>Philonice,</HI> continued Sir
<HI>George,</HI> pierced me to the Heart; and
when I &s;aw her ri&s;e from her Seat, and prepare
to go away without &s;peaking, Grief took &s;uch
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Spirits, that, uttering a Cry, I
fell into a Swoon, which, as I afterwards was
informed, greatly alarmed the beautiful <HI>Philo|nice;</HI>
who, re&s;uming her Seat, had the Good|ne&s;s
to a&s;&s;i&s;t her Women in bringing me to
my&s;elf; and, when I opened my Eyes, I had
<PB N="111" REF="113">
the Satisfaction to behold her &s;till by me, and
all the Signs of Compa&s;&s;ion in her Face.</P>
<P>This Sight a little re-a&s;&s;uring me; I a&s;k your
Pardon, Madam, &s;aid I, for the Condition in
which I have appeared before you, and al&s;o for
that I am not yet dead, as is doubtle&s;s your
Wi&s;h: But I will make Ha&s;te, pur&s;ued I,
&s;ighing, to fulfil your De&s;ires; and you &s;hall
&s;oon be freed from the Sight of a mi&s;erable
Wretch, who, to his la&s;t Moment, will not
cea&s;e to adore you.</P>
<P>It is not your Death that I de&s;ire, &s;aid the
fair <HI>Philonice;</HI> and, after having pre&s;erved both
my Father and me from Death, it is not rea|&s;onable,
that we &s;hould &s;uffer you to die, if we
can help it.</P>
<P>Live therefore, <HI>Bellmour,</HI> pur&s;ued &s;he, blu&s;h|ing;
and live, if po&s;&s;ible, without continuing in
that Weakne&s;s I cannot choo&s;e but condemn:
Yet whatever are your Thoughts for the future,
remember that your Death will be a Fault I
cannot re&s;olve to pardon.</P>
<P>Speaking the&s;e Words, without giving me
time to an&s;wer, &s;he left my Chamber; and I
found &s;omething &s;o &s;weet and favourable in
them, that I re&s;olved to obey her, and forward
my Cure as much as I was able: However, the
Agitation of Spirits increa&s;ed my Fever &s;o
much, that my Life was de&s;paired of.</P>
<P>The Baron hardly ever left my Bed&s;ide.
<HI>Philonice</HI> came every Day to &s;ee me, and &s;eemed
extremely moved at the Danger I was in. One
Day, when I was wor&s;e than u&s;ual, &s;he came
<PB N="112" REF="114">
clo&s;e to the Bed&s;ide; and, opening the Cour|tain,</P>
<P>What <HI>Bellmour,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, do you pay &s;o
little Obedience to my Commands, that you
re&s;olve to die?</P>
<P>Heaven is my Witne&s;s, Madam, &s;aid I,
faintly, that nothing is &s;o dear and &s;acred to
me as your Commands; and &s;ince, out of your
&s;uperlative Goodne&s;s, you are plea&s;ed to have
&s;ome Care for my Life, I would pre&s;erve it to
obey you, were it in my Power; but, alas!
Madam, I &s;trive in vain to repel the Violence
of my Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>In a few Days more, I was reduced to the
la&s;t Extremity: It was then that the fair <HI>Phi|lonice</HI>
di&s;covered, that &s;he did not hate me; for
&s;he made no Scruple to weep before me; and
tho&s;e Tears &s;he &s;o liberally &s;hed, had &s;o pow|erful
an Effect upon my Mind, that the Con|tentment
I felt, communicated it&s;elf to my
Body, and gave &s;uch a Turn to my Di&s;temper,
that my Recovery was not only hoped, but ex|pected.</P>
<P>The Baron expre&s;&s;ed his Satisfaction at this
Alteration, by the mo&s;t affectionate Expre&s;|&s;ions;
and though the fair <HI>Philonice</HI> &s;aid very
little, yet I perceived by the Joy that appeared
in her fair Eyes, that &s;he was not le&s;s intere&s;ted
in my Recovery, than her Father.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians having declared me out of
Danger, the Baron, who had taken his Re|&s;olutions
long before, came one Day into my
Chamber; and ordering tho&s;e who attended me,
to leave us alone,</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
Prince, &s;aid he, for in recounting my Hi&s;tory
to him, I had di&s;clo&s;ed my true Quality, I am
not ignorant of that Affection you bear my
Daughter; and am &s;en&s;ible it has occa&s;ioned
the Extremity to which we have &s;een you re|duced:
Had you been plea&s;ed to acquaint me
with your Sentiments, you would have avoided
tho&s;e Di&s;plea&s;ures you have &s;uffered; for though
your Birth were not &s;o illu&s;trious as it is, yet,
preferring Virtue to all other Advantages, I
&s;hould have e&s;teemed my Daughter honou|red
by your Love, and have freely be&s;towed
her on you: But &s;ince to tho&s;e rare Qualities
wherewith Heaven has &s;o liberally endowed
you, you add al&s;o that of a Birth &s;o noble,
doubt not but I &s;hall think my&s;elf highly fa|voured
by your Alliance: If therefore your
Thoughts of my Daughter be not changed,
and you e&s;teem her worthy to be your Bride, I
here &s;olemnly promi&s;e you to be&s;tow her upon
you, as &s;oon as you are perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>I leave you to gue&s;s, Madam, the Joy which
I felt at this Di&s;cour&s;e: It was &s;o great, that
it would not permit me to thank him, as I
&s;hould have done, for the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing
he be&s;towed on me.</P>
<P>I &s;aw <HI>Philonice</HI> a few Minutes after; and, being
commanded by her Father to give me her Hand,
&s;he did &s;o, without any Marks of Reluctance,
and, having re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed it, I vowed to be
her Slave for ever.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined, continued Sir
<HI>George,</HI> with a profound Sigh, that Fortune,
while &s;he thus &s;eemed to flatter me, was pre|paring
to make me &s;uffer the &s;evere&s;t Tor|ments?
<PB N="114" REF="116">
I began now to leave my Bed, and was
able to walk about my Chamber. The Baron
was making great Preparations for our Nuptials;
when one Night I was alarmed with the Cries
of <HI>Philonice</HI>'s Women; and, a few Moments
after, the Baron came into my Chamber, with
a di&s;tracted Air.</P>
<P>O! Son, cried he, for &s;o he always called
me, now <HI>Philonice</HI> is lo&s;t both to you and me:
She is carried off by Force, and I am preparing
to follow and re&s;cue her, if po&s;&s;ible; but I fear
my Endeavours will be fruitle&s;s, &s;ince I know
not which Way her Ravi&s;hers have taken.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, cried I, tran&s;ported both with Grief
and Rage, you &s;hall not go alone: Her Re&s;cue
belongs to me; and I will effect it, or peri&s;h in
the Attempt.</P>
<P>The Baron, having earne&s;tly conjured me
not to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the Danger of a Re|lap&s;e,
by &s;o imprudent a Re&s;olution, was ob|liged
to quit me, Word being brought him, that
his Hor&s;e was ready: And as &s;oon as he was
gone out of the Room, in &s;pite of all that could
be &s;aid to prevent me, by my Attendants, I
made them put on my Armour; and, mounting
a Hor&s;e I had cau&s;ed to be made ready, fallied
furiou&s;ly out of the Ca&s;tle, breathing out Vows
of Vengeance again&s;t the Wretch who had
robbed me of <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>I rode the whole Night without &s;topping.
Day appeared, when I found my&s;elf near a
&s;mall Village. I entered it, and made &s;trict
Enquiry after the Ravi&s;her of <HI>Philonice,</HI> de|&s;cribing
the fair Creature, and offering va&s;t Re|wards
to any who could bring me the lea&s;t In|telligence
<PB N="115" REF="117">
of her: But all was in vain; I could
make no Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>After travelling &s;everal Days, to no Purpo&s;e,
I returned to the Ca&s;tle, in order to know if
the Baron had been more &s;ucce&s;sful in his Pur|&s;uit
then my&s;elf; but I found him oppre&s;&s;ed
with Grief: He had heard no Tidings of his
Daughter, and had &s;uffered no &s;mall Appre|hen&s;ions
upon my Account. Having a&s;&s;ured
him I found my&s;elf very able to travel, I took
an affectionate Leave of him, promi&s;ing him
never to give over my Search, till I had found
the Divine <HI>Philonice:</HI> But Heaven has not per|mitted
me that Happine&s;s; and though I have
&s;pent &s;everal Years in &s;earching for her, I have
never been able to di&s;cover where &s;he is: Time
has not cured me of my Grief for her Lo&s;s;
and, though by an Effect of my De&s;tiny,
another Object po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my Soul, yet I do
not cea&s;e to deplore her Misfortune, and to of|fer
up Vows for her Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And is this all you have to &s;ay? &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
whom the latter Part of his Hi&s;tory had
extremely &s;urpri&s;ed; or are we to expect a
Continuance of your Adventures?</P>
<P>I have faithfully related all my Adventures,
that are worthy your Hearing, Madam, re|turned
Sir <HI>George;</HI> and I flatter my&s;elf, you
will do me the Ju&s;tice to own, that I have
been rather unfortunate than faithle&s;s; and that
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had little Rea&s;on to tax me with
Incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> &s;poke too favourably of you, when he
called you only incon&s;tant; and if he had add|ed
<PB N="116" REF="118">
the Epithet of Ungrateful and Unju&s;t, he
would have marked your Character better.</P>
<P>For, in fine, Sir, pur&s;ued &s;he, you will ne|ver
per&s;uade any rea&s;onable Per&s;on, that your
being able to lo&s;e the Remembrance of the fair
and generous <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> in your new Pa&s;&s;ion for
<HI>Philonice,</HI> was not an Exce&s;s of Levity: But
your &s;uffering &s;o tamely the Lo&s;s of this la&s;t
Beauty, and allowing her to remain in the
Hands of her Ravi&s;her, while you permit an|other
Affection to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Soul,
is &s;uch an Outrage to all Truth and Con&s;tancy,
that you de&s;erve to be ranked among the fal&s;e&s;t
of Mankind.</P>
<P>Alas! Madam, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> who had
not fore&s;een the Influence <HI>Arabella</HI> would draw
from this la&s;t Adventure, What would you
have an unfortunate Man, who&s;e Hopes have
been &s;o often, and &s;o cruelly, di&s;appointed, do?
I have bewailed the Lo&s;s of <HI>Philonice,</HI> with a
Deluge of Tears; I have taken infinite Pains to
find her, but to no Purpo&s;e; and when Hea|ven
compa&s;&s;ionating my Sufferings, pre&s;ented
to my Eyes, an Object, to whom the whole
World ought to pay Adoration, how could I
re&s;i&s;t that powerful Impul&s;e, which forced me to
love what appeared &s;o worthy of my Affection?</P>
<P>Call not, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> that an ir|re&s;i&s;tible
Impul&s;e, which was only the Effect
of thy own changing Humour: The &s;ame Ex|cu&s;e
might be pleaded for all the Faults we &s;ee
committed in the World; and Men would no
longer be an&s;werable for their own Crimes.
Had you imitated the illu&s;trious Heroes of An|tiquity,
as well in the Con&s;tancy of their Af|fections,
<PB N="117" REF="119">
as, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, you have done
in their admirable Valour; you would now be
either &s;ighing in your Cave for the Lo&s;s of the
generous <HI>Sydimiris,</HI> or wandering through the
World in Search of the beautiful <HI>Philonice.</HI>
Had you per&s;evered in your Affection, and con|tinued
your Pur&s;uit of that Fair-one; you
would, perhaps, ere this, have found her &s;leep|ing
under the Shade of a Tree in &s;ome lone Fo|re&s;t,
as <HI>Philoda&s;pes</HI> did his admirable <HI>Delia,</HI> or
di&s;gui&s;ed in a Slave's Habit, as <HI>Ariobar&s;anes</HI> &s;aw
his Divine <HI>Olympia;</HI> or bound haply in a Cha|riot,
and have had the Glory of freeing her, as
<HI>Ambriomer</HI> did the beauteous <HI>Agione;</HI> or in a
Ship in the Hands of Pirates, like the incom|parable
<HI>Eliza;</HI> or&mdash;</P>
<P>Enough, dear Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles;</HI>
you have quoted Examples &s;ufficient, if this in|con&s;tant
Man would have the Grace to follow
them.</P>
<P>True, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I would
recommend to his Con&s;ideration the Conduct
of tho&s;e illu&s;trious Per&s;ons I have named, to the
end that, pur&s;uing their Steps, he may arrive
at their Glory and Happine&s;s, that is the Repu|tation
of being perfectly con&s;tant, and the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s: And be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, pur|&s;ued
<HI>Arabella,</HI> looking at Sir <HI>George,</HI> that Hea|ven
will never re&s;tore you the Crown of your
Ance&s;tors, and place you upon the Throne to
which you pretend, while you make your&s;elf
unworthy of its Protection, by &s;o &s;hameful an
Incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>I perhaps &s;peak with too much Freedom to a
great Prince; whom though Fortune has de|&s;poiled
<PB N="118" REF="120">
of his Dominions, is intitled to a certain
Degree of Re&s;pect: But I conceive, it belongs
to me, in a particular manner, to re&s;ent the
Ba&s;ene&s;s of that Crime, to which you are plea&s;|ed
to make me the Excu&s;e; and, looking upon
my&s;elf, as di&s;honoured by tho&s;e often pro&s;tituted
Vows you have offered me, I am to tell you,
that I am highly di&s;obliged; and forbid you to
appear in my Pre&s;ence again, till you have re|&s;umed
tho&s;e Thoughts, which are worthy your
noble Extraction; and are capable of treating
me with that Re&s;pect, that is my Due.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he ro&s;e from he Seat, and walk|ed
very maje&s;tically out of the Room, leaving
Sir <HI>George</HI> overwhelmed with Shame and Vexa|tion
at having conducted the latter Part of his
Narration &s;o ill, and drawn upon him&s;elf a
Sentence, which deprived him of all his Hopes.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively delighted with

Silence, and down-ca&s;t Looks, to expect it.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined, &s;aid he, that &s;o

<P>Don't triumph, dear <HI>Charles,</HI> replied Sir

could be more unfortunate, than that
damn'd Slip I made at the latter End of my
Hi&s;tory: But for that, my Reputation for

Ods-heart! It is pity you are not poor enough

<P>Upon my Soul, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI>
thou art &s;uch an ill-natured Fellow, that I am
afraid, thou wilt be &s;neering at me when I am
gone; and wilt endeavour, to per&s;uade Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> that not a Syllable of my Story is true.
Speak, pur&s;ued he, Wilt thou have the Cruelty
to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great
Kingdom of <HI>Kent;</HI> and rob me of the Glory
of fighting &s;ingly again&s;t Five hundred Men?</P>
<P>I do not know, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> whether
my Niece be really impo&s;ed upon, by the Gra|vity
with which you told your &s;urpri&s;ing Hi|&s;tory;
but I prote&s;t, I thought you were in ear|ne&s;t
at fir&s;t; and that you meant to make us
believe it all to be Fact.</P>
<P>You are &s;o fitly puni&s;hed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
for that ill-judged Adventure you related
la&s;t, by the bad Opinion Lady <HI>Bella</HI> entertains
of you, that I need not add to your Mi&s;fortune:
And therefore, you &s;hall be Prince <HI>Veridomer,</HI> if
you plea&s;e; &s;ince, under that Character, you
<PB N="121" REF="123">
are obliged not to pretend to any Lady, but
the incomparable <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who under&s;tood his Meaning,
went home, to think of &s;ome Means, by which
he might draw him&s;elf out of the Embarra&s;&s;|ment
he was in; and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as he had
promi&s;ed, did not endeavour to undeceive Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> with regard to the Hi&s;tory he had feign|ed;
being very well &s;atisfied with his having
put it out of his Power to make his Addre&s;&s;es
to her, &s;ince &s;he now looked upon him as the
Lover of <HI>Philonice.</HI></P>
<P>As for Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> he did not penetrate into
the Meaning of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Story; and only
imagined, that by relating &s;uch a Heap of Ad|ventures,
he had a De&s;ign to entertain the
Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of
his Invention; and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;up|po&s;ed,
he had been ridiculing her Cou&s;in's
&s;trange Notions, was better plea&s;ed with him
than ever.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> however, was le&s;s &s;atisfied than
any of them: She could not endure to &s;ee &s;o
brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a
Race of Kings, tarni&s;h the Glory of his gallant
Actions by &s;o ba&s;e a Perfidy.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, How much Rea|&s;on
has the beautiful <HI>Philonice</HI> to accu&s;e me for
all the Angui&s;h &s;he &s;uffers? &s;ince I am the
Cau&s;e, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom
&s;he be&s;tows her Affections, &s;uffers her to re|main
quietly, in the Hands of her Ravi&s;her,
without endeavouring to re&s;cue her: But, Oh!
too lovely, and unfortunate Fair-one, &s;aid &s;he,
as if &s;he had been pre&s;ent, and li&s;tening to her,
<PB N="122" REF="124">
di&s;tingui&s;h, I be&s;eech you, between tho&s;e Faults,
which the Will, and tho&s;e which Nece&s;&s;ity, makes
us commit. I am the Cau&s;e, 'tis true, of thy
Lover's Infidelity; but I am the innocent
Cau&s;e; and would repair the Evils, my fatal
Beauty gives Ri&s;e to, by any Sacrifice in my
Power to make.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella,</HI> by her romantic Genero|&s;ity,
bewails the imaginary Afflictions of the
full as imaginary <HI>Philonice;</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
thought the Solitude &s;he lived in, confirmed
her in her ab&s;urd and ridiculous Notions, de|&s;ired
his Father to pre&s;s her to go to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> complied with his Reque&s;t, and
earne&s;tly intreated her to leave the Ca&s;tle, and
&s;pend a few Months in Town. Her Year of
Mourning being now expired, &s;he con&s;ented to
go; but Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who did not think his
Son's Health ab&s;olutely confirmed, propo&s;ed to

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_SIR <HI>George,</HI> to gratify <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Humour, had not pre&s;umed to
come to the Ca&s;tle for &s;everal
Days; but, hearing that they were
preparing to leave the Country,
he wrote a &s;hort Billet to her; and in the Style
of Romance, mo&s;t humbly intreated her to
grant him a Moment's Audience.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> being informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s Gentleman had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, that
he had brought a Letter from his Ma&s;ter, &s;he
<PB N="124" REF="126">
ordered her to bring him to her Apartment, and
as &s;oon as he appeared,</P>
<P>How comes it, &s;aid &s;he, that the Prince your
Ma&s;ter, has had the Pre&s;umption to impor|tune
me again, after my ab&s;olute Commands to
the contrary?</P>
<P>The Prince, my Ma&s;ter, Madam, &s;aid the
Man, exce&s;&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ay! &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> Are you not Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
'Squire? And does he not tru&s;t you with his
mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts?</P>
<P>I belong to Sir <HI>George Bellmour,</HI> Madam,
replied the Man, who did not under&s;tand what
She meant: I have not the Honour to be a
'Squire.</P>
<P>No! interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> 'tis &s;trange then,
that he &s;hould have honoured you with his Com|mi&s;&s;ion;
Pray, what is it you come to reque&s;t
for him?</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter, Madam, &s;aid he, ordered me
to get this Letter delivered to your Lady&s;hip,
and to &s;tay for your Commands.</P>
<P>You would per&s;uade me, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ternly,
being provoked that he did not deliver the
Letter upon his Knees, as was the Cu&s;tom in
Romances, that you are not acquainted with
the Purport of this audacious Billet, &s;ince you
expre&s;s &s;o little Fear of my Di&s;plea&s;ure; but
know, pre&s;umptuous, that I am mortally
offended with your Ma&s;ter, for his daring to
&s;uppo&s;e I would read this Proof at once of
his In&s;olence and Infidelity; and was you worth
my Re&s;entment, I would haply make you &s;uffer
for your Want of Re&s;pect to me.</P>
<P>The poor Man, &s;urpri&s;ed and confounded at
<PB N="125" REF="127">
her Anger, and puzzled extremely; to under|&s;tand
what &s;he meant, was opening his Mouth
to &s;ay &s;omething, 'tis probable in his own De|fence,
when <HI>Arabella,</HI> preventing him,</P>
<P>I know what thou would&s;t &s;ay, &s;aid &s;he:
Thou would&s;t abu&s;e my Patience by a fal&s;e
Detail of thy Ma&s;ter's Sighs, Tears, Excla|mations,
and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I don't intend to &s;ay any
&s;uch Thing, replied the Man.</P>
<P>No! repeated <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little di&s;ap|pointed,
Bear back his pre&s;umptuous Billet,
which, I &s;uppo&s;e, contains the melancholy Ac|count;
and tell him, He that could &s;o &s;oon
forget the generous <HI>Sydimiris</HI> for <HI>Philonice,</HI> and
could afterwards be fal&s;e to that incomparable
Beauty, is not a Per&s;on worthy to adore <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>The Man, who could not tell what to make
of this Me&s;&s;age, and feared he &s;hould forget
the&s;e two hard Names, humbly intreated her
to be plea&s;ed to acquaint his Ma&s;ter, by a Line,
with her Intentions. <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing he
meant to importune her &s;till more, made a
Sign with her Hand, very maje&s;tically, for
him to be gone; but he, not able to compre|hend
her Meaning, &s;tood &s;till, with an Air of
Perplexity, not daring to beg her to explain
her&s;elf; &s;uppo&s;ing, &s;he, by that Sign, required
&s;omething of him.</P>
<P>Why do&s;t thou not obey my Commands?
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> finding he did not go.</P>
<P>I will, to be &s;ure, Madam, replied he;
wi&s;hing at the &s;ame time &s;ecretly, &s;he would
let him know what they were.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;aid &s;he ha&s;tily, thou art di&s;obey|ing
<PB N="126" REF="128">
me this Moment: Did I not bid you get
out of my Pre&s;ence, and to &s;peak no more
of your incon&s;tant Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Crimes have
rendered him the Dete&s;tation of all generous
Per&s;ons whatever?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Me&s;&s;enger, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed
at &s;o har&s;h a Character of his Ma&s;ter, and the
Rage with which the Lady &s;eemed to be actu|ated,
made ha&s;te to get out of her Apartment;
and, at his Return, informed his Ma&s;ter, very
exactly, of the Reception he had met with,
repeating all Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Words; which, not|with&s;tanding
the Blunders he made in the Names
of <HI>Sydimiris</HI> and <HI>Philonice,</HI> Sir <HI>George</HI> under|&s;tood
well enough; and found new Occa&s;ion of
wondering at the Exce&s;s of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Extrava|gance,
who he never imagined would have ex|plained
her&s;elf in that Manner to his Servant.</P>
<P>Without endeavouring therefore to &s;ee <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
he went to pay his Compliments to Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> to
the la&s;t of which he &s;aid &s;ome &s;oft things, that

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Not &s;o long as was fir&s;t intended; but con|tains,
however, a &s;urpri&s;ing Adventure
on the Road.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Day of their Departure being come,
they &s;et out in a Coach and Six, attended
by &s;everal Servants on Hor&s;eback. The Fir&s;t
<PB N="127" REF="129">
Day's Journey pa&s;&s;ed off, without any Acci|dent
worthy relating; but, towards the Clo&s;e of
the Second, they were alarmed by the Ap|pearance
of three Highwaymen, well mounted,
at a &s;mall Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>One of the Servants, who had fir&s;t &s;pied
them, immediately rode up to the Coach; and,
for fear of alarming the Ladies, whi&s;pered Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> in the Ear.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who was &s;itting next his Son, and
had heard it, cried out with too little Caution,
How's this? Are we in any Danger of being at|tacked,
&s;ay you?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> without replying, jumped
out of the Coach; at which Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
&s;creamed out; and, le&s;t her Father &s;hould fol|low,
whipped into her Brother's Sear, and held
him fa&s;t by the Coat.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being in a &s;trange Con&s;ternation at
all this, put her Head out of the Coach, to &s;ee
what was the Matter; and, ob&s;erving Three or
Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Hor&s;e-back,
who &s;eemed to halt, and gaze on them&punc;
without offering to advance;</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he to her Uncle, are they yonder
Knights whom you &s;uppo&s;e will attack us?</P>
<P>Ay, ay, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> they are Knights
of the Road indeed: I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall have a
Bout with them; for it will be &s;candalous to
deliver, &s;ince we have the Odds of our Side,
and are more than a Match for them.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> interpreting the&s;e Words in her
own Way, looked out again; and, &s;eeing the
Robbers, who had by this time taken their
Re&s;olution, galloping towards them, her Cou|&s;in
<PB N="128" REF="130">
and the Servants ranging them&s;elves of each
Side of the Coach, as if to defend them,</P>
<P>Hold, hold, valiant Men, &s;aid &s;he, as loud
as &s;he could &s;peak, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the
Highwaymen; do not, by a mi&s;taken Genero|&s;ity,
hazard your Lives in a Combat, to which
the Laws of Honour do not oblige you: We
are not violently carried away, as you fal&s;ly
&s;uppo&s;e; we go willingly along with the&s;e Per|&s;ons,
who are our Friends and Relations.</P>
<P>Hey-day! cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;tarting at her
with great Surprize; what's the Meaning of all
this? Do you think the&s;e Fellows will mind your
fine Speeches, Niece?</P>
<P>I hope they will, Sir, &s;aid &s;he: Then, pulling
her Cou&s;in, &s;hew your&s;elf, for Heaven's Sake,
Mi&s;s, pur&s;ued &s;he, and &s;econd my A&s;&s;urances,
that we are not forced away: The&s;e generous
Men come to fight for our Deliverance.</P>
<P>The Highwaymen, who were near enough
to hear <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Voice, though they could
not di&s;tingui&s;h her Words, gazed on her with
great Surprize; and, finding they would be very
well received, thought fit to abandon their En|terprize,
and galloped away as fa&s;t as they were
able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to
pur&s;ue them; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> forbad it; and,
entering again into the Coach, congratulated
the Ladies upon the E&s;cape they had.</P>
<P>Since the&s;e Men, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> did not come
to deliver us, out of a mi&s;taken Notion, that
we were carried away by Force, it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
follow, they had &s;ome bad De&s;ign; and
I prote&s;t I know not who to &s;u&s;pect is the Au|thor
of it, unle&s;s the Per&s;on you vanqui&s;hed,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
&s;aid &s;he to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> the other Day in a
&s;ingle Combat; for the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Edward,</HI> you
a&s;&s;ured me, was dead: But perhaps, continued
&s;he, it was &s;ome Lover of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s,
who de&s;igned to make an Attempt to carry her
away: Methinks he was too &s;lenderly attended
for &s;uch an hazardous Undertaking.</P>
<P>I'll a&s;&s;ure you Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I have no Lovers among Highwaymen.</P>
<P>Highwaymen! repeated <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Why, ay, to be &s;ure, Madam, rejoined Sir
<HI>Charles:</HI> What do you take them for?</P>
<P>For Per&s;ons of Quality, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and though they came que&s;tionle&s;s, either
upon a good or bad De&s;ign, yet it cannot be
doubted, but that their Birth is illu&s;trious;
otherwi&s;e they would never pretend either to
fight in our Defence, or to carry us away.</P>
<P>I vow, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I can't po&s;&s;i|bly
under&s;tand you.</P>
<P>My Cou&s;in, Sir, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
has been mi&s;taken in the&s;e Per&s;ons; and has not
yet, po&s;&s;ibly, believed them to be Highwaymen,
who came to rob us.</P>
<P>There is no Que&s;tion, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
&s;miling, that if they did not come to defend
us, they came to rob you: But it is hard to
gue&s;s, which of us it was of whom they de|&s;igned
to deprive you; for it may very po&s;&s;ibly
be for my Cou&s;in's fake, as well as mine, that
this Enterprize was undertaken.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was willing to prevent his Father from an|&s;wering
her Ab&s;urdities; the&s;e Men had no
other De&s;ign, than to rob us of our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132">
How! &s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI> Were the&s;e Cavaliers&punc;
who appeared to be in &s;o hand&s;ome a Garb,

were they Robbers? I have been &s;trangely mi&s;|taken,
it &s;eems: However, I apprehend there is
no Certainty, that your Su&s;picions are true; and
it may &s;till be as I &s;ay, that they either came to
re&s;cue or carry us away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to avoid a longer Di&s;pute,
changed the Di&s;cour&s;e; having ob&s;erved with

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes with an authentic Piece
of Hi&s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> during the re&s;t of this Jour|ney,
was &s;o wholly taken up in contem|plating
upon the la&s;t Adventure, that &s;he mixed
but little in the Conver&s;ation. Upon their
drawing near <HI>Bath,</HI> the Situation of that City
afforded her the Means of making a Com|pari&s;on
between the Valley in which it was
placed (with the Amphitheatrical View of the
Hills around it) and the Valley of <HI>Tempe.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas in &s;uch a Place as this, &s;aid &s;he, pur|&s;uing
her Compari&s;on, that the fair <HI>Andronice</HI>
delivered the valiant <HI>Horten&s;ius:</HI> And really I
could wi&s;h, our Entrance into that City might
<PB N="131" REF="133">
be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity
with that of that fair Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>For the Gratification of that Wi&s;h, Madam,
&s;id Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome Per&s;on
&s;hould meet with a Misfortune, out of which
you might be able to relieve him; but I &s;uppo&s;e
the Benevolence of your Di&s;po&s;ition may be
equally &s;atisfied with not finding any Occa&s;ion,
as of exerci&s;ing it, when it is found.</P>
<P>Though it be not my Fortune to meet with
tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> there is no
Rea&s;on to doubt but others do, who po&s;&s;ibly
have le&s;s Inclination to afford their A&s;&s;i&s;tance
than my&s;elf: And it is po&s;&s;ible, if any other
than the Prince&s;s of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> had happened to
pa&s;s by, when <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> was in the Hands of
the <HI>The&s;&s;alians,</HI> he would not have been re&s;|cued
from the ignominious Death he was de|&s;tined
to, merely for killing a Stork.</P>
<P>How! interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> put a Man to
Death for killing a Stork! Ridiculous! Pray, in
what Part of the World did that happen?
Among the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>No, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;aly;</HI> the faire&s;t
Part in all <HI>Macedonia,</HI> famous for the beautiful
Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> which excited the Curio&s;ity
of all Travellers whatever.</P>
<P>No, not all, Madam, returned Sir <HI>Charles&punc;</HI>
for I am acquainted with &s;everal Travellers,
who never &s;aw it, nor even mentioned it; and
if it is &s;o famous as you &s;ay, I am &s;urpri&s;ed I
never heard of it before.</P>
<P>I don't know, &s;aid <HI>Arab&eacute;lla,</HI> what tho&s;e Tra|vellers
thought worthy of their Notice; but I
am certain, that if any Chance &s;hould conduct
<PB N="132" REF="134">
me into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> I would not leave it till I
&s;aw the Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> &s;o celebrated by all
the Poets and Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Dear Cou&s;in, cried <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could
hardly forbear &s;miling, what Chance, in the
Name of Wonder, &s;hould take you into <HI>Ma|cedonia,</HI>
at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from your own
Country?</P>
<P>And &s;o, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> this famous Valley
of <HI>Tempe</HI> is in <HI>Turky.</HI> Why you mu&s;t be
very fond of travelling, indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
if you would go into the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Country,
where the People are all Pagans, they &s;ay,
and wor&s;hip the Devil.</P>
<P>The Country my Cou&s;in &s;peaks of, &s;aid Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> is in the Grand Signor's Domi|nions:
The Great Mogul, you know, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> the Great
Mogul, or the Grand Signor, I know not
what you call him: But I hope my Niece does
not propo&s;e to go thither.</P>
<P>Not unle&s;s I am forcibly carried thither, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella;</HI> but I do determine, if that Misfor|tune
&s;hould ever happen to me, that I would,
if po&s;&s;ible, vi&s;it the Vale of <HI>Tempe,</HI> which is
in that Part of <HI>Greece</HI> they call <HI>Macedonia.</HI></P>
<P>Then I am per&s;uaded, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
you'll never &s;ee that famous Valley you talk of;
for it is not very likely you &s;hould be forcibly
carried away into <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>And why do you think it unlikely, that I
&s;hould be carried thither? interrupted <HI>Arabella.</HI>
Do not the &s;ame Things happen now, that
did formerly? And is any thing more common,
then Ladies being carried, by their Ravi&s;hers,
<PB N="133" REF="135">
into Countries far di&s;tant from their own? May
not the &s;ame Accidents happen to me, that have
happened to &s;o many illu&s;trious Ladies before
me? And may I not be carried into <HI>Macedonia</HI>
by a Similitude of De&s;tiny with that of a great
many beautiful Prince&s;&s;es, who, though born in
the mo&s;t di&s;tant Quarters of the World, chanced
to meet at one time in the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
and related their miraculous Adventures to each
other?</P>
<P>And it was for that very Purpo&s;e they met,
Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;miling.</P>
<P>Why, truly, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> it happened very
luckily for each of them, that they were
brought into a Place where they found &s;o many
illu&s;trious Companions in Misfortune, to whom
they might freely communicate their Adven|tures,
which otherwi&s;e might, haply, have been
concealed, or, at lea&s;t, have been imperfectly
delivered down to us: However, added &s;he,
&s;miling, if I am carried into <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and
by that means have an Opportunity of vi&s;it|ing
the famous Vale of <HI>Tempe,</HI> I &s;hall take care
not to draw the Re&s;entment of the <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI>
upon me, by an Indi&s;cretion like that of <HI>Hor|ten&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>For be plea&s;ed to know, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to her Uncle, that his killing a
Stork, however incon&s;iderable a Matter it may
appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime
of a very atrocious Nature among the <HI>The&s;|&s;alians;</HI>
for they have a Law, which forbids,
upon Pain of Death, the killing of Storks;
the Rea&s;on for which is, that <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> being &s;ub|ject
to be infe&s;ted with a prodigious Multitude
<PB N="134" REF="136">
of Serpents, which are a delightful Food to
the&s;e Sorts of Fowls, they look upon them as
&s;acred Birds, &s;ent by the Gods to deliver them
from the&s;e Serpents and Vipers: And though
<HI>Horten&s;ius,</HI> being a Stranger, was pardoned
through the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Prince&s;s <HI>Andro|nice,</HI>
they made him promi&s;e to &s;end another
Stork into <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> to the end that he might
be reputed innocent.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which one of our Heroine's Whims is
ju&s;tified, by &s;ome others full as whim|&s;ical.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS Piece of Hi&s;tory, with Sir <HI>Charles</HI>'s
Remarks upon it, brought them into
<HI>Bath.</HI> Their Lodgings being provided before|hand,
the Ladies retired to their different Cham|bers,
to repo&s;e them&s;elves after the Fatigue
of their Journey, and did not meet again till
Supper was on Table; when Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
who had eagerly enquired what Company
was then in the Place, and heard there were a
great many Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion ju&s;t arrived,
pre&s;t <HI>Arabella</HI> to go to the Pump-Room the
next Morning, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he would find a
very agreeable Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> accordingly con&s;ented to accompany
her; and, being told the Ladies went in an Un|dre&s;s
of a Morning, &s;he accommodated her&s;elf
to the Cu&s;tom, and went in a negligent Dre&s;s;
but in&s;tead of a Capuchin, &s;he were &s;omething
<PB N="135" REF="137">
like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered
almo&s;t all her Face, and Part of her Wai&s;t, and
gave her a very &s;ingular Appearance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was too envious of her Cou|&s;in's
Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform
her of any Oddity in her Dre&s;s, which &s;he
thought might expo&s;e her to the Ridicule of
tho&s;e that &s;aw her; and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was too
little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be &s;en&s;ible
that <HI>Arabella</HI> was not in the Fa&s;hion; and &s;ince
every thing &s;he wore became her extremely,
he could not choo&s;e but think &s;he dre&s;t ad|mirably
well: He handed her therefore, with a
great deal of Satisfaction, into the Pump-Room,
which happened to be greatly crouded
that Morning.</P>
<P>The Attention of mo&s;t Part of the Compa|ny
was immediately engaged by the Appear|ance
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> made. Strangers are here mo&s;t
&s;trictly criticized, and every new Object affords
a delicious Fea&s;t of Raillery and Scandal.</P>
<P>The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of
her Dre&s;s, crouded together in Parties; and
the Words, Who can &s;he be? Strange Crea|ture!
Ridiculous! and other Exclamations of
the &s;ame Kind, were whi&s;pered very intelli|gibly.</P>
<P>The Men were &s;truck with her Figure,
veiled as &s;he was: Her fine Stature, the beauti|ful
Turn of her Per&s;on, the Grace and Ele|gance
of her Motion, attracted all their No|tice:
The Phaenomena of the Veil, however,
gave them great Di&s;turbance. So lovely a Per|&s;on
&s;eemed to promi&s;e the Owner had a Face
not unworthy of it; but that was totally hid
<PB N="136" REF="138">
from their View: For <HI>Arabella,</HI> at her En|trance
into the Room, had pulled the Gauze
quite over her Face, following therein the Cu&s;|tom
of the Ladies in <HI>Clelia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Cy|rus,</HI>
who, in mixed Companies, always hid their
Faces with great Care.</P>
<P>The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at the
envious Covering, and compared her to the
Sun ob&s;cured by a Cloud; while the Beaux
<HI>dem'd</HI> the horrid Innovation, and expre&s;&s;ed a
Fear, le&s;t it &s;hould grow into a Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Some of the wi&s;er Sort took her for a Fo|reigner;
others, of &s;till more Sagacity, &s;uppo&s;ed
her a <HI>Scots</HI> Lady, covered with her Plaid; and
a third Sort, infinitely wi&s;er than either, con|cluded
&s;he was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nun, that had e&s;caped
from a Convent, and had not yet quitted her
Veil.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> ignorant of the Diver&s;ity of Opi|nions,
to which her Appearance gave Ri&s;e, was
taken up in di&s;cour&s;ing with Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs, the
Oeconomy of the Baths, the Nature of the
Diver&s;ions, and &s;uch other Topics, as the
Objects around them furni&s;hed her with.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was got
amid&s;t a Croud of her Acquaintance, who had
hardly paid the Civilities of a fir&s;t Meeting, be|fore
they eagerly inquired, who that Lady &s;he
brought with her was.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> informed them, that &s;he was
her Cou&s;in, and Daughter to the decea&s;ed Mar|quis
of&mdash;adding with a Sneer, That &s;he had
been brought up in the Country; knew nothing
of the World; and had &s;ome very peculiar No|tions,
<PB N="137" REF="139">
as you may &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, by that odd
kind of Covering &s;he wears.</P>
<P>Her Name and Quality were pre&s;ently whi&s;|pered
all over the Room: The Men, hearing
&s;he was a great Heire&s;s, found greater Beauties
to admire in her Per&s;on: The Ladies, aw'd
by the Sanction of Quality, dropt their Ridi|cule
on her Dre&s;s, and began to quote Exam|ples
of Whims full as inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>One remembred, that Lady <HI>J&mdash;T&mdash;</HI> al|always
wore her Ruffles rever&s;ed; that the
Counte&s;s of&mdash;went to Court in a Far|thingale;
that the Duche&s;s of&mdash;&s;at a&s;tride
upon a Hor&s;e; and a certain Lady of great
Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, becau&s;e
&s;he was not dignified with a Title, invented a
new one for her&s;elf; and directed her Servants
to &s;ay in &s;peaking to her, <HI>Your Honoure&s;s,</HI> which
afterwards became a Cu&s;tom among all her Ac|quaintance;
who mortally offended her, if
they omitted that In&s;tance of Re&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing &s;ome hi&s;torical Anecdotes, the
Truth of which may po&s;&s;ibly be doubted,
as they are not to be found in any of the
Hi&s;torians.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER a &s;hort Stay in the Room, <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
expre&s;&s;ing a De&s;ire to return home,
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> conducted her out. Two Gentle|men
of his Acquaintance attending Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="140">
Sir, <HI>Charles</HI> detained them to Breakfa&s;t;
by which means they had an Opportunity of
&s;atisfying their Curio&s;ity; and beheld <HI>Arabella,</HI>
dive&s;ted of that Veil, which had, as they &s;aid;
and 'tis probable they &s;aid no more than they
thought, concealed one of the fine&s;t Faces in
the World.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> had the Mortification to &s;ee
both the Gentlemen &s;o charmed with the Sight
of her Cou&s;in's Face, that for a long time &s;he
&s;at wholly neglected; but the Seriou&s;ne&s;s of her
Behaviour, giving &s;ome little Di&s;gu&s;t to the
younge&s;t of them, who was what the Ladies
call a Pretty-Fellow, a dear Creature, and the
mo&s;t diverting Man in the World; he applied
him&s;elf wholly to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> and &s;oon en|gaged
her in a particular Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> &s;o was the other Gentleman
called, was of a much graver Ca&s;t: He affected
to be thought deep-read in Hi&s;tory, and never
failed to take all Opportunities of di&s;playing
his Knowlege of Antiquity, which was indeed
but very &s;uperficial; but having &s;ome few Anec|dotes
by Heart, which he would take Occa|tion
to introduce as often as he could, he pa&s;&s;ed
among many Per&s;ons for one, who, by Appli|cation
and Study, had acquired an univer&s;al
Knowlege of antient Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Speaking of any particular Circum&s;tance, he
would fix the Time, by computing the Year
with the Number of the Olympiads.</P>
<P>It happened, he would &s;ay, in the 141&s;t
Olympiad.</P>
<P>Such an amazing Exactne&s;s, had a &s;uitable
<PB N="139" REF="141">
Effect on his Audience, and always procured
him a great Degree of Attention.</P>
<P>This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportu|nity
of di&s;playing his Knowledge of Hi&s;tory,
the Di&s;cour&s;e having wholly turned upon News,
and other Trifles; when <HI>Arabella,</HI> after &s;ome
more Inquiries concerning the Place, remark|ed,
that there was a very great Difference be|tween
the medicinal Waters at <HI>Bath,</HI> and the
fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain <HI>Ther|mopylae</HI>
in <HI>Greece,</HI> as well in their Qualities, as
manner of u&s;ing them; and I am of Opinion,
added &s;he, that <HI>Bath,</HI> famous as it is for re|&s;toring
Health, is le&s;s frequented by infirm
Per&s;ons, than the famous Springs of <HI>Thermopylae</HI>
were by the Beauties of <HI>Greece,</HI> to whom tho&s;e
Waters have the Reputation of giving new
Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who, with all his Reading, had
never met with any Account of the&s;e celebrated
<HI>Grecian</HI> Springs, was extremely di&s;concerted at
not being able to continue a Conver&s;ation,
which the Silence of the re&s;t of the Company
made him imagine, was directed wholly to
him.</P>
<P>The Shame he conceived at &s;eeing him&s;elf
po&s;ed by a Girl, in a Matter which &s;o imme|diately
belonged to him, made him re&s;olve to
draw him&s;elf out of this Dilemma at any Rate;
aud, though he was far from being convinced,
that there were no &s;uch Springs at <HI>Thermopylae</HI> as
<HI>Arabella</HI> mentioned; yet he re&s;olutely main|tained,
that &s;he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in their Situa|tion;
for, to his certain Knowlege, there were
<PB N="140" REF="142">
no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Moun|tain.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who could not endure to be con|tradicted
in what &s;he took to be &s;o inconte&s;t|able
a Fact, reddened with Vexation at his un|expected
Denial.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem, &s;aid &s;he, by your Di&s;cour&s;e,
that you are unacquainted with many material
Pa&s;&s;ages, that pa&s;&s;ed among very illu&s;trious
Per&s;ons there; and if you knew any thing of
<HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> you would know, that
an Adventure he had at tho&s;e Baths, laid the
Foundation of all tho&s;e great De&s;igns, which he
afterwards effected, to the total Subver&s;ion of
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed that this Piece of Hi|&s;tory
had likewi&s;e e&s;caped his Ob&s;ervation, re|&s;olved,
however, not to give up his Point.</P>
<P>I think, Madam, replied he, with great
Self-&s;ufficiency, that I am pretty well acquaint|ed
with every thing which relates to the Af|fairs
of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Commonwealth; and know
by what Steps <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> advanced him&s;elf to
the Sovereignty. It was a great Stroke of Po|licy
in him, &s;aid he, turning to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
indeed, to wound him&s;elf, in order to get a
Guard a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>You are mi&s;taken, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> if you
believe, there was any Truth in the Report of
his having wounded him&s;elf: It was done, either
by his Rival <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or <HI>Theocrites;</HI> who be|lieving
him &s;till to be in Love with the fair
<HI>Cerinthe,</HI> whom he courted, took that Way to
get rid of him: Neither is it true, that Am|bition
alone in&s;pired <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> with a De&s;ign of
<PB N="141" REF="143">
en&s;laving his Country: Tho&s;e Authors who &s;ay
&s;o, mu&s;t know little of the Springs and Motives
of his Conduct. It was neither Ambition nor
Revenge, that made him act as he did; it was
the violent Affection he conceived for the beau|tiful
<HI>Chorante,</HI> whom he fir&s;t &s;aw at the famous
Baths of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> which put him upon tho&s;e
De&s;igns; for, &s;eeing that <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who was
not his Rival in Ambition, but Love, would
certainly become the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of <HI>Chorante,</HI> un|le&s;s
he made him&s;elf Tyrant of <HI>Athens,</HI> he had
recour&s;e to that violent Method, in order to
pre&s;erve her for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> ca&s;ting
down his Eyes in great Confu&s;ion at her &s;u|perior
Knowlege in Hi&s;tory, the&s;e Particu|lars
have all e&s;caped my Notice; and this is the
fir&s;t time I ever under&s;tood, that <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> was
violently in Love; and that it was not Ambi|tion,
which made him a&s;pire to Sovereignty.</P>
<P>I do not remember any Mention of this in
<HI>Plutarch,</HI> continued he, rubbing his Forehead,
or any of the Authors who have treated on the
Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Very likely, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> but you
will &s;ee the whole Story of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI>'s Love
for <HI>Chorante,</HI> with the Effects it produced, re|lated
at large in <HI>Scudery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scudery,</HI> Madam! &s;aid the &s;age Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
I never read that Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>No, Sir! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> then your Read|ing
has been very confined.</P>
<P>I know, Madam, &s;aid he, that <HI>Herodotus,
Thucydides,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> have indeed quoted
him frequently.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">
I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was exce&s;&s;ively diverted at this Di&s;covery of
his great Ignorance and Affectation, that you
have not read that famous Hi&s;torian; e&s;pecially,
as the Writers you have mentioned quote him
&s;o often.</P>
<P>Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, &s;aid he;
though he was a <HI>Roman;</HI> yet it is objected to
him, that he wrote but indifferent <HI>Latin;</HI> with
no Purity or Elegance; and&mdash;</P>
<P>You are quite mi&s;taken, Sir, interrupted
<HI>Arabella;</HI> the great <HI>Scudery</HI> was a <HI>Frenchman;</HI>
and both his <HI>Clelia</HI> and <HI>Artamenes</HI> were written
in <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI> was he? &s;aid Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> with
a lofty Air: Oh! then, 'tis not &s;urpri&s;ing,
that I have not read him: I read no Authors,
but the Antients, Madam, added he, with a
Look of Self-applau&s;e; I cannot reli&s;h the Mo|derns
at all: I have no Ta&s;te for their Way of
Writing.</P>
<P>But <HI>Scudery</HI> mu&s;t needs be more ancient
than <HI>Thucydides,</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Greek</HI>
Hi&s;torians you mentioned, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI>
How el&s;e could they quote him?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was here &s;o utterly at a Lo&s;s, that
he could not conceal his Confu&s;ion: He held
down his Head, and continued &s;ilent; while the
Beau, who had li&s;tened to the latter Part of their
Di&s;cour&s;e; exerted his &s;uppo&s;ed Talent of
Raillery again&s;t the unhappy Admirer of the
antient Authors; and increa&s;ed his Confu&s;ion
by a thou&s;and Sarca&s;ms, which gave more Di|ver&s;ion

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains &s;ome excellent Rules for
Raillery.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had too much Polite|ne&s;s
and Good nature to in&s;i&s;t too long
upon the Ridicule in the Character of his Ac|quaintance,
changed the Di&s;cour&s;e: And <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
who had ob&s;erved, with &s;ome Concern,
the ill-judged Raillery of the young Beau, took
Occa&s;ion to decry that Species of Wit; and
gave it as her Opinion, that it was very dan|gerous
and unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>For, truly, &s;aid &s;he, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to u&s;e it without being hated or feared: and
whoever gets a Habit of it, is in Danger of
wronging all the Laws of Friend&s;hip and Hu|manity.</P>
<P>Certainly, pur&s;ued &s;he, looking at the Beau,
it is extremely unju&s;t to railly one's Friends, and
particular Acquaintance: Fir&s;t, choo&s;e them well,
and be as nice as you plea&s;e in the Choice; but
when you have cho&s;en them, by no means play
upon them: 'Tis cruel and malicious, to di|vert
one's &s;elf at the Expence of one's Friend.</P>
<P>However, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was charmed to hear her talk &s;o rationally, you
may give People Leave to railly their Ene|mies.</P>
<P>Truly, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> I cannot allow
that, any more than upon Friends; for Raillery
is the poore&s;t kind of Revenge that can be taken:
<PB N="144" REF="146">
Methinks, it is mean to railly Per&s;ons who
have a &s;mall Share of Merit; &s;ince, haply, their
Defects were born with them, and not of their
own acquiring; and it is great Inju&s;tice to de&s;|cant
upon one &s;light Fault in Men of Parts, to
the Prejudice of a thou&s;and good Qualities.</P>
<P>For aught I &s;ee, Madam, &s;aid the Beau, you
will not allow one to railly any body.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
there are very few proper Objects for Raillery;
and &s;till fewer, who can railly well: The Ta|lent
of Raillery ought to be born with a Per|&s;on;
no Art can infu&s;e it; and tho&s;e who en|deavour
to railly in &s;pite of Nature, will be &s;o
far from diverting others, that they will become
the Objects of Ridicule them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Many other plea&s;ing Qualities of Wit may
be acquired by Pains and Study, but Raillery
mu&s;t be the Gift of Nature: It is not enough
to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts;
but there mu&s;t be &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion, as mu&s;t
convey their full Force and Meaning; the
Air the A&s;pect, the Tone of the Voice, and
every Part in general, mu&s;t contribute to its
Perfection.</P>
<P>There ought al&s;o to be a great Di&s;tance be|tween
Raillery and Satire, &s;o that one may ne|ver
be mi&s;taken for the other: Raillery ought
indeed to &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;en&s;ibly touch, tho&s;e to
whom it is directed; but I would not have the
Wounds it makes, either deep or la&s;ting: Let
tho&s;e who feel it, be hurt like Per&s;ons, who,
gathering Ro&s;es, are pricked by the Thorns,
and find a &s;weet Smoll to make amends.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
I would have Raillery rai&s;e the Fancy, and
quicken the Imagination, the Fire of its Wit
&s;hould only enable us to trace its Original,
and &s;hine as the Stars do, but not burn.
Yet, after all, I cannot greatly approve of
Raillery, or cea&s;e to think it dangerous; and,
to pur&s;ue my Compari&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, with an
inchanting Smile, Per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s the
true Talent of Raillery, are like Comets; they
are &s;eldom &s;een, and are at once admir'd and
fear'd.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
had li&s;ten'd to her with many Signs of Admi|ration,
you &s;peak like an Orator.</P>
<P>One would not imagine, interrupted Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;aw <HI>Arabella</HI> in &s;ome Confu&s;ion
at the coar&s;e Prai&s;e her Uncle gave her, that
my Cou&s;in could &s;peak &s;o accurately of a Qua|lity
&s;he never practi&s;es: And 'tis ea&s;y to judge
by what &s;he has &s;aid, that no body can railly
finer than her&s;elf, if &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> tho' he bore her a Grudge for
knowing more Hi&s;tory than he did, yet a&s;&s;ur'd
her, that &s;he had given the be&s;t Rules imagin|able
for raillying well. But the Beau, whom
&s;he had &s;ilenc'd by her Reproof, was extremely
angry; and, &s;uppo&s;ing it would mortify her to
&s;ee him pay Court to her Cou&s;in, he redoubled
his A&s;&s;iduities to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was highly

was form'd on the Manners of the Heroines,
order'd the Woman to make her a Robe after
the &s;ame Model as the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Mantua-maker, who thought it might
do her great Prejudice with her new Cu&s;tomer,
to acknowledge &s;he knew nothing of the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Julia,</HI> or the Fa&s;hion of her Gown, replied
at Random, and with great Pertne&s;s,</P>
<P>That, that Ta&s;te was quite out; and, &s;he
would advi&s;e her Lady&s;hip to have her Cloaths
made in the pre&s;ent Mode, which was far more
becoming.</P>
<P>You can never per&s;uade me, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that any Fa&s;hion can be more becoming than
that of the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia</HI>'s, who was the mo&s;t
gallant Prince&s;s upon Earth, and knew better
than any other, how to &s;et off her Charms.
It may indeed be a little ob&s;elete now, pur&s;ued
<PB N="147" REF="149">
&s;he, for the Fa&s;hion could not but alter a little
in the Compa&s;s of near two thou&s;and Years.</P>
<P>Two thou&s;and Years! Madam, &s;aid the Wo|man,
in a great Surprize; Lord help us Trades-people,
if they did not alter a thou&s;and Times
in as many Days! I thought your Lady&s;hip
was &s;peaking of the la&s;t Month's Ta&s;te; which,
as I &s;aid before, is quite out now.</P>
<P>Well, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> let the pre&s;ent Mode
be what it will, I in&s;i&s;t upon having my Cloaths
made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daugh|ter
of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> being convinced, that none
other can be half &s;o becoming.</P>
<P>What Fa&s;hion was that, pray, Madam, &s;aid
the Woman? I never &s;aw it.</P>
<P>How, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> Have you already for|got
the Fa&s;hion of the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia</HI>'s Robe,
which you &s;aid was wore but la&s;t Month? Or,
are you ignorant that the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia,</HI> and
the Daughter of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> is the &s;ame Per&s;on?</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Madam, &s;aid the Woman, ex|tremely
confus'd, I had forgot that, till you
called it to my Mind.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> make me a Robe in the
&s;ame Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Mantua-maker was now wholly at a
Lo&s;s in what Manner to behave; for, being
con&s;cious that &s;he knew nothing of the Prince&s;s
<HI>Julia</HI>'s Fa&s;hion, &s;he could not undertake to
make it without Directions; and &s;he was afraid
of di&s;covering her Ignorance by asking for any;
&s;o that her Silence and Embarra&s;&s;ment per&s;ua|ding
<HI>Arabella</HI> &s;he knew nothing of the Matter,
&s;he di&s;mi&s;t her with a &s;mall Pre&s;ent, for the
Trouble &s;he had given her, and had Recour&s;e
<PB N="148" REF="150">
to her u&s;ual Expedient, which was, to make
one of her Women, who under&s;tood a little of
the Mantua-making Bu&s;ine&s;s, make a Robe for
her, after her own Directions.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who imagin'd &s;he had &s;ent
for Work-women, in order to have Cloaths
made in the modern Ta&s;te, was &s;urpriz'd at her
Entrance into her Chamber, to &s;ee her dre&s;&s;ing
for the Ball, in a Habit &s;ingular to the la&s;t
Degree.</P>
<P>She wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver
Stuff of her Robe, was only kept by its own
Richne&s;s, from hanging clo&s;e about her. It
was quite open round her Brea&s;t, which was
&s;haded with a rich Border of Lace; and cla&s;p|ing
clo&s;e to her Wai&s;t, by &s;mall Knots of Dia|monds,
de&s;cended in a &s;weeping Train on the
Ground.</P>
<P>The Sleeves were &s;hort, wide, and &s;la&s;h'd,
fa&s;tned in different Places with Diamonds, and
her Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls
of Ruffles. Her Hair, which fell in very ea&s;y
Ringlets on her Neck, was plac'd with great
Care and Exactne&s;s round her lovely Face; and
the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her
Head-dre&s;s, di&s;pos'd to the greate&s;t Advantage.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, nothing could be more &s;in|gularly
becoming than her Dre&s;s; or &s;et off
with greater Advantage the &s;triking Beauties of
her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' &s;he was not di&s;pleas'd to
&s;ee her per&s;i&s;t in her Singularity of Dre&s;s; yet
could not behold her look &s;o lovely in it, with|out
feeling a &s;ecret Unea&s;ine&s;s; but con&s;oling
her&s;elf with the Hopes of the Ridicule &s;he
<PB N="149" REF="151">
would occa&s;ion, &s;he a&s;&s;um'd a chearful Air,
approv'd her Ta&s;te in the Choice of her Co|lours,
and went with her at the u&s;ual Hour,
to the Rooms, attended by Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> and the young Beau we have for|merly
mention'd.</P>
<P>The Surprize <HI>Arabella</HI>'s unu&s;ual Appearance
gave to the whole Company, was very vi&s;ible
to every one but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Moment &s;he enter'd the Room, every
one whi&s;per'd the Per&s;on next to them; and for
&s;ome Moments, nothing was heard but the
Words, the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia;</HI> which was eccho'd
at every Corner, and at la&s;t attracted her Ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Company
with her, were in &s;ome Confu&s;ion at the uni|ver&s;al
Exclamation, which they imagin'd was
occa&s;ion'd by the Singularity of her Habit;
tho' they could not conceive, why they gave
her that Title. Had they known the Adven|ture
of the Mantua-maker, it would doubtle&s;s
have ea&s;ily occurr'd to them; for the Woman
had no &s;ooner left <HI>Arabella,</HI> than &s;he related
the Conference &s;he had with a Lady newly ar|riv'd,
who had requir'd her to make a Robe in
the Manner of the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia</HI>'s; and di&s;|mi&s;s'd
her, becau&s;e &s;he did not under&s;tand the
Fa&s;hions that prevail'd two thou&s;and Years ago.</P>
<P>This Story was quickly di&s;pers'd, and for its
Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diver&s;ion;
every one long'd to &s;ee a Fa&s;hion of &s;uch An|tiquity;
and expected the Appearance of the
Prince&s;s <HI>Julia</HI> with great Impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">
It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was
trea&s;ur'd up for her Appearance; and the occa|&s;ional
Humouri&s;t had already prepared his ac|cu&s;tom'd
Je&s;t, when the Sight of the devoted
fair One repell'd his Vivacity, and the de&s;ign'd
Ridicule of the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Scarce had the fir&s;t tumultous Whi&s;per e&s;cap'd
the Lips of each Individual, when they found
them&s;elves aw'd to Re&s;pect by that irre&s;i&s;table
Charm in the Per&s;on of <HI>Arabella,</HI> which com|manded
Reverence and Love from all who be|held
her.</P>
<P>Her noble Air, the native Dignity in her
Looks, the inexpre&s;&s;ible Grace which accom|pany'd
all her Motions, and the con&s;ummate
Loveline&s;s of her Form, drew the Admiration
of the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectful Silence &s;ucceeded, and the A&s;to|ni&s;hment
her Beauty occa&s;ion'd, left them no
Room to de&s;cant on the Ab&s;urdity of her Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who felt a malicious Joy at
the Sneers &s;he expected would be ca&s;t on her
Cou&s;in, was greatly di&s;appointed at the Defer|ence
which &s;eem'd to be paid her; and to vent
&s;ome Part of her Spleen, took occa&s;ion to men|tion
her Surprize, at the Behaviour of the
Company on their Entrance; wondering what
they could mean by whi&s;pering the Prince&s;s
<HI>Julia</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling, I am not
le&s;s &s;urpriz'd than you at it; and &s;ince they di|rected
their Looks to me at the &s;ame Time, I
fancy they either took me for &s;ome Prince&s;s of
the Name of <HI>Julia,</HI> who is expected here to-Night,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
or el&s;e flatter me with &s;ome Re&s;em|blance
to the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>The Compari&s;on, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
who took all Occa&s;ions to &s;hew his Reading, is
too injurious to you, for I am of Opinion you
as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beau|ties
of your Per&s;on, as you do in the Qualities
of your Mind.</P>
<P>I never heard Licentiou&s;ne&s;s imputed to the
Daughter of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI>
and the mo&s;t her Enemies can &s;ay of her, is,
that &s;he loved Admiration, and would permit
her&s;elf to be beloved, and to be told &s;o, with|out
&s;hewing any Signs of Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
how &s;trangely do you mi&s;take the Character of
<HI>Julia:</HI> Tho' the Daughter of an Emperor,
&s;he was, pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t aban|don'd
Pro&s;titute in <HI>Rome;</HI> many of her Intrigues
are recorded in Hi&s;tory; but to mention only
one, Was not her infamous Commerce with
<HI>Ovid,</HI> the Cau&s;e of his Bani&s;hment?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Some Reflexions very fit, and others very
unfit for an A&s;&s;embly-Room.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOU &s;peak in &s;trange Terms, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
blu&s;hing, of a Prince&s;s, who if &s;he
was not the mo&s;t re&s;erv'd and &s;evere Per&s;on in
the World, was yet neverthele&s;s, ab&s;olutely
cha&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154">
I know there were People who repre&s;ented
her Partiality for <HI>Ovid</HI> in a very unfavourable
Light; but that ingenious Poet, when he re|lated
his Hi&s;tory to the great <HI>Agrippa,</HI> told him
in Confidence all that had pa&s;s'd between him
and the Prince&s;s <HI>Julia,</HI> than which nothing
could be more innocent tho' a little indi&s;creet.
For, 'tis certain that &s;he permitted him to love
her, and did not condemn him to any rigorous
Puni&s;hment for daring to tell her &s;o; yet, for
all this, as I &s;aid before, tho' &s;he was not alto|gether
&s;o au&s;tere as &s;he ought to have been, yet
&s;he was neverthele&s;s a mo&s;t virtuous Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> not daring to contradict a Lady
who&s;e exten&s;ive Reading had furni&s;h'd her with
Anecdotes unknown almo&s;t to any Body el&s;e,
by his Silence confe&s;s'd her Superiority. But
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew all the&s;e Anecdotes
were drawn from Romances, which he found
contradicted the known Facts in Hi&s;tory, and
a&s;&s;ign'd the mo&s;t ridiculous Cau&s;es for Things
of the greate&s;t Importance; could not help
&s;miling at the Facility with which Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
gave into tho&s;e idle Ab&s;urdities. For notwith|&s;tanding
his Affectation of great Reading, his
&s;uperficial Knowledge of Hi&s;tory made it ex|tremely
ea&s;y to deceive him; and as it was his
Cu&s;tom to mark in his Pocket-Book all the
Scraps of Hi&s;tory he heard introduced into Con|ver&s;ation,
and retail them again in other Com|pany;
he did not doubt but he would make a
Figure with the curious Circum&s;tances <HI>Arabella</HI>
had furni&s;h'd him with.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> ob&s;erving Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> by his familiar
Bows, &s;ignificant Smiles, and ea&s;y Salutations,
<PB N="153" REF="155">
was acquainted with the greate&s;t Part of the
A&s;&s;embly, told him, that &s;he did not doubt but
he knew the Adventures of many Per&s;ons whom
they were viewing; and that he would do her
a Plea&s;ure, if he would relate &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was charm'd with a Reque&s;t which
afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a fa|vourite
Inclination, and &s;eating him&s;elf near
her immediately, was beginning to obey her
Injunctions, when &s;he gracefully intreated him
to &s;tay a Moment; and calling to Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
and his Si&s;ter, who were talking to Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
ask'd them if they cho&s;e to partake of a more
rational Amu&s;ement than Dancing, and li&s;ten
to the Adventures of &s;ome illu&s;trious Per&s;ons,
which Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> had promis'd to relate.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
&s;miling, you will find that a le&s;s innocent
Amu&s;ement than Dancing.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;ince it is not
an indi&s;creet Curio&s;ity which prompts me to a
De&s;ire of hearing the Hi&s;tories Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> has
promis'd to entertain me with; but rather a
Hope of hearing &s;omething which may at once
improve and delight me; &s;omething which
may excite my Admiration, engage my E&s;teem,
or influence my Practice.</P>
<P>'Twas doubtle&s;s, with &s;uch Motives as the&s;e,
that we find Prince&s;&s;es and Ladies of the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious Rank, in <HI>Clelia</HI> and the Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
li&s;tning to the Adventures of Per&s;ons, in whom
they were probably as little intere&s;ted, as we
are in the&s;e around us. Kings, Princes, and
Commanders of Armies, thought it was no
Wa&s;te of their Time, in the mid&s;t of the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Hurry and Clamour of a Camp, to li&s;ten many
Hours to the Relation of one &s;ingle Hi&s;tory,
and not fill'd with any extraordinary Events;
but haply a &s;imple Recital of common Occur|rences:
The great <HI>Cyrus,</HI> while he was bu&s;y
in reducing all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to his Yoke, heard never|thele&s;s,
the Hi&s;tories of all the con&s;iderable Per|&s;ons
in the Camp, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Strangers,
and even his Enemies. If there was therefore
any thing either criminal or mean, in hearing
the Adventures of others, do you imagine &s;o
many great and illu&s;trious Per&s;ons would have
given in to &s;uch an Amu&s;ement?</P>
<P>After this <HI>Arabella</HI> turn'd gravely about to
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> and told him, he was at Liberty to
begin his Recital.</P>
<P>The Beau, a little di&s;concerted by the So|lemnity
with which &s;he reque&s;ted his Informa|tion,
knew not how to begin with the Forma|lity
that he &s;aw was required of him; and
therefore fat &s;ilent for a few Moments; which
<HI>Arabella</HI> &s;uppos'd was to recall to his Memory
all the Pa&s;&s;ages he propos'd to relate.</P>
<P>His Perplexity would probably have increas'd
in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening by the profound Silence
which &s;he ob&s;erved, had not Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
&s;eated her&s;elf with a &s;prightly Air on the other
Side of him, and directing his Eyes to a tall
hand&s;ome Woman that had ju&s;t enter'd, ask'd
him plea&s;antly, to tell her Hi&s;tory if he knew it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> brought into his u&s;ual Track by
this Que&s;tion, an&s;wer'd &s;miling, That the Hi|&s;tory
of that Lady was yet a Secret, or known
but to very few; but my Intelligence, added
<PB N="155" REF="157">
he, is generally the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">, and may always
be depended on.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lady is one of your
Acquaintances, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> you with the Re|cital
of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> from her own Mouth.</P>
<P>No, really, Madam, an&s;wer'd Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI>
&s;urpriz'd at the great Simplicity of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
for &s;o he under&s;tood it; the Lady, I believe, is
not &s;o communicative: And to &s;ay the Truth,
I &s;hould not chu&s;e to hear her Adventures from
her&s;elf, &s;ince &s;he certainly would &s;uppre&s;s the
mo&s;t material Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In a Word, &s;aid he, lowering his Voice,
That Lady was for many Years the Mi&s;tre&s;s of
a young military Nobleman, whom &s;he was &s;o
complai&s;ant to follow in all his Campaigns,
Marches, Sieges, and every Inconveniency of
War: He married her in <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> from
whence he is lately arriv'd, and introduc'd his
new Lady to his noble Brother, by whom &s;he
was not unfavourably receiv'd. 'Tis worth
remarking, that this &s;ame haughty Peer thought
&s;it to re&s;ent with implacable Ob&s;tinacy, the
Marriage of another of his Brothers, with the
Widow of a brave Officer, of con&s;iderable
Rank in the Army. 'Tis true, &s;he was &s;everal
Years older than the young Lord, and had no
Fortune; but the Duke a&s;&s;ign'd other Rea&s;ons
for his Di&s;plea&s;ure: He complain'd loudly, that
his Brother had di&s;honour'd the Nobility of his
Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his Re|&s;entment
till the Death of the young Hero, who
gave many remarkable Proofs of his Courage
and Fortitude upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, and died
gloriou&s;ly before the Walls of <HI>Carthagena;</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="158">
leaving his di&s;con&s;olate Lady a Widow a &s;e|cond
Time, with the Acqui&s;ition of a Title
indeed, but a very &s;mall Addition to her For|tune.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that gay, &s;plendid Lady, I be&s;eech
you, Madam, pur&s;ued he, turning to <HI>Arabella;</HI>
how affectedly &s;he looks and talks, and throws
her Eyes around the Room, with a haughty
Self-&s;ufficiency in her A&s;pect, and in&s;olent Con|tempt
for every Thing but her&s;elf. Her Ha|bit,
her Speech, her Motions, are all <HI>French;</HI>
nothing in <HI>England</HI> is able to plea&s;e her; the
People &s;o dull, &s;o aukwardly polite, the Man|ners
&s;o gro&s;s; no Delicacy, no Elegance, no
Magnificence in their Per&s;ons, Hou&s;es, or Di|ver&s;ions;
every Thing is &s;o di&s;ta&s;teful, there
is no living in &s;uch a Place. One may crawl
about, indeed, &s;he &s;ays, and make a &s;hift to
breathe in the odious Country, but one cannot
be &s;aid to live; and with all the Requi&s;ites to
render Life delightful, here, one can only &s;uffer,
not enjoy it.</P>
<P>Would one not imagine, pur&s;ued he, this
fine Lady was a Per&s;on of very exalted Rank,
who has the Sanction of Birth, Riches, and
Grandeur for her extraordinary Pride; and yet
&s;he is no other than the Daughter of an Inn-Keeper
at <HI>Spa,</HI> and had the exalted Po&s;t a&s;&s;ign'd
her of attending new Lodgers to their Apart|ments,
acquainting them with all the Conve|niences
of the Place, an&s;wering an humble
Que&s;tion or two concerning what Company
was in the Town, what Scandal was &s;tirring,
and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159">
One of our great Sea Commanders going
thither for his Health, happen'd to lodge at this
Inn; and was &s;o &s;truck with her Charms, that
he marry'd her in a few Weeks, and &s;oon after
brought her to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Origin of this fanta&s;tick Lady;
who&s;e in&s;upportable Pride and ridiculous Af|fectation,
draws Contempt and Aver&s;ion where|&s;he
appears.</P>
<P>Did I not tell you, Madam, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that the Amu&s;ement you had
cho&s;e was not &s;o innocent as Dancing? What a
deal of Scandal has Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> utter'd in the
Compa&s;s of a few Minutes?</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I know not
what to make of the Hi&s;tories he has been re|lating.
I think they do not de&s;erve that Name,
and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on
particular Per&s;ons, than a &s;erious Relation of
Facts. I confe&s;s my Expectations from this
Gentleman have not been an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>I think, however, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
we may allow that there is a negative
Merit in the Relations Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> has made;
for, if he has not &s;hewn us any Thing to ap|prove,
he has at lea&s;t &s;hewn us what to condemn.</P>
<P>The Ugline&s;s of Vice, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI>
ought only to be repre&s;ented to the Vicious;
to whom Satire, like a magnifying Gla&s;s, may
aggravate every Defect, in order to make its
Deformity appear more hideous; but &s;ince its
End is only to reprove and amend, it &s;hould
never be addre&s;s'd to any but tho&s;e who come
within its Correction, and may be the better
for it: A virtuous Mind need not be &s;hewn
<PB N="158" REF="160">
the Deformity of Vice, to make it be hated and
avoided; the more pure and uncorrupted our
Ideas are, the le&s;s &s;hall we be in&s;luenc'd by Ex|ample.
A natural Propen&s;ity to Virtue or
Vice often determines the Choice: 'Tis &s;uffi|cient
therefore to &s;hew a good Mind what it
ought to pur&s;ue, though a bad one mu&s;t be told
what to avoid. In a Word, one ought to be
always incited, the other always re&s;train'd.</P>
<P>I vow, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you'd make one think one came here to hear a
Sermon; you are &s;o very grave, and talk upon
&s;uch high-flown Subjects. What Harm was
there in what Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was telling us? It
would be hard indeed, if one might not divert
one's &s;elf with other Peoples Faults.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho&s;e who
can divert them&s;elves with the Faults of others,
are not behind hand in affording Diver&s;ion.
And that very Inclination, added &s;he, &s;milingly,
to hear other Peoples Faults, may by tho&s;e very
People, be condemned as one, and afford them
the &s;ame Kind of ill-natur'd Plea&s;ure you are
&s;o de&s;irous of.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, return'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> your
Lady&s;hip was the fir&s;t who introduc'd the Di&s;|cour&s;e
you condemn &s;o much. Did not you
de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> to tell you Hi&s;tories about the

come and hear them?</P>
<P>'Tis true, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I did de&s;ire
you to partake with me of a plea&s;ing and
rational Amu&s;ement, for &s;uch I imagin'd
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI>'s Hi&s;tories might afford; far from a
Detail of Vices, Follies, and Irregularities, I
<PB N="159" REF="161">
expected to have heard the Adventures of &s;ome
illu&s;trious Per&s;onages related; between who&s;e
Actions, and tho&s;e of the Heroes and Heroines
of Antiquity, I might have found &s;ome Re|&s;emblance.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, I hop'd to have heard imitated
the &s;ublime Courage of a <HI>Clelia,</HI> who, to &s;ave
her Honour from the Attempts of the impious
<HI>Tarquin,</HI> leap'd into the River <HI>Tyber,</HI> and &s;wam
to the other Side; or the noble Re&s;olution of
the incomparable <HI>Candace,</HI> who, to e&s;cape out
of the Hands of her Ravi&s;her, the Pirate <HI>Ze|nadorus,</HI>
&s;et Fire to his Ve&s;&s;el with her own
Hands, and committed her&s;elf to the Mercy of
the Waves: Or, the Con&s;tancy and Affection
of a <HI>Mandana,</HI> who, for the Sake of a <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
refu&s;ed the riche&s;t Crowns in the World, and
braved the Terrors of Death to pre&s;erve her&s;elf

<P>As for the Men, I hoped to have heard of

<HI>Juba,</HI> the renowned <HI>Alcamenes,</HI> and many
thou&s;and Heroes of Antiquity; who&s;e glorious
Exploits in War, aud un&s;aken Con&s;tancy in
Love, have given them an immortal Fame.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was uttering this long Speech,
with great Emotion, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a &s;ly
Look at the Beau, gave him to under&s;tand,
that was her Cou&s;in's Foible.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> however, not able to compre|hend

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being a Chapter of the Satyrical Kind.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT their Return, Sir <HI>Charles</HI> told his Niece,
That &s;he had now had a Specimen of the
World, and &s;ome of the fa&s;hionable Amu&s;e|ments;
and ask'd her, how &s;he had been en|tertain'd.</P>
<P>Why, truly, Sir, replied &s;he, &s;miling, I
have brought away no great Reli&s;h for a Re|newal
of the Amu&s;ement I have partaken of
To-night. If the World, in which you &s;eem
to think I am but new initiated, affords only
the&s;e Kinds of Plea&s;ures, I &s;hall very &s;oon regret
the Solitude and Books I have quitted.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">
Why pray, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville?</HI> What Kind
of Amu&s;ements did your Lady&s;hip expect to
find in the World? And what was there di&s;|agreeable
in your Entertainment to Night? I
am &s;ure there is no Place in <HI>England,</HI> except
<HI>London,</HI> where there is &s;o much good Company
to be met with, as here. The A&s;&s;embly was
very numerous and brillant, and one can be at
no Lo&s;s for Amu&s;ements: The Pump-Room in
the Morning, the Parade, and the Rooms, in
the Evening, with little occa&s;ional Parties of
Plea&s;ure, will find one &s;ufficient Employment,
and leave none of one's Time to lye u&s;ele&s;s up|on
one's Hand.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that
one's Time is far from being well employ'd in
the Manner you portion it out: And People
who &s;pend theirs in &s;uch trifling Amu&s;ements,
mu&s;t certainly live to very little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>What room, I pray you, does a Lady give
for high and noble Adventures, who con&s;umes
her Days in Dre&s;&s;ing, Dancing, li&s;tening to
Songs, and ranging the Walks with People as
thoughtle&s;s as her&s;elf? How mean and con|temptible
a Figure mu&s;t a Life &s;pent in &s;uch idle
Amu&s;ements make in Hi&s;tory? Or rather, Are
not &s;uch Per&s;ons always buried in Oblivion,
and can any Pen be found who would conde|&s;cend
to record &s;uch incon&s;iderable Actions?</P>
<P>Nor can I per&s;uade my&s;elf, added &s;he, that
any of tho&s;e Men whom I &s;aw at the A&s;&s;embly,
with Figures &s;o feminine, Voices &s;o &s;oft, &s;uch
tripping Steps, and unmeaning Ge&s;tures, have
ever &s;ignalized either their Courage or Con|&s;tancy;
<PB N="162" REF="164">
but might be overcome by their Enemy
in Battle, or be fal&s;e to their Mi&s;tre&s;s in Love.</P>
<P>Law! Cou&s;in, reply'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
are always talking of Battles and Fighting. Do
you expect that Per&s;ons of Quality, and fine
Gentlemen, will go to the Wars? What Bu|&s;ine&s;s
have they to fight? That belongs to the
Officers.</P>
<P>Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> and &s;ome other Title ought to
be found out for Men who do nothing but
Dance and Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>I could never have imagined, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> &s;urveying <HI>Arabella,</HI> that a Lady &s;o
elegant and gay in her own Appearance, &s;hould
have an Aver&s;ion to Plea&s;ure and Magnificence.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I have
an Aver&s;ion to neither: On the contrary, I
am a great Admirer of both. But my Ideas
of Amu&s;ements and Grandeur are probably
different from yours.</P>
<P>I will allow the Ladies to be &s;ollicitous about
their Habits, and dre&s;s with all the Care and
Elegance they are capable of; but &s;uch Trifles
are below the Con&s;ideration of a Man, who
ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appear|ance
to the Embroidery on his Coat, but to
his high and noble Air, the Grandeur of his
Courage, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and
the many heroick Actions he has perform'd.</P>
<P>Such a Man will dre&s;s his Per&s;on with a
graceful Simplicity, and lavi&s;h all his Gold and
Embroidery upon his Armour, to render him
con&s;picuous in the Day of Battle. The Plumes
in his Helmet will look more graceful in the
<PB N="163" REF="165">
Field, than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball;
and Jewels blaze with more Propriety on his
Shield and Cuira&s;s in Battle, than glittering on
his Finger in a Dance.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, however, pur&s;ued &s;he, that
I ab&s;olutely condemn Dancing, and think it a
Diver&s;ion wholly unworthy of a Hero.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory has recorded &s;ome very famous Balls,
at which the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Per&s;ons in the
World have appear'd.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> the Great, we are inform'd, open'd a
Ball with the divine <HI>Mandana</HI> at <HI>Sardis.</HI> The
renown'd King of <HI>Scythia</HI> danc'd with the
Prince&s;s <HI>Cleopatra</HI> at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The brave
<HI>Cleomedon</HI> with the fair <HI>Candace</HI> at <HI>Ethiopia;</HI>
but the&s;e Diver&s;ions were taken but &s;eldom,
and con&s;ider'd indeed as an Amu&s;ement, not as
a Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life.</P>
<P>How would &s;o many glorious Battles have
been fought, Cities taken, Ladies re&s;cu'd, and
other great and noble Adventures been atchiev'd,
if the Men, &s;unk in Sloth and Effeminacy, had
continually follow'd the Sound of a Fiddle,
&s;aunter'd in Publick Walks, and tattled over a
Tea-table.</P>
<P>I vow, Cou&s;in, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are
infinitely more &s;evere in your Cen&s;ures than
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was at the A&s;&s;embly. You had lit|tle
Rea&s;on methinks to be angry with him.</P>
<P>All I have &s;aid, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> were the
natural Inference from your own Account of
the Manner in which People live here. When
Actions are a Cen&s;ure upon them&s;elves, the Re|citer
will always be con&s;ider'd as a Satiri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine ju&s;tifies her own
Notions by &s;ome very illu&s;trious Ex|amples.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Selvin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> who had li&s;ten'd
attentively to this Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
took Leave as &s;oon as it was ended,
and went away with very different Opinions
of her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> declaring &s;he was a Fool, and had
no Knowledge of the World, and Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
convinc'd &s;he was a Wit, and very learn'd in
Antiquity.</P>
<P>Certainly, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> in Support of his
Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment; has
been capable of prodigious Application, as is
apparent by her exten&s;ive Reading: Then her
Memory is quite miraculous. I prote&s;t, I am
quite charm'd with her: I never met with
&s;uch a Woman in my Life.</P>
<P>Her Cou&s;in, in my Opinion, reply'd Mr.
<HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> is infinitely beyond her in every Merit,
but Beauty. How &s;prightly and free her Con|ver&s;ation?
What a thorough Knowledge of
the World? So true a Ta&s;te for polite Amu&s;e|ments,
and a Fund of Spirits that &s;ets Vapours
and Spleen at Defiance.</P>
<P>This Speech bringing on a Compari&s;on be|tween
the Ladies, the Champions for each grew
&s;o warm in the Di&s;pute, that they had like to
have quarrell'd. However, by the Interpo&s;ition
<PB N="165" REF="167">
of &s;ome other Gentlemen who were with them,
they parted tolerable Friends that Night, and
renew'd their Vi&s;its to Sir <HI>Charles</HI> in the Morn|ing.</P>
<P>They found only Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> with her
Father and Brother. <HI>Arabella</HI> generally &s;pent
the Mornings in her own Chamber, where
Reading and the Labours of the Toilet em|ploy'd
her Time till Dinner: Tho' it mu&s;t be
confe&s;s'd to her Honour, that the latter en|gro&s;s'd
but a very &s;mall Part of it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> with whom the Beau had a
long Conver&s;ation at one of the Windows;
in which he recounted his Di&s;pute with Mr.
<HI>Selvin,</HI> and the Danger he ran of being pink'd
in a Duel, that was his Phra&s;e, for her Sake,
at la&s;t propos'd a Walk; to which &s;he con|&s;ented,
and engag'd to prevail upon <HI>Arabella</HI> to
accompany them.</P>
<P>That Lady at fir&s;t po&s;itively refus'd; al|leging
in Excu&s;e, That &s;he was &s;o extremely
intere&s;ted in the Fate of the Prince&s;s <HI>Meli&s;intha,</HI>
who&s;e Story &s;he was reading, that &s;he could not
&s;tir till &s;he had fini&s;h'd it.</P>
<P>That poor Prince&s;s, continu'd &s;he, is at pre|&s;ent
in a mo&s;t terrible Situation. She has ju&s;t
&s;et Fire to the Palace, in order to avoid the
Embraces of a King who forc'd her to marry
him. I am in Pain to know how &s;he e&s;capes
the Flames.</P>
<P>P&s;haw, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> let her
peri&s;h there, if &s;he will: Don't let her hinder
our Walk.</P>
<P>Who is it you doom with &s;o much Cruelty
to peri&s;h, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> clo&s;ing the Book, and
<PB N="166" REF="168">
looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on her Cou&s;in? Is it the beau|tiful
<HI>Meli&s;intha,</HI> that Prince&s;s, who&s;e Fortitude
and Patience have ju&s;tly render'd her the Admi|ration
of the whole World? That Prince&s;s,
de&s;cended from a Race of Heroes, who&s;e he|roick
Virtues all glow'd in her own beauteous
Brea&s;t; that Prince&s;s, who, when taken Cap|tive
with the King her Father, bore her Im|pri&s;onment
and Chains with a marvellous Con|&s;tancy;
and who, when &s;he en&s;laved her Con|queror,
and given Fetters to the Prince who
held her Father and her&s;elf in Bonds, nobly
refus'd the Diadem he proffer'd her, and devoted
her&s;elf to De&s;truction, in order to puni&s;h the
Enemy of her Hou&s;e. I am not able to relate
the re&s;t of her Hi&s;tory, &s;eeing I have read no
further my&s;elf; but if you will be plea&s;ed to
&s;it down and li&s;ten to me while I read what re|mains,
I am per&s;uaded you will find new Cau&s;e
to love and admire this amiable Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
have heard enough; and I could have been
very well &s;atisfy'd not to have heard &s;o much.
I think we wa&s;te a great deal of Time talking
about People we know nothing of. The Morn|ing
will be quite lo&s;t, if we don't make Ha&s;te.
Come, added &s;he, you mu&s;t go: You have a
new Lover below, who waits to go with us;
he'll die if I don't bring you.</P>
<P>A new Lover! return'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;urpriz'd.</P>
<P>Aye, aye, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> the learned
Mr. <HI>Selvin;</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, he had almo&s;t quar|rell'd
with Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> la&s;t Night about your
Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">
<HI>Arabella,</HI> at this Intelligence, ca&s;ting down
her Eyes, di&s;cover'd many Signs of Anger and
Confu&s;ion: And after a Silence of &s;ome Mo|ments,
during which, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> had been
employ'd in adju&s;ting her Dre&s;s at the Gla&s;s,
addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her Cou&s;in with an Accent
&s;omewhat le&s;s &s;weet than before.</P>
<P>Had any other than your&s;elf, Mi&s;s, &s;aid &s;he,
acquainted me with the Pre&s;umption of that
unfortunate Per&s;on, I &s;hould haply have di&s;co|ver'd
my Re&s;entment in other Terms: But, as
it is, mu&s;t inform you, that I take it extremely
ill, you &s;hould be acce&s;&s;ary to giving me this
Offence.</P>
<P>Hey day! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> turning about
ha&s;tily, How have I offended your Lady&s;hip,
pray?</P>
<P>I am willing to hope, Cou&s;in, reply'd <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
that it was only to divert your&s;elf with
the Trouble and Confu&s;ion in which you &s;ee
me, that you have indi&s;creetly told Things
which ought to have been bury'd in Silence.</P>
<P>And what is all this mighty Trouble and
Confu&s;ion about then, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;miling? Is it becau&s;e I told you,
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was a Lover of your Lady&s;hip?</P>
<P>Certainly, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uch an Information
is &s;ufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexi|ty.
Is it &s;uch a little Matter, think you, to
be told that a Man has the Pre&s;umption to love
one?</P>
<P>A meer Trifle, reply'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> laugh|ing;
a hundred Lovers are not worth a Mo|ment's
Thought, when one's &s;ure of them, for
then the Trouble is all over. And as for this
<PB N="168" REF="170">
unfortunate Per&s;on, as your Lady&s;hip called
him, let him die at his Lei&s;ure, while we go
to the Parade.</P>
<P>Your Levity, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> forces
me to &s;mile, notwith&s;tanding the Cau&s;e I have
to be incens'd; however, I have Charity enough
to make me not de&s;ire the Death of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
who may repair the Crime he has been guilty
of by Repentance and Di&s;continuation.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are re|&s;olv'd
to go to the Parade: Shall I reach you
your odd Kind of Capuchin?</P>
<P>How, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> can I with any Pro|priety
&s;ee a Man who has di&s;cover'd him&s;elf to
have a Pa&s;&s;ion for me? Will he not con&s;true
&s;uch a Favour into a Permi&s;&s;ion for him to
hope?</P>
<P>Oh! no, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> he does
not imagine I have told your Lady&s;hip he loves
you; for indeed he don't know that I am ac|quainted
with his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then he is le&s;s culpable than I thought him,
reply'd <HI>Arabella;</HI> and if you think I am in no
Danger of hearing a Confe&s;&s;ion of his Fault
from his own Mouth, I'll comply with your
Reque&s;t, and go with you to the Parade. But
added &s;he, I mu&s;t fir&s;t engage you to promi&s;e
not to leave me alone a Moment, le&s;t he &s;hould
take Advantage of &s;uch an Opportunity, to
give &s;ome Hint of his Pa&s;&s;ion, that would force
me to treat him very rigorou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> an&s;wer'd laughing, That &s;he
would be &s;ure to mind her Directions. How|ever,
&s;aid &s;he, your Lady&s;hip need not be ap|prehen&s;ive
he will &s;ay any fine Things to you;
<PB N="169" REF="171">
for I knew a young Lady he was formerly in
Love with, and the odious Creature vi&s;ited her
a Twelve-month before he found Courage
enough to tell her &s;he was hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> he was much
to be commended for his Re&s;pect. A Lover
&s;hould never have the Pre&s;umption to declare
his Pa&s;&s;ion to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, unle&s;s in certain
Circum&s;tances, which may at the &s;ame Time
in part di&s;arm her Anger. For In&s;tance, he
mu&s;t &s;truggle with the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion,
till it has ca&s;t him into a Fever. His Phy&s;i|cians
mu&s;t give him over, pronouncing his Di|&s;temper
incurable, &s;ince the Cau&s;e of it being
in his Mind, all their Art is incapable of re|moving
it. Thus he mu&s;t &s;uffer, rejoicing at
the Approach of Death, which will free him
from all his Torments, without violating the
Re&s;pect he owes to the Divine Object of his
Flame. At length, when he has but a few
Hours to live, his Mi&s;tre&s;s, with many Signs
of Compa&s;&s;ion, conjures him to tell her the
Cau&s;e of his De&s;pair. The Lover, con&s;cious
of his Crime, evades all her Inquiries; but the
Lady laying at la&s;t a peremptory Command
upon him to di&s;clo&s;e the Secret, he dares not
di&s;obey her, and acknowledges his Pa&s;&s;ion with
the utmo&s;t Contrition for having offended her;
bidding her take the &s;mall Remainder of his
Life to expiate his Crime; and fini&s;hes his
Di&s;cour&s;e by falling into a Swoon.</P>
<P>The Lady is touch'd at his Condition, com|mands
him to live, and if nece&s;&s;ary, permits
him to hope.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">
This is the mo&s;t common Way in which
&s;uch Declarations are, and ought to be brought
about. However, there are others, which are
as well calculated for &s;paring a Lady's Confu|&s;ion,
and deprecating her Wrath.</P>
<P>The Lover, for Example, like the Prince
of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;age<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> after having buried his Pa&s;|&s;ion
in Silence for many Years, may chance to
be walking with his Confidant in a retir'd
Place; to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, he
relates the Exce&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion and De&s;pair.
And while he is thus unbo&s;oming his Griefs,
not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting he is overheard, his
Prince&s;s, who had been li&s;tning to him in much
Trouble and Confu&s;ion, by &s;ome little Ru&s;tling
&s;he makes, unawares di&s;covers her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;urpriz'd Lover throws him&s;elf at her
Feet, begs Pardon for his Ra&s;hne&s;s, ob&s;erves
that he had never pre&s;um'd to di&s;cover his
Pa&s;&s;ion to her; and implores her Leave to die
before her, as a Puni&s;hment for his unde&s;ign'd
Offence.</P>
<P>The Method which the great <HI>Artamenes</HI> took
to let the Prince&s;s of <HI>Media</HI> know he adored
her, was not le&s;s re&s;pectful. This valiant Prince,
who had long loved her, being to fight a great
Battle, in which he had &s;ome &s;ecret Pre&s;ages he
&s;hould fall, which however deceiv'd him, wrote
a long Letter to the divine <HI>Mandana,</HI> wherein
he di&s;cover'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Re&s;olution his
Re&s;pect had in&s;pir'd him with, to con&s;ume in
Silence, and never pre&s;ume to di&s;clo&s;e his Love
while he lived; acquainting her, that he had
order'd that Letter not to be deliver'd to her,
till it was certainly known that he was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
Accordingly he receiv'd &s;everal Wounds in
the Fight, which brought him to the Ground,
and his Body not being found, they concluded
it was in the Enemy's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His faithful 'Squire, who had receiv'd his In|&s;tructions
before the Battle, ha&s;tens to the Prin|ce&s;s,
who, with all the Court, is mightily af|fected
at his Death.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ents her the Letter, which &s;he makes
no Scruple to receive, &s;ince the Writer is no
more. She reads it, and her whole Soul is
melted with Compa&s;&s;ion; &s;he bewails his Fate
with the mo&s;t tender and affectionate Marks of
Grief.</P>
<P>Her Confidant asks why &s;he is &s;o much af|fected,
&s;ince in all Probability, &s;he would not
have pardon'd him for loving her, had he been
alive?</P>
<P>She acknowledges the Truth of her Ob&s;erva|tion,

his Crime, his re&s;pectful Pa&s;&s;ion alone

Criminal, and in&s;inuates, that her Heart had
entertain'd an Affection for him.</P>
<P>Her Confidant trea&s;ures up this Hint, and
endeavours to con&s;ole her, but in vain, till News
is brought, that <HI>Artamenes,</HI> who had been car|ry'd
for dead out of the Field, and by a very
&s;urprizing Adventure conceal'd all this Time,
is return'd.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s is cover'd with Confu&s;ion, and
tho' glad he is alive, re&s;olves to bani&s;h him for
his Crime.</P>

Her Confidant pleads his Cau&s;e &s;o well, that
&s;he con&s;ents to &s;ee him; and, &s;ince he can no

in his Letter, humbly begging Pardon
for being &s;till alive.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, who cannot plead Ignorance
of his Pa&s;&s;ion, nor deny the Sorrow &s;he te&s;tify'd
for his Death, conde&s;cends to pardon him, and
he is al&s;o permitted to hope. In like Manner
the great Prince of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Does your Lady&s;hip con&s;ider how late it is,
interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had hitherto

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine being mi&s;taken her|&s;elf,
gives Ocea&s;ion for a great many
other Mi&s;takes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Ladies enter'd the Room,
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> with more Gaiety than u&s;ual,
advanc'd towards <HI>Arabella,</HI> who put on &s;o cold
and &s;evere a Countenance at his Approach, that
the poor Man, extreamly confus'd, drew back,
and remain'd in great Perplexity, fearing he had
offended her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Reception,
and aw'd by the becoming Maje&s;ty in her Per|&s;on,
notwith&s;tanding all his A&s;&s;urance, acco&s;ted
her with le&s;s Confidence than was his Cu&s;tom;
but <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;oftning her Looks with the mo&s;t
engaging Smiles, made an Apology for detain|ing
them &s;o long from the Parade, gave her
Hand to the Beau, as being not a &s;u&s;pected
Per&s;on, and permitted him to lead her out.
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to whom &s;he always allow'd the
Preference on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, being a little in|di&s;pos'd,
and not able to attend her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> who&s;e Vanity was greatly flat|ter'd
by the Preference <HI>Arabella</HI> gave him to
his Companion, proceeded according to his
u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, to examine her Looks and Be|haviour
with more Care; conceiving &s;uch a
Preference mu&s;t proceed from a latent Motive
which was not unfavourable for him. His
Di&s;cernment on the&s;e Occa&s;ions being very &s;ur|pri&s;ing,
<PB N="174" REF="176">
he &s;oon di&s;cover'd in the bright Eyes of
<HI>Arabella</HI> a &s;ecret Approbation of his Per&s;on,
which he endeavour'd to increa&s;e by di&s;playing
it with all the Addre&s;s he was Ma&s;ter of, and
did not fail to talk her into an Opinion of his
Wit, by ridiculing every Body that pa&s;s'd them,
and directing &s;everal &s;tudy'd Compliments to
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not &s;o agreeably en|tertain'd
by the grave Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> &s;aw the&s;e
Advances to a Gallantry with her Cou&s;in with
great Di&s;turbance: She was re&s;olved to in|terrupt
it if po&s;&s;ible, and being convinc'd
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> preferr'd <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Conver&s;ation to
hers, &s;he plotted how to pair them together,
and have the Beau to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As they walk'd a few Paces behind her Cou&s;in
and Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> &s;he was in no Danger of be|ing
over-heard; and taking Occa&s;ion to put
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in mind of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Behaviour to
him, when he acco&s;ted her; &s;he ask'd him, if
he was con&s;cious of having done any thing to
offend her?</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Madam, reply'd Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I know
not of any thing I have done to di&s;plea&s;e her.
I never fail'd, to my Knowledge, in my Re|&s;pects
towards her Lady&s;hip, for whom indeed
I have a mo&s;t profound Veneration.</P>
<P>I know &s;o much of her Temper, re&s;um'd
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> as to be certain, if &s;he has taken
it into her Head to be angry with you, &s;he will
be ten times more &s;o at your Indifference: And
if you hope for her Favour, you mu&s;t ask her
Pardon with the mo&s;t earne&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion ima|ginable.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177">
If I knew I had offended her, reply'd
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I would very willingly ask her Par|don;
but really, &s;ince I have not been guilty
of any Fault towards her Lady&s;hip, I don't
know how to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> coldly, I only
took the Liberty to give you &s;ome friendly Ad|vice,
which you may follow, or not, as you
plea&s;e. I know my Cou&s;in is angry at &s;ome|thing,
and I wi&s;h you were Friends again,

<P>I am mightily oblig'd to you, Madam, &s;aid
Mr. <HI>Selvin;</HI> and &s;ince you a&s;&s;ure me her Lady|&s;hip

<P>Well, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> we'll join
them at the End of the Parade; and to give
you an Opportunity of &s;peaking to my Cou&s;in,

<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who thought him&s;elf greatly
oblig'd to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> for her good Intentions,
tho' in reality &s;he had a View of expo&s;ing of
her Cou&s;in, as well as an Inclination to engage
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> took Courage as they turn'd, to get
on the other Side of <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom he had not
dar'd before to approach, while Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
addre&s;&s;ing a Whi&s;per of no great Importance to
her Cou&s;in, parted her from the Beau, and
&s;lackning her Pace a little, fell into a particular
Di&s;cour&s;e with him, which <HI>Arabella</HI> being too
polite to interrupt, remain'd in a very perplex|ing
Situation, dreading every Moment that
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> would explain him&s;elf. Alarm'd at
his Silence, yet re&s;olv'd to interrupt him if he
began to &s;peak, and afraid of beginning a Con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="176" REF="178">
fir&s;t, le&s;t he &s;hould con&s;true it to his
Advantage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> being naturally timid in the Com|pany
of Ladies, the Circum&s;tance of Di&s;grace
which he was in with <HI>Arabella,</HI> her Silence and
Re&s;erve &s;o added to his accu&s;tom'd Diffidence,
that tho' he endeavour'd &s;everal times to &s;peak,
he was not able to bring out any thing but a
preluding Hem; which he ob&s;erv'd, to his ex|treme
Confu&s;ion, &s;eem'd always to encrea&s;e
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Con&s;traint.</P>
<P>Indeed, that Lady, upon any Su&s;picion that
he was going to break his my&s;terious Silence,
always contracted her Brow into a Frown, ca&s;t
down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity, en|deavour'd
to hide her Blu&s;hes with her Fan;
and to &s;hew her In-attention, directed her Looks
to the contrary Side.</P>
<P>The Lady and Gentleman being in equal
Confu&s;ion, no Advances were made on either
Side towards a Conver&s;ation, and they had
reach'd almo&s;t the End of the Parade in an un|interrupted
Silence; when Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> fearing he
&s;hould never again have &s;o good an Opportu|nity
of making his Peace, collected all his Re|&s;olution,
and with an Accent trembling under
the Importance of the Speech he was going to
make, began,</P>
<P>Madam, Since I have had the Honour of
walking with your Lady&s;hip, I have ob&s;erved
&s;o many Signs of Con&s;traint in your Manner,
that I hardly dare intreat you to grant me a
Moment's Hearing while I&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> before you go any
further, I mu&s;t inform you, that what you are
<PB N="177" REF="179">
going to &s;ay will mortally offend me. Take
heed then how you commit an Indi&s;cretion
which will force me to treat you very rigorou&s;ly.</P>
<P>If your Lady&s;hip will not allow me to &s;peak
in my own Ju&s;tification, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> yet I
hope you will not refu&s;e to tell me my Offence,
&s;ince I&mdash;</P>
<P>You are very confident, indeed, interrupted
<HI>Arabella,</HI> again, to &s;uppo&s;e I will repeat what
would be infinitely grievous for me to hear.
Again&s;t my Will, pur&s;ued &s;he, I mu&s;t give you
the Satisfaction to know, that I am not igno|rant
of your Crime, but I al&s;o a&s;&s;ure you that I
am highly incens'd; and that, not only with the
Thoughts you have dar'd to entertain of me,
but likewi&s;e with your Pre&s;umption in going
about to di&s;clo&s;e them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> whom the &s;eeming Contradictions
in this Speech a&s;toni&s;h'd, yet imagin'd in ge|neral
it hinted at the Di&s;pute between him and
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el;</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ing the Story had been
told to his Di&s;advantage, which was the Cau&s;e
of her Anger, reply'd in great Emotion at the
Inju&s;tice done him.</P>
<P>Since &s;omebody has been &s;o officious to ac|quaint
your Lady&s;hip with an Affair which
ought to have been kept from your Knowledge;
'tis a Pity they did not inform you, that
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was the Per&s;on that had the lea&s;t
Re&s;pect for your Lady&s;hip, and is more worthy
of your Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is guilty of
an Offence like yours, yet &s;ince he has con|ceal'd
it better, he is le&s;s culpable than you;
and you have done that for him, which haply
<PB N="178" REF="180">
he would never have had Courage enough to do
for him&s;elf as long as he lived.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Selvin,</HI> quite confounded at the&s;e intri|cate
Words, would have begg'd her to explain
her&s;elf, had &s;he not &s;ilenc'd him with a dreadful
Frown: Aand making a Stop till Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> came up to them. She told her
Cou&s;in with a peevi&s;h Accent, that &s;he had
perform'd her Promi&s;e very ill; and whi&s;per'd
her, that &s;he was to blame for all the Mortifi|cations
&s;he had &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the Alteration in
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Humour proceeded from being &s;o long
depriv'd of his Company; endeavour'd to make
her Amends by a Profu&s;ion of Compliments;
which &s;he receiv'd with &s;uch an Air of Di&s;|plea&s;ure,
that the Beau, vex'd at the ill Succe&s;s of
his Gallantry, told her, he was afraid Mr. <HI>Sel|vin</HI>'s
Gravity had infected her Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>Say rather, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> that his Indi&s;|cretion
has offended me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> charm'd with this beginning Con|fidence,
which confirm'd his Hopes of having
made fome Impre&s;&s;ion on her Heart; conjur'd
her very earne&s;tly to tell him how Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
had offended her.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficient, re&s;um'd &s;he, that I tell you
he has offended me, without declaring the Na|ture
of his Crime, &s;ince doubtle&s;s it has not
e&s;caped your Ob&s;ervation, which, if I may
believe him, is not wholly di&s;intere&s;ted. To
confe&s;s yet more, 'tis true that he hath told me
&s;omething concerning you, which&mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
How, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> a little di&s;concerted,
Will you always per&s;i&s;t in a Denial then?</P>
<P>Deny it, Madam, return'd Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> I'll
deny what he has &s;aid with my la&s;t Breath; 'tis
all a &s;candalous Forgery: No Man living is le&s;s
likely to think of your Lady&s;hip in that Man|ner.
If you knew my Thoughts, Madam,
you would be convinc'd nothing is more im|po&s;&s;ible,
and&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely morti|fy'd,
methinks you are very eager in your Ju|&s;tification.
I promi&s;e you, I do not think you
guilty of the Offence he charg'd you with; if
I did, you would haply experience my Re&s;ent|ment

I do really admire your great Skill in Strata|gems,

<P>I don't know what you mean, reply'd <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI>
y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">u talk in Riddles. Did you not your&s;elf ac|quaint
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> with the Preference I gave

<P>Forgive me, Sir, replied <HI>Selvin,</HI> in a Rage,
I don't want your Forgivene&s;s. I have done

'Faith, I don't know how it is, but I am very

<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;urpriz'd at her in-attention, re|iterated
her Commands, in a Tone &s;omewhat
<PB N="183" REF="185">
louder than u&s;ual; asking her at the &s;ame Time,
why &s;he did not obey her immediately?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Lady|&s;hip
would not order me to take back the Let|ters,
if you knew what they were: They are
not Love-Letters; I was re&s;olv'd to be &s;ure of
that before I took them. This, Madam, is a
Letter about Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence; and the

But &s;tay, pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;eeing &s;he was about to

is &s;o: Indeed it may contain an Adverti&s;ement

Give me that Letter, <HI>Lucy,</HI> I am re&s;olved to
open it. As for the other&mdash;yet who knows
but the other may al&s;o bring me Warning of

Prince&s;s of <HI>Cappadocia;</HI> who, like me, in
one and the &s;ame Day, receiv'd Advice that
two of her Lovers intended to carry her off.</P>
<P>As &s;he pronounc'd the&s;e Words Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
enter'd the Room, to whom <HI>Arabella</HI> immedi|ately
recounted the Adventure of the Letters;
telling her, &s;he did not doubt, but they contain'd
a Di&s;covery of &s;ome Con&s;piracy to carry her
away.</P>
<P>And whom does your Lady&s;hip &s;u&s;pect of &s;uch
a &s;trange De&s;ign, pray, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
&s;miling?</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> the two Cava|liers
who walk'd with us to Day, are the Per|&s;ons
who &s;eem the mo&s;t likely to attempt that
Violence.</P>
<P>I dare an&s;wer for Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> replied Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> he thinks of no &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> to convince you of your
Mi&s;take, I mu&s;t inform you, that Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI>
having the Pre&s;umption to begin a Declaration
of Love to me on the Parade this Morning, I
reprov'd him &s;everely for his Want of Re&s;pect,
and threatned him with my Di&s;plea&s;ure; in the
Rage of his Jealou&s;y, at &s;eeing me treat
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> well, he di&s;cover'd to me, that he
al&s;o was as criminal as him&s;elf, in order to
oblige me to a &s;everer U&s;age of him.</P>
<P>So he told you Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was in Love with
you, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville?</HI></P>
<P>He told it me in other Words, reply'd <HI>Arabella;</HI>
for he &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> was guilty of that Of|fence,
which I re&s;ented &s;o &s;everely to him.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> beginning to comprehend the
My&s;tery, with great Difficulty forbore laugh|ing
at her Cou&s;in's Mi&s;take; for &s;he well knew
the Offence Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> hinted at, and de&s;irous
of knowing what tho&s;e Letters contain'd, &s;he
begg'd her to delay opening them no longer.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> pleas'd at her Solicitude, open'd
one of the Letters; but glancing her Eye to
the Bottom, and &s;eeing the Name of <HI>Selvin,</HI>
&s;he threw it ha&s;tily upon the Table, and avert|ing
her Eyes, What a Mortification have I
avoided, &s;aid &s;he, that Letter is from <HI>Selvin;</HI>
and que&s;tionle&s;s, contains an Avowal of his
Crime.</P>
<P>Nay, you mu&s;t read it, cried Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
taking it up; &s;ince you have open'd it, its the
&s;ame Thing: You can never per&s;uade him but
you have &s;een it. However, to &s;pare your
Nicety, I'll read it to you. Which accordingly
&s;he did, and found it as follows.</P>

My Thoughts of your Lady&s;hip are very

</LETTER>
<P>How's this, cry'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville?</HI> Why,
Madam, you are certainly mi&s;taken. You &s;ee
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> utterly denies the Crime of loving
you. He has &s;uffer'd very innocently in your
Opinion. Indeed, your Lady&s;hip was too ha&s;ty
in condemning him.</P>
<P>If what he &s;ays be true, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who had been in extream Confu&s;ion, while a
Letter &s;o different from what &s;he expected was
reading; I have indeed unju&s;tly condemn'd
him. Neverthele&s;s, I am &s;till inclin'd to be|lieve
this is all Artifice; and that he is really
guilty of entertaining a Pa&s;&s;ion for me.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould he take &s;o much Pains to
deny it, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville?</HI> Methinks
that looks very odd.</P>
<P>Not at all, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Spi|rits
were rais'd by recollecting an Adventure in
her Romance, &s;imilar to this. Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> has
fallen upon the very &s;ame Stratagem with <HI>Sera|menes;</HI>
who being in Love with the beautiful
<HI>Cleobuline,</HI> Prince&s;s of <HI>Corinth,</HI> took all ima|ginable
Pains to conceal his Pa&s;&s;ion, in order
<PB N="187" REF="189">
to be near that fair Prince&s;s; who would have
bani&s;h'd him from her Pre&s;ence, had &s;he known
he was in Love with her. Nay, he went &s;o
far in his Di&s;&s;imulation, as to pretend Love to
one of the Ladies of her Court; that his Pa&s;|&s;ion
for the Prince&s;s might be the le&s;s taken no|tice
of. In the&s;e Ca&s;es therefore, the more re|&s;olutely
a Man denies his Pa&s;&s;ion, the more
pure and violent it is.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion is certainly very
violent, reply'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> for he denies it
very re&s;olutely; and I believe none but your
Lady&s;hip would have di&s;cover'd his Artifice.
But &s;hall we not open the other Letter? I have
a &s;trong Notion it comes from <HI>Tin&s;el.</HI></P>
<P>For that very Rea&s;on I would not be ac|quainted
with the Contents, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI>
You &s;ee, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> accu&s;es him of being guilty
of that Offence which he denies: I &s;hall doubt|le&s;s,
meet with a Confirmation of his Love in
that Letter. Do not, I be&s;eech you added
&s;he, &s;eeing her Cou&s;in preparing to open the
Letter, expo&s;e me to the Pain of hearing a pre|&s;umptuous
Declaration of Love. Nay, pur|&s;ued
&s;he, ri&s;ing in great Emotion, if you are
re&s;olved to per&s;ecute me by reading it, I'll en|deavour

<P>You &s;han't, I declare, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>

<P><PB N="189" REF="191">
Well, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> when
&s;he had read this Epi&s;tle, I fancy you need not
pronounce a Sentence of Bani&s;hment upon poor
Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el;</HI> he &s;eems to be quite innocent of
the Offence your Lady&s;hip &s;u&s;pects him of.</P>
<P>Why, really, return'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing
with extreme Confu&s;ion at this &s;econd Di&s;ap|pointment,
I am greatly perplex'd to know
how I ought to act on this Occa&s;ion. I am
much in the &s;ame Situation with the Prince&s;s
<HI>Serena.</HI> For you mu&s;t know, this Prince&s;s&mdash;
Here <HI>Lucy</HI> entering, inform'd the Ladies Din|ner
was &s;erv'd&mdash;I &s;hall defer till another Op|portunity,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> upon this Interruption,
the Relation of the Prince&s;s <HI>Serena</HI>'s Adven|tures;
which you will find, added &s;he, in a low
Voice, bears a very great Re&s;emblance to mine.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> reply'd, &s;he would hear it
whenever &s;he pleas'd, and then follow'd <HI>Arabella</HI>
to the Dining Room.</P>
<P>The Cloth was &s;carce remov'd, when
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> came in. <HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;h'd at his
Appearance, and di&s;cover'd &s;o much Perplexity
in her Behaviour, that Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was appre|hen&s;ive
he had not yet &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify'd him|&s;elf;
and therefore took the fir&s;t Opportunity
to approach her.</P>
<P>I &s;hall think my&s;elf very unhappy, Madam,
&s;aid he bowing, if the Letter I did my&s;elf the
Honour to write to you this Morning&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> I perceive you are
going to forget the Contents of that Letter,
and preparing again to offend me by a pre&s;ump|tuous
Declaration of Love.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
Who I, Madam, reply'd he, in great A&s;to|ni&s;hment
and Confu&s;ion, I-I-I prote&s;t&mdash;tho'
I-I have a very great Re&s;pect for your Lady|&s;hip,
yet&mdash;yet I never pre&s;um'd to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;</P>
<P>You have pre&s;um'd too much, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
and I &s;hould forget what I ow'd to my
own Glory, if I furni&s;h'd you with any more
Occa&s;ions of offending me.&mdash;Know then, I
ab&s;olutely forbid you to appear before me again,
at lea&s;t, till I am convinc'd you have chang'd
your Sentiments.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he ro&s;e from her Seat, and
making a Sign to him not to follow her, which
indeed he had no Intention to do, &s;he quitted
the Room, highly &s;atisfy'd with her own Con|duct
upon this Occa&s;ion, which was exactly
conformable to the Laws of Romance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> who had ju&s;t alighted from his
Chair, having a Glimp&s;e of her, as &s;he pa&s;s'd
to her own Apartment, re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to
procure a private Interview; for he did not
doubt but his Billet had done Wonders in his
Favour.</P>
<P>For that Purpo&s;e he ventur'd up to her Anti-Chamber,
where he found <HI>Lucy</HI> in waiting,
whom he de&s;ir'd to acquaint her Lady, that he
intreated a Moment's Speech with her.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> after he&s;itating a Moment, and look|ing
earne&s;tly at him, replied, Sir, if you'll
promi&s;e me faithfully, you are not in Love
with my Lady, I'll go and deliver your Me&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>Duce take me, &s;aid <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> if that is not a
very whim&s;ical Condition truly&mdash;Pray, my
Dear, how came it into thy little Brain, to
<PB N="191" REF="193">
&s;u&s;pect I was in Love with thy Lady? But,
&s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould be in Love with her, what
then?</P>
<P>Why, then its likely you would die, that's
all, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> without my Lady would be &s;o
kind to command you to live.</P>
<P>I vow thou ha&s;t mighty pretty Notions, Child,
&s;aid <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> &s;miling; ha&s;t thou been reading
any Play-Book lately? But pray, do&s;t think
thy Lady would have compa&s;&s;ion on me, if I
was in Love with her? Come, I know thou
art in her Confidence? Ha&s;t thou ever heard
her talk of me? Does &s;he not tell thee all her
Secrets?</P>
<P>Here <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Bell ringing, the Beau &s;lipp'd
half a Guinea into her Hand, which <HI>Lucy</HI> not
willing to refu&s;e, went immediately to her
Lady; to whom, with a trembling Accent,
&s;he repeated Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI>'s Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Imprudent Girl, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> for I am
loth to &s;u&s;pect thee of Di&s;loyalty to thy Mi&s;tre&s;s.
Do&s;t thou know the Nature and Extent of the
Reque&s;t thou ha&s;t deliver'd? Art thou ignorant
that the pre&s;umptuous Man whom thou &s;ollicite&s;t
this Favour for, has mortally offended me?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy</HI> frighted out of
her Wits, I don't &s;ollicit for him. I &s;corn to do
any &s;uch Thing. I would not offend your
Lady&s;hip for the World: For, before I would
deliver his Me&s;&s;age to your Lady&s;hip, I made
him a&s;&s;ure me, that he was not in Love with
your Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>That was very wi&s;ely done, indeed, replied
<HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling: And do you believe he &s;poke
the Truth?</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194">
Yes, indeed, I am &s;ure of it, &s;aid <HI>Lucy</HI>
eagerly, if your Lady&s;hip will but be pleas'd to
&s;ee him, he is only in the next Room; I dare
promi&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>How, interrupted <HI>Arabella!</HI> What have you
done? Have you brought him into my Apart|ment
then? I prote&s;t this Adventure is exactly
like what befel the beautiful <HI>Statira,</HI> when, by
a Stratagem of the &s;ame Kind, <HI>Oroondates</HI> was
introduc'd into her Pre&s;ence. <HI>Lucy,</HI> thou art
another <HI>Bar&s;ina,</HI> I think; but I hope thy In|tentions
are not le&s;s innocent than hers was.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, reply'd <HI>Lucy,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively
unea&s;y at her Lady's Words, I am very inno|cent,
I am no <HI>Bar&s;ina,</HI> as your Lady&s;hip calls
me.</P>
<P>I dare an&s;wer for thee, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;miling
at the Turn &s;he gave to her Words, thou art
no <HI>Bar&s;ina;</HI> and I &s;hould wrong thee very
much to compare thee with that wi&s;e Prince&s;s;
for thou art certainly one of the mo&s;t &s;imple
Wenches in the World. But &s;ince thou ha&s;t
gone &s;o far, let me know what the unfortunate
Per&s;on de&s;ires of me; for, &s;ince I am neither
more rigid, nor pretend to more Virtue than
<HI>Statira,</HI> I may do at lea&s;t as much for him, as
that great Queen did for <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>He de&s;ires, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> that your
Lady&s;hip would be pleas'd to let him &s;peak with
you.</P>
<P>Or, in his Words, I &s;uppo&s;e, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
he humbly implor'd a Moment's Audience.</P>
<P>I told your Lady&s;hip his very Words, indeed,
Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">
I tell thee, Girl, thou art mi&s;taken, &s;aid

brought again into my Chamber, and by what
Means was I re&s;cu'd?</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I don't know that
you have been out of it.</P>
<P>Alas, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I perceive you are
quite ignorant of what has befallen me; nor
am I able to give you any Information: All I
can tell you is, that alarm'd by my Womens
Cries, and the Sight of my Ravi&s;her, who
came into my Chamber, I fainted away, and
&s;o faciliated his Enterprize; &s;ince doubtle&s;s it
was very ea&s;y for him to carry me away while
I remain'd in that &s;en&s;ele&s;s Condition. How I
was re&s;cu'd, or by whom, one of my Women
can haply inform you; &s;ince its probable one of
them was al&s;o forc'd away with me&mdash;Oh
Heav'ns! cry'd &s;he, &s;eeing <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> who all this
while &s;tood gazing like one di&s;tracted; what
makes that impious Man in my Pre&s;ence!
What am I to think of this? Am I really de|liver'd
or no?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199">
What can this mean, cried Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> turn|ing
to <HI>Tin&s;el?</HI> Have you, Sir, had any Hand
in frighting my Niece?&mdash;</P>
<P>I, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Tin&s;el!</HI> Let me peri&s;h if ever I
was &s;o confounded in my Life: The Lady's
Brain is di&s;order'd I believe.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was convinc'd all this
Confu&s;ion was caus'd by &s;ome of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
u&s;ual Whims, dreaded le&s;t an Explanation would
the more expo&s;e her; and therefore told his
Father, that it would be be&s;t to retire, and leave
his Cou&s;in to the Care of his Si&s;ter and her Wo|men;
adding, that &s;he was not yet quite reco|ver'd,
and their Pre&s;ence did but di&s;compo&s;e
her.</P>
<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> told him
he would wait upon him down Stairs.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> &s;eeing them going away together,
and &s;uppo&s;ing they intended to di&s;pute the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her with their Swords, call'd out to
them to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> however, without minding her,
pre&s;s'd Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> to walk down.</P>
<P>Nay, pray, Sir, &s;aid the Beau, let us go in
again; &s;he may grow outrageous if we di&s;oblige
her.</P>
<P>Outrageous, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> do you &s;up|po&s;e
my Cou&s;in is mad?</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Sir, replied <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> if &s;he is
not mad, &s;he is certainly a little out of her
Sen&s;es, or &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having reiterated her Commands for
her Lovers to return, and finding they did not
obey her, ran to her Chamber-door, where they
were holding a &s;urly Sort of Conference, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="198" REF="200">
on <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Side, who was horridly out
of Humour.</P>
<P>I perceive by your Looks. &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> to
her Cou&s;in, the De&s;ign you are meditating;
but know that I ab&s;olutely forbid you, by all
the Power I have over you, not to engage in
Combat with my Ravi&s;her here.</P>
<P>Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> I be&s;eech you
do not&mdash;</P>
<P>I know, &s;aid &s;he, you will object to me the
Examples of <HI>Artamenes, Aronces,</HI> and many
others, who were &s;o generous as to promi&s;e
their Rivals not to refu&s;e them that Satisfaction
whenever they demanded it&mdash;but con&s;ider, you
have not the &s;ame Obligations to Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> that
<HI>Artamenes</HI> had to the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> or that
<HI>Arances</HI> had to&mdash;</P>
<P>For God's Sake, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> what's
all this to the Purpo&s;e? Cur&s;e on <HI>Aronces</HI> and
the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> I &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>The A&s;toni&s;hment of <HI>Arabella</HI> at this intem|perate
Speech of her Cou&s;in, kept her for a Mo|ment
immoveable, when Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who du|ring
this Di&s;cour&s;e, had been collecting all the
Information he could from <HI>Lucy,</HI> concerning
this perplex'd Affair, came towards <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> and
giving him an angry Look, told him, He &s;hould
take it well if he forbore vi&s;iting any of his Fa|mily
for the future.</P>
<P>Oh! Your mo&s;t obedient Servant, Sir, &s;aid
<HI>Tin&s;el:</HI> You expect, I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hould be ex|ce&s;&s;ively
chagrin'd at this Prohibition? But up|on
my Soul, I am greatly oblig'd to you. Agad!
I have no great Mind to a Halter: And &s;ince
this Lady is &s;o apt to think People have a De&s;ign
<PB N="199" REF="201">
to ravi&s;h her, the wi&s;e&s;t Thing a Man can do,
is to keep out of her Way.</P>
<P>Sir, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had follow'd him
to the Door, I believe there was been &s;ome little
Mi&s;take in what has happen'd To-day&mdash;How|ever,
I expect you'll take no unbecoming Li|berties
with the Character of Lady <HI>Bella</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, &s;aid <HI>Tin&s;el,</HI> I give you my Honour
I &s;hall always &s;peak of the Lady with the mo&s;t
profound Veneration. She is a mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd,
incomprehen&s;ible Lady: And the De|vil
take me, if I think there is her Fellow in
the World&mdash;And &s;o, Sir, I am your mo&s;t
obedient&mdash;</P>
<P>A Word with you before you go, &s;aid
<HI>Glanville</HI> &s;topping him&mdash;No more of the&s;e Sneers
as you value that &s;mooth Face of yours, or I'll
de&s;poil it of a No&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh! Your humble Servant, &s;aid the Beau,
retiring in great Confu&s;ion, with &s;omething be|twixt
a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance,
which he took Care however Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
&s;hould not &s;ee; who as &s;oon as he quitted him
went again to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment, in order to
prevail upon his Father and Si&s;ter to leave her
a little to her&s;elf, for he dreaded le&s;t &s;ome more
In&s;tances of her Extravagance would put it in|to
his Father's Head, that &s;he was really out of
her Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> upon his Entrance,
you have I &s;uppo&s;e, given your Rival his Li|berty.
I a&s;&s;ure you this Genero&s;ity is highly
agreeable to me&mdash;And herein you imitate the
noble <HI>Artamenes,</HI> who upon a like Occa&s;ion,
acted as you have done. For when Fortune
<PB N="200" REF="202">
had put the Ravi&s;her of <HI>Mandana</HI> in his Power,
and he became the Vanqui&s;her of his Rival,
who endeavour'd by Violence to po&s;&s;e&s;s that di|vine
Prince&s;s; this truly generous Hero relin|qui&s;h'd
the Right he had of di&s;po&s;ing of his Pri|&s;oner,
and in&s;tead of &s;acrificing his Life to his
ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Vengeance, he gave a Proof
of his admirable Virtue and Clemency by di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing
him in Safety, as you have done. How|ever,
added &s;he, I hope you have made him
&s;wear upon your Sword, that he will never
make a &s;econd Attempt upon my Liberty. I
perceive, pur&s;ued &s;he, &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> con|tinued
&s;ilent, with his Eyes bent on the
Ground, for indeed he was a&s;ham'd to look up;
that you would willingly avoid the Prai&s;e due
to the heroick Action you have ju&s;t perform'd&mdash;
Nay, I &s;uppo&s;e you are re&s;olv'd to keep it &s;ecret
if po&s;&s;ible; yet I mu&s;t tell you, that you will
not e&s;cape the Glory due to it. Glory is as
nece&s;&s;arily the Re&s;ult of a virtuous Action, as
Light is an Effect of the Sun which cau&s;eth it,
and has no Dependence on any other Cau&s;e;
&s;ince a virtuous Action continues &s;till the &s;ame,
tho' it be done without Te&s;timony; and Glory,
which is, as one may &s;ay born with it, con|&s;tantly
attends it, tho' the Action be not known.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that's very
prettily &s;aid.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, Sir, pur&s;ued <HI>Arabella,</HI> if
any thing can weaken the Glory of a good
Action, its the Care a Per&s;on takes to make it
known: As if one did not do Good for the
Sake of Good, but for the Prai&s;e that generally
follows it. Tho&s;e then that are govern'd by
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;o intere&s;ted a Motive, ought to be con&s;ider'd
as &s;ordid rather than generous Per&s;ons; who
making a Kind of Traffick between Virtue and
Glory, barter ju&s;t &s;o much of the one for the
other and expect like other Merchants, to
make Advantage by the Exchange.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was charm'd into an Ex|tacy
at this &s;en&s;ible Speech of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, forgot
in an In&s;tant all her Ab&s;urdities. He did not
fail to expre&s;s his Admiration of her Under|&s;tanding
in Terms that brought a Blu&s;h into
her fair Face, and oblig'd her to lay her Com|mands
upon him to cea&s;e his exce&s;&s;ive Com|mendations.
Then making a Sign to them to
leave her alone, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> who under&s;tood
her, took his Father and Si&s;ter down Stairs,
leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> with her faithful <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom
&s;he immediately commanded to give her a Re|lation
of what had happen'd to her from the
Time of her &s;wooning till &s;he recover'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Dialogue between Arabella and Lucy,
in which the latter &s;eems to have the
Advantage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHY, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> all I can tell
your Lady&s;hip is, that we were all ex|ce&s;&s;ively
frighted, to be &s;ure, when you faint|ed,
e&s;pecially my&s;elf; and that we did what
we could to recover you&mdash;And &s;o accordingly
your Lady&s;hip did recover.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">
What's this to the Purpo&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
perceiving &s;he &s;top'd here? I know that I faint|ed,
and 'tis al&s;o very plain that I recover'd
again&mdash;I ask you what happen'd to me in the
intermediate Time between my Fainting and
Recovery. Give me a faithful Relation of all
the Accidents, to which by my Fainting I am
quite a Stranger; and which no doubt, are very
con&s;iderable&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I have given
your Lady&s;hip a faithful Relation of all I can
remember.</P>
<P>When, re&s;um'd <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;urpiz'd?&mdash;</P>
<P>This Moment, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>Why, &s;ure thou dream'&s;t Wench, replied
&s;he, Ha&s;t thou told me how I was &s;eiz'd and
carry'd off? How I was re&s;cu'd again? And&mdash;</P>
<P>No, indeed, Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> I
don't dream; I never told your Lady&s;hip that
you was carry'd off.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> and why do&s;t thou not
&s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity? Is it not fit I &s;hould be
acquainted with &s;uch a momentous Part of my
Hi&s;tory?</P>
<P>I can't indeed, and plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip,
&s;aid <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>What, can'&s;t thou not, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> en|rag'd
at her Stupidity, as &s;he thought it.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy</HI> &s;obbing, I can't
make a Hi&s;tory of nothing.</P>
<P>Of nothing, Wench, re&s;um'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> in
a greater Rage than before: Do&s;t thou call an
Adventure to which thou was a Witne&s;s, and
bore&s;t haply &s;o great a Share in, nothing?&mdash;An
Adventure which hereafter will make a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="203" REF="205">
Figure in the Relation of my Life, do&s;t
thou look upon as tri&s;ling and of no Con&s;e|quence?</P>
<P>No, indeed I don't, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>Why then, pur&s;ued <HI>Arabella,</HI> do&s;t thou wil|fully
neglect to relate it? Suppo&s;e, as there is
nothing more likely, thou wert commanded by
&s;ome Per&s;ons of con&s;iderable Quality, or haply
&s;ome great Princes and Prince&s;&s;es, to recount
the Adventures of my Life, would'&s;t thou omit
a Circum&s;tance of &s;o much Moment?</P>
<P>No indeed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to hear thou art &s;o di&s;creet, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and pray do me the Favour to relate
this Adventure to me, as thou would'&s;t do to
tho&s;e Princes and Prince&s;&s;es, if thou wert com|manded.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Arabella</HI> making a full Stop, fix'd her
Eyes upon her Woman, expecting every Mo|ment
&s;he would begin the de&s;ir'd Narrative&mdash;
But finding &s;he continu'd &s;ilent longer than &s;he
thought was nece&s;&s;ary for recalling the &s;everal
Circum&s;tances of the Story into her Mind,</P>
<P>I find, &s;aid &s;he, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to cau|tion
you again&s;t making your Audience wait too
long for your Relation; it looks as if you was
to make a &s;tudied Speech, not a &s;imple Relation
of Facts, which ought to be free from all Af|fectation
of Labour and Art; and be told with
that graceful Negligence which is &s;o becoming
to Truth.</P>
<P>This I thought proper to tell you, added &s;he,
that you may not fall into that Mi&s;take when you
are called upon to relate my Adventures&mdash;
Well, now if you plea&s;e to begin&mdash;,</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">
What, pray, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy?</HI></P>
<P>What, repeated <HI>Arabella?</HI> Why, the Ad|ventures
which happen'd to me &s;o lately. Re|late
to me every Circum&s;tance of my being
carried away, and how my Deliverance was ef|fected
by my Cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> I know nothing
about your Lady&s;hip's being carried away. All
I know is&mdash;</P>
<P>Begone, cried <HI>Arabella</HI> lo&s;ing all Patience at
her Ob&s;tinacy, get out of my Pre&s;ence this
Moment. Wretch, unworthy of my Confi|dence
and Favour, thy Trea&s;on is too manife&s;t,
thou art brib'd by that pre&s;umptuous Man to
conceal all the Circum&s;tances of his Attempt
from my Knowleddge, to the End that I may
not have a full Conviction of his Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who never &s;aw her Lady &s;o much of|fended
before, and knew not the Occa&s;ion of
it, bur&s;t into Tears; which &s;o affected the
tender Heart of <HI>Arabella,</HI> that lo&s;ing in&s;en&s;ibly
all her Anger, &s;he told her with a Voice &s;oft|en'd
to a Tone of the utmo&s;t Sweetne&s;s and
Conde&s;cen&s;ion, that provided &s;he would con|fe&s;s
how far &s;he had been prevail'd upon by his
rich Pre&s;ents, to forget her Duty, &s;he would
pardon and receive her again into Favour&mdash;</P>
<P>Speak, added &s;he, and be not afraid after this
Promi&s;e, to let me know what Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> re|quir'd
of thee, and what were the Gifts with
which he purchas'd thy Services: doubtle&s;s, he
pre&s;ented thee with Jewels of a con&s;iderable
Value&mdash;</P>
<P>Since your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid <HI>Lucy</HI> &s;obbing, has
promis'd not to be angry, I don't care if I do
<PB N="205" REF="207">
tell your Lady&s;hip what he gave me. He gave
me this half Guinea, Madam, indeed he did;
but for all that, when he would come into
your Chamber I &s;truggled with him, and cry'd
out, for fear he &s;hould carry your Lady&s;hip
away&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> lo&s;t in A&s;toni&s;hment and Shame at
hearing of &s;o incon&s;iderable a Pre&s;ent made to
her Woman, the like of which not one of her
Romances could furni&s;h her, order'd her im|mediately
to withdraw, not being willing &s;he

<P>After &s;he had been gone &s;ome Time, &s;he en|deavour'd

down to the Dining-Room, where Sir <HI>Charles</HI>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> who with a mali|cious
Plea&s;ure had &s;ecretly tri|umph'd
in the Extravagances her
beautiful Cou&s;in had been guilty
of, was now &s;en&s;ibly di&s;appointed
to find they had had &s;o little Effect on her Father
and Brother; for in&s;tead of reflecting upon the
Ab&s;urdities to which they had been a Witne&s;s,
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> artfully pur&s;u'd the Subject <HI>Arabella</HI>
ju&s;t before had been expatiating upon, taking no|tice
frequently of &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of hers, and
<PB N="207" REF="209">
by a well contriv'd Repetition of her Words,
oblig'd his Father a &s;econd Time to declare that
his Niece had &s;poken extremely well.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> taking the Word, launch'd out
into &s;uch Prai&s;es of her Wit, that Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
no longer able to li&s;ten patiently, reply'd,</P>
<P>'Twas true Lady <HI>Bella</HI> &s;ometimes &s;aid very
&s;en&s;ible Things; that 'twas a great Pity &s;he was
not always in a rea&s;onable Way of thinking,
or that her Intervals were not longer&mdash;</P>
<P>Her Intervals, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> pray
what do you mean by that Expre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, pray, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> don't you
think my Cou&s;in is &s;ometimes a little wrong in
the Head?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> at the&s;e Words &s;tarting from
his Chair, took a Turn a-cro&s;s the Room in
great Di&s;compo&s;ure, then &s;topping all of a &s;ud|den,
and giving his Si&s;ter a furious Look&mdash;
<HI>Charlotte,</HI> &s;aid he, don't give me Cau&s;e to think
you are envious of your Cou&s;in's &s;uperior Ex|cellencies&mdash;</P>
<P>Envious, repeated Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I envious
of my Cou&s;in&mdash;I vow I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">uld never have
thought of that&mdash;Indeed, Brother, you are
much mi&s;taken; my Cou&s;in's &s;uperior Excel|lencies
never gave me a Moment's Di&s;turbance&mdash;
Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s her unaccountable Whims
have often excited my Pity&mdash;</P>
<P>No more of this, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as you value my Friend&s;hip&mdash;
No more of it&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, really Son, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> my Niece
has very &s;trange Whim&s;ies &s;ometimes. How
it came into her Head to think Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> would
<PB N="208" REF="210">
attempt to carry her away, I can't imagine?
For after all, he only pre&s;t rather too rudely
into her Chamber, for which, as you &s;ee, I
have ferbidden his Vi&s;its.</P>
<P>That was of a Piece, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
&s;neeringly to her Brother, with her asking you
if you had made Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> &s;wear upon your
Sword, that he would never again attempt to
carry her away; and applauding you for having
given him his Liberty, as the generous <HI>Atermens</HI>
did on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I would advi&s;e you, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
not to aim at repeating your Cou&s;ins's
Words, till you know how to pronounce them
properly.</P>
<P>Oh! that's one of her &s;uperior Excellencies,
&s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Glanville</HI> very provokingly,
&s;he is &s;uperior to you in many Things; and as
much &s;o in the Goodne&s;s of her Heart, as in
the Beauty of her Per&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid the Baronet,
who ob&s;erv'd his Daughter &s;at &s;welling and bi|ting
her Lip at this Reproach, per&s;onal Reflecti|ons
are better avoided. Your Si&s;ter is very well,
and not to be di&s;parag'd; tho' to be &s;ure, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> is the fine&s;t Woman I ever &s;aw in my
Life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was, if po&s;&s;ible, more di&s;gu&s;ted
at her Father's Palliation than her Brother's Re|proaches;
and in order to give a Loo&s;e to her
Pa&s;&s;ion, accus'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> of a Decrea&s;e in
his Affection for her, &s;ince he had been in Love
with her Cou&s;in; and having found this Excu&s;e
for her Tears, very freely gave vent to them&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211">
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> being &s;oftned by this Sight, &s;a|crificed
a few Compliments to her Vanity,

then turning the Di&s;cour&s;e on his beloved <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
pronounc'd a Panegyrick on her Virtues
and Accompli&s;hments of an Hour long; which,
if it did not ab&s;olutely per&s;uade his Si&s;ter to
change her Opinion, it certainly convinc'd his
Father, that his Niece was not only perfectly
well in her Under&s;tanding, but even better than
mo&s;t others of her Sex.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had ju&s;t fini&s;h'd her Eulogium,

a Kind of con&s;cious Triumph in his Looks;
her con&s;ummate Loveline&s;s ju&s;tifying his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and being in his Opinion, more than an
Excu&s;e for all her Extravagancies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine, as we pre&s;ume,
&s;hews her&s;elf in two very different
Lights.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who at her Entrance had
perceiv'd &s;ome Traces of Unea&s;ine&s;s upon
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Countenance, tenderly ask'd her
the Cau&s;e; to which that young Lady an&s;wer|ing
in a cold and re&s;erv'd Manner, Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
to divert her Reflexions on it, very freely
accus'd him&s;elf of having given his Si&s;ter &s;ome
Offence. To be &s;ure, Brother, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="212">
you are very vehement in your Temper, and
are as violently carry'd away about Things of
little Importance as of the greate&s;t; and then,
whatever you have a Fancy for, you love &s;o
ob&s;tinately.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to you, Mi&s;s, interrupted
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> for endeavouring to give Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> &s;o unfavourable an Opinion of me&mdash;</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> has
&s;aid nothing to your Di&s;advantage: For, in my
Opinion, the Temperament of great Minds
ought to be &s;uch as &s;he repre&s;ents yours to be.
For there is nothing at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from
true and heroick Virtue, as that Indifference
which obliges &s;ome People to be pleas'd with all
Things or nothing: Whence it comes to pa&s;s,
that they neither entertain great De&s;ires of Glo|ry,
nor Fear of Infamy; that they neither love
nor hate; that they are wholly influenc'd by
Cu&s;tom, and are &s;en&s;ible only of the Afflictions
of the Body, their Minds being in a Manner
in&s;en&s;ible&mdash;</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, I am inclin'd to conceive
a greater Hope of a Man, who in the Begin|ning
of his Life is hurry'd away by &s;ome evil
Habit, than one that fa&s;tens on nothing: The
Mind that cannot be brought to dete&s;t Vice,
will never be per&s;uaded to love Virtue; but one
who is capable of loving or hating irreconcile|bly,
by having, when young, his Pa&s;&s;ions di|rected
to proper Objects, will remain fix'd in
his Choice of what is good. But with him who
is incapable of any violent Attraction, and
who&s;e Heart is chilled by a general Indiffer|ence,
Precept or Example will have no Force&mdash;
<PB N="211" REF="213">
And Philo&s;ophy it&s;elf, which boa&s;ts it hath Re|medies
for all Indi&s;po&s;itions of the Soul, never
had any that can cure an indifferent Mind&mdash;
Nay, added &s;he, I am per&s;uaded that Indiffe|rence
is generally the in&s;eparable Companion of
a weak and imperfect Judgment. For it is &s;o
natural to a Per&s;on to be carry'd towards that
which he believes to be good, that if indifferent
People were able to judge of Things, they would
fa&s;ten on &s;omething. But certain it is that this
luke-warmne&s;s of Soul, which &s;ends &s;orth but
&s;eeble De&s;ires, &s;ends al&s;o but feeble Lights; &s;o
that tho&s;e who are guilty of it, not knowing
any thing clearly, cannot fa&s;ten on any thing
with Per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> when <HI>Arabella</HI> had fini&s;h'd
this Speech, ca&s;t a triumphing Glance at his
Si&s;ter, who had affected great In-attention all
the while &s;he had been &s;peaking. Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
in his Way, expre&s;s'd much Admiration of her
Wit, telling her, if &s;he had been a Man, &s;he
would have made a great Figure in Parliament,
and that her Speeches might have come perhaps
to be printed in time.</P>
<P>This Compliment, odd as it was, gave great
Joy to <HI>Glanville,</HI> when the Conver&s;ation was
interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who
had &s;lipt away unob&s;erv'd at the Time that
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Indi&s;po&s;ition had alarm'd them, and
now came to enquire after her Health; and al&s;o
if an Opportunity offer'd to &s;et her right with
Regard to the Su&s;picions &s;he had entertain'd of
his de&s;igning to pay his Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> as &s;oon as he had &s;ent in his Name,
appear'd to be in great Di&s;turbance; and upon
<PB N="212" REF="214">
his Entrance, offer'd immediately to withdraw,
telling Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who would have detain'd
her, that &s;he found no Place was likely to &s;e|cure
her from the Per&s;ecutions of that Gen|tleman.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> &s;tar'd, and look'd &s;trangely per|plex'd
at this Speech; Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;mil'd,
and poor <HI>Selvin,</HI> with a very &s;illy Look&mdash;hem'd
two or three times, and then with a faultring
Accent &s;aid, Madam, I am very much con|cern'd
to find your Lady&s;hip re&s;olv'd to per|&s;i&s;t
in&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Re&s;olutions
are unalterable. I told you &s;o before, and am
&s;urpriz'd, after the Knowledge of my Inten|tions,
you pre&s;ume to appear in my Pre&s;ence
again, from whence I had &s;o po&s;itively bani&s;h'd
you.</P>
<P>Pray, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> what has
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> done to di&s;oblige you?</P>
<P>Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s Offence
can admit of no other Reparation than that
which I requir'd of him, which was a volun|tary
Bani&s;hment from my Pre&s;ence: And in
this pur&s;u'd &s;he, I am guilty of no more Seve|rity
to you, than the Prince&s;s <HI>Udo&s;ia</HI> was to the
unfortunate <HI>Thra&s;imedes.</HI> For the Pa&s;&s;ion of
this Prince having come to her Knowledge,
notwith&s;tanding the Pains he took to conceal it,
this fair and wi&s;e Prince&s;s thought it not enough
to forbid his &s;peaking to her, but al&s;o bani&s;h'd
him from her Pre&s;ence; laying a peremptory
Command upon him, never to appear before
her again till he was perfectly cur'd of that un|happy
Love he had entertain'd for her&mdash;Imitate
<PB N="213" REF="215">
therefore the meritorious Obedience of this poor
Prince, and if that Pa&s;&s;ion you profe&s;s for me&mdash;</P>
<P>How, Sir, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> Do you
make Love to my Niece then?&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, replied Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who was &s;trangely
confounded at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Speech, tho' I really
admire the Perfections this Lady is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of,
yet I a&s;&s;ure you, upon my Honour, I never had
a Thought of making any Addre&s;&s;es to her;
and I can't imagine why her Lady&s;hip per&s;i&s;ts
in accu&s;ing me of &s;uch Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>So formal a Denial after what <HI>Arabella</HI> had
&s;aid, extremely perplex'd Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and fill'd
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> with inconceivable Shame&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> enjoy'd their Di&s;turbance, and
full of an ill-natur'd Triumph, endeavour'd to
look <HI>Arabella</HI> into Confu&s;ion: But that Lady
not being at all di&s;compos'd by this Declaration
of Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s, having accounted for it al|ready,
replied with great Calmne&s;s,</P>
<P>Sir, 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee thro' the Artifice of your
di&s;claiming any Pa&s;&s;ion for me&mdash;Upon any other
Occa&s;ion que&s;tionle&s;s, you would rather &s;acri|fice
your Life, than con&s;ent to di&s;avow the&s;e
Sentiments, which unhappily for your Peace
you have entertain'd. At pre&s;ent the De&s;ire of
continuing near me, obliges you to lay this
Con&s;traint upon your&s;elf; however you know
<HI>Thra&s;imedes</HI> fell upon the &s;ame Stratagem to no
Purpo&s;e. The rigid <HI>Udo&s;ia</HI> &s;aw thro' the Di&s;|gui&s;e,
and would not di&s;pen&s;e with her&s;elf from
bani&s;hing him from <HI>Rome,</HI> as I do you from
<HI>England</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>How, Madam! interrupted <HI>Selvin</HI> amaz'd&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216">
Yes, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella</HI> ha&s;tily, nothing
le&s;s can &s;atisfy what I owe to the Con&s;ideration
of my own Glory.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Selvin,</HI> half
angry, and yet &s;trongly inclin'd to laugh, I
don't &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of my quitting my na|tive
Country, to &s;atisfy what you owe to the
Con&s;ideration of your own Glory. Pray, how
does my &s;taying in <HI>England</HI> affect your Lady|&s;hip's
Glory?</P>
<P>To an&s;wer your Que&s;tion with another, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella,</HI> Pray how did the Stay of <HI>Thra&s;imedes</HI>
in <HI>Rome,</HI> affect the Glory of the Empre&s;s
<HI>Udo&s;ia?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was &s;truck dumb with this Speech,
for he was not willing to be thought &s;o deficient
in the Knowledge of Hi&s;tory, as not to be ac|quainted
with the Rea&s;ons why <HI>Thra&s;imedes</HI>
&s;hould not &s;tay in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>His Silence therefore &s;eeming to <HI>Arabella</HI> to
be a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion of the Ju&s;tice of her Com|mands,
a Sentiment of Compa&s;&s;ion for this un|fortunate
Lover, intruded it&s;elf into her Mind;
and turning her bright Eyes, full of a &s;oft Com|placency
upon <HI>Selvin,</HI> who &s;tar'd at her as if he
had lo&s;t his Wits&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not, &s;aid &s;he, wrong the Sublimity of
your Pa&s;&s;ion for me &s;o much, as to doubt your
being ready to &s;acrifice the Repo&s;e of your own
Life to the Satisfaction of mine: Nor will I
do &s;o much Inju&s;tice to your Genero&s;ity, as to
&s;uppo&s;e the Glory of obeying my Commands,
will not in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;often the Rigour of
your De&s;tiny&mdash;I know not whether it may be
lawful for me to tell you, that your Misfortune
<PB N="215" REF="217">
does really cau&s;e me &s;ome Affliction; but I am
willing to give you this Con&s;olation, and al&s;o
to a&s;&s;ure you, that to whatever Part of the
World your De&s;pair will carry you, the good
Wi&s;hes and Compa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;hall follow
you&mdash;</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, with one of her fair Hands
&s;he cover'd her Face, to hide the Blu&s;hes which
&s;o compa&s;&s;ionate a Speech had caus'd&mdash;Holding
the other extended with a carele&s;s Air, &s;up|po&s;ing
he would kneel to ki&s;s it, and bathe it
with his Tears, as was the Cu&s;tom on &s;uch me|lancholy
Occa&s;ions, her Head at the &s;am&egrave; Time
turned another Way, as if reluctantly and
with Confu&s;ion &s;he granted this Favour.&mdash;
But after &s;tanding a Moment in this Po&s;ture,
and finding her Hand untouch'd, &s;he concluded
Grief had depriv'd him of his Sen&s;es, and that
he would &s;hortly fall into a Swoon as <HI>Thra&s;ime|des</HI>
did: And to prevent being a Witne&s;s of &s;o
doleful a Sight, &s;he hurry'd out of the Room
without once turning about, and having reach'd
her own Apartment, &s;unk into a Chair, not a
little affected with the deplorable Condition in
which &s;he had left her &s;uppos'd mi&s;erable Lover.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Contra&s;t continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Company &s;he had left behind her be|ing
all, except Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to the la&s;t
Degree &s;urpriz'd at her &s;trange Words and
<PB N="216" REF="218">
Actions, continued mute for &s;everal Minutes
after &s;he was gone, &s;taring upon one another,
as if each wi&s;h'd to know the other's Opinion
of &s;uch an unaccountable Behaviour. At la&s;t
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who ob&s;erved her Brother's Back
was towards her, told Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in a low
Voice, that &s;he hop'd he would call and take
his Leave of them before he &s;et out for the
Place where his De&s;pair would carry him.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> in &s;pite of his natural Gravity,
could not forbear laughing at this Speech of
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s, which &s;hock'd her Brother,
and not being able to &s;tay where <HI>Arabella</HI> was
ridicul'd, nor intitled to re&s;ent it, which would
have been a manife&s;t Inju&s;tice on that Occa&s;ion,
he retir'd to his own Apartment to give vent to
that Spleen which in tho&s;e Moments made him
out of Humour with all the World.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when he was gone, indulg'd
him&s;elf in a little Mirth on his Niece's Extra|vagance,
prote&s;ting he did not know what to do
with her. Upon which Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> ob&s;erv'd,
that it was a Pity there were not &s;uch Things
as Prote&s;tant Nunneries; giving it as her Opi|nion,
that her Cou&s;in ought to be confin'd in
one of tho&s;e Places, and never &s;uffer'd to &s;ee
any Company, by which Means &s;he would avoid
expo&s;ing her&s;elf in the Manner &s;he did now.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> who po&s;&s;ibly thought this a rea|&s;onable
Scheme of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s, &s;eem'd by
his Silence to a&s;&s;ent to her Opinion; but Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> was greatly di&s;pleas'd with his Daughter
for expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf &s;o freely; alledging that
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when &s;he was out of tho&s;e Whims,
was a very &s;en&s;ible young Lady, and &s;ometimes.
<PB N="217" REF="219">
talk'd as learnedly as a Divine. To which
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> al&s;o added, that &s;he had a great
Knowledge of Hi&s;tory, and had a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing
Memory; and after &s;ome more Di&s;|cour&s;e
to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, he took his Leave,
earne&s;tly entreating Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to believe that
he never entertain'd any De&s;ign of making his
Addre&s;&s;es to Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, that Lady after having
given near half an Hour to tho&s;e Reflexions
which occur to Heroines in the &s;ame Situation
with her&s;elf, called for <HI>Lucy,</HI> and order'd her
to go to the Dining-Room, and &s;ee in what
Condition Mr <HI>Selvin</HI> was, telling her &s;he had
certainly left him in a Swoon, as al&s;o the Oc|ca&s;ion
of it; and bid her give him all the Con|&s;olation
in her Power.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> with Tears in her Eyes at this Recital,
went down as &s;he was order'd, and entering the
Room without any Ceremony, her Thoughts
being wholly fix'd on the melancholy Circum|&s;tance
her Lady had been telling her; &s;he look'd
eagerly round the Room without &s;peaking a
Word, till Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
thought &s;he had been &s;ent with &s;ome Me&s;&s;age
from <HI>Arabella,</HI> ask'd her both at the &s;ame In|&s;tant,
What &s;he wanted?&mdash;</P>
<P>I came, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> repeating her Lady's
Words, to &s;ee in what Condition Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> is
in, and to give him all the Solation in my
Power.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> laughing heartily at this Speech,
ask'd her what &s;he could do for Mr. <HI>Selvin?</HI>
To which &s;he reply'd, &s;he did not know; but
<PB N="218" REF="220">
her Lady had told her to give him all the Sola|tion
in her Power.</P>
<P>Con&s;olation thou would'&s;t &s;ay, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid
Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy</HI> curte&s;ying. Well, Child,
added he, go up and tell your Lady, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>
does not need any Con&s;olation.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> accordingly return'd with this Me&s;&s;age,
and was met at the Chamber-Door by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who ha&s;tily ask'd her if Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> was reco|ver'd
from his Swoon: To which <HI>Lucy</HI> reply'd
that &s;he did not know; but that Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
bid her tell her Lady&s;hip, Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> did not
need any Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! cry'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> throwing her|&s;elf
into a Chair as pale as Death&mdash;He is dead,
he has fallen upon his Sword, and put an End
to his Life and Mi&s;eries at once&mdash;Oh! how un|happy
am I, cry'd &s;he, bur&s;ting into Tears, to
be the Cau&s;e of &s;o cruel an Accident&mdash;Was
ever any Fate &s;o terrible as mine&mdash;Was ever
Beauty &s;o fatal&mdash;Was ever Rigour &s;o unfortu|nate&mdash;How
will the Quiet of my future Days
be di&s;turbed by the &s;ad Remembrance of a Man
who&s;e Death was cau&s;ed by my Di&s;dain&mdash;But
why, re&s;um'd &s;he after a little Pau&s;e&mdash;Why do
I thus afflict my&s;elf for what has happen'd by an
unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity? Nor am I &s;ingular in
the Misfortune which has befallen me&mdash;Did not
the &s;ad <HI>Perinthus</HI> die for the beautiful <HI>Panthea</HI>&mdash;
Did not the Rigour of <HI>Bar&s;ina</HI> bring the mi&s;e|rable
<HI>Oxyatres</HI> to the Grave&mdash;And the Severity
of <HI>Statira</HI> make <HI>Oroondates</HI> fall upon his Sword
in her Pre&s;ence, tho' happily he e&s;cap'd being
kill'd by it&mdash;Let us then not afflict our&s;elves
<PB N="219" REF="221">
unrea&s;onably at this &s;ad Accident&mdash;Let us la|ment
as we ought the fatal Effects of our
Charms&mdash;But let us comfort our&s;elves with the
Thought that we have only acted conformable
to our Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having pronounc'd the&s;e la&s;t Words
with a &s;olemn and lofty Accent, order'd <HI>Lucy,</HI>
who li&s;ten'd to her with Eyes drown'd in Tears,
to go down and ask if the Body was remov'd&mdash;
for added &s;he, all my Con&s;tancy will not be
&s;ufficient to &s;upport me again&s;t that pitiful
Sight.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> accordinly deliver'd her Me&s;&s;age to
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who were &s;till
together, di&s;cour&s;ing on the fanta&s;tical Turn of
<HI>Arabella,</HI> when the Knight, who could not
po&s;&s;ibly comprehend what &s;he meant by asking
if the Body was removed, bid her tell her Lady
he de&s;ired to &s;peak with her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> upon receiving this Summons, &s;et
her&s;elf to con&s;ider what could be the Intent of
it. If Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> be dead, &s;aid &s;he, what Good
can my Pre&s;ence do among them? Surely it
cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity, that
my Uncle de&s;ires to &s;ee me&mdash;No, it would be
unju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e it. Que&s;tionle&s;s my unhappy
Lover is &s;till &s;truggling with the Pangs of Death,
and for a Con&s;olation in his la&s;t Moments, im|plores
the Favour of re&s;igning up his Life in my
Sight. Pau&s;ing a little at the&s;e Words, &s;he ro&s;e
from her Seat with a Re&s;olution to give the un|happy
<HI>Selvin</HI> her Pardon before he dy'd. Meet|ing
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> as he was returning from his
Chamber to the Dining-Room, &s;he told him,
&s;he hop'd the Charity &s;he was going to di&s;cover
<PB N="220" REF="222">
towards his Rival, would not give him any
Unea&s;ine&s;s; and preventing his Reply by going
ha&s;tily into the Room, he follow'd her dreading
&s;ome new Extravagance, yet not able to prevent
it, endeavour'd to conceal his Confu&s;ion from her
Ob&s;ervation&mdash;<HI>Arabella</HI> after breathing a gentle
Sigh told told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that &s;he was come to
grant Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> her Pardon for the Offence he
had been guilty of, that he might depart in
Peace.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> he is departed in
Peace without it.</P>
<P>How, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> is he dead
then already? Alas! why had he not the Satis|faction
of &s;eeing me before he expir'd, that his
Sould might have departed in Peace! He would
have been a&s;&s;ur'd not only of my Pardon, but
Pity al&s;o; and that A&s;&s;urance would have made
him happy in his la&s;t Moments.</P>
<P>Why, Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles</HI> &s;taring,
you &s;urprize me prodigiou&s;ly: Are you in
earne&s;t?</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s I am, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, nor ought you
to be &s;urpriz'd at the Concern I expre&s;s for the
Fate of this unhappy Man, nor at the Pardon I
propos'd to have granted him; &s;ince herein I am
ju&s;tified by the Example of many great and
virtuous Prince&s;&s;es, who have done as much,
nay, haply more than I intended to have done,
for Per&s;ons who&s;e Offences were greater than
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
to hear you talk in this Manner: 'Tis really
enough to make one &s;u&s;pect you are&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">
You do me great Inju&s;tice, Sir, interrupted

<P>Yes, upon my Soul, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville</HI>

<P>I am &s;orry for it, reply'd <HI>Arabella</HI> gravely,

Umbrage at <HI>Mandana</HI>'s Behaviour to the dying

there's no hearing this. Pardon me,
Madam, but upon my Soul, you'll make me
hang my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hang your&s;elf, repeated <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;ure you
know not what you &s;ay?&mdash;You meant, I &s;up|po&s;e,
that you'll fall upon your Sword. What
Hero ever threatned to give him&s;elf &s;o vulgar
a Death? But pray let me know the Cau&s;e of
your De&s;pair, &s;o &s;udden and &s;o violent.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> continuing in a &s;ort of &s;ullen
Silence, <HI>Arabella</HI> rai&s;ing her Voice went on:</P>
<P>Tho' I do not conceive my&s;elf oblig'd to give
you an Account of my Conduct, &s;eeing that I
have only permitted you yet to hope for my
Favour; yet I owe to my&s;elf and my own
<PB N="223" REF="225">
Honour the Ju&s;tification I am going to make.
Know then, that however &s;u&s;picious my Com|pa&s;&s;ion
for Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> may appear to your mi|&s;taken
Judgment, yet it has its Foundation
only in the Genero&s;ity of my Di&s;po&s;ition, which
inclines me to pardon the Fault when the un|happy
Criminal repents; and to afford him my
Pity when his Circum&s;tances require it. Let
not therefore the Charity I have di&s;cover'd to|wards
your Rival, be the Cau&s;e of your De|&s;pair,
&s;ince my Sentiments for him were he
living, would be what they were before; that
is, full of Indifference, nay, haply Di&s;dain.
And &s;uffer not your&s;elf to be &s;o carried away
by a violent and unju&s;t Jealou&s;y, as to threaten
your won Death, which if you really had any
Ground for your Su&s;picions, and truly lov'd me,
would come un&s;ought for, tho' not unde&s;ir'd&mdash;
For indeed, was your De&s;pair rea&s;onable, Death
would nece&s;&s;arily follow it; for what Lover can
live under &s;o de&s;perate a Misfortune. In that
Ca&s;e you may meet Death undauntedly when it
comes, nay, embrace it with Joy; but truly
the killing one's &s;elf is but a fal&s;e Picture of true
Courage, proceeding rather from Fear of a fur|ther
Evil, than Contempt of that you fly to:
For if it were a Contempt of Pain, the &s;ame
Principle would make you re&s;olve to bear pa|tiently
and fearle&s;ly all kind of Pains; and
Hope being of all other the mo&s;t contrary Thing
to Fear, this being an utter Bani&s;hment of Hope,
&s;eems to have its Ground in Fear.</P>

Confu&s;ion, went to her own Apartment,
follow'd by Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> to whom &s;he had
made a Sign for that Purpo&s;e; and throwing
her&s;elf into a Chair, bur&s;t into Tears, which
greatly &s;urprizing Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;he pre&s;t her
to tell her the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Alas! reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> have I not Cau&s;e to
think my&s;elf extremely unhappy? The deplo|rable
Death of Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> the De&s;pair to which
I &s;ee your Brother reduc'd, with the fatal Con|&s;equences

<P>Well, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> your Lady&s;hip
may make your&s;elf quite ea&s;y as to both the&s;e
Matters; for Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> is not dead, nor is my
Brother in De&s;pair that I know of.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay, Mi&s;s, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
is not Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> dead? Was the Wound he
gave him&s;elf not mortal then?</P>
<P>I know of no Wound that he gave him&s;elf,

Lord ble&s;s me, what &s;trange Thoughts come

<P>Truly I am rejoic'd to hear it, reply'd <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and in order to prevent the Effects of his
De&s;pair, I'll in&s;tantly di&s;patch my Commands
to him to live.</P>

I dare an&s;wer for his Obedience, Madam,

<P><HI>Arabella</HI> then gave Orders for Paper and Pens
to be brought her, and &s;eeing Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> en|ter
the Room, very formally acquainted him
with her Intention, telling him, that he ought
to be &s;atisfy'd with the Bani&s;hment to which
&s;he had doom'd his unhappy Rival, and not re|quire
his Death, &s;ince he and nothing to fear
from his Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
am perfectly ea&s;y upon that Account: And in
order to &s;pare you the Trouble of &s;ending to
Mr. <HI>Selvin,</HI> I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you that he
is in no Danger of dying.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> ac|cording
to the Nature of Things, 'tis impo&s;&s;i|ble
but he mu&s;t already be very near Death&mdash;
You know the Rigour of my Sentence, you
know&mdash;</P>
<P>I know, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that
Mr. <HI>Selvin</HI> does not think him&s;elf under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of obeying your Sentence; and has the
Impudence to que&s;tion your Authority for ba|ni&s;hing
him from his native Country.</P>
<P>My Authority, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;trangely
&s;urpriz'd, is founded upon the ab&s;olute Power
he has given me over him.</P>
<P>He denies that, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> and
&s;ays that he neither can give, nor you exerci&s;e
an ab&s;olute Power over him; &s;ince you are
both accountable to the King, who&s;e Subjects
you are, and both re&s;train'd by the Laws un|der
who&s;e Sanction you live.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s apparent Confu&s;ion at the&s;e Words
giving Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> Hopes that he had fallen
upon a proper Method to cure her of &s;ome of
her &s;trange Notions, he was going to pur&s;ue his
Arguments, when <HI>Arabella</HI> looking a little
&s;ternly upon him,</P>
<P>The Empire of Love, &s;aid &s;he, like the Em|pire
of Honour, is govern'd by Laws of its
own, which have no Dependence upon, or Re|lation
to any other.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> if I pre|&s;ume
to differ from you. Our Laws have fix'd
the Boundaries of Honour as well as tho&s;e of
Love.</P>
<P>How is that po&s;&s;ible, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> when
they differ &s;o widely, that a Man may be ju&s;ti|fy'd
by the one, and yet condemn'd by the
other? For In&s;tance, pur&s;ued &s;he, you are not
permitted by the Laws of the Land to take
away the Life of any Per&s;on whatever; yet the
Laws of Honour oblige you to hunt your Ene|my
thro' the World, in order to &s;acrifice him
to your Vengeance. Since it is impo&s;&s;ible then
for the &s;ame Actions to be at once ju&s;t and un|ju&s;t,
it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the Law
which condemns it, and that which ju&s;tifies it
is not the &s;ame, but directly oppo&s;ite&mdash;And
now, added &s;he, after a little Pau&s;e, I hope I
have entirely clear'd up that Point to you.</P>
<P>You have indeed, Madam, reply'd Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
proved to a Demon&s;tration, that what
is called Honour is &s;omething di&s;tinct from Ju|&s;tice,
&s;ince they command Things ab&s;olutely
oppo&s;ite to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">
<HI>Arabella</HI> without reflecting on this Inference,
went on to prove the independent Sovereignty
of Love, which, &s;aid &s;he, may be collected
from all the Words and Actions of tho&s;e Heroes
who were in&s;pir'd by this Pa&s;&s;ion. We &s;ee it

<P>Love requires a more unlimited Obedience
from its Slaves, than any other Monarch can
expect from his Subjects; an Obedience which
is circum&s;crib'd by no Laws whatever, and de|pendent
upon nothing but it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall live, Madam, &s;ays the renowned

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which is introduc'd a very &s;ingular
Character.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> who&s;e Envy and Di&s;like
of her lovely Cou&s;in was heighten'd by
her Su&s;picions that &s;he di&s;puted with her the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Heart, &s;he having
been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay
Gentleman, was extremely delighted with the
Ridicule her ab&s;urd Behaviour had drawn upon
her at <HI>Bath,</HI> which &s;he found by Enquiry was
thro' Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI>'s Repre&s;entation grown almo&s;t
general.</P>
<P>In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the
Publick Places un-eclips'd by the &s;uperior Beau|ty
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;he acquainted her Father and
Brother with Part of what &s;he had heard, which
determin'd them to prevent that young Lady's
Appearance in Publick while they &s;taid at <HI>Bath;</HI>
this being no difficult Matter to bring about,
&s;ince <HI>Arabella</HI> only went to the Rooms or Pa+rade
in Compliance with the Invitation of her
Cou&s;ins.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="231">
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> being by the&s;e Means rid of a
Rival too powerful even to contend with, went
with more than u&s;ual Gaiety to the A&s;&s;embly,
where the Extravagancies of <HI>Arabella</HI> afforded
a perpetual Fund for Diver&s;ion. Her more
than pa&s;&s;ive Behaviour upon this Occa&s;ion, ba|ni&s;hing
all Re&s;traint among tho&s;e &s;he convers'd
with, the Je&s;t circulated very freely at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Expence. Nor did Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> fail to give
new Poignancy to their Sarca&s;ms, by artfully
di&s;clo&s;ing the bent of her Cou&s;in's Studies, and
enumerating the many Ab&s;urdities they had
made her guilty of.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s uncommon Beauty had gain'd her
&s;o many Enemies among the Ladies that com|pos'd
this A&s;&s;embly, that they &s;eem'd to con|tend
with each other who &s;hould ridicule her
mo&s;t. The celebrated Counte&s;s of&mdash;be|ing
then at <HI>Bath,</HI> approach'd a Circle of the&s;e
fair Defamers, and li&s;tning a few Moments to
the contemptuous Je&s;ts they threw out again&s;t
the ab&s;ent Beauty, declar'd her&s;elf in her Fa|vour;
which in a Moment, &s;uch was the Force
of her univer&s;ally acknowledg'd Merit, and the
Deference always pay'd to her Opinion, &s;ilenc'd
every pretty Impertinent around her.</P>
<P>This Lady, who among her own Sex had no
Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Ea&s;e, was in|ferior
to very few of the other in Sen&s;e, Learn|ing,
and Judgment. Her Skill in Poetry,
Painting, and Mu&s;ick, tho' inconte&s;tably great,
was number'd among the lea&s;t of her Accom|pli&s;hments.
Her Candour, her Sweetne&s;s, her
Mode&s;ty and Benevolence, while they &s;ecur'd
her from the Darts of Envy, render'd her &s;u|perior
<PB N="230" REF="232">
to Prai&s;e, and made the one as unnece&s;|&s;ary
as the other ineffectual.</P>
<P>She had been a Witne&s;s of the Surprize
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s extraordinary Appearance had occa|&s;ion'd,
and &s;truck with that as well as the un|common
Charms of her Per&s;on, had pre&s;t near
her with &s;everal others of the Company, when
&s;he was di&s;cour&s;ing in the Manner we have re|lated.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on of the Counte&s;s's nice Di&s;cern|ment
could not fail of ob&s;erving the Wit and
Spirit, which tho' ob&s;cur'd, was not ab&s;o|lutely
hid under the Ab&s;urdity of her No|tions.
And this Di&s;covery adding E&s;teem to
the Compa&s;&s;ion &s;he felt for the fair Vi&s;ionary,
&s;he re&s;olv'd to re&s;cue her from the ill-natur'd
Raillery of her Sex; prai&s;ing therefore her
Under&s;tanding, and the Beauty of her Per&s;on
with a Sweetne&s;s and Genero&s;ity peculiar to
her&s;elf, &s;he accounted in the mo&s;t delicate
Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her
Notions, from her Studies, her Retirment, her
Ignorance of the World, and her lively Ima|gination.
And to abate the Keenne&s;s of their
Sarca&s;ms, acknowledg'd, that &s;he her&s;elf had
when very young, been deep read in Roman|ces;
and but for an early Acquaintance with
the World, and being directed to other Studies,
was likely to have been as much a Heroine as
Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' &s;he was &s;ecretly vex'd at
this Defence of her Cou&s;in, was however under
a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeming oblig'd to the Counte&s;s
for it: And that Lady expre&s;&s;ing a De&s;ire to be

re&s;pectfully offer'd to attend her Cou&s;in to her

declin'd, &s;aying, As Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was a Stranger,
&s;he would make her the fir&s;t Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> at her Return gave her Bro|ther
an Account of what had happen'd at the
A&s;&s;embly, and fill'd him with an inconceivable
Joy at the Counte&s;s's Intention. He had al|ways
been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's
Character, and flatter'd him&s;elf that the Con|ver&s;ation
of &s;o admirable a Woman would be
of the utmo&s;t U&s;e to <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>That very Night he mention'd her to his be|loved
Cou&s;in; and after enumerating all her
fine Qualities, declar'd that &s;he had already con|ceiv'd
a Friend&s;hip for her, and was &s;olicitous of
her Acquaintance.</P>
<P>I think my&s;elf extremely fortunate, replied
<HI>Arabella,</HI> in that I have (tho' que&s;tionle&s;s un|de&s;ervedly)
acquir'd the Amity of this lovely
Per&s;on; and I beg you, pur&s;ued &s;he to Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> to tell her, that I long with Impa|tience

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> only bow'd her Head in An|&s;wer

<P>You cannot imagine, lovely Stranger, &s;aid

gone to the farthe&s;t Part of the World to ren|der

have conde&s;cended to be&s;tow upon me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> &s;tar'd at this extraordinary Speech,

Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> look'd down, and bit his Nails

hers.</P>
<P>The Favour I have receiv'd from For|tune,

&s;o great, that I may rationally expect &s;ome ter|rible

diverting her&s;elf with his Cou&s;in's Singularities:
And Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was within a little of thinking
her as much out of the Way as his Niece.</P>
<P>Misfortunes, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> are too
often the Lot of excellent Per&s;ons like your&s;elf.
The &s;ublime&s;t among Mortals both for Beauty

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, that

may indeed ju&s;tly be rank'd among the
Number of unfortunate Per&s;ons, but &s;he can
by no means di&s;pute the melancholy Precedence
with the divine <HI>Cleopatra</HI>&mdash;For in fine, Madam,
what Evils did the Prince&s;s of <HI>Parthia</HI> &s;uffer
which the fair <HI>Cleopatra</HI> did not likewi&s;e en|dure,
and &s;ome of them haply in a greater De|gree?
If <HI>Eli&s;a</HI> by the tyrannical Authority of
the King her Father, &s;aw her&s;elf upon the Point
of becoming the Wife of a Prince &s;he dete&s;ted,
was not the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Antony,</HI> by
the more unju&s;tifiable Tyranny of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> likely
to be forced into the Arms of <HI>Tyberius,</HI> a proud
and cruel Prince, who was odious to the whole
World as well as to her? If <HI>Eli&s;a</HI> was for &s;ome
time in the Power of Pyrates, was not <HI>Cleo|patra</HI>
Captive to an inhuman King, who pre|&s;ented
his Sword to the fair Brea&s;t of that di|vine
Prince&s;s worthy the Adoration of the
whole Earth? And in fine, if <HI>Eli&s;a</HI> had the
Grief to &s;ee her dear <HI>Artaban</HI> impri&s;on'd by the
Order of <HI>Augu&s;tus, Cleopatra</HI> beheld with mor|tal
Agonies, her beloved <HI>Coriolanus</HI> inclos'd
amid&s;t the Guards of that enrag'd Prince, and
doom'd to a cruel Death.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, Madam, reply'd the Counte&s;s,
that the Misfortunes of both the&s;e Prince&s;&s;es
were very great, tho' as you have &s;hew'd me
with &s;ome Inequality: And when one reflects
upon the dangerous Adventures to which Per|&s;ons
<PB N="235" REF="237">
of their Quality were expos'd in tho&s;e
Times, one cannot help rejoicing that we live
in an Age in which the Cu&s;toms, Manners,
Habits, and Inclinations differ &s;o widely from
theirs, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch Adventures
&s;hould even happen.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;trange Alteration of Things, that
&s;ome People I dare &s;ay at pre&s;ent, cannot be per|&s;uaded
to believe there ever were Prince&s;&s;es wan|dering
thro' the World by Land and Sea in mean
Di&s;gui&s;es, carry'd away violently out of their Fa|ther's
Dominions by in&s;olent Lovers&mdash;Some
di&s;cover'd &s;leeping in Fore&s;ts, other Shipwreck'd
on de&s;olate I&s;lands, confin'd in Ca&s;tles, bound
in Chariots, and even &s;trugling amid&s;t the tem|pe&s;tuous
Waves of the Sea, into which they
had ca&s;t them&s;elves to avoid the brutal Force of
their-Ravi&s;hers. Not one of the&s;e Things hav|ing
happen'd within the Compa&s;s of &s;everal
thou&s;and Years, People unlearn'd in Antiquity
would be apt to deem them idle Tales, &s;o im|probable
do they appear at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' greatly &s;urpriz'd at this Di&s;|cour&s;e,
did not think proper to expre&s;s her
Thoughts of it. She was unwilling to appear
ab&s;olutely ignorant of the pre&s;ent Cu&s;toms of
the World, before a Lady who&s;e good Opinion
&s;he was ardently de&s;irous of improving. Her
Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the Counte&s;s made
her receive the new Delights &s;he held out to her
with Re&s;pect, tho' not without Doubt and Ir|re&s;olution.
Her Blu&s;hes, her Silence, and
down-ca&s;t Eyes gave the Counte&s;s to under&s;tand
Part of her Thoughts; who for fear of alarm|ing
her too much for that Time, dropt the
<PB N="236" REF="238">
Subject, and turning the Conver&s;ation on others
more general, gave <HI>Arabella</HI> an Opportunity of
mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity
which was natural to her when Romances
were out of the Que&s;tion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which if the Reader has not antici|pated
it, he will find an Explanation
of &s;ome &s;eeming Incon&s;i&s;tencies in the
foregoing Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Counte&s;s, charm'd with the Wit
and good Sen&s;e of <HI>Arabella,</HI> could not
conceal her Admiration, but expre&s;t it in Terms
the mo&s;t obligingly imaginable: And <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who was exce&s;&s;ively delighted with her, return'd
the Compliments &s;he made her with the mo&s;t
re&s;pectful Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e mutual Civilities,
<HI>Arabella</HI> in the Style of Romance, intreated
the Counte&s;s to favour her with the Recital of
her Adventures.</P>
<P>At the Mention of this Reque&s;t, that Lady
convey'd &s;o much Confu&s;ion into her Counte|nance,
that <HI>Arabella</HI> extremely embarra&s;s'd by
it, tho' &s;he knew not why, thought it nece&s;|&s;ary
to apologize for the Di&s;turbance &s;he &s;eem'd
to have occa&s;ion'd in her.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, reply'd the Counte&s;s
recovering her&s;elf, if the uncommone&s;s of your
Reque&s;t made a Moment's Reflexion nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="237" REF="239">
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span"> that a young Lady of your
Sen&s;e and Delicacy could mean no Offence to
Decorum by making it. The Word Adven|tures
carries in it &s;o free and licentious a Sound
in the Apprehen&s;ions of People at this Period
of Time, that it can hardly with Propriety be
apply'd to tho&s;e few and natural Incidents which
compo&s;e the Hi&s;tory of a Woman of Honour.
And when I tell you, pur&s;ued &s;he with a Smile,
that I was born and chri&s;ten'd, had a u&s;eful
and proper Education, receiv'd the Addre&s;&s;es of
my Lord&mdash;through the Recommendation
of my Parents, and marry'd him with their
Con&s;ents and my own Inclination; and that
&s;ince we have liv'd in great Harmony together,
I have told you all the material Pa&s;&s;ages of my
Life, which upon Enquiry you will find differ
very little from tho&s;e of other Women of the
&s;ame Rank, who have a moderate Share of
Sen&s;e, Prudence and Virtue.</P>
<P>Since you have already, Madam, replied
<HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;hing, excus'd me for the Liberty
I took with you, it will be un-nece&s;&s;ary to tell
you it was grounded upon the Cu&s;toms of an|tient
Times, when Ladies of the highe&s;t Rank
and &s;ublime&s;t Virtue, were often expos'd to a
Variety of cruel Adventures which they im|parted
in Confidence to each other, when
Chance brought them together.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom, &s;aid the Counte&s;s &s;miling, changes the
very Nature of Things, and what was honour|able
a thou&s;and Years ago, may probably be look'd
upon as infamous now&mdash;A Lady in the heroick
Age you &s;peak of, would not be thought to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
any great Share of Merit, if &s;he had not
<PB N="238" REF="240">
been many times carried away by one or other
of her in&s;olent Lovers: Whereas a Beauty in
this could not pa&s;s thro' the Hands of &s;everal
different Ravi&s;hers, without bringing an Impu|tation
on her Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Actions which made a Man a
Hero in tho&s;e Times, would con&s;titute him a
Murderer in The&s;e&mdash;And the &s;ame Steps which
led him to a Throne Then, would infallibly
conduct him to a Scaffold Now.</P>
<P>But Cu&s;tom, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> cannot
po&s;&s;ibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice:
And &s;ince Virtue is the chief Characteri&s;tick of
a Hero, a Hero in the la&s;t Age will be a Hero
in this&mdash;Tho' the Natures of Virtue or Vice
cannot be changed, replied the Counte&s;s, yet
they may be mi&s;taken; and different Princi|ples,
Cu&s;toms, and Education, may probably
change their Names, if not their Natures.</P>
<P>Sure, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> a little moved,
you do not intend by this Inference to prove
<HI>Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Juba, Artaban,</HI> and the
other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men?</P>
<P>Judging them by the Rules of Chri&s;tianity,
and our pre&s;ent Notions of Honour, Ju&s;tice,
and Humanity, they certainly are, replied the
Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Did they not po&s;&s;e&s;s all the nece&s;&s;ary Quali|fications
of Heroes, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> and
each in a &s;uperlative Degree?&mdash;Was not their
Valour invincible, their Genero&s;ity unbounded,
and their Fidelity inviolable?</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, but
that their Valour was invincible; and many
thou&s;and Men le&s;s courageous than them&s;elves,
<PB N="239" REF="241">
felt the fatal Effects of that invincible Valour,
which was perpetually &s;eeking after Occa&s;ions
to exert it&s;elf. <HI>Oroondates</HI> gave many extraor|dinary
Proofs of that unbounded Genero&s;ity &s;o
natural to the Heroes of his Time. This Prince
being &s;ent by the King his Father, at the Head
of an Army, to oppo&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarch,
who had unju&s;tly invaded his Dominions, and
was de&s;troying the Lives and Properties of his
Subjects; having taken the Wives and Daugh|ters
of his Enemy Pri&s;oners, had by the&s;e Means
an Opportunity to put a Period to a War &s;o
de&s;tructive to his Country: Yet out of a Ge|nero&s;ity
truly heroick, he releas'd them imme|diately
without any Conditions; and falling in
Love with one of tho&s;e Prince&s;&s;es, &s;ecietly
quitted his Father's Court, re&s;ided &s;everal Years
in that of the Enemy of his Father and Coun|try,
engag'd him&s;elf to his Daughter, and when
the War broke out again between the two
Kings, fought furiou&s;ly again&s;t an Army in
which the King his Father was in Per&s;on, and
&s;hed the Blood of his future Subjects without
Remor&s;e; tho' each of tho&s;e Subjects, we are
told, would have &s;acrific'd his Life to &s;ave that
of their Prince, &s;o much was he belov'd&punc;
Such are the Actions which immortalize the
Heroes of Romance, and are by the Authors
of tho&s;e Books &s;tyl'd glorious, godlike, and di|vine.
Yet judging of them as Chri&s;tians, we
&s;hall find them impious and ba&s;e, and directly
oppo&s;ite to our pre&s;ent Notions of moral and re|lative
Duties.</P>
<P>'Tis certain therefore, Madam, added the
Conte&s;s with a Smile, that what was Virtue in
<PB N="240" REF="242">
tho&s;e Days, is Vice in ours: And to form a
Hero according to our Notions of 'em at pre|&s;ent,
'tis ne&s;&s;ary to give him Qualities very dif|ferent
from <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ecret Charm in the Countenance, Voice,
and Manner of the Counte&s;s, join'd to the
Force of her rea&s;oning, could not fail of mak|ing
&s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on the Mind of <HI>Arabella;</HI>
but it was &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion as came far &s;hort
of Conviction. She was &s;urpriz'd embarra&s;s'd,
perplex'd, but not convinc'd. Heroi&s;m, roman|tick
Heroi&s;m, was deeply rooted in her Heart;
it was her Habit of thinking, a Principle im|bib'd
from Education. She could not &s;eparate
her Ideas of Glory, Virtue, Courage, Gene|ro&s;ity,
and Honour, from the fal&s;e Repre&s;enta|tions
of them in the Actions of <HI>Oroondates,
Juba, Artaxerxes,</HI> and the re&s;t of the imaginary
Heroes. The Counte&s;s's Di&s;cour&s;e had rais'd a
Kind of Tumult in her Thoughts, which gave
an Air of Perplexity to her lovely Face, and
made that Lady apprehen&s;ive &s;he had gone too
far, and lo&s;t that Ground in her E&s;teem, which
&s;he had endeavour'd to acquire by a Conformity
to &s;ome of her Notions and Language. In this
however, &s;he was mi&s;taken; <HI>Arabella</HI> felt a
Tenderne&s;s for her that had already the Force of
a long contracted Friend&s;hip, and an E&s;teem
little le&s;s than Veneration.</P>
<P>When the Counte&s;s took Leave, the Profe&s;|sions
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' deliver'd in the Language
of Romance, were very &s;incere and affecting,
and were return'd with an equal Degree of
Tenderne&s;s by the Counte&s;s, who had conceiv'd
a more than ordinary Affection for her.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="243">
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> who could have almo&s;t wor|&s;hip'd
the Counte&s;s for the generous De&s;ign be
&s;aw &s;he had entertain'd, took an Opportunity
as he handed her to her Chair, to intreat in a
Manner as earne&s;tly as polite, that &s;he would

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which concludes Book the Eighth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville</HI> at his Return to the Dining-Room,
finding <HI>Arabella</HI> retir'd, told his
Father in a Rapture of Joy, that the charming
Counte&s;s would certainly make a Convert of
Lady <HI>Bella.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks, &s;aid the Baronet, &s;he has as &s;trange
Whims in her Head as my Niece. Ad's-heart,
what a deal of Stuff did &s;he talk about! A
Parcel of Heroes as &s;he calls them, with con|founded
hard Names&mdash;In my Mind &s;he is more
likely to make Lady <HI>Bella</HI> wor&s;e than better.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> a little vex'd at his Father's
Mi&s;-apprehen&s;ion, endeavour'd with as much
Delicacy as he could, to &s;et him right with Re|gard
to the Counte&s;s; &s;o that he brought him
at la&s;t to confe&s;s &s;he manag'd the Thing very
well.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, who had re&s;olv'd to take
<HI>Arabella</HI> openly into her Protection, was think|ing
on Means to engage her to appear at the

A&s;&s;embly, whither &s;he propos'd to accompany
her in a modern Dre&s;s. But her good Intenti|ons
towards our lovely Heroine were &s;u&s;pended
by the Account &s;he receiv'd of her Mother's
Indi&s;po&s;ition, which commanded her immedi|ate
Attendance on her at her Seat in&mdash;</P>
<P>Her &s;udden Departure gave <HI>Arabella</HI> an ex|treme
Unea&s;ine&s;s, and proved a cruel Di&s;ap|pointment
to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had founded
all his Hopes of her Recovery on the Conver|&s;ation
of that Lady.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> having Affairs that requir'd his
Pre&s;ence in <HI>London,</HI> propos'd to his Niece the
leaving <HI>Bath</HI> in a few Days, to which &s;he con|&s;ented;
and accordingly they &s;et out for <HI>Lon|don</HI>
in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Coach and Six, attended by
&s;everal Servants on Hor&s;eback, her Women
having been &s;ent away before in the Stage.</P>
<P>Nothing very remarkable happen'd during
this Journey, &s;o we &s;hall not trouble our Read|ers

&s;uch as her &s;uppo&s;ing a neat Country Girl who

her Re&s;cue; which occa&s;ion'd &s;ome
little Debate between her and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who
could not be per&s;uaded to believe it was as &s;he

&s;he does not &s;uit my Ta&s;te&mdash;She is very par|ticular
in a great many Things, and knows too

She hates Cards, keeps no A&s;&s;embly, is &s;een but
&s;eldom at Publick Places; and in my Opinion,
as well as in a great many others, is the dulle&s;t

at a Vi&s;it a little before I went down to your

As her Romances had long familiariz'd her
Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magni|ficence,
&s;he was not &s;o much &s;truck as might

in the Park, and where they celebrated the Ju&s;ts
and Tournaments.</P>
<P>The Sea&s;on for <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI> being not yet over,
&s;he was de&s;irous of once &s;eeing a Place, which
by the De&s;cription &s;he had heard of it, greatly
re&s;embled the Gardens of <HI>Lucullus</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> in
which the Emperor, with all the Princes and
Prince&s;&s;es of his Court were &s;o nobly entertain'd,
and where &s;o many gallant Conver&s;ations had
pa&s;s'd among tho&s;e admirable Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Singularity of her Dre&s;s, for &s;he was
cover'd with her Veil, drew a Number of
Gazers after her, who pre&s;t round her with &s;o
little Re&s;pect, that &s;he was greatly embarra&s;s'd,
and had Thoughts of quitting the Place, de|lightful
as &s;he own'd it, immediately, when her
Attention was wholly engro&s;s'd by an Adven|ture
in which &s;he &s;oon intere&s;ted her&s;elf very
deeply.</P>
<P>An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had
brought his Mi&s;tre&s;s di&s;guis'd in a Suit of Man's
or rather Boy's Cloaths, and a Hat and Fea|ther,
into the Gardens. The young Creature
being a little intoxicated with the Wine &s;he had
taken too freely, was thrown &s;o much off her
<PB N="248" REF="250">
Guard as to give Occa&s;ion to &s;ome of the Com|pany
to &s;u&s;pect her Sex; and a gay Fellow, in
order to give them &s;ome Diver&s;ion at her Ex|pence,
pretending to be affronted at &s;omething
&s;he &s;aid, drew his Sword upon the di&s;guis'd Fair
One, which &s;o alarm'd her, that &s;he &s;hriek'd
out, She was a Woman, and ran for Protection
to her Lover, who was &s;o di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rder'd with Liquor,
that he was not able to defend her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> ever curious and inqui&s;itive,
demanded the Cau&s;e why the Company ran in
Crouds to that particular Spot; and receiv'd
for An&s;wer, That a Gentleman had drawn his
Sword upon a Lady di&s;guis'd in a Man's Habit.</P>
<P>Oh Heav'ns! cry'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> this mu&s;t cer|tainly
be a very notable Adventure. The Lady
has doubtle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary Circum&s;tances
in her Story, and haply upon Enquiry, her Mis|fortunes
will be found to re&s;emble tho&s;e which
oblig'd the beautiful <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> to put on the &s;ame
Di&s;gui&s;e, who was by that Means murder'd by
the cruel <HI>Zenodorus</HI> in a Fit of Jealou&s;y at the
Amity his Wife expre&s;t for her. But can I
not &s;ee this unfortunate Fair One, added &s;he,
pre&s;&s;ing in &s;pite of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Intreaties
thro' the Croud&mdash;I may haply be able to afford
her &s;ome Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> finding his Per&s;ua&s;ions were
not regarded, follow'd her with very little Dif|ficulty:
For her Veil falling back in her Hurry,
&s;he did not mind to replace it, and the Charms
of her Face, join'd to the Maje&s;ty of her Per|&s;on,
and Singularity of her Dre&s;s, attracting
every Per&s;on's Attention and Re&s;pect, they
made Way for her to pa&s;s, not a little &s;urpriz'd
<PB N="249" REF="251">
at the extreme Earne&s;tne&s;s and Solemnity that
appear'd in her Countenance upon an Event &s;o
diverting to every one el&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;guis'd Lady whom &s;he was endea|vouring
to approach, had thrown her&s;elf upon
a Bench in one of the Boxes, trembling &s;till
with the Apprehen&s;ion of the Sword, tho' her
Antagoni&s;t was kneeling at her Feet, making
Love to her in Mock-Heroicks for the Diver|&s;ion
of the Company.</P>
<P>Her Hat and Peruke had fallen off in her
Fright, and her Hair which had been turn'd
up under it, hung now loo&s;ely about her Neck,
and gave &s;uch an Appearance of Woe to a Face,
which notwith&s;tanding the Palene&s;s that Terror
had over&s;pread it with, was really extremely
pretty, that <HI>Arabella</HI> was equally &s;truck with
Compa&s;&s;ion and Admiration of her.</P>
<P>Lovely Unknown, &s;aid &s;he to her with an
Air of extreme Tenderne&s;s, tho' I am a Stran|ger
both to your Name and Hi&s;tory, yet your
A&s;pect per&s;uading me your Quality is not mean,
and the Condition and Di&s;gui&s;e in which I be|hold
you, &s;hewing that you are Unfortunate, per|mit
me to offer you all the A&s;&s;i&s;tances in my Pow|er,
&s;eeing that I am mov'd thereto by my Com|pa&s;&s;ion
for your Di&s;tre&s;s, and that E&s;teem which
the Sight of you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was &s;truck dumb with Confu|&s;ion
at this &s;trange Speech, and at the Whi&s;pers
and Scoffs it occa&s;ion'd among the Spectators. He
attempted to take hold of her Hand in order to
lead her away, but &s;he di&s;engag'd her&s;elf from
him with a Frown of Di&s;plea&s;ure; and taking
no Notice of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who whi&s;per'd
<PB N="250" REF="252">
with great Emotion, Lord, Cou&s;in, how you
expo&s;e your&s;elf! pre&s;t nearer to the Beautiful
Di&s;guis'd, and again repeated her Offers of
Service.</P>
<P>The Girl being perfectly recover'd from her
Intoxication by the Fright &s;he had been in, gaz'd
upon <HI>Arabella</HI> with a Look of extreme Sur|prize:
Yet being mov'd to re&s;pect by the Dig|nity
of her Appearance, and &s;trange as her
Words &s;eem'd to be by the obliging Purport of
them, and the affecting Earne&s;tne&s;s with which
they were deliver'd, &s;he ro&s;e from her Seat and
thank'd her, with an Accept full of Regard
and Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fair Maid, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> taking her Hand,
let us quit this Place, where your Di&s;covery
may probably &s;ubject you to more Dangers: If
you will be pleas'd to put your&s;elf into my Pro|tection,
and acquaint me with the Hi&s;tory of
your Mi&s;fortunes; I have Intere&s;t enough with
a valiant Per&s;on who &s;hall undertake to free you
from your Per&s;ecutions, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the

<P>The kneeling Hero, who as well as every
one el&s;e that were pre&s;ent, had gaz'd with A&s;to|ni&s;hment
at <HI>Arabella</HI> during all this Pa&s;&s;age,
perceiving &s;he was about to rob him of the di&s;|guis'd
Fair, &s;eiz'd hold of the Hand &s;he had at
Liberty, and &s;wore he would not part with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> almo&s;t mad with Vexation,
endeavour'd to get <HI>Arabella</HI> away.</P>
<P>Are you mad, Madam, &s;aid he in a Whi&s;per,
to make all this Rout about a Pro&s;titute? Do

<P><PB N="251" REF="253">
What, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella</HI> in a Rage, Are
you ba&s;e enough to leave this admirable Crea|ture
in the Power of that Man, who is que|&s;tionle&s;s
her Ravi&s;her; and will you not draw
your Sword in her Defence?</P>
<P>Hey day! cry'd the Sea-Officer, wak'd out of
his &s;tupid Do&s;e by the Clamour about him: What's
the Matter here&mdash;What are you doing? Where's
my <HI>Lucy?</HI> Zoons! Sir, &s;aid he to the young
Fellow who held her, What Bu&s;ine&s;s have you
with my <HI>Lucy?</HI> And uttering a dreadful Oath,
drew out his Sword, and &s;tagger'd towards his
gay Rival, who ob&s;erving the Weakne&s;s of his
Antagoni&s;t, flouri&s;h'd with his Sword to &s;hew
his Courage and frighten the Ladies, who all
ran away &s;creaming. <HI>Arabella</HI> taking Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville</HI> under the Arm, cried out to Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> as &s;he left the Place, to take Care of
the di&s;tre&s;s'd Lady, and while the two Comba|tants
were di&s;puting for her, to carry her away
in Safety.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> without regarding this In|junction,
ha&s;ten'd after her; and to pacify her,
told her the Lady was re&s;cu'd by her favourite
Lover, and carry'd off in Triumph.</P>
<P>But are you &s;ure, &s;aid <HI>Aabella,</HI> it was not
&s;ome other of her Ravi&s;hers who carry'd her
away, and not the Per&s;on whom &s;he has haply
favour'd with her Affection? May not the &s;ame
Thing have happen'd to her, as did to the beau|tiful
<HI>Candace,</HI> Queen of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> who while
two of her Ravi&s;hers were fighting for her, a
third whom &s;he took for her Deliverer, came
and carry'd her away.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="254">
But &s;he went away willingly, I a&s;&s;ure you,
Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville:</HI> Pray don't be in
any Concern about her&mdash;</P>
<P>If &s;he went away willingly with him, reply'd
<HI>Arabella,</HI> 'tis probable it may not be another
Ravi&s;her: And yet if this Per&s;on that re&s;cu'd
her happen'd to be in Armour, and the Vizor
of his Helmet down, &s;he might be mi&s;taken as

<P>Well, well, he was not in Armour, Madam,

<P>You &s;eem to be di&s;turb'd, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI>
a little &s;urpriz'd at his peevi&s;h Tone: Is there
any Thing in this Adventure which concerns
you? Nay, now I remember, you did not of|fer
to defend the Beautiful Unknown. I am
not willing to impute your In-action upon &s;uch
an Occa&s;ion, to Want of Courage or Genero|&s;ity;
perhaps you are acquainted with her Hi|&s;tory,

in her Defence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> perceiving the Company gather
from all Parts to the Walk they were in, told
her he would acquaint her with all he knew
concerning the di&s;guis'd Lady when they were
in the Coach on their Return Home; and <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
impatient for the promis'd Story, propos'd
to leave the Gardens immediately, which was

<P>AS &s;oon as they were &s;eated in the Coach &s;he
did not fail to call upon him to perform
his Promi&s;e: But Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively out
of Humour at her expo&s;ing her&s;elf in the Gar|dens,
reply'd, without con&s;idering whether he
&s;huld not offend her, That he knew no more
of the di&s;guis'd Lady than any body el&s;e in the
Place.</P>
<P>How, Sir, reply'd <HI>Arabella,</HI> Did you not
promi&s;e to relate her Adventures to me? And
would you have me believe you knew no more
of them than the re&s;t of the Cavaliers and La|dies

<P>Upon my Soul, I don't, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glan|ville;</HI>
yet what I know of her is &s;ufficient to

<P>She cannot &s;ure be more indi&s;creet than the

who like her put on Man's Apparel, through
De&s;pair at the ill Succe&s;s of her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Alex|ander</HI>
&mdash;And certain it is, that tho' the beautiful
<HI>Hermione</HI> was guilty of one great Error which
lo&s;t her the E&s;teem of <HI>Alexander,</HI> yet &s;he had a
high and noble Soul; as was manife&s;t by her
Behaviour and Words when &s;he was run thro'

&s;he, as &s;he was falling, how &s;weet do I find

<P>Do you pity the unhappy <HI>Hermione,</HI> Sir? &s;aid
<HI>Arabella</HI> interpreting his Exclamation her own

And if the bare Recital of the Words

<P><PB N="255" REF="257">
To this Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> made no other An|&s;wer

&s;he was ab&s;olutely mad, and held a &s;hort Debate
with him&s;elf, Whether he ought not to bring
a Commi&s;&s;ion of Lunacy again&s;t her, rather
than marry her to his Son, whom he was per|&s;uaded
could never be happy with a Wife &s;o un|accountably
ab&s;urd. Tho' he only hinted at
this to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> in a Conver&s;ation he had
with him while his Di&s;&s;atisfaction was at its
Height, concerning <HI>Arabella,</HI> yet the bare Sup|po&s;ition
that his Father ever thought of &s;uch a
Thing, threw the young Gentleman into &s;uch
Agonies, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to compo&s;e him, pro|te&s;ted
he would do nothing in relation to his
Niece that he would not approve of. Yet he
expo&s;tulated with him on the Ab&s;urdity of her
Behaviour, and the Ridicule to which &s;he ex|pos'd
her&s;elf wherever &s;he went; appealing to
him, whether in a Wife he could think tho&s;e
Follies &s;upportable, which in a Mi&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ion'd
him &s;o much Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as much in Love as he was,
felt all the Force of this Inference, and acknow|ledg'd
to his Father, That he could not think
of marrying <HI>Arabella,</HI> till the Whims her Ro|mances
<PB N="256" REF="258">
had put into her Head, were craz'd by
a better Knowledge of Life and Manners. But
he added with a Sigh, That he knew not how
this Reformation would be effected; for &s;he

Incident to her own fanta&s;tick Ideas, that every

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which Arabella meets with another
admirable Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR lovely Heroine had not been above a
Fortnight in <HI>London,</HI> before the gro&s;s Air
of that &s;moaky Town affected her Health &s;o
much, that Sir <HI>Charles</HI> propos'd to her to go for
a few Weeks to <HI>Richmond,</HI> where he hir'd a
Hou&s;e elegantly furni&s;h'd for her Reception.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> had been too long out of that
darling City, to pay her the Compliment of at|tending
her con&s;tantly at <HI>Richmond;</HI> yet &s;he
promis'd to be as often as po&s;&s;ible with her: And
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> having Affaris that could not di&s;|pen&s;e
with his Ab&s;ence from town, plac'd his
Steward in her Hou&s;e, being a Per&s;on who&s;e
Prudence and Fidelity he could rely upon; and
he, with her Women, and two or three other
menial Servants, made up her Equipage.</P>
<P>As it was not con&s;i&s;tent with Decorum for
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to re&s;ide in her Hou&s;e, he con|tented
him&s;elf with riding to <HI>Richmond</HI> generally
<PB N="257" REF="259">
every Day: And as long as <HI>Arabella</HI> was pleas'd
with that Retirement, he re&s;olv'd not to
pre&s;s her Return to Town till the Counte&s;s
of&mdash;arriv'd, in who&s;e Conver&s;ation he
grounded all his Hopes of her Cure.</P>
<P>At that Sea&s;on of the Year <HI>Richmond</HI> not
being quite de&s;erted by Company, <HI>Arabella</HI> was
vi&s;ited by &s;everal Ladies of Fa&s;hion; who
charm'd with her Affability, Politene&s;s, and
good Sen&s;e, were &s;trangely perplex'd how to ac|count
for &s;ome Peculiarities in her Dre&s;s and
Manner of thinking.</P>
<P>Some of the younger Sort from whom <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
extraordinary Beauty took away all Preten&s;ions
to Equality on that Score, made them&s;elves ex|tremely
merry with her Oddne&s;&s;es, as they call'd
them, and gave broad Intimations that her
Head was not right.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Ta&s;te was as delicate,
Sentiments as refin'd, and Judgment as clear as
any Per&s;on's could be who believ'd the Authen|ticity
of <HI>Scudery</HI>'s Romances, &s;he was &s;trange|ly
di&s;appointed to find no Lady with whom &s;he
could conver&s;e with any tolerable Plea&s;ure: And
that in&s;tead of <HI>Clelia</HI>'s, <HI>Statira</HI>'s <HI>Mandana</HI>'s, &amp;c.
&s;he found only Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> among all &s;he
knew.</P>
<P>The Compari&s;on &s;he drew between &s;uch as
the&s;e and the charming Counte&s;s of&mdash;whom
&s;he had ju&s;t begun to be acquainted with at <HI>Bath,</HI>
increas'd her Regret for the Interruption that
was given to &s;o agreeable a Friend&s;hip: And it
was with infinite Plea&s;ure Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> heard
her repeatedly wi&s;h for the Arrival of that admi|rable
Lady (as &s;he always call'd her) in Town.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="260">
Not being able to reli&s;h that in&s;ipid Conver|&s;ation
of the young Ladies that vi&s;ited her at
<HI>Richmond,</HI> her chief Amu&s;ement was to walk in
the Park there; which becau&s;e of its Rural Priva|cy,
was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations.</P>
<P>Here &s;he indulg'd Contemplation, leaning on
the Arm of her faithful <HI>Lucy,</HI> while her other
Women walk'd at &s;ome Di&s;tance behind her, and
two Men Servants kept her always in Sight.</P>
<P>One Evening when &s;he was returning from
her u&s;ual Walk, &s;he heard the Sound of a Wo|man's
Voice, which &s;eem'd to proceed from a
Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View.
And &s;topping a Moment, di&s;tingui&s;h'd &s;ome
plaintive Accents, which increa&s;ing her Curio|&s;ity,
&s;he advanc'd towards the Place, telling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;he was re&s;olv'd if po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover
who the di&s;tre&s;s'd Lady was, and what was the
Subject of her Affliction.</P>
<P>As &s;he drew nearer with &s;oftly treading Steps,
&s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h through the Branches of
the Trees, now de&s;poil'd of great part of their
Leaves, two Women &s;eated on the Ground,
their Backs towards her, and one of them with
her Head gently reclin'd on the other's Shoulder,
&s;eem'd by her mournful Action to be weeping;
for &s;he often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes,
breathing every Time a Sigh, which, as <HI>Arabella</HI>
phras'd it, &s;eem'd to proceed from the deepe&s;t
Rece&s;&s;es of her Heart.</P>
<P>This Adventure, more worthy indeed to be
&s;tyl'd an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine
had ever yet met with, and &s;o conformable to
what &s;he had read in Romances, fill'd her Heart
with eager Expectation. She made a Sign to
<PB N="259" REF="261">
<HI>Lucy</HI> to make no Noi&s;e, and creeping &s;till clo&s;er
towards the Place where this afflicted Per&s;on
&s;at, &s;he heard her di&s;tinctly utter the&s;e Words,
which however were often interrupted with her
Sighs.</P>
<P>Ah! <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> whom I to my Misfortune
have too much loved, and whom to my Mis|fortune
I fear I &s;hall never &s;ufficiently hate,
&s;ince that Heav'n and thy cruel Ingratitude hath
ordain'd that thou &s;halt never be mine, and that
&s;o many &s;weet and dear Hopes are for ever
taken from me, return me at lea&s;t, ungrateful
Man, return me tho&s;e Te&s;timonies of my in|nocent
Affection, which were &s;ometimes &s;o
dear and precious to thee. Return me tho&s;e
Favours, which all innocent as they were, are
become Criminal by thy Crime. Return me,
Cruel Man, return me tho&s;e Reliques of my
Heart which thou detaine&s;t in De&s;pight of me,
and which, notwith&s;tanding thy Infidelity, I
cannot recover.</P>
<P>Here her Tears interrupting her Speech,
<HI>Arabella</HI> being impatient to know the Hi&s;tory
of this afflicted Per&s;on, came &s;oftly round to
the other Side, and &s;hewing her&s;elf, occa&s;ion'd
&s;ome Di&s;turbance to the &s;ad Unknown; who
ri&s;ing from her Seat, with her Face averted, as
if a&s;ham'd of having &s;o far di&s;clos'd her Sor|rows
in a Stranger's Hearing, endeavour'd to
pa&s;s by her un-notic'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which is related the Hi&s;tory of the
Prince&s;s of Gaul.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY Name, Madam, is <HI>Cynccia,</HI> my Birth
Illu&s;trious enough, &s;eeing that I am the
Daughter of a Sovereign Prince, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
a large and &s;pacious Territory in what is now
called Antient <HI>Gaul.</HI></P>
<P>What, Madam, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> Are
you a Prince&s;s then?</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s I am, Madam, replied the La|dy;
and a Prince&s;s happy and pro&s;perous, till
the Felicity of my Life was interrupted by the
perfidious <HI>Ariamenes.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI>
again, that my Ignorance of your Quality
made me be deficient in tho&s;e Re&s;pects which
are due to your high Birth, and which notwith|&s;tanding
tho&s;e Characters of Greatne&s;s I might
read in the Lineaments of your Vi&s;age, I yet
neglected to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">y&mdash;</P>
<P>Alas! Madam, &s;aid the Stranger, that little
Beauty which the Heavens be&s;tow'd on me
only to make me wretched, as by the Event it
has proved, has long &s;ince taken its Flight, and
together with my Happine&s;s, I have lo&s;t that
which made me Unhappy. And certain it is,
Grief has made &s;uch Ravages among what might
once have been thought tolerable in my Face,
that I &s;hould not be &s;urpriz'd if my being no
longer Fair, &s;hould make you with Difficulty
believe I ever was &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">
<HI>Arabella</HI> after a proper Compliment in An|&s;wer
to this Speech, intreated the Prince&s;s to go
on with her Hi&s;tory, who he&s;itating a little,
comply'd with her Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Be pleas'd to know then, Madam, &s;aid &s;he,
that being bred up with all imaginable Tender|ne&s;s
in my Father's Court, I had no &s;ooner
arriv'd to my Sixteenth Year than I &s;aw my&s;elf
&s;urrounded with Lovers; who neverthele&s;s,
&s;uch was the Severity with which I behav'd
my&s;elf, conceal'd their Pa&s;&s;ions under a re&s;pect|ful
Silence, well knowing Bani&s;hment from my
Pre&s;ence was the lea&s;t Puni&s;hment they had to
expect, if they pre&s;um'd to declare their Senti|ments
to me.</P>
<P>I liv'd in this Fa&s;hion, Madam, for Two
Years longer, rejoicing in the In&s;en&s;ibility of
my own Heart, and triumphing in the Suffer|ings
of others, when my Tranquillity was all
at once interrupted by an Accident which I am
going to relate to you.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s &s;topt here to give Vent to &s;ome
Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forc'd from
her; and continuing in a deep Mu&s;e for five
or &s;ix Minutes, re&s;um'd her Story in this
Manner.</P>
<P>It being my Cu&s;tom to walk in a Fore&s;t
adjoining to one of my Father's Sum mer
Re&s;idences, attended only by my Women,
one Day when I was taking this A mu&s;e|ment,
I perceiv'd at &s;ome Di&s;tance a Man ly|ing
on the Ground; and impell'd by a &s;udden
Curio&s;ity, I advanc'd towards this Per&s;on, whom
upon a nearer View I perceiv'd to have been
wounded very much, and fainted away through
<PB N="262" REF="265">
Lo&s;s of Blood. His Habit being very rich, I
concluded by that he was of no mean Quality:
But when I had look'd upon his Countenance,
pale and langui&s;hing as it was, methought there
appear'd &s;o many Marks of Greatne&s;s, accom|pany'd
with a Sweetne&s;s &s;o happily blended, that
my Attention was engag'd in an extraordinary
Manner, and intere&s;ted me &s;o powerfully in his
Safety, that I commanded &s;ome of my Women
to run immediately for proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
convey him to the Ca&s;tle, while I directed
others to throw &s;ome Water in his Face, and
to apply &s;ome Linen to his Wounds, to &s;top
the Bleeding.</P>
<P>The&s;e charitable Cares re&s;tor'd the wounded
Stranger to his Sen&s;es; he open'd his Eyes, and
turning them &s;lowly to the Objects around him,
fix'd at la&s;t their langui&s;hing Looks on me:
When mov'd, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to &s;ome Re&s;pect
by what he &s;aw in my Countenance, he ro&s;e
with &s;ome Difficulty from the Ground, and
bowing almo&s;t down to it again, by that Action
&s;eem'd to pay me his Acknowledgments for what
he &s;uppos'd I had done for his Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>His extreme Weakne&s;s having oblig'd him to
creep towards a Tree, again&s;t the Back of which
he &s;upported him&s;elf, I went nearer to him, and
having told him the Condition in which I found
him, and the Orders I had di&s;patch'd for A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
reque&s;ted him to acquaint me with his
Name and Quality, and the Adventure which
had brought him into that Condition.</P>
<P>My Name, Madam, an&s;wer'd he, is <HI>Aria|menes,</HI>
my Birth is Noble enough; I have &s;pent
&s;ome Years in my Travels, and was returning
<PB N="264" REF="266">
to my native Country, when pa&s;&s;ing thro' this
Fore&s;t I was &s;eiz'd with an Inclination to &s;leep.
I had ty'd my Hor&s;e to a Tree, and retiring
&s;ome few Paces off, &s;tretch'd my&s;elf at the Foot
of a large Oak who&s;e Branches promis'd me an
agreeable Shade. I had not yet clos'd my Eyes,
when the Slumber I invited was di&s;&s;ipated by
the Sound of &s;ome Voices near me.</P>
<P>A Curio&s;ity, not natural to me, made me
li&s;ten to the Di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e Per&s;ons, whom by
the Tone of their Voices, tho' I could not &s;ee
them, I knew to be Men.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Madam, I was a Witne&s;s to a mo&s;t
horrible Scheme which they concerted together;
my Weakne&s;s will not permit me to enter into
an exact Detail of all I heard: The Re&s;ult of
their Conference was, To &s;eize the Prince&s;s of
this Country and carry her off.</P>
<P>Here, pur&s;ued <HI>Cynecia,</HI> I interrupted the
Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving him
to under&s;tand who I was, he apologiz'd in the
mo&s;t graceful Manner imaginable for the little
Re&s;pect he had hitherto paid me.</P>
<P>I then intreated him to tell me, If he had any
Opportunity of hearing the Name of my de&s;ign'd
Ravi&s;her; to which he reply'd, that he under|&s;tood
it to be <HI>Taxander.</HI></P>
<P>This Man, Madam, was one of my Father's
Favourites, and had been long &s;ecretly in Love
with me.</P>
<P><HI>Ariamenes</HI> then inform'd me, that being en|flam'd
with Rage again&s;t the&s;e impious Villains,
he ro&s;e from the Ground, re-mounted his Hor&s;e,
and defy'd the two Traytors aloud, threatning
them with Death, unle&s;s they abandon'd their
impious De&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">
<HI>Taxander</HI> made no An&s;wer, but ru&s;h'd furi|ou&s;ly
upon him, and had the Bi&s;ene&s;s to &s;uffer
his wicked A&s;&s;ociate to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: But the va|liant
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> tho' he &s;poke mode&s;tly of his
Victory, yet gave me to under&s;tand that he had
made both the Villams abandon their wicked En|terprize,
with their Lives; and that di&s;mount|ing
in order to &s;ee if they were quite dead, he
found him&s;elf &s;o faint with the Wounds he had
received from them both, that he had not
Strength to re-mount his Hor&s;e; but crawling
on, in Hopes of meeting with &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
&s;ainted away at la&s;t through Wearine&s;s and Lo&s;s
of Blood.</P>
<P>While he was giving me this Account, the
Chariot I had &s;ent for arrived, and having made
him &s;uch Acknowledgments as the Obligation
I had received from him demanded, I caus'd
him to get into the Chariot, and &s;ending one
with him to acquaint the Prince my Father
with all that had happen'd, and the Merit o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
the valiant Stranger, I return'd the &s;ame Way
I came with my Women, my Thoughts being
wholly engro&s;s'd by this Unknown.</P>
<P>The Service he had done me fill'd me with a
Gratitude and E&s;teem for him, which prepar'd
my Heart for tho&s;e tender Sentiments I after|wards
entertain'd to the Ruin of my Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I will not tire your Patience, Madam, with
a minute Detail of all the &s;ucceeding Pa&s;&s;ages
of my Story; it &s;hall &s;uffice to tell you, That
<HI>Ariamenes</HI> was received with extraordinary
Marks of E&s;teem by my Father; that his Cure
was &s;oon compleated; and that having vow'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
him&s;elf to my Service, and declar'd an unal|terable
<PB N="266" REF="268">
Pa&s;&s;ion for me, I permitted him to love
me, and gave him that Share in my Heart,
which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever de|prive
him of.</P>
<P>His Attachment to me was &s;oon &s;u&s;pected by
<HI>Taxander</HI>'s Relations, who having &s;ecretly
vow'd his Ruin, endeavour'd to di&s;cover if I
had admitted his Addre&s;&s;es, and having made
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of our Secrets, by means of
the Treachery of one of my Women, procur'd
Information to be given to my Father of our
mutual Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alas! what Mi&s;chiefs did not this fatal Di&s;|covery
produce: My Father, enrag'd to the
la&s;t Degree at this Intelligence, confin'd me to
my Apartments, and order'd <HI>Ariamenes</HI> to leave
his Dominions within three Days.</P>
<P>Spare me, Madam, the Repetition of what
pa&s;s'd at our la&s;t &s;ad Interview, which by large
Bribes to my Guards, he obtain'd.</P>
<P>His Tears, his Agonies, his Vows of ever|la&s;ting
Fidelity, &s;o &s;ooth'd my Melancholy at
parting with him, and per&s;uaded me of his
Con&s;tancy, that I waited for &s;everal Months
with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance
of the Promi&s;e he made me, to do my Father
&s;uch con&s;iderable Services in the War he was
engag'd in with one of his Neighbours, as &s;hould
oblige him to give me to him for his Reward.</P>
<P>But, alas! two Years roll'd on without
bringing back the unfaithful <HI>Ariamenes.</HI> My
Father died, and my Brother who &s;ucceeded
him, being about to force me to marry a Prince
whom I dete&s;ted, I &s;ecretly quitted the Court, and
attended only by this faithful Confidant whom
<PB N="267" REF="269">
you behold with me, and &s;ome few of my tru&s;ty
Dome&s;ticks, I came hither in Search of <HI>Aria|menes,</HI>
he having told me this Country was the
Place of his Birth.</P>
<P><HI>Polenor,</HI> the mo&s;t prudent and faithful of my
Servants, undertook to find out the ungreateful
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> whom yet I was willing to find Ex|cu&s;es
for, but all his Enquiries were to no Ef|fect;
the Name of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> was not known
in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>Tir'd out with un&s;ucce&s;sful Enquiries, I re|&s;olv'd
to &s;eek out &s;ome ob&s;cure Place, where I
might in &s;ecret lament my Misfortunes, and
expect the End of them in Death. My At|tendants
found me out &s;uch a Retreat as I
wanted, in a neighbouring Village, which they
call <HI>Twickenham,</HI> I think, from whence I often
make Excur&s;ions to this Park, attended only as
you &s;ee; and here indulge my&s;elf in Com|plaints
upon the Cruelty of my De&s;tiny.</P>
<P>The &s;orrowful <HI>Cynecia</HI> here ended her Story,

given a great many Interruptions through the
Violence of her Grief: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> after

<P>The afflicted Lady, tho' &s;he re&s;pectfully de|clin'd
this Offer, yet expre&s;s'd a great De&s;ire of

<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who impatiently long'd for
the Hour of meeting the fair Prince&s;s,
with whom &s;he was extremely delighted, con|&s;ulted
her Watch &s;o often, and di&s;cover'd &s;o
much Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and Anxiety, that Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
began to be &s;urpriz'd; and the more, as
&s;he peremptorily commanded him not to attend
her in her Evening Walk. This Prohibition,
which, tho' he dur&s;t not di&s;pute, he &s;ecretly re|&s;olv'd
to di&s;obey; and as &s;oon as &s;he &s;et out for
the Park with her u&s;ual Attendants, he &s;lipp'd
out by a Back-door, and keeping her in his
Sight, him&s;elf un&s;een, &s;he ventur'd to watch
her Motions.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="271">
As he had expected to unravel &s;ome great

&s;he continu'd her Walk in the Park with great
Compo&s;ure; and tho' &s;he was &s;oon join'd by the
imaginary Prince&s;s, yet conceiving her to be &s;ome
young Lady, with whom &s;he had commenc'd an

&s;he would be inclin'd to return, and then &s;hew

for which he did not imagine &s;he need be of|fended.</P>
<P>The two Ladies being met, after reciprocal
Compliments, the Prince&s;s intreated <HI>Arabella</HI>
to relate her Adventures; who not being wil|ling
to violate the Laws of Romance, which
require an unbounded Confidence upon the&s;e
Occa&s;ions, began very &s;uccinctly to recount the
Hi&s;tory of her Life; which, as &s;he manag'd
it, contain'd Events almo&s;t as Romantick and
Incredible as any in her Romances; winding
them up with a Confe&s;&s;ion that &s;he did not hate
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom &s;he acknowledg'd to be
one of the mo&s;t faithful and zealous of Lovers.</P>
<P><HI>Cynecia</HI> with a Sigh, congratulated her upon

<P>Finding her in a Swoon, &s;he di&s;patch'd. <HI>Lucy,</HI>
who was near her, to look for &s;ome Water to
throw in her Face; but that Lady breathing a
deep Sigh, open'd her langui&s;hing Eyes, and fix|ing
a melancholy Look upon <HI>Arabella,</HI></P>
<P>Ah! Madam, &s;aid &s;he, wonder not at my
Affliction and Surprize, &s;ince in the Per&s;on of
your Lover I behold the ungrateful <HI>Ariamenes.</HI></P>
<P>Oh Heav'ns! my fair Prince&s;s, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
What is it you &s;ay? Is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>Glan|ville</HI>

<P>He, cried the afflicted Prince&s;s with a di&s;|order'd

<HI>Cynecia,</HI> who if po&s;&s;ible, will cea&s;e to love the
unfaithful <HI>Ariamenes,</HI> and will never hate the
beautiful <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Saying this, without giving her Time to an|&s;wer,
&s;he took hold of her Confidant by the
Arm, and went away with &s;o much Swiftne&s;s,
that &s;he was out of &s;ight before <HI>Arabella</HI> was

Our charming Heroine, ignorant till now of

&s;he, with a Sigh that &s;hook her whole

<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> who had walk'd as fa&s;t as

<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had never heard her in

Thought gave him a Concern that &s;pread it&s;elf

on her with a fix'd Attention, dreading, yet
wi&s;hing &s;he would &s;peak again; equally divided
between his Hopes, that her next Speech would
remove his Su&s;picion, and his Fears, that it
might more confirm them.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> taking Notice of his pen&s;ive Po&s;ture,
turn'd away her Head, le&s;t by beholding him,
&s;he &s;hould relent, and treat him with le&s;s Seve|rity

<P>Indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Glanville</HI> who un|der&s;tood

<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> no longer able to contain her&s;elf,
bur&s;t into Tears at this Que&s;tion: With one
Hand &s;he made repeated Signs to him to be

<P>But Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively &s;hock'd at this

his Knees before her, and taking her Hand,
which he tenderly pre&s;t to his Lips,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing indeed no great Matters, but
being a Prelude to greater.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;tood fix'd like a Statue
in the Place where <HI>Arabella</HI> had left him,
was rous'd by this Me&s;&s;age, which tho' palliated
<PB N="278" REF="280">
a little by the Girl that deliver'd it, who was
not quite &s;o punctual as <HI>Lucy,</HI> neverthele&s;s fill'd
him with extreme Confu&s;ion. He obey'd how|ever
immediately, and retiring to his own Apart|ment,
endeavour'd to recall to his Memory all
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had &s;aid.</P>
<P>The Ambiguity of her Style, which had led
him into a Su&s;picion he had never entertain'd
before, her la&s;t Words had partly explain'd, if
as he under&s;tood &s;he did, &s;he meant him by
<HI>Ariamenes.</HI> Taking this for granted, he ea&s;ily
conceiv'd &s;ome Plot grounded on her Roman|tick
Notions had been laid, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Behaviour to her ru&s;h'd that Mo|ment
into his Thoughts: He in&s;tantly recollected
all his Fooleries, his Hi&s;tory, his Letter, his
Conver&s;ation, all apparently copied from tho&s;e
Books &s;he was &s;o fond of, and probably done
with a View to &s;ome other De&s;ign upon her.</P>
<P>The&s;e Reflections, join'd to his new awak'd
Su&s;picions, that he was in Love with her, con|vinc'd
him he was the Author of their pre&s;ent
Mi&s;-under&s;tanding; and that he had impos'd
&s;ome new Fallacy upon <HI>Arabella,</HI> in order to
promote a Quarrel between them.</P>
<P>Fir'd almo&s;t to Madne&s;s at this Thought, he
&s;tamp'd about his Room, vowing Revenge up|on
Sir <HI>George,</HI> execrating Romances, and cur&s;|ing
his own Stupidity for not di&s;covering Sir
<HI>George</HI> was his Rival, and knowing his plotting
Talent, not providing again&s;t his Artifices.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Re&s;olutions were to &s;et out imme|diately
for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Seat, and force him to
confe&s;s the Part he had acted again&s;t him: But a
<PB N="279" REF="281">
Moment's Con&s;ideration convinc'd him, that
was not the mo&s;t probable Place to find him in,
&s;ince it was much more likely he was waiting
the Succe&s;s of his Schemes in <HI>London,</HI> or perhaps
at <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>Next to &s;atiating his Vengeance, the Plea&s;ure
of detecting him in &s;uch a Manner, that he
could not po&s;&s;ibly deny or palliate his Guilt, was
next his Heart.</P>
<P>He re&s;olv'd therefore to give it out, that he
was gone to <HI>London,</HI> to make Lady <HI>Bella</HI> be|lieve
it was in Obedience to her Commands
that he had left her, with a Purpo&s;e not to re|turn
till he had clear'd his Innocence; but in
reality to conceal him&s;elf in his own Apartment,
and &s;ee what Effects his reputed Ab&s;ence would
produce.</P>
<P>Having thus taken his Re&s;olution, he &s;ent
for Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> his Father's Steward, to who&s;e
Care he had entru&s;ted Lady <HI>Bella</HI> in her Retire|ment,
and acquainting him with Part of his
Apprehen&s;ions with Regard to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s At|temp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s
upon his Cou&s;in; he imparted to him
his De&s;ign of &s;taying conceal'd there, in order
to di&s;cover more effectually tho&s;e Attempts, and
to pre&s;erve Lady <HI>Bella</HI> from any Con&s;equence
of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> approv'd of his De&s;ign; and a&s;|&s;ur'd
him of his Vigilance and Care, both in
concealing his Stay, and al&s;o in giving him No|tice
of every Thing that pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> then wrote a &s;hort Billet to
<HI>Arabella,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing his Grief for her Di&s;plea|&s;ure,
his Departure in Obedience to her Orders,
and his Re&s;olution not to appear in her Pre&s;ence,
<PB N="280" REF="282">
till he could give her convincing Proofs of his
Innocence.</P>
<P>This Letter he &s;ent by <HI>Roberts,</HI> which <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
conde&s;cended to read, but would return no
An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> then mounting his Hor&s;e,
which <HI>Roberts</HI> had order'd to be got ready, rode
away, and leaving him at a Hou&s;e he &s;ometimes
put up at, return'd on Foot, and was let in by
Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> at the Garden-door, and conducted
un&s;een to his Chamber.</P>
<P>While he pa&s;s'd that Night and great Part of
the next Day, meditating on the Treachery of
Sir <HI>George,</HI> and &s;oothing his Unea&s;ine&s;s with the
Hopes of Revenge, <HI>Arabella,</HI> no le&s;s di&s;quieted,
mus'd on the Infidelity of her Lover, the De|&s;pair
of <HI>Cynecia,</HI> and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of her
ever being happy. Then ran&s;acking her Me|mory
for In&s;tances in her Romances of Ladies
equally unfortunate with her&s;elf, &s;he would
&s;ometimes compare her&s;elf to one Lady, &s;ome|times
to another, adapting their Sentiments,
and making U&s;e of their Language in her Com|plaints.</P>
<P>Great Part of the Day being &s;pent in this
Manner, the unea&s;y Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s of her Mind
made her wi&s;h to &s;ee <HI>Cynecia</HI> again. She long'd
to ask her a hundred Que&s;tions about the un|faithful
<HI>Ariamenes,</HI> which the Suddaine&s;s of her
Departure, and her own A&s;toni&s;hment prevented
her from doing, when &s;he made that fatal Di&s;|covery,
which had co&s;t her &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sometimes a faint Hope would ari&s;e in her
Mind that <HI>Cynecia</HI> might be mi&s;taken, thro' the
great Re&s;emblance that po&s;&s;ibly was between
<HI>Ariamenes</HI> and <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283">
She remember'd that <HI>Mandana</HI> had been de|ceiv'd
by the Likene&s;s of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to <HI>Spitridates;</HI>
and concluded that illu&s;trious Prince incon&s;tant,
becau&s;e <HI>Spitridates,</HI> whom &s;he took for <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
&s;aw her carry'd away, without offering to
re&s;cue her.</P>
<P>Dwelling with Eagerne&s;s upon this Thought,
becau&s;e it afforded her a temporary Relief from
others more tormenting, &s;he re&s;olv'd to go to
the Park, tho' &s;he had but little Hopes of find|ing
<HI>Cynecia</HI> there; &s;uppo&s;ing it but too proba|ble,
that the Di&s;turbance which the Sight, or
fancy'd Sight of <HI>Ariamenes</HI> had given her, would
confine her for &s;ome Days to her Chamber.
Yet however &s;mall the Probability was of meet|ing
with her, &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t the impatient
De&s;ire &s;he felt of going to &s;eek her.</P>
<P>Di&s;pen&s;ing therefore with the Attendance of
any other Servant but <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;he left her Apart|ment,
with a De&s;ign of re&s;uming her u&s;ual

refus'd them at fir&s;t, but upon their repeated
Importunity, recollecting that the Prince&s;s of
<HI>Gaul</HI> had inform'd her &s;he re&s;ided there, &s;he
con&s;ented to go, in Hopes &s;ome favourable

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who did not doubt but

&s;at waiting with anxious Impatience for
his Return. The Evening drew on apace, he
number'd the Hours, and began to grow unea&s;y
at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s long Stay. His Chamber Win|dow
looking into the Garden, he thought he
&s;aw his Cou&s;in, cover'd with her Veil as u&s;ual,
ha&s;ten down one of the Walks; his Heart
leap'd at this tran&s;ient View, he threw up the
Sa&s;h, and looking out, &s;aw her very plainly
&s;trike into a cro&s;s Walk, and a Moment after
&s;aw Sir <HI>George,</HI> who came out of a little Sum|mer-hou&s;e,
at her Feet. Tran&s;ported with
Rage at this Sight, he &s;natch'd up his Sword,
flew down the Stairs into the Garden, and
came running like a Madman up the Walk in
which the Lovers were. The Lady ob&s;erving
him fir&s;t, for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Back was towards
<PB N="283" REF="285">
him, &s;hriek'd aloud, and not knowing what
&s;he did, ran towards the Hou&s;e, crying for
Help, and came back as fa&s;t, yet not Time
enough to prevent Mi&s;chief: For Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
actuated by an irre&s;i&s;tible Fury, cry'd out
to Sir <HI>George</HI> to defend him&s;elf, who had but
ju&s;t Time to draw his Sword and make an in|effectual
Pa&s;s at Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> when he receiv'd
his into his Body, and fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> lo&s;ing his Re&s;entment in&s;en&s;i|bly
at the Sight of his Rival's Blood, threw
down his Sword, and endeavour'd to &s;upport
him; while the Lady, who had lo&s;t her Veil
in her running, and to the great A&s;toni&s;hment
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> prov'd to be his Si&s;ter, came
up to them, with Tears and Exclamations,
blaming her&s;elf for all that had happen'd.
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with a Heart throbbing with Re|mor&s;e
for what he had done, gaz'd on his Si&s;ter
with an accu&s;ing Look, as &s;he hung over the
wounded Baronet with &s;treaming Eyes, &s;ome|times
wringing her Hands, then cla&s;ping them
together in an Agony of Grief.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> having Strength enough left to
ob&s;erve her Di&s;order, and the generous Concern
of <HI>Glanville,</HI> who holding him in his Arms,
intreated his Si&s;ter to &s;end for proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
Dear <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid he, you are too kind, I

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> renewing her Tears and Ex|clamations
at this Sight, he was oblig'd to lay
Sir <HI>George</HI> gently upon the Ground, and ran to
find out &s;omebody to &s;end for a Surgeon, and
to help him to convey him into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In his Way he was met by Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> who
was coming to &s;eek him; and with a Look of
Terror and Confu&s;ion told him, Lady <HI>Bella</HI>

his Father with what had happen'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> upon the Surgeon's Report that

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">, he refus'd to &s;ee or &s;peak to any Body, till
<PB N="285" REF="287">
he was told Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and the Phy&s;icians were
arriv'd.</P>
<P>He then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of
his beloved Cou&s;in, which he &s;oon di&s;cover'd
by their &s;ignificant Ge&s;tures and half pronounc'd
Words, to be very bad. They comforted him
however, with Hopes that &s;he might recover,
and in&s;i&s;ting upon her being kept very quiet,
oblig'd him to quit the Room. While all the
nece&s;&s;ary Methods were taken to abate the Vio|lence
of the Di&s;ea&s;e, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who had been
inform'd by his Steward of his Son's Duel with
Sir <HI>George,</HI> was amaz'd to the la&s;t Degree at
two &s;uch terrible Accidents.</P>
<P>Having &s;een his Son to his Chamber, and re|commended
him to be patient and compos'd,
he went to vi&s;it the young Baronet, and was
not a little &s;urpriz'd to find his Daughter &s;itting
at his Bed's Head, with all the Appearance of
a violent Affliction.</P>
<P>Indeed Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Cares were &s;o wholly
engro&s;s'd by Sir <HI>George</HI>'s, that &s;he hardly
ever thought of her Cou&s;in <HI>Arabella,</HI> and had
ju&s;t &s;tept into her Chamber while the Surgeons
were dre&s;&s;ing Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Wound, and renew'd
her Attendance upon him as &s;oon as that was
over.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> however, thought proper to
make &s;ome trifling Excu&s;es to her Father for
her Solicitude about Sir <HI>George.</HI> And the
young Baronet, on whom the Fear of Death
produc'd its u&s;ual Effects, and made him ex|tremely
concern'd for the Errors of his pa&s;t
Life, and very de&s;irous of attoning for them if
po&s;&s;ible, a&s;&s;ur'd Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that if he liv'd he
<PB N="286" REF="288">
would offer him&s;elf to his Acceptance for a Son-in-law;
declaring that he had ba&s;ely trifled
with the E&s;teem of his Daughter, but that &s;he
had wholly &s;ubdued him to her&s;elf by her for|giving
Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was very de&s;irous of knowing the
Occa&s;ion of his Quarrel with his Son, but Sir
<HI>George</HI> was too weak to hold any further Con|ver&s;ation,
upon which Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> after a &s;hort
Vi&s;it retir'd, taking Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> along with
him.</P>
<P>That the Reader, who&s;e Imagination is no
doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning
of the&s;e Two extraordinary Incidents, may be
left no longer in Su&s;pence, we think proper to
explain them both in the following Chapter,

<P>OUR fair and afflicted Heroine, accompa|nied
by the Ladies we have mention'd,
having cro&s;s'd the River, pur&s;u'd their Walk
upon its winding Banks, entertaining them|&s;elves
with the u&s;ual Topicks of Conver&s;ation

and Lo&s;ings at <HI>Brag,</HI> the Prices of Silks, the

<HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with this (as &s;he
thought) in&s;ipid Di&s;cour&s;e, which gave no Re|lief
to the Anxiety of her Mind, but added a
Kind of Fretfulne&s;s and Impatience to her
Grief; that &s;he re&s;olv'd to quit them, and with
<HI>Lucy,</HI> go in que&s;t of the Prince&s;s of <HI>Gaul</HI>'s
Retreat.</P>
<P>The Ladies however, in&s;i&s;ted upon her not
leaving them; and her Excu&s;e that &s;he was
going in &s;earch of an unfortunate Unknown,
for whom &s;he had vow'd a Friend&s;hip, made
them all immediately re&s;olve to accompany her,
extremely diverted with the Oddity of the De|&s;ign,
and &s;acrificing her to their Mirth by &s;ly
Leers, Whi&s;pers, &s;tifled Laughs, and a thou|&s;and
little &s;prightly Sallies, which the di&s;con&s;o|late
<HI>Arabella</HI> took no Notice of, &s;o deeply were
her Thoughts engag'd.</P>
<P>Tho' &s;he knew not which Way to direct her
Steps, yet concluding the melancholy <HI>Cynccia</HI>
would certainly chu&s;e &s;ome very &s;olitary Place
for her Re&s;idence, &s;he rambled about among
the lea&s;t frequented Paths, follow'd by the young
Ladies, who ardently de&s;ir'd to &s;ee this unfor|tunate
Unknown; tho' at <HI>Arabella</HI>'s earne&s;t
Reque&s;t, they promis'd not to &s;hew them&s;elves
to the Lady, who, &s;he inform'd them, for
very urgent Rea&s;ons, was oblig'd to keep her&s;elf
conceal'd.</P>
<P>Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate
Spirits of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Companions, they were en|abled
to &s;upport it by the Diver&s;ion her Beha|viour
afforded them.</P>
<P>Every Pea&s;ant &s;he met, &s;he enquir'd if a Beau|tiful
Lady di&s;guis'd did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">
thereabout.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">
To &s;ome &s;he gave a De&s;cription of her Per|&s;on,
to others an Account of the Dome&s;ticks
that were with her; not forgetting her Dre&s;s,
her Melancholy, and the great Care &s;he took
to keep her&s;elf conceal'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trange Enquiries, with the &s;trange
Language in which they were made, not a lit|tle
&s;urpriz'd the good People to whom &s;he ad|dre&s;s'd
her&s;elf, yet mov'd to Re&s;pect by the ma|je&s;tick
Loveline&s;s of her Per&s;on, they an&s;wer'd
her in the Negative, without any Mixture of
Scoff and Impertinence.</P>
<P>How unfavourable is Chance, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI>
fretting at the Di&s;appointment, to Per&s;ons who
have any Reliance upon it! This Lady that I
have been in Search of &s;o long without Succe&s;s,
may probably be found by others who do not
&s;eek her, who&s;e Pre&s;ence &s;he may wi&s;h to
avoid, yet not be able.</P>
<P>The young Ladies finding it grew late, ex|pre&s;s'd
their Apprehen&s;ions at being without any
Attendants; and de&s;ir'd <HI>Arabella</HI> to give over
her Search for that Day. <HI>Arabella</HI> at this Hint
of Danger, enquir'd very earne&s;tly, If they ap|prehended
any Attempts to carry them away?
And without &s;taying for an An&s;wer, urg'd them
to walk Home as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, apologizing
for the Danger into which &s;he had &s;o indi&s;creet|ly
drawn both them and her&s;elf; yet added her
Hopes, that if any Attempt &s;hould be made
upon their Liberty, &s;ome generous Cavalier
would pa&s;s by who would re&s;cue them: A Thing
&s;o common, that they had no Rea&s;on to de|&s;pair
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="291">
<HI>Arabella</HI> con&s;truing the Silence with which
her Companions heard the&s;e A&s;&s;urances, into a
Doubt of their being &s;o favoured by Fortune,
proceeded to inform them of &s;everal In&s;tances
wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and
Deliverance from Ravi&s;hers.</P>
<P>She mention'd particularly the Re&s;cue of
<HI>Statira</HI> by her own Brother, whom &s;he ima|gin'd
for many Years dead; that of the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Berenice</HI> by an ab&s;olute Stranger, and many
others, who&s;e Names, Characters and Adven|tures
&s;he occa&s;ionally run over; all which the
young Ladies heard with inconceivable A&s;to|ni&s;hment.
And the Detail had &s;uch an Effect
upon <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Imagination, bewilder'd as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
was in the Folies of Romances, that '&s;pying
three or four Hor&s;emen riding along the Road
towards them, &s;he immediately concluded they
would be all &s;eiz'd and carry'd off.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with this Belief, &s;he utter'd a loud
Cry, and flew to the Water-&s;ide, which alarm|ing
the Ladies, who could not imagine what
was the Matter, they ran after her as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> &s;top'd when &s;he came to the Water|&s;ide,
and looking round about, and not perceiv|ing
any Boat to waft them over to <HI>Richmond,</HI> a
Thought &s;uddenly darted into her Mind, wor|thy
tho&s;e ingenious Books which gave it Birth.</P>
<P>Turning therefore to the Ladies, who all at
once were enquiring the Cau&s;e of her Fright;</P>
<P>'Tis now, my fair Companions, &s;aid &s;he,
with a &s;olemn Accent, that the De&s;tinies have
<PB N="290" REF="292">
furni&s;h'd you with an Opportunity of di&s;play|ing
in a Manner truly Heroick, the Sublimity
of your Virtue, and the Grandeur of your

<P>The Action we have it in our Power to per|form
will immortalize our Fame, and rai&s;e us
to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the re|nown'd
<HI>Clelia</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Like her, we may expect Statues erected to
our Honour: Like her, be propos'd as Patterns
to Heroines in en&s;uing Ages: And like her,
perhaps, meet with Sceptres and Crowns for
our Reward.</P>
<P>What that beauteous <HI>Roman</HI> Lady perform'd
to pre&s;erve her&s;elf from Violation by the impi|ous
<HI>Sextus,</HI> let us imitate to avoid the Violence
our intended Ravi&s;hers yonder come to offer us.</P>
<P>Fortune, which has thrown us into this Exi|gence,
pre&s;ents us the Means of gloriou&s;ly
e&s;caping: And the Admiration and E&s;teem of
all Ages to come, will be the Recompence of
our noble Daring.</P>
<P>Once more, my fair Companions, If your
Honour be dear to you, if an immortal Glory
be worth your &s;eeking, follow the Exam|ple
I &s;hall &s;et you, and equal with me the <HI>Ro|man

<P>Saying this, &s;he plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI> in|tending
to &s;wim over it, as <HI>Clelia</HI> did the <HI>Tyber.</HI></P>
<P>The young Ladies, who had li&s;ten'd with
&s;ilent A&s;toni&s;hment at the long Speech &s;he had
made them, the Purport of which not one of
them under&s;tood, &s;cream'd out aloud at this
<PB N="291" REF="293">
horrid Spectacle, and wringing their Hands,
ran backwards and forwards like di&s;tracted Per|&s;ons,
crying for Help. <HI>Lucy</HI> tore her Hair,
and was in the utmo&s;t Agony of Grief, when
Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> who, as we have &s;aid before, kept
them always in Sight, having ob&s;erv'd <HI>Arabella</HI>
running towards the Water-&s;ide, follow'd them
as fa&s;t as he could, and came Time enough up
to &s;ee her frantick Action. Jumping into the
River immediately after her, he caught hold of
her Gown, and drew her after him to the Shore.
A Boat that In&s;tant appearing, he put her into
it, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and to all Appearance dead. He
and <HI>Lucy</HI> &s;upporting her, they were wa&s;ted over
in a few Moments to the other Side: Her Hou&s;e
being near the River, Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> carry'd her
in his Arms to it; and as &s;oon as he &s;aw her
&s;hew Signs of returning Life, left her to the
Care of the Women, who made ha&s;te to put
her into a warm Bed, and ran to find out
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as we have related.</P>
<P>There remains now only to account for
Sir <HI>George</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s &s;udden Appear|ance,
which happen'd, gentle Reader, exactly
as follows.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> having &s;et out pretty late in
the Afternoon, with a De&s;ign of &s;taying all
Night at <HI>Richmond,</HI> as her Chai&s;e drove up
<HI>Kew-Lane,</HI> &s;aw one of her Cou&s;in's Women,
<HI>Deborah</HI> by Name, talking to a Gentleman,
whom, notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;gui&s;e of a Hor&s;e|man's
Coat, and a Hat &s;louch'd over his Face,
&s;he knew to be Sir <HI>George Bellmour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="294">
This Sight alarming her Jealou&s;y, and re|newing
all her former Su&s;picions, that her Cou|&s;in's
Charms rival'd hers in his Heart, as &s;oon
as &s;he alighted, finding <HI>Arabella</HI> was not at
Home, &s;he retir'd in great Angui&s;h of Mind to
her Chamber, revolving in her Mind every
Particular of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Behaviour to her Cou|&s;in
in the Country, and finding new Cau&s;e for
Su&s;picion in every Thing &s;he recollected, and
reflecting upon the Di&s;gui&s;e in which &s;he &s;aw
him, and his Conference with her Woman, &s;he
concluded her&s;elf had all along been the Dupe
of his Artifice, and her Cou&s;in the real Object
of his Love.</P>
<P>This Thought throwing her into an Extre|mity
of Rage, all her tendere&s;t Emotions were
lo&s;t in the De&s;ire of Revenge. She imagin'd
to her&s;elf &s;o much Plea&s;ure from expo&s;ing his
Treachery, and putting it our of his Power to
deny it, that &s;he re&s;olv'd, whatever it co&s;t her,
to have that Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing therefore <HI>Deborah</HI> was now re|turn'd,
&s;he rung her Bell, and commanded her
Attendance on her in her Chamber.</P>
<P>The Stern Brow with which &s;he receiv'd
her, frighten'd the Girl, con&s;cious of her Guilt,
into a Di&s;po&s;ition to confe&s;s all, even before &s;he
was tax'd with any thing.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;aw her Terror, and endea|vour'd
to heighten it, by entering at once into
Complaints and Exclamations again&s;t her,
threatning to acquaint her Father with her Plots
to betray her Lady, and a&s;&s;uring her of a very
&s;evere Puni&s;hment for her Treachery.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="295">
The Girl, terrify'd extremely at the&s;e Me|naces,
begg'd Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> with Tears, to

her Lady, with her Fault; adding, that &s;he
would confe&s;s all, and never while &s;he liv'd, do
&s;uch a Thing again.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> would make her no Promi&s;es,
but urg'd her to confe&s;s: Upon which <HI>Deborah</HI>
&s;obbing, own'd, That for the Sake of the Pre|&s;ents
Sir <HI>George</HI> had made her, &s;he con&s;ented to
meet him privately from Time to Time, and
give him an Account of every Thing that
pa&s;s'd with Regard to her Lady; not thinking
there was any Harm in it. That according to
his De&s;ires, &s;he had con&s;tantly acquainted him
with all her Lady's Motions, when, and where
&s;he went, how &s;he and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> agreed,
and a hundred other Things which he enquir'd
about. That that Day in particular, he had
intreated her to procure him the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ans of an
Interview with her Lady, if po&s;&s;ible; and un|der&s;tanding
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was not at <HI>Richmond,</HI>
&s;he had let him privately into the Garden,
where &s;he hop'd to prevail upon her Lady
to go.</P>
<P>What, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;urpriz'd, Is Sir
<HI>George</HI> waiting for my Cou&s;in in the Garden
then?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Deborah:</HI> But
I'll go and tell him to wait no longer; and
never &s;peak to him again, if your Lady&s;hip
will but be pleas'd to forgive me.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> having taken her Re&s;olution,
not only promis'd <HI>Deborah</HI> her Pardon, but al&s;o

a Reward, provided &s;he would contrive it &s;o,
that &s;he might meet Sir <HI>George</HI> in&s;tead of her

Spirit of Intrigue in her, immediately propos'd
her putting on one of her Lady's Veils; which
as it was now the Clo&s;e of the Evening, would
di&s;gui&s;e her &s;ufficiently; to which Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
tran&s;ported with the Thoughts of thus having
an Opportunity of convincing Sir <HI>George</HI> of his
Perfidy, and reproaching him for it, con&s;ented,
and bid her bring it without being ob&s;erv'd, into
her Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>Deborah</HI> informing her, that Sir <HI>George</HI> was
conceal'd in the Summer-Hou&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;hort Chapter indeed, but full of Matter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>RICHMOND</HI> was now a Scene of the ut|mo&s;t
Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Fever was ri&s;en to &s;uch a Height, that &s;he was
<PB N="295" REF="297">
given over by the Phy&s;icians; and Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Wounds, tho' not judg'd mortal at fir&s;t, yet by
the great Effu&s;ion of Blood had left him in &s;o
weak a Condition, that he was thought to be
in great Danger.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> almo&s;t di&s;tracted with the Fears
of the Con&s;equences of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Death, in|treated
his Son to quit the Kingdom; but
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> prote&s;ting he would rather die
than leave <HI>Arabella</HI> in that Illne&s;s, he was
oblig'd to give Bail for his Appearance, in Ca&s;e
Sir <HI>George</HI> dy'd: This Affair, notwith&s;tanding
all Endeavours to prevent it, having made a
great Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> oppre&s;t as he was with the
Weight of all the&s;e Calamities, was yet oblig'd
to labour ince&s;&s;antly to keep up the Spirits of
his Son and Daughter. The &s;ettled De&s;pair of
the one, and the &s;ilent &s;welling Grief of the
other, cut him to the Heart. He omitted no
Arguments his Paternal Affection &s;ugge&s;ted to
him, to moderate their Affliction. Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
often endeavour'd to a&s;&s;ume a Compo&s;ure
he was very far from feeling, in order to &s;atisfy
his Father. But Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> looking upon
her&s;elf to be the Cau&s;e of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Misfor|tune,
declar'd, She &s;hould be mi&s;erable all her
Life, if he died.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> in her lucid Intervals, being &s;en&s;ible
of her Danger, prepar'd for Death, with great
Piety and Con&s;tancy of Mind, having &s;olemnly
a&s;&s;ur'd Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> of her Forgivene&s;s, who
would not at that Time enter into an Explana|tion
<PB N="296" REF="298">
of the Affair which had given her Offence
for fear of perplexing her. She permitted his
Pre&s;ence often in her Chamber, and de&s;ir'd with
great Earne&s;tne&s;s the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome worthy
Divine in her Preparations for Death. The
Pious and Learned Doctor&mdash;at Sir <HI>Charles</HI>'s
Intimation of his Niece's De&s;ire, came con|&s;tantly
twice a Day to attend her. Her Fever,
by a favourable Cri&s;is, and the great Skill of her
Phy&s;icians, left her in a Fortnight; but this
violent Di&s;temper had made &s;uch a Ravage in
her delicate Con&s;titution, and reduc'd her &s;o low
that there &s;eem'd very little Probability of her
Recovery. Doctor&mdash;, in whom her un|feign'd
Piety, her uncommon Firmne&s;s of Mind,
had created a great E&s;teem and Tenderne&s;s for
her, took all Opportunities of comforting, ex|horting,
and praying by her. The Occa&s;ion of
her Illne&s;s being the Subject of every body's
Conver&s;ation at <HI>Richmond,</HI> he gently hinted it
to her, and urg'd her to explain her Rea&s;ons for
&s;o extravagant an Action.</P>
<P>In the Divine Frame <HI>Arabella</HI> was then in,
this Action appear'd to her ra&s;h and vain-glori|ous,
and &s;he acknowledg'd it to be &s;o to her
pious Monitor: Yet &s;he related the Motives
which induc'd her to it, the Danger &s;he was in
of being carry'd away, the Parity of her Cir|cum&s;tances
then with <HI>Clelia,</HI> and her emulous
De&s;ire of doing as much to pre&s;erve her Ho|nour
as that renown'd <HI>Roman</HI> Lady did for
hers.</P>
<P>The good Doctor was extremely &s;urpriz'd at
this Di&s;cour&s;e: He was beginning to think her
<PB N="297" REF="299">
again delirious; but <HI>Arabella</HI> added to this Ac|count
&s;uch &s;en&s;ible Rea&s;oning on the Nature
of that Fondne&s;s for Fame, which prompted
her to &s;o ra&s;h an Undertaking, that the Doctor
left her in &s;trange Embarra&s;&s;ment, not knowing
how to account for a Mind at once &s;o enlight|en'd,
and &s;o ridiculous.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> meeting him as he came out
of her Chamber, the Doctor took this Oppor|tunity
to acknowledge the Difficulties <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
incon&s;i&s;tent Di&s;cour&s;e had thrown him into.
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> taking him into his own Apart|ment,
explain'd the Nature of that &s;eeming
Incon&s;i&s;tency, and expatiated at large upon the
Di&s;orders Romances had occa&s;ion'd in her Ima|gination;
&s;everal In&s;tances of which he re|counted,
and fill'd the Doctor with the greate&s;t
A&s;toni&s;hment and Concern. He lamented pa|thetically
the Ruin &s;uch a ridiculous Study had
brought on &s;o noble a Mind; and a&s;&s;ur'd Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> he would &s;pare no Endeavours to re&s;cue
it from &s;o &s;hocking a Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> thank'd him for his good De|&s;ign,
with a Tran&s;port which his Fears of his
Cou&s;in's Danger almo&s;t mingled with Tears;
and the Doctor and he agreed to expect for &s;ome
few Days longer an Alteration for the better in
the Health of her Body, before he attempted
the Cure of her Mind. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s extreme
Anxiety had made him in Appearance neglect

No &s;ooner had the Phy&s;icians declared that
<HI>Arabella</HI> was no longer in Danger, than his
Mind being freed from that tormenting Load
of Su&s;pence under which it had labour'd while
her Recovery was yet doubful, he went to
Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Chamber, who by rea&s;on of his
Weakne&s;s, tho' he was al&s;o upon the Recovery,
&s;till kept his Bed.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> tho' he ardently wi&s;h'd to &s;ee him,

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being in the Author's Opinion, the be&s;t
Chapter in this Hi&s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE good Divine, who had the Cure of
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Mind greatly at Heart, no
&s;ooner perceiv'd that the Health of her Body was
almo&s;t re&s;tor'd, and that he might talk to her
without the Fear of any Inconvenience, than
he introduc'd the Subject of her throwing her|&s;elf
into the River, which he had before lightly
touch'd upon, and &s;till declar'd him&s;elf di&s;&s;ati&s;|fy'd
with.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> now more di&s;pos'd to defend this
Point than when langui&s;hing under the Pre&s;&s;ure
of Pain and Dejection of Mind, endeavour'd
by Arguments founded upon Romantick Hero|i&s;m,
to prove, That it was not only rea&s;onable
and ju&s;t, but al&s;o great and glorious, and exactly
conformable to the Rules of Heroick Virtue.</P>
<P>The Doctor li&s;ten'd to her with a mix'd
Emotion, between Pity, Reverence, and Amaze|ment:
And tho' in the Performance of his Of|fice
he had been accu&s;tom'd to accommodate
his Notions to every Under&s;tanding, and had
therefore accumulated a great Variety of To|picks
and Illu&s;trations; yet he found him&s;elf
now engag'd in a Controver&s;y for which he was
not &s;o well prepar'd as he imagin'd, and was at
<PB N="300" REF="302">
a Lo&s;s for &s;ome leading Principle, by which he
might introduce his Rea&s;onings, and begin his
Confutation.</P>
<P>Tho' he &s;aw much to prai&s;e in her Di&s;cour&s;e,
he was afraid of confirming her Ob&s;tinacy by
Commendation: And tho' he al&s;o found much
to blame, he dreaded to give Pain to a Delicacy
he rever'd.</P>
<P>Perceiving however, that <HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;ilent,
as if expecting his Reply, he re&s;olv'd not to
bring upon him&s;elf the Guilt of abandoning her
to her Mi&s;take, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking
forc'd him to find &s;omething to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Tho' it is not ea&s;y, Madam, &s;aid he, for any
one that has the Honour of conver&s;ing with
your Lady&s;hip to pre&s;erve his Attention free to
any other Idea, than &s;uch as your Di&s;cour&s;e
tends immediately to impre&s;s, yet I have not
been able while you was &s;peaking, to refrain
from &s;ome very mortifying Reflections on the
Imperfection of all human Happine&s;s, and the
uncertain Con&s;equences of all tho&s;e Advantages
which we think our&s;elves not only at Liberty
to de&s;ire, but oblig'd to cultivate.</P>
<P>Tho' I have known &s;ome Dangers and Di|&s;tre&s;&s;es,
reply'd <HI>Arabella</HI> gravely, yet I did not
imagine my&s;elf &s;uch a Mirror of Calamity as
could not be &s;een without Concern. If my Life
has not been eminently fortunate, it has yet
e&s;cap'd the great Evils of Per&s;ecution, Captivity,
Shipwrecks and Dangers to which many Ladies
far more Illu&s;trious both by Birth and Merit
than my&s;elf, have been expos'd. And indeed,
<PB N="301" REF="303">
tho' I have &s;ometimes rais'd Envy, or po&s;&s;ibly
incurr'd Hatred, yet I have no Rea&s;on to believe
I was ever beheld with Pity before.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;aw he had not introduc'd his
Di&s;cour&s;e in the mo&s;t acceptable Manner; but
it was too late to repent.</P>
<P>Let me not, Madam, &s;aid he, be cen&s;ur'd
before I have fully explain'd my Sentiments.</P>
<P>That you have been envy'd, I can readily
believe: For who that gives Way to natural
Pa&s;&s;ions has not Rea&s;on to envy the Lady <HI>Ara|bella?</HI>
But that you have been hated, I am in|deed
le&s;s willing to think, tho' I know how ea|&s;ily
the greater Part of Mankind hate tho&s;e by
whom they are excell'd.</P>
<P>If the Mi&s;ery of my Condition, reply'd
<HI>Arabella,</HI> has been able to excite that Melan|choly
your fir&s;t. Words &s;eem'd to imply, Flat|tery
will contribute very little towards the Im|provement
of it. Nor do I expect from the
Severity of the Sacerdotal Character, any of
tho&s;e Prai&s;es, which I hear perhaps with too
much Plea&s;ure, from the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>Having been &s;o lately on the Brink of that
State, in which all Di&s;tinctions but that of Good|ne&s;s
are de&s;troy'd, I have not recover'd &s;o much
Laevity, but that I would yet rather hear In|&s;tructions
than Compliments.</P>
<P>If therefore you have ob&s;erv'd in me any
dangerous Tenets, corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions, or crimi|nal
De&s;ires, I conjure you di&s;cover me to my|&s;elf.
Let no fal&s;e Civility re&s;train your Admo|nitions.
Let me know this Evil which can
<PB N="302" REF="304">
&s;trike a good Man with Horror, and which I
dread the more, as I do not feel it.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that a Man of your Order
would be alarm'd at any other Mi&s;ery than Guilt:
Nor will I think &s;o meanly of him who&s;e Di|rection
I have intreated, as to imagine he can
think Virtue unhappy, however overwhelm'd
by Di&s;a&s;ters or Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Keep me therefore no longer in Su&s;pence: I
expect you will exert the Authority of your
Function, and I promi&s;e you on my Part, Sin|cerity
and Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The good Man was now compleatly embar|ra&s;s'd;
he &s;aw his Meaning mi&s;taken, but was
afraid to explain it, left he &s;hould &s;eem to pay
Court by a cowardly Retraction: He therefore
paus'd a little, and <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed he was
&s;tudying for &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as might convey
Cen&s;ure without Offence.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, if you are not yet &s;atisfy'd of
my Willingne&s;s to hear your Reproofs, let me
evince my Docility, by intreating you to con|&s;ider
your&s;elf as di&s;pens'd from all Ceremony
upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Your Imaginations, Madam, reply'd the
Doctor, are too quick for Language; you con|jecture
too &s;oon, what you do not wait to
hear; and rea&s;on upon Suppo&s;itions which can|not
be allow'd you.</P>
<P>When I mention'd my Reflections upon hu|man
Mi&s;ery, I was far from concluding your
Lady&s;hip mi&s;erable, compar'd with the re&s;t of
Mankind; and though contemplating the ab|&s;tracted
<PB N="303" REF="305">
Idea of po&s;&s;ible Felicity, I thought that
even You might be produc'd as an In&s;tance that
it is not attainable in this World, I did not
impute the Imperfection of your State to
Wickedne&s;s, but intended to ob&s;erve, That
though even Virtue be added to external Ad|vantages,
there will yet be &s;omething wanting
to Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;ees you, Madam, will immedi|ately
&s;ay, That nothing can hinder you from
being the happie&s;t of Mortals, but Want of
Power to under&s;tand your own Advantages.
And whoever is admitted to your Conver&s;ation,
will be convinc'd that you enjoy all that Intel|lectual
Excellence can confer; yet I &s;ee you
harra&s;s'd with innumerable Terrors and Per|plexities,
which never di&s;turb the Peace of Po|verty
of Ignorance.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;cover, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> how Po|verty
or Ignorance can be privileg'd from Ca|&s;ualty
or Violence, from the Ravi&s;her, the
Robber, or the Enemy. I &s;hould hope rather
that if Wealth and Knowledge can give no|thing
el&s;e, they at lea&s;t confer Judgment to
fore&s;ee Danger, and Power to oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>They are not indeed, return'd the Doctor,
&s;ecur'd again&s;t real Misfortunes, but they are
happily defended from wild Imaginations:
They do not &s;u&s;pect what cannot happen, nor
figure Ravi&s;hers at a Di&s;tance, and leap into
Rivers to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e then, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I
was frighted without Cau&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="306">
It is certain, Madam, reply'd he, that no
Injury was intended you.</P>
<P>Di&s;ingennuity, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> does not
become a Clergyman&mdash;I think too well of your
Under&s;tanding to imagine your Fallacy de|ceives
your&s;elf: Why then &s;hould you hope that
it will deceive me?</P>
<P>The Laws of Conference require that the
Terms of the Que&s;tion and An&s;wer be the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>I ask, if I had not Cau&s;e to be frighted?
Why then am I an&s;wer'd that no Injury was
intended?</P>
<P>Human Beings cannot penetrate Intentions,
nor regulate their Conduct but by exterior
Appearances. And &s;urely there was &s;ufficient
Appearance of intended Injury, and that the
greate&s;t which my Sex can &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, &s;aid the Doctor, &s;hould you
&s;till per&s;i&s;t in &s;o wild an A&s;&s;ertion?</P>
<P>A coar&s;e Epithet, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> is no
Confutation. It re&s;ts upon you to &s;hew, That
in giving Way to my Fears, even &s;uppo&s;ing
them groundle&s;s, I departed from the Character
of a rea&s;onable Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I am afraid, replied the Doctor, of a Di|&s;pute
with your Lady&s;hip, not becau&s;e I
think my&s;elf in Danger of Defeat, but be|cau&s;e
being accu&s;tom'd to &s;peak to Scholars
with Schola&s;tick Ruggedne&s;s, I may perhaps
depart in the Heat of Argument, from that
Re&s;pect to which you have &s;o great a Right,
and give Offence to a Per&s;on I am really
afraid to di&s;plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="307">
But, if you will promi&s;e to excu&s;e my
Ardour, I will endeavour to prove that you
have been frighted without Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be content, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> to
obtain Truth upon harder Terms, and there|fore
intreat you to begin.</P>
<P>The Apprehen&s;ion of any future Evil, Ma|dam,
&s;aid the Divine, which is called Ter|ror,
when the Danger is from natural Cau&s;es,
and Su&s;picion, when it proceeds from a mo|ral
Agent, mu&s;t always ari&s;e from Compa|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>We can judge of the Future only by the
Pa&s;t, and have therefore only Rea&s;on to fear
or &s;u&s;pect, when we &s;ee the &s;ame Cau&s;es in
Motion which have formerly produc'd Mi&s;|chief,
or the &s;ame Mea&s;ures taken as have
before been preparatory to a Crime.</P>
<P>Thus, when the Sailor in certain Lati|tudes
&s;ees the Clouds ri&s;e, Experience bids
him expect a Storm. When any Monarch
levies Armies, his Neighbours prepare to re|pel
an Inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Power of Progno&s;tication, may, by
Reading and Conver&s;ation, be extended be|yond
our own Knowledge: And the great
U&s;e of Books, is that of participating without
Labour or Hazard the Experience of others.</P>
<P>But upon this Principle how can you find
any Rea&s;on for your late Fright.</P>
<P>Has it ever been known, that a Lady of
your Rank was attack'd with &s;uch Inten|tions,
in a Place &s;o publick, without any
<PB N="306" REF="308">
Preparations made by the Violator for Defence
or E&s;cape?</P>
<P>Can it be imagin'd that any Man would
&s;o ra&s;hly expo&s;e him&s;elf to Infamy by Failure,
and to the Gibbet by Succe&s;s?</P>
<P>Does there in the Records of the World
appear a &s;ingle In&s;tance of &s;uch hopele&s;s Vil|lany?</P>
<P>It is now Time, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,,</HI> to an|&s;wer
your Que&s;tions, before they are too many
to be remembered.</P>
<P>The Dignity of my Birth can very little
defend me again&s;t an In&s;ult to which the
Heire&s;&s;es of great and powerful Empires,
the Daughters of valiant Princes, and the
Wives of renowned Monarchs, have been a
thou&s;and Times expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Danger which you think &s;o great,
would hardly repel a determin'd Mind; for in
Effect, Who would have attempted my Re|&s;cue,
&s;eeing that no Knight or valiant Ca|valier
was within View?</P>
<P>What then &s;hould have hinder'd him from
placing me in a Chariot? Driving it into
the pathle&s;s De&s;art? And immuring me in
a Ca&s;tle, among Woods and Mountains?
Or hiding me perhaps in the Caverns of a
Rock? Or confining me in &s;ome I&s;land of
an immen&s;e Lake?</P>
<P>From all this, Madam, interrupted the
Clergyman, he is hinder'd by Impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="309">
He cannot carry you to any of the&s;e dread|ful
Places, becau&s;e there is no &s;uch Ca&s;tle,
De&s;art, Cavern, or Lake.</P>
<P>You will pardon me, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
it I recur to your own Principles:</P>
<P>You allow that Experience may be gain'd
by Books: And certainly there is no Part
of Knowledge in which we are oblig'd to
tru&s;t them more than in De&s;criptive Geo|graphy.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s Activity in the longe&s;t
Life, can &s;urvey but a &s;mall Part of the
habitable Globe: And the re&s;t can only be
known from the Report of others.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al Negatives are &s;eldom &s;afe, and
are lea&s;t to be allow'd when the Di&s;putes
are about Objects of Sen&s;e; where one Po|&s;ition
cannot be inferr'd from another.</P>
<P>That there is a Ca&s;tle, any Man who
has &s;een it may &s;afely affirm. But you can|not
with equal Rea&s;on, maintain that there
is no Ca&s;tle, becau&s;e you have not &s;een it.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould I imagine that the Face of
the Earth is alter'd &s;ince the Time of tho&s;e
Heroines, who experienc'd &s;o many Changes
of uncouth Captivity?</P>
<P>Ca&s;tles indeed, are the Works of Art;
and are therefore &s;ubject to Decay. But
Lakes, and Caverns, and De&s;arts, mu&s;t always
remain.</P>
<P>And why, &s;ince you call for In&s;tances, &s;hould
I not dread the Misfortunes which happen'd
<PB N="308" REF="310">
to the divine <HI>Clelia,</HI> who was carry'd to one
of the I&s;les of the <HI>Thra&s;ymenian</HI> Lake?</P>
<P>Or tho&s;e which befel the beautiful <HI>Candace,</HI>
Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> whom the Pyrate <HI>Zeno|donus</HI>
wander'd with on the Seas?</P>
<P>Or the Accidents which imbitter'd the Life
of the incomparable <HI>Cleopatra?</HI></P>
<P>Or the Per&s;ecutions which made that of the
fair <HI>Eli&s;a</HI> mi&s;erable?</P>
<P>Or, in fine, the various Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of many
other fair and virtuous Prince&s;&s;es: Such as
tho&s;e which happen'd to <HI>Olympia, Bellamira,
Pari&s;atis, Berenice, Amalagantha, Agione, Al|by&s;inda,
Placidia, A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;inoe, Deidamia,</HI> and a
thou&s;and others I could mention.</P>
<P>To the Names of many of the&s;e illu&s;trious
Sufferers I am an ab&s;olute Stranger, replied the
Doctor.</P>
<P>The re&s;t I &s;aintly remember &s;ome Mention
of in tho&s;e contemptible Volumes, with which
Children are &s;ometimes injudiciou&s;ly &s;uffer'd
to amu&s;e their Imaginations; but which I
little expected to hear quoted by your Lady&s;hip
in a &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And though I am very far from catching
Occa&s;ions of Re&s;entment, yet I think my&s;elf
at Liberty to ob&s;erve, That if I merited your
Cen&s;ure for one indelicate Epithet, we have
engag'd on very unequal Terms, if I may
not likewi&s;e complain of &s;uch contemptuous
Ridicule as you are pleas'd to exerci&s;e upon
my Opinions by oppo&s;ing them with the Au|thority
of Scribblers, not only of Fictions,
<PB N="309" REF="311">
but of &s;en&s;ele&s;s Fictions; which at once vi|tiate
the Mind, and pervert the Un&s;tander|&s;tanding;
and which if they are at any Time
read with Safety, owe their Innocence only to
their Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Books, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> which
you condemn with &s;o much Ardour, though
you acknowledge your&s;elf little acquainted
with them, I have learnt not to recede from
the Conditions I have granted, and &s;hall not
therefore cen&s;ure the Licence of your Lan|guage,
which glances from the Books upon the
Readers.</P>
<P>The&s;e Books, Sir, thus corrupt, thus ob|&s;urd,
thus dangerous alike to the Intellect
and Morals, I have read; and that I hope
without Injury to my Judgment, or my Vir|tue.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who&s;e Vehemence had hin|der'd
him from di&s;covering all the Con&s;equen|ces
of his Po&s;ition, now found him&s;elf entan|gled,
and reply'd in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Tone,</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Madam, my Words imply an
Accu&s;ation very remote from my Intention.</P>
<P>It has always been the Rule of my Life, not
to ju&s;tify any Words or Actions becau&s;e they
mine.</P>
<P>I am a&s;ham'd of my Negligence, I am
&s;orry for my Warmth, and intreat your Lady|&s;hip
to pardon&punc; a Fault which I hope never
to repeat.</P>
<P>The Reparation, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;miling,
over-balances the Offence, and by thus daring
<PB N="310" REF="312">
to own you have been in the Wrong, you
have rais'd in me a much higher E&s;teem for
you.</P>
<P>Yet I will not pardon you, added &s;he,
without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault
you own you have committed; and this Pe|nance
&s;hall be to prove,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the&s;e Hi&s;tories you condemn
are Fictions.</P>
<P>Next, That they are ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>And La&s;tly, That they are Criminal.</P>
<P>The Doctor was pleas'd to find a Reconci|liation
offer'd upon &s;o very ea&s;y Terms, with
a Per&s;on whom he beheld at once with Reve|rence
and Affection, and could not offend
without extreme Regret.</P>
<P>He therefore an&s;wered with a very chearful
Compo&s;ure:</P>
<P>To prove tho&s;e Narratives to be Fictions,
Madam, is only difficult, becau&s;e the Po&s;ition
is almo&s;t too evident for Proof.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip knows, I &s;uppo&s;e to what
Authors the&s;e Writings are a&s;crib'd?</P>
<P>To the <HI>French</HI> Wits of the la&s;t Century,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>And at what Di&s;tance, Madam, are the
Facts related in them from the Age of the
Writer?</P>
<P>I was never exact in my Computation, re|plied
<HI>Arablela;</HI> but I think mo&s;t of the Events
happen'd about two thou&s;and Years ago.</P>
<P>How then, Madam, re&s;um'd the Doctor,
could the&s;e Events be &s;o minutely known to
<PB N="311" REF="313">
Writers &s;o far remote from the Time in which
they happen'd?</P>
<P>By Records, Monuments, Memoirs, and
Hi&s;tories, an&s;wered the Lady.</P>
<P>But by what Accident, then, &s;aid the Doctor
&s;miling, did it happen the&s;e Records and Mo|numents
were kept univer&s;ally &s;ecret to Man|kind
till the la&s;t Century?</P>
<P>What brought all the Memoirs of the re|mote&s;t
Nations and earlie&s;t Ages only to
<HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>Where were they hidden that none could con|&s;ult
them but a few ob&s;cure Authors?</P>
<P>And whither are they now vani&s;hed again
that they can be found no more?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having &s;at &s;ilent a while, told him,
That &s;he found his Que&s;tions very difficult to
be an&s;wer'd; and that though perhaps the Au|thors
them&s;elves could have told whence they
borrowed their Materials, &s;he &s;hould not at
pre&s;ent require any other Evidence of the fir&s;t
A&s;&s;ertion:</P>
<P>But allow'd him to &s;uppo&s;e them Fictions,
and requir'd now that he &s;hould &s;hew them to
be ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip, return'd he, has, I find,
too much Under&s;tanding to &s;truggle again&s;t
Demon&s;tration, and too much Veracity to de|ny
your Convictions; therefore &s;ome of the
Arguments by which I intended to &s;hew the
Fal&s;hood of the&s;e Narratives may be now u&s;ed
to prove their Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="314">
You grant them, Madam, to be Fictions?</P>
<P>Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly, You are
again infringing the Laws of Di&s;putation.</P>
<P>You are not to confound a Suppo&s;ition
of which I allow you only the pre&s;ent U&s;e,
with an unlimited and irrevocable Conce&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I am too well acquainted with my own
Weakne&s;s to conclude an Opinion fal&s;e,
merely becau&s;e I find my&s;elf unable to de|fend
it.</P>
<P>But I am in ha&s;te to hear the Proof of the
other Po&s;itions, not only becau&s;e they may
perhaps &s;upply what is deficient in your Evi|dence
of the fir&s;t, but becau&s;e I think it of
more Importance to detect Corruption than
Fiction.</P>
<P>Though indeed Fal&s;hood is a Species of Cor|ruption,
and what Fal&s;hood is more hateful
than the Fal&s;hood of Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Since you have drawn me back, Madam,
to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, returned the Doctor,
Let me know what Arguments your Lady|&s;hip
can produce for the Veracity of the&s;e
Books.</P>
<P>That there are many Objections again&s;t
it, you your&s;elf have allowed, and the high|e&s;t
moral Evidence of Fal&s;hood appears when
there are many Arguments again&s;t an A&s;&s;ertion,
and none for it.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="315">
Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I &s;hall never think that
any Narrative, which is not confuted by its
own Ab&s;urdity, is without one Argument at
lea&s;t on its Side; there is a Love of Truth in
the human Mind, if not naturally implanted,
&s;o ea&s;ily obtained from Rea&s;on and Expe|rience,
that I &s;hould expect it univer&s;ally to
prevail where there is no &s;trong Temptation to
Deceit; we hate to be deceived, we therefore
hate tho&s;e that deceive us; we de&s;ire not to
be hated, and therefore know that we are not
to deceive. Shew me an equal Motive to
Fal&s;hood, or confe&s;s that every Relation has
&s;ome Right to Credit.</P>
<P>This may be allowed, Madam, &s;aid the Doc|tor,
when we claim to be credited, but that
&s;eems not to be the Hope or Intention of the&s;e
Writers.</P>
<P>Surely Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> you mu&s;t mi&s;|take
their De&s;ign; he that writes without In|tention
to be credited, mu&s;t write to little Pur|po&s;e;
for what Plea&s;ure or Advantage can a|ri&s;e
from Facts that never happened? What
Examples can be afforded by the Patience
of tho&s;e who never &s;uffered, or the Cha&s;tity of
tho&s;e who were never &s;olicited? The great
End of Hi&s;tory, is to &s;hew how much human
Nature can endure or perform. When we
hear a Story in common Life that rai&s;es our
Wonder or Compa&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t Confutation
&s;tills our Emotions, and however we were
touched before, we then cha&s;e it from the Me|mory
with Contempt as a Trifle, or with In|dignation
as an Impo&s;ture. Prove, therefore,
that the Books which I have hitherto read as
<PB N="314" REF="316">
Copies of Life, and Models of Conduct, are
empty Fictions, and from this Hour I deliver
them to Moths and Mould; and from this
Time con&s;ider their Authors as Wretches who
cheated me of tho&s;e Hours I ought to have
dedicated to Application and Improvement,
and betrayed me to a Wa&s;te of tho&s;e Years in
which I might have laid up Knowledge for my
future Life.</P>
<P><HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> &s;aid the Doctor, calls ju&s;t Re|&s;entment
the Child of Integrity, and therefore
I do not wonder, that what Vehemence the
Gentlene&s;s of your Lady&s;hip's Temper allows,
&s;hould be exerted upon this Occa&s;ion. Yet
though I cannot forgive the&s;e Authors for ha|ving
de&s;troyed &s;o much valuable Time, yet I
cannot think them intentionally culpable, be|cau&s;e
I cannot believe they expected to be cre|dited.
Truth is not always injured by Fiction.

The Fables of <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> though never
I &s;uppo&s;e believed, yet have been long con&s;i|dered
as Lectures of moral and dome&s;tic
Wi&s;dom, &s;o well adapted to the Faculties of

honoured his Tran&s;lator with the Appellation
of <HI>Looman</HI> the Wi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317">
The Fables of <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> are a|mong
tho&s;e of which the Ab&s;urdity di&s;covers
it&s;elf, and the Truth is compri&s;ed in the Ap|plication;
but what can be &s;aid of tho&s;e Tales
which are told with the &s;olemn Air of hi&s;tori|cal
Truth, and if fal&s;e convey no In&s;truction?</P>
<P>That they cannot be defended Madam, &s;aid
the Doctor, it is my Purpo&s;e to prove, and if to
evince their Fal&s;hood be &s;ufficient to procure
their Bani&s;hment from your Lady&s;hip's Clo&s;et,
their Day of Grace is near an end. How is
any oral, or written Te&s;timony, confuted or
confirmed?</P>
<P>By comparing it, &s;ays the Lady, with the
Te&s;timony of others, or with the natural Ef|fects
and &s;tanding Evidence of the Facts rela|ted,
and &s;ometimes by comparing it with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If then your Lady&s;hip will abide by this la&s;t,
returned he, and compare the&s;e Books with
antient Hi&s;tories, you will not only find innu|merable
Names, of which no Mention was
ever made before, but Per&s;ons who lived in
different Ages, engaged as the Friends or Ri|vals
of each other. You will perceive that
your Authors have parcelled out the World at
Di&s;cretion, erected Palaces, and e&s;tabli&s;hed
Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of
their Narrative required them, and &s;et Kings
and Queens over imaginary Nations. Nor have
they con&s;idered them&s;elves as inve&s;ted with le&s;s
Authority over the Works of Nature, than the
In&s;titutions of Men; for they have di&s;tributed
Mountains and De&s;arts, Gulphs and Rocks,
wherever they wanted them, and whenever the
Cour&s;e of their Story required an Expedient,
<PB N="316" REF="318">
rai&s;ed a gloomy Fore&s;t, or overflowed the Re|gions
with a rapid Stream.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you have no In|tention
to deceive me, and &s;ince, if what you
have a&s;&s;erted be true, the Cau&s;e is undefen&s;i|ble,
I &s;hall trouble you no longer to argue on
this Topic, but de&s;ire now to hear why, &s;up|po&s;ing
them Fictions, and intended to be re|ceived
as Fictions, you cen&s;ure them as ab|&s;urd?</P>
<P>The only Excellence of Fal&s;hood, an&s;wered
he, is its Re&s;emblance to Truth; as therefore
any Narrative is more liable to be confuted by
its Incon&s;i&s;tency with known Facts, it is at a
greater Di&s;tance from the Perfection of Fic|tion;
for there can be no Difficulty in framing
a Tale, if we are left at Liberty to invert all
Hi&s;tory and Nature for our own Conveniency.
When a Crime is to be concealed, it is ea&s;y
to cover it with an imaginary Word. When
Virtue is to be rewarded, a Nation with
a new Name may, without any Ex|pence
of Invention, rai&s;e her to the Throne.
When <HI>Ario&s;to</HI> was told of the Magnificence of
his Palaces, he an&s;wered, that the Co&s;t of po|etical
Architecture was very little; and
&s;till le&s;s is the Co&s;t of Building without Art,
than without Materials. But their hi&s;torical
Failures may be ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over, when we
con&s;ider their phy&s;ical or philo&s;ophical Ab&s;ur|dities;
to bring Men together from different
Countries does not &s;hock with every inherent or
demon&s;trable Ab&s;urdity, and therefore when
we read only for Amu&s;ement, &s;uch Impropri|eries
may be born: But who can forbear to
<PB N="317" REF="319">
throw away the Story that gives to one Man
the Strength of Thou&s;ands; that puts Life
or Death in a Smile or a Frown; that recounts
Labours and Sufferings to which the Powers
of Humanity are utterly unequal; that disfigures
the whole Appearance of the World, and re|pre&s;ents
every Thing in a Form different from
that which Experience has &s;hewn. It is the
Fault of the be&s;t Fictions, that they teach
young Minds to expect &s;trange Adventures
and &s;udden Vici&s;&s;itudes, and therefore encou|rage
them often to tru&s;t to Chance. A long
Life may be pa&s;&s;ed without a &s;ingle Occur|rence
that can cau&s;e much Surprize, or pro|duce
any unexpected Con&s;equence of great
Importance; the Order of the World is &s;o
e&s;tabli&s;hed, that all human Affairs proceed in
a regular Method, and very little Opportunity
is left for Sallies or Hazards, for A&s;&s;ault or
Re&s;cue; but the Brave and the Coward, the
Sprightly and the Dull, &s;uffer them&s;elves to
be carried alike down the Stream of Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had for &s;ome Time li&s;tened
with a Wi&s;h to interrupt him, now took
Advantage of a &s;hort Pau&s;e. I cannot imagine,
Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that you intend to deceive me,
and therefore I am inclined to believe that you
are your&s;elf mi&s;taken, and that your Applica|tion
to Learning has hindered you from that
Acquaintance with the World, in which the&s;e
Authors excelled. I have not long conver&s;ed
in Public, yet I have found that Life is &s;ub|ject
to many Accidents. Do you count my
late E&s;cape for nothing? Is it to be numbered
among daily and cur&s;ory Tran&s;actions, that a
<PB N="318" REF="320">
Woman flies from a Ravi&s;her into a rapid
Stream?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not, Madam, &s;aid the Doctor,
urge as an Argument the Fact which is at pre|&s;ent
the Subject of Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;hing at the Ab&s;urdity &s;he had
been guilty of, and not attempting any Sub|terfuge
or Excu&s;e, the Doctor found him&s;elf
at Liberty to proceed:</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not imagine, Madam, continued
he, that I intend to arrogate any Superiority,
when I ob&s;erve that your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t &s;uffer
me to decide, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure authoritatively,
whether Life is truly de&s;cribed in tho&s;e Books;
the Likene&s;s of a Picture can only be determin|ed
by a Knowledge of the Original. You
have yet had little Opportunity of knowing the
Ways of Mankind, which cannot be learned
but from Experience, and of which the highe&s;t
Under&s;tanding, and the lowe&s;t, mu&s;t enter the
World in equal Ignorance. I have lived
long in a public Character, and have thought
it my Duty to &s;tudy tho&s;e whom I have under|taken
to admoni&s;h or in&s;truct. I have never
been &s;o rich as to affright Men into Di&s;gui&s;e
and Concealment, nor &s;o poor as to be kept
at a Di&s;tance too great for accurate Ob&s;erva+tion.
I therefore pre&s;ume to tell your Lady|&s;hip,
with great Confidence, that your Wri|ters
have in&s;tituted a World of their own, and
that nothing is more different from a human
Being, than Heroes or Heroines.</P>
<P>I am afraid, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that the
Difference is not in Favour of the pre&s;ent
World.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="321">
That, Madam, an&s;wered he your own
Penetration will enable you to judge when it
&s;hall have made you equally acquainted with
both: I have no de&s;ire to determine a Que&s;tion,
the Solution of which will give &s;o little
Plea&s;ure to Purity and Benevolence.</P>
<P>The Silence of a Man who loves to prai&s;e
is a Cen&s;ure &s;ufficiently &s;evere, &s;aid the
Lady. May it never happen that you &s;hould
be unwilling to mention the Name of <HI>Arabella.</HI>
I hope wherever Corruption prevails in the
World, to live in it with Virtue, or, if I find
my&s;elf too much endanger'd, to retire from it
with Innocence. But if you can &s;ay &s;o little
in Commendation of Mankind, how will
you prove the&s;e Hi&s;tories to be vicious, which
if they do not de&s;cribe real Life, give us an Idea
of a better Race of Beings than now inhabit
the World.</P>
<P>It is of little Importance, Madam, replied
the Doctor, to decide whether in the real or
fictitious Life, mo&s;t Wickedne&s;s is to be
found. Books ought to &s;upply an Antidote
to Example, and if we retire to a contem|plation
of Crimes, and continue in our
Clo&s;ets to inflame our Pa&s;&s;ions, at what time
mu&s;t we rectify our Words, or purify our
Hearts? The immediate Tendency of the&s;e
Books which your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t allow me to
mention with &s;ome Severity, is to give new
Fire to the Pa&s;&s;ions of Revenge and Love;
two Pa&s;&s;ions which, even without &s;uch power|ful
Auxiliaries, it is one of the &s;evere&s;t La|bours
of Rea&s;on and Piety to &s;uppre&s;s, and
which yet mu&s;t be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed if we hope to be
<PB N="320" REF="322">
approved in the Sight of the only Being
where Approbation can make us Happy. I
am afraid your Lady&s;hip will think me too
&s;erious.&mdash;I have already learned too much
from you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> to pre&s;ume to
in&s;truct you, yet &s;uffer me to caution you ne|ver
to di&s;honour your &s;acred Office by the Low|line&s;s
of Apologies. Then let me again ob|&s;erve,
re&s;umed he, that the&s;e Books &s;often the
Heart to Love, and harden it to Murder.
that they teach Women to exact Ven|geance,
and Men to execute it; teach Women to
expect not only Wor&s;hip, but the dteadful
Wor&s;hip of human Sacrifices. Every Page of
the&s;e Volumes is filled with &s;uch extravagance
of Prai&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ions of Obedience as one
human Being ought not to hear from another;
or with Accounts of Battles, in which thou&s;ands
are &s;laughtered for no other Purpo&s;e than to
gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty, who
&s;its a calm Spectatre&s;s of the Ruin and De|&s;olation,
Blood&s;hed and Mi&s;ery, incited by
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to read the&s;e Tales with
out le&s;&s;ening part of that Humility, which
by pre&s;erving in us a Sen&s;e of our Alliance
with all human nature, keeps us awake to Ten|derne&s;s
and Sympathy, or without impairing
that Compa&s;&s;ion which is implanted in us as
an Incentive to Acts of Kindne&s;s. If there be
any pre&s;erved by natural Softne&s;s, or early
Education from learning Pride and Cruelty,
they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the
Vanity of Beauty, and taught the Arts of
Intrigue.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="323">
Love, Madam, is, you know, the Bu&s;ine&s;s, the
&s;ole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Ladies in Romances. <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Blu&s;hes now hinder'd him from proceeding as
he had intended. I perceive, continued, he that
my Arguments begin to be le&s;s agreeable to
your Lady&s;hip's Delicacy, I &s;hall therefore
in&s;i&s;t no longer upon fal&s;e Tenderne&s;s of
Sentiment, but proceed to tho&s;e Outrages of
the violent Pa&s;&s;ions which, though not more
dangerous, are more generally hateful.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that you &s;trengthen by any new Proof a Po&s;i|tion
which when calmly con&s;idered cannot be
denied; my Heart yields to the Force of Truth,
and I now wonder how the Blaze of Enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
Bravery, could hinder me from remark|ing
with Abhorrence the Crime of deliberate
unnece&s;&s;ary Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>I begin to perceive that I have hitherto at
lea&s;t trifled away my Time, and fear that I have
already made &s;ome Approaches to the Crime of
encouraging Violence and Revenge. I hope,
Madam, &s;aid the good Man with Horror in his
Looks, that no Life was ever lo&s;t by your In|citement.
<HI>Arabella</HI> &s;eeing him thus moved,
bur&s;t into Tears, and could not immediately
an&s;wer. Is it po&s;&s;ible, cried the Doctor, that
&s;uch Gentlene&s;s and Elegance &s;hould be &s;tained
with Blood? Be not too ha&s;ty in your Cen&s;ure,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> recovering her&s;elf, I tremble in|deed
to think how nearly I have apprroached
the Brink of Murder, when I thought my&s;elf
only con&s;ulting my own Glory; but whatever
I &s;uffer, I will never more demand or in&s;tigate
Vengeance, nor con&s;ider my Punctilios as
<PB N="322" REF="324">
important enough to be ballanced again&s;t Life.</P>
<P>The Doctor confirmed her in her new Re|&s;olutions,
and thinking Solitude was nece&s;&s;ary
to compo&s;e her Spirits after the Fatigue of &s;o
long a Conver&s;ation, be retired to acquaint Mr
<HI>Glanville</HI> with his Succe&s;s, who in the Tran&s;|port

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Hi&s;tory is concluded.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR <HI>Glanville,</HI> who fancied to him&s;elf the
mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Delight from conver&s;ing
with his lovely Cou&s;in, now recovered to the
free U&s;e of all her noble Powers of Rea&s;on,
would have paid her a Vi&s;it that afternoon,
had not a moments Reflection convinced him
that now was the Time, when her Mind was
labouring under the force of Conviction,
to introduce the repentant Sir <HI>George</HI> to her,
who by confe&s;&s;ing the ridiculous Farce he had
invented to deceive her, might re&s;tore him to
her good Opinion, and add to the Doctor's
&s;olid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ri|dicule
which &s;he would then perceive &s;he had
incurred.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> being now able to leave his Cham|ber,
and <HI>Arabella</HI> well enough recovered to
admit a Vi&s;it in hers, Mr <HI>Glanville</HI> intreated
his Father to wait on her, and get Permi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="323" REF="325">
for Sir <HI>George</HI> to attend her upon a Bu&s;ine&s;s
of &s;ome Con&s;equence. Sir <HI>Charles</HI> no &s;ooner
mentioned this Reque&s;t, than <HI>Arabella</HI> after
a little He&s;itation complied with it. As &s;he
had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars
of Mr <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Quarrels with the young
Baronet, her Thoughts were a little perplex'd
concerning the Occa&s;ion of this Vi&s;it, and
her Embarra&s;sment was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed
by the Confu&s;ion which &s;he perceived in the
Countenance of Sir <HI>George.</HI> It was not
without &s;ome Tokens of a painfully &s;uppre&s;t
Reluctance that Sir <HI>George</HI> con&s;ented to per|form
his Promi&s;e, when Mr <HI>Glanville</HI> claim'd
it, but the Di&s;advantages that would attend
his Breach of it, dejected and humbled as he
now was, pre&s;enting them&s;elves in a forcible
manner to his Imagination, confirmed his
wavering Re&s;olutions. And &s;ince he found
him&s;elf obliged to be his own Accu&s;er, he en|deavoured
to do it with the be&s;t Grace he
could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> all the Artifices her Deception by Ro|mances
had given him Encouragement to
u&s;e upon her, and explaining very explicitly
the la&s;t with relation to the pretended Prince&s;s
of <HI>Gaul,</HI> he &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively a&s;ked her Pardon for
the Offence it would now give her, as well
as for the Trouble it had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> &s;truck with inconceivable Cnfu&s;ion,
having only bowed her Head to his Apology de&s;i|red
to be left alone, and continued for near two
Hours afterwards wholly ab&s;orb'd in the mo&s;t
di&s;agreeable Reflections on the Ab&s;urdity of
her pa&s;t Behaviour, and the Contempt and Ri|dicule
<PB N="324" REF="326">
to which &s;he now &s;aw plainly &s;he had
expo&s;ed her&s;elf. The Violence of the&s;e fir&s;t
Emotions having at length &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he &s;ent
for Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and having
with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the
Follies her vitiated Judgment had led her into,
&s;he apologized to the fir&s;t, for the frequent
Cau&s;es &s;he had given him of Unea&s;ine&s;s; and,
turning to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom &s;he beheld
with a Look of mingled Tenderne&s;s and Mo|de&s;ty,
To give you my&s;elf, with all my re|maining
Imperfections, is making you but a
poor Pre&s;ent in return for the Obligations your
generous Affection has laid me under to you;
yet &s;ince I am &s;o happy as to be de&s;ired for a
Partner for Life by a Man of your Sen&s;e and
Honour, I will endeavour to make my&s;elf as
worthy as I am able of &s;uch a favourable Di|&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> ki&s;&s;ed the Hand &s;he gave him
with an emphatic Silence, while Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
in the mo&s;t obliging Manner imaginable,
thanked her for the Honour &s;he conferred both
on him&s;elf and Son by this Alliance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> entangled in his own Artifices,

that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> were united.</P>
