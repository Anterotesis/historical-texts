<HEAD>LE TOCSIN!
OR THE ADDRESS OF
CITIZEN FAMINE!</HEAD>
<P>KINGS! Mini&s;ters! Lords! Commons! and
Pre&s;sgangs!&mdash;By whatever denomination
ye are known, Oh oppre&s;&s;ors! drop for a moment
the clamour of Corruption, and hearken to the voice
of Truth.</P>
<P>The pa&s;t ages of the World have been the E|pochs
of theory, the pre&s;ent is an Age of practice,
Men begin to act what they formerly thought; an
unaccountable impul&s;e urges the Arm to perform
what the Heart dictates, and no &s;ooner is Tyranny
<PB N="3" REF="3">
known, than the unanimous con&s;ent of Nations
records it for de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Beware, then; the arm of vengeance &s;hall not be
torpid for ever! Man &s;upports oppre&s;&s;ion as long as
his prejudices enable him, but when the increa&s;ing
Weight exceeds his &s;trength, prejudice takes it&s;elf
away, and the oppre&s;&s;ion is tumbled to the earth;
you may make the Blind believe that there is no
Sun, or that it is not at pre&s;ent vi&s;ible; but you
cannot per&s;wade the awakened &s;ight of Rea&s;on that
it is only a Farthing candle, Ari&s;tocratically lighted
up, to illumine and benefit a few.</P>
<P>When Bread is wanting, and when Men are &s;carce,
do not accu&s;e Nature with &s;terility, do not libel
Humanity &s;o much by a&s;&s;erting that de&s;truction is
occa&s;ioned by the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety; Society is
&s;ufficient for it&s;elf, it requires no aid, no Crowned
Auxiliary, and it cannot be the cau&s;e of War or
Mi&s;ery, unle&s;s &s;ome <HI>Extra</HI> Monarchy disjoints the
parts and di&s;unites the members. War is the cau&s;e
of Famine, and Courts are the authors of War, they
write the Hi&s;tory of man in letters of blood, and
Death is their Hi&s;torian! they thin the ranks of
Life, they drive the Hu&s;bandman from the plough
to the camp, and when Corn becomes &s;carce be|cau&s;e
the pea&s;ants cannot cultivate it; they exclaim
Nature has denied her increa&s;e, and men &s;laughter
<PB N="4" REF="4">
one another. Let us con&s;ider for a moment, if
the&s;e things are true.</P>
<P>While a Commercial intercour&s;e exi&s;ts between
the Nations of the Earth, no &s;carcity can ari&s;e to
any nation, becau&s;e the &s;uperfluity of one Country
will always &s;upply the deficiency of another, this
commercial intercour&s;e can only be impeded by the
machinations of Tyrants! Tyrants are therefore the
cau&s;es of Famine. Oh! ye oppre&s;&s;ors of my coun|try,
have you not violated the &s;acred rights of
&s;ocial commerce, and have you not by that means
provoked a reciprocal inju&s;tice. If it was not e|nough
to &s;end our Brothers by thou&s;ands to their
graves, and to make the Fields of Flanders &s;moke
with the gore of our countrymen, &s;urely it was an
unpardonable exce&s;s of cruely to invent a &s;y&s;tem
of &s;tarvation! at once to depopulate the earth, to
barrenize nature, and to invade tho&s;e &s;acred rights
of commerce which have hitherto di&s;tributed the
effects of nature to all the Tenants of the Globe.</P>
<P>Thro' you, de&s;tructive wolves, our children cry
in vain for that &s;u&s;tenance, which the for&s;aken mo|ther
is unable to give them; Thro' your arts, the
la&s;t patience of human nature is exhau&s;ted, and
while hunger impels the in&s;ulted Sons of poverty to
de&s;peration, the ruffians of war, &s;hoot them like
Dogs, and death fini&s;hes that long tale of lingering
<PB N="5" REF="5">
mi&s;ery, which you Tyrants fir&s;t began: Heavens!
&s;hall our exi&s;tence be prolonged, only to make our
&s;ufferings the medium of your pro&s;perity and plea|&s;ure,
&s;hall our &s;canty meals, and hard-earned mor|&s;els
&s;carcely keep together the la&s;t remnants of a
weary being, that you may wallow in Luxury, and
tread with in&s;olence upon the hands that feed you;
No! No! if humanity is to fall, let it fall the Heroe
of nature, and let the dagger of vengeance be the
trophy to celebrate the &s;truggles of expiring Li|berty,
and adorn the &s;epulchre of virtue.</P>
<P>This may be the language of pa&s;&s;ion, but it is al&s;o
the language of Truth; there are many truths di&s;|agreeable
to Statesmen, and none more &s;o than,
tho&s;e which have an effect attatched to the non-ob|&s;ervance
of them; patience appears to me a virtue,
in proportion as avarice and ambition are German
vices; Hanover is the Fountain-head of purgation,
and Johnny Bull can evidence the effects of the
German Spa. However let us remember, that,
tho' it is the <HI>interest</HI> of Hanover to be the receiver
of Gold, it is not his <HI>interest</HI> to take away our
&s;heaves of Corn, &s;ince in that ca&s;e it may be our
<HI>interest</HI> to plant Hemp in&s;tead of Wheat.</P>
<P>Inform me great and awfull Ju&s;tice! which is
guilty, the Monarchs, Mini&s;ters, and Prie&s;ts who
advi&s;e de&s;truction, and murder, and &s;end our Corn
<PB N="6" REF="6">
and Cattle to feed the Whi&s;kered Slaves of Au&s;tria;
or the Pea&s;ant, Mechanic, or Laborer, who impel|led
by Nature's appetites, &s;natches from the Con|tractor
a mor&s;el which they have not bought? who
great Ju&s;tice! de&s;erves mo&s;t to &s;uffer from the Mi|litary
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the day? Ju&s;tice points to the
Crown, to the Robe of Office, and the Mitre,
The Spade, the Anvil and the Loom are greater
ornaments to life,&mdash;the Children of Nature u&s;e
them,&mdash;and whatever Nature produces, is their
Heritage and Right.</P>
<P>It were well if your Red-coat A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins would
cea&s;e to murder for you, for then your Tyranny
would cea&s;e to be. However the Soldier is not
the mo&s;t faithful of your dogs, you feed him upon
hard Cru&s;ts! No &s;ooner &s;hall the People offer him
a better meal, then he will de&s;ert from your stand|ard,
and unite with the People.&mdash;Already the army
is becomming enlightened; Gunpowder will &s;oon
be a u&s;ele&s;s material, and the Soldier will &s;hortly
be exalted from the &s;tate of a Slave into a Man.&mdash;Beware
of that day when the Cap of Liberty &s;hall
be &s;upported by tho&s;e men, whom you now treat
as Slaves! it approaches, and Tyranny trembles
at the quickne&s;s of the &s;tep! Tyranny and Free|dom
have engaged in a race; Tyranny which at fir&s;t
gained upon humanity, thro' the violence of its
progre&s;s, now grows weary, every nerve is exhau|&s;ted,
<PB N="7" REF="7">
and leaning on a broken Sword, it &s;carcely
pants along,&mdash;while Freedom a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mid the &s;houts of
Millions arives triumphant at the Goal.</P>
<P>If this is not warning &s;ufficient to you, apply
your attention to the Vengeance which Public
mi&s;ery is preparing to &s;hower on your heads, look
at the &s;cenes of &s;orrow and &s;tarvation, of which you
are the cau&s;e, and &s;ee the victims of Famine, whom
you have deprived of Bread and Chee&s;e, fea&s;ting on
the ideas of future Ju&s;tice.&mdash;Give them a Peace&mdash;De&s;troy
your Monopolies,&mdash;Reform your Senates,
Di&s;band your A&s;&s;ociations&mdash;Decline your Pen&s;ions,
and then hoping for better days, the in&s;ulted World
may relax its &s;everity, and by comforting the exi&s;t|ence
of others, you may perpetuate your own.</P>
<P>Whenever the thunder of human Ju&s;tice is col|lected
in the rece&s;s of human Sorrow, it is no par|tial
rod erected on the edifice of Tyranny that can
divert the blow,&mdash;Man knows your guilt, he is &s;en|&s;ible
of the Oppre&s;&s;ion with which you goad him,
and he is preparing the Tribunal of Ju&s;tice, to re|tribute
his injuries,&mdash;Exert your caution, make u&s;e
of your Political Arithmetic and &s;ay if it is better
to multiply human Sorrows, and divide &s;ocial con|nections,
or to to reduce the &s;um of mi&s;ery, and
ca&s;t up the general account of our Liberties and
Rights; con&s;ider well, with War, Famine and Op|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="8">
&mdash;come Di&s;cord, Vengeance and De&s;truct|ion.&mdash;with
Peace, Plenty and Principle,&mdash;come
Life, Wealth and Security. Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly, give
us BREAD, or the appetites of Nature will oblige
us to devour you? cea&s;e to Murder us with your
Military, or the Bayonet that &s;lew the unfortunate
victims of Hunger and Poverty, may al&s;o peirce
the Flinty-heart of the wretch, who&s;e being is the
abu&s;&eacute; of life, and who&s;e Tyranny is a Libel upon
the patience of MAN.</P>
