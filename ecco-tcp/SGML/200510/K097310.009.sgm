<HEAD>On the di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 59. I &s;aid, <HI>That the earth is &s;ituated
thirty millions of leagues from the &s;un.</HI> This
was the general opinion of a&s;tronomers in the
year 1745, when I compo&s;ed the treati&s;e on the
formation of the planets. But later ob&s;erva|tions,
and particularly tho&s;e derived from the
<PB N="2" REF="9">
tran&s;it of Venus over the &s;un's di&s;c in 1769,
&s;how that this di&s;tance of thirty millions &s;hould
be augmented three or four millions of leagues.
It is for this rea&s;on that, in the <HI>Epoques de la
Nature,</HI> I have always reckoned the mean di|&s;tance
of the &s;un from the earth to be thirty-three
millions of leagues, in&s;tead of thirty. This
remark was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the &s;u&s;picion
of my having contradicted my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther remark, that the &s;un is not on|ly
thirty-three or thirty-four millions of leagues
di&s;tant from the earth, but, from the &s;ame ob|&s;ervations,
it has likewi&s;e been di&s;covered that
the volume of the &s;un is a tenth part larger
than was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed; and, con&s;equently,
that the whole ma&s;s of the planets is only an
eight hundredth part of that of the &s;un, and not
a &s;ix hundredth and fiftieth part, as I had ad|vanced
from the information we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the
year 1745. This difference &s;trengthens the pro|bability
that the matter of the planets was pro|jected
from the body of the &s;un.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Matter of the Sun and Planets.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD remarked, in p. 65. That <HI>the opaque
bodies of the planets were detached from the lu|minous
matter of which the &s;un is compo&s;ed.</HI>
The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are not correct; for the mat|ter
of the planets, when projected from the &s;un,
was equally luminous as that of the &s;un it&s;elf,
and the planets became not opaque till their
&s;tate of fluid brightne&s;s had cea&s;ed: The dura|tion
of this &s;tate in &s;everal kinds of matter I de|termined
by experiment; and, from analogy, I
calculated the continuation of this bright &s;tate
in each of the planets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See epoques de la nature.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, as the tor|rent
of matter, projected from the body of the
&s;un by the comet, traver&s;ed the immen&s;e atmo&s;|phere
of that luminary, it carried off the vola|tile,
aqueous, and aerial parts of which the &s;eas
and atmo&s;pheres of the different planets are now
compo&s;ed. Hence we may conclude, that the
matter of the planets is the &s;ame, in every re|&s;pect,
with that of the &s;un, and that there is
no other difference but in the degree of heat,
which is extreme in the &s;un, and greater or
&s;maller in the planets, according to the compound
ratio of their thickne&s;s and den&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the relation between the Den&s;ity of the Pla|nets
and their Celerity.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 75. I &s;aid, that, <HI>according to this relation
between the celerity and den&s;ity of the planets,
the den&s;ity of the earth ought not to exceed</HI> 206 7/18,
<HI>in&s;tead of</HI> 400, <HI>which is its real den&s;ity.</HI> The
den&s;ity here a&s;cribed to the earth is too great with
relation to the quickne&s;s of its motion round the
&s;un, and ought to be a little dimini&s;hed for a rea|&s;on
which had formerly e&s;caped me. The
moon, which, in this computation, &s;hould be re+garded
as forming a part of the earth, is le&s;s den&s;e
in the ratio of 702 to 1000, and the lunar globe
is 1/49th of the bulk of the terre&s;trial. Hence, if
the moon were as large as the earth, we &s;hould di|mini&s;h
the den&s;ity of the latter 400 in the ratio
of 1000 to 702, which produces 281, <HI>i. e.</HI> 119 of
diminution in the den&s;ity 400. But, as the moon
is only 1/49th part of the bulk of the earth, it
will produce only 119/49, or 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">/7ths of diminution.
Con&s;equently, the den&s;ity of our globe, with
relation to its celerity, in&s;tead of 206 7/18, ought
to be e&s;timated at 206 7/18 &plus; 2 7/3 <HI>i. e.</HI> nearly 209.
Be&s;ides, we may &s;uppo&s;e that our globe, at the
beginning, was le&s;s den&s;e than it is at pre&s;ent,
and that it is become much more compact both
<PB N="5" REF="12">
by cooling, and by the &s;inking of va&s;t caverns with
which its interior parts abounded. This opi|nion
accords with tho&s;e revolutions which hap|pened,
and &s;till continue to happen, both on the
&s;urface of the earth, and even at con&s;iderable
depths. By the aid of this fact, we are enabled
to explain the po&s;&s;ibility that the waters of the
&s;ea were formerly 2000 fathoms above tho&s;e
parts of the globe which are now inhabited;
for the&s;e waters would &s;till cover the whole &s;ur|face
of the earth, if, by immen&s;e depre&s;&s;ions, dif|ferent
parts had not &s;unk, and formed tho&s;e re|ceptacles
for the waters which at pre&s;ent exi&s;t.</P>
<P>If we &s;uppo&s;e the diameter of the globe to be
2863 leagues, it would be two leagues more
when covered with 2000 fathoms of water.
This difference in the bulk of the earth, produced
by the &s;inking of the waters, gives an augmen|tation
of a 1/477th part of its den&s;ity. This aug|mentation
of the den&s;ity, or diminution of the
bulk of the globe, may be doubled, and perhaps
tripled, by the &s;inking and overturning of moun|tains,
and the con&s;equent filling up of valleys;
&s;o that, &s;ince the waters fell upon the earth, its
den&s;ity may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have increa&s;ed one
hundredth part.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On the relation a&s;&s;igned by Newton between the
den&s;ity of the Planets and the degrees of Heat
to which they are expo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>IN p. 145. I remarked, that, <HI>notwith&s;tanding
the regard due to the conjectures of Newton, I
cannot help thinking that the den&s;ities of the pla|nets
have a nearer relation to their celerities
than to the degrees of heat to which they are ex|po&s;ed.</HI>
From calculating the action of the &s;olar
heat upon the planets, it appears that this heat, in
general, is incon&s;iderable, and that it has never
produced any great change in the den&s;ity of each
planet; for the action of the &s;olar heat, which is
weak in it&s;elf, has no influence on the den&s;ity of
the matter of which the planets are compo&s;ed,
except at their &s;urfaces. It cannot act on the in|ternal
parts, becau&s;e it penetrates to a very &s;mall
depth only. Hence the total den&s;ity of a pla|net
has no relation to the heat tran&s;mitted to it
by the &s;un.</P>
<P>It appears to be certain, therefore, that the
den&s;ity of the planets has no dependence on the
&s;olar heat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> on the contrary, that their den&s;i|ties
have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> relation with their celerities,
which la&s;t increa&s;e or dimini&s;h in proportion to
<PB N="7" REF="14">
their di&s;tances from the &s;un. We have &s;een,
that, at the general projection, the more den&s;e
parts were not removed &s;o far from the &s;un as
the le&s;s den&s;e. Mercury, which is compo&s;ed of
the mo&s;t den&s;e matter projected from the &s;un,
remained in the neighbourhood of that luminary;
while Saturn, which con&s;i&s;ts of the lighte&s;t mat|ter,
is removed to a great di&s;tance from the &s;un:
And, as the mo&s;t di&s;tant planets revolve round
the &s;un with greater celerity than tho&s;e that are
nearer, it follows, that their den&s;ity has a direct
relation with their celerity, and &s;till more with
their di&s;tance from the &s;un. The di&s;tances of
the &s;ix planets from the &s;un are as 4, 7, 10, 15,
52, 95; and their den&s;ities as 2040, 1270, 1000,
730, 292, 184. And, if we &s;uppo&s;e the den&s;i|ties
to be in the inver&s;e ratio of the di&s;tances,
they will be as 2040, 1160, 889&frac12;, 660, 210,
159. This la&s;t relation between their re&s;pective
den&s;ities is perhaps more ju&s;t than the former;
becau&s;e it &s;eems to be founded on the phy&s;ical
cau&s;e which mu&s;t have produced the difference
of den&s;ity in each planet.</P>

<HEAD>On the extent of Terre&s;trial Continents.</HEAD>
<P>PAGE 134. I &s;aid, that <HI>the longe&s;t line which
can be drawn in the ancient Continent is a|bout</HI>
3600 <HI>leagues.</HI> By leagues I mean tho&s;e
u&s;ed in the environs of Paris, which are 2000 or
2100 fathoms long, and about 27 of them make
a degree.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, though in this article of general geo|graphy,
I endeavoured to reach that degree of
exactne&s;s which &s;ubjects of that nature require;
yet a few &s;light errors have e&s;caped me. For
example, 1. I have not u&s;ed the names adopted
or given by the French to &s;everal parts of Ame|rica.
I uniformly followed the Briti&s;h globes
made by Senex, of two feet diameter, from
which my charts were exactly copied. The
Briti&s;h are more ju&s;t than the French, with re|gard
to countries they di&s;cover, or through which
they travel. They pre&s;erve the original name
of each country, or that which was be&s;towed on
it by the fir&s;t di&s;coverers. We, on the contrary,
often give French names to the countries we vi|&s;it,
which is the cau&s;e of that ob&s;curity in
the geographical nomenclature of our language.
But, as the lines which traver&s;e the two Conti|nents
<PB N="9" REF="16">
in their greate&s;t length are well marked,
in my charts, by the two extreme points, and
&s;everal other intermediate ones, who&s;e names are
generally adopted, no e&s;&s;ential ambiguity can a|ri&s;e
from this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>2. I likewi&s;e neglected to give the calculation
of the &s;urface of the two continents, becau&s;e it
is ea&s;ily made on a large globe. But, as many
per&s;ons have expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee this cal|culation,
I here &s;ubjoin that which M. Robert

near one third of the total &s;urface of the globe,
which is about 26 millions of &s;quare leagues.</P>
<P>3. I ought to have mentioned the &s;mall diffe|rence
of inclination that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the two
lines by which I divided the two Continents. I
contented my&s;elf with &s;aying, that they were both
inclined to the Equator, in oppo&s;ite &s;ides, about
30 degrees, which is not the preci&s;e fact; for
that of the Old Continent is a little more than
30 degrees, and that of the New a little le&s;s.
If I had given this explanation, I &s;hould have a|voided
the imputation of having drawn two lines
of unequal lengths, under the &s;ame angle be|tween
two parallels; which would have proved,
as an anonymous critic remarks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettres &agrave; un Americain.</NOTE>, that I am un|acquainted

in not di&s;tingui&s;hing, as I had el&s;ewhere done,
Upper Egypt, which is a very ancient land, from
Lower Egypt, which is a very new territory.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Form of Continents.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the figure of Continents, I
&s;hall tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from the ingenious au|thor
of the Philo&s;ophical and Political Hi&s;tory
of the two Indies.</P>
<P>'It is now thought to be certain,' he remarks,
'that the &s;urface of the New Continent is not
one half of that of the Old. Be&s;ides, in their
figure there are &s;ome &s;triking analogies.&mdash;They
&s;eem to form two immen&s;e bands of earth,
which ari&s;e from the Arctic pole, terminate in
the South, and &s;eparated on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t
by the ocean that inve&s;ts them. Independent
of the &s;tructure of the&s;e two bands, and of the
counterpoi&s;e or &s;ymmetry which takes place in
their figure; it is apparent, that their equili|brium
depends not on their po&s;ition; it is the
fluctuation of the &s;ea which produces the &s;tabi|lity
of the earth. To fix the globe on its ba&s;e, it
was nece&s;&s;ary to have an element which, by
floating continually around this planet, &s;hould
counterbalance, by its weight, the other &s;ub|&s;tances,
and re&s;tore that equilibrium which the
colli&s;ion of the other elements might have di&s;tur|bed.
Water, by its fluidity and gravity, is well
<PB N="13" REF="20">
fitted to &s;upport that harmony and that balance
of the different parts of the globe around its
centre.'</P>
<P>'If the waters which &s;till moi&s;ten the bowels
of the New Hemi&s;phere had not deluged its
&s;urface, man would &s;oon have cut down the
woods, drained the mar&s;hes, and given con&s;i&s;t|ence
to a watery &s;oil.&mdash;He would have opened
vents to the winds, and confined the rivers
within their banks; the climate, of cour&s;e,
would have already been changed. But an
uncultivated and thinly inhabited hemi&s;phere
announces a recent land, while the waters
which environ its coa&s;ts &s;till creep &s;ilently
through its veins.'</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject I &s;hall remark, that, although
there is more water on the &s;urface of America
than on that of other countries, we ought not to
conclude from this circum&s;tance, that an internal
&s;ea is contained in the bowels of this new land.
We &s;hould only infer from this number of lakes,
mar&s;hes, and large rivers, that America has been
peopled long after A&s;ia, Africa, and Europe,
where the quantity of &s;tagnant waters is much
le&s;s. Be&s;ides, a thou&s;and other circum&s;tances
concur in &s;howing, that the Continent of Ameri|ca
in general ought to be regarded as new land,
in which Nature has not had time to acquire all
her powers, nor to exhibit them by a numerous
population.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Terra Au&s;tralis, p. 140.</HEAD>
<P>To what I have &s;aid concerning the Terra
Au&s;tralis, I &s;hall add, that, within the&s;e few years,
new attempts have been made to di&s;cover it, and
that &s;ome points of it have been found after de|parting
either from the Cape of Good Hope, or
from the I&s;le of France; but that the&s;e new
voyagers have uniformly met with thick fogs,
&s;now, and ice, in the 46th or 47th degree of
South latitude. After conver&s;ing with &s;ome of
the&s;e voyagers, and collecting all the informa|tion
I could derive from other &s;ources, I percei|ved
that they all agreed with regard to this fact,
and that they found ice in much lower latitudes
than is to be met with in the northern hemi|&s;phere.
They likewi&s;e uniformly met with fogs
in the &s;ame latitudes where they found ice,
though it was &s;ummer in the&s;e climates at the
time the experiments were made. It is, there|fore,
extremely probable, that, below the 50th
degree, it will be in vain to &s;earch for temperate
countries in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, where the
freezing cold is much farther extended than in
the northern. The thick fog is produced by
the pre&s;ence or neighbourhood of the ice. This
<PB N="15" REF="22">
fog con&s;i&s;ts of minute particles of &s;now, which
are &s;u&s;pended in the air, and render it ob&s;cure:
It often accompanies the great floating ma&s;&s;es of
ice, and reigns perpetually in frozen regions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Briti&s;h have lately &s;ailed round
New Holland as well as New Zealand. The&s;e
&s;outhern countries are more exten&s;ive than the
whole of Europe. New Zealand is divided into
&s;everal i&s;lands; but New Holland ought rather
to be regarded as a part of A&s;ia, than as an i&s;land
belonging to the Southern Continent; for New
Holland is only &s;eparated from the land of the
Papous, or New Guiney, by a narrow &s;trait, and
the whole Archipelago, which extend &s;outhward
from the Philippine i&s;les, as far as the country of
Arnhem in New Holland, and toward the we&s;t
and &s;outh, as far as Sumatra and Java, appears
to belong as much to the Continent of New Hol|land,
as to the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Captain Cook, who ought to be regarded as
the greate&s;t navigator of this age, and to whom
we are indebted for an infinite number of new di&s;|coveries,
has not only given a chart of the coa&s;ts
of Zealand and New Holland, but has likewi&s;e
explored an immen&s;e tract of the &s;outh &s;ea in
the neighbourhood of America. He departed
from the &s;outh point of America on the 30th of
January 1769, and he traver&s;ed a great part of
the ocean under the 60th degree, without di&s;co|vering
any land. From Captain Cook's chart
<PB N="16" REF="23">
we may perceive the great extent of &s;ea which
he explored; and his tract demon&s;trates, that, if
any lands exi&s;t in this part of the globe, they mu&s;t
be far removed from the Continent of A|merica;
for New Zealand, which is &s;ituated be|tween
the 35th and 45th degrees, is very di&s;tant
from America. But it is &s;till to be hoped, that
other navigators, following the tract of Captain
Cook, will traver&s;e the &s;outhern ocean under the
50th degree, and that they will di&s;cover whether
the&s;e immen&s;e regions, which extend more than
two thou&s;and leagues, con&s;i&s;t of land or of &s;ea.
However, I do not imagine that the &s;outhern
regions, beyond the 50th degree, are &s;o tempe|rate
that any advantage could be derived to us
from the di&s;covery of them.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning the invention of the Mariner's Com|pa&s;s,
p. 153.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the invention of the Mariner's
Compa&s;s, I have to add, that, from the te&s;ti|mony
of Chine&s;e authors, of which M. le Rou&s;e
and M. de Guignes have made an abridgement,
it appears to be certain, that the polarity of the
magnetic needle has been very anciently known
to the inhabitants of China. The figure of the&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="24">
fir&s;t compa&s;&s;es was tho&s;e of a man, who turned
upon a pivot, and who&s;e right arm pointed to
the &s;outh. The time of this invention, accor|ding
to certain Chine&s;e chronicles, was 11 15 years
before the Chri&s;tian aera, and, according to o|thers,
2700<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l'Extrait des Annales de la China, par Mrs Rou&s;e and de Guignes.</NOTE>. But, notwith&s;tanding the anti|quity
of this di&s;covery, it does not appear that
the Chine&s;e had ever derived from it the advan|tage
of making long voyages.</P>
<P>Homer, in the Ody&s;&s;ey, tells us, that the
Greeks employed the load&s;tone to direct their
navigation when they went to be&s;iege Troy;
and this aera is nearly the &s;ame with that re|corded
in the Chine&s;e Chronicle. Hence we
can no longer doubt, that the direction of the
load&s;tone toward the pole, and even the u&s;e of
the mariner's compa&s;s in navigation, were known
to the ancients at lea&s;t three thou&s;and years ago.</P>

<HEAD>Of the di&s;covery of America, p. 155.</HEAD>
<P>To what I &s;aid, p. 155. concerning the di&s;co|very
of America, a critic of more judgment than
the author of <HI>Lettres &agrave; un Am&eacute;ricain,</HI> has ac|cu&s;ed
me of doing a kind of injury to the me|mory
of &s;o great a man as Chri&s;topher Colum|bus.
<PB N="18" REF="25">
'It is confounding,' he remarks, 'Co|lumbus
with his &s;ailors, to think that he could
believe the &s;ea ro&s;e toward the &s;ky, and that
they perhaps touched each other on the &s;outh|ern
part of the globe.' This critici&s;m is ex|tremely
ju&s;t. I ought to have &s;oftened this fact,
which I had extracted from &s;ome hi&s;torical re|lation;
for this great navigator, it is to be pre|&s;umed,
mu&s;t have had very di&s;tinct notions con|cerning
the figure of the earth, which he deri|ved
both from his own voyages, and from tho&s;e
of the Portugue&s;e to the Cape of Good Hope
and the Ea&s;t Indies. It is well known, howe|ver,
that Columbus, when he arrived at the
New Continent, thought him&s;elf at no great di|&s;tance
from the ea&s;t coa&s;ts of A&s;ia. As no man,
at that period, had circumnavigated the world,
he could not know its circumference, and did not
imagine that the earth was &s;o exten&s;ive as it has
been demon&s;trated by later di&s;coveries. Be|&s;ides,
it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that this fir&s;t
navigator toward the we&s;t, could not fail to be
a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that, when below the Antil|les,
it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to gain the &s;outh|ern
regions, and that he was continually forced
back. This ob&s;tacle &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. We cannot,
in any &s;ea&s;on, &s;ail directly from the Antilles to
Guiana; becau&s;e the currents are extremely ra|pid,
and con&s;tantly run from Guiana to tho&s;e
i&s;lands. Ships &s;ail from Guiana to the Antilles
in five or &s;ix days; but they require two months
<PB N="19" REF="26">
to return. In order to return, they are obliged
to make a large circuit toward the Old Conti|nent,
from whence they direct their cour&s;e to|ward
the Terra Firma of South America. The&s;e
rapid and perpetual currents from Guiana to the
Antilles are &s;o violent that they cannot be &s;ur|mounted
by the aid of the wind; and, as this
circum&s;tance is unexampled in the Atlantic o|cean,
it is not &s;ur&s;pri&s;ing that Columbus, who,
notwith&s;tanding all the re&s;ources of his genius
and knowledge in the art of navigation, could
not advance toward the &s;outhern regions, &s;hould
think that &s;omething of a very extraordinary
nature exi&s;ted in this place, and perhaps that
there was a greater elevation in this part of the
&s;ea than in any other; for the currents from
Guiana to the Antilles actually run with as
much rapidity as if they de&s;cended from a height.</P>
<P>The motion of the following rivers, may give
ri&s;e to the currents from Cayenne to the An|tilles.</P>
<P>1. The impetuous river of the Amazons,
who&s;e mouth is &s;eventy leagues broad, and its
direction more to the North than the South.</P>
<P>2. The river Oua&s;&s;a is likewi&s;e rapid, has the
&s;ame direction, and its mouth is nearly a league
wide.</P>
<P>3. The Oyapok is &s;till more rapid than the
Oua&s;&s;a, pa&s;&s;es through a greater tract of land,
and its mouth is nearly of the &s;ame dimen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27">
4. The Aprouak has nearly the &s;ame extent
of cour&s;e and of mouth as the Oua&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>5. The river Kaw is le&s;s exten&s;ive both in
its cour&s;e and mouth; but, though it i&s;&s;ues from
a Savannah about twenty-five or thirty leagues
from the &s;ea, it is extremely rapid.</P>
<P>6. The Oyak, which is a con&s;iderable river,
divides into two branches at its mouth, and
forms the i&s;land of Cayenne. This river, at the
di&s;tance of twenty or twenty-five leagues, re|ceives
another called Oraput; it is very impe|tuous,
and derives its &s;ource from a mountain of
rocks, from whence it de&s;cends in rapid torrents.</P>
<P>7. One branch of the Oyak runs, near its
mouth, into the river of Cayenne; and the&s;e
two rivers, when united, are more than a
league broad; the other branch exceeds not half
a league.</P>
<P>8. The river of Kourou, which is very rapid,
and not above half a league wide at the mouth,
without reckoning the Macou&s;ia, which, though
it furni&s;hes much water, comes from no great
di&s;tance.</P>
<P>9. The Sinamari is an impetuous river; it
comes from a great di&s;tance, and its bed is pret|ty
narrow.</P>
<P>10. The river Maroni, though it be very ra|pid,
comes from a great di&s;tance. Its mouth is
more than a league broad, and, next to the A|mazon,
it di&s;charges the greate&s;t quantity of
<PB N="21" REF="28">
water. It gives ri&s;e to no i&s;lands; while the
mouths of the Amazon and Oronoko are inter|&s;per&s;ed
with a great number.</P>
<P>11. The rivers of Surinam, of Barbich&eacute;, of
E&s;&s;equeb&eacute;, and &s;ome others, till we reach the
Oronoko, which is a very large river.</P>
<P>By the accumulations of mud and of earth
brought down from the mountains by the&s;e ri|vers,
it &s;hould appear, all the valleys of this
va&s;t continent have been formed; in the middle
of the continent there are &s;ome mountains, mo&s;t
of which have formerly been volcanoes, and
are not &s;ufficiently elevated to allow their &s;um|mits
to be covered with &s;now or ice.</P>
<P>Hence it is apparent, that the united force of
all the&s;e rivers gives ri&s;e to that general current
of the &s;ea from Cayenne, or rather from the
Amazon, to the Antilles; and that this general
current extends, perhaps, above &s;ixty leagues
from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Guiana.</P>

<P>'Below the vegetable &s;oil, which exceeds

with &s;tones of the nature of grind-&s;tone. . . . .
In &s;ome di&s;tricts, we meet with detached ma&s;|&s;es

<P>'Below this &s;and, we find a tufa, from ten
or twelve, to thirty, forty, and even fifty feet
thick. This tufa is not commonly of one e|qual
thickne&s;s. It is frequently cut by diffe|rent
&s;trata of &s;purious or clayey marl, of the
<HI>cos</HI> which the workmen call <HI>tripoli,</HI> or of good

are &s;ucceded by one of about ten feet, both the
&s;urface and interior parts of which are inter|&s;per&s;ed
with moulds or impre&s;&s;ions of &s;hells.
It is followed by another about four feet,
which re&s;ts upon one from &s;even to eight, or
rather upon two of three or four feet. After
the&s;e beds, there are &s;everal others, which
together form a ma&s;s of at lea&s;t three fathoms.
This ma&s;s, after piercing a bed of &s;and, is &s;uc|ceeded
by clays.'</P>
<P>'This bed of &s;and is earthy and reddi&s;h, and
is from two and a half to three feet thick.
After this comes a bed of &s;purious clay of a

&s;and; the thickne&s;s of this bed is about two
feet, and is followed by another of five, which
con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mooth black clay, the broken
portions of which are nearly as brilliant as jet.
La&s;tly, this black clay is &s;ucceeded by a blue,
which forms a &s;tratum from five to &s;ix feet

<P>The &s;oil of Lorrain is divided into two great

as granite, porphyry, ja&s;per, and quarts, di&s;po|&s;ed

there is not the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of any
marine production; and the hills which pro|ceed
from them con&s;i&s;t of vitrifiable &s;and.
Where they terminate, and upon a continued
bounding line of their de&s;cent, the other zone
commences, which is totally calcareous, di&s;po|&s;ed
<PB N="28" REF="35">
in horizontal beds, and replete, or rather

<P>The banks and beds of the earth in Peru are
perfectly horizontal, and corre&s;pond &s;ometimes
at a great di&s;tance in different mountains, mo&s;t
of which are two or three hundred fathoms
high. They are in general inacce&s;&s;ible, and of|ten
as perpendicular as walls, which gives us
an opportunity of perceiving the extremities of
their horizontal &s;trata. When any of them
happens to be round and detached from others,
each bed appears like a very flat cylinder, or a
&s;ection of a cone of no great height. The&s;e dif|ferent
beds, placed one above another, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by their colour and various contours,
often re&s;emble a regular and artificial &s;tructure.
In this country, we &s;ee the mountains perpetu|ally

of domes. They are &s;ometimes fortifications
compo&s;ed of long curtins, and defended with
bulwarks. After examining the&s;e objects, and
the corre&s;pondence of their &s;trata, we can hard|ly
entertain a doubt, that the circumjacent land
has not, at &s;ome period, been really &s;unk. It
appears, that tho&s;e mountains, who&s;e ba&s;es were
mo&s;t &s;olidly &s;upported, remained as monuments

<P>The mountain of Birds, called in Arabic <HI>Ge|beliter,</HI>

The removal of the &s;oil, by the movement

<HEAD>Of the interior Rock of the Globe.</HEAD>
<P>In p. 179. I remarked, that <HI>&s;olid rocks are
often &s;upported by beds of earth, clay, or &s;and,
which have much le&s;s &s;pecific gravity. This is
the ca&s;e with mo&s;t hills, and is ea&s;ily perceived.
But, in high mountains, the &s;ummits are not only
rocks, but the&s;e rocks are &s;upported by others;
and this &s;tructure runs through &s;uch an extent of
country, where one mountain ri&s;es out of another,
that it is difficult to determine whether they are
founded on earth, or of what nature this earth is.
I have &s;een rocks cut perpendicularly for &s;ome
hundreds of feet; but the&s;e rocks re&s;ted upon other
rocks, without my being able to perceive where
they ended. May we not, however, be allowed
to conclude from the le&s;s to the greater? Since
the rocks of &s;mall mountains, the ba&s;es of which
are vi&s;ible, re&s;t upon earths le&s;s heavy and le&s;s
&s;olid than &s;tone, is it not rea&s;onable to think, that
earth is likewi&s;e the ba&s;is of high mountains?</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge that this conjecture, derived
from analogy, is &s;ufficiently founded. The
conjecture I then hazarded was written thirty-four
years ago. Since that time, I have acqui|red
ideas and collected facts which convince me,
<PB N="31" REF="38">
that the great mountains compo&s;ed of vitre&s;cent
materials, and produced by the action of the
primitive fire, are connected immediately with
the interior rock of the globe, which is al&s;o a
vitreous rock of the &s;ame kind. The&s;e great
mountains are a part of this immen&s;e rock, and
are only prolongations or eminences formed up|on
the &s;urface of the globe at the time of its
con&s;olidation. Hence we ought to regard them
as con&s;tituent parts of the original ma&s;s of the
earth. But the hills or &s;maller mountains,
which re&s;t upon clay or vitrifiable &s;and, have
been formed by the motion and &s;ediments of
the waters, at a time long po&s;terior to the for|mation
of the great mountains by the primitive
&s;ire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The internal parts of the primitive mountains which I have penetrated, either in pits or in the galleries of mines, to the depth of twelve and fifteen hundred feet, are entirely com|po&s;ed of <HI>pure</HI> vitreous <HI>rock,</HI> in which there are &s;light and irre|gular fi&s;&s;ures, through which the water i&s;&s;ues, and vitriolic and metallic &s;olutions. From this fact we may conclude, that the whole nucleus of the&s;e mountains is a pure rock, adhering to the primitive ma&s;s of the globe. We indeed find, upon their &s;ides, and upon the margins of the valleys, ma&s;&s;es of clayey earth, and banks of calcareous &s;tones, at con&s;iderable depths. But the&s;e are only the remains of tho&s;e materials which filled up the cavities of the earth, and mu&s;t be referred to the &s;econd epoch of Nature; <HI>Note communicated by M. de Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug.</HI> 6. 1777.</NOTE>.

are not of the highe&s;t kind, but of a mean

<HEAD>Of the Vitrification of Calcareous Sub&s;tances.</HEAD>
<P>In page 184. I &s;aid, that <HI>calcareous bodies are
alone incapable of being vitrified, and &s;eem to
form a di&s;tinct cla&s;s. All other &s;ub&s;tances may
be converted into gla&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I had not then made tho&s;e experiments which
have &s;ince convinced me, that calcareous &s;ub|&s;tances,
like all others, may be reduced to
gla&s;s. To produce this effect, nothing more is
nece&s;&s;ary than a fire more violent than that of
our common furnaces. I reduced lime-&s;tone to
gla&s;s by a good burning gla&s;s. Be&s;ides, M. d'Ar|cet,
an able chymi&s;t, melted calcareous &s;par,
without the addition of any other matter, by
means of a porcelain furnace belonging to M. le
Compte de Lauragais. But the&s;e operations
were performed &s;everal years after the publica|tion
of my <HI>Theory of the earth.</HI> I knew only
that, in the iron furnaces, the light, white,
&s;pungy matter, &s;imilar to pumice-&s;tone, which
i&s;&s;ues from them when over-heated, is nothing
<PB N="33" REF="40">
but a vitreous &s;ub&s;tance, proceeding from the
calcareous bodies thrown into the furnace to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
the fu&s;ion of the iron-ore. The &s;ole diffe|rence
between the vitrification of calcareous and
vitre&s;cent &s;ub&s;tances is, that the latter are immedi|ately
vitrified by the action of a violent fire a|lone;
but calcareous bodies, before they are vi|trified,
pa&s;s through a &s;tate of calcination, and
form a line. But, like all other &s;ub&s;tances, they
vitrify, even in our common furnaces, whene|ver
they are mixed with vitre&s;cent matters, e|&s;pecially
with tho&s;e which, like the <HI>aubu&euml;,</HI> or
&s;limy earth, yield mo&s;t ea&s;ily to the fire. Hence
we may &s;afely conclude, that, in general, every
material of which this globe is compo&s;ed, may
be reduced to its primitive &s;tate of gla&s;s, if a
&s;ufficient degree of heat is applied.</P>

I acknowledge, that I &s;hould rather have ta|ken
no notice of this opinion, than revived it
with a je&s;t, e&s;pecially as humour is not my ta|lent,
and as this is perhaps the only example
of plea&s;antry in all my works. M. de Voltaire is
a man who&s;e &s;uperiority of genius merits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This apology was publi&s;hed in the year 1778.</NOTE> the
highe&s;t regard. I was furni&s;hed with this letter
at the very time I was correcting the &s;heet which
contains the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion. I read part of
it only, imagining it to be the production of
&s;ome learned Italian, who, from mere hi&s;torical
<PB N="35" REF="42">
knowledge, had followed his own prejudices,
without con&s;ulting Nature; and it was not till
after my volume on the Theory of the Earth was
printed, that I knew the letter was written by
M. de Voltaire. I then &s;incerely regretted the
expre&s;&s;ions I had u&s;ed. This truth I thought it
incumbent on me to make public, as well for the
&s;ake of M. de Voltaire, as for my own and that
of po&s;terity, to whom I would not leave a doubt
of the high e&s;teem I have always had for a man
of &s;uch uncommon talents, and who has done
&s;o much honour to human nature and to the age
in which he lived.</P>
<P>As the authority of M. de Voltaire made an
impre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ome per&s;ons, others have en|deavoured
to di&s;cover whether his objection,
with regard to the &s;hells found below ground,
has any foundation. Upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall
&s;ubjoin an extract of a memoir which was tran&s;|mitted
to me, and which appears to have been
written with that intention.</P>
<P>In traver&s;ing the different provinces of France,
and even of Italy, 'I every where &s;aw,' le P.
Chabenat remarks, 'figured &s;tones; and, in par|ticular
places, their number was &s;o great, and
they were arranged in &s;uch a manner, that it
was impo&s;&s;ible not to be &s;atisfied, that the&s;e parts
of the earth had formerly been covered with
the &s;ea. I &s;aw &s;hells of every kind, which were
perfectly &s;imilar both in figure and &s;ize to tho&s;e
which now exi&s;t. This ob&s;ervation was &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="36" REF="43">
to convince me, that all the&s;e individuals
were of different ages, but of the &s;ame &s;pecies.
I &s;aw cornua ammonis from half an inch to
near three fect in diameter. I &s;aw cockles of all
&s;izes, as well as other bivalves and univalves. I
likewi&s;e &s;aw belemnites,' &s;ea mu&s;hrooms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>'The form and number of the&s;e figured &s;tones
prove, in the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible manner, that
they were formerly animals which exi&s;ted
in the ocean. The &s;hells with which the
moulds are covered &s;eem to remove every
doubt upon this &s;ubject; for, in particular &s;pe|cimens,
it is equally lu&s;trous, fre&s;h, and natu|ral,
as in the living animal. If &s;eparated from
the mould or nucleus, we could not believe
that it was petrified. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is
applicable to many other figured &s;tones found
in that beautiful and exten&s;ive plain, which
&s;tretches from Montauban to Toulou&s;e, and
from Toulou&s;e to Alby, as well as to the cir|cumjacent
places. The whole of this va&s;t plain
is covered with vegetable &s;oil from half a foot
to two feet thick. Below the &s;oil there is a bed
of coar&s;e gravel about two feet in thickne&s;s.
The gravel is &s;ucceeded by a bed of fine &s;and,
which is nearly of an equal thickne&s;s; and the
rock lies immediately under this bed of &s;and. I
have repeatedly examined the gravel with the
greate&s;t attention, and I found it inter&s;per&s;ed
with an infinite number of figured &s;tones of
<PB N="37" REF="44">
the &s;ame form, but of various &s;izes. I likewi&s;e
found a number of &s;ea hedge-hogs, and other
&s;tones of a regular figure, and perfectly &s;imi|lar.
All the&s;e facts announce, in language the
mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, that this country, as well as
many others, had formerly been the bottom of
the &s;ea, which, by &s;ome &s;udden revolution, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

In Mount Gannelon, near Anet, and at &s;ome

<P>M. Altman remarks, that, in one of the

where the famous glaciers (Gletchers) are form|ed,
there are fine marble quarries, which he
has repre&s;ented in one of the engravings of
the&s;e mountains. The marble quarries are only
a few paces di&s;tant from the glacier. The mar|ble
<PB N="43" REF="50">
is of various colours, as white, yellow, ja&s;per,
red, and green. The marble is drawn on &s;ledges
above the &s;now as far as Under&s;een, where they

Thorne, and afterwards by the river Are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ai de la de&s;cription des Alpes glaciales, par M. Alt|man.</NOTE>.
Thus marble and calcareous &s;tones are found,
at great heights, in this part of the Alps.</P>
<P>M. Cappeler, in making re&s;earches on Mount
Grim&s;el, one of the Alps, has remarked, that
the hills and &s;maller mountains which limit the
valleys, are mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of free-&s;tone, of
a grain more or le&s;s fine and clo&s;e. The tops
of the&s;e mountains generally con&s;i&s;t of lime|&s;tone,
of various colours and hardne&s;s. The
mountains more elevated than the&s;e calcareous
rocks, are compo&s;ed of granite and other &s;tones,
which appear to be of the nature of granite and
of emery. It is in the&s;e granity &s;tones that rock|cry&s;tal
begins to be formed. But, in the lime|&s;tone
rocks below, we find nothing but &s;par
and calcareous concretions. In general, it has
been remarked, concerning &s;hells of every kind,
whether fo&s;&s;il or petrified, that certain &s;pecies
are always found together, and that others are
never met with in the&s;e places. The &s;ame thing
happens in the ocean, where particular &s;pecies
of te&s;taceous animals are con&s;tantly found toge|ther,

<P>It has been too generally believed, that, there
are no &s;hells, or other productions of the &s;ea,
on the highe&s;t mountains. It is true, that there
are &s;everal &s;ummits, and a great number of peaks,
which are entirely compo&s;ed of granite and vitrifi|able
rocks, and in which no mixture can be per|ceived.
The&s;e contain neither the moulds of &s;hells,
nor the relicks of any marine bodies. But there
is a much greater number of mountains, and
&s;ome of them very high, where the&s;e relicks
are to be found. M. Co&s;ta, profe&s;&s;or of anato|my
and botany in the univer&s;ity of Perpignan,
in the year 1774, di&s;covered, &s;ome fathoms be|low
the top of Mount Nas, &s;ituated in the mid|dle
of the Spani&s;h Cerdagne, and one of the mo&s;t
elevated parts of the Pyrennees, a great number
of lenticular &s;tones, <HI>i. e.</HI> blocks compo&s;ed of
lenticular &s;tones, and the&s;e blocks were of dif|ferent
figures and different &s;izes; the large&s;t
might weigh from forty to fifty pounds. He
remarked, that the part of the mountain where
the&s;e lenticular &s;tones were found, &s;eemed to
have formerly &s;unk; for, in this place, he &s;aw
an irregular, oblique depre&s;&s;ion, very much in|clined
to the horizon; and one of its extremities
re&s;pected the top, and the other the bottom of
<PB N="45" REF="52">
the mountain. He could not di&s;tinctly perceive
the dimen&s;ions of this depre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e mo&s;t
of it was covered with &s;now, though it was the
month of Augu&s;t. The banks of rocks which
&s;urrounded the&s;e lenticular &s;tones, as well as
tho&s;e immediately below, are calcareous for
more than a hundred fathoms. This Mount
Nas, to judge of it by the eye, &s;eems to be as
high as Canigou, and pre&s;ents no ve&s;tige of a
volcano.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and other examples of marine &s;hells,
found in an infinity of places, as well in France
as in different parts of Europe, might be given.
But &s;uch an enumeration of particular facts,
which are already too much multiplied, would
&s;well this work, without an&s;wering any u&s;eful
purpo&s;e. From the whole, however, we can|not
refrain from drawing this obvious conclu|&s;ion,
that all the inhabited parts of the earth
have formerly, and during a very long cour&s;e
of time, been covered with the waters of the
ocean.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only remark, that the&s;e &s;ea-&s;hells are
found in different &s;tates. Some of them are
petrifactions, or &s;tones moulded into the form
of &s;hells; and others are in the &s;ame &s;tate as
they &s;till exi&s;t in the ocean. The quantity of
petri&s;ied &s;hells, which are nothing but &s;tones
figured by &s;hells, is infinitely greater than that
of fo&s;&s;il &s;hells, and they are never found toge|ther,
<PB N="46" REF="53">
nor even in places contiguous; it is only
in the neighbourhood, and &s;ome leagues di|&s;tant
from the &s;ea, that we find beds of &s;hells
in their natural &s;tate, and the&s;e are commonly
the &s;ame with tho&s;e which exi&s;t in the adjacent
&s;eas. Petrified &s;hells, on the contrary, are
found, almo&s;t every where, at great di&s;tances
from the &s;ea, and on the highe&s;t hills, many
&s;pecies of which belong not to our &s;eas, and &s;eve|ral
of them have no exi&s;ting repre&s;entatives; &s;uch
as tho&s;e ancient &s;pecies we formerly mentioned,
which only exi&s;ted when the globe was much
warmer. Of more than a hundred &s;pecies of
cornua ammonis, remarks one of our learned A|cademicians,
with which we are acquainted, and
which are found in the environs of Paris, of
Rouen, of Dive, of Langres, and of Lyons, as

and &s;everal other places, &s;eem to confirm

could po&s;&s;ibly belong.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this pa&s;&s;age I have to make two impor|tant
remarks:</P>
<P>1. That the&s;e cornua ammonis, which are &s;o
different from each other both in figure and
<PB N="48" REF="55">
&s;ize, &s;eem to form rather a genus than a &s;pecies
in the cla&s;s of &s;hell animals, are really the re|licks
of &s;o many &s;pecies which have peri&s;hed,
and no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t. I have &s;een &s;ome of
them &s;o &s;mall, that they exceed not a line, and
others &s;o large that they were more than three
feet in diameter. Ob&s;ervers worthy of credit
have a&s;&s;ured me, that that they have &s;een &s;ome
&s;till larger, and particularly one of eight feet in
diameter, and one foot thick. The&s;e different
cornua ammonis &s;eem to form di&s;tinct &s;pecies.
Some of them are more or le&s;s fluted. They
are all &s;piral; but they terminate differently,
both at their centres and at their extremities.
The&s;e animals, formerly &s;o numerous, are no
longer found in any of our &s;eas. They are
known to us by their relicks only; and the im|men&s;ity
of their number cannot be better repre|&s;ented
than by an example which I have daily
before my eyes. In the iron mine near Etivey,
(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> leagues from my forge of Buffon), which
has been wrought 150 years, and has &s;upplied
the iron works of Ai&s;y during all that time,
there are &s;uch quantities of cornua ammonis,

&s;hells are &s;o different in &s;ize, that they
weigh from a drachm to two hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de phy&s;ique de M. Grignon, p. 378.</NOTE>.
Other places might be mentioned where they
equally abound. In the &s;ame manner, we find
belemnites, lenticular &s;tones, and moulds of
many other &s;hells, which now no longer exi&s;t
in any part of the ocean, though they are al|mo&s;t
univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed over the &s;urface of the
earth. I am per&s;uaded that all the&s;e lo&s;t &s;pecies
formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during the time that the tem|perature
of the earth and waters was warmer
than it is at pre&s;ent; and that, in proportion as
the globe cools, other &s;pecies, which now exi&s;t,
will peri&s;h like the former, for want of heat
&s;ufficient to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>2. That &s;ome of tho&s;e enormous bones,
which I thought had belonged to unknown ani|mals,
who&s;e &s;pecies was &s;uppo&s;ed to be lo&s;t,

<P>By comparing the heights of the mountains
of South America with tho&s;e of our Continent,
we will perceive that, in general, they are one
fourth part higher than the mountains of Eu|rope,
and that almo&s;t the whole of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> have been
and actually are volcano's. But even the highe&s;t
mountains in the interior parts of Europe, A&s;ia,
and Africa, have been extingui&s;hed long beyond
the record of hi&s;tory. It is true, that, in &s;everal
of the&s;e la&s;t mountains, we evidently recogni&s;e
the ancient exi&s;tence of volcano's, as well by
the black and burnt &s;ides of precipices, as by
the nature of the matters which &s;urround them,
<PB N="52" REF="59">
and which extend along the ridges of the moun|tains.
But, as the&s;e mountains are &s;ituated in the

from the &s;ea, the action of the &s;ubterrane|ous
fires, which cannot produce great effects but
by the &s;hock of water, cea&s;ed after the &s;eas re|tired.
It is for this rea&s;on, that, in the Corde|liers,
who&s;e roots may be &s;aid to border upon the
South Sea, mo&s;t of the peaks are actual volcano's;
whil&s;t the volcano's of Auvergne, Vivarais,
Languedoc, Germany, Switzerland, &amp;c. in Eu|rope,
and tho&s;e of Mount Ararat in A&s;ia, and of
Mount Atlas in Africa, have long been ab&s;o|lutely

<P>The height at which vapours freeze is about
2400 fathoms in the Torrid Zone, and about
1500 in France. The tops of high mountains

Mount Aetna, the Norwegian Mountains, the

<HEAD>Of the Direction of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>In vol. I. p. 240. I remarked, that <HI>the direction

&s;outh, and that tho&s;e of the Old Continent run
from we&s;t to ea&s;t.</HI> This la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion requires to
be modified; for though, at fir&s;t &s;ight, we may
follow the mountains as far as China, by pa&s;&s;ing
from the Pyrennees in Auvergne, to the Alps in
Germany, and in Macedonia, to Cauca&s;us and
other mountains of A&s;ia, as far as the Tartarian
&s;ea; and though Mount Atlas, in the &s;ame man|ner,
appears to traver&s;e the Continent of Africa
from we&s;t to ea&s;t, the middle of this va&s;t penin|&s;ula
may &s;till con&s;i&s;t of a chain of high moun|tains
&s;tretching from Mount Atlas to the Moun|tains
of the Moon, and from the&s;e to the Cape
of Good Hope: In this view, the middle of the
Continent of Africa may be con&s;idered as con|&s;i&s;ting
of mountains which run from north to
&s;outh through its whole extent, like the moun|tains
<PB N="56" REF="63">
of America. Tho&s;e parts of Mount At|las
which traver&s;e Africa from we&s;t to ea&s;t,
&s;hould be con&s;idered as branches only of the
principal chain. The mountains of the Moon,
which run from we&s;t to ea&s;t, may likewi&s;e be
regarded as collateral branches; and, if there are
no volcano's in this prodigious range of moun|tains,
it may be owing to the va&s;t di&s;tance of
the &s;ea from the middle regions of Africa;
whil&s;t, in America, the &s;ea is very near the foot
of the high mountains, which, in&s;tead of occu|pying
the middle of the penin&s;ula of South
America, are all &s;ituated to the we&s;t; and the
exten&s;ive low lands are entirely on the ea&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>The great chain of the Cordeliers are not
the only mountains of America which run from
north to &s;outh. In the territory of Guiana, a|bout
one hundred and fifty leagues from Cay|enne,
there is a chain of pretty high moun|tains,
which al&s;o extends from north to &s;outh.
On the Cayenne &s;ide, this chain is &s;o &s;teep, that
the&s;e mountains are almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. This
&s;teepne&s;s &s;eems to indicate, that, on the other
&s;ide, the declivity is gentle, and con&s;i&s;ts of fine
land. The tradition of the country, according|ly,
or rather the te&s;timony of the Spaniards, is,
that, beyond the mountains, there are populous
nations of &s;avages united into regular &s;ocieties.
It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that there is a gold mine in
the&s;e mountains, and a lake in which grains of
<PB N="57" REF="64">
gold are found: But this fact requires confir|mation.</P>
<P>In Europe, the chain of mountains which be|gins
in Spain, and pa&s;&s;es through France, Ger|many,
and Hungary, divides into two great
branches, one of which extends into A&s;ia by
the mountains of Macedonia, Cauca&s;us, &amp;c.
and the other branch &s;tretches from Hungary
into Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia, and extends as far as
the &s;ources of the Wolga and Bori&s;thenes; and,
&s;tretching &s;till farther, it joins another chain in
Siberia, and terminates in the north &s;ea to the
we&s;t of the river Oby. The&s;e chains of moun|tains
ought to be regarded as one continued
ridge, from which &s;everal large rivers derive
their &s;ources: Some of the&s;e rivers, as the Ta|gus,
and the Doura in Spain, the Garonne and
the Loire in France, and the Rhine in Germany,
empty them&s;elves into the ocean; others, as the
Oder, the Vi&s;tula, and the Niemen, fall into
the Baltic &s;ea; others, as the Dwina, fall into
the White &s;ea, and the river Petzora empties
it&s;elf into the Frozen &s;ea. On the ea&s;t &s;ide, this
chain of mountains gives ri&s;e to the Yeucar and
Ebre in Spain, to the Rhone in France, and to
the Po in Italy, which fall into the Mediter|ranean;
to the Danube and Don, which lo&s;e
them&s;elves in the Black Sea; and, la&s;tly, to the
Wolga, which falls into the Ca&s;pian.</P>

And, it is partly by this di&s;po&s;ition of
the primitive mountains, that all the points or

America, of California, of Groenland, of Cape

many more revolutions have happened in the

Every thing concurs in proving, that the greate&s;t

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the formation of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the valleys and dales on the &s;urface of
the globe, as well as all the mountains and hills,
have originated from two cau&s;es, namely, fire
and water. When the earth fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed its
con&s;i&s;tence, a number of inequalities took place
on its &s;urface; &s;wellings and bli&s;ters aro&s;e, as
happens in a block of gla&s;s or of melted metal.
Hence this fir&s;t cau&s;e produced the original and
the highe&s;t mountains, which re&s;t on the inte|rior
rock of the earth as their ba&s;e, and below
which, as every where el&s;e, there mu&s;t have
been va&s;t caverns, which &s;unk in at different
periods. But, without con&s;idering this &s;econd
<PB N="61" REF="68">
event, the falling in of the caverns, it is cer|tain,
that, when the earth fir&s;t con&s;olidated, it
was every where furrowed with depths and e|minences,
which were produced &s;olely by the
action of cooling&punc; Afterwards, when the wa|ters
were precipitated from the atmo&s;phere,
which happened when the earth cooled &s;o much
as to be unable to repel the vapours, the&s;e wa|ters
covered the whole &s;urface of the globe to
the height of two thou&s;and fathoms; and, du|ring
their long abode upon our continents, the
motion of the tides and that of the currents,
changed the di&s;po&s;ition of the primitive moun|tains
and valleys. The&s;e movements would
form hills in the valleys, and would cover the
bottoms and knaps of the mountains with new
beds of earth; and the currents would produce
furrows or valleys with corre&s;ponding angles.
It is to the&s;e two cau&s;es, of which the one is
much more ancient than the other, that the pre|&s;ent
external form of the &s;urface of the earth is
to be referred. Afterwards, when the &s;eas &s;unk
down, they produced tho&s;e &s;teep precipices on
the we&s;t, where they ran with the greate&s;t ra|pidity,
and left gentle declivities on the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of tho&s;e eminences which were
formed by the &s;ediments of the ocean, is very
different from that of tho&s;e which owe their o|rigin
to the primitive fire. The fir&s;t are di&s;|po&s;ed
in horizontal beds, and contain an infi|nite
<PB N="62" REF="69">
number of marine productions. The &s;e|cond,
on the contrary, are le&s;s regular in their
&s;tructure, and include no marks of &s;ea-bodies.
The&s;e mountains of the fir&s;t and &s;econd forma|tion,
have nothing in common but the perpendi|cular
fi&s;&s;ures; but the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures are effected by
two different cau&s;es. The vitre&s;cent matters, in
cooling, dimini&s;hed in &s;ize, and, of cour&s;e, they
&s;plit, and receded to different di&s;tances. But
tho&s;e compo&s;ed of calcarious matters tran&s;ported
by the waters, &s;plit into fi&s;&s;ures &s;olely by dry|ing.</P>
<P>I have often remarked, that, in detached hills,
the fir&s;t effect of the rains is gradually to carry
down from the &s;ummit the earth and other bo|dies,
which form at the foot a pretty thick &s;tra|tum
of good &s;oil, while the top is left entirely
bare. This effect is, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be,
produced by the rains. But a previous cau&s;e
di&s;po&s;ed the&s;e and &s;imilar matters round all hills,
not excepting tho&s;e which are detached; for,
on one &s;ide, the earth is uniformly better than
on the other: The hills are always &s;teep and
precipitant on one &s;ide, and have a gentle de|clivity
on the other; which proves clearly that
the action, as well as the direction of the mo|tion
of the waters, were greater on one &s;ide
than on the other.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Den&s;ity which certain matters acquire by

in free-&s;tone con&s;i&s;ted of metallic matter, which
appeared to have been melted by a &s;trong fire.</HI>
This a&s;&s;ertion &s;eems to in&s;inuate that the great
ma&s;&s;es of free-&s;tone have originated from the
action of the primitive fire. I at fir&s;t imagined
that this matter owed its den&s;ity and the ad|he&s;ion
of its particles &s;olely to the interven|tion
of water. But I have &s;ince learned that
the action of fire produces the &s;ame effect; and
I &s;hall relate &s;ome experiments which at fir&s;t
&s;urpri&s;ed me, but which I have repeated &s;o of|ten
as to remove every doubt upon this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="experiments">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>I pounded free-&s;tones of different degrees of
hardne&s;s, till they were reduced to a powder
more or le&s;s fine. The&s;e powders I employed
to cover the cements I u&s;ed in converting iron
into &s;teel. This powder of free-&s;tone was &s;trew|ed
over the cement, and heaped up, in the
<PB N="64" REF="71">
form of a dome of three or four inches in thick|ne&s;s,
on an earthen ve&s;&s;el of three feet long by
two broad. After undergoing the action of the
fire in my bla&s;t furnaces, during &s;everal days
and nights without interruption, it was no long|er
the powder of free-&s;tone, but a ma&s;s &s;o &s;olid
that we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">liged to break it in order to un|cover
the ve&s;&s;el which contained the iron, now
converted into &s;teel. The action of fire upon
this powder of free-&s;tone produced ma&s;&s;es e|qually
&s;olid as free-&s;tone of a middling quality,
which does not ring under the hammer. This
fact &s;howed that fire, as well as water, could
prove a cement to vitrifiable &s;and, and, con&s;e|quently,
might have formed tho&s;e immen&s;e
ma&s;&s;es of free-&s;tone which compo&s;e the nucleus
of &s;ome of our mountains.</P>
<P>I am, therefore, fully per&s;uaded, that all the
vitre&s;cent matters, of which the interior rock of
the globe, as well as the nuclei of great moun|tains,
are compo&s;ed, have been produced by
the action of the primitive fire; and that the
waters have only formed tho&s;e acce&s;&s;ory &s;trata
which &s;urround the&s;e nuclei, which are all pa|rallel
and horizontal, or equally inclined, and
in which we find the relicks of &s;hells and other
productions of the ocean.</P>
<P>In the formation of free-&s;tone and other vi|tre&s;cent
matters, I pretend not to exclude the
intervention of water. On the contrary, I am
<PB N="65" REF="72">
inclined to believe, that vitrifiable &s;and may ac|quire
con&s;i&s;tence, and unite into ma&s;&s;es more or
le&s;s hard, perhaps more ea&s;ily by means of wa|ter
than by the action of fire. I have related
the above facts &s;olely with the view of prevent|ing
objections which would not fail to be made,
if it had been thought that I attributed the &s;oli|dity
of free-&s;tones, and other bodies compo&s;ed
of vitrifiable &s;and, to the intervention of water
alone. It is certain, that all the free-&s;tone found
on the &s;urface, or at incon&s;iderable depths, have
been formed by water; for, on the &s;urface of
the&s;e ma&s;&s;es of free-&s;tone, we perceive marks of
undulations and rollings, and &s;ometimes the im|pre&s;&s;ions
of plants and &s;hells. But the free-&s;tones
formed by the &s;ediments of water are ea|&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e which have been
produced by fire. The latter have a coar&s;er
grain, and crumble down more ea&s;ily than free-&s;tone
cemented by the intervention of water,
which is more compact, and harder than that
who&s;e particles have been united by the action
of fire.</P>
<P>Ferruginous matters a&s;&s;ume a great degree of
hardne&s;s by fire; for nothing is harder than ca&s;t
iron. But ferruginous bodies may likewi&s;e ac|quire
con&s;iderable den&s;ity by the intervention of
water. Of this fact I was a&s;certained by put|ting
a quantity of filings of iron into ve&s;&s;els ex|po&s;ed
to the rain. The&s;e filings formed a ma&s;s
<PB N="66" REF="73">
&s;o hard, that it could only be broken by the
hammer.</P>
<P>The vitreous rock which compo&s;es the inte|rior
ma&s;s of the globe, is harder than common
gla&s;s. But it is not harder than certain volcanic
lavas, and much &s;ofter than ca&s;t iron, which,
however, is only gla&s;s mixed with ferruginous
particles. This great hardne&s;s of the interior
rock &s;hows that it con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t fixed par|ticles
of matter, and that, from the time of their
con&s;olidation, they a&s;&s;umed the con&s;i&s;tence and
hardne&s;s which they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s. Hence it can|not
be objected to my hypothe&s;is of general vi|trification,
that bodies reduced to gla&s;s by our
furnaces are le&s;s hard than the rock of the globe;
&s;ince ca&s;t iron, &s;ome lavas, or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;alts, and even
certain porcelains, are harder than this rock,
and yet they derive their hardne&s;s from the ac|tion
of fire alone. Be&s;ides, the elements of
iron and other minerals which give hardne&s;s to
matters liquified by fire, or attenuated by water,
exi&s;ted, as well as the fixed earth, from the
time that the globe was fir&s;t con&s;olidated: And
I have already remarked, that the interior rock
ought not to be regarded as pure gla&s;s, &s;imilar
to that we make with &s;and and &s;alts, but as a
vitreous product mixed with matters the mo&s;t
fixed, and mo&s;t capable of &s;upporting the great
and long continued action of the primitive fire,
the great effects of which can only be compared
<PB N="67" REF="74">
in a very di&s;tant manner with the incon&s;ide|rable
operations of our furnaces; and yet, from
this compari&s;on, though unfavourable, we clear|ly
perceive what effects are common to the pri|mitive
fire and to our furnaces; and it &s;hows, at
the &s;ame time, that the degree of hardne&s;s de|pends
le&s;s on the degree of heat than on the
combination of matters &s;ubmitted to its action.</P>

<HEAD>Of the inclination of the Strata in the Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>I remarked, in Vol. I. p. 15. that, <HI>in plains, the
&s;trata are exactly horizontal. It is in the moun|tains
only that they are inclined to the horizon;
becau&s;e they have originally been formed by &s;edi|ments

<P>The beds of calcarious matters are not only
horizontal in the plains, but likewi&s;e in all
mountains which have not been di&s;turbed by
earthquakes or other accidental cau&s;es: And,
when the &s;trata are inclined, the whole moun|tain
is likewi&s;e inclined, and has been forced in|to
that po&s;ition by a &s;ubterraneous explo&s;ion,
or by the &s;inking of a part of the earth, which
had &s;erved it as a ba&s;is. We may therefore
conclude, in general, that all &s;trata formed by
the &s;ediments of water are horizontal, like the

water it&s;elf, except tho&s;e which have been form|ed
on an inclined ba&s;e, as is the ca&s;e with the
mo&s;t part of coal-mines.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t external part of the earth, whether

At &s;ome di&s;tance from the la&s;t branch of the Nile, there is a mountain compo&s;ed of gra|nite, of prophyry, and of ja&s;per, which extends more than twenty leagues in length, by perhaps an equal number in breadth.

The vegetable &s;tratum is commonly much thick|er

form of &s;ediments by the motion of the waters.
The&s;e, in general, are horizontal; and it is only
by the action of particular cau&s;es that they &s;ome|times
appear inclined. The beds of calcarious
&s;tones are commonly horizontal, or &s;lightly in|clined;
and, of all calcarious &s;ub&s;tances, the
beds of chalk pre&s;erve their horizontal po&s;ition
mo&s;t exactly. As chalk is only the du&s;t of de|cayed
calcarious bodies, it has been depo&s;ited
by waters who&s;e movements were tranquil, and
their o&s;cillations regular; whil&s;t the matters
which were only broken into large ma&s;&s;es, have
been tran&s;ported by currents, and depo&s;ited by
the removal of the waters; which is the rea&s;on
why their &s;trata are not &s;o perfectly horizontal
as tho&s;e of chalk. The high coa&s;ts of Norman|dy
are compo&s;ed of horizontal &s;trata of chalk &s;o
regularly perpendicular, that, at a di&s;tance, they
have the appearance of fortified walls. Be|tween

<HEAD>Of the Peaks of Mountains.</HEAD>
<P>I endeavoured to explain, Vol. I. p. 247. how
the peaks of mountains had been deprived of the
vitrifiable &s;ands with which they had been ori|ginally
inve&s;ted; and my explanation errs in
this circum&s;tance only, that I attributed the fir&s;t
formation of the rocks which form the nuclei
of the&s;e peaks to the intervention of water, in|&s;tead
of a&s;cribing it to the action of fire. The&s;e
peaks or horns of mountains are nothing but
prolongations of the interior rock of the globe,
which were environed with great quantities of
&s;coriae and du&s;t of gla&s;s. The&s;e loo&s;e materials
mu&s;t have been carried down by the movement
of the &s;ea, when it made its retreat. After|wards,
the rains and torrents of water would
&s;oon deprive the ma&s;&s;es of pure rock of all their
coverings, and make them completely bare,
as they are at pre&s;ent. I may remark, in gene|ral,
that no other change falls to be made in my
theory of the earth than the following fact,
<PB N="71" REF="78">
that the fir&s;t mountains derived their origin from
the primitive fire, and not from the intervention
of water, as I had conjectured; becau&s;e I had
then been induced to believe, by the authority
of Woodward and &s;ome other naturali&s;ts, that
&s;hells were found on the tops of all mountains.
But, from more recent ob&s;ervations, it appears,
that there are no &s;hells on the highe&s;t &s;ummits,
nor above two thou&s;and fathoms above the level
of the &s;ea. Hence the waters have never &s;ur|mounted
tho&s;e high &s;ummits, or at lea&s;t have
remained but a &s;hort time upon them; &s;o that
they have formed only the hills and the calcari|ous

<HEAD>Additional Ob&s;ervations on the Theory of run|ning
Waters.</HEAD>
<P>PAGE 266. Concerning the theory of running
waters, I have to add a new ob&s;ervation
which I made &s;ince I e&s;tabli&s;hed mills, by
which the different celerities of water may be
pretty accurately a&s;certained. The&s;e mills are
compo&s;ed of nine wheels, &s;ome of which are
impelled by a fall of water of two or three feet,
and others by a fall of five or &s;ix feet high: I
was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that all the
wheels turned more quickly in the night than
in the day, and that the difference was great|er
in proportion to the height and breadth
of the column of water. For example, if the
water falls &s;ix feet, the wheel will turn a
tenth, and &s;ometimes a ninth quicker in the
night than in the day; and, if the fall is le&s;s
high, the difference of celerity will likewi&s;e be
le&s;s; but it is always &s;o &s;en&s;ible as to be ea&s;ily
<PB N="73" REF="80">
recogni&s;ed. I a&s;certained this fact by placing
white marks upon the wheels, and reckoning
the number of revolutions in equal times, both
during the day and the night; and I uniformly
found, by a great number of ob&s;ervations, that
the time when the wheels moved with the great|e&s;t
celerity was the colde&s;t hour of the night,
and that they moved &s;lowe&s;t when the heat of
the day was greate&s;t. In the &s;ame manner, I
afterwards found, that the celerity of all the
wheels is greater in winter than in &s;ummer.
The&s;e facts, which have e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation
of philo&s;ophers, are of importance in practice.
The theory of them is extremely &s;imple: This
augmentation of celerity depends &s;olely on the
den&s;ity of the water, which is increa&s;ed by cold
and dimini&s;hed by heat: And, as the &s;ame vo|lume
of water only can pa&s;s by the trough, this
volume, which is den&s;er in winter and during
the night, than in &s;ummer or in the day, acts
with more force on the wheel, and, of cour&s;e,
communicates to it a greater quantity of motion.
Thus, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> there will be le&s;s lo&s;s of
water, if we &s;top the machines during the heat
of the day, and work them during the night. By
ob&s;erving this method in my forges, its influ|ence
in the proce&s;s of making iron amounted to
one twelfth part.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation merits attention: Of two
wheels, the one nearer the canal than the other,
<PB N="74" REF="81">
but perfectly equal in every other re&s;pect, and
both moved by an equal quantity of water, the
wheel neare&s;t the canal moves quicker than the
one more remote, and to which the water can|not
arrive till after it has run over a certain
&s;pace in the particular runner that terminates in
this wheel. It is well known, that the friction
of water on the &s;ides of a canal dimini&s;hes its
celerity. But this circum&s;tance is not &s;ufficient
to account for the con&s;iderable difference in the
motion of the&s;e two wheels. It is owing, in the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, to the water in this canal not being
pre&s;&s;ed laterally, as it is when it enters by the
trough of the canal, and to its &s;triking immediately
the ladles of the wheel. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This inequa|lity
of motion, depending on the di&s;tance of the
wheels from the canal, is likewi&s;e owing to the
water, which pa&s;&s;es through a trough, not being a
column of equal dimen&s;ions with the trough; for
the water, in its pa&s;&s;age, forms an irregular cone,
which is depre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ides in proportion to
the breadth of the volume of water in the canal.
If the ladles of the wheel are very near the trough,
the water acts very near as high as the aperture
of the trough: But, if the wheel is more di&s;tant
from the canal, the water &s;inks in the runner, and
&s;trikes not the ladles of the wheel at the &s;ame
height, nor with equal celerity, as in the fir&s;t
ca&s;e. The union of the&s;e two cau&s;es produces
<PB N="75" REF="82">
that diminution of celerity in wheels which are
di&s;tant from the canal.</P>

<HEAD>Of the &s;altne&s;s of the Sea, p. 275.</HEAD>
<P>ON this &s;ubject there are two opinions, and
both of them are partly true. Halley attributes
the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea &s;olely to the &s;alts of the
earth carried down by the rivers; and even &s;up|po&s;es
that the antiquity of the world may be di&s;|covered
by the degree of &s;altne&s;s in the waters
of the ocean. Leibnitz, on the contrary, be|lieves,
that the globe having been liquified by
fire, the &s;als and other empyreumatic &s;ub|&s;tances
produced with the aqueous vapours a &s;alt
lixivium, and, con&s;equently, that the &s;ea received
its &s;altne&s;s from the beginning. The opinions
of the&s;e two great philo&s;ophers, though oppo&s;ite,
&s;hould be united, and may even coincide with my
own. It is extremely probable, that, at the begin|ning,
the action of fire combined with that of wa|ter
di&s;&s;olved all the &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances on the &s;urface
of the earth; and, of cour&s;e, that the fir&s;t de|gree
of &s;altne&s;s in the &s;ea proceeded from the
cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned by Leibnitz; but this prevents not
the &s;econd cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned by Halley from having
<PB N="76" REF="83">
con&s;iderable influence upon the actual degree of
&s;altne&s;s in the &s;ea, which mu&s;t always augment,
becau&s;e the rivers ince&s;&s;antly carry down great
quantities of fixed &s;alts, which cannot be ab|&s;tracted
by evaporation. They remain, therefore,
mixed with the general ma&s;s of waters, which
are, in general, more &s;alt in proportion to their
di&s;tance from the mouths of rivers, and where
the heat of the climate produces the greate&s;t e|vaporation.
That the &s;econd cau&s;e acts more
powerfully than perhaps the fir&s;t, is proved by
this circum&s;tance, that all lakes from which rivers
i&s;&s;ue are not &s;alt, but almo&s;t all tho&s;e which re|ceive
rivers and di&s;charge none, are impregnated
with &s;alt. The Ca&s;pian Sea, Lake Aral, the Dead
Sea, &amp;c. owe their &s;altne&s;s &s;olely to the &s;alts
tran&s;ported thither by the rivers, and which can|not
be carried off by evaporation.</P>

<HEAD>Of perpendicular Cataracts.</HEAD>

feet. I have &s;ince been informed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Fre&s;noye.</NOTE>, that there
is a cataract in Europe, which falls from a

village on the road from Rome to Bologna. It
is formed by the river Velino, which derives
its &s;ource from the mountains of Abbruzzo. Af|ter

<HEAD>Of the Limits of the South Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THE South Sea is much broader than the
Atlantic, and appears to be bounded by
two chains of mountains, which corre&s;pond as
far as the Equator. The fir&s;t chain is compo&s;ed
of the mountains of California, of New Mexi|co,
of the I&s;thmus of Panama, of the Cordeliers,
of Peru, of Chili, &amp;c. The other chain &s;tretches
through Kamt&s;chatka, Ye&s;&s;o, and Japan, and
extends as far as the Larron i&s;lands, and even the
New Philippines. The direction of the&s;e chains
of mountains, which appear to be the ancient
limits of the Pacific Ocean, is preci&s;ely from
north to &s;outh; &s;o that the Old Continent was
bounded on the ea&s;t by one of the&s;e chains
of mountains, and the New Continent by the
other. Their &s;eparation happened at the period
when the waters, proceeding from the &s;outh
pole, began to run between the&s;e two chains

of mountains, which &s;eem to unite, or at lea&s;t
to make a very near approach to each other to|wards
the northern regions. This is not the on|ly
indication of the ancient union of the two
continents on the north. This continuity of
the two continents between Kamt&s;chatka and the
mo&s;t we&s;tern land of America, &s;eems now to
be proved by the new di&s;coveries of navigators,
who have found, under the &s;ame parallel of lati|tude,

<HEAD>Of double Currents in &s;ome parts of the Ocean,

<P>I HAD too generally and two po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert|ed,
that, in no part of the &s;ea, a &s;uperior and in|ferior
current are to be found.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince received information, which &s;eems

even be demon&s;trated, in certain parts of the
&s;ea. On this &s;ubject, M. De&s;landes, an able na|vigator,
obligingly communicated to me the
following accurate remarks, in two letters, the
<PB N="80" REF="87">
one dated December 6. 1770, and the other No|vember

<P>'In your <HI>Theory of the Earth,</HI> Art. XI. <HI>Of

have been deceived by the regorging of the
water near the &s;hores, which often produces a
motion oppo&s;ite to that of the principal current.</HI>'</P>
<P>'After reading this pa&s;&s;age, I determined to
tran&s;mit you my ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject.'</P>
<P>'Two months after my departure from
France, I reconnoitered the land between
Capes Gon&s;alvas and Saint Catharine. The
force of the currents, the direction of which is
to the north north-we&s;t, corre&s;ponding exactly
with the &s;ituation of the lands, obliged me to
ca&s;t anchor. The general winds of this region
blow from the &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t, &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t,
and &s;outh-we&s;t. I &s;pent two months
and a half in making fruitle&s;s attempts to
change my &s;ituation, and to reach the coa&s;t of
Loango, where I had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act.
During this time, I remarked, that the &s;ea de|&s;cended
in the above direction from half a
league to a league in the hour, and that, at
certain depths, the currents a&s;cended below
with the &s;ame rapidity as they de&s;cended a|bove.'</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="88">
'I a&s;certained the depth of the&s;e oppo&s;ite cur|rents
in the following manner. Being moor|ed
in eight fathoms water, and the &s;ea ex|tremely
clear, I fixed a lead of thirty pounds
weight to the end of a line. At about two fa|thoms
from the lead, I tied a table napkin to
the line by one of its corners, and allowed the
lead to &s;ink in the water. As &s;oon as the table
napkin entered, it took the direction of the
fir&s;t current. Continuing to ob&s;erve it, I made
it de&s;cend. Whenever I perceived that the
current di&s;continued, I &s;topped. It then float|ed
indifferently around the line. In this place,
therefore, the run was interrupted. I then
&s;unk the table napkin about a foot lower,
and it a&s;&s;umed an oppo&s;ite direction. By
marking the line at the &s;urface of the water,
I found that the table napkin was at the depth
of three fathoms; from which I concluded, af|ter
different examinations, that, of eight fa|thoms
water, three ran north north-we&s;t, and
five ran in the contrary direction of &s;outh
&s;outh-ea&s;t.'</P>
<P>'The &s;ame day, I repeated the experiment
in fifty fathoms water, being then di&s;tant from
the land &s;ix or &s;even leagues. I was &s;urpri&s;ed
to find that the upper current was deeper in
proportion to the depth of the bottom. Of
fifty fathoms water, I reckoned that from
twelve to fifteen ran in the fir&s;t direction. This
<PB N="82" REF="89">
phaenomenon did not take place during the
whole two months and a half that I remained
on this coa&s;t, but nearly one month only, and
at different times; during the&s;e interruptions
the whole water ran into the gulf of Guiney.'</P>
<P>'This oppo&s;ition of currents &s;ugge&s;ted the
idea of a machine, which, being &s;unk as
far as the inferior current, and pre&s;enting a
great &s;urface, might force my ve&s;&s;el again&s;t
the &s;uperior current, I made the experiment
in miniature upon a boat; and I proceed|ed
&s;o far as to produce an equilibrium be|tween
the force of the &s;uperior current, join|ed
to that of the wind, upon the boat, and
the force of the inferior current upon the ma|chine.
I had not an opportunity of making
trials on a larger &s;cale. What I have related,
Sir, is a truth which may be confirmed by e|very
navigator who has vi&s;ited the&s;e climates.'</P>
<P>'I imagine that the winds, as well as the ri|vers,
which di&s;charge them&s;elves into the &s;ea
along this coa&s;t, and carry great quantities of
earth into the gulf of Guiney, are the princi|pal
cau&s;es of the&s;e effects. Be&s;ides, the bottom
of this gulf, which, by its declivity, obliges the
tide to run retrograde whenever it arrives at a
certain level, and is ince&s;&s;antly pre&s;&s;ed by fre&s;h
quanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, while the wind acts in a contrary
direction upon the &s;urface, and con&s;trains part
of the water to ob&s;erve its ordinary cour&s;e.
This &s;eems to be the more probable, becau&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="90">
the &s;ea enters from all quarters into this gulf,
and i&s;&s;ues only by revolutions which &s;eldom
happen. The moon has no apparent effect;
for the &s;ame thing takes place during all its
pha&s;es.'</P>
<P>'I had occa&s;ion to be &s;till farther convinced
that the pre&s;&s;ure of the water, when it comes
to its level, joined to the inclination of the bot|tom,
are the &s;ole cau&s;es of this phaenomenon.
I found, that the&s;e currents exi&s;t only in pro|portion
to the &s;maller or greater declivity of
the &s;hores; and I have every rea&s;on to believe,
that they are not perceived beyond twelve or
fifteen leagues from land, which is the great|e&s;t
di&s;tance along the coa&s;t of Angola, where
we can be certain of finding the bottom. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The following circum&s;tances &s;eem to prove,
that &s;imilar changes in the currents take place
in the open &s;ea. I made one of my experi|ments
at a mean depth, namely thirty-five fa|thoms.
I found, at the depth of &s;ix or &s;even
fathoms, that the cour&s;e of the water ran
north north-we&s;t. On &s;inking two or three
fathoms more, my line &s;tretched to the we&s;t
north-we&s;t. At three or four fathoms deeper,
the cour&s;e was we&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t, then &s;outh-we&s;t,
and &s;outh. La&s;tly, at twenty-five and
twenty-&s;ix fathoms, the cour&s;e was &s;outh
&s;outh-ea&s;t, and towards the bottom it was
&s;outh-ea&s;t and ea&s;t &s;outh-ea&s;t. From the&s;e
experiments I drew the following conclu&s;ions:
<PB N="84" REF="91">
That I might compare the ocean between A|frica
and America to a great river, the cour&s;e
of which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly directed to the
north-we&s;t; that, as it runs along, it carries
down &s;and and mud, which it depo&s;its on its
banks. The&s;e banks are, of cour&s;e, heighten|ed,
and nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e the level of the water,
and oblige it to run ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ograde in proportion
to the declivity of the &s;hore. But, as the wa|ter
is directed by a primitive impul&s;e, it can|not
return in a &s;traight line: Obeying the o|riginal
movement, and yielding reluctantly to
the la&s;t ob&s;tacle, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;cribe a
curve of greater or &s;maller extent, till it meets
the middle current with which it may partly
unite, or which may &s;erve it as a fulcrum, and
give it a direction contrary to that impre&s;&s;ed
on it by the bottom. As the ma&s;s of water is
in perpetual motion, the water towards the
bottom, being nearer the cau&s;e and more pre&s;|&s;ed,
mu&s;t always undergo the fir&s;t changes,
and run in a direction contrary to the &s;uperior
current, while the &s;ame cau&s;e reaches not dif|ferent
heights. The&s;e, Sir, are my ideas.
I have frequently taken advantage of the&s;e in|ferior
currents; by &s;inking a machine to dif|ferent
depths, according to the number of fa|thoms
water I happened to be in, I was en|abled
to &s;ail again&s;t the upper current. I
found, that, in calm water, and with a &s;urface
<PB N="85" REF="92">
three times larger than that part of the prow
which is below the water, we could run from
a third to half a league in the hour. Of this
fact I was a&s;certained by my latitude, by boats
which I anchored, and from which I found
my&s;elf at a great di&s;tance an hour afterward;
and, la&s;tly, by the di&s;tance of certain points a|long
the coa&s;ts.'</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations of M. De&s;landes &s;eem to

they were liable to exceptions. It is
not le&s;s certain, however, that the ocean forced
open the &s;trait of Gibraltar, and, con&s;equently,
that the Mediterranean &s;ea received a great aug|mentation
by this irruption. I re&s;ted this opi|nion
not only on the current of the ocean into
the Mediterranean, but on the &s;ituation of the
land and the corre&s;pondence of the &s;trata on the
oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts, which has often been remarked
by intelligent navigators. 'The irruption which
formed the Mediterranean is evident, as well
as that of the Black Sea by the &s;trait of the
Dardanelles, where the current is always vio|lent,
and the corre&s;pondence of the angles of
the two coa&s;ts &s;trongly marked, as well as the

<P>ON viewing the i&s;lands and gulfs, which are
very numerous round Greenland, it is difficult,
as navigators remark, not to &s;u&s;pect that the
&s;ea falls back from the Poles towards the Equa|tor.
What favours this conjecture, the tide ri|&s;es
eighteen feet at Cape des Etats, and only
eight feet in the bay of Di&s;ko, <HI>i. e.</HI> at ten de|grees
of higher latitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation, joined to that of the pre|ceding
article, &s;eems &s;till farther to confirm the
movement of the waters of the ocean from the
&s;outhern to the northern regions, where they
are forced, by the re&s;i&s;tance of the lands, to re|gorge
or flow back toward the &s;outh.</P>
<P>In Hud&s;on's bay, ve&s;&s;els have to pre&s;erve
them&s;elves from mountains of ice, which are
<PB N="87" REF="94">
&s;aid to be from fifteen to eighteen hundred feet
thick, and which, being formed by a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of long winters, in &s;mall gulfs perpetually
filled with &s;now, have been detached by the
north-we&s;t winds, or by &s;ome other powerful
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The north-we&s;t wind, which prevails perpe|tually
during winter, and often in &s;ummer,
excites, in the &s;ame bay, dreadful tempe&s;ts.
The&s;e are &s;till more to be apprehended, becau&s;e
&s;hoals are here very frequent. In the countries
which bound this bay, the &s;un never ri&s;es nor
&s;ets without a great cone of light. When this
phaenomenon di&s;appears, it is &s;ucceeded by the
aurora borealis. Here the heavens are &s;eldom
&s;erene. In &s;pring and autumn the air is gene|rally
replete with thick fogs; and, during win|ter,
with an infinity of &s;mall threads of ice,
which are vi&s;ible to the eye. Though the &s;um|mer
heats are con&s;iderable during two months

<P>Some ob&s;ervations have lately been made up|on the
temperature of the land and water in
the climates adjacent to the north Pole.</P>
<P>'In Greenland, the cold begins with the new
year, and becomes &s;o piercing in the months
of February and March, that the &s;tones &s;plit,
and the &s;ea &s;mokes like a furnace, e&s;pecially in
the bays. In the mid&s;t of this thick fog,
however, the fro&s;t is not &s;o inten&s;e, as when
the &s;ky is unclouded; for, when we pa&s;s from
the land to that foggy atmo&s;phere which co|vers
the &s;urface and margins of the waters,
we feel a milder air, though our hair and
clothes are &s;tiffened with hoar-fro&s;t. This fog
produces more chilblains than a dry cold; and,
when it pa&s;&s;es from the &s;ea to a colder atmo&s;|phere,
it in&s;tantly freezes, is di&s;per&s;ed through
the horizon by the wind, and produces a cold
&s;o inten&s;e that no per&s;on can go into the open
air, without running the hazard of having his
hands and feet entirely frozen. It is in this
&s;ea&s;on, that we &s;ee the water freeze on the fire
before it boils. It is then that the winter
paves a road of ice between i&s;lands, and in the
bays and &s;traits.'</P>
<P>'Autumn is the fine&s;t &s;ea&s;on in Greenland.
<PB N="89" REF="96">
But its duration is &s;hort, and frequently inter|rupted
by cold fro&s;ty nights. It is al&s;o about
this time, that, in an atmo&s;phere darkened
with vapours, we &s;ee fogs which freeze and
form a ti&s;&s;ue on the &s;ea &s;imilar to cobwebs;
and, in the fields, the air is impregnated with lu|cid
atoms, or &s;harp icicles like &s;mall needles.'</P>
<P>'It has often been remarked, that the &s;ea&s;ons
in Greenland a&s;&s;ume a temperature oppo&s;ite to
that which prevails in the re&s;t of Europe.
When the winter is rigorous in the temperate
climates, it is mild in Greenland, and very
&s;evere in this northern region, when it is mo|derate
in our countries. At the end of the
year 1739, he winter was &s;o mild in the bay
of Di&s;ko, that the guee&s;e, in the month of Ja|nuary,
pa&s;&s;ed from the temperate to the fro|zen
zone in que&s;t of warmer air; and that, in
1740, no ice was &s;een at Di&s;ko in the month
of March; while, in Europe, the ice prevail|ed,
without interruption, from October to
May. . . . .'</P>
<P>'In winter 1763, which was extremely cold
over all Europe, the cold was &s;o little felt in
Greenland, that &s;ome &s;ummers have been le&s;s
mild<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 20. &amp;c.</NOTE>.''</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ured by voyagers, that, in the &s;eas
adjacent to Greenland, there are very high moun|tains
of floating ice, and others which re&s;emble
<PB N="90" REF="97">
rafts of two hundred fathoms in length, by &s;ix|ty
or eighty in breadth. But the&s;e boards of ice,
which form immen&s;e plains upon the &s;ea, are
&s;eldom above nine or twelve feet thick. They
&s;eem to be formed immediately on the &s;urface
when the cold is greate&s;t. But the floating and
very high ma&s;&s;es come from the land, <HI>i. e.</HI> from
the environs of mountains and coa&s;ts, from
which they have been detached and carried
down to the &s;ea by the rivers. The&s;e ma&s;&s;es of
ice bring along with them great quantities of
wood, which are afterwards thrown by the &s;ea
upon the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of Greenland. This
wood, it appears, neither comes from Labrador
nor Norway; becau&s;e the north-ea&s;t winds,
which are very violent in the&s;e countries, would
pu&s;h back the trees, and the currents which run
to the &s;outh of Davis's &s;trait, and Hud&s;on's bay,
would &s;top all that might come from America
to the coa&s;ts of Greenland.</P>
<P>The &s;ea begins to carry boards of ice to Spitz|bergen
in the months of April and May. A
great number come from Davis's &s;trait, part of
them from Nova Zembla, and the greate&s;t num|ber
from the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Greenland, being
tran&s;ported from ea&s;t to we&s;t according to the
general movement of the ocean.</P>
<P>The following facts and notices are to be
found in the voyage of Captain Phipps. 'The
idea of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies by the
<PB N="91" REF="98">
North Pole was &s;ugge&s;ted as early as the year
1527, by Robert Thorne, merchant of Bri&s;|tol. . . . .'
No voyage, however, appears to
have been undertaken to explore the circumpo|lar
&s;eas, till the year 1607, when 'Henry Hud|&s;on
was &s;et forth, at the charge of certain wor|&s;hipful
merchants of London, to di&s;cover a pa&s;|&s;age
by the North Pole to Japan and China.

between &s;eventy-eight degrees and a half, and
eighty-two degrees, by this way there is no
pa&s;&s;age.'</P>

this pa&s;&s;age, but without &s;ucce&s;s.'</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99">
On the fifth of July, Captain Phipps &s;aw great
quantities of floating ice about the 79&deg; 34&prime; of la|titude.
The weather was foggy. The next
day he continued his cour&s;e as far as the 79&deg; 59&prime;
39&Prime; between Spitzbergen and the ice. On the
7th, he proceeded through the floating ma&s;&s;es of
ice in que&s;t of an open pa&s;&s;age to the north
by which he might gain an open &s;ea. But the ice
to the north-north-we&s;t formed one continued
ma&s;s; and at 80&deg; 36&prime; the &s;ea was entirely frozen;
&s;o that all the attempts of Captain Phipps to
di&s;cover a pa&s;&s;age proved abortive.' 'On the
12th of September, Dr Irvine tried the tem|perature
of the &s;ea in a &s;tate of great agitation,
and found it con&s;iderably warmer than that of
the atmo&s;phere. This ob&s;ervation is the more
intere&s;ting, as it agrees with a pa&s;&s;age in Plu|tarch's
Natural Que&s;tions, not (I believe) before
taken notice of, or confirmed by experiment,
in which he remarks,' 'that the &s;ea becomes
warmer by being agitated in waves. . . . The&s;e
gales are as common in the &s;pring as in the au|tumn;
there is every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, there|fore,
that at an early &s;ea&s;on we &s;hould have met
with the &s;ame bad weather in going out as we
did on our return.' And, as Captain Phipps de|parted
from England in the end of May, he
certainly took the &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t favourable to his
expedition. . . . 'There was al&s;o mo&s;t probabili|ty,
if ever navigation &s;hould be practicable to the
<PB N="93" REF="100">
Pole, of finding the &s;ea open to the northward
after the &s;ol&s;tice; the &s;un having then exerted
the full influence of his rays, though there was
enough of the &s;ummer &s;till remaining for the
purpo&s;e of exploring the &s;eas to the northward
and we&s;tward of Spitzbergen.'</P>
<P>I agree entirely with this able navigator; and
I &s;u&s;pect that the expedition to the Pole cannot
be renewed with &s;ucce&s;s, and that we can never
reach beyond the 82d or 83<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> degree. We are
a&s;&s;ured that a ve&s;&s;el from Whitby, in the year
1774, penetrated as far as the 80th degree, with|out
&s;eeing ice &s;ufficient to prevent &s;ailing &s;till
farther. A Captain Robin&s;on is likewi&s;e quo|ted,
from who&s;e journal it appears that, in
1773, he arrived at the 81&deg; 30&prime;. La&s;tly, a
Dutch &s;hip of war, &s;ent to protect the whale|fi&s;hers,
is &s;aid to have advanced, about fifty
years ago, as far as the 88th degree. Dr Camp|bell,
it is added, received this intelligence from
a Dr <HI>Daillie,</HI> who was in the ve&s;&s;el, and prac|ti&s;ed
phy&s;ic in London in the year 1745<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gazette de Literature, Ao&ucirc;t 9. 1774, No. 61.</NOTE>. This
is probably the &s;ame navigator whom I formerly
quoted under the name of Captain Mouton.
But I am extremely &s;u&s;picious of the fact; and
I am per&s;uaded, that we &s;hall in vain at|tempt
to reach beyond the 82d or 83d degree,
and that, if a pa&s;&s;age by the north is practicable,
it can only be by the way of Hud&s;on's bay.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="101">
On this &s;ubject, the following pa&s;&s;age of the
learned and ingenious author of the hi&s;tory of
the Two Indies merits attention, 'Hud&s;on's bay
always has been, and is &s;till looked upon as the
neare&s;t road from Europe to the Ea&s;t Indies,
and to the riche&s;t parts of A&s;ia.'</P>
<P>'Cabot was the fir&s;t who entertained an idea
of a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the South-&s;eas; but
his di&s;coveries ended at Newfoundland. After
him followed a crowd of Engli&s;h navigators,
many of whom had the honour of giving their
names to &s;avage coa&s;ts which no mortal had e|ver
vi&s;ited before. The&s;e bold and memora|ble
expeditions were more &s;triking than really
u&s;eful. The mo&s;t fortunate of them did not
furni&s;h a &s;ingle idea relative to the object of
pur&s;uit. The Dutch, le&s;s frequent in their at|tempts,
and who pur&s;ued them with le&s;s ar|dour,
were of cour&s;e not more &s;ucce&s;sful, and
the whole began to be treated as a chimera,
when the di&s;covery of Hud&s;on's bay rekindled
all the hopes that were nearly extingui&s;hed.'</P>
<P>'From this time the attempts were renewed
with fre&s;h ardour. Tho&s;e that had been made
before in vain by the mother-country, who&s;e
attention was engro&s;&s;ed by her own inte&s;tine
commotions, were pur&s;ued by New England,
who&s;e &s;ituation was favourable to the enter|pri&s;e.
Still, however, for &s;ome time there
were more voyages undertaken than di&s;cove|ries
<PB N="95" REF="102">
made. The nation was a long time kept
in &s;u&s;pen&s;e by the contradictory accounts recei|ved
from the adventurers. While &s;ome main|tained
the po&s;&s;ibility, &s;ome the probability,
and others a&s;&s;erted the certainty of the pa&s;&s;age;
the accounts they gave, in&s;tead of clearing up
the point, involved it in &s;till greater darkne&s;s.
Indeed, the&s;e accounts are &s;o full of ob&s;curity
and confu&s;ion, they are &s;ilent upon &s;o many
important circum&s;tances, and they di&s;play &s;uch
vi&s;ible marks of ignorance and want of vera|city,
that, however impatient we may be of de|termining
the que&s;tion, it is impo&s;&s;ible to build
any thing like a &s;olid judgment upon te&s;timo|nies
&s;o &s;u&s;picious. At length, the famous
expedition of 1746 threw &s;ome kind of light
upon a point which had remained enveloped in
darkne&s;s for two centuries pa&s;t. But upon
what grounds have the later navigators enter|tained
better hopes? What are the experiments
on which they found their conjectures?'</P>
<P>'Let us proceed to give an account of their
arguments. There are three facts in natural
hi&s;tory, which henceforward mu&s;t be taken
for granted. The fir&s;t is, that the tides come
from the ocean, and that they extend more
or le&s;s into the other &s;eas, in proportion as
their channels communicate with the great
re&s;ervoir by larger or &s;maller openings; from
whence it follows that this periodical motion
<PB N="96" REF="103">
is &s;carcely perceptible in the Mediterranean, in
the Baltic, and other gulfs of the &s;ame nature.
A &s;econd matter of fact is, that the tides are
much later and much weaker in places more
remote from the ocean, than in tho&s;e which
are nearer to it. The third fact is, that vio|lent
winds, which blow in a direction with the
tides, make them ri&s;e above their ordinary
boundaries, and that tho&s;e which blow in a
contrary direction retard their motion, at the
&s;ame time that they dimini&s;h their &s;well.'</P>
<P>'From the&s;e principles, it is mo&s;t certain that,
if Hud&s;on's bay were no more than a gulf in|clo&s;ed
between two continents, and had no
communication but with the Atlantic, the tides
in it would be very incon&s;iderable; they would
be weaker in proportion as they were further
removed from the &s;ource, and would be le&s;s
&s;trong wherever they ran in a contrary direc|tion
to the wind. But it is proved by ob&s;er|vations
made with the greate&s;t &s;kill and preci|&s;ion,
that the tides are very high throughout
the whole bay. It is certain that they are
higher towards the bottom of the bay than e|ven
in the &s;trait it&s;elf, or at lea&s;t in the neigh|bourhood
of it. It is proved that even this
height increa&s;es whenever the wind blows from
a corner oppo&s;ite to the &s;trait; it is, there|fore,
certain, that Hud&s;on's bay has a com|munication
<PB N="97" REF="104">
with the ocean, be&s;ide that which
has been already found out.'</P>
<P>'Tho&s;e who have endeavoured to explain
the&s;e very &s;triking facts, by &s;uppo&s;ing a com|munication
of Hud&s;on's with Baffin's bay, or
with Davis's &s;traits, are evidently mi&s;taken.
They would not &s;cruple to reject this opinion,
for which indeed there is no real foundation,
if they only con&s;idered that the tides are much
lower in Davis's &s;traits, and in Baffin's bay,
than in Hud&s;on's.'</P>
<P>'But if the tides in Hud&s;on's bay can come
neither from the Atlantic ocean, nor from a|ny
other northern &s;ea, in which they are con|&s;tantly
much weaker, it follows that they mu&s;t
have their origin in the South Sea. And this
is &s;till further apparent from another leading
fact, which is, that the highe&s;t tides ever
ob&s;erved upon the&s;e coa&s;ts, are always occa|&s;ioned
by the north-we&s;t winds, which blow
directly again&s;t the mouth of the &s;trait.'</P>
<P>'Having thus determined, as much as the na|ture
of the &s;ubject will permit, the exi&s;tence
of this pa&s;&s;age &s;o long and &s;o vainly wi&s;hed-for,
the next point is to find out in what part of
the bay it is to be expected. From con&s;ider|ing
every circum&s;tance, we are induced to
think that the attempts, which have been hi|therto
made without either choice or method,
ought to be directed towards Welcome bay, on
<PB N="98" REF="105">
the we&s;tern coa&s;t. Fir&s;t, the bottom of the &s;ea
is to be &s;een there at the depth of about eleven
fathom, which is an evident &s;ign that the wa|ter
comes from &s;ome ocean, as &s;uch a tran&s;pa|rency
could not exi&s;t in waters di&s;charged from
rivers, or in melted &s;now or rain. Secondly,
the currents keep this place always free from
ice, while all the re&s;t of the bay is covered
with it; and their violence cannot be account|ed
for but by &s;uppo&s;ing them to come from
&s;ome we&s;tern &s;ea. La&s;tly, the whales, who
towards the latter end of autumn always go in
&s;earch of the warme&s;t climates, are found in
great abundance in the&s;e parts towards the end
of &s;ummer, which would &s;eem to indicate that
there is an outlet for them from thence to the
&s;outh &s;eas, not to the northern ocean.'</P>
<P>'It is probable that the pa&s;&s;age is very &s;hort.
All the rivers that empty them&s;elves on the
we&s;tern coa&s;t of Hud&s;on's bay are &s;mall and
&s;low, which &s;eems to prove that they do not
come from any di&s;tance; and that con&s;equent|ly
the lands which &s;eparate the two &s;eas are of
a &s;mall extent. This argument is &s;trengthened
by the height and regularity of the tides.
Wherever there is no other difference between
the times of the ebb and flow, but that which
is occa&s;ioned by the retarded progre&s;&s;ion of
the moon in her return to the meridian, it is
a certain &s;ign that the ocean from whence
<PB N="99" REF="106">
tho&s;e tides come is very near. If the pa&s;&s;age
is &s;hort, and not very far to the north, as e|very
thing &s;eems to promi&s;e, we may al&s;o pre|&s;ume
that it is not very difficult. The rapidi|ty
of the currents ob&s;ervable in the&s;e latitudes;
which prevents any flakes of ice from continu|ing
there, cannot but give &s;ome weight to this
conjecture.'</P>
<P>I believe, with this excellent writer, that if
a practicable pa&s;&s;age exi&s;ts, it mu&s;t be at the
bottom of Hud&s;on's bay, and that all attempts
by Baffin's bay will be fruitle&s;s, becau&s;e the cli|mate
is too cold, and its coa&s;ts are always fro|zen,
e&s;pecially towards the north. But the ex|i&s;tence
of this pa&s;&s;age is rendered &s;till more
doubtful by the lands di&s;covered, in 1741, by
Bering and Tchirikow, under the &s;ame latitude
with Hud&s;on's bay; for the&s;e lands &s;eem to
form a part of the great Continent of America,
which appears to &s;tretch under the &s;ame lati|tude
as far as the Polar circle. Of cour&s;e, the
pa&s;&s;age into the &s;outh &s;ea can only be found
about the 55th degree of north latitude.</P>

<P>The&s;e facts, which are both accurate and

&s;ea has no &s;ubterraneous communication

&s;ea never formed a part of the ocean; for it
contains neither oy&s;ters nor any other &s;ea|&s;hells,
but &s;uch &s;pecies only as are found in ri|vers.
We are, therefore, warranted to con|clude,
that this &s;ea is nothing but a great lake

<HEAD>Of the Salt Lakes of A&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>IN the country of the U&s;ian Tartars, &s;o cal|led

waters of which were formerly fre&s;h, and are
now &s;alt. He makes the &s;ame remark concern|ing
a lake near Miacs.</P>
<P>One of the lakes mo&s;t famous for the quan|tity
of &s;alt extracted from it, is that near the
banks of the river I&s;el, called <HI>Sorat&s;chya.</HI> The
&s;alt of it, in general, is bitter, and employed by
the phy&s;icians as a good purgative. Two oun|ces
of this &s;alt makes a very &s;trong do&s;e. Near
Kurteneg&s;ch, the &s;hoals are covered with a bit|ter
&s;alt, which ri&s;es, like a field of &s;now, to
the height of two inches. The lake Korjack of

a great quantity.</P>
<P>In the voyages performed under the au&s;pices
of the Academy of Peter&s;burg, mention is made
of the &s;alt lake of Jamu&s;cha in Siberia. This
lake, which is nearly round, is only about nine
leagues in circumference. Its margins are co|vered
<PB N="103" REF="110">
with &s;alt, and the bottom is clothed with
cry&s;tals of &s;alt. The water is extremely &s;alt;
and, when the &s;un &s;hines, it appears reddi&s;h like
the &s;ky in a &s;ine morning. The &s;alt is as white
as &s;now, and forms it&s;elf into cubic cry&s;tals.
The quantity of it is &s;o immen&s;e, that a num|ber
of ve&s;&s;els may, in a &s;hort time, be loaded
with it; and, after it has been removed, it is a|gain
replaced in five or &s;ix days. It is &s;uffi|cient
to remark, that it &s;upplies the provinces
of Tobol&s;ki and Jeni&s;eik, and that this lake
could &s;upply fifty provinces of &s;imilar extent.
The commerce of this, as well as of all other
&s;alt, is re&s;erved in the hands of the crown. This
&s;alt is exceedingly good. It &s;urpa&s;&s;es all others
in whitene&s;s, and none is more proper for cu|ring
meat. In the &s;outh of A&s;ia, there are
likewi&s;e &s;alt lakes, one near the Euphrates, and
another in the neighbourhood of Barra. There
are others, it is &s;aid, near Haleb, and at Larne|ca

upon the &s;ea. The &s;alt valley of Barra, being
at no great di&s;tance from the Euphrates, might
be worked, if its waters were made to run into
this river, and if the earth was good: But at

places, there mu&s;t be two different bottoms,
the one often covering the other at intervals:
The ancient and permanent, which may be
called the general bottom, and the other acci|dental
or particular. The fir&s;t, which ought to
form the ba&s;is of a general picture, is the &s;oil
of the ba&s;in that contains the &s;ea. It is com|po&s;ed
of the &s;ame &s;trata which we every
where find in the bowels of the earth, &s;uch as
marl, &s;tone, clay, &s;and, &s;hells, all di&s;po&s;ed ho|rizontally,
and of an equal thickne&s;s through
a great extent. . . Here, we find a bottom
of marl, there a bottom of clay, &s;and, or rock.
La&s;tly, the number of general bottoms di&s;co|verable
by &s;ounding exceeds not &s;ix or &s;even
&s;pecies. The mo&s;t exten&s;ive and thicke&s;t of
the&s;e &s;trata, being uncovered, or cut perpendi|cularly,
form great &s;paces in the &s;ea, where
we ought to recogni&s;e the general bottom, in|dependent
of &s;uch foreign &s;ub&s;tances as
may be depo&s;ited by currents or other cau&s;es.
There are other permanent bottoms which
we have not hitherto mentioned: The&s;e are
tho&s;e immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of madrepores and
corals, which often cover a bottom of rock,
and tho&s;e enormous and extended banks of
&s;hells, which a rapid multiplication, or other
cau&s;es, have accumulated, and which occur in
different places, as it were in colonies. One
&s;pecies occupies a certain extent; the &s;ucceed|ing

&s;pace is occupied by another &s;pecies, in
the &s;ame manner as has been remarked with

on the interior parts of earth,
and on &s;uch places as the &s;ea leaves uncovered,
where we always &s;ee particular &s;pecies reign|ing

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Currents in the Ocean, Vol. I. p. 365.</HEAD>
<P>TO the enumeration of currents, we &s;hall add
the famous current of Mo&s;ckoe, Mo&s;che, or Male,
on the coa&s;t of Norway, of which a learned
Swede has given the following de&s;cription.</P>
<P>'This current, which took its name from the
rock of Mo&s;chen&s;icle, &s;ituated between the two
i&s;lands of Tofode and Woeroen, extends four
miles from north to &s;outh.'</P>
<P>'It is extremely rapid, e&s;pecially between the
rock of Mo&s;che and the point of Lofoede. But,
in proportion as it approaches the two i&s;les of
Woeroen and Roe&s;t, its rapidity dimini&s;hes.
It fini&s;hes its cour&s;e from north to &s;outh in &s;ix
hours, and from &s;outh to north in an equal
time.'</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="115">
'This current is &s;o rapid, that it produces a
number of &s;mall eddies, which the Norwegians
call <HI>gargamer.</HI>'</P>
<P>'In&s;tead of following the cour&s;e of the tides,
it ob&s;erves an oppo&s;ite direction. When the
waters of the ocean ri&s;e, they proceed from
&s;outh to north, but the current then runs from
north to &s;outh. When the &s;ea retires, it goes
from north to &s;outh, but the current then runs
from &s;outh to north.'</P>
<P>'It is remarkable, that, both in going and re|turning,
it does not de&s;cribe a &s;traight line, like
other currents found in &s;ome &s;traits, where the
waters of the &s;ea ri&s;e and fall; but it moves in
a circular direction.'</P>
<P>'When the waters of the &s;ea have ri&s;en one
half, tho&s;e of the current run to the &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t.
In proportion as the &s;ea ri&s;es, the current
turns towards the &s;outh; from thence it turns
toward the &s;outh-we&s;t, and from the &s;outh-we&s;t
to the we&s;t.'</P>
<P>'When the tide is full, the current goes to|ward
the north-we&s;t, and then toward the
north. About the middle of the reflux, the
current recommences its cour&s;e, after having
been &s;u&s;pended during &s;ome &s;econds.'</P>
<P>'The principal phaenomenon is its return by
the we&s;t from the &s;outh &s;outh-ea&s;t toward the
north. If it did not come back by the &s;ame
road, it would be difficult and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="109" REF="116">
to &s;ail from the point of Lofoede to the two
great i&s;lands of Woeroen and Roue&s;t. There
are two pari&s;hes, which would nece&s;&s;arily be un|inhabited,
if the current ob&s;erved not the cour&s;e
I have de&s;cribed. But, as it actually ob&s;erves
this cour&s;e, tho&s;e who pa&s;s from the point of
Lofoede to the two i&s;lands, wait till the tide
has ri&s;en one half, becau&s;e the direction of the
current is then to the we&s;t. When they want
to return from the&s;e i&s;lands to the point of
Lofoede, they wait till the tide be half ebb;
becau&s;e the cour&s;e of the current is then toward
the Continent. This circum&s;tance renders the
pa&s;&s;age very ea&s;y. . . Now, there is no current
without a declivity; and here the water ri&s;es
on one &s;ide and de&s;cends by the other. . . . . .'</P>
<P>'To be convinced of this truth, we have only
to con&s;ider that there is a &s;mall tongue of land
in Norway which extends &s;ixteen miles into
the &s;ea, from the point of Lofoede, which in|clines
more to the we&s;t, as far as that of Lod|dinge,
which inclines more to the ea&s;t. This
tongue of land is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea; and,
whether during the flux or reflux, the water
is always &s;topt there; becau&s;e it can have no
i&s;&s;ue but through &s;ix &s;mall &s;traits or pa&s;&s;ages
which divide the tongue of land into an equal
number of portions. Some of the&s;e exceed not
half a quarter of a mile in breadth, and &s;ome|times
not half &s;o much. Hence they can con|tain
<PB N="110" REF="117">
only a &s;mall quantity of water. Of cour&s;e,
when the &s;ea ri&s;es, a great part of the water
coming to the north is &s;topt to the &s;outh of
this tongue of land. The waters are, therefore,
much more elevated toward the &s;outh than to|ward
the north. When the &s;ea retires, and
goes toward the &s;outh, a great part of the wa|ter,
in the &s;ame manner, is arre&s;ted to the
north of this tongue of land, and, con&s;equently,
is much higher towards the north than towards
the &s;outh.'</P>
<P>'The waters thus interrupted &s;ometimes, at
the north and &s;ometimes at the &s;outh, can find
an i&s;&s;ue only between the point of Lofoede
and the i&s;land of Woeroen, and between this
i&s;land and that of Roue&s;t.'</P>
<P>'The declivity of the waters, when they de|&s;cend,
produces the rapidity of the current;
and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, this rapidity is greate&s;t
toward the point of Lofoede. As this point is
neare&s;t the place where the waters are &s;topt,
the rapidity there is likewi&s;e greate&s;t; and, in
proportion as the waters of the current extend
toward the i&s;lands of Woeroen and Roue&s;t,
their celerity decrea&s;es.'</P>
<P>'It is now ea&s;y to conceive why the current
is always diametrically oppo&s;ite to the motion
of the &s;ea. Nothing oppo&s;es the common move|ments
of the waters, whether they ri&s;e or fall.
But the waters which are &s;topt above the point
<PB N="111" REF="118">
of Lofoede can neither move in a &s;traight
line, nor beyond this point, while the &s;ea has
not de&s;cended lower, and has not, in retiring,
carried off the waters, which tho&s;e that are
&s;topt above the point of Lofoede ought to re|place. . . . .'</P>
<P>'At the commencement of the flux and reflux,
the waters of the &s;ea cannot turn back tho&s;e of
the current; but, when they have ri&s;en or
fallen one half, they are then enabled to
change the direction of the current. As it can|not
then turn toward the ea&s;t, becau&s;e the water
is always &s;table near the point of Lofoede, as
formerly remarked, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily proceed
toward the we&s;t, where the water is lower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du courant de Mo&s;ckoe, &amp;c. <HI>Journal &eacute;tranger. Fevrier</HI> 1758, <HI>p.</HI> 25.</NOTE>.'
This explication &s;eems to be comformable to the
true principles of the theory of running waters.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;till add the de&s;cription of the famous
current of Scylla and Charybdis, near the i&s;land
of Sicily concerning which Mr Brydone has late|ly
made &s;ome ob&s;ervations tending to prove that
the violence and rapidity of its movements are
much dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>'It was almo&s;t a dead calm, our &s;hip &s;carce
moving half a mile in an hour, &s;o that we had
time to get a complete view of the famous rock
of Scylla, on the Calabrian &s;ide, Cape Pylorus
on the Sicilian, and the celebrated Straits of
<PB N="112" REF="119">
the Faro that runs between them. Whil&s;t we
were &s;till &s;ome miles di&s;tant from the entry of
the Straits, we heard the roaring of the current,
like the noi&s;e of &s;ome large impetuous river
confined between narrow banks. This in|crea&s;ed
in proportion as we advanced, till we
&s;aw the water in many places rai&s;ed to a con&s;i|derable
height, and forming large eddies or
whirlpools. The &s;ea in every other place was
as &s;mooth as gla&s;s. Our old pilot told us, that
he had often &s;een &s;hips caught in the&s;e eddies,
and whirled about with great rapidity, without
obeying the helm in the &s;malle&s;t degree.
When the weather is calm, there is little danger;
but when the waves meet with this violent
current, it makes a dreadful &s;ea. He &s;ays,
there were five &s;hips wrecked in this &s;pot la&s;t
winter. We ob&s;erved that the current &s;et ex|actly
for the rock of Scylla, and would infal|libly
have carried any thing thrown into it a|gain&s;t
that point; &s;o that it was not without
rea&s;on the ancients have painted it as an object
of &s;uch terror. It is about a mile from the
entry of the Faro, and forms a &s;mall promon|tory,
which runs a little out to &s;ea, and meets
the whole force of the waters, as they come
out of the narrowe&s;t part of the Straits. The
head of this promontory is the famous Scylla.
It mu&s;t be owned that it does not altogether
come up to the formidable de&s;cription that
<PB N="113" REF="120">
Homer gives of it; the reading of which (like
that of Shake&s;pear's Cliff) almo&s;t makes one's
head giddy. Neither is the pa&s;&s;age &s;o wonder|ous
narrow and difficult as he makes it. In|deed
it is probable that the breadth of it is great|ly
increa&s;ed &s;ince his time, by the violent im|petuo&s;ity
of the current. And this violence, too,
mu&s;t have always dimini&s;hed, in proportion as
the breadth of the channel increa&s;ed. The
rock is near 200 feet high. There is a kind of
ca&s;tle or fort built on its &s;ummit; and the
town of Scylla, or Sciglio, containing three or
four hundred inhabitants, &s;tands on its &s;outh
&s;ide, and gives the title of prince to a Calabre&s;e
family. We lay ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to Cape Pylorus
where the light-hou&s;e is now built. . . . . The
mouth of the Straits, betwixt the promontories
of Pylorus in Sicily, and the Coda de Volpe in
Calabria, appears &s;carcely to be a mile. But
the channel enlarges to four miles in breadth
near Me&s;&s;ina, which is twelve miles from the
mouth of the Straits. . . The celebrated gulf
or whirlpool of Charybdis lies near to the en|try
of the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina, and often occa|&s;ions
&s;uch an inte&s;tine and irregular motion in
the water, that the helm lo&s;es mo&s;t of its power,
and &s;hips have great difficulty to get in, even
with the faire&s;t wind that can blow. . . . Ari|&s;totle
gives a long and formidable de&s;cription
of it in his 125th chapter, De Admirandis,
<PB N="114" REF="121">
which I find tran&s;lated in an old Sicilian book
I have got here. It begins, 'Adeo profun|dum,
horridumque &s;pectaculum,' &amp;c. but it is
too long to tran&s;cribe. It is likewi&s;e de&s;cribed
by Homer, 12th of the Ody&s;&s;ey; Virgil, 3d
Aeneid; Lucretius, Ovid, Sallu&s;t, Seneca, as
al&s;o by many of the old Italian and Sicilian
poets, who all &s;peak of it in terms of horror;
and repre&s;ent it as an object that in&s;pired terror,
even when looked on at a di&s;tance. It certain|ly
is not now &s;o formidable; and very proba|bly,
the violence of this motion, continued for
&s;o many ages, has by degrees worn &s;mooth the
rugged rocks, and jutting &s;helves, that may
have intercepted and confined the waters. The
breadth of the Straits too, in this place, I make
no doubt is con&s;iderably enlarged. Indeed,
from the nature of things it mu&s;t be &s;o; the
perpetual friction occa&s;ioned by the current
mu&s;t wear away the bank on each &s;ide, and
enlarge the bed of the water.'</P>
<P>'The ve&s;&s;els in this pa&s;&s;age were obliged to
go as near as po&s;&s;ible to the coa&s;t of Calabria,
in order to avoid the &s;uction occa&s;ioned by the
whirling of the waters in this vortex; by
which means, when they came to the narrowe&s;t
and mo&s;t rapid part of the Straits, betwixt
Cape Pylorus and Scylla, they were in great
danger of being carried upon that rock. From
whence the proverb, &s;till applied to tho&s;e who,
<PB N="115" REF="122">
in attempting to avoid one evil, fall into an|other,
'Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Carybdim.'
Here another light-hou&s;e is placed to warn
&s;ailors of their approach to Charybdis, as that

<HEAD>Of Reflected Wind, p. 379.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall here mention a fact which &s;eems to
ve e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of natural
philo&s;ophers, though every man is in a condi|tion
to convince him&s;elf of its truth. The fact is
that the reflected wind is more violent than the
direct, and &s;till more &s;o in proportion to the
nearne&s;s of the ob&s;tacle by which it is reflected.
I have often made the experiment by approach|ing
a tower, of near a hundred feet high, and
&s;ituated at the north of my garden at Montbard.
When a &s;trong &s;outh wind blows, we are vi|olently
pu&s;hed back, at the di&s;tance of thirty
paces: After which, there is an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> interval for
five or &s;ix paces, where the violence of the re|flected
wind cea&s;es, and &s;eems to be in equilibri|um
with the direct. The nearer we approach,
the &s;trength of the reflected wind augments,
<PB N="117" REF="124">
and pu&s;hes us back with much greater force
than the direct wind pu&s;hes us forward. The
cau&s;e of this general effect, which may be per|ceived
oppo&s;ite to any high buildings, preci|pices,
&amp;c. it is not difficult to di&s;cover. The

a volume of air of double or triple the den&s;ity

<HEAD>Of the &s;tate of the Air at the top of high Moun|tains.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been proved by a thou&s;and experi|ments,
that the higher we ri&s;e above the level
of the &s;ea or of plains, the column of mercury in
the barometer &s;inks the lower; and, con&s;equent|ly,
that the weight of a column of air dimini&s;h|es
in proportion to the elevation of the place;
and as air is an ela&s;tic and compre&s;&s;ible fluid,
<PB N="118" REF="125">
philo&s;ophers have unanimou&s;ly concluded from
the&s;e experiments, that the air is much more
den&s;e and compre&s;&s;ed in the plains, than on
the tops of mountains. For example, if the
barometer, which &s;tands at 27 inches in the
plain, falls, on the top of a mountain, to 18, a
difference of one third of the whole weight of
the column of air, we &s;ay, that, the compre&s;&s;ion
of this element being always proportioned to
the incumbent weight, the air at the top of the
mountain is, of cour&s;e, one third le&s;s den&s;e
than that in the plain, becau&s;e it is compre&s;&s;ed
by a weight one third le&s;s. But &s;trong rea&s;ons
concur in making me &s;u&s;pect the truth of this
conclu&s;ion, which has hitherto been regarded as
natural, and perfectly legitimate.</P>
<P>Let us, for a moment, ab&s;tract this compre&s;&s;i|bility
of the air, which &s;everal cau&s;es may aug|ment
or dimini&s;h, de&s;troy or compen&s;ate: Let
us &s;uppo&s;e the air to be every where equally
den&s;e; if its thickne&s;s exceeded not three
leagues, it is certain, that, in mounting one
league, the barometer, being loaded with one
third le&s;s weight, would de&s;cend from 27 to 18
inches. Now the air though compre&s;&s;ible, ap|pears
to me to be equally den&s;e at all heights;
and this opinion I &s;hall &s;upport by the following
facts and rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>1. The winds are equally &s;trong, and equal|ly
violent at the tops of the highe&s;t mountains
<PB N="119" REF="126">
as in the lowe&s;t valleys. With regard to this
fact all ob&s;ervers are agreed. Now, if the den|&s;ity
of the air were one third le&s;s, the action of
the wind would nece&s;&s;arily be one third weaker,
and all the winds at the height of a league
would be only zephirs, which is ab&s;olutely
contradicted by uniform experience.</P>
<P>2. Eagles, and &s;everal other birds, not only
fly to the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, but ri&s;e
to great heights above them. Now, I a&s;k if
the&s;e animals could either fly, or even &s;upport
them&s;elves, in a fluid one third le&s;s den&s;e than
common air, and if the weight of their bodies,
notwith&s;tanding all their efforts, would not o|blige
them to &s;ink lower?</P>
<P>3. All ob&s;ervers, who have climbed to the
tops of the highe&s;t mountains, agree that they
re&s;pire as freely as in any other &s;ituation, and
that the only inconveniency they feel ari&s;es
from the cold, which augments in proportion
to the elevation. Now, if the air was one
third le&s;s den&s;e at the tops of mountains, the
re&s;piration of man, and of birds which mount
&s;till higher, would not only be injured, but
&s;topped, as actually happens to animals in an
air pump when one fourth or one third of the
air contained in the receiver is exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>4. As cold conden&s;es as much as heat rare|&s;ies
the air, and as, in proportion to the eleva|tion
of mountains, the cold increa&s;es, does it
<PB N="120" REF="127">
not follow, that the degrees of conden&s;ation
of the air corre&s;pond to the degrees of cold?
This conden&s;ation may equal, and even &s;urpa&s;s
that of the air in plains, where the heat e|&s;caping
from the internal parts of the earth is
much greater than at the tops of mountains,
which are the mo&s;t advanced and colde&s;t points
on the &s;urface of the globe. Hence this con|den&s;ation
of the air by cold, in high regions of
the atmo&s;phere, &s;hould compen&s;ate the diminu|tion
of den&s;ity produced by a decrea&s;e of the in|cumbent
weight; and, of cour&s;e, the air &s;hould
be equally den&s;e on the cold &s;ummits of moun|tains
as in the plains. I am even led to think,
that the air is more den&s;e on the tops of moun|tains,
becau&s;e there the winds &s;eem to be more
violent, and the birds which &s;oar above the
highe&s;t &s;ummits appear to &s;upport them&s;elves
in the air with more ea&s;e in proportion to the
height they ri&s;e.</P>
<P>I may, therefore, conclude, that the free air
is nearly of equal den&s;ity at all heights, and
that the atmo&s;phere extends not &s;o high as has
been determined, by con&s;idering the air as an e|la&s;tic
ma&s;s compre&s;&s;ed by an incumbent weight.
Thus the total thickne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere may
not exceed three leagues, in&s;tead of from fif|teen
to twenty, as has been conjectured by
philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Alhazen, from the duration of the twilights, pretended that the height of the atmo&s;phere is 44331 fathoms. Kepler, upon the &s;ame principle, makes it 41110 fathoms.</P>
<P>M. de la Hire, when treating of the horizontal refraction of 32 minutes, fixes the mean height of the atmo&s;phere at 34585 fathoms.</P>
<P>M. Mariotte, from his experiments on the compre&s;&s;ibility of air, makes the height of the atmo&s;phere 30000 fathoms.</P>
<P>However, comprehending under the atmo&s;phere that part of the air only in which refractions take place, M. Bouguer a&s;certains the height not to be above 5158 fathoms, i. e. two and a half or three leagues; and I believe that this re&s;ult is more certain and better founded than any of the others.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="128">
The fir&s;t &s;tratum of the atmo&s;phere is filled
with vapours exhaled from the &s;urface of the
globe, both by its own heat and that of the &s;un.
In this &s;tratum, which extends to the height
of the clouds, the heat ari&s;ing from exhalations
produces and &s;upports a rarefaction that forms
an equipoi&s;e to the &s;uperior air; &s;o that the
lower &s;tratum of the atmo&s;phere is not &s;o den&s;e
as it ought to be in proportion to the pre&s;&s;ure
it receives. But, at the height where this
rarefaction cea&s;es, the air undergoes all that
conden&s;ation which is produced by the cold of
this region, where the heat ari&s;ing from the
earth is much dimini&s;hed; and this conden&s;a|tion
appears to be even greater than that which
might be produced, by the weight of the &s;u|perior
&s;trata, in the inferior regions, which
are &s;upported by rarefaction. This idea is
&s;trengthened by another phaenomenon, which
<PB N="122" REF="129">
is the conden&s;ation and &s;u&s;pen&s;ation of the
clouds in that elevated region where they are
formed and &s;upported. Beyond this middle
region, where the cold and conden&s;ation com|mence,
the vapours ri&s;e, but cea&s;e to be vi&s;ible,
except when a part of a cold &s;tratum &s;eems to
be pu&s;hed back toward the &s;urface of the
earth, and when the heat e&s;caping from the
earth being for &s;ome time extingui&s;hed by
rains, the vapours then collect and thicken a|round
us in the form of mi&s;ts and fogs. With|out
the&s;e circum&s;tances, the vapours never be|come
vi&s;ible till they arrive at that region
where the cold conden&s;es them into clouds,
and &s;tops their further a&s;cen&s;ion: Their gravi|ty,
which augments in proportion as they be|come
more den&s;e, fixes them in an equipoi&s;e
which they cannot &s;urmount. We perceive that
the clouds are generally higher in &s;ummer, and
&s;till higher in warm climates. It is in this &s;ea&s;on
and in the&s;e climates that the &s;tratum formed by
evaporation from the earth ri&s;es highe&s;t. On the
contrary, in the frozen regions near the pole,
where the evaporation produced by the heat
of the globe is much le&s;s, the &s;tratum of den&s;e
air &s;eems to touch the &s;urface, and there to re|tain
the clouds, which never ri&s;e higher, but

<HEAD>Of &s;ome Winds which have a regular variation.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain climates and particular
countries where the winds vary regularly; &s;ome
at the end of &s;ix months, others in a few weeks,
others from morning to night, and from night to
morning. In Vol. I. p. 388. I remarked, That,
<HI>at St Domingo, there are two different winds
which ri&s;e regularly every day; the one, which
is from the &s;ea, comes from the ea&s;t, and begins at</HI>
10 <HI>o'clock before noon; the other, which is a land|wind,
ri&s;es at</HI> 6 <HI>or</HI> 7 <HI>in the evening, and continues
the whole night.</HI> M. Fre&s;naye writes me, that
my information has not been exact. 'The two
regular winds,' he remarks, 'which blow at
St Domingo, are both from the &s;ea, and blow,
the one in the morning from the ea&s;t, and the
other in the evening from the we&s;t, which is
only the &s;ame wind returned. It is evidently
occa&s;ioned by the &s;un; for, every man perceives
that, between one and two o'clock after noon,
a tran&s;ient gu&s;t ari&s;es. When the &s;un de|clines,
by rarefying the air on the we&s;t, it drives
to the ea&s;t the clouds which the morning wind
had confined toward the oppo&s;ite quarter.
<PB N="124" REF="131">
The&s;e returned clouds, from April or May till
toward autumn, produce in the di&s;trict of Port|au-Prince
the regular rains which con&s;tantly
proceed from the ea&s;t. There is not a &s;ingle
inhabitant who does not predict the evening
rain between &s;ix and nine o'clock, when, accor|ding

not during the whole night. It falls
regularly toward the evening; and, when it
cea&s;es, the clouds pu&s;hed from the ea&s;t are en|abled
to fall in the form of rain, as &s;oon as their
weight exceeds that of an equal column of air.
The wind which prevails in the night is a land|wind,
which proceeds neither from the ea&s;t
nor the we&s;t, but follows the projections of
the coa&s;t. At Port-au-Prince, the &s;outh wind,

<HEAD>Of Lavanges, or great ma&s;&s;es of Snow and Ice
rolling down from high mountains.</HEAD>
<P>IN high mountains, there are winds produced
by accidental cau&s;es, and particularly by <HI>lavan|ges</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know no &s;ingle Engli&s;h word expre&s;&s;ive of this idea, and therefore retain the French term.</NOTE>.
In the environs of the Alpine glacieres,
&s;everal &s;pecies of <HI>lavanges</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hable;
&s;ome of them are called <HI>windy lavanges,</HI> becau&s;e
they produce a great wind. They are formed
when a new fall of &s;now has been put in motion,
either from melting below by the interior heat
of the earth, or by the agitation of the air. The
&s;now then forms it&s;elf into balls, and in rolling
accumulates, falls in va&s;t ma&s;&s;es into the valleys,
and produces a great agitation in the air;
becau&s;e the &s;now runs with rapidity, and in
immen&s;e volumes, and the winds occa&s;ioned by
the motion of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es are &s;o impetuous, that
they overturn every thing, even the large&s;t pines,
that oppo&s;e their pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e lavanges
cover the whole territory over which they extend
with a very fine &s;now; and this powdered &s;now
ri&s;es in the air at the caprice of the winds, <HI>i. e.</HI>
without any fixed direction, which is extremely
<PB N="126" REF="133">
dangerous to people in the fields; becau&s;e they
know not to what &s;ide to run in order to protect
them&s;elves; for, in a few &s;econds, they find
them&s;elves &s;urrounded, and often completely
buried with the &s;now.</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies of <HI>lavanges,</HI> &s;till more dange|rous
than the fir&s;t, is called by the country peo|ple
Schlaglawen, <HI>i. e. da&s;hing</HI> or <HI>&s;triking lavan|ges.</HI>
They proceed not with &s;uch rapidity as
the fir&s;t kind; but they overturn every thing
in their way, and carry along with them great
quantities of earth, &s;tones, flints, and even en|tire
trees; &s;o that their pa&s;&s;age from the moun|tain
to the valley is a va&s;t track of de&s;truction
and ruin. As they proceed with le&s;s rapidity
than the <HI>lavanges</HI> compo&s;ed of pure &s;now, they
are more ea&s;ily avoided. Their approach is an|nounced
at a di&s;tance; for they &s;hake the
mountains and the valleys by their motion and
weight, and produce a noi&s;e equal to that of
thunder.</P>
<P>The&s;e tremendous effects may proceed from
very &s;light cau&s;es: A &s;mall quantity of &s;now
falling from a tree or a rock, the &s;ound of bells,
or the &s;hock of a cannon or mu&s;ket, provided
they detach &s;ome portions of &s;now from the
&s;ummit, which form into balls, and increa&s;e in
magnitude as they de&s;cend, will accumulate in|to
a ma&s;s as large as a &s;mall mountain before
they arrive at the valley.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">
The inhabitants of countries &s;ubject to <HI>lavan|ges</HI>
have invented &s;everal precautions to prevent
their de&s;tructive effects. They place their build|ings
oppo&s;ite to &s;mall eminences, which may
break the force of the <HI>lavanges.</HI> They likewi&s;e
make plantations of wood before their habita|tions.
At Mount St Godard, there is a fore&s;t
in a triangular form, the acute angle of which
is directed towards the mountain, and &s;eems to
have been planted with a view to turn off the
<HI>lavanges</HI> from the village of Ur&s;eren and the
buildings &s;ituated at the foot of the mountain;
and every per&s;on is forbid, under the &s;evere&s;t
penalties, to injure the fore&s;t, which may be re|garded
as the &s;afeguard of the village. With
the &s;ame intention there are, in many places,
walls erected with their acute angles turned to|ward
the mountain. A wall of this kind may
be &s;een at Davis, in the country of the Gri&s;ons,
as al&s;o near the baths of Leuk or Louache in Va|lais.
In the &s;ame country of the Gri&s;ons, and o|ther
places, there are, in the pa&s;&s;ages through
the mountains, vaults at convenient di&s;tances,
cut out of the rock on the &s;ide of the high-way,

<HEAD>Of Water-Spouts.</HEAD>
<P>M. de la Nux, whom I have often quoted,
and who lived forty years in the i&s;le of Bour|bon,
has had an opportunity of &s;eeing a great
number of water-&s;pouts, and he has commu|nicated
to me his ob&s;ervations, of which the
following is an abridgement.</P>
<P>The water-&s;pouts ob&s;erved by M. de la Nux
were formed, 1. In calm days, and in tho&s;e in|tervals
when the wind pa&s;&s;es from the &s;outh to
the north; though he &s;aw one, which was form|ed
previous to this pa&s;&s;age of the wind from one
quarter to another, and even in the current of a
north wind, <HI>i e.</HI> a pretty long time before this
wind had cea&s;ed: The cloud from which this
water-&s;pout depended, and to which it was at|tached,
was &s;till violently driven to the &s;outh.
The &s;un, at the &s;ame time, was &s;een behind the
<PB N="130" REF="137">
cloud to the &s;outh. It happened on the 6th day
of January, about eleven o'clock before noon.</P>
<P>2. The&s;e water-&s;pouts are formed during the
day in detached clouds, apparently very thick,
much longer than broad, and well defined be|low
in the direction of the horizon: The under
part of the&s;e clouds is always very black.</P>
<P>3. All the&s;e water-&s;pouts at fir&s;t appear under
the form of inverted cones, who&s;e ba&s;es are
more or le&s;s exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>4. Several of tho&s;e water-&s;pouts that appear
under the figure of inverted cones, are &s;ome|times
attached to the &s;ame cloud; &s;ome are
never entirely completed; &s;ome are di&s;&s;ipa|ted
at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the cloud; and o|thers
de&s;cend apparently very near to the &s;urface
of the &s;ea, under the form of a long flat cone,
which is narrow and pointed at the bottom. In
the centre of this cone, and through its whole
length, there is a whiti&s;h tran&s;parent canal, a|bout
one third of the diameter of the cone, the
two &s;ides of which were very black, e&s;pecially
on their fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P>The&s;e water-&s;pouts were ob&s;erved from a
point in the i&s;le of Bourbon elevated 150 fa|thoms
above the level of the &s;ea, and they were
generally three, four, or five leagues from the
place of ob&s;ervation, which was the hou&s;e of
M. de la Nux.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="138">
The following is a more particular de&s;cription
of the&s;e water-&s;pouts.</P>
<P>When the end of the &s;haft, or top of the
cone, which is then very &s;harp pointed, has de|&s;cended
about a fourth of the di&s;tance of the
cloud from the &s;ea, we begin to perceive on its
&s;urface, which is commonly calm and of a tran&s;|parent
whitene&s;s, a &s;mall black circle, which is
produced by the agitation and whirling of the
water: In proportion as the point of this &s;haft
de&s;cends, the water boils; this boiling increa&s;es
in proportion as the point approaches toward
the &s;urface, and the water of the &s;ea ri&s;es in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
whirlings to a greater or &s;maller height,
which, in the large&s;t water &s;pouts, is about
twenty-feet. The end of the &s;haft is always a|bove
this whirling, the &s;ize of which is propor|tioned
to that of the water-&s;pout which puts it
in motion. The end of the &s;haft &s;eems not to
touch the &s;urface of the &s;ea, otherwi&s;e than by
joining it&s;elf to the boiling or whirling which
ri&s;es to meet it.</P>
<P>We &s;ometimes &s;ee larger and &s;maller cones of
water-&s;pouts proceeding from the &s;ame cloud;
&s;ome of them have the appearance of threads,
and others are much larger. We often &s;ee ten
or a dozen of &s;mall but complete water-&s;pouts
i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame cloud, mo&s;t of which are
di&s;&s;ipated near their exit, and vi&s;ibly a&s;cend to
the cloud. In this la&s;t ca&s;e, the &s;haft &s;uddenly
<PB N="132" REF="139">
&s;wells as far as the inferior extremity, and ap|pears
like a cylinder &s;u&s;pended from the cloud,
torn in pieces below, and of a &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>The water-&s;pouts with broad ba&s;es gradually
enlarge through their whole extent, and like|wi&s;e
in the under end, which &s;eems to recede
from the &s;ea and to approach the cloud. The
agitation and whirling they produce in the wa|ter
gradually dimini&s;hes, and the under part of
the &s;haft &s;oon enlarges and a&s;&s;umes nearly a cy|lindrical
form. It is in this &s;tate that the two
&s;ides of the canal widen; and we then &s;ee the
water ru&s;hing with rapidity, and in a &s;piral
form, into the cloud. La&s;tly, the appearance
of the water-&s;pout terminates by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
&s;hortening of this &s;pecies of cylinder.</P>
<P>The large&s;t water-&s;pouts remain longe&s;t with|out
di&s;&s;ipating; and &s;ome of them continue more
than half an hour.</P>
<P>A torrent of rain generally ru&s;hes out of the
&s;am&eacute; part of the cloud from which the water|&s;pouts
i&s;&s;ue, and &s;ome of them not unfrequent|ly
&s;till adhere to the cloud; the&s;e torrents of
rain often conceal water-&s;pouts before they are
di&s;&s;ipated. I perceived di&s;tinctly, M. de la Nux
remarks, on the 26th of October 1755, a wa|ter-&s;pout
in the middle of one of the&s;e torrents,
which became &s;o great that it was &s;oon conceal|ed
from my view.</P>
<P>The wind, or the agitation of the air below
<PB N="133" REF="140">
the cloud, breaks neither the large nor the &s;mall
water-&s;pouts; for this impul&s;ion only declines
them from the perpendicular. The &s;malle&s;t
kinds form very remarkable curves, and even &s;i|nuo&s;ities.
The extremity which terminates in
the &s;ea is often far removed from the direction
of the other which is attached to the cloud.</P>
<P>We never &s;ee new water-&s;pouts formed after
rain has fallen from the clouds which produced
them.</P>
<P>'On the 14th day of June 1756, about four
o'clock afternoon, I was,' &s;ays M. de la Nux,
'on the margin of the &s;ea, and above its level
twenty or twenty-five feet. I &s;aw twelve or
fourteen water-&s;pouts i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ame
cloud. Three of them only were con&s;iderable,
and particularly the la&s;t. The canal in the
middle of the cylinder was &s;o tran&s;parent, that,
as the &s;un &s;hone, I &s;aw the clouds behind it.
The cloud which produced &s;o many water|&s;pouts
extended nearly from &s;outh-ea&s;t to
&s;outh-we&s;t; and the large water-&s;pout under
con&s;ideration appeared in the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t
from my &s;tation. The &s;un was very low; for
the days were then about the &s;horte&s;t. I &s;aw no
rain proceed from the cloud: Its height &s;eem|ed
to be from five to &s;ix hundred fathoms.'</P>
<P>The more the &s;ky is ob&s;cured with clouds,
water-&s;pouts, and the phaenomena which ac|company
them, are the more ea&s;ily ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="141">
M. de la Nux thinks, and perhaps with rea|&s;on,
that water-&s;pouts are nothing but vi&s;cous
portions of a cloud driven off by different whirl|winds,
<HI>i. e.</HI> by the whirlings of the &s;uperior air
&s;inking into the ma&s;s of vapours of which the
whole cloud is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>What &s;eems to prove that the&s;e water-&s;pouts
are compo&s;ed of vi&s;cous parts, is the tenaciou&s;|ne&s;s
of their cohe&s;ion; for they make inflexions
and curvatures in every direction, without
breaking: If the matter of water-&s;pouts was not
vi&s;cous, how can we conceive that they &s;hould,
without breaking, bend and obey the motion of
the winds? If all the parts did not firmly ad|here,
the wind would di&s;&s;ipate them, or, at
lea&s;t, make them change their form. But, as
the form, both of the large and &s;mall water|&s;pouts,
is uniformly the &s;ame, this is almo&s;t a
certain indication of the vi&s;cous tenacity of the
matter of which they are compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus the ba&s;is of the matter of water-&s;pouts
is a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance contained in the clouds,
and every water-&s;pout is formed by a whirlwind
of air pre&s;&s;ing through the ma&s;s of vapours, and,
by blowing up the inferior part of the cloud,
pierces it, and de&s;cends with its covering of vi&s;|cous
matter. And, as complete water-&s;pouts
de&s;cend from the cloud to the &s;urface of the &s;ea,
the water mu&s;t boil and whirl at the place to
which the end of the water-&s;pout is directed;
<PB N="135" REF="142">
becau&s;e the air blows from the extremity of the
water-&s;pout like the tube of a pair of bellows.
The effects of this blowing upon the &s;ea will
augment, in proportion as the cylinder approach|es
the &s;urface of the water; and, when the o|rifice
of the tube enlarges, a greater quantity of
air is permitted to e&s;cape, and the agitation of
the water is, of cour&s;e, increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>It has been imagined, that water-&s;pouts car|ried
off and contained great quantities of &s;ea|water:
The rains, or rather the &s;pray, which
often fall in the neighbourhood of water-&s;pouts,
have &s;trengthened this prejudice. The canal
in the middle of every &s;pecies of water-&s;pout is
always tran&s;parent, on whatever &s;ide it is view|ed.
If the water of the &s;ea &s;eems to ri&s;e, it is
not in this canal, but only on its &s;ides. Almo&s;t
every water-&s;pout &s;uffers inflections, and often
in oppo&s;ite directions, in the form of an <HI>S,</HI> the
one end of which is in the cloud, and the other
in the &s;ea. Hence the&s;e water-&s;pouts of which
we have been treating, cannot contain water
either to be poured into the &s;ea, or rai&s;ed to the
cloud. Of cour&s;e, they can be attended with
no danger, except what proceeds from the im|petuo&s;ity
of the air which e&s;capes from their in|ferior
orifice; for we are a&s;&s;ured by every per|&s;on
who has had an opportunity of ob&s;erving
the&s;e water-&s;pouts, that they are &s;olely compo|&s;ed
of air confined in a vi&s;cous cloud, and de|termined
<PB N="136" REF="143">
by its whirling to the &s;urface of the
&s;ea.</P>
<P>M. de la Nux has &s;een water &s;pouts around
the i&s;le of Bourbon in the months of January,
May, June, and October, <HI>i. e.</HI> in all &s;ea&s;ons of
the year. He has &s;een them in calm weather, and
during the highe&s;t winds. The&s;e phaenomena,
however, may be &s;aid to be rare, and &s;eldom
appear but upon the &s;ea; becau&s;e the vi&s;co&s;ity
of the clouds can only proceed from the bitumi|nous
and grea&s;y particles rai&s;ed, by the heat of
the &s;un and the winds, from the waters of the
&s;ea, and collected in the clouds near its &s;urface.
It is for this rea&s;on that water-&s;pouts &s;eldom ap|per
on land, where there is not, as on the &s;ur|face
of the &s;ea, a &s;ufficient quantity of bitumi|nous
and oily particles to be exhaled by the ac|tion
of the &s;un. They are &s;ometimes, however,
ob&s;erved on land, and even at great di&s;tances
from the &s;ea; this effect may be produced, when
vi&s;cous clouds have been rapidly driven by a
violent wind from the &s;ea toward the land. M.
Grignon, in the month of June 1768, &s;aw a
well formed water-&s;pout in Lorrain near Vau|villier,
among the hills which are a continuation
of the Vo&s;ges. It was about fifty fathoms high.
Its form was that of a column, and it commu|nicated
with a large thick cloud. It was impell|ed
by one or &s;everal winds, which made the wa|ter-&s;pout
turn rapidly; and it produced lightning
<PB N="137" REF="144">
and thunder. This water-&s;pout continued &s;even
or eight minutes only, and broke upon the ba&s;e
of the hill, which is from five to &s;ix hundred
feet high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Grignon to M. de Buffon, Aug. 6. 1777.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Water-&s;pouts have been mentioned by &s;everal
voyagers; but no man has examined them with
&s;uch accuracy as M. de la Nux. For example,
the&s;e voyagers tell us, that, when water-&s;pouts
are forming, a black &s;moke ri&s;es on the &s;urface of
the &s;ea: This appearance, we are certain, is de|ceitful,
and proceeds &s;olely from the &s;ituation
of the ob&s;erver. If he is placed on a &s;ituation &s;o
elevated that the di&s;tance of the whirling exci|ted
in the water by the &s;pout, exceeds not his
&s;en&s;ible horizon, he will &s;ee nothing but the
water ri&s;ing and falling back in rains, without
any mixture of &s;moke. This fact is apparent
when the &s;un &s;hines on the place where the
phaenomenon happens.</P>
<P>The&s;e water-&s;pouts have nothing in common
with tho&s;e agitations and &s;moke &s;ometimes pro|duced
by &s;ubmarine fires, and of which we have
formerly treated. Water-&s;pouts neither contain
nor excite any &s;moke. They are every where
rare: They are mo&s;t frequent in the &s;eas of warm
climates, and where, at the &s;ame time, calms
are common, and the winds are mo&s;t incon&s;tant.
They are likewi&s;e more frequent, perhaps, near
i&s;lands and coa&s;ts than in the open &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>Of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>EARTHQUAKES are produced by two
cau&s;es: The fir&s;t is the &s;udden &s;inking
of cavities in the bowels of the earth; and the
&s;econd, which is &s;till more frequent and more
violent than the fir&s;t, is the action of &s;ubterra|neous
fires.</P>
<P>When a cavern &s;inks in the middle of a con|tinent,
it produces a commotion which extends
to a greater or &s;maller di&s;tance, in proportion to
the quantity of motion excited by the fall of this
ma&s;s of earth; and, if this ma&s;s is incon&s;idera|ble,
or falls from no great height, it will not
produce a &s;uccu&s;&s;ion &s;o violent as to be perceived
at a great di&s;tance; the effect is limited to the
neighbourhood of the &s;unk cavern; and if the
movement is propagated to greater di&s;tances,
it is only by &s;light tremblings or vibrations.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="146">
As mo&s;t of the primitive mountains re&s;t upon
caverns, becau&s;e, at the moment of their con|&s;olidation,
the&s;e eminences were blown up by
the action of the internal fire, &s;inkings in the
mountains have happened, and &s;till happen,
whenever the vaults of the caverns are under|mined
by water, or &s;haken by any convul|&s;ion.
An entire portion of a mountain &s;ome|times
&s;inks perpendicularly, but oftener inclines,
and not unfrequently rever&s;es. Of this we have
&s;triking examples in &s;everal of the Pyrennees,
where the &s;trata, formerly horizontal, are often
inclined more than forty-five degrees; which
&s;hows, that the entire ma&s;s of each portion of
the mountain, who&s;e &s;trata were parallel to each
other, has inclined by the lump, and, in the
moment of its &s;inking, re&s;ted upon a ba&s;e in|clined
to the horizon forty-five degrees. This
is the mo&s;t general cau&s;e of the inclination of
&s;trata in mountains. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, we
often find, between the adjacent eminences,
&s;trata which de&s;cend from the fir&s;t and ri&s;e to
the &s;econd, after having traver&s;ed the valley.
The&s;e &s;trata are horizontal, and are bedded at
the &s;ame height in the two oppo&s;ite hills, be|tween
which the cavern had fallen in. The
earth &s;inks down, and the valley is formed,
without producing any other derangement than
a greater or &s;maller inclination of the &s;trata, ac|cording
<PB N="140" REF="147">
to the depth of the valley, or the decli|vity
of the two oppo&s;ite hills.</P>
<P>This is the only &s;en&s;ible effect of the &s;inking
of caverns in mountains and other parts of con|tinents.
But, whenever this effect happens in
the bottom of the &s;ea, where &s;inkings mu&s;t be more
frequent than on the land, becau&s;e the water per|petually
undermines the vaults in every place
where they &s;upport the bottom of the ocean,
the&s;e &s;inkings not only derange and incline the
&s;trata, but &s;en&s;ibly lower the level of the &s;ea.
From the fir&s;t occupation of the waters, their
level has been depre&s;&s;ed two thou&s;and fathoms
by the&s;e &s;inkings; and, as all the &s;ubmarine ca|verns
have not yet fallen in, it is more than pro|bable,
that the ba&s;in of the &s;ea, by growing
more and more deep, will le&s;&s;en its &s;urface,
and, of cour&s;e, that the extent of all the conti|nents
will always continue to augment by the
retreat and &s;inking of the waters.</P>
<P>A &s;econd and more powerful cau&s;e than the
fir&s;t concurs in producing the &s;ame effect. This
cau&s;e is the rupture and &s;inking of caverns by
the action of &s;ubmarine fires. It is certain,
that no motion or &s;inking in the bottom of the
&s;ea can happen without dimini&s;hing its &s;urface:
And, if we con&s;ider the general effects of &s;ub|terraneous
fires, we will perceive that, as long
as there is fire, the commotions of the earth will
not be confined to &s;imple tremblings; for the
efforts of fire rai&s;e and open the &s;ea and the land
<PB N="141" REF="148">
by violent and reiterated &s;uccu&s;&s;ions, which not
only overturn and de&s;troy the adjacent lands,
but &s;hake tho&s;e that are di&s;tant, and ravage or
derange every thing in the route of their direc|tion.</P>
<P>The earthquakes occa&s;ioned by &s;ubterraneous
&s;ires generally precede eruptions of volcano's,
and &s;ometimes cea&s;e the moment the fire opens
a pa&s;&s;age through the earth, and carries its flames
into the air. The&s;e dreadful earthquakes &s;ome|times
continue during the whole time of eruptions.
The&s;e two effects are intimately connected.
There is never a great eruption of a volcano
without being preceded, or at lea&s;t accompa|nied,
with an earthquake. But we often feel
very violent &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth without a|ny
eruption of fire. Tho&s;e movements in which
fire has no part, proceed not only from the fir&s;t
cau&s;e, the falling in of caverns, but likewi&s;e
from the action of &s;ubterraneous winds and
&s;torms. There are many examples of lands rai|&s;ed
or &s;unk by the force of the&s;e internal winds.
Sir William Hamilton, a man as re&s;pectable for
his private character, as admirable for the extent
of his knowledge and re&s;earches on this &s;ubject,
told me that he had &s;een between Trente and Ve|rona,
near the village of Roveredo, &s;everal little
hills compo&s;ed of large ma&s;&s;es of calcarious &s;tones,
which had evidently been rai&s;ed by different ex|plo&s;ions
of &s;ubterraneous winds. There is no
<PB N="142" REF="149">
indication of the action of fire upon any of the&s;e
rocks or their fragments. The whole country,
on both &s;ides of the highway, for an extent of
near a league, has, from place to place, been
overturned by the prodigious efforts of &s;ubter|raneous
winds: The inhabitants &s;ay that it hap|pened
&s;uddenly, and was the effect of an earth|quake.</P>
<P>But the force of the wind, however violent,
appears not to be a cau&s;e &s;ufficient to produce
&s;uch great effects; and, though there be no
marks of fire in the&s;e little hills rai&s;ed by the
commotion of the earth, I am per&s;uaded that
they have been elevated by electrical explo&s;ions
of &s;ubterraneous thunder, and that the internal
winds have contributed to this effect &s;olely by
producing electrical &s;torms in the cavities of the
earth. Hence all convul&s;ive movements of the
earth may be referred to three cau&s;es: The fir&s;t
and mo&s;t &s;imple is the &s;inking of caverns; the
&s;econd, &s;torms and &s;ubterraneous thunder; and
the third, the action of fire kindled in the inte|rior
parts of the globe. It is ea&s;y to a&s;cribe
to one or other of the&s;e three cau&s;es all the
phaenomena which accompany or &s;ucceed earth|quakes.</P>
<P>Commotions of the earth &s;ometimes give ri&s;e
to eminences; but they more frequently produce
gulfs. On the 15th day of October 1773, a
gulf opened in the territory of Induno, in the
<PB N="143" REF="150">
State of Modena, the cavity of which was
more than four hundred fathoms wide by two
hundred deep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. hi&s;t. et politique, Dec. 10. 1773, <HI>art. Milan.</HI></NOTE>. In 1726, a mountain of a
con&s;iderable height, &s;ituated in the northern part
of Iceland, was &s;unk in one night by an earth|quake,
and a very deep lake a&s;&s;umed its place.
The &s;ame night, about a league and a half
di&s;tant, an ancient lake, the depth of which was
unknown, was entirely dried up, and its bottom
rai&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to form a pretty high
hill, which &s;till exi&s;ts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Melanges intera&s;&s;ans, tom. 1. p. 159.</NOTE>. In the &s;eas in the
neighbourhood of New Britain, M. Bougain|ville
remarks, earthquakes have terrible effects
on navigation. On the 17th of June, the 12th
and 27th of July 1768, there were three earth|quakes
at Boero, and on the 22d of the &s;ame
month, one at new Brittany. The&s;e earthquakes
&s;ometimes annihilate i&s;lands and known &s;and|banks,
and &s;ometimes create them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage autour du Monde, tom. 2. p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are earthquakes which extend to great
di&s;tances; but they are always longer than broad.
One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was that felt in
Canada in the year 1663. It extended more
than two hundred leagues in length and one
hundred in breadth, <HI>i. e.</HI> more than twenty
thou&s;and &s;uperficial leagues. The effects of the
la&s;t earthquake in Portugal, which happened
<PB N="144" REF="151">
in our own time, were felt &s;till farther. M. le Che|valier
de Saint-Sauveur, King's commandant
at Merucis, informed M. de Gen&s;anne, that,
when walking on the left margin of Jouante
in Languedoc, the &s;ky &s;uddenly became very
dark, and that, in a moment after, he perceived,
at the foot of the hill which is &s;ituated to the
right of that river, a terrible bright globe of fire:
Immediately there aro&s;e from the bowels of
the earth a con&s;iderable ma&s;s of rocks, and the
whole chain of mountains &s;plit from Merucis
to Florac, an extent of near &s;ix leagues. This
rent, in &s;ome places, is more than two feet wide,
and has partly fallen in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. de Languedoc, par M. de Gen&s;anne, tom. 1. p. 231.</NOTE>. There are other
earthquakes which produce little or no commo|tion.
Kolbe relates, that, on the 24th of
September 1707, from eight to ten o'clock be|fore
noon, the &s;ea ro&s;e upon the land at the
Cape of Good Hope and de&s;cended &s;even times
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and with &s;uch rapidity, that, from
one moment to another, the place was alternate|ly
covered and left by the waters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap de Bonne-E&s;perance, tom. 2. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the effects of earthquakes,
the falling of mountains, and the &s;inking of ca|verns,
I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few facts, which are
<PB N="145" REF="152">
both recent and well atte&s;ted. In Norway, a
whole promontory called <HI>Hammersfields,</HI> &s;ud|denly
fell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. de Norw&eacute;ge, par Pontoppidan; <HI>Journal &eacute;tran|ger, Ao&uacute;t</HI> 1755.</NOTE>. A very high mountain, near that
of Chimbora&ccedil;o, one of the highe&s;t of the Cor|deliers
in the province of Quito, tumbled down
in a moment. This fact, with all its circum|&s;tances,
is related in the memoirs of M. de la
Condamine and Bouguer. Similar fallings
and &s;inkings often happen in the &s;outhern
i&s;lands of India. At Gamma-canore, where
the Dutch have a &s;ettlement, a high mountain
fell &s;uddenly in the year 1673, when the
weather was fine: It was followed by an earth|quake,
which overturned the neighbouring vil|lages,
and de&s;troyed &s;everal thou&s;ands of per|&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. de Voyages, tom. 17. p. 54.</NOTE>.
On the 11th of Augu&s;t 1772, in the
i&s;land of Java and province of Cheribou, one of
the riche&s;t &s;ettlements of the Dutch, a mountain,
of about three leagues in circumference, &s;ud|denly
&s;unk, and ro&s;e and &s;unk alternately like
waves in a &s;tormy ocean: It at the &s;ame
time threw out many globes of fire, which
were &s;een at a great di&s;tance, and gave a light
as brilliant as that of day: All the plantations,
together with about two thou&s;and one hundred
and forty inhabitants, without reckoning &s;tran|gers,
were entirely &s;wallowed up<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See gazette de France, 21. Maii 1773, <HI>art. de la Hai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE>. We might
recite many other examples of the &s;inking of
<PB N="146" REF="153">
lands and &s;wallowing of mountains by the rup|ture
of caverns, and the &s;uccu&s;&s;ions occa&s;ioned
by earthquakes and the action of volcanoe's:
But we have &s;aid enough to e&s;tabli&s;h the
general conclu&s;ions we have drawn from the
facts already related.</P>

<P>THE ancients have left us &s;ome notices con|cerning
the volcano's which were known to
them, and particularly tho&s;e of Aetna and Ve|&s;uvius.
Several learned and curious ob&s;ervers
have in our days examined more minutely

to po&s;terity the exact topography of the&s;e
burning mountains. Their form may be &s;aid
to change daily; their &s;urface ri&s;es or &s;inks in
various places; every eruption produces new
gulfs or new eminences: To attempt to de|&s;cribe
all the&s;e changes, is to follow and paint
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ruins of a burning edifice. The

and from the variation of form and move|ments,

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Changes which have happened in Vol|cano's.</HEAD>
<P>THE ba&s;e of Aetna is about &s;ixty leagues in
circumference, and its perpendicular height a|bout
two thou&s;and fathoms above the level of
the Mediterranean &s;ea. We may, therefore,
regard this enormous mountain as an obtu&s;e
cone, the &s;uperficies of which is not le&s;s than
three hundred &s;quare leagues. This conical
&s;urface is divided into four zones, &s;ituated con|centrically
above each other. The fir&s;t is the
large&s;t, and, by a gradual a&s;cent, extends above
&s;ix leagues from the mo&s;t di&s;tant point at the
foot of the mountain. This zone of &s;ix leagues
broad is almo&s;t totally peopled and cultivated.
The city of Catania and &s;everal villages are &s;itu|ated
in this fir&s;t zone, the &s;urface of which
<PB N="148" REF="155">
exceeds two hundred and twenty &s;quare
leagues. The ba&s;is of this va&s;t territory con&s;i&s;ts
of various &s;trata of ancient and modern lavas,
that have run from different parts of the moun|tain,
from which explo&s;ions of &s;ubterraneous
fires have i&s;&s;ued. The &s;urface of this lava,
mixed with a&s;hes thrown out from different
craters, is converted into a fine &s;oil, which is now
&s;own with grain and planted with vines, except
in a few places where the lava is too recent,
and &s;till remains uncovered with earth. A|bout
the top of the zone, we &s;till &s;ee &s;everal cra|ters,
more or le&s;s large and deep, from which
the materials i&s;&s;ued that have formed the up|per
&s;tratum or &s;oil.</P>
<P>The &s;econd zone commences at the termina|tion
of the&s;e &s;ix leagues. This &s;econd zone is
an a&s;cent of about two leagues broad. Its de|clivity
is every where more rapid than that of
the fir&s;t zone; and this rapidity augments in
proportion as you approach toward the &s;um|mit.
The &s;urface of this &s;econd zone is about
forty or forty-five &s;quare leagues: Its whole
extent is covered with magnificent fore&s;ts, and
form a fine belt of verdure to the white and
hoary head of this venerable mountain. The
&s;oil of the&s;e fine fore&s;ts is nothing but lava and
a&s;hes converted by the operation of time into
excellent earth. What is &s;till more remarkable,
the &s;urface of this zone is &s;o unequal, that it e|very

where pre&s;ents hills, or rather mountains;
all of which have been produced by different
eruptions from the &s;ummit of Aetna, and other
craters below the &s;ummit, &s;everal of which
have formerly acted in this very zone, now
converted into fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>Before arriving at the &s;ummit, and after
having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e fine fore&s;ts, we traver&s;e a
third zone, which gives birth to &s;mall vegetables
only. In winter, this region is covered with
&s;now, which melts in &s;ummer. We afterwards
meet with a line of permanent &s;now, which
marks the commencement of the fourth zone,
and extends to the top of the mountain. The&s;e
&s;nows and ice occupy about two leagues from
the region of &s;mall vegetables to the &s;ummit,
which is likewi&s;e covered with &s;now and ice.
Its figure is an exact cone; and it contains
the great crater of the volcano; from which are
continually di&s;charged immen&s;e volumes of
&s;moke. The internal figure of the crater is
that of an inverted cone. It is compo&s;ed of no|thing
but a&s;hes and other burnt matters thrown
out by the mouth of the crater, which is in the
centre of the volcano. The external &s;urface of
the &s;ummit is very rough. The &s;now is cover|ed
with a&s;hes, and the cold is very piercing:
On the north &s;ide of this region of &s;now, there
are &s;everal &s;mall lakes which never freeze:
In general, the &s;urface of this la&s;t zone is pretty
<PB N="150" REF="157">
equal, and ob&s;erves the &s;ame declivity, except in
a few places; and it is below this region only
where we meet with a great number of ine|qualities,
eminences, and hollows produced by
eruptions, and where we &s;ee hills and moun|tains
more or le&s;s recently formed, and com|po&s;ed
of burnt matters rejected by the&s;e dif|ferent
mouths or craters.</P>
<P>In 1770, according to Mr Brydone, the cra|ter
on the top of Aetna was more than a league
in circumference; and very different dimen&s;ions
have been a&s;cribed to it both by ancient and mo|dern
authors. All the&s;e authors, however,
were right; for the dimen&s;ions of this mouth of
fire have undergone many alterations. All
we can infer from the various de&s;criptions that
have been given of it, is, that the crater with its
margins have been four times overturned within
the&s;e &s;ix or &s;even hundred years. The mate|rials
of which it is compo&s;ed fall back into the
bowels of the mountain, are again rejected by
fre&s;h eruptions, and form a new crater, which
augments and ri&s;es by degrees, till it again falls
back into the great gulf of the volcano.</P>
<P>The top of the mountain is not the only
place from which the &s;ubterraneous fire has been
di&s;charged. Through the whole territory which
forms the &s;ides and ridge of Aetna, and at great
di&s;tances from the &s;ummit, there are many
<PB N="151" REF="158">
craters which give pa&s;&s;age to the fire, and which
are &s;urrounded with broken rocks that had been
di&s;charged by different eruptions. We may
even reckon &s;everal hills formed by the erup|tions
of the&s;e &s;mall volcano's which &s;urround
the great one. Each of the&s;e hills has a crater
at its top, in the centre of which is a deep
mouth or gulf. Every eruption of Aetna has
produced a new mountain; and, perhaps, Mr
Brydone remarks, their number would determine,
better than any other method, that of the erup|tions
of this famous volcano.</P>
<P>The city of Catania, which is &s;ituated at the
foot of Mount Aetna, has often been laid in ruins
by the lavas which i&s;&s;ued from the&s;e new moun|tains
during the time of their formation. In
a&s;cending from Catania to Nicolo&s;i, we traver&s;e
twelve miles through a country formed by an|cient
lavas, where we &s;ee the mouths of extin|gui&s;hed
volcano's, which at pre&s;ent are fertile
lands, covered with gra&s;s, corn, and vineyards.
The lavas which form this region proceeded
from the eruptions of the &s;mall mountains,
which are every where di&s;per&s;ed over the &s;ides
of Aetna: They are all without exception, ei|ther
regular hemi&s;pheres or cones. In gene|ral,
every eruption rai&s;ed one of the&s;e moun|tains.
Hence the action of the &s;ubterraneous
fires does not always reach the &s;ummit of Aetna.
They often i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ides, and even from
<PB N="152" REF="159">
the foot of this burning mountain. Each e|ruption
from the &s;ides of Aetna commonly pro|duces
a new mountain compo&s;ed of rocks, &s;tones,
and a&s;hes projected to a great di&s;tance by the
force of the fire; and the magnitude of the&s;e
new mountains is proportioned to the duration
of the eruption. If it continues but a few days,
it produces only a little hill, about a league in
circumference at the ba&s;e, and three or four
hundred feet in perpendicular height. But, if
the eruption continues &s;ome months, like that
of 1669, it then gives ri&s;e to a con&s;iderable
mountain of two or three leagues in circumfe|rence,
and nine hundred or a thou&s;and feet
high; and all the&s;e hills produced by Aetna,
&s;ome of which are twelve thou&s;and feet high,
appear only as &s;mall elevations intended to ac|company
the maje&s;ty of the parent mountain.</P>
<P>In Ve&s;uvius, which is a very &s;mall volcano
when compared with Aetna, eruptions from the
&s;ides of the mountain are rare, and the lava ge|nerally
i&s;&s;ues from the crater at the &s;ummit.
But, in Aetna, eruptions more frequently pro|ceed
from the &s;ides than the top, and lava i&s;|&s;ues
abundantly from every new mountain form|ed
by the&s;e eruptions. Mr Brydone, according
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> the information he received from M. Recupero,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> that the ma&s;&s;es of &s;tones projected from
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to &s;uch a height that they take
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne &s;econds of time in de&s;cending to
<PB N="153" REF="160">
the earth; while tho&s;e of Ve&s;uvius fall in nine
&s;econds; hence the &s;tones projected by Ve&s;uvi|us
ri&s;e to the height of 1215 feet, and tho&s;e pro|jected
by Aetna ri&s;e 6615 feet; from which we
may conclude, if the ob&s;ervations be accurate,
that the force of Aetna is to that of Ve&s;uvius as
441 to 81, <HI>i. e.</HI> five or &s;ix times greater. That
Ve&s;uvius is a very feeble volcano, when com|pared
to Aetna, is proved in a more forcible
manner by this circum&s;tance, that Aetna has ac|tually
produced other volcano's, which are
larger than that of Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>'Not a great way from this cavern, are two
of the mo&s;t beautiful mountains of all that
number that &s;pring from Aetna. I mounted
one of our be&s;t mules, and with a good deal
of difficulty arrived at the &s;ummit of the high|e&s;t
of them, ju&s;t a little before &s;un-&s;et. The
pro&s;pect of Sicily, with the &s;urrounding &s;ea
and all its i&s;lands, was wonderfully noble. The
whole cour&s;e of the river Semetus, the ruins
of Hybla, and &s;everal other ancient towns;
the rich corn-fields and vineyards on the low|er
region of the mountain, and the amazing
number of beautiful mountains below, made a
delightful &s;cene. The hollow craters of the&s;e
two mountains are each of them con&s;iderably
larger than that of Ve&s;uvius. They are now
filled with &s;tately oaks, and covered to a great
depth with the riche&s;t &s;oil. I ob&s;erved that
<PB N="154" REF="161">
this region of Aetna, like the former, is com|po&s;ed
of lava; but this is now covered &s;o deep
with earth, that it is no where to be &s;een, but
in the beds of the torrents. In many of the&s;e
it is worn down by the water to the depth of
fifty or &s;ixty feet, and in one of them &s;till con|&s;iderably
more. . . This conical mountain is of
a very great &s;ize; its circumference cannot be
le&s;s than ten miles. Here we took a &s;econd
re&s;t, as the greate&s;t part of our fatigue &s;till re|mained.
The mercury had fallen to 20:4&frac12;.
&mdash;We found this mountain exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep;
and although it had appeared black, yet it was
likewi&s;e covered with &s;now. . . . The pre&s;ent
crater of this immen&s;e volcano is a circle of a|bout
three miles and a half in circumference.
It goes &s;helving down on each &s;ide, and forms
a regular hollow like a va&s;t amphitheatre.
From many places of this &s;pace, i&s;&s;ue volumes
of &s;ulphureous &s;moke, which, being much
heavier than the circumambient air, in&s;tead of
ri&s;ing in it, as &s;moke generally does, imme|diately
on its getting out of the crater, rolls
down the &s;ide of the mountain like a torrent,
till coming to that part of the atmo&s;phere of
the &s;ame &s;pecific gravity with it&s;elf, it &s;hoots off
horizontally, and forms a large track in the
air, according to the direction of the wind;
which, happily for us, carried it exactly to the
&s;ide oppo&s;ite to that where we were placed.
<PB N="155" REF="162">
The crater is &s;o hot, that it is very dangerous,
if not impo&s;&s;ible, to go down into it; be&s;ides,
the &s;moke is very incommodious, and, in
many places, the &s;urface is &s;o &s;oft, there have
been in&s;tances of people &s;inking down in it,
and paying for their temerity with their lives.
Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth
of the volcano. . . . When we arrived at the
foot of the cone, we ob&s;erved &s;ome rocks of
an incredible &s;ize, that have been di&s;charged
from the crater. The large&s;t that has been
ob&s;erved from Ve&s;uvius, is a round one of a|bout
twelve feet in diameter. The&s;e are much
greater; indeed almo&s;t in proportion of the
mountains to each other.'</P>
<P>As all that region from the top of Aetna, to
the di&s;tance of two leagues below, pre&s;ents an e|qual
&s;urface, without hills or valleys, and as the
ruins of Empedocles the philo&s;opher's tower,
who lived four hundred years before the Chri|&s;tian
aera, are &s;till to be &s;een, it is probable, that,
during all this period, the great crater has made
few or no eruptions. Hence the force of the
fire has dimini&s;hed, as it no longer acts with vio|lence
at the &s;ummit, and as all the modern e|ruptions
have happened in the lower regions of
the mountain. However, within the&s;e few cen|turies,
the dimen&s;ions of the great crater have
been often changed, as appears from the mea|&s;urements
of Sicilian authors at different periods.
<PB N="156" REF="163">
Sometimes it falls down, and is again gradually
elevated till it falls afre&s;h. The fir&s;t of the&s;e
fallings, which are well atte&s;ted, happened in the
year 1157, a &s;econd in 1329, a third in 1444,
and the la&s;t in 1669. But, from the&s;e facts we
&s;hould not conclude, as Mr Brydone has done,
that the crater will &s;oon &s;uffer another overthrow.
The notion, that this effect &s;hould be produced
every hundred years, &s;eems to have no founda|tion.
I &s;hould rather imagine, that, as the fire
no longer acts with violence at the &s;ummit, its
force has dimini&s;hed, and will continue to di|mini&s;h,
in proportion as the &s;ea retires: It has
already retired &s;everal miles by the action of the
volcano, which has formed large banks and bul|warks
by va&s;t torrents of lava. Be&s;ides, we
know, from the dimini&s;hed rapidity of Scylla
and Charybdis, and &s;everal other indications, that
the Sicilian &s;ea has &s;unk con&s;iderably within
the&s;e two thou&s;and five hundred years. We may,
therefore, conclude that this &s;ea will continue to
&s;ink, and, of cour&s;e, that the action of the
neighbouring volcano's will not relax; &s;o that
the crater of Aetna may remain during a long
time in its pre&s;ent &s;tate; and, if ever it falls
back into the gulf, it will probably be for the
la&s;t time. I farther pre&s;ume, that Aetna ought
to be regarded as one of the primitive moun|tains,
on account of its height and the immen|&s;ity
of its &s;ize, and that it began to act at the re|mote
<PB N="157" REF="164">
period when the waters fir&s;t retreated.
Its action, however, cea&s;ed after this retreat, and
was not renewed till that modern period when
the Mediterranean &s;ea, being elevated by the
rupture of the Bo&s;phorus and the Straits of
Gibraltar, deluged the land between Sicily and
Italy, and approached to the ba&s;is of Aetna. Per|haps
the fir&s;t of the&s;e eruptions is &s;till po&s;terior
to this epoch of Nature. 'It is evident,' Mr
Brydone remarks, 'that Aetna did not burn in
the days of Homer, nor for a long time before,
otherwi&s;e it would have been impo&s;&s;ible that
this poet &s;hould have talked &s;o much of Sicily,
without mentioning an object &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing.'
This remark of Mr Brydone is extremely ju&s;t;
and, of cour&s;e, the fir&s;t known eruptions of Aetna
&s;hould be dated after the age of Homer. But
we perceive, from the poetical allu&s;ions of Pin|dar
and Virgil, and from the de&s;criptions of an|cient
and modern authors, that, in the &s;pace of
eighteen or nineteen centuries, the whole face
of this mountain and of the adjacent country
has been changed by earthquakes, eruptions, tor|rents
of lava, and the formation of hills and
gulfs by the&s;e commotions. For the facts above
related I am indebted to Mr Brydone's excellent
performance; and I have too high an e&s;teem
for Mr Brydone to believe that he can be offen|ded,
becau&s;e I do not agree with him as to the
force of volcano's, and &s;ome other conclu&s;ions
<PB N="158" REF="165">
he has drawn from the&s;e facts. No preceding
author has ob&s;erved with equal acutene&s;s, or
pre&s;ented &s;uch lively pictures of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">jects he
&s;urveyed; the whole republic of letters, there|fore,
ought to unite in celebrating a work &s;o de|&s;erving
of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Torrents of gla&s;s in fu&s;ion, which have re|ceived
the denomination of lavas, are not the fir&s;t
effects of eruptions. The&s;e eruptions are com|monly
announced by an earthquake more or le&s;s
violent, which is the fir&s;t effort of the &s;ubterra|neous
fire to e&s;cape from the bowels of the earth:
It &s;oon, however, opens a pa&s;&s;age, which it en|larges
by projecting rocks and every other ob|&s;truction
to its motion. The&s;e materials, which
are exploded to a great height, fall back upon
each other, and form an eminence more or le&s;s
con&s;iderable in proportion to the duration and
violence of the eruption. As all the rejected
matters are penetrated by fire, and mo&s;t of them
converted into burning a&s;hes, the eminence to
which they give ri&s;e is a mountain of &s;olid fire,
in which a great part of the matter is melted by
the fervency of the heat. This melted matter
&s;oon begins to run, and generally flows to the
foot of the new mountain by which it was pro|duced.
But, in &s;mall volcano's, which have not
force &s;ufficient to throw the ejected matters to a
great di&s;tance, the lava i&s;&s;ues from the top of the
mountain. This effect is con&s;picuous in the e|ruptions
<PB N="159" REF="166">
of Ve&s;uvius. The lava ri&s;es in the
centre of the crater. The volcano fir&s;t throws
out &s;tones and a&s;hes, which fall perpendicularly
back into the old crater and augments its &s;ize.
It is through this additional matter, which has
fallen back, that the lava opens a pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e
two effects, though different in appearance, are
neverthele&s;s the &s;ame; for, in a &s;mall volcano,
which, like Ve&s;uvius, has not force enough to
give birth to new mountains by projecting its
materials to a di&s;tance, the whole fall back upon
the &s;ummit and increa&s;e its height; and it is at
the foot of this new crown of matter that the
lava forces its way and flows down the moun|tain.
This la&s;t effort is generally &s;ucceeded by
a repo&s;e of the volcano. The &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the
earth within, and the projections without, cea&s;e
as &s;oon as the lava flows. But the torrents of
this gla&s;s in fu&s;ion produce effects &s;till more ex|ten&s;ive
and di&s;a&s;trous than the convul&s;ions of the
mountain during an eruption. The&s;e rivers of
fire ravage, de&s;troy, and disfigure the &s;urface of
the earth. Nothing can oppo&s;e their dreadful
progre&s;s. Of this the unfortunate inhabitants
of Catania have had fatal experience. As their
city had often been de&s;troyed, either wholly or
in part, by the&s;e torrents of lava, they built very
&s;trong walls of fifty-five feet in height. Sur|rounded
by the&s;e ramparts, they believe them|&s;elves
to be &s;afe. The walls, it is true, re&s;i&s;ted the
<PB N="160" REF="167">
heat and the weight of the torrent. But this
re&s;i&s;tance &s;erved only to dam up the lava, which
ro&s;e above the ramparts, fell back upon the city,
and ravaged ever thing in its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e torrents of lava are often half a league,
and &s;ometimes even two leagues broad.</P>
<P>'The la&s;t lava we cro&s;&s;ed before our arrival at
Catania, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t extent. I thought we never
&s;hould have done with it; it certainly is not
le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even miles broad, and appears
in many places to be of an enormous depth.'</P>
<P>'When we came near the &s;ea, I was de&s;irous
to &s;ee what form it had a&s;&s;umed in meeting
with the water. I went to examine it, and
found it had driven back the waves for upwards
of a mile, and had formed a large black high
promontory, where before it was deep water.
This lava, I imagined, from its barrenne&s;s, for
it is as yet covered with a very &s;canty &s;oil, had
run from the mountain only a few ages ago;
but was &s;urpri&s;ed to be informed by Signior
Recupero, the hi&s;toriographer of Aetna, that
this very lava is mentioned by Diodorus Sicu|lus
to have bur&s;t from Aetna in the time of
the &s;econd Punic war, when Syracu&s;e was be|&s;ieged
by the Romans. A detachment was
&s;ent from Taurominum to the relief of the be|&s;ieged.
They were &s;topped on their march
by this &s;tream of lava, which having reached
the &s;ea before their arrival at the foot of the
<PB N="161" REF="168">
mountain, had cut off their pa&s;&s;age; and obli|ged
them to return by the back of Aetna, up|wards
of 100 miles about. His authority for
this, he tells me, was taken from in&s;criptions
on Roman monuments found on this lava,
and that it was likewi&s;e well a&s;certained by
many of the old Sicilian authors. Now, as
this is about 2000 years ago, one would have
imagined, if lavas have a regular progre&s;s in
becoming fertile fields, that this mu&s;t long a|go
have become at lea&s;t arable; this however
is not the ca&s;e, and it is as yet only covered
with a very &s;canty vegetation, and incapable
of producing either corn or vines. There are
indeed pretty large trees growing in the cre|vices,
which are full of a rich earth; but in
all probability it will be &s;ome hundred years
yet, before there is enough of it to render this
land of any u&s;e to the proprietors.'</P>
<P>'We pa&s;&s;ed the river Alcantara on our way
to Piedmonte, over a large bridge built entire|ly
of lava; and near to this the bed of the ri|ver
is continued for a great way, through
one of the mo&s;t remarkable, and probably one
of the mo&s;t ancient lavas that ever run from
Aetna. In many places the current of the river,
which is extremely rapid, has worn down the
&s;olid lava to the depth of 50 or 60 feet. Re|cupero,
the gentleman I have mentioned, who
is engaged in writing the natural hi&s;tory of
<PB N="162" REF="169">
Aetna, tells me, he had examined this lava
with great attention, and he thinks that its
cour&s;e, including all its windings, is not le&s;s
than 40 miles. It i&s;&s;ued from a mountain on
the north &s;ide of Aetna, and finding &s;ome val|leys
that lay to the ea&s;t, it took its cour&s;e that
way, interrupting the Alcantara in many
places, and at la&s;t arrived at the &s;ea not far
from the mouth of that river.'</P>
<P>'The city of Jaci or Aci, and indeed all the
towns on this coa&s;t, are founded on immen&s;e
rocks of lava, heaped one above another, in
&s;ome places to an amazing height; for it ap|pears
that the&s;e flaming torrents, as &s;oon as
they arrived at the &s;ea, were hardened into
rock, which not yielding any longer to the
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ure of the liquid fire behind, the melted
matter continuing to accumulate, formed a
dam of fire, which, in a &s;hort time, run over
the &s;olid front, pouring a &s;econd torrent into
the ocean: T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is was immediately con&s;olidated,
and &s;ucceeded by a third, and &s;o on. . . . The
road from Jaci to this city is entirely over la|va,
and con&s;equently very fatiguing and
trouble&s;ome. Within a few miles of that
place, we counted eight mountains formed by
eruptions, with every one its crater, from
whence t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e burnt matter was di&s;charged. Some
of the&s;e are very high, and of a great compa&s;s.
It appears evidently, that the eruptions of
<PB N="163" REF="170">
Mount Aetna have formed the whole of this
coa&s;t, and in many places have driven back
the &s;ea for &s;everal miles from its ancient boun|dary. . .
At Catania, near to a vault, which is
now thirty feet below ground, and has pro|bably
been a burial place, there is a draw-well,
where there are &s;everal &s;trata of lavas, with
earth to a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s over the &s;ur|face
of each &s;tratum. Recupero has made u&s;e
of this as an argument to prove the great an|tiquity
of the eruptions of his mountain. For
if it requires two thou&s;and years or upwards
to form but a &s;canty &s;oil on the &s;urface of a
lava, there mu&s;t have been more than that
&s;pace of time betwixt each of the eruptions
which have formed the&s;e &s;trata. But what
&s;hall we &s;ay of a pit they &s;unk near to Jaci, of
a great depth? They pierced through &s;even
di&s;tinct lavas one under the other, the &s;urfaces
of which were parallel, and mo&s;t of them co|vered
with a thick bed of rich earth. Now,
&s;ays he, the eruption which formed the lowe&s;t
of the&s;e lavas, if we may be allowed to rea&s;on
from analogy, mu&s;t have flowed from the
mountain at lea&s;t 14,000 years ago. . . .'</P>
<P>'The great eruption of 1669, after &s;haking
the whole country around for four months,
and forming a very large mountain of &s;tones
and a&s;hes, bur&s;t out about a mile above Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe|lieri,
and de&s;cending like a torrent, bore directly
<PB N="164" REF="171">
again&s;t the middle of that mountain, and (they
pretend) perforated it from &s;ide to &s;ide: This
however I doubt, as it mu&s;t have broken the
regular form of the mountain, which is not
the ca&s;e. But certain it is, that it pierced it
to a greath depth. The lava then divided in|to
two branches; and &s;urrounding this moun|tain,
joined again on its &s;outh &s;ide; and lay|ing
wa&s;te the whole country betwixt that and
Catania, &s;caled the walls of that city, and
poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In
its way, it is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of near 30,000 people, and reduced them
to beggary. It formed &s;everal hills where
there were formerly valleys, and filled up a
large lake, of which there is not now the lea&s;t
ve&s;tige to be &s;een. . . . There is no part of the
coa&s;t from Catania to Syracu&s;e nearer than
thirty miles to its &s;ummit; and yet there has
hardly been any great eruption, where the
lava has not reached the &s;ea, and driven back
its waters to a great di&s;tance, leaving high
rocks and promontories, that for ever &s;et its
waves at defiance, and pre&s;cribe their utmo&s;t
limits. What a tremendous &s;cene mu&s;t the

Here we have a territory of about 300 &s;uper|ficial

to have had two different ages: The fir&s;t very
ancient, when the &s;ummit of Aetna began to act,
and when the univer&s;al ocean left this &s;ummit
dry, and &s;unk &s;ome hundreds of fathoms below:
It was at this period that the fir&s;t eruptions hap|pened,
which produced lava at the &s;ummit, and
gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e hills found below in the re|gion
of fore&s;ts; but afterwards, the waters con|tinuing
to &s;ink, they totally abandoned this
mountain, as well as all the territories of Sicily
and the adjacent continents. After this total
retreat of the waters, the Mediterranean was
only a lake of a moderate extent, and its wa|ters
were very di&s;tant from Sicily, and all the
countries who&s;e coa&s;ts it now wa&s;hes. During
all this time, which la&s;ted &s;everal thou&s;and
years, Sicily was perfectly tranquil: Aetna, and
the other ancient volcano's which &s;urround its
&s;ummit, had cea&s;ed to act; and it was not till af|ter

the waters of the ocean and of the Black &s;ea,
<HI>i. e.</HI> after the rupture of the &s;traits of Gibraltar

the ba&s;es of the new mountains of Aetna, and
produced tho&s;e modern eruptions which have
happened &s;ince the age of Pindar to the pre&s;ent
<PB N="168" REF="175">
time; for this poet is the fir&s;t author who has
taken notice of eruptions of volcano's in Sicily.
Ve&s;uvius was preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation:
It was long one of the extingui&s;hed volcano's of
Italy, which are very numerous; and their e|ruptions
were not renewed till after the waters
of the Mediterranean were increa&s;ed and reach|ed
the ba&s;es of the&s;e inflammable mountains.
The memory of the fir&s;t eruptions, and even of
all tho&s;e which preceded the age of Pliny, was
entirely obliterated. Neither &s;hould this circum|&s;tance
excite &s;urpri&s;e; for ten thou&s;and years
have, perhaps, elap&s;ed &s;ince the general retreat
of the waters to the augmentation of the Medi|terranean,
and an equal portion of time from the
fir&s;t eruption of Veluvius till their removal.

fires cannot act with violence, unle&s;s
when they are &s;o near the &s;ea as to receive a
&s;hock from a great body of water. This rea|&s;oning
is confirmed by other phaenomena: Vol|cano's
&s;ometimes throw out great quantities of
water, and likewi&s;e torrents of bitumen. P. de la
Torr&eacute;, an able philo&s;opher, relates, that, on the
10th of March 1755, an immen&s;e torrent of water
i&s;&s;ued from the foot of the mountain, which de|luged
the neighbouring country. This torrent
brought down &s;uch a quantity of &s;and, that it
covered an exten&s;ive plain. The&s;e waters were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ery hot. The &s;tones and &s;and left on the plain

another of inflamed matter, which proceeded

<P>The &s;ame eruption, 1755, was preceded,
&s;ays M. D'Arthenay, by an inflammation &s;o
great, that it illuminated more than twenty-four
miles of country along the coa&s;ts of Catania. The
explo&s;ions were &s;oon &s;o frequent, that, on the
3d of March, we perceived a new mountain in
the top of the old &s;ummit, in the &s;ame manner
as lately happened to Ve&s;uvius. La&s;tly, the
magi&s;trates of Ma&s;cali informed us, that, on the
9th of the &s;ame month, the explo&s;ions were
terrible; that the whole &s;ky was darkened with
&s;moke; that, on the approach of night, it be|gan
to rain a deluge of &s;mall &s;tones, &s;ome of
which weighed three ounces, and covered all
the adjacent cantons; that this tremendous rain
continued an hour and quarter, and was &s;uc|ceeded
by another of black a&s;hes, which la&s;ted
the whole night; that next day, about eight
o'clock in the morning, the &s;ummit of Aetna
threw out a river of water, which, for magni|tude,
might be compared to the Nile; that the
mo&s;t ancient and rugged mountains of lava
were in an in&s;tant converted by this torrent in|to
a va&s;t plain of &s;and; that the water, which
<PB N="170" REF="177">
fortunately ran not above half a quarter of an

from the &s;ame mouth a &s;mall rivulet of fire,
which flowed during twenty-four hours; that,
on the 11th, about a mile below this mouth, a
rent happened through which i&s;&s;ued a &s;tream
of lava, of about a hundred fathoms broad by
two miles in length, and that it continued its
cour&s;e through the country the &s;ame day in
which M. D'Arthenay wrote this relation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. des Savans &eacute;trangers, imprim&eacute;s comme &s;uite des mem. de l'acad. des &s;ciences, tom. 4. p. 147.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us attend to what Mr Brydon has re|marked
concerning this eruption. 'Part of the
fine fore&s;ts which compo&s;e the &s;econd region
of Aetna was de&s;troyed by a very &s;ingular e|vent,
not later than the year 1755. During
an eruption of the volcano, an immen&s;e tor|rent
of boiling water i&s;&s;ued, as is imagined,
from the great crater of the mountain, and in
an in&s;tant poured down to its ba&s;e; over|whelming
and ruining every thing it met with
in its cour&s;e. Our conductors &s;hewed us the
traces of this torrent, which are &s;till very vi&s;ible;
but are now beginning to recover verdure and
vegetation, which for &s;ome time appeared to
have been lo&s;t. The track it has left &s;eems
<PB N="171" REF="178">
to be about a mile and a half broad; and in
&s;ome places &s;till more.'</P>
<P>'The common opinion, I find, is, that this
water was rai&s;ed by the power of &s;uction,
through &s;ome communication betwixt the vol|cano
and the &s;ea; the ab&s;urdity of which is
too glaring to need a refutation. The power
of &s;uction alone, even &s;uppo&s;ing a perfect va|cuum,
could never rai&s;e water to more than
thirty-three or thirty-four feet, which is e|qual
to the weight of a column of air the whole
height of the atmo&s;phere.'</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that Mr Brydone &s;eems
to have deceived him&s;elf; for he confounds the
force ari&s;ing from the weight of the atmo&s;phere
with the force of &s;uction produced by the ac|tion
of fire. The force of the air, when a va|cuum
is made, is indeed limited to thirty-four
feet. But the force of &s;uction by fire has no
limits: It is always proportioned to the quan|tity
and inten&s;ity of the heat by which it is
produced, as is evident from the common ef|fects
of bla&s;t furnaces. Hence the opinion of
the <HI>enlightened people of the country,</HI> in&s;tead of
being ab&s;urd, &s;eems to be well founded. It is
nece&s;&s;ary that the cavities of volcano's &s;hould
communicate with the &s;ea: Without this com|munication,
&s;uch immen&s;e torrents of water
could not be thrown out, nor indeed could any
eruption ever happen; for no power, except
<PB N="172" REF="179">
the &s;hock produced by the mingling of fire and
water, could give ri&s;e to &s;uch violent effects.</P>
<P>The volcano of Pacayita, called the <HI>water vol|cano</HI>
by the Spaniards, in all its eruptions,
throws out torrents of water. The la&s;t erup|tion,
in the year 1773, de&s;troyed the city of
Guatimala, and the torrents of water and lava
de&s;cended to the South Sea.</P>
<P>With regard to Ve&s;uvius, it has been remark|ed,
that a wind, which blows from the &s;ea, pe|netrates
into the mountain. The noi&s;e it makes
in certain cavities is heard, as if &s;ome torrent
pa&s;&s;ed below: This noi&s;e cea&s;es whenever the
land winds blow, and, at the &s;ame time, the
exhalations from the mouth of Ve&s;uvius be|come
le&s;s con&s;iderable. But, when the wind
blows from the &s;ea, this noi&s;e which re&s;embles
that of a torrent, recommences, and the exha|lations
of flame and &s;moke increa&s;e. The wa|ter
of the &s;ea, by thus in&s;inuating it&s;elf into the
mountain, &s;ometimes in greater, and &s;ometimes
in &s;maller quantities, is the rea&s;on why this vol|cano
has often thrown out both a&s;hes and wa|ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. hi&s;torique et philo&s;. de Ve&s;uve, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Mecatti; <HI>journal &eacute;tranger, mois Oct.</HI> 1754.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The learned M. D'Arthenay, who has com|pared
the modern with the ancient &s;tate of Ve|&s;uvius,
relates, that, during the interval which
preceded the eruption 1631, the funnel or cra|ter
<PB N="173" REF="180">
of the mountain was covered with trees and
verdure; that the &s;mall plain which bounds it
produced excellent pa&s;ture; that, in departing
from the &s;uperior margin of the crater, we have
a mile to de&s;cend before we arrive at this plain,
in the middle of which was another gulf. We
de&s;cended this gulf about a mile, by narrow
and winding roads of an equal dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ivity, which
led into a va&s;t &s;pace &s;urrounded with caverns,
from whence there i&s;&s;ued <HI>winds &s;o impetuous
and &s;o cold, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to endure them.</HI>
According to the &s;ame ob&s;erver, the &s;ummit of
Ve&s;uvius was then five miles in circumference.
We &s;hould not, therefore, be &s;urpri&s;ed, that
&s;ome philo&s;ophers have maintained that what
&s;eems now to be two mountains, was formerly
one; that the volcano was in the center, but
that the &s;outh &s;ide, having fallen by the force
of &s;ome eruption, produced the valley which
&s;eparates Ve&s;uvius from Mount <HI>Somma</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;erv. &s;ur le Ve&s;uve, par M. d'Arthenay; <HI>Journal de Savans &eacute;trangers, tom.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 147.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Steller remarks, that the volcano's in the
north of A&s;ia are almo&s;t always <HI>i&s;olated</HI>; that they
have nearly the &s;ame &s;urface; and that there are
always lakes on the &s;ummits, and hot waters at
the foot of tho&s;e mountains who&s;e volcano's are
extinct. This, he adds, is a farther proof of
the corre&s;pondence e&s;tabli&s;hed by Nature be|tween
the &s;ea, mountains, volcano's, and hot
<PB N="174" REF="181">
waters. We find many &s;prings of hot water in
different parts of Kamt&s;chatka<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, tom. 19. p. 238.</NOTE>. In the i&s;land
of Sjanw, forty leagues di&s;tant from Ternate,
there is a volcano, which often throws out wa|ter,
a&s;hes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 17. p. 54.</NOTE>, &amp;c. But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to ac|cumulate
more facts to prove the communica|tion
of volcano's with the &s;ea. The violence
of their eruptions would be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify
the pre&s;umption; and the general fact, that all
acting volcano's are &s;ituated near the &s;ea, com|pletes
the demon&s;tration. However, as &s;ome
philo&s;ophers have denied the reality and even
the po&s;&s;ibility of this communication of volca|no's
with the &s;ea, I &s;hall mention another fact
related by M. de la Condamine, a man equally
enlightened as worthy of credit. 'On the 14th
of June 1755,' he remarks, 'I mounted to
the &s;ummit of Ve&s;uvius, and even to the brink
of the funnel formed round the mouth of the
volcano by its la&s;t explo&s;ion; and I perceived
in the gulf, about forty fathoms deep, a
great cavity re&s;embling a vault toward the
north of the mountain. I threw down large
&s;tones into this cavity, and counted twelve
&s;econds before the noi&s;e of their rolling cea|&s;ed.
At the end of their fall I heard a noi&s;e
&s;imilar to that of a &s;tone falling into a mire;
and, when nothing was thrown in, I heard a
<PB N="175" REF="182">
noi&s;e like that of agitated waves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage en Italie, par. M. de la Condamine; <HI>Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e</HI> 1757, <HI>p.</HI> 371.</NOTE>.' If the
fall of the &s;tones had been perpendicular, and
met with no ob&s;tacle, twelve &s;econds would
have given a depth of 2160 feet, and the bot|tom
of the gulf would, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, be
deeper than the level of the &s;ea; for, according
to le P. de la Torr&eacute;, in 1753 this mountain
was only 1677 feet above the &s;urface of the &s;ea,
and this elevation has been dimini&s;hed &s;ince
that period. Hence we may conclude, that the
caverns of this volcano de&s;cend below the level
of the &s;ea, and, of cour&s;e, they may have &s;ub|terraneous
communications.</P>
<P>On the 15th of July 1753, I received, from
an eye-witne&s;s, and an accurate ob&s;erver, a di|&s;tinct
detail of the then condition of Ve&s;uvius.
I &s;hall &s;ubjoin it in the words of the author, be|cau&s;e
it will tend to fix our ideas concerning
what is to be farther apprehended from the ef|fects
of this volcano, the force of which &s;eems
to be greatly dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>'Having arrived at the foot of the mountain,
which is about two leagues di&s;tant from Na|ples,
we mounted during an hour and a half
upon a&s;&s;es, and an equal portion of time was
employed in completing the journey on foot.
This is the &s;teepe&s;t and mo&s;t fatiguing part of
the way. We held by the belts of two men
<PB N="176" REF="183">
who went before, and we climbed among a&s;h|es
and &s;tones formerly exploded.'</P>
<P>'In our a&s;cent, we &s;aw the lavas of different
eruptions. The mo&s;t ancient, who&s;e age is
uncertain, but tradition a&s;&s;igns it two hundred
years, is of an iron-gray colour, and has all
the appearance of a &s;tone: It is u&s;ed for pa|ving
the &s;treets of Naples, and in other works
of ma&s;onry. We found others, which were
&s;aid to be &s;ixty, forty, and twenty years old.
The la&s;t was thrown out in the year 1752. . .
The&s;e different lavas, except the mo&s;t ancient,
when viewed at a di&s;tance, have the appear|ance
of a blacki&s;h brown rugged earth, more
or le&s;s recently laboured. When viewed near|er,
it is a matter perfectly &s;imilar to the refu&s;e
of iron founderies. It is more or le&s;s compo|&s;ed
of earth and ferruginous matter, and ap|proaches
more or le&s;s to the nature of &s;tone.'</P>
<P>'When arrived at the top, which before the
eruption was &s;olid, we find the fir&s;t ba&s;in,
who&s;e circumference is &s;aid to be two Italian
miles, and its depth appears to be about forty
feet. It is &s;urrounded with a cru&s;t of earth,
which gradually thickens toward the ba&s;e, and
its upper margin is two feet broad. The bot|tom
of this ba&s;in is covered with a greeni&s;h
yellow &s;ulphureous matter, which is hard and
warm, but does not burn; and &s;moke i&s;&s;ues
through different &s;i&s;&s;ures.'</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="184">
'In the centre of this ba&s;in, we &s;ee a &s;econd,
which is about half the circumference and half
the depth of the former. Its bottom is co|vered
with a blacki&s;h brown matter, &s;imilar to
the fre&s;he&s;t lavas we find on the road.'</P>
<P>'In the &s;econd ba&s;in, there is a &s;mall mount
which is hollow internally, open at the top,
and likewi&s;e open from the top to the ba&s;e to|ward
that &s;ide of the mountain where we a|&s;cended.
This lateral opening is about twenty
feet broad at the top, and four feet at the ba&s;e.
The height of this &s;mall mount is about forty
feet; the diameter of the ba&s;e is about as
much, and that of the opening at the top a|bout
twenty feet.'</P>
<P>'This ba&s;e ri&s;es about twenty feet above the
&s;econd ba&s;in, and forms a third ba&s;in, which
is filled with a liquid and burning matter, and
has a perfect re&s;emblance to the melted metal
in an iron furnace. This matter perpetually
boils with great violence. Its movements have
the appearance of a lake moderately agitated,
and the noi&s;e it produces is &s;imilar to that of
waves.'</P>
<P>'Every minute, quantities of this matter are
projected into the air, like water thrown up
by many jets-d'eaux. The&s;e projections pro|duce
the appearance of burning &s;heafs of
wheat, which ri&s;e to the height of thirty or
forty feet, and fall back in various curves,
<PB N="178" REF="185">
partly into their own ba&s;in, and partly
the &s;econd, which is covered with a black
matter. It is the reflected light of the&s;e
burning jets which is &s;een from Naples du|ring
the night. The noi&s;e they make in
their elevation and fall &s;eems to be compo&s;ed
of that of fire-works, and the noi&s;e produced
by the waves of the &s;ea, when violently da&s;h|ed
again&s;t a rock.'</P>
<P>'The boilings and jets produce a perpetual
evacuation of this matter. Through the aper|ture
of four feet, at the ba&s;e of the &s;mall
mount, a burning rivulet of the &s;ame dimen|&s;ions
with the aperture continually &s;lows, and
de&s;cends in an inclined canal, and with a mean
movement, into the &s;econd ba&s;in, where, after
dividing into &s;everal rills, it &s;tops and is ex|tingui&s;hed.'</P>
<P>'This burning rivulet con&s;i&s;ts of fre&s;h lava,
which runs only eight days. But, if it con|tinues
to augment, it will in time produce a
new overflowing into the plain, &s;imilar to that
which happened two years ago. The whole
is accompanied with a thick &s;moke, which has
not the odour of &s;ulphur, but preci&s;ely that
which proceeds from a furnace where tiles
are roa&s;ted.'</P>
<P>'We may, without danger, go round the
margin of the crater; becau&s;e the little hollow

are made, is &s;ufficiently di&s;tant to prevent all

volcano's extends as far as Sicily, and

<P>'It is very probable, &s;ays M. l'Abb&eacute; Mecati,

&s;eems to be a portion detached from that chain
of mountains which, under the name of <HI>A|pennines,</HI>
divides all Italy through its whole

three different mountains, one of them is Ve|&s;uvius
properly &s;o called; the other two are
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The two la&s;t
are &s;ituated toward the we&s;t, and form a kind
<PB N="183" REF="190">
of &s;emicircle round Ve&s;uvius, with which they
have a common ba&s;e.'</P>
<P>'This mountain was formerly &s;urrounded
with fertile fields, and it&s;elf covered with trees
and verdure, except the &s;ummit, which was
flat and &s;terile, and where &s;everal open ca|verns
were to be &s;een. The top was &s;urround|ed
with rocks, which rendered it of difficult
acce&s;s. The&s;e rocks were &s;o high, that they
concealed the valley between Ve&s;uvius and
Mounts Somma and Otajano. The &s;ummit
of Ve&s;uvius, which has &s;ince &s;unk con&s;idera|bly,
being then much more remarkable, it is
not &s;urpri&s;ing that the ancients believed it had
only one top. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The breadth of the valley is 2220 Paris
feet, and its length nearly the &s;ame. . . .
It inve&s;ts one half of Ve&s;uvius, and, like all
the &s;ides of the mountain, it is covered with
burnt &s;and and &s;mall pumice &s;tones. The
rocks on Mounts Somma and Otajano ex|hibit
a few herbs, and the &s;urface of the&s;e
mountains is covered with trees and verdure.
The&s;e rocks, at fir&s;t &s;ight, have the appearance
of burnt &s;tones; but, on a clo&s;er examination,
they are, like the rocks of other mountains,
compo&s;ed of &s;trata of natural &s;tones, of a
che&s;nut coloured earth, of chalk, and of white
&s;tones, which have not the &s;malle&s;t appear|ance
of having been liquified by fire. . .'</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="191">
'Round Ve&s;uvius we &s;ee openings which
have been made at different times, and through
which lavas had i&s;&s;ued. The&s;e torrents of burn|ing
matter, which &s;ometimes come from the
&s;ides, and &s;ometimes from the top of the
mountain, de&s;cend into the plains, and &s;ome|times
run as far as the &s;ea, and harden like a
&s;tone when the matter cools. . . .'</P>
<P>'On the &s;ummit of Ve&s;uvius there is only a
&s;mall margin of four or five palms wide, and
de&s;cribes a circumference of 5624 Paris feet.
Upon this margin we can walk pretty commo|diou&s;ly.
The whole of it is covered with
burnt &s;and, under which we find &s;tones part|ly
natural and partly calcined. . . . In
two elevations on this margin, we find beds
of natural &s;tones, arranged in the &s;ame man|ner
as in other mountains; which confutes
the notion of tho&s;e who regard Ve&s;uvius as a
mountain gradually rai&s;ed above the plain of
the valley. . .'</P>
<P>'The depth of the gulf where the matter
boils is about 543 feet; and the height of the
mountain above the level of the &s;ea is 1677
feet, which is one third of an Italian mile.'</P>
<P>'This height has been more con&s;iderable.
The eruptions which have changed the ex|ternal

<P>From all the&s;e examples, if we con&s;ider the
external figure of Sicily and other countries ra|vaged
by fire, we &s;hall evidently perceive that
no volcano exi&s;ts which is purely i&s;olated or

groups of volcano's. This we have already
&s;een with regard to Aetna, and &s;hall give a &s;e|cond
example of it in Hecla. A great part of
the i&s;land, like Sicily, is only a group of volca|no's,
which I &s;hall prove by the following
ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land ought be regarded as a
va&s;t mountain inter&s;per&s;ed with deep cavities,
concealing in its bowels great quantities of
minerals, vitrified and bituminous &s;ub&s;tances,
and ri&s;ing from the mid&s;t of the &s;ea in the form
of a &s;hort flattened cone. Its &s;urface pre&s;ents
to the eye nothing but tops of mountains co|vered
with &s;now and ice; and lower down we
have the picture of confu&s;ion and ruin. It
is an enormous ma&s;s of &s;tones and fragments
of rocks, which are &s;ometimes porous and half
calcined, and exhibit a hideous appearance by
their blackne&s;s and the marks of fire impre&s;&s;ed
upon them. The fi&s;&s;ures and hollows of rocks
are filled with a red, and &s;ometimes with a black

<P>Mo&s;t of Jokuts, which are mountains of a mid|dle
height, and overtopped by others of a great|er
elevation, are volcano's that occa&s;ionally
throw out flames, and produce earthquakes:
Of the&s;e there are no le&s;s than twenty in this
i&s;land. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood
of the&s;e mountains have learned by experience
and ob&s;ervation, that, when the ice and &s;now
ri&s;e to a con&s;iderable height, and &s;top the
mouths of the&s;e cavities, which formerly
di&s;charged flames, that earthquakes are about
to happen, which are always &s;ucceeded by erup|tions
of fire. It is for this rea&s;on that the Ice|landers
are at pre&s;ent afraid le&s;t the Jokuts,
which, in the year 1728, threw out flames in
the canton of Skaftfield, &s;hould &s;oon be again
inflamed; the ice and &s;now being accumulated on
their &s;ummits, and appearing to ob&s;truct tho&s;e
vents which favoured the exhalations of the
&s;ubterraneous fires.</P>
<P>In 1721, the Jokut called Ko&euml;tlegan, about
five or &s;ix leagues to the we&s;t of the &s;ea, near
the bay of Portland, broke out into flames, af|ter
&s;everal &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth. This con|flagration
melted ma&s;&s;es of ice of an enormous
thickne&s;s, and gave ri&s;e to impetuous torrents,
which deluged the country, and carried down
<PB N="187" REF="194">
to the &s;ea prodigious quantities of earth, &s;and,
and &s;tones. The &s;olid ma&s;&s;es of ice, and the
immen&s;e quantity of earth, &s;tones, and &s;and,
tran&s;ported by the inundation, &s;o loaded the
&s;ea, that, at half a mile from the coa&s;t, a &s;mall
mountain was formed, which &s;till appeared
above the &s;ea in the year 1750. We may
form &s;ome idea of the quantity of matter carri|ed
down to the &s;ea by this inundation, when
we con&s;ider that it was obliged to retreat
twelve miles beyond its former limits.</P>
<P>The inundation continued three days; and
it was not till after this period that a per&s;on
could pa&s;s on foot to the mountains. . . .</P>
<P>Hecla, which has always been regarded as
one of the mo&s;t famous volcano's in the uni|ver&s;e,
on account of its tremendous eruptions,
is now one of the lea&s;t dangerous in the i&s;land.
Mounts Ko&euml;tlegan and Krafle have recently
made as great ravages as Hecla did of old. It
has been remarked, that this la&s;t volcano has
thrown out flames ten times only in the &s;pace
of eight hundred years, namely, in the years
1104, 1157, 1222, 1300, 1341, 1362, 1389,
1558, 1636, and, la&s;tly, in the year 1693.
This eruption commenced on the 13th of
February, and continued to the month of Au|gu&s;t
following. All the other eruptions la&s;ted
a few months only. From the above dates it
appears, that Hecla made its greate&s;t ravages
<PB N="188" REF="195">
in the fourteenth century, having undergone no
le&s;s than four eruptions; that it remained per|fectly
tranquil during the 15th century; and
that it threw out no fire for one hundred and
&s;ixty years. From this period, there was one
eruption only in the &s;ixteenth, and two in the
&s;eventeenth century. We now perceive in this
volcano neither fire, nor &s;moke, nor exhalations
of any kind. We only find, in &s;ome &s;mall
hollows, as is common in many other parts of
the i&s;land, boiling water, &s;tones, &s;and, and
a&s;hes.</P>
<P>In 1726, after a few &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth,
which were felt only in the northern cantons,
Mount Krafle began to throw out, with a dread|ful
noi&s;e, &s;moke, flames, a&s;hes and &s;tones. This
eruption continued two or three years, without
doing any damage; becau&s;e the whole rejected
matter fell back upon the mountain, or round
its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1728, the fire communicated with &s;ome
mountains &s;ituated near Krafle, which burnt
during &s;everal weeks. When the minerals they
contained were melted, a river of fire ran gent|ly
toward the &s;outh into the country below the&s;e
mountains. This river threw it&s;elf into a lake
about three leagues from Mount Krafle, and,
by the &s;hock of the water, produced a horrible
noi&s;e, and clouds of vapours. The running of
the lava did not cea&s;e till 1729, when the mat|ter
<PB N="189" REF="196">
which formed it was probably exhau&s;ted.
The lake was filled with an immen&s;e quantity
of calcined &s;tones, which rai&s;ed its water con&s;i|derably.
It is about twenty leagues in circum|ference,
and &s;ituated at an equal di&s;tance from
the &s;ea. We &s;hall not take notice of the other
volcano's in this i&s;land; it is &s;ufficient that we
have mentioned the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 9. 10. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription we perceive, that the
Jokuts of Hecla greatly re&s;emble the &s;econdary
volcano's of Aetna; that, in both, the highe&s;t
&s;ummit is tranquil; that the &s;ummit of Ve&s;u|vius
is much &s;unk; and that probably tho&s;e of
Aetna and Hecla were formerly higher than they
are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Though the topography of volcano's in other
parts of the world is not &s;o well known as that
of tho&s;e in Europe, we may, neverthele&s;s, pre|&s;ume,
from analogy, and the &s;imilarity of their
effects, that they re&s;emble each other in every
re&s;pect. They are all &s;ituated in i&s;lands, or up|on
the coa&s;ts of continents. Almo&s;t the whole
of them are &s;urrounded with &s;econdary vol|cano's.
Some of them are active, and others
extingui&s;hed or quiet. The number of the lat|ter
is greater, even in the Cordelieres, which ap|pear
to be the mo&s;t ancient domain of volcano's.
In the &s;outh of A&s;ia, the i&s;lands of Sonde, the
Moluccas, and Philippines, bear evident marks of
<PB N="190" REF="197">
de&s;truction by fire, and are &s;till infe&s;ted with
volcano's. They are likewi&s;e very frequent in
the i&s;land of Japan: This country is al&s;o more
&s;ubject to earthquakes than any other part of
the globe. In many places of Japan there are
hot fountains. Mo&s;t of the Indian i&s;lands, and
all the &s;eas of the&s;e ea&s;tern regions, pre&s;ent to
our eyes nothing but peaks and detached &s;um|mits,
which vomit out fire, and deep indented
coa&s;ts, the relicks of ancient continents which
are now no more. Here the mariner often
meets with ports which daily &s;ink; and even
whole i&s;lands have been known to di&s;appear,
and to be &s;wallowed up, with their volcano's,
by the waters. The &s;eas in China are warm,
which is a proof that there is a great efferve&s;|cence
in the maritime ba&s;ins of this region.
The hurricanes are tremendous, and water|&s;pouts
are frequent. The tempe&s;ts are always
preceded by general and perceptible boilings of
the waters, and by various meteors and other
exhalations with which the atmo&s;phere is load|ed.</P>
<P>The volcano of Teneriff has been explored
by Dr Thomas Heberden, who re&s;ided &s;everal
years in the village of Oratava, which is &s;ituated
at the foot of the Peak. In his way he found
large &s;tones di&s;po&s;ed on all &s;ides at &s;everal lea|gues
from the top of the mountain. Some of
them appeared to be entire, and others &s;eemed
<PB N="191" REF="198">
to have been burnt, and thrown to this di&s;tance
by the volcano. In a&s;cending the mountain he
&s;till &s;aw burnt rocks &s;cattered about in large
ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>'We arrived,' Dr Heberden remarks, 'at
the famous grotto of Zegds, which is &s;urround|ed
on all &s;ides with enormous ma&s;&s;es of burnt
rocks. . . . .'</P>
<P>'A quarter of a league higher, we met with
a &s;andy plain, in the middle of which there is
a pyramid of &s;and, or yellowi&s;h a&s;hes, called
the <HI>Sugar Loaf.</HI> Round its ba&s;e, fuliginous
vapours perpetually ari&s;e. From thence to the
&s;ummit, the di&s;tance might be half a quarter of
a league. But the a&s;cent is too difficult, on
account of its &s;teepne&s;s and the bad footing. . .'</P>
<P>'However, we reached what is called the
<HI>Cauldron</HI> which is twelve or fifteen feet deep.
Its &s;ides taper to the bottom, and form a cavity
which re&s;embles a rever&s;ed cone. . . . Here
the ground is very warm; and, from about
twenty tubes or chimneys, a thick &s;ulphureous
vapour ari&s;es. The whole ground &s;eems to be
mixed with &s;ulphur, which gives the &s;urface
a brilliant appearance. . . . .'</P>

Hence the torrents of this vitrified matter, when
compared to torrents of water, run &s;lowly; and
yet they often proceed to great di&s;tances. In
the&s;e torrents of fire, however, there is another
movement than what takes places in tho&s;e of
water: This movement tends to elevate the
whole running ma&s;s, and is produced by the ex|pan&s;ive
force of the heat in the interior parts of
the burning torrent. The external &s;urface cools
fir&s;t; the liquid fire continues to run below;
and, as heat acts equally on all &s;ides, the fire,
which endcavours to e&s;cape, elevates the &s;uperior
parts that are already con&s;olidated, and often
forces them to ri&s;e perpendicularly. This is the
origin of tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es of lava in the form
of rocks, which are found in the cour&s;e of al|mo&s;t

are formed by the perpendicular fall of

and humidity of the water arre&s;t the burning
matter, and con&s;olidate its &s;urfaces the moment
it falls; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bundles or ma&s;&s;es of

heat of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es tends to dilate them,
a reciprocal re&s;i&s;tance is created; and the &s;ame
effect is produced as happens in the &s;welling of

Each of the&s;e grains would a&s;&s;ume a hexagonal

and, when the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;urrounding
bundles is &s;tronger than the dilatation of the
bundle &s;urrounded, in&s;tead of becoming hexa|gonal,
it has only three, four, or five &s;ides.
But, if the dilatation of the &s;urrounded bundle
is &s;tronger than the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;urrounding

Hence, if there are intervals in the fall of the
matter, the &s;uperior &s;urface of the forming co|lumn
being partly con&s;olidated, is hollowed
by the weight of the &s;ucceeding ma&s;s, which
then moulds it&s;elf into a convex form in the con|cavity

In the &s;ame manner, when, by an explo&s;ion,
&s;ome detached ma&s;&s;es are darted from the torrent

The ancient ramparts of ba&s;alt found
in the interior parts of continents, &s;how that the

a month, will be requi&s;ite before the &s;urface of

<HEAD>ADDITIONS to the Article, Of Caverns,

<HEAD>Of Caverns formed by the Primitive Fire.</HEAD>
<P>IN my theory of the Earth, I mentioned on|ly
two kinds of caverns, the one produced
by the fire of volcano's, and the other by the
motion of &s;ubterraneous waters. Tho&s;e two
&s;pecies of caverns are not &s;ituated at great depths.
They are even new, when compared with tho&s;e
va&s;t cavities, which were formed at the time the
globe fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed a &s;olid form; for, at this pe|riod,
all the &s;uper&s;icial eminences and hollows,
and all the cavities in the interior parts of the
earth, e&s;pecially near the &s;urface, were produced.
Several of tho&s;e caverns produced by the primi|tive
&s;ire, after being &s;upported for &s;ome time,
have afterwards &s;plit by cooling, which dimini&s;h|es
the volume of every kind of matter; the&s;e
would &s;oon fall in, and, by their &s;inking, form
ba&s;ins or re&s;ervoirs for the &s;ea, into which the
waters, formerly much elevated above this level,
ran, and abandoned the lands which they origi|nally
<PB N="223" REF="230">
covered. It is more than probable, that
a certain number of the&s;e ancient caverns &s;till
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in the interior parts of the globe, and by
their &s;inking may produce &s;imilar effects, and
give ri&s;e to new receptacles to the waters. In
this ca&s;e, they will partly abandon the ba&s;in
which they now occupy, and run, by their na|tural
propen&s;ity, into the&s;e lower places. For
example, we find beds of &s;ea &s;hells in the Pyren|nees
1500 fathoms above the pre&s;ent level of
the ocean. Hence it is certain, that the waters,
when the&s;e &s;hells were formed, ro&s;e 1500 fa|thoms
higher than they do at pre&s;ent. But,
when the caverns, which &s;upported the lands
that are now the bed of the Atlantic ocean,
&s;unk, the waters which covered the Pyrennees
and the whole of Europe would run with rapi|dity
into the&s;e re&s;ervoirs, and, of cour&s;e, leave
uncovered all the lands in this part of the world.
The &s;ame revolution would extend to every o|ther
country. The waters appear to have ne|ver
reached the &s;ummits of the highe&s;t moun|tains;
becau&s;e they exhibit no relicks of marine
productions, and no &s;ufficient marks of a long
abode of the waters. However, as &s;ome of the
matters of which they are compo&s;ed, though all
of the vitre&s;cent kind, &s;eem to have derived
their &s;olidity and con&s;i&s;tence from the interven|tion
and cement of water, and as they appear
to have been formed, as already remarked, in
<PB N="224" REF="231">
the ma&s;&s;es of &s;and, or gla&s;s du&s;t, which former|ly
lay on the peaks of mountains, but which,
in the progre&s;s of time, have been carried down
to their bottoms by the rains, we cannot pro|nounce
po&s;itively, that the waters of the &s;ea ne|ver
&s;tood higher than the places where &s;hells are
now found: The waters have perhaps &s;tood
much higher, even before their temperature
permitted the exi&s;tence of &s;hells. The greate&s;t
height reached by the univer&s;al ocean is to us un|known.
But we know that the waters were ele|vated
from 1500 or 2000 fathoms above their
pre&s;ent level; &s;ince &s;hells are found in the
Pyrennees at 1500 hundred fathoms, and in the
Cordelieres at 2000.</P>
<P>If all the peaks of mountains were formed of
&s;olid gla&s;s, or of other matters immediately pro|duced
by fire, it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to have
recour&s;e to the abode of the waters, or to any
other cau&s;e, in order to conceive how they a&s;|&s;umed
their con&s;i&s;tence. But mo&s;t peaks of
mountains &s;eem to be compo&s;ed of matters,
which, though vitrifiable, have acquired their &s;o|lidity
by the intervention of water. We cannot,
therefore, determine whether their con&s;i&s;tence
is &s;olely owing to the primitive fire, or whe|ther
the intervention and cement of water were
not requi&s;ite to complete the operation of fire, and
to be&s;tow on the&s;e vitrifiable ma&s;&s;es the qualities
which they po&s;&s;e&s;s. Be&s;ides, this &s;uppo&s;ition
<PB N="225" REF="232">
prevents not the primitive fire, which at fir&s;t
produced the greate&s;t inequalities on the globe,
from being the chief cau&s;e of tho&s;e chains of
mountains that traver&s;e its &s;urface, and particu|larly
of their cores or nuclei; but the contours
of the&s;e &s;ame mountains have perhaps been di&s;|po&s;ed
and fa&s;hioned by the waters at a &s;ub&s;e|quent
period; for it is upon the&s;e contours, and
at certain heights, that &s;hells and other produc|tions
of the &s;ea are found.</P>
<P>To acquire a clear notion of the ancient ca|verns
formed by the primitive fire, we mu&s;t
&s;uppo&s;e the globe to be deprived of all its wa|ters,
and of all the matters which cover its &s;ur|face,
to the depth of ten or twelve hundred
feet. By removing in idea this external bed of
earth and water, the globe will pre&s;ent to us the
form it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed about the time of its fir&s;t con|&s;olidation.
The whole ma&s;s was compo&s;ed of
vitreous rock, or, if you will, of melted gla&s;s;
and this matter, in cooling and acquiring con|&s;i&s;tence,
produced, like all other melted bodies,
eminences, depre&s;&s;ions, and cavities, upon the
whole &s;urface of the globe. The&s;e internal ca|vities
formed by fire, are the primitive caverns,
and they are more numerous in the &s;outhern
than in the northern regions; becau&s;e the rota|tory
motion, which elevated the equatorial re|gions
before con&s;olidation, likewi&s;e produced
the greate&s;t derangement of the matter, and, by
<PB N="226" REF="233">
retarding the con&s;olidation, would concur with
the action of the fire in giving ri&s;e to a greater
number of inequalities in this than in any other
part of the globe. The waters coming from
the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es could not approach tho&s;e burning re|gions
before they cooled. The vaults which
&s;upported the&s;e regions having &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fal|len
in, the &s;urface &s;unk and broke in a thou&s;and
places. For this rea&s;on, the greate&s;t inequali|tie
of the globe are found in the equatorial re|gions:
There the primitive caverns are more
numerous than in any other part of the earth.
They are likewi&s;e more profound, <HI>i. e.</HI> perhaps
five or &s;ix leagues deep; becau&s;e the matter of
the globe, while in a liquid &s;tate, was agitated
to that depth by the motion of rotation. But
all the caverns in high mountains derive not
their origin from the operation of primitive fire.
Tho&s;e alone which are deeply &s;ituated below the
mountains can be a&s;cribed to this cau&s;e. The
more exterior and more elevated have been form|ed,
as already remarked, by the operation of
&s;econdary cau&s;es. Hence the globe, deprived
of its waters and the matters tran&s;ported by
them, would pre&s;ent to us a &s;urface much more
irregular than it appears with the aid of this co|vering.
The great chains of mountains and
their peaks and ridges, have not now the ap|pearance
of half of their real height. The
whole are att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ed by their ba&s;es to a vitrifiable

rock, and are of the &s;ame nature. Thus we
&s;hould reckon three &s;pecies of caverns produced
by Nature: The fir&s;t by the force of the primi|tive
fire; the &s;econd by the action of water;
and the third by that of &s;ubterraneous fires:
Each of the&s;e caverns, though different in their
origin, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by examining the
matters they contain, or by which they are &s;ur|rounded.</P>

the great revolutions which happen in the earth;
but they are often produced by &s;maller cau&s;es.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="5 letters">ation of the water, by diluting the clay,
upon which almo&s;t all calcarious mountains re&s;t,
has frequently made tho&s;e mountains incline

&s;hall &s;ubjoin &s;ome examples.</P>
<P>'In the year 1757,' &s;ays M. Perronet, 'a part
of the ground &s;ituated about half-way before
we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rive at the Ca&s;tle of Croix-fontaine, o|pened
in many places, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively tum|bled
down. The terrace wall, which inclo&s;ed
this ground, was overturned, and the road,
which was formerly at the foot of the wall,
was obliged to be carried to a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance.
<PB N="229" REF="236">
. . . . This ground re&s;ted upon a ba&s;e
of inclined earth.' This learned and chief
engineer of our highways and bridges mentions
another accident of the &s;ame kind which happen|ed,
in the year 1733, at Pardines, near I&s;&s;oire in
Auvergne. The ground, for about 400 fa|thoms
in length by 300 in breadth, de&s;cend|ed
upon a pretty di&s;tant meadow, with all its
hou&s;es, trees, and herbage. He adds, that con|&s;iderable
portions of ground are &s;ometimes tran&s;|ported
either by the rupture of re&s;ervoirs of wa|ter,
or by the &s;udden melting of &s;nows. In
1757, at the village of Guet, about ten leagues
from Grenoble, on the road to Brian&ccedil;on, the
whole ground, which lies on a declivity,
&s;lipt and de&s;cended in an in&s;tant towards Drac,
which is about a mile di&s;tant. The earth &s;plit
in the village, and the part which moved off
was &s;ix, eight, and nine feet lower than its
former &s;tation. This ground was &s;ituated on a
pretty &s;olid rock, which was inclined to the
horizon about forty degrees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1769, p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the&s;e examples I &s;hall add another fact, of
which I have been a con&s;tant witne&s;s, and which
has co&s;t me a con&s;iderable expence. The de|tached
ri&s;ing ground, upon which the town and
old ca&s;tle of Montbard are &s;ituated, is elevated
140 feet above the level of the river, and its
mo&s;t rapid de&s;cent is to the north-ca&s;t. This
<PB N="230" REF="237">
ri&s;ing ground is crowned with calcarious rocks,
the &s;trata of which, when taken together, are
54 feet thick. They every where re&s;t upon a
ma&s;s of clay, which, of cour&s;e, before reaching
the level of the river, is 86 feet thick. My
garden, which is &s;urrounded with &s;everal ter|races,
is &s;ituated on the top of this ri&s;ing ground.
From twenty-five to twenty-&s;ix fathoms of the
la&s;t terrace-wall on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide, where the
declivity is greate&s;t, gave way all at once, carrying
along the inferior ground which would have
gradually de&s;cended to the level of the ground
near the river, if its progre&s;&s;ive motion had not
been prevented by taking down the whole wall.
This wall was &s;even feet thick and founded on
clay. The movement of the earth was very
&s;low: I perceived that it was evidently occa|&s;ioned
by the in&s;inuation of water. All the
water which falls upon the platform on the top
of this ri&s;ing ground, penetrates through the fi&s;|&s;ures
of the rocks, and reaches the clay upon
which they re&s;t: Of this fact we are a&s;certain|ed
by two wells dug from the top of the rock
to the clay. All the rain-water, therefore, which
falls upon this platform and the adjacent terraces,
collect upon the clay where the perpendicular
fi&s;&s;ures of the rock terminate. The water gives
ri&s;e to &s;mall rills in different places, which are
rendered &s;till more apparent by &s;everal wells dug
below the rocks. Wherever this ma&s;s of clay is
<PB N="231" REF="238">
cut by ditches, we &s;ee the water filtrating from
above. It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that walls,
however &s;olid, &s;hould &s;lip upon this fir&s;t bed of
moi&s;t clay, if they are not founded much lower,
as I have done in rebuilding them. The &s;ame
thing, however, has happened on the north|we&s;t
&s;ide, where the declivity is gentler, and no
rills of water appear. The clay had been re|moved
at the di&s;tance of twelve or fifteen feet
from a great wall, of eleven feet thick, thirty-five
feet high, and twelve fathoms long. This wall
is con&s;tructed of good materials, and has &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed
more than nine hundred years. The cut
from which the clay was removed, though not
above four or five feet deep, has produced a
movement in this immen&s;e wall. It declines
from the perpendicular about fifteen inches, and
I could only prevent its downfall by abuttments
of &s;even or eight feet thick, and founded at the
depth of fourteen feet.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts I drew the following con|clu&s;ion,
which is not &s;o intere&s;ting at pre&s;ent as
it would have been in ages that are pa&s;t, that
there is not a ca&s;tle or fortre&s;s &s;ituated upon
heights, which might not be ea&s;ily tumbled into
the plain by a &s;imple cut of ten or twelve feet
deep and &s;ome fathoms wide. This cut &s;hould
be made at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the la&s;t wall,
and upon that &s;ide where the declivity is greate&s;t.
This method, of which the ancients never
<PB N="232" REF="239">
dreamed, would have &s;aved them the operation
of battering-rams and other engines of war;
and, even at pre&s;ent, might be employed, in
many ca&s;es, with advantage. I am convinced
by my eyes, that, when the&s;e walls &s;lipt, if the
cut made for rebuilding them had not been
&s;peedily filled with &s;trong ma&s;on-work, the an|cient
walls, and the two towers that have &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed
in good condition nine hundred years, and
one of which is 125 feet high, would have tum|bled
into the valley, along with the rocks upon
which they are founded. As mo&s;t of our hills
compo&s;ed of calcarious &s;tones re&s;t upon a clay
ba&s;e, the fir&s;t &s;trata of which are always more
or le&s;s moi&s;tened with the waters that filtrate
through the crevices of the rocks, it appears to
be certain, that, by expo&s;ing the&s;e moi&s;tened beds
to the air by a cut, the whole ma&s;s of rocks and
earth re&s;ting upon the clay would &s;lip, and in a
few days tumble into the cut, e&s;pecially during
wet weather. This mode of di&s;mantling a for|tre&s;s
is more &s;imple than any hitherto invented;
and experience has convinced me that its &s;ucce&s;s
is certain.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Turf.</HEAD>
<P>TO what I have formerly remarked concern|ing
turf, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin the following facts:</P>
<P>In the juri&s;diction of Bergues-Saint-Winock,
Furnes, and Bourbourg, we find turf at three or
four feet below the &s;urface. The&s;e beds of turf
are generally two feet thick, and are compo&s;ed
of corrupted wood, of entire trees with their
branches and leaves, and particularly of filberds
which are known by their nuts, and the whole
is interlaced with reeds and the roots of plants.</P>
<P>What is the origin of the&s;e beds of turf, which
extend from Bruges through the whole flat coun|try
of Flanders as far as the river Aa, between
the downs and the high country in the environs
of Bergues? &amp;c. In remote ages, when Flan|ders
was only a va&s;t fore&s;t, a &s;udden inundation
of the &s;ea mu&s;t have deluged the whole country,
and, in retiring, depo&s;ited all the trees, wood,
and twigs, which it had eradicated and de&s;troyed
in this lowe&s;t territory of Flanders; and this e|vent
mu&s;t have happened in the month of Au|gu&s;t
or September; becau&s;e we &s;till find the leaves
of trees, as well as nuts on the filberds. This
inundation mu&s;t have taken place long before

that province was conquered by Julius Cae&s;ar,

<P>In the bowels of the earth, we &s;ometimes
find vegetables in a different &s;tate from that of
common tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f. For example, in Mount Gane|lon,

all kinds of trees, and al&s;o reeds, the whole

<P>'We di&s;tingui&s;h,' M. Guettard remarks,
two &s;pecies of turf: The one is compo&s;ed of
marine, and the other of terre&s;trial plants. We
&s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t to have been formed when
the &s;ea covered all tho&s;e parts of the earth
which are now inhabited. The &s;econd is &s;up|po&s;ed
to have been &s;uperinduced upon the for|mer.
According to this &s;y&s;tem, it is imagined
<PB N="235" REF="242">
that the currents carried the &s;ea-plants into the
hollows formed by the mountains, which were
elevated above the waters, and, after being
to&s;&s;ed about by the waves, were depo&s;ited in
the hollows.'</P>
<P>'This origin of turf is not impo&s;&s;ible: The
great quantity of &s;ea-plants is &s;ufficient to ac|count
for the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aenomenon. The Dutch e|ven
alledge, that the goodne&s;s of their turf is
owing to the bitumen with which the &s;ea-water
is impregnated, and that they were form|ed
by &s;ea-weeds. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The turf-pits of Villeroy are &s;ituated in the
valley through which the river E&s;&s;one runs;
and part of this valley extends from Roi&s;&s;y to
E&s;charcon. . . . . It is even near Roi&s;&s;y that
turfs were fir&s;t dug. . . . . But tho&s;e near
E&s;charcon are the be&s;t. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The meadows where turf is dug are open
and bad: They are filled with ru&s;hes, hor&s;e-tail,
and other plants which grow in bad &s;oils.
The&s;e meadows are dug to the depth of eight
or ten feet. . . . . Next to the upper &s;tratum,
there is a bed of turf about a foot thick, and
impregnated with river and land-&s;hells. . . . .'</P>
<P>'This bed of turf filled with &s;hells is com|monly
earthy: Tho&s;e which &s;ucceed are near|ly
of the &s;ame thickne&s;s, and are always better
as we de&s;cend. The&s;e turfs are of a blacki&s;h
brown colour, intermixed with reeds, ru&s;hes,
<PB N="236" REF="243">
and other plants. We &s;ee no &s;hells in the&s;e
beds. . . . .'</P>
<P>'In ma&s;&s;es of turf we &s;ometimes find the
&s;tems of willow and poplars, and &s;ometimes
the roots of the&s;e and &s;imilar trees. On the
E&s;charcon &s;ide, an oak was di&s;covered at the
depth of nine feet. It was black and almo&s;t
corrupted. It crumbled into du&s;t, after being
expo&s;ed to the air. Another was found, on the
Roi&s;&s;y &s;ide, between the &s;oil and the turf, at
the depth of two feet. Near E&s;charcon, the
horns of a &s;tag were found three or four feet
below the &s;urface. . . .'</P>
<P>'Turfs are perhaps equally abundant in the
environs of Etampes, as near Villeroy. The&s;e
turfs contain but very little mo&s;s. Their co|lour
is a fine black. They are heavy, and
burn well in an ordinary fire. Good charcoal
might be made of them. . . .'</P>
<P>'The turfs in the neighbourhood of Etampes
may be con&s;idered as a continuation of tho&s;e
of Villeroy. In a word, all the meadows ad|jacent
to the river of Etampes are probably
full of turf. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ame remark is applicable to
the meadows through which the river E&s;&s;one
runs: The&s;e meadows produce the &s;ame plants
as tho&s;e of Etampes and Villeroy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1761, p. 380.&mdash;397.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>According to this author, there are in France
a number of places from which turf may be ob|tained,

at Bruneval, in the environs of P&eacute;ronne,

<P>There are likewi&s;e turfs near Vitry-le-fran|cois,

<P>'IN the territories of the Duke of Sax-Co|bourg,
which lie on the frontiers of Franco|nia

they were as beautiful and hard as agates.

numerous fragments of wood, which every

<P>'In the territory of Cobourg, which is a
branch of the hou&s;e of Saxe, we find,' M. Ju&s;|ti
remarks, 'petrified wood of a prodigious
&s;ize. In the mountains of Mi&s;nia, entire trees
have been dug out of the earth, which were
converted into very fine agate. The Imperial
<PB N="239" REF="246">
cabinet of Vienna contains many petrifications
of this kind. A great log of this wood was
&s;ent to the &s;ame cabinet: The part which had
been wood was changed into a beautiful agate
of a grayi&s;h black colour; and, in&s;tead of bark,
the trunk was &s;urrounded with a belt of fine
white agate. . . . .'</P>
<P>'The pre&s;ent Emperor wi&s;hed that a method
of a&s;certaining the age of petrifactions might
be di&s;covered. . . . . . He ordered his
amba&s;&s;ador at Con&s;tantinople to a&s;k per|mi&s;&s;ion
to take up from the Danube one of the
piles of Trajan's bridge, which is &s;ome miles
below Belgrade. This permi&s;&s;ion being grant|ed,
one of the piles was drawn up, which it
was imagined would have been petrified by
the water. But, after &s;uch a lap&s;e of time, it
was di&s;covered that the proce&s;s of petrifaction
had made very little progre&s;s. Though this
pile had remained in the Danube above 1600
years, the petrifaction had not proceeded above
three quarters of an inch, and even le&s;s. The
re&s;t of the wood was very little altered, and
had only begun to be calcined.'</P>
<P>'If a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, with regard to all other
petrifactions, could be drawn from this &s;ingle
fact, Nature would perhaps require fifty thou|&s;and
years to change trees, of the &s;ize of tho&s;e
found petrified in certain places, into &s;tones.
But, in particular &s;ituations, many cau&s;es may
concur in ha&s;tening the proce&s;s of petrifac|tion. . . . .'</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247">
'At Vienna there is to be &s;een a petrified

change the wood has undergone, that we per|ceive

<P>M. Clozier, who found different pieces of pe|trified
wood upon the hills in the neighbour|hood
of Etampes, and particularly on that of
Saint-Symphorien, imagined that the&s;e frag|ments
might have proceeded from &s;ome petrifi|ed
trunks in the mountains. He, therefore,
cau&s;ed pits to be dug in a part of the mountain
of Saint-Symphorien that had been pointed out
to him. After digging &s;everal feet deep, he fir&s;t
<PB N="241" REF="248">
di&s;covered a petrified root, which led him to the
trunk of a tree of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This root, from its extremity to its junction
with the trunk, was, &s;ays M. Clozier, five
feet in length; there were other five roots, but
not equally long. . . . .</P>
<P>The middling and &s;mall roots were not pe|trified,
or at lea&s;t their petrification was &s;o
brittle, that they remained in the &s;and, where
the trunk was in the form of powder or a&s;hes.
It is rea&s;onable to think, that, when the proce&s;s
of petrifaction was communicated to the&s;e roots,
they had been almo&s;t corrupted, and that the
ligneous parts of which they were compo|&s;ed,
being too much &s;eparated by petrifac|tion,
could not acquire the degree of &s;olidity
nece&s;&s;ary to a genuine petrifaction. . . .</P>
<P>The thicke&s;t part of the trunk was near &s;ix
feet in circumference. Its length was three feet
ten inches, and its weight was from five to &s;ix
hundred pounds. The trunk, as well as the
roots, had all the appearance of wood, as the
bark, the inner rhind, the &s;olid and corrupted
wood, the holes of large and &s;mall worms, and
even the excrements of the&s;e worms. All the&s;e

piece of petrified wood with the following hi|&s;torical
account:</P>
<P>'The piece of petrified wood, which I have
the honour of tran&s;mitting to you, was found
at the depth of more than 150 feet below the
&s;urface. . . . La&s;t year (1754) when digging
a pit in que&s;t of coal, at Notre-Dame-au-bois,
a village &s;ituated between Cond&eacute;, Saint-Amand,
Mortagne, and Valenciennes, we found, a|bout
600 fathoms from E&s;caut, and after pa&s;|&s;ing
three water-levels, fir&s;t &s;even feet of
rock or hard &s;tone called <HI>tourtia</HI> in the lan|guage
of colliers; afterwards, when we ar|rived
at a mar&s;hy earth, we found, at the depth
of 150 feet, as already remarked, the trunk of a
tree of two feet in diameter, which lay acro&s;s
the pit, and, of cour&s;e, we were prevented
from mea&s;uring its length. It re&s;ted upon a
large free-&s;tone; and many pieces were cut
off from this trunk by the curious. The &s;mall
fragment I have the honour of &s;ending you
was cut off from a &s;pecimen given to M. Lau|rent,
a learned mechanic. . . .'</P>
<P>'This wood &s;eemed rather to have been convert|ed
into coal than petrified. How could a tree be
&s;unk &s;o deep into the earth? Has the &s;oil in
which the tree was found been formerly as low?
If that is the ca&s;e, how could this &s;oil be aug|mented
150 feet? From whence did all this
earth proceed?'</P>

You are &s;o intimately acquainted with Nature,
that none of her my&s;teries can be long conceal|ed

<P>M. Fougeroux de Bondaroy, of the Royal
Academy of Sciences, relates &s;everal facts
concerning petrified wood, which merit atten|tion.</P>
<P>'All the fibrous &s;tones,' he remarks, 'which
have &s;ome re&s;emblance to wood, are not petri|fied
wood. But there are many others which
mu&s;t be recogni&s;ed as &s;uch, e&s;pecially if we at|tend
to the peculiar organization of vege|tables. . . . .'</P>
<P>'Facts are not wanting to prove that wood
may be converted into &s;tone, with as much
ea&s;e at lea&s;t as &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances which
inconte&s;tibly undergo this tran&s;mutation. But
it is difficult to explain how this effect is pro|duced.
I hope I may be permitted to hazard
&s;ome conjectures on the &s;ubject, which I &s;hall'
<PB N="245" REF="252">
'endeavour to &s;upport by facts and ob&s;erva|tions.'</P>
<P>'We find wood which may be con&s;idered as
only half petrified, and not much heavier than
common wood. Specimens of this kind are
ea&s;ily divided into plates, or even into fila|ments,
like certain corrupted timber. Others
are more petrified, and have the weight, the
hardne&s;s, and the opacity of free-&s;tone. O|thers,
who&s;e petrifaction is &s;till more perfect,
admit the &s;ame poli&s;h as marble; while others
acquire that of fine oriental agates. I have an
excellent &s;pecimen &s;ent from Martinico to M.
du Hamel, which is converted into a mo&s;t
beautiful &s;ardonix. La&s;tly, we find wood
changed into &s;late. Among the&s;e &s;pecimens,
there are &s;ome which have retained the orga|nization
of wood &s;o completely, that we di&s;|cover
with a lens every appearance exhibited
in unpetrified wood.'</P>
<P>'We have &s;een &s;ome &s;pecimens encru&s;ted
with a &s;andy iron ore, and others penetrated
with a &s;ub&s;tance which, being compo&s;ed of &s;ul|phur
and vitriol, makes them approach the
&s;tate of pyrites. Some of them are, if we
may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, larded with a very
pure iron ore; and others are traver&s;ed by
veins of very black agate.'</P>
<P>'We find pieces of wood, one part of which
is converted into a &s;tone, and the other into
<PB N="246" REF="253">
agate: The part converted into &s;tone is ten|der;
but the other has the hardne&s;s peculiar
to precious &s;tones.'</P>
<P>'But, how &s;hould certain pieces, though con|verted
into hard agate, pre&s;erve the di&s;tinct
characters of organization, as the concentric
circles, the in&s;ertions, the extremities of the
tubes de&s;tined to tran&s;mit the &s;ap, the bark,
the inner rhind, and the wood? If the vege|table
&s;ub&s;tance were entirely de&s;troyed, we
&s;hould only &s;ee an agate, without any of the
organic characters formerly mentioned. To
pre&s;erve this appearance of organization, if we
&s;uppo&s;e that the wood &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and that the
pores alone are filled with the petrifying juice,
it &s;hould appear, that the vegetable parts might
be extracted from the agate. But I could ne|ver
make any progre&s;s in this operation: I,
therefore, think, that the &s;pecimens in que&s;tion
retain no parts which have pre&s;erved the na|ture
of wood. To give per&s;picuity to my i|dea,
I beg the reader to recollect, that, when
a piece of wood is di&s;tilled in a retort, the coal
which remains after di&s;tillation is not a &s;ixth
part of the original weight of the wood.
When this coal is burnt, we obtain only a
&s;mall quantity of a&s;hes, which will &s;till dimi|ni&s;h
after the lixivial &s;alts are ab&s;tracted.'</P>
<P>'This &s;mall quantity of a&s;hes being the only
fixed part, the chemical analy&s;is proves, that
<PB N="247" REF="254">
the fixed parts of a piece of wood are really
very trifling, and that the greate&s;t portion of
vegetable matter is de&s;tructible, and may be
gradually carried off, as the wood corrupts.'</P>
<P>'Now, if we con&s;ider that the greater part of
the wood is de&s;troyed, and that what remains
is a light earth, and ea&s;ily permeable by the
petrifying juice, its conver&s;ion into &s;tone, a|gate,
or &s;ardonix, will not be more difficult to
conceive than that of bole, clay, or any other
earth. The only difference is, that the vege|table
earth pre&s;erves the appearance of organi|zation,
and the petrifying juice in&s;inuates into
its pores, without de&s;troying its original cha|racters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1759, p. 431.&mdash;452.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Some facts and ob&s;ervations remain &s;till to
be added. In Augu&s;t 1773, at Montigni-&s;ur-Braine,
in the di&s;trict of Challon and juri&s;dic|tion
of Auxonne, when digging a copper mine,
the workmen, at the depth of 33 feet, found a
tree lying on its &s;ide; but the &s;pecies of it could
not be di&s;covered. The &s;uperior &s;trata &s;eemed
to have never been touched by the hand of
man; for, below the &s;oil, there was a bed of 8
feet of clay; then 10 feet of &s;and; then a bed
of fullers earth about 6 or 7 feet; then another
bed of the &s;ame mixed with &s;tones; and, la&s;tly,
a bed of black &s;and of 3 feet. The tree was
<PB N="248" REF="255">
found in the fullers earth. The river Braine
is to the ea&s;t, and not above a gun-&s;hot from

<P>M. de Grignon informed me, that, on the
borders of the Marne, near St Dizier, there is
a bed of pyritous wood, the organization of
which is apparent. This bed is &s;ituated under
a &s;tratum of free-&s;tone, which is covered with
a &s;tratum of pyrites, and above the pyrites is a
&s;tratum of lime-&s;tone. The bed of pyritous wood
lie upon a blacki&s;h clay.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e found, in the pits dug for di&s;co|vering
the &s;ubterraneous town of Ch&acirc;telet, in|&s;truments
of iron with wooden handles. He
remarked that this wood was converted into a
genuine iron-ore of the hematites &s;pecies. The
organization of the wood was not de&s;troyed;
but it was brittle, and its whole texture was as
clo&s;e as that of the hematites. The&s;e iron in|&s;truments
with wooden handles had been buried
in the earth &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen hundred years.
The conver&s;ion of the wood into hematites had
been affected by the decompo&s;ition of the iron,
which had gradually filled all the pores of the
wood.</P>

<HEAD>Of Bones &s;ometimes found in the interior parts of
the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>'IN the pari&s;h of Haux, which is &s;ituated
between two &s;eas, and about half a league
from the port of Langoiran, a point of a rock,
of 11 feet high, detached it&s;elf from the coa&s;t,
which was formerly 30 feet high. By its fall
it &s;pread over the valley a great quantity of a|nimal
bones or fragments of bones, &s;ome of
which were petrified. That they are bones is
unque&s;tionable; but it is difficult to a&s;certain the
animals to which they belong. The greate&s;t
number con&s;i&s;ts of teeth; &s;ome of them perhaps
belong to the ox or hor&s;e; but, without marking
the difference in figure, mo&s;t of them are larger
than the teeth of the&s;e animals. There are
likewi&s;e thigh or leg-bones, and a fragment
of a &s;tag or elk's horn. The whole are cover|ed
with common earth, and &s;ituated between
two &s;trata of rock. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the
carca&s;&s;es of animals have been thrown into a
hollow rock, and, after the fle&s;h had corrupt|ed,
a rock of 11 feet high had been formed
above them, which would require the opera|tion
of many ages. . . .'</P>
<P>'The Gentlemen of the Academy of Bour|deaux,

a fine poli&s;h. . . . It mu&s;t al&s;o be re|marked,
that bones which evidently belonged
to different animals were equally converted in|to
Turquois<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1719, p. 24.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>'On the 28th of January 1760,' &s;ays M. de
Guettard, 'there were found, 160 fathoms a|bove
the mineral baths, bones included in a
rock with a gray &s;urface. This rock was nei|ther
laminated nor con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eparate &s;trata,
but was one continued ma&s;s of &s;tone. . . .'</P>
<P>'After having, by means of gun-powder, pe|netrated
five feet deep into this rock, we found
a great number of human bones belonging to
every part of the body, as jaw-bones with their
teeth, bones of the arms, thighs, limbs, ribs,
rotulae, &amp;c. jumbled together in the greate&s;t
di&s;order. Entire &s;kulls, or portions of them,
chiefly prevailed.'</P>
<P>'Be&s;ide the&s;e human bones, we met with
&s;everal fragments which could not be a&s;cribed
to man. In &s;ome places, they are in conti|nued
ma&s;&s;es, and in other more di&s;per&s;ed. . .'</P>
<P>'When we arrived at the depth of four feet
and a half, we found &s;ix human heads in an
<PB N="251" REF="258">
inclined po&s;ition. In five of the&s;e heads, the
occiput with its appendages, except the bones
of the face, were pre&s;erved. This occiput was
partly encru&s;ted with &s;tone, its cavity was fill|ed
with &s;tone, and had a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame mould
or figure. In the &s;ixth head, the face is en|tire:
It is broad in proportion to its length.
We ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the form of the fle&s;hy
cheeks. The eyes are &s;hut, pretty long, but
narrow. The front is large, and the no&s;e ve|ry
flat, but well formed; the middle line is
di&s;tingui&s;hable. The mouth is well made,
and &s;hut; the upper lip is a little thick in pro|portion
to the under. The chin is well pro|portioned,
and the whole mu&s;cles are &s;trongly
marked. The colour of the head is reddi&s;h,
and re&s;embles tho&s;e of the Tritons feigned by
painters. Its &s;ub&s;tance is &s;imilar to that of
the &s;tone in which it was found; it is, proper|ly
&s;peaking, only the ma&s;k of the natural
head.'</P>
<P>The above relation was &s;ent by M. le Baron
de Gaillard-Lonjumeau to Madame de Boi&s;|jourdain,
who tran&s;mitted it to M. Guettard, with
&s;ome &s;pecimens of the bones. That the&s;e bones
were really human, is a very doubtful point;
'for every appearance in this quarry,' M. de
Lonjumeau remarks, 'announces that it has
been formed of relicks of bodies broken in
pieces, and which had been long to&s;&s;ed about
<PB N="252" REF="259">
by the waves of the &s;ea before they were col|lected
into one heap. As this ma&s;s of bones
lies horizontally, and has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively co|vered
with &s;tony matter, it is ea&s;y to conceive
how a ma&s;k was formed on the faces of tho&s;e
heads, the fle&s;h having little time to corrupt, e|&s;pecially
when the bodies were buried under the
water. We may, therefore, rea&s;onably con|clude,
that the&s;e heads were not human. . . .
They rather &s;eem to be the heads of tho&s;e fi&s;hes,
who&s;e teeth are found in the &s;ame parts of
the &s;tones along with the bones &s;uppo&s;ed to
belong to the human &s;pecies.'</P>
<P>'It appears that the collection of bones in
the environs of Aix, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e di&s;co|vered
&s;ome years ago by M. Borda near Dax
in Ga&s;cony. The teeth di&s;covered at Aix, by
the de&s;cription given of them, &s;eem to re&s;em|ble
tho&s;e found at Dax, of which an under
jaw is &s;till pre&s;erved. This jaw unque&s;tiona|bly
belongs to a large fi&s;h. . . . I mu&s;t, there|fore,
conclude, that the bones in the quarry of
Aix are &s;imilar to tho&s;e di&s;covered at Dax;. .
and that the&s;e bones, whatever they are,
&s;hould be referred to the &s;keletons of fi&s;hes
rather than to tho&s;e of man. . . .'</P>
<P>'One of the heads in que&s;tion was about &s;e|ven
and a half inches long by three and &s;ome
lines broad. Its figure is that of an oblong
globe, flat at the ba&s;e, thicker at the po&s;terior
<PB N="253" REF="260">
than the anterior end, and divided in the broad|e&s;t
part by &s;even or eight bands from &s;even
to twelve lines wide. Each band is likewi&s;e
divided into two equal parts by a &s;light fur|row.
The bands extend from the ba&s;e to the
&s;ummit. Tho&s;e of one &s;ide are &s;eparated from
tho&s;e of the other by another and deeper fur|row,
which gradually enlarges from the ante|rior
to the po&s;terior part.'</P>
<P>'From this de&s;cription we cannot recognize
the mould of a human head. The bones of
man's head are not divided into bands. The
human head is compo&s;ed of four principal
bones, the figures of which appear not in the
mould above de&s;cribed. It has not an interior
cre&s;t which extends longitudinally from the
anterior to the po&s;terior part, and divides it
into two equal parts, which might give ri&s;e to
the furrow on the &s;uperior part of the &s;tony
mould.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e con&s;iderations induce me to think,
that this &s;ub&s;tance is rather the body of a nau|tilus
than a human head. There are nautili
actually divided into bands or bucklers like this
mould. They have a channel or furrow which
runs along the whole curvature, and divides
them into two, from which the &s;tony furrow
might derive its origin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e 1760, p. 209.&mdash;218.</NOTE>,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261">
I am per&s;uaded, as well as M. le Baron de
Lonjumeau, that the&s;e heads never belonged to
men, but to animals of the &s;eal kind, to &s;ea|otters,
and to &s;ea lions or bears. It is not at
Aix or Dax alone, that the heads and bones of
the&s;e animals are found in rocks and caverns.
His Highne&s;s the pre&s;ent Prince Marcgrave of
An&s;pach, who to great affability unites a re|markable
ta&s;te for knowledge, has been &s;o o|bliging
as to give me, for the Royal Cabinet,
a collection of bones from the caverns of Gail|lenrente
in his Marcgraviate of Bareith. M.
Daubenton has compared the&s;e bones with tho&s;e
of the common bear, from which they differ
only by being larger. The head and teeth are
longer and thicker; and the muzzle is longer
and more protuberant than in our large&s;t bears.
In this collection, with which this noble Prince
has enriched our cabinet, there is a head which
naturali&s;ts have denominated <HI>the head of M. de
Buffon's &s;mall &s;eal</HI>; but, as we know not the form
and &s;tructure of the heads of &s;ea lions, bears,
and large and &s;mall &s;eals, we &s;hall &s;u&s;pend our
judgment concerning the animals to which the&s;e

<HEAD>ADDITIONS to the Article, Of the
Changes of Sea into Land, Vol. I. p. 483.</HEAD>
<P>IN traver&s;ing the coa&s;ts of France, we perceive
that a part of Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tany, Picardy, Flanders, and
Lower Normandy, have very recently been de|&s;erted
by the &s;ea; becau&s;e, through all this ex|tent
of country, we &s;till find great quantities of
oy&s;ters, and other &s;hells, in their natural &s;tate.
We are certain, from experience, that, for a cen|tury
pa&s;t, the &s;ea has been retiring from the
coa&s;t of Dunkirk. When the moles of this port
were con&s;tructing in the year 1670, the fort of
Good-hope, which terminate one of the&s;e moles,
was built upon piles a great way beyond the
low water-mark. But, at pre&s;ent, the water
never advances nearer this fort than 300 fa|thoms.
In 1714, when the new harbour of Mar|dik
was deepening, the moles were likewi&s;e car|ried
beyond the low water-mark; but now,
when the tide is ebb, there is a dry &s;pace of
more than 500 fathoms. If the &s;ea continues
thus gradually to retire, Dunkirk, like Aigue|mortes,
will, in a few centuries, be no longer a
<PB N="256" REF="263">
&s;ea-port. If the &s;ea has lo&s;t ground &s;o con&s;ider|ably
in our times, how far mu&s;t it have retired
&s;ince the beginning of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour la &s;ubdelegation de Dunkerque, relativement &agrave; la Hi&s;t. nat. de ce canton.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The bare in&s;pection of Saintonge is &s;ufficient
to convince us, that it was formerly covered by
the &s;ea. The ocean having abandoned the&s;e
lands, the Charente followed as the waters re|tired,
and formed a river where formerly there
was only a great lake or mora&s;s. The country
of Aunis, which was anciently covered by the
&s;ea and &s;tagnant waters, is one of the mo&s;t re|cent
lands of France. It is even probable that
this territory was a mora&s;s about the end of the
fourteenth century<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Extrait de l'hi&s;t. de la Rochelle, art. 2. et 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that the ocean, during
&s;ome centuries, has retired many feet from all
our coa&s;ts; and if we examine tho&s;e of the Me|diterranean,
from Rou&s;&s;illon to Provence, we
&s;hall find that this &s;ea has likewi&s;e retreated
nearly in the &s;ame proportion. The&s;e facts
render it evident, that the circumference of all
the coa&s;ts of Spain and Portugal, as well as tho&s;e
of France, is greatly extended. The &s;ame ob|&s;ervation
has been made with regard to Sweden,

in the cour&s;e of 4000 years, the Baltic, the depth
of which exceeds not thirty fathoms, will be
totally abandoned by the waters.</P>

If &s;imilar ob&s;ervations were made in every
country, I am per&s;uaded, that, in general, the

coa&s;t. The &s;ame cau&s;es which produced its fir&s;t
retreat and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;inking, are not ab&s;olutely
annihilated. In the beginning, the &s;ea was two
thou&s;and fathoms above its pre&s;ent level. The
immen&s;e &s;wellings on the &s;urface of the globe,
which fir&s;t &s;ub&s;ided, made the waters &s;ink, at fir&s;t
rapidly, and afterwards in proportion as the
more incon&s;iderable caverns gave way. The
&s;ea, of cour&s;e, was proportionally depre&s;&s;ed; and,
as many caverns &s;till exi&s;t, which mu&s;t, from
time to time, &s;ink, either by the action of vol|cano's,

<P>The fir&s;t fact, namely, the elevation of the
globe at the Equator and its depre&s;&s;ion at the
poles, has been mathematically demon&s;trated and
phy&s;ically proved by the theory of gravitation,
and by experiments with the pendulum. The
figure of the earth is preci&s;ely the &s;ame which a
fluid globe revolving round its axis with equal
celerity would a&s;&s;ume. Hence the matter of
which the earth is compo&s;ed was in a &s;tate of
fluidity the moment it a&s;&s;umed its form, and this
moment happened whenever it began to turn
round its own axis. Now, though heat is the
general cau&s;e of fluidity, &s;ince water it&s;elf, with|out
heat, would form a &s;olid ma&s;s, we have two
methods of conceiving the po&s;&s;ibility of the pri|mitive
fluid &s;tate of the earth. The fir&s;t is the
&s;olution of terre&s;trial matters in water; and
the &s;econd is their liquefaction by fire. But
mo&s;t of the &s;olid matters of which the earth is
compo&s;ed are not &s;oluble in water; and, at the
&s;ame time, the quantity of water, in proportion
to that of dry and &s;olid matter, is &s;o &s;mall, that
it is impo&s;&s;ible the one could be di&s;&s;olved by the
other. Of cour&s;e, as this &s;tate of fluidity could
not be effected by di&s;&s;olution or maceration in
water, this fluidity mu&s;t have been produced by
the operation of fire.</P>

of the globe, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts partially, and
is greater than that afforded by the &s;un, &s;hews
that this primitive fire is not yet nearly di&s;&s;i|pated.
The &s;urface of the earth is colder
than its interior parts. Uncontrovertible and
reiterated experiments evince, that the whole
ma&s;s of the globe has a heat proper to it&s;elf,
and totally independent of that of the &s;un.
This heat is rendered evident by comparing
our winters with our &s;ummers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Suppl. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 1 <HI>part.</HI> 1. and particularly the two Me|moirs <HI>&s;ur la temperature des p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&egrave;tes,</HI> Suppl. tom. 2.</NOTE>; and it is

<P>'At no great depth, we perceive a heat which
never varies with the temperature of the

thermometer remains, during the whole year,
at the &s;ame height in the caves of the Ob&s;erva|tory,
which exceed not 84 feet or 14 fathoms

been fixed as the mean temperature of our

<P>Though our deepe&s;t mines and pits are

from the temperature of the ocean,

nearly the &s;ame heat as that of the in|terior

<P>Be&s;ides, it is ea&s;y to &s;how, that the fluidity of
the ocean ought not, in general, to be a&s;cribed
to the powers of the &s;olar rays; &s;ince we learn
from experience, that the light of the &s;un
does not penetrate the mo&s;t limpid water above
&s;ix hundred feet; and, of cour&s;e, that its heat
will not reach above a fourth part of that
depth, or one hundred and fifty feet. The
late M. Bouguer, a learned a&s;tronomer of the
Royal Academy of Sciences, found, that, when
&s;ixteen pieces of common gla&s;s were applied
to each other, and making a thickne&s;s of 9&frac12;
lines, the light, in pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e &s;ixteen
pieces of gla&s;s, was dimini&s;hed 247 times. He
then placed &s;eventy-four pieces of the &s;ame
gla&s;s, in a tube, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from
each other. When this experiment was made,
the &s;un was 50 degrees above the horizon. A
very faint appearance of the &s;un's di&s;k was &s;till
perceptible through the&s;e 74 pieces of gla&s;s.
The per&s;ons who attended him could likewi&s;e
perceive, but with difficulty, a feeble light.
But, when other three pieces of gla&s;s were ad|ded
to the &s;eventy-four none of them could
di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of light. Hence,
<PB N="266" REF="273">
if we &s;uppo&s;e eighty pieces of the &s;ame gla&s;s,
we have a thickne&s;s which will render it per|fectly
opaque.</P>
<P>From this analogy between the tran&s;parency
of gla&s;s and water, M. Bouguer found, that, to
render &s;ea-water, which is the mo&s;t limpid of
all waters, perfectly opaque, a thickne&s;s of 256
feet is nece&s;&s;ary, provided, by another experi|ment,
the light of a flambeau was dimini&s;hed
in the proportion of 14 to 5 in traver&s;ing 115
inches of water contained in a tube of 9 feet 7
inches in length. Hence, according to M. Bou|guer,
no &s;en&s;ible light can pa&s;s deeper than 256
feet in water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ai d'Optique &s;ur la gradation de la lumi&eacute;re, p. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears to me, however, that the conclu|&s;ion
drawn by M. Bouguer is very di&s;tant from
the truth. His experiments &s;hould have been
made with ma&s;&s;es of gla&s;s of different thick|ne&s;&s;es,
and not with &s;eparate pieces applied to
each other. I am per&s;uaded that the &s;un's
light would penetrate a greater thickne&s;s than
that of the&s;e eighty pieces, which formed a
thickne&s;s of no more than 47&frac12; lines, or near 4
inches. Now, though the&s;e pieces he employ|ed
were of common gla&s;s, it is certain that a
&s;olid ma&s;s of the &s;ame gla&s;s, of four inches thick,
would not entirely intercept the light of the
&s;un, e&s;pecially as I know, by my own experi|ence,
that light pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily through 6 &s;olid
<PB N="267" REF="274">
inches of white gla&s;s. I believe, therefore, that
the thickne&s;&s;es a&s;&s;umed by M. Bouguer &s;hould
be more than doubled, and that the light of
the &s;un penetrates 600 feet deep into the waters
of the ocean; for there is another inaccuracy
in M. Bouguer's experiments. He did not
make the light of the &s;un pa&s;s through his tube
of 9 feet 7 inches long: He employed the
light of a flambeau, and thence concluded the
diminution to be in the proportion of 14 to 5.
But I am per&s;uaded, that, if the light of the &s;un
had been employed, this diminution would not
have been &s;o great, e&s;pecially as the light of a
flambeau could only pa&s;s obliquely, whil&s;t that
of the &s;un, by pa&s;&s;ing directly, would have pene|trated
deeper by its incidence alone, independent
of its purity and inten&s;ity. Thus, taking all
circum&s;tances into con&s;ideration, it appears, that,
to approach the truth as near as po&s;&s;ible, we
&s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the light of the &s;un pene|trates
the &s;ea to the depth of 600 feet, and that
its heat reaches 150 feet deep. The light and
heat mu&s;t here be under&s;tood as &s;en&s;ible degrees
only of the&s;e qualities.</P>
<P>That the heat of the &s;un penetrates not above
150 feet deep in the waters of the ocean, I a&s;|certained
by analogy derived from an experi|ment
which appears to be deci&s;ive. With a
lens of 27 inches diameter by &s;ix inches thick
at the centre, I perceived, that, by covering the
<PB N="268" REF="275">
middle part, the lens burnt only from the cir|cumference
as far as four inches thick, and that
all the thicker part &s;carcely produced any heat.
I then covered the whole lens, except an inch
round the centre, and I found, that, after pa&s;|&s;ing
this thickne&s;s of &s;ix inches of gla&s;s, the
light of the &s;un had no influence on the thermo|meter.
Hence I am warranted to pre&s;ume, that
this &s;ame light, weakened by 150 feet thick of
water, would not produce a perceptible degree
of heat.</P>
<P>The light proceeding from the moon is un|que&s;tionably
a reflected light of the &s;un. This
light, however, has no &s;en&s;ible heat, even when
the rays are collected into the focus of a burn|ing-gla&s;s.
Neither would the light of the &s;un
have any heat, after pa&s;&s;ing through a certain
depth of water; becau&s;e it would then be e|qually
feeble as that of the moon I am, there|fore,
per&s;uaded, that, by allowing the rays of
the &s;un to pa&s;s through a large tube filled with
water, and only 50 feet long, which is no more
than a third of the depth I have &s;uppo&s;ed, this
feeble light would produce no effect upon the
thermometer, even though the liquor &s;tood at
the freezing point. From whence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> may con|clude,
that, though the light of the &s;un pene|trates
600 feet in the waters of the ocean, its
heat would not reach one fourth part of that
depth. All the waters below this point would
<PB N="269" REF="276">
nece&s;&s;arily freeze, unle&s;s there was an internal
heat in the earth, which alone can maintain
their fluidity. In the &s;ame manner, it is proved
by experience that the heat of the &s;olar rays pe|netrates
not above 15 or 20 feet deep in the
earth, &s;ince ice is pre&s;erved at the&s;e depths du|ring
the warme&s;t &s;ummers. Hence, it is clear,
that, below the ba&s;in of the &s;ea, as well as un|der
the &s;uperior &s;trata of the earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
perpetual emanation of heat, which &s;upports <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he
fluidity of the waters, and produces the tem|perature
of the earth. In the interior parts of
the earth, therefore, a heat exi&s;ts which is pro|per
to it, and which is totally independent of
that communicated by the &s;un.</P>
<P>We might confirm this general fact by a num|ber
of particular ones. Every man has remark|ed,
that the &s;now melts in all places where the
vapours of the interior parts of the earth have
a free i&s;&s;ue, as over pits, covered aqueducts,
vaults, ci&s;terns, &amp;c. while in all other places,
where the earth, bound up by the fro&s;t, inter|cepts
the&s;e vapours, the &s;now not only remains,
but, in&s;tead of melting, freezes. This circum|&s;tance
is alone &s;ufficient to &s;how, that the&s;e e|manations
from the internal parts of the earth
have a real and &s;en&s;ible degree of heat.</P>

globe, at lea&s;t all tho&s;e which are known to us,
have gla&s;s for their ba&s;is, and may be ultimately
reduced to their primitive &s;tate.</P>
<P>We have, therefore, proved the original li|quefaction
by fire of the whole ma&s;s of this
globe, agreeably to the mo&s;t rigorous rules of
logic: 1. <HI>A priori,</HI> by the fir&s;t fact, namely, the
elevation of the earth at the equator, and its
depre&s;&s;ion at the poles. 2. <HI>Ab actu,</HI> by the

by the fourth fact, which &s;hows the ef|fect
of this action of fire, <HI>i. e.</HI> gla&s;s in all terre&s;|trial
&s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>But, though the materials which compo&s;e this
globe have originally been of a vitreous nature,
and may all be reduced to gla&s;s, they ought to
be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other with regard to
the different &s;tates in which they are found be|fore
they are converted into gla&s;s by the action
of fire. They &s;hould, in the fir&s;t place, be di|vided
into vitrifiable and calcarious &s;ub&s;tances.
The fir&s;t undergo no change by fire, unle&s;s it
be pu&s;hed to &s;uch a degree of inten&s;ity as is &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="272" REF="279">
to reduce them to gla&s;s; but an inferior
degree of heat reduces the others to lime. The
quantity of calcarious &s;ub&s;tances, though very
con&s;iderable, is &s;mall when compared to tho&s;e
which are vitrifiable. The <HI>fifth</HI> fact above laid
down proves, that calcarious bodies have been
formed at a different period, and by another ele|ment;
and we evidently perceive, that all the
matters which have not been produced by the
immediate action of the primitive fire, have been
formed by the intervention of water; becau&s;e
they are all compo&s;ed of &s;hells and other relicks
of marine bodies. Under the cla&s;s of vitrifi|able
&s;ub&s;tances are comprehended pure rock,
quartz, &s;and, free-&s;tone, granite, &s;lates, clays,
metals, and metallic minerals. The&s;e &s;ub|&s;tances
form the genuine ba&s;is of the globe,
and compo&s;e its principal and greate&s;t part. The
whole of them have been originally produced
by the primitive fire. Sand is nothing but gla&s;s
in powder; &s;lates, dried clays, pure rock, free-&s;tone,
and granite, are only vitreous ma&s;&s;es, or vitri|fiable
&s;and in a concreted form. Flints, cry|&s;tals,
metals, and mo&s;t other minerals, are only
di&s;tillations, exudations, or &s;ublimations of the
fir&s;t matters, all of which unfold their primi|tive
origin and their common nature, by their
aptitude of being converted into gla&s;s.</P>
<P>But calcarious &s;and and gravel, chalk, brown
free-&s;tone, marble, alaba&s;tar, calcarious &s;patha,
<PB N="273" REF="280">
both opaque and tran&s;parent, in a word, every
&s;ub&s;tance which can be converted into lime,
do not at fir&s;t exhibit their original nature.
Though, like all the others, they proceed from
gla&s;s, calcarious bodies have pa&s;&s;ed through fil|tres,
which have changed their appearance.
They have been formed by water. They are
compo&s;ed entirely of madrepores, &s;hells, and o|ther
relicks of aquatic animals, which alone
are capable of converting fluids into &s;olids, and
of transforming the water of the &s;ea into &s;tone.
Common marble and other calcarious &s;tones are
compo&s;ed of entire &s;hells and fragments of &s;hells,
of madrepores, a&s;troites, &amp;c. all the parts of which
are either &s;till evident, or ea&s;ily recogni&s;able.
Gravel is nothing but broken fragments of
marble and calcarious &s;tones which fro&s;t and
the action of the air detach from the rocks;
and they are equally convertible into lime. Lime
may al&s;o be made of &s;hells, chalk, and light
land-&s;tone. Alaba&s;ter, and tho&s;e marbles which
contain alaba&s;ter, may be regarded as large
&s;talacti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es, which are formed at the expence of
other marbles and common &s;tones. Calcarious
&s;patha is likewi&s;e formed by exudation or di&s;til|lation
from calcarious &s;ub&s;tances, in the &s;ame
manner as rock-cry&s;tal originates from vitri|&s;iable
matters. All this may be proved by in|&s;pecting
the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances, and by ex|amining
attentively the great monuments of

<P>By comparing the&s;e monuments with the
facts, we at once perceive, that the time when
<PB N="276" REF="283">
vitrifiable &s;ub&s;tances were formed is much more
remote than that of the formation of calcarious
bodies; and may now di&s;tingui&s;h four and even
five epochs of the remote&s;t antiquity: The fir&s;t,
when the matter of the globe was in fu&s;ion by
fire, when the earth a&s;&s;umed its form, and the
Equator was elevated and the Poles depre&s;&s;ed by
its rotatory motion: The &s;econd, when this mat|ter
con&s;olidated, and formed the great ma&s;&s;es of
vitrifiable &s;ub&s;tances: The third, when the &s;ea
covered the whole land now inhabited, and nou|ri&s;hed
&s;hell-animals, the remains of which have
formed calcarious bodies: The fourth, when
the waters which cover our Continents retired
to their proper ba&s;ins: A fifth epoch, the indi|cations
of which are equally clear as the other
four, is the time when the elephant, the hippo|potamus,
and other &s;outhern animals, inhabited
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">gions of the north. This epoch is evident|ly
po&s;terior to the fourth, &s;ince the relicks of
terrestrial animals are found near the &s;urface of
the earth, whil&s;t tho&s;e of marine animals are ge|nerally,
and even in the &s;ame places, buried at
great depths.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>What, Will any man maintain, that ele|phants,
and other animals now peculiar to the
&s;outh, have formerly inhabited the regions of
the north? This fact, however &s;ingular and ex|traordinary
it may appear, is not the le&s;s cer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">.
Great quantities of ivory have been and
<PB N="277" REF="284">
daily are found in Siberia, in Ru&s;&s;ia, and in o|ther
northern countries of Europe and A&s;ia.
The&s;e tu&s;ks of the elephant are found &s;ome
feet below the earth, or they are expo&s;ed by
the waters when they break down the banks
of rivers. We find the&s;e tu&s;ks and bones of
the elephant in &s;o many places, and in &s;uch
quantities, that they never could be brought
into &s;uch cold regions by human power. From
inconte&s;tible and reiterated proofs, we are o|bliged
to acknowledge, that the&s;e animals were
formerly natives of the north, as they are now
of the &s;outh. What renders this fact more mar|vellous
and more difficult to explain, we find the
remains of tho&s;e animals, now peculiar to the &s;outh
of the Old Continent, not only in our northern
provinces, but likewi&s;e in Canada and other
parts of North America. In the Royal cabinet
there are &s;everal tu&s;ks and many bones of the
elephant, which were found in Siberia. We
have other tu&s;ks and bones of the &s;ame animal
which were found in France; as well as teeth of
the hippopotamus di&s;covered in America, near
the river Ohio. Hence the&s;e animals, which
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in cold countries, have formerly
exi&s;ted in northern climates. Of cour&s;e, the
Frozen Zone was at that period equally warm as
our Torrid Zone is at pre&s;ent; for it is impo&s;&s;ible
that the bodily con&s;titution and real habits of
the&s;e animals, which are the mo&s;t permanent and
invariable things in nature, &s;hould &s;o far change
<PB N="278" REF="285">
as to be&s;tow the temperature of the rain-deer upon
the elephant. Neither can we &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e
&s;outhern animals, which require much heat for their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, could ever live and multiply in nor|thern
regions, if the climate were equally cold as
it is at pre&s;ent. M. Gmelin, who travelled in Sibe|ria,
and there collected many bones of the elephant,
&s;uppo&s;es that va&s;t inundations in the &s;outh had
driven the elephants to the north, where they would
all peri&s;h at once by the rigour of the climate.
But this cau&s;e is not proportioned to the effect.
More ivory, perhaps, has already been brought
from the north than all the elephants of India now
exi&s;ting could furni&s;h. Much more will be di&s;|covered
when the va&s;t de&s;erts of the north, which
are &s;carcely known, &s;hall be peopled, and the
earth cultivated and dug by the hands of man.
Be&s;ides, it is extremely improbable, that the&s;e
animals &s;hould take the route which is mo&s;t re|pugnant
to their nature; for, if they were
pu&s;hed by inundations from the &s;outh, why did
they not rather fly to the ea&s;t and we&s;t? Why
did they fly as far as the &s;ixtieth degree of north
latitude, when they might have &s;topt on the
road, or turned a&s;ide to more fortunate climates?
And how is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, that, by an
inundation from the &s;outhern ocean, the ele|phants
were cha&s;ed a thou&s;and leagues into the
Old Continent, and more than three thou&s;and
into the New? It is impo&s;&s;ible that an inunda|tion
from the Indian ocean &s;hould drive the e|lephants
<PB N="279" REF="286">
into Canada, or even into Siberia; and
it is equally impo&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould arrive
in &s;uch numbers as are indicated by their re|mains.</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;atisfied with this explication, I imagined
that a more plau&s;ible one might be given, and
which &s;hould perfectly corre&s;pond with my the|ory
of the earth. But, before exhibiting my
ideas on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall, to prevent mi&s;|takes,
remark, 1. That the ivory found in Sibe|ria
and in Canada unque&s;tionably belongs to
the elephant, and not to the mor&s;e or &s;ea-cow,
as &s;ome voyagers have pretended. In the north|ern
regions, we likewi&s;e find the fo&s;&s;il ivory of
the mor&s;e; but it is different from that of the
elephant; and they are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by
comparing their internal texture. The tu&s;ks,
the grinders, the &s;capulae, the thigh-bones, and
other bones found in the northern climates, cer|tainly
belong to the elephant; it is even impo&s;|&s;ible
to he&s;itate concerning the identity of
the &s;pecies. The large &s;quare teeth di&s;covered
in the &s;ame northern countries, the grinding
&s;ide of which re&s;embles the &s;pade painted on
cards, have every mark of the dentes molares
of the hippopotamus; and tho&s;e enormous teeth,
the grinding &s;ide of which is compo&s;ed of large
blunt points or protuberances, have belonged
to &s;ome terre&s;trial animal that now no longer
exi&s;ts, like the great volutes called <HI>cornua ammo|nis,</HI>
which at pre&s;ent exi&s;t not in the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="287">
2. The bones and tu&s;ks of the&s;e ancient ele|phants
are every way as large as tho&s;e of the
Indian elephants, to which we have compared
them. This is a proof that the&s;e animals did
not inhabit the northern regions from any ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
&s;ince they acquired, in that &s;ituation,
their full growth and complete dimen&s;ions. Of
this fact we may be a&s;certained by the de&s;crip|tions
and dimen&s;ions of them given by M.
Daubeuton under the article <HI>Elephant.</HI> But,
&s;ince that time, I have had tran&s;mitted to me an
entire tu&s;k and &s;ome fragments of fo&s;&s;il ivory,
the length and breadth of which greatly exceed
the tu&s;ks of the common elephant. I &s;earched
all the &s;hops of the Paris ivory-merchants; but
I found no tu&s;k which could be compared to
that in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But, of a great number, I
found only one equal to tho&s;e &s;ent from Siberia,
who&s;e circumference at the ba&s;e is nineteen in|ches.
Ivory, which is taken from living ele|phants,
or from recent &s;keletons found in the
fore&s;ts, is denominated <HI>raw ivory</HI>; and the
appellation of <HI>roa&s;ied ivory</HI> is given to that ex|tracted
from the earth, the quality of which is
more or le&s;s altered, according to the time it has
remained under ground, or according to the quali|ty
of the earth in which it has been buried. Mo&s;t
tu&s;ks which come from the North are &s;till very
&s;olid, and very fine works may be made of them.
The large&s;t were &s;ent to us by M. de L'I&s;le, an
a&s;tronomer, and member of the Royal Academy
<PB N="281" REF="288">
of Sciences. He collected them in his travels
through Siberia. In all the &s;hops of Paris, there
was not a &s;ingle tu&s;k of raw ivory which mea|&s;ured
nineteen inches in circumference: They
were all &s;maller. This tu&s;k was &s;ix feet and an
inch in length; and it appears, that tho&s;e in the
Royal Cabinet, which were found in Siberia,
were, when entire, more than &s;ix feet and a half:
But, as their extremities were cut off, we could
only make a near gue&s;s at their real length.</P>
<P>If we compare the thigh-bones found in the
&s;ame northern countries, we &s;hall be &s;atisfied that
they are at lea&s;t equally long, and con&s;iderably
thicker, than tho&s;e of the Indian elephants.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as formerly remarked, we have made
an exact compari&s;on of the bones and tu&s;ks &s;ent
from Siberia with tho&s;e of the &s;keleton of an e|lephant,
and we found that all the&s;e bones are
evidently the relicks of the&s;e animals. The Si|berian
tu&s;ks have not only the figure, but the
genuine &s;tructure of elephant ivory, which M.
Daubenton de&s;cribes in the following terms.</P>
<P>'When an elephant's tu&s;k is cut tran&s;ver&s;ely,
we &s;ee, at or near the centre, a black point cal|led
the <HI>heart.</HI> But, if the tu&s;k is cut where it
is hollow, there is only a round hole in the
centre. We perceive crooked lines which ex|tend
in different directions from the centre to
the circumference, and, by cro&s;&s;ing, form &s;mall
lozenges. At the circumference, there is com|monly
a narrow circular band. The crooked
<PB N="282" REF="289">
lines ramify in proportion as they recede from
the centre. Hence the &s;ize of the lozenges is
nearly the &s;ame throughout. Their &s;ides, or at
lea&s;t their angles, are of a more lively colour
than the areas, doubtle&s;s becau&s;e their &s;ub&s;tance
is more compact. The band at the circum|ference
is compo&s;ed of &s;traight and tran&s;ver&s;e
fibres, which, if prolonged, would terminate in
the centre. It is the appearance of the&s;e lines
and points which is con&s;idered as the grain of
the ivory. This grain is perceptible in all ivories;
but it is more or le&s;s di&s;tinct in different tu&s;ks;
and, when the grain is &s;ufficiently apparent, the
ivory gets the name of <HI>large grained,</HI> to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
it from that who&s;e grain is fine.'</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that elephants could be
tran&s;ported into Siberia by men; for the &s;tate of
captivity alone, independent of the rigour of the
climate, would have reduced them to a fourth
or a third of the dimen&s;ions which their remains
exhibit. Of this effect we have &s;ufficient proof
from the compari&s;on we have made between an
entire &s;keleton of an elephant in the Royal Ca|binet,
which had lived &s;ixteen years at Ver&s;ailles,
with the tu&s;ks of other elephants brought from
their native country. This &s;keleton and the&s;e
tu&s;ks, though of con&s;iderable &s;ize, are one half
&s;maller than the tu&s;ks and &s;keletons of the&s;e
which live in freedom in A&s;ia or in Africa; and,
at the &s;ame time, they are at lea&s;t two thirds
<PB N="283" REF="290">
&s;maller than the bones of the &s;ame animals found
in Siberia.</P>
<P>3. The great quantities of ivory already di&s;|covered
by accident in countries nearly de&s;ert,
and where no man &s;earches for it, &s;how, that it
is neither by one nor by &s;everal accidents, nor
at one and the &s;ame time, that &s;ome individuals
of this &s;pecies have found their way into the
northern regions, but that the &s;pecies had for|merly
exi&s;ted and multiplied there, in the &s;ame
manner as they now exi&s;t and multiply in &s;ou|thern
latitudes.</P>
<P>The only que&s;tion, therefore, which remains
to be &s;olved, is, Whether there is or has been a
cau&s;e that could &s;o change the temperature of
the different parts of the globe as to render the
northern regions, which are now extremely cold,
equally warm as the &s;outhern climates?</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers may imagine that this ef|fect
has been produced by the change in the o|bliquity
of the ecliptic; becau&s;e, at fir&s;t &s;ight, this
change &s;eems to indicate, that, as the inclination
of the axis of the globe is not permanent,
the earth might formerly revolve round an axis
&s;o different from that on which it now turns, as to
make Siberia then lie immediately under the E|quator.
A&s;tronomers have ob&s;erved, that the
change in the obliquity of the ecliptic is about
45 &s;econds in a century. Hence, by &s;uppo&s;ing
this augmentation to be con&s;tant and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive,
60 centuries would produce a di&s;tance of 45
<PB N="284" REF="291">
minutes, and 3600 centuries would produce a
change of 45 degrees. Such an alteration would
bring back the 60th degree of latitude to the
15th, <HI>i. e.</HI> the country of Siberia, where the e|lephants
formerly exi&s;ted, to the regions of In|dia,
where they &s;till exi&s;t and multiply. Now,
it may be &s;aid, we have only to admit this long
lap&s;e of time in order to account for the regular
abode of elephants in Siberia: It is 360,000 years
ago &s;ince the earth revolved round an axis 45
degrees di&s;tant from that upon which it turns at
pre&s;ent: The 15th degree of latitude was then
the 60th, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that this idea, and the mode of
explication which re&s;ults from it, cannot, upon
examination, be &s;upported. The change in the
obliquity of the ecliptic is not a con&s;tant and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
diminution and augmentation. On the
contrary, it is a limited variation, and &s;ometimes
on one &s;ide and &s;ometimes on the other;
and, con&s;equently, can never produce, on any
&s;ide, nor in any climate, this difference of 45
degrees of inclination; for the variation in the o|bliquity
of the earth's axis is occa&s;ioned by
the action of the planets, which alter the &s;itua|tion
of the ecleptic, without affecting the equa|tor.
To take the &s;tronge&s;t of the&s;e attractions,
which is that of Venus, it would require
126,000 years to make a change of 180 degrees
in the ecliptic of that planet, and, of cour&s;e, to
produce an alteration of 6 degrees 47 minutes
<PB N="285" REF="292">
in the real obliquity of the earth's axis; &s;ince 6
degrees 47 minutes are the double of the incli|nation
of the orbit of Venus. In the &s;ame
manner, the action of Jupiter cannot, in 93,6000
years, change the obliquity of the ecliptic above
2 degrees 38 minutes; and &s;till this effect is in
part compen&s;ated by the preceding. Hence it
is impo&s;&s;ible that this change in the obliquity of
the earth's axis &s;hould ever amount to 6 degrees,
unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that the orbits of all the
plane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;hould likewi&s;e change; a &s;uppo&s;ition
which we cannot nor ought not to admit, &s;ince
no cau&s;e exi&s;ts which could produce this ef|fect.</P>
<P>But I am enabled to &s;olve this difficult mat|ter,
and to deduce it from an immediate cau&s;e.
We have already &s;een, that the terre&s;trial globe,
when it fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed its form, was in a &s;tate
of fluidity, and that the water being unable to
di&s;&s;olve terre&s;trial bodies, this fluidity was a
liquefaction occa&s;ioned by fire. Now, to pa&s;s
from this burning and liquified &s;tate to a mild
and temperate heat, time was nece&s;&s;ary. The
globe could not at once cool to its pre&s;ent tem|perature.
Thus, during the fir&s;t ages after its
formation, the heat proper to the earth was in|finitely
greater than that which it received
from the &s;un; &s;ince it is &s;till much greater.
This immen&s;e fire being afterwards gradually
di&s;&s;ipated, the polar, like all other climates, un|derwent
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes from heat to cold.
<PB N="286" REF="293">
Of cour&s;e, a certain time, or rather a long tract of
time, exi&s;ted, during which the northern re|gions,
after having burnt like all others, enjoyed
the &s;ame heat which at pre&s;ent is felt in the
&s;outhern climates. Hence the&s;e northern coun|tries
might and actually have been inhabited
by animals now peculiar to the &s;outh, and to
whom this degree of heat is indi&s;pen&s;ible.
The fact, therefore, in&s;tead of being extraordi|nary,
perfectly accords with the other facts,
and is no more than a con&s;equence of them.
In&s;tead of oppo&s;ing my theory of the earth,
this fact, on the contrary, is an acce&s;&s;ory proof
of its reality, and confirms the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
point I have advanced; <HI>i. e.</HI> when we attempt
to look back into that profundity of time
when the light of genius is apt to extingui&s;h
it&s;elf, and when, for want of ob&s;ervations,
genius has no aid to lead us to a more remote
period.</P>
<P>A &s;ixth epoch, po&s;terior to the other five, is
that when the two Continents were &s;eparated
from each other. It is certain, that they were
not &s;eparated when the elephants lived equal|ly
in the north of Europe, A&s;ia, and America;
I &s;ay, equally; for we find their bones in Si|beria,
in Ru&s;&s;ia, and in Canada. Hence the
&s;eparation of the two Continents happened po|&s;terior
to the abode of the&s;e animals in the
northern regions. But, as we likewi&s;e find the
<PB N="287" REF="294">
tu&s;ks of the elephant in Poland, in Germany,
in France, and in Italy, we mu&s;t conclude,
that, in proportion as the&s;e northern regions
cooled, the elephants retired toward the tem|perate
zone, where the heat of the &s;un, and
the greater thickne&s;s of the globe, compen|&s;ated
the lo&s;s of the earth's internal heat; and
that, in the progre&s;s of time, the temperate
zone having al&s;o become too cold, the elephant
gradually migrated to the climates under the
Torrid Zone, which alone have longe&s;t pre&s;er|ved,
by the greater thickne&s;s of the globe, a
&s;uperior degree of internal heat. The&s;e are
likewi&s;e the only climates where this interior
heat, united with that of the &s;un, is &s;till &s;uffi|cient
to &s;upport their exi&s;tence, and to permit
them to propagate their &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Independent of the &s;pecimens tran&s;mitted
from Ru&s;&s;ia and Siberia, and which are pre&s;er|ved
in the Royal cabinet, there are many others
in private collections. Va&s;t numbers of them
are to be &s;een in the mu&s;aeum of Peter&s;burg, as
appears from a catalogue printed in the year
1742. There are likewi&s;e many of them in the
Briti&s;h mu&s;aeum, in that of Copenhagen, and
in &s;ome other collections in Britain, Germany,
and Italy. This northern ivory, like the &s;ou|thern,
is u&s;ed in manufacturing many articles of
hardware, &amp;c. Hence the great quantity of
the tu&s;ks and bones of elephants found in Sibe|ria
<PB N="288" REF="295">
and Ru&s;&s;ia can no longer remain a doubtful
point.</P>
<P>M. Pallas, a learned naturali&s;t, in his late
journey through Siberia, found a great quantity
of elephants bones, and an entire &s;keleton of a
rhinoceros, which was buried a few feet only
under the &s;urface of the ground.</P>
<P>'Enormous bones of the elephant were late|ly
di&s;covered at Swijatoki, &s;eventeen ver&s;ts
from Peter&s;burg: They were found in a &s;pot
which had long been covered with water.
Hence &s;ome prodigious revolution mu&s;t have
changed the climate, the productions, and the
animals, in every quarter of the globe. The&s;e
medals of Nature prove, that tho&s;e countries
which are now de&s;olated by the rigours of
inten&s;e cold, have formerly enjoyed all the ad|vantages
of the &s;outhern latitudes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal de Politique et de Literature, 5. Jan. 1776, art. <HI>Peter&s;bourg.</HI></NOTE>.'</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The di&s;covery of the tu&s;ks and &s;keletons of
elephants in Canada is but recent; and I was
fir&s;t informed of them by a letter from the late
Mr Colli&s;on, fellow of the Royal Society of
London, of which the following is a tran&s;la|tion.</P>
<P>'Mr George Croghan has a&s;&s;ured me, that,
in the cour&s;e of his travels through the coun|tries
bordering upon the river Ohio, in the
year 1765 and 1766, about four miles &s;outh-ea&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="296">
from this river, and 640 miles di&s;tant
from Fort du Que&s;ne or Pit&s;burgh, he &s;aw, in
the neighbourhood of a large &s;alt mar&s;h, where
the wild animals a&s;&s;emble at certain &s;ea&s;ons of
the year, immen&s;e bones and teeth. Having
carefully examined the place, he di&s;covered,
in a high bank on the &s;ide of the mar&s;h, a
prodigious number of bones, which, from
their figure and magnitude, appeared to be
the bones and tu&s;ks of elephants.'</P>
<P>'But, Sir, the large grinding teeth which I
&s;end you, were found along with the&s;e tu&s;ks.
There are others &s;till larger than the&s;e, which
&s;eem to indicate, and even to demon&s;trate,
that they belong not to elephants. How &s;hall
we reconcile this paradox? May we not &s;up|po&s;e,
that there formerly exi&s;ted a large ani|mal
which had the tu&s;ks of an elephant and
the grinders of the hippopotamus? for the&s;e
large grinders are very different from tho&s;e of
the elephant. From the great number of tu&s;ks
and grinders which he &s;aw, Mr Croghan thinks,
that there mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t thirty of
the&s;e animals buried in this place. Elephants,

<HEAD>Extract from a Journal of a voyage made by Mr
Croghan on the river Ohio, and tran&s;mitted to
Dr Franklin in the month of May 1765.</HEAD>
<P>'Having pa&s;&s;ed the great river Miame, we
arrived, in the evening, at the place where the
bones of elephants are found. It is about 640
miles from Fort Pitt. In the morning, I
went to the large mar&s;h where the wild ani|mals
a&s;&s;emble at certain times of the year.
We came to this place by a road beaten with
the feet of the wild oxen, or bi&s;ons. It is a|bout
four miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from the river Ohio.
We &s;aw a great number of bones, &s;ome of
them &s;cattered about, and others buried five or
&s;ix feet below the &s;urface. We &s;aw them in a
bank of earth along the &s;ide of the road. We
found two tu&s;ks of &s;ix feet in length, which
we carried to our hut, along with other bones
and teeth. The following year we returned
<PB N="292" REF="299">
to the &s;ame place, in order to procure a great|er
number of tu&s;ks and teeth.'</P>
<P>'I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> M. de Buffon had any queries to make

parts, who will be happy to an&s;wer every
que&s;tion.' This little Memoir was &s;ubjoined
to the letter which I have ju&s;t now quoted, and
to which I &s;hall add an extract of what Mr Col|lin&s;on
formerly wrote me concerning the&s;e A|merican
bones.</P>
<P>'About a mile and a half from the river Ohio,
there are &s;ix enormous &s;keletons buried on end,
with tu&s;ks from five to &s;ix feet long, and of
the &s;ame form and &s;ub&s;tance as elephants tu&s;ks.
They were thirty inches in circumference at
the root. They tapered to a point. But, as they
were broken, we could not perceive how they
were joined to the jaws. A thigh-bone of the
&s;ame animals was found entire. It weighed a
hundred pounds, and was four and a half feet
in length. The&s;e tu&s;ks and thigh-bones &s;how
that the animal mu&s;t have been of a prodigious
magnitude. The&s;e facts have been confirmed
by Mr Greenwood, who &s;aw the &s;ix &s;keletons
in the &s;alt-mar&s;h. In the &s;ame place, he like|wi&s;e
found large grinders, which appeared not
to belong to the elephant, but rather to the
hippopotamus. Some of the&s;e teeth he &s;ent to

weighed 9&frac14; pounds. He &s;ays, that the jaw|bone
was too heavy to be carried by two men.
The interval between the orbits of the two
eyes was eighteen inches. An Engli&s;hman,
who had been taken pri&s;oner by the &s;avages,
and conducted to this &s;alt-mar&s;h in order to
teach them how to make &s;alt by evaporating
the water, declared, that, from a peculiar cir|cum&s;tance,
he remembered to have &s;een the&s;e
enormous bones. He told, that three French|men,

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Some time after writing the&s;e letters, Mr
Collin&s;on read to the Royal Society of London
two &s;hort e&s;&s;ays on the &s;ame &s;ubject, in which I
found &s;ome new facts, which I &s;hall relate, and
add elucidations of &s;uch things as may require
explanation.</P>
<P>'The &s;alt-mar&s;h where the elephants bones
are found is about four miles di&s;tant from the
banks of the river Ohio; but it is more than
&s;even hundred miles from the neare&s;t coa&s;t of
the &s;ea. There is a road beaten by the wild
oxen, or bi&s;ons, large enough to allow two
chariots to travel abrea&s;t. This road directly
leads to the great &s;alt-mar&s;h where the&s;e ani|mals,
as well as &s;tags and other &s;pecies of the
deer, a&s;&s;emble at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year
to lick the earth and drink the &s;alt water. . . . .
<PB N="294" REF="301">
The elephants bones are found in a bank of
about &s;ix or &s;even feet high, which &s;urrounds
the mar&s;h. There we &s;ee teeth and bones
which had formerly belonged to &s;ome animals
of a prodigious &s;ize. Some of the tu&s;ks are
near &s;even feet in length, and con&s;i&s;t of excel|lent
ivory; and therefore we cannot entertain
any doubt that they really belong to the ele|phant
&s;pecies. It is &s;ingular, however, that,
among the&s;e tu&s;ks, we never meet with a &s;in|gle
grinder of an elephant, but a va&s;t number
of enormous teeth, each of which has five or
&s;ix blunt knobs, and mu&s;t have belonged to
&s;ome animal of an immen&s;e &s;ize. The&s;e &s;quare
teeth have no re&s;emblance to the grinders of
the elephant, which are flat, and four or five
times broader than thick; &s;o that the&s;e e|normous
grinders have no re&s;emblance to the
teeth of any known animal.'</P>
<P>This la&s;t remark of Mr Collin&s;on is extremely
ju&s;t: The&s;e large grinders are totally different
from tho&s;e of the elephant; and, by comparing
them with the grinders of the hippopotamus,
which they re&s;emble by their &s;quare figure, we
&s;hall perceive that they likewi&s;e differ in &s;ize,
as they are two, three, and even four times
more voluminous than the large&s;t teeth of the
ancient hippopotami found in Siberia and Ca|nada,
though the&s;e la&s;t teeth are three or four
times larger than tho&s;e of the hippopotami
<PB N="295" REF="302">
which now exi&s;t. All the teeth which I have
examined in four heads of the&s;e animals pre|&s;erved
in the Royal Cabinet, have the grinding
&s;ide hollowed in the form of a card-&s;pade, and
tho&s;e found in Canada and Siberia have the &s;ame
character, and differ from them in &s;ize only.
But tho&s;e enormous teeth with large blunt knobs
have always four and &s;ometimes five rows;
whil&s;t the large&s;t teeth of the hippopotamus have
only three, as may be &s;een by comparing the
figures of plate CII. CIV. and CV. with tho&s;e of
plate CVI. It &s;eems, therefore, to be certain, that
the&s;e large teeth have never belonged either to
the elephant or to the hippopotamus: The differ|ence
in &s;ize, though enormous, would not pre|vent
us from regarding them as pertaining to
this la&s;t &s;pecies, if all the characters in their
form were the &s;ame; &s;ince we know, as for|merly
remarked, other &s;quare teeth three or
four times larger than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent ex|i&s;ting
hippopotami, and which, having the pre|ci&s;e
&s;ame characters, are unque&s;tionably the
teeth of hippopotami that have been three times
larger than tho&s;e who&s;e heads are in the Royal
Cabinet. I meant tho&s;e large teeth, which real|ly
belong to the hippopotamus, when I remark|ed,
that they were equally found in both Con|tinents,
as well as the tu&s;ks of the elephant.
It is remarkable, however, that we not only
find real tu&s;ks of the elephant, and real teeth of
<PB N="296" REF="303">
the large hippopotamus, in Siberia and Canada,
but we likewi&s;e find in the &s;ame countries tho&s;e
enormous teeth with four rows of large blunt
knobs. We may, therefore, conclude, that this
immen&s;e animal no longer exi&s;ts, and that the
&s;pecies is entirely extinct.</P>
<P>M. l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Compte de Vergennes, mini&s;ter and &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate, was &s;o obliging as to give me, in
the year 1770, the large&s;t of all the&s;e teeth, which
is repre&s;ented in plates CII. and CIII.; it weigh|ed
eleven pounds four ounces. This immen&s;e
tooth was di&s;covered in making a ditch in Little
Tartary. There were other bones which could
not be collected, and, among the&s;e, a thigh-bone,
of which one half only was entire, and the ca|vity
of this half contained fifteen Paris pints of
water. M. l'Abb&eacute; Chappe, of the Academy
of &s;ciences, brought me from Siberia a &s;imilar
tooth, but &s;maller, and which weighed only three
pounds twelve and a half ounces. (Plate CIV. fig.
1. and 2.) La&s;tly, the large&s;t of tho&s;e tran&s;mit|ted
to me by Mr Collin&s;on, and which is repre|&s;ented,
(plate CV.) was found, among &s;everal o|thers,
near the river Ohio in America; and they
pertectly re&s;emble other &s;pecimens brought
from Canada.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e facts it is apparent, that, inde|pendent
of the elephant and hippopotamus,
who&s;e relicks are equally found in the two con|tinents,
another animal common to both has
<PB N="297" REF="304">
formerly exi&s;ted, the &s;ize of which has greatly
exceeded that of the large&s;t elephants; for the
&s;quare form of the&s;e enormous grinders &s;hows,
that they were numerous in each jaw; and &s;up|po&s;ing
there were only &s;ix or even four in each
&s;ide of the jaws, we may form &s;ome notion of
the magnitude of a head which could contain
&s;ixteen grinders, each weighing ten or eleven
pounds. The elephant has only four grinders,
two on each &s;ide. They are flat, and occupy
the whole jaw; and the&s;e two flat grinders of
the elephant &s;urpa&s;s by two inches only the
breadth of the large&s;t &s;quare tooth of the un|known
animal, which is double the thickne&s;s
of tho&s;e of the elephant. Thus every cicum|&s;tance
leads us to think, that this ancient &s;pecies,
which ought to be regarded as the large&s;t of all
terre&s;trial animals, exi&s;ted during the fir&s;t ages
only; for an animal much larger than the ele|phant
could not be &s;o concealed in any part
of the earth as to remain perfectly unknown.
Be&s;ides, it is evident, from the figure of the&s;e
teeth, as well as from the enamel, and the di&s;po&s;i|tion
of their roots, that they have no relation to
the teeth of the cetaceous tribes; and that they
have really belonged to a land-animal who&s;e
&s;pecies made a nearer approach to that of the
hippopotamus than to any other.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his e&s;&s;ay. Mr Collin&s;on in|forms
us, that &s;everal members of the Royal
<PB N="298" REF="305">
Society were equally well acquainted with the
elephants tu&s;ks daily found in Siberia, upon the
banks of the Oby, and other rivers of that coun|try.
What &s;y&s;tem, he adds, can be formed,
which will, with any degree of probability, ac|count
for tho&s;e bones of the elephant found in
Siberia and in America? He concludes with enu|merating
the weight and dimen&s;ions of all the
teeth brought from the &s;alt-mar&s;h near the river
Ohio, the large&s;t of which belonged to Captain
Ourry, and weighed &s;ix pounds and a half.</P>
<P>Mr Collin&s;on, in his &s;econd e&s;&s;ay, read before
the Royal Society of London December 10. 1767,
remarks, that, as one of the tu&s;ks found in the
&s;alt-mar&s;h was &s;triated or furrowed near the
thicke&s;t end, he entertained &s;ome doubts whether
the&s;e furrows were peculiar to the elephant &s;pecies.
To &s;atisfy him&s;elf on this head, he vi&s;ited the
warehou&s;e of a merchant who dealt in all kinds
of teeth; and, after examining them, he di&s;co|vered
that there were as many tu&s;ks furrowed
as &s;mooth at the thick end; and, of cour&s;e, he
had no difficulty in pronouncing, that the tu&s;ks
found in America were, in every re&s;pect, &s;imi|lar
to tho&s;e of the African and A&s;iatic elephants.
But, as the large American &s;quare teeth have
no relation to the grinders of the elephant, he
thinks, that they are the remains of &s;ome enor|mous
animal which had tu&s;ks like an elephant,
and grinders peculiar to its own &s;pecies, their
<PB N="299" REF="306">
magnitude and form being totally different from
tho&s;e of any known animal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. 1767.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1748, M. Fabri, who had made
great excur&s;ions into the northern parts of Loui|&s;iana
and the &s;outhern regions of Canada, in|formed
me, that he had &s;een heads and &s;kele|tons
of an enormous quadruped, called by the
Savages the <HI>father of Oxen</HI>; and that the thigh|bones
of the&s;e animals were from five to &s;ix
feet in length. Some time after, and previous
to the year 1767 &s;pecimens of the&s;e large teeth
belonging to the unknown animal, as well as
tho&s;e of the hippopotamus, and bones of the e|lephant,
all found in America, were tran&s;mitted
to Paris. The number of them is too con&s;ide|rable
to leave any doubt that the&s;e animals for|merly
exi&s;ted in the northern regions of Ame|rica,
as well as in tho&s;e of Europe and A&s;ia.</P>
<P>But elephants have likewi&s;e exi&s;ted in all the
temperate countries of our Continent. I men|tioned
tu&s;ks found in Languedoc near Simore,
and tho&s;e di&s;covered in Cominges in Ga&s;cony.
To the&s;e I &s;hall add the large&s;t and fine&s;t of the
whole, lately &s;ent to the Royal Cabinet by the
Duc de la Rochefoucauld, who&s;e zeal for pro|moting
&s;cience is a re&s;ult of his general know|ledge.
This excellent &s;pecimen he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">found, a|long
with M. De&s;marets of the Academy of Sci|ences,
<PB N="300" REF="307">
when viewing the fields in the environs
of Rome. This tu&s;k was divided into five frag|ments,
which the Duc de la Rochfoucauld or|dered
to be collected. One of the&s;e fragments
was &s;tolen by the porter who had the charge of
it, and there remained only four, which were
about eight inches in diameter. When laid to|gether,
the&s;e four fragments were &s;even feet
in length; and we learn from M. De&s;marets,
that the fifth fragment, which was lo&s;t, was
near three feet long. Hence the total length
of the tu&s;k mu&s;t have been about ten feet. By
examining the broken ends, we di&s;covered eve|ry
character of elephantine ivory; though, by
being long buried under ground, it has become
light and friable, like all other fo&s;&s;il ivories.</P>
<P>M. Tozzetti, a learned Italian naturali&s;t, re|lates,
that there were found, in the valleys of
Arno, the bones of elephants and other terre&s;|trial
animals in great quantities, &s;cattered here
and there in the &s;trata of the earth. We may,
therefore, he remarks, conclude, that elephants
were formerly natives of Europe, and e&s;pecially
of Tu&s;cany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'une lettre du Docteur Tozzetti, Journal &eacute;tran|ger, mois de Decembre 1755.</NOTE>.</P>

In the &s;ame manner, we find in France, and
in all the other nations of Europe, &s;keletons and
vertebrae of marine animals, which can only
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in the mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;eas. The &s;ame
change of temperature, therefore, has happened
in the various parts of the ocean as well as in
tho&s;e of the land; and this &s;econd fact, like the
fir&s;t, as it proceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;e, con|firms
the whole.</P>
<P>When we compare tho&s;e ancient monuments
of the fir&s;t age of animated nature with her ac|tual
productions, we evidently perceive that the
con&s;tituent form of each animal has remained
the &s;ame, and that there is no alteration in the
principal parts of their &s;tructure. The type of
each &s;pecies has &s;uffered no change. The inter|nal
mould has invariably pre&s;erved its form.
However long we may &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
time, whatever number of generations may have
pa&s;&s;ed, the individuals of each kind &s;till exhibit
the &s;ame forms as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t ages, e&s;pe|cially
in the larger &s;pecies, who&s;e characters are
more fixed, and who&s;e nature is more permanent;
for the inferior &s;pecies have, as formerly re|marked,
been &s;en&s;ibly affected by the dif|ferent
cau&s;es of degeneration. We mu&s;t, how|ever,
remark, with regard to the larger &s;pecies,
&s;uch as the elephant and hippopotamus, that, by
comparing their ancient remains with tho&s;e of
our times, we, in general, perceive that the&s;e a|nimals
<PB N="303" REF="310">
were then much larger than they are at
pre&s;ent. Nature was then in her primitive vi|gour.
The internal heat of the earth be&s;towed
on its productions all the vigour and magnitude
of which they were &s;u&s;ceptible. The fir&s;t ages
produced giants of every kind. Dwarfs and
pigmies &s;ucceeded, after the earth had cooled;
and if, as other monuments &s;eems to indicate,
&s;ome &s;pecies of animals, which formerly exi&s;ted,
are now lo&s;t, this effect could only be produced,
becau&s;e their nature required a greater degree of
heat than what is now felt in the torrid zone.
Tho&s;e enormous and nearly &s;quare grinders with
blunt knobs, tho&s;e large cornua ammonis, of
which &s;ome are &s;everal feet in diameter, and
many other fo&s;&s;il fi&s;hes and &s;hells, which no
longer have any living repre&s;entatives, exi&s;ted
only in tho&s;e primitive times when the earth
and &s;ea were &s;till warm, and produced and nou|ri&s;hed
animals to whom this degree of heat was
nece&s;&s;ary, and who exi&s;t not at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e
they have probably peri&s;hed by cold.</P>
<P>To know all the petrifactions of which there
are no living repre&s;entatives, would require long
&s;tudy and an exact compari&s;on of the various
&s;pecies of petrified bodies, which have been
found in the bowels of the earth. This &s;ci|ence
is &s;till in its infancy. We are certain,
however, that there are many of tho&s;e &s;pecies,
&s;uch as, the cornua ammonis, ortoceratites, len|ticular
<PB N="304" REF="311">
and numi&s;mal &s;tones, belemnites, Judaic
&s;tones, anthropomorphites, &amp;c. which cannot
be referred to any &s;pecies now exi&s;ting. We
have &s;een cornua ammonis of two and three feet
in diameter; and we have been a&s;&s;ured by men
worthy of credit, that a cornua ammonis has been
found in Champagne larger than a mill-&s;tone,
&s;ince it was eight feet in diameter and one foot
thick. I had an offer of its being &s;ent to me.
But the enormous weight of this ma&s;s, which
is 8000 pounds, and its great di&s;tance from Pa|ris,
prevented me from accepting the pre&s;ent.
The&s;e examples, and others which might be
given, are &s;ufficient to &s;how, that many &s;pecies
of &s;hell and cru&s;taceous animals formerly exi&s;t|ed
in the &s;ea, of which there are now no living
repre&s;entatives. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is ap|plicable
to &s;ome of the &s;caly fi&s;hes. Mo&s;t of
tho&s;e found in certain &s;lates have &s;o little re&s;em|blance
to the fi&s;hes with which we are acquaint|ed,
that their &s;pecies cannot be a&s;certained. E|ven
tho&s;e in the Royal Cabinet, which are per|fectly
pre&s;erved in ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone, cannot be re|ferred
to any of our known &s;pecies. It appears,
therefore, that the &s;ea formerly nouri&s;hed ma|ny
genera, who&s;e &s;pecies no longer exi&s;t.</P>
<P>But, with regard to terre&s;trial animals, we
have only a &s;ingle example of a lo&s;t &s;pecies,
and it appears to have been the large&s;t, without
excepting even the elephant: And, &s;ince the
<PB N="305" REF="312">
examples of lo&s;t &s;pecies are more rare in land
than in marine animals, is it not probable, that
the production of the former was po&s;terior to
that of the latter?</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts and monuments we may
perceive &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive epochs in the fir&s;t ages of
Nature; &s;ix &s;pecies of duration, the limits of

The&s;e epochs are purely hypothetical, and
depend more or le&s;s on the notion, that the
earth and planets were originally driven from
the body of the &s;un by the impul&s;e of a comet,
and, of cour&s;e, remained long in a &s;tate of li|quid
fire. We &s;hall therefore content our&s;elves
with having barely mentioned them, and pro|ceed
to enumerate &s;ome facts and po&s;itions,
which, though applied in &s;upport of a fanciful
&s;y&s;tem, are curious, and may be u&s;eful.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The Count de Buffon remarks, that the ca|vities
and eminences of the globe have been en|cru&s;ted,
and &s;ometimes filled with metallic &s;ub|&s;tances,
which are &s;till found in the&s;e &s;ituations.</P>
<P>'Metallic veins,' &s;ays M. Eller, 'are found
only in elevated places, in a long chain of
mountains. This chain of mountains is al|ways
&s;upported by a ba&s;is of hard rock. As
long as this rock pre&s;erves its continuity, there
is no chance of di&s;covering metallic veins.
But, when we meet with crevices or fi&s;&s;ures,
we then entertain hopes of finding metal.
Mineralogi&s;ts have remarked, that, in Ger|many,
the mo&s;t favourable &s;ituation is when
the mountains ri&s;e gradually, &s;tretch toward
the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and, after attaining their
greate&s;t elevation, de&s;cend gently toward the
north we&s;t. . . .'</P>
<P>'It is generally in a rugged rock, the extent
of which is often unlimited, but &s;plit into
<PB N="308" REF="315">
fi&s;&s;ures, that metals are found &s;ometimes pure,
but generally in the &s;tate of ores. The&s;e fi&s;|&s;ures
are commonly encru&s;ted with a white
&s;hining &s;ub&s;tance called <HI>quartz</HI> by the miners:
When heavier, but &s;oft and laminated nearly
like chalk, it receives the denomination of
<HI>&s;par.</HI> It is &s;urrounded, on the &s;ide next the
rock, with a kind of &s;lime, which &s;eems to
nouri&s;h the&s;e quartzy or &s;parry earths. The&s;e
two coverings &s;erve as a &s;heath for the vein.
The more perpendicular the vein, the more is
to be expected from it. Whenever the miners
find a perpendicular vein, they &s;ay that it
will be very productive.'</P>
<P>'In the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures and cavities, metals are form|ed
by a perpetual and pretty &s;trong evaporation.
The vapours which i&s;&s;ue from mines &s;how
that this evaporation is &s;till going on. Fi&s;&s;ures
which have no exhalation are commonly bar|ren
of metal. The mo&s;t certain proof that the
exhaling vapours carry along with them mi|neral
particles, and apply them to the &s;ides of
the fi&s;&s;ures, is that &s;ucce&s;&s;ive encru&s;tation which
is apparent in the whole circumference of
the&s;e fi&s;&s;ures or hollows of rocks, till their ca|vities
are completely filled, and the &s;olid vein
is formed. This fact is &s;till farther confirmed
by the tools left in the&s;e hollows; and, &s;everal
years after, they are found to be encru&s;ted
with metal.'</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="316">
'The fi&s;&s;ures which furni&s;h the mo&s;t rich
veins of metal always incline to a perpendicular
direction. In proportion as the miners de|&s;cend,
the temperature of the air is always
warmer; and the exhalations are &s;ometimes &s;o
abundant, and &s;o noxious, that, in order to
avoid &s;uffocation, the miners are obliged to
fly to the pits or galleries, otherwi&s;e they
would be in&s;tantly de&s;troyed by the ar&s;enical
and &s;ulphureous particles. Sulphur and ar&s;enic
are commonly found in the four imperfect,
and in all the &s;emimetals, and it is from the&s;e
they receive their metallic form.'</P>
<P>'Gold, and &s;ometimes &s;ilver and copper, are
the only metals which are found pure in any
quantities. But, in general, copper, iron,
lead, and tin, when taken out of the veins,
are mineralized with &s;ulphur and ar&s;enic. We
know from experience, that metals lo&s;e their
metallic form by degrees of heat proportioned
to each &s;pecies. This de&s;truction of the metal|lic
form, which the four imperfect metals under|go,
&s;hows that the ba&s;is of metals is an ear|thy
matter; and, as the&s;e calces, as well as the
calcarious and gyp&s;eous earths, vitrify by the
application of a certain degree of heat, we
are certain that metallic earth belongs to the
cla&s;s of vitrifiable earths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. de M. Eller &s;ur l'origine et la generation des Me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aux.</NOTE>.'</P>

M. Lehman, a celebrated chymi&s;t, is the fir&s;t
per&s;on who &s;u&s;pected that metallic &s;ub&s;tances had
a double origin. 'Gold and &s;ilver,' he remarks,
'are found in ma&s;&s;es only in the mountains
which have veins, and iron is found only in
tho&s;e mountains which have regular &s;trata.
All the &s;mall pieces of gold and &s;ilver found
in the mountains with &s;trata have been detach|ed
from veins in the &s;uperior mountains in
the neighbourhood of the former.'</P>
<P>'Gold is never in the form of ore. It is al|ways
found in a native or virgin &s;tate, though
it is often &s;cattered about in particles &s;o mi|nute,
that it cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed even by
the be&s;t micro&s;copes. In the mountains with
&s;trata, no gold, and very little &s;ilver, are to be
found. The&s;e two metals belong exclu&s;ively
to mountains with veins. Sometimes, how|ever,
we find &s;ilver in &s;mall leaves, or under
the form of hair, in &s;late. Native copper of|tener
occurs in &s;late; and this copper is al&s;o
commonly in the form of threads or hair.'</P>
<P>'A few years after iron-ores have been ta|ken
from the earth, they are reproduced.
They are not found in the mountains with
veins, but in tho&s;e with &s;trata. Iron is &s;el|dom,
if ever, met with in a native &s;tate.'</P>
<P>'With regard to native tin, it has no exi&s;t|ence
in Nature, and is only produced by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fire. The &s;ame remark is appli|cable
<PB N="311" REF="318">
to lead, though the grains found in Sile|&s;ia
have been con&s;idered as native lead.'</P>
<P>'Native mercury is found in &s;trata of fat ar|gillaceous
earth, or in &s;late.'</P>
<P>'The &s;ilver ores found in &s;late are not nearly
&s;o rich as tho&s;e found in the mountains with
veins. This metal is found in beds of &s;late;
and is always in the form of minute particles,
threads, or ramifications, but never appears in
large ma&s;&s;es. The&s;e beds of &s;late mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
be adjacent to the mountains with veins.
The &s;ilver-ores found in &s;trata are never in a
&s;olid or compact form. All the other ores,
which contain much &s;ilver, are peculiar to the
mountains with veins. There is a great deal
of &s;ilver in the &s;trata of &s;late; and it is al&s;o
&s;ometimes found in pit-coal.'</P>
<P>'Tin is the metal which mo&s;t rarely appears
in &s;trata; lead is more common in that &s;itua|tion.
We find it attached to &s;late, but never
to coal.'</P>
<P>'Iron is almo&s;t univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, and is
found in beds under a number of different
forms.'</P>
<P>'Cinnabar, cobalt, bi&s;muth, and lapis cala|minaris,
are likewi&s;e commonly found in beds.'</P>
<P>'Pit-coal, jett, amber, and aluminous earth,
are produced by vegetables, and e&s;pecially by
re&s;inous trees which have been buried in the
earth, and have been more or le&s;s decom|po&s;ed;
<PB N="312" REF="319">
for we often find, above the &s;trata of
coal, wood which is not totally decompo&s;ed; and
it is &s;till more decompo&s;ed as we de&s;cend deep|er.
Slate, which covers coal, is often full of the
impre&s;&s;ions of plants, &s;uch as ferns, maiden|hair,
&amp;c. It is remarkable, that all the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions
belong to foreign plants, and the wood
likewi&s;e appears to be foreign. Amber, which
ought to be regarded as a vegetable re&s;in, often
includes in&s;ects, which, when attentively ex|amined,
belong not to the climate where they
now exi&s;t. Aluminous earth is frequently la|minated,
and re&s;embles wood &s;ometimes more
and &s;ometimes le&s;s decompo&s;ed.'</P>
<P>'Sulphur, alum, and &s;al ammoniac, are found
in beds formed by volcano's.'</P>
<P>'Petroleum and naphtha indicate a &s;ubterra|neous
fire, which produces a di&s;tillation from
pit-coal. We have examples of the&s;e &s;ubter|raneous
fires which act &s;ilently, in the coal
&s;trata of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">tain and Germany. They burn
long without any explo&s;ion; and it is in the
neighbourhood of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous fires
that hot &s;prings are found.'</P>
<P>'The mountains which contain veins include
neither coal nor bituminous and combu&s;tible
bodies: The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are found only in the
mountains with &s;trata.'</P>
<P>In the &s;econd epoch of Nature, the Count
de Buffon remarks, 'that, in the northern re|gions
<PB N="313" REF="320">
there are mountains compo&s;ed entirely
of iron.' I mention, &s;ays he, by way of ex|ample,
the iron mines near Taberg in Smoland,
a part of the i&s;land of Gothland in Sweden.
It is the mo&s;t remarkable of tho&s;e mines, or ra|ther
mountains of iron which have the quality
of yielding to the attraction of the load-&s;tone;
which proves that they have been formed by
the action of fire. The ba&s;is of this mountain
is a very fine &s;and. Its height is more than
400 feet, and its circumference about one league.
It is compo&s;ed entirely of a rich ferruginous
matter, and we even find in it native iron, which
is another proof that it has undergone the ac|tion
of a violent fire. This ore, when broken,
exhibits &s;mall &s;hining particles, which &s;ometimes
cro&s;s each other, and &s;ometimes are arranged
like &s;cales. This mine has been wrought above
two hundred years.</P>
<P>The ore in this mountain is not di&s;po&s;ed in
regular beds; neither is the iron every where of
equal goodne&s;s. Through the whole mountain
there are fi&s;&s;&s;ures &s;ometimes perpendicular, and
&s;ometimes horizontal: The&s;e are all filled with
&s;and, which contains no iron. This &s;and is
pure, and of the &s;ame &s;pecies with that on the
&s;ea-coa&s;t. In this &s;and, we &s;ometimes find the
bones of animals, and the horns of &s;tags, which
&s;hows that the &s;and has been carried thither by
the waters, and that the formation of this iron
<PB N="314" REF="321">
mountain by fire happened before the crevices
and the perpendicular and horizontal fi&s;&s;ures
were filled with &s;and.</P>
<P>The ma&s;&s;es of ore are rolled down from the
top of the mountain; but, in other mines, the
minerals mu&s;t be drawn up from the bowels of
the earth. This o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t be broken to pieces,
or pounded, before it is put into the furnace,
where it is &s;melted by means of charcoal and cal|carious
&s;tones.</P>

<P>We are next informed, that there are moun|tains
of load-&s;tone in &s;ome countries, and parti|cularly
in tho&s;e of the North. From the fore|going
example, we have &s;een that the iron
mountain of Taberg ri&s;es 400 feet above the le|vel
of the &s;ea. M. Gmelin, in his travels through
Siberia, remarks, that, in the northern coun|tries
of A&s;ia, almo&s;t all the metallic ores are
found on the &s;urface of the earth, whil&s;t in o|ther
countries they are buried deep in the inte|rior
parts of the earth. This fact, if generally
true, is a new proof that metals have been form|ed
by the primitive fire, and that the globe be|ing
<PB N="315" REF="322">
le&s;s thick in the northern regions, metals
were formed nearer the &s;urface than in the &s;ou|thern
countries.</P>
<P>M. Gmelin examined the great mountain of
load&s;tone among the Ba&s;chkires in Siberia.
This mountain is divided into eight parts by
valleys, of which the &s;eventh part produces the
be&s;t load&s;tone. The &s;ummit of this portion of
the mountain con&s;i&s;ts of a yellowi&s;h &s;tone, which
&s;eems to partake of the nature of ja&s;per. We
there find &s;tones that have the appearance of
free-&s;tone, which weight from two to three
thou&s;and pounds; but they all have a magne|tic
virtue. Though covered with mo&s;s, they
fail not, at more than the di&s;tance of an inch,
to attract iron and &s;teel. The &s;ides expo&s;ed to
the air have the &s;tronge&s;t magnetic power, tho&s;e
covered with the earth being much weaker.
Tho&s;e parts which are expo&s;ed to the injuries of
the air are &s;ofter, and, con&s;equently, le&s;s pro|per
for being armed. A large portion of load|&s;tone,
of the &s;ize above mentioned, is compo&s;ed
of a number of other portions which act in dif|ferent
directions. To work them properly,
they &s;hould be &s;eparated in &s;uch a manner that
the whole portion, which includes the virtue of
each particular magnet, &s;hould pre&s;erve its uni|ty:
By ob&s;erving this rule, we would probably
obtain magnets of an uncommon &s;trength. But,
as they are cut without any fore&s;ight, many
<PB N="316" REF="323">
portions are of no value, either becau&s;e they
contain little no magnetic power, or becau&s;e,
in a &s;ingle piece, there are two or three mag|nets
united: Such portions have indeed a mag|netic
virtue; but, as it is not directed to the
&s;ame point, a magnet of this kind mu&s;t be &s;ub|ject
to great variations.</P>
<P>The load&s;tone of this mountain, except what
is expo&s;ed to the air, is exceedingly hard, &s;pot|ted
with black, and full of little knots or protu|berances,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall angular parts, like
tho&s;e often ob&s;ervable on the &s;urface of blood|&s;tone,
from which it differs only in colour; but,
in&s;tead of the&s;e angular parts, we &s;ometimes per|ceive
a kind of ochrey earth. In general, load|&s;tones
with the&s;e angular parts have le&s;s power
than the other kinds. That part of the moun|tain
where the load&s;tones are found is compo&s;ed
almo&s;t entirely of a fine iron ore, which lies in
&s;mall portions among the load&s;tones. The
whole &s;ection of the high part of the mountain
contains a &s;imilar ore; but, in proportion as we
de&s;cend, the metal is more rare. Below the
ore of load&s;tone, there are other ferruginous
&s;tones, which, if melted, would produce very
little iron. The&s;e &s;tones have the colour of
metal, and are very heavy. Their interior
parts are irregular, and have nearly the appear|ance
of &s;coriae. In their &s;urfaces they pretty
much re&s;emble load&s;tones; but they have no
<PB N="317" REF="324">
magnetic power. Between the&s;e &s;tones there are
other pieces of rock which appear to be compo|&s;ed
of &s;mall particles of iron. The &s;tone it&s;elf
is heavy, but very &s;oft. The interior parts re|&s;emble
burned matter, and they have little or
no magnetic virtue. We likewi&s;e meet occa|&s;ionally
with a brown iron ore in beds of an
inch thick; but it yields very little metal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extrait d'Hi&s;t. generale des voyages, tom. 18. p. 141. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mountains of Poias in Siberia, there
are &s;everal other mines of load&s;tone. Ten
leagues off the road which leads from Catharin|bourg
to Salikam&s;kaia, there is a hill called <HI>Ga|lazin&s;ki,</HI>
which is more than twenty fathoms
high, and is entirely compo&s;ed of a load&s;tone
rock. It has the brown colour and the den&s;ity
of iron.</P>
<P>Twenty leagues from Salikam&s;kaia, we find
cubical load&s;tones of a brilliant greeni&s;h colour.
When pulveri&s;ed, the grains have the appear|ance
of fire. It is worthy of remark, that load|&s;tone
is found only in tho&s;e chains of mountains
which &s;tretch from &s;outh to north<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. tom. 19. p. 472.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the countries bordering upon Lapland, and
on the confines of Bothnia, two leagues di&s;tant
from Cokluanda, there is an iron-ore, from
which very fine load&s;tones are extracted. 'We
admired,' &s;ays Regnard, 'the &s;urpri&s;ing effects
<PB N="318" REF="325">
of this &s;tone, when it remained in its natural

the large hammer employed remained &s;o fixed
to the wedge in the &s;tone, that the workman
required a&s;&s;i&s;tance to di&s;engage it. I tried the
experiment my&s;elf; I took a large iron lever,
which was &s;o heavy that I could hardly &s;up|port
it; I brought it near the wedge by which
it was attracted and &s;upported with an ama|zing

above the &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Gentil, of the academy of Sciences, wrote me the following letter, in December 1771: 'Don Antonia Ulloa de&s;ired me, when departing from Cadiz, to &s;end him two petrified &s;hells, which, in the year 1761, he had dug out of the mountain that contains the quick &s;ilver mines. This mountain is in the government of Ouanca-Velica in Peru. Its &s;outhern latitude is from 13 to 14 degrees. At the place where the&s;e &s;hells are found, the mercury &s;tood at 17 inches 1&frac14; line, which corre&s;ponds to the height of 2222&frac13; fathoms above the level of the &s;ea.'
'At the top of the mountain, which is far from being the highe&s;t in this canton, the mercury &s;tands at 16&frac12; inches, which implies a height of 2337 2/8 fathoms.'
'In the town of Ouanca-Velica, the mercury &s;tands at 18 inches 1&frac12; line, which gives a height of 1949 fathoms.'
'Don Antonio Ulloa informed me, that he detached the&s;e &s;hells from a very thick bank, the extent of which he did not know: The &s;hells are of the large pilgrim or &s;callop kind.'</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, certain, that, in all the dif|ferent
parts of the world, and even to the height
of 1500 or 2000 fathoms above the pre&s;ent le|vel
<PB N="320" REF="327">
of the &s;ea, the &s;urface of the globe has been
covered with the waters, and that they remain|ed
long enough for the production and multi|plication
of &s;hell-animals; for the quantity of
them is &s;o great, that their &s;poils often form
large banks, which extend many miles in length.
They compo&s;e a con&s;iderable part of the exterior
&s;trata of the earth; for calcarious &s;ub&s;tances,
or the &s;poils of &s;hells, are very common in mo&s;t

granite, and other vitrifiable bodies produced
by the primitive fire, which contain no &s;hells,
madrepores, or any thing that has a relation to
calcarious &s;ub&s;tances. We may, therefore, con|clude,
that the &s;ea has never reached, or at lea&s;t
for a &s;hort time only, tho&s;e mo&s;t elevated parts
of the earth.</P>
<P>To &s;upport the te&s;timony of Don Ulloa, con|cerning
the &s;hells found in the Cordelieres, we
&s;hall add that of Alphon&s;o Barba. He tells us,
that, in the mo&s;t mountainous part of Peru, there
are &s;hells of all &s;izes, &s;ome of them concave, o|thers
convex, and the whole finely impre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Metallurgie d'Alphon&s;o Barba, tom. 1. p. 64.</NOTE>.
Hence America, as well as the other quarters of
the globe, has been covered with the waters of
the &s;ea. The fir&s;t ob&s;ervers were probably in|duced
to think that no &s;hells were to be found
<PB N="321" REF="328">
in the Cordelieres, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the&s;e moun|tains,
which are the highe&s;t on this globe, are
either active or extingui&s;hed volcano's, the e|ruptions
of which have covered all the adjacent
countries with burned &s;ub&s;tances: Of cour&s;e,
all the &s;hells which might have been found
there, are not only buried, but completely de|&s;troyed.
It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing that no
marine productions have been di&s;covered around
the&s;e mountains, which either are at pre&s;ent, or
have formerly been volcano's; for the ter|ritories
which &s;urround the&s;e mountains mu&s;t
be compo&s;ed entirely of a&s;hes, &s;coriae, gla&s;s, lava,
and other burned or vitrified bodies. Thus the
notion that the &s;ea never covered the mountains,
has no other foundation than this circum&s;tance,
that, on the tops of &s;everal of them, no &s;hells or
other productions of the &s;ea are now to be &s;een.
But, as we find, in an infinite number of pla|ces,
and even as high as 1500 or 2000 fathoms,
&s;hells and other &s;ea-bodies, it is evident, that
there are few ridges of mountains which have
not been covered with the ocean; and that the
&s;pots where no &s;hells appear only &s;how that the
animals which produce them have never dwelt
there, or that the motion of the waters has not
tran&s;ported thither marine productions, as it has
done in every other part of the globe.</P>

<P>We are next informed, that &s;ome fi&s;hes and
plants can live and vegetate in waters &s;o hot as
<PB N="322" REF="329">
from 50 to 60 degrees of the thermometer.
There are many examples of plants growing in
the hotte&s;t bath-waters; and M. Sonnerat found
fi&s;hes in water the heat of which was &s;o great
that he dur&s;t not plunge his hand into it. 'Two
leagues from Calamba,' &s;ays he, 'I found in
the i&s;le of Lu&ccedil;on, near the village of Bally, a
brook, the water of which was &s;o hot that
Reaumur's thermometer, when plunged into
it, about a league from its &s;ource, &s;tood at
the 69th degree. Upon perceiving &s;uch a
degree of heat, I imagined, that all the produc|tions
of nature mu&s;t have been extingui&s;hed
upon the margin of this brook. But I was
much &s;urpri&s;ed when I &s;aw three vigorous
&s;hrubs, the roots of which were immer&s;ed in
this boiling water, and their branches &s;ur|rounded
with its vapour. The heat was &s;o
great, that, when the &s;wallows attempted to
cro&s;s the water at &s;even or eight feet high, they u|niformly
fell down dead. One of the&s;e &s;hrubs
was an <HI>agnus ca&s;tus,</HI> the other two were a
&s;pecies of broom called <HI>a&s;palathus.</HI> During my
abode in this village, I con&s;tantly drank this wa|ter
after it was cooled. Its ta&s;te &s;eemed to be
earthy and ferruginous. Several baths are con|&s;tructed
along this brook, and their degrees of
heat are proportioned to their di&s;tance from its
&s;ource. When I vi&s;ited the fir&s;t bath, my
&s;urpri&s;e was increa&s;ed: In this water, which
<PB N="323" REF="330">
was &s;o hot that I dur&s;t not plunge my hand
into it, I &s;aw fi&s;hes &s;wimming. I u&s;ed every
effort to procure &s;ome of them; but their agi|lity,
and the want of addre&s;s in the people,
prevented me from &s;ucceeding. I examined
them in the water; but I could not di&s;tingui&s;h
their genus, on account of the vapour ri&s;ing
from the water. They had brown &s;cales,
and the large&s;t of them were about four inch|es
long. I could not learn how the&s;e fi&s;hes
had got into the baths.' The te&s;timony of
M. Sonnerat is &s;trengthened by that of M. Pre|vo&s;t,
who travelled with him into the interior

&s;orry I have not a copy of our ob&s;ervations

clearly recollect, that the water of the &s;mall

<HEAD>Of Giants.</HEAD>
<P>From monuments which &s;till remain, it ap|pears,
that gigantic animals of different kinds
have formerly exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The large teeth with blunt knobs which I
formerly de&s;cribed, indicate the exi&s;tence of an
animal, who&s;e magnitude greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed that
of the elephant. But this gigantic &s;pecies is

cards, like tho&s;e of the hippopotamus, and
which are four times larger than the teeth of
the pre&s;ent hippopotamus, &s;how that there has
been a very gigantic &s;pecies of this animal. The
enormous thigh-bones, which far exceed the
dimen&s;ions of tho&s;e of our elephants, demon|&s;trate
the &s;ame thing with regard to the elephant
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>In the year 1772, there was found, near
Rome, a petrified head of an ox, which P. Jac|quier
de&s;cribes in the following manner. 'The
length of the front between the two horns, is
2 feet 3 inches; the di&s;tance between the or|bits
of the eyes, 14 inches, and that from the
&s;uperior part of the front to the orbit of the
eye one foot &s;ix inches; the circumference of
the horn at the ba&s;e, is one foot &s;ix inches; the
length of the horn four feet; and the di|&s;tance
between the ends of the horns three
feet. The internal part of this petrefaction
is extremely hard. This head was found at
Puzzolani more than 20 feet below the &s;urface

<P>'In the year 1768, I &s;aw, in the cathedral of
Stra&s;burg, a large horn of an ox &s;u&s;pended by
a chain to a pillar near the choir. It appear|ed
to be three times bigger than tho&s;e of our

could not take the exact dimen&s;ions, but I

judged it to be about 4&frac12; feet long, and from
7 to 8 inches in diameter at the ba&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated to M. de Buffon by M. Grignon, Sept. 24. 1777.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Lionel Waffer relates, that he &s;aw, in Mexi|co,
bones and teeth of a prodigious &s;ize: A|mong
others, he &s;aw a tooth 3 inches broad and
4 in length. Having con&s;ulted the mo&s;t intel|ligent
people of the country, they concluded
that the head could not be le&s;s than a yard
broad<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Waffer's travels in America, p. 367.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, the &s;ame head which Aco&s;ta
mentions: 'I &s;aw,' &s;ays he, 'a grinder which
a&s;toni&s;hed me by its enormous &s;ize; for it was
as large as a man's fi&s;t.' P. Torquemado, a
Franci&s;can, relates, that he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
a grinder, twice as large as a man's fi&s;t, and
which weighed two pounds. He adds, that, in
the city of Mexico, and in the Convent of St
Augu&s;tine, he &s;aw a thigh bone &s;o large, that the
individual to which it belonged mu&s;t have been
from 11 to 12 cubits high, <HI>i. e.</HI> 17 or 18 feet;
and that the head mu&s;t have been as big
as one of the large pitchers u&s;ed in Ca&s;tille
for holding wine.</P>
<P>Phillippe Hernand&eacute;s informs us, that there
were found, at Tezcaco and To&s;uca, &s;everal
bones of an extraordinary magnitude; and that
among the&s;e there are grinding teeth five inches
broad and ten high; from which he concludes,
<PB N="327" REF="334">
that the &s;ize of the head mu&s;t have been &s;o e|normous
that two men could not have embraced
it with their arms. Don Lorenzo Boturini Be|naduci
likewi&s;e tells us, that, in New Spain, and
particularly in the heights of Santa f&eacute;, and in
the territories of Puebla and Ttla&s;cala, they find
enormous bones, and grinders, one of which,
pre&s;erved in the Royal Cabinet, is a hundred
times larger than the large&s;t human teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gigantologie E&s;pagnole, par le P. Torrubia, Journal &eacute;|tranger, Nov. 1760.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The author of this Gigantologie E&s;pagnole
attributes the&s;e enormous teeth and bones to
giants of the human &s;pecies. But, is it credible
that men ever exi&s;ted who&s;e heads were eight
or ten feet in circumference? Is it not equally
a&s;toni&s;hing that, in the &s;pecies of the hippopo|tamus
or elephant, there have been individuals
of this magnitude? We are, therefore, led to
think, that the&s;e enormous teeth are of the &s;ame
kind with tho&s;e lately found in Canada near the
river Ohio, which we a&s;cribed to an unknown
animal, who&s;e &s;pecies formerly exi&s;ted in Tar|tary,
in Siberia, and in Canada, and which exten|ded
from the Illionois as far as Mexico. As
the Spani&s;h authors mention not that elephants
tu&s;ks were found in New Spain along with
the&s;e large grinders, it is probable that a &s;pecies
different from that of the elephant formerly ex|i&s;ted
<PB N="328" REF="335">
there, to which the&s;e large grinders be|longed,
and that this &s;pecies was diffu&s;ed as far
as Mexico. Be&s;ides, the large teeth of the hip|popotamus
&s;eem to have been anciently known;
for St Augu&s;tine tells us, that he &s;aw a grinder
&s;o large, that, if divided, it would have made a
hundred teeth of an ordinary man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Civitate Dei, lib. 15. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Fulgo&s;a

each of which weighed three pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. cap. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Sommer relates, that he found, near Chat|ham
in Canterbury, at the depth of &s;eventeen
feet below the &s;urface of the earth, mon&s;trous
bones, &s;ome of them entire, and others broken.
He likewi&s;e found four entire teeth, each of
them weighing more than half a pound, and
nearly as large as a man's fi&s;t. The whole
four were grinders, and, except in magnitude,
they pretty much re&s;embled human teeth. He
farther remarks, that Louis Vives mentions a
grinder &s;till larger, which was &s;hewn him for a
tooth of St Chri&s;topher. He adds, that Aco&s;ta
&s;aw in India a &s;imilar tooth dug out of the earth,
along with &s;everal other bones, which, when ar|ranged
in proper order, repre&s;ented a man of
a mon&s;trous &s;tature. We might have formed
the &s;ame idea, &s;ays Mr Sommer, concerning the
teeth dug out of the earth near Canterbury, if
<PB N="329" REF="336">
bones had not been found in the &s;ame place,
which could not belong to the human &s;pecies.
Several per&s;ons who examined the&s;e bones, jud|ged
them to be the bones and teeth of the hip|popotamus.
Two of the&s;e teeth are engraved
in the philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, No. 272. fig. 9.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts we may conclude, that mo&s;t
of tho&s;e large bones found under the &s;urface of
the earth belong to the elephant and hippopota|mus:
But it &s;eems to be certain, that, by com|paring
the enormous teeth with blunt knobs,
with tho&s;e of the elephant and hippopotamus,
they have belonged to an animal much larger
than either, and that the &s;pecies of this prodigi|ous
animal no longer exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Among the pre&s;ent elephants it is extremely
rare to find a tu&s;k of &s;ix feet in length. The
longe&s;t are generally from five to &s;ix and a half
feet; and, of cour&s;e, the ancient elephant, which
produced a tu&s;k of ten feet long, who&s;e frag|ments
are in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was a gigantic &s;pe|cies.
The immen&s;e thigh-bone in the Royal
Cabinet confirms the &s;ame conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark is applicable to the &s;pecies
of the hippopotamus. I cau&s;ed two of the lar|ge&s;t
grinders to be extracted from the large&s;t
head of the hippopotamus in the Royal Cabi|net:
One of them weighed ten, and the other
nine and a half ounces. I then weighed two
teeth, the one found in Siberia, and the other in
<PB N="330" REF="337">
Canada. The fir&s;t weighed two pounds twelve
ounces, and the &s;econd two pounds two ounces.
Hence the&s;e ancient hippopotamis were gigan|tic
when compared with tho&s;e now exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>The example already given of the enormous
petrified head of an ox, found in the environs
of Rome, proves, that there have likewi&s;e been
prodigious giants in this &s;pecies of quadruped,
which we are al&s;o enabled to &s;how, by &s;everal
other monuments of antiquity. In the Royal
Cabinet, we have, 1. A fine greeni&s;h horn,
which is very &s;mooth and well turned, and evi|dently
belongs to the ox. The circumference
at the ba&s;e is 25, and its length 42 inches. Its
cavity contains 11&frac14; Paris pints of liquor; 2.
The core, or internal bone of an ox's horn,
which weighs &s;even pounds; whil&s;t the large&s;t
core of the horns of our oxen exceeds not the
weight of one pound: This internal bone was
pre&s;ented to the Royal Cabinet by M. le Comte
de Tre&s;&s;an, a man of ta&s;te, and a good Natural
hi&s;torian; 3. Two internal bones of an ox's
horn attached to a portion of the crani|um,
were found in beds of turf, at the depth
of 25 feet, between Amiens and Abbeville,
and tran&s;mitted to me for the Royal Cabinet.
The whole weighed 17 pounds; and each horn|bone,
when &s;eparated from the cranium, weighed
at lea&s;t 7&frac12; pounds. I compared the dimen&s;ions,
as well as the weight of the&s;e different bones;
<PB N="331" REF="338">
that of the large&s;t ox to be found in Paris was
only 13 inches long, and 7 in circumference at
the ba&s;e. But, of the two dug out of the earth,
the one was 24 inches long, and 12 in circum|ference
at the ba&s;e, and the other 27 inches
in length, and 13 in circumference. The&s;e facts
are more than &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that, in the
&s;pecies of the ox, as well as in tho&s;e of the hip|popotamus
and elephant, prodigious giants have
formerly exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>With regard to the human &s;pecies, individu|al
giants have been produced not only in A&s;ia,
but in every climate; for, even in our own days,
we &s;ee gigantic men in every country. We
lately &s;aw a giant who was born in Finland, on
the very confines of Lapland. But we are not
equally certain, that permanent races, and far
le&s;s entire nations of giants, ever exi&s;ted. How|ever,
the te&s;timony of ancient authors, and e|&s;pecially
tho&s;e of Holy Writ, &s;eem clearly to in|dicate,
that races of giants formerly exi&s;ted in
A&s;ia. In the book of Numbers, chap. 13. ver&s;e
33. it is &s;aid, <HI>And there we &s;aw giants, the
&s;ons of Anak, which came of the giants: and we
were in our own &s;ight as gra&s;hoppers, and &s;o
we were in their &s;ight.</HI> Though this de&s;crip|tion
may have the appearance of exaggeration,
which is common in the oriental &s;tyle, it is
plain that the&s;e giants were very large.</P>
<P>In 2 Samuel, chap. 21. ver&s;e 20. a giant is
<PB N="332" REF="339">
mentioned of the race and family of Goliah,
who had &s;ix fingers and toes on his hands and
feet: In the &s;ame book, there are &s;everal other
pa&s;&s;ages which prove the exi&s;tence and de|&s;truction
of giants.</P>
<P>In Jo&s;hua, chap. 2. ver&s;e 22. it is &s;aid, that
<HI>there was none of</HI> the giants of the race <HI>of the
Anakims left in the land of the children of I&s;rael;
only in Gaza, in Gath, and in A&s;hdod, there re|mained.</HI></P>
<P>Philo, St Cyrillus, and &s;everal other authors,
&s;eem to think, that the word <HI>giants</HI> means only
proud and impious men, and not men of an ex|traordinary
&s;tature. But there is no foundation
for this opinion; &s;ince the amazing height and
&s;trength of the&s;e men are often de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The prophet Amos informs us, that the Lord
<HI>de&s;troyed the Amorite, who&s;e height was like the
height of cedars, and he was &s;trong as the oaks.</HI></P>
<P>Ogg, king of Ba&s;han, was nine cubits high,
and Goliah ten cubits and one palm. Ogg's bed
was nine cubits, or thirteen and a half feet long,
and four cubits, or &s;ix feet, broad. The brea&s;t|plate
of Goliah weighed 208 pounds 4 ounces,
and the blade of his lance 25 pounds.</P>
<P>The&s;e evidences are &s;ufficient to prove, that
there formerly exi&s;ted in the continent of A&s;ia,
not only individuals, but races of giants, who
have been de&s;troyed, and the la&s;t of whom ap|peared
in the days of King David. Nature, who
<PB N="333" REF="340">
never lo&s;es any of her rights, &s;ometimes re|&s;umes
her former powers of production; for, in
almo&s;t every climate, men of an extraordinary
&s;tature, <HI>i. e.</HI> of &s;even and a half, eight, and even
nine feet high, occa&s;ionally appear. Be&s;ide the
examples already given, many others are to be
found, both in ancient and modern authors, of
giants of ten, twelve, fifteen, and eighteen feet
high. But the&s;e la&s;t dimen&s;ions, I am per&s;uaded,
ought to be greatly reduced. The bones of ele|phants
have often been mi&s;taken for human
bones. Be&s;ides, Nature, in her pre&s;ent appear|ance,
pre&s;ents no &s;pecies with &s;uch great di&s;pro|portions,
except, perhaps, that of the hippo|potamus;
for the teeth of tho&s;e found in the
bowels of the earth are at lea&s;t four times larger
than the teeth of the hippopotamus which now
exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The bones of the &s;uppo&s;ed king Teutobochus,
found in Dauphiny, gave ri&s;e to a di&s;pute be|tween
Habicot, a &s;urgeon in Paris, and Riolan,
the favous anatomi&s;t. Habicot, in his <HI>Giganto&s;te|ologie,</HI>
tells us, that the&s;e bones were taken out
of a brick &s;epulchre, 18 feet below ground, and
&s;urrounded with &s;and. He neither gives an ex|act
de&s;cription, nor the number of the&s;e bones.
He a&s;&s;erts that they are human, becau&s;e they
belonged to no other animal. He adds, that
&s;ome ma&s;ons, when working to Seignio Lan|gon,
a gentleman of Dauphiny, on the 11th
<PB N="334" REF="341">
day of January 1613, di&s;covered this tomb near
the ruins of the ca&s;tle of Chaumont; that the
tomb was built with brick; that it was 30 feet
long, 12 broad, and 8 high; that is was covered
with a gray &s;tone, on the middle of which was
engraved, <HI>Theutobochus rex</HI>; that, when the
tomb was opened, a human &s;keleton appeared,
which was 25&frac12; feet long, 10 broad at the &s;houl|ders,
and 5 thick; that, before touching the&s;e
bones, the head was mea&s;ured, and it was 5 feet
in length, and 10 in circumference. Here it is
worthy of remark, that the proportion between
the length of a human head and that of the
body, is not a fifth, but a &s;eventh and one half;
&s;o that this head of 5 &s;eet &s;uppo&s;es the body to
have been 37&frac12; feet in length. La&s;tly, Habicot
tells us, that the under jaw was 6 feet round,
and the orbits of the eyes 7 inches; that each
clavicle was 7 feet long; and that mo&s;t of
the&s;e bones, after being expo&s;ed to the air, crum|bled
into du&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year 1613, Dr Riolan publi&s;hed a
tract under the title of <HI>Gigantomachie,</HI> in which
he maintains, that Habicot, in his Giganto&s;teol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|gle,
had given fal&s;e mea&s;ures of the body and bones
of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e pretended giant Teutobochus; that Riolan
mea&s;ured the thigh-bone and the bone of the
leg together with the a&s;tragalus joined to the
calcaneum; that they exceeded not 6&frac12; feet, e|ven
including the os pubis; and, of cour&s;e, that
<PB N="335" REF="342">
the length of the giant could be only 13 feet,
in&s;tead of 25. He then gives his rea&s;ons for
denying the&s;e bones to be human; and con|cludes,
that the bones exhibited by Habicot be|long
not to man, but to the elephant.</P>
<P>A year after the publication of Habicot's
Giganto&s;teologie and Riolan's Gigantomachie, a
pamphlet appeared under the title of <HI>the Impo&s;|ture,
concerning &s;uppo&s;ed human bones fal&s;ely at|tributed
to King Teutobochus, di&s;covered.</HI> In
this pamphlet, the bones are denied to be human,
and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been engendered by &s;ome
virtue in the earth. Another pamphlet was
publi&s;hed without a name, in which it is &s;aid,
that, among the&s;e bones, &s;ome were human and
others not.</P>
<P>In 1618, Riolan publi&s;hed his <HI>Gigantologie,</HI> in
which he maintains, that the bones in que&s;tion
were not only not human, but that men, in ge|neral,
were never larger than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, Habicot replied to Riolan:
He &s;ays, that he pre&s;ented his Giganto&s;teologie
to Louis XIII.; that, about the end of July in the
year 1613, the bones mentioned in this work were
expo&s;ed to the eye of the public; and that they
are real human bones. He quotes a number of
examples from ancient and modern authors, to
prove that men of immen&s;e &s;tature have exi&s;ted.
He per&s;i&s;ts in maintaining, that the calcaneum,
tibia, and femur of the giant Teutobochus, when
<PB N="336" REF="343">
joined to each other, were more than 11 feet in
length.</P>
<P>He next gives letters written to him at the
time the&s;e bones were di&s;covered, and which
&s;eem to confirm the reality both of the tomb
and of the bones of the giant Teutobochus.
From a letter written by Seignior de Langon,
dated St Marcellin, in Dauphiny, and another by
the Sieur Ma&s;urier, a &s;urgeon at Beaurepaire, it
appears, that &s;ilver coins were found along with
the bones. The fir&s;t letter contains the follow|ing
pa&s;&s;age: 'As his Maje&s;ty,' &s;ays Seignior de
Langon, 'is de&s;irous of having the remaining
bones of King Teutobochus, and the &s;ilver coins
found in the tomb, I declare, that your adver&s;aries
are ill informed, and that, if they knew the mat|ter
more perfectly, they would not entertain
any doubts that the&s;e bones really belong to the
human &s;pecies. The phy&s;icians of Montpellier
came here, and would have given any money
to purcha&s;e the bones. M. le Mar&eacute;chal de
Le&s;diguieres made them be carried to Gre|noble;
and the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons of that
place recogni&s;ed them to be human bones.
This fact, of cour&s;e, can only be denied by
per&s;ons who are ignorant of the real circum|&s;tances.'</P>
<P>In this di&s;pute, neither Riolan nor Habicot,
the one a phy&s;ician and the other a &s;urgeon,
have had &s;en&s;e enough to give an exact de&s;crip|tion
<PB N="337" REF="344">
of the bones in que&s;tion. Both of them,
actuated by pa&s;&s;ion and a party-&s;pirit, have
written in a &s;tyle which de&s;troys all confidence
in their a&s;&s;ertions. Hence it is extremely dif|ficult
to a&s;certain the &s;pecies to which the&s;e
bones really belonged. But, if they were found
in a brick tomb, with a &s;tone cover, upon which
the words <HI>Teutobochus Rex</HI> were in&s;cribed; if
coins were found in this tomb; if it contained
but a &s;ingle &s;keleton of 24 or 25 feet in length;
and, if Seignior Langon's letter relates nothing
but truth, the general fact, <HI>i. e.</HI> the exi&s;tence of
a giant of 24 feet high, unle&s;s we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e
a very extraordinary concour&s;e of fal&s;e|hoods,
could not admit of a doubt. But the
fact is by no means proved, in a manner &s;o ex|plicit
as not to leave room for much he&s;itation.
It is true, that &s;everal authors, otherwi&s;e wor|thy
of credit, have mentioned giants as large,
and even larger. Pliny relates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. cap. 16.</NOTE>, that, by an
earthquake in Crete, a mountain was &s;plit, and
di&s;covered a human body of 16 cubits long,
which &s;ome a&s;cribed to that of Otus, and others
to that of Orion. 16 cubits are equal to 24
feet, which is the &s;ame length with the &s;keleton
of King Teutobochus.</P>
<P>In a Memoir of M. le Cat, an Academician
of Rouen, we have an enumeration of &s;everal
<PB N="338" REF="345">
giants of enormous magnitude, namely, two,
who&s;e &s;keletons were found near Athens, of
which one was 36 and the other 34 feet high;
another of 30 feet was found in Sicily near Pa|lermo,
in the year 1548; another of 33 feet
was likewi&s;e found in Sicily in the year 1550;
and another was al&s;o found in Sicily, near Ma|zarino,
which was thirty feet long.</P>
<P>The&s;e te&s;timonies notwith&s;tanding, it is dif|ficult
to believe that men of 30 or 36 feet high
ever exi&s;ted: It is perhaps too much to believe
in the exi&s;tence of giants of 24 feet high.
However, evidences multiply, become more po|&s;itive,
and gradually increa&s;e, in proportion as
the dimen&s;ions decrea&s;e. M. le Cat relates, that,
in the year 1705, there was found, near the
banks of the river Morderi, at the foot of Mount
Cru&s;&s;ol, the &s;keleton of a giant which mea&s;ured
22&frac12; feet; and that the Dominicans of Valen|cia
have part of the tibia with the joint of the
knee.</P>
<P>Platerus, a celebrated phy&s;ician, a&s;&s;erts, that
he &s;aw at Lucerne the &s;keleton of a man, which
was 19 feet in length.</P>
<P>The giant Ferragus, &s;lain by Rolland, nephew
to Charlemagne, was 18 feet high.</P>
<P>In the &s;epulchral caverns of the i&s;land of Te|neriff,
a &s;keleton was found, which mea&s;ured 15
feet, and in who&s;e jaws were 80 teeth. The&s;e
three facts, as well as the preceding, are rela|ted
<PB N="339" REF="346">
in M. le Cat's e&s;&s;ay concerning giants. He
mentions another &s;keleton found in a ditch near
the convent of the Dominicans at Rouen, the
&s;kull of which held a bu&s;hel of corn, and the
bone of the leg was 4 feet long: The whole bo|dy,
of cour&s;e, mu&s;t have been from 17 to 18
feet in length. Upon the tomb of this giant,
the following in&s;cription was engraved: <HI>Here
lies the noble and pui&s;&s;ant Seigniur le Chevalier
Ricon de Valmont, together with his bones.</HI></P>
<P>In the Journal Litt&eacute;raire of Abb&eacute; Nazari,
we are told, that, in High Calabria, in the
month of July 1665, there was dug out of
the gardens of Signior de Tiviolo, a &s;kele|ton
of 18 Roman feet long; that the head was
2&frac12; feet; that each grinder weighed about an
ounce and a third, and the other teeth three
quarters of an ounce; and that this &s;keleton
was bedded in a ma&s;s of bitumen.</P>
<P>Hector Boethius, in his hi&s;tory of Scotland,
relates, that the bones of a man, ironically call|ed
<HI>Little John,</HI> are &s;till pre&s;erved, who was
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been 14 feet high.</P>
<P>In the Journal des Savans, <HI>anno</HI> 1692, there
is a letter from P. Gentil, profe&s;&s;or of philo&s;o|phy
at Angers, in which he &s;ays, that, having
been informed of a gigantic body di&s;covered
nine leagues from the town of La&s;&s;&eacute;, he went
to the &s;pot to &s;atisfy him&s;elf concerning the truth
of the fact. He learned from the curate of the
<PB N="340" REF="347">
place, that, in digging his garden, a &s;epulchre
was di&s;covered which contained a body of 17
feet 2 inches long. There was no &s;kin on the
body. This body had others between its arms
and legs, which might have been the per&s;on's
children. In the &s;ame place, there were di&s;co|vered
fourteen or fifteen other &s;epulchres, &s;ome
of them 10 feet, others 12, and others 14 feet
long, which contained bodies of the &s;ame di|men&s;ions.
The &s;epulchre of this giant continu|ed
expo&s;ed to the air more than a year; but, as
it attracted too many vi&s;itors to the Curate, he
again covered it with earth, and planted three
trees in the place. The&s;e &s;epulchres were con|&s;tructed
with a &s;tone which re&s;embled chalk.</P>
<P>Thomas Molineux &s;aw, in a cabinet at Ley|den,
a prodigious human frontal bone. From
its junction with the no&s;e to the &s;agittal future, it
was 9 1/12 inches; its length was 12 2/10 inches, and
its thickne&s;s half an inch, <HI>i. e.</HI> in every dimen|&s;ion
it was double that of an ordinary frontal
bone. Hence the per&s;on to whom this gigan|ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
bone belonged mu&s;t have been twice the com|mon
&s;ize of a man, or at lea&s;t 11 feet high.
This bone was unque&s;tionably human; and it
&s;eemed not to have acquired this uncommon
magnitude by the effects of any di&s;ea&s;e; for its
thickne&s;s was exactly proportioned to its other

<P>TO prove that &s;ome of the fi&s;hes and plants

<P>With regard to this &s;ubject, we &s;hall remark,

of &s;tones called <HI>&s;tinking &s;tones.</HI> This &s;tra|tum
is a &s;pecies of gray &s;late, which has deri|ved
its origin from &s;tagnant water, where the

<P>M. Hoffman, when treating of &s;lates, &s;ays,
that the petrified fi&s;hes found in the&s;e &s;tones
have not only been living creatures, but that
the &s;trata of &s;late have originated from muddy
water, which, after fermenting and petrifying,
&s;ub&s;ided in thin laminae or beds.</P>
<P>'In the &s;late of Angers,' &s;ays M. Guettard,
there are &s;ometimes impre&s;&s;ions of plants and
fi&s;hes, which merit the greater attention, be|cau&s;e
the impre&s;&s;ions of the plants repre&s;ent
marine <HI>fuci,</HI> or &s;ea-wreck, and tho&s;e of the

more rare than tho&s;e of &s;caly fi&s;hes, or &s;hells.
He adds, that, after con&s;ulting &s;everal authors

he could not di&s;cover any of them that re|&s;embled

<P>Many proofs might be given that all pit-coal
is compo&s;ed of the &s;poils of vegetables, mixed
with bitumen and &s;ulphur, or rather with the
vitriolic acid, which is perceived when the coal
is burning. We often find a great quantity of
vegetables in the upper &s;trata of coal; and, in
proportion as we de&s;cend, we &s;ee traces of the
decompo&s;ition of the &s;ame vegetables. There
are &s;pecies of coal which are n&oacute;t fo&s;&s;il wood:
That found at Sainte-Agn&eacute;s, near Lons-le-Sau|nier,
has a perfect re&s;emblance to logs or trunks
of fir, in which we di&s;tinctly perceive the marks
of each year's growth, as well as the pith.
The&s;e trunks differ only from common fir by
being &s;omewhat oval, and by their rings being
concentric ellip&s;es. They exceed not a foot in
circumference, and their bark is very thick and
full of furrows, like that of old firs. But the
<PB N="344" REF="351">
bark of common firs, of the &s;ame &s;ize, is always
&s;mooth.</P>
<P>'I found,' M. de Gen&s;anne remarks, '&s;e|veral
veins of this kind of coal in the dioce&s;e
of Montpellier: Here the trunks are very
large; their texture re&s;embles that of che&s;nut|trees
from three to four feet in circumference.
The&s;e fo&s;&s;ils, when burning, have only a &s;light
odour of a&s;phaltis. Their flame and embers
re&s;emble tho&s;e of wood. They are found
near the &s;urface of the earth, and commonly
indicate the exi&s;tence of real pit-coal at great|er
depths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. du Languedoc, par M. de Gen&s;anne, tom. 1. p. 20.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>The&s;e ligneous coals ought to be regarded as
wood depo&s;ited in a bituminous earth, from
which they derive their fo&s;&s;il quality. They
are found only in earths of this kind, and al|ways
near the &s;urface. They &s;ometimes form
the &s;tratum immediately above the &s;eams of real
coal. Some of them, which have been impreg|nated
with a &s;mall quantity only of bitumen, pre|&s;erve
the &s;hades and colour of wood. 'I found
this &s;pecies,' &s;ays M. de Gen&s;anne, 'at Cazarets,
near Saint-Jean-de-Culcul, four leagues from
Montpellier. But, when broken, this fo&s;&s;il
commonly pre&s;ents a &s;mooth &s;urface, perfectly

furrowed and partly di&s;&s;olved by the mineral
acid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. du Languedoc, tom. 1. p. 54.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>After &s;uch proofs, related by M. de Gen&s;anne
him&s;elf, who is otherwi&s;e a good mineralogi&s;t,
I acknowledge, that I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him
a&s;cribe the origin of coal to clay more or le&s;s
impregnated with bitumen. This notion is not
only refuted by his own facts, but we &s;hall be
convinced by tho&s;e I am about to relate, that we
ought to attribute the origin of every &s;pecies of
coal to the &s;poils of vegetables mixed with bitu|men.</P>
<P>I agree with M. de Gen&s;anne, that neither
this fo&s;&s;il wood, nor turf, can be con&s;idered as
coal completely formed. That found near Lons
le-Saunier has been recently examined by the
Pre&s;ident de Ruffey, a learned Academician of
Dijon: He remarks, that this fo&s;&s;il wood
makes a near approach to the nature of pit|coal;
and that it is found within two or three
feet of the &s;urface through an extent of two
leagues; that it is from three to four feet thick;
that we ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;pecies of wood
to be oaks, horn-beams, and trembling poplars;
that this wood is &s;ometimes in the form of bun|dles
or faggots; that the bark of the logs is well

pre&s;erved; that the annual circles, the cuts

<P>'Near the village called <HI>Beichlitz,</HI> about a
league from the town of Halle, two &s;trata,
compo&s;ed of a bituminous earth and fo&s;&s;il
wood, (of which there are &s;everal mines in the
country of He&s;&s;e,) were di&s;covered. It is &s;imi|lar
to that found in the village of Sainte-Ag|n&eacute;s
in Franche-comt&eacute;, two leagues from
Lons-le-Saunier. This mine is in the territo|ry
of Saxe. The fir&s;t &s;tratum lies at the depth
of three fathoms and a half, and is from eight
to nine feet thick. To arrive at it, we cut
through a white &s;and, then a whiti&s;h gray clay,
which is three feet thick: Still deeper, we
meet with a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s both of &s;and
and clay, which cover the &s;econd &s;tratum.
This &s;tratum is only from three and a half to
four feet thick. We &s;ounded deeper, but
found no other &s;trata of that kind.'</P>
<P>'The&s;e &s;trata are horizontal; but they &s;ink

corrupted wood. Pieces of wood of all
&s;izes are found, which, when taken from the
mine, where they are &s;oft, mu&s;t be cut with an
ax. This wood, when dry, breaks ea&s;ily.
When broke, it &s;hines like bitumen; but
we di&s;tinctly perceive in it the whole organi|zation
of wood. It is le&s;s abundant than the
bituminous earth, and the workmen lay it
a&s;ide for their own u&s;e.'</P>
<P>'A bu&s;hel or two quintals of bituminous
earth &s;ells for eighteen or twenty French
&s;ous. In the&s;e &s;trata there are pyrites; they
are of a vitriolic nature; when expo&s;ed to the
air they efflore&s;ce and turn white: But the bi|tuminous
matter is of little value, as it gives
but a feeble heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages Metalurgiques de M. Jars, p. 320.</NOTE>.'</P>
<P>Hence this &s;pecies of fo&s;&s;il wood, found &s;o
near the &s;urface of the earth, mu&s;t be a much
more recent production than common pit-coal,
which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;unk very deep. But
this idea does not preclude the ancient coal from
being formed of the &s;poils of vegetables; &s;ince,
in the deepe&s;t coal-mines, we recogni&s;e woody
&s;ub&s;tances, and &s;everal characters which belong
to vegetables only. Be&s;ides, there are &s;ome ex|amples
of fo&s;&s;il wood found in large ma&s;&s;es, and
in exten&s;ive beds, under &s;trata of free-&s;tone and
calcarious rocks. Hence there is no other dif|ference
<PB N="348" REF="355">
between real pit-coal and the&s;e charred
woods, but what ari&s;es from the degree of de|compo&s;ition,
and from a greater or &s;maller im|pregnation with bitumen. The ba&s;is of their

<P>We are next told, that there are animals, and
even men, &s;o bruti&s;h, that they rather langui&s;h
in the ungrateful &s;oil where they were brought
forth, than take the trouble of removing to a
more comfortable &s;ituation. Of this, &s;ays the
Count de Buffon, I can give a &s;triking exam|ple:
The Maill&eacute;s, a &s;mall &s;avage nation in
Guiana, near the mouth of the river Oua&s;&s;a,
have no other habitation than trees, upon which
they dwell during the whole year, becau&s;e their
country is always more or le&s;s covered with
water. They never de&s;cend from the&s;e trees,
except when they go in canoes in que&s;t of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.
This is a &s;ingular example of a &s;tupid
attachment to a native country; for the&s;e &s;a|vages,
in order to procure habitations on land,
have only to remove a few leagues from tho&s;e
drowned &s;avannahs which gave them birth, and
which they ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to abandon. This

<P>There have been greater and more frequent
revolutions in the Indian ocean than in any o|ther
part of the globe. But, &s;ays the Count de

the &s;ubmer&s;ion of Taprobana.&mdash;The mo&s;t an|cient

<P>It likewi&s;e appears, that the i&s;lands of Mada|ga&s;car
and Ceylon were formerly united to the
adjacent continents. Mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;eparations
and revolutions in the &s;outhern &s;eas have been
produced by the &s;inking of caverns, by earth|quakes,
and by explo&s;ions of &s;ubterraneous fires.
But lands have al&s;o been carried off by the &s;low
and gradual movement of the waters from ea&s;t

<P>In Guiana, our author remarks, the rivers
are &s;o near each other, and at the &s;ame time &s;o
&s;welled and rapid during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, that
they carry down immen&s;e quantities of mud,
and depo&s;it them on all the low grounds and on
the bottom of the &s;ea. The coa&s;ts of French
Guiana are &s;o low, that they may rather be re|garded
as beaches totally covered with mud, and
having an almo&s;t imperceptible declivity. This
mud extends to a great di&s;tance at the bottom
of the &s;ea. Large ve&s;&s;els cannot approach the
river Cayenne without &s;triking; and &s;hips of
war are obliged to remain two or three leagues
from the land. This mud extends along the
whole margin of the &s;ea from Cayenne to the
river of the Amazones. In this great extent of
mud there is no &s;and, and berry-bearing alders
are frequent all along the coa&s;t. But, &s;even or
eight leagues above Cayenne, we&s;tward as far
as the river Marony, we find &s;ome creeks, the
bottoms of which con&s;i&s;t of &s;and and rocks,
which give ri&s;e to breakers. The mud, how|ever,
covers the greater part of the&s;e rocks, as
well as the beds of &s;and; and it is thicker in pro|portion
as it recedes from the margin of the &s;ea.
The&s;e &s;mall rocks prevent not the ground from
<PB N="356" REF="363">
having a very gentle de&s;cent for &s;everal leagues
on land. This part of Guiana, which, to the
north-we&s;t of Cayenne, is more elevated than
the lands to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Of this fact we
have good evidence; for all along the borders
of the &s;ea, we find large drowned &s;avannahs,
mo&s;t of which are dry in the north-we&s;t, whil&s;t
they are totally covered with &s;ea-water in the
&s;outh-ea&s;t parts. Be&s;ide the&s;e lands actually
drowned by the &s;ea, there are others more di&s;|tant,
which have likewi&s;e been formerly drown|ed.
In &s;ome places we al&s;o find &s;avannahs of
fre&s;h water; but they produce no alders, but
many palm-trees. On all the&s;e low coa&s;ts, not
a &s;tone is to be &s;een. The tide ri&s;es &s;even or
eight feet, though it is oppo&s;ed by the currents;
for they are all directed toward the Antilles.
When the waters of the rivers are low, the tide
is very perceptible, as high up the rivers as forty
and even fifty leagues. But, during the rainy
&s;ea&s;on, when the rivers are &s;welled, the tide is
&s;carcely perceptible at the di&s;tance of a league
or two, &s;o great is the rapidity of the waters;
and their impetuo&s;ity is greate&s;t during the re|flux.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;andy bottoms of the&s;e creeks, the
&s;ea-turtles depo&s;it their eggs; and they never
frequent the muddy places; &s;o that, from Cay|enne
to the river of the Amazones, there are no
turtles; and the people go to fi&s;h them from
<PB N="357" REF="364">
the river Courou to the Marony. The mud ap|pears
to gain ground daily on the &s;and; and,
in the progre&s;s of time, the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of
Cayenne will be covered with it as well as
the &s;outh-ea&s;t; for the turtles, who will depo&s;it
their eggs in &s;and only, gradually retire from
the river Courou; and, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, the
fi&s;hers are obliged to &s;earch for them near the
river Marony, the &s;ands of which are not yet
covered.</P>
<P>Beyond the &s;avannahs, &s;ome of which are
dry and others drowned, there is a chain of hills
that are all covered with a great depth of earth,
and every where planted with fore&s;ts. The&s;e
hills are generally from 350 to 400 feet high.
But, about ten or twelve leagues farther up the
country, they are perhaps double this height.
Mo&s;t of the&s;e mountains are evidently extin|gui&s;hed
volcano's. At the top of one of them,
called <HI>la Gabrielle,</HI> there is a &s;mall lake, in which
are a number of alligators, who&s;e &s;pecies &s;eems
to have been pre&s;erved from the time that the
&s;ea covered this hill.</P>
<P>Beyond Mount Gabrielle, we find only &s;mall
valleys, little hills, and volcanic matters, not in
large ma&s;&s;es, but in &s;mall blocks. The mo&s;t
common &s;tone, blocks of which are carried down
by the waters as far as Cayenne, is that called
<HI>beetle-&s;tone.</HI> It is not a &s;tone, but the lava of
a volcano. It has received the name of <HI>beetle-&s;tone,</HI>

<HEAD>Of the Glaciers.</HEAD>
<P>In the highe&s;t regions of the Alps, the wa|ters
which proceed from the annual meltings of
the &s;now, freeze in every direction, and on all the
points of the mountains from their ba&s;es to their
&s;ummits, and e&s;pecially in the valleys, and on
the declivities of tho&s;e that are collected to|gether
in groups: In this manner, the waters
have formed in the&s;e valleys &s;ome mountains
which have rocks for their nucleus, and others
that con&s;i&s;t entirely of ice: The&s;e mountains
are &s;ix, &s;even, and even eight leagues long by
one in breadth, and often from a thou&s;and, to
twelve hundred fathoms high. The&s;e enor|mous
ma&s;&s;es of ice are continually extending
farther along the valleys; for though, in warm
and rainy &s;ea&s;ons, their progre&s;s is not only
&s;topped, but their &s;ize dimini&s;hed, the magni|tude
of the glaciers is perpetually augmenting.</P>
<P>Under the equator, the point of congelation,
in detached mountains, is fixed at the height of
2440 fathoms. But this is no rule for groups
of mountains which are frozen from their &s;um|mits
to their ba&s;e, and never thaw. In the Alps,
<PB N="359" REF="366">
the point of congelation in detached mountains
is a&s;certained to be at the height of 1500 fathoms,
and all below this point thaws completely. But
tho&s;e which are grouped together freeze at a
&s;maller height, and thaw from their top to their
ba&s;e; which &s;hows how much the degree of
cold is augmented by immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of congeal|ed
matter confined within a narrow compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole frozen mountains of Switzerland,
when taken together, occupy an extent of 66
leagues from ea&s;t to we&s;t, mea&s;ured in a &s;traight
line from the we&s;tern borders of the canton of
Vallis towards Savoy, to the ea&s;tern borders of
the canton of Bendner towards Tirol. They
form an interrupted chain, &s;everal arms of which
extend, from north to &s;outh, about 36 leagues.
The great Gothard, the Fourk, and the Grim|&s;el,
are the highe&s;t mountains in this quarter:
They occupy the center of tho&s;e chains which
divide Switzerland into two parts. They are
perpetually covered with &s;now and ice; from
which circum&s;tance they have received the ge|neral
denomination of <HI>Glaciers.</HI></P>
<P>The glaciers are divided into frozen moun|tains,
valleys of ice, fields of ice or frozen &s;eas,
and <HI>gletchers,</HI> or heaps of icy flakes or plates.</P>
<P>The frozen mountains are tho&s;e immen&s;e ma&s;|&s;es
of rocks which reach the clouds, and are
perpetually covered with ice and &s;now.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="367">
The valleys of ice are tho&s;e depre&s;&s;ions be|tween
the mountains which are much more e|levated
than the inhabited valleys. They are
always filled with &s;now, which accumulates,
and forms ma&s;&s;es of ice &s;everal leagues in length.
The&s;e ma&s;&s;es join the high mountains.</P>
<P>The fields of ice, or frozen &s;eas, which lie
along the mountains, have a gentle declivity.
They cannot be called valleys, becau&s;e they are
not &s;ufficiently depre&s;&s;ed. They are covered
with a great thickne&s;s of &s;now. The&s;e fields
receive water from the melting of the &s;now,
which de&s;cends from the mountains, and after|wards
freeze. The &s;urface of the&s;e fields alter|nately
melts and freezes; and the whole are
covered with thick beds of &s;now and ice.</P>
<P>The gletchers are heaps of &s;lakes or plates of
ice formed by the &s;nows, and precipitated from
the mountains. The&s;e &s;nows freeze again, and
are interwoven in various manners: This cir|cum&s;tance
has given ri&s;e to the divi&s;ion of glet|chers
into mounts, mantlings, and walls of ice.</P>
<P>The mounts of ice ri&s;e between the &s;ummits
of the high mountains: They them&s;elves form
mountains; but they contain no rocks. They
are compo&s;ed entirely of ice, and are &s;ometimes
&s;everal leagues in length, one league broad, and
half a league thick.</P>
<P>The mantlings are formed in the &s;uperior
valleys, and upon the &s;ides of the mountains,
<PB N="361" REF="368">
which are covered with ice, having folds re&s;em|bling
drapery: They &s;end their &s;uperfluous wa|ters
into the lower valleys.</P>
<P>The walls of ice are rugged mantlings which
terminate the flat valleys, and appear, at a di|&s;tance,
like troubled &s;eas, who&s;e waves have
been &s;uddenly arre&s;ted and frozen. The&s;e walls
con&s;i&s;t not of irregular points: They often form
columns, pyramids, and enormous towers compo|&s;ed
of &s;everal &s;ides. The&s;e towers are &s;ometimes
hexagonal, and of a blue or greeni&s;h colour.</P>
<P>On the &s;ides, and at the foot of the moun|tains,
ma&s;&s;es of &s;now are formed, which are af|terwards
moi&s;tened with the water from the
melted &s;nows, and then covered with fre&s;h ac|cumulations.
We likewi&s;e &s;ee plates of ice col|lected
in heaps, which belong neither to the fro|zen
valleys nor the mountains of ice. Their
po&s;ition is either horizontal or inclined. The&s;e
detached heaps are called <HI>beds</HI> or <HI>&s;trata</HI> of ice.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e mountains of ice are undermi|ned
by the interior heat of the earth, which
gives ri&s;e to currents of water that melts their
inferior &s;urfaces. They then, by their own
weight, &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly, and their height is re|&s;tored
by the waters, &s;now, and ice, which a|gain
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively cover them. The&s;e &s;inkings
often produce horrible cra&s;hings. The crevices
which open in the ice form precipices which are
both numerous and full of danger. The&s;e a|by&s;&s;es
<PB N="362" REF="369">
are the more treacherous and baneful, be|cau&s;e
they are generally covered with &s;now.
Travellers, and hunters who cha&s;e the fallow|deer,
the chamois goat, &amp;c. or tho&s;e who &s;earch
for cry&s;tals, are often &s;wallowed up by the&s;e
gulfs, and again thrown upon the &s;urface by
the waters which run at their bottoms.</P>
<P>Gentle rain quickly di&s;&s;olves &s;nows: But all
the water which proceeds from them falls not
into the&s;e gulfs. A great part of it freezes on
the &s;urface of the ice and augments its volume.</P>
<P>The warm &s;outh winds, which generally pre|vail
in the month of May, are the mo&s;t power|ful
agents in de&s;troying the &s;nows and ice.
Their melting is announced by the cra&s;hing of the
frozen lakes, and the dreadful noi&s;e produced
by the &s;hock of &s;tones and ice, which in hor|rible
confu&s;ion roll down from the tops of the
mountains, and by torrents of water that fall
from the rocks of more than 1200 feet high.</P>
<P>The heat of the &s;un has little effect upon the
&s;now and ice. Experience has proved, that ice
which has exi&s;ted a long time under an enor|mous
weight, and in accumulated degrees of
cold, is &s;o den&s;e and &s;o completely deprived of
air, that, when &s;mall pieces of it are expo&s;ed to
the greate&s;t heat of the &s;un, during a whole
day, they &s;carcely melt.</P>
<P>Though the glaciers melt partially every &s;um|mer,
though the winds and the heat of certain
<PB N="363" REF="370">
years de&s;troy the accumulation of &s;everal pre|ceding
years; yet it is certain, that the&s;e <HI>gla|ciers
con&s;tantly augment in all their dimen&s;ions.</HI>
This fact is a&s;certained by the annals of the
country, by authentic deeds, and by invariable
tradition. Independent of the&s;e authorities, and
of daily ob&s;ervation, the progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e
of the glaciers is proved by <HI>fore&s;ts of trees
which have been ab&s;orbed by the ice, &s;ome of
who&s;e tops &s;till appear above the &s;urface of the
glaciers</HI>: The&s;e, as well as <HI>the tops of &s;teeples
belonging to a village</HI> that had been buried un|der
the &s;nows, and which are &s;till vi&s;ible after
uncommon meltings, are irrefragable evidences
of the gradual progre&s;s of the glaciers. This
progre&s;&s;ion can proceed from no other cau&s;e
than an augmentation in the degree of cold,
which increa&s;es in proportion to the ma&s;&s;es of
accumulated ice. It is likewi&s;e certain, that, in
the glaciers of Switzerland, the cold is at pre|&s;ent
more inten&s;e, though it continues &s;horter,
than in Iceland, the glaciers of which, as
well as tho&s;e of Norway, have a great relation to
tho&s;e of Switzerland.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the frozen mountains of
Switzerland is &s;imilar to that of all other high
mountains. The nucleus is a vitreous rock
which reaches to their &s;ummit. The parts be|low,
which had been covered with the ocean,
are compo&s;ed of calcarious &s;tone, as well as the
<PB N="364" REF="371">
whole &s;ub&s;tance of the mountains of an inferior
order, which are di&s;po&s;ed in groups at the foot
of the primitive glacier mountains. La&s;tly, the&s;e
calcarious ma&s;&s;es have &s;late, produced by the
&s;ediments of the waters, for their ba&s;is.</P>
<P>The vitreous ma&s;&s;es are pure rock, granite,
and quartz. Their fi&s;&s;ures are filled with me|tals,
&s;emi-metals, mineral &s;ub&s;tances, and cry&s;|tals.</P>
<P>The calcarious ma&s;&s;es are lime-&s;tone, marbles
of every &s;pecies, chalk, gyp&s;um, &s;par, alaba&s;ter,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;laty ma&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;t of &s;lates of various
qualities and colours, which contain plants and
fi&s;hes, and are often &s;ituated at con&s;iderable
heights. Their &s;trata are not always horizon|tal.
They are often inclined, &s;ometimes &s;inua|ted,
and in particular places perpendicular.</P>
<P>We cannot entertain a doubt concerning the
ancient abode of the &s;ea upon the glacier moun|tains.
The immen&s;e quantity of &s;hells, as well as
the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ate and other &s;imilar &s;tones, found in the&s;e
mountains, fully a&s;certain this point. The&s;e
&s;hells are either di&s;tributed in tribes, or different
&s;pecies are blended together, and they are found
at very great heights.</P>
<P>It is probable, that, at a very remote period,
the glaciers had not been formed on the&s;e moun|tains,
not even when the ocean abandoned
them; though it appears by their great di&s;tance
<PB N="365" REF="372">
from the &s;ea, which is near a hundred leagues,
and by their exce&s;&s;ive height, that they were the

<HEAD>Of the North-Ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been advanced by
the Ru&s;&s;ians, it is extremely doubtful that they
ever doubled the northern point of A&s;ia. M.
Engel, who regards the north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age by
Hud&s;on's and Baffin's bay, as impo&s;&s;ible, ap|pears,
on the contrary, to be per&s;uaded, that a
&s;horter and more certain pa&s;&s;age will be found
by the north-ea&s;t. To the feeble rea&s;ons he
gives in &s;upport of this opinion, he adds a re|mark
of M. Gmelin, who, when &s;peaking of
the experiments made by the Ru&s;&s;ians, in order
to di&s;cover this north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays, 'that
the manner in which they proceeded in ma|king
the&s;e di&s;coveries will a&s;toni&s;h the whole

'in this &s;ubject, except it be to learn that
a pa&s;&s;age, which was formerly regarded as im|po&s;&s;ible,
is now found to be extremely practi|cable.
This is the only fact,' he adds, 'which

I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, remark, that we
ought to be well a&s;certained with regard to
facts, before we throw an imputation of this
kind upon the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. In the &s;econd
place, the remark &s;eems to be ill founded; for
the words employed by M. Gmelin may admit
of an oppo&s;ite interpretation from that given of
them by M. Engel, namely, That we will be a|&s;toni&s;hed
when we &s;hall learn that no practi|cable
pa&s;&s;age exi&s;ts by the north-ea&s;t. Indepen|dent
of the general rea&s;ons I have given, I am
confirmed in this opinion by the following cir|cum&s;tance:
The Ru&s;&s;ians them&s;elves, in their
late experiments, uniformly a&s;cend by Kampt|&s;chatka,
and never de&s;cend by the point of A&s;ia.
Captains Bering and T&s;chirikow, in the year
1741, reconnoitered the coa&s;t of America as far
as the 59th degree; but neither of them &s;ailed
northward along the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia. This fact
is a &s;ufficient proof, that the pa&s;&s;age is not &s;o
practicable as M. Engel &s;uppo&s;es; or rather,
that the Ru&s;&s;ians are &s;atisfied that it is not prac|ticable;
for, if otherwi&s;e, their navigators would
have been &s;ent by this route, in&s;tead of making
them take their departure from Kampt&s;chatka,
in order to di&s;cover the we&s;t of America.</P>
<P>M. Muller, who was &s;ent by the Empre&s;s, a|long
with M. Gmelin, to Siberia, is of a very
different opinion from M. Engel. After compa|ring
all the relations on this &s;ubject, M. Muller
<PB N="369" REF="376">
concludes by remarking, that there is only a ve|ry
&s;mall &s;eparation between A&s;ia and America;
and that this &s;trait contains &s;everal i&s;lands,
which &s;erve as common &s;tations to the inhabi|tans
of both continents. This opinion, I believe,
is well founded; and, in &s;upport of it, M.
Muller has collected a great number of facts.
In the &s;ubterraneous abodes of the inhabitants
of the i&s;land of Karaga, we &s;ee beams made of
large pines, which neither this i&s;land, nor the
adjacent countries of Kamt&s;chatka, produce.
The inhabitants &s;ay, that this wood is driven
upon their coa&s;ts by the ea&s;t wind. On the
coa&s;ts of Kamt&s;chatka, boards of ice are dri|ven,
for &s;everal days together, during the win|ter.
At certain &s;ea&s;ons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lights of birds arrive,
and, after &s;taying &s;ome months, return to the
ea&s;t, from whence they came. Hence the con|tinent
oppo&s;ite to that of A&s;ia, toward the
north, de&s;cends as far as Kamt&s;chatka. This
continent mu&s;t be the we&s;t of America. M.
Muller<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 18. p. 484.</NOTE>, after giving an abridgement of five or
&s;ix voyages attempted by the north &s;ea, with a
view to double the north point of A&s;ia, con|cludes,
that every circum&s;tance announces the
impo&s;&s;ibility of this navigation, which he
proves by the following arguments. This na|vigation
mu&s;t be performed in &s;ummer: The
di&s;tance from Archangel to the Oby, and from
<PB N="370" REF="377">
this river to Jeni&s;ey, requires a whole &s;ea&s;on.
The pa&s;&s;age by Waygait has co&s;t infinite labour
to the Briti&s;h and Dutch. In going through
this icy &s;trait, we meet with i&s;lands which block
up the road; and the continent, which forms
a cape between the rivers Pia&s;ida and Chatanga,
and advances beyond the 76th degree of latitude,
is likewi&s;e bordered with a chain of i&s;lands,
which &s;carcely leave a pa&s;&s;age for navigation.
If we want to remove from the coa&s;ts, and
to reach the open &s;ea toward the Pole, the al|mo&s;t
immoveable mountains of ice found at
Greenland and Spitzbergen, &s;eem to indicate a
continuity of ice as far as the Pole. If we want
to go along the coa&s;ts, <HI>this navigation is more
difficult now than it was a hundred years ago.</HI>
There the waters of the ocean are &s;en&s;ibly di|mini&s;hed:
We &s;till &s;ee, at a di&s;tance from the
&s;hoals along the Frozen Sea, wood that had been
thrown upon the lands which formerly bounded
the ocean. The&s;e &s;hoals have &s;o little depth,
that very flat boats can alone be u&s;ed in them:
&s;uch boats are too weak to re&s;i&s;t the ice; neither
can they contain provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for a long
navigation. Though the Ru&s;&s;ians have re&s;our|ces
for &s;ailing the&s;e cold &s;eas &s;uperior to tho&s;e of
mo&s;t other European nations, yet in none of the
voyages attempted upon the Frozen Sea has a
pa&s;&s;age been di&s;covered between Europe or A&s;ia
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o America. It is only by departing from
<PB N="371" REF="378">
Kamt&s;chatka, or &s;ome other more ea&s;terly point
of A&s;ia, that the we&s;terly coa&s;ts of America have
ever been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Captain Bering took his departure from port
Awat&s;cha in Kamt&s;chatka, on the 4th day of
June 1741. After &s;ailing &s;outh-ea&s;t, and then
north-ea&s;t, he di&s;covered, on the 18th of July,
the continent of America in latitude 58&deg; 28&prime;.
Two days after, he anchored near an i&s;land in
the mouth of a bay, from whence he di&s;covered
two capes, the one to the ea&s;t he called Saint-Elie,
and the other to the we&s;t Saint-Hermo|gene.
He then di&s;patched Chitrou, one of his of|ficers,
to reconnoitre the gulf which he had en|tered:
They found that it was inter&s;per&s;ed with
i&s;lands, on one of which they &s;aw de&s;erted cabins
made of planks well joined, and even chamfer|ed.
They conjectured that this i&s;land might
have been inhabited by &s;ome people from the
continent of America. M. Steller, who was
&s;ent to make ob&s;ervations on the&s;e new di&s;cover|ed
lands, found a cave, in which were a quan|tity
of &s;moked &s;almon, ropes, furniture, and o|ther
uten&s;ils. Advancing &s;till farther, he &s;aw
the Americans flying from him. He next per|ceived
a fire on a di&s;tant hill. The &s;avages had
unque&s;tionably retired thither: A rugged and
&s;teep rock covered their retreat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages, tom. 19. p. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="379">
After relating the&s;e facts, it is ea&s;y to perceive,
that it is only by taking their departure from
Kamt&s;chatka that the Ru&s;&s;ians can carry on
commerce with China and Japan, and that it is
equally difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, for the other
nations of Europe to pa&s;s by the north-ea&s;t &s;eas,
the greater part of which are entirely frozen.
Hence I cannot he&s;itate in repeating, that the
only po&s;&s;ible pa&s;&s;age is by the north-we&s;t, at
the bottom of Hud&s;on's bay, and that this is
the place where all future attempts to di&s;cover
this u&s;eful pa&s;&s;age ought to be made.</P>
<P>After the preceding &s;heets had been printed,
I received from M. le Comte Schouvaloff, that
great &s;tate&s;man whom all Europe e&s;teems and
re&s;pects, an excellent memoir compo&s;ed by M.
de Doma&s;cheneff, pre&s;ident of the Imperial So|ciety
of Peter&s;ourg, and to whom the Empre&s;s
has a&s;&s;igned the department of every thing re|lating
to arts and &s;ciences. This illu&s;trious per|&s;on
has likewi&s;e &s;ent me a copy of the chart
drawn by the pilot Otcheredin, in which are
repre&s;ented the tracks and di&s;coveries he made
in the years 1770 and 1773, between Kamt|&s;chatka
and the continent of America. M. de
Doma&s;cheneff, in his memoir, remarks, that
this chart of the pilot Otcheredin is mo&s;t exact,
and that the one publi&s;hed in the year 1773 by
the Academy of Peter&s;burg, requires &s;everal a|mendments,
e&s;pecially with regard to the po&s;i|tion
<PB N="373" REF="380">
of the i&s;lands and the pretended Archipelago,
which are repre&s;ented between the Aleutes or
Aleoutes i&s;lands, and tho&s;e of Anadir, otherwi&s;e
called Andrien. The chart of Otcheredin &s;eems
to &s;how, that the&s;e two groups of i&s;lands, the
Aleutes and the i&s;lands of Andrien, are &s;epara|ted
by an open &s;ea of more than a hundred
leagues broad. M. de Doma&s;cheneff a&s;&s;ures us,
that the great general chart of the Ru&s;&s;ian em|pire,
publi&s;hed in the year 1777, gives an accu|rate
repre&s;entation of all the coa&s;ts on the nor|thern
extremity of A&s;ia inhabited by the T&s;chut|chis:
He &s;ays, that this chart was executed from
the mo&s;t recent di&s;coveries made in the la&s;t ex|pedition
of Major Pawluzki again&s;t that people.
'This coa&s;t,' &s;ays M. de Doma&s;cheneff, 'bounds
the great chain of mountains which &s;eparate
Siberia from the &s;outh of A&s;ia, and terminates
by dividing it&s;elf between the chain that &s;tretch|es
through Kamt&s;chatka, and tho&s;e which
occupy the territories between the rivers that
run to the ea&s;t of the Lena. The known
i&s;lands between the coa&s;ts of Kamt&s;chatka and
tho&s;e of America are mountainous, as well as
the coa&s;ts of Kamt&s;chatka and tho&s;e of the
continent of America. Hence there is a di&s;tinct
continuation between the chains of mountains
belonging to both continents, the intervals of
which, perhaps le&s;s con&s;iderable formerly, may
have been enlarged by the decaying of rocks,
<PB N="374" REF="381">
by the perpetual currents which run from the
Frozen Sea toward the &s;outhern ocean, and by
the revolutions which the earth has undergone.'</P>
<P>But this &s;ub-marine chain which joins the lands
of Kamt&s;chatka to tho&s;e of America is more
&s;outherly, by &s;even or eight degrees, than that
of the i&s;lands of Anadir or Andrien, which,
from time immemorial, have &s;erved the T&s;chut&s;|chis
as a pa&s;&s;age to America.</P>
<P>According to M. de Doma&s;cheneff, it is cer|tain,
that this voyage from the point of A&s;ia to
the continent of America, is performed by oars,
and that the&s;e people go there to di&s;po&s;e of Ru&s;|&s;ian
iron-works to the Americans; that the
i&s;lands in this pa&s;&s;age are &s;o frequent, that the
&s;ailors may &s;leep every night on land; and that
the continent of America, with which the
T&s;chut&s;chis traffick, is mountainous, and covered
with fore&s;ts, which are full of foxes, martins,
and &s;ables, the qualities and colours of who&s;e
furs are totally different from tho&s;e of Siberia.
The&s;e northern i&s;lands, &s;ituated between the
two continents, are known to the T&s;chut&s;chis
only. They form a chain between the mo&s;t ea&s;|tern
point of A&s;ia and the continent of America,
under the 64th degree of latitude; and this chain
is divided by an open &s;ea, from the other more
&s;outhern chain formerly mentioned, which lies
between Kamt&s;chatka and America, and is under
the 56th degree. The i&s;lands of this &s;econd chain
<PB N="375" REF="382">
the Ru&s;&s;ians and inhabitants of Kamt&s;chat|ka
frequent in que&s;t of &s;ea-otters, and black
foxes, who&s;e furs are very precious. Before
the year 1750, even the mo&s;t ea&s;tern of the
i&s;lands which compo&s;e this chain were known.
One of the&s;e i&s;lands bears the name of Captain
Bering, and another, adjacent to the former, is
called the i&s;land of Medenoi. We next meet
with the i&s;lands of Aleutes or Aleoutes. The
two fir&s;t are &s;ituated a little above, and the la&s;t a
little below the 55th degree of latitude. About
the 56th degree, we find the i&s;lands of Atkhou
and Amla&iuml;gh, which are the fir&s;t of the chain
called the I&s;lands of Foxes: They extend as far
to the north-ea&s;t as the 61&s;t degree of latitude.
The&s;e i&s;lands have received their denomination
from the prodigious number of foxes found in
them. The two i&s;lands of Captain Bering and
Medenoi were uninhabited when fir&s;t di&s;covered.
But, in the i&s;lands of Aleutes, though advanced
farther to the ea&s;t, more than &s;ixty families were
found, who&s;e language had no relation either
to that of Kamt&s;chatka or to any of the ori|ental
languages of A&s;ia: It is a dialogue of the
language &s;poken in the other i&s;lands adjacent to
America, which &s;eems to indicate that they have
been peopled by the Americans, and not by the
A&s;iatics.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands called by Captain Bering's crew
Saint-Julian, Saint-Theodor, and Saint-Abra|ham,
<PB N="376" REF="383">
are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which now re|ceive
the name of Aleutes. In the &s;ame man|ner,
the i&s;lands of Chommaghin and Saint-Dol|mat,
di&s;covered by this navigator, form a part
of tho&s;e now called the I&s;lands of Foxes.</P>
<P>'The great di&s;tance,' &s;ays M. de Doma&s;che|neff,
'and the open and deep &s;ea between the
i&s;lands of Aleutes and tho&s;e of Foxes, joined
to the different direction of the latter, render
it probable, that the&s;e i&s;lands never formed one
continued chain, but that the former, with
tho&s;e of Medenoi and Bering, make a chain
which comes from Kamt&s;chatka; that the
I&s;lands of Foxes exhibit another pa&s;&s;age to
America; and that both of the&s;e chains generally
lo&s;s them&s;elves in the depth of the ocean, and
are promontories to the two continents. The
cour&s;e of the I&s;lands of Foxes, &s;ome of which
are of great extent, is intermixed with rocks
and breakers, and continues without interrup|tion
as far as the continent of America. But
the&s;e mo&s;t adjacent to this continent are very
little frequented by the Ru&s;&s;ian hunters; be|cau&s;e
they are very populous, and it would be
dangerous to &s;ojourn in them. There are &s;e|veral
i&s;lands in the neighbourhood of America
which are &s;till little known. Some &s;hips, how|ever,
have penetrated as far as the i&s;land of
Kadjack, which is very near the continent
of America. We are a&s;&s;ured of this fact by the
<PB N="377" REF="384">
relation of the i&s;landers; and other circum|&s;tances
confirm the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion: All
the i&s;lands that lie more to the we&s;t, produce
only dwarfi&s;h and mi&s;-&s;hapen &s;hrubs, which
the winds from the open &s;ea prevent from ri|&s;ing
higher. The i&s;land of Kadjack, on the con|trary,
and the &s;mall adjacent i&s;lands, produce
groves of alder-trees, which &s;eem to indicate
that they are le&s;s expo&s;ed, and that they are
&s;heltered on the north and ea&s;t by a neigh|bouring
continent. Be&s;ides, in Kadjack, we
find fre&s;h water otters, which appear not
in the other i&s;lands; and we likewi&s;e find a
&s;mall &s;pecies of marmot, which &s;eems to be the
marmot of Canada. La&s;tly, we di&s;cover, in
that i&s;land, traces of the bear and wolf; and
the inhabitans clothe them&s;elves with rain|deers
&s;kins brought to them from the conti|nent
of America, to which they lie very con|tiguous.'</P>
<P>'From a voyage to the i&s;land of Kadjack, con|ducted
by one Geottof, we learn, that the con|tinent
of America is called <HI>Atakthan</HI> by the
i&s;landers: They &s;ay, that this great land is
mountainous and covered with fore&s;ts; that
it is &s;ituated to the north of their i&s;land; and
that the mouth of a great river there goes by
the name of <HI>Alagh&s;chak.</HI> Be&s;ides, it is un|que&s;tionable,
that Bering, as well as T&s;chiri|kow,
actually reached this great continent;
<PB N="378" REF="385">
for, at Cape Elie, where Bering moored his
frigate, they &s;aw the coa&s;t ri&s;e into a chain
of mountains which were covered with thick
fore&s;ts. The &s;oil was of a nature totally dif|ferent
from that of Kamt&s;chatka; and Steller
collected a number of American plants.'</P>
<P>M. de Doma&s;cheneff farther ob&s;erves, that all the
I&s;lands of Foxes, as well as tho&s;e of Aleutes
and Bering, are mountainous; that their coa&s;ts
are rocky, often terminate in precipices, and
are &s;urrounded to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance with
rocks; that the country ri&s;es, from the coa&s;ts
to the middle of the&s;e i&s;lands, into rugged
mountains, which form &s;mall chains through
the whole length of each i&s;land. Be&s;ides, there
have been, and &s;till are, volcano's in &s;everal of
the&s;e i&s;lands; and in tho&s;e where the volcano's
are extingui&s;hed, there are fountains of hot
water. In the i&s;lands with the volcano's, no
metals are found, but only calcedons and
&s;ome other coloured &s;tones of no value. In the&s;e
i&s;lands, the inhabitants have no other wood but
what is floated into them by the &s;ea, and the
quantity is not great. More wood arrives in
the i&s;land of Bering and the Aleutes. This
floated wood &s;eems to come from the &s;outh;
for the camphor tree of Japan has been found
on the coa&s;ts of the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are pretty numerous; but, as
they lead a wandering life, and tran&s;port them|&s;elves
<PB N="379" REF="386">
from one i&s;land to another, it is not
po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain their number. It has been
remarked, in general, that the larger the i&s;lands
are, they are the nearer America, and the more
populous. It likewi&s;e appears, that all the in|habitants
of the I&s;lands of Foxes are of the &s;ame
nation, to which tho&s;e of the Aleutes and the
i&s;lands of Andrien may al&s;o be referred, though
they differ in &s;ome cu&s;toms. All the&s;e people,
in their manners, modes of living, and of feed|ing,
have a great re&s;emblance to the E&s;quimaux
and the Greenlanders. <HI>Kanaghi&s;t,</HI> the name of
the&s;e i&s;landers in their own language, and per|haps
corrupted by the mariners, has &s;till a
great affinity to <HI>Karalit,</HI> the denomination of
the E&s;quimaux and their brethren the Green|landers.
Among the inhabitants of all the i&s;lands
between A&s;ia and America, no other uten&s;ils
were found but &s;tone-hatchets, flint-knives, and
the &s;houlder bones of animals &s;harpened to cut
herbage. They have likewi&s;e darts armed
with &s;harp flints, and mo&s;t artfully cut. They
have now a great many implements of iron,
which they have obtained from the Ru&s;&s;ians.
They make canoes like the E&s;quimaux; &s;ome
of them are &s;o large that they contain twenty
per&s;ons. They are made of light wood, and are
entirely covered with the &s;kins of &s;eals and
other &s;ea-animals.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e facts, it appears, that, from
<PB N="380" REF="387">
time immemorial, the T&s;chut&s;chis, who inhabit
the ea&s;tern point of A&s;ia between the 55th and
70th degree of latitude, have had commerce
with the Americans; that this intercour&s;e was
the more ea&s;y to a people accu&s;tomed to all the
rigours of cold; and that the voyage, which
perhaps exceeds not a hundred leagues, might
be performed in &s;imple canoes, conducted by
oars in &s;ummer, and probably on the ice in
winter, by landing daily upon a different i&s;land.
America, therefore, might be peopled by A&s;ia
under this parallel; and every circum&s;tance
&s;eems to indicate, that, though there are now
intervals of &s;ea between the&s;e i&s;lands, they for|merly
con&s;tituted but one continent, by which
America was joined to A&s;ia. It is likewi&s;e
probable, that, beyond the i&s;lands of Anadir or
Andrien, <HI>i. e.</HI> between the 70th and 75th de|gree
of latitude, the two continents are ab&s;olute|ly
united, though that track of land is perhaps
entirely covered with &s;now and ice. To ex|plore
the regions beyond the 70th degree is an
enterpri&s;e worthy of the great Sovereign of the
Ru&s;&s;ias, and it ought to be entru&s;ted to a navi|gator
equally intrepid as Captain Phipps. I am
per&s;uaded, that they would find the two conti|nents
united; but, if otherwi&s;e, and if there
is an open &s;ea beyond the i&s;lands of Andrien,
it appears to be certain, that they would find the
projections of the great Polar glacier at the 81&s;t

<HEAD>Concerning that period when the powers of Man
aided tho&s;e of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t men were witne&s;&s;es of the convul|&s;ive
motions of the earth, which were then fre|quent
and terrible. For a refuge again&s;t inun|dations,
they had nothing but the mountains,
which they were often forced to abandon by the
fire of volcano's. They trembled on ground
which trembled under their feet. Naked in
mind as well as in body, expo&s;ed to the injuries
of every element, victims to the rapacity of fe|rocious
animals, which they were unable to
combat, penetrated with the common &s;entiment
of terror, and pre&s;&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity, they mu&s;t
have quickly a&s;&s;ociated, at fir&s;t to protect them|&s;elves
by their numbers, and then to afford mu|tual
aid to each other in forming habitations
and weapons of defence. They began with &s;harp|ening
into the figure of axes tho&s;e hard flints,
tho&s;e <HI>thunder-&s;tones,</HI> which their de&s;cendants i|magined
to have been produced by thunder, and
to have fallen from the clouds, but which, in
reality, are the fir&s;t monuments of human art.
They would &s;oon extract fire from the&s;e flints
by &s;triking them again&s;t each other.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="389">
To de&s;troy the bru&s;hwood and the fore&s;ts,
they would employ the flames derived from vol|cano's,
or from their burning lavas; for, with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this powerful element, they
cleared and purified the grounds which they
cho&s;e to inhabit. With the axes of &s;tone, they
cut trees, and fabricated tho&s;e weapons and u|ten&s;ils
of which nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the u&s;e;
and, after being provided with clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s and other
heavy armour, would not the&s;e fir&s;t men di&s;co|ver
the means of making lighter weapons to
annoy at a di&s;tance? The tendon of an ani|mal,
the fibres of aloes, or the pliant bark
of &s;ome ligneous plant, would &s;erve them for
a cord to unite the extremities of an ela&s;tic
branch; with which they made their bow:
To arm their arrows, they employed &s;mall
&s;harp flints. In a &s;hort time they would have
thread, rafts, and canoes; and in this &s;tate
they would remain till little nations were form|ed.
The&s;e nations were compo&s;ed of a few fa|milies,
or rather of the de&s;cendants of the &s;ame
family, which is &s;till the condition of tho&s;e &s;ava|ges
who live independent in &s;uch open and &s;pa|cious
territories as afford them game, fi&s;hes,
and fruits. But, in territories which are nar|rowed
by waters, or confined by high moun|tains,
the&s;e &s;mall nations, after a great increa&s;e
of population, were obliged to divide the land
among them&s;elves; and, from this moment,
the earth became the inheritance of man. He

<P>Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e men, deeply affected with
the mi&s;eries of their original &s;tate, and having
&s;till before their eyes the ravages of inundations,
the conflagrations of volcano's, and gulfs open|ed
by the &s;uccu&s;&s;ions of the earth, have pre|&s;erved
a durable, and almo&s;t eternal, remem|brance
of the calamities the world has &s;uffered.
The idea, that it mu&s;t peri&s;h by an univer&s;al de|luge,
or by a general conflagration; the reve|rence
for certain mountains upon which they
had been &s;aved from inundations; their horror
at others which threw out fires more dreadful
than tho&s;e of thunder; the view of tho&s;e com|bats
between the earth and heavens, which gave
ri&s;e to the fable of the Titans, and of their a&s;|&s;aults

exi&s;tence of a malevolent being, with the terror
and &s;uper&s;tition which it unavoidably produced;
all the&s;e &s;entiments, founded upon fear, took
an unconquerable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human mind.
Even at pre&s;ent, men are not entirely emanci|pated

tho&s;e ages of convul&s;ions and &s;torms,
nor by the knowledge of the effects and opera|tions
of Nature, a knowledge which could not
be acquired till after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome
great &s;ociety in a tranquil land.</P>
<P>It is neither in Africa, nor in the mo&s;t &s;outh|ern
regions of A&s;ia, that great &s;ocieties or nations
could be fir&s;t formed. The&s;e countries were
&s;till burning and de&s;ert. Neither could this e|vent
happen in America, which, except its
chain of mountains, is evidently a new country;
nor even in Europe, which very lately derived
its learning from the Ea&s;t, where the fir&s;t civi|lized
men were e&s;tabli&s;hed; for, before the
foundation of Rome, the happie&s;t countries in this
part of the world, &s;uch as Italy, France, and Ger|many,
were then peopled with men more than half
&s;avage. Tacitus, in his Manners of the Ger|mans,
exhibits a picture of tho&s;e of the Hurons,
or rather of men ju&s;t emerging from a &s;tate of
nature. Hence the &s;ource of human knowledge
mu&s;t have ari&s;en in the northern countries of
A&s;ia; and power is a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of know|ledge.
The more man knows, the more he can
perform; and the le&s;s he has done, the le&s;s he
knows. All this implies an active people in a
happy climate, living under a pure &s;ky and in
a fertile country, remote from inundations and
volcano's: It mu&s;t al&s;o have been a high coun|try,
and, of cour&s;e, more anciently temperate
<PB N="385" REF="392">
than the more &s;outhern regions. Now, all the&s;e
conditions, all the&s;e circum&s;tances, are united in
the centre of A&s;ia, from the 40th to the 55th de|gree
of latitude. The rivers which run into the
North Sea, into the Ea&s;tern Ocean, and into the
South and Ca&s;pian Seas, take their ri&s;e from
this elevated region, which at pre&s;ent compo&s;es
the &s;outhern part of Siberia and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">artary. It
is, therefore, in this country, which is more e|levated
than all the others, &s;ince it &s;erves them
as a centre, and is near five hundred leagues
from any ocean; it is in this privileged country
that the fir&s;t people worthy of notice were pro|duced;
and they merit our e&s;teem as the inven|tors
of arts, &s;ciences, and every u&s;eful in&s;titution.
This truth is equally evident from the monu|ments
of natural hi&s;tory, and from the almo&s;t
inconceivable progre&s;s of a&s;tronomy. How
could men &s;o new invent the luni&s;olar period of
&s;ix hundred years? I confine my&s;elf to this
&s;ingle fact, though many others equally wonder|ful
and permanent might be produced. The&s;e
people, therefore, knew as much of a&s;tronomy as
was known in the days of Ca&s;&s;ini, who fir&s;t de|mon&s;trated
the reality and exactne&s;s of this pe|riod
of &s;ix hundered years; a knowledge of
which the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks,
were perfectly ignorant; a knowledge which
pre&s;uppo&s;es that of the exact movements of the
earth and moon, and requires great perfection in

the in&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary to make ob&s;ervations;
a knowledge, which, as it implies the acqui&s;ition
of every thing derived from a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
a&s;tronomical &s;tudy and re&s;earch, mu&s;t have re|quired
at lea&s;t two or three thou&s;and years exer|tion
of the human mind.</P>
<P>The&s;e fir&s;t people, becau&s;e they had become
very learned, mu&s;t have been proportionally hap|py.
They mu&s;t have enjoyed many ages of
peace and lei&s;ure, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the
cultivation of &s;cience. Before they could enter|tain
a &s;u&s;picion concerning the period of &s;ix
hundred years, at lea&s;t twelve hundred years of
a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations were requi&s;ite; and,
to a&s;certain the fact, more than double that
number of years were nece&s;&s;ary. Thus we
have already about three thou&s;and years employ|ed
in a&s;tronomical &s;tudies: Neither &s;hould this
circum&s;tance &s;urpri&s;e us; for, in reckoning from
the Chaldean a&s;tronomers to the pre&s;ent day, an
equal time has been employed in di&s;covering
this period of &s;ix hundred years. Be&s;ides, the&s;e
three thou&s;and years of a&s;tronomical ob&s;erva|tions
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been preceded by
many ages in which &s;cience was unknown. Nay,
are &s;ix thou&s;and years from the pre&s;ent time
&s;ufficient to di&s;cover the mo&s;t noble epoch in
the hi&s;tory of man, or even to trace his gradual
progre&s;s in the arts and &s;ciences?</P>
<P>But, unhappily the&s;e &s;ublime and beautiful
<PB N="387" REF="394">
&s;ciences are lo&s;t: We can only recogni&s;e their
pa&s;t exi&s;tence by deformed and imperfect frag|ments.
The invention of the <HI>formula</HI> by which
the Brahmins calculate eclip&s;es, pre&s;uppo&s;es as
much &s;cience as the con&s;truction of our Epheme|rides;
and yet the&s;e Brahmins have not the
&s;malle&s;t idea of the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e.
They po&s;&s;e&s;s only &s;ome fal&s;e notions concerning
the motion, magnitude, and po&s;ition of the pla|nets.
They calculate eclip&s;es without knowing
the theory of them. This operation they are
enabled to perform by machines or tables found|ed
upon learned formulae, which they do not
comprehend, and which, probably, were not in|vented
by their ance&s;tors; becau&s;e they have
never brought any thing to perfection, and
have not tran&s;mitted the &s;malle&s;t ray of &s;cience
to their de&s;cendants. In their hands, the&s;e for|mulae
are only practical methods; but they im|ply

have not pre&s;erved the &s;lighte&s;t ve&s;tige, and
which, of cour&s;e, they have never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
Hence the&s;e methods could only proceed from
that ancient people, who had reduced into for|mulae
the motion of the &s;tars, and who, by a
long cour&s;e of ob&s;ervations, could not only
predict eclip&s;es, but, what is much more diffi|cult,
they recogni&s;ed the period of &s;ix hundred
years, and, of cour&s;e, were acquainted with all
<PB N="388" REF="395">
tho&s;e a&s;tronomical facts which this di&s;covery ne|ce&s;&s;arily
required.</P>
<P>I may affirm, that the Brahmins never in|vented
the&s;e formulae; becau&s;e all their phy|&s;ical
ideas are contrary to the theory on which
the&s;e formulae depend. If they had compre|hended
this theory, even at the time they re|ceived
its re&s;ults, the &s;cience would have been
pre&s;erved, and they would not, as they do at
pre&s;ent, have entertained the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and
ignorant notions concerning the &s;y&s;tem of the
univer&s;e; for they believe that the earth is im|moveable,
and is &s;upported by a mountain of
gold; that the moon is eclip&s;ed by aerial dra|gons;
that the planets are &s;maller than the
moon, &amp;c. It is therefore evident, that they
never had the fir&s;t elements of a&s;tronomical the|ory,

<P>The Chine&s;e, who are a little more enlight|ened
than the Brahmins, calculate eclip&s;es in a
very rude manner, and they have continued to cal|culate
them in the &s;ame manner for two or three
thou&s;and years. As they bring nothing to perfec|tion,
they can never invent. Hence &s;cience neither
originated in China nor in India. Though equal|ly
near as the Indians to the fir&s;t learned people,
<PB N="389" REF="396">
the Chine&s;e appear not to have derived any ad|vantage
from this favourable &s;ituation. They
are not even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e a&s;tronomical for|mulae
of which the Brahmins have pre&s;erved
the u&s;e, and which con&s;titute the fir&s;t great mo|numents
of the knowledge and happine&s;s of
man. Neither does it appear that the Chaldeans,
Per&s;ians, Egyptians, or Greeks, received any ad|vantage
from this fir&s;t enlightened race of
men; for, in the&s;e Levant countries, the new
a&s;tronomy mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the indefatigable
a&s;&s;iduity of the Chaldean ob&s;ervers, and after|wards
to the labour of the Greeks, which can
only be dated from the foundation of the Alex|andrian
&s;chool. This &s;cience, however, after the
culture of two thou&s;and years, and even till the&s;e
two or three la&s;t centuries, was very imper|fect.
It &s;eems, therefore, to be certain, that the&s;e
people, who fir&s;t invented, and for a long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of ages &s;o happily cultivated a&s;tronomy,
have left nothing but &s;ome fragments, &s;ome
re&s;ults of the &s;cience, which might be retained
in the memory, &s;uch as that of the period of &s;ix
hundred years, which has been tran&s;mitted to us
by Jo&s;ephus the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian, who did not
under&s;tand its value or import.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the &s;ciences, that fir&s;t wound to
humanity inflicted by the &s;word of barbarity,
mu&s;t have been the effect of &s;ome direful revo|lution,
which, in a few years perhaps, de&s;troyed
<PB N="390" REF="397">
the labours and the ingenuity of many ages; for
tho&s;e fir&s;t powerful and learned people mu&s;t
have continued long in a &s;tate of &s;plendour and

the &s;ciences, and, of cour&s;e, in all the arts
which the &s;tudy of them nece&s;&s;arily require.
But it is extremely probable, that, when the
regions to the north of this happy country, had
become too cold, their inhabitants, &s;till igno|rant,
ferocious, and barbarous, would pour in
upon this rich and cultivated country. It is e|ven
a&s;toni&s;hing, that the&s;e barbarians &s;hould have
been able to annihilate not only the principles,
but the remembrance of all &s;cience. Three
thou&s;and years of ignorance, perhaps, followed
the three thou&s;and years of light and knowledge
which had preceded them. Of all the&s;e fir&s;t and
beautiful fruits of the human genius, there now
remains nothing but a meta phy&s;ical religion,
which, being incomprehen&s;ible, required no
&s;tudy, and could neither be altered nor lo&s;t but
by a defect of memory, which never fails when
it is &s;truck with the marvellous. From this fir&s;t
centre of the Sciences, the &s;ame metaphy&s;ical re|ligion

the love of &s;ociety, though engraven on the hu|man

However, after the lo&s;s of the &s;ciences, the
u&s;eful arts to which they had given birth were
pre&s;erved. The cultivation of the earth, which
became more nece&s;&s;ary in proportion to the in|crea&s;e

which this culture requires, as well as all tho&s;e

the fabrication of idols and arms, in the weaving

&s;till more profoundly interred, could not elude
his re&s;earches, but have become the reward of
his labours. When he conducted him&s;elf with
wi&s;dom, he followed the le&s;&s;ons of Nature;
he derived advantage from her examples; he
employed her means, and, from the immen&s;ity
of her productions, &s;elected all tho&s;e objects from
which he could derive either utility or plea&s;ure.

&s;hall have better notions of their real intere&s;t;
that they will learn the value of peace and tran|quil
happine&s;s; that the acqui&s;ition of this object
will be the chief aim of their ambition; and
that Princes will di&s;dain the fal&s;e glory of con|querors,
and de&s;pi&s;e the little re&s;tle&s;s vanity of
tho&s;e who excite them to &s;uch dreadful com|motions.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e the world in peace, and take
a nearer pro&s;pect of the influence of man's pow|er
over that of Nature. Nothing appears to be
more difficult, not to &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible, than to op|po&s;e
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive cooling of the earth, and to
warm the temperature of a climate; yet this
feat man can and has performed. Paris and
Quebeck are nearly under the &s;ame degeee of la|titude;
Paris, therefore, would be as cold as
Quebeck, if France and the adjacent countries
were as thinly inhabited, and as much covered
with wood and water as the territories in the
neighbourhood of Canada. The draining, clear|ing,
and peopling a country, will give it a
warmth which will continue for &s;ome thou&s;and
years; and this fact will prevent the only rea|&s;onable
<PB N="397" REF="404">
objection which can be made again&s;t my
opinion, that the earth is gradually cooling.</P>
<P>According to your &s;y&s;tem, it may be &s;aid, the
whole earth mu&s;t be cooler now than it was two
thou&s;and year ago: But tradition proves the
contrary. France and Germany formerly pro|duced
rain-deer, lynxes, bears, and other ani|mals
which have &s;ince retired to more northerly
regions. This progre&s;s is very different from
what you maintain, namely, from north to
&s;outh. Be&s;ides, hi&s;tory informs us, that the
river Seine was annually frozen during a part
of the winter. Are not the&s;e facts a direct con|tradiction
to the gradual cooling of the earth?
They would, I acknowledge, if France and Ger|many
were now in the &s;ame &s;tate; if we had
not cut down the fore&s;ts, drained the mar&s;hes,
confined the torrents, directed the rivers, and
cleared all the lands which were overgrown
with unprofitable plants. But we ought to con|&s;ider,
that the heat of the globe dimini&s;hes in
an imperceptible manner; that &s;eventy-two
thou&s;and years were nece&s;&s;ary to cool it to a
proper temperature, and that an equal portion
of time mu&s;t elap&s;e before it is &s;o cold as to be
un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it for the nouri&s;hment of animals and vege|tables.
We mu&s;t con&s;ider the difference be|tween
this &s;low cooling of the earth and the
&s;udden colds produced in the atmo&s;phere; and
we mu&s;t neverthele&s;s recollect, that the differ|ence
<PB N="398" REF="405">
between the greate&s;t heat of our &s;ummers,
and the greate&s;t cold of our winters, exceeds not
a thirty-&s;econd part. From the&s;e con&s;iderations
it is apparent, that external cau&s;es have a much
greater influence upon the temperature of every
climate than the internal cau&s;e, and that, in all
tho&s;e climates where the cold of the &s;uperior re|gions
of the air is attracted by moi&s;ture, or pu&s;h|ed
by the winds towards the &s;urface, the effects
of the&s;e particular cau&s;es are much more power|ful
than that produced by the general cau&s;e.
Of this we &s;hall give an example, which will
remove every doubt, and at the &s;ame time ob|viate
every &s;imilar objection.</P>
<P>In the immen&s;e territories of Guiana, which
are covered with thick fore&s;ts, where the &s;un
can hardly penetrate, where great tracts of
country are overflowed with water, where the
rivers are very near each other, and are neither
re&s;trained nor directed, where it rains continual|ly
during eight months of the year, the inhabi|tants,
about a century ago, began to clear the
country arround Cayenne, which is a very &s;mall
canton of the&s;e va&s;t fore&s;ts. The difference of
temperature in this little di&s;trict is already &s;o
perceptible, that the people are too warm during
the night; but, in all the lands which are cover|ed
with wood, the nights are &s;o cold that &s;ires
are nece&s;&s;ary in the hou&s;es. The &s;ame effect is
produced with regard to the quantity and dura|tion
<PB N="399" REF="406">
of the rains: They cea&s;e &s;ooner and com|mence
later at Cayenne than in the interior parts
of the country; neither are they &s;o heavy, nor
&s;o frequent. At Cayenne, there are four months
of ab&s;olute drine&s;s: But, in the interior parts of
the country, the dry &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts only three
months; be&s;ides, a daily rain is brought down
by the &s;outh winds, which is pretty violent. An|other
circum&s;tance merits attention: It &s;eldom
thunders at Cayenne; but, in the interior parts,
where the clouds are black, thick, and very low,
the thunder is violent and very frequent. The&s;e
facts &s;how, in the cleare&s;t manner, that, in this
country, the eight months of perpetual rain
might be dimini&s;hed, and the heat greatly aug|mented,
if the fore&s;ts were cut down, if the wa|ters
were re&s;trained, and the rivers properly di|rected,
and if the cultivation of the earth,
which &s;uppo&s;es the movements of a great num|ber
of men and animals, bani&s;hed that cold and
&s;uperfluous moi&s;ture which is attracted and dif|fu&s;ed
by the immen&s;e quantity of vegetables.</P>
<P>As every action, every movement, produces
heat, and as all beings endowed with the faculty
of progre&s;&s;ive motion, may be con&s;idered as &s;o
many little fires, it is in proportion to the num|ber
of men and animals, that (every thing el&s;e
being equal) the local temperature of each par|ticular
country depends. The former diffu&s;e heat,
the latter nothing but cold and moi&s;ture. The
perpetual u&s;e men make of fire adds greatly to
<PB N="400" REF="407">
the artificial temperature of all populous terri|tories.
In Paris, during great colds, the ther|mometers
at the Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute; &s;tand
two or three degrees lower than tho&s;e at the Fau|bourg
Saint-Merceau; becau&s;e the north wind is
heated in pa&s;&s;ing over the numerous chimneys
of that great city. A &s;ingle fore&s;t in any country
is &s;ufficient to produce &s;ome change in its tem|perature.
Trees attract the cold; by their &s;hade
they dimini&s;h the heat of the &s;un; they produce
moi&s;t vapours that form clouds and fall down in
rain, which is always colder from the greater
height it de&s;cends. When the&s;e fore&s;ts are a|bandoned
to Nature alone, the old trees fall and
coldly corrupt; but, when under the dominion
of man, they are u&s;ed as fewel to the element
of fire, and become the &s;econdary cau&s;es of e|very
particular heat. In meadows, before the
herbage is cut down, there are always copious
dews, and often &s;mall &s;howers of rain, which
cea&s;e as &s;oon as the gra&s;s is carried off. The&s;e
&s;mall rains would become more abundant and
more durable, if our meadows, like the &s;avan|nahs
of America, were always covered with the
&s;ame quantity of herbs, which, in&s;tead of dimi|ni&s;hing,
mu&s;t increa&s;e by the accumulating ma|nure
of all tho&s;e that die and corrupt on the
&s;urface.</P>
<P>Many other examples might be given, all
concurring to &s;how that man can have an in|fluence
<PB N="401" REF="408">
on the climate he inhabits; and; in a
manner, fix its temperature at any point that
may be agreeable to him; and; what is &s;ingular,
it is more difficult for him to cool than to heat
the earth. He is ma&s;ter of the element of fire;
which he can augment and propagate at plea|&s;ure,
but not of the element of cold, which he
can neither lay hold of nor communicate. The
principle of cold is not a real &s;ub&s;tance, but a
&s;imple privation, or rather diminution of heat;
a diminution which ought to be very great in
the high regions of the air, and which, at the
di&s;tance of a league from the earth, converts the
aqueous vapours into hail and &s;now. For the
emanations of the heat proper to the globe ob|&s;erve
the &s;ame law as all other phy&s;ical quanti|ties
or qualities which proceed from a common
centre; and, as their inten&s;ity decrea&s;es in the
inver&s;e ratio of the &s;quare of the di&s;tance, it ap|pears
to be certain, that the atmo&s;phere is four
times colder at the height of two leagues than
at that of one; each point of the earth's &s;urface
being con&s;idered as a centre. On the other
hand, the interior heat of the globe, in every
&s;ea&s;on, is con&s;tantly ten degrees above the free|zing
point. Hence the earth can never be cold|er
than ten degrees above this point, except by
the fall of cold matters upon its &s;urface from the
&s;uperior regions of the air, where the effects of
the internal heat of the globe dimini&s;h in pro|portion
<PB N="402" REF="409">
to the height. Now, the power of man
extends not &s;o far. He cannot make cold de|&s;cend,
as he makes heat a&s;cend. He has no o|ther
mode of defending him&s;elf from the ar|dour
of the &s;un's rays, but by forming a &s;hade.
But it is more ea&s;y to cut down the fore&s;ts of
Guiana, in order to heat the humid earth, than
to plant trees in Arabia to refre&s;h the burning
&s;ands. A &s;ingle fore&s;t, however, in the mid&s;t
of the&s;e parched de&s;erts, would be &s;ufficient
to render them more temperate, to attract
the waters from the atmo&s;phere, to re&s;tore all
the principles of fertility to the earth, and, of
cour&s;e, to make man, in the&s;e barren regions,
enjoy all the &s;weets of a temperate climate.</P>
<P>It is upon the difference of temperature that
the &s;tronger or weaker energies of Nature de|pend.
The growth, and even the production,
of all organized beings, are only particular effects
of this general cau&s;e: Hence man, by modi|fying
this cau&s;e, may in time de&s;troy what in|jures
him, and give birth to every thing that is
agreeable to his feelings. Happy are tho&s;e
countries where all the elements of temperature
are balanced, and &s;o fortunately combined as to
produce only good effects! But, has any
country, from its origin, ever enjoyed this pri|vilege?
Is there any country where the power
of man has not aided that of Nature, either by
attracting or di&s;&s;ipating the waters, by de&s;troy|ing
<PB N="403" REF="410">
noxious or &s;uperfluous vegetables, and by
taming and multiplying u&s;eful animals? Of
three hundred &s;pecies of quadrupeds, and fifteen
hundred &s;pecies of birds, man has &s;elected nine|teen
or twenty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The elephant, the camel, the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the ox, the &s;heep, the goat, the hog, the dog, the cat, the lama, the vigogne, the buffalo; the hen, the &s;wan, the guiney hen, the duck, the peacock, the phea&s;ant, and pigeon.</NOTE>; and the&s;e twenty &s;pecies
make a greater figure in Nature, and are more
u&s;eful to the earth than all the others: They
make a greater figure, becau&s;e they are directed
and prodigiou&s;ly multiplied by man. By co-o|perating
with him, they produce all the benefits
which could be expected from a wi&s;e di&s;tribu|tion
of powers in cultivating the earth, in tran&s;|porting
the articles of commerce, in augmenting
provi&s;ions, in &s;upplying all the wants, and in
mini&s;tering to the plea&s;ures of their only ma&s;ter
who can reward their &s;ervices by his indu&s;try
and attention.</P>
<P>Of the &s;mall number of animals &s;elected by
man, the hen and the hog &s;pecies, which are the
mo&s;t prolific, are likewi&s;e the mo&s;t generally
diffu&s;ed, as if the aptitude for great multiplica|tion
were accompanied with that vigour of con|&s;titution
which braves every danger or inconve|niency
ari&s;ing from difference of climate. The
hen and the hog have been found in the mo&s;t
unfrequented regions of the earth, in Otaheite
and other &s;outhern i&s;lands, which are the mo&s;t
<PB N="404" REF="411">
remote from any continent, and have, till very
lately, remained for ever unknown. It appears
that the&s;e &s;pecies have followed man in all his
emigrations. In &s;outh America, where none of
our animals could po&s;&s;ibly arrive, we find the
pecari and wild hen, which, though &s;maller and
a little different from the hog and hen of our
continent, mu&s;t be regarded as a &s;pecies &s;o much
allied that they might ea&s;ily be reduced to a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate. But &s;avage man, having no idea
of &s;ociety, is not &s;ollicitous about that of ani|mals.
In the regions of &s;outh America, the
&s;avages have no dome&s;tic animals. They de|&s;troy
indifferently the good with the bad &s;pecies.
They &s;elect none for the purpo&s;es of rearing and
multiplying them; while a &s;ingle fertile &s;pecies,
like that of the <HI>hocco</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A large and very prolific bird, who&s;e fle&s;h is as good as that of the phea&s;ant.</NOTE>, which is at their com|mand,
would furni&s;h them, with very little at|tention,
more &s;ub&s;i&s;tance than they can procure
by their laborious and painful huntings.</P>
<P>Thus the fir&s;t mark of man's civilization is
the empire he a&s;&s;umes over the animals; and
this fir&s;t mark of his intelligence becomes after|wards
the greate&s;t evidence of his power over
Nature: For it is only after he &s;ubjugates and
tames animals, that he is enabled, by their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
to change the face of the earth, to convert
de&s;erts into fertile ground, and heath into corn.
By multiplying u&s;eful animals, he augments
<PB N="405" REF="412">
the quantity of life and motion on the &s;urface
of the earth; he, at the &s;ame time, improves
the whole race of beings, and ennobles him&s;elf,
by tran&s;forming the vegetable into the animal,
and both into his own &s;ub&s;tance, which after|wards
diffu&s;es it&s;elf by a numerous multiplica|tion.
He every where produces plenty of pro|vi&s;ions,
which is always &s;ucceeded by great po|pulation.
Millions of men exi&s;t in the &s;ame
&s;pace which was formerly occupied by two or
three hundred &s;avages, and millions of animals
where only a few individuals exi&s;ted. By him,
and for his u&s;e, all the precious germs are un|folded;
the productions of the noble&s;t kinds
are alone cultivated; upon the immen&s;e tree of
fecundity the fruitful branches are alone brought
to perfection.</P>
<P>Grain, of which man makes bread, is not the
gift of Nature, but the fruit of his re&s;earches
and of his knowledge in the fir&s;t of all arts. In
no quarter of the earth has wild corn been ever
found: It is evidently an herb brought to per|fection
by his care and indu&s;try. This precious
plant he mu&s;t have &s;elected out of many thou|&s;ands.
He mu&s;t have &s;own and reaped a num|ber
of times, in order to di&s;cover its fertility,
which is always proportioned to the manure
and culture be&s;towed upon the &s;oil: And the
&s;ingular quality po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by wheat of re&s;i&s;ting,
in its early &s;tate, the cold of our winters,
though, like all other annual plants, it peri&s;hes
<PB N="406" REF="413">
after yielding its &s;eed, and its no le&s;s wonderful
qualities of being nutritious and agreeable to all
men, to many animals, accommodated to almo&s;t
every climate, and can be long pre&s;erved without
corruption, and without lo&s;ing its power of re|production;
all the&s;e circum&s;tances concur in
proving that it is the mo&s;t happy invention ever
di&s;covered by man; and, however ancient it may
be &s;uppo&s;ed, it mu&s;t have been preceded by the
art of agriculture founded upon &s;cience, and
brought to perfection by experience and ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>If more modern and even recent examples of
man's power over the nature of vegetables are
required, we have only to compare our pot|herbs,
our flowers, and our fruits with tho&s;e of
the &s;ame &s;pecies as they exi&s;ted fifty years a|go.
This compari&s;on may be in&s;tantly made,
by in&s;pecting the great collection of flowers,
which was begun in the time of Ga&s;ton d'Or|leans,
and continued to this day, in the Royal
Garden. We &s;hall then perceive, perhaps with
&s;urpri&s;e, that the mo&s;t beautiful flowers of that
period, as the ranunculi, pinks, tulips, auricula,
&amp;c. would now be rejected, not by flori&s;ts alone,
but by the mo&s;t vulgar gardeners. The&s;e flow|ers,
though then cultivated, were not far remo|ved
from their natural &s;tate. A &s;ingle row of
petals or flower leaves, long &s;tamina, and hard
or di&s;agreeable colours, without variety, and
without delicate &s;hades, are the ru&s;tic charac|ters
<PB N="407" REF="414">
of &s;avage nature. Our pot-herbs con&s;i&s;ted
of a &s;ingle &s;pecies of &s;uccory, and two of lattuce,
both very bad; but we have now more than
fifty kinds of lattuce and &s;uccory, all of which
are good. Our be&s;t fruits and nuts, which are
&s;o different from tho&s;e formerly cultivated, that
they have no re&s;emblance but in the name,
mu&s;t likewi&s;e be referred to a very modern
date. In general, &s;ub&s;tances remain, and names
change with times. But, in this ca&s;e, names
remain, and &s;ub&s;tances are changed. Our peach|es,
our apricots, our pears, are new productions
with ancient names. To remove every doubt
upon this &s;ubject, we have only to compare our
flowers and fruits with the de&s;criptions, or ra|ther
notices of them, tran&s;mitted to us by the
Greeks and Romans. All their flowers were
&s;ingle, and all their fruit trees were wild &s;tocks,
and their &s;pecies very ill cho&s;en: Their fruits, of
cour&s;e, were &s;mall, dry, &s;our, and had neither
the flavour nor the beauty of ours.</P>
<P>The&s;e new and good &s;pecies originally &s;prung
from the wild kinds; but, how many thou&s;and
times have their &s;eeds been &s;own before this
happy effect was produced? It was only by &s;ow|ing
and rearing infinite number of vegetables
of the &s;ame &s;pecies, that &s;ome individuals were
recogni&s;ed to bear better and more &s;ucculent
fruit than others; and this fir&s;t di&s;covery, which
&s;uppo&s;es much care and ob&s;ervation, would have
<PB N="408" REF="415">
remained for ever u&s;ele&s;s, if a &s;econd had not
been made, which implies an equal degree of
genius as the fir&s;t required of patience; I mean the
mode of multiplying by engrafting tho&s;e preci|ous
inviduals, which unfortunately cannot propa|gate,
or tran&s;mit their excellent qualities to their
po&s;terity. This fact alone &s;hows that the&s;e quali|ties
are purely individual, and not &s;pecific; for
the &s;eeds of the&s;e excellent fruits, like the infe|rior
kinds, produce nothing but wild &s;tocks,
which are e&s;&s;entially different.</P>
<P>By means of engrafting, however, man has
in a manner created &s;econdary &s;pecies, which
he can multiply at plea&s;ure. The bud or &s;mall
branch, when united to the wild &s;tock, retains
that individual quality which it could not tran&s;|mit
by its &s;eed; and, in order to produce the
&s;ame fruit as its original parent, it requires only
to be developed. The fruits receive none of
the bad qualities of the wild &s;tock; becau&s;e it
has not contributed to their formation: It is not
their mother, but their nur&s;e, which only a&s;|&s;i&s;ts
their growth by conveying nouri&s;hment to
them.</P>
<P>In the animal kingdom, mo&s;t of tho&s;e quali|ties
which appear to be individual, are propaga|ted
and tran&s;mitted in the &s;ame manner as their
&s;pecific qualities. It was, therefore, more ea&s;y
for man to have influence upon the nature of a|nimals
than upon that of vegetables. Particular
<PB N="409" REF="416">
races in any &s;pecies of animals are only con&s;tant
varieties which are perpetuated by generation.
But, in the vegetable kingdom, there are no ra|ces,
no varieties &s;o con&s;tant, as to be perpetuated
by reproduction. In the &s;pecies of the hen and
pigeon, a great number of races have been very
lately produced, all of which propagate their
kinds. In other &s;pecies, we daily rear and improve
races by cro&s;&s;ing the breeds. From time to time,
we naturalize and tame foreign or wild &s;pecies.
All the&s;e recent examples &s;how, that it was long
before man knew the greatne&s;s of his power,
and that he is not yet fully acquainted with its
extent: It depends entirely on the exerci&s;e of
his intellect. Thus the more he &s;hall ob&s;erve
and cultivate nature, the more expedients he will
di&s;cover for making her &s;ubmit, and for draw|ing
from her bo&s;om fre&s;h &s;ources of riches,
without dimini&s;hing the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures
of her fertility.</P>
<P>What influence might not man acquire over
his own &s;pecies, if his inclinations were always
directed by his intelligence? Who knows to what
degree he might improve his moral as well as
his phy&s;ical nature? Is there a &s;ingle nation who
can boa&s;t of having arrived at the be&s;t of po&s;&s;i|ble
governments, a government which would
render all men not equally happy, but le&s;s une|qually
mi&s;erable, by attending to their pre&s;er|vation,
by &s;oftening their labours, and &s;paring
<PB N="410" REF="417">
their blood by cultivating peace and procuring
abundance of provi&s;ions: This is the moral end
of every &s;ociety of men who are anxious to im|prove
their condition: And, with regard to the
phy&s;ical part of our nature, have the medical
and other arts, who&s;e objects are health and
pre&s;ervation, made an equal progre&s;s as the arts
of de&s;truction invented for the purpo&s;es of war
and carnage? In all ages, it appears that man
has reflected deeper and made more re&s;earches
concerning evil than good. In every &s;ociety
there is a mixture of both; and as, of all &s;enti|ments
which affect the multitude, fear is the
mo&s;t powerful, great talents in the art of doing
mi&s;chief were the fir&s;t which &s;truck the mind of
man; he was afterwards occupied with the arts
of amu&s;ement; and it was not till after long
experience in the&s;e two means of fal&s;e honour
and unprofitable plea&s;ure, that he at la&s;t recog|ni&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
his true glory to be &s;cience, and his true
happine&s;s peace.</P>
